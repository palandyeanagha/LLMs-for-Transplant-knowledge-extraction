1. ABSTRACT 
Primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing 
cholangitis are two most frequently encountered cholestatic 
condition in adults. Liver transplantation is an excellent 
option in patients who progress to end-stage liver disease. 
In these patients typical indications for liver transplantation 
are no different than in other conditions requiring 
transplantation. Liver transplantation however might be 
also suggested for specific indications even in patients with 
otherwise well preserved liver function. 5-year survival 
after liver transplantation in primary biliary cirrhosis was 
reported to be between 78 and 87%. Survival rates after 
liver transplantation in primary sclerosing cholangitis are 
considered favorable when compared to many other 
indications for this procedure. Nevertheless, in both 
primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis 
recurrence of the disease after liver transplantation can be 
observed. Cystic fibrosis, biliary atresia, Alagille syndrome 
and progressive familiar intrahepatic cholestasis are 
cholestatic conditions in children. Liver transplantation 
represents an effective treatment in majority of cases 
fulfilling the criteria for this procedure.
2. INTRODUCTION 
In chronic cholestatic disease liver transplantation 
(LTx) may be indicated purely for features of cholestasis, 
including intractable pruritus and malabsorption-induced 
malnutrition. More commonly the indication is a feature of 
hepatocellular failure or portal hypertension arising as a 
consequence of advanced disease. In this review we 
summarize the current knowledge on LTx in the two 
cholestatic condition most frequently encountered in adults; 
primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and primary sclerosing 
cholangitis (PSC). We also discuss briefly the indications 
and outcome of LTx in common cholestatic conditions in 
children. 
3. PRIMARY BILIARY CIRRHOSIS 
PBC is a chronic cholestatic liver condition 
characterized by the damage of interlobular and septal bile 
ducts (1). In an undefined proportion of patients PBC leads 
to progressive fibrosis and eventually cirrhosis (2). Its 
aetiology is considered to be autoimmune but remains to be 
fully elucidated. The disease largely affects middle aged

women and is often associated with various autoimmune 
conditions, of which the commonest are sicca syndrome 
and Hashimoto thyroiditis, usually diagnosed at the stage of 
hypothyroidism. Clinically the commonest complaints are 
of pruritus and chronic fatigue (3). Liver biochemistry 
classically shows elevated alkaline phosphatise and gamma 
glutamyl transpeptidase. The serological hallmark of PBC 
is the M2 antimitochondrial antibody (AMA) which is 
present in a vast majority of patients. The natural history of 
the disease differs widely from patient to patient, in some 
progressing to liver failure within ten years whereas in 
others minimal or no progression is observed over several 
decades. Available medication, namely ursodeoxycholic 
acid, in particular if introduced early in the course of the 
disease may slow progression of the condition in a majority 
of patients but curative medical treatment for PBC does not 
exist (4). LTx is an excellent option in that proportion of 
patients who progress to end-stage liver disease (5). 
3.1. Indications for transplantation and its timing 
In patients with end-stage PBC typical indications 
for LTx are no different than in other conditions requiring 
transplantation and include: refractory ascites, spontaneous 
bacterial peritonitis; hepatocellular carcinoma within the 
defined criteria of Milano/University of San Francisco (6, 
7); recurrent episodes of variceal bleeding or overt 
encephalopathy; progressive muscle wasting. More 
specifically for PBC, intractable pruritus and chronic 
fatigue may also merit consideration for transplant 
assessment. In a small proportion of patients who do not 
respond to any available treatment aimed at amelioration of 
itching, LTx remains the last resort. In such cases LTx 
might be suggested even in patients with otherwise well 
preserved liver function. Chronic fatigue is frequently 
associated with PBC (8) and exerts a significant effect on 
the patient’s quality of life, generating profound disability 
and distress, often out of proportion to the patient`s 
physical status (9). Although chronic fatigue has been a 
rare indication for LTx, the symptom may not be fully 
ameliorated but persist after the procedure (10). 
More generally, LTx is considered when life 
expectancy following surgery clearly exceeds that without 
the operation. It has been shown that in patients with PBC 
the above aim is gained when serum bilirubin reaches 
10mg/dl (170umol/l) (11). It is recommended that patients 
should be referred for their initial assessment when their 
bilirubin approaches 5.9mg/dl (100 µmol/l). The Mayo risk 
score, introduced in 1989, and based on the patient`s age, 
bilirubin, albumin, prothrombin time, presence of 
peripheral oedema, and the necessity of treatment with 
diuretics has been demonstrated to be superior to the 
Child-Pugh score in predicting the outcome of LTx in 
patients with PBC (12). A threshold Mayo risk score of 7.8 
identifies subjects with a significantly increased risk of 
death after LTx (13) and the formula for its calculation is 
available on the internet: http://www.mayoclinic.org/gi￾rst/mayomodel2.html. The Model of End Stage Liver 
Disease (MELD) score, available on the internet 
(http://www.mayoclinic.org/meld/mayomodel6.html), has 
also been found superior to Child-Pugh score in predicting 
mortality in patients with end-stage liver disease awaiting 
LTx (14). This mathematical formula takes into account 
serum bilirubin, INR, creatinine and necessity of dialysis. 
3.2. Transplantation trends 
A recent study from North America, analysing 
the period between 1995 and 2006 demonstrated a clear 
trend towards a reduction in the rate of LTx for PBC (15). 
During that period the overall number of transplants 
showed an average increase of 249 transplants per year 
whereas the number of transplants done for PBC decreased 
gradually by an average of 5.4 cases per year. The median 
age at LTx remained unchanged. These findings are of 
interest in view of the fact that both the incidence and 
prevalence of PBC show a steady increase (16) and suggest 
that ursodeoxycholic acid, which is now almost universally 
prescribed in patients with PBC, has influenced the natural 
history of this condition so as to decrease the need for 
LTx. 
A similar trend has also been observed in Europe. 
Of the 42,957 transplants done between January 1988 and 
June 2009 and recorded by European Liver Transplant 
Registry (ELTR, available on the internet: 
http://www.eltr.org/publi/index_rv.php3), 4377 (10%) were 
performed in patients with PBC. This proportion had 
declined significantly when compared to early days of LTx 
(32). The same tendency was seen within large liver 
transplant centres, the Liver Unit, Birmingham, United 
Kingdom (UK), being a good example. Liermann-Garcia et 
al, in their retrospective study on 400 consecutive patients 
transplanted for PBC showed that the proportion of patients 
transplanted for PBC had dropped from 35% in 1990 to 
21% in 1999 (17). 
3.3. Survival after transplantation 
The ELTR records 1, 5 and 10-years survival 
rates in PBC of 86, 79 and 71% respectively. Five year 
survival in patients with PBC who underwent LTx in 1997 
in North America was 86.2% (10). These data are 
comparable to those reported from large European centres 
where 5-year survival was reported to be between 78 and 
87% (17-19). As observed with other indications for LTx, 
significant improvement of post-transplant survival is seen 
when patients transplanted in the 1980’s and 1990’s are 
compared. For example, data from Birmingham, UK 
showed that patients transplanted in the 1980’s had 3 and 5-
years survival of 70 and 66% compared to 83 and 80% in 
these transplanted in the subsequent decade (17). Similarly, 
Mayo and Dallas data showed an improvement of 3-years 
survival from 72% in 1980’s to 88% in 1990’s (13, 20). 
The 1 and 5-year graft survivals after living donor liver 
transplantation for PBC are 86 and 82%, respectively. 
Patient survivals are 92% and 87%, respectively (21) 
3.4. Recurrence of the disease 
Recurrent PBC after LTx was first reported in 1982 (22) 
and since then numerous studies have confirmed that the 
disease may recur after transplantation. Fatigue and pruritus 
remain the most common clinical symptoms though 
pruritus, in particular, is rarer than in pre-LTx PBC. Unlike 
patients with PBC in their native livers, the majority of 
patients with recurrent PBC have liver

cholestatic enzymes which are either normal or only mildly 
abnormal at the time of diagnosis (23-25). AMA usually 
disappears shortly after LTx but returns later in various 
titres which do not correlate with the development of 
recurrent disease (25). As neither biochemical nor 
serological data are reliable in the diagnosis of the recurrent 
PBC, histology remains crucial for the diagnosis. It usually 
shows granulomatous cholangitis or the florid duct lesion 
(Figure 1). While recurrence of PBC does not exert any 
significant effect on short- and medium-term outcomes, it 
has been speculated that continued follow-up may find 
reduced long-term graft and patient survival due to disease 
recurrence. Indeed, some studies have already documented 
graft loss or death attributed to recurrent disease in a very 
small proportion of patients (17). Selected papers (17, 18, 
23-27) on disease recurrence are summarized in Table 1A. 
According to some experts attention should be focused on 
defining the risk factors for recurrent PBC in order that 
strategies for its prevention and treatment could be 
developed. 
4. PRIMARY SCLEROSING CHOLANGITIS 
PSC is a chronic, inflammatory and cholestatic 
liver condition affecting both intra and extrahepatic bile 
ducts and leading to the formation of multiple biliary 
strictures (28). It may lead to a secondary biliary cirrhosis 
with development of portal hypertension and its 
complications. The aetiology of PSC appears to be 
multifactorial with genetic, autoimmune, inflammatory and 
possibly infective factors all playing their role. Unlike 
PBC, most patients are male and a significant proportion is 
asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. The most common 
complaints are of abdominal pain, icterus, skin itching, and 
recurrent episodes of fever. Inflammatory bowel disease 
(IBD), mostly ulcerative colitis (UC) occurs in up to 75% 
of PSC patients. Endoscopic retrograde 
cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) remains a gold standard 
in the diagnosis of PSC but can be associated with 
complications (pancreatitis, cholangitis). Magnetic 
resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is now 
recommended, particularly in the absence of clinical 
symptoms or imaging studies which demonstrate an 
indication for therapeutic endoscopy. A proportion of 
patients may have normal ERCP/MRCP but suffer from 
IBD and have histology compatible with PSC; this variant 
is called small duct PSC and carries significantly better 
prognosis in terms of disease progression and risk of 
cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) (29). Life time risk of CCA in 
patients with PSC is estimated to be 10-12%. In addition, 
the risk of colorectal cancer in those with PSC and UC is 
estimated to be five-fold higher than for those with UC 
alone, typically involving the right colon. 
4.1. Indications for transplantation and its timing 
In patients with end stage liver disease who 
manifest symptoms of advanced liver failure and features 
of portal hypertension the decision to proceed to 
assessment for liver transplant is straightforward. Patients 
who develop recurrent episodes of cholangitis and who 
have dominant strictures for which endoscopic 
management is not effective are also good candidates due 
to the risks from sepsis. Occasionally, intractable pruritus 
can be in itself an indication for surgery. However such 
patients comprise only a minority of these with PSC. Thus 
the timing of the operation poses a significant challenge in 
this group not least because CCA, once it has developed is 
considered by most centres to be a contraindication to LTx. 
Patients with PSC comprise a population of relatively 
young and frequently clinically stable subjects in whom 

Liver transplantation in cholestatic conditions

prophylactic LTx, merely on the grounds that 10-15% of 
them may at one point develop CCA, cannot be justified; 
such apparent benefit is counterbalanced by the short-term 
mortality which follows LTx. Effective surveillance for 
CCA does not exist and its detection leaves the caring 
hepatologist with an extremely difficult clinical impasse. 
To circumvent this, authors from Mayo Clinic proposed a 
protocol embracing scrupulous staging and neoadjuvant 
chemoradiation which permitted LTx in carefully selected 
patients with PSC and CCA and were able to obtain 5 year 
survival in 82% of patients as compared to only 21% in 
these who underwent surgical resection (30). 
4.2. Transplantation trends 
The United Network for Organ Sharing database 
showed that in spite of a steady raise of the overall number 
of liver transplants in the United States between 1995 and 
2006, the number of transplants for PSC showed no change 
over the same period (15). Interestingly, there was a 
tendency towards a decline in placing patients with PSC on 
the waiting list. Interpretation of this observation is difficult 
as in terms of the number of transplants it may be related to 
the relatively low MELD scores held by the patients and 
better pre-transplant treatment (ursodeoxycholic acid, 
endoscopic methods). 
4.3. Survival after transplantation 
Survival rates after LTx in PSC are considered 
favourable when compared to many other indications for 
this procedure. Because the disease frequently affects the 
common bile duct and may recur after LTx, the preferred 
biliary anastomosis in patients with PSC is a Roux-en-Y 
choledochojejunostomy. A single centre study from the 
Mayo Clinic comprising 150 consecutive subjects 
transplanted for this indication showed actuarial patient 
survival at 1, 2, 5, and 10 years of 94%, 92%, 86%, and 
70%, respectively, and corresponding rates for graft 
survival of 83%, 83%, 79%, and 61%. (31). The most 
recent and the largest study in this field from Birmingham, 
UK which included 230 consecutive PSC patients showed 
overall 1, 5 and 10 years patients survival of 80%, 68% and 
57% and graft survival of 75%, 60% and 50% respectively 
(32). As overall survival may be influenced by the risk of 
colorectal cancer in patients with concomitant UC it is 
recommended that these patients should undergo annual 
surveillance colonoscopy. Unlike UC which occurs in the 
absence of PSC, colitis is typically right sided, may spare 
the rectum (33) and enhance the risk of right sided colonic 
cancer (34). The 1 and 5-year graft survivals after living 
donor liver transplantation for PSC are 90 and 80%, 
respectively. Patient survivals are 97% and 87%, 
respectively (21).
4.4. Recurrence of the disease 
PSC may recur after surgery in up to 37% of 
patients (35). It is essential that other risk factors for non￾anastomotic biliary strictures have been excluded before 
the diagnosis of recurrent PSC is made. It has been reported 
that an active IBD requiring steroids, male gender and the 
history of acute rejection all increase the risk of recurrent 
PSC. It has also been suggested that the presence of an 
intact colon significantly increases the risk of recurrence. In 
their initial report Vera et al have shown that cumulative, 
10 years risk of PSC recurrence after grafting in patients in 
whom their colons were removed before or during LTx was 
0.1 as compared to 0.7 in these who had their colons intact 
(35). They also showed that recurrence may lead to graft 
loss and necessity of re-grafting. These observations have 
been recently confirmed by the same group in a larger 
cohort of patients. A diagnosis of recurrent PSC was made 
in 61 (23%) out of 263 transplanted grafts. They found that 
colectomy before LTx confers a protective effect against 
recurrence of PSC and this should therefore be a significant 
factor in deciding for or against colectomy at the time of 
LTx. Of importance, 23 grafts were lost due to recurrence 
and required retransplantation (32). The most recent 
American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases 
Practice Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of 
PSC do not suggest any particular treatment of recurrent 
PSC. Selected studies (35-41) on recurrence of PSC after 
LTx are shown in Table 1B. 
5. CHOLESTATIC CONDITIONS WHICH 
MANIFEST IN CHILDHOOD 
5.1. Cystic fibrosis 
Cystic fibrosis (CF), one of the most common 
autosomal recessive diseases, is caused by a mutation in the 
gene for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance 
regulator (CFTR) (42). CFTR is a chloride channel 
involved in production of sweat, digestive juices and mucus 
(43). CFTR dysfunction causes exocrine secretions to be 
thick and viscous, resulting in a multiorgan disorder with 
manifestations involving the respiratory and 
gastrointestinal tracts, sweat glands, and other exocrine 
tissues. While life expectancy has increased significantly in 
recent decades due to improvements in pulmonary 
management and anti-infectious therapy, (44, 45) liver 
disease has become more prevalent and is now considered 
to be the second most common cause of death associated 
with CF (46). About 17% of patients with CF develop 
clinically significant liver disease (47). In these patients 
hepatosplenomegaly and ascites diminish diaphragmatic 
movement, thus further impairing the already compromised 
lung function. Once portal hypertension is established, the 
prognosis is poor (48). LTx offers the only potentially 
curative treatment (49), however coexisting restrictive lung 
disease makes the transplant surgery challenging. 
Combined, triple heart-lung-liver transplantation has been 
performed in patients with both end-stage liver and lung 
disease, but the outcomes were unsatisfactory, (50) 
although at least one patient in the Birmingham series 
survived more than 20 years following such a triple 
transplant for CF (personal communication). It is surmised 
that unusually long term functioning of transplanted lungs 
in multi-organ transplantees is in part due to the graft 
tolerance which ensues from implanting a greater 
mass/load of donor antigens (51). Nevertheless, shortage of 
donors for lung transplantation has diminished enthusiasm 
for combined liver and lung or heart-lung-liver 
transplantation in CF. Success from isolated LTx in CF 
patients was initially considered highly unlikely because of 
the risk of infection associated with posttransplant 
immunosupression, exacerbating pulmonary disease (52).

infiltrates of portal tract area. B. Proliferation and damage 
of bile ducts. (Courtesy of prof. E. Urasinska, Dept of 
Pathology, Pomeranian Medical University) 
Nonetheless several studies have now shown that 
single organ LTx is beneficial for patients with CF. Correct 
selection of patients and optimal timing for transplantation 
are crucial to such success. Studies have shown that 
awaiting progress to end-stage lung disease is associated 
with a significantly worse outcome of LTx (50). Therefore 
LTx should be considered in younger patients with well￾preserved lung function. In these patients stabilization or 
even improvement in respiratory function after LTx have 
been reported (50, 53-55). To help in assessment of these 
patients for LTx we proposed a simple scoring system (49) 
which modifies the previous score designed by Noble￾Jamieson et al (53) and in our cohort, showed significantly 
improved discriminative value. In patients receiving LTx 
for cystic fibrosis postoperative prophylactic antimicrobial 
management is mandatory to prevent exacerbation of 
respiratory infections due to high dose induction of 
immunosupression (49). On the positive side, LTx may 
provide relief of intraabdominal pressure, diaphragmatic 
splinting, intrapulmonary shunting and remove the 
contribution of hypoalbuminemia to pulmonary edema 
(56). Furthermore, it is postulated, that steroidal and non￾steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, along with 
immunosuppression block cytokine production, resulting in 
decreased airway inflammation (49, 57, 58). In addition to 
pulmonary issues, the posttransplant period in patients with 
CF is associated with increased risk of biliary problems and 
severe ascites, when compared with patients undergoing 
LTx for other indications. Postoperative biliary anastamotic 
strictures occur mainly when the recipient’s common bile 
duct is used for biliary reconstruction and several studies 
have shown that it can be avoided by using a Roux-en-Y 
choledochojejunostomy (54, 55, 59). Severe ascites is more 
frequent in malnourished patients and significantly worsens 
postoperative outcome (60). This emphasizes the 
significance of intensive nutritional support during the 
pretransplant period and listing the patient for LTx before 
advanced malnutrition develops (49). Thus single LTx is 
now considered to be acceptable therapy in selected, young 
patients with well preserved pulmonary function, with the 
expectation that it will lead to improvements in respiratory 
function and relief of portal hypertension. Posttransplant 1- 
and 10-year survival ranges from 75% to 91,6% (53, 54, 
61) and from 56% to 67%, respectively (54, 60) and is 
comparable to that achieved when LTx has been performed 
for other indications. 
5.2. Biliary atresia 
Biliary atresia (BA), one of the most common 
causes of neonatal cholestasis, is the indication for LTx in 
over 50% of pediatric cases. The disease is characterized by 
complete fibroinflammatory obliteration of the extrahepatic 
biliary system with variable involvement of the intrahepatic 
ducts, resulting in severe cholestasis, liver cirrhosis and if 
untreated, death in early childhood (62). The cause of BA is 
most likely multifactorial and remains to be elucidated 
(63). Ten to thirty five percent of patients exhibit associated 
anomalies, mainly congenital heart disease. No medical 
treatment is effective and surgical intervention is the only 
option for the management of BA. There is no consensus as 
to whether Kasai portoenterostomy or LTx is the best initial 
therapy (64-66). Kasai portoenterostomy has excellent 
medium term results, provided the procedure is performed 
by an experienced surgeon within the few first months of a 
patient’s life, before liver cirrhosis is developed (67, 68). 
Nevertheless, more than 60% of infants undergoing the 
Kasai portoenterostomy ultimately require LTx because of 
progressive liver damage and portal hypertension (69, 70). 
Small children can be successfully transplanted by use of a 
reduced-size deceased liver graft or a portion of the liver 
from a living-related donor (71, 71, 72). Overall, 1- and 5-
year survival rates in Patients who underwent LTx for BA 
are estimated to be 93% and 85%, respectively, which is 
considered the best outcome following pediatric 
transplantation of any group of patients (72-74). 
5.3. Alagille syndrome 
Alagille syndrome (AS) is an autosomal 
dominant disorder caused by mutations in the JAG1 gene 
encoding a critical ligand in the Notch signalling pathway, 
that is involved in ultimate cell fate determination (75-77). 
Defects in the pathway are associated with multisystemic 
developmental anomalies including interlobular bile duct 
paucity, congenital heart disease, ocular abnormalities, 
sagittal cleft (“butterfly-like”) vertebrae, mental retardation 
and characteristic facial features (78-80). Clinical 
manifestations in AS vary greatly, from a mild phenotype 
to severe cardiovascular and renal disease (81). Congenital 
heart disease is the main cause of poor outcome in early 
childhood (80). In many children with longer survival 

Liver transplantation in cholestatic conditions 
964
persistent cholestasis may lead to severe drug-resistant 
pruritus and in approximately 20% of patients to biliary 
cirrhosis. Many patients with AS require LTx for end-stage 
liver disease, however some subjects may benefit from LTx 
even without coexisting cirrhosis. This applies to patients 
with severe hypercholesterolemia and profound growth 
retardation unresponsive to enteral nutritional support (82). 
Intractable pruritus is nowadays a less common reason for LTx 
because of its responsiveness to partial biliary diversion (80, 
83). The decision to list for LTx in patients with AS can be 
difficult because of the variety of extrahepatic manifestations 
and must take into consideration associated cardiovascular and 
renal morbidities. Therefore a careful preoperative assessment 
has to be performed, which in selected cases includes 
angiographic evaluations and dynamic stress tests, imitating 
hemodynamic conditions during surgery (84). A full clinical 
evaluation is also required in cases of living-related LTx as 
donors are likely to share disease-causing mutations (85). 
Twenty five percent of children with AS require LTx during 
their childhood (80), with a median age at the time of operation 
ranging from 3,5 to 7,8 years; they account for approximately 
5% of all indications for pediatric LTx (84). The outcome of 
LTx is generally comparable to the results seen in other 
chronic cholestatic conditions in children (85), the risk of 
hemorrhagic complications being the most important factor 
limiting overall survival rates (80, 82, 84). This 
posttransplant bleeding has been linked to arterial 
hypertension secondary to high-dose steroid therapy and 
coexisting arterial malformations. Therefore, it is very 
important to properly control post-transplant arterial blood 
pressure (82). 
5.4. Progressive familiar intrahepatic cholestasis 
Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis 
(PFIC) refers to a wide spectrum of different autosomal 
recessive defects involving bile formation and its 
canalicular excretion. PFIC typically manifests itself in the 
first year of life with intense and persistent pruritus, 
recurrent episodes of jaundice, and features related to fat￾soluble vitamin malabsorption. Liver damage is progressive 
and, if untreated, typically leads to cirrhosis within the first 
decade of life (86). However, depending of the type of 
genetic defect, PFIC may present as both more severe and 
milder phenotypes. 
5.4.1. PFIC1, Byler disease 
PFIC1 is a result of genetic defects in the 
ATP8B1 gene encoding the membrane protein ATPase 
class I type 8B (ATP8B1). ATP8B1 is involved in 
aminophospholipid translocation from the outer to the inner 
leaflet of the plasma membrane (87-89). ATP8B1 is 
expressed not only in liver tissue but also in various other 
organs, thus accounting for extrahepatic manifestations 
including secretory diarrhoea, sensorineural hearing loss, 
recurrent pancreatitis and chronic respiratory problems 
(90). So far, there is no clear explanation why loss of 
ATP8B1 activity causes liver disease, however alteration in 
bile acid homeostasis has been proposed as a possible cause 
of PFIC1 related liver damage (88). This idea is supported 
by the fact that surgical interruption of the enterohepatic 
bile acid circulation by partial external biliary diversion or 
ileal exclusion stabilizes or even improves liver histology 
and reduces pruritus in these patients (91-93). Because 
PFIC1 is potentially a systemic disorder, it is not 
completely corrected by LTx. Post-transplant, intractable 
chronic refractory diarrhea, pancreatitis, and persistent 
growth retardation has been reported in patients with 
PFIC1. Moreover after LTx some patients develop 
progressive fatty liver disease leading to cirrhosis (90). The 
cause of this phenomenon is unknown and intriguing. 
Development of graft damage and the increasing 
effectiveness of non-transplant surgical treatment 
nowadays combine to make PFIC1 a disputable indication 
for LTx. 
5.4.2. PFIC2: Bile salt export pump disease 
PFIC2 is caused by genetic defects in the 
ABCB11 gene that encodes the bile salt export pump 
(BSEP) which is expressed exclusively at the hepatocyte 
canalicular membrane (94, 95). BSEP is the major canalicular 
bile acid pump, and ABCB11 mutations are responsible for 
severe cholestasis and hepatocellular damage progressing to 
end-stage liver disease. Moreover, PFIC2 is associated with a 
high risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and CCA even in early 
childhood (96, 97). Early-onset liver damage and high risk of 
malignancy are the reasons why LTx is usually necessary 
before adolescence (98, 99). As PFIC2 is a liver-specific 
condition, LTx corrects all of the problems associated with 
BSEP deficiency. However, rarely, patients who have 
undergone LTx for PFIC2 develop a recurrence of their 
cholestasis, mimicking BSEP deficiency. This phenomenon is 
considered as an alloimmune response against the donor BSEP 
proteins in patients immunologically ‘‘naive” for BSEP (99-
101). 
5.4.3. PFIC3: MDR3 disease 
PFIC3 is caused by mutations in the MDR3 gene 
(also designated ABCB4). Class III Multidrug Resistance 
(MDR3) P-glycoprotein is a phospholipid translocator in 
the canalicular cell membrane involved in biliary 
phosphatidylcholine excretion (102). Patients with MDR3 
dysfunction produce phospholipid-deficient, abnormally 
caustic bile that damages the hepatocytes and intrahepatic 
bile ducts. The absence of phospholipids also promotes 
lithogenicity of the bile leading to biliary obstruction (103). 
In PFIC3, patients have clinical symptoms similar to those 
in other types of PFIC, but liver damage progresses slowly. 
Ursodeoxycholic acid therapy has proven effective in 
patients with a partial MDR3 defect (104), but in the 
majority of cases LTx represents the only effective therapy. 
PFIC3 is liver-specific, so LTx is not complicated by 
extrahepatic disease and these patients have a good 
prognosis after successful LTx. The use of living related 
donors, who are likely to be heterozygous for the disease￾causing gene, does not appear to compromise the outcome 
of LTx (105).
