Abstract
Neutrophils play an important role in innate immunity by defending the host organism against invading microorganisms.
Antimicrobial activity of neutrophils is mediated by release of antimicrobial peptides, phagocytosis as well as formation of
neutrophil extracellular traps (NET). These structures are composed of DNA, histones and granular proteins such as
neutrophil elastase and myeloperoxidase. This study focused on the influence of NET on the host cell functions, particularly
on human alveolar epithelial cells as the major cells responsible for gas exchange in the lung. Upon direct interaction with
epithelial and endothelial cells, NET induced cytotoxic effects in a dose-dependent manner, and digestion of DNA in NET did
not change NET-mediated cytotoxicity. Pre-incubation of NET with antibodies against histones, with polysialic acid or with
myeloperoxidase inhibitor but not with elastase inhibitor reduced NET-mediated cytotoxicity, suggesting that histones and
myeloperoxidase are responsible for NET-mediated cytotoxicity. Although activated protein C (APC) did decrease the
histone-induced cytotoxicity in a purified system, it did not change NET-induced cytotoxicity, indicating that histone￾dependent cytotoxicity of NET is protected against APC degradation. Moreover, in LPS-induced acute lung injury mouse
model, NET formation was documented in the lung tissue as well as in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. These data reveal
the important role of protein components in NET, particularly histones, which may lead to host cell cytotoxicity and may be
involved in lung tissue destruction.

Introduction
Neutrophils are the most abundant type of white blood cells in
mammals, which represent an essential part of the innate immune
system and are considered as the first line of defense against
microorganisms. After recruitment to the inflammatory site,
neutrophils attack invading pathogens by release of antimicrobial
peptides and lytic enzymes as well as production of reactive oxygen
species (ROS) followed by phagocytosis that enables clearance of
the invading pathogens [1–3]. Another recently described
antimicrobial mechanism of neutrophils is the formation of
neutrophil extracellular traps (NET). These structures are
composed of DNA in association with histones, as the most
abundant proteins in NET, as well as granular proteins such as
elastase and myeloperoxidase and several cytoplasmic proteins.
Inflammatory stimuli such as interleukin-8, lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) provoke ‘‘NETosis’’ of
neutrophils. During this cell-destructive process, which is distinct
from classical apoptosis or necrosis, intracellular organelle
membranes disintegrate after decondensation of materials in the
nucleus, allowing the mixing of cytoplasmic and nuclear
components which is followed by the rupture of plasma membrane
to expel NET. These structures can bind and kill bacteria and
fungi [4–7], whereby NET-associated proteins such as elastase and
histones exhibit bactericidal and leishmanicidal activity [5,8].
However, excessive activation of neutrophils may lead to the
development of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and lungs
are the main target of this syndrome [9–11]. Acute lung injury
(ALI) and its more severe form acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS) represent pathological situations of lung dysfunction
characterized by impairment in the alveolar-capillary barrier
function that result from complex responses of the lung to a
multitude of direct and indirect insults [12–14]. Activated
neutrophils contribute to lung injury by releasing proteolytic
enzymes, ROS and other proinflammatory mediators [15].
Alveolar epithelial cell function and barrier integrity are crucial
to preserve normal gas exchange, and injury or loss of epithelial
cells may lead to progression of ALI/ARDS [16,17]. ARDS
carries high mortality rates between 40% and 60% in affected
patients [18]. Therefore, understanding of the mechanisms in the
development of ALI/ARDS is essential for developing novel
therapeutic options to treat these patients [19,20]. Besides ALI,
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 February 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 2 | e32366

other lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis are associated with lung
epithelial cell death. In cystic fibrosis patients, progressive infection
and inflammation in the lower airways results in the destruction of
small and medium airways in lung, and extracellular DNA
accumulates in the airway due to the chronic bacterial infection
[21].
Although elevated amounts of NET were observed in several
pathophysiological conditions in vivo [5,22–28] and exaggerated
NET formation was correlated with damaging effects and
impaired tissue function [29–31], the direct effect of NET and
their components on host cells have not been investigated. In this
study, the direct influence of isolated NET on alveolar epithelial
cells (as the major cells responsible for gas exchange in the lung) as
well as endothelial cells was examined, indicating that NET and
particularly the histone components are responsible for cell death
in lung epithelial and endothelial cells.
Materials and Methods
Cell culture
A549-human lung adenocarcinoma cell line and mouse lung
epithelial cells (MLE-12) were obtained from American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). Human
pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAEC) were obtained from
Lonza (Germany). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(HUVEC) and murine alveolar type II (AT-II) cells were isolated
as described [32,33]. Human neutrophils were isolated from
healthy donors using density gradient separation according to
Costa and co-workers [34]. Briefly, a double gradient was formed
by layering an equal volume of histopaque-1077 over histopaque￾1119 (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany). Venous blood was collected in
EDTA tubes and carefully layered onto the upper histopaque￾1077, followed by centrifugation at 7006 g for 30 min and
granulocytes were concentrated at the 1077/1119 interphase.
Purity of isolated cells (.96%) was assessed by FACS following
labeling the cells with neutrophil-specific marker CD66b (anti￾bodies-online, Germany), and viability was determined to be 98%
by trypan blue dye exclusion. For neutrophil isolation, human
blood taken from healthy volunteer donors with verbal consent
was provided by the Blood Bank (Clinical Immunology, Blood
Transfusion Medicine, University Hospital Giessen) and data were
analyzed anonymously.
Isolation of neutrophils from bronchoalveolar lavage
fluid (BALF) and immunofluorescence microscopy of
isolated neutrophils
To generate ALI, C57BL/6 mice (n = 3 per group) were treated
intratracheally with 10 mg of LPS from Escherichia coli (serotype
0111.B4, Sigma Aldrich) in 50 ml of PBS. Control mice were treated
with PBS only [35–37]. Intratracheal applications of LPS or PBS
were done essentially as described elsewhere [38,39]. Briefly, mice
were anesthetized with ketamine and tetrazoline hydrochloride, and
the trachea was exposed. Subsequently, catheter (Abbot, Wiesba￾den, Germany) was inserted into trachea, and LPS or PBS was
installed under stereomicroscopic control (MS5; Leica Microsys￾tems, Wetzlar, Germany). After installation, wounds were closed,
and mice were allowed to recover with free access to food and water.
For BALF collection, mice were killed with an overdose of isoflurane
(Forene; Abbott, Wiesbaden, Germany). Subsequently, trachea was
exposed, and a small incision was made to insert a shortened 21-
gauge cannula connected to a 1-ml insulin syringe, followed by
repeated intratracheal instillations of 0.5 ml aliquots of PBS [38,39].
After 24 h, BALF was collected and mouse neutrophils were
isolated by anti-Ly-6G MicroBead Kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Isolated neutrophils were
seeded on coverslips and treated with 25 nM PMA (Sigma-Aldrich)
for 1.5 h at 37uC. Samples were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde,
blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS and incubated with
primary mouse anti-DNA Histone H1 (Millipore, Germany) and
rabbit anti-CD46 (H-294) (Santa Cruz, Germany), followed by
detection with secondary antibodies coupled to Alexa Fluor 555
donkey anti-mouse IgG and Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-rabbit
(Invitrogen, Germany), respectively. DAPI (Vectashield mounting
medium with DAPI; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA)
was used for nuclear DNA detection. For negative controls either
the primary antibodies were omitted or the isotype-matched
controls were used. Images were taken with fluorescence micro￾scope using MetaMorph imaging software version series 7.0 (Leica
Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). All animal experiments were
approved by ethical approval (approval ID 67/2009) from the
Ethics Committee of the University of Giessen, School of Medicine.
BALF collection, MNase digestion and neutrophil elastase
activity
C57BL/6 mice were treated intratracheally with LPS as
mentioned above, and BALF was collected after 3, 6, 12, 24
and 48 h following treatment. Control mice were treated with PBS
only. BALF samples were centrifuged 10006 g for 5 min. The
supernatants were collected separately and 500 mU/ml micro￾coccal nuclease from Staphylococcus aureus (MNase) (Sigma-Aldrich)
were added to each pellet [4]. Both digested pellet (to detect NET￾derived elastase) and supernatant (to detect free elastase) were
incubated with peptide substrate N-(methoxysuccinyl)-Ala-Ala￾Pro-Val 4-nitroanilide (Sigma Aldrich) for 15 min and the optical
density was measured at 405 nm (Ultra microplate reader ELx
808; BIO-TEK Instruments, Germany).
Immunofluorescence microscopy of mouse lung
Frozen 5 mm lung tissue sections from mice treated intratra￾cheally for 24 h with 10 mg LPS or PBS only were equilibrated to
room temperature and fixed in acetone for 10 min. Vector
M.O.M. Immunodetection Kit (Vector Laboratories) was used
with some modification in the protocol. Briefly, after blocking the
sections with M.O.M Mouse Ig Blocking Reagent for 1 h, samples
were incubated with primary antibodies anti-CD46 or anti￾neutrophil elastase (M-18; Santa Cruz) followed by a secondary
antibody coupled to Alexa Fluor 488 and anti-DNA/histone 1
coupled with Alexa Fluor 546 (Invitrogen). In addition, some
sections were incubated with primary antibodies against myelo￾peroxidase (L-20; Santa Cruz) and citrullinated H3 (2+8+17)
[CitH3] (Abcam), followed by detection with secondary antibodies
coupled to Alexa Fluor 555 donkey anti-mouse IgG and Alexa
Fluor 488 donkey anti-rabbit, respectively. For negative controls
either the primary antibodies were omitted or the isotype-matched
controls were used. DAPI was used for DNA detection.
Histone treatment of cells
A549 cells and HUVEC were treated with different concentra￾tions of histone type IIA from calf (Sigma-Aldrich). Cell
morphology was inspected under the light microscope and the
cell numbers were counted by CASY Cell Counter System
(Schaerfe Systems, Reutlingen, Germany).
NET production, isolation and quantification
Isolated human neutrophils were resuspended in phenol red–
free RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen), and 1.86106 cells were seeded per
well in 6-well plates. Following stimulation with 50 nM PMA for
NET and Host Cell Cytotoxicity
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 February 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 2 | e32366

4 h, medium was removed and wells were washed with RPMI.
PMA, at this concentration, does not promote apoptosis or
necrosis; rather, it induces typical features of NETosis [4,40–44].
To collect NET, 2 ml RPMI per well was added and NET (the
smear on the wells) was collected in 15 ml tubes by vigorous
agitation. After centrifugation at 206 g for 5 min, NET was
collected in the supernatant and subjected to different treat￾ments, including partial digestion by 500 U/ml MNase for
10 min at 37uC or complete digestion by 10 U/ml DNase I
(Fermentas, Germany) for 20 min at 37uC or kept undigested.
For some experiments, NET was heated for 5 min at 95uC
(‘‘boiled NET’’). Quantification of DNA in NET was performed
by Picogreen dsDNA kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufac￾turer’s instructions.
Treatment of endothelial or epithelial cells with NET
HUVEC, HPAEC or A549, MLE-12, AT-II cells were seeded
in 24-well plates to reach 90% confluency, washed once with PBS,
and NET in different concentrations were added. Approximately
3.4 (NET) or 10.1 (36NET) mg/ml DNA-NET, respectively, was
added to different wells. Some cells were treated with 3.3 mg/ml
staurosporine (Sigma-Aldrich) as a cell death inducer and some left
untreated as negative controls. The total volume in each well was
kept equal by adding RPMI medium. Cell morphology evaluation
was also performed with the non-confluent cells by MetaMorph
software using integrated morphometry analysis. Cells were
analyzed after 4 h or 16 h incubation at 37uC with different
measurements as indicated in the following methods.
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release or cytotoxcicity
assay
Epithelial or endothelial cells were treated with 1% Triton X￾100 (high control), with NET or kept untreated (low control). LDH
release into the supernatant was assessed by cytotoxicity detection
kit (Roche Applied Science, Germany) according to the manufac￾turer’s instructions. The degree of cytotoxicity was calculated as
follows:
Cytotoxicity (%)~ exp:value{low control
high control{low control|100
Where ‘‘exp.value’’ is the average absorbance (of four wells) from
the experimental data.
Multi-caspase activity
A549 cells were left untreated or treated with NET, staur￾osporine or caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK as an additional
negative control, and green multi-caspase staining kit (Promokine,
Germany) was used to detect activated caspases in living cells
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The fluorescence
intensity was measured at exitation and emission wavelengths of
485 nm and 535 nm, respectively (FLx 800 fluorescence micro￾plate reader; BIO-TEK Instruments).
Detection of Annexin V and ethidium homodimer III
positive cells by fluorescence microscopy
Untreated (control) and NET- or staurosporine-treated A549
cells were stained with FITC-Annexin V, ethidium homodimer
III and Hoechst 33342 (Promokine, Germany) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Annexin V and ethidium homodi￾mer III positive cells were evaluated by fluorescence microscopy
and MetaMorph software using integrated morphometry
analysis.
Treatment of histone and NET by activated protein C
(APC)
Histone from calf thymus (Type II-A; Sigma-Aldrich) (100 or
200 mg/ml) was incubated with 6 mg/ml (100 nM) APC (Xigris,
Eli Lilly) for 1 h at 37uC [45]. In addition, NET (approximately
10 mg/ml protein content), digested or non-digested, was incubat￾ed with 100 nM APC for different time points. Moreover, NET
was incubated with APC at different mass ratios of APC: NET
(1:5, 1:2, and 1:1) for 1 h at 37uC. APC alone or APC plus 6 mM
APC inhibitor, PPACK (Calbiochem, Germany) were used as
controls. LDH release by A549 cells was measured after treatment
with histones, APC, NET, APC-pretreated histones or APC￾pretreated NET.
Elastase activity of human neutrophils and isolated NET
In order to evaluate elastase activity and its inhibition in NET,
human neutrophils were kept untreated as unstimulated samples
(Unstim) or stimulated with 50 nM PMA for 4 h (Stim) and the
supernatants were collected for elastase activity. NET was also
isolated from the stimulated samples as described under ‘‘NET
production, isolation and quantification’’. Thereafter, NET
samples were digested with DNase or MNase or kept undigested
followed by centrifugation at 10006 g for 5 min, and the
supernatants were collected for elastase activity in the absence or
presence of 0.2 mM N-(methoxysuccinyl)-L-alanyl-L-alanyl-L￾prolyl-L-valine chloromethyl ketone (Sigma-Aldrich) as an elastase
inhibitor.
NET-protein quantification
For NET-protein quantification the Micro-BCA protein assay
reagent kit (Pierce, Germany) or the 2D-Quant kit (GE
Healthcare) was used. Both methods resulted in the same values
of protein concentration.
Inhibition of NET cytotoxicity
To test the influence of NET on cytotoxicity, 800 ml NET
(approximately 10 mg protein content) was pre-incubated with
1:100 of the following histone antibodies: H2A antibody (Cell
signaling, Germany), H3 antibody (Millipore), citrullinated H3
(2+8+17) antibody [CitH3] (Abcam, Germany) or H4 antibody
(Cell signaling) or with 8 mg of the subsequent antibodies: DNA/
histone H1 antibody (Millipore, German), H2B antibody (Milli￾pore), mouse IgG isotype antibody (M4509; Sigma-Aldrich) or
rabbit IgG isotype antibody (Dianova, Germany) for 1 h at room
temperature before incubation of NET with A549 cells. In
addition, 800 ml NET was pre-incubated with 0.125, 0.25, 0.5 or
1 mM neutrophil elastase inhibitor N-(methoxysuccinyl)-Ala-Ala￾Pro-Val-chloromethyl ketone, with 37 ng/ml myeloperoxidase
inhibitor dihydrolipoic acid (gift from Dr. Oliver Soehnlein,
Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich) or with 10 ı`g polysialic
acid (colominic acid a´2,8-linked Neu5Ac polymer of E.coli K1 -
equivalent to polySia in mammalians) (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h at
room temperature prior to incubation of NET with A549 or AT-II
cells. As a control, 50 mg/ml isolated histones were pre-incubated
with 50 mg/ml polysialic acid or 1:100 antibody against histone
H4 for 1 h at room temperature before incubation with the cells.
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed by GraphPad Prism 5.02 software using
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey post-tests for
multiple comparisons or by student’s t-test for single measure￾ments. Each experiment was performed at least three times on
independent occasions unless otherwise stated. Differences were

considered statistically significant at p,0.05. In the figures,
significant differences were illustrated with asterisks (*p,0.05;
**p,0.01; ***p,0.001).
Results
NET induce cell death in epithelial cells in a
concentration-dependent manner
To study the effect of NET on epithelial cells, A549 cells were
incubated with MNase-digested NET or staurosporine for 4 h or
16 h. While untreated cells grew normally and became confluent,
cells treated with staurosporine or NET did not reach confluency
(Fig. 1A and B). Vigorous agitation of unstimulated neutrophils
incubated for 4 h at 37uC will disturb the intact neutrophils, and
may result in the release of all components of neutrophils which
are not equivalent to NET, and cannot be used as controls;
therefore, only the untreated cells were used as controls. Multi￾caspase activity in A549 cells increased significantly after exposure
to staurosporine or NET in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1C).
Moreover, NET exposure increased the fractions of annexin V
and ethidium homodimer (a membrane-impermeable fluorescent
dye which binds to DNA) positive cells (Fig. 1D and E). Proteomic
analysis of NET-treated epithelial cells (Materials and Methods S1)
also revealed up-regulation of proteins involved in cell death
(Table S1). Together, these data indicate that NET can induce
lung epithelial cell death in a concentration-dependent manner.
NET induce cytotoxicity in epithelial and endothelial cells
independent of DNA digestion
In order to investigate in detail the role of DNA digestion in
NET-mediated cytotoxicity, different forms of NET were used:
undigested (containing long DNA fibers), completely digested by
DNase (containing mostly oligonucleotides) or partially digested by
MNase (containing smaller DNA fragments but not nucleotides)
(Fig. S1). Moreover, DNA alone, the same concentration as used
in DNA-NET, was used as another control. The extent of
cytotoxicity in A549 cells after incubation with NET substantially
(approximately 60%) increased (Fig. 2A), and DNase or MNase

treatment of NET did not change their cytotoxic activity.
Incubation of cells with DNase, MNase or DNA alone as well as
boiled NET did not provoke any appreciable cytotoxicity. To
identify whether this effect of NET is also seen in other cells rather
than A459, endothelial cells such as HUVEC and HPAEC as well
as other lung epithelial cells such as MLE-12 and AT-II cells were
incubated with undigested or DNA-digested NET, which induced
similar cytotoxicity (Fig. 2B). Together, these data indicate that
DNA digestion in NET does not change the cytotoxic activity of
NET, and the DNA component in NET (either undigested or
fragmented) is not responsible for its cytotoxic effect.
Histones induce epithelial and endothelial cell death
Identification of spots from 2-D gel electrophoresis of NET by
mass spectrometry confirmed the presence of different proteins,
the majority of which had been described by Urban and co￾workers [7]. Some additional newly identified proteins were listed
as well (Table S2). To elucidate the relevance of histones as the
major protein components of NET structure [7] for NET￾mediated cytotoxicity, the influence of pure histones on both
epithelial and epithelial cell death was investigated. NET contains
all types of histones; therefore, commercially available purified
histones (histone type-IIA, which includes all types of histones)
were used for treatment with the cells. Incubation of epithelial and
endothelial cells with histone type-IIA prevented cell growth, and
provoked cytotoxicity in a concentration-dependent manner
(Fig. 3). These data together with the previous studies [45]
confirms the cytotoxic capability of histones on the host cells.
Histone antibodies and polysialic acid decrease NET￾mediated cytotoxicity
It was recently described that APC and histone antibodies can
decrease histone-mediated cytotoxicity in endothelial cells [45].
Likewise, the cytotoxic activity of purified histones on A549 cells
was significantly decreased by APC (Fig. 4A). In contrast,
incubation of NET with APC even in high doses did not reduce
NET-mediated cytotoxicity (Fig. 4B). Moreover, incubation of
DNase or undigested forms of NET with APC up to 80 min could
not decrease NET-mediated cytotoxicity (Fig. 4C and D). SDS-gel
electrophoresis of NET proteins before or after incubation with
APC and the subsequent identification with MALDI-TOF-MS did
not show histone degradation (Fig. S2B). Likewise, two-dimen￾sional difference in gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE), which enables
accurate analysis of differences in protein abundance between

different concentrations of histones, and the extent of cytotoxity was measured. B and D are representative data of three independent experiments,
and in A and C pictures are representative pictures from three independent experiments at 206magnification.

samples, did not show any difference between untreated NET and
NET treated with APC (Fig. S2D), implying that histones in NET
are protected against APC degradation. However, pre-incubation
of NET with histone antibodies against DNA/H1, H2A, H2B and
H4 but not H3 and citrullinated H3 significantly decreased NET￾mediated cytotoxicity (Fig. 5A). Moreover, a recent study showed
that polysialic acid, which is an extended and highly negatively
charged glycan, can directly bind to histone and this interaction
may be important for nervous system development and regener￾ation [46]. Pre-incubation of histones or NET with polysialic acid
considerably reduced both histone- and NET-mediated cytotox￾icity (Fig. 5B and C). These data indicate that the cytotoxicity of
NET is in great part mediated by histones.
Inhibition of neutrophil elastase does not inhibit the
cytotoxic effect of NET
Another abundant component of NET is neutrophil elastase [7].
To investigate the role of neutrophil elastase in NET-mediated
cytotoxicity, activity of elastase in NET was measured before or
after digestion. Increased activity of elastase in NET was observed
after digestion of DNA either by DNase or MNase (Fig. 6A), and
neutrophil elastase inhibitor significantly inhibited elastase activity
in NET, indicating that neutrophil elastase is active in NET and its
activity can be abolished by elastase inhibitor. However, using
elastase inhibitor, even at high concentrations, could not reduce
NET-mediated cytotoxicity in either digested or undigested NET
(Fig. 6B).
Inhibition of myeloperoxidase reduces NET-induced
cytotoxicity
One of the other granular components of NET is myeloperox￾idase (MPO) [5,7]. MPO has an important role in defense against
bacteria, viruses and fungi by conversion of hydrogen peroxidase
to hypochlorous acid. However, MPO activity can also induce
damage to adjacent tissue and, thus, contributes to the
pathogenesis of different inflammatory diseases including pulmo￾nary injury [47,48]. Pre-incubation of MPO inhibitor with
digested or non-digested NET led to reduction of NET-induced

cytotoxicity in epithelial cells (Fig. 7). These data indicate that the
cytoxicity of NET, besides histones, is partly mediated by MPO.
NET formation in lung tissue and BALF of LPS-induced
lung injury model
Under physiological conditions and in the absence of infectious
or inflammatory stimuli, there are less than one million
polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) in the lung tissue and no
PMN in the BALF [18]. To recruit PMN to the lung in
considerable number, LPS was instilled intratracheally into mice
to induce LPS-mediated acute lung injury [49–54]. NET
formation was observed in mouse lung tissue after LPS treatment
(as compared to the PBS controls), which was demonstrated by the
co-localization of extracellular chromatin with neutrophil elastase
(Fig. 8A) as well as the appearance of extracellular chromatin and
disintegration of cell membranes (Fig. 8B). In general, deconden￾sated chromatin in NET showed weak signal for DAPI staining,
while it was detected strongly by DNA/histone antibody. CD46
receptor, which was used as a cell membrane marker, is present on
all nucleated cells [55–57] and was used in this study to
demonstrate the release of chromatin from the cells since NET
formation requires the disintegration of the cell membrane.
However, the non-frequent NET detected structures and the
absence of long strands of chromatin in the tissue maybe due to
the presence of short fragments of DNA-protein complexes in the
airways, which is also confirmed recently by Douda and

NET-mediated cytotoxicity.

co-workers [58]. Several areas adjacent to NET structures showed
tissue destruction which may be due to the cytotoxic effect of
NET. Colocalizaion of myeloperoxidase with citrullinated histone
H3, which is one of the histone modifications during NET
formation [59], also indicated NET formation in lung tissue
(Fig. 8C).
Moreover, after 3 to 48 h of stimulation with LPS, BALF was
collected and the numbers of PMN were counted. Application of
LPS provoked maximal recruitment of neutrophils after 24 h
(Fig. 9A). Since treatment of NET with MNase leads to
dissociation of NET-DNA from NET-proteins, neutrophil elastase
activity in the BALF supernatant (free elastase) was compared to
the activity of elastase in the NET structure after digestion with
MNase (NET-related elastase). There was a significant increase in
NET-related elastase activity after 12 h stimulation in comparison
to the corresponding free elastase activity, indicating more NET
formation after this time period of stimulation (Fig. 9B).
Considerable increase in elastase activity in BALF after MNase
digestion is in accordance with the data of Fig. 6A, where isolated
NET showed increase in elastase activity after DNase or MNase
digestion.
To characterize NET formation in BALF, mouse neutrophils in
BALF after 24 h LPS stimulation were isolated with neutrophil￾specific marker Ly-6G antibody, and stained for chromatin and
cell membrane marker CD46. Since non-LPS stimulated neutro￾phils, as negative controls, could not be isolated from BALF [18],
stimulation with PMA was used as a positive control. Therefore,
some of these neutrophils were further stimulated with PMA, a
potent inducer of NET formation, for 1.5 h in vitro. While LPS,
which induces neutrophil recruitment, provoked NET formation
(which was shown by the release of extracellular chromatin,
disintegration of cell membrane as well as weak signal for DAPI) to
Figure 6. Inhibition of neutrophil elastase does not inhibit NET-induced cytotoxicity. (A) The supernatants of unstimulated (Unstim) or
stimulated (Stim) neutrophils (50 nM PMA for 4 h) were collected and analyzed for elastase activity in the absence (filled bars) or presence (open bars)
of neutrophil elastase inhibitor (NEI). Likewise, NET were isolated from stimulated cells and digested with DNase or MNase or kept undigested (2),
followed by analysis of elastase activity in the same way. (B) Cytotoxicity of A549 cells was measured after 16 h treatment with NET (DNase-digested)
in the absence or presence of NEI. Similar results were seen for MNase- or non-digested NET as well as with different NEI concentrations from 0.125 to
1 mM. Shown are representative data of three independent experiments (mean + SD), ***p,0.001 and ns = non-significant.

a certain extent, it was more pronounced in cells stimulated with
PMA (Fig. 9C). Together, these data demonstrate NET formation
in the BALF and lung tissue in LPS-induced lung injury model.
Discussion
Excessive NET formation or impairment of NET removal has
been reported to be linked to chronic inflammatory diseases such
as preeclampsia, small-vessel vasculitis and systemic lupus
erythematosus [26,28,29,31,60,61]. However, the direct influence
of NET and their components on host cells have not been
investigated. To verify that the cell destructive effect of
neutrophils is merely due to NET components and not to other
secreted components of neutrophils, the direct influence of
isolated NET on alveolar epithelial cells (as the major cells
responsible for gas exchange in the lung) as well as endothelial
cells was examined in this study. Here, NET-induced cytotoxicity
of epithelial and endothelial cells (whether primary or cell-line) in
a dose-dependent manner was noted. Interestingly, DNA￾digested NET (either completely digested or partially digested
NET) did not change NET-mediated cytotoxicity. Moreover,
boiled or denatured NET could not induce cytotoxicity which
may further indicate that mostly proteins in NET are involved in
NET-mediated cytotoxicity.
Bearing in mind that histones are the most abundant proteins of
NET with bactericidal and leishmanicidal activity [5,8], interfer￾ence with histones by antibodies, polyanionic compounds or
proteases should decrease NET-mediated cytotoxicity. Pre-treat￾ment of NET with antibodies against different histones could
decrease NET-mediated cytotoxicity to a varying degree; however,
this treatment was not effective for all kinds of histones. Specific
histone modification(s), unique structures of histones in complex

of chromatin decondensation). DAPI alone and DNA/histone alone were also shown for the insets 4, 5 and 6. In A and B, yellow arrows indicate some

citrullinated histone H3 which indicate NET formation.

with DNA and other proteins or histone degradation during NET
formation or the protein complexes in NET could be responsible
for such differences [7,59,62].
Using polyanionic compounds that mask or bind histones would
be an alternative approach to interfere with histone-mediated
cytotoxicity. Incubation of both isolated histones and NET with
polysialic acid, which has been recently described as a binding
partner for histone H1 [46], significantly reduced cytotoxicity. Yet,
specificity of these compounds needs to be further explored.
Moreover, histones can be degraded with different proteases
such as cytotoxic T lymphocyte protease granzyme A [63],
activated nuclear proteasome [64] or APC. APC is a serine
protease which plays an important role as natural anti-coagulant
and also has been reported to degrade histones in an isolated
system and thereby may reduce cell death in sepsis [45]. While our
data showed that APC significantly decreased histones-mediated
epithelial cytotoxicity in a purified system, incubation of NET
(either nuclease-digested or not) with APC could not reduce NET￾mediated cytotoxicity, although much higher concentrations of
APC were used for treatment with NET as in a purified system.
Analysis of NET compared to NET incubated with APC by SDS￾gel electrophoresis and the subsequent protein identification did
not show histone degradation after APC treatment (Fig. S2).
Similarly, 2-D DIGE did not reveal any difference in the protein
patterns between both samples. The observed protective effect
could be due to (a) formation of DNA-histone complexes, (b)

formation which is demonstrated by appearance of the extracellular chromatin, disintegration of the cell membranes as well as chromatin
decondensation. Shown are representative data of three independent experiments (mean + SD), ***p,0.001.

formation of complexes between histones and other proteins, (c)
specific histone modification in NET [7,59], (d) octamerization
and decreased accessibility of histones in NET or (e) partial
degradation of histones during NET formation [62]. The fact that
histone-induced cytotoxicity in NET cannot be reduced by APC
or completely abolished with histone antibodies still does not rule
out the importance of these proteins in cytotoxicity, since APC and
anti-histone antibodies may be the best option to decrease the
cytotoxicity of histones in a purified system but not in NET.
Another abundant protein component of NET is neutrophil
elastase [7], which has important roles in the clearance of invading
pathogens. Moreover, elastase is able to mediate neutrophil-induced
tissue damage and efficiently degrades extracellular matrix
components [65]. Neutrophil elastase in NET showed increased
activity after digestion of DNA. These data also support the
presence of NET in BALF after LPS induction, as increased elastase
activity was observed after DNA digestion. However, inhibition of
neutrophil elastase in different forms of digested NET did reduce
NET-mediated cytotoxicity. The presence of more cytotoxic
components of NET (such as histones) may explain this effect such
that inhibition of neutrophil elastase alone is not sufficient to
suppress NET-mediated cytotoxicity. Alternatively, elastase in NET
may induce cytotoxicity independent of its enzymatic activity; a
possible mechanism that requires further attention.
MPO, another granular protein with anti-microbial activity, was
also investigated for NET-mediated cytotoxicity in the present
study. MPO has an important role in defense against bacteria by
conversion of hydrogen peroxidase to hypochlorous acid. Never￾theless, MPO activity can also provoke damage to the adjacent
tissues; therefore, it may contribute to the pathogenesis of several
inflammatory diseases including pulmonary injury [47,48]. It has
been reported that MPO can provoke caspase-3 activation and
apoptosis in HL-60 human leukemia cells [66]. Moreover, MPO
can induce DNA strand breakage in lung epithelial cells [67]. Pre￾incubation of NET with MPO inhibitor moderately decreased
NET-mediated cytotoxicity of epithelial cells, indicating that MPO
may also contribute to the cell-damaging capacity of NET.
NET is composed of DNA and different types of proteins with
different sizes and cellular localization [7], and investigation of all
of these proteins on NET-mediated cytotoxicity was beyond the
scope of the present study. It should also be considered that
different procedures for NET collection or various techniques for
protein identification, such as gel-free mass spectrometry, may give
rise to different results. So far, a standard procedure for NET
collection, which truly confirms that the isolated NET contain all
the materials and structures comparable to the in vivo-formed
NET, has not been established. Therefore, it is essential to
mention the exact procedure of NET collection in studies dealing
with NET. Moreover, the diversity of NET proteins and their
incomplete identification make the recognition and analysis of the
cytotoxic parts of NET more complicated. Treatment of epithelial
cells with NET induced up-regulation of proteins with different
kinds of functions from regulation of cell cycle to glycolysis and
proteasome degradation pathway. Interestingly, several of these
proteins are known to be up-regulated during cell death and
apoptosis (Table S1) which further supported our data about
NET-mediated cytotoxicty.
NET structures and areas with tissue destruction adjacent to
NET were observed in the LPS-treated mice as well as in other
studies during influenza pneumonitis [68]. The absence of long
strands of chromatin in the tissue, which could be due to the
presence of short fragments of DNA-protein complexes in the
airways [58], may complicate the analysis of NET in lung tissue. It
is also worthwhile to consider that not only NET components but
also secretion of granular proteins can lead to tissue destruction.
During the preparation of the present study, Narasaraju and co￾workers showed that co-incubation of neutrophils with HUVEC
resulted in endothelial cell death [68]. However, in the present
study, epithelial and endothelial cells were incubated with isolated
NET and not with neutrophils to exclude the effect of other
components of neutrophils such as secreted enzymes and proteins
which are not bound to NET.
Lung epithelial cell death is not only observed in ALI but also in
other diseases such as cystic fibrosis. Progressive inflammation and
infection results in destruction of airways in the lungs of cystic
fibrosis patients, and patients’ lungs contain extracellular DNA
which accumulates in the airway due to the chronic bacterial
infection [21]. Using immunocytochemistry, we observed clear
structural similarity between isolated NET and the supernatant of
cystic fibrosis sputum where chromatin fibers were decorated with
granular proteins such as elastase (data not shown). This leads us
to propose that NET may be responsible for cytotoxic effects in the
broncho-alveolar space of cystic fibrosis patients. These observa￾tions were supported by a very recent study [69]. Although
aerosolic therapy with recombinant human DNase has been linked
with an improvement in airflow obstruction and a decrease in the
number of infectious respiratory exacerbations in some cystic
fibrosis patients, this is not true for all cases [70]. As reported in
this study, digestion of DNA in NET was not sufficient to abolish
NET cytotoxicity, and this could be one reason that DNase
therapy is not successful in all cystic fibrosis patients.
In this study, we tested the direct effect of NET on epithelial and
endothelial cells and found a case for histones in cytotoxicity. So
far, any study which estimates the exact amount of DNA-derived
NET in humans suffering from acute lung injury has not been
documented. Nevertheless, the DNA-NET concentrations used in
this study are in the range of DNA concentration in the sputum of
the cystic fibrosis patients [71] as well as plasma DNA
concentration of systemic lupus erythematosus patients [72].
Other studies also showed that the extracellular DNA in these
patients is predominantly derived from NET [29–31,69].
However, the in vivo situation is far more complex. Phagocy￾tosing cells remove dead cells and their debris (perhaps NET
components too). Furthermore, the ciliary motion in the lung
prevents the maintenance of dead cells in one place for a longer
period of time. It has to be further investigated whether one of the
reasons which promote lung destruction in patients with ALI or
cystic fibrosis is the impairment of NET removal mechanisms. In
addition to lung cells, NET showed cytotoxic effect on other cells,
such as HUVEC (also skin and neuronal cells, data not shown),
which may refer to the general cytotoxic capability of NET.
