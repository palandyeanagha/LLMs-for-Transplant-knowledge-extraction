Abstract
Background: No data exists about the gender differences among patients with infective endocarditis (IE) in Egypt.
The objective was to study possible gender differences in clinical profiles and outcomes of patients in the IE
registry of a tertiary care center over 11 years.
Results: The IE registry included 398 patients with a median age of 30 years (interquartile range, 15 years); 61.1%
were males. Males were significantly older than females. Malignancy and recent culprit procedures were more
common in females while chronic liver disease and intravenous drug abuse (IVDU) were more in males. IE on top
of structurally normal hearts was significantly more in males (25.6% vs 13.6%, p = 0.005) while rheumatic valvular
disease was more common in females (46.3% vs 29.9%, p = 0.001). There was no difference in the duration of
illness before presentation to our institution. The overall complication rate was high but significantly higher in
females. However, there were no significant differences in the major complications: mortality, fulminant sepsis, renal
failure requiring dialysis, heart failure class III–IV, or major cerebrovascular emboli.
Conclusion: In this registry, IE occurred predominantly in males. Females were significantly younger at
presentation. History of recent culprit procedures was more common in females while IVDU was more common in
males who had a higher incidence of IE on structurally normal hearts. The overall complication rate was higher in
women. IE management and its outcomes were similar in both genders.

Background
Gender differences and their impact on the clinical profile
and outcome in cardiovascular diseases are a debatable
issue in the literature [1–3]. These differences may be
attributed to a variety of factors including variable comor￾bidities, treatment biases, or inherent physiologic differ￾ences [3]. Previous reports addressing this issue in patients
with infective endocarditis (IE) did not examine its relation￾ship with outcomes and treatment decisions systematically
[2, 3]. IE occurs in males more frequently than females,
with 2:1 to 9:1 ratio [4–6]. Animal models suggested a
potential protective role for estrogen against endothelial
damage [7, 8], whereas human studies showed that females
less likely develop sepsis after traumatic hemorrhagic shock
[9–11], but the exact mechanism is not fully understood.
Moreover, females tend to encounter heart disease at an
older age than males. Thus, younger females are relatively
protected from IE predispositions. On the other hand, fe￾males have a higher incidence of comorbid conditions (e.g.,
diabetes mellitus (DM) and renal failure) which may com￾plicate IE management and result in worse outcomes [12].
In Egypt, no data exists about the gender differences
among patients with IE regarding clinical characteris￾tics or prognosis. Gender biases in offering diagnostic
and treatment services are alleged in rural and under￾privileged areas.

Methods
Patient cohort
An IE specialized unit and registry were established in
February 2005 in a tertiary care facility in Egypt to de￾fine the clinical profile of IE patients and improve the
awareness and management of this disease entity. The
registry details were previously published [13], including
definitions of terms used (prosthetic valve endocarditis
(PVE), intravenous drug use (IVDU)-associated IE and
healthcare-associated endocarditis (HAE)), the microbio￾logic data (blood cultures, serologic tests, surgical speci￾men cultures, and histopathologic examination), and
follow-up during the hospital course. The current study
involves all patients with possible/definite IE [14] be￾tween February 2005 and September 2016. Transtho￾racic echocardiography (TTE) was performed within 24–
48 h of hospital admission followed by trans-esophageal
echocardiography (TEE) within another 72 h if there was
a clinical indication [13]. All patients received the appro￾priate management protocols as recommended by the
current guidelines [15–21]. Patient education on IE
prophylaxis, dental care, and symptoms and signs of IE
recurrence was provided upon discharge. In addition to
regular patient care, the dedicated IE team organized
regular meetings and seminars, distributed brochures
about proper IE diagnosis and management, and ar￾ranged infection control workshops on proper blood and
tissue sampling techniques. Besides, regular internal and
external audit meetings were held to monitor the pro￾gress of the IE registry [13].
Statistical analysis
Data analysis was performed by SPSS 20.0 program. Cat￾egorical data were expressed as percentages. Continuous
variables were skewed and presented as median and
interquartile range (IQR). Differences in categorical vari￾ables were tested by the chi-squared test or Fisher’s
exact (when appropriate). The comparison of continuous
variables was done using the Mann-Whitney test.
Gender-specific significant univariate variables for in￾hospital mortality (with p < 1.0) entered a stepwise con￾ditional multivariate regression analysis to detect the
most significant independent predictors with the corre￾sponding odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval
(CI). Statistical significance was considered at p < 0.05.
Results
Clinical characteristics
The patient cohort included 398 patients; median age,
30 years (IQR, 24–39 years), 61.1% were males. The main
clinical features and comorbidities are demonstrated in
Table 1. Males were significantly older than females.
Malignancy and recent culprit procedures were more
common in females while chronic liver disease and
IVDU were more in males. There was a trend for higher
HAE in females. However, the various culprit procedures
did not differ between both genders (intravenous lines,
early PVE, dialysis, non-cardiac surgeries, dental proce￾dures, or urinary catheter insertions). IE on top of struc￾turally normal hearts was significantly more prevalent in
males while rheumatic heart disease (RHD) was more
common in females. The duration of illness before pres￾entation to our institution was very long and did not
differ between both genders.
Echocardiographic findings
The main echocardiographic features are represented in

in females, whereas right-sided vegetation (namely the
tricuspid valve) was more common in males.
Microbiologic data
The rate of negative blood cultures was equally high in
males and females (69.5% vs 68.4%, p = 0.8), and there
were no gender differences in the rate of organism de￾tection using different methods (surgical specimen cul￾ture and histology). The most common detected
organisms were staphylococcal species (28.8% vs 21.3%,
p = 0.1). There were no gender differences in all other
detected organisms (streptococci, enterococci, gram￾negative bacilli, fungi, or zoonotic organisms). Empirical
antibiotics were also equally given in both genders
(59.3% vs 55.5%, p = 0.5).
Complications
The overall complication rate was high, but it was sig￾nificantly higher in females. However, the major compli￾cations (fulminant sepsis, renal failure requiring dialysis,
advanced heart failure, major cerebrovascular stroke,
and in-hospital mortality) were similar between both
genders. Surgery was equally performed when clinically
indicated (Figs. 1 and 2)
Predictors of in-hospital mortality in both genders
Univariate predictors of in-hospital mortality are pre￾sented in Table 3. Using multivariate analysis, the
most important predictors of in-hospital mortality in
males were poor response to antibiotics (OR, 57.0; CI,
12.7–269.1, p < 0.001), fulminant sepsis (OR, 10.8;
95% CI, 1.2–98.2; p = 0.034), and not performing
surgery when indicated (OR, 8.9; 95% CI, 3.5–23.0; p
< 0.001). In females, poor response to antibiotics was
the sole predictor of in-hospital mortality (OR, 15.1;
95% CI, 1.5–161.0; p = 0.022).
Discussion
This is a subgroup analysis of an IE registry in a tertiary
care facility for 11 years in which we studied the main
differences in IE features and management between both
genders. The main registry report and subgroup reports
were previously published [13, 22–28]. Differences in of￾fering diagnostic and therapeutic healthcare services
based on gender have been a major worldwide con￾cern over the years [29–32]. In this analysis, there
were no gender differences in the management and
outcome of IE patients. The response to antibiotic
treatment, the need for surgical treatment, the rate of
surgical interventions, and overall in-hospital mortal￾ity were similar in both genders. Previous IE studies
showed worse outcomes among females [1, 33, 34],
because of less surgical interventions in the active
phase of the disease [34] or comorbid conditions that
put females at a higher risk [1, 3].
Comorbid conditions like DM and renal insufficiency
were not different between both genders. However,
males suffered more from liver diseases, while females
had a higher incidence of malignancy. This contrasts
with a previous study [3] which showed a higher preva￾lence of DM, renal insufficiency, and immunosuppres￾sion among females that was translated into a worse
outcome. Another study [1] also showed that renal in￾sufficiency and immunosuppression were more common
in females.
We previously reported a high rate of overall compli￾cations (39.4%) [13]. A striking feature was the signifi￾cantly higher rate among females that can be attributed
to the trend of higher rates of HAE which translates to
highly resistant strains. Fortunately, the major life￾threatening complications (advanced heart failure, ful￾minant sepsis, renal failure, major cerebrovascular em￾boli, and in-hospital mortality) did not differ between
both genders. This is in contrast to a previous study [3]
that showed a twofold higher rate of in-hospital mortal￾ity among females, explained by the presence of more
comorbid conditions. The same study and another one
[34] also showed a higher rate of surgical interventions
among males. In our registry, the rate of performing

surgery when indicated, the use of antibiotics, and the
overall outcome were similar between both genders.
This confirms the absence of gender-bias in offering
medical services in our facility.
In our registry, IE occurred more commonly in males
(61.1%) with a ratio of 1.6:1. This gender predilection for
IE was previously reported in Saudi Arabia [35], United
Kingdom (UK) [36], Japan [37], and other reports [4–6].
There are theories about a potential protective role for
estrogen against endothelial damage [7, 8] and a less
likelihood of developing sepsis in females [9–11], but the
exact mechanism is not fully understood.
In this analysis, a history of recent culprit procedures
was more common in females, who also had a trend to
encounter HAE and a higher incidence of RHD. They
are more exposed to health care procedures (concerned
with birth control, pregnancy, and labor), which puts
them at a higher risk for developing HAE, at a young
age, especially when predisposed with high rates of
RHD. This may explain the younger age of females with
IE in this registry. On the other hand, males had a
higher incidence of IE on structurally normal hearts,
likely because of a higher incidence of IVDU among
them, which can affect normal hearts.
This analysis revealed a very high rate of culture￾negative IE (69.1%) that was equal in both genders. This
may be explained by the indiscriminate use of antibiotics
for the treatment of any febrile illness before obtaining
blood cultures (58%). This is a common practice in our
country, and it applies to both genders. This rate was
also high in African countries like Algeria (56.4%) [38]
and South Africa (55.3%) [39] compared to European
countries like the UK (12.2%) [40] and France (9%) [41].
Right-sided valves (namely the tricuspid valve) were
more commonly involved among males due to a
higher incidence of IVDU. On the other hand, mitral
valve involvement (detected by TTE) was more com￾mon in females, while aortic valve involvement and
the development of aortic ring abscess were more
common in males. This finding was previously shown
in a study by Hamda et al. [42] and may be explained
by the higher rate of mitral disease in females and
aortic disease in males [43].
This analysis identified several issues that can be ad￾dressed to improve IE management. Medical personnel
education about infection control measures and timely
management of the various febrile illnesses can be trans￾lated into lower rates of HAE, culture-negative IE, and

complications leading to better IE outcomes. Increasing
the awareness of the health hazards of IVDU may also
decrease the IE infection rates among males.
Conclusion
In this registry, IE occurred predominantly in males. Fe￾males were significantly younger at presentation. History
of recent culprit procedures was more common in females
while IVDU was more common in males who had a
higher incidence of IE on structurally normal hearts. The
overall complication rate was higher in women. IE man￾agement and its outcomes were similar in both genders.
