Our data about pathogenesis of hepatic steatosis after liver transplantation is scarce. This study 
aimed to investigate the association between serum adipokines and insulin resistance with hepatic 
steatosis in liver transplant recipients. We investigated the association between insulin resistance, 
serum adiponectin, insulin, and leptin with hepatic steatosis in a cohort of liver transplant recipients. 
Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance 2 (HOMA 2-IR) was used for estimation of 
insulin resistance. Hepatic steatosis was determined using ultrasound and controlled attenuation 
parameter (CAP). A total of 178 patients were included. 79 patients (44.4%) had hepatic steatosis. 
Serum adiponectin (OR: 0.912; 95% CI 0.869–0.957; P< 0.001), serum leptin (OR: 1.060; 95% CI 
1.017–1.102; P= 0.005), HOMA2-IR (OR: 1.671; 95% CI 1.049–2.662; P= 0.031), and post-transplant 
diabetes mellitus (PTDM) (OR: 5.988; 95% CI 1.680–21.276; P= 0.006) were independently associated 
with hepatic steatosis after liver transplantation. CAP values were negatively correlated with serum 
adiponectin (P= 0.011) and positively correlated with serum insulin (P= 0.001), leptin (P< 0.001) and 
HOMA2-IR (P< 0.001). Insulin resistance and alterations in adipokines might have central role in 
pathogenesis of hepatic steatosis after liver transplantation and can be targeted for diagnostic and 
therapeutic purposes.

NAFLD Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
NASH Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is rapidly surpassing other indications of liver transplantation during 
recent years and is going to become the leading cause of liver transplantation worldwide1
. This is mainly due to 
the increasing prevalence of NAFLD secondary to the epidemics of metabolic syndrome and obesity2
. NAFLD is 
not only an increasing cause of liver transplantation but also might occur after transplantation as recurrence of 
the disease or de novo hepatic steatosis3
. The prevalence of hepatic steatosis after liver transplantation has been 
ranged from 30–60% in different studies4,5
.
While pathogenesis of NAFLD and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has been thoroughly investigated in 
recent years6,7
, our data regarding pathogenesis of post-transplant hepatic steatosis is limited. Several risk factors

for hepatic steatosis after liver transplantation have been hypothesized. Post-transplant metabolic syndrome 
and obesity is prevalent after liver transplantation promoting the process of hepatic steatosis8
. Weight gain is 
occurred in the majority of patients after liver transplantation irrespective of the underlying cause of cirrhosis 
and is probably one of the main contributing factors for hepatic steatosis after liver transplantation9,10. Hyper￾lipidemia, post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) and hypertension are traditional risk factors for fatty liver 
disease that might occur after liver transplantation11,12. Insulin resistance has a central role in the pathogenesis of 
NAFLD. Insulin resistance is involved in progression of NAFLD by increasing release of free fatty acids from the 
adipose tissue and de novo lipogenesis within hepatocytes secondary to hyperinsulinemia13,14. Insulin resistance 
can also cause flux of free fatty acids from adipocytes in to the liver14. Serum adipokines including adiponectin 
and leptin have been reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Serum leptin level is increased and 
serum adiponectin is decreased in patients with NAFLD in parallel to the severity of disease15.
To date, only few data are available about association of post-transplant hepatic steatosis with serum adi￾pokines and insulin resistance as the main mechanisms of hepatic steatosis. In this study we aimed to investigate 
the impact of insulin resistance and serum adipokines on post-transplant hepatic steatosis.
Results
Association of hepatic steatosis with serum adipokines and insulin resistance after liver trans‑
plantation. 178 liver transplant recipients were included in the study. There were 99 men (55.6%) and 79 
women (44.4%). Baseline characteristics of patients are outlined in Table 1. The meantime for evaluation of fatty 
change after liver transplantation and blood sampling was 38.83±34.43 months. Using ultrasound, 79 patients 
(44.4%) were diagnosed to have hepatic steatosis after liver transplantation. Twenty eight patients (35%) had grade 
1 steatosis, 29 patients (36.7%) had grade 2 steatosis and 22 patients were diagnosed to have grade 3 steatosis in 
ultrasound. CAP values were statistically different between patients without steatosis (189.95±51.88 dB/m), with 
grade 1 stetaosis (229.52±65.40 dB/m), and with grade 2 stetaosis (275.20±39.87 dB/m) (P<0.001) in ultra￾sound (Fig. 1). Univariate analysis of risk factors for hepatic steatosis after liver transplantation are outlined in 
Table 2. Mean serum concentration of adiponectin after liver transplantation was 13.30±10.59 µg/ml in patients 
with steatosis compared to 24.91±17.42 µg/ml in patients without steatosis (P<0.001). Serum concentration 
of leptin (20.64±22.02  ng/ml versus 9.97±11.97  ng/ml) and insulin (15.81±17.73 µU/ml versus 8.80±7.07 
µU/ml) were significantly higher in patients with hepatic steatosis compared to those without hepatic steatosis 
(P<0.001). In regression analysis, serum adiponectin (OR: 0.912; 95% CI 0.869-0.957; P<0.001), serum leptin 
(OR: 1.060; 95% CI 1.017–1.102; P=0.005), HOMA2-IR as a marker of insulin resistance (OR: 1.671; 95% CI 
1.049–2.662; P=0.031), and PTDM (OR: 5.988; 95% CI 1.680–21.276; P=0.006), were independently associated 
with hepatic steatosis after liver transplantation (Table 2).
Serum adiponectin level was statistically different over different grades of steatosis in ultrasound (F (2, 
166) = 7.052, P = 0.001). Serum adiponectin level was significantly lower in patients with grade 2 steato￾sis (8.89 ± 6.52 µg/ml) and grade 1 steatosis (15.97 ±12.72 µg/ml) compared to the patients without steatosis 
(23.48±17.37 µg/ml). Serum leptin level was statistically different over different grades of steatosis in ultrasound 
(F (2, 166) = 8.698, P < 0.001). Serum leptin level was significantly higher in patients with grade 2 steatosis

Liver fat contents measured by CAP are associated with serum adipokines and insulin resist‑
ance. CAP was measured in 172 patients. Mean CAP values in our patients was 208.19±61.64 dB/m. The 
correlation of CAP with serum adiponectin, insulin, leptin, HOMA2-IR and other metabolic indices are outlined 
in Table 3. Using Pearson correlation test, CAP was negatively correlated with serum adiponectin (P=0.011) 
and positively correlated with serum insulin (P=0.001), leptin (P<0.001) and HOMA2-IR (P<0.001) (Fig. 3). 
Serum tacrolimus level was not correlated with CAP values (r=−0.102, P=0.253). CAP was also positively

analysis, serum adiponectin, leptin, HOMA-IR and serum triglyceride were independently associated with CAP 
(Table 3).
The association between serum adipokines and hepatic steatosis diagnosed by TE is outlined in Fig. 4.

Hepatic steatosis in lean patients after liver transplantation and the impact of low serum 
adiponectin. Ninety two patients (53.5%) were lean (BMI<25 kg/m2
). Among lean subjects, 20 patients 
(22.2%) had hepatic steatosis (11.2% of all the study population). In univariate analysis, post-transplant hyper￾lipidemia (odds ratio=3.47: 95% CI 1.092–11.030; P-Value=0.029), PTDM (odds ratio=4.23: 95% CI 1.480–
12.128; P-Value=0.005), and low serum adiponectin level (P=0.045) were associated with hepatic steatosis in 
lean liver transplant recipients (Table 4). In regression analysis, PTDM (odds ratio=1.05: 95% CI 0.078–1.333; 
P-Value=0.014), and low serum adiponectin level (odds ratio=0.94: 95% CI 0.902–0.996; P-Value=0.032) were 
independently associated with hepatic steatosis among lean liver transplant recipients (Table 4).
Discussion
Our results demonstrate that hepatic steatosis diagnosed by ultrasound and TE in liver transplant recipients is 
associated with decreased serum adiponectin and increased serum leptin and insulin levels. Liver transplant 
recipients with hepatic steatosis had higher insulin resistance as assessed by HOMA2-IR. PTDM was also an 
independent predictor of hepatic steatosis after liver transplantation. We used CAP for non-invasive estimation 
of liver fat content. CAP values were different over different grades of hepatic steatosis in ultrasound and was 
correlated negatively with serum adiponectin and positively with serum leptin and HOMA2-IR. After adjustment 
for age, gender, BMI and other metabolic indices, serum adipokines and insulin resistance were independently 
associated with hepatic steatosis after liver transplantation highlighting their role in pathogenesis of hepatic 
steatosis after liver transplantation. In a subgroup of lean patients, decreased serum adiponectin level was an 
independent predictor of hepatic steatois after liver transplantation.
Recurrent or de novo hepatic steatosis after liver transplantation has been reported to be associated with 
PTDM, higher BMI and other components of metabolic syndrome16–18. However, limited data is available about 
pathogenesis of hepatic steatosis after liver transplantation. Increased fasting hepatic gluconeogenesis and impair￾ment of suppression of hepatic glucose production are two components of hepatic insulin resistance19. Diacylg￾lycerol (DAG) and ceramide have been suggested to be the two major lipids involved in hepatic insulin resistance 
via activation of protein kinase and downstream impairment of hepatic insulin signaling20. Total hepatic DAG 
and ceramide have been correlated with HOMA-IR as a marker of insulin resistance21,22. It is well known that 
insulin resistance is strongly associated with hepatic steatosis23. In a population based cohort, HOMA- IR was 
closely associated with liver fat contents assessed by magnetic resonance spectropscopy24. However, the role of 
insulin resistance in the development of hepatic steatosis after liver transplantation is controversial.
In contrast to our findings, Andrade and colleagues reported that HOMA-IR, as a marker of insulin resist￾ance, was not a predictor of NAFLD after liver transplantation25. In this study, we used HOMA2-IR (the updated 
HOMA model) that is a better indicator of hepatic insulin resistance as it accounts for variations in both periph￾eral and hepatic glucose output26. Insulin resistance is prevalent among patients undergoing liver transplantation 
for hepatitis C virus (HCV) cirrhosis27 and other causes of liver cirrhosis28. A cross-sectional study showed that

insulin resistance is highly prevalent and associated with new onset diabetes after liver transplantation29. None 
of these studies reported the impact of insulin resistance on the development of hepatic steatosis after liver 
transplantation.
Leptin and adiponectin are two major adipokines that are produced and secreted mainly from adipocytes and 
are involved in the pathogenesis of hepatic steatosis15. Leptin acts in liver cells via activation of the Janus kinase 
(JAK) 2/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3 pathway resulting in increased expression of 
suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-3 which is a feedback inhibitor of leptin signaling30. It has been shown 
that inhibition of SOCS-3 improves leptin resistance and hepatic steatosis31. A meta-analysis of 33 studies has 
shown that serum leptin level was higher in patients with simple steatosis and NASH compared to the healthy 
controls32. Adiponectin is decreased when adipose tissue mass increases and has anti-steatotic properties on 
hepatocytes. Adiponectin promotes oxidation of free fatty acids, inhibits gluconeogenesis and prevents apopto￾sis of hepatocytes. It has also anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory effects by acting on Kupffer cells and hepatic 
satellite cells33–35.
Alterations of serum adipokines after liver transplantation have been reported previously in few studies, 
none of them focused on hepatic steatosis. Watt et al. reported that increased serum leptin and decreased serum 
adiponectin levels were seen in liver recipients with cardiovascular events36. A recent study reported that hypoadi￾ponectinemia was an independent predictor of future cardiovascular events in liver transplant recipients37. 
However, a cross-sectional study among a small group of patients failed to demonstrate any correlation between 
serum adipokines and metabolic syndrome after liver transplantation38. In a previous study no association was 
demonstrated between hepatic steatosis and serum leptin after liver transplantation39. In the mentioned study, 
authors only included patients with HCV infection and did not evaluate the impact of serum adiponectin. It has 
been recently suggested that patients with NAFLD and adiponectin gene polymorphisms were susceptible to 
hepatic steatosis after liver transplantation40.
In this study, we showed, for the first time, that alterations in serum adiponectin and leptin as well as insulin 
resistance were correlated with hepatic steatosis and hepatic fat contents in liver transplant recipients independ￾ent of traditional risk factors of hepatic steatosis. We used ultrasound and CAP for non-invasive estimation of 
hepatic steatosis. CAP is a non-invasive, cheap and easy technique (compared to other methods) for quantita￾tive measurement of liver fat content during transient elastography41,42. This parameter has been increasingly 
measured in patients with NAFLD43 and suggested to have good efficacy for assessment of hepatic steatosis after 
liver transplantation44.
Finally, cumulative evidence suggests that hepatic steatosis is prevalent after liver transplantation, however, 
its long term impact on allograft and patient outcomes is less evident. Our study expands current knowledge 
about pathophysiology of hepatic steatosis after liver transplantation. Liver transplant recipients with insulin 
resistance and alterations in adiponectin and leptin are susceptible to hepatic steatosis and should be actively 
diagnosed and treated. Targeting insulin resistance and adipokines can be considered as therapeutic options for 
prevention and management of hepatic steatosis after liver transplantation.
Methods and materials
Patients. In a cross-sectional study, all adult (>18 years) liver transplant recipients who referred for their 
routine post-transplant follow-up between July 2017 and November 2017 were included in the study. All patients 
had undergone liver transplantation from deceased donors at Shiraz Organ Transplant Center, Shiraz, Iran. We 
included patients who have passed at least 6 months after transplant surgery. Tacrolimus based immunosuppres￾sive regimen was used for the maintenance of immunosuppression after liver transplantation for all patients. 
Patients with acute rejection episodes and those with serum aminotransferase levels higher than 5 times upper 
limit of normal range were excluded from the study. Clinical characteristics of patients were recorded at the time 
of study inclusion. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated using this formula: weight (kg) divided by height 
(m2
) squared. Patients with BMI<25 kg/m2
 were defined to be lean. Hepatic steatosis in transplant recipients 
was assessed by ultrasound and classified as grades 0, 1, 2, and 3 based on the severity of liver echogenicity as a 
marker of severity of hepatic steatosis.
Measurement of serum adiponectin, leptin and insulin. Peripheral venous blood samples were col￾lected from patients in the morning after an overnight fasting. Blood samples were centrifuged immediately at 
4 °C and separated serum samples were stored at −80 °C. Serum adiponectin levels were measured by enzyme 
linked immunoassay (ELISA) method using human adiponectin ELISA kit (Mediagnost, Reutlingen, Germany). 
Serum insulin levels were measured by ELISA method using human insulin kit (Monobind Inc., Lake Forest, CA 
(92630), USA). Serum leptin levels were measured using human leptin ELISA kit (Mediagnost, Reutlingen, Ger￾many). Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) is a method for assessment of insulin 
resistance and β-cell function based on the fasting plasma insulin and glucose concentrations. Insulin resistance 
was estimated using HOMA 2-IR software, as described before45. Blood sampling was performed on the day of 
clinical visit and assessment of hepatic steatosis by ultrasound and CAP measurement.
Measurement of controlled attenuation parameter (CAP). Non-invasive estimation of hepatic fat 
content was measured for all patients using vibration‐controlled transient elastography (VCTE) and expressed as 
CAP. Measurement of CAP was done on the day of clinical visit and blood sampling and after an overnight fast￾ing. All CAP measurements was done by one person. CAP was obtained along the inter-axillary line and inter￾costal spaces on the liver while the patient was in supine position. CAP measurement was considered to be reli￾able if 10 valid successful acquisitions were made correctly. TE was performed using M probe in all patients and 
XL probe was used in obese patients in whom use of M probe was failed. CAP measurement was expressed in

decibel per meter (dB/m)46. The cutoff scores for CAP estimation of hepatic steatosis were as follows:≥238 dB/m 
for S1 (corresponding to 11–32% liver fat),≥259 dB/m for S2 (33–65% liver fat), and≥292 dB/m for S3 (≥66% 
liver fat), as previously determined.
Statistical analysis. Continuous and categorical variables were compared using Student’s t-test and Chi￾square test, respectively. Data were presented using means±standard deviation for numeric variables, and per￾cents and counts for categorical variables. A one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post-hoc Tukey test 
were used to compare serum levels of adiponectin, leptin and insulin with different grades of hepatic steatosis. 
Logistic regression analysis was used to identify the independent variables and association of serum adipokines 
and insulin resistance with hepatic steatosis after liver transplantation. Pearson’s and Spearman’s correlation 
coefficients were used to assess correlation of serum adipokines and insulin resistance with CAP values after 
liver transplantation. Linear regression analysis was used to identify continuous variables independently asso￾ciated with CAP values. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 20.0 (SPSS Inc.; Chicago, IL, USA). A P￾value of<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Ethics and consent. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of Organ Trans￾plant Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences on 5/11/2016. The study protocol was performed in accord￾ance with the Helsinki Declaration as revised in Seoul 2008. Written informed consents were obtained from each 
patient after explaining the study harms and benefits.
