Abstract
Background: Classical organic acidurias including methylmalonic aciduria (MMA), propionic aciduria (PA)
and isovaleric aciduria (IVA) are severe inborn errors of the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids and
odd-numbered chain fatty acids, presenting with severe complications.
Methods: This study investigated the long-term outcome of 80 patients with classical organic aciduria
(38 with MMA, 24 with PA and 18 with IVA) by integrating clinical, radiological, biochemical and genetic data.
Results: Patients were followed-up for a mean of 14 years [age 3.3-46.3 years]. PA included a greater number of
patients with abnormal neurological examination (37% in PA, 24% in MMA and 0% in IVA), lower psychometric
scores (abnormal evaluation at age 3 years in 61% of patients with PA versus 26% in MMA and 18% in IVA) and
more frequent basal ganglia lesions (56% of patients versus 36% in MMA and 17% in IVA). All patients with IVA
presented a normal neurological examination and only 1/3 presented cognitive troubles. Prognosis for MMA was
intermediate. Biochemical metabolite analysis excluding acute decompensations revealed significant progressive
increases of glycine, alanine and glutamine particularly in PA and possibly in MMA but no correlation with neurological
outcome. A significant increase of plasma methylmalonic acid was found in MMA patients with intellectual deficiency
(mean level of 199 μmol/L versus 70 μmol/L, p < 0.05), with an estimated significant probability of severe outcome for
average levels between birth and age 6 years above 167 μmol/L. Urinary 3-hydroxypropionate (3-HP) levels were
significantly higher in PA patients with intellectual deficiency (mean level of 68.9 μmol/mmol of creatinine versus
34.6 μmol/mmol of creatinine, p < 0.01), with an estimated significant probability of severe outcome for average levels
between birth and age 6 years above 55 μmol/mmol. As for molecular analysis, prognosis of MMA patients with
mutations involving the MMAA gene was better compared to patients with mutations involving the MUT gene.
Conclusion: Propionic aciduria had the most severe neurological prognosis. Our radiological and biochemical data are
consistent with a mitochondrial toxicity mechanism. Follow-up plasma MMA and urinary 3-HP levels may have
prognostic significance calling for greater efforts to optimize long-term management in these patients.

Background
The classical organic acidurias are branched-chain amino
acids disorders involving intermediate metabolism.
Depending on the enzymatic block, three major organic
acidurias have long been distinguished: isovaleric aciduria
(IVA) designates an isovaleryl-coA deshydrogenase defect
on the leucine degradation pathway secondary to mutation
in the IVD gene, propionic aciduria (PA) results from a
defect in propionyl-coA carboxylase encoded by the PCCA
or PCCB genes, and methylmalonic aciduria (MMA)
is caused by mutations in the MUT gene, encoding
the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MCM), or more rarely in
genes encoding the coenzyme adenosylcobalamin of MCM.
MCM converts methylmalonyl-CoA into succinyl-CoA, an
intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the major
source of NADH used by the mitochondrial respiratory
chain. Two of these diseases, PA and MMA, affect
the pathway common to valine, isoleucine, methionine
and threonine metabolism.
Organic acidurias (OA) usually present as acute metabolic
distress at birth with coma associated with dehydration
when the enzymatic deficiency is complete, or later in life
with recurrent ketoacidotic episodes, psychomotor retard￾ation and chronic vomiting when the deficiency is partial
[1,2]. As propionate is produced by the catabolism of
branched-chain amino acids, fatty acids with a carbon
odd-chain and the intestinal flora, the treatment is
based on a strict low-protein diet associated with sufficient
caloric intake, carnitine and antibiotics. However, despite
therapeutic improvements over the last 20 years, overall
outcome of patients with OA remains unsatisfying. Reports
are increasing of long-term complications, such as
neurological disorders by degeneration of the basal
ganglia, progressive renal failure in MMA, cardiomyopathy
in PA and acute pancreatitis in all [3-5].
Specific changes in the levels of urinary and plasma
metabolites are the hallmark of the classical forms of
the diseases including ketoacidosis, hyperlactatemia,
hyperamoniemia, cytopenia in variable proportions. In
urine, several organic acids are quite specific for diagnosis,
particularly 3-hydroxypropionate and methylcitrate in PA,
methylmalonate in MMA and isovalerylglycine in IVA.
Enzymatic and genetic analyses confirm the diagnosis.
The pathophysiology of these disorders is not clearly
understood and the proposed mechanisms are complex.
Metabolite accumulation upstream of the enzymatic block
triggers a systemic endogenous intoxication. Furthermore,
the metabolic pathway involved in classical organic
acidurias contributes to acetyl-coA and succinyl-coA
formation, which are required for the tricarboxylic
acid cycle. Thus, there is an energetic deficit by mitochon￾drial dysfunction secondary to substrate insufficiency
and specific toxic metabolite accumulation including
3-hydroxypropionate [1].
The long-term neurological prognosis of these disorders
depends on the severity of the disease, the delay of diagno￾sis and probably specific biochemical and genetic parame￾ters. In particular, several studies attempting the delay to
describe the neurological evolution of organic acidurias
were hampered by the wide phenotypic variability even in a
homogenous genetic population [6]. In order to better de￾lineate the long-term neurological outcome of patients with
organic acidurias, we analyzed clinical, radiological, bioche￾mical and genetic parameters of a large cohort of patients.
Methods
Patient cohort
Inclusion criteria was a positive biochemical diagnosis
of propionic, methylmalonic or isovaleric aciduria in a
cohort of patients followed up at Necker-Enfants Malades
hospital from 1991 to 2012 and managed with similar
chemical and diet therapy. Exclusion criteria were an age
less than 3 years old at the time of study, death before age
3 years or insufficient clinical data.
Neonatal onset refers to patients diagnosed within
the first month. “Late onset” patients were all those
diagnosed thereafter.
Neurological evaluation
Neurological evaluation was based on retrospective
clinical data available in medical reports and was
completed by radiological data (brain scanner and
magnetic resonance imaging).
Psychometric evaluation
Each patient’s psychometric evaluation was supported by
school data and psychometric tests depending on the
age of the patient and the evaluation year (Brunet Lezine
from 0 to 2 ½ years old, Brunet Lezine with complementary
test from 2 to 6 years old, WPPSI-III from 3 to 7 years old,
NEMI from 4 to 12 years old and WISC-R and WISC-IV
from 6 to 17 years old). Heterogeneity of the tests made it
impossible to carry out a precise comparative study, thus
we distinguished four distinct clinical groups based
on developmental or intellectual quotient and autonomy
level: group 0 with IQ > 85 or DQ > 90 in normal school,
group 1 with IQ = 71-85 or DQ = 76-90 in normal school
with specialized assistance for children in difficulties,
group 2 with IQ = 51-70 or DQ = 56-75 in specialized
classroom within normal school presenting mild intellec￾tual deficiency and group 3 with IQ ≤ 50 or DQ ≤ 55 in
specialized establishment presenting moderate to severe
intellectual deficiency.
Neurological evaluation was performed at 1, 3, 6, 11
and 18 years old leading to the definition of four groups
in term of cognitive evolution: group A with autonomy
and good evolution (group 0 or 1 maintained from age 1
to 18 years), group B with improvement of psychometric

evaluation over time (transition from initial classification
into group 2–3 to classification into group 0–1), group C
with worsening of psychometric evaluation (from group
0–1 to group 2–3) and group D with poor outcome from
the outset and absence of autonomy.
Acute decompensations
Five different clinical conditions of variable severity were
defined and reported on different periods from 0 to 3,
from 3 to 6, from 6 to 11 and from 11 to 18 years old: 1)
conditions at risk of acute decompensation needing an
emergency diet at home; 2) conditions at risk of acute
decompensation needing hospitalization for emergency
diet by naso-gastric tube or intravenously without bio￾logical findings; 3) clinical and biological decompensa￾tion including pH < 7.30, bicarbonatemia < 18 mmol/L,
ammoniemia > 70 μmol/L or neurological trouble, 4)
severe acute decompensation with intensive care and 5)
severe acute decompensation with haemofiltration.
Biochemical analysis
Standard biochemical blood analysis included ammoniemia,
lactate, amino acids (with particular emphasis on glycine,
alanine, glutamine) and propionylcarnitine during basal
state and acute decompensation, as well as pH, bi￾carbonatemia during acute decompensation. Specific
metabolites included urinary 3-hydroxypropionate,
propionylglycine, tiglyglycine and methylcitrate for PA,
plasma and urinary methylmalonate for MMA and
urinary isovalerylglycine for IVA. Amino acids were assayed
by ninhydrin colorimetry (Jeol Aminotac Analyzers) and
organic acids by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry
(Varian Saturn-2000).
Genetic analysis
Organic acidurias are recessive autosomal genetic diseases.
Mutations in the PCCA (Propionyl CoA Carboxylase, alpha
subunit, GenBank:NG_008768) and PCCB (Propionyl
CoA Carboxylase, beta subunit, GenBank:NG_008939)
genes for PA, MUT (Methylmalonyl CaA mutase,
GenBank:NG_007100), MMAA (Methylmalonic Acidemia,
cblA type Gene, GenBank:NG_007536) and MMAB
(Methylmalonic Acidemia, cblB type Gene, GenBank:
NG_007096) genes for MMA and IVD (Isovaleryl Coa
dehydrogenase, GenBank:NG_011986) for IVA were
identified after PCR amplification of patient’s DNA and
dideoxynucleotide sequencing using the BigDye terminator
cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,
USA) and analysis with ABI Prism 3100 DNA sequencer.
Statistical analysis
The statistical analysis consisted in comparison of means
by the two-tailed Student test with significance accepted
for p < 0.05. Comparisons involving more than two groups
were performed with one-way ANOVA followed by the
Tukey's post-hoc test or two-way ANOVA. Logistic
regression was performed with the bayesglm module in R.
Results
Demographic analysis of the cohort of patients
The cohort included 80 patients from 74 families, 46 boys
and 34 girls, born after 1990 and being alive after age
3 years, including 24 PA, 38 MMA and 18 IVA. Clinical
follow-up of the cohort is shown in Figure 1. Mean age was
14 years and the median was 12.3 years [3.3-46.3 years old].
58% of patients have been diagnosed during the first month
(median current age, 11.4 years old). 42% of patients had a
presentation from 1 month to 18 years old (median current
age, 13.2 years old). Metabolic dysfunction led to liver
transplantation for one PA patient and kidney transplan￾tation for two MMA patients. Concerning MMA patients,
only two sibling patients were sensitive to B12 supplemen￾tation. Thus, no correlation could be established with this
series. Finally, one patient with PA died at 19 years old of
an accidental fall, one with MMA died at 17 years old of a
gastrointestinal bleeding after hernia surgery, and two
patients with MMA died following an acute metabolic
episode at 11 and 7 years old respectively.
Clinical neurological and psychometric evaluation
Clinical neurological examination was considered
normal in 63% of PA (median age of 13 years old
[3.8-46.3 years old]), 76% of MMA (median age of
10.9 years old [3.3-33.4 years old]) and 100% of IVA
(median age of 11.9 years old [3.4-25.3 years old])
(p < 0.01 between IVA and MMA or PA, see Figure 2).
Among the 18 patients with abnormal neurological
examination, 33% had a pyramidal syndrome, 44% had an
extrapyramidal syndrome, 33% a cerebellar syndrome and
28% of the patients required assistance to walk (44% for
PA, 11% for MMA and none for IVA).
Moreover, seven patients were found with psychiatric
disorders. Among PA, two teenagers presented with a
psychotic disorder with hallucinations and disorganized
behavior that was triggered by a moderate metabolic
decompensation and was controlled by antipsychotic
treatment within a few months. Such therapy may need
to be adapted in case of cardiomyopathy or long QT
syndrome. A third PA patient had a depressive and
sleep disorder and one had an anxiety disorder.
Among MMA, two patients had behavioral disorder
and one patient had a personality disorder with anxiety.
Most of these patients were treated by psychotherapy and
by conventional drugs. Among PA, one patient followed
up to 46 years old had memory trouble with ictus amnesic
episodes. 6 to 21% of patients had attention trouble and 8
to 33% of patients had fine motor trouble disturbing
handwriting and requiring rehabilitation.

Psychometric evaluation at different times highlighted
a specific pattern attendant on the type of organic
aciduria (Figures 3 and 4). The score was considered as
normal (groups 0 and 1) in 39% and 47% of patients
with PA at ages 3 and 11 years respectively, in 74% and
50% of patients with MMA at ages 3 and 11 years
respectively, and 82% and 67% of patients with IVA at
ages 3 and 11 years respectively. Interestingly, at age
11 years, group 0 included only a few patients: 4/20 for
MMA, 1/9 for IVA and 0/17 for PA. By contrast, at this
age, 29% of PA (12/17), 25% of MMA (15/20) and
11% of IVA (1/9) had deficiency in expression and
comprehension skills.
PA patients were neurologically more severely affected
than MMA and IVA at 3 years of age, with 61% of PA
patients in group 2 or 3 compared to 26% for MMA and
18% for IVA (p < 0.01 between PA and MMA or IVA,
ANOVA test). The outcome was good for only 12% of
patients with PA comparing to 50% MMA patients and
67% IVA patients (group A). Of note, the data indicated

patients, 11.9 years.

psychometric improvement in 35% of PA patients from
group B and not in other organic aciduria. Then, at
11 years old, groups A/B and C/D proportion was about
the same among the three organic acidurias with a better
prognosis for IVA. Furthermore, cognitive regression
concerned 20 to 29% patients for all three organic
acidurias (group C at 11).
Correlation between age of onset and neurological
examination
Neurological examination was normal for 87% of patients
with neonatal diagnosis and for 66% of patients diagnosed
later (p < 0.05, see Figure 5). Both groups had pyramidal
syndrome, cerebellar syndrome, psychiatric troubles,
attention deficiency or fine motor troubles in insignificant
different proportions. Only late onset diagnosis patients
had an extrapyramidal syndrome, with frequent difficulty
to walk: 3/4 PA and 1/4 MMA required assistance to walk.
Correlation between date of onset and neurological data
Between 1991 and 2000, the neonatal resuscitation
was less effective than after year 2000 and nocturnal
nutrition by nasogastric tube was not systematic at
that time contrary to current recommendations.
Therefore, we reanalyzed data in two subgroups, de￾pending on whether diagnosis was done before or
after 2000. A fraction of 48% of the patients was
diagnosed before 2000 with similar proportions among
the different organic acidurias. Neurological examination
was normal for 68% of patients who were diagnosed
between 1991 and 2000 (50% of PA, 68% of MMA,
100% of IVA) and for 86% of patients diagnosed after year
2000 (75% of PA, 84% of MMA, 100% of IVA, p = 0.07,
not significant). Psychometric tests showed no significant
difference between the two groups: IQ was normal at
6 years old for 50% of patients diagnosed between
1991 and 2000 and 71% of patients diagnosed after
2000 (p = 0.08, not significant). Therefore, there was a
non-significant trend toward better neurological scores
(neurological examination and psychometric tests) for
patients diagnosed after 2000, consistent with improved
management.
Brain imaging evaluation
Imaging was available for 50/80 patients including 16/24
PA, 28/38 MMA and 6/18 IVA. Brain MRI was normal
for 19% of PA, 46% of MMA and 33% of IVA when
Figure 3 PA, MMA and IVA patients repartition according to psychometric tests at different ages (normal 0–1, intellectual
deficiency 2–3).

aciduria from 3 to 11 years old (A normal, B improvement,

available (see Figure 6). Abnormalities included basal
ganglia lesions for 56% of PA, 36% of MMA and 17% of
IVA, notably involving the striatum and the globus
pallidum, white matter anomalies for 38 to 50% and
cerebellar anomalies for three MMA and one IVA. For
five patients, normalization of basal ganglia lesions and
white matter anomalies were observed at a distance from
the acute episode. Furthermore, two patients PA and
three patients MMA had increased lactate concentration
in basal ganglia. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy was
not performed for the other patients.
Brain imaging and neurological examination correlation
Among 62 patients with normal neurological examination,
30 patients had available brain imaging: the pictures were
normal for 47% of patients, and showed white matter
anomalies for 40%, basal ganglia anomalies for 17% and
cerebellar abnormalities for 10%.
Among the six patients with pyramidal syndrome, two
had normal brain MRI, three had basal ganglia anomalies,
two had white matter anomalies and one cerebellar
atrophy. Among the seven patients with extra-pyramidal
syndrome, two had a normal brain MRI, four had basal
ganglia anomalies and two had white matter anomalies.
Of the four patients with cerebellar syndrome, two had a
normal MRI and two had white matter anomalies. There
was no correlation between long-term psychometric test
evolution and brain anomalies.
Acute decompensations
Excluding initial decompensation, PA patients underwent
an average of 1.8 acute decompensations from birth to age
three years [0–8] whereas IVA patients had only 0.5 [0–2]
and MMA patients 1.2 [0–7] (see Figure 7); the difference
between PA and IVA was significant (p < 0.05; we did
not count the initial decompensation). For the three

organic acidurias, we found two frequency peaks of
decompensations, from birth to three years old and
from eleven to eighteen years old. Furthermore, the
number of patients requiring haemofiltration for one
of the acute decompensations including the initial epi￾sode was 6/24 for PA (two patients required two and three
haemofiltrations respectively), 7/38 MMA and 1/8 IVA.
Except for one of the seven MMA patients, haemofiltration
was performed only at the first decompensation.
Biochemical profile outside of acute decompensations
Plasma amino acid levels differed significantly with disease
status and age, showing a highly significant interaction for
glycine (p = 0.0001; Table 1A). Indeed compared to MMA
and IVA, the pattern of variation of glycine was strikingly
specific to PA, showing a sharp increase at an early age and
a high plateau at about 11 years (Additional file 1, Figure 8).
In addition, the two other tested amino acids, glutamine
and alanine, showed highly significant increases with age
specifically in PA, whereas variations were essentially
borderline in MMA, and undetectable or not progressive
with age in IVA (Figure 8 and Table 1B). There was no
correlation between plasma glycine, glutamine and alanine
levels and the neurological, psychometric evolution and
brain anomalies for any age group.
Organic acid levels average over the first six years was
significantly associated with neurological prognosis for
MMA and PA. Indeed, plasma methylmalonic acid was
70 μmol/L for MMA group A/B and 199 μmol/L for
MMA group C/D (p < 0.05). By logistic regression, the
odds ratio for severe outcome (groups C/D rather than
A/B) was 4.3 (95% confidence interval: 1.1-16.3) for
every two-fold multiplicative increase of average plasma
MMA levels over the first 6 years, and the risk of
severe outcome was significant for values greater than
or equal to 167 μmol/L (probability: 0.67; 95% confidence
interval: 0.51-0.84).
As for urinary 3-hydroxypropionate, the average
level over the first 6 years was 34.6 μmol/mmol of
creatinine for PA group A/B and 68.9 μmol/mmol of
creatinine for PA group C/D (p < 0.01). Odds ratio for
severe outcome was 5.1 for every two-fold multiplicative
increase of urinary 3-hydroxypropionic acid levels averaged
over the first 6 years. The risk of severe outcome was
significant for values greater than or equal to 55 μmol/L
(probability: 0.64; 95% confidence interval: 0.51-0.77)
Other metabolites were not correlated with clinical
evolution, notably urinary isovalerylglycine for IVA
(1556 μmol/mmol of creatinine), plasma propionylcarnitine
level for MMA (45.4 μmol/L), lactatemia (2 mmol/L) and
ammoniemia (54 μmol/L) for PA, MMA and IVA.
Genetic analysis
The genotype was known for 49/80 patients (see Table 2).
Two PA patients had mutation in PCCA (one stop, one
missense and one splice mutations) and seven in PCCB
(five stop and five missense mutations), eight MMA
patients had mutation in MMAA (seven stop and one
missense mutations), one in MMAB (stop mutation) and
29 in MUT (nine stop and sixteen missense mutations
including two recurrent mutations p.Ala191Glu for 19%
and p.Asn219Tyr for 13%) and five IVA patients had
mutation in IVD (four missense mutations).
For PA patients, there was no correlation between
genotype and neurological evolution, especially between
patients with two stop mutations and those with two
missense mutations. The number of patients was not
sufficient for any in-depth investigation.
For MMA patients, cognitive prognosis and neurological
evolution were significantly better at age 6 or 11 years, for
MMAA mutated patients compared to patients with
mutation in MUT. Indeed, 7/8 MMAA mutated patients
and 9/26 MUT mutated patients were classified in the
group A (p < 0.05, Fisher's exact test) while 1/8 MMAA

mutated patients and 7/26 MUT mutated patients had
abnormal neurological examination. Furthermore, cogni￾tive evolution at 6 or 11 years old seemed to be better for
patients with mutation in MUT with two missense muta￾tions (7/12 in group A) compared to those with two stop
mutations (four patients in group C or D). However
there was quite heterogenous neurological prognosis
for patients with the same mutation.
We found no genotype phenotype correlation in IVA
patients.
Discussion
This study investigates the long-term neurological prog￾nosis of 80 patients presenting with classical organic
acidurias, i.e. PA, MMA and IVA that involve the
branched-chain amino acids metabolism. The results
reinforce the notion that PA patients have the most se￾vere neurological prognosis with 37% of patients with
abnormal neurological examination, 61% with abnormal
cognitive test at age three years and 56% with basal
ganglia lesions. PA patients also presented more
frequent acute decompensations from zero to three
years old (1.8 on average). Four patients had psychiatric
troubles including delirious syndrome during an acute
decompensation. However, long-term cognitive evaluation
was similar to MMA because of an improvement of psy￾chometric tests with 47% of PA patients achieving normal
evaluation at 11, which was not paralleled by MMA pa￾tients. Recently, Grünert et al. [5] reported a cohort of 55
PA patients with intellectual deficiency in 75% of patients
(median IQ at 55), hypotonia in 51% of patients and ataxia
in 9% of patients. Brain MRI revealed basal ganglia lesions
in 5/26 patients [5]. We note that our data correspond to a
psychometric evaluation performed at age 11 years. Most
patients reported by Grünert et al. were younger (median
age: 5.2 years [5]), which may explain why they did not
(yet!) show the cognitive improvement that we have ob￾served on average. Nevertheless in some of our patients,
evolution rather involved a progressive neurological
worsening.
IVA had the best neurological prognosis with normal
neurological examination in all patients, though white
matter anomalies were noted in 3 patients of 6 available
MRI. However, fine motor trouble was detected in 22%
of patients, as well as some degree of intellectual
deficiency in one third of IVA patients. Our data comple￾ment a study realized on 16 IVA patients including 44%
with coordination trouble or moderate motor trouble

and 16% with intellectual deficiency [2]. In literature,
neurological prognosis was good for 85% of IVA patients
diagnosed during neonatal period while only for 45% of
the patients diagnosed later. Eventually, some acute
decompensations occurred during teenage years.
MMA had an intermediate prognosis between PA and
IVA with 24% of abnormal neurological examination,
54% of brain anomalies and 50% of intellectual deficiency
at 11 years old.
Identification of prognostic factors would be useful to
prevent neurological complications and to guide long-term
follow up. Early diagnosed patients had better neurological
prognosis as neurological examination was normal for 87%
of patients diagnosed during neonatal period but only 66%
of those diagnosed later (p < 0.05), as previously described
in several studies, arguing in favor of neonatal screening for
organic acidurias [7-9]. Most forms being revealed at a few
post-natal days of life, neonatal screening will be effective
for later onset forms. In this cohort, all patients with an
extra-pyramidal syndrome were diagnosed after the neo￾natal period. By contrast, the number of acute decompensa￾tions and their severity did not influence the prognosis.
Similarly, there is no correlation between brain anomalies
and abnormal neurological examination or intellectual defi￾ciency. Likewise, liver transplants for PA and MMA and
kidney or combined liver-kidney transplant for MMA
improve the metabolic status. Benefits are shown in term of
significant improvement of quality of life with increased
protein tolerance, reduction of acute decompensations and
hospitalizations. However transplantation does not cure the
disease. Metabolic decompensations are less common but
remain possible and long-term complications, in particular
neurological impairment, are not prevented [10]. This
suggests that additional prognostic factors are involved,
notably the degree of metabolite balance in the basal state.
Considering standard metabolites, there was no correlation
between the biochemical profile excluding the acute
decompensations and neurological outcome. However,
we found significant progressive increases of the three
plasma amino acids tested in PA and not in IVA, with an
intermediate pattern in MMA (Table 1 and Figure 8).
Because the deviating plasma amino acid pattern progresses
with age, it might result from unsatisfactory management
during follow-up rather than at diagnosis. This may
be relevant to the finding that intellectual ability in
our PA cohort is better at 11 years than reported at
an earlier age in another cohort (see above) [5]. Thus,
greater efforts may be needed to optimize long-term
management in these patients.
Considering patients with MMA, plasma methylmalonic
acid levels were higher in patients with intellectual
deficiency, with an “alert” value estimated at 167 μmol/L.
In the same way, urinary 3-hydroxypropionate level was
higher in patients with intellectual deficiency, with an
“alert” value of 55 μmol/mmol of creatinine. Finally, geno￾type analysis was not informative for prognosis. As for PA,
there was no genotype phenotype correlation presumably
because of the small number of patients. Previous studies
reported that the phenotype was more severe among pa￾tients with two stop mutations or with missense muta￾tions altering protein stability, especially those involving
PCCB [11,12]. As for MMA, global neurological prognosis
was better for patients with mutations in MMAA gene
compared to those mutated in MUT gene even if most
mutations in MMAA were stop mutations. These results
can be explained by the role of the protein coded by
MMAA in synthesis of adenosylcobalamin, the cofactor of
methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, and its occasional sensitivity
to B12 supplementation. Consistent data have already
been presented in previous studies [13,14]. As for IVA,
molecular data were available for only five patients and
there was no obvious genotype phenotype correlation. A
previous study on a cohort of patients presenting with the
same homozygous missense mutations showed great
phenotypic variability [6].
Finally, clinical and biochemical differences observed
between the three organic acidurias highlighted some
differences of pathophysiological relevance. The best
prognosis was associated with IVA, possibly because of a
great efficacy of glycine to detoxicate accumulated metabo￾lites. Furthermore, leucine degradation leads to acetyl-CoA
and not succinyl-CoA formation contrary to PA and MMA,

making the energy defect possibly less pronounced in
IVA. This is also suggested by the absence of basal ganglia
lesions and the normal lactate peak on magnetic
resonance spectroscopy. An in vitro study on rat cortex
synapses showed that IVA metabolites do not modify
tricarboxylic cycle and respiratory chain activity but
inhibits Na+
,K+
-ATPase, an enzyme playing a role in
brain development and neuronal stability [15]. Pheno￾typic variability observed in a homogenous population
suggests that other environmental or genetic factors mo￾dify isovaleryl-CoA deshydrogenase activity or the effi￾ciency of glycino-conjugation [6]. Other metabolites, such
as isovalerylglutamate, methylfumarate, isovalerylserine
and 3-hydroxycaproate have recently been detected and
could play a role in pathophysiology [16]. By contrast,
PA generates several toxic metabolites such as 3-
hydroxypropionate, methylcitrate, and propionyl-CoA.
We have shown that urinary 3-hydroxypropionate level
correlates with long term neurologic outcome con￾sistent with previous hypotheses based on propionate
toxicity on glial cell metabolism [17]. Propionyl-CoA
and methylcitrate are responsible for mitochondrial
dysfunction by enzyme inhibition and propionyl-CoA
decreases acetyl-coA formation by CoA sequestration
[18,19]. These features may account for the severity of
PA deficiency that frequently leads to basal ganglia
lesions, high lactate peak on magnetic resonance spec￾troscopy and significant increase of plasma alanine level.
Furthermore, increased plasma glycine is more pro￾nounced in PA patients thus also arguing for an impor￾tant dysfunction of the glycine cleavage system in
mitochondria. In MMA, methylmalonic acid levels also
correlated with long-term neurological outcome. Other
metabolites such as 3-hydroxypropionate, methylcitrate,
tiglyglycine and propionylgycine were present in much
smaller amounts compared to PA. The intermediate
prognosis of MMA suggests that toxicity may mainly re￾sult from intermediate levels of PA metabolites. Indeed,
it has been demonstrated that methylmalonate has no
obvious toxicity on respiratory chain [20], yet secon￾dary respiratory chain deficiency has been reported in
PA and MMA patients in different tissues [21,22].
Conclusion
In conclusion, this study of 80 patients with organic
acidurias brings additional knowledge on long-term
neurological outcome and highlights the need to identify
relevant environmental or genetic prognostic factors that
may modulate severity of the disorders. We have identi￾fied prognostic “alert” values for the two more severe
deficiencies, MMA and PA. Our clinical, radiological and
biochemical data strengthen the hypothesis of a mecha￾nism of direct mitochondrial toxicity for PA and to a
smaller degree, for MMA.
