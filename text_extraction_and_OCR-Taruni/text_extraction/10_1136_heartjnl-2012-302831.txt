ABSTRACT
Objective To evaluate the scale and clinical
importance of loss to follow-up of past patients with
serious congenital heart disease, using a common
malformation as an example. To better understand the
antecedents of loss to specialist follow-up and patients’
attitudes to returning.
Design Cohort study using NHS number functionality.
Content and thematic analysis of telephone interviews of
subset contacted after loss to follow-up.
Patients, intervention and setting Longitudinal
follow-up of complete consecutive list of all 1085 UK
patients with repair of tetralogy of Fallot from single
institution 1964–2009.
Main outcome measures Survival, freedom from late
pulmonary valve replacement, loss to specialist follow￾up, shortfall in late surgical revisions related to loss to
follow-up. Patients’ narrative about loss to follow-up.
Results 216 (24%) of patients known to be currently
alive appear not to be registered with specialist clinics;
some are seen in general cardiology clinics. Their median
age is 32 years and median duration of loss to follow-up
is 22 years; most had been lost before Adult Congenital
services had been consolidated in their present form.
48% of the late deaths to date have occurred in patients
not under specialist follow-up. None of those lost to
specialist follow-up has had secondary pulmonary valve
replacement while 188 patients under specialist care
have. Patients lost to specialist follow-up who were
contacted by telephone had no knowledge of its
availability.
Conclusions Loss to specialist follow-up, typically
originating many years ago, impacts patient
management.
INTRODUCTION
Open heart surgery for congenital heart disease
began in the 1960s in the UK. Its progressive
success has meant that since around 2002, adult
survivors of surgery outnumber children with con￾genital heart disease in the UK.1 2 The same docu￾ment estimated that there are around 130 500
adults with ‘moderate’ or ‘complex’ congenital
heart disease alive in England and Wales today;
almost all are survivors of surgery they had as
young children. For many complex congenital
heart diseases, residual haemodynamic problems
can result in late heart failure, reduced exercise cap￾acity, arrhythmias or sudden death and there are
risks associated with pregnancy and non-cardiac
surgery.3 Most premature deaths associated with
congenital heart disease are now occurring in
adults rather than children.
Tetralogy of Fallot is the commonest ‘cyanotic’
congenital heart disease. Palliative surgery for this
malformation became available in the UK in the
late 1950s,4 and intracardiac repairs in the early
1960s. Without surgery, only 4% of children born
with tetralogy of Fallot would be alive at 15 years.5
The intracardiac repair is generally successful in
closing the ventricular septal defect but most
patients are left with an element of pulmonary
obstruction or incompetence. Timely reintervention
with insertion of a ‘pulmonary’ valve in the right
ventricular outflow tract may help to prevent or
delay late complications. While the exact indica￾tions for reintervention are not yet entirely clear,
recommendations for pulmonary valve replacement
(PVR) may be made on the basis of physiological
parameters even if a patient has few symptoms.6
For patients after Fallot repair, current guidelines
stipulate that patients be periodically reviewed by
specialists accredited in Adult Congenital Heart
Disease (ACHD) in designated centres, though
shared-care networks allow for delivery of some
care by cardiologists with competencies in
ACHD.1 2 However, ACHD provisions have been
consolidated in their present form for less than
15 years and not all patients who left childhood
services before this period have found their way to
these services.
In this study, we aimed to use tetralogy of Fallot
with its requirement for lifelong surveillance and
possible adult reoperation to explore the implica￾tions of loss to follow-up of congenital heart
disease. For a well-defined cohort, we aimed to
establish the proportion of living patients not being
followed to the specified standard and to estimate
the impact of any shortfall in follow-up coverage
on the incidence of secondary reoperations. We
also wanted to conduct telephone interviews with
patients believed to be lost to follow-up to under￾stand their views on follow-up.
METHODS
We created a complete consecutive list of patients
who had repair of uncomplicated tetralogy of
Fallot at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH)
from the very first repair performed in February
1964 to January 2009; patients receiving an extra￾cardiac conduit at their primary repair were
excluded as this commits them to subsequent
surgery. Patients from abroad were excluded as we
have no control of their follow-up. The list was

generated using several sources: the manually written surgical
lists (patients operated in the 1960s and 1970s), scanned oper￾ation notes (patients from the 1970s and 1980s), and from
various electronic databases used since then. Archived medical
records were checked and early postoperative deaths and the
dates of any childhood PVRs were determined. Current patients
have National Health Service (NHS) numbers recorded within
their childhood records, but this is not true for patients lost
before these came into existence in 1996. Using the known
dates of birth and childhood surnames, NHS numbers were
linked to the patient records using batch tracing functions and
manual searches. At around the age of 16, patients are currently
discharged to the care of their nearest ACHD service; this
process is systematic at present but historically it was much
more variable. Given a list of NHS numbers and current names,
addresses and dates of birth, collaborating specialist cardiologists
from the Adult Congenital heart disease Research Network
scanned their local databases for the listed patients to ascertain
whether they had died under their care or were under active
review or had been previously seen but then ‘lost’; if they had
undergone PVR they established the date of PVR when this had
first occurred beyond childhood. Where the specialist centres,
patients’ families or the NHS core record alerted us to a late
death, the date of death was documented. Patients were deemed
‘lost to specialist follow-up’ if they had not been seen within
any specialist network in the past 3 years. Patients known to
have relocated abroad or whose NHS numbers we could not
establish were censored on the date last seen alive. Because PVR
is only undertaken in specialist centres, live patients who had
corresponding NHS numbers but were lost to specialist
follow-up were assumed not to have had PVR.
Telephone interviews
The General Practitioners (GPs) of patients who had repaired
tetralogy of Fallot at GOSH and were believed not to be under
specialist follow-up were contacted to confirm that we had iden￾tified the correct patient. On receiving confirmation, patients
were sent an explanatory letter asking them to contact us if they
were prepared to receive a telephone call.
Patients were contacted by telephone at a time convenient to
them. The telephone interview was semistructured and extensive
notes (mostly verbatim quotes) were taken contemporaneously
by the researcher ( JW). Questions were asked concerning parti￾cipants’ current state of health and any interactions with health
professionals, their recollection of any advice they had been
given regarding their heart condition, use of support groups,
knowledge about their condition, health experiences since the
time of their surgery, attitudes to and experiences of follow-up
and knowledge about current recommendations regarding
follow-up of adult patients with congenital heart disease.
Though it was made clear that the study did not aim to influ￾ence their follow-up arrangements, if participants subsequently
wanted follow-up with specialist ACHD providers we contacted
their GPs to request this.
Statistical analysis
Life table methodology,7 was employed to determine the cumu￾lative incidence of PVR in surviving patients. To illustrate the
impact of loss to follow-up on rates of PVR over time, two
curves were generated. The first included all patients known
from the NHS record to be alive, regardless of follow-up status
and provides the ‘actual’ proportions over time. The second
included patients only while they were actually under specialist
care, the ‘lost’ patients being censored on the date last seen by a
specialist centre, usually GOSH. SPSS V.18 was used.
Qualitative analysis
The first stage of the analysis of the telephone conversations
involved familiarisation with the data by reading and re-reading
the notes and quotes. Thematic analysis was used to generate
initial codes from each interview and to identify themes across
the dataset.8 Content analysis was used to determine the current
arrangements for follow-up, access to support and requests for
further information and/or referral to specialist ACHD services.
The project was approved by Research Ethics Committees
within the National Research Ethics Service (NRES).
RESULTS
From February 1964 to January 2009, 1085 UK patients (58%
males) had repair of Fallot at GOSH, at a mean age of 3·5
±3·6 years. Of 1085, we have either known dates of death or
NHS numbers and hence mortality status in all but 27. Most of
the 27 who have not been matched to their NHS numbers are
adult women and a further 17 patients are known to have relo￾cated abroad. 148 are known to have died to date. 100 died
within 1 year of repair (24 of 106 patients (23%) operated on
in the 1960s, and 6 of 246 (2%) operated in the 2000s). Of the
subsequent deaths, 23/48 (48%) appear not to have occurred
while the patient was under specialist care, so any attribution of
causes of late death for this cohort is unreliable.
Of the 893 known to be alive and living in the UK, 216
(24%) appear not to have been seen in specialist centres includ￾ing our own for more than 3 years (figure 1). The total of 216
includes 22 young people who have been lost from our own
clinics for more than 3 years, while 194 are not attending
ACHD clinics. The median current age of ‘lost’ patients is
32 years and median duration of loss to follow-up is 22 years.
A first PVR has been performed to date in 188 patients at a
mean age of 20±13 years, all necessarily in patients under spe￾cialist care. Figure 2 shows the cumulative proportion of live
patients who have had PVR. Under the untested assumption
that patients lost to follow-up lie in the same spectrum of
primary anatomy and of incompleteness of surgical repair as
those under active follow-up, the difference between these
curves suggests that an additional 63 PVRs would have
occurred, had the patients been followed by specialists.
Telephone interviews
Letters were sent to 176 GPs and as a consequence letters invit￾ing a telephone call were sent to 100 patients; in six cases we
were asked not to contact patients. One patient had been incor￾rectly tracked. Forty-two patients/carers of patients agreed to be
contacted but five were not available. The 37 patients contacted
by telephone included 23 (59%) males with a median age
current age of 44 years (range 9–57 years) and a median time
since surgery of 37 years (range 8–47 years).
Participants varied in terms of their current follow-up
arrangements and in their requirements for changes to these
arrangements (table 1). The majority of patients commented
that ‘they knew what they wanted to’ about their condition,
although few had had any contact with support groups or
accessed information about their condition. A number of partici￾pants had not known how to access further support or informa￾tion, as the following quote illustrates: ‘I looked at the internet
when I got your letter—I could spell tetralogy of Fallot then
and look it up’.

Themes from the qualitative analysis
Two main themes concerning attendance for follow-up emerged
from the interviews: perceived responsibility and reassurance.
Patients saw responsibility for maintaining follow-up as primar￾ily the duty of health professionals (box 1) or participants saw it
as their responsibility (box 2); within each of these there were a
number of subthemes. Reassurance was described by many
participants—those receiving and not receiving follow-up—as
the main benefit of follow-up (box 3).
DISCUSSION
This paper illustrates the clinical impact of loss to follow-up,
often originating many years ago and before ACHD services
were consolidated in their current form. Data from our cohort
suggests that 38% of Fallot patients known to be alive and over
the age of 30 are not being seen by ACHD specialist cardiolo￾gists and 48% of the late deaths recorded have occurred while
not under such follow-up. Related to this there is a shortfall that
is less easy to quantify in the incidence of late PVR, an oper￾ation typically undertaken as an investment for a patient’s later
quality of life.
This exercise, which is among the most comprehensive
outcome studies to date,9 has been made possible by three
resources: an early investment by one centre in maintaining good
paper and electronic lists over decades, the functionality offered
by the NHS number which has its own linkage to death certifica￾tion data and the collaboration offered by specialists in the field
of ACHD. Though individual specialist centres can document the
number of patients each follows, the denominator—the total
number of adult survivors of childhood operations including
those who are not under follow-up—has not been available. The
extent of loss to follow-up was explored in a somewhat

are censored on the date last seen alive by a specialist hospital.

comparable study from Canada.10 This documented that of 643
patients born in 1983 and who had survived childhood with con￾genital heart disease, only 39% were receiving specialist
follow-up after their 22nd birthday. Even among the most severe
group, only 79% were periodically reviewed by specialists.
Like most repairs for congenital heart disease, Fallot surgery
is not fully corrective with chronic pulmonary regurgitation
being the most prevalent residual problem. Chronic pulmonary
regurgitation is very well tolerated for many years, so a decision
to discharge early patients from follow-up may have seemed rea￾sonable. The exact physiological indications for PVR are not yet
clear, but symptoms emerge almost imperceptibly in patients
whose impairment is longstanding; objectively measured exer￾cise capacity can be very poor in patients with good self￾estimated capability.11 In principle, pulmonary regurgitation can
be alleviated by insertion of a new pulmonary valve. Currently
first pulmonary valve implants must be done surgically but the
potential of percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation for
Fallot survivors is encouraging. If PVR is to be done, ideally it
will be undertaken electively when the patient is of adult size, as
available valves do not grow with the patient. Leaving the oper￾ation too late prejudices right ventricular recovery and increases
postoperative morbidity.6 Though transition to adult specialist
services is more consistent in current practice, patients lost to
follow-up before ACHD services emerged may not present
again until late symptoms of cardiac decompensation occur.
Loss to specialist follow-up clearly has implications for the
‘lost’ patients themselves. We note that 23 patients were not
known to specialist services at the time of their deaths. As only
3% of deaths in the general population occur in the age group
15–44,12 we can infer that some of these deaths are likely to
have related to their cardiac status and these deaths have not
contributed to our understanding of this ‘new’ disease. Similarly
we estimate that there is a significant shortfall in late PVRs
related to loss to follow-up.
But in the context of ‘new diseases’ that emerge in the wake
of evolving technologies, loss to follow-up also has implications
for actively monitored patients and the doctors managing them.
For instance, exact indications for PVR are not currently
Box 2 Perceived responsibility: self
Participants identified that their own behaviours and beliefs
contributed to attending follow-up.
Leading a normal life and Fallot not part of that
“I moved around a lot—went to uni—never bothered to keep it
connected”.
“In one way I am glad that I had 10 years of blissful ignorance
—I didn’t see myself as damaged or in need of care”.
Responsibility to others
“An extra check is better for me and helps others... You have a
responsibility to people who have put you right”.
“I now go for follow-up because of my partner and wanting to
have a family”.
Anxiety—can prevent or facilitate accessing follow-up care
“The hospital may have sent appointments and I didn’t keep
them. I am worried [about being followed-up]”.
“I want to know what my heart is actually doing—am I fine? I
want to know if there is anything wrong…. Why would you
not go—it is your health. Things can change when you are
older. Follow-up is really important—I would not miss it”.
“I don’t need follow-up—it is not my bag. What would they
do? I hate needles….”
Ambivalence
“I don’t think it did me any favours because I had to put on a
form for an HGV license that I had been to the hospital and
now I get hassle [because of it]. I wouldn’t do it again—but
they do keep an eye on me”.
“If I had had to go back for follow-up it might have put
questions in my mind….”
Denial
“I looked up a bit recently about TOF but ….. I want to pretend
there is nothing wrong”
“I never think about it! I know that there are no guarantees in
life—but that is with everything. I feel fine! I feel there is no
need for follow-up”
“It was something that happened, it was sorted and I moved
on”.
“I am happy with how things are. I don’t want any specialist
follow-up”.
Awareness
“I have never had any concerns. Your letter was the first time I
had thought about it but there is no reason why I would not
want follow-up”.
“Now that I am aware I might well reconsider it”.
Box 1 Perceived responsibility—health professionals
The input from professionals was discussed as an explanation
for not attending for follow-up:
Perceived lack of interest or guidance
“I am not being followed-up because no-one has ever
bothered….. Follow-up was never suggested before”.
“It has never been up to me before—I have never not wanted
to see someone but no-one told me”.
“Follow-up is important but it is not taken seriously enough by
some GPs”.
Being led to believe follow-up was not necessary—they were
“cured”
“I don’t see anyone—I was signed off—that was it. I was told I
would be fine"
“I was led to believe that it was all fixed”.
“If it had been impressed on me that something could go
wrong I would have made sure I had check-ups. Accurate
perceptions are important“.
“I assumed everything was OK because we didn’t hear”.
Box 3 Reassurance as the main benefit of follow-up
Participants talked about the reassurance that follow-up could/
does provide
“It would be good to be seen by a specialist-reassuring”.
“Follow-up helps, gives you confidence—they will spot anything
that might be there”.
“After all this time I expect to carry on as normal but with the
reassurance of check-ups”.
“I look forward to being checked out and I recommend that the
system doesn’t leave it so long to get in contact with its
patients”.

established,6 but decision-making is inevitably only informed by
the population under active follow-up. If the ‘lost’ patients were
in a better clinical state than those seen in clinics, we might have
a more optimistic view of the natural history of pulmonary
regurgitation and delay surgery. If they were ‘worse’, we might
bring forward recommendations for reoperation.
The telephone interviews have provided some insight into
why patients have been lost to follow-up. It is evident that some
patients not currently under follow-up want to be seen by spe￾cialist services but do not know how to access such services; the
process of conducting the interviews has re-introduced half of
those we spoke to who were not in specialist follow-up back
into the system. Older patients in particular may have misper￾ceptions about the need for follow-up and a lack of knowledge
about potential problems that may arise.13
Anxiety and ambivalence may be keeping other patients out
of follow-up. Others have identified the importance of normal￾ising the clinical experience for adult patients with CHD while
avoiding overmedicalising them.14 The importance of reassur￾ance was a theme across all participant groups, irrespective of
their follow-up arrangements, and ensuring that patients are
aware of the benefits of regular check-ups as well as the poten￾tial problems which may arise. In the past decade, the responsi￾bility of paediatric services to ensure continuity of care through
transitioning to adult services has been operationalised, but
patients also need to be empowered by those in the paediatric
centre to share long-term responsibility for their own health and
follow-up. As one participant said, ‘Follow-up is like an MOT
on a car; it takes one afternoon and if there is anything it will
get picked up early rather than too late’.
Assuming the shortfall we have observed for tetralogy of
Fallot is not unique, we anticipate that other lesions with few
late symptoms—such as aortic coarctation—may be similarly
impacted by loss to follow-up. For such patients, the challenges
remain about if and how the specialist community should reach
those not receiving any follow-up at all, as well as ensuring that
those currently seen in non-specialist adult cardiology services
receive optimum surveillance.
Limitations
Data linkage has been possible for all but 27/1085 patients; the
proportions of these 27 patients who may have died, moved
abroad, changed their names or whose original data were incor￾rect is unknown and would have a bearing on the estimates we
provide. The cardiac status of the patients not under specialist
follow-up may be better, worse or similar to those who are,
though we have no particular indication that their original loss
to follow-up was informative in this respect. Though we know
that at least three early patients had catastrophic brain damage
perioperatively and other adults (at least five) have Down’s or
Noonan’s syndromes, ascertainment is too inconsistent to be
able to explore whether or not such patients are under￾represented or over-represented among those lost to follow-up
entirely or are seen in non-specialist cardiology clinics. We also
have no data about the causes of about half the late deaths.
The research ethics committee dealing with the telephone
contact stipulated that patients should not be contacted without
the participation of their GPs and that patients should be left
with the initiative concerning the phone calls. In the event, we
received no response to 40% of the letters sent to GPs and of
the patients approached with their GPs consent, only 42%
agreed to be contacted. We have observed elsewhere the require￾ment of a patient’s involvement being contingent on their GP’s
cooperation has negatively impacted research findings in other
contexts 15 and here too the potential for bias from this short￾fall makes it unrealistic for us to estimate the proportion of
‘lost’ patients who would like to return to follow-up. However,
the insights provided by those who we did speak to have furth￾ered our understanding of why patients are not being seen and,
although not an aim of the study, the request for referral for
specialist follow-up from a significant proportion of those we
spoke to is a positive outcome of this work.
Conclusions
A significant number of patients living after Fallot surgery are not
getting the follow-up they need. If the 25% of patients not in spe￾cialist follow-up documented here for tetralogy of Fallot is typical
of ‘moderate’ congenital heart disease in general, 15 000 patients
in England and Wales may similarly be inadequately served.1
Patients with a clinical background of congenital heart disease—
however well currently—should be encouraged back into specialist
Adult Congenital cardiology clinics. ACHD is a new class of
disease and complete datasets like this one are needed to delineate
its natural history, inform appropriate and cost-effective follow-up
programs and define treatment requirements.
