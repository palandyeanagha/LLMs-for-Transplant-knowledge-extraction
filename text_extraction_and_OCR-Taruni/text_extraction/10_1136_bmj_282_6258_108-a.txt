Serum antibodies to anaerobic
coccoid rods in patients with
Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis,
and in medical and nursing staff
The faecal flora of patients with Crohn's disease contain more
anaerobic Gram-negative rods and Gram-positive coccoid rods of the
genera Peptostreptococcus and Eubacterium than those of controls.1 2
The sera from patients with Crohn's disease also agglutinate certain
strains of Peptostreptococcus and Eubacterium more frequently than
sera from patients with other diseases and from healthy subjects.
Based on this preliminary work four organisms, including two strains
of Eubacterium contortum (Me 44 and Me 47), Eubacterium rectale
(Me 46), and Peptostreptococcus productus (C18) have been used in
agglutination studies to assess the possibility of patients having
Crohn's disease.3 The composition of faecal flora in patients with
Crohn's disease appeared to be independent of the duration and
severity of the illness. In this study we reviewed the serology of
patients with inflammatory bowel disease and of medical and nursing
staff in close relationship to such patients. A healthy control group of
blood donors was also included for comparison.
Methods and results
Sera were obtained from 20 patients with Crohn's disease and 17 with
ulcerative colitis; further samples were taken from 19 nurses and 13 doctors
who worked regularly in a clinic for inflammatory bowel disease, and from 12

blood donors. All were tested in Rotterdam against the four strains of
bacteria without knowledge of the source of samples. The probability of
each subject having Crohn's disease was calculated by a technique described
by van de Merwe.3 Sera were classified according to whether they indicated
definite, probable, suspected, or no Crohn's disease (table). Results from
agglutination tests were decoded in Cardiff.
Fifteen of the 20 patients with Crohn's disease were identified and in
12 the result of the serological test was considered definite (table). Six of the
17 patients with colitis also had a positive result (p>08), and four of these
results were graded as definite. Of the 32 medical and nursing staff, only one
had a positive result, and this subject had a history of undiagnosed abdominal
pain. None of the 12 healthy blood donors had raised antibody titres.
Comment
The finding of abnormal faecal flora in patients with Crohn's
disease is paralleled by the presence of corresponding serum antibodies
in most of these patients.1 2 About one-tenth of patients with ulcerative
colitis also have raised antibody titres.5 We found none of these
antibodies in medical and nursing staff who regularly cared for
patients with inflammatory bowel disease. This supports the finding4
in a study of household contacts of a group of 10 patients with Crohn's
disease. All household contacts had shared a home with a patient for
five to 25 years and 25 out of 27 first-degree relatives and eight
spouses had normal faecal flora. These findings suggest that Crohn's
disease is unlikely to be contagious.
The agglutination test discriminates between healthy subjects and
patients with either Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. In addition
15 of the 20 patients with Crohn's disease showed positive serological
findings compared with only six of the 17 patients with colitis.
Although this is an apparently high false-positive score, the difficulties
in differential diagnosis with the two conditions may in some cases
lead to reclassification in the future.

An unusual presentation of
opportunistic mucormycosis
We describe a fatal case of mucormycosis which complicated the
treatment of a patient with acute myeloblastic leukaemia. Obstruction
of the superior vena cava was a misleading and unreported clinical
manifestation of this infection.
Case report
A 64-year-old man was admitted with a two-week history of malaise.
Examination showed pallor and severe oral candidiasis but no lympha￾denopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. Investigation showed haemoglobin
concentration of 9 1 g/dl, platelets 75 x 109/1, white cell count 5 x 109/1
(neutrophils 3 %, lymphocytes 28 %, myeloblasts 69 %). Auer rods were
demonstrated. Acute myeloblastic leukaemia was confirmed on marrowProtected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies.

examination, and the blast cells were Sudan-black positive, periodic acid
Schiff-negative. Marrow chromosome analysis was normal. Cell surface
markers showed that 85 %N of the cells were Ia positive, while 8 % were TdT
positive, suggesting that a small proportion of the blast cells were lymphoid.
He was nursed under laminar-flow conditions, with gut decontamination,
and was started on the following chemotherapy: daunorubicin 40 Mg/in2
day 1, thioguanine and cytarabine 100 Mg/in2 twice a day on days 1 to 5.
Despite two courses, his blood and marrow remained in florid relapse. Over
these four weeks he had a right basal pneumonia, which responded to
gentamicin and carbenicillin, and oesophageal candidiasis, which was
treated with flucytosine. Treatment was changed to a seven-drug regimen,
TRAMPCO1 (prednisolone reduced to 40 mg/day). Two courses of this
succeeded in reducing, but not eliminating, circulating myeloblasts.
After his last course, symptomatic candidiasis recurred when flucytosine
was temporarily discontinued, and shortly thereafter he developed a left
basal pneumonia with progressive deterioration, despite further broad￾spectrum antibiotics. Within 48 hours signs of superior vena caval obstruction
appeared with plethora, facial swelling, and distended neck veins. A chest
radiograph showed a right-sided mediastinal mass with a right-sided sub￾pleural effusion (see figure). Bronchoscopy showed splaying of the carina
and narrowing of the right bronchus but no specific features; the results of
mycological, cytological, and bacteriological examinations of the bronchial
and pleural aspirate were negative, and a bronchial biopsy specimen showed
nothing abnormal.

Though prednisolone 60 mg/day produced symptomatic and clinical
improvement of the superior vena caval obstruction, his general condition
deteriorated and within two weeks he developed a further homogeneous
consolidation in the left mid-zone. All treatment was discontinued and he
died one week later, 12 weeks after initial presentation.
At necropsy there was thrombosis of the superior vena cava, multiple
thrombi within the pulmonary arteries with infarction of adjacent lung
tissue, and thrombosis of the splenic vein and minor veins of the left kidney.
Many broad hyphae, confirmed to be phycomycetes, were found on micro￾scopic examination of the pulmonary infarcts and throughout the thrombus
and walls of the superior vena cava.
Following a postmortem diagnosis of mucormycosis, direct culture of the
dust and the outer surface of the air filter grew colonies of mucor and
aspergilli, though air samples within the unit did not.
Comment
Mucormycosis represents an infection by any genus of the class of
fungi phycomycetes. It has been the subject of few reports from
Britain but is well recognised in North America as an opportunistic
infection of increasing importance, especially in patients with
leukaemia or lymphoma.2 It is a frequent commensal in sputum but,
in the invasive form, isolation is difficult, and diagnosis depends on
the findings in a tissue biopsy specimen. Candida, particularly of the
oesophagus, is a common associated infection.3 Fungal-induced
thrombosis, with consequent infarction of adjacent tissue, is
characteristic of mucor and aspergillosis.' Obstruction of the superior
vena cava, however, has been reported only with aspergillosis.4
Mucormycosis carries a high mortality and survival is rare unless
the underlying disorder can be controlled.2 Though flucytosine
appears to be ineffective, amphotericin B has been reported to be
beneficial.5
In the immunosuppressed patient, who develops features suggestive
of widespread thrombosis and infarction and a fever unresponsive to
antibacterial antibiotics, mucormycosis should be seriously considered.
Treatment with amphotericin B may be indicated in these circum￾stances, though diagnosis should normally be confirmed histologically
-if necessary by open lung biopsy.
We thank Dr R Reid of the university department of pathology and the
medical mycology unit for establishing postmortem diagnosis of mucor￾mycosis.

Fatal pseudomembranous colitis
despite eradication of
Clostridium difficile
Pseudomembranous colitis is associated with toxin-producing
Clostridium difficile in the stool.'-3 Treatment with vancomycin
usually results in rapid clearance of the organism and toxin from the
stool, resolution of the diarrhoea, and prompt healing of the mucosal
lesions.3 A high relapse rate, however, has recently been reported
after vancomycin treatment.4 We report a case in which histological
changes persisted despite elimination of C difficile and its toxin by
vancomycin.
Case report
A 49-year-old man presented in 1977 with erythema nodosum proved on
biopsy, anaemia, fever, and a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Intensive
investigation failed to discover the underlying cause. There was no response
to a prolonged trial of specific antituberculous chemotherapy, and from
August 1978 corticosteroids were required to control his symptoms.
In April 1979 he developed extensive pyoderma gangrenosum with
severe secondary infection for which flucloxacillin 500 mg four times daily
and amoxycillin 500 mg three times daily were prescribed. One week later
he developed abdominal pain and severe diarrhoea, and the antibiotics
were stopped. Sigmoidoscopy showed florid pseudomembranous colitis,
and biopsy of the lesion confirmed the diagnosis. C difficile and toxin were
detected in faecal specimens, and on 17 May oral vancomycin 125 mg four
times daily was started. His condition continued to deteriorate, and on 21
May the vancomycin dose was increased to 500 mg four times daily
and metronidazole suppositories added. Subsequent laboratory tests showed
that the organism and toxin had disappeared from the stool within two
days after the start of treatment, and three further specimens taken at
intervals up to the time of death were negative. Despite clearance of the
organism there was no clinical response and repeat sigmoidoscopy showed
persistent pseudomembranous colitis.
On 24 May he developed leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, and tinnitus
and on 25 May vancomycin was stopped. The next day he collapsed and
died. Postmortem examination showed advanced bronchopneumonia and
