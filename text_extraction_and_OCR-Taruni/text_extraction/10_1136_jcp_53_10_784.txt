Abstract
Aims—Type C gastritis caused by bile reflux has a characteristic
appearance, similar to that seen in other forms of chemical gastritis,


such as those associated with NSAIDs or alcohol. An increase in
mucosal cell proliferation increases the likelihood of a neoplastic
clone of epithelial cells emerging, particularly where there is
chronic epithelial injury associated with bile reflux. It has been
shown previously that type C gastritis is associated with increased
cell proliferation in the postsurgical stomach. The aim of this study
was to determine cell proliferation in type C gastritis caused by bile
reflux affecting the intact stomach.
Methods—Specimens from 15 patients with a histological diagnosis
of type C gastritis on antral biopsy were obtained from the
pathology archives between 1994 and 1997. A control group of nine
normal antral biopsies was also selected and all underwent MIB-1
immunostaining. The gastric glands were divided into three zones
(zone 1, gastric pit; zone 2, isthmus; and zone 3, gland base) and
the numbers of positively staining nuclei for 500 epithelial cell
nuclei were counted in each zone to determine the percentage
labelling index (LI%).
Results—Cell proliferation was significantly higher in all three zones
of the gastric glands with type C gastritis compared with controls as
follows: zone 1, median LI% in type C gastritis 64.7 (range, 7.8–
99.2), controls 4.7 (range, 2.0–11.3); zone 2, median LI% in type C
gastritis 94.7 (range, 28.8–98.7), controls 40.2 (range, 23.1–70.3);
and zone 3, median LI% in type C gastritis 20.0 (range, 1.3–96.0),
controls 2.6 (range, 0.9–8.7).
Conclusions—Bile reflux is thought to act as a promoter of gastric
carcinogenesis in the postsurgical stomach. The same may be true
in the intact stomach.
