Brain atrophy in chronic alcoholic patients:
a quantitative pathological study
CLIVE HARPER, JILLIAN KRIL
From the Department ofNeuropathology, Royal Perth Hospital, Perth, Australia
SUMMARY There are essentially no objective neuropathological data on brain atrophy in chronic
alcoholic patients despite numerous neuroradiological studies which show a high incidence of
shrinkage or atrophy. Therefore measurements were made of the intracranial volume (ICV) and
brain volume (BV) in a necropsy study of 25 chronic alcoholic patients and 44 controls. The
pericerebral space (PICS) was calculated according to the formula PICS = ICV BV x
The PICS will increase in patients with brain atrophy since the ICV remains constant throughout
life. The mean PICS value was 8-3% in controls, 11-3% in the alcoholic group, 14-7% in
alcoholics with superimposed Wernicke's encephalopathy (thiamine deficiency) and 16-2% in
those alcoholics with associated liver disease. Thus there was a statistically significant loss of brain
tissue in chronic alcoholic patients which appeared to be more severe in those with associated
nutritional vitamin deficiencies or alcoholic liver disease.
Brain shrinkage in chronic alcoholic patients as
demonstrated by pneumoencephalographic studies'
and computed tomography2-4 is now a well accepted
fact. That some of this shrinkage is reversible follow￾ing prolonged abstinence from alcohol is also well
documented.56 Abnormalities of brain function
including specific cognitive deficits7 and a more gen￾eralised global dementia may well relate directly to
chronic alcohol abuse.8 Pathological data on the
cerebral cortex of these cases are somewhat sparse
and continual pleas have been made by many
authors in the last decade for more detailed
neuropathological studies of the brains of alcoholic
patients.8-'0 Courville" commented on widespread
cortical atrophy with preferential involvement of the
frontal lobes in chronic alcoholics. Victor, Adams
and Collins'2 noted cerebral cortical atrophy in 27%
of their cases of Wemicke' s encephalopathy.
Although most cases of Wernicke' s encephalopathy
are associated with chronic alcoholism,'3 pathologi￾cal studies of these cases have been directed at the
more traditional periventricular lesions. Studies of

the cerebral cortex have not extended beyond the
subjective assessment of the presence or absence of
cerebral atrophy macroscopically and comments
such as "patchy cortical neuronal loss" at the mic￾roscopic level."'13 An additional complication in
studying cases of Wernicke's encephalopathy is that
these patients may have a mixture of pathological
entities. They have a proven nutritional vitamin
deficiency (thiamine), often chronic liver disease
(fatty liver or cirrhosis) as well as a long history of
ethanol abuse. Fortunately, those patients with
hepatic encephalopathy and/or Wemicke' s
encephalopathy can be identified at necropsy by
detailed microscopic neuropathological studies.
There is some indirect objective pathological evi￾dence that brain atrophy occurs in chronic alcoholic
patients. It has been shown that the mean brain
weight of chronic alcoholic males is significantly less
than that of a control group.'4 '5 However, the
interpretation of any brain weight study is difficult
because of the wide range of normal values.'4 The
results would be far more meaningful if a reduction
in the brain weight and volume could be
documented in relation to the time span of alcohol
abuse. This can be achieved by measuring both the
brain volume (BV) and the intracranial volume
(ICV). During childhood the growth of the brain
determines the growth and expansion of the skull'6
and the ICV remains unchanged during life.'7 In the

normal population there is a close correlation bet￾ween BV and ICV.'7'8 There are very few large
studies of these parameters in either normal popula￾tions or pathological states. This probably relates to
the logistic and mechanical difficulties of obtaining
these measurements during routine necropsies. The
authors have recently described a new technique for
measuring the ICV by making polyurethane foam
casts (fig 1) of the intracranial cavity.'9
The most useful parameter which can be derived
from the ICV and BV measurements has been
termed the pericerebral space (PICS).'7
PICS = ICV BV x 100 %
In effect the PICS is a measure of the volume of
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) covering the surface of the
brain and lying within the various cisterns (fig 2).
This does not include ventricular or spinal CSF. As
the brain becomes atrophic or shrinks the PICS
value will increase.'7 1' This study compares the
PICS values of alcoholics and controls.
Materials and methods
One hundred and fifteen cases were studied in conjunction
with the Forensic Pathologist of the Perth City Coroner's
Department. One of the authors (JK) attended the necrop￾sies and carried out the procedures as described herein.
Cases for the study were selected on the basis of a nega￾tive neurological history apart from alcohol related disor￾ders such as Wernicke's encephalopathy or epilepsy (a
significant proportion of alcoholics are also epileptic90).
Cases in which brain swelling was likely to have occurred
(for example head injuries) and cases which had macros￾copic evidence of swelling were excluded. Assessment of
" alcoholic" or "control" status was based on clinical notes
available from the major teaching hospitals in Perth as a
result of previous admissions. These were available in 70%
of cases. The next of kin were interviewed when possible to
assess the duration and quantity of alcohol consumption
and the person's nutritional status. All cases were subject
to a complete necropsy with microscopic examination of
tissues. Relevant findings such as fatty liver or cirrhosis
were helpful indicators of the extent of alcohol abuse.
Reports concerning the circumstances surrounding the
death were also helpful. In many cases liver function tests
were available and in six cases, CT scans had been done
during previous hospital admissions (fig 3).
After consideration of all the available data, 69 of the
115 cases were selected for this study. There were 25
alcoholic patients and 44 controls.
The necropsies were carried out in a standard fashion as
was removal of the brains. The dura mater was left attach￾ed to the skull. The brain was dried and weighed immedi￾ately on a standard balance which has a nominal error of

these tests. Because we were only interested in PICS values

Of the 69 selected cases there were 44 controls and
25 alcoholics, ten of whom had chronic Wernicke's
encephalopathy (microscopic diagnosis). The results
of this latter group were analysed separately
(alcoholiclWernicke's encephalopathy group). The
PICS clinical details for each of the alcoholic groups of

patients are summarised in table 1. As is generally
the case in any study of an alcoholic population, the
males outnumbered the females (5:1). The mean
age of the control group was 58 years which was the
same as the alcoholic/Wernicke's encephalopathy
group. However, the mean age of the alcoholic
group was 50 years. Six of the alcoholic cases were

cerebellar vermal atrophy.
It can be seen (table 2) that there is some correla￾tion between the PICS values and the subjectively
assessed cerebral cortical atrophy and ventricular
dilatation. Assuming the upper limit of normal for
PICS values to be 14-9% (mean plus two standard
deviations), eight (32%) of the 25 alcoholic cases
had PICS values above this limit. Of these eight
cases, five had cortical atrophy and six had ventricu￾lar dilatation. Of the remaining 18 cases only three
cases were considered to have cortical atrophy and
ventricular dilatation. Cerebellar vermal atrophy
was noted in 36% of the alcoholic cases.
Liver disease was present in 40% of the 25
alcoholic cases (table 3). There were only two cases
with cirrhosis, the remaining eight having fatty liv￾ers. The incidence of liver disease was higher in the
alcoholic/Wernicke's encephalopathy group. Only
one case (case 117) had histological evidence of
hepatic encephalopathy. The mean PICS value for
the alcoholic patients with liver disease was 16-2%
compared to a mean PICS of 10*3% for those
alcoholics with normal livers.
Discussion
The results of this study provide objective patholog￾ical evidence that a significant proportion of chronic
alcoholic patients have brain atrophy. The atrophy
was reflected by an increase in the volume of the
pericerebral space (PICS). PICS values were higher
in those alcoholics who had superimposed Wer￾nicke's encephalopathy caused by thiamine defi￾ciency, and were highest in those with alcoholic liver
disease (fatty liver or cirrhosis). The increase in
PICS values corresponds to a mean loss of brain
tissue of 41 g in the alcoholic group, 89 g in the
alcoholic/Wemicke's encephalopathy group and 109
g in the alcoholic/liver disease group. Similar results
were found in our alcoholic brain weight study in
that the male alcoholic group who all had cirrhosis
had a mean brain weight of 75 g less than controls
whereas that of the alcoholic/Wemicke's
encephalopathy group was 65 g less.'4 Torvik and
his colleagues'5 documented a mean brain weight
difference of 31 g in comparing 545 male alcoholics
with 586 controls.
It is important to note that there is a wide scatter
of PICS values in the alcoholic groups and in fact
only 32% of the cases had a PICS value higher than
the normal range (mean plus two standard devia￾tions = 14-9%). Thus the very high incidence (up to
100%) of cerebral shrinkage in alcoholics as demon￾strated in several CT scan studies are not reflected in
this pathological study.522
The accuracy and hence usefulness of the subjec￾215
tive evaluation of macroscopic cerebral cortical
atrophy and ventricular dilatation can be readily
assessed from this study. There does appear to be a
reasonable correlation between the subjective
assessment of cortical atrophy and ventricular dila￾tation and high PICS values (table 2). However, the
measurement of the PICS is obviously a far more
accurate way of identifying loss of brain tissue. The
incidence of cortical atrophy in this study (32%)
compares with previous studies of alcoholics with
Wernicke's encephalopathy in which atrophy was
noted in 27%12 and 21%'3 of cases. Cerebellar ver￾mal atrophy was present in 36% of the alcoholic
cases. This is also consistent with other studies in
that vermal atrophy was noted in 34% of 131 cases
of Wemicke's encephalopathy.'3 The cerebellum is
normally about 10% of the brain volume. Thus loss
of cerebellar tissue, as in vermal atrophy, would be
unlikely to cause a significant increase in the PICS
value.
Table 4 summarises previous intracranial volume
studies and derived PICS values in control
groups."7 123-27 Techniques have varied from filling
the base of the skull and skull cap with water,23 sand
or even ball bearings to the inflation of a balloon
with water inside the cranial vault.27 The ranges of
normal values are generally similar to ours. Davis
and Wright'7 showed a gradual increase in PICS
with age. This was also evident in our control data,
the increase being about 0- 1 % per annum after the
age of 25 years. This, however, does not enter into
the comparative statistical evaluations in this study
as the mean age of the controls was the same or
higher than that of the alcoholic groups (table 1).
An important question to consider in any nec￾ropsy study is the possible changes which might have
occurred between the time of death and time at
which the necropsy is done. Appel and Appel28 and
Sarwar and McCormick29 claim that the brain
increases in size after death, possibly due to the
absorption of CSF. Hubbard and Anderson27 found
that there is an estimated 5-9% decrease in ventricu￾Table 4 Literature review-PICS* values in controls

lar volume after death due to the shift of CSF into
brain tissue. This observation was made by compar￾ing CT scans and ventricular volume measurements
after fixation of the brain. Davis and Wright'7
examined the question of changes in PICS values in
relation to the time delay between death and nec￾ropsy. They showed that the brain volume did not
change significantly up to five days after death. Our
results showed a similar lack of correlation. In fact,
the mean time delay was 22 hours in the control
group compared to 43 hours for the alcoholic
groups. According to the authors cited above28 29 this
should have caused a greater reduction in the PICS
value of the alcoholic group than the control group.
Hubard and Anderson27 used the balloon techni￾que'7 to determine PICS values in 20 cases of
Alzheimer's disease. However, to our knowledge
there has been no previous study of PICS values in a
group of alcoholic patients. Alexander and Looney'8
included two chronic alcoholic patients in their
study. The PICS values of those cases were 12-1%
and 15- 1%, both well above their stated normal
range of 4-9%.
Of some interest is the fact that alcoholics with
liver disease (fatty liver or cirrhosis) had higher
PICS values (16.2%) than those with normal liver
histology (10-3%). This finding was unrelated to
hepatic encephalopathy which was noted in only one
case. It has been previously suggested that cerebral
atrophy and associated ventricular enlargement in
alcoholics could be related to liver disease.30 Acker
et a13' recently addressed the same question and car￾ried out liver biopsies, CT scans and psychometric
tests on 41 alcoholic patients. They showed that the
degree of liver damage correlated significantly with
both sulcal and Sylvian fissure widening. This is con￾trary to the results of Lee and her colleagues32 who
carried out a similar study in a group of 37 young
alcoholics. They concluded that there was no
significant correlation between liver disease and cor￾tical atrophy, although four of their seven cases with
cirrhosis had cortical atrophy. They added that a
larger study was necessary to confirm their data.
Acker et a13' suggested that it would be interesting
to study the brains of patients with non-alcoholic
liver disease. Of the 115 cases in our original study,
there were two cases with cardiac cirrhosis. Their
respective PICS values were 15-4% and 23-9%,
both well above normal, but obviously no conclu￾sions can be drawn from these isolated cases.
In a separate study of the brains of 150 chronic
alcoholic patients (unpublished data), a subjective
assessment of cerebral atrophy and ventricular dila￾tation was made. Three groups of alcoholics were
identified according to whether they had cirrhosis
alone, Wernicke's encephalopathy alone or cirrhosis
plus Wernicke's encephalopathy. As shown in table
5 those alcoholics with cirrhosis alone had a much
lower incidence of cerebral atrophy and ventricular
dilatation than the other two groups. In addition,
there was no increase in the incidence of cerebral
atrophy in patients with Wernicke's encephalopathy
when cirrhosis was also present. These findings sug￾gest that the nutritional deficiency state which
causes Wernicke's encephalopathy (thiamine defi￾ciency) plays the major role in the causation of cere￾bral cortical atrophy in chronic alcoholics. This is
contrary to the results of this study in which PICS
values tend to be highest in those alcoholics with
liver disease.
In summary, as the result of the development of a
relatively simple technique for measuring the ICV at
necropsy by making a polyurethane foam cast, we
have been able to derive some accurate quantitative
data concerning loss of brain tissue in chronic
alcoholic patients compared to a control group. The
loss of brain tissue is significant and likely to be more
severe if the patient has Wernicke' s encephalopathy
(thiamine deficiency) and in those patients with
alcoholic liver disease even when there is no his￾tological evidence of hepatic encephalopathy. How￾ever, further studies will be necessary regarding the
complicated inter-relationships between cerebral
atrophy and the potential pathogenetic factors
which include alcohol, nutritional vitamin de￾ficiences and liver disease.
The material used in this neuropathological study
will be used for further quantitative morphometric
analyses to determine which areas of the cerebral
hemispheres are reduced in volume in chronic
alcoholic patients.
