Abstract
Introduction: Renal dysfunction is a common complication in patients with end-stage cirrhosis. Since the original
publication of the definition and diagnostic criteria for the hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), there have been major
advances in our understanding of its pathogenesis. The prognosis of patients with cirrhosis who develop HRS
remains poor, with a median survival without liver transplantation of less than six months. However, a number of
pharmacological and other therapeutic strategies have now become available which offer the ability to prevent or
treat renal dysfunction more effectively in this setting. Accordingly, we sought to review the available evidence,
make recommendations and delineate key questions for future studies.
Methods: We undertook a systematic review of the literature using Medline, PubMed and Web of Science, data
provided by the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients and the bibliographies of key reviews. We determined a
list of key questions and convened a two-day consensus conference to develop summary statements via a series
of alternating breakout and plenary sessions. In these sessions, we identified supporting evidence and generated
recommendations and/or directions for future research.
Results: Of the 30 questions considered, we found inadequate evidence for the majority of questions and our
recommendations were mainly based on expert opinion. There was insufficient evidence to grade three questions,
but we were able to develop a consensus definition for acute kidney injury in patients with cirrhosis and provide
consensus recommendations for future investigations to address key areas of uncertainty.
Conclusions: Despite a paucity of sufficiently powered prospectively randomized trials, we were able to establish
an evidence-based appraisal of this field and develop a set of consensus recommendations to standardize care and
direct further research for patients with cirrhosis and renal dysfunction.

Introduction
Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a unique form of kidney
injury resulting from renal vasoconstriction in the set￾ting of systemic and splanchnic arterial vasodilatation in
patients with advanced cirrhosis. HRS is typically subdi￾vided into two types: type-1 in which there is a rapid
deterioration in kidney function with the serum creati￾nine (Scr) increasing by more than 100% from baseline
to greater than 2.5 mg/dl within a two-week period,
whereas type-2 HRS occurs in patients with refractory
ascites with either a steady but moderate degree of func￾tional renal failure (≥ 1.5 mg/dl) or a deterioration in
kidney function that does not fulfill the criteria for HRS
type-1 [1]. In patients with advanced cirrhosis, HRS is
reported to occur in 18% within one year of diagnosis
and up to 40% at five years [2]. Untreated, median survi￾val is two weeks for patients with type-1 HRS and four
to six months in patients with type-2 HRS [3]. However,
many patients with lesser degrees of renal impairment
in the setting of cirrhosis do not meet the precise

definitions of HRS and, yet, have the same pathophysio￾logical basis to their renal impairment and, therefore,
could potentially benefit from therapies developed for
HRS. A consensus conference under the auspices of the
Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative (ADQI) was held in
2010. The purpose of this consensus conference was to
review the literature on renal impairment in cirrhosis
and to create the basis for a definition and classification
system of all forms of renal impairment including HRS,
from there to develop a broader understanding of its
epidemiology, review current knowledge in the field of
prevention and treatment, and develop the framework
for a research agenda in relation to this condition.
Material and methods
ADQI process
ADQI is an ongoing process that seeks to produce evi￾dence-based recommendations for the prevention and
management of acute kidney injury (AKI) and on differ￾ent issues concerning acute dialysis. It represents a non￾profit association with an elected rotating board. ADQI
conducts systematic reviews of the literature and pro￾vides expert-based statements and interpretation of cur￾rent knowledge for use by clinicians according to
professional judgment. The ADQI methods comprise (1)
systemic search for evidence with review and evaluation
of the available literature, (2) establishment of clinical
and physiologic outcomes as well as measures to be
used for comparison of different treatments, (3) descrip￾tion of the current practice and the rationale for use of
current techniques, and (4) analysis of areas in which
evidence is lacking and future research is required.
Prior to the conference, the organizing committee of
ADQI VIII identified five topics relevant to the field of
HRS (Table 1). We selected these topics with a set of key
questions based on (1) prevalence of the associated clini￾cal problem, (2) known variation in clinical practice, (3)
availability of scientific evidence, (4) potential importance
for clinical outcome, and (5) development of evidence￾based medicine guidelines. For each topic, we outlined a
preliminary set of key questions. We then assembled a
diverse international panel representing multiple relevant
disciplines (nephrology, hepatology, transplant surgery
and critical care), from a variety of countries and scienti￾fic societies based on their expertise in AKI and HRS.
Panelists were assigned to four to five person work
groups, one of whom served as the group facilitator with
each work group addressing one key topic.
ADQI activities were divided into a pre-conference,
conference and post-conference phase. During the pre￾conference phase, topics were selected, and the work
groups were assembled and assigned to specific topics.
Each group identified a list of key questions, conducted
a systematic literature search and generated a bibliogra￾phy of key studies. During this stage, the scope of the
conference was also defined and some topics were
excluded (Table 1). We then conducted a 2 1/2 -day
conference. Our consensus process relied on evidence
where available and, in the absence of evidence, consen￾sus expert opinion where possible. The quality of the
overall evidence and the strength of recommendations
were graded using the Grading of Recommendations
Assessment, Development and Evaluation system (Table
2) [4-6]. For interventions that have been studied using
randomized trials we pooled the results of various trials
using the Mantel-Haenszel method for calculating the
weighted summary odds ratio under the fixed effects
model. We also calculated the heterogeneity statistic
and incorporated it to calculate the summary odds ratio
under the random effects model [7,8]. Both fixed and
random effects models are reported.
During the conference, work groups assembled in
breakout sessions, as well as in plenary sessions where
their findings were presented, debated and refined. In
each breakout session, the work groups refined the key
questions, identified the supporting evidence, and gener￾ated practice recommendations and/or directions for
future research as appropriate. A series of summary
statements was then developed during the breakout ses￾sions and presented to the entire group, revising each
statement as needed until a final version was agreed
upon. Directives for future research were achieved by
asking the participants to identify deficiencies in the lit￾erature, determine if more evidence was necessary and if
so, to articulate general research questions. When possi￾ble, pertinent study design issues were also considered.
Final reports were summarized into a final conference
document by a writing committee.
Systematic review of the literature
For each topic, the systematic review included the devel￾opment of well specified research questions, literature

searches, data extraction of primary studies and existing
systematic reviews, tabulation of data, assessment of the
quality of individual studies, and assessment of the over￾all quality of the literature and summary conclusions.
Literature review was applied using key terms relevant
to the topic and electronic reference libraries with the
focus on human studies and limited to English language
articles published between January 1960 and December
2009. Study eligibility was based on population, inter￾vention, comparator, outcome, and study design relevant
to each clinical question. Although nonrandomized stu￾dies were reviewed, the majority of the Work Group
resources were devoted to review of randomized trials,
as these were deemed to be most likely to provide data
to support level 1 recommendations with very high- or
high-quality (A or B) evidence. Exceptions were made
for topics with sparse evidence. Each work group con￾ducted literature searches related to their topic ques￾tions via MEDLINE, PubMed, data provided by the
Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, Web of
Science and the bibliographies of key reviews and of all
articles that met the search criteria. Decisions to restrict
the topics were made to focus the systematic reviews on
those topics in which existing evidence was thought to
be likely to provide support for the guideline.
Evaluation of studies
A three-phase approach was used to construct the evi￾dence-based recommendations. The phases included a
systematic literature review of studies in HRS and AKI
in patients with cirrhosis, a comprehensive appraisal of
prior studies, and convening an expert panel to synthe￾size this information and develop consensus based
recommendations. The quality of the overall evidence
and the strength of recommendations were graded using
the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Develop￾ment and Evaluation system (Table 2) [4-6]. There were
four categories for the quality of overall evidence, ran￾ging from A to D. The strength of a recommendation
was determined by the quality of the evidence and was
graded Level 1, 2 or ‘not graded”. Recommendations
were “Not Graded” if they were not based on systematic
evidence and was used to provide guidance where the
topic did not allow adequate application of evidence.
Recommendation statements were developed from the
systematic review, existing guidelines identified in the
supplemental literature review, and expert opinion.
Recommendations were developed by incorporating the
best available evidence and expert opinion. Expert opi￾nion was used when evidence in the literature did not
exist to inform the decision. Recommendation state￾ments were incorporated when they met one of two cri￾teria: if there was strong literature-based evidence or if
the expert panel voted that the recommendation was
appropriate.
Results and discussion
I. Evaluation of renal function in patients with cirrhosis
1. Serum creatinine measurements should be used to
evaluate renal function in patients with advanced cirrhosis
until more reliable methods of measuring renal function
become generally available (1D)
Rationale: Serum creatinine (SCr) measurement remains
the most practical and widely accepted method for esti￾mating renal function in clinical practice in patients
with cirrhosis and is the basis of existing definitions of
AKI. The prognostic impact of renal function in liver
disease is reflected by the inclusion of SCr in the Model
for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, which is
used to prioritize patients for liver transplantation [9].
However, in cirrhosis, SCr is notoriously inaccurate in
the diagnosis of renal dysfunction as it overestimates
renal function due to decreased creatine production by
the liver, protein calorie malnutrition, and muscle

wasting [10-12]. Furthermore, the measurement of SCr
using the Jaffe method can be artificially lowered due to
hyperbilirubinemia [13], or raised by cephalosporins [14]
leading to variability in MELD scores [15]. Serum cysta￾tin C has been suggested as a sensitive marker of renal
function [16-22]; however, recent studies have shown
that like SCr, cystatin C is affected by age, gender, mus￾cle mass and liver disease and overestimates renal func￾tion in patients with cirrhosis [17,23].
Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is considered the best
estimate of renal function although there is no univer￾sally accepted gold standard for its measurement. Clear￾ance techniques using exogenous markers such as
radiocontrast media, inulin or radioisotopes provide a
more accurate measurement of GFR, but are labor
intensive and expensive and appear to be susceptible to
extra-renal clearance, overestimating GFR by as much as
20 mL/min/1.73 m2 [24,25]. For patients with liver dis￾ease, particularly those with advanced cirrhosis, none of
the exogenous clearance markers have been rigorously
studied. When properly performed, timed urinary collec￾tion of creatinine overcomes some of these limitations
[26,27], but due to increased renal tubular creatinine
secretion, creatinine clearance overestimates GFR mea￾sured by inulin clearance by a mean of 13 mL/min/1.73
m2 [27].
2. GFR derived equations should be used cautiously for
assessment of kidney function in cirrhosis since they tend
to overestimate GFR (2D)
Rationale: The Cockcroft Gault [28] and Modified Diet
in Renal Disease (MDRD) [29] equations are widely
used to estimate GFR (eGFR) in the general population
but consistently overestimate GFR in cirrhotic patients.
The Cockcroft Gault equation is heavily influenced by
weight as a reflection of lean body mass, which is not
applicable to cirrhotic patients, in whom edema and
ascites may account for a moderate and in some
patients, even a substantial proportion of their weight
[10,26,30,31]. Several retrospective evaluations of SCr￾based eGFR equations among liver transplant recipients
suggest that the MDRD equations were best able to esti￾mate GFR in comparison to radionucleotide GFR assess￾ment; however, the precision of all GFR equations was
poor [32,33]. Other eGFR equations such as the Chronic
Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI)
and cystatin C based eGFR, have been proposed; how￾ever, like the MDRD equations, they have not been vali￾dated in patients with liver disease [34-38]. Therefore,
we encourage very cautious use of these derived equa￾tions for the determination of GFR as they have not
been validated in patients with liver disease.
Recommendations for future research:
• Formulate a specific equation for the calculation of
GFR for patients with advanced cirrhosis by iohexol or
inulin GFR determinations along with measurement of
Scr and Cystatin C.
• Identify the role of ancillary renal testing such as
diagnostic doppler ultrasound as epidemiological mar￾kers for patients with cirrhosis and renal dysfunction.
• Evaluate the value of renal injury biomarkers such as
NGAL (neurtrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin), IL￾18 and KIM-1 (kidney-injury molecule) in the setting of
AKI within the spectrum of hepatorenal disease.
II. Definition and classification of renal impairment in
cirrhosis
1. Classify AKI in the setting of cirrhosis according to RIFLE
criteria (Not Graded)
Rationale: In 1996, the International Ascites Club (IAC)
proposed a definition and diagnostic criteria for HRS
[39] which was later revised in 2007 (Table 3) [40].
However, the rigid cut off value of SCr of ≥ 1.5 mg/dL
has limited prompt management of patients with milder
renal dysfunction. In 2004, the ADQI Workgroup devel￾oped a consensus definition and classification for AKI
known as the RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End￾Stage) criteria which stratified acute renal dysfunction
into grades of increasing severity based on changes in
SCr and/or urine output [41]. Subsequently it was recog￾nized that even smaller increases in SCr (absolute
increase in SCr ≥ 0.3 mg/dL) are associated with adverse
outcome [42]. As a result, the criteria was modified in
2007 to broaden the definition of AKI (Table 4) [43].
In critically ill patients with cirrhosis, AKI defined by
RIFLE criteria has been shown to be a predictor of hos￾pital survival [44-46]. The final consensus of the work￾group was to apply the RIFLE criteria to define AKI in
patients with cirrhosis irrespective of whether the cause
of the acute deterioration in renal function was related
to a functional or structural disorder (Table 5) [47].
This will certainly identify many patients with AKI with
normal SCr but low GFR and allow us to extend treat￾ment to patients at a lesser level of severity. In addition,
the overall consensus was to also propose that the term
hepatorenal disorders (HRD) be used to describe all
patients with advanced cirrhosis and concurrent kidney
dysfunction (Figure 1). HRD is thus defined as any form
of kidney disease occurring in patients with cirrhosis, be
it functional or structural in nature. Such a definition
will allow cirrhotic patients with renal dysfunction to be
properly classified, thereby allowing appropriate studies
to be conducted to define their prognosis and to devise
treatment options.
2. Classify CKD in the setting of cirrhosis according to
Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiatives (K/DOQI) (Not
Graded)
Rationale: As mentioned above, estimation of GFR in
cirrhosis is problematic; therefore, the application of the
Nadim et al. Critical Care 2012, 16:R23
http://ccforum.com/content/16/1/R23
Page 4 of 17

definition of CKD in cirrhosis is challenging. The Work
Group accepted the definition of CKD, as set out by the
practice guidelines from the K/DOQI Work Group [48],
of an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 calculated using the
MDRD-6 formula [29] for more than three months for
patients with cirrhosis (Table 5) [47]. Patients with type￾2 HRS who meet these criteria should be considered as
having CKD.
3. Acute on CKD in cirrhosis is defined as a rise in SCr ≥ 0.3
mg/dL in less than 48 hours or an increase in SCr ≥ 50%
from baseline, or in a patient with cirrhosis whose baseline
GFR has been < 60 ml/min calculated with the MDRD-6
formula for more than three months (Not Graded)
Rationale: It is important to recognize that AKI may
also occur in patients with preexisting HRD. The group
recognizes that acute on CKD does occur in cirrhosis
and has defined it using the RIFLE criteria for AKI and
K/DOQI guidelines for CKD (Table 5) [47].
Recommendations for future research:
• Multicenter, prospective, epidemiologic (observa￾tional) studies to:
- Investigate the incidence, prevalence, basic demo￾graphics and outcomes of patients with HRD
- Validate new diagnostic criteria of AKI, CKD and
acute on CKD for the cirrhotic population
- Determine whether the development of type-1 HRS
in a patient with pre-existing type-2 HRS is the same
as patients with pre-existing CKD
- Investigate the use of biomarkers to differentiate
between type-1 HRS and other forms of AKI in
patients with cirrhosis.

III. Pharmacologic treatment of HRS
1. We suggest using hemodynamic monitoring, when
possible, to help with the management of fluid balance in
patients with HRS (2D)
Rationale: The key management strategy for patients
admitted with cirrhosis is to avoid the development of
HRS by preventing relative renal hypoperfusion, main￾taining an effective circulating volume and renal perfu￾sion pressure. Assessment of intravascular volume in
patients with HRS, however, is challenging. Traditional
methods based on clinical examination and static mea￾surements of right atrial and pulmonary artery pressures
are of questionable accuracy in predicting volume
responsiveness and should be used with caution [49-53].
Goal directed therapy with 20% albumin increased cen￾tral blood volume and cardiac index, without subse￾quent changes in central venous pressure [54] as any
fluid bolus which initially expands the intravascular
space, will subsequently expand the ‘third space’. Func￾tional hemodynamic monitoring, using continuous cen￾tral venous pressures or indirect measurements of
cardiac indices, should be used when possible to assess
the short term response to a fluid volume bolus [55].
Although pulse pressure variation (PPV) derived from
analysis of the arterial waveform and the stroke volume
variation (SVV) derived from pulse contour analysis are
predictive of fluid responsiveness in patients receiving
volume-controlled mechanical ventilation [51], they are

not as reliable in septic patients and those on pressure￾support ventilation [53]. Serial echocardiography can be
used to assess changes in intravascular volume by mea￾suring inferior vena caval diameter, right ventricular
end-diastolic volume index, left ventricular end-diastolic
area index, and the global end-diastolic volume index,
but generally these are not as accurate as using PPV/
SVV, are operator dependent and have not been evalu￾ated in patients with cirrhosis [56,57].
2. We recommend that patients with type-1 HRS be
optimally resuscitated with albumin (initially 1 g of
albumin/kg for two days, up to a maximum of 100 g/day,
followed by 20 to 40 g/day) in combination with a
vasoconstrictor (1A), preferentially terlipressin (2C)
Rationale: The most effective method for treatment of
type-1 HRS currently available is the administration of
systemic vasoconstrictor drugs (Table 6) in order to
reduce the marked vasodilatation in the splanchnic and
systemic circulations thereby improving the associated
impaired circulatory function [58,59]. Although rando￾mized controlled trials [60-77] and meta-analysis [78,79]
of the combination of terlipressin and albumin have
been shown to reverse HRS type 1 and improve renal
function in patients with type-1 HRS (Figure 2), data
regarding survival benefit has been limited although it
may allow survival to transplantation (Figure 3). Ther￾apy should be discontinued after four days in non￾responders and only continued thereafter in partial
responders (SCr improves, but does not decrease to <
1.5 mg/dL). As terlipressin can cause organ ischemia, it
is contraindicated in patients with ischemic heart dis￾ease, peripheral vascular disease and/or cerebrovascular
disease and all patients should be monitored closely for
cardiac arrhythmias or signs of splanchnic or digital
ischemia. If terlipressin is unavailable, alternative vaso￾constrictors such as norepinephrine [69,77,80], vasopres￾sin [81] or a combination of octreotide and midodrine
[82-87], together with albumin should be considered.
Currently there are no randomized trials showing super￾iority of terlipressin in comparison to other
vasoconstrictors.
Recommendations for future research:
• Comparative randomized controlled trials of vaso￾constrictors are required to determine the merits of
vasopressin analogues, specifically terlipressin, against
alpha-adrenergic agents in patients with type-1 HRS.
• Randomized controlled trials of vasoconstrictors in
patients with type-2 HRS.
IV. Device management of hepatorenal syndrome
1. We recommend withholding renal replacement therapy
(RRT) in patients with decompensation of cirrhosis who are
not candidates for liver transplantation (1D)
Rationale: RRT improves short-term survival in severe
AKI and can be helpful in bridging patients to trans￾plant or treating patients who have acute but reversible
decompensation [88]. Although there is a preference for
continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) over
intermittent hemodialysis in hemodynamically unstable
patients [89-93], analysis of the currently published stu￾dies does not allow evidence-based guidelines for the
selection of RRT modality for the treatment of AKI in
the setting of HRS. CRRT use may be advantageous in
the management of HRS patients with AKI who are
hemodynamically unstable or those patients at risk of
elevated intracranial pressure such as patients with
acute fulminant liver failure or acute on chronic liver
failure [94,95]. However, prognosis in type-1 HRS is
very poor and RRT should be avoided in these patients
unless there is either an acute reversible component or
a plan for liver transplantation.
2. We suggest that artificial liver support therapies for HRS
be limited to research protocols (2D)
Rationale: Extracorporeal support systems in liver disease
can be divided into two broad categories: non-cell
[96-131] and cell-based systems (Table 7) [132-134]. Non￾cell based systems do not incorporate tissue and provide
only detoxification functions using membranes and adsor￾bents. These newer developing therapies are expensive
and have not as yet demonstrated a survival benefit in
patients with type-1 HRS despite improvements in neuro￾logical function and coagulation indices. Molecular

Adsorbent Recirculating System (MARS) is now commer￾cially available in the US and Europe. Although MARS
therapy has not demonstrated a definite survival benefit in
patients with liver disease, it has been shown to improve
hepatic encephalopathy (Figures 4, 5) [125-131]. Cell￾based systems aim to provide the excretory, synthetic, and
metabolic functions of the liver using living liver cells. In
addition to detoxification, cell-based systems can also pro￾vide some synthetic and regulatory functions; however,
they have mainly been tested in single-center phase I and
II trials, and none have yet received US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) approval.

Recommendations for future research:
• Further observational studies and ultimately rando￾mized controlled trials directed to the identification of the
appropriate indications, timing of intervention, and cost
effectiveness of supportive detoxification therapies. Conse￾quently, the most appropriate outcome for studies would
be short-term survival as a bridge to transplantation.
V. Interventional and surgical management of HRS
1. We recommend use of a transjugular intrahepatic
portosystemic shunt (TIPS) as a treatment option for
patients with type-2 HRS with refractory ascites who require
large-volume paracentesis (1C)
Rationale: Very few studies have assessed the role of
TIPS in patients with HRS (Table 8) [135-138]. In
patients with type-2 HRS, TIPS has been shown to
improve refractory ascites and improve renal function
without improvement in survival [138]. However, new
hepatic encephalopathy, deterioration of previous hepa￾tic encephalopathy [136] or mild and transient dete￾rioration of liver function tests [137] has been reported
following TIPS. In patients with type-1 HRS, TIPS may
improve renal function and survival [136,137]; however,
there is insufficient data to support the use of TIPS as a
first-line treatment of patients with type-1 HRS. TIPS is
not recommended in patients with severe liver failure
defined as serum bilirubin > 5 mg/dl, INR > 2 or Child￾Pugh score > 11, hepatic encephalopathy or severe car￾diopulmonary diseases.
2. We suggest liver transplantation alone for candidates
with type-1 HRS for less than four weeks and simultaneous
liver-kidney (SLK) for those at risk for non-recovery of renal
function (2D)
Rationale: As the waiting time for liver transplantation
has increased, the incidence of pre-transplant renal dys￾function and RRT has also increased. In patients with
renal dysfunction at the time of liver transplantation
(LT), it is important to know whether renal function
will improve, stabilize or continue to progress following
transplantation. However, the level and duration of
renal dysfunction, including RRT, beyond which renal
recovery is not possible following LT alone is unknown.
Several investigators have studied the impact of pre￾transplant AKI on post transplant outcomes; however,
the small study sample size, retrospective design, report￾ing bias, and variation in definitions used to define renal
dysfunction hinders comparison between these studies
[139-145].

Currently there are no standard criteria for the evalua￾tion, selection and/or allocation of a kidney at the time
of LT. Despite an increase in the rate of SLK transplan￾tation immediately following the implementation of the
MELD allocation system in March 2002 (Figure 6),
recent Organ Procurement and Transplantation Net￾work (OPTN) data suggest a decrease since 2007 which
may be due to consensus guidelines published at that
time [146,147]. Based on the published consensus guide￾lines, the OPTN Liver and Intestine Committee and
Kidney Committee recently developed proposed listing
criteria for SLK candidate selection and allocation (Pol￾icy 3.5.10) (Table 9).
The duration of pre-liver transplant kidney dysfunc￾tion or dialysis that is amenable to recovery is not
known. Retrospective studies from single centers have
shown the importance of the duration of > 12 weeks of
SCr ≥ 1.5 mg/dL and dialysis ≤ 4 weeks pre-transplant
on post transplant renal outcomes [140,143-145]. How￾ever, the renal outcome of patients dialyzed for > 4
weeks is unknown as many of these patients frequently
undergo SLK. Timing of dialysis is related to numerous
factors and is a complex process. Since a threshold of
dialysis duration that is sufficiently predictive of renal
recovery has not been established, and also because
initiation of dialysis is physician/center dependent,

The outcome measure is improvement of hepatic encephalopathy.

dialysis duration as a criterion for SLK should be used
with caution in patients who do not have end-stage
renal disease. The decision for SLK versus LT alone
should be undertaken with consideration of duration of
HRS, AKI and CKD and risk factors for progression of
CKD present at the time of liver transplant such as
hypertension, diabetes and obesity. Currently there are
several pitfalls with the SLK guidelines such as defini￾tion of AKI, GFR determination, timing of initiation of
dialysis and duration of dialysis. To that end, the ADQI
group unanimously agreed that using the existing litera￾ture is not sufficient to allow guidelines or criteria to be
set.
Recommendations for future research:
• Multicenter, prospective, observational studies in
patients undergoing SLK to determine:
- The predictive value of RIFLE classifications pre￾transplant on post liver transplant outcomes
- Which RIFLE class and for what duration of AKI
pre-transplant is associated with rates of renal recov￾ery that warrant SLK
- What is the recovery rate of native kidney function
in patients with pre-transplant type-1 or 2 HRS
• Epidemiologic studies that document long-term

patient and renal outcomes and the prognostic factors
for these outcomes in patients with HRS who receive
LT alone, who recover residual renal function, remain
on dialysis and those subsequently receiving renal
transplantation.
Conclusions
Since first defined in 1996 by the IAC, there has been
substantial progress towards understanding the patho￾genesis and natural history of HRS. However, there
remains a significant deficiency in our knowledge
regarding its management. The IAC has set out clear
diagnostic criteria for both acute and chronic forms of
HRS, but has not delineated guidelines for the diagnosis
of other forms of renal impairment in cirrhosis, be they
acute or chronic. Well-accepted definitions and staging
systems for CKD and AKI exist, but have not been con￾sistently applied to patients with advanced liver disease.
Indeed, it must be understood that although our recom￾mendations are based, to the best extent possible, on
data, there are insufficient data to guide many important
decisions. In addition, although our Work Group
included a wide range of specialists from around the
world, we do recognize that there exists regional hetero￾geneity in practice. As a result, our findings should be
considered a ‘first step’ in the process of standardization
of the definition of AKI in patients with cirrhosis. Once
agreed, these new diagnostic criteria of AKI for cirrhosis
will need to be validated and the threshold for the diag￾nosis of type-1 HRS may need to be revised to a lower
target value to allow patients with a lesser degree of SCr
rise to receive prompt appropriate treatment. In addi￾tion, criteria for SLK may need to be revisited in lieu of
the new classification and to determine whether the new
classification and definition will improve patient out￾comes. One clear conclusion of this ADQI meeting is
that multicenter, prospective, long-term outcome studies
in patients with advanced cirrhosis and HRS are
urgently needed.
Key messages
• The ADQI Work Group recommends incorpora￾tion of the modified RIFLE criteria to define AKI in
patients with cirrhosis irrespective of whether the
cause of the acute deterioration in renal function is
related to a functional or structural discorder.
• Regarding the current state of combined liver-kid￾ney transplantation in patients with cirrhosis and
kidney disease, including HRS, the ADQI group
unanimously agreed that using the existing literature
is not sufficient to allow guidelines or criteria to be
set.
• Multicenter prospective, long-term outcome stu￾dies in patients with advanced cirrhosis and HRS are
urgently needed.
