Summary
Background Breathlessness is a common and distressing symptom, which increases in many diseases as they progress 
and is diffi cult to manage. We assessed the eff ectiveness of early palliative care integrated with respiratory services for 
patients with advanced disease and refractory breathlessness.
Methods In this single-blind randomised trial, we enrolled consecutive adults with refractory breathlessness and 
advanced disease from three large teaching hospitals and via general practitioners in South London. We randomly 
allocated (1:1) patients to receive either a breathlessness support service or usual care. Randomisation was computer 
generated centrally by the independent Clinical Trials Unit in a 1:1 ratio, by minimisation to balance four potential 
confounders: cancer versus non-cancer, breathlessness severity, presence of an informal caregiver, and ethnicity. The 
breathlessness support service was a short-term, single point of access service integrating palliative care, respiratory 
medicine, physiotherapy, and occupational therapy. Research interviewers were masked as to which patients were in 
the treatment group. Our primary outcome was patient-reported breathlessness mastery, a quality of life domain in 
the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire, at 6 weeks. All analyses were by intention to treat. Survival was a 
safety endpoint. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01165034.
Findings Between Oct 22, 2010 and Sept 28, 2012, 105 consenting patients were randomly assigned (53 to breathlessness 
support service and 52 to usual care). 83 of 105 (78%) patients completed the assessment at week 6. Mastery in the 
breathlessness support service group improved compared with the control (mean diff erence 0∙58, 95% CI 0∙01–1∙15, 
p=0∙048; eff ect size 0∙44). Sensitivity analysis found similar results. Survival rate from randomisation to 6 months 
was better in the breathlessness support service group than in the control group (50 of 53 [94%] vs 39 of 52 [75%]) and 
in overall survival (generalised Wilcoxon 3·90, p=0∙048). Survival diff erences were signifi cant for patients with 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and interstitial lung disease but not cancer. 
Interpretation The breathlessness support service improved breathlessness mastery. Our findings provide robust 
evidence to support the early integration of palliative care for patients with diseases other than cancer and 
breathlessness as well as those with cancer. The improvement in survival requires further investigation.

Introduction
Breathlessness is a common and distressing symptom in 
many advanced chronic diseases, causing considerable 
disability, anxiety, and social isolation.1–3 Worldwide, more 
than 75 million people have breathlessness every year, 
including more than 90% of the 65 million people with 
severe lung disease,4
 more than 50% of the 10 million with 
incurable cancer, and 50% of the 23 million with heart 
failure.5,6 Breathlessness increases as the disease 
progresses,7
 is frightening for patients and families, and 
often results in emergency hospital admission because it 
is accompanied by feelings of loss of mastery over 
breathing and panic.7, 8
Once treatment of the underlying disease is optimised, 
breathlessness that continues is deemed refractory.1
Patients with refractory breathlessness in advanced 
disease have many symptoms and concerns that are 
complex and interact; consequently palliative care has 
been recommended.4,9 In this study, we developed and 
assessed a new short-term breathlessness support service. 
This provided one point of access for patients, brought 
together palliative care and respiratory medicine, and 
responded to the call for shared care at an earlier stage in 
disease than usual.10,11 We hypothesised that patients 
attending the breathlessness support service, compared 
with those receiving standard care, would have better 
mastery of breathlessness at 6 weeks.

UK, recruiting patients between Oct 22, 2010 and 
Sept 28, 2012. We screened for potential patients across 
three large teaching hospitals and via general 
practitioners.
Patients were included according to a standard 
proforma completed by the identifying clinician. 
Patients had to meet all criteria: refractory breathlessness 
on exertion or rest (MRC dyspnoea scale score ≥2), 
despite optimum treatment of the underlying disease, 
as deemed by the identifying clinician; advanced disease 
such as cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD), chronic heart failure, interstitial lung disease, 
and motor neuron disease; willing to engage with short￾term home physiotherapy and occupational therapy; 
and able to provide informed consent. Patients were 
excluded for any of the following: breathlessness of 
unknown cause; a primary diagnosis of chronic 
hyperventilation syndrome; completely house (or 
hospital or nursing home) bound, despite off er of free 
transport to clinic; or within 2 weeks of treatment for an 
acute exacerbation. Such patients were reapproached 
after 2 weeks.
Protocol, procedures, information sheets, consent 
forms, and questionnaires were approved through the 
inde pendent UK Integrated Research Approval System 
via the ethics committee at King’s College Hospital 
(Ref. 10/H0808/17). We then applied for and were 
granted NHS Research and Development approval in 
all recruiting sites. Patients gave written informed 
consent before enrolment. Our protocol12 followed 
CONSORT recommendations. There were no protocol 
deviations.
Randomisation and masking
Using data from the baseline interview, the King’s Clinical 
Trials Unit’s Online randomisation system, independent 
of research and clinical teams, randomly assigned (1:1) 
patients to the intervention (immediate access to 
breathlessness support service in addition to standard 
care) or control group (standard best practice; off ered 
breathlessness support service after 6 weeks). Allocation 
was done by minimisation13 to balance four potential 
confounders: cancer versus non-cancer, breathlessness 
severity (numerical rating scale >3 or not), presence (or 
not) of an informal caregiver, and ethnic origin (white or 
other). After randomisation, the clinical trials unit team 
informed the breathlessness support service clinic 
administrator of the patient’s study group via secure email, 
who then arranged clinic appointments accordingly. 
Research nurses and interviewers were masked to 
treatment allocation. Patients were aware of treatment 
allocation, and were asked not to disclose this information 
to interviewers or research nurses. The trial coordinator 
and the trial administrator were aware of treatment 
allocation; the coordinator informed the research nurses 
when, and with whom, they had to do interviews. 
Procedures
The breathlessness support service is an additional service 
to usual UK National Health Service (NHS) care. It is a 
multi-professional integrated service that combines 
respiratory, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and 
palliative care assessment and management. It brings 
together assessment and treatment of physical, emotional, 
psychological, and spiritual concerns, through one point of 
access. The service comprises (appendix pp 1–2) a fi rst 
outpatient clinic appointment with respiratory medicine 
and palliative care clinicians assessing present treatment 
and concerns. The patient (and family if present) is given a 
breathlessness pack including information, management, 
and pacing guidance, a hand-held fan or water spray, and a 
poem (a short mantra to help breathing and relaxation 
during crises) and helped to agree a crisis plan. A home 
assessment is done 2–3 weeks after the clinic visit by a 
physiotherapist and/or occupational therapist to assess the 
need for walking and home aids and adaptations, 
reinforcement of self-management, and further guidance 
on pacing and exercises, including a DVD when 
appropriate. 4 weeks after the fi rst clinic visit, a second and 
fi nal clinic appointment with a palliative care specialist is 
arranged to agree further actions and a discharge plan.
Service modelling for the breathlessness support service 
is built on the nurse-led clinic, developed by Bredin and 
colleagues14 and the palliative care and physiotherapy 
approach developed by Booth and colleagues,15 and 
systematic reviews,16 qualitative interviews,2
 cross￾sectional9,17 and longitudinal studies,18 and consultation 
with local stakeholders.12 These data suggested that 
breathlessness support services should provide one point 
of access, integrate palliative care with existing services,

Panel 1: Outcome, quality of life and health-care use assessments
• Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire, a 20-item validated health-related quality 
of life questionnaire in which experiences are rated on seven-point scales ranging 1 
(maximum impairment) to 7 (no impairment)19,20
• Severity of breathlessness in the previous 24 h on a 0–10 numerical rating scale 
(NRS), average, at rest, and on exertion12
• London Chest Activity of Daily Living, a questionnaire of the level of disability induced by 
breathlessness for 15 activities (in four areas: personal care, domestic, physical, and 
social); each activity is scored 0–5 (0=I wouldn’t do it anyway, 5=someone else needs to 
carry out the activity)12
• EQ-5D and EQ-VAS which assess mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain or 
discomfort, anxiety or depression according to three levels of severity (1=no problems, 
2=some or moderate problems, and 3=extreme problems), plus a Visual Analogue 
Scale (VAS) of present health-related quality of life, scored 0–10012
• Palliative care Outcome Scale, a ten-item measure for advanced disease widely 
validated in cancer and non-cancer; each item is rated 0 (no problem) to 
4 (overwhelming problem)21
• Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), a 14-item measure of psychological 
distress with separate anxiety and depression subscales12
• Client Services Receipt Inventory (CSRI)12 in which patients reported the health, 
voluntary, and social care services received over the past 3 months, or if follow-up 
since the last research interview12

off er outpatient and home contact, and focus on improving 
patient self-management.
Patients randomly assigned to the control group 
continued with optimum management as provided by 
their usual services in accordance with relevant UK 
guidance to ensure best practice (appendix pp 3–5). After 
the 6 week (primary endpoint) research interview, these 
patients were off ered the breathlessness support service.
Study measurements included the Chronic Respiratory 
Disease Questionnaire, severity of breathlessness in the 
previous 24 h, the London Chest Activity of Daily Living 
questionnaire, EQ-5D and EQ-VAS, the Palliative care 
Outcome Scale, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression 
Scale (HADS), and the Client Services Receipt Inventory 
(panel 1). These measurements were collected in a 
standard questionnaire booklet consisting of demographic, 
clinical, outcome assessments, and use of health-care 
services. Research data were collected in face to face 
interviews with patients, usually in their own homes, at 
baseline and 6 weeks follow-up (the primary endpoint). In 
addition face to face qualitative interviews were conducted 
after the trial was completed.
At baseline and 6 weeks follow-up, interviewers 
measured pulmonary function and oxygen saturation with 
a portable spirometer and fi nger pulse oximeter.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was breathlessness mastery at 
6 weeks as recorded in the 6 week face to face interview, 
determined according to one domain of the quality of life 
measure, the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire12,19
(panel 1). Mastery is the average of four questions about 
the feeling of control over the disease and its eff ects on 
quality of life and function (range=1 [maximum 
impairment] to 7 [no impairment]). Secondary outcomes 
included: severity of breathlessness on exertion in the 
previous 24 h, activity (assessed by London Chest Activity 
of Daily Living questionnaire), other domains of the 
Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire (breathless￾ness, fatigue, and emotional function), quality of life (EQ￾5D), palliative needs (assessed by Palliative care Outcome 
Scale), depression and anxiety (measured by the Hospital 
Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS]), and spirometry.
Patient survival (since randomisation) was planned to be 
calculated from dropout and missing data, with exact dates
extracted from clinical records, as a safety secondary 
endpoint, as recommended in clinical trials.22 We also 
planned to collect and analyse caregiver burden data. But it 
proved diffi cult to contact lay caregivers for consent 
because many used the research nurse visit as an 
opportunity to go out while someone was with the patient. 
Only 11 caregivers were interviewed at baseline and only 
four at 6 week follow-up. Therefore these data were not 
analysed further.
20 patients were purposefully selected for qualitative 
interviews, after completing the trial, to include a mix of 
ages, sex, diagnoses, and presence of caregiver. The 
interviews were semi-structured and followed a topic 
guide on patients’ expectations, experiences, and views 
about the content, format, and eff ect of the breathlessness 
support service. Questions were open-ended and not 
based on pre-existing theory. Interviews were tape￾recorded and transcribed verbatim.
Statistical analysis
On the basis of our primary outcome, the Chronic 
Respiratory Disease Questionnaire mastery domain, we 
estimated that more than 34 patients per group would 
detect a mean diff erence of 0∙70 (SD 1), a p value of less 
than 0∙05 at power 80%.19,20 To allow for a conservative 
estimated attrition of 40% we planned to recruit at least 
110 patients into the study.
All randomly assigned participants were included in 
the intention-to-treat analysis. Missing data were explored 
according to cause.23 Continuous variables, expressed as 
means and standard deviations, were compared with the 
Student’s t test. Categorical variables were compared with 
χ² test or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate. As

prespecifi ed, we used independent samples Student’s t
test to compare patient mastery (primary outcome) and 
secondary outcomes at 6 weeks, by trial group. Sensitivity 
analysis explored the robustness of results: fi rst, 
accounting for diff erences in patient diagnoses and 
baseline scores using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA); 
second, with multiple imputations of missing data;23 and 
third with pre-post analysis of breathlessness support 
service and control groups.
Survival was calculated from date of randomisation to 
date of death and plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method. 
Patients who were still alive on Sept 1, 2013, after the last 
patient was recruited were censored at this date. We 
calculated the survival rates to 180 days (6 months) from 
consent in both groups. With all data to 1 year from last 
recruitment, we assessed overall survival diff erence 
between two groups with the generalised Wilcoxon 
(Breslow) test, which is more sensitive in the detection of 
early diff erences in survival,24 which is important in the 
fast-track or wait-list design.
We calculated costs by combining Client Service 
Receipt Inventory data with UK 2011–12 unit costs.25 Cost 
data are usually skewed; therefore, we used a bootstrapped 
regression model to produce confi dence intervals. 
Statistical signifi cance was accepted for p values less 
than 0∙05.
Qualitative interviews were imported into NVivo version 
7 and content analysis explored patients’ own views and 
experiences of the breathlessness support service, and in 
particular how issues related to the primary and secondary 
outcomes. We created categories inductively, with attention 
to terms and content, from the interview data. Through a 
process of constant integration of categories and their 
properties, or constant comparison, the fi ndings became 
relevant at a more abstract level. We used simple counting 
when possible to discover more defi nite patterns in views. 
Member checks and teamwork were used to establish 
credibility.

NCT01165034.

problems or hospital admissions. Table 1 shows the 
baseline characteristics. Patients had severe disease: 
forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) was 46% predicted, 
vital capacity 58% predicted, oxygen saturation (SaO2 %) at 
rest 93%, average breathlessness 5∙9/10, on exertion 
8∙3/10. Their average Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire 
breathlessness mastery was 3∙4. Their average total 
Palliative care Outcome Score was 15/40, indicating 
important unmet palliative care concerns; for the HADS, 
the mean scores were 9 for anxiety and 10 for depression, 
both above the cutoff for clinical signifi cance.
At week 6, 82 of 105 (78%) patients completed 
assessments. The main reasons for attrition were illness 
or death (fi gure 1). Attrition to the primary outcome was 
slightly lower than estimated (22% not 40%); therefore, 
we agreed to stop recruitment after 105 patients had 
consented. Missing data, death, and dropout were not 
associated with baseline mastery score, FEV1 or other 
key variables except oxygen saturation (appendix p 7). 
Four patients died by week 6, two had cancer (one in 
breathlessness support service group), and two had 
interstitial lung disease (both in control group).
We recorded a signifi cant improvement in the primary 
outcome, the mastery domain of the Chronic Respiratory 
Disease Questionnaire, in the breathlessness support 
service group compared with the control group at 6 weeks 
(table 2). Patients receiving the breathlessness support 
service had on average a 16% improvement for 
breathlessness mastery over the control group (mean 
diff erence 0·58, eff ect size 0·44, control group mean 
score 3·57). Results were similar to those from our 
sensitivity analysis of the primary outcome: ANCOVA 
adjusted for diagnosis, p=0∙037; ANCOVA adjusted for 
diagnosis and baseline score, p=0∙05; multiple 
imputation (number of imputations 45) based on 
baseline score of the measure of interest, p=0∙07; 
adjusted for baseline score, diagnosis, FEV1, SaO2 %, 
p=0∙072; control and intervention groups were imputed 
separately. In further post-hoc sensitivity analyses, fi rst 
excluding patients referred or identifi ed via palliative 
care services, and second excluding those with cancer 
(because of potential bias of palliative care eff ect), we 
noted 6 week mean mastery scores of, respectively, 4·18 
(SD 1·2) in the intervention group and 3·54 (1·4) in the 
control group (p=0·043) and 4·19 (1·2) in the intervention 
group and 3·52 (1·3) in the control group (p=0·033).
We noted no signifi cant diff erences in patient-reported 
secondary outcomes between study groups at 6 weeks 
(table 2). For all items, except anxiety, the breathlessness 
support service group had better scores than the control 
group; this was largest, but not signifi cant, for the London 
Chest Activity of Daily Living questionnaire and 
breathlessness on exertion. Findings of pre-post analysis 
within groups (appendix p 8) showed signifi cant improve￾ments in the breathlessness support service group 
between baseline and 6 weeks for seven outcomes: 
mastery, total quality of life score, dyspnoea, and emotion, 
assessed by Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire, 
average breathlessness per 24 h, on exertion breathlessness 
per 24 h, and Palliative care Outcome Scale total score. No 
outcome showed deterioration. The control group had a 
signifi cant improvement between baseline and 6 weeks 
for only Palliative care Outcome Scale total score, and 
signifi cant deteriorations for London Chest Activity of 
Daily Living questionnaire and HADS.
We noted a signifi cant diff erence in survival for the 
whole sample that appeared early after randomisation 
(generalised Wilcoxon 3·90, p=0∙048). Survival was 
similar between the study arms for patients with cancer, 
but signifi cantly diff erent for patients without cancer: 
all 42 patients without cancer in the breathlessness 
support service group were alive through to 6 months 
(180 days), of the 42 control patients without cancer at 
baseline, 38 were alive at 90 days, and 32 at 180 days 
(table 3 and fi gure 2). The standard care group received 
the breathlessness support service by 120 days.

At 6 weeks, we noted no signifi cant diff erences between 
total formal care costs in the two groups. 6 week mean 
costs were £1422 in the breathlessness support service 
group (bootstrapped 95% CI 897–2101) and £1408 in the 
control group (899–2023). Costs varied greatly between 
individuals.
Improved knowledge, confi dence, and insight into how 
to function despite breathlessness were identifi ed as 
potential mechanisms in the qualitative analysis through 
which the breathlessness support service improved 
patient mastery (appendix pp 10–11).
Discussion
This is the fi rst randomised trial of a breathlessness 
support service integrating palliative care and respiratory 
medicine, and the fi rst powered trial to test early integrated 
palliative care including patients without cancer (panel 2). 
The breathlessness support service integrated respiratory 
medicine, palliative care, physiotherapy, and occupational 
therapy for patients with advanced conditions and 
refractory breathlessness. The service responds to calls for 
earlier integration of palliative care including for patients 
without cancer.10 At 6 weeks, the primary outcome, 
breathlessness mastery, improved more in the 
breathlessness support service group than in the standard 
care group. Qualitative data provided evidence of the 
breathlessness support service improving confi dence, 
function, and control over breathlessness. No secondary 
patient-reported outcomes were signifi cantly diff erent 
between groups, although there was evidence in the pre￾post analysis that the breathlessness support service group 
had improved activities of daily living and reduced 
breathlessness on exertion and depression. We recorded 
no harms of the breathlessness support service. The 
number of inpatient bed days and total formal care costs, 
on the basis of patient-reported total service use, were 
similar between groups.
Refractory breathlessness is a diffi cult clinical problem, 
usually the second most common symptom after pain in 
patients with advanced chronic disease, with high costs 
for society.3
 Oxygen has a role for individuals with severe 
hypoxaemia at rest or exercise desaturation, but is of little 
symptomatic value when patients are not hypoxic.39 Low￾dose, sustained-release opioids safely reduce breath less￾ness without respiratory depression,40 but no other 
eff ective drugs exist.1,3,41 Non-pharmacological treatments 
(eg, rollator devices, fan therapy, breathing control, and 
muscle strengthening) can provide benefi ts16 as can 
multidisciplinary rehabilitation programmes, but in 
advanced disease, many patients are unable to attend or 
benefi t.16,34 In this context, palliative care can have a role 
(panel 2), but robust trials are scarce.
Although the fi nding of improved mastery in patients 
in the breathlessness support service group might not be 
surprising, this service (integrated palliative and 
respiratory care) is not standard, and usual care did not 
achieve the same result. All patients had advanced and 
deteriorating disease, in the palliative phase of a 
progressive illness, in which breathlessness progressively 
increases up to death. Therefore, the fi nding of little 
change in our secondary outcomes is not surprising, 
especially ones such as spirometry. These data suggest 
that we included an appropriate group of patients.

Survival was calculated from the time of randomisation to the time of death, if death occurred during the study 
period, or to the time of censoring (Sept 1, 2013). Median days between randomisation to Sept 1, 2013, was 
745 (range 338–1075) for the breathlessness support service group and 711 (345–1045) for the control group. 
Tick marks show censoring of data. Overall generalised Wilcoxon (Breslow) was 3·90, p=0·048. In subgroup 
analysis, this pattern was not recorded for patients with cancer (0·01, p=0·97; n=21); but it became more marked 
for patients with diseases other than cancer (6·04, p=0·01; n=84). The pattern was recorded for patients with 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and separately in those with interstitial lung disease, although numbers are 
small for those with interstitial lung disease.

The American Thoracic Society defi nes breathlessness 
as “a subjective experience of breathing discomfort that 
consists of qualitatively distinct sensations that vary in 
intensity”.3
 Like pain, breathlessness is a subjective 
experience resulting from complex interactions between 
pathological, physiological, and emotional elements. 
Therefore, it is diffi cult to choose the correct outcome to 
measure in breathlessness trials. We chose a well 
established quality of life measure’s mastery domain, 
rather than levels of breathlessness, for several reasons. 
First, ratings of breathlessness levels are very variable 
and patients can have breathlessness attacks several 
times a day without constant breathlessness. Therefore, 
helping these patients to master their attacks might be 
more important than reducing the severity of one attack. 
Second, breathlessness is a limited endpoint because 
people perform activity to the highest level of 
breathlessness they can bear, but hope to do more before 
they reach that point. Breathlessness support services 
aimed to support and provide patients with coping 
strategies and interventions to help them master their 
breathlessness, while accepting that the disease cannot 
be cured and its natural history changed. Thus, the 
amount of perceived breathlessness mastery is probably 
a more important component of quality of life than is 
amount of breathlessness. As the qualitative results 
suggest, patients found this point important.
We found a diff erence in survival between study 
groups; patients in the control group had poorer survival 
in the early period of the study compared with patients 
in the breathlessness support service group. This 
diff erence was not found for patients with cancer, but 
was signifi cant for patients with diseases other than 
cancer, mostly in those with COPD and interstitial lung 
disease. We do not have reliable data for the longevity of 
the disease or prognosis before randomisation, which 
limits interpretation of this fi nding. However, our 
results support another trial of early palliative care,31
although we are the fi rst to fi nd a survival diff erence for 
patients with diseases other than cancer. Therefore, 
these results need further exploration and testing in 
future trials, as does the optimum timing of the 
breathlessness support service.
The breathlessness support service had some similar 
components to the breathlessness intervention service 
developed in Cambridge, UK in the late 2000s,15 including 
one point of entry, integration of palliative care with 
physiotherapy, some specifi c interventions, and 
education. However, there are diff erences between the 
services; we included assessment by respiratory medicine 
(a component valued by patients in the qualitative 
interviews), asked patients to attend outpatient clinics 
(the breathlessness intervention service is home based), 
and used the poem for crisis management.
Our study has limitations. We were only able to single 
mask the groups. Our primary outcome measure was 
subjective; patients who knew their study group could 
Panel 2: Research in context
Systematic review
In the past 4 years there have been calls for early integration of palliative care to support 
patients with advanced disease.10,11 We searched the scientifi c literature for evidence by 
extending three systematic reviews and one narrative review that assessed early palliative 
care in hospitals and at home.26–30 We updated their search terms and also searched for any 
studies with the keywords: palliative, integration, and early. Additionally, we searched for 
trials of service interventions for patients with breathlessness (or dyspnoea or dyspnea) in 
advanced diseases (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] or interstitial lung 
disease or heart failure or cancer) and on refractory breathlessness. Although many 
qualitative and descriptive studies have been done, we identifi ed only four trials of early 
palliative care; three of these for patients with cancer. Temel and colleagues31 and Bakitas 
and colleagues32 found early palliative care signifi cantly improved quality of life; the recent 
Zimmermann and coworkers trial28 found similar benefi ts. In non-cancer, there is one 
published phase 2 trial of early palliative care in patients with multiple sclerosis, which 
suggested early integrated palliative care improved symptom control.33 Although many 
interventions and services have been proposed to help patients with chronic 
breathlessness, such as pulmonary rehabilitation,34 and national initiatives such as 
IMPRESS aimed at the development of integrated population-based approaches to 
prevent, detect, and care for people aff ected by COPD,35 there are few for patients with the 
more advanced stages of illness or refractory breathlessness. We identifi ed two 
randomised trials, one in progress. Bredin and colleagues14 tested a nurse-led clinic for 
patients with lung cancer, not palliative care. A coauthor of this study, Booth, did 
observational work15 and is currently trialling a community-based palliative care and 
physiotherapy service, the breathlessness intervention service, but this does not have 
out-patient clinics or include respiratory medicine.36 In Canada, Rocker and Cook37
developed the INSPIRED model of care for patients with advanced COPD to off er a more 
integrated approach to care, with personalised action plans, advance care planning, and 
palliative treatments. We could fi nd no randomised trials of INSPIRED but observational 
data suggest the model reduces repeat admissions and is welcomed by patients. Horton 
and colleagues38 did an observational study to test the feasibility of home-based palliative 
care for patients and caregivers living with advanced COPD (30 patients enrolled and 
13 provided outcome assessments).
Interpretation
In this randomised controlled trial of 105 patients with refractory breathlessness, we 
noted that patients who received an integrated palliative care and respiratory 
breathlessness support service had signifi cantly improved breathlessness mastery at 
6 weeks. Mastery assessed patients’ feeling of control over their breathlessness and its 
eff ects on quality of life and function, and was on average 16% higher for those patients 
receiving the breathlessness support service. The breathlessness support service did not 
show a signifi cant advantage for other secondary outcomes, although there was a 
tendency for improvement in the ability to undertake activities of daily living, lesser 
depression, and lower breathlessness on exertion. Our fi ndings were supported by 
qualitative data. We did not fi nd a diff erence in formal care costs. Like Temel and 
colleagues’ trial,31 survival was better for the group receiving early breathlessness support 
service than the control group, although in this instance for patients with diseases other 
than cancer. In both these studies, survival was a secondary outcome, which suggests 
further research is needed. Our study supports the early integration of palliative care with 
respiratory medicine in non-cancer (eg, COPD, interstitial lung disease, and heart failure), 
focused on a group with refractory breathlessness. By being based mainly in outpatient 
settings and for a short term, the breathlessness support service meets the Block and 
Billings criteria of being scalable.11 As our trial was of one service, we suggest that the 
breathlessness support service warrants testing in multicentre randomised trials, and 
further studies comparing diff erent models and the timing of integration are needed.

have been subject to the placebo eff ect. However, 
participants were unaware that mastery was an 
endpoint because it was not emphasised in interviews 
and relevant questions were dispersed within the 
questionnaire. Additionally, the research nurse could 
have seen breathlessness support service equipment 
(eg, hand-held fan and information sheets) in the 
home, which could have biased their interviews. Our 
inclusion and exclusion criteria prevented extrapolation 
of study results to patients in the last month of life. 
Further, our outcome follow-up was short because of 
the fast-track nature of the trial. Although this short 
follow-up gave us acceptability from referrers and 
patients, it restricted our assessments, especially of 
care costs and long-term survival; the trial was not 
designed specifi cally to test for survival. We recruited 
from a small number of sites in urban areas where 
usual care at specialist centres was probably of an 
unusually good standard, with expert staff who were 
motivated to take part in this research. We were unable 
to contact more than a fi fth of patients screened and 
eligible for the study, and could not pursue this further 
because of data protection and ethics approval 
requirements. Therefore, we do not know how our 
recorded eff ects translate to other routine scenarios and 
settings. Some patients were identifi ed via palliative 
care services, which might have aff ected our results; 
however, the diff erence in our primary outcome 
remained when these eff ects were excluded.
Our primary outcome had an eff ect size of 0·44, 
smaller than that proposed in our sample size calculation. 
Puhan and colleagues20 recommended an eff ect size of 
0·7 for patient self-administered and 0·38 for interviewer￾administered questionnaires. We fi nd it surprising that a 
diff erence in interviewer should make such a diff erence 
in eff ect size, although this might be related to less 
variation in interviewer-administered formats. However, 
perhaps we should have used the more conservative 
0·38 in our sample size estimation.
This trial provides support for a more integrated 
approach to management of breathlessness within a 
breathlessness support service, which improves patient 
mastery without aff ecting overall care costs. The recorded 
improvement in survival needs further investigation. 
The breathlessness support service needs testing in 
multicentre, longer term trials including a wider range of 
urban and rural settings.
