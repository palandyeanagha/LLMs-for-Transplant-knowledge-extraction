INTRODUCTION
Programmed cell death (PCD) was
used synonymously with caspase-depen￾dent apoptosis until caspase-independent
cell death pathways were discovered
(1–4). PCD undoubtedly is of outstanding
clinical interest (5,6). In tumor necrosis
factor receptor (TNFR) signaling, the con￾glomerate of TNFR, TNFR1-associated
DEATH domain protein (TRADD), TNFR-
 associated factor 2 (TRAF2), polyubiquity￾lated RIP1 and inhibitor of apoptosis pro￾teins (IAPs), called complex I, results in
nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-mediated pro￾survival signaling. Recently, the linear
ubiquitin chain assembly complex
(LUBAC) has been demonstrated not only
to be an important part of complex I, but
also to be an important regulator of proin￾flammatory cell death induction by TNF
(7,8). The capability of cells to undergo
PCD following TNFR ligation depends on
deubiquitylation of RIP1, causing changes
in complex I composition (9,10) which
switches off the NF-κB pathways and en￾ables PCD signaling via complex II. PCD
encompasses both apoptosis and pro￾grammed necrosis, which signal via com￾plex IIa and complex IIb, respectively
(10–13). Complex IIa involves activation
of a caspase-8/ FLIPL hetero dimer that
leads to RIP1 inactivation, thereby pre￾venting the assembly of complex IIb (14).
In the absence of caspase-8, or if the het￾erodimer is blocked (for example, by cas￾pase inhibitors), RIP1 is not inactivated
and complex IIb mediates TNF-mediated
programmed necrosis (PN).
RIP1- and/or RIP3-dependent PN has
been defined recently as necroptosis in
the presence of caspase inhibition (15). In
the case of TNFR ligation, necroptotic
cell death was demonstrated in various
cell lines (for example, L929, HT29 and
FAS-associated death domain protein
(FADD)-deficient Jurkat cells) (12,16, 17).
In vivo, infection with vaccinia virus led
to 100% lethality of RIP3- deficient mice
whereas wild-type mice survived this in￾fection (18). Consequently, necroptosis
has been interpreted as a mechanism of
host defense against caspase inhibitor-
 expressing viruses (11,18). Further, physi￾ologically relevant necroptosis has been
demonstrated in T lymphocytes (19),

Tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) signaling may result in survival, apoptosis or programmed necrosis. The latter is called necrop￾tosis if the receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) inhibitor necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) or genetic knockout of RIP3 prevents it. In the lethal
mouse model of TNFα-mediated shock, addition of the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk (zVAD) accelerates time to death. Here, we
demonstrate that RIP3-deficient mice are protected markedly from TNFα-mediated shock in the presence and absence of caspase
inhibition. We further show that the fusion protein TAT-crmA, previously demonstrated to inhibit apoptosis, also prevents necroptosis in
L929, HT29 and FADD-deficient Jurkat cells. In contrast to RIP3-deficient mice, blocking necroptosis by Nec-1 or TAT-crmA did not pro￾tect from TNFα/zVAD-mediated shock, but further accelerated time to death. Even in the absence of caspase inhibition, Nec-1 ap￾plication led to similar kinetics. Depletion of macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, granulocytes or genetic deficiency for T lympho￾cytes did not influence this model. Because RIP3-deficient mice are known to be protected from cerulein-induced pancreatitis (CIP),
we applied Nec-1 and TAT-crmA in this model and demonstrated the deterioration of pancreatic damage upon addition of these
substances. These data highlight the importance of separating genetic RIP3 deficiency from RIP1 inhibition by Nec-1 application in
vivo and challenge the current definition of necroptosis.

photoreceptors (20) and in a stroke
model (21), and has been suggested to
contribute to the pathogenesis of myo￾cardial infarction (22) and kidney ische￾mia/reperfusion injury (23). Additional
evidence for the in vivo relevance of RIP3
has been added recently by the fact that
this protein mediates the lethal pheno￾type of caspase-8 deficient mice (14,24).
Above that, RIP3 deficiency partially
protects from cerulein-induced pancreati￾tis (CIP), suggesting that necrotizing
pancreatitis may be attenuated by phar￾macological interference of this pathway
(16,25). The extraordinary specificity of
Nec-1 to interfere with RIP1 phosphory￾lation has been studied extensively
(26,27) and has been demonstrated to
protect from myocardial infarction and
stroke in vivo (21,22). Because attempts to
block apoptosis in lethal TNFα-mediated
shock employing the pan-caspase in￾hibitor zVAD-fmk (zVAD) resulted in hy￾peracute TNFα/zVAD-mediated shock
and accelerated the time to death (28),
necroptosis has been discussed to con￾tribute to this model (27). Finally, under
certain circumstances, RIP1- and RIP3-in￾dependent programmed necrosis has
been demonstrated (29,30).
To inhibit PCD, we generated a protein
that consists of HIV TAT fused to the
cowpox virus protein crmA (31), and
showed that TAT-crmA efficiently blocks
Fas-mediated apoptosis (32). Here, we
demonstrate that TAT-crmA effectively
blocks necroptosis in L929, HT29 and in
FADD-deficient Jurkat cells and that
RIP3-deficient mice are protected from
acute TNFα-mediated and hyperacute
TNFα-zVAD-mediated shock. Conse￾quently, we aimed to improve in vivo
necroptosis models by Nec-1 and TAT￾crmA. Unexpectedly, we found that nei￾ther drug protected the mice, but rather
accelerated the time to death after TNFα￾mediated shock, TNFα/zVAD-mediated
hyperacute shock and deteriorated
cerulein-induced pancreatitis (CIP).
Above that, Nec-1 by itself worsened the
outcome of these models independent of
caspase inhibition. These data highlight
that genetic RIP3-deficiency and RIP1 in￾hibition by Nec-1 application need to be
separated carefully.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents and Antibodies
The zVAD, the ApoAlert annexin V￾FITC antibody α-FADD, α-RIP1 and the
monoclonal α-crmA antibody were pur￾chased from BD Biosciences (Heidel￾berg, Germany). Recombinant mouse
TNFα (carrier-free) and purified 
α-human TNFα were purchased from
BioLegend (Uithoorn, Netherlands). 
The cyclophilin A antibody and the
 caspase-8 antibody were obtained from
Cell Signaling (Frankfurt/Main, Ger￾many). The reagents cycloheximide
(CHX), necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) and
cerulein were obtained from Sigma￾Aldrich (Taufkirchen, Germany).
Cell Culture
Jurkat cells, HT29 adenocarcinoma
cells and L929 fibrosarcoma cells were
originally obtained from ATCC (Manas￾sas, VA, USA). FADD-deficient Jurkat
cells were kindly provided by Dieter
Adam (Institute for Immunology, 
UK-SH Kiel, Germany). Parental and
FADD- deficient Jurkat cells were cul￾tured in RPMI medium supplemented
with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and
 penicillin-streptomycin. HT29 cells were
maintained in minimum essential
 medium with Earle’s salts (Invitrogen,
Darmstadt, Germany), 10% FCS with
glutamine, penicillin-streptomycin,
nonessential amino acids and sodium
pyruvate. L929 cells were cultured in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium
(DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with
10% FCS and penicillin-streptomycin. All
cell lines were cultured in a humidified
5% CO2 atmosphere.
Cloning, Expression and Purification of
Recombinant Proteins
Bacterial expression and purification of
recombinant TAT-crmA and mutated
TAT-crmA (mut.TAT-crmA) fusion pro￾teins were modified slightly from the
previously described procedure (32) and
are described in detail in Supplemental
Information.
Assessment of Cell Death
Phosphatidylserine exposure to the
outer cell membrane was quantified by
annexin V staining followed by fluores￾cence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analy￾sis. Cells were stimulated for 5 h at 37°C
with 100 ng/mL TNFα, 2 μg/mL CHX,
30 μmol/L Nec-1, 25 μmol/L zVAD or
500 nmol/L TAT-crmA as indicated. An￾nexin V-staining was performed accord￾ing to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Fluorescence was analyzed using an
EPICS XL (Beckman Coulter, Krefeld,
Germany) flow cytometer. Data were an￾alyzed using EPICS System II software.
The biomarker cyclophilin A is released
from necroptotic cells. For this, L929 cells
were treated for 7 h at 37°C with the in￾dicated reagents. The supernatants 
(200 μL) were isolated and analyzed by
SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting
using α-CypA antibody, as published
previously (33).
Animals and In Vivo Models
Six- to eight-week old female C57BL/6
mice (average weight approximately
22 g) and 6- to 8-wk old female Balb/c
mice (average weight approximately
20 g) were purchased from Charles River
(Sulzfeld, Germany). Female mice were
used in all experiments unless otherwise
specified. RIP3-deficient mice were de￾scribed previously (14) and were ob￾tained initially from VM Dixit (34). All
mice were kept on a standard diet and a
12 h day–night rhythm. All in vivo exper￾iments were performed according to the
Protection of Animals Act after approval.
In all experiments, mice were carefully
matched for age, sex, weight and genetic
background.
The model of TNFα-induced shock has
been described in detail previously (28).
In our experiments, C57BL/6 mice or
Balb/c mice received intraperitoneal (i.p.)
injections (total volume per mouse was
200 μL) of either vehicle, 10 mg zVAD/kg
body weight, 1.65 mg Nec-1/ kg body
weight, 20 mg TAT-crmA/kg body weight,

DICHOTOMY BETWEEN RIP1- AND RIP3-MEDIATED NECROPTOSIS

20 mg mut.TAT-crmA/kg body weight
or combined reagents as indicated 15 min
prior and 1 h after singular injection of
25 μg murine TNFα in 200 μL PBS via
the tail vein in the identical concentra￾tion, respectively, with the exception of
zVAD, of which 2 mg/kg body weight
was applied at the time of the second in￾jection. Animals were under permanent
observation and survival was checked
every 15 min. In an analogous experi￾ment, all animals (n = 3 per group) were
euthanized 3 h after TNFα injection and
tissue samples were harvested and trans￾ferred to 4% normal-buffered formalin
for histological preparation.
Cerulein-induced pancreatitis (CIP) has
been described elsewhere in detail (16).
Briefly, C57BL/6 mice received i.p. injec￾tions of 50 μg cerulein/kg body weight
once every h for 10 h. Equal volumes 
(150 μL) of vehicle, 10 mg zVAD/ kg
body weight, 1.65 mg Nec-1/kg body
weight or 10 mg TAT-crmA/kg body
weight were injected i.p. 10 min before
cerulein injection. Every 2 h later for 
10 h in total, one fifth of the above men￾tioned concentration was applied in
equal volumes. Animals were eutha￾nized 24 h after the first injection and
samples of blood and tissues were rap￾idly harvested. Quantification of pan￾creas injury was performed by measur￾ing serum amylase and lipase activity.
Whole pancreas organs were excised
and transferred to 4% normal-buffered
formalin for histological preparation.
Overall pancreatic damage scores were
calculated by a pathologist using a 
scale from 0 to 5 with consideration of
these independent parameters: edema
formation, immune cell infiltration, 
tissue necrosis and structural organ 
conservation.
Histology and Immunohistochemistry
Organs were recovered as indicated
and fixated with 4% neutral-buffered
formalin paraffin-embedded. Samples
were sectioned and stained with 
hematoxylin–eosin (HE) or periodic
acid–Schiff (PAS) reagent, respectively,
according to routine protocols and ex￾amined for pathological changes under
an Axio Imager microscope (Zeiss,
Oberkochen, Germany) at 200× (pan￾creas and jejunum) or 400× (kidney)
magnification. High-resolution imaging
was documented using an AxioCam
MRm Rev. 3 FireWire camera and 
AxioVision Rel. 4.5 software (Zeiss, Ger￾many). Organ damage (kidney and pan￾creas) was quantified by a pathologist in
a double-blind manner on a scale rang￾ing from 0 (unaffected tissue) to 10 (se￾vere organ damage).
Statistics
Differences in compared groups were
considered statistically significantly dif￾ferent with P values lower than 0.05 and
were marked with * as calculated with
student t tests. Highly significant differ￾ences were indicated with ** when P <
0.01 and *** when P < 0.001. Calculation
of t tests was performed using the
GraphPad Prism software, version 5.04.

Figure 1. TAT-crmA inhibits both apoptosis and necroptosis in vitro. (A) Jurkat T cells were
left untreated or treated with recombinant human TNFα plus CHX, zVAD and TAT-crmA as
indicated. After 5 h of incubation at 37°C, cells were stained for phosphatidylserine expo￾sure with annexin V-FITC antibody and analyzed by FACS. Presence of zVAD or TAT-crmA
prevented TNFα/CHX-induced apoptotic cell death. (B) L929, HT29 and FADD–/– Jurkat

necroptotic cell death was achieved by the addition of Nec-1 or TAT-crmA. (C) Western
blot of cyclophilin A in the supernatant of L929 cells that were left untreated or treated

RESULTS
TAT-crmA Inhibits TNFα-Mediated
Apoptosis
To induce caspase-dependent TNFR￾mediated extrinsic apoptosis, Jurkat cells
were treated with 100 ng/mL recombi￾nant human TNFα plus 2 μg/mL cyclo￾heximide (CHX), 25 μmol/L of the pan￾caspase inhibitor zVAD and 500 nmol/L
TAT-crmA as indicated. After 5 h of incu￾bation at 37°C, cells were stained for
phosphatidylserine exposure with an￾nexin V-FITC and analyzed by flow cy￾tometry (FACS). The presence of zVAD
or TAT-crmA completely prevented
TNFα/CHX-induced apoptotic cell death
(Figure 1A). In this context, we demon￾strated previously that TAT-crmA pro￾motes a significant reduction of ischemic
myocardial tissue injury (32). Because of
the latter observation and a recent publi￾cation that ascribes a pathophysiologic
impact to both apoptosis and pro￾grammed necrosis in myocardial infarc￾tion (35), we hypothesized that TAT￾crmA, besides blocking apoptosis, also
might interfere with the necroptosis
pathway.
TAT-crmA Inhibits TNFα-Mediated
Necroptosis
To investigate the potential of TAT￾crmA to prevent TNFα-mediated pro￾grammed necrosis, L929, HT29 and
FADD-deficient Jurkat cells, were incu￾bated for 5 h at 37°C with 100 ng/mL re￾combinant TNFα plus 2 μg/mL CHX in
the presence or absence of 25 μmol/L
zVAD, 30 μmol/L of Nec-1 or
500 nmol/L TAT-crmA. Accessibility to
phospha ti dyl serine residues was ana￾lyzed by FACS staining using an annexin
V-FITC antibody. This readout was
demonstrated previously to be appropri￾ate for evaluation of necroptosis in the
presence of Nec-1 (36). As shown in Fig￾ure 1B, the percentage of necroptotic cells
induced by TNFα/CHX in combination
with zVAD was significantly reduced by
the addition of Nec-1 or TAT-crmA. In
FADD-deficient Jurkat cells, the presence
of two independent cell death pathways
was obvious. Blocking TNFα/CHX-
 induced apoptosis with zVAD reduced
the number of annexin V-positive cells
from 48.7% to 24.0%. The existing fraction
of necroptotic cells was rescued to basal
levels by the addition of Nec-1 or TAT￾crmA. TAT-crmA was at least as effective
as Nec-1 in reducing cell death in all
three investigated cell lines. To confirm
this result in an independent second
readout system, we investigated cyclo -
philin A release which was suggested as
a marker for necrotic cell death (33). To
assess cyclophilin A release, L929 cells
were left untreated or treated with
100 ng/mL TNFα + 25 μmol/L zVAD
(TZ), TZ + 30 μmol/L Nec-1, TZ +
500 nmol/L TAT-crmA, and TZ +
500 nmol/L of an inactive mutant of TAT￾crmA (mut.TAT-crmA), respectively, as
indicated for 7 h at 37°C. Supernatants
were harvested and Western blotting was
performed using a cyclophilin A antibody
(Figure 1C). Blockade of necroptosis with
either Nec-1 or TAT-crmA reduced the
amount of cyclophilin A to basal levels in
an equally effective manner whereas the
mut.TAT-crmA did not prevent cy￾clophilin A release. Because of the en￾dogenous TNFα-production of L929 cells
(33,37), we additionally assessed cy￾clophilin A release in the absence of ex￾ogenously added TNFα. As demon￾strated in Figure S1, both Nec-1 and
TAT-crmA reduced the amount of cy￾clophilin A released into the supernatant.
To get mechanistic insights into how
the fusion protein TAT-crmA interferes
with the necroptotic signaling com￾plexes, we analyzed lysates from RIP3-
overexpressing cells for a possible inter￾action with TAT-crmA. As demonstrated
in Figure S2A, TAT-crmA but not
mut.TAT-crmA immunoprecipitated
RIP3. Under identical conditions, no im￾munoprecipitation of RIP1, FADD or
 caspase-8 was detected (Figure S2B).
RIP3-Deficient Mice Are Protected
from TNFα-Mediated Shock and
TNFα/zVAD-Mediated Hyperacute
Shock
In search for a suitable model of
necroptosis to transfer our in vitro data
into an in vivo setting, we evaluated the
well-established mouse models of acute
TNFα-induced and hyperacute TNFα/
zVAD-mediated shock. In the latter,
 caspase-blockade with zVAD combined
with intravenous (i.v.) application of
TNFα leads to accelerated death in wild￾type mice (28). Because mice deficient in
RIP1, the direct target of Nec-1, fail to
thrive and die at d 1 to 3 after birth, we
investigated mice that are genetically defi￾cient for RIP3, an essential component of
the necroptosome. The functional rele￾vance of RIP3 was assessed in both
TNFα-mediated acute and TNFα/zVAD￾mediated hyperacute shock as induced by
treatment with i.v. injection of 25 μg
murine TNFα alone (Figure 2A, n = 8) or
a combination of TNFα and 250 μg zVAD.
The latter was injected i.p. 15 min before
TNFα application (Figure 2B, n = 8) as 
described in Material and Methods.

DICHOTOMY BETWEEN RIP1- AND RIP3-MEDIATED NECROPTOSIS
Figure 2. Genetic deficiency of RIP3 pro￾tects from TNFα-mediated shock in the
presence and absence of caspase inhibi￾tion. Wild-type mice (open circles) and
RIP3-deficient mice (black squares, n = 8
per group) were treated with mouse TNFα
in the absence (A) or presence (B) of
zVAD. Survival is presented as a Kaplan￾Meyer plot. Genetic RIP3-deficiency pro￾tects from both TNFα-mediated shock (P <
0.001) and hyperacute TNFα/zVAD￾mediated shock (P < 0.01), respectively.

RIP3- deficient mice were significantly
protected from both TNFα-induced and
TNFα/zVAD-mediated hyperacute shock
(P = 0.0013 and P < 0.0001, respectively).
In the TNFα-induced shock model, 50%
of RIP3-deficient mice survived the exper￾iment whereas only one RIP3-knockout
(ko) mouse survived the TNFα/zVAD￾mediated hyperacute shock, respectively.
All wild-type mice died within 24 h after
TNFα-injection. In a similar experiment,
male wild-type mice were compared with
male RIP3-ko mice in the TNFα-shock
model with comparable results (data not
shown). Interestingly, the RIP3 pathway
appears to be involved in the TNFα
model wherein it does not require phar￾macological caspase inhibition. These
data highlight that necroptosis by defini￾tion contributes to both of these processes.
The Necroptosis Blockers Nec-1 and
TAT-crmA Accelerate Time to Death
after Hyperacute TNFα/zVAD-Induced
Shock
Given that both Nec-1 and TAT-crmA
are potent blockers of necroptosis in vitro
(Figure 1) and the relevance of RIP3-
 dependent necroptosis in the TNFα/
zVAD-mediated hyperacute shock model
(see Figure 2B), we aimed to apply Nec-1
and TAT-crmA in this model. Mice (n =
7) died after 24.43 ± 3.64 h when treated
with TNFα alone and the addition of
zVAD led to a significantly shorter time
to death (13.50 ± 6.25 h, P < 0.001) (Fig￾ure 3A). However, one mouse survived
the experiment. This finding is consistent
with previously published data (28).
Consequently, we aimed to prolong sur￾vival by adding Nec-1 or TAT-crmA. To
this end, TNFα/zVAD-treated mice re￾ceived two i.p. injections of 1.65 mg
Nec-1/kg body weight or 20 mg TAT￾crmA/kg body weight. The first was
given 15 min before, the second, 1 h after
application of TNFα. Surprisingly, mice
in both groups died significantly earlier
than the TNFα/zVAD-treated mice
(TNFα/zVAD/Nec-1-treated and
TNFα/zVAD/TAT-crmA-treated mice
died after 7.14 ± 3.44 h [P < 0.05] and
9.14 ± 3.24 h [P < 0.05], respectively). In a
separate experiment, we induced hyper￾acute TNFα/zVAD-mediated shock in
identical settings and euthanized the
mice 3 h after TNFα injection and har￾vested organs (heart, lungs, liver, kid￾neys, spleen, thymus and brain). In line
with previously published data (28), the
most pronounced organ damage was ob￾served in the kidneys. Histopathological
PAS staining and renal damage scores
are depicted in Figures 3B and 3C, re￾spectively. Renal tubular damage was
evaluated as published previously (38).
Tubular damage scores were low in the
TNFα-treated group. However, signifi￾cant organ damage developed upon the
addition of zVAD. The most severe dam￾age was observed in kidneys from mice
in which necroptosis was inhibited by
Nec-1 or TAT-crmA, although no statisti￾cally significant difference was observed
between the TNFα/zVAD-treated, the
TNFα/zVAD/Nec-1-treated and the
TNFα/zVAD/TAT-crmA-treated groups
due to high standard deviation (see Fig￾ure 3C). No differences in organ architec￾ture were detected either macroscopi￾cally or in tissue sections of the liver,
lung, pancreas or spleen (data not
shown). Importantly, mice treated with
mut.TAT-crmA did not show any differ￾ences in survival in this setting
(Figure S3). None of the mice that re￾ceived identical doses of Nec-1, zVAD, or
TAT-crmA without TNFα died over a pe￾riod of three months (data not shown).
These results suggest a deteriorating role
for Nec-1 or TAT-crmA during hypera￾cute TNFα/zVAD-mediated shock in yet
undefined cells.

Neither Genetic T-cell Deficiency
in Balb/c nu/nu Mice nor Depletion
of Macrophages, NK Cells or
Granulocytes in Balb/c Mice
Significantly Protect from Rapid Death
after TNFα/zVAD/Nec-1-Mediated
Hyperacute Shock
Given the aforementioned results, we
hypothesized that blocking apoptosis or
necroptosis by Nec-1 or TAT-crmA might
rescue immune cells that might acceler￾ate the pathogenesis of the apparent
shock and harm the general organism.
We targeted T lymphocytes, macro -
phages, natural killer (NK) cells and
granulocytes as candidate cells. To relate
the harmful effect to a defined immune
cell population, we depleted macro -
phages, NK cells and granulocytes in
Balb/c mice employing clodronate, mon￾oclonal antibodies or antisera, as de￾scribed in Material and Methods. Ini￾tially, successful depletion of each cell
type in mice (n = 3) was confirmed by
FACS staining in a separate approach 24
h after i.p. application of the depleting
reagents (Figure S4A–C). Based on these
data, we injected TNFα alone or the
TNFα/ zVAD/Nec-1 (TZN) after deple￾tion and added genetically deficient
nude mice (nu/nu) to the experiment. As
shown in the Kaplan-Meier graph in Fig￾ure S4D, no benefit to overall survival of
TNFα/ zVAD/Nec-1-treated wild type
mice was detected in any of the investi￾gated transgenic or depletion mouse
models (n = 6 in each group, TNFα data
were adopted from the experiment
shown in Figure 3A for better compara￾bility). Administration of liposomes (clo￾dronate carrier) alone did not influence
survival (data not shown).
Necrostatin-1 Accelerates Time to
Death and Worsens Organ Damage
after TNFα-Mediated Shock in the
Absence of Caspase Inhibition
Given that RIP3-deficient mice are pro￾tected not only from TNFα/zVAD-medi￾ated hyperacute shock, but also from
TNFα-induced shock (Figure 2), we in￾vestigated whether a direct blockade of
RIP1 by Nec-1 might influence survival
in the TNFα-induced shock model with￾out caspase inhibition. Interestingly, i.p.
injections of Nec-1 hastened death after
TNFα-induced shock in the absence of
caspase inhibition. All TNFα/Nec-1-
treated animals died significantly earlier
compared with the TNFα-treated mice
(P < 0.001; n = 8 per group, Figure 4A).
Renal damage (Figures 4B, C) was in￾creased significantly by applications of
Nec-1 when compared with mice that re￾ceived TNFα alone. Edema formation is
indicative of the severe vascular leakage
syndrome (VLS) that develops mainly in
the gastrointestinal tract upon TNFα ap￾plication. Consequently, we investigated
TNFα-induced gastrointestinal edema
formation for each group in another in￾dependent experiment. Therefore, mice
were euthanized after 2.5 h and jejunum
was isolated and prepared for HE
 staining. Representative micrographs are
shown in Figure 4D. A marked increase
in gastrointestinal edema formation was
obvious in the TNFα/Nec-1 group when
compared with the vehicle-treated or the
TNFα-treated group. Importantly, an in￾active necrostatin-1 (Nec-1i) did not in￾fluence survival in this setting
(Figure S5). The dose of 25μg TNFα per
mouse was lethal in 100% of mice (see
Figures 2, 3A, 4A). To further study the

circles) or treated intravenously with mouse TNFα alone (black squares) or in addition to
Nec-1 (open triangles). Survival is presented as a Kaplan-Meyer plot (n = 8). (B, C) Three h
after TNFα-injection (basic experimental setting is identical to Figure 3A), mice were euth￾anized and kidneys were harvested and prepared for PAS-staining. Representative sec￾tions are demonstrated and a kidney damage score was used for quantification. (D) In
an independent approach (basic experimental setting is identical to Figure 3A), 2.5 h
after TNFα-injection, mice were euthanized and jejunum was harvested and HE stained.
Representative sections are presented. The arrowhead points to the typical appearance
of edema within the tunica muscularis that was exclusively visible in the TNFα/zVAD/Nec-1
group. Scale bars, 20 μm (B) and 50 μm (D).

deteriorating effect of Nec-1 in TNFα￾mediated shock, we investigated approx￾imately 50% lethal dose (LD50) of TNFα
for shock induction which was achieved
by i.v. application of 9 μg TNFα per
mouse in a separate experiment. In this
setting, all TNFα/Nec-1-treated mice
died within 23 h whereas three of five
TNFα-treated mice survived. (Figure S6,
P < 0.05, n = 5 per group).
Given the presented discrepancy be￾tween RIP3-deficient mice on the one
hand and necroptosis-blockers Nec-1 and
TAT-crmA on the other hand, and the
fact that RIP3-deficient mice are pro￾tected from cerulein-induced pancreatitis
(CIP), we further investigated whether
Nec-1 or TAT-crmA might exert protec￾tive or deteriorating effects in the CIP￾model.
Blocking Apoptosis and Necroptosis
Exacerbates Experimental
Pancreatitis
Data from two independent groups
demonstrated that RIP3-deficient mice
were partially protected from organ
damage in a model of cerulein-induced
pancreatitis (CIP) (16,25). We therefore
analyzed the amount of pancreatic injury
upon blockade of necroptosis with Nec-1
or TAT-crmA. CIP was induced using a
standard protocol (16). Administration of
zVAD, Nec-1, TAT-crmA and the combi￾nation of zVAD and Nec-1 resulted in a
significant increase in the serum concen￾trations of both amylase and lipase 24 h
after the first cerulein injection (Fig￾ures 5A, B). In comparison to zVAD or
Nec-1 administered alone, combined
zVAD/Nec-1 or TAT-crmA treatment led
to significantly higher elevation of these
parameters, suggesting an additive dete￾riorating effect of zVAD and Nec-1. In a
similar experiment, 24 h after the first
cerulein injection, a double-blind evalua￾tion of HE-stained histomicrographs re￾vealed a marked increase in pancreatic
damage scores upon treatment with TAT￾crmA or a combination of zVAD and
Nec-1, whereas the single components
zVAD and Nec-1 did not lead to in￾creased organ damage when compared
with vehicle-treated mice (Figures 5C, D).
The reagents zVAD, Nec-1 or TAT-crmA
alone, without cerulein, exhibited no ef￾fects on serum concentrations of amylase
and lipase (data not shown). In identical
settings, mice were observed for 8 wk
after CIP-induction to exclude lethality.
In this experiment, serum parameters re￾turned to basal levels by the end of the
first week (data not shown, n = 5). RIP3
deficient mice have been investigated in
this setting previously by two other
groups (16,25). Unlike Nec-1, and as ex￾pected from the above presented results
concerning the TNFα- mediated shock
model, RIP3-deficiency did not deterio￾rate the course of experimental pancre￾atitis in our study (data not shown).
These experiments suggest an additive
deteriorating effect of both zVAD and
Nec-1 in CIP that appears to be repro￾duced by the application of TAT-crmA
and demonstrate the dichotomy between
RIP1- and RIP3-mediated necroptosis in
a second, independent setting.
DISCUSSION
The crucial role of apoptosis in the
control of certain viral infections be￾comes obvious with the number of vi￾rally expressed apoptosis inhibitors that
target caspases (29,39–41). Viruses are
easily cleared from the host organism if
they are unable to respond to extrinsic
apoptosis, mediated by the Fas signaling
pathway (9). Among the range of viral
apoptosis inhibitors, the cowpox virus
protein crmA has been of outstanding in￾terest because of its high affinity to the
initiator caspase-8 (31). It is comprehensi￾ble that under evolutionary pressure, ad￾ditional host defense mechanisms have
emerged, including necroptosis for the
rapid removal of virally infected cells
that are unresponsive to conventional
apoptotic signals (11,18). Interestingly,
crmA efficiently blocks the caspase-8 ho￾modimer that is responsible for the exe￾cution of apoptosis, whereas the caspase￾8/FLIPL heterodimer, which executes
non-apoptotic functions, especially RIP1
inactivation, is affected by crmA only in
higher doses (14).

Figure 5. Blocking necroptosis deteriorates
acute experimental pancreatitis. Cerulein￾induced pancreatitis mice were left un￾treated or given i.p. injections of cerulein
once every hour for 10 h. In addition to
every second injection of cerulein, either
vehicle or zVAD, Nec-1 and TAT-crmA were
injected as indicated. 14 h after the last in￾jection mice were sacrificed and blood
samples were taken. Levels of serum amy￾lase (A) and serum lipase (B) are shown
for each group as indicated. In parallel,
pancreatic tissue samples were harvested.
Representative sections are demonstrated
in C, and a pancreatic damage score
was used for quantification (D) (n = 5, * P <
0.05, ** P < 0.02). Scale bar, 50 μm.

Apoptosis has been demonstrated to
be involved pathophysiologically in di￾verse diseases and targeting caspases
has proven to be of therapeutic interest
(32,42). Concerning PN cascades, evi￾dence is accumulating that the RIP1 inhi￾bition by Nec-1 also is of therapeutic
value (21,22). Additionally, PN has been
shown to be of importance in myocardial
infarction and renal ischemia-reperfusion
injury (23,35,43), although the intercon￾nectivity of these pathways remains to be
determined. We speculated that PCD
pathways that may have emerged to de￾fend microbes turn against the organism
in ischemic, toxic or septic emergency sit￾uations (6). This hypothesis gave rise to
our approach to interfering with PCD
pathways by providing a viral PCD in￾hibitor, a directly active protein, into the
vasculature of the involved organs. Im￾portantly, the TAT-domain of HIV as￾sures the delivery of the attached crmA
into all somatic cells and can cross
through the blood brain barrier (our un￾published observation). Unaware of the
number of signaling pathways with
which TAT-crmA interferes, we initially
aimed to inhibit apoptosis in the murine
model of myocardial infarction and
demonstrated a noticeable protective ef￾fect (32). Moreover, others have demon￾strated the pathophysiological impor￾tance of PN in myocardial infarction (35),
and this prompted us to investigate the
direct influence of TAT-crmA on PN. In￾deed, the fusion protein inhibits necro -
ptotic signaling (see Figure 1), whereas
crmA overexpression does not (4). This
discrepancy remains unexplained. We
cannot exclude the possibility that the
TAT-domain, perhaps guided toward the
DISC by the high affinity of crmA to
 caspase-8, interferes with the frail assem￾bly of complex IIa and/or complex IIb.
Another possible explanation arises from
the recently published observation that
crmA strongly inhibits the caspase-8 ho￾modimer which leads to cell death, but
leaves the RIP1-deactivating caspase-8/
FLIPL heterodimer almost unaffected in
physiological concentrations (14). Upon
overexpression, crmA concentrations
might reach a level where the hetero -
dimer also is completely blocked, there -
by opening the gates for execution of
necroptosis. However, TAT-crmA blocks
both extrinsic apoptosis and necroptosis,
comparable to the combination of zVAD
and Nec-1, and additionally inhibits the
intrinsic pathway (32). Those data led us
to investigate the well-established model
of TNFα/zVAD-induced hyperacute
shock. As expected, RIP3-deficient mice
are protected from TNFα/zVAD-
 mediated hyperacute shock. Conse￾quently, we aimed to overcome the pre￾viously published deteriorating effect of
zVAD (28) by addition of necroptosis
blockers in wild-type mice. With regard
to caspase inhibition by zVAD, our data
are in line with this report, albeit the
TNFα/zVAD-treated mice died at some￾what later time points. Unexpectedly, the
additional blockade of necroptosis with
either Nec-1 or TAT-crmA did not pro￾vide protection, but rather accelerated
the time to death (Figure 3). From a clini￾cal point of view, this result is disap￾pointing because Nec-1 or TAT-crmA had
been predicted as promising candidates
for the treatment of septic shock. We fur￾ther examined whether this effect was
due to the prevention of necroptosis in
certain immune cells that could have
continued to respond to TNFα by releas￾ing increasing amounts of proinflamma￾tory cytokines, which thereby might
have harmed the general organism in￾stead of undergoing PCD, and which
might be an effect that is not observed in
RIP3-deficient mice because of compen￾satory mechanisms. Indeed, ex vivo anal￾ysis of neutrophils taken from intensive
care patients concluded that prevention
of cell death on cellular level results in
earlier death of the individual patient
(44). In contrast, the prevention of lym￾phocyte death improved survival in a
murine sepsis model (45). However, de￾pletion of macrophages, NK cells, granu￾locytes and the administration of
TNFα/zVAD/Nec-1 to Balb/c and T-cell
deficient mice disproved this hypothesis
(Figure S2). It should be mentioned that
we cannot formally rule out the possibil￾ity of crmA-mediated interference with
other caspases or granzyme B (31,46),
but such interaction should not influence
the results observed with Nec-1. Impor￾tantly, RIP3-deficient mice also are pro￾tected from TNFα-mediated shock in the
absence of caspase inhibitors (see Fig￾ure 2A). Taken together, these results
were surprising because the common
concept of necroptosis would have fa￾vored application of Nec-1 to be in line
with genetic RIP-3 deficiency rather than
establishing a dichotomy between the
two. Therefore, we investigated the con￾sequences of necroptosis inhibition in
cerulein-induced pancreatitis which was
among the first in vivo models that
proved the clinical relevance of RIP3-
 mediated necroptosis (16,25). Interest￾ingly, similar to the TNFα/zVAD-
 mediated hyperacute shock, the blockade
of necroptosis led to the exacerbation of
the CIP model (Figure 5). Therefore, two
in vivo models demonstrate the impor￾tance of separating genetic RIP3-defi￾ciency from pharmacologically blocking
necro ptosis. Inhibition of RIP1 by Nec-1
cannot be equated with the genetic defi￾ciency of RIP3. Apparently, these closely
related proteins exhibit different regula￾tory potentials in vivo. Therefore, it will
be of interest to see a direct comparison
of Nec-1-treatment versus RIP3 deficiency
in vaccinia virus-infected mice (18) and
other in vivo models of necroptosis such
as the recently published cecal ligation
and puncture (CLP) model (47). The lat￾ter paper is in line with our data con￾cerning the RIP3-deficient mice, but is in
contrast to the results concerning Nec-1
in the TNF-shock model, which might be
explained by different concentrations of
Nec-1, the different age of the mice or the
preparation of the recombinant TNFα
used in that study (47).
According to the common concept of
TNFα-mediated PCD, complex IIa signals
to initiate apoptosis, including the activa￾tion of caspase-8. Active caspase-8/FLIPL
heterodimers cleave and inactivate RIP1,
thereby preventing necro ptotic signaling
(10,12). However, recent data from stud￾ies on photoreceptors suggests that
584 | LINKERMANN ET AL. | MOL MED 18:577-586, 2012
DICHOTOMY BETWEEN RIP1- AND RIP3-MEDIATED NECROPTOSIS

necroptosis and apoptosis might not be
mutually exclusive (21). Our in vitro data
concerning HT29 cells and especially
FADD-deficient Jurkat cells (see Figure 1)
might be interpreted in line with those
data. To further clarify this hypothesis 
we investigated the effect of Nec-1 in 
the absence of caspase inhibition. We
demonstrate the deterioration of TNFα￾mediated organ failure by application of
Nec-1 at standard and low concentrations
of TNFα without the inhibition of cas￾pases. Given that Nec-1 is called a highly
specific RIP-1 inhibitor that is even used
to define necroptosis (27,48,49), our data
suggest direct necro ptotic signaling
downstream of the TNFR in the absence
of caspase inhibition in vivo. Importantly,
Nec-1 alone, even applied at high plasma
concentrations, did not affect survival in
the absence of TNFα (data not shown). In
TNFα-mediated shock, the comparison of
caspase inhibition by zVAD and RIP1 in￾hibition by Nec-1 resulted in comparable
median survival, but the standard devia￾tion in Nec-1-treated animals was lower.
One possible explanation for this phe￾nomenon is the strict inhibition of only
one protein by Nec-1, whereas zVAD in￾terferes with multiple complexes and del￾icate signaling conglomerates (50) that
may result in a larger standard deviation
in vivo.
Protection from both TNFα-mediated
shock and TNFα/zVAD-mediated hyper￾acute shock in RIP3-deficient mice as
well as the previously described protec￾tion in the CIP model suggest that phar￾macological inhibition of RIP3 might be
of clinical interest. Nec-1 failed to protect
in these models, indicating that inhibi￾tion of the RIP1/RIP3-pathway must be
performed on the level of RIP3 or further
downstream.
Results obtained from ischemic my￾ocardium and hypoxic brain injury sug￾gest the pathophysiological presence of
both mentioned PCD components
(20,21), but other data accumulate for the
functional predominance of PN in this
setting (51). The principle difference be￾tween models of ischemia/reperfusion
(I/R) and those of CIP and hyperacute
TNFα-mediated shock is that I/R-models
are improved by Nec-1.
CONCLUSION
Taken together, our data outline the
importance to separate genetic RIP3-
 deficiency from Nec-1 application. TAT￾crmA provides a powerful tool for the
 inhibition of intrinsic and extrinsic apo￾ptosis and necroptosis. The fact that
Nec-1 and TAT-crmA accelerate disease
progression in both CIP and TNFα-
 mediated shock is disappointing concern￾ing the therapeutic potential of inhibitors
of necroptosis. Because various diseases
pathophysiologically involve necroptosis,
phase 1 clinical trials employing Nec-1
have actually been announced. The need
for therapeutic approaches to treat debili￾tating diseases is obvious. However, aim￾ing to provide the extraordinary potential
of Nec-1 or TAT-crmA to patients requires
attention, especially in the case of acute
inflammation.
