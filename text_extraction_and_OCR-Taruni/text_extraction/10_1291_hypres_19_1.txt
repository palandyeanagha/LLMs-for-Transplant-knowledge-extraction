Mechanism of Glucocorticoid -Induced Hypertension
Takao Saruta
Despite many previous studies, the mechanism of glucocorticoid-induced hypertension remains un￾known. The present review will introduce the results of our studies on this subject in patients with 
Cushing's syndrome and in experimemtal animals. Our studies indicate that the following multiple fac￾tors are involved in glucocorticoid-induced hypertension in humans and animals: 1) activation of the 
renin-angiotensin (R-A) system due to an increase in plasma renin substrate (PRS); 2) reduced activity 
of depressor systems, including the kallikrein-kinin (K-K) system, prostaglandins (PGs), and the 
endothelium-derived relaxing factor nitric oxide (NO); and 3) increased pressor responses to angiotensin 
II (Ang II) and norepinephrine. Furthermore, our in vitro studies have revealed that the number of 
Ang II type 1 receptors of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) is significantly increased by glucocorti￾coids. It is concluded that the pathogenesis of glucocorticoid-induced hypertension is multi-factorial, in￾volving the various mechanisms described above. (Hypertens Res 1996; 19: 1-8)

As exemplified by Cushing's syndrome, an excess of 
glucocorticoids can cause hypertension (1). Howev￾er, the pathogenesis of glucocorticoid-induced 
hypertension remains undetermined, although the 
involvement of multiple factors has been suggested 
(2, 3). Over the past several years, our group has 
performed a series of investigations on this subject 
in patients with Cushing's syndrome as well in ex￾perimental animals (rats and dogs) given glucocorti￾coids.
 Characteristics of Hypertension in 
 Cushing's Syndrome 
Hypertension induced by glucocorticoid excess, as 
seen in Cushing's syndrome, is characterized by: 1) 
activation of the renin-angiotensin (R-A) system 
due to an increase in plasma renin substrate (PRS), 
2) reduced activity of depressor systems such as the 
kallikrein-kinin (K-K) system and prostaglandins 
(PGs), and 3) enhanced pressor responses to nor￾epinephrine and angiotensin II (Ang II). These 
effects are illustrated in Fig. 1 through 4, which 
show data obtained from 12 patients with Cushing's 
syndrome (5 men and 7 women; age, 19-65 years), 
as compared with data from 6 normal control sub￾jects (3 men and 3 women; mean age, 31 years). 
Both the patients with Cushing's syndrome and the 
control subjects were admitted to Keio University 
Hospital for the study. They were given a regular 
diet providing 12 g of salt per d. On the morning of 
the 4th hospital day, blood samples were drawn for 
the determination of plasma renin activity (PRA),
PRS, plasma renin concentration (PRC), plasma 
aldosterone concentration (PAC), plasma cortisol 
(PC), and electrolytes. During the following 24 
hours, urine was collected for the measurement of 
urinary PGE2 and kallikrein excretion. Pressor re￾sponses to Ang II and norepinephrine were ex￾amined during infusion of graded concentrations. 
Blood pressure was monitored continously during 
the infusion using an automated blood pressure 
monitor (Nippon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan). Ang II 
(Ciba Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo, Japan) was dis￾sloved in 5% glucose solution and was infused in￾travenously for 10 minutes at each of the following 
graded concentrations: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 ng/kg per 
min. Norepinephrine (Eisai Pharmaceutical Co., 
Tokyo, Japan), also dissolved in 5% glucose solu￾tion, was infused similarly at 0.01, 0.03, 0.07, 0.11 
and 0.18 pg/kg per min. 
In addition, the effect of an anti-mineralocorti￾coid drug, spironolactone, was studied in patients 
with Cushing's syndrome. Unlike patients with 
primary aldosteronism, the administration of 100 
mg per d of spironolactone for 7 days did not re￾duce blood pressure significantly in patients with 
Cushing's syndrome (Fig. 5).
 Glucocorticoid-Induced Hypertension in Rats 
Three mg/kg per day of dexamethasone (DEX), a 
potent synthetic glucocorticoid, was administered to 
Wistar male rats (body weight, 175-205 g), with and 
without salt loading. As shown in Fig. 6, systolic 
blood pressure rose significantly within 3 days after

initiating DEX administration, but this effect o 
DEX on blood pressure was not augmented by the 
concurrent use of 1 % saline solution in place o 
normal drinking water (4). 
The administration of DEX resulted in a market 
decrease in the urinary excretion of kallikrein am 
of PGE2, while PRA did not change significantly 
The pressor response to norepinephrine was en 
hanced on the 2nd day of DEX administration, a 
which time blood pressure was still unaltered. The 
pressor response to norepinephrine was further aug 
mented on the 6th day of DEX treatment.
 Glucocorticoid-Induced Hypertension in Dogs 
A series of experiments were carried out in dogs tc 
examine the effects of DEX administration of 
blood pressure and on various hemodynamic am
hormonal variables. As shown in Fig. 7, a high dose 
of DEX, i.e., 0.5 mg/kg per d, induced an abrupt 
rise in mean arterial pressure (MAP) on day 1 in 
the conscious dogs, followed by a further gradual 
elevation of MAP, peaking on day 7 (5). The car￾Fig. 5. Antihypertensive effects of spironolactone (100 mg/d)

iliac output decreased and the total peripheral re￾sistance increased significantly, although both urine 
volume and urinary sodium excretion increased 
(Fig. 8). Serial observations of hormones revealed 
that PRA and PAC remained unchanged, PC and 
AVP were significantly reduced, and plasma levels 
of atrial natiuretic peptide (ANP) rose significantly 
(Fig. 9). Urinary excretion of kallikrein, PGE2, and 
6-keto PGF1 was significantly reduced in the group 
given high-dose DEX (Fig. 10). 
To confirm that reduced levels of depressor sub￾stances such as kallikrein and PGs are involved in 
the development of glucocorticoid-induced hyper￾tension, depressor effects of exogenous bradykinin 
and PGI2 in animals with glucocorticoid-induced 
hypertension were studied. 
As shown in Fig. 11, the administration of brady￾kinin at 0.5 ,ag/kg per min reduced MAP by 25±5 
mmHg in the animals given high-dose DEX, but 
not in those given low-dose DEX. Likewise, the 
administration of PGI2 at 2.0 ,ug/kg per min re￾duced MAP by 14 ± 3 mmHg in the dogs given 
high-dose DEX, but not in those given low-dose 
DEX (6). On the other hand, the bradykinin an￾tagonist D-Arg-(Hyp3, Thi5'8, D-Phe')-bradykinin,
given as a bolus injection of 200 pg/kg, elevated 
MAP significantly in the dogs receiving low-dose 
DEX, but not in those receiving high-dose DEX. 
Thus, our study in conscious dogs showed that a 
high dose of DEX elevated blood pressure in asso￾ciation with an increase in total peripheral resist￾ance. This latter effect may result from activation of 
the R-A system as well as the reduced production 
of depressor substances such as kallikrein and PGs. 
It should be noted that the rise in blood pressure 
ensued despite an increase in urinary sodium excre￾tion, which probably occurred due to increased 
ANP production. 
 In Vitro Studies Using Rat Vascular 
 Smooth Muscle Cells 
In order to elucidate the mechanism of increased 
pressor responses to vasoactive substances such as 
Ang II and norepinephrine in glucocorticoid-in￾duced hypertension, we studied the effects of a glu￾cocorticoid on cultured VSMCs. Contraction of 
VSMCs requires an increase in cytosolic calcium 
concentration, which in turn is mediated by inositol￾phosphate-specific phospholipase C activation. We

vaso￾pro￾when VSMCs prepared from the thoracic aorta 
of wistar-Kyoto rats were stimulated by 10-10 to 
10-6 M of Ang II, IP3 was produced in a dose-de￾pendent manner. Pretreatment with 1 pM of DEX f
or 48 hours shifted the dose-response curve to the 
left, as shown in Fig. 12 (7). This effect of DEX re￾quired at least 12 hours of incubation to become 
manifest and was maximum when incubation was 
prolonged to 24 hours. This enhancement by DEX 
of Ang II-induced IP3 production was completely 
blocked by RU-38486, which is a glucocorticoid￾receptor-specific antagonist, indicating that this 
effect was exerted via glucocorticoid-specific recep￾tors (Fig. 13). 
The mechanism by which DEX stimulates Ang II￾induced IP3 production by VSMCs was investigated 
further by studying the changes in the number and 
the affinity of Ang II type 1 receptors. The number 
of Ang II type 1 receptors of VSMCs, measured us￾ing the radio-labeled ligand 1251-Ang II, was un￾changed during the first several hours of exposure 
of the cells to DEX. However, the receptor number 
increased after 12 hours of exposure. The number 
of the receptors continued to increase subsequently, 
reaching a level equivalent to 185 ±9.8% of control 
at 48 hours. Figure 14 shows typical binding pat￾terns of the DEX-treated and control cells at 48 
hours. The Bmax value was 27 ± 3 fmol/mg protein 
in the DEX-treated cells and 15 ± 3 fmol/mg protein 
in the control cells. The Kd of 1251-Ang II did not 
change significantly, the Kd of the DEX-treated 
cells being 1.2 ± 0.3 nmol/l and that of the control 
cells 1.1 ± 0.2 nmol/l. Furthermore, VSMCs treated 
with different concentrations of DEX exhibited a 
dose-dependent increase in the number of Ang II 
type I receptors (Fig. 15). This effect of DEX on 
Ang II type I receptors was completely inhibited by 
RU-38486, a glucocorticoid-receptor-specific antag￾onist. 
In addition to the above studies, the steady-state 
level of the Ang II type I receptor mRNA was mea￾sured by Northern blot analysis. Figure 16 shows

oxide (NO) production has been implicated in 
several types of hypertension (9,10) . 
In our in vitro studies using VSMCs, DEX signif￾icantly inhibited NO production induced by tumor 
necrosis factor plus bacterial. lipopolysaccaride (11). 
We therefore determined the urinary excretion of 
nitrite and nitrate, which are the metabolites of 
NO, in patients with essential hypertension, in one 
patient with primary aldosteronism, and in one pa￾tient with Cushing's syndrome, both before and af￾ter administration of L-arginine. The control urinary 
excretion of nitrite and nitrate was significantly less 
in the patient with Cushing's syndrome than in the 
other patients. Infusion of L-arginine increased urin￾ary excretion of nitrite and nitrate in all of the sub￾jects studied. However, the production rate of NO, 
predicted from urinary nitrite and nitrate excretion 
rates, in the patient with Cushing's syndrome was 
significantly less than in the other patients (Table 
1). 
Our studies indicate that induction of hyperten￾sion by glucocorticoid excess occurs independently 
of the level of salt intake. It was further suggested 
that the following factors are involved in the 
pathogenesis of glucocorticoid-induced hyperten￾sion: 1) suppression of depressor systems, including 
the K-K system, PGs, and NO; 2) alteration of the 
R-A system due to increased PRS; and 3) aug￾mented pressor response to humoral substances due 
to an increased number of receptors such as Ang II 
type I receptor.
