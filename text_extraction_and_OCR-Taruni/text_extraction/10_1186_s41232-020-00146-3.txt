Abstract
The newly emerging coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in Wuhan, China, but has rapidly spread all over the world. Some COVID-19
patients encounter a severe symptom of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with high mortality. This high
severity is dependent on a cytokine storm, most likely induced by the interleukin-6 (IL-6) amplifier, which is hyper￾activation machinery that regulates the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway and stimulated by the simultaneous
activation of IL-6-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and NF-κB signaling in non-immune cells
including alveolar epithelial cells and endothelial cells. We hypothesize that IL-6-STAT3 signaling is a promising
therapeutic target for the cytokine storm in COVID-19, because IL-6 is a major STAT3 stimulator, particularly during
inflammation. We herein review the pathogenic mechanism and potential therapeutic targets of ARDS in COVID-19
patients.
Background
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused
by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2), has globally spread to an ongoing pan￾demic since the first case of infection was reported in
2019. Patients with poor prognostic features upon hos￾pital admission frequently encounter complications with
significant mortality, particularly by acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS) with a broad spectrum of dis￾eases such as multiorgan failure, and blood clots [1]. No
effective vaccine strategy or approved medication for the
treatment of this contagious disease has been estab￾lished, although clinical trials are intensively being per￾formed (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/who_table).
Accumulating evidence suggests that the severity of
COVID-19 is associated with an increased level of in￾flammatory mediators including cytokines and
chemokines such as interleukin (IL)-2, IL-7, IL-10,
tumor necrosis factor (TNF), granulocyte colony￾stimulating factor (G-CSF), monocyte chemoattractant
protein-1 (MCP1; also known as CCL2), macrophage in￾flammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP1α; also known as
CCL3), CXC-chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10), C-reactive
protein, ferritin, and D-dimers in blood upon SARS￾CoV-2 infection [2–10]. Of note, among the elevated in￾flammatory mediators, the blood IL-6 level is highly cor￾related with the disease mortality when COVID-19
survivors and non-survivors are compared [1, 11], sug￾gesting that fatal COVID-19 is characterized as a cyto￾kine release syndrome (CRS) that is induced by a
cytokine storm with high mortality [12–14]. Thus, IL-6
serves as a possible mechanism of treatment for severe
COVID-19 patients, raising the possibility that one
therapeutic option for the disease may be targeting ex￾cessive inflammation caused by IL-6 receptor (IL-6R)
signaling with monoclonal antibody therapy or treat￾ment with chemical modulators to block the signaling
cascade while maintaining a sufficient antiviral primary
immune response. In this regard, the use of two clinic￾ally approved IL-6R antagonists, tocilizumab (TCZ) and

sarilumab (SAR), which are currently used for the treat￾ment of rheumatoid arthritis, could be expected to play
a crucial part in the treatment for severely ill patients.
With this in mind, here we discuss the potential patho￾genetic mechanisms and therapeutic options for
COVID-19, focusing on IL-6-signal transducer and acti￾vator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling.
Viral entry of SARS-CoV-2
Within the past two decades, severe respiratory diseases
were caused by zoonotic infections of SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV from animals to humans in endemic areas.
In late December 2019 in Wuhan City, China, SARS￾CoV-2, belonging to the novel RNA Betacoronavirus,
was discovered as a causative agent of COVID-19, which
has currently become a worldwide pandemic. Genomic
analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 shares about 80%
genetic identity with SARS-CoV, around 50% with
MERS-CoV, and around 90% with bat-SL-CoVZC45 and
bat-SL-CoVZXC21 coronaviruses, suggesting bat-to￾human zoonotic transmission of this new virus [15, 16].
Furthermore, proteomic characterization also showed
that SARS-CoV-2 has seven conserved non-structural
domains similar to SARS-CoV, suggesting a relationship
between the two Betacoronaviruses. Despite amino acid
differences with SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 has a similar
receptor-binding domain to that of SARS-CoV by utiliz￾ing angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) for host
cell entry (Fig. 1) [17, 18]. In fact, two independent re￾search groups have provided evidence that SARS-CoV-2
requires ACE2 to infect host cells [16, 19)]. Zhou et al.
revealed that SARS-CoV-2 can enter cells expressing
ACE2 originated from humans, Chinese horseshoe bats,
civet, and pigs [16]. Also, it cannot enter cells expressing
either dipeptidyl peptidase 4 or aminopeptidase N, the
entry receptors for MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E, re￾spectively. SARS-CoV-2 entry via human ACE2 is
dependent on transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPR
SS2) and the endosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin B
and L (CatB/L) for viral spike (S) protein priming [19].
TMPRSS2 is necessary for cleaving the viral envelope￾located trimeric S protein at the S1/S2 and the S2’ sites,
leading to the fusion of the viral and cellular membranes
mediated by the S2 subunit of S protein after the
Fig. 1 IL-6-STAT3 signaling is a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19 mediated by cytokine storm. SARS-CoV-2 enters cells via cell membrane￾localized ACE2 depending on TMPRSS2 and CatB/L activities for viral S protein priming. The viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns trigger
IL-6 production followed by activation of the NF-κB pathway via PRRs in both immune and non-immune cells, leading to an inflammatory
response. On the other hand, upon the occupancy of ACE2 by SARS-CoV-2, the increased serum level of free Ang II due to a reduction of ACE2-
mediated degradation also promotes activation of the NF-κB pathway via AT1R, followed by IL-6 production. Simultaneously, Ang II-AT1R
signaling activates ADAM17 and ADAM10 protease activity, and the resulting production of TNF-α, sIL-6Rα, and EGF initiates the TNFR-NF-κB, IL￾6R-STAT3, and EGF-NF-κB signaling pathways. Consequently, the concomitant inflammatory cascades of NF-κB- and STAT3-mediated signaling
further augment NF-κB activity and establish an inflammatory circuit, the IL-6 amplifier (IL-6 AMP), which describes an IL-6-based positive
feedback loop for inflammation in non-immune cells. Thus, the cytokine storm caused by the hyper-activation of NF-κB in IL-6 AMP may cause
fatal symptoms such as ARDS, severe pneumonia, multiorgan failure, and coagulation in a subgroup of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. In line
with this, the blockade of IL-6-STAT3 signaling should shed light on the treatment of severe COVID-19

engagement of the S1 subunit to the cell surface recep￾tor and for the subsequent viral internalization in the
pulmonary epithelium [19]. Notably, ammonium chlor￾ide, an inhibitor of CatB/L, inhibited SARS-CoV-2-S
protein-driven entry into 293 T cells (TMPRSS2-nega￾tive) expressing ACE2, but less so into Caco-2 cells
(TMPRSS2-positive). A clinically proven TMPRSS2 in￾hibitor, camostat mesylate (NCT04321096), which is ap￾proved for clinical use in Japan to treat pancreatic
inflammation, partially prevented SARS-CoV-2-driven
entry into Caco-2 cells, but together with E-64d, an inhibi￾tor of CatB/L completely inhibited the entry. In addition,
the forced expression of TMPRSS2 rescued the SARS￾CoV-2-S-dependent entry into CatB/L-suppressed 293 T
cells, suggesting that the entry of SARS-CoV-2 is induced
when cells express TMPRSS2 regardless of CatB/L expres￾sion and that SARS-CoV-2 cell entry depends on surface
ACE2 and TMPRSS2 molecules. Thus, ACE2 and TMPR
SS2 could be predominant targets for COVID-19 therapeu￾tics. Of note, despite the genetic identity of the receptor￾binding domain (RBD) structure between SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2, several reports have shown anti-RBD mono￾clonal antibodies cannot neutralize SARS-CoV-2 [20, 21],
suggesting that cross-neutralization protection between the
two viruses is limited. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 can infect
cells that have Fc receptors (FcRs), which provide the ability
of antibody-mediated internalization in macrophages,
monocytes, or B cells even without ACE2 and TMPRSS2
expression particularly during the later time point after in￾fection [22].
Hyper inflammatory pathogenesis of COVID-19
Among coronaviruses in humans, HCoV-229E, HCoV￾NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1 cause mild cold
symptoms upon infection in the upper respiratory tract
[23]. On the other hand, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and
MERS-CoV cause fatal pneumonia in some cases after
replicating in the lower respiratory tract. Following the
infection of SARS-CoV-2 in patients, symptoms occur
within 5–6 days when the viral load reaches a peak, and
97.5% of symptomatic patients further develop COVID￾19 within 2 weeks [2, 7, 9, 24–26]. Similar to SARS- and
MERS-CoV-induced symptoms, a subgroup of patients
admitted to hospitals exhibit severe respiratory failure
with dyspnea as observed in chest CT scans, bilateral
lung infiltration, lymphopenia, muscle/joint pain, head￾ache/dizziness, diarrhea, nausea, and coughing up of
blood [3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 27–29]. Notably, severe COVID-19
is associated with mortality and poor prognostic features
even when patients are hospitalized [30]. The wide
spectrum of the disease severity for these hospitalized
patients includes not only pneumonia, severe damage to
the airways, and pulmonary edema, but also ARDS,
which is a causative syndrome of death in 70% of fatal
COVID-19 cases, in which aggressive inflammatory re￾sponses occur [6, 31].
Upon viral infection, alveolar epithelial cells, macro￾phages, and blood circulating monocytes are activated
via toll-like receptors as pattern recognition receptors
(PRRs) by the virus products and produce a robust
amount of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines,
which attract more immune cells, in particular, mono￾cytes and T cells, resulting in widespread lung inflamma￾tion (Fig. 1). The postmortem pathology of COVID-19
patients shows interstitial mononuclear inflammatory in￾filtrates dominated by lymphocytes in the lung and severe
lymphopenia with hyperactivated T cells in the peripheral
blood [32]. Furthermore, COVID-19 patients also have
lower levels of regulatory T cells, which are more obvi￾ously decreased in severe cases [33]. Hospitalized patients
with severe COVID-19 show high levels of IL-2, IL-7, IL￾10, G-CSF, TNF, CXCL10, MCP1, and MIP1α in serum
[6], suggesting that severe COVID-19 is dictated as a cyto￾kine release syndrome (CRS), which is a disorder induced
by cytokine storms [12–14]. Among the elevated levels of
inflammatory mediators in COVID-19 patients, the blood
levels of IL-6 are noticeably higher in non-survivors com￾pared to survivors [1, 2, 11, 34] and predict the need for
mechanical ventilation [35].
These findings have led to the hypothesis that the main
cause of death of COVID-19 is ARDS with cytokine storms.
Notably, intravascular coagulation is one of the causes of
multiorgan injury, which is mainly mediated by inflamma￾tory cytokines, in particular, IL-6 [36–38]. Patients exhibit
multiorgan failure with coagulation abnormalities repre￾sented by lower platelets count and increased D-dimer,
which are increasingly associated with poor prognosis and
explain the microthrombi of the lungs, lower limbs, hands,
brain, heart, liver, and kidneys [39–42]. Similar observations
are seen in most patients with SARS-CoV infection who pro￾gressed to renal failure [2, 43]. Another reason of multiorgan
failure is that SARS-CoV-2 infection in endothelial cells also
causes cell death, which leads to vascular leakage and in￾duces a cytopathic effect on airway epithelial cells [44].
Thus, it would seem that the disease severity or mor￾tality comes from cytokine storms including ARDS trig￾gered by viral lung infection, which accounts for
multiorgan failure across the body [45]. These inflamma￾tory mediators can also lead to vascular hyperpermeabil￾ity and stimulate endothelial cells that express ACE2 on
arteries and veins that together with viral particles cause
systemic inflammation [46, 47].

epithelial cells and endothelial cells, resulting in an in￾crease of serum angiotensin II (Ang II) levels due to the
reduction of ACE2 surface expression (Fig. 1) [17, 48].
Ang II increment is also obtained in lung-injury models,
in which ACE2 is dramatically reduced upon acid treat￾ment [49]. Ang II acts not only as a vasoconstrictor but
also as a pro-inflammatory cytokine via Ang II type 1 re￾ceptor (AT1R) [50]. Therefore, it is hypothesized that a
renin-angiotensin system (RAS) may be involved in the
ARDS development following SARS-CoV-2 infection
[12]. In fact, treating mice with AT1R inhibitors or ex￾ogenous recombinant ACE2 suppresses ARDS develop￾ment induced by SARS-CoV infection [17]. In addition,
a possible benefit of RAS inhibitors in COVID-19 pa￾tients has been reported [51–53]. The Ang II-AT1R sig￾naling axis activates ADAM metallopeptidase domain 17
(ADAM17), which in turn digests the membrane forms
of epidermal growth factor family members (EGF, epire￾gulin, amphiregulin, transforming growth factor-alpha,
etc.) and TNF-α, all of which stimulate the NF-κB path￾way (Fig. 1) [12, 50, 54]. ADAM17 is also an enzyme
that processes membrane-bound IL-6Rα to the soluble
form (sIL-6Rα) together with ADAM10. Therefore, we
hypothesize serum Ang II and sIL-6Rα might be predict￾ive markers of COVID-19 severity.
Once sIL-6Rα is generated, the sIL-6R-IL-6 complex
transduces intracellular signaling via its binding to
gp130, a signal transducer of IL-6, which is expressed on
non-immune cells including endothelial cells, epithelial
cells, and fibroblasts even without membrane IL-6R ex￾pression, followed by the activation of Janus kinase
(JAK)/STAT3 [55]. Thus, Ang II-AT1R signaling can
create an IL-6-mediated positive feedback loop of NF-κB
signaling, a mechanism known as the IL-6 amplifier,
during lung inflammation followed by ARDS with multi￾organ failure and coagulation (Fig. 1).
The IL-6 amplifier is a hyper NF-κB activation ma￾chinery in non-immune cells induced by the simultan￾eous activation of NF-κB and STAT3. It induces a
massive and sustained production of NF-κB target genes,
including IL-6, chemokines, and growth factors, which is
critical for the development of various disease models
including lung transplantation, rheumatoid arthritis, and
multiple sclerosis [56–60]. Furthermore, we have shown
that the co-activation of NF-κB and STAT3, which is
evidence of activation of the amplifier, is observed in
clinical specimens from patients with inflammatory dis￾eases [56, 61]. Additionally, the expression of target mol￾ecules of the inflammation amplifier is higher in the
serum of patients with rheumatoid arthritis or multiple
sclerosis [56, 61]. Moreover, the amplifier activation de￾pends on the concentrations of NF-κB stimulators and
of IL-6 around non-immune cells, but these concentra￾tions vary between cells. Indeed, activation tends to
occur more easily in tissue-specific non-immune cells
such as tracheal basement cells, synovial fibroblasts, ker￾atinocytes, kidney tubule cells, and chondrocytes. There￾fore, through the IL-6 amplifier, these cells could
regulate several tissue specific-inflammatory diseases
[56–60]. Furthermore, activation of the IL-6 amplifier
depends on various environmental and genetic factors.
Moreover, we have reported that stress and pain can be
triggered for the activation of the IL-6 amplifier at spe￾cific blood vessels [62, 63], and some SNPs have an ef￾fect on the activation, particularly via the NF-κB
pathway [56, 61]. These factors could explain the mild
to severe COVID-19 phenotypes observed.
Possible therapeutics for COVID-19
As mentioned above, excessive IL-6 levels are highly cor￾related with the lethal complications of COVID-19 pa￾tients [16, 64, 65]. Notably, a previous report showed
that inhibition of the NF-κB pathway in animals infected
with SARS-CoV decreases mortality and IL-6 levels [66].
As described above, the IL-6 amplifier plays a critical
role in chronic inflammatory diseases. The activation of
the IL-6 amplifier may induce a cytokine storm, a
phenotype of dysregulated inflammation. If this is the
case, the cytokine storm in severe COVID-19 could be
inhibited by blockade of the IL-6 amplifier [12]. Consist￾ently, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell-induced
fatal cytokine storm was prevented by an IL-6-STAT3
blocker [11, 12, 67].
Because the IL-6 amplifier is activated by the coactiva￾tion of NF-κB and STAT3 in non-immune cells, NF-κB
and STAT3 should be potential regulators of the COVID￾19-mediated cytokine storm shown in Fig. 1. There are
many NF-κB activators, such as PRRs, AT1R, ADAM17/
10, TNF-α-TNFR, and EGF-EGFR. Some could be thera￾peutic targets for the cytokine storm. However, IL-6 is the
major STAT3 activator during inflammatory responses.
Considering the availability of IL-6 inhibitors, IL-6-
STAT3 blockade could be a simple option to prevent
COVID-19-induced cytokine storm. TCZ is a recombin￾ant humanized monoclonal anti-IL-6R antibody and cur￾rently approved for use in patients with CAR-T cell￾induced severe cytokine storm or CRS with fever, hypoxia,
acute renal failure, hypotension, and cardiac arrhythmia
that often warrants ICU admission [11, 67]. The effective￾ness of TCZ has been also reported in CRS related to sev￾eral other conditions, such as sepsis, graft-versus-host
disease, and macrophage activation syndrome [68–70].
Common side effects of TCZ include increased upper re￾spiratory tract infections. Therefore, it might be difficult
to use TCZ for COVID-19 patients at the early phase of
the disease. Nevertheless, the inhibition of the signal
transduction mediated by IL-6, the critical STAT3 inducer
for the IL-6 amplifier, through binding to both mIL-6Rα
Hojyo et al. Inflammation and Regeneration (2020) 40:37 Page 4 of 7

and sIL-6Rα is a reasonable approach to consider for
treating cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients [12, 55]. In
fact, Luo and colleagues reported that TCZ administration
stabilizes clinical outcomes with a reduction of increased
C-reactive protein levels in more than half of COVID-19
patients at risk of a cytokine storm [71]. Moreover, Xu
et al. investigated whether TCZ treatment successfully im￾proves the respiratory function in a total of 21-
hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Indeed, among these 21
patients, 20 patients were recovered after the TCZ therapy
[72]. Toniati et al. also showed that 77% of patients out of
100 rapidly improved clinical and respiratory status after
TCZ treatment [73]. These series of study suggest that IL￾6-STAT3 signaling could be a promising target for the
clinical intervention of COVID-19.
Several ongoing clinical trials for TCZ in COVID-19
patients have been documented (phase II;
NCT04317092, NCT04445272, NCT04377659, phase III;
NCT04320615, NCT04330638, NCT04345445) (https://
clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=COVID-19). Another
anti-IL-6R antibody, SAR, used for rheumatoid arthritis
[74], has been tested in a multicenter, double-blind, clin￾ical phase II/III study in patients with severe COVID-19
(NCT04315298) [75]. Although Roche has not reached
significant effects of TCZ in phase III study
(NCT04320615), more careful study for patient selection
is important. We hypothesize that the timing of the
treatment should be important for suppressing the cyto￾kine storm induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Because
patients with severe COVID-19 symptoms have multior￾gan failure due to the high expression level of cytokines,
some of which regulate the function of the organs dir￾ectly or indirectly via blood endothelial cells that express
ACE2, we hypothesize that IL-6 inhibitors including
TCZ could mitigate cytokine storms in COVID-19 pa￾tients before multiorgan failure. As described in the re￾view, the study that found IL-6 inhibitors could suppress
cytokine storms in patients after CAR-T cell therapy
most likely did so by blocking the IL-6 amplifier [67]. In￾deed, on 18th September 2020, phase III study met its
primary endpoint, showing that patients with COVID-19
associated pneumonia who received TCZ were 44% less
likely to progress to mechanical ventilation or death
compared to patients who received placebo. Other thera￾peutic options that potentially inhibit JAK kinases re￾lated to IL-6 signaling, such as baricitinib (phase II/III;
NCT04340232) [76], are also potential therapeutic
candidates.
Conclusions
The cytokine storm and CRS in fatal COVID-19 are rep￾resented by several pathological features such as ARDS,
coagulation, and multiorgan dysfunctions. Since blood
IL-6 levels are highly correlated with the lethal
complications of COVID-19, we propose that IL-6 plays
a pivotal role in the disease augmentation and can be
thus a useful biomarker for determining the disease se￾verity. With this regard, TCZ is a good therapeutic op￾tion for disrupting the IL-6 amplifier, an IL-6-mediated
hyper-inflammatory mechanism that can be triggered by
innate immune signaling upon viral infection together
with Ang II-AT1R-mediated signaling due to the reduc￾tion of Ang II-quencher ACE2. However, in general,
monoclonal antibody-based therapeutics impose a sub￾stantial cost burden on patients and society. Therefore,
future research should be directed to the identification
of responsible molecules that regulate the IL-6 amplifier
in severe COVID-19, thereby enabling the development
of new clinical interventions using small molecules
against these targets. Intriguingly, SARS-CoV, MERS￾CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 show high genomic diversity and
are considered to have originated from bats. Given that
these viruses share viral spike proteins and utilize human
ACE2 receptor for their entry, it is highly possible that a
novel bat coronavirus may have been transmitted to
humans to cause emerging infectious diseases. There￾fore, clarification of the molecular mechanism for how
CRS promotes multiple symptoms in coronavirus￾related diseases is needed. Better understanding of this
issue will facilitate the development of novel therapies in
preparation for future COVID outbreaks.
