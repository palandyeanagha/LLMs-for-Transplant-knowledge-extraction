Abstract
Background: Benchmarking is the comparison of a process to the work or results of others. We
conducted a national benchmarking exercise to determine how UK pulmonologists manage
common clinical scenarios in diffuse parenchymal lung disease (DPLD), and to determine current
use and availability of investigative resources. We compared management decisions to existing
international guidelines.
Methods: Consultant members of the British Thoracic Society were mailed a questionnaire
seeking their views on the management of three common scenarios in DPLD. They were asked to
choose from various management options for each case. Information was also obtained from the
respondents on time served as a consultant, type of institution in which they worked and the
availability of a local radiologist and histopathologist with an interest/expertise in thoracic medicine.
Results: 370 out of 689 consultants replied (54% response rate). There were many differences in
the approach to the management of all three cases. Given a scenario of relapsing pulmonary
sarcoidosis in a lady with multiple co-morbidities, half of respondents would institute treatment
with a variety of immunosuppressants while a half would simply observe. 42% would refer a 57-
year old lady with new onset DPLD for a surgical lung biopsy, while a similar number would not.
80% would have referred her for transplantation, but a fifth would not. 50% of consultants from
district general hospitals would have opted for a surgical biopsy compared to 24% from
cardiothoracic centres: this may reflect greater availability of a radiologist with special interest in
thoracic imaging in cardiothoracic centres, obviating the need for tissue diagnosis. Faced with an
elderly male with high resolution CT thorax (HRCT) evidence of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP),
three quarters would observe, while a quarter would start immunosuppressants. 11% would refer
for a surgical biopsy. 14% of UK pulmonologists responding to the survey revealed they had no
access to a radiologist with an interest in thoracic radiology.
Conclusion: From our survey, it appears there is a lack of consensus in the management of DPLD.
This may reflect lack of evidence, lack of resources or a failure to implement current guidelines.

Background
Benchmarking is the comparison of a performance or
process to the work or results of others. It involves learn￾ing, sharing information and adopting best practices to
bring about improvements in performance. It was initially
an exercise carried out in industry, but it is now widely
used within healthcare. The process is so well established
that the UK Government supports a public sector bench￾marking service [1]. Benchmarking programmes in medi￾cal care have been set up to improve and maintain high
standards of care for patients and to regulate and maintain
training standards for healthcare professionals [2-4].
Diffuse parenchymal lung disease (DPLD) comprises over
200 conditions affecting the lung parenchyma. They are
said to account for 15% of respiratory practice [5], but
their clinical impact is probably underestimated [6-8].
The American Thoracic Society (ATS)/European Thoracic
Society (ERS) revision of the classification of DPLD [9]
standardised the classification of the idiopathic interstitial
pneumonias (IIP), distinguishing between idiopathic pul￾monary fibrosis (IPF) and IIPs other than IPF. Precise
diagnosis in DPLD is important for prognosis and treat￾ment. Establishing the diagnosis can be difficult and man￾agement options in many of these conditions are limited,
often involving the use of immunosuppressants. The Brit￾ish Thoracic Society (BTS) published its first guidelines on
DPLD in 1999 [10]. These addressed diagnosis and assess￾ment of DPLD, and focused treatment recommendations
on two major DPLDs, sarcoidosis and cryptogenic fibros￾ing alveolitis (CFA). The ATS published its guidelines on
sarcoidosis in 1999[11] in conjunction in the European
Respiratory Society (ERS) and the World Association of
Sarcoidosis and Granulomatous Disorders
(WASOG)[12], and for IPF in 2000 [13].
We carried out a benchmarking exercise to determine how
pulmonologists in the United Kingdom (UK) manage
common scenarios in DPLD. We wanted to see whether
there was a consensus on the management of these cases
and to review the use and availability of investigative
resources. We compared the management chosen for
three common scenarios to the recommendations in the
ATS and BTS guidelines. To our knowledge, this is the first
national benchmarking exercise for the management of
DPLD in the UK.
Methods
Six hundred and eighty nine consultant members of the
British Thoracic Society were mailed a questionnaire seek￾ing their views on three cases. Their opinion was sought
on various management options. The cases chosen were
common clinical scenarios in DPLD:
- relapsing sarcoidosis in a female with co-morbidities
(case 1, figure 1)
- new onset DPLD in a 57 year old female (case 2, figure 2)
- an elderly male with HRCT evidence of usual interstitial
pneumonia (UIP) (case 3, figure 3)
The clinical case scenarios were accompanied by an anon￾ymous questionnaire requesting information regarding:
- length of time served as a consultant (0–5years, 5–10
years, 11–20years or >20years)
- type of institution in which they worked (District Gen￾eral Hospital, Associated University Hospital, Teaching
Hospital or Cardiothoracic Centre)
- availability of local pathologist and radiologist with a
declared interest and expertise in thoracic pathology/radi￾ology
- whether or not they had sent out CT scans or histology
slides for a second opinion in the last two years
The cases are summarised in figures 1, 2, 3. Each case sce￾nario included one CT image, which had been reported by
a radiologist with expertise in DPLD. Respondents were
asked to choose from various management options sug￾gested on the questionnaire. We looked at whether insti￾tution type or length of time served as consultant
influenced management decisions.
The clinical case scenarios were fictional and the radio￾graphic images anonymised. Ethics Committee approval
was not required. No honorarium was provided for com￾pleting the questionnaire. The study was self funded.
Results
370 out of 689 physicians replied, giving a response rate
of 54%. Just over a third of respondents (36%) had been
a consultant for less than five years, with nearly a quarter
having served for more than twenty years (figure 4).
Fifty four percent of consultants were based at district gen￾eral hospitals (DGH) (secondary care centres), with 27%
working at teaching hospitals (secondary and tertiary care
centres) (figure 5). Eighty six percent of respondents said
they had a radiologist at their hospital with a declared
interest in thoracic radiology. Of the fourteen percent who
did not, three quarters of these worked in DGHs. Just
under fifty percent had sent out CT scans for a second
opinion in the last two years. Only 48% said they had a
pathologist at their institution with an expertise in tho-

racic pathology and in total, 53% had sent out histology
specimens for a second opinion.
When faced with a lady with relapsing sarcoidosis and
multiple co-morbidities (case 1), 47% of respondents
replied that they would defer starting treating and moni￾tor. Of those who would institute therapy, prednisolone
alone was the most popular choice (26%), with 10%
choosing prednisolone plus azathioprine (figure 6).
When analyzing the data looking at the management deci￾sions according to institution type or length of time served
as consultant, there were some differences. Fifty percent of
consultants from DGHs would defer starting treatment
compared to thirty percent of consultants based at teach￾ing hospitals. Similarly, one half of respondents who had
been a consultant for less than five years would defer start￾ing treatment compared to one third of those who had
been a consultant for more than twenty years. There was
no consensus on when to repeat lung function and chest
radiograph but the majority suggested as interval of
between 4–8 weeks.
Two thirds of all respondents said that they would not
repeat a HRCT for case 1. Over a third of these consultants
volunteered that the reason for not repeating the scan was
that the waiting time at their institutions for a HRCT was
very long.
For the final question in case 1, 13% of respondents said
they would not use any of the recommended tests to mon￾itor disease activity in sarcoidosis. Those who would use

A 48-year-old obese (BMI >40), 
hypertensive lady with known
sarcoidosis is seen in clinic with a 
minor deterioration in lung function 
and raised serum ACE.
Her chest radiograph shows new 
pulmonary infiltrates not seen on a 
plain film six months earlier. HRCT 
shows multiple nodules in the mid￾zones and fibrotic changes with 
associated bronchiectasis and extensive
lymphadenopathy.
She is not currently on any treatment
for sarcoidosis 
Management questions: 
Q1: Do you defer starting treatment and monitor closely, refer to a tertiary centre or 
start either: prednisolone alone, azathioprine with or without prednisolone, 
methotrexate with or without prednisolone or hydroxychloroquine?
Q2: How soon would you repeat lung function tests and chest x-ray? (choice 2-14 
weeks)
Q3: Would you repeat HRCT? If so, when?
Q4: Which of the following tests would you use to monitor disease activity? CRP, 
ESR, sACE or serial BAL

these tests, over fifty seven percent would use serum ACE,
22% CRP, 19% ESR and 2% would carry out serial bron￾choalveolar lavage (BAL).
When faced with a fairly young lady with HRCT evidence
of UIP (case 2), 42% of respondents would refer for open
lung biopsy (figure 7). A third would simply monitor
closely without any further invasive procedures. For the
second question in case 2, after the patient continued to
deteriorate, 79% of respondents would refer the lady for
lung transplantation, with 12% offering best supportive
care.
Looking at the impact of hospital type on management
revealed that 50% of respondents from DGHs would refer
for open lung biopsy compared to 24% of consultants
from cardiothoracic centres (tertiary care) (figure 8).
In the final case (figure 9), the elderly man with HRCT evi￾dence of UIP, 80% would monitor closely and not carry
out any further investigations. 11% would refer for open
lung biopsy, with 5% carrying out bronchoscopy with
transbronchial biopsies. 77% of respondents would mon￾itor the patient closely and would not commence immu￾nosuppressant therapy. 10% would start high dose
corticosteroids and 12% would start prednisolone plus
azathioprine. There were no significant differences by
institution type or time served as a consultant
Discussion
Our study has revealed some significant differences
amongst UK pulmonologists in their approach to manag￾ing three common scenarios in DPLD. In case 1, half of
respondents would institute treatment with a variety of
immunosuppressants while a half would simply observe.

Chest radiograph is abnormal and 
HRCT is performed. This shows

Management questions: 
Q1: What would your next step be: ask her to stop smoking and monitor closely, or 
proceed to bronchoscopy with or without BAL and/or transbronchial biopsy or refer 
for surgical lung biopsy? 
The patient refuses lung biopsy. She gives up smoking but continues to deteriorate 
despite trials of prednisolone, azathioprine and cyclophosphamide.
Q2: Do you offer best supportive care, referral for lung transplantation or another 
intervention?

The BTS guidelines recommend prednisolone in relapsing
pulmonary sarcoidosis and state that other anti-inflam￾matory agents should be reserved for patients who cannot
take steroids, with chloroquine and methotrexate being
the preferred agents. The ATS guidelines advocate the use
of corticosteroids for patients with persistent pulmonary
infiltrates and decline in spirometry, with antimalarials
and cytotoxic agents for those requiring long term steroid
therapy. Azathioprine was the preferred immunosuppres￾sant after prednisolone in our survey. This may reflect the
results of trials published since the guidelines [14,15].
Since the ATS/ERS/WASOG guidelines, many now regard
azathioprine and methotrexate to be the recommended
alternatives to prednisolone [16].
There was no consensus on when to repeat lung function
or chest radiograph (the guidelines do not give recom￾mended time intervals for these) for case 1. Interestingly,
nearly fifty per cent of all respondents said they would use
serum ACE to monitor disease activity. Serum ACE is ele￾vated in approximately 60% of patients with sarcoidosis
[17], but levels do not correlate with stage or prognosis.
The BTS guidelines do not recommend routine measure￾ment of serum ACE due to its poor sensitivity and specifi￾city. In the ATS guidelines, serum ACE can be used as a
marker of disease activity, but no opinion on its use is
given, only that it is never diagnostic on its own. The ATS
guidelines recommend following up patients with Stages
II – IV at least three to six months, with physical examina￾Case 3 – HRCT evidence of UIP in elderly male Figure 3

Management questions: 
Q1: What further investigations would you request: none, monitor closely, 
bronchoscopy and transbronchial biopsy or other?
Q2: How would you proceed with further management: continue regular monitoring, 
start high dose steroids, start steroids plus azathioprine or refer to a tertiary centre?

tion, chest radiograph and lung function tests. The British
guidelines to not give any advice as to when to follow up
these patients, but it also recommends the use of chest
radiographs and spirometry to monitor progress. Routine
use of CT scanning is not recommended for sarcoidosis,
but should be used in for patients with atypical clinical
history or chest radiographs and to detect complications
such as bronchiectasis and fibrosis.
Cases 2 and 3 dealt with two different patients with HRCT
features suggestive of UIP. Both British and American
guidelines state that in absence of an open lung biopsy,
the diagnosis of IPF remains uncertain. The ATS guide￾lines [13] give major and minor criteria which can be
applied in the absence of histology in order to make a
diagnosis of IPF. Several studies have shown that experi￾enced pulmonologists and radiologists can make a diag￾nosis of IPF on the basis on clinical and radiological data
alone [18,19]. It is interesting to see that 42% of our
respondents would have sent the lady in Case 2 for an
open lung biopsy, despite her having a HRCT picture typ￾Respondents place of work Figure 5

ical for UIP. Surgical biopsies should be reserved for when
the diagnosis is uncertain [20] or there is an atypical clin￾ical picture eg the patient is under 50 years old. Given the
poor outcome in IPF, the ATS guidelines recommend
treatment for all patients (unless there are contraindica￾tions) with corticosteroids, with or without immunosup￾pressive agents (azathioprine or cyclophosphamide).
Treatment response should be reviewed at six months.
The BTS guidelines suggest starting treatment if there has
been a drop in lung function or progression of symptoms,
with co-morbidities taken into account. It recommends
starting treatment with prednisolone and azathioprine.
Both set of guidelines recommend referral for transplanta￾tion for patients with progression of disease, and yet only
eighty per cent of pulmonologists surveyed would have
done so. In Case 3, only a quarter of respondents would
have commenced immunosuppressants. Is this because
they felt that in a 79 year old man the risks outweighed the
benefits?
Many pulmonologists spontaneously reported difficulty
in obtaining HRCT scans. HRCT scanning plays a key role
in the diagnosis of DPLD. Its primary role is to distinguish
between UIP and non-UIP. Certain forms of DPLD can be
diagnosed on the basis of HRCT findings and clinical his￾tory, without the need for tissue diagnosis. Indeed, a
recent North American survey showed that 67% of pul￾monologists rely on HRCT to diagnose UIP without
resorting to histological diagnosis [21]. In certain cases, it
may assist in determining prognosis eg in IPF [22]. It can
also help to determine the best site for surgical biopsy. Tis￾sue diagnosis has been regarded by many as the gold
standard diagnostic test in DPLD. Surgical biopsies may
yield false negative results due to interlobar and intralobar
variability [23]. The mortality rates related to open lung
biopsies is quoted in the guidelines as than 1%. This fig￾ure may be an underestimation – Utz et al [24] reported a
17% 30-day surgical mortality in patients with UIP under￾going a surgical biopsy.
We appreciate there are several limitations in our study.
The information provided in the case histories was lim￾ited, and the response rate was only 54%. However recent
changes in the working practices of UK Respiratory Physi￾cians has led to a significant degree of sub-specialisation
and it's likely that those who did not respond are those
who are majoring on the care of those with lung cancer or
sleep apnoea, and rarely see patients with DPLD. Never￾theless, we feel the exercise has highlighted important
issues. The study has revealed several "deviations" from
existing guidelines. Studies in other fields have often sug￾gested that physicians believe they adhere to guidelines
but often don't [25]. Others have suggested that evidence
based guidance is most likely to impact upon care if it's
clear, relevant to practice, properly funded, supported by
the profession and used in organizations that have estab￾lished good systems for tracking guidance [26].
Do differences reflect poor implementation of guidelines'
recommendations or lack of good evidence on which to
make recommendations leading to diversity of manage￾ment? Cabana M et al [27] have suggested that failure to
implement guidelines can reflect (a) poor dissemination
of guidelines (b) lack of belief in guidelines' recommen￾Replies for management options for Case 2 Figure 7

dations (c) doubt about one's ability to deliver the guide￾lines' recommendations (d) reverting to previous practice.
In this case it is possible that dissemination of the guide￾lines was less vigorous than for example asthma [28-30]
and also possibly reflect that there has been a paucity of
good trials in some of these areas, for example in the
Cochrane Reviews on the value of oral steroids in pulmo￾nary sarcoidosis [31] and IPF [32], only 12 trials could be
used for pulmonary sarcoidosis. For IPF, all 15 studies
which were identified had to be excluded due to inade￾quate methodologies. Lack of funding will also affect
one's ability to research the questions necessary to fill gaps
in evidence-based guidelines, and this is an especial prob￾lem in the field of DPLD [33].
Furthermore some may believe that the 1999 guidelines
are now out of date and that their reported practice is
more up to date [34]. However such an explanation can￾not explain why one fifth of pulmonologists caring for a
youngish person with terminal DPLD would not refer
such a person for consideration of a lung transplant. The
approach to the obtaining of confirmation of diagnosis by
means of surgical biopsy also varied considerably between
respondents. Many physicians have traditionally felt the
need for absolute confirmation of diagnosis in the
younger person in whom aggressive immunosuppression
and eventual transplantation may be appropriate. This
would explain the higher rate of referral for biopsy in Case
2 than Case 3. However it does not explain the paradox of
more physicians in District General Hospitals reporting
that they would refer a patient for a surgically obtained
lung biopsy than would their opposite numbers in cardi￾othoracic centres where access to surgery was presumably
easier. The paradox is most likely to reflect the greater like￾lihood of there being radiologists with a special expertise
in thoracic radiology in cardiothoracic centres, and mod￾ern imaging techniques, coupled with radiological exper￾tise which has permitted more accurate classification and
differentiation of patients with DPLD – making a patho￾logical diagnosis less necessary.

This non-availability of thoracic radiological expertise
(and to a greater extent non-availability of lung pathology
expertise) is a source of concern and suggests that patients
may be suffering as a result and certainly appear to be
more likely to have "unnecessary" surgical biopsies. This
could be rectified either by a greater degree of radiological
sub-specialisation or by the setting up of Regional Panels
of Radiological and Pathological expertise in DPLD to
whom images and biopsies could be referred [35,36]. The
disparity between histological diagnosis made by general
pathologists and specialist pathologists is highlighted in
the study by Lettieri et al [37]. In this paper, histological
diagnosis on interstitial lung disease biopsies made by
general pathologists was different to that of a specialist
pathologist in over 50% of cases, leading to changes in
clinical management in a significant number of cases.
Should DPLD be managed in designated centres in order
to ensure a more uniform approach? Such an approach
exists in other specialities. For example, in cystic fibrosis
(CF), it is felt that patients are best cared for in CF special￾ist centres, offering an experienced multidisciplinary
approach [38]. Often, there is shared care with the local
hospital. This allows the patient to be seen locally for con￾venience, whilst at the same time, being able to make use
of the facilities and resources of the specialist centre. In
any case, it is clear that resources need to be made more
available throughout the country.
Professional judgement by individual doctors is now
being challenged by the need to be shown to be producing
a cost effective service with uniform outcomes. We would
suggest that whilst benchmarking or similar such proc￾esses have previously been used mainly by healthcare
managers to look at hospitalisation rates and length of
hospital stay, it can provide an insight into other differ￾ences in process of care which may both stimulate new
research questions and also service production and imple￾mentation of guidelines.
Conclusion
From our benchmarking exercise, it appears that in the UK
there is a lack of consensus in the management of DPLD.
This may reflect lack of evidence, lack of resources or a
failure to implement existing guidelines.
