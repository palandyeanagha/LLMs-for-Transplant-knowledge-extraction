Abstract
Introduction: The ability to preserve organs prior to transplant is essential to the organ allocation process.
Objective: The purpose of this study is to describe the functional relationship between cold-ischemia time (CIT) and primary
nonfunction (PNF), patient and graft survival in liver transplant.
Methods: To identify relevant articles Medline, EMBASE and the Cochrane database, including the non-English literature
identified in these databases, was searched from 1966 to April 2008. Two independent reviewers screened and extracted
the data. CIT was analyzed both as a continuous variable and stratified by clinically relevant intervals. Nondichotomous
variables were weighted by sample size. Percent variables were weighted by the inverse of the binomial variance.
Results: Twenty-six studies met criteria. Functionally, PNF% = 26.678281+0.9134701*CIT Mean+0.1250879*(CIT
Mean29.89535)^220.0067663*(CIT Mean29.89535)^3, r2 = .625, , p,.0001. Mean patient survival: 93 % (1 month), 88 %
(3 months), 83 % (6 months) and 83 % (12 months). Mean graft survival: 85.9 % (1 month), 80.5 % (3 months), 78.1 % (6
months) and 76.8 % (12 months). Maximum patient and graft survival occurred with CITs between 7.5–12.5 hrs at each
survival interval. PNF was also significantly correlated with ICU time, % first time grafts and % immunologic mismatches.
Conclusion: The results of this work imply that CIT may be the most important pre-transplant information needed in the
decision to accept an organ.

Introduction
Procuring and transplanting organs are the two main functions of
the liver allocation system. Preserving livers until they can be
transplanted is an essential intermediate step. The U.S. Organ
Procurement and Transplantation Network and the Scientific
Registry of Transplant Recipients, has recently has begun to publish
the effect of cold-ischemia time (the time from clamping of the
donor aorta until the anastomosis of the organ to the recipients
vascular system or the organs disposal) on clinical outcomes- patient
and graft survival [1]. Many other factors also contribute to the
success or failure of an organ to function [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]
once transplanted and on patient and graft survival. However, cold￾ischemia time also determines in part how far we can transport
organs [13]. This in turn influences the size of the pool of organs
available to patients [14]. The larger the pool the more chances for
an optimal donor/recipient match. Therefore, understanding the
effectiveness of organ preservation technology is important in
understanding how best to allocate organs.
The primary purpose of this project is to help quantify and
describe the functional relationship between cold-ischemia time
and primary nonfunction (death or retransplant due to liver failure
within 14 days of initial transplant unrelated to acute rejection)
and patient and graft survival. In addition, we also examined the
effect of other factors hypothesized to influence initial graft
function and patient and graft survival. This information will help
understanding the functional limitations of the liver allocation
system and how best to optimize its performance.

Methods
Literature search
We performed a search of MEDLINE, EMBASE and the
Cochrane database, including the non-English literature identified
in these databases, to identify all potentially relevant articles that
were published between 1966 and January 2008 that reported the
duration of preservation of cadaveric livers and their function after
transplant. The search was further augmented by scanning the
references of the identified articles and reviews (JES). See Figure 1.
Assessment of validity
Two separate investigators (JK, FA) independently evaluated
studies for inclusion. The observed agreement between the
investigators for the assessment for inclusion was calculated using
the kappa statistic. After the initial article selection, the article
dataset was reviewed and updated to capture any articles
published between the final consensus review and the final data
analysis (JES). Articles were potentially acceptable if they were
randomized-controlled trials, case-control trials with appropriate
matching or prospective observational studies. Trials were scored
using a quality rating system adapted from Chalmers [15,16],
Cochrane Collaboration [17] and others.
Our scoring system attempted to remove studies with significant
selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias or detection bias.
Our scoring system included the following questions, 1) Was the
trial design clearly stated?, 2) Selection bias questions: Was the
Patient selection process clearly stated?, If the trial was an RCT,
were patient randomly allocated to the therapeutic intervention?
Were patients and clinicians blinded to the intervention? If the
trial was not an RCT, were confounders controlled for? If the trial
design was case control were matching procedures clearly
described and implemented? Were patient recruitment procedures
clearly described? Were the intervention and control groups
selected for similarly? 3) Performance bias questions: Was the
intervention clearly described? , Was intervention clearly mea￾sured? 4) Attrition bias questions: Were patients followed up?,
Were they followed up for 2 or more explicitly defined intervals? If
patients were lost/ dropped out other than due to death were they
accounted for? Were all outcome measures captured at the
declared follow up intervals? 5) Detection bias questions: Were the
outcome measures clearly described? Was measurement of the
outcome measures blinded? 6) Were appropriate statistical
methods used?, were p values clearly states, was life table analysis
provided, etc. 7) Was the presentation of data adequate, for
example, in the article were endpoints clearly defined i.e., PNF,
graft survival, patient survival, duration of follow up, retransplan￾tation rate, etc? Were survival curves provided or were sufficient
data to construct survival curves provided, were donor and
recipient variables clearly defined and presented [15,16].
These questions were placed on a 3 point scale: Unclear/
inadequate (0), adequate (1), good (2). Articles were considered for
inclusion if their summary score exceeded 30. The kappa statistic
for the independent reviewers was .93.
Study Characteristics
The primary independent variable of interest was the cold
ischemia time of the procured cadaveric liver. Studies were
stratified by duration of preservation (hours), the preservation
method used (Euro-Collins solution, University of Wisconsin
solution, Celsior solution, etc.), and the primary outcome of initial
graft function (primary nonfunction) and patient and graft
survival. Primary nonfunction is defined broadly as death or
retransplant due to liver failure within 14 days of initial transplant
unrelated to acute immunologically-mediated rejection [18,19,20].
Data extraction
Two independent reviewers extracted data from the selected
articles, reconciling any differences by consensus or when in doubt
referring it for arbitration by a third reviewer (JES). The mean
CIT for each preservation solution subgroup in each of the studies
was extracted or calculated from the data provided. CIT was
defined as cold perfusion until the time of circulatory reperfusion
or disposal.
Other variables hypothesized as having a relationship to initial
graft function and patient and graft survival were also extracted.
For donors these included: age, gender, race, HLA-matching,
biopsy histology, warm ischemia time, organ procurement time,
Monoethylglycinexylide (MEGX, a metabolic function test) test
results, ICU days, and bilirubin, creatinine, AST and ALT (liver
transaminases) levels at the time of procurement. For recipients
these included: age, gender, race, weight, pre-transplantation
waiting time, previous abdominal surgery, ABO blood group or
match/no match with donor, pre-transplant Karnofsky score,
infection status, nutritional status, etiology of end-stage liver
disease, UNOS and Child-Pugh score and number of previous

donor/recipient mismatches. We also extracted peri-operative
variables such as the use of a reduced or ‘‘split’’ liver, surgery
duration, blood loss, bile flow in the first three days, peak post
transplant bilirubin, prothrombin time, ammonia, creatinine, AST
and ALT (liver transaminases) levels. Finally, we also extracted the
re-transplantation rate within 3 months. Data was tested for
heterogeneity using Chi2, and graphically using normal-quantile
plot as a test of the normality of the distributions and funnel plots
of the variable vs. year of study.
Data synthesis and analysis
To evaluate the effect of CIT on immediate post-transplant
function and patient and graft survival, we first determined the
mean duration of CIT for each preservation solution group in the
study. We then determined the rate of primary nonfunction (PNF)
for each of these groups to estimate the effect of preservation
duration on the immediate post-transplant success. We also
determined the 1 month, 3 month, 6 month, 1 year, 2 year, 5
year and 10 year patient and graft survival for these groups. For
each time point a weighted mean estimate of survival was
generated.
Because we hypothesized that the rate of PNF would vary
continuously with the duration of CIT [1,13], we could not expect
the sample to be homogenous within any particular subset. We
therefore analyzed the mean CIT data both as a continuous
function, as well as, stratified by ordinal time intervals hypothe￾sized to be clinically relevant.
Each study reported an intervention and control group.
Typically two preservation solutions were compared. Each article
reported one or more subgroups with differing mean CITs. We
assumed that the recipients of a transplant were essentially the
same in with regard to clinical urgency across preservation
solutions within articles. In addition, after preliminary inspection
of the data it became apparent that very few studies meeting
inclusion criteria had subgroups with preservation fluids other
than University of Wisconsin (UW) (80%), Euro-Collins (EC)
(14.5%) or Celsior (5.5%) as their primary preservation solution,
typically a test and control solution. In addition, groups using
Celsior or Euro-Collins solutions tended to have shorter CITs.
The potential difference in efficacy between solutions independent
of CIT was controlled for via regression analysis much in the same
way one would control for gender when predicting the relationship
between age and weight. To test for any consequences of mixing
different designs we conducted further subgroup and sensitivity
analyses based on study design.
These study subgroups were further stratified into intervals of
CIT. The 5 subgroups based on mean CIT were: ,5 hrs, 5–7.5
hrs, 7.5–10 hrs, 10–12.5 hrs, and .12.5 hrs. These intervals are
narrower than the 5 hours increments reported in the OPTN/
SRTR Annual report [1]. The time intervals chosen were a
compromise between inter-quintile ranges of the reported mean
CITs and clinical relevance. The reported data beyond 12.5 hours
the data becomes progressively more sparse, variable and difficult
to provide meaningful analysis on. For each CIT interval, we
tested whether or not the effect (PNF, patient and graft survival)
was homogenous within the interval using fixed and random
effects models [21]. Chi-square tests were used to test the inter￾study variability. A p-value less than .1 was considered significant.
However, because we hypothesized that PNF and survival would
vary with mean CIT, we also analyzed the data using mean CIT
as a continuous function. In addition, where possible we stratified
donor and recipient variables to test for any significant differences
in the subgroups.
The outcomes, PNF and patient and graft survival were
estimated as a weighted percents. All three were treated as having
binomial distributions since the outcomes were binomial, e.g.,
survive/ no survive at any given point in time. Therefore, the
effect of a given study at a given point in time, e.g., 3 months, was
p (percent). Its weight was the inverse of its variance (1/npq) where
n is the number in the subgroup and q is 1- p. These outcomes
were also at the post transplant intervals of 1 month, 3 months, 6
months and 1 year.
Each subgroup contributed distinct data on its mean CIT,
survival and other parameters of interest, which was weighted as
described above. The functional relationships between CIT and
initial organ function and patient and graft survival were explored

through regression analysis of the subgroup data. Summary point
estimates of, for example, mean length of stay, were derived by
pooling the weighted parameter estimates for each subgroup.
Other factors hypothesized as influencing these relationships, for
example, age, were tested for significance using standard least
square models on the subgroup data.

Trial characteristics
There were 26 studies included in the final analysis: 4 randomized
controlled trials, 6 prospective cohort studies and 16 case-control
studies. The earliest was published in 1989. Table 1 shows the
characteristics of the studies included in the meta-analysis. The
quality of all included trials quality was either adequate

or good [40,41,42]. The studies included (Table 2) patients of which
64.3% of the donors and 54.1% of recipients were male. The mean
age for donors was 29.9 years (s.d. = 1.3) and mean age of the
recipients was 40.6 years (s.d. = 8.6). The mean study subgroups
sample size was 99 (s.d. = 116) and median patient follow up was 12

months (range 1–72 months) median graft follow up was 12 months
(range 1–60 months). No study reported the full set of all donor
variable and recipient variables identified as being of possible
importance. Table 3 shows the variables collected where more than
one study reported results. Not all studies provided parameter
variance estimates. Therefore, nondichotomous variables were
weighted by sample size. Outcome variables reported as percents
were weighted by the inverse of the binomial variance, i.e., 1/npq.
Using chi statistic to test for heterogeneity of PNF within the
CIT intervals, we find there is low heterogeneity for intervals
under 7.5 hours and increasing heterogeneity and fewer studies as
we move to the tail of the PNF vs CIT distribution: For the CIT
interval 0–2.5 hrs the p value for Chi2 was .95 and I2 was 24.9, for
the CIT interval 2.5–5 hrs the p value for Chi2 was .95 and I2 was
36.6, for the CIT interval 5–7.5 hrs the p value for Chi2 was .95
and I2 was 36.6, for the CIT interval 7.5–10 hrs the p value for
Chi2 was .94 and I2 was 81, for the CIT interval 10 . hrs the p
value for Chi2 was .94 and I2 was 95.6.
There were no significant difference across the predetermined
CIT intervals with regard to donor gender (p = .9), warm ischemia
time (time from last artery clamped to immersion in preservation
solution) (p = .47), MEGX score (p = .9 ), recipient age (p = .66),
recipient gender (p = .68), or recipient AST peak within index
admission (p = .54), length of stay (p = .18) in the hospital or ICU
(p = .15). In addition, there were no significant differences across
these intervals with regard to UNOS score. However if you
grouped by UNOS 1 and 2 there was a significant trend (p = .01,
r2 = .9 ) toward increase urgency the higher the CIT. IN addition
there was significant trend for increasing recipient bilirubin peak
(p = .06, highest for CIT between 5–10 hrs) and recipient PT peak
(p = .01, 2 = .7) the longer CIT. However, as predicted (the
relationships between CIT and PNF and patient and graft survival
were hypothesized as being continuous), PNF and patient and
graft survival varied systematically with CIT. There was significant
difference across these intervals with regard to PNF and patient
and graft survival (see figure 2–6).
As mention above, the subgroups using EC or Celsior solutions
did have significantly shorter mean CIT (6 hrs) than the UW
subgroups (10 hrs). However, the adjusted PNF for the EC or
Celsior groups were not significantly different from the UW group
nor were they significantly different on any of the contextual
variables listed in Tables 1–3 when controlled for by CIT. The one
exception was for those groups with a CIT.12.5 hrs. For this
group the rate of blood type mismatch (p = .05) and recipient
mean AST during index admission (p = .03) were significantly
worse than for other CIT intervals. There were insufficient studies
to demonstrate whether or not the PNF rate for those using UW
(3%) with a CIT shorter than 6 hours was not significantly
different than the EC and Celsior (4%) groups (p = .37).
Mean CIT did not significantly vary by year of publication.
However, both average donor age (1.67 yrs per year, p,.0001) and
recipient age did increase significantly (.0 years per year, p = .004)
over the period of time (1989–2007) covered by the studies. There
was a trend towards reduced PNF over this period but this did not
reach the level of significance (0 = .46) Subgroup analysis and
sensitivity analyses did not reveal any significant difference in the
results of the analyses across study designs (p = .17), however, the
trend appeared to be for RCTs to have lower PNFs.
Across all groups, PNF was not significantly correlated with
recipient ICU time (p = .8), inversely related with the percentage
of first time grafts transplanted (p = .3) and positively correlated
related with the percent of ABO mismatches (p = .56).

Regression analysis and Quantitative data synthesis
PNF. For the whole group the mean PNF was 7.8%
(s.d. = 9.3%) and the median PNF was 2% (range 0–21.2 %).
PNF varied systematically with CIT. A third degree function
relating mean CIT with weighted PNF had an r2 = .55,
p = ,.0001, which is significantly better than linear, second
degree or natural log forms. This function was:
Weighted PNF% = 20.045838+0.0070228 mean CIT+0.0015596
(mean CIT29.63524)^220.0000771 (mean CIT29.63524)^3,
r2 = .625, p,.0001. See Figure 2. Univariate analysis indicated that
other than mean CIT, PNF was directly proportional to recipient
LOS (p = .13).
Patient Survival
Mean patient survival for the whole group was 93 % at 1
month, 88 % at 3 months, 83 % at 6 months and 83 % at 12
months. An exponential patient survival function was assumed.
This was % Survival = 93.1824.4 Log(time) for the whole group.
See Figure 3. If one regressed patient survival against CIT at 1
month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months post-transplant, a
quadratic relationship with CIT is revealed, with survival reaching
a maximum with CITs between 7.5 and 10 hours. Patient survival
worsens above and below this interval. See Figure 4.
Graft Survival
Mean graft survival for the whole group was 85.9 % at 1 month,
80.5 % at 3 months, 78.1 % at 6 months and 76.8 % at 12 months.
An exponential survival function was assumed. This was %
Survival = 85.2923.59 Log(time) for the whole group. See
Figure 5. If one regressed graft survival against CIT at 1 month,
3 months, 6 months, and 12 months post-transplant, a quadratic
relationship with CIT is also revealed. As with patient survival,
maximum survival at each of these post transplant time points
reached a maximum when the graft’s CIT was between 7.5 and
12.5 hours. Graft survival worsens above and below this interval.
See Figure 6.
Discussion
Cold-ischemia time appears to be a good predictor of not only
PNF but also of patient and graft survival [1,13]. The damage to
livers incurred during prolonged CIT has been hypothesized as
being the cause of PNF. This in turn has been hypothesized to
result from injury to the hepatic sinusoidal epithelial cells, which in
turn results in a cascade of injuries involving the microcirculation
and the release of various cytotoxic products [43,44,45]. The
resulting damage to the hepatocytes presumably results in varying
levels of organ dysfunction up to and including primary hepatic

nonfunction at transplant. This may be exacerbated by other
factors such as warm-ischemia time [13].
Cold-ischemia time along with the supply of organs, patient
demand and the matching regime appear to be the key parameters
to the liver allocation system. Therefore, reducing CIT through
more efficient organ allocation [13,14] or improving the
preservation method should improve outcomes and the effective
use of a limited healthcare resource. Understanding the relation￾ship between CIT, PNF and patient and graft survival can help
better define the limits and needs of our allocation system and
better match more organs to patients.
A key factor determining the consequences of CIT is the
preservation method. Preservation methods have evolved and
improved considerably over time and may be expected to continue
to do so. The better preservation becomes the closer the system
resembles banking systems like the one used for blood products.
Such a system would allow better buffering of imbalances between
supply and demand. Historically, the first preservation solutions
were isotonic electrolytic solutions for skin grafts such as Ringer’s
solutions in the 1890s [46]. Refrigeration came into use in the
1940–50s to preserve skin used as temporary dressing for burns
(www.transweb.org/reference/timeline). Since the first successful
solid organ transplants (Kidney 1953 Boston, JE Murray, Brigham
and Women’s Hospital, Boston, MA) and the first successful liver
transplant (Liver 1963, Denver, T Starzl, Univ. Col.) [21], there
has been a growing need to be able to preserve organs for longer
periods of time. The most commonly used preservation media
have been Euro Collins [47], University of Wisconsin Solution
[48] and Celsior solution [49]. At first cut, in our study groups
using Celsior solution appeared to perform better with regard to
PNF than the other groups. However, the Celsior patients also had
shorter CITs than either the UW or EC groups. Although there
appeared to be the beginnings of a trend indicating improved
outcomes with Celsior, we had insufficient studies using Celsior
solution, due to the strict constraints of our inclusion and exclusion
criteria, to determine if this solution performed better when

controlling for CIT. The results presented in this study represent
an aggregation of the performance of preservation solutions to
date. This study cannot capture the behavior preservation
technologies currently in trial.
In addition to CIT and preservation solution, many other donor
and recipient factors have been hypothesized as contributing to
poor outcomes [4,5,8,9,38,50,51,52,53,54,55]. Being able to use a
simple blood test or patient historical factor to predict outcome
prior to transplant has obvious advantages for making organ
allocation decisions. The only factors, other than CIT, we found to
consistently and significantly associated with poor outcome were:
the recipient ICU length of stay after transplant, blood type
incompatibility between graft and host, and the percentage of first
time transplant recipients in the group. We might hypothesize that
these factors are more strongly associated with sicker (e.g., longer
ICU stays) and/or more desperate patients (e.g., willing to accept a
blood type mismatch). While no individual lab test rose to the level
of significance in predicting PNF, it remains possible that
combinations of these lab tests might be predictive where
individually they are not. With regard to the final item, we might
hypothesize that first time transplant recipients may be more
clinically urgent or more likely to have an undiagnosed immuno￾incompatability than repeat transplant patients.
The relationship between CIT and PNF also appears not to be
strictly linear. PNF and organ and patient survival were worse for
both high and low CITs. Similar findings are reported in the
OPTN annual report [1]. One hypothesis is that this may be a
result of disadvantageous combinations of patients and organs. It
may be that patients who receive organs less than 5 hours from
harvest and those that receive them after 12.5 hours from harvest
are more likely to be sicker than average, more clinically urgent or
more difficult to find an adequate match. It may be that the
freshest organs are rushed to the very sickest patients or that the
most desperate patients or the most difficult to match patients with
limited options were offered older organs as being the only ones
available. It seems that there is a nonlinear interaction between
patient and organ offer that determines survival and that this effect
is worse when both patient and organ are near the end of their
lives. A patient in poor health with a fresh organ results in a
slightly worse result than a good organ in a stable patient. Older
organs and patients in poor health result in the worst outcomes.
Though the data did not reach significance, it is a partial
validation of this hypothesis that the greatest percentage of UNOS
1 patients were found in groups with a mean CIT less than 5 hours
and .12.5 hours. This may be why those on the low end of CIT
seemed to experience only slightly increased PNF and those on the
high end experience very significant PNF. Another hypothesis is
that this behavior at the extremes of CIT may be related to the
characteristics of the regions in which the organs were procured
and transplanted. For example, it may be that the quality of the
procured organ and the clinical urgency of the persons receiving
the transplant may be related to the size of the region in which the

transplant took place [56]. Unfortunately, the available data did
not provide sufficient information on the site of transplant to
reliably test this hypothesis.
Whereas it would be ideal to run a randomized clinical trial to
evaluate the question of the effect of cold ischemia time on clinical
outcome, this would be impossible because of concerns of ethics
and logistic feasibility. It is also very difficult to conduct
randomized controlled trial in a surgical setting do to difficulty
in blinding participants, hence the need for a meta-analysis to
examine this question. However, it should be noted that any meta￾analytic exercise runs the risk of publication bias. We checked for
this by testing whether or not the extracted data was skewed in one
direction or another within the analyzed time strata. Fortunately,
no obvious bias was revealed. However, this does not necessarily
preclude missing data rather just that the data we do have is self￾consistent. We tried to carefully control the quality of the studies
we included by setting stringent criteria to exclude problems with
selection bias, performance bias, attrition bias, and detection bias
as per the consort criteria.
Our analysis seems to indicate that investing in more research
into preservation methods would have a clear benefit on organ
supply and survival. It may be also possible to create relatively

decision making in the organ allocation system [14].
