Abstract
Bronchiolocentric fibrosis is essentially represented by the
pathological pattern of constrictive fibrotic bronchiolitis obliterans.
The corresponding clinical condition (obliterative bronchiolitis) is


characterised by dyspnoea, airflow obstruction at lung function
testing and air trapping with characteristic mosaic features on
expiratory high resolution CT scans. Bronchiolitis obliterans may
result from many causes including acute diffuse bronchiolar damage
after inhalation of toxic gases or fumes, alloimmune chronic
processes after lung or haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, or
connective tissue disease (especially rheumatoid arthritis). Airway-
centred interstitial fibrosis and bronchiolar metaplasia are other
features of bronchiolocentric fibrosis.
