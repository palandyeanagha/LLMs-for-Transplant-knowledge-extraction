Summary
Meticulous attention to detail during the early postoperat￾ive period after lung transplantation is crucial for the over￾all success of the procedure. It starts in the intensive care
unit with the initiation of immunosuppression, implement￾ation of anti-infective strategies and stabilisation of respir￾atory function. The subsequent days and weeks on the reg￾ular ward focus on titration of immunosuppressive drugs,
vigilant fluid management, early mobilisation and initi￾ation of physiotherapy. In parallel, the lung transplant re￾cipients are actively taught about self-monitoring and self￾management strategies to allow for a smooth transition to
outpatient follow-up care. This article intends to commu￾nicate the practical aspects and principles of the patient
management used at the authors’ centre on a daily basis
by a multi-disciplinary transplant team, having at its core
both a transplant pulmonologist and a thoracic surgeon. It
focuses on the first month after lung transplantation, but

Introduction
Lung transplantation is an established therapeutic option
for nonmalignant end-stage lung disease. Survival of lung
transplant recipients (LTRs) is inferior to recipients of most
other solid organ transplants owing to the great number of
complications in the first postoperative year. Some com￾plications may be preventable or easy to correct if treated
appropriately; however, in many situations management
strategies are less clear because firm evidence from sys￾tematic evaluation or randomised controlled trials is not
available. Many therapeutic strategies are based on expert
opinion only or modified from experience with other solid
organ transplant recipients, and some have stood the test
of time after being adapted for LTRs. In the few available
articles and book chapters covering the early postoperative
management, the amount and level of detail of practical
guidance varies considerably [1–3]. Many publications fo￾cus on an analytical approach, investigating, for example,
aetiology, pathophysiology and therapeutic measures in the
early postoperative phase. However, these articles gener￾ally do not mention the practical aspects of implementation
with direct relevance to the attending physician. As a mat￾ter of fact, there are no guidelines for the management of
the early postoperative period after lung transplantation [1,
4–7]. This article presents a practical approach on how to
manage LTRs in the immediate postoperative phase, based
on the authors’ centre experience, providing evidence to
support this practice wherever available [8]. It is our aim to
share our experience with colleagues new to the field and
stimulate discussion and open up potential research areas

of interest on how to best treat our patients. Rare com￾plications and mostly surgical issues including indications
for surgical reintervention are not dealt with here [9]. We
are aware that there are various successful ways to manage
these patients in the early postoperative period, and this is
only one possible strategy that is influenced by available
resources and local expertise generated over twenty years.
The first postoperative days
After successful transplantation, recipients are routinely
transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) immediately
from the operating theatre. Generally, patients are still in￾tubated and some might even require postoperative ex￾tracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support.
Weaning from both ventilator and ECMO is primarily in
the hands of the intensive care physicians, but usually in
consultation with the thoracic surgeon and transplant phys￾ician, as are basically all other aspects of care [10, 11].
Independently of the level of experience of the intensivists
in charge, twice daily ICU ward rounds by the transplant
team are of vital importance in order to assist with monit￾oring the patient’s clinical status and to obtain a cross-func￾tional update on the patient’s progress, including vital para￾meters, early immunosuppression, monitoring of wounds/
drains, nursing information and physical therapy. Ideally, at
least one daily ward round should be attended by a senior
thoracic surgeon, a transplant physician and the ICU con￾sultant in charge, as a team. In some settings the infectious
disease specialist is part of daily transplant team rounds
since infections are among the most frequent complications
in this period. We have a dedicated transplant infectious
diseases specialist who is consulted on a demand basis.
Initial immunosuppression and
antimicrobial therapy
A key issue of the successful management of LTRs is the
establishment of adequate immunosuppression in order to
prevent acute allograft rejection, while at the same time
avoiding over-immunosuppression with deleterious conse￾quences. In general, a standard triple immunosuppressive
regimen is used, with initial dosing having been discussed
at the time of listing the patient for lung transplantation
[12]. Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs), especially cyclosporine
A (CsA) and tacrolimus (Tac), are cornerstones of the im￾munosuppressive strategy. There are good arguments for
both agents with a majority of lung transplant centres now
using Tac as first line CNI [13]. They have a different
effect on cardiovascular risk factors, with Tac having a bet￾ter profile for arterial tension and lipid metabolism, and
CsA for glucose metabolism. At present, data on whether
these differences in risk profile alter patient or graft sur￾vival or long-term cardiovascular morbidity/mortality are
scarce [14]. In a recent multicentre randomised study com￾paring CsA with Tac, the incidence of chronic rejection
at 3-year follow-up was reduced in the Tac-containing re￾gimen without significant effects on mortality [15]. Tac￾treated patients may more often experience alopecia,
whereas CsA is associated with hirsutism and gingival hy￾perplasia [16].
CsA is our drug of choice because of our many years of
experience with the intricacies of this compound, and we
reserve Tac for rare situations as a second-line CNI. In ad￾dition, perioperative antibiotic therapy is based on the in￾dividual patient’s previously isolated airway pathogens and
the established antibiogram. The antibiotic regimen is ad￾apted by the transplant physician while the patient is on the
waiting list if new pathogens are isolated or sensitivity pat￾terns change. The revised antibiotic therapy regimen is up￾dated in the clinical information system, and is thus avail￾able to the transplant surgeons at time of transplantation.
Special issues are discussed in the weekly interdisciplinary
meeting, such as the need for intraoperative sampling of
lung tissue or lymphnodes for special examination (micro￾biology, mycobacterial diagnostics, pathology) or specif￾ic anti-infective preventive strategies (taurolidin use intra￾operatively, etc.). Immunosuppressive medication is started
immediately before surgery with the first dose of oral CsA
approximately 2 hours before anaesthesia (2 mg/kg). Ster￾oids and mycophenolate (MMF) are initiated postoperat￾ively according to our centre’s protocol as previously pub￾lished, for example MMF 1.5 g for a 70 kg adult patient
[17]. Both are continued postoperatively at 12-hour inter￾vals. At our institution, induction therapy is employed (ba￾siliximab 20 mg on both day 0 and day 4). Immunosup￾pression includes methylprednisone 500 mg IV given at the
time of reperfusion for each lung (two doses for bilater￾al transplantation, total 1 g) followed by 125 mg methyl￾prednisone intravenously on days 1 and 2 after surgery.
While intubated, LTRs receive CsA and MMF via a naso￾gastric tube whereby all preventive measures for gastro￾oesophageal reflux are maintained. In general, from day 3
onwards, prednisone 0.5 mg/kg is given orally or via post￾pyloric tube. If LTRs are not extubated by day 2 or 3, a duo￾denal tube is inserted by the gastroenterologist. From day
2 onwards, the CsA dose is adjusted on the basis of thera￾peutic drug monitoring (TDM), with initial target levels of
250–300 mcg/L for C0 (CsA trough level) and 1100–1200
mcg/L for C2 (CsA peak level). In the case of renal dys￾function, lower target levels are used: 180–200 mcg/L for
C0 and 750–800 mcg/L for C2. If adequate levels are not
reached within 3–4 days we change to intravenous (IV)
administration of CsA, especially in the case of transient
increased variability of intestinal drug absorption (due to
altered intestinal transit times i.e. diarrhoea or obstipation).
The same is true for suspected insufficient absorption of
MMF (either by means of TDM or because of lack of
lymphopaenia) and steroids, which then are given intraven￾ously until the clinical condition allows for stepwise rein￾troduction of the triple immunosuppression by the oral or
enteral route [18]. Owing to the low bioavailability of CsA,
the IV dose is nominally only approximately one-third of
the oral dose. If immunosuppressants are given enterally,
we use the syrup solution diluted in 2–3 ml noncarbonated
mineral water for CsA and MMF, prednisone tablets are
ground and suspended in mineral water before ingestion.
For obstructed enteral tubes we use one ampoule of ascor￾bic acid or 3 ml Cola soft drink to free the system.

Infection prevention strategies
LTRs are prone to infection because of the specific circum￾stances of the allograft and the profound immunosuppres￾sion [19]. Bacterial pneumonia is frequent, especially in
the first month [19, 20]. Therefore, antimicrobial therapy
is administered to all LTRs, starting intraoperatively with a
broad-spectrum antibiotic such as piperacillin-tazobactam
or meropenem. We do not routinely cover for Gram-pos￾itive organisms unless sampling suggests such pathogens.
In cases with known Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PSA) in￾fection, a dual antibiotic strategy is chosen on the basis
of previous antibiograms, generally including one of the
above drugs in combination with either ciprofloxacin, an
aminoglycoside (amikacin or tobramycin) or colistin IV. If
multiresistant PSA is present, we may use a triple antibi￾otic strategy, in which inhaled colistin or tobramycin, or
taurolidine are used in addition. We use taurolidine exclus￾ively in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients after lung transplant￾ation with multiresistant or panresistant bacteria (PSA or
Burkholderia cepacia complex). A 1% solution is replaced
with a 2% solution if well tolerated, and nasal and oral in￾halation routes are alternated. This use is off label and not
supported by large clinical trials, yet in our experience it
has proven valuable [21]. Drug sensitivity testing is a cru￾cial component of the antimicrobial strategy to better tar￾get the above mentioned organisms [22]. As part of our
anti-infective regimen, LTRs with CF generally undergo si￾nus surgery (bilateral frontosphenoethmoidectomy) within
a few weeks after lung transplantation, aiming to reduce
the potential for pulmonary contamination as recently de￾scribed [23].
Pneumocystis jiruveci pneumonia (PJP) prophylaxis is star￾ted immediately after transplantation, with trimethoprim￾cotrimoxazol one full strength tablet 3 times per week. An￾tifungal therapy in the perioperative phase is also based
upon on the pretransplant assessment of the recipient. If
Aspergillus species or a combination of multiple fungal
organisms has been documented, we opt for early use of
caspofungin also to prevent anastomotic problems [9, 17].
In documented pretransplant aspergillus infection of the re￾cipient or presence of Aspergillus in the donor samples, we
start caspofungin immediately awaiting further microbiolo￾gical results (IV 50 mg daily without loading dose).
Regular antifungal therapy with itraconazole (200 mg BID)
and inhalation of amphotericin B (10 mg BID) is usually
started on day 5–7 postoperatively. In situations of transient
apparent overlap of the antifungal spectrum (intraconazole
plus caspofungin) we do not interrupt intraconazole transi￾ently for reasons of interaction stability, thus maintaining a
stable immunosuppression [18, 24, 25]. We recommend an
inhalation device producing a medium particle size in or￾der to reach the large and medium-size bronchi (e.g. Pari
Boy SX with blue LC Sprint Aerolizer). If Amphotericin
B inhalations trigger bronchial obstruction, a bronchodilat￾or (salbutamol) is used before inhaling the antifungal solu￾tion.
Additional antibiotics or changes of the antimicrobial ther￾apy are targeted on the organisms detected in the explanted
lungs and the samples taken from the donor bronchus at
transplantation [19]. We have a low threshold for seeking
clostridial infection in stool samples since Clostridium dif￾ficile colitis is common in the first 3 months [26]. If
clostridial infection is suspected, we empirically start with
oral metronidazole (500 mg TID) pending stool results and
discontinue this therapy if results are negative. Exception￾ally, we use oral vancomycin for this purpose (to avoid in￾teraction with CsA). Pronounced leucocytosis associated
with clostridial infection may indicate a higher severity
and require additional measures such as IV immunogolobin
(IVIG) [3].
Prophylactic viral medication is given on the basis of the
level of risk for cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr
virus (EBV) infection, which depends on the recipient/
donor status [27]. Patients at high-risk for CMV (recipient
negative/donor positive (-/+) for CMV) are treated imme￾diately postoperatively with IV ganciclovir (250 mg BID)
in combination with IVIG for the first 2–3 weeks, followed
by oral valganciclovir (450 mg BID). Intermediate risk
(+/+ and +/-) is covered initially with IV ganciclovir fol￾lowed by oral treatment. In low risk scenarios (-/-), we
use valaciclovir, which is effective against herpes viruses
other than CMV. IVIG is given in very high-risk constel￾lations and in case of CMV disease/reactivation. Should
cytopaenia (particularly leucopoenia) occur, or progressive
renal failure develops, the valganciclovir dosage is re￾duced. Patients at high risk for EBV infection (-/+) we treat
with valaciclovir (500 mg BID) if no valganciclovir is giv￾en (due to a high or intermediate risk for CMV). There is
limited evidence to suggest that this strategy prevents EBV￾related disease [28].
Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) is a
feared complication of profound immunosuppression in
LTRs. Most cases of PTLD are related to the EBV. The
major risk factor for PTLD is primary infection among in￾dividuals who are EBV-seronegative prior to transplant￾ation and whose source of infection is usually an EBV￾seropositive organ (EBV mismatch). The vast majority of
adult transplant candidates are EBV-seropositive, whereas
in children EBV-mismatch appears to be more prevalent
[28]. Passive immunoprophylaxis is accomplished by
providing of anti-EBV antibodies in the form of IVIG.
Chemoprophylaxis with available antivirals is not proven
beyond doubt to be efficacious. These antivirals do not
clearly affect EBV in its latent state nor influence prolifera￾tion of EBV-transformed B cells. The strategy of choice ap￾pears to be viral load monitoring and pre-emptive strategies
of prevention including reduction of immunosuppression
as initial step when viral load increases [28].
Primary prophylaxis of other herpesviruses such as herpes
simplx virus (HSV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is
achieved by the CMV prophylaxis, in our case val￾ganciclovir [29].
As a rule, we use a limited number of compounds we know
well and for which we have acquired considerable experi￾ence with the interaction patterns and their expected dose
adjustments, as recently published [15]. In addition, we aim
to administer all drugs required in the morning and even￾ing timeslots (12 hours apart), thus simplifying the process
for patients and aiming to increase compliance. In the early
postoperative period, the number of drugs is so high, so
that three to four timeslots for drug intake are required. An

exhaustive thesaurus of compounds we commonly use has
been published recently [18]. On the other hand, we have
compiled a list of drugs of which we discourage the use in
LTRs in an attempt to prevent complications (table 1).
Aspects to check on daily ward rounds
During ward rounds, the transplant team takes into account
all aspects related to the patients’ polymedication, which
allows for continuous adjustments of medication and op￾timisation of accompanying therapeutic measures: before
assessing the vital signs and clinical parameters at the bed￾side, we discuss laboratory and imaging results. The ICU
physician and nurse update the transplant team on the most
recent developments, and the further management plan is
then discussed. Aspects routinely discussed during this vis￾it are summarised in table 2. One issue that needs special
attention is intestinal motility, which frequently is reduced
by many factors (drugs, immobilisation, etc.). Since obstip￾ation or coprostasis generally remains asymptomatic or oli￾gosymptomatic initially, and complications are potentially
severe, we emphasise the need for daily bowel movements
from postoperative day 2 onwards, and therefore provide
adequate administration of laxatives. Osmoticly active lax￾atives (such as macrogolum 3350) and radiocontrast agents
(natrii amidotrizoas/meglumini amidotrizoas orally 20–40
ml three times daily) and, especially in CF patients, oral
high dose N-acetyl-cysteine (up to 5 g per dose, mixed
with orange juice to attenuate the bad smell/taste). With
this strategy we aim to prevent some of the early severe
gastrointestinal complications [30, 31].
Appropriate analgesia in the early postoperative phase is
crucial, and frequently opioids are indicated. In the ICU,
remifentanil or fentanyl are used in the first hours or days,
respectively. In awake patients morphine is titrated to the
individual needs by a patient controlled analgesia system.
The IV analgesics are discontinued when the recipient is
transferred to the regular ward in order to reduce opioid
adverse events. A combination of metamizole and
paracetamol at fixed intervals (3–4 times per day) is used
as baseline analgesia [32]. If pain control is insufficient, as
assessed with a visual analogue scale, oral opioids are giv￾en in addition: oxycodone/naloxone (10/5 mg) in a fixed
combination every twelve hours and oxycodone drops as
required. This regimen is constantly re-evaluated, with the
aim of a timely discontinuation whenever clinically pos￾sible. In protracted strong pain, we tend to add venlaflaxine
or trimipramine to raise the pain threshold.
For both psychiatric and/or psychological complications,
an experienced psychiatrist and psychologist are available
for intervention in the early postoperative phase, since
anxiety disorders, adaptation disorders, transient confusion
and depressive reactions require evaluation, support and
sometimes medication. For depression and frequent sleep
disorders we use sertraline, citalopram, trimipramine, mir￾tacepin and dipiperone [18]. Both the psychiatrist and the
psychologist take part in our interdisciplinary ward meet￾ing, where all LTRs are discussed in the presence of the
nurse in charge, the transplant team, and physiotherapist,
nutritionist and occupational therapist.
Antireflux measures are considered a high priority in the
early postoperative phase, with reverse Trendelenburg pos￾itioning of the patient at all times in order to prevent gastro￾oesophageal reflux and aspiration [33]. We do not specific￾ally investigate for reflux, since we assume that it is present
in all LTRs, who therefore receive prokinetic and antacid
medication as well as lifestyle advice on how to prevent re￾flux. It is not always feasible to maintain this tilt position
consistently on ICU when measurement of central venous
pressure in a horizontal position is required. We aim to re￾duce such measurements to a minimum if the patient’s con￾dition allows for it. In general, proton-pump inhibitors are
prescribed twice daily from immediately after transplant￾ation, as well as the prokinetic domperidone TID before
meals. Some centres perform reflux studies and fundoplic￾ation operations [34].
Fluid and weight management
LTRs frequently show a tendency to be fluid overloaded in
the first postoperative days, manifested by substantially in￾creased weight in most cases (typically 10%–15% increase
in body weight) and oedematous tissue typically in, but
not limited to, the lower limbs. Among other factors, early
postoperative hydration with IV fluid to prevent prerenal
kidney failure while on CNI therapy contributes [35]. We
aim for a careful negative fluid balance in this phase, with
cautious use of diuretics (not surpassing a weight reduction
of >1 kg/day). We provide protein-rich nutrition to most
LTRs since almost all our LTRs have documented hypoal￾buminaemia postoperatively. Lack of lymph drainage in the
transplanted lung additionally requires careful fluid man￾Table 1: Inappropriate medication for early postoperative treatment of lung transplant recipients.

Inappropriate medications are avoided in our setting. Rarely do we use these medications in situations where monitoring of interactions and adverse events can be
guaranteed. Some centres use some of these drugs with appropriate caution.

agement as the tendency to pulmonary oedema is increased
in LTRs. Physical measures such as bandaging or compres￾sion stockings are used. LTRs are informed that resolution
of leg oedema usually takes weeks and is enhanced by in￾creased mobility.
Low-dose heparin is given to all LTRs until discharge un￾less oral anticoagulation is required for thromboembolic
disease, arrhythmia or preoperatively diagnosed substantial
pulmonary hypertension. Both diuretics and CNIs increase
urinary magnesium excretion, thus magnesium needs to be
replaced routinely in order to maintain high normal ser￾um levels. The intracellular magnesium level may be low
despite normal serum levels. Magnesium is an essential
cofactor in numerous cellular functions that influence, for
example, muscle function and gastrointestinal motility. We
routinely measure electrolytes, kidney function, liver val￾ues, signs of infection/inflammation (C reactive protein
(CRP), selectively procalcitonin) and CsA levels (C0 and
C2), initially daily, in the stabilisation phase 3–4 times
weekly [36]. In addition, CMV and EBV viral load, using
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), as well as serum level
of itraconazole and MMF are measured weekly in the first
month after the transplant [37]. Immunglobulin levels in￾cluding subclasses are determined once postoperatively be￾fore administration of IVIG.
Chest imaging
Chest x-rays (CXRs) are useful to detect early and delayed
complications and to guide their resolution (table 23). In
unclear situations, we additionally perform chest computed
tomography (CT) (without contrast agent) to visualise un￾clear findings [38, 39]. A potentially fatal early postoper￾ative complications with suggestive features on CXR is
primary graft dysfunction, which may present as diffuse
pulmonary oedema and/or by mimicking an acute respir￾atory distress syndrome [3, 40, 41]. At our centre, we ini￾tially perform chest radiography every day (first week). On
average, two CXRs are taken per week in the 2
nd and 3
rd
week postoperatively, more frequently if clinically indic￾ated. The decision for thoracic imaging also depends on
the chest tube management. Removal of the drains is per￾formed if drainage <200 ml/24 h. Lung expansion and po￾tential new fluid collections have to be monitored. Chest
tube removal is a stepwise process depending on daily
chest tube drainage. Apical drains are removed first. The
correct drainage and fixation of remaining tubes has to be
checked by the transplant team daily on ward rounds.
Primary graft dysfunction has been defined as a triad of
worsening gas exchange, decreased lung compliance, and
alveolar and interstitial infiltrates typically most extensive
in perihilar regions, within the first 72 hours [42]. Differ￾ential diagnoses are acute rejection, infection, venous ana￾stomosis complications, and cardiogenic pulmonary oed￾ema. When primary graft dysfunction is diagnosed, we use
protective lung ventilation, cautious fluid management and
in severe cases inhaled nitric oxide (10–40 ppm) to reduce
hypoxia and elevated pulmonary arterial pressure. Poten￾tial drawbacks of inhaled nitric oxide are methaemoglobin￾aemia and cytotoxicity from free radical production [43].
If these strategies are insufficient, we use veno-venous ex￾tracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) [42].
Acute cellular rejection with lymphocyte-predominant in￾flammatory infiltrates around vessels and/or airways, oc￾curs rarely in the first month postoperatively. If infection
has been excluded by means of bronchoalveolar lavage,
and lung tissue samples obtained by transbronchial biopsy
show significant acute cellular rejection, we give high-dose
corticosteroid pulse treatment for 3 days (IV methylpred￾nisolone approximately 10 mg/kg/day). In the case of sus￾pected antibody-mediated rejection, we would additionally
provide low-dose IVIG (approximately 100 mg/kg as a
weekly dose, usually 10 g). Strategies to treat primary graft
dysfunction and acute rejection are variable and lack firm
evidence. For acute rejection, additional strategies such
as monoclonal antibodies, plasmapheresis, photophoresis,
total lymphoid radiation and change of CNI medication
have been used to influence the short- and long-term out￾comes.
Should signs of infection or inflammation (i.e. CRP eleva￾tion) occur without an apparent focus, it is advisable to pro￾actively search for the site of infection or inflammation by
performing broad sampling using a defined routine strategy
as “septic screen” [18, 44]. We have a low threshold for
replacing indwelling catheters (central or peripheral drip
lines) in particular if lines are in situ for longer than 7 days
[20, 45].

Stabilisation and patient education
phase on the ward
Once extubated, and depending on the course of the im￾mediate postoperative phase, LTRs are transferred as early
as day 2 to the regular transplant ward for further care.
The emphasis of management in the following days is
on fine-tuning immunosuppression, introducing additional
prophylactic medication, removal of all chest tubes, and in￾creasing physiotherapy and mobilisation. Education of pa￾tients regarding medication, lifestyle issues, self-monitor￾ing and self-management issues is described in our centre
as “teaching” (table 4).
When optimising the immunosuppression, the metabolic
interaction of other compounds has to be taken into ac￾count. The most important medications prone to interact
with immunosuppressants in this early postoperative phase
are itraconazole, esomeprazole and sometimes met￾ronidazole. These drugs generally increase CNI levels; thus
CNI doses need to be reduced and adjusted accordingly on
the basis of C0 and C2 levels. The CNI drug dose reduction
is generally by one-quarter to one-third after approximately
4 days.
Under the necessary profound immunosuppressive therapy,
wound healing is delayed so that removal of suture material
is in general postponed until week 3 postoperatively to al￾low for sufficient healing. In LTRs previously requiring
ECMO support, local wound healing complications at the
cannulation sites (inguinal, anterior chest wall or jugular
region) occur frequently: infection or lymphatic fistula
manifest as skin erythema or protracted secretion of lymph,
respectively. Sometimes conservative measures are insuffi￾cient so that surgical revisions have to be undertaken.
Despite seemingly optimal fluid management, LTRs in￾crease their bodyweight postoperatively, sometimes by
more than 10%, owing to fluid management, immobility,
inflammatory conditions and vascular leakiness resulting in
fluid accumulation in the third space, typically in the lower
extremities. Therefore, in the stabilisation phase, cautious
fluid management with consideration of the above-men￾tioned contributing factors in combination with careful use
of diuretics is mandatory to reduce the body weight, with
the aim of gradual weight loss by 1 kg /day. Certain drugs
appear to increase leakiness in our LTRs, which we there￾fore avoid particularly in this initial phase (calcium ant￾agonists, i.e. amlodipine, see table 1). Because of immob￾ility and increased risk of thromboembolic events, LTRs
receive prophylactic IV heparin (generally 10000 IU/24h)
from day 0 to the day of discharge unless specific reasons
exist to establish therapeutic anticoagulation (such as re￾cent thromboembolic events or severe pulmonary hyper￾tension preoperatively).
Fluid management may be complicated by heart failure,
which is sometimes due to atrial fibrillation. Atrial fib￾Table 3: Checklist and comments for intensive-care-unit and ward rounds visiting lung transplant patients.

rillation is common in the early postoperative phase and
can have a number of possible aetiologies [46]. During the
ICU stay artrial fibrillation is usually rapidly detected and
treated. Delayed onset atrial fibrillation may occur when
the LTR is in the regular ward. Therefore, any unexplained
heart failure, hypotension or tachycardia merits an elec￾trocardiogram. Besides the therapeutic anticoagulation and
correction of electrolyte levels, rhythm control is attemp￾ted first with metoprolol: if that is insufficient we give ami￾odarone [2]. Only when amiodarone is insufficient do we
perform electroconversion. Unlike others we do not use
digoxin because of its interaction profile.
Physiotherapy and home spirometry
Physiotherapy starts early during the ICU stay and focuses
on the positioning of the patient, ventilation of all lung
lobes and mobilisation of secretions by managing cough.
The slight reverse Trendelenburg position is maintained at
all times as part of the antireflux measures. Upright pos￾itioning of the patient and mobilisation out of the bed is
performed as soon as possible. Exercises to increase cardi￾orespiratory function (walking or cycle ergometry) follow
once some or all chest drains have been removed. Often pa￾tients have to be reminded that both the muscular and car￾diovascular systems need a more gradual increase in exer￾cise intensity as these systems have been underused as a
result of the limitations of the respiratory system. The main
aims of physiotherapy and the modalities used are sum￾marised in table 5. Besides a cycle ergometer, the Thera®
Band, a scarf-like latex band, is sometimes used to enhance
muscular function in this phase. It is useful when patients
are unable get up alone from bed because of general weak￾ness or multiple drains and infusion lines. LTRs receive
instructions for exercises they can perform alone between
daily physiotherapy sessions. Deep-breathing techniques
and the use of the home spirometry equipment is taught un￾less recent tracheostomy decannulation or closure was per￾formed. We then delay spirometry measurements by 7–10
days.
Home spirometry serves to measure and document forced
expiratory volume in one second (FEV1
) and forced vital
capacity (FVC) twice daily (best of three attempts), an
important part of the self-monitoring programme [47].
Whether once or twice daily spirometry is critical can be
debated. For this period, we believe it is beneficial since
repetition and supervision allows improvements in tech￾nique. The increase in lung function measurements in the
first weeks after the transplant serves often as strong mo￾tivator and indicator of success for LTRs. After discharge,
the measurements are used to track pulmonary function and
detect potential early deterioration before the patient sub￾jectively notices any dyspnoea during activities of daily
life. Recipients are instructed to contact the transplant team
if the FEV1 declines by 10% or more at two subsequent
timepoints. This will prompt investigation for signs of in￾fection and allograft rejection [18]. The first surveillance
bronchoscopy, with bronchial wash at the anastomotic re￾gions, bronchoalveolar lavage, and transbronchial biopsies,
is performed before discharge after transplantation. This
procedure is repeated monthly in the first half year and
serves to identify anastomotic problems, infections and
early signs of allograft dysfunction. Results help adjust im￾munosuppressive and anti-infective treatment. We do not
use protected brush specimen sampling. Timing of surveil￾lance bronchoscopies varies and many centres do not per￾form these in favour of clinically mandated bronchoscop￾ies. Both strategies have their merits [48].
Some patients have had a prolonged ICU stay before or
after transplantation. Critical illness polyneuropathy or my￾opathy may occur and frequently require long-term and
intensified physiotherapy as well as occupational therapy,
with the aim to improve both motor and sensory function
and to enable activities of daily living. In these patients,
we sometimes use incentive spirometry or the Acapella®
airways clearance device (Smiths Medical Inc, Carlsbad,
California, USA) to enhance lung expansion and mobilisa￾tion of secretions, respectively. Referral to inpatient rehab￾ilitation programmes is very rare and limited to these pa￾tients with critical illness polyneuropathy or sequelae of a
cerebrovascular event. All other LTRs are discharged home
and receive outpatient physiotherapy or rehabilitation.
Teaching self-monitoring and self￾treatment
To limit rehospitalisation and long-distance travel for pa￾tients, it has proved useful to instruct LTRs how to admin￾Table 4: Some teaching topics for lung transplant patients.
Medication issues All medications are explained, including adverse events
Importance of 12 hourly intake and simultaneous intake of drugs that interact with CsA (i.e. itraconazole,
clarithromycin, metronidazole).
Self-medication: laxative treatments, importance of sufficient fluid intake and increased intake when high
ambient temperatures, analgesia options, avoiding NSAIs and opioids.
Vomiting within 1 hour of drug intake (immunosuppressants), take them again and call transplant centre for
advice.
Nutritional issues and topics specific to cystic fibrosis Allowed and not allowed foods, rationale (list). Examples: grapefruit, raw meat and fish not allowed. Low
carbohydrate diet is explained for LTRs at risk of obesity
Cystic fibrosis: pancreatic enzyme substitution; fat-soluble vitamin substitution, laxative management,
procedures for cleaning nasal sinuses (Clyso pump, technique, rationale, hygiene), diabetes instruction.
Sun protection and persistent skin lesions Avoid outdoor activity between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. Sunscreen as daily cream. Hat with brim and long-arm/long￾leg cloths. Self-examination and importance of once yearly check-up in specialised dermatology clinic. Any
wound or skin lesion that does not resolve within 3 weeks needs to be shown to specialist.
Self-monitoring Home spirometry technique and documentation. instructed to call transplant team if FEV1 decreases by 10%
or more at two subsequent daily measurements. Weight and temperature documentation (elderly, cardiac
failure, obese, prone to infection). Blood pressure documentation.
CsA = cyclosporine A; NSAI = nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory; LTRs = lung transplant recipients; FEV1 = forced expiratory volume in 1 second.

ister IV antibiotics at home if indicated. After studying our
written instructions (specifically adapted to the self-therapy
situation), LTRs observe the nurses handling the infusions
and also perform the task under supervision by staff. Be￾fore giving permission to administer home IV treatment,
the transplant coordinators check the patients’ abilities to
perform the procedures safely and apply strict hygiene
rules.
This approach allows us to have an IV access put in by the
local healthcare provider with subsequent administration of
the antibiotics by the patients as previously instructed.
In general, instructing patients about general lifestyle is￾sues, self-monitoring and self-treatment is referred to as
“teaching” and is an important element in our postoperative
care. This information is partly given in writing, as a bro￾chure (No. 1) before definitive evaluation for lung trans￾plant, a further brochure (No. 2) during work-up for trans￾plantation associated with two or three teaching sessions,
and a final brochure (No. 3) after transplantation with at
least three teaching sessions given to two or three patients
(under exceptional circumstances individually) by the
transplant coordinator. Each session lasts 1–1.5 hours. Al￾though patients are instructed preoperatively about many
aspects of lung transplantation, these topics are covered
once again in depth after the procedure. Frequently, a re￾lative (parent, son or daughter) or partner is included in
these teaching sessions in order to provide optimal care
and support for the first months after discharge. This sup￾port person is especially important in the extremes of ages
(very young and old LTRs). Sometimes additional teaching
sessions are required when evaluation after three meetings
shows insufficient patient knowledge. For a number of
topics covered in greater detail during the teaching ses￾sions, LTRs receive preprinted paper with topics and space
provided to be filled in by the LTR during teaching.
Teaching topics cover a great number of themes of which
only the most important are mentioned here (table 5); many
aspects are centre-specific [49]. In our opinion, the follow￾ing aspects are also important: preparation of medication
dosing boxes for 7 days in advance, conservative antireflux
measures and maintaining a good intestinal function as key
to successful long-term allograft survival. We also emphas￾ise in what situations and how to contact the lung transplant
team at all times.
