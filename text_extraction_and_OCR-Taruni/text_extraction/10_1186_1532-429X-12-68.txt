Abstract
Desmin-related myopathy (DRM) is known to cause different types of cardiomyopathy. Late gadolinium
enhancement cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has been shown to identify fibrosis in ischemic and non￾ischemic cardiomyopathies. We present a rare case of desmin-related hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, CMR revealed
fibrosis in the lateral wall of the left ventricle. CMR is superior to conventional echocardiography for the detection
of myocardial fibrosis in desmin-related cardiomyopathy, which may be useful to detect early cardiac involvement
and predict the patient prognosis.
Background
Desmin is a primary element of the intermediate fila￾ment network in skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle
cells. Desmin-related myopathy (DRM) is an autoso￾mally inherited skeletal and cardiac muscular myopathy
mainly caused by mutations in the desmin gene [1].
DRM is characterized by progressive skeletal muscle
weakness, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac conduction dis￾ease. The cardiac phenotype of DRM includes cardiac
arrhythmias and different types of cardiomyopathy.
However, cardiac symptoms are the leading cause of
death in most patients [2]. Desmin-related cardiomyopa￾thy is usually evaluated by echocardiography through
functional and morphological changes. In recent years
however, cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) in
combination with late gadolinium enhancement (LGE)
imaging has been used to differentiate normal myocar￾dium from a variety of myocardial diseases associated
with necrosis or fibrosis. We describe a case of desmin￾related hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with myocardial
fibrosis detected by CMR, which has not been previously
reported.
Case report
A 16 year old female presented to our cardiac depart￾ment with progressive exertional dyspnea, palpitation,
and skeletal muscle weakness for about two years. Two
years ago she was diagnosed with hypertrophic cardio￾myopathy by echocardiography. Her laboratory data
showed creatine kinase (CK) 996 HU/L, brain natriuretic
peptide(BNP) 2634 Hpg/ml. The electrocardiogram
showed atrial fibrillation. At the referring hospital,
skeletal muscle biopsies and mutation screening of the
desmin gene had been performed according to the
neurological workup of pathology.
Tranthoracic echocardiography showed symmetrical
myocardial hypertrophy of interventricular septum and
the wall of left ventricle. The wall motion was normal.
Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 66%, left
ventricular (LV) diastolic (DD) and systolic (SD) dia￾meter was 40 and 26 mm, respectively. The left atrium
(LA) was dilated with diameter of 56 mm.
CMR was performed with a 1.5T Magnetom Sonata
(Siemens Medical Systems). Fast-gradient-echo steady￾state free precession cine demonstrated symmetrical
wall thicken of interventricular septum and the lateral
wall of left ventricle (Figure 1a). The left atrium was
enlarged. Global and regional wall motion was normal
(LVEF 63%), in particular no segmental wall motion
abnormality in the affected wall was observed. For myo￾cardial tissue characterization, LGE imaging was per￾formed with Gadolinium (Gd)-DTPA 0.2 mmol/kg BW
(Magnevist, Bayer Schering Pharma, Berlin, Germany).
The inversion recovery (IR) prepared 2-dimensional tur￾boflash imaging revealed marked intramyocardial
enhancement in the lateral LV wall (Figure 1b) indicat￾ing myocardial fibrosis.

The histopathological study of skeletal muscle was in
line with the pathological pictures of desminopathy.
Modified Gomori staining (MGT) showed multiple dark
blue materials depositing in muscle fibers (Figure 2a),
which were strong immunoreactivity to desmin antibody
(Figure 2b). In addition, gene screening revealed a
c.338_339delA_G deletion mutation in exon 1 of the
desmin gene in this patient. This mutation caused a
truncated protein at codon 115 (Q113fsX115) in the
helix 1A domain (Figure 3).
Discussion
Desmin is the main intermediate filament protein
expressed in skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle [3]. It
interacts with other proteins to form a continuous
cytoskeletal network that maintains a spatial relationship
between the contractile apparatus and other structural
elements of the cell, thus providing maintenance of cel￾lular integrity, force transmission, and mechanochemical
signaling. Primary desminopathies are caused by muta￾tions in the desmin gene. This disease is characterized
by an intracellular accumulation of insoluble protein
aggregates eventually leading to cell death and replace￾ment fibrosis [4].
The clinical manifestationsis of desminopathies are
quite broad including progressive skeletal myopathy,
typically presents with lower and later with upper limb
muscle weakness, sometimes slowly spreading to involve
truncal, neck flexor, facial and respiratory muscles [5,6].
Different types of cardiomyopathy are also seen includ￾ing dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), restrictive cardio￾myopathy (RCM), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)
and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy
(TRVC); Cardiac arrhythmias include various degrees of
atrioventricular conduction block, and supraventricular
and ventricular tachyarrhythmias.
Desmin-related cardiomyopathy is usually diagnosed
with echocardiography through characteristically func￾tional and morphological changes. Cardiomyopathy has
been reported in up to 50% of desmin gene mutation
carriers, with DCM and RCM being the most prevalent
form, but HCM has seldom been reported. In recent
years, CMR has evolved as the non-invasive reference
standard for accurate and highly reproducible determi￾nation of cardiac function and morphology. But the
study of desmin-related cardiomyopathy with CMR is
really rare. Only one study systematically used CMR
imaging to evaluate myocardial involvement in desmino￾pathies. It revealed subtle focal hypertrophic myocardial
changes in two desmin-related cardiomyopathy patients
which were missed by echocardiography [7]. The reason
may due to the high spatial resolution and clear delinea￾tion of endocardial borders of CMR, making it more
sensitive for the detection of global and focal LV pathol￾ogies and subtle change of cardiac morphology than

echocardiology that sometimes affected by limited
acoustic windows.
Another important finding of CMR is the detection of
fibrotic intramyocardial lesions by LGE imaging. It is
the only direct and noninvasive imaging technique
which can find myocardial fibrosis in cardiomyopathy.
The finding of myocardial fibrosis is especially note￾worthy since some desmin-related cardiomyopathies
with myocardial fibrosis were not associated with global
or focal systolic wall motion abnormalities and therefore
might be missed by wall motion studies. The extent of
myocardial fibrosis has been related to patient prog￾nosis, including worsening of LV function and adverse
outcome [8].
In conclusion, CMR was able to detect myocardial fibro￾sis in desmin-related hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. CMR
may prove useful to detect early cardiac involvement and
predict the patient prognosis of desminopathies.
