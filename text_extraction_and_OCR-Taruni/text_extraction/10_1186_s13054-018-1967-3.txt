Abstract
Vasoplegia is a ubiquitous phenomenon in all advanced shock states, including septic, cardiogenic, hemorrhagic,
and anaphylactic shock. Its pathophysiology is complex, involving various mechanisms in vascular smooth muscle
cells such as G protein-coupled receptor desensitization (adrenoceptors, vasopressin 1 receptors, angiotensin type 1
receptors), alteration of second messenger pathways, critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency, and
increased production of nitric oxide. This review, based on a critical appraisal of the literature, discusses the main
current treatments and future approaches. Our improved understanding of these mechanisms is progressively
changing our therapeutic approach to vasoplegia from a standardized to a personalized multimodal treatment with
the prescription of several vasopressors. While norepinephrine is confirmed as first line therapy for the treatment of
vasoplegia, the latest Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines also consider that the best therapeutic management of
vascular hyporesponsiveness to vasopressors could be a combination of multiple vasopressors, including
norepinephrine and early prescription of vasopressin. This new approach is seemingly justified by the need to limit
adrenoceptor desensitization as well as sympathetic overactivation given its subsequent deleterious impacts on
hemodynamics and inflammation. Finally, based on new pathophysiological data, two potential drugs, selepressin
and angiotensin II, are currently being evaluated.

Background
Definition(s) of vasoplegia
Known as “vasodilatory shock”, this condition includes
multiple and diverse etiologies (e.g., septic, cardiogenic,
neurogenic, and anaphylactic shock) and ultimately results
in uncontrolled vasodilation, otherwise termed “vasople￾gia”. The pathophysiology of vasoplegia is multifactorial
and includes activation of several intrinsic vasodilatory
pathways and a vascular hyporesponsiveness to vasopres￾sors [1]. Vasoplegia occurring post-surgery is called post￾operative vasoplegic syndrome or vasoplegic syndrome. In
clinical practice, vasoplegia can be assessed clinically by
the vasopressor dosage necessary to maintain mean arter￾ial blood pressure (MAP) and by the drop in diastolic
blood pressure reflecting vasoplegia [2]. Invariably, the
necessity to use a high-dose vasopressor is highly indica￾tive of vasoplegia, especially in the case of normal cardiac
function. For further details, the reader is invited to con￾sult the pathophysiological article published in the same
series.
However, vascular responsiveness to vasopressors is
probably better suited than vasoplegia for characterizing
the state of vessels during shock. While the term vasopla￾gia refers to the static diameter of the vessel in response
to specific intra-luminal and transmural pressures, vascu￾lar responsiveness to vasopressors refers to the dynamic
response of the vessel to endogenous and/or exogenous
vasoconstrictor agents [1].
The present review was written based on a critical and
personal appraisal of the literature. It focuses only on
treatment-based pathophysiology of vasoplegia and the
benefits or drawbacks of each associated therapeutic
option for all types of shock, irrespective of their origin.
Nevertheless, there is a clear lack of data with regard to
vasoplegia treatments in non-septic shock.

Vasoplegia occurs in all shock states
Although initially ascribed to septic shock, it is now
apparent that the majority of mechanisms explaining or
associated with vascular hyporesponsiveness to vasopres￾sors (inflammation, nitric oxide (NO), potassium and
calcium channels, adrenomedullin, and free radicals) are also
common to hemorrhagic shock, cardiogenic shock (includ￾ing in post-cardiopulmonary bypass patients), anaphylactic
shock, and, more generally, during ischemia-reperfusion,
such as cardiac arrest or multiple trauma [3–5].
A treatment-based pathophysiological approach
to vascular hyporesponsiveness to vasopressors
Here, we limit our description to the pathophysiological
mechanisms involved in vascular hyporesponsiveness to
vasopressors where treatments are currently available or
soon will be. Thus, certain crucial mechanisms have
been omitted, although they are described elsewhere in
this series of articles on vasoplegia. The following three
levels will be described: central (neuro-immune communi￾cation), cellular (G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)),
and intracellular (alteration of second messenger path￾ways) (Fig. 1).
Neuro-immune communication
Shock states are primarily associated with a concomitant
initial activation of the sympathetic system in the locus
coeruleus and the hypothalamic pituitary-adrenal axis in
the paraventricular nucleus by stimulation of baro- and
chemoreceptors and inflammatory cytokines such as
tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α, interleukin (IL)-1 and IL￾6. These two systems are both co-activated such that
activation of one also tends to activate the other. Conse￾quences include the release of norepinephrine from
sympathetic nerve extremities in lymphoid organs, epi￾nephrine from the adrenal medulla, and cortisol from
the adrenal cortex. Of note, vasopressin release is also
under the control of baro- and chemoreceptors charac￾terizing the autonomic system [6]. Moreover, vasopressin
also increases the activation of the hypothalamic
pituitary-adrenal axis [7]. Finally, vasopressin and angio￾tensin II interact synergistically at a peripheral level in
vascular smooth muscle in order to increase calcium
concentrations [8]. Together, all of these systems partici￾pate in the maintenance of vascular responsiveness,
particularly during the initial stage of shock state.
Sustained activation of the sympathetic system is associ￾ated with dysautonomia, a syndrome characterized by loss
of cardiovascular variability with inappropriate tachycardia,
excessively elevated catecholamine levels with concomitant
adrenoceptor desensitization, and pro-inflammatory states
leading to poor outcome [9]. This triad participates in
vascular hyporesponsiveness to vasopressors during
shock states.
G-protein-coupled receptors
The three major receptors (adrenergic, vasopressin 1
(V1), and angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptors) involved
in the regulation of vascular tone are GPCRs. During
shock states, adrenergic, V1, and AT1 receptors undergo
similar desensitization processes. Sustained agonist acti￾vation such as in the initial phase of shock is associated
with phosphorylation of GPCRs by GPCR kinases
(GRKs). This process appears to be activated early, even
following transient agonist stimulation, and is a major
cause of vascular hyporesponsiveness to the three major
vasopressors. The decreasing affinity of α adrenergic
receptors for various molecules such as endotoxin is
known to enhance desensitization [10]. AT1 receptors
are downregulated within the first hours after experi￾mental septic shock. This process is associated with low
blood pressure and low systemic vascular resistance [11].
However, others have also demonstrated that AT1 recep￾tors are primarily downregulated, although not by their
agonist but rather through deficient expression of the
AT1 receptor-associated protein Arap1. Arap1 is known
to enhance the transport of the AT1 receptor from
endosomes to the plasma membrane [12]. Finally, V1
receptors appear to be less sensitive to agonistic stimula￾tion due to low circulating concentrations of vasopressin
in blood even during shock states [7]. After an initial
increase in concentration at shock onset, a decrease in
vasopressin plasma levels is most often observed [13].
Alteration of second messenger pathways
In addition to the desensitization process, other mecha￾nisms are also highly involved in vascular hyporesponsive￾ness to vasopressors. For instance, expression of inducible
nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is enhanced during shock
states in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) while NO
production is increased a thousand-fold. Endotoxin and
proinflammatory cytokines increase iNOS expression and
NO production [14]. NO activates cyclic guanosine mono￾phosphate (cGMP) production as well as calcium-sensitive
potassium channels, potassium ATP channels, and myosin
light chain phosphatase, all of which contribute to
vasodilation [15]. Other mechanisms equally involved
in vasodilatation include prostacyclin and cyclooxygen￾ase 2 (COX2) pathways, although with no currently
known positive therapeutic consequences [16].
Critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI),
which occurs in 50 % of septic shock patients, has a major
impact on vascular hyporesponsiveness to vasopressors [17].
Involved mechanisms include insufficient synthesis of corti￾sol, tissue resistance to cortisol, and an excessive proinflam￾matory response. Injuries are observed at all levels of the
hypothalamo-hypopituitary axis. Adrenocorticotropic hor￾mone (ACTH) secretion may be impaired by shock-induced
anatomical lesions of the pituitary axis [18]. It has also long
Levy et al. Critical Care (2018) 22:52 Page 2 of 11

been known that adrenal necrosis and/or hemorrhage may
be due to shock state and particularly septic shock [18].
Tissue resistance has multifactorial causes involving, among
others, downregulation of glucocorticoid receptor α at the
tissue level and reduction of cortisol delivery to septic
locations. Excessive proinflammatory secretion also im￾pacts ACTH secretion. Thus, TNFα and IL-1, massively
released during septic shock, downregulate ACTH and
cortisol production.
Consequences of CIRCI on hemodynamic parame￾ters during shock states are extensive with vascular
hyporesponsiveness to phenylephrine and low blood pres￾sure. Underlying mechanisms involve disinhibition of
NF-κB with upregulation of iNOS responsible for NO
over-production.
Vasoplegia treatment
The use of adrenergic vasopressors
Vascular hyporeactivity-associated hypotension is clearly
associated, both significantly and independently, with mor￾tality [19]. After volume resuscitation, the use of catechol￾amines is considered to be the cornerstone of septic shock
Fig. 1 The principal mechanisms involved in the regulation of vascular tone during vasoplegia as well as treatment options at the central, cellular, and
intracellular levels. Central level. Inflammatory triggers such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNF, interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 activate the neuro-immune system.
This activation leads to norepinephrine, epinephrine, cortisol, vasopressin, and indirectly angiotensin II production in order to counteract vasoplegia.
Overactivation of this system may be treated at this integrative level with α2 agonists and selective β1 blockers. Cellular level. G-protein-coupled receptors
are predominantly involved in vascular smooth muscle cell contraction: α1 adrenoceptors (α1AR), vasopressin 1 receptors (V1R), and angiotensin type 1
receptors (AT-R1). These receptors activate phospholipase C (PLC) with generation of inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) from
phosphatidyl inositol 4,5 bisphosphate (PiP2). DAG stimulates protein kinase C (PKC), which in turn activates voltage-sensitive calcium channels, while IP3
activates sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium channels. α1ARs increase intracellular calcium by receptor-operated calcium channels (ROCC)
stimulation. Available treatments at this level are epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, phenylephrine, selepressin, vasopressin (V1),
and angiotensin II. Adrenomedullin primarily acts on endothelial cells. Intracellular level. Translocation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) into the
nucleus induces pro-inflammatory cytokine production. These cytokines enhance inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and
overproduction of NO. This molecule activates cyclic guanosine monophosphate production as a mediator of vasodilation. Available
treatments at this level are glucocorticoids (at different steps), β1 blockade, and methylene blue. Vascular sensitive calcium channel (VSCC)

hemodynamic treatment [20]. This therapeutic class
includes dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and
phenylephrine. All of these molecules increase MAP
by stimulating the α1 adrenergic receptor. Neverthe￾less, aside from phenylephrine, all of the above cate￾cholamines stimulate other adrenergic receptors, leading
to various hemodynamic, metabolic, and inflammatory ef￾fects [21, 22]. Comparison of the affinity of these different
drugs for receptor subtypes as well as the effects associ￾ated with receptor stimulation is depicted in Table 1.
Hence, the choice of best adrenergic vasopressor
should take into account not only its vasopressor ef￾fect but also its cardiac, metabolic, microcirculatory,
and immune effects.
The current recommendations
A recent Cochrane analysis concluded that there was
not sufficient evidence to prove that any one vasopressor
was superior to others in terms of mortality and that the
choice of a specific vasopressor may, therefore, be indi￾vidualized and left to the discretion of treating physi￾cians [23]. Despite low levels of evidence, the Surviving
Sepsis Campaign (SSC) published several recommenda￾tions based on the physiological effects of vasopressors
and selection of inotrope/vasopressor combinations in
septic shock outlined in an extensive number of literature
reviews [20].
Norepinephrine as a first line-agent
Norepinephrine is a very potent and reliable vasopressor.
It increases MAP without any concomitant increase in
heart rate. Generally, cardiac index is increased due to
both a rise in end-diastolic stroke volume through a
mobilization of splanchnic unstressed volume and to a
direct effect on cardiac myocytes due to β1 adrenergic
receptor stimulation [24]. Norepinephrine has numerous
advantages when compared to other vasopressors, in￾cluding: a) a very potent vasopressor effect equivalent to
epinephrine and phenylephrine and higher than dopa￾mine [25]; b) contrary to epinephrine, norepinephrine
does not act on β2 adrenergic receptors—hence, lactate
levels do not increase and may be used to guide resusci￾tation [26]; c) contrary to dopamine and epinephrine,
norepinephrine increases cardiac index without increas￾ing heart rate and thus without excessively increasing
myocardial oxygen consumption [27]; d) contrary to
phenylephrine, which acts only on α1 adrenergic recep￾tors, norepinephrine also acts on cardiac β1 adrenergic
receptors and may therefore preserve ventricular–arterial
coupling [28].
Finally, adrenergic vasopressors have potential side ef￾fects such as increased oxidative stress, interaction with
cellular energy metabolism, and/or modulation of the
inflammatory response [22]. As a result, a new concept
has emerged called “decatecholaminization”, which con￾sists in using non-catecholamine vasopressors in order
to decrease catecholamine exposure [29].
Vasopressin as a second line agent or a catecholamine￾sparing agent
Patients with severe septic shock often require very high
doses of norepinephrine in order to achieve the target
MAP, thereby potentially leading to adverse side effects
[30]. The SSC suggests adding either vasopressin (up to
0.03 U/min; weak recommendation, moderate quality of
evidence) to norepinephrine with the intent of raising MAP
to target, or adding vasopressin (up to 0.03 U/min; weak
recommendation, moderate quality of evidence) to decrease
norepinephrine dosage. The rationale for vasopressin use is
that there is a relative vasopressin deficiency in septic shock
such that addition of exogenous vasopressin restores vascu￾lar tone by acting on non-adrenergic receptors, increases
blood pressure, thereby reducing norepinephrine require￾ments, and possibly has favorable effects on cytokine pro￾duction [31–33]. Globally, vasopressin is as effective as
norepinephrine in increasing MAP and, when used in com￾bination with norepinephrine, low vasopressin doses have a
norepinephrine-sparing effect. The VASST study, in which
vasopressin was used in substitutive doses (< 0.04 U/min),
showed no overall improvement in mortality [34]. In a
post-hoc analysis, however, patients with less severe septic
shock (i.e., < 15 μg.min−1 of norepinephrine) at vasopressin
initiation had a lower 28-day mortality rate compared with
norepinephrine-only infusion (26.5 vs 35.7 %; p = 0.05).
Higher doses of vasopressin have been associated with
cardiac, digital, and splanchnic ischemia and should be re￾served for situations in which alternative vasopressors have
failed [35]. The VANCS trial compared norepinephrine to
vasopressin in treating vasoplegia syndrome after cardiac
surgery [36]. The primary endpoint was a composite of
mortality or severe complications (stroke, requirement for
mechanical ventilation for longer than 48 h, deep sternal
wound infection, reoperation, or acute renal failure)
within 30 days. The primary outcome occurred in 32 %
of vasopressin patients compared to 49 % of norepin￾ephrine patients (unadjusted hazard ratio 0.55; 95 % CI
0.38 to 0.80; p = 0.0014). With regard to adverse events,
the authors found a lower occurrence of atrial fibrilla￾tion in the vasopressin group (63.8 vs 82.1 %; p =
0.0004) and no difference between groups with regard
to rates of digital ischemia, mesenteric ischemia, hypo￾natremia, or myocardial infarction. These results thus
suggest that vasopressin can be used as a first-line vaso￾pressor agent in postcardiac surgery vasoplegic shock
and improves clinical outcomes. Lastly, the VANISH
study, assessing vasopressin versus norepinephrine with
or without adding hydrocortisone (factorial 2X2 study)
as initial therapy in septic shock, demonstrated no

improvement in the number of kidney failure-free days
[37]. Addition of hydrocortisone as an adjunct in the two
vasopressor groups was used to upregulate receptor ex￾pression on VSMCs and to enhance anti-inflammatory
effects.
Terlipressin, a long acting vasopressin analog with pre￾dominant V1 receptor activity, has also been proposed.
When compared to norepinephrine, terlipressin signifi￾cantly reduced catecholamine requirements, and led to
fewer rebound hypotension events, without increasing bili￾rubin levels [38]. There is still ongoing debate regarding its
ideal dose and mode of administration (continuous infu￾sion despite long half-life or intermittent administration).
Notwithstanding, terlipressin may result in pulmonary
vasoconstriction and affect coagulation systems whereas
vasopressin does not [38]. Hence, terlipressin is not consid￾ered to offer a greater advantage compared to vasopressin
due to its longer half-life and clinical evidence that sup￾ports its use in circulatory shock remains scarce [20]. In
spite of these caveats, the place of terlipressin is currently
being evaluated in two ongoing studies (NCT03038503
and NCT02468063).
Phenylephrine use should be limited
Phenylephrine is a pure α1 adrenergic agonist for which
clinical trial data are limited. It has the potential to pro￾duce splanchnic vasoconstriction. Moreover, in a model
of rat septic shock, phenylephrine use has been associ￾ated with a detrimental effect on intrinsic cardiac func￾tion [39]. Lastly, among patients with septic shock in US
hospitals affected by the 2011 norepinephrine shortage,
Vail et al. [40] found that the most commonly adminis￾tered alternative vasopressor was phenylephrine. Patients
admitted to these hospitals during times of shortage had
higher in-hospital mortality.
A critical view of the recommendations
Two recommendations should be addressed. The first rec￾ommendation concerns the use of epinephrine as a
second-line agent and the second regards the use of dopa￾mine in highly selected patients. The relevance of using
epinephrine in association with norepinephrine should be
discussed since a) epinephrine markedly increases lactate
levels and may therefore preclude the use of lactate clear￾ance to guide resuscitation [25], b) norepinephrine and
epinephrine both act on α1 adrenergic receptors so there is
no therapeutic value in adding the same molecule type
when norepinephrine has failed to increase MAP, and c)
the combination of norepinephrine and dobutamine,
allowing the separate titration of vasopressor and inotropic
effects, is more logical than using epinephrine alone.
Therefore, we firmly believe that epinephrine has no place
in septic shock treatment with the exception of countries
with limited resources (it is cheaper than norepinephrine).
In these countries, it is acceptable to use epinephrine since
no data support a difference in efficacy, mortality, or mor￾bidity [29, 41]. With regard to dopamine, there is currently
ample evidence that norepinephrine or epinephrine is
more efficient in restoring MAP and that both drugs could
be used through a peripheral venous access [42, 43]. Thus,
dopamine should no longer be used in septic shock. More￾over, in a randomized study comparing dopamine and epi￾nephrine in the treatment of shock, a subgroup analysis of
280 patients with cardiogenic shock showed dopamine to
be associated with an increase in 28-day mortality com￾pared to norepinephrine [27].
The future
Selepressin, an improved vasopressin receptor agonist?
Since vasopressin comparably stimulates all vasopressin re￾ceptor subtypes (i.e., V1a, V1b, and V2 receptors), it may
also have serious undesirable side effects through V2
stimulation (fluid accumulation, microvascular thrombosis,
vasodilation) [44]. Selepressin, a short-acting selective V1a
receptor agonist, may overcome these disadvantages [45].
Furthermore, selepressin does not induce release of the
procoagulant Willebrand factor [46]. In a study by May￾bauer et al. [47] describing the effects of selepressin in an
ovine model of severe sepsis, the effects of V1a and V2
receptor activation were compared using selective V1a
(selepressin) and V2 (desmopressin) receptor agonists. Ac￾cumulation of fluid was blunted by arginine vasopressin
while reversed by selepressin. When selepressin was com￾bined with desmopressin, fluid accumulation was restored
to levels similar to the sepsis + vasopressin group. These
findings were also confirmed by He et al. [48], who found
that early administration of selepressin as first line vaso￾pressor treatment improved MAP, cardiac index, blood
lactate levels, lung edema, and fluid balance and was asso￾ciated with higher survival rates compared to vasopressin
and norepinephrine. In light of the above, several com￾pleted or currently ongoing clinical trials are investigating
the clinical implications of selepressin. The prelimin￾ary results of two phase II trials (NCT01612676 and
NCT01000649) showed that selepressin enabled the
dose requirements of norepinephrine to be reduced. In
addition, incremental doses of selepressin were found to re￾duce overall excessive fluid balance and were associated
with higher rates of ventilator-free days, shock resolution,
and patient survival within the first 7 days [49]. Accord￾ingly, an ongoing double-blinded phase IIB/III, randomized
clinical trial (NCT02508649) is studying the effects of sele￾pressin compared to placebo on ventilator and vasopressor￾free days.
Angiotensin II
Activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system
leads to angiotensin II production [50]. Angiotensin II
Levy et al. Critical Care (2018) 22:52 Page 6 of 11

acts by binding to specific GPCRs, namely AT1 and AT2
[51]. The main hemodynamic effects mediated by AT1
receptor activation include vasoconstriction, aldosterone
secretion, vasopressin release, and cardiac remodeling
[52]. In the ATHOS-3 study, patients with vasodilatory
shock who were receiving more than 0.2 μg.kg−1
.min−1
of norepinephrine or the equivalent dose of another
vasopressor were assigned to receive infusions of either
angiotensin II or placebo [53]. The primary end point
was MAP response at 3 h after initiation of infusion, with
response defined as an increase from baseline of at least
10 mmHg or an increase to at least 75 mmHg, without an
increase in dose of background vasopressors. The primary
endpoint was reached by more patients in the angiotensin
II group than in the placebo group (p < 0.001). At 48 h,
the mean improvement in the cardiovascular Sequential
Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was greater in
the angiotensin II group than in the placebo group (p =
0.01). Serious adverse events were reported in 60.7 % of
the patients in the angiotensin II group and in 67.1 % in
the placebo group. Death by day 28 occurred in 75/163
patients (46 %) in the angiotensin II group and in 85/158
patients (54 %) in the placebo group (p = 0.12).
Methylene blue
Inhibition of excessive production and activity of both NO
and cGMP may be critical in the treatment of refractory
vasodilatory shock occurring in cardiac bypass, septic
shock, poisoning, and anaphylaxis patients. Methylene
blue (MB) has several actions that may counteract the ef￾fect of increased NOS stimulation. First, it may antagonize
endothelial NOS activity. Furthermore, it may scavenge
NO directly and inhibit guanylate cyclase activity [54].
Experimental animal studies report that, in addition to a
reduction in vasopressor requirements, inotropic support
is reduced after the administration of MB, likely due to at￾tenuation of ischemia/reperfusion injury [55]. In a human
septic shock study, MAP and cardiac index were both
found to be increased [56]. A systematic review of the
literature regarding the use of MB in sepsis by Kwok and
Howes [57] concluded that, while the studies were mostly
observational, MB increased systemic vascular resistances
and MAP; however, its effects on oxygen delivery and
mortality are unknown. Moreover, all of the aforemen￾tioned studies are relatively old and likely do not take into
account current recommendations.
The use of MB has been proposed not only for septic
shock but also for treating vasoplegia after cardiac sur￾gery, drug poisoning, anaphylactic shock, and post￾reperfusion syndrome after liver transplantation [54].
Similar to septic shock, however, data are currently in￾sufficient to propose MB as a first line agent [58].
The potential dangers of treatments targeting iNOS
overexpression in septic shock should nonetheless be
kept in mind. For example, non-selective iNOS blockers,
while improving systemic vascular resistance and MAP,
also reduce cardiac output and increase mortality in pa￾tients with septic shock [59]. Similarly, non-selective
iNOS inhibition with tilarginine versus placebo in car￾diogenic shock patients failed to reduce the mortality
rate at 30 days [60]. Interestingly, there was also no
difference in hemodynamic outcomes such as duration
of shock. This negative result may be the consequence
of the inhibition of other beneficial NO isoforms [61].
Despite these limitations, the place of MB in vasoplegia
treatment is currently being evaluated in a number
of ongoing studies (NCT03038503, NCT01797978,
NCT03120637).
Potential new strategies
Very high doses of norepinephrine
Depending on the study, high doses of norepinephrine
associated with excess mortality have been defined by a
cut-off value ranging from 0.5 to 2 μg.kg−1
.min−1
,
although converging evidence has recently confirmed
the cut-off as 1 μg.kg− 1
.min− 1 [30, 62]. Obviously, the
level of MAP that is targeted should be taken into account.
Because these very high doses may be associated with
potential deleterious effects, there is still controversy
regarding increasing vasopressor dosage when conven￾tional therapy fails to increase mean arterial pressure to
the recommended target. The pharmacodynamic effects of
catecholamines are characterized by a linear increase in ef￾fect, which is dependent on the logarithmic increase of the
concentration, without any saturation at high doses [63].
Auchet et al. [62] found that a vasopressor dose higher
than 0.75 μg.kg− 1
.min− 1 was associated with a mortality
of 86 % in patients with a SOFA score > 10 and with a
mortality of 58 % in patients with a SOFA score < 10.
Moreover, the administration of high doses should be
stopped in instances of serious adverse events. In two
studies, myocardial, mesenteric, and digital ischemia oc￾curred in less than 10 % of patients [62, 64]. Moreover,
adding an additional vasopressor (vasopressin) in order
to reduce norepinephrine dosage was not associated
with a lower incidence of serious adverse events [64].
As a result, physicians should also consider an increase
in norepinephrine dosage as a possible therapeutic op￾tion in instances of refractory hypotension associated
with vasoplegia and adequate cardiac function, without
the fear of ischemic complications.
Modulation of the sympathetic system
α2 Agonists
During a shock state, the inappropriate activation of the sym￾pathetic system is associated with receptor desensitization
[65]. One innovative approach may be to reduce sympathetic
activity. α2 Agonists such as clonidine or dexmedetomidine
Levy et al. Critical Care (2018) 22:52 Page 7 of 11

(200 times more powerful than clonidine) act directly in the
locus cœruleus. By binding to presynaptic α2 adrenergic re￾ceptors, these agonists also induce a negative feedback on
norepinephrine secretion. Known pharmacological effects of
this central down-regulation are hypotension, bradycardia,
and sedation [66]. However, recent experimental stud￾ies in small and large animals have found that adminis￾tration of α2 agonists, by reducing central sympathetic
activity, also restores the response to vasoconstrictors
such as α1 agonists or angiotensin II [67, 68]. One ap￾pealing hypothesis is that the reduction in sympathetic
outflow allows a lesser desensitization of peripheral
adrenergic receptors as well as a reduction in pro￾inflammatory cytokine secretion. Direct vasoconstrictor
effects of α2 agonists should also be taken into account.
Selective β1 blockade
β1 Blockade seemingly restores vascular responsiveness
to vasopressors. In 2013, Morelli et al. [69] demon￾strated that esmolol, a selective β1 blocker, administered
in hemodynamically stabilized septic shock patients, effi￾ciently reduced heart rate without apparent side effects. Of
greater interest, the authors observed a decrease in the dose
of norepinephrine infused in the esmolol group compared
to the placebo group. There are two prevailing hypotheses
to explain this unexpected result on norepinephrine dose.
First, in 2016, Morelli et al. [70] found that, in septic shock
patients under esmolol, the decrease in heart rate was asso￾ciated with improved arterial elastance, thus restoring ven￾tricular–arterial coupling. Second, our team recently found
that in experimental septic shock, esmolol infusion in rats,
even at low doses that did not induce a reduction in heart
rate, was associated with a better ex vivo vasoreactivity
compared to non-treated animals. These beneficial effects
appear to be associated with a downregulation of inflamma￾tory pathways in vessels such as NF-κB [71].
Perspectives in adrenergic modulation could include
both central reduction of sympathetic outflow by α2 ago￾nists and peripheral downregulation of β1 adrenergic re￾ceptors by selective β1 blocker. Accordingly, Hernandez et
al. [72] recently published an experimental study in which
they compared the effects of dexmedetomidine and esmo￾lol relative to lipopolysaccharide-control animals on ex￾ogenous lactate clearance in a sheep model of early
endotoxic shock. The authors found that these two mole￾cules were hemodynamically well tolerated and were asso￾ciated with better exogenous lactate clearance. Correct
dosages and hemodynamic tolerances of the combination
of these two molecules nonetheless remain to be explored.
Glucocorticoids
Many experimental studies have demonstrated that admin￾istration of glucocorticoids restores vascular responsiveness
to vasopressors, likely through a non-genomic inhibition of
the arachidonic acid cascade and a genomic inhibition of
the nuclear translocation of the NF-κB transcription factor
[73]. Moreover, glucocorticoids also inhibit the synthesis of
iNOS and COX2 [74, 75]. Finally, low doses of glucocorti￾coids appear to restore vascular responsiveness to norepin￾ephrine through an increase in α adrenergic receptor gene
expression [76]. A clinical trial demonstrated that adminis￾tration of low doses of hydrocortisone in septic shock pa￾tients tended to normalize the vascular responsiveness to
phenylephrine [73]. However, results of a large clinical trial
assessing the efficiency of low doses of hydrocortisone on
mortality in septic shock patients yielded conflicting find￾ings. Consequently, the SSC recommends against treating
septic shock with low intravenous doses of hydrocor￾tisone if hemodynamic fluids and catecholamines are
able to restore stability. However, in the case of re￾fractory septic shock, low doses of hydrocortisone
(200 mg per day) may be administered [20]. Prelimin￾ary results of the APROCCHSS study (NCT00625209;
involving hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone) revealed a
beneficial effect on 90-day mortality and shock reversal.
Vasopressor combinations
Depending on the efficacy/risk ratio, optimal vasopressor
therapy could thus consist of a combination of agents act￾ing on different receptors while minimizing doses of each
agent and therefore possibly increasing overall safety. This
paradigm was indirectly tested in both the VAAST and
ATHOS-3 studies [34, 53], in which norepinephrine doses
were decreased when adding vasopressin or angiotensin
II. The combination allowed a decrease in total norepin￾ephrine dose. Unfortunately, this decrease in dosage was
not associated with a decrease in adverse events.
Adrenomedullin blocking
Adrenomedullin is considered as a double-edge sword in
septic shock. On the one hand, adrenomedullin supple￾mentation improves endothelial barrier function, attenu￾ates systemic inflammation, and reverses hypodynamic
circulation and pulmonary hypertension in ovine endotox￾emia. On the other hand, high levels of adrenomedullin are
associated with short-term mortality and vasopressor re￾quirement in both septic and cardiogenic shock [77, 78].
Finally, adrenomedullin binding has been found to blunt
shock-related impairment in energy metabolism as well as
to reduce nitrosative stress and attenuate systemic inflam￾matory response, all of which were ultimately associated
with reduced kidney dysfunction and organ injury [79].
One ongoing study (NCT03085758) is currently compar￾ing two doses of ADRECIZUMAB (a humanized murine
monoclonal IgG1 antibody specifically binding the N￾terminal region of human adrenomedullin) in patients with
early septic shock and a high bio-adrenomedullin plasma
concentration.

A role for genomics and pharmacogenomics?
Pharmacogenomics could be applied to enhance efficacy
and safety of drugs used for sepsis and septic shock, in￾cluding norepinephrine, epinephrine, vasopressin, and
corticosteroids, since known genomic variants intersect
with these drugs. For example, Nakada et al. [80] dem￾onstrated that β2 adrenergic receptor gene polymorph￾ism was associated with altered responses to adrenergic
agonists and mortality in septic shock. Nevertheless, the
variant was only present in 5 to 7 % of the population,
thereby rendering the elaboration of a specific test
hazardous and likely very expensive.
Conclusions
Vasoplegia is a common feature of all advanced shock
states, with norepinephrine remaining the cornerstone
of vasoplegia-induced hypotension. However, given our
improved understanding of vasoplegia, management is
likely to evolve from a standardized therapy with nor￾epinephrine alone to a multimodal strategy with two or
more vasopressors. Based on new pathophysiological
data, numerous potential drugs are currently being in￾vestigated. Nevertheless, these new potential treatments
or therapeutic strategies should be evaluated not only
for their ability to increase arterial pressure but also for
their capacity to improve survival or decrease major
morbidity as well as for their effectiveness/cost ratio.
