Abstract
Background: Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) harbor the potential to differentiate into diverse cardiac
cell types. Previous experimental efforts were primarily directed at the generation of hiPSC-derived cells with ventricular
cardiomyocyte characteristics. Aiming at a straightforward approach for pacemaker cell modeling and replacement, we
sought to selectively differentiate cells with nodal-type properties.
Methods: hiPSC were differentiated into spontaneously beating clusters by co-culturing with visceral endoderm-like cells
in a serum-free medium. Subsequent culturing in a specified fetal bovine serum (FBS)-enriched cell medium produced a
pacemaker-type phenotype that was studied in detail using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR),
immunocytochemistry, and patch-clamp electrophysiology. Further investigations comprised pharmacological
stimulations and co-culturing with neonatal cardiomyocytes.
Results: hiPSC co-cultured in a serum-free medium with the visceral endoderm-like cell line END-2 produced
spontaneously beating clusters after 10–12 days of culture. The pacemaker-specific genes HCN4, TBX3, and TBX18 were
abundantly expressed at this early developmental stage, while levels of sarcomeric gene products remained low. We
observed that working-type cardiomyogenic differentiation can be suppressed by transfer of early clusters into a FBS￾enriched cell medium immediately after beating onset. After 6 weeks under these conditions, sinoatrial node (SAN)
hallmark genes remained at high levels, while working-type myocardial transcripts (NKX2.5, TBX5) were low. Clusters
were characterized by regular activity and robust beating rates (70–90 beats/min) and were triggered by spontaneous
Ca2+ transients recapitulating calcium clock properties of genuine pacemaker cells. They were responsive to adrenergic/
cholinergic stimulation and able to pace neonatal rat ventricular myocytes in co-culture experiments. Action potential
(AP) measurements of cells individualized from clusters exhibited nodal-type (63.4%) and atrial-type (36.6%) AP
morphologies, while ventricular AP configurations were not observed.
Conclusion: We provide a novel culture media-based, transgene-free approach for targeted generation of hiPSC-derived
pacemaker-type cells that grow in clusters and offer the potential for disease modeling, drug testing, and individualized
cell-based replacement therapy of the SAN.

Background
The technology to reprogram human somatic cells back
to pluripotency allows the production of patient-specific
human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) and holds
great translational promise [1]. In the field of cardiology,
hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes enable new approaches to
studying cellular mechanisms of inheritable diseases and
provide in vitro platforms for drug discovery and for
regenerative therapies [2].
Differentiation of hiPSC or human embryonic stem
cells (hESC) into cardiomyocytes can be achieved by
various approaches using embryoid bodies or direct
differentiation strategies [3–6], and yield a mixed popu￾lation of cells including nodal-type and working-type
(i.e., atrial and ventricular chamber) action potential
(AP) properties [7]. Most culture media-based prepara￾tions were designed to enrich ventricular-type myocytes
[8, 9], while approaches for targeted differentiation of
pacemaker-type cells from human pluripotent cells are
sparse and require sophisticated protocols [10]. How￾ever, enrichment of nodal cells in culture is an important
strategy with respect to novel approaches for the treat￾ment of bradycardias [11, 12]. Loss or dysfunction of
sinoatrial nodal cells results in sick sinus syndrome
(SSS), a collective term for disorders associated with fail￾ure in rate initiation or conduction from the sinoatrial
node (SAN) to the atrium, comprising sinus bradycardia,
SAN block, and bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome. In
many cases, symptomatic SSS requires the implantation
of an electronic pacemaker, which currently constitutes
the only effective therapy for the syndrome [13]. With
respect to limitations of electronic devices such as recur￾rent surgery due to limited battery durability, technical
failure of implanted systems, and lack of responsiveness
to the autonomic modulatory system, cell-based
biological pacemakers may overcome these drawbacks
[14, 15]. Considering the notion that cardiac differenti￾ation of pluripotent stem cells yields mixed cardiac cell
types [6, 7] and early, fetal cardiomyocytes comprise
both pacemaker- and working-type properties [7], line￾ages were suggested to share a common developmental
precursor [16–19]. Lineage separation depends on
region-specific activation of gene programs [20] to yield
either working-type myocytes that primarily develop
myogenic characteristics, or nodal-type myocytes that
express unique channel and receptor properties allowing
for spontaneous depolarization and rate modulation ac￾cording to neurohumoral demands.
We hypothesized that nodal type-specific differenti￾ation can be controlled by media-based intervention in
the dish to induce lineage specification without the
necessity of genetic manipulation. According to this
assumption, we observed that immature cardiomyogenic
hiPSC-derived colonies, generated in a serum-free
medium conditioned by visceral endoderm-like (END-2)
cells, provide early nodal-type features. Timed transfer
to a fetal bovine serum (FBS)-enriched medium drives
further development to a distinct pacemaker-type
phenotype resembling SAN-like characteristics.
Methods
Tissue procurement
All experiments involving human material were carried
out in concordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Written informed consent was obtained from all our
patients. The study protocol involving human tissue
samples for generation and differentiation of patient￾derived induced pluripotent stem cells was approved by
the ethics committee of the University of Heidelberg,
Germany (#2009-350 N-MA). hiPSC lines #1 and #2
were derived from commercially available dermal fibro￾blasts (BioCat GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany, #DF-F-ZB;
and ATCC, Teddington, UK, #CRL-2097, respectively);
#3 was derived from a healthy patient donor, as
described in Additional file 1.
All experiments involving rat and mouse tissue sam￾ples were carried out in accordance with the Guide for
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by
the US National Institute of Health (NIH publication
number 85–23, revised 1996) and the European
Community guidelines for the use of experimental animals.
Protocols were approved by the local regulatory authority
(#T-38/14 Regierungspräsidium Karlsruhe, Germany).
Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) were commercially
obtained from BioCat GmbH (#CBA-310-CB).
Generation and differentiation of hiPSC
hiPSC were generated from human fibroblast cultures
obtained from skin biopsies of healthy control probands.
Reprogramming was achieved using infection with single
lentiviral particles carrying Oct-4, Sox2, Klf4, and cMyc
(line #1). Additional hiPSC lines were generated in
different laboratories with retroviral infection and three
factors (Oct-4, Sox2, Klf4; line #2), or with a polycis￾tronic lentiviral construct encoding four pluripotency
factors (Oct-4, Sox2, Klf4, and cMyc; line #3). For details
please refer to Additional file 1. hiPSC colonies formed
teratomas and differentiated into all three germ layers
when injected into immunodeficient mice (Additional
file 2). To induce cardiomyogenic differentiation, hiPSC
were co-cultured on an END-2 cell layer (treated for 3 h
with 10 mM mitomycin C solution; Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO, USA) using knockout Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (knockout-DMEM; Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) with 100 U/ml peni￾cillin (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 100 μg/ml streptomycin
(Thermo Fisher Scientific), 100× nonessential amino acids
(Sigma-Aldrich), 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma￾Schweizer et al. Stem Cell Research & Therapy (2017) 8:229 Page 2 of 15

Aldrich), 100 μM ascorbic acid (Sigma-Aldrich), and
5 μM SB 203580 (Sigma-Aldrich), and was supplemented
with 10 μM Y-27632 dihydrochloride (Abcam, Cambridge,
UK). After 10–12 days, spontaneously beating clusters
were observed. Beating clusters were mechanically isolated
under light microscopy and transferred to standard cell
medium containing Medium 199 (Sigma-Aldrich), 10%
FBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 100 U/ml penicillin,
100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1 mM CaCl2 (Merck KGaA,
Darmstadt, Germany) and used for further culturing for
6 weeks.
Proliferation assays
Cell proliferation assays were ATP-based and performed
using the BioFix® Lumi ATP assay (Macherey-Nagel,
Düren, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol.
RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis
Total RNA of hiPSC and spontaneously beating clusters
of differentiated hiPSC cultured for 10–12 days (dhiPSC)
and 8 weeks (pacemaker cell cluster (PCC)), respectively,
were isolated using Trizol® reagent (Thermo Fisher Sci￾entific) following the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA
of the human right atrium (hRA) was purchased (BioCat
GmbH). cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription
according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Superscript II;
Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)
qRT-PCR was performed using an ABS 7500 Realtime
PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Ninety-six-well optical detec￾tion plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were loaded to a
total volume of 10 μl per well, consisting of 0.5 μl
cDNA, 5 μl TaqMan Fast Universal Master Mix
(Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 6-carboxyfluorescein
(FAM)-labeled pre-designed TaqMan probes and
primers (TaqMan Gene Expression Assays, Thermo
Fisher Scientific) (Additional file 3). In addition, pre￾designed primers and probes detecting the housekeeping
genes glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH), hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltrans￾ferase 1 (HPRT1), and beta-actin (ACTB) were applied
and normalization was carried out by a modified thresh￾old cycle (CT) relative quantification method using the
three housekeeping genes, as published elsewhere [21].
All PCR reactions were performed in triplicate and data
were expressed as an average of triplicates. To compare
relative abundance of gene expression in hiPSC, dhiPSC,
and PCC with human cardiac tissue, we analyzed relative
abundance of gene transcripts in the hRA (BioCat).
Based on previously published levels of hRA and SAN
transcripts for selected genes [22], human SAN (hSAN)
transcript levels were estimated in order to evaluate the
differentiation status of hiPSC.
Immunocytochemistry
Preparation of hiPSC
MEF were seeded on coverslips of 1.2-cm diameter
(Menzel-Gläser, Gerhard Menzel GmbH, Braunschweig,
Germany). Coverslips were previously transferred to a
24-well plate and coated with 100 μg/ml fibronectin
(Roche Applied Science, Penzberg, Germany)/phos￾phate-buffered saline (PBS; Thermo Fisher Scientific)
solution for 30 min at 37 °C. The next day, hiPSC colonies
were added and cultured in hiPSC medium (for details
please refer to Additional file 1). When they had grown
adherent, hiPSC were rinsed in PBS, fixed in 1% formalde￾hyde (Merck)/PBS for 15 min at room temperature and
stored in 0.1% formaldehyde/PBS at 4 °C.
Preparation of PCC
Eight-week-old PCC were picked, embedded in Tissue￾Tek™ (Thermo Fisher Scientific), frozen, and sliced into 5-
μm sections at –15 °C to –20 °C using a cryotome (Micro￾tome 5030; Bright Instrument Co Ltd, Huntingdon, UK)
followed by storage at –20 °C.
Preparation of dispersed pacemaker cells
PCC were enzymatically and mechanically dissociated at
week 8. In detail, PCC were washed in PBS, detached
from the dish surface using a scalpel and incubated in
1 mg/ml collagenase type IA (Sigma-Aldrich)/PBS for
30 min at 37 °C. After incubation, each PCC was trans￾ferred on a fibronectin-coated 0.5-cm diameter coverslip
(Menzel-Gläser) and covered with Medium 199. Using a
10-μl sterile micropipette tip (Eppendorf AG, Hamburg,
Germany), PCC were gently dissociated. Individual cells
were allowed to attach on the coverslip overnight before
immunocytochemistry assays were performed.
For immunocytochemistry, probes were incubated
with 0.5% TritonTM X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich)/PBS solu￾tion for 15 min, treated with 0.1 M glycine (Merck)/PBS
solution for 60 min, and incubated in blocking solution
(2% bovine serum albumin; Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for
2–3 h. Primary antibodies (Additional file 4) were di￾luted 1:200 in blocking solution and incubated at 4 °C
overnight. The next day, sections were rinsed with PBS
(3 × 2 min) and incubated with secondary antibodies
(Additional file 4) diluted 1:200 in blocking solution at
4 °C for 4 h. Cells were mounted with Citifluor glycerol/
PBS solution AF1 (Agar Scientific Ltd., Stansted, UK)
and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy using an
Olympus IX 70 fluorescence microscope with a peltier￾cooled CCD camera (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and con￾focal microscopy using a Leica TCS SP8 laser-scanning
confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar,
Schweizer et al. Stem Cell Research & Therapy (2017) 8:229 Page 3 of 15

Germany) connected to an inverted microscope (DMI￾6000) equipped with a 63× oil immersion lens (NA 1.4).
Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe
Systems Incorporated, San José, CA, USA) and ImageJ
software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD,
USA) using standard quantification methods.
Multi-electrode array recordings and pharmacological
stimulation/inhibition
To record firing rate and analyze autonomic response a
multi-electrode array (MEA) system (Multichannel Sys￾tems, Reutlingen, Germany) was used. PCC were plated
on laminin/fibronectin-coated MEAs (60MEA200/30iR￾Ti, Multichannel Systems) and cultured for 3 days to
achieve attachment to the electrodes. Electrical signals
(extracellular field potentials) were recorded in Medium
199 (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 1 mM CaCl2
media at 37 °C and sampled at 20 kHz with the MEA_R￾ack software (Multichannel Systems). Signals were ana￾lyzed using Spike2 software (v7, Cambridge Electronic
Design, Cambridge, UK). PCC underwent β-adrenergic
(1 μM isoproterenol; Sigma-Aldrich) and muscarinic
(1 μM carbachol; Sigma-Aldrich) challenge to study the
autonomic capacity to modulate firing rate (n = 6, each).
Moreover, different concentrations of ivabradine (1, 3,
50 μM; Sigma-Aldrich) were applied to assess effects of
If blockage (n = 6, each).
Co-cultures of PCC and neonatal rat ventricular myocytes
Ventricular myocytes from 1-day-old neonatal rats
(Crl:Wls River, strain code 003, coat color white, Charles
River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA, USA) were pre￾pared as previously reported [23]. Neonatal rat ventricu￾lar myocytes (NRVM) were cultured in Medium 199
supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin,
100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1 mM CaCl2. Eight-week-old
PCC were seeded on 35-mm dishes (ibidi, Martinsried,
Germany), with each dish containing a single PCC. On
the following day, 106 NRVM per dish were added to half
of the dishes for co-culture experiments, while the other
dishes comprised single PCC (n = 10, each). Electrical in￾tegration of the PCC within the monolayer was evaluated
based on synchronous contraction of the whole culture.
For control, NRVM monocultures at the same con￾centration (106 per dish, n = 10) were recorded in par￾allel. Co-cultures of PCC and NRVM as well as
NRVM monolayers (n = 10, each) were stimulated
with 1 μM isoproterenol (Sigma-Aldrich) 1 week after
culture onset, respectively, to assess responsiveness to
adrenergic stimulation and capacity to modulate the
rate. For evaluation of beating rate, dishes were kept
under 37 °C conditions and computerized beat rate
measurements were performed 15 s per microscope
section every second day or after pharmacological
application using a Fourier-analysis (program software
“Imagoquant”, Mediquant, Halle/Saale, Germany).
Recording of calcium transients
Pacemaker cell clusters (PCC) were loaded with the
Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent indicator fluo-4-AM for
10 min at 37 °C. After 10 min of de-esterification,
line-scan images were taken in spontaneously beating
cells of clusters on a confocal microscope (Olympus
FluoView1000). Fluo-4 was excited at 473 nm and
emission was collected above 500 nm. Temporal reso￾lution was 10 μs per pixel. Line-scan images were
processed using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health)
and data were analyzed in OriginPro (OriginLab,
Northampton, MA, USA).
Recording of spontaneous action potentials from
individual cells within PCC
PCC were dissociated to isolate individual cells at
week 8 as previously described (please refer to the
previous paragraph on immunocytochemistry). For
patch-clamp recordings, glass coverslips with a diam￾eter of 5 mm were coated with 0.1% gelatin and
placed into each well of a 96-well plate. Spontan￾eously beating, individual cells were used. Data were
recorded at 37 °C using the whole-cell patch-clamp
technique and action potential (AP) recordings were
obtained in the current clamp configuration [24].
Bath solution was composed of Medium 199 supple￾mented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml
streptomycin, and 1 mM CaCl2. Pipette solution con￾sisted of 145 mM KCl (Merck), 5 mM NaCl (Merck),
2 mM CaCl2, 4 mM EGTA (Merck), 2 mM MgCl2
(Merck), and 10 mM HEPES (Sigma-Aldrich). Pipettes
had resistances between 1.5 and 5 MΩ. Data were
low-pass filtered at 1 to 2 kHz (–3 dB, four-pole
Bessel filter) before digitalization at 5 to 10 kHz.
Recordings were performed using a commercially
available amplifier (Warner OC-725A, Harvard Apparatus,
Holliston, MA, USA) and pCLAMP software (Molecular
Devices, LLC, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) for data acquisition
and analysis.
Statistical analysis
All experiments and primary analyses were blinded.
Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism
(Version 6.0, Graphpad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA,
USA). Comparison between multiple groups was per￾formed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
followed by a Tukey post-hoc test. Pairwise comparison
was performed by two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test.
Differences were considered significant at the level p <
0.05. Data are presented as arithmetic mean ± standard
error of the mean (SEM).

Results
Differentiation of hiPSC colonies into PCC
Differentiation experiments were performed with three
different hiPSC lineages originating from human fibro￾blast cultures that were obtained from skin biopsies of
healthy control probands. Data originating from line #1
are depicted in the main paper; replications using lines
#2 and #3 are described in Additional file 5. hiPSC col￾onies were propagated in the undifferentiated state on
top of a MEF feeder layer. Cells grew with typical
morphology, expressed the pluripotency markers Oct-4,
Sox2, Nanog, Tra-1-60, Tra-1-81, SSEA3, and SSEA4
(Fig. 1a and b) and were able to form teratomas after
subcutaneous injection into immunodeficient mice
(Additional file 2). For cardiomyogenic differentiation,
hiPSC were co-cultured with END-2 cells [6] under
serum-free culture conditions [25]. Spontaneously beat￾ing clusters could be observed from co-culture day 10
onwards. At day 12, approximately 60% of the initial
hiPSC colonies showed regular contractions. Continued
co-culture differentiation resulted in the formation of
cardiomyogenic cell clusters that yielded predominantly
ventricular-type AP properties and were characterized
by spontaneous rates of ~ 40 beats/min [6] (Additional
file 6). In an effort to avoid working-type myogenic
differentiation, early hiPSC-derived clusters (dhiPSC)
were dissected immediately after beating onset (days 10–
12) and transferred to dishes containing a FBS (10%)-
enriched medium for continuous culturing for 8 weeks,
followed by a further culturing period for functional
characterization (4 weeks). Immunostaining and qRT￾PCR demonstrated that pluripotency markers were
downregulated upon co-culture differentiation for 10–12
days (Fig. 1b and c) and remained low throughout fur￾ther culturing in FBS-enriched medium (Fig. 1c). The
firing rate of clusters continuously increased with beat￾ing onset (Additional file 6) and stabilized at a total of
8 weeks in culture, characterized by robust and regular
rates (70–90 beats/min) (Additional file 5; please also
refer to the movie files in Additional files 7 and 8). Clus￾ters were thus designated as pacemaker cell clusters
(PCC) (Fig. 1d) and were subjected to in-depth cellular
investigation. First, we performed adenosine triphos￾phate (ATP)-based proliferation assays of native hiPSC
followed by assays throughout the differentiation and
maturation process. While proliferative activity was high
in hiPSC, differentiated cell lines showed negligible pro￾liferation (Fig. 1e).
Culture-based differentiation induces activation of a
pacemaker-related gene program
We aimed to elucidate the transcription profiles under￾lying spontaneous activity of cells treated by co-culture
differentiation for 10–12 days (dhiPSC) and after further
culturing in the presence of FBS up to week 8 (PCC).
Transcript levels were compared to native, non-beating
hiPSC. Gene transcription in a pool of commercially
available human right atrial samples served as a refer￾ence. As hSAN tissue was not available, hSAN transcript
levels were calculated based on previously published
data [22] and utilized to evaluate the differentiation
status of cell clusters.
Pacemaker-specific transcription factors
T-box transcription factors 3 (Tbx3) and 18 (Tbx18)
contribute importantly to the development of pacemaker
sites by suppression of ventricular cardiomyocyte differ￾entiation, activation of nodal-specific genetic pathways
[1], and initiation of SAN formation [26], respectively.
Transcripts of both Tbx3 and Tbx18 were virtually
absent in hiPSC (Fig. 2a and b) but increased signifi￾cantly upon differentiation (1146-fold for Tbx3, p <
0.001; 582-fold for Tbx18, p < 0.001) and remained high
throughout further culturing in FBS-enriched medium.
Compared to transcription in the hRA, levels were
markedly higher (five-fold for Tbx3, p < 0.001) or similar
(for Tbx18, p = 0.36; Fig. 2a and b). Furthermore, we an￾alyzed the transcription factor SHOX2 and its target
Bmp4, involved in pacemaker cell development [27].
SHOX2 was significantly upregulated by culturing in the
FBS-enriched medium (15-fold, p < 0.001), although
absolute gene expression remained lower than in the
atrium (four-fold, p < 0.001; Fig. 2c). Bmp4 transcripts
were barely detectable in hiPSC, but increased markedly
leading to levels in early dhiPSC clusters and in PCC
that exceeded the levels in the human right atrium (two￾fold, p < 0.001, for both; Fig. 2d).
Myocardial transcription factors and marker genes
Transcription factors Tbx5, Nkx2.5, and Mef2c are in￾volved in differentiation and structural maturation of
ventricular cardiomyocytes [28]. While Tbx5 and
Nkx2.5 both promote ventricular development [29],
overexpression of Nkx2.5 represses SAN development
[30], indicating a reverse role in nodal-type cell differ￾entiation. In native hiPSC colonies, transcripts of
Tbx5, Nkx2.5, and Mef2c were not detected but
abundant transcription was observed after co-culture
differentiation (2255-fold increase for Tbx5, p < 0.001;
4580-fold increase for Nkx2.5, p < 0.001; 958-fold in￾crease for Mef2c, p < 0.001; Fig. 2e–g). Gene tran￾scription of these working-type myocardial markers
was significantly downregulated after further culturing
in FBS-enriched medium (two-fold decrease for Tbx5,
p < 0.001; five-fold decrease for Nkx2.5, p < 0.001;
two-fold decrease for Mef2c, p < 0.001; Fig. 2e–g). In
line with this, cardiac troponin I (cTnI) levels were
absent from hiPSC and were low after co-culture and

FBS-enriched culturing (Fig. 2h), indicating a lack of
working-type myocardial differentiation.
Ion channels and transporters
Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide channels
(HCN) (Fig. 3a–c) produce the pacemaker current (If)
that is importantly involved in SAN pacemaker activity
[31, 32] and early embryonic heart development [17, 33].
Hardly detectable in hiPSC, transcripts of nodal-specific
HCN isoforms 1 and 4 [34] were significantly upregu￾lated upon hiPSC co-culture differentiation (329-fold for
HCN1, p < 0.001; 129-fold for HCN4, p < 0.001),

reaching levels similar or higher compared to the
hSAN. High levels of transcription were maintained
in PCC (p = 0.89 for HCN1; p = 0.87 for HCN4; Fig. 3a
and c). The sodium calcium exchanger 1 (NCX1),
crucial for SAN function [35], was significantly upreg￾ulated upon co-culture differentiation (1981-fold, p <
0.001) and reached transcription levels in PCC that
even exceeded hSAN levels (Fig. 3d). Transcript levels
of L-type calcium channel subunits Cav1.2 and Cav1.3
and the T-type subunit Cav3.1 were almost absent
from hiPSC, but increased markedly throughout
co-culture differentiation (540-fold for Cav1.2, p <
0.001; 368-fold for Cav1.3, p < 0.001; 369-fold for
Cav3.1, p < 0.001) and showed levels similar or higher
than in the atrium/hSAN after culturing in FBS￾enriched medium (Fig. 3e–g). Nav1.5, underlying the
main depolarizing cardiac sodium current in working￾type myocytes [36], showed transcript levels in PCC
significantly lower than in the atrium (five-fold, p <
0.001; Fig. 3h). Transcripts of K channel genes encod￾ing the inward rectifier subunit Kir2.1, hERG, and the
Kv4.3 subunit were not detected in hiPSC and
remained low upon differentiation (Fig. 3i–k).
Connexins (Cx)
Spatial connexin expression contributes essentially to
the electrophysiological properties of specified cardiac
structures [37]. While Cx45 is characteristic for the SAN
and the conduction system [38], Cx40 and Cx43 sub￾units represent components of the working myocardium
[37, 38]. hiPSC displayed high transcript levels of Cx43,
and low levels of Cx40 and Cx45 (Fig. 3l–n). Further dif￾ferentiation in FBS-enriched medium resulted in marked
downregulation of Cx43 (four-fold, p < 0.001), while
Cx40 levels remained low (p = 0.11) and Cx45 levels
were significantly increased (four-fold, p < 0.001)
(Fig. 3l–n).
Adrenergic receptors
Adrenergic receptors are critical for modulation of rate
response in the SAN [39]. Relevant transcripts of adren￾ergic receptors were not detected in hiPSC (Fig. 3o–q).
Upon differentiation, α1a- and β1-adrenoceptor tran￾scripts remained low during co-culturing, but were
markedly increased throughout further culturing in FBS￾enriched medium (12-fold for α1a-adrenoceptor, p <
0.001; 295-fold for β1-adrenoceptor, p < 0.001; Fig. 3o
and p). β2-adrenoceptors were upregulated during
co-culture, reaching levels similar to the human right
atrium (p = 0.87) or hSAN, while expression further in￾creased under the influence of FBS up to week 8 (two￾fold, p = 0.02) (Fig. 3q).
Membrane expression of pacemaker-related ion channels
and connexins
While hiPSC colonies are characterized by minor mem￾brane expression of pacemaker-related ion channels and
connexins, immunocytochemical analysis of cells dis￾persed from PCC revealed marked membrane signals of
HCN1, HCN4, NCX, Cav1.2, and Cx45 (Fig. 4).

Moreover, extensive nuclear signal of the nodal￾specific transcription factor SHOX2 could be ob￾served, further substantiating the nodal phenotype. In
contrast, low signals for cTnI and negligible mem￾brane expression of Cx43 and Nav1.5 (Fig. 4b), which
represent typical marker proteins of working-type car￾diomyocytes, confirmed the specificity of pacemaker￾type cells. This is underlined by immunohistochemical
analysis of PCC using “whole mount” cryosections
(Additional file 9).

Functional and pharmacological characteristics of PCC
hiPSC-derived pacemaker cell clusters (PCC) cultured
over a period of 8 weeks according to our protocol
(Fig. 1d) exhibited regular contractions and constant
rates (Fig. 5a–f; see Additional files 7 and 8 for movies),
which remained stable throughout a subsequent obser￾vational period of 28 days (Additional file 5). SAN pace￾maker cells change firing rates according to autonomic
input. To assess adrenergic and cholinergic rate
response, PCC were plated on MEAs to record extracel￾lular field potentials (Fig. 5a). Beta-adrenergic stimula￾tion (1 μM isoproterenol) increased the firing rates of
PCC from 78.9 ± 4.2 beats/min to 129.8 ± 8.9 beats/min
(n = 6; p < 0.001; Fig. 5b and c). Subsequent exposure to
carbachol (1 μM) decreased the rate to 42.2 ± 5.1 beats/
min (n = 6; p < 0.001; Fig. 5b and c). Treatment of PCC
with ivabradine at a dosage that specifically inhibits the
f-current [40] elicited significant decline in the beating
rate (Δ rate of –22.5 ± 2.3 beats/min using 3 μM ivabra￾dine; n = 6; p < 0.001; Fig. 5d and e).
PCC pace neonatal rat ventricular myocytes in co-culture
experiments
When co-cultured with neonatal rat ventricular
myocytes (NRVM), PCC initiated a constant and syn￾chronized beating of co-cultures (79.9 ± 2.8 beats/min;
n = 10) similar to that of monocultured PCC (Fig. 5f )
that was maintained during follow-up for 28 days.
Notably, neonatal myocyte monolayers showed signifi￾cantly slower beating rates (66.7 ± 2.1 beats/min; n =
10; p < 0.01; Fig. 5g), which declined after culturing
for 2 weeks to rates < 40 beats/min. Furthermore, rate
response after stimulation with isoproterenol (1 μM)
was significantly higher in co-culture of PCC with
neonatal myocytes compared to neonatal myocyte
monolayers (Fig. 5g).
PCC elicit spontaneous Ca2+ transients
While membrane channels importantly contribute to
pacemaking, SAN cells are also triggered by the finely
orchestrated interplay of ion channels with intracellular
Ca2+ cycling leading to spontaneous Ca2+ transients.
Confocal line-scan images of changes in [Ca2+]i in fluo￾4-AM loaded PCC demonstrated regular repetitive oscil￾lations in [Ca2+]i indicating spontaneous Ca2+ transients
(Fig. 6). This suggests a “coupled clock” mechanism that
drives automaticity in pacemaker-type cells.
Morphological features and action potential properties of
cells isolated from PCC
We next assessed morphological and electrophysio￾logical features of cells isolated from PCC. Native SAN
pacemaker cells have a specific appearance, character￾ized by an elongated, spindle-shaped morphology and

specific membrane signal (Cx43, Nav1.5). Nuclei are counterstained with

pronounced membrane expression of HCN4, which
serves as marker protein of the SAN [41]. Cells isolated
from the center of PCC (Fig. 7a) resembled native SAN
cells with respect to their elongated shape and abundant
membrane expression of HCN4 (Fig. 7b). To analyze
electrophysiological properties, spontaneous APs were
recorded from individual cells dissociated from PCC
(Fig. 7a). We sought to characterize cell subtypes by de￾termining rate interval, maximum diastolic potential
(MDP), peak voltage, amplitude (Amp), maximal rate of
depolarization (dV/dtmax), AP duration (APD) at differ￾ent levels of repolarization (APD measured at 10% incre￾ments of Amp), and APD30–40/APD70–80 ratio (with
ratios > 1.5 indicating ventricular-type APs) [42]
(Table 1). Based on these criteria, 21 of 41 cells displayed
APs resembling typical nodal-type characteristics of cen￾tral SAN myocytes (Fig. 7c). Parameters comprised short
beat rate interval, low AP amplitudes, a maximal dia￾stolic potential that was less negative than in working￾type cardiomyocytes, and an APD30–40/APD70–80 ratio of
1.0 ± 0.1, consistent with AP morphology without a plat￾eau phase (Fig. 7c, Table 1). Fifteen of 41 cells showed
AP properties attributed by longer beating rate interval
and AP amplitude, a maximal diastolic potential that
was more negative than in central SAN myocytes, and a
shorter AP duration with faster maximal rate of
depolarization typical for atrial-type APs (Fig. 7d,
Table 1). Furthermore, 5 of 41 cells showed AP

configurations between central SAN- and atrial-type pre￾viously designated as peripheral SAN-type APs (Fig. 7e,
Table 1) [43]. Interestingly, pacemaker-type cells within
the PCC appeared structurally organized. Central SAN￾type AP morphology was primarily shown by cells local￾ized at the center of a cluster, while peripheral cells were
characterized by atrial- or peripheral SAN-type APs
(Fig. 7a–e).
Discussion
The generation of biological pacemaker activity may
offer a promising avenue to overcome the limitations of
electronic pacemaker devices. To date, scientific ap￾proaches essentially comprise two strategies: 1) the use
of cell replacement therapy to substitute loss of active
pacemaker cells; and/or 2) viral transfection with genes
that either transform myocytes into virtual pacemaker

cells or elicit currents that produce spontaneous excita￾tion of previously quiescent cells [10, 14, 15, 41, 44–46].
Concerns remain with respect to hazards such as im￾mune rejection, tumor genesis, arrhythmogenicity, or
only transient effects of pacemaker function [14, 15, 47].
Moreover, insufficient beating rates and lack of complete
differentiation/integration of generated, electrically ac￾tive cells into pacemaker sites constitute challenges that
need to be overcome when seeking clinical translation.
The ability of hiPSC to differentiate into various types of
cardiac cells that could be retransplanted into an adult
patient in an autologous setting renders them an attract￾ive cell source [7]. However, limitations include the pro￾duction of mixed and immature cardiac cells [48]. To
achieve a nodal-type specification, previous approaches
used viral gene transduction of the pacemaker-related
genes HCN4, SHOX2, or TBX18 [41, 49, 50], leading to
the risk of systemic infection and/or only transient ef￾fects of gene therapy.
We here report on the subtype-specific generation
of cardiac pacemaker-type cells from hiPSC using a
culture media-based approach. After 10–12 days of
co-culture with END-2 cells [6] in serum-free
medium, differentiated hiPSC lines (dhiPSC) formed
beating clusters (~50 beats/min) and exhibited the
abundant transcription of pacemaker hallmark genes.
Action potential (AP) morphology at this early stage
showed features highly similar to nodal-type APs, but
slow rates and low amplitude indicated an immature
nature to these cells (Additional files 10 and 11). Cor￾respondingly, clusters expressed the working-type
myocardial transcription factors Tbx5, Mef2c, and
Nkx2.5, in addition to pacemaker-related genes, in
line with a premature precursor cell type sharing
nodal- and working-type cardiomyocyte properties
[16–19]. Based on previous reports indicating that
FBS increases the automaticity of pluripotent cell￾derived cardiomyocytes [51], we evaluated whether
timed transfer of dhiPSC from serum-free co-culture
medium to a FBS-enriched medium immediately after
beating onset may promote differentiation towards
the nodal-type direction.
Clusters, cultured for 8 weeks according to our proto￾col, expressed high levels of pacemaker-related tran￾scripts and proteins, in particular transcription factors
(Tbx3, Tbx18, SHOX2), transporters (NCX1), connexins
(Cx45), ion channels (HCN1, HCN4, Cav1.2), and adren￾ergic receptors. At the same time, transcription factors
(Tbx5, Mef2c, Nkx2.5), structural markers (cTnI, Cx40),
and ion channels (Nav1.5, Kv4.3, Kir2.1) related to
working-type cardiomyocytes were downregulated.
Nodal-type lineage specification was essentially indicated
by an inverse relation of increasing firing rate and
declining transcript levels of Nkx2.5 after exposure to
FBS-enriched medium (Additional file 6A and C). In
contrast, continued co-culturing in serum-free medium
in a parallel culture resulted in robust Nkx2.5 levels and
slowly declining rates (Additional file 6B and D), reflect￾ing differentiation towards a primarily ventricular
phenotype [6, 9]. Importantly, Nkx2.5 is a major regula￾tor for sinus node development and nodal subtype
specification. High Nkx2.5 transcription promotes differ￾entiation into working-type cardiomyocytes [29], repres￾sing SAN development [30]. Conversely, decline of
Nkx2.5 is a prerequisite for activation of the pacemaker
gene program [30]. Thus, downregulation of Nkx2.5
after a switch to the serum-enriched medium is
considered as key to lineage specification in the
pacemaker-type direction. This is underlined by the fact
that culturing in serum-enriched medium leads to upregu￾lation of SHOX2 (Fig. 2c), a transcription factor known to
antagonize the transcriptional output of Nkx2.5 [52].
Moreover, the role of Nkx2.5 is further supported by a re￾cent study demonstrating that pacemaker-type cells are
recruited from Nkx2.5-negative progenitors [10].
Patch-clamp recordings revealed that a majority of
cells (63.4%) isolated from PCC produced nodal-type
APs. Interestingly, we observed a specified cellular
arrangement within the clusters. While cells at the cen￾ter formed elongated, spindle-shaped morphologies and
exhibited spontaneous central SAN-type AP properties,
more peripheral cells produced APs with a higher
upstroke resembling atrial or peripheral SAN cells [43].
Of note, APs with plateau morphology, pointing to

ventricular-type cardiomyocytes, were not observed.
Furthermore, cells within PCC produce spontaneous Ca2+
transients characterized by regular repetitive oscillations
in [Ca2+]i pointing to a “coupled clock” mechanism that
drives automaticity in pacemaker-type cells. To rule out
the persistence of immature cells with retained prolif￾erative activity and bearing a risk of tumorigenesis,
we performed ATP-based proliferation assays prior
and throughout differentiation. While proliferative ac￾tivity was high in hiPSC, we found negligible prolifer￾ation of dhiPSC when cultured in the FBS-enriched
medium for weeks.
Altogether, we reasoned that switching medium and
subsequent long-term culture in the presence of FBS
elicits subtype specification from immature cardiomyo￾genic precursors to progressively maturated nodal-type
cells. This notion was further substantiated by functional
assessment of PCC using MEA. Automaticity of PCC
was rate responsive to adrenergic and cholinergic stimu￾lation, indicating the capacity of clusters to modulate the
rate according to autonomic input. In addition, treat￾ment with ivabradine at a concentration that specifically
inhibits the f-current (3 μM) [40] significantly reduced
the beating rate, indicating a rate modulation facilitated
by f-current, similar to the physiological situation in the
SAN. In this regard, it was recently reported that ivabra￾dine at relatively high concentrations of up to 9 μM did
not alter the rate of spontaneously beating hiPSC￾derived working-type cardiomyocytes [53], pointing to
different mechanisms of automaticity in such cells.
Baseline rates of PCC were regular and robust (70–90
beats/min) and persisted throughout long-term culture.
Co-culture with NRVM indicated electrical integration of
the PCC within the monolayer based on synchronous con￾traction of the whole culture at PCC baseline rates, which
were significantly faster than NRVM monocultures.
To date, knowledge about medium-based lineage spe￾cification of pluripotent stem cells toward the nodal
subtype is limited, and most data were produced in
mouse embryonic stem cell lines (Additional file 12).
Notably, these approaches beside the hanging drop
method and diverse enrichment strategies usually apply
a considerable amount of FBS (10–20%) as an integral
component to achieve differentiation of attached cells.
To investigate the subtype specification of SAN-like cells
during differentiation, comparative expression analysis
of SAN-specific marker genes SHOX2 and HCN4 have
been established for positive control in these studies
[52], according to our approach.
Future studies need to further explore the molecular
mechanisms underlying co-culture- and serum-dependent
cardiac lineage specification of human pluripotent cell
lines. Moreover, the capability of PCC to induce in vivo
biological pacemaker function needs to be investigated. In
an experimental large animal model, however, such an
approach may necessitate immunosuppression to enable
transplantation of human-derived cells [19, 54] into an
animal heart.
Conclusion
We provide an efficient approach to differentiate stem
cell-derived pacemaker-type cells that develop in clusters
and possess the characteristic properties of nodal-type car￾diomyocytes. Different from most previous strategies [55],
our approach is based on human cells and does not re￾quire genetic manipulation to achieve pacemaker cell dif￾ferentiation. Phenotypic features include not only
electrical oscillation but also electrophysiological, cellular,
and morphological properties of endogenous pacemaker
cells. Our technology thus may facilitate in vitro studies of
cellular mechanisms of sinus node disease using patient￾specific iPSC and provides a platform for drug testing and
for the generation of a biological pacemaker.
