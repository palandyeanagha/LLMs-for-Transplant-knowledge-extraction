Fabry disease
Dominique P Germain1,2
Abstract
Fabry disease (FD) is a progressive, X-linked inherited disorder of glycosphingolipid metabolism due to deficient or
absent lysosomal a-galactosidase A activity. FD is pan-ethnic and the reported annual incidence of 1 in 100,000 may
underestimate the true prevalence of the disease. Classically affected hemizygous males, with no residual a-galactosi￾dase A activity may display all the characteristic neurological (pain), cutaneous (angiokeratoma), renal (proteinuria, kid￾ney failure), cardiovascular (cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia), cochleo-vestibular and cerebrovascular (transient ischemic
attacks, strokes) signs of the disease while heterozygous females have symptoms ranging from very mild to severe.
Deficient activity of lysosomal a-galactosidase A results in progressive accumulation of globotriaosylceramide within
lysosomes, believed to trigger a cascade of cellular events. Demonstration of marked a-galactosidase A deficiency is the
definitive method for the diagnosis of hemizygous males. Enzyme analysis may occasionnally help to detect heterozy￾gotes but is often inconclusive due to random X-chromosomal inactivation so that molecular testing (genotyping) of
females is mandatory. In childhood, other possible causes of pain such as rheumatoid arthritis and ‘growing pains’ must
be ruled out. In adulthood, multiple sclerosis is sometimes considered. Prenatal diagnosis, available by determination of
enzyme activity or DNA testing in chorionic villi or cultured amniotic cells is, for ethical reasons, only considered in male
fetuses. Pre-implantation diagnosis is possible. The existence of atypical variants and the availability of a specific therapy
singularly complicate genetic counseling. A disease-specific therapeutic option - enzyme replacement therapy using
recombinant human a-galactosidase A - has been recently introduced and its long term outcome is currently still being
investigated. Conventional management consists of pain relief with analgesic drugs, nephroprotection (angiotensin
converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptors blockers) and antiarrhythmic agents, whereas dialysis or renal
transplantation are available for patients experiencing end-stage renal failure. With age, progressive damage to vital
organ systems develops and at some point, organs may start to fail in functioning. End-stage renal disease and life￾threatening cardiovascular or cerebrovascular complications limit life-expectancy of untreated males and females with
reductions of 20 and 10 years, respectively, as compared to the general population. While there is increasing evidence
that long-term enzyme therapy can halt disease progression, the importance of adjunctive therapies should be empha￾sized and the possibility of developing an oral therapy drives research forward into active site specific chaperones.

II - Definition
Fabry disease (FD, OMIM 301500) [1,2] is a devastating,
progressive inborn error of metabolism with, particularly
in the early stages, important roles being played by cel￾lular dysfunction and microvascular pathology induced
by lysosomal glycosphingolipid deposition [3]. Absent or
deficient activity of lysosomal exoglycohydrolase a￾galactosidase A (a-D-galactoside galactohydrolase, EC
3.2.1.22; a-gal A) [4,5] results in progressive accumula￾tion of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3 or GL-3; also known
as ceramidetrihexoside or CTH) and related glycosphin￾golipids (galabiosylceramide) within lysosomes which are
ubiquitous subcellular organelles [6], in a variety of cell
types, including capillary endothelial cells, renal (podo￾cytes, tubular cells, glomerular endothelial, mesangial

and intersticial cells), cardiac (cardiomyocytes and fibro￾blasts) and nerve cells [7]. The primary disease process
starts in infancy, or even as early as in the fetal stage of
development [8,9]. However, in contrast to many other
lysosomal storage diseases [10,11], most patients remain
clinically asymptomatic during the very first years of life.
In FD, lysosomal storage and cellular dysfunction are
believed to trigger a cascade of events including cellular
death, compromised energy metabolism [12-14], small
vessel injury [15], K(Ca)3.1 channel dysfunction in
endothelial cells [16], oxidative stress [17], impaired
autophagosome maturation [18], tissue ischemia and,
importantly, development of irreversible cardiac [19-21]
and renal [22] tissue fibrosis. The first clinical symptoms
interfering with the child’s well-being and performance
arise in childhood, typically between the ages of 3 and
10 years, and generally a few years later in girls than in
boys [23,24]. With age, progressive damage to vital
organ systems develops in both genders [24] leading to
organ failure. End-stage renal disease and life-threaten￾ing cardiovascular or cerebrovascular complications
limit life-expectancy [25-27].
FD has long been regarded as an adult disease with
most, if not all, affected males developing a “classic”
phenotype. Later on, the sub-classifications “cardiac var￾iant” [28,29] and “renal variant” [30] were introduced
for patients with predominant or exclusive cardiac or
renal involvement, respectively. Female heterozygotes
were erroneously described as “carriers of the defective
gene” more or less safeguarded against developing dis￾ease manifestations and symptoms. However, evolving
knowledge about the natural course of disease suggests
that it is more appropriate to describe FD as a disease
with a wide spectrum of heterogeneously progressive
clinical phenotypes. This spectrum ranges from the
“classic” severe phenotype in males to a seemingly
asymptomatic disease course occasionally observed in
females, with a variety of clinical presentations inbetw￾een. Indeed, most female heterozygotes develop symp￾toms due to yet undetermined mechanisms [24,31,32]
and a high percentage of females develop vital organ
involvement including the kidneys, heart and/or brain
about a decade later than males [24].
III - Epidemiology
FD belongs to a group of at least 50 genetically distinct,
biochemically related lysosomal storage disorders. Each
disorder is caused by an inborn error of metabolism due
to a monogenetic defect specifically resulting in the defi￾ciency of lysosomal enzyme(s). FD is pan-ethnic, but
due to its rarity, determining an accurate disease fre￾quency is difficult. Reported incidences, ranging from 1
in 476,000 [33] to 1 in 117,000 [34] in the general popu￾lation, may largely underestimate the true prevalence
(Table 1). Newborn screening initiatives have found an
unexpectedly high prevalence of the disease, as high as 1
in ~3,100 newborns in Italy [35] and have identified a
surprisingly high frequency of newborn males with FD
(approximately 1 in 1,500) in Taiwan, 86% having the

found in later-onset cardiac phenotype patients [36]

IV - Clinical description
A. Early signs and symptoms: Fabry disease at the pediatric
age
Early neural damage primarily involves small nerve
fibers of the peripheral somatic [38] and autonomic
nerve systems [39] with onset of related symptoms gen￾erally occurring at an earlier age in boys than in girls
[23,40-42]. Pain is experienced by 60-80% of classically
affected boys and girls [23,43] and is one of the earliest
symptoms of FD. Two types of pain have been
described: episodic crises ("Fabry crises”) characterized
by agonizing burning pain originating in the extremities
and radiating inwards to the limbs and other parts of
the body, and chronic pain characterized by burning
and tingling paraesthesias [44]. Fabry crises may be pre￾cipitated by fever, exercise, fatigue, stress, and rapid
changes in temperature [45]. When the crises are trig￾gered or accompanied by fever, patients usually also
have an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. As a
result of their pain, patients with FD have a greatly
diminished quality of life [46,47]. Other possible causes
of pain that must be ruled out are rheumatoid arthritis,
rheumatic fever, Raynaud’s disease, systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE) and ‘growing pains’ (a frequent
misdiagnosis in children with FD) (Table 2). Pain may
wane in adulthood and it is important to search for a
medical history of acroparesthesia in childhood during
the first examination of a newly diagnosed adult patient
[48].
Other early-onset signs appearing in childhood will
usually remain present during adulthood and, among
them, gastrointestinal involvement is a common, but
under-appreciated, manifestation of FD [49]. Patients
may complain of abdominal pain (often after eating),
diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting, which are a significant
cause of anorexia [50]. These gastrointestinal symptoms
may be related to the deposition of Gb3 in the auto￾nomic ganglia of the bowel and mesenteric blood vessels
[51]. Diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome
(IBS) is a differential diagnosis [50].
Absence of sweating (anhidrosis) [52] or a decreased
ability to sweat (hypohidrosis) [53] with decreased skin
impedance [54] is a significant problem for patients and
can cause heat [55] and exercise intolerance [51,56].
The most visible early clinical feature of FD is angio￾keratoma (skin lesions) and clusters of small reddish
purple, raised skin lesions (Figure 1) are typically found
on the buttocks, groin, umbilicus and upper thighs, but
also sometimes on mucosal areas, such as the mouth.
Histologically, the skin lesions are small superficial
angiomas caused by cumulative damage of the vascular
endothelial cells of the skin with vessel dilatation in the
dermis (Figure 2) that increase in number and size with
age and can occur singly or in groups [53,56,57]. Telan￾giectasia [53,55] and subcutaneous edema [58] have also
been reported.
Corneal changes (”cornea verticillata“), rarely of visual
significance and readily detectable by slit lamp examina￾tion, are frequently encountered. Retinal vessel tortuos￾ity may be observed.
Tinnitus may be an early symptom and hearing loss
has been reported in children [59].
Chronic fatigue and difficulty gaining weight may also
frequently occur, particularly during adolescence. High￾flow priapism can also be observed in young boys
affected with FD.
Despite the absence of major organ dysfunction, these
symptoms, individually or in combination, may cause
significant morbidity limiting the child’s physical, school
and social performances [60]. Early signs and symptoms
of FD are presented in Table 2.
Early signs of cardiac and cerebrovascular abnormal￾ities may be present during adolescence in both genders.
Signs of involvement of the sinus node and conduction
system (e.g. shortened PR interval, arrhythmias,
impaired heart rate variability, and mild valvular insuffi￾ciency) have been demonstrated [61]. Although rare, evi￾dence of microvascular ischemic brain involvement on
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be detectable at
young ages [62].

The natural course of Fabry nephropathy in children
or adolescent patients is still largely not understood.
Signs indicative of early, insidiously progressing renal
damage include microalbuminuria and proteinuria
developing as early as in the second decade of life
[63-65]. Histologic, potentially irreversible changes to
glomeruli, interstitial tubules and vascular structures
before the first appearance of microalbuminuria can be
observed in renal biopsy specimens from children [65].
Podocyte foot process effacement has been reported and
indicates focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. A decline
in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is uncommon at
pediatric ages but may be seen as early as adolescence
[56,66]. Studies on renal function in children with FD
have mainly been done using estimated creatinine-based
GFR. The widely used original Schwartz formula [67]
substantially overestimates GFR with a low accuracy,
whereas the new abbreviated Schwartz formula [68]
shows relatively good performances with a mean GFR
overestimation of 5.3 ml/min/1.73 m2
, being only
slightly superior to the Counahan-Barratt formula [69].
The new abbreviated Schwartz formula should replace
the original Schwartz formula in the routine follow-up
of children with FD [70]. The current creatinine-based
GFR formulas are all hampered by low accuracy in the
“creatinine-blind” GFR range. Supplemental measured
GFR is, therefore, recommended in patients where
changes in GFR have potential impact on important
treatment regimens [70].
B. Kidney involvement
Like most aspects of the disease, renal pathology
increases in severity with age. In classically affected
Fabry patients, renal lesions result from Gb3 deposition
in the glomerular endothelial, mesangial, intersticial
cells and in podocytes (Figures 3 and 4), which are
terminally-differenciated epithelial cells that accumulate
numerous myelin-like inclusions in their lysosomes (Fig￾ure 5). Podocyte foot process effacement has been
described. Glycosphingolipid storage also occur in the
epithelium of the loop of Henle and the distal tubules
(Figure 6), and in the endothelial and smooth muscle
cells of the renal arterioles (Figure 7) [63,71].
Renal impairment often begins with microalbuminuria
and proteinuria in the 2nd to 3rd decade of life which,
like in diabetic nephropathy, are believed to directly
contribute to the progression of the Fabry nephropathy.

or in clusters. They are typically found on the lower back (A), buttocks (C), groin, flanks (D) and upper thighs but their distribution may be
restricted to a limited area, such as the umbilicus (B).

With advancing age, proteinuria worsens [72]. Isosthe￾nuria accompanied by alterations in tubular reabsorp￾tion, secretion and excretion develop. Initially,
glomerular compensation (hyperfiltration) may mask
impairment of renal function but, once a critical number
of nephrons have been damaged, renal function will pro￾gressively decline. Gradual deterioration of renal
function and development of azotemia usually occur in
the third to fifth decades of life [73]. At this stage, fibro￾sis, sclerosis, and tubular atrophy dominate the disease
activity portending end-stage renal disease that generally
occurs in males in the 4th to 5th decade of life [25,74].
The nephrological aspects of FD are major contributors
to the morbidity and mortality associated with the disor￾der. Progression to end-stage renal failure is the primary
cause of death in male patients with untreated FD and
death most often results from uremia, unless chronic
hemodialysis or renal transplantation is undertaken [25].
The evaluations of kidney function that should be car￾ried out in every patient include serum creatinin, cysta￾tin C, estimates of GFR, total protein, (micro) albumin
excretion and urinary sodium excretion. In early stages
of kidney involvement, quantitative estimates of GFR are
necessary [75]. The utility of “spot” urine protein/creati￾nine ratios and estimated GFR with the modification of
diet with renal disease (MDRD) equation has been
established. Assessment of proteinuria and GFR can be
used for the staging of chronic kidney disease (CKD), as
described in the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality
Initiative (K/DOQI CKD) guidelines [51]. Kidney biop￾sies may be useful as a baseline assessment and in
patients with atypical presentations, including a repeat
kidney biopsy when the disease is progressing despite
therapy [71].
Urinary protein excretion is strongly associated with
renal disease progression in men and women with Fabry
disease [76,77].
C. Cardiac involvement
Cardiac symptoms including left ventricular hypertro￾phy, arrhythmia, angina and dyspnea are reported in
approximately 40-60% of patients with FD [25,78-81].
Arrhythmias and impaired heart rate variability arise
from involvement of the sinus node, conduction system
and imbalance between sympathetic and parasympa￾thetic tone. Diastolic dysfunction and concentric left
ventricular hypertrophy, which is typically non-obstruc￾tive, are important features, with men generally more
severely affected than women. Myocardial ischemia and
infarction may result from compromised function of the
coronary vascular bed [82]. With age, progressive myo￾cardial fibrosis develops with both intersticial and repla￾cement fibrosis [21,83]. Replacement fibrosis almost
always starts in the posterior-lateral wall and in the
mid-myocardium. In end-stage patients, transmural
replacement fibrosis gradually reduces cardiac function
to the stage of congestive heart failure [19,84-86]. Malig￾nant arrhythmias are responsible for a number of car￾diac deaths in patients affected with FD [81,86,87].
Left ventricular structural changes Left ventricular (LV)
structural abnormalities are frequent in patients with FD
and can be demonstrated using echocardiography

(Figures 8 and 9) or cardiac MRI (Figure 10) [19,78-80].
It is particularly important to measure the septum thick￾ness since the posterior wall may become thinner with
age due to replacement fibrosis. Concentric hypertrophy
has been reported as the most common structural change
[78]. Despite these structural changes, however, systolic
function appears to be largely preserved when assessed
with conventional measurements [19,78-80,84,88]. The
cardiomyopathy of FD is characterized by reduced myo￾cardial contraction and relaxation tissue doppler velocities
(Figures 11 and 12), sometimes detectable even before
development of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Tis￾sue Doppler Imaging (TDI) can provide a preclinical
diagnosis of Fabry cardiomyopathy [89,90] and myocar￾dial function can be quantified by ultrasonic strain rate
imaging to assess radial and longitudinal myocardial
deformation (Figures 11 and 12) [91].
Right ventricular structural changes Right ventricular
hypertrophy (RVH) with normal chamber size and pre￾served systolic but impaired diastolic function represents
the typical right ventricular (RV) structural change in
FD. When a detailed echocardiographic examination
was performed in 58 patients with FD (mean age 40 ±
16 years), RVH was present in 40% of affected subjects
with similar prevalence in both genders [92]. Two thirds
of patients with LVH also exhibited RVH. RV dilatation
was not present in any subject. RV diastolic dysfunction
was present in 47% of 45 subjects in whom RV filling
was assessed. RV diastolic dysfunction was associated
with the presence of RVH. A significant correlation
between RV wall thickness and age and left ventricular

mass index was noted [92]. In another study, the degree
of right ventricular involvement in FD was also related
to the left ventricular cardiomyopathy stage [93]. RV
involvement is common in FD and ultimately progresses
to severe diastolic RV dysfunction. These findings might
explain why patients with preserved left ventricule (LV)
function can develop clinical features such as reduced
exercise capacity, organomegaly and lymphoedema [94].
Electrocardiographic abnormalities Electrocardio￾graphic (ECG) changes in patients with FD are frequent

and include voltage criteria and repolarization changes
related to LVH and/or remodeling, ST segment depres￾sion and T-wave inversions [95]. Other abnormalities
include a short PR interval (< 0.12 msec) [96] due to a
short P wave, enlarged QRS complex and prolonged
QTC intervals, intermittent supraventricular tachycardia
[97], AV node blocks [98], bundle branch blocks [99]
and arrhythmias (Figure 13) [19,78-81]. 24-hour-ECG

(ERT) (Figure 14). The cardiac manifestations observed
in patients with classic FD are also observed in patients
with the cardiac variant of FD [28,100].
Valvular involvement Although previous work reported
a high prevalence of mitral valve prolapse in Fabry
patients [101], this finding was not confirmed by recent
studies [80,102].
Coronary involvement The myocardial perfusion
reserve was found to be significantly reduced in patients
affected with FD [103]. Patients with FD have abnormal
coronary microvascular function [82].
Exercise capacity Exercise capacity is reduced in
patients with FD compared with that predicted from
normative population data [104,105].
Autonomic dysfunction Fabry patients have autonomic
dysfunction but usually do not present clinically overt
signs of orthostatic dysregulation [106].
Aortic root dilatation FD is associated to an increased
risk of developing aortic root dilatation in male patients
[107]. Aortic root dilation was detected in 24% of 71
hemizygous male patients and was statistically associated
with the presence of a dolicho-ectatic basilar artery (p =
0.008) (Germain DP, unpublished data) (Figures 15 and
16) [107].
D. Cerebrovascular lesions
The early peripheral neuropathic hallmarks of FD
[38,108,109] are often followed by cerebrovascular com￾plications and autonomic dysfunction in adulthood.
Some of the most devastating neurological features of
FD are caused by cerebrovascular lesions - the result of
multifocal involvement of small blood vessels [110,111].
Cerebrovascular involvement can lead to a wide variety
of signs and symptoms, ranging from mild to severe,
including headache, vertigo/dizziness, transient ischemic
attacks, ischemic strokes (Figure 17) [111-113] and
more rarely vascular dementia [114,115]. Using data
from the Fabry Registry®, the prevalence of strokes in
FD was estimated to be 6.9% in males and 4.3% in
females, much higher than in the general population.
Median age at first stroke was 39 in men and 46 years
in women and stroke may be the first manifestation of
the disease [111]. There is a high prevalence of hyper￾tension, cardiac disease and renal disease in patients
who have had a stroke in the context of FD [111]. Data
from both the Fabry Registry® [111] and the Fabry Out￾come Survey® (FOS®) [110] have shown that the majority
of strokes in FD are due to small vessel events. A dila￾tive arteriopathy of the vertebrobasilar circulation has
also been documented (Figure 18) [112,116]. Thrombus
formation may be enhanced in FD due to the adhesion
of neutrophils and monocytes to endothelial cell walls
[117] or to changes in the regional cerebral hyperperfu￾sion [118-120]. Serum myeloperoxidase level has been
found to predict the risk of a vasculopathy-related event
in males affected with FD [121].
Imaging modalities that can be used to explore cerebro￾vascular involvement in Fabry patients include MRI [116],
trans-cranial Doppler (TCD) [122], proton MR spectro￾scopy (MRS), positron emission tomography (PET) and
diffusion tensor imaging [123]. White matter lesions may
be single, multiple or confluent on MRI (Figure 19)
[124,125]. In addition, diffuse neuronal involvement,
extending beyond the areas of MRI-visible cerebrovascular
abnormalities has been found, and in such cases, 1H-MRS

may be the preferred modality [126]. Cerebral MRI can
reveal periventricular white-matter lesions, microbleeds
(Figure 19), cortical grey-matter infarcts and deep lacunar
infarcts in both grey and white matter [111,127-130].
Some patients affected with FD have an aseptic meningitis
[113,131,132]. Hyperintensity in the pulvinar on T1-
weighted images is a common finding in FD, likely reflect￾ing the presence of calcification [133,134]. Recent findings
suggest that the pulvinar sign is a highly specific sign, dis￾tinctively characteristic of FD [135], more frequent in
male patients with cardiomyopathy and severe kidney
involvement (Colas F, Carlier RY and Germain DP,
unpublished data) (Figure 20).
In a pilot study, head MRI was performed in a cohort
of 44 consecutive hemizygous male patients and 7 het￾erozygous females affected with FD. Chiari type I mal￾formation was identified in 6 individuals (3 males and 3
females) [136]. Whether the association is coincidental
or not, does need further studies but Chiari malforma￾tion may explain the episodes of headache frequently
encountered in FD and should be ruled out in all Fabry
patients [136].
Comprehensive neurological evaluation is essential
before the institution of ERT, to assess disease extent
and severity. Frequency and severity of pain should be
assessed using tools such as the Brief Pain Inventory

(BPI) or the McGill Pain Inventory. Clinical investiga￾tions include brain imaging by MRI with T1, T2 and
FLAIR-weighted images and magnetic resonance angio￾graphy (MRA) may be indicated to exclude cerebral vas￾culopathy. Laboratory evaluation of comorbid stroke
risk factors may identify patients with significantly
elevated homocysteine, with a vitamin deficiency state,
or with other genetic prothrombotic risk factors [51].
E. Auditory and vestibular abnormalities
Auditory and vestibular abnormalities are frequent defi￾cits observed in FD, resulting in a range of symptoms,
such as hearing loss [137,138], tinnitus and vertigo

[137,139]. The high incidence of both progressive hear￾ing loss and sudden deafness in male patients affected
with classic FD has been demonstrated (Figure 21)
[137]. A correlation of neuropathic and vascular damage
with hearing loss was found in males in whom residual
a-galactosidase A activity appears to have a protective
effect against hearing loss [140]. Progressive vestibular
loss was found in 80% of males and 77% of females
when assessed with head impulse testing [141].
F. Ocular manifestations
Corneal opacities (visible by slit-lamp microscopy) are
the most common and early of ocular signs, occurring
in almost all hemizygous males (Figure 22) [142-144]. It
should be noted, however, that treatment with amiodar￾one or chloroquine can produce similar ophthalmologi￾cal signs [145]. Mild to marked tortuosity of the
conjunctival and retinal vessels is also observed in
patients with FD [142,143]. Neither corneal dystrophy

nor retinal/conjunctival lesions impair visual acuity;
however, acute visual loss caused by unilateral occlusion
of the central retinal artery has been reported [146].
Anterior and posterior subcapsular cataracts are also
observed, the latter also being termed the ‘Fabry
cataract’ in that it represents a pathognomonic ocular
sign of FD. More recently, an enlargement of the blind
spot (Figure 23) was reported in 38.7% (n = 27) of
patients, although this was not associated with any
defects in colour vision [142].

G. Respiratory involvement
Respiratory involvement, manifesting as dyspnea with
exercise, chronic cough and wheezing, is frequent in
both genders with FD [147,148]. A recent study has
found the prevalence of airway obstruction in FD to be
26% in women and 61% in men [149,150]. A clinically
relevant age- and gender-dependent progressive pul￾monary involvement in FD patients has been demon￾strated [150] and the effects of ERT on pulmonary
involvement are currently being investigated. Recently,
ERT was shown to stabilize obstructive pulmonary FD
associated with respiratory Gb3 storage in one heterozy￾gous female [151].
In another study, 39 patients with a diagnosis of FD
underwent pulmonary function testing (spirometry), and
a non-invasive cardiopulmonary exercise test. A control
group was selected for comparison. Eighteen of the 39
Fabry patients (46%) exhibited a significant decrease in
diastolic blood pressure (DBP) during exercise. The
drop in DBP was evident in 9 of the 24 female patients
(38%). None of the control patients had a significant
drop in DBP during exercise. The finding of a significant
decrease in DBP in patients with FD may explain defi￾cits in exercise tolerance [104].
H. Skeletal involvement
In a recent study, bone mineral density of the lumbar
spine and the femoral neck was assessed by dual-energy
X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) in 23 hemizygous male
patients with a mean age of 31 years (range: 16-60
years) affected with classic FD. Using the World Health
Organization classification, 20 of the 23 patients (88%)
with FD had either osteopenia (n =11) or osteoporosis
(n = 9) at one or both sites (Figure 24) [152,153]. Skele￾tal involvement has been subsequently confirmed in a
larger cohort of 53 patients in which osteopenia was
present in approximately 50% of cases [154]. Cases of
severe osteoporosis with spontaneous lumbar fractures
have recently been described (Figure 25) [155]. Patients

verticillata“. These opacities do not impair the visual acuity. Courtesy: Dr Juan-Manuel POLITEI, Buenos-Aires, Argentina.

suffering from Fabry disease should follow current
recommendations regarding identification and treatment
of vitamin D deficiency.
I. Depression and quality of life
Depression is a frequent and under-reported problem in
patients with FD [156]. As many as 46% and 28% of
patients may have depression and severe clinical depres￾sion, respectively [47]. Most patients identified in recent
surveys were undiagnosed for depression, which under￾scores the need for the correct assessment of depressive
symptoms in patients with FD. Since this is an under￾recognized problem, the benefits of treatment are
unknown. Depression can seriously impact quality of life in
patients with FD. Reduction in quality of life has been
demonstrated using a variety of questionnaires including
the SF-36, EuroQoL and MMPI-2 [46,157-159]. Psychiatric
and neuro-psychological evaluations have been recom￾mended in the assessment of patients with FD [160,161].
J. Miscellaneous
Anemia Data from the FOS® and the Fabry Registry® show
that mild peripheral blood cytopenias, particularly anemia
[162], are prevalent among patients with FD [163].
Arterial remodeling and intima-media thickening
Large artery phenotype (arterial wall structure and func￾tion) was non-invasively investigated in 21 hemizygous
patients with FD and 24 age-matched male controls.
Common carotid and radial artery diameter, intima￾media thickness (IMT) and distensibility were deter￾mined with high-definition echotracking systems and
aplanation tonometry. Patients with FD had a significant
twofold increase in radial artery IMT and distensibility,
independent of body surface area, age and mean blood

pressure. Radial artery IMT increased significantly with
age in each group. However, the slope was 2.3-fold
higher in FD patients than in controls (p < 0.001). Com￾mon carotid artery (CCA) IMT was mildly but signifi￾cantly increased in patients with FD (+18%), whereas
distensibility was unchanged [164,165].
Another study presented evidence of a major increase
in CCA IMT, both in hemizygous and heterozygous
patients with FD, in the absence of focal atherosclerotic
plaques [166]. The authors examined the possible corre￾lation between left ventricular hypertrophy and IMT of
the common carotid artery. Thirty male and 38 female
patients were enrolled. LVH was found in 60% of men
and 39% of women. Increased CCA IMT was equally
present in males and females. LVH and CCA IMT
occurred concomitantly in FD suggesting common
pathogenesis. The underlying cause may be a circulating
growth-promoting factor whose presence has been con￾firmed in vitro [167].
Azoospermia Testicular biopsies performed in two
infertile men suffering from FD with azoospermia
revealed characteristic aspects of trihexoside ceramide
(Gb3) deposits in Leydig cells by optical and electronic
microscopic analysis [168].
Facial dysmorphism Although facial dysmorphism is
not a prominent sign in FD, minor facial abnormalities
have been previously reported. By analysing three-dimen￾sional images of faces, facial dysmorphology was quanti￾fied in a cohort of both males and females affected with
FD. Morphometric analysis of different regions of the
face revealed significant differences in face shape in male
patients and to a lesser extent in female patients. In male
patients, the most prominent abnormalities were located
in the peri-orbital region. Pattern recognition techniques
achieved a discrimination accuracy of up to 85% for male
patients compared with healthy controls. The discrimina￾tion accuracy in female patients only reached 67% [169].
Hypothyroidism In a small study, subclinical hypothyr￾oidism (normal serum free thyroxine concentrations
along with elevated serum TSH levels) was found in 4
of 11 patients (36.4%) who were investigated [170]. An
endocrine work-up should be recommended in all
patients suffering from FD [171].
Lymphoedema Lymphoedema, already mentionned in
one of the original papers on FD [1], has since been
observed in a number of patients [58] and linked to
structural and functional changes of the lymphatic
microvessels of the skin [172].
Parapelvic kidney cysts Twenty-four patients who were
enrolled in an enzyme replacement trial underwent pro￾spective renal imaging evaluation with kidney MRI and
computed tomography (CT). Nineteen age-matched
healthy controls were concurrently enrolled in this
cross-sectionnal, case-control study. The presence and
localization of kidney cysts as well as the ratio of the
signal intensity between medulla and cortex were deter￾mined. Fifty percent of FD patients had renal sinus
cysts, compared to one individual (7%) in the control
group. The cause of such cysts in FD remains to be ela￾borated [173] but they may contribute to earlier recog￾nition of the disease [174].
Priapism Cases of priapism have been observed in
young boys affected with FD. Conventional treatment
with cavernovenous shunting was only partly successful
in one case, and percutaneous gelfoam embolization of
the internal pudendal artery may prove a better option
[175]. Additional cases of priapism associated with FD
were identified through a search of the literature [176].
K. Heterozygous females
Traditionally, it was considered that heterozygotes did
not develop symptoms and heterozygous females were
erroneously described as “carriers of the defective gene”
who were more or less safeguarded against developing
disease symptoms. However, an increasing number of
publications and evolving knowledge about the natural
course of disease indicate that the term X-linked reces￾sive should probably be discontinued and FD simply
described as following “X-linked inheritance” [177,178].
Clinical signs and symptoms vary widely in heterozy￾gous females. This phenotypic heterogeneity is thought
to be partly due to lyonization [179], a process whereby
one copy of the X-chromosome is randomly inactivated
in all cells of the female embryo, so that heterozygous
females are essentially a ‘mosaic’ of normal and mutant
cells in varying proportions. In X-linked diseases, het￾erozygous females may be symptomatic, probably as a
consequence of skewed X-chromosome inactivation,
which results in a higher percentage of the × chromo￾some bearing the mutant gene being expressed in the
particular tissue of importance. Such variability in symp￾tom severity is characteristic of X-linked heterozygotes
[180] and should be kept in mind when assessing and
diagnosing potential patients.
The clinical spectrum in females ranges from a see￾mingly asymptomatic disease course occasionally
observed to the “classic” severe phenotype observed in
males, with a variety of clinical presentations in between
[24,26,181-183]. Heterozygotes may display all symp￾toms of the disease including pain [184], orthostatic
hypotension [185], angiokeratoma [53], ocular abnorm￾alities [186], cochleovestibular involvement [51,139], gas￾trointestinal symptoms [50] and respiratory involvement
[150]. A high percentage of females develop vital organ
damage involving the heart [26,78,79,96,187,188], brain
[111,129,189-191] and, more rarely, kidneys
[26,32,73,76,186] about a decade later than males
[24,184]. Of the 1077 enrolled females in the Fabry Reg￾istry®, 69.4% had symptoms and signs of FD. The

median age at symptom onset among females was 13
years, and twenty percent experienced major cerebrovas￾cular, cardiac, or renal events, at a median age of 46
years [24].
In a retrospective chart review of 279 affected males
and 168 females suffering from Fabry disease, the mean
rate of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
decline for patients was -1.02 ml/min/1.73 m2
/year for
females as compared to -2.93 ml/min/1.73 m2
/year for
males and advanced Fabry nephropathy was less preva￾lent and occurred later among females than males [25].
Altogether, females with FD have a significant risk for
major organ involvement and decreased quality of life
[158], and should be regularly monitored for signs and
symptoms of FD [24,51].
L. Atypical variants
FD has long been regarded as a full-blown multisystemic
disease with most, if not all, affected males developing a
“classic” phenotype. Later on, the sub-classifications
“cardiac variant” [29] and “renal variant” [30] were
introduced for patients with predominant cardiac or
renal involvement, respectively. In high-risk adult popu￾lations, screening efforts have been shown to be effective
in diagnosing Fabry patients among individuals with
end-stage renal disease [30,192,193], unexplained cardiac
hypertrophy [194-196] or strokes in young people with
no apparent predisposing factors [197-200]. Screening of
patients with atherosclerosis [201] or ophthalmological
screening [202] may be of less value.
Atypical variants have few or none of the hallmark
symptoms of classical FD, but have manifestations con￾fined predominantly to one organ system [28,100]. Pre￾senting much later in life (fourth to sixth decades) than
patients with classical disease, they are often identified
serendipitously. In contrast to their classically affected
counterparts, atypical variants have residual a-galactosi￾dase A activity that varies between 2 and 20% of normal
[35,203,204].
Cardiac variant The cardiac variant - the most widely
reported atypical variant - presents with cardiac mani￾festations in the absence of overt systemic involvement
[28,29,100]. Manifestations include cardiomegaly, elec￾trocardiographic abnormalities consistent with cardio￾myopathy, non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
and myocardial infarctions; mild proteinuria may also be
detected.
The cardiac variant was initially thought to be rare,
but a Japanese study of 1603 males undergoing routine
echocardiography found that 7 (3%) of 230 patients with
left ventricular hypertrophy had clinically unsuspected
FD [29]. Furthermore, recent reports suggested that FD
should also be considered in all cases of unexplained
homogeneous hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [194-196].
In a British study, 6 of 153 males (4%) consecutively
referred with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were found
to have a-galactosidase A levels diagnostic of FD [194].
In a Spanish study, 0.9% of males and 1.1% of females
with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were diagnosed with
FD [195].
Renal variant There are also reports of hemizygous
males with disease manifestations confined to the kid￾ney. Renal variants have been identified among Japanese
chronic dialysis patients whose end-stage renal disease
had been misdiagnosed as chronic glomerulonephritis
[30]. The patients had absent or low a-galactosidase A
activity, and were, subsequently, found to have GLA
gene mutations [30]. These findings suggest that cases
of FD may be underdiagnosed among renal dialysis
[192] and transplant [205] patients. Their early detection
is important since these patients may later develop vas￾cular disease of the heart or brain. However, a much
lower prevalence of FD (0.22%) was found in both a
Dutch [206] and another Japanese [193] study per￾formed in similar high-risk groups of hemodialyzed
patients.
Intermediate variant Presentation and clinical course
can vary within the aforementioned phenotypes, and an
intermediate phenotype has been described in which
patients, in the absence of cardinal signs of FD in child￾hood, presented with a cardiac variant with hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia around age 40 but sub￾sequently progressed to end-stage kidney failure [207].
V - Etiology
A. Genetics
FD is transmitted as an X-linked trait. Contrary to the
misconception that females will be marginally affected
given the X-chromosome linked inheritance pattern,
many heterozygotes will develop early symptoms and,
later on, vital organ involvement [24,26,182]. The use of
the term X-linked ‘recessive’ is therefore misleading and
should be discontinued and FD described as following
X-linked inheritance [177,208].
B. Gene location
Lysosomal a-galactosidase A (EC 3.2.1.22) is coded by a
unique gene, GLA, whose locus is situated on the long
arm of chromosome X, in position Xq22. The GLA gene
consists of seven exons distributed over 12,436 base
pairs (bp). There is extensive allelic heterogeneity, but
no genetic locus heterogeneity.
C. Molecular pathology
FD can be caused by a variety of missense or nonsense
point mutations, splicing mutations, small deletions or
insertions [203,204,209-236], and large deletions
[237,238]. The defects in the GLA gene encoding a￾galactosidase A are heterogeneous with over 585 muta￾tions recorded [239,240]; the majority of these muta￾tions render the enzyme non-functional [239]. Most

families have unique mutations potentially explaining
the marked variability in the residual enzyme activity
but only in part the natural course of the disease since
intra-familial variability does exist. Novel a-galactosidase
A mutations have been recently identified by our
research group [e.g. p.Met42Arg (c.125T > G) (Figure
26), p.Gly43Ser (c.127G > A), p.Gly132Glu (c.395G >
A), p.Lys168Asn (c.504A > C), p.Gln212Stop (c.634C >
T), p.Phe295Cys (c.884T > G) (Figure 26), p.Leu300Pro
(c.899T > C), and p.Gly328Glu (c.983G > A), D.P. Ger￾main, unpublished data]. Non pathological single
nucleotide polymorphisms such as c.-30G > A, c.-12G >
A, and c.-10C > T in the 5’ untranslated region (5’UTR),
p.Asp313Tyr in exon 6 [241] and other sequence varia￾tions (VNTR) have been described [239,242,243].
Whether some published sequence changes, such as p.
Arg112His, are true mutations or polymorphisms is still
a matter of debate [244].
D. Structure of human a-Galactosidase A
The three-dimensional structure of human a-galactosi￾dase A was determined by x-ray crystallography. The
crystal structure showed a homodimeric molecule with
each monomer containing two domains. The N-terminal
domain is a classic (b/a)8 barrel, and the C-terminal
domain contains eight antiparallel b strands packed into
a b sandwich. Residues 32-328 comprise the N-terminal
domain, and residues 329-421 fold into the C-terminal
antiparallel domain. The N-terminal domain contains
the active site, which is located at the C-terminal end of
b strands b1-b7, near the center of the b barrel. Three

N-linked carbohydrates are found on the surface of the
molecule, away from the location of the active site and
away from the dimer interface. The carbohydrate resi￾dues attach to aspartic acid residues N139, N192 and
N215 and extend from the surface of the molecule
[245]. The enzyme folds into a three dimensional fold
that gathers 15 residues into an active site configuration
specific for a-galactosides. The active site is formed
from side chain residues of W47, D92, D93, Y134, C142,
K168, D170, C172, E203, L206, Y207, R227, D231, D266,
and M267. Residues C142 and C172 make a disulfide
bond. The two active sites in the dimer are separated by
approximately 50 Å [245]. The a-galactosidase A
enzyme uses a double displacement reaction mechanism,
where two consecutive nucleophilic attacks on the
anomeric carbon of the substrate lead to breakage of the
glycosidic linkage with overall retention of the anomer
of the product. In human a-galactosidase A, the cataly￾tic nucleophile is D170 and the catalytic acid/base is
D231 [246].
VI - Diagnosis
Early onset of FD signs and symptoms warrant prompt
diagnosis, particularly because ERT is available. How￾ever, recognizing the early manifestations in clinical
practice may be challenging due to a variety of reasons.
The disease presentation is generally heterogeneous,
symptoms may resemble more common diseases, and
major renal or cardiac dysfunction is uncommon in
pediatric patients. Nowadays, diagnostic delays may still
be considerable and patients often have to visit several
medical specialists before a correct diagnosis is made.
Recent data showed that the overall diagnostic delays
were ~15 years for both genders [24]. If clinical exami￾nation raises a suspicion of FD, appropriate biochemical
and/or genetic confirmation is needed [247].
A. Biochemical diagnosis
Enzymatic assay The demonstration of a deficient
activity of a-galactosidase activity in plasma or leuko￾cytes is the reference laboratory method which should
systematically be used to confirm the clinical diagnosis
of FD in males in whom the result will be conclusive
[248]. Plasma assay may occasionally lead to false diag￾nosis and should be confirmed by a leukocyte assay
[249]. In contrast, affected girls and adult females may
have their enzyme activity falling within the normal
range [250]. Therefore, all females should have their sta￾tus determined by genotyping (analysis of the GLA gene
mutation) [208].
A fluorimetric method that uses filter paper cards
containing dried blood spots instead of the leukocyte
pellet as the enzyme source was recently introduced for
enzymatic diagnosis, allowing storage of the samples for
up to 6 months due to stability of the enzyme [251-255].
Globotriaosylceramide measurement Plasma Gb3 has
also been proposed and used in the biochemical diagno￾sis of FD, but this method is time-consuming and, in
females, plasma Gb3 levels are generally lower than in
males and usually in the normal range [256].
Urinary Gb3 is a more reliable marker allowing diag￾nosis in the majority of both male and female patients
[257-260]. However urinary Gb3 is not elevated in some
patients with late-onset variants and/or particular muta￾tions in the GLA gene (p.Asn215Ser) [261-263].
The analysis of tissue glycolipid composition [264] and
the use of atmospheric pressure photoionization mass
spectrometry (APPI-MS) for the analysis of Gb3 molecu￾lar species [265] and MALDI-TOF imaging of biomar￾kers [266] are not done routinely and are confined to
research laboratories.
B. Genotyping
In female heterozygotes, a-galactosidase activity may be
within the normal range [250,252] and therefore, the
definitive diagnostic confirmation should be made by
genetic analysis in suspected cases (Figure 26). The pub￾lication of the complementary (cDNA) [267] and geno￾mic DNA [268] sequences of the GLA gene (Genbank
X14448) has paved the way towards understanding of
the molecular basis of FD. Direct molecular analysis is
easy because of the small size of the gene and allows the
precise characterization of the mutation of the GLA
gene. A method that uses filter paper cards containing
dried blood spots instead of the leukocytes pellet as the
source of DNA was recently developed for sequencing,
allowing genotyping from a dried blood spot on filter
paper to confirm enzymatic diagnosis (Figure 27) [196].
Denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography
(DHPLC) has been shown to be useful as a screening
method [269]. Since direct sequencing limited to exons
may miss deletions, the use of Multiplex Ligation￾dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) has been
recommended in cases where a decreased enzyme activ￾ity is not associated with the identification of a patho￾genic point mutation [270].
C. Screening
Screening individuals with a family history of FD or
newborn screening programs are the only practical ways
of identifying patients before the development of symp￾toms. Moreover, screening of patients in high risk
groups who may be exhibiting late-onset symptoms of
FD but who have not been diagnosed may be key in
optimizing the management of disease in these patients.
Any screening requires a reliable and preferably rapid
and low-cost method. Measurement of the accumulated
urinary Gb3 has been proposed [258], but its reliability
as a biomarker of FD, particularly in females, is unpro￾ven [262,271]. Screening of at-risk groups is often con￾ducted by measuring plasma a-galactosidase A activity,

but clinicians should be aware that this can fail to detect
all cases of FD [272]. Identification of the deficient enzyme
activity in dried blood spots (DBS) may be a more reliable
method of screening for FD and this approach has been
validated in males [198,250-252,273,274] but fails to detect
about one third of heterozygous females [250,252,253].
D. Histology
Light microscopy The observation of biopsies with light
microscopy does not usually contribute a great deal to
diagnosis but lipid staining of kidney biopsies can reveal
storage cells within glomeruli and, when electron micro￾scopy (EM) is not being done or not available, semi-thin
sections stained with toluidine blue or Masson’s tri￾chrome can allow diagnosis (Figures 3 and 4). However,
given the number of false negatives and the non specifi￾city of the results, this invasive procedure should not be
used for diagnostic purpose.
Electron microscopy Ultrastructural studies of endomyo￾cardial and kidney biopsies can reveal lysosomal storage
in cardiomyocytes or in a variety of kidney cellular types,
respectively. The ultrastructural appearance of the inclu￾sions is of whorled layers of alternating dense and pale
material (’zebra bodies’ or myelin figures) (Figures 5, 6
and 7). However, due to the invasive nature of the proce￾dure and the availability of reliable biochemical or mole￾cular methods, these procedures should be considered
only in the rare instances where there is residual a-galac￾tosidase A activity in males or doubts on the causality of
a DNA sequence change in females. Skin biopsy observed
by EM may be a useful additional diagnostic test when
carefully interpreted by an expert pathologist [275]. How￾ever, acquired metabolic disorders, such as the one
induced by chloroquine therapy, may result in storage of
ultrastructurally similar inclusions in many of the same
cells as FD, leading to erroneous interpretation [276]. In
addition, skin biopsies are often normal in heterozygous
females and therefore not of great utility.
E. Ancillary markers
Although laboratory tests are usually normal, anemia [162],
hyperhomocysteinemia [277], raised HDL cholesterol [278]
and elevated Lp(a) (Germain DP, unpublished data) have
been reported in a number of patients with FD. Urinary
sediment examination can reveal casts, erythrocytes and
cells containing accumulated Gb3. Elevated serum levels of
B natriuretic peptide (BNP) and troponin IC have been
found in patients with advanced left ventricular hypertro￾phy (Germain DP, unpublished data). 25(OH) vitamin D
levels should be investigated in all patients suffering from
FD since vitamin D deficiency is found in about 40% of
them in France (Germain DP, unpublished data).
F. Biomarkers
One of the most urgent research needs is for (a) reliable
and validated biomarker(s) with which to assess disease
progression and treatment response. Ideally, measure￾ment of such (a) surrogate marker(s) would involve
non-invasive testing. Although various imaging techni￾ques have shown promising results, the clinical rele￾vance of what they reveal in patients with FD has yet to
be evaluated for its correlation with clinical endpoints.
There is currently no proper plasma or urinary biomar￾ker for FD.
Mildly elevated plasma chitotriosidase levels have been
reported in male patients but not in heterozygous
females [279].
Globotriaosylsphingosine or lyso-Gb3 has been
reported to be elevated in FD patients. This analyte is
elevated in the plasma of hemizygous males and to a
lesser extent in that of adult females with classical FD
and lyso-Gb3 appears interesting to monitor enzyme
replacement therapy [244,280]. Lyso-Gb3 was shown to
be an independent risk factor for the development of
cerebrovascular white matter lesions in male patients
with FD while, in females, plasma lyso-Gb3 concentra￾tion correlated with overall disease severity [281].
Figure 27 Sequencing of PCR products obtained from amplification of DNA directly eluted from a 3-mm punch of dried blood spot
(DBS) on filter paper: a 60-year-old man with left ventricular hypertrophy of unknown origin was enrolled in a screening protocol for FD.
Markedly decreased a-galactosidase activity was found on DBS. Using a second DBS, the patient was subsequently shown to carry a T to C
transition in exon 2 at position 337 in the cDNA sequence of the GLA gene (c.337T > C). This nucleotide substitution alters the codon (TTT) for
phenylalanine to the codon (CTT) for leucine at position 113 of the a-galactosidase A protein (p.Phe113Leu). Pr Dominique GERMAIN, University

Page 24 of 49

Lyso-Gb3 could be a potential biomarker since plasma
lyso-Gb3 level in Fabry patients who had received ERT
was shown to be elevated at baseline and to fall more
dramatically on ERT than that of Gb3 [282]. Urinary
lyso-Gb3 may also prove a potential biomarker [283].
Lyso-Gb3 may have a role in glomerular injury in FD by
promoting the release of secondary mediators of glo￾merular injury (Transforming growth factor-beta1
(TGF-b1) and the macrophage inhibitory factor receptor
CD74) common to diabetic nephropathy [284].
Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) was recently identified
as a biologically active growth-promoting factor involved
in cardiovascular remodelling in both males and females
with FD [285]. Male patients had significantly higher
plasma S1P levels compared with healthy controls.
Moreover, there was a strong correlation between
plasma S1P levels and LVM index, and increased com￾mon carotide artery IMT in patients with FD [285].
Sphingosine-1 phosphate has been shown to induce in
vitro vascular smooth muscle cells proliferation by a
variety of signal transduction pathways [285].
In the interest of future research, biobanking of
plasma, serum and urine samples remains highly recom￾mended in all patients affected with FD prior to initia￾tion of ERT.
VII - Differential diagnosis
In childhood, other possible causes of pain such as
rheumatoid arthritis [286], rheumatic fever, systemic
lupus erythematosus, Raynaud’s disease, and ‘growing
pains’ (a frequent misdiagnosis in children with FD)
must be ruled out. In adulthood, celiac disease and mul￾tiple sclerosis [287] are the most often-cited differential
diagnoses particularly in females. Similarly, when no
mutation of the GLA gene has been identified, the pos￾siblity of a phenocopy mimicking FD, should be consid￾ered [288].
Finally, whether a combination of several single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the GLA gene lead￾ing to decreased but residual a-galactosidase activity
may be a risk factor and predispose to hypertrophic car￾diomyopathy and/or ischemic stroke, when combined
with additional environmental or genetic factors, is
unknown and warrants further studies.
VIII - Genetic counseling
In contrast to the vast majority of lysosomal storage dis￾orders, which are inherited in an autosomal recessive
manner, FD, together with mucopolysaccharidosis type
II (Hunter syndrome) and Danon disease (LAMP2 defi￾ciency), is inherited as an X-linked trait [208]. Conse￾quently, there is no male-to-male transmission of FD,
but affected fathers will pass the defective gene to all
their daughters, while heterozygous females have a 50%
risk with each conception of transmitting the gene; sons
who inherit the mutant gene from their mother will
have the disease, while daughters will be heterozygotes
who may or may not develop disease manifestations.
Once the diagnosis has been confirmed, the opinion of
a geneticist should be sought and family screening car￾ried out [289]. Pedigree analysis and effective screening
of the family of a diagnosed (adult) patient is likely to
result in identification of several previously unrecog￾nized affected family members, including young relatives
at a relatively early stage of their disease [208,290]. This
provides the opportunity to offer genetic counseling and
timely therapeutic intervention [290]. Appropriate family
support should be provided which may be achieved
through the help of patients’ associations (Appendix).
IX - Prenatal diagnosis
Biochemical or molecular prenatal diagnosis of FD is
technically feasible by determination of a-gal A activity
in direct and/or cultured chorionic villi at 10 weeks of
pregnancy or in cultured amniotic cells at about 14
weeks of pregnancy, respectively. Determination of fetal
sex using maternal blood at 9-11 weeks of pregnancy is
occasionnaly used. Genetic counseling prior to prenatal
diagnosis should be provided to discuss the options and
risks since intra-familial phenotype variations, existence
of atypical late-onset variants and recent availability of a
specific therapy have singularly complicated genetic
counseling and prenatal diagnosis. For ethical reasons,
prenatal diagnosis of FD has always been controversial
for female fetuses and has now become questionable
even for males fetuses since the advent of ERT. There is
limited experience with preimplantation diagnosis of
FD, but the diagnosis has been performed successfully
(no reports in the literature) [291].
X - Management
FD is a paradigm of a multi-system condition and symp￾toms express themselves in many organs [25,51,292,293].
Maximal, comprehensive therapy for FD includes ERT
[294-298], conventional medical treatment [51] and
adjunctive therapies [181,299,300].
A. Conventional medical treatment and adjunctive therapies
for Fabry disease related morbidities
Supportive care is important. The effective management
of FD requires a multidisciplinary approach [301].
Symptom management in patients may consist of life￾style modifications and prophylactic medications
[51,299].
Pain Patients with neuropathic pain may benefit from
avoidance of circumstances triggering acute pain attacks,
e.g. significant physical exertion and temperature
changes. The neuropathic pain associated with FD can
be managed with analgesics, but nonsteroidal anti￾Germain Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2010, 5:30
http://www.ojrd.com/content/5/1/30
Page 25 of 49

inflammatory drugs are generally ineffective (and poten￾tially harmful for kidney function) while narcotic analge￾sics should be avoided [292] although this has been
debated [302]. Carbamazepine [303,304], oxcarbazepin,
gabapentin [299,305], pregabalin and phenytoin [306]
are classically used to manage pain in FD (Table 3)
[51,299]. Some patients use illicit drugs, particularly
marijuana for pain control and GI manifestations, espe￾cially if their symptoms have been overlooked by
doctors.
Gastrointestinal symptoms Gastrointestinal problems
resulting from delayed gastric emptying and slow bowel
movements may respond to metoclopramide [307] and
changes in eating habits, e.g. small and frequent meals.
Some success has been achieved by managing dyspepsia
with H-2 blockers [51].
Skin symptoms Laser methods to treat angiokeratomas
have not shown good results in FD and are not able to
prevent the formation of new lesions [57].
Cochleo-vestibular symptoms Moderate hearing loss
can be managed with hearing aids while profound deaf￾ness requires cochlear implants [51,137]. Vertigo-related
nausea can be addressed with trimethobenzamide or
prochlorperazine [51].

Renal function FD is often associated with proteinuric
chronic kidney disease, and it appears that the treatment
paradigms that have proven to be effective in diabetes
mellitus and other forms of proteinuric renal disease are
also effective in FD [308]. The use of angiotensin-con￾verting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin recep￾tor blockers (ARBs) is useful in patients with proteinuria
(Table 3) [299]. Furthermore, these agents may help to
control hypertension when present. Indeed, severe pro￾teinuria does not respond to ERT alone [309], but care￾fully titrated ACEi/ARB therapy may be effective in
lowering proteinuria [299,310,311]. In a pilot study, sus￾tained reductions in proteinuria with stabilization of kid￾ney function were achieved in a small number of
patients with severe Fabry nephropathy receiving a com￾bination of agalsidase beta at 1 mg/kg every other week
(EOW) and ACEi/ARB therapy [312].
Although FD represents an interesting example of
progressive proteinuric renal disease in which the usual
blood pressure is lower than in other renal diseases,
hypertension can occur and, if present [313], should be
treated appropriately. Many patients with FD and renal
involvement will require dialysis [314] and/or renal
transplant [315,316]. Transplanted kidneys remain free
of Gb3 accumulation and 5-year organ survival is above
average for renal transplants [315-318].
Cerebrovascular involvement The use of enteric coated
aspirin for prophylaxis to minimize the risk of stroke is
recommended in guidelines proposed by clinical experts
[51]. Clopidrogel will be considered if aspirin is not tol￾erated and a combination of both drugs may be pro￾posed in case of stroke or transient ischemic attack.
Coumadin is often given to patients who have had
stroke on aspirin and clopidrogel. Adequate intake of
vitamins B12, B9, and B6 should be promoted [51] espe￾cially in case of hyperhomocysteinemia [277]. Statins
may have potential beneficial effects [319].
Cardiac involvement In the case of exertion chest pain,
conventional anti-anginal therapy should be administered
(calcium channel blockers that do not limit heart rate
may be preferred to b-blockers as the later can aggravate
both sinus bradycardia and the fact that some patients
have a propensity to develop atrioventricular [AV]
block). Beta-blockers are not necessarily contraindicated
but should be used cautiously. Aspirin can be prescribed
in case of isolated left atrial enlargement and warfarin
treatment should be offered to any patient affected with
FD and atrial fibrillation. Cardiac pacing or implantation
of cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) devices is increasingly
used in patients with FD with AV block or to prevent
sudden cardiac death due to sustained ventricular tachy￾cardia and malignant arrhythmia [81]. Amiodarone inter￾feres with lysosome metabolism and should therefore
probably be avoided during enzyme replacement. If there
is evidence of heart failure, ACEi, ARBs or diuretics
should be preferred to b-blockers because of the afore￾mentioned caveats [88]. In patients with advanced con￾gestive heart failure, heart transplantation is an option
[207,320]. Vitamin D levels and lipid profil should be
controlled and, if anormal, normalized, using both diet
and statins for the later (Table 3).
Respiratory involvement Cessation of smoking should
be encouraged [299].
Endocrine dysfunction Adequate monitoring of endo￾crine glands and hormonal therapy, when required, have
to be performed in cases of subclinical endocrine dys￾function [171].
Bone involvement Although no data exist, the use of
biphosphonate therapy is currently being investigated.
Vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency should also be
corrected.
Psychological aspects Psychological support should be
provided. Anxiety and depression should be treated
[159,161].
B. Prophylactic measures
Patients should be advised to carry with them a letter
and/or an emergency healthcare card (Figure 28)
Figure 28 Emergency healthcare card from the French Ministry
of Health: an emergency healthcare card was created by the
Ministry of Health, the center of excellence for Fabry disease and
patients’ associations for Fabry disease or lysosomal storage
diseases. The card is made of two parts: one of which contains
general data on FD while the second one includes the personal
medical history and medications of the patient in order to provide
useful information for emergency care situations.

indicating the nature of their illness, the complications
to which they are at risk, their current medication and
the contact details of a medical practitioner. Intense
physical activity and excessive sun exposure are inadvi￾sable. Various medications such as chloroquine or amio￾darone interfere with lysosome metabolism and their
prescription is contraindicated in the license of recombi￾nant a-galactosidase A (agalsidase alfa and agalsidase
beta), and should therefore be avoided during enzyme
replacement.
XI - Enzyme replacement therapy
Conventional treatment does not address the underlying
defect of FD and the year 2001 witnessed the introduc￾tion of ERT using recombinant human a-galactosidase
A. Since then, long term safety and efficacy of replace￾ment therapy have been investigated and ERT has been
validated as a disease-specific therapeutic agent for
patients affected with FD but with this, has come the
realization that numerous aspects have yet to be
explored and understood. As an example, current guide￾lines for starting ERT in patients vary from one country
to another and remain a matter of debate especially in
heterozygous females and children. Current expert
recommendations [51] are presented in Table 4, but
may evolve in the future. In Europe, there are currently
two commercially available enzyme preparations for FD
[321,322]: agalsidase alfa (Replagal®; Shire, Cambridge,
MA, USA), produced using cultured human skin fibro￾blasts and registered for use at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg
biweekly, and agalsidase beta (Fabrazyme®; Genzyme
Corp, Cambridge, MA, USA), produced by the expres￾sion of human a-galactosidase cDNA in Chinese Ham￾ster Ovary (CHO) cells and registered for a use at 1.0
mg/kg biweekly. The safety and efficacy of both enzymes
have been assessed in randomized, double-blind, pla￾cebo-controlled trials [323-326] and their extension stu￾dies for agalsidase alfa [327,328] and agalsidase beta
[309,329], studies originating from industry-sponsored
registries [330-333] and investigator-sponsored studies
independent from the industry [334-338]. Hereunder,
we review the clinical efficacy data currently available
for each drug since their marketing authorization within
the European Union [339,340].
A. Efficacy and safety data of agalsidase alfa treatment
Agalsidase alfa (Replagal®; Shire, Cambridge, MA, USA)
is an enzyme replacement therapy for FD. Agalsidase
alfa first received marketing authorization in the Eur￾opean Union in August 2001, and is approved for the
treatment of FD in 45 countries. Agalsidase alfa is puri￾fied from a stably transfected human cell line and is
infused at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg of body weight over a
period of 40 minutes every 14 days [294,341]. Double￾blind, randomized clinical trials of ERT with agalsidase
alfa in FD involved relatively small numbers of patients
[324,326] and most of the data presented here originates
from industry-sponsored FOS® or open-label clinical
trials.
Amelioration of early clinical symptoms In two pedia￾tric clinical trials of ERT with agalsidase alfa, including
37 children [342,343], boys demonstrated reductions in
plasma Gb3 levels, and both boys and girls reported
reductions in neuropathic pain and in the use of neuro￾pathic pain medications. Heart rate variability, which is
classically reduced in boys with FD, was statistically sig￾nificantly improved with 6 months of agalsidase alfa
treatment [342-344]. With the possible exception of
clearance in younger patients, agalsidase alpha appears
to have comparable pharmacokinetic and pharmacody￾namic profiles in pediatric and adult Fabry patients of
both genders [345]. In the 3.5-year extension study of
one of the pediatric clinical trials, there were sustained,
statistically significant improvements in the clinical fea￾tures of FD, including reduced plasma Gb3 levels,
reduced pain severity assessed by the brief pain inven￾tory (BPI) questionnaire, and improved heart rate varia￾bility. Mean urine Gb3 levels were reduced to normal
range. Kidney function and left ventricular mass indexed
to height remained stable throughout the study [346].
In a small open-label study, improvements in acropar￾esthesia and anhidrosis were associated with a normali￾zation of sympathetic skin responses after 2 years on
agalsidase alfa [347].
In a larger cohort of patients from the FOS® observa￾tional database, pain severity was significantly reduced in
81 patients on agalsidase alfa for 2 years and in 62
patients on agalsidase alfa for 3 years, and all dimensions
of pain perception were improved [43]. Improvements in

Note: the recommendations are proposed guidelines from an international panel of physicians with expertise in Fabry disease [51]. They are currently not
followed in every country and may be revised when additional studies on the outcome of the safety and efficacy of enzyme replacement therapy become
available.

health-related quality of life (QoL) paralleled improve￾ments in pain and were maintained after 24 months of
ERT [330,331].
In an analysis of agalsidase alfa replacement therapy in
patients with FD who were enrolled in the FOS®, a clini￾cally significant reduction of pain (defined as improve￾ment of >1 point on the BPI) was recorded for average
and worst pain (60.4% and 53.1% of patients, respec￾tively) after 5 years of treatment [333]. Before initiation
of ERT, QoL was worse in patients with FD than in the
general population. Mean QoL deviation score from
normal EuroQol values improved significantly compared
with baseline after 5 years of treatment [from - 0.24
(0.30) to - 0.17 (0.28) p = 0.0483] [333].
There are several reports suggesting that ERT with
agalsidase alfa may ameliorate the abdominal pain and
diarrhea associated with FD. A reduction in the inci￾dence of GI pain in 62 patients was shown after 12
months of ERT (from 49% to 39% of patients) and in 58
patients after 24 months of ERT [50]. The prevalence of
diarrhea was also reduced after 12 and 24 months of
ERT compared with baseline, the absence of a control
group being a limitation of this study [50].
Renal function In several studies, the estimated glomer￾ular filtration rate (eGFR) and creatinine clearance
remained stable after 1-2 years of ERT [330,332,348].
However, in a study aiming to determine the effects of
ERT with agalsidase alpha on renal function in patients
with Fabry nephropathy, eGFR declined in males with
stage 1 and 2 kidney disease treated by agalsidase alfa at
0.2 mg/kg during 3 years, although proteinuria was
under 1 g/24 h in all patients enrolled in this open-label
study [349].
In patients whose renal function continues to decline
while receiving agalsidase alfa at 0.2 mg/kg (eGFR
decline of ≥ 5 mL/min/1.73 m2
/year), there may be ben￾efits from doubling the dose through weekly infusions
rather than infusions every 2 weeks (mean rate of
change in eGFR improved from - 8.0 ml/min/1.73 m2
/
year to - 3.3 ml/min/1.73 m2
/year; p = 0.01) [328].
A recent meta-analysis showed that ERT with agalsi￾dase alfa appears to slow down the decline in GFR in
patients with mild to moderate nephropathy and base￾line proteinuria under 1 g per day [350]. Patients with
more advanced nephropathy and/or overt proteinuria
did not respond as well to agalsidase alfa alone. No his￾tological data was shown with respect to clearance of
Gb3 from podocytes or other renal cell types. Treatment
with agalsidase alfa did not improve proteinuria [350].
Cardiac morphology and function In an open-label
study, significant reductions in left ventricular mass
(LVM) were observed in heterozygous women after 27
weeks on agalsidase alfa [351]. Mean ventricular wall
thickness and LVM were reduced in a larger cohort of
patients from the FOS® after 1 and 2 years of ERT [330].
Of note, the largest decreases in LVM were observed in
patients with the greatest degree of hypertrophy at base￾line [330], a result that contrasts with those from a
number of studies with agalsidase beta [20,91,338,352].
In a double-blind randomized clinical trial on a small
number of patients with FD and cardiac involvement,
ERT resulted in a progressive decrease in LVM mea￾sured by MRI (p = 0.041) after 6 months on agalsidase
alfa at 0.2 mg/kg every other week [326]. Cardiomyocyte
Gb3 clearance which was the primary efficacy endpoint
did not reach statistical significance [326].
In an analysis of agalsidase alfa replacement therapy in
patients with FD who were enrolled in the FOS®, treat￾ment resulted in a sustained reduction in LVM index
from 71.4 g/m2.7 (SD 22.5) to 64.1 g/m2.7 (SD 18.7) after
5 years (p = 0.0111) and a significant increase in mid￾wall fractional shortening from 14.3% (SD = 2.3) to
16.0% (SD = 3.8) after 3 years (p = 0.02) [333]. Sentinel
clinical cardiac and cerebrovascular events occurred in a
greater proportion of patients with LVH than without
LVH after 5 years of treatment [333].
Cerebrovascular events Initial results on the effect of
agalsidase alfa (0.2 mg/kg every other week) on CNS
involvement in FD showed progression of white matter
lesions in 2 out of 7 patients [128]. This study involved
a small number of patients with a limited follow-up for
1 year [128] and, to date, it is not known if agalsidase
alfa therapy can reduce or prevent the cerebrovascular
complications and hearing loss associated with FD [353].
During the 4.5 year follow-up study of the original phase
III pivotal trial, four out of the 25 patients (16%) suf￾fered a cerebrovascular accident or a transient ischemic
attack [327].
Severity score and causes of death Score index of FD
severity, such as the Mainz Severity Score Index (MSSI)
[354], have shown a general reduction in disease severity
after one year of ERT with agalsidase alfa [355,356].
Data on causes of death in a cohort of 1453 patients
(699 male and 754 female) from 19 countries worldwide
enrolled in the FOS® were analysed, while causes of
death of their affected relatives were analysed separately.
The principal causes of death among 181 affected rela￾tives of patients in FOS®, most of who had died before
2001, were renal failure in males (42%) and cerebrovas￾cular disease in females (25%). In contrast, of the 42
patients enrolled in the FOS® whose deaths were
reported between 2001 and 2007, cardiac disease was
the main cause of death in both male (34%) and female
(57%) patients [87].
B. Efficacy and safety data of agalsidase beta treatment
Agalsidase beta (Fabrazyme®, Genzyme Corporation,
Cambridge, MA, USA) is indicated for long-term ERT in
patients with a confirmed diagnosis of FD. It is intended

to replace deficient endogenous a-galactosidase A in
these patients. World-wide, agalsidase beta is currently
approved in 55 countries, including the USA. In February
2008, the European Medicine Agency’s Committee for
Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) granted full
marketing authorization to Fabrazyme® superseding its
approval under exceptional circumstances [Fabrazyme®
Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC)] [339].
Clearance of Gb3 from renal cells, urine and cardiac
cells Renal capillary endothelial cells were (nearly) com￾pletely cleared of Gb3 after 20 weeks of agalsidase beta at
1 mg/kg EOW in 98% of the patients in the original mul￾ticenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind
phase III clinical trial [323]. Complete clearance of Gb3
was also observed in mesangial and interstitial cells in
the majority of patients [357]. All improvements were
maintained with sustained treatment over 4.5 years, and
signs of contained improvement in clearance from
epithelial cells (podocytes, distal tubular epithelial cells)
were noted, although Gb3 was never completely cleared
from podocytes [309]. Reductions were less complete in
non-capillary smooth muscle cells. The capacity of agalsi￾dase beta at 1 mg/kg EOW to normalize Gb3 content of
renal capillary endothelial cells after 20 weeks of treat￾ment was confirmed in a bridging study in 13 Japanese
male patients [358]. Urinary Gb3 excretion was reduced
in both studies after 20 weeks of therapy [323,358].
In the heart, 5 months of agalsidase beta treatment in
the phase III clinical trial [323] resulted in complete clear￾ance of Gb3 from the microvasculature in 72% of treated
patients compared with only 3% of placebo-treated
patients (p < 0.001) [359]. The placebo group achieved
similar results after 6 months of treatment in the open￾label extension study [359]. In addition, the capillary
endothelium remained free of Gb3 for up to 60 months
[309] in 6 of 8 patients who consented to an end-of-study
cardiac biopsy [359]. No clearance of Gb3 was observed in
the cardiomyocytes during the trial [359].
Of note, repeated infusions with agalsidase beta over a
prolonged period did not appreciably clear storage
material in cells other than vascular endothelial cells in
two case reports [360,361]. In the samples from the
heart and some other tissues biopsied from two male
patients after several months of ERT with agalsidase
beta, only the endothelial cells were free of Gb3 and per￾sistent storage was found in cardiomyocytes, smooth
muscle cells, fibroblasts and sweat glands [361]. Simi￾larly, extensive glycolipid storage deposits were seen in
all organ systems with the exception of vascular
endothelial cells in the autopsy study of a 47-year-old
male patient who died after 2.5 years of ERT with agal￾sidase beta [360].
Amelioration of early clinical symptoms Fourteen
boys and 2 girls, 8 to 16 years old, were treated in an
open-label pediatric clinical trial. A 12-week-observation
period to collect baseline data preceeded the 48-week￾treatment period when agalsidase beta (1 mg/kg) was
infused intravenously at 1 mg/kg EOW. No primary effi￾cacy endpoint was specified [362]. Before treatment,
results of skin biopsies from 12 male patients showed
moderate or severe Gb3 accumulation in superficial der￾mal capillary endothelial cells; with treatment, these
cells were completely cleared of Gb3 in week-24 biopsies
from all 12 male patients and in all available week-48
biopsies. Agalsidase beta was generally well tolerated;
most treatment-related adverse events were mild or
moderate with infusion-associated reactions involving
rigors, fever, or rhinitis. Children treated with agalsidase
beta experienced less pain and gastrointestinal problems,
and were reported to have more energy and improved
school attendance as documented by patients’ diaries
[362]. No overall significant change in serum creatinine,
mild proteinuria and eGFR was found in pediatric
patients after 48 weeks of treatment [362].
In the extension study of the original phase III trial in
adult patients, pain scores as measured by the McGill
Pain Questionnaire improved over time with sustained
agalsidase beta treatment at 1 mg/kg EOW for those
who reported pain at baseline and use of pain medica￾tions was reduced in some patients [309,329]. For most
SF-36 components, patients experienced a mean
improvement after long-term treatment with agalsidase
beta (Fabrazyme®). The mean changes from pretreat￾ment through month 54 for the components of Physical
Functioning, Role Emotional, Body Pain, and Standar￾dized Physical Component Scale (for patients with score
<100 at first measurement before treatment) were statis￾tically significant (p < 0.015, 0.031, 0.003, and 0.006,
respectively) [309].
Pain reduction was also found in 2 other studies after
~20 months of agalsidase beta therapy at 1 mg/kg EOW
[334,363]. One of these studies evaluated nerve fiber
function in 22 males with Fabry neuropathy and
reported subclass-dependent improvements in small
nerve fiber function [363]. Such improvements were not
seen in patients with severe thermal perception dysfunc￾tion at baseline [363].
Health-related quality of life was also measured using
the SF-36® health survey in 71 men and 59 women
enrolled in the Fabry Registry® who were treated with
agalsidase beta and who had baseline and at least 2
yearly post-treatment health-related quality of life mea￾surements. Long-term treatment with agalsidase beta
resulted in substantial improvements in health-related
quality of life in both men and women [364].
Renal function It has been shown that renal function in
adult patients can be preserved with sustained treatment
with agalsidase beta at 1 mg/kg EOW [309]. Estimated

glomerular filtration rate, proteinuria and serum creati￾nine remained stable and normal in the vast majority of
patients treated for 4.5 years (54 months) [309]. The 6
patients showing a rise in serum creatinine shared a
common profile at baseline including age >40 (n = 4/6),
high proteinuria levels (> 2 g/24 h, n = 4/6) and signifi￾cant glomerulosclerosis (> 50%, n = 4/4). This profile
predisposed them to progression of renal disease, even
under agalsidase beta therapy. The mean rate of eGFR
decline for the remaining patients (n = 52) as a group
was 0.4 ml/min per 1.73 m2/yr and not significantly dif￾ferent from 0 (p = 0.6785). Subgroup analyses were per￾formed to examine the impact of baseline proteinuria or
glomerulosclerosis on renal function during the study
period. The mean yearly decline in eGFR in patients (n
= 42) with low (< 1 g/24 h) proteinuria at baseline was
minimal [mean eGFR slope = -1.0 ml/min per 1.73 m2
/
yr (1.0; p = 0.3052)] (Figure 29) [309], and not statisti￾cally different from normal yearly reduction of GFR
[365]. Progressive Gb3 clearance from podocytes was
observed on kidney biopsies (n = 8) after 54 months of
ERT (Figure 30) [309].
Favorable renal outcomes in patients with less
impaired renal function have also been reported [334].
Patients with normal kidney function (GFR > 90 ml/
min/1.73 m2
) at baseline treated for a mean of 23
months showed stabilization of kidney function, whereas
patients with GFR < 90 ml/min/1.73 m2 had a
significant decrease in mean eGFR (from 71 to 60 ml/
min/1.73 m2
) [334].
Cardiac morphology and function Several research
groups have found reductions in LVH and amelioration
of LV stiffness and regional myocardial function in
patients with FD treated with agalsidase beta at 1 mg/kg
EOW. Significant improvement in LV hypertrophy and
function (both radial and longitudinal LV function) were
found in a strain rate imaging study in 16 adult patients
(mean age 42) treated for 1 year [91].
In another study, the effects of agalsidase beta (1 mg/
kg EOW) on cardiac morphology, function, and late
gadolinium enhancement were studied during 12
months of ERT. Only patients without late enhancement
(LE) at baseline had significant reductions in LVM dur￾ing ERT. No patients without late enhancement at base￾line developed LE during ERT. Echocardiography
revealed an improvement of regional myocardial func￾tion in patients without LE. In contrast, in patients with
LE at baseline, the amount of LE significantly increased
and the follow-up examinations showed neither regres￾sion of LVM nor improvement in regional myocardial
function [20].
In an open-label study, stabilization of mean LVM has
been demonstrated after 1 year of agalsidase beta treat￾ment at 1 mg/kg EOW in patients aged >30 years who
had significant degrees of baseline myocardial hypertro￾phy [335]. In contrast, neither resting or dipyridamole￾Figure 29 Median estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; ml/min per 1.73 m2) over time in 44 patients treated with agalsidase
beta for 54 months: Patients in the “as treated” population maintained a stable median eGFR during the 54-month treatment. Subgroup
analyses of patients who were stratified by baseline proteinuria (>1 g/24 h versus <1 g/24 h) showed differences in the rate of eGFR decline
during the 54-mo treatment period [309]. High (>1 g/24 h) baseline proteinuria was associated with higher rate of eGFR decline and increased
probability of renal events.

stimulated myocardial perfusion nor myocardial perfu￾sion reserve changed during ERT [335]. Self-estimated
cardiovascular condition, QoL, diastolic function, exer￾cise capacity, ECG parameters, ejection fraction and
ventricular mass did not change in an open-label pro￾spective follow-up study of 24-month ERT with agalsi￾dase beta at 1 mg/kg EOW in 5 male and 4 female
patients. ERT had only minimal effect on symptoms and
cardiovascular morphology and function [366].
In an open-label study on 11 patients (8 males and 3
females) a significant reduction in myocardial T2 relaxa￾tion times was noted in all myocardial regions on MRI,
(interventricular septum, apex, and lateral wall) after a
mean treatment duration of 45 months with agalsidase
beta at 1 mg/kg EOW [367].
Progression to major renal, cardiac, or cerebrovascu￾lar events, or death A multicentric, double-blind, ran￾domized, placebo-controlled phase IV study has shown
that agalsidase beta at 1 mg/kg EOW can slow the pro￾gression of the serious, life-threatening complications of
FD, even in patients who already have overt kidney dys￾function [325]. This study enrolled 82 patients (72
males, 10 females; aged 20-72 years) who were followed
for 18.5 months (median). The group of 51 patients ran￾domized to receive agalsidase beta treatment, overall,
had pronounced renal disease with a mean eGFR of 53
mL/min/1.73 m2 at baseline. A significant 61% reduction
of the risk of progression to major renal, cardiac, or cer￾ebrovascular events, or death, was found in treated
patients as compared to placebo-treated patients in the
per-protocol analysis that adjusted for an imbalance in
baseline proteinuria [hazard ratio, 0.39 (CI, 0.16 to
0.93); p = 0.034]. Greater and highly significant
treatment effects were seen in patients that had less
severe renal impairment at baseline (eGFR > 55 ml/min/
1.73 m2
) [325].
To date, it is not known if agalsidase beta therapy can
reduce or prevent the cerebrovascular complications
and hearing loss associated with FD [309,329]. In the
long-term extension study of the original pivotal trial,
five of 58 patients (9%) experienced symptomatic stroke
or transient ischemic attacks as an adverse event [309].
Whether a lower dose could maintain the Gb3 clear￾ance achieved with 1.0 mg/kg was explored in a study
where 21 adult male patients were treated with agalsi￾dase beta for 6 months at 1.0 mg/kg EOW followed by
18 months at 0.3 mg/kg/2 weeks. A lower dose of agalsi￾dase beta was sufficient in some, but not all, patients to
maintain the cellular Gb3 clearance achieved with 1.0
mg/kg/2 weeks. Long-term clinical effects of transition￾ing to the lower dose have not been evaluated [368].
C. Comparison between agalsidase alfa and agalsidase
beta treatments
Randomized controlled trials The results of the pub￾lished randomized controlled clinical trials and their
extension studies, together with the pediatric trials for the
two enzyme preparations, agalsidase alfa [324,326,327,342]
and agalsidase beta [309,323,329,359,362] are shown in
Table 5.
Head to head clinical trials The efficacy of and toler￾ability towards the two agalsidase preparations adminis￾tered at identical protein dose (0.2 mg/kg/14 days) were
compared in a randomized controlled open-label trial.
The study revealed no difference in reduction of LVM
or other disease parameters after 12 and 24 months of
treatment with either agalsidase alfa (Replagal®) or beta

(Fabrazyme®) at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg biweekly. Treat￾ment failure occurred frequently in both groups and
seemed related to age and severe pre-treatment disease
[336]. In another comparative study, the occurrence of
a-galactosidase A antibodies and their effect on urinary
and plasma Gb3, chitotriosidase and clinical outcome
were assessed in 52 patients after 12 months of treat￾ment with either 0.2 mg/kg agalsidase alpha (10 males,
8 females) or beta (8 males, 5 females) or 1.0 mg/kg
agalsidase beta (10 males, 11 females) [337]. Alpha￾galactosidase A antibodies frequently developped in
male patients (18/28) and interfered with urinary Gb3
excretion. From urinary Gb3 studies, it appears that per￾sistence of antibodies impairs ERT at a dose of 0.2 mg/
kg EOW. Infusion of a dose of 1.0 mg/kg resulted in a
more robust decline in Gb3, less impact of antibodies,
stable renal function and reduction of LVM [337]. Some
concerns have been expressed about the methodological
design and data interpretation of the later study [369].
An independent study of patients with FD in Canada,
aiming to compare the effects of agalsidase alfa, 0.2 mg/
kg/14 days, versus agalsidase beta, 1.0 mg/kg/14 days on
clinical outcomes is currently ongoing [370]. However,
interpretation of the study results will be meaningful
only if any imbalance between the agalsidase alfa and
agalsidase beta treated groups in terms of baseline para￾meters is corrected, and proper analysis of the data
accounts for confounding factors such as gender of
patients and nature of clinical events.
The supply of agalsidase beta has been reduced, since
June 2009, due to production problems. The supply
shortage of agalsidase beta resulted in some patients
either being switched to receiving agalsidase alfa or to
having a reduced dose of agalsidase beta. The potential
impact of IgG antibodies on the response to enzyme
replacement therapy in these patients remains unre￾solved [327,337,368,371,372]. Patients in whom the dose
or formulation of ERT has been amended will require
careful monitoring in order to assess impact on safety
and clinical efficacy [27] and help decision making when
supply of agalsidase beta is restored.
Kidney function The goal for treatment of Fabry
nephropathy is reduction in the rate of loss of GFR to
<-1.0 mL/min/1.73 m2
/year [77,373].
After 5 years of treatment with agalsidase alfa at the
dose recommended by the manufacturer (0.2 mg/kg
EOW), data reported in the FOS® database showed that
mean yearly fall in estimated GFR was - 2.83 mL/min/
1.73 m2 for male patients with chronic kidney disease
(CKD) stage 1 at baseline [333], statistically different (p
= 0.0001) from the normal yearly reduction of - 0.9 mL/
min/1.73 m2 [365]. The mean yearly loss of eGFR for
men with stage 2 disease at baseline was - 2.17 mL/
min/1.73 m2 (p = 0.0004). In male patients with stage 3
CKD at baseline, the mean yearly fall in eGFR after 5
years was - 3.0 ml/min/1.73 m2 (p = 0.006) [333,374]. In
contrast, corresponding values for men with CKD stage
1 or stage 2 disease and proteinuria < 1 g/day at base￾line treated for 5 years with agalsidase beta at 1 mg/kg
EOW (n = 42) were - 1.005 mL/min/1.73 m2
/year [309],
not statistically different (p= 0.3052) from normal yearly
reduction rate [365].
D. Practical considerations of ERT for Fabry disease
Infusion management During the pivotal, double-blind
trials of agalsidase alfa (Replagal®) [324] and agalsidase
beta (Fabrazyme®) [323], 57% (8/14) and 59% (34/58) of
patients experienced mild-to-moderate infusion-related
reactions, respectively, the incidence peaking around the
fifth to eighth infusion. Fevers, chills and rigors were the
only treatment-related adverse events occurring signifi￾cantly more frequently in the treatment group than in
the placebo group; all were transient, mild-to-moderate
in severity and were managed conservatively [323]. In
the follow-up study with agalsidase alfa, 13 of 25
patients experienced an infusion-reaction during or
shortly after one or more infusions. These reactions
typically consisted of facial flushing and rigors [327].
After 3 to 5 years of treatment, the number of patients
treated with agalsidase beta experiencing infusion reac￾tions fell to between 10 and 20%, suggesting that
patients develop tolerance to the infusions over time
[309,329].
The precise cause of the infusion-associated reactions
is unknown, but may be related to IgG antibodies speci￾fic to the infused enzyme (IgG seroconversion occurred
in 24% of agalsidase alfa treated-patients [339,340] and
in 51 of the 58 (88%) who received agalsidase beta dur￾ing double-blind [323] or open-label treatment [329]),
or to complement activation.
Experience gained in our center [375] suggests that
infusion-associated reactions (IAR) tend to occur during
the first 6 months of treatment - usually after 20-40
minutes of the infusion - and last for approximately 10-
30 minutes. The risk of events tends to increase with
increasing infusion rates. Based on these observations, it
is recommended that, at the first occurrence of an infu￾sion reaction, the patient’s temperature and vital signs
should be assessed and the infusion rate temporarily slo￾wed or stopped. In the case of a severe reaction, the
infusion must be stopped and the administration of anti￾histamines and/or corticosteroids should be considered.
The infusion can be continued in the case of mild reac￾tions, with close supervision. After cessation of or a
decrease in symptoms, the infusion may be re-started
and the infusion rate gradually increased to the original
rate. Subsequent infusions should be started at a lower
infusion rate and increased every 30 minutes. Pre-medi￾cation with an antihistamine, paracetamol and/or

Page 34 of 49

dexamethasone (1 hour before infusion) may also be
considered [295].
A few of the approximately 3000 patients treated to
date with agalsidase beta have developed plasma IgE
antibodies and a few others have had a positive prick￾test together with urticaria or skin rash (Figure 31).
Most patients have successfully undergone a rechallenge
protocol [376]. No IgE antibodies have been detected
during agalsidase alfa treatment [327]. Whether sero￾conversion affects treatment efficacy is currently
unknown but neutralizing antibodies to both agalsidase
alfa and agalsidase beta have been demonstrated [371]
and shown to lead to a relapse in urinary [327,336,377]
and cutaneous [372] Gb3. This warrants further studies
since in Gaucher disease [378], another lysosomal sto￾rage disorder due to the deficient activity of acid b￾glucosidase [379], neutralizing antibodies have been
shown to block the catalytic activity of the exogeneous
enzyme and lead to a deterioration of clinical course in
the very rare instances where they occur [380]. In these
cases, the potential use of immunosuppressive therapy
in combination with ERT should be investigated [381].
Infusion during dialysis and post transplant Many
physicians involved in treating patients with FD using
ERT have queried whether dialysis influences the phar￾macokinetics of the recombinant enzyme. Although
experience of infusing the enzyme during dialysis is cur￾rently limited, no problems have been encountered to
date. Virtually no difference in the plasma activity of
agalsidase beta was found regardless of whether or not
the infusion was given during hemodialysis [382]. The
procedure used a low-flux polysulphone filter, with
Figure 31 Skin rash during infusion of recombinant a-galactosidase A in a patient with positive IgE antibodies to agalsidase beta: In
year 2002, a 39-year-old male Fabry patient (GLA mutation p.Ala121Pro) was initially treated with agalsidase beta (1 mg/kg EOW). ERT was
changed to agalsidase alfa (0.2 mg/kg EOW) after 18 months due to poor tolerance (mild laryngeal edema, urticaria and chills during infusions).
Two years later, a rash appeared on both arms during agalsidase alfa infusions. In 2007, concomittant deterioration of kidney function on
agalsidase alfa (mGFR decreased from 85 to 70 mL/min/1.73 m2
) led to switch ERT back to agalsidase beta. No data was obtained with respect
to antibodies (IgG or IgE) to agalsidase alfa. After 1 year of agalsidase beta therapy, extensive skin rash and bronchospasm appeared during the
infusions despite premedication (hydroxyzine, paracetamol and oral steroids) and minimal infusion rates (0.05 - 0.2 mg/min) and kidney function
kept on deteriorating (mGFR = 54 mL/min/1.73 m2
). The patient tested positive for IgE to agalsidase beta and ERT was discontinued. Mutation p.
Ala121Pro is not responsive to the ASSC deoxygalactonojirymicin [424]. Both rechallenge protocol and concomitant use of immunosuppressive
therapy and ERT are currently being considered.

which there was no loss of enzyme. Theoretically,
enzyme adsorption to the filter could occur. A recom￾mendation, therefore, is to begin enzyme infusion
approximately 15 minutes after the start of dialysis, by
which time the membrane’s surface will be covered by
plasma proteins such as fibrinogen or albumin, reducing
the likelihood of enzyme adsorption to the membrane
and to the tubing system. The feasibility of infusing ERT
during dialysis confers a considerable practical advan￾tage to patients requiring dialysis [382].
Pregnancy Although ERT is theoretically contra-indi￾cated during pregnancy and lactation, both agalsidase
alfa [383,384] and agalsidase beta [385,386] have been
used in a limited number of cases. No adverse event
was reported and both recombinant enzymes appear
safe. However, few data are available and the decision to
initiate or maintain ERT during pregnancy should be
made on an individual basis and carefully monitored
[385].
Home therapy Home therapy can help to alleviate the
burden of intravenous infusions every 14 days for stable
patients who tolerate the infusions and have a suitable
home environment [387]. Several reports suggest that
patients appreciate home treatment and, if implemented
successfully, ERT can be administered in the home set￾ting in a safe and reliable manner [310,327,388]. This
should however not lead to decreased medical care and
patients should be referred to a tertiary center of excel￾lence every 6 to 12 months.
XII - Prognosis
With age, progressive damage to vital organ systems
develops and at some point, organs may start to fail in
functioning. End-stage renal disease and life-threatening
cardiovascular or cerebrovascular complications limit
life-expectancy of untreated males and females to
approximately 50 and 70 years, representing reductions
of 20 and 10 years, respectively, as compared to the gen￾eral population [25,26]. While it is hoped that long-term
enzyme therapy can halt disease progression, the impor￾tance of adjunctive therapies should be noted and the
possibility of developing an oral therapy drives forward
research into active site specific chaperones.
XIII - Current research
A. Basic research: cellular model of Fabry disease
In a recent study, a cell model of FD was established
[389]. The expression of a-galactosidase A was transi￾ently silenced by RNA interference in HK2 and primary
human renal epithelial cells and stably silenced in HK2
cells by retroviral transfection with small hairpin RNA
(shRNA). All of the silenced cells had reduced viability,
significant accumulation of intracellular Gb3, and a
modest but significant increase in membranous Gb3
(CD77) expression compared to non-silenced cells.
When silenced HK2 cells were reconstituted with agalsi￾dase alfa, they decreased their membranous CD77
expression to levels indistinguishable from those of non￾silenced cells. These data suggest that membranous
CD77 levels may mirror Gb3 tissue load and that CD77
expression levels may be used to monitor the efficacy of
ERT [390].
B. Basic research: animal models
Genetically authentic animal models of human lysoso￾mal diseases occur spontaneously in many mammalian
species. However, most are among larger domestic or
farm animals with only few well-defined genetic lysoso￾mal diseases known among rodents. This status changed
dramatically with the advent of the combined homolo￾gous recombination and embryonic stem cell technol￾ogy, which allows directed generation of mouse models
that are genetically equivalent to human diseases [391].
This technology has allowed generation of knock-out
mice for FD [392,393] as well as transgenic mice
[394,395]. These animal models have played an impor￾tant role in studies of the pathogenesis [15,396,397] and
treatments (including bone marrow transplant [398],
substrate deprivation [399], enzyme replacement therapy
[322,377,400], active site specific chaperones [401] and
gene therapy [402-407]) for FD. While the utility of
these mouse models is obvious, species differences in
metabolic pathways must always be remembered, if the
ultimate goal of the study is application to human
patients.
C. Clinical research: registries and outcome surveys
The Fabry Registry® [408] and the Fabry Outcome Sur￾vey® (FOS®) [409] are ongoing, observational databases
that compile clinical and laboratory data on patients
with FD. As of March 2010, the Fabry Registry® and
FOS® included 3200 and 1700 patients respectively. All
patients with FD are eligible for enrollment in the Fabry
Registry®, regardless of age, gender, symptoms, or
whether they are receiving ERT while enrollment in
FOS® is limited to patients treated with agalsidase alfa or
naïve to ERT. Patient and physician participation is
voluntary. All patients provide informed consent
through local institutional review boards/ethics commit￾tees and may decline to participate or withdraw consent
at any time. Treating physicians determine the actual
frequency of assessments according to patients’ indivi￾dualized needs. A schedule of recommended clinical
assessments is available in the Fabry Registry® [408].
Given the voluntary nature of reporting data, patients’
ages at clinical assessments and time intervals between
assessments are variable. Due to the rarity of the condi￾tion, clinical trials of ERT in FD generally involved rela￾tively small numbers of patients and much of the
available data on the natural history of the disease and

the long term safety and efficacy of the recombinant
enzymes available in the literature stems from the FOS®
[40,43,53,84,87,144,293,330,331,410] or the Fabry Regis￾try® [23,24,51,76,111,184,411,412].
XIV - Future perspectives
A. Use of a modified alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase in
the development of enzyme replacement therapy for Fabry
disease
The human lysosomal enzymes alpha-galactosidase (a￾gal A, EC 3.2.1.22) and alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase
(a-NAGAL, EC 3.2.1.49) share 46% amino acid
sequence identity and have similar folds. The active sites
of the two enzymes share 11 of 13 amino acids, differing
only where they interact with the 2-position of the sub￾strates. Using a rational protein engineering approach,
the enzymatic specificity of a-galactosidase A and a￾NAGAL were interconverted. The engineered a￾NAGAL [or a-NAGAL(EL)] retains the antigenicity of
a-NAGAL but has acquired the enzymatic specificity of
the a-galactosidase A enzyme. Comparison of the crys￾tal structures of the designed enzyme to the wild-type
enzymes shows that active sites of a-galactosidase A
and a-NAGAL superimpose well, indicating success of
the rational design. The designed enzymes might be use￾ful as non-immunogenic alternatives in ERT for treat￾ment of FD [413].
In another experiment, a modified alpha-N-acetylga￾lactosaminidase (NAGA or a-NAGAL, EC 3.2.1.49) with
a-galactosidase A-like substrate specificity was designed
on the basis of structural studies and was produced in
CHO cells. The enzyme acquired the ability to catalyze
the degradation of 4-MU-alpha-D-galactopyranoside.
There was no immunological cross-reactivity between
the modified NAGA and a-galactosidase A, and the
modified NAGA did not react to serum from a patient
with FD treated with recombinant a-galactosidase A.
The enzyme cleaved Gb3 accumulated in cultured fibro￾blasts from a patient with FD. Furthermore, like recom￾binant agalsidases currently used for ERT for FD, the
enzyme injected intravenously into FD model mice pre￾vented Gb3 storage in the liver, kidneys, and heart and
improved the pathological changes in these organs.
Because the modified NAGA is not expected to cause
an allergic reaction in patients with FD, it is promising
as a new and safe enzyme for ERT [414].
B. Active site specific chaperones
In FD, a significant number of disease-causing mutations
are missense mutations, which cause the newly synthe￾sized lysosomal protein to be unstable, but still catalyti￾cally competent [231,415]. Despite the fact that unstable
mutant a-galactosidases are catalytically comparable to
their wild type counterpart in their purified forms [204],
the newly synthesized enzymes are unable to undergo
trafficking to their appropriate location within the cell -
the lysosomal compartment (Figure 32). Studies of traf￾ficking and degradation of various mutant forms of a￾galactosidase A indicate that the mutant enzymes are
retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and degraded
by ER-associated degradation (ERAD) because of their
misfolded conformations [204]. This provides a rationale
for a therapeutic intervention using active-site-specific
chaperones to stabilize the conformation or reduce mis￾folding of the mutant protein in order to prevent the pre￾mature degradation by ERAD (Figure 32) [416-419].
Enzyme inhibitors from the imino-sugars family were
shown to be effective active-site-specific chaperones,
causing an increase in residual enzyme activity and sta￾bilizing enzyme activity in cultured lymphoblasts and
transfected COS-1 cells [420,421]. Subsequently, galac￾tose, a weak inhibitor of a-galactosidase A, was intrave￾nously infused to a male patient with the cardiac variant
of FD at a dose of 1 g/kg body weight every other day.
After 3 months of galactose infusions, the myocardial
fibres, which initially appeared severely hypertrophic
and extensively vacuolated were smaller, and vacuoliza￾tion was decreased [422].
The imino sugars are monosaccharide mimetics, char￾acterized by having a nitrogen atom in place of the ring
oxygen present in monosaccharides and often are potent
inhibitors of glycosidases. As the imino sugars have a
high affinity for the active site of the target enzyme,
they can also act as active-site-specific chaperones,
assisting protein folding or stabilizing misfolded
enzymes [423]. 1-Deoxygalactonojirymicin (DGJ), cur￾rently under investigation by the trade name of Amigal™
(migalastat hydrochloride; Amicus Therapeutics, Cran￾bury, NJ, USA), is a small imino sugar which mimics
the a-galactose of Gb3, the substrate for a-galactosidase
A, when it binds to the active site of the enzyme. The
firm binding between DGJ and the mutant enzyme shifts
the folding and stability of the enzyme in favor of the
appropriate and proper conformation, potentially per￾mitting a smooth escape from the ER for further
maturation and trafficking to the lysosomal compart￾ment [419] (Figure 32). DGJ may be effective only in
patients with specific, “responsive” GLA mutations cod￾ing for a mutant a-galactosidase with enhancable resi￾dual enzyme activity [419,424]. DGJ is an orally active,
small molecule drug which could provide additional
advantages of convenience and cost savings. However,
since DGJ is primarily an inhibitor of a-galactosidase A
activity, finding the right dosing and regimen for cha￾peroning is a key issue of this novel therapeutic
approach [419]. Phase II extension and phase III clinical
trials are ongoing.

Figure 32 Proposed mechanism of action of active site-specific chaperones (ASSCs): A: During synthesis of a wild-type lysosomal enzyme,
cells assemble amino acids in a correctly folded tertiary structure. Molecular chaperones are naturally occurring molecules that assist in protein
folding. B: In contrast, mutant misfolded lysosomal enzymes are unstable and retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where they may not
meet quality control and are prone to endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD). C: ASSCs are designed to stabilize and rescue
misfolded lysosomal enzymes, leading to reduced ER retention or accumulation, and enhanced trafficking to the Golgi apparatus and the
lysosome where they dissociate from the enzyme.
