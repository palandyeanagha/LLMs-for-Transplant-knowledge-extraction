Satellites: make data 
freely accessible
The cost of accessing satellite 
data is hampering the 
widespread application of 
satellite monitoring, a vital tool 
for controlling deforestation 
(Jim Lynch et al. Nature
496, 293–294; 2013) and for 
biodiversity assessments. We 
urge government agencies 
that produce taxpayer-funded 
satellite images to make these 
available free of charge and in 
user-friendly formats. 
Lynch and colleagues’ call for 
daily satellite observations of 
forests worldwide would mean 
aggregating information from 
numerous satellites that are 
operated by many countries. 
Assembling the large data sets 
needed for global monitoring 
would be prohibitively 
expensive, however, because 
national governments do not 
have a free-access policy for their 
satellite images. 
One solution would be to 
combine data from the US 
Landsat satellites with those 
from the European Space 
Agency’s planned Sentinel-2 
satellites, which could deliver 
optical imagery with global 
coverage every 3–5 days. The 
distribution of Landsat imagery 
has increased by two orders of 
magnitude since 2008, when the 
US Geological Survey made all 
the data free to access online. 
Data from NASA’s MODIS and 
all of their Earth-observation 
imagery are also available for 
free, as are data from the China–
Brazil Earth Resources Satellite 
programme.

Satellites: ambition 
for forest initiative
We disagree strongly with the 
suggestion by Jim Lynch and 
colleagues that the outputs of 
the Global Observation of Forest 
and Land Cover Dynamics 
panel and the Global Forest 
Observations Initiative “lack 
ambition and an understanding 
of the potential of satellites” 
(Nature 496, 293–294; 2013).
As participants in these 
programmes and in the United 
Nations Programme on Reducing 
Emissions from Deforestation and 
Forest Degradation (UN-REDD), 
we aim to show how remote 
sensing can help systematic global 
monitoring to make REDD+ a 
reality in the context of wider 
societal engagement. (REDD+ 
is a climate-mitigation initiative 
under the UN Framework 
Convention on Climate Change 
(UNFCCC).)
We also question the feasibility 
of Lynch and colleagues’ call 
for rapid-response satellite 
monitoring of deforestation to 
be enshrined in international 
law under the UNFCCC, given 
national sovereignty concerns 
and the fact that we are not yet in a 
position to mitigate the problems 
of cloud cover. Although 
radar can penetrate cloud, the 
technology cannot yet capture 
changes in forest ecosystems in a 
systematic and repeatable way.

Monster fern makes 
IUCN invader list
The list of 100 of the world’s 
worst invasive alien species, 
compiled by the International 
Union for Conservation of Nature 
(IUCN), aims to help biodiversity 
conservation efforts worldwide 
(see go.nature.com/qa9z1g). 
After a position on the list fell 
vacant as a result of the global 
eradication of the rinderpest virus 
(see, for example, Nature 474,
10–11; 2011), we coordinated the 
community of invasion biologists 
in a unique initiative to vote for a 
replacement.
We assessed more than 10,000 
invasive species from the world’s 
largest databases for their capacity 
to spread and for their potential 
ecological or economic impact. 
More than 650 experts from 
63 countries then voted on the ten 
candidate species we shortlisted, 
and selected the giant salvinia 
(Salvinia molesta), an aquatic fern.
Native to Brazil, this fern has 
spread throughout the tropics 
and subtropics. It doubles in 
abundance within days, forming 
thick, floating mats that block 
light from expanses of water, 
reduce its oxygen content and 
degrade water quality. They also 
impede water-based transport, 
clog irrigation and power￾generation systems, and harm 
local fisheries.
Now in the global spotlight, this 
new entrant to the IUCN list is set 
to increase public awareness of the 
harm caused by invasive species 
and to stimulate more discussion 
in science and policy circles.

Avoid more organ 
transplant scandals
Our institution is launching an 
international transdisciplinary 
initiative to improve the 
lamentable state of solid-organ 
transplantation in Germany and 
to help fulfil society’s obligations 
towards millions of organ donors 
and recipients worldwide (see 
go.nature.com/z5b7uo).
The mortality rate following 
liver transplantation has risen 
alarmingly across the country 
over the past few years. The 
survival rate after one year is 
only 72% in Germany, which is 
20% lower than in the United 
States and the United Kingdom, 
even though Germany has 
more transplant centres and 
fewer organ donors per capita 
(see go.nature.com/pgmrpn; 
in German). Such scandals are 
leading to a steady decline in 
altruistic organ donations, with 
an 18% drop in the first quarter of 
this year compared with the same 
period in 2012. 
The situation largely reflects 
the weak regulation of organ 
transplantation in Germany, 
especially by comparison with 
other countries such as the 
Netherlands and Denmark 
(C. Metz and N. Hoppe Eur. J. 
Health Law 20, 113–116; 2013). 
Proposals to rectify this include 
setting up an independent 
institute of transplantation 
medicine that has regulative 
and standard-setting powers 
(see go.nature.com/yzl4km; in 
German).
A lack of good prognostic 
models compounds the 
likelihood of transplantation 
failure. Such models would allow 
clinical urgency to be weighed 
against transplantation outcome. 
We are therefore planning 
systematic multicentre trials to 
evaluate the prognostic value of 
liver-allocation scores.
Our initiative also aims to 
address the dearth of quality￾management systems that 
are properly founded on 
comprehensive, evidence-based 
data and on precise methodology 
that considers patients’ needs and 
expectations.
The early results are 
promising. We intend to publish 
regular updates to provide 
essential information to the 
transplantation community and
