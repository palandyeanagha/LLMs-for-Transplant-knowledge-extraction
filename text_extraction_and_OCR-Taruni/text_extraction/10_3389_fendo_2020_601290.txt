The rising global prevalence of obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes has
driven a sharp increase in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), characterized by
excessive fat accumulation in the liver. Approximately one-sixth of the NAFLD population
progresses to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with liver inflammation, hepatocyte
injury and cell death, liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. NASH is one of the leading causes of liver
transplant, and an increasingly common cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC),
underscoring the need for intervention. The complex pathophysiology of NASH, and a
predicted prevalence of 3–5% of the adult population worldwide, has prompted drug
development programs aimed at multiple targets across all stages of the disease.
Currently, there are no approved therapeutics. Liver-related morbidity and mortality are
highest in more advanced fibrotic NASH, which has led to an early focus on anti-fibrotic
approaches to prevent progression to cirrhosis and HCC. Due to limited clinical efficacy,
anti-fibrotic approaches have been superseded by mechanisms that target the underlying
driver of NASH pathogenesis, namely steatosis, which drives hepatocyte injury and
downstream inflammation and fibrosis. Among this wave of therapeutic mechanisms
targeting the underlying pathogenesis of NASH, the hormone fibroblast growth factor 21
(FGF21) holds considerable promise; it decreases liver fat and hepatocyte injury while
suppressing inflammation and fibrosis across multiple preclinical studies. In this review,
we summarize preclinical and clinical data from studies with FGF21 and FGF21 analogs, in
the context of the pathophysiology of NASH and underlying metabolic diseases.

INTRODUCTION
A marked rise in the global prevalence of obesity and associated metabolic pathologies has been observed
over the past 30 years (1). The burden of managing a chronic excess of energy over demand falls on the
metabolic organs, including adipose tissue, pancreas, and liver. Ultimately the capacity of these organs to
manage the surfeit of energy is exceeded, manifesting as hyperlipidemia/dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, and
nonalcoholicfatty liver disease (NAFLD), defined as >5% liver fat content not attributable to other chronic
liver conditions.

Globally, more than 1 billion people are estimated to have
NAFLD, including 83 million patients in the United States, making
NAFLD the most common chronic liver disease in the US (2, 3).
Fifteen to twenty percent of patients with NAFLD progress to the
more severe nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (4), characterized
by hepatocyte stress, injury and apoptosis, inflammation and fibrosis
(5). Scarring of the liver (i.e., fibrosis) occurs in response to chronic
injury and inflammation. Left unaddressed, NASH fibrosis may
advance to cirrhosis, which in turn may cause end-stage liver
disease or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (6). The prevalence of
NASH, and in particular severe F3 and F4 fibrosis, is rapidly
increasing in the US and globally (7). By 2030, there are predicted
to be 27 million NASH patients in the US, including 3 million with
NASH cirrhosis (8). As fibrosis progresses, the risk of liver-related
morbidity and mortality increases (9). NASH-related liverfailure and
HCC have become leading causes of liver transplantation (10, 11),
particularly with the emergence of effective treatment for hepatitis C.
Besides the widely recognized morbidities, pre-cirrhotic NAFLD and
NASH also negatively impact health-related quality of life, further
underscoring the need for effective treatments (12).
NASH is diagnosed histologically, based on the extent of steatosis,
hepatocyte stress and damage (hepatocyte ballooning), immune
infiltration (lobular inflammation), and degree of fibrosis (13).
Within the liver, lipotoxicity-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
stress- and oxidative stress-induced tissue injury (14) release pro￾inflammatory damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that
recruit and activate Kupffer cells, liver-resident macrophages (15).
Kupffer cells amplify the cycle of necroinflammation (16)while directly
and indirectly activating hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) to differentiate
and proliferate to a myofibroblast-like, collagen-producing phenotype
that promotes fibrogenesis in NASH (17). Liver damage and ensuing
inflammation may also contribute, at a whole-body level, to metabolic
dysfunction in other organs and tissues (18). An ideal disease￾modifying therapeutic agent needs to target the primary driver of
NASH: elevated intrahepatocyte fat deposition. By removing the
underlying pathogenic insult, hepatocyte oxidative and ER stress and
lipotoxicity will diminish, resulting in less activation of pathways
driving hepatocyte dedifferentiation and death, in turn allowing the
downstream sequelae of liver inflammation and fibrosis to resolve.
While late-stage NASH greatly increases the risk of liver-related
morbidity, NAFLD and NASH with less advanced fibrosis (i.e., F0–
F2) are associated with greatly increased risk of cardiovascular disease
and related mortality (19). Indeed, the leading cause of death among
patients with NASH is cardiovascular disease, even after correcting
for the contribution of other known CV risk factors and metabolic
comorbidities (20–22). These highly prevalent metabolic
comorbidities, including hypertriglyceridemia (83% of NASH
patients), obesity (82%), dyslipidemia (72%), metabolic syndrome
(71%), and type 2 diabetes (44%), underscore the critical need to
holistically address the imbalanced metabolic state underlying
NASH (23).
Despite the unmet medical need, there is currently no
approved therapy for NASH. Lifestyle modifications, including
diet and exercise, that lead to significant weight loss have
demonstrated clinical benefit, but long-term compliance is
poor (24, 25). The first wave of therapeutic approaches in
NASH targeted downstream pathologies, specifically
necroinflammation and fibrosis, either inadequately addressing
or in some cases exacerbating the underlying drivers of NASH
pathology: steatosis, insulin resistance, and lipotoxicity. Among
numerous mid-to-late-stage failures across a variety of
mechanisms of action (26–29), the only positive interim phase 3
readout in the last decade has been a trial of the bile acid analog,
obeticholic acid (30), implying therapeutic target selection has been
suboptimal. Moreover, none of the therapeutics in development has
demonstrated both fibrosis improvement and resolution of NASH
in a phase 3 clinical study, the two histological endpoints accepted
by the FDA and EMA as sufficient to support accelerated
or expedited regulatory approval. While the shift to address the
underlying drivers of NASH holds promise, many of the
mechanisms under investigation are limited to the liver as their
site of action, because of safety constraints arising from systemic
exposure (Table 1). As a consequence, these mechanisms have not
improved whole-body metabolism, and in some cases have been
associated with adverse effects such as increases in serum low￾density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (30–32), serum triglycerides
(33, 34), and body weight (35, 36).
On the other hand, endocrine fibroblast growth factor (FGF)
analogs have emerged as a promising class because of their ability to
not only act directly on liver, but also to shift whole-body metabolism
to a healthier state. The FGF19 subfamily of FGFs, consisting of
FGF19, FGF21, and FGF23, is characterized by reduced affinity for
heparan sulfate (HS) (37). In the absence of HS binding, these FGFs
may diffusefrom their site of secretion, enabling endocrine actions via
the systemic circulation, as well as canonical FGF paracrine signaling
on their cell of origin or nearby cells (38).Whereas HS in extracellular
matrix serves as a coreceptor for autocrine and paracrine FGFs, the
endocrine FGFs rely on high-affinity interactions with either a￾Klotho (FGF23) or b-Klotho (FGF19 and FGF21) for recruitment
and localization to the cell surface, where they engage canonical FGF

receptors (FGFRs) (39–42). Dysregulation of endocrine FGF
signaling, particularly FGF19 and FGF21, has been implicated in
metabolic disease, suggesting their potential as therapeutic
mechanisms (43–46). While gut-secreted FGF19 and liver-secreted
FGF21 (47) share some overlapping physiological roles, including
regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism (48), significant
differences exists between them, primarily in the ability of FGF19
to stimulate hepatocyte proliferation and to suppress bile acid
synthesis (49). These divergent actions result from different agonist
profiles across the FGFRs: whereas the FGF19/b-Klotho receptor
complex is able to bind and activate FGFR1c, FGFR2c, FGFR3c, and
FGFR4, the FGF21/b-Klotho complex signals only through FGFR1c,
FGFR2c, and FGFR3c (41).
This review examines the unique physiology of FGF21 signaling
at the cellular, tissue, and whole-body level, presenting preclinical
and clinical evidence that FGF21-based therapeutics exert a broad
set of metabolic actions and also suppress inflammation and
fibrosis. In particular, the discussion focuses on the promise of
FGF21 analogs as foundational treatments for NASH.
METABOLIC DYSREGULATION
UNDERLYING EARLY STEATOHEPATITIS
PATHOLOGY
Insulin resistance, obesity, and dyslipidemia are the clinical
manifestations of a chronic excess of energy. To reduce energy
uptake, peripheral organs including adipose tissue and skeletal
muscle respond by reducing sensitivity to insulin. As a result,
dietary energy is diverted to the liver, leading to excessive
accumulation of lipid droplets (LD) in hepatocytes (hepatic fat
fraction of up to 20–30%, vs <5% in healthy liver) (5), and
hyperlipidemia (50). In NASH patients, the sources of hepatic fatty
acid flux are presented in Figure 1A: 45–55% is accounted for by
adipose tissue lipolysis; 25–35% by de novo lipogenesis (DNL) in the
liver; and 10–20% by dietary fat (51, 52). Impaired peripheral insulin
sensitivity (52) contributes substantially to the increased flux offatty
acid in liver. Post prandial suppression of adipose tissue lipolysis by
insulinisimpaired (48),while uptake by adipose tissue of dietaryfat as
chylomicrons is also attenuated. Insulin-dependent glucose uptake
by adipose tissue and skeletal muscle is likewise reduced, redirecting
glucose to the liver where it fuels DNL by activating the carbohydrate
response element-binding protein (ChREBP), a master
transcriptional regulator of lipogenic pathway proteins (53).
ChREBP is also induced in liver by dietary fructose, a major source
of calories in “Western” obesogenic diets (54, 55). Increased
esterification of fatty acid by liver is associated with higher secretion
of triglyceride into the circulation as VLDL. Accumulation of fat in
the circulation manifests as elevated serum triglyceride and LDL￾cholesterol, in combination with low levels of high-density
lipoprotein (HDL), characteristic of the dyslipidemia prevalent in
NASH patients (56).
Chronic accumulation of triglyceride in liver elevates the
basal rate of fatty acid b-oxidation in hepatocytes. Conditions

NASH, which increases both liver-related mortality and cardiovascular mortality. (B) Increased intrahepatic fat drives pathophysiological processes across the
hepatocyte, inflammatory Kupffer cell, and collagen-producing hepatic stellate cell. Ultimately, continuous exposure to the underlying stressors (metabolic
dysregulation, lipotoxicity) sustain the inflammatory and fibrotic phenotype leading to progressive fibrosis and cirrhosis.

in which energy supply from fat oxidation exceeds energy
demand lead to formation of reactive oxygen species, in turn
causing oxidative stress (57, 58). This stress, which damages
hepatocytes, also induces transcription and secretion of FGF21,
which appears able to act directly on hepatocytes as a paracrine
or autocrine hormone (59, 60).
Preclinical characterization of FGF21 in rodents and primates
has established its role in restoring metabolic homeostasis in
obese or metabolically challenged animals, reducing body weight,
liver and circulating triglycerides, fasting plasma insulin and
glucose, and increasing energy expenditure (43, 61). Consistent
with a protective role, endogenous FGF21 serum concentration
may be elevated by up to 10–20-fold in patients with NAFLD (62,
63), NASH (64), obesity (64–66), type 2 diabetes (67), chronic
kidney disease (68), diabetic nephropathy (69), atherosclerosis
(70, 71), or coronary heart disease (72). However, this elevation
of FGF21 observed in chronic, pathological metabolic states in
humans does not appear sufficient to ameliorate disease.
While decreased FGF21 receptor expression has been
proposed to underlie this “FGF21-resistant state,” (73), the
dramatic upregulation of fibroblast activation protein (FAP),
an endopeptidase that cleaves and inactivates endogenous
FGF21 (74), has been reported in liver and serum of patients
with metabolic liver disease (75–77). Together, these
observations have guided the design and development of
FGF21 analogs that may restore metabolic homeostasis. The
physiology and dysregulation of FGF21 signaling in NASH is
discussed in detail below, particularly in the context of FGF21
resolving discrete aspects of NASH pathology.
FIBROBLAST GROWTH FACTOR 21
PHYSIOLOGY
FGF21 relies on its obligate co-receptor, b-Klotho, for recruitment
to the extracellular surface of plasma membrane (78). The b￾Klotho/FGF21 receptor complex interacts specifically with the
cognate receptors: FGFR1c, FGFR2c, or FGFR3c (40, 41),
enabling downstream FGFR signaling via pathways including the
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and AKT signaling
networks (79).
Endocrine Role of Fibroblast Growth
Factor 21 Physiology
Because FGF21 enters the systemic circulation, it is able to integrate
metabolism across liver, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, pancreas,
and other metabolic organs (Figure 2), by controlling expression of
transcriptional programs that shape cellular phenotype and tissue
metabolic function, ultimately exerting anti-obesity, anti-diabetic,
and anti-hyperlipidemic effects in rodents and primates (43, 44).
Expression of FGF21 is regulated by metabolic cues. Changes in
organismal nutritional state, such as those induced by fasting or
starvation (80), high-carbohydrate diets (81, 82) or low-protein diets
FIGURE 2 | Predicted effects of FGF21 signaling in different human tissues and cell types in vivo. FGF21 binds -Klotho on the cell surface, enabling interaction of the
ligand/receptor complex with the FGFR isoform present on that cell type. FGF21 signaling appears to be primarily mediated by FGFR1c in adipose tissue, FGFR2c in
liver, and FGFR1c or FGFR3c in pancreas. The contribution of FGFR1c signaling in the brain to the metabolic effects of FGF21 in humans remains to be elucidated.

(83–86) activate FGF21 expression. These diverse states activate
transcription from the FGF21 locus via well-characterized
nutritional and metabolite-responsive transcription factors,
including fatty acid-responsive nuclear hormone receptors
peroxisome proliferator-actived receptor- (PPAR)a and PPARg
(87–92), and the glucose and lipid homeostasis-controlling
transcription factor CREBH (93, 94).
FGF21 appears to be mainly synthesized in the liver (95), with
dynamic contributions from the pancreas, adipose tissue, and
skeletal muscle (96). The target tissues of FGF21’s endocrine
actions are determined by overlapping tissue expression patterns
for b-Klotho and cognate FGFRs.
In mice, b-Klotho is primarily expressed across metabolic
tissues including liver, pancreas, and adipose tissue (96, 97).
FGFR1c is much more highly expressed than other FGFR
isoforms in adipose tissue and pancreas (41, 73, 96, 98, 99).
FGFR2c is more highly expressed than FGFR1c or FGFR3c in
liver (96, 100). FGFR2c and KLB (the gene encoding b-Klotho) are
induced upon exposure to FGF21 or an FGF21 analog, consistent
with enhanced sensitivity to FGF21’s metabolic effects (101).
In humans, FGFR1c is also the predominantly expressed
receptor in adipose tissue, with mRNA levels up to two orders of
magnitude higher than for FGFR2c or FGFR3c (99, 102). FGF21,
FGFR1c, FGFR2c, and FGFR3c are also expressed in skeletal muscle
(103, 104). FGFR2c and, to a lesser extent, FGFR3c are expressed
basally in liver (102), and FGFR2c is more highly expressed in
NAFLD relative to healthy liver (99). Obesity increases expression
of FGF21, KLB, FGFR1c, and FGFR3cin the liver, although FGFR2c
remains the most highly expressed of FGF21’s receptors in the liver.
In contrast, obesity reduces the expression of KLB in subcutaneous
and visceral adipose tissue (102).
As an endocrine factor, FGF21 has been shown in preclinical
models to exert effects in diverse tissues beyond liver, including
adipose tissue, pancreas, skeletal muscle, and the central nervous
system. These diverse extrahepatic actions provide broad
metabolic benefits and help to resolve hepatic steatosis in
patients with NASH. In particular, agonism of FGFR1c appears
essential to mediating FGF21’s suppression offatty acid flux from
adipose tissue to liver. On the other hand, direct modulation of
metabolism and mediation of FGF21’s cytoprotective effects in
liver, described below, likely requires agonism of FGFR2c and
possibly FGFR3c. Consequently, analogs of FGF21 designed for
treating NASH should posess balanced agonism across FGFR1c,
FGFR2c, and FGFR3c.
Integration of Endocrine Actions With
Other Hormones
The interaction of FGF21 with other hormones that regulate
metabolism is complex. On one hand, FGF21 appears to increase
peripheral anabolic signaling, for example through muscle and
adipose tissue insulin sensitization, under conditions of adequate or
excessive energy intake, as described in detail below. On the other
hand, FGF21 appears to augment catabolic hormone signalling under
conditions of inadequate energy intake, for example by increasing
adrenal gland sensitivity to adrenocorticotropic hormone by
upregulating levels of steroidogenic proteins (105). FGF21 also
appears to mediate some of the effects of hepatic glucagon and
thyroid hormone signaling, since both activation of glucagon
receptor (GCGR) (106) and thyroid hormone receptor-b (TR-b)
(107) induce secretion of FGF21 by hepatocytes. The cooperative
interaction between FGF21, glucagon and thyroid hormonewould be
expected to increase glucose output and oxidation offat by liver (108,
109). In the setting of NASH, increasing liver fat oxidation should
help reduce steatosis, while exporting energyfrom the liver as glucose
aids in unburdening the liver of excess energy. Simultaneously, the
released glucose is taken up more effectively by peripheral organs due
to FGF21-enhanced insulin sensitivity, described in detail below.
Autocrine/Paracrine Role of Fibroblast
Growth Factor 21 Physiology
Expression and secretion of FGF21 is activated in many cell types
experiencing ER stress and oxidative stress. FGF21 induces a
number of pathways that serve to protect cells against these
stressors, while simultaneously inhibiting pro-cell death
pathways. Mitochondrial dysfunction leading to oxidative stress
also induces FGF21 expression in preclinical disease models (110),
while levels of FGF21 are elevated in the circulation and skeletal
muscle of patients with myopathies caused by mutations in
components of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
machinery (111).
Enhanced secretory load, imbalances in redox homeostasis, or
perturbations in protein homeostasis triggered by lysosomal or
autophagosomal dysfunction may all cause ER stress and trigger
the unfolded protein response (UPR). Across multiple tissues,
FGF21 appears to counteract ER stress (101, 112, 113).
POTENTIAL OF FIBROBLAST GROWTH
FACTOR 21 PHYSIOLOGY AS A THERAPY
FOR NON-ALCOHOLIC
STEATOHEPATITIS
Steatosis and Lipotoxicity in Non￾Alcoholic Steatohepatitis
Steatosis in hepatocytes is characterized microscopically by
accumulation of triglyceride in numerous cytosolic LDs. Recent
studies of human genetic associationswithNAFLD and NASH have
confirmed the central role of aberrant LD biology in disease
etiology. Three risk alleles uncovered in genome-wide association
studies on NASH patients include polymorphisms in the LD￾associated genes HSD17B13 (114), PNPLA3 (115), and TM6SF2
(116). These risk alleles correlate with increased rates of liver injury,
fibrosis, HCC, and liver-related mortality. How these genotypes
influence LD homeostasis is the subject of considerable ongoing
research. The pathogenic variant of TM6SF2 increases the risk and
severity of NASH but reduces cardiovascular disease, seemingly by
reducing triglyceride secretion from the liver as VLDL (117).While
accumulation of esterified triglyceride in hepatocyte LDs are not
directly lipotoxic, their constant turnover releases lipotoxic species
including fatty acids, diacylglycerol, free cholesterol and ceramide
(118–120). Saturated fatty acids liberated from LDs, or taken up
from circulation into the liver, may directly promote tissue injury,
leading to additional macrophage recruitment and activation (121).
Tillman and Rolph Rationale for FGF21-Based NASH Therapies
Frontiers in Endocrinology | www.frontiersin.org December 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 601290 5

Unesterified fatty acids also destabilize lysosomes leading to
activation of NF-kB-dependent tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a)
expression which potentiates lipotoxicity-driven inflammation
(122). Palmitate, a major saturated fatty acid, has also been
reported to contribute directly and indirectly to proteotoxic stress
and ER stress (123). Unsaturated fatty acids under conditions of
oxidative stressform highly reactive epoxides resulting information
of protein adducts (124), which also increase ER stress (125).
Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 Reduces Hepatic
Steatosis and Lipotoxicity
Administration of FGF21, FGF21 analogs or adenoviral delivery of
FGF21 reduces hepatic steatosis in diverse rodent models of NAFLD
and NASH (101, 126–129). The reduction in liver fat results from
pleiotropic actions of FGF21, particularly suppressing caloric burden
in the liver, reducing de novo lipogenesis, and increasingfat oxidation
in the liver. In diet-induced obese (101, 129) or non-obese (130)mice,
FGF21 or an FGF21 analog reduces expression of lipogenic genes,
including SCD1, FASN, and/or SREBF1, a master regulator of the
lipogenic transcriptional network that is overexpressed on a high-fat
diet. The reduction in lipogenic gene expression appears attributable
to bothweight loss andmechanisms independent ofweight loss, since
a similar magnitude of weight loss induced by a low-calorie diet
elicited a smaller reduction in lipogenic gene expression than FGF21
(101). Conversely, an FGF21 analog increases expression of genes
involved in mitochondrial b-oxidation of fatty acids (131). The
reduction in hepatic steatosis by FGF21 is independent of AMPK￾dependent inhibition of acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC) (132).
Oxidative and Endoplasmic Reticulum
Stress in Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis
Another of the genetic variants associated strongly with NASH, the
I148M variant of patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing
protein 3 (PNPLA3) appears to disrupt release of mono￾unsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), which activate peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-a (PGC1a)
and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2). These
transcription factors mediate increases in fatty acid oxidation
capacity and pathways protective against oxidative stress (86–88).
NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4), a ROS-producing enzyme, is highly
expressed in the livers of NASH patients and contributes to
pathological inflammation and fibrosis in a mouse model of diet￾induced NASH (94). Chronic oxidative stress may exacerbate LD
accumulation as a means to regenerate NAD from NADH under
conditions of excess energy supply (Figure 1B), as observed in
cultured mouse hepatocytes in which expression of fatty acid
synthase (FASN) and sterol response element-binding protein 1c
(SREBF1) are induced (133). Moreover in vivo knockout of genes
encoding antioxidant enzymes SOD1 or GPX1 induces hepatic
expression of SREBP1c and SREBP2, and increases liver triglyceride
content by over 50% (134).
An increase in oxidative species and altered redox leads to an
accumulation of misfolded or damaged proteins and in turn ER
stress (135). In healthy hepatocytes, autophagy degrades
damaged proteins, but this pathway appears disrupted in liver
of patients with NAFLD (98). Stabilization and activation of
mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) by acetyl
CoA, the product of fatty acid oxidation, may contribute to
disruption of autophagy (136).
The UPR has three canonical branches (PERK/ATF4, IRE1a/
XBP1, and ATF6), which play a central role in mitigating cellular
stress by enhancing protein folding capacity and secretion,
activating the oxidative stress response, and inducing autophagy,
thereby restoring protein homeostasis (137). In preclinical studies,
UPR dysregulation contributes to oxidative damage and hepatocyte
death in a mouse model of fructose-induced NAFLD (138). UPR
function also appears compromised in maintaining redox balance
within hepatocytes in NAFLD and NASH patients (139). Two
branches of the UPR appear, at least in part, to suppress steatosis in
animal models (140). Loss of either the ATF6 or the IRE1a
pathways sensitizes animals to ER stress-induced liver steatosis,
metabolic dysregulation and mortality (140). Ablation of either of
these branches increases hepatic lipogenic gene expression and
steatosis while leading to unresolved ER stress, characterized by
sustained UPR activation and, in particular, elevated ATF4/CHOP
signaling. One potential mechanism underlying this steatosis may
be upregulation of hepatic VLDL receptor expression by PERK/
eIF2a signaling, thereby enhancing hepatocyte triglyceride uptake
(141). In addition to contributing to the steatotic drive associated
with sustained UPR signaling (140), CHOP mediates the pro￾apoptotic effects of the UPR in the post-adaptive phase (137).
Unresolved lipotoxicity, oxidative stress, and ER stress
ultimately trigger apoptosis of hepatocytes (Figure 1B).
Apoptotic cell death is observed both in liver and in peripheral
tissues in NAFLD patients (142, 143). CHOP drives hepatocyte
apoptosis in part via transcriptional regulation of autophagy (144).
Toxic lipids may themselves stimulate apoptosis via IRE1a￾dependent activation of the pro-apoptotic c-Jun N-terminal
kinase, JNK1, a MAPK (145). Intracellular free cholesterol levels,
which trigger apoptosis of hepatocytes in a JNK1-dependent
manner, are elevated in NAFLD patients, correlating with degree
of histological disease activity (146). Pro-apoptotic signaling of
JNK1 is mediated by the upstream MAP3K apoptosis signal￾regulating kinase (ASK1) cascade (147). Apoptotic and lipo￾apoptotic cell death is dependent on mitochondrial disruption by
pro-apoptotic mediators (e.g., BAX, BAD, etc) that in turn release
molecules that activate caspase-mediated degradation and cell
death. Upon cell death, hepatocytes release DAMPs, the
degradation products of endogenous subcellular structures and
proteins that recruit and activate Kupffer cells, thereby initiating
and progressing inflammatory liver disease (148).
Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 Reduces Oxidative
Stress and Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress
Expression and secretion of FGF21 is induced by oxidative stress. For
example, blocking hepatic oxidation of long-chain fatty acids induces
oxidative stress and expression of FGF21 (149). Furthermore, acute
oxidative stress induced by acetaminophen markedly upregulates
expression of FGF21, b-Klotho and antioxidant enzymes in
hepatocytes (150). Acting as an autocrine agent, FGF21 activates
pathways that protect against oxidative stress. Consistent with potent
antioxidant effects in liver, FGF21 protects mouse liver from
acetaminophen-induced oxidative damage (150). In wild-type
mice, FGF21 treatment increases hepatic transcription of the

canonical oxidative stress response and antioxidant genes Sod2
(superoxide dismutase 2), Cat (catalase), Gpx1 (glutathione
peroxidase 1), Sirt1 (sirtuin), and Foxo3 (forkhead box
transcription factor 3) (151). In liver of obese diabetic mice, FGF21
reduces oxidative damage and lipid peroxidation (152).
FGF21 is also induced by the UPR. In diet-induced obese mice
and in NAFLD patients, activation of all three branches of the
UPR is observed, with increased nuclear ATF4, ATF6, and XBP1
protein levels along with increased whole-lysate phosphorylated
eIF2a, phosphorylated IRE1a, and FGF21 (153). In mice, this
induction of FGF21 expression requires IRE1-XBP1 signaling.
Acting as an autocrine or paracrine hormone, FGF21 appears
both to induce pathways that restore protein homeostasis, for
example by enhancing TFEB-dependent lysosomal biogenesis to
enable turnover of damaged proteins (154, 155); and also to act as
a negative feedback loop to suppress chronic activation of the
ATF4/CHOP-mediated, pro-steatotic and pro-apoptotic pathway.
The eIF2a/PERK/ATF4 branch of the UPR also activates FGF21
under different conditions of ER stress, including change in ER
redox state upon dithiothreitol treatment, or perturbation of ER
calcium homeostasis with thapsigargin (156). Because lipid
accumulation, lipotoxicity, oxidative stress, and ER stress all
appear to be fundamental drivers of NASH pathogenesis,
FGF21-based therapies may be broadly useful in a potentially
heterogeneous NASH patient population.
Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 Reprograms Hepatocyte
Gene Expression
FGF21 signaling in hepatocytes may promote epigenetic
reprogramming to a healthier metabolic phenotype. In mice,
fasting-induced FGF21 signaling leads to PKA-dependent
recruitment of a histone demethylase, JMJD3, to the promoters of
autophagy genes (157). JMJD3 demethylation of these promoters
de-represses target autophagy genes, which in turn restores
functional autophagy and lipid catabolism in obese animals. In
fibrotic and cirrhotic liver tissue from patients with NASH (158,
159), reduced expression of HNF4a, a master regulator of mature
hepatocyte cell fate, has been observed. In high-fat diet-induced
obese mice, FGF21 treatment increases hepatocyte HNF4a by a
weight loss-independent mechanism (101). Moreover, transgenic
overexpression of FGF21 rescues rats from liver failure by restoring
a mature hepatocyte transcriptional profile to dedifferentiated
hepatocytes, in turn improving their function (160).
Inflammation and Inflammatory Signaling
in Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis
Liver resident macrophages, known as Kupffer cells, are activated by
DAMPs and pro-inflammatory cytokines released by stressed and
apoptotic hepatocytes (15). DAMPs bind and activate pattern
recognition receptors (PRRs) on Kupffer cells, including Toll-like
receptor 4 (TLR4), which is upregulated in NASH livers, leading to
nuclear translocation of a master transcriptional regulator of
inflammation, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of
activated B cells (NF-kB) (161). Mitochondrial DNA released from
damaged or dying hepatocytes also activates Kupffer cells via TLR9
receptors (117). Transcription of NF-kB target genes activates
Kupffer cells, leading to secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines
and chemokines including TNFa (162), IL-1b (163), IL-6 (164),
monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1)/CCL2 (165), and C￾X-C motif chemokine ligand-10 CXCL10 (166). These signals serve
to recruitmonocyte-derived macrophages, neutrophils, and T-helper
cells (Th1 and Th17) to the inflammatory niche (167, 168). The
resulting, locally elevated concentration of pro-inflammatory
molecules directly causes hepatocyte injury and apoptosis, for
example via TNFa-mediated death receptor activation (169),
initiating and perpetuating a “vicious cycle” of necroinflammation
leading to loss of hepatocytes and of the liver’s functional
capacity (170).
In addition to release of PRR ligands, hepatocyte stress and
death are associated with release of pro-inflammatory cytokines,
including inflammasome-mediated interleukin-1b (IL-1b), which
further contributes to NASH-associated hepatitis (171).
Components of the NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing
protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome are more highly expressed in
liver samples from NASH patients than those without NASH (172).
The NLRP3 inflammasome cleaves and activates caspase 1, which
not only activates IL-1b but also IL-18 (171). Inmice, inactivation of
NLRP3 or inflammasome signaling suppresses inflammation and
fibrosis in models of NASH (173, 174) and alcoholic steatohepatitis
(175) by reducing recruitment and activation of Kupffer cells (174).
NLRP3 activation in hepatocytes can also lead to caspase 1-
mediated pyroptosis, or inflammasome-mediated lytic cell death,
amplifying the release of DAMPs beyond just apoptotis-associated
DAMP release (176).
Fibroblast Growth Factor-21 Exerts Direct Anti￾Inflammatory Effects
FGF21 suppresses inflammation in NASH models, as well as in
models of other inflammatory diseases. Consistent with a direct
anti-inflammatory effect in multiple cell types, FGF21 inhibits
macrophage expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines
TNFa, IL-6, IL-1b, and IFN-g by inducing NRF2 nuclear
translocation, thereby blocking NF-kB activation (177). FGF21
also reduces fatty acid-induced hepatocyte expression of TNFa
and the NF-kB subunit p65, and LPS-induced hepatocyte
expression of IL-6 in vitro (178). The broad anti-inflammatory
effects of FGF21 have also been demonstrated in cell-based
models of inflammatory cytokine secretion by pulmonary
endothelial cells (179) and human lung cells (180).
These same inflammatory pathways are suppressed in vivo upon
FGF21 administration in animal models of NASH and other
metabolic diseases. In obese diabetic mice with elevated
inflammatory signaling in liver, administration of an FGF21 analog
reduces hepatic activation of NF-kB and JNK1/2, inhibiting TNFa
expression and consequent macrophage recruitment (152).
Conversely, loss of FGF21 increases both liver and plasma cytokine
levels in mice, including TNFa, IL-6, and MCP-1, upon chronic
alcohol exposure (181). Loss of FGF21 also potentiates fructose￾induced hepatic expression of theinflammatory genesMCP-1/CCL2,
MIP1a/CCL3, and CD68, suggesting that FGF21 maintains liver
health during chronic fructose exposure (182). In liver tissue of high￾fat diet-induced obese mice, FGF21 treatment augments expression
of the immunosuppressive gene IKBKEand reduces expression of the
pro-inflammatory gene IL-18, independent of FGF21-induced
Tillman and Rolph Rationale for FGF21-Based NASH Therapies

weight loss (101). Additionally, an FGF21 analog reduces expression
of pro-inflammatory and increases expression of anti-inflammatory
genes in non-human primate adipose tissue (183). Finally, FGF21
reduces expression and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in
vascular endothelial cells in diabetic mice (184), which both protects
the cells themselves and reduces further inflammatory damage by
suppressing pyroptosis and immune cell recruitment (185).
Consistent with its suppression of pro-inflammatory gene
expression, FGF21 inhibits immune cell recruitment and
activation in vivo. An FGF21 analog reduces neutrophil and
macrophage infiltration in the liver of obese non-human
primates with NAFLD (186). Adenovirus-mediated long-term
overexpression of FGF21 in high-fat diet-induced obese mice
suppresses hepatic and adipose inflammatory cell infiltration and
activation (187). FGF21 also indirectly suppresses recruitment of
CD4+ Th17 cells and secretion of IL-17 in a choline-deficient,
high-fat diet model of NASH, by enhancing adiponectin release
from adipose tissue (128). Consistent with suppression of the
Th17/IL-17 axis in NASH models, FGF21 reduces the expression
of IL-17 and the expansion of Th17 cells in a mouse model of
rheumatoid arthritis (188). FGF21 significantly suppresses
immune infiltration and inflammatory gene expression in
cerulein-induced pancreatitis in mice (189), protects against
high-fat diet-induced pancreatic lymphocytic inflammation
and islet dysfunction (190), and reduces macrophage
infiltration in murine pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (191).
In summary, FGF21’s anti-inflammatory actions likely arise
from both direct suppression of proinflammatory signalling, by
innate and possibly adaptive immune cell types as well as
attenuation of immune-effector cell infiltration into the liver, and
its indirect inhibition of pro-inflammatory signals released by
injured hepatocytes. Because inflammation is a core component
and driver of NASH pathology, the anti-inflammatory actions of
FGF21-based therapies are likely to benefit the general NASH
patient population.
Fibrosis in Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis
In addition to exacerbating hepatocyte injury and apoptosis,
activation of Kupffer cells and expansion of the inflammatory niche
stimulates differentiation of liver-resident HSCs into pro-fibrogenic
myofibroblasts (192) (Figure 1B). In particular, hepatocyte- or
Kupffer cell-derived TGF-b, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)
and TNFa stimulate and sustain proliferation and differentiation of
HSCs. HSC activation initially promotes wound healing and liver
regeneration (193), including elevated production of type I and type
III collagen, as well as proteases and cytokines that drive remodeling
of extracellular matrix (ECM). However, chronic inflammation
sustains this fibrogenic signaling in the HSC niche, leading to
progressive liver fibrosis and ultimately cirrhosis (193–196). HSCs
are also activated by increased attachment to the ECM, mediated by
integrin/focal adhesion kinase signaling, suggesting a self-sustaining
program of collagen deposition and HSC activation (197). By
secreting inflammatory cytokines and cell adhesion molecules
(198), activated HSCs in turn further amplify and perpetuate the
inflammatory cycle by promoting macrophage activation
and infiltration.
Inflammation is not the only pathogenic mechanism underlying
fibrosis in livers of NASH patients, as dysregulation of a number of
developmental and metabolic pathways also contributes to fibrosis
(199). Notch ligands NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 and their
corresponding receptors are upregulated in liver of patients with
type 2 diabetes or NASH (200) compared to those without (201).
Hepatocytes in particular demonstrate marked upregulation of the
canonical Notch target gene, HES1, compared to nonparenchymal
cells, correlating with disease severity (132). In a mouse model of
diet-induced NASH, Notch signaling in hepatocytes induces
osteopontin secretion, paracrine HSC activation and hepatic
fibrosis, which are abrogated by Notch inhibition (132). Like
Notch signaling components, levels of osteopontin protein and
gene expression are positively correlated with NAFLD disease
severity and extent of fibrosis (202).
Hepatocyte triglyceride accumulation and cholesterol
dysregulation also directly drive HSC activation via induction
of the Hippo pathway (146, 199). Marked upregulation of the
Hippo pathway transcriptional activator, TAZ, is evident in liver
samples from NASH patients, but not from patients with simple
steatosis (149). Elevated levels of hepatocyte free cholesterol in
NASH (203) stabilize TAZ, which is constitutively degraded
(204). Stabilized TAZ directly activates transcription of the
Hedgehog pathway ligand, Indian Hedgehog (IHH), which is
secreted from hepatocytes and activates HSCs, thereby
promoting collagen secretion and fibrogenesis (149). In mice,
overexpression of hepatocyte TAZ is sufficient to drive NASH
progression, whereas TAZ silencing attenuates inflammation
and fibrosis (149). Hepatocyte Hippo pathway activity also
upregulates expression of the pro-inflammatory and pro￾fibrotic gene, Cyr61/CCN1, which is highly expressed in livers
of NASH patients (205).
Stressed and injured NASH hepatocytes express and secrete a
second Hedgehog ligand, Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), which is
positively correlated with hepatocyte ballooning, steatosis,
pericellular fibrosis, and fibrosis stage in liver samples from
NASH patients (206, 207). Hepatocytes that highly express SHH
appear colocalized within fibrotic areas in livers of NASH patients
(208), and are proximal to areas of hepatic progenitor cells (209),
consistent with the observation that SHH signaling promotes and
maintains a de-differentiated liver cell state (210). SHH-positive
livers from NASH patients express higher levels of fibrogenic and
immunomodulatory genes compared to SHH-negative NASH liver
samples, whose transcriptomes resemble steatotic, non-NASH
livers (209). Decreases in SHH expression are significantly
associated with improvement in histological features of NASH
and reduced prevalence of hepatic progenitor cells in patients
treated with vitamin E in the PIVENS trial (211). These data are
consistentwith a clear pro-fibrotic paracrine signal originatingfrom
the injured, ballooned hepatocyte.
In summary, the reprogramming of hepatocytes associated
with a profibrotic milieu results in loss of mature parenchymal
cells, characterized by loss of the master hepatocyte transcription
factor HNF4a (158, 212) and upregulation of the developmental
Notch, Hippo (213), and Hedgehog (214) signaling pathways. In
addition to accelerating the loss of metabolically competent

hepatocytes and liver function, advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis
restrict hepatic blood flow, increasing the risk of acute liver
failure, HCC, and liver-related mortality (215). The extensive
cross-talk between liver cell types during NASH pathogenesis
and progression underscores the importance of targeting
multiple aspects of liver physiology and pathophysiology in
treating this complex disease.
Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 Exerts Direct Anti￾Fibrotic Effects
FGF21 and its analogs have demonstrated consistent anti-fibrotic
effects in cell culture systems and animal models of NASH, liver
injury, or metabolic disease. An FGF21 analog reduces
expression of fibrogenic type I collagen and a-SMA in the LX￾2 human HSC line induced by either succinate, palmitate, or
culture medium devoid of methionine and choline (216).
Consistent with these gene expression changes, FGF21
significantly reduces HSC activation and proliferation in vitro
(216). FGF21 also inhibits ethanol- or PDGF-induced expression
of type I collagen and a-SMA in the T6 rat HSC line (217).
Examining hepatic gene expression and histology in vivo
corroborates FGF21’s direct inhibition of fibrosis arising from
liver injury induced by diverse insults. For example, in obese
diabetic mice fed a methionine and choline-deficient diet
(MCD), an FGF21 analog significantly reduces fibrogenic
expression and inhibits hepatic fibrosis (152). In the same
model, FGF21 also reduces the cholesterol level in the liver,
thereby suppressing activation of the Hippo pathway, which in
turn attenuates Indian Hedgehog (IHH)-dependent activation of
HSCs (204). In contrast, loss of FGF21 potentiates MCD￾induced liver injury and fibrosis, which is prevented by
administering exogenous FGF21 (218). Similarly, in an
alcohol-induced model of hepatic fibrosis, loss of FGF21
exacerbates liver injury and fibrosis (219). FGF21 also inhibits
fibrogenesis in two mouse models of chemically-induced liver
injury, dimethylnitrosamine- (217) or thioacetamide-induced
fibrogenesis (220), by blocking TGF-b expression and
signaling, and NF-kB activation.
Additional evidence for FGF21’s direct anti-fibrotic action is
provided by multiple models of tissue injury. FGF21 reduces
cerulein-induced exocrine pancreatitis in mice by activating
FGFR signaling in pancreatic acini and suppressing fibrogenic
gene expression (221). Administration or overexpression of
FGF21 reduces murine renal fibrosis in a diabetic model (222)
and a ureteral obstruction model (223). Likewise, FGF21
administration inhibits formation of bleomycin-induced
pulmonary fibrosis in vivo by suppressing oxidative stress via
NRF2 activation, and inhibiting TGF-b-induced activation of
pulmonary myofibroblasts (224).
FGF21’s breadth of antifibrotic effects are likely mediated
both by direct suppression of HSC activation, and by reductions
in expression and secretion of pro-fibrotic factors derived from
Kupffer cells and injured hepatocytes. With these diverse anti￾fibrotic effects, FGF21-based therapies may deliver clinically
meaningful histologic improvements independent of the extent
of fibrosis at baseline.
FIBROBLAST GROWTH FACTOR 21
IMPROVES WHOLE-BODY METABOLIC
HEALTH
In contrast to many candidates being clinically tested as potential
NASH therapeutics, FGF21 not only exerts direct effects on the
liver to improve its metabolic state, but also acts on whole body
metabolism to lighten the metabolic load on the liver.
Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 Improves
Peripheral Insulin Sensitivity and Promotes
Uptake of Energy by Adipose Tissue and
Skeletal Muscle
FGF21 stimulates insulin-mediated glucose uptake into adipose
tissue (43, 95, 225) in part by increasing expression of the glucose
transporter GLUT1 (43, 226). In cultured skeletal muscle
myotubes, elevated insulin stimulated FGF21 expression, and
FGF21 facilitated insulin-dependent energy uptake by
upregulating GLUT1 (227). FGF21 also stimulates adipose
tissue uptake of fatty acids derived from lipoproteins (i.e.,
VLDL and chylomicron) (228), which together with increased
glucose uptake functions to direct energy to adipose tissue and
effectively redirect calories away from the liver. FGF21 signaling
suppresses adipose tissue lipolysis (94, 229), particularly in the
fed state (230), and promotes adipocyte lipid homeostasis by
ameliorating lipogenesis-associated ER stress (231). FGF21 also
increases energy expenditure in mice via UCP1-dependent (232)
and UCP1-independent (233) mechanisms, which include
browning of white adipose tissue by upregulating PGC1a
(234). Together, these effects on adipose tissue and skeletal
muscle contribute to the role of FGF21 in mediating protection
against metabolic disease in numerous models (230, 235). In
diet-induced obese mice, exogenous FGF21 decreases body
weight and adiposity while improving whole-body insulin
sensitivity and lowering serum glucose, insulin, triglycerides,
and cholesterol (129, 235, 236). Similar improvements of
insulin sensitivity and glycemic control, have been observed in
obese non-diabetic, or diabetic non-human primates (44, 183,
237–239). Consistent with these beneficial effects being mediated
through adipose tissue, lipodystrophic mice with severely
depleted adiposity, or mice with adipose-specific deletion of
FGFR1 have blunted glycemic responses to FGF21 (240, 241).
In addition to directly enhancing energy uptake in adipose
tissue, FGF21 potently stimulates secretion of adiponectin from
adipocytes (44, 100, 225, 236, 242, 243). Increased levels of
adiponectin in non-human primates and humans with
metabolic disease (type 2 diabetes, obesity and NASH) have
been consistently observed following treatment with various
FGF21 analogs (183, 244–246). As an adipokine, adiponectin
signals from adipose tissue to distal tissues including liver (247).
Adiponectin has demonstrated antidiabetic and insulin
sensitizing actions (248), in part by suppressing endogenous
glucose production (249) and enhancing peripheral fat uptake
(250) by increasing lipoprotein lipase activity and enhancing
VLDL catabolism (251).
Tillman and Rolph Rationale for FGF21-Based NASH Therapies
Frontiers in Endocrinology | www.frontiersin.org December 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 601290 9

Consistent with improving uptake of energy by peripheral
tissues, adiponectin suppresses hepatic steatosis (252) and
inflammation (253) in animal models. Based on in vitro models
of NASH, adiponectin may also exert beneficial effects by acting
directly on the liver to reduce hepatic stellate cell activation and
migration (254–256). Adiponectin’s biological effects in the liver of
NASH patients may be reduced, since expression of its receptors is
lower than in liver of patients with simple steatosis (257). In
summary, FGF21 enhances peripheral uptake of energy both
directly through FGFR-mediated pathways, and indirectly via
increased adiponectin.
Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 Ameliorates
Dyslipidemia
The earliest and most consistent preclinical observation with
FG21 was its amelioration of dyslipidemia. Elevations in plasma
LDL-cholesterol, non-HDL-cholesterol, ApoB, and triglycerides
are well-established, independent, causal risk factors for
cardiovascular disease and major adverse cardiovascular events
(258). In diabetic, obese or MCD-induced NAFLD non-human
primates, FGF21 (44) or FGF21 analogs (237) robustly reduce
serum triglycerides, LDL-cholesterol, and VLDL-cholesterol
while increasing HDL-cholesterol. Conversely, knockdown of
FGF21 in mice fed a ketogenic diet significantly increases serum
lipemia and cholesterolemia (87). The consistent, robust effects
of FGF21 analogs are described in greater detail below.
FIBROBLAST GROWTH FACTOR 21
PROTECTS OTHER ORGANS STRESSED
BY CHRONIC ENERGY EXCESS AND
METABOLIC DYSFUNCTION
Pancreas
By sensitizing adipose tissue and skeletal muscle to insulin, FGF21
reduces demand for insulin secretion, in turn lessening demand for
energy generation by b cells. FGF21 also improves b cell
homeostasis by promoting autophagy and resistance to ER stress
(259, 260). In obese or diabetic mice, FGF21 restores the insulin
secretion capacity of b cells in vivo (261) via several pathways: first,
by activating AMPK signaling and autophagy (262); second, by
reducing the accumulation of lipotoxic lipids in the pancreas by
upregulating expression of CPT1 (which facilitates oxidation of
long-chain fatty acids) and downregulating the expression of
lipogenic genes SREBF1 and FASN (263); third, by restoring the
expression of core pancreatic genes including PDX1, INS (insulin),
and MafA (264); and finally, by reducing immune cell infiltration
and activation within islets (190).
FGF21 also protects the exocrine pancreas from pancreatitis
induced by cerulein, associated with accumulation of reactive
oxygen species, immune infiltration, and exocrine dysfunction
(265). FGF21 mRNA and protein expression is induced within
hours of cerulein-induced supraphysiological exocrine secretion,
consistent with an adaptive stress response program (221).
Transgenic expression of FGF21 in pancreatic acini reduces tissue
damage, lipid accumulation, and fibrosis induced by cerulein, all of
which were exacerbated in animals lacking FGF21 (221, 266).
Further, because the functional cells of the pancreas (both
exocrine acini and endocrine islets) are highly secretory, FGF21
plays a protective role by enhancing the response to ER stress via
activation of the UPR (189, 259). By restoring protein folding
homeostasis and secretory enzyme trafficking, FGF21 enhances
digestive enzyme secretion without increasing protein synthesis
(259). These protective responses are not limited to cerulein￾induced pancreatitis, but are also observed in mouse models of
alcohol-induced pancreatitis and obstructive pancreatitis (189).
Together, these stress-responsive, anti-inflammatory, and anti￾fibrotic actions of FGF21 preserve endocrine and exocrine function.
Cardiac and Skeletal Muscle
As with other cell types, FGF21 protects myocytes under cell
stress, particularly ER stress and oxidative stress. Because protein
chaperone function requires maintenance of intracellular
calcium homeostasis, overloaded myocytes are susceptible to
ER stress (267). Increased cytoplasmic calcium levels in
cardiomyocytes, arising from chronic overloading or
mitochondrial dysfunction, are associated with altered protein
folding, ER stress, and induction of FGF21 (113).
By mediating expression of the oxidative stress response genes,
FGF21 also protects cardiomyocytes from ischemic cell death (268)
and oxidative injury caused by LPS-induced inflammation (269). In
addition, FGF21 has been reported to protect the heart from
inflammation and fibrosis caused by high-fat diet-induced cardiac
steatosis (154). Consistent with this, FGF21 is induced by lipid
accumulation in cardiomyocytes (112).
Nervous System
The cytoprotective effects of FGF21, whether direct or indirect,
are also evident in the nervous system, where FGF21 treatment
attenuates neuroinflammation, neuronal oxidative stress, and
neurodegeneration and preserves cognitive function in diabetic
mice and high fat fed rats (270, 271). As in other tissues, FGF21
exerts anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing microglial NF￾kB signaling, thereby attenuating LPS-induced inflammatory
cytokine expression (272). FGF21 also reduces mitochondrial
stress in neurons in vitro (273) and in vivo (271), and improves
pathology in mouse models of Parkinson’s (274) and Alzheimer’s
disease (275).
FIBROBLAST GROWTH FACTOR 21
MODULATES FOOD PREFERENCE
AND FUEL UTILIZATION
FGF21 acts via three distinct mechanisms to modulate whole￾body metabolism. It modifies dietary preferences, regulates
metabolism at the level of individual organs, and integrates
whole-body metabolism of different substrates.
Firstly, modification of dietary preferences by FGF21 are
mediated by behavioral changes consistent with altered taste
preference in preclinical models and in humans. Consumption of
sucrose by both mice and humans induces FGF21, which serves as a
Tillman and Rolph Rationale for FGF21-Based NASH Therapies
Frontiers in Endocrinology | www.frontiersin.org December 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 601290 10

negative feedback mechanism to inhibit consumption (82, 276). In
mice, FGF21 deletion increases sucrose intake, whereas FGF21
administration or overexpression suppresses consumption of
sweetened food and beverages (276, 277). These actions appear to
be mediated by b-Klotho-expressing glutamatergic neurons in the
ventromedial hypothalamus (276) and paraventricular nucleus (278).
FGF21 administration to non-human primates also reduces sweet
preference, demonstrating a conserved effect on macronutrient
preference (277). FGF21 reduces murine preference for ethanol
while suppressing dopamine signaling (277). Conversely, a putative
loss-of-function FGF21 allele in humans is associated with greater
intake of alcohol (82), preference for sweet foods (279), and altered
macronutrient intake (280), but has no effect on total caloric
consumption. Additionally, a genome-wide meta-analysis also
linked aKLB genetic variant with altered alcohol consumption (281).
Secondly, FGF21 appears to modulate substrate utilization by
individual organs. For example, it appears to switch cardiomyocyte
energy productionfrom glucose utilization tofatty acid oxidation in
mice, dependent on UCP2 induction (282). In myocytes isolated
from myopathy patients with an iron-sulfur cluster deficiency,
elevated FGF21 expression and secretion correlate with increased
expression of ketogenic enzymes (111).
Thirdly, protein restriction in humans (283) and rodents (84),
particularly with concomitant high-carbohydrate dietary content
(284), increases circulating FGF21. Protein restriction may
contribute to perturbations in cellular protein homeostasis,
resulting in GCN2-mediated, ATF4-dependent activation of
FGF21 expression (84). Higher levels of FGF21 may help to
rebalance amino acid availability by enhancing TFEB-dependent
lysosomal biogenesis, thereby enabling turnover of proteins within
tissues and organs. On a high-fat diet, expression of FGF21
increases whole-body energy expenditure and increases
carbohydrate, relative to fatty acid, catabolism (223). Similarly, in
diabeticmice, a PEGylated FGF21 analog increases the contribution
of glucose to whole-body energy consumption, potentiating
glycemic control without affecting body weight (285). On the
other hand, mice on a control diet with transgenic overexpression
of FGF21 significantly increase ketogenesis in the fed state,
consistent with enhanced fat oxidation (89, 286).
In mice, FGF21 appears to improve glycemic control and lipid
homeostasis via centrally-mediated pathways (287, 288). For
example, selective knock out of b-Klotho in regions of the central
nervous system abolishes induction of adipose tissue browning,
while centralinfusion of FGF21increased energy expenditure (289).
While endogenous FGF21 is detectable in human cerebrospinal
fluid at much lower concentrations than plasma FGF21, it is
positively correlated with adiposity (290). However, the extent of
FGF21’s centrally mediated effects remains to be determined in
humans. For example, while FGF21 stimulates sympathetic
activation in mice, elevations in cortisol that would suggest
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activation have not been
observed in monkeys (239). In mice, the bulk of the metabolic
improvement seen upon FGF21 treatment derives from centrally
mediated weight loss, whereas FGF21 analogs elicit limited weight
loss in humans. Overall, these differences suggest the contributions
of FGF21’s diverse metabolic effects vary across species.
In summary, suppression of dietary intake of fructose and
sucrose by FGF21 could both reduce liver fat and maintain it at a
lower level. In addition, rebalancing of substrate utilization at
both organ and whole body level by FGF21 should contribute to
improving and maintaining whole body metabolic homeostasis.
FIBROBLAST GROWTH FACTOR 21
ANALOGS: CLINICAL EXPERIENCE IN
PATIENTS WITH METABOLIC DISEASE
In humans, FGF21 analogs have recapitulated many of the lipid
effects and some of the glycemic effects observed in preclinical
species, though notably not with all compounds tested (Figure
3B). A glycosylated FGF21 variant, LY2405319, maintains the
molecular size of endogenous FGF21 but improves its thermal
stability and reduces aggregation by engineering an additional
disulfide bond and a small number of point mutations into the
molecule (291). While the half-life of LY2405319 was not
reported, the fact that it was administered daily, coupled with
the lack of half-life-extending modifications, suggest a short half￾life. Notably, the C-terminal FAP cleavage site remains
unmodified, suggesting that LY2405319 is likely susceptible to
cleavage and inactivation in human serum via loss affinity for
KLB (Figure 3A). Daily administration of LY2405319 to type 2
diabetes patients for 4 weeks significantly reduced triglycerides
by about 45% and LDL-cholesterol by 20–30% from baseline,
while increasing HDL-cholesterol by 15–20% and adiponectin by
up to 80% (244). LY2405319 administration also reduced levels
of ApoB from baseline by up to 20% and ApoC-III by up to 35%,
consistent with a shift to a less atherogenic lipoprotein profile.
There were slight but not statistically significant decreases in
body weight, fasting insulin, and fasting glucose from baseline
compared to placebo.
Another analog, PF-05231023, is a 190 kDa molecule consisting
of human FGF21 covalently linked to each Fab region of a
humanized IgG1k mAb scaffold, resulting in a 2:1 stoichiometry
of FGF21 molecules per scaffold (292). In type 2 diabetes patients,
twice-weekly administration of PF-05231023 for 4 weeks reduced
body weight by about 5%, triglycerides by about 50%, and LDL￾cholesterol by about 20% from baseline, while increasing HDL￾cholesterol by about 15% and adiponectin 15- to 20-fold (183).
However, modest decreases in glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR
(homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance) did not reach
statistical significance (183). Weekly administration of the same
molecule for 4 weeks in a second study with obese
hypertriglyceridemic subjects demonstrated similar effects on
triglycerides, HDL- and non-HDL cholesterol, and adiponectin,
but without affecting body weight (293). Although PF-05231023
demonstrated pharmacodynamic effects when dosed weekly or
twice-weekly in humans, the unmodified N- and C-termini of the
FGF21 moities resulted in a short (approximately 8 h) half-life for
the intact C-terminal domain of FGF21 (183). As with LY2405319,
it appears unlikely that a high level of agonism of FGF21’s receptors
was sustained between doses.

A PEGylated FGF21, pegbelfermin (formerly BMS-986036),
consists of a 30 kDa PEG moiety attached to residue 108 of
FGF21, yielding a 50 kDa analog (285). One of only two FGF21
analogs tested in a study of biopsy-confirmed NASH patients,
pegbelfermin administered daily or weekly for 16 weeks reduced
triglycerides by 5% and LDL-cholesterol by about 10% from
baseline, while increasing HDL-cholesterol by about 12% and
adiponectin by 15% (245). No effects on body weight or glycemic
control were reported in this study. While the changes in lipid
parameters are smaller compared to those elicited by LY2405319 or
PF-05231023, pegbelfermin is the first FGF21 analog to
demonstrate beneficial hepatic effects in NASH patients, with
daily administration yielding approximately a 30% relative
reduction in liver fat content. Pegbelfermin additionally reduced
levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and Pro-C3 (a
marker of fibrogenesis) by up to 30%, consistent with improved
hepatic health. Notably, daily dosing of 10 mg pegbelfermin
delivered stronger improvements in clinical parameters than
weekly dosing of 20 mg pegbelfermin, consistent with a reported
intact C-terminal half-life of 1–1.5 days in humans (294). Daily or
weekly administration of pegbelfermin for 12 weeks in type 2
diabetes patients recapitulated these modest effects on lipid
parameters without altering body weight, and did not elicit
clinically or statistically significant changes in markers of
glycemic control (295). Because of the location of the PEG moiety
and absence of additional modifications at the C-terminus of the
FGF21 moiety, pegbelfermin remains susceptible to FAP cleavage
and inactivation.
Efruxifermin (formerly AKR-001, AMG 876), the only other
FGF21 analog studied in a clinical trial of biopsy-confirmed NASH
patients, is a 92 kDa Fc-FGF21fusion protein with a 3–3.5 day half￾life (based on intact C-terminal domain of the FGF21 moiety),
which is substantially extended relative to the FGF21 analogs
described above. This longer half-life results both from
endosomal recycling mediated by the neonatal Fc receptor, and
from stabilization of the N- and C-termini of the FGF21 moiety.
Because the Fc domain is translated directly upstream of a peptide
linker and N-terminus of the FGF21 variant, the N-terminus is
protectedfrom degradation by dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP) enzymes
(296). Protection of the C-terminus is achieved via substitution of a
glycine for the native proline at residue 171 (P171G) relative to
mature (i.e., signal peptide removed) human FGF21, preventing
degradation by FAP. In the context of a potential therapyfor NASH,
stabilization against FAP degradation is noteworthy because
expression of FAP is greatly elevated in liver from NASH patients
compared to appropriate control liver (297). Two additional
substitutions further enhance the in vivo activity of efruxifermin:
A180E, which increases affinityfor KLB, and L98R, which decreases
aggregation (238). Efruxifermin retainsin vitro balanced potency as
an agonist of FGFR1c, FGFR2c, and FGFR3c, a characteristic that
may be required to elicit maximal effects on liver and extra-hepatic
tissues. In a 4-week study in type 2 diabetes patients, weekly
administration of up to 70 mg efruxifermin reduced triglycerides
by 60–70%, non-HDL-cholesterol by about 35%, fasting insulin
about 50%, and fasting glucose about 20% compared to baseline,
while increasing HDL-cholesterol by 60% and adiponectin by about
95% (246). Efruxifermin did not significantly alter body weight over
this 4-week trial but did significantly reduce the atherogenic
lipoproteins ApoB and ApoC-III to a greater extent than did
LY2405319 over the same period. Intriguingly, weekly but not
every-other-weekly administration of efruxifermin demonstrated
for the first time that an FGF21 analog could deliver improved
glycemic control in humans, suggesting that the limitations of
previous molecules may have been rooted in inadequate
exposure. In a subsequent, 16-week study in biopsy-confirmed
F1–F3 NASH patients, approximately half of whom were type 2
diabetes patients, efruxifermin improved glycemic control with
significant reductions in HbA1c at doses up to 70 mg weekly.
Improvements in lipid and lipoprotein profile were also observed,
consistent with those seen after 4 weeks’ treatment. Efruxifermin
reduced liver fat content by over 70% after 12 weeks dosing. For the
first time, an FGF21 analog induced a strong reduction in liver fat
that appeared to be associated with resolution of histological
features of NASH, including fibrosis (298). An observed rapid
and sustained 30% reduction in serum Pro-C3 levels is consistent
with preclinical literature demonstrating FGF21’s antifibrotic
activity, and with the reduction in Pro-C3 observed upon
pegbelfermin treatment. Finally, the longer 16-week dosing
revealed efruxifermin-associated weight loss.
A second PEGylated FGF21, BIO89-100, prevents C-terminal
degradation by attachment of a PEG moiety to the amino acid
residue adjacent to the FAP cleavage site, resulting in a 2.5–4 day
half-life in healthy volunteers. This analog retains balanced in vitro
potency at FGFR1c, FGFR2c, and FGFR3c (299). In a multiple￾ascending dose study in NAFLD subjects, about 20% of whom had
biopsy-confirmed NASH, weekly or every-other-weekly
administration of BIO89-100 for 12 weeks reduced serum
triglycerides by 18–28%, reduced liver fat by 36–60%, and
increased adiponectin by 23–61% relative to baseline (299).
Notably, only the highest dose of BIO89-100 administered weekly
appeared to elicit strong pharmacodynamic effects mediated via
FGFR1c activity in adipose tissue, i.e., significantly increasing
systemic levels of adiponectin. Every-other-weekly administration
of BIO89-100 did not improve markers of glycemic control, with
only the highest once-weekly dose showing a trend towards
improvements (299). The smaller magnitude of effect on liver fat,
HbA1c and lipoprotein profile for BIO89-100 with every-other￾weekly dosing appears to limit the value of extending the dosing
regimen (299).
Two antibody-based approaches have been developed to mimic
FGF21 signaling through FGFR1c only. BFKB8488A is a humanized
bispecific antibody that specifically activates the FGFR1/b-Klotho
complex (300). In a 12-week study in NAFLD patients, every-other￾weekly administration of up to 100 mg BFKB8488A, the highest
adequately tolerated dose, reduced liver fat by about 40%, serum
triglycerides and Pro-C3 by up to 25 to 30% from baseline, while
increasing adiponectin by up to 40% and HDL-cholesterol by up to
20% (301). A parallel study of BFKB8488A in type 2 diabetes patients
recapitulated improvements in HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, and
adiponectin, but did not demonstrate improvements in HbA1c,
fasting glucose, or fasting insulin (302). Changes in body weight
were not reported in either study.

Another monoclonal antibody targeted to b-Klotho and
FGFR1c, MK-3655 (formerly NGM313), has been tested in a
single-dose study by comparison with pioglitazone (303). It has
an extended half-life, and appeared to improve glycemic control
in obese, non-diabetic subjects. Liver fat content was reduced by
30–35% relative to baseline at day 36 after administration, while
serum triglycerides and LDL-cholesterol were reduced and HDL￾cholesterol increased (303). As observed with pioglitazone, MK￾3655 was associated with statistically significant weight gain from
baseline to day 36. Based on these data, monthly dosing may be
achievable with MK3655.
Factors Underlying Differences Between
Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 Analogs
While LY2405319 (244), PF-05231023 (183), efruxifermin (246),
BFKB8488A (301), and MK-3655 (303) were observed to
ameliorate dyslipidemia, with strong reductions in triglycerides
and increases in HDL-cholesterol, only efruxifermin and MK￾3655 have so far demonstrated the potential to increase insulin
sensitivity and to improve glycemic control. Further, while
pegbelfermin (245), BFKB8488A (301), BIO89-100 (299), MK￾3655 (303), and efruxifermin (298) have all been associated with
reductions in ALT, Pro-C3, and hepatic fat fraction, the observed
magnitude of liver fat reduction was greatest following
efruxifermin treatment. Several structural parameters
differentiate these molecules that may explain the different
clinical profiles (Figure 3B).
Maximal reduction of liver fat appears to require both
inhibition of hepatic de novo lipogenesis and suppression of
adipose tissue lipolysis (51, 52). For FGF21 analogs, this is likely
to require balanced agonism of FGFR1c, FGFR2c and possibly
FGFR3c. The almost 2-fold greater reduction in liver fat with
efruxifermin than with FGFR1-selective BFKB8488A is
consistent with this argument, as FGFR1c agonism would
mainly reduce steatosis by suppressing adipose tissue lipolysis.
While the in vitro potency of pegbelfermin as an agonist of
FGFR1c, FGFR2c and FGFR3c has not been reported, the modest
induction of adiponectin in humans suggests that it exerts
minimal action through adipose tissue FGFR1c in humans. As
a result, suppression of adipose tissue lipolysis by pegbelfermin is
likely limited. Consistent with this, pegbelfermin reduced liver
fat by about half the extent of efruxifermin, and serum
triglyceride by about 10%, compared to about 30–50% for
other FGF21 analogs, including FGFR1c selective antibodies.
BIO89-100, on the other hand, appears to deliver relative hepatic
fat loss in between efruxifermin and pegbelfermin, with the
highest dose reducing fat content by 60% in NAFLD patients,
and all other doses reducing fat content by 36–50% (299). While
BIO89-100 has been reported to be a balanced agonist of FGF21’s
receptors in vitro, the smaller magnitude of effect on adiponectin
compared to efruxifermin suggest that BIO89-100 may not have
maximally stimulated FGFR1c signaling in adipose tissue at the
doses tested in humans (Figure 3B). Notably, comparisons of
these analogs are limited because efruxifermin and pegbelfermin
have been evaluated in patients with confirmed NASH, while
BIO89-100 has been studied in patients with less severe NAFLD.
FGF21’s effects on glycemic control and insulin sensitivity are
likely mediated predominantly by FGFR1c signaling in adipose
tissue, which should normally serve as one of the body’s main
depots for excess calories in response to post-meal insulin. To
enhance insulin sensitivity and improve glycemic control, it
appears that FGF21 analogs must maintain FGFR1c activation
in adipose tissue above a threshold level throughout the inter￾dose interval. For example, 70 mg efruxifermin dosed weekly,
corresponding to two pharmacokinetic half-lives, appeared to
improve HOMA-IR, fasting glucose, and fasting insulin in type 2
diabetes patients (246). By comparison, every-other-weekly
dosing of 140 mg achieved equivalent total exposure over 4
weeks, but with four pharmacokinetic half-lives between doses,
did not appear to improve glycemic control, despite comparable
effects on serum triglycerides and lipoproteins. Consistent with
this, the FGR1c-selective MK-3655, with the long half-life of a
monoclonal antibody, is the only other FGF21 analog that
appears to improve glycemic control, though repeat-dose data
has not been reported. The b-Klotho/FGFR1 bispecific agonist
antibody, BFKB8488A, failed to improve glycemic control,
suggesting that there may have been insufficient agonism of
FGFR1c throughout the every-other-weekly dosing interval.
Differentiation Between Analogs of
Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 and
Fibroblast Growth Factor 19
An FGF19 analog, aldafermin (formerly NGM282, M70) has a
five-amino acid deletion and three amino acid substitutions in the
N-terminal region of human FGF19 (304). This engineering was
necessary to reduce the proliferative effect of native FGF19 on
hepatocytes, mediated via signaling through FGFR4—the only
FGF receptor at which FGF19 and FGF21 differ in agonist activity
(305). When administered to patients with NASH for 12 weeks,
aldafermin (up to 6 mg daily) reduced liver fat content by up to
60% relative to baseline, reduced ALT by about 50%, and
decreased Pro-C3 by about 20–25% (31). However, consistent
with FGFR4-mediated suppression of CYP7A1, which catalyzes
the rate limiting step of cholesterol metabolism to bile acid,
aldafermin significantly increased LDL-cholesterol and non￾HDL cholesterol without exerting a consistent effect on insulin,
glucose, or HbA1c. In a longer-term 24-week study in NASH
patients, daily administration of 1 mg aldafermin led to an
approximately 30% placebo-adjusted relative reduction in liver
fat while reducing ALT by about 45% from baseline. However,
statin co-administration was required in more than 95% of treated
subjects to mitigate the increase in LDL-cholesterol, which was
also observed previously at higher doses (306). This study
confirmed that aldafermin treatment did not improve glycemic
control. The lack of effect of FGF19 on glycemic control is
consistent with preclinical studies. For example, selective FGFR4
agonism, either peripherally or in liver, does not affect fasting
glucose in obese diabetic mice, but increases triglycerides and total
cholesterol (307, 308). Conversely, either germline knockout or
antisense oligonucleotide knockdown of FGFR4 expression in
mice enhances hepatic fat oxidation, glucose metabolism, and
insulin sensitivity (308–310) while reducing hepatic steatosis (308,
Tillman and Rolph Rationale for FGF21-Based NASH Therapies
Frontiers in Endocrinology | www.frontiersin.org December 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 601290 14

309). While these metabolic effects were likely to have been
mediated by compensatory upregulation of FGF19 and/or
FGF21 (308), they were clearly independent of FGFR4 agonism,
instead being mediated by agonism of FGFR1c, 2c or 3c.
As elevated bile acids are associated with fibrotic liver disease,
and FGF19–FGFR4 signaling suppresses bile acid synthesis, it has
been posited that reducing bile acids may deliver anti-fibrotic
actions (311). However, anti-fibrotic actions of FGF19 signaling
do not appear to depend on FGFR4 signaling, based on three lines
of evidence. First, both FGF21 (216, 217) and FGF19 (312) directly
inhibit HSC activation and proliferation in vitro. Second, FGF21
suppresses TGF-b release from pro-inflammatory macrophages in
vitro (177), which would be expected to reduce Kupffer cell
activation of HSCs in vivo. While a similar effect does not
appear to have been reported for FGF19, this indirect anti￾fibrotic effect of FGF21 suggests that FGFR4 is unnecessary for
inhibition of Kupffer cell-HSC signaling. Third, analogs of FGF21
and FGF19 appear to reduce markers of liver injury (ALT) and
fibrosis (Pro-C3) to a similar extent in humans (245, 306),
consistent with FGFR4 agonism not being required in vivo,
while being associated with an undesirable increase in LDL-C.
Safety and Tolerability of Fibroblast
Growth Factor 21 Analogs in Clinical Trials
Preclinical studies have suggested that FGF21 increases tone of
the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (287, 288).
However, whether FGF21 analogs modulate the HPA axis in
humans remains incompletely characterized. Increased levels of
corticotropin-releasing hormone or corticosterone/cortisol with
FGF21 or FGF21 analog treatment have been reported in
rodents, but not in non-human primates nor in any human
studies (183, 293, 313). Likewise, reports of FGF21 increasing
water intake and blood pressure in rodents, potentially by
stimulating sympathetic pathways (313, 314) do not appear to
translate consistently to humans, with one study (293) but no
others (183, 244–246, 315) suggesting an effect. The lack of effect
is consistent with blood pressure phenotypes of humans with
FGF21 genetic variants. The minor A allele of rs838133
corresponds to a putative FGF21 loss-of-function allele, which
is associated with 0.29 mmHg higher systolic blood pressure per
allele (279). This study also identified a rare variant encoding a
truncated, putatitive loss-of-function FGF21 protein, associated
with 7.5 mmHg higher blood pressure. Additionally,
administration or overexpression of FGF21 reduces blood
pressure in various preclinical models of hypertension (316–
318). Overall, the preclinical and clinical data do not support a
likely hypertensive effect of FGF21 analogs downstream of
increased sympathetic tone in humans.
The apparent differences between rodents and primates may
reflect differences in blood-brain barrier permeability across
species (319). Mice in particular (320) may be more sensitive
to systemically administered FGF21 and FGF21 analogs than
humans. Larger molecules based on antibody scaffolds and
fragments, including PF-05231023 (190 kDa), BFKB8488A and
MK-3655 (150 kDa), and efruxifermin (92 kDa) may be less
likely to cross the blood-brain barrier at therapeutic doses, but
their tissue distribution has not been described. Emerging
clinical observations with smaller FGF21 analogs including
pegbelfermin (50 kDa) and BIO89-100 (40 kDa), may provide
insights into effects possibly mediated via the central
nervous system.
While some preclinical studies with FGF21 and FGF21
analogs have suggested effects on bone turnover, clinical data
have not demonstrated a consistent effect. One group
demonstrated that FGF21 increased bone resorption and
decreased bone mass in mice (321), in part via induction of
hepatic insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP1)
(322). However, a more recent preclinical study did not find
evidence of FGF21-induced bone loss in a diet-induced model of
obesity (323). While the first clinical trial of PF-05231023
demonstrated a decrease in markers of bone formation and an
increase in markers of bone resorption, this was accompanied by
a significant reduction in body weight. A subsequent study of PF￾05231023 did not demonstrate weight loss, and there were no
changes observed in markers of bone formation or resorption,
IGFBP1–3, or free IGF1 (293). No subsequent clinical studies of
FGF21 analogs in adults have demonstrated a significant effect
on bone density or markers of bone resorption and formation in
adults (245, 246, 295). Notably, while markers of type I collagen
synthesis and degradation are frequently used to indicate
changes in bone turnover, they may also reflect changes in
liver fibrogenesis or fibrinolysis (324, 325). Overall, the weight
of evidence to date does not support a role for FGF21 in
mediating bone remodeling in adult humans.
The most prevalent and consistent dose-limiting side effects
observed across studies of FGF21 analogs in patients with
metabolic disease are gastrointestinal (GI), including mild-to￾moderate nausea and diarrhea (183, 245, 246, 298, 301). These
side effects were also seen in trials of the FGF19 analog, aldafermin
(31, 306). However, preclinical studies of these various endocrine
FGF analogs in rodents and monkeys did not reveal GI symptoms,
therefore the potential mechanisms underlying adverse GI effects
have not been investigated (Table 2). It is possible that FGF21
exerts some direct or indirect effect on the GI tract, but experiments
directly testing this hypothesis have not been reported to date.
Whether GI tolerability affects patient adherence to or uptake
of FGF21-based therapies in NASH remains to be seen. However,
precedent suggests that mild to moderate adverse GI events are
not a major barrier to uptake of a promising metabolic therapy.
While GLP-1 analogs for treatment of type 2 diabetes cause mild￾to-moderate nausea and vomiting in a significant proportion of
patients, their benefits in terms of weight loss and improved
glycemic control have allowed the class to overcome these
tolerability concerns and become one of the most-prescribed
classes of type 2 diabetes medications in the US and Europe
(326). Second, up-titration regimens for GLP-1 analogs have
mitigated adverse GI side effects, reducing their prevalence and
severity in both clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance
(327). FGF21 analogs have not so far employed up-titration, but
given the reportedly mild-to-moderate as well as the transient
nature of the nausea and diarrhea, such an approach could
reasonably be expected to mitigate the GI side effects.

CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK
Despite uninspiring outcomes in clinical trials of the first wave of
potential NASH therapies, a spate of promising mid-to-late stage
clinical trials has provided a neededmorale boost to NASH patients,
endocrinologists and hepatologists, and caregivers. The complex
pathophysiology of NASH mandates a holistic approach to treating
patients, focusing not only on liver histology but also cardiovascular
risk and glycemic control, which has proven to be a high bar
(Table 1).
An FXR agonist, obeticholic acid, is the first molecule to deliver a
statistically significant improvement in one of the FDA’s surrogate
endpoints for accelerated approval of a treatment for NASH.
However, it is associated with a risk of liver injury in patients with
primary biliary cholangitis (328), and significantly elevates LDL￾cholesterol (30, 32). FGF19, like FXR agonists, has demonstrated
potential to improve liver histology, but also exacerbates
dyslipidemia already common in NASH patients (306). Inhibitors
of acetyl-CoA carboxylase demonstrate a reduction in hepatic fat
fraction, but significantly increase serum triglyceride levels (34).
PPAR agonists have demonstrated insulin sensitizing effects and
some liver-specific improvements, but are associated with increased
body weight (329). The GLP-1 analog semaglutide demonstrated a
strong ability to resolve NASH, and is associated with weight loss
and improved cardiovascular health, but did not statistically
significantly improve fibrosis (326). TR-b agonists have
demonstrated improvements in liver fat and biomarkers of
cardiovascular disease along with significant resolution of NASH,
but have not demonstrated a strong anti-fibrotic effect (330).Across
the field of potential NASH drugs, each mechanistic class appears to
deliver improvements in a subset of liver histology, whole-body
metabolism, or cardiovascular risk profile, but not all three.
Moreover, some mechanisms worsen cardiovascular risk profile
despite improving liver health, which appears incompatible with
long-term use in patients with increased cardiovascular risk.
FGF21 analogs therefore represent a promising emerging class
of NASH therapeutics, as a number of them have demonstrated
pleiotropic effects consistent with improved liver health and whole￾body metabolism. Because of an elevated risk of cardiovascular
morbidity and mortality in NASH patients prior to advanced
fibrosis, as well as hepatic decompensation, HCC, and/or liver
failure, therapeutic options must address the complex
pathophysiology of this disease. Analogs of FGF21 that are able to
maintain balanced and sustained agonism of FGFR1c, FGFR2c, and
FGFR3c throughout theinter-dose interval appear to show the most
promising pharmacological profiles, with among the largest
reported decreases in liver fat of any therapeutic mechanism
tested in NASH patients, and with encouraging signs of resolving
NASH histology and fibrosis after relatively short-term treatment.
FGF21 analogs with balanced receptor agonism and sustained
exposure have also been shown to improve glycemic control,
ameliorate dyslipidemia and reduce body weight. Should this
pharmacological profile be confirmed in late-stage clinical studies,
optimized FGF21 analogs have the potential to not only resolve liver
pathology, but also to reduce risk of cardiovascular morbidity and
mortality, and incidence of organ damage associated with
inadequate glycemic control.
