Abstract
Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) are two potent cell survival and regenerative factors
in response to myocardial injury (MI). We hypothesized that simultaneous delivery of IGF+HGF combined with Sca-1+
/
CD312 cells would improve the outcome of transplantation therapy in response to the altered hostile microenvironment
post MI. One million adenovirus nuclear LacZ-labeled Sca-1+
/CD312 cells were injected into the peri-infarction area after left
anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) ligation in mice. Recombinant mouse IGF-1+HGF was added to the cell
suspension prior to the injection. The left ventricular (LV) function was assessed by echocardiography 4 weeks after the
transplantation. The cell engraftment, differentiation and cardiomyocyte regeneration were evaluated by histological
analysis. Sca-1+
/CD312 cells formed viable grafts and improved LV ejection fraction (EF) (Control, 54.5+/22.4; MI, 17.6+/2
3.1; Cell, 28.2+/24.2, n = 9, P,0.01). IGF+HGF significantly enhanced the benefits of cell transplantation as evidenced by
increased EF (38.8+/22.2; n = 9, P,0.01) and attenuated adverse structural remodeling. Furthermore, IGF+HGF
supplementation increased the cell engraftment rate, promoted the transplanted cell survival, enhanced angiogenesis,
and minimally stimulated endogenous cardiomyocyte regeneration in vivo. The in vitro experiments showed that IGF+HGF
treatment stimulated Sca-1+
/CD312 cell proliferation and inhibited serum free medium induced apoptosis. Supperarray
profiling of Sca-1+
/CD312 cells revealed that Sca-1+
/CD312 cells highly expressed various trophic factor mRNAs and IGF+
HGF treatment altered the mRNAs expression patterns of these cells. These data indicate that IGF-1+HGF could serve as an
adjuvant to cell transplantation for myocardial repair by stimulating donor cell and endogenous cardiac stem cell survival,
regeneration and promoting angiogenesis.

Introduction
The left ventricular (LV) remodeling that occurs following
myocardial infarction (MI) results, in part, from the abnormal LV
wall stresses that develop in surviving myocardium. The increased
wall stress is thought to induce adverse molecular responses in the
residual myocardium [1–3]. Importantly, the limited ability of the
heart to regenerate lost cardiomyocytes and vascular cells
contributes to the severity of LV remodeling. Therefore,
administration of various types of presumed cardiac regenerative
cells including skeletal muscle myoblasts, marrow derived mesen￾chymal stem cells (MSCs), endogenous cardiac stem cells (CSCs),
endothelial progenitor cells, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)
and embryonic stem cells to hearts following acute infarction
(acute MI) has been attempted in the hope of stimulating cardiac
regeneration [4–9]. It is well known that many animal and clinical
trials have indicated that cell transplantation modestly improves
cardiac function in post-MI hearts. However, in most animal
studies persistent engraftment of transplanted cells has been
minimal and few of the transplanted cells appear to have
proliferated and differentiated into new cardiomyocytes or
vascular cells [10–12].
The microenvironment in acutely injured myocardium has been
considered to be hostile to both donor cell and native CSCs
survival and propagation because of the presence of hypoxia,
acidosis, inflammatory mediators, and reactive oxygen and
nitrogen species [13–14]. Hence, attempts to ameliorate this
‘‘transplantation hostile’’ state have been made including the
injection of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and hepatocyte
growth factor (HGF) into the acutely injured heart. IGF-1 and
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 June 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e95247

HGF are potent cell survival and regeneration factors [15–16] and
cardiac restricted over-expression of IGF-1 increases the formation
of ventricular myocytes and attenuates myocyte death [17–18].
IGF-1 receptor activation induces division of CSCs, upregulates
telomerase activity, and preserves the pool of functionally
competent CSCs [17–18]. HGF also enhances survival of mature
cardiomyocytes under ischemic conditions [19–20]. Moreover,
intramyocardial HGF gene therapy post-MI is associated with
increased angiogenesis and preservation of cardiac contractile
function [21–22].
Consistent with these observations, studies from the laboratories
of Anversa and his colleagues have shown, in both large and small
animal studies, that the intra-myocardial combined injection of
HGF and IGF facilitated survival of endogenous c-kit+ CSCs (the
majority of which were Sca-1+
) and enhanced their migration to
injured areas, their proliferation, and differentiation into cardio￾myocytes and vascular cells [6,23–25]. Significant cardiomyocyte
regeneration from CSCs associated with partial repopulation of
the infarct scar zone was also present and it is likely that survival of
native cardiomyocytes was also increased in these post-MI hearts.
In consequence, substantial attenuation of the structural and
functional consequences of LV remodeling was present in these
studies.
It is well known that Sca-1 is an antigen located in the plasma
membrane of many lines of progenitor cells. Hence, we previously
studied the effects of intra-myocardial injection of allogenic heart
derived Sca-1+
/CD312 cells into the peri-infarct region of acutely
infarcted mouse hearts; we observed attenuation of LV remodeling
with the result that cardiac contractile function and energy
metabolism were partially preserved [26]. However, evidence of
significant myocardial regeneration from engrafted cells was not
present in these hearts despite the fact that our cardiac derived
Sca-1+
/CD312 cells were able to differentiate to early cardiomy￾ocytes under in vitro conditions. We have also reported that post￾MI LV remodeling is significantly worse in the hearts of Sca-1
(heterozygote) knockout mice (Sca-12/+
)[27]. Collectively, these
data suggested that the presence of Sca-1+
/CD312 cells in the
myocardium improved the response to an ischemic insult.
Based on the aforementioned data, we hypothesized that the
simultaneous delivery of IGF+HGF and heart derived Sca-1+
/
CD312 cells into the LV peri-infarction zone after coronary
occlusion would attenuate LV remodeling more than would cell
transplantation alone and the increased benefits of combined
treatment would be due, in part, to increased cardiomyocyte
regeneration from transplanted and endogenous CSCs.
We found that IGF+HGF administration combined with cell
transplantation significantly increased the rate of Sca-1+
/CD312
cell engraftment, reduced infarct size, and further attenuated post￾acute MI LV structural and functional remodeling as compared to
the results achieved by injection of Sca-1+
/CD312 cells alone.
However, in contradiction to hypothesis, there was no evidence
that functionally significant numbers of either engrafted Sca-1+
/
CD312 cells or endogenous CSCs differentiated into new
cardiomyocytes. Rather, the data suggested that the beneficial
effects of transplantation were the result of increased paracrine
signaling which resulted in additional protection of native
cardiomyocytes from death (apoptotic and/or necrotic) and the
maintenance of normal capillary density in the peri-infarct zone of
the LV; The latter phenomenon likely helped to preserve the
performance of this myocardial region. Data from our in vitro
experiments support these views because firstly, IGF+HGF
treatment enhanced the survival of cultured Sca-1+
/CD312 cells
during serum deprivation induced stress; Secondly, co-culture of
atrium derived HL-1 cells with Sca-1+
/CD312 cells protected the
HL-1 cells from death induced by three different stressors (TNFa,
hypoxia or H2O2), and lastly, exposure of Sca-1+
/CD312 cells to
IGF+HGF altered the expressions of a number of trophic factors
associated mRNAs; the latter finding might indicate the presence
of an increased level of paracrine signaling emanating from these
cells.
Materials and Methods
Wild-type mice (BALB/c, 8–10 weeks) were purchased from
Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, http://www.jax.org). The
University of Minnesota Animal Care Committee approved all
procedures and protocols. The investigation conformed to the
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the Institute
of Laboratory Animal Research.
Sca-1+
/CD312 and Sca-12/CD312 Cell Isolation and
Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting Analysis
The isolation and expansion of Sca-1+
/CD312 and Sca-12/
CD312 cells were performed with modifications of previously
described methods [26,28–29] and these techniques are described
in detail in the supporting information (Text S1).
Determination of the Effects of IGF+HGF on Serum
Deprivation Induced Sca-1+
/CD312 Cell Apoptosis and
Proliferation
For determining the effects of IGF+HGF on Sca-1+
/CD312
cell apoptosis, cells were cultured in cardio-sphere growth medium
(CGM) and then placed in 6 well plates. Following an additional
24 hours of culture, groups of these cells were exposed to serum
free medium with or the addition of IGF(100 ng/ml)+
HGF(100 ng/ml) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). This treat￾ment was continued for 48 hours and the cells were then stained
with Annexin V conjugates (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and
assessed by flow cytometry according to manufacture’s directions.
For cell proliferation analysis, Sca-1+
/CD312 cells were synchro￾nized in serum free medium for 12 hours. Group of cells treated
with basal medium plus 0.5% FBS for 24 hours served as a control
group. The treatment group is the group of cells added
IGF(100 ng)+HGF(100 ng) in the basal medium plus 0.5% FBS
for 24 hours of culture. Cell proliferation was detected using
Cycletest Plus DNA Reagent Kit (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA)
and assessed by flow cytometry. The acquired data was analyzed
using commercial software (FlowJo, Ashland, OR) and the
mathematical model of Dean-Jett- Fox was used in the cell cycle
analysis.
Superarray Analysis of mRNA Expression Patterns in Sca￾1+
/CD312 Cells Treated with IGF+HGF
For gene array analysis, total mRNA from Sca-1+
/CD312 cells
was isolated using RNeasy columns with mRNAase-free DNAase
treatment. 1 mg of total mRNA was reversely transcripted into
cDNA using a RT first strand kit following the manufacture’s
directions (SABiosciences, Frederick, MD). The PCR array
contains a panel of 96 primer sets for a set of 84 relevant genes,
plus five housekeeping genes and three mRNA and PCR quality
controls. The cDNA template was mixed with ready-to-use RT￾qPCR Master. Aliquots of the mixture (25 ml) were introduced into
each well of the plate containing pre-dispensed gene specific
primer sets. We performed a real-time PCR using a two-step
cycling program as follows: 95uC, 10 minutes; 40 cycles for 95uC,
15 seconds and 60uC, 1 minute. The data obtained from RT￾IGF+HGF and Sca-1+

Effects Sca-1+
/CD312 Cell Co-culture on Stressor
(Hypoxia, H2O2 or TNFa) Induced HL-1 Cell Apoptosis
Sca-1+
/CD312 cells were plated onto fibronectin-gelatin￾coated plates or flasks and cultured in Claycomb medium
(Claycomb Laboratory, University of Louisiana) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml
streptomycin, 0.1 mM norepinephrine, and 2 mM L-glutamine as
previously described. Before being co-cultured, HL-1 cells were
labeled with Vybrant CFDA SE cell tracer kit (Molecular Probes,
Carlsbad, CA). Labeled HL-1 cells were extensively washed and
co-cultured with Sca-1+
/CD31– cells. The cell co-cultures were
then incubated for 24 h at 2% oxygen (hypoxia) or 21% oxygen
(normoxia) or treated with either 0.05 mmol/L H2O2, or 40 ng
TNF a for 12 hours while being maintained in a normoxic
medium. Apoptosis was assessed by staining with Hoechst 33342
(H33342) dye and then quantified by the percentage of apoptotic
nuclei (300 cells counted per sample) in the CFDA-labeled subset
by identifying cells with H33342 staining.
Animal Surgery and Cell Transplantation
Adult female BALB/c mice aged 10–12 weeks were employed
for this study. They were housed in trios or quartets with food and
tap water ad libitum. Myocardial infarction induced by left
anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) ligation and cell
transplantation is described as in detail in the supporting
information (Text S2).
Echocardiography
Echocardiography was performed 4 weeks after myocardial
infarction using an echocardiographic system equipped with a
high-resolution ultrasound biomicroscope (Vevo 660, VisualSo￾nics, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) with a 30-MHz transducer [26].
The details are described in the supporting information (Text S3).
Tissue Preparation for Light Microscopy, H&E, and TUNEL
Staining
Mouse hearts that had received LacZ transduced Sca-1+
/
CD31– cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and subjected
to b-galactosidase staining. Serial 8-mm-thick sections of each
tissue were cut onto slides. Apoptosis-related DNA fragmentation
was determined by the TUNEL assay using the ApopTag Plus
Peroxidase In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (Millipore, Temecula,
CA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Slides were
counterstained with hematoxylin for morphologic definition,
dehydrated in a series of ethanols and xylene, and mounted
under a glass coverslip. Specimens were examined and photo￾graphed with an Olympus BX51 light microscope. Images were
captured with the DPManager imaging software. On TUNEL
stained sections, apoptotic cells were enumerated by counting 100
cells in randomly selected infarction fields of a total of 10 sections.
One thousand cells were enumerated at each heart and the
apoptotic index was expressed as the percentage of apoptotic cells
per 100 cells enumerated.
Cell Engraftment Rates and Differentiation Status
The evaluation of cell engraftment rates and differentiation
status are described in detail in the supporting information (Text
S4).
BrdU In situ Hybridization
A 10 mg/ml solution of BrdU in sterile 1x DPBS was provided
for in vivo use. Intra-peritoneal injection of BrdU [200 ml (2 mg)]
was injected per day for 10 days following LAD ligation. Groups of
animals were sacrificed on day 3 and day 10 after myocardial
infarction, and analyzed for BrdU incorporation. BrdU incorpo￾ration was detected in cardiac tissues according to the manufac￾ture’s directions.
Analysis of Capillary Numbers
Capillaries were counted at a magnification of 20x using an
Olympus microscope (Olympus BX51/BX52). Infarct border
zones were examined for the number of CD31 antibody stained
capillaries. The quality of the computer analysis of capillary
numbers (NIH Image J program, http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij) was
checked against manual counting. The capillaries were counted in
blinded fashion on 50 sections (two fields per section, five sections
per heart, n = 6 for each group) in the peri-infarct zone.
Scar Size Measurements
Four weeks after the cell transplantation, the left ventricle was
excised, cut open from base to apex, and laid on a flat white paper.
Infarct size was calculated and expressed as a percentage of LV
surface area. Color digital images were obtained, and the ratio of
LV scar area to total LV surface area was evaluated with an image
software analysis system (NIH ImageJ program, http://rsb.info.
nih.gov/ij).
Statistical Analyses
Comparisons among three groups were analyzed using one-way
analysis of variance followed by Student-Newman-Keuls post hoc
tests (p,.05). Data are shown as mean 6 standard error.
Results
IGF+HGF Co-administration with Sca-1+
/CD312 Cells
Attenuates LV Structural and Functional Remodeling
more than does Cell Therapy Alone
Echocardiography performed four weeks after acute MI
revealed significantly higher values of LVEF and better preserved
LV geometry in the cell treated group as compared to the control
acute MI group (Figure 1) and IGF+HGF + cell therapy further
attenuated LV remodeling. LVEF was 19% in the untreated MI
group, 28% in the cell treated MI group and 39% in the IGF+
HGF plus cell treated MI group (n = 9, P,0.01 vs untreated and
cell treated MI groups). Of interest, the dose of both IGF and
HGF given to each heart ranged between ,5 and 7 ng/heart and
this dosage was comparable to that employed in several reports that
showed significant cardiac regeneration from endogenous CSCs
following growth factor administration [17–18]. We also found that
administration of IGF+HGF without cells was as effective as was cell
transplantation alone. However, combination therapy was more
effective than either individual intervention. Significant effects were
absent in a group transplanted with Sca-12/CD312 cells (data not
show), although the values in these groups did trend higher as
compared to untreated post-acute MI hearts (Figure 1). Increased
wall thicknesses were present in non-infarcted regions of treated
hearts (Figure 1) and scar sizes were also smaller in the treated MI
hearts (MI, 35.7+/20.02%; MI+IGF+HGF, 27.12+/20.09%;
MI+Sca-1+
/CD312cells, 24.9%+/20.02%; MI+IGF+HGF+Sca￾1+
/CD312cells, 19.9%+/20.02%; n = 6, p,0.05 vs all other MI
groups). It should be noted that no intervention was associated with

significant repopulation of the central regions of the scars with
cardiomyocytes; this contrasts with some reported data [17–18].
IGF+HGF Supplementation Increases the Long-term
Engraftment Rate, but Engrafted Cells Rarely
Differentiate into Cardiomyocytes
The absolute cell engraftment rate was determined by counting
the total number of DAPI and ?-galactosidase double positive cells
in the entire LV at three post-transplantation time points and then
dividing that number by the total number of donor cells injected.
IGF+HGF supplementation significantly improved the engraft￾ment rate at all three time points although by 4 weeks post￾transplantation, the numbers of engrafted cells were remarkably
decreased in both groups (Figure 2).
To determine the fate of engrafted cells, immunofluroscence
staining was performed with cardiogenic and endothelial markers.
In the Sca-1+
/CD312 cell transplanted group, about 2% of the
engrafted cells (i.e., b-galactosidase and DAPI positive) also stained
positive for the cardiogenic marker, troponin T (Figure 3). These
triple stained cells were only observed in the non-scar regions of
the LV (peri-infarct zone .. remote zone). Among the small
number of cells that co-stained positive for b-galactosidase and
troponin T, we also identified occasional N-cadherin immuno￾flurescence staining. The latter observation suggested the presence
of some gap junction formation between the differentiated
engrafted cells and adjacent cardiomyocytes (Figure 3). Although
the IGF+HGF plus Sca-1+
/CD312 cell group had more engrafted
cells that showed evidence of differentiation, this increase was
proportional to the increase of engrafted cell numbers in that
group. i.e., the likelihood that a given engrafted cell would
differentiate was not increased by the co-administration of growth
factors. These data, taken together with the fact that engrafted cell
numbers were quite low even in the combination therapy group
indicated that regeneration of cardiomyocytes from engrafted cells
did not account for the structural and functional improvement
observed in the Sca-1+
/CD312 cell treatment groups.
IGF+HGF Stimulated Endogenous Stem Cells Rarely
Differentiate into Cardiomyocytes
To determine if cardiomyocytes were regenerated from
endogenous stem cells in any group, BrdU in situ hybridization
and troponin T immunoflurorescence staining were performed.
Three days post-acute MI, we observed BrdU positive cells in the
hearts from all acute MI groups. Most of these cells were present in
the peri-infarct and infarct zones. Sca-1+
/CD312 cell transplan￾tation alone or IGF+HGF administration without cells increased
the number of BrdU positive cells (BrdU index) in the peri-infarct
and infarct zones compared to the untreated MI group (MI,
1.40+/20.08; MI+Sca-1+
/CD31, 2.44+/20.21; MI+IGF+HGF,
1.96+/20.14; n = 6, P,0.05). In contrast, IGF+HGF+Sca-1+
/
CD31 cell administration was associated with two-fold more BrdU
positive cells in the peri-infarct zone than present in the
aforementioned groups (4.70+/20.53, n = 6, P,0.01)
(Figure 4A). Importantly, we found almost no BrdU and troponin
T co-stained cells in any group 3 days after MI. At 10 days post￾MI, BrdU indices were further increased in all four groups (MI,
5.78+/20.27%; MI+IGF+HGF, 6.54+/20.89%; MI+Sca-1+
/
CD312 cell, 10.42+/20.95%; MI+IGF+HGF+Sca-1+
/CD312
cells, 14.25+/1.06%; n = 6, P,0.001 combined treatment vs
others). (Figure 4A, B, C). However, once again, we found that
only a small number of BrdU positive cells were co-stained with
troponin T on day 10 post MI (BrdU Troponin T Index: MI,
0.94+/20.22%). Sca-1+
/CD312 cell transplantation slightly
increased the number of these cells (Sca-1+

1.54+/20.27%, n = 5, P.0.05) compared with MI group. In the
IGF+HGF and combined treatment groups this effect was more
pronounced at 10 days (IGF+HGF, 1.76+/20.35%; IGF+HGF+

/CD312 cells; 2.71+/20.43%, n = 5, P,0.05 vs other
groups) (Figure 4D, E, F). Although these data do suggest that
IGF+HGF administration, with or without concomitant cell
injection, did stimulate some endogenous stem cells to differentiate
into cardiomyocytes; this phenomenon was infrequent and did not
likely make a substantial contribution to the therapeutic responses.
Effects of the Therapeutic Interventions on Peri-infarct
Zone Capillary Density
Two weeks after MI, immunofluorescence staining for CD31
antibody demonstrated the presence of more capillaries in the
peri-infarct regions of the treated hearts than were present in the
untreated MI hearts (Figure S1). The capillary numbers per
microscopic field (20x) in the non-IGF+HGF treated groups were
as follows: Control, 258.17+/26.76; MI, 132.33+/29.45; MI+
Sca-1+
/CD312 cells, 205.83+/29.19 (n = 6, all P,0.001 vs MI).
In the IGF+HGF treated groups, the values were: MI+IGF+HGF,
152+/29.3 (n = 6, P,0.05 vs MI); MI+IGF+HGF+Sca-1+
/
CD312, 260.1+/27.39 (n = 6, P,0.001 vs the all but the non￾MI Controls) (Figure S1). However, LacZ positive cells expressing
CD31 were rarely present in any of the cell treated groups. The
latter data indicate that differentiation or fusion based generation
of CD31+ cells from engrafted cells was minimal.
IGF+HGF Treatment Protects Stressed Sca-1+
/CD312 cells
In vitro
It is well known that IGF and HGF participate in the regulation
of cell survival and proliferation. To determine why IGF+HGF co￾administration increased the rate of cell engraftment, we asked if
IGF+HGF treatment might significantly inhibit apoptosis in Sca￾1+
/CD312 cells exposed to a known stressor in vitro. Flow
cytometry data analysis showed that survival of Sca-1+
/CD312
cells exposed to serum free medium for 48 hours was significantly
increased by treatment with IGF+HGF. In IGF+HGF treated
stressed cells, Annexin positive cell populations including early
(FITC staining positive) and late (FITC and PI double staining
positive) evidence of apoptosis remained at control levels (i.e., the
levels present in unstressed cells) as compared to the marked
elevations present in stressed cells not treated with growth factors.
Stressed cells showing early evidence of early apoptosis were less
frequent in treated group (7.36+/20.47%) than in the untreated
group (16.77+/20.91%) (n = 6, p,0.001)]. Similarly, stressed cells
showing late evidence of apoptosis were less frequent in the treated
(8.42+/21.25%) than the untreated group (31.65+/21.52%;
(n = 6, P,0.001). (Figure 5A, Figure S2). We also found that IGF+
HGF treatment caused more cells to enter the G1 and S phases of
the cell cycle in the treated group (Figure 5B, Figure S3).
In vitro experiments were also employed to test the hypothesis
that paracrine mediated suppression of apoptosis of native
cardiomyocytes post-acute MI in the in vivo heart might occur as
a consequence of exposure to Sca-1+
/CD312 cells. Therefore,
Sca-1+
/CD312 cells were co-cultured with mouse atrium derived
HL-1 cells with or without IGF+HGF supplementation. The
number of apoptotic nuclei of HL-1 cells was assessed by H33342
staining following exposure to different stressors (hypoxia, H2O2 or
TNF??. We found that both Sca-1+
/CD312 cell co-culture and
IGF+HGF supplementation decreased HL-1 cell apoptosis in all
stressor groups (Figure 5C). Moreover, combined cell and growth
factor co-culture was not more effective than observed with the
single interventions (data not shown). Hence, synergy between the
two interventions was absent at the concentrations of Sca-1+
/
CD312 cells and growth factors used in the co-culture studies.
IGF+HGF Decreases Apoptosis of Native Cardiomyocytes
in the Post-MI Heart
Consistent with the in vitro data, TUNEL staining of heart
tissues demonstrated Sca-1+
/CD312 cell transplantation alone
decreased the apoptotic indices in the peri-infarct zones 3 days
post-acute MI (MI, 25.62+/21.56%; MI+Sca-1+
/CD312 cell,
11.64+/21.21%; n = 6, P,0.001). IGF+HGF+Sca-1+
/CD312
cell treatment enhanced the anti-apoptotic effect of Sca-1+
/
CD312 cell transplantation further (6.67+/21.01%, n = 6, P,
0.05 vs Sca-1+
/CD312 alone) (Figure 6). Additionally, injection of
IGF+HGF alone decreased the apoptotic index 3 days after MI
(14.86+/23.24%; n = 6, P,0.05 compared to MI). These data
indicate that Sca-1+
/CD312cell transplantation 6 IGF+HGF
injection is protective with regard to in vivo cardiomyocyte
apoptosis but, unlike the case with the in vitro data, the combined
intervention was more effective than single interventions in the
in vivo heart.
mRNAs Profiling of Sca-1+
/CD312 and IGF+HGF Treated
Sca-1+
/CD312 Cells
Understanding the effects of IGF+HGF on gene expression
patterns in Sca-1+
/CD312 cells is crucial to understanding the
in vivo effects of combination therapy. Therefore, using growth
factor associated gene superarray analyses, we profiled both Sca￾1+
/CD312cells and IGF+HGF treated Sca-1+
/CD312 cells. The
Sca-1+
/CD312 cell mRNA expression patterns are shown in
Table 1; in this Table the growth factor associated mRNAs that
are highly expressed (defined as Ct value greater than 25) are
included. IGF+HGF treatment significantly altered the expression
patterns of a number of growth factor related mRNAs (Table 1,
Figure 7 and Figure S4). 6 mRNAs were up-regulated and 5
mRNAs were down-regulated following exposure of the cells to
IGF+HGF. These data suggest that one effect of exposure of Sca￾1+
/CD312 cells to IGF+HGF was increased expression of
mRNAs involved in the synthesis of growth factors and cell cycle
regulators. A well-known effect of ligand stimulation of growth
factor receptors is activation of Akt and its downstream signaling
pathways. We speculate that, as was shown to be the case for
marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells overexpressing Akt, that
the growth and trophic factor secretion by IGF+HGF treated Sca￾1+
/CD312 cells was also significantly increased [10,30–32]. More
detailed investigation of this issue is warranted.
Discussion
We have reported that intra-myocardial injection of mouse
heart derived Sca-1+
/CD312 cells at the time of induction of
myocardial injury attenuates the adverse structural remodeling
and functional declines consequent to the injury [26]. We also
found, using Sca-1 (heterozygous) knockout mice, that the severity
of post-acute MI LV remodeling was greater than that present in
wild type controls [27]. Taken together, these observations
suggested that both exogenous and endogenous myocardial Sca￾1+
/CD312 cells somehow contributed to the repair processes that
occur post-acute MI.
The present study explores the mechanisms underlying the
beneficial effects of transplantation of heart derived Sca-1+
/
CD312 cells and asks whether these effects can be amplified by the
co-administration of growth factors (IGF and HGF) at the time of
cell transplantation. The major findings are: 1. The beneficial

administered with cells; 5. Differentiation of endogenous stem cells
into cardiomyocytes, although enhanced by all interventions was
still minimal in all groups; 6. Sca-1+
/CD312 cell engraftment was
enhanced by co-administration of growth factors, but differenti￾ation of engrafted cells into cardiomyocytes or vascular cells was
infrequent; and 7. The in vitro exposure of Sca-1+
/CD312 cells to
IGF+HGF was associated with significant up-regulation or down￾regulation of the expression of mRNAs that are likely linked to
trophic factor generation/secretion by these cells.
Collectively, these data support previous reports that indicate
that the protective properties of transplanted stem cells can be
mediated via paracrine mechanisms [10,30–32]. Somewhat
surprisingly, in contrast to some previously published work,
cardiomyocyte regeneration from either transplanted or endoge￾nous stem cells did not appear to play a major role in the
therapeutic response [17–18,25]. Our data are also compatible
with the prevailing view that induction of vasculogenesis (and/or
preservation of native capillaries) is commonly associated with cell
transplantation (and/or growth factor administration) and that
increased capillary density contributes to the observed myocardial
protection.
IGF+HGF Added to Cell Transplantation Increases the
Rates of Cell Engraftment and Native Cardiomyocyte
Survival
It is well established that post-reperfusion oxidative stress,
inflammatory processes, and other adverse events that occur in the
injured region of the acutely infarcted heart contribute to the
occurrence of ischemic (necrotic) cellular death as well as to early
and late apoptosis of cardiomyocytes [33]. The adverse charac￾teristics of the tissue micro-environment are also presumed to
negatively affect the number of cells that persistently engraft
following direct myocardial transplantation early during the course
of an MI.
The administration of IGF+HGF at the time of cell transplan￾tation essentially doubled the number of engrafted cells present at
all time points examined. Hence, as previously reported, trophic
factor co-administration or genetic manipulation of donor cells to
enhance their rate of secretion of trophic factors enhances both
engraftment rates and therapeutic effects [10,30–32]. However,
despite the increased engraftment rate present in hearts also
receiving IGF+HGF, the late engraftment rates were low in all
groups. Moreover, the differentiation of engrafted cells or
endogenous stem cells into cardiomyocytes and vascular cells
was not frequent. It seems reasonable to conclude from these data
that the benefits of cell transplantaton 6 IGF+HGF were due to
paracrine mediated protection of native cardiomyocytes (and
perhaps vascular cells).
In humans, native cardiomyocyte apoptosis that occurs early
after acute MI is present mainly in the infarct and peri-infarct
border zones [34]. In the present study we found that all
treatments significantly inhibited the early phase of native
cardiomyocyte apoptosis (i.e., within 3 days post-MI) and that
these effects were most prominent in the combined treatment
group. This early anti-apoptotic effect was also observed in our
in vitro studies. For example, administration of IGF+HGF
decreased the severity of apoptosis present in Sca-1+
/CD312 cells
exposed to serum deprivation and co-culture of Sca-1+
/CD312
cells with atrium derived HL-1 cells significantly inhibited
apoptosis of these cells when they were challenged with stressors
such as hypoxia, TNFa or H2O2.
Of interest, HL-1 cell co-culture with Sca-1+
/CD312 cells
alone, culture with IGF+HGF alone and, the culture with cells
plus IGF+HGF all yielded comparable results. The latter findings
suggest that, in the in vitro studies, the ratio of Sca-1+
/CD312 to
HL-1 cells was high enough so that the effects of the presumed
secreted trophic factors were already optimal. Hence, additional
stimulation of the secretory output Sca-1+
/CD312cells and/or the
direct effects of the IGF+HGF on the HL-1 cells could not elicit
additional protection. In this regard, in our in vivo studies, the ratio
of engrafted cells to native cardiomyocytes was much lower than
that presents in the in vitro HL-1 cell studies and likely could not
elicit maximal protective effects. Hence, under in vivo conditions, it
is possible that the addition of IGF+HGF was able to increase
therapeutic effectiveness of cell transplantation by enhancing
trophic factor secretion by engrafted cells (as well as by direct
effects of IGF+HGF on injured cardiomyocytes).
Our in vivo and in vitro data are consistent with published reports
[10,30–32] that showed that the early anti-apoptotic effects of cell
therapy occurred in less than 3 days, preceded the later increase in
myocardial capillary density. These authors also showed that
trophic factors were released by their transplant cells and that
over-expression of Akt in these cells was associated with a marked
increase in their rates of secretion of trophic factors, and, thereby,
of their therapeutic effectiveness [10].
Effects of Interventions on Infarct Border Zone Capillary
Density
All therapeutic interventions significantly attenuated the reduc￾tion in capillary density that occurred in the infarct border zone of
untreated hearts. In fact, the combination of cell and trophic factor
administration completely prevented this fall in capillary density.
Of interest, the response to trophic factor injection alone tended to
be smaller than that to cell therapy alone. Because, there was only
a small direct contribution of engrafted or endogenous stem cells
(via differentiation) to the increased capillary numbers, we
conclude that the increase of capillary density can also be
attributed to paracrine mechanisms acting on endogenous vascular
cell precursors.

The Low Rate of Generation of New Cardiomyocytes
Present in this Acute MI Model is Comparable to that
Reported in Many, but not All Earlier studies
Some published reports have indicated that IGF+HGF admin￾istration (alone) to newly infarcted rodent and dog hearts did result
in significant cardiomyocyte generation from endogenous CSCs
[17–18,25]. However, even in the combined treatment group,
there was evidence of only modest cardiomyocyte regeneration
from either transplanted or endogenous stem cells. We have no
obvious explanation for why our results differ from some
previously reported results.
Summary
The major effects of the Sca-1+
/CD312 cell transplantation
(with or without added IGF+HGF) are paracrine in nature. The
data supporting this view include: 1. decreased rates of apoptosis of
injured cardiomyocytes, 2. preservation of capillary density in the
peri-infarct zone of the LV which improved perfusion capacity
and presumably cardiomyocyte contractile function, and 3.
possible enhancement of suggested beneficial interactions between
the vasculature and cardiomyocytes [35]. It is possible that IGF+
HGF administration might be a useful adjuvant to therapeutic cell
transplantation at the time of acute revascularization therapy for
acute MI. Moreover, it may be that the co-administration of IGF+
HGF with Sca-1+
/CD312 cells during a later phase of MI
recovery might be associated with more significant cardiomyocyte
regeneration [6,36].
