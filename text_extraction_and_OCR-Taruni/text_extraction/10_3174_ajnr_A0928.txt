Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome,
Part 1: Fundamental Imaging and Clinical
Features
W.S. Bartynski SUMMARY: Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a neurotoxic state coupled with
a unique CT or MR imaging appearance. Recognized in the setting of a number of complex conditions
(preeclampsia/eclampsia, allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, organ transplantation, autoimmune
disease and high dose chemotherapy) the imaging, clinical and laboratory features of this toxic state
are becoming better elucidated. This review summarizes the basic and advanced imaging features of
PRES, along with pertinent features of the clinical and laboratory presentation and available histopa￾thology. Many common imaging/clinical/laboratory observations are present among these patients,
despite the perception of widely different associated clinical conditions.
I
nitially recognized in association with eclampsia, cyclospor￾ine after transplantation, and in the setting of severe hyper￾tension, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome
(PRES) has become synonymous with a unique pattern of
brain vasogenic edema seen in the setting of neurotoxicity.1-14
On CT or MR imaging studies, the edema is often widespread
but predominates in the parietal and occipital regions, likely
leading Hinchey et al15 to suggest the “posterior” description.
A substantial experience with PRES has evolved; and
though more widely recognized, controversy still exists as to
the mechanism responsible for the brain edema. Specifically,
what is the role of hypertension and is the edema related to
hyperperfusion or hypoperfusion? In this review, the funda￾mental clinical and imaging features of PRES will be empha￾sized with controversial issues to follow.
Imaging Patterns in PRES
At CT/MR imaging, the brain typically demonstrates focal re￾gions of symmetric hemispheric edema (Fig 1A, -B). The pa￾rietal and occipital lobes are most commonly affected, fol￾lowed by the frontal lobes, the inferior temporal-occipital
junction, and the cerebellum.16-18 Lesion confluence may de￾velop as the extent of edema increases. MR diffusion-weighted
imaging (DWI) was instrumental in establishing and consis￾tently demonstrating that the areas of abnormality represent
vasogenic edema.19-24 The edema usually completely reverses.
The basic PRES pattern resembles the brain watershed
zones, with the cortex and subcortical and deep white matter
involved to varying degrees.12,14,16,25,26 Three hemispheric
pattern variants may be encountered with similar frequency
(holohemispheric [Fig 1], superior frontal sulcal, and primary
parietal-occipital).27 These demarcate lateral hemispheric
blood supply (middle cerebral artery [MCA]) and medial
hemispheric supply (anterior cerebral artery [ACA], posterior
cerebral artery [PCA]) and further reflect the junctional/wa￾tershed nature of PRES.
Characteristic lesion locations such as the inferior tempo￾ral-occipital junction, superior frontal sulcus, and parietal/
occipital region likely represent junctional expression between
second-order branches or distal hemispheric branches.16 Lin￾early oriented focal deep white matter involvement may rep￾resent expression of PRES in the deep (intrahemispheric) wa￾tershed.27 A continuum is noted between diminutive and
extensive expression of PRES; and partial, asymmetric, or
mixed forms of these patterns may be encountered.
Focal/patchy areas of PRES vasogenic edema may also be
seen in the basal ganglia, brain stem, and deep white matter
(external/internal capsule).20,27-31 When they accompany
hemispheric or cerebellar PRES, it is easy to recognize these
areas as companion lesions. Present in isolation or when the
hemispheric pattern is incompletely expressed (partial/asym￾metric), the diagnosis of PRES can be challenging.27,32 If cer￾ebellar or brain stem involvement are extensive, hydrocepha￾lus and brain stem compression may occur.33-35
Focal areas of restricted diffusion (likely representing in￾farction or tissue injury with cytotoxic edema) are uncommon
(11%–26%) and may be associated with an adverse out￾come.20,21 Hemorrhage (focal hematoma, isolated sulcal/sub￾arachnoid blood, or protein) is seen in approximately 15% of
patients.16,27,32
Basic Clinical Features of Neurotoxicity with PRES
Patients at risk for PRES are summarized in the Table. Neuro￾toxicity with characteristic watershed CT/MR imaging fea￾tures was initially noted in eclampsia, allogeneic bone marrow
transplantation (allo-BMT), solid organ transplantation
(SOT), and in association with severe hypertension. With sim￾ilar clinical/imaging presentation recognized the mid 1990s,
additional associations were noted (autoimmune conditions,
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and medical renal
disease), and the term “PRES” was introduced.15,20,22 PRES is
seen with unique or high-dose cancer chemotherapy (Table)
and has recently been associated with infection, sepsis, and
shock.36Additional considerations have been suggested in nu￾merous case reports as reviewed in the Table.
Clinical/Laboratory Characteristics in PRES
Clinical symptoms at toxicity are broad but include headache,
vision change, paresis, hemianopsia, nausea, and altered men￾tation.37,38 Symptoms may develop over several days or may
be recognized only in the acute setting. Generalized seizures

are common and coma may develop. In approximately 70%–
80% of patients, moderate-to-severe hypertension is ob￾served. Toxicity blood pressure is normal or only minimally
elevated in 20%–30% of patients in eclampsia, allo-BMT, and
most large reported PRES series.11,15,17,22,27,39-42
Best studied in preeclampsia/eclampsia, laboratory evi￾dence of endothelial injury is often present with platelet con￾sumption (thrombocytopenia) and evidence of red cell frag￾mentation (schistocyte formation, increase in lactate
dehydrogenase [LDH]).43,44 Developing hypertension in pre￾eclampsia is related to systemic vasoconstriction with accompa￾nying reduced intravascular volume and hemoconcentration.
Renal dysfunction with proteinuria and hypomagnesemia oc￾cur; systemic edema develops due to a combination of altered
endothelial function and reduced oncotic pressure. Hepatic
ischemia may lead to liver dysfunction and, when severe, he￾molysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets (HELLP)
syndrome.
In infection/sepsis/shock–associated PRES, a clinical pat￾tern consistent with systemic inflammatory response syn￾drome develops with evidence of multiple organ dysfunction
syndrome (MODS), including alteration of coagulation
(thrombocytopenia), liver function (increased bilirubin), re￾nal function (increased creatinine), pulmonary function, and
cardiovascular instability.36
Similar features may develop in patients after allo-BMT. The
effects of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) are managed by im￾mune suppression with cyclosporine or tacrolimus (FK-506).
Cyclosporine can injure the endothelium.45,46At toxicity, diffuse
endothelial dysfunction is often present, termed “bone marrow
transplant thrombotic microangiopathy,” with development of
significant schistocyte counts (exceeding 10% when severe) and
marked elevation of LDH.16,17,47 A MODS pattern can develop
with systemic or pulmonary edema and ischemic hepatic dys￾function, similar to preeclampsia.48
Major PRES-Associated Clinical “Conditions”
Preeclampsia/Eclampsia. The association of PRES with
toxemia of pregnancy is well established.1-3,5,21,24,26,49,50 Pre￾eclampsia develops in approximately 5% of pregnancies and
eclampsia, in approximately 1 in 3000 births with current
management.43,44 Eclampsia develops before gestation in 50%
of patients, interpartum in 25%, and within 48 hours of deliv￾ery in 25%. Although most women are hypertensive at toxic￾ity, blood pressure is reported as normal or only minimally
elevated in 23% of patients.39 The placenta is thought to be the
primary cause of toxemia, with placenta removal and fetal
delivery considered curative.43,44
“Delayed Eclampsia” (PRES within several weeks after de￾livery) can occur, and the clinical presentation is often confus￾Fig 1. The patient is a 28-year-old man with a history of
alcohol abuse and drug use, presenting with a necrotic
pneumonia and empyema growing Pseudomonas and Kleb￾siella species. He developed altered mentation and asym￾metric neurologic findings on examination. Blood pressure at
toxicity fluctuated between 130/100 mm Hg and 130/77 mm
Hg. A and B, Axial MR images (fluid-attenuated inversion
recovery) demonstrate extensive vasogenic edema in the
frontal lobes (arrows), parietal region (curved arrows), occip￾ital lobes (open arrows), and temporal lobes (arrowheads),
bilaterally, consistent with PRES. The edema distribution
clearly separates medial (ACA and PCA) from lateral (MCA)
hemispheric regions typical of the holohemispheric PRES
pattern. Cerebellar involvement was also present (not
shown). C, Lateral view of the left internal carotid artery
injection with left and right ACA opacification. Areas of
vessel dilation and constriction are noted in the secondary
and tertiary branches of both medial hemispheric vessels (left
[arrows] and right [arrowheads] ACAs) and lateral hemi￾spheric vessels (left MCA [curved arrows]) consistent with
vasculopathy. D, Lateral view of the vertebral artery CA
injection demonstrates a string-of-beads appearance (arrow￾heads) and areas of vasodilation/vasoconstriction (arrows) in
parietal branches of the PCA. E, Oblique 3D TOF MRA
reconstructed images of the posterior circulation demon￾strate areas of focal vasodilation and vasoconstriction in the PCAs bilaterally (arrows), consistent with vasculopathy, similar to the vertebral artery CA appearance. Posterior inferior
cerebellar artery (arrowheads) irregularity is also present.

ing.4,51 Blood pressure may be normal or mildly elevated, se￾vere headache is common, and conventional angiography is
often performed to exclude intracranial aneurysm. In a re￾cently reported case, delayed eclampsia appeared to have been
associated with retained placental fragments.52 PRES has also
been reported 3 weeks following resection and chemotherapy
for hydatidiform mole.53
Infection/Sepsis/Shock. In infection, sepsis, and shock–
associated PRES, gram-positive organisms predominate, and
in 40% of patients, toxicity blood pressure is normal or only
minimally increased.36 At imaging, vasogenic edema is greater
in normotensive patients and lower in severely hypertensive
patients; and at MR angiography (MRA), reversible “vascu￾lopathy” (diffuse/focal vasoconstriction) or vessel pruning is
noted.36 Recent reports note PRES in the setting of post-strep￾tococcal glomerulonephritis, Henoch-Schonlein purpura,
and infection-induced hypercoagulable state.54-56
Autoimmune Disease. PRES has been identified in pa￾tients with systemic lupus erythematosus, Wegener’s granulo￾matosis, systemic sclerosis (scleroderma, Fig 2), and polyar￾teritis nodosa.15,20,22,27,57-60 Detailed accounts of the clinical
circumstances surrounding PRES in association with autoim￾mune disease are infrequent.57-60 Patients are commonly
managed with intermittent doses of immunosuppression (cy￾clophosphamide, cyclosporine) for disease control.
Cancer Chemotherapy. PRES is usually encountered after
high-dose multidrug cancer therapy, typically in hematopoi￾etic malignancies.61-64 A variety of cancer chemotherapeutic
drugs have also been noted in association with PRES (Table).
Transplantation. PRES is well recognized in the setting of
bone marrow or stem cell transplantation.11,17,18,65-68 The in￾cidence of PRES after allo-BMT using myeloablative marrow
preconditioning and cyclosporine immune suppression is ap￾proximately 7%–9% and appears to vary with a precondition￾ing regimen.11,67,69A greater frequency (16%) is reported with
higher dose myeloablative regimens, and a lower frequency
(3%) is noted with nonmyeloablative preconditioning.65,69
PRES occurs most commonly in the first month after allo￾BMT, with the remainder during the subsequent year after
transplantation.11,40,67,69 Reported incidence of PRES with ta￾crolimus immune suppression appears variable.66,68 A high
incidence of GVHD is also noted in patients with allo-BMT
PRES, and a GVHD effect has been suggested.68,70-72Variation
in cyclosporine toxicity with human leukocyte antigen match
has been noted, and the rate of tacrolimus-associated PRES
appears to increase with the degree of graft mismatch.66,67
PRES is also noted after SOT.9,12,13,34,40,73-80 The reported
incidence of PRES after SOT varies between 0.4% and 6%.78,81
The onset of PRES varies among subtypes but tends to occur
earlier after liver transplantation.81 Systemic hypertension was
found to be common in patients who develop PRES after renal
transplantation but uncommon after heart, lung, or liver
transplantation.77,81,82 In our experience, transplant rejection
and infection often accompany PRES in SOT.83 After liver
transplantation, PRES typically occurs early (within 2 months
after transplantation), blood pressure tends to be normal, and
the extent of brain edema is significant. In contrast, patients
with kidney transplantation appear to develop PRES late after
transplantation, are severely hypertensive, and have signifi￾cantly less brain edema.83
After transplantation, several PRES-related risks coexist.
The immune-suppressive drugs cyclosporine/tacrolimus (FK￾506) inhibit T-cell activation, proliferation, and interleukin-2
production through inhibition of the calcineurin path￾way.84,85 These drugs are associated with low-level neurotox￾icity in 10%–40% of patients (tremors, anxiety, psychiatric
dysfunction).37,86 Immunosuppressant blood levels do not
appear to correlate with severe neurotoxicity or PRES, but
immunosuppressant discontinuation or switch usually results
in clinical improvement.11,37,67,69,77,86,87 Cyclosporine can in￾duce endothelial injury/dysfunction leading to enhanced va￾soconstrictive effects (increased endothelin and thrombox￾Conditions at risk for PRES

ane, decreased nitric oxide and prostacycline), increased
sympathetic activation, and coagulation effects.37,45-47,84,88
Immune challenge from the transplant (transplant rejection,
GVHD), effects of chemotherapy (preconditioning), and the
risks of infection in the immunosuppressed state may further
contribute to toxicity. Clearly, a balance exists between ade￾quate immunosuppression and infection risk.
Hypertension. PRES is commonly seen in the setting of
hypertension. The upper limits of autoregulation are not typ￾ically reached, but moderate-to-severe hypertension is seen in
approximately 75% of patients with PRES. Often termed “hy￾pertensive encephalopathy,” the reported imaging patterns
can vary.6-8,35,89-93 Areas of deep white matter abnormality
have been noted, which may overlap with lacunar disease and
may relate to the known histologic findings in hyperten￾sion.8,93,94 Hemispheric PRES patterns have been reported as
well as isolated reversible brain stem and cerebellar edema,
occasionally resulting in obstructive hydrocephalus.35
Recurrent PRES
Recurrent PRES has been anecdotally reported in severe hy￾pertension and after allo-BMT.66,80 In a recent reported series,
recurrent PRES was noted in 3 (3.8%) of 78 patients and was
associated with sickle-cell disease with infection, allo-BMT
with infection, or atypical autoimmune disease and possible
viral infection.95 Recurrent eclampsia is well recognized with a
reported incidence of 2% of live births.96
Histopathology in PRES
Histologic evaluation of PRES is uncommon and often obtained
late in the course of complex systemic disease. Biopsy/autopsy
obtained during acute toxicity demonstrates vasogenic edema,
paralleling observations on DWI.17,76,97-99 Activated/reactive as￾trocytes, scattered macrophages, and lymphocytes have been of￾ten noted without inflammation, ischemia, or neuronal damage.
Late autopsy studies have generally demonstrated evidence of de￾myelination and myelin pallor along with evidence of ischemia,
neuronal anoxic damage, laminar necrosis, or older hemorrhage
in the white matter and cortex.11,13,17,100
Evidence of acute and chronic vessel injury has been de￾scribed in late autopsy studies with identification of intimal
thickening, segmental vessel narrowing, intimal dissection,
and organized thrombi.11,101 Acute vascu￾lopathy has also been described in a patient
with a liver transplant with vessel inflammation
and adjacent deep basal ganglia and periven￾tricular infarction.102
Advanced Imaging in PRES
Cerebral Blood Vessels in PRES
At catheter angiography (CA), diffuse vasoconstriction, focal
vasoconstriction, vasodilation, and even a string-of-beads ap￾pearance have been noted in PRES, consistent with what is
typically described as vasospasm or arteritis (Fig 1C,
-D).2,4,14,51,54,103,104 Reported blood pressure in most of these
patients demonstrated moderate but not severe hypertension
(mean arterial pressure 130 mm Hg). CA in PRES is typically
performed in eclampsia, delayed eclampsia, and after cancer
chemotherapy, usually in the setting of a clinical presentation
in which aneurysm is suspected.
At MRA using a 3D time of flight (TOF) technique, pat￾terns resembling vasculopathy have been noted, with vessel
irregularity consistent with focal vasoconstriction/vasodila￾tion and diffuse vasoconstriction (Fig 1E).17,36,60,95,103,105-108
When performed, repeat MRA often demonstrates reversal of
the vasculopathy. In normotensive patients, vessels may ap￾pear normal or demonstrate pruning of distal intracranial
branches, in particular the PCAs.36
Abnormal internal carotid or vertebral arteries have, on occa￾sion, been noted in PRES, with intimal irregularity resembling
fibromuscular disease demonstrated by CA in delayed eclampsia
and dissection noted in PRES onMRA.51,109These CA/MRA fea￾tures reflect previously described vessel histologic observations.
MR venography has tended to be normal in PRES.107
Cerebral Blood Flow in PRES
The state of brain blood flow in PRES remains controversial
(Review, Part 2). Vasoconstriction seen by CA in early studies
prompted the authors to postulate that reduced brain perfu￾sion led to the imaging features. In contrast, animal studies
suggested that experimentally induced hypertension above the
autoregulatory limit (mean arterial pressure 150 –160 mm
Hg) led to hyperperfusion, breakdown of the blood-brain bar￾rier, and hemispheric edema.
Hyperperfusion was suggested in a single patient with
PRES and Wegener’s in an early study using technetium
Tc99m-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (Tc99m-HM￾PAO) single-photon emission CT (SPECT), with a second pa￾tient (eclamptic) demonstrating variable radiotracer distribu￾tion.18 In a later study, increased Tc99m-HMPAO SPECT
activity suggesting hyperperfusion was reported in a single pa￾tient with a molar pregnancy and eclampsia.110 In patients

severe hypertension (190/110 mm Hg), and acute renal failure,
with altered mental status that progressed to seizure. A, Axial

with hypoperfusion.

with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and vasospasm,
Tc99m-HMPAO studies demonstrated patterns of variable
perfusion.111 Increased radiopharmaceutical activity in
Tc99m-HMPAO brain studies has been noted in many cir￾cumstances associated with stroke but remains
controversial.112
In contrast, watershed hypoperfusion has been demon￾strated by using Tc99m-HMPAO SPECT in a large series of
women with eclampsia, with focal hypoperfusion also noted
after chemotherapy and in autoimmune disease (Fig 2).63,113
Reduced perfusion has also been demonstrated using MR per￾fusion (MRP) in PRES (Fig 3).103,114,115Cortex and white mat￾ter relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) has been shown to
be reduced moderately in areas of PRES (average, 65%), when
compared with normal uninvolved regions in 2 studies.103,115
Comparing anterior-to-posterior hemispheric flow, Brubaker
et al114 found that MRP has also demonstrated significant pos￾terior brain hypoperfusion with increased mean transit time,
reduced CBV, and reduced cerebral blood flow.114 Critical
cortex hypoperfusion (12.2 mL/100 g brain per minute) has
been demonstrated by stable xenon CT after blood pressure
reduction in a child with hypertensive encephalopathy and
PRES, which partially reversed with re-established moderate
hypertension (mean arterial pressure, 114 mm Hg).116
Proton MR Spectroscopy in PRES
Reduced N-acetylaspartate:choline and N-acetylaspartate:cre￾atinine ratios have been described by MR spectroscopy in re￾gions of PRES vasogenic edema as well as in unaffected re￾gions.107,117,118 Quantitative metabolite assessment in 2
patients demonstrated an absolute reduction of metabolite
concentration (considered a dilution effect from vasogenic
edema), which corrected in 1 patient on follow-up MR spec￾troscopy.117 Abnormal metabolite ratios may persist.107 Lac￾tate has been reported in PRES, and when accompanied by
vasoconstriction, a contribution from ischemia has been
suggested.42,107
The Controversy over the Mechanism of PRES
The cause of PRES is not yet understood. Hypertension with
failed autoregulation and hyperperfusion remains a popular
consideration for the developing brain edema.18,92,119,120 Al￾ternatively, endothelial dysfunction/injury, hypoperfusion,
and vasoconstriction may lead to al￾tered integrity of the blood-brain
barrier.4,121,122
Although commonly cited, several
problems exist with the hypertension/hy￾perperfusion theory. PRES is seen in the absence of hyperten￾sion in 20%–40% of patients.17,27,36,39 In the remainder,
though some degree of hypertension is present, reported
blood pressure does not typically reach the limit of autoregu￾lation (mean arterial pressure 150 –160 mm Hg).123 Also,
several recent studies have noted less vasogenic edema in se￾verely hypertensive patients when compared with normoten￾sive patients, contrary to the expected result if severe hyper￾tension with failed autoregulation was the mechanism behind
PRES.36,103 The biologic observations (strengths/weaknesses)
related to both theories will be reviewed in detail in Part 2.
Conclusion
PRES develops in patients with complex systemic conditions
such as eclampsia, after transplantation, in infection/sepsis/
shock and autoimmune disease, and after cancer chemother￾apy. Hypertension is absent in 25% of patients and, when
present, does not typically reach the level of failed autoregula￾tion. The imaging appearance typically demonstrates symmet￾ric vasogenic edema with several characteristic patterns, gen￾erally representing a distribution between lateral and medial
cerebral arterial branches (ie, a watershed distribution). Vas￾culopathy is commonly identified by CA or MRA, and most
studies have demonstrated reduced brain perfusion in regions
of PRES. The mechanism responsible for the imaging appear￾ance remains unclear and controversial.
