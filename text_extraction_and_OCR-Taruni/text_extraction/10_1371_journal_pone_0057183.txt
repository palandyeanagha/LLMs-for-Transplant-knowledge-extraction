Abstract
Background: The relationship between non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and atrial fibrillation (AF) in type 2 diabetes
is currently unknown. We examined the relationship between NAFLD and risk of incident AF in people with type 2 diabetes.
Methods and Results: We prospectively followed for 10 years a random sample of 400 patients with type 2 diabetes, who
were free from AF at baseline. A standard 12-lead electrocardiogram was undertaken annually and a diagnosis of incident
AF was confirmed in affected participants by a single cardiologist. At baseline, NAFLD was defined by ultrasonographic
detection of hepatic steatosis in the absence of other liver diseases. During the 10 years of follow-up, there were 42 (10.5%)
incident AF cases. NAFLD was associated with an increased risk of incident AF (odds ratio [OR] 4.49, 95% CI 1.6–12.9,
p,0.005). Adjustments for age, sex, hypertension and electrocardiographic features (left ventricular hypertrophy and PR
interval) did not attenuate the association between NAFLD and incident AF (adjusted-OR 6.38, 95% CI 1.7–24.2, p = 0.005).
Further adjustment for variables that were included in the 10-year Framingham Heart Study-derived AF risk score did not
appreciably weaken this association. Other independent predictors of AF were older age, longer PR interval and left
ventricular hypertrophy.
Conclusions: Our results indicate that ultrasound-diagnosed NAFLD is strongly associated with an increased incidence of AF
in patients with type 2 diabetes even after adjustment for important clinical risk factors for AF.

Introduction
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has reached epidemic
proportions and is the most common cause of chronic liver disease
in clinical practice [1,2]. The prevalence of NAFLD has been
estimated to be in the 20 to 35% range in the general adult
population in Western countries and is almost certainly increasing
[1,2]. Compared with nondiabetic subjects, patients with type 2
diabetes seem to be at increased risk for developing NAFLD and
certainly have a higher risk for developing advanced fibrosis and
cirrhosis. It has been estimated that approximately 60 to 70% of
persons with type 2 diabetes have some form of NAFLD [1–3].
To date, growing clinical evidence indicates that NAFLD is
linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) both in
patients without diabetes and in those with type 2 diabetes [3,4].
Recent studies also suggest that NAFLD is associated with early
left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction, independently of
hypertension and other cardiometabolic risk factors [5–7]. More
recently, two large community-based cohort studies that used
serum levels of gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) to diagnose
NAFLD have shown that this disease is associated with an
increased incidence of heart failure, independently of several
established risk factors [8,9].
In parallel, it is well recognized that atrial fibrillation (AF) is the
most common sustained arrhythmia and its prevalence is expected
to rise substantially over the next few decades because of ageing
population and improvements in cardiovascular treatments
[10,11]. The prevalence of AF increases from about 1% in
individuals less than 55 years of age to about 10–12% in those
older than 80 years of age [10]. Along with older age, many
pathologic conditions such as obesity, hypertension, coronary
heart disease, heart failure and valvular heart disease have been
reported to be among the strongest risk factors for new-onset AF
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 February 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e57183

[12–14], which is a disease associated with high rates of
hospitalisation and death [10,15].
Thus, although NAFLD correlates with abnormalities in cardiac
structure and function and shares with AF multiple cardiometa￾bolic risk factors, there is currently a lack of available information
on the relationship between NAFLD and AF in people with type 2
diabetes, a group of individuals in which these two diseases are
highly prevalent. Very recently, the Framingham Heart Study
investigators have reported an independent association between
mildly elevated serum transaminase concentrations, a surrogate
marker of NAFLD, and increased risk of new-onset AF in the
community [16].
The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that NAFLD as
diagnosed by ultrasonography (the most widely used imaging test
for diagnosing hepatic steatosis) predicts subsequent development
of incident AF in people with type 2 diabetes.
Materials and Methods
Participants
In this exploratory analysis, we followed for 10 years a sample of
400 patients with type 2 diabetes, who were clinically free from AF
at baseline. As detailed in Figure 1, these participants were selected
by a simple random sampling technique (using a random number
generator) from the whole cohort (n = 1,718) of outpatients with
type 2 diabetes attending the diabetes clinic at the ‘Sacro Cuore’
Hospital of Negrar (Verona) during 2000–2001, after excluding
subjects who did not meet the inclusion criteria for the study. In
particular, we excluded (1) patients who had a history of AF or
atrial flutter, (2) those who were taking any anti-arrhythmic drugs,
(3) those who had a history of previous moderate-to-severe aortic
and mitral valvular disease, hyperthyroidism, malignancy and end￾stage renal disease, (4) those who had known causes of chronic
liver disease (i.e., alcohol-induced or drug-induced liver disease,
viral hepatitis, hemochromatosis or other known causes of liver
diseases), and (5) those with missing liver ultrasound or laboratory
data.
The sample size of this study was calculated with the specific
aim of constructing a confidence interval around the incidence
proportion of AF in patients with analogous characteristics. In a
similar patient cohort the proportion with AF has been estimated
to be approximately 7% [14]. Therefore, with a precision of 2.5%
and a confidence interval of 95%, we calculated that a sample size
of 400 patients would be needed, taking also into account a
cumulative proportion of losses to follow-up of 20%. Thus, a
sample size of 400 patients from a population of 1,718 patients
produces a 95% confidence interval equal to the population
proportion, plus or minus 2.5%, when the estimated proportion of
patients with AF is 7% and the expected cumulative proportion of
losses to follow-up is 20%. As specified in the Results section (1st
paragraph), the random sampling procedure allowed us to select a
sample of 400 patients that was well representative of the 1,718
type 2 diabetic patients initially eligible.
All participants were periodically seen at the diabetes clinic
(every 6–12 months) for medical examinations of glycemic
control, chronic diabetic complications and routine 12-lead
electrocardiograms (ECG). The ascertainment at the end of the
follow-up period (January 2011) for the whole sample was
100%.
The local ethics committee of the ‘Sacro Cuore’ Hospital of
Negrar approved the study and all participants gave their
written informed consent for participation in this medical
research.
Clinical and Laboratory Data
BMI was calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by the
square of height in meters. Blood pressure was measured in
duplicate by a physician with a mercury sphygmomanometer (at
the right upper arm using an appropriate cuff size) after patient
had been seated quietly for at least 5 minutes. Subjects were
considered to have hypertension if their blood pressure was $140/
90 mmHg or if they were taking any anti-hypertensive drugs.
Information on medical history, alcohol consumption, smoking
and use of medications was obtained from all patients by
interviews during medical examinations.
Venous blood was drawn in the morning after an overnight fast.
Serum liver enzymes, lipids and other biochemical blood
measurements were determined by standard laboratory proce￾dures (DAX 96; Bayer Diagnostics, Milan, Italy). Most partici￾pants (92% of total) had serum liver enzyme levels within the
reference ranges in our laboratory. No participants had seropos￾itivity for viral hepatitis B and C. LDL-cholesterol was calculated
by the Friedewald’s equation. HbA1c was measured by an
automated high-performance liquid chromatography analyzer
(HA-8140; Menarini Diagnostics, Florence, Italy); the upper limit
of normal for our laboratory was 5.8%. Albuminuria was
measured by an immuno-nephelometric method on a morning
spot urine sample and expressed as the albumin-to-creatinine
ratio.
At baseline, the diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)
was made by a single cardiologist on the basis of a resting 12-lead
ECG according to Sokolow-Lyon’s voltage criteria (SV1+RV5 or
RV6$3.5 mV) and/or Cornell’s voltage criteria (SV3+RaVL
.2.0 mV in women and .2.8 mV in men, respectively) [17]. In
all participants the electrocardiographic PR interval was also
recorded. Coronary heart disease (CHD) was defined as a
documented history of myocardial infarction, angina, coronary
artery bypass grafts, percutaneous trans-luminal coronary angio￾plasty or typical ECG abnormalities (according to the Minnesota
code). The history of previous congestive heart failure and mild
valvular heart disease were confirmed by reviewing medical
records of the hospital, including diagnostic symptoms patterns,
echocardiograms and results of other laboratory exams. Chronic
kidney disease (CKD) was defined as the presence of abnormal
albuminuria (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio $30 mg/g) and/or
glomerular filtration rate ,60 ml/min/1.73 m2 as estimated by
the four-variable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD)
study equation [18].
Liver and Carotid Ultrasonography
At baseline, hepatic ultrasonography was performed in all
patients by a single experienced radiologist, who was blinded to
the participants’ details. Hepatic steatosis was diagnosed on the
basis of characteristic sonographic features, i.e., evidence of diffuse
hyper-echogenicity of the liver relative to the kidneys, ultrasound
beam attenuation and poor visualization of intra-hepatic vessel
borders and diaphragm [19]. It is known that ultrasonography has
good sensitivity and specificity for detecting moderate and severe
hepatic steatosis (,90–95%), but its sensitivity is reduced when the
hepatic fat infiltration upon liver biopsy is ,33% [19]. Semi￾quantitative sonographic scoring for the degree of hepatic steatosis
(mild, moderate or severe) was not available in this study. Grading
of hepatic fat content using ultrasonography has been used in
previous studies but remains somewhat subjective [19].
The presence of atherosclerotic plaques (i.e., stenosis of 30%
or more) at the level of either internal or common carotid
arteries was diagnosed by echo-Doppler scanning, which was
NAFLD and Atrial Fibrillation in Diabetes
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 February 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e57183

performed by a single specialist physician, who was blind to
subjects’ characteristics.
Diagnosis of Incident Atrial Fibrillation
At baseline, all participants were free from AF as documented
by a standard 12-lead ECG. A 24-hour Holter monitor
examination was not routinely performed either at baseline or
during the follow-up period. During the follow-up, participants
were diagnosed with AF if AF or atrial flutter was present on a
standard ECG that was obtained either from a routine clinic
examination in our diabetes clinic (i.e., a 12-lead resting ECG was
performed annually in all participants) or from reviewing hospital
and physician charts from all participants. The diagnosis of AF
was confirmed in affected participants by an experienced
cardiologist, who was blinded to clinical characteristics of
participants, including NAFLD status.
Statistical Analysis
Data are expressed as means 6 SD, medians (interquartile
range) or percentages. Skewed variables (serum liver enzymes,
triglycerides and diabetes duration) were transformed using
natural logarithmic transformation to improve normality prior to
analysis. The unpaired-t test (for continuous variables) and the chi￾squared test or the Fisher’s exact test when appropriate (for
categorical variables) were used to analyze the differences among
the characteristics of the participants at the time of enrollment in
relation to their status of either future development of AF (Table 1)
or presence of NAFLD at baseline (Table 2). Binary logistic
regression analysis was used to study the association between
NAFLD and incident AF (Table 3). We preferred to perform a
logistic regression analysis instead of a time-dependent Cox
regression analysis since in presence of a small number of events
a time-to-event type of analysis, such as Cox regression, is more
susceptible to bias than binary logistic regression analysis when
adjusted for predictor variables since there is the potential for a
marked difference in time to event in the exposed versus the
unexposed group. In addition, since the precise time to event (AF)
may not be known in some people with asymptomatic AF (e.g. in
those with slow AF), we undertook logistic regression analysis.
Nevertheless, our results remained essentially unchanged when we
used either Cox regression analysis or robust Poisson regression
analysis. Compared with logistic regression analysis, both of these
time-dependent regression analyses yielded similar estimates of
regression coefficients for the association between NAFLD and risk
of AF (data not shown). For prediction of incident AF, men and
women were combined and first-order interaction terms for sex￾by-NAFLD interactions on risk for AF were examined. Because
the interactions were not statistically significant (p= 0.38), a sex￾pooled multivariable logistic regression analysis was used. Four
forced-entry regression models were performed: an unadjusted
model; a model adjusted for age and sex (model 1); a model further
adjusted for hypertension (blood pressure $140/90 mmHg or
treatment), and electrocardiographic LVH and PR interval (model
2); and, finally, a regression model (model 3) adjusted for variables
included in the 10-year Framingham Heart Study-derived AF risk
score (i.e. age, sex, BMI, systolic BP, hypertension treatment,
electrocardiographic PR interval and history of heart failure) [20].
As sensitivity analyses, we restricted our association analysis
between NAFLD and incident AF to patients at the baseline
examination who did not have a documented history of ischemic
heart disease and heart failure (n= 353). A Kaplan-Meier analysis
of incidence curves for AF during 10 years of follow-up was
undertaken; in patients with, and without NAFLD at baseline.
Differences between groups was tested by the log-rank test.

All analyses were performed using statistical package SPSS 19.0
and statistical significance was assessed at the two-tailed 0.05
threshold.
Results
Overall, the 400 randomly selected participants did not
significantly differ from the initially eligible sample of 1,718 type
2 diabetic patients in terms of baseline demographics (age: 64610
vs. 6664 years; male sex: 58.7 vs. 60.5%; duration of diabetes:
667 vs. 864 years), HbA1c (7.661.6 vs. 7.461.0%), documented
history of CHD (9.3 vs. 10.6%) and heart failure (2 vs. 3.5%),
proportion of obesity (43.9 vs. 46.7%), hypertension (70 vs. 73.6%)
and NAFLD on ultrasound (70.2 vs. 72.4%).
Of the 400 participants included in the study, 281 (70.2%)
patients met the clinical criteria for diagnosis of NAFLD (i.e.,
hepatic steatosis on ultrasound among persons who drank less than
20 g/day of alcohol, and who did not have viral hepatitis, drug￾induced liver disease, iron overload or other secondary causes of
liver disease) and 119 (29.8%) patients did not.
During the 10 years of follow-up, 42 patients developed incident
AF (i.e., cumulative incidence of 10.5%). The baseline character￾istics of participants stratified by AF status at follow-up are
displayed in Table 1. At baseline, patients who developed AF at
follow-up were older, had longer duration of diabetes, longer
electrocardiographic PR interval, and greater frequencies of
hypertension, electrocardiographic LVH and carotid artery
stenoses $30% than those who did not. Patients who developed

AF at follow-up were also more likely to have a documented
history of heart failure and had higher values of systolic BP and
pulse pressure. Notably, 90% of patients who developed AF at
follow-up had NAFLD on ultrasound at baseline. Patients who
developed AF also had higher serum GGT levels, although the
vast majority of patients (,90%) had baseline serum ALT and
GGT levels within the laboratory reference ranges. Sex, BMI,
smoking, serum lipids, HbA1c, CKD, history of previous CHD
and mild valvular heart disease, and use of ACE-inhibitors,
angiotensin receptor antagonists, beta blockers, lipid-lowering,
anti-platelet and hypoglycemic drugs did not significantly differ
between the groups.
As expected, when the study participants were grouped
according to their NAFLD status at baseline (Table 2), patients
with NAFLD were more likely to be obese, to be hypertensive, and
had higher systolic BP, higher pulse pressure, higher plasma
triglycerides and lower HDL-cholesterol than those without
NAFLD. They also were more frequently treated with oral
hypoglycemic drugs and ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin receptor
antagonists and had higher serum liver enzyme levels, although
the vast majority of patients with NAFLD had normal serum ALT
and GGT levels.
Notably, as shown in Figure 2, there was also a marked
difference in the overall cumulative incidence of AF in patients
with NAFLD compared with those without NAFLD (p,0.001).
Figure 3 shows a Kaplan-Meier analysis of incidence curves for
AF during 10 years of follow-up in patients with and without
NAFLD at baseline. The difference between the two groups was
statistically significant and the incidence of AF increased markedly
after 6 years of follow-up (p,0.005 by the log-rank test).
Table 3 shows the effect of the adjustment for known risk factors
on the relationship between NAFLD and risk of incident AF. In
univariate analysis (unadjusted model), NAFLD was significantly
associated with an increased risk of incident AF. After adjustment
for age and sex (model 1), NAFLD maintained a significant
association with risk of incident AF. Importantly, the strength of
the association between NAFLD and incident AF was not
attenuated after additional adjustment for hypertension and
electrocardiographic features, i.e. LVH and PR interval (model
2). Notably, in this regression model, other independent predictors
of incident AF were older age, LVH and longer PR interval
(Table 3). As also shown in Table 3, in a less parsimonious
regression model (model 3), the adjustment for variables that were
included in the 10-year Framingham Heart Study-derived AF risk
score did not appreciably weaken the association between NAFLD
and incident AF. However, given the relatively small number of
events, the results of this latter regression model should be
interpreted with some caution.
Notably, the significant association between NAFLD and
increased risk of incident AF remained essentially unchanged
even after excluding those (n = 47) with documented history of
CHD and heart failure: unadjusted model (OR 4.03, 95% CI 1.4–
11.6, p,0.01), adjusted model 1 (adjusted-OR 4.83, 95% CI 1.6–
14.5, p,0.01), model 2 (adjusted-OR 4.05, 95% CI 1.1–15.3,
p,0.05) and model 3 (adjusted-OR 3.78, 95% CI 1.1–13.2,
p,0.05), respectively.
We also conducted other sensitivity analyses to evaluate the
robustness of our findings (p values for interaction .0.15 in all
subgroups analyses). Almost identical results were found when the
results were stratified by sex (OR 2.98, 95% CI 1.1–12.2, for
women, and OR 10.4, 95% CI 1.4–80 for men, respectively); by
age (OR 8.62, 95% CI 1.1–65 for those aged #70 years, and OR
3.94, 95% CI 1.1–14.5 for those older than 70 years of age); by
status of electrocardiographic PR interval (OR 3.43, 95% CI 1.1–
14.6 for those with PR interval ,200 msec, and OR 6.01, 95% CI
1.2–29.7 for those with PR interval $200 msec); and by
electrocardiographic LVH status (OR 5.31, 95% CI 1.2–25.0
for those without LVH, and OR 4.23, 95% CI 1.02–18.2 for those
with LVH, respectively).
Discussion
NAFLD and AF are two pathologic conditions that are highly
prevalent in Western countries and that share multiple cardiome￾tabolic risk factors. Presently, the published research on the

sparse. In a large retrospective cohort study, it has been reported
that the prevalence of ALT elevations (i.e. defined as serum ALT
.40 U/L), as surrogate markers of NAFLD, among a routine
clinical care population with AF was high (i.e. 27.6%), although
the incidence of new persistent and significant ALT elevations was
uncommon [21]. More interestingly, the Framingham Heart
Study investigators have recently shown that moderately elevated
serum ALT or AST levels (.40 U/L for either marker) were
independently associated with an increased incidence of AF over a
8-year follow-up period in a community-based cohort of 3,744
adults, who were free of clinical heart failure at baseline [16].
To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study to examine
the role of NAFLD as detected by ultrasonography (which is a
more accurate measure of liver fat than serum transaminase levels)
in predicting development of incident AF in patients with type 2
diabetes, who were clinically free from AF at baseline. The major
finding of our study was that NAFLD was significantly associated
with an increased risk of incident AF during a follow-up period of
10 years. Notably, and more importantly, this association was
independent of numerous clinical risk factors for AF.
In accordance with previously published reports, we found that
older age, LVH and longer PR interval on ECG (i.e. a measure of
left atrial size) were strong predictors of incident AF [12–
14,22,23]. It is well known that LVH causes LV dysfunction
and left atrial enlargement, which may lead to fibrosis and
electrical remodelling of the atrium, providing a pathophysiolog￾ical substrate for subsequent development of AF [10,24]. Recently,
the Framingham Heart Study investigators published a clinical risk
score for development of AF in 10 years that incorporated the
presence of age, sex, BMI, systolic BP, hypertension treatment,
longer PR interval and history of heart failure [20]. Similarly, the
Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study showed that a 10-year
clinical risk score incorporating age, race, smoking, systolic BP,
hypertension treatment, electrocardiographic LVH, electrocardio￾graphic left atrial enlargement, diabetes, CHD and heart failure
was predictive for development of AF in a multi-ethnic,
community-based cohort of individuals [25].
Although there are few data on cardiac function among patients
with NAFLD, preliminary evidence indicates that there is a strong
relationship between NAFLD and early LV diastolic dysfunction
in both non-diabetic and type 2 diabetic individuals [5–7]. It is
likely that LV diastolic dysfunction plays a role in AF pathogenesis
either by increasing pressure that can affect stretch receptors in
pulmonary veins triggers and other areas of the atria or by
inducing direct structural changes in atrial myocardium [10,24].
Interestingly, two large population-based studies have also shown
that moderately elevated serum GGT levels, as surrogate markers
of NAFLD, are independently associated with an increased risk of
incident heart failure [8,9]. Collectively, as reported above, our
findings confirm and extend to patients with type 2 diabetes, using
Table 3. Logistic regression models for NAFLD as a predictor for development of AF in patients with type 2 diabetes.

liver ultrasound for diagnosing NAFLD, the recent results reported
by Sinner et al. [16] demonstrating that NAFLD (as detected by
serum transaminase levels) is an independent predictor of new￾onset AF in the adult general population.
The underlying mechanisms responsible for the association
between NAFLD and increased risk of incident AF require further
study. Speculatively, they could include some of the following.
Firstly, the association between NAFLD and incident AF is simply
a consequence of the shared risk factors and comorbid conditions.
However, it is important to underline that in our study NAFLD
was associated with an increased risk of incident AF, indepen￾dently of age, sex, hypertension, electrocardiographic LVH and
other clinical risk factors included in the 10-year Framingham
Heart Study-derived AF risk score. The odds ratio was not
attenuated after adjustment for these potential confounders, thus
suggesting that the increased risk of incident AF associated with
NAFLD, cannot be fully explained by these shared AF risk factors.
Again, the increased risk of AF associated with NAFLD also
remained, even after excluding participants with a documented
history of previous CHD and heart failure. Secondly, it could be
postulated that NAFLD is a marker of ectopic fat accumulation in
other tissues, including both the myocardium and pericardium.
Rijzewijk et al. [26] and Ng et al. [27] showed that the intra￾myocardial fat content, as detected by proton magnetic resonance
spectroscopy, was greater in patients with type 2 diabetes than in
nondiabetic controls, and was associated with LV diastolic
dysfunction. Interestingly, in the study by Rijzewijk et al. [26]
there was also a significant, positive association between intra￾myocardial and intra-hepatic fat content. Recently, it has been
also reported that increased pericardial fat volume was associated
with both increased left atrial dimensions [28] and increased
prevalence of AF [29], independently of multiple established risk
factors. Moreover, Shin et al. reported that total and inter-atrial
epicardial adipose tissues were larger in AF patients than in
matched controls and were independently associated with left
atrial remodeling among patients with AF [30]. Preliminary
experimental evidence suggests that adipocytes from epicardial or
retro-sternal adipose tissues could directly modulate the electro￾physiological properties and ion currents, causing higher arrhyth￾mogenesis, in isolated rabbit left atrial myocytes [31]. Thirdly,
because in our study NAFLD was associated with increased AF
incidence, independently of multiple potential confounders, it is
also possible to speculate that NAFLD is not only associated with
the risk of AF as the consequence of the shared risk factors but that
NAFLD per se might partly contribute to the development and
persistence of AF. This process might occur through the systemic
release of pathogenic mediators from the steatotic and inflamed
liver, including C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis
factor-alpha, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and other inflam￾matory cytokines. Importantly, several studies have shown that
these pathogenic mediators are remarkably higher in patients with
NAFLD than in those without [6,7,32], and may play a role in the
development and persistence of AF, possibly by inducing structural
and/or electrical remodeling of the atria [33–36]. These pathways
may represent a novel pathogenic mechanism by which structural
changes resulting from chronic inflammation can perpetuate AF.
These findings require further testing and confirmation in larger
clinical trials. Nevertheless, these pathways might provide a
potential target for pharmacological interruption or reversal of
atrial structural remodeling [33–36].
Our study has some important limitations. First, our cohort
comprised of type 2 diabetic patients of European extraction, so
that the results cannot be generalized directly to other ethnic
groups. Second, there were a relatively small number of clinical
events during the follow-up and, therefore, the results should be
interpreted with some caution. Third, the diagnosis of NAFLD
was based on ultrasonography that is relatively insensitive to the
presence of smaller amounts of hepatic steatosis (,33% liver fat

infiltration) and that cannot distinguish NASH from other forms of
NAFLD (although, that said, the overall sensitivity and specificity
of ultrasonography for detecting moderate and severe hepatic
steatosis are ,85% and ,95% respectively, when compared to
liver biopsy as a gold-standard) [19]. Although some non￾differential misclassification of NAFLD on the basis of ultraso￾nography is likely (i.e., some of the control patients with diabetes
could have mild hepatic steatosis and undetected NAFLD, despite
normal serum liver enzymes and a negative ultrasonography
examination); this limitation would serve to attenuate the
magnitude of our effect measures towards the null. Thus, we
reason that our results can probably be considered a conservative
estimate of the relationship between NAFLD and increased AF
incidence. Since hepatic ultrasonography was assessed at baseline
only, we could not investigate the relationship of changes
(development or resolution) in hepatic steatosis over time to
incident AF risk. Fourth, the diagnosis of LVH was based on
widely accepted ECG criteria (that have a very high specificity but
a relatively low sensitivity when compared with echocardiographic
findings) [17]. Unfortunately, no echocardiographic measure￾ments were available in this study. However, our data have been
also adjusted for systolic BP and hypertension treatment, which
are likely to capture almost all patients with LVH not detected by
classical ECG voltage criteria. In addition, it is important to
recognise that the additional incorporation of echocardiographic
measurements only slightly improved the predictive ability of the
10-year Framingham Heart Study-derived risk score for the
development of AF [20]. Finally, we cannot exclude residual
confounding.
Notwithstanding these limitations, our study has important
strengths, including its prospective design, the long duration of
follow-up (10 years), the relatively large number of participants of
both sexes, the diagnosis of hepatic steatosis by ultrasonography
(which was performed in all patients by a single experienced
radiologist), the complete nature of the dataset, and the ability to
adjust for baseline AF risk factors included in the 10-year
Framingham risk prediction model [20].
In conclusion, our study is the first to demonstrate that
ultrasound-diagnosed NAFLD is closely associated with an
increased incidence of AF in patients with type 2 diabetes,
independently of important clinical risk factors for AF. Further
studies are needed to confirm this finding in other populations, to
elucidate the responsible mechanisms for this association, and to
explore whether pharmacological interventions aimed at improv￾ing NAFLD effectively reduce the incidence of AF in patients with
type 2 diabetes. In the interim, from the perspective of clinical
practice, it is important that specialists and practicing clinicians be
aware of the link between NAFLD and AF, especially because of
the high and growing prevalence of these two pathologies.
