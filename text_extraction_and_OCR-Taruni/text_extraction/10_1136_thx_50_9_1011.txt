Abstract


A 44 year old patient with end stage idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
underwent single left lung transplantation. A perfusion lung scan
performed 13 days after transplantation revealed deficient perfusion
in the transplanted lung. Pulmonary angiography showed severe
pulmonary artery anastomotic stenosis. Percutaneous insertion of a
balloon expandable stent improved both pulmonary perfusion and
respiratory function.
