herapeutic angiogenesis has been the recent focus of
attention as a new treatment for severe ischemic
heart disease unable to be treated by medication,
catheter intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting
(CABG).1,2 We considered the possibility of achieving
angiogenesis with bone marrow cells (BMC) because they
contain various kinds of primitive cells that can differenti￾ate into endothelial cells and secrete several growth factors.
We recently achieved angiogenesis by the local implanta￾tion of autologous BMC in vivo,3 and subsequently reported
angiogenesis in the ischemic rat heart and hindlimb induced
by this method.4,5 Other groups have obtained similar
results,6,7 and the angiogenesis induced by local implanta￾tion of autologous BMC in rats has been shown to improve
the loss of physical function related to ischemia.8 We inves￾tigated the safety of this treatment in a canine heart model.
Echocardiographic evaluation of cardiac function, Holter
electrocardiogram, blood tests and local histological find￾ings of heart muscle did not demonstrate any evidence of
systemic or local toxicity induced by this treatment in the
acute or chronic phases. Therefore, we began a clinical trial
in 5 patients in October 1999, referring to the new treat￾ment as local BMC implantation (BMCI). All 5 have been
followed up for 1 year and we present here the evidence for
the efficacy and safety of this new treatment.

The clinical trial was approved by the Medical Ethics
Committee of Yamaguchi University School of Medicine,
and informed consent was obtained from all the patients
enrolled. The Medical Ethics Committee stipulated that this
therapy must only be performed concomitantly with CABG,
and that the only approved candidates were those patients
scheduled to undergo CABG who had at least one ischemic
area unsuitable for the traditional treatments of percuta￾neous transluminal coronary angioplasty or bypass grafting
to the stenotic coronary artery. Although an old myocardial
infarction could be an indication, an infarcted area that
involved wall thinning with little remaining myocardium
was a contraindication.
The procedure was performed under general anesthesia
as follows. Bone marrow cells were collected from the iliac
bone, around the anterior superior spine, in a standard
fashion, and the CABG procedure was begun simultane￾ously. The harvested BMC were diluted with RPMI 1640
(Nikken Bio Medical Laboratory, Kyoto, Japan) containing
heparin and then 200–400 ml were saved in a sterile pack
from the Bone Marrow Collection Kit (Baxter, IL, USA).
During CABG, the mononuclear cell fraction was prepared
with a COBE Spectra Apheresis System (Gambro, Stock￾holm, Sweden) and the cell count was adjusted from 5×108
to 1×109 cells/ml. When CABG was completed and the
heart was still arrested under cardiopulmonary bypass, the
autologous mononuclear cell-rich fraction of BMC was
injected into the area of ischemic myocardium where was
no graft. The injection volume was 0.1ml (5×107 to 1×108
cells/point) and injections were spaced 1cm apart, using a 1
ml syringe and a 26-gauge needle. After the final injection,
the aortic clamp was released, the patient was weaned from
cardiopulmonary bypass, and the chest wall was closed.

A new therapy for severe ischemic heart disease has been developed; therapeutic angiogenesis induced by the
local implantation of autologous bone marrow cells (BMC). After confirming that no detrimental changes were
induced by this treatment in a canine heart model, a clinical trial was commenced in 1999. Thus far, 5 patients
have been given this new treatment concomitant with coronary artery bypass grafting and all have been followed
up for at least 1 year. Autologous BMC were implanted into the ungraftable area and postoperative cardiac
scintigraphy showed specific improvement in coronary perfusion in 3 of the 5 patients. Postoperative chest radi￾ography, electrocardiography, echocardiography and blood tests did not reveal any detrimental changes. In
conclusion, this new therapy appears to be safe and could provide a treatment option for patients with otherwise
untreatable ischemic heart disease. (Jpn Circ J 2001; 65: 845–847)

were carried out according to our standard clinical proto￾col. Echocardiography and scintigraphy were performed 1
month and 1 year after surgery. Cardiac catheterization was
performed 1 month after surgery.
Table1 shows the clinical and surgical details of the 5
patients in this series. The ischemic myocardium could not
be grafted in any of these patients because no graftable
coronary arteries existed, although the target myocardium
remained viable. Postoperative coronary angiography was
performed in all 5 patients and all the grafts were confirmed
to be patent. However, it was difficult to clearly identify all
vessels newly formed by BMCI on angiography. Three
patients showed significant improvement on myocardial
radionuclide images. The remaining 2 patients did not show
specific ischemic changes on preoperative scintigrams,
although there was significant stenosis in the coronary
artery, and so the efficacy of BMCI could not be judged in
those 2 patients. Brief reports of the 3 patients in whom
improved blood flow was demonstrated are summarized.
Case 1
A 67-year-old man underwent a preoperative coronary
angiogram, which showed significant stenosis in the left
anterior descending artery (LAD), diagonal branch, and the
circumflex artery (Cx) (nos. 11 and 15). CABG to the LAD,
diagonal branch, and posterolateral (no.14PL) branch was
carried out. The no. 15PL branch could not be grafted
because the coronary artery was too small and so we
performed BMCI. Postoperative exercise thallium (201Tl)
scintigraphy showed no ischemic changes in the area 1
month after the treatment.
Case 3
A 59-year-old man underwent a preoperative coronary
angiogram, which showed significant stenosis in the left
main trunk, Cx (no. 11), posterolateral branch (no. 15PL),
and right coronary artery (RCA). CABG to the LAD, RCA,
and no. 14PL branch was performed, but the no.15PL
branch could not be grafted so we performed BMCI.
Postoperative technetium (99mTc) scintigraphy showed an
improved perfusion image in the posterolateral region 1
month after the treatment.
Case 5
A 73-year-old woman underwent a preoperative coro￾nary angiogram, which showed significant stenosis in the
LAD, Cx, and RCA. There was no graftable coronary
artery in the Cx area (Fig 1A), so we performed BMCI to
the entire Cx. Postoperative 201Tl scintigraphy showed
improved perfusion image in the Cx area 1 month after the
treatment (Fig 1B).
The scintigraphic improvements of blood flow in the
BMCI-treated areas were confirmed 1 year after surgery in
all 3 patients.
The mechanism of BMCI in combination with CABG 
is extremely complex. Based on our studies of animal
ischemic models, the improvement of blood flow in the
BMCI-treated area can be attributed partly to the endothe￾lial differentiation and the production of angiogenic factors
in the local implanted BMC.
All the patients given this treatment had an uneventful
postoperative course without any complications. The white
blood cell counts, and serum C-reactive protein, aspartate
aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehy￾drogenase, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, creatine kinase
(CK), and CK-MB levels in the 5 BMCI patients did not
significantly differ from those in 30 control patients who
underwent standard CABG alone during the same period.
There was no new-onset arrhythmia or any significant
bleeding in the BMCI patients. Moreover, no significant
changes were observed in the postoperative ECG recorded
during the acute phase, and the Holter electrocardiogram
showed a normal pattern in these patients 1 year after treat￾ment. Echocardiography did not reveal any evidence of

calcification or teratogenic tumours in the BMCI area 1
month or 1 year after treatment. Computed tomography
examination was also performed in 4 of the 5 patients 1
year after treatment, and no local calcification was found in
the treated myocardium.
Based on these clinical outcomes and our safety analysis
in dog hearts, we believe that BMCI is a safe and effective
new treatment for ischemic heart disease. Although BMCI
induces angiogenesis and increases collateral blood flow,
the amount of blood flow to the tissue would be less than
that achieved by bypass grafting; however, until now there
have not been any treatment options for ungraftable areas
and BMCI provides a viable treatment option for such
patients. We will continue our clinical trial, which will
include 5–10 more patients, and will re-evaluate our data.
