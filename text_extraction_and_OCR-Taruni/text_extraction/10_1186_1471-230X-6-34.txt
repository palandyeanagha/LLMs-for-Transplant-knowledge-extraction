Abstract
Background: Liver biopsy is considered the gold standard for assessing histologic lesions of non-alcoholic fatty
liver disease (NAFLD). The aim was to develop and validate a new biomarker of non alcoholic steato hepatitis
(NASH) the NashTest (NT) in patients with NAFLD.
Methods: 160 patients with NAFLD were prospectively included in a training group, 97 were included in a
multicenter validation group and 383 controls. Histological diagnoses used Kleiner et al's scoring system, with 3
classes for NASH: "Not NASH", "Borderline", "NASH"). The area under the ROC curves (AUROC), sensitivity
(Se), specificity (Sp), and positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) were assessed.
Results: NT was developed using patented algorithms combining 13 parameters: age, sex, height, weight, and
serum levels of triglycerides, cholesterol, alpha2macroglobulin, apolipoprotein A1, haptoglobin, gamma-glutamyl￾transpeptidase, transaminases ALT, AST, and total bilirubin. AUROCs of NT for the diagnosis of NASH in the
training and validation groups were, respectively, 0.79 (95%CI 0.69–0.86) and 0.79 (95%CI 0.67–0.87; P = 0.94);
for the diagnosis of borderline NASH they were: 0.69 (95%CI 0.60–0.77) and 0.69 (95%CI 0.57–0.78; P = 0.98)
and for the diagnosis of no NASH, 0.77 (95%CI 0.68–0.84) and 0.83 (95%CI 0.67–0.90; P = 0.34). When the two
groups were pooled together the NashTest Sp for NASH = 94% (PPV = 66%), and Se = 33% (NPV = 81%); for
borderline NASH or NASH Sp = 50% (PPV = 74%) and Se = 88% (NPV = 72%).

Background
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents a
spectrum of conditions characterized histologically by an
excessive accumulation of hepatic fat in the absence of
alcohol consumption. Two main histological patterns of
NAFLD have been described: bland steatosis and steato￾hepatitis (NASH). NAFLD is an increasingly recognized
cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality [1-3].
Although the majority of patients do not develop compli￾cations, 28% may develop serious liver sequelae, includ￾ing end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma.
Those at highest risk include patients with significant
hepatic necro-inflammation and fibrosis [1-6]. Liver
biopsy, therefore, has been recommended for confirming
its diagnosis and for providing prognostic information
[7].
There are several drawbacks in using liver biopsy for this
purpose [8]. It is an invasive and costly procedure, and is
prone to complications, some minor, such as pain, others
more severe with a recorded risk of death of 0.01% [9-11].
Notably, as in other chronic liver diseases, there is high
sampling variability; and high intra- and inter-pathologist
variability [12-14]. Most importantly, the number of
patients at risk for NAFLD is high enough that liver biopsy
is not a practical and efficient tool for identifying those at
risk of NASH and advanced fibrosis. Indeed an estimated
15 to 20% of the Western European population has stea￾tosis [15], while more than half of Americans are over￾weight or obese.
Because liver biopsy is impossible to perform in such large
cohorts of individuals, some investigators have tried to
identify simple non-invasive markers of liver injury in
patients with NAFLD.
Different studies have shown that factors which are asso￾ciated with NASH in patients with NAFLD are male gen￾der, age, the extent of obesity, type 2 diabetes, high levels
of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase
and triglycerides, high HOMA indices of insulin resist￾ance, systemic hypertension, high levels of C-peptide
[6,16-21], hyaluronic acid and type VI collagen [22], TNF￾alpha and IL-8 [23], and serum acute phase proteins [24].
However, these findings are not consistent between stud￾ies and have been generated through retrospective studies,
all amenable to known and unknown biases.
In the last five years, we have developed several panels of
simple biochemical markers known as FibroTest (FT),
ActiTest, (Biopredictive Paris, France,) SteatoTest (ST)
(Biopredictive Paris, France) and AshTest (Biopredictive
Paris, France) (HCV/HBV FibroSURE, Steato-FibroSURE,
Ash-FibroSURE in the US). ActiTest was developed for the
grading of necroinflammation in viral hepatitis C and B.
AshTest was developed for the diagnosis of alcoholic￾steato-hepatitis in heavy drinkers
FT has demonstrated high predictive values for advanced
fibrosis in patients with NAFLD [25] similar to those pre￾viously observed for chronic hepatitis C [26-28], chronic
hepatitis B [29,30], and alcoholic liver disease (ALD)
[31,32]. The diagnostic value of FT was also confirmed in
these different chronic liver diseases by independent
groups and comparison with the other panels, glycomics
and elastometry [32-34].
ST has demonstrated high predictive values for the diag￾nosis of steatosis in patients with NAFLD, chronic hepati￾tis C, chronic hepatitis B, and ALD [35].
AshTest has demonstrated high predictive values for the
diagnosis of alcoholic steato-hepatitis in heavy drinkers
[36].
Therefore NASH was the only important histological fea￾ture for which no biomarkers were available. The objec￾tive of the current study was to validate the diagnostic
utility of a new panel of biomarkers, NashTest (NT), for
the detection of NASH in patients with NAFLD in order to
reduce the need for liver biopsy.
Methods
Study population
The populations screened for inclusion in the present
study were the same as those used in previously published
validation studies for FT in NAFLD. The inclusion criteria
were the same for the validation groups. For the training
groups, the only difference in the present study was the
exclusion of patients without histological steatosis,
though these have been included in FT training and vali￾dation studies [25]. The rational of excluding patients
without steatosis was to focus on the diagnosis of NASH
versus no NASH among patients with non alcoholic stea￾tosis. This has been possible since the validation of a non￾invasive test for the diagnosis of steatosis recently pub￾lished [35].
Training group
The inclusion criteria were patients with suspected NAFLD
hospitalized in our department having steatosis at liver
biopsy. Exclusion criteria included a daily alcohol con￾sumption of at least 50 gm of pure ethanol equivalent for
males and 30 gm for females during the preceding year,
concomitant liver diseases (the presence of HCV antibody
or HBs antigen, auto-immune hepatitis, hemochromato￾sis diagnosed by genetic markers, Wilson's disease, alpha
anti-trypsine deficiency), HIV antibodies and immuno￾suppression, and an interval greater than 3 months
between serum sampling and liver biopsy. Between Janu-

ary 2001 and December 2004, 238 patients were hospital￾ized for suspected NAFLD; 160 patients were included
and 78 patients were excluded for the following reasons
(several causes were present in four patients): no steatosis
in 20, associated liver disease in two, missing data in 39
(biomarkers not performed in 37 patients, biopsy not per￾formed in two patients), and an interval between biopsy
and markers greater than 3 months in 21 patients. Char￾acteristics are given in Table 1.
Validation group
These were patients from a prospective multicentric study
(CYTOL study). The aim of the CYTOL study was to assess
the cause of chronic abnormal ALT or GGT values in
patients without heavy alcohol consumption, who had no
markers of HCV (HCV antibody), HBV (HBs antigen),
autoimmune hepatitis (negative for anti-actin, anti￾nuclear, anti-LKM1 antibodies), hemochromatosis
(genetic markers), Wilson's disease, or alpha anti-trypsine
deficiency. For the present study only the CYTOL patients
with hepatic steatosis at biopsy with suspicion of NAFLD
were considered for inclusion. Between February 2002
and August 2004, among the 274 patients of the CYTOL
study, 166 patients with steatosis at biopsy were consid￾ered for inclusion, 97 patients were included and 69
patients were excluded for the following reasons: 31
because they were being followed in the training center
(but not included in the training set), and 38 due to the
presence of miscellaneous associated liver diseases. Char￾acteristics are given in Table 1.
Control group
A total of 383 prospectively included blood donors or
healthy volunteers from the training enter were used as
controls.
This protocol was carried out in compliance with the Hel￾sinki Declaration. Serum sampling and liver biopsy were
part of the routine in the different institutions.All patients
and controls gave verbal informed consent for the use of
data and serum for research purposes and this was
approved by the ethical committee of Paris Pitié
Salpêtrière Hospital.
Histological analysis
Liver biopsies were fixed, paraffin-embedded, and stained
with at least hematoxylin-eosin-safran, iron staining, and
Masson's trichrome or picrosirius red for collagen. A sin￾gle pathologist, unaware of patient characteristics, ana￾lyzed the histological features in each group, FC in the
training group and BLB in the validation group.
A scoring system recently published by Kleiner et al [14]
was used. Fibrosis was staged as follows: stage 0 = no
fibrosis; stage 1 = perisinusoidal or periportal fibrosis with
3 different patterns: 1A = mild, zone 3, perisinusoidal; 1B
= moderate, zone 3, perisinusoidal fibrosis, and 1C = por￾tal/periportal fibrosis; stage 2 = perisinusoidal and portal/
periportal fibrosis; stage 3 = bridging fibrosis; stage 4 = cir￾rhosis. Steatosis was scored from 0 to 3 with a four grades
scoring system from S0 to S3: S0_no steatosis or less than
5% (low to medium -power evaluation of parenchymal
involvement by steatosis), S1_5%–33%, S2_ > 33%–66%,
S3_ > 66%.
We used two definitions of NASH. The main endpoint
was steatohepatitis defined as a NAS score of 5 or greater.
The histological NASH score (NAS) is defined as the
unweighted sum of the scores for steatosis (0–3), lobular
inflammation (0–3), and ballooning (0–2); scores there￾fore ranged from 0 to 8. Cases with NAS of 0 to 2 were
considered not diagnostic of NASH; on the other hand,
cases with scores of 5 or greater were diagnosed as NASH.
Cases with activity scores of 3 and 4 were considered as
borderline (probable) NASH [14]. The second endpoint
was the determination of the pathologist of whether the
NASH is present or not.
Serum biochemical markers
FibroTest (FT) (Biopredictive, Paris, France, patented arti￾ficial intelligence algorithm USPTO 6,631,330) includes
total bilirubin, GGT, α2-macroglobulin, apolipoprotein
A1, and haptoglobin, corrected for age and gender, and is
designed for a quantitative assessment of fibrosis.
SteatoTest (ST) is a new panel (SteatoTest, Biopredictive,
Paris, France, patent pending), recently published, com￾bining the 6 components of the FibroTest-ActiTest
adjusted for age, gender and BMI, plus AST, serum glu￾cose, triglycerides and cholesterol. ST scores range from
zero to 1.00, with higher scores indicating a greater prob￾ability of significant steatosis.
The new panel, NT (Biopredictive, Paris, France, patent
pending), was constructed in the training group combin￾ing age, gender, the 6 components of the FibroTest-ActiT￾est (Biopredictive, Paris, France, patented artificial
intelligence algorithm USPTO 6,631,330) plus weight,
height, AST, serum glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and
ST. AST, ALT, GGT, cholesterol, triglycerides, and total
bilirubin were measured by an autoanalyzer Hitachi 917
Automate (Mannheim, Germany) using Roche Diagnos￾tics reagents (Mannheim, Germany). Alpha2-macroglobu￾lin, apolipoprotein A1, and haptoglobin were measured
using an automatic nephelometer (BNII, Dade Behring;
Marburg, Germany). The laboratory followed the recom￾mended and validated procedures to insure reproducibil￾ity between FT components [27,28]. All the biochemical
components had been prospectively assessed and assays
were performed on fresh serum. NT was computed only if

ST demonstrated a steatosis. The first algorithm used the
SteatoTest. If there is no presumed steatosis the result of
NashTest is Non NASH. If there is a steatosis the other
algorithms are computed. The next algorithms included
all the components of the FibroTest and of the SteatoTest,
using specific weights in three logistic regression formula,
one for the diagnosis of no NASH, one for borderline
NASH and one for the diagnostic of NASH. The most dis￾criminant parameters were weight and gender for the clin￾ical parameters, AST, GGT and glucose for biological
parameters. The three regressions permitted to generate
probabilities and to classify the patient in one of the 3 cat￾egories. All the parameters were also used to generate
security algorithms to detect abnormal values as previ￾ously described (27).
Statistical analyses
The primary outcome was the diagnosis of NASH in the
three categories according to Kleiner et al: NASH, Border￾line NASH, No NASH.
Sensitivity analysis compared patients without alcohol
consumption to patients with a small alcohol consump￾tion (less than 20 g a day for females and less than 30 g for
males) and to those with mild consumption (between 20
and 30 g for females, between 30 to 50 g for males),
patients with elevated or normal baseline ALTs; patients
without a high risk of biochemical components failure,
patients with a baseline biopsy length less or greater than
25 mm, and with or without fragmentation. The diagnos￾tic value of NT was also estimated using the pathologist
determination of Nash or no Nash.
Clinically significant discordance between NT and biopsy
was defined as a two classification discordance: NASH as
predicted by NT and no Nash as observed at biopsy; or the
inverse, no Nash as predicted by NT and Nash as observed
at biopsy. The cause of high discordance between NT and
biopsy was attributed according to the respective risk fac￾tors of failure. Risk factors of NT failure were hemolysis,
Gilbert's syndrome, acute inflammation, extrahepatic
cholestasis and extreme values outside the 98% percen￾tiles for one component of NT. Risk factors of biopsy fail￾ure were biopsy size (less than 25 mm) and fragmentation
(more than one fragment). Failure attributable to biopsy
(false negative) was suspected when the biopsy was
smaller than 15 mm and fragmented, in the absence of
risk factors of NT failure and with at least another sign of
steato-hepatitis not belonging to Kleiner scoring system,
such as piece meal necrosis.
Statistical analysis used Fisher's exact test, the chi-square
test, Student's t test, the Mann-Whitney test, and variance
analysis used the Bonferroni all-pair wise and Tukey￾Kramer multiple-comparison tests to take into account
the multiple comparisons and multiple logistic regression
for multivariate analysis. The diagnostic values of the
markers were assessed using sensitivities, specificities,
positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV), and
the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves
(AUROC). AUROC curves were calculated including FT
quantitative values using an empirical non-parametric
method according to Delong et al [37] and compared
using the method of Zhou et al [38]. For all analyses, two￾sided statistical tests were used; a P-value of 0.05 or less
was considered significant. Number Cruncher Statistical
Systems 2003 software (NCSS, Kaysville, Utah, USA) was
used for all analyses.
Results
Patients
A total of 160 patients were included in the training group
and 97 in the validation group. Characteristics of included
patients, as well as those of the non-included groups were
similar (Table 1). The only significant differences
observed were related to the inclusion criteria, with more
metabolic risk factors, more steatosis and more advanced
fibrosis in the included than the non-included patients
(Table 1). When patients included in the training group
were compared to those included in the validation group,
those in the training group were found to be older, and to
have more diabetes and arterial hypertension, more ele￾vated weight and less NASH. The biopsy size in the train￾ing group was longer with more portal tracts than in the
validation group (Table 1).
Diagnosis of NASH
When compared to patients with no NASH, those with
NASH or borderline NASH were older, had a higher
weight, higher alpha2 macroglobulin, higher ALT and
AST, lower GGT, higher glucose higher triglycerides,
higher fibrosis stages as assessed by FibroTest and higher
steatosis grades as assessed by SteatoTest (Table 2 and
Table 3). In multivariate analysis the most discriminant
parameters were weight, AST and GGT (Table 3).
When compared to patients with no or borderline NASH,
those with NASH were older, had higher alpha2 mac￾roglobulin, higher ALT and AST, higher glucose, higher
triglycerides, higher fibrosis stages as assessed by FibroTest
and higher steatosis grades as assessed by SteatoTest
(Table 2 and Table 3). In multivariate analysis the most
discriminant parameters were female gender and glucose
(Table 3).
Diagnostic values of NT for predicting borderline NASH
and NASH in different groups, are given in Table 4 for the
concordance with biopsy results, and in Table 5 for sensi￾tivity, specificity and predictive values. There were similar
discordance rates and predictive values between training

and validation groups. When the two groups were pooled
together, the discordance rates were 4% for two classes
(clinically significant) and 39% for one class, the NashT￾est Sp for Nash = 94% (PPV = 66%) and Se = 33% (NPV =
81%); for borderline Nash or Nash, Sp = 50% (PPV =
74%) and Se = 88% (NPV = 72%) (Table 5).
ROC curves of NT for predicting NASH or borderline
NASH are illustrated in Figures 1 to 3. There was no differ￾ence between the AUROCs in the training and validation
groups, respectively, for No NASH [AUROC = 0.77
(95%CI 0.68–0.84) versus 0.83 (95%CI 0.67–0.90; P =
0.34)] (Figure 1); for Borderline NASH [AUROC = 0.69
(95%CI 0.60–0.77) versus 0.69 (95%CI 0.57–0.78; P =
0.98)] (Figure 2); or for NASH [AUROC = 0.79 (95%CI
0.69–0.86) versus 0.79 (95%CI 0.67–0.78; P = 0.87)]
(Figure 3).
The AUROC of NT for the diagnosis of Nash determined
by the pathologist (171 NASH and 86 Non NASH) inde￾pendent of NAS was 0.78 (95% CI 0.71–0.83) on the
overall population, without difference between the train￾ing and validation groups: 0.69 (95% CI 0.56–0.79) and
0.80 (95% CI 0.69–0.87) respectively (Figure 4).
The values of the different components of NT are detailed
in Figure 5 to 8: Figure 5 for the No-NashTest designed for
the diagnosis of No NASH, Figure 6 for the Borderline￾NashTest designed for the diagnosis of No NASH, Figure
7 for the Nash-NashTest designed for the diagnosis of
NASH and Figure 8 for the Nash-NashTest for the diagno￾sis of NASH as defined by the pathologist.
Analysis of discordance
Among the 11 clinically significant discordances (two
classes difference) observed, nine were attributable to NT
failure (eight false negatives and one false positive) and
two to biopsy (false negatives).
In the training group, there was a clinically significant dis￾cordance in three patients (2%), all with NT predicting
NASH and biopsy showing no NASH. One of these cases
had a good quality biopsy (30 mm non fragmented) but
with piecemeal necrosis and no cause of NT false positive;
two cases had a poor quality biopsy (15 mm and five frag￾ments, 22 mm and two fragments) with piece-meal necro￾sis at biopsy and no cause of NT false positive.
In the validation group there was clinically significant dis￾cordance in eight patients (8%): all were predicted to have
no NASH with NT and NASH at biopsy. None of these
eight patients had a good quality biopsy. There was a very
low triglyceride level (0.1 and 0.3 mmol/L) in two
patients suggesting two instances of NT's false negatives.
Sensitivity analyses
Sensitivity analyses revealed that the NT AUROCs for the
diagnosis of NASH (Table 6) and the diagnosis of border￾line NASH or NASH (Table 7) were not affected by
groups, ALT values, alcohol consumption, Gilbert's syn￾Table 2: Univariate predictors of NASH in training and validation groups

drome, acute inflammation, absence of steatosis, or
biopsy sample length. AUROCs were higher, though not
significantly, in patients with non-fragmented biopsies
than in those with fragmented biopsies. (Tables 4 and 5).
Only nine patients had ALT below the proposed new nor￾mal range for serum ALT and three of those had border￾line NASH.
Controls
Among the 383 controls 26/383 (7%) had steatosis esti￾mated by SteatoTest and none had NASH.
Discussion
Mass screening for significant liver injury in patients with
NAFLD will be an important medical challenge in the
years to come due to the epidemics of obesity and diabe￾tes. The inability of liver biopsy to meet this challenge
makes the development of non-invasive, readily available
and easy to perform serum markers a high priority. In
these patients the priority is to estimate the severity of
fibrosis but also to identify patients with steato-hepatitis
among those with steatosis.
Many studies on non-invasive panels with significant
diagnostic value for fibrosis have been published but so
far the most studied biomarker is the FT [39], having a
specific validation in NAFLD [25]. Many previous studies
have highlighted the potential utility of FT for patients
infected with HCV [26-28,32-34], HBV [29,30] and
patients with ALD [31,32,34].

Few tests have yet been developed for the diagnosis of
steatosis and steato hepatitis [17-21]. We recently high￾lighted the potential utility of ST for the prediction of stea￾tosis in patients with NAFLD, as well as in patients
infected with HCV, HBV and ALD [35]. Since the valida￾tion of ST it is therefore possible to focus on the diagnosis
of NASH in patient with NAFLD after exclusion of patients
without steatosis. The algorithm of NT excluded patients
with steatosis predicted by ST. When screened patients
without histological steatosis were included in a sensitiv￾ity analysis the diagnostic value of NT was not different
than in patients with steatosis only.
We also recently demonstrated the potential utility of
AshTest for the prediction of alcoholic steato-hepatitis in
heavy drinkers [36]. AshTest was designed for the diagno￾sis of patients with severe alcoholic steato hepatitis need￾ing specific treatment [36] and does not have significant
diagnostic value for the diagnosis of NASH (data not
shown). Therefore a specific test for NASH was necessary
to complete the non invasive estimation of frequent his￾tological features in patients with NAFLD.
The most significant components of NT were the meta￾bolic factors (mostly weight, triglycerides and glucose), as
previously observed [17-21], but also A2M and apoA1.
These proteins have been proven to be associated with
fibrosis [26] but also with steatosis [35], steato-hepatitis
[24,25] and insulin resistance pathways [25]. A2M is a
protease inhibitor but also has multiple functions as a
binding, carrier and targeting protein [40]. In patients
with NAFLD we previously demonstrated a very signifi￾cant association between A2M and insulin levels, a hall￾mark of insulin resistance [25]. Other studies have
observed an increase of A2M in diabetic patients [41].
Insulin is covalently bound to A2M [42] in plasma and
A2M is a binding protein of Insulin-like Growth Factor
Binding Protein-1 (IGFBP-1) which modifies the IGFBP￾1/IGF interaction [43]. Therefore A2M can be directly
involved both in the hepatic mechanisms of insulin resist￾ance and fibrogenesis.
Comparisons with biomarkers of alcoholic steato hepati￾tis (ASH) [36] are important as ASH and NASH share
many physio-pathological mechanisms and histological
features. The same associations were observed for proteins
in univariate analysis with a decrease in ApoA1, hap￾toglobin and an increase of A2M in NASH. However the
decrease of apolipoprotein A1 in NASH was much lower
than in patients with ASH. In our NASH population there
was a much lower prevalence of cirrhosis, as well as severe
steato-hepatitis in comparison with the population of

ASH [36]. In the present NAFLD population, only two
patients had a polymorphonuclear infiltrate (1.2%). In
the first case there was a dramatic decrease in ApoA1 (0.05
g/L), as observed in alcoholic steato-hepatitis. In the sec￾ond case the absolute value of ApoA1 was not decreased
(1.72 g/L) but was relatively low in comparison with HDL
cholesterol (1.64 mmol/L).
The present study has several limitations. First, the varia￾bility of the end point, histological steato-hepatitis, is
even greater than for the other features of chronic liver dis￾ease, fibrosis and steatosis. There is both a significant lim￾itation of liver biopsy due to its sampling variability [12],
as observed for HCV hepatitis [44], and a high intra- and
inter- observer variability [13,14]. In the present study

only 25% (63/257) of biopsy samples reached the 25 mm
minimum recommended by Bedossa et al for HCV [44].
When we used sensitivity analyses to compare the
AUROCs of NT according to biopsy quality, there was no
significant difference, although there was a trend in favor
of better AUROCs with non-fragmented biopsies (Table
4). To reduce the observer variability related to the NASH
definition, we used the recent NAS scoring system recom￾mended by Kleiner et al [14]. To the extent that the NAS
represents the severity of current liver injury, the proposed
NT may separate those with more severe injury from those
with little injury. This would be of great value in clinical
trial situations where the investigator might want to enroll
those with severe disease first or perhaps for identifying
patients at greatest risk for progression. However the NAS
was intended for use in monitoring changes in liver dis￾ease and other clinical situations, and was not intended to
replace the pathologist's determination of whether NASH
is present or not. Therefore we checked the utility of the
NT for identifying patients with bona fide NASH using the
pathologist determination. Indeed the value of NT for this
diagnostic of NASH was fair (AUROC = 0.80 in the valida￾tion group).
Because of the biopsy variability, discordances between
biomarker and biopsy results must be discussed case by
case before attributing the cause of error to biomarkers or
to biopsy. In the present study, 3.5 % of patients with dis￾cordance results were attributable to NT failure versus
0.5% to biopsy failure. Being a serum marker, NT has the
advantage of giving a more global estimate of liver steato￾hepatitis throughout the whole liver.
The first validation group included patients from a tertiary
care center, which makes it liable to referral selection bias,
but the second validation group was most representative
of less specialized centers.
We have used less limited inclusion criteria concerning
alcohol consumption with inclusion of patients consum￾ing up to 49 g of alcohol per day, due to our national high
consumption. There was no consensual limit. However
when males consuming 30 g or women 20 g or more per
day were excluded (only a total of 12 patients) according

to recent guidelines for the diagnosis of NAFLD [45], the
diagnostic value of NT was not significantly changed
(Table 6 and Table 7). The prevalence of patients with
metabolic risk factors and moderate alcohol consumption
is important in many countries and should be also ana￾lyzed in diagnostic studies.
Another drawback of liver biopsy is that for most practi￾tioners it seems almost unethical for it to be performed in
patients with normal serum transaminases values. Unfor￾tunately, many patients with NAFLD or NASH have nor￾mal ALT levels and some of them have advanced liver
fibrosis [46-48]. In the present study 50% of patients with
histological borderline NASH or NASH had ALT lower
than 50 IU/L. NT AUROCs for the diagnosis of NASH or
borderline NASH in NAFLD were unchanged in patients
with ALT values lower than 50 IU/L (Table 6 and Table 7);
therefore NT could be used to diagnose NASH even in
patients that are not eligible for liver biopsy.
Although there is no specific treatment currently approved
to treat liver injury in NAFLD, many are being developed.
The diagnosis of advanced fibrosis or NASH could be very
important for motivating patients to make diet or lifestyle
modifications, for the intensive treatment of complica￾tions of the metabolic syndrome or for providing weight
in favor of anti-obesity surgery. The early detection of
advanced fibrosis or NASH is the first step reducing future
cirrhosis-related deaths. Diagnosing silent cirrhosis has
important consequences in terms of screening for portal
hypertension and hepatocellular carcinoma, of prevent￾ing complications and of providing a timely indication for
liver transplantation.
Conclusion
Among patients with suspected NAFLD, the new genera￾tion of biomarkers such as FT, ST and NT will allow better
identification of those at risk and reassurance for patients
without fibrosis or NASH. Biomarkers as a first-line esti￾mate of injury in chronic liver diseases should reduce the
need for liver biopsy [49].

median, and the width of each box the median ± 1.57 inter￾quartile range/√ n (to assess the 95% level of significance 
between group medians). Failure of the shaded boxes to 
overlap signifies statistical significance (P < 0.05). The hori￾zontal lines above and below each box encompass the inter￾quartile range (from 25th to 75th percentile), and the vertical 
lines from the ends of the box encompass the adjacent values 
(upper: 75th percentile plus 1.5 times interquartile range, 
lower 25th percentile minus 1.5 times interquartile range).
