Background: Liver biopsy is an invasive technique with associated major complications. There is no
information on the validity of five non-invasive indexes based on routinely available parameters, estimated
and validated in hepatitis C virus (HCV) monoinfected patients, in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/
HCV coinfected patients.
Aim: To validate these predictive models of liver fibrosis in HIV/HCV coinfected patients.
Patients: A total of 357 (90%) of 398 patients from five hospitals were investigated, who underwent liver
biopsy and who had complete data to validate all of the models considered.
Methods: The predictive accuracy of the indexes was tested by measuring areas under the receiver
operating characteristic curves. Diagnostic accuracy was calculated by estimating sensitivity, specificity,
and positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values.
Results: The models performed better when liver biopsies >15 mm were used as reference. In this setting,
the Forns and Wai indexes, models aimed at discriminating significant fibrosis, showed PPV of 94% and
87%, respectively. Using these models, 27–34% of patients could benefit from exclusion of liver biopsy. If
both models were applied sequentially, 41% of liver biopsies could be spared. The indexes aimed at
predicting cirrhosis achieved NPV of up to 100%. However, they showed very low PPV.
Conclusions: The diagnostic accuracy of these models was lower in HIV/HCV coinfected patients than in
the validation studies performed in HCV monoinfected patients. However, simple fibrosis tests may render
liver biopsy unnecessary in deciding anti-HCV treatment in over one third of patients with HIV infection
and chronic hepatitis C.
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C
virus (HCV) dual infection is highly prevalent among
intravenous drug users as a result of shared transmis￾sion routes.1 In addition, chronic hepatitis C seems to follow
an accelerated course in HIV infection.2 Thus liver failure is
increasingly affecting HIV/HCV coinfected patients, as their
AIDS free survival is being prolonged.3 For these reasons,
HCV infection should be treated in this setting. However, the
available treatment for HCV infection is far from optimal.
Indeed, HIV/HCV coinfected patients show even worse
responses to pegylated interferon plus rivabirin than HCV
monoinfected patients.4 In this regard, different strategies
have been proposed and evaluated to improve the selection of
patients to receive therapy. A rational screening is to perform
a liver biopsy and reserve treatment for those with more
advanced stages of liver fibrosis. We have shown that this
approach would spare up to 40% of coinfected patients from
anti-HCV therapy.5
Liver biopsy is an invasive technique. Although infrequent,
there are major complications associated with liver biopsy.6
Mild adverse events are more frequent, such as pain, that
occurs in more than 30% of biopsied patients.6 Moreover, the
procedure is costly7 and can be limited by sampling error as
only 1/50 000 of the organ is sampled. Hence some authors
have validated models to predict the severity of liver fibrosis
by non-invasive means. Some rely on routine laboratory tests,
easily available in clinical practice.8–14 There are only two
reported models which have focused on non-invasive
diagnosis of liver fibrosis among HIV/HCV coinfected
patients.15 16 However, none of the models has been validated
by independent authors in this population. In addition, the
usefulness of these indexes may be curtailed because some of
the predictive markers, such as a2 macroglobulin, haptoglo￾bin, or apolipoprotein A115 and hyaluronic acid16 are not
routinely used in clinical practice.
Our aim was to validate five predictive models of liver
fibrosis comprising readily available laboratory data, pre￾viously constructed and validated in HCV monoinfected
patients,8–14 in HIV/HCV coinfected patients.
METHODS
Patients
This retrospective cross sectional study included 398 con￾secutive patients with HIV/HCV coinfection who were
admitted to five hospitals in southern Spain for liver biopsy,
from January 1991 to January 2005. Liver biopsies were
taken mainly with the aim of establishing the prognosis and
indicating therapy for chronic hepatitis C. Eligible patients
were those coinfected with HIV and HCV who had undergone
liver biopsy, regardless of levels of transaminases. Exclusion
criteria included positive hepatitis B surface antigen, other
causes of liver disease (autoimmune, tumoral, biliary, or
vascular associated liver disease) and prior anti-HCV therapy.

Clinical, biochemical, and haematological data within one
month of liver biopsy were collected from databases that
abstracted patient records.
For each patient a case report form was completed. It
included the main demographics, and clinical, laboratory,
and virological data at the time of liver biopsy. Recorded
demographics included age, sex, risk category, and history of
alcohol intake. Data regarding both HIV and HCV infections
were recorded, including plasma HIV-RNA, CD4+ T cell
counts at the time of liver biopsy, and antiretroviral therapy.
Regarding HCV infection, data recorded included genotype,
viral load, both at the time of liver biopsy, and date of
infection. The latter was estimated as the first year of needle
exchange in intravenous drug users. The date of HCV
infection was considered as unknown for subjects infected
through sexual contact or an undefined source.
This study was approved by each local ethics committee.
All patients gave written informed consent for liver biopsy.
Predictive indexes of fibrosis
Among the indexes based on routinely available laboratory
tests, we selected those with internal8 9 or external valida￾tion.10–14 These indexes were elaborated with the aim of
discriminating significant fibrosis, F2 to F4 stages, and/or
cirrhosis in HIV seronegative patients:
Indexes aimed at discriminating significant fibrosis
Forns and colleagues8 and Wai and colleagues9 validated their
results in a separate group of patients. The index by Forns
and colleagues8 is calculated by applying the following
regression equation:
7.81123.131 ln (platelet count (109
/l)) + 0.781 ln (c￾glutamyl-transpeptidase (UI/l)) + 3.467 ln (age (y)) 2 0.014
(cholesterol (mg/dl)).
In the estimation of the model by Forns and colleagues,8 the
authors excluded drinkers of more than 30 g/day of alcohol
and the predominant HCV genotype was 1. The high
prevalence of genotype 3 in HIV/HCV coinfected patients3
and its influence on cholesterol levels17 could have affected
the accuracy of the index in our study. Because of this, we also
analysed a subgroup of patients with alcohol intake ,50 g/day
and without genotype 3 to validate this model. The index by
Wai and colleagues,9 known as the AST platelet ratio index
(APRI), is calculated by dividing the aspartate aminotransfer￾ase (AST) level (UI/l), expressed as the number of times above
the upper limit of normal (ULN), by platelet count (109
/l):
AST (/ULN) 6100/platelet count (109
/l)
Alcohol drinkers were not excluded from elaboration of the
index. The cut off points validated by these authors and
positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values of the
indexes are shown in table 1.
Indexes aimed at discriminating cirrhosis
APRI was also aimed at predicting cirrhosis.9 The index by
Bonacini and colleagues10 has been recently validated by
Saadeh and colleagues13 This index was calculated by
assigning arbitrary scores to three laboratory parameters
and summing them with a possible value of 0 to 11. The
laboratory parameters were scored as follows:
(a) platelet count (109
/l): .340 = 0; 280–340 = 1; 220–
270 = 2; 160–219 = 3; 100–159 = 4; 40–99 = 5; ,40 = 6.
(b) ALT/AST ratio: .1.7 = 0; 1.2–1.7 = 1; 0.6–1.19 = 2;
,0.6 = 3.
(c) international normalised ratio: ,1.1 = 0; 1.1–1.4 = 1;
.1.4 = 2.
Alcohol drinkers were not excluded from validation of this
index. AST/ALT ratio and platelet count were assessed as
indexes in numerous previous surveys.11 12 14 Alcohol drinkers
were not excluded in some of the studies that validated AST/ALT
ratio11 or platelet count.12 The cut off points validated by these
authors and PPV and NPV of the indexes are shown in table 1.
Laboratory methods
Blood determinations
HCV infection was diagnosed when serum specific antibodies
were identified by enzyme immunoassay and a recombinant
immunoblot assay before 1996. Since December 1996,
diagnosis of HCV infection was made when a positive

EIA-3 was found and serum viral RNA was detected by either
qualitative or quantitative polymerase chain reaction. HCV
genotype was determined by line probe assay.
Histological evaluation
Specimens were immediately placed in buffered formalin.
After 24 hours of fixation they were embedded in paraffin
using routine methods. Histological evaluation was made on
sections stained with haematoxylin-eosin and Masson’s
trichrome. A single pathologist, who was not aware of the
clinical data of the patients, evaluated all of the stained
sections at each centre. Liver fibrosis was scored following
the Knodell histological activity index modified by Scheuer.18
A minimum liver biopsy length of 10 mm was required.
Reproducibility of liver fibrosis staging was assessed by
blinded re-evaluation by a single pathologist of 50% of the
liver biopsies from each centre randomly selected.
Statistical methods
Continuous variables were expressed as median (Q1–Q3) and
categorical variables as numbers (percentage). Continuous
variables were compared using the Student’s t test or the
Mann-Whitney U test when appropriate. Categorical vari￾ables were compared using the x2 test with Yates’ correction
or Fisher’s test where appropriate.
The predictive accuracy of the indexes was tested by
measuring the areas under the receiver operating character￾istic curves (AUROC). The cut off points evaluated were those
previously validated for each index in HIV uninfected
patients. Diagnostic accuracy was calculated by sensitivity,
specificity, PPV, and NPV. Significant fibrosis (stages 2–4) or
cirrhosis (stage 4) was considered as the disease depending
on the index. Performance of the indexes was also assessed
using ROC curves in different subpopulations of patients,
classified according to the size of their liver biopsies.
Agreement between pathologists from different centres and
the central pathologist was assessed by the kappa test.
Statistical analysis was carried out using the SPSS 11
statistical software package (SPSS, Chicago, Illinois, USA).
RESULTS
Characteristics of the patients
A total of 357 (90%) of 398 patients had complete data for
validation of all of the models. The main characteristics of the
study patients by date of liver biopsy are summarised in
table 2.
Liver biopsy was carried out in 321 (90%) patients after
1997. HCV genotype was 1 in 189 (53%), 3 in 87 (24%), 4 in
46 (13%), and not available in 36 (10%) patients. Median
CD4+ cell counts by the time of liver biopsy were 494 (336–
653) cells/ml. Median nadir CD4+ cell counts were 255 (136–
396) cells/ml. A total of 189 (53%) patients showed unde￾tectable HIV viral load achieved with highly active antire￾troviral therapy (HAART) by the date of liver biopsy: 221
(62%) patients received protease inhibitor based HAART
before liver biopsy, 57 (16%) were treated with nevirapine
based antiretroviral regimens, and 71 (20%) were prescribed
efavirenz based HAART. Good agreement was found between
each centre’s pathologist and the central pathologist in
scoring significant fibrosis (kappa scores 0.76–0.80) and
cirrhosis (kappa scores 0.87–0.93).
Predictive models of fibrosis applied to HIV infected
patients with chronic hepatitis
Models aimed at predicting significant fibrosis
AUROC for the models of Forns and colleagues8 and APRI9 by
biopsy length are shown in table 3. Both models performed
better for biopsy size >15 mm. Further increases in biopsy
length did not improve AUROC. Because of this, 263 (74%) of
357 patients, in which liver biopsy length was at least 15 mm,
were selected to validate these indexes. Characteristics of
these patients are shown in table 2.
For the model of Forns and colleagues,8 applying the lower
cut off level (,4.2), 42 (38%) of 110 patients without
significant fibrosis were correctly identified (table 4).
The presence of significant fibrosis could not be excluded
with certainty, as 33 (44%) of 75 patients with a score ,4.2
had significant fibrosis (NPV 56%). Applying the higher cut
off level (.6.9), 66 (43%) of 153 patients with significant
fibrosis were correctly identified (table 4). Sixty six (94%) of
70 patients with a score .6.9 showed significant fibrosis.
Two of the four falsely classified patients showed F0 and two
showed F1 stage at liver biopsy. In the study group, 106
patients reported alcohol intake ,50 g/day and harboured
genotype non-3. We also applied the model by Forns and
colleagues8 to these patients. AUROC was 0.77 (0.65–0.83).
Diagnostic accuracy for this analysis was:

(b) high cut off (.6.9): sensitivity 41%, specificity 98%, PPV
96%, and NPV 60%.
Twenty three (96%) of 24 patients with a score .6.9
showed significant fibrosis.
Using the APRI, for patients with a score ,0.5, 36 (33%) of
110 without significant fibrosis would be correctly classified
(table 4). Among the 48 patients with a score ,0.5, 12 (25%)
showed significant fibrosis (75% NPV). Seven showed F2,
four patients showed F3, and one patient F4 stage on liver
biopsy. For patients with a score .1.5, 78 (51%) of 153 with
significant fibrosis were correctly classified (table 4). Seventy
eight (89%) of 88 patients with a score .1.5 showed
significant fibrosis. Seven of 11 misclassified patients showed
F1 and three showed F0 stage on liver biopsy.
A total of 175 patients showed a score ,1.5 in the APRI. These
patients with indeterminate results were screened with the
Forns and colleagues8 index, and 21 (12%) showed a Forns score
.6.9. Two patients were misclassified. Thus the diagnostic
accuracy of the index of Forns and colleagues8 applied to APRI
indeterminate results (score ,1.5) was: sensitivity 25%,
specificity 98%, PPV 91%, and NPV 64%. Combining both
indexes, 109 (41%) patients could be spared from liver biopsy.
The diagnostic accuracy of the indexes was not affected by
HIV related variables. Patients with and without undetect￾able HIV RNA at the time of liver biopsy had an AUROC of
0.77 (0.70–0.82) and 0.75 (0.70–0.80) for the Forns model
and 0.80 (0.75–0.84) and 0.79 (0.73–0.82) for the APRI,
respectively. Patients with CD4+ cell counts (500 and .500
at the time of liver biopsy had an AUROC of 0.77 (0.72–0.84)
and 0.76 (0.71–0.82) for the Forns model and 0.79 (0.74–
0.83) and 0.79 (0.75–0.84) for the APRI, respectively.
Models aimed at predicting cirrhosis
AUROC values for these models are shown in table 3. The
models performed better for biopsy size >15 mm. Further
increases in biopsy length did not improve AUROC. Because
of this, patients with a liver biopsy length of at least 15 mm
were selected to validate these indexes.
For APRI, 126 (93%) of 135 patients with a score ,1 did
not have cirrhosis (table 5). Nine (23%) of 40 patients with
cirrhosis were classified falsely. For patients with a score .2,
21 (46%) of 46 had cirrhosis and 25 (11%) of 223 without
cirrhosis were identified falsely. PPV for both cut off points
was low (table 5).
For the Bonacini model,10 all 34 patients with a score below
the low cut off did not show cirrhosis (table 5). Twenty (29%)
of 68 patients with score above the high cut off had cirrhosis,
and 48 (16%) of 297 without cirrhosis were incorrectly
identified. PPV for both cut off points was low (table 5).
The AST/ALT ratio was not accurate in predicting the
absence or presence of cirrhosis (table 6). Platelet count,
using a cut off of 150 109
/l, allowed prediction of the absence
of cirrhosis with 92% certainty. The presence of cirrhosis was
predicted with 33% certainty (table 6).
DISCUSSION
In this study, we attempted to validate predictive models of
liver fibrosis previously estimated in HCV monoinfected
patients. We selected models based on data easily available,
which had been subject to internal or external validation. The
diagnostic accuracy of these models was lower in HIV/HCV
coinfected patients than in validation studies performed in
HCV monoinfected patients. However, simple fibrosis tests
may render liver biopsy unnecessary for deciding therapy
against HCV in over one third of patients with HIV infection
and chronic hepatitis C, as significant liver fibrosis may be
predicted in such patients.
Liver biopsy is an invasive technique with associated
morbidity and mortality6 and has a significant cost.7
Because of this, others have attempted to find accurate
non-invasive markers of liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C.
However, only two studies evaluated a models to predict liver
fibrosis in HIV infected patients with chronic hepatitis C, but

they were based on laboratory parameters not routinely
performed which limits their clinical applicability.15 16 In
addition, a cumbersome determination, only publicly avail￾able very recently, is involved in the calculation of the
Fibrotest. This model appears to identify correctly an
increased number of HIV/HCV coinfected patients with and
without significant hepatic fibrosis, potentially sparing half
of the patients from liver biopsy.15 This index has been subject
to external validation by independent authors in only one
study in patients with chronic hepatitis C without HIV
infection.19 Unfortunately, the diagnostic yield of the test was
not reproduced by these authors. A novel model, also based
on non-routinely used laboratory parameters, has recently
been elaborated in HIV/HCV coinfected patients.16 However,
this index was not validated in a separate group of patients
by the authors. In addition, the performance of the model did
not improve previous simpler indexes.
In the present study, the models aimed at discerning
significant from non-significant fibrosis reliably predicted the
presence of substantial fibrosis. Thus the model of Forns and
colleagues8 predicted the presence of significant fibrosis with
96% certainty, and only 4% of patients with a score .6.9
showed non-significant fibrosis. Similarly, the APRI pre￾dicted the presence of significant fibrosis with 91% certainty,
and misclassified 9% of patients with a score .1.5 who
showed F0 to F1 stage fibrosis on liver biopsy. Hence 27–34%
of patients would benefit from exclusion from liver biopsy as
a tool for deciding anti-HCV therapy. This represents one
third of patients potentially excluded from liver biopsy
compared with half of patients prevented from liver biopsy
in the original studies.8 9 If patients with indeterminate
results with the APRI are screened with the Forns model,8
40% of patients could be spared liver biopsy by combining
both models, as treatment for HCV could be indicated in
these cases.
The APRI has recently been validated in patients with
chronic hepatitis C with HIV infection.16 Among HIV
coinfected patients, AUROC was 0.71. Liver biopsy size
.10 mm was required by the authors in this study. This
poor result is in agreement with our findings as the APRI had
an AUROC value of 0.73 for liver biopsies >10 mm in our
study. We found that with larger liver biopsies as reference,
this and other indexes performed better. In this regard,
another recent study validated the APRI in patients with
chronic hepatitis C without HIV infection.20 At least six portal
tracts were required and mean length of the biopsy core was
19 mm. The AUROC of the APRI was 0.80, which is in
agreement with our results for larger liver biopsies. Thus the
potential variability of liver biopsy, whose diagnostic perfor￾mance is critically affected by sample size, probably
influenced the diagnostic yield of the indexes of fibrosis
found in previous studies.
The APRI, the Bonacini model,10 and platelet count showed
high levels of certainty in predicting the absence of cirrhosis.
This may be reassuring for patients and physicians but is of
little clinical use. Thus patients classified as not having
cirrhosis still need a liver biopsy for treatment decisions. In
contrast, these models did not confidently predict the
presence of cirrhosis, as the PPV was low. These disappoint￾ing results are in agreement with a recent survey on patients
without HIV infection.20
Liver biopsy was used as a reference for the diagnosis of
fibrosis. However, the accuracy of liver biopsy for assessing
fibrosis is limited by observer and sampling variability.
Several studies have assessed interobserver variability in the
evaluation of fibrosis. These surveys concluded that

reproducibility in staging fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C is
good, whatever the scoring system.21 In the present study,
interobserver variability was also low. In contrast, sampling
variability is more difficult to control. We evaluated the
performance of the indexes evaluated in this study for
different liver biopsy sizes. We observed that increasing the
liver biopsy size from 10 mm to 15 mm improved the
diagnostic yield but further increases did not provide better
yields. This is in accordance with a previous survey that
analysed discordant results between liver biopsy and markers
of fibrosis.22 In this study, patients categorised as staging
errors on liver biopsy showed smaller biopsy size. However,
larger biopsies, >15 mm or >25 mm, were similarly frequent
in patients with and without discordant results.
The patients included in this study may not be fully
representative of the HIV/HCV population. Only patients who
adhered to clinical visits and antiretroviral therapy were
selected for liver biopsy. In addition, patients were usually
scheduled to undergo liver biopsy only if they had been
abstinent from alcohol and other drugs, and HIV infection
was stable and under control. Thus there was a possible bias
towards patients with less advanced HIV infection and less
concomitant alcohol related liver disease. However, the
indexes evaluated in this study would probably have
performed worse in patients with these associated problems.
The presence of HIV infection changes the course of
chronic hepatitis C. Thus coinfected patients show acceler￾ated evolution of chronic hepatitis C, most probably related
to immunosuppression.2 These patients are exposed to
antiretroviral drugs that are associated with elevations in
transaminases, bilirubin, c-glutamyl-transpeptidase, and
cholesterol, all of which can distort the results of some
indexes. Moreover, antiretroviral therapy may alter the
course of liver fibrosis in HCV infection.23 24 However, analysis
of the study population stratified by CD4+ cell counts and
undetectable HIV RNA achieved with antiretroviral therapy
did not show changes in the performance of the indexes.
Indeed, inclusion of HIV related variables in the validation of
the Fibrotest in HIV/HCV coinfected patients did not improve
the diagnostic yield of the model.16
In conclusion, therapy for HCV may be decided without
liver biopsy evaluation of fibrosis in over one third of HIV
infected patients with chronic hepatitis C using simple
indexes. Absence of cirrhosis, but not its presence, and
significant liver fibrosis can be predicted with certainty in
most patients. However, these results clearly need improve￾ment. Hence achieving a non-invasive tool, readily available
at the bedside, to predict liver fibrosis in the setting of HIV/
HCV coinfection, still requires further investigation.
