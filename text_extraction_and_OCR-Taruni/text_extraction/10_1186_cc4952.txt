Abstract
Introduction Intensive care unit (ICU) patients often suffer from
subcutaneous oedema, due to administration of large fluid
volumes and the underlying pathophysiological condition. It is
unknown whether the presence of subcutaneous oedema
impairs the absorption of dalteparin, a low molecular weight
heparin, when it is given by subcutaneous administration for
venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. The objective of this
study is to compare the anti-Xa activity of dalteparin after
subcutaneous administration in ICU patients with and without
subcutaneous oedema.
Methods This non-randomized open parallel group follow-up
pilot study was conducted in two mixed medical-surgical
intensive care units at two teaching hospitals. Seven ICU
patients with subcutaneous oedema (index group) and seven
ICU patients without subcutaneous oedema (reference group)
were studied. Anti-Xa activity was determined at 0, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12
and 24 hours after subcutaneous administration of 2,500 IU
dalteparin. Plasma concentrations of factor anti-Xa activity were
measured using a chromogenic factor Xa inhibition assay.
Results The characteristics of the index group were: age, 58
years; male/female ratio, 5/2; body mass index at admission,
23.4 kg/m2 (at study day, 30.6 kg/m2). The characteristics of the
reference group were: age, 49 years; male/female ratio, 6/1;
body mass index at admission, 24.8 kg/m2 (at study day, 25.0
kg/m2). In the index group, creatinine clearance was lower
compared to the reference group (71 versus 131 ml/minute, p
= 0.003). Sequential organ failure assessment score did not
differ between index and reference groups (4 versus 5). Mean
arterial pressure was comparable between index and reference
groups (91 versus 95 mmHg) and within the normal range. The
mean Cmax value was not different between ICU patients with
and without subcutaneous oedema (0.15 ± 0.02 versus 0.14 ±
0.02 IU/ml, p = 0.34). In the index group, the mean AUC(0–24 h)
value was slightly higher compared with the reference group
(1.50 ± 0.31 versus 1.15 ± 0.25 h·IU/ml, p = 0.31). This
difference was not significant.
Conclusion In this pilot study, there was no clinically relevant
difference in anti-Xa activity after subcutaneous administration
of 2,500 IU dalteparin for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis
between ICU patients with and without subcutaneous oedema.
Critically ill patients seem to have lower anti-Xa activity levels
than healthy volunteers.
Introduction
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a frequent (10% to 80%)
complication in critically ill patients admitted to intensive care
units (ICUs) [1,2]. Critically ill patients have a higher risk of
VTE due to several risk factors such as increased age, recent
surgery, venous stasis as a result of prolonged immobilization,
acute infectious disease, hypercoagulability resulting from
acute phase responses, and vascular injury caused by central
venous catheters or other invasive interventions [1-3]. Most
ICU patients therefore receive thromboprophylaxis with
mechanical methods, unfractionated heparin or subcutaneous
low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) [2,4,5]. Several ran￾domized clinical trials and meta-analyses have demonstrated
that subcutaneous LMWHs are efficient and safe in the
AUC = area under the concentration curve; Cmax = maximal observed activity; ICU = intensive care unit; LMWH = low molecular weight heparin; MAP 
= mean arterial pressure; SD = standard deviation; SOFA = sequential organ failure assessment; VTE = venous thromboembolism.

prevention of VTE in surgical and medical patients [6-10]. Tri￾als in ICU patients have, however, rarely been conducted.
Patients in the ICU with shock symptoms often require large
volumes of fluid to maintain perfusion and thereby tissue oxy￾genation and to prevent multi-organ dysfunction syndrome.
Due to the administration of large volumes of fluid as well as
the underlying pathophysiological condition, ICU patients
often suffer from substantial subcutaneous oedema.
A number of factors might interfere with the effectiveness of
subcutaneous administrated LMWHs in critically ill patients,
such as low cardiac output, decreased peripheral blood flow,
use of vasopressors or subcutaneous oedema [11-14]. Sub￾cutaneous oedema may impair the absorption of medication
given by subcutaneous injection [15]. We postulate that the
absorption of subcutaneous dalteparin, a LMWH used for
thromboprophylaxis in our ICU, is impaired in patients with
subcutaneous oedema. This possible impairment may be due
to either a delayed absorption or to a reduced absorption.
Because it is difficult to measure LMWH concentrations
directly, pharmacokinetic studies generally use surrogate bio￾logical effect markers such as anti-Xa activity [16-22], which
has been shown to be correlated with the administrated dose
as well as, although more controversial, the clinical effect [23-
25].
To investigate whether indeed the absorption of dalteparin is
impaired in ICU patients with subcutaneous oedema, we com￾pared anti-Xa activity after subcutaneous injection of
dalteparin in ICU patients with subcutaneous oedema with
anti-Xa activity in ICU patients without subcutaneous oedema.
Materials and methods
This non-randomized open parallel group follow-up pilot study
was performed in the ICUs of the St Elisabeth Hospital and the
TweeSteden hospital in Tilburg, the Netherlands, from January
2003 until July 2005. Both ICUs served medical as well as sur￾gical patients. The medical ethics committee of the St Elisa￾beth Hospital approved the study protocol for both hospitals.

Inclusion criteria were ICU patients with age >18 years and
subcutaneous administration of dalteparin 2,500 IU once daily
for VTE prophylaxis. Exclusion criteria were concurrent use of
vitamin K antagonists, use of therapeutic doses of unfraction￾ated heparin or LMWHs, severe liver failure (bilirubin >40
µmol/l), renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <30 ml/
minute), signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation
(platelets <100 × 109/l, prolonged prothrombin time, and acti￾vated partial thromboplastin time), use of vasopressors and/or
inotropics. All patients or their legal representatives gave
informed consent before actual inclusion. After inclusion, the
measurements took place on a day the patient had used
dalteparin in the ICU unit for at least three days.
Two groups of patients were studied: ICU patients with sub￾cutaneous oedema (index group) and ICU patients without
subcutaneous oedema (reference group). Subcutaneous
oedema was defined as a weight gain of at least 10% com￾pared to the weight of the patient at admission and an appear￾ance of substantial generalized subcutaneous oedema. This
definition was chosen because we needed a measurement
that was easy to use in common practice and, to our knowl￾edge, there is no validated definition or measurement method
for oedema in ICU patients. Patients were weighed by means
of a 'weighing-bed'.
All patients received a subcutaneous injection of dalteparin
(Fragmin®, Pharmacia BV, Woerden, the Netherlands) that
was administrated by the nursing staff of the ICU using pre￾filled single-dose syringes (0.2 ml = 2,500 IU). The same tech￾nique and injection site, the abdomen or upper thigh, was used
in every patient.
Primary endpoint was the difference in anti-Xa activity
between index and reference group. On the study day, blood
samples were obtained immediately before and 3, 4, 6, 8, 12
and 24 hours after administration of dalteparin. Blood was
drawn by venipuncture. Each time 5 ml blood was collected in
sodium citrate (0.109 M, 3.2%) tubes and sent to the labora￾tory as soon as possible. There, plasma was separated from
cells by centrifugation (3,000 rpm for 10 minutes) and plasma
was stored at -20°C for a maximum period of one month.
Plasma concentrations of factor anti-Xa activity were meas￾ured with an ACL3000 instrument (Instrumentation Laboratory
BV, Breda, The Netherlands) using a chromogenic factor Xa
inhibition assay (Spectrolyse®Heparin Xa, Trinity Biotech, Ire￾land). The anti-Xa assay standard calibration curve of
dalteparin ranged from 0.0 IU/ml to 0.8 IU/ml. The within assay
and among assay precision (coefficient of variation) was, for
0.1 IU/ml heparin, 8.0% and 8.9%, respectively, and, for 0.5
IU/ml heparin, 3.7% and 6.6%, respectively.
A concentration-time curve of anti-Xa activity was determined
for all patients. For each patient, the Cmax, the maximum
observed activity, was estimated from the anti-Xa concentra￾tion curve and the AUC(0–24 h), the area under the concentra￾tion curve at 0 to 24 hours, was calculated by the trapezoidal
rule. Of these measurements, we calculated the mean plasma
concentrations of anti-Xa activity and mean Cmax and AUC0–24
h for both groups.
In addition, the following data were collected from the medical
history of the patient: age, sex, weight (at admission and at
study day), length, sequential organ failure assessment
(SOFA) score at study day, and mean arterial pressure (MAP)
at study day and diagnosis. On the study day, urine output
over a 24 hour period was collected for determination of the
creatinine clearance.
We calculated that seven evaluable patients were needed in
each group to prove a difference of 50% in anti-Xa activity. We
considered a difference of 50% in anti-Xa activity, in either
AUC0–24 h or Cmax, to be clinically relevant. This was based on
the assumption of a Cmax in healthy volunteers of 0.22 (stand￾ard deviation (SD) 0.07) IU/ml and an AUC0–24 h of 1.26 (SD
0.40) h·IU/ml [17] and a desired power of 80% and α of 5%.
Comparison of continuous variables was done by Students t
test. The anti-Xa activity (Cmax and AUC(0–24 h)) was compared
by the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test (mean ± SD). A p
value of 0.05 is taken as cut-off for statistical significance.
Results
During the study period, all patients at the ICUs were
screened to fulfill inclusion criteria. Most patients were
excluded because they were on vasopressor or inotropic med￾ication. Finally, seven patients in the index group and seven
patients in the reference group were included. Demographic
and clinical characteristics of the patients are listed in Table 1.
The distribution of age, sex, length, weight and body mass
index (at admission) were not different between the two
groups. All patients received respiratory support. Weight and
body mass index at study day was higher, as expected, in the
index group, because of the at least 10% weight gain in
patients with subcutaneous oedema that was required for
inclusion. In ICU patients with subcutaneous oedema, creati￾nine clearance was lower compared with ICU patients without
subcutaneous oedema (71 ml/minute versus 131 ml/minute, p
= 0.003). The SOFA score did not differ between the index
and the reference group. MAP, used as an estimate of ade￾quacy of tissue perfusion, was within the normal range in both
groups (80 to 100 mmHg). The diagnoses varied between the
two groups. Patients in the index group had a diagnosis of
sepsis more often (four times) than patients in the reference
group (zero times). As mentioned, none of the patients used
vasopressors or inotropics.
The results of anti-Xa activity measured for the two groups are
given in Table 2 and Figure 1. Peak anti-Xa activity (Cmax) is the
anti-Xa activity three hours after administration of dalteparin

(Figure 1). Mean Cmax and AUC(0–24 h) values are listed in Table
3. The mean Cmax value was not different between ICU
patients with and without subcutaneous oedema (0.15 IU/ml
and 0.14 IU/ml, respectively; p = 0.34). In the index group the
mean AUC(0–24 h) value was slightly higher compared with the
reference group (1.50 h·IU/ml versus 1.15 h·IU/ml, p = 0. 31).
This difference is not significant.
Discussion
For non-intravenous, parenteral routes of drug administration,
such as subcutaneous injection, decreased peripheral (cuta￾neous) blood flow, changes in local pH, oedema and scar tis￾sue may alter the extent of absorption [14]. In one study the
absorption of subcutaneous administrated insulin was signifi￾cantly lower and delayed in patients with generalized subcuta￾neous oedema [15]. Therefore, we considered it possible that
the absorption of dalteparin, administrated by subcutaneous
injection for prophylaxis of VTE, might be influenced by subcu￾taneous oedema, very often seen in ICU patients with shock
symptoms. In this study, we cannot confirm this hypothesis.
Mean plasma concentrations of anti-Xa activity are compara￾ble in ICU patients with and without subcutaneous oedema.
The pharmacokinetics of dalteparin is linear and dose-inde￾pendent for anti-Xa activity. Absorption is rate-limiting after
subcutaneous administration and peak plasma concentrations
are attained after 2.8 to 4 hours. Bioavailability after subcuta￾neous injection is close to 90%. The apparent volume of dis￾tribution is close to the plasma volume. Elimination appears to
occur mainly via the renal route, with a plasma elimination half￾life of 2.4 to 4 hours [17,18]. The mean Cmax values of 0.15 IU/
ml and 0.14 IU/ml found in the index and the reference groups,
respectively, are lower than the assumed Cmax value in healthy
volunteers of 0.22 IU/ml. The mean AUC(0–24 h) value of 1.15
h·IU/ml in ICU patients without subcutaneous oedema is also
lower than the demonstrated AUC(0–24 h) value in healthy vol￾unteers (1.26 h·IU/ml) [17]. This can be an indication of lower
anti-Xa activity levels in critically ill patients. Others find this as
well [11,12,26,27]. Dörffler-Melly [11] and colleagues demon￾strated lower anti-Xa activity in ICU patients on vasopressors.
The use of vasopressors, they explain, leads to adrenergic
vasoconstriction of the peripheral blood vessels and thus
impaired perfusion of the subcutaneous tissue. This was the
reason to exclude patients on vasopressors and/or inotropics
from our study. Priglinger and colleagues [12] showed lower
anti-Xa levels in critically ill patients compared with medical
patients in the normal ward. They did not find a correlation

between the dose of norepinephrine and the anti-Xa activity.
Priglinger and colleagues [12] and Freedman [13] mention
altered cardiac output, pre-existing conditions and also use of
vasopressors and decreased peripheral blood flow as possi￾ble reasons for lower anti-Xa activity in ICU patients. Mayr and
colleagues [26] demonstrated very low anti-Xa levels in inten￾sive care patients, especially in patients with high multi-organ
dysfunction syndrome score and high body weight. And a
recent study by Rutherford and colleagues [27] showed sub￾therapeutic trough levels of anti-Xa activity in critically ill
trauma and surgical patients after once daily 40 mg enoxaparin
by subcutaneous injection for deep venous thrombosis
prophylaxis.
Critical illness may alter absorption, volume of distribution and
clearance of drugs used in ICU patients and these alterations
may have additive or opposing effects on drug exposure, elim￾ination and half-life [14]. In contrast to unfractionated heparin,
only a minor portion of LMWH binds to acute phase proteins
and endothelial cells. Whether the bioavailability of LMWHs
decreases during an acute phase response, as it can be found
in critically ill patients, is unknown [12,26]. These and other
combinations of complex pathophysiological characteristics of
the ICU patient may account for the lower anti-Xa concentra￾tion in our ICU patients.
In our study, the two groups are well matched in terms of age,
sex, length, weight and body mass index at admission. As
there was no difference in MAP between the two groups, tis￾sue hypoperfusion was not a confounding variable. The SOFA
score (0 to 24) is useful to assess organ dysfunction or failure
and to evaluate morbidity. It can be used to characterize
groups of patients for comparison in trials [28,29]. The SOFA
scores were equal in the index and reference groups, indicat￾ing comparability in morbidity between both groups. The two
groups do not match in terms of creatinine clearance. The cre￾atinine clearance in the index group is lower compared to the
reference group (71 ml/minute versus 131 ml/minute).
LMWHs can accumulate in patients with renal failure. It is
known from the literature that renal insufficiency does not have
any influence on Cmax and apparent volume of distribution of
LMWHs, but significantly prolongs clearance and increased
half-life [16,19,30,31]. It looks like the elimination half-life was
shorter in the reference group compared to the index group
(Figure 1). This may have contributed to the slightly higher
AUC(0–24 h) in the index group. However, no patients had a cre￾atinine clearance of less than 30 ml/minute. The difference in
AUC(0–24 h) is more likely due to the large inter-patient variabil￾ity in anti-Xa concentrations after subcutaneous administration
of 2,500 IU dalteparin (Table 2). The measurements of anti-Xa
activity are in the lower part of the calibration curve; some of
the data are below the detection limit (0.10 IU/ml). The reliabil￾Figure 1

ity of the assay might be less in this part of the curve and may
have contributed to the large inter-patient variability in the data
and so to the higher AUC(0–24 h) in the index group. The AUC(0–
12 h) and AUC(0–8 h), in which the lower concentrations play a
less important role, were more comparable between the index
and the reference group (0.90 and 0.71 IU/ml for the index
group and 0.75 and 0.63 IU/ml for the reference group,
respectively). High variability among patients in anti-Xa activity,
however, has been reported by others [31]. The complex
pathophysiological characteristics of the ICU patient may have
played a roll in this as well.
When interpreting the results of this study, some other points
must be taken into consideration. This is a pilot study with only
a small number of patients. A relatively long inclusion period
was needed to meet enrollment of the required number of
patients not on vasopressors and/or inotropics. With our sam￾ple size calculation we considered a difference of 50% in anti￾Xa activity to be clinically relevant. To prove that difference, we
only needed a small number of patients, seven in each group.
With a larger number of patients we might have been able to
prove a less than 50% difference in anti-Xa activity between
the two groups.
Although commonly used to monitor anticoagulant effective￾ness of LMWHs, lower anti-Xa levels do not necessarily mean
that critically ill patients are insufficiently protected against
VTE using the subcutaneous route of administration [23-25].
To adequately answer that question would take a much larger
efficacy study with a different endpoint, such as the presence
of VTE instead of anti-Xa levels. Besides this, there are other
mechanisms by which LMWHs influence haemostasis. These
other mechanisms include inhibition of thrombin activity, inhi￾bition of platelet function and, possibly, enhancement of fibri￾nolytic activity. Thus, anti-Xa activity may be a marker of
LMWHs, which may or may not be causally related to the clin￾ical outcomes [13,23,25]. It will be interesting to investigate,
as Freedman also mentioned, the intravenous route of admin￾istration of LMWHs for thromboprophylaxis in critically ill
patients and determine anti-Xa activity and efficacy [13].
Besides these limitations, this study is, to our knowledge, the
first to investigate the influence of subcutaneous oedema on
the absorption of LMWHs in the critically ill patient. Subcuta￾neous oedema is a common problem in the ICU patient. Not￾withstanding the difficult patient population, we have managed
to include comparable ICU patients in both groups. ICU
patients have a complex pathophysiology that can influence
the pharmacology of different drugs. It is important to investi￾gate parts of this potential problem so we can optimize the use
of drugs in critically ill patients.
Conclusion
In this pilot study there was no clinically relevant difference in
anti-Xa activity after subcutaneous administration of 2,500 IU
dalteparin for VTE prophylaxis between ICU patients with and
without subcutaneous oedema. Critically ill patients, however,
seem to have lower anti-Xa activity levels than healthy volun￾teers. Whether these lower anti-Xa activities also translate into
higher prevalence of thromboembolic events is still unclear.
Further studies are necessary to identify the proper dose and
route of application of LMWHs for VTE prophylaxis in the crit￾ically ill patient.

Key messages
• ICU patients often suffer from subcutaneous oedema 
and it is unknown whether this oedema impairs the 
absorption of LMWHs given by subcutaneous injection.
• We found no difference in anti-Xa activity after subcuta￾neous administration of 2,500 IU dalteparin for VTE 
prophylaxis between ICU patients with and without 
oedema.
• Critically ill patients seem to have lower anti-Xa activity 
levels than healthy volunteers.
