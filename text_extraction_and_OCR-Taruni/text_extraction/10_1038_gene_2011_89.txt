We fine mapped two primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) risk loci, CLEC16A (C-type lectin domain family 16 member A)--suppressor
of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) and Spi-B protein (SPIB) and sequenced a locus, sialic acid acetylesterase (SIAE), proposed to
harbor autoimmunity-associated mutations. In all, 1450 PBC cases and 2957 healthy controls were genotyped for 84
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the CLEC16A-SOCS1 and SPIB loci. All 10 exons of the SIAE gene were
resequenced in 381 cases and point substitutions of unknown significance assayed for activity and secretion. Fine mapping
identified 26 SNPs across the CLEC16A-SOCS1 and 11 SNPs across the SPIB locus with significant association to PBC, the
strongest signals at the CLEC16A-SOCS1 locus emanating from a SOCS1 intergenic SNP (rs243325; P ¼ 9.91  109
) and at the
SPIB locus from a SPIB intronic SNP (rs34944112; P ¼ 3.65  109
). Among the associated SNPs at the CLEC16A-SOCS1 locus,
two within the CLEC16A gene as well as one SOCS1 SNP (rs243325) remained significant after conditional logistic regression and
contributed independently to risk. Sequencing of the SIAE gene and functional assays of newly identified variants revealed
six patients with functional non-synonymous SIAE mutations (Fisher’s P ¼ 9  104 vs controls) We demonstrate independent
effects on risk of PBC for CLEC16A, SOCS1 and SPIB variants, while identifying functionally defective SIAE variants as
potential factors in risk for PBC.

INTRODUCTION
Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a chronic and progressive biliary
disease, characterized by a destructive granulomatous cholangitis
and loss of tolerance to ubiquitous mitochondrial antigens.1
Epidemiological data indicate important interactions between
environmental and genetic factors in PBC predisposition and
cumulative biological data identify an interplay of adaptive and
innate immunity as integral to disease pathogenesis.2 However,
despite the well-recognized roles for immune cell populations in
PBC pathophysiology, understanding of the molecular pathways
underpinning PBC remains limited and needs to be improved.3
Results of genome-wide association surveys (GWAS) confirmed
association of PBC not only with the previously known human
leukocyte antigen class II locus, but also many other novel non￾human leukocyte antigen loci encompassing genes involved in
immunity.4 Thus, for example, the first GWAS data set and follow￾up studies available for PBC identified not only the IL12A gene, but
also genes encoding other components of the interleukin-12
(IL-12) signaling pathway (IL12RB2 and STAT4) as well as the
interferon response factor 5 gene as PBC risk loci. These findings
have since been replicated and extended.5 - 8 Importantly, these
data also identify many of the immune-related loci conferring risk
for PBC to be shared with rheumatoid arthritis, celiac disease,
systemic lupus erythematosus and other autoimmune diseases that
appear with increased frequency in PBC patients and their families.
Although some of the non-human leukocyte antigen PBC risk loci
containing immunologically relevant genes have been subjected to
further analyses, several of the more recently identified susceptibility
regions remain relatively uncharacterized. Two such immunologi￾cally relevant loci that we have prioritized, include the CLEC16A (C￾type lectin domain family 16 member A) --SOCS1 (suppressor of
cytokine signaling 1) locus at chromosome 16p13 and the Spi-B
protein (SPIB) locus at chromosome 19q13. At the CLEC16A-SOCS1
locus, for example, CLEC16A (aka KIAA0350) encodes a tyrosine￾based activation motif-containing protein with likely effects on
immune cell signaling,9 while the SOCS1 gene product has integral
roles in modulating cytokine and toll-like receptor-driven signaling
pathways that regulate immune responsiveness.10,11 The CLEC16A￾SOCS1 locus has already been implicated in risk for celiac disease,12
multiple sclerosis,13 Type 1 diabetes9 and immunoglobulin A
deficiency14 and its association with PBC as well was initially
flagged at a low level of significance by a Canadian PBC GWAS

analysis and then formally statistically demonstrated in a UK-based
PBC GWAS. However, in the former of these two studies, the single￾nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) giving the strongest association
signal was located just upstream of the SOCS1 gene, while in the
latter, the most significant SNP at this locus was located in the
CLEC16A gene, which maps over 70 kb upstream of SOCS1. This
locus is genetically complex, and in multiple sclerosis a recent
study based on linkage disequilibrium patterns in the region and
logistic regression analysis, suggested that this region harbors
independent disease risk loci.15 SPIB is also a plausible candidate
gene for PBC based on both GWAS data and data implicating the
SPIB protein in both B-cell antigen receptor signaling and
development of T cells and of plasmacytoid dendritic cells involved
in inflammatory responses.7,8 This locus has not, however,
emerged as a risk locus for autoimmune diseases other than PBC.
Knowledge of specific risk relevant genes underpinning PBC
remains limited and one factor thought to be important are
contributions to risk from rare gene variants not amenable to
discovery via conventional GWAS, but requiring costly sequencing
efforts. This possibility is strongly supported by the recent
discovery of rare variants in the sialic acid acetylesterase (SIAE)
gene that occur significantly more frequently in patients with
rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and multiple
sclerosis than in healthy controls.16 The SIAE enzyme, which
removes 9-O-acetyl moieties from sialic acid, has been indepen￾dently implicated in autoimmunity by the immunological pheno￾type of SIAE-deficient mice and by its potential to regulate B-cell
immune responses via 9-O-acetylation of a-2,6-linked glycans that
modulate activity of the CD22 B-cell inhibitory receptor.17 This
finding has not been extensively pursued, although a Met89Val
variant was not associated with type 1 diabetes mellitus and
Graves’ disease in one study of a Polish population.18
Through high-density genotyping across the CLEC16A-SOCS1
and SPIB loci and direct sequencing across the SIAE locus, we
identify multiple disease variants across the CLEC16A-SOCS1 and
SPIB loci and show that variants within each of the CLEC16A and
SOCS1 gene contribute independently to the risk for PBC. We
additionally demonstrate the presence of functional variants in
the SIAE gene in patients with PBC.
RESULTS
Evidence for independent association of CLEC16A and SOCS1
variants with risk for PBC
In our initial PBC GWAS analysis, we found suggestive, but not
significant, evidence for PBC association with the CLEC16A-SOCS1
locus, with a SNP (rs243324) located about 5.5 kb upstream of the
SOCS1 coding sequence giving the strongest association in the
region. This locus failed to achieve genome-wide significance in
our analysis, but was also identified in a subsequent UK-based PBC
GWAS. In this latter study, the most significant SNP mapped to
intron 19 of CLEC16A, about 166 kb upstream of the SOCS1 gene.
To better ascertain the source of the association signal at this
locus, we genotyped our full study cohort (1450 cases and 2967
controls) for 57 SNPs spanning a 450-kb genomic region
encompassing the CLEC16A and SOCS1 genes as well as several
very small genes, transitional protein 2 and protamine 1-3, that
map about 12 kb downstream of SOCS1 (Table 1). From this
analysis, 26 SNPs achieved the significance thresholds set for this
study (Po104
), with the strongest association signal
(P ¼ 9.91  10 9
; odds ratio (OR) ¼ 1.33; 95% confidence interval
(CI) ¼ 1.21 -- 1.47) deriving from the rs243325 SNP located about
5 kb upstream of the SOCS1 gene start codon and about 65 kb
downstream of CLEC16A (Table 1, Figure 1 and Supplementary

Table 1). In all, 15 other SNPS flanking the SOCS1 gene region, 7
SNPs in or near the TPN2 and protamine genes and 10 SNPs within
various CLEC16A gene introns also achieved nominal significance
and analysis of the linkage disequilibrium patterns among the
markers revealed these SNPs to constitute three major haplotype
blocks, two across the CLEC16A gene and the third, a 27-kb region,
encompassing the SOCS1, transitional protein 2 and protamine
genes (Supplementary Figure 1). Importantly, this analysis
revealed the most strongly associated SNP in the single-point
analysis (rs243325) to be in strong linkage disequilibrium with five
other disease-associated SNPs mapping 30 to SOCS1 (pairwise r
2
ranging between 0.66 and 0.93 and D0 between 0.88 and 0.99).
Within the two haplotype blocks across the CLEC16A gene, the
strongest association signal (P ¼ 4.85  107
, OR ¼ 1.46) came
from the rs58102322 SNP located in intron 18. The rs12924729
SNP initially reported in the UK PBC GWAS8 was also among the
significant SNPs at this locus (P ¼ 6.73  106
, OR ¼ 1.25), but
shows negligible LD with rs58102322 and maps within a distinct
haplotype block within the gene.
To investigate the extent to which SNPs within the SOCS1 vs the
CLEC16A haplotype block contribute to the disease association at
this locus, conditional logistic regression analysis was undertaken,
with each of the test SNPs conditioned on the effect of the other
SNPs. Three SNPs, rs58102322 and rs12924129 (intronic variants in
the CLEC16A) and rs243325 (SOCS1 50 intergenic region) remained
significant after conditioning sequentially on the most significant
markers (Supplementary Table 2) strongly suggesting that there
are multiple independent variants influencing PBC risk in this
region. This conclusion is consistent with results of haplotype
analyses incorporating these three risk loci (Table 2A), which
reveal effects on risk for this locus (omnibus test: P ¼ 2.61  1014)
and for a risk allele haplotype (AAG, P ¼ 5.36  108
; OR ¼ 1.67)
and a protective allele haplotype (GGA, P ¼ 3.93  1010;
OR ¼ 0.52) at the locus to be much stronger than for any single
SNP or any other allele combination at these three loci. Thus at
this locus, risk associated with PBC appears to be largely
determined by complementary haplotypes, which might reflect
effects from as-of-yet unidentified single variant(s) or from
epistatic interactions among the three loci.
To further explore the relative influence of these variants on
disease susceptibility, the combined contribution of the three risk
alleles at the rs12924729 (G), rs58102322 (A) and rs243325 (A) loci
was also explored using logistic regression analysis (Table 2B). For
this analysis, the effect of carrying risk genotypes at the CLEC16A
gene rs12924729 and rs58102322 loci was evaluated in the
context of presence or absence of the risk genotypes at the SOCS1
rs243325 locus. The results revealed the OR to be significantly
increased by combining carriage of rs12924729 and rs58102322
risk alleles with (OR ¼ 3.66; 95% CI ¼ 1.58 -- 8.46; P ¼ 0.002)
compared with without (OR ¼ 2.60; 95% CI ¼ 1.00 -- 6.77; P ¼ 0.05)
rs243325 risk alleles. When compared with all the other allele
combinations, the combination of all three risk alleles has an effect
size, 1.57 (95% CI ¼ 1.28 -- 1.94), higher than that of any individual
SNP at this locus. Thus, addition of the rs243325 risk allele to the
other two risk alleles substantially increases risk for disease as is in
keeping with independent effects of these alleles on risk.
Fine mapping of the PBC-associated SPIB locus
To refine and further validate the SPIB locus, we genotyped all
cases and controls for 27 SNPs across an B60-kb region
encompassing the SPIB gene and two other genes, polymerase
delta 1 and myosin-binding protein 2 that map 1 kb upstream and
3.9 kb downstream, respectively, of SPIB. This analysis identified 11
SNPs at this locus to be significantly associated with PBC, 3 of
which achieved P-values o5  108 (Table 3, Supplementary
Table 3; Figure 2) and almost all of which map within one of two
haplotype blocks across the region (Supplementary Figure 2). The
most significant SNP at this locus was an intronic polymorphism,
rs34944112 (P ¼ 3.65  109
; OR ¼ 1.49, 95% CI ¼ 1.31 -- 1.70),
which was in strong LD (r
2 ¼ 0.96; D0 ¼ 0.98) with another
significantly associated SNP, the rs3745516 SNP identified as a
PBC risk locus in the previous GWAS studies (P ¼ 1.93  107
;
OR ¼ 1.30). To further explore the contributions of these SNPs to
the association signal, conditional logistic regression analysis was
then performed again incorporating all test SNPs in the analysis.
After conditioning on each marker, only the most significantly
associated SNP in the region, rs34944112 remained strongly
significant (Supplementary Table 4), the power for detecting an
ORX1.3 being 490%. These findings suggest that this variant
functions independently to confer much of the effect on risk at
this locus.
Functionally deleterious SIAE gene mutations and PBC
To assess whether SIAE gene variants are relevant to risk for PBC,
we resequenced all 10 exons of this gene in 381 unrelated
individuals randomly chosen from our cohort of PBC cases. Results
of this analysis revealed a total of 12 point substitutions among
the patients, 6 of which were non-synonymous changes that were
found in 10 of 381 cases but that occurred only once in 648
controls (Table 4); P ¼ 0.0003. Among the non-synonymous
polymorphisms, two encode SIAE protein species, F404S and
T312M, previously shown to be catalytically defective and one
encodes a species, M89V, reported to be catalytically intact (but
not secreted). By contrast, three other polymorphisms detected in
the patients encode variants, F199C, P356L and Q382R, that have
not been previously described and have unknown functional
effects.
To allow assessment of the frequency at which biologically
relevant SIAE variants occur in PBC patients, we next explored the
functional properties of the F199C, P365L and Q382R species. To
this end, cDNAs encoding each of these proteins as well as the
wild-type SIAE protein or a known catalytically dead SIAE mutant
(S127A) were expressed in 293T cells and esterase activity of anti￾SIAE immunoprecipitates from these cells then assayed. To screen
for a secretory defect, SIAE levels were also assessed in culture
supernatants and compared between the supernatants and
lysates. Results of these analyses revealed catalytic activity to be
severely reduced for the F199C variant, but essentially normal for
the Q382R and P356L variant proteins (Figure 3). The F199C

data for genotyped SNPs are shown for the SOCS1 loci. Both current

protein was also poorly secreted into culture supernatants. Thus, one
of the three variants, F199C appears to be functionally defective.
On the basis of these findings and the sequence data revealing
presence of the F199C variant in 3 of our PBC cases, and variants
encoding other functionally impaired SIAE species in 3 more
subjects, it appears that 6 of the 381 cases tested here have a
functionally defective SIAE variant, and 2 further patients are
homozygote for a secretory defective variant. By contrast, in 648
healthy Caucasian controls of European descent, functionally
relevant SIAE variants were identified in only two individuals and
in 1351 samples of European American origin for which SIAE exome
sequencing data are available (http://snp.gs.washington.edu/EVS/),

one further control with a functionally relevant SIAE variant was
identified. Therefore in contrast to our PBC patients, in whom 6 of
381 have functional mutations, only 3 of 1999 controls (648 from our
study, 1351 from the Exome Sequencing Project data), carry
functional SIAE variants (P¼ 9 104
; Fisher’s exact test).
DISCUSSION
Our current study in which we focus on further refining non￾human leukocyte antigen association with PBC, builds on recent
data pinpointing the CLEC16A-SOCS1 and SPIB loci as risk loci for
PBC and that identifying SIAE gene variants as risk alleles for
several autoimmune diseases. Our findings confirm the presence
of disease-associated SNPs across the CLEC16A-SOCS1 and SPIB
gene loci and identify a number of new potential PBC markers at
each of these loci. We also demonstrate that 10 of the 381 PBC
cases studied here carry non-synonymous point substitutions in
the SIAE gene, 2 of which were previously shown to encode
functionally defective proteins (F199C and T312M) and 1 of which
was identified for the first time in this study and shown here to
encode catalytically impaired protein (F199C). Other variants were
also detected in the patients, including one other, which was the
only variant found in the homozygous state and, which has been
shown previously to encode a secretory defective, but functional
protein (M89V). These results thus provide the first evidence for a
potential role of SIAE variants in PBC.
The current data confirm PBC association with the CLEC16A￾SOCS1 locus and the statistical data gleaned from conditional,
haplotype and combination analyses provide compelling evidence
for independent contributions of CLEC16A and SOCS1 alleles to risk
of developing PBC. This conclusion is consistent with the well￾recognized role for SOCS1 and likely role for CLEC16A in immune
regulation. SOCS1 is a well-established immune cell signaling
inhibitor that functions downstream of cytokine receptors to
inhibit JAK-STAT-mediated induction of interferon-g, IL-2, IL-6, IL-4
and tumor necrosis factor-a and many other proinflammatory
cytokines.19 Mice lacking SOCS1 protein thus exhibit cellular
hyperreactivity to many such cytokines and rapidly develop a
multi-organ inflammatory disease associated with profound
activation of hepatic lymphocytes and death by age 3 weeks
due to fulminating hepatitis.20,21 Specific loss of SOCS1 in
hepatocytes also renders mice more susceptible to ConA-induced
hepatitis,22 while SOCS1-specific deletion in T cells promotes Th1,
but impairs Th17 cell development.23 Thus, SOCS1 regulates T-cell
differentiation pathways that are integral to maintenance of
immune cell homeostasis. Roles for both SOCS1 and CLEC16A
variants in PBC are thus in keeping with genetic association data
implicating this locus in other autoimmune diseases and with the
cumulative biological understanding of the two proteins.
The SPIB locus was initially revealed as a likely PBC risk locus by
our GWAS data showing an association signal that just missed
genome-wide significance (P ¼ 9.12 107
; OR¼ 1.27) at the
rs3745516 SNP locus within a SPIB gene intron.6 Strong evidence
for this gene’s association with PBC was then provided by a follow￾up meta-analysis of Italian and Canadian GWAS data7 and a
subsequent UK PBC GWAS.8 Our current findings provide added
evidence for SPIB involvement in PBC, revealing strong association
of several intronic SNPs with risk and suggesting this locus’s effect
on risk to be primarily attributable to the most significant variant at
this locus, rs34944112. Interestingly, another significant association
signal from the region came from the rs11546996 SNP, which
encodes an alanine to proline substitution in exon 4 of the SPIB
gene. This conservative substitution, however, would be expected
to have little functional relevance, a prediction consistent with the
conditional analysis results showing no independent effect of this
SNP on risk. Defining the disease-causal SNP at this locus will
require further biological studies, but an effect of the SPIB-encoded
Spi-B transcription factor on risk is in keeping with its prerequisite
role in regulating both lineage commitment during haematopoiesis
and differentiation of mature lymphocyte and dendritic cell
populations.24,25 The SPIB gene is also of particular potential
interest as this locus has not, as of yet, been implicated in other
autoimmune diseases and may prove to represent a PBC-specific
risk locus. This possibility and the definition of the disease relevant
allele at this locus, however, require further investigation through
expanded genetic and functional studies.
In contrast to most of the gene loci now implicated in PBC
susceptibility, SIAE emerged as a candidate gene for PBC in the
context of a resequencing screen for SIAE variants in other
autoimmune diseases. Involvement of this gene in such diseases
was initially suggested by the enhanced B-cell activation and
auto-antibody production observed in SIAE-deficient mice and

extent of linkage disequilibrium with the most significant
polymorphisms is indicated by the size of each data point; larger
data points indicate stronger linkage disequilibrium. Gene positions

was then confirmed by the demonstration of functionally
deleterious SIAE gene mutations in patients with rheumatoid
arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and multiple sclerosis.16,17
One very limited replication study in type 1 diabetes and Graves
disease was negative,18 although our systematic SIAE resequen￾cing and functional data obtained in this study do reveal a small
number of the PBC patients tested to have loss-of-function SIAE
missense mutations. As genotype data were not available for our
full case population, genome-wide findings were not adjusted for
population stratification. However, an association of SIAE variants
with PBC, as suggested by our data, is consistent with the not
infrequent occurrence in PBC patients and their families of other
autoimmune diseases (rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus
erythematosus) known to be associated with SIAE variants. In our
study, for example, 8 of the 10 PBC cases with a functional SIAE
variant and/or a family member had one or more other
autoimmune diseases. The concordance between PBC and other
autoimmune diseases implies that observed PBC-gene associa￾tions may also reflect the presence of these other diseases.
Sequencing studies of a much larger case/control cohort are
needed to address this possibility and better delineate the
frequency, repertoire and cellular consequences of rare variants
in PBC and the interactions of such variants with more common
variants in predisposing to PBC vs other autoimmune disease.
The SIAE locus has not been specifically implicated in PBC by
prior reports. For this reason and also because there are little data
on the contribution of rare variants to risk for autoimmune
disease, we believe the demonstrated association of PBC with SIAE
variants adds an important new dimension to the genetic
understanding of such conditions. Similarly, while implicated in
risk for PBC as well as other autoimmune diseases, the CLEC16A￾SOCS1 locus association with PBC had not been replicated before
this study and there are no published data that refine this GWAS￾defined risk locus. The data reported here thus provide new
insights into the genetic basis of PBC and a framework for further
studies using larger cohorts to address potential correlations of
the gene variants reported here to PBC subphenotypes such as
anti-mitochondrial antibodies status and severity.
Collectively, our current findings are in keeping with key roles
for multiple immune-related genes in PBC and provide more
evidence of overlap between some, but not all PBC risk alleles and
those reported for other autoimmune diseases. Our data also
begin the process of identifying contributory effects of rare
missense mutations to risk for PBC and thus highlight the need to
search for additional risk alleles by more extensive resequencing
endeavors in extremely large case --control cohorts.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects
The subject cohort studied here included 1450 PBC cases and 2967
controls. Another 648 ‘historic’ controls served as a source for data on SIAE
variant frequency in healthy controls.16 Clinical characteristics of the
patients have been previously reported,5,6 but all were diagnosed with PBC
according to the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease
guidelines.1 All study subjects as well as historic controls were of Caucasian
European descent and were ascertained from either the Canada, USA or
Europe. The Local Institutional Review Committee provided approval for
conduct of this study, and all individuals gave their informed consent.
CLEC16A-SOCS1 and SPIB SNP selection and genotyping
SNPs initially tested across the 16p13 and 19q13 risk loci were selected
based on at least one of the following criteria: (1) Hap Map Phase III data
identifying the SNP as a Tag SNP with minor allele frequency 40.01. and r
2
threshold of 0.8) and/or (2) localization within 150 kb upstream or
downstream of the SNPs at each locus most significantly associated with
PBC in our GWAS and GWAS meta-analysis. Genotyping was performed
Figure 3. Functional analysis of newly identified SIAE variants. SIAE cDNAs encoding Flag-tagged versions of wild-type SIAE, a catalytically inert
SIAE mutation (S127A) and three SIAE variants of unknown functional significance (F199C, P356L and Q382R) were expressed in 293 cells, the
cell lysates and culture supernatants harvested 48 h later and immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody (‘control’ refers to untransfected
cells). Immunoprecipitates were split into two equivalent aliquots with one used in immunoblotting to quantitate SIAE levels and the second
used to assay for esterase activity on a fluorogenic substrate. Anti-Flag antibody immunoblotting analysis of cell lysates and supernatants from
293 transfected cells is shown in the upper panel. Bottom left panel shows esterase activity of each SIAE species normalized for lysate SIAE
protein levels and bottom right panel shows ratios of SIAE levels in culture supernatant relative to lysate. Each variant was tested three times
and the data are shown as mean±s.e.m.16

using the Sequenom MassArray iPLEX platform (San Diego, CA, USA) with
allele-extension products plated onto a SpectroCHIP and subjected to mass
spectrometry and the genotypes then called using SpectroCALLER software
(Sequenom). SNP annotation was based on NCBI dbSNP Build 129.
SIAE gene sequencing
DNA was prepared by the standard phenol/chloroform extraction from
genomic DNA of each subject. All 10 exons of the SIAE gene were then
amplified by PCR using previously reported intronic primer pairs covering
the 50 and 30 splice sites of each exon16 and the amplicons then subjected
to bidirectional automated sequencing using an Applied Biosystems 3730
DNA analyzer (Carlsbad, CA, USA). Sequence alignment and polymorphism
identification were carried out using Sequencher 4.10.1 (Gene Codes
Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). Only the 10 exons of the SIAE gene were
sequenced, that is, the sequencing primers did not cover the promoter or
other regulatory regions for the gene. Data on SIAE sequences in 1351
Caucasian controls included in the multiple Exome Sequencing Project
were obtained from the Exome Variant Server, NHLBI Exome Sequencing
Project, Seattle, WA, USA (URL: http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/) (ac￾cessed November 2011).
SIAE activity assay
To assay functionality of SIAE variants, site-directed mutagenesis with Pfu
Turbo-based DNA polymerase (Stratagene, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used
to introduce selected single-nucleotide changes into full-length, C-terminal
Flag-tagged human SIAE cDNA subcloned in the pcDNA3.1. vector. These
cDNAs as well as cDNAs encoding wild-type and the catalytically inert SIAE
were transiently transfected into HEK 293T cells, the cells then lysed in 1%
NP40 in phosphate-buffered saline and the lysates as well as culture
supernatants subdivided into two equal aliquots from which the esterase
was immunoprecipitated using monoclonal anti-Flag antibody (Sigma,
St Louis, MO, USA) and protein A Sepharose. Catalytic activities were
assessed in one aliquot of the immunoprecipitated SIAE using a
fluorogenic substrate, 4-methylumbelliferyl acetate (UBS), a FluoroskanII
instrument (Finstrument) and Spectroscope software as described
previously,16 and the enzymatic activity levels then normalized to protein
levels. Relative quantity of the Flag-tagged protein was assessed in the
second aliquot as reported previously16 using a quantitative immunoblot
assay, an IR Dye 800CW-labeled goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G
secondary antibody and the LI-COR Odyssey imaging system (Lincoln, NE,
USA). The assay was performed three times for each cDNA.
Statistical analyses
Individual samples with genotype call rates of o95% and SNPs with call
rates of o95%, minor allele frequencies of o1%, or deviation from the
Hardy --Weinberg equilibrium at Po0.001. (as assessed in controls), were
removed from the analysis. In total 1450 cases, 2957 controls and 84 SNPs
were included in the statistical analyses. PLINK software (v1.07) was used to
assess allelic associations, R-script (http://www.rproject.org/) to generate
figures and haploview software, and Haploview software, version 4.1
(http://www.broad.mit.edu/mpg/haploview), to evaluate linkage disequili￾brium between pairs of SNPs. Haplotype block structure was defined
according to the criteria established by Gabriel and the pairwise estimates
of standardized Lewontin’s disequilibrium coefficient (D0
), whereas the
linkage disequilibrium among pairs of SNPs was characterized according to
the square of the correlation coefficient (r
2
). Conditional logistic regression
analyses of multiple markers were performed using SAS v9.13 (SAS
Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) with subsequent power analyses conducted
using CATs software (http://www.sph.umich.edu/csg/abecasis/CaTS/
index.html) and an additive model. w2 or Fisher’s exact testing was
performed to demonstrate association for sequence data. For allelic
association tests, the threshold for declaring significance in the fine
mapping studies was Po0.05/84 (o6  104
).
