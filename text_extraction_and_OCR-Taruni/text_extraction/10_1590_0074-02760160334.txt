Chagas cardiomyopathy is the most frequent and most severe manifestation of chronic Chagas disease, and is one 
of the leading causes of morbidity and death in Latin America. Although the pathogenesis of Chagas cardiomyopathy 
is incompletely understood, it may involve several mechanisms, including parasite-dependent myocardial damage, 
immune-mediated myocardial injury (induced by the parasite itself and by self-antigens), and microvascular and 
neurogenic disturbances. In the past three decades, a consensus has emerged that parasite persistence is crucial to 
the development and progression of Chagas cardiomyopathy. In this context, antiparasitic treatment in the chronic 
phase of Chagas disease could prevent complications related to the disease. However, according to the results of the 
BENEFIT trial, benznidazole seems to have no benefit for arresting disease progression in patients with chronic 
Chagas cardiomyopathy. In this review, we give an update on the main pathogenic mechanisms of Chagas disease, 
and re-examine and discuss the results of the BENEFIT trial, together with its limitations and implications.

Chagas heart disease has two phases, acute and 
chronic, usually separated by several decades. Most pa￾tients in the chronic phase have the indeterminate form 
of the disease for life, which is characterised by absence 
of signs and symptoms of disease, a normal 12-lead elec￾trocardiogram, and normal radiological examination of 
chest, oesophagus, and colon. Even in these patients an 
array of subtle anatomic and functional abnormalities 
has been shown with the use of more elaborate diagnos￾tic tests, demonstrating that, similar to other diseases, 
Chagas disease manifests in humans with an ample 
spectrum of severity (Mady et al. 1984, Décourt et al. 
1985). Despite the presence of such minor abnormali￾ties, whose prognostic meanings are uncertain and are 
detected only with more sophisticated methods, it is im￾portant to emphasize that as long as the patients remain 
with the indeterminate form of the disease their progno￾sis is excellent (Dias 1989, de Oliveira Jr 1990). Howev￾er, a most intriguing question regarding the pathogenesis 
of chronic Chagas disease is which genetic or acquired 
factors are decisive to determine in a specific patient 
the installation and progression of the cardiomyopathy 
(Marin-Neto et al. 2010, Rassi Jr et al. 2010).
Pathogenic alterations in acute Chagas disease - Or￾gan damage during the acute phase occurs as a result of 
intense parasitaemia and tissue parasitism, with super￾imposed immune-inflammatory response to the parasite. 
Although any organ can harbour the parasites, experi￾mental Trypanosoma cruzi infection has a typical pre￾dilection for the muscle system in the heart, oesophagus 
and colon, and for the central nervous system (Okumura 
et al. 1960, Teixeira et al. 1975, Andrade et al. 1994). An 
in vitro model using human cell lines in culture to observe 
T. cruzi passage through the vascular barrier showed that 
there is usually no disruption of the endothelial monolay￾er, as the parasite uses a special transmigration process 
that is facilitated by bradykinin and CCL2 chemokine 
(Coates et al. 2013). These interesting findings still await 
for a demonstration that such phenomenon also occurs in 
vivo. Conventional histopathology shows prominent in￾flammatory changes in the vicinity of ruptured infected 
cells in tissues from both right and left cardiac chambers 
(Laranja et al. 1956, Kumar et al. 1969). Myocarditis is 
intense and diffuse with myocyte necrosis, interstitial 
oedema, vasculitis and capillary dilation, and mononu￾clear and polymorphonuclear infiltration (Okumura et al. 
1960, Kumar et al. 1969, Teixeira et al. 1975, Andrade 
et al. 1994). The immunological reaction is thought to 
control the active parasite multiplication through various 
host innate mechanisms that play a role in detecting and 
controlling parasite tissue invasion - a powerful reaction 
involving CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells and B-cells activa￾tion that induces direct antitrypanosoma cytotoxicity, 
cytokine secretion and production of specific antibodies 
against the parasite (Tarleton et al. 1992).
The neuronal depopulation of the Meissner and Au￾erbach plexuses that occurs in oesophageal and colon 
tissues during the acute phase are a key factor in the 
pathogenesis of megaoesophagus and megacolon in the 
chronic phase (Köberle 1968, Meneghelli 1985). Direct

damage of smooth muscle may also be a contributory 
factor, but this hypothesis has not been adequately ex￾plored in humans and animal models of Chagas disease.
Pathogenesis of chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy - The 
pathogenic mechanisms responsible for cardiac lesions de￾veloping during the chronic phase of Chagas disease are not 
completely understood, but four mechanisms are believed 
to contribute: neurogenic disturbances, microvascular de￾rangements, parasite-dependent damage, and immune-me￾diated tissue injury (Marin-Neto et al. 2007).
The first two mechanisms probably play only an ancil￾lary role in the development of the cardiac lesions and clini￾cal complications observed in patients with chronic Chagas 
cardiomyopathy, and will not be discussed here (Marin￾Neto et al. 2007, 2010, 2013). By contrast, most investiga￾tors now believe that parasite persistence is a critical factor 
in causing inflammation and in initiating and progressing 
chronic myocarditis. This previously neglected concept in 
turn rescues the notion that chronic Chagas disease is in￾deed an infectious entity, in which the parasite is not com￾pletely eliminated, despite the multiple and proteiform re￾actions developed by the host systems against it.
Parasite-dependent inflammation and myocardial 
damage - Chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy is an ac￾quired cardiomyopathy characterised by sparse inflam￾matory infiltrates, minimal parasitaemia, low-grade 
tissue parasitism, and intense and extensive reparative 
and reactive fibrosis (Rossi 1991). Classical histologi￾cal techniques usually cannot detect the parasite, but 
immunohistochemical and polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR) based methods have identified T. cruzi antigens 
in inflammatory foci in biopsy and autopsy materials 
from patients with chronic Chagas disease (Higuchi et 
al. 1993, Bellotti et al. 1996). Thus, a consensus is now 
emerging that parasite persistence is directly and caus￾ally related to cell death and parasite-driven immune 
responses, which play a pivotal role in the development 
of chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (Tarleton 2003a, Ki￾erszenbaum 2007, Bonney & Engman 2008).
Additional evidence to support this concept has been 
found in other studies in animal models of T. cruzi infec￾tion and in humans with Chagas disease: (1) tissue para￾site load clearly correlates with the intensity of inflam￾mation in animal models of T. cruzi infection (Zhang 
& Tarleton 1999); (2) reinfection or continued exposure 
to infection by permanently residing in areas of active 
transmission leads to an increase of both the parasite load 
and disease severity in animal models and in infected hu￾mans (Bustamante et al. 2002, Storino et al. 2002); (3) 
trypanocidal treatment with benznidazole, nifurtimox, 
or fexinidazole does not eradicate the parasite, but the 
reduced parasite burden does attenuate the myocarditis 
in animal models (Andrade et al. 1991, Garcia et al. 2005, 
Bahia et al. 2012); (4) T. cruzi genetic material has been 
consistently detected in cardiac specimens from patients 
with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy, but not in cardiac 
specimens from seropositive patients who died without 
clinical signs of cardiac disease (Jones et al. 1992); 5) T. 
cruzi DNA was detectable by PCR methods in the periph￾eral blood of 86% of patients with well-defined chronic 
Chagas cardiomyopathy (Salomone et al. 2000).
Marked phenotype and genotype diversity occurs 
among the six classes of T. cruzi strains (Zingales et al. 
2012). This may be a cause for the remarkable differenc￾es in the pathological and clinical manifestations of Cha￾gas disease in various geographical regions – e.g., vir￾tual absence of gastrointestinal disease, or discrepancies 
in the incidence of sudden death (Zingales et al. 2014). 
T. cruzi genetic diversity may also be responsible for the 
inconsistent response to several trypanocidal agents in 
animal and clinical studies (Rassi Jr et al. 2009).
Immune-mediated tissue injury - Immune-mediated 
cardiac injury is caused by the infiltration of mononucle￾ar cells and release of damaging cytokines, which play 
a decisive role in the development of chronic Chagas 
cardiomyopathy, according to animal and clinical stud￾ies (Marin-Neto et al. 2015a). These mechanisms are 
most probably triggered by persistence of the parasite 
in the tissue, but autoimmunity mechanisms – involving 
polyclonal activation, molecular self-mimicry by para￾site antigens, or cryptic epitopes shared by the host and 
parasites – have also been reported in animal models and 
humans with Chagas disease, and are thought to contrib￾ute to or aggravate myocardial damage (Minoprio 2001, 
Cunha-Neto et al. 2006, Teixeira et al. 2011a).
However, the autoimmunity hypothesis – that poly￾clonal activation or molecular mimicry is directly in￾volved in the pathogenesis of myocardial lesions ascribed 
to T. cruzi infection – remains controversial and difficult 
to validate (Tarleton & Zhang 1999, Tarleton 2003b). 
Anti-self responses are described in T. cruzi infection, 
but there is no direct and definitive evidence that the 
immune reactions against the mimicked auto-antigens 
are actually pathogenic, as the anti-self antibodies in 
animal models and humans with chronic Chagas disease 
are heterophilic and have a poor correlation with devel￾opment of heart lesions (Tarleton 2003b). In summary, 
the role, relative contribution and clinical relevance of 
autoimmunity in triggering myocardial degeneration in 
the chronic phase of Chagas disease remains to be deter￾mined (Marin-Neto et al. 2015a).
An additional mechanism for the autoimmune re￾sponse in the absence of parasites was suggested by the 
observation that mitochondrial DNA from T. cruzi can 
be inserted into the genome of a chicken model in which 
the parasitic infection was induced at the egg stage, but 
parasite persistence was precluded (Teixeira et al. 2011b).
Immune-mediated pathology of chronic Chagas car￾diomyopathy is rather complex, probably involving sev￾eral interactive factors. This complexity is illustrated by 
the paradox observation that natural or iatrogenic im￾munosuppressive conditions usually exacerbate T. cruzi
parasitaemia and aggravate the inflammatory process 
(Rassi et al. 1997, Sartori et al. 2007). This epitomises 
the double-edged-sword type of host immune response 
to the parasite, because the inflammatory lesions found 
in the myocardium of patients and animals chronical￾ly infected with the T. cruzi are typically composed of 
macrophages and a predominance of CD8+ over CD4+ 
Th1 cells (Dutra & Gollob 2008). The pathogenic pic￾ture is further compounded by the enhanced expression 
of genes responsible for an increased release of several 

226 Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Vol. 112(3), March 2017
pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, especial￾ly INF-g and TGF-a (Ferreira et al. 2014). Also, other 
investigators have reported a reduced production of 
regulatory T-cells and their related cytokines, IL-10 and 
IL-17 (Guedes et al. 2012, Nogueira et al. 2014). These 
findings are consistent with an immunological imbal￾ance related to up-regulation of Th-1-cells, and deficient 
suppressor activity of regulatory T-cells that otherwise 
would act to control myocardial inflammation.
There is now ample evidence that the immunopathol￾ogy reactions in chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy are 
dependent on genetic polymorphisms of the host, which 
modulate the expression of immune inhibitory molecules 
and potentially alter the equilibrium between host and 
parasite (Marin-Neto et al. 2015a). Thus, alleles, geno￾types and haplotypes associated with enhanced expres￾sion of the regulatory CTLA-4 system predominate in 
patients with the indeterminate form of Chagas disease, 
probably averting the development of cardiomyopathy 
(Dias et al. 2013). By contrast, in a genetic and proteomic 
study of infected patients with chronic Chagas cardio￾myopathy, polymorphism in the alfa cardiac actin-1 gene 
(ACTC-1) was associated with an increased tendency to 
maintain a pro-inflammatory status, possibly by modu￾lating transcription factor binding to ACTC-1 promoter 
regions (Frade et al. 2013). These results and others from 
several investigators confirm previous evidence of fa￾milial aggregation of cases with chronic Chagas cardio￾myopathy, and hint that only around a third of infected 
patients develop the clinical complications of the disease 
because of a genetic component that confers susceptibil￾ity after infection (Cunha-Neto & Chevillard 2014).
Contrary to previous reports, more recent evidence 
suggested that spontaneous eradication of the parasite 
may be achieved by the effective action of the host im￾mune system in the murine model of T. cruzi infection 
(Tarleton 2013), and there have been several anecdotal 
reports of spontaneous cure of T. cruzi infection in hu￾mans (Francolino et al. 2003, Dias et al. 2008). A recent 
hypothesis was developed to explain why the immune 
system may not always be capable of sterilising these 
infected animals or the human host: instead of an inher￾ently deficient immune response, it is possible that the 
parasite could escape the cytotoxic CD8+ cells due to its 
ability to remain unnoticed within myocardial and other 
harbouring structural cells (Álvarez et al. 2014).
Finally, a pathophysiological link between impaired 
parasympathetic control, a derangement described in 
early phases of human Chagas disease, and abnormal 
neuroimmunomodulatory regulation has been recently 
suggested in a murine model of chronic T. cruzi infec￾tion (Cuba et al. 2014). These findings were based on the 
effect of pharmacological cholinergic stimulation using 
pyridostigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor, which reduced 
myocardial inflammation, fibrosis, hypertrophy, and 
serum levels of IFN-g, but did not change IL-10 levels. 
Cuba et al. (2014) thought that the autonomic dysregula￾tion caused by T. cruzi infection could abolish the normal 
neuroimmunomodulatory anti-inflammatory role that is 
normally played by the parasympathetic nervous system.
Evidence for the benefit of aetiological treatment in 
patients with chronic Chagas disease - Until the BEN￾znidazole Evaluation for Interrupting Trypanosomiasis 
(BENEFIT) trial (Marin-Neto et al. 2008, Morillo et al. 
2015), evidence to support the fact that treatment with ef￾fective trypanocidal drugs (nifurtimox or benznidazole) 
can positively affect the progression of disease in asymp￾tomatic patients with T. cruzi infection or in patients with 
preexisting cardiac disease was scanty and based mostly 
on observational studies and a few small randomised tri￾als. Table I shows the systematic reviews and meta-anal￾yses looking at this, and a systematic review of people 
with T. cruzi infection in the USA also included a critical 
appraisal of trypanocidal treatment (Bern et al. 2007).
Several obstacles have hindered gaining a better un￾derstanding, including (Andrade et al. 2011): the miscon￾ception that the main pathogenic mechanism of chronic 
Chagas disease was autoimmunity, not parasite persis￾tence; the fact that no ideal trypanocidal drug has been 
developed since nifurtimox and benznidazole were intro￾duced 40 years ago (so far these are the only clinically 
approved drugs that are proven to be active against both 
the circulating and the tissue-nested parasites); the wrong 
belief that side-effects related to these drugs were too fre￾quent and serious to be tolerated by most patients; and 
doctors’ natural reluctance to use an aetiological treat￾ment in patients with already manifest cardiomyopathy, 
because they believed it would be too late for any benefit.
Development of the protocol for the BENEFIT trial - 
Two of us (ARJ and AR) wrote the original draft protocol 
for a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to 
assess whether trypanocidal therapy with benznidazole for 
60 days reduces mortality and major cardiovascular events
in patients with established chronic Chagas cardiomyopa￾thy (Marin-Neto et al. 2008). We suggested the research 
should be multicentre and international, and mean follow￾up should last for 5 years. This proposed trial followed a 
visit to Brazil in 2002 by Dr Salim Yusuf from the Popula￾tion Health Research Institute, Hamilton Health Sciences 
and McMaster University (Hamilton, ON, Canada), who 
was keen to sponsor a collaborative research programme.
Table II sets out some features of the original proto￾col and shows that the final protocol changed in several 
key ways following input from the BENEFIT steering 
committee.
We recommended excluding patients with advanced 
heart disease or who already manifested a clinical condi￾tion that was a component of the composite primary end￾point of the study, but the final protocol opted to substan￾tially broaden the eligibility criteria. We also disagreed 
with the decision to include older patients (up to 75 years), 
and patients who were susceptible to reinfection.
We derived a projected event rate of 30% in the pla￾cebo group from the results of the doctoral thesis of one 
of us (Rassi Jr 2003). In this longitudinal study of 424 
Brazilian patients with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy 
in the 1980s, the combined event rate was 34% after 5 
years of follow up. The mean age of the cohort was 47 
years (SD 11.0); patients older than 70 years were ex￾cluded and only five patients were aged 65-70 years.

Chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy: a review of the pathogenesis and the efficacy of aetiological treatment • Anis Rassi Jr et al. 229
We considered a 20% relative risk reduction – from 
an event rate of 30% in the placebo group to 24% in the 
benznidazole group – as the minimal clinically impor￾tant reduction in effect size, worthy to justify a change in 
the patient’s management. It represents an absolute risk 
reduction of 6%, which translates into a number needed 
to treat of 17; that is, we would have to treat 17 patients 
with benznidazole for 60 days to prevent one major car￾diovascular event, after 5 years of follow-up. We also 
chose a 20% relative risk reduction because it was con￾sidered feasible (although not easy) to achieve. 10-20% 
of patients cannot tolerate taking benznidazole, efficacy 
of benznidazole in eradicating T. cruzi is limited in the 
patients we had deemed eligible (less than 50%, at best), 
and, even if benznidazole eliminates the parasite, the 
mechanism of disease progression may not be exclusive￾ly parasite-related. Thus, proper selection of patients for 
whom trypanocidal therapy has at least some plausibility 
to work is of paramount importance in a trial of a drug 
and a disease with such peculiarities. Although extend￾ing the eligibility criteria helps with recruiting patients 
and generalising the results, the inclusion of patients 
who are not likely to respond to benznidazole could di￾lute identifying an eventual beneficial effect.
Very importantly, we recommended that the study 
should focus on the assessment of hard clinical end￾points, not parasite-related outcomes, such as clearance 
of parasitaemia or disappearance of antibodies (nega￾tive seroconversion). The results of conventional sero￾logical assays remain positive for years or even decades 
after successful therapy (Rassi & Luquetti 2005), and 
the negative results of PCR assays after treatment are 
not reliable markers of cure (Britto et al. 2001, de Lana 
& Martins-Filho 2015). A negative PCR result does not 
necessarily rule out infection; it indicates only the ab￾sence of circulating T. cruzi DNA in the blood sample 
being drawn for testing. Therefore, these tests are nei￾ther useful nor practical to assess the outcome of anti￾trypanosomal therapy in patients with chronic Chagas 
cardiomyopathy, and we disagreed with the BENEFIT 
steering committee’s decision to further assess the effect 
of benznidazole on parasite clearance using PCR and 
whether this translates to improved clinical outcomes. 
Instead, in the original protocol, a pilot study involving 
PCR investigation, designed exclusively to test if aetio￾logical treatment significantly reduces parasite burden 
in the first 600 patients recruited to the main trial was 
proposed (Marin-Neto et al. 2008).
Principal results of the BENEFIT trial - BENEFIT 
is the largest randomised trial on Chagas disease (Mo￾rillo et al. 2015) and the investigators are commended 
for achieving such a large trial in a disease where re￾cruitment of patients is notoriously difficult. It involved 
2854 patients with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy at 49 
centres in five Latin American countries: 1358 patients 
in Brazil, 559 in Argentina, 502 in Colombia, 357 in Bo￾livia, and 78 in El Salvador. Patients were assigned to 
receive benznidazole or placebo (5 mg per kg of body￾weight per day) for 40-80 days, and followed up for a 
mean of 5.4 years (Morillo et al. 2015).
Benznidazole had no significant effect on the primary 
endpoint that was the first event of any of the components 
of the composite outcome of death, resuscitated cardiac 
arrest, sustained ventricular tachycardia, insertion of a 
pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, car￾diac transplantation, new heart failure, stroke, or other 
thromboembolic event. 27.5% of patients in the benznida￾zole group versus 29.1% in the placebo group reached the 
primary endpoint, corresponding to a hazard ratio (HR) 
of 0.93 (95% CI 0.81-1.07; p = 0.31) (Morillo et al. 2015).
PCR was used to detect blood parasites in 1896 patients 
at baseline, in 1618 patients at the end of treatment, in 1530 
patients at two years, and in 1487 patients at the final fol￾low-up visit (Morillo et al. 2015). PCR had low sensitivity 
to blood parasite DNA – it was detected in around 60% of 
patients at baseline (59.5% of patients in the benznidazole 
group vs 61.7% in the placebo group tested positive). Ad￾ditionally, the test was not done in the same patients at each 
scheduled follow-up visit after treatment (number of pa￾tients who had all tests done was not informed).
For patients who tested positive for blood parasites at 
baseline, treatment converted the PCR result to negative 
in 66.2% of patients in the benznidazole group versus 
33.5% in the placebo group by the end of the treatment 
period, in 55.4% versus 35.3% at two years of follow-up, 
and in 46.7% versus 33.1% at five years or more of follow￾up (p < 0.001 for all comparisons) (Morillo et al. 2015).
The proportion of patients whose PCR result converted 
to negative varied between countries. For example, at the 
end of treatment, PCR conversion was highest in Brazil, 
with 86.3% of patients in the benznidazole group versus 
24.3% in the placebo group [odds ratio (OR) 7.20, 95% CI 
4.53-11.4], and it was lowest in Colombia and El Salvador, 
with 45.6% in the benznidazole group versus 43.9% in the 
placebo group (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.81-1.62). In Argentina 
and Bolivia, 73.0% of patients in the benznidazole group 
versus 28.6% in the placebo group converted to negative 
(OR 3.32, 95% CI, 2.43-4.54) (Morillo et al. 2015).
Although 23.9% of patients in the benznidazole group 
had transiently interrupted treatment because of adverse 
events (vs 9.5% for placebo, p < 0.001), only 13.4% dis￾continued treatment permanently (vs 3.6% for placebo, 
p < 0.001), which is lower than previously reported with 
benznidazole. Notably, only 14 patients (0.5%) were lost 
to follow-up by the end of the study (Morillo et al. 2015).
Limitations of the findings - Several features of the 
BENEFIT trial raise some concerns and merit further 
discussion before concluding that benznidazole has no 
role in the treatment of patients with established chronic 
Chagas cardiomyopathy. We exhaustively addressed all 
these concerns during the meetings of the BENEFIT 
steering committee.
Despite the neutral overall result, all components of 
the primary endpoint were, albeit not attaining statisti￾cal significance, less frequent in the benznidazole group 
than in the placebo group (Table III). Table III also shows 
that patients receiving benznidazole had significantly 
fewer admissions to hospital for cardiovascular causes 
than those receiving placebo. It is possible that the re￾sults of BENEFIT could become positive if admission 

230 Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Vol. 112(3), March 2017
to hospital was included in the composite endpoint, as 
we suggested in the original protocol (Table II). Keeping 
patients out of hospital is a major goal in the treatment of 
patients with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy and, even 
as a post-hoc analysis, this finding may be informative.
Although composite outcomes are frequently adopt￾ed as the primary endpoint in clinical trials, analysing 
time to first event is suboptimum for a chronic illness 
characterised by a relatively long period before death, 
during which multiple non-fatal events may occur, often 
leading to hospital admission (Rogers et al. 2014). For 
a trial of chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy, an analysis 
using statistical methods that take into account recur￾rent events could show a larger treatment benefit than 
the conventional analysis of time to first event, and is 
worthy of further investigation.
Most investigators of the BENEFIT trial believed that 
the baseline characteristics of the two study groups were 
well balanced at the time of randomisation. However, five 
of six factors that are clearly recognised as strong predictors 
of a poor outcome (Rassi Jr et al. 2006) were more common 
in the benznidazole group (Table IV). Unfortunately, no ad￾justment for these specific variables was reported.
Was BENEFIT an underpowered clinical trial? - The 
BENEFIT investigators estimated that 3000 patients (1500 
in each group) were needed to detect a 26% reduction in 
the relative risk of the primary endpoint with benznidazole 
compared with placebo, or vice versa, with 90% power 
(Table II). However, the event rate in the placebo group was 
lower than expected (5.4% instead of 8% per year), so the 
BENEFIT trial was underpowered to detect significant dif￾ferences in cardiovascular events between the two groups.
Table V shows that even if the event rate in the pla￾cebo group had been 6% per year (as predicted in the 
original protocol estimate), the relative risk would have 
had to reduce by at least 28.8%, according to the final 
BENEFIT protocol calculations, to maintain a power of 
90% with the same sample size and get a p value of less 
than 0.05. We speculate that such a large reduction in the 
relative risk of events is highly unlikely to occur when 
patients with established chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy 
are treated with benznidazole, and planning for a modest 
improvement in outcomes would probably be a more re￾alistic strategy. Reductions of 15-25% in relative risk and 
5% in absolute risk are sufficiently worthwhile to change 
clinical practice in this population, and align with the esti￾mates we made in the original protocol (Table II).
Efficacy of benznidazole between geographical re￾gions - Response to treatment did not differ significantly 
between geographical regions, according to a post-hoc 
subgroup analysis of the BENEFIT trial (Table VI). This 
conclusion was based on a statistical test of interaction, 
which assessed whether the variation in hazard ratios 
across regions could plausibly have arisen by chance.
However, subgroup analysis by geographical region 
is particularly challenging because countries can be 
grouped in many different ways, each yielding a differ￾ent strength of evidence for geographical heterogeneity 
(Pocock et al. 2013). Additionally, the overall benefit of 
a new treatment may not apply equally to all eligible pa￾tients; this is particularly true in Chagas disease because 
genetic subtypes of T. cruzi vary across geographical 
regions, and diversity in parasite genotyping may affect 
response to benznidazole (Filardi & Brener 1987, Neal 
& van Bueren 1988, Yun et al. 2009).
In the BENEFIT trial, no genotype analyses were 
done. The grouping of geographical regions was not pre￾defined before the study started, and followed the as￾TABLE III

sumption that the strain of T. cruzi varies between coun￾tries, based on available studies (Zingales et al. 2012, 
2014): Colombia and El Salvador (where strain TcI is 
most prevalent), Brazil (where strain TcII is most preva￾lent), and Argentina and Bolivia (where strains TcV and 
TcVI are most prevalent). If all five countries are instead 
compared separately, the statistical test of interaction 
yields a p value of 0.06 (unpublished observation). Ad￾ditionally, when the hazard ratio for Brazil (the only 
country where TcII is supposed to be most prevalent) is 
compared with all other countries combined, the p value 
for interaction is 0.03 (unpublished observation), indi￾cating that the efficacy of benznidazole in Brazil was 
significantly different from the rest.
These findings show that such post-hoc analyses of 
geographical variations can be twisted to present either 
a more positive or a more negative impression of het￾erogeneity, depending on the comparisons made. As no 
grouping of countries is completely satisfactory, and 
subgroup analyses are generally seen as exploratory, a 
not unanimous decision by the BENEFIT steering com￾mittee was to show only the nonsignificant view of het￾erogeneity (p = 0.16) (Morillo et al. 2015).
Additionally, the results of the BENEFIT trial in Bra￾zil should be analysed more judiciously (Table VI, Figure). 
Benznidazole reduced the relative risk of the primary end￾point by 15% (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.71-1.02; p = 0.06) and the 
absolute by 4.4% compared with placebo. This reduction 
showed a strong trend toward statistical significance, and, 
had it reached significance, the number needed to treat to 
prevent the occurrence of one primary endpoint would be 
22. We believe that this is a good result for an inexpensive 
drug that is given for a relatively short period of time (60 
days) to patients with a chronic and often disabling dis￾ease, and has side-effects that are quite tolerable.
Geographical variations in clinical outcomes in the 
BENEFIT trial - Despite protocol-mandated uniform in￾clusion and exclusion criteria, some variation in the demo￾graphic characteristics of patient population and outcomes 
is usually expected in international randomised trials. 
However, in the BENEFIT trial, the difference in the pro￾portion of patients in the placebo group who reached the 
primary endpoint was unusually large between geograph￾ical regions. The event rate (overall and per year) was low￾er than expected in patients from Argentina and Bolivia, 
i.e. it was approximately half the rate of those from Brazil

(Table VI). Possible reasons for this difference are: patient 
selection; racial or genetic issues; regional disease char￾acteristics; differences in background therapy, healthcare 
systems, and patterns of follow-up; and data quality is￾sues, including protocol deviations.
The large subgroup of patients from Argentina and 
Bolivia (a third of the overall population), with event rates 
lower than anticipated, most likely diluted the effect size 
in the trial. Although large-scale international trials are 
preferable to those in one country, increasing recruitment 
by including other geographical regions may have ob￾scured important treatment differences in the BENEFIT 
trial. Table VI suggests that if the study had been done in 
Brazil only, the results would probably have been positive.
Conclusions and implications - The hypothesis that 
trypanocidal treatment could benefit patients with es￾tablished chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy was not con￾firmed by the results of the BENEFIT trial. Although 
the BENEFIT trial had been conceived originally as a 
pragmatic study, focusing on hard clinical endpoints, an 
unjustified emphasis on the results related to PCR-based 
detection of parasites in the blood led to the erroneous 
causal inference that despite enhancing circulating para￾site clearance, the treatment with benznidazole did not 
result in clinical benefit for the patients with established 
chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (Morillo et al. 2015). 
We caution against this biased interpretation, because of 
the erratic behavior of the PCR-based detection of the 
circulating parasite materials, and also because we do 
not have any information concerning parasite persis￾tence in the myocardial tissue after treatment. Therefore, 
the BENEFIT trial results should not be understood as 
meaning that the main theory of Chagas cardiomyopathy 
pathogenesis (based on the parasite persistence), ought 
to be abolished. In fact, it is necessary to devise more ef￾fective treatment regimens and more effective methods 
to assess parasite clearance after aetiological therapy, if 
the hypothesis is to be tested again.
In the absence of more definitive data and with no 
other outcome trial planned for the near future, mainly 
due to the lack of interest from the pharmaceutical in￾dustry, doctors and patients with chronic Chagas car￾diomyopathy must use the best available information to 
guide their treatment decision.
The overall neutral findings of the BENEFIT trial 
failing to show a significant reduction in the primary 
endpoint of morbidity and mortality in patients with 
chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy with the post-hoc ob￾servation that fewer patients receiving benznidazole are 
admitted to hospital for cardiovascular causes (Morillo 
et al. 2015) is probably the most reliable result of the 
trial. The regional differences in responses to benzni￾dazole, with a signal of benefit in patients randomised 
from Brazil, may highly confound the interpretation of 
the results. Until more comprehensive data are available 
to better understand the differences in clinical outcomes 
between countries, the demographic characteristics of 
the patient population and their response to benznida￾zole, we expect a mixed response from the medical com￾munity. Some doctors will be reluctant to use benznida-

zole for patients with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy, 
while others (including us) will continue to prescribe it, 
especially for most of our Brazilian patients.
We strongly believe that the risk of incurring an a er￾ror (not to apply a promising therapeutic intervention with 
tolerable side-effects) is much less acceptable than incur￾ring a b error (not to adopt something that might prove 
futile in the future) (Marin-Neto et al. 2015b). On the ba￾sis of current evidence, doctors’ failure to even consider 
the possibility of aetiological treatment for their patients 
is questionable from an ethical standpoint (Tarleton et al. 
2007, 2014, Viotti et al. 2014) – after all, “absence of evi￾dence is not evidence of absence” (Altman & Bland 1995).
