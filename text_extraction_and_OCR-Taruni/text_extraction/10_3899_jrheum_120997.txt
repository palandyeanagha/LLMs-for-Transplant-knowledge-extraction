ABSTRACT. Objective. To examine the predictive significance of 2 pneumoproteins, surfactant protein D (SP-D)
and CC-chemokine ligand 18 (CCL18), for the course of systemic sclerosis (SSc)-related interstitial
lung disease. 
Methods. The pneumoproteins were determined in the baseline plasma samples of 266 patients with
early SSc enrolled in the GENISOS observational cohort. They also were measured in 83 followup
patient samples. Pulmonary function tests were obtained annually. The primary outcome was decline
in forced vital capacity (FVC percentage predicted) over time. The predictive significance for
longterm change in FVC was investigated by a joint analysis of longitudinal measurements (sequen￾tially obtained FVC percentage predicted) and survival data.
Results. SP-D and CCL18 levels were both higher in patients with SSc than in matched controls 
(p < 0.001 and p = 0.015, respectively). Baseline SP-D levels correlated with lower concomitantly
obtained FVC (r = –0.27, p < 0.001), but did not predict the short-term decline in FVC at 1 year
followup visit or its longterm decline rate. CCL18 showed a significant correlation with steeper
short-term decline in FVC (p = 0.049), but was not a predictor of its longterm decline rate. Similarly,
a composite score of SP-D and CCL18 was a significant predictor of short-term decline in FVC but
did not predict its longterm decline rate. Further, the longitudinal change in these 2 pneumoproteins
did not correlate with the concomitant percentage change in FVC. 
Conclusion. SP-D correlated with concomitantly obtained FVC, while CCL18 was a predictor of
short-term decline in FVC. However, neither SP-D nor CCL18 was a longterm predictor of FVC
course in patients with early SSc. (First Release April 15 2013; J Rheumatol 2013;40:1114–20;

Systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma) is associated with
considerable morbidity and mortality. The overall pooled
standardized mortality ratio of patients with SSc is 3.51,
which is considerably higher than mortality ratios observed
in other rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and
Sjögren syndrome2. Pulmonary involvement is the leading
cause of SSc-related death, with interstitial lung disease
(ILD) being the most common cause3,4. However, the
course of SSc-ILD is highly variable, ranging from a mild
and stable involvement to a severe and rapidly progressive
course5,6. Therefore, clinical and serological markers
capable of predicting the course of SSc-ILD are crucial for
more focused and effective monitoring and treatment of
patients with SSc.
Pulmonary function tests (PFT) have long been used in
patients with SSc to monitor lung function, but only forced
vital capacity (FVC) has been validated as an outcome
measure for the severity of SSc-ILD in randomized control
trials7.
To date, there are few known predictors of pulmonary

disease in patients with SSc. Presence of antitopoisomerase
I antibody (ATA) was predictive of the rate of decline in
FVC over time5. Additionally, fibrosis scores on
high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) are
predictive of the decline in FVC8. However, both ATA and
fibrosis scores are short-term predictors of decline in FVC.
There are currently no clinically used longterm predictors of
ILD course in patients with SSc. Finding additional
biomarkers that can predict future lung disease is funda￾mental in identifying high-risk patients before irreversible
fibrotic damage occurs. Pneumoprotein levels in blood are
attractive candidates for ILD biomarkers because they are
easily obtainable and lung-specific. Surfactant protein D
(SP-D) and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 18 (CCL18) are
important pneumoproteins that are currently being investi￾gated for use as biomarkers for SSc-related ILD. 
SP-D is formed by type II alveolar cells in lung tissue and
contributes to maintenance of pulmonary mechanics. Newer
studies have found that surfactant also functions in
pulmonary host defense and is part of the innate immunity.
SP-D is able to coat bacteria and viruses and promotes
phagocytosis by macrophages. Additionally, SP-D inhibits T
cell proliferation9. Previous work with this pneumoprotein
by several groups10,11,12,13 revealed high levels of SP-D in
patients with SSc, and SP-D was higher in patients with ILD
than in those without. Predictive qualities remain to be
defined.
CCL18 [also known as pulmonary activation-regulated
chemokine (PARC)] is mainly produced by alveolar
macrophages (M2 phenotype). It is chemotactic for
activated T cells and nonactivated lymphocytes. CCL18 also
plays a role in the primary immune response by assisting in
the trafficking of naive lymphocytes and immature dendritic
cells14. In a study of 123 patients with SSc, CCL18 was
associated with decreased vital capacity15. In another study,
serum CCL18 correlated with its concentration in the
bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, as well as BAL
eosinophil and neutrophil cell counts in patients with
pulmonary fibrosis (including 12 patients with SSc). The
change in the serum CCL18 levels over time correlated also
with change in total lung capacity in this study16. In a sub￾sequent study involving 83 patients with SSc, baseline
CCL18 levels were predictive of time to occurrence of
combined deleterious events of 10% decrease in lung
capacity or FVC, or death17.
Our goal was to determine the predictive significance of
either pneumoprotein, SP-D or CCL18, for the course of
ILD (decline in percentage predicted FVC over time) in
patients with SSc. Specifically, we examined whether SP-D
or CCL18 correlated with percentage predicted FVC at the
cross-sectional level. Subsequently, we investigated
prospectively whether these pneumoproteins are predictive
of either short-term or longterm change in percentage
predicted FVC. We also examined whether percentage
changes in these pneumoproteins over time correlate with
change in lung function.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The Genetics versus Environment in Scleroderma Outcome Study
(GENISOS) is a prospective, observational cohort of patients with early
SSc. The main goal of GENISOS is to identify clinical and molecular
markers for various disease outcomes in patients with SSc. This
prospective cohort study is a joint effort among 3 academic institutions in
Texas, USA: the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, the
University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, and the University of
Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. The study started in 1998, and
recruitment and followup study visits are continuing. All patients enrolled
in the GENISOS cohort at the time of analysis were included in this study.
Patient selection. Patients who fulfilled the following inclusion criteria
were enrolled: diagnosis of SSc according to the American College of
Rheumatology preliminary classification criteria or at least 3 of the 5
features of CREST (calcinosis, Raynaud phenomenon, esophageal dys￾motility, sclerodactyly, telangiectasia, with sclerodactyly being manda￾tory). Further, all patients were within 5 years of disease onset calculated
from the first non-Raynaud phenomenon (RP) symptom. The study was
approved by the institutional review board of all participating sites, and
written informed consent was obtained from all study subjects. Further
details about this cohort including the course of ILD have been published5. 
Data plasma collection. SP-D and CCL18 (PARC) levels were determined
in the baseline samples of 266 patients with SSc and 97 unaffected controls
matched for age, ethnicity, and sex. In addition to the 266 samples collected
at the study entry (baseline), we also examined 83 followup samples
collected on an average followup time of 3.76 years after enrollment.
Plasma was collected in EDTA blood collection tubes, centrifuged,
aliquoted, and stored at –80°C. The plasma samples had undergone only 2
freeze/thaw cycles before protein measurements. All samples were
measured in duplicates. The pneumoproteins were measured using human
SP-D and CCL18 ELISA kits according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Cell Sciences). Coefficient of variation < 15% between the duplicate
samples was considered acceptable. The upper limit of normal value based
on the 95th percentile in controls was 2812 ng/ml for SP-D and 214 ng/ml
for CCL18. 
A normalized composite score of SP-D and CCL18 was also calculated.
For each pneumoprotein, concentrations above the 95th percentile value in
the dataset were assigned a value of 1.0. The remaining concentration
values were then scaled to the 95th percentile value, and these normalized
values of SP-D and CCL18 were summed to derive the final composite
score for each subject (possible range 0–2).
Pulmonary function test. PFT tests were performed at the initial visit, and
annually thereafter. FVC, expressed as the percentage predicted FVC, was
used as the outcome measure for the severity of SSc-related ILD. Predicted
FVC values were calculated according to the patient’s age, height, weight,
sex, and ethnicity using consistent reference values. Similarly, predicted
DLCO adjusted for the current hemoglobin levels were calculated. All PFT
data were reviewed by a pulmonologist (RMEYM) and data that did not
fulfill the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society
criteria for pulmonary function testing were excluded.
Statistical analysis. The pneumoprotein levels were log-transformed for all
analyses because of the non-normal distribution of data in both control and
SSc populations. First, the protein levels between patients and controls
were compared by t test. In all subsequent analyses, FVC, expressed as
percentage predicted values, was used. The correlation of protein levels at
the baseline visit with concomitantly obtained FVC was investigated by
linear regression.
Next, we investigated the predictive significance of baseline pneumo￾proteins for short-term change in FVC by linear regression. The short-term
change in FVC was calculated based on percentage change in FVC between

the baseline and 1-year followup visit [(FVC baseline – FVC 1 year)/FVC
baseline].
A joint analysis of longitudinal measurements (sequentially obtained
FVC) and survival data was also conducted to investigate the predictive
significance of the 2 pneumoproteins for the change over time in the FVC
value. This analysis allows inclusion of all FVC measurements and reflects
the slope of decline in FVC better than other approaches such as annualized
rate of decline and time to respiratory failure. Further, it accounts for the
association between FVC and survival, and it reduces the bias resulting
from the fact that patients with more rapid decline in FVC are more likely
to die5. The longitudinal component consisted of a linear model with
random effects. We accounted for baseline differences in FVC (random
intercept). Predictors in the linear model included SP-D and CCL18
(separate models for each pneumoprotein) and followup time. The
predictive value of SP-D and CCL18 on the decline rate in FVC was inves￾tigated by the interaction term between the protein levels and followup time
in the longitudinal component18,19. Secondary models also included age,
ethnicity, sex, and body mass index (BMI) as predictors in the linear model.
The survival component fit a parametric Weibull model with SP-D and
CCL18 as predictors.
Finally, the correlation between the longitudinal percentage change in
pneumoproteins with the concomitant percentage change in FVC was
investigated by linear regression. These analyses were performed only in
the subgroup of patients with an available followup pneumoprotein mea￾surement (n = 83), while the cross-sectional analyses and the analysis for
predictive significance of pneumoproteins were performed in the entire
cohort.
RESULTS 
Between January 1998 and November 2009, 266 patients
were enrolled in the GENISOS cohort. The average disease
duration at time of enrollment was 2.5 years, based on the
first non-RP symptom, while disease duration was 4.5 years
based on the first symptom attributable to SSc; 156 patients
(59%) had diffuse cutaneous involvement. The mean
time-in-study was 4.4 years; 86 patients (32.3%) had died at
the time of analysis. A total of 1016 FVC measurements
from 248 patients fulfilled the American Thoracic Society/
European Respiratory Society criteria and were included in
the analysis. Further, 191 patients had at least 2 FVC mea￾surements that fulfilled these criteria. Only 8.3% of patients
were treated with cyclophosphamide during the followup
period. The demographic and baseline clinical charac￾teristics of patients and matched unaffected controls are
shown in Table 1.
Comparison of pneumoprotein levels in patients and
controls. As shown in Table 2, SP-D levels were signifi￾cantly higher in patients than in matched controls (p <
0.001, log mean difference = 0.6, 95% CI 0.4–0.81). CCL18
levels also were higher in patients than in controls (p =
0.0146, log mean difference = 0.126, 95% CI 0.025–0.23).
Cross-sectional correlation of baseline pneumoprotein
levels with FVC. As shown in Table 3 and Figure 1, there
was a significant correlation between higher SP-D levels
and lower concomitantly obtained FVC measurements at the
baseline visit (r = –0.27, p < 0.001) in the GENISOS cohort.
There was no significant correlation between plasma
CCL18 concentrations and concomitantly obtained baseline
FVC levels (r = –0.1, p = 0.175). The composite SP-D and
CCL18 score correlated with lower concomitantly obtained
FVC (r = –0.25, p = 0.001) but this relationship was not
stronger than the observed correlation of FVC with SP-D
alone. In the multivariable analysis, SP-D remained an
independent correlate of concomitant FVC (p < 0.001) after
adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, and BMI. CCL18 did not
correlate with concomitant FVC in the multivariable model
(p = 0.283) after correction for the same potential
confounding factors. The association of the composite SP-D
and CCL18 score with the concomitantly obtained FVC was
also independent of the above potential confounding factors
(p = 0.001).
Neither SP-D nor CCL18 correlated with the concomi￾tantly obtained modified Rodnan Skin Score (r = 0.06, p =
0.351 and r = 0.09, p = 0.238, respectively). SP-D correlated
negatively with the concomitantly obtained DLCO (r =
–0.15, p = 0.032), although this relationship was weaker
than the correlation seen with FVC. CCL18 did not correlate
significantly with the concomitantly obtained DLCO (r =
–0.14, p = 0.059).
Predictive significance of baseline pneumoprotein levels for
short-term change in FVC. Baseline SP-D showed no
predictive significance for short-term change in FVC in the
univariable analysis (r = 0.05, p = 0.591) and multivariable
analysis after adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, and BMI 
(p = 0.437; Table 4).

Baseline CCL18 levels showed a trend for predicting
short-term decline in FVC (r = 0.17, p = 0.071) in the uni￾variable analysis, which became significant after adjustment
for age, sex, ethnicity, and BMI (p = 0.049) with higher
baseline pneumoprotein levels predicting higher decline in
FVC on the 1-year followup visit (Table 4).
The composite SP-D and CCL18 score also showed a
trend for predicting short-term decline in FVC (r = 0.17, p =
0.071) in the univariable analysis, which became significant
after adjustment for potential confounders (p = 0.04).
Neither SP-D nor CCL18 was predictive of short-term
decline in FVC when only patients were subgrouped based
on the disease type (limited/diffuse) or ATA positivity (data
not shown). Neither SP-D nor CCL18 predicted short-term
change in percentage predicted DLCO (r = 0.04, p = 0.7 and
r = –0.03, p = 0.784, respectively).

Predictive significance of baseline pneumoprotein levels for
longterm change in FVC. Using a joint analysis of longitu￾dinal measurements (sequentially obtained FVC) and
survival data, we investigated the predictive significance of
baseline pneumoproteins for longterm change in FVC
accounting for mortality. As shown in Table 5, baseline
SP-D was not predictive of longterm change in FVC (p =
0.937). Similarly, baseline CCL18 did not predict longterm
change in FVC (p = 0.796; Table 5). These results did not
change substantially after adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity,
and BMI (p = 0.783 for SP-D and p = 0.753 for CCL18).
Inclusion of treatment status as an independent variable did
not show significant associations. Further, a subgroup
analysis based on disease type (limited/diffuse) or ATA
positivity did not yield significant results for longterm
predictive value of SP-D or CCL18 (data not shown). The
composite score of the SP-D and CCL18 also did not predict
longterm course of FVC (Table 5). Neither SP-D nor CCL18
predicted longterm change in percentage predicted DLCO
(p = 0.947 and p = 0.384, respectively).
Correlation of longitudinal change in pneumoprotein levels.
Finally, we investigated whether a percentage change in
plasma pneumoprotein levels correlated with percentage
change in FVC measurements. Repeat SP-D and CCL18
measurements were available in 83 patients on followup
visits. The percentage change in SP-D and CCL18 did not
correlate with concomitant percentage change in FVC (p =
0.388 and p = 0.666, respectively).
Effect of immunosuppression at baseline on the utility of
SP-D and CCL18 as biomarkers. For this analysis, we
excluded all patients treated with immunosuppressive
agents at the baseline visit (except for patients treated with
hydroxychloroquine or prednisone ≤ 5 mg per day). As
shown in Appendices 1, 2, and 3, the results of these
subgroup analyses (n = 184) were similar to those in the
overall group. Baseline SP-D also correlated significantly
with baseline FVC levels. Further, CCL18 showed a trend
for correlation with the concomitantly obtained FVC (r =
–0.17, p = 0.07). Similar to the overall cohort, the composite
SP-D and CCL18 scores were predictive of short-term
decline in FVC (r = 0.26, p = 0.019). However, neither of the
2 pneumoproteins nor the composite score predicted
longterm decline in FVC.
DISCUSSION
In our study, we investigated the predictive significance of 2
pneumoproteins, SP-D and CCL18, for course of ILD in a
large, well-characterized cohort of patients with early SSc,
using advanced statistical modeling that allowed inclusion
of all data points and accounted for dependence between the
longitudinal FVC and survival. SP-D levels correlated with
concomitantly obtained FVC and CCL18 correlated with
short-term decline in FVC, but neither SP-D nor CCL18 was
a longterm predictor of the course of ILD. 
Pneumoproteins are more attractive for biomarker
development in ILD than general markers of fibrosis,
because they reflect the pathological processes specific to
the pulmonary tissue. This is especially important in SSc
because the skin fibrosis peaks early during the course of
disease and improves afterward20, while the fibrosis in the
pulmonary tissue continues to progress even in later stages
of disease5. Therefore, general markers of fibrosis are not
well suited to discerning the improving fibrosis in the skin
tissue from progressive lung involvement. Despite this

theoretical advantage, our data do not support that SP-D and
CCL18 are reliable predictors for longterm course of ILD.
In previous studies of SP-D, there was a significant
correlation between pneumoprotein levels and concomitant
pulmonary volumes. Asano, et al found that serum levels of
SP-D were significantly higher in patients with SSc than in
healthy controls. SP-D levels also were significantly
elevated in those patients with ILD versus those without11.
Hant, et al reported that serum levels of SP-D were higher
in patients with alveolitis than in those without this
condition10. In this case, alveolitis was defined by either
BAL fluid analysis or thoracic HRCT. SP-D also was
positively correlated with concomitantly obtained
maximum fibrosis scores on HRCT. This finding was
confirmed by a subsequent independent study13. In agree￾ment with previous studies, SP-D levels were higher in
patients than controls in our study. Further, there was a
significant but weak correlation (r = –0.27) between
baseline SP-D measurements and lower concomitant FVC
measurements. However, we found no correlation between
SP-D levels and short-term or longterm change in lung
function, as measured by decline in FVC.
Kodera, et al have reported that CCL18 was higher in
patients with SSc than in controls and that its levels corre￾lated inversely with vital capacity15. Tiev, et al reported in a
prospective study of 83 patients with SSc that baseline
CCL18 levels were predictive of time to occurrence of
combined deleterious events of 10% decrease in total lung
capacity, FVC, or death. The patients were followed longi￾tudinally over a 4-year observation period in that study17.
Both studies examined patients with relatively longstanding
disease (mean disease duration 6.9 and 11.6 years, respec￾tively). We also observed higher CCL18 levels in patients
than in controls. However, there was no significant corre￾lation between CCL18 levels and concomitantly obtained
FVC, although there was a trend for this correlation after
patients treated with immunosuppressive agents were
excluded (Appendix 1). There was also a significant
although weak correlation between baseline CCL18 levels
and short-term change in FVC (r = 0.17), but this pneumo￾protein was not a predictor of longterm decline in FVC.
These findings indicate that CCL18 has some value for
short-term prediction of course of ILD but cannot be used as
a reliable longterm predictor. Some of the discrepancies
between our findings and previous studies might have
occurred because we examined patients with early disease;
this approach is less prone to problems arising from survival
bias. Further, the outcome measure investigated in our study
was the longitudinal course of FVC, the only validated
outcome measure in randomized controlled studies of
SSc-ILD7,21. This outcome measure is different from time to
development of 10% decline in total lung capacity or FVC,
as used in the previous study17.
We also conducted subgroup analyses after exclusion of
patients who were treated with immunosuppressive agents
to avoid the potential confounding effect of immunosup￾pression. In these analyses, there was no substantial dif￾ference in predictive quality of SP-D or CCL18. Further, the
combination of SP-D and CCL18 into a composite score did
not result in substantially improved predictive quality.
The strengths of our study are the well-characterized and
multiethnic cohort of patients and the large sample size.
Additionally, all PFT measurements were obtained prospec￾tively and reviewed according to uniform standards. Further,
we used sophisticated methods that allowed joint analysis of
longitudinal outcome and survival status. This joint model
accounts for the dependence of serial FVC and survival
while modeling the trajectory of FVC as a function of
followup time.
Our study has some limitations. Our cohort contains a
relatively high proportion of patients with diffuse disease,
partly because it was based in 3 tertiary care centers.
Further, the GENISOS cohort is an observation cohort that
is well-suited for biomarkers that predict the natural course
of disease, but we cannot exclude that these 2 pneumopro￾teins might be beneficial as predictors of response to
treatment in randomized controlled trials of SSc-ILD.
Plasma SP-D and CCL18 levels are elevated in patients
with SSc. SP-D correlates with the concomitantly obtained
FVC and CCL18 has some value for predicting short-term
decline in FVC. Neither SP-D nor CCL18 predicts the
longterm course of ILD in patients with SSc.
