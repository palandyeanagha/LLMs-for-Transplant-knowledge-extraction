Abstract
A 65-year-old man was referred to our hospital due to an acute onset of dyspnea and persistent fever.
Echocardiography revealed an ejection fraction (EF) of 25% with diffuse severe left ventricular (LV) dys￾function. 18F-fluorodeoxy glucose-positron emission tomography imaging showed significantly increased up￾take by the LV and right ventricular walls, indicating active inflammation. The histologic findings of the en￾domyocardial biopsy specimens indicated the presence of epithelioid cell granuloma. The final diagnosis was
thus cardiac sarcoidosis with acute inflammation. Five-months after the initiation of steroid therapy, echocar￾diography showed an EF of 50%. This is a rare case in which acute inflammation led to acute heart failure
mimicking acute myocarditis.

Introduction
Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease of unde￾fined cause involving multiple organs, including the lungs,
lymph nodes, eyes, heart and skin. Uneven wall motion ab￾normalities characterized by the presence of dyskinetic or
akinetic segments coexistent with normokinetic segments
have been frequently observed in patients with cardiac sar￾coidosis. On the other hand, patients with acute heart failure
(HF) caused by severely diffuse left ventricular (LV) wall
motion abnormalities mimicking acute myocarditis in the
development of cardiac sarcoidosis are extremely rare. This
case report concerns an acute HF patient with acute inflam￾mation caused by cardiac sarcoidosis who was successfully
treated with prednisolone rather than optimal pharmacologi￾cal therapy for HF.
Case Report
A 65-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus was
admitted to a local hospital in August 2011 due to an acute
onset of dyspnea and persistent fever. The patient was then
referred to our hospital in September 2011 because his acute
HF had not improved in spite of having undergone optimal
pharmacological therapy. On admission, the patient’s blood
pressure was 114/80 mm Hg, his heart rate was 112 beats
per minute, and his oxygen saturation was 89% or above on
room air. The jugular veins were distended with a prominent
v wave, indicating an elevated right atrial pressure and sig￾nificant tricuspid regurgitation. Auscultation revealed a third
heart sound and a Levine III/VI systolic murmur at the left
lower sternal border, while coarse crackles were detected in
both lower lung fields. Pitting edema was observed in both
legs. The laboratory findings showed a brain natriuretic pep￾tide level of 731 pg/mL (reference range: <18.4 pg/mL), a
C-reactive protein level of 5.66 mg/dL (reference range: <
0.3 mg/dL), a creatine kinase muscle and brain (CKMB)
level of 9.0 U/L (reference range: <12 U/L), an angiotensin
converting enzyme level of 9.3 U/L (reference range: 7.7-
29.4 U/L), and a serum calcium concentration of 8.0 mg/dL
(reference range: 8.4-9.9 mg/dL). A tuberculin skin test was
negative. Chest radiography indicated a cardiothoracic ratio
of 58% with pulmonary congestion and bilateral pleural ef￾fusions (Fig. 1A). Chest computed tomography revealed no
bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. Electrocardiography re￾Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Japan

Figure 1. (A) Chest radiography performed on admission indicated a cardiothoracic ratio of 58% 
with pulmonary congestion and bilateral pleural effusions. (Note: calcification of the right hilar area
resulting from previous aspiration of barium). (B) Electrocardiography performed on admission re￾vealed a normal sinus rhythm, right bundle-branch block, premature ventricular contractions, and
inverted T waves in V2-V3.
Figure 2. (A) Transthoracic echocardiography from the mid-left ventricular (LV) short axis view 
performed on admission showed that the LV ejection fraction (EF) calculated with the modified bi￾plane Simpson’s rule was 25%, and that the LV wall motion entailed severely diffuse hypokinesis. 
(B) Transthoracic echocardiography from the mid-LV short axis view performed five months after 
the initiation of steroid therapy demonstrated an improved LV systolic function with an LVEF of 
50%. MR: mitral regurgitation, TR: tricuspid regurgitation, PG: pressure gradient
vealed a normal sinus rhythm, right bundle-branch block,
premature ventricular contractions, and inverted T waves in
V2-V3 (Fig. 1B). A transthoracic echocardiographic examina￾tion disclosed that the LV ejection fraction (EF) calculated
with the modified biplane Simpson’s rule was 25%, the LV
end-diastolic diameter was 53 mm and the LV end systolic
diameter was 48 mm (Fig. 2A). The LV wall motion con￾sisted of severely diffuse hypokinesis with moderate mitral
regurgitation. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation was also evi￾dent and the estimated pressure difference between the right
ventricle and the atrium was 32 mmHg, which indicated the
presence of pulmonary hypertension. Coronary angiography
did not show significant stenosis, and the pulmonary capil￾lary wedge pressure was 14 mmHg, the pulmonary artery
pressure 31/15 mmHg, and the cardiac index was 1.69 L/
min/m2
. Our initial diagnosis on admission was acute HF as￾sociated with acute myocarditis based on the detection of di￾lated cardiomyopathy. The patient was treated with oxygen
inhalation, diuretics, dopamine, dobutamine and human
atrial natriuretic peptide. Although the patient’s clinical con-

Figure 3. (A) Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) disclosed late enhancement in the en￾docardial portion of the left ventricular (LV) septum and the inferior and right ventricles (arrow), 
however, no evidence of fatty infiltration or definite focal wall thinning was observed. (B) 18F-fluo￾rodeoxy glucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) imaging showed significant increase in 
uptake by the LV septum and the lateral and right ventricular (RV) walls, indicating the presence of 
active inflammation (arrow). (C) The histologic findings of the endomyocardial biopsy specimens
obtained from the right ventricle were indicative of epithelioid cell granuloma (arrow). The granulo￾mas were non-necrotizing and composed of histiocytes, and lymphocytes, which is consistent with 
the presence of sarcoidosis.
dition continued to deteriorate, we felt that further assess￾ment of acute HF due to LV dysfunction was required. Car￾diac magnetic resonance imaging revealed severely diffuse
LV systolic dysfunction with late enhancement in the endo￾cardial portion of the LV septum and in the inferior and
right ventricles, however, no evidence of fatty infiltration or
definite focal wall thinning was observed (Fig. 3A). 18F￾fluorodeoxy glucose-positron emission tomography imaging
showed significantly increased patchy uptake by the LV sep￾tum and the lateral, and right ventricular walls, indicating
the presence of active inflammation (Fig. 3B). The his￾tologic findings of the endomyocardial biopsy specimens
obtained from the right ventricle were indicative of epithe￾lioid cell granuloma (Fig. 3C). The granulomas were non￾necrotizing and composed of histiocytes, and lymphocytes,
findings that are consistent with the presence of sarcoidosis.
The final diagnosis was thus acute HF caused by cardiac
sarcoidosis with acute and active inflammation (1). No evi￾dence of extra-cardiac sarcoidosis involving the lungs,
lymph nodes, skin, liver or eyes was observed.
The patient was treated with prednisolone (40 mg/day),
and his symptoms dramatically improved. Two months after
the initiation of steroid therapy, the fluorodeoxy glucose
(FDG) uptake had significantly decreased. Furthermore,
five-months after the initiation of steroid therapy, the patient
remained in New York Heart Association functional class I,
however, transthoracic echocardiographic examination re￾vealed a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 50%
and mild mitral regurgitation (Fig. 2B). Mild tricuspid re￾gurgitation was also evident and the estimated pressure dif￾ference between the right ventricle and the atrium was 15
mmHg.
Discussion
Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease of unde￾fined cause involving multiple organs, including the lungs,
lymph nodes, eyes, heart and skin. Infiltration and resulting
damage of the myocardium are important causes of
death (2). Although autopsy studies have established that
cardiac involvement is demonstrated in 20% to 50% of
cases, cardiac sarcoidosis is symptomatic in only 5% of pa-

tients, is an independent predictor of mortality and carries a
very poor prognosis (3, 4). Although cardiac sarcoidosis en￾tails significant morbidity and mortality due to the develop￾ment of fatal arrhythmia, atrioventricular conduction distur￾bances, and refractory congestive heart failure, it is not al￾ways easy to diagnose. In addition, the patient in our case
was diagnosed with cardiac sarcoidosis, however, it was dif￾ficult to distinguish cardiac sarcoidosis from giant cell myo￾carditis. The results of the Multicenter Idiopathic Giant Cell
Myocarditis Registry suggest that cardiac sarcoidosis and
idiopathic giant cell myocarditis are distinct clinicopa￾thologic entities (5). The registry showed that, despite high
rates of heart block, HF, and tachyarrhythmias, survival
among patients with cardiac sarcoidosis is much better than
that among patients with idiopathic giant cell myocarditis.
Furthermore, a multivariate analysis revealed that presenta￾tion with HF predicts a diagnosis of idiopathic giant cell
myocarditis, while presentation with heart block or more
than nine weeks of symptoms predicts a diagnosis of cardiac
sarcoidosis.
Uneven wall motion abnormalities characterized by the
presence of dyskinetic or akinetic segments coexistent with
normokinetic segments have been frequently observed in pa￾tients with cardiac sarcoidosis, a pattern which has also been
documented in patients with myocarditis. The combination
of granulomatous infiltration and scar formation with patchy
distribution in the myocardium observed in patients with
cardiac sarcoidosis is probably related to uneven LV wall
motion. On the other hand, our patient developed acute HF
due to severely diffuse LV wall motion abnormalities, how￾ever, such mimicking of acute myocarditis in the develop￾ment of cardiac sarcoidosis is extremely rare. To the best of
our knowledge, only a few similar cases have so far been
previously reported (6-8). Our patients responded well to
steroid therapy for cardiac sarcoidosis with acute inflamma￾tion rather than to standard pharmacological therapy for
acute HF. Steroid therapy may be protective or therapeutic
for preventing LV remodeling and preservating the LV func￾tion in the early or middle stages of cardiac sarcoidosis,
however, it may not be as effective in the late stage. Early
diagnosis and appropriate management of patients with car￾diac sarcoidosis are thus essential. Moreover, sarcoid infil￾tration often occurs in the middle or epicardial portion of
the LV wall in the early stage (9, 10), and findings on car￾diac magnetic resonance imaging may reflect such a phe￾nomenon.
In conclusion, the clinical history presented here suggests
taht acute inflammation caused by sarcoidosis can lead to
acute HF with severe LV dysfunction mimicking acute myo￾carditis. It is therefore important to identify this type of car￾diac sarcoidosis at an early stage, when it can still success￾fully respond to steroid treatment.
