Abstract: A clear association between obesity and heart failure exists and 
a significant role for leptin, the product of the obese gene, has been suggested. 
One aspect of myocardial remodeling which characterizes heart failure is 
a disruption in the balance of extracellular matrix synthesis and degradation. 
Here we investigated the effects of leptin on matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 
activity, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP) expression, as well as 
collagen synthesis in HL-1 cardiac muscle cells. Gelatin zymographic analysis 
of MMP activity in conditioned media showed that leptin enhanced MMP-2 
activity in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Leptin is known to stimulate 
phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in cardiac cells and utilization of the p38 MAPK 
inhibitor, SB203580, demonstrated that this kinase also plays a role in regulating 
several extracellular matrix components, such that inhibition of p38 MAPK 
signaling prevented the leptin-induced increase in MMP-2 activation. We also 
observed that leptin enhanced collagen synthesis determined by both proline 
incorporation and picrosirius red staining of conditioned media. Pro-collagen 
type-I and pro-collagen type-III expression, measured by real-time PCR and 
Western blotting were also increased by leptin, effects which were again 
attenuated by SB203580. In summary, these results demonstrate the potential for 
leptin to play a role in mediating myocardial ECM remodeling and that the p38 
MAPK pathway plays an important role in mediating these effects.

INTRODUCTION 
Heart failure (HF) is the end-stage pathology of various cardiovascular diseases 
and is a leading cause of death [1]. HF may result from multiple myocardial 
remodeling events, some of which occur initially as beneficial adaptive changes 
but ultimately dictate the transition to heart failure [2]. A manifestation of 
myocardial remodeling is an increase in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling 
which results from dysregulated levels of collagen synthesis, and its degradation 
via the delicate balance maintained between matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 
and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) [3]. The characteristics of 
myocardial ECM remodeling are highly dependent on the disease etiology. For 
instance, following myocardial infarction, early-phase remodeling is often 
characterized by an initial degradation of the left ventricular (LV) collagen 
network [4] and late-phase remodeling is accompanied by excessive collagen 
accumulation [5]. Whereas, remodeling in pressure overload states includes 
a slower progression to cardiac fibrosis, specifically interstial fibrillar collagen 
deposition, resulting in dysfunctional chamber filling during diastole [6]. 
The connection between obesity and cardiovascular disease is well-established 
and is supported by numerous epidemiological studies [7, 8]. In addition, 
circulating levels of the adipocyte-derived hormone leptin are positively 
correlated with cardiovascular complications in obese individuals and leptin may 
serve as a causative link [2]. Concentrations of circulating leptin in lean and 
obese individuals are between 2-10 ng/ml and 10-100 ng/ml, respectively [35]. 
Leptin, although primarily produced by adipocytes [9], is additionally 
synthesized by a plethora of tissues [11-17], including the heart [10]. The 
cardiac effects of leptin have yet to be fully elucidated, however, leptin regulates 
cardiomyocyte hypertrophy [13-15, 19] hyperplasia [13], apoptosis [33] and the 
production of various myocardial matrix components by cardiomyocytes and 
cardiac fibroblasts [13, 16] 
The underlying mechanism through which obesity contributes to the 
development of cardiac fibrosis in cardiovascular disease, however, remains 
poorly understood. Moreover, the mechanism through which leptin affects 
myocardial matrix remodeling events is largely unknown. Thus, the purpose of 
this study was to examine leptin’s effects on the production and secretion of 
MMPs, TIMPs and collagen, using the HL-1 cardiomyocyte cell line. Leptin acts 
via a diverse array of signaling mechanisms [18] and here we specifically focus 
on the role of p38 MAPK that has previously been shown to mediate leptin’s 
hypertrophic effects in cardiomyocytes [13, 14, 19]. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Cell culture 
Cardiac muscle cells, designated HL-1, which are derived from AT-1 mouse 
atrial cardiomyocytes were plated in gelatin and fibronectin-coated culture 
vessels and maintained in Claycomb medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) 

CELLULAR & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY LETTERS 553 
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM norepinephrine, 2 mM 
L-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 µg/ml 
amphotericin B. Cells were grown at 37°C in 5% CO2 and were passaged into 
fresh media at ~80% confluence. 
Preparation of cell lysates and conditioned media 
Cells grown on 6 well plates were treated with recombinant murine leptin 
(6 nM) for the times indicated in figure legends, then washed quickly with ice￾cold PBS. Conditioned media obtained from cells incubated with leptin with or 
without pretreatment with the p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580 (Calbiochem, 
San Diego, CA), was collected and concentrated using the Centricon-10 system 
(Millipore, Ontario, Canada). Total protein content was determined using the 
Bradford assay (BioRad, Mississauga, Canada). 
Gelatin zymography 
Cells were stimulated with 6 or 60 nM (100 and 1000 ng/ml, respectively) 
recombinant mouse leptin (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) for the times indicated. 
In the experiments that examined the participation of p38 MAPK in leptin’s 
actions, cells were first pre-treated with 10 μM of SB203580 for 1 h prior to 
leptin stimulation. The resulting conditioned culture medium was concentrated 
using the Centricon-10 system (Millipore, Ontario, Canada) and protein content 
of the culture medium was measured as described previously [16]. Aliquots of 
culture media containing 25 μg of protein were then resolved on a 10% SDS 
polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% gelatin. The gel was rinsed for 1 h in 
a solution containing 2.5% Triton X-100 in 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) to remove 
SDS and to renature the proteins. The gel was then rinsed for 15 min in 10 mM 
Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) followed by incubation for 16 h at 37°C with gentle shaking 
in 0.05 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) with 5 mM CaCl2 to allow activation of MMPs. 
Gels were then stained for 30 min in 0.5% Coomassie blue R-250, and destained 
in 40% methanol, 10% acetic acid to highlight protease activity of MMPs. 
Protease activity was quantified using densitometric scanning and Scion Image 
software (Scion Corporation, Frederick, MA).
Western blotting 
Equal amounts of protein (~30 μg) were immunoblotted using SP1.D8 
(aminopropeptide collagen I, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa 
City, USA) and collagen type III H-300 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, California, 
USA) as previously described [16]. Quantitative analysis was performed after 
densitometric scanning using Scion Image Software.

H] Proline incorporation 
Collagen synthesis was assessed by measurement of cellular [3
H] proline 
(Amersham, Quebec, Canada) uptake as previously described [16]. Briefly, cells 
were pretreated for 1h with 10 μM SB203580 prior to stimulation with 6 nM 
recombinant mouse leptin for 24 h. [3
H] proline was added to each well at a final 

554 Vol. 15. No. 4. 2010 CELL. MOL. BIOL. LETT. 
concentration of 1 μCi/ml for 24 h. At the end of incubation, cultures were 
washed 3 times with ice cold PBS and incubated with ice-cold 5% 
trichloroacetic acid for 30 min at 4°C. After 2 rinses with cold 5% TCA, the 
acid-precipitate material was solubilized overnight in 0.5 ml of 0.5 N NaOH at 
37°C and neutralized with 0.5 ml 0.5N HCl per well. Total protein was 
determined from an aliquot and the incorporated radioactivity in the remaining 
cell lysate was measured in a liquid scintillation counter and expressed relative 
to control. 
Fibrillar collagen content 
Conditioned media from cells incubated with leptin with or without pretreatment 
with SB203580 was concentrated and analyzed as previously described [20]. 
Briefly, conditioned media samples (50 μg) were loaded into 96-well plates and 
allowed to evaporate for 48 h at 37°C in 5% CO2. Following staining with 
Picrosirius Red for 1 h and washing with 10 mM HCl, the stain was solubilized 
with 0.1 M NaOH. Conditioned media samples and the collagen standard curve 
were then analyzed via spectrophotometry at an absorbance of 540 nm. 
Real-time RT-PCR 
Cells were pretreated with the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 (10 μM) for 1 h 
prior to stimulation with recombinant mouse leptin (6 nM or 60 nM) for 24 h. 
Total RNA was prepared from cardiomyocytes using Trizol (Invitrogen, 
Burlington, Canada) according to the manufacturer's instruction. RNA integrity 
was verified by ethidium bromide staining of agarose gels and by an optical 
density (OD) absorption ratio OD 260 nm/OD 280 nm > 1.9. One µg of total 
RNA was reverse transcribed with Superscript II RNAse H-reverse transcriptase 
using random hexamers (Invitrogen, Burlington, Canada) according to the 
manufacturer's instructions. Real-time PCR analyses were performed using 
20 ng of reverse transcribed total RNA with 200 nM of both sense and antisense 
primers in a final volume of 20 μl using the SYBR Green PCR core reagent 
(Invitrogen, Burlington, Canada) in an ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection 
System Instrument (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). To ensure that 
a single amplicon of the expected size was produced by RT-PCR, samples were 
also analyzed on ethidium bromide stained agarose. 18S ribosomal subunit 
amplification was used routinely to control for variability in the initial quantities 
of cDNA. Relative quantitation for any given gene, expressed as fold variation 
over control, was calculated after determination of the difference between cycle 
threshold (Ct) value of the given gene according to manufacturers protocol using 
the formula 2-Δ(ΔCtA-ΔCtB). Cycling conditions consisted of an initial denaturation 
step of 95°C for 3 min as a ‘hot start’ followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 30 s at 
the noted annealing temperature of each primer set (see Tab. 1) for 30 s, 72°C 
for 30 s and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min.

Statistical analysis 
Statistical analyses were performed using a one-way ANOVA or paired 
student’s T-test, as appropriate (SigmaStat 3.1, Chicago, IL). Tukey post-hoc 
comparisons were made when statistical significance (p < 0.05) was detected 
between observations. Data are presented as means ± SEM. 
RESULTS 
We first confirmed mRNA expression of both the long (obRb) and short (obRa) 
forms of the leptin receptor in HL-1 cardiomyocytes (data not shown). We then 
investigated the effects of leptin on MMP activity by gelatin zymography and 
found that MMP-2 activity was significantly increased following 6 nM or 
60 nM leptin treatment (Fig. 1A). These concentrations were chosen based on 
initial dose dependent response experiments, published data and the fact that 
6nM represents circulating leptin levels in obese patients. In addition, 6 h or 24 h 
of 6 nM leptin treatment resulted in a similar significant 1.3-fold or 1.4-fold 
increase above basal in MMP-2 activity, respectively (Fig. 1B). p38 MAPK has 
previously been shown to be activated by leptin in a variety of cardiac cell types 
[13,14,19]. Therefore, to investigate if p38 MAPK participates in the leptin￾induced increase in MMP-2 activity, HL-1 cells were pretreated with the p38 
MAPK inhibitor (SB203580) prior to leptin stimulation. As shown in Fig. 1C, 
SB203580 alone had no effect on basal, while the stimulatory effect of leptin on 
MMP-2 activity was attenuated in cells pre-treated with SB203580. We 
observed that SB203580 inhibited leptin-induced MMP-2 activity below that of 
basal condition but when compared with SB203580 alone there was no

significant difference (Fig. 1). In contrast, inhibition of PI3-kinase (LY294002) 
or ERK1/2 (PD98059) did not alter leptin’s effects on MMP-2 activity (data not 
shown).

TIMP-1, 2, 3 and 4 mRNA levels were analyzed following 24 h leptin treatment 
in the presence or absence of SB203580. HL-1 cells exhibit minimal expression 
of TIMP-2, 3 and 4 mRNA (data not shown), but we observed that leptin caused 
a significant reduction in TIMP-1 mRNA (Fig. 2). Pre-treatment with SB203580 
prevented the leptin-induced reduction in TIMP-1 mRNA although somewhat 
surprisingly, SB203580 treatment alone reduced TIMP-1 expression, perhaps 
suggesting that constitutive endogenous p38 MAPK activity plays a role in tonic 
TIMP-1 turnover (Fig. 2).

Collagen is rich in the amino acid proline and tracing [3
H]-proline uptake is 
routinely used as a measure of collagen synthesis. Here we demonstrate that in 
HL-1 cells, leptin (6 nM) treatment for 24 h resulted in a significant 1.3-fold 
above basal increase in proline incorporation (Fig. 3A). Pre-treatment of cells 
with SB203580 reduced this stimulatory effect of leptin to basal values, while 
the inhibitor alone had no effect on proline incorporation. We also examined 
extracellular content of fibrillar collagen via analysis of HL-1 conditioned 
media. Leptin treatment for 24 h significantly increased the accumulation of 
fibrillar collagen in conditioned media by 1.4-fold (Fig. 3B). Moreover, pre￾treatment with SB203580 followed by leptin for 24 h resulted in attenuation of 
leptin-induced stimulation of fibrillar collagen secretion (Fig. 3B).

leptin for 24 h with or without a 1h pre-treatment with 10 μM SB203580 (present 
continuously during the treatment periods), was utilized to examine pro-collagen I (A) and 
pro-collagen III (B) mRNA expression. Protein expression of amino propeptide α-1 (C) 
and collagen-III (D) were analyzed as described in Materials and Methods. Data are means 
± SEM (n = 4 independent experiments), expressed relative to basal. *p < 0.05 vs. basal, #
p < 0.05 vs. leptin alone. 

CELLULAR & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY LETTERS 559 
We next examined the effect of leptin on collagen-I and –III expression. Leptin 
treatment for 24 h significantly increased procollagen-I (1.5-fold above basal) 
and procollagen-III (15-fold above basal) mRNA levels (Figs 4A and 4B). These 
stimulatory effects of leptin were attenuated in cells pre-treated with SB203580, 
while SB203580 alone was without effect (Figs 4A and 4B). We also examined 
the effects of leptin on protein expression of collagen-I and -III isoforms. Amino 
propeptides are by-products of procollagen cleavage, which is an integral step in 
 the assembly of mature collagen fibers and thus are useful indicators of fibrillar 
collagen content. As shown in Fig. 4C, leptin enhanced procollagen type I amino 
propeptide levels 1.4-fold and this increase was abolished following pre￾treatment with SB203580. Similar results were obtained upon analysis of 
collagen α1 type III levels (Fig. 4D). 
DISCUSSION 
Numerous studies suggest that leptin is an important mediator of pathological 
cardiac remodeling [13, 14, 17, 19, 21-24], which is characterized by 
cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and a disruption of the ECM resulting in increased 
collagen deposition [1, 3]. Here we investigated the effect of leptin on regulation 
of myocardial matrix components, specifically MMP-2 activity, TIMP-1 
expression and collagen-I/-III expression, in HL-1 cardiomyocytes. 
Altered activation of MMP-2 is known to contribute to the development of 
cardiac fibrosis in failing hearts [26-28]. We show here that leptin stimulates 
MMP-2 activation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. We and others have 
similarly revealed enhanced MMP proteolytic activity by leptin in cardiac 
fibroblasts [16], ventricular cardiomyocytes [13] and aortic endothelial cells 
[29]. Functional activity of MMPs is not only dependent on mRNA or protein 
levels; post-translational regulation via TIMPs is an important component since 
modifications in the MMP:TIMP ratio can oppose the hydrolytic capacity of 
MMPs [3]. Our data showed that expression of the endogenous MMP inhibitor, 
TIMP-1, is decreased following leptin stimulation. Although functional data for 
TIMP-1 is not available, our data suggests that in HL-1 cardiomyocytes, leptin 
may regulate the activity of MMP-2 indirectly via attenuating the expression its 
natural inhibitor, TIMP-1 and altering the MMP:TIMP ratio. Somewhat 
surprisingly, SB203580 treatment alone reduced TIMP-1 expression, perhaps 
suggesting that constitutive endogenous p38 MAPK activity plays a role in tonic 
TIMP-1 turnover. 
A direct consequence of altered MMP activity is excessive accumulation or 
degradation of a diverse array of ECM proteins, of which fibrillar collagen is the 
predominant substrate targeted by cardiac MMP-2 [28]. In the present study, we 
found that leptin mediates the expression of this triple-helical protein at various 
steps of the collagen biosynthesis pathway. Intracellular accumulation of total 
collagen was stimulated by leptin, as well as mRNA expression of the 
predominant isoforms found in cardiac tissue, collagen-I and –III. Although 

560 Vol. 15. No. 4. 2010 CELL. MOL. BIOL. LETT. 
collagen-III mRNA expression increased substantially (15-fold), an augmentation 
of similar magnitude was not observed in the total intracellular collagen pools 
likely because this isoform makes up a small proportion of total cardiac collagen 
(< 10%), while collagen-1 accounts for approximately 80% and additional 
isoforms (ie. collagen-IV) comprise the remaining 10% (1). Furthermore, it is 
not surprising that collagen-III mRNA levels do not reflect secreted protein 
levels when the complexity of the various regulatory steps involved in the 
production, processing, secretion and assembly of collagen are considered. 
Indeed, asynchronous mRNA and protein expression levels in cardiac tissue 
have been reported previously [34]. Extracellular collagen accumulation was 
similarly affected such that collagen-I, -III and total fibrillar collagen were 
increased, however to a lesser degree when compared to leptin’s effects on 
procollagen expression. This discrepancy may be due to leptin’s ability to 
concurrently enhance MMP-2 proteolytic activity, of which collagen is 
a potential substrate. Collectively, these results suggest that leptin increases the 
synthesis and consequently the accumulation of collagen in the extracellular 
space. One would reason that an enhanced MMP-2 activity would be paralleled 
by reduction in collagen accumulation in the extracellular space. Yet, as 
previously mentioned this was not the observation in the present study. We 
previously found that leptin similarly increases the expression of various MMPs 
as well as collagen accumulation [13, 16]. A likely explanation may be that the 
promoter regions of MMP-2 and collagen-I/III mutually utilize AP-1 consensus 
recognition sites, both of which can be stimulated by leptin (discussed in 
additional detail below). Additionally, leptin’s ability to increase MMP-2 
activity, resulting in increased collagen degradation, may obscure any direct 
effects of leptin on collagen extracellular accumulation. 
Leptin is known to engage the p38 MAPK pathway to elicit its physiological and 
pathological responses in cardiomyocytes including hypertrophy and hyperplasia 
[13, 14, 19]. In the present study, we show that in HL-1 cardiomyocytes, leptin 
utilizes the p38-MAPK pathway to alter the expression of TIMP-1, MMP-2, as 
well as collagen-I and –III. Downstream targets of p38 MAPK include a myriad 
of transcription factors including activating transcription factor (ATF)-2, which 
has been implicated in the regulation of MMP-2 gene expression [30]. Since 
leptin is known to enhance ATF2 activity [31], it is plausible that these 
transcription factors stimulate MMP-2 promoter activity via leptin-mediated p38 
MAPK activation. In a similar manner, leptin is known to stimulate the 
transcriptional activity of procollagen α2(I) via another p38 MAPK downstream 
target, AP-1, which binds c-Jun and c-Fos and is located upstream of the 
COL1A2 promoter [32]. As previously mentioned, the concurrent increase in 
MMP-2 activity with collagen expression in conditioned media is unexpected as 
increased collagen degradation likely follows upregulation of its primary 
hydrolytic enzyme, MMP-2. However, various studies demonstrating the 
utilization of ATF-2 and AP-1 in MMP-2 and collagen-I/III transcriptional 
activation respectively, provides evidence that transactivation of these factors, 

CELLULAR & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY LETTERS 561 
both of which are downstream mediators in p38 MAPK signaling, are potential 
targets of leptin activation of p38 MAPK. Additional studies are required further 
address these potential mechanisms. 
In summary, our study demonstrates that in HL-1 cardiomyocytes, leptin acts via 
the p38 MAPK pathway to regulate cellular events which can contribute to 
myocardial matrix remodeling, specifically, MMP-2 activation, as well as total, 
type-I and -III collagen expression. Further understanding of the potential 
contribution of leptin signaling to myocardial matrix remodeling may ultimately 
aid in generating novel therapeutic strategies targeting cardiac remodeling in the 
clinical settings of obesity and HF.
