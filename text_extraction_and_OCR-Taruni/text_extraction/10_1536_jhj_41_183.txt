SUMMARY
Various cytokines play important roles in the pathogenesis of congestive
heart failure. TNF-α is one of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, and IL-10 has
anti-inflammatory actions. The -308 (G / A) polymorphism of the TNF-α gene
(TNFA1 and A2) and the single base -1082 (G / A) polymorphism of the IL-10
gene (IL-10 1*
G and 1*
A) have been identified as causing alterations to the in
vivo production of TNF-α and IL-10, respectively. We examined TNF-α and
IL-10 gene polymorphisms using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction
fragment length polymorphism technique in 48 Japanese patients with
idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. The frequency of these polymorphisms was
compared with 50 healthy Japanese. The clinical courses, such as disease
onset, left ventricular function, progression during the follow up period and
hospitalization from congestive heart failure, were also analyzed. Serum
TNF-α levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) technique in the patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy to
reveal the correlation with genotypes. Patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy
or other secondary cardiomyopathies were excluded from this study. The allele
frequency of TNFA2 in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy was significantly
higher than that of the healthy group (13.5 % and 3.0 %, respectively, p =
0.0084). There was no difference in the allele frequency of the IL-10 gene
between the two groups. Polymorphism of the TNFA2 gene was not associated
with the clinical course. Serum TNF-α levels were elevated in the patient
group compared with the healthy group. There were no differences in serum

VARIOUS cytokines have been demonstrated to play important roles in the
pathogenesis of patients with heart failure. The proinflammatory cytokine
tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) contributes to myocardial dysfunction by a
variety of mechanisms.1,2) Several clinical studies have shown that circulating
levels of TNF-α are elevated in patients with congestive heart failure.3-5) Because
of the complex network among cytokines, the activities of pro-inflammatory
cytokines are influenced by anti-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-10
(IL-10). Some reports showed high serum concentrations of IL-10 in patients
with congestive heart failure.6,7) Accordingly, these cytokines may be related to
the pathogenesis of dilated cardiomyopathy.
Recently some studies have revealed that cytokine production is influenced
by cytokine gene polymorphisms. There are two biallelic polymorphisms at the
-308 position of the TNF-α promoter lesion: a G-to-A transition (G = TNFA1, A
= TNFA2).8) A TNFA2 allele is associated with high TNF-α production by high
transcriptional activation.9) The polymorphism at position -1082 of the IL-10
promoter lesion, a G to A transition, correlated with IL-10 production in vitro
(alleles designated IL-10 1*
G and 1*
A).10) IL-10 production in IL-10 1*
A
negative lymphocytes was significantly increased compared to IL-10 1*
A
positive lymphocytes. Clinically, the TNFA2 allele is more prevalent in patients
with rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus than in the normal
population.11) There is only one report concerning TNF-α polymorphism in
patients with congestive heart failure.12) The report showed that the TNF-α
polymorphism was not related to the presence of congestive heart failure nor the
level of circulating TNF-α. Gene polymorphisms have occasionally been variable
among the races, so that study might have contained several races. Furthermore,
there were a variety of causes of the congestive heart failure in the study. IL-10
polymorphism has not yet been studied in patients with heart diseases. In this
study, we have examined TNF-α and IL-10 gene polymorphisms in Japanese
patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.
METHODS
Subjects: Forty-eight Japanese patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy
(mean age 57.5 ± 15.2; 34 men, 14 women) and fifty age-matched healthy
TNF-α levels between the patients with TNFA1 and those with TNFA2. In conclusion,
the TNFA2 allele may be linked to the pathogenesis of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy
in Japanese patients. (Jpn Heart J 2000; 41: 183-191)

Japanese controls (mean age 53.4 ± 14.7; 35 men, 15 women) were included in
this study. Informed consent was obtained from all patients before blood
sampling. The clinical diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy was confirmed
according to the report of the 1995 World Health Organization.13) All patients
had left ventricular dilatation (end diastolic diameter > 5.5 cm) and showed
impaired left ventricular function (left ventricular ejection fraction < 40 %, or
fractional shortening < 25 %). The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) history
of myocardial infarction, (2) history of alcohol abuse, (3) evidence of coronary
heart disease or valvular heart disease by cardiac catheterization, (4) active
myocarditis or post-myocarditic state, and (5) secondary heart muscle diseases.
All patients underwent transthoracic echocardiography and cardiac catheteriza￾tion. Echocardiography was serially recorded in each patient during follow up
(mean follow up period was 5.3 ± 4.3 years). The clinical characteristics of the
patients at baseline are summarized in Table I.
Serum samples: Blood samples were obtained from the patients with idiopathic
dilated cardiomyopathy and the healthy control subjects. Blood samples were
immediately centrifuged to separate the serum and kept at − 80 °C.
Analysis of TNF-α and IL-10 gene polymorphisms: Genomic DNA was extracted
from peripheral blood using a Sepa Gene Kit (Sanko Junyaku Co., Ltd, Tokyo).
Primers 5’-AGGCAATAGGTTTTGAGGGCCAT-3’ and 5’-TCCTCCCTGCTC
CGATTCCG-3’ were used to amplify a DNA fragment containing the -308
position of the TNF-α gene in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR were
run for 35 cycles: 1 minute at 94 °C, 1 minute at 60 °C, and 1 minute at 72 °C.
PCR products containing the -308 position of TNF-α were digested by Nco-I
(New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA, USA) at 37 °C for over 4 hours.
Primers 5’-TCCCTTACTTTCCTCTTACCTA-3’ and 5’-ACACAAATCCA
AGACAACACTA-3’ were used to amplify a DNA fragment containing the -1082
position of the IL-10 gene. The PCR conditions were the same as for TNF-α
typing. PCR products containing the -1082 position of IL-10 were digested by

Both digests were separated by 12 % polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and
visualized by ethydium bromide staining. A TNFA1 allele gives two fragments of
87 bp and 20 bp, and a TNFA2 allele gives a single 107 bp fragment. An IL-10
1*
G allele gives three fragments (31 bp, 23 bp and 21 bp) and an IL-10 1*
A
allele gives two fragments (54 bp and 21 bp).
Measurements of serum TNF-α levels by ELISA: For the measurement of serum
TNF-α, a TNF-α Enzyme Immunoassay Kit (Code No. 1121, Immunotech,
Marseille, France) was used. After completion of the reaction, the samples were
applied to electrophotometry to measure absorbency at the wavelength of 405 nm.
The sensitivity limit of the assay was 5 pg / ml.
Statistical Analysis: The results are shown as the mean ± standard deviation.
Fisher’s exact test was used for statistical analysis of the frequencies of TNF-α
and IL-10 gene polymorphisms between the two groups. The association
between the clinical course and gene polymorphisms was analyzed by the
unpaired 2-tailed t test. Serum TNF-α levels in the healthy controls, patients with
TNFA1, and those with TNFA2 were analyzed by the Kruskal-Wallis test.
Further analysis was performed with Mann-Whitney’s U test. Differences were
considered significant at a value of p < 0.05.
RESULTS
TNF-α: The frequency of TNFA2 in the control group was 3.0 % and this value
was similar to a prior report for Japanese.14) The frequency of TNFA2 was 13.5 %
in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. The frequency of TNFA2 of
patients was significantly higher than that of the controls (p = 0.0084) (Table II).
TNF-α -308 position polymorphisms were not associated with clinical character￾istics, hemodynamic variables, or clinical courses (Table III). Serum TNF-α
levels of patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 17, 26.0 ± 14.3)
were higher than those of the control (n = 7, 2.5 ± 4.0) (p < 0.05). There were no

DISCUSSION
The frequency of the TNFA2 allele was high in Japanese patients with
idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy compared to the normal controls. This is the
first report which revealed an association between TNF-α polymorphism and
idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. A previous study demonstrated that TNF-α
polymorphism was not related to the presence of congestive heart failure.12)
There may be two reasons to explain the difference between the previous report
and the present study. The first reason is the different races studied. The etiology
of dilated cardiomyopathy may be diverse among races or countries, similar to
Chagas’ disease.15) The second reason may be related to differences in the
underlying diseases of the study groups. This study included only patients with
idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. The previous study contained patients with
congestive heart failure caused by miscellaneous etiologies, such as ischemic
heart disease, cardiomyopathy and other diseases. At least in Japanese, the
TNFA2 allele seems to be associated with the pathogenesis of idiopathic dilated
cardiomyopathy.
How is the TNFA2 allele linked to the pathogenesis of dilated car￾diomyoapthy? A previous study revealed that TNFA gene polymorphisms might
modulate cytokine production.9) The TNFA2 allele has the potential to produce
high levels of TNF-α under stimulated conditions. Recently, chronic overexpres￾sion of TNF-α has been demonstrated to lead to myocarditis and to result in the
development of dilated cardiomyopathy in transgenic mice.16) Another study
188

189 Vol 41
No 2 POLYMORPHISMS OF GENES IN DCM
reported that immunoreactivity for TNF-α was observed in the myocardium of
idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy but was not observed in ischemic heart
disease.17) Serum levels of TNF-α have been reported to be increased in patients
with congestive heart failure.4,18) In this study, the serum levels of TNF-α were
higher in the patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy than in control
subjects. Although the circulating levels of TNF-α showed no significant
difference between patients with TNFA1 and those with TNFA2, patients with
TNFA2 may have the potential to produce high levels of TNF-α under stimulated
conditions. The patients examined in this study were in a stable state. In patients
with TNFA2, infectious or inflammatory stimuli may produce high levels of
TNF-α either in the systemic circulation or in the myocardium. Accordingly, the
TNFA2 allele may be an important risk factor for idiopathic dilated car￾diomyopathy.
The IL-10 -1082 polymorphism was not related to the presence of this
disease in this study. IL-10 is one of the anti-inflammatory cytokines and its
production is, in part, induced by TNF-α in an autoregulatory feedback manner.19)
We hypothesized that the IL-10 1*
A allele might be related to the pathogenesis of
idiopathic dilated cardiomyoapthy because of a low potentiality to produce IL-10.
There was no relation between IL-10 -1082 polymorphism and the presence or
severity of the disease. Because the frequency of the IL-10 1*
A / A genotype was
very low, further study is needed to clarify this issue.
In order to clarify the genetic background of idiopathic dilated car￾diomyopathy, the association between gene polymorphisms and prevalence of this
disease has been investigated for various genes. The angiotensin-converting
enzyme gene and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes have been shown to
possibly contribute to the pathogenesis of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.20)
Associations between diseases and gene polymorphisms imply that proteins
encoded in the gene directly play roles in the pathogenesis of the disease.
Another possibility is that a third party of genes neighboring the indicated genes
exhibiting polymorphisms are the fundamental disease-related genes. The genes
encoding TNF-α are located between HLA-B and HLA-DR.21) Both HLA and
TNF-α play important roles in infection and immune reactions. Therefore,
infectious-immune abnormalities may be predisposing factors of idiopathic
dilated cardiomyopathy. Another possibility is that the ultimate disease-related
genes exist in the vicinity of the HLA and TNF-α genes.
In conclusion, the frequency of the TNFA2 allele was significantly higher in
patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy than in normal Japanese
volunteers. The presence of the TNFA2 allele may be linked to the pathogenesis
of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy in Japanese patients or in Japan.
