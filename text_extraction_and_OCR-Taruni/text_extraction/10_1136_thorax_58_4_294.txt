Abstract
Background: Exacerbations are an important feature of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), accounting for a large
proportion of health care costs. They are associated with increased
airway inflammation and oxidative stress.
Methods: Concentrations of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), a marker of
inflammation, and 8-isoprostane, a marker of oxidative stress, were
measured in the exhaled breath condensate of 21 patients (11 M)
with COPD during an exacerbation and 2 weeks after treatment
with antibiotics. In 12 patients who had no further exacerbations
these markers were also measured after 2 months.
Results: LTB4 concentrations were raised during the COPD
exacerbation (mean (SE) 15.8 (1.1) pg/ml and fell after treatment
with antibiotics to 9.9 (0.9) pg/ml (p<0.0001). In 12 patients the
level of LTB4 fell further from 10.6 (1.1) pg/ml to 8.5 (0.8) pg/ml
(p<0.005) after 2 months. In 12 normal age matched subjects the
LTB4 levels were 7.7 (0.5) pg/ml. Concentrations of 8-isoprostane
were also increased during the exacerbation (13.0 (0.9) pg/ml) and
fell after antibiotic treatment to 9.0 (0.6) pg/ml (p<0.0001). In 12
patients there was a further fall from 9.3 (0.7) pg/ml to 6.0 (0.7)
pg/ml (p<0.001) after 2 months compared with normal subjects
(6.2 (0.4) pg/ml).
Conclusions: Non-invasive markers of inflammation and oxidative
stress are increased during an infective exacerbation of COPD and
only slowly recover after treatment with antibiotics.
