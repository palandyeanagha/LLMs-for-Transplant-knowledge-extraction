Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides the opportunity of tracking cells in vivo. Major challenges in
dissecting cells from the recipient tissue and signal sensitivity constraints albeit exist. In this study, we aimed
to tackle these limitations in order to study inflammation in autoimmune encephalomyelitis. We
constructed a very small dual-tunable radio frequency (RF) birdcage probe tailored for 19F (fluorine) and 1
H
(proton) MR mouse neuroimaging. The novel design eliminated the need for extra electrical components on
the probe structure and afforded a uniform Bz
1 -field as well as good SNR. We employed fluorescently￾tagged 19F nanoparticles and could study the dynamics of inflammatory cells between CNS and lymphatic
system during development of encephalomyelitis, even within regions of the brain that are otherwise not
easily visualized by conventional probes. 19F/1
H MR Neuroimaging will allow us to study the nature of
immune cell infiltration during brain inflammation over an extensive period of time.
I
nflammation is a key player in several disorders of the central nervous system (CNS). In autoimmune
encephalomyelitis a recruitment of immune cells to the CNS occurs early during the pathogenesis, prior to
the onset of neurological symptoms1–3. The tracking of immune cells into the brain and spinal cord is thus
pivotal for understanding the development of CNS inflammation in preclinical animal models such as
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Strategies for following cells in the CNS during EAE
have commonly made use of iron oxide nanoparticles that reduce T2* relaxation4–7. One drawback of these
contrast agents is the difficulty to distinguish the negative contrast created by the labeled cells from other
intrinsic tissue contrasts. This, together with the lack of an a priori knowledge of the kinetics of immune cell
migration during inflammation, makes the localization of immune cells in the CNS a challenging task. The
use of fluorine (19F)-rich nanoparticles to track inflammatory cells, in conjunction with 19F/1
H MRI, is an
emerging approach for cell tracking8
. Due to the absence of organic 19F in vivo, 19F/1
H MRI is advantageous
for localizing transplanted cells in vivo since it permits background-free images with complete signal select￾ivity and specificity. The possibility of quantifying the cell signal by 19F MR spectroscopy is another advant￾age.
One major limitation when tracking immune cells in the CNS with 19F/1
H MRI is the low signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) for both 19F and 1
H signals. The SNR and the sensitivity of the radio frequency (RF) probe used are indeed
main determinants that dictate the level of spatial resolution9
. Factors to be kept in mind when designing a probe
include the geometry, the filling factor and the homogeneity of the Bz
1 -transmit field. Small-sized birdcage probes
are ideal for mouse neuroimaging but are quite challenging to build due to size and increased risk of inaccurate
assembly of chip capacitors that could distort the circuit symmetry and RF homogeneity. The millipede design
was developed to eliminate the necessity of chip capacitors10. However millipede probes are too complex to be
modified as double-tunable probes; an assembly of two spiral coils would need to be constructed to achieve a
double resonant setup10 but this results in an undesirable sensitivity difference between outer and inner coils. In
order to track inflammatory cells in vivo with 19F/1
H MRI, a dual-tunable RF probe is desirable in order to

safeguard sensitivity and B1-field homogeneity on both frequencies
and to avoid inaccurate co-registration of both signals11.
In this study we constructed a novel dual-tunable 19F/1
H birdcage
probe with a shingled-leg design in order to detect immune cell
infiltration in the mouse brain during encephalomyelitis. Thirty
two copper strips were arranged in parallel to form a cylinder and
overlapped with strips extending from the end rings of the RF probe.
This provided plate capacitance on each leg, thereby eliminating the
necessity of solid chip capacitors. With our RF probe we were able to
detect inflammatory cell infiltrates as 19F signal in EAE mice follow￾ing in vivo administration of fluorescently-labeled 19F-rich particles.
We observed immune cell penetration even in regions of the CNS e.g.
anterior region of brainstem and spinal cord that are otherwise not
easily visualized by conventional RF probes due to limited depth
penetration.
Results
Electromagnetic field simulations and performance of the RF
head. We first performed simulations with a finite integration
technique (MWS) using a shield diameter of 58 mm and
determined that we require a capacitance of 1.14 pF in order to
tune to 400 MHz (1
H frequency at 9.4 Tesla). These results were in
close agreement with those calculated using an analytical method
(Birdcage Builder), in which we determined a required capacitance
of 1.17 pF (,3% deviation). Since the calculated capacitor values
were small (Figure 1) and considering the need for accuracy,
especially in the increments between the capacitors, we decided to
circumvent conventional chip capacitors during construction of the
birdcage. Instead we introduced a shingled birdcage design, in which
capacitors were built, with high accuracy, into the structure of the RF
probe. For this the copper milling on either side of the PCB was done

consisting of long copper strip-lines (shown in black) that overlap with the peripheral copper strip-lines (shown in white) connected together by the end
rings. Out of 32 legs, 28 copper-strips were uniformly overlapped by an area of 6.27 mm2 to achieve a center frequency of 388 MHz, 2 strip-lines (marked
with *) overlapped by a smaller area (3.14 mm2
) to tune for 1
H at 400 MHz (for 9.4 Tesla) and 2 strip-lines (marked with **) overlapped by an area of
9.39 mm2 to tune for 19F at 376 MHz (for 9.4 Tesla). The probe axis is aligned with the direction of the static magnetic field Bo. (B) Circuit diagram of the

H mode and C2 (2.08 pF)
capacitors (created by the 2 legs with 9.39 mm2 overlap) that tune the other port to 19F mode. C1m/C2m are the matching capacitors and C1t/C2t the

performance with respect to the scattering (S) parameters shows that port 1 (1

coefficients on both ports (S11 and S22) are shown to be lower than 240 dB and the coupling between the ports (S12 and S21) is shown to be lower than
-15 dB.

in a way to create an overlap between the inner and outer copper
strips, thereby creating plate capacitors along the length of the
birdcage legs (Figure 1A–1C). To fine tune to the exact 1
H
(400 MHz) and 19F (376 MHz) frequencies required at 9.4 Tesla,
the shield diameter was reduced from 58 mm (used for the first
simulations) to 48 mm. This shield diameter was used for the
construction of the coil design as well as for the final EMF
simulations. Based on the required capacitance results calculated
from MWS and the Birdcage Builder, an overlap of 6.27 mm2
(equivalent to 1.38 pF) was used for the simulation (Figure 2A–2D)
and ultimate construction (Figure 1C) in order for the birdcage to
resonate at a main frequency of 388 MHz that is approximately half
way between 1
H and 19F when calculating the square root of the
product of both frequencies ( ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi
400  376 p ~387:81 MHz).
Upon evaluation of the Bz
1 profiles in the EMF simulations for this
setup (Figure 2A), we observed high Bz
1 homogeneity throughout
the whole birdcage probe for both 1
H and 19F modes (Figure 2B and
Supplementary Figure 1). However, EMF simulations (particularly
Bz
1 distribution) are only an estimation for a given setup, which does
not take power losses into consideration. We therefore compared the
Bz
1 field values achieved from the EMF simulation with real Bz
1 field
values measured with the constructed birdcage probe in a 9.4 Tesla
animal scanner for the 1
H channel (Figure 2C). For both simulation
and measurement experiments, the same input power and absorbed
tissue power in the phantom were employed (ignoring powers losses
in cables, plugs and baluns). We calculated a maximum Bz
1 profile of
40 mT=HW for the simulations and 31 mT=HW for the measurement
at the center of the slice (Figure 2C, 2D). The Bz
1 profile over the
cross-section of the cylindrical phantom ranged from 38–
40 mT=HW for the measurement and 29–31 mT=HW for the simu￾lation (Figure 2D). The factor of 1.66 between Bz
1 simulations and
Bz
1 measurements translates to a power attenuation of about 2.2 dB.
This power attenuation is in agreement with losses in the RF chain
(from amplifier to probe) that we could estimate from the properties
of the cable and using the network analyzer.
Owing to the shingled design of the birdcage with variable overlaps
between the copper strips, the RF probe could be tuned to both 1
H
and 19F frequencies. With this setup, the reflection coefficients (S11
and S22) were below 240 dB for both frequencies (Figure 1D). The
transmission coefficients (S12 and S21) determine the extent of power
lost via transmission between the 2 ports and was below 215 dB
thereby not necessitating additional decoupling capacitors. Using the
reflection coefficients we could measure the RF probe/coil quality as
QFactor. This determines the extent of noise contribution coming
from the RF probe or sample. We thus measured the QFactor of both
loaded (QL) and unloaded (QU) RF probe using the formula
‘‘Q~fr=BW’’ where fr is the specific resonance frequency
(400 MHz for 1
H) and BW is the corresponding bandwidth fre￾quency at half maximum peak. We calculated QU to be 130. QL
was calculated to be 80–110, depending on the load of the probe,
the size of the mouse or conductivity of the phantom). For 376 MHz
( 19F), Q-values were similar (QU < 150).

to administer one single shot of 19F-rich nanoparticles with high 19F
content (corresponding to 40 mmoles) at the start of disease.
Following 24 hours of nanoparticle application, we performed 19F
PRESS to determine the 19F signal in the regions where we could
detect hypointense lesions. For this, we localized a 3 mm3 PRESS
voxel around the cerebellum (Figure 3A, 3C) and another PRESS
voxel around the hypointense lesion within the cortex (Figure 3D,
3F). In contrast to the selected region within the cortex (Figure 3E),
we could detect a strong 19F signal in the PRESS voxel in the
cerebellum (Figure 3B), where we also observed larger areas of
anatomical alterations using the 1
H gradient echo sequence
(Figure 3A). With the help of a calibration measurement we
calculated the 19F content within the cerebellum to be c. 60 nmoles.
Next, we wanted to determine the location of the 19F signal dis￾tributed within the cerebellum using 19F/1
H MRI. To do so, we
selected a 3 mm sagittal slice through the brain (Figure 4A), which
encloses the 3 mm3 PRESS voxel, and acquired 19F gradient echo
(FLASH) images. When we overlaid the T2-weighted 1
H image (in￾plane spatial resolution (73 3 73) mm2
) of the median sagittal slice
(Figure 4B) with the 19F image (Figure 4C) of the same sagittal
section we observed co-localization of the 19F signal to the brain stem
and mostly the cerebellum, particularly in the white matter
(Figure 4D). Following these 19F/1
H MRI measurements we
extracted the brain and prepared the cerebellum for electron micro￾scopy. Already with the help of Differential Interference Contrast
microscopy, we observed small, round and white particles engulfed
within macrophage-like cells that were infiltrating the cerebellar
lesions (Figure 4E). Electron microscopy revealed these particles as
bright smooth spheroids clustered within phagosomes in the cyto￾plasm of macrophage-like cells (Fig 4F–4H).
Considering the highly homogeneous field provided by our MR
head probe, we decided to implement accelerated spin echo tech￾niques that are otherwise very sensitive to fluctuations in the Bz
1
field13,14. Apart from altering the scanning method, we also changed
the protocol of systemic 19F nanoparticle administration. We injected
nanoparticles (same particle size but 5 mmoles 19F content) daily,
starting from day 5 following immunization. The first MRI measure￾ments were performed on the first day of symptoms. First we
acquired an in vivo 1

tion of 125 mm3
. Following this, we performed a 19F MR TurboRARE
sequence in the same mouse after it had undergone terminal anesthe￾sia. For this, we employed the following 19F MR protocol: TR 5
1000 ms, TE 5 6 ms, scan time 5 690 min, FOV 5 (40 3 16 3
16) mm3
, Matrix 5 100 3 40 3 40, zero fill acceleration 5 2, RARE
Factor 5 40, NEX 5 2048, leading to a reconstructed isotropic
resolution of 400 mm3
. When we overlaid the acquired 19F scans with
the previous 1
H images, we observed that areas of inflammatory cell
involvement were mostly within the spinal cord, brain stem, cere￾bellum and cerebral cortex (also in close proximity to the ventricles)
as shown in horizontal (Figure 5A) and sagittal (Figure 5B) serial
images of the brain. We also detected a strong 19F signal within the
cervical draining lymph nodes, areas of expected high inflammatory
cell activity. These scans were the first to reveal the uptake of 19F
nanoparticles by immune cells and their extensive infiltration of
these cells throughout the CNS and secondary lymphatic organs as
shown by 19F MRI.
In order to follow the dynamics of inflammatory cells during EAE
in vivo, we altered the above 19F MR protocol to reduce the acquisi￾tion time to 68 min. Following acquisition of the above 1
H 3D
TurboRARE sequence, we performed an in vivo 19F MRI using the
following protocol: TR 5 800 ms, TE 5 6 ms, FOV 5 (40 3 16 3
16) mm3
, Matrix 5 100 3 40 3 40, zero fill acceleration 2, RARE
Factor 5 40, NEX 5 256. Similarly to the longer 19F scans in the
previous ex vivo experiments, the 19F signals that we detected in vivo
were mostly located within draining lymph nodes, the spinal cord,
brain stem, cerebellum and cerebral cortex (Figure 6A). Typically,
the draining lymph nodes were the first to give a 19F signal (between
day 5 and day 8); the 19F signal extended from the submandibular and
superficial cervical lymph nodes into the deeper cervical, facial and
internal jugular lymph nodes. Between day 8 and day 11 we observed
immune cell infiltration in the CNS.

We next wanted to study the distribution of distinct immune cell
populations in these areas of inflammation. Thus, we fluorescently
tagged the 19F nanoparticles for follow up in post fixation experi￾ments and employed the same in vivo 19F/1
H MR protocol as above.
The 19F nanoparticles were tagged with DiI as fluorescent marker but
the 19F content (5 mmoles PFCE per injection) and size (Z-Average
Diam. 5 170 nm) was kept constant. Following visualization of 19F
signal by 19F/1
H MRI, we extracted CNS and performed immuno￾histological staining for macrophages and lymphocytes in CNS
regions where the 19F signal was predominant, specifically cerebel￾lum (Figure 6B). We observed a main co-localization of DiI-labeled 19F nanoparticles with F4-801 and Mac-21cells, indicating that the 19F–DiI nanoparticles are primarily taken up by macrophage-like
cells from the periphery into the CNS. However we also observed a
co-localization of 19F–DiI with CD41 T cells in the cerebellum
(Figure 6B). We also performed FACS of the CNS tissue and sec￾ondary lymphoid organs. As expected, we observed a large percent￾age of CD31 T cells, CD191 B cells as well as CD11c1 and CD11b1
myeloid cells in the CNS; most of the latter CD11c1 and CD11b1
cells were sequestered from the draining lymph nodes
(Supplementary Figure 2 left panel: no DiI-labeled 19F nanoparti￾cles). Also with FACS, we observed that CD11c1 (30%) and CD11b1
(42%) myeloid cells are the predominant immune cells types that
transport the 19F–DiI nanoparticles in the CNS (Supplementary
Figure 2, right panel: DiI-labeled 19F nanoparticles). Interestingly,
CD31 T cells and CD191 B cells, although present in large quantities,
take up a small amount of the 19F–DiI nanoparticles in the CNS and
therefore do not contribute significantly to the 19F MR signal we
observe in the CNS in vivo. In contrast 7% of CD31 T cells and
41% of CD191 B cells were labeled with 19F–DiI nanoparticles in
the draining lymph nodes and therefore appear to contribute to
the 19F MR signal we observed in the lymph nodes in vivo. More
detailed ex vivo and in vivo longitudinal studies will help further
identify the rich dynamics of the different immune cell populations
that serve as communicating envoys between immune system and
CNS during encephalomyelitis.
Discussion
The main motivation for constructing the dual-tunable 19F/1
H RF
birdcage probe for brain imaging was to increase the sensitivity
required to non-invasively follow immune cells in the CNS during
inflammation with MRI. The potential applications for 19F in MRI
and MR spectroscopy (MRS) have long been recognized15,16. The
possibility of employing 19F MRI for tracking cells in vivo was how￾ever first implemented in the last decade. At present, nanoparticles
rich in 19F atoms are employed to study immune cell or stem cell
migration in vivo with the help of 19F/1
H MRI17–22. However, major
challenges particularly signal sensitivity constraints exist. In the pre￾sent study we prepared nanoparticles (160–170 nm range) from
perfluoro-15-crown-5-ether (PFCE) and labeled them with a fluor￾escent dye (DiI) prior to systemic administration in EAE mice.
Thereafter we followed the uptake of the particles by immune cells
during the course of the CNS inflammation using the constructed
dual-tunable 19F/1
H birdcage RF head probe.
The geometry chosen for the present 19F/1
H RF probe was very
favorable to boost transmission field homogeneity (Bz
1 ). Indeed, we
showed very encouraging results for mouse neuroimaging. One of
the benefits of the highly homogenous transmission field was the
significant signal improvement in ventral regions of the CNS, par￾ticularly in the brain stem and spinal cord, as well as the draining
lymph nodes. These areas are otherwise not easily accessible by con￾ventional commercially-available RF head probes (such as small sur￾face coils or phased-array coils) due to depth penetration constraints.
The high degree of cylindrical symmetry as well as the absence of
chip capacitors also prevented the manifestation of susceptibility
artifacts23. The elimination of chip capacitors – as improvement to
the original birdcage probe designs – was introduced with the
millipede probes10. One main advantage of the present 32-leg bird￾cage probe over the millipede probe is the lower number of legs
required due to the shingled design, which makes multiple tuning
possible. With the constructed RF probe we achieved a uniform Bz
1
field almost identical for both 19F and 1
H channels (3.5% difference in
the maximum B1
1 between both channels in favor of the 19F-chan￾nel). The simulations of the 1
H channel for the 19F/1
H dual-tunable
resonator were similar to the ones for a single-tuned 1
H linear bird￾cage resonator with the same dimension. The homogeneous field was
indispensable to perform spin echo imaging that is sensitive to
changes in power and fluctuations in the Bz
1 field13,14.
From an RF engineering point of view, the quality of the con￾structed birdcage probe showed a SNR gain with respect to other
coil designs with larger diameters and fewer legs, including those for
19F/1
H mouse body imaging (32 mm diameter, 16 legs)21 in our lab.
The electrical measurements – specifically S Parameters – give a
quantitative assessment of the quality of the probe. Probes with a
highffiffiffiffi Q Factor have an improved SNR, considering that SNR!
Qp 9,24. The Q Factor for the unloaded probe (QU) was measured
to be 130 and when loaded (QL) it was 80 – 110. It should be noted
that QU decreases with increasing number of legs in a birdcage
probe25. The Qratio (QL=QU) gives an indication of the noise dom￾inance, whether it is from the sample or the probe. It should be ideally
smaller than 0.5 in order to achieve predominantly sample noise.
However, small probes usually have an increased Qratio since size is
inversely proportional to inductance (L) and directly proportional to
resistance (R), according to the formula Q~ w0
: ð Þ L =R (v0 5 res￾onance frequency)26,27. The Qratio for the constructed 32 leg probe
was calculated to be 0.6 – 0.8. Since the noise contribution for our
birdcage probe is predominantly probe dependent (Qratio . 0.5), it
was imperative to minimize dielectric losses and coil resistance by
using low loss PCB material. Furthermore the design of our birdcage
probe – in which plate capacitors were built into its structure –
reduced resistance by minimizing the soldering connections required
for assembling chip capacitors; added soldering also significantly
increases resistive losses in small birdcages25.
The similarity between 19F and 1
H NMR properties is an advantage
since the same pulse power settings can be used for both nuclei. After
power calibration and adjustments for the 1
H channel, the same
settings can be applied for the 19F channel. For our birdcage probe
we altered the overlapping areas between the copper legs to achieve
both frequencies. To fine tune to the 1
H (400 MHz) and 19F
(376 MHz) frequencies the reflection coefficient for both frequencies
needed to be tweaked by altering the distance of the RF shield to the
probe. We used a shield diameter of 48 mm to achieve the best
results. According to a previous study investigating the shielding
effect on field homogeneity, the ratio between diametershield and
diametercoil should be between 2 and 3; if the shield is closer (ratio
, 2) the RF field is disrupted26. For the present setup the ratio
between diametershield and diametercoilwas 2.4 for the measurements
and final simulations. Indeed the Bz
1 field distributions were homo￾genous across the cross section of the phantom for both simulations
and measurements. The deviation of the measured Bz
1 field over the
center slice was calculated to be in the range of 6 – 7%, which made
this birdcage particularly suitable for 3D fast spin-echo sequences
such as RARE since these are more susceptible to Bz
1 field in homo￾geneities than gradient echo sequences. A variation in flip angle of
less than 10% has no significant influence on spin echo sequences13,14.
A recognized limitation with our coil design is that the birdcage
cannot be driven in quadrature and dual-tunable mode at the same
time. Compared to a linear driven birdcage, a quadrature driven coil
would add another 41% to SNR gain or reduce the acquisition time to
50% at no cost to SNR. Due to the small size of the coil and space
constraints, it is not possible for us (at the current stage) to construct
the birdcage in dual-tunable and quadrature driven mode, as has
www.nature.com/scientificreports
SCIENTIFIC REPORTS | 3 : 1280 | DOI: 10.1038/srep01280 7

been shown for human application28. Another problem with the
quadrature driven mode is the decoupling of the two channels.
Potential improvements are to make each channel dual-resonant29
or to make use of alternate-tuned birdcage elements11. Since the
proposed design exploits the similarity of proton and fluorine nuclei
it might not be possible to apply this technology to low-gamma
nuclei.
By using fluorescently-labeled 19F-rich particles we could selec￾tively detect inflammatory cells with 19F/1
H MRI and then identify
the cell types with the help of fluorescent methods, namely confocal
microscopy and flow cytometry. Although the spatial resolution for
19F/1
H MRI (mm-range) is not comparable with the high resolution
that can be achieved with microscopy (nm-range), it is still possible
to study the nature of immune cell infiltration with this technique.
Furthermore these experiments can also be done in vivo and over a
longer period of time; due to the non-invasiveness of the technique it
is possible to monitor the migration of immune cells for several days
without the necessity of sacrificing the mouse after investigation.
From our study, we could conclude that CD11c1 and CD11b1
myeloid cells are sequestered from the draining lymph nodes (LN)
during early stages of the disease to enter the CNS, predominantly
into cerebellum, brain stem and also cerebral cortex. The initial 19F
signals detected in vivo were mostly located within draining LN;
typically the submandibular LN, superficial and deeper cervical
LN, facial LN and internal jugular LN. These results further support
the significance of the lymphatic system for initiation of CNS inflam￾mation. While the role of the draining lymphatic system on priming
immune cells to target the CNS has long been known30, the kinetics of
lymphatic drainage in and out of the CNS is still unclear. In this study
we start to uncover some of these dynamics between immune system
and CNS with the help of 19F/1
H MRI. Further elaborate studies need
to be undertaken to study the movement of immune cells into the
CNS during encephalomyelitis. While it is appealing to employ
19F/1
H MRI to study the impact of the immune system on the
development of CNS injury during autoimmune encephalomyelitis,
it would be also very interesting to employ 19F/1
H MRI to study the
impact of neuronal damage or degeneration on the outcome of
lymphatic drainage. Recently, light has been shed upon the route
taken – namely the cribriform plate– by myeloid cells from the site
of neuronal injury to the draining cervical LN31. These results favor
the application of in vivo non-invasive approaches such as 19F/1
H
MRI to monitor the trafficking of immune cells real-time after trau￾matic injury32.
In summary, we developed a birdcage RF probe for 19F/1
H neu￾roimaging with a design that promotes signal to noise ratio, a sym￾metrical cylindrical geometry, a high filling factor and a
homogeneous Bz
1 -transmit field. The first in vivo experiments per￾formed in EAE mice using 19F/1
H MRI are promising in that we are in
a position to non-invasively follow the kinetics of inflammation
specifically due to the near-to-complete absence of 19F in living tissue.
Further experiments with 19F/1
H MRI in autoimmune encephalo￾myelitis and also neurodegenerative disorders are warranted to fur￾ther understand the communication channels between CNS and the
immune system.
Methods
Electromagnetic field simulations and probe design. Prior to construction, various
probe designs were simulated with Microwave Studio (MWS) (CST, Darmstadt;
Germany) and Penn State Birdcage Builder (BB)33. After analysis of the EMF
simulation results, a 32-leg low pass (LP) probe design was chosen. The details and
dimensions for the simulation were chosen as close as possible to the desired birdcage
size: diameter 5 18.4 mm, total length 5 39 mm, leg width 5 1 mm, leg length 5
33 mm, end ring width5 3 mm, RF shield diameter 5 58 mm. Since the capacitance
values required for the construction estimated from Birdcage Builder were very small
(e.g. for 1
H (400 MHz) C 5 1.17 pF), it was not possible to design such a birdcage
using chip capacitors. Thus we chose to build the capacitors into the structure of the
RF probe by preparing copper strips milled on either side of a double sided copper
clad PCB (printed circuit-board) with an area of overlap in between. Figure 1A shows
a sketch of the 32-leg 19F/1
H LP birdcage design, which was then simulated in MWS.
On each side of the PCB, copper strips were arranged in a way to overlap only a few
mm depending on the capacitance and thus frequency required. The long inner
copper strips (shown in black) overlap with the outer peripheral copper strips (shown
in white) that are connected together by the end rings. We first calculated the overlap
required to achieve a basic birdcage frequency (birdcage mode) of 388 MHz
(frequency midway between the 19F and 1
H frequency). According to the Birdcage
Builder this basic frequency necessitates a capacitance of 1.38 pF. To calculate the
area of overlap between the strips required in order to achieve the necessary
capacitance (C), we used the formula for plate capacitors:
C~e0
:
er
:
A=d
where e0 5 vacuum permittivity constant (8.85418*10212 F/m), A 5 area of overlap,
d 5 thickness of the PCB that corresponds to the distance between the overlapping
strips. For the ensuing probe construction we opted for a special flexible PCB with a
high relative permittivity (er < 10) and a thickness of 400 mm. Using these values, a
capacitance of 0.22 pF is achieved per mm2 overlap. For the basic frequency of
388 MHz (1.38 pF), we calculated an overlapping area of 6.27 mm2 and applied this
for 28 strips. We then degenerated the basic frequency mode symmetrically to achieve
the desired 1
H and 19F modes. For the 1
H mode, 2 strips were overlapped by an area of
3.14 mm2 to tune to 400 MHz and for the 19F mode, 2 strips were overlapped by an
area of 9.39 mm2 to tune to 376 MHz. Figure 1B shows a circuit diagram displaying
the distribution of all capacitors built into the structure of the RF probe and the
corresponding ports.
To construct the 32-leg LP head RF probe, we employed a CNC (computer
numerical control) machine Protomat S100 (LPKF, Garbsen, Germany) to mill the 32
copper strips on the PCB cladded with 18 mm copper on both sides (thickness 5
400 mm; Taconic CER-10). The PCB is made of low loss material (dissipation factor at
400 MHz tand 5 0.0025) and has a high permittivity (er < 10). Relying on the
simulations and calculations, 28 strips were overlapped by 6.27 mm2 to achieve a
capacitance of 1.38 pF and therefore a basic frequency of 388 MHz. For the 1
H mode
(port 1, marked with * in Figure 1A) the overlap was reduced by 3.13 mm2 to
3.14 mm2 (C1 5 0.69pF) and for the 19F mode (port 2, marked with **) the overlap
was increased by 3.12 mm2 to 9.39 mm2 (C2 5 2.08 pF). For fine-tuning the shield
diameter was reduced stepwise from 58 mm to 48 mm. Furthermore for load￾dependent tuning (C1t and C2t) and matching (C1m and C2m) four small trimmer￾capacitors (1-10pF) were used. Figure 2A shows the constructed birdcage RF probe.
The dimensions of the RF probe are as follows: outer diameter 5 20.42 mm; inner
diameter of head probe 5 16 mm, total length 5 43.29 mm, width of each strip 5
1.11 mm, length of each leg 5 36.63 mm, width of end rings 5 3.33 mm, diameter of
RF shield (not shown) 5 48 mm. All parts for the housing of the 32-leg LP head RF
probe were designed using Autodesk Inventor 2011 (Autodesk Inc., San Rafael, CA,
USA) and built with a 3D Printer BST 1200es (Dimension Inc., Eden Prairie, MN,
USA). The RF performance of the head RF probe – including the measurement of the
full set of scattering parameters (S-parameter) that determine the reflection coeffi￾cients as well as coupling between the two ports (Figure 1D) – was tested with a
2channel vector network analyzer (Rhode & Schwarz GmbH & Co. KG, Memmingen,
Germany).
To block unwanted coaxial shield currents, we used baluns on each channel con￾nected as close as possible to the birdcage probe. The baluns were built from semi￾rigid cable (diameter 1.5 mm), bent into a loop with a radius of 7.5 mm and soldered
on a small piece of printed circuit board. Two 3 mm chip capacitors in the range of
2.2 pF–2.7 pF were used to tune the baluns to 376 MHz and 400 MHz.
Bz
1 simulations and measurements. For Bz
1 simulations we applied a 3D model
using MWS (Figure 2A) in which a 15-ml Falcon tube (conductivity: s 5 0.33 S/m,
relative permittivity: e 5 78) was used as phantom for loading the RF probe; we
simulated the load an average mouse head would add to the probe. The transmit￾active component (Bz
1 ) of RF probes can be measured by several flip-angle mapping
techniques34. For Bz
1 measurements, the probe was loaded with a 15 ml tube filled
with saline solution doped with CuSO4 (0.3 g/L) to decrease the T1 relaxation time to
c. 600 ms. This diminishes T1 related effects and thus reduces measurement time. For
the phantom measurements, we applied a time-consuming but simple and accurate
technique based on a set of rectangular non-selective preparation pulses (pulse length
5 1 ms) followed by spoiler gradients to destroy any transversal magnetization35.
This way a 3D distribution of longitudinal magnetization (Mz) was produced for the
whole volume of interest with 7 different power settings for the preparation pulses.
After each preparation step, the Mz-distribution of a central slice was mapped, using a
standard 2D gradient-echo sequence with a small flip-angle and long TR (TR min.
5*T1 5 3 s) to avoid T1-related effects: TR 5 3000 ms, TE 5 6 ms, slice thickness
1 mm, FOV 5 (15 3 15) mm2
, Matrix 64 3 64, NEX 5 1, 7 preparation pulses
(attenuators 5 150 dB, 56.4 dB, 44.4 dB, 39.5 dB, 36.4 dB, 32.3 dB, 31.3 dB), scan
time 5 35 min.
Preparation of 19F-rich DiI-labeled nanoparticles. For the ensuing in vivo 19F/1
H
MRI in EAE mice and post fixation experiments (histology and flow cytometry), we
prepared nanoparticles with high fluorine (19F) content and DiI fluorescence,
respectively. These particles consisted of 600 mM perfluoro-15-crown-5-ether
(PFCE, Fluorochem, Derbyshire, UK) and 630 mM 1,1’-Dioctadecyl-3,3,3’,3’-
Tetramethyl, indocarbocyanine Perchlorate (DiI, Molecular ProbesH, Invitrogen,
Darmstadt, Germany) and were prepared by first emulsifying PFCE in Pluronic F-68
(Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) via direct sonication, using a cell disrupting titanium
sonotrode (Bandelin Sonopuls GM70, Bandelin, Berlin, Germany) as previously
www.nature.com/scientificreports
SCIENTIFIC REPORTS | 3 : 1280 | DOI: 10.1038/srep01280 8

described21. After 151 (v/v) dilution with DPBS, the PFCE emulsion was further
sonicated in the presence of 630 mM DiI to obtain a PFCE-DiI nanoparticle emulsion
containing 600 mM PFCE. In order to remove free DiI, the PFCE-DiI nanoparticle
emulsion was then clarified on Sephadex G-50 (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) columns.
The average nanoparticle diameter was determined by dynamic light scattering using
a Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS instrument (Malvern Instruments, Worcestershire,
UK). The particle size remained constant after incorporation of the DiI.
In vitro experiments. To determine the uptake capacity for the prepared particles,
and optimize the 19F and DiI content, we labeled bone marrow derived dendritic cells
(BMDC) with the PFCE-DiI nanoparticles. BMDC were prepared from BM
suspensions as previously described36. Briefly, BM from femurs of C57BL/6 mice
were grown in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% FCS (Biochrom, Germany) and
supplemented with 100 ng/ml of GM-CSF.
In vivo experiments. Animal experiments were carried out in accordance to
guidelines provided and approved by the Animal Welfare Department of the State
Office of Health and Social Affairs Berlin (LAGeSo). For active EAE, female SJL/J mice
(Janvier SAS, Le Genest-St-Isle, France) were immunized subcutaneously with
250 mg PLP139–151 purity .95% (Pepceuticals Ltd., UK) together with Complete
Freund’s Adjuvant and heat-killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis (H37Ra, Difco).
Bordetella pertussis toxin (250 ng; List Biological Laboratories, US) was administered
intraperitoneally at days 0 and 2. On each day following immunization mice were
weighed and scored as follows: 0, no disease; 1, tail weakness and righting reflex
weakness; 2, paraparesis; 3, paraplegia; 4, paraplegia with forelimb weakness or
paralysis; 5, moribund or dead animal. Five days following EAE induction, mice were
administered with DiI-labeled nanoparticles containing 5 mmol PFCE.
For 19F/1
H MRI, EAE mice were anesthetized using a mixture of isofluraneas
inhalation narcosis (0.5–1.5%), pressurized air and oxygen shortly before and during
the MR session. The mice were positioned prone on the mouse holder of a small
animal MR scanner (Bruker Biospin USR 94/20, Bruker Biospin, Ettlingen, Germany)
with the head inside the 1
H/19F RF probe which was then moved to the isocenter of the
magnet. Following acquisition of scout images using 2D FLASH (MRI Software
Paravision 5.1, Bruker Biospin, Ettlingen, Germany), the RF head probe was tuned to
both 1
H and 19F resonance frequency and then matched to the characteristic
impedance (50 Ohm) using the tuning monitor of the animal MR scanner. Following
automatic system settings including 1st and 2nd order shimming to fine-tune the
homogeneity of the magnetic field, we employed a TurboRARE 3D sequence for 1
H:
TR 5 1500 ms, TE 5 53 ms, FOV 5 (40 3 16 3 16) mm3
, Matrix 5 320 3 128 3
128, RARE Factor 5 16, NEX 5 1 (scan time ca. 25 min); for 19F: TR 5 1000 ms, TE
5 6 ms, FOV 5 (40 3 16 3 16) mm3
, Matrix 5 100 3 40 3 40, zero fill acceleration
2, RARE Factor 5 40, NEX 5 128 (scan time 5 45 min). For overview scans and
serving as a reference to the 19F MRS, we used a 2D FLASH protocol for 19F: TR 5
15 ms, TE 5 3.3 ms, one sagittol 3 mm slice, in-plane resolution (400 3 400) mm2
,
NEX 5 2048 (scan time 5 15 min) and for 1
H: TR 5 473 ms, TE 5 13 ms, 22 slices,
inplane resolution (73 3 73) mm2
, NEX 5 16 (scan time 5 25 min).
For quantification of the 19F content in specified regions of the mouse brain, we
employed single voxel spectroscopy (SVS), in particular Point RESolved Spectroscopy
(PRESS). For this purpose we placed a (3 3 3 3 3) mm3 voxel within the region of
interest (here cerebellum and cortex) of the mouse-brain (Figure 4). Then we
employed the FastMap37 method from Paravision, for volume specific magnetic field
(B0) shimming. After shimming the spectra where acquired using a PRESS-protocol
for 19F MRS: TR 5 1500 ms, TE 5 11.6 ms, voxelsize (3 3 3 3 3) mm3
, NEX512
(scan time 5 13 min). To quantify the 19F signal we acquired a 19F MRS calibration
curve using the same PRESS protocol with three 15 ml Falcon tubes containing
different concentrations of our PFCE Emulsion (10, 20 and 40 mM).
Post fixation experiments. For histological and immunohistochemistry
investigations, EAE mice were transcardially perfused with 20 ml cold PBS following
terminal anesthesia. Thereafter, perfusion was continued with 20 ml cold PFA (4% in
PBS). Brain, spinal cord and secondary lymphoid organs were then extracted and
subsequently post-fixed overnight in 4% PFA at 4uC. The tissue was then
cryoprotected with sucrose (30% in PBS) at 4uC, sectioned in 50 mm thick slices on a
cryostat at 220uC and processed on the same day. Free floating sections were washed
and incubated with antibodies against Mac2 (ACRIS GmbH, Herford, Germany),
CD4 (BD Pharmingen, Heidelberg, Germany), CD3 (Serotec, Du¨sseldorf, Germany),
F4-80 (Biolegend, Fell, Germany) and MPO (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) overnight at
4uC, thereafter washed in PBS and incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated
with Cy3 (Jackson, West Grove, Pennsylvania, USA) for 2 h at room temperature.
Some sections were incubated with FITC-conjugated B220 (Biolegend, Fell,
Germany). After antibody incubations, sections were mounted on standard glass
slides and covered with Vectashield-DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame,
California, USA) for fluorescence microscopy. Microphotographs were acquired
using a fluorescence microscope (BZ-9000, Keyence, Neu-Isenburg, Germany).
For flow cytometry (FACS) experiments, mice were transcardially perfused with
20 ml cold PBS following terminal anesthesia. After extraction, organs (brain, spinal
cord, lymph nodes, spleen) were mechanically dissociated through a 70 mm nylon cell
strainer (BD Falcon, Heidelberg, Germany) into RPMI medium (containing 5% FCS)
and centrifuged at 4uC. To remove contaminating erythrocytes from the dissociated
tissue, a lysis buffer was employed. For the CNS, cells were separated from myelin and
debris using a 37% Percoll gradient (1.125–1.135 g/ml; Sigma-Aldrich, Germany).
The resulting cells were incubated with anti-CD16/32 Fc-receptor block (BD
PharmingenTM, Heidelberg, Germany) for 15 min, washed in FACS buffer and pre￾pared for FACS surface staining with APC-conjugated CD3, FITC-conjugated CD19,
Pacific Blue-conjugated CD11b and APC-conjugated CD11c antibodies (eBioscience,
Frankfurt, Germany).
For electron microscopy, mice underwent terminal anesthesia and were transcar￾dially perfused with 4% formaldehyde and 0.5% glutaraldehyde prior to brain
extraction. A 3 mm3 cube (enclosing the PRESS-voxel used for spectroscopy) was
dissected from cerebellum and post-fixed (for 24 h in 2% gluteraldehyde, thereafter
for 4 h in 1% osmium tetroxide). Following dehydration, tissue was embedded in
Poly/Bed 812 (Polysciences, Eppelheim, Germany). Semithin sections were stained
with toluidine blue and ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate/lead
citrate. Sections were imaged using a FEI Morgagni electron microscope (FEI,
Eindhoven, NL) and the iTEM software (Olympus-SIS, Mu¨nster, Germany).
