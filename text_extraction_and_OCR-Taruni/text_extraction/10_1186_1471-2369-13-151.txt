Abstract
Background: Chronic renal disease is a serious complication of long-term intravenous drug use (IVDU). Recent
reports have postulated a changing pattern of underlying nephropathy over the last decades.
Methods: Retrospective investigation including all patients with prior or present IVDU that underwent renal biopsy
because of chronic kidney disease between 01.04.2002 and 31.03.2012 in the city of Frankfurt/Main, Germany.
Results: Twenty four patients with IVDU underwent renal biopsy because of progressive chronic kidney disease or
proteinuria. Renal AA-amyloidosis was the predominant cause of renal failure in 50% of patients.
Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (GN) was the second most common cause found in 21%. Patients with
AA-amyloidosis were more likely to be HIV infected (67 vs.17%; p=0.036) and tended to have a higher rate of
repeated systemic infections (92 vs. 50%; p=0.069). Patients with AA-amyloidosis presented with progressive renal
disease and nephrotic-range proteinuria but most patients had no peripheral edema or systemic hypertension.
Development of proteinuria preceded the decline of GFR for approximately 1–2 years.
Conclusions: AA-amyloidosis was the predominant cause of progressive renal disease in the last 10 years in
patients with IVDU. The highest rate of AA-amyloidosis observed was seen in HIV infected patients with IVDU. We
speculate that chronic HIV-infection as well as the associated immunosuppression might promote development of
AA-amyloidosis by increasing frequency and duration of infections acquired by IVDU.

Background
Renal disease related to intravenous drug use (IVDU)
has been reported since the 1970s, mostly in the con￾text of heroin-associated nephropathy, characterized by
nephritic syndrome and rapid-progression [1,2]. The
incidence of heroin associated-nephropathy decreased
in the last four decades. More recent reports starting
from the 1990s related chronic kidney disease in IVDU
more with concomitant chronic HIV-, HBV- and HCV￾infection [3-5]. Two recent studies from Europe
observed changing patterns of renal disease in patients
with IVDU, reporting an increased prevalence of renal
AA-amyloidosis [6,7].
Renal AA-amyloidosis is a complication of chronic
and/or recurrent inflammatory disease [8]. Autoimmune
diseases, mainly rheumatoid arthritis, are common causes
in resource rich countries whereas untreated chronic
infections are the predominant cause in countries with
limited medical resources. Severe proteinuria, nephrotic
syndrome as well as renal insufficiency are the typical clin￾ical manifestations of renal AA-amyloidosis [8]. Successful
treatment of the underlying inflammation, by immuno￾suppressant’s for autoimmune diseases or by antimicro￾bials for chronic infections, can lead to stabilization of
or even improvements of renal function [9].
Although cases of AA-amyloidosis in patients with
IVDU have already been described in the 1970s [10,11],
only sporadic cases have been reported in the last dec￾ades [5,12-14]. To date, it remains unclear to what

extent IVDU and associated co-morbidities, especially
chronic infections, contribute to the development of
renal AA-amyloidosis. Our aim was to describe the
histologic pattern of nephropathy and its associated risk
factors in a contemporary cohort of patients with
IVDU.
Methods
The Nephrology departments at Goethe-University (GU)
and the Agaplesion Markus Krankenhaus (AMK) are
two main nephrologic care providers and the only cen￾tres conducting renal biopsies in Frankfurt, Germany.
All patients with IVDU were identified by using the Pa￾tient Data management System of the renal units of the
GU and AMK that are based on primary and secondary
diagnosis according to the international Classification
of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10). We then retrospect￾ively analyzed all patients with ongoing or a prior his￾tory of IVDU referred to us between 01.04.2002 and
31.03.2012 that underwent renal biopsy because of
chronic kidney disease. Biopsies were performed because
of progressive renal failure or overt proteinuria. Clinical
data and the patient0s medical history were extracted
from the medical records. Glomerular filtration rate was
estimated (eGFR) using the Modification of Diet in
Renal Disease (MDRD) equation [15]. Proteinuria was
assessed by collection of 24-h urine at the time of renal
biopsy. Proteinuria prior to renal biopsy was determined
from spot urine. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) was
defined as initiation of chronic renal replacement ther￾apy (RRT) in an ambulatory setting. All data were col￾lected retrospectively; thus no informed consent or
approval from the ethics committee was obtained.
Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection was defined
by a detectable HBs antigen persisting at least 6 months.
Past HBV exposure was defined by detection of HBV
core or surface antibodies in absence of previous vaccin￾ation. Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection was
defined by detection of HCV antibodies and positive
HCV RNA PCR persisting at least 6 months. HIV infec￾tion was defined by positive HIV antibodies or positive
HIV RNA PCR.
All renal biopsy specimens were submitted for diag￾nostic purposes and proceeded using our standardized
routine protocol. Briefly, formalin-fixed and paraffin￾embedded kidney biopsy specimens were sectioned into
2 μm thick paraffin sections with at least 8 serial sec￾tions stained either by periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) or
hematoxylin-eosin (HE) stainings. Additionally, a Congo
red staining as well as immunohistochemical stainings
with antisera specific for IgA (1:150000), IgG (1:100000),
IgM (1:75000), C1q (1:75000) and C3c (1:75000, all poly￾clonal rabbit antisera, Dako Cytomation, Hamburg,
Germany) were performed of all cases. In Congo red
positive cases additional stainings with antibodies spe￾cific for the kappa (1:50000) and lambda (1:100000) light
chains (both polyclonal rabbit antisera, Dako) and for
amyloid A (1:500, monoclonal, mouse, clone mc-1,
Dako) for differentiation of the amyloid deposits were
initiated.
Continuous variables were expressed as median and
interquartile-range (IQR) or as proportions as appropri￾ate. Continuous and categorical variables were compared
for univariate analysis between groups using the t-test or
Mann–Whitney U-test and Fisher exact test, respect￾ively. All p-values reported are two-sided. Statistical sig￾nificance was assumed when the p-value was <0.05. A
statistical trend was assumed when the p-value was
>0.05 but <0.08. Kaplan-Meier (Mantel-Cox log-rank
test).estimates were used to analyze time to death or
progression to ESRD.
Results
Patients characteristics and renal findings on biopsy
Between 01.04.2002 and 31.03.2012 a total of 27 IVDU
patients were referred to our units because of chronic
kidney disease with either progressive renal failure or
large proteinuria. Renal biopsy was performed in 24
(88.9%) of these patients. A renal biopsy was not per￾formed in one patient because of impaired coagulation
due to liver cirrhosis and two patients declined renal bi￾opsy. Patients were followed after renal biopsy for a cu￾mulative observation time of 59.5 patient-years (range 4
to 3540 days). All patients were Caucasians and mostly
male (62.5%). Self reported duration of IVDU was 3–
33 years and 12 patients (50%) had been, at least inter￾mittently, on opioid maintenance therapy. Chronic viral
infections were frequent: 21 patients (87.5%) had a
chronic HCV infection, 10 patients (41.7%) an HIV in￾fection and one (4.2%) had chronic HBV infection. Seven
patients (29.2%) had serologic findings indicating prior
HBV exposure.
Twelve patients (50%) had renal AA-amyloidosis and
five patients (20.8%) had a membranoproliferative glom￾erulonephritis type I. All other types of renal disease
were seen only in 1 or 2 patients (Table 1).
Clinical characteristics of patients with renal
AA-amyloidosis
All 12 patients with renal AA-amyloidosis presented
with elevated serum creatinine and nephrotic-range pro￾teinuria, but only 3 (25%) had signs of peripheral edema
in physical examination. Hypertension was uncommon
and found only in one patient (8.3%). Ultrasound exam￾ination revealed enlarged kidneys with increased echo￾genicity in all patients. All patients had a medical history
of chronic or repeated infections. Examination of
renal biopsies showed deposition of AA-amyloid in the

glomerula, the vessels and the interstitial compartment.
Tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis was present in
all patients ranging from 20 to 80% (representative
histological findings are presented in Figure 1). Two
patients had additional signs of acute interstitial
nephritis.
Time course of renal AA-amyloidosis
For 10 out of 12 patients with AA-amyloidosis we were
able to retrieve medical records on kidney function prior
to the time of renal biopsy. All patients showed a transi￾ent period of hyperfiltration followed by a rapid decline
of the eGFR within less than 2 years. Proteinuria pre￾ceded this eGFR decline a median of 20 months (range
13–36 months). Clinical course of renal AA-amyloidosis
prior to biopsy is demonstrated in Figure 2.
Two patients died within 1 year after diagnosis (one
because of sepsis, one of acute drug intoxication), and
five additional patients progressed to ESRD within less
than 2 years. Among those five patients with ESRD,
three patients died within 2 years after initiation of renal
replacement therapy (one because of sepsis, one of drug
intoxication, one by suicide). Among patients with other
causes of renal disease, 3 patients progressed to ESRD.
Outcome of patients with established diagnosis of renal
AA-amyloidosis is shown in Figure 3, demonstrating the
poorer outcome of these patients (p=0.0782).
Four surviving patients did not progress to ESRD
within more than 2 years after the diagnosis; all had
stopped IVDU after diagnosis of AA-amyloidosis and
were successfully treated with opioid maintenance
therapy.
Comparison of patients characteristics between those
with or without renal AA-amyloidosis
Both groups of patients were comparable for most
demographic and clinical characteristics (Table 2).
Amount of proteinuria was higher in patients with renal
AA-amyloidosis as compared to those with other types
of renal disease (p=0.021). HIV infection was signifi￾cantly more frequent in patients with AA-amyloidosis
than in those with other types of chronic renal disease
(67 vs. 17%; p=0.036). Patients with AA-amyloidosis
tended to have a longer self-reported duration of IVDU
(20.5 vs. 12.5 months; p=0.056) and a higher frequency
of chronic or repeated infections (92 vs 50%; p=0.069)
(Table 2). Of the eight patients with HIV infection and
renal AA-amyloidosis, three patients had previous
AIDS-defining events and four patients were previously
naïve to antiretroviral therapy at the time of renal biopsy
(in two the HIV infection was first diagnosed at the time
of renal biopsy).
Because of the significant relationship between HIV
and renal AA-amyloidosis in this cohort we compared
these data to those of 25 HIV-positive patients without a
prior history of IVDU that underwent renal biopsy
within the same time range, and found none of them
having renal AA-amyloidosis (data not shown).
Discussion
In this retrospective study we found renal AA￾amyloidosis to be the predominant cause of progressive
kidney disease in IVDU accounting for 50% of cases, fol￾lowed by membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis as
the second leading cause in 20.8%. This finding is well in
accordance with two recent observations from other
European Centres. These studies described an increasing
rate of renal AA-amyloidosis in IVDU, while in older bi￾opsy studies AA-amyloidosis was found only sporadic￾ally, indicating a changing pattern of nephropathy in this
patient population [5-7].
The occurrence of renal AA-amyloidosis in IVDU has
been linked to repeated bacterial infections, especially to
skin and soft tissue infections, endocarditis as well as
longer survival time after the onset of IVDU (as a conse￾quence of successful opoid maintenance therapy)
[6,7,10,11]. When comparing patients with renal AA￾amyloidosis to those without, we found a trend towards
a longer self-reported time of IVDU. Repeated infections
tended also to be more frequent in patients with AA￾amyloidosis. Yet, the low number of patients in our
series makes it difficult to establish a link between iso￾lated sites of infection and occurrence of AA-amyloid￾osis. Alternatively, it might be the case that not one

specific focus but the mere total number of bacterial
infections predisposes to the development of renal
amyloidosis.
The proportion of patients with HIV infection was sig￾nificantly higher in patients with renal AA-amyloidosis.
This observation has not been made in two published
studies on AA-amyloidosis in patients with IVDU. One
study did not provide data concerning HIV serostatus,
while the other found only one out of 20 patients to be
HIV infected [6,7]. However, this does not rule out a
higher rate of HIV infections in these studies, as in some
of our patients the HIV infection was just diagnosed be￾fore the renal biopsy was conducted. Several cases of
amyloidosis in HIV infected IVDU have been described
in the literature [5,6,13,14,16,17]. Besides IVDU, renal
amyloidosis in HIV infected patients has been described
in association with visceral leishmaniosis or multicentric
Castleman`s disease [18-21], which were both not found
in our cohort. During the same time period of this retro￾spective study, 25 HIV-infected patients without a

history of IVDU underwent renal biopsy at our institu￾tions and none of them had evidence of renal AA￾amyloidosis [data not shown]. Although these patients
cannot be properly matched, because of a higher median
age and 25% being of African-descent, this could indi￾cate that the HIV infection by itself does not predispose
for AA-amyloidosis, but coeval IVDU might increase the
risk. Indeed, in a recent study, we found IVDU to be an
independent risk factor for ESRD in an HIV-infected
population [22]. Moreover, another study demonstrated
that the combination of HIV infection and IVDU
increases the risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD) in
IVDU, with a higher prevalence of proteinuria in HIV￾infected compared to uninfected IVDU [23]. The major￾ity of HIV infected patients with renal AA-amyloidosis
had a poorly or uncontrolled HIV infection prompting a
severe immunosuppression and a chronic inflammation.
Thus the uncontrolled HIV infection might be an im￾portant direct and indirect factor for the development of
AA-amyloidosis predisposing to more frequent and se￾vere bacterial infections.
Although there are several case reports of AA￾amyloidosis in HIV infected IVDU, such a high rate has
not been previously described. What might explain this
finding? First, medical management of the IVDU popu￾lation is challenging, as patients often do not return for
follow-up and seek medical advice only when acutely ill.
Hence, renal biopsy is infrequently performed in IVDU.
Second, the time course of renal amyloidosis, its clinical
presentation with lack of peripheral edema or systemic
hypertension, and enlarged echogenic kidneys on ultra￾sound makes it indistinguishable from certain other
types of renal disease, especially HIV-associated nephro￾pathy (HIVAN) [3,17,24]. The diagnosis of HIVAN is
often established solely clinically and is often not con￾firmed by renal biopsy. Thus the true prevalence of renal
AA-amyloidosis might even be underestimated [25,26].
Third, development of AA-amyloidosis also depends on
predisposing genetic factors and is more frequent in
Caucasian compared to Black patients. Vice versa
HIVAN occurs mostly in Black patients and is a rarity in
Caucasians [27]. Thus different ethnic compositions of
IVDU cohorts may also contribute to the higher inci￾dence observed by us and other European centres when
compared to studies from the US with far higher rates of
black IVDU [6,7].
IVDU patients with AA-amyloidosis had a poor prog￾nosis, when compared to patients with other underlying
causes of AA-amyloidosis [6-8]. We and others found
that patients, who remained abstinent from IVDU after
the initial diagnosis, achieved stable or even improving
renal function during follow-up. This supports the idea
that removal of the recurrent inflammatory stimuli can
lead to at least some reversal of disease [6]. These
observations, underscore the importance of renal biop￾sies, especially in the light of the oligosymptomatic clin￾ical presentation of these patients. We found that overt
proteinuria preceded the GFR decline by approximately
1–2 years. But unfortunately urine analysis is often
missed by IVDU because unannounced illicit drug test￾ing with possible consequences for opioid maintenance
therapy is feared.
Besides the already discussed, our study has several
limitations. First, the population studied is small and
from a single metropolitan area. Thus, our results can￾not be generalized to other HIV, often ethnically highly
divers, cohorts. Second, IVDU often consume more than
one substance of varying, uncontrolled purity. Thus our
retrospective study cannot determine possible differ￾ences between substances used.
Conclusion
In conclusion we found AA-amyloidosis was the pre￾dominant cause of progressive renal disease in the
last 10 years in IVDU patients. The high incidence of
AA-amyloidosis observed was related to coeval HIV
infection. We speculate that the HIV mediated immuno￾suppression promotes development of AA-amyloidosis
by increasing frequency and severity of infectious com￾plications acquired by ongoing IVDU. Overt proteinuria
preceded the decline of GFR for approximately 1–2 years,
providing an opportunity for early intervention in an
otherwise fatal disease.
