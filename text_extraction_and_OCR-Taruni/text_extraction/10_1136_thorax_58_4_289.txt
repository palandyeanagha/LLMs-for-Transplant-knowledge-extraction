Abstract
Background: Pulmonary hypertension is a frequent complication of
severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and a major
cause of morbidity and mortality in this condition. Based on the
improved survival of these patients due to long term oxygen
therapy and the potent and selective pulmonary vasodilation by
inhaled nitric oxide, the safety and effectiveness of the combined
inhalation of these two gases over a 3 month period was assessed.
Methods: Forty patients with secondary pulmonary hypertension
due to COPD were randomly assigned to receive either oxygen
alone or “pulsed” inhalation of nitric oxide with oxygen over a
period of 3 months. “Pulsed” inhalation of nitric oxide was used to
reduce pulmonary ventilation-perfusion mismatch and formation of
toxic reaction products of nitric oxide and oxygen.
Results: Compared with oxygen alone, the combined inhalation of
nitric oxide and oxygen caused a significant decrease in mean (SE)
pulmonary artery pressure (from 27.6 (4.4) mm Hg to 20.6 (4.9)
mm Hg, p<0.001) and pulmonary vascular resistance index (from
569.7 (208.1) to 351.3 (159.9) dyne•s−1•cm−5•m−2, p<0.001)
without decreasing arterial oxygenation. Cardiac output increased
by 0.5 litres (from 5.6 (1.3) l/min to 6.1 (1.0) l/min, p=0.025).
Systemic haemodynamics and left heart function remained


unchanged during this period and no increase in toxic reaction
products of nitric oxide was observed.
Conclusions: This is the first controlled trial indicating that the
“pulsed” inhalation of nitric oxide together with oxygen may be
safely and effectively used for the long term treatment of severe
COPD.
