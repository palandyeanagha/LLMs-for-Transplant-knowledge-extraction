Background: Transient elastography (FibroScan) is a new, non-invasive, rapid, and reproducible method
allowing evaluation of liver fibrosis by measurement of liver stiffness. In cirrhotic patients, liver stiffness
measurements range from 12.5 to 75.5 kPa. However, the clinical relevance of these values is unknown.
The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the accuracy of liver stiffness measurement for the
detection of cirrhosis in patients with chronic liver disease.
Methods: A total of 711 patients with chronic liver disease were studied. Aetiologies of chronic liver
diseases were hepatitis C virus or hepatitis B virus infection, alcohol, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, other,
or a combination of the above aetiologies. Liver fibrosis was evaluated according to the METAVIR score.
Results: Stiffness was significantly correlated with fibrosis stage (r = 0.73, p,0.0001). Areas under the
receiver operating characteristic curve (95% confidence interval) were 0.80 (0.75–0.84) for patients with
significant fibrosis (F.2), 0.90 (0.86–0.93) for patients with severe fibrosis (F3), and 0.96 (0.94–0.98) for
patients with cirrhosis. Using a cut off value of 17.6 kPa, patients with cirrhosis were detected with a
positive predictive value and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 90%. Liver stiffness was significantly
correlated with clinical, biological, and morphological parameters of liver disease. With an NPV .90%,
the cut off values for the presence of oesophageal varices stage 2/3, cirrhosis Child-Pugh B or C, past
history of ascites, hepatocellular carcinoma, and oesophageal bleeding were 27.5, 37.5, 49.1, 53.7, and
62.7 kPa, respectively.
Conclusion: Transient elastography is a promising non-invasive method for detection of cirrhosis in
patients with chronic liver disease. Its use for the follow up and management of these patients could be of
great interest and should be evaluated further.
P
rogressive hepatic fibrosis with the development of
cirrhosis is a feature of almost all chronic liver diseases.
Approximately 10–20% of patients with chronic hepatitis
C virus infection have cirrhosis at first clinical presentation,
and as many 20–30% of those who do not have cirrhosis will
eventually develop this condition and its complications
within one or more decades.1–3 These complications are liver
failure, ascites, variceal bleeding, portal-systemic encephalo￾pathy, and hepatocellular carcinoma.3
Liver biopsy is currently considered the gold standard for
assessing hepatic fibrosis. However, it is an invasive and
painful procedure,4 with rare but potential life threatening
complications,5 limiting its acceptance and repetition in
usually asymptomatic patients. In addition, the accuracy of
liver biopsy in assessing fibrosis may be questioned because
of sampling error and interobserver variability, which may
lead to understaging of cirrhosis.6–9 Thus there is a need to
develop and validate non-invasive tests that can accurately
reflect the full spectrum of hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis, and its
severity in liver diseases.
Transient elastography (FibroScan; Echosens, Paris,
France) is a novel, rapid, and non-invasive technique which
measures liver stiffness.10 Briefly, this system is equipped
with a probe consisting of an ultrasonic transducer mounted
on the axis of a vibrator. A vibration of mild amplitude and
low frequency is transmitted from the vibrator to the tissue
by the transducer itself. This vibration induces an elastic
shear wave which propagates through the tissue. In the
meantime, pulse-echo ultrasonic acquisitions are performed
to follow the propagation of the shear wave and measure its
velocity, which is directly related to tissue stiffness (or elastic
modulus). The harder the tissue, the faster the shear wave
propagates. Recent reports have shown that liver stiffness
measurement using FibroScan allowed accurate prediction of
hepatic fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus
infection.11–14 In patients with chronic hepatitis C, we have
shown that liver stiffness measurements ranged from 2.4 to
75 kPa, with a median value of 7.4 kPa.14 Based on the
stiffness measurement distribution according to fibrosis stage
and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, we found
that the cut off value for cirrhosis was 12.5 kPa. However, the
clinical relevance of theses values (from 12.5 to 75 kPa) in
cirrhotic patients is unknown.
The aim of this prospective study was to assess the
accuracy of transient elastography for the detection of
cirrhosis in clinical practice in a large cohort of consecutive
patients with chronic liver disease.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients
Between June 2003 and September 2004, all consecutive
patients with chronic liver diseases seen at the Hepatology
Unit of Haut-Le´veˆque Hospital (University Hospital of
Bordeaux, Pessac, France) were prospectively included.
Determination of the aetiology of chronic liver disease was
made using standard diagnostic criteria. Hepatitis C virus
(HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV) was diagnosed by
serological detection of hepatitis C antibodies (with positive

serum HCV-RNA by polymerase chain reaction) and hepatitis
B surface antigen, respectively. Alcoholic liver disease was
diagnosed in those with consumption of at least 40 g of
alcohol daily for five years or more. All other diseases were
diagnosed as usual. The study protocol conformed to the
ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki.
Patients were enrolled after written informed consent was
obtained. All patients consented to the study.
Characteristics of patients
For all patients, the following parameters were determined at
the time of the liver stiffness measurement. Clinical param￾eters included weight, height, past history of ascites or
bleeding varices, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Biological
parameters included aspartate aminotransferase (AST),
alanine aminotransferase (ALT), c-glutamyl-transpeptidase,
total bilirubin, platelet count, prothrombin time, factor V,
albumin, and a fetoprotein. Morphological parameters
included oesophageal varices (after upper gastrointestinal
endoscopy) and ultrasonographic splenomegaly. As ascites is
a physical limitation to the technique because elastic waves
do not propagate through liquids, patients with ascites were
excluded.
Liver stiffness measurement
Details of the technical background and examination
procedure have been previously described.11 12
Measurements were performed on the right lobe of the liver
through intercostal spaces on patients lying in the dorsal
decubitus position with the right arm in maximal abduction.
The tip of the probe transducer was covered with coupling gel
and placed on the skin, between the rib bones at the level of
the right lobe of the liver. The operator, assisted by an
ultrasonic time-motion image, located a liver portion of at
least 6 cm thick free of large vascular structures. Once the
measurement area had been located, the operator pressed the
probe button to start an acquisition. Measurement depth was
between 25 mm and 65 mm below the skin surface.
Measurements which did not had a correct vibration shape
or a correct follow up of the vibration propagation were
automatically rejected by the software. Up to 10 successful
measurements were performed on each patient. Success rate
was calculated as the ratio of the number of successful
measurements over the total number of acquisitions. The
results are expressed in kilopascal (kPa). Median value of the
successful measurements was kept as representative of liver
stiffness. The whole examination duration was less than five
minutes. Only liver stiffness measurements obtained with at
least five successful measurements and a success rate of at
least 30% were considered reliable.
Liver histology and quantification of liver fibrosis
For patients who had liver biopsy at the time of the liver
stiffness measurement (usual indications for liver biopsy),
liver biopsy was fixed in formalin and paraffin embedded.
Liver stiffness measurements were performed just before liver
biopsy. All biopsy specimens were analysed independently by
an experienced pathologist blinded to the clinical data and
the results of the liver stiffness measurements.
Liver biopsies that contained less than 10 portal tracts
(except for cirrhosis) were excluded from the histological
analysis. The length of each liver biopsy specimen was also
established (in millimetres). Fibrosis was staged according to
the METAVIR scoring system as follows: no or mild fibrosis
(no fibrosis or portal fibrosis without septa, F0F1), moderate
fibrosis (portal fibrosis and few septa, F2), severe fibrosis
(numerous septa without cirrhosis, F3), and cirrhosis F4.15
Statistical analysis
The Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric analysis of variance was
used to compare liver stiffness among the different METAVIR
fibrosis stages. For fibrosis and complications of cirrhosis, the
diagnostic performance of liver stiffness measurement was
assessed using ROC curves. A subject was assessed as positive
or negative according to whether the non-invasive marker
value was greater than, less than, or equal to a given cut off
value. Associated with any cut off value was the probability
of a true positive (sensitivity) and the probability of a true
negative (specificity). The ROC curve is a plot of sensitivity
versus 12specificity for all possible cut off values. The most
commonly used index of accuracy is area under the ROC
curve (AUROC), values close to 1.0 indicating high diagnostic
accuracy. ROC curves were thus constructed for detection of
patients with METAVIR fibrosis stage 2 or more (F>2),

METAVIR fibrosis stage of 3 or more (F>3), and cirrhosis
(F = 4).
Spearman coefficients of correlation and their associated
probability (p) were used to evaluate the relationship
between parameters. As some data were missing for some
patients, the number of patients (n) included in the
calculation of each correlation coefficient was specified.
Optimal cut off values for liver stiffness were chosen to
optimise the predictive value according to the diagnostic
question. Statistical analyses were performed with NCSS
2004 software (Statistical Systems, Kayville, Utah, USA).
RESULTS
Patients
A total of 758 patients were enrolled. Forty seven patients
(6.2%) were excluded because of unsuccessful liver
stiffness measurement, mostly due to overweight (31
patients had less than five valid measurements and 16 had
a success rate lower than 30%). Thus 711 patients were
analysed. Their characteristics at the time of the FibroScan
examination are summarised in table 1. They were 403 males,
with a mean age of 52 (13) years. Aetiologies of chronic liver
diseases were: HCV (n = 398) or HBV infection (n = 43),
alcoholic liver disease (n = 89), HCV infection and alcoholic
liver disease (n = 26), HCV and human immunodeficiency
virus infection (n = 24), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
(n = 26), haemochromatosis (n = 17), cholestatic liver dis￾ease (n = 13), and other (n = 75).
A total of 354 patients (49.8%) had undergone liver biopsy
at the time of the liver stiffness measurement. Fibrosis stage
distribution was as follows: 111 patients (31.4%) had no or
mild fibrosis (F0F1), 99 patients (28.0%) had moderate
fibrosis (F2), 49 patients (13.8%) had severe fibrosis (F3),
and 95 patients (26.8%) had cirrhosis (F4). Median biopsy
length was 16.5 mm.
For cirrhotic patients, Child-Pugh score was A in 70
(73.7%) cases, B in 15 cases (15.8%), and C in 10 (10.5%)
cases.
Relationship between liver stiffness and histological
parameters
Liver stiffness measurements ranged from 2.4 to 75.4 kPa
(median 6.8). Mean number of measurements per patient
was 12.6 (4.1) (range 7–33). A total of 696 of 711 patients
had 10 valid measurements. The other patients had 5–9 valid
measurements. Therefore, the success rate was 84.7 (18.3)%
(range 30–100%).
Figure 1 shows box plots of liver stiffness for each fibrosis
stage. For patients with severe fibrosis (F3 and F4), median
liver stiffness was 18.7 kPa (range 3.3–75.4). For patients
with cirrhosis, median liver stiffness was 31.1 kPa (range
5.5–75.4). Liver stiffness was significantly different between
patients according to their fibrosis stage (p,0.001) and
significantly correlated with fibrosis stage (r = 0.73,
p,0.0001).
Figure 2 shows the diagnostic value (ROC curves) of liver
stiffness measurement for different degrees of fibrosis:
moderate fibrosis or more (F>F2), severe fibrosis or more
(F>F3), and cirrhosis (F = 4). Corresponding AUROC values
(95% confidence interval) were 0.80 (0.75–0.84) for F>F2,
0.90 (0.86–0.93) for F>F3, and 0.96 (0.94–0.98) for F = 4.
Based on the stiffness measurement distribution according to
fibrosis stage and ROC curves, the best discriminant cut off
levels were determined (positive predictive value of at least
90%). These cut off levels were 7.2 kPa for moderate fibrosis
or more, 12.5 kPa for severe fibrosis or more, and 17.6 kPa
for cirrhosis (table 2). Twenty of 95 cirrhotic patients (21%)
had liver stiffness measurements less than 17.6 kPa. For
patients with viral and alcohol related cirrhosis, median liver
stiffness values were 23 kPa and 52.4 kPa, respectively
(p,0.001).
Correlation between elastography measurement and
parameters of severity of cirrhosis
For all patients as well as for the subgroup of F3F4 patients,
as indicated in table 3, liver stiffness was significantly
(p,0.05) correlated with clinical parameters (past history
of bleeding varices, hepatocellular carcinoma, or ascites),
biological parameters (platelet count, prothrombin time,
factor V, albumin, and total bilirubin) and morphological

parameters (oesophageal varices stage 2/3, ultrasonographic
splenomegaly). In cirrhotic patients, liver stiffness was
significantly (p,0.0001) correlated with Child-Pugh score
(r = 0.517).
Diagnosis accuracy of liver stiffness measurement in
clinical practice
For patients with severe fibrosis or more (F>F3), AUROC
values for the performances of the liver stiffness measure￾ments in detecting complications of cirrhosis are given in
table 4. With a negative predictive value .90%, the cut off for
the presence of oesophageal varices stage 2/3 was 27.5 kPa,
for cirrhosis Child BC 37.5 kPa, for a past history of ascites
49.1 kPa, for hepatocellular carcinoma 53.7 kPa, and for
oesophageal bleeding 62.7 kPa (fig 3). According to these
negative predictive values, the usefulness of the liver stiffness
measurements with FibroScan in clinical practice is indicated
in fig 4.
DISCUSSION
The results of the present study conducted prospectively in a
large cohort of patients with chronic liver disease showed
that transient elastography is an efficient technique for the
diagnosis of cirrhosis and its severity. With a cut off value of
17.6 kPa, negative and positive predictive values for the
diagnosis of cirrhosis were 92% and 91%, respectively. We
established the cut off value for complications of cirrhosis,
with a negative predictive value of more than 90%. These cut
off values were 27.5 kPa for the presence of oesophageal
varices stage 2/3, 37.5 kPa for cirrhosis Child BC, 49.1 kPa for
a past history of ascites, 53.7 kPa for hepatocellular
carcinoma, and 62.7 kPa for oesophageal bleeding. In clinical
practice, such results could be of major relevance for follow
up of patients with severe fibrosis or cirrhosis.
In the present study, cut off values for the diagnosis of
fibrosis were slightly different from those previously pub￾lished.13 14 In published studies, for a diagnosis of fibrosis
>F2, cut off values ranged from 7.1 to 8.8 kPa.13 14 In our
study, this cut off was 7.2 kPa. For the diagnosis of fibrosis
>F3, cut off values ranged from 9.5 to 9.6 kPa.13 14 In our
study, this cut off was 12.5 kPa. Finally, for the diagnosis of
cirrhosis, cut off values ranged from 12.5 to 14.6 kPa.13 14 In
our study, the cut off for diagnosis of cirrhosis was 17.6 kPa.
These differences could be due to the study population which
comprised patients with chronic liver diseases of various
aetiologies. In the two previous studies, only patients with
chronic HCV infection were included. Secondly, in the two
previously published studies, cut off values were chosen to
maximise the sum of sensitivity and specificity whereas in
this study we chose cut off values to have a positive predictive
value of more than 90%, which favours specificity.
Cirrhotic patients with alcoholic liver disease had higher
liver stiffness values than cirrhotic patients with chronic
hepatitis C. Indeed, patients with chronic hepatitis C are
diagnosed at an early stage than alcoholic patients, with a
histological diagnosis without clinical complications of
cirrhosis. In contrast, patients with alcoholic disease are
diagnosed later, when clinical complications of cirrhosis
occur.
To our knowledge, this study is also the first to compare
liver stiffness measurement and fibrosis stage assessed on
liver biopsies in a large population of patients with chronic
liver disease of various aetiologies. The diagnostic perfor￾mances for F>F2, F>F3, and F = F4 obtained in these
different aetiological populations were similar to those
obtained in previously published studies conducted only in
HCV patients.13 14 In our study, the proportion of patients
with advanced fibrosis stages (F>3) was higher than in the

general population so diagnosis performance might be lower
in the general population. However, these results indicate
that liver stiffness measurement could be used to evaluate
liver fibrosis in chronic liver diseases, whatever the aetiology.
A liver biopsy was not performed in all patients. However, no
statistically significant difference was observed between the
characteristics of patients with or without liver biopsy.
Needle liver biopsy has been used as the ‘‘gold standard’’
for assessment of liver fibrosis. Usually, the diagnosis of
cirrhosis is based on a biopsy specimen that only represents
1/50 000 of the total liver mass.5 Furthermore, inter- and
intraobserver discrepancies of 10% to 20% in assessing
hepatic fibrosis have been reported, which may lead to
understaging of cirrhosis.7 15 Therefore, while liver biopsy
remains the ‘‘gold standard’’, both the clinician and
researcher should view the results with some reservations
and should interpret the findings in the broader clinical
context. Although the risks of liver biopsy can be reduced by
operator experience and using ultrasound guidance, several
known risks of obtaining the tissue, such as pain, bleeding,
pneumothorax, haemothorax, bile peritonitis, haemobilia,
puncture of the kidney and intestine, infections, anxiety, and
even death, do not seem to be entirely avoidable.4 5 16 17
Liver stiffness measurement using FibroScan is reproduci￾ble and independent of the operator12 and explores a volume
of liver parenchyma which can be approximated to a cylinder
of 1 cm in diameter and 4 cm in length. This volume is 100
times larger than the biopsy specimen volume and is thus
much more representative of the entire hepatic parenchyma.
Correlation of liver stiffness and fibrosis stage is not affected
by steatosis or activity grade.13
A variety of indirect markers of cirrhosis have been
evaluated, including variables such as the AST/ALT
ratio,16 18 19 platelet count,20 prothrombin index,21 APRI,22
and Fibrosure.23 All of these methods have been evaluated
in HCV patients. Our study showed that liver stiffness
measurement using transient elastography is a new non￾invasive method for the diagnosis of cirrhosis in either HCV
infected patients or in other patients with chronic liver
diseases. With FibroScan, AUROC for the diagnosis of
cirrhosis was 0.96. None of the other non-invasive methods
provide such an accurate value.
Ultrasonographic or radiological evaluation of the liver to
assess fibrosis has been limited to identification of indivi￾duals with cirrhosis and its complications. In a study of 243
patients, the diagnosis of cirrhosis could be made by
ultrasound with an accuracy of 82–88%.24 However, signifi￾cant interobserver variability and inability to gather all of the
required measurements, due to technical problems, limit the
value of ultrasonography. Using pulsed Doppler ultrasono￾graphy, Chawla and colleagues showed that there was a
significant decrease in portal flow velocity in patients with
Child’s C cirrhosis compared with controls and patients with
Child’s A and Child’s B cirrhosis.25 With liver stiffness
measurements using FibroScan, there is no intra- or
interobserver variability and the technique is reproducible.12
With only five successful acquisitions and a 30% success rate,
the result of liver stiffness measurements correlated with
fibrosis stage.
Cirrhosis places the patient at risk of clinical complications,
such as portal hypertension, and variceal rupture is the
second cause of death in cirrhosis, justifying early screening
for oesophageal varices. The usual means of diagnosing
oesophageal varices is upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.
However, endoscopy can be considered invasive due to the
technique and level of discomfort. Non-invasive methods for
diagnosis need to be developed. In a study of cirrhotic
patients, diagnosis accuracy of oesophageal varices was 72%
with two variables: platelet count and prothrombin index.20
In another study, the positive predictive value of platelet
count for the presence of oesophageal varices was 67%.26 In
our study, 20 patients did not undergo endoscopy because of
refusal or because an endoscopy had been performed
1–2 years before the study. With a negative predictive value
of 95%, a liver stiffness measurement of .27.5 kPa was
associated with the presence of oesophageal varices stage 2 or
3, independently of the cause of cirrhosis. Thus a prospective
study in clinical practice should be done evaluating the
relevance of oesophageal varices screening in patients with
liver stiffness values of more than 27.5 kPa.
Maharaj et al, by performing three transcutaneous biopsies
in the same patients using different entry points, reported
that, in proven cirrhotic patients, a histopathological feature

of cirrhosis was present in all three biopsy specimens in only
50% of patients.6 Similarly, Abdi and colleagues27 performed
several post mortem biopsies and showed that the diagnosis
of cirrhosis could be obtained from one biopsy specimen in
only 16 of 20 cases. According to Bedossa et al, sampling
variation in liver fibrosis is a significant limitation in the
assessment of fibrosis with liver biopsy.8 Thus some cirrhotic
patients are misclassified as F3 patients. To determine the
usefulness of liver stiffness measurements with FibroScan in
clinical practice, to include all patients with cirrhosis, even
real cirrhotic patients with an incorrect F3 fibrosis at liver
biopsy examination, we evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of
liver stiffness for complications of cirrhosis in F3F4 patients.
In patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, ultrasonogra￾phy was performed before FibroScan in order to evaluate liver
stiffness in a part of the liver without hepatocellular
carcinoma. Therefore, tumour stiffness did not influence
the results of FibroScan. In this study, only a small number of
patients had hepatocellular carcinoma. Thus the role of
FibroScan in assessing the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma
needs further investigations. At last, in clinical practice (need
for surgery, medical treatments, etc) the risk of cirrhosis
decompensation could be excluded in patients with liver
stiffness measurements ,27 kPa (cut off value for Child A
stage).
In conclusion, liver stiffness measurement is a good
method for the diagnosis of fibrosis and cirrhosis, irrespective
of the cause of liver disease. Values in cirrhotic patients
ranged from 17.6 to 75.4 kPa. Liver stiffness measurement
may be accurate for assessing the severity of cirrhosis.
However, a longitudinal cohort study needs to be performed
to predict the complications of cirrhosis using FibroScan so
that screening for complications of cirrhosis, and close follow
up, could be performed.
