Abstract
Background: The Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is an easy to perform test from the white blood cell count. An
increase in NLR has been associated with vascular endpoints reflecting inflammation in atherosclerotic lesions.
Atherosclerosis is a global threat and vascular endpoints, like myocardial infarction or critical limb ischemia (CLI), are a
leading cause of death in industrialized countries. We therefore investigated NLR and its association with CLI and other
vascular endpoints in peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) patients.
Methods and Findings: We evaluated 2121 PAOD patients treated at our institution from 2005 to 2010. NLR was calculated
and the cohort was divided into tertiles according to the NLR. An optimal cut-off value for the continuous NLR was
calculated by applying a receiver operating curve analysis to discriminate between CLI and non-CLI. In our cohort
occurrence of CLI significantly increased with an increase in NLR. As an optimal cut-off a NLR of 3.95 was identified. Two
groups were categorized, one containing 1441 patients (NLR#3.95) and a second group with 680 patients (NLR.3.95). CLI
was more frequent in NLR.3.95 patients (330(48.5%)) compared to NLR#3.95 patients (350(24.3%)) (p,0.001), as were
prior myocardial infarction (48(7.0%) vs. 47(3.3%), p,0.001) and stroke (73(10.7) vs. 98(6.8%), p,0.001). Regarding other
inflammatory parameters, C-reactive protein (median 5.6 mg/l (2.3–19.1) vs. median 3 mg/l (1.5–5.5)) and fibrinogen
(median 412 mg/dl (345.5–507.5) vs. 344 mg/dl (308–403.5)) also significantly differed in the two patient groups (both
p,0.001). A NLR.3.95 was associated with an OR of 2.5 (95%CI 2.3–2.7) for CLI even after adjustment for other vascular risk
factors.
Conclusions: An increased NLR is significantly associated with patients at high risk for CLI and other vascular endpoints. The
NLR is an easy to perform test, which could be used to highlight patients at high risk for vascular endpoints.

Introduction
Peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) is frequent and
underdiagnosed [1]. If PAOD is not diagnosed in time and
treatment is not initiated immediately, the probability of disease
progression and development of critical limb ischemia (CLI) is
high [2]. CLI is an entity with a high mortality and high risk of
limb amputation. Although treatment options, including endovas￾cular treatment possibilities, improved in the last decades,
mortality and amputation rate are still high [3,4].
In one recently published study we showed that a high
CHA2DS2-VASc (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age$75
years (doubled), type 2 diabetes, previous stroke, transient ischemic
attack, or thromboembolism (doubled), vascular disease, age 65 to
75 years, and sex category) score was associated with a high risk for
CLI in PAOD patients [5]. Especially, type 2 diabetes and
advanced age were associated with an increase in CLI risk [5].
In general, the ankle brachial index (ABI) can be used to
distinguish CLI patients from non-CLI patients. However, the ABI
might be unreliable due to mediasclerosis. In case of mediasclerosis
the ABI does not reflect the perfusion in the extremity measured
and therefore makes discrimination of CLI patients difficult.
Especially in very old patients and patients suffering from diabetes
– the patients with the highest CLI risk - mediasclerosis is
frequently found [6].
Recently, the Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been
associated with a high mortality in CLI patients [7]. According to
recent publications the neutrophils included in this ratio reflect the
inflammatory response as they mediate inflammation by various
biochemical mechanisms, such as release of arachidonic acid
metabolites and platelet-aggravating factors [8]. Relative lympho￾penia on the other hand reflect the cortisol-induced stress response
[8]. In various studies the NLR correlates with markers of a
proinflammatory state and an elevated NLR is associated with an
increase in vascular endpoints and with a worse outcome after
oncologic surgery [9,10,11]. As data in PAOD patients are scarce
we conducted a study evaluating NLR and its value to

discriminate CLI patients from patients without CLI in PAOD
patients.
Methods
We included 2121 consecutive PAOD patients treated at our
department from 2005 to 2010 in our retrospective data analysis.
Inclusion criterion for our analysis was treatment at our institution
for PAOD during the time period described above. There was no
exclusion criterion in our study. The study was approved by the
ethics committee of the Medical University of Graz, Austria (EK
Number 24–506 ex 11/12). As this was a retrospective data
analysis of blinded data no written or verbal consent was obtained,
which was approved by the ethics committee.
The diagnosis and graduation of PAOD was assigned in our
outpatient clinic by means of clinical evaluation, ABI, and duplex
scan according to the TASC II criteria. Patients were successive
patients admitted to our outpatient clinic because of their PAOD
and afterwards scheduled for admission at our ward for further
treatment of their atherosclerotic disease. PAOD was graduated
using Fontaine classification, CLI was defined as PAOD patients
presenting with ischemic rest pain and/or skin ulceration/
gangrene in accordance to current guidelines reflecting patients
with Fontaine class 3 and 4 [12]. When patients were admitted to
the hospital, the medical records of the patients were analyzed by a
standardized questionnaire with attention to cardiovascular risk
factors and co-morbidities. Clinical symptoms were evaluated and
physical examination was performed. Blood was taken in fasting
patients and laboratory examinations were performed.
Statistical analyses
Clinical characteristics of subjects were analyzed using descrip￾tive statistics. For comparison of groups chi square test for
categorical values, t-test for normally distributed continuous
variables and Mann Whitney U test for non-normally distributed
continuous variables were used.
The study population was divided into tertiles according to their
continuous NLR. In order to reveal a statistical trend for NLR and
CLI a Jonckheere-Terpstra test was performed. The optimal cut￾off value for the continuous NLR was calculated by applying a
receiver operating curve analysis to test all possible cut-offs that
would discriminate between CLI and non-CLI.
We further calculated odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence
intervals (CI) for different CLI-risk factors with a binary logistic
regression model. All tests used a p-value of 0.05 as a threshold for
significance. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS
17.0.
Results
A total of 2121 PAOD patients were included in the current
analysis. Patients’ characteristics are shown in Table 1. In a first
step the study population was categorized according to the NLR
into three tertiles each containing 707 patients. In the first tertile
(median NLR 1.9, 1.6–2.2) the CLI rate was 20.9%, in the second
tertile (median NLR 3.1, 2.7–3.4) the CLI rate was 27.4%, and in
the third tertile (median NLR 5.4, 4.4–7.6) the CLI rate was

47.4% (Figure 1). In order to evaluate the trend for increase of
CLI rate for increasing NLR a Jonckheere-Terpstra test was
performed and showed statistical significance (p,0.001).
In a second step a NLR value of 3.95 was calculated by receiver
operating curve analysis as an optimal cut-off value to discriminate
between CLI and non-CLI. Consequently, we categorized our
cohort into two groups: one group with a NLR#3.95 containing
1441 patients and a second group with a NLR.3.95 containing
680 patients. The first group contained 350(24.3%) CLI patients
whereas the second group included 330(48.5%) patients with CLI.
The difference between groups was statistically significant
(p,0.001). Between the two NLR groups we found further
statistically significant differences in other vascular endpoints
(prior myocardial infarction (47(3.3%) vs. 48(7.0%), p,0.001) and
prior stroke (98(6.8%), vs. 73(10.7), p,0.001) and in inflammatory
parameters (CRP (median 3 mg/l (1.5–5.5) vs. 5.6 mg/l (2.3–19.1)
and fibrinogen (median 344 mg/dl (308–403.5) vs. 412 mg/dl
(345.5–507.5); both p,0.001) as well (Table 2). We also did
statistical analyses on the correlation of NLR with CRP and
fibrinogen. We calculated a Pearson correlation and a Spearman’s
rho as well for NLR.3.95 and CRP and for NLR.3.95 and
fibrinogen as well. For both parameters, we could confirm a
statistically highly significant correlation between the NLR and
CRP/fibrinogen (p-value of ,0.001; for NLR.3.95 and CRP:
Pearson’s r = 0.5; Spearman’s rho = 0.4; for NLR.3.95 and
fibrinogen: Pearson’s r = 0.4; Spearman’s rho = 0.4).
In a third step NLR.3.95 was used a variable in a binary
logistic regression model to evaluate this value as an independent
risk factor for CLI. In the model sex, type 2 diabetes, age.75,
coexistence of congestive heart failure, history of stroke/TIA and
the CHA2DS2-VASc Score were additionally included. Type 2
diabetes and age.75 were included as both variables showed a
close association with a coexisting CLI in a study published
recently from our group [5]. Even after adjustment for age.75,
type 2 diabetes, sex, coexistence of congestive heart failure, history
of stroke/TIA and the CHA2DS2-VASc Score NLR.3.95 was
associated with an OR of 2.5 (95%CI 2.3–2.7) for CLI (Table 3).
Discussion
In this study we were able to demonstrate that NLR.3.95 is
associated with a high risk for CLI in PAOD patients. Even after
adjustment for other main CLI risk factors like diabetes and
age.75years a NLR.3.95 was associated with a 2.5fold increase
in CLI risk. However, not only CLI was more frequent in the high
NLR group. Endpoints due to atherosclerotic lesions in other
vascular beds, like myocardial infarction and stroke, were also
more frequent in this group. Even entities associated with coronary
artery disease, like congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation
[13], were significantly more prevalent in the group with
NLR.3.95.
In general, leukocytes play an important role in the develop￾ment of atherosclerotic lesions, especially in the deposition of lipids
in the atherosclerotic plaques [7]. The NLR is derived from the
value of neutrophils and lymphocytes, two different parts of the
white blood count (WBC). From the pathophysiological point of
view the neutrophils mediate the inflammatory response by

mechanisms like release of arachidonic acid metabolites and
platelet activating factors, whereas a relative lymphopenia reflects
the cortisol induced response to stress [8]. Especially in CLI
lymphocytes seem to play an important role in the clinical course
of the disease. Iso et al. investigated the impact of implanted bone
marrow cell composition on limb salvage in patients with CLI
[14]. In this study lymphocytes were significantly elevated in the
limb salvage group [14]. One possible explanation for this finding
is the fact that lymphocytes might also be associated with the
mediation of collateral growth via IL-16 secretion as was shown in
a murine hindlimb ischemia model [15]. This might also be an
explanation for our findings, as patients with a high lymphocyte
count, leading to a lower NLR might have more collateral growth
leading to less ischemia and therefore less CLI.
In recent publications the NLR correlates well with other
inflammatory markers. This is also underlined by our findings, as
we were able to show from our data, that CRP and fibrinogen
differed significantly between the low NLR group and the high
NLR group. The association of NLR and CRP has been already
described for patients with cardiac disease and for patients with
oncologic surgery in the literature. In both studies an elevated
NLR was associated with a poor outcome [8,9]. Even in large
studies, like the Ludwigshafen Risk and Cardiovascular Health
(LURIC) study, NLR emerged as an independent predictor for
cardiovascular mortality [16].
In a recent study published by Turak et al. the authors showed
that an elevated NLR was associated with an increased risk for
coronary stent restenosis after bare metal stent insertion [17]. The
authors demonstrated that a NLR.2.73 had an 80% sensitivity
and a 75% specificity in predicting instent restenosis. The NLR
seems to reflect the active atherosclerotic disease in these patients
which leads to an elevated risk for restenosis after bare metal stent
insertion [17].
Similar to other studies conducted in this field our patients in
the high NLR group were significantly older than the patients in
the low NLR group. Whether age influences the NLR was to our
knowledge not investigated in the literature so far. However, the
association of an elevated NLR with CLI was still significant in our
patients even after adjustment for the factor age.75 years.
CLI is a limb threatening entity with a prevalence of 20 000
cases per year and an annual incidence of 40 per 100 000
population [2]. The prognosis of this condition has been improved
over the years mainly because of more awareness and better
treatment options. However death and amputation rate within one
year is still high (16.7% and 33.3%, respectively) [18]. The NLR
has been previously investigated by only one study in CLI patients.
In a study published by Spark et al. the authors were able to show
that an elevated NLR predicts mortality in CLI patients [7].
In clinical praxis it is often difficult to highlight PAOD patients
at high risk for CLI and those with a low CLI risk. The ABI, as
already lined out above, might be unreliable especially in very old
patients and patients suffering from diabetes due to mediasclerosis
[6].
In a recent study we showed that an elevated CHA2DS2-VASc
Score was associated with an elevated CLI risk [5]. By means of
this scoring system PAOD patients with a high CLI risk can be
discriminated from those with a low CLI risk. Especially diabetes
and age.75years, both factors associated with mediasclerosis in
the literature, were the two main entities associated with an
elevated CLI-increase [5]. In our current study we were able to
show that the NLR.3.95 was associated with an OR of 2.5 for
CLI, even after adjustment for these two main CLI risk factors.
Similar to diabetes and the age of the patients, which can both be
obtained from the medical history, the NLR is an easy available
test and can be calculated from the WBC count. The WBC count
is a laboratory test, which is usually performed on admission of
most patients.
The main drawback of our study is the retrospective study
design and that we used a single blood sample to calculate NLR. It
therefore remains unclear whether this single blood sample reflects
an elevated NLR over time.
However, we were able to show that NLR.3.95 can be used to
discriminate patients at high risk for CLI from those with a low
CLI-risk. Especially in combination with diabetes and the age of
the patients a discrimination of PAOD patients with high CLI risk
seems possible.
