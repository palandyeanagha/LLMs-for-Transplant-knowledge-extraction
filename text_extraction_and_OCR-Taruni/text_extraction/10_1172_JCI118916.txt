Abstract
We have identified a previously undescribed intrinsic car￾diac adrenergic (ICA) cell type in rodent and human heart.
Northern and Western blot analyses demonstrated that ICA
cell isolates contain mRNA and protein of enzymes in￾volved in catecholamine biosynthesis. Radioenzymatic cate￾cholamine assays also revealed that the catecholamine pro￾file of adult rat ICA cell isolates differed from that of
sympathetic neurons. Unlike sympathetic neuronal cells,
isolated ICA cells have abundant clear vesicles on electron
microscopy. Endogenous norepinephrine and epinephrine
constitutively released by ICA cells in vitro affect the spon￾taneous beating rate of neonatal rat cardiac myocytes in
culture. Finally, ICA cells could be identified in human fetal
hearts at a developmental stage before sympathetic innerva￾tion of the heart has been documented to occur. These find￾ings support the concept that these cells constitute an ICA
signaling system capable of participating in cardiac regula￾tion that appears to be independent of sympathetic innerva￾tion. (J. Clin. Invest. 1996. 98:1298–1303.) Key words:

Introduction
The importance of endogenous norepinephrine and epineph￾rine in augmenting cardiac function is well established. The
cardiovascular augmentation during the classic “fight or flight”
response is thought to be due primarily to catecholamine re￾lease from intracardiac sympathetic nerve endings and from
the adrenal medulla. However, a cardiac response to exercise
is not abolished in dogs that have undergone cardiac denerva￾tion and adrenalectomy (1). After cardiac denervation in dogs,
norepinephrine levels fall (, 5% of that in normal heart), re￾flecting the lack of sympathetic innervation, while a large frac￾tion (z 50% of that in normal heart) of tissue epinephrine
content remains in the heart (2). Patients with transplanted
hearts also maintain adequate cardiac function in the absence
of sympathetic reinnervation (3, 4). Furthermore, the obliga￾tory role of catecholamines in fetal cardiac development has
been underscored by the finding that mice with targeted dis￾ruption of catecholamine-synthesizing genes die in utero due
to cardiac failure at a developmental stage before cardiac sym￾pathetic innervation is known to occur (5, 6). Finally, recent
evidence suggests that abnormal cardiac epinephrine produc￾tion in heart failure patients may be derived in part from
sources other than adrenal chromaffin cells or sympathetic
nerves, because enhanced cardiac epinephrine spillover into
the coronary circulation is unrelated to stress-induced cardiac
sympathoadrenal activation (7). All these observations suggest
that an adrenergic mechanism distinct from the classic sym￾pathoadrenal axis may be involved in cardiovascular regula￾tion. This hypothesis prompted us to determine if an intrinsic
adrenergic system exists in the mammalian myocardium.
Methods
Morphologic studies
In situ and in vitro immunohistochemistry. Immunoperoxidase label￾ing (8) was performed with a monoclonal antibody (IgG) against ty￾rosine hydroxylase (TH)1
 (1:500, Incstar) on 3-mm paraffin sections
of 4% paraformaldehyde fixed rat and human hearts (two adult, two
neonatal, and two fetal human hearts). Nonspecific IgG served as a
control. Antibodies (IgG) against neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and
protein gene product 9.5 were also used at 1:5,000 dilution. Isolated
intrinsic cardiac adrenergic (ICA) cells (see below) from adult rat
hearts were stained using an alkaline phosphatase immunohis￾tochemical method (9). Antibodies against TH and NSE were used at
1:50 and 1:100 dilution, respectively. Isolated myocytes served as a
negative control for anti-TH and anti-NSE in ICA cells. The use of
human discarded tissue was approved by Human Research Commit￾tee of Brigham and Women’s Hospital.
Electron microscopic analysis. Transmission electron microscopic
analysis was performed on primary isolates of adult rat and human
ICA cells. Human ICA cells were isolated from specimens obtained
at surgery (two hearts). Ventricular tissues were enzymatically disso￾ciated, and human ICA cells were isolated in the same manner as for
the rat. Isolated ICA cells were fixed in 1.5–4% glutaraldehyde for
electron microscopy using routine methods.

Cardiac myocyte and ICA cell isolation
Enzymatic dissociation of ventricular myocytes was performed as de￾scribed previously (10). The isolation of ICA cells was made possible
by the observation that ICA cells associated with magnetic beads af￾ter enzymatic dissociation of cardiac muscle tissue. Dissociated muscle
cells were resuspended in 4 ml of phosphate-buffered saline contain￾ing 50 ml of IgG-free magnetic beads (8-4100B; Advanced Magnetics,
Inc., Cambridge, MA) and incubated for 20 min with intermittent
mixing on ice. ICA cells associated with the beads were recovered by
magnetic separation (Dynal, Inc., Great Neck, NY). Isolated ICA
cells were used for immunohistochemical staining as described above
and for further biochemical assays.

neurons, and ventricular myocytes depleted of ICA cells in adult rats.
Catecholamine content was quantitated with a catechol-O-meth￾yltransferase–based radioenzymatic method (11). Rats were anesthe￾tized and stellate ganglia were isolated. All cells were homogenized in
a lysis buffer containing 1% Triton, 5 M NaCl, 1 M Tris, 0.5 M
EDTA, 0.25 M EGTA, 20 mM phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride, 0.2
mM sodium orthovanadate, and 0.5% NP-40. Cell lysates were centri￾fuged for 20 min at 5,800 g and the supernatants were used for cate￾cholamine assays. For whole heart catecholamine assays, isolated
hearts were perfused with Tyrode’s solution (378C) for 20 min to
eliminate catecholamines in blood. Hearts were homogenized by a
tissue homogenizer in 5 ml of lysis buffer, and the supernatants were
collected.
Catecholamine release in vitro. Freshly isolated rat ICA cells
were plated in a P-60 culture dish containing 3 ml of serum-free cul￾ture medium (DMEM; GIBCO-BRL, Gaithersburg, MD) with 1 mM
Ca21 incubated for 1 h (378C, 5% CO2), and conditioned media were
taken for radioenzymatic catecholamine assay. ICA cells from each
dish were then lysed for protein quantification.
ICA cell catecholamine release and neonatal myocyte beating 
rate in vitro
Neonatal rat ventricular cardiac cell cultures were prepared using es￾tablished methods (12). ICA cells which are present in neonatal rat
ventricular myocardium were not selectively removed from neonatal
rat ventricular myocyte primary isolates using the magnetic cell isola￾tion method described above. This allowed the observation of ICA
cell–derived catecholamines on neonatal rat myocyte contractile
function in vitro. The beating rate of myocytes plated on a coverslip
was determined on a temperature-controlled (378C) chamber on the
stage of a microscope connected to a videomotion analyzer (10). The
spontaneous beating of myocyte clusters converted to an analogue
signal was recorded continuously by a pen recorder. The culture was
allowed to equilibrate in Tyrode perfusate (2 ml/min) for 20 min be￾fore the b-adrenergic antagonist timolol (1 mM) was administered (n 5 5
preparations). All data are expressed as mean6SEM. ANOVA and a
Student’s t test were used for statistical analyses.
Northern and Western blot analyses
Total RNA isolated from each cell type was electrophoretically re￾solved on 1% formaldehyde-agarose gels (13). Blots were hybridized
overnight with a randomly primed 2.3-kb human genomic TH probe
(American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) at 428C. The
blot was washed for 30 min at 658C in 23 SSC, 0.5% SDS followed by
two additional 15-min washes in 0.13 SSC before autoradiography.
For Western blots, cell lysates were prepared in a buffer as described
above. Lysates were separated by 4–20% SDS-PAGE and then elec￾trophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (14). The pri￾mary antiserum dilutions for anti-TH, anti–dopamine b-hydroxylase
(DBH), and anti–phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT)
(Incstar) were 1:6,000, 1:6,000, and 1:10,000, respectively. Sympa￾thetic neurons taken from adult rat stellate ganglia were studied after
3 d in culture using a method described previously (15).
Results
Histological identification of ICA cells. Immunoreactivity for the
rate-limiting catecholamine-forming enzyme TH was noted in
a class of cardiac cells not associated with neurites or efferent
sympathetic axons in adult and neonatal rat hearts. These cells,
which we have termed ICA cells, formed clusters and were dif￾fusely distributed throughout the heart including both atria
and ventricles. ICA cells were closely associated with the coro￾nary microvasculature (arterioles, venules, and capillaries) and
were also in intimate contact with atrial and ventricular myo￾cytes in adult rat heart (Fig. 1). TH colocalized with a common
neuroendocrine/neuronal marker, NSE (16), in adult rat
hearts (Fig. 1), as well as another neuroendocrine maker, pro￾tein gene product 9.5 (17) (data not shown). Importantly, ICA
cells were also observed in early gestational human fetal
hearts, primarily in a perivascular and intramyocardial distri￾bution (Fig. 2). Although sympathetic axons, which were
stained positively with anti-TH, were readily observed in adult
and neonatal rat heart sections, such structures were not visu￾alized in sections of human fetal hearts at 20 wk of gestation, a
stage of development that precedes innervation of the heart by
the sympathetic nervous system (18).
Isolated ICA cells in vitro retained their characteristic in
situ adrenergic immunohistochemical profiles (Fig. 1, e–h).
Electron microscopic examination of primary isolates of ICA
cells revealed a single cell population with distinct ultrastruc￾tural features that were similar in rat and human hearts (Fig.
3). Importantly, neither cells nor cellular remnants containing
dense core granules suggestive of chromaffin cells or sympa￾thetic nerve endings were observed in ICA cell isolates (Fig. 3).
ICA cell catecholamine content and release in vitro. The con￾tent of norepinephrine and epinephrine in ICA cells was com￾parable with that of rat sympathetic neurons isolated from stel￾late ganglia after normalization for total cell protein. However,
the dopamine content was lower in ICA cells than in sympa￾thetic neurons (Table I). Adult rat ventricular myocyte pri￾mary isolates, from which ICA cells had been selectively re￾moved, did not exhibit detectable dopamine and epinephrine,
although a small amount of norepinephrine (z 1% of that

present in ICA cells) could be detected, presumably due to re￾sidual contamination by ICA cells. Based on the catechol￾amine content of ICA cell isolates isolated from whole adult
rat hearts, we estimate that catecholamines derived from ICA
cells constituted at least 18, 13, and 16%, respectively (Table
I), of total rat heart content of epinephrine, norepinephrine,
and dopamine. Release of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and
dopamine from adult ICA cell primary isolates in vitro was
0.860.3, 6.061.1, and 1.360.3 pmol/h/mg cell protein, respec￾tively (Fig. 4 A).

To determine whether the basal beating rate of neonatal
rat ventricular myocytes in culture was dependent upon cate￾cholamine release by neonatal ICA cells in myocyte culture,
the b-adrenoreceptor antagonist timolol (1 mM) was used. The
spontaneous beating rate of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes
was reduced by 5868% by timolol in five culture preparations
that contained both neonatal myocytes and ICA cells.
Catecholamine-synthesizing mRNA and proteins in ICA
cells. Messenger RNA and protein for TH (19, 20) were de￾tected in primary isolates of ICA cells (Fig. 5 B). TH protein
was identified by Western blot in ICA cells isolated from adult
rat hearts (Fig. 5 C) and an adult human heart (data not
shown). In addition to TH, DBH (Fig. 5 D) and PNMT pro￾teins, which catalyze the formation of norepinephrine and epi￾nephrine, were identified as well in ICA cell primary isolates
(Fig. 5 E).
Discussion
This study identified a previously undescribed type of cardiac
cell capable of adrenergic paracrine signaling in mammalian
hearts. These cells, which do not have neuronal or chromaffin
cell ultrastructural morphology on electron microscopic analy￾sis, we have termed ICA cells. Isolated ICA cells in vitro re￾tained their characteristic in situ adrenergic immunohis￾tochemical profiles (Fig. 1, e–h). ICA cells exhibited numerous
clear vesicles and an extensive exocytotic profile suggestive of
a secretory phenotype (Fig. 3). The presence of clear cytoplas￾mic vesicles distinguishes ICA cells from cardiac chromaffin
cells, which contain electron-dense core granules and are
largely confined to atrial parasympathetic ganglia (18, 21, 22).
ICA cells were also identified in human fetal myocardium.
That no sympathetic axons were visualized in fetal hearts of 20
wk of gestation is consistent with a report of their absence de￾termined by ultrastructural analyses of early gestational age
human hearts (18). These data suggest that ICA cells are
present within the developing myocardium before the initia￾tion of sympathetic innervation. The obligatory role of cate￾cholamines in fetal development has been underscored by the
finding that in mice with targeted disruption of catecholamine￾synthesizing genes, these animals succumb in utero due to
heart failure, before the developmental stage at which cardiac
sympathetic innervation occurs (5, 6). The identification of an
adrenergic cell system outside of the sympathetic nervous sys￾tem is compatible with phylogenetic studies suggesting that
catecholamine-secreting cells that are not part of the sympa￾thetic nervous system are diffusely distributed in vertebrate
and mammalian species and are analogous to those of the ad￾renal medulla (23).

ganglia, but not in ventricular myocytes (Myo; lane 3) 
(30, 20, and 30 mg protein loading for lanes 1, 2, and 
3, respectively). (D) Two major DBH isoforms were 
identified in ICA cells (lane 1). No DBH was de￾tected in cardiac myocytes depleted of ICA cells (lane 
2; 30 mg protein/lane). A single DBH isoform 
(smaller than 60 kD) was detected in cultured rat 
sympathetic neurons (lane 3). (E) PNMT protein was 
detected in ICA cells and sympathetic neurons (n 5 2 
assays), but not in myocytes depleted of ICA cells (20 
mg protein/lane).

Intrinsic Cardiac Adrenergic Cells 1303
Adult rat ICA cells spontaneously released catecholamines
in vitro with high norepinephrine/epinephrine ratio (7.5/1)
(Fig. 4 A). The addition of the b-adrenoreceptor antagonist
timolol to primary cultures of spontaneously beating neonatal
ventricular myocytes, from which ICA cells had not been sys￾temically depleted, resulted in a 58% reduction in beating rate
of myocytes (Fig. 4 B). This is consistent with the constitutive
release of catecholamines by ICA cells and their positively
chronotropic effect on spontaneously beating neonatal myo￾cyte culture. The release ratio of norepinephrine/epinephrine
(7.5/1) was not proportional to the ratio of their cellular con￾tent (16/1) (Table I), suggesting that specific packaging and se￾creting processes may occur for individual catecholamines.
The catecholamines identified in ICA cell primary isolates
could not have been due to contamination from sympathetic
nerve endings because neither immunohistochemical nor elec￾tron microscopic analysis detected any sympathetic nerve fi￾bers or axonal structures in primary ICA cell isolates.
The identification of mRNA and enzymes involved in cate￾cholamine biosynthesis provides evidence for the existence of
the cellular machinery responsible for catecholamine produc￾tion in ICA cells. This, along with epinephrine synthesis and
release in lysates of ICA cell isolates and in media from cul￾tures of these cells (Table I and Fig. 4 A), is consistent with the
observation that sympathetically denervated rat cardiac tissue
retains adrenergic enzymatic activity and is capable of epi￾nephrine production (24). Our data indicate that the mamma￾lian heart possesses intrinsic adrenergic cells with a unique
morphology and catecholamine biosynthetic profile, and that
norepinephrine and epinephrine are constitutively released by
ICA cells in vitro. The presence of this distinct adrenergic cell
population may be essential during cardiac ontogeny and may
have important implications for the regulation of postnatal
cardiac function.
