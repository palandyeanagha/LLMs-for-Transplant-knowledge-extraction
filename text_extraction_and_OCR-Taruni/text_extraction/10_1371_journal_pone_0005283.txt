Abstract
Background: Glucocorticoids levels are high in catabolic conditions but it is unclear how much of the catabolic effects are
due to negative energy balance versus glucocorticoids and whether there are distinct effects on metabolism and functions
of specific muscle proteins.
Methodology/Principal Findings: We determined whether 14 days of high dose methylprednisolone (MPred, 4 mg/kg/d) Vs
food restriction (FR, food intake matched to MPred) in rats had different effects on muscle mitochondrial function and
protein fractional synthesis rates (FSR). Lower weight loss (15%) occurred in FR than in MPred (30%) rats, while a 15%
increase occurred saline-treated Controls. The per cent muscle loss was significantly greater for MPred than FR.
Mitochondrial protein FSR in MPred rats was lower in soleus (51 and 43%, respectively) and plantaris (25 and 55%) than in
FR, while similar decline in protein FSR of the mixed, sarcoplasmic, and myosin heavy chain occurred. Mitochondrial
enzymatic activity and ATP production were unchanged in soleus while in plantaris cytochrome c oxidase activity was lower
in FR than Control, and ATP production rate with pyruvate + malate in MPred plantaris was 28% lower in MPred. Branched￾chain amino acid catabolic enzyme activities were higher in both FR and MPred rats indicating enhanced amino acid
oxidation capacity.
Conclusion/Significance: MPred and FR had little impact on mitochondrial function but reduction in muscle protein
synthesis occurred in MPred that could be explained on the basis of reduced food intake. A greater decline in proteolysis
may explain lesser muscle loss in FR than in MPred rats.

Introduction
Mitochondria are the major intracellular site for fuel oxidation
and ATP production, and undergo adaptive changes in response
to a variety of energy demands. Changes in mitochondrial
function may impact protein metabolism since protein synthesis
and ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation are ATP-dependent.
Catabolic conditions are associated with negative energy balance
and increased levels of catabolic hormones, including glucocorti￾coids. Such catabolic conditions are associated with energy deficit
and accelerated protein loss. However, the impact of glucocorti￾coids and energy restriction on muscle mitochondrial function and
protein metabolism is incompletely defined.
Several prior reports demonstrated that high doses of
glucocorticoids can produce significant muscle wasting within 3–
11 days in rats [1–7]. A greater effect is typically observed in white,
predominantly glycolytic muscles, when compared to red,
oxidative muscles (e.g. soleus) [5–9]. Although muscle protein
synthesis rate was reduced in these glucocorticoid-treated animal
models [2,3,5,8,10], little or no deficit in mitochondrial gene
expression or activity of oxidative enzymes has been observed
[4,6]. This suggests that mitochondria may be less responsive to
the effects of glucocorticoids and thus, one purpose of the present
study was to determine whether synthesis rate of mitochondrial
proteins varies from other muscle protein fractions in glucocor￾ticoid-treated rats.
However, high-dose glucocorticoids are known to induce
anorexia when administered to rodents [8,11] so it is unclear
how much of the glucocorticoid-induced changes in muscle
protein synthesis are related to reduced food intake. Short-term
fasting or energy restriction is known to suppress muscle protein
synthesis rates in both rodents and humans [1,2,12,13]. Available
evidence suggests that the mitochondrial fraction may be relatively
preserved during energy restriction since there was no change in
mitochondrial oxidative capacity following 24 h fasting in mice
[14,15], 7 days [16], or 7 months [17] of moderate food restriction

in rats, or chronic energy restriction in yeast [18]. There are
reports, however, showing that activity of mitochondrial enzymes
and gene transcripts may actually increase in rat muscle during 3
weeks of moderate energy restriction [16]. Nevertheless, these
findings point to potentially differential regulation of muscle
mitochondrial proteins during the catabolic conditions of gluco￾corticoid treatment or food restriction.
We tested the hypothesis that glucocorticoid treatment and food
restriction have a selective effect on synthesis and function of
specific muscle protein units, particularly in the mitochondria. We
also sought to determine whether some or all of the effects of
glucocorticoids are related to reduced food intake and whether
treatment effects vary between predominantly oxidative (i.e.
soleus) and mixed-composition (i.e. plantaris) skeletal muscles in
the rat.
Methods
Animals
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan Laboratories, Indianapolis,
IN) that were approximately 8 weeks old and weighing 260–300
grams initially were used for these studies. Study protocol and
procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee and followed the guidelines of the National
Research Council’s Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals. Rats were housed individually in plastic boxes with
standard bedding under a 12 h: 12 h light: dark cycle. Water and
standard commercial rat chow (Purina AIN-93G, 15% total
energy from protein, 25% from fat, 60% from carbohydrate) were
provided. Food intake and body mass were monitored daily
throughout the study.
Study protocol
Rats were randomly assigned to one of the three study groups of
eight animals each: 1) Saline-treated controls (Control), 2) Food
restricted (FR), or 3) Methylprednisolone-treated (MPred). On
protocol Day 1 each animal was anesthetized with pentobarbital
(Nembutal, 40 mg/kg; Abbot Laboratories, Chicago, IL) via intra￾peritoneal injection, and a mini-osmotic pump (Aztec 2002, Alza
Scientific Products, Palo Alto, CA) was subcutaneously implanted
in the dorsal neck region. Pumps implanted in Control and FR
rats delivered sterile normal saline at 12 ml/day (as specified by the
pump model) for 14 days. The MPred group received methyl￾prednisolone (Solu-Medrol 40 mg Act-O-Vial System, Pharmacia
& Upjohn, Peapeck, NJ) at 4 mg/kg/day for 14 days. Control and
MPred rats had ad libitum access to food. MPred rats decreased
food intake from baseline, as shown in earlier studies [1,2,7,8] and
in order to achieve comparable food intake, the FR group was
supplied with the same amount of food as consumed by the MPred
animals (pair-feeding). Animals in the FR group began the
experiment approximately 1 week after the corresponding animals
in the MPred group to allow for pairfeeding. The amount of food
provided to individual FR animals was matched to a correspond￾ing animal in the MPred group for each experimental day. Body
weight and food consumption were recorded each day in the
middle of the 12 hour light cycle. Food was kept in tip-resistant
bowls. Bowl weight and any visible food on the cage bottom was
used to calculate food intake. In this study we did not determine
whether the temporal pattern of food intake varied among groups.
On the morning of protocol Day 14, food was removed 3 h
before infusion studies began. To measure protein synthesis rate
[ring￾13C6] phenylalanine (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Cam￾bridge MA, 99 atom percent excess, 15 mg/kg) was infused via the
tail vein. At 20 min individual hindlimb skeletal muscles (soleus,
plantaris, quadriceps) were rapidly removed under pentobarbital
anesthesia. Samples were blotted of blood and visible fat and
connective tissue was removed. A portion of soleus and plantaris
muscles were kept on ice in saline-soaked gauze for mitochondrial
studies and the remainder was quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen
and stored at 280 C. Blood was collected via cardiac puncture,
separated into serum (for insulin concentration) or plasma (for
glucose and amino acids) and frozen until further analysis.
Because it was critical to immediately excise a portion of the fresh
muscle for mitochondrial function analyses and then rapidly freeze
the remaining tissue for protein analyses, it was not possible to
measure the wet muscle weight in the initial experiments. We
therefore replicated the study with another set of 24 rats (8 Control,
8 FR and 8 MPred) under identical study conditions to obtain data
on total wet muscle weight immediately following tissue collection.
Blood analysis
Serum glucose was measured using a glucose oxidase method
(Beckman Instruments, Chaska, MN). Insulin was measured with a
two-site immunoenzymatic method performed on the Access
automated immunoassay system (Beckman Instruments, Chaska,
MN).
Mitochondrial function
Mitochondria were isolated concurrently from the soleus and
plantaris by differential centrifugation as previously described [19].
Briefly, samples were homogenized in buffer containing 100 mM
KCl, 50 mM Tris, 5 mM MgCl2, 1.8 mM ATP and 1 mM EDTA
and spun at 7206g at 4 C. The, supernatant was spun at 10,0006g
and the resulting pellet was washed and spun at 9,0006g. The final
pellet was suspended in 180 mM sucrose, 35 mM KH2PO4, 10 Mg
acetate, 5 mM EDTA and kept on ice. Mitochondrial ATP
production rate (MAPR) was measured with a bioluminescent assay
[19–21]. Mitochondria were added to cuvettes containing ATP￾monitoring reagent (AMR, formula SL; BioThema AB, Haninge,
Sweden), oxidizable substrates, and ADP. Substrates added (in mM
final concentration) were: a) 1 pyruvate plus 1 malate, or b) 0.05
palmitoyl-L-carnitine plus 1 malate. All MAPR reactions were
analyzed in duplicate at 25 C in a BioOrbit 1251 luminometer
(BioOrbit Oy, Turku, Finland). Internal calibration was achieved by
the addition of an ATP standard. MAPR was calculated after
measuring the activity of citrate synthase in the mitochondrial
sample and the whole tissue [6,19,20]. Activity of citrate synthase
(CS) and cytochrome c oxidase (COX) was measured using
spectraphotometric assays [20,22].
Muscle protein synthesis rate
Mitochondrial, sarcoplasmic and myosin heavy chain fractions
were separated from both soleus and plantaris muscle samples
(100–150 mg each) of each animal, as previously described [23–
26]. Briefly, mitochondrial and sarcoplasmic protein fractions
were isolated using a similar homogenization and centrifugation
approach as used for the MAPR assay. Myosin heavy chain was
purified using a continuous elution, polyacrylamide gel electro￾phoresis method. Separate 25 mg pieces of the same muscles were
used to isolate the total mixed protein and tissue-free fluid fractions
[25–27]. Total protein concentration was measured with a
colorimetric assay (DC Protein Assay, BioRad Laboratories,
Hercules, CA). Protein samples were hydrolyzed for 24 h in
0.05 mol/L HCl at 110 C in the presence of cation-exchange resin
(AG 50W-X8, BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) [28]. Amino
acids from the protein hydrolysates and tissue fluid fractions were
then purified over a column of the same resin. Samples were
derivatized using N-methyl-N(t-butyldimethylsilyl)-trifluoroaceta￾MPred & FR Effect on Muscle

mide in acetonitrile. Isotopic enrichment in protein-bound amino
acids was measured using gas chromatography-combustion￾isotope ratio mass spectrometry (Finigan-MAT, Bremen Ger￾many) [29]. Enrichment of free amino acids in tissue fluid and
plasma was measured using gas chromatography-mass spectrom￾etry [25,29]. Plasma analysis was limited to 7 Control, 6 MPred
and 7 FR animals due to sample availability.
Fractional protein synthesis was calculated as:
FSR %ð Þ =h ~ Epro  100  ð Þ ETF  Time ,
where Epro and ETF are the isotopic enrichments in muscle protein
and in tissue fluid respectively, and Time is tracer incorporation in
hours.
Activity of branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase
(BCAAT) and a-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKAD)
Activity of BCAAT and BCKAD was measured as an index of
branched-chain amino acid oxidation, which has been shown to
be increased during energy restriction [30]. Since soleus and
plantaris muscle samples of adequate mass were no longer
available from the primary group of animals, the deep (red)
portion of the quadriceps femoris were used, as previously
described [31,32]. Briefly, muscles were homogenized in a buffer,
pH 7.4, containing 20 mM EDTA, 20 mM EGTA, 0.4%
CHAPSO, 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 25 mM HEPES and
protease inhibitor cocktail (Complete Mini, Roche Applied
Science, Indianapolis, IN). After two freeze-thaw cycles, samples
were centrifuged at 15,000 g for 10 min at 4 C. The supernatant
was used to measure BCAAT and BCKAD by monitoring the
change in NADH absorbance at 37 C. The BCAAT reaction
mixture contained 5 mM pyridoxal 59-phosphate, 5 mM
ammonium sulfate, 0.05 mM NADH, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 5
mM a-ketoglutarate, 10 mM L-leucine, 0.5 mM guanosine 59-
triphosphate, and 50 mg leucine dehydrogenase (LeuDH) in 100
mM potassium phosphate buffer. Due to the presence of
ammonia, NADH and a-ketoglutarate in the BCAAT mixture,
endogenous glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) activity may
interfere with the measurement of BCAAT activity. Therefore,
BCAAT activity was estimated as the difference between the
absorbance change in reaction with (measure of GDH plus
BCAAT activity) and without (measure of GDH activity only)
LeuDH included [32]. The BCKAD reaction mixture contained 5
mM pyridoxal 59-phosphate, 5 mM ammonium sulfate, 0.05 mM
NADH, 5 mM dithiothreitol and 4.5 mM a-ketoisocaproate in
100 mM potassium phosphate buffer.
Statistics
The number of animals per group was chosen based on data for
mitochondrial protein synthesis rate and ATP production from a
prior study [20,33]. Power to detect differences in other outcomes
may be lower. Differences among treatment groups for most of the
data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance. Repeated
measures analysis of variance was used for food intake and body
mass. Where appropriate, pairwise comparisons among means
were performed using Tukey’s post-hoc test. In all cases, P-values
less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Results
Food intake and body mass (Fig. 1)
Food consumption prior to pump implantation was similar
among the groups at 20–25 g/day and declined on the day after
pump implantation. Food intake in the Control group recovered
within 2 days and remained within 5% of the baseline value
through Day 14. In contrast, the MPred group consumed 31% less
food versus Control (P,0.001) during the entire treatment period.
By design, food intake of FR animals matched that of the MPred
animals. FR animals ate all of the food provided.
Initial body mass did not differ among the groups (Con￾trol = 27265 g, MPred = 27464 g, FR = 27165 g, P.0.88). By
Day 14 body mass of Control animals increased 15% from baseline
while FR rats decreased 15%, and MPred rats decreased 30%. In
pairwise comparisons there were significant differences in final
body mass among each of the three groups (P,0.001).
Glucose and insulin concentration
Plasma glucose concentration at the end of the study in Control
animals was 10.360.5 mmol/l and serum insulin concentration
was 244644 pmol/l. In comparison to the Control group, FR
animals had significantly reduced insulin (4367 pmol/l, P,0.01)
and tended to have lower glucose (8.360.8 mmol/l, P =0.070). In
MPred rats, both glucose (18.161.6 mmol/l) and insulin (453633
pmol/l) concentrations were elevated (P,0.01) compared to the
Control and FR groups.
Muscle mass (Table 1)
As noted above, all measurements except muscle mass were
acquired from the same set of animals. Muscle mass was measured
in a repeat experiment conducted under identical conditions.
Compared to Control animals, soleus muscle mass in the FR

group was not significantly different, while plantaris was 15% lower
(P,0.03). A larger difference was evident in the MPred group, as
soleus was 19% lower than Control and plantaris was 48% lower
than Control (both p,0.01). Additionally, both of these muscles
were smaller for the MPred group compared to those of the FR
group (P,0.01). A portion of each muscle was weighed before and
after freeze-drying. No differences were observed for final dry
weight or percent water content (Control = 75.461.0%,
MPred = 75.960.7 and FR = 76.261.1). These data demonstrate
that lower muscle mass in the MPred group was not due to
dehydration secondary to prednisolone-induced hyperglycemia.
Mitochondrial function
In the soleus there were no differences among treatment groups
for the activity of CS or COX enzymes, or for MAPR (Table 1). In
the plantaris, COX activity was 32% lower in the FR group
compared to Control (P,0.05). MAPR with pyruvate + malate
was 28% lower in the MPred plantaris compared to Control but
there were no differences among groups in plantaris MAPR with
palmitoyl-L-carnitine + malate.
Muscle protein metabolism
The concentration of total mixed muscle proteins in the Control
soleus was 18064 mg/mg. There was a non-significant trend for
lower values in FR (16964 mg/mg, P = 0.08 versus Control) and
MPred (16965 mg/mg, P = 0.10 versus Control). In the plantaris,
protein concentration was 20164 mg/mg tissue in Controls,
19064 mg/mg in FR (P = 0.07 versus Control) and 18963 mg/mg
in MPred (P =0.03 versus Control).
Tracer enrichment in proteins and muscle tissue fluid are shown
in Table 2. With one exception (soleus mixed protein) the protein￾bound tracer enrichment was significantly lower in the FR and
MPred groups compared to Control for each tissue fraction (total
mixed, mitochondria, sarcoplasmic, and MHC) in both soleus and
plantaris. Protein-bound enrichment was also significantly lower in
the MPred versus FR for all soleus protein fractions and for total
and mitochondrial fractions in plantaris. Tissue fluid [13C6]
phenylalanine enrichment did not differ between the Control and
MPred groups, but was significantly higher in both FR soleus and
plantaris versus Control and MPred muscles. Consistent with
previous studies [27,34] plasma [13C6] phenylalanine enrichment
was lower (p,0.05) than muscle tissue fluid in all groups, but the
differences among groups for plasma [13C6] phenylalanine
(Control, 9.7561.33 molar per cent excess; FR, 18.1761.82;
MPred, 9.4561.21) was the same as for tissue fluid.
Fractional synthesis rates (FSR) are shown in Figure 2. In all
groups and in both muscles, the mitochondrial protein FSR was

50–200% higher (P,0.002) than the FSR of total mixed,
sarcoplasmic or MHC proteins. Within the Control group,
mitochondrial, sarcoplasmic and MHC FSR were 39–49% lower
in plantaris than soleus (P,0.015), though the mixed protein FSR
was only 18% lower in plantaris (P =0.15). In FR group FSR of
each protein fraction was 51–69% lower in plantaris than in soleus
(P,0.02). In the MPred group, sarcoplasmic protein FSR was
41% lower in plantaris (P,0.002), while the other fractions were
only 15–19% lower (P.0.05).
Compared to Control values FSR of all soleus protein fractions
was reduced by 37–65% (P,0.015) in the FR and MPred groups.
There were no significant differences in FSR between FR and
MPred in the soleus. In the plantaris, the FSR of all protein
fractions were reduced by 25–70% in FR and MPred compared to
Control. All of these differences reached statistical significance
(P,0.05) except for MHC in the MPred group, which showed a
trend in the same direction (52% lower than Control, P =0.069).
Additionally, FSR of the FR plantaris mixed, mitochondrial, and
sarcoplasmic proteins was 19–30% lower (P,0.02) compared to
MPred.

BCAAT activity in quadriceps muscle was 85% (P = 0.018) and

compared to Control. BCKAD activity in the same samples was
51% higher in both the FR and MPred groups (P = 0.035)
compared to Control.
Discussion
The main new finding in the current study was that muscle
mitochondrial function was largely maintained following 14 d of
either methylprednisolone treatment or food restriction, despite
the fact that both conditions resulted in loss of muscle mass and
reduction in mitochondrial protein synthesis rate. The decline in
mixed muscle protein synthesis rate in MPred and FR animals is
consistent with prior studies, but we hypothesized that mitochon￾drial proteins may be differentially regulated from other muscle
proteins. A relative preservation of mitochondrial protein synthesis
would be an attractive explanation for maintenance of mitochon￾drial function during catabolic stress but the results show that
suppression of protein synthesis affected all protein fractions.
Mitochondrial functional measures in the soleus muscle were
not affected by either MPred or FR treatment but the plantaris
muscle did show limited changes. FR resulted in a decrease in
COX activity in the plantaris muscle but this difference appears to
have had minimal impact on ATP generating capacity with either
of the substrate combinations used. This suggests that there was
either ample reserve capacity of the COX enzyme or other
compensatory regulation occurred. In comparison, a reduction in
ATP production rate with pyruvate + malate in plantaris muscle
was the only mitochondrial function change resulting from MPred
treatment. Since ATP production rate with the fatty acid substrate
palmitoyl-carnitine was maintained in the MPred plantaris it is
likely that an early step specific to pyruvate metabolism, such as
transport into the mitochondria, was affected by MPred treatment
and responsible for the differential results. This interpretation
would also suggest that most of the remaining common pathways
leading to ATP synthesis (Kreb’s cycle and electron transport
chain) remain unchanged during MPred treatment. It is presently
unclear why pyruvate metabolism would be selectively affected by
glucocorticoid action in the mixed oxidative-glycolytic plantaris
but not in soleus., which has higher oxidative capacity. This
finding is, however, consistent with the pattern of muscle-specific
effects of glucocorticoid action, which has been shown, for
example to induce greater atrophy in white/glycolytic muscles
compared to the predominantly oxidative soleus [7].
To our knowledge this is the first study to compare
mitochondrial ATP production rates in multiple muscles of rats
undergoing FR and MPred treatments. The current findings are
mostly in agreement with earlier reports showing that short (up to

7 days) or longer term (up to 7 months) food restriction does not
impair muscle mitochondrial ATP production or enzymatic
activity [14,16,17], and may actually lead to increased mitochon￾drial oxidative capacity in some cases. It was shown, for example,
that a 24% reduction in food intake (versus ad libitum) for 7 days
results in increased mRNA expression of COX enzyme subunits in
rat muscle and that activity of COX and citrate synthase are
increased by 21 days [16]. It is not clear why those results differed
from the present findings, where mitochondrial function and COX
mRNA were not increased after 14 days of food restriction.
However, the likelihood of mitochondrial enhancement may be
greater with longer durations studies as we previously reported
that mitochondrial ATP production with palmitoyl-carnitine
increased in rat muscle following 7 months of food restriction
[17]. As with FR, muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity is
typically preserved in rats treated with glucocorticoids for 10–11
days [4,6,35]. For example, despite muscle atrophy there was no
change in the activity of citrate synthase or COX, or the
abundance of COX subunit mRNAs in plantaris muscle in
glucocorticoid-treated rats [4,6]. There are exceptions, however,
as it was reported that COX activity declined in plantaris muscle
in dose-dependent fashion in rats treated with corticosterone for
12 days [36]. The opposite effect was shown in study of young rats
treated with dexamethasone for 3 days in which cytochrome c
content and the abundance of mitochondrial gene transcripts were
increased in quadriceps muscle [37]. This latter study differed,
however, from most other comparable studies [2,8,10,36], in that
a decrease in food intake or body weight was not observed during
the 3 day protocol, which may explain those unique findings. The
variable responses in mitochondrial function to glucocorticoids
may be due to several factors including the form of glucocorticoid
administered (which have different potencies [9]), the route of
delivery (i.e., daily injections versus continuous pump delivery as
used in the present study), the length of treatment, and the strain
or age of animals used [2,36].
We examined the fractional synthesis rate of the total mixed
protein pool as well as the mitochondrial, sarcoplasmic and
myosin heavy chain subfractions. The finding that synthesis of
mitochondrial proteins was consistently higher than other proteins
within the same tissue and that synthesis rates of the same proteins
varied between tissues (e.g. higher rates in soleus versus plantaris)
demonstrates that protein synthesis can be differentially regulated
within and between tissues [34,34,38]. Yet we found that, with
limited exception, both MPred and FR treatments resulted in
reduced synthesis of all of the protein fractions in both soleus and
plantaris muscles when compared to Control, indicating that both
FR and MPred treatments have a global suppression effect on
muscle protein synthesis rate. Our finding on glucocorticoid effects
agrees with a prior report showing that protein synthesis was
similarly reduced in glycolytic and oxidative muscles by 5 days of
dexamethasone injection [8]. In contrast, another study showed
that 6 days of dexamethasone treatment caused a greater decline
in mixed muscle protein synthesis rate in gastrocnemius compared
to the soleus [9]. To our knowledge the effects of FR on protein
synthesis rates in different muscles has not previously been
reported.
The decline in muscle protein synthesis in the MPred rats may
be partly due to anorexia since similar or greater reductions in
protein synthesis were observed in the FR group. Many of the
prior studies that reported a reduction in mixed muscle protein
synthesis in rats given high doses of glucocorticoids for up to 12
days did not account for the potential effect of reduced food intake
[3,5,9,39]. Since energy deficit alone can cause a reduction in
muscle protein synthesis rate [12,13,40], it is important to control
for food intake when these outcomes are analyzed. Among studies
implementing pair-feeding, however, the impact of glucocorticoids
has not been consistent. In contrast to our results, it was reported
that in vivo mixed muscle protein synthesis was reduced more in
rats injected with dexamethasone for 5 days than in pair-fed
controls [8]. In the absence of an ad libitum-fed control group
though, it was unclear how much of an effect the reduced food
intake per se had on protein synthesis. When the same investigators
measured protein synthesis in the epitrochlearis muscle using an in
vitro technique they found no difference between dexamethasone￾treated and pair-fed animals [1,2]. Thus, it is unclear whether the
discrepancy among these studies is due to the differences in the
muscles tested or the measurement techniques used.
The MPred group had lower body mass and muscle mass than
the FR group, demonstrating a greater catabolic effect of
glucocorticoids compared to food restriction alone. The difference
in muscle mass cannot be explained either by protein synthesis or
by muscle hydration, which did not differ among groups, Nor can
the differences in muscle loss be attributed to activity of the
branched-chain amino acid transamination (BCAAT) and oxida￾tion (BCKAD) enzymes, which were similarly increased in both
FR and MPred muscles. Another potential reason for the greater
catabolic effect in Mpred group is greater muscle protein
catabolism in MPred than FR. This is supported by earlier studies
showing that during fasting or energy restriction muscle protein
synthesis and breakdown decrease [1,2,12,13,41], whereas in
response to glucocorticoids markers of protein breakdown and
proteolytic pathways are elevated [1,42]. It has been repeatedly
shown that glucocorticoid-stimulated muscle protein breakdown is
mediated primarily through ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent pro￾teolysis and other calcium-dependent protein degradation path￾ways [43].
Although measuring breakdown rates of specific tissues or
proteins is not yet possible in vivo, the tracer data available do
provide indirect evidence that protein breakdown was higher in
the MPred group versus FR. Since all animals received the same
amount of [13C6] phenylalanine tracer, the higher enrichment in
plasma and muscle free pools of the FR group could occur only if
the appearance rate of unlabeled phenylalanine from protein
breakdown was substantially reduced compared to MPred rats and
Controls. There are no alternative explanations that we are aware
of to explain these clear differences in plasma and tissue fluid
enrichment. Moreover, this interpretation, although relying on an
indirect index, can account for the differences in final muscle mass.
Thus, while muscle protein synthesis was reduced in the FR group
versus Control, the loss of muscle mass was minimized due to a
concomitant decline in protein breakdown. The greater loss of
muscle mass in the MPred group appears to be due to reduced
protein synthesis rate along with protein breakdown that remained
similar to the Control group. The failure of protein breakdown to
decrease along with protein synthesis would result in negative
protein balance and muscle wasting in MPred animals.
Our regimen of methylprednisolone at 4 mg/kg/day for 14 days
in young adult rats was selected to ensure that a high
pharmacological glucocorticoid effect would be achieved and it
is among the longest duration of treatment at a pharmacologic
dosage in studies of muscle metabolism. This may account for the
strong, sustained decline in food intake and body mass. In
comparison, studies in healthy humans have typically been limited
to up to one week of moderate-dose treatment, with the effect of
increased whole body protein breakdown under post-absorptive
conditions in some [44,45], but not all [46] studies. Under these
dose and duration levels, glucocorticoid treatment appears to have
no effect on mixed muscle protein synthesis or mitochondrial

function in humans [45–47] but may increase muscle protein
breakdown or net amino acid release (an index of catabolism) in
some [45,47,48] but not all [46] studies. High dose glucocorticoids
and synthetic preparations, such as dexamethasone, are routinely
used in acutely ill patients with brain tumors or cerebral edema.
To our knowledge though, the impact of these interventions on
muscle mitochondrial metabolism and food intake have not been
evaluated. Although the effects of glucocorticoids found in our
study cannot be directly applied to human subjects receiving
moderate doses of glucocorticoids, the effects of energy restriction
may be relevant to clinical states such as postoperative recovery
when food intake is restricted.
In conclusion, the current study demonstrates that both FR and
MPred treatments result in loss of body mass and muscle mass
during a 14 d intervention. However, muscle mitochondrial
function was largely unchanged in oxidative and mixed oxidative￾glycolytic muscles following both FR and MPred. The mainte￾nance of mitochondrial function occurred at the same time there
was a ,40–50% decline in the rate of synthesis of mitochondrial
proteins in the same muscles. It is not yet known whether
mitochondrial proteins are differentially targeted for breakdown
under these conditions or if other compensatory mechanisms may
explain the maintenance of mitochondrial function. The finding
that the decline in muscle protein synthesis was similar in FR and
MPred rats highlights the importance of accounting for changes in
food intake in rats receiving glucocorticoids.
