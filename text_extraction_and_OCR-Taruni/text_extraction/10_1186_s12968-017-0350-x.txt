Abstract
Background: While most patients recover from suspected acute myocarditis (sAMC) some develop progressive
disease with 5-year mortality up to 20%. Recently, parametric Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) approaches,
quantifying native T1 and T2 relaxation time, have demonstrated the ability to increase diagnostic accuracy. However,
prognostic implications of T2 values in this cohort are unknown. The purpose of the study was to investigate the
prognostic relevance of elevated CMR T2 values in patients with sAMC.
Methods and Results: We carried out a prospective study in 46 patients with sAMC defined by current ESC
recommendations. A combined endpoint was defined by the occurrence of at least one major adverse cardiac event
(MACE) and hospitalisation for heart failure. Event rate was 24% (n = 11) for 1-year-MACE and hospitalisation.
A follow-up after 11 ± 7 months was performed in 98% of the patients. Global T2 values were significantly
increased at acute stage of disease compared to controls and decreased over time. During acute disease, elevated global
T2 time (odds ratio 6.3, p < 0.02) as well as myocardial fraction with T2 time >80 ms (odds ratio 4.9, p < 0.04)
predicted occurrence of the combined endpoint. Patients with clinical recovery revealed significantly decreased T2
relaxation times at follow-up examinations; however, T2 values were still elevated compared to healthy controls.
Conclusion: Assessment of myocardial T2 relaxation times at initial presentation facilitates CMR-based risk stratification
in patients with acute myocarditis. T2 Mapping may emerge as a new tool to monitor inflammatory myocardial injuries
during the course of disease.

Background
Myocarditis is a common cardiac disease with a preva￾lence of 22 per 100.000 people worldwide [1]. However,
the diagnosis remains challenging due to its variable
clinical presentation and individual shortcomings of
diagnostic tools. Myocarditis has been reported in up to
20% of sudden cardiac deaths among young adults and is
regarded as precursor of dilated cardiomyopathy [2, 3]. In
the light of a highly variable clinical presentation ranging
from full recovery in the majority of patients to progres￾sive heart failure in some patients, diagnostic accuracy
and individual risk stratification is of prime importance.
Patients with severe forms of myocarditis have a 5-year
mortality of almost 20% [4].
Recent recommendations highlight the need for new
diagnostic criteria in patients with suspected acute
myocarditis (sAMC) and endorse coronary angiography as
well as endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) during routine
diagnostic workup [5, 6]. Besides EMB, Cardiovascular
Magnetic Resonance (CMR) emerged as a key non-invasive

tool for diagnosis of myocarditis [7]. Recently, parametric
CMR approaches quantifying native T1 and T2 relaxation
time, have increased CMR-based diagnostic accuracy for
sAMC [8–13]. Additionally, increased myocardial T2 values
were shown to correlate with edema [14] and myocardial
inflammation in EMB [8, 10].
Recently, we demonstrated increased T2 values in pa￾tients with biopsy-proven acute myocarditis (bpAMC)
compared to age and gender matched controls [10, 15].
Furthermore, we proposed a diagnostic approach quanti￾fying the extent of myocardium with pathologically
elevated T2 time expressed as percentage of whole
myocardium, thus taking accumulating regional inflam￾mation into account. This strategy improved CMR-based
diagnosis of bpAMC. So far, prognostic implications of
abnormal elevated T2 values with respect to clinical and
functional recovery are unknown.
Until now, several predictors of poor outcome have
been identified, including reduced left ventricular ejection
fraction (LVEF) [16], advanced New York Heart Associ￾ation (NYHA) class, grade of histopathological forms of
tissue damage [17] and presence of Late Gadolinium
Enhancement (LGE) [4].
The aim of the presented study was to prospectively
recruit patients with sAMC and conduct CMR and EMB
as systematic as feasible in order to assess the prognostic
value of T2 Mapping in this patient cohort. We hypothe￾sized that T2 Mapping facilitates risk stratification in
patients referred for CMR workup of sAMC. In particular,
we sought to evaluate whether T2 Mapping provides
additional prognostic information over conventional CMR
parameters and identifies patients at high-risk for follow￾ing adverse cardiac events.
Methods
Study population
The ethical board of Heinrich-Heine University Düsseldorf
approved the present study (application number
4307). All participants signed informed consent. The
study complies with the declaration of Helsinki.
Forty-six patients meeting inclusion criteria of sAMC
according to ESC guidelines were prospectively enrolled
between 2013 and 2016: clinical symptoms <14 days
(dyspnoea, chest pain, fatigue) and one additional
diagnostic criterion in terms of ECG abnormalities
(ST-changes, conduction defects), hsTNT-elevation or
new global/regional wall motion abnormalities and
exclusion of coronary artery disease.
Exclusion criteria of the study were 1) coronary artery
disease (coronary stenosis >50% proven by angiography
2) pre-existing other cardiac disease that could explain
symptoms and 3) contraindications against CMR.
All patients underwent CMR between day 0 and day 5
after initial presentation at hospital. Right ventricular
EMB was conducted whenever feasible (n = 40, 72 ± 12 h
after presentation).
Patients were scheduled after informed consent for a
follow-up assessment 6 to 18 months after the initial
hospitalisation. Left ventricular systolic function at follow￾up was assessed by CMR or 3D-echocardiography. Sixty
age, sex and cardiovascular risk factor -matched volunteers
served as controls.
CMR imaging and analysis
CMR was performed using a 1.5 tesla scanner (Achieva,
Philips, Best Netherlands) with a 32-channel phased
array coil. After scout and reference scans, CINE-loops
in continuous short axis slices covering the whole
ventricle were analyzed to calculate left ventricular func￾tion and volumes.
For edema imaging, a T2-weighted TSE-STIR se￾quence was used and T2 Mapping was conducted with a
GRASE sequence in three short axis slices (basal, mid￾ventricular and apical). This sequence combines the TSE
and echo-planar imaging methods by using a train of
refocusing 180° pulses and an odd number of additional
gradient echoes for each spin echo. This sequence was
used with cardiac triggering and respiration navigator
gating with the following parameters: TR = 1 RR interval,
number of echo images = 15, echo spacing 10 ms,
leading to an echo train of 150 ms, number of gradient
echoes for segmented acquisition = 3 (EPI factor),
FA = 90°, spatial resolution: 2 × 2 × 10 mm3
, parallel
imaging (SENSE) with an accelerating factor of 2,
k-space data acquired with Cartesian encoding scheme.
For blood saturation a double inversion (black-blood)
pulse was used [14].
Late Gadolinium Enhancement (LGE) imaging was
performed eight to ten minutes after gadolinium contrast
injection (ProHance®, Bracco Imaging, 0.2 mmol/kg) using a
3-dimensional–gradient spoiled turbo fast-field-echo
sequence with a non-selective 180° inversion-recovery pre--
pulse triggered to end-diastole acquired in the short axis,
4–3- and 2-chamber view to cover the whole ventricle.
For post-processing, left ventricular function and LGE
were assessed off-line using a commercial software
(Extended Workspace, Philips Healthcare). LGE was
evaluated by visual assessment and assignment of certain
myocardial parts according to the 17-segment model of
the AHA [18].
T2 maps were generated according to Bönner et al.
[15]. T2 maps were generated off-line using software
based on the graphical programming language LabVIEW
(National Instruments, Austin, TX). An exponential
decay curve was fitted to the intensity decline of each
pixel within the images obtained from the multi echo
sequence. We used a 2-parameter (amplitude and damp￾ing) fit model with a constant off-set. The bias was
Spieker et al. Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (2017) 19:38 Page 2 of 9

calculated from the noise of all echo images and
assumed to be constant, so that the problem could be
linearized and the regression coefficient (R2
) could be
used as a goodness-of-fit parameter in order to exclude
accidental values. If R2 was not within a tolerance inter￾val chosen to be 0.7-1, the corresponding T2 value was
not considered for further calculations. The resulting T2
constants were colour-coded using the spectral look-up
table. Endo- and epimyocardial region of interests (ROI)
were drawn manually in the first echo image of the
echo-train.
The myocardial ROI was segmented according to the
AHA 17-segment model [18] and T2 values were calcu￾lated for 16 segments (segment 17 was not considered).
In order to detect regional edema more reliably we
quantified the myocardial fraction with T2 time over
several cut-offs. ROC analysis suggested that a selected
cut-off over 80 ms was the best parameter to distinguish
between biopsy-proven inflamed myocardium and
healthy myocardium. This cut-off was determined in a
previous study including 26 patients with bpAMC and
60 healthy controls [10]. The myocardial fraction ex￾ceeding 80 ms was quantified and expressed as percent￾age of the whole myocardium and graphically
highlighted in white. To avoid spill over of high T2
values due to epicardial fat and endocardial slow flow ar￾tefacts a T2 time limit of 110 ms was chosen in the final
absolute T2 time and fractional quantification.
Endpoints and clinical follow-up
Patients were followed over time and a combined clin￾ical endpoint was defined as a composite of major
adverse cardiac events (MACE) and hospitalisation due
to heart failure. MACE was defined as a composite of
all-cause death, cardiac death, cardiac transplantation
and ventricular assist device implantation. The length of
follow-up was determined by occurrence of an endpoint
or the last clinical follow-up examination.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed with Sigma Stat2010
(Systat GmbH) and GraphPad Prism 7. Unless otherwise
stated, data are presented as mean value ± standard
deviation. Data were statistically analysed by the paired
or unpaired Student’s t-test. Welch’s correction was used
when unequal SD was assumed. Bonferroni correction
was applied for multiple comparisons. Fisher’s exact test
was used to examine the significance of the association
between two kinds of classification. Receiver operator
characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to generate
threshold values with respect to optimal sensitivities,
specificities and areas under the curve (AUC). Kaplan￾Meier curves were calculated for visualizing cumulative
event free survival of patients with global and regional
T2 time exceeding several cut-offs. P-values below 0.05
were assumed to be significant.
Results
Baseline patient characteristics
A total of 46 patients matched inclusion criteria.
Table 1 shows baseline patient characteristics. Positive
troponin (troponin >14.0 ng/ml) was detected in 83%
with a mean value of 375 ± 512 ng/ml. The majority
(57%) suffered from chest pain on admission and 43%
of patients complained about severe dyspnoea (NYHA
class III to IV).
Forty-three patients underwent coronary angiography
to exclude coronary artery disease (CAD). Another three
patients (age < 35 years) refused invasive coronary
assessment. Forty patients underwent EMB during initial
workup. Within those 40 patients, 22 were characterized
as having bpAMC.
Initial CMR assessment demonstrated significantly
reduced LVEF in patients with sAMC compared to
controls (sAMC (n = 46) vs. controls (n = 60): 42 ± 15%
vs. 62 ± 8%; p < 0.001). LGE was present in 80% of all
sAMC patients. T2 time was significantly elevated in
patients with sAMC (sAMC (n = 46) vs. controls (n = 60):
68.1 ± 5.8 ms vs. 60.0 ± 4.2 ms; p < 0.001). (Table 2)

Clinical follow-up
Forty-five patients (98%) underwent follow-up examin￾ation after a mean interval of 11 ± 7 months. Eleven pa￾tients (24%) reached the combined endpoint: One
patient died, one patient underwent heart transplant￾ation and three patients received ventricular assist device
implantation due to severe, therapy-refractory heart
failure. Six patients were re-admitted to hospital for
decompensating heart failure. Thirteen patients (29%)
showed persistent left ventricular dysfunction. Mean
LVEF at follow-up was 51 ± 13% with a mean absolute
increase in LVEF of 10 ± 13%.
Predictors of clinical outcome
Patients who experienced the combined endpoint
displayed increased global and regional T2 values at first
CMR compared to those who did not (combined
endpoint (n = 11) vs. clinical recovery (n = 34), global T2
time: 71.8 ± 5.7 ms vs. 66.8 ± 4.9 ms, p = 0.01; fraction
with T2 time >80 ms: 27.5 ± 14.9% vs. 15.1 ± 8.7, p =
0.03) (Fig. 1). At initial presentation, elevated global T2
time as well as extent of myocardium with T2 time
above 80 ms predicted occurrence of the combined
endpoint (Table 3). Kaplan-Meier survival curves gener￾ated for the combined endpoint are displayed in Fig. 2.
Patients with global T2 time >4 SD represented a
subgroup with elevated risk corresponding to a cumula￾tive event rate of 55%. In contrast, patients with global
T2 time <2 SD had a cumulative event rate of 14%.
Likewise, reduced left ventricular function at initial
presentation was associated with an unfavourable
outcome: Seven patients (64%) who experienced the
combined endpoint presented with severely reduced
LVEF (LVEF <30%) (odds ratio 6.8, p < 0.02). In con￾trast 7 patients (21%) of those who recovered showed
severely reduced LVEF at first presentation (Table 3).
Moreover, initial impairment of LVEF was associated
with an abnormal LVEF at follow-up (patients with
LVEF <55% at follow-up (n = 19) had mean LVEF of
34 ± 13% at initial presentation vs. patients with LVEF
>55% at follow-up (n = 23) displayed an initial LVEF
of 47 ± 13%, p = 0.003).

fraction with abnormal T2 time at first presentation was larger in patients who reached endpoint (combined endpoint: 27.5 ± 14.9% vs. no endpoint:
15.1 ± 8.7%. p = 0.03). Abbreviations: Fraction >80 ms = Percentage of myocardial fraction with T2 time >80 ms

There was no significant correlation between per￾sistent left ventricular dysfunction and clinical presen￾tation, inflammation on EMB, blood biomarkers or
CMR parameters (LGE, T2 weighted Imaging, T2
Mapping).
T2 Mapping in the course of disease
In a subset of patients (23/45) monitoring of T2 values
over time was possible: Global T2 values were signifi￾cantly increased at first presentation compared to fol￾low-up examination and controls. In line with this,
the extent of myocardium with T2 time above 80 ms
was markedly larger in the acute phase of disease
(Fig. 3).
At follow-up T2 values decreased significantly in a
global but not in a regional manner, however, being still
elevated compared to controls (follow-up patients (n =
23) vs. controls (n = 60), global T2 time: 64.4 ± 6.4 ms vs.
60.0 ± 4.2 ms, p = 0.001; fraction with T2 time >80 ms:
13.6 ± 13.3% vs. 4.1 ± 3.0%, p = 0.004). Furthermore, pa￾tients who reached the combined endpoint or presented
with persistent left ventricular dysfunction at follow-up
displayed persistently elevated T2 values compared to
those who recovered completely. In contrast, recovery of
LVEF went along with decreasing T2 values (Fig. 4).
Discussion
The present study substantiates the prognostic implica￾tion of CMR based myocardial T2 Mapping in patients
with sAMC. This may improve individual risk stratifica￾tion in this patient cohort. The core findings are: (a)

Predictors of clinical outcome in acute myocarditis
Several studies reported that native T2 time is increased
in patients with clinical diagnosis of acute myocarditis
[8, 9, 19, 20]. Only recently, we demonstrated that T2
Mapping increases diagnostic accuracy for bpAMC [10].
The presented study demonstrates that measurement of
global T2 time provides additional prognostic information
and facilitates risk stratification in patients presenting with
myocarditis. Kaplan-Meier curves generated among differ￾ent groups of patients (T2 time <2 SD, >2 SD, <4 SD and
>4 SD compared to controls) showed a significantly shorter
event-free interval in patients with global T2 time ex￾ceeding 4 SD. Furthermore, the percentage of myo￾cardial fraction with T2 time above 80 ms was higher
in patients, who reached the combined endpoint. On
the other hand patients with normal T2 values were at
low risk for following events.

Fig. 3 T2 time during the course of disease. Global T2 time and percentage of myocardial extent with T2 values exceeding 80 ms (Fraction >80 ms) is
elevated in patients with acute myocarditis (sAMC) compared to healed myocarditis and controls. Global myocardial T2 time led to a
significant distinction of controls (n = 60) and patients with acute myocarditis (n = 46) (p < 0.001). T2 time at follow-up examination (n = 23) was markedly
lower (64.4 ± 6.4 ms) than in patients at acute stage of disease (n = 46) (68.1 ± 5.8 ms) (p = 0.02) and higher than in controls (n = 60) (60.0 ± 4.2 ms)
(p < 0.001). Left ventricular extent with T2 time exceeding 80 ms allows a differentiation between controls (4.1 ± 3.0%) and patients with
acute myocarditis (17.7 ± 11.5%) (p < 0.001), as well as between healed myocarditis (13.6 ± 13.3%) and controls (p = 0.04), but not between
active and healed myocarditis (p = 0.14). The error bars indicate median with interquartile range. Abbreviations: CMR = Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance,

adverse outcome (cardiac death, heart transplantation,
ventricular assist device implantation) highlights the
potential of T2 Mapping strategies to identify patients at
risk. Assuming that an acute myocarditis is characterized
by widespread cell damage, inflammation and edema,
global T2 time yielded a higher odds ratio for predicting
combined endpoint than the regional approach did.
Furthermore, this study showed that an adverse clinical
outcome was associated with the grade of elevation of
global T2 time and amount of myocardial area with
increased T2 values.
T1 Mapping provides high diagnostic accuracy in con￾firmation and exclusion of myocarditis and also showed
its ability to differentiate between different stages of
disease activity [12, 21]. Recently, Puntmann et al. substan￾tiated the prognostic value of T1 Mapping in a large cohort
of patients with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy [22].
However, a prognostic value of T2 Mapping in acute
myocarditis has not been demonstrated yet.
Lurz et al. demonstrated that T1 Mapping did not
provide additional diagnostic information in patients with
chronic symptoms, which could be explained by histo￾logical pathology [13]. Acute inflammatory responses, such
as necrosis, edema and hyperemia, are believed to regress
as expansion of the extracellular space due to diffuse fibro￾sis processes. As a result, T1 relaxation time decreases over
time [21, 23]. It remains questionable, whether T1 Mapping
in early stages is solely increased due to edema and
hyperemia. If this is the case, T1 Mapping might suffer
from decreased sensitivity compared to T2 Mapping,
which could explain the lack of prognostic value.
However, this remains speculative at the moment.
Recent data also confirm the value of ventricular func￾tion as an independent predictor of outcome in patients
with acute myocarditis [4, 24]. Biventricular dysfunction
at initial presentation has already been identified as a
predictor for death and cardiac transplantation [25].
Moreover, baseline left ventricular function was a
marker of prognosis regardless of the clinical pattern of
disease onset [16]. The presented study yielded similar
results (Table 3). The alteration of LVEF at the initial
CMR was a strong predictor of outcome.
In addition, presence of LGE is a controversial predictor
of outcome in acute myocarditis. Grün et al. investigated a
large population of patients with biopsy-proven viral myo￾carditis who also underwent CMR. In their study LGE was
the best predictor for all-cause- and cardiac mortality [4]. In
line with this, we confirm that 91% of patients who reached
combined endpoint had presence of LGE on first CMR.
Note that only one patient without presence of LGE experi￾enced the endpoint. However specificity was low (29%) ren￾dering individual patient counselling impractical (Table 3).
Similarly, Sanguineti et al. investigated 203 consecutive pa￾tients with an initial CMR-based diagnosis of acute myocar￾ditis and described an initial alteration of LVEF as the only
independent CMR predictor of adverse clinical outcome. In
this context LGE was not predictive for outcome [24].
In a previous published study myocardial edema
assessment by T2 weighted Imaging was a strong
predictor for left ventricular function recovery [26].
Vermes et al. hypothesized that observed improvement
of systolic function reflects recovery of reversible injured
myocardium. Our results show that T2 weighted Imaging
was neither sensitive nor specific in predicting clinical
Fig. 4 T2 Mapping and LGE at initial presentation and at follow-up. Apical, midventricular and basal short axis slices of a patient with biopsy-proven
acute myocarditis are displayed at initial presentation and at 12 months follow-up. Coloured T2 maps display global T2 values in a color code ranging
from 0 to 150 ms while regional T2 values exceeding 80 ms are given as white overlays. Late Gadolinium Enhancement (LGE) images are shown next
to the T2 analysis in identical short axis slice. Red arrows point towards regions of LGE uptake at initial presentation. Arrowheads point
towards a region with persistent LGE and with low (blue) T2 values. Abbreviations: Fraction >80 ms = Percentage of myocardial extent

outcome. T2 weighted Imaging suffers from several limita￾tions like motion artefacts and low sensitivity, which
impair diagnostic accuracy [7, 19]. Summarizing our re￾sults did not reveal a predictive value for T2 weighted Im￾aging in this patient cohort.
T2 Mapping in the course of disease
In a subgroup analysis (51% of sAMC patients), we
accomplished follow-up CMR and demonstrated that T2
time was significantly elevated at initial presentation possibly
reflecting acute stage of disease and declined during the
healing process of myocarditis (Fig. 3). In detail, we discov￾ered a significant decrease of T2 values in patients who ex￾perienced recovery, however being still elevated compared
to healthy controls. Recently, Luetkens et al. published simi￾lar results in a small patients cohort. [27] In their study 24
patients with suspected acute myocarditis underwent several
CMR examinations during follow-up. CMR markers of
myocardial inflammation including T1 and T2 relaxation
times demonstrated a rapid and continuous decrease over
time. In the presented study, patients with on-going symp￾toms and persistent cardiac dysfunction displayed persist￾ently elevated T2 values at follow-up, giving rise to a
discriminative value for a CMR-based approach to distin￾guish patients with active myocarditis from healed stages of
disease. These results might be explained by a resolution of
myocardial edema in the majority of patients at follow-up
examination, while those with persistent left ventricular dys￾function may still have suffered from on-going myocardial
inflammation.
Study limitations
Our CMR protocol did not include Early Gadolinium
Enhancement ratio (EGEr) for complete evaluation of
the Lake Louise approach. Although complete Lake
Louise criteria experienced general acceptance as the
reference for CMR-based diagnosis of myocarditis, it has
been reported that omission of EGEr does not alter
overall diagnostic accuracy [28].
Our study included a rather small sample size. How￾ever, we performed a very strict selection process
according to current ESC guidelines. Furthermore 87%
of patients underwent right ventricular EMB, confirming
diagnosis of AMC in 55%.
Another limitation of our study is that LGE was per￾formed eight to ten minutes after gadolinium contrast
injection, which could be not the optimal timing.
Recently, Rodríguez-Palomares et al. emphasized that
timing after contrast injection could be of prognostic
importance in patients with myocardial infarction [29].
Conclusion
Our results suggest that assessment of myocardial T2
relaxation times at initial presentation facilitates CMR￾based risk stratification in patients with acute myocarditis.
Patients with normal T2 values are at low risk for follow￾ing adverse cardiac events. T2 Mapping may emerge as a
new tool to monitor inflammatory myocardial injuries
during the course of disease.
