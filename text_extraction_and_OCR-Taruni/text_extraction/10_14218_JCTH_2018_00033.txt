Abstract
Recurrent acute bacterial cholangitis is a unique indication for
liver transplantation in primary sclerosing cholangitis. We present
the first report on utility of healthy donor fecal transplantation for
management of recurrent acute bacterial cholangitis in a primary
sclerosing cholangitis patient. We demonstrate the striking liver
biochemistry, bile acid and bacterial community changes follow￾ing intestinal microbiota transplantation associated with ameli￾oration of recurrent cholangitis.

Introduction
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare disease with
multiple etiopathogenetic mechanisms that lead to chronic
biliary inflammation and fibrosis of the intra- and/or extra￾hepatic biliary tree, leading to cirrhosis and sometimes
associated with malignancies of the biliary tree. Current
available standard medical therapies do not benefit the
overall survival, and liver transplantation (LT) remains the
only curative therapy.1,2 The gut microbiota has been impli￾cated as a central factor in the pathophysiology of PSC. Tabibian
and colleagues3 demonstrated the importance of commensal
microbiota and its metabolites in protecting against biliary
injury and suggested future directives such as microbiota￾based biomarkers and therapeutic interventions in PSC.
The fact that microbiota plays an important role in the
pathogenesis and as well progression of PSC has been dem￾onstrated through multiple trials that utilized antibiotics, such
as metronidazole and vancomycin, that have effectively shown
to improve liver biochemistry.4 Sabino et al.5 investigated
the gut microbial composition in patients with PSC and dem￾onstrated that PSC had a characteristic microbial signature
that is independent from inflammatory bowel disease. These
data suggest that manipulation of the gut microbiota could
potentially influence the disease process in PSC.
Recurrent acute bacterial cholangitis (BC) in the presence
or absence of dominant strictures and not responding to
intensive medical management is a unique indication for LT
in patients with PSC.2 We present herein novel clinical and
metagenomic data for a patient with recurrent acute BC asso￾ciated with PSC, who was listed for LT and in whom BC epi￾sodes were ameliorated for a year after healthy donor fecal
microbiota transplantation (FMT).
Case report
A 38-year-old non-smoker and teetotaler male diagnosed
with PSC without inflammatory bowel disease (the latter ruled
out by colonoscopy-directed mucosal biopsy at 3 months
prior to current presentation), for 3 years and on ursodeox￾ycholic acid (UDCA) at 15 mg/kg/day had developed three
episodes of BC within the prior 6 months, with the last episode
requiring intensive care unit admission for septic shock. Mag￾netic resonance cholangiography revealed mucosal irregular￾ities in the right and left hepatic duct with areas of beading in
segments 3, 6 and 8 of the liver in the absence of dominant
strictures. Test of immunoglobulin type G4 serum level was
normal, and its associated systemic manifestations were
absent. Level of carbohydrate antigen 19-9 was within normal
limits in the absence of cholangitis, and parenchymal or bile
duct lesions suggestive of cholangiocarcinoma were not evident
on serial follow-up imaging.
In view of the recurrent BC, the patient was listed for LT.
While on the wait list, the patient developed persistent pruritus
(Itch score 6/10) and jaundice lasting for 3 months and
experienced a fourth episode of BC. Two out of three prior
episodes of BC were associated with Escherichia coli bacteremia
sensitive to cephalosporins and carbapenems, respectively. The
recent episode of BC was associated with Enterococcus fecalis
sensitive to linezolid, to which the patient responded clinically.
Considering the high mortality associated with being on an LT
wait list, manipulation of the intestinal microbiota through
healthy donor FMT (to potentially influence the disease process

in PSC)2 was considered, with informed consent from the patient
and his wife. The patient’s nephew was identified as the potential
donor, after standard screening protocol.6
Sixty grams of freshly collected stool sample was obtained
6 hours before the procedure and homogenized in a blender
with 250 mL of normal saline for 2–4 minutes. Two hundred
milliliters of the strained and filtered stool were delivered
through an endoscope to the second part of the patient’s
duodenum. Endoscopic FMT was performed once weekly for
4 weeks. All antibiotics were withheld during this period, but
the UDCA was continued.
Blood biochemistries, total and fractionated serum bile acids
and stool microbial community analyses were performed at
baseline and before each scheduled FMT and at the end of
1 year following the treatment. Microbiome analysis was
conducted on colonic stool samples as per standard protocol.
Briefly, sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiSeq next￾generation sequencer (Illumina, CA, USA) and classified tax￾onomically according to the GreenGenes Database (version
13.8). The Shannon diversity index was used to describe
species diversity in each bacterial community, while Quantita￾tive Insights into Microbial Ecology (QIIME), Phylogenetic
Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved
States (PICRUSt) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
Genomes (KEGG) Pathway were used to ascertain quantitative
and qualitative microbial communities and their respective
functional pathways.7
The patient was afebrile and anicteric after the third and
fourth sessions of FMT, respectively, and remained so up to
1 year. Pruritus worsened up to 6 weeks after the FMT
(maximal score of 8/10), steadily decreasing to tolerable levels
(2/10) thereafter. Notable improvements in liver functions
(Table 1) and circulating total and toxic bile acids (Table 2) asso￾ciated with distinctive modification of bacterial communities and
their functions, from the baseline were noted. Relative abun￾dance of Proteobacteria was higher in the patient at baseline,
while Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria were higher in the
healthy donor. Bifidobacterium, Coprococcus Megamonas and
Bacteroides were higher in the donor at baseline while Enter￾obacter, Catenibacterium and Dialister were noted to be higher
in the patient at baseline. During the period of FMT, striking
changes were seen with reduction in relative abundance of
Proteobacteria and concomitant increase in Bacteroidetes
and Firmicutes. At the genus level, bacteria that were predom￾inant in the donor increased during FMT in the patient (Bacter￾oides, Megamonas, Bifidobacterium) with emergence of species
that were absent at baseline (Clostridium, Veillonella). Some
species that were present at baseline in the patient, were com￾pletely absent at the end of the 4 weeks of FMT (Fecalibacte￾rium, Oscillopsira, Lachnospira).
Pathways associated with membrane transport, especially
ATP-binding cassette transport and proteins associated with
bacterial motility, were modified after FMT (Fig. 1). One year
after FMT, cholangitis recurred (managed with broad spectrum
antibiotics in the absence of blood culture positivity) with
marked pathogenic changes in gut microbial communities
and emergence of pathogenic species that were not evident
at baseline in either the patient or the donor. The patient was
offered a second cycle of FMT but declined and was referred to
an LT center for work-up and relisting on the LT wait list.
Discussion
Healthy donor FMT for PSC has been shown recently to
improve microbiome diversity and liver biochemistries in
PSC.8 Bajer and co-workers9 showed that Rothia, Enterococ￾cus, Streptococcus and Veillonella were markedly overrepre￾sented, while Coprococcus, Adlercreutzia and Prevotella were

reduced in patients with PSC, regardless of concomitant inflam￾matory bowel disease; this was more or less similar to our find￾ings at baseline. Pereira et al.10 suggested that the etiology of
PSC was not associated with changes in bile microbial commun￾ities and that Streptococcus played a potential pathogenic role
in the progression of the disease.
One-year transplant-free survival (TFS) and amelioration of
recurrent acute BC through FMT in PSC has not been demon￾strated. Multiple studies have shown that in patients with PSC,
improvements in serum alkaline phosphatase (spontaneously
or more often with UDCA therapy) lead to better prognosis.
However, larger placebo-controlled studies on UDCA treat￾ment did not demonstrate any effect on symptoms or time to
transplantation. Findings from the largest multicenter study
of PSC with 15-year follow-up supported no role for UDCA in
improving clinical events or TFS. In a recent analysis, an
increased serum concentration of lithocholic acid, a potent
hydrophobic bile acid, in PSC patients given high-dose UDCA
was found to be associated with adverse outcomes and,
hence, UDCA dosing >28 mg/kg was curtailed.10
Antibiotic therapy appears promising in PSC, particularly in
the face of mounting evidence for the recognized role of the
intestinal microbiome in pathogenesis of PSC. But, the issue of
evolving resistance and prevention of disease progression
remains a real concern for clinicians.11 In the patient, cyclic
antibiotics along with UDCA failed to improve acute BC episodes

or liver biochemistries, but the use of FMT improved clinical as
well as liver biochemistry.
In our patient, at the phylum level we see a decrease of
Proteobacteria (a phylum containing numerous human patho￾gens) and an increase of Firmicutes abundance (a phylum with
many taxa, having presumed beneficial immunologic proper￾ties). This would clearly favor FMT in PSC. However, on the
genus level we see an increase of Klebsiella and Enterococcus,
which likely have proinflammatory enteric effects and consti￾tute an important enteric source of pathogens in BC in PSC.
Furthermore, Faecalibacterium and Roseburia, both butyric
acid producing taxa with well-established beneficial immunor￾egulatory effects, are reported to decrease in the patient over
time. But, this has been demonstrated only in patients with
ulcerative colitis and not in those with PSC.12 Nevertheless,
even in the presence of pathogenic bacterial evolution in the
subsequent months after FMT, beneficial metabolic functional
pathways are still active. Hence, the mere presence of patho￾genic species may not truly reflect clinical outcomes, but they
may affect microbiome functionality, which is more important.
The reason behind the spontaneous pathogenic changes in
our patient cannot be clearly explained at this time. The effect
might be secondary to a failure of coinhabitation of beneficial
species in the long term due to other active ‘drivers’ of disease
pathogenesis.13 This would clearly question the beneficial
effect of FMT in PSC, or at least advocate that FMT may be a
useful short term means to extend TFS but not be appropriate
as a long-term solution; it may even may be adverse in the
intermediate to long term. An important finding that supports
the improvement in TFS may be the striking beneficial modu￾lations seen in the circulating bile acids and the initial reduction
in alkaline phosphatase. Spontaneous recovery from episodes
of acute BC in the long term, even though likely, has not been
well demonstrated in the natural history of the disease, and
recurrence of BC is well known to have life threatening out￾comes in patients of PSC.
In our patient, recurrent BC and its amelioration during a
whole year after the FMT with clinical, biochemical and meta￾genomic evidence of improvement and modulation posttreat￾ment is conceptual proof that the symptom-free period and
TFS did not merely arise by chance, even though larger studies
of this matter are required to confirm our findings. The re￾currence of acute BC in the patient after 1 year of FMT seems to
suggest that microbiota may be one of the ‘drivers’ of disease
progression and manifestation; however, other factors may be
associated with initiation and maintenance of dysbiosis in PSC
or benefits of FMT may be finite with short-term use. These
issues require further research, using studies that integrate
multiomics, considering host and environmental factors, to
fully understand the PSC spectrum.
Conclusions
We believe that patients with PSC with recurrent acute BC in
the absence of advanced cirrhosis and decompensation could
benefit from FMT through extension of TFS. This may decrease
the transplant wait list burden, so that proper allocation of
organs to those with higher liver disease severity scores could
be realized. Larger studies are an unmet need.
