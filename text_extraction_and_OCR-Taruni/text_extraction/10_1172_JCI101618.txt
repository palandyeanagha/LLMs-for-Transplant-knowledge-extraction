The efficiency with which diodrast (3, 5-di￾iodo-4-pyridone-1-acetic acid) and hippuran (o￾iodohippuric acid) are excreted by the renal tu￾bules (1, 2) raises the question to what extent
the organically-bound iodine in these molecules is
responsible for the phenomenon of tubular excre￾tion. Since suitable quantitative methods for the
determination of unsubstituted compounds wvere
not available, substituted derivatives of hippuric
acid which could be determined by appropriate
coupling reactions were prepared 2 and studied
under conditions permitting the exact comparison
of renal clearances with those of diodrast atnd
hippuran.
Methods of comparing clearances. When two
substances, both of which are excreted by the
tubules, are presented to the tubular excretory
mechanism simultaneously, one substance may de￾press the tubular excretion of the other (2, 3).3
Consequently, in the absence of information to

preliminary report on this work was given before the
American Physiological Society in 1941 (22).
2We are indebted to Dr. Kenneth C. Blanchard for
the synthesis of o- and p-hydroxyhippuric acid, p-amino￾hippuric acid, 2-pyridone-1 acetic acid, p-aminophenace￾turic acid, and several compounds not reported in this
paper. Subsequently Merck and Company kindly pre￾pared for us m-aminohippuric acid, p-aminomandelic
acid, m-hydroxyhippuric acid, and additional p-amino￾hippuric acid. p-Acetaminohippuric acid and cinnamoyl
glycine were prepared by Mr. John Mulvaney under Dr.
Blanchard's direction. Large quantities of pyrogen-free
20 per cent solution of sodium p-aminohippurate as well
as the anhydrous (reagent) free acid for the prepara￾tion of standard solutions were supplied through the
courtesy of the Medical Research Division of Sharp
and Dohme.
8 That hippuric acid is excreted by the tubules was
indicated in preliminary experiments by the fact that the
intravenous administration of sodium hippurate markedly
depresses the phenol red clearance (without affecting
the filtration rate) in the dog.
the contrary, the comparison of tubular clearances
by the conventional simultaneous method is haz￾ardous since, even if the two clearances are identi￾cal, it is possible that the clearance of one sub￾stance may be depressed by the presence of the
other. Although essential in principle, this pre￾caution has proved to be of minor importance
with most of the compounds studied here, since
"titration" experiments (unpublished), in which
the plasma concentration of one compound is
raised from zero in the presence of a constant
concentration of the other compound, have shown
that diodrast is more effective in depressing the
clearance of p-hydroxyhippuric and p-aminohip￾puric acid than these compounds are in depressing
the diodrast clearance. Consequently we have
designed our experiments so that diodrast was
introduced into the blood after a series of clear￾ance determinations with the hippuric acid deriva￾tives. Thus there are afforded three methods of
calculation:
1. Comparison of successive clearances, wherein
'the clearance (Cx) of that compound (X) with
either negligible or least depressive power is meas￾ured alone in 3 successive 10-minute periods,
followed by a similar 3-period clearance (Cy)
determination of the second compound (Y),
simultaneously with Cx, an interval of 20 minutes
elapsing between the first and second series of
clearances.
In such experiments, the plasma concentration
of X has been maintained at the lowest levels
compatible with analytical accuracy; for o-, m-,
and p-hydroxyhippuric acids this is 2 to 4 mgm.
per 100 ml., for m- and p-aminohippuric acid and
p-acetylaminohippuric acid, 1 to 3 mgm. per 100
ml. Hippuran and diodrast have been used in
plasma concentrations of 1 to 2 mgm. of iodine
per 100 ml. With these plasma concentrations,

it is believed that the diodrast clearance is not
appreciably depressed by the hippuric acid
derivatives.
In this method, precaution must be taken to
insure that the renal blood flow remains as con￾stant as possible throughout the two series of ob￾servations, and that absolute errors in timing and
collection of urine samples are reduced to a mini￾mum. One disturbing physiological factor is ex￾cessive hydration to produce diuresis, which tends
to cause renal hyperemia in the dog. It has been
our experience that the renal plasma flow does
not become constant after excessive hydration
until the urine flow has, fallen to below 3 ml. per
minute (15 kgm. dog) and even then progressive
reduction throughout 5 or 6 periods implies re￾gression of hyperemia. At urine flows below 1.0
ml. per minute, accurate timing and complete col￾lection of urine samples are difficult.
2. All the above errors may be avoided in some
measure by comparing the successive Cx/Ccrl
and CY/CCr2 clearance ratios (Column 8, Table
IV and Column 9, Table V) in the sense
CX/CCrl CY/CCr2 (where Cc,, is the creatinine
clearance in the first 3 periods and CCr2 the cre￾atinine clearance in the second 3 periods). Alter￾natively, the inulin (CIN) or mannitol (Cm) clear￾ance ratio is used for this purpose in man. Here
errors in timing and urine collection affect Cx
and Ccy1 (or Cy and CCr2) equally and hence
cancel out.
Moreover, in the dog the filtration rate, Ccr,
tends to vary with the renal plasma flow, Cx (or
Cy where Cy is approximately equal to Cx), the
filtration fraction Ccr/Cx changing only slightly
with marked changes in Cx. Consequently,
changes in the renal plasma flow tend to be elimi￾nated when one compares the successive clearance
ratios. Indeed, for the dog, we consider this to
be a much more accurate method of comparison
than method 1.
In man, the filtration fraction varies inversely
as the renal plasma flow and the only advantage
of this method, as compared with the preceding
one, is the elimination of timing and collection
errors.
3. Where it is known that X does not depress
the clearance of Y, an adequate concentration of
X may be maintained in the plasma throughout
the determination of the. Cy SQ that there is avail￾able the simultaneous clearance ratio, Cx/Cy, in
the second series of observations. So far as er￾rors, other than possible mutual depression of
clearances are concerned, this is of course the
most accurate method of the three.
Where available, all three ratios are reported
in Tables IV and V.
Blanks in plasma and cells. Because of the
small order of magnitude of the blanks involved
in both plasma and cells, these values were deter￾mined additively: i.e., a known quantity of sub￾stance under determination was added to a suit￾able filtrate of plasma or cells (see Methods) and
the blank determined by difference. Since it is
possible that substances present in plasma filtrates
may inhibit color development, in some instances
at least 3 concentrations were added to aliquots
of the same plasma filtrate and the resulting ap￾parent concentrations plotted against the theoretic
values. If no inhibition of color development is
present, the 3 determinations should fall along a
straight line with a slope of 1.0 and which either
extrapolates through the zero coordinates or to a
positive intercept equal to the value of a constant
blank. (Such inhibition has been observed only
on m-hydroxy hippuric acid as described under
Methods.)
Determination of the blank was, with few
exceptions, carried out in each clearance experi￾ment on any animal or man, and an appropriate
correction applied to the analytical data. A tabu￾lation of these blank values is given in Table I.
The blank values for the p-amino coupling reac￾tion are so small that they can be neglected with
plasma concentrations of 1.5 mgm. per cent or
higher of p-aminohippuric acid, etc.
Blank excretion. Twelve examinations of
timed urine samples from 7 individuals indicate an
excretion rate of chromogenic material behaving
like p-aminohippuric acid, of 0.002 to 0.036 mgm.
per minute (average 0.0083). Since at a plasma
concentration of 2 mgm. per cent and with a
clearance of 600 ml. per minute, UV = 12 mgm.
per minute, this blank can be wholly neglected in
clearance determinations. The identity of the
compound or compounds giving the color reac￾tion is unknown. On acid hydrolysis, the UV
blank increases slightly, but remains at negligible
values. The blank excretion for both "apparent"
free p-aminQhippuric acid and acid-hydrolyzable,

conjugated material is similarly low and negligible
in the dog. The blank excretion of p-phenols
tends to be somewhat larger, but nevertheless can
usually be neglected in both species.
Recoveries were determined in plasma by sub￾stituting 2 ml. of standard solutions of the com￾pound under investigation for 2 ml. of water in
the process of precipitating 2 ml. of plasma. A
similar method was used with cells, the concen￾trated cells being hemolyzed before addition of
the standard solution. The appropriate blank
value determined on the sample of plasma or cells
was deducted in calculating the recovery.
As might be expected, recovery from hemolyzed
cells is less than 100 per cent, but it is neverthe￾less fairly uniform for any one compound. No
consistent difference has been found in the be￾haviour of dog and human plasma and red cells
and the respective figures have been averaged in
Table IL.
In calculating plasma clearances, recovery has
been taken at 100 per cent for all compounds ex￾cept p-hydroxyhippuric acid and diodrast, where
the figures 89 and 94 per cent, respectively, were
used in man (for dog, see Note 11, Table II).
The recovery figures shown in Table II were used
in calculating the in vivo distribution between
red cells and plasma shown in Table III.
From experience, we have found that it is im￾portant, especially when working with relatively
unfamiliar compounds, to include a "blank" and
a "recovery determination" in each set of experi￾mental analyses.

The tendency of all compounds to penetrate
the red cell is much less in man than in the dog,
and indeed no definite penetration was ever dem￾onstrable in man in the case of m-aminohippuric
acid, p-aminohippuric acid, or p-acetylaminohip￾puric acid. The data on p-aminohippuric acid in
Table V include 2 prolonged experiments (11
and 12 periods, respectively) with pyrogenic renal
hyperemia (5), a fairly constant concentration
of the acid being present in the blood for 3 to 4
hours. Despite this prolonged exposure, no de￾tectable quantity of p-aminohippuric acid was
present in the cells. These experiments demon￾state that the increase in diodrast and p-amino￾hippuric acid clearances during pyrogenic hyper￾emia is referable solely to renal hyperemia and
not in any measure to increased extraction of
the compound from the red cell. Indeed, the
general identity of these clearances indicates that
no significant quantity of diodrast moves out of
the red cell during the renal passage of the blood.
Comparison of clearances in the dog. The per￾tinent data on the renal clearances of the sub￾stances studied here are given in Table IV.
Essentially identical clearances are shown by
m-hydroxyhippuric acid, p-hydroxyhippuric acid,
m-aminohippuric acid, p-aminohippuric acid, p￾acetylaminohippuric acid, 2-pridone-1-acetic acid,
cinnamoylglycine, hippuran, and diodrast.
This conclusion would be reached whether one
considered the ratios of successive clearances
(Column 7), the ratio of the successive filtration
fractions (Column 8), or the ratio of the simul￾taneous clearances (Column 9), except in the case
of cinnamoylglycine the clearance of which ap￾pears to be substantially depressed by the presence
in the plasma of p-aminohippuric acid.
It is thus clear that the presence of iodine in
hippuran (o-iodohippuric acid) is not essential to
the process of tubular excretion, but that the
necessary properties are possessed by the parent
hippuric acid molecule. Similarly, 2-pyridone-1-
acetic acid (of which a sufficient quantity for only
2 experiments was available) appears to be ex￾creted as efficiently as is the iodo derivative, iopax
(5-iodo-2-pyridone-1-acetic acid) (6). The iden￾tity of the above clearances conforms with the
premise (7, 2) that the limiting circumstance in
renal excretion of diodrast (or of any one of the
above substances) at low plasma concentrations
is the effective blood flow to the renal tubules
(which supposedly closely approximates the total
renal blood flow 4) rather than a limitation in the
tubular excretory mechanism.
Clearances significantly lower in the dog than
those of diodrast or the above hippuric acid de￾rivatives are shown by o-hydroxyhippuric acid,
p-aminophenaceturic acid, iopax, and p-amino￾benzoic acid. No interpretation suggests itself to
account for the difference in behavior between
o-hydroxyhippuric acid and the p- and m- deriva￾tives or for the behavior of iopax, though pre￾sumably it represents some limitation in the tubu￾lar excretory mechanism. p-Aminobenzoic acid,
when infused at a constant rate, shows a tendency
for the clearance to rise with time, and in 1 experi￾ment where a single injection of p-aminobenzoic
acid was given intravenously and the clearance
was determined in successive periods on a falling
plasma concentration, the clearance rose substan￾tially above that of creatinine. We interpret the
rising clearance as reflecting the formation in the
body of p-aminohippuric acid from p-aminoben￾zoic acid. Similarly, p-aminophenylsuccinic acid
shows a rising clearance starting in excess of the
creatinine clearance, implying metabolism to an
unidentified compound having a high clearance
value.
p-Aminomandelic acid has a clearance very
close to that of creatinine. Whether the discrep￾ancy between the two clearances is attributable
to systematic error in the determination of one
or the other substances or indicates tubular excre￾tion of the acid cannot be said from the available
data. Unfortunately, necessary cessation of work
prevented further examination.
Comparison of clearances in man (Table V) 5.
The same methods of comparison as are described
4 White (4) reports the average diodrast renal extrac￾tion ratio in the dog as 0.74, while Corcoran, Smith and
Page (23) obtained 0.87. More recently Bradley and
his coworkers (personal communication) and Stead and
his coworkers (personal communication) have inde￾pendently observed the renal extraction ratio of dio￾drast in man to averge 0.87. Phillips et al. (24) report
the extraction ratio of p-aminohippuric acid in the
dog to be 0.85.
5 We ake indebted to Dr. William Goldring, Dr. Her￾bert Chasis, Dr. Hilmert Ranges, and Dr. Stanley Brad￾ley for assistance in the observations on man reported
in Table V, and to Miss Martha Barrett and Miss Claire
Lawler for the inulin and mannitol determinations.

Each experiment consists of 2 series of clearance periods; in the first series, the clearance of substance X was ob￾served alone, after which substance Y was introduced (second series). Thus there are available, relative to the inulin
(or mannitol) clearance, the ratio of the successive clearances (column 9), the ratio of the successive filtration fractions
(column 10), and the ratio of the simultaneous clearances (column 11). All clearances have been corrected to 1.73 square

a variety of diseased states, even when the clear￾ance is reduced by hypertensive disease or chronic
glomerular nephritis.
o-Hydroxyhippuric acid shows a clearance sig￾nificantly lower than that of diodrast, but one
which by its magnitude relative to the inulin clear￾ance indicates substantial tubular excretion.
The clearance of p-aminomandelic acid is close
to the filtration rate. Although systematic errors
of a slight magnitude cannot be ruled out, the
deviations between this clearance and that of
inulin, especially in long experiments, indicate
that the process of excretion of this compound is
complex.
It can be said in brief that the human and the
dog kidney respond alike to the compounds stud￾ied here, as is the case with all compounds so
far examined quantitatively except creatinine
(3, 25).
Determination of pK'.6 As a matter of possible
interest in relation to tubular excretion, the dis￾sociation constant of the acidic group of a number
of these compounds was determined by titration
with NaOH and measurement of (- log aH+) by
the glass electrode (see Table VI). In the calcu￾lation, log(aH+) is taken as equal to log(H+) +
logyH+, where -logyH+ in dilute solution is ap￾proximately 0.05. Total anion (A-) is taken as
(H+) + (B+), where (B+) is the equivalent con￾centration of base added. The concentration of
undissociated acid (HA) is taken as (total
acid)-(A-). With these substitutions,
PK'a= pK'.pH + log~(HA) (A-)
The pK'a values are given in Table VI. In the
case of p-aminophenylsuccinic acid, the neutrali￾zation curve is nearly linear beyond (B+)/(HA)
= 0.5, indicating that the two pK"s do not differ
greatly in magnitude, and computation of these
values was not attempted.
pK'a2 was determined in the case of o-hydroxy￾hippuric and m-hydroxyhippuric acids to be 8.40
and 9.26, respectively. The effect of 0.16 M
NaCl was examined in the case of hippuran,

as 0.10.)
There is no correlation between pK'a and the
manner in which these substances are handled
by the kidney. Recognizing that phenol red
(pK' = 7.9) is also abundantly excreted by the
renal tubules in man (8), it appears that within
wide limits the acidic strength has little bearing
on whether a substance will or will not be handled
in this manner.
Determination of filterable p-aminohippurate in
plasma. Attempts were made to measure the
ultrafilterable p-aminohippurate in dog and hu￾man plasma by the collodion bag method previ￾ously used in this laboratory in connection with
studies of phenol red, diodrast, etc. (9), but we
were unable to obtain reproducible results.
(Shannon has adduced evidence that constituents
of parlodion react with aryl amines, possibly by
way of nitration, with the consequence that dialy￾sis experiments with such compounds in parlodion
bags give erratic results. Personal com.) We
then decided to obtain the necessary data directly
in man by following the rate of excretion on a
falling plasma curve, with the plasma concentra￾tion always above the level required to effect
saturation of the tubules. It will be seen from
the following equation
TmpAH=UpAHV-CINPPAHb
that if UpAHV is plotted against CINPPAH, the
points should fall in a straight line (assuming b
397

SMITH, FINKELSTEIN, ALIMINOSA, CRAWFORD, AND GRABER
is constant), the slope of which will be equal to b,
the percentage of PAH in the plasma which is
ultrafilterable (here b corresponds to FW in the
equation of Smith, Goldring, and Chasis (2) ), and
that the intercept on the UPAHV axis will be equal
to TmPAH. In the above calculations, the best
straight line was fitted by the method of least
squares to the data obtained from 8 successive
clearance periods, with the plasma concentration
falling roughly in the range from 100 down to 25
mgm. per cent. The average value thus deter￾mined in 11 subjects was 0.83. This value is
close enough to unity so that changes in b, related
to changes in PPAH in the range of 25 and 100
mgm. per cent, can be neglected in the calculations
of TmPAH, i.e., the average value of 0.83 can be
used with little error in the calculation, as in the
case of diodrast. Unfortunately, we were unable
to examine the effect of plasma protein concentra￾tion on b, but for practical purposes or except in
special studies we believe that neglect of this
factor will result in a negligible error in Tm
calculation.
Conjugation of the p-amino group. The ques￾tion of possible conjugation on the p-amino group
is important since at least one conjugate, p-acetyl￾aminohippuric acid, is also excreted by the tu￾bules; conjugation would occlude the p-amino
position during analysis for p-aminohippuric acid
and any unanalyzed conjugate derivative present
in the plasma during the determination of p￾aminohippuric acid Tm might contribute to satu￾ration of the tubules and thus reduce the Tm
value of the latter. Conjugation would probably
be of no importance with respect to p-aminohip￾puric acid clearance determination since there is
no reason to believe that the conjugate derivative
would interfere with the excretion of p-aminohip￾puric at low plasma levels, while it would not
appear in the analytical method for the latter com￾pound as applied to either plasma or urine.
Twenty-six samples of plasma and 27 samples
of urine, collected during routine determination
of p-aminohippuric acid Tm in man (10), ana￾lyzed by the volumetric flask method (see Meth￾ods), showed no significant amount of conjugated
derivative, the average ratio of free to total acid
being 1.00 for both the blood and urine series.
(The plasma concentration ranged from 31 to 89
mgm. per cent, in some cases increasing, in others
decreasing, at moderate rates during the Tm de￾termination.) It is therefore concluded that dur￾ing the infusion of p-aminohippuric acid in the
concentrations used for Tm determination, the
absolute quantity of material conjugated in the
p-position is so small as to be negligible, relative
to the total quantity undergoing excretion.
However, when a single dose of 1.0 gram of
sodium p-aminohippurate was given orally to a
normal subject and the total urine collected for
6 hours, 65 per cent of the administered material
was conjugated. In 2 subjects during a p-amino￾hippuric acid clearance determination, the extent
of conjugation in 3 urine samples each was 9.9,
12.6, 12.8, and 7.6, 9.1, 11.5 per cent respectively.
It is clear that when the body is not presented
with an overwhelming quantity, the proportion
conjugated is significant. This observation is in
line with the known conjugation of p-amino￾benzoic acid (11, 12) and of sulfanilamide (11,
13, 14) in man.
Examination of dog urine by open tube hy￾drolysis and corrected for blank excretion during
a preliminary period after the intravenous admin￾istration of 200 mgm., showed no appreciable
conjugation. It thus appears that conjugation of
p-aminohippuric acid follows the behavior of p￾aminobenzoic acid (11) and of sulfanilamide (11,
14), in that conjugation of the p-amino group
does not occur in the dog.
Adverse physiological reactions. Five-tenths
of a gram per kgm. of sodium p-aminohippurate
can be given to dogs intravenously by syringe over
a period of 5 to 10 minutes with no adverse reac￾tion. Repeated determinations of clearances and
Tm values have revealed no disturbance of renal
function in dogs examined over several months.
Administration of large quantities to man for Tm
determination is described elsewhere (10).
Use of p-aminohippuric acid for the evaluation
of effective renal blood flow and tubular excretory
mass. In view of the following facts, sodium p￾aminohippurate (PAH) appears to be suitable
for the evaluation of those aspects of renal func￾tion which have hitherto been evaluated by the
use of diodrast:
(a) At low plasma levels, the clearance is iden￾tical with that of diodrast, and hence equally valid
as a measure of the effective renal plasma flow.
398

CLEARANCES OF HIPPURIC ACID DERIVATIVES
(b) The chemical determination is extremely
simple, using reagents available in all clinical labo￾ratories, the method as here described giving
quantitative and easily reproducible values from
suitable plasma filtrates and urine dilutions.
(c) The endogenous plasma and urine blanks
are negligibly small.
(d) It does not penetrate the human red cell
in vivo, even on prolonged infusion, and hence
any possible error attributable to extraction from
the blood cell during passage through the kidneys
is obviated.
(e) It is non-toxic, and can be used for the
evaluation of the tubular excretory mass by the
saturation method.
(f) It is less extensively bound to plasma pro￾teins than is diodrast (FW = 0.83 as compared
with 0.73 for the latter), and hence errors in￾volved in the estimation of the percentage of free
and filterable material in the plasma are of less
practical significance.
A comparison of the maximal rate of tubular
excretion of p-aminohippuric acid (TmPAH) with
the maximal rate of tubular excretion of diodrast
(TmD) in the normal and diseased human kidney
will be presented in a following paper.7
SUMMARY
Methods are described for the determination
of hydroxy- and amino-sabstituted hippuric acid
derivatives in urine and in protein-free filtrates
of plasma. The chromogenic blanks, as given by
these methods, have been determined in protein￾free filtrates from plasma and red cells in dog and
man, and recoveries of the compounds from
plasma and red cells have been determined in both
species. The in vivo distribution between red
cells and plasma of most of the compounds is re￾ported for both species. It is noteworthy that
7 p-Aminohippuric acid Tm has been measured in 3
dogs (FW = 0.87 to 0.92), the ratio of this value over
diodrast Tm determined within an interval of several
weeks and calculated on a molar basis being 1.00, 1.10,
and 0.93. Less reliable data indicate that the molar ratio
of p-hydroxyhippuric acid Tm (FW=0.77 to 0.815) to
diodrast Tm in 3 dogs was 1.18, 0.59, and 0.84. From
conmparative data on man (10), it is clear that a fixed
molar value of Tm for different compouuds is not to be
anticipated in different species, although the molar ratio
in one species appears to be fairly constant.
the human red cell is much less permeable in vivo
to all the compounds studied than is the dog red
cell, and that in no case, even after prolonged infu￾sion, does the cell/plasma distribution ratio (per
unit of water) approach unity.
The plasma renal clearances have been com￾pared in the dog by (a) the ratio of the successive
clearances in two closely following sets of clear￾ance determinations, each comprised of three
clearance periods; (b) the ratio of successive fil￾tration fractions relative to creatinine, inulin, or
mannitol, in these two sets of successive clearance
periods; and (c) the ratio of the simultaneous
clearances.
The clearances of (1) m-hydroxyhippuric acid,
(2) p-hydroxyhippuric acid, (3) m-aminohippuric
acid, (4) p-aminohippuric acid, (5) p-acetyl￾aminohippuric acid, (6) 2-pyridone-1-acetic acid,
(7) cinnamoylglycine, (8) diodrast (3-5 di-iodo￾4-pyridone-1-acetic acid), and (9) hippuran (o￾iodohippuric acid) are essentially identical in the
dog. Only compounds 2, 3, 4, 5, and 9 have
been examined in man, and here too the clearances
are identical. This fact conforms with the prem￾ise that the limiting circumstance in the tubular
excretion of diodrast (or of any one of these sub￾stances) is the available blood flow to the renal
tubules (approximating the total renal blood
flow), rather than a limitation in the tubular ex￾cretory mechanism.
The fact that the clearances of p-aminohippuric
acid, which does not penetrate the red cell in vivo
in man, and of diodrast which does penetrate, are
identical under all conditions, including renal
hyperemia, indicates that no significant quantity
of diodrast moves out of the red cell during the
renal passage of the blood.
The clearances of o-hydroxyhippuric acid, p￾aminophenylaceturic acid, iopax, and cinnamoyl￾glycine in the dog, although greater than the
creatinine clearance, are significantly less than the
clearances of diodrast and substituted hippuric
acids. The o-hydroxyhippuric acid clearance is
similarly lower than the diodrast clearance in man.
This deficiency in clearance is presumably related
to limitations in the tubular excretory mechanism.
The p-aminobenzoic acid clearance in the dog
is initially less than that of creatinine, indicating
tubular reabsorption (plasma binding has not been
studied) but on prolonged infusion, the clearance

rises to high values indicating conjugation to p￾aminohippuric acid.
The p-aminophenylsuccinic acid clearance in
the dog is greater than the creatinine clearance
and increases on prolonged infusion, indicating
metabolism to some substance with a high clear￾ance value.
The clearance of p-aminomandelic acid appears
to be slightly above that of creatinine, in the dog,
and slightly below that of inulin in man. *The
discrepancies, however, are only slightly beyond
the limits of systematic errors in one or the other
analytical procedures.
p-Aminohippuric acid is conjugated in the p￾position in man but not in the dog. The presence
of conjugated material does not interfere with the
use of this compound for clearance determination,
since it does not enter into the analytical method
for either plasma or urine. The absolute quantity
conjugated during p-aminohippuric Tm deter￾mination is so small as to be negligible, and offers
no difficulty in the use of p-aminohippuric acid in
the saturation method for evaluating the total
quantity to tubular excretory tissue.
Since the analytical method for p-aminohippuric
acid is much simpler than that for diodrast, and
since the former compound does not penetrate the
red cell in man and is less extensively bound to
plasma protein than is diodrast, it is recommended
for the evaluation of the effective renal blood flow
and tubular excretory mass. (It must of course
be administered to man as an approximately
neutral, dilute, and sterile solution of the sodium
salt.)
METHODS
Manipulative. It is our custom -to use 2 ml. or larger
samples of plasma for precipitation, and 2 ml. samples
of urine for dilution. A 1.0 ml. pipette is never used
except for the addition of reagents, the exact volume of
,which is not important. Dilutions of urines and stand￾ards are preferably made with pipettes and volumetric
flasks rather than by the addition of water from a bu￾rette. We prefer heavy tipped, pear-shaped blowout
pipettes, made to order in all sizes by E. Machlett and
Sons, New York; if ordinary pipettes are used, they
should be selected by weighing expelled water or mer￾cury. Pipettes are rinsed with water, soaked for 2 to
18 hours in cleaning fluid, rinsed in an automatic pipette
washer, rinsed with alcohol, and dried at room tempera￾ture over night.
Blood samples are centrifuged at once and the plasma
removed and precipitated between successive samples.
In clinical work, the separated plasma is returned to
the analytical laboratory for precipitation, but 2 or 5 ml.
of urine are routinely diluted to 50 in a volumetric flask
and transferred to 25 X 200 mm. tubes, which are stop￾pered and labelled at the bedside, further dilutions being
made in the analytical laboratory.
In dog studies, it is convenient to introduce a retention
needle (No. 19, 2V in., medium bevel, made to order
by Becton, Dickinson and Co.) bearing a locking, blunt
tipped stylet, into the jugular vein and to leave it in
place throughout clearance determination. Clotting can
generally be prevented by wetting the stylet with satu￾rated potassium oxalate solution each time it is removed.
Similar retention needles are useful for repeated arterial
or venous blood samples in man.
Constant intravenous infusions are given into the ear
vein or posterior tibial vein in the dog by means of a
mercury gravity pump comprised of a 125 or 250 ml.
side-arm filter flask, a standardized capillary tip in the
rubber stopper of this flask, a 250 ml. levelling bulb, and
rubber tubing. The capillary tip may be made by grind￾ing back a fairly thick broken pipette tip, fused in a
flame until one can barely blow a jet of air through the
lumen. It should deliver from 0.5 to 1.0 ml. per minute
of mercury when the latter is fed from the mercury
reservoir fixed at a convenient height. One hundred to
150 ml. of infusion are placed in the side-arm flask after
the end of infusion tubing has been fastened at a level
slightly above the top of the flask by a small piece of
adhesive tape. Mercury is then added until the level of
fluid is well above the top of the side arm. The pendant
portion of the infusion tubing is examined to be sure it
is free of *air bubbles. The stopper and capillary tip
attached to the mercury reservoir are hung in a bracket
above the mercury level in the reservoir. All that is
required to start the infusion is to lift the stopper from
its bracket and to insert it tightly into the mouth of the
flask. The infusion tubing between the side-arm flask
and the vein should be of small caliber (%,a in. internal
diameter), in order to reduce the weight on the needle,
but a section of larger gum tubing which can be punc￾tured in order to introduce priming injections, should be
inserted close to the side-arm flask. Introduced slowly,
such priming injections are prevented by pressure from
moving backwards into the flask. All rubber tubing
bearing mercury under pressure must be tightly wired to
glass joints.
Dog infusion needles are made by sweating a brass
collar 2 to 3 mm. over-all diameter and 8 to 10 mm.
long, and ringed at several points, on to No. 19 or 20,
1% inch medium to short bevel hypodermic needles after
cutting off the butts. The small infusion tubing must
have a round lumen of such a size as to slip on to this
collar readily. In starting the infusion, the needle is
wet inside with a drop of oxalate solution and inserted
into the shaved ear vein. With the infusion running,
the infusion tubing is slipped firmly on to the needle and,
while an assistant holds the needle in place, the tubing is
tied over the collar with strong thread. An alternative
method is to insert a small piece of glass tubing in the
400

CLEARANCES OF HIPPURIC ACID DERIVATIVES
infusion tubing, % to % of an inch from the end, which
may now be firmly and permanently placed on the infu￾sion needle. Successful puncture of a vein is revealed
by a flush of blood into the glass segment when the infu￾sion tubing, momentarily occluded, is squeezed and
released.
After venipuncture is completed, the needle is fastened
in the vein by placing a small celluloid strip on the under
side of the ear and slipping a paper clip over the shaft
of the needle and the celluloid strip. The ear is then
folded on its long axis, and wrapped lightly with %
inch adhesive tape, the infusion tubing being similarly
fastened to the ear after looping once to protect the end
from strain. By this method, infusions can be given to
a dog in any position for several hours with rare acci￾dental interruptions. The same vein may be used re￾peatedly. Clotting in the needle may occur if a rise in
venous pressure pushes blood back against the infusion
stream, but it is quickly detected by the escape of a fine
stream of air bubbles if a water seal is floated around
the rubber stopper closing the side-arm flask.
Intravenous infusions in man are given aseptically into
an arm vein, using a 4-inch tunnel clamp to control the
rate, the latter being measured by counting the drops of
a Murphy drip.
In dogs (females), the bladder is catheterized with a
No. 14 or 16 flexible catheter with 4 holes. In man,
appropriate male or female catheters are used. It is
convenient to rinse the bladder of the dog by running in
10 ml. of water from a Folin-Wu 15 ml. pipette; by
expelling the contents into the pipette again a very good
idea can be obtained of the efficiency of emptying. In
man, rinsing is effected by injecting and withdrawing
sterile saline with a sterile syringe.
Precipitation. In earlier work (see footnotes to Ta￾ble I), we used a conventional 1: 5 or 1: 10 trichloro￾acetic acid filtrate, prepared by adding 3 or 8 volumes,
respectively, of water to 1 volume of plasma or hemo￾lyzed cell suspension, followed by 1 volume of 20 per
cent trichloroacetic acid; or a tungstate filtrate prepared
by adding 2 or 7 volumes of water, respectively, to 1
volume of plasma plus 1 volume of 10 per cent Na,WO4,
followed by 1 volume of 0.66 N H2SO. These filtrates
suffered the disadvantage that they did not serve equally
well for all determinations, and consequently the cad￾mium sulfate filtrate was later adopted. This filtrate has
the advantage of supplying a dry, protein-free solution,
useful for many purposes.
Cadmium sulfate-NaOH precipitation (adapted from
Fujita and Iwatake (15).
(a) 34.667 grams 3CdSO4.8H20 plus 169.3 ml. N
H,SO4 made up to 1000 ml.
(b) 1.1 N NaOH.
Plasma (1: 15). To 1 volume of plasma in a 125 ml.
Erlenmeyer flask, add 10 volumes of water and 3 volumes
of (a) and mix; then add 1 volume of (b), close with
a rubber stopper and shake well. After 10 minutes,
centrifuge and decant the supernatant fluid through filter
paper or washed cotton. (If creatinine is to be deter￾mined in this filtrate, washed cotton should be used or
the filter paper should be tested for a chromogenic blank
by the additive method.)
When used for the determination of creatinine, a trace
of cadmium may precipitate from this filtrate on the addi￾tion of alkaline picrate solution; this does not, however,
significantly reduce the alkalinity or retard color dvelop￾ment, and recovery of added creatinine, above the endoge￾nous chromogen as determined by addition of creatinine
to plasma filtrates, is 100 per cent. It has been our
custom to filter through washed cotton (filter paper
should not be used) or to centrifuge the alkaline picrate
solution during the 10-minute interval required for color
development in order to remove the precipitated cadmium.
The above reagents may be used to prepare a 1: 5 fil￾trate by using 1 volume of plasma, 3 volumes of (a),
and 1 volume of (b). In some instances, however, re￾coveries on a 1: 5 filtrate are less than 100 per cent.
Cells. Red blood cells are centrifuged at 3000 r.p.m.
for at least 30 minutes and the supernatant plasma care￾fully removed by a capillary pipette. (In the calculation
it is assumed that the cell mass contains 5 per cent inter￾stitial plasma.) About 1 volume of distilled water,
measured from a burette, is stirred into the cells to
permit decantation, and the mixture is transferred with
minimal washing into a graduated cylinder, and the
volume made up to approximately 2.5 times the volume of
cells taken, as determined by the difference between total
volume in the cylinder and the volume of water added.
The mixture is then well stirred until hemolysis is com￾plete. Without hemolysis, recovery of intracellular con￾stituents may be low. An aliquot of this hemolyzed
suspension is transferred with a wash-out pipette into a
125 ml. Erlenmeyer flask and precipitated by the addition
of 3 volumes of (a) and 1 volume of (b) as above,
with special care for mixing and thorough precipitation
by shaking.
Blanks are determined by adding known quantities of
substrate to appropriate plasma or cell filtrates.
Urines are diluted as nearly as possible to a U/P ratio
of 1.0, and treated like plasma filtrates.
Colorimetric determinations. General. Standard col￾orimeter curves are plotted on semi-logarithmic paper
(Keuffel and Esser No. 358-51) and labelled in respect
to date, reagent number, etc. Plastic tubes can be used
in the p-amino coupling, but glass tubes are generally
preferable for alkaline reagents such as alkaline picrate.
Since it is difficult to maintain a large stock of per￾fectly matched Evelyn colorimeter tubes, it is advan￾tageous to use a pair of matched tubes, both marked
for position in the colorimeter, one for the reagent blank
and one for the unknowns. Hence it is desirable to have
a total volume of at least 12 ml. in the coupling reaction
in order to have enough solution for rinsing. The ad￾herent drop remaining after emptying should be removed
by inverting the colorimeter tube on clean tissue, and the
optically exposed portion of the tube should be wiped
clean with tissue between each sample. The tube should
always be placed in the colorimeter in the same position.
The 100 per cent transmission setting of the galva￾nometer should be made with a complete reagent blank
401

SMITH, FINKELSTEIN, ALIMINOSA, CRAWFORD, AND GRABER
contained in the second matched colorimeter tube, and
this 100 setting (or the corresponding air reading if the
blank is stable) checked frequently during a series of
determinations. The zero setting of the galvanometer
should be checked daily.
In ni case should a plasma blank be used for the 100
setting of the galvanometer. If a plasma blank is pres￾ent, it should be determined additively, as described in
the text, and applied to the recovery determination as
well as to the unknowns. Otherwise large errors may
be introduced by a deficient recovery in plasma precipita￾tion obscured by a compensating plasma blank.
o- and m-Hydroxyhippuric acids. The following
method is a modification of that of Gibbs (16):
(a) Veronal buffer: a 2 per cent sodium veronal solu￾tion adjusted to pH 9.1 with HC1 and NaOH.
(b) 2,6-Dichloroquinonechloroimide solution, 25 mgm.
per cent in absolute alcohol. This solution should be
freshly prepared and centrifuged if not clear. It will
keep for only a few hours.
To 10 ml. of plasma filtrate or diluted urine, add 2
ml. of (a) and 2 ml. of (b), shaking the mixture after
the addition of each reagent. Solution (b) should be
added immediately after (a), since hydroxy acids de￾teriorate rapidly in alkaline solution. A blank of 10
ml. of water is treated in the same manner and used for
the 100 setting of the colorimeter. Maximal absorption
of the indophenol is at 600 mu. but a 635 mu. Rubicon
filter is satisfactory. A series of standards prepared
from 10 ml. samples of 0.05 to 0.30 mgm. per cent solu￾tions of o-hydroxyhippuric acid, or 0.1 to 0.6 mgm. per
cent solutions of m-hydroxyhippuric acid should be pre￾pared each time, using the same alcoholic chloroimide
solution as is used in the unknowns. Maximal color
development is attained in 30 minutes with o-hydroxy￾hippuric acid and in 60 minutes with m-hydroxyhippuric
acid.
When increasing amounts of m-hydroxyhippuric acid
are added to aliquots of the same plasma filtrate, and
the resulting apparent concentrations are plotted against
the concentrations in equivalent aqueous dilutions, the
slope of the curve is 0.82, indicating that there is present
in the filtrate something that uniformly inhibits color
development. This inhibition has been taken in account
in the calculation of both plasma recoveries and clear￾ances of this compound. In addition, there is a small,
positive intercept, indicating a true blank.
p-Hydroxyhippuric acid. This method is based on
that of Arnow (17), and gives somewhat greater color
than does Arnow's procedure.
(a) 20 per cent HgSO4 in 5N H2SO4
(b) 0.2 per cent NaNO2 solution
To 5 ml. of plasma filtrate or diluted urine in a 25 by
200 mm. heavy-walled Pyrex tube, add 7 ml. of a fresh
mixture containing 3 parts of (a) and 4 parts of (b).
Close the tube with a glass tear and immerse in boiling
water for 4% minutes. Cool in water at room tempera￾ture, shake and read on the colorimeter with a 490 mu.
filter, using a blank prepared from 5 ml. of water and
7 ml. of reagent and treated as above for the 100 setting.
The color is stable for at least 1 hour. Although the
standard curve is fairly reproducible, it is desirable be￾cause of the short heating period to include standards
(5 ml. each of solutions containing 0.4 to 4.0 mgm. per
cent) with each lot of unknowns.
m- and p-Aminohippuric acids, p-aminophenaceturic
acid, p-aminophenylsuccinnic acid, p-aminobenzoic acid,
and p-aminomandelic acid. All these compounds couple
satisfactorily in Bratton and Marshall's (18) method for
sulfanilamide. The slight modifications presented here
have, however, proved to be practically advantageous.
(a) 1.2 N HCI
(b) 100 mgm. per cent NaNO2
(c) 500 mgm. per cent ammonium sulfamate
(d) 100 mgm. per cent N-(1-naphyl)ethylenediamine
dihydrochloride
To 10 ml. of plasma filtrate or diluted urine add 2 ml.
of (a) and 1 ml. of (b), and mix the solution; not be￾fore 3 minutes and not after 5 minutes, add 1 ml. of (c)
and mix; between 3 and 5 minutes later, add 1 ml. of
(d) and mix. A blank made of 10 ml. of water treated
in the same manner is used to set the colorimeter at 100.
Solutions are read at any time after 10 minutes, using
a 540 mu. filter.
With p-aminohippuric acid, color development is maxi￾mal in 5 minutes, and the color is quite stable.
A standard curve is set up with 10 ml. samples of
solution ranging in concentration from 0.02 to 0.25 mgm.
per cent of free p-aminohippuric acid, the acid being
dried if necessary at 90° C. overnight before preparation
of the stock solution. The sodium salt is too hygroscopic
to use as a standard. The standard curve is quite repro￾ducible and needs to be rechecked only on rare occasions.
A separate curve, however, should be prepared for each
colorimeter.
The NaNO2 must be prepared fresh every 3 days, the
ammonium sulfamate every 2 weeks; the coupling re￾agent (d) lasts indefinitely if kept in a dark bottle and
in the refrigerator. p-Aminohippuric acid is stable in
plasma filtrates and urines if kept in the ice box.
(Bratton and Marshall (18) recommend a trichloro￾acetic acid filtrate for sulfanilamide, but we have found
this filtrate to be quite unreliable for p-aminohippuric
acid. Although perfect recoveries may be obtained, the
coupling reaction frequently and inexplicably fails to go
forward quantitatively or reproducibly. No such diffi￾culty has ever been encountered with the cadmium sul￾fate filtrate, which gives excellent checks in duplicate
determinations on independent precipitations.)
The chromogenic power of various compounds when
corrected for molecular weight (but not specially dried)
and the time required for maximal color development
are as follows: p-aminohippuric, 100 per cent < 10 min￾utes; m-aminohippuric, 96 per cent, 30 minutes; p￾aminobenzoic, 97 per cent, 20 minutes; p-aminomandelic,
90 per cent, 60 minutes; p-aminophenylsuccinic, 75 per
cent, 90 minutes; p-aminophenaceturic, 83 per cent, 5
hours. In all cases, the color is quite stable.
p-Acetaminohippuric acid. Hydrolysis to p-amino￾hippuric acid is carried out by the addition of 2 ml. of
402

CLEARANCES OF HIPPURIC ACID DERIVATIVES
1.2 N HCl to 10 ml. of filtrate or diluted urine, contained
in graduated narrow test tubes or Folin sugar tubes.
After thorough mixing, the tubes are closed with glass
tears and heated in a boiling water bath for 1 hour.
The tubes are then cooled and the volume made up to
12.5 ml. and the p-aminohippuric acid content deter￾mined as above. If read against the standard p-amino￾hippuric acid curve, prepared as above, correction must
be made for the increased total volume after the addition
of coupling reagents, i.e., the result must be multiplied
by 12.5 + 5/10 + 5 or 1.17.
Recoveries by this method are imperfect, some of the
chromogen being destroyed, perhaps by oxidation.
(Similar imperfect recovery after hydrolysis of p-acetyl￾aminobenzoic acid is reported by Doisy and Westerfeld
(19).) It is therefore preferable to prepare a standard
curve by treating knowns in the manner of unknowns.
Since the extent of loss appears to be fairly uniform in
filtrates and urines, no large error is introduced in clear￾ance determination.
Conjugated p-aminohippuric acid. Since absolute re￾coveries were essential in answering the question of pos￾sible conjugation in the body, the following method,
which appears to be wholly satisfactory, was developed
later in the investigation: 2 ml. of 10 N HCl are added
to suitable aliquots of plasma filtrate or diluted urine in
50 ml. volumetric flasks, made up to volume and mixed.
The solution in the neck is covered with about 1 ml. of
toluene. The flasks are placed in an oven at approxi￾mately 96° C. for 3Y2 hours. After cooling, 10 ml. of
this solution are taken for analysis by the p-amino￾hippuric acid method. p-Aminohippuric acid when
treated in this manner gives 100 per cent recovery, as
compared with analysis of an unheated solution. For
this reason, we believe that recovery of conjugated mate￾rial is essentially complete. (A presumptively pure sam￾ple of p-acetylaminosulfanilamide gave 95 per cent re￾covery by this method.)
Diodrast was determined by Alpert's method (20). In
man, recovery in the 1: 15 cadmium sulfate filtrate aver￾aged 94 per cent (cf. Alpert's paper) but in dog re￾covery averaged so close to 100 per cent that no correc￾tion has been made. Hippuran and iopax were deter￾mined by the fusion method (2). Inulin was used in
quantities sufficient to give plasma concentrations of 80
to 150 mgm. per cent and determined by the macro￾method (2) on a ZnSO4-NaOH filtrate (21). Mannitol
was determined by the method of Smith, Finkelstein,
and Smith (21).
2-Pyridone-1-acetic acid and cinnamoylglycine were de￾termined in cadmium sulfate filtrates by a Hilger medium
two-beam ultraviolet spectrograph with Spekker attach￾ment, using standard procedures. We are indebted to
Dr. Rudolph Naumann for these determinations.
