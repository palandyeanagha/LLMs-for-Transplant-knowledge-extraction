Background. Calciphylaxis is a potentially fatal complication of persistent secondary hyperparathyroidism; its cause 
is still not clear. Unfortunately there is no close relation in severity of clinical picture, serological and pathological al￾teration. For this reason the prognosis is difficult to establish. Administration of sodium thiosulphate may reduce the 
precipitation of calcium crystals and improve the general clinical conditions before surgical parathyroidectomy, which 
seems the only therapeutic approach able to reduce the mortality risk in these patients.
Methods and Results. A 60 year old female patient suffering from End Renal Stage Disease, on haemodialysis from 
2001 due to the onset of haemolytic uremic syndrome, underwent a kidney transplant in April 2008. After transplanta￾tion there was a recurrence of the haemolytic uremic syndrome, with temporary worsening of the graft. Six months 
later there was a definite loss of graft and return to dialysis treatment. On April 2010 a severe systemic calciphylaxis 
related to secondary hyperparathyroidism was diagnosed.
The patient underwent parathyroidectomy but, because of the unimproved clinical picture, treatment with sodium 
thiosulphate was initiated. There was only improvement in cutaneous lesions. The worsening general clinical condition 
of the patient caused death due to general septic complications.
Conclusions. The coexistence of haemolytic uremic syndrome and secondary hyperpathyroidism makes the prognosis 
poor and, in this case, therapy, which counteracts calcium crystals precipitation, has no effect. Preventive parathy￾roidectomy can be considered as the only possible treatment.

INTRODUCTION
Calciphylaxis is an extreme and potentially fatal com￾plication of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) 
whose incidence is assessed between 1 to 4% of patients 
suffering from End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). It is 
characterized by calcification of tunica media of skin 
arteries, subcutaneous fat tissues, visceral organs and 
muscles. These histological features are associated to a 
clinical picture characterized by cutaneous and subcuta￾neous manifestations and by the presence of violaceous 
nodular lesions of the skin that can evolve into tissue ne￾crosis, ulcers that do not heal, and cutaneous gangrene 
(Fig. 1). In advanced stage these lesions may be found in 
internal organs such as heart and lung1
 and consequent 
clinical symptoms.
The death rate for calciphylaxis is about 60-80% and 
depends not exclusively on organ involved in the patho￾logical process but also on the extension of necrotic cu￾taneous lesions, possible sites of bacterial contamination 
that can lead to sepsis.
The extreme variability of symptoms is not clear yet 
and it does not seem related to serum parathormone 
(PTH) levels. It is probably due to calcium-phosphate ra￾tio and individual variables not fully understood such as 
sensitization to PTH receptor, vitamin D levels and hypo￾calcaemia. For the above reasons, it is often very difficult 
to formulate a defined prognosis. Possible therapies that 
can modify the course of the disease are surgical para￾thyroidectomy2-4 which should be performed as soon as 
possible in order to restore physiological PTH levels- the 
administration of drugs for normalizing calcium-phospho-

and Cinacalcet (that acts as a calcimimetic activating the

), 
and technical stratagems such as reducing calcium levels 
in dialysis buffers. 
It is reported that intravenous administration of so￾dium thiosulfate6,7 before surgical parathyroidectomy 
increases the solubility of calcium deposits, reduces dis￾seminated precipitation of calcium crystals and coun￾teracts occlusions in small and medium calibre arteries, 
improving clinical picture acting as antioxidant and cal￾cium binding drug. 
CASE REPORT
We report the case of a 60 year old female patient 
suffering from ERSD, on haemodialysis treatment from 
2001 subsequent to haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), 
and who underwent a kidney transplant from a deceased 
donor on April 2008. Shortly after renal transplant, the re￾lapse of HUS (accompanying with worsening of the graft) 
required plasma-aphaeresis, blood transfusions, and hae￾modialysis. The problem was resolved and graft function 
was resumed up to December 2008 followed by loss of the 
graft when the patient was returned to dialysis treatment. 
On April 2010 the patient came to our attention again 
for the onset of a severe clinical picture of skin lesions,

During hospitalisation a cutaneous biopsy of the skin 
lesions was performed showing deposits of calcium and 
vascular lesions compatible with calciphylaxis (Fig. 2). 
For this reason we started a diagnostic workup monitor￾ing calcium-phosphate metabolism and performing a para￾thyroid ultrasonography and technetium-99m-sestamibi 
scintigraphy that confirmed SHPT, with a PTH level of 
1025 pg/ml (normal range 10-65 pg/ml). 
Parathyroidectomy (Fig. 3), performed using a intra￾operative dosage of PTH (Future Diagnostic STAT-IO-I￾PTH Kit, US), removed the glands leading to a reduction 
of PTH levels of more than 88%, Table1 shows the main 
clinical data regarding bone metabolism before and af￾ter intervention. Histological analysis confirmed that all 
the five glands removed showed signs of hyperplasia9,10. 
Unfortunately, after surgical intervention, the clinical pic￾ture did not improve thus it was decided to initiate therapy 
based on sodium thiosulphate at dosage of 25 grams three 
times a week after dialysis treatment.
The treatment with sodium thiosulphate improved the 
skin lesions but was ineffective in terms of the general 
clinical status, which, instead, worsened because of the 
appearance of septic complications that, although treated 
with aggressive broad-spectrum antibiotics, caused the 
death of the patient.
DISCUSSION
HUS and SHPT have both small and medium calibre 
arteries as targets: their coexistence is considered a nega￾tive prognostic factor particularly when the SHPT is as￾sociated to myelofibrosis11. The role of metastatic calcium 
deposits in vessels, causing a complex hypersensibility 
reaction, plays probably the main role in progression of 
the disease particularly when associated with the onset of 
a thrombotic micro-angiopathy related to HUS. In such a 
clinical picture the administration of sodium thiosulphate 
is insufficient to counteract the deleterious effect of ecto￾pic precipitation of calcium crystals. 
CONCLUSIONS
Calciphylaxis has a high mortality rate. Its pathogen￾esis is still not clear because only few patients suffering 
from SHPT develop such a complication and, further, 
there is no correlation between clinical picture and lab 
tests such as those evaluating calcium-phosphate ratio. 
Probably a main role is played by underestimated pre￾existing vascular alterations that lead to calcium deposits. 
Published data show that the presence of supernumerary 
glands is associated to pathologies causing thrombotic 
lesions; in the light of the above considerations, we be￾lieve that HUS should be considered a negative prognostic 
factor. Moreover, the appearance of skin lesions on the 
proximal side of the upper and lower limbs is related to a 
higher mortality rate12. 
We conclude that, in absence of tools for risk strati￾fication for these patients, the therapy of choice is a 
preventive parathyroidectomy before the appearance of 
advanced lesions.
