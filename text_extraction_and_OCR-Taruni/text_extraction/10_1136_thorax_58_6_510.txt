Abstract
Background: A study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that
patients respond better to lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) if
their emphysema is confluent and predominantly located in the
upper lobes.
Methods: A density mask analysis was used to identify voxels
inflated beyond 10.2 ml gas/g tissue (−910 HU) on preoperative
and postoperative CT scans from patients receiving LVRS. These
hyperinflated regions were considered to represent emphysematous
lesions. A power law analysis was used to determine the
relationship between the number (K) and size (A) of the
emphysematous lesions in the whole lung and two anatomical
regions using the power law equation Y=KA−D.
Results: The analysis showed a positive correlation between the
change in the power law exponent (D) and the change in exercise
(Watts) after surgery (r=0.47, p=0.03). There was also a negative
correlation between the power law exponent D in the upper region
of the lung preoperatively and the change in exercise following
surgery (r=−0.60, p<0.05).
Conclusions: These results confirm that patients with large upper


lobe lesions respond better to LVRS than patients with small
uniformly distributed disease. Power law analysis of lung CT scans
provides a quantitative method for determining the extent and
location of emphysema within the lungs of patients with COPD.
