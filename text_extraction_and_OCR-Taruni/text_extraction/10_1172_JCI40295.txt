Fibroblasts, which are the most numerous celltype in the heart, interact with cardiomyocytes in vitro and affect
their function; however, they are considered to play a secondary role in cardiac hypertrophy and failure. Here
we have shown that cardiac fibroblasts are essential for the protective and hypertrophic myocardial responses
to pressure overload in vivo in mice. Haploinsufficiency ofthe transcription factor–encoding gene Krüppel-like
factor 5 (Klf5) suppressed cardiac fibrosis and hypertrophy elicited by moderate-intensity pressure overload,
whereas cardiomyocyte-specific Klf5 deletion did not alter the hypertrophic responses. By contrast, cardiac
fibroblast–specific Klf5 deletion ameliorated cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, indicating that KLF5 in fibro￾blasts is important for the response to pressure overload and that cardiac fibroblasts are required for cardio￾myocyte hypertrophy. High-intensity pressure overload caused severe heartfailure and early death in mice with
Klf5-null fibroblasts. KLF5 transactivated Igf1 in cardiac fibroblasts, and IGF-1 subsequently acted in a para￾crine fashion to induce hypertrophic responses in cardiomyocytes. Igf1 induction was essential for cardiopro￾tective responses, as administration of a peptide inhibitor of IGF-1 severely exacerbated heart failure induced
by high-intensity pressure overload. Thus, cardiac fibroblasts play a pivotal role in the myocardial adaptive
response to pressure overload, and this role is partly controlled by KLF5.Modulation of cardiac fibroblastfunc￾tion may provide a novel strategy for treating heart failure, with KLF5 serving as an attractive target.
Introduction
Myocardial hypertrophy is an essential adaptive process through 
which the heart responds to various mechanophysical, metabolic, 
and genetic stresses. However, the hypertrophy induced by sus￾tained overload eventually leads to contractile dysfunction and 
heart failure through mechanisms that remain poorly understood 
(1). In addition to enlargement of individual cardiomyocytes, the 
hypertrophied myocardium exhibits complex structural remodel￾ing that involves rearrangement of the muscle fibers, interstitial 
fibrosis, accumulation of extracellular matrix, and angiogenesis 
(2, 3), which implies that the non-muscle cells residing in the inter￾stitium likely play important roles in both cardiac hypertrophy 
and heart failure. In fact, cells other than cardiomyocytes account 
for approximately 70% of the total cell number in the heart, with 
the majority being fibroblasts (4, 5). In addition to extracellular 
matrix proteins (e.g., collagens), cardiac fibroblasts produce a vari￾ety of growth factors that likely mediate an interplay between car￾diac fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes. For instance, several humoral 
factors secreted by cardiac fibroblasts, including cardiotrophin-1 
(6), endothelin-1 (7), IL-6 (8), periostin (POSTN) (9), and leukemia 
inhibitory factor (10), have been shown to induce hypertrophic 
responses in cultured cardiomyocytes. Cardiac fibroblasts also 
promote proliferation of cardiomyocytes through paracrine inter￾actions in developing hearts (11). And very recently it was shown 
that inhibition of a fibroblast-selective miRNA ameliorated car￾diac fibrosis, hypertrophy, and dysfunction, suggesting that fibro￾blasts play a detrimental role in cardiac remodeling (12). Still, the 
precise function of cardiac fibroblasts during adaptive responses 
of the myocardium remains unclear (2).
Members of the Krüppel-like factor (KLF) family of transcrip￾tion factors are important regulators of development, cellular 
differentiation and growth, and the pathogenesis of various dis￾eases, including cancer and cardiovascular disease (13). We previ￾ously used Klf5+/– mice to show that KLF5 is required for cardiac 
hypertrophy and fibrosis in response to continuous infusion of 
angiotensin II (AII) (14, 15). In primary cultured cardiac fibro￾blasts, KLF5 directly controls transcription of Pdgfa, encoding 
platelet-derived growth factor A (PDGF-A) (14), which is known 
to be involved in tissue remodeling and wound healing (16–19). 
The precise role played by KLF5 in cardiac hypertrophy and heart 
failure remains unclear, however.
In the present study, we developed conditional Klf5-knockout 
mouse lines to examine the cell type–specific functions of KLF5 
in cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. While cardiomyocyte￾specific deletion of Klf5 did not alter the hypertrophic responses

to pressure overload, cardiac fibroblast–specific deletion of Klf5
ameliorated cardiac hypertrophy in a moderate-intensity pressure 
overload model, indicating that fibroblasts are essential for hyper￾trophic responses of the myocardium. Notably, however, cardiac 
fibroblast–specific Klf5-knockout mice developed severe heart fail￾ure when subjected to high-intensity pressure overload, suggesting 
cardiac fibroblasts have a cardioprotective function. We further 
demonstrated that KLF5 controls expression of IGF-1, which 
mediates the interplay between cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts. 
These data provide compelling evidence that cardiac fibroblasts 
play a pivotal role in the adaptive response of the myocardium.
Results
KLF5 plays an important role in pressure overload–induced cardiac hyper￾trophy. To analyze KLF5’s function in cardiac adaptive responses, 
we first established models of pressure overload–induced car￾diac hypertrophy using transverse aortic constriction (TAC). 
By applying a low-intensity TAC (LI-TAC) for 2 weeks, we were 
able to induce cardiac hypertrophy with preserved cardiac sys￾tolic function, while application of high-intensity TAC (HI-TAC) 
induced severe myocardial dysfunction and LV dilation (Supple￾mental Figures 1 and 2; supplemental material available online 
with this article; doi:10.1172/JCI40295DS1). The survival rates in 
the LI- and HI-TAC groups were 100% and 90%, respectively, after 
2 weeks, which suggests that the LI-TAC model induces adaptive 
hypertrophy, while in the HI-TAC model, the adaptive response 
fails to protect against the severe pressure overload and enable 
maintenance of cardiac function.
When we examined the involvement of KLF5 in cardiac hypertro￾phy using the LI-TAC model, we found that cardiac expression of 
KLF5 was increased by LI-TAC (Supplemental Figure 3) and that 
LI-TAC–induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis was diminished 
in Klf5+/– mice (Figure 1 and Supplemental Figure 4). Moreover, 
expression of 4 fibrosis-related genes, Col1a1, Fn1, Ctgf, and Spp1, was 
significantly suppressed in Klf5+/– mice (Supplemental Figure 4). 
Thus KLF5 appears to play a critical role in pressure overload–
induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis.
Cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of Klf5 does not affect pressure overload–
induced cardiac hypertrophy. We found that Klf5 is mainly expressed 
in fibroblasts (Supplemental Figure 3C), which suggests that its 
function in fibroblasts might contribute to the phenotypes seen in 
Klf5+/– mice. To test this idea, we generated several conditional Klf5-
knockout mouse lines (Supplemental Figure 5). Homozygous Klf5-
floxed (Klf5fl/fl) mice appeared normal, and expression of Klf5 was 
unaltered (data not shown). The Klf5fl/fl mice were then crossed with 
cardiomyocyte-specific Cre transgenic mice (αMHC-Cre) (20). In 
cardiomyocytes from adult cardiomyocyte-specific Klf5-knockout 
(Klf5fl/fl;αMHC-Cre) mice, which were homozygous for both floxed 
Klf5 and the αMHC-Cre transgene, approximately 70% of the Klf5
gene was deleted (Supplemental Figure 6). When Klf5fl/fl;αMHC-Cre
mice and control Klf5fl/fl mice were subjected to LI-TAC, there were 
no differences in cardiac structure or function, or gene expression, 
between the 2 groups (Figure 2 and Supplemental Figure 7), which 
means that the level of Klf5 deletion obtained in Klf5fl/fl;αMHC-Cre
mice did not affect the hypertrophic response to TAC.
Cardiac fibroblast–specific deletion of Klf5 reduces hypertrophic and 
fibrotic responses. We then analyzed the function of KLF5 in cardiac 
fibroblasts using a transgenic mouse line in which Cre recombi￾nase was driven by a 3.9-kb mouse Postn promoter (21, 22), which 
is restricted to the non-myocyte lineage in the neonatal heart 
(P. Snider and S.J. Conway, unpublished observations). Periostin, 
which is encoded by Postn, is not normally expressed in either the

normal or pathological cardiomyocyte lineage (23), but is induced 
in cardiac fibroblasts by TAC (9, 24, 25). The activity of Cre 
recombinase in the Postn-Cre mice was examined after they were 
crossed with R26RstoplacZ indicator mice (26). Although only a few 
β-galactosidase+ cells were found in the heart under basal condi￾tions, LI-TAC induced robust lacZ expression in fibrotic areas in 
hearts from R26RstoplacZ;Postn-Cre mice (Figure 3A and Supple￾mental Figure 8). As expected, lacZ expression was not detected in 
either cardiomyocytes or ECs (Supplemental Figure 8).
We then used flow cytometry to further analyze expression of 
β-galactosidase in populations enriched in either cardiomyo￾cytes or non-myocytes isolated from R26RstoplacZ;Postn-Cre mice 
subjected to LI-TAC (Supplemental Figure 9). β-Galactosidase+
cells were not found in the cardiomyocyte population. Moreover, 
β-galactosidase+ cells isolated from the non-myocyte population 
expressed a fibroblast-specific marker, discoidin domain receptor 2 
(Ddr2), but not the cardiomyocyte-specific marker αMHC (Myh6) 
or the endothelial marker VE-cadherin (Cdh5), which supports the 
notion that β-galactosidase+ cells are fibroblasts.
Klf5fl/fl mice were then bred with the Postn-Cre mice to generate 
Klf5fl/fl;Postn-Cre mice. These animals were born with no appar￾ent abnormalities and were healthy into adulthood. To examine 
the efficacy of Cre-mediated deletion of Klf5 in each cell type, 
we isolated cardiomyocytes, cardiac fibroblasts, and ECs from 
adult mice. Cardiomyocytes were isolated using the Langendorff 
perfusion method (27). Fibroblasts and ECs were sorted from 
non-myocyte-enriched cell populations using anti-Thy1 antibody 
for fibroblasts (11, 28) and anti-CD31 for ECs. Because Thy1 is 
also expressed in T lymphocytes, CD3– cells were analyzed for sur￾face expression of Thy1 and CD31 (Figure 3B). When the mRNA 
expression of cell type–specific lineage markers was analyzed, 
Myh6 was found to be expressed only in cardiomyocytes, 
while Ddr2 was expressed only in Thy1+CD31–CD3– cells 
and Cdh5 only in Thy1–CD31+CD3– cells (Figure 3C), 
which indicates that Thy1+CD31–CD3– cells were fibro￾blasts. Approximately 72% of the Klf5 gene was deleted in 
Thy1+CD31–CD3– fibroblasts isolated from Klf5fl/fl;Postn￾Cre mice subjected to LI-TAC for 2 weeks, whereas only 
4% was deleted in the sham-operated mice (Figure 3D). 
No Klf5 deletion was observed in cardiomyocytes or ECs. 
Moreover, Cre mRNA was selectively expressed in Thy1+
fibroblasts, as was endogenous Postn mRNA, which is con￾sistent with fibroblast-specific Cre-mediated deletion by 
Postn-Cre (Supplemental Figure 10).
We further analyzed expression of Klf5 mRNA in each 
cell type in mice subjected to either the sham operation 
or LI-TAC (Figure 3E). In sham-operated hearts, levels 
of Klf5 expression were higher in Thy1+ fibroblasts than 
in cardiomyocytes or ECs and did not differ between Klf5fl/fl and 
Klf5fl/fl;Postn-Cre mice. LI-TAC markedly increased Klf5 expression 
in fibroblasts (approximately 4-fold) and moderately increased it 
in cardiomyocytes in Klf5fl/fl mice. While Klf5 expression was clearly 
reduced in fibroblasts from Klf5fl/fl;Postn-Cre, as compared with 
Klf5fl/fl mice, it was not altered in cardiomyocytes, which is again 
consistent with fibroblast-specific deletion of Klf5.
LI-TAC induced less cardiac interstitial fibrosis in Klf5fl/fl;Postn-Cre
mice than in control Klf5fl/fl mice, as expected (Figure 4, A–C), and 
expression of fibrosis-related factors such as Col1a1, Fn1, Ctgf, and 
Spp1 was reduced (Supplemental Figure 11A). In addition to fibrosis, 
increases in heart weight/body weight ratios, echocardiographic LV 
wall thickness, and cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area were smaller 
in Klf5fl/fl;Postn-Cre mice than Klf5fl/fl mice (Figure 4, D–F). Moreover, 
expression levels of hypertrophy-related genes such as Nppa, which 
encodes atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), and Myh7, which encodes 
β–myosin heavy chain, were lower in Klf5fl/fl;Postn-Cre than Klf5fl/fl mice 
(Figure 4G), indicating suppression of hypertrophic responses. These 
phenotypes clearly demonstrate that not only is KLF5 expressed in 
cardiac fibroblasts essential for fibrosis, it is also important for medi￾ating subsequent cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.
IGF-1 controlled by KLF5 mediates hypertrophic responses. We next 
investigated the mechanisms by which KLF5 expressed in fibro￾blasts controls hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes. Because earlier 
studies have suggested there are paracrine interactions between 
cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts (2, 3), we hypothesized that KLF5 
might directly control the expression of paracrine factors in fibro￾blasts. To test that idea, we cultured cardiomyocytes in medium 
conditioned by cardiac fibroblasts transfected with either siRNA 
against KLF5 (29) or control siRNA (Figure 5A). We found that 
the medium conditioned by KLF5 knockdown fibroblasts was

less able to induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and ANP secretion 
than medium conditioned by control cells (Figure 5, B–D), sug￾gesting that, in fibroblasts, KLF5 does indeed control production 
of paracrine factors that induce hypertrophic responses in cardio￾myocytes. Similarly, Thy1+ cardiac fibroblasts 
isolated from Klf5fl/fl;Postn-Cre mice subjected to 
LI-TAC were less able to induce cardiomyocyte 
hypertrophy than Thy1+ cells from Klf5fl/fl mice 
(Supplemental Figure 12).
To identify the paracrine factor genes targeted 
by KLF5, we compared genome-wide gene expres￾sion profiles for the left ventricle in wild-type 
mice subjected to the sham operation and those 
subjected LI-TAC; and in Klf5fl/fl and Klf5fl/fl;Postn￾Cre mice subjected to LI-TAC (Supplemental 
Table 1). Thereafter, expression levels were veri￾fied by real-time PCR. We screened for genes 
encoding secreted proteins whose expression 
levels were significantly increased by LI-TAC in 
wild-type mice and were lower in Klf5fl/fl;Postn-Cre
than Klf5fl/fl mice. Among the 11 genes that met 
these criteria, 6 were preferentially expressed in 
cardiac fibroblasts, as compared with cardio￾myocytes (Supplemental Table 1), and included 
2 growth factor genes, Igf1 and Tgfb3, encoding 
IGF-1 and TGF-β3, and Postn, encoding perios￾tin. While knocking down KLF5 significantly 
reduced expression of Igf1 in cultured fibro￾blasts (Figure 6A), expression levels of Tgfb3 and 
Postn were not altered (Supplemental Figure 
13), suggesting that KLF5 might directly con￾trol Igf1 transcription. Moreover, Igf1 expression 
was highly enriched in fibroblasts (Figure 6B). 
IGF-1 reportedly promotes cardiac growth and 
improves cardiac function in patients with LV 
dysfunction and advanced heart failure (30–32). 
We therefore further analyzed Igf1 as a likely 
downstream target of KLF5.
We found that upregulation of myocardial Klf5
expression after LI-TAC preceded the induction of 
Igf1 (Figure 6C). Levels of both Klf5 and Igf1 expres￾sion were reduced in Klf5fl/fl;Postn-Cre mice, as com￾pared with those in Klf5fl/fl mice, during the 2-week 
observation period following the LI-TAC opera￾tion. The Igf1 promoter contains a KLF-binding 
motif (CCCCACCCAC) at –53 bp, which, in the 
rat, is reportedly important for promoter activity 
and bound by an as-yet-unidentified transcription 
factor (Figure 6D) (33). Reporter analysis of the 
Igf1 promoter showed that KLF5 transactivated 
this promoter, but KLF15, which is expressed in 
cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts (34, 35), 
failed to do so, and mutation within the poten￾tial KLF5-binding motif abolished KLF5-depen￾dent transactivation (Figure 6D). ChIP assays 
confirmed that KLF5 bound to the Igf1 promoter 
(Figure 6E). As reported (30–32), IGF-1 induced 
hypertrophy in cultured cardiomyocytes (Supple￾mental Figure 14A), and inhibition of IGF-1 using 
a neutralizing antibody significantly suppressed 
cardiomyocyte hypertrophy induced by the fibroblast-conditioned 
medium (Figure 6F). Taken together, the results so far demonstrate 
that KLF5 directly regulates expression of Igf1, which appears to be 
a major cardiotrophic factor secreted by fibroblasts.

We also found that the numbers of fibroblasts positive for 
BrdU incorporation following LI-TAC were significantly smaller 
in Klf5fl/fl;Postn-Cre hearts than Klf5fl/fl hearts (Supplemental 
Figure 11B), which suggests that KLF5 may also be involved 
in modulating fibroblast proliferation, either autonomously 
(36–38) or by regulating autocrine/paracrine factors. Consistent 
with the latter, we found that IGF-1 induces fibroblast prolifera￾tion (Supplemental Figure 14B).
We previously reported that KLF5 also controls Pdgfa, which 
encodes PDGF-A, in response to angiotensin II (14, 39). At the 
same concentrations, PDGF-A was less able to induce cardiomyo￾cyte hypertrophy than IGF-1 (Supplemental Figure 14A), though 
PDGF-A and IGF-1 similarly induced fibroblast proliferation 
(Supplemental Figure 14B). PDGF-A induced greater migration of 
fibroblasts in Boyden chamber assays than IGF-1 (Supplemental 
Figure 14C), suggesting PDGF-A is primarily involved in mediat￾ing the migration and proliferation of fibroblasts. Thus, among 
the paracrine factors controlled by KLF5, it appears to be a change 
in IGF-1 activity that is primarily responsible for the reduced car￾diac hypertrophy observed in LI-TAC Klf5fl/fl;Postn-Cre hearts.

Cardiac fibroblasts are essential for adaptive responses to severe pressure 
overload. Next we assessed the importance of cardiac fibroblasts 
in the adaptive responses of the myocardium for maintenance of 
cardiac function. Klf5fl/fl and Klf5fl/fl;Postn-Cre mice were subjected 
to HI-TAC, which we previously found to induce cardiac dysfunc￾tion within 2 weeks (Supplemental Figures 1 and 2). After 10 days 
of HI-TAC, Klf5fl/fl;Postn-Cre mice were visibly emaciated, and their 
body weights were correspondingly diminished (data not shown). 
In addition, mortality among Klf5fl/fl;Postn-Cre mice was significant￾ly higher than among Klf5fl/fl mice after 14 days of HI-TAC (Figure 
7A). Pulmonary edema and/or hemorrhage were noted in most 
of the dead Klf5fl/fl;Postn-Cre mice, and even in those that survived, 
lung weights were significantly increased due to pulmonary con￾gestion and alveolar edema (Figure 7, B and C). Many Klf5fl/fl;Postn￾Cre mice also exhibited shallow, rapid breathing characteristic of 
heart failure. Nonetheless, cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis were 
markedly attenuated in Klf5fl/fl;Postn-Cre mice, though LV luminal 
diameters were markedly increased (Figure 7, D–G). Because of the 
fragility of Klf5fl/fl;Postn-Cre mice, systematic echocardiographic 
analysis could not be performed, as even a minimum dose of anes￾thetic was lethal. However, the 1 Klf5fl/fl;Postn-Cre mouse that sur￾vived the anesthesia showed marked LV dilation and diminished 
systolic function (Figure 7H). Apparently, expression of KLF5 by 
cardiac fibroblasts is necessary for the adaptive and protective 
activities that take place within the myocardium in response to 
severe pressure overload.
Finally, we tested whether IGF-1 is required for the cardioprotec￾tive responses to pressure overload by using JB1, a peptide IGF-1 
receptor antagonist, to inhibit IGF-1 signaling in vivo (40). JB1 
did not affect survival, cardiac function, heart weights, or car￾diac histology in sham-operated control mice (data not shown). 
In mice subjected to HI-TAC, by contrast, JB1 administration led 
to the emaciation and shallow, rapid breathing characteristic of 
heart failure as well as early death (Figure 8A). In JB1-treated mice 
subjected to HI-TAC, the lung weights were significantly increased 
(Figure 8, B and C), cardiac hypertrophy was attenuated (Figure 8, 
D–F), and the left ventricle was significantly enlarged (Figure 8, 
D and F). Moreover, systolic function was impaired more than in 
vehicle-treated mice (Figure 8F), indicating that JB1 exacerbated 
the heart failure. IGF-1 secreted from cardiac fibroblasts thus 
appears to be a crucial mediator of the cardioprotective response 
to severe pressure overload.
Discussion
The results of the present study clearly demonstrate that cardiac 
fibroblasts play essential roles in cardioprotection and cardio￾myocyte hypertrophy, at least in part by producing paracrine fac￾tors, including IGF-1. Based on the observation that in addition 
to extracellular matrix proteins, cardiac fibroblasts produce a 
variety of paracrine factors — some of which can induce hyper￾trophic responses in vitro — it has been postulated that an inter￾play between cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts is involved in cardiac 
hypertrophy and pathology (2, 3). However, the potential require￾ment for fibroblasts in the cardiac response to pathological stress 
in vivo has not been fully appreciated. Our study provides clear evi￾dence that cardiac fibroblasts functionally contribute to the adap￾tive response to pressure overload in vivo. Particularly noteworthy 
is our finding that cardiac fibroblasts are absolutely required for 
protection of cardiac function in severe pressure overload. This 
means that cardiac fibroblasts are not mere bystanders acting only 
in fibrosis, but are crucial mediators of myocardial hypertrophy 
and adaptive responses in the heart. It was recently suggested 
that inappropriate angiogenesis plays an important role in heart 
failure (41). That finding, together with those summarized here, 
highlights the importance of the activities of the non-muscle cells 
residing in the myocardial interstitium. In addition to contribut￾ing to pathological remodeling, it is likely that these cells mediate 
homeostatic responses to physiological stress.
Our findings also indicate that KLF5 expressed in cardiac fibro￾blasts is a key regulator controlling the stress response in the 
myocardium. Moreover, the results obtained with cardiac fibro￾blast–specific Klf5-knockout mice suggest that IGF-1 produced by 
fibroblasts is also important for protective responses. These find￾ings are consistent with the results of earlier studies of the effects

of transgenic overexpression of IGF-1 and IGF-1 receptor in cardio￾myocytes, which were also suggestive of IGF-1’s role in physiologi￾cal hypertrophy and cardiac protection (42–46). Thus IGF-1 pro￾duced locally by fibroblasts appears to be a key mediator of cardiac 
hypertrophy and myocardial protection against pressure overload.
The present study identified Igf1 as the target of KLF5 in fibro￾blasts involved in the cardiac adaptive response. However, KLF5 
also likely controls the expression of genes other than Igf1 and 
Pdgfa, including those encoding paracrine factors involved in regu￾lating fibroblast function (Supplemental Table 1). We would there￾fore expect future studies of the gene networks controlled by KLF5 
in cardiac fibroblasts to shed additional light on their homeostatic 
and pathological functions. In that regard, it will also be important 
to analyze the possible interplay between KLF5 and other members 
of the KLF family. Previous studies have demonstrated the func￾tional roles played by several KLFs in the heart (34, 35, 47, 48). For 
instance, KLF15 negatively regulates cardiac fibrosis (34). It is there￾fore conceivable that networks of KLFs contribute to the myocar￾dial responses to stress. Finally, our results suggest that therapeutic 
modulation of cardiac fibroblast function may represent a novel 
approach to the prevention and/or treatment of heart failure.
Methods
For experimental procedures not described herein, see Supplemental 
Methods.
Animals. Mice were housed in temperature-controlled rooms with a 12-hour 
light/12-hour dark cycle. All experiments were approved by the University of 
Tokyo Ethics Committee for Animal Experiments and strictly adhered to the 
guidelines for animal experiments of the University of Tokyo.
Generation of Klf5-floxed mice. A 12-kb Klf5 fragment containing exons 1–3 
was used to construct the targeting vector. The scheme for construction of 
the targeting vectors is shown in Supplemental Figure 5. The targeting con￾struct was introduced into ES cells by electroporation, and G418-resistant 
clones were then examined for homologous recombination using Southern 
blot analysis with appropriate 3′ probes. Six ES clones that contained the 
correctly targeted Klf5 locus were obtained, and 2 were injected into 129/Sv 
blastocysts to obtain chimeric mice. Male chimeras were bred with female 
transgenic mice expressing the enhanced site-specific recombinase FLP 
to remove the FRT-flanked neomycin cassette to generate heterozygous 
floxed Klf5 (Klf5fl/+) mice. Klf5fl/+ mice were then backcrossed with C57BL/6 
mice using the marker-assisted speed congenic method (49). The mice 
were genotyped by Southern blot analysis or PCR. Southern blot analy￾sis was performed after HindIII digestion using a 396-bp PCR-amplified

in Figure 5A. *P < 0.01 versus siCntrl. (B) Fibroblast-selective expression of Igf1. Igf1 mRNA levels in cultured cardiac fibroblasts were normal￾ized to those of 18s rRNA and then further normalized with respect to those in cardiomyocytes. *P < 0.01 versus cardiomyocytes. (C) Cardiac 
expression of Klf5 and Igf1 mRNA after LI-TAC in Klf5fl/fl and Klf5fl/fl;Postn-Cre mice. Expression levels were normalized to those of 18s rRNA 
and then further normalized with respect to those in the hearts before TAC. (D) Reporter analysis of KLF5-depedent transactivation of the Igf1
promoter. Luciferase reporter constructs driven by the wild-type Igf1 promoter or a mutant promoter in which the potential KLF-binding site was 
mutated were cotransfected with either empty vector or a vector harboring Klf5 or Klf15. Data are representative of 3 independent experiments. 
(E) ChIP assays of KLF5 binding to the Igf1 and Pdgfa promoters. An intronic region of Igf1 that does not contain a KLF-binding motif served as 
a negative control. (F) Effects of neutralizing IGF-1 on the cardiotrophic activity of fibroblast-conditioned medium. An antibody against IGF-1 (30 
μg/ml) or normal IgG was added to the conditioned medium, after which the effect of the medium on cardiomyocyte surface area was analyzed.

probe for hybridization (Supplemental Figure 5). The probe for intron 1 
was made by PCR using primers 5′-TGTCGTGGTGCTTTGAGAAG-3′ and 
5′-TATCTTCCAGGCCCTGATTG-3′. PCR for genotyping was performed 
with primers A (5′-GCATCAGGAGGGTTTCATGT-3′) and B (5′-GTCTC￾GGCCTCATTGCTAAG-3′), which yielded 164-bp and 331-bp products for 
wild-type and floxed Klf5 alleles, respectively.
Quantification of Cre-mediated recombination. Competitive PCR was per￾formed to calculate the relative deletion frequency using primers A, B, and C 
(5′-TGACCCATTACCGAATCTACTG-3′), which produced 331-bp and 
250-bp bands for the floxed and floxed-out Klf5 alleles, respectively. The 
respective abundances of the floxed and floxed-out Klf5 alleles were ana￾lyzed using real-time PCR with the same primer sets. To calculate absolute 
numbers of alleles in a given cell sample, we used external standards con￾taining known numbers of DNA fragments derived from Klf5-floxed and 
floxed-out alleles.
TAC model. TAC was performed as described previously (50). Briefly, mice 
(8–10 weeks old, 21–24 g body weight) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal 
injection of a mixture of xylazine (5 mg/kg) and ketamine (100 mg/kg).

The animals were then placed in a supine position, an endotracheal tube 
was inserted, and the animals were ventilated using a volume-cycled rodent 
ventilator with a tidal volume of 0.4 ml room air and a respiratory rate 
of 110 breaths/minute. The chest cavity was exposed by cutting open the 
proximal portion of the sternum. After the aortic arch between the innomi￾nate and left common carotid arteries was isolated, it was constricted with 
a 7-0 nylon suture tied firmly 3 times against a 25- or 27-gauge blunted 
needle for LI- and HI-TAC, respectively. Sham-operated mice underwent 
the identical surgical procedure, including isolation of the aorta, but with￾out placement of the suture.
Administration of JB1, a peptide IGF-1 receptor antagonist. C57BL/6 mice 
(8–10 weeks old, 21–24 g body weight) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal 
injection of pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg). An incision was made in the 
midscapular region under sterile conditions, and an osmotic minipump 
(Alzet) containing either JB1 (BACHEM) dissolved in 0.15 mol/l NaCl and 
1 mmol/l acetic acid or vehicle only was implanted. The delivery rate was 
1 mg/kg/d for 14 days.
Echocardiography. Animals were lightly anesthetized with 2,2,2-tribro￾moethanol (200 mg/kg) and set in a supine position. Two dimensional 
(2D) guided M-mode echocardiography was performed using an echocar￾diogram (model 4500, Sonos) equipped with a 15 to 6 L MHz transducer 
(Philips). The heart at the level of the LV papillary muscle was imaged in 
the 2D mode in the parasternal short-axis view with a depth setting of 
2 cm. LV diastolic posterior wall thickness (PWT), LV diastolic dimensions 
(LVDd), and LV end-systolic dimensions (LVDs) were measured. LV frac￾tional shortening (%FS) was calculated as (LVDd – LVDs)/LVDd × 100.
Histological analysis. Heart sections were prepared as described previously 
(14) and stained with H&E for overall morphology. Immunohistochemical 
staining of KLF5 was performed using an anti-KLF5 monoclonal antibody 
(KM1784). A biotin-conjugated goat anti-rat antibody, streptavidin-con￾jugated horseradish peroxidase (Dako), and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) 
were used to visualize labeling. For double staining of KLF5 and αMHC, 
we also used anti-αMHC monoclonal antibody CMA19 (51). Simple Stain 
AP(M) (Nichirei) and an Alkaline Phosphatase Substrate Kit I (Vector) were 
used to visualize labeling. To quantify cardiac interstitial fibrosis, we stained 
sections with elastic picrosirius red, after which images were captured with a 
digital camera and analyzed using Photoshop (Adobe) and Scion Image.
β-Galactosidase staining. Heart tissues were fixed for 12 hours at 4°C in 
PBS containing 0.4% glutaraldehyde, 0.01% Na deoxycholate, 0.1% NP40, 
0.1 M MgCl2, and 5 mM EGTA; rinsed 3 times for 30 minutes in PBS; and

then incubated for 24 hours at 37°C in a staining solution [1 mM MgCl2, 
20 mM K3Fe(CN)6, 20 mM K4Fe(CN)6, 1 mg/ml X-gal in PBS]. LacZ-stained 
sections were counterstained with nuclear fast red for nuclei, biotin-conju￾gated isolectin B4 (Vector) for ECs, and elastic picrosirius red for fibrosis.
Cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area. Heart sections were deparaffinized, rehy￾drated, and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with FITC-labeled 
wheat germ agglutinin (Sigma-Aldrich) to visualize myocyte membranes. 
Regions that included the circular shapes of capillaries were selected from 
the epicardial side of the LV free walls. The mean cross-sectional area of 
cardiomyocytes was determined for each mouse from 60 to 80 cells.
RNA extraction and real-time PCR. Heart tissues were stored in RNAlater 
RNA stabilization reagent (QIAGEN) at 4°C. Total RNA was extracted 
using an RNeasy Fibrous Tissue Mini Kit (QIAGEN). First-strand cDNA 
synthesis was performed with 1 μg of total RNA, random hexamers, and 
SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR was 
performed using a QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (QIAGEN) in a Light￾Cycler (Roche). The expression level of each gene was normalized to that of 
18s rRNA, which served as an endogenous internal control. The sequences 
of the PCR primers are shown in Supplemental Table 2.
Isolation of neonatal and adult cardiomyocytes and non-myocytes. Neonatal 
ventricles from 1-day-old ICR mice were separated and minced in ice-cold 
balanced salt solution, as described previously with minor modifications 
(52). To isolate cardiac cells, the tissues were incubated in a balanced salt 
solution containing 0.2% collagenase type 2 (Worthington Biochemical) 
for 6 minutes at 37°C with agitation. The digestion buffer was replaced 
7 times, at which point the tissues were completely digested. The dispersed 
cells were incubated in 10-cm culture dishes for 80 minutes to remove 
non-myocytes. The unattached viable cells, which were rich in cardiomyo￾cytes, were cultured on gelatin-coated dishes at 37°C in DMEM supple￾mented with 10% FBS and 10 μM cytosine 1-β-d-arabinofuranoside (Ara C) 
to inhibit fibroblast proliferation. Using this protocol, we consistently 
obtained cell populations containing at least 90%–95% cardiomyocytes. 
Non-myocyte cells that attached to the dishes were cultured in DMEM 
supplemented with 10% FBS and allowed to grow to confluence, then they 
were trypsinized and passaged at1:3. This procedure yielded cell cultures 
that were almost exclusively fibroblasts by the first passage. Experiments 
were carried out after 2 or 3 passages.
Adult cardiomyocytes were isolated using the Langendorff perfusion 
method as previously described (27). For isolation of non-myocyte￾enriched cells, hearts were dissected free of vessels and atria, washed in ice￾cold modified Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate (KHB) buffer (pH 7.2) (Sigma￾Aldrich), and quickly cut into pieces. The heart pieces were incubated in 
5 ml of digesting solution (0.25 mg/ml Liberase TH [Roche] and 10 mM 
HEPES in balanced salt solution containing calcium and magnesium) 
for 8 minutes at 37°C with vigorous stirring. The supernatant was then 
added to 10 ml of ice-cold KHB. Five milliliters of fresh digesting solution 
was added to the remaining tissue fragments, and the digestion and sam￾pling steps were repeated until all the tissue was dissolved. The collected 
cells were filtered through 35-μm nylon mesh (BD Falcon) and then used 
for flow cytometry. Levels of Myh6 mRNA expression were much lower 
in the isolated cell populations than in normal whole hearts, indicating 
that the cell populations obtained using the method described here were 
enriched in non-myocytes (Supplemental Figure 15). Flow cytometric 
analysis (Figure 3) showed that the cell populations contained large frac￾tions of fibroblasts and ECs.
Flow cytometric analysis and sorting. Single cells were isolated from adult 
hearts and incubated with PE-conjugated anti-Thy1 antibody (eBioscience), 
FITC-conjugated anti-CD31 antibody (BD Biosciences), and allophycocya￾nin-conjugated CD3e antibody (eBioscience), after which they were analyzed 
and sorted using a FACSAria II (BD Biosciences) and FlowJo software.
For analysis of β-galactosidase expression and the sorting of LacZ+
cells, a FluoReporter LacZ Flow Cytometry Kit (Molecular Probes, 
Invitrogen) was used according to the manufacturer’s recommenda￾tions. Cells were stained with the fluorogenic β-galactosidase substrate 
fluorescein di-β-d-galactopyranoside (FDG).
Production of medium conditioned by cardiac fibroblasts. Cardiac fibroblasts were 
grown to subconfluency in 10-cm dishes. The medium was then replaced 
with fresh serum-free DMEM, and the cells were incubated for additional 
48 hours. The medium was then collected as conditioned medium.
siRNA. siRNA for Klf5 and control siRNA were purchased from Dhar￾macon. Using Lipofectamine RNAiMax (Invitrogen), the siRNA at a final 
concentration of 20 nM in 10 ml of culture medium was transfected into 
mouse cardiac fibroblasts plated in 10-cm culture dishes. siRNA-mediated 
knockdown of Klf5 did not affect mRNA expression levels in KLF family 
members that reportedly function in the cardiovascular system (e.g., Klf2, 
Klf4, Klf10, Klf13, and Klf15) (Supplemental Figure 16).
Morphometric studies of cells. Neonatal cardiomyocytes cultured in 3.5-cm 
dishes were maintained in serum-free DMEM for 24 hours, after which the 
culture medium was replaced with either fresh serum-free DMEM or medi￾um conditioned by cardiac fibroblasts. To analyze the effects of neutralizing 
IGF-1, either anti–IGF-1 neutralizing antibody (Millipore) or control IgG 
(Sigma-Aldrich) was then added, and the cells were cultured for an addition￾al 24 hours. To analyze the effects of growth factors, cells were first cultured 
for 24 hours in serum-free DMEM. The medium was then replaced with 
serum-free DMEM containing vehicle, IGF-1 (Wako), or PDGF-A (R&D Sys￾tems), and the cells were cultured for an additional 24 hours. The cells were 
then fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized for 10 minutes with 
0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS, after which they were incubated 
in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 10 minutes to block non￾specific staining. They were then incubated with anti–sarcomeric α-actinin 
antibody (Sigma-Aldrich), followed by treatment with an Alexa-conjugated 
secondary antibody. Cardiomyocyte size was determined by measuring the 
surface area of sarcomeric α-actinin–positive cells.
Enzyme-linked immunoassay. To analyze secretion of ANP, cardiomyocytes 
were cultured in the serum-free DMEM for 24 hours and then stimulated 
with fresh serum-DMEM or medium conditioned by cardiac fibroblasts for 
48 hours. The concentration of ANP protein in the culture medium was mea￾sured using an enzyme-linked immunoassay kit (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals).
Analysis of expression of alternatively spliced Igf1 mRNA. IGF-1 is controlled 
by 2 distinct promoters associated with untranslated exons 1 and 2, which 
generate two types of mRNA, containing either exon 1 (class 1 mRNA) or 
exon 2 (class 2 mRNA) plus a common block of translated exons (53–55). 
Expression of the two transcripts is differentially regulated in different tis￾sues and species and during development. We therefore determined which 
mRNA was the major transcript in mouse heart. The respective abundances 
of the two transcripts were analyzed using real-time PCR with primer sets 
that specifically amplified either the class 1 or class 2 mRNA. To calcu￾late absolute numbers of transcripts in a given amount of total RNA, we 
used external standards containing known numbers of class 1 or 2 cDNA 
fragments. We found that class 2 transcripts were much more abundant 
in both cardiac fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes than class 1 transcripts, 
and also in hearts after LI-TAC (Supplemental Figure 17). We therefore 
analyzed expression of class 2 mRNA as the major Igf1 transcript in the 
heart and cardiac fibroblasts (Figure 6, A–C). Igf1 class 1 and class 2 cDNA 
fragments were amplified using a forward primer specific for each leader 
exon (exon 1, 5′-ATGGGGAAAATCAGCAGTC-3′; exon 2, 5′-CTGCCTGT￾GTAAACGACCCGG-3′) and a reverse primer (exon 3-4 junction, 5′-GGCT￾GCTTTTGTAGGCTTCAGTGG-3′) (56).
Igf1 promoter–luciferase constructs. Because the class 2 Igf1 mRNA is much 
more abundantly expressed than class 1 mRNA in the heart, we analyzed

the promoter associated with exon 2 (33). A genomic fragment of the 
5′-flanking region and a part of exon 2 (–80 to +43 bp) was obtained by PCR 
using mouse genomic DNA. The promoter fragment was then subcloned 
into a pGL3 basic luciferase reporter vector (Promega) to generate pGL3-
Igf1. A mutation within the potential KLF-binding motif was introduced 
by PCR to generate pGL3-igf1mutKLF. NIH-3T3 cells grown to 60%–80% 
confluence were then transfected with the vectors, after which luciferase 
activities were measured and normalized to β-galactosidase activity. The 
Klf5 expression vector was described previously (57). The Klf15 expression 
vector was obtained by inserting the Klf15 cDNA into pCAGMS (14).
ChIP. ChIP assays were performed as previously described (29, 58). 
Mouse cardiac fibroblasts were formalin fixed, and then chromatin sam￾ples were immunoprecipitated using anti-KLF5 mouse monoclonal anti￾body (KM3918) or control IgG antibody. PCR was performed with the 
following region-specific primers: for the mouse Igf1 KLF5 site within the 
exon 2–associated promoter, 5′-ACCCAGGCTCAGAGCATACC-3′ and 
5′-GGGTCGTTTACACAGCAGGT-3′; for intron 2 (an intronic region +750 
bp from the translation initiation site that does not contain KLF-binding 
motifs; negative control), 5′-CCTTCACCGCTCTCTGAAAC-3′ and 5′-
CATCAGGGCTTCATGGTTCT-3′; and for the Pdgfa KLF5 site, 5′-ATG￾TAGCTGCCTGCGTGAG-3′ and 5′-CGACAGGGAGGGGGTTATAG-3′.
Statistics. Data are shown as mean ± SEM. Paired data were evaluated 
using Student’s t test. Comparisons between multiple groups were made 
using 1-way ANOVA followed by a post-hoc Bonferroni test. Survival rates 
among mice were analyzed using long-rank test. P values less than 0.05 
were considered statistically significant.
