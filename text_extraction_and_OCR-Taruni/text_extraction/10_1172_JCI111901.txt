Abstract
A polyuric syndrome with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI)
is a frequent consequence of prolonged administration of lithium
(Li) salts. Studies in the past, mainly the acute and in vitro
experiments, indicated that Li ions can inhibit hydroosmotic
effect of 18-arginineivasopressin (AVP) at the step of cAMP
generation in vitro. However, the pathogenesis of the NDI due
to chronic oral administration of low therapeutic doses of Li
salts is not yet clarified. We conducted a comprehensive study
to clarify the mechanism by which Li administered orally for
several weeks induces polyuria and NDI in rats. Albino rats
consuming a diet which contained Li (60 mmol/kg) for 4 wk
developed marked polyuria and polydipsia; at the end of 4 wk
the plasma Li was 0.7±0.09 mM (mean±SEM; n = 36). Li￾treated rats had a significantly decreased (-33%) tissue os￾molality in papilla and greatly reduced cortico-papillary gradient
of urea (cortex-43%; medulla-64%; papilla-74%). Plasma
urea was significantly (P < 0.001) lower in Li-treated rats
(5.4±0.2 mM) compared with controls (6.8±03 mM). Med￾ullary collecting tubules (MCT) and papillary collecting ducts
(PCD) microdissected from Li-treated animals had higher
content of protein than MCT and PCD from the control rats.
The cAMP accumulation in response to AVP added in vitro
was significantly (A = -60%) reduced. Also, the cAMP accu￾mulation in MCIr and PCD after incubation with forskolin was
markedly lower in Li-treated rats. Addition of 0.5 mM
1-methyl,3-isobutyl-xanthine did not restore the cAMP accu￾mulation in response to AVP and forskolin in MCT from Li￾treated animals. In collecting tubule segments from polyuric
rats with hypothalamic diabetes insipidus (Brattleboro homo￾zygotes) the AVP-dependent cAMP accumulation was not
diminished. The activity of adenylate cyclase (AdC) in MCT
of Li-treated rats, both the basal and the activity stimulated
by AVP, forskolin, or fluoride, was significantly (A --30%)
reduced, while the activity of cAMP phosphodiesterase (cAMP￾This paper was presented at the 16th Annual Meeting of the American

PDIE) in the same segment showed no significant difference
from the controls. Also, the content of ATP in MCT microdis￾sected from Li-treated rats and incubated in vitro did not differ
from controls. The rate of ['4Cjsuccinate oxidation to '4CO2 in
MAL was inhibited (-77%) by 1 mM furosemide, which
indicates that this metabolic process is coupled with NaCl
cotransport in MAL. The rate of "4CO2 production from
I'4Cisuccinate in MAL was not significantly different between
control and Li-treated rats. In MCT of control rats, the rate
of I'4Cisuccinate oxidation was -3 times lower than in MAL.
The rate of '4CO2 production from I'4Cjsuccinate in MCT of
Li-treated rats was significantly (A +33%) higher than in
MCT dissected from control rats. Based on these results, we
conclude that at least two factors play an important role in the
pathogenesis of NDI consequent to chronic oral administration
of Li: (a) decreased ability of MCI' and PCD to generate and
accumulate cAMP in response to stimulation by AVPl, this
defect is primarily due to diminished activity of AdC in these
tubular segments caused by prolonged exposure to Li; and (b)
lower osmolality of renal papillary tissue, due primarily to
depletion of urea, which decreases osmotic driving force for
water reabsorption in collecting tubules. On the other hand,
NaCl reabsorption in MAL is apparently not affected by
chronic Li treatment.
Introduction
The polyuric syndrome that develops as a consequence of
chronic administration of lithium (Li) salts is the most frequent
and often troubling complication in the treatment of manic￾depressive disease with this antidepressant drug (1-6). The
major component of this polyuric syndrome is a [8-argi￾nine]vasopressin (AVP)-'resistant urinary concentrating de￾fect-the nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) (2, 5, 6). In
spite of numerous clinical and experimental studies in the past
several decades, the cellular mechanisms in the pathogenesis
of NDI caused by chronic Li treatment remain to be clarified.
Most of the past studies aimed to investigate pathogenesis
of Li-induced NDI, conducted on mammalian kidney and
amphibian epithelia (1-6), examined the effects of the acute
Li addition in vitro, or acute Li infusion in vivo on the AVP

dependent, cyclic 3',5'-AMP (cAMP)-mediated transport pro￾cesses (7-13). Such studies suggested that Li ion inhibits the
increase of water permeability of AVP mainly, albeit not
exclusively (7, 8, 14), at the step of the AVP-dependent
generation of cAMP (2-6, 9-12). Most renal studies of the
AVP-dependent cAMP system have been conducted mainly
on kidney tissue preparations (9-12) that contain at least two
types of tubular segments that are both endowed with AVP￾dependent cAMP metabolism (3, 15), specifically medullary
collecting tubules (MCT) and the medullary thick ascending
limb of Henle's loop (MAL).
Moreover, the effects of Li on renal components of urinary
concentrating mechanism were examined, usually, only after
short periods (I wk) of treatment and/or with Li salt admin￾istered parenterally (2, 8, 16, 17). While results of the past
studies suggested in principle the mode of Li action, these
experimental models are quite remote from the conditions
under which the NDI develops after chronic oral consumption
of relatively small amounts of Li, as it is employed in man￾agement of manic-depressive psychosis (1, 2, 5, 10, 12).
In view of these considerations, we analyzed the animal
model of Li-induced polyuria, which closely duplicates renal
effects of chronic Li administration encountered in humans
(17-21). In this model, the Li is administered to rats orally
for at least several weeks in solid food, simultaneously with ad
lib. intake of 0.9% NaCl (18-20). This regimen prevents
intermittent sharp increases in plasma Li above the therapeutic
range (17, 22) and prevents sodium depletion that leads to
acute Li nephrotoxicity (19, 20, 22).
Our present results show that chronic oral administration
of Li impairs the AVP-dependent cAMP metabolism in col￾lecting tubule system at the step of AVP-sensitive adenylate
cyclase (AdC), and reduces cortico-papillary gradient of solutes
in renal tissue, which is due to severe depletion of urea.
Methods
Experiments were conducted on adult male albino rats of either
Sprague-Dawley or Wistar strains, both purchased from Charles River
Breeding Laboratories, Wilmington, MA. Results of the studies on
these two strains of rats were virtually identical and data are presented
interchangeably. The rats were kept in an air-conditioned room (21 -
25°C) with a free access to (free choice to drink) both distilled water
and solution of 0.9% NaCI (18-21). Likewise, they had ad lib. access
to standard rat diet (Purina Laboratory Rat Chow, Ralston Purina
Co., St. Louis, MO) with or without admixed LiCI. Rats of Long￾Evans strain and adult male homozygotes of Brattleboro strain with
hereditary hypothalamic diabetes insipidus (HHDI) were purchased
from Blue Spruce Farms, Altamont, NY.
Experimental design. As a general rule, rats treated with Li (referred
to from here on as Li-rats) and the corresponding controls were always
handled and analyzed using paired design (23-25). The control and
Li-treated animals entered and completed the treatment regimen pari
passu, were killed on the same day, and the blood, urine, and tissues
were collected and analyzed simultaneously (23-25). Likewise, specific
tubule segments were microdissected from the kidneys of the control
and Li-rats on the same day using the same solutions, hormones,
drugs, and other chemicals (23-25).
Typically, 4-6 rats, weighing 200-230 g, were entered into the
protocol as a control group (2-3 rats), which received standard chow
diet, and as an experimental group (2-3 rats), which received the same
chow but with added Li to the final content of 60 mmol LiCl/kg (19-
21). The Li-containing diet was prepared by adding 1 M LiCl and an
approximate amount of water to powdered standard rat chow to give
wet mash, which was subsequently dried in the oven at 60'C.
Intake of fluids, distilled water, and 0.9% NaCl solution was
recorded 4 d within I wk and the body weight once a week. After 24
d, the rats were placed in individual metabolic cages and the urine
was collected between 9 a.m. and 12 a.m. (20). After a total period of
26-29 d of the above-mentioned dietary regimen, the rats (control and
experimental) were anesthetized with intraperitoneal sodium pentobar￾bital, and under anesthesia a sample of blood was taken from the
jugular vein. The abdomen was opened under anesthesia and a sample
of urine was collected from the urinary bladder by syringe. The right
kidney was ligated and removed for analysis of tissue solutes. The left
kidney was prepared for perfusion and microdissection of tubules, as
described below.
Analysis of solutes in tissue and fluids (23). The kidneys were
rapidly removed under anesthesia. The cortex, outer (red) medulla,
and papilla were separated by razor blade and rapidly frozen by
clamping with stainless steel tongs precooled by immersion in liquid
N2. Deep-frozen tissue was transferred to polyethylene (12 X 75 mm)
test tubes filled with liquid N2 and surrounded by dry ice. The tubes
with tissues in the dry-frozen state were weighed with a Sartorius
microbalance to determine the wet weight. After overnight Iyophiliza￾tion, tubes were then weighed again for the determination of dry
weight (23).
Lyophilized dry tissue was extracted for determination of solutes
using, in principle, the method of Appleboom (26), as in our previous
study (23). Water content in samples was expressed as percentage of
wet weight. Total tissue osmolality was calculated as follows (23): total
osmolality [mosM/kg H20] = [urea] + 2[Na'] + 2[K+]. Na' and K+
were determined by atomic adsorption photometer (Instrument Lab￾oratory 951, Elk Grove Village, IL) and urea by the colorimetric
method using Harleco kits (23). Plasma Li was determined by flame
emission spectrophotometry, after precipitation of proteins with 5%
trichloroacetic acid. Urine osmolality (U.) was measured with a Fiske
osmometer (Fiske Assoc., Burlington, MA). Creatinine (Cr) was deter￾mined calorimetrically (27).
Microdissection and analysis of tubules. Tubular segments were
dissected from control and Li-treated rats, always on the same day,
using the procedure described in our previous studies (23-25, 28-30).
Briefly, under light anesthesia with pentobarbital (6 mg/100 g body
weight [b wt]), the aorta was cannulated retrogradely with polyethylene
PE-I00 tubing (Clay Adams Div. of Becton, Dickinson & Co., Parsip￾pany, NJ), and the tip was placed just distal to the branching of the
left renal artery. Composition of all solutions is described at the end
of the Methods section. The kidney was perfused to complete blanching
with 5-10 ml of perfusion solution, and subsequently followed by 20
ml of heparinized (heparin concentration 20 U. S. Pharmacopeia
U/ml) collagenase medium for -5 min. After the perfusion, the
kidney was quickly removed and sliced with a razor blade (23-25).
The slices were then incubated in aerated collagenase medium at 350C
for 35-45 min. For dissection of papillary collecting ducts (PCD), the
tissue strips were incubated in a collagenase medium for 60 min at
350C (25, 29). The slices were then thoroughly rinsed in ice-cold
microdissection medium and transferred to Petri dishes for microdis￾section (23-25). Microdissection and all subsequent procedures were
performed at 00-40C. Segments of MAL and MCT were carefully
teased out from the inner stripe of the outer medulla, PCD from inner
medulla (papilla), or cortical collecting tubules (CCT) from cortex,
with sharpened steel needles using a stereomicroscope (magnification
of 30). Segments were identified using the established criteria, as in
our previous studies (23-25, 28-30). Disected segments were transferred
onto small discs (circa 3 mm2) of glass coverslip. The total length of
tubules in the sample was then determined. Samples were placed on
the stage of microscope with a drawing attachment (camera lucida)
and inspected under 100 magnification (23, 25). Tubules in the sample
and in the 1-mm calibration grid were quickly drawn on white paper
with a marker. Total tubular length was measured using a Dietzger
planimeter from drawn pictures of samples. The measured samples
were kept at 00-40C before incubations, when the assay was performed
immediately, or before quick freezing for storage at -80'C.

Determination oftubule diameter. Since chronic treatment with Li
can produce morphologically detectable enlargement of collecting
tubules (19, 21), we determined the outer diameter of dissected tubules
from photographs. Samples containing several freshly microdissected
tubules were photographed under microscope at low magnification
and the negatives were projected on a screen with an overhead
projector. The diameter was measured in millimeters with a ruler and
calculated into micrometers by measuring a 1-mm grid on photographs
taken at the same magnification. The outer diameters of examined
segments of MCT from Li-treated rats (53.0±2.2 Mm, mean±SEM
from eight rats; total number of samples n = 224) was significantly (P
< 0.001, t test; +22%, P < 0.005, paired t test) wider than the diameter
of MCT microdissected from corresponding controls (43.4±1.4 Mm,
mean±SEM from eight rats; total number of samples n = 189).
Enzyme assays. Assays for AdC and cAMP-phosphodiesterase
(cAMP-PDIE) were performed on permeabilized (disrupted) tubular
segments (23-25, 28-30). The microdissection medium was replaced
with 0.25 Ml of hypoosmotic medium; samples were then frozen rapidly
on dry ice and stored at -80'C overnight. Samples were allowed to
thaw at 4VC before being assayed for enzyme activities.
The AdC activity was measured according to the method described
in detail previously (23-25, 28-30). Tubular samples (1-3 mm) were
incubated for 30 min at 30'C in 2.5 Ml consisting of 0.25 mM [a￾32PJATP (4 X 106 cpm/sample), 1 mM cAMP, 3.8 mM MgCI2, 0.25
mM EDTA, 100 mM Tris HCI, 20 mM Cr phosphate, and 1 mg/ml
Cr kinase (pH 7.4), with NaCI and urea added in a 1:2 M ratio to
adjust final osmolality to 600 mosM (23, 29). After stopping the
reaction (23-25, 30), the cAMP was isolated according to the method
of Salomon et al. (31); the AdC activity was expressed as picomoles
cAMP per 30 min/Mg of protein.
The activity ofcAMP-PDIE. Tubular segments (0.5-1.5 mm length)
were incubated for 10 min at 370C in 2.5 Ml consisting of 10-6 M
[3HJcAMP, 10 mM MgSO4, 0.1 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris-HCI (pH
8.0) (23-25, 29, 32), with added NaCI and urea in a 1:2 M ratio to
adjust the osmolality of medium to 600 mosM. The reaction was
stopped by freezing on dry ice and further analyzed as described
in our previous studies (23-25, 32). Activity of cAMP-PDIE was
expressed in femtomoles cAMP hydrolyzed per minute per microgram
of protein (32).
Accumulation of cAMP in MCT, PCD, and CCT was measured
on freshly microdissected tubules, as described in detail previously
(23-25, 29-30). For these incubations, -3.5-8.5 mm of tubule length
for basal cAMP accumulation and 0.5-5 mm for AVP-stimulated or
forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation were required. After mea￾surement of tubule length, microdissection medium was aspirated off
and replaced with 2.5 Ml of modified Krebs-ringer buffer (KRB) (for
composition, see below) with or without test agents and hormone.
After 10 min incubation at 30°C, the reaction was stopped by placing
the slides on dry ice. Samples were transferred into test tubes with 100
Ml of 50 mM Na acetate and placed for 3 min in a boiling water bath
(23-25, 30). The cAMP content was determined by radioimmunoassay
as described in every detail previously (23-25, 28-30). The content of
cAMP in the sample (tubules and incubation medium together) is
expressed in femtomoles per micrograms of tubular protein (24, 28,
30), unless specified otherwise.
Determination ofA TP. The ATP content in dissected intact tubules
was measured with a micro-bioluminescence assay using luciferin￾luciferase system, which is described in detail elsewhere (33). Briefly,
freshly microdissected tubules (1-2 mm) were first incubated for 20
min at 30°C in 2.5 Ml of KRB to stabilize tubules metabolically and
to normalize assay conditions for all samples (33). Samples were then
frozen on dry ice, transferred to glass test tubes containing 15 Ml of
0.02 M Tris/MgSO4 buffer (Picocheck buffer, Packard 6016820, Packard
Instrument Co., Downers Grove, IL) pH 7.75. An equal volume of an
ATP-extracting reagent for somatic cells (Picoex S; Packard 6016740,
Packard Instrument Co.) was added and mixed. Then 40 M1 of enzyme
reagent (Picozyme F; Packard 6016710, Packard Instrument Co.) were
added into a 6 X 50-mm glass tube and the background light (enzyme
blank) was counted three times for 12 s for each sample (33). ATP
standards or tubular extracts (10 1l) were rapidly injected directly into
the tube containing enzyme, and light production was measured on
Picolite model 6100 luminometer (Packard Instrument Co.). An average
of three values was used for calculations. Enzyme blanks were subtracted
and the standards and unknown extracts were treated in the same way
(33). Results are expressed as femtomoles ATP per microgram of
tubular protein.
NaCl transport-coupled "CO2 production from 1,4-["#C]succinate
in isolated tubules. "CO2 production from 1,4-["C]succinate was
measured, in principle, according to the method of Le Bouffant et al.
(34) modified for MAL in our previous study (23), with several further
modifications. We used ['4C]succinate rather than ['4C]lactate (23), in
view of the recent observations that activity of succinate dehydrogenase
(SDH) determined histochemically was altered in some tubular segments
of Li-rats (21). Moreover, we observed in preliminary studies that the
rate of '4CO2 production was greater with use of ['4C]succinate than
with ["4C]lactate (23). The principle of the method consists in the
continuous trapping, by simple diffusion into KOH, of the metabolic
product "CO2 resulting from oxidative metabolism of 'C-radiolabeled
metabolic substrate by isolated tubules incubated in a bicarbonate-free
solution (23, 34). Freshly dissected MAL or MCT from both control
and Li-treated rats were transferred onto a round coverslip placed on
the concave bacteriological slide (23) and the length of tubule segments
was measured. At the beginning of the assay, the microdissection
medium was replaced with 1.0-1.5 gl of metabolic medium, which
contained 1,4-['4C]succinate (total composition given below) with or
without added drugs. A 2-Ml droplet of 0.3 M KOH was placed on a
filter disc that was situated on another coverslip in the same concave
of bacteriological slide (23). Then the sealed chamber (23) was incubated
at 350C for 80 min. Preliminary experiments showed that, as with use
of ['4C]lactate (23), the rate of 'CO2 production from 1,4-[4C]succinate
was linear with time for this period in both MAL and MCT. Likewise,
"CO2 production from 1,4-['4C]succinate was proportional to length
of tubules in the sample up to 3 mm. The reaction was stopped by
placing the slides with samples on dry ice, and 'C-radioactivity on
coverslips with 0.3 M KOH was measured by liquid scintillation
counting (23). The rate of "4CO2 production is expressed as picomoles
of '4CO2 generated from 1,4-["4Csuccinate per 80 min/Mg of tubule
protein.
In our previous study we confirmed, using several criteria, that
metabolism of ['4C]lactate in our system is coupled to continuing
NaCl cotransport in MAL (23). Inclusion of loop diuretic furosemide
or replacement of NaCl in the metabolic medium with equimolar LiCI
resulted in marked suppression of ['4C]lactate oxidation (23). Likewise,
in the present study, the "4CO2 formation from 1,4-['4C]succinate in
MAL (1,084±216 fmol '4CO2/4g protein/80 min; mean±SEM, n = 4
experiments) was strongly inhibited (A -77+4%, mean±SEM; P
< 0.001, paired t test) by addition of 10-3 M furosemide (236±52 fmol
'4CO2/Mg protein/80 min; mean±SEM, n = 4 experiments). Also,
replacement of NaCI in metabolic medium by NaI caused marked
decrease (-5 1%) of '4CO2 production from 1,4['4C]succinate.
Determination ofprotein content in tubules. To examine whether
the protein content per millimeter of tubular length in MCT, MAL,
or PCD is affected by chronic Li administration, the samples of
microdissected segments, total length (-5-10 mm) solubilized in 25
zd of 1% sodium dodecyl sulphate and then assayed with use of
Lowry's method (35) as adapted by us (24, 28, 33) for measurements
of microdissected tubule samples (Table I).
Expression and evaluation of results. The biochemical parameters
of microdissected nephron segments are expressed per millimeter of
tubular length, or per total protein content, calculated from the typical
protein content per length unit (millimeter) of the given segment (24,
30), and per the actual length of the tubules measured in each
individual sample (24, 28). Since in the distal nephron segments of
rats chronically treated with lithium (Li-rats) the protein content was
was markedly higher (Table I) than in corresponding segments from
controls, the metabolic parameters in tubules from Li-rats and controls

determined as described above (Table I).
As outlined above, experimental rats, i.e., Li-rats (or HHDI Brat￾tleboro homozygote rats), and corresponding control rats entered and
finished the experimental protocol simultaneously, and also all analyses
were performed on paired basis (23-25). Statistical evaluation was
made with use of the t test, as specified in Results. Values P > 0.05
were considered nonsignificant (NS).
Solutions and materials. The microdissection medium was a mod￾ified Hank's solution as used in our previous studies (23-25, 28-30)
(in final concentration): 127 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgSO4, 0.33 mM
Na2HPO4, 1.0 mM MgCl2, 20 mM Tris-HCl, and 0.25 mM CaC12,
pH 7.4. The composition of the collagenase medium was identical to
that of the microdissection medium, except that the CaC12 concentration
was 1 mM and it included collagenase (0.1% wt/vol), bovine serum
albumin (0.1% wt/vol), and hyaluronidase (0.1% wt/vol). The hypoos￾motic medium contained 1 mM MgC12, 0.25 mM EDTA, 0.1% bovine
serum albumin, and 1 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). Modified Krebs-ringer
buffer contained 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 0.8
mM CaC12, 10 mM sodium acetate, 10 mM glucose, 20 mM Tris,
and 2.0 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.4. Metabolic medium for '4C02 production
contained 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 1.8 mM
CaC12, 10 mM Na acetate, 5 mM glucose, 20 mM Tris, 2.0 mM
NaH2PO4, and 5 mM of 1,4-'4C-labeled-succinate (3 X 105 cpm/
sample), and pH was 7.4. Metabolic medium, KRB, and enzyme assay
solutions were adjusted to final osmolality of 600 mosM by addition
of NaCI and urea in molar ratio 1:2 (23, 29). In experiments with use
of forskolin (38), the stock solution of forskolin was made in ethyl
alcohol (EtOH). We established that 0.1% EtOH does not interfere
with assays and analyses; nevertheless, in all experiments with use of
forskolin, 0.1% EtOH was included to all samples (38).
Bovine serum albumin, rattlesnake venom (Crotalus atrox, colla￾genase type 1, 150 U/mg), hyaluronidase (type 1-5, 500 NF U/mg),
cAMP, and furosemide, as well as other biochemicals were purchased
from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO. Sodium heparin (Panheparin
1,000 U. S. Pharmacopeia U/ml) was purchased from Abbot Labora￾tories, Chemical Div., North Chicago, IL; [a-32P]ATP (37.6 Ci/mmol)
was purchased from ICN Nutritional Biochemicals, Cleveland, OH;
[3H]cAMP (32 Ci/mmol) and 1,4-['4Clsuccinate (53 Ci/mmol) were
also from ICN Nutritional Biochemicals. Synthetic AVP (385 U/mg),
I-methyl,3-isobutyl-xanthine (MIX), and forskolin were purchased
from Calbiochem-Behring Corp., American Hoechst Corp., San Diego,
CA. Radioimmunoassay kits for the measurement of cAMP content
were purchased from Schwarz/Mann Div., Becton-Dickinson & Co.,
Orangeburg, NY. These and all other compounds and reagents were
of the highest quality grade available and were purchased from standard
suppliers.
Results
Fluid and solute balance. The rats consuming chronically food
containing Li developed polydipsia and polyuria, which reached
plateau on the second week of the experiment. In parallel with
increased water intake, the Li-rats also increased consumption
of 0.9% NaCl solution offered to both groups of animals ad
lib. On the third week of the experiment, the Li-treated rats
consumed -9 times more NaCl in 0.9% solution than the
corresponding control rats. Therefore, about one-half of incre￾ment in fluid intake (Table II) was due to increase drinking of
distilled water (increase A +42.5 ml/100 g b wt/24 h) while
another half was due to increased drinking of isotonic saline

(A +46.5 ml/l00 g b wt/24 h). Li-rats showed steady but
slower growth, so that at the end of the study their body
weight was -20% lower compared with the controls (Table
III). The increased water intake (Table II) (A +524%) in Li￾rats was accompanied by a corresponding extent of increase
in the urine flow (A +440%). The Li-rats had markedly (-3
times) lower U.m; urine was hypotonic to plasma (Table II)
and showed an increase in the total solute excretion (Uosm
X V) of rather small extent (A +40%); the total urea output
(Uux, X V) was slightly higher, but the difference did not reach
statistical significance (Table II).
The urinary concentrating ability was briefly tested by
subjecting several control rats and Li-rats to a dehydration test
until 8% loss of the body weight (20). Under these conditions,
on the third week of the experiment, the maximum UOsm
achieved in Li rats (U.m = 679±91 mosM; mean±SEM, n
= 3) was similar as when tested after 4 wk of the Li treatment
(Uosm = 751±123 mosM; mean±SEM, n = 3), which was a
value far lower than achieved in the corresponding control
rats (Ucem = 2,177±225 mosM; mean±SEM, n = 3). At the
end of the experiments, control and Li-rats showed a similar
difference in U.m in the samples collected from the urinary
bladder (Table III) as in previous measurements (Table II).
These data show that after the third week of treatment with
Li, the experimental rats were already in established steady
state, as indicated by several parameters of fluid and solute
metabolism (Tables II and III).
The plasma Li levels (PLW) achieved in this experimental
model were well below 1 mM (Table III). As indicated in
previous reports (19, 20), chronically Li-treated rats show no
impairment in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). This is in
agreement with findings in the present study, where plasma
creatinine (Pr) at the end of the experiment in the Li-rats (Par
= 0.62±0.03 mg/dl; mean±SEM, n = 6) was identical to values

in the control animals (Par = 0.63±0.04 mg/dl; mean±SEM, n
= 5). On the other hand, the Li-rats showed a consistent
significant decrease (A -21%) in the plasma urea (Puma) levels
(Table III). The renal clearance of urea was assessed only
approximately; it was calculated from values of urinary excre￾tion (Uur X V; Table II) and Puma values (Table III) of the
same animal, and expressed in milliliters per 100 g b wt/60
min. Expressed in this way, the clearance of urea in Li-rats
(29.2±1.9; mean±SEM, n = 31) was significantly (P < 0.02, t
test) higher than in controls (21.9±1.9; mean±SEM, n = 27).
Tissue solutes. The content of water and major solutes was
analyzed in the three major zones of kidney tissue, i.e., in
cortex, medulla, and papilla, at the end of the experimental
period (Table IV). Control rats and Li-rats did not differ in
the net weight of kidney (Table III) or in the content of water
and K+ in the three zones of kidney, with the single exception
that the content of K+ was detectably higher (A + 14%) in the
medulla of Li-rats. The control rats and Li-rats did not differ
in cortical and medullary content of Na+; it was only in the
papilla of Li-rats that the Na+ content was slightly lower (A
-15%) than in controls. On the other hand, Li-rats differed
from controls in urea content of all the three analyzed zones
of the kidney. The most profound decline in urea content (A
-74%) was observed in the papilla of Li-rats (Table IV). Also,
the steepness of the cortico-papillary gradient of urea, expressed
as percentage (A%) difference of solute content in the medulla
or papilla from the solute content in cortex of the same
kidney, taken as 100%, was markedly diminished (Table IV).
The above-mentioned differences in individual solutes were
reflected also in a well-pronounced decrease (A -33%) in total
tissue solutes in papilla of Li-rats (Table IV).
The basal accumulation of cAMP in the intact tubules did
not differ between MCT from control and MCT from Li-rats
(Table V). On the other hand, when incubated in the presence
of AVP alone, the cAMP accumulation in MCT of Li-rats was
markedly diminished (Table V). The AVP-stimulated accu￾mulation of cAMP in MCT in Li-treated rats was lower at
both the maximum and submaximum stimulatory doses of
AVP (Fig. 1). Forskolin (l0-4 M) stimulated the cAMP to a
greater degree than the maximum stimulatory dose (10-6 M)
of AVP (Table V). The forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumu￾lation in MCT, and cAMP accumulation in the presence of
AVP with forskolin, added together were also markedly lower
in MCT of Li-rats than in controls (Table V).
In our previous studies (28, 32), as well as in the preliminary
experiments (data not shown), we established that the addition
of 5 X l0-4 M MIX causes more than -90% inhibition of
cAMP-PDIE, both in the MCT from the control and from the
Li-rats. When incubated in the presence of 5 X l0-4 M MIX
(Table V), the extent of cAMP accumulation in MCT incubated
with AVP alone, or with AVP plus forskolin, was also signifi￾cantly lower in Li-rats than in controls (Table V). The relative
extent of differences between control and Li-rats with stimulants
of cAMP generation alone (A% decrease of 50-68%; Table V)
was more pronounced than in experiments conducted in the
presence of MIX (decrease <40%; Table V). Similar differences
in cAMP accumulation between the control and Li-rats were
also observed when PCD were incubated with AVP alone, or
to a lesser degree, with AVP plus MIX, and with forskolin
alone (Table VI). Since Li accumulates in the rat kidney along
the cortico-papillary gradient, reaching a concentration <7
mmol/kg H20 in the papilla (8, 36), we examined whether the

of PCD from Li-rats with added AVP, AVP plus MIX, or

difference was observed between activity of cAMP-PDIE in
MCT from the control and from Li-rats (Table VII B).
Likewise, the content of ATP in MCT, incubated in vitro
under the identical conditions, was not significantly different
between tubules from Li-rats and control rats (Table VII C).
The addition of 15 mM LiCl into the incubation mixture had
little inhibitory effect ('-10%) on AVP-stimulated AdC
activity either in MCT from the control rats or in MCT from
Li-rats (data not shown). The activities of AdC and of cAMP￾PDIE were concisely examined also in MAL from the control
and Li-rats. Both the basal and AVP-stimulated activities of
AdC were decreased in MAL of Li-rats, while the activity of
cAMP-PDIE did not differ from controls (Table VIII).
The rate of '4CO2 production from 1,4-['4C]succinate was
not significantly different between MAL from Li-rats and MAL
from controls (Fig. 2). The addition of 10' M furosemide
inhibited the '4CO2 production to a similar degree in MAL
from the control rats (-83%) and in MAL from Li-rats (-81%)
(data not shown). In control rats, measured under the same
incubation conditions, the rate of '4CO2 production from 1,4-
['4C]succinate by MCT was -4 times lower than in MAL
(Fig. 2). In MCT from Li-rats, the rate of 1,4-[14C]succinate
oxidation to "'CO2 was significantly (A +43±6%, mean±SEM;
P < 0.025, paired t test) higher than in MCT of the control
rats (Fig. 2).
Cyclic AMP accumulation in various segments of collecting
tubule system, MCT, PCD, and CCT microdissected from
chronically polyuric HHDI rats were compared with their
corresponding controls (Table IX). In contrast to Li-polyuric
rats, the AVP-stimulated cAMP accumulation was not dimin￾ished in collecting tubules of polyuric HHDI Brattleboro rats
(Table IX).
Discussion
A chronic administration of Li by oral route and with adequate
supply of NaCl provents intermittent increases in plasma Li,
the Li-induced Na depletion, and keeps plasma Li in a
concentration range similar to therapeutic levels in man (18-
22). This polyuric syndrome with NDI in rats has characteristics
functionally similar to an analogous renal syndrome caused
by therapy with Li salts in human subjects (1, 2, 5), including
chronicity and PLi less than or equal to 1 mM (1, 5). Since
the past studies investigated the pathogenic role of Li mainly
by studying the acute Li infusion in vivo, addition of Li in
vitro, or the effects of Li were examined usually only after a
short (circa I wk) and/or parenteral treatment with Li (2, 10,
39), analysis of the chronic model in rat (18-20) reflects more
closely the NDI syndrome in clinical treatment with Li salts.
Our present study points to several key abnormalities of
AVP-regulated water excretion in this model of iatrogenic
NDI. In contrast to results of our previous study (39), which
analyzed effects of subacute (1 wk) exposure to parenterally
administered Li, the MCT from chronically Li-rats had wider
diameter, and higher kidney weight, consistent with the results
of recent morphologic studies of the same model (19, 22).
Evidently, the AVP-dependent cAMP metabolism is severely
blunted in MCT and in PCD of Li-rats (Tables V-VIII, Fig.
1). Lower accumulation of cAMP also in the presence of the
nonhormonal stimulant forskolin (40) suggests that the observed
abnormality in cAMP metabolism is not limited to the AVP￾sensitive cAMP system of MCT. Analogous findings of blunted
cAMP metabolism in PCD indicates that this defect is not
confined to the medullary portion of collecting tubules (Table

VI). Analysis of major components of cAMP metabolism
(Table VII) indicates that the impairment of AdC activity is a
key factor that accounts for low capacity to generate and
accumulate cAMP in MCT from Li-rats. The limited supply
of substrate ATP or an excessive cAMP breakdown apparently
does not play a role. A finding of decreased AVP-dependent
cAMP accumulation in MCT or PCD with MIX present
(Tables V and VI) also argues against anomalously high cAMP
catabolism.

without stimulation by both hormonal and nonhormonal
agents suggests that chronic exposure to Li impairs the AdC
complex in MCT at the catalytic subunit and/or guanyl
nucleotide coupling protein (40, 41). The decrease in the
activity of catalytic subunit alone may explain the pattern of
changes in AdC activity observed in MCT from Li-rats (Table
VII). While forskolin acts primarily to stimulate the catalytic
subunit of AdC (40), the other components are apparently
required for its action (41). Therefore, more than one com￾ponent of the AdC complex might have been affected by
chronic exposure to Li. The observation that cAMP accumu￾MAL

§ Significantly different (P < 0.05; t test) from controls.
lation in MCT is blunted when stimulated both by submaximal
and maximal doses of AVP (Fig. 1) is also consistent with
impairment of AdC components distal to the V2 receptor; V2
receptor is typically associated with AdC in cells of collecting
tubules and ascending Henle's loop (15). While it cannot be
excluded that AVP binding on the V2 receptor is also impaired,
taken together, the present results suggest that observed chronic
Li effects are not due simply to decreased affinity of V2
receptors to AVP. Future detailed analysis of V2 receptor-AdC
complex ought to clarify the exact molecular mechanism of
impairment caused by chronic exposure to Li. The question
may arise whether decreased capacity of MCT and PCD to
generate cAMP in response to AVP detected in vitro can
account for the functional resistance of collecting tubules to
AVP in vivo (6, 13). Although conclusions should be guarded,
analogy from other models of NDI suggests that indeed the
deficient cAMP accumulation, as detected in vitro, corresponds
to functional refractoriness to AVP in vivo (3, 6, 13, 24, 25).
Our previous study suggested that with shorter exposure
to Li, the AVP-sensitive AdC is decreased only in MCT (39).
However, after a more chronic course of Li administration,
the impairment of AdC activity in MAL (Table VIII) was
analogous to that in MCT (Table VII), which indicated that
length of Li treatment and perhaps also the route of Li
administration (17, 22) can determine the pattern of impair￾ment. Lowering the AVP-sensitive AdC in both medullary
segments, MCT and MAL can explain that the decreased
AVP-sensitive AdC has been observed after chronic Li treatment
in the past studies even in a mixed membrane preparation
from the whole undivided medullary tissue (10, 11).
The observed defects in collecting tubules (Tables I, V￾VII) are most likely the result from the chronic exposure of
cells to Li, rather than due to the immediate presence of Li
ions in body fluids. At PU < 1 mM the tissue content of Li in
bladder urine (Table III) or in papilla (8, 36), even when
increased by AVP (37), did not exceed < 13 mM. In the
previous studies (7, 39), as well as in the present study, Li
added in vitro at concentrations _ 10 mM did not influence
the cAMP accumulation. Therefore, while the presence of Li
ions might contribute to decreased tubular response to AVP
in vivo, as suggested by microperfusion studies of Cogan and
Abramow (6, 13), this factor is expected to be a quantitatively
minor one.
Decreased AVP-dependent cAMP accumulation and AdC
activity seen in Li-rats is not likely the consequence of chronic
polyuria per se. First, the AVP-sensitive AdC activity in MCT
from HHDI Brattleboro rats with chronic polyuria does not
differ from the controls (42). Second, results of our own
control experiments on polyuric HHDI Brattleboro rats, not
treated by Li, strongly indicate that polyuric state per se does
not lead to blunting of AVP-dependent cAMP accumulation
MCT, PCD, or CCT (Table IX), as does the polyuria in Li
rats (Tables V and VI). Moreover, the previous studies exam￾ining the renal concentrating ability have shown that while Li￾polyuric rats failed to concentrate urine after standard dehy￾dration (until 7% drop in b wt), the control rats with polyuria
induced by drinking of glucose water showed a normal con￾centration in response to the same stimulus (43).
Cortico-papillary gradient of solutes, another essential pre￾requisite for the antidiuretic effect of AVP, has not yet been,
to our knowledge, completely analyzed in NDI caused by
chronic oral administration of Li. Our finding of decreased
tonicity of papillary tissue (Table IV) suggests that the decreased
tubule-to-interstitium osmotic gradient in Li-rats can contribute
to diminished water reabsorption in the papilla, even if the
AVP-controlled water permeability of tubular epithelium would
be partially preserved. The lower papillary osmolality may also
influence the AVP-dependent cAMP accumulation (3, 15, 29).
In PCD, the decreased osmolality in the medium diminishes
markedly the AVP-dependent cAMP accumulation (29). Con￾sequently, in Li-rats with much lower papillary osmolality
(Table IV), the AVP-dependent cAMP accumulation in PCD
may be further decreased in situ and the differences from the
controls may be even more pronounced than suggested by
comparison in vitro under the same test conditions (Tables V
and VI).
The diminished papillary tonicity is due almost completely
to severely decreased papillary content and low cortico-papillary
gradient of urea in the kidneys of Li-rats (Table IV). The
mechanism by which this renal depletion of urea develops in
Li-rats should be briefly considered. Water diuresis in conscious
rats was shown to lower P, and the cortico-papillary gradient
of urea (44, 45); urea content in the renal cortex is also lower
in HHDI rats with chronic water diuresis (37). Based on other
reports (19, 20) and our survey of Pr, chronic treatment with
oral Li apparently does not diminish GFR. Consequently,
because of low Putk in Li-rats (Table IV), the filtered load of
urea entering renal countercurrent concentrating system (46)
is low in the Li-rats, and this factor alone may account for the
decreased cortico-papillary gradient of this solute. Possibly,
increased renal clearance of urea in Li-rats may result in
depletion of urea from plasma and other body fluids.
The lumen-to-interstitium transport of NaCl in thick as￾cending limb of Henle's loop, namely in MAL, is a major
factor in build-up and maintenance of medullary and papillary
hypertonicity (46). The finding that the rate of 1,4-['4C]succinate
oxidation, linked to NaCl cotransport, was not altered in MAL
Lithium-induced Renal Concentrating Defect 1877

of Li-rats (Fig. 2) suggests, in an indirect way (23, 34), that
NaCi reabsorption in MAL is not impaired. This interpretation
is compatible with unchanged Na' content in the medullary
zone of Li-rats (Table IV). The relatively small drop of Na'
content in papilla of Li-rats (Table IV) could be due to
increased tubular fluid flow and lesser reabsorption of Na' in
MCT and PCD. The markedly lower rate of 1,4-['4C]succinate
oxidation in MCT compared with MAL (Fig. 2) most likely
reflects lower activity of SDH in MCT than in MAL (21).
Unlike in MAL, the 14C02 production in MCT from Li-rats
was increased (Fig. 2). While the functional significance of this
finding is not yet apparent, the observation is consistent with
the histochemical finding of increased SDH in MCT in Li-rats
by Jacobsen et al. (21).
In conclusion, the results of the present study point to two
major factors that may be the underlying cause of the NDI
syndrome consequent to chronic oral administration of Li. As
far as the in vitro studies could be extrapolated to in vivo
situations, our present results suggest that diminished hydroos￾motic response of collecting tubules to AVP is due to a
decreased AVP-dependent accumulation of cAMP in MCT
and PCD, which is similar to some other nephrogenic concen￾trating defects (3), e.g., hereditary NDI in mice (24) and
concentrating defect in adrenal insufficiency (25). However, in
contrast to these two other syndromes (24, 25), the decreased
AVP-stimulated cAMP accumulation in Li-induced NDI is
primarily due to impairment of AVP-dependent cAMP gen￾eration rather than to anomalously high cAMP catabolism
(24, 25). The defect in AVP-sensitive AdC in MCT and PCD
seems to be a consequence of chronic exposure to Li (10, 1 1),
rather than due to chronic polyuria or direct interaction with
Li ions (7, 9). It is not excluded that additional defects exist
also in the cellular steps that are distal to the cAMP generation,
as has been surmised on some past studies (2, 8, 7, 14). The
decrease in papillary tonicity, the urea depletion and low
cortico-papillary gradient in urea in the kidneys of rats treated
chronically with Li, is another substantive factor that can
contribute to a blunted antidiuretic response to AVP (1, 2, 19,
20, 43). Also, possible role of prostaglandins and/or AVP￾inhibiting putative circulating factor (47) in this disorder
remains to be explored.
