INTRODUCTION
Liver transplantation (LT) is a lifesaving procedure and the treatment 
of choice for patients suffering from end-stage liver disease (ESLD). 
The first successful LT in Iran was performed at Shiraz University of 
Medical Sciences in 1992.1
 Since then, several LT programs were de￾veloped throughout the country.2,3 However due to increasing number 
of patients with ESLD, there is a need to expand and develop new 
centers to provide better access to LT for patients with ESLD in Iran. 
This review will address current and future challenges for LT in Iran.
Chronic Liver Disease and Current Status of LT in Iran
Chronic liver diseases including liver cancer are presently the 5th
common etiology of mortality in Iran with more than 8000 deaths per 
year.4,5 The most common cause of ESLD was HBV-related cirrhosis 
until 2005.4
 Following the universal neonatal HBV vaccination in 1992 
and adulthood vaccination in 2005, the incidence of new HBV infection in 
Iran declined dramatically. Presently the most common cause of ESLD 
is cryptogenic cirrhosis, which include mainly steatohepatitis in men 
and autoimmune hepatitis in women.5,6 Cholestatic liver disease espe￾cially primary sclerosing cholangitis is also increasing due to the emer￾gence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) epidemic in Iran.7,8 Hepa￾titis C and alcoholic cirrhosis are not common and the plan for HCV 
eradication with very effective new generation of anti-HCV medication 
would make LT much less common in near future.9

ABSTRACT
Liver transplantation (LT) is a lifesaving procedure and the treatment of choice for patients 
suffering from end-stage liver disease (ESLD). There is increasing number of patients with 
ESLD in Iran. There is a need to expand and develop new centers to provide better access to 
LT for patients with ESLD in Iran. This review will address current and future challenges for 
LT in Iran.

liver disease (NAFLD) is presently the most com￾mon type of liver disease in Iran and its incidence 
is on the rise.9
 ESLD secondary to viral infections, 
autoimmunity, and NAFLD constitute the etiology 
of up to 70% of admissions and mortalities at a ma￾jor academic center in Iran for both sexes.10
Malekzadeh6
 and her colleagues studied more 
than 120,000 deaths in Iran in 2010. Among adults 
aged between 15 to 49 years, the main causes of 
death were gastrointestinal (GI) and liver cancers, 
and cirrhosis. Their findings showed similar results 
even among adults older the 50 years. Sepanlou and 
her colleagues also showed that from 1990 to 2010, 
there were approximately 8000 deaths annually due to 
cirrhosis and its complications in Iran.7
 The authors 
estimated that there were annually 2500 deaths 
because of HBV cirrhosis, 3400 deaths caused by 
NAFLD, 1600 deaths caused by HCV cirrhosis, 
and 500 deaths due to cholestatic liver disease in 
Iran.7
 Current data (figure 1) showed that during 
1990-2015 the prevalence and mortality of liver 
diseases in Iran is on the rise.11
A recent study at Shiraz University of Medical 
Sciences in Iran showed a similar trend (table 1). 
HBV and cryptogenic cirrhosis (most likely due to 
NAFLD) were the most common indications for LT 
at this center.1
Since the Iranian Parliament passed Donation 
after Brain Death Act in 2000, there has been ex￾pansion of deceased donations in Iran. Currently, 
per million donations is 10.9
 which ranked Iran 26th
in the world (figure 2).
The first LT program in Iran was established at 
Nemazee Hospital in Shiraz. Currently, there are

seven programs in the country. There have been 
more than 4500 cases of LT performed in Iran. The 
number of LT performed in the country is currently 
around 800 cases annually (figure 3).
Most LTs are from deceased donors, although 
some cases of live donor liver transplantation have 
been performed too (figure 4). The rate of deceased 
donation especially liver allograft donation per mil￾lion is on the rise in Iran (figure 5). Table 1 shows 
overall LT activities in different programs in Iran.
LT in Iran: Challenges and Opportunities
There are several LT programs in Shiraz, Tehran, 
Mashhad, Kerman, and Isfahan.1-3 However, most of the 
provinces do not have a program. Approximately 800 
LTs are annually performed, which is well below current 
need.1-3 To guarantee access to LT for all Iranian patients 
with ESLD in need of this life-saving service, there is 
a need to have more centers throughout the country. 
There has been a good progress in the past two decades to 
expand access to transplantation in Iran such as develop￾ment of deceased donor program in addition to live dona￾tion. However, there are several challenges to expand the 
access to LT in Iran as follows:
1- Lack of a national transplantation system
Although there are several LT programs in Iran, there 
is no national transplantation system to coordinate the 
transplantation activities. Each program is currently 
functioning independently and there is limited coopera￾tion and collaboration among the centers. There is no 
registry system and database for LT in Iran. This issue 
makes quantitative and qualitative assessment more 
difficult. There is a need to develop a stronger national 
transplantation system to coordinate the care, improve 
the quality, and provide national organ sharing.

2- Lack of legal platform
The only national law regarding organ donation and 
transplantation was passed by the Parliament 17 years 
ago, which authorized the utilization of organs from 
brain-dead donors for transplantation.3
 There is a need to 
have a legal platform to develop a national transplanta￾tion system. Historically, 1984 National Transplant Act 
in the US led to creation of the United Network for Or￾gan Sharing (UNOS) and expansion of transplantation.12
European countries also followed the same path, which 
led to formation of Eurotransplant network.13 There is 
also such a need in Iran. We hope that with cooperation 
between executive and legislative branches such a legal 
platform would be established. This would lead to es￾tablishment of an organized national organ procurement 
and transplantation network in Iran. Such a network will 
also help to improve the quality and access of the patients 
to transplantation care especially LT.
3- Lack of national organ procurement and trans￾plantation registry
Quality data are essential for future planning. Each 
individual program in Iran has its own database. How￾ever there is a need to a national database. All the LT 
programs should be required by law to provide their 
data. This database can be used to improve the quality, 
identify the problems, and plan for possible solution to 
improve patients’ care.
4- Need to increase public awareness regarding 
organ donation
There has been a significant progress regarding organ 
donation in Iran. Donors per million population (PMP) 
has increased to 25 in recent years.14 There have been 
5000 brain-dead donors in Iran last year. However only 
1500 proceeded to organ donation due to low conversion 
rate.15 There is a need to increase public awareness re￾garding organ donation. There is still no deceased donor 
program in several provinces in Iran.3
 Increase in public 
awareness and development of more deceased donation 
networks throughout the country would lead to improve 
public access to transplantation in Iran. 
5- Lack of adequate liver transplantation centers
Iran has several LT programs in Shiraz, Tehran, 
Mashhad, Kerman, and Isfahan.1-3 Excluding the centers 
at Shiraz University of Medical Sciences and Tehran 
University of Medical Sciences,1,2 the remaining centers 
are low volume.3
 These centers cannot provide adequate 
care to all patients with ESLD. There is a need to develop 
several other centers in different geographic locations to 
ensure access of all patients with ESLD to LT. This will re￾quire financial support and adequate professional personnel. 
6- Lack of adequate training programs
There is a need to ensure training of enough expe￾rienced and professional personnel to expand access to 
LT in Iran. There are very few such training programs.1,2 
There are only two approved surgical transplantation 
fellowships in the country. There should be enough 
programs to train nurses, physicians, and allied health 
professionals regarding the transplantation in general 
and especially for LT.
7- Financial and insurance issues
LT is a lifesaving and expensive procedure. Almost 
85% of the costs of liver transplantations are covered by 
the government’s insurance. The post-transplantation 
care is also expensive especially the cost of life-long 
immunosuppression, which is also partially covered by 
the insurance. There should be a national effort to sup￾port patients in need of LT financially with adequate 
insurance coverage.
In summary, there is an increased need for LT in Iran. 
A national organ procurement and transplantation net￾work is required to meet this need, improve the quality of 
care and access to LT for all patients with ESLD in Iran.
