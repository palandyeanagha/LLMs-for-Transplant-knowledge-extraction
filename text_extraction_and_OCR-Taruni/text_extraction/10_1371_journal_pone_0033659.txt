Abstract
Background & Aims: Patients coinfected with HIV-1 and HCV develop more rapid liver fibrosis than patients monoinfected
with HCV. HIV RNA levels correlate with fibrosis progression implicating HIV directly in the fibrotic process. While activated
hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) express the 2 major HIV chemokine coreceptors, CXCR4 and CCR5, little is known about the pro￾fibrogenic effects of the HIV-1 envelope protein, gp120, on HSCs. We therefore examined the in vitro impact of X4 gp120 on
HSC activation, collagen I expression, and underlying signaling pathways and examined the in vivo expression of gp120 in
HIV/HCV coinfected livers.
Methods: Primary human HSCs and LX-2 cells, a human HSC line, were challenged with X4 gp120 and expression of
fibrogenic markers assessed by qRT-PCR and Western blot +/2 either CXCR4-targeted shRNA or anti-CXCR4 neutralizing
antibody. Downstream intracellular signaling pathways were evaluated with Western blot and pre-treatment with specific
pathway inhibitors. Gp120 immunostaining was performed on HIV/HCV coinfected liver biopsies.
Results: X4 gp 120 significantly increased expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) and collagen I in HSCs which
was blocked by pre-incubation with either CXCR4-targeted shRNA or anti-CXCR4 neutralizing antibody. Furthermore, X4
gp120 promoted Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 phosphorylation and pretreatment with an ERK inhibitor
attenuated HSC activation and collagen I expression. Sinusoidal staining for gp120 was evident in HIV/HCV coinfected livers.
Conclusions: X4 HIV-1 gp120 is pro-fibrogenic through its interactions with CXCR4 on activated HSCs. The availability of
small molecule inhibitors to CXCR4 make this a potential anti-fibrotic target in HIV/HCV coinfected patients.

Introduction
HIV prevalence in the US is increasing due to a combination of
the stable incidence of HIV (estimated at 53,600 new cases per
year in 2006) and longer life expectancy due to effective
antiretroviral therapies (ART) [1]. As HIV patients continue to
live longer in the setting of effective ART, liver disease has become
the leading cause of non-AIDS related mortality [2]. Due to
shared routes of transmission, HCV and HBV are common in
HIV-infected patients though ethanol-induced liver disease is also
prevalent. Approximately 300,000 individuals in the US are
coinfected with HCV and HIV [3,4]. Median time to cirrhosis in
HIV/HCV coinfected patients is approximately 12 years shorter
than HCV monoinfected patients [5,6]. While immune dysregu￾lation in the setting of HIV infection may play a role in
accelerating liver fibrosis from HCV, recent studies suggest faster
fibrosis progression in HIV/HCV coinfected patients despite
effective anti-retroviral therapy [7]. Furthermore, while separating
the impact of decreased CD4 count from HIV RNA levels is
difficult, cohort studies suggest independent effects of HIV RNA
on fibrosis progression [1,8,9]. In one study, a dose-dependent
effect of HIV RNA levels on fibrosis progression rates was
observed, further implicating the virus in enhanced liver
fibrogenesis [8].
The liver is unique in that the majority of its blood flow is
derived from the portal circulation. As blood enters the liver, it is
distributed through the hepatic sinusoids, which are lined by a
uniquely fenestrated endothelium. HSCs reside between the
fenestrated endothelial cells and hepatocytes. Consequently, the
low pressure flow combined with the fenestrations within the
sinusoids create an environment that is primed for interactions
between gut-derived pathogens, intrahepatic cell populations, and
circulating cells of the immune system. Hepatic fibrosis is a wound￾healing process that occurs when the liver is chronically injured. A
central mediator of this fibrotic process is the activated HSC [10].
With liver injury, this normally quiescent cell is transformed into a
myofibroblastic cell that is fibrogenic, proliferative, and contractile
[10]. This transformation process or ‘‘activation’’ is believed to
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 March 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 3 | e33659

occur in 2 phases: Initiation and Perpetuation. Initiation occurs in
response to factors such as oxidative stress, hepatocellular injury/
apoptosis, and LPS [11]. Once activated, the HSC becomes
responsive to paracrine stimuli such as transforming growth factor￾beta 1 (TGF- ß1) [12] and a number of autocrine pathways are set
in motion [13]. This process is dynamic and once the HSC is
‘‘activated’’, additional factors/stimuli can further accentuate
features of activation such as production of collagen I and
perpetuate this phenotype.
The chemokine receptors, CCR5 and CXCR4, are co-receptors
for R5-tropic and X4-tropic HIV-1, respectively [14]. The HIV
envelope protein, gp120, from R5-tropic HIV-1 binds CCR5
while gp120 from X4-tropic HIV-1 binds CXCR4. Gp120 is
capable of eliciting biologic effects in target cells even in the
absence of true infection [15]. While numerous studies have
examined the effects of gp120 on target cells, little in known about
the effects of gp120 on intrahepatic cell populations. X4 HIV-1
gp120 promotes hepatocyte apoptosis [16] and both X4 and R5
gp120 act cooperatively with the HCV E2 glycoprotein to
promote hepatocyte apoptosis and secretion of the pro-inflamma￾tory cytokine, IL-8 in vitro [17]. More recently, it was shown that
both X4 and R5 gp120 promote TGF-ß1 production by HCV
replicon cells through interactions with CXCR4 and CCR5 [18].
While both hepatocyte apoptosis and TGFß1 promote HSC
activation and fibrogenesis, little is known about the direct effects
of gp120 on activated HSCs.
The direct effect of viral proteins on HSCs has been previously
demonstrated. Both HCV [19,20,21] and HBV proteins [22]
modulate the biology of activated HSCs potentially impacting on
the progression of liver fibrosis. Activated HSCs express both HIV-1
chemokine coreceptors, CXCR4 and CCR5 [23,24] and we have
already established that expression of CXCR4 is increased in HCV￾infected livers [24] and increases with culture-induced HSC
activation [24]. Moreover, stromal cell-derived factor-1 alpha
(SDF-1a), the endogenous ligand for CXCR4, promotes HSC
collagen I expression, activation, and proliferation [24]. We have
also shown that HIV infection of activated HSCs in vitro is associated
with upregulation of collagen I and the pro-inflammatory
chemokine, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1) [25]. It is
not clear whether these effects require infection or result from
extracellular gp120 interactions with CXCR4 and CCR5. Bruno et
al. demonstrated that primarily R5 gp120 promoted MCP-1 and
IL-6 secretion, TIMP-1 expression, and the directional migration of
HSCs [26] suggesting that HIV envelope protein can elicit pro￾inflammatory and to a lesser extent pro-fibrogenic effects in
activated HSCs through interactions with CCR5.
HIV-1 gp120, can arise from infectious viral particles, defective
virions, or freely circulating soluble proteins that have been shed
from virions. Tissue concentrations are disproportionately higher
than plasma levels, persist even when patients are on effective
ART, and may be underestimated by current techniques used to
measure them [27,28,29]. The expression of gp120 in liver tissue
has not been previously reported.
The aims of this study were to determine the effect of X4 gp120 on
HSC activation and collagen I expression through interactions with
CXCR4, explore underlying intracellular signaling pathways, and
determine whether gp120 is present in liver tissue from HIV/HCV
coinfected patients prior to initiation of anti-retroviral therapy.
Materials and Methods
Reagents
Recombinant HIV-1 HXB gp120 was kindly provided by Dr.
Robert Doms (Univ of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA) and AT-2
treated HIV-IIIB was provided by Dr. J. Lifson through the NIH
AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of
AIDS, NIAID. Phosphorylation-specific polyclonal antibodies
against extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt (Ser
473) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly,
Massachusetts, USA). The ERK inhibitor UO126 was purchased
from Merck Chemicals (Nottingham,UK).
Isolation and culture of primary human HSCs
Primary HSCs were isolated from normal liver margins in
patients undergoing hepatic resection for primary benign tumors
or a single metastasis from colon cancer, as previously described
[24]. Briefly, immediately post-hepatectomy, an isolated liver
section was washed and the portal vessels cannulated for in-situ
digestion with pronase (Roche Applied Sciences GmbH, Mann￾heim, Germany) and collagenase B (Roche Applied Sciences),
followed by density gradient centrifugation. HSC purity was
consistently found to be between 95–99% with a viability of 95%.
HSCs were plated on plastic in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle
Medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with
10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) in a 5% CO2 humidified
atmosphere. HSCs were activated by culturing on plastic for 7–
12 days and subcultured to passage 3 for all experiments.
Cells lines
LX-2 cells, an immortalized human hepatic stellate cell line,
were cultured and characterized as previously described [30]. For
the studies focused on determining the impact of HIV X4 gp120
protein on the activation and expression of collagen I, cells were
serum starved for 12–24 hours prior to X4 gp120 challenge. To
confirm that gp120 effects were CD4-independent, HSCs were
pre-incubated with 25 mg/mL anti-CD4 (BD Biosciences, clone
Leu 3A) for 30 minutes prior to challenge with X4 gp120.
Reverse-Transcription and Real-time quantitative PCR
(qRT-PCR)
RNA was extracted from the cells and reverse transcribed into
cDNA using RNeasyH kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and Omniscript
RT Kit (Qiagen), respectively. mRNA levels were analyzed by
qRT-PCR using SYBR green qRT-PCR Master Mix (Roche) on
the LightCyclerH480 System (Roche). Primer sequences are listed
in Table S1.
Knockdown of CXCR4 in Hepatic Stellate Cells
CXCR4 knockdown was accomplished using short hairpin
RNA (shRNA). Primary human HSCs were grown in 6-well
culture plates to 60–70% confluence. Cells were transfected with
either shCXCR4 (Sigma, St. Louis, Catalog #SH0221) (or a
shRNA control vector (pLKO.1, Sigma Catalog # SHC001) using
TransIT-LT1 reagent (Mirus Bio, Madison, WI). After 6 hours,
the medium was replaced with normal growth medium for
72 hours which leads to maximal knockdown of CXCR4 [24].
Immunoblots
Cell extracts were prepared by pelleting the cells with lysis
buffer (Roche Applied Sciences) containing protease and phos￾phatase inhibitors. (Roche Applied Sciences and Thermo
Scientific). Protein concentration were determined with the
Bradford method using Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad).
Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE,
transferred to Hybond C membranes, and immunoblotted with
specific primary antibodies for collagen I (Rockland Immuno￾chemicals, Inc., Gilbertsville, PA), a-SMA (Promega), and ß-actin

(Sigma), and visualized using a secondary antibody conjugated to
horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (GE Healthcare) and revealed with
a Western chemiluminescent HRP substrate detection system
(Millipore Billerica, MA).
Immunohistochemistry
For gp120 staining, deidentified, formalin-fixed, paraffin￾embedded liver biopsies were obtained from HIV/HCV coinfect￾ed patients as part of their standard of care and provided by the
Mount Sinai Department of Pathology with the approval of
Mount Sinai IRB (GCO# 05-1343). 5 mm tissue sections were
sequentially deparaffinized followed by autoclaving for epitope
retrieval. Tissues were then blocked for 1 hr in 5% BSA/PBS at
room temperature and incubated in primary antibody overnight at
4uC with a 1:100 dilution of mouse monoclonal anti-gp120
(Advanced Bioscience Laboratories, Inc., Kensington MD or
Abcam, Cambridge, MA). This antibody cross-reacts with the
gp120 of a number of both X4 and R5-tropic HIV-1 isolates.
Sections were revealed using DAKO EnVision HRP-DAB kit and
counterstained with hematoxylin. For negative staining controls,
the tissue sections were incubated with isotype control antibody.
Statistical Analysis
All results are expressed as the mean +/2 standard deviation.
Statistical significance was tested using unpaired Student t test, and
P,0.05 was considered significant.
Ethics Statement
For primary cell isolation and immunohistochemistry, deidentified
waste or archived tissue, respectively, was provided to the
investigators. The Mount Sinai IRB exempted this study from review
(Exempt Category #4) because samples were considered waste or
archived material and waived the need for consent due to the fact that
the samples received were deidentified and the investigators had no
way of tracking the samples back to the individual patient.
Results
X4 HIV-1 gp120 promotes expression of fibrogenic
markers in activated human hepatic stellate cells
The HIV envelope protein, gp120, has been shown to promote
hepatocyte apoptosis, hepatocellular secretion of the pro-inflam￾matory cytokine IL-8 [17], elicit pro-inflammatory and to a lesser
extent pro-fibrogenic effects on HSCs, and promote the
directional migration of hepatic HSCs [26]. As expression of
CXCR4 increases with HSC activation, we examined the pro￾fibrogenic effects of X4 tropic gp120 on activated HSCs. LX-2
cells were treated with X4 gp120 (HXB) and fibrogenic markers
examined by qRT-PCR. As shown in Figure 1A, X4 gp120
resulted in a significant increase in collagen I, a-SMA, and type I
TGF-ß receptor (TßRI) expression after 2 hours which was not
blocked by pre-incubation with anti-CD4 antibody. The effect of
X4 gp120 on collagen I a1 mRNA levels was further confirmed in
passage #3 primary HSCs (Figure 1B). In addition, AT-2 treated
HIV IIIB (X4-tropic), which maintains the gp120 in its natural
oligomeric conformation, also resulted in a significant increase in
collagen I a1 mRNA expression (Fig. 1C). These results suggest
direct pro-fibrogenic effects of X4 gp120 on HSCs.
X4 HIV-1 gp120 promotes a-SMA and collagen I
expression in activated Human Stellate Cells
The protein expression of both a-SMA, a marker of activated
HSCs, and collagen I was further assessed by Western blot. Both
LX-2 and primary human HSCs demonstrated increased a-SMA
and collagen I protein expression peaking at 6–8 hours after
gp120 treatment compared with control (Fig. 2 A–C). These
results confirm the direct pro-fibrogenic effects of X4 gp120 on
HSCs.
X4 gp120 induction of a-SMA and collagen I expression is
CXCR4-dependent
To determine whether gp120 induction of a-SMA and collagen
I were CXCR4-dependent, two approaches were utilized. First,
CXCR4 was knocked down using CXCR4-targeting shRNA
(shCXCR4) vs. non-targeting shRNA (shControl) followed by
treatment with X4 gp120. We have previously shown that peak
reduction in CXCR4 protein expression occurs 72 hours after
transfection [24], which was again confirmed for experiments
outlined here (Figure 3A). Therefore, cells were treated with X4
gp120 or HIV IIIB 72 hours after treatment with shCXCR4. By
qRT-PCR a greater than 40% reduction in a-SMA and collagen I
mRNA was observed while a 70% reduction in a-SMA and
collagen I protein levels were seen by Western blot in the presence
of shCXCR4 (Fig. 3B,C). Furthermore, preincubation of human
primary HSCs with anti-CXCR4 neutralizing antibody for
30 min prior to X4 gp120 treatment resulted in an attenuation
of X4 gp120-mediated a-SMA and collagen I induction (Fig. 3D).
Taken together, these results indicate that X4 gp120 induction of
a-SMA and collagen I expression in HSCs occurs in a CXCR4-
dependent fashion.
X4 gp120 induction of collagen I occurs via the ERK 1/2
pathway
We next explored the intracellular signaling pathways respon￾sible for the biological effects of X4 gp120 on collagen I expression
in HSCs. Both ERK 1/2 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt
(PI3K-Akt) pathways are important for mediating effects of SDF￾1a on collagen expression in HSCs via CXCR4 [24]. We therefore
examined whether X4 gp120 induces phosphorylation of ERK 1/
2 and Akt in primary HSCs by Western blot. Treatment with
gp120 induced phosphorylation of ERK 1/2 but not Akt (Fig. 4 A,
B). Moreover, pretreatment with the ERK inhibitor (UO126;
10 nM for 30 min) significantly decreased X4 gp120-induced
collagen I in HSCs (Fig. 4C). These data implicate the ERK 1/2
pathway in promoting X4 gp120 induced collagen expression in
HSCs.
Gp120 is present in liver tissue from HIV/HCV infected
patients
Numerous studies have examined the effect of gp120 on
intrahepatic cell populations, but the expression of gp120 in
human liver samples has not been reported. We therefore
examined the expression of gp120 in liver biopsies from 3 HIV/
HCV coinfected patients prior to the initiation of combined anti￾retroviral therapy. Immunohistochemistry for gp120 on paraffin￾embedded liver biopsies from HIV/HCV coinfected patients
demonstrated sinusoidal staining in all 3 patients (Fig. 5). While
the cellular source of the gp120 requires further investigation,
gp120 is present in the sinusoid where stellate cells reside as well as
in areas of portal inflammation.
Discussion
We have previously established that activated HSCs express
CXCR4 in HCV-infected livers [24], culture-induced HSC
activation leads to increased CXCR4 expression [24], and the

endogenous ligand for CXCR4, SDF-1a, elicits pro-fibrogenic
effects in activated HSCs. We have also demonstrated that HIV
infection of HSCs is associated with increased collagen I
expression but in the current study we show that X4 gp120, the
envelope protein of X4-tropic HIV-1, can promote HSC
activation and collagen I expression in HSCs even in the absence
of infection through its interactions with CXCR4. While other in
vitro studies have utilized gp120 to examine effects on intrahepatic
cell populations, we show for the first time that gp120 is present in
the livers of patients with HIV/HCV coinfection. Since the

with X4 HIV-1 gp120 at a final concentration of 500 ng/ml for 2 hours, RNA harvested, reverse transcribed, and qRT-PCR performed for TGF-ß1, type I
TGF-ß receptor, a-SMA and coll I (a1) mRNA levels. To confirm X4 gp120 effects were CD4-independent, cells were pre-incubated with 25 mg/mL anti￾CD4 30 minutes prior to challenge with X4 gp120. (B, C) Effect on collagen I (a1) was confirmed in primary HSCs with both X4 gp120 as well as AT-2
treated X4-tropic HIV-IIIB, which presents gp120 in its oligomeric confirmation. All data are expressed as means +/2 standard deviation of at least
three independent experiments.

number of cells infected by HIV in vivo is low compared to
circulating and tissue concentrations of viral proteins and non￾infectious virion particles exist in excess of infectious virus, the
interaction between HIV gp120 and HSCs may be highly relevant
and targetable.
It has been reported that R5 gp120 promotes the secretion of
IL-6 and MCP-1 by HSCs, promotes the chemotaxis of HSCs,
and to a lesser extent exerts some pro-fibrogenic effects. Its
chemotactic effects were found to be mediated through PI3K/Akt
pathways while its pro-inflammatory effects were mediated
through NF-kB and p38MAPK [26]. According to this report, IIIB
(X4-tropic) gp120 induced HSC migration less effectively than R5
tropic gp120 and therefore the authors focused more on R5 gp120
effects. R5-tropic virus predominates early in infection while X4-
tropic HIV emerges later in the course of disease and is associated
with rapid HIV disease progression. In this study, we focused on
the effect of X4-tropic gp120 and found that the ERK 1/2
pathway was important for collagen I induction while activation of
the PI3K/Akt pathway was not observed. It is possible that R5
gp120 exerts more pro-inflammatory effects while X4 gp120 is
more pro-fibrogenic and requires further investigation. Interest￾ingly, the endogenous ligand for CXCR4, SDF-1a, induced
collagen I expression in activated HSCs through both ERK 1/2
and PI3K/Akt pathways [24]. While X4 gp120 and SDF-1a can
activate similar pathways, they can activate different pathways
depending on cell type and context [31,32]. Given the significant
impact of gp120 on the protein expression of a-SMA and collagen
I and the modest increase in mRNA levels, it is likely that post￾transcriptional factors are predominantly involved. While classi￾cally the ERK1/2 pathway regulates genes at the transcriptional
level, over 180 targets have been identified including cytoskeletal
proteins, signaling proteins, etc [33]. Moreover, while collagen I
production by activated hepatic stellate cells is partially regulated
at the transcriptional level, there is increasing evidence for
translational regulation. For example, leucine upregulates collagen
I production in hepatic stellate cells at the translational level and
involves the ERK-1/2 pathway [34]. Future studies will need to
dissect the exact mechanism by which gp120 upregulates collagen
I expression via the ERK1/2 pathway.

One critical issue is whether concentrations used to elicit
biologic effects in vitro are present in vivo. Because of the presence of
anti-gp120 abs, the effective amount of gp120 available for
binding to receptor in the plasma of HIV infected patients is very
low [35]. However, tissue concentrations are disproportionately
higher than plasma levels, persist even when patients are on
effective ART, and may be underestimated by current techniques
used to measure them [27,28,29]. The hepatic concentration of
gp120 in HIV patients is not known, yet many studies have
examined the in vitro effects of gp120 on hepatic cell types
[16,18,36]. In the current study, we demonstrate for the first time
the presence of gp120 both in areas of portal inflammation as well
as in the sinusoidal space of livers in patients with HIV/HCV
coinfection. Since this antibody cross-reacts with the gp120 of a
number of X4 and R5-tropic isolates, it is not clear whether X4,
R5, or both are present in these particular samples and future
studies using carefully phenotyped patient samples will be needed
to specifically determine whether fibrogenic effects are more
attributable to X4 or R5 gp120. The potential cellular sources of
gp120 include Kupffer cells, CD4 cells, sinusoidal endothelial cells,
and stellate cells; though the most likely candidate are Kupffer cells
since they are the only hepatic cell type clearly shown to be
infected by HIV in vivo and in vitro [37,38]. Nevertheless, the
presence of gp120 in the sinusoid suggests that gp120 interactions
with CXCR4 or CCR5 on HSCs is likely. In addition, future
studies with a large number of patient samples will allow us to
quantify gp120 levels and correlate with HSC activation and
fibrosis in patients with HIV/HCV and HIV monoinfection. We
postulate that any underlying chronic liver injury results in stellate
cell activation and increased CXCR4 and CCR5 expression. Due
to shared routes of transmission, HCV is the most common co￾factor but toxicity from ARVs, alcohol, and steatosis are additional
factors important factors in promoting stellate cell activation in
HIV monoinfected patients. Therefore, HIV gp120 may further
enhance HSC activation and ECM production accelerating
progression of liver fibrosis induced by HCV and other forms of
chronic liver injury. In two recent studies [39,40], HIV viremia
was associated with liver fibrosis in HIV monoinfected patients
highlighting the potential importance of HIV interactions with
hepatic stellate cells even in the absence of a hepatotrophic virus
and therefore the importance of targeting this interaction
therapeutically. Our findings add support to the early initiation
of ARVs in patients with any underlying chronic liver injury or
specific targeting of the gp120-chemokine co-receptor interaction.
In addition to direct effects of X4 gp120 in upregulating
collagen I expression in HSCs, we found that X4 gp120
significantly increased TßRI expression and a trend toward
increased TGF-ß1 expression by qRT-PCR was also observed.
TGF-ß1 is the most profibrogenic cytokine in chronic liver disease
and is elevated in the serum of HIV-infected patients [41]. A trend
toward increased intrahepatic expression of TGF-ß1 in HIV/
HCV coinfected livers was also reported [42]. As others have

density of 26104 cells/well in 6-well plates, serum-starved for 24 hours, and then transfected with shCXCR4 or shControl. A 75% reduction in CXCR4
protein expression was noted 72 hours after transfection by Western blot. (B) 72 hours after shControl or sh CXCR4 transfection, primary HSCs were
then challenged with X4 gp120 for 2 hours, RNA harvested, reverse transcribed and qRT-PCR performed for CXCR4, a-SMA, and coll I (a1). A 40–50%
reduction in gp120-induced collagen (a1) and a-SMA mRNA levels was observed with CXCR4 knockdown. Data are expressed as the mean 6 standard
deviation of three independent experiments. (C) 72 hours after shCXCR4 knockdown, HSCs were challenged with HIV-IIIB for 8 hours and cell lysates
used for Western blot where a 70% reduction in the protein expression of both a-SMA and collagen I was observed. (D) Human primary HSCs were
pretreated with anti-CXCR4 antibody for 30 min (20 mg/ml) followed by treatment with gp120 (500 ng/mL) for 8 hours. Both X4 gp120-induced a￾SMA and coll I protein expression were attenuated by anti-CXCR4 neutralizing antibody. ß-actin, a-tubulin, and GAPDH were used as loading controls.

reported that both X4 and R5 gp120 induce TGF-ß1 by HCV
replicon cells [18], these findings suggest that X4 gp120 may
promote fibrosis both directly and via induction of TGF-ß1 by
both parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells of the liver.
In summary, we demonstrate that gp120 is present in HIV/
HCV coinfected livers and X4 gp120 elicits pro-fibrogenic effects
on activated HSCs via a direct interaction with CXCR4. The
availability of small molecule inhibitors to CXCR4 make this a
potential anti-fibrotic target in HIV/HCV coinfected patients.

Figure 4. X4 gp120 induction of collagen I occurs via the ERK 1/2 pathway. (A, B) To determine whether X4 gp120 activates PI3K-Akt and/or
ERK 1/2 pathways, primary HSCs were incubated with 500 ng/ml of X4 gp120 and levels of phospho-Akt and phospho-ERK 1/2 assessed by Western
blot. An increase in phospho-ERK 1/2 was seen while no increase in phospho-Akt was seen in response to X4 gp120. (C) Pretreatment of cells with
ERK inhibitor (UO126; 10 nM) 30 minutes prior to gp120 treatment resulted in a marked decrease in X4 gp120-induced collagen I protein expression
in HSCs. ß-tubulin and total ERK1/2 were used as loading controls. Representative Western blots of three independent experiments with normalized
densitometric units shown.

Figure 5. Gp120 is present in liver tissue from HIV/HCV
infected patients. Paraffin-embedded liver biopsies from HIV/HCV
coinfected patients prior to initiation of ART were immunostained with
monoclonal anti-gp120 or isotype control. Sinusoidal staining was
appreciated in all 3 specimens. Representative images shown (Magni￾fication 1006, 6306). Viral load ranges: HIV RNA levels ranged from
514–2,455 copies/ml; HCV RNA levels ranged from 1.2 million–1.6
million IU/ml.
