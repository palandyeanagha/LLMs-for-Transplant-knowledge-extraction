Abstract
The presence of self-reactive IgG autoantibodies in human sera is largely thought to represent a breakdown in central
tolerance and is typically regarded as a harbinger of autoimmune pathology. In the present study, immune-response
profiling of human serum from 166 individuals via human protein microarrays demonstrates that IgG autoantibodies are
abundant in all human serum, usually numbering in the thousands. These IgG autoantibodies bind to human antigens from
organs and tissues all over the body and their serum diversity is strongly influenced by age, gender, and the presence of
specific diseases. We also found that serum IgG autoantibody profiles are unique to an individual and remarkably stable
over time. Similar profiles exist in rat and swine, suggesting conservation of this immunological feature among mammals.
The number, diversity, and apparent evolutionary conservation of autoantibody profiles suggest that IgG autoantibodies
have some important, as yet unrecognized, physiological function. We propose that IgG autoantibodies have evolved as an
adaptive mechanism for debris-clearance, a function consistent with their apparent utility as diagnostic indicators of disease
as already established for Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.

Introduction
Since the discovery of auto-reactive, natural antibodies more
than two decades ago, a great deal of effort has been devoted to
describing their generation, regulation, and function Much of this
effort has focused on natural IgM antibodies. It has been
determined that natural IgM antibodies are present in experi￾mental animals completely deprived of potential antigen, and that
their reactivity profiles are remarkably conserved between
individuals [1–3]. These natural IgMs have also been shown to
be universally present in human serum [4,5]. The fact that some of
these natural antibodies are auto-reactive has led to suspicions that
they might function in maintaining tissue homeostasis [6,7].
Subsequent investigations determined that IgM autoantibodies do
indeed bind to common apoptotic neo-antigens, such as phospha￾tidylserine, cardiolipin, and annexin IV, and that they also
recognize markers of cell senescence [8–12]. Given these patterns
of reactivity, it is hypothesized that natural IgM antibodies serve as
a conserved way to assist in the clean-up of apoptotic cellular
debris.
Natural IgM antibodies are produced by the relatively class￾restricted B-1 cells, while IgG antibodies are known to be
produced via the T cell-dependent interactions of follicular B-2
cells [13]. The former are positively selected for when faced with
self-antigen, while the latter is thought to be strictly held within the
confines of self-tolerance [14]. Therefore, any presence of IgG
autoantibodies in the blood is usually considered to be the result of
a pathological breakdown in self-tolerance. This notion is
supported by the fact that many autoimmune diseases, including
rheumatoid arthritis, Sjo¨gren’s syndrome, and systemic lupus
erythematosis, are initiated or exacerbated by IgG autoantibodies
to specific cellular and tissue components [15-17]. Thus, it is still
generally assumed that all auto-reactive IgG are not purposeful
products of the human immune system.
Although IgG autoantibodies in the blood can be a serological
hallmark of autoimmune diseases, the low specificity of most of
these disease-associations implies the presence of autoantibodies
even in healthy individuals. An increasing number of studies have
also revealed a link between autoantibodies and many non￾autoimmune phenomena, like cancer and neurological disease

[7,15–18]. New serum autoantibodies are continuously being
identified in the literature as related to various conditions, but
most attempts to connect them more directly to known risk factors,
pathogenesis, or prognosis are tenuous. This is often compounded
by limited study methodologies and a singular focus on one
individual disease process. A systemic investigation into the extent
of natural serum IgG autoantibodies may help provide us with a
clearer understanding of the role of these autoantibodies and their
relationship with disease.
To accomplish this, we probed protein microarrays containing
nearly 10,000 human proteins with sera collected from individuals
of different ages, genders, and pathological states. All samples
contained auto-reactive IgG, and the majority possessed autoan￾tibodies to more than one thousand discrete human protein
antigens. The total number detected was significantly influenced
by gender, age, and the presence of specific diseases. Furthermore,
the unique profile of autoantibodies present in an individual was
relatively consistent over time. Rats and swine were also found to
possess serum IgG autoantibodies and demonstrated similar
stability in individual IgG autoantibody profiles over time. The
number, diversity, and apparent conservation of IgG autoanti￾bodies in mammals have led us to suggest that abundant IgG
autoantibodies are a normal feature of the blood and, like auto￾reactive IgM, they may play an important physiological role such
as maintaining tissue homeostasis through adaptive debris￾clearance as suggested by Avrameas nearly two decades ago [6].
Indirect evidence in support of this concept comes from our recent
studies showing that small panels of disease-specific autoantibod￾ies, presumably linked to debris clearance, can be used for the
detection and diagnosis of diseases such as Alzheimer’s and
Parkinson’s diseases [19,20].
Materials and Methods
Human Serum Samples
Healthy control sera were purchased from the following
vendors: Analytical Biological Systems, Inc. (Wilmington, DE), Bioserve
(Beltsville, MD) and Asterand, Inc. (Detroit, MI). Parkinson’s disease
(PD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) serum samples were obtained
from Analytical Biological Systems, Inc. (Wilmington, DE), ProteoGenex
(Culver City, CA) and PrecisionMed (Solana Beach, CA). Breast
cancer (BC) and multiple sclerosis (MS) serum samples were
obtained from Asterand, Inc. All samples were handled by standard
procedures and stored at -80uC. Demographic characteristics of
the study population are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Approval for
the use of blood samples for this study was obtained from the
UMDNJ-Stratford Institutional Review Board.
Human Protein Microarrays
To assess the complexity of autoantibody profiles in human
serum, we used human protein microarrays (Cat. No.
PAH0525020, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), each containing
9,486 full-length human protein antigens (www.invitrogen.com/
protoarray). All proteins have been expressed as GST fusion
proteins in insect cells, purified under native conditions, and
spotted in duplicate onto nitrocellulose-coated glass slides. All
arrays were probed and scanned according to the manufacturer’s
instructions using commercially prepared reagents. Briefly, micro￾array slides were blocked (Blocking Buffer, Cat. No. PA055,
Invitrogen) and then incubated with serum samples diluted 1:500 in
washing buffer. After washing, the arrays were probed with anti￾human IgG (H+L) conjugated to AlexaFluor 647 (Cat. No. A￾21445, Invitrogen). Arrays were then washed, dried, and immedi￾ately scanned with a GenePix 4000B Fluorescence Scanner
(Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
Protein Microarray Data Analysis
The fluorescence data for each microarray was acquired by
Genepix Pro analysis software after scanning. The resulting Genepix
Results (GPR) files were then imported into Invitrogen’s Prospector
5.2 for analysis. Background subtraction and outlier detection
were all performed by the ‘compare’ function of Prospector. The Z￾Factor for a pair of protein features indicates how far the mean of
that feature pair deviates from the mean of the negative controls in
each sub-array. A Z-factor of greater than 0.4 was used to define a
positive signal. Redundant BSA spots within each sub-array served
as negative controls, with a required signal of less than 1000 RFUs
to be considered valid for this study. All data is MIAME compliant
and the raw data has been deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus
(GEO) under acquisition number GSE39087 (http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/geo/). Cross-group comparison of the number of
autoantibodies was done using the Student’s t-test.

Dot Blot Analysis
Purified recombinant human ICAM4 (0.134 mg/ml) and
PTCD2 (0.098 mg/ml) proteins (Cat. No. TP300636 and
TP315253, OriGene Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD), were spotted
onto a nitrocellulose membrane in 1 ml volumes. The proteins
were blocked in 5% non-fat milk for one hour at room
temperature (RT) and then probed with serially diluted (1:500,
1:1000 and 1:2000) human serum samples for one hour at RT. All
sera were identical to those used on the human protein
microarrays. The dot blots were then reacted with anti-human
IgG (H+L) HRP conjugate antibody (Cat. No. 31410, Thermo Fisher
Scientific Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, USA) for one hour at RT, incubated
with ECL reagent (Cat. No. 34096, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.,
Pittsburgh, PA) for one minute, and then exposed to autoradiog￾raphy film.
Western Blot Analysis
Western blot analysis was performed to determine the number,
diversity, stability over time and targets of serum autoantibodies
using methods previously described [21]. Fresh frozen rat brain,
pig brain, and frozen human brain tissue were lysed using RIPA
buffer (150 mM sodium chloride, 1.0% Triton) or 2% Triton X￾100 buffer. Normal human liver, lung, and kidney tissue lysates
were purchased from PROTEIN Inc. (Cat. No. HN-13, HN-15,
HN-11, Romona, CA). All sera were diluted 1:500 and used as
primary antibodies individually. Secondary antibodies were HRP￾conjugated anti-human IgG (H+L) (Cat. No. 31410, Thermo Fisher
Scientific Inc., Pittsburgh, PA), anti-rat IgG and anti-pig IgG (Cat.
No. STAR21B and AAI41P, AbD SeroTec, Oxford, UK). Western
blots were then developed using ECL reagent and autoradiogra￾phy film. Approval for the use of all animal samples in this study
was obtained from the UMDNJ-Stratford Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee.
Results
IgG Autoantibodies are Abundant and Ubiquitous in
Human Sera
To detect and determine the relative abundance of autoanti￾bodies in the blood, we probed human protein microarrays with
individual human sera from the following subject groups: normal
healthy controls (n = 57), Alzheimer’s disease patients (n = 36),
Parkinson’s disease patients (n = 48), multiple sclerosis patients
(n = 7), and breast cancer patients (n = 18) for a total of 166 human
serum samples. Each microarray contained 9,486 native human
proteins bound to a nitrocellulose substratum as potential targets
for serum IgG (Fig. 1). A Z-factor score of $ 0.4 in the resulting
relative immunofluorescence indicated a mean of 1,996.9 different
IgG-bound antigens per individual; although with significant
individual variation (n = 166, 1,996.9 6 1,051.9). The specific
antigens and the relative abundance of their corresponding
autoantibodies are shown in Figure 2 as well as in Table S1. To
further focus on the common and abundant autoantibodies across
the population, we set the analytical criteria as follows: (1) Z factor
$ 0.4; (2) RFU . 5000; and (3) consistently positive in over 60%
of subjects in each group, including control and diseased groups.
Interestingly, using these criteria, we found 66 autoantibodies that
are common and abundant in the population, regardless of age,
gender and disease status (Table S1). These autoantibody targets
are involved in various biological functions including metabolism,
signal transduction and structural proteins. No individual tested
had less than 301 distinct serum autoantibodies detectable using
these criteria: most had thousands.
To verify the reactivity of autoantibodies detected with human
protein microarrays, we carried out dot-blot analyses using
commercially-obtained purified, native proteins. We selected the
antigens of two commonly detected autoantibodies, pentatrico￾peptide repeat-containing protein 2 (PTCD2) and intercellular
adhesion molecule 4 (ICAM4), and sought to confirm autoanti￾body reactivity. Each protein was spotted onto a nitrocellulose
membrane in equal amounts and then probed with sera identical
to that used to probe the microarrays (Fig. 3). Results show
reactivity and proportionately diminished reactions with serial
dilutions, thus providing additional biochemical confirmation that
the autoantibodies detected in human sera are present and
reactive to their antigens.
Age, Gender, and the Presence of Specific Diseases
Strongly Influence the Number of Autoantibodies
Detected Using Protein Microarrays
In an effort to represent the broadest possible population, the
serum samples used to probe human protein microarrays included
subjects of each gender from a variety of ages and health
backgrounds. Data showing the effects of these variables on the
total number of IgG autoantibodies detectable using human
protein microarrays are presented in Tables 1 and 2.
To investigate the influence of age on the average number of
serum autoantibodies detected, healthy control samples of each
gender were categorized into three groups: ,45 years, 45–65
years, and .65 years (Table 1). Results revealed that increasing
age was accompanied by a corresponding increase in the total
number of detectable autoantibodies. The .65 year old group had
the highest number of detectable autoantibodies (2647.8 6
1139.2, n = 15); the 45–65 years group had the next highest
number of serum autoantibodies (2335.6 6 1009.5, n = 32); and
the youngest age group, ,45 years, had the fewest autoantibodies
(1498.2 6 545.7, n = 10). The lesser number of autoantibodies in
the ,45 years group was statistically significant when compared to
both the 45–65 years group (p = 0.0021) and the .65 years group
(p = 0.0028). Taken together, this indicates that there is a
somewhat linear progression of increasing serum autoantibody
diversity with increasing age.
When examined on the basis of gender, healthy age-matched
samples from males and females exhibited a striking difference in
the average number of serum autoantibodies (Table 1). Females
were found to have a substantially greater number of autoanti￾bodies (2772.5 6 714.8, n = 18) than males of equivalent age and
health status (2039.3 6 1092.7, n = 39). This difference was
statistically significant (p = 0.004) and may, at least in part, account
for the increased prevalence of autoimmune diseases in women
[22].
The presence of specific diseases also strongly influenced the
number of detectable autoantibodies in the serum. Data for each
disease subgroup examined compared to gender- and age￾matched controls are shown in Table 2. Alzheimer’s and
Parkinson’s disease patients demonstrated a statistically significant
reduction in the number of autoantibodies compared to healthy
controls (p = 6.061025 and p = 0.023, respectively). Each, on
average, had several hundred fewer autoantibody-bound antigens
represented on protein microarrays than their healthy counter￾parts. Multiple sclerosis patients had a significant reduction in the
average number of autoantibodies as well (p = 0.044). Lastly, while
breast cancer patients had fewer detectable autoantibodies than
their matched controls, the difference was not significant
(p = 0.71).

Serum Autoantibodies are Reactive to Proteins Expressed
in Many Human Tissues
As described above, human protein microarrays revealed that
human serum contains IgG autoantibodies directed against
thousands of distinct protein antigens. These proteins are
expressed throughout the body and are involved in many critical
processes. We next sought to confirm that the autoantibodies
detected are reactive to antigens in diverse human tissues and
organs using western analysis (Fig. 4). To investigate the reactivity
of serum autoantibodies to tissue-specific epitopes, proteins from
human liver, kidney, lung, and brain tissue lysates were separated
by SDS-PAGE and probed with individual human serum samples
as primary antibody (Fig. 4A). All sera tested were found to possess
autoantibodies that were immunoreactive to multiple proteins
from each of the organs. Not surprisingly, many autoantibodies
bound to common antigens shared by each organ as well.
Autoantibodies are Abundant in the Blood of All
Mammalian Species Tested
To investigate whether autoantibodies with affinity to diverse
self-antigens are also abundant and ubiquitous in the sera of other
mammals, we separated proteins from rat and pig brain lysates via
SDS-PAGE and probed them with their respective sera as primary
antibodies (Fig. 5A). Both rat and pig serum were also found to
possess numerous autoantibodies that were self-reactive to their
own brain antigens. Interestingly, in western blots, human sera
demonstrated comparatively less immunoreactivity to human
brain antigens than did the corresponding blots using rat and
pig lysates and sera. This reduction is most likely due to
unavoidable post-mortem protein degradation which can be
avoided in the animal models. The intensity and comparable
number of immunopositive reactions on western blots using rat
and pig serum lead us to conclude that, like humans, both animals
have abundant serum IgG autoantibodies and that perhaps
complex serum IgG autoantibody profiles are a conserved feature
among mammals.
Individual Autoantibody Profiles Remain Consistent Over
Time
We next sought to investigate the stability of individual
autoantibody profiles over time. To address this, proteins from
human brain tissue lysate were separated by gel electrophoresis
and probed with human serum obtained from individuals at
several time points over a period of years (Fig. 4B). Similarly, the
stability of autoantibody profiles over time was also tested in pigs
over a period of three months (Fig. 5B). The first human subject
(HS-I) was a fifty-two year old male followed over a period of four
years. The second (HS-II) was a sixty-two year old female with
Parkinson’s disease followed for two years. As shown in Figure 4B,
although there are slight variations in individual band intensity
from one blood withdrawal date to the next, the overall
autoantibody reactivity pattern, reflecting the presence of specific
autoantibodies, remained remarkably stable over the entire period.
These findings lead us to conclude that individual IgG autoan￾tibody profiles in the blood are stable over long periods of time,
which is consistent with the earlier findings of Lacroix-Desmazes et
al. [23].
Discussion
Originally thought to bind exclusively to foreign antigens, we
now understand that there is a spectrum of auto-reactivity in
serum antibodies: from the innately produced, poly-reactive IgMs
that function to clear the tissues of post-apoptotic debris, to the
pathological IgGs that are associated with autoimmune diseases.
The former represent ‘‘natural’’ antibodies produced by a unique
population of B-1 cells from birth in an apparent default pattern

without the need for antigen presentation [1–4]. IgG autoanti￾bodies, however, are generally thought to represent a failure in B
cell self-tolerance mechanisms or an extremity of somatic
hypermutation, and are generally not considered a purposeful
product of the healthy immune system [24]. Despite this, it has
been suggested that IgG autoantibodies are both abundant and
ubiquitous in human sera, and that some may be present in the
absence of disease and may arise from an exaggerated immune
response against self as seen in autoimmune diseases [7,18]. Here,
we demonstrate that all human sera possess extremely complex
profile of IgG autoantibodies directed against thousands of discrete
human protein antigens. This level of complexity alone suggests
that IgG autoantibodies carry out some important, but as yet
unrecognized, function.
IgG Autoantibody Abundance
An accurate estimate of the total number of autoantibodies in
human serum at any one time is a difficult undertaking. The
development of multiplex platforms containing a large number of
human protein antigens such as protein microarrays, multiplex
ELISA, and luminex beads now make this task possible. We chose
human protein microarrays because they currently contain the
largest number of antigens in a native conformation: 9,486 distinct
human antigens. Using a standard Z-factor cutoff of $ 0.4,
relative immunofluorescence values indicated that most individu￾als have thousands of circulating serum IgG autoantibodies
(Tables 1, 2). Considering that the 9,486 proteins on the
microarray represent only a fraction of the estimated size of the
entire human proteome, it is logical to assume that there are
actually far more autoantibodies present in serum than detected
here, perhaps numbering in the many thousands. Furthermore,
this analysis considered autoantibody diversity only from the
perspective of unique antigens bound: the polyclonal nature of
human antibodies makes a more precise estimate of distinct
idiotypes difficult. However, these and other technical limitations
would all tend to reduce the total number of detectable
autoantibodies. Given the strong evidence supporting an abun￾dance of autoantibodies in all human sera, it is probable that there

General transcription factor II-I and SERPINE1 mRNA binding protein 1 (SERBP1)] were chosen due to their high prevalence in . 60% of the healthy
population. The clear lamination of signal intensities shown by each autoantibody-antigen reaction suggests comparable levels of these
autoantibodies in the blood across the population

are many more naturally occurring autoantibodies than detected
even here: all with cognate antigens representing a tremendous
variety of human proteins.
The Influence of Age, Gender, and Disease on IgG
Autoantibody Diversity
Previous studies using quantitative immunoblotting have shown
that the self-reactive IgM autoantibody repertoire differentiates
during the first years of life and remains relatively constant
thereafter [25]. There is evidence that this combinatorial immune
recognition repertoire is present in all mammals and that its origin
may date back to an early point in the evolution of jawed
vertebrates as a rapid genetic process that is independent of
antigenic selection [26]. Here, we show that while all humans also
have a great number of serum IgG autoantibodies, this number
can vary considerably between individuals. We have investigated
the influence of three factors, age, gender and disease, on the
number of detectable autoantibodies using protein microarrays.
Surprisingly, the number of IgG autoantibodies present in the
serum increases almost linearly with age (Table 1). This is a
significant observation: it contrasts directly with serum diversity of
Figure 3. Dot blot confirmation of serum IgG auto-reactivity.
Two identified antigens of serum autoantibodies, PTCD2 and ICAM4,
were spotted onto nitrocellulose and probed with serum identical to
that used on the protein microarrays. Serial dilution with diminishing
immunoreactivity confirmed the presence and activity of IgG autoan￾tibodies in human sera.

individual (HS-II) over a period of two years. Consistent patterns of serum IgG immunoreactivity were specific to individuals and appeared to remain
stable over time.

populations, is thought to gradually diminish with age [27].
Gender was also found to be an important variable. Females have
a much higher average number of autoantibodies than males
(p = 0.004) (Table 1). This finding is relevant in light of the fact
that females suffer from autoimmune misregulation at much
higher rates than men [22]. Lastly, disease itself seems to exert an
effect on the number of autoantibodies in serum. Alzheimer’s
disease, Parkinson’s disease, and multiple sclerosis patients all had
a statistically significant decrease in the number of autoantibodies
when compared to age- and gender-matched controls (Table 2).
Even breast cancer patients had a measurable decrease, although
it was less significant. The diminished autoantibody counts among
the Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease subgroups were particu￾larly striking, given that those patients were older and thus would
have otherwise fallen into the demographic group with the highest
number of autoantibodies. Further research is needed for nuanced
understanding of the influence of age, gender, and health-status in
autoimmunity.
Autoantibody Abundance: A Physiological Necessity?
Here, we show that all human sera possess thousands of IgG
autoantibodies regardless of age, gender, or the presence of
disease. We have also confirmed that complex profiles of auto￾reactive IgGs are consistent in individuals over long time periods
as shown previously by Lacroix-Desmazes et al. [23] and Mirilas et
al. [28] and are conserved in other mammalian species. Further
research is needed to understand exactly how these autoantibodies
are produced and sustained. It is probable that some of them
might have an infectious origin; being rendered self-reactive
through the vagaries of somatic hypermutation. But, given the vast
metabolic expense of maintaining the clonal B cell populations
necessary to support such a stable and complex profile of
thousands of autoantibodies, it is unlikely that all of these
autoantibodies represent a pathological breakdown in central
tolerance. Rather, we suggest that this diversity and consistency
indicate that IgG autoantibodies are necessary and perform some
key physiological function.
The supposition that autoantibodies may actually perform some
beneficial function is not without precedent. As mentioned above,
the debris-clearing activity of IgM autoantibodies has been well
established, and mice experimentally deprived of these autoanti￾bodies demonstrate lupus-like symptoms [29,30]. Even auto￾reactive IgGs have received some attention in this regard [7].
Vargas and colleagues have already demonstrated the importance
self-reactive IgG antibodies in the central nervous system. Anti￾myelin IgG autoantibodies assist in debris-clearance after periph￾eral nerve injury, and, in their absence, axonal regeneration is
impeded [31]. Another study on the plasma IgG and IgM levels in
children with autism spectrum disorders seems to indicate that
immunoglobulins are involved in the development of a healthy
brain. Children with autism have significantly reduced levels IgG
and IgM, and this reduction correlates with the severity of
behavioral deficit [32]. This evidence, combined with the vast
numbers of IgG autoantibodies measured in even healthy human
serum blurs what was once thought to be a linear relationship
between auto-reactive IgG and autoimmunity. There does seem to
be a role for IgG autoantibodies in the healthy immune system.
IgG Autoantibodies May Represent an Adaptive
Response to Injury and Disease
It is important to differentiate the potential homeostatic
functions of auto-reactive IgG from those of natural IgM.
Considering the complexity of follicular B-2 cell activation, and
the adaptive nature of the antibody response, IgG autoantibodies
would be perfectly suited to clear the debris from situation-specific
events like disease or trauma. On the other hand, the limited, pre￾programmed panel of innate natural IgM would be incapable of
this kind of tailored response.
Avrameas and coworkers have suggested that the recognition of
self-constituents by the immune system may play a role in body
homeostasis [6,7]. In accord with this concept, we extend this
hypothesis by proposing that IgG autoantibodies function as an
adaptive mechanism to clear intercellular debris, thus implying
that disease-induced tissue damage leads to increased production
of autoantibodies appropriate to the clean-up of that debris. Thus,
under conditions of ongoing pathology, autoantibodies that target
the unique pathology-specific debris should show selective and
measureable titer increases in the blood [33–35]. In agreement
with this concept, the results of our previous studies have
demonstrated that it is possible to identify and make use of
disease-induced changes in autoantibody profiles as diagnostic
biomarkers of disease. For example, we have recently shown that
separate panels of autoantibody biomarkers can be used to
successfully and accurately identify and diagnose Alzheimer’s and
Parkinson’s disease patients from controls with high degrees of
sensitivity and specificity [19,20]. We propose that, in these
diagnostics, we are measuring specific changes in autoantibody
profiles that are associated with the autoantibody response to the
very specific damage induced by these particular pathologies.
Since many diseases exhibit cell- and tissue-specific damage, we
predict that the identification of characteristic disease-induced
changes to autoantibody profiles can be used as successful
diagnostics for a wide variety of diseases.
Conclusion
IgG autoantibodies are abundant and ubiquitous in the serum
of all humans. Further evidence indicates that this complex profile
of autoantibodies is present in other mammals and consistent in
individuals over time. We suggest that the scale and universality of
autoantibody proliferation in all sera is a telltale sign of its necessity
– perhaps as an adaptive debris-clearance mechanism. Moreover,
we propose that disease-induced perturbations in individual
autoantibody profiles present an opportunity to accurately detect
and successfully diagnose disease, as we have already demonstrat￾ed with Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. Lastly, we suggest
that the widespread presence of these naturally occurring, non￾pathological IgG autoantibodies presents a new frontier in
immunological research. It prompts future exploration of the
potential of these autoantibodies as a new class of biomarkers for
diagnostics and therapeutics.
