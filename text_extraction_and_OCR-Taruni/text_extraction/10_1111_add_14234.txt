Abstract
Aims: Alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drug use are key contributors to the global burden of 
disease. This aim of this review was to provide an up-to-date curated source of information 
on use and associated mortality and burden of disease. Limitations in the data are also 
discussed, including how these can be addressed in the future. 
Methods: Online data sources were identified through expert review. Data were mainly 
obtained from the World Health Organization, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, 
and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.
Results: In 2015, the estimated prevalence among the adult population was 18.3% for heavy 
episodic alcohol use (in the past 30 days); 15.2% for daily tobacco smoking; and 3.8%, 
0.77%, 0.37%, and 0.35% for past-year cannabis, amphetamine, opioid, and cocaine use, 
respectively. European regions had the highest prevalence of heavy episodic alcohol use and 
daily tobacco use. The age-standardised prevalence of alcohol dependence was 843.2 per 
100,000 people; for cannabis, opioids, amphetamines and cocaine dependence it was 259.3, 
220.4, 86.0 and 52.5 per 100,000 people, respectively. High-Income North America region 
had among the highest rates of cannabis, opioid, and cocaine dependence. Attributable 
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were highest for tobacco (170.9 million DALYs), 
followed by alcohol (85.0 million) and illicit drugs (27.8 million). Substance-attributable 
mortality rates were highest for tobacco (110.7 deaths per 100,000 people), followed by 
alcohol and illicit drugs (33.0, and 6.9 deaths per 100,000 people, respectively). Attributable 
age-standardised mortality rates and DALYs for alcohol and illicit drugs were highest in 
Eastern Europe; attributable age-standardised tobacco mortality rates and DALYs were 
highest in Oceania.
Conclusions: In 2015 alcohol and tobacco between them cost the human population more 
than a quarter of a billion disability-adjusted life years, with illicit drugs costing a further tens

of millions. Europeans proportionately suffered more but in absolute terms the mortality rate
was greatest in low and middle income countries with large populations and where the quality 
of data was more limited. Better standardised and rigorous methods for data collection, 
collation and reporting are needed to accurately assess geographical and temporal trends in 
substance use and burden.

Introduction
Alcohol, tobacco and illicit drug use are major global risk factors for disability and premature 
loss of life (1). Their health burden is accompanied by significant economic costs, namely 
expenditure on healthcare and law enforcement, lost productivity, and other direct and 
indirect costs, including harm to others (2). Estimating the prevalence of use and associated 
burden of disease and mortality at the country, regional, and global level is critical in 
quantifying the extent and severity of the burden arising from substance use. This knowledge 
should inform allocation decisions by governments, policy-makers, and funding bodies about 
service provision and policy and assist in evaluations of the impact of policies (3). These 
estimates must be rigorously developed, regularly updated, and geographically 
comprehensive to quantify and detect change in indicators over time. 
There are various research groups that regularly compile estimates of the global prevalence of 
substance use, dependence, and related disability and mortality. It is useful to collate these 
collections to provide an overall global picture of the distribution of substance use and 
associated mortality and burden of disease and to highlight key gaps in evidence. Indeed, 
these data are critical to monitoring progress towards Sustainable Development Goals (4), 
particularly those requiring quantification of the prevalence of substance use and dependence 
to calculate appropriate treatment and intervention coverage. This review is part of an going 
series (5), which has two purposes, to: i) curate recent estimates of the prevalence of use, 
dependence, mortality and burden of disease associated with alcohol, tobacco and illicit drugs 
at the country, regional, and global level, and ii) comment on the availability and quality of 
existing data collections, and identify challenges in estimating and comparing substance use 
and related burden geographically and temporally. For the purpose of this review, illicit drug 
use was defined as use of a substance where consumption has been prohibited by

international drug control treaties except for medical purposes (3). For illicit drugs, we
focused on use of cannabis (noting that policy regarding cannabis use and supply varies in 
some countries, e.g., USA, Netherlands; 6), methamphetamine, cocaine, as well as extra￾medical opioid use (i.e., use that is without a prescription or not as directed by a doctor; 7).
We also briefly considered estimates related to use of new psychoactive substances (NPS; see 
Box 1 for details about NPS).

Methods
Design
We identified online data sources on alcohol, tobacco and illicit drug use, dependence, and 
attributable burden of disease and mortality through web searches and email consultations
with experts in the epidemiology of substance use. This review focused on data collections at 
the global level which also disaggregate estimates at the country and/or regional level. These 
collections are mainly held by the following organisations: World Health Organization 
(WHO); United Nations Office on Crime and Drugs (UNODC); and the Institute for Health 
Metrics and Evaluation’s (IHME) Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2015. Details of 
data collections and reporting by these organisations (including links to downloadable data) 
are provided in Table 1, and regional classifications of countries for each organisation are 
provided in Appendix A. The below section overviews the indicators of interest, and data 
sources used, for the present paper. It should be noted that these organisations use different 
approaches for identifying source data and modelling estimates, and thus comparison of 
estimates from different organisations may not be valid (see Discussion for further details).
*Table 1 approximately here*
Prevalence of substance use
Indicators of interest comprised the annual prevalence of alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drug use 
(including NPS and injecting drug use) amongst the adult population in 2015. Estimates of 
the prevalence of alcohol use for 2015 for the adult population (aged ≥15 years) by region 
and globally were obtained from the WHO Collaborating Centre for Addiction and Mental 
Health (CAMH) for validation and later inclusion into the Global Status Report on Alcohol 
and Health 2018 and the Global information System on Alcohol and Health (8).

Global Substance Use: 2017 Update

Global and regional estimates of the age-standardised prevalence of daily tobacco smoking in 
the adult population were obtained from the GBD study 2015 (9). This indicator
underestimates total prevalence in countries such as the US where non-daily smoking is 
relatively common but still represents substantial use. Figures on non-daily smoking were not 
available for many countries. This indicator also does not include non-smoked forms of 
tobacco (which is common in many parts of the world). Global and regional estimates of the
annual prevalence of illicit drug use and NPS use amongst the adult population (age 15-64 
years) in 2015 were obtained from the UNODC World Drug Report 2017 (10), with reference 
to European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs 2015 report (11). Estimates 
of the prevalence of injecting drug use for 2015 in the adult population (age 15-64 years)
were obtained from the UNODC World Drug Report 2017 (10), the GBD study 2015 (9) and 
from a recent multi-stage systematic review of peer-reviewed and grey literature on the 
global epidemiology of injecting drug use (12). 
Prevalence of substance dependence
Indicators of interest comprised the prevalence of past year alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drug 
dependence amongst the adult population in 2015. Modelled estimates of global and regional 
all-age number and age-standardised rate (per 100,000 people) of past year dependence on 
alcohol, amphetamine, cannabis, cocaine, and opioids were obtained from the GBD study
2015 by region (9). Estimates of smoked tobacco dependence are not modelled in the GBD
study. Daily smokers have very low probability of successful quitting in any given attempt
(13) and so daily smoking was considered indicative of a significant level of dependence in 
the current study. Substance dependence was defined according to the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV edition (14) and the International Classification of 

Global Substance Use: 2017 Update

Diseases 9
th
or 10th edition (15). We used this rather than ‘substance use disorder’ as defined 
in DSM 5
th edition because that is the most commonly available indicator globally.
All-cause substance-attributable mortality 
Estimates of smoked tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drug all-cause attributable mortality from all 
disease and injuries were obtained from the GBD study 2015 (9). The regional and global 
number of all-age attributable deaths and age-standardised death rate (per 100,000) are 
presented. 
Substance-attributable burden of disease
Disease burden caused by alcohol use, tobacco smoking, and illicit drug use as risk factors 
are presented. Burden of disease was presented for substance use attributable disability￾adjusted life years (DALYs) which are the sum of years of life lost (YLLs) to premature 
mortality and years of life lived with disability (YLDs). Modelled estimates of global and 
regional attributable DALYs (all-ages) and age-standardised (per 100,000 people) attributable 
DALYs for alcohol, smoked tobacco, and illicit drugs for the adult population were obtained
from the GBD study 2015 (9). We also obtained estimates of the serological prevalence of 
HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody among the adult population (age 15-64 years) who 
inject drugs from the UNODC World Drug Report 2017 (10) and from a recent multi-stage 
systematic review of peer-reviewed and grey literature on the global epidemiology of 
injecting drug use (12).
Analyses
Modelled estimates are presented as obtained from source documents. Uncertainty intervals 
(UI) are presented where available to indicate the uncertainty range around the estimate; the

way in which these intervals were generated differs across data collections (see details in 
Table notes).

Results
Substance use
Globally, CAMH (8) estimated that 6.42 litres of pure alcohol per capita were consumed by 
the adult population (aged ≥15 years) in 2015 (Table 2). Approximately one-fifth (18.3%) of 
the adult population (or two-fifths (40.3%) of all adult alcohol consumers) reported heavy 
episodic drinking (≥60g alcohol on one occasion) in the past 30 days (Table 2; Figure 1a). 
Central, Eastern, and Western Europe recorded consistently higher alcohol consumption per 
capita (11.61, 11.98 and 11.09 litres, respectively) and a higher percentage of heavy 
consumption amongst consumers (50.5%, 48.2%, and 40.2%, respectively). North Africa and 
the Middle East recorded the lowest alcohol consumption per capita (0.91 litres pure alcohol) 
and the lowest percentage of alcohol consumers who reported heavy drinking (17.3%). 
Central Sub-Saharan Africa showed unique findings, with the highest proportion of heavy 
consumption (79.7%) despite a relatively low per capita consumption (4.72 litres).
The GBD study 2015 (9) estimated that the same European regions also recorded the highest 
age-standardised prevalence of daily tobacco smoking (Eastern Europe 24.2% [22.7, 25.7], 
Central Europe 23.7% [22.6, 24.8], and Western Europe 20.9% [20.2, 21.7]), with the lowest 
prevalence recorded in Western Sub-Saharan Africa (4.7% [4.3, 5.1]). The European regions 
and Southeast Asia had a smoking prevalence that was significantly higher than the global 
prevalence (Table 2; Figure 1b). Globally, the age-standardised prevalence of daily smoking 
was 15.2% (14.7, 15.7). Across all ages globally, there were 933.1 (901.5, 966.5) million 
people who smoked tobacco daily. China (268.3 million [263.3, 273.5]), India (104.2 million
[99.2, 109.6]), and Indonesia (53.7 million [49.6, 58.3]) had the largest number of smokers
that together accounted for 45.7% of daily smokers globally. 

Global Substance Use: 2017 Update

*Table 2 and Figure 1 approximately here*
Global estimated annual prevalence of illicit drug use as reported in the UNODC World Drug 
Report 2017 (10) was highest for cannabis (3.8% [2.7, 4.9] of adults aged 15-64 years old), 
followed by amphetamines (0.77% [0.30, 1.24]), opioids (including prescription opioids and 
opiates; 0.37% [0.27, 0.49]), and cocaine (0.35% [0.27, 0.46]; Table 3). There was 
substantial subregional variation in prevalence, particularly for cannabis use (1.8% [1.0, 3.0] 
in Asia to 10.3% in Oceania [8.7, 14.7]). The UNODC World Drug Report 2017 (10) also 
collates estimates of NPS use. Fewer than 1% of sampled populations (typically household 
surveys or surveys of school students) reported use of specific NPS in the past year (see Box
1 for discussion of limitations and future directions of monitoring NPS use).
*Table 3 and Box 1 approximately here*
In the UNODC World Drug Report 2017 (10) it was estimated that 0.25% (0.18, 0.36) of the 
adult population aged 15-64 years reported injecting drug use in 2015, equating to 11.8 
million (8.6, 17.4) people (Table 3). In contrast, a recent global systematic review (12)
estimated that 0.33% (0.21, 0.49) of the adult population reported injecting drug use in the 
past year in 2015. This equates to 15.6 million (10.2, 23.7) people (Figure 2). 
*Figure 2 approximately here*
Substance dependence
Globally, alcohol dependence was the most prevalent substance of dependence (Table 4), 
with 63.5 million (57.5, 69.9) estimated cases in 2015: an age-standardised rate of 843.2 

Global Substance Use: 2017 Update
13
(763.7, 927.3) per 100,000 people. Cannabis and opioids dependence were the most common 
types of illicit drug dependence, with 19.8 (18.0, 21.8) and 16.7 (14.7, 19.1) million cases in 
2015 (age-standardised rates of 259.3 [235.7, 285.5] and 220.4 [193.1, 251.0] per 100,000 
population), respectively. Amphetamine and cocaine dependence were less prevalent, with 
6.6 million (5.3, 8.0) and 3.9 million (3.4, 4.3) cases globally in 2015 (corresponding to age￾standardised rates of 86.0 [69.2, 104.6] and 52.5 [46.6, 58.7] persons per 100,000 
population), respectively. 
*Table 3 approximately here*
The high prevalence of different types of substance dependence in some regions reflected 
their higher prevalence of substance use. For example, the High-Income North America
region (the US and Canada) had one of the most prevalent rates of cannabis, opioid, and 
cocaine dependence (748.7 [694.8, 812.3], 650.0 [574.5, 727.3], and 301.2 [269.3, 333.7] per 
100,000 people, respectively). Australasia (Australia and New Zealand) had the highest 
prevalence of age-standardised rates of amphetamine dependence (491.5 per 100,000 people
[441.4, 545.5]), as well as high rates of cannabis, opioid and cocaine use dependence (693.7
[648.1, 744.4], 509.9 [453.7, 577.8], and 160.5 [136.4, 187.1] per 100,000 people, 
respectively). Age-standardised prevalence of amphetamine, cannabis, cocaine and opioid 
dependence were largely lowest in Central Sub-Saharan Africa, Eastern Sub-Saharan Africa, 
and Western Sub-Saharan Africa. The most marked regional variation was in alcohol 
dependence: the highest age-standardised rate was in Eastern Europe (2786.7 [2487.3, 
3109.6] per 100,000 people) and the lowest in North Africa and the Middle East (274.2 
[241.7, 309.3] per 100,000 people).

Global Substance Use: 2017 Update

Substance use attributable mortality and burden of disease
Globally, the highest age-standardised rates of mortality were for smoked tobacco as a risk 
factor at 110.7 (101.0, 120.3) per 100,000 deaths, compared to 33.0 (28.0, 37.7), and 6.9 
deaths 6.9 (6.1, 7.6) per 100,000 people in 2015 for alcohol and illicit drugs, respectively
(Table 5; Appendix B). Alcohol and illicit drug attributable age-standardised mortality rates 
were highest in Eastern Europe (108.0 [63.5, 152.4] and 23.7 [21.0, 25.9] deaths per 100,000
deaths, respectively). Tobacco attributable mortality rates were highest in Oceania (which 
includes e.g. Papua New Guinea, Kiribati, Federated States of Micronesia, Solomon Islands; 
269.3 [184.4, 382.9] deaths per 100,000 deaths). 
Variations in burden of disease estimates by types of substance as risk factors largely 
reflected those for mortality. Absolute burden was highest for tobacco, with 170.9 million
(156.2, 186.0) tobacco-attributable DALYs (see Appendix B for smoking and second-hand 
smoking attributable DALYs). This was followed by 85 million (77.2, 93.0) alcohol 
attributable DALYs and 27.8 million (24.4, 31.2) illicit drug attributable DALYs 2015
(Table 4; Figure 3). Estimates of alcohol and illicit drug attributable burden rates were 
highest in Eastern Europe (4,033.5 [3259.9, 4795.1] and 1,386.5 [1229.6, 1535.4] age￾standardised DALYs per 100,000 population, respectively). Tobacco-attributable burden 
rates was highest in Oceania (7,149.7 [4888.1, 10491.5] age-standardised DALYs per 
100,000 population). 
*Table 4 and Figure 3 approximately here*
Alcohol-attributable burden was primarily due to cirrhosis (17.0 million DALYs [15.6, 18.3]
all ages), transport injuries (16.8 million DALYs [14.9, 18.9]), and cancers (12.1 million

Global Substance Use: 2017 Update
15
DALYs, [11.1, 12.9]) (9). Illicit drug attributable burden was concentrated in drug use 
disorders (16.9 million [14.0, 19.9], of which 12.9 [9.9, 14.1] were opioid use disorders￾attributable), cirrhosis (4.7 million [3.8, 5.5]), HIV infection (3.0 million [2.6, 3.6]), and liver 
cancer (1.8 million [1.4, 2.1]) (9).
A recent global systematic review (12) estimated that there are 8.2 million (4.7-12.4) people 
who inject drugs who are HCV antibody positive, and that 2.8 million (1.5-4.5) people who 
inject drugs are living with HIV. This is equivalent to 52.3% (42.4-62.1%) and 17.8% (10.8-
24.8%) of people who inject drugs globally, respectively. The UNODC World Drug Report 
(10) also included estimates of HCV amongst people who inject drugs (51.7%, equating to 
6.1 million people, no uncertainty interval available) and of HIV among people who inject 
drugs (13.1%, equating to 1.6 million [0.9-3.2]).
Discussion
Main findings
Alcohol use and tobacco smoking are far more prevalent than illicit substance use, globally 
and in most regions. Global estimates suggest that one in five adults report at least one 
occasion of heavy episodic alcohol use in the past month, increasing their risk of acute harm
(e.g., injury; 8). Nearly one in seven adults (15.2%) were estimated to engage in daily 
tobacco smoking, increasing their risk of 12 types of cancer, non-malignant respiratory 
diseases, cardiovascular disease and a wide array of other chronic health conditions (16). In 
contrast, use of illicit drugs was far less common. Fewer than one in twenty people were 
estimated to use cannabis in the past year, and much lower estimates were observed for
amphetamines, opioids and cocaine.

Global Substance Use: 2017 Update
16
The majority of the health burden from substance use was attributable to tobacco smoking 
(the most prevalent substance) and the smallest attributable to use of illicit drugs. There was 
substantial geographic variation in these estimates and several caveats (discussed below)
need to be borne in mind when interpreting these data. 
Data availability
Certain countries and regions (e.g., Africa, Caribbean and Latin America, Asia regions) have 
limited or no data on substance use and associated health burden. These are typically low or 
middle income countries that frequently have punitive drug policies, and may experience 
serious political and social unrest. These countries often warrant enhanced monitoring 
because they are at risk of rapid escalation in substance use and related health burden. For 
example, a recent review found evidence of injecting drug use in 23 countries in Sub-Saharan 
Africa where it had not been previously documented (12). Yet only 7 of the 37 countries that 
had evidence of injecting drug use in the Sub-Saharan Africa region offered needle-syringe 
programmes, and only eight offered medication assisted treatment for opioid dependence. 
The coverage of interventions, where they were offered, was very low (17). These countries 
face the risk of a rapid escalation in HIV infection among people who inject drugs. 
In countries where no data have been collected, an alternative is to impute prevalence. 
Imputed prevalence can be based on prevalence in neighbouring countries and country-level 
predictors. The GBD study uses Disease Modeling – Metaregression (DisMod; 18) to fill in 
gaps where data are incomplete to produce prevalence and disease burden estimates for each 
disease cause, age group, sex, country, and year. There are, however, substantial uncertainties 
in these modelled estimates. This can be reduced only as better epidemiological evidence 
becomes available. 

Global Substance Use: 2017 Update
17
Data quality and estimation
The quality of estimates is often poor when data are available. For example, there is greater 
geographic coverage in estimates of alcohol use because consumption can be better 
monitored via surveys (19), and taxation, production, import and export data are available to 
produce estimates of consumption (20). However, unrecorded consumption, which is 
estimated to account for about 25% of all alcohol use globally, introduces marked 
measurement error (21). Similarly, prevalence of daily tobacco smoking obtained from the 
GBD study 2015 did not include non-daily smoking and abstinence among those who have 
ever smoked (see 22 for further details of estimation of prevalence of tobacco smoking in 
GBD), which varies considerably across countries (23). Indeed, a review of 16 countries 
showed a substantially lower rate of abstinence amongst people who formerly smoked 
tobacco daily in China, India, Egypt, Russia and Bangladesh (<20%) relative to similar 
indicators in UK, USA, Brazil and Uruguay (>35%) (23). Further, the estimates of prevalence 
of daily tobacco smoking did not include smokeless tobacco product use, as well as the use of 
e-cigarettes and heat-not-burn tobacco products. Given the emerging trends of non-cigarette 
products, it would be useful to have these modelled separately to monitor changes in 
prevalence over time for different types of tobacco products in the population. 
The need to measure progress towards various targets for improving global health has 
facilitated progress in standardising epidemiological indicators across studies (4, 24). 
Nonetheless, there is no gold-standard method for estimating how many people use or are 
dependent on alcohol, tobacco and illicit drugs, and no single method is ideal for all 
substances in all national contexts (Table 6). General population surveys rely on honest self￾report of substance use. Marginalised groups with high levels of problematic substance use 

Global Substance Use: 2017 Update
18
(e.g. prisoners, homeless people) or those living in countries where substance use is forbidden 
or stigmatised for religious or cultural reasons, are often excluded from such surveys. This 
leads to under-estimates of the prevalence of the most stigmatized and harmful forms of 
substance use in way that can vary geographically (3). Indirect methods of estimating 
prevalence for more stigmatised forms of substance use (e.g., multiplier, capture-recapture, 
network scale-up) may be biased by data limitations (e.g. dependencies between data sources 
in capture-recapture studies; 25). Even use of multiple indirect methods to estimate a single 
population size may not remedy biases in individual methods, as estimates may be 
inconsistent with each other, and simply averaging across estimates is not guaranteed to 
reduce bias (26). Multiparameter evidence synthesis addresses these limitations by 
triangulating all available evidence (including estimates of potential biases) but this approach
is complex and technically challenging to implement (27). 
*Table 6 approximately here*
Differences in estimates also occur across data collections. For example, we reported
estimates of global prevalence of injecting drug use from the UNODC World Drug Report 
2017 (0.25% [0.18, 0.36]; 10) and a recent systematic review of peer-review and grey 
literature (0.33% [0.21, 0.49]; 12). In this instance, data sources used within each country to 
model prevalence were mostly the same and the uncertainty intervals overlapped, suggesting 
that prevalence lies somewhere within this range. Yet, the various collections are based on
different search processes, criteria for source data inclusion, and modelling approaches to 
derive global estimates. For example, crude data included as input for analysis in the GBD
study 2015 were extracted from national data systems (e.g., vital statistics, disease registries, 
demographic surveillance systems), surveys (e.g., household surveys), clinical informatics 

Global Substance Use: 2017 Update
19
(e.g., disease notification data, health service encounter data such as hospital inpatient 
episodes), grey literature (e.g. government / country reports, EMCDDA), and scientific 
literature (e.g., peer-reviewed papers containing health-related data; 28). The GBD study
2015 used Disease Modeling – Metaregression (DisMod; 18) which checks internal 
consistency of existing estimates and fills in gaps where data are incomplete to produce 
prevalence and disease burden estimates (29). The GBD study 2015 also produced UIs which 
capture uncertainty from sample sizes of data sources, multiple modelling steps and from 
sources such as model estimation and model specification (30). In contrast, the United 
Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) (31) primarily derive data from the Annual 
Reports Questionnaire (ARQ) completed by Governments of Member States each calendar 
year. Estimates are computed using various adjustments, and imputation for countries where 
data are missing based on countries in the same subregion. Upper and lower uncertainty 
range estimates are calculated at a 90% confidence interval among those aged 15-64 years 
(see 31 for further details of methods). Yet, global estimates from these organisations cannot 
be combined to identify the ‘true’ prevalence. Instead we require the collection of high￾quality data and interrogation of estimation methods to maximise their consistency.
*Table 5 approximately here*
Quantifying burden of disease and mortality
There must be direct evidence that exposure to alcohol, tobacco or illicit drugs is (to some 
degree) linked to a health outcome before any such injury or disease is quantified within 
attributable burden (32). This is challenging because risk can vary according to substance 
type, frequency and quantity of use, route of administration, and concomitant use of 
substances. The quality of epidemiological data also varies across substances, with stronger 
evidence for the effects of alcohol and tobacco than for illicit drugs. The GBD study (9)

Global Substance Use: 2017 Update
20
represents one effort to regularly review, synthesise and evaluate the weight of evidence to 
support attribution (wholly or in part) to use of the specific substance (see Appendix C for 
disease conditions included in attributable burden quantification in 2015). 
There are a number of injury and disease categories where there is growing epidemiological 
evidence for causality (e.g. depression attributable to alcohol and illicit drugs; 33) and
biologically plausible attribution based on the pharmacodynamics of alcohol, tobacco, and 
illicit drugs. These factors suggest that we underestimate the true burden of alcohol, tobacco 
and especially illicit drug use. The degree of underestimation will be reduced by high quality 
studies on the acute and chronic causal effects of substances (e.g., emergency room studies, 
autopsy studies and, in particular, longitudinal cohort studies with record linkage to 
administrative health data) and comprehensive systematic reviews of these studies that assess
the relative risk for incidence of injuries and diseases.
There are also limitations in the mortality data modelled in the GBD study. Data on causes of 
death are dependent on the quality of death certificates, verbal autopsies, and the study’s 
method for code reassignment to likely cause of death when deaths are assigned codes that 
cannot be the underlying causes of death. For example, recent US research has shown 
corrected opioid-related mortality counts and rates 21-35% higher than original estimates 
from 1999-2015 when missing data on the specific opioid underlying drug poisoning deaths 
were imputed (34). Future research on the validity of code redistribution methods (e.g. for 
drug overdose deaths) and higher quality original data (including integrating verbal autopsies 
with vital statistics) will improve mortality estimates (35). Further details on the limitations 
on the cause of death modelling method in the Global Burden of Disease study are published 
elsewhere (36).

Global Substance Use: 2017 Update
21
It is important to acknowledge that estimates of burden quantify only the health consequences 
primarily for the consumer and largely omit effects on others (with some exceptions, e.g.,
effects of foetal alcohol exposure, second-hand smoking). They also do not quantify broader 
social and economic burdens imposed by substance use.
Measuring trends 
We did not investigate trends over time in substance use and related burden in this review, 
although trend analyses have been conducted in other publications (e.g., 37). The quality of 
trend data is considerably poorer for illicit drugs than for alcohol and tobacco consumption, 
where many countries have high quality epidemiological data on use and consumption data 
over many years. 
To validly assess change in substance use and burden we need national surveillance systems
that have been conducted regularly and consistently over time in their definition of indicators, 
data collection methods, sampling, and geographic coverage. Guidelines on epidemiological 
indicators (e.g., 23) and methods of measuring indicators (e.g., 38) will facilitate use of 
consistent approaches over time and between countries. The ability to implement regular 
studies are limited by the significant costs and resources needed to establish and regularly 
conduct surveillance studies, particularly population surveys. Improved data collection and 
estimation may mean that apparent temporal changes reflect variation in methods rather than 
‘true’ changes in the indicator of interest. 
One potentially useful new approach, particularly for illicit drug use, is to monitor levels of 
drug metabolites and residues in wastewater. Wastewater analyses can provide trends in total 

Global Substance Use: 2017 Update
22
population-level consumption of licit and illicit drugs, as indexed by a population-normalised 
load of drug residue within the catchment area of wastewater treatment plants (typically 
mg/1000 people/day; 39, 40). Direct inferences about changes in the number of people who 
use drugs or their patterns of use cannot be made using this data, but it may provide objective 
information that is not subject to underrepresentation of population groups or self-report bias
as with surveys. Wastewater analysis may help identify the full spectrum of pharmacological 
compounds consumed, including low prevalence drugs (e.g., NPS) and substances that are 
unknowingly consumed (e.g., mephedrone where sold as MDMA; 40). Further, wastewater 
can be regularly sampled and tested in near real-time. Various surveillance systems globally 
(40) now include wastewater data alongside survey results and indirect statistical methods to 
monitor spatiotemporal trends. 
Conclusions
Alcohol, tobacco and illicit substance use are important contributors to global burden of 
morbidity and mortality. Tobacco and alcohol are more commonly used and make larger 
contributions to disease burden that illicit drugs, but the latter’s burden is underestimated 
because of limitations on data availability and quality. Regular compilations of global data on 
geographic variations in prevalence of substance use and disease burden, such as this, may 
encourage the improvements in data and methods required to produce better future estimates.

appropriately weighted) to the corresponding survey question(s) who reported having consumed an alcoholic standard drink (10 grams) within the past 12 months on the same 
survey (or 1-abstainers)). f Lifetime and past 12 month abstainers are the proportion of adults (15+ years) in a given population who have not consumed any alcohol during 
their lifetime or past 12 months, respectively, assessed at a given point in time (computed from the total number of participants (15+ years) responding to the corresponding 
question in a given survey). Former drinkers is the proportion of adults (15+ years) in a given population who did not consume alcohol in the last 12 months, but who did 
previously do that, assessed at any given point in time (computed from the total number of participants (15+ years) responding to the corresponding question in a 
given survey). g Data on daily tobacco smoking were extracted from the GBD study 2015 (9). Age-standardised rates is the rate per 100,000 people, estimated using the GBD 
world population age standard. In the GBD study, 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) are derived from 1000 draws from the posterior distribution of each step in the estimation 
process. The UIs capture uncertainty from multiple modelling steps and from sources such as model estimation and model specification.

Note. Data in the table above were extracted from the ‘Maps and Tables’ of the UNODC World Drug Report 2017 (10), and estimates here were as reported by UNODC on
September 6, 2017. The annual prevalence rate is defined as the number of people who have consumed the drug at least once in the 12 months prior to the study, expressed as 
a percentage of the population aged 15-64, as provided by the United Nations Population Division for the year 2015. Estimates refer to unsanctioned use; that is where 
possession and/or supply is illegal or prescription medications are being used in an unsanctioned way. Estimates are derived from country-level annual report questionnaire 
data and other official sources. Subregional estimates are computed where prevalence estimates for at least two countries covering at least 20% of the population were 
available; - denotes that an estimate was not available. Uncertainty ranges were calculated using UNODC’s regional and global estimation methods, taking the 10th percentile 
of the lower bounds of the uncertainty ranges and the 90th percentile of the upper bounds of the uncertainty ranges, based on the 90% confidence intervals or best available 
estimates available for countries with data within the regions (see 31 for further details of calculation uncertainty ranges).

Box 1: Monitoring new psychoactive substance (NPS) use and harms
 New psychoactive substances (NPS) are substances which have similar acute psychoactive effects to 
established illicit drugs but are not controlled under international drug controls (41). 
 There has been a growth in the number of NPS notified to the EU early warning system for the first 
time (see figure below), although the rate growth in 2016 declined (42).
 This expanding production makes monitoring prevalence of NPS use challenging and there are 
substantial gaps in knowledge about the extent of NPS use. The UNODC World Drug Report 2017 
(10) listed estimates of prevalence of NPS use for only 15 countries since 2006.
 UNODC’s country-level estimates of past year NPS use (10) are typically <1% of the sampled 
population. They are mainly derived from adolescent and young adult samples and are typically 
specific to a NPS class (e.g., piperazines) or substance (e.g., mephedrone) (10). 
 Higher rates have been reported from the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other 
Drugs 2015 (11), with 3% of 15-16 year old European school students reporting any NPS use at least 
once in the past 12 months, with higher prevalence in Estonia and Poland (8%).
 Reported prevalence may be low amongst the general population but needs to be considered in the 
context of considerable epidemiological challenges in this area which include problems with the 
definition of NPS and a lack of standardized measurement tools.
 Indeed, self-report data are becoming less reliable for assessing drug groups like NPS where 
consumers may be unaware or misinformed of the substance they have consumed. Various indicators 
can be monitored and triangulated to better quantify NPS use and associated harms (e.g. ambulance 
attendances, emergency department presentations, poisons and toxicology data, and law enforcement 
drug seizures; 43).
 Key to monitoring NPS is early detection of NPS entering the market which have the capacity to 
cause substantial harm to the consumers, as illustrated by the recent emergence of highly potent 
synthetic opioids (42).
 Although NPS comprise a minority of the drugs for sale, surface and darknet websites (44) for this 
purpose, yielding timely and regular data on changes in the NPS market.

Note. Data in the table above were extracted from the GBD study 2015 (9). Age-standardised rates (Age SDR) is the rate per 100,000 people, estimated using the GBD world 
population age standard. Substance dependence was defined according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (14) and the International Classification 
of Diseases (15). Data are derived from systematic review of peer-review and grey literature, including estimates from studies published since 1980, and data were modelled 
using DisMod-MR 2.1. 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) were derived from 1000 draws from the posterior distribution in the estimation process. Data were available for 180 
countries for alcohol dependence, 55 countries for amphetamine dependence, 151 countries for cannabis dependence, 43 countries for cocaine dependence and 32 studies for

opioid dependence. In the GBD study, 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) are derived from 1000 draws from the posterior distribution of each step in the estimation process. The 
UIs capture uncertainty from multiple modelling steps and from sources such as model estimation and model specification. a Grouping of countries reflect GBD classification.

Note. Data in the table above were extracted from the GBD study 2015 related to disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and deaths attributable to substance use disorders (9).
Age-standardised rates is the rate per 100,000 people, estimated using the GBD world population age standard. Data are derived from systematic review of peer-review and 
grey literature, including estimates from studies published since 1980, and data were modelled using DisMod-MR 2.1. 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) were derived from 
1000 draws from the posterior distribution in the estimation process. In GBD, 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) are derived from 1000 draws from the posterior distribution of 
each step in the estimation process. The UIs capture uncertainty from multiple modelling steps and from sources such as model estimation and model specification. 
Uncertainty associated with estimation of mortality and YLLs reflects sample sizes of data sources, adjustment and standardisation methods applied to data, parameter 
uncertainty in model estimation, and uncertainty within all-cause and cause-specific mortality models. For estimation of prevalence and YLDs, UIs incorporated variability 
from sample sizes within data sources, adjustments to data to account for non-reference definitions, parameter uncertainty in model estimation, and uncertainty associated 
with establishment of disability weights (30).

Table 6: Estimating the size of the population that uses drugs
Method Summary Limitations
Population surveys Representative sample is directly asked 
about drug use in a specified time period.
Participants may be reluctant to disclose 
drug use due to illegality, stigma or 
concerns about confidentiality. 
Typically exclude groups with high levels 
of problematic drug use e.g. prisoners; 
homeless people (3).
Multiplier A benchmark (e.g. number of people 
receiving drug treatment in a year) is 
adjusted by a multiplier (e.g. proportion 
of people who use drugs who report 
receiving drug treatment in a year) to 
give a population size estimate.
Data used to generate multiplier may not 
be representative of the population of 
people who use drugs, giving a multiplier
that is too small or too large (45). 
Capture-recapture Population size is modelled based on the 
proportion of the population that is 
identified within more than one data 
source
Data sources may not be independent; e.g. 
criminal justice agencies may refer 
individuals to treatment agencies. This 
violates assumption of independence of 
capture-recapture models (25).
Network scale-up Population size is modelled based on 
reports from participants in general 
population samples on the number of 
people in the target population who are in 
their personal social network. 
Assumes that participants are aware of 
their social contacts being members of the 
target population and that members of the 
target population have a personal network 
of the same size as the general population
(27). 
Multiple parameter 
evidence synthesis
Bayesian synthesis of all available 
evidence, including potential biases 
affecting such evidence, to give an 
estimate that is consistent with all 
evidence and internally validated.
Complex relative to other methods and 
technically difficult to implement (27).
