Abstract
Background: Reliable estimates of the absolute and relative risks of postoperative complications in kidney
transplant recipients undergoing elective surgery are needed to inform clinical practice. This systematic review and
meta-analysis aimed to estimate the odds of both fatal and non-fatal postoperative outcomes in kidney transplant
recipients following elective surgery compared to non-transplanted patients.
Methods: Systematic searches were performed through Embase and MEDLINE databases to identify relevant
studies from inception to January 2020. Risk of bias was assessed by the Newcastle Ottawa Scale and quality of
evidence was summarised in accordance with GRADE methodology (grading of recommendations, assessment,
development and evaluation). Random effects meta-analysis was performed to derive summary risk estimates of
outcomes. Meta-regression and sensitivity analyses were performed to explore heterogeneity.
Results: Fourteen studies involving 14,427 kidney transplant patients were eligible for inclusion. Kidney transplant
recipients had increased odds of postoperative mortality; cardiac surgery (OR 2.2, 95%CI 1.9–2.5), general surgery
(OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.3–4.0) compared to non-transplanted patients. The magnitude of the mortality odds was
increased in the presence of diabetes mellitus. Acute kidney injury was the most frequently reported non-fatal
complication whereby kidney transplant recipients had increased odds compared to their non-transplanted
counterparts. The odds for acute kidney injury was highest following orthopaedic surgery (OR 15.3, 95% CI 3.9–
59.4). However, there was no difference in the odds of stroke and pneumonia.

Conclusion: Kidney transplant recipients are at increased odds for postoperative mortality and acute kidney injury
following elective surgery. This review also highlights the urgent need for further studies to better inform
perioperative risk assessment to assist in planning perioperative care.
Keywords: Perioperative outcomes, Surgical risk, Kidney transplant, Postoperative mortality, Myocardial infarction,
Stroke, Infection
Background
Patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) derive a
notable improvement in survival and quality of life com￾pared to patients who remain on chronic dialysis [1, 2].
However, kidney transplant recipients are a potentially
high risk surgical population for both fatal and non-fatal
cardiovascular, infectious, and wound complications, by
virtue of having a higher comorbid illness burden,
immunosuppression-related cardio-metabolic derange￾ments, and an augmented immune response [3]. The
evidence regarding the odds of adverse postoperative
outcomes in kidney transplant recipients is conflicting,
limited by small studies, and inconsistently adjust for
confounding factors. For example, a previous retrospect￾ive study of 1305 kidney transplant recipients reported
higher rates of in-hospital mortality following elective
colorectal surgery compared to the general population,
whereas another study of 70 kidney transplant recipients
reported no such differences following coronary artery
bypass grafting [4, 5]. Therefore, a systematic synthesis
of published literature on both fatal and non-fatal out￾comes of kidney transplant recipients undergoing elect￾ive surgery would help better inform shared decision
making by clinicians and patients.
The aim of this study was to perform a systematic re￾view and meta-analysis of kidney transplant recipients
undergoing elective non-transplant surgery to assess
their odds of both fatal and non-fatal post-operative out￾comes compared to patients with non-transplanted
patients.
Methods
This systematic review adhered to the Meta-analysis of
Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) pro￾posal for reporting [6] and Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guide￾lines [7], with a protocol registered in PROSPERO
(CRD42019127267).
Selection criteria and search strategy
All cohort studies comparing post-operative mortality
and morbidity in adult (aged 18 years or older) kidney
transplant recipients with non-transplanted patients in
the general population were considered for inclusion. All
types of surgery requiring a general anaesthetic were
considered, including general, orthopaedic, cardiac, vas￾cular and urological/gynaecological surgery. Kidney
transplantation and related urological procedures were
excluded. Studies in which more than 25% of the proce￾dures were emergent (defined as an acute illness leading
to an emergency presentation or an unplanned admis￾sion requiring a surgical procedure) were excluded be￾cause they have an inherently higher odds of
perioperative complications. Studies reporting aggregate
outcomes for a mixed population of solid organ trans￾plant recipients were included if > 70% of the population
comprised kidney transplant recipients.
We searched MEDLINE and Embase from inception
to January 2020, without language restriction using a
combination of relevant keywords including surgery, kid￾ney transplant, postoperative, perioperative, mortality
and their variants (see supplementary Table 1a and b).
Exploded MeSH terms for perioperative medicine and
kidney transplant recipients were also used. Full-text ar￾ticles obtained were hand searched for further refer￾ences. Tangential electronic exploration using links to
related texts was also performed for additional materials.
Case-control studies, opinion papers, case reports and
editorials were excluded.
Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), the
Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), National
Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) and the
NIHR Health Technology Assessment (NIHR HTA)
programme websites were all searched for existing reviews.
Data extraction and outcome definition
Two researchers (D.P & K.K) independently reviewed all
abstracts identified in the initial search to assess study
eligibility. Any disagreements were resolved by a third
reviewer (M.F). Type of surgery, patient numbers, sum￾mary statistics for baseline characteristics (including
baseline kidney function, immunosuppression, presence
of cardiovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease,
diabetes mellitus, hypertension and smoking status), and
frequency of post-operative outcomes in each group
were extracted from full-text manuscripts of eligible
studies. An individually tailored data request form was
used to obtain additional data from corresponding au￾thors, including aggregated summary data of kidney

transplant recipients baseline characteristics and
outcomes.
The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, defined
as either 30-day mortality or death within the same hos￾pitalisation as the index surgery. Secondary outcomes
were postoperative myocardial infarction, stroke, con￾gestive cardiac failure, pneumonia, surgical site infection
(both superficial and deep), sepsis, acute kidney injury
(AKI), thromboembolic events and return to theatre.
Outcome definitions of complications were noted at the
time of data extraction. The severity of each complica￾tion was measured using the Clavien-Dindo Classifica￾tion, which was used to evaluate the implications of
those postoperative complications on patients’ treatment
courses and outcomes [8]. The scale ranged from 1 to 5,
with Grade 1 referring to any deviation to the usual
postoperative course and Grade 5 complications leading
to postoperative death [9]. The methodological quality
of each study was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa
Scale (NOS) evaluating the selection of the study groups
(0–4 stars), comparability of the groups (0–2 stars), and
ascertainment of the outcome of interest (0–3 stars)
[10].
Statistical analysis
Publication bias was assessed using a funnel plot and
Egger’s test for funnel plot asymmetry. Cohen’s kappa
was calculated to assess inter-rater reliability of study se￾lection. Heterogeneity was assessed using I
2 using the t￾statistic for degrees of freedom due to the small number
of studies [11, 12].
Unadjusted odds ratios [OR] and 95% confidence in￾tervals (CIs) were calculated for both fatal and non-fatal
outcomes reported in each study to ensure consistency
using the absolute number of events in each group. Ad￾justed OR and 95% CI were recorded from studies that
performed a multivariable analysis, adjusting for age as a
minimum. As pre-specified in the protocol, odds ratio
estimates were calculated using the DerSimonian and
Laird (DL) method of random effects meta-analysis for
each surgical discipline. Further meta-analysis using the
Hartung-Knapp-Sidik- Jonkman method (HKSJ) was also
performed for comparison due to small number of stud￾ies [12].
Unadjusted and adjusted ORs for both primary and
secondary outcomes in kidney transplant recipients ver￾sus non-transplanted patients were pooled by surgical
disciplines, but not across disciplines due to differences
in risks inherent to a particular discipline, potential for
an interaction between surgical risk and transplant sta￾tus, and inability to exclude differential bias in selection
of surgical candidates. Meta-regression was performed
using the random effects model to assess whether the
unadjusted effect size was associated with important
study level covariates, including age and pre-operative
co-morbidity (ischemic heart disease and diabetes). Sen￾sitivity analyses, excluding studies reporting aggregated
outcomes involving other solid organ transplant recipi￾ents, were also conducted for all outcomes.
L’Abbé plots were used to explore studies with diver￾gent results and evaluate potential contributions of study
group characteristics to such differences [13]. Influence
analysis was also performed to evaluate the influence of
each study on the overall meta-analysis summary esti￾mate and identify outlier studies that may have had an
undue influence on results [14]. Six reviewers (D.P, E. P,
D. J, C. H, and M.F) discussed the overall strength of
evidence and graded it according to Grading of Recom￾mendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation
(GRADE) working group recommendations [15].
Statistical analysis was performed with Stata 14.0 for
Windows. Statistical significance was defined as a two￾sided p-value < 0.05.
Results
Study selection and characteristics
In total, 3448 abstracts were reviewed, from which 56
full-text articles were retrieved and evaluated (See Fig. 1).
Fourteen studies, involving 15,481 solid organ transplant
recipients of whom 14,427 (95%) were kidney trans￾plants, and 7,807,705 non-transplanted patients satisfied
the inclusion criteria (Table 1: Summary of included
studies). Non-emergent cardiac (5 studies) [5, 18, 20, 24,
27] and orthopaedic (5 studies) [16, 17, 19, 22, 23] sur￾gery were the most commonly reported types of surgery.
General surgical outcomes were reported in 3 studies [4,
21, 25]. A single study assessed outcomes following uro￾logical/gynaecological procedures [26] and there were no
studies in vascular surgery. Six studies assessed a single
surgical procedure [16, 17, 19, 22, 23, 26], while the re￾mainder examined a combination of discipline-specific
surgical interventions [4, 5, 18, 20, 21, 24, 25, 27]. All
but 4 studies [18, 21, 22, 24] were from North America.
Six of the 14 studies reported outcomes solely for kidney
transplant recipients [4, 16, 19, 21, 23, 25], while the
remaining eight studies presented outcomes collectively
for all solid organ transplants [5, 17, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 27].
Six studies defined clinical outcomes using the Inter￾national Classification of Disease Coding (ICD) [4, 16, 19,
23, 25, 27] whilst the others reviewed medical charts with￾out explicitly stated outcome definitions [5, 17, 18, 20–22,
24, 26]. Two studies used the Acute Kidney Injury Net￾work (AKIN) to define AKI [17, 22]. Only 2 studies re￾corded graft rejection as an outcome [18, 27].
All studies reported age and gender. Ten of the 14
studies reported baseline comorbidities including ische￾mic heart disease and diabetes mellitus [4, 5, 17, 18, 20,
22–25, 27]. However, only 4 studies reported kidney

transplant function preoperatively [5, 18, 20, 24]. No
studies differentiated outcomes based on living versus
deceased donor kidney status, kidney graft number or
time since transplantation. Neither the aetiology of
end-stage kidney disease nor the immunosuppression
regimen was reported to allow stratification of
outcomes based on immunosuppression doses and
protocols.
Risk of bias assessment
As per the NOS, cohort selection was of good quality,
but comparability was poor due to lack of multivariable

adjustment in only 5 of the 14 studies. In addition, out￾come reporting was also poor due to selective reporting
of and differences in outcome definitions (see Supple￾mentary Table 2). There was no significant evidence of
publication bias, as determined by funnel plot (Supple￾mentary Figure 3a and b) and Egger’s test (p = 0.31).
Inter-rater agreement between the two independent re￾viewers was very strong (κ = 0.83).
Meta-analysis of all-cause mortality
The incidence of all-cause mortality ranged between 0
and 16% in kidney transplant recipients, and between 0
and 5.7% in non-transplanted patients. Eight studies in￾volving 8151 transplant recipients reported unadjusted
mortality odds ratios (Fig. 2a). Compared to their non￾transplanted counterparts, the odds of mortality were
more than 2-fold higher in kidney transplant recipients
following cardiac surgery (5 studies, 2997 transplant re￾cipients, OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.88–2.53, I2 = 0.0% p for het￾erogeneity = 0.48, t = 11.6, low certainty evidence), and
similar following general surgery (3 studies, 5154 trans￾plant recipients, OR 2.22 95%CI 1.25–3.96, I2 = 85.6% p
for heterogeneity = 0.001, t = 1.9, very low certainty evi￾dence). Fatal outcomes were not reported by any of the
studies in the vascular or urological/gynaecological sur￾gical disciplines. A single study of orthopaedic proce￾dures reported an adjusted mortality risk ratio but did
not provide absolute event rates (3209 transplant recipi￾ents, OR 2.04, 95% CI 0.96–4.33, p = 0.06) [16]. Sensitiv￾ity analyses including only studies of kidney transplant
populations revealed similar odds using unadjusted data
(3 studies in general surgery, 5154 kidney transplant re￾cipients, OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.25–3.96, I2 85.6%, p for het￾erogeneity = 0.001, t = 1.9, Fig. 2b). Two general surgery
studies reported OR for mortality after multivariable ad￾justment. The mortality odds was similar to non￾transplanted patients (2 studies, 5070 transplant recipi￾ents, OR 1.26, 95% CI 0.76–1.77, I2 0%, p for heterogen￾eity = 0.75, t = 3.0). Meta-analysis results using the HKSJ
method were very similar to those from the DL method.
Results are summarised in Supplementary Table 3.
Meta-analysis of morbidity outcomes
Reporting of non-fatal complications was inconsistent
across studies: acute kidney injury was the most fre￾quently reported (11 studies), followed by pneumonia (8
studies), and stroke (7 studies). Thromboembolic com￾plications were the least frequently reported (3 studies)
(Fig. 1). None of the studies graded post-operative com￾plications by the Clavien-Dindo classification. Table 2
provides a summary of non-fatal outcomes and grading
of the certainty of evidence using GRADE. Meta-analysis
results using the HKSJ method were similar to those
from the DL method. Results are summarised in Supple￾mentary Table 3.
Cardiovascular events (stroke and myocardial infarction)
Across all surgical types, the incidences of postoperative
stroke in kidney transplant recipients ranged from 0 to
4.3%, and 0.9 to 4.0% for myocardial infarction. In non￾transplanted patients the incidence of stroke and myo￾cardial infarction ranged from 0.1 to 4.8% and 1.2 to
2.0%, respectively. The odds of stroke in kidney trans￾plant recipients following cardiac surgery was similar to
the general population (5 studies, 2997 transplant recipi￾ents, OR 1.36 95% CI 0.51–3.66, I2 = 53.5%, p for hetero￾geneity = 0.072, t- = 0.6, very low certainty evidence;
Supplementary Figure 4). Meta-analysis in other surgical
disciplines was not possible due to insufficient studies.
Meta-analysis for postoperative myocardial infarction
risk by surgical discipline and sensitivity analysis were
also not possible due to insufficient studies.
Infectious complications (pneumonia, surgical site
infections, sepsis)
Five of the eight studies that reported pneumonia in￾volved cardiac surgery where the incidence of postopera￾tive pneumonia ranged between 1.4 to 7.1% in kidney
transplant recipients and 3.8 to 7.1% in their non￾transplanted counterparts. The unadjusted odds of post￾operative pneumonia following cardiac surgery was simi￾lar between the two cohorts (5 studies, 2997 transplant
recipients, OR 1.10 95%CI 0.95–1.28, I2 = 0% p for het￾erogeneity = 0.573, t = 1.5, very low certainty evidence,
Supplementary Figure 5). Sensitivity analysis of kidney
only transplant recipients revealed similar odds (3 stud￾ies in general surgery, 5154 kidney transplant recipients,
OR 0.94 95% CI 0.28–3.22, I2 = 95.9% p for heterogen￾eity < 0.001, t = 0.1, very low certainty evidence). Pooling
of adjusted analyses was not possible due to the fact that
only one study in each of the other three disciplines re￾ported adjusted analysis. The odds of surgical site infec￾tions was also not significantly different, irrespective of
surgical discipline (4 cardiac studies, 2967 transplant re￾cipients, OR 1.08 95% CI 0.79–1.47, I2 = 0.0% p for het￾erogeneity = 0.805, t = 0.9, very low certainty evidence
and 3 general surgery studies, 5154 transplant recipients,
OR 1.43 95% CI 1.03–1.98, I2 = 75.7% p for heterogen￾eity 0.016, t = 1.4, very low certainty evidence, Supple￾mentary Figure 6).
Five studies reported sepsis as an outcome. The inci￾dence of postoperative sepsis ranged from 2.9 to 35.7%
in kidney transplant recipients, and between 1.7 to
14.3% in non-transplanted patients. The odds of sepsis
was increased more than 3-fold for kidney transplant re￾cipients following cardiac surgery (3 studies, 170 trans￾plant recipients, OR 3.14 95% CI 1.68–5.85, I2 = 0% p

numbers.
Acute kidney injury (AKI)
The incidences of postoperative AKI in kidney trans￾plant recipients ranged between 7.0 to 37.4% follow￾ing cardiac surgery, 10.0 and 11.7% after general
surgery, and 0 to 26.7% after orthopaedic surgery.
The odds of postoperative AKI was higher in kidney
transplant patients than in their non-transplanted
counterparts (Fig. 3). The odds was highest following
orthopaedic surgery (4 studies, 4095 transplant recipi￾ents, OR 15.26 95% CI 3.92–59.42, I2 = 93.6% p for
heterogeneity< 0.001, t = 3.4, moderate certainty evi￾dence) followed by cardiac surgery (5 studies, 2997
transplant recipients, OR 3.50 95% CI 2.08–5.88, I2 =
61.0% p for heterogeneity = 0.036, t = 4.4, low certainty
evidence). With the exception of two studies [20, 23],
the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval was
greater than 1.0 in all other individual studies. Ad￾justed odds estimates, with age as a minimum covari￾ate, were reported by 3 orthopaedic studies (OR 3.50
95% CI 2.73–4.27, I2 = 48% p = 0.146, t = 12.8) and a
single study involving general surgery (OR 2.02 95%
CI 1.42–2.63).
Other morbidity outcomes, including urinary tract in￾fections, return to theatre, transfusion requirements and
thromboembolic events, are summarised in Supplemen￾tary Table 3.
Heterogeneity
Mortality
The heterogeneity in the pooled estimate of the un￾adjusted mortality odds ratio varied from 0% in studies
involving cardiac surgery to 85.6% in general surgery.
Heterogeneity was significantly reduced in the adjusted
odds estimate (I2 0%, p = 0.65). L’Abbe plots did not
identify any studies that exerted disproportionate
influence on derived estimates of effect (Supplementary
Figure 1). Weighted univariable meta-regression analyses
of study-level characteristics demonstrated a significant
association between postoperative mortality and preva￾lence of diabetes mellitus (slope 0.03, p = 0.041; Supple￾mentary Figure 8), but not with the presence of
ischaemic heart disease. No significant association was
observed between postoperative mortality and other
study characteristics, such as single or multiple centre
design, or methodological study quality as assessed by
the Newcastle Ottawa Scale.
Morbidity
L’Abbe plots did not identify study cohorts that may
have explained the observed results (Supplementary Fig￾ure 2). Weighted univariable meta-regression to explore
heterogeneity of postoperative pneumonia and surgical
site infection odds estimates were not possible due to in￾sufficient study numbers. Meta-regression of AKI odds

and study-level patient characteristics, including age,
presence of diabetes mellitus and ischemic heart disease,
did not explain the observed difference. The influence of
other important factors, such as the use of calcineurin
inhibitors, deceased versus living donor kidney trans￾plant, time since transplantation, and baseline kidney
function, could not be evaluated as this information was
not made available to the authors.
Discussion
This systematic review and meta-analysis of 14 studies
involving 15,481 transplant recipients and 7,807,705
non-transplanted patients identified that kidney trans￾plant recipients have an increased odds of postoperative
death following elective cardiac and general surgery, es￾pecially in the setting of diabetes, and a substantially in￾creased odds of acute kidney injury. These findings
extend those of previous studies reporting increased
risks of postoperative mortality in individuals with non￾dialysis and dialysis-requiring chronic kidney disease [28,
29]. Thus, the presence of a kidney transplant is an im￾portant consideration when discussing peri-operative
risk with patients.
Whilst this review consistently demonstrated that kid￾ney transplant recipients were at increased odds of post￾operative mortality, the magnitude and cause of this
heightened odds remains uncertain. Meta-regression
demonstrated that the excess postoperative mortality
odds attributable to having a kidney transplant was fur￾ther increased by the presence of diabetes mellitus,
which is an established independent risk factor for post￾operative mortality [30]. This finding is of importance
given the increasing prevalence of obesity in the kidney
transplant recipient population and its association with
the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus [31]. The
reasons for a heightened postoperative mortality odds in
kidney transplant recipients could potentially be related
to the adverse immunologic, cardiovascular and meta￾bolic effects of immunosuppression. However, data on
cause of death were insufficient to explore mechanisms
of heightened risk. Cause of death was only reported in
a single study in which kidney transplant recipients who
developed an infectious complication had a higher mor￾tality odds than those who did not (OR 2.79; 95% CI
1.93–4.04) [25]. Whilst studies signalled an increased
odds of postoperative sepsis, the odds of other infective
complications, including surgical site infection and
pneumonia, were not appreciably different to those of
the general population. This may be explained by the
limited reporting of these postoperative complications in
cohort studies and the lack of standardised definitions.
Similar findings were observed for postoperative car￾diovascular outcomes. Specifically, the odds of postoper￾ative stroke in kidney transplant recipients was no
higher than that of non-transplanted patients. This ob￾servation is somewhat surprising given the fact that the
risk of premature cardiovascular disease after kidney
transplantation is reported in observational cohort stud￾ies to be three to five times that of the general popula￾tion [32]. This apparent discrepancy in findings may be
explained by selective outcome reporting and highlights
the need for accurate reporting of patient comorbidities,
preoperative kidney function, kidney disease aetiology,
immunosuppression regimen, cause of death and out￾comes according to standard definitions in studies of
kidney transplant recipients undergoing surgery. Never￾theless, current transplant guidelines recommend
screening for underlying coronary artery disease prior to
activation on the transplant wait list [33]. However,
there are no such recommendations when kidney trans￾plant recipients are considering elective surgery and cli￾nicians need to consider assessing risk based on
functional capacity as recommended by the American
College of Cardiology/American Heart Association
(ACC/AHA) [34].
The other key finding of this review was that the odds
of post-operative acute kidney injury in kidney trans￾plant recipients was considerably higher than in non￾transplanted patients in both unadjusted and sensitivity
analyses. A single study reported a higher incidence of
postoperative serum creatinine elevation in kidney trans￾plant recipients with a preoperative serum creatinine
greater than 176 μmol/L compared to those with lower
values (47.6% vs. 18.2%, p = 0.04) [5]. In the general
population, a higher preoperative serum creatinine is as￾sociated with an increased risk of developing a peri￾operative acute kidney injury [35]. In the absence of
access to patient-level data, adjustment for baseline kid￾ney transplant function was not possible across the stud￾ies. Furthermore, it is unclear what proportion of these
events was related to graft rejection, and if the injury
was severe enough to require temporary dialysis. Future
studies are needed to confirm these findings and the
long-term impact of postoperative acute kidney injury to
better facilitate informed decision making.
Although a comprehensive search strategy and rigor￾ous assessment of methodologic quality using a validated
tool were used, there were limitations which contributed
to the low certainty of evidence. Firstly, observational
studies and their subsequent meta-analyses are prone to
bias due to the inability to quantify and adjust for known
and unknown confounders. This was compounded by
the incomplete reporting of patient comorbidities, pre￾operative kidney function, precise immunosuppressive
regimens, selective reporting of clinical outcomes, and
variation of outcome definitions between studies. In
addition, assessment of publication bias using the funnel
plot was limited by small number of studies [36]. Meta￾Palamuthusingam et al. BMC Nephrology (2020) 21:365 Page 11 of 13

analysis of adjusted odds risks may have overcome some
of the limitations mentioned but these were poorly re￾ported. Secondly, selective reporting of non-fatal compli￾cations and lack of standardised classification of
complications using the Clavien-Dindo did not allow fair
comparison of outcomes between surgical types. Thirdly,
5% of the solid organ recipients were comprised of non￾kidney transplant recipients but this was necessary to
avoid excluding a number of key studies. Fourthly, there
were no studies available for inclusion involving poten￾tially high-risk surgical procedures such as elective vas￾cular surgery. Finally, as this study excluded patients
having emergent surgery, these results should not be ex￾trapolated beyond informing elective surgery risks.
Conclusion
Patients with a kidney transplant who undergo elective
surgery are at increased odds of postoperative mortality
compared to non-transplanted patients, with higher odds
among patients with diabetes mellitus. Kidney transplant
recipients are also at increased odds of postoperative
acute kidney injury, but the odds of postoperative car￾diovascular complications was no different between the
two groups. The findings of this review also highlight
the need for further studies to be more comprehensive
in reporting patient baseline characteristics, including
graft function and immunosuppression, as well as the
use of consistent outcome definitions and recording of
both short- and long-term graft outcomes. This will in￾form decision-making around the appropriateness of
elective surgery in kidney transplant recipients and allow
clinicians to adopt means to mitigate perioperative risk.
