Abstract
Background: Wolcott-Rallison syndrome (WRS) is characterized by permanent early-onset diabetes, skeletal
dysplasia and several additional features, e.g. recurrent liver failure. This is the first multicentre approach that focuses
on diabetes management in WRS. We searched the German/Austrian Diabetes-Patienten-Verlaufsdokumentation
(DPV) registry and studied anthropometric characteristics, diabetes treatment, glycaemic control and occurrence of
severe hypoglycaemia (SH) and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in 11 patients with WRS. Furthermore, all local treatment
centres were personally contacted to retrieve additional information on genetic characteristics, migration
background and rate of consanguinity.
Results: Data were analysed at diabetes onset and after a median follow-up period of 3 (1.5–9.0) years (time from
diagnosis to latest follow-up). Median age at diabetes onset was 0.2 (0.1–0.3) years, while onset was delayed in one
patient (aged 16 months). Seventy percent of patients manifested with DKA. At follow-up, 90% of patients were on
insulin pump therapy requiring 0.7 [0.5–1.0] IU of insulin/kg/d. More than two third of patients had HbA1c level ≥
8%, 40% experienced at least one episode of SH in the course of the disease. Three patients died at 0.6, 5 and 9
years of age, respectively. To the best of our knowledge three patients carried novel mutations in EIF2AK3.
Conclusion: Insulin requirements of individuals with WRS registered in DPV appear to be comparable to those of
preschool children with well-controlled type 1 diabetes, while glycaemic control tends to be worse and episodes of
SH tend to be more common. The majority of individuals with WRS in the DPV registry does not reach glycaemic
target for HbA1c as defined for preschool children (< 7.5%). International multicentre studies are required to further
improve our knowledge on the care of children with WRS.

Background
Wolcott-Rallison syndrome (WRS) is a rare autosomal
recessive disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations
in the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α kinase 3
(EIF2AK3) gene encoding pancreatic PKR-like endoplas￾mic reticulum kinase (PERK) that phosphorylates the
alpha subunit of the eukaryotic translation-initiation fac￾tor 2 (eIF2-alpha) [1]. Its cardinal clinical manifestations
as initially described by CD Wolcott and ML Rallison in￾clude non-autoimmune permanent early-onset diabetes
mellitus and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia [2]. Several
additional features have been described, whose presence
and severity vary between patients. These may be
present upon diagnosis or develop later during the
course of the disease and include recurrent episodes of
hepatic failure (in up to 85% of patients [3]), impaired
renal function, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, osteo￾penia, growth retardation, anaemia, neutropenia associ￾ated with recurrent infections, hypothyroidism during
stress conditions (referred to as the euthyroid sick syn￾drome) and developmental delay [4, 5]. However, clinical
appearance highly varies among patients, even in those
sharing the same mutation [3, 4, 6–9]. Although a rare
disease, WRS is the most common cause of permanent
neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM) in consanguineous
families where it accounts for up to 25% of cases [4, 9,
10]. Diabetes typically manifests within the first 6
months of life but delayed onset up to 30 months of age
has also been reported [3, 6]. Acute episodes of diabetic
ketoacidosis (DKA) are common [11–13]. Given the ex￾tensive phenotypic variability, it has been proposed to
consider WRS in any infant with permanent early-onset
diabetes mellitus born from consanguineous parents or
originating from isolated populations or countries in
which inbreeding is frequent [4].
Diabetes in WRS is not autoimmune, therefore type 1
diabetes specific islet autoantibodies are absent [11].
Instead, studies on tissue-specific knockout and PERK￾deficient cell-lines revealed that PERK is required for
normal fetal and early neonatal beta cell proliferation,
differentiation and beta cell function [14]. Consistently,
the pancreas of patients with WRS is hypoplastic, Lang￾erhans islets are smaller and insulin-secreting beta cells
are markedly reduced within the islets [11].
Liver disease is a common manifestation of WRS,
present in up to 85% of individuals with WRS, and asso￾ciated with high mortality rates [3]. The majority of indi￾viduals with WRS experience intermittent episodes of
acute liver failure with or without cholestasis, typically
triggered by stress such as intercurrent disease or
hypoglycaemia related to tight diabetes control. Likewise,
management of WRS is often complicated by recurrent
episodes of hypoglycaemia secondary to liver dysfunc￾tion with impaired hepatic gluconeogenesis [3, 11, 12].
In individuals with WRS, optimal diabetes management
is therefore of particular importance to prevent diabetic
ketoacidosis as well as episodes of hypoglycaemia with
possible subsequent liver failure. The aim of this study
was to characterize the management of diabetes in pa￾tients diagnosed with WRS. We searched the German/
Austrian DPV (Diabetes-Patienten-Verlaufsdokumenta￾tion) database and studied the course of diabetes in 11
patients diagnosed with WRS. Additional information
was retrieved by personally contacting all local treatment
centres. Data were compared at diabetes onset and after
a median follow-up period of 3 [1.5–9] years (median
[Q1-Q3]) (time from diagnosis to latest follow-up).
Thus, we provide objective information on anthropo￾metric, clinical and genetic characteristics of individuals
with WRS as well as their diabetes treatment and gly￾caemic control including occurrence of DKA and severe
hypoglycaemia (SH).
Results
Patient characteristics
Eleven patients with the diagnosis of WRS are cur￾rently registered in the German/Austrian DPV data￾base. Of these, three were male (27%) and all patients
for whom this information was available had a migra￾tion background (100%, n = 10). One Austrian and
one German patient of Kosovo-origin have previously
been described (patient 7 and patient 9) [4, 15]. Me￾dian age at diabetes onset was 0.2 (0.1–0.3) years
(n = 11). At the most recent treatment year (follow-up
data), patients were 2 (1.8–12.0) years old, with a me￾dian duration of diabetes of 3 (1.5–9.0) years (n = 11).
BMI-SDS was − 0.25 (− 1.1 − + 0.9, n = 9). Three pa￾tients died at 0.6, 5 and 9 years, respectively
(Table 1).
Diabetes management, glycaemic control and diabetes￾related complications
Data on diabetes management, glycaemic control and
diabetes-related complications are summarized in
Table 2. All patients were treated with insulin. Data on
diabetes management (insulin dose) and glycaemic con￾trol (HbA1c level) were available for six and five patients
from diabetes onset, and for all patients from the most
recent treatment year (follow-up).
At the most recent treatment year, the vast majority of
patients were treated with CSII (90%). One patient was
treated with multiple daily insulin injections at 4 injec￾tion time-points per day. The total daily insulin dose of
individuals with WRS registered in DPV was 3.5 (3–4.3)
IU at diabetes onset (n = 4) and 9.6 (6.8–12.6) IU at
follow-up (n = 10). Insulin dose per kg body weight was
0.7 (0.5–0.9) IU at diabetes onset (n = 6) and 0.7 (0.5–1)
IU at follow-up (n = 11).
Welters et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases (2020) 15:100 Page 2 of 8

Most patients had an increased HbA1c level at dia￾betes onset (7 [5.8–10.9] %; n = 5). As diabetes pro￾gressed, glycaemic control further deteriorated and
HbA1c reached a level of 8.0 (7.8-9) % at follow-up
(n = 11).
Data on the presence of DKA at diabetes manifestation
were available for 10 patients. Of these, seven patients
presented with DKA (70%). One patient experienced one
further episode of DKA during follow-up. 40% of the pa￾tients experienced at least one episode of severe
hypoglycaemia within the course of the disease.
Genetic characteristics and migration background
Data on the underlying genetic mutation were available
for 9 patients (Table 3). Of these, six patients carried a
previously described mutation in EIF2AK3: the homozy￾gous c.2707C > T, p.Arg903* mutation was detected in
five individuals, of which two were siblings. All patients
carrying this mutation were of Albanian- or Kosovo￾origin and born to un-related parents. Two of these pa￾tients have previously been described [4, 15]. Notably, in
patient 9 the nomenclature differs by one amino acid
(c.2704C > T, p.Arg902*) because a different reference
sequence for the mutation was applied [4]. The
c.997C > T, p.Gln333* mutation was detected in one
German patient of Iraqi-origin born to consanguineous
parents. To the best of our knowledge three patients car￾ried a novel mutation in EIF2AK3: the compound het￾erozygous mutation c.1474 C > T, p.(Arg492*); c.2081
C > G, p.(Ser694*) was detected in a German female with
WRS of Syrian-origin, the homozygous mutation c.1A >
G, p.Met? was detected in a female with WRS of
Afghan-origin and the c.568_575dupGATGATGT,
p.Val193Metfs10* mutation was detected in a German
female with WRS of Russian-origin. All except one pa￾tient carried a homozygous mutation in EIF2AK3. The
only patient that carried a compound heterozygous mu￾tation was a German female of consanguineous Syrian
parents. Information on the migration background was
available for 10 patients (Table 3). Of these, all patients
had a migration background: two patients had immi￾grated themselves and 8 patients had parents that had
immigrated. The majority of patients originated from re￾gions with a high level of inbreeding (Turkey, Syria,
Afghanistan, Iraq) or isolated populations (Kosovo,
Albania) [16, 17]. One patient was of Russian-descent.
Discussion
This is the first study to focus on diabetes management
in WRS. We studied anthropometric characteristics, dia￾betes treatment, glycaemic control, diabetes-related
complications (SH and DKA) and genetic characteristics
in 11 patients with WRS registered in the German/Aus￾trian DPV registry.
The key presenting feature of WRS is PNDM. In
Europe and within the DPV registry, the most common
causes of PNMD are activating mutations in ABCC8 or
KCNJ11 encoding one of the subunits of the ATP￾sensitive potassium channel (KATP) [10, 18]. However, in
populations in which inbreeding is frequent, e.g. in
North Africa, Middle East and South Asia, KATP channel
mutations are less common [5]. Instead, in consanguin￾eous populations, EIF2AK3 mutations causing WRS ac￾count for up to 25% of PNDM cases [5, 9, 10].

Consistently, in the DPV cohort all patients for whom
this information was available had a migration back￾ground, meaning that the patients themselves had immi￾grated (n = 2) or their parents were born outside the
DPV countries (n = 8). All except one patient originated
from regions with a high level of inbreeding (Turkey,
Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq) or rather small ethnic groups
(Kosovo, Albania) [16, 17]. However, the rate of self￾reported parental consanguinity was low (n = 2). All
except one patient for whom information on the under￾lying mutation was available carried a homozygous
mutation in EIF2AK3. The only patient that carried a
compound heterozygous mutation was a German girl of
consanguineous Syrian parents. Five patients, of which
two were siblings, shared the same mutation in EIF2AK3
(c.2707C > T, p.Arg903*). All of these patients were of
Albanian- or Kosovo-origin and born to un-related par￾ents. This mutation has previously been described in at
least three additional individuals with WRS of Albanian￾origin, further supporting the assumption of a founder
effect in this population [17, 19, 20]. One German male
individual with WRS of Iraqi-origin carried the homozy￾gous mutation c.997C > T, p.Gln333* in EIF2AK3. This
mutation has previously been described in three patients
of Iranian-, Turkish- and Kurdish-origin, respectively [9,
21, 22].
In most children with WRS, diabetes manifests within
the first 6 months of life, typically at around two to 3
months of age, but delayed onset at 14, 18, 24 and even
30 months has also been reported [3, 4, 6, 23]. Similarly,
in this cohort all except one patient presented with dia￾betes before 4 months of age. Median age at diabetes on￾set was 0.2 (0.1–0.3) years. One patient was diagnosed at
the age of 16 months and thus expands the number of
individuals with WRS with delayed onset.
The majority of individuals with WRS in the DPV
registry were on insulin pump therapy (90%), which is
the preferred mode of insulin delivery for paediatric

patients with type 1 diabetes aged < 7 years [24]. Daily
insulin dose per kg bodyweight (IU/kg/d) in this cohort
of individuals with WRS was 0.7 (0.5–0.9) IU at diabetes
onset and 0.7 (0.5–1) IU at follow-up in patients aged 2
(1.8–12) years. Thus, insulin requirements of individuals
with WRS appear to be comparable to that of preschool
children with well-controlled type 1 diabetes mellitus
(T1DM), requiring insulin doses of approximately 0.6
IU/kg/d [24], albeit the number of patients with WRS
studied is too small to statistically compare these two
groups.
Individuals with WRS tend to develop recurrent
episodes of DKA and hypoglycaemia [3, 11–13]. In
the DPV registry, seven patients presented with DKA
(70%). Notably, patient 10 was closely monitored to
prevent DKA, as her sister (patient 11) had been di￾agnosed with WRS. These observations are in line
with previous reports. It has been reported that up
to 65% of patients with any type of monogenic dia￾betes present with DKA [25]. Similarly, in other co￾horts, 50–70% of individuals with WRS presented
with DKA [3, 5]. 40% of individuals with WRS in
the DPV registry experienced at least one episode of
SH during follow-up and 20% of individuals with
WRS experienced an episode of SH within the past
treatment year. Thus, the frequency of SH tends to
be higher in individuals with WRS compared to indi￾viduals with type 1 diabetes: 1.9% and 2.8% of chil￾dren with T1DM aged < 6 years registered in DPV
and the T1D Exchange clinic registry, a multisite
registry that includes T1DM patients at all ages in
the USA, respectively, experienced ≥ episode of SH
within the past treatment year [26]. Preclinical studies
revealed that in mice with a homozygous mutation of
eIF2-alpha hypoglycaemic episodes are associated with
defective hepatic gluconeogenesis [27]. Likewise, it
has been hypothesized that in human individuals
with WRS, mutant for the eIF2-alpha kinase PERK,
liver dysfunction adds to the risk of developing
hypoglycaemic episodes [11]. Therefore, regular
daytime feeds may assist in preventing severe
hypoglycaemia [28]. Of note, in WRS hypoglycaemia
can trigger acute hepatic failure, and liver disease in
WRS carries high mortality [3].
This study further revealed that less than one third of
individuals with WRS in the DPV registry reached gly￾caemic targets for HbA1c as defined by the International
Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD)
and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) for pre￾school children (HbA1c < 7.5%; n = 3) [24, 29]. Mean
HbA1c was 8.0 (7.8-9) % in individuals with WRS aged 2
(1.8-12) years and thus tends to be higher than in indi￾viduals with T1DM aged < 6 years from the DPV registry
(HbA1c of 7.1% in users of continuous glucose
monitoring [CGM] and 7.4% in non-CGM users) [30].
More than two thirds of individuals with WRS had
HbA1c level ≥ 8% (n = 8). Higher HbA1c level may gen￾erally be tolerated rather than targeting a very tight con￾trol of blood glucose, as hypoglycaemia can trigger acute
liver failure. Today, prognosis of WRS is poor and most
patients die at a young age before long-term complica￾tions of diabetes become clinically evident [11, 31].
However, earlier recognition of WRS and increased
awareness of additional features, particularly liver failure,
may improve the care of children with WRS and lead to
prolonged survival. Given their relatively poor metabolic
control and young age at diabetes onset, these patients
may have a high risk of developing long-term complica￾tions of diabetes [31].
Three of the individuals with WRS registered in DPV
have died. One 7-months-old girl died of multiple organ
failure following progressive kidney and liver dysfunc￾tion. One 5-year old girl died at her home, which is why
the cause of death remains unclear. In the months be￾fore her death, she frequently suffered from severe meta￾bolic derangement with simultaneous electrolyte
imbalances that were increasingly difficult to manage.
Presumably, the patient died in such a crisis. Notably,
one 9-year old girl died from cerebral oedema following
an elective surgical intervention for craniocervical in￾stability without additional signs of organ failure. There￾fore, as recommended by others, in individuals with
WRS general anaesthesia should be planned with cau￾tion and closely monitored to prevent acute aggravation
of the disease [32].
This study has several limitations. Although it is one
of the largest studies to date that focuses on diabetes
management and outcomes of diabetes care in individ￾uals with WRS, the number of patients with WRS stud￾ied is too small to statistically compare diabetes
management in WRS and type 1 diabetes, particularly
when adjusting for confounding factors. This is why we
did not statistically compare these two groups. However,
a comparison with the treatment of other forms of dia￾betes must be attempted, as it has important implica￾tions for the treatment of diabetes in individuals with
WRS. Therefore, we describe and discuss our observa￾tions in the context of type 1 diabetes treatment. Cer￾tainly, additional studies are required to further expand
the knowledge of diabetes management in WRS to im￾prove the care and long-term outcome of individuals
with this disorder.
Since the DPV registry primarily records data on dia￾betes management and diabetes-related comorbidities,
data on clinical features of WRS other than diabetes,
genetic characteristics and migration background were
scarce or not available. Efforts have been made to obtain
additional information through personally contacting
Welters et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases (2020) 15:100 Page 5 of 8

each treatment centre (Table 3). However, as this is a
retrospective and multicentre database analysis, clinical
manifestations of WRS other than diabetes could not be
studied in detail.
Conclusions
Wolcott-Rallison syndrome is a rare disorder and only
little is known about the management of diabetes and
glycaemic control in individuals with WRS. In WRS, dia￾betes manifests early in life, often with DKA. In the DPV
cohort all patients for whom this information was avail￾able had a migration background and the majority of
patients originated from countries with a high level of
inbreeding or rather small ethnic groups. Insulin re￾quirements of individuals with WRS appear to be com￾parable to preschool children with well-controlled
T1DM. Glycaemic control as measured by HbA1c tends
to be worse than in T1DM patients aged < 6 years regis￾tered in DPV. In fact, most of the individuals with WRS
did not reach glycaemic target for HbA1c (< 7.5%), while
almost half of the patients experienced at least one epi￾sode of severe hypoglycaemia (40%). We conclude that
in WRS, diabetes needs intensive treatment, should be
well educated and closely monitored to achieve optimal
glycaemic control in order to minimize the risk of DKA
and SH and to prevent long-term complications of dia￾betes. Beyond appropriate education, psychological sup￾port should be offered to parents of individuals with
WRS, as insulin therapy in infants as such is a challenge
[33]. Additional studies are required to further improve
the care of children with WRS.
Materials and methods
DPV registry
The DPV registry is a nationwide prospective multicen￾tre initiative that records demographic and anthropo￾metric characteristics as well as data on diabetes
management and diabetes-related comorbidities of chil￾dren and adults with any type of diabetes. Currently, 485
centres in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and
Luxembourg participate in the DPV initiative. Twice a
year, each centre transmits its data in an anonymous
form to the University of Ulm, Germany for central data
aggregation and analysis. Inconsistent data are reported
back to centres for verification or correction. Until
September 2019, 564.734 patients with diabetes were
registered in the electronic computer based documenta￾tion software DPV. Data collection and the analysis of
anonymized data from the DPV registry are approved by
the ethics committee of the University of Ulm, Germany
and by local review boards of the participating centres.
For the present analysis we included all subjects with
the clinical diagnosis of WRS recorded in the DPV regis￾try. For each patient, data at diabetes onset and from the
most recent treatment year were extracted and analysed.
Local treatment centres were furthermore contacted to
obtain additional information on diabetes management,
genetic characteristics and migration background. The
study sample encompassed 11 patients with the diagno￾sis of WRS from 9 different centres in Germany (n = 8)
and Austria (n = 1).
Data analysis and statistics
Anthropometric and clinical data analysed include sex,
age at diabetes onset and at the most recent visit (fol￾low-up), migration background (at least one parent or
patient born outside the DPV countries), body mass
index SD score (BMI-SDS) at follow-up, glycated
haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level at diabetes onset and at
follow-up (%), diabetes duration, type of insulin treat￾ment, daily insulin dose, presence of DKA at diabetes
onset and of DKA and SH at follow-up. SH was defined
according to the ISPAD guidelines, i.e. an event associ￾ated with seizure, convulsion or loss of consciousness
requiring the assistance of another person. DKA was de￾fined as venous pH < 7.3 and/or serum bicarbonate < 15
mmol/l [34].
HbA1c level from different centres were mathematic￾ally standardized to the reference range of the Diabetes
Control and Complication Trial (DCCT) (4.05–6.05%).
BMI was calculated as weight in kg divided by the
square of the height in meters (kg/m2
). The German
Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children
and Adolescents (KiGGS study) was used as national ref￾erence data to derive BMI-SDS values [35].
Insulin treatment was categorized as multiple daily
insulin injections or continuous subcutaneous insulin
infusion (CSII). Insulin dose is expressed as total daily
