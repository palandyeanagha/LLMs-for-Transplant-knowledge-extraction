Abstract. Melatonin, a widespread physiological mediator, 
has been demonstrated to exhibit a dose‑dependent immu￾noregulatory effect in vitro and in vivo, including mediating 
physiological circadian rhythms, neutralizing free radicals 
and exerting antisenescence actions. In the present study, 
the efficacy and mechanism of melatonin alone or in 
combination with cyclosporine (CsA) in prolonging heart 
transplantation survival was examined. Daily treatment with 
melatonin (200 mg/kg/day) through a gavage, significantly 
prolonged the survival of cardiac grafts (mean survival time, 
13.4±2.4 days; n=7; P<0.0001) compared with the untreated 
controls (5.8±1.2 days; n=7). When CsA (5 mg/kg/day) was 
co‑administered with melatonin (50 mg/kg/day), the survival 
rate improved (31.6±2.4 days; n=7; P<0.001), compared with 
that achieved by only 20 mg/kg/day CsA (22±2.8 days; n=7). 
As expected, melatonin significantly alleviated the inflamma￾tory response and apoptosis as determined by TdT‑mediated 
dUTP‑biotin nick end labeling assay (P<0.05). Further anal￾ysis demonstrated that melatonin significantly reduced p65 
activation and the release of inflammatory factors. Therefore, 
these findings indicate that melatonin in combination with 
CsA protected the cardiac allograft by inhibiting inflamma￾tion‑induced apoptosis. These results provide evidence for a 
novel therapeutic approach for future immunosuppressive 
agents in organ transplantation.
Introduction
Cardiac transplant is a useful therapeutic tool for the treatment 
of patients with end‑stage heart failure or severe coronary 
artery disease (1). Despite marked effort and advances made 
during the past few years, with improved immunosuppres￾sion regimens and post‑operative care, there are a number of 
problems that remain to be resolved, including poor long‑term 
cardiac allograft outcomes, infections and malignancies (2‑4). 
The introduction of cyclosporine (CsA) in immunosuppressive 
therapy has greatly improved the clinical outcome of cardiac 
transplantation (5,6). However, the side effects of CsA, including 
irreversible pulmonary hypertension, infection and cancer, are 
serious limitations due to the high dosage required (7,8). More 
recent strategies have focused on using cell therapies from 
different sources to facilitate stimulating the regeneration 
of cells inside the transplanted heart. However, the effect of 
differentiation on the expression profile of MHC proteins in 
allogeneic cell therapies is largely unknown (9). The develop￾ment of a novel, short‑term and effective immunomodulatory 
strategy is urgently required.
Melatonin, secreted by the pineal gland, is a widespread 
physiological mediator (10). Melatonin is a multifunctional 
gene, affecting various systems, including regulating 
circadian rhythm, immunoregulation, anti‑oxidative effect 
and infection (11). Early evidence indicated that melatonin 
regulates the expression of Th1/2 cytokines, including tumor 
necrosis factor‑α (TNF‑α), γ‑interferon, interleukin (IL)‑12, 
IL‑1, IL‑2 and macrophage colony‑stimulating factor (11,12). 
Rats supplemented with high (50 mg/kg) doses of melatonin 
exhibited significantly elevated survival times due to the abro￾gation of alloimmune responses (13). Further investigation has 
demonstrated that immunosuppressive maintenance therapy 
with CsA and rapamycin affected endogenous melatonin 
secretion (14). Melatonin has exhibited a protective action 
against CsA‑induced oxidative stress, nephrotoxic effects and 
autophagy in vivo or in vitro (15‑17). Previous studies have 
demonstrated that high‑dose melatonin treatment prolonged 
cardiac allograft survival without side effects (13). However, 
the combined effect of melatonin plus CsA remains to be eluci￾dated and the molecular regulatory mechanisms are unclear.
In the present study, it was determined whether co‑treat￾ment with melatonin and CsA was able to improve the survival 
of cardiac allografts. In addition, the possible mechanisms 
underlying this effect were investigated.

polypropylene cages (three rats per cage) in a constant temper￾ature (22±2˚C) with a 12‑h light and dark cycle. The care of 
the animals and experimental protocols was approved by the 
Animal Care and Use Committee of Fudan College of Science 
(Shanghai, China).
Animal experiments. Inbred SD rats and inbred Wistar rats 
were used as the recipients and donors, respectively. A total 
of 40 allogenic heart‑transplanted SD rats were randomly 
divided into four groups of ten. Donor heart grafts were 
transplanted into the abdominal cavity of SD recipients 
using standard microsurgical techniques under sterile condi￾tions. The saline group and the other three groups were 
administered 200 mg/kg/day melatonin (Sigma, St. Louis, 
MO, USA), 20 mg/kg/day CsA and 50 mg/kg/day melatonin 
with 5 mg/kg/day CsA, respectively. The rate and strength of 
allograft pulsations were determined each day to check the 
survival times. Rejection was defined as heartbeat cessation 
for one day.
TdT‑mediated dUTP‑biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. 
For the detection of DNA strand breaks, paraffin‑embedded 
sections were stained with the in situ cell death detection kit 
(Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA) according to the 
manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, formalin‑fixed sections 
were dehydrated in alcohol and defatted in xylenes. Following 
being permeabilized in proteinase K for 10 min, endogenous 
peroxidase was deactivated by 0.3% hydrogen peroxide. Next, 
the sections were incubated with 10 µl TUNEL reaction 
mixture, containing terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase 
and fluorescein isothiocyanate dUTP, for 60 min at 37˚C. 
These sections were then stained with 3, 3'‑diaminobenzidine, 
following hematoxylin post‑staining, and observed under an 
optical microscope (4XC‑MS; Shanghai Lunjie Mechanical 
and Electronical Instrument Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). 
TUNEL‑positive cells were counted in twelve randomly 
selected fields from each slide at a magnification of x200. 
The percentage of TUNEL‑positive cells was analyzed in ten 
cardiac sections from ten different rats.
Immunohistochemistry. All of the fresh tissues were fixed 
in 10% neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. 
A total of 5‑µm paraffin‑embedded sections were cut on a 
microtome and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) 
and Masson's trichrome according to the standard proce￾dures. Generally, the 5‑µm paraffin‑embedded sections 
were de‑paraffinized in a series of xylene and hydrated in a 
graded series of ethanol. The sections were washed briefly in 
distilled water and stained in hematoxylin solution for 10 min. 
Histological specimens were evaluated by the International 
Society of Heart and Lung Tranplantation (ISHLT) grading 
system (18) with an optical microscope (4XC‑MS; Shanghai 
Lunjie Mechanical and Electronical Instrument Co., Ltd.).
IL‑2 and TNF‑α determination. Serum was prepared from 
the blood collected five days following heart transplantation. 
The levels of IL‑2 and TNF‑α were measured in the plasma 
acquired from the ELISA assay, which was stimulated with 
saline, melatonin, CsA or melatonin with CsA. IL‑2 ELISAs 
were performed using the reagents and instructions provided 
by the manufacturer (Rat IL‑2 Quantikine ELISA kit; R&D 
Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA). TNF‑α ELISAs were 
performed using the reagents and instructions provided by 
the manufacturer (Rat TNF‑α Quantikine ELISA kit; R&D 
Systems Inc.). All of the plasma specimens were examined in 
duplicate and expressed in pg/ml.
Western blot analysis. The lysis of the frozen left ventricle tissue 
samples were harvested in RIPA lysis buffer with proteinase 
inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics, Ltd., Lewes, UK), sonicated for 
30 sec and finally centrifuged for 30 min at 16,200 x g. The 
proteins (~60 µg protein) from the total tissue samples were 
resolved by the 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate‑polyacrylamide 
gel electrophoresis and then transferred to the pure nitrocel￾lulose membrane (Bio‑Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Blocking 
was performed with 5% non‑fat dry milk overnight at 4˚C and 
incubated with mouse monoclonal Bcl‑2 antibody (Proteintech 
Group Inc., Wuhan, China; cat no. 60178‑1‑Ig), mouse mono￾clonal IL‑1β antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, 
MA, USA; cat no. 8689), rabbit polyclonal Phospho‑NF‑κB 
p65 (Ser536) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.; cat 
no. 3031), rabbit polyclonal NF‑κB p65 (C22B4; Cell Signaling 
Technology, Inc.; cat no. 4764) and rabbit polyclonal β‑actin 
(Sigma; cat no. A2066) overnight at 4˚C. The western blots 
were processed using a horseradish peroxidase goat anti‑rabbit 
IgG (Shanghai Kangcheng Bioengineering Co., Ltd., 
Shanghai, China). The Pierce enhanced chemiluminescence 
Western Blotting Substrate was used for chemiluminescence 
detection according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce 
Biotechnology, Inc., Rockford, IL, USA). Densitometric 
analysis of protein was conducted using Bio‑Rad Quantity 
One® 1‑D software (Bio‑Rad).
Statistical analysis. Each experiment was performed at least 
three times and the representative data were collected. Data 
are presented as the mean ± standard deviation. Differences 
between the four groups were determined using one‑way anal￾ysis of variance. The statistical analysis was performed using 
the GraphPad Prism V5.03 software (GraphPad, San Diego, 
CA, USA). P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically 
significant difference.
Results
Melatonin with CsA markedly prolongs cardiac allograft 
survival. Previous studies have demonstrated that melatonin is 
able to suppress acute cardiac allograft rejection in vivo. The 
present study investigated the effects on acute cardiac allograft 
rejection of melatonin only, CsA only and melatonin with 
CsA. As revealed in Fig. 1, the survival times of hearts trans￾planted to animals treated with melatonin were significantly 
prolonged compared with the untreated control in a rat cardiac 
allograft model starting at the day of transplantation. However 
its efficacy was less than that of 20 mg/kg CsA. By contrast, 
50 mg/kg melatonin in combination with 5 mg/kg CsA was 
more effective than the sole administration of 20 mg/kg CsA 
(Fig. 1). These data indicated that melatonin exhibits a benefi￾cial effect on allograft survival and may offer the possibility 
of reducing the dose of CsA used in patients, thereby limiting 
the potential for severe side effects.

Melatonin suppresses inflammatory responses in vivo. 
Imbalances in inflammatory processes are important in the 
pathogenesis of immune rejection. In order to examine acute 
immune rejection in the myocardium, H&E‑stained sections 
were evaluated using the ISHLT grading system (18). As 
demonstrated in Fig. 2B and C, the cardiac histopathology 
revealed that 50 mg/kg melatonin and 20 mg/kg CsA was 
able to extenuate the inflammatory reaction. While 50 mg/kg 
melatonin co‑administrated with 5 mg/kg CsA significantly 
alleviated heart congestion (Fig. 2D). The rejection grade 
diagnosed by ISHLT confirmed the histological results 
(Fig. 2E). Further analysis revealed that treatment with mela￾tonin significantly attenuated the release of inflammatory 
cytokines, including IL‑2 and TNF‑α (Fig. 2F and G). These

results suggested that melatonin attenuated immune rejection 
by reducing the activation of inflammatory responses.
Melatonin protects against apoptosis of cardiac myocytes. The 
number of apoptotic cardiac myocytes increased markedly in 
association with the increased infiltration of macrophages into 
the myocardial tissue during the course of cardiac allograft 
rejection. Melatonin has been reported to exhibit an antiapop￾totic effect in other tissues. Thus, the present study investigated 
the role of melatonin on apoptosis in myocardial tissue on 
day five following transplantation. Apoptosis was observed 
in all myocardial tissue and the number of apoptotic cardiac 
myocytes significantly reduced in the allografts treated with 
200 mg/kg melatonin or 20 mg/kg CsA, compared with in the 
allografts administered saline (Fig. 3A‑C). When 50 mg/kg 
melatonin with less CsA 5 mg/kg was administered to the 
animals, the proportion of apoptotic cardiac myocytes was 
6‑fold lower than the saline group and 2‑fold lower than the 
rats treated with melatonin or CsA alone (Fig. 3D). These data 
suggested that melatonin significantly reduces the number of 
TUNEL‑positive cells.
Expression levels of p65, Bcl‑2 and IL‑1β in left ventricular 
tissue. To examine the possible mechanisms underlying the 
improvement of allograft survival in melatonin‑treated rats, 
the present study focused on the expression of p65, Bcl‑2 and 
IL‑1β, which are key genes in inflammation and apoptosis. 
As expected, it was identified that the expression of p‑p65 
(Ser536) also significantly decreased in the 200 mg/kg mela￾tonin or 20 mg/kg CsA‑treated rats in comparison with the 
saline‑treated animals (Fig. 4A). Consistent with p‑p65, the 
expression of IL‑1β was also reduced and the level of Bcl‑2

was upregulated (Fig. 4). Notably, 50 mg/kg melatonin with 
5 mg/kg CsA have an effective inhibition on the expression of 
p‑p65 (Ser536) and IL‑1β (Fig. 4). These data indicated that 
melatonin may inhibit immune rejection to reduce the release 
of inflammatory cytokines that induce apoptosis.
Discussion
In the present study, it was demonstrated that allograft viability 
is prolonged by direct modulation of host immunity via 
concomitant immunosuppression with melatonin‑treatment 
by utilizing a well‑characterized experimental rat cardiac 
transplantation model. Melatonin ameliorated prolonged 
inflammation and the associated release of proinflammatory 
cytokines and chemokines, which lead to transplant pathology. 
Serum levels of TNF‑α and IL‑2 were significantly reduced 
in vitro in the presence of melatonin and/or CsA, which may 
contribute to enhanced cardiac allograft survival.
These data in a heart transplant model suggested that mela￾tonin effectively prolongs the survival of cardiac allografts

and reduces the dose of CsA. CsA has a marked beneficial effect 
in organ transplantation in vivo and in vitro, however, there are 
a number of significant side effects. In the present study, the 
rats were treated with melatonin and CsA, which effectively 
suppressed the activity of the adaptive immune response, 
including the release of IL‑2 and TNF‑α in serum, which was 
consistent with previous studies (13,19). The protein levels 
of p‑p65 and IL‑1β also markedly declined. Several studies 
have demonstrated that melatonin increases the production of 
TNF‑α (20). The discrepancy may be as a result of the dose of 
melatonin or the experimental model used.
Apoptosis is the process of programmed cell death distinct 
from necrosis (21,22). Apoptotic myocytes are mainly localized 
adjacent to areas of inflammatory infiltration (23,24), so the 
coercion of apoptosis protects the cardiac myocytes. The results 
indicated that melatonin was able to reduce the number of apop￾totic myocytes and the upregulation of Bcl‑2. The combination 
of melatonin and CsA had an additive effect, which provided an 
effective approach to alleviate the proinflammatory state associ￾ated with acute graft rejection.
