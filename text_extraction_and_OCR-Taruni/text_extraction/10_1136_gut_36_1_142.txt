Hepatic venous outflow obstruction in patients
with polycystic liver disease: pathogenesis and
treatment
W Uddin, J K Ramage, B Portmann, P Wilson, I Benjamin, K-C Tan, Roger Williams
Abstract
Polycystic liver disease is commonly
asymptomatic but may present with
hepatomegaly, abdominal distension, and
dull abdominal pain. Transudative ascites
is a rare manifestation in these patients but
may occur when portal hypertension is
present resulting from associated hepatic
fibrosis or after deroofing procedure of
a cyst. Exudative ascites might suggest
hepatic venous outflow obstruction. Four
cases are described where hepatic venous
outflow obstruction occurred in patients
with polycystic liver disease. Three
patients had orthotopic liver transplanta￾tion and one had a mesocaval shunt. Ofthe
two patients that survived orthotopic liver
transplantation both have shown consider￾able improvement in their symptoms.
None of the patients had any confirmed
procoagulant disorder. The mechanism of
hepatic venous outflow obstruction in these
patients seems to be mechanical compres￾sion of hepatic veins by the cysts and
associated formation of thrombi in small
hepatic vein tributaries. Patients with
severe polycystic kidney/liver disease are at
risk of hepatic venous outflow obstruction
and the onset of this complication is
heralded by tender hepatomegaly and
presence of exudative ascites.

ranges from 1 in 200 to 1 in 1000 in different
populations. Liver cysts represent the most
frequent extra renal manifestation of auto￾somal dominant polycystic kidney disease. The
incidence of liver polycystosis in these patients
ranges from 1 5-40%.2 This incidence
increases with age, reaching a frequency of
65% in patients above 60 years of age.34
Symptoms caused by the polycystic liver
become manifest in only 10-1 5% of patients,
but the percentage is rising with the prolonged
survival of patients receiving renal replacement
treatment.
Most patients with liver polycystic disease
present with a dull aching abdominal pain,
but jaundice (which may be caused by an
associated cholangiocarcinoma) and severe
abdominal pain are also important presenting
symptoms.5 Ascites is uncommon and is
usually seen late in the disease.6 When present,
it is usually transudative and is caused by
portal hypertension related to associated
hepatic fibrosis. Occasionally a ruptured cyst
may also present as ascites, which again has
characteristics of a transudate.
Finding exudative ascites in patients with
polycystic liver/kidney disease has to date
implied a second disorder. We describe
four cases of autosomal dominant polycystic
kidney/liver disease who presented with
exudative ascites, in whom the mechanism
was shown to be hepatic venous outflow
obstruction caused by compression of the
hepatic veins leading to thrombotic occlusion
of small hepatic vein branches.
Case histories
CASE 1
A 51 year old woman, was referred with
massive ascites and gross pedal oedema. She
had been diagnosed as having polycystic
kidney/liver disease 25 years ago and needed
P blockers for control of hypertension. Four
years previously she had developed ascites,
which had become progressively worse. For
the past six months she had been greatly
incapacitated by massive ascites and oedema of
the feet. She was confined to a wheel chair, was
breathless on minimum exertion, could not lie
flat in bed, and could only manage a few steps

on her own. Investigations showed: haemo￾globin 9.9 g/dl, white cell count 9.1x109/l,
platelets 31OX109/l. The Table shows the
results of the liver function tests. Serum
electrolytes were normal but creatinine
was raised to 199 pumolI1. Twenty four
hour urinary protein was normal. The ascitic
protein content was 36 g/l; cytology and
microbiological investigations were negative.
Ultrasound and computed tomography of
the abdomen showed a very large liver with
multiple cysts varying in size from a few
millimetres to 6 cm. Aortoportography showed
a normal portal vein. Hepatic venography
showed that the hepatic veins were grossly
distorted with multiple collaterals, changes
consistent with hepatic venous outflow
obstruction.
She had an orthotopic liver transplantation
in January 1993 and at operation 17 litres
of ascitic fluid was drained and the liver
weighed 8.9 kg. The patient has done well
after her transplant. She is ambulatory
with considerable improvement in her
quality of life. Although there has been some
reaccumulation of transudative ascites
(protein 21 g/l), this is easily controlled with
diuretics.
CASE 2
A 47 year old woman with a seven year history
of asymptomatic polycystic disease of the liver
and kidney was referred to the gynaecology
department because of ascites and a uterine
mass. Investigations showed haemoglobin
10.1 g/dl, white cell count 56 X 1 09/1, platelets
289 X 109/1. The urea, liver functions tests, and
electrolytes were normal and plasma albumin
was 44 g/l. Ascitic protein content was 58 g/l
and microbiological and cytology investiga￾tions were negative. Ultrasound and computed
tomography confirmed a uterine mass
with inconclusive fibroid like features. After
hysterectomy she was well for one month
before ascites recurred.
On examination a cystic liver was easily
palpable below the umbilicus. Ascitic protein
content was again high at 56 g/l. Ultrasound
and Doppler studies showed a patent portal
vein but the left hepatic vein was occluded.
Hepatic venography confirmed occlusion of
the left hepatic vein. Evaluation for a hyper￾coagulable state showed that the antithrombin
III, cardiolipin antibody, protein C and S,
Ham's test, and clot lysis test were all normal.
Marrow aspirate was normal and culture
showed no excess of megakaryocyte colonies.
Reaccumulation of ascites required repeated
paracenteses and she therefore had an
orthotopic liver transplantation. During the
reperfusion phase of the operation she
developed severe hypotension from which she
could not be resuscitated. The removed
polycystic liver weighed 5.9 kg.
CASE 3
A 42 year old woman diagnosed as having
polycystic kidney/liver disease 12 years
previously was referred for transplant
assessment because of resistant ascites. She
had been well except for occasional mild
pain in the right upper quadrant until
September 1992, when she rapidly developed
ascites and gross pedal oedema, which
was resistant to high dose diuretics.
On physical examination the liver was
enlarged to 10 cm below the costal margin, but
the kidneys were not palpable because of
very tense ascites. Ultrasound confirmed the
findings of an enlarged liver with multiple cysts
varying in size from a few millimetres to 5 cm.
The kidneys were also enlarged with multiple
cysts. Investigations showed haemoglobin 11.5
g/dl, white cell count 6*7 X 109/1, platelets
185X 109/1. Creatinine was 168 RumolI, but
24 hour urinary protein excretion was
normal. Ascitic fluid protein content was
42 g/l with a negative microbiology and
cytology examination.
A hepatic venogram showed grossly
distorted hepatic veins with multiple collaterals
consistent with hepatic venous outflow
obstruction (Figure 1A). The patient had an
orthotopic liver transplantation. The removed
liver weighed 7.7 kg and macroscopic
examination showed multiple cysts varying
from a few millimetres to 8 cm in size.
The patient had an uneventful post
transplant course and although she continues
to have some ascites it requires only low
dose diuretic treatment for control. The
ascites is now transudative with protein
content of 16 g/l.
CASE 4
A 52 year old woman was referred to the local
hospital by her general practitioner in April
1991 when she suddenly developed severe pain

in her right abdomen. Ultrasound showed
multiple cysts in the liver and a few cysts in
both kidneys. Between April 1991 and July
1992 she required three liver cyst aspirations,
necessitated by pain. In July 1992 one of the
large hepatic cysts was deroofed. Within two
weeks of surgery she was admitted again with
acute onset of abdominal distension and
transient confusion. On examination she was
found to have ascites for the first time.
Investigations showed haemoglobin 12 g/dl,
white cell count 9-2 X 109/1, platelets
213 X 109/l. The urea, electrolytes, and liver
function tests were normal with a plasma
albumin of 40 g/l. Ascitic fluid protein content
was 40 g/l, with negative microbiology and
cytology. The patient improved during her
hospital stay and remained well until
December 1992 when the ascites reappeared.
Her diuretic dose was increased resulting in
some improvement. She was admitted again in
February 1993 with painful and tender
hepatomegaly. Ultrasound and computed
tomography showed an enlarged left lobe and a
considerably enlarged caudate, the right lobe
showing a few small cysts (Fig 1B). Doppler
ultrasound showed that the portal vein was
patent with normal flow. The right and
middle hepatic veins were occluded and left
hepatic vein, although distorted, was patent on
hepatic venography. All haematological and
biochemical investigations were normal.
Investigations for procoagulant states showed a
normal antithrombin III, and protein C and S.
Plasminogen values were also normal.
Autologous erythroid cultures in erythro￾poietin poor media were negative. The patient
successfully had a mesocaval shunt, with
lowering of portal venous pressure and relief of
symptoms of the grossly enlarged caudate lobe,
and is at present asymptomatic while receiving
a small dose of diuretics.
Pathological examination
The livers removed at transplantation in cases
1 to 3 weighed respectively 8-9 kg, 5 9 kg, and
7.7 kg and were similar on gross examination.
Their surface was considerably distorted by
numerous protruding cysts, which on the
cut section were diffusely distributed and
extensively replaced the liver parenchyma.
Their sizes ranged from a few millimetres to
8 cm in maximum diameter. They variably
contained serous fluid, yellow or lightly bile
stained jelly like material, or altered blood. The
amount of intervening parenchyma ranged
from inconspicuous to sleeves of tissues up to
5 cm in thickness. There were broad areas
showing red haemorrhagic mottling, some as
large as a liver segment, though a precise
distribution could not be identified because of
the complete obliteration of the liver anatomy
by the cysts. Appearances were those of
localised Budd-Chiari. The less affected
parenchyma exhibited a slight nodularity
suggesting regenerative hyperplasia. The main
branches of the hepatic veins were free from
thrombosis, though they were considerably
distorted, seemingly compressed in between
or stretched at the periphery of major cysts
(Fig 2).
Histologically, most of the cysts were
lined by flattened biliary epithelium. Scattered
biliary hamartomas (von Meyenburg
complexes) were present in the intervening
parenchyma, their lumens being filled with
inspissated bile. There were extensive areas of
sinusoidal dilatation and congestion associated
with hepatocyte loss affecting the whole of
acinar zones 2 and 3, and to a lesser extent and
focally zone 1. Appearances were typical of
venous outflow block (Fig 3). In these areas,
small supralobular branches of the hepatic vein
had their lumens narrowed or occluded by
loose fibrous tissue containing entrapped red
cells and neolumens in keeping with organised
thrombi.
Discussion
Polycystic liver disease is thought to be caused
by a failure of excess intralobular bile ducts to
involute during embryonic development.7-8
The disease is genetically determined with an
autosomal dominant mode of inheritance.
Associated polycystic kidney disease is often
present. Most patients with liver polycystic
disease remain asymptomatic. Abdominal
pain and distension are common presenting
complaints in symptomatic patients and are
caused by the enlarging liver. Ascites is the
most common clinical manifestation of hepatic
venous outflow block, being present in

Hepatic venous outflow obstruction in patients with polycystic liver disease: pathogenesis and treatment 145
90-96%9 of patients. Abdominal pain and
tender hepatomegaly are also common. Ascitic
fluid has a high protein content, which most
probably results from the high permeability
to proteins of the sinusoidal walls. Increased
sinusoidal pressure enhances the filtration
of interstitial fluid and when drainage capacity
of hepatic lymphatics is exceeded, filtration of
fluid through the liver capsules occurs.
Most patients with polycystic liver disease
do not require any treatment. Active treatment
should be considered only when patients
become symptomatic or develop complications
secondary to cysts. Uncomplicated but
symptomatic polycystic liver disease requires
treatment that varies from simple aspiration of
the cyst to deroofing of the cyst, partial hepatic
resection or orthotopic liver transplantation.
The choice of procedure depends on the
number and size of the cysts, severity of
symptoms, degree of portal hypertension, and
underlying hepatic function. 10 Patients who
develop complications secondary to cysts
more commonly require active treatment.
Hepatic venous outflow obstruction secondary
to liver polycystosis can be treated initially
with diuretics and oral anticoagulants.
Anticoagulation should be used very cautiously
because of the association of this condition
with intracranial berry aneurysms. Porto￾systemic shunting remains a good option
assuming that hepatic venous outflow obstruc￾tion is not long standing, and that patients
have reasonable synthetic liver function.
When patients have severe symptoms from
huge liver cysts and resistant ascites, or have
longstanding venous outflow block with poor
liver function, orthotopic liver transplantation
is the only logical choice.
It is unlikely that all patients with multiple
large liver cysts need longterm anticoagulation
treatment to prevent the uncommon complica￾tion of hepatic venous outflow obstruction,
especially as there is an association of intra￾cranial berry aneurysms with polycystic disease.
Orthotopic liver transplantation seems to be a
successful treatment option in patients with
polycystic liver disease and hepatic venous out￾flow obstruction and the role of the mesocaval
shunt remains unproved. We describe here four
cases of hepatic venous outflow obstruction in
polycystic liver disease (one of which, case 2,
has been reported before' 1). Three of the cases
had an orthotopic liver transplant and in these
cases the hepatic veins were clearly distorted by
the large cysts. In case 4 the cysts were smaller
and mainly confined to the right lobe. As the
liver has not been removed, it cannot be proved
that the cysts caused hepatic vein compression
in this case. No procoagulant state was identi￾fied, however, and the vein occlusion was of the
right vein (in the area where cysts were present)
and it is probable that the cystic disease and
venous occlusion were related. These cases
show the different ways in which the condition
can present and give a clearer picture of the
pathogenesis and treatment of this unusual
syndrome.
