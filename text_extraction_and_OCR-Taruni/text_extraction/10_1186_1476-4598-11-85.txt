Abstract
Background:
Due to the frequent dysregulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, mTOR represents a suitable
therapeutic target in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, emerging data from clinical trials of HCC patients
indicate that mTOR inhibition by RAD001 (Everolimus) alone has only moderate antitumor efficacy which may be
due to the feedback activation of AKT after mTOR inhibition. In this study, we analyzed the effects of dual inhibition
of mTOR and AKT on the proliferation of HCC cell lines. In addition, we measured the feedback activation of each
of the AKT isoforms after mTOR inhibition in HCC cell lines and their enzymatic activity in primary samples from
HCC patients.
Methods:
The activation status of specific AKT isoforms in human HCC samples and corresponding healthy liver tissue was
analyzed using an AKT isoform specific in vitro kinase assay. AKT isoform activation after mTOR inhibition was
analyzed in three HCC cell lines (Hep3B, HepG2 and Huh7), and the impact of AKT signaling on proliferation after
mTOR inhibition was investigated using the novel AKT inhibitor MK-2206 and AKT isoform specific knockdown cells.
Results:
AKT isoforms become differentially activated during feedback activation following RAD001 treatment. The
combination of mTOR inhibition and AKT isoform knockdown showed only a weak synergistic effect on
proliferation of HCC cell lines. However, the combinatorial treatment with RAD001 and the pan AKT inhibitor
MK-2206 resulted in a strong synergism, both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, by analyzing primary HCC tissue
samples we were able to demonstrate that a hotspot mutation (H1047R) of PI3KCA, the gene encoding the
catalytic subunit of PI3K, was associated with increased in vitro kinase activity of all AKT isoforms in comparison to
healthy liver tissue of the patient.
Conclusion:
Our results demonstrate that dual targeting of mTOR and AKT by use of RAD001 and the pan AKT inhibitor
MK-2206 does effectively inhibit proliferation of HCC cell lines. These data suggest that combined treatment with
RAD001 and MK-2206 may be a promising therapy approach in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.

Background
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause
of cancer mortality worldwide, with an increasing inci￾dence in the United States and Europe [1,2]. Only 30-40%
of patients are amenable to potentially curative therapies,
such as surgical resection, because of the often advanced
stage of disease at the time of diagnosis. Today, the multi￾kinase inhibitor sorafenib is the only systemic therapy to
improve survival in these patients [3]. However, prognosis
of advanced HCC remains poor, and new effective thera￾peutic strategies are urgently needed.
The PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway is a promising
target with respect to its frequent dysregulation in hepato￾cellular carcinoma and its central role in regulating cell
proliferation, migration, survival and angiogenesis [4,5]. Ab￾errant mTOR signaling has been detected in up to 48% of
hepatocellular carcinoma, and a correlation between poor
outcome and mTOR signaling activation has been shown
[6]. Phosphorylation of AKT at S473 was detected in up to
71% of HCC samples, and associated with invasion, metas￾tasis, and vascularization of HCC [7].
Several inhibitors targeting mTOR are tested in clinical
trials at present [8]. Clinical trials revealed that the rapa￾mycin derivative RAD001 (Everolimus) is sufficient to im￾prove the overall survival of patients with metastatic renal
carcinoma and subependymal giant cell astrocytoma
[9,10]. Emerging data from clinical trials of HCC patients
indicate that RAD001, even well tolerated, has only mod￾erate antitumor efficacy in HCC patients [11,12]. A nega￾tive feedback loop resulting in the activation of AKT
following mTOR inhibition has been observed in a variety
of cancer cell lines and human tumor samples of colon
and breast cancer [13]. Since the antitumor efficacy of
rapalogues in patients is modest, activation of AKT as a
central regulator of cell growth is a potentially unfavorable
event resulting from cancer treatment with mTOR inhibi￾tors [14]. AKT feedback is thought to be mediated by in￾hibition of p70S6 kinase activity, resulting in an increase
in IRS-1 (insulin receptor substrate 1) expression [15].
Since it has been demonstrated that cells lacking IRS-1
also show increased AKT phosphorylation following
mTOR inhibition, other mechanisms of feedback activa￾tion have been proposed [16]. An increase in the
phosphorylation of receptor tyrosine kinases, i.e. EGFR,
HER2, HER3 among others, following treatment with
rapamycin was demonstrated [17] and may represent an
IRS-1-independent way of increased AKT signaling.
The serine/threonine kinase AKT is a key player of the
regulatory network of the cell and affects virtually all cellu￾lar activities, including growth, survival, movement, differ￾entiation and metabolism [18,19]. Currently, three
mammalian isoforms of AKT (AKT1/PKBα, AKT2/PKBβ,
and AKT3/PKBγ) have been identified [20,21]. The iso￾forms share a high degree of structural homology with
human AKT1 having 81 and 83% amino acid identity with
AKT2 and AKT3, respectively. Although there is evidence
for partial functional overlap of the AKT isoforms, studies
on isoform specific knockout mice revealed their distinct
functional roles underlined by diverse signaling cascades,
thereby controlling cell growth, metabolism, cell prolifera￾tion and survival [22,23]. Specific functions of each isoform
have also been proposed in human carcinoma cell lines and
mouse models [24-26].
In this study, we analyzed the AKT feedback activation
following RAD001 treatment in three HCC cell lines with
different AKT isoform expression levels. For the first time
differential changes in AKT isoform activity following
RAD001 treatment were documented.
Furthermore, the importance of AKT isoform specific sig￾naling following mTOR inhibition has been investigated
by combination of the mTOR inhibitor RAD001 either
with the new orally active allosteric pan AKT inhibitor
MK-2206 [27], or AKT isoform specific knockdown cells.
Here, we demonstrate that inhibition of mTOR and AKT
in combination acts synergistically on cell proliferation of
HCC cells. Our results suggest that dual targeting of
mTOR and AKT might be a new promising therapeutic
approach in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.
Results
Feedback activation of AKT following mTOR inhibition
with RAD001 is concentration- and time-dependent
In order to investigate feedback activation of AKT follow￾ing mTOR inhibition we analyzed the activation of the
PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in the three HCC cell lines
Hep3B, HepG2 and Huh7. All HCC cell lines showed a
constitutive activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
as demonstrated by phosphorylation of AKT (S473 and
T308), mTOR (S2448), representing mTORC1 activity
[28], and pS6 (S240/S244) which is a downstream sub￾strate of mTORC1 and S6-kinase (Figure 1A). Treatment
of the HCC cell lines with various concentrations of
RAD001 resulted in a marked suppression of phosphoryl￾ation of mTOR (S2448) and the downstream S6 protein
(S240/244) (Figure 1A). Interestingly, we observed a differ￾ential feedback activation of AKT in a concentration￾dependent manner after treatment with RAD001 for
24 hours with respect to phosphorylation of AKT at resi￾dues S473 versus T308 (1B). The feedback phosphory￾lation at S473 showed a peak level at 1 nM (Hep3B and
Huh7) and only a lower or even no increase at all at higher
concentrations of RAD001. In contrast, feedback phos￾phorylation of T308 was observed at low and high concen￾trations of RAD001 (Figure 1A, B).
Because we did not observe an increase in the phosphor￾ylation of AKT at S473 in HCC cells after treatment with a
higher concentration of 100 nM RAD001 at 24 hours
(Figure 1B), we performed a more detailed time kinetic

from 3 up to 72 hour (Figure 1C and D, Additional file 1:
Figure S1). No significant time dependent change in pAKT
(S473) expression was observed in Hep3B cells at 100 nM
RAD001 (Additional file 1: Figure S1). Surprisingly, a short
term increase of pAKT (S473) expression was evident in
both Huh7 (Figure 1C) and HepG2 (Figure 1D) cells with a
peak between 3 to 12 h after treatment with RAD001. The
basal pAKT (S473) expression level was reestablished after
24 h and no further increase was observed at 48 h post￾treatment. The decrease of pAKT (S473) represents

inhibition of mTORC2 activity [29]. This is in line with
previous studies showing suppressed mTORC2 assembly
after prolonged incubation of cells with allosteric mTOR
inhibitors [30]. In the case that the culture medium was
replaced after 48 h with medium containing fresh RAD001,
subsequent AKT feedback phosphorylation on S473 was
absent or only weakly detectable 3 to 6 h after the addition
of new RAD001 (Figure 1C and D). Conversely, there was
a clear time-dependent increase in pAKT (T308), reaching
its maximum after >30 h of incubation. While cells treated
one time only with RAD001 show elevated levels of pAKT
(S473) after 60 and 72 h, no increase of pAKT (S473) ex￾pression was observed after 60 and 72 h in cells re-treated
with fresh culture medium after 48 h (Figure 1C and 1D).
This late increase in pAKT (S473) might be due to deg￾radation of RAD001 in culture medium, thereby pos￾sibly relieving mTORC2 complexes of RAD001-
mediated inhibition which was described before [31].
All results were confirmed in at least two independent
experiments.
Differential and isoform specific activation of AKT1, AKT2
and AKT3 during feedback activation after mTOR
inhibition
The regulation of AKT kinase activity involves phos￾phorylation of threonine residue 308 in the activation
loop and serine residue 473 in the hydrophobic region
[32,33]. Of note, phospho-specific AKT antibodies
directed against S473 and T308 used here and in nu￾merous other publications do not discriminate between
the different AKT isoforms. Therefore, the representa￾tion of single AKT isoform activities measured by the
expression of pAKT (S473) or (T308) with phospho￾AKT specific antibodies remains unclear. A more
detailed insight into the regulation of AKT isoforms
may be interesting in the term of developing of AKT
isoform specific inhibitors as anticancer drugs. To
assess whether a specific AKT isoform becomes pre￾dominantly activated after RAD001 treatment, we first
analyzed the expression of AKT isoforms in HCC cell
lines. As shown in Figure 2A, all cell lines expressed
AKT1 and AKT2, with the highest expression levels
observed in Huh7 cells (Figure 2A). In contrast, AKT3
expression was restricted to Hep3B cells.
To reveal changes in AKT activity, an AKT isoform￾specific, quantitative in vitro kinase assay was performed
as described previously [24], using the same cell lysates as
shown in Figure 1A. Since AKT3 was not detectable in
HepG2 and Huh7 cells either by western blot or by immu￾noprecipitation technique using different AKT3 antibodies,
we analyzed AKT3 kinase activity only in Hep3B cells.
Interestingly, we observed a differential concentration￾dependent pattern of AKT-isoform activation following
RAD001 treatment for the three HCC cell lines analyzed.
Hep3B cells showed a moderate increase in AKT2 activity,
but no increase in AKT1 and AKT3 activity (Figure 2B).
The increase in AKT2 activity was only observed at 1nM
RAD001 but not at higher concentrations. In contrast, in
HepG2 cells we observed an increase in AKT1 activity at
all concentrations analyzed, whereas AKT2 kinase activity
was decreased in a concentration-dependent manner. In
Huh7 cells, RAD001 led to a 40- and 20-fold increase in
AKT1 and AKT2 kinase activity after stimulation with
1 nM RAD001, respectively. Interestingly, a similar activa￾tion of both AKT isoforms was also observed after stimula￾tion of these cells with the higher concentration of 10 and
100 nM RAD001 (Figure 2B) [34].
Dual targeting of mTOR and AKT highly synergistically
inhibits proliferation of HCC cell lines
We next aimed to investigate the impact of AKT activity
after RAD001 treatment. By use of MK-2206, a new highly
potent allosteric pan-AKT inhibitor, we analyzed dual tar￾geting of mTOR and AKT on proliferation of HCC cells.
As shown in Figure 3A, AKT inhibitor MK-2206 reduced
the phosphorylation of pAKT (S473) and (T308) in all
HCC cell lines, with no preference for either phosphoryl￾ation site. Concomitant with the reduction in pAKT was a
moderate reduction in phosphorylation of GSK3β at S9
and S6 at S235/246, albeit to a varying degree among the
analyzed cell lines. To evaluate a potential synergistic
effect of combined inhibition of mTOR and AKT, we used
the method proposed by Chou and Talalay [35]. HCC cell
lines were treated with RAD001, MK-2206, or a combin￾ation of both compounds with a fixed ratio of 1:5, over a
broad range of clinically relevant concentrations. To
exclude effects of plating density on proliferation, we
established ideal plating densities for each cell line
(See figure on previous page.)

Where indicated, medium was removed after 48 h and replaced by fresh, 100 nM RAD001 containing medium. HSC70 served as loading control.

(Additional file 2: Figure S2). The importance of this step
was underlined by a marked reduction of proliferation for
cells reaching >80% confluence.
Treatment with RAD001 over 72 h resulted in a signifi￾cant decrease in proliferation of all cell lines, with HepG2
cells being least, and Huh7 being most sensitive to
RAD001 (Figure 3B).In contrast to Huh7 and Hep3B,
HepG2 cells harbor a mutation in N-ras (http://rcgdb.
bioinf.uni-sb.de/MutomeWeb) which was discussed to con￾tribute to RAD001 resistance [36]. We observed no signifi￾cant dose dependent effects of RAD001 on proliferation for
the concentrations between 1 nM and 1000 nM with the
exception that HepG2 cells showed a non-significant trend
towards stronger inhibition at higher concentrations of
RAD001.
The anti-proliferative efficacy of AKT inhibitor MK-2206
alone was only weak with IC50 values of 3.7 μM, 7.4 μM
and 3.1 μM for Hep3B, HepG2 and Huh7, respectively
(Additional file 3: Figure S3). However, combining RAD001
and MK-2206 led to a synergistic suppression of prolifera￾tion in all three cell lines, with Combination Index (CI)
values indicating strong, or very strong synergism especially
at moderate and higher concentrations of the two com￾pounds (Figure 3D, Additional file 4: Figure S4). As shown
in Figure 3E combining RAD001 and MK-2206 resulted in
a significantly higher accumulation of cells in G0/G1 phase
compared to each compound alone. An increase of cells in
subG1 phase was present in all cell lines treated with the
combination, indicating the presence of apoptotic cells.
Furthermore, since effects of RAD001 alone on prolifera￾tion were not dose dependent, we next tested whether syn￾ergistic effects were dependent on higher doses of RAD001.
We therefore treated HCC cells with increasing concentra￾tions of RAD001 alone or in combination with a fixed dose
of MK-2206. As shown in Figure 3C, strong synergistic
effects of dual mTOR- and AKT-inhibition could already
be achieved at doses of RAD001 as low as 1 nM. Interest￾ingly, no RAD001 concentration-dependent differences in
the synergistic effect of RAD001 and MK-2206 were
observed, although low doses of RAD001,i.e. 1 nM, resulted
in the strongest increase in phosphorylation of AKT at
S473 (Figure 1A, B) and AKT isoform activity (Figure 2B).
Knockdown of a single AKT isoform is synergistic with
mTOR inhibition on proliferation of HCC cells
To analyze the impact of single AKT isoforms on proli￾feration of HCC cell lines, we generated stable AKT1 and
AKT2 knockdown cells for all three HCC cell lines. Since
we were unable to detect AKT3 at protein level in HepG2
and Huh7 cells, AKT3 knockdown cells were only estab￾lished for Hep3B cells (Figure 4A). Knockdown of AKT iso￾forms was highly effective, and no significant changes in
the expression of the remaining AKT isoforms were
detected as shown for Hep3B cells.
Next we compared the effect of MK-2206 and knock￾down of single AKT isoforms on activation of AKT and
mTOR signaling pathways in HCC cell lines (Figure 4B for
Hep3B cells, Additional file 5: Figure S5 for HepG2 and

Huh7 cells). Treatment with 1.7 μM MK-2206 completely
abolished phosphorylation of AKT and decreased phos￾phorylation of GSK3β at serine residue 9. Knockdown of
AKT2 led to a reduced phosphorylation of AKT at S473and
T308 in all three cell lines, whereas knockdown of AKT1
and AKT3 did not result in reduced levels of phosphory￾lated AKT (Figure 4B, Additional file 5: Figure S5).
To further investigate synergistic effects of combined
mTOR and AKT isoform inhibition, AKT isoform knock￾down cells were treated with 100 nM RAD001 or DMSO
for 24 h. In addition, control cells treated with 1.7 μM MK￾2206 alone or in combination with 100 nM of mTOR in￾hibitor RAD001 were analyzed. As shown in Figure 4C,
knockdown of AKT1 led to a significant inhibition of prolif￾eration of all investigated HCC cell lines, with the strongest
effect observed in Hep3B cells. While depletion of AKT2
reduced proliferation of both, Hep3B and HepG2 cells,
knockdown of AKT3 had no significant effect on prolif￾eration of Hep3B cells. In combination with RAD001
knockdown of AKT1 resulted in a synergistic inhibition of
proliferation of all HCC cell lines, whereas knockdown of
AKT2 was only synergistic in Huh7 cells. Combining
RAD001 with pan AKT inhibitor MK-2206 led to a mark￾edly stronger reduction of cell proliferation than combin￾ing RAD001 with knockdown of any single AKT isoform.
RAD001 and MK-2206 are highly synergistic in vivo
Next, we analyzed the efficacy of dual treatment with
RAD001 and MK-2206 in a subcutaneous HCC xenograft
mouse model. As seen in Figure 5A, combining RAD001
and MK-2206 significantly prolonged survival of mice
compared to placebo or each compound alone. Further￾more, a significant decrease in tumor volume compared to
placebo was only observed in mice treated with the com￾bination of RAD001 and MK-2206 (Figure 5B). Until
15 days post-treatment, no significant difference in mouse
weight was observed between the four groups, indicating
that the treatment was well tolerated. The decrease in the
average weight at day 18 in placebo and MK-2206 treated
mice reflects tumor cachexia due to tumor progression
(Additional file 6: Figure S6). To confirm specific effects of
RAD001 and MK-2206 on PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling,
tumor portions from one randomly chosen mouse per
group were subjected to Western blot analysis. As seen in
Figure 5C, RAD001 almost completely abolished phos￾phorylation of S6 at serine residue 240/244. Treatment
with RAD001 slightly increased the phosphorylation of
AKT at threonine residue 308, whereas treatment with
MK-2206 suppressed the phosphorylation of AKT at both
serine residue 473 and threonine residue 308.
All AKT isoforms are activated in a HCC patient with
mutated PI3K
In order to identify genetic alterations in the PI3K/AKT/
mTOR signaling pathway in liver cancer, genomic DNA
from 10 primary tumor samples of HCC patients were
analysed by direct sequencing after PCR amplification. Yet,
mutations in the regulatory p85α subunit of PI3K, the PH
domain of the three AKT isoforms and specific domains of
mTOR have not been analysed in HCC. The 47 exons of
the sequenced genes PIK3R1 (p85α subunit of PI3K),
PIK3CA (catalytic subunit of PI3K) FRAP1 (mTOR), the
three AKT isoforms (AKT1, AKT2, AKT3) and the genetic
alterations identified within the 10 HCC samples are sum￾marized in Table 1. No genetic alterations have been iden￾tified in AKT1, AKT2 or AKT3. A comparison with the

respectively. (A) Treatment with RAD001 and MK-2206 significantly prolonged survival of tumor bearing mice compared to all other groups
(p < 0.05). (B) Tumor volume was monitored over an 18 day period, presented as mean ± SEM. RAD + MK vs Placebo and RAD + MK vs MK-2206
alone was significant at day 15 (p < 0.05). Note that one mouse had to be withdrawn from the experiment in the RAD001 and MK-2206
treatment group at day 13 and 15 respectively, and two mice were withdrawn from the Placebo group at days 11 and 15. (C) AKT and mTOR
signaling in tumor samples was analyzed by Western blot.

NCBI SNP database revealed that genetic alterations
detected in PIK3R1 and mTOR (FRAP1) are SNPs. One
somatic mutation was identified in PIK3CA encoding the
catalytic subunit of PI3K in tumor sample H292 (exon 20,
3140 a > g; H1047R).
To further gain insight into the state of AKT activation
and signaling in HCC in vivo, tumor samples used for
sequencing have additionally been analysed on protein
level by western blotting (Figure 6A). As expected, we
observed heterogeneous expression profiles of phosphory￾lated AKT. AKT was activated in two out of ten investi￾gated HCC samples, and functional AKT signaling in
these two tumor samples was further confirmed by a con￾comitant phosphorylation of the AKT downstream
ubstrate GSK3β (S9).
The activation status of AKT isoforms was further ana￾lysed by AKT isoform specific in vitro kinase assays. As
shown in Figure 6B, AKT isoform expression does not
correlate with AKT isoform activity, indicating that AKT
isoforms are differentially activated independent of their
expression level in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrated
for the first time that the H1047R mutant in the catalytic
subunit of PI3K led to elevated activity of all AKT iso￾forms in comparison to healthy liver tissue of the patient
(see patient H292, Table 1). These results indicate that all
AKT isoforms become activated by the oncogenic hot spot
H1047R mutant of PI3K in HCC.
Discussion
In this study, we aimed to investigate the PI3K/AKT/
mTOR signaling pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma by
highlighting the feedback activation of AKT and its dis￾tinct isoforms following mTOR inhibition by RAD001.
Further, we analyzed the activation status of specific AKT
isoforms in HCC samples and corresponding healthy liver
tissue as well as their diverse implications in terms of

proliferation of HCC cell lines. In order to draw a light on
genetic alterations of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling in hepa￾tocellular carcinoma, DNA sequencing of human tumor
samples were performed. The molecular events leading to
activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling cascade are
not fully understood. In general, mutations in mTOR are
rare. Two single amino acid substitutions in TOR1 (FRB
domain) have been identified in yeast, exhibiting resis￾tance to caffeine [37]. In addition, a point mutation in
TOR2 (FRB domain) was found leading to a weak rapamy￾cin resistance [38]. On humans, two oncogenic mutations
of mTOR have been reported so far in colorectal and renal
carcinoma [39,40]. Genetic aberrations in AKT itself have
not yet been identified in HCC patients. In contrast, muta￾tions in PIK3CA, the gene encoding for the catalytic subunit
of PI3K, have been described in up to 35% of patients with
HCC [41-43]. Our mutational analysis of ten human HCCs
revealed no genetic alteration in mTOR or in any of the
AKT isoforms. One somatic “hot spot” mutation of PI3K
was detected in the gene PIK3CA (exon 20, 3140 a > g
[H1047R]). Moreover, we analyzed the expression and ac￾tivity of AKT isoforms in these tumor samples. Although
all AKT isoforms were expressed in HCC samples, results
revealed that AKT activity is often confined to particular
AKT isoforms and independent of AKT isoform expres￾sion. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that
the oncogenic and well characterized H1047R mutant of
PIK3CA, leading to constitutive activation of PI3K [44],
results in elevated activity of all three AKT isoforms in
comparison to healthy liver tissue of this patient. These
data indicate that all AKT isoforms become activated by
mutant PI3K (H1047R) in HCC. Whether all AKT isoforms
are involved in the oncogenic signalling has to be shown in
further experiments.
Our data further demonstrate that combining mTOR
inhibitor RAD001 and AKT inhibitor MK-2206 shows a
strong synergistic effect on the proliferation of HCC cell
in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, dual targeting of AKT and
mTOR might be a promising treatment option for HCC
patients. Moreover, we give new insight into AKT isoform
specific kinase activity and signaling after mTOR inhib￾ition in HCC cells. Increased AKT1 kinase activity follow￾ing mTOR treatment was reported before in HeLa cells
[30]. However, AKT2 and AKT3 kinase activity has not
been investigated. Our data demonstrate that single AKT
isoforms can be differentially regulated after mTOR inhib￾ition, as shown for HepG2 cells. Therefore, analysis of all
AKT isoforms is necessary to understand the complex
mechanism of AKT signaling. Overall, we demonstrated
that a high expression level of phosphorylated AKT
induced by feedback activation following mTOR inhib￾ition can actually represent increased kinase activity of dif￾ferent AKT isoforms. The clinical relevance of this finding
is underscored by the fact that increased AKT
phosphorylation was recently observed in a significant pro￾portion of tumor samples obtained from patients treated
with RAD001 [45]. Which AKT isoforms become activated
in patients treated with RAD001 has to be analyzed in fur￾ther experiments.
In this study, we showed that knockdown of a single
AKT isoform had only a minor effect on proliferation of
HCC cells, with the most dominant effect observed for
AKT1 in Hep3B cells. Although specific functions of AKT
isoforms have clearly been demonstrated [26,46], compen￾sation and redundancy among AKT isoforms might limit
the efficacy of AKT isoform specific inhibitors. However,
further research is necessary to understand the exact effect
of single AKT isoform inhibition on function and activity
of remaining AKT isoforms.
Functional analysis of AKT isoforms of different tumor
entities revealed specific oncogenic functions for distinct
AKT isoforms [47]. Conclusively, the group of Muller
demonstrated that AKT1 induced tumor growth, while
AKT2 promotes metastasis of ErbB2-induced breast can￾cer in vivo [48]. Taking together these results suggest that
cancer patients would profit more of a pan AKT inhibitor
than of AKT isoform specific inhibitors. Consequently, in￾hibition of mTOR by RAD001 in combination with
knockdown of a single AKT isoform evoked only small
synergistic effects on proliferation of HCC cells and was
additionally not restricted to a single AKT isoform as
shown for Huh7 cells. In order to investigate dual target￾ing of mTOR and total AKT, we analyzed the efficacy of
combination of mTOR inhibitor RAD001 with the potent
pan AKT inhibitor MK-2206. In contrast to single AKT
isoform knockdowns, treatment with pan AKT inhibitor
MK-2206 in combination with RAD001 led to a signifi￾cant, highly synergistic reduction of cell proliferation of all
HCC cell lines tested. These data suggest that the inhib￾ition of all AKT isoforms using a pan AKT inhibitor like
MK-2206 is necessary to achieve profound synergistic
effects in combination with the mTOR inhibitor RAD001.
Highlighting the dual targeting of mTOR and AKT as an
efficient therapy approach of HCC is of great clinical
interest, since MK-2206 is already being tested in clinical
trials and reported to be well tolerated [49,50].
Conclusion
In summary, our data demonstrate that dual targeting of
mTOR and AKT led to synergistic inhibition of prolifera￾tion of HCC cell lines. Further, our results suggest that
inhibition of all, rather than one specific AKT isoform is
necessary to achieve bold synergistic effects on cell pro￾liferation. In conclusion, the combination of mTOR in￾hibitor RAD001 and pan AKT inhibitor MK-2206 might
represent a new promising treatment strategy for patients
with advanced HCC.

Methods
Materials
RAD001 was provided by Novartis (Basel, Switzerland).
MK-2206 was obtained from Selleck Chemicals (Houston,
TX, USA). Stock solutions with a concentration of 10 mM
were prepared and stored at −80°C. All RAD001 solutions
were thawed and refrozen for a maximum of three times
and then discarded. Antibodies against pan AKT, AKT1,
AKT2, pAKT (S473), pAKT (T308), mTOR, pmTOR
(S2448), pmTOR (S2481), Raptor, Rictor, pERK (T202/
204), ERK, pS6 (S240/244), IRS-1 and pIRS-1 (S636/639)
were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers,
MA). Antibodies against AKT2 and HSC-70 were pur￾chased from Santa Cruz. AKT3 antibody was obtained
from Millipore (Schwallbach, Germany). 7-AAD was
obtained from BD Biosciences (Pharmingen, CA, USA).
Cell culture
The three hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines Hep3B,
HepG2 and Huh-7 were a kind gift from Prof. Dr. H. Will
at the Heinrich Pette Institute, Hamburg, Germany. All cell
lines were maintained in DMEM, supplemented with 10%
(v/v) FCS, and 1% (v/v) penicillin and streptomycin. Cells
were cultured at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere contain￾ing 5% CO2. All cells were tested for mycoplasma contam￾ination every 2–3 months.
Western Blot analysis
Western blot analysis was performed as described previ￾ously [24]. Protein expression was quantified using an LAS￾3000 Imager from Fuji (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany).
Lentiviral knockdown of AKT isoforms
pLKO.1-puro vector encoding either AKT1, AKT2, AKT3
or scrambled shRNA were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(Taufkirchen, Germany). Generation of pseudotype lenti￾viruses and transduction were performed as previously
described [24]. Transduced cells were selected by addition
of puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany) to
culture medium (final concentration 1.5 μg/ml) for at least
two weeks before experiments were carried out.
Proliferation and cell cycle assay
Proliferation was analyzed either by flow cytometry using
the BrdU APC Flow Kit (BD, Pharmingen, CA, USA) or
with the colorimetric BrdU ELISA Kit (RocheW, Basel,
CH) as indicated in the figure legends. For FACS-based
assays, cells were seeded into 10 cm dishes and allowed to
attach overnight. Then, medium was replaced by medium
containing RAD001, MK-2206, a combination of both, or
DMSO as control. Final DMSO concentration in culture
medium was 0.1% (v/v) in all experiments. For labeling
BrdU (final concentration 10 μM) was added and cells
were incubated for 12 to 16 h. For cell cycle analysis, cells
were fixed in ice cold 70% ethanol for at least 6 h, washed
and subsequently incubated with 5 μg 7-AAD and 5 μg
RNAse A for one hour. Each experiment was performed
in triplicates and has been repeated at least one time.
Analysis was performed on BD Canto II flow cytometer
(BD Pharmingen, CA, USA). Cell cycle analysis was per￾formed using FlowJo 7.6.5 software.
For BrdU ELISA assays, cells were seeded into 96-well
plates and allowed to attach overnight. Cells were then
incubated for 72 h with different concentrations of MK￾2206, RAD001, or a combination of both. Controls were
treated with DMSO only. BrdU ELISA was performed as
described by the manufacturer (Becton Dickenson,
Heidelberg, Germany). Each experiment was repeated at
least three times in quadruplicates.
Immunoprecipitation and AKT isoform specific in vitro
kinase assay
Immunoprecipitation of AKT isoforms and subsequent
in vitro kinase assay was performed as described before
[24]. Whole samples were analyzed by western blot tech￾nique probed with pGSK3α/ß (S9/21) and panAKT anti￾body. Subsequently,nitrocellulose membrane was incubated
with secondary goat anti-mouse antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, CA, USA) to detect mouse IgG levels for
sample correction.
Primary human HCC samples
The human investigations were performed according to
the Declaration of Helsinki after approval was obtained by
the local ethics committee of the Medical Association
Hamburg. From all patients, written informed consent was
obtained prior to study related procedures. Tumor samples
and samples of corresponding healthy liver tissue of HCC
patients treated at the University Medical Center Hamburg
Eppendorf, Department of Hepatobiliary and Transplant
Surgery were stored at Indivumed (Hamburg, Germany)
following the Indivumed Standard of Biobanking
(http://www.indivumed.com). Genomic DNA isolation and
sequence analysis was performed by Inostics (Hamburg,
Germany). For protein analysis and kinase assays tis￾sue samples were lysed by homogenisation of samples with
Lysis Matrix-D (MP, USA) in NP-40 lysis buffer (contain￾ing: 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 2%
aprotinin, 2 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaF, 10 mM NaPPi, 10%
glycin, 1 mM vanadate and 1 mM PMSF) with the tissue
lyser MX Pro (MP, USA).
Mutation analysis of PI3K, AKT and mTOR in HCC samples
Sequence analysis of genes from 10 HCC samples encod￾ing the p85α adapter subunit of PI3K (exon 9–17 of
PIK3RI), the p110α catalytic subunit of PI3Kα (exon 2 and
10–21 of PIK3CA), mTOR (exon 44–57 of FRAP1), AKT1
(exon 3–6), AKT2 (exon 2–5) or AKT3 (exon 1–3) were

performed by amplification of the exons with primers
located in the neighboring introns by PCR and sequenced
using BigDye Terminator 3.1 according to the instructions
by the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems). Primer sequences
can be found in Additional file 7: Table S1.
Animal experiments
All experimental protocols were approved by local author￾ities (Ministry of Health and Consumer Protection,
Hamburg, Germany, Permit Number G52/11). 2x10^6
Huh7 cells were injected subcutaneously into SCID mice
(female, age 8 weeks, n = 7 per group, obtained from
Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany). Upon establishment of
palpable tumours after three weeks, mice were randomly
assigned to one of the four groups (Placebo, RAD001,
MK-2206, or RAD001 and MK-2206), and treatment was
started. Tumor growth was monitored by regular visual
inspection and tumor dimensions were measured every
2–3 days. Tumor volume was calculated using the formula
longest tumor diameter x (shortest tumor diameter)^2/2.
RAD001, formulated as a microemulsion, was dosed at
1 mg/kg body weight and administered daily Monday
through Friday. MK-2206 was formulated in a 30% (w/v)
Captisol solution and administered Monday, Wednesday
and Friday dosed at 100 mg/kg. A placebo microemulsion
(provided by Novartis) and a 30% (w/v) Captisol solution
served as placebo. The compounds were mixed immedi￾ately before administered by gavage in a total volume of
100 μl. Animals were treated until termination criteria
(tumor ulceration, tumor size > 2 cm in largest diameter,
loss of body weight exceeding 20%) were met, or for a
maximum of 22 days when all mice in the placebo group
had to be withdrawn. Xenograft primary tumours were
harvested at necropsy and a portion of each tumor was
snap frozen on liquid nitrogen for Western Blot analysis.
Statistical analysis
Student’s t-Test (unpaired, 2-tailed) was calculated based
on the data of at least three independent experiments. Bon￾ferroni correction for multiple testing was performed where
applicable. Results were considered significant if p < 0.05.
All error bars represent SD. Drug interactions were ana￾lyzed based on the median effect method of Chou and
Talalay [35]. CalcuSyn software (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK)
was used to calculate the combination index (CI). CI values
from 0.3 to 0.7 are considered to indicate synergism, CI
values below 0.3 are considered to represent strong syner￾gism, and values below 0.1 very strong synergism. IC50
values were calculated using CurveExpert Professional 1.3
software. Chi-squared test was used to test for significant
differences in mouse survival.

were treated with 100 nM RAD001, 1.7 μM MK-2206, the combination of
both, or DMSO, over 24 h, and mTOR and AKT signaling pathway activity
was analyzed by Western blot. HSC70 served as loading control.

every other day during the first 18 day treatment period. Until day 15, no
statistically significant changes in body weight were detected. Weight
loss at day 18 in MK-2206 and Placebo treated animals was due to tumor
cachexia, and these animals had to be withdrawn from the experiment.
