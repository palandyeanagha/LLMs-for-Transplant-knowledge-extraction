Abstract
Background: Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome (CDS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by
nonbullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (NCIE) and an intracellular accumulation of triacylglycerol (TG)
droplets in most tissues. The clinical phenotype involves multiple organs and systems, including liver, eyes, ears,
skeletal muscle and central nervous system (CNS). Mutations in ABHD5/CGI58 gene are associated with CDS.
Methods: Eight CDS patients belonging to six different families from Mediterranean countries were enrolled for
genetic study. Molecular analysis of the ABHD5 gene included the sequencing of the 7 coding exons and of the
putative 5’ regulatory regions, as well as reverse transcript-polymerase chain reaction analysis and sequencing of
normal and aberrant ABHD5 cDNAs.
Results: Five different mutations were identified, four of which were novel, including two splice-site mutations
(c.47+1G>A and c.960+5G>A) and two large deletions (c.898_*320del and c.662-1330_773+46del). All the reported
mutations are predicted to be pathogenic because they lead to an early stop codon or a frameshift producing a
premature termination of translation. While nonsense, missense, frameshift and splice-site mutations have been
identified in CDS patients, large genomic deletions have not previously been described.
Conclusions: These results emphasize the need for an efficient approach for genomic deletion screening to ensure
an accurate molecular diagnosis of CDS. Moreover, in spite of intensive molecular screening, no mutations were
identified in one patient with a confirmed clinical diagnosis of CDS, appointing to genetic heterogeneity of the
syndrome.
Introduction
Neutral-lipid storage diseases (NLSDs) are a clinically
heterogeneous group of non-lysosomal inherited disor￾ders characterized by the cytoplasmic accumulation of
lipid droplets (LDs) in most tissues. Clinical phenotypes
include myopathy (skeletal and heart muscle), liver
damage, ataxia, neurosensory hearing loss, ichthyosis,
sub-capsular cataracts, nystagmus, strabismus, and,
rarely, mental retardation [1-6]. When non-bullous con￾genital ichthyosiform erythroderma (NCIE), presenting
as fine scaling on erythematous skin, is the dominant
feature of NLSD since birth, the disorder is referred to
as Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome (CDS [MIM 275630])
or neutral lipid storage disease with ichthyosis (NLSDI).
Patients are sometimes born as collodion babies. Serum
lipids are normal, whereas muscle and hepatic enzymes
are frequently elevated compared to control values.
Besides granulocytes and other blood cells, LDs are seen
in multiple cell types, including fibroblasts, basal kerati￾nocytes, myocytes. and hepatocytes. Severe hepatic stea￾tosis consequent to liver LD accumulation can cause life
threatening portal hypertension [7,8]. Although ichthyo￾sis is always present, other clinical features of CDS may
vary. The biochemical defect found in all the CDS
patients is attributed to deficient fatty acid (FA) mobili￾zation [9-12]. As a consequence of this impairment, a

number of tissues other than adipose accumulate TGs in
LDs even in the absence of an excess of circulating FAs.
CDS is inherited as an autosomal recessive disorder
and has been reported in approximately 55 cases, parti￾cularly in families whose origins are in the Mediterra￾nean area and the Middle-East [13]. However, the
presence of CDS Families from Saudi Arabia, India and
Japan has also been reported [14]. The identification of
mutations in ABHD5 gene (originally called CGI58
[UniGene Hs.19385]), located on chromosome 3p21, in
nine CDS families from Algeria, Morocco, Turkey, and
France (13) strengthened the suggestion that CDS is a
unique clinical variety of NLSDs with a defined genetic
cause. The ABDH5 gene is comprised of 7 exons that
encompass about 28 kb of genomic DNA [MIM
604780]. The cDNA has an open reading frame of 1427
nucleotides that predict a 349-amino acid protein of
approximately 39 kDa. ABDH5 has been reported to
have two functions, one as a cofactor for adipose trigly￾ceride lipase (ATGL) [15], and the other as a lysopho￾sphatidic acid acyltransferase [16,17]. ATGL is a TG
hydrolase that promotes the catabolism of stored fat in
adipose and non adipose tissues [15]. The ATGL gene
(alias PNPLA2) has been identified as the causative gene
for the neutral lipid storage disease with myopathy with￾out ichthyosis (NLSDM) [18].
To date, 22 point mutations and small insertions/dele￾tions have been identified in the ABHD5 gene. We now
report a molecular study of six additional CDS families
from Southern Italy, Egypt, Palestine and Greece.
Genetic analysis of ABHD5 coding regions and their
flanking DNA sequences, as well as RT-PCR analysis of
ABHD5 complete cDNA, allowed us to identify novel
mutations, thus expanding the allelic spectrum of chro￾mosome-3p21-linked CDS to large genomic deletions.
The failure to detect any functional ABHD5 genomic
variation in one family provides evidence for the genetic
heterogeneity of CDS.
Patients and methods
Families and Specimens
Eight patients for whom a diagnosis of CDS had been
unambiguously established and eight unaffected relatives
from six families were investigated for ABHD5 muta￾tions (Table 1). Two families were from Italy (Molise:
patient A-II-1; Sicily: patient F-II-1) [7,19], one family
from Egypt (patient B-II-1) [20], one from Palestine
(patients C-II-2 and C-II-1) [21], one from Cyprus
(patient D-II-2) [22] and one from Greece (Athens:
patients E-II-1 and E-II-2) [23]. Two families were
known to be consanguineous because of marriages
between first cousins (Additional file 1 Figure S1).
Signed, informed consent was obtained from each
patient and each family member. Common diagnostic
criteria were: congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma
characterized by fine scales on an erythematous back￾ground, hepatomegaly or liver steatosis, raised serum
levels of aminotransferases, and the presence of Jordans’
bodies in granulocytes. The involvement of other organs
and systems (spleen, eyes, ears, skeletal muscles, bone
marrow, and CNS) was variable. Complete clinical eva￾luation of each CDS patient has been reported elsewhere
(Table 1). Skin biopsies were obtained from three
patients and two relatives, and fibroblast cultures were
established in minimal essential medium with Earle’s
salts supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum. The
cells were subcultured by trypsinization, as required
(5-15 passages), and aliquots were stored under liquid
nitrogen. When fibroblast cultures were not available,
DNA and RNA were extracted by conventional methods
from whole blood samples drawn from patients and
their relatives.
Cell microscopy
Peripheral blood smears or buffy coats were stained with
the May-Grünwald-Giemsa and Nile Red (NR) stain to
detect LDs in neutrophils and in monocytes by 100×
light and fluorescence microscopy [24]. Fibroblasts were
cultured on glass coverslips, allowed to adhere over￾night, observed under phase-contrast light microscopy
(40×; IX51, Olympus), fixed with 3.7% paraformaldeyde
and stained with NR prior to fluorescence microscopy
(40×). NR (Sigma-Aldrich) staining solution was freshly
prepared in DPBS (1:100 v/v) from a saturated solution
(1 mg/ml) in dimethylsulfoxide. Fluorescent images
were captured using a Leica MB5000B microscope
equipped with a DFC480 R2 digital camera and a Leica
Application Suite (LAS) software.
Genomic analysis
Oligonucleotides were selected to amplify and sequence
the seven exons of ABHD5, their intron/exon bound￾aries, and the candidate promoter regions. The primer
sequences are reported in Additional file 2 Table S1.
PCR was performed in a 50 μl mixture containing 200
ng of genomic DNA, using a PTC-200 thermocycler (MJ
Research). PCR conditions for genomic amplifications of
exons 2-7 were reported by Lefèvre et al. [13] To
amplify exon 1, we used the DyNAzyme EXT (Finn￾zymes), and the PCR reaction was performed in 10%
DMSO (annealing: 50°C).
The sequence spanning 5 kb upstream from the ATG
starting codon of the ABHD5 gene was scanned for
transcription factors AP-2, Sp1, GCF, NF-D, T-Ag by
the program PROSCAN Version 1.7. Two putative pro￾moter sequences were identified through this analysis;
they were localized at about 5 and 0.3 Kb upstream
from the ATG starting codon of the ABHD5 gene,

spanning respectively 251 and 245 nt. The first promoter
region was amplified using 1F/1R primers, spanning from
-313 nt of the ABDH5 promoter to 338 nt of ABDH5
exon 1. A nested PCR was performed, using aF/aR and
bF/bR primer pairs, to analyze the second putative
promoter region. The aF/aR cycling profile was as fol￾lows: denaturation at 94°C for 4 min, annealing at 50°C
for 30 sec and extension at 70°C for 3 min for the first
round; denaturation at 94°C for 30 sec, annealing at 50°C
for 30 sec and extension at 70°C for 3 min for 30 cycles;
denaturation at 94°C for 30 sec, annealing at 50°C for 30
sec and terminal extension at 70°C for 10 min for the last
cycle. The PCR reaction was performed in 25 μl with 4%
of DMSO, using the DyNAzyme EXT. 0.5 μl of aF/aR
PCR was used to perform the next amplification with bF/
bR primers. 30 cycles of amplification were performed
using Taq Polymerase and the same cycling profile of aF/
aR primers with the exception of the extension (45 sec).
ABHD5 large deletions were identified amplifying
genomic DNA with 6F/7R and 4aF/6R primer pairs.
PCR conditions for 4aF/6R primers were as follows: hot
start at 96°C for 5 min; denaturation at 94°C for 40 sec,
annealing at 55°C for 40 sec, extension at 68°C for 5
min for 30 cycles; denaturation at 94°C for 40 sec,
annealing at 55°C for 40 sec and terminal extension at
68°C for 30 min for the last cycle. The JumpStart Accu￾Taq LA DNA Polymerase (Sigma) was used to perform
the long-range PCR of this large fragment. All the PCR
products were purified (NucleoSpin Extract II; M-Medi￾cal) and sequenced on 3730 DNA Analyzers (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA) by the BigDye Terminator
V1.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems).
Reverse-Transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and cDNA analysis
Total RNA (1 μg) isolated from whole blood by the TRI￾zol method (Invitrogen, Carslbad, CA) was converted to
cDNA by RT-PCR using random hexamers (0.5 μg), 400
units of MMLV-RT, 1.6 mM total dNTPs, 20 units of
Rnasin, 0.4 mM dithiothreitol, in 50 μl of reaction solu￾tion containing 10 × RT Buffer. Five microliters of cDNA
was used to perform PCR amplification using 8F/8R and
9F/9R primer pairs designed to produce overlapping frag￾ments covering the entire sequence of the ABHD5 tran￾script (GenBank accession number AF151816). PCR
conditions for 8F/8R primers were as follows: denatura￾tion at 96°C for 3 min, annealing at 64°C for 40 sec and
extension at 72°C for 1 min for the first round, denatura￾tion at 95°C for 40 sec, annealing at 64°C for 40 sec and
extension at 72°C for 1 min for 35 cycles; denaturation at
95°C for 40 sec, annealing at 64°C for 40 sec and terminal
extension at 72°C for 3 min for the last cycle. For this
PCR reaction the DyNAzyme EXT was used. PCR condi￾tions for 9F/9R primer pairs consisted of an initial dena￾turation for 5 min at 94°C, 37 cycles of denaturation for
30 sec at 94°C, annealing for 30 sec at 56°C, and exten￾sion for 1 min at 72°C. Specific sets of primers were
selected to reveal the consequences of ABHD5 nucleotide
variations localized in splice-site sequences; they were
2aF/2R for c.47+1G>A and 9aF/9R for c.960+5G>A
mutations. PCR conditions for 2aF/2R and 9aF/9R primer
pairs were the same as those used for 9F/9R.
The PCR products were electrophoresed on a 2%
agarose gel containing ethidium bromide and their sizes
compared with those of the corresponding ABHD5
cDNA fragments from control subjects under a UV illu￾minator. RT-PCR products of CDS patients were
sequenced.
Results
Patients
The two main clinical features of CDS (i.e. NCIE and
hepatomegaly or liver steatosis) were present in all
families investigated in this study, but with considerable
variation in the extent and degree of organ involvement
in individual patients (Table 1). Hepatosplenomegaly
and steatosis were first observed in patient B-II-1 as
early as 9 months of age and in D-II-2, E-II-1 and E-II￾2 patients at age 20-22 months. In patients F-II-1 and
A-II-1, hepatosplenomegaly was noted at age 16 and 42,
respectively, when the patients were diagnosed clinically.
Reduction in liver size was observed in patient E-II-1
(3 years old) after a medium-chain TG diet. At the age
of 8 years, still on the special diet, the E-II-1 patient had
a normal liver size and normal plasma aminotransferase
activities [23]. Serum aminotransferases were moderately
elevated in all patients, with the exception of C-II-2 e
C-II-1. Pediatric-age cataracts were present in patients
C-II-3, C-II-2, D-II-2, E-II-1 and E-II-2. On ophthalmo￾logic examination, bilateral nuclear cataracts were also
seen in A-II-1 at age 42. Bilateral ectropion was the
only ocular abnormality in patient B-II-1. No ophthal￾mologic abnormalities were observed for F-II-1. As
reported by other authors, clinical evidence of myopathy
in NCIE patients usually begins in their thirties. Never￾theless, as shown by abnormal electromyography, one of
our pediatric patients, B-II-1, presented with myopathy
and C-II-2, C-II-1 and D-II-2 patients (13, 12 and 9
years old, respectively) presented with a mild myopathy.
Serum creatine kinase was elevated in C-II-2, C-II-1 and
D-II-2 patients, but was normal in B-II-1. Neurological
abnormalities are generally considered to be a late mani￾festation of the disease. Most of our patients did not
show any neurological impairment, with the exception
of C-II-2 and C-II-1 patients. In these two patients, pure
tone audiometry also demonstrated neurosensory
deafness.

MGG and fluorescence detection of LDs in leukocytes and
fibroblasts from CDS patients
In the peripheral buffy coat smears of all CDS patients,
stained with MGG and NR, we identified a variable per￾centage of Jordans’ bodies in neutrophilic and eosino￾philic granulocytes and in monocytes (Figure 1A).
Examination of peripheral blood smears demonstrated
prominent cytoplasmic vacuoles in virtually every granu￾locyte and monocyte of C-II-2 and C-II-1 patients.
Eighty to ninety percent of neutrophils, eosinophils and
basophils contained multiple LDs, as did monocytes
obtained from the remaining CDS patients (A-II-1, B-II￾1, D-II-2, E-II-1 and E-II-2), with the exception of F-II￾1, for whom lipid vacuoles were present in only 25% of
granulocytes and monocytes. Semi-confluent CDS and
control cultured fibroblasts were observed under phase￾contrast light microscopy and stained with NR prior to
fluorescence microscopy (Figure 1B). The number and
size of LDs in CDS fibroblasts were consistently higher
than in control cells. Large lipid vacuoles persisted
through multiple passages and were present even when
the CDS fibroblasts were grown in lipid-free media
(data not shown).
ABHD5/CGI58 Mutations
DNA sequence analysis of the putative promoter
regions, of the seven coding exons and of the exon￾intron boundaries of ABHD5 gene was performed in
eight CDS patients and their relatives. Five different
mutations were found in the six families from the Medi￾terranean area (Table 2). 5 CDS patients, A-II-1, B-II-1,
C-II-2, C-II-1 and D-II-2, were homozygotes for
ABHD5 mutations, and two patients, E-II-1 and E-II-2,
were compound heterozygotes. No ABHD5 mutations
were identified in patient, F-II-1. The new sequences
were submitted to GenBank (accession numbers are
shown in Table 2). All identified mutations segregated
within families. The wild-type ABHD5 genomic
sequence was extracted from GenBank accession num￾ber NG_007090.3. In the two families of Greek (E) and
Greek-Cypriot origin (D), two new genomic rearrange￾ments were detected. Patient D-II-2 showed the
c.898_*320del mutation resulting in premature termina￾tion of the protein, p.I300X (Additional file 3 Figure S2).
Sequence analysis revealed a 1058 deletion that removed
63 bp of exon 6, intron 6 and exon 7 (Figure 2A).
Although the D and E CDS families are not known to
be related, we found the same c.898_*320del mutation
in E-II-1 and E-II-2 patients, providing evidence for the
existence of a distal common ancestor. E-II-1 and E-II-2
subjects inherited this deletion maternally and another
new large deletion paternally, the c.662-1330_773+46del
mutation (Figure 2B). The last rearrangement occurred
within intron 4 and removed part of intron 4, exon 5
and part of intron 5. ABHD5 cDNA encompassing
exons 4, 5, 6 and 7 was examined by RT-PCR primers
in control, heterozygous parents (E-I-1, E-I-2) and
patients’ samples (E-II-1, E-II-2) (Figure 3A). Normal
(576 bp) and aberrant PCR products (464 and 277 bp)
were excised and sequenced, showing that one aberrant
band resulted from the exon 5 skipping and the second
one from skipping of both exons 5 and 6 (Figure 3B).
The ABHD5 mRNA lacking exon 5 was the most com￾mon transcript in E-II-1 and E-II-2 patients. The aber￾rantly spliced mRNA would be expected to result in the
production of a protein lacking 129 amino acids in the
C-terminal region of ABHD5 (p.G221VfsX9). Another
RT-PCR product of about 400 bp was present in E-II-1,
E-II-2 and control subjects; it consisted of non-specific
sequence (Figure 3A).
In the CDS patient from Molise, A-II-1, a novel homo￾zygous mutation, the c.47+1G>A, was detected. This is

a splice-site mutation affecting the invariant G of the
intron-1 donor splice-site GT dinucleotide (Additional
file 4 Figure S3A). This splice-site mutation is expected
to lead to aberrant splicing with retention of intron 1;
this was confirmed by RT-PCR (Additional file 5 Figure
S4A). Using the 2F/2aR primer pairs, no amplification
product was expected from control cDNA since the for￾ward primer (2F) localizes within intron 1. A 215 bp
RT-PCR product was obtained from A-II-1 cDNA
amplified with the 2F/2aR primers, showing that intron
1 was not eliminated during RNA splicing in this
patient. Direct sequencing of the 215 bp RT-PCR pro￾duct confirmed that A-II-1 cDNA contained the entire
intron 1 sequence (Additional file 5 Figure S4C). The
c.47+1G>A mutation resulted in a truncation of
the ABHD5 ORF at a premature stop codon located at
the beginning of intron 1. The mutated protein is pre￾dicted to consist of only 17 amino acids (pS17fsX1).

A novel mutation was also detected in the C-II-2 and
C-II-1 patients from Palestine. This homozygous splice￾donor-site mutation, c.960+5G>A, caused abnormal
RNA splicing (Additional file 4 Figure S3B). The region
of the ABHD5 transcript, including exons 6 and 7, was
amplified by RT-PCR. Instead of the expected cDNA
fragment (236 bp), a longer cDNA fragment of 821 bp
in size was detected (Additional file 5 Figure S4B).
Sequence analysis showed that the longer cDNA pro￾duct arose from abnormal retention of intron 6 (Addi￾tional file 5 Figure S4D). The c.960+5G>A splice-site
mutation creates a premature stop codon within intron
6 and removes 29 amino acids from the C-terminal tail
of the protein (p.A321VfsX10).
In the Egyptian family, the p.R234X mutation was
present. The same mutation had been identified in an
adult case of CDS by Schleinitz et al. [25]. None of the
novel mutations, identified in CDS patients, were
observed in more than 100 alleles from control sub￾jects. Finally, RT-PCR analysis and sequencing of full￾length ABHD5 cDNA was performed in F-II-1 patient
(Sicily) for which no genomic mutations were found.
This result confirmed the negative DNA analysis and
excluded distant intronic mutations that might have
affected mRNA splicing. Furthermore, direct sequen￾cing of two putative promoter regions upstream the
ATG starting codon of ABHD5 gene failed to detect
any pathogenic mutation.
Discussion
Since the identification of the ABHD5/CGI58 gene and
the detection of its mutations in nine CDS families by
Lefèvre et al [13], CDS (NLSD with ichthyosis) has been
considered to be a unique clinical variant of NLSD with
a defined genetic cause. ABHD5 is a co-activator of
ATGL, a novel lipase that catalyses the initial step of
TG hydrolysis in adipocyte and non-adipocyte LDs [15].
These data suggest an important biochemical role for
ABHD5 in the intracellular catabolism of neutral lipids
and provide an explanation for the pathogenic effects of
ABHD5 mutations. In addition, ABHD5 is a lysopho￾sphatidic acid acyltransferase; the relationship of this
activity to the clinical phenotype remains unclear
[16,17].
Our study extends the spectrum of ABHD5 disease￾causing mutations in CDS. Sequence analysis reveals
five different mutations distributed all along the
ABHD5 gene in eight CDS patients from six families
from the Mediterranean area. The identified genetic
variations include one nonsense mutation, two splice￾site substitutions and, for the first time, two large dele￾tions. In order to verify whether these large genomic
rearrangements could be explained by a common
mutational mechanism, the RepeatMasker Software
(Institute for System Biology, Seattle, WA, USA) was
used and the repeat elements or sequence homologies
around the breakpoints were analyzed. While the prox￾imal breakpoint of c.898_*320del mutation
(g.31913_32970del1058) is not located within any
repeat sequence, its distal breakpoint lays within a X7B
LINE retrotransposon which belongs to the long inter￾spersed elements LINE-1 (or L1) (g.32956_33063).
Moreover, the presence of a micro-homology of 3 bp
plus 3 bp (i.e. TGC and TAG) in the junction
sequence/breakpoints accounts for the model of repli￾cation slippage [26] (Figure 4A). The second large
deletion c.662-1330_773+46del (g.277 35_29222
del1487) is also associated in cis to a 18 bp (g.27
698_27699ins18) insertion and a nucleotide deletion
(g.27730delG), which are not reported as ABHD5 poly￾morphisms (Figure 4B). The c.662-1330_773+46del
proximal breakpoint is near an Alu sequence, while its
distal breakpoint is located within a TG-simple repeat
and very close to an Alu element (distance: 75 bp).
Inside the deleted region there is another Alu
sequence which is lost in the mutated allele. Alu
repeat density in this region of ABHD5 gene (27010-
29611) is very high. These Alu elements belong to the
Alu-Sx subfamily and, like other repetitive sequences,
have been shown to be involved in molecular
mechanisms leading to rearrangements in the human
genome [27]. The data show that the c.662-1330_773
+46del mutation should be considered as a complex
gene rearrangement. This is probably due to a differ￾ent mutational mechanism in comparison with that
which occurred for the c.898_*320del mutation. The
consequences of gene deletions have been investigated
through an exhaustive analysis of normal and aber￾rant ABHD5 mRNAs. These deletions may lead to
shorter ABHD5 proteins, pG221VfsX9 and pI300X,
lacking 139 and 50 COOH-terminal amino acids,
respectively.
The splicing errors identified in our CDS families all
represent novel mutations. They are homozygous G to
A transitions which occurred in the splice consensus
motifs of introns 1 and 6. In patient A-II-1 from Molise,
the c.47+1G>A mutation eliminates approximately 96%
of the ABHD5 protein. The consequence of this muta￾tion may lead to the complete absence of the mutated
protein, through protein instability. The E-II-2 and E-II￾3 patients of Palestinian origin presented with the c.960
+5G>A mutation. This mutation is expected to give rise
to a truncated protein lacking 28 amino acids at the C￾terminal region of ABHD5 (consisting of 320 out of 349
amino acids).
In the Egyptian patient (B-II-1), the R234X homozy￾gous mutation conserves 67% of the ABHD5 wild-type
protein. This patient was a one-year-old boy with

generalized ichthyosis, bilateral ectropion, hepatospleno￾megaly (noted at the age of 9 months), myopathy and
an umbilical hernia. The same mutation had been pre￾viously identified in a 42-year-old man from France,
who was heterozygous for R284X and H82R [25].
Despite delayed confirmation of the diagnosis, this
patient presented with typical symptoms of CDS, includ￾ing NCIE, muscle weakness, bilateral sub-capsular
cataracts and neurosensory hearing loss. He did not
have liver dysfunction or CNS abnormalities. Some
important clinical differences emerged between the
Egyptian and French patients, concerning, in particular,
the hepatic involvement. These differences might be due
to homozygous versus heterozygous conditions or by
modifier genes and epigenetic factors which might be
involved in these variations.

All the mutations described in this work are predicted
to result in truncated proteins that lack different
ABHD5 regions (Additional file 6 Figure S5). In spite of
our efforts, it remains very difficult to find a correlation
between the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics,
since most of ABHD5 mutations are novel and unique.
Surprisingly, we noticed that the c.960+5G®A muta￾tion, which conserves 92% of the native protein, was
associated with patients severely affected by neurological
symptoms, hearing loss and myopathy (C-II-2, C-II3),
whereas the c.47+1G>A mutation that caused a dra￾matic truncation of the ABHD5 protein (p.S17X), was
associated with severe steatohepatitis but a relatively
mild phenotype concerning the other clinical CDS fea￾tures (patient: A-II-1). It is possible that the accumula￾tion of non-functional ABHD5 proteins has a more
deleterious consequence for cellular LD metabolism in
some tissues than total loss of the protein expression.
However, any explanation of this phenomenon remains
highly speculative, since the precise roles of the ABHD5
domains remain largely unknown. Nevertheless, we can
postulate that the consequence of the c.47+1G>A muta￾tion (p.S17X) would be similar to classical loss of func￾tion or a knockout mutation, as the residual peptide
contains only 17 of the 349 amino acids of the wild-type
protein.
The N-terminal region ABHD5 (1-30 amino acids) is
essential for correct localization to the lipid droplet and
ABHD5 lacking this amino acid region, loses the ability
to activate ATGL [28]. Four of the protein variants
retain the hydrophobic motif (Additional file 6: Figure
S5) but lack the HX4D motif, between amino acids 327
and 332, specific for proteins with acyltransferase activ￾ity [16]. Moreover, only 2 mutants retain both Q130
and E260, amino acid residues were previously identified
as essential for ABHD5-perilipin interaction as well as
for ATGL activation [15,29]. ABHD5 is a binding part￾ner for perilipin and ADRP, two proteins of the PAT￾domain family associated with the surface of LDs. Using
double-label immunocytochemistry, Granneman et al.
[30] found that perilipin acts as a link for ABHD5 when
adipocytes are in the basal state. After protein kinase A
(PKA) phosphorylation, perilipin decreases its interaction
with ABHD5 and ABHD5 increases its co-localization
with ATGL. One of the most important issues
that remains to be solved is to identify ABHD5 regions
(epitopes) that specifically interact with perilipin or with
other proteins. Structure and function analysis of
mutated ABHD5 proteins should be performed in order
to investigate potential intra-molecular interactions
between epitopes, as well as binding affinity to LDs
proteins.
We were unable to identify any mutation in ABHD5
in patient F-II-1. When this patient was first examined
at the age of 16, his health was good, although he had
congenital ichthyosis, hepatomegaly, a persistent
increase of GGT and a transient increase of transami￾nase, with no history of drug or alcohol abuse. On the
peripheral blood smear, LDs were detected in only
20-30% of neutrophilic and eosinophilic granulocytes
and in monocytes. On the basis of the clinical and histo￾logical findings, F-II-1 was diagnosed as having CDS
[19]. To provide an exhaustive analysis of the ABHD5
gene in this patient, we screened the putative promoter/
regulatory regions but failed to find any variation. The
absence of any mutation in the ABHD5 gene in F-II-1
suggests that the etiology of CDS is genetically heteroge￾neous. Similar to our results, in one family of Algerian
origin presenting with a CDS phenotype, Lefèvre et al.
[13] identified two regions of homozygosity, one consist￾ing of 11 cM on chromosome 3p21 (containing the
ABHD5 gene), and the other spanning 18 cM on chro￾mosome 14; this report and our evidence point to possi￾ble genetic heterogeneity of the syndrome. Although the
F-II-1 patient had no evidence of myopathy, we also
sequenced the ATGL gene but found no mutation.
CDS arises from a defect of LD metabolism leading to
a systemic increase in the size and number of these
cytosolic inclusions. Despite their classic denomination
as simple lipid structures, LDs are complex and highly
dynamic organelles [31] with a large complement of
associated proteins, including scaffold proteins, lipases
and co-activators, which have been found to change
their associations with lipid droplets in response to lipo￾lytic stimulation. Relatively little is known about tem￾poral and spatial relationships among these LD proteins.
Further studies are needed to identify new candidate
genes involved in NLSDs, and further extensive ABHD5
gene analysis in a larger panel of CDS families would be
useful in order to gain additional insights into the varia￾bility of clinical expression and the factors contributing
to CDS.
Conclusions
Our ABHD5 mutational analysis extends the molecular
genetic heterogeneity of CDS. We have identified new
splice site mutations and, for the first time, novel large
deletions, demonstrating that sequencing, long range
PCR and RT-PCR analysis are necessary to perform a
complete molecular screening for ABHD5 gene muta￾tions in order to avoid allelic drop-out phenomena.
Moreover, our findings contribute to understanding of
the complex effects that different ABHD5 gene muta￾tions may have on the CDS phenotype.

mutant variants retained the hydrophobic motif, located between
residues 69 and 87 (dark-grey area), that represents the putative lipid￾binding domain. However, all six mutant proteins lacked the HX4D motif
between amino acids 327 and 332, specific for proteins with
acyltransferase activity. Q130 and E260, reported in the models, have
previously been identified as essential residues for ABHD5-perilipin
interaction and for ATGL activation.
