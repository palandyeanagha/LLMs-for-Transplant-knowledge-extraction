Hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) or sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS)
is a rare complication characterized by hepatomegaly, right-upper quadrant pain,
jaundice, and ascites, occurring after high-dose chemotherapy, hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation (HSCT) and, less commonly, other conditions. We review pathogenesis,
clinical appearance and diagnostic criteria, risk factors, prophylaxis, and treatment of
the VOD occurring post-HSCT. The injury of the sinusoidal endothelial cells with loss of
wall integrity and sinusoidal obstruction is the basis of development of postsinusoidal
portal hypertension responsible for clinical syndrome. Risk factors associated with
the onset of VOD and diagnostic tools have been recently updated both in the
pediatric and adult settings and here are reported. Treatment includes supportive
care, intensive management, and specific drug therapy with defibrotide. Because
of its severity, particularly in VOD with associated multiorgan disease, prophylaxis
approaches are under investigation. During the last years, decreased mortality associated
to VOD/SOS has been reported being it attributable to a better intensive and
multidisciplinary approach.

INTRODUCTION
Hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD), also known as sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS),
is a clinical syndrome occurring after high-dose chemotherapy, hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation (HSCT) (1, 2), and, less commonly, after ingestion of toxic alkaloids (toxic
injury) (3), after high doses of radiotherapy (4) or liver transplantation (5). Clinical diagnosis
criteria include hepatomegaly, right-upper quadrant pain, ascites, and jaundice (6), although
anicteric forms may occur, particularly, but not exclusively among pediatric population (7). The
onset or the progression can be complicated by a multiorgan disease (MOD), characterized by
functional disorders affecting lungs (pleural effusion, pulmonary infiltrates, hypoxia), kidneys
(renal insufficiency/failure), and central nervous system (confusion, encephalopathy). Multiorgan
disease is associated with high mortality rate (exceeding 80%), and it has been identified as the best
predictive marker of severe VOD/SOS (8–10).
In HSCT patients, endothelial cell injury leads to loss of sinusoidal wall integrity, endothelial
cell detachment, sinusoidal obstruction, and development of postsinusoidal portal hypertension

Bonifazi et al. Diagnosis and Treatment of VOD/SOS
(PH) (11). The incidence of posttransplant VOD/SOS is highly
variable, ranging from 5.3% (12) to 13.7% (9) to higher
percentages, according to transplant settings and different
studies; particularly in pediatric high-risk populations, the
incidence could be 20 to 30% up to 60% (7, 13–15).
Transplant outcome is significantly affected by VOD/SOS
occurrence, where the mortality rates can reach up to 80%
in the severe forms, in older series (9), whereas more recent
studies report lower mortality rates (16, 17), in patients treated
with defibrotide. Early diagnosis and treatment are positively
correlated to a survival benefit (16). Treatment includes
supportive care, intensive treatment, and specific drug therapy.
PATHOPHYSIOLOGY
The initial step of VOD/SOS pathogenesis is the injury of
sinusoidal endothelium of the liver (Figure 1) leading to loss of
endothelial cell cohesions: gaps appear in the endothelial barrier,
and red blood cells pass through these gaps and accumulates
in the Disse space, causing the detachment of the endothelial
cells with downstream embolization of the centrilobular vein and
subsequent postsinusoidal obstruction (18).
Several causes (Figure 1) are incriminated into initial
endothelial damage, including conditioning regimens (19),
cytokines produced by injured tissues (20), endogenous
microbial products migrating through damaged mucosal
barriers (21), drugs used during the transplant [such as
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) or calcineurin
inhibitors] (22–24), and the engraftment process itself (25).
Conditioning regimens have a crucial role in the pathogenesis

plasminogen activator; MMP-9, matrix metallopeptidase 9.
as highlighted by the increased risk of VOD/SOS associated
with higher plasma levels of cytotoxic drugs, such as busulfan or
metabolites of cyclophosphamide (26). Chemotherapy drugs are
metabolized by the cytochrome P450 complex, producing toxic
metabolites subsequently converted to non-toxic ones by the
glutathione (GSH) enzymatic system and then eliminated (27).
Centrilobular regions of the liver are poor in GSH, making them
more sensitive to toxic agents and explaining the predominant
damage of centrilobular regions (28, 29). Moreover, a GSH
S-transferase M1 null genotype reducing the detoxifying capacity
of the liver parenchyma predisposes to SOS/VOD (30), and
the reduced detoxifying ability due to immature enzymatic
system could, at least partially, explain the higher incidence of
VOD/SOS in children (13).
Some clinical observations led to the hypothesis that
alloreactivity plays a role in VOD/SOS. Incidence of VOD/SOS
is higher after allogenic compared to autologous HSCT and is
higher in patients receiving a transplant from a mismatched
unrelated donor (31). These observations are supported by
findings in experimental models where endothelial cells are
targets of alloreactive T cells (32).
Endothelial cells after HSCT show signs of injury
characterized by procoagulant and proinflammatory status
(Figure 1). This status is confirmed by the presence of increased
levels of circulating markers of endothelial activation after HSCT,
such as endothelial procoagulant factors and adhesion molecules
(20), circulating endothelial cells (33), endothelial progenitor
cells (34), and microparticles (35).
Endothelial cell detachment seems to be correlated with
nitric oxide deficiency caused by postconditioning toxicity (36).

Nitric oxide deficiency promotes increased endothelial cell
production of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) that seems
to be strongly involved in VOD/SOS development, probably
promoting the endothelial cell detachment. The role of MMP￾9 in the VOD/SOS pathogenesis is supported by the evidence
that the in vivo inhibition of MMPs completely prevents its
occurrence (37).
Along with the embolization by detached endothelial cells,
blood flow obstruction is promoted by the proliferation of
perisinusoidal stellate cells and subendothelial fibroblasts in
the terminal hepatic vein followed by the deposition of the
extracellular matrix (38). Then perivenular fibrosis spreads into
the liver parenchyma (39). All these events lead to a block in
liver blood outflow, with progressive obliteration of the venules
and centrilobular sinusoidal, causing hepatic congestion and the
development of postsinusoidal PH (40).
Because of the central role of endothelial injury in its
pathogenesis, VOD/SOS is now classified as a transplant￾related endothelial dysfunction, as well as posttransplant
microangiopathy, idiopathic pneumonia, diffuse alveolar
hemorrhage, and engraftment syndrome (11).
CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND
DIAGNOSIS
The clinical presentation of VOD/SOS is the consequence of the
PH, being characterized by rapid weight gain, tendentially
unresponsive to diuretics, hyperbilirubinemia, painful
hepatomegaly, and ascites. It generally occurs within 21 days
after transplant, late-onset VOD/SOS is nowadays recognized
as distinct VOD/SOS feature by recent diagnostic criteria
elaborated by the European Society for Blood and Marrow
Transplantation (EBMT) (41) (Table 1). It has been already
reported that late VOD/SOS occurs at least in 39.3% and 16.7%,
respectively, in the adult and pediatric setting (16).
The onset of VOD/SOS can be either smoldering or disruptive,
ranging from mild forms spontaneously resolving within few
weeks to severe forms with organ damage and MOD. Multiorgan
disease, involving generally pulmonary and renal functions, can
rapidly occur, significantly worsening the outcome (17, 41, 42).
Because of the high mortality rate of severe VOD/SOS, daily
monitoring for prompt detection of symptoms, such as jaundice,
hepatomegaly, fluid overload with weight gain and ascites (42),
is required. Although it remains a life-threatening condition,
progresses in the management of severe VOD/SOS improved the
outcome compared to the past (43).
The “traditional” diagnosis of VOD/SOS is based on
fulfillment of either Baltimore (44) or modified Seattle criteria (6)
(Table 1) and the exclusion of differential diagnosis.
Several conditions, such as fluid overload, constrictive
pericarditis, ascites of different origin (pancreatic, chylous),
drug-induced cholestasis and more generally drug-induced liver
injury (DILI), cholangitis lenta, sepsis, infectious hepatitis,
parenteral nutrition, cholestasis, and hepatic graft-versus-host
disease (GvHD), can mimic VOD/SOS and still make real-life
differential diagnosis a true challenge or pitfall.
The main difference between the two diagnostic systems is
hyperbilirubinemia being mandatory in the Baltimore criteria,
which implies longer time waiting for its development or
intrinsically more aggressive forms. Up to 30% of children
with VOD/SOS was anicteric (7, 45, 46) compared to 12%
of adults. The clinical scenario can be variable, in particular
in children where anicteric forms are not rare (13, 47) and
dynamically changing.

Bonifazi et al. Diagnosis and Treatment of VOD/SOS
For these reasons, the EBMT proposed, both in adult
(Table 1A) and in pediatric (Table 1B) setting, new different
diagnostic criteria and a scale for severity grading of suspected
VOD/SOS (13, 41).
The EBMT criteria for adult patients (41) foresee two clinical
entities: the classical VOD/SOS appearing within 21 days after
HSCT with bilirubin ≥2 mg/mL and two of the following criteria:
painful hepatomegaly, weight gain, and ascites. The late-onset
VOD/SOS occurs beyond 21 days after transplantation and
potentially presents as follows:
1. Same feature as the classical one,
2. It should be histologically proven, and
3. Two out of four criteria for the classical VOD/SOS (bilirubin
≥2 mg/mL, weight gain >5%, painful hepatomegaly, and
ascites) plus hemodynamic or ultrasound (US) evidence
of VOD/SOS.
In the pediatric setting (13), there are no distinctions related
to the time of onset, and no time limitations are given. The
fulfillment of at least two of the following criteria is required
for diagnosis: the unexplained consumptive and transfusion￾refractory thrombocytopenia, an otherwise unexplained weight
gain on 3 consecutive days despite the use of diuretics or a
weight gain 5% above the baseline value, hepatomegaly (best if
confirmed by imaging) above the baseline value, ascites (best
if confirmed by imaging) above the baseline value, and rising
bilirubin from the baseline on 3 consecutive days or bilirubin ≥2
mg/dL within 72h.
The main differences between the diagnostic criteria of adult
and children are the bilirubin increase, which can be missing
mainly in the pediatric setting, in a significant proportion of cases
and the presence of refractory thrombocytopenia. It should be
reminded that the criteria have been established from different
panels of experts, following a consensus-based approach; the
refractoriness of thrombocytopenia to transfusion has been called
in to discussion also for the adult criteria system but not finally
adopted as a criterion because of lack of panel consensus. These
criteria need to be further validated by forthcoming prospective
studies (48).
Both adult and pediatric criteria have been associated to
severity grading scales that are related to the dynamic changes,
mainly the evolution of hepatic and renal function tests (Table 2).
The speed of changes is considered a warning sign belonging
to higher severity grading scale (for suspected VOD/SOS) and
hence supporting early treatment initiation with potential clinical
outcome improvement. This score system can be also used in
case of suspected VOD/SOS, before patients meet the diagnostic
criteria, especially before day 21 (41).
The EBMT diagnostic criteria for adults include a late-onset
VOD/SOS where both histology and US attain key roles for
the diagnosis itself. In pediatric setting, the role of imaging
has been significantly upgraded, as suggested by the EBMT
diagnostic criteria, which recommend hepatomegaly and ascites
to be confirmed by imaging during the clinical course and
immediately before HSCT (13).
Among imaging techniques, US is certainly one of the
most commonly studied as it allows assessment of both
parenchymal and vascular changes; it is cheap and can be used
bedside. However, even though US has been recognized as an
EBMT diagnostic criterion, its role is restricted to diagnosis
confirmation, when clinical signs are already noticeable.
Ultrasound and Doppler US can easily detect the typical signs of
PH such as ascites, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and dilatation
of portal vein, which are commonly present in symptomatic
VOD/SOS. The first article describing systematically these typical
US and US Doppler diagnostic criteria was published by Lassau
et al. (49). The prospective study included 100 patients having
undergone HSCT; 25 of 100 patients developed VOD/SOS. The
authors used seven morphologic and seven Doppler criteria
to define the value of US in the prediction, diagnosis, and
prognostic assessment of VOD/SOS. Based on these 14 criteria,
a diagnostic score was then produced; a score of 6 had a
sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 87%. However, at the
best of US performance, ∼20% of the VOD/SOS could be
misdiagnosed according to the Lassau score. A recent article by
Park et al. (50) confirmed that some morphological parameters
such as ascites and gallbladder wall thickening were significantly
associated (odds ratio, respectively, 56.3 and 36.3) to VOD/SOS
diagnosis. Nishida et al. (51) proposed a novel scoring system
(HokUS-10) based on 10 US variables, which was able to predict
VOD/SOS diagnosis with sensitivity of 100% and specificity
of 95.8% in 10 patients. Although HokUS-10 score is easier
to apply than the Lassau score, it still has to be adequately
validated. There is much evidence on the utility of US imaging
as a diagnostic tool; nevertheless, its role is still controversial
because of lack of reproducibility and the requirement need of
an expert sonographer, especially for US Doppler. Furthermore,
some US Doppler signs (e.g., patency of paraumbilical vein)
appear when an advanced stage of VOD/SOS has already
been developed; thus, its application may be very limited to
early diagnose or to anticipate the clinical VOD/SOS diagnosis.
The use of ultrasonographic contrast agent, which is able to
assess the hepatic vascularization, has been used to facilitate
the diagnosis and to evaluate treatment response (52, 53)
in VOD/SOS setting.
Because magnetic resonance and computed tomography
represent the gold standard techniques for focal liver lesions
identification, particularly in cancer staging and surveillance,
their use is still pivotal in post-HSCT VOD/SOS (42, 54, 55).
However, the potential role of these imaging techniques can
be further increased in all types of VOD/SOS (56). Major
limitation for a broader use is related to logistic issues, mainly
in critical patients.
Because of the potential complications of hepatic biopsy in
thrombocytopenic patients (i.e., hemorrhage, hemobilia, shock),
the possibility of a histologic diagnosis of VOD/SOS is quite
limited to well-trained centers with dedicated multidisciplinary
team and cannot be considered a routine practice. Transjugular
biopsy can limit the risk of bleeding and allow the measurement
of the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG), although the
risk of unreadable specimens can be accounted (57). Hepatic
venous pressure gradient is the hallmark of PH: its measurement
is a very specific tool for VOD/SOS diagnosis, and values
>10 mm Hg predict VOD/SOS with good level of accuracy

and specificity (58). The main limitation consists in being an
invasive procedure.
In patients with advanced chronic hepatic disease, the
measurement of PH via HVPG has been replaced by hepatic
stiffness measurement performed by elastography, which is a
non-invasive method. Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by
transient elastography has been introduced several years ago
to stage liver diseases (59); since then, numerous experiences
have demonstrated a good correlation between liver stiffness
and liver disease grading (60). Thus, LSM progressively allowed
reducing the number of liver biopsies performed in patients
with advanced liver disease. Moreover, it was observed that LSM
could also be useful to measure PH, because it closely correlates
with HVPG (61). Elastography was used to predict VOD/SOS in
HSCT patients. Recent studies (62–64) investigated the predictive
role of LSM changes, assessed by transient elastography (TE)
or shear wave elastography, in post-HSCT VD/SOS in pediatric
and adult patients. Liver stiffness measurement values assessed
by TE in healthy subjects without liver pathology range between
4.3 and 5.3 kPa (65, 66), whereas a threshold of 21 kPa holds a
high specificity (>90%) and can be used to confirm the presence
of clinically significant portal hypertension (67, 68). In HSCT
patients, LSMs were carried out at baseline and once a week after
HSCT. Only in patients who developed VOD/SOS, LSM values
markedly increased compared to previous measurement (from
10.3–59.3 vs. 3.5–7.5 kPa) (62, 63). Liver stiffness measurement
increases from 1 to 15 days before clinical VOD/SOS diagnosis
and most intriguingly LSM decreased after the start of defibrotide
treatment parallel to clinical signs of VOD/SOS (e.g., bilirubin,
weight) (63–69). Based on these results, it was speculated that
LSM, a non-invasive method, executable bedside, can be useful to
perform both a preclinical diagnosis of VOD/SOS and to monitor
treatment response. Main limitations for a wide application
of this method are the need of a specific training of the
operator, the presence of significant amount of ascites, and a
body mass index >30 kgm2
. Based on preliminary results, an
Italian national multicenter prospective trial (“ElastoVOD/SOS
Study,” ClinicalTrial.gov NCT03426358) is actually running,
aimed to confirm the prognostic role of LSM in a prospective
multicenter context.
Several biomarkers (70) have been proposed for VOD/SOS
diagnosis and/or prevention; they are markers of hemostasis
and coagulation such as plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI￾1) or other markers of endothelial injury, such as elevated
levels of von Willebrand factor, thrombomodulin, soluble
intercellular adhesion molecule 1, suppressor of tumorigenicity
2, angiopoietin 2, hyaluronic acid (HA), or markers of
inflammation [interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-10, CD97].
Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 5 April 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 489

Bonifazi et al. Diagnosis and Treatment of VOD/SOS
The increased level of PAI-1 antigen is the most studied
marker for its role as a predictor of VOD/SOS (71–74), whereas
a decrease of its level has been correlated with better treatment
outcome (75). Anyway, the proteomic-based approach published
by Akil et al. (76) failed to include PAI-1 in the final predictive
model. In this model only L-ficolin, HA, and vascular cell
adhesion molecule 1 showed a prognostic value for diagnosis.
Available data on single or combined panel of biomarkers for
VOD/SOS are still inconclusive, and a wide application in the real
world is so far marginal.
INCIDENCE AND RISK FACTORS
The incidence of VOD/SOS after transplantation varies
substantially from 2 to 60% (6, 7, 12, 13, 16, 47) because of both
different setting of patients and transplant procedures and of
application of different diagnostic criteria.
The incidence of VOD/SOS is higher in children than in
adults (7, 9, 13–16, 47), although a retrospective analysis of a
large Italian pediatric cohort (47) found a surprisingly very low
incidence of VOD/SOS [2% (95% confidence interval, 1.7–2.5)].
Risk factors are generally classified as either patient related
or transplantation related (77). Among the former ones, age,
Karnofsky index, any preexisting liver disease, altered liver
function tests, advanced hematological disease, second transplant
thalassemia and ferritin level, and abdominal radiation are risk
factors reported in literature since the last two decades.
The use of new immunotherapies for the therapy of acute
leukemias, such as gemtuzumab ozogamicin for acute myeloid
leukemia and inotuzumab ozogamicin for acute lymphoblastic
leukemia, is associated with a significant increase of VOD/SOS
risk (77–79), mainly related to the subsequent HSCT. In this
respect, avoidance of more than two inotuzumab ozogamicin
cycles and double alkylators in the preparing regimen and
the use of ursodeoxycholic acid are recommended in patients
suffering from relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia
undergoing allogeneic HSCT after inotuzumab ozogamicin
treatment (80).
The following transplantation-related risk factors should
be mentioned (77): allogeneic vs. autologous transplant,
mismatched/haploidentical transplant, T-replete transplants,
and myeloablative-preparing regimen containing either busulfan
or total body irradiation.
The odds ratios of each risk factor reported by the review from
Dalle and Giralt (77) are those reported from each reference, sic
et simpliciter, without a risk score–building purpose.
Recently, the Center for International Blood and Marrow
Transplant Research developed a risk score built on a large
population series of more than 13,000 patients (81). Younger age,
positive hepatitis B/C serology, lower Karnofsky index, use of
sirolimus, disease at transplant, and myeloablative-conditioning
regimen were associated to higher risk of VOD/SOS. The
authors did not include pretransplant therapies impacting on
VOD/SOS, so the applicability of this model to patient receiving
either gemtuzumab ozogamicin or inotuzumab ozogamicin is
still unknown. Prospective validation of risk factors is yet to
be completed and needs further assessment to provide a more
precise estimation of the magnitude of each risk factor (70).
TREATMENT AND OUTCOME
The treatment of VOD/SOS includes supportive and intensive
care in addition to the specific therapy with defibrotide.
Supportive care and clinical monitoring are primary issues
in the management of VOD/SOS throughout the whole HSCT
course, in order to promptly capture clinical diagnostic criteria,
to timely record all dynamic changes and to follow both the
response to treatment and disease progression. Daily reports of
several parameters, such as abdominal circumference, weight,
and diuresis, are recommended (13, 41). The nurse group of
the Italian Society of Bone Marrow Transplantation elaborated
an operational flowchart for a dynamic nursing monitoring of
patients with suspected or proven VOD/SOS (82). Supportive
care includes a careful evaluation of fluid balance with diuretics,
as well as all therapeutic measures aimed to reduce the discomfort
of massive ascites, pleural effusion, hypoxia, pain, and renal
dysfunction such as paracentesis, thoracentesis, oxygen therapy
according to the respiratory parameters, analgesic therapy,
hemodialysis, or hemofiltration. A transfer to the intensive care
unit can be required. The therapy at the intensive care unit is
symptomatic and may differ among centers.
Defibrotide is the only registered drug for the
treatment of moderate/severe VOD/SOS; it is a mixture of
polydeoxyribonucleotide, mainly single-stranded, derived from
the porcine intestinal mucosa. Its mechanism of action is not
yet fully understood (83, 84). Oligonucleotides interact with
heparin-binding proteins such as fibroblast growth factors,
which exert fibrogenetic as well as angiogenetic effects with
endothelial stabilization. Moreover, defibrotide acts as an
antithrombotic and profibrinolytic drug; it reduces platelet
adhesion and activation, without systemic anticoagulant effects,
by means of inhibition of PAI-1, thrombin, and leukocyte
adhesion process (via inhibition of P-selectin expression),
and also decreases vascular permeability and apoptosis due to
calcineurin inhibitors and chemotherapy, without interfering
with antitumor effect of cytotoxic drugs (85). Because of the
capacity of defibrotide to protect endothelium from toxic,
inflammatory, and ischemic damage, its potential therapeutic use
has been tested, some decades ago, in several vascular disorders
such as thrombophlebitis (86, 87), in postsurgery deep vein
thrombosis prophylaxis (88, 89), and peripheral arterial diseases
(90) with significant benefits. It has been used, even in a pivotal
way, in acute myocardial infarction (91), in postthrombolysis
reocclusion of coronary (92), ischemic damage of the liver (93),
diabetic microangiopathy, and Reynaud phenomenon (94).
The efficacy and safety of defibrotide in the setting
of VOD/SOS, especially after HSCT, have been extensively
evaluated by different authors. The first study is a historically
controlled multicenter open-label phase III study (95) recruiting
patients from 1995 to 2008; participating centers prospectively
enrolled patients with established hepatic VOD/SOS to receive
defibrotide 25 mg/kg per day, whereas the placebo cohort

(32 patients) was retrospectively identified from 6,867 medical
charts of HSCT patients by blinded independent reviewers in
order to minimize the selection bias. The unusual study design
(retrospective vs. prospective comparison) is due to the refusal
of participating centers to accept a prospective randomization
with placebo resulting unethical (orphan disease with high
mortality). This study adopted the VOD/SOS diagnosis criteria,
and severe VOD/SOS was defined as a VOD/SOS complicated by
MOD. The primary endpoint was 100-day mortality; secondary
endpoints were 100-day complete response (CR) rate and 6-
month overall survival. The study demonstrated both 100-day
survival and CR benefit favoring the defibrotide arm (38.2
vs. 25.0% and 25.5 vs. 12.5%, respectively). Median duration
of therapy was 21.5 days, and 10.7% of patients discontinued
defibrotide for treatment-related adverse event (AE). Adverse
events were similar in the two arms, particularly hemorrhagic
events (64% in the experimental arm vs. 75% in the historical
control arm). Pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage occurred in 11.8
and 15.6% of the patients, gastrointestinal bleeding in 7.8 vs.
9.4%, and cerebral hemorrhage in 2.9 vs. 3.1%, respectively, in
the experimental and control arms.
Concurrently the aforementioned phase III study, an
international compassionate use program (CUP) (17), has
been implemented, aimed to ensure drug supply to a wider
range of transplant centers across the world. Transplant
centers adhering to the CUP program enrolled patients
developing severe VOD/SOS either after HSCT or after
radiotherapy/chemotherapy. Both the Baltimore- and Seattle￾modified (6, 44) diagnosis criteria were used; when the Seattle
criteria were not met, the presence of US changes or histological
diagnosis could be sufficient for patient recruitment and drug
supply. Severe VOD/SOS was defined by the presence of MOD or
by >30% of predicted risk retrospectively evaluated according to
the Bearman model (96). Defibrotide doses ranged from 10 to 80
mg/kg, because no specific treatment protocol has been adopted.
Participating centers voluntarily provided demographic and
clinical data for the analysis. Overall 1,169 patients received at
least one dose of defibrotide, whereas data were finally retrieved
on 710 patients. Six hundred eighty-nine of 710 patients
developed VOD/SOS after HSCT: 499 after an allogeneic HSCT,
and 112 after autologous HSCT; 60% were transplanted for
acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and 57% of the study population
was adults (≥18 years old). Two hundred ninety-two of 710
patients were treated for a severe VOD/SOS. One hundred-day
survival was 54% in the overall population (58% of those patients
receiving defibrotide at the dose of 25 mg/kg) and was higher in
the pediatric cohort (65.4 vs. 46.1%), in the group without MOD
(64.7 vs. 39.7%), and in patients developing VOD/SOS after a
non-HSCT therapy (74.2 vs. 67.5%). Adverse events occurred
in 51% of patients, whereas overall discontinuation of the drug
occurred in 28%; 9% of patients discontinued defibrotide because
of AEs, mainly hemorrhages (gastrointestinal). No clinically
meaningful trends in AE occurrence were identified by gender,
age, or dose group.
The third study was a prospective open-label, single-arm study
in an expanded access program (16) enrolling, from 2007 to
2016, patients with hepatic VOD/SOS, both post-HSCT and
non-HSCT treatments, with the aim to evaluate 100-day overall
survival (primary endpoint) and safety of defibrotide given at
the dose of 25 mg/kg for at least 21 days. The inclusion criteria
changed over time: initially, VOD/SOS should be diagnosed
according to the Baltimore criteria by day +35 post-HSCT or
by biopsy as well as MOD (by day +45 post-HSCT); then,
VOD/SOS was diagnosed based on Seattle criteria, with onset
after day +35, secondary to non-transplant treatment, also
including VOD/SOS without MOD. A total number of 1,137
patients were enrolled, 1,000 with VOD/SOS after HSCT (85%
allogeneic HSCT and 15% autologous HSCT). The pediatric
group represented 82% of postautologous HSCT VOD/SOS and
52.3% of postallogeneic HSCT VOD/SOS. One hundred-day
overall survival was 58.9% in the whole population, 68.5% in
patients who developed VOD/SOS without MOD, and 49.5%
in patients with MOD; VOD/SOS was significantly associated
with MOD occurrence in all transplant types and all age groups.
Late-onset VOD/SOS was more frequent in adults than in
children (39.3% of adult patients and 16.7% of children) and was
associated with lower survival only in the pediatric group. Earlier
initiation of defibrotide treatment was significantly associated
with higher day +100 survival (P < 0.001). Treatment-emergent
AEs (in patients who received at least one dose of defibrotide)
were more frequent in adults than in children (77.9 and
65.5%, respectively) and in patients with MOD (75.2% overall,
81% in adults, and 70.5% in children). Twenty-one percent of
patients had at least one treatment-related AE (TRAE), which
represented the reason for treatment discontinuation in 12.4%
of patients. Treatment-related AEs were not different according
in relation to VOD/SOS time of onset. The most important
TRAEs were pulmonary hemorrhage (4.6%), gastrointestinal
hemorrhage (3.0%), epistaxis (2.3%), and hypotension (2.0%).
A postmarketing phase IV study on defibrotide has been
required by French regulatory authorities as a source of real￾world data (48). Patients treated with defibrotide as prophylaxis
were included, although there is no registration of defibrotide for
this indication. In this study, VOD/SOS diagnosis was performed
according to the EBMT criteria and the primary endpoints were
both 100-day survival and 100-day complete response of severe
VOD/SOS. Three hundred twenty-four French patients received
defibrotide from July 2014 to October 2018; 40 developed severe
VOD/SOS, and 120 after HSCT; overall, 105 patients developed a
severe/very severe VOD/SOS (89 after HSCT). More than 30%
of patients with VOD/SOS showed a concomitant MOD. One
hundred-day survival in the overall population (140 patients), in
severe VOD/SOS, and in very severe VOD/SOS were 58%, 79%,
and 34%, respectively. The proportion of patients experiencing
any AEs was 54% in the overall population. The study is still
active, and definitive data are forthcoming.
Data from these important studies are quite superimposable
and further confirmed by a systematic review of the literature,
which found out 100-day survival of 41% in patients with MOD
and 71% in those without MOD (97).
Corticosteroids, which have been used both in adult
(98) and pediatric (99) setting, achieved the 2C level of
recommendation in British guidelines (100); their use should
be cautiously considered because of the increased risk of

infections. Tissue plasminogen activator and N-acetylcysteine are
not recommended for increased bleeding risk and lack of efficacy,
respectively (100).
In case of no response and progression of VOD/SOS, the
prognosis is dismal, and few further treatments are available,
with limited efficacy. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic
shunting placement has been reported in few anecdotal cases
in literature for the treatment of VOD/SOS, but currently its
use is not recommended because of poor outcomes (101). It has
been considered sometimes when a severe VOD/SOS refractory
to medical treatment occurred in a liver transplant recipient
(102). Similarly, the role of orthotopic liver transplantation is
controversial; its use has been described in few case reports in
patients with severe VOD/SOS associated with life-threatening
liver failure (103).
PROPHYLAXIS
Several pharmacological approaches have been tested
with the purpose of preventing VOD/SOS, including
heparin, antithrombin, prostaglandin E1, pentoxifylline,
and ursodeoxycholic acid (9, 96). All these agents showed little
or no efficacy or caused intolerable rates of adverse effects for
a prophylactic strategy apart from ursodeoxycholic acid, which
is recommended by British guidelines (100). Unfractionated
heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin have been extensively
studied, including some randomized trials, but with inconclusive
results (12, 104–108). No efficacy was demonstrated for
antithrombin and pentoxifylline (109–111). Also, the use of
prostaglandin E1 was abandoned because of inconclusive results
and excess of toxicity (112–114). The use of ursodeoxycholic
acid (UDCA) in VOD/SOS prophylaxis has been investigated,
in comparison to placebo, in three different randomized trials.
Two of them (115, 116) demonstrated a significant reduction
of VOD/SOS incidence in the UDCA arm; one revealed no
differences between the two arms (117). A meta-analysis of
the three trials comparing UDCA with placebo supported the
use of UDCA as a possible effective prevention strategy, also
because of its safety profile (118). Another randomized study
compared prophylactic use of UDCA in association with heparin
against heparin alone and revealed no differences in VOD/SOS
incidence between the two groups (119).
The use of defibrotide as prophylactic agent has been tested
in several retrospective studies (120–122) and in one prospective
randomized trial in the pediatric setting. This phase III,
randomized, open-label, multicenter trial compared defibrotide
to placebo as VOD/SOS prophylaxis in pediatric patients
undergoing allogeneic or autologous HSCT (7). In this study,
each patient had one or more VOD/SOS risk factor including
preexisting hepatic disease, second myeloablative transplant,
allogeneic transplant for leukemia beyond second relapse,
conditioning with busulfan and melphalan, prior treatment
with gemtuzumab ozogamicin or a diagnosis of primary
hemophagocytic lymph histiocytosis, adrenoleukodystrophy, or
osteopetrosis. The trial included 365 patients younger than 18
years equally allocated in two arms. Patients in the treatment
group received defibrotide (DF) 25 mg/kg per day in four divided
intravenous infusions, starting with the initiation of conditioning
regimen and continuing for 30 days after transplantation or, if
discharged from hospital before 30 days after HSCT, for at least
14 days. The primary endpoint was the incidence of VOD by 30
days after HSCT. Twenty-two patients (12%) in the DF group
developed VOD/SOS compared with 35 patients (20%) in the
control group (Z-test for competing risk analysis P = 0.0488;
log-rank test P = 0.0507).
Based on these results, the British Committee for Standards
in Hematology and the British Society for Blood and Marrow
Transplantation guidelines recommend the use of defibrotide
for VOD/SOS prophylaxis in children undergoing HSCT with at
least one risk factor for VOD/SOS (evidence IA) (100).
In adults, evidences are far less conclusive, and consistent
results from randomized trials are still lacking. Even if some
retrospective studies suggest a possible role of defibrotide for
prophylaxis of VOD/SOS, particularly in high-risk patients,
there is no clear evidence of its efficacy (123–125). There is
no physiological reason why defibrotide should not work for
VOD/SOS prophylaxis in adult, but it is yet to be proved if a
prophylactic strategy would grant a better outcome than an early
treatment strategy. A prospective randomized trial is ongoing,
aimed to clarify these issues (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02851407).
CONCLUSIONS
Diagnosis of VOD/SOS is currently based mainly on clinical
criteria; biomarkers for VOD/SOS diagnosis are not yet validated.
The most reliable imaging method supporting VOD/SOS
diagnosis is US, which is now recognized as an essential diagnosis
criterion of late-onset VOD/SOS and highly recommended
to assess hepatomegaly and ascites in children. Nevertheless,
VOD/SOS diagnosis remains difficult in real-life setting, despite
the availability of different diagnostic criteria systems; differential
diagnosis is quite challenging because several other conditions
could meet the VOD/SOS criteria, such as sepsis, cholangitis
lenta, constrictive pericarditis, hepatic GvHD, hepatitis, or DILI.
Moreover, more than one complication can occur simultaneously
in the same patient leading to a substantial delay of final
diagnosis. When clinical criteria are not fully met, invasive
diagnostic methods are still hard to be widely used because they
need well-trained multidisciplinary teams to perform and read
biopsy or HVPG measurement. Even in the presence of these
facilities, however, patients with suspicious or proven VOD/SOS
can be critically instable, and the risk of further severe procedure￾related complications cannot be prevented.
For these reasons additional tools for the diagnosis are most
welcome. Elastometry is a non-invasive method to perform LSM,
which is a validated surrogate of HVPG, in advanced chronic
liver disease. If ongoing studies confirm the role of elastometry
in HSCT patients, this non-invasive imaging technique will
allow an earlier VOD/SOS diagnosis and an accurate monitoring
of treatment response. The use of elastometry underpinned
the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to VOD/SOS
with specialists in radiology, hepatology, intensive care, and

nephrology supporting and helping physicians performing HSCT
in the management of VOD/SOS. Anyway, the use of elastometry
for VOD/SOS diagnosis and for treatment response evaluation
deserves further validation by prospective studies.
In the past, the mortality risk for patients who develop
posttransplant VOD/SOS with MOD, typically characterized
by pulmonary and/or renal dysfunction, has been estimated
to be >80% (8–10). In more recent reports, mortality rates
are significantly lower: 22 and 35% at 100 days and 5 years,
respectively, in the retrospective large Italian pediatric cohort
(47), and 49.5% estimated survival at 100 days in the T-IND
study (16).
Decreased mortality can be attributed to a better intensive
care, to increasing proportion of centers with multidisciplinary
teams, to a wider use of risk stratification, to earlier treatment.
Prevention of MOD occurrence and progression of severity
grading significantly increased survival in all HSCT transplants
settings (16, 49). Finally, a greater knowledge on risk factors
will lead to a more tailored approach to both prevention and
treatment of VOD/SOS.
