A B S T R A C T Renal micropuncture and clearance ex￾periments were carried out in rats to study the effect
of parathyroid hormone (PTH) on renal tubular HCO￾reabsorption. The rats were studied during an initial
period of parathyroid deficiency (acute thyroidpara￾thyroidectomy, TPTX) and during infusion of large
amounts of bovine PTH. Under normal acid-base
conditions, PTH administration to TPTX rats caused
a significant rise in proximal tubular fluid HCO3
concentration (TFHco-), a decrease in fluid reabsorp￾tion, and a fall in proximal HCO- reabsorption from
94.0 to 88.2% (P < 0.01). In control experiments with
mannitol infusion, a comparable reduction in proximal
fluid reabsorption occurred without any significant
effect on intraluminal HCO- concentration. During
acute intravenous HCO- loading, PTH inhibited
proximal HCO- reabsorption. However, no change in
whole kidney HCO- reabsorption was observed in these
experiments or in the animals studied under normal
acid-base conditions. The findings are consistent with
the view that PTH inhibits proximal tubular HCO-3
reabsorption with normal or high filtered loads of
HCO-, but distal segments of the nephron are able to
reabsorb the excess delivered from the proximal
tubule. Measurements of urinary ammonium and
titratable acid indicate that net acid excretion
(NH+ + TA - HCO) increases significantly after
PTH administration. These results do not provide
support for the view that PTH excess causes metabolic
acidosis by reducing renal acid excretion.
INTRODUCTION
A number of studies have suggested that parathyroid
hormone (PTH)l influences bicarbonate reabsorption

by the renal tubules (1-9). Infusion of purified para￾thyroid extract into intact dogs under normal acid￾base conditions causes a transient rise in urinary
bicarbonate excretion (7), and when infused into para￾thyroidectomized bicarbonate-loaded animals, a sus￾tained reduction in tubular reabsorption of bicarbonate
results (7-9). These effects were shown to be indepen￾dent of changes in renal hemodynamics, extracellular
volume, ultrafilterable calcium, and calcitonin (7-9).
From these observations, it could be concluded that
PTH has little or no significant effect on the bicarbonate
reabsorptive mechanism when the filtered load of bi￾carbonate is normal or low, but that the hormone in￾hibits reabsorption when the filtered bicarbonate level
is abnormally high. Such a conclusion could have im￾portant implications with regard to the underlying
mechanism of action of PTH on bicarbonate reabsorp￾tion. For example, inhibition of renal carbonic an￾hydrase activity with acetazolamide reduces bicarbon￾ate reabsorption over a wide range of filtered
bicarbonate concentrations, even when the filtered
load is quite low (10, 11). Furthermore, if PTH inhibits
bicarbonate reabsorption only when the filtered bi￾carbonate concentration is high, it would be unlikely
that excess endogenous parathyroid secretion can pro￾duce metabolic acidosis, as has been suggested for
several different clinical conditions (5, 6, 12).
The present experiments were carried out to gain
further information about the effect of PTH on renal
tubular reabsorption of bicarbonate. Micropuncture
measurements of proximal tubular bicarbonate transfer
were made in thyroidparathyroidectomized (TPTX)
rats before and after administration of exogenous PTH,
under normal acid-base conditions and during acute
bicarbonate loading. We found that PTH caused a
moderate reduction in proximal bicarbonate reabsorp￾single nephron glomerular filtration rate; TF/P1., tubular
fluid/plasma inulin ratio; TFHCo-, tubular fluid HCOT;
TPTX, thyroidparathyroidectomy.

tion in TPTX rats, whether the filtered load of bi￾carbonate was normal or elevated. Whole kidney
bicarbonate reabsorption was unaltered, however,
under these experimental conditions. These observa￾tions suggest that distal segments of the nephron are
not inhibited by PTH, and were able to reabsorb the
excess bicarbonate rejected by the proximal tubules.
Net acid excretion increased after PTH, as a result of a
rise in titratable acid and ammonium excretion. The
observations do not provide support for the view that
PTH excess causes metabolic acidosis.
METHODS
White male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 225-335 g were
maintained on a regular rat pellet diet and given 5% sucrose
drinking solution ad lib. for at least 4 days before the day
of the experiment to insure adequate hydration. Food, but
not drinking solution, was withheld on the night before the
experiment. On the day of the experiment, anesthesia was
induced with i.p. Inactin, 10 mg/100 g body weight. The
trachea was cannulated, and PE 50 tubing was inserted into a
jugular vein for administration of i.v. fluids. A second PE 50
tubing was inserted into the same vein for pulse injectioni of
FD & C green no. 3 dye (Keystone Anilinie and Chemical
Co., Chicago, 111.). A carotid artery was cannulated with
heparinized PE 50 tubing conniected to a Statham strain
gauge, model P 23 Dc (Statham Instrumenits Div., Gould
Inc., Oxnard, Calif.), for continuous recording of blood pres￾sure by a Grass polygraph, model 5D (Grass Instrument Co.,
Quincy, Mass.). In all experiments, total TPTX was carried
out as soon as the jugular and carotid vessel surgery had been
completed. A volume of Ringer's lactate solution equal to 1%
of body weight was given i.v. over a 1-2-min period, followed
by one of the i.v. solutions described below.
The left kidney was exposed through a small lateral ab￾dominal inlcisioIn, dissected free of perirenal adipose tissue,
and placed in a Lucite cup attached to the animal table.
The kidniey was immobilized by silicone grease (Dow Corninlg
Corp., Midland, Mich.) and cottoni packed between it and
the kidney cup. Mineral oil warmed to 37-38°C flowed coIn￾tinuously over the kidney. A fiber optic light system was used
to illuminate the kidney surface, which was viewed through
a stereomicroscope at X 150 magniificationi. The urinary
bladder was externalized through a smallsuprapubic inicisionl,
and PE tubing, flanged at the tip, was inserted into the lumen
and ligated in a mannier which eliminiated bladder dead space.
Body temperature of the rat was monitored continiuously via
a rectal thermistor and a telethermometer (Yellow Sprinigs
Instrument Co., Y'ellow Sprinigs, Ohio) and was mainitailned
at 37-38°C by adjusting the voltage of a 40-X\V bulb under the
animal table. Further details of the methods are given in the
individual protocols described below.
Effect of parathyroid extract under hydropenic, normal acid￾base conditions. In nine rats, a continuous infusion of
Ringer's lactate solution was given i.v. throughout the experi￾ment at 50 jAl/min. A 30-;tCi prime of [carboxyl-14C1inulin
(New England Nuclear, Boston, Mass.) was given and an
amount added to the infusion to deliver 30,sCi/h. Tubular
fluid collections were begun approximately 30-45min later,
35-90 min after TPTX. The last surface convolution of
proximal convoluted tubules was selected formicropuncture
by three criteria: contiguity to a vascular"star"; sequential
appearance of i.v. pulse-injected FD & C green dye; disap￾pearance beneath the kidney surface of oil droplets injected

into the tubular lumneni, anid failure of the droplets to reappear
in other convolutions. Two tubular fluid collections were made
from each of the selected end-proximal convolutions. The
first was made into a micropipet filled with Sudani black￾colored castor oil, by previously described techniiques (13, 14).
The tubule distal to the collection site was blocked by a large
column of the oil, injected before startinig the tubular fluid
collection. The collection was made at a rate which main￾tainied the oil block in a constanit positioni, by adjustillg the
level of a mercury bulb connected to the micropipet. The
collection was timed with a stopwatch. This first samiiple was
used to measure[E4C]inulin1 concenitrationi anid single nephroln
glomerular filtration rate (SNGFR) (see below). After this
collection had been completed, the tubule was repuinctured,
either slightly proximal to the first hole or through the same
hole, with a pipet of larger tip diamiieter to prevent leakage of
tubular fluid around the pipet. This second pipet containied
a quinhydronie microelectrode. The nmethod for preparation
of the quinhydronie electrodes has been described previously
(13-15). The pipet was filled with Sudan black-stainiedmineral
oil that had been continuously bubbled with 5%, CO2. If the
oil column from the first tubular fluid collection wasno longer
visible, additional oil was injected into the lumeni. The rate of
tubular fluid collection was againi adjusted to maintain the
oil column in a constanit position. This second collection was
continued until tubular fluid fully surrounlded the micro￾electrode. The pipet was then withdrawni from the tubule and
the tip of the pipet immediately sealed with 3M KCI-agar.
Effect of Parathyroid Hormone on Renal Bicarbonate Reabsorption 337

After 5 min, the potential of the qtuinihydronie electrode was
measured at 37°C against a standard calomel electrode in
3 M KCl bubbled with 5%/(, C02, using a model 25 Radiometer
pH meter (London Co., Cleveland, Ohio). A standard curve
was established on the day of each experiment with isotonic
saline solutionis containing 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10 mmol/liter bicar￾bonate, using individual quinhydrone electrodes. In each case,
the measurement was made consistently at 5 min after the
pipet tip had been sealed with the KCI-agar. The bicarbonate
concentrations in the tubular fluid were determined from the
HCO_, vs. millivolt plot of the standard solutions. Pre￾liminary tests of the accuracy and reproducibility of bi￾carbonate determinations with quinhydrone microelectrodes
were carried out, using the standard solutionis. The results of
measurements with 48 microelectrodes are shown in Fig. 1.
They indicate that these microelectrodes can determine
HCO_ concentrations reliably in this range within i0.3
mmol/liter.
After two or three end-proximal tubules had been sampled
in each rat, 16 U purified bovine PTH (The Wilson Lab￾oratories, Chicago, Ill.) was given i.v. and an amount of
hormone was added to the i.v. infusioni to deliver 16 U/h
continuously for the second period of the experiment. Starting
approximately 10 min later, additional end-proximal convolu￾tions were punctured twice by the same techniques used in the
first period. These were "fresh" tubules, not the same ones
sampled during the first period. Timed urine collections were
obtained from the urinary bladder before and after PTH
administration . Effect of continuing hypoparathyroid state under hydropenic,
normal acid-base conditions. Six additional rats were pre￾pared by exactly the same techniques described above. After
TPTX, they were given a continuous infusion of Ringer's
lactate solution at 50,ul/min. Tubular fluid and urine collec￾tions were made over a total time period which matched that
of the preceding group of animals. However, no PTH was
given to these six rats. For analysis of the data in this group,
the experiment was arbitrarily divided into two halves, to
correspond in time to the two periods of the preceding group
of animals.
Effect of mannitol on proximal bicarbonate reabsorption.
Since PTH administration is knowni to reduce fluid reabsorp￾tion in the proximal tubule (16-18), the effect on bicarbonate
of inhibitioni of fluid reabsorption by ani agent other than PTH
was studied. For this purpose, mannlitol was infused in seven
additional rats. The rats were prepared in the same way
described in the preceding sections, includinig TPTX. Tubular
fluid and urine samples were collected in the first period during
i.v. Ringer's lactate infusion at 50 ,ul/min. At the end of this
period, 0.7 ml of 2% mannitol in Ringer's solution was given
i.v. and 2%/, mannitol was added to the i.v. infusion, which
was continued at 50 ,ul/min for the remainder of the experi￾ment. 5-10 min after the mannitol had been started, additional
tubular fluid and urine samples were collected.
Effect of PTH on bicarbonate reabsorption during acute bi￾carbonate loading. In nine rats, bicarbonate reabsorption by
the proximal tubules was measured during progressive eleva￾tion of serum bicarbonate concentration, in an initial hypo￾parathyroid period and after administration of PTH. The
rats were prepared for the experiment as described in the first
section, including TPTX. After the surgery was completed,
an i.v. infusion of NaHCO3, 750 mmol/liter, was started at
50,ul/min. The intention of the slow infusioin of this hypertonic
solutioni was to raise serum bicarbonate concentration pro￾gressively without markedly expanding extracellular fluid
volume (19-21). Approximately 10 min after the infusion had
been started, end-proximal convolutions were selected and
punctured twice for inulin and bicarbonate measurements,
as described in the first section. In six of the nine rats, after
two or three tubules had been sampled, 16 U PTH was given
i.v. as a prime and an amount of hormone added to the infu￾sion to deliver 16 U/h throughout the remainder of the experi￾ment. Additional tubular fluid and urine collections were then
obtained. In the other three rats, PTH was not given, but
tubular fluid samples were collected over a total period of
time that corresponded to the other six experiments.
In all experiments, the volume of tubular fluid collected
for [i4C]inulin measurement was determined by transferring
the sample into a constanit-bore capillary tube (0.1-mm
internal diameter) (Corning Glass Works, Science Products
Div., Corning, N. Y.) and measuring the length of the column
under a microscope with an eyepiece micrometer (22). The
sample was then washed out of the capillary tube into liquid
scintillation counting vials containing 15 ml counting solu￾tion: 100 ml Bio-Solv (Beckman Instruments, Inc., Fullerton,
Calif.) 42 ml Liquifluor (New England Nuclear, Boston,
Mass.) made up to 1,000 ml with scintillation-grade toluene
(Fisher Scientific Co., Pittsburgh, Pa.). Radioactive counts
were measured with a Nuclear-Chicago liquid scintillation
counter Unilux II A (Amersham/Searle Corp., Arlington
Heights, lll.). Portions of plasma, obtained from arterialized
blood collected from the cut end of the tail in heparinized
capillary tubes at 30-min intervals, were analyzed for
[i4C]inulin concentration by the same methods. The plasma
inulin concentration was corrected for a plasma water content
of 94%. The plasma inulin concentration at the midpoint of
each tubular fluid collection was calculated from a time plot,
and this concentration was used to calculate the tubular
fluid/plasma inulin ratio (TF/Pi.). SNGFR was calculated
from the expression:
SNGFR = TF/Pi. X TFR,
where TFR is the tubular fluid flow rate in nanoliters per
minute.
Arterial blood samples were collected periodically from the
carotid artery catheter for measurement of pH, total C02,
and phosphorus using methods described previously (14, 15,
23). Serum calcium was measured by the method of Meites
(24). Plasma HCO concentrations at the midpoint of tubular
fluid and urine collections were obtained from a time plot,
and these values used to calculate tubular fluid/plasma
HCO (TF/PHCo,) ratios and filtered load of bicarbonate for
single nephrons and the whole kidney. Timed urine collections
from the urinary bladder were analyzed for the same con￾stituents, as well as for [14C]inulin. Glomerular filtrate rate
(GFR) for the two kidneys was calculated from the expression:
GFR = U/PI1 X V,
where U/Pi. is the ratio of inulin in the urine vs. plasma, and
V is the urine flow rate in milliliters per minute. In all experi￾ments, the excreted fractioni of phosphorus (EFp) was used
as the criterion for the adequacy of the parathyroidectomy
(EFp < 1%) and for the biologic activity of the administered
PTH (EFp > 5%).
Per cent reabsorption of bicarbonate by the proximal tubule
was calculated as
[1 - (TF/PHco- X P/TF1,)] X 100.
Absolute rate of bicarbonate reabsorption was calculated for
each tubule by the following:
THCO3 = SNGFR X PHco-/nl [% HCO reab.].

Effect of PTH on urinary ammonium and titratable acid
excretion. In four rats, urinary excretion of ammonium and
titratable acid was measured during an initial hypoparathyroid
period, and during administration of PTH. In this group,
food was not withheld on the night before the experiment.
The rats were prepared surgically by the same techniques
described for the first group of animals except that abdominal
surgery and isolation of one kidney for micropuncture was
omitted. The urinary bladder was exposed and catheterized
as described above. Starting approximately 60 min after
TPTX, two timed urine collections were obtained under oi
in preweighed tubes. PTH was then administered i.v., as in
the preceding experiments, and two additional timed urine
collections were obtained. Each urine sample was analyzed
for pH, CO2 content, ammonium (25), and titratable acid
(26). The values in individual animals were averaged before
and after PTH administration and analyzed statistically by
paired t test.
RESULTS
Table I shows the plasma acid-base and calcium values
for the three groups of hydropenic rats. As can be seen,
there were no significant changes in plasma HCO3
concentrations between the first and second periods of
the experiments. In all three groups, Pco2 fell and pH
rose during the second half of the experiment, but this
achieved statistical significance only in the mannitol
group. The reason for the tendency toward hyper￾ventilation is probably decreasing levels of anesthesia.
Serum calcium concentration increased significantly
during PTH administration (P < 0.01) but remained
constant in the other two groups of animals.

animals, EFp was < 1% during TPTX periods, indicat
ing successful total parathyroidectomy. In group I,
administration of PTH caused a significant increase in
urine flow rate (V) and phosphorus excretion. There was
no significant effect on urinary pH or bicarbonate
excretion, however. GFR remained constant through￾out the experiment. During prolonged TPTX (group
II), all measured electrolytes and GFR remained un￾changed throughout the experiment. In the group
given mannitol, urine flow increased significantly,
whereas electrolyte excretion and GFR showed no
statistically significant changes.
The data on SNGFR measurements in the same
three groups of rats are shown in Fig. 2. All measure￾ments in individual animals were averaged for each

nitol was administered in the second period of the
experiment, there was no significant change in SNGFR
(P > 0.5). The reason for the decline in SNGFR with
prolonged parathyroid deficiency is not clear. However,
we noted that blood pressure frequently declined
gradually in this group of animals, and this could have
been responsible for the fall in surface SNGFR, as well
as the small decrease in GFR (Table II). Experiments
were terminated if the mean blood pressure fell below
110 mm Hg.
Fig. 3 shows TF/PI, measured in the last accessible
proximal convolutions, for the same three groups of
rats. As in Fig. 1, the values for each period in each
animal have been averaged, and the averages for in￾dividual animals are presented. In the six rats studied
during prolonged parathyroid deficiency (left panel),
TF/Pjn either remained constant or rose as the experi￾ment progressed. The mean value of 3.36 in the second
period was not significantly different from the mean
value of the first period, 2.98 (P > 0.3). In contrast,
in eight of the nine rats given PTH, TF/PIn fell signif￾icantly from 3.04 to 2.46±0.15 SED (P < 0.01). This
indicates that a reduction in fractional reabsorption of
fluid occurred with the administration of PTH. Since
SNGFR was relatively constant in this group of
animals, absolute proximal fluid absorption also fell
as a result of PTH administration. These observations
are in agreement with those of others that PTH
reduces fluid reabsorption in the proximal tubule of
the dog (16, 17) and rat (18). In the seven rats given
mannitol, TF/P10 fell from 2.92 to 2.37±0.07 SED
(P < 0.001). Proximal fluid reabsorption was thus
reduced in both fractional and absolute amounts.
In Fig. 4 are plotted the mean free-flow end-proximal
tubular fluid HCO (TFHCO-) concentrations for the
same three groups of rats, measured with quinhydrone

to 6.0 mmol/liter in the first period (mean 4.3). There
was no significant change throughout the period of
observation, the mean value being 4.2 mmol/liter in
the second period (P > 0.5). In sharp contrast, in the
rats given PTH, TFHCO3 rose from 3.6 to 5.1 mmol/
liter +0.4 SED (P < 0.02). The seven animals given
mannitol showed no significant change in TFHCO3-
the mean being 3.9 mmol/liter before mannitol and 4.0
mmol/liter after mannitol ±0.2 SED (P > 0.5).
Fig. 5 shows the calculated end-proximal fractional
HCO3 reabsorption for the same three groups of rats.
No significant change in percent HCO3 reabsorption
occurred in the rats observed during prolonged para￾thyroid deficiency, 90.5 vs. 91.5%o +0.9 SED (P>0.3).
PTH administration caused a significant reduction in
percent HCO3 reabsorption in eight of the nine rats,
the mean value falling from 94.0 to 88.2%o i 1.2 SED
(P < 0.01). Mannitol infusion caused a small decrease
in fractional HCO3 reabsorption from 94 to 92.3%o
+0.5 SED (P < 0.05).
The results of the acute i.v. bicarbonate loading
experiments are shown in Figs. 6 and 7. Fig. 6 plots
whole kidney HCO3 reabsorption, on the ordinate,
against the corresponding plasma HCO3 concentration,
during parathyroid deficiency (0) and during PTH
administration (0*). In the six rats that received PTH,
whole kidney GFR was 13.7 ml/min per kg before
hormone administration and 12.5 ml/min per kg
+1.3 SED after hormone administration (P > 0.3).
In the other three rats, which remained parathyroid
deficient throughout the experiment, there was also no
tendency for GFR to change during the course of the
bicarbonate infusion. It is clear that under the two
hormonal conditions, renal HCO3 reabsorption rose
progressively, with no evidence for a tubular maximal.
Purkerson and co-workers (19) observed in normal rats
a similar linear increase in tubular HCO3 reabsorption
if extracellular volume expansion is avoided. As shown

plotted in Fig. 7. As in the case of the whole kidney
data, the single nephron HCO- reabsorption values
have been "normalized" for differences in SNGFR. In
the six rats that received PTH, SNGFR was 44.9
nl/min before hormone administration and 42.7 nl/min
±2.5 SED after hormone administration (P > 0.5).
Similarly, no significant changes in SNGFR occurred
in the three rats that remained parathyroid deficient
throughout the experiment. The mean TF/Pi. ratio
was 2.83 before PTH administration and fell to 2.44
±40.10 SED after PTH administration (P < 0.01). As
shown in Fig. 7, with i.v. HCO- loading, proximal
HCO reabsorption rose linearly, with no evidence of
a maximum rate. In sharp contrast to the whole kidney
data, however, PTH administration significantly re￾duced proximal tubular HCO reabsorption. The linear
regression line for the hypoparathyroid data is y=0.08x
-0.23 (P < 0.001) and for the period during PTH
administration is y = 0.09x - 1.25 (P < 0.05). The
slopes of the two regression lines are not different from
one another, but the intercept of the TPTX + PTH
values is significantly lower than the TPTX values
(P <0.01). Thus, under conditions of acute bicarbonate
loading, PTH reduced HCO reabsorption in the proxi￾mal convoluted tubule, but not by the whole kidney.
The effect of PTH administration on urinary am￾monium and titratable acid excretion was studied in
four rats. These animals were not fasted overnight,
and had no abdominal surgery other than a suprapubic
incision to externalize the urinary bladder. Plasma
HCO concentration was between 22.0 and 25.5 mmol/
liter during the clearance measurements. The results
are shown in Table III. As can be seen, titratable acid
excretion increased markedly after PTH administra￾tion (P < 0.02), presumably because of the increase
in phosphate in the urine. Ammonium excretion also
increased significantly, and this was accompanied by
a fall in urine pH from 6.37 to 5.95±0.07 SED
(P = 0.01). There was no significant change in bi￾carbonate excretion. Net acid excretion (NH+ + TA
-HCO) increased from 1.07 ,eq/min per kg to 5.48
,ueq/min per kg after PTH administration.
DISCUSSION
The results of the present study demonstrate that
acute administration of bovine PTH to TPTX non￾expanded rats produces a small but significant reduc￾tion in HCO- reabsorption by the proximal tubule.
This was demonstrable in animals with serum HCO3
concentrations ranging from 18 to 40 mmol/liter. The
reduction in reabsorption was the result of a combina￾tion of a decrease in fluid absorption (TF/P10) and a
rise in the concentration of HCO- in the proximal
tubular fluid (TFHCo-). The rise TFHco- suggests that
the mechanism of HCO inhibition was not simply
retention of water in the tubular lumen, since inhibi￾tion of proximal fluid absorption by mannitol did not
result in any significant change in TFHCO-. Several
other possibilities can be considered. PTH might have
inhibited active H+ secretion via some effect on intra￾cellular pH or carbonic anhydrase. If H+ secretion is
dependent upon active sodium transport, the hormone
might have reduced H+ secretion by inhibiting Na+
transport. Finally, PTH might have increased the back
diffusion of HCO, as well as sodium, from plasma into
the lumen by increasing the permeability of the inter￾cellular tight junctions. The observations do not
distinguish among these various possibilities.
The mechanism of the effect of mannitol on HCO3
reabsorption is probably complex. The osmotic effect
in the lumen would be expected to cause a fall in
TFHCO , as well as other electrolytes. On the other hand,
mannitol could exert a solvent drag effect across the
tubular epithelium which might return HCO- to the
tubular lumen from the intercellular spaces, where it is
presumably present in high concentrations. This would
tend to counteract the dilutional effect of the mannitol
on luminal concentrations. Our findings are in fact
consistent with such a combination of effects, since no
change in TFHCO3- was found in spite of a significant
decrease in fluid absorption. The small decrease in
proximal HCO reabsorption with mannitol was
directly proportional to the decrease in water reabsorp￾tion. No significant changes in either TF/Pin or TFHCO3
occurred in those experiments in which neither PTH
342 N. Bank and H. Aynediian

nor mannitol was given. This tends to exclude possible
uncontrolled effects on HCO- reabsorption, such as
volume expansion and systemic acid-base changes
occurring during the course of the experiments.
One possible theoretical explanation for the rise in
TFHCO3 concentration after PTH administration is
generation of HCO- in the tubular lumen due to a
rise in luminal phosphate concentration. Inhibition of
phosphate reabsorption by PTH might result in genera￾tion of intraluminal HCO by the reaction
H2CO3 + HPO= -* HCO0+ H2PO4.
To quantitate the amount of HCO- to be expected
from this reaction, we measured total CO2 and pH of
four C02-equilibrated solutions, each containing NaCl
150 meq/liter and NaHCO3 5 meq/liter, but with 2, 4,
6, or 8 mmol/liter of Na2HPO4. We found that ap￾proximately 0.4 mmol HCO- is generated per millimole
phosphate. In the rats given PTH, TFHCO; increased
approximately 1.5 mmol/liter. Tubular fluid phosphate
concentration would have had to increase by about 4
mmol/liter after PTH to account for this rise in HCO . In a study by Kuntziger et al. (27), administration of
cyclic AMP to parathyroidectomized rats produced
only a 0.2 mmol rise in tubular fluid phosphate concen￾tration, as measured by electron microprobe analysis.
Thus, it seems unlikely that the effect of PTH on
proximal HCO can be accounted for entirely by
intraluminal generation of HCO via the above
reaction.
In spite of the inhibition of proximal HCO- re￾absorption by PTH, no significant increase in urinary
HCO excretion occurred in the hydropenic animals,
although there were definite increases in urine flow,
sodium, and phosphate excretion. We assume, there￾fore, that all of the excess HCO delivered out of the
proximal tubule was reabsorbed by more distal segments
of the nephron. It has been shown that the capacity
of the loop of Henle and distal tubule for HCO re￾absorption is normally highly unsaturated in the rat,
and that the rate of HCO reabsorption in these distal
segments increases markedly when there is spillover of
HCO from more proximal nephron sites (28, 29). In
fact, a comparison of the maximum rates of H+ secre￾tion and Na+ reabsorption in the rat distal tubule shows
that there is a considerably greater capacity for H+
secretion than Na+ reabsorption (29). The moderate
increases in sodium excretion without any increase in
the urine HCO flow rate observed after PTH might
be attributed, therefore, to proximal fluid inhibition
and unequal capacities for Na+ and H+ transport in
the distal nephron. Our observations do not exclude,
however, a distal inhibitory effect of PTH on sodium
reabsorption.
Several clearance studies on the effect of PTH on
bicarbonate excretion have been reported in dogs
(4, 7-9). The results differ in some respects from the
present observations in rats. In intact hydropenic dogs
studied under normal acid-base conditions, PTH in￾fusion causes a modest rise in urinary pH and HCO3
flow rate (4, 7), although the effect is only transient
(7). In TPTX dogs acutely loaded with bicarbonate,
PTH reduces whole kidney HCO- reabsorption from
an elevated level toward more normal levels, but not to
abnormally low values (7-9). Thus, in the dog, an
inhibitory effect of acute administration of PTH on
HCO- reabsorption can be observed for the whole
kidney. In contrast, in our rats the effect of PTH could
not be detected by clearance measurements, either
under normal acid-base conditions or acute HCO3
loading. The reason for this difference between rat
and dog is not clear, but might be due to a greater
capacity of the rat distal nephron to reabsorb HCO .
A number of authors have suggested that hyper￾parathyroidism (primary or secondary) might be
capable of reducing renal HCO reabsorption to
abnormally low rates, and thereby produce metabolic
acidosis (5, 6, 12). However, the results of the present
study, as well as studies in dogs (7-9), do not provide
support for this view. The results of clearance experi￾ments in dogs indicate that after TPTX, tubular bi￾carbonate reabsorptive capacity is enhanced and that
acute PTH administration reduces reabsorption only
to a normal level but not to lower than normal values
(7, 8). In the present study, not only did PTH fail to
increase bicarbonate excretion in the urine, it actually
increased net acid excretion (Table III) by producing
a rise in titratable acid and ammonium excretion. The
rise in titratable acid can be accounted for by the large
increase in phosphate excretion after PTH. The cause
of the acute increase in ammonium excretion is not
clear, but could be related to the significant fall in
urinary pH which occurred after PTH administration.
In none of the reported studies has PTH actually
lowered plasma HCO concentration to acidotic levels.
Therefore, the evidence thus far does not support the
view that acute changes in PTH levels play a direct
role in external acid-base balance. However, it is
possible that chronic hyperparathyroidism might
contribute to metabolic acidosis by an indirect mecha￾nism. Gold and co-workers (30) demonstrated that
chronic phosphate depletion, produced by a phosphate￾deficient diet over several months, can cause renal
bicarbonate wasting in dogs. They suggested that this
might be the cause of metabolic acidosis in chronic
hyperparathyroidism. Their animals were probably in
a hypoparathyroid state (30), however, and since no
studies were carried out in chronic hyperparathyroid
animals, further experiments are needed to test this
hypothesis.
