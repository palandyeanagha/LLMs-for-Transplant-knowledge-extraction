ABSTRACT
Background The incidence and outcomes of
respiratory viral infections in lung transplant recipients
(LTR) are not well defined. The objective of this
prospective study conducted from June 2008 to March
2011 was to characterise the incidence and outcomes of
viral respiratory infections in LTR.
Methods Patients were seen in three contexts: study￾specific screenings covering all seasons; routine post￾transplantation follow-up; and emergency visits.
Nasopharyngeal specimens were collected systematically
and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed when
clinically indicated. All specimens underwent testing with
a wide panel of molecular assays targeting respiratory
viruses.
Results One hundred and twelve LTR had 903
encounters: 570 (63%) were screening visits, 124 (14%)
were routine post-transplantation follow-up and 209
(23%) were emergency visits. Respiratory viruses were
identified in 174 encounters, 34 of these via BAL. The
incidence of infection was 0.83 per patient-year (95% CI
0.45 to 1.52). The viral infection rates upon screening,
routine and emergency visits were 14%, 15% and 34%,
respectively (p<0.001). Picornavirus was identified most
frequently in nasopharyngeal (85/140; 60.7%) and BAL
specimens (20/34; 59%). Asymptomatic viral carriage,
mainly of picornaviruses, was found at 10% of screening
visits. Infections were associated with transient lung
function loss and high calcineurin inhibitor blood levels.
The hospitalisation rate was 50% (95% CI 30% to
70.9%) for influenza and parainfluenza and 16.9%
(95% CI 11.2% to 23.9%) for other viruses. Acute
rejection was not associated with viral infection (OR 0.4,
95% CI 0.1 to 1.3).
Conclusions There is a high incidence of viral infection
in LTR; asymptomatic carriage is rare. Viral infections
contribute significantly to this population’s respiratory
symptomatology. No temporal association was observed
between infection and acute rejection.
INTRODUCTION
Influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), para￾influenza (PIV), human metapneumovirus (HMpV),
rhinovirus, enterovirus, coronavirus, human boca￾virus and adenovirus are the most frequent causes
of respiratory infections in humans. These viruses
circulate in the community with different seasonal
patterns and can lead to serious complications,
mainly in individuals with predisposing risk factors
such as immunosuppression or pre-existing lung
disease.1–5 Lung transplant recipients (LTR) are par￾ticularly prone to developing lower respiratory
tract infections. This is related to their immunosup￾pression and also to the exposure of the graft to
viral agents, impaired mucociliary function, altered
lymphatic drainage and the absence of a cough
reflex. These infections may have the potential to
promote secondary bacterial infections, acute rejec￾tion (AR) and subsequently lead to chronic graft
dysfunction.
The availability of highly sensitive diagnostic
panels targeting the nucleic acids of multiple
respiratory viruses now allows for the exploration
of the complex relationship between specific
respiratory viruses and clinical outcomes in LTR.
Previous investigations and a systematic review have
shown that viral infections detected by molecular
assays are associated with respiratory symptoms,
but their association with AR remains controver￾sial.6 7 Nonetheless, both the retrospective nature
of most studies and the difficulties in conducting a
complete panel of molecular assays in a standar￾dised manner allow for only weak inferences
regarding the role of viruses in this patient popula￾tion. The aims of our study were to investigate the

Key messages
What is the key question?
▸ The incidence, risk factors and clinical
outcomes of viral respiratory infections in lung
transplant recipients remain poorly defined.
What is the bottom line?
▸ Advances in molecular viral diagnostics bring
to light a high incidence of viral infections
among lung transplant recipients; most of
these are symptomatic and thus lead to more
frequent emergency visits and hospitalisations
as well as transiently decreased lung function.
Why read on?
▸ This large prospective study is the first to
systematically examine the epidemiology,
symptomatology and clinical outcomes of viral
respiratory infections as diagnosed in
lung-transplanted patients by means of highly
sensitive molecular assays.

incidence, risk factors, symptomatology and clinical outcome of
respiratory viral infections detected by molecular assays in LTR
and to search for an association between respiratory viral infec￾tions and biopsy-proven acute allograft rejection.
METHODS
Study population and procedures
Of 116 eligible LTR, we included 112 patients attending the
Centre Universitaire Romand de Transplantation, a Swiss trans￾plantation centre bridging two separate hospitals (University
Hospitals of Geneva, Geneva and the University Hospital of
Lausanne, Lausanne). All patients were followed from June
2008 to March 2011. Patient encounters comprised a scheduled
post-transplant visit (‘routine visit’) and unscheduled visits occa￾sioned by new symptoms or loss of lung function (‘emergency
visits’). As immunosuppressive medication can mask viral
respiratory symptoms, we further scheduled seven 6-week
screening periods covering all seasons over 2 years (‘screening
visit’) in order to capture infections that would not be reported
by LTR.
At each encounter, symptoms were recorded using study￾specific case report forms while viral screening was performed
on pooled nasopharyngeal and pharyngeal swabs collected by
specialised medical staff using the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention standardised procedure (http://www.cdc.gov/
pertussis/clinical/diagnostic-testing/specimen-collection.html). In
addition, at each routine or emergency visit, spirometry mea￾surements, blood tests, bronchoscopic procedures with bronch￾oalveolar lavage (BAL) and transbronchial biopsies (TBB) were
performed according to local guidelines.
Primary and secondary outcomes
The main outcome of the study was the incidence and distribu￾tion of viral respiratory infections among LTR. Secondary out￾comes included symptoms, hospitalisations, lung function
changes and AR attributed to viral infections. Lung function
changes between the pre-infection phase and infection were esti￾mated based on the comparison of the forced expiratory volume
in 1 s (FEV1) obtained during the 3 months prior to infection
and the FEV1 measured during infection. We considered mainly
biopsy-proven AR grade A2 or higher, as specific treatment is
controversial for lower grades.8
Viral PCR detection
Each upper or lower respiratory specimen was screened by
nucleic acid detection for the presence of influenza (A and B),
viruses belonging to the Paramyxoviridae family (RSV (A and
B), PIV (1–3)), HMpV, picornavirus (rhinovirus A, B and C,
enterovirus), coronavirus (229E, OC43, NL63, HKU1), human
bocavirus and adenovirus. At the taxonomic level, rhinoviruses
and enteroviruses are two species in the Enterovirus genus and
members of the human picornavirus family. As they are detected
by the same assay, we use the term ‘picornavirus’ when describ￾ing these viruses. Screening was performed using individual
two-step real-time TaqMan-based reverse transcriptase PCR
(RT-PCR) or PCR assays as described previously.6 9 In brief,
respiratory specimens were extracted using the HCV Amplicor
Specimen Preparation kit (Roche, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) for the
first year of the study and then Easymag (bioMérieux, Geneva,
Switzerland), according to the manufacturers’ recommendations.
Eight negative controls were introduced within each of the
96-well plates and inhibition was controlled by spiking each spe￾cimen with a quantified standard using canine distemper virus.
Experiments were validated only if the resulting cycling
threshold (CT) value was within expected ranges. PCR detection
was considered positive if duplicated by a second complete
experiment on an original aliquoted specimen and with a CT
value of ≤39.
Statistical methods
The incidence of viral infection was estimated with Stata V11
(Statacorp, College Station, Texas, USA) using the Poisson
routine. Incident rate ratios were estimated as categorical func￾tions of the post-transplant period and bronchiolitis obliterans
syndrome (BOS).
To compare predictors of viral infections, we applied general￾ised linear or logistic latent models using the xtreg or xtlogit
commands of Stata. We chose this method to take into account
the repeated measures in each LTR. ORs with CIs for AR (stage
2 or 3) and respiratory symptoms associated with respiratory
viruses were obtained using the same approach, controlling for
study site. The tacrolimus trough levels, which were abnormally
distributed, were compared between virus-positive and virus￾negative visits after log transformation.
Because the role of picornavirus is controversial, we carried
out sensitivity analyses excluding infection with picornavirus.
RESULTS
Patients and baseline characteristics
On average, patients received lung transplants a mean (SD) of
4.0 (4.1) years before study entry; nearly one-third (n=31;
27.7%) were transplanted within the previous 3 months.
Conditions leading to lung transplantation were mainly chronic
obstructive lung disease (42.8%) and cystic fibrosis (27.7%);
median age at transplantation was 49.5 years. Most patients
were on triple immunosuppressive therapy and 16% had BOS
stage 1 or more at study entry (table 1). Patients had a median
of five study visits and an average follow-up of 827 days (range
52−1037). A total of 903 visits were analysed: 570 (63.1%)
during screening periods defined by the study protocol; 124
(13.7%) routine post-transplantation visits; and 209 (23.2%)
due to new or worsening respiratory symptoms (see online
supplementary appendix table 1).
BAL and transbronchial biopsy
BAL fluid was obtained in 276 cases. In 153 specimens (55.4%),
no pathogen was detected. A virus was present in 34 (12%), at
least one bacterium in 73 (26.4%) and at least one fungus in 23
(8.3%). Thirty-two specimens (11.6%) were polymicrobial.
Multiple infection was found in 14/34 virus-positive BAL speci￾mens: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=6), Aspergillus spp (n=3),
Candida spp (n=3), Escherichia coli (n=2), Streptococcus pneu￾moniae (n=1) and non-tuberculous mycobacteria (n=1).
Two hundred and thirty-five TBB specimens were classified
according to the pathological AR grade (see online
supplementary appendix tables 1 and 2). LTR with moderate or
severe AR were frequently treated for rejection (A2 83.3%; A3
94.9%), while those with low-grade AR were rarely treated (A0
6.7%; A1 7.9%).
Incidence of viral infections
The viral infection rate was 19.3% (174/903) overall and 12.3%
(34/276) in the BAL subgroup. Sixty-eight of 112 LTR (61%)
had one or more viral infections (see online supplementary
appendix figure 1). Three had 10 or 11 viral infections; all were
BOS stage 3 and at least 5 years post-transplant. The incidence of
viral infection affecting upper and/or lower airways was 0.83 per
patient-year (95% CI 0.45 to 1.52). Patients transplanted within

the previous year did not have a higher incidence compared with
those more than 1 year post-transplant (incidence rate ratio
(IRR) 1.57 (95% CI 0.63 to 3.93); p=0.329). Incidence was not
associated with baseline BOS stage, comparing BOS 0 with later
stages (IRR 1.76 (95% CI 0.72 to 4.30); p=0.215).
Distribution of viral infections
Picornavirus was the most frequently detected virus for all visit
types (105/174, 60.3%) and among positive BAL specimens (20/
34, 59%) (figure 1). Sequence analysis and specific assays revealed
that almost all picornaviruses were in fact rhinoviruses (data not
shown). All viruses had a relatively similar distribution among
upper and lower respiratory specimens (figure 1A). During the
study period, 10 LTRs repeatedly screened positive for picorna￾virus. In three cases picornavirus infection lasted from 120 to
180 days, while it was shorter in others. However, we could not
distinguish between re-infection and protracted infection as
genome-sequencing techniques were not employed in this study.
Viruses other than picornavirus were four times more likely
to be identified at emergency visits (40/72, 65.6%) than at
routine or screening phase visits (29/102, 28.4%; OR 3.7 (95%
CI 1.7 to 8.1); p=0.010) (figure 1B). Adenovirus, PIV, RSV and
HMpV were also more frequently detected at emergency visits.
At the screening visits, 48% of patients reported new or wor￾sening symptoms (figure 2). The proportion of positive viral tests
was 10.0% (range 2.3−20.0%) for those without new symptoms
and 19.6% (range 6.4−29.7%) for those with new symptoms.
Strong seasonal patterns were observed—for example, viral
infections were less frequent during the summer and influenza
cases were observed mainly in February to March (figure 2).
Factors associated with viral infections
Higher tacrolimus serum trough levels were observed in patients
with concurrent viral infections (p=0.015; table 2). Time since
transplantation and BOS stage were not associated with viral

strongly associated with viral infections (43.1% and 49.3%,
respectively); rhinorrhoea and cough were also very frequent
(figure 3). Among all visits where BAL was performed, an emer￾gency visit (OR 6.2 (95% CI 1.5 to 26.2)) and sputum produc￾tion (OR 3.9 (95% CI 1.4 to 10.6)) were significantly associated
with viral infection. Serum C-reactive protein and procalcitonin
levels did not appear to be associated with viral infection (see
online supplementary appendix table 3).
Symptoms and short-term outcomes
Table 3 demonstrates the symptomatology, hospitalisation rate
and lung function change associated with each viral agent. Of
note, one-third of cases with picornavirus infection did not
report any new or worsening symptoms. The most prevalent
symptom for picornavirus was rhinorrhoea (43.0%), while fever
(14.3%) and myalgia (7.6%) were uncommon. At the other end
of the spectrum, influenza, RSV and PIV were almost systematic￾ally associated with new symptoms. Fever was present in 61.1%
of patients with influenza. The sum of new symptoms, ranging
from 0 to 9, varied according to specific viruses. Lower scores
were found for picornavirus (mean (SD) 2.2 (2.3) new symp￾toms) and human bocavirus (mean (SD) 2.5 (3.5), and higher
scores for influenza (4.4 (3.0), PIV (4.3 (1.6) and RSV (3.9
(2.4)). Overall, new infiltrates on chest x-ray were rare, except
for patients with influenza (22.2%). The hospitalisation rate
varied markedly among viruses. Hospitalisation rates during
viral respiratory infections were 50.0% (95% CI 30.0% to
70.1%) for transplant recipients with influenza or PIV, 18.9%
(95% CI 12.5% to 26.8%) for those with picornavirus, corona￾virus or human bocavirus, and 12.9% (95% CI 9.8% to 15.1%)
for patients without viral or bacterial infection. LTR with influ￾enza or paramyxoviruses (RSV, PIV) were three times more
likely to be hospitalised (OR 3.1 (95% CI 1.8 to 5.1); p<0.001)
than those without viral or bacterial infection. Patients with
picornavirus or coronavirus infection tended to be more fre￾quently hospitalised (OR 1.7 (95% CI 0.9 to 3.3); p=0.080)
than those without viral or bacterial infections.
Among the 12 patients who died during the study, picorna￾virus (2 patients) and adenovirus (1 patient) infections were
diagnosed shortly before death.
Lung function changes
Many LTR were too ill to perform acceptable quality lung func￾tion tests at an emergency visit, but function was poorer in those
with viral infection. LTR with viral infection had a mean loss of
106 mL (95% CI −157 mL to −56 mL) on forced expiratory
volume in 1 s (FEV1) compared with pre-infection lung function.
At recovery, function returned to pre-infection values. Table 3
and online supplementary appendix figure 2 show lung function
changes compared with pre-infection values. When excluding
picornavirus from the analyses, lung function change was within
a similar range (−106 mL (95% CI −189 mL to −23 mL).
Acute rejection (AR)
Biopsy-proven AR was not associated with concurrent viral infec￾tion (OR 0.4 (0.1 to 1.3)), nor was initiation of AR therapy within
the next 3 months (OR 0.8 (0.4 to 2.0)) (see online supplementary
appendix table 4). Table 2 in the online appendix details the fre￾quency of virus associated with acute vascular or bronchiolar rejec￾tion grades. There was still no association when picornavirus was
excluded from the analysis. The individual clinical course of an
initial viral infection identified via BAL is shown in online
supplementary appendix figure 3. Following the incident lower
respiratory tract infection, only three cases with picornavirus,
influenza or coronavirus experienced AR at 90, 120 and 150 days,
respectively (table 3). One additional patient had an upper respira￾tory picornavirus infection 90 days before AR.
DISCUSSION
We show that respiratory viral infections are very common in
LTR. Picornavirus, in particular rhinovirus, was the most fre￾quent causative agent recovered in both upper and lower
respiratory specimens, followed by coronavirus and influenza.
However, the clinical course of each of these viral infections
was variable. Of note, influenza and paramyxoviruses were asso￾ciated with a higher symptom load, contributing to 50% of
emergency visits and hospitalisations. Symptoms most often
encountered with picornavirus or coronavirus are cough and
rhinorrhoea, but one-third of our study population infected
with these agents were asymptomatic. Conversely, influenza,
paramyxovirus and adenovirus, which are less common, were

associated with a higher burden of symptoms. Almost all cases
with these viruses reported upper respiratory symptoms;
approximately one-half had systemic signs or symptoms such as
fever or fatigue.
Interestingly, picornavirus circulates year-round with an alter￾nating seasonal pattern.10 This contrasts with other viruses like
influenza which are found during seasonal epidemics only. We
further observed that the epidemiology and impact of viruses
differed in the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Picornavirus
and coronavirus were largely predominant in the upper respira￾tory tract and two-thirds were found during routine or screen￾ing visits. Again, this suggests a limited clinical impact of
picornavirus and coronavirus when recovered in the upper
respiratory tract, as these were not patient-initiated visits.
Picornavirus and coronavirus were also predominant in the
lower respiratory tract. Of 34 viral infections detected in 276 BAL
samples, 20 (59%) were caused by picornaviruses, mainly rhino￾viruses. Compared with influenza or paramyxoviruses which are
known to infect the lower respiratory tract, this proportion is
higher than previously reported.9 11 12 This may be due in part to
the sensitivity of the assays used, the population selected or the
study design: all cases were systematically screened, even in the
absence of overt clinical symptoms.13–15 The lower respiratory
tropism of rhinovirus and its ability to promote exacerbations have
been documented, particularly in patients with asthma or chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease.16 17 In LTR, rhinovirus has been
shown to adapt to the lower respiratory tract and cause protracted
and chronic infections.18 19 We further describe distinct symptom
patterns triggered by specific respiratory viruses. Our study sup￾ports previous observations that systemic signs and symptoms such
as fever, fatigue and myalgia are often reported for influenza or
RSV, but rarely for picornavirus: 60% of influenza cases presented
with fever compared with fewer than 15% of picornavirus cases.
Nevertheless, symptom overlap in our study population limited
our ability to accurately predict the virus type. Our study confirms
that immunosuppressed patients manifest fever inconsistently.20
This contrasts with community-based studies of influenza where
subjects are immunocompetent and not exposed to steroids and
report a prevalence of fever of 68–86%.21 Lower FEV1 or forced
vital capacity (FVC) compared with pre-infection values were
observed in patients with viral infection. Mallia et al22 recently
reported that rhinovirus infection in patients with chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease resulted in decreased peak flow
without significant loss in FEV1 or FVC. A more significant loss of
function was observed in cystic fibrosis patients with viral infec￾tion, mostly due to rhinovirus.23 Although the inability to obtain
spirometry measurements in acutely ill patients is an unavoidable
limitation, our study supports previous reports showing that viral
infection acutely affects function in LTR.6 24
It has been theorised that viral infections promote acute graft
rejection.8 While some case series suggest an association
between the two,25 26 other studies—some prospective—have
found no association.6 27 A meta-analysis could not confirm this
link.7 Similarly, the present prospective study shows no temporal
relation between respiratory viruses and biopsy-proven AR.
However, this finding does not preclude an association between
viral infection and chronic graft rejection.
We identified elevated tacrolimus levels as a possible risk
factor for viral infection. To our knowledge, no prospective
study has yet employed both a quantitative evaluation of
immunosuppression and concomitant viral screening in LTR. As
calcineurin inhibitors weaken the lymphocyte-mediated immune
response, it is plausible that viruses are not contained, leading
to prolonged shedding and protracted infection.

The study included prespecified periods during which trans￾plant recipients were screened for viral infection, independent
of symptomatology. Asymptomatic carriage of viral RNA or
DNA in the upper respiratory tract was found at 10% of screen￾ing visits, most belonging to picornavirus. While viral RNA,
mostly from rhinovirus, was detected in up to 30% of asymp￾tomatic immunocompetent children,10 28 29 Johnston et al30
found only 4% of asymptomatic adults to be carrying rhino￾viruses. However, the true prevalence of asymptomatic viral car￾riage in immunocompetent adults remains uncertain and thus
cannot be compared with the rate observed in our study popula￾tion during screening periods.
The strengths of our study are its prospective design with a full
record of all visits over more than 30 months, as well as the use of
an extensive panel of RT-PCR viral tests. It is unlikely that clinic￾ally significant viral infections were missed in our cohort. The
seven screening periods covering all four seasons offered a unique
opportunity to evaluate the incidence of asymptomatic viral infec￾tion. The fact that lung function could not be evaluated in many
acutely ill patients is a limitation. This potential bias may lead to
an underestimation of lung function loss due to acute viral infec￾tion, but does not alter our conclusions.
This large prospective study of LTR found that respiratory
viral infections could be diagnosed in one-third of emergency
visits. Viral infections transiently diminish lung function and
lead to more hospitalisations, often including invasive proce￾dures such as bronchoscopy, but are not associated with AR.
Asymptomatic viral infection is rare and occurs most often with
picornavirus. Specific antiviral therapy in LTR is limited and its
efficacy as yet unproven.3 31 32 26 The incidence and clinical
impact of viral infections in LTR demonstrated by this study
suggest a need for trials investigating both preventive and pro￾tective interventions in this population.
