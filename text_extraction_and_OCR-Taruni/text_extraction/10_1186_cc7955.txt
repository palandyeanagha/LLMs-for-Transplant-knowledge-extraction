Abstract
Introduction The assessment of volume responsiveness and
the decision to administer a fluid bolus is a common dilemma
facing physicians caring for critically ill patients. Static markers
of cardiac preload are poor predictors of volume
responsiveness, and dynamic markers are often limited by the
presence of spontaneous respirations or cardiac arrhythmias.
Passive leg raising (PLR) represents an endogenous volume
challenge that can be used to predict fluid responsiveness.
Methods Medical intensive care unit (ICU) patients requiring
volume expansion were eligible for enrollment. Non-invasive
measurements of stroke volume (SV) were obtained before and
during PLR using a transthoracic Doppler ultrasound device
prior to volume expansion. Measurements were then repeated
following volume challenge to classify patients as either volume
responders or non-responders based on their hemodynamic
response to volume expansion. The change in SV from baseline
during PLR was then compared with the change in SV with
volume expansion to determine the ability of PLR in conjunction
with SV measurement to predict volume responsiveness.
Results A total of 102 fluid challenges in 89 patients were
evaluated. In 47 of the 102 fluid challenges (46.1%), SV
increased by ≥15% after volume infusion (responders). A SV
increase induced by PLR of ≥15% predicted volume
responsiveness with a sensitivity of 81%, specificity of 93%,
positive predictive value of 91% and negative predictive value of
85%.
Conclusions Non-invasive SV measurement and PLR can
predict fluid responsiveness in a broad population of medical
ICU patients. Less than 50% of ICU patients given fluid boluses
were volume responsive.
Introduction
Circulatory insufficiency is a common clinical problem faced
by physicians caring for critically ill patients. The decision to
employ volume expansion (VE) in these patients is compli￾cated [1]. If a patient is preload responsive, then VE improves
cardiac output (CO). Early resuscitation protocols that include
fluid therapy can be life saving early in the course of sepsis
[2,3]. However, in a preload unresponsive patient, volume
administration has no hemodynamic benefit. Liberal volume
resuscitation can exacerbate pulmonary edema, precipitate
respiratory failure, prolong mechanical ventilation times, and
contribute to the development of intra-abdominal hypertension
[4-6]. Prior studies have shown positive fluid balance to corre￾late with reduced survival [7-9]. In addition, prospective stud￾ies have shown that less than 50% of critically ill patients
respond to the fluid boluses that are deemed necessary by
treating clinicians [10-14]. A simple, non-invasive bedside test
to determine volume responsiveness that would assist clini￾cians in facing this daily dilemma would have significant utility.
Passive leg raising (PLR) is a simple maneuver used for gen￾erations as an initial intervention for patients in shock. This pro￾cedure rapidly returns 150 to 200 ml of blood from the veins
of the lower extremities to the central circulation [15]. As a
result of increased ventricular preload, the CO is augmented
according to the degree of preload reserve, and rapidly

reversed when the legs are returned to a horizontal position.
PLR therefore constitutes a reversible volume challenge dur￾ing which hemodynamic changes can be measured [16].
The aim of our study was to determine if noninvasive stroke
volume (SV) measurement could be used in conjunction with
PLR to predict the hemodynamic response to VE.
Materials and methods
Patients
This study was conducted at Barnes-Jewish Hospital, a univer￾sity-affiliated, urban teaching hospital. The study was
approved by the Washington University School of Medicine
Human Studies Committee. As the protocol was considered
part of routine practice, informed consent was waived.
Patients were informed that they participated in this study.
Patients were enrolled from the medical intensive care unit
(ICU), and any patient requiring VE as determined by the ICU
attending physician was eligible for enrollment. No specific cri￾teria for circulatory insufficiency were required for study entry.
However, the decision of the ICU attending to administer fluid
was based on clinical signs of inadequate tissue perfusion
(e.g. escalating vasopressor requirement, decreasing urine
output, etc.) and his/her clinical impression that the patient
should be given a trial of volume expansion. Exclusion criteria
included known aortic or pulmonary valve disease, known
ascending aortic aneurysm, or contraindication to PLR for any
reason.
Data collection
Stroke volume measurements were taken using a non-inva￾sive, transthoracic Doppler ultrasound device (USCOM®;
Uscom Ltd., Sydney, Australia). All measurements were per￾formed by a single investigator (ST) following training on the
device. Each study measurement was taken in accordance
with a previously described protocol designed to optimize
accuracy and reliability [17]. The device used directly meas￾ures the blood flow through either the aortic or pulmonary
valves. For each patient studied, both positions were
attempted and the location that resulted in the best signal was
used.
Study measurements were taken in four stages (Figure 1). In
stage one the patient was placed in a semi-recumbent position
with the head elevated at 45 degrees. In stage two, the patient
was positioned supine with the legs straight and elevated at
45 degrees for two minutes. Stage three readings were taken
two minutes after the patient was returned to the baseline
position, and stage four immediately following VE. Calibrated
automatic bed elevation (using standard ICU beds) was used
to move the patient between stages.
Products for VE varied according to the order of the attending
physician and included normal saline, Ringer's lactate and het￾astarch. The volume administered in each case was at least
500 ml, and was given as a pressurized rapid infusion.
Vasopressor doses and ventilator settings were not changed
at any time while a patient was being studied. Lower extremity
compression devices were removed prior to the initial read￾ings. Study measurements were recorded before, during, and
after PLR and after VE throughout the stages described
above.
Definition of volume responsiveness
Patients were classified according to their hemodynamic
response to VE. Responders had a SV increment of at least
15% in response to VE (an increase in SV from stage one to
stage four), while non-responders had a SV increase of less
than 15%. Cutoff values of 10% to 15% have been previously
used as representing a significant change in SV and cardiac
index in similar studies [1,16,18-20], and a 15% change was
reported as a significant difference between two measures of
CO by thermodilution [21].
Statistical analysis
Continuous data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation.
The Student's t-test was used for comparisons made between
parametric data, and nonparametric data were analyzed with
the Mann-Whitney U test. For categorical variables, chi￾squared or Fisher's exact tests were used to test for differ￾ences between groups. The areas under receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curves are expressed as the area ±
standard error, and were compared using the Hanley-McNeil
method [22]. All tests were two-tailed, and a P value of less

than 0.05 was pre-determined to be statistically significant.

P value considered statistically significant is given [23,24].
Analyses were performed using the SPSS© version 11.0.1
software package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
Patient characteristics
A total of 102 volume challenges in 89 consecutive patients
were evaluated. One patient had three studies performed,
while the remaining patients with more than one study had two
studies each. Repeat studies performed on the same patient
were separated in time by at least 24 hours. Thirteen additional
patients were examined, although either they were unable to
tolerate the procedure (three patients), unable to cooperate
due to confusion or delirium (six patients), or satisfactory Dop￾pler signals could not be obtained (four patients).
Stroke volume increased by 15% or more in 47 (46.1%)
instances (responders), and by less than 15% in 55 (53.9%)
instances (non-responders). For the purposes of data analysis,
each volume challenge was considered an independent
observation regardless of whether it was part of multiple stud￾ies performed on the same patient.
The resulting pool of volume challenges were performed on
patients who were aged 59.4 ± 15.1 years, with 58 (56.9%)
men and 44 (43.1%) women. Fifty-nine (57.8%) patients were
receiving vasopressor support, 67 (65.7%) were mechanically
ventilated, with 14 (20.9%) of those fully accommodated to
the ventilator, and their Acute Physiology and Chronic Health
Evaluation II score was 18.5 ± 6.1. The time elapsed between
ICU admission and study entry was 61.7 ± 106.2 hours. Car￾diac arrhythmias were present in 18 (17.5%) patients (atrial
fibrillation in eight, premature ventricular beats in six, and pre￾mature atrial beats in four). The patient characteristics are
summarized in Table 1.
Effects of PLR and volume expansion
The initial hemodynamic measurements are summarized in
Table 2. The responders had a significantly lower initial SV (68
± 25 ml vs. 87 ± 30 ml, P<0.001 compared with the non￾responders, although the CO (6.8 ± 2.5 L/min vs. 8.0 ± 2.9 L/
min, P = 0.03), corrected flow time (FTc; 363 ± 70 ms vs. 398
± 66 ms, P = 0.01), mean arterial pressure (MAP; 68 ± 13
mmHg vs. 74 ± 14 mmHg, P = 0.03), and heart rate (101 ±
20 beats/min vs. 93 ± 20 beats/min, P = 0.06) were not dif￾ferent between the groups (Bonferroni adjusted level of signif￾icance for all comparisons 0.01).
The hemodynamic readings taken throughout the four stages
of measurements are summarized in Table 3. For the respond￾ers, PLR induced a significant increase in SV (68 ± 25 ml vs.
82 ± 30 ml, P = 0.001), but the CO (6.8 ± 2.5 L/min vs. 8.0
± 2.8 L/min, P = 0.03), FTc (363 ± 70 ms vs. 380 ± 68 ms, P
= 0.22), MAP (68 ± 13 mmHg vs. 72 ± 11 mmHg, P = 0.11),
heart rate (101 ± 20 beats/min vs. 99 ± 21 beats/min, P =
0.64), and pulse pressure (42 ± 14 mmHg vs. 45 ± 14 mmHg,
P = 0.23) were unchanged (Bonferroni adjusted level of sig￾nificance for all comparisons 0.01). The increase in SV was
completely reversed when the patient was returned to the
semi-recumbent position.
In the non-responders, PLR did not induce a significant
change in any of the hemodynamic values measured. The SV
(87 ± 30 ml vs. 91 ± 33 ml, P = 0.58), CO (8.0 ± 2.9 L/min
vs. 8.4 ± 3.5 L/min, P = 0.46), FTc (398 ± 66 ms vs. 404 ±
78 ms, P = 0.66), MAP (74 ± 14 mmHg vs. 74 ± 16 mmHg,
P = 0.95), heart rate (93 ± 20 beats/min vs. 94 ± 21 beats/
min, P = 0.84), and pulse pressure (48 ± 15 mmHg vs. 49 ±
17 mmHg, P = 0.97) remained unchanged during PLR.
The changes in SV compared with stage one induced by both
PLR and VE were significantly higher in the responders com￾pared with the non-responders. The SV increased in response
to PLR in the responders and non-responders by 21.0% ±
12.5% and 3.2% ± 10.4%, respectively (P<0.001, Bonferroni
adjusted level of significance 0.01; Figure 2). The SV
increased in response to VE in the responders and non￾responders by 26.3% ± 14.2% and 3.5% ± 8.6%, respec￾tively (P < 0.001, Bonferroni adjusted level of significance
0.01). The PLR-induced increase in SV was reversed once the
patient was taken out of the PLR position (Table 3).
Central venous pressure
The initial central venous pressure (CVP) was not different
between the groups of responders and non-responders (7.8 ±
4.9 mmHg vs. 8.1 ± 4.8 mmHg, P = 0.80; Table 2). Addition￾ally, the change in CVP between stages one and four was not
different between the responders and non-responders (2.1 ±
3.0 mmHg vs. 3.2 ± 2.3 mmHg, P = 0.13).
Prediction of volume response
A SV increase induced by PLR of 15% or more predicted vol￾ume response with a sensitivity of 81%, specificity of 93%,
positive predictive value of 91%, and a negative predictive
value of 85% (Figure 3).
The area under the ROC curve for the percent change in SV
during PLR predicting a response to VE was 0.89 ± 0.04.
Other than the SV, no hemodynamic index significantly
changed during PLR. However, several other indices were dif￾ferent, although not statistically significant, at baseline
between the responders and non-responders. ROC curves for
these initial measures predicting volume response were also
constructed. Compared with the SV change during PLR these
indices were inferior at differentiating the responders from the
non-responders, and included the stage one SV (ROC curve
area 0.70 ± 0.05, P = 0.001), CO (0.62 ± 0.06, P < 0.001),
CVP (0.52 ± 0.08, P < 0.001), MAP (0.63 ± 0.06, P < 0.001),

and FTc (0.65 ± 0.06, P < 0.001). The ROC curves for SV
change with PLR and initial CVP and SV are shown in Figure
4.
Repeatability of measurements
A repeatability analysis was performed using the paired read￾ings for stages one and three from each patient. The hemody￾namic effects of PLR are transient and reversible, and
vasoactive agents were not changed between these measure￾ments. Therefore, it is expected that the readings from these
stages would not be different and can be used to validate the
use of a 15% change in SV as being significant. Using the
method described by Bland and Altman [25] the upper and
lower limits of agreement between stages one and three were
13.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 13.2% to 14.6%) and
-10.9% (95% CI = -11.6% to -10.2%), respectively. The cor￾responding plot of the log-transformed SV difference against
mean is shown in Figure 5.
Discussion
Our study demonstrates that a completely non-invasive SV
measurement in conjunction with PLR can predict the hemo￾dynamic response to VE. In our relatively unselected popula￾tion of medical ICU patients, the change in SV with PLR was
the only hemodynamic index with significant predictive ability.
The initial CVP was not different between the groups of

not correlate with the change in SV following VE. A repeatabil￾ity analysis revealed that a cutoff of 15% representing a signif￾icant change in SV is reasonable.

patients following coronary artery bypass surgery and com￾pared SV measurements obtained with the USCOM® and the
PAC [27]. The SV measurements demonstrated a bias of 1.0
ml (limits of agreement -1.5 ml to 3.5 ml) for aortic measure￾ments and 1.6 ml (limits of agreement -0.21 ml to 3.4 ml) for
pulmonary readings. Tan and colleagues examined 24
mechanically ventilated patients following cardiac surgery and
compared 40 paired CO readings obtained by the USCOM ®
and the PAC [28]. The resulting bias between the two meth￾ods was 0.18 L/min with limits of agreement of -1.43 L/min to
1.78 L/min. Finally, Dey and Sprivulis developed and tested a
protocol to optimize inter-assessor reliability with the
USCOM® device [29]. Two trained physicians performed
blinded assessments on 21 emergency department patients.
The inter-assessor correlation coefficient for CO measure￾ments was 0.91 (95% CI = 0.85 to 0.95, P < 0.001), and the
average difference between paired readings was 0.2 ± 0.2 L/

flow of 10% or more during PLR was found to predict volume
response with a sensitivity of 97% and specificity of 94%.
Boulain and colleagues studied 39 patients with a PAC and
radial arterial line in place, and found that the change in pulse
pressure and SV were significantly correlated both during PLR
and following VE [30]. Lafanechère and colleagues examined
22 intubated and fully sedated patients with an esophageal
Doppler monitor in place [31]. An increase in aortic blood flow
of more than 8% during PLR predicted volume response with
a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 83%. Finally, Monnet
and colleagues studied 34 mechanically ventilated patients
with arterial lines in place who were not necessarily fully
accommodated to the ventilator [32]. Changes in arterial pulse
pressure and pulse contour-derived cardiac index during end￾expiratory occlusion of the ventilator as well as changes in car￾diac index during PLR were examined. An increase in cardiac
index of 10% or more during PLR predicted an increase in car￾diac index following VE of 15% or more with a sensitivity of
91% and a specificity of 100%. Changes in pulse pressure
and cardiac index during end-expiratory occlusion had similar
predictive value.
Our specificity is comparable with these studies, but our sen￾sitivity is somewhat lower. This may be the result of a less
selected patient population and the inclusion of patients
regardless of underlying diagnoses that may diminish the
effect of PLR. Included in our study was one patient with lower
extremity contractures, two patients with extensive bilateral
lower extremity deep venous thrombosis, two chronically bed￾bound quadriplegic patients, two patients with unilateral
below the knee amputation, one patient with massive ascites,
and one patient with abdominal compartment syndrome. Addi￾tionally, the use of a less invasive technique may have contrib￾uted to our lower sensitivity. Non-invasive measures of cardiac
function have been previously studied in conjunction with PLR,
and also demonstrated lower sensitivity for predicting the
response to VE. For example, Lamia and colleagues and
Maizel and colleagues studied 24 and 34 patients, respec￾tively, with transthoracic echocardiography in conjunction with
PLR [19,20]. Changes in CO and SV were predictive of vol￾ume response, but the sensitivities were somewhat lower at
77% and 69%, respectively.
The dilemma of which patients to subject to VE is encountered
daily in the ICU. One of the principal uses for the PAC was to
differentiate between various etiologies of hypotension and
thereby guide therapy to optimize a patients' hemodynamic
status [33]. However, with numerous clinical trials showing no
benefit, concerns about safety, and rampant misinterpretation
of data, the PAC is being used infrequently now in North Amer￾ican ICUs. This is likely to be contributing to a situation of prob￾able under-monitoring of many critically ill patients [34-39].
Many intensivists now base most of their VE decisions on the
CVP [2,40]. However, the CVP is a poor predictor of volume
responsiveness and should not be used to make clinical deci￾sions regarding fluid management [10,41]. This underscores
the need for alternative fluid management strategies.
This study has some limitations. First, there were 13 additional
patients that were to be enrolled, but were either unable to
perform PLR or an adequate Doppler signal could not be
obtained. However, analgesia or sedation may have facilitated
successful measurements in many of these patients. Second,
the majority of patients enrolled in our study had sepsis or
hypovolemia as the etiology of their circulatory insufficiency.
This may limit somewhat the applicability of this technique.
Third, there was a significant difference in the presence of
arrhythmias between the groups of responders and non￾responders. This clouds the issue of whether or not this tech￾nique can be employed in patients with arrhythmia. However,
the SV change with PLR predicted the correct SV response to
VE in 16 of the 18 patients with arrhythmia.
Finally, the use of repeat studies on the same patient as inde￾pendent observations may have impacted the results of the
analysis. It is possible that sequential measurements taken on
the same patient were correlated, which could alter the error
term for any given analysis. However, the patients enrolled in
this study were being actively treated in the ICU, and repeat
studies on the same patient were separated in time by at least
24 hours. Hemodynamic interventions performed in that time
would presumably impact the results of subsequent studies,
minimizing any correlation that may exist between the two
studies. In support of this assertion, a limited analysis was
repeated using only the first challenge on each patient, with
results similar to those for the complete data set. The SV
increased in response to PLR in the responders and non￾responders by 21.7 ± 12.7% and 3.2 ± 12.0%, respectively
(P < 0.001). The SV increased in response to VE in the
responders and non-responders by 26.3 ± 13.3% and 2.0 ±
8.5%, respectively (P < 0.001). A SV increase induced by
PLR of 15% or more predicted volume response with a sensi￾tivity of 79%, specificity of 91%, positive predictive value of
90%, and a negative predictive value of 82%. The upper and
lower limits of agreement in the repeatability analysis were
14.4% and -11.2%, respectively.
Conclusions
We have demonstrated that a transthoracic Doppler ultra￾sound device can be used in conjunction with PLR to predict
volume responsiveness in a variety of unselected medical ICU
patients. Less than 50% of the patients subjected to fluid load￾ing were volume responsive, underscoring the need for routine
application of such methods when VE is considered. As with
many non-invasive diagnostic maneuvers, results from this
technique are likely best interpreted and clinically applied as
one part of a larger clinical picture with the ultimate goal being
a decrease in the amount of fluid loading that does not result
in improved cardiac output.
