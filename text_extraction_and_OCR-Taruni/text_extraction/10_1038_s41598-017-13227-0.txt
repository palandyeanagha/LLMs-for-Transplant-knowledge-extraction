Mammalian mitochondria can be transferred between cells both in culture and in vivo. There is 
evidence that isolated mitochondria enter cells by endocytosis, but the mechanism has not been 
fully characterised. We investigated the entry mechanism of isolated mitochondria into human 
osteosarcoma (HOS) cells. Initially we confirmed that respiratory-competent cells can be produced 
following incubation of HOS cells lacking mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) with functional exogenous 
mitochondria and selection in a restrictive medium. Treatment of HOS cells with inhibitors of different 
endocytic pathways suggest that uptake of EGFP-labelled mitochondria occurs via an actin-dependent 
endocytic pathway which is consistent with macropinocytosis. We later utilised time-lapse microscopy 
to show that internalised mitochondria were found in large, motile cellular vesicles. Finally, we used 
confocal imaging to show that EGFP-labelled mitochondria colocalise with a macropinocytic cargo 
molecule during internalisation, HOS cells produce membrane ruffles interacting with external 
mitochondria during uptake and EGFP-labelled mitochondria are found within early macropinosomes 
inside cells. In conclusion our results are consistent with isolated mitochondria being internalised by 
macropinocytosis in HOS cells.
Mitochondria are double membrane bound organelles involved in diverse cellular processes, which include pro￾ducing ATP, cellular Ca2+ homeostasis, autophagy, apoptosis and haeme biosynthesis. In addition, human mito￾chondria carry multiple copies of a double-stranded, circular DNA genome that is 16.5kb in size. This encodes 13 
essential subunits of the electron transport chain and ATP synthase, allowing cells to carry out oxidative phospho￾rylation (OxPhos), 22 tRNAs and 2 ribosomal RNAs1
. Mutations in either mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or in 
nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins are a well-documented cause of human genetic disease2
. Mitochondria 
display interesting characteristics as organelles, since they are dynamic structures existing as discrete units or 
undergoing fusion to form tubular networks. In addition, the last thirty years have provided evidence that mito￾chondria are mobile structures able to undergo transfer into cells.
Current data suggest that two forms of mitochondrial transfer (also referred to as “mitochondrial transforma￾tion”) take place in culture and in vivo: (i) an intercellular type occurring between cells3
 and (ii) an extracellular 
type which transports mitochondria into cells from the environment4
. Intercellular mitochondrial transfer seems 
to occur by two mechanisms either across nanotubes connecting cells5,6
 or through the release and internalisation 
of vesicles5,7,8
. Transfer of isolated mitochondria into mammalian cells is thought to be mediated by endocytosis.
Endocytosis is the production of new internal membranes from the plasma membrane leading to inter￾nalisation of membrane lipids, proteins and extracellular fluid into the cell. This process is important for the 
transport of material into cells. At least ten separate endocytic routes have been identified. All involve deforma￾tion of the plasma membrane to facilitate import of materials, but pathways vary in function, morphology and 
cargo. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is defined as receptor-mediated uptake of extracellular material

at the cell surface into clathrin-coated vesicles. Caveolae-mediated endocytosis involves internalisation of cargo 
into flask-shaped invaginations of the plasma membrane9
. Both caveolae-mediated endocytosis and CME 
require dynamin, a mechanochemical enzyme, which mediates membrane fission during vesicle formation10. 
Macropinocytosis internalises extracellular fluid or particles into large vesicles that are between 0.2–5 μm in 
diameter. These vesicles are formed by actin-rich protrusions of the plasma membrane, called membrane ruffles11. 
These structures are variable in their morphology and include planar lamellipodia, circular dorsal ruffles 
(ring-shaped), finger-like filopodia and membrane blebs (large extrusions of the plasma membrane). Membrane 
ruffles can extend and fold over cargo or develop into cup-shaped structures that fuse over extracellular material. 
The ruffles form spontaneously or in response to growth factors, peptides and phorbol esters, which activates a 
receptor tyrosine-kinase pathway. This leads to the recruitment of multiple downstream effectors, that results in 
actin polymerisation, generation of membrane ruffles and macropinosome formation12.
Several studies have reported that isolated mitochondria enter mammalian cells by endocytosis13–18. However, 
there is disagreement regarding the underlying mechanism. Two groups have suggested that macropinocytosis 
mediates mitochondrial internalisation in a few human cell lines16,18. However, another study reported that mito￾chondrial internalisation in rat cardomyocytes is mediated by an actin-dependent endocytic pathway that is not 
macropinocytosis17. The existing studies provide conflicting and incomplete evidence regarding pathways medi￾ating mitochondrial entry in mammalian cells. It is possible that there are species or cell specifc differences in the 
pathways responsible for mitochondrial entry. However, with the exception of recent analyses presented by Kesner 
et al., current evidence supporting the involvement of endocytic pathways in mitochondrial entry has relied 
almost exclusively on endocytic inhibitor data. Since these compounds can inhibit multiple endocytic pathways19, 
inhibitor data alone cannot be reliably used to investigate the routes of internalisation for an endocytic cargo.
Here, we confirm the previous observations on internalisation of exogenous mitochondria being able to 
restore OxPhos function to recipient human cells and that they can be stably maintained. Importantly, we present 
detailed evidence using endocytic inhibitors, endocytic agonists and confocal microscopy that mitochondrial 
entry into human osteosarcoma (HOS) cells occurs by macropinocytosis.
Results
Functional mitochondria restore OxPhos in ρ0 cells and are maintained in recipient human 
cells. Firstly, we investigated whether purified mitochondria could be introduced into HOS ρ0
 cells, which 
lack mtDNA as reported in previously published studies. Isolated ρ+ mitochondria from HEK293T cells were 
incubated with HOS ρ0
 cells. Successful uptake of functional mitochondria by recipient cells should result in 
their gaining the ability to oxidatively phosphorylate. We used galactose medium lacking uridine and pyruvate 
to select recipient cells that could perform OxPhos. Additional drug selection was applied to prevent growth 
(or cell fusion) of any donor HEK293T cells, that might have survived the mitochondrial isolation procedure 
(Fig. 1A). An average of 9 respiratory competent clones per 1.5×105
 HOS ρ0
 cells was recovered by this method 
using 125 µg/ml of isolated mitochondria in 3 independent experiments (Table 1). Clones were able to survive 
in OxPhos selective medium for at least 1 week. Control experiments using either sonicated mitochondria or 
without the addition of ρ+ mitochondria failed to produce OxPhos competent clones, suggesting that intact orga￾nelles are required to render the recipient cells ρ+ (Table 1). Finally, we confirmed that the OxPhos competent 
clones contain recipient HOS cell nuclear DNA and the donor HEK293T cell mtDNA, by subjecting clones to 
SNP analysis (Fig. 1B,C). These data suggest that incubation of ρ+ mitochondria with ρ0
 HOS cells leads to stable 
restoration of OxPhos function, consistent with assimilation of donor mitochondria by recipient HOS cells. This 
finding is also consistent with previously published data for other cell types16,20.
Compounds that interfere with macropinocytosis block internalisation of mitochondria by 
HOS cells. In order to investigate if endocytic pathways were responsible for mitochondrial entry into 
HOS cells, we used chemical inhibitors of different pathways to determine if these compounds were able to 
prevent mitochondrial internalisation by cells. Firstly, drug concentrations were optimised in HOS cells using 
appropriate fluorescent cargo molecules and three different endocytic pathway inhibitors. Internalisation of 
fluorescent molecules by HOS cells was tested using FACS. We analysed the following marker/inhibitor pairs: 
Alexafluor-transferrin/dynasore, FITC-CTB/chlorpromazine (CPZ), FITC-CTB/MβCD, FITC-dextran/EIPA 
and FITC-dextran/wortmannin (Fig. S1)21–23. Transferrin and CTB are commonly used to monitor internalisa￾tion by CME and caveolae-mediated endocytosis respectively. 70 kDa dextran and other high molecular weight 
dextrans are preferentially internalised by macropinocytosis and they are routinely used to study internalisation 
by this endocytic pathway24,25. The data obtained suggested that HOS cells operate various endocytic pathways 
and helped to establish working concentrations for the inhibitory compounds (Fig. S1).
We then employed the same FACS-based assay to quantify the number of HOS cells containing EGFP-labelled 
mitochondria in the presence and absence of endocytic pathway inhibitors. Test HOS cells were pre-treated with 
inhibitors followed by incubation with mitochondria labelled with nuclearly-encoded, mitochondrially-targeted 
EGFP, which were isolated from HEK293T cells. Cells were treated with trypsin, washed, and then analysed for 
green fluorescence by FACS to quantify the proportion of EGFP-positive cells. Both CPZ and MβCD impaired 
mitochondrial entry into cells (Fig. 2A,B). These drugs are classically used to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocy￾tosis (CME) and caveolae-mediated endocytosis. However, they also affect macropinocytosis. MβCD extracts 
cholesterol from the plasma membrane, impairing membrane ruffle formation and CPZ inhibits phospholipase 
C (PLC), which acts in macropinosome closure12,26,27. The dynamin inhibitor dynasore is used to block CME and 
caveolae-mediated endocytosis21. There is evidence that dynasore also inhibits circular dorsal ruffling, which is 
associated with macropinocytosis28. However, it is not known to inhibit lamellipodial or bleb-associated macropi￾nocytosis and dynasore did not prevent mitochondrial internalisation by cells (Fig. 2C). Moreover, mitochondrial 
entry was impaired in the presence of compounds that inhibit macropinocytosis (Fig. 2D–F). EIPA blocks the

Na+/H+ transporter, leading to acidification of sub-membranous pH and disruption of the macropinocytic sig￾nalling cascade. Macropinocytosis is much more sensitive to the effects of acidification than CME29. Wortmannin 
inhibits PI3K, which is required for macropinosome closure30 and latrunculin A binds monomeric actin, prevent￾ing its incorporation into filaments, which results in disruption to actin polymerisation and macropinocytosis31,32. 
The overall pattern of inhibition provided by these three compounds (EIPA, wortmannin and latrunculin A), is 
consistent with effects on an actin-dependent pathway, possibly macropinocytosis. Two other studies have sug￾gested that macropinocytic inhibitors interfere with mitochondrial uptake into human cells16,18.
Mitochondrial entry is enhanced by stimulating macropinocytosis. Macropinocytosis is known 
to be stimulated by ligand binding to growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases, resulting in the activation of a 
signalling cascade, which regulates actin dynamics and macropinosome closure. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) 
enhances macropinocytosis in epithelial cell lines33,34. Therefore, if mitochondria enter HOS cells by macropino￾cytosis, stimulating cells with EGF should cause an increase in mitochondrial internalisation. In order to examine 
the effect of growth factors on mitochondrial internalisation, cells were incubated with EGFP-labelled mitochon￾dria in the presence of either EGF or fibroblast growth factor (FGF). Samples were analysed by FACS to quan￾tify the numbers of cells containing EGFP-labelled mitochondria. Treatment with EGF during mitochondrial 
uptake assays caused a 1.5 fold increase in mitochondrial internalisation by cells (Fig. 2G), whereas treatment 
with FGF, which affects cell migration and proliferation but not macropinocytosis, did not affect mitochondrial 
entry (Fig. 2H)35.
Internalised mitochondria are transported in vesicles. The growth factor stimulation and inhibitor 
assays, suggested that mitochondria enter cells by macropinocytosis. In order to show this process in action we 
imaged mitochondrial uptake in cells using confocal microscopy. Firstly, we demonstrated that EGFP-labelled 
mitochondria were localised inside cells by using a cytoplasmic stain to delineate internal cell volumes (Fig. 3A). 
Cells samples produced for microscopy analysis could not be treated with trypsin and this is a likely explanation 
for the presence of extracellular EGFP-labelled mitochondria on cell surfaces. Furthermore, samples of EGFP 
positive cells identified by FACS were later examined by confocal microscopy to confirm whether the EGFP signal 
in these sorted cells originated from inside the cell or from the cell surface (Fig. S2). After 90min of incubation 
30% of cells contained EGFP-labelled mitochondria (Fig. 3B), which was consistent with the FACS-based anal￾yses (Fig. 2). Next, we followed internalisation of EGFP-labelled mitochondria into HOS cells using time-lapse 
microscopy. HOS cells were transfected with an F-actin probe, Lifeact36 to define cell borders and then incubated 
with EGFP-labelled mitochondria. A 3 μm section through each cell was imaged in order to track internalised 
EGFP-labelled mitochondria. These studies showed that EGFP-labelled mitochondria are transported around 
cells in large, motile vesicles (0.5–1.5 μm in diameter) (Fig. 3C–D, Movie S1). It is theoretically possible that 
the intracellular vesicles observed in recipient cells are in fact remnants of cellular debris from mitochondria 
isolation. However, this seems very unlikely as such mitochondria containing vesicles would need to be present 
and remain stable in the hypotonic buffer used during mitochondria isolation. These debris derived vesicles 
would also need to be present in high quantities to be consistently observed inside cells during live mitochondrial 
uptake assays and to be responsible for the internalised mitochondria seen in fixed samples. Lastly, during any 
internalisation process these vesicles would acquire a second plasma membrane coat, producing double mem￾braned structures. Double membraned vesicles containing mitochondria were not observed during our live assays 
(Fig. 3C–D). Taken together these data are consistent with the macropinocytic pathway of mitochondrial entry.
Mitochondria are internalised with a known macropinocytic cargo molecule. Fluorescent cargo 
molecules known to be ingested by a particular endocytic pathway can be used to follow internalisation by that 
route9
. Therefore, we used confocal time-lapse microscopy to confirm that HOS cells can macropinocytose, by 
adding 70 kDa FITC-dextran to cells and following its internalisation over time. The assays showed uptake of 
FITC-dextran into large, motile vesicles at the cell periphery, which were later transported more centrally within 
the cell (Fig. S2). These characteristics are consistent with macropinocytosis.
Moreover, colocalisation of a cargo of interest with the fluorescent marker during internalisation suggests 
that they both enter by the same endocytic route. This approach is commonly used to investigate the endocytosis 
of routine cargo and pathogens12. High molecular weight dextran enters cells mainly by macropinocytosis. In 
order to investigate if mitochondria enter HOS cells by macropinocytosis, cells were analysed for colocalisation 
between EGFP-labelled mitochondria and 70kDa Texas Red-dextran during internalisation assays using micros￾copy. EGFP-labelled mitochondria were found to colocalise with Texas Red-dextran during internalisation into 
cells (Fig. 4A). After coincubating 70 kDa Texas Red-dextran with EGFP-labelled mitochondria for 10min, slice 
views through a HOS cell showed colocalisation of two separate EGFP-labelled mitochondria with a globular 
collection of Texas Red-dextran (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, quantification of colocalisation between EGFP-labelled

mitochondria and Texas Red dextran in confocal images indicated highly overlapping signals (Fig. 4B). This sug￾gests that EGFP-labelled mitochondria and 70 kDa dextran are internalised by the same endocytic route, again

Confocal imaging shows that isolated mitochondria are associated with cellular structures char￾acteristic for macropinocytosis. Finally, imaging studies were carried out during internalisation assays, 
which were capable of showing features specific to macropinocytosis. We examined whether mitochondria are 
associated with membrane ruffles and macropinosomes, since these structures are characteristic of macropino￾cytosis. We used confocal microscopy to analyse HOS cells incubated with EGFP-labelled mitochondria and 
100nM EGF, followed by staining with phalloidin for F-actin, as membrane ruffles are F-actin rich. These cells had 
ridge-like membrane ruffles on their dorsal surfaces, which were engulfing EGFP-labelled mitochondria (Fig. 5A).
Macropinosomes are large vesicles formed by the closure of membrane ruffles at the cell surface. Newly 
formed macropinosomes are transiently associated with a circular coat of F-actin. This feature of early macropi￾nosomes is commonly used to identify them37. To determine if internalised mitochondria are found within mac￾ropinosomes, we used confocal microscopy, examining HOS cells incubated with EGFP-labelled mitochondria 
and 100nM EGF. We observed EGFP-labelled mitochondria inside large vesicles (~0.8 μm in diameter), which 
were surrounded by F-actin arranged into a circular configuration (Fig. 5B). These results provide further evi￾dence that exogenous mitochondria are internalised by macropinocytosis.
Discussion
Multiple endocytic pathways operate within cells and it is necessary to analyse all known features for an endocytic 
pathway when investigating if a cargo is internalised by a particular route. Collectively these different lines of 
evidence can robustly indicate that the entry of a cargo is mediated by a particular pathway.
We have shown that isolated mitochondria enter HOS cells by macropinocytosis using a number of different 
approaches including endocytic inhibitors, macropinocytic agonists, colocalisation assays with known macropi￾nocytic cargo molecules and imaging to demonstrate labelled mitochondria both interacting with membrane 
ruffles and also enclosed within macropinosomes. These independent lines of evidence all indicate that mito￾chondria enter HOS cells by macropinocytosis.
However, it is possible that mitochondria enter HOS cells by another pathway called phagocytosis, which 
internalises large extracellular particles. Phagocytosis uses pseudopod plasma membrane extensions to 
engage with cargo. Multiple direct receptor-mediated interactions are required between the pseudopods and 
an opsonised particle (opsonins are molecules which bind to antigen surfaces marking them as targets for the 
immune response) for successful internalisation. Moreover, specialised receptors FcRs (usually found on cells of 
the immune system) or CR3 complement receptors are required to mediate the interaction between the phago￾cytic cell and the particle surface38-40. We studied mitochondrial internalisation in human osteosarcoma cells. As 
non-immune system cells, they are unlikely to be able to phagocytose since they lack both FcRs and sources of 
opsonins (such as immunoglobulin or complement) required to activate this pathway. In addition, our data show 
that mitochondrial entry in HOS cells is enhanced by EGF, which is consistent with internalisation occurring by 
macropinocytosis. There is no evidence that EGF is able to upregulate phagocytosis in non-immune system cells.
We have also shown that endocytic transfer can be used to stably repopulate ρ0
 HOS cells with intact ρ+ mito￾chondria. Therefore, macropinocytosis can be used to deliver mitochondria to cells in order to alter their mito￾chondrial content. Importantly, in this study we have shown that mitochondrial internalisation can be enhanced 
with EGF, a macropinocytic stimulator. Our data indicate that stimulating the macropinocytic pathway is able to 
promote mitochondrial entry in HOS cells. Perhaps, upregulating macropinocytic signalling, not necessarily by 
EGF, might be considered as an approach for improving the efficiency of mitochondrial internalisation by cells. 
This could be applied in studies using isolated mitochondria as therapeutic agents.
The main aim of using EGF in some of our experiments was to enhance underlying levels of macropinocytosis 
and make it easier to capture features and structures pertaining to this process during mitochondrial internali￾sation assays. Other studies have used EGF mediated stimulation of macropinocytosis to show that cargo such 
as exosomes are internalised by this pathway33,34. If mitochondria were not internalised by this process, these 
macropinocytic characteristics would be unlikely to be detected in association with mitochondria, even in the 
presence of EGF.
Although we have provided robust evidence for the mechanism of mitochondrial entry into HOS cells, it 
is unclear if other human cell types are able to internalise mitochondria using the same mechanism. Also, it is 
uncertain how these mitochondria are incorporated into the recipient cell mitochondrial population. After inter￾nalisation, mitochondria must escape the endocytic compartment in order to re-enter the cytoplasm. It is unlikely 
that they they perform OxPhos within the acidic environment of an endosome. Our data and that of others13,18,20
showing that imported mitochondria are both functional and stably maintained in recipient cells suggests that 
mitochondria can escape the endomembrane system without being degraded. However, the mechanisms of this 
process remain unknown. Internalised material from most endocytic pathways are routed into the endosomal 
pathway41. This membrane bound compartment is involved in the sorting, processing and recycling of endocy￾tosed cargo42. There is evidence that pathogens entering cells by endocytosis escape from the endosomal com￾partment into the cytoplasm. For example, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is released into the cytoplasm from 
late endosomes by back-fusion of endosomal carrier vesicles containing virus with the endosomal membrane43. 
Therefore, it is possible that internalised mitochondria are also returned to the cytoplasmic compartment, allow￾ing them to join the recipient cell mitochondrial network (Fig. 5C). Further work might involve using imaging 
techniques to map the route of internalised mitochondria through the endosomal pathway and determine their 
destinations in the cell.
Studying the processes involved in mitochondrial internalisation has become more relevant, with interest in 
using mitochondria as therapy for diseases such as acute lung injury, heart attacks and stroke5,8,44. Recent evidence 
also suggests that intercellular mitochondrial transfer promotes tumour growth in vivo45. Strategies for interfer￾ing with this process could provide novel therapeutic interventions against cancers. Although extensive work is

necessary to fully investigate the therapeutic benefits of such treatments, methods of enhancing mitochondrial 
internalisation by target cells may be important in optimising mitochondrial therapies.
Several different approaches for delivering mitochondria to mammalian cells exist. These include cybrid generation46, 
intracellular microinjection of mitochondria47, creating transient pores within cell plasma membranes using a 
photothermal nanoblade20 and using a magnetic field to move mitochondria attached to magnetic beads into 
cells48. Of the currently available techniques, using macropinocytosis for mitochondrial transfer exploits a phys￾iological process in many cell types and allows simultaneous delivery of mitochondria to multiple cells without 
introducing foreign material. Therefore, macropinocytosis may be better suited for delivering mitochondria to 
cells for in vivo applications. However, much additional work needs to be done to evaluate mitochondrial delivery 
approaches within in vivo models.

cells showing potential downstream trafficking events. After entering the cell in macropinosomes, internalised 
mitochondria are likely to join the endosomal system. Early endosomes mature into late endosomes. These can 
fuse with lysosomes to produce endolysosomes, leading to degradation of their contents. Some internalised 
mitochondria must escape the endosomal compartment in order to return to the cytoplasm. This might occur 
by lysis of the endosome, but at the moment the mechanisms remain unknown.

Cell lines and cell culture conditions. HOS ρ+ cells were grown in DMEM with 10% FCS, streptomycin 
(100 μg/ml) and penicillin (100U/ml). HOS ρ0
 and HEK293T ρ0
 cells obtained by treatment of HOS cells with 
ethidium bromide in a standard, previously described method49. Also, these ρ0
 cells were unable to grow in a 
medium lacking uridine or a medium containing galactose as a sole carbon source50. Both types of ρ0
 cells were 
cultured in DMEM with 10% FCS, streptomycin (100μg/ml), penicillin (100U/ml) and uridine (50μg/ml).
To allow mitochondrial localisation of enhanced GFP (EGFP), a sequence coding for a mitochondrial tar￾geting sequence (MTS), from the human ATP5B gene (which encodes the F1β subunit of mitochondrial ATP 
synthase) was inserted in frame, at the 5′ end of the EGFP cDNA. The construct was cloned into the pcDNA5/
FRT/TO vector, after the addition of compatible restriction sites BamHI and EcoRV using PCR. Mitochondrial 
localisation of MTS-EGFP was verified by immunofluorescence (Fig. S6). A HEK293T cell line with tetracy￾cline inducible expression of mitochondrially targeted EGFP (HEK EGFP cells) was produced by co-transfecting 
HEK293T cells with pcDNA5/FRT/TO/MTS-EGFP and pOG44 and selecting for integration at the genomic 
FRT site. Expression of mitochondrially targeted EGFP by cells was induced using doxycycline (50 ng/ml) and 
this produced mitochondria that were labelled with EGFP. HEK293T EGFP cells were grown in DMEM with 10% 
Tet-
 FCS, blastocidin (10μg/ml) and hygromycin (50μg/ml).
Mitochondrial isolation. We have used the standard method for mitochondria isolation from cultured 
cells as described previously51,52. All mitochondrial isolation steps were performed on ice at 4 °C. HEK EGFP 
cells that had been induced with doxycycline 50ng/ml were harvested and collected by centrifugation for 5min 
at 400 g in a 5810R Eppendorf centrifuge. Cells were resuspended in hypotonic buffer (0.6M mannitol, 10 mM 
Tris, 1mM EDTA, 1mM PMSF and 0.1% BSA). They were lysed in a 3 ml homogeniser with 15 strokes per sample 
and then centrifuged at 400 g for 10min at 4 °C to remove debris. The supernatant was taken off, the remaining 
pellet resuspended in hypotonic buffer and re-homogenised. Supernatants from each successive spin were com￾bined and spun at 400 g for 5min to remove remaining debris. These supernatants were then spun at 11000 g for 
10min to pellet mitochondria. Pellets were resuspended in 100μl of hypotonic buffer without BSA. The quantity 
of mitochondria isolated from HEK293T GFP cells was determined using a BCA protein assay. The enrichment 
of mitochondria in the isolated fraction was measured by western blotting (Fig. S7).
Mitochondrial uptake assays. To select respiratory competent clones, the uptake assays were performed 
within an hour of mitochondrial isolation, with the mitochondrial fraction being kept at 4 °C in the isolation 
buffer before the procedure. Immediately before experiments, mitochondrial isolation buffer was removed from 
the pellet and mitochondria were resuspended in calcium free DMEM. HOS ρ+ cells were seeded at densities of 
1.5×105
 cells/ml in 6 well plates and grown in 800 μl of medium per well with supplementation of neomycin 
(500 μg/ml). Assays were performed after 24 hrs in confluent wells. Mitochondria isolated from ρ+ HEK 293T 
were added at a concentration of 125µg/ml to medium overlying HOS ρ0
 cells, incubated at 37°C in humidified air 
with 5% CO2. for 90min and then in calcium-free medium for 24hrs. Later medium was replaced by a standard 
DMEM supplemented with uridine and pyruvate for a further 24hrs. OxPhos competent HOS cells were selected 
in DMEM medium supplemented with pyruvate, neomycin and galactose, without uridine. Mitochondrial con￾centrations greater than 125 µg/ml did not result in a measurable increase of mitochondrial uptake efficiency.
For the FACS-based assays, HOS cells were pre-plated at 0.5×105
 in a 24 well plate. The medium was replaced 
with 150µl of calcium free medium prior to commencing the assay. HOS cells were incubated with inhibitors for 
30min at 37 °C. The following concentrations of inhibitors were used: dynasore 120μm, chlorpromazine (CPZ) 
100μm, MβCD 5mM, EIPA 50μm and wortmannin 300nM. Next, 500μg/ml µg of EGFP labelled mitochondria 
were then added to wells for 90, 60 and 30min with HOS cells. Control wells did not contain any inhibitor. On 
completion of the assay cells were detached with trypsin-EDTA and washed in PBS to remove any mitochondria 
attached to cell surfaces. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 400 g for 3min in a 5810R Eppendorf machine, 
then fixed in BD Cellfix and kept on ice.
FACS-based uptake assays. HOS cells samples that had been incubated with mitochondria were analysed 
with a Fortessa flow cytometer. FACS data were analysed using FlowJo software. A hierarchical gating system 
was applied to data to identify green fluorescent cells in samples. The single cell population was determined for 
each sample. Then fluorescence plots of non-fluorescent and green control cells (containing green fluorescent 
marker molecule or EGFP tagged mitochondria) were used to create gates to classify cells as green fluorescent or 
non-fluorescent. The gating for defining green fluorescent HOS cells was then applied to sample cell populations. 
In each FACS experiment, 10,000 events were examined, resulting in the analysis of 3000–6000 single cells per 
sample.
Immunofluorescence. HOS cells were grown on glass coverslips for 24 hrs. Mitochondrial uptake assays 
were carried out as described above. Cells were stained with CMAC cell tracker prior to fixing in 4% formalde￾hyde. Fixed cells were permeablised in 1% triton PBS and then blocked in a solution of 10% FCS in PBS (PBSS) for 
1hr. Cells were incubated with mouse anti-GFP antibodies at room temperature for 1.5hrs and then washed three

times in PBSS. Cells were then incubated with anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 for 1hr. At this stage Alexa Fluor 568 
phalloidin was added in some samples to stain F-actin. Slides were washed twice in PBSS and once in PBS. Slides 
were analysed by confocal microscopy (Nikon Ti microscope).
Microscopic examination of EGFP positive cell population. After mitochondrial uptake assays, the 
EGFP positive cell population was sorted by FACS and seeded onto coverslips. Between 1000–2000 EGFP positive 
cells from each incubation sample of 30min, 60min and 90min were seeded onto coverslips. Cells were allowed 
to attach overnight, stained with the cytoplasmic dye CMAC and fixed the next day. Cells were examined by con￾focal microscopy as described above to establish whether the EGFP signal in this sorted population came from 
inside the cell or from the cell surface.
Time-lapse microscopy. HOS cells were grown for 24 hrs in microslide wells. Cells were transfected 
overnight with pLifeAct-TagRFP using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 
Mitochondrial uptake assays were carried out in the transfected cells as described previously. Cells were then 
transferred to a microscope incubator at 37 °C and imaged dually with DIC and fluorescence.
Mitochondrial and nuclear genotyping. HEK293T, HOS cells and HOS cell clones after mitochondrial 
uptake were harvested and lysed. Cell lysates were treated with proteinase K and the total DNA was extracted 
using the protocol described by Reyes et al.
53. For nuclear genotyping regions including the SNP sites rs7171171, 
rs478582 and rs3087243 were sequenced to identify the alleles present within each cell line. In short, PCR 
amplification was performed using TaqGold DNA polymerase as per manufacturer’s instructions. PCR prod￾ucts were treated with Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase and exonuclease1. Sequencing reactions were performed 
using BigDye™ Terminator as per manufacturer’s instructions. Sequencing products were analysed using an ABI 
3700 DNA Analyser (Perkin Elmer Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and sequence traces analysed using the 
Staden package (http://staden.sourceforge.net/) to identify the alleles present at each SNP. The D-loop region of 
mt-DNA was amplified using PCR for mt-DNA genotyping. Primers:
ForD-loop: CGCAGTATCTGTCTTTGATTCCTGC
RevD-loop: ATTACACATGCAAGCATCCCCGTTC
Sanger sequencing was carried out by Beckmann-Coulter genomics.
Statistical analysis. FACS data from mitochondrial uptake assays were compared using unpaired t-tests in 
Excel software. Values averaged from at least 3 independent experiments were compared. A P-value<0.05 was 
considered significant.
