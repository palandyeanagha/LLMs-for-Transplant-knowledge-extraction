patients with different degrees of chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease

Abstract
Background: It is hypothesized that decreased capillarization of limb skeletal muscle is implicated in the decreased 
exercise tolerance in COPD patients. We have recently demonstrated decreased number of capillaries per muscle fibre 
(CAF) but no changes in CAF in relation to fibre area (CAFA), which is based on the diffusion distance between the 
capillary and muscle fibre. The aim of the current study is to investigate the muscle-to-capillary interface which is an 
important factor involved in oxygen supply to the muscle that has previously been suggested to be a more sensitive 
marker for changes in the capillary bed compared to CAF and CAFA.
Methods: 23 COPD patients and 12 age-matched healthy subjects participated in the study. Muscle-to-capillary 
interface was assessed in muscle biopsies from the tibialis anterior muscle using the following parameters:
1) The capillary-to-fibre ratio (C:Fi
) which is defined as the sum of the fractional contributions of all capillary contacts 
around the fibre
2) The ratio between C:Fi and the fibre perimeter (CFPE-index)
3) The ratio between length of capillary and fibre perimeter (LC/PF) which is also referred to as the index of tortuosity.
Exercise capacity was determined using the 6-min walking test.
Results: A positive correlation was found between CFPE-index and ascending disease severity with CFPE-index for 
type I fibres being significantly lower in patients with moderate and severe COPD. Furthermore, a positive correlation 
was observed between exercise capacity and CFPE-index for both type I and type IIa fibres.
Conclusion: It can be concluded that the muscle-to-capillary interface is disturbed in the tibialis anterior muscle in 
patients with COPD and that interface is strongly correlated to increased disease severity and to decreased exercise 
capacity in this patient group.
Introduction
COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) is a dis￾ease characterized by irreversible airflow obstruction [1].
A significant number of patients with COPD develop
skeletal muscle wasting and decreased exercise capacity
[2-5]. Previous studies have demonstrated the occurrence
of a shift towards fatigue-susceptible anaerobic glycolytic
muscle properties relative to the aerobic oxidative muscle
properties [6-9]. We have previously shown that changes
in fibre type composition occur in the later stages of
COPD while exercise capacity is decreased already in
mild and moderate COPD, indicating that other factors
also may influence decreased exercise capacity in these
patients [10]. Exercise tolerance is partly dependent on
the oxidative capacity of the skeletal muscle and an
important limiting factor for exercise capacity in COPD
is the oxygen supply to the muscle [11]. The oxidative
metabolism in skeletal muscle is dependent on the mito￾chondrial volume density and activity and on the capil￾lary supply. Therefore alterations in muscle capillary
network or mitochondria can cause decreased exercise
tolerance in COPD. Indeed, a previous study has reported
lower mitochondrial volume density but no changes in

mitochondrial respiratory function in patients with
COPD [12]. Furthermore, three previous studies have
suggested a decreased number of capillaries/muscle fibre
(CAF) in patients with COPD [8,9,13]. However, it is
important to highlight the fact that the ratio between the
number of capillaries and the area of muscle fibres
(CAFA) is not significantly altered in COPD patients
[8,9,13]. This finding can be explained by a reduction in
fibre area as previously shown in COPD patients [10].
This is also in line with a previous study [9] indicating a
parallel reduction in the number of capillaries around the
fibre and the area of the muscle fibre in COPD patients.
Therefore based on the capillary parameter CAFA, mus￾cle capillarization is not decreased in COPD patients.
The capillary supply is usually assessed by counting the
number of capillaries around each fibre (CAF) or by com￾puting the ratio between CAF and the area of the muscle
fibre (CAFA). CAFA is a parameter based on the diffu￾sion distance between the capillary and the centre of the
fibre. Capillary parameters essentially determining the
diffusion distance may not detect actual disturbances in
muscle capillarization. It has previously been suggested
that the muscle-to-capillary interface is an important fac￾tor involved in oxygen supply to the muscle [14-19] and
may thereby be used as a more sensitive marker for
changes in the capillary bed compared to CAF and CAFA
[15,16]. To asses muscle-to-capillary interface precise ste￾reological procedures such as the capillary-to-fibre
perimeter ratio have been used [20]. Some stereological
methods cannot be used in human studies since muscle
samples need to be perfused and fixed in order not to col￾lapse. However, capillary-to-fibre ratio for an individual
fibre (C:Fi
) can be assessed by determining the number of
capillaries around the fibre and the sharing factor (SF) for
each fibre and thereafter calculating the sum of the frac￾tional contributions of each capillary contact. Thereafter
the capillary-to-fibre perimeter exchange index (CFPE￾index) can be calculated as the quotient C:Fi and fibre
perimeter [19]. As CFPE-index has been shown to be cor￾related to precise stereological methods it can be used to
assess muscle fibre-to-capillary interface in human stud￾ies [15,19].
Measuring the percentage of fibre perimeter in contact
with the capillary wall (index of tortuosity (LC/PF))
which is based on the length of capillaries, the number of
capillaries and the perimeter of the fibre is another sensi￾tive method for assessment of muscle-to-capillary inter￾face which also takes in account the capillary geometry
[21]. To our knowledge CFPE-index and LC/PF have not
been evaluated in COPD and the question of whether
muscle-to-capillary interface is altered in this patient
group remains unknown.
Given earlier reports suggesting disturbed limb skeletal
muscle capillarization in COPD patients [8,13] the cur￾rent study aim was to examine the muscle-to-capillary
interface in different stages of COPD and its correlation
with the degree of airflow obstruction and exercise
capacity.

malignancy, cardiac failure and severe endocrine-,
hepatic- or renal disorder. Based on the severity of airflow
obstruction the patients were divided into three sub￾groups based on the "Global Initiative for Chronic
Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD)" criteria [1]. Eight
patients (four males and four females) had mild COPD
(forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1.0 ) > 80% of pre￾dicted), nine patients (two males and seven females) had
moderate COPD (FEV1.0 30-80% of predicted) and six
patients (four males and two females) had severe COPD
(FEV1.0 < 30% of predicted). Twelve age-matched, healthy,
non-smoking subjects (n = 12, 6 male, 6 female) were
recruited as a control group (Table 1).
Written informed consent was obtained from all sub￾jects before their participation in the study, which was
approved by the Ethics Board of Uppsala University, Swe￾den (dnr 2004:M-355).
Pulmonary function tests
All patients and age-matched healthy subjects underwent
a spirometry with reversibility test to determine FEV1.0
with the highest value from at least three technically
acceptable assessments being used.
Blood samples
All participants were sampled for arterial blood gases
from the radial artery at rest. The samples were analysed
for partial arterial pressure for oxygen (PaO2) and carbon
dioxide (PaCO2).
Exercise capacity test
Exercise capacity was determined using a 6 min walking
test performed on a 25 meter "court" as previously
reported [10] (Table 1).
Muscle samples
Muscle biopsies were obtained from the bulk of the tibia￾lis anterior muscle, which is an important postural mus￾cle active daily for long periods and involved in balance
control and foot stability during walking [22], under local
anaesthesia (Xylocaine®
2%) as previously described
[10,13,23]. The biopsies were frozen in isopentane cooled
to its freezing point in liquid nitrogen and stored in -80°C
until analyses were performed.
Immunohistochemistry
Serial transverse sections, 5 μm thick, were cut at -22°C
using a microtome (Leica CM1850, Leica Microsystems,
Germany) and mounted on glass slides. Muscle fibre
composition was determined by immunohistochemical
staining using the monoclonal antibodies N2.261 and
A4.951 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Uni￾versity of Iowa) [24] as previously described [10,13]
(Table 2). Fibres of type I, type IIa, type IIx, type IIx-a and
type IIa-b were determined. Fibre area and fibre perime￾ter for type I and type IIa fibres were determined on four
to ten randomly selected areas (table 2). For the visualiza￾tion of capillaries the monoclonal antibody CD31 (Dako,
Glostrup, Denmark; MO823) was used [13,16]. For visu￾alization of the fibre cytoplasm the histological staining
using eosin was applied. CD 31 has been used for the
identification of capillaries in several studies and a com￾parison between CD 31 staining and α-amylase-PAS for
identifying capillaries showed that the use of both meth￾ods results in a similar number of capillaries counted by
the observer and that CD31 staining allows an easier
visualization of capillaries [16]. Sequential estimation
analyses indicate that 50 fibres from one biopsy are suffi￾cient to characterise capillary parameters [25]. In the
present study capillaries in contact with oxidative type I
fibres and glycolytic type IIa fibres were analysed from
pictures taken with a magnitude of ×20 obtained from
four to ten randomly selected cross-sectional areas corre￾sponding to a mean of 80 fibres from each biopsy.
In a previous study we have reported the number of
capillaries around a single muscle fibre (CAF) and the
ratio between CAF and the fibre area (CAFA) [13] (table
2). The capillary parameters measured in transverse sec￾tions of the muscle biopsies in the present study were:
1) The capillary-to-fibre ratio (C:Fi
), which was calcu￾lated by determining the number of capillaries around for
the fibre in question followed by determination of the
sharing factor (SF) for each capillary and thereafter tak￾ing the sum of the fractional contributions of all capillary
contacts around the fibre [19].
2) The quotient between C:Fi and the fibre perimeter,
i.e. the CFPE-index [19]
3) The ratio between length of capillary and fibre
perimeter (LC/PF) which represents the percent of mus￾cle fibre perimeter in contact with capillary wall. LC/PF is
also referred to as the index of tortuosity [15,16].
Statistic analysis
Statistics were performed using Statistix®
8 (Analytic Soft￾ware, Tallahassee).
All data are presented as mean ± standard deviation.
For comparison between groups the Kruskal-Wallis one
way ANOVA test was used. When significance was found
the Kruskal-Wallis all pairwise comparison post-hoc test
was applied. Relationships between variables were stud￾ied using Spearmans rank correlation test. p < 0.05 was
considered to be significant.
Results
The following parameters associated with muscle-to-cap￾illary interface were assessed in the COPD population:
the capillary-to-fibre ratio (C:Fi
), the capillary-to-fibre

perimeter exchange index (CFPE-index) and the index of
tortuosity (LC/PF).
The C:Fi for type I fibres was significantly lower (p =
0.007) in the groups with moderate and severe COPD
compared with the age-matched healthy subjects and the
C:Fi for type IIa fibres was significantly lower (p = 0.002)
in the group with severe COPD compared to the age￾matched healthy subjects, indicating that each capillary is
shared by more muscle fibres in these patient groups
(Table 3). We also found that CFPE-index for type I fibres
was significantly lower (p = 0.002) in the groups with
moderate and severe COPD compared with the age￾matched healthy subjects (Table 3).
There were no significant differences in LC/PF between
the different groups (Table 3). However, the length of
capillaries in contact with type IIa fibres (LC type IIa) was
significantly lower (p = 0.03) in the group with moderate
COPD compared to healthy subjects.
A positive correlation was seen between the degree of
airflow obstruction expressed as percent of predicted
FEV1.0 and CFPE-index for both type I fibres (r = 0.61, p <
0.001) and type IIa fibres (r = 0.37, p = 0.04) (Fig 1) likely
indicating that each capillary is shared by more muscle
fibres when airflow obstruction increases.
A positive correlation was observed between exercise
capacity, expressed as distance walked in six minutes, and
CFPE-index for both type I fibres (r = 0.67, p < 0.001) and
type IIa fibres (r = 0.40, p = 0.02) (Fig 2) indicating a par￾allel reduction in exercise capacity and muscle capillar￾ization. Exercise capacity, expressed as distance walked in
six minutes, was also found to correlate positively to PaO2
(r = 0.57, p < 0.001) (Fig 3).
Discussion
Previous studies have suggested alterations in the capil￾lary bed of skeletal muscle in COPD patients. Extending
these findings the current study provides first evidence of
a disturbed muscle-to-capillary interface expressed as
CFPE-index in COPD. Additionally, we offer evidence for
a positive correlation between the degree of muscle capil￾larization, degree of airflow obstruction and exercise
capacity in COPD patients.
The presence of an adequate capillarization is essential
for maintenance of adequate oxygen supply required for
normal muscle function. Recently, we have demonstrated
an increased proportion of type IIa fibres and a decreased
proportion of type I fibres in the tibialis anterior muscle
of patients with COPD [10]. This is in line with previous
studies [3,7-9] and together with previous findings of a
decrease in oxidative enzyme activities in COPD [6,7] our
findings indicate the occurrence of a shift towards a more
glycolytic profile in the limb muscle of COPD patients.
Furthermore, the number of capillaries around a single
muscle fibre (CAF) was decreased in patients with COPD
compared to healthy subjects, indicating decreased mus￾cle capillarization in COPD [13]. However, CAF in rela￾Table 2: Fibre type distribution, fibre area, fibre perimeter, CAF and CAFA for type I and type IIa fibres.

tion to fibre area (CAFA) did not differ between healthy
subjects and patients with COPD [13]. Capillary parame￾ters essentially determining the diffusion distance (capil￾lary density or CAFA) may, thus, reflect the reduction in
fibre area in COPD patients [9,10] while disturbed capil￾larization may still be undetected. The current study has
investigated muscle to capillary interface in COPD
patients as this parameter is involved in oxygen supply to
the muscle and has been suggested to be a sensitive
marker for changes in the capillary network of limb mus￾cle [14-19]. Our results demonstrate a positive relation￾ship between the degree of airflow obstruction and
CFPE-index for both type I and type IIa fibres, indicating
that muscle capillarization decreases with increased dis￾ease severity. Furthermore, the CFPE-index for type I
fibres, but not for type IIa fibres, was significantly
reduced in patients with moderate and severe COPD
compared to healthy subjects. A larger capillary network
is associated with oxidative type I fibres compared to gly￾colytic type IIa fibres, which may explain why alterations
in CFPE-index are more evident in the type I fibres. Inter￾estingly, we found no differences in LC/PF between
COPD patients and healthy subjects. A main difference
between CFPE-index and LC/PF is that the calculation of

CFPE-index relies on the measurement of the capillary￾to-fibre ratio (C:Fi
, i.e. the sum of the fractional contribu￾tions of all capillary contacts around the fibre). We sug￾gest that the C:Fi is the capillary variable mainly affected
in COPD patients compared to healthy subjects i.e. each
capillary is shared by more muscle fibres. The specific
alterations of this variable may be due to the fact that it is
sensitive to alterations in the two-dimensional capillary￾fibre geometrical arrangement [19]. We speculate that
the presence of hypoxia in COPD leads to decreased oxy￾gen delivery to the muscle fibres which may lead to rear￾rangements of the capillary-fibre geometry. Still, the
mechanisms behind these rearrangements are not known
and further studies are needed to confirm these specula￾tions. However, as the CFPE-index is considered a sensi￾tive marker for changes in muscle-to-capillary interface
[16], we conclude that the interface is disturbed in the
tibialis anterior muscle of COPD patients. As it has previ￾ously been reported that muscle-to-capillary interface
measured as capillary-to-fibre surface ratio is regulated
as a function of the fibre mitochondrial volume per
length of fibre [26] another plausible explanation to our
findings may be a reduced mitochondrial volume of the
muscle fibre. This explanation would be in line with a
recent study showing a decrease in mitochondrial volume
in patients with COPD [12]. However, further studies on
the relationship between capillarization and mitochon￾drial volume density in COPD are needed to confirm this
hypothesis.
Recently, we have demonstrated that decreased exercise
capacity, as determined by the 6-min walking test, was
strongly correlated with increased severity of COPD (p >
0.001) [10]. Here, we extend these findings and show that
CFPE-index is also correlated to the degree of airflow
obstruction as determined by spirometry and to exercise
capacity determined by the 6-min walking test. In the
context of motor unit recruitment during different mus￾cular activities it is known that low intensity muscle activ￾ities mainly recruit low threshold slow, oxidative type I
fibres, while the high threshold more glycolytic type IIa
fibres are mainly recruited during high speed, high-force
generating muscle activities. As walking is considered a
low intensity activity the 6-min walking test recruits type
I fibres to a larger extent than type II fibres [27]. As dis￾turbance of the muscle-to-capillary interface is more pro￾nounced for type I fibres the correlation between exercise
capacity and CFPE-index is also stronger for type I fibres
than for type IIa fibres. This strongly suggests a contrib￾uting role for decreased muscle capillarization and subse￾quently impaired oxygen delivery in the development of
reduced exercise capacity in COPD. Indeed, a correlation
between reduced muscle oxygen supply and reduction in
exercise capacity in COPD has previously been suggested
[11]. However, the finding of a strong correlation between
exercise capacity and partial arterial pressure for oxygen
indicates that other factors such as lung disease also are
limiting factors for exercise capacity in COPD.
The mechanisms mediating decreased muscle capillar￾ization in COPD are unknown. However, it is known that
skeletal muscle adapts to physiological stimuli such as
exercise and environmental factors such as hypoxia by
changes in microvascularization [28,29]. As it has previ￾ously been suggested, one plausible explanation to the
decreased capillarization may be the lower physical activ￾ity levels in COPD patients [30]. Another explanation to
the findings in the present study may be the presence of
hypoxia in COPD. This hypothesis is strengthened by a
recent study where we have demonstrated an overexpres￾sion of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein
(pVHL) in the tibialis anterior muscle of patients with
COPD [13]. Increased pVHL may have an adverse effect
on tissue capillarization as it impairs transduction of
hypoxic-angiogenetic transcription factors including vas￾cular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [13,31]. Indeed,
evidence for attenuation of VEGF gene expression during
long term exposure to hypoxia has previously been dem￾onstrated in skeletal muscle of rats [32]. Additionally, pre￾vious studies examining the effect of hypoxia on skeletal
muscle have suggested that short term exposure to
hypoxic conditions leads to an increase in capillaries/
muscle fibre which is explained by a reduction in muscle
fibre area and not by capillary neoformation [29,33,34].
During chronic exposure to hypoxia an actual reduction
in muscle capillarity has been reported [29,35]. Taken
together, these findings indicate that the presence of a
hypoxic state may account for decreased skeletal muscle
capillarization in COPD. However, further studies are
needed to confirm this theory.
In conclusion, the present study provides evidence of a
positive correlation between decreased muscle-to-capil￾Figure 3 Relationship between exercise capacity expressed as

lary interface and increased disease severity in COPD.
Furthermore, a positive correlation is demonstrated
between decreased muscle-to-capillary interface and
decreased exercise capacity in patients with COPD. Exer￾cise is known to have a positive effect on muscle-to-capil￾lary interface [16], which highlights the need to develop
rehabilitation strategies to promote capillarization,
improve oxygen delivery and consequently improve exer￾cise capacity in COPD patients.
