Abstract
As compared with values in white subjects, bone mass is
known to be increased and urinary calcium to be diminished
in black individuals. To evaluate the possibility that these
changes are associated with alterations in the vitamin D￾endocrine system, an investigation was performed in 12 black
subjects, 7 men and 5 women, and 14 white subjects, 8 men
and 6 women, ranging in age from 20 to 35 yr. All of them
were hospitalized on a metabolic ward and were given a
constant daily diet containing 400 mg of calcium, 900 mg of
phosphorus, and 110 meq of sodium. Whereas mean serum
calcium, ionized calcium, and phosphate were the same in the
two groups, mean serum immunoreactive parathyroid hormone
(350±34 vs. 225±26 pg/ml, P < 0.01) and mean serum 1,25-
dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) (41±3 vs. 29±2 pg/ml, P
< 0.01) were significantly higher, and mean serum 25-hydroxy￾vitamin D (25-OHD) was significantly lower in the blacks
than in the whites (6±1 vs. 20±2 ng/ml, P < 0.001). Mean
urinary sodium and 24-h creatinine clearance were the same
in the two groups, whereas mean urinary calcium was signifi￾cantly lower (101±14 vs. 166±13 mg/d, P < 0.01) and mean
urinary cyclic AMP was significantly higher (3.11±0.47 vs.
1.84±0.25 nM/dl glomerular filtrate, P < 0.01) in the blacks.
Further, the blacks excreted an intravenous calcium load, 15
mg/kg body weight, as efficiently as the whites (49±3 vs.
53±3%, NS). Mean serum Gla protein was lower in blacks
than in whites (14±2 vs. 24±3 ng/ml, P < 0.02), and increased
significantly in both groups in response to 1,25(OH)2D3, 4 gg/
d for 4 d. There was a blunted response of urinary calcium to
1,25(OH)2D3 in the blacks, and mean serum calcium did not
change. The results indicate that alteration of the vitamin D￾endocrine system with enhanced renal tubular reabsorption of
calcium and increased circulating 1,25(OH)2D as a result of
secondary hyperparathyroidism may contribute to the increased
bone mass in blacks. Their low serum 25-OHD is attributed
to diminished synthesis of vitamin D in the skin because of
increased pigment.
Introduction
Available evidence indicates that bone mass is increased in
black as compared with white subjects (1, 2). Skeletal devel￾opment of black children is advanced in comparison to that
of white children, and black children exhibit greater body size
through adolescence (3-6). Based on radiographic measure￾Dr. Bell is a Veterans Administration Medical Investigator. Address

ments of metacarpal cortical area, blacks have a greater skeletal
mass than whites from age 1-80 yr (6, 7). As compared with
whites, blacks also have a lower urinary calcium (8). In view
of these observations, we carried out studies to determine
whether the increased bone mass and reduction in urinary
calcium in blacks is associated with changes in the vitamin D￾endocrine system.
Methods
26 normal subjects were studied. There were 12 blacks (seven men
and five women) and 14 whites (eight men and six women) who
ranged in age from 20 to 35 yr of age. All of them were hospitalized
in the General Clinical Research Center of the Medical University of
South Carolina. They were given only distilled water to drink and a
constant daily diet estimated to contain 400 mg calcium, 900 mg
phosphate, 18 meq magnesium, 110 meq sodium, and 65 meq
potassium. Fasting blood samples were collected at intervals for
measurement of serum calcium, ionized calcium, inorganic phosphate,
magnesium, creatinine, Gla protein, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD),
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D), and immunoreactive parathy￾roid hormone (PTH),' and 24-h urines were collected for measurement
of calcium, inorganic phosphate, sodium, potassium, magnesium,
creatinine, and cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP).
The study protocol was as follows. The first 2 d were a control
period. On the third day, calcium gluconate, 15 mg of calcium per
kilogram body weight, was given intravenously over a period of 8 h in
5% dextrose in water beginning at 8:00 a.m. The fourth day was a
control period. On days 5-8, 1,25(OH)2D3, 2 Ag by mouth every 12
h, was given on each of the 4 d.
Serum and urinary calcium (9), inorganic phosphate (10), creatinine
(11), and magnesium (12) were measured by automated methods.
Serum-ionized calcium was determined with a solid state ion electrode.
Urinary sodium and potassium were determined by flame photometer.
Serum 25-OHD was measured in duplicate at two concentrations by
competitive protein binding with vitamin D-deficient rat serum (13)
after extraction with acetonitrile, washing with phosphate buffer,
chromatography on C-18 Sep-Pak, and elution with acetonitrile (14).
25-OHD was separated from other vitamin D metabolites before the
binding assay by chromatography on silica Sep-Pak and elution with
hexane-propanol (96:4) (14). Serum 1,25(OH)2D was measured by the
method of Reinhardt et al. (14). Serum immunoreactive PTH was
measured by radioimmunoassay with a COOH-terminal specific anti￾body from chicken 77125 at a dilution of 1:10,000 (15). Serum Gla
protein was determined by radioimmunoassay (16). Urinary cAMP
was measured by radioassay with a binding protein (17). Results are
expressed as nanomolar per deciliter glomerular filtrate (GF) (18).
Statistical analyses were performed by standard methods for paired
and nonpaired t tests with an Apple Ile computer.

higher values for mean serum immunoreactive PTH and mean
serum 1,25(OH)2D as compared with whites (Table I). Mean
serum calcium, serum-ionized calcium, serum phosphate, and
serum magnesium were the same in the two groups. Mean
serum 25-OHD, obtained on day 1 of the study, was signifi￾cantly lower in the blacks than in the whites. During the initial
2-d control period, mean urinary calcium, phosphate, potas￾sium, and magnesium were significantly lower in the blacks,
their mean urinary cAMP was significantly higher, and mean
urinary sodium and creatinine clearance were the same in the
two groups (Table II). Renal excretion of calcium after infusion
of the ion, 15 mg of calcium per kilogram of body weight,
was the same in the two groups (Fig. 1). The mean excretion
of the administered calcium was 49±3% in the blacks and
52±3% in the whites (NS). Mean serum calcium was the same
in the two groups before infusion (Table I) and was significantly
higher in the blacks than in the whites at the end of the
infusion (13.3±0.2 vs. 12.2±0.1 mg/dl, P < 0.001). Mean
urinary cAMP declined significantly during the calcium infusion
in both groups, from 3.11±0.47 to 1.15±0.20 nM/dl GF in
the blacks (P < 0.01) and from 1.84±0.25 to 1.14±0.19 nM/
dl GF in the whites (P < 0.05).
In response to 1,25(OH)2D3 4 gg/d for 4 d, mean serum
calcium did not change (Table III), but mean urinary calcium
increased in both groups (Table IV). Urinary calcium was
consistently higher in the whites, and the increment in response
to 1,25(OH)2D3 was greater in them. Mean serum phosphate
increased significantly (Table III), and there was a transient
increase on day 5 in urinary phosphate in response to
1,25(OH)2D3 in both groups (Table IV). Urinary phosphate
was higher in the whites than in the blacks during treatment
with 1,25(OH)2D3. Mean serum Gla protein was significantly
lower in the blacks than in the whites before 1 ,25(OH)2D3,
and increased significantly in response to 1,25(OH)2D3 in both
groups (Table III). Urinary cAMP was reduced on the last day
of 1,25(OH)2D3 administration as compared with the first two
control days (Table II), averaging 1.50±0.29 nM/dl GF in the
blacks and 1.10±0.23 nM/dl GF in the whites (NS).
There were no significant differences in any of the mea￾surements between white men and white women and between
black men and black women (data not shown).
Discussion
Our results provide evidence for secondary hyperparathyroidism
in normal young black adult subjects. There were significant
increases in mean serum immunoreactive PTH, urinary cAMP,
and serum 1,25(OH)2D. These changes occurred in the absence
of any alterations in mean serum ionized and total calcium
and serum phosphate. Further, serum Gla protein, a bone
marker that varies directly with parathyroid status, which is
elevated in patients with hyperparathyroidism and diminished
in individuals with hypoparathyroidism (19), was lower in the
blacks than in the whites despite the increased values for
serum immunoreactive PTH in the blacks. Taken together,
these results provide evidence for alteration in the vitamin D￾endocrine system in blacks. The fact that serum Gla protein
increased in response to 1,25(OH)2D3 in both the blacks and
whites indicates that the skeleton is normally responsive to
1,25(OH)2D3 in blacks.
Our findings also indicate that reduced urinary calcium in
blacks (8) results from secondary hyperparathyroidism. A
calcium load, which produced hypercalcemia and caused com￾parable suppression of urinary cAMP in the blacks and whites,
was excreted equally well by the two groups. Had the decrease
in urinary calcium been caused by a renal tubular defect, there
should have been a delay in the renal excretion of calcium in
the blacks. This did not occur.
Mean serum 25-OHD was lower in the blacks than in the
whites. This difference could resuit from feedback inhibition
of hepatic synthesis of 25-OHD by the increased circulating

1,25(OH)2D in the blacks (20). However, regulation has not
been demonstrated to occur at low concentrations of serum
25-OHD. Diminished dermal synthesis of vitamin D from 7-
dehydrocholesterol because of absorption of photons of light
energy by skin pigment in the blacks is, therefore, a more
likely explanation (21).
The question arises whether the secondary hyperparathy￾roidism in blacks results from factors that are intrinsic or from
factors that are extrinsic to the skeleton. The increase in bone
mass in blacks is attributed to increased muscle mass (2). The
explanation that increased strain on the skeleton modifies the
response to PTH in blacks is open to question, in view of the
fact that skeletal mass is greater in men than in women, and
the fact that there were no differences in values for serum
immunoreactive PTH and serum 1,25(OH)2D in the men and
women in the present study. Nevertheless, if increased strain
on the skeleton does diminish its response to PTH, then
biochemical changes similar to those we have observed in
blacks might be present in obese subjects.
It was shown previously that serum immunoreactive PTH
is abnormally increased in obese subjects, and that the values
returned to the normal range with weight loss that was
produced by intestinal bypass (22). Further, the weight loss
and decrease in circulating immunoreactive PTH correlated
with each other. Our preliminary studies show significant
increases in mean serum immunoreactive PTH, serum
1,25(OH)2D, and urinary cAMP, and significant decreases in
mean serum 25-OHD and urinary calcium in obese as com￾pared with nonobese white subjects (23). The values are similar
to those obtained in nonobese blacks in the present study. We
attribute the decrease in serum 25-OHD in obesity to inhibition
of hepatic synthesis of the metabolite by elevated, circulating
1,25(OH)2D (20, 23). The finding that reduced serum 25-
OHD returned to normal in a group of obese subjects after
weight reduction produced by intestinal bypass (24) is consistent
with correction of secondary hyperparathyroidism (22) and
increased circulating 1,25(0H1)D by weight loss. Some studies
(25), but not others (24), show increases in bone mass in obese
subjects.
Several of our findings in the blacks remain to be elucidated.
Their urinary phosphate, potassium, and magnesium were
significantly decreased as compared with the whites. Reduction
of urinary potassium in blacks was reported previously and
may result from low plasma renin and aldosterone (26). It is
unlikely that the reduction in urinary magnesium is related to
secondary hyperparathyroidism, since renal handling of the
ion is not altered in patients with hyperparathyroidism or
hypoparathyroidism (27). The decrease in urinary phosphate
in the blacks was not anticipated in view of the increases in
serum immunoreactive PTH. It is likely that intestinal absorp￾tion of phosphate, potassium, and magnesium may be dimin￾ished in blacks as compared with whites by mechanisms yet
to be determined.
It could be argued that the increases in serum PTH, serum
1,25(OH)2D, and urinary cAMP, and the reduction in urinary
calcium in the blacks results from diminished intestinal ab￾sorption of calcium. This we regard as unlikely, since a
reduction in calcium absorption would eventually lead to a
decrease instead of the well-documented increase in bone mass
in blacks (1, 2). Also, our finding of a reduction rather than
an increase in mean serum Gla protein in the blacks, despite
increases in circulating PTH, is evidence for altered skeletal
response to the hormone. Nevertheless, it will be important to
compare calcium absorption and the response to exogenous
PTH in blacks and whites.
Finally, demonstration that intestinal absorption of calcium
is enhanced in blacks because of increased circulating
1,25(OH)2D, the major determinant of intestinal absorption
of calcium in man (28), would indicate that the vitamin D￾endocrine system is ideally programmed to spare the skeleton.

Thus, increased circulating PTH in blacks would augment
the intestinal absorption of calcium by increasing serum
1,25(OH)2D, and would prevent urinary loss of calcium by
enhancing the tubular reabsorption of the ion. Our central
hypothesis, which is still to be proven, is that strain on the
skeleton alters the vitamin D-endocrine system. In our view,
changes in the regulation of the vitamin D-endocrine system
in a given individual may determine in a major way whether
bone mass will be increased or decreased and whether osteo￾porosis will ensue.
