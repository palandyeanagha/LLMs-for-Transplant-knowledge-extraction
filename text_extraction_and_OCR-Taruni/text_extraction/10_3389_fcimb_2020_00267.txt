Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the most frequent cause of opportunistic viral
infection following transplantation. Viral factors of potential clinical importance include the
selection of mutants resistant to antiviral drugs and the occurrence of infections involving
multiple HCMV strains. These factors are typically addressed by analyzing relevant HCMV
genes by PCR and Sanger sequencing, which involves independent assays of limited
sensitivity. To assess the dynamics of viral populations with high sensitivity, we applied
high-throughput sequencing coupled with HCMV-adapted target enrichment to samples
collected longitudinally from 11 transplant recipients (solid organ, n = 9, and allogeneic
hematopoietic stem cell, n = 2). Only the latter presented multiple-strain infections. Four
cases presented resistance mutations (n = 6), two (A594V and L595S) at high (100%)
and four (V715M, V781I, A809V, and T838A) at low (<25%) frequency. One allogeneic
hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipient presented up to four resistance mutations,
each at low frequency. The use of high-throughput sequencing to monitor mutations
and strain composition in people at risk of HCMV disease is of potential value in helping
clinicians implement the most appropriate therapy.

Suárez et al. HCMV Resistance Mutations Evolution
INTRODUCTION
Despite continuous advances in diagnostics and therapy,
human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) remains the most frequent
opportunistic viral infection following transplantation,
contributing significantly to patient morbidity, and mortality
(Boeckh and Ljungman, 2009). The risk of developing HCMV
disease after transplantation depends on a number of host
factors, including the HCMV serological status of the donor
and the recipient, the type of transplant and the level of
immunosuppression. In addition, viral factors are associated with
poorer outcomes, including the selection of mutants resistant
to antiviral drugs and the occurrence of infections involving
multiple HCMV strains (Wu et al., 2010; Lisboa et al., 2012).
Viral factors are usually addressed by analyzing individual
HCMV genes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Sanger
sequencing. Resistance mutations can be screened in the
genes responsible for antiviral drug activity (typically UL54
encoding the viral DNA polymerase, and UL97 encoding a
phosphotransferase), whereas multiple-strain infections may be
detected by genotyping hypervariable genes (commonly UL73
encoding glycoprotein N [gN], UL74 [gO], and UL55 [gB]).
This strategy involves an independent assay for each gene
analyzed, and its sensitivity is generally limited to the detection
of subpopulations exceeding 20% of the total viral population
(Schuurman et al., 1999; Sahoo et al., 2013).
Monitoring the complexity of viral populations and the
dynamics of resistance mutations is critical to understanding the
evolutionary mechanisms operating on the virus during antiviral
selection. This is also clinically relevant because the presence of
cells infected with multiple strains provides an opportunity for
the virus to recombine (Rasmussen et al., 2003), which might
lead to an increase of viral strain pathogenicity. Moreover, the
presence of drug-resistant populations at low frequencies (<5%)
during the early stages of antiviral treatment may signal eventual
treatment failure when these populations come to predominate
at later stages (Chou et al., 2014; Houldcroft et al., 2016).

Indeed, continuation with the antiviral drug to which resistance
has developed can lead to the development of additional
resistance mutations (Lurain and Chou, 2010). In contrast,
therapy modification can accelerate viral clearance (Castagnola
et al., 2004). Thus, rapid, comprehensive and sensitive molecular
diagnostic approaches would be beneficial for assisting clinicians
in improving the management of HCMV infections.
The application of commercial target enrichment methods
coupled with the use of high-throughput sequencing (HTS)
has dramatically surpassed the sensitivity of PCR methods for
characterizing HCMV in clinical material (Hage et al., 2017;
Cudini et al., 2019; Suárez et al., 2019a,b). This approach has
the great advantage of allowing resistant populations and strain
numbers to be assessed across the whole viral genome in a single
assay. Studies employing analysis of individual HCMV genes by
PCR and HTS to detect antiviral resistance mutations in HCMV
infections have been reported (Sahoo et al., 2013; Chou et al.,
2014; Guermouche et al., 2020), but none has applied a whole￾genome approach. Moreover, sophisticated bioinformatic tools
have recently been developed to facilitate accurate interrogation
of HTS data for the presence of multiple HCMV strains
(Suárez et al., 2019a,b). Here, we used HTS and HCMV￾adapted bioinformatics resources to assess the dynamics of
HCMV viral populations in 11 transplant recipients undergoing
antiviral therapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sample Collection
Plasma (n = 42) and whole blood (n = 20) samples from
confirmed HCMV-infected transplant recipients (nine solid
organ transplants and two allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
transplants) were collected longitudinally during episodes of
viremia. They were collected at times following transplantation
or after HCMV reactivation ranging from 16 to 336 days,
and had viral loads ranging from 6.94 × 102
to 8.13 ×
106 HCMV international units per ml (IU/ml) of plasma

Suárez et al. HCMV Resistance Mutations Evolution
was prepared for sequencing using a library preparation kit
(KAPA Biosystems, London, UK) and following the SureSelectXT
version 1.7 target enrichment system (Agilent Technologies,
Santa Clara, CA, USA) as described previously (Hage et al., 2017;
Suárez et al., 2019b). Libraries were indexed using ultrapure
(TruGrade) oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies,
Leuven, Belgium), and loaded onto a NextSeq (Illumina, San
Diego, CA, USA) DNA sequencer to generate 2 × 150 bp paired￾ended reads.
Genome Assembly and Data Analysis
Sequencing data quality was enhanced by removing low￾quality regions from the reads using Trim Galore (http://www.
bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/) (length =
21, quality = 10, and stringency = 3). The remaining paired￾ended reads were screened for the presence of multiple HCMV
strains using a method based on detecting signatures unique to
the individual genotypes of hypervariable genes (Suárez et al.,
2019b). Briefly, multiple strains were assigned if at least two
genotypic signatures were found for at least two of the 12
hypervariable genes tested, and if these represented ≥2% of
the total number of reads having any genotypic signature of
these genes. In the datasets reflecting the presence of a single
strain (i.e., presenting single genotypic signatures in at least ten
hypervariable genes), the paired-ended reads were assembled
de novo using SPAdes 3.5.0 (Bankevich et al., 2012) after
removing reads mapping to the Genome Reference Consortium
Human Reference 38 sequence (http://genome.ucsc.edu/) using
Bowtie2 v.2.2.6 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012). The contigs
were then assembled into genomes using Scaffold_builder (Silva
et al., 2013) and the publicly available sequence of HCMV
reference strain Merlin (GenBank accession no. AY446894.2).
Subsequently, the reads were mapped to the respective assembled
genome using Bowtie2, and the alignments were inspected
visually using Tablet (Milne et al., 2013). Drug resistance
mutations within the antiviral target genes (UL54 and UL97)
were screened at two frequency levels: (1) at high frequency
by interrogating the UL54 and UL97 gene consensus sequences
of the assembled genomes using the online resource Mutation
Resistance Analyzer (Chevillotte et al., 2010), which employs
HCMV strain TB40/E as reference, and (2) at low frequency
by interrogating high-quality datasets (criteria are defined in
Results) mapped to corresponding assemblies using LoFreq
(Wilm et al., 2012). The latter analysis was conducted using a
conservative multi-step filtering approach aimed at minimizing
the detection of false positive variants. Briefly, read quality
was enhanced using Trim Galore with default parameters,
trimmed reads were deduplicated (i.e., duplicated reads were
removed) using FastUniq (Xu et al., 2012), and read quality
was further improved using PRINSEQ (Schmieder and Edwards,
2011) (minimum quality mean = 25, trimming quality left
= 30, trimming quality window = 5, trimming quality step
= 1, minimum length = 80, and trimming 3’ Ns = 20).
Imperfect poly-G tracts located at the 3’ ends of reads were
trimmed when a segment of 40 nucleotides contained >30 G
residues. Filtered sequencing reads were mapped to their
respective assemblies using Bowtie2 in end-to-end alignment

mode. Reads were further deduplicated on the basis of
alignment coordinates using Picard (http://broadinstitute.github.
io/picard/). Variants with a quality score of ≥30 were called from
the deduplicated alignments.
Data Deposition
Datasets were purged of human reads and deposited in the
European Nucleotide Archive (ENA; project no. PRJEB36759),
and the annotated consensus genome sequences were deposited
in GenBank (accession nos. MT044476-MT044485).
RESULTS
Quality Assessment of Sequencing
Libraries and Enumeration of Strains
A total of 62 sequencing libraries from 11 transplant patients
(2–10 samples per patient) were generated, with input HCMV
values ranging from 39 to 1.6 × 106
IU per library. Sequencing
yielded 7.6 × 106
to 24.5 × 106
trimmed reads per sample,
with 0–87% mapping to the HCMV reference strain Merlin
genome (Table S1, rows 14 and 15). When reads were mapped to
the strain Merlin genome, the average sequencing depth ranged
from 5 to 12,016 reads/nucleotide (nt), covering between 35
and 100% of the Merlin reference genome (Table S1, rows 16
and 17).
To examine library fragment diversity, the average sequencing
depth of reads mapped to the strain Merlin genome was
calculated after removing duplicates. The average sequencing
depth of unique reads ranged from 0.001 (low diversity) to
4,458 (high diversity) reads/nt (Table S1, row 18), and generally
reflected the number of HCMV genome copies in the input
material (Figure 2).
Using the previously published method for distinguishing
viral strains by monitoring the genotypes of hypervariable
genes (Suárez et al., 2019b), multiple HCMV strains were
detected in 15 datasets derived from three patients (SYD-1,

to 235,917 bp. Three genomes presented the complete set
of HCMV genes. The remaining seven genomes presented
mutations leading to premature termination of at least one
gene (most frequently RL5A), a proportion that is in line with
previous reports (Sijmons et al., 2015; Suárez et al., 2019b).
One genome presented four mutated genes, including UL111A
(encoding viral interleukin-10), one genome presented three
mutated genes, one genome presented two mutated genes,
and the remaining four genomes presented a single mutated
gene (Table 3).
Minor Variants and Resistance Mutations
HTS is highly PCR-dependent, which might lead to the
incorporation of artifactual variability into sequence datasets.
Consequently, only high-quality datasets, that is those with (1)
an average sequencing depth of all reads of ≥500 reads/nt, (2) an
average sequencing depth of unique reads of ≥10 reads/nt, and
(3) ≥95% coverage of the strain Merlin genome, were considered
for screening minor variants. In addition, only variants occurring
at a frequency of >2% were scored (Xu et al., 2017). Of the

seven solid organ transplant patients did not present resistance
mutations in either the UL97 or the UL54 gene. The assembled
genomes from both allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant
patients presented mutations at low levels (<25%) in the UL54
gene that are known to confer resistance to foscarnet and
ganciclovir (patient SYD-1: A809V; and patient SYD-2: V715M,
V781I, A809V, and T838A) (Table 6). However, only three of
these mutations were observed in samples collected from at least
two different time points from patient SYD-2 (V715M from day
166 to 219; V781I at days 177, 205, and 219; and A809V at days
198 and 205), whereas the rest were observed in samples taken at
a single time point (Table 6 and Figure 1).
DISCUSSION
The emergence of resistance mutations is one of the major risks
of antiviral therapy after transplantation (Emery and Griffiths,
2000). In addition, the presence of multiple-strain infections
has been linked to poorer outcomes in transplant recipients
(Coaquette et al., 2004; Manuel et al., 2009; Lisboa et al., 2012).
Therefore, recognizing the presence of resistance mutations
and multiple HCMV strains in patients, even at low levels,
would provide potentially important information to clinicians
for implementing the most appropriate antiviral therapy. Whole￾genome HTS makes it possible to screen for the presence of
minor variants (including resistance mutations) and the number
of viral strains in a single assay with an unprecedented level of
sensitivity. However, a comprehensive assessment of the data is
required, as sound interpretation is dependent on understanding
and monitoring a range of biological and technological factors
(Suárez et al., 2019b).
Here, the dynamics of HCMV genome variation were
examined in 11 transplant recipients, including solid organ
and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients.
As demonstrated in recent studies (Cudini et al., 2019; Suárez
et al., 2019b), the presence of multiple strains in clinical samples
(i.e., multiple-strain infections) results in gross overestimation
of HCMV genome variability within an individual host, as
the variants detected almost entirely reflect genetic differences
between the strains present rather than intrahost evolution of
any single strain. This conclusion was supported in the present
study by the much lower level of genome variability observed
in confirmed single-strain infections. In addition, sequencing
libraries with low diversity, which were usually derived from
samples with low viral loads, also presented a high number
of variants, possible due to the prolific incorporation of PCR
errors. These findings highlight the importance of ensuring
sound interpretation of data, particularly as HTS becomes more
widely applied to genotypic resistance testing. It is notable that
far more progress in applying HTS in the clinical setting has
been achieved in the HIV field, and yet numerous quality control
issues remain (Weber et al., 2019). In this study, we opted for
a conservative approach in assessing the data, by only analyzing
datasets meeting specific quality criteria, and scoring variants at
a frequency of >2%. In this regard, further studies focused on
evaluating accurate quality thresholds, assessing detection limits,
and exploring additional sources of misinterpretation are needed
in order to allow HTS technology to be applied confidently to
HCMV in the clinical setting.
As observed in this and previous studies (Hage et al., 2017;
Cudini et al., 2019; Suárez et al., 2019a,b), the HCMV genome
is highly stable in patients over time and during different
reactivation episodes (patients HAN-1, HAN-2, and HAN-3), as
indicated by the low number of variants detected in longitudinal
samples from single-strain infections (Figure 4). This finding
is consistent with the expression of a proof-reading DNA
polymerase by HCMV (Nishiyama et al., 1983), and contrasts
with previous studies characterizing HCMV as a fast-evolving
virus that readily generates variants in an individual host at
a frequency approaching that of RNA viruses such as HIV
(Renzette et al., 2013). These discrepancies, which may have
important clinical implications, may be explained by differences
in the sequencing technologies used, the analytical approaches
taken, and the clinical conditions analyzed.

strains may disrupt genome stability by providing opportunities

for recombination (Rasmussen et al., 2003; Sijmons et al.,
2015; Suárez et al., 2019b). Previous studies have demonstrated
that multiple-strain infections are common in allogeneic
hematopoietic stem cell and solid organ transplant recipients
and are associated with a worse outcome, including a higher
prevalence of HCMV disease and a higher rate of graft rejection.
Both allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients
analyzed in the present study presented multiple-strain (n = 2)
infections that may have resulted from the positive serological
status of both donor and recipient in each case or from the
higher level of immunosuppression that such patients typically
undergo in comparison to solid organ transplant recipients.
However, in order to derive an accurate incidence of multiple￾strain infections in transplantation, further studies are warranted
that would increase the sample size and represent the various
combinations of the serological status of the donor and recipient
in both solid organ and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
transplant cases.
Antiviral drugs may also promote disruption of genome
stability by stimulating the selection of variants in genes that
render the virus susceptible to those drugs. Approximately
40% of the cases analyzed in the present study developed
resistance mutations at various levels in UL54 and UL97. The
HCMV genomes sequenced from two solid organ transplant
cases (patients HAN-4 and HAN-5) contained fixed mutations
in UL97 (A594V and L595S, respectively) that confer resistance
to ganciclovir and valganciclovir. This finding is in line with
a previous report that the category of solid organ transplants
involving a seropositive donor and a seronegative recipient
(D+/R–), to which these two cases belonged, account for
the highest incidence of resistance (Lurain and Chou, 2010).
These mutations were also detected in these patients by Sanger
sequencing (Figure 1), but only at specific time points following
a recommended procedure (i.e., when the viral load had persisted
or increased after 2 weeks of antiviral therapy). However, these
mutations stayed fixed in the viral population, even after a
change of therapy (patient HAN-5). No resistance mutations
were detected in the remaining seven solid organ transplant
patients, even though these included three additional D+/R￾cases. The incidence of resistance mutations obtained in the

Suárez et al. HCMV Resistance Mutations Evolution
present study may not necessarily reflect the general situation,
as the number of cases analyzed in this study was limited
and included some cases (patients HAN-4 and HAN-5) with
previously recognized antiviral resistance mutations detected by
Sanger sequencing. In addition, our findings might also have
been influenced by the generation of a number of low quality
sequencing libraries, such as for patients HAN-2 and HAN-3,
or by a shorter time frame of sample collection, such as for
the GLA patients (maximum time frame of 31 days between
samples). The latter factor is particularly relevant because
detection of resistance mutations, except in the immunodeficient
pediatric population (Wolf et al., 1998; Houldcroft et al.,
2016), is unusual during the first 6 weeks of antiviral therapy
(Springer et al., 2005; Lurain and Chou, 2010).
In the present study, both allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
transplant recipients presented resistance mutations (V715M,
V781I, A809V, and T838A) at a low level (<25%) in UL54.
Mutation V715M, which confers resistance to foscarnet (Baldanti
et al., 1996), was detected in patient SYD-2 by Sanger sequencing
at day 114 post-transplant after a period of 41 days receiving
this antiviral drug. However, this method failed to detect the
same mutation 52 days later, as it was present at a low level
(6%) (Figure 1 and Table 6). Indeed, this mutation was never
cleared despite the change of therapy to ganciclovir or cidofovir.
There are several possible explanations for the resilience of
this mutation, including the administration of a suboptimal
drug dosage, the presence of compensatory mutations in a
different region of the HCMV genome, and host factors
associated with the level of immunosuppression. Also, in the
same patient, mutation V781I, which confers resistance to
foscarnet (Cihlar et al., 1998) and ganciclovir (Chou, 2011),
was first detected by HTS at 205 days after transplantation at
a frequency of <5%, soon after initiation of cidofovir. This
mutation was also detected by Sanger sequencing 25 days later
(a time point at which no HTS data were available), after
completion of cidofovir treatment and initiation of ganciclovir
administration. In contrast, mutation A809V, which confers
resistance to ganciclovir and foscarnet (Chou et al., 2007),
was detected by HTS at 198 days after transplantation and
remained for 7 days until being effectively cleared with the
initiation of cidofovir. The presence of multiple resistance
mutations simultaneously in the same patient, even at low
frequency, is of particular interest, as these mutations are
unlikely to be detected by traditional non-HTS methods (i.e.,
Sanger sequencing). Multiple resistance mutations occurring
at sub-fixation levels (i.e., present in <100% of the viral
population) can lead to a drug resistant phenotype (Chou
et al., 2014), a phenomenon that has been observed in fatally
immunocompromised pediatric patients (Houldcroft et al., 2016)
and solid organ transplant patients (Guermouche et al., 2020).
In such circumstances, novel HCMV-specific cell therapies may
offer an alternative intervention for patients with clinically
resistant disease, especially those found to have clinically
resistant HCMV associated with known resistance mutations
(Withers et al., 2017). These findings highlight the importance of
monitoring resistance mutations with high sensitivity during the
course of an antiviral regime, as those present at low level may
become prevalent at later stages due to a change to a regime that
selects them.
A number of other non-synonymous mutations in UL54
and UL97 were also detected in the cohort. Their capacity
to contribute to antiviral resistance is not known and is
worthy of further investigation. Moreover, we focused on
resistance mutations in UL54 and UL97 as these are the
target genes of the antivirals used in the cases analyzed.
The application of alternative drugs (Griffiths, 2019), targeting
different loci, such as maribavir (UL27) and letermovir
(the terminase complex consisting of UL56 and UL89), the
potential release of new antiviral drugs acting at other
essential HCMV genes, and the possible development of
compensatory mutations in other genomic regions, indicates
the usefulness of an assay capable of detecting mutations
throughout the whole genome, such as the one applied in
this study.
CONCLUSIONS
Improved treatment of HCMV-infected transplant patients
would benefit from more effective monitoring of host and viral
determinants. In this regard, HTS provides an opportunity
to carry out comprehensive analyses of the evolution of
resistance mutants and other minor variants in the HCMV
populations present in transplant recipients. The stability
of the viral genome in such patients may be perturbed
by the application of antiviral drugs or the presence of
multiple strains. Monitoring the development of resistance
mutations, even at a low frequency, is potentially of use in
assisting clinicians to implement the most appropriate antiviral
therapy at a time when it is most likely to be effective.
However, it is necessary to have a firm understanding of the
data, in terms of its quality and the ways in which it is
analyzed, in order to ensure that the conclusions are sound
and meaningful.
