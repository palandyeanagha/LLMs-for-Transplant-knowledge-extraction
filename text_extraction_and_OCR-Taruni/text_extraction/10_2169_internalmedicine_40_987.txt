Abstract
Objective The purpose of this study was to survey the
clinical characteristics, complications, and therapeutic out￾come in patients with acromegaly.
Patients and Methods The clinical features of 65 pa￾tients with acromegaly (31 males, 34 females; mean age:
50±2 yr.) who were admitted to Tokyo Women's Medical
University between 1990 and 1999 were analyzed retrospec￾tively from medical records.
Results The retrospective analysis revealed that the di￾agnosis of acromegaly was preceded by approximately
8.1±1.1 years of signs and symptoms of the disease. Forty￾six of the 65 patients (71 %) had macroadenomas, 16 (25%)
had microadenomas, and the remaining three had empty
sella. The rate of biochemical cure or remission was 81 %
for microadenoma (13/16), 64% for macroadenoma with￾out extrasellar extension (9/14), and 13% for macroade￾noma with cavernous sinus extension (2/15). Eighteen (28 % )
patients had impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and 32 (49 % )
had diabetes mellitus (DM). After treatment for acro￾megaly, glucose metabolism was analyzed again in 38
patients, and it improved in 26 patients with IGT or DM.
Twenty-five of 65 patients (38%) had hypertension. Of 26
patients whounderwentbariumenemaor colonoscopy, 10
had colonic polyps and 4 had colon cancer.
Conclusion This study suggests that long-term exces￾sive growth hormone (GH) secretion causes many compli￾cations. Therefore, awareness of the early symptomsand
signs of acromegaly and long-term careful managementof
complications, along with therapy to reduce serum GH/in￾sulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I levels, are important for
patients with acromegaly.

Introduction
Acromegaly, a disorder of growth hormone (GH) hyperse￾cretion, is usually caused by pituitary somatotroph adenoma.
Acral growth, coarsened facial features, and soft-tissue swell￾ing are the most commonsymptoms of acromegaly (1 , 2). Other
symptoms presenting in about half of the patients are head￾ache, visual field impairment, and peripheral neuropathy. Hy￾persecretion of GHalso induces various complications, espe￾cially diabetes mellitus and hypertension, which occur in 37%
and 23% of acromegalic patients, respectively (3). Persistent
excess GHsecretion in active acromegaly is associated with
progressive acral growth and organ overgrowth, and it also has
a high mortality rate (4, 5). The main causes of reduced life
expectancy are cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and respira￾tory disease. Moreover, high posttreatment GHlevels are as￾sociated with an increased mortality rate due to malignant dis￾ease (6). Transsphenoidal surgery is the primary therapy for
most patients with acromegaly. However, the surgical cure rate
for macroadenoma,which is the most commonGH-secreting
pituitary adenoma, is no more than about 50% (7). Therefore,
many patients, particularly those with large tumors, require
more than one type of treatment, including radiation, so￾matostatin analogs, or dopamineagonists, to achieve clinical
improvement and reduce serum GHlevels. In this study, in
order to survey the clinical characteristics, complications, and
therapeutic outcome in patients with acromegaly, we analyzed
the medical records of 65 consecutive patients whowere ad￾mitted to Tokyo Women's Medical University Hospital for treat￾ment of acromegaly between 1990 and 1999.

75 g oral glucose loading test (OGTT) and/or elevated serum
insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I levels. An OGTTwas not
performed in patients with overt diabetes mellitus (DM). Pitu￾itary magnetic resonance imaging and/or computed tomogra￾phy was performed in all patients.
Meth ods
Weused medical records to retrospectively analyze clinical
features, endocrinological data, complications, and outcome
for each patient.
Outcomewas classified depending on the degree of disease
control after therapy. "Biochemical cure" implied suppression
of serum GHto less than 1 ng/ml after 75 g OGTTand normal￾ization of serum IGF-I levels. Patients were classified as "re￾mission" if they demonstrated normalization of serum IGF-I
levels. Included in this group were: 1) patients who required
no medication after a combination of surgery and radiotherapy
because of normalization of serum IGF-I levels, 2) patients
who had normal IGF-I levels while receiving bromocriptine,
3) patients who had normal IGF-I levels but could not be stud￾ied with 75 g OGTTdue to overt DM, and 4) patients who had
normal IGF-I levels but whose serum GHlevels remained be￾tween 1 and 2 ng/ml after 75 g OGTT. Patients who had el￾evated serum IGF-I levels and whose serum GHlevels remained
between 1 and 2 ng/ml after 75 g OGTTwere classified as
"partial remission". Patients whose serum GHand IGF-I lev￾els had decreased but were still elevated higher than the nor￾mal range after therapy were classified as "poor control".
Until 1989, the serum GHconcentration was measured with
a commercially available radioimmunoassay (RIA) kit (Eiken
Chemical Co., Ltd.), and, since 1990, it has been measured with
a radio immunometric assay (IRMA) kit (Eiken Chemical Co.,
Ltd.). The minimum detectable serum GHlevel was 1 ng/ml
for RIA, and 0.1 ng/ml for IRMA. Until 1993, the plasma IGF￾I concentration wasmeasured with a RIAkit (Nichols Institute
Diagnostics, San Juan Capistrano, CA) without acid-ethanol
extraction. The normal adult range with this kit was 0.4-1.6 U/
ml. Since 1994, serum IGF-I concentration has been measured
with a different RIA kit (Ciba Corning Diagnostic Co., Ltd.).
The normal adult range with this kit is 106-398 ng/ml for men
and 121^36 ng/ml for women.
Hypercholesterolemia was considered if serum cholesterol
levels were higher than 220 mg/dl, and hypertriglyceridemia
was considered if serum triglyceride levels were greater than
150 mg/dl.
Sta tis tics
All data were expressed as mean± SEM.Achi-square test
was performed to investigate the relationship between gender
and tumor size. Anunpaired t test was performed to evaluate
the differences in serum GHand IGF-I levels between patients
with microadenomaand macroadenoma,respectively. Spear￾man'srank test wasused to assess the correlation betweense￾rum GHand IGF-I levels before therapy. Significance was es￾tablished at p<0.05. All statistical analyses were performed
using the Stat View 4.5 1 (Abacus Concepts Inc., Berkeley, CA).
Results
Patien t popula tions The mean age of the patients was 50 ± 2 (range: 19-74) yr.
Fifty-seven percent of the subjects were in their 50s and 40s
(Fig. 1). There were 31 (48%) male and 34 (52%) female pa￾tients. There were no deaths in this series from 1990 to 1999.
Clinical features
Theretrospective reviewrevealed that the meanduration of
symptoms of acromegaly before diagnosis was 8. 1 ± 1. 1 (range:
2 months to 37 yr.) years. The most commonmanifestations
were facial changes, enlargement of hands and feet, excessive
sweating, menstrual irregularities, goiter, snoring, and head￾ache. Thirteen of 65 patients (20%) had not noticed any symp￾toms until doctors pointed out signs of acromegaly when the
patients visited hospitals for other reasons. Nineteen of 65 pa￾tients (29%) were diagnosed with diabetes mellitus 6.4 ± 1.5
(mean ± SEM, range: 5 months to 25 yr.) years before they
were diagnosed with acromegaly. Nine of 65 patients (14%)
had been diagnosed with hypertension 6.2 ± 1.2 (mean ± SEM,
range: 1 to 10 yr.) years before they were diagnosed with ac￾romeg aly.
Tumorsize
The majority of the tumors (46 of 65, 71%) were macroade￾nomas (tumor diameter, >1 cm), but 16 (25%) were microade￾nomas (tumor diameter, <1 cm). Three of the 65 patients had
empty sella, and two of these patients underwent transsphe￾noidal surgery before they visited our hospital. Of the 46 pa￾tients who had macroadenomas, 6 had sphenoidal extension, 8
had suprasellar extension, and 16 had invasion of the cavern￾ous sinus. Four patients whounderwent transsphenoidal sur￾gery before they visited our hospital, but still had residual tu￾mor (tumor diameter, <1 cm), were included in the macroade￾noma group.

Closed circles: macroadenomaand empty sella, open circles: microadenoma.
34 female patients (65%) had macroadenomas. There were no
significant gender-based differences in tumor size.
Hormonal evaluation
In all patients, basal serum GHlevels ranged from 3.2 to
340 (mean: 46.4 ± 7.8 ng/ml). Serum GHlevels remained above
1 ng/ml in all patients who underwent 75 g OGTT(n=48). Basal
serum GHlevels were significantly higher in the patients with
macroadenomas (59.7 ± 10.3 ng/ml, range, 3.4 to 340) com￾pared to the patients with microadenomas (14.3 ± 2.9 ng/ml,
range, 3.2 to 44.1, p<0.02). Serum IGF-I levels ranged from
2.2 to 16.7 U/ml (mean: 5.6 ± 0.6 U/ml) in the early series
(n=28), and from 266 to 1,271 ng/ml (mean: 806 ± 39 ng/ml)
in patients who were diagnosed with acromegaly after 1994
(n=36) (Fig. 2). The serum IGF-I levels were not correlated
with serum GHlevels. The serum IGF-I level was not elevated
in one of 65 patients (a 53-year-old woman). She had a
microadenoma and her serum GHand IGF-I levels were 8.1
and 266 ng/ml, respectively, and her serum GHlevel after 75 g
OGTTwas 3.5 ng/ml. The patient had no concomitant disease.
Serum GHlevels increased after thyrotropin releasing hor￾mone (TRH) and luteinizing hormone releasing hormone
(LHRH) administration in 48 of62 (77%) and in 8 of54 (15%)
patients, respectively. Serum GHlevels were reduced by more
than 50%from basal levels after administration of bromocrip￾tine (2.5 mg) in 38 of 52 (73%) patients. Paradoxical responses
to both TRHand bromocriptine were observed in 33 of 51
(65%) patients, while no response to either agent was observed
in 7 of51 (14%) patients.
Treatments and outcome
Figure 3 shows treatment and outcome for all patients. Thir￾teen of 16 patients with microadenomaunderwent transsphe￾noidal surgery. Seven and three were biochemically cured or
in remission, respectively. Three of the 16 patients received
bromocriptine, because their serum GHand IGF-I levels were
not markedly elevated, and the patients chose medical therapy
by themselves. Twowere in remission.
Three patients with empty sella, including two patients who
underwent surgery before they visited our hospital, were treated
with bromocriptine, with or without conventional radiation/
gamma-knife. However, all three patients were poorly con￾trolled.
Thirty of the 46 patients with macroadenomasunderwent
transsphenoidal surgery. Eighteen of 30 patients were treated
with surgery alone. Seven (39%) and 4 (22%) of the 18 pa￾tients were biochemically cured or in remission, respectively.
Four patients were in partial remission. Medical therapy with
bromocriptine was added after surgery in 8 patients. One of
the 8 patients who received bromocriptine between the initial
and repeated surgery was biochemically cured.
Eight of 46 patients with macroadenomawere initially
treated with bromocriptine. Thereafter, 4 of the 8 patients
stopped taking bromocriptine and underwent surgery, and one
was in remission postoperatively. Four patients were initially
treated with octreotide, and three underwent surgery. Twoof
these three patients were biochemically cured following sur￾gery. Eleven of 46 patients required more than three types of
treatment, including surgery, conventional radiation therapy or

patients treated with combinedmodalities went into remission,
whereas the remaining 8 patients were poorly controlled.
The rate of biochemical cure and remission for microade￾noma was 81%(13/16). The rate for macroadenomawithout
extrasellar extension was 64% (9/14). However, for macroade￾noma with cavernous sinus extension, it was only 13% (2/15)
(Table 1).
Five of 65 patients required hormone replacement, includ￾ing adrenal steroids and/or thyroid hormone. Hormonesubsti￾tution for hypopituitarism was necessary for two patients im￾mediately after the first surgery, and for one patient after his
second operation. Twopatients required replacement therapy
within five months after receiving postoperative irradiation (one
was treated with conventional irradiation, and the other with
the gammaknife). Furthermore, there was one patient who re￾quired temporary hormone replacement therapy after surgery.
Complications of acromegaly
Of the 65 patients with acromegaly, two had aortic valve
regurgitation, one had sick sinus syndrome, and two had cere￾bral bleeding. Twenty-six of 65 patients underwent screening
examinationsof the colon with a bariumenemaor colonoscopy
due to the knownincreased prevalence of colonic polyps in
patients with acromegaly (4). These screening examinations
demonstrated colonic polyps in 10 patients and colon cancer

Glucose metabolism was analyzed in all patients before
therapy based on blood glucose levels at all times or during a
75 g OGTT. Fifteen patients (23%) had normal glucose toler￾ance, 18 (28%) had impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and 32
(49%) had diabetes mellitus (DM). Two patients were diag￾nosed with acromegaly when they visited an emergency room
because of diabetic ketoacidosis. After treatment for acro￾megaly, glucose tolerance was analyzed again in 38 of 65
patients. Animprovementin glucose tolerance was observed
in 26 of 29 patients with IGT or DM(Table 2).
Twenty-five of 65 patients with acromegaly (38%) had hy￾pertension. After treatment for acromegaly, only one patient
required a lower dose of antihypertensive drugs as hyperten￾sion improved.
Nine of 65 patients ( 14%) had hyperchoresterolemia. Three,
one and 4 of these patients had diabetes mellitus, hyperten￾sion, or both, respectively. A decrease in the serum cholesterol
level was confirmed in 4 of these patients after surgery. Thir￾teen of 65 patients (20%) had hypertriglyceridemia. All 13
patients had an abnormal glucose metabolism (IGT or DM),
and 4 of them were hypertensive. A decrease in serum triglyc￾eride levels was confirmed in 5 patients after surgery.
Discussion
Weanalyzed the clinical characteristics of 65 patients with
acromegaly who were admitted to Tokyo Women'sMedical
University Hospital between 1990 and 1999. The diagnosis of
acromegaly tends to be delayed because of its insidious nature
(4), and, in our cases, a retrospective analysis revealed that
signs of acromegaly appeared approximately 8 years before
diagnosis. However, considering that 19 of the patients had
been going to hospitals for the treatment of diabetes mellitus,
but were unawareof acral changes, it is clear that physicians
need to identify early symptomsand signs of acromegaly and

Fukuda et al
measure serum GHand IGF-I levels in possible cases of ac￾romeg aly.
Serum GHlevels were significantly higher in macroadenoma
than in microadenoma. However, there were several patients
with microadenomas who had serum IGF-I levels of more than
1,000 ng/ml, which suggests that the response of serum IGF-I
concentration to excessive GHmight be variable. Serum IGF￾I levels before treatment were elevated in all patients except
one. This patient had no concomitant disease, and it is not clear
why she had a normal serum IGF-I level.
Serum GHconcentration did not fall below 1 ng/ml in all
patients in whomOGTTwas performed, but a paradoxical rise
in serum GHfor TRHand LHRHwas not always observed.
This suggests that TRHand LHRHstimulation tests offer no
advantage over OGTTand should not be routinely used for the
diagnosis of acromegaly, as recently recommended by Giustina
et al (8).
Eighty-three percent of the patients with microadenomas
(10/12) and 61% of the patients with macroadenomas (ll/18)
were either biochemically cured or in remission after trans￾sphenoidal surgery only. However, only 13% of patients with
cavernous sinus invasion were biochemically cured or in re￾mission, even after treatment with a combination of surgical,
radiological, and medical therapy. Abosch et al (9) reported
that 76% of patients with acromegaly were in remission post￾operatively. In Japan, it was reported that 30.6 and 59.4 % of
patients were cured or improved after surgery alone, respec￾tively (2). However, it is difficult to compare their data with
ours as the definition of remission and the classification of
outcome are different.
In our series, the definition of "remission" was based on the
normalization of serum IGF-I levels, which might be reduced
despite elevated GHlevels in diabetes mellitus or chronic liver
disease ( 10). However, treatment for acromegaly may contrib￾ute to the normalization of serum IGF-I levels, as those levels
in the patients whowent into remission were elevated before
therapy.
In this study, 54% (14 of 26) of the patients had colonic
polyps or cancer. The incidence of colonic malignancy and
polyps in our patients was higher than in a previous report
(ll), and it is recommended that patients with active acro￾megaly be screened regularly for colon disease.
In our study, only 23%of patients had a normal glucose
tolerance test. The prevalence was similar to that previously
reported (2). Transsphenoidal surgery resulted in the restora￾tion of glucose tolerance even in patients without complete
remission of acromegaly.
The prevalence of hypertension was 38%in our series. This
is nearly the same as a previous report in Japan (2), but some￾what less than that reported by Ezzat et al (1). In their series,
about half of the acromegalic patients were overweight, which
might be the reason for the higher incidence of hypertension.
In the present study, there was improvement of hypertension
in only one patient with acromegaly after surgery, suggesting
that atherosclerotic change caused by long-term hypertension
might remain.
Abnormal lipid metabolism, which was reported in 5-10%
of patients in previous series (3, 1 1), was relatively common in
our series. Hyperlipidemia was associated with abnormal glu￾cose metabolismrather than hypertension.
Patients with acromegaly have a risk of premature motality.
Asreversal of the adverse metabolic effects of excessive GH
concentrations reduces the risk of premature mortality, therapy
to normalize serum GHlevels should be required even in pa￾tients whosesubjective symptomsare not prominent. More￾over, complications of acromegaly, including diabetes melli￾tus, hypertension, and colonic disease, require long-term care￾ful management by physicians.
