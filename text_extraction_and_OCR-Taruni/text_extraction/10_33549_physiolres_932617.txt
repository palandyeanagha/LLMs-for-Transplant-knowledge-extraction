Summary 
Ventricular assist devices (VAD) have recently established 
themselves as an irreplaceable therapeutic modality of terminal 
heart failure. Because of the worldwide shortage of donors, 
ventricular assist devices play a key role in modern heart failure 
therapy. Some clinical data have revealed the possibility of 
cardiac recovery during VAD application. On the other hand, both 
clinical and experimental studies indicate the risk of the cardiac 
atrophy development, especially after prolonged mechanical 
unloading. Little is known about the specific mechanisms 
governing the unloading-induced cardiac atrophy and about the 
exact ultrastructural changes in cardiomyocytes, and even less is 
known about the ways in which possible therapeutical 
interventions may affect heart atrophy. One aim of this review 
was to present important aspects of the development of VAD￾related cardiac atrophy in humans and we also review the most 
significant observations linking clinical data and those derived 
from studies using experimental models. The focus of this article 
was to review current methods applied to alleviate cardiac 
atrophy which follows mechanical unloading of the heart. Out of 
many pharmacological agents studied, only the selective beta2 
agonist clenbuterol has been proved to have a significantly 
beneficial effect on unloading-induced atrophy. Mechanical 
means of atrophy alleviation also seem to be effective and 
promising.

Introduction 
Heart failure represents a complex disorder 
influencing cardiac structure, function, biochemistry, and 
gene expression (Mann and Bristol 2005). Heart muscle 
cells are, due to cardiac plasticity, very sensitive to any 
changes in load or systemic neurohormonal activation. 
The process of cardiac remodeling can be either 
physiological (growth of an organism, physical exercise 
etc.) or pathological, where various noxious stimuli can 
start the vicious cycle of progressive myocardial 
dysfunction terminating in heart failure (Cohn et al. 
2000). Due to the increasing prevalence of chronic heart 
failure, it was essential to develop new therapeutic 
measures in addition to heart transplantation. 
The first introduction of a ventricular assist 
device (VAD) in the 1960s by DeBakey represented 
https://doi.org/10.33549/physiolres.932617

148 Pokorný et al. Vol. 63
a turning point in terminal heart failure therapy. In the 
1990s, VADs became a well-established treatment as 
a bridge to transplantation – treatment of patients with 
end-stage heart failure awaiting heart transplantation. 
Long-term mechanical support also started to be used as 
a destination therapy – therapeutic measure per se in 
patients ineligible for heart transplantation (DeBakey 
2000). Meanwhile the improvement in cardiac function in 
patients on VADs was recognized (Frazier et al. 1996). 
Newer clinical data proved that VAD therapy was able to 
provide myocardial recovery, thanks to a process 
described as the reverse remodeling (Birks et al. 2011). 
Reaching persistent myocardial recovery after VAD 
weaning in patients with advanced heart failure is one of 
the most sought-after targets in recent heart disease 
treatment (Drakos et al. 2011a). Despite intense scientific 
research, there are still many obstacles that prevent us 
from achieving the desired sustained recovery (Butler et 
al. 2012). The development of cardiac atrophy after 
mechanical unloading plays a significant role impacting 
sustained recovery. 
Heart atrophy and ventricular assist devices 
Initially the heart atrophy-acquired reduction in 
the size and mass was described morphologically and 
main diagnostic criteria were based on decreased weight, 
increased pigmentation, subepicardial fat atrophy, 
tortuosity of coronary arteries and increase of 
nuclei/muscle fiber ratio (Hellerstein and Santiago￾Stevenson 1950). 
Cardiac atrophy develops after hemodynamic or 
metabolic unloading of the heart. Cardiac atrophic 
remodeling is a rapid response to many different stimuli 
such as VAD therapy, prolonged bed rest, starvation, 
cancer cachexia, chronic infection, or even spaceflight 
(Hellerstein and Santiago-Stevenson 1950, Perhonen et 
al. 2001). Cardiac plasticity is a process based on rapid 
protein synthesis or degradation control, which allows 
quick adaptation to ongoing stimuli. Depending on the 
type of stimulus, atrophic or hypertrophic changes may 
prevail. In other words, atrophy is defined as a shift in the 
balance of protein turnover in favor of proteolysis. 
According to the stimulus intensity and duration, 
reversible or irreversible changes may develop (Baskin 
and Taegtmeyer 2011). Despite the great clinical 
importance of atrophic remodeling, very little is currently 
known about mechanisms governing the atrophic process. 
Sporadic observations point out the ubiquitin proteosome 
proteolytic pathway as possible executive mechanism in 
cardiac atrophy connected with mechanical unloading of 
the heart. Ubiquitin proteosome proteolytic pathway is 
responsible for the major part of protein degradation and 
it was found to be upregulated early after the heart 
unloading (Razeghi et al. 2003). In accordance with 
previous finding there was also observed activation of the 
calpain system (group of endopeptidases that disintegrate 
myofibrilar proteins and present them to the ubiquitin 
proteasome system) which may regulate cell signaling to 
favor the atrophy (Razeghi et al. 2007). Later studies 
revealed the muscle ring finger 1 as another important 
regulatory protein which is up regulated after ventricular 
unloading and in turn responsible for cardiac atrophy 
development (Willis et al. 2009). Novel observation 
found a significant activation of the FoxO3 transcription 
factor, an established regulator of catabolic processes in 
other cell types. FoxO3 activation by mechanical 
unloading governs both the autophagy-lysosomal and 
ubiquitin-proteasome system to inflict cardiac atrophy 
(Cao et al. 2013). 
Heart atrophy associated with VADs in 
humans 
When mechanical cardiac support is used during 
the treatment of terminal heart failure, beneficial changes 
in the myocardium predominate (reverse remodeling). 
Numerous clinical trials have consistently attested to 
improvement in pathological cardiac hypertrophy, 
calcium homeostasis, enhancement of beta-adrenergic 
signaling, and electrophysiologic remodeling. At this 
point, another puzzling question which emerges is how 
contractile performance can be improved to match the 
reduction of ventricular mass and cardiomyocyte size 
(DeBakey 2000, Heerdt et al. 2000, Terracciano et al. 
2003, Rodrigue-Way et al. 2005, Drakos et al. 2007, 
2011b)? 
According to the latest findings, VAD￾associated cardiac functional recovery is closely linked to 
alterations in several key areas including cell survival, 
energy metabolism, adrenergic receptor signaling, and 
especially calcium handling (Terracciano et al. 2004, 
Klotz et al. 2008, Soppa et al. 2008, Ogletree et al. 2010, 
Felkin et al. 2011, Ibrahim et al. 2012, Mann et al. 2012). 
Nevertheless, some changes that occur after 
mechanical unloading are maladaptive in nature, as it has 
been demonstrated in a limited number of clinical studies. 
Disuse atrophy of a previously hypertrophied ventricle is 

2014 Cardiac Atrophy Alleviation During VAD Therapy 149 
 
potentially an important limiting factor in attempts to 
achieve myocardial recovery in treatment strategies using 
VADs (Maybaum et al. 2007). 
Unloading studies in experimental models 
As the need grows for a deeper understanding of 
the mechanisms that govern reverse remodeling, 
experimental models come into play due to the 
limitations of clinical trials. Heterotopic transplantation 
of the mammalian heart represents a well-established 
model of mechanical heart unloading. First introduced 
in 1933 in dogs (Mann et al. 1933), heterotopic 
transplantation (Fig. 1) was later performed in rats (Abott 
et al. 1964) and thereafter in mice (Corry et al. 1973). In 
particular, thanks to later modifications of the surgical 
technique and especially to the information gained from 
transplantations of failing hearts, the differences in 
changes following normal versus failed heart unloading 
were uncovered (Ruzza et al. 2010, Ibrahim et al. 2013). 
Fig. 1. Schema of heterotopic heart transplantation. 
Although extensive research has been done, we 
are still unable to define the most important pathways 
leading to unloading-induced cardiac atrophy. 
Autophagy, apoptosis and various ways of protein 
degradation have been intensively studied in search for 
possible targets of future therapy (Razeghi et al. 2003, 
2007, Schena et al. 2004, Willis et al. 2009, Muranaka et 
al. 2010, Cao et al. 2013). 
Even though cardiac atrophy associated with 
mechanical unloading has been demonstrated in several 
clinical trials (Maybaum et al. 2007) and in many 
experimental works, not only those using the 
heterotopically transplanted rat heart (Klein et al. 1991, 
Rakusan et al. 1997, Oriyanhan et al. 2007) but also in 
different experimental models based on VADs 
implantation (Kinoshita et al. 1988, 1996), the question 
of unloading-induced cardiac atrophy remains 
controversial. Somewhat unexpectedly some clinical 
trials indicated that, despite a wide array of changes in 
a human failing heart treated with a VAD (increased 
microvasculature density, increased fibrosis), no evidence 
of cardiomyocyte atrophy was found. This conclusion 
was based on the measurement of cell size, glycogen 
content (Drakos et al. 2010) and later on the 
echocardiographic examinations (Drakos et al. 2013). 
Pharmacological means of cardiac atrophy 
alleviation 
Despite the increasing use of mechanical cardiac 
support in the clinical routine, only a handful of patients 
reach permanent cardiac recovery. Mechanical unloading 
is considered to be the main aspect of VAD therapy, 
however myocardial atrophy often develops, especially as 
a result of long-term VAD support. Several clinical 
protocols that maximize the efficacy of VADs as a bridge 
to recovery have been adopted. They combine the VAD 
support and pharmacotherapy aimed to enhance reverse 
remodeling and suppress untoward changes such as 
atrophy or development of fibrosis. From the perspective 
of possible impact on atrophic remodeling, the use of 
adrenergic beta2 agonists, especially clenbuterol, seems 
to be very promising. 
 
The value of clenbuterol in suppressing 
myocardial atrophy during mechanical 
unloading 
Clenbuterol (-1(4-Amino-3,5-dichlorophenyl)-2-
(tert-butylamino)ethanol – Fig. 2), a beta2-adrenergic 
receptor agonist, was first introduced into medical practice 
for treatment of asthma (Xydas et al. 2006). In 1992, the 
anabolic effect of this substance on the skeletal muscle was 
discovered (Choo et al. 1992). Subsequent studies showed 
that clenbuterol led to hypertrophy of not only the skeletal 
muscles but also of the cardiac muscle in rats (Petrou et al. 
1995). When the physiological muscle hypertrophy 
resulting from clenbuterol administration was established, 
this selective beta-2 agonist came into focus as a possible 
treatment of cardiac atrophy (Wong et al. 1998). In 
addition to the hypertrophy inducing properties, 

150 Pokorný et al. Vol. 63
clenbuterol is known to affect cardiac function, gene and 
protein expression, excitation-contraction coupling, and 
cellular metabolism. The favorable effect in cardiac 
atrophy, (the main factor that limits recovery) formed the 
rationale for its use in patients with VAD support to 
improve the recovery rate (Yacoub 2001). 
Fig. 2. Clenbuterol. 
The beneficial effect of clenbuterol was 
subsequently supported by the spectacular results 
achieved by the Harefield group. The combined 
pharmacotherapy (clenbuterol, angiotensin-converting 
enzyme inhibitors, beta1-selective antagonists, and 
spironolactone) which they used during VAD treatment 
of patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy allowed the 
mechanical support explantation in 10 out of 15 patients 
(Hon et al. 2003, Birks et al. 2006). More recent 
prospective trials have also produced results favoring the 
use of clenbuterol. Authors started to administer 
clenbuterol during the second stage of pharmacological 
therapy. The initial dose was 40 µg twice daily and it was 
increased to 700 µg three times daily. When the Harefield 
protocol was followed, weaning from continuous-flow 
mechanical cardiac support was possible in 63.2 % of the 
patients (Birks et al. 2011). In contrast, patients receiving 
an equivalent combined therapy but without clenbuterol, 
reached recovery in 18 % of the cases only. 
Unsatisfactory results are generally achieved in cases of 
ischemic cardiomyopathy, where the rate of recovery is 
only 1 % (Dandel et al. 2011). 
Notwithstanding the value of the above￾mentioned observations, the precise role of clenbuterol in 
the recovery process remains unclear. Heterotopic 
abdominal heart transplantation in rats represents an ideal 
option for a detailed study of how clenbuterol acts in 
unloaded myocardium. The most significant changes 
associated with clenbuterol treatment are listed in the 
following section. 
Effects on cardiomyocyte size, contractility and whole 
ventricular function in experimental models 
Clenbuterol limits unloading-induced reduction 
of cardiomyocyte size in heterotopically transplanted 
hearts where heart failure had been previously induced by 
left coronary artery ligation. Clenbuterol administration 
significantly slowed the decline of cell size, which was 
registered after mechanical heart unloading (Soppa et al. 
2008). No similar effect was found after combining the 
mechanical unloading with clenbuterol treatment in 
a normal heart (Tsuneyoshi et al. 2005). This result 
suggests different regulatory pathways in normal heart 
and ischemic cardiomyopathy, which may help define 
possible targets of clenbuterol treatment. Further studies 
are required to elucidate if clenbuterol administration is 
beneficial when used during periods longer than in the 
studies mentioned above (1 and 2 weeks). Research into 
the effect of clenbuterol itself (without mechanical 
unloading) on the myocardial failure which follows left 
anterior descending coronary artery ligation confirmed 
the drug`s anabolic potential as reflected by a significant 
increase of the heart weight (Xydas et al. 2006). 
Ischemic cardiomyopathy induces impairment of 
cardiomyocyte contractility which remains unaffected by 
mechanical unloading alone. Clenbuterol treatment, in 
itself or combined with mechanical unloading, 
significantly improved cell contractility (Soppa et al. 
2008). 
Clenbuterol-associated functional recovery 
enhancement during mechanical unloading was 
demonstrated either in the echocardiographic data or in 
ex vivo pressure-volume relationship studies (Soppa et al. 
2008). In contrast, no significant difference in papillary 
muscle function was found in a healthy, mechanically 
unloaded heart after clenbuterol administration 
(Tsuneyoshi et al. 2005). There was also no favorable 
effect of clenbuterol alone on the functional recovery of 
the heart as reflected by echocardiographic data (Xydas et 
al. 2006). 
Effects on myocardial apoptosis in experimental models 
Increased myocardial apoptosis during 
mechanical unloading has been reported (Schena et al. 
2004, Tsuneyoshi et al. 2005). In mechanically unloaded 
healthy hearts, there were no significant changes in 
apoptosis markers connected with clenbuterol 
administration. Nevertheless, the expression of caspase-3 
in the unloaded heart tended to decrease in the 
clenbuterol group (Tsuneyoshi et al. 2005). Other 

2014 Cardiac Atrophy Alleviation During VAD Therapy 151 
 
experimental studies proved, in a rat ischemic heart 
model, that beta2-adrenergic stimulation protects 
myocytes from apoptosis (Ahmet et al. 2004). It is also 
believed that, in contrast to the antiapoptotic effect of 
beta2 agonists, beta1-adrenergic receptor (beta1-AR) 
stimulation is proapoptotic. This evidence was derived 
from a study in which clenbuterol and metoprolol 
(beta1-antagonist) treatment, both alone and in 
combination, led to decreased apoptosis levels in the 
ischemic heart failure rat model. Remarkably, effects of 
the combined treatment with clenbuterol and metoprolol 
were additive (Xydas et al. 2006). Nevertheless, the 
usefulness of clenbuterol administration remains 
controversial. Necrosis and a dose-dependent, 
clenbuterol-induced myocardial apoptosis mediated by 
beta1-AR have been reported (Burniston et al. 2005). 
Other beneficial effects 
Combination of clenbuterol and mechanical 
unloading normalized the deranged cardiomyocyte 
calcium cycling. Clenbuterol alone normalized the 
depressed myofilament sensitivity to calcium in ischemic 
cardiomyopathy. Consistent data have come also from 
studies of the mechanical unloading of the normal heart, 
where impaired expression of calcium ATPase 
2a(SERCA2a) in myocardial sarcoplasmic reticulum was 
found to be improved in the clenbuterol-treated animals 
(Tsuneyoshi et al. 2005). The importance of efficient 
calcium cycling for cardiac contractile function is widely 
known, and many trials report its impairment in the 
failing heart. Changes in the excitation-contraction 
coupling and especially in the handling of sarcoplasmic 
reticulum calcium play a key role in clinical recovery 
after VAD therapy in humans (Terracciano et al. 2004, 
Ogletree et al. 2010). Moreover, clenbuterol and 
mechanical unloading normalized the prolonged action 
potential duration in the rat model of heart failure (Soppa 
et al. 2008). 
Notwithstanding many uncertainties and 
reservations concerning the mechanism of action and 
therapeutic value of clenbuterol, no other of the drugs 
studied has so far been found to possess a comparable 
anti-atrophic potential. 
Mechanical principles influencing cardiac 
atrophy
Cardiac atrophy is a complex and highly 
regulated phenomenon involving many signaling 
pathways, and consists of a shift in the balance of 
simultaneous protein synthesis and degradation in favor 
of the catabolic processes. Because of cardiac plasticity, 
disuse atrophy can develop whenever the cardiac load 
declines for a critical period of time (Mann et al. 2012). 
The easiest way of restoring the balance and 
revert the atrophy should be the reloading of the 
myocardium. Unfortunately, this is usually difficult in 
clinical practice because patients could be dependent on 
cardiac output established by VADs, so that none of the 
organ systems will suffer from hypoperfusion. This is the 
main reason why the patient`s left, right, or both 
ventricles are usually highly mechanically unloaded. An 
analogous approach to cardiac reloading was, to a limited 
extent, used by the Berlin group in their bridge to 
recovery protocol (Dandel et al. 2011). All patients on 
VADs were treated with beta blockers (metoprolol, 
carvedilol), ACE-inhibitors (enalapril, ramipril, or 
lisinopril), aldosterone antagonists (spironolactone), loop 
diuretics (furosemide) and digitalis. After the detection of 
cardiac improvement, the doses of ACE-inhibitors and 
diuretics were reduced to increase diastolic pressure and 
thus increase the afterload. As has been previously 
mentioned, the recovery rate in their group of patients 
was 18 % (Dandel et al. 2011). 
Mechanical principles influencing cardiac 
atrophy in experimental models 
Basic research to examine changes following 
unloading and reloading has been performed on various 
experimental models. 
Experimental studies confirmed that the heart 
size and growth are determined, in large part, by the 
volume loading of the heart. Investigators used 
a well-established rat abdominal heterotopic heart 
transplantation model in which, as previously described, 
disuse atrophy peaks at 14 days (Klein et al. 1990). They 
increased the left ventricular load in the transplant by 
inserting a cannula into its aortic orifice to induce 
valvular incompetence and stenosis, and they observed 
significant cardiac mass increase (Korecky and Masika 
1991). Subsequent experiments proved that isovolumic 
loading of the left ventricle by means of placing the 
isovolumic latex balloon into the left ventricle prevents 
atrophy of the heterotopically transplanted rat heart. 
Fourteen days after surgery, the authors registered an 
increased left ventricular weight and a higher rate of 
protein synthesis in loaded ventricles in comparison to 

152 Pokorný et al. Vol. 63
the control group of heterotopically transplanted hearts. 
Thus they presented evidence on the importance of 
cardiac work for the regulation of cardiac growth (Klein 
et al. 1991). 
In accordance with previous works on the 
subject, the effect of load on atrophy and contractile 
function in a heart transplant preparation in rats was 
described. The loaded group of heterotopically 
transplanted hearts was produced by a modified surgical 
technique (left atrium was anastomosed to the inferior 
vena cava, which was then ligated proximally to divert 
distal venous flow to the left ventricle of the transplanted 
heart). Loaded hearts evinced a higher left ventricular 
developed tension, higher left ventricular volume, and no 
significant weight loss, in comparison to the unloaded, 
conventionally transplanted hearts seven days after 
transplantation (Galiananes et al. 1995). 
Some investigators tried to elucidate the extent 
to which the cardiac atrophy could be reversed after 
reloading. In a relevant study, a discrete portion of cat 
myocardium was unloaded (a single right ventricular 
papillary muscle); seven days later, the muscle was 
reloaded again by attaching its apex to the free ventricular 
wall. During one week of reloading, all ultrastructural 
attributes of the past atrophy returned to normal (e.g. 
cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area and volume density of 
the mitochondria), and the depressed contractile function 
returned to the normal state after 14 days of reloading. 
This study demonstrated cardiac plasticity in adult 
mammalian myocardium (Thompson et al. 1984). 
Another investigation was aimed at a detailed 
description of heart reloading after a period of 
mechanical unloading, so modified animal model that 
included the removal of the left ventricular assist device 
was introduced. Heterotopically transplanted hearts were 
unloaded for two weeks and then reloaded by discrete 
surgical procedure. The donor´s right pulmonary artery 
was anastomosed to the recipient’s abdominal aorta for 
another two weeks. As a result, the left ventricular 
weights and volumes increased and almost approached 
normal heart values. This model also demonstrated 
cardiac plasticity in healthy myocardium. A similar 
approach can be used for the evaluation of adjunctive 
interventions in order to facilitate successful VAD 
weaning (Mizuno et al. 2005). 
To find a strategy to reverse disuse atrophy, the 
ventricular pacing was examined. The heterotopically 
transplanted rat hearts were continuously paced 
(420 beats/min) and left ventricular weight and protein 
content were significantly elevated only during the first 
week. After two weeks, there were no significant 
difference between the paced and the non-paced groups 
ofheterotopically transplanted hearts (Geenen et al. 
1994). On the basis of the above results, it is assumed 
that cardiac growth is mostly dependent on a cardiac 
load. 
Conclusions 
Little is known about specific mechanisms 
governing the heart unloading-induced cardiac atrophy 
and about the exact ultrastructural changes in 
cardiomyocytes, and even less is known about possible 
therapeutical interventions affecting heart atrophy. 
Mechanical unloading-induced atrophy undoubtedly 
represents one of the main obstacles preventing 
achievement of cardiac recovery. 
In this review, we summarized important aspects 
of the development of cardiac atrophy in humans, and we 
also tried to find the most significant linkages to 
observations made in experimental models. The major 
aim was to compile currently known possible means 
which might counteract cardiac atrophy during 
mechanical unloading. 
Out of many pharmacological agents, only 
clenbuterol, a selective beta2 agonist has been found to 
have a significant beneficial effect on unloading-induced 
atrophy. In an experimental model of ischemic 
cardiomyopathy, clenbuterol also helped maintain 
cardiomyocyte contractility. Many other beneficial 
effects of clenbuterol on mechanically unloaded failing 
myocardium have been reported. In contrast, no 
significant changes in atrophy progression have been 
reported after clenbuterol administration in normal heart 
mechanical unloading scenarios. Currently, clenbuterol is 
the only agent that affects cardiac atrophy, and it has also 
been used with favorable effect in clinical trials. 
Mechanical means of atrophy alleviation seem to 
be very potent and promising. Various experiments 
proved a very strong dependence of cardiac atrophy on 
cardiac load. However, it seems still not feasible to apply 
this approach in the clinical praxis. Nevertheless, the 
relevant experimental studies potentially open a way for 
new technical solutions in VAD development. A number 
of supplemental strategies, such as patient exercise 
programs, could also be helpful. One very important 
aspect of future successful recovery from heart failure is 
an appropriate timing of VAD therapy in order to 

2014 Cardiac Atrophy Alleviation During VAD Therapy 153 
 
diminish irreversible damage of the myocardium. 
Analysis of myocardial tissue samples obtained 
from recovered patients has revealed many differences 
compared with the samples from their non-recovered 
counterparts. This research could establish a base for 
novel strategies such as direct gene or cell therapy.
