Abstract
Introduction The clinical and economic consequences of the emergence of multidrug-resistant Gram￾negative bacteria in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting, combined with the high mortality rate among
patients with nosocomial pneumonia, have stimulated a search for alternative therapeutic options to
treat such infections. The use of adjunctive therapy with aerosolized colistin represents one of these.
There is extensive experience with use of aerosolized colistin by patients with cystic fibrosis, but there
is a lack of data regarding the use of aerosolized colistin in patients without cystic fibrosis.
Methods We conducted the present study to assess the safety and effectiveness of aerosolized
colistin as an adjunct to intravenous antimicrobial therapy for treatment of Gram-negative nosocomial
pneumonia. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients hospitalized in a 450-bed
tertiary care hospital during the period from October 2000 to January 2004, and who received
aerosolized colistin as adjunctive therapy for multidrug-resistant pneumonia.
Results Eight patients received aerosolized colistin. All patients had been admitted to the ICU, with
mean Acute Physiological and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores on the day of ICU admission and on
day 1 of aerosolized colistin administration of 14.6 and 17.1, respectively. Six of the eight patients had
ventilator-associated pneumonia. The responsible pathogens were Acinetobacter baumannii (in seven
out of eight cases) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (in one out of eight cases) strains. Half of the
isolated pathogens were sensitive only to colistin. The daily dose of aerosolized colistin ranged from
1.5 to 6 million IU (divided into three or four doses), and the mean duration of administration was 10.5
days. Seven out of eight patients received concomitant intravenous treatment with colistin or other
antimicrobial agents. The pneumonia was observed to respond to treatment in seven out of eight
patients (four were cured and three improved [they were transferred to another facility]). One patient
deteriorated and died from septic shock and multiple organ failure. Aerosolized colistin was well
tolerated by all patients; no bronchoconstriction or chest tightness was reported.
Conclusion Aerosolized colistin may be a beneficial adjunctive treatment in the management of
nosocomial pneumonia (ventilator associated or not) due to multidrug-resistant Gram-negative
bacteria.

Introduction
Nosocomial pneumonia due to multidrug-resistant Gram-neg￾ative bacteria, such as certain Pseudomonas aeruginosa and
Acinetobacter baumannii strains, is among the most serious
complications that occur in the intensive care unit (ICU) set￾ting. Mortality, morbidity and health care costs are substan￾tially increased by this type of infection [1-3]. Increasing rates
of resistance among Gram-negative bacteria to most classes
of antimicrobial agents have frequently led to clinical failure of
currently employed therapies. Lack of development and intro￾duction into clinical practice of new antibiotics to combat mul￾tiresistant Gram-negative bacteria have stimulated renewed
interest in the use of the older antibiotic colistin.
Outcomes in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia
(VAP) due to multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria are
poor [1]. Intravenous colistin was recently used to treat such
infections. Notably, a recent study [4] compared intravenous
colistin (21 patients) with imipenem (14 patients) in the treat￾ment of VAP due to multidrug-resistant A baumannii. Mortality
rates were similar: 61.9% among patients treated with intrave￾nous colistin and 64.2% among patients treated with imi￾penem. In patients with cystic fibrosis, aerosolized colistin has
successfully been used to treat acute pulmonary exacerba￾tions of infection or initial colonization with P aeruginosa
strains [5,6]. However, there is a lack of data regarding the use
of aerosolized colistin in patients without cystic fibrosis. A few
reports have indicated that aerosolized colistin may be a ben￾eficial additional therapeutic intervention in the management of
nosocomial pneumonia (whether ventilator associated or not)
[7-10]. In addition, a few old reports of the use of aerosolized
polymyxin B yielded controversial results. Feeley and cowork￾ers [11] reported that use of polymyxin B aerosol in seriously
ill patients is associated with increased incidence of pneumo￾nia due to polymyxin-resistant organisms. However, Klastersky
and colleagues [12] found endotracheal administration of pol￾ymyxin B plus aminosidin to be a useful alternative regimen to
endotracheal gentamicin for the prevention of lung infections.
We present data from our recent experience with aerosolized
colistin for the treatment of pneumonia due to multidrug-resist￾ant Gram-negative bacteria in eight ICU patients.
Methods
Design of the study and patient population
Patients who received colistin (Colomycin®, Forest Laborato￾ries, Kent, UK, or Colistin®, Norma, Athens, Greece) for treat￾ment of infections with multidrug-resistant Gram-negative
bacteria from 1 October 2000 to 31 January 2004 at 'Henry
Dunant' Hospital (a 450-bed tertiary care centre in Athens,
Greece) were identified from the pharmacy electronic data￾base. Medical records, specifically nursing records of medica￾tion administration, were retrospectively reviewed for all
patients in order to identify those who received aerosolized
colistin. One milligram of the colistin formulations used is
approximately equal to 12,500 IU (Forest Laboratories, Kent)
or 13,333 IU (Norma, Athens). Administration of aerosolized
colistin for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia due to
Gram-negative bacteria, and review of patients' charts were
approved by the institutional review board of the hospital.
Data collection and entry
Data for several variables, including demographic and clinical
information, as well as the results of laboratory and imaging
tests (chest radiography or computed tomography of the tho￾rax), were collected from the medical records of patients
receiving aerosolized colistin. All available results of renal func￾tion tests (creatinine, urea, creatinine clearance, urinalysis),
liver function tests (serum glutamate-pyruvate transaminase,
serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, alkaline phos￾phatase, γ-glutamyltransferase, bilirubin), creatine phosphoki￾nase and arterial blood gases were recorded during the
course of colistin treatment and at hospital discharge.
Microbiological testing
All causative micro-organisms were identified using routine
microbiological methods. Susceptibility testing was done
using both the disk diffusion method and an automated broth
microdilution method (Vitek II; bioMerieux, Hazelwood, MO,
USA). (The breakpoints were those defined by the National
Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards [13,14].) Sus￾ceptibility to colistin was tested by means of the disk diffusion
method using a 10 µg colistin disk (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK);
isolates were considered sensitive if the inhibition zone was ≥
11 mm. Intermediate sensitivity of isolated Gram-negative
pathogens to antimicrobial agents was considered resistance.
Multidrug-resistant was defined as resistance of the isolate to
five antipseudomonal classes of antimicrobial agents (i.e.
antipseudomonal penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems,
monobactams, quinolones, colistin and aminoglycosides). An
isolate was defined as colistin-only sensitive if it was resistant
to all antipseudomonal agents except colistin.
Definition of pneumonia
Diagnosis of pneumonia required two or more serial chest
radiographs with at least one of the following: new or progres￾sive and persistent infiltrate, consolidation, cavitation, or pleu￾ral effusion. In addition, patients were required to have had
fever >38°C with no other recognized cause or an abnormal
white blood cell count (leucopenia [<4000 white blood cells/
mm3] or leucocytosis [≥ 12,000 white blood cells/mm3]), and
at least two of the following: new onset of purulent sputum,
change in the character of sputum, increased respiratory
secretions, or increased requirement for suctioning; new
onset or worsening of cough, or dyspnoea or tachypnoea;
rales or bronchial breath sounds; or worsening gas exchange.
Pneumonia was considered to be ventilator associated (VAP)
when its onset occurred 48 hours after the initiation of
mechanical ventilation, and was judged not to have been incu￾bating before the initiation of mechanical ventilation [15].

Definition of outcome
The definition of positive outcome (cure or improvement) of
pneumonia was based on clinical (fever defervescence, reso￾lution or partial resolution of presenting symptoms and signs
of pneumonia, decrease in suctioning requirements), radiolog￾ical (decrease or disappearance of presenting findings on
chest x-ray), and laboratory findings (improvement in arterial
blood gases, or normalization of white blood cell count and C￾reactive protein).
Results
From 1 October 2000 through 31 January 2004, 152 patients
received treatment with intravenous colistin for infections with
multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Eight out of 152
patients were identified as having received aerosolized colistin
for the management of Gram-negative nosocomial pneumonia.
Table 1 describes the demographic and clinical features of
these patients, including comorbidities, responsible patho￾gen(s) and susceptibility of the pathogen(s) to commonly
tested antimicrobial agents, as well as the outcome of the
infection and of the patient.
The mean age of the patients was 59.6 years and most of them
were male (six out of eight). All patients had been admitted to
the ICU, with a mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health
Evaluation II scores on the day of ICU admission and on day 1
of aerosolized colistin administration of 14.6 and 17.1, respec￾tively. During the preceding 3 months, three patients had been
hospitalized in the same or another unit. All patients had
received other antimicrobial regimens before aerosolized col￾istin was initiated. In addition, three patients received immuno￾suppressive treatment (steroids) and four received
immunoglobulin therapy during their hospitalization.
The responsible pathogens in the eight cases of nosocomial
pneumonia were Acinetobacter baumannii (seven out of eight)
and P aeruginosa (one out of eight) strains. Only in one case
was a second strain isolated from the same culture specimen,
and it was found to be methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus. Half of the isolated pathogens were sensitive only to
colistin; the rest were multidrug-resistant strains.
All patients received mechanical ventilatory support for a mean
of 19.4 days. Colistin was prepared for nebulization; 1 or 2 mil￾lion IU colistin was diluted in 2 or 4 ml sterile normal saline

0.9%, respectively. In patients undergoing mechanical ventila￾tion aerosolized colistin was delivered by means of the Sie￾mens Servo Ventilator 300 (Siemens-Elma AB, Solna,
Sweden). In spontaneously breathing patients colistin was
administered as follows: 1,000,000 IU were added to 4 ml
normal saline and the solution was nebulized with 8 l/min oxy￾gen flow and inhaled via a face mask. This technique of admin￾istration of aerosolized medication is commonly used
worldwide for the administration of bronchodilators in neb￾ulized form. The daily dose of aerosolized colistin ranged from
1.5 to 6 million IU divided into three or four doses, and the
duration of administration ranged from 3 to 32 days (mean
10.5 days). No strictly uniform dosing strategy for aerosolized
colistin was applied, and differences in regimen reflect the dif￾fering approaches of the individual attending physicians. In
addition, seven out of eight patients received concomitant
intravenous treatment with colistin or other antimicrobial
agents with activity against Gram-negative bacteria, such as β
lactams, quinolones and aminoglycosides. Only one patient
received aerosolized colistin as monotherapy; she had
received intravenous colistin therapy before aerosolized colis￾tin for 7 days and continued to receive the intravenous therapy
after the end of aerosolized therapy (for 32 days).
The pneumonia was observed to respond to treatment in
seven out of eight patients who received supplemental therapy
with aerosolized colistin. Four episodes of pneumonia were
cured and three were improved at the end of treatment. Only
one out of the eight patients who received aerosolized colistin
for the treatment of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pneu￾monia deteriorated and finally died. He was a 50-year-old mul￾tiple trauma patient, who was admitted to the ICU with
fractures located at C4–C5, haemothorax and functional dis￾section of the spinal cord due to a car accident. His past med￾ical history was noteworthy for arterial hypertension, Wolff–
Parkinson–White syndrome, chronic renal insufficiency due to
polycystic kidney disease and ankylosing spondylitis, for which
he was receiving steroid therapy. During his prolonged hospi￾talization in the ICU, the patient developed pneumonia due to
multidrug-resistant A baumannii, requiring intubation. His clin￾ical condition became complicated by sepsis syndrome due to
an infection caused by a colistin-only sensitive P aeruginosa
strain, which was unresponsive to administered antimicrobial
treatment. On day 95 of his hospitalization in the ICU, he died
from septic shock and multiple organ failure.
Follow-up cultures were available for five out of eight patients.
In four of them the responsible pathogen was eradicated, and
in one case the pathogen persisted in repeated specimen cul￾tures; this patient died. Superinfection with Gram-positive
micro-organisms or yeasts was not observed. No Gram-nega￾tive bacterium developed resistance to colistin in subsequent
specimen cultures during or at the end of aerosolized
treatment.
Administration of aerosolized colistin was well tolerated by all
patients. During treatment, all patients were closely monitored
for possible respiratory adverse reactions, but none of them
experienced chest tightness, bronchoconstriction, or apnoea.
Only two patients, who had history of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, received concurrent treatment with
inhaled β2 agonist. Only in the patient who died did renal func￾tion worsen (baseline serum creatinine increased by 1.4 mg/
dl) during aerosolized colistin treatment. This patient, as men￾tioned above, had a history of polycystic kidney disease and
chronic renal failure, and died from septic shock and multiple
organ failure. No deterioration in renal function was observed
in the other seven patients during colistin treatment. One
patient had baseline serum creatinine levels of 5.4 mg/dl, and
at the end of colistin treatment serum creatinine had
decreased to 4.5 mg/dl. That particular patient was already
receiving haemodialysis treatment before the initiation of intra￾venous or aerosolized colistin.
Of 152 patients who received treatment with intravenous col￾istin for infections with multidrug-resistant Gram-negative
bacteria during the period of study, 55 had received less than
72 hours of intravenous colistin and were excluded from all
analyses. Medical records were not available for three
patients; in addition, one patient was in the hospital during
data collection. Thus, 93 patients were further analyzed. Forty￾five of these patients received intravenous colistin for the treat￾ment of nosocomial pneumonia due to Gram-negative bacte￾ria. Survival and clinical cure rates for the infection were better,
although not statistically significantly so, in patients with pneu￾monia who received additional aerosolized colistin than in
patients who received only intravenous colistin treatment (sur￾vival: 7/8 patients [87.5%] versus 34/45 patients [75.6%], P
= 0.41; clinical cure: 7/8 patients [87.5%] versus 30/45
patients [66.7%], P = 0.67).
Discussion
Aerosolized colistin may be an effective adjunctive intervention
for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia due to multidrug￾resistant Gram-negative bacteria in patients without cystic
fibrosis. Colistin and polymyxin E are old antibiotics; colistin
was almost abandoned for many years because of its reported
nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity. This medication was reintro￾duced into clinical practice just a few years ago, and this
resulted mainly from increased resistance rates among Gram￾negative bacteria, especially in the ICU setting, and the
absence of new and effective alternative therapeutic options
[16-18].
The idea of using colistin or polymyxin B (which belongs to the
same group of antibiotics, and has similar antimicrobial spec￾trum, usage indications and toxicities as colistin) in the neb￾ulized form for the management of pneumonia due to Gram￾negative bacteria is not new. In 1963, Pino and coworkers
[19] used aerosolized colistin in patients with pulmonary sup-

purations. A few years later, Marschke and Sarauw [20]
reported two cases of pneumonia due to P aeruginosa strains
in patients with underlying bronchiectasis and chronic bron￾chitis, in which polymyxin B was given by inhalation. Both
patients experienced dyspnoea due to airway obstruction.
Recently, aerosolized colistin was used successfully to treat
and prevent pneumonia caused by P aeruginosa in patients
with human immunodeficiency syndrome and in patients with
nosocomial pneumonia and tracheobronchitis [21-23].
There is extensive experience with administration of aero￾solized colistin to patients with cystic fibrosis, in whom this
type of treatment is used to prevent or treat lung infections
with P aeruginosa strains. Notably, studies found that neb￾ulized colistin reduced the number of relapses of lung infec￾tions and subsequently the decline in lung function among
patients with cystic fibrosis [24-27].
The pharmacokinetic properties and dosing strategies of aer￾osolized colistin are not well defined. Whether the various
forms of colistin used for inhalation therapy (e.g. dry powder
formulation for inhalation, colistin solutions for nebulization) or
the different types of nebulizing systems influence the effec￾tiveness and safety of colistin remains to be determined [28-
31].
Adverse effects of aerosolized colistin or polymyxin B are a
major concern; potential adverse effects include bronchocon￾striction, chest tightness and apnoea due to neuromuscular
blockade. One study conducted in 58 children with cystic
fibrosis who received nebulized colistin for the treatment of
lung infections [32] reported that 20 of them experienced a
decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1 s by greater than
10% from baseline. In addition, another study [33] found that
35 out of 46 adult patients with cystic fibrosis who also
received nebulized colistin for lung infection developed chest
tightness. However, treatment with inhaled β2 agonists before
the initiation of aerosolized colistin was able to prevent the
development of such side effects in the respiratory system.
Another significant concern regarding the use of aerosolized
colistin for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia is dissem￾ination of multidrug-resistant bacteria through nebulizer
devices [34,35]. However, this potential problem could be
eliminated by strict use of appropriate infection control guide￾lines by medical and nursing hospital staff.
Our study is not without limitations. It is a small case series and
is of a retrospective design. In addition, there is no control
group of patients receiving treatment with only intravenous
antimicrobial agents. Furthermore, some of the patients also
received intravenous treatment with other antimicrobial
agents, which might have influenced the outcomes.
Two major risks are arising from the wide use of colistin: the
emergence of Gram-negative bacteria, such as P aeruginosa
and A baumannii, resistant to colistin; and an increase of infec￾tions due to Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens,
such as Proteus and Serratia spp., inherently resistant to col￾istin. Consequently, there is an urgent need to restrict the use
of colistin use in order to minimize these risks.
Conclusion
Inhaled colistin may be beneficial in the treatment of nosoco￾mial pneumonia (ventilator associated or not) due to multidrug￾resistant, Gram-negative bacteria. However, the severity of
these infections in the ICU setting means that treatment just
with aerosolized colistin is unlikely to be sufficient. This is in
contrast to therapeutic strategies employed in patients with
cystic fibrosis, in which initial lung colonization with P aerugi￾nosa strains is commonly treated with aerosolized colistin
alone. Randomized controlled trials studying the possible
additional benefits and risks associated with use of nebulized
colistin, as an adjunct to intravenous antimicrobial treatment, in
patients with pneumonia due to multidrug-resistant Gram-neg￾ative bacteria are urgently needed.

Key messages
• Aerosolized administration of colistin is a promising 
adjunctive therapy for management of patients with 
pneumonia (whether ventilator associated or not) due to 
multiresistant Gram-negative bacteria
• Aerosolized colistin was safe in this group of patients.
• There is an urgent need for randomized controlled trials 
examining the efficacy and safety of aerosolized colistin 
for the management of patients with nosocomial 
pneumonia.
