whether the clinician is willing to ask about sexual 
issues and does so in a sensitive way.7,8
Patients on long-term medications may not be 
aware that their sexual problems have developed 
as a result of their treatment. Conversely some may 
blame their drugs for sexual problems which are due 
to relationship difficulties or other stressors. Some 
doctors consider that asking patients if they had 
noticed any sexual adverse effects from their drugs 
may ‘suggest’ them to the patient, and possibly result 
in non-adherence. Patients attributing their sexual 
problems to their drugs are less likely to continue the 
treatment even when necessary for their health.9
 The 
consultation should include discussion of the patient’s 
sexual issues so these can be considered in treatment 
decisions. 
Treatments for hypertension
Hypertension is associated with sexual dysfunction.10
Antihypertensives may also contribute to the problem 
and lead to low treatment adherence.4
Men
In an international survey, 20% of men using beta 
blockers (beta adrenoreceptor antagonists) for 
hypertension had erectile dysfunction.11 Centrally￾acting alpha agonists (for example clonidine) and 
diuretics have also been implicated in impairing 
sexual function.4
 The aldosterone receptor blocker 
spironolactone also blocks the androgen receptor 
and is associated with erectile dysfunction and 
gynaecomastia.
Women 
Sexual dysfunction is more common in women 
with hypertension (before treatment) compared 
to normotensive women (42% vs 19%).12 Although 
the sexual effects of antihypertensives have been 
poorly studied in women, these drugs may have 
similar adverse effects on the arousal phase as in 
men, leading to failure of swelling and lubrication. 
Decreased sexual desire (41% of women) and 
sexual pleasure (34%) have been reported.13 Alpha 
adrenergic drugs such as clonidine and prazosin 
also reduce desire (in a small, randomised trial)14
and arousal15. The angiotensin II receptor antagonist, 
valsartan, was associated with improved sexual desire 
and fantasies when compared with the beta blocker 
atenolol in women with hypertension.16
Introduction
Several classes of prescription drugs contribute to 
sexual dysfunction in men and women (Table 1).1-3
Patients who develop drug-induced sexual 
dysfunction are more likely to be non-adherent. 
This has been found with antihypertensives4
 and 
antipsychotics5
. The literature has emphasised male 
sexual problems with less data available on female or 
couple problems.
Recreational drugs such as alcohol, narcotics, 
stimulants and hallucinogens also affect sexual 
function. Short-term use of alcohol affects sexual 
desire by decreasing inhibitions, but also diminishes 
performance and delays orgasm and ejaculation. 
Many substance abusers report better sexual function, 
but often their partners report the opposite.6
Sexual function consists of the phases of sexual 
desire, arousal and orgasm. Both men and women 
can experience problems in any of these phases. Low 
desire, lack of swelling and lubrication in women, 
erectile dysfunction, premature, retrograde or absent 
ejaculation, anorgasmia and painful sex not only 
affect the individual, but also impact on their partner. 
Talking to the patient
Whether patients report their sexual problems 
depends on several factors, including whether the 
patient is comfortable disclosing these problems, and 
Summary
Many medical conditions and their treatments 
contribute to sexual dysfunction. 
Commonly implicated drugs include 
antihypertensives, antidepressants, 
antipsychotics and antiandrogens.
Understanding the potential for drug-induced 
sexual problems and their negative impact 
on adherence to treatment will enable the 
clinician to tailor treatments for the patient 
and his or her partner. 
Encouraging a discussion with the patient 
about sexual function and providing 
strategies to manage the problem are critical 
to good clinical care.

Antidepressants
Many antidepressants cause sexual difficulties.17,20
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin 
noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors inhibit desire, cause 
erectile dysfunction and decrease vaginal lubrication. 
They also impair orgasm in 5–71% of patients.18,21,22
This adverse effect is used therapeutically to delay 
premature ejaculation. 
Tricyclic antidepressants inhibit sexual desire and 
orgasm.23,24 The effects of specific drugs vary 
depending on their mechanism of action. For 
example, clomipramine causes orgasmic difficulties in 
Psychoactive drugs
Aside from the medicine, it is important to be 
aware of the effects of psychiatric problems on the 
patient’s relationship and address the psychosocial 
issues.17 Up to 70% of patients with depression have 
sexual dysfunction, which can affect any phase of 
sexual activity.18 Reports indicate that 30–80% of 
women and 45–80% of men with schizophrenia also 
experience sexual problems.19 In these patients, it may 
be difficult to distinguish the effects of the illness on 
sexual function from the effects of the drugs used for 
treatment.

poorly understood, other neurotransmitter pathways 
including histamine blockade, noradrenergic blockade 
and anticholinergic effects may also be affected by 
antipsychotics. 
Before commencing dopamine receptor 
antagonists it is useful to establish a baseline 
prolactin, as subsequent elevation can then be 
attributed to the drug. Non-drug induced causes of 
hyperprolactinaemia such as pituitary tumours should 
be considered in patients on dopamine receptor 
antagonists.33
Antiepileptics
Sexual dysfunction is common in patients on 
antiepileptic drugs.34 Gabapentin and topiramate have 
been associated with orgasmic dysfunction in both 
men and women, and reduced libido in women.35-37
Contraceptives
Oral contraceptives decrease circulating free 
testosterone. It is postulated that this decreases 
desire in women, although there is little evidence to 
support this.38 As with other disorders, the impact 
of social context including the relationship, and fear 
of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases 
are confounding influences in clinical reports of the 
impact of oral contraceptives.
Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate, used as a 
contraceptive in women, can cause weight gain, 
depression, vaginal atrophy and dyspareunia with 
decreased libido in up to 15% of women.39-41 
Treatments for cancer 
The impact of malignancy and its treatment on 
both the individual and his or her partner can have 
a significant negative influence on their sexual 
relationship. Many of the cancer treatments can lead to 
sexual dysfunction. As common examples, long-acting 
gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists used for 
prostate and breast cancer result in hypogonadism, 
with subsequent reduction in sexual desire, erectile 
dysfunction in men42, vaginal atrophy and dyspareunia 
in women as well as orgasmic dysfunction.34
Drugs for lower urinary tract 
symptoms and benign prostatic 
hyperplasia
Men who present with symptomatic benign prostatic 
hyperplasia and lower urinary tract symptoms have 
an increased incidence of sexual dysfunction. Overall, 
72.2% of men with lower urinary tract symptoms had 
erectile dysfunction compared with 37.7% in those 
without lower urinary tract symptoms.43 Although 
surgery and various therapies can improve lower 
up to 90% of patients, while nortriptyline causes more 
erectile dysfunction but has less effect on orgasm.25
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors are also associated 
with sexual dysfunction. Although moclobemide was 
reported to increase sexual desire,24 the doses used in 
that study were considered subtherapeutic.
Other antidepressants such as venlafaxine and 
mirtazapine have variable negative effects on 
all aspects of sexual function. Initial reports on 
agomelatine in both male and female patients with 
major depressive disorder suggested significant 
antidepressant efficacy without significant sexual 
adverse effects. However, more recent reviews of the 
sexual effects are conflicting.26,27
Antipsychotics
Some antipsychotics may affect sexual function 
more than others (see Table 2).19,28 The only Cochrane 
review of antipsychotic-induced sexual dysfunction 
has reported a small number of studies relating to 
men, but none relating to women.29
Men taking antipsychotics report erectile dysfunction, 
decreased orgasmic quality with delayed, inhibited 
or retrograde ejaculation, and diminished interest in 
sex. Women experience decreased desire, difficulty 
achieving orgasm, changes in orgasmic quality and 
anorgasmia. Dyspareunia, secondary to oestrogen 
deficiency, can result in vaginal atrophy and dryness. 
Galactorrhea is experienced in both sexes.28
A recent observational study of schizophrenia 
found that in patients with diminished sexual desire, 
ziprasidone was preferred over olanzapine.30 The 
majority of antipsychotics cause sexual dysfunction 
by dopamine receptor blockade. This causes 
hyperprolactinaemia with subsequent suppression 
of the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis and 
hypogonadism in both sexes. This decreases sexual 
desire and impairs arousal and orgasm. It also causes 
secondary amenorrhoea and loss of ovarian function 
in women and low testosterone in men.31,32 Although

alpha blockers, where postural hypotension can be 
a problem. In women, sildenafil has shown promise 
for reversing the inadequate lubrication and delayed 
orgasm induced by selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors.53
Changing to an alternative drug is recommended 
for men and women taking antihypertensives. Alpha 
blockers, ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers 
are not considered to cause erectile dysfunction,54
while several studies have suggested that angiotensin II 
receptor antagonists may even improve sexual 
function. Beta1
-selective beta blockers such as 
nebivolol may have potential advantages in these 
patients.55
In patients taking antipsychotics, establish the cause 
of the hyperprolactinaemia then consider dose 
reduction or switching to prolactin-sparing drugs. 
Relationship counselling and addressing patient￾specific concerns can be useful.28
In women, oestrogen cream can alleviate local 
symptoms such as atrophic vaginitis and dyspareunia. 
If a woman complains of sexual dysfunction while 
on an injectable progestogen, another form of 
contraceptive can be considered.34
Suggested solutions to gabapentin-induced 
anorgasmia include dose reduction, timing of dose 
away from planned coitus until anorgasmia no longer 
occurs, substitution with a different medication, and 
co-administration of other medications.35,36
Conclusion
Understanding both the impact of a disorder and the 
effects of its treatment on both the patient and their 
partner are critical to providing good clinical care. 
It is important for the clinician to acknowledge and 
encourage discussion regarding sexual function, as 
well as enquire about the impact of drugs on sexual 
function. This will ensure patients and their partners 
understand their sexual difficulties and treatment 
options. 
Conflict of interest: none declared
urinary tract symptoms, some of these treatments 
also cause or exacerbate erectile dysfunction and 
ejaculatory dysfunction.43
Alpha blockers such as doxazosin, tamsulosin, 
terazosin and alfuzosin for benign prostatic 
hyperplasia are reported to be no worse than 
placebo in their effects on sexual function, although 
tamsulosin was associated with approximately 10% 
increase in ejaculatory dysfunction in treated men.44
Other drugs that cause sexual 
dysfunction
Antiandrogens such as cyproterone acetate, 
cimetidine, digoxin and spironolactone block the 
androgen receptor. This reduces sexual desire in both 
sexes,45 and affects arousal and orgasm.
Steroids such as prednisone used for many 
chronic inflammatory disorders result in low serum 
testosterone which reduces sexual desire and causes 
erectile dysfunction.46 Immunosuppressive drugs such 
as sirolimus and everolimus are widely used in kidney 
transplantation and can impair gonadal function and 
cause erectile dysfunction.47 Protease inhibitors for 
HIV have also been implicated in sexual dysfunction 
and cause erectile problems in over half of men taking 
them.48
Many other drugs including antihistamines, 
pseudoephedrine, opioids and recreational drugs may 
cause sexual dysfunction and should be considered 
when assessing the patient. 
Strategies to manage sexual 
dysfunction
Non-drug approaches include therapy with a clinical 
psychologist who understands sexual dysfunction. 
A variety of strategies have been tried to reverse 
drug-induced sexual dysfunction, including drug 
switching, dose reduction and drug holidays. Taking 
a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor in anticipation 
of intercourse has become the standard of care for 
men.49-51 It improves erections in about 70% of men 
with hypertension.52 However, phosphodiesterase 
type 5 inhibitors are contraindicated in men using 
nitrates and should be used with caution in those on
