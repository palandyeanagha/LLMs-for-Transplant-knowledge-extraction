Abstract
Background: Little is known about the social determinants of sleep attainment. This study examines the
relationship of race/ethnicity, socio-economic status (SES) and other factors upon sleep quality.
Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 9,714 randomly selected subjects was used to explore sleep quality obtained
by self-report, in relation to socioeconomic factors including poverty, employment status, and education level. The
primary outcome was poor sleep quality. Data were collected by the Philadelphia Health Management Corporation.
Results: Significant differences were observed in the outcome for race/ethnicity (African-American and Latino
versus White: unadjusted OR = 1.59, 95% CI 1.24-2.05 and OR = 1.65, 95% CI 1.37-1.98, respectively) and income
(below poverty threshold, unadjusted OR = 2.84, 95%CI 2.41-3.35). In multivariable modeling, health indicators
significantly influenced sleep quality most prominently in poor individuals. After adjusting for socioeconomic
factors (education, employment) and health indicators, the association of income and poor sleep quality
diminished, but still persisted in poor Whites while it was no longer significant in poor African-Americans (adjusted
OR = 1.95, 95% CI 1.47-2.58 versus OR = 1.16, 95% CI 0.87-1.54, respectively). Post-college education (adjusted OR =
0.47, 95% CI 0.31-0.71) protected against poor sleep.
Conclusions: A “sleep disparity” exists in the study population: poor sleep quality is strongly associated with
poverty and race. Factors such as employment, education and health status, amongst others, significantly mediated
this effect only in poor subjects, suggesting a differential vulnerability to these factors in poor relative to non-poor
individuals in the context of sleep quality. Consideration of this could help optimize targeted interventions in
certain groups and subsequently reduce the adverse societal effects of poor sleep.
Background
Sleep is receiving increasing and warranted attention as
a health risk factor with a majority of studies showing
an association between sleep and mortality [1-4]. How￾ever, sparse literature is available on the determinants of
sleep in the general population, a topic which can be
referred to as “population sleep.” Cultural context and
socioeconomic determinants, in particular, may play a
major role in shaping population sleep practices [5].
Sleep characteristics in the general population has
been studied, for the most part, by assessing sleep dura￾tion as the outcome [6-14]. Measuring duration is
insightful but sleep attainment, in reality, is subject to
great degrees of subjectivity when individuals are ques￾tioned about whether they receive sufficiently restful
sleep. For instance, 6 hours of sleep may have differen￾tial physiological, cognitive, and psychosocial effects on
different individuals. Furthermore, subjects tend to over￾estimate self-reported sleep duration when compared
against objective measures [15]. We elected to focus on
the concept of sleep quality as it theoretically captures
broader information including sleep duration, physiolo￾gic factors and psychosocial perception of sleep attained.
Although the literature examining health outcomes
associated with sleep has focused on sleep duration
[16-19], there is a growing body of evidence for the role
of sleep quality in health outcomes as well [20-24], since

sleep duration and quality may exert separate though
overlapping effects [25-27].
Lower socioeconomic strata frequently are exposed to
a systematically higher risk for poorer health outcomes,
morbidity and mortality [28] for a variety of reasons
[29]; this has resulted in a socioeconomic health gradi￾ent [29]. Differential sleep attainment has been corre￾lated with SES measures [30-32]. Although a majority of
investigators have not focused primarily on socioeco￾nomic influences upon sleep or the sample has been too
small to meaningfully consider multiple other covariates
[6,7,9,13]. Nonetheless, the existing data suggest the
interesting concept that disparities in sleep could
explain part of the socioeconomic health gradient
[31,33].
We hypothesize that socioeconomic factors (income,
education level, and employment status) play a signifi￾cant role in the quality of sleep reported. We elected to
explore this in a population-based sample in order to
maximize study generalizability. This approach can offer
important insights into the effect of socioeconomic dis￾parities on sleep quality, extend our current understand￾ing of sleep attainment in the broader population and
help lay the foundation for targeted interventions to
improve sleep in different cultural and socio-economic
groups.
Methods
Subjects
The study dataset comes from a community survey by
the Philadelphia Health Management Corporation
(PHMC), a non-profit organization that focuses on com￾munity health. PHMC administers this uncompensated
cross-sectional survey in south east Pennsylvania every
two years, with the most recent survey conducted in
2006 [34]. The survey examines health and social well￾being of residents in Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Mon￾tgomery, and Philadelphia counties. Households are
chosen using a random-digit dial methodology [35]. One
adult aged greater or equal to 18 years is then selected
from each household using the “last birthday” method
[35]. Telephone interviews are conducted in English or
Spanish and all data are based on subjects’ self-reported
responses. Permission from the PHMC was obtained
before analysis of this dataset.
Measurements
Sleep
Subjects were asked to the answer the following ques￾tion regarding their sleep quality: “In general, how
would you rate the quality of your sleep in the past
week on a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being restless and 5
being restful.” This question is similar to question 4 on
the Sleep Heart Health Study Morning survey [36].
Socioeconomic factors
Income status (represented as being above or below the
poverty threshold set by the Census Bureau) was ascer￾tained for each subject based on income [37]. In cases
of missing income data, income status was imputed
using employment status of the main wage earner, Med￾icaid insurance status and educational level. Education
was based on typical educational benchmarks, with the
following response self-reported options: less than high
school graduate, high school graduate, some college, col￾lege graduate, and post-college level education. Employ￾ment status was categorized into employed, unemployed
(included disabled), retired, and other (homemaker/
student).
Covariates
Sociodemographic factors included in the analysis were
age, sex, race/ethnicity, and marital status. Race/ethni￾city was classified into 4 categories: White (not Latino),
African-American (not Latino), Latino, and other
(Asians, Native American, biracial/mixed ("other” race
groups were collapsed into one category due to low
rates of endorsement). Marital status categories were
married, living with a partner, single, widow, and other
(divorce/separated/other).
Health indicators and lifestyle habits considered perti￾nent to sleep included self-reported health status (poor,
fair, good, and excellent), body mass index category
[38]. (BMI ≤ 25, 25-30, >30), smoking status (smoking
versus non-smoking), heavy alcohol use [39,40] (defined
previously by the number of occasions in the preceding
30 days when alcohol consumption exceeded 5 drinks),
diagnosis of mental illness (yes or no), and stress levels
(low, mild, moderate, high, and very high).
Statistical analysis
Two procedures in SAS 9.0 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary,
North Carolina) for analyzing survey data, SURVEY￾FREQ and SURVEYLOGISTIC, were used to perform
statistical analysis. All analyses were conducted employ￾ing sample weights so that inferences could be made
about the target population [41]. As the outcome, sleep
quality, is an ordinal variable with 5 levels, we fit a
cumulative logit model first. The score chi-square was
used for testing the proportional odds assumption.
When the proportional odds assumption was not met,
we fit a generalized logit model. The final model is a
logistic regression model with a dichotomized sleep
quality outcome (poor sleep versus good sleep) to facili￾tate interpretation of such models through odds ratios
(OR). The cut-point for poor sleep was determined
(sleep quality score = 1) from the results of the general￾ized logit model. This model revealed that income sta￾tus, education, or employment (primary exposures) did

not demonstrate variable levels of effect upon sleep
quality scores as sleep quality progressively increased
from 2 to 5. Furthermore, to test the sensitivity of the
selection of cut points we employed a poor sleep thresh￾old of greater than or equal to 3 in the same regression
models and observed that the direction of effect was
similar. We thus elected to use a cut-point of 2 on the
5-point scale to dichotomize sleep quality. This would
allow for calculation of odds ratios (OR) that were read￾ily interpretable without obscuring important effects.
Logistic regression models taking into account the sur￾vey sampling weights were fitted to this dichotomous
outcome. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered sta￾tistically significant.
Results
In 2006, 36,853 potential participants were contacted by
PHMC and 10,100 subjects provided responses to the
survey. This response rate of 28% is fairly typical for
uncompensated telephone surveys [42]. Among the
10,100 respondents, 9,714 (96.2%) answered the sleep
question. No information was collected by the surveying
agency regarding non-responders. Comparison with
Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS)
2005 [43] for age, gender, and race/ethnic composition
revealed that the PHMC sample was similar to expected
population norms. Table 1 provides characteristics of
the PHMC sample. Poor sleep was reported by 9.1% of
the sample (sleep quality = 1 “restless”) and only 30.1%
reported a sleep score equal to 5 ("restful”).
Table 2 summarizes unadjusted odds ratios for poor
sleep quality (sleep quality = 1 in the 5 point scale),
with and without sample weights. Race/ethnic differ￾ences were observed with African-Americans and
Latinos reporting poorer sleep compared to Whites
(OR = 1.65, 95% CI 1.37-1.98 and OR = 1.59, 95% CI
1.24-2.05, respectively). Income status was strongly asso￾ciated with poor sleep quality (OR = 2.84 95% CI 2.41-
3.35). Each increment in level of education was asso￾ciated with an increasing protective effect upon sleep
quality: post college educational attainment predicted an
82% (95% CI 0.13-0.26) reduction in odds for poor sleep
quality compared to subjects with less than high school
education levels. Unemployment and a non-married sta￾tus were significantly associated with poor sleep quality
as were poor health status and elevated stress levels. For
example, poor health conferred an OR = 8.41 (95% CI =
6.23-11.35) comparing with excellent health and very
high stress levels an OR = 4.43 (95% CI = 3.39-5.80)
comparing to low stress. Smoking was associated with
poor sleep quality whereas alcohol ingestion was not.
Table 3 shows unweighted results and Table 4 shows
weighted results from logistic regression with poor
sleep as the dependent variable; the results from the
weighted and unweighted analyses are generally simi￾lar. In both weighted and unweighted analyses, three
models were constructed; all three models were
adjusted for age and sex. Model 1 shows the race￾specific effects of income status on sleep quality. The
data was analyzed in this manner as we observed sig￾nificant interaction (p < 0.0001) between income status
and race for Whites, African-Americans and Latinos;
by subsequently creating categories of race-income sta￾tus, we were able to derive ORs for poor sleep for
each category that facilitate interpretation of study
findings. Model 1 compares sleep quality amongst dif￾ferent race-income status groups to not poor Whites
(referent group): Minority race/ethnic groups demon￾strated increased odds for poor sleep. African-Ameri￾cans and Latinos below the poverty line especially
demonstrated significantly increased likelihood of poor
sleep (OR = 2.72, 95% CI 2.13-3.46 and OR = 2.57,
95% CI 1.88-3.51 respectively). However, impoverished
Whites had the highest likelihood of poor sleep
(OR = 4.20 95% CI 3.30-5.35).
After including education, employment and marital
status (Model 2), we observed an attenuated but persis￾tent “sleep disadvantage” (worse sleep quality score)
amongst impoverished groups especially in Whites
(OR = 2.46, 95% CI 1.87-3.23). Model 3, the final
model, included several health indicators considered to
be relevant to sleep quality. The association between
impoverished Whites and poor sleep remained highly
significant (OR = 1.95, 95% CI 1.47-2.58). However,
African-Americans below the poverty line no longer
demonstrated increased odds for poor sleep when these
additional factors were included, whereas the increased
odds of poor sleep quality in not poor African￾Americans persisted with minimal attenuation (OR =
1.45, 95% CI 1.08-1.94). Additional SES factors that
remained significantly associated with poor sleep quality
in Model 3 included lower levels of education and
unemployment. Having at least a college level education
(compared to less than high school education) was asso￾ciated with approximately a 50% reduction in odds for
poor sleep. Being widowed or living with a partner
(compared to married) was associated with increased
odds of poor sleep. Fair or poor self-rated health (com￾pared to excellent health) was significantly associated
with poor sleep. Very high levels of stress and smoking
were also significant predictors of poor sleep. Though
not significant, a trend in association was observed for
obesity (BMI > 30) and psychiatric diagnosis. Taken
together, of these additional factors included into Model
3, self-reported general health and stress level had the
largest effects on increasing the risk of poor sleep
amongst impoverished individuals. In contrast, for min￾ority subjects above the poverty line, these employment,

education, general health and marital status factors had
modest effect on the increased likelihood of poor sleep.
Discussion
The public health ramifications of sleep are far-reaching
and under-recognized as stated in a recent report by the
Institute of Medicine [44]. Many have reported the ill
effects that poor sleep, defined by suboptimal sleep
duration or the presence of sleep disorders, confers
upon health (including mortality) [1-4,45], well-being,
and society [44]. The collective economic impact of
impaired/restricted sleep is enormous and has been con￾servatively estimated at $107 billion [44]. It is, therefore,
critical to advance our understanding of the determi￾nants of sleep attainment given the impact.
This study included and adjusted for several covariates
that plausibly influence sleep quality that have not been
addressed in prior studies [6,8,11-13], with interesting
results. A significant “sleep disparity” exists in the popu￾lation sample, with African-American and Latino groups
overall having poorer sleep quality than the White, non￾poor, referent group. Amongst these minority subjects,
the impoverished subgroups reported the highest odds
for poor sleep. The inclusion of other socio-economic
and health covariates, however, significantly modified
these findings. Of particular interest, health covariates
markedly attenuated the relationship between poor sleep
and race/ethnicity for impoverished individuals: impo￾verished African-American subjects demonstrated a
diminution of the odds ratio for poor sleep upon includ￾ing socio-economic covariates such as employment and
education (model 2), but the odds ratio became non-sig￾nificant only when health covariates were included
(model 3). This offers insights into potential targets for
intervention by suggesting that minorities are particu￾larly vulnerable to the effects of poor health on sleep
quality.
These results are consistent with literature linking SES
[6,9,12,33,46-49] and race/ethnicity disparities to sleep
attainment [7,9,50]. However, our analysis advances on
these studies by reporting for the first time the interac￾tive effects of race and SES upon sleep quality in a large
population sample. There is a growing appreciation that
race and SES may operate in an interactive manner on
health outcomes [51]. Thus, instead of the issue being
an issue of race or class, it may be race and class [52].
This may be true for sleep attainment and the asso￾ciated health outcomes.
Our observation that impoverished White subjects
demonstrated the highest odds for poor sleep in con￾trast to other race/ethnic groups who did not have
increased likelihood of poor sleep after adjusting for the
same covariates is intriguing when examined in the con￾text of existing literature on health disparities- typically
poor minority groups experience the most health disad￾vantage [53]. We believe this adds new perspective to
the minority poverty hypothesis that refers to the unique
disadvantage experienced by impoverished African￾Americans [51]. The underlying mechanism of poorer
reported sleep quality in this group is unclear and may
represent biological, psychosocial, cultural and environ￾mental processes. It is possible, for example, that
“expectations” of sleep quality led to a greater sense of
impaired sleep quality in Whites. This warrants further
investigating to assist in future public health campaigns
and sleep-health policy.
African-Americans above the poverty line had signifi￾cantly increased odds for poor sleep compared to the
White referent group and African-Americans below the
poverty line in multivariable adjusted analysis. This
raises further questions: 1) What are the explanations
for sleep quality disparity amongst not poor African￾Americans and Whites? This may be related to societal
structure and/or due to a differential SES/sleep relation￾ship in African-Americans and Whites [53] and; 2) Why
do African-Americans above the poverty line have
increased likelihood of poor sleep than African-Ameri￾cans below the poverty line? Sleep disadvantage in the
latter group, as noted earlier, may be explained by edu￾cation, employment and health factors. In African￾Table 1 Demographic characteristics of PHMC Sample (Continued)

Americans above the poverty line, though, their higher
SES has been hypothesized to foster positive social, psy￾chological, and economic skills that shield against the
effect of adversity [54] which in theory would protect
sleep attainment. The persistence of poor sleep in the
fully adjusted Model 3 analysis in non-poor African￾Americans may instead be related to other factors such
as higher sleep/health expectations, career demands, and
social roles [5]. As noted earlier, though, this same find￾ing did not hold true for Whites: Impoverished Whites
demonstrated worse sleep quality than non-impover￾ished Whites even in adjusted analysis. This raises the
intriguing question of whether poverty has differential
effects on symptom perception in different race/ethnic

groups even after adjusting for SES and health factors.
Several explanations in a variety of socio-ecological
domains may be posited for this sleep-race-SES gradient:
differences in health behavior (for example, self-efficacy,
perception, attitudes and value expectancy), psychosocial
circumstances, and environment (social and physical)
can disparately affect sleep. Future research relying on
qualitative methods and grounded in health behavior
theory could add to our understanding of these factors.
Of note, this finding of a statistically significant elevated
OR for impaired sleep in not poor African-Americans
even in multivariate modeling that was observed in the
weighted model was not as prominent in the
unweighted model: for the unweighted model, there

remained an elevated OR (1.25), but the lower limit of
the confidence interval was 0.97, thus it represented a
trend towards statistical significance in the unweighted
model. Thus, the findings were similar in the weighted
and unweighted models.
The literature linking sleep and health continues to
grow. Our study is consistent with this as we observed
that poor health was associated with an almost 4-fold
increased likelihood of poor sleep in the final model
and represented one of the most significant factors
(Model 3). It is important to note that the relationship
between health and sleep quality is likely bidirectional
and/or parallel: sleep can influence health and vice￾versa.

Assessing sleep quality over sleep quantity may have
several advantages. We believe that assessing sleep qual￾ity captures multiple domains of sleep including quan￾tity, consolidation, daytime functioning, and sleep
satisfaction. Sleep quality, compared with sleep quantity,
has superior relation to measures of health, well-being,
and sleepiness [55]. Sleep duration studies typically
define a referent duration as an optimal. This can over￾look sleep sufficiency, disruption and of course known
biological differences in sleep requirements [56]. Finally,
there is a reported discrepancy between subjective and
objective sleep duration [15]. Theoretically, inquiry
about sleep quality may encompass these concerns.
Limitations
Respondents were from Philadelphia metropolitan area
thereby limiting generalizability to similar locales. None￾theless, the respondents were from diverse race/ethnic
backgrounds. Telephone surveys are inherently limited
by coverage (low socioeconomic status, disabled, and
institutionalized subjects may not have access to a tele￾phone) and response rate. A response rate of 28% is
consistent with reported attrition discussed in the litera￾ture [57] and does not necessarily translate to non￾response bias [58]. However, this is still a low response
rate by absolute standards, and may reflect a number of
biases in the sample, systematically excluding those who
cannot be on the phone for longer periods of time and/
or are not willing or able to participate in research and
reflecting biases caused by social desirability and/or
demand characteristics. Importantly, this study’s sample
characteristics are generally similar to Census data for
the same geographical area. In addition, we have pre￾sented both weighted (correcting for differences relative
to Census data) and unweighted data; the results are
fairly similar for both methods.
The cross-sectional design limits inference of causality
in the effect of SES on sleep quality. SES measurement
is challenging and not completely captured by any single
or combination of factors [59]. Nonetheless, all mea￾sured SES dimensions (income status, low education
level, and unemployment) were significantly associated
with poor sleep. Furthermore, we recognize that differ￾ent socioeconomic factors may affect health at different
times in the lifespan [59].
Conclusions
Our study provides insight into the complex relationship
of socioeconomic factors, race and health on population
sleep, a major public health issue [44]. While we
observed highly significant race-socioeconomic differ￾ences in sleep quality in a relatively large population
sample, these effects were different in various race/eth￾nic groups. Minority groups had worse overall sleep
quality than Whites, but when examining poor subjects
in various race/ethnic subgroups, we observed that
impoverished Whites had paradoxically worse sleep than
corresponding impoverished minority groups. Further￾more, this poor sleep quality was significantly mediated
by education, employment and health factors in poor
individuals, but not in individuals above the poverty
line. This highlights the differential impact of SES and
general health factors in poor minority groups.
Future research evaluating for SES disparities in sleep
is an important exercise to: 1) highlight inequality in an
overlooked but important health behavior; 2) to begin to
understand how sleep attainment is influenced and; 3)
to be able to target higher-risk groups for interventions.
The impact of sleep behavior on health outcomes is a
rapidly growing literature as is our understanding of
social inequalities in health. Thus, disparity in sleep
quality as an explanation of socioeconomic inequality in
health is an area that also requires further attention.
