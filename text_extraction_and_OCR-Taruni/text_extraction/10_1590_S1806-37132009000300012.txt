Abstract
Due to the increasing number and improved survival of lung transplant recipients, radiologists should be aware 
of the imaging features of the postoperative complications that can occur in such patients. The early treatment 
of complications is important for the long-term survival of lung transplant recipients. Frequently, HRCT plays 
a central role in the investigation of such complications. Early recognition of the signs of complications allows 
treatment to be initiated earlier, which improves survival. The aim of this pictorial review was to demonstrate the 
CT scan appearance of pulmonary complications such as reperfusion edema, acute rejection, infection, pulmonary 
thromboembolism, chronic rejection, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, post￾transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, bronchial dehiscence and bronchial stenosis.

Resumo
Com o número cada vez maior e uma melhor sobrevida dos pacientes submetidos ao transplante pulmonar, os 
radiologistas devem estar cientes das diversas possibilidades de complicações associadas ao transplante de pulmão. 
O tratamento precoce das complicações é importante para a sobrevida a longo prazo dos receptores de transplante 
pulmonar. Com frequência, a TCAR desempenha um papel central na investigação de tais complicações. O reconhe￾cimento precoce dos sinais de complicações proporciona um tratamento rápido e melhora a sobrevida. O objetivo 
desta revisão pictórica foi proporcionar uma visão sobre as complicações mais prevalentes na TC, tais como edema 
de reperfusão, rejeição aguda, infecção, tromboembolismo pulmonar, rejeição crônica, síndrome da bronquiolite 
obliterante, pneumonia em organização criptogênica, doença linfoproliferativa pós-transplante, deiscência brôn￾quica e estenose brônquica

4 and generally improves by the end of the first 
postoperative week. This condition also referred 
to as the pulmonary reimplantation response. 
The edema can persist for up to 6 months after 
transplantation. However, in most lung trans￾plant recipients, it will have resolved completely 
by postoperative month 2.(6) Although chest 
X-ray is the most common form of radiological 
investigation, CT scans can provide valuable 
additional information (Figure 1). At peak 
severity, reperfusion edema appears, in the upper, 
middle and lower lung zones, as reticular inter￾stitial disease in 19%, 33% and 34% of cases, 
respectively, or as airspace disease in 31%, 61% 
and 57% of cases, respectively.(7) Reperfusion 
edema has been reported to be asymmetric in 
nearly 20% of patients undergoing double lung 
transplantation.(7) The CT features are nonspe￾cific and can include perihilar ground-glass 
opacities, peribronchial/perivascular thickening, 
pleural effusion (Figure 1) and reticular intersti￾tial/airspace opacities located predominantly in 
the middle and lower lung lobes.(7)
Acute rejection
Acute rejection after transplantation is a 
common occurrence. Nearly 95% of patients 
present at least two episodes within the first 
month after surgery. Histologically, acute 
rejection is characterized by predominantly 
lymphocytic perivascular infiltrate, with or 
without bronchiolar involvement.(8) Symptoms 
are generally nonspecific, including low-grade 
cific and at times confusing. The aim of this 
paper was to describe the most common post￾operative complications in adult recipients of 
lung transplants, based on a retrospective evalu￾ation of cases at our institution and a review of 
literature. We have grouped the most prevalent 
complications by type: reperfusion edema; acute 
rejection; infections; pulmonary embolism and 
infarction; cryptogenic organizing pneumonia; 
chronic rejection (due to bronchiolitis obliterans 
syndrome); bronchial anastomosis complications 
(including bronchial dehiscence and stenosis); 
and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder. 
These can also be categorized temporally as 
follows: immediate complications (occurring 
within the first 24 h after transplantation), 
which are related to respiratory mechanics (e.g., 
pneumothorax); early complications (occurring 
within the first 2 postoperative months), which 
include reperfusion edema, acute rejection, 
infection, bronchial dehiscence and pulmo￾nary thromboembolism; and late complications 
(occurring after postoperative month 2), which 
include chronic rejection (bronchiolitis obliterans 
syndrome), cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, 
post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder and 
bronchial stenosis.(5)
Reperfusion edema
Reperfusion edema (ischemia-reperfusion 
injury) is noncardiogenic pulmonary edema that 
typically develops more than 24 h after trans￾plantation, peaks in severity on postoperative day

majority (65%) of transplant recipients develop 
infectious complications, 30% of which are 
extrapulmonary.(5) Most such infections involve 
the transplanted lung.(12) Bacteria and fungi are 
major causes of infection within the first postop￾erative month, whereas viral infections are more 
prevalent in postoperative months 2 and 3.(6)
Severe bacterial pneumonia accounts for 
more than 60% of post-transplant infections 
and is typically caused by Staphylococcus aureus, 
enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa or 
other gram-negative organisms.(12) Although the 
incidence of bacterial pneumonia is highest in 
the first month after transplantation, bacterial 
pneumonia continues to be a potential major 
infectious complication throughout the life 
of the patient.(12,13) The incidence of serious 
bacterial pneumonia in the immediate post￾operative period after lung transplantation has 
been reduced by the routine prophylactic use 
of broad-spectrum antibiotics.(13) In lung trans￾plant recipients, the radiological manifestations 
of bacterial pneumonia, which include lobar 
or diffuse consolidation, cavitations and lung 
nodules, are similar to those seen in other hospi￾talized patients with bacterial pneumonia.(13) In 
this context, CT might be helpful in confirming 
the presence of subtle radiographic abnormali￾ties, thereby directing the clinician to the most 
appropriate lobe at bronchoscopy. For some 
infections, the CT appearance can suggest a 
fever, breathlessness and fatigue. Most patients 
experience at least one episode of acute rejec￾tion within the first 3 weeks and remain at high 
risk for this complication for the first 100 days 
after transplantation.(5) Chest X-ray findings 
are normal in up to 50% of cases.(6) The most 
common findings are perihilar and lower-lobe 
opacities, as well as interlobular septal thick￾ening and pleural effusion (Figure 2).(9) The HRCT 
features are relatively nonspecific and include 
ground-glass opacities (often with basal distri￾bution), peribronchial cuffing, septal thickening 
(interlobular and intralobular) and new or more 
extensive pleural effusion.(10) This complication 
can be almost completely excluded if there are 
no ground-glass opacities.(9) Acute rejection is 
treated with intravenous corticosteroids and 
typically responds quite well after 24 h of this 
treatment. A dramatic reduction in abnormal 
radiological features after 48 h of intravenous 
administration of methylprednisolone is indica￾tive of a diagnosis of acute rejection.(9,10)
Infections
Pulmonary infections, which constitute a 
leading cause of morbidity and mortality, can 
occur at any time after transplantation.(3) The 
direct communication between the transplanted 
lung and the atmosphere facilitates infection. 
This is compounded by impaired mucociliary 
clearance and failure of the cough reflex.(11) The

monia, chest X-ray findings can be normal, 
and abnormal findings, when present, are 
often nonspecific.(11) Cytomegalovirus (CMV) 
is the most common opportunistic infection 
among such patients.(14) The incidence of CMV 
infection peaks between 1 and 2 months after 
transplantation, most cases occurring between 
postoperative months 1 and 12.(11,14) Infection 
with CMV can be primary and secondary. Primary 
infection occurs in over 90% of CMV seron￾egative patients receiving a CMV seropositive 
specific infectious agent.(5) The following are the 
most common CT findings in cases of infection 
after lung transplantation: atelectasis; broncho￾centric opacities; subsegmental, segmental or 
lobar airspace consolidation; branching nodular 
and linear opacities (“tree-in-bud” appearance); 
interlobular septal thickening; and pleural effu￾sion.(13-15)
Opportunistic infection occurs in 34-59% 
of lung transplant recipients.(13) Unfortunately,

plant recipients with active CMV infection, chest 
X-ray findings can be normal,(11) CT scans better 
depicting the radiological manifestations of the 
infection, which almost exclusively affects the 
allograft. The most common CT manifestations 
are ground-glass opacities, tree-in-bud opaci￾ties, airspace consolidation, nodules, interlobular 
septal thickening, pleural effusions, thickened/
enlarged pleura and bronchiectasis.(11-15) Other 
common viral pulmonary pathogens affecting 
this population include herpes simplex virus, 
adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus.(11)
In lung transplant recipients, fungal pneu￾monia, which is typically caused by Aspergillus
spp. or Candida spp., is less common than is 
CMV pneumonia but is associated with higher 
mortality.(11,16,17) Fungal pneumonia most often 
donor lung and becomes severe in 50-60% of 
such cases.(11) Secondary infection results from 
exposure to a different CMV strain or from reac￾tivation of a latent infection in the recipient and 
is usually less severe than is primary infection.(11)
Clinical manifestations of CMV infection include 
dyspnea, fever, malaise and leukopenia, although 
many patients with histologically proven CMV 
pneumonia are asymptomatic.(15) A diagnosis 
of CMV pneumonia is typically confirmed only 
after bronchoalveolar lavage and transbron￾chial biopsy. The radiologic manifestations of 
CMV pneumonia include, as shown in Figure 3, 
ground-glass opacities, interlobular septal 
thickening and consolidation, as well as diffuse 
reticular or reticulonodular opacities, nodules 
and small areas of effusion.(14) In lung trans￾a b

filling defects, localized arterial distention and 
abrupt arterial occlusion. Nonvascular findings 
include wedge-shaped consolidation, “mosaic 
hypoperfusion” (mosaic oligemia), atelectasis 
and pleural effusion.(18)
Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia 
The prevalence of cryptogenic organizing 
pneumonia among lung transplant recipients is 
10-28%.(19) This clinicopathologic syndrome—
characterized clinically by subacute or chronic 
respiratory illness and pathologically by polypoid 
masses of granulation tissue in the lumen of 
small airways, alveolar ducts, and some alveoli—is 
associated with a variable degree of interstitial 
and airspace infiltration by mononuclear cells 
and foamy macrophages.(19) An HRCT scan often 
reveals airspace consolidation, ground-glass 
opacities, nodular or mass-like consolidation and 
linear or reticular opacities (Figure 5). Additional 
findings include bronchiectasis, bronchiolectasis, 
fibrosis, lung volume loss and air trapping.(19)
Chronic rejection
Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) is 
defined as a clinical syndrome of progressive, 
irreversible airway obstruction in the pulmonary 
allograft caused by the presence of constric￾tive (obliterative) bronchiolitis,(5) which results 
from eosinophilic fibrous scarring of the small 
airways. The term BOS is used to describe less 
specific graft dysfunction featuring physiologic 
airflow obstruction and a decline in FEV1
 in rela￾occurs within the first 2 months after trans￾plantation.(11) Infection with Aspergillus spp. 
can present either as an indolent pneumonia or 
as a fulminant invasive infection with systemic 
dissemination.(16,17) Aspergillus infection can also 
cause ulcerative tracheobronchitis that is often 
radiographically occult and can lead to anas￾tomotic dehiscence.(11,17) Although Candida spp. 
frequently colonize the airways, invasive 
pulmonary infection is rare.(11) Fungal anasto￾motic infection or pneumonia is suspected on 
the basis of positive smears/cultures of bron￾choalveolar lavage samples. However, since 
these organisms can colonize the donor lung, 
definitive diagnosis of invasive fungal infection 
might require transbronchial biopsy.(11) Typical 
features on HRCT images include the following: 
focal nodular and mass-like regions of consoli￾dation; cavitation; nodules (solitary or multiple) 
with a surrounding rim of ground-glass opacity, 
referred to as the “halo” sign (Figure 4); and 
pleural thickening.(16,17)
Pulmonary embolism and infarction
In lung transplant recipients, pulmonary 
thromboembolic events tend to occur within 
the first 4 months after transplantation.(18) The 
incidence of such events has been reported to 
be 27%.(18) Radiographic findings are relatively 
nonspecific and indirect; the most common 
being pleural effusion. Pulmonary CT angiog￾raphy is the diagnostic method of choice in 
suspected cases of pulmonary thromboembolic 
disease. The CT findings include central arterial

patients presenting clinical or indirect features, 
direct bronchoscopy should be performed in 
order to identify possible mucosal necrosis.(21)
Bronchial anastomotic stenosis and bronchoma￾lacia are usually seen within the first 4 months 
after lung transplantation. However, the overall 
incidence of airway complications is decreasing 
due to improvements in preservation methods, 
surgical techniques and immunosuppressive 
therapy. Bronchial narrowing due to stricture, 
with significant stenosis, defined as a reduction 
of more than 50% in bronchial diameter,(21) can 
be seen on CT scans. In cases of bronchomalacia, 
airway collapse or transient narrowing of the 
anastomosis (or of other airway segments) can 
be detected through expiratory CT or dynamic 
CT during respiration.(21) Bronchomalacia can 
also be detected at bronchoscopy during spon￾taneous breathing.(21)
tion to the postoperative baseline value. Chronic 
allograft rejection remains the principal late 
complication of lung transplantation; affecting 
at least 50% of recipients within 5 years, 
irrespective of specific risk factors.(20) The radio￾graphic manifestations of BOS are nonspecific 
and include subsegmental atelectasis, decreased 
peripheral vascular markings and peribronchial 
cuffing, as well as reduced or increased lung 
volumes.(20) The CT findings of chronic rejection 
include, as shown in Figure 6, bronchial wall 
thickening, nodular/linear branching opacities, 
interlobular septal thickening and peribroncho￾vascular infiltrates, as well as bronchiectasis, air 
trapping, regional volume expansion/contrac￾tion, mosaic lung attenuation and decreased/
distorted peripheral arteries.(20) Dilated bronchi 
and bronchiectasis, as well as air trapping (which 
is pronounced in the lower lobes), are better 
demonstrated through HRCT imaging studies. 
Bronchial anastomosis complications
Complications at the bronchial anastomosis 
occur in approximately 15% of lung transplant 
recipients. Such complications include bronchial 
stenosis (Figure 7), dehiscence, bronchoma￾lacia, exophytic granulation tissue formation 
and anastomotic infection.(5) In 50% of cases, 
balloon dilatation or bronchial stent placement 
is required.(5) Donor bronchus ischemia caused 
by disruption of the native bronchial circulation 
is a key factor underlying airway complica￾tions.(6) Pulmonary infection is an additional 
exacerbating factor. In the early postoperative 
period, ischemia can result in bronchial dehis￾cence or fistula.(5) Bronchial dehiscence typically 
occurs within the first month after lung trans￾plantation. Anastomotic dehiscence is identified 
based on CT findings of bronchial wall defect, 
bronchial narrowing (fixed or dynamic), bron￾chial wall irregularity or extraluminal air.(21)
Multiplanar and three-dimensional CT recon￾structions provide precise information regarding 
the extent of these complications. Indirect 
features of bronchial anastomosis complication 
include air leak, manifesting as pneumothorax, 
pneumomediastinum or stenosis and resulting 
in poor allograft expansion, as evidenced by 
ipsilateral lung volume loss.(21) Unfortunately, 
CT does not reliably depict mucosal necrosis, 
which is the earliest sign and a useful predictor 
of dehiscence. When CT findings are negative in

Post-transplant lymphoproliferative 
disorder
Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder 
(PTLD) is an uncommon but serious complication 
of immunosuppressive therapy following solid 
organ transplantation. It has been shown to occur 
in up to 5% of patients, depending on the type 
of organ transplanted, as well as on the type and 
duration of immunosuppressive therapy.(22) It is 
much more common for PTLD to occur after lung 
transplantation than after liver or kidney trans￾plantation.(22) The presentation of PTLD consists 
of a spectrum of lymphoid neoplasms that are 
primarily of B-cell origin.(22) Approximately 90% 
of patients with PTLD are infected with Epstein￾Barr virus. Seronegative status for Epstein-Barr 
virus prior to transplantation is thought to be a 
major risk factor for the development of PTLD, the 
incidence of which varies from 2.8% to 6.1% at 
1 year after transplantation.(22) When the disorder 
appears in the early postoperative period, it tends 
to follow a benign course and responds favorably 
to antiviral therapy and a reduction of immuno￾suppression. Late disease, which can develop more 
than 1 year after transplantation and is predomi￾nantly accompanied by extrathoracic involvement, 
is most often treated with chemotherapy and 
irradiation.(22) The radiographic manifestations 
of PTLD include multiple pulmonary nodules, 
predominantly in the peripheral and basal zones 
(Figure 8). Other less common patterns of involve￾ment include air space consolidation, mediastinal/
hilar lymphadenopathy, masses (in the pleura or 
chest wall), effusion (pericardial or pleural) and 
thymus enlargement.(22)
Final considerations
In summary, the most common and significant 
complications of lung transplantation are reper￾fusion edema, acute rejection, chronic rejection, 
CMV infection and cryptogenic organizing pneu￾monia, as well as dehiscence or stenosis of the 
bronchial anastomosis. In lung transplant recipi￾ents, a finding of pulmonary infiltrates, mediastinal 
shift, pleural effusion, pneumothorax or pneumo￾mediastinum demands further investigation.
