Abstract. Mitochondrial disorders are amongst the most 
common groups of inborn errors of metabolism. They are 
caused by deficiencies in the final pathway of the cellular 
energy production, the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The 
disorders are clinically and genetically heterogeneous and the 
aetiology could be found in the mitochondrial, or in the nuclear 
genome. We searched important e‑databases for the collection 
of latest literature on the mitochondrial disease especially in 
pediatric population. Most of the studies in the recent past have 
focused on the understanding of the clinical phenotypes and 
pathophysiological mechanisms. Leigh syndrome is a common 
severe, neurodegenerative disease of early childhood. A defect 
in the POLG gene is another common observation in most of 
the cases leading to Alpers syndrome. The review concludes 
that pediatric mitochondrial disorders are severe, progressive 
and usually multi‑systemic. Further, whole genome sequencing 
is an excellent diagnostic option.

1. Introduction
Mitochondrial disorders are highly heterogeneous with 
regard to the clinical phenotype, as well as the genotype (1). 
The clinical spectrum is extremely broad, from multi‑organ, 
life‑threatening disease at birth to single symptoms with onset 
in middle age. The genetic cause of a mitochondrial disease can 
be found either in the mitochondrial or in the nuclear genome. 
We expect approximately one third of the paediatric patients 
to have disease‑causing variants in mitochondrial DNA 
(mtDNA) (2) and the rest to carry pathogenic variants in nuclear 
genes. To date, more than 250 nuclear genes have been linked 
to mitochondrial disease (3). Once a mitochondrial disorder is 
suspected, the diagnostic procedure is a challenge. There is no 
specific test to exclude or confirm the diagnosis. Nevertheless, 
it is of great importance for these patients and their families to 
establish a definite diagnosis on the genetic level.
2. Clinical features of mitochondrial disease
Mitochondrial disorders are clinically heterogeneous. 
Symptoms can emerge from any organ or tissue, although the 
central nervous system (CNS) and skeletal muscles are the 
above all most frequently affected tissues, owing to their high 
energy demands. In infancy and early childhood, the disease 
is often multi‑systemic, with involvement of not only the CNS 
and muscles, but also the liver, heart, kidneys and bone marrow, 
to mention the most frequently involved organs. Early onset 
of the disease indicates a severe defect in the mitochondrial 
respiratory chain, and this is related to a poorer prognosis (4). 
Mitochondrial disorders, with an onset in the adolescence 
or adulthood, are more often single‑organ diseases, such as 
CPEO, or LHON.
3. Symptoms and signs from the CNS
Symptoms from the CNS are seen in the majority of children 
with mitochondrial diseases. The most frequent symptom is a 
developmental delay (5), which is usually global and affects 
cognitive, language and motor skills. The end‑point cognitive 
level varies, from mild learning disabilities to severe mental 
retardation. There is probably no specific cognitive profile 
since mitochondrial disorders are, in all aspects, extremely

heterogeneous. A study by Turconi et al indicated a greater 
impairment in the non‑verbal area, particularly the visuo‑
spatial abilities. Impairment of the verbal short-term memory 
(working memory) was also seen (6). Symptoms from the 
autism spectrum are seen as well, and one hypothesis is that 
mitochondrial dysfunction can be part of the disease mecha￾nism in autism spectrum disorders in general (7).
Seizures are a frequent complication of mitochondrial 
disease at all ages. The exact prevalence is not known, but it 
is estimated to be approximately 40% (8). Recurrent status 
epilepticus was seen in as many as 60% of the patients. Also 
epileptic syndromes, such as West syndrome and Lennox‑
Gastaut syndrome have been reported (9). Alpers syndrome 
(AS), due to recessive mutations in the POLG gene, is one 
of the most common mitochondrial syndromes associated 
with epilepsy (10). AS patients often show focal, myoclonic 
or complex seizures. Status epilepticus is common, some￾times starting with epilepsia partialis continua, followed by a 
generalised, therapy‑resistant status. Electroencephalography 
(EEG) may initially show characteristic unilateral, occipital, 
high‑amplitude, slow waves with superimposed polyspikes, 
evolving into a generalised pattern (11). The energy failure is an 
important factor, but other aspects of a mitochondrial dysfunc￾tion, such as ROS production, disturbed calcium homeostasis 
and apoptosis are likely to contribute (12). Movement disorders 
are seen in a substantial proportion of the patients with mito￾chondrial diseases. In the paediatric population, dystonias are 
the most frequent symptoms, and are seen particularly in Leigh 
syndrome (LS) (13). This is not surprising, as the syndrome 
includes lesions in the basal ganglia and other extrapyramidal 
structures, from which these types of symptoms arise. Ataxia 
is not classified as a movement disorder, but it is a common 
symptom in several mitochondrial phenotypes caused by muta￾tions in either mtDNA or nDNA (14). Neurological symptoms 
in mitochondrial disease are often progressive, and sometimes 
rapid, with developmental arrest and loss of skills. The progres￾sion can also be stepwise, with a preceding infection or other 
catabolic situation. Some patients have a very slow progression, 
appearing like a static condition. A considerable proportion of 
patients suffer from acute neurological events, such as stroke￾like episodes, status epilepticus, coma, vomiting or lethargy.
4. Symptoms from skeletal muscle
Myopathy is the above all most common single symptom in 
mitochondrial disease. It is often part of an encephalomyopathy 
with additional symptoms from other organs, but pure myopathic 
presentations are seen in the adult, as well as the paediatric popu￾lation. The isolated mitochondrial myopathy typically presents 
with axial and proximal muscle weakness. Distal weakness 
has been reported in sporadic cases in the myopathic group 
and occurs regularly in the group of patients with mitochon￾drial polyneuropathies and neurogenic muscle weakness (15). 
Exercise intolerance and a general fatigue are other hallmarks 
of the mitochondrial myopathy. Infantile‑onset mitochondrial 
myopathies are usually severe disorders with pronounced weak￾ness, hypotonia and a need for ventilation support and intensive 
care. It is important to be aware of a subset of patients with this 
severe phenotype and a cytochrome c oxidase (COX)‑deficiency, 
who turn out to have a reversible disease.
5. Ophthalmological manifestations
Ophthalmological findings in mitochondrial disease are 
common, although the frequency remains unclear (16). The 
extraocular muscles are strongly dependent on a sufficient 
energy supply, with mitochondria occupying approximately 
60% of the cell volume (17). It is therefore not surprising, that 
external ophthalmoplegia is a common finding in patients 
with mitochondrial disorders. Optic atrophy is often part of a 
systemic disease with CNS involvement, as in LS. It can also 
appear in isolation, such as in patients with LHON. In this 
disease, the function of the retinal ganglion cells is specifically 
affected, which results in subacute, painless, bilateral visual 
failure (18). Occasionally, additional symptoms could be seen, 
preferentially from the nervous system (19). The onset of 
disease usually occurs in young adulthood, but childhood onset 
is also seen. Pigmentary retinopathy is another non‑specific 
sign of retinal dysfunction that has been associated with a 
variety of mtDNA and nDNA mutations. Other abnormalities 
of the eye and/or vision to be mentioned are cataract, cortical 
blindness and homonymous hemianopsy.
6. Hepatopathy and gastrointestinal symptoms
Hepatic disease is estimated to occur in 10‑20% of patients 
with mitochondrial disease and usually presents in early child￾hood (20). The spectrum of severity ranges from transient 
elevated liver transaminases to acute, fatal liver failure early 
in life. The causes of mitochondrial hepatopathies are mainly: 
i) Disorders of mtDNA maintenance, ii) defects in mitochon￾drial protein synthesis, iii) defects of RC complex assembly 
and iv) disorders of the mitochondrial lipid membranes (21).
Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in mitochondrial 
disorders, regardless of the genetic backgrounds, although 
they are more prominent in association with certain defects. 
The mechanism behind the symptoms varies and is sometimes 
caused by a combination of different tissue/organ involvements. 
Mitochondrial neuro‑gastrointestinal encephalomyopathy 
(MNGIE), caused by a deficiency of thymidine phosphory￾lase, due to mutations in TYMP, is characterized by severe 
gastrointestinal dysmotility, and even a chronic intestinal 
pseudoobstruction (22). The syndrome frequently presents 
in adolescence or young adulthood and additional features 
are cachexia, peripheral neuropathy and/or ophthalmoplegia. 
Hearing impairment is common and most patients develop a 
leukoencephalopathy in adulthood (23). Similar phenotypes, 
with severe gastrointestinal dysmotility, have been reported 
with mutations in other genes involved in mtDNA mainte￾nance, POLG being one example (24).
Diarrhoea, owing to exocrine pancreas insufficiency, is a 
cardinal feature of Pearson syndrome. Pearson syndrome is 
the most frequently seen phenotype in the early onset of a 
disease caused by a large‑scale deletion in mtDNA. Additional 
symptoms in Pearson syndrome are transfusion‑dependent 
anaemia and lactic acidosis (25). Liver failure, renal tubular 
acidosis and diabetes mellitus can further complicate the 
clinical picture. Patients with LS, described in detail below, 
often have more diffuse gastrointestinal symptoms, such as 
failure to thrive, feeding difficulties and vomiting. The caus￾ative factors behind these symptoms are probably multiple

in nature, including involvement of the CNS, gastrointestinal 
tract, muscles and peripheral nerves.
7. Endocrine dysfunction
Steroid hormones are synthesized within the mitochondria 
and a dysfunction of ATP production leads to impaired 
hormone production and endocrinological symptoms. Overall, 
endocrinological manifestations seem to be most common 
in the phenotypes caused by defects of mtDNA, particularly 
large‑scale deletions and point mutations in tRNA genes. 
Patients with nuclear gene defects may also present with these 
symptoms, most frequently involving gene defects affecting 
mtDNA maintenance and translation (26).
Diabetes mellitus is the best described endocrine manifesta￾tion. The mechanism of diabetes in mitochondrial disease is not 
only a matter of decreased insulin secretion owing to a deficient 
ATP supply, but is also caused by the impairment of the mitochon￾drial role as a glucose sensor, connecting glucose metabolism to 
insulin release (27). Diabetes mellitus is also frequently seen 
in Kearns‑Sayre syndrome, caused by large‑scale deletions in 
mtDNA. In Pearson syndrome, exocrine pancreas dysfunction is 
a more prominent feature, but diabetes is seen as well (28). Short 
stature is common in patients with mitochondrial disorders. In 
some of these patients a growth hormone deficiency can be 
established. In other patients, the underlying mechanisms are 
yet unknown. Additional endocrinological manifestations that 
should be mentioned are hypothyroidism, hypoparathyroidism, 
adrenal insufficiency and hypogonadism.
8. Symptoms from organ or tissue
Kidney. Renal manifestations of mitochondrial disease have 
been reported in association with mtDNA mutations, as well as 
numerous nuclear genes. Most usual is a tubular dysfunction, 
varying from a mild hyperaminoaciduria, which might only 
occur during illness. The more pronounced tubulopathies are 
frequently associated with large‑scale deletions in mtDNA and 
the clinical features of Pearson or Kearns‑Sayre syndrome (29).
Heart. Cardiomyopathies are the most frequent cardiac 
manifestations of mitochondrial disease and are estimated 
to occur in 20‑40% of the patients. Hypertrophic cardiomy￾opathies are most common, but dilated, restrictive and other 
types are also seen. The severity ranges from asymptomatic, 
sometimes spontaneously reversible conditions, to a severe 
cardiomyopathy with an early, even prenatal, onset that causes 
death in early infancy. The presence of a cardiomyopathy in a 
mitochondrial disorder, regardless of its severity, is associated 
with a poorer prognosis (30). Arrythmias, conduction defects 
and pulmonary hypertension are examples of other more rare 
cardiac manifestations (31).
Hearing. Hearing impairment/deafness is a symptom of 
several mitochondrial phenotypes, caused by mutations in 
mtDNA, as well as in nDNA. The prevalence varies in different 
studies, but a minimal frequency is approximately 20% (32).
9. Leigh syndrome
LS, is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder of infancy and 
early childhood. It is the most common pediatric mitochondrial 
syndrome. It is now confirmed that LS is primarily a disease 
of the deep grey matter and sometimes involving the white 
matter. Lesions are characteristically seen in the basal ganglia, 
thalami, brainstem, cerebellum and spinal cord and consist 
of areas of demyelination, gliosis, necrosis, spongiosis and 
vascular proliferation (33). The neurological symptoms include 
developmental delay/arrest, followed by loss of skills, axial 
hypotonia, increasing tonus in the arms and legs, ataxia and 
dystonia. Ophthalmological abnormalities, such as nystagmus 
and optic atrophy, are frequently seen (34), as well as senso￾rineural hearing impairment and epilepsy. Additionally, a 
diversity of non‑neurological symptoms, such as cardiomy￾opathy, hepatopathy, renal tubular dysfunction or hormonal 
deficiencies, may constitute parts of the phenotype.
LS is most usually caused by a dysfunction of the mitochon￾drial respiratory chain, although the syndrome can be seen in 
other inborn errors of metabolism. It is a common phenotype 
in different conditions that causes severe failure of oxidative 
metabolism in the mitochondria of the developing brain. 
The underlying genetic causes are heterogeneous. More than 
75 different nuclear genes are reported to be causative (35).
10. Alpers syndrome
AS, also named Alpers‑Huttenlocher syndrome, is another 
neurodegenerative mitochondrial encephalopathy of infancy 
and early childhood (36). The phenotype is characterized 
by intractable epilepsy, developmental regression and hepa￾topathy with or without liver failure. The disease primarily 
affects grey matter in the brain, particularly the cerebral 
cortex, cerebellum and thalami. Pathology in the brain 
includes spongiosis, astrocytosis and neuronal loss. In the liver, 
hepatitis with fatty degeneration, hepatocyte loss, bile duct 
proliferation and fibrous scarring, with or without cirrhosis, 
have been described. In approximately 50% of the patients, 
the liver involvement is associated with exposure to sodium 
valproate (37). Additional symptoms include hypotonia, ataxia 
and cortical blindness. It is also associated with recessive 
mutations in the POLG gene (38).
11. Diagnosing mitochondrial disease
A detailed medical and family history and a thorough exami￾nation are essential for the further diagnostics. The family 
history may help to discriminate between maternal (indicating 
an mtDNA defect) and Mendelian inheritance of the disease. 
Clinical investigations include neurological, cardiac and 
ophthalmological evaluations and assessments of hearing, 
growth and psycho‑motor development. The finding of 
multiple organ involvement, especially the brain and muscles, 
further strengthens the suspicion of a mitochondrial disorder. 
The mapping of clinical symptoms and signs also serves to 
establish the extent of disease in order to plan the management 
and follow‑up of the specific individual.
Many of the more frequent symptoms, such as devel￾opmental retardation, hypotonia and failure to thrive, are 
non‑specific and seldom raise the suspicion of a mitochondrial 
disorder. Other symptoms, or constellations of symptoms, 
are less frequent and more specific and point directly to the 
mitochondria. Ataxia, external ophthalmoplegia and renal

tubulopathy are examples of ‘red flags’, signalling a potential 
mitochondrial disorder(39). Certain constellations of symptoms 
may even be clues to a specific mitochondrial syndrome, such 
as a combination of stroke‑like episodes, diabetes and hearing 
impairment, strongly suggesting the MELAS syndrome.
12. Neuroimaging
Neuroimaging is important in all patients with CNS involve￾ment. Structural MRI is the standard investigation. Modern 
functional brain imaging methods, such as magnetic reso￾nance spectroscopy, diffusion weighted imaging and perfusion 
MRI may provide valuable information regarding brain 
metabolism (39). Non‑specific findings of cerebral atrophy 
or leukodystrophy are common. Certain imaging patterns are 
more distinct, and may be helpful in further biochemical and 
genetic investigations, such as identification of typical features 
of LS or AS. Stroke‑like lesions, predominantly located in 
grey matter and not following vascular territories, suggest a 
MELAS syndrome (40).
13. Clinical chemistry
Routine parameters, such as a full blood count, glucose, creatine 
kinase (CK) and laboratory parameters of liver, parathyroid, 
thyroid and renal function are evaluated to characterise the 
systemic involvement of the disease.
Lactic acid is an important, although non‑specific 
biomarker of mitochondrial disease. A substantial propor￾tion of patients may have consistently normal, or minimally 
elevated, lactate levels in the blood, as well as the CSF (39). 
Conversely, elevated blood or CSF lactate levels are seen in a 
range of conditions not linked to RC disorders. Inappropriate 
collection or handling of the samples may also result in a high 
concentration of lactate in the sample (41).
The more specific metabolic work‑up serves to exclude 
other metabolic differential diagnoses and to find abnormali￾ties, which further strengthen the suspicion of a mitochondrial 
disorder. Urinary organic acids are included in the diagnos￾tics of virtually all types of metabolic disorders. Patients 
with mitochondrial disorders might have normal excretion, 
although abnormalities frequently occur. Most common is 
a non‑specific increased excretion of lactate. Acylcarnitine 
profiles may reveal primary organic acidaemias, primary fatty 
acid oxidation disorders or a secondary fatty acid oxidation 
dysfunction due to the OXPHOS defect (42).
14. Muscle biopsy
Muscle biopsy is the golden standard procedure in inves￾tigations of mitochondrial function. Muscle morphology 
is studied by means of light and electron microscopy, using 
histochemical and immunohistochemical methods (43). The 
finding of ‘ragged red fibres’ (RRF) is strongly suggestive of a 
mitochondrial disorder. RRF is a pattern caused by subsarco￾lemmal accumulation of mitochondria. The presence of fibres 
deficient in COX activity is another hallmark of mitochondrial 
disease. Neither RRF nor COX‑negative fibres are specific for 
a mitochondrial disorder, but they may appear secondarily to 
other, non‑mitochondrial myopathies (44). Electron micros￾copy may demonstrate a variety of abnormalities associated 
with mitochondrial disease. The mitochondria often observed 
to be enlarged, with abnormal shapes, absent cristae and para￾crystalline inclusions.
15. Molecular genetics
Further genetic tests are performed based on the findings in the 
muscle biopsy (45,46). Isolated enzyme complex deficiencies 
indicate mutations in genes encoding subunits of the complex 
or assembly factors. Complexes I, III, IV and V contain subunits 
encoded by mtDNA as well as nDNA, whereas a complex II 
deficiency is expected to be caused by mutations in nuclear 
genes. Combined enzyme deficiencies including complexes I, 
III, IV and V indicate a deficiency of mtDNA expression or 
maintenance. Causative mutations may be found in mitochon￾drial tRNA genes, but more often in nuclear genes. Occasionally, 
genetic analyses are performed without a preceding mitochon￾drial assay in muscle tissue. LHON is an example of that, with a 
specific clinical picture which, in more than 90% of the patients, 
is caused by one of three different mtDNA mutations.
Sequence analysis of the entire mitochondrial genome is 
usually the first step in the molecular part of the diagnostic 
procedure. It is relatively easily done and, if negative, rules out 
maternal (mitochondrial) inheritance of the disease. mtDNA 
mutation analyses are preferably performed in muscle tissue, 
since mtDNA molecules harbouring point mutations or large 
deletions tend to accumulate in non‑dividing cells, such as 
muscle and nerve cells, but are eliminated in the rapidly 
dividing blood cells (47). Urinary epithelial cells and buccal 
mucosa cells are alternative cell types, with the advantage of 
a non‑invasive sample collection. Once a causative mutation in 
mtDNA is excluded, hundreds of nuclear genes remain to be 
investigated. Sanger sequence analyses of selected genes are 
seldom cost‑effective since identical signs and symptoms may 
be caused by mutations in many different genes.
The new techniques of massively parallel DNA sequencing 
have greatly increased our ability to establish a genetic 
diagnosis in patients with mitochondrial disorders, and have 
recently been implemented in the clinical setting (48,49). As 
prices have fallen and techniques have further developed, the 
use of whole genome sequencing (WGS) is preferred and has 
gradually been implemented at many centres for mitochondrial 
diagnostics. WGS enables variant detection also in non‑coding 
regions, such as the introns. A WES analysis identifies approx￾imately 20,000 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) per genome, 
whereas WGS identifies as many as four million.
16. Prenatal diagnostics
Prenatal diagnostic analyses of mitochondrial disease are usually 
based on genetic findings(50). In families with a disorder caused 
by identified mutations in a nuclear gene, molecular analyses in 
a chorionic villus sample (CVS) or cultured amniocytes could 
be performed in a customary manner. A preimplantatory genetic 
diagnosis (PGD) might also be an option for these families. 
Prenatal diagnostics of mtDNA mutations are more complicated 
owing to the fact that most pathogenic mtDNA mutations are 
heteroplasmic. Preimplantatory genetic diagnostics is currently 
used only to a limited extent.

17. Conclusions
It was concluded from the above that pediatric mitochondrial 
disorders are severe, progressive and usually multi‑systemic. 
Further, WGS is an excellent diagnostic option.
