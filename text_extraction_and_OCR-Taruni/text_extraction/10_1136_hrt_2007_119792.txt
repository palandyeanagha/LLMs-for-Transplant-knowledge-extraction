ABSTRACT
Background: In recent large paediatric cardiomyopathy
population studies from North America and Australia,
vitamin D deficiency was not identified as a cause of
infant heart failure. However, rickets is resurgent in
developed countries.
Objective: To review the prevalence of this cardiomyo￾pathy in paediatric cardiology units of southeast England
and determine the prognosis.
Methods and results: A retrospective review from 2000
to 2006 in southeast England. Sixteen infants (6 Indian
subcontinent, 10 black ethnicity) were identified: median
(range) age at presentation was 5.3 months (3 weeks–
8 months). All had been breast fed. Ten presented at the
end of the British winter (February–May). Median
shortening fraction was 10% (range 5–18%) and median
left ventricular end diastolic dimension z score was 4.1
(range 3.1–7.0). Six had a cardiac arrest; three infants
died. Eight were ventilated, two required mechanical
circulatory support and 12 required intravenous inotropic
support. Two were referred for cardiac transplantation.
Median (range) of biochemical values on admission was:
total calcium 1.5 (1.07–1.74) mmol/l; alkaline phospha￾tase 646 (340–1057) IU/l; 25-hydroxyvitamin D 18.5 (0–
46) nmol/l (normal range .35) and parathyroid hormone
34.3 (8.9–102) pmol/l (normal range ,6.1). The clinical
markers and echocardiographic indices of all survivors
have improved. The mean time from diagnosis to achieve
normal fractional shortening was 12.4 months.
Conclusions: Vitamin D deficiency and consequent
hypocalcaemia are seen in association with severe and
life-threatening infant heart failure. That no infant or
mother was receiving the recommended vitamin supple￾mentation highlights the need for adequate provision of
vitamin D to ethnic minority populations.
Rickets has been recognised in England for over
350 years.1 As the cause became better understood
it virtually disappeared in developed countries.
Unfortunately, there have been reports of a
resurgence of nutritional rickets in ethnic minority
populations in Europe2–8 and North America.9–15 A
few case reports of cardiomyopathy associated
with rickets have been published.16–19 The first
reported case of rickets cardiomyopathy in the
United States was published in 2003 as an
‘‘unusual cause of paediatric cardiomyopathy’’.19
Recently, extensive population studies have been
published with over 1500 cases of paediatric dilated
cardiomyopathy reported, but no cases of vitamin
D deficiency were identified.20–22 The recognition of
this diagnosis in a number of infants in cardiac
intensive care units in London prompted our study.
We report the presentation, and clinical outcome
in the first substantial case series of this problem.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
We reviewed the records of all known patients who
presented with dilated cardiomyopathy associated
with vitamin D deficiency between January 2000
and December 2006 to four cardiology referral
centres—Great Ormond Street Hospital, Royal
Brompton Hospital, Guy’s and St Thomas’
Hospital, all in London, and John Radcliffe
Hospital, Oxford. These centres receive all paedia￾tric cardiology referrals from southeast England, a
metropolitan area with a total population of about
18 million. Sixteen infants were identified. The
median (range) of age at presentation was
5.3 months (3 weeks to 8 months). All were
initially transferred from their local hospital.
Patients were investigated according to the local
cardiomyopathy protocol, which meant that there
was some variation in laboratory evaluation. Barth
syndrome was not specifically looked for, but no
infant had neutropenia and six were female.
Available demographic information, including age,
gender and racial/ethnic background, was identi￾fied and details of presentation, feeding habits,
maternal supplementation and clinical signs were
collected.
Calcium, ionised calcium, inorganic phosphate
and alkaline phosphatase were measured by
standard automated techniques. Vitamin D (as
25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD)) was measured by
radioimmunoassay. Parathyroid hormone (PTH)
was measured using a two-site assay that measures
‘‘intact’’ hormone.
Only infants admitted as emergency inpatients
to high-dependency or intensive care units were
included. Low cardiac output heart failure was
defined as hypotension, poor perfusion and breath￾lessness. Dilated cardiomyopathy was defined as a
left ventricular end diastolic dimension of over 2 z
values with impaired systolic function. Because
this was a retrospective study using only data that
had been collected for clinical purposes, prospective
ethical committee approval was not sought.
RESULTS
All infants had clinical heart failure, most requiring
ventilatory and inotropic support (table 1).
Six infants were resuscitated from an episode
of cardiopulmonary arrest within 24 hours of
Heart failure and cardiomyopathy

admission. Another infant could not be resuscitated and died.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support for low cardiac
output was needed in two cases for 7 and 13 days. One of the
children mechanically supported had neurological damage and
ventilatory support was withdrawn 6 weeks after presentation.
Two infants were assessed for cardiac transplantation, one of
whom was listed for transplant, but was withdrawn from the
transplant waiting list because of clinical improvement. There
was one late sudden death 8 months after presentation in an
infant who had improved clinically, although echocardiographic
parameters remained abnormal.
Electrocardiograms showed sinus rhythm in all and there was
no evidence of QTc prolongation. Echocardiograms showed very
dilated left ventricles in each case, with accompanying poor
systolic function (table 2).
All of the infants belonged to dark-skinned ethnic minority
groups. Most (10/16) presented at the end of the British winter.
Twelve of them were exclusively breast fed; four others were
initially breast fed and were being weaned onto solids. None of
the infants or mothers had received vitamin D or calcium
supplementation prenatally or postnatally.
Table 2 presents the biochemical values. All infants were
profoundly hypocalcaemic. Alkaline phosphatase was raised in
all except one. The PTH level was raised in all patients. 25-OHD
levels were available in 14 patients before the start of treatment.
Vitamin D levels probably need to be .50 nmol/l in order to
maintain physiological suppression of PTH,23 but a level lower
than about 35 nmol/l marks the point at which vitamin D
deficiency usually becomes manifest. In our cases the median
level of vitamin D was ,20 nmol/l, but we have included one
case aged 3 weeks at presentation who had a level of 43 nmol/l.
However, in all cases PTH values were uniformly raised and
initial calcium/ionised calcium uniformly low.
Ten patients had radiological evidence of rickets. Maternal
biochemistry was available for all of them, and all mothers had
normal calcium, phosphate and alkaline phosphatase levels.
Unfortunately PTH and 25-OHD levels were measured in only
five of them as the local laboratories did not consider these
investigations to be indicated in the other mothers in view of
their normal biochemistry. Of these five women, three had
raised PTH and low 25-OHD levels and the remaining two had
normal values. Once vitamin D deficiency was diagnosed or
suspected, replacement therapy was started. Nine infants
received cholecalciferol, three had ergocalciferol and the rest
alfacalcidol. All received calcium supplements. Appropriate
dietary advice was given to parents. Mothers found to have
vitamin D deficiency or who decided to continue breast feeding
also received vitamin D and calcium supplements. Calcium
supplements in the infants were generally stopped at 2–
3 months, but vitamin D supplements were continued for at
least 6 months. All had normal calcium levels after 1 month of
treatment.
A postmortem examination was performed in one of the
infants who died. There was a large pericardial effusion. The
heart was enlarged and weighed 62 g (expected weight 34 g).
The left ventricle was dilated and showed concentric hyper￾trophy with mild fibrous thickening of the endocardium The
myocardial fibres were hypertrophied without disarray (fig 1).
Their nuclei were enlarged and hyperchromatic and many
myofibres were stretched and thinned. There was a mild
increase in interstitial fibrous tissue, particularly in the
subendocardial regions. The endocardium was thickened by
fibroelastic tissue. The vessels were normal. There was no
inflammatory cell infiltrate and apoptosis was not evident in
the myocytes. The costochondral junctions were swollen and
ovoid.
Surviving infants were reviewed regularly. Figure 2 shows a
Kaplan–Meier curve demonstrating the return to normal
fractional shortening using data from echocardiography reviews
at 6-monthly intervals. Recovery of left ventricular fractional
shortening to the normal range occurred at a mean of
12.4 months from presentation.
DISCUSSION
Recently, large population studies of paediatric cardiomyopathy
have been published. In one paper 1426 cases of dilated
cardiomyopathy were described, the largest series ever
reported.20 A population-based study of 184 cases from
Australia was also recently published.21 In a further report the
aetiology of over 900 cases of paediatric cardiomyopathy was
recorded.22 However, in these large series, no cases were
attributed to vitamin D deficiency. The incidence of heart
failure (excluding those cases associated with congenital heart
disease) in infants and children in the UK and Ireland has
recently been shown to be 106 cases a year. About 40% of these
were infants (data presented at the 4th World Congress of
Paediatric Cardiology, Argentina, 2005). This report of 16 cases
of rickets-associated heart failure in infants seen over a period of
6 years (2.7 a year) in the southeast of England alone, suggests
that many cases of infant heart failure may be linked to rickets
in the UK in the present era. It should be emphasised that the
infants in this series had overt and severe clinical heart failure,
and it seems very likely that many infants from these ethnic
groups would have had undetected subclinical, but potentially
important, cardiac abnormality during the same era.

All the infants we have reported on were from dark-skinned
ethnic minorities, were breast fed and 10/16 presented at the
end of the British winter (February–May). Lack of sunlight
exposure is important, as the main source of vitamin D is from
ultraviolet radiation of the skin; there is no radiation of the
appropriate wavelength (290–310 nm) in Britain from the end
of October to the end of March.6 Darker-skinned people require
more exposure to sunlight than lighter-skinned people to
manufacture vitamin D.6 23 Measurement of vitamin D con￾centration in the non-pregnant adult population in
Birmingham, UK showed that in winter 85% of Asian people,
compared with 3.3% of non-Asian subjects, had a vitamin D
concentration of ,8 ng/ml.6 In the infants we have reported on,
breast feeding is also likely to have been an important factor as
little vitamin D is present in breast milk. Fetal levels may be
maintained by initial passage of 25-OHD across the placenta,
provided that the maternal vitamin D status is adequate.
Possibly, the finding of vitamin D deficiency was coincidental
and the infants we have presented may have had cardiomyo￾pathy from other causes. However, all infants were profoundly
hypocalcaemic, PTH values were uniformly raised and initial
calcium/ionised calcium levels uniformly low. Calcium levels
are checked routinely in children admitted with heart failure,
yet hypocalcaemia was not a feature of the large series of
paediatric cardiomyopathies.20–22 None of the centres in our
study saw any cases of hypocalcaemia and cardiomyopathy in
white infants during the study period, although cardiomyo￾pathy with normal calcium was seen in this latter group. Cases
of cardiomyopathy were also seen in dark-skinned infants who
did not have hypocalcaemia during this period. Only infants
with hypocalcaemia were investigated and the PTH level
determined; if this was abnormal the vitamin D level was also
obtained. All infants with hypocalcaemia and cardiomyopathy
during this period are included in this report. In adults,
hypocalcaemia alone is sufficient to induce dilated cardiomyo￾pathy.24–28 Children have also been reported to develop heart
failure in hypoparathyroidism.29 Treatment with antifailure
drugs and calcium alone was sufficient to enable recovery.30 31
Recovery was not always rapid in these cases, which is
consistent with the slow improvement period in our patients.
Slow recovery of function in infants with severe heart failure
from myocarditis is also well known.32
The severity of the heart failure associated with vitamin D
deficiency in the infants we have described is surprising and, as
far as we know, has not been documented previously.
Nevertheless, the outcome is good in survivors. The time course
of recovery we have documented may be of help to physicians
and families of infants with this problem and would suggest
cardiac transplantation is rarely needed for this diagnosis. It is of
concern that none of the mothers or infants were receiving the
recommended vitamin D supplementation.
CONCLUSIONS
We have reported the first case series of infants with
cardiomyopathy seen in association with vitamin D deficiency
and hypocalcaemia. This series highlights inadequacies in the
provision of vitamin D supplementation to the ethnic minority
community in the UK.

Two- and three-dimensional imaging of coarctation
shelf in the human fetus
Fetal diagnosis of coarctation of the aorta
has high false-positive rates. Diagnosis has
been based on indirect signs such as
ventricular and arterial disproportion1 as
the coarctation shelf is not easily identifi￾able prenatally.2 These images illustrate
that direct imaging of the coarctation
shelf in the fetus is possible.
Fetal echocardiography (FE) was per￾formed at 20 weeks of gestation in a 35-
year-old primigravida owed to ventricular
disproportion. Right-to-left asymmetry
was present at ventricular (mitral/tricus￾pid valves = 3.6 mm/5.8 mm) and arter￾ial level (aortic/pulmonary valves =
2.3 mm/4.7 mm). Direct imaging of the
aortic arch with power Doppler (3–5–
7.5 MHz probe, SSD 5500-PHD, Aloka,
Tokyo, Japan) showed a discrete posterior
narrowing at the isthmus (panel A). At
36 weeks, three-dimensional FE was per￾formed. Static three-dimensional volumes
of the fetal heart with colour flow
mapping were acquired (RAB 4–8 MHz
probe, Voluson 730 Expert, GE Medical
Systems, Milwaukee, WI, USA). Volumes
were processed and rendered offline. A
localised posterior aortic shelf was demon￾strated within the aortic isthmus (panel
B, video). The diagnosis was confirmed
postnatally and end-to-end anastomosis
carried out on the first day of life.
