Abstract
Background: Heart failure related to cardiac siderosis remains a major cause of death in transfusion dependent
anaemias. Replacement fibrosis has been reported as causative of heart failure in siderotic cardiomyopathy in
historical reports, but these findings do not accord with the reversible nature of siderotic heart failure achievable
with intensive iron chelation.
Methods: Ten whole human hearts (9 beta-thalassemia major, 1 sideroblastic anaemia) were examined for iron
loading and fibrosis (replacement and interstitial). Five had died from heart failure, 4 had cardiac transplantation for
heart failure, and 1 had no heart failure (death from a stroke). Heart samples iron content was measured using
atomic emission spectroscopy. Interstitial fibrosis was quantified by computer using picrosirius red (PSR) staining
and expressed as collagen volume fraction (CVF) with normal value for left ventricle <3%.
Results: The 9 hearts affected by heart failure had severe iron loading with very low T2* of 5.0 ± 2.0 ms (iron
concentration 8.5 ± 7.0 mg/g dw) and diffuse granular myocardial iron deposition. In none of the 10 hearts was
significant macroscopic replacement fibrosis present. In only 2 hearts was interstitial fibrosis present, but with low
CVF: in one patient with no cardiac siderosis (death by stroke, CVF 5.9%) and in a heart failure patient (CVF 2%). In
the remaining 8 patients, no interstitial fibrosis was seen despite all having severe cardiac siderosis and heart failure
(CVF 1.86% ±0.87%).
Conclusion: Replacement cardiac fibrosis was not seen in the 9 post-mortem hearts from patients with severe
cardiac siderosis and heart failure leading to death or transplantation, which contrasts markedly to historical reports.
Minor interstitial fibrosis was also unusual and very limited in extent. These findings accord with the potential for
reversibility of heart failure seen in iron overload cardiomyopathy.

Background
The transfusion dependent anaemias cause a substantial
burden of morbidity and mortality, of which thalassae￾mia is the commonest single gene disorder worldwide
[1]. The transfusions that are necessary for survival
cause tissue iron loading, and this ultimately results in
heart failure as the major cause of death [2, 3]. Histo￾pathological studies of patients with cardiac siderosis
have indicated that replacement myocardial fibrosis is
prominent and causative of the heart failure [4, 5], but
these data were based on patients who died 50 years ago
or more and prior to the modern era of iron chelation
treatment. These historical data have now become con￾troversial because it is now recognised that the risk of
developing heart failure in beta-thalassaemia major is
closely associated with myocardial siderosis [6], heart
failure may be fully reversed with aggressive iron￾chelation treatment [7], and improvement in ventricular
function occurs in concert with myocardial iron reduc￾tion implying a causal relationship [8–10]. In other non￾transfusional cardiomyopathies such as hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy [11], dilated cardiomyopathy [12], and
arrhythmogenic right/left ventricular cardiomyopathy
[13, 14], macroscopic replacement cardiac fibrosis is a
prominent feature and is associated with deteriorating
cardiac function and an adverse outcome [15–18].
However, improvement in left ventricular function
with treatment is limited or not possible in these car￾diomyopathies, which may relate to the underlying
myopathy, but also because the replacement fibrosis
appears to be permanent. Therefore, we hypothesized
that the modern clinical finding of reversible ventricu￾lar dysfunction in myocardial siderosis is not driven by
replacement fibrosis. To investigate this, we analysed
hearts from transfusion dependent patients to examine
for cardiac fibrosis by histology and relate the findings
to iron overload cardiomyopathy.
Methods
Study hearts
Ten hearts were studied from 5 centres, with 9 from pa￾tients with beta thalassaemia major and 1 from a patient
with sideroblastic anaemia. A separate report associating
myocardial T2* to myocardial iron in these hearts has
been published [19]. Six of the hearts were obtained
post-mortem and 4 post cardiac transplantation. Three
patients had died from heart failure, 4 had cardiac trans￾plantation for heart failure, 2 had current heart failure
but had died from other causes (1 tamponade, 1 enceph￾alitis), and 1 had died from a stroke (no heart failure).
The mean blood units transfused was 28.2 ± 9.7 per
year per patient. Eight patients had received chelation
therapy with deferoxamine, and 2 patients had received
combination treatment with deferoxamine with deferi￾prone. Detailed patient demographics are shown in
Table 1.
Tissue sampling and iron analysis
The left ventricle (LV) was cut into 5 short axis ventricu￾lar slices and ex-vivo CMR was performed on each slice,
as described below. After imaging, each slice was divided
into 6 sectors and 3 layers (epicardial, mesocardial and
endocardial) making a total of 90 left ventricular samples
per heart. Transmural samples were also taken of the
right ventricle and both atria, and additional samples of
the conduction tissue and valves. All samples were
transported to a specialist lab for iron analysis in Perth,
Australia. Each sample underwent lyophilization and
acid digestion. Tissue iron concentration was measured
using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spec￾troscopy. Iron concentration values for the left ventricle
samples showed only minor variation within each heart
[19], and are therefore expressed as a mean whole heart
iron concentration ± standard deviation.
Histology
Whole blocks for histology were taken contiguous to the
samples taken for iron analysis. Fifty blocks in each case
was examined. The tissue blocks were fixed in formalin
and dehydrated and embedded in paraffin wax. Sections
were cut and stained with Picrosirius red (PSR) a stain
which highlights collagen [20, 21]. Perl’s stain for iron
detection [22, 23], and haematoxylin and eosin (H&E).
Each slide was examined under a standard light micro￾scope by two histopathologists for abnormalities, in par￾ticular the presence of fibrosis. Interstitial fibrosis was
defined as increased interstitial and/or perivascular col￾lagen without evidence of myocyte loss, or thin lines of
collagen around individual myocytes. Replacement fibro￾sis was defined as myocyte replacement with collagen.
Quantitative evaluation of fibrosis
After visual inspection, a representative digitized image
was acquired from each slide of up to 1.8 mm2 (ven￾tricular) or 0.3 mm2 (atrial). The images were analysed
using dedicated computer software (Nikon NIS ele￾ments) which enabled a direct measurement of the myo￾cardial tissue volume and PSR staining volume. The
fraction of PSR staining within the myocardium was de￾fined as the collagen volume fraction (CVF). Three stud￾ies published using this technique have shown a mean ±
SD value of CVF for the left ventricle of 2.1 ± 0.45%
[24–26], and for the right ventricle 2.5 ± 0.4% [23, 25].
Using the 2SD upper boundary this yields a normal
value for CVF of <3% in the LV, and <3.3% in the RV.
No normal quantitative values for the atria are available.

Cardiovascular magnetic resonance
Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) T2* imaging
is an established technique for assessing myocardial iron
loading [19, 27–29]. Each of the 5 short-axis slices from
each heart were scanned in-vitro at 37C to reproduce
in-vivo body conditions. A 1.5 T scanner (Sonata,
Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) was
used utilizing previously reported techniques [19, 30,
31]. In brief, a multi-echo T2* sequence (gradient echo)
was used: Range of echo times TE from 3.1 to 39.1 ms;
field of view 160x160mm; matrix 128x128; flip angle 20°;
number of excitations 2; bandwidth 810Hz per pixel; TR

Results
Heart iron deposition
Nine hearts had severe iron loading with a mean ex-vivo
LV T2* of 5.0 ± 2.0 ms and a mean LV iron concentra￾tion of 8.5 ± 7.0 mg/g dw (normal value <0.49 mg/g dw
[32]) and a mean weight of 298 ± 63.7 g. There was dif￾fuse granular iron deposition seen within all these 9
hearts. Nearly all myocytes showed homogenous positive
purple/blue granules within the cytoplasm with Perl’s
staining (Fig. 1). There was also homogenous positive
granular staining of the cytoplasm of macrophages
around blood vessels and within the interstitium of the
myocardium (Fig. 2). A similar but reduced pattern of
iron deposition was seen in the right ventricle and to a
lesser degree in the myocytes of the atria. The normal fi￾brous subendocardium layer of the atria had little or no
iron deposition, but positive staining was seen within
scattered macrophages. The valves, nerves, ganglia,
blood vessels, fat and connective tissue had little or no
iron deposition apart from in scattered macrophages.
There was 1 heart with no iron deposition that had a
mean cardiac LV T2* of 44.4 ± 5.3 ms and a mean LV
iron concentration of 0.38 ± 0.13 mg/g dw. This patient
had died from a stroke with no heart failure. No iron de￾position was seen with Perl’s stain.
Picrosirius red staining for detecting fibrosis
The normal finding of PSR staining of collagen sur￾rounding adventitia of blood vessels in the interstitium
and the division of trabeculae was noted. Overall, the
collagen volume fraction in all hearts was 2.28% ± 1.49%.
No heart with cardiac siderosis had increased overall
CVF (Fig. 3). There was occasional increased PSR stain￾ing at the insertion points of the RV into the LV in the
anteroseptal and inferoseptal areas, which is a non￾specific finding in the adult heart. The atrial PSR stain￾ing showed more prominent interstitial staining than
that in the ventricles, which is also a normal finding
[33]. The valves had prominent PSR staining of the zona
fibrosa, which is a normal layer of collagen in all the
valves. Detailed myocardial PSR quantification is shown
in Tables 2 and 3.
Hearts with fibrosis
Fibrosis above the normal range was demonstrated in
one heart by PSR staining (heart 1) with an overall CVF
of 5.9 ± 2.8%, but this was considered too mild to cause
heart failure. The donor had died from a stroke and had
a long history of atrial fibrillation, but with no cardiac

iron loading (LV T2* 44.4 ± 5.3 ms; mean LV iron con￾centration 0.38 ± 0.13 mg/g dw). The heart weighed
380 g with moderate left ventricular hypertrophy.
Minimal fibrosis was noted in the mid left ventricular
inferoseptal wall and basal anteroseptal wall. Mild patchy
interstitial fibrosis was also seen which was predomin￾antly subepicardial (Fig. 4). Heart 3 also had minor fibro￾sis which in some scattered areas (subepicardial anterior
wall) was above the normal range, but the overall mean
left ventricular CVF was normal at 2.0 ± 1.1%. Severe
iron loading was present, with mean LV T2* of 3.7 ±
0.6 ms, mean LV iron concentration of 9.5 ± 1.9 mg/g
dw and severe granular iron deposition on Perl’s stain.
The heart was small with a weight of 236 g. The donor
had severe heart failure as the cause of death. The level
of fibrosis was considered too minimal to cause heart
failure. There was no evidence of white cell infiltration
to suggest myocarditis.
Discussion
This study failed to show replacement cardiac fibrosis as
a cause of death or transplantation related to heart
failure in patients with transfusion dependent anaemia,
including most importantly beta-thalassaemia major pa￾tients. These findings are in marked contrast to the
major historical pathological series in transfusion
dependent patients. In 1964 [4], post-mortem data pub￾lished by Engle on 41 chronic anemia patients (39 with
thalassemia major, 2 with aplastic anemia), showed 26
(63%) had heart failure with a further 6 (15%) having
cardiac enlargement and an abnormal ECG. These data
clearly indicated that the heart was the target lethal
organ in beta-thalassaemia major. Engle noted that focal
myocyte degeneration and fibrosis was extensive, and
was an “adequate explanation for the progressive cardiac
enlargement and heart failure”. In 1971 [5], Buja re￾ported post-mortem findings on 19 patients with cardiac
iron deposits (8 with aplastic anemia, 4 with chronic my￾elocytic leukemia, 3 with idiopathic hemochromatosis, 2
with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 1 with acute
lymphocytic leukemia, 1 with sickle cell anemia). Heart

failure occurred in 14 (67%) patients. The left ventricle
was affected by extensive myocardial replacement fibro￾sis in 6 (29%) patients and by focal interstitial fibrosis in
4 (21%) patients. The papillary muscles were affected by
focal interstitial fibrosis in a further 6 (29%) patients. In
only 3 patients (14%), was the heart not affected by fi￾brosis. Buja listed a further 21 reports dating from 1933
to 1967 as showing myocardial fibrosis in patients with
cardiac iron loading [5].
The cause of cardiac fibrosis in iron overload condi￾tions is not fully explained. The most important effect
appears to be that myocytes can suppress proliferation
of cardiac fibroblasts by cumulative effects on late G1
events leading to DNA synthesis, and these effects are
diminished with myocyte iron accumulation, which en￾courages cardiac fibrosis [34, 35]. However, a less sup￾porting study of mRNA in ex-vivo cardiac myocytes
showed iron level dependent reductions in expression of
transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-B1), biglycan, and
collagen type I, which was accompanied by a reduction
in TGF-B1 bioactivity, which does not obviously support
iron-driven cardiac fibrogenesis [36]. Animal models
support a link between cardiac iron and cardiac fibrosis.
Cardiac fibrosis was prominent in double knock-out
mice for beta 2 microglobulin (B2m, deficiency of which
causes increased gut uptake of iron through impairment
of the HFE-B2m complex) and recombinase activator
gene 1 (Rag1, deficiency of which causes absence of B
and T lymphocytes) which was not seen in B2m and
Rag1 single-knockout mice or control mice of the same
age, implying that lymphocytes play a role in cardiac fi￾brosis which is additive to cardiac iron loading alone
[37]. Other iron loading animal models also show car￾diac fibrosis, although this was not prominent [38, 39].
The explanation for the apparent change in prevalence
of replacement cardiac fibrosis over 40 years can only be
subject to speculation. One obvious possibility is the
introduction of the iron chelator deferoxamine, which
came into widespread clinical use in the 1970’s. Al￾though not explicitly stated, the patients in Engle and
Buja’s papers would not have received such treatment
based on the period of the patient post-mortems (1950–
1963, and 1953–1969 respectively). This suggests that
deferoxamine might impair the development cardiac fi￾brosis that occurs with myocardial siderosis. This is
plausible as deferoxamine is known to stabilise liver fi￾brosis in association with reduced liver iron loading [40].
There is also experimental evidence which supports this
position. Control of cardiac iron may in itself prevent
cardiac fibrosis by suppressing fibroblast proliferation
[34, 35] but other direct supportive evidence for a pro￾tective effect of deferoxamine comes from studies of
angiotensin II in normal and iron loaded rats in which
the development of cardiac fibrosis could be prevented
by deferoxamine [41]. Since angiotensin II causes cardiac
fibrosis and is increased in cardiac failure, this effect
could be clinically significant. However, this explanation
is not completely sufficient because patients 3 and 4 in
our series, did not receive chelation but did not have sig￾nificant myocardial fibrosis.
Although the use of deferoxamine seems the most
likely factor distinguishing the historical from our mod￾ern cardiac findings, other possibilities exist. Another
change in treatment of thalassemia major patients is the
use of increased numbers of blood transfusions per year
since the 1970’s, which suppresses ineffective erythropoi￾esis and bony abnormality. A typical modern regime for
an adult includes the transfusion of up to 50 units of
blood per year (0.4 mg/kg/day transfusional iron burden)
[42]. Engle documented a transfusion rate on average of
approximately 13.4 units/year in 26 patients who devel￾oped heart failure [4], consistent with a >3 fold increase
in transfusion rate for modern patients. Cardiac fibrosis
could therefore have been stimulated by anemia related
myocardial hypoxia in historical patient cohorts, particu￾larly in the setting of left ventricular hypertrophy and
dilatation [43]. Increased transfusions with improved tis￾sue oxygenation might have played a role therefore in
reducing myocardial fibrosis. The change in cardiac fi￾brosis might also be related to an apparent reduction in
recurrent pericarditis seen in the last 40 years. Engle re￾ported 19 of 41 (46%) patients had 33 recognised epi￾sodes of pericarditis [4]. Pericarditis was not a focus of
Buja’s paper [5]. Pericarditis is recognized in thalassemia
major in the modern era, but at a far lower incidence of
<5% [44]. It is likely that pericarditis is now less frequent
because of the widespread use of iron chelation therapy,
but the genesis of the pericarditis in iron overload is not
well understood and other factors might be important.
Myocarditis is also recognised as a cause of myocardial
fibrosis [45], and has been documented from a modern
series as occurring in 4.5% of beta-thalassemia major pa￾tients [46]. Myocarditis was not documented in the his￾torical series and direct comparisons with the modern
findings are therefore not possible. However, the fact
that the detailed historical papers did not report myocar￾dial inflammation, would not suggest that it was promin￾ent or common, and therefore a reduction in prevalence
seems unlikely. It should be noted that in the modern
environment, approximately 2% of cases of heart failure
in thalassemia major have low levels of cardiac iron [47],
and these are thought to be caused by myocarditis [48],
in which cardiac fibrosis may play a significant role [45],
which is in addition to the myocardial infection and in￾flammation. Another possibility is that a historical factor
in blood transfusion practice was associated with cardiac
fibrosis in the past that has now decreased. The reduced
transmission of cardiotrophic viruses might be a
Kirk et al. Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (2017) 19:36 Page 6 of 9

possibility, of which one candidate virus is hepatitis C,
which has been implicated in myocarditis and cardiac fi￾brosis [49–51]. Reports of infrequent cardiac fibrosis in
beta-thalassemia major using the non-invasive in-vivo
technique of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) CMR
showed infrequent minor fibrosis (24%, 2% and 15.8% of
patients) in patients without heart failure [52–54], but the
extent of fibrosis was limited (3.9%, 0.4%, 1.3%) [52–54].
In comparison to other disease settings it is not clear
whether this minor fibrosis would be sufficient to cause
significant LV dysfunction, where on average each 1% of
infarcted myocardium assessed by LGE leads to only a
modest 0.67% reduction in ejection fraction [55]. How￾ever, the difference in prevalence of minor cardiac fibrosis
between centers might be explained by the different
prevalence of hepatitis C infection [52, 53]. Despite this
possibility however, extensive cardiac fibrosis causing
heart failure is not seen in hepatitis C infection, and it is
unlikely that changes in transfusional infections can ex￾plain the change over time in replacement cardiac fibrosis.
Further possible factors that might influence the
difference in cardiac fibrosis over time are: 1) the oc￾currence of diabetes in thalassaemia major, which has
association with the presence of cardiac fibrosis and
development of heart failure [56]. However, seven of
our 10 patients had confirmed diabetes without sig￾nificant cardiac fibrosis. 2) the use of inhibitors of the
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system such as angio￾tensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin re￾ceptor blockers (ARB) and mineralocorticoid receptor
antagonists (MRA) which are known potent inhibitors
of myocardial fibrosis [57–60]. Only 2 of our patients
were recorded as being on such treatment, although
due to the retrospective nature of data collection in
this series, the accuracy of drug treatments may not
be ideal. 3) Finally, in older transfusion dependent pa￾tients, the pattern of heart failure and the relationship
to cardiac fibrosis may differ in comparison with
younger patients, with development of heart failure
with preserved ejection fraction [61]. This cardiac
pathology is not completely understood but restrictive
physiology is involved.
Limitations
The absence of in-vivo CMR does not allow the com￾parison of late gadolinium enhancement with the
histological findings. The technique of T1 mapping
was likewise not possible in-vivo in this population
[62]. This is inevitable given the international source
of the post-mortem hearts. This was a small study in
comparison with historical reports, which reflects the
general trend towards reduction of patients undergo￾ing post-mortem.
Conclusion
Severe myocardial siderosis causes a toxic dilated cardio￾myopathy which can be reversed if aggressive chelation
is commenced early. In the current study, the direct
histological examination of hearts from patients with
terminal heart failure has shown no significant replace￾ment myocardial fibrosis. This suggests that the cause of
left ventricular impairment seen in cardiac siderosis is a
direct result of myocardial iron toxicity and not due to
fibrosis. The discrepancy of these findings in comparison
with historical reports of extensive fibrosis in cardiac
siderosis is most probably explained by the use of iron
chelation treatment, although other factors may play a
role including increased transfusions.
