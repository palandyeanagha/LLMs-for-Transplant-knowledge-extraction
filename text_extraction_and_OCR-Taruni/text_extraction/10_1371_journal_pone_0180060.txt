Abstract
Background
Sepsis is a serious medical condition with increasing prevalence and high mortality. The
role of the autonomic nervous system in pathophysiology of sepsis has been increasingly
researched. The objective of this study is to evaluate the Heart rate variability (HRV) as a
predictor of mortality in septic patients.
Methods
This was a prospective cohort of patients diagnosed with sepsis. Patient recruitment was
carried out at ICU in tertiary university hospital between March 2012 and February 2014.
Clinical data and laboratory exams were collected at admission. Each patient underwent a
20-minute Holter and a 24-hour Holter on the first day of enrollment. The primary outcome
was the 28-day all-cause mortality.
Results
A total of 63 patients were included. Patients were categorized into nonsurvivor group
(n = 16) or survivor group (n = 47) depending on this endpoint. Survivors were younger
(48.6 years vs. 63.0 years), had better renal function and lower values in severity scores
(APACHE II and SOFA) compared to nonsurvivors. In the 20-minute Holter, SDNN, Total
Power, VLF Power, LF Power and LF/HF of nonsurvivors were significantly lower than
those of survivors (p = <0.001, p = 0.003, p = 0.002, p = 0.006, p = 0.009 respectively). ROC
curve of SDNN was built, showing area under the curve of 0.772 (0.638–0.906) for mortality.
The value of 17ms was chosen as best SDNN cutoff to discriminate survivors and nonsurvi￾vors. In the Cox proportional regression, adjusted for SOFA score and for APACHE II, a
SDNN  17ms was associated with a greater risk of death, with hazard ratios of 6.3 (1.4–
28.0; p = 0.015) and 5.5 (1,2–24,8; p = 0.027), respectively. The addition of the dichoto￾mized SDNN to the SOFA model reduced AIC and increased the concordance statistic and
the R2
, indicating that predictive power of the SDNN + SOFA model is better than predictive
power of SOFA only.

Conclusions
Several HRV parameters are reduced in nonsurviving septic patients. SDNN 17 is a risk
factor for death in septic patients, even after adjusting for severity scores.
Introduction
Sepsis is a serious medical condition which prevalence has increased significantly in recent
decades[1], making 31.5 million new cases to be expected in hospitals around the world each
year[2]. Due to the high mortality associated with this condition, which can reach 48.6%[3], it
is essential to search risk factors for death and predictive scoring systems to help clinical deci￾sion in septic patients. Predictive scoring systems such as APACHE II (Acute Physiology and
Chronic Health disease Classification System II), SOFA (Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assess￾ment), SAPS-3 (Simplified Acute Physiology Score III) and MODS (Multiple Organ Dysfunc￾tion Score) combine clinical and laboratory characteristics to assess the severity of illness.
However, none of these scores considers in its composition changes in the autonomic nervous
modulation caused by sepsis.
Heart rate variability (HRV) is a noninvasive indirect test to evaluate autonomic function
[4, 5]. In normal situations, heart rate varies, indicating the heart’s capacity to adapt to differ￾ent situations. HRV measures the oscillation of the intervals between consecutive heart beats,
which are related to, the influences of the autonomic nervous system on the sinus node[6].
Patients with sepsis have reduced HRV compared to healthy patients, as demonstrated in
small studies[7–9]. Furthermore, HRV parameters such as low frequency (LF) power are posi￾tively correlated with APACHE II and SOFA[10] and negatively correlated with interleukins
[11]. Small studies have suggested that sepsis survivors present HRV parameters (e.g., standard
deviation of NN interval, SDNN) higher than nonsurvivors[12, 13]. However, no study has
defined a specific HRV parameter and a cut-off point that can be used in practice for the pre￾diction of the risk of death in septic patients. Thus, the use of HRV as an independent predic￾tor of death in sepsis deserves further investigation.
The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of HRV—recorded both with the 20
minute and the 24 hour-Holter—as a predictor of death in patients with severe sepsis, defined
by the presence of infection, the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome criteria and evi￾dence of organ dysfunction.
Materials and methods
Study design
This was a prospective cohort of patients diagnosed with severe sepsis. This report follows
"Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology", the STROBE State￾ment[14].
Patient population
Patient recruitment was carried out at one of the Intensive Care Units of Hospital das Clı´nicas
of the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (ICU-UFMG), Brazil, a mixed ICU with eight
beds. From March 10th, 2012 to February 06th, 2014, all adult (i.e., 18 year-old or older)
patients, hospitalized in the ICU-UFMG that had suspicion of sepsis at admission or during
the ICU stay, and at least one organ dysfunction supposedly related to the infectious condition

were considered for potential eligibility. Sepsis was defined according to the Sepsis 2 Consen￾sus[15] as being a Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome associated with a confirmed
infection or strongly suspected infection. Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome was
defined as the presence of at least two of the following: 1- Body temperature higher than 38˚C
or lower than 36˚C; 2- Heart rate higher than 90/min, 3- Hyperventilation evidenced by respi￾ratory rate higher than 20/min or PaCO2 lower than 32 mmHg; 4- White blood cell count
higher than 12,000 cells/μl or lower than 4,000/μl or at least 10% of immature forms [16]. The
presence of at least one organ dysfunction was based on severe sepsis definition of Surviving
Sepsis Campaign[17]. Despite inclusion phase of this study was conducted prior to publication
of the Sepsis 3 definitions[18], all included patients met the criteria for Sepsis proposed in this
consensus.
Exclusion criteria were: moribund patients (death previewed for the next 24 hours), patients
with proposal for exclusive palliative care, septic patients under antibiotic therapy for more
than 48 hours prior to enrollment and patients with non-sinus rhythm or with pacemaker.
Study protocol and general procedures
This study was approved by the Ethics Research Committee of the Universidade Federal de
Minas Gerais, Brazil, and all included patients or their family members signed a written
informed consent. Clinical data was collected at admission and during the clinical follow-up of
patients through a dedicated Clinical Report Form. The main variables collected were: age,
gender, comorbidities, main diagnosis at the time of inclusion, primary site of infection and
microbiological findings, antibiotic used, Sepsis related Organ Failure Assessment score
(SOFA)[19] and Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II)[20], both
evaluated at the time of inclusion.
Heart rate variability analysis
Each patient enrolled in the study underwent a 3-channel Holter (Cardios1 CardioLight
model, São Paulo, Brazil) on the first day of enrollment. Two recordings were made sequen￾tially: 20 minutes record and 24 hours record. Both Holter monitors were placed and removed
from the patients by one of the medical researchers. The first measure (20 minutes record) was
made with the patient in supine position and no intervention (nursing, physiotherapy, etc.)
was made during its recording. The 24-hour measure was made without interference in the
normal ICU care routine. Data analysis to derive HRV was performed using system specifically
developed for this purpose (Cardios1), which automatically calculates the following indices of
HRV in the time domain: Normal-to-Normal (NN) average interval, standard deviation of the
NN interval (SDNN), square root of the squared mean of the difference of successive NN￾intervals (r-MSSD), percentage of NN intervals deviated by more than 50 ms from adjacent
NN-intervals (pNN50); and frequency domain with fast Fourier Transform (FFT) method:
Total Power, Very low frequency power (VLF Power), Low frequency Power (LF Power), High
frequency power (HF Power) and Ratio between LF and HF (LF/HF). In the 24-hour Holter,
HRV analysis was performed only in the time domain. We have performed manual review of
all Holter’s automatic interpretation, including the rhythm and the complexes recorded (e.g.,
normal QRS, ventricular extrasystoles, supraventricular extrasystoles, tachycardia, bradycar￾dia, artifacts etc.). Artifacts and irregular beats (extrasystoles, noise and missing beats) were
manually deleted before HRV analyses. In the 24-hour Holter, HRV in the time domain was
calculated over an entire 24-hour period. In the 20 minutes Holter, HRV was calculated both
in the time domain and in the frequency domain over the entire first 10 minutes of recording.

Outcomes
The primary outcome of this study was the all-cause mortality at 28 days of follow-up. Patients
were categorized into nonsurvivor group or survivor group depending on the primary end￾point. Several HRV parameters were compared between these two groups.
Sample size
The sample size calculation tested the hypothesis that SDNN distribution would be the same
between surviving and nonsurviving patients. The statistical test used was the nonparametric
Mann-Whitney that assumes that the data is measured at least in ordinal scale. The formulas
adopted for sample size calculation are described in Zhao, Rahardja, & Qu[21] and imple￾mented in software R[22]. A pilot sample constituted by the first twenty patients included in
the study (6 deaths and 14 survived) was considered to estimate the parameters required to cal￾culate the final sample size. Tertiles of SDNN were calculated from this pilot sample, defining
three ranges. The proportion of subjects in each of these three ranges was obtained. Keeping
the allocation ratio (i.e., survivors and non survivors) similar to that observed in the pilot
study, a requirement of 58 patients (44 survivors and 14 deaths) was defined for the final analy￾sis. We considered a type I error of 5% and 80% power.
Statistical analysis
The normality of each continuous variable was assessed by means of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test. Data obtained from continuous variables are expressed as either mean and standard devi￾ation if they have normal distribution, or median and interquartile range (25th and 75th per￾centiles) if they have non-normal distribution. Data concerning categorical variables are
expressed as absolute numbers and proportions. Clinical characteristics of survivors and non￾survivors were compared using Student t test, Mann–Whitney test and exact Fisher test
according to the type and the distribution of the variable. In order to choose the best cut-off
point of SDNN, a ROC curve was used having death as the reference and SDNN as the param￾eter test[23]. Then the dichotomized SDNN was used to build Kaplan–Meier survival curves,
and they were compared by log-rank test. The influence of HRV variables on survival was
studied with Cox regression. Considering the small sample, we used modeling strategies to
avoid the risk of overfitting and the excessive “optimism” of the model [24]. The calibration of
the models with only SOFA and with dichotomized SDNN + SOFA was assessed with the the
Grønnesby and Borgan test (GF Test). The performance of those prediction models was
assessed using concordance measure, Explained variation (R2
) and Akaike Information Crite￾rion (AIC). In order to evaluate the reclassification of the SOFA + SDNN model compared to
the SOFA model only, we set the time of 28 days for the predictions of the risks, and calculated
continuous net reclassification improvement (NRI) and integrated discrimination improve￾ment (IDI). A p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all analyses.
All the statistical analyses were conducted in SPSS version 23 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA)
and R version 3.3.0 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing)[22] using the packages rms,
survMisc and survIDINRI.
Results
From a total of 99 patients with sepsis assessed during the study period, 79 patients were ini￾tially identified as eligible. Of these, two patients were excluded because of technical problems
with the Holter equipment and 14 patients were excluded due to atrial fibrillation. Thus, 63
patients were included in the final analyses (Fig 1).

The baseline characteristics of the included patients are shown in Table 1, stratified accord￾ing to the 28-day all-cause mortality. As presented, 16 (25.4) out of the 63 patients died during
the follow-up of 28 days. Survivors were younger (48.6 years vs. 63.0 years), had better renal
function and lower values in severity scores (APACHE II and SOFA) compared to nonsurvi￾vors. There were no significant differences in other baseline characteristics.
HRV measures of each group are listed in Table 2. In 20-minute Holter, SDNN, Total
Power, VHF Power, LF Power and LF/HF of non-survivors were significantly lower than those
of survivors. There was no statistically significant difference in HRV measured in the 24 hours
Holter between the two subgroups.
An unadjusted Cox regression for HRV parameters that were different between the two
groups was built. It can be seen in Table 3. Since SDNN reached the larger difference between
survivors and nonsurvivors, ROC curve was built to evaluate the accuracy of this parameter to
predict the 28-day all-cause-mortality; as depicted in Fig 2, an area under the curve of 0.772
(0.638–0.906) was found. Then, because it presents the best relationship between sensitivity
and specificity, 17ms was chosen as the cutoff point for SDNN. In order to test the possible
clinical application of this cut-off point as a predictor of mortality in sepsis, patients were
divided into two groups (SDNN> 17ms and SDNN17ms). As can be seen in Table 4, there is
no significant difference between the baseline features of these two groups. Kaplan-Meier
curve of these two groups (Fig 2) found log rank p = 0.003, showing higher mortality of the
patient group with SDNN17ms. For the analysis of 28 days mortality, Cox regression for this
dichotomous variable was made adjusted by the SOFA showing HR 6.3 (1.4–28.0; p = 0.015)

for SDNN17ms and HR 1.3 (1.1–1.4; p = 0.001) for SOFA. Following a similar trend, Cox
regression for dichotomous SDNN adjusted by the APACHE II showed HR 5.5 (1.2–24.8;
p = 0.027) for SDNN17ms and HR 1.1 (1.02–1.12; p = 0.004) for APACHE II.
Considering the small sample, we used modeling strategies to avoid the risk of overfitting
and the excessive “optimism”. For the model with SOFA and dichotomous SDNN, optimism

SOFA + SDNN. The addition of the dichotomized SDNN to the SOFA model increased the
concordance statistic from 0.725 to 0.805 and the R2 of the model changed from 0.167 to
0.277. Furthermore, the AIC for the first model [SOFA] was 119.07 versus 112.17 for the sec￾ond [SDNN + SOFA]. Greater values for concordance and R2 indicate a better model while
smaller values for AIC indicate a better model. In order to evaluate the reclassification of the
SOFA + SDNN model compared to the SOFA model only, we set the time of 28 days for the
predictions of the risks, and calculated IDI (0.122; CI 0.043–0.235, p = 0.00) and NRI (0.408;
CI 0.168–0.643, p = 0.01). These results suggest significant gains in the reclassification with the
inclusion of SDNN in the model. All statistical analysis with the dichotomous SDNN can be
seen in the Table 5.

In the survivor group, seven patients had undetermined infection source, while zero
patients had undetermined infection source among the non-survivors. The results regarding
the association of SDNN values and the outcome remained unchanged in the analysis exclud￾ing these seven patients. Thus, SDNN value was significantly higher among survivors as com￾pared to non-survivors, when evaluated in the 20-minute Holter: 18.50 (10.00–34.50) and
8.50 (5.00–14.50), respectively, with p = 0.003. Cox regression for dichotomous SDNN
adjusted by the SOFA or APACHE II revealed similar results (HR 7.1 [1.6–32.8]; p = 0.012, for
SDNN17ms and HR 1.3 [1.1–1.5]; p < 0.001, for SOFA. Following a similar trend, Cox
regression for dichotomous SDNN, adjusted by the APACHE II, showed HR 5.1 (1.1–22.9;
p = 0.033) for SDNN17ms, and HR 1.1 (1.03–1.12; p = 0.001) for APACHE II.
Discussion
In this prospective study with septic patients, we found that several HRV parameters obtained
in the 20-minute Holter were correlated to 28-day all-cause mortality. In particular, SDNN
17 is associated with increased risk of death even after adjustment to SOFA or APACHE II.
In contrast, HRV parameters in 24-hour Holter were not correlated to 28-day all-cause
mortality.
Normal immune and physiologic responses eradicate pathogens through complex pro￾cess involving generation of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators. The

HR = Hazard Ratio; CI = Confidence Interval; R2 = Explained variation; AIC = Akaike Information Criterion. For the analysis of 28 days mortality, Cox
regression for dichotomous SDNN was made adjusted by the SOFA and adjusted by APACHE II. For the model with SOFA and dichotomous SDNN,
optimism was calculated at 0.1075 (and the shrinkage factor was 0.8925). For the model with APACHEII and dichotomous SDNN, optimism was calculated
at 0.1834 (and the shrinkage factor was 0.8166). The calibration of the models with only SOFA and with dichotomized SDNN + SOFA was assessed with
the the GF Test, indicating that there are no calibration problems. The performance of those prediction models was assessed. Greater values for
concordance and R2 indicate a better model while smaller values for AIC indicate a better model. In order to evaluate the reclassification of the SOFA
+ SDNN model compared to the SOFA model only, we calculated IDI (0.122; CI 0.043–0.235, p<0.01) and NRI (0.408; CI 0.168–0.643, p = 0.01). These
results suggest significant gains in the reclassification with the inclusion of SDNN in the model.

pathophysiology of sepsis is due to the inappropriate regulation of these normal reactions
that becomes generalized and deleterious[25]. The role of the autonomic nervous system has
been increasingly studied in the context of sepsis. Animal model studies suggest that vagus
nerve stimulation increases the secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH),
ACTH, and cortisol[26]. Likewise, vagotomy attenuated fever response and corticosterone
response produced by cytokines[27]. Acetylcholine, the principle vagal neurotransmitter,
has an anti-inflammatory effect, attenuating the release of cytokines TNF, IL-1beta, IL-6 and
IL-18 and preventing the development of shock[28]. Treatment with nicotine, a selective
cholinergic agonist, and with choline, a precursor in the biosynthesis of acetylcholine,
improved survival in experimental models of sepsis[29, 30]. This results supports that vagal
afferent pathway are involved in peripheral cytokine-to-brain communication.
Several methods have already been developed to evaluate the autonomic function. Some of
the tests would not be adequate for this study because they require active participation of
patients. This is the case of the Valsalva’s manoeuvre, the deep breathing method, the isometric
handgrip test, the mental arithmetic, and the active standing methods [31]. Other methods
require infusion of drugs (e.g. baroreflex sensitivity testing with intravenous administration of
phenylephrine), which could interfere in the treatment of patients with sepsis, making its use
unfeasible and potentially harmful[31]. The serum catecholamines dosage can be used to eval￾uate the autonomic nervous system; however it has some limitations, providing information
about the global autonomic function and not about organ-specific sympathetic function[32].
Additionally, the plasma concentration of norepinephrine, for example, depends not only on
sympathetic activity, but also on norepinephrine reuptake and noradrenaline clearance from
circulation [33]. Finally, patients with septic shock often receive external noradrenaline infu￾sion as treatment. HRV is one of the most popular methods used to evaluate the autonomic
function, presenting the advantages of being non-invasive and the fact that there are many
commercial devices that provide the automated measurement of HRV[4].
The mechanism by which HRV is reduced in septic patients is not yet fully understood. In
addition to the participation of the autonomic nervous system, recent studies in animals and
cell cultures have shown that Lipopolysaccharides (amphiphilic components of the outer wall
of Gram-negative bacteria) act in two ways on the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleo￾tide-gated channel 2 (HCN) of the atrial cells: directly inhibiting HCN-channels and indirectly
sensitizing HCN-channels for sympathetic activation[34, 35].
Although there are no reference ranges of HRV parameters globally accepted, this study
suggests that septic patients have reduced HRV compared to the general population. For
example, in this study, the SDNN mean for surviving patients were 19.0ms and for nunsurviv￾ing patients were 8.5ms, while Kim et al found SDNN mean of 39.6ms for normal Korean Pop￾ulation[36].
The physiological meaning of each HRV parameter is very complex and not fully known.
SDNN reflects all the cyclic components responsible for HRV (including sympathetic and
parasympathetic activity) and is the most commonly used parameter[4]. HF Power reflects the
vagal activity (parasympathetic) on the sinus node[37]. LF Power reflects the sympathetic and
parasympathetic activity, with alleged predominance of the first [38]. The LF/HF ratio, in
HRV, was classically described as an index of the sympathetic/parasympathetic balance[38].
However, several studies have shown that this interpretation is imprecise and simplistic and
that the physiological meaning of this ratio remains controversial[39]. A reduced LF/HF ratio
is associated with an increased risk of death in septic patients[40]. In this study, nonsurviving
patients had lower Total Power, VLF Power, LF Power and LF / HF ratio than survivors. This
finding is similar to that found in previous research[10, 12, 41].

Unlike the study by Duke et al.[13], in ours, HRV parameters were significantly different
between survivors and nonsurvivors only in the 20-minute Holter. Holter with shorter periods
of record is potentially more useful for be used in critical care patients, including those with
sepsis, because these patients present immediate risk of death and therefore need a fast tool for
definition of severity. Moreover, in such a dynamic condition as sepsis, a long time recording
may suffer interference from therapeutic measures instituted, which can partially explain the
negative results found with the 24-hour Holter in this study.
Global HRV parameters such as SDNN and TP were lower in nonsurviving patients of
this study, which is consistent with the findings of previous studies[12, 13]. Chen et al[12]
had demonstrated that SDNN would be a significant independent variable in the prediction
of in-hospital mortality for emergency department patients with sepsis, although these
authors did not present cut-off point for this HRV parameter. The cut-off of 17ms for
SDNN obtained in a short time Holter record found in our study of might represent a useful
tool due to identify patients with higher risk of death among septic patients in the daily
practice. It worth mentioning that this result was maintained after adjustment for APACHE
II or SOFA, indicating that this value could be an independent risk factor for mortality.
Although the results found in the present study are statistically significant, the fact that the
confidence intervals on the hazard ratio for SDNN are large reflect the small number of
patients in our study, which indicates the need of confirming these results in larger series of
septic patients.
Furthermore, concordance measure, R2
, AIC, IDI and NRIindicate that predictive power of
the SDNN + SOFA model is better than predictive power of SOFA only, which reinforces the
possible clinical utility of this measure.
Study limitations
The small number of patients is the main limitation of this study. In order to minimize this
problem, it was used advanced modeling techniques to avoid the risk of overfitting and also to
adjust the coefficients for optimism. This analysis kept SDNN 17 as a risk factor for death for
the model with SOFA but not for the model with APACHE II. Another limitation of this study
is the possible influence of other clinical conditions known to affect HRV as congestive heart
failure, coronary artery disease, diabetes or mechanical ventilation use[4]. However, there was
no difference between nonsurvivor and survivor groups about the frequency of these comor￾bidities (Table 1). Body temperature and medications (e.g., sedatives, beta-blockers, inotropic
drugs) that can affect HRV were not evaluated in this study. Day-night variation in heart rate
variability was not considered in the design of this study, although its existence has already
been demonstrated in healthy volunteers with endotoxaemia[42]. The majority of 20-minute
Holter measures were made during the day, and there were no significant differences between
the percentage of day recordings from surviving and non-surviving groups. Furthermore, we
do not know whether this day-night difference occurs in ICU patients. Finally, all included
patients were enrolled before the publication of the Sepsis 3 Consensus[18], reason for which
we were not able to use the new definitions of sepsis in the present study. Despite this, all
patients included in this study had a SOFA score  2 points and met criteria for Sepsis based
on this new consensus in a post hoc analysis.
Considering the small number of patients in this single-center study, we believe that the
results found here are preliminary, hinting at the potential predictive capability of a dichoto￾mized SDNN, what should be confirmed in future studies through external validation of the
results in a separate population.

Conclusions
Several HRV parameters are reduced in nonsurviving septic patients. Although further studies
are necessary to confirm this finding, SDNN 17 is suggested as an independent risk factor
for death in septic patients.
