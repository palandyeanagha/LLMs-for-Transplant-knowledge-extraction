Background: In hepatic ischaemia/reperfusion injury, activated liver macrophages (Kupffer cells) are
dominantly regulated by a transcription factor, nuclear factor kB (NFkB), with respect to expression of
inflammatory cytokines, acute phase response proteins, and cell adhesion molecules.
Aims: We assessed whether inactivation of NFkB in the liver could attenuate total hepatic warm
ischaemia/reperfusion injury.
Methods: We studied rats with hepatic overexpression of inhibitor kBa super-repressor (IkBa SR) caused
by a transgene introduced using an adenoviral vector. Hepatic ischaemia/reperfusion injury was induced
under warm conditions by total occlusion of hepatoduodenal ligament structures for 20 minutes, followed
by reperfusion. Controls included uninfected and control virus (AdLacZ) infected rats.
Results: IkBa SR was overexpressed in Kupffer cells as well as in hepatocytes, blocking nuclear
translocation of NFkB (p65) into the nucleus after reperfusion. Gene transfection with IkBa SR, but not with
LacZ, markedly attenuated ischaemia/reperfusion injury, suppressing inducible nitric oxide synthase and
nitrotyrosine expression in the liver. Moreover, no remarkable hepatocyte apoptosis was detected under
IkBa SR overexpression.
Conclusions: Adenoviral transfer of the IkBa SR gene in the liver ameliorates short term warm ischaemia/
reperfusion injury, possibly through attenuation of hepatic macrophage activation.
Warm hepatic ischaemia/reperfusion injury often
occurs during certain surgical manipulations, such
as when Pringle’s manoeuvre is performed to reduce
blood loss during tumour resection.1 Relatively brief ischae￾mia primes cells for damage, but cell injury may occur after
the ischaemic liver is reperfused.2 After reperfusion, reactive
oxygen species (ROS) play a critical role in inducing
inflammatory responses and cellular damage.3 4 Inflamma￾tion, including ongoing neutrophil recruitment and micro￾circulatory disturbance, further accelerates cellular damage to
result in necrotic cell death.5 6
Kupffer cells, the resident macrophages of the liver, are
activated after ischaemia/reperfusion stress, and have been
recognised to produce ROS, proinflammatory cytokines,
chemokines, and other mediators.5 7 Pharmacological inacti￾vation of Kupffer cells has been reported to suppress hepatic
ischaemia/reperfusion injury, suggesting pathogenetic invol￾vement of these macrophages.8–10 A transcription factor,
nuclear factor kB (NFkB), has been determined to be crucial
in the cascade bringing about Kupffer cell activation.11–13 ROS
produced by Kupffer cells have been proposed to activate
DNA binding activity of NFkB in these cells,14–16 although
such activation of NFkB by ROS remains controversial.17
Moreover, stimulation of Kupffer cells with endotoxin, which
may participate in total ischaemia/reperfusion injury of the
liver, leads to increased DNA binding of NFkB through the
Toll-like receptor 4, myeloid differentiation factor 88, and
interleukin 1 receptor associated kinases.18–20 Thus inactiva￾tion of NFkB in Kupffer cells might be of clinical value
in blocking injurious events in total hepatic ischaemia/
reperfusion.
Several recent studies have proposed that apoptotic cell
death may affect both hepatocytes and sinusoidal endothelial
cells after either warm or cold ischaemia/reperfusion.21–23
Through release of tumour necrosis factor a (TNF-a),
Kupffer cells and platelets reportedly induce apoptosis in
these target cells.24 However, some reports have indicated
that apoptosis in such cells never involves more than 2% of
liver cells when strict morphological criteria for apoptosis are
employed.25 NFkB participates importantly in promoting cell
survival by regulating several antiapoptotic factors, including
inhibitors of apoptosis.26 27 Inactivation of NFkB resulting
from overexpression of inhibitor kBa super-repressor (IkBa
SR) renders hepatocytes susceptible to various proapoptotic
stimuli.28–31 Such blockade of NFkB activity in hepatocytes
could lead to massive cell death after hepatic ischaemia/
reperfusion if the dominant mechanism of cell death after
reperfusion is apoptosis.
In the present study, we overexpressed dominant negative
IkBa SR in the liver using an adenoviral vector (Ad5IkB)
capable of transfecting both hepatocytes and Kupffer cells.
We examined whether the consequent blockade of NFkB
DNA binding activity in the liver protected against or
accelerated short term warm total ischaemia/reperfusion
injury. We employed a rat model of total hepatic ischaemia/
reperfusion that closely simulated a common surgical context
of such injury (Pringle’s manoeuvre). We note that the model
may not be suitable for study of pure hepatic ischaemia/
reperfusion injury as endotoxin translocation from the
congested intestine could occur during the ischaemic period.

of human IkB (IkBa S32A/S36A) was generated as reported
elsewhere.31 Ad5LacZ, encoding the Escherichia coli b-galacto￾sidase gene, was used as a control adenovirus. Adenoviral
stock was amplified in HEK293 cells (CRL1573.ATCC;
Manassas, Virginia, USA) and purified by double caesium
gradient, as described previously, and plaque tittered.31
HEK293 cells were incubated in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal
bovine serum (Dainippon Pharmaceutical, Japan) and
penicillin (100 IU/ml)/streptomycin (100 mg/ml) (Meiji
Seika, Japan) at 37˚C. When the cells reached confluence
they were infected with Ad5IkB or Ad5LacZ at a multipli￾city of infection of 200 for 48–72 hours in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium with 5% fetal bovine serum.
Adenoviruses were dialysed in 1000 ml of dialysis buffer
(phosphate buffered saline 10% glycerol) overnight at 4˚C
before use.
Animal protocols and hepatic ischaemia/reperfusion
procedure
All animals were handled according to the method approved
under the institutional guidelines outlined in the Guide for
Use and Care of Laboratory Animals of Kyoto University
Graduate School of Medicine. Male Sprague-Dawley rats
with a starting weight of 240,255 g (7–8 weeks old) were
used. Recombinant adenoviruses were administered through
their tail veins in a volume of 250 ml (56109 pfu/body) with
27 G needles. No viruses were injected in uninfected control
rats.
Seventy two hours after infection, rats were anaesthetised
by intraperitoneal injection of 0.1 ml/g Nembutal (pentobar￾bital sodium 50 mg/ml; Dainippon Pharmaceutical). After
laparotomy, whole hepatic ischaemia was induced clamping
the hepatic artery, portal vein, and bile duct for 20 minutes
without any decompression of the splanchnic circulation,
resembling a clinical situation (Pringle’s manoeuvre). After
20 minutes, these vessels were unclamped leading to
reperfusion of the liver. This model is sublethal and exhibits
less liver injury compared with that previously published.32 33
Because adenoviral infection per se possibly induces transient
liver injury due to its immunogeneity, we performed the
ischaemia/reperfusion procedure at 72 hours when transient
liver injury induced by adenovirus should have returned to
near normal.
Small amounts of blood (0.4 ml) were collected from the
inferior vena cava at 10 and 40 minutes after reperfusion,
and liver tissues and blood samples were taken when the
animals were sacrificed at 180 minutes. In some rats, liver
tissues and blood samples were collected at 12 or 24 hours
after reperfusion when the animals were sacrificed. At least
four rats in each group were analysed at each time point.
Serum separated from these samples was used for enzymatic
measurement of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine
aminotransferase (ALT), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).
Serum concentration of TNF-a in each animal was also
measured by means of an ELISA kit (Genzyme, Cambridge,
Massachusetts, USA). Samples of the liver were snap frozen
in liquid nitrogen or mounted in Tissue Tec (Sakura
Finetechnical Co., Tokyo, Japan) and stored at 280˚C for
immunohistochemistry. Some of the tissues were fixed in
10% buffered formalin for subsequent histological analysis
(haematoxylin-eosin staining).
Histological assessment
Liver injury was accessed using liver specimens stained with
haematoxylin-eosin. The extent of sinusoidal conges￾tion, cytoplasmic vacuolisation, and liver necrosis was
semiquantitatively assessed, respectively, according to a
scoring criteria previously published.34 Namely, congestion
and vacuolisation were evaluated as follows: none = 0,
minimal = 1, mild = 2, moderate = 3, and severe = 4. Liver
necrosis was scored as follows: none = 0, single cell necro￾sis = 1, up to 30% lobular necrosis = 2, up to 60% lobular
necrosis = 3, and more than 60% lobular necrosis = 4. Scoring
was performed in five independent high power fields on each
sample, and mean values were represented. Blind analysis
was performed on all samples. Infiltration of neutrophils into
the liver was also estimated by means of naphthol AS-D
chloroacetate esterase staining.35 The number of esterase
positive polymorphonuclear cells was counted in 10 high
power fields (6400) in each sample, and mean values were
calculated.
X-gal staining analysis and immunofluorescence
Efficiency of gene transfer after adenoviral infection was
assessed with X-gal staining of liver tissues from rats infected
with Ad5LacZ at 72 hours. Frozen sections from the liver
were evaluated for b-galactosidase activity by incubation
in X-gal solution (3.3 mM K4Fe(CN)6?3H2O, 3.3 mM
K3Fe(CN)6, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.2%X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-
indolyl-b-D-galactopyranoside); Roche Diagnostics, Switzer￾land).
To access whether liver macrophages were transfected with
Ad5LacZ more accurately, immunofluorescent staining
against b-galactosidase and surface antigen of macrophages
was performed. Frozen liver samples were cut into cryostat
sections 5 mm in thickness, and fixed in acetone for
10 minutes. After washing with phosphate buffered saline,
sections were incubated with mouse antisurface antigen of
macrophages monoclonal antibody (ED-1, 1: 100 dilution;
Chemicon International, Temecula, California, USA) and
rabbit anti-b-galactosidase polyclonal antibody (1:200; ICN
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Aurora, Ohio, USA) for 60 minutes.
Slides were washed with phosphate buffered saline and
then incubated for 30 minutes with FITC conjugated goat
antimouse IgG (1:50 dilution; Southern Biotechnology
Associates, Inc., Birmingham, UK) and Texas red conjugated
goat antirabbit IgG. (1: 50 dilution; Southern Biotechnology
Associates, Inc.). Localisation of b-galactosidase and liver
tissue macrophages, and Kupffer cells was analysed using a
confocal laser scanning microscope LSM510 (Carl Zeiss, Jena,
Germany).
Western blot analysis for IkBa and iNOS
Rats were infected with Ad5IkB (2.56109 pfu/body) for
72 hours. Expression of dominant negative IkB protein was
assessed in 20 mg of whole liver homogenates using rabbit
anti-IkBa antibody (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, California, USA). Equal amounts of lysates were
electrophoresed on 15% sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacryl￾amide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene
difluoride membrane. After blocking, the membrane was
incubated with the first antibody at 4˚C overnight and then
with the horseradish peroxidase linked goat antirabbit
secondary antibody at 1:1000 dilution (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). Chemiluminescence was detected with an
ECL kit, as previously described. Equal protein loading was
confirmed by staining the gels with the Coomasie stain
solution (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, California, USA).
For western blot of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS),
rabbit anti-iNOS antibody (1:1000 dilution; sc-8310, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) was used, and subsequent procedures
were performed as described above.

4-HNE, and nitrotyrosine

HCl, pH 7.6. After blocking of endogenous peroxidase with
peroxidase blocking agent, sections were incubated for
60 minutes at 37˚C with goat polyclonal antibody against
NFkB p65 (1:100 dilution; c-20:sc-372G; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). After being washed, sections were incubated
for 60 minutes with biotin conjugated rabbit antibody
against goat (1:200 dilution; AP106-b; Chemicon) labelled
with peroxidase streptavidin and examined, after being
incubated with chromogen conjugated DAB substrate for
90 seconds.
For detecting the HA tagged IkBa, mouse monoclonal anti￾HA antibody (5 ml/ml, clone 12CA5; Boehringer Mannheim,
Indianapolis, Indiana, USA) was used as the primary anti￾body, and sections were stained as described above.
Expression of nitrotyrosine and 4-hydroxy-29-nonenal
(HNE) adducts in the liver were analysed by immuno￾histochemistry using polyclonal antinitrotyrosine antibody
(AB5411, 1:100; Chemicon) and monoclonal anti-4-HNE
antibody (JaICA, MHN-20, 1:5; Shizuoka, Japan) as the
primary antibody, respectively.
Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT￾PCR) assay for TNF-a
Messenger RNA was extracted from frozen liver tissue with a
mRNA purification kit (Amersham Biosciences Corp.,
Piscataway, New Jersey, USA). The concentration of mRNA
was ascertained by UV spectrophotometer at 260 nm and
10 mg of mRNA were used to synthesise first strand cDNA
with the First Strand cDNA kit (Amersham Pharmacia). Rat
TNF-a was amplified using the primer pair (each 100 mM, Bp,
59-CAC GCT CTT CTG TCT ACT GA-39, forward; 59-GGA CTC
CGT GAT GTC TAA GT-39, reverse) in a 50 ml PCR reaction
containing 1.5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris HCl,
pH 8.3, and 1.4 ml deoxynucleotides (10 mM each) using 3 ml
cDNA template. Dilutions of cDNA were amplified for 30
cycles at 94˚C for 20 seconds, 56˚C for 60 seconds, and 72˚C
for 60 seconds. b-Actin probe was used as the integrity
control, using the primers synthesised from conserved coding
sequences (265 bp, 59-TCC TAT GTG GGT GAC GAG GC-39,
forward; 59-TAC ATG GCT GGG GTG TTG AA-39, reverse).
PCR products were electrophoresed on 2% agarose gel,
stained with ethidium bromide, and visualised under UV
transillumination.
Gel mobility shift assay for NFkB
For the gel mobility shift assay for NFkB binding activity,
nuclear extracted protein was collected as described
elsewhere.33 Double stranded NFkB specific oligodeoxy￾nucleotide probe containing two tandemly positioned NFkB
binding sites (GGG ATT TCC C) were labelled with [a￾32P]
dCTP by Klenow fragment. Nuclear extract (3 mg) was
incubated with a 300 fmol probe in a total of 25 ml of
binding buffer (10 nM HEPES,3 50 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA,
5 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, and 2 mg of poly-dIdC) for
20 minutes at room temperature. For the competition assay,
a 50-fold molar excess of unlabelled oligodeoxynucleotide
probe was added to nuclear extract for 15 minutes before
addition of the labelled probe. The supershift assay was
performed by preincubating with 1 mg of anti-p65 or anti-p50
antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) for 60 minutes at
4˚C before addition of the labelled probe. After incubation,
samples were fractionated on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in
25 mM Tris Cl (pH 8.5), 190 mM glycine, and 1 mM EDTA.
The gel was subsequently dried and visualised by auto￾radiography.
In situ detection of apoptosis
Formalin fixed paraffin embedded liver sections (5 mm) were
deparaffinised in xylene and rehydrated through graded
ethanols. After blocking of endogenous peroxidase with
peroxidase blocking agent, sections were incubated with
protease K (20 mg/ml) for 10 minutes. Then, sections were
incubated with a goat anti-single strand DNA polyclonal
antibody (1:400 dilution; A4506; Dako Cytomation, Kyoto,
Japan), which detects apoptotic cells in situ, for 60 minutes
at room temperature. After being washed, sections were
incubated for 30 minuets with biotin conjugated rabbit
antibody against goat (1:200 dilution; AP106-b; Chemicon)
labelled with peroxidase streptavidin, and with chromogen
conjugated DAB substrate for 90 seconds. Counterstaining
was performed with methyl green.
Statistical analyses
Data are expressed as means (SD), and the statistical
significance of differences among groups was assessed by
the Student’s t test or Mann-Whitney test, as appropriate. A
p value less than 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant.

RESULTS
Efficiency and targets of adenoviral gene transfer in
vivo
Efficiency of adenoviral gene transfer in vivo was determined
by western blotting with antibodies against IkBa and
immunostaining of HA tagged IkBa SR or b-galactosidase.
As reported previously, western blotting using anti-IkBa
antibody demonstrated high expression of HA tagged IkBa
S32A/S36A only in liver homogenates from Ad5IkB infected
rats, not those from uninfected or Ad5LacZ infected rats
(fig 1A). Immunohistochemistry using anti-HA antibody
directed against HA tagged IkBa SR demonstrated that more
than 80% of liver cells expressed IkBa SR (fig 1B, C). This
efficiency was similar to that of Ad5LacZ, which was
determined by X-gal staining (data not shown). More
detailed morphological analysis revealed that non-parenchy￾mal cells of the liver as well as hepatocytes were expressing
IkBa SR (fig 1C, arrowheads). To further determine whether
liver macrophages were infected with recombinant adeno￾viral vectors, immunofluorescent analysis of frozen liver
tissues was carried out. Immunofluorescence against
b-galactosidase and macrophage specific surface antigen
revealed that approximately 60% of liver macrophages as
well as about 80% of hepatocytes were immunoreactive for
b-galactosidase (fig 1D–F). Only a few sinusoidal endothelial
cells or hepatic stellate cells were reactive for b-galactosidase
according to immunofluorescence using an antirat platelet
endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 monoclonal antibody or
a rabbit antirat desmin polyclonal antibody (data not
shown).
Attenuation of short term warm ischaemia/
reperfusion injury in the liver by IkBa SR
In the present study, all rats in each group survived after
reperfusion, possibly reflecting the short term nature of
ischaemia. At 180 minutes after reperfusion, histological
examination of uninfected and Ad5LacZ infected liver tissues
demonstrated ballooning, and to some extent necrosis, of
hepatocytes; these findings were most evident around the
central veins (fig 2A, B). Inactivation of NFkB in the liver by
overexpression of IkBa SR markedly attenuated these post
reperfusion histological changes (fig 2C). Semiquantitative
scores for sinusoidal congestion, cytoplasmic vacuolisation,
and hepatocytic necrosis at three hours were 1.4 (0.5), 1.1
(0.4), and 1.2 (0.5) (mean (SD)) in uninfected rats, and 1.7
(0.7), 1.3 (0.5), and 1.3 (0.6) in Ad5LacZ infected animals,
respectively; these scores were 0.4 (0.5), 0.6 (0.6), and 0.4
(0.5) (mean (SD)) in Ad5IkB infected rats, all showing
significant attenuation (p,0.05). Serum concentrations of
AST, ALT, and LDH gradually increased in uninfected and
Ad5LacZ infected groups and then returned to near normal
values by 24 hours. No significant differences in serum
concentrations of these liver enzymes were observed between
these two groups (fig 2D–F). The transient increases in serum
AST, ALT, and LDH were significantly attenuated in Ad5IkB
infected rats at various time points. These results indicate
that inactivation of NFkB in the liver by adenoviral gene
transfer of IkBa SR could ameliorate short term warm
ischaemia/reperfusion injury.
Inhibition of nuclear translocation of NFkB and its
DNA binding activity in the liver after I/R by
transduction of IkBa SR
Immunohistochemistry for NFkB (p65) revealed that p65 had
translocated to the nucleus in hepatocytes as well as in non￾parenchymal liver cells (NPC) at three hours after reperfusion
in uninfected or Ad5LacZ infected rats (fig 3A, B). Adenoviral
gene transfer of IkBa SR markedly suppressed this nuclear
translocation of p65 in hepatocytes as well as in NPC (fig 3C).
The percentage of NPC in which nuclear translocation of
NFkB was detected was 85% in uninfected, 87% in Ad5LacZ
infected, and 15% in Ad5IkB infected livers. Transgenes of
LacZ or IkBa SR had no effect on distribution of p65 in the
liver before ischaemia/reperfusion (data not shown). The gel

uninfected (A), Ad5LacZ infected (B), and Ad5IkB infected (C) rats 180 minutes after ischaemia/reperfusion. Necrosis in hepatocytes around central
veins and infiltration of inflammatory cells, which were observed in uninfected and Ad5LacZ infected rats, were almost totally blocked in Ad5IkB
infected animals. Each picture is representative of six individual animals in each group. Serum (s) aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (D), alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) (E), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (F) levels were measured in uninfected, Ad5LacZ infected, and Ad5IkB infected rats at
each time point indicated (n = 6 respectively). After reperfusion, the increase in AST, ALT, and LDH in Ad5IkB infected animals was significantly lower
than those in uninfected and Ad5LacZ infected animals at the indicated times (*p,0.05).

mobility shift assay for NFkB demonstrated that gene
transfer of IkBa SR dramatically suppressed DNA binding
activity of NFkB after ischaemia/reperfusion while its DNA
binding activity had increased markedly at three hours after
reperfusion in uninfected or Ad5LacZ infected liver (fig 3D).
We also analysed mRNA and protein expression of TNF-a
and protein expression of inducible NOS (iNOS), whose
genes are a target for NFkB, in the liver after reperfusion.
TNF-a mRNA was barely detected in uninjured normal livers
while its expression was markedly increased after reperfusion
in uninfected and Ad5LacZ infected livers (fig 3E, lanes 2–4).
Overexpression of IkBa SR in the liver clearly blocked this
increase even after reperfusion (fig 3E, lane 5). Serum
concentrations of TNF-a at three hours after reperfusion,
which were determined by ELISA, were similar to those of
mRNA (fig 3F). Protein expression of iNOS markedly
increased after reperfusion in uninfected and Ad5LacZ
infected livers while IkBa SR dramatically suppressed iNOS
expression following reperfusion (fig 3F). These data suggest
that transfer of IkBa SR effectively suppresses NFkB
activation after reperfusion in non-parenchymal hepatic cells
as well as in hepatocytes.
Attenuation of neutrophil infiltration into the liver by
IkBa SR
Infiltration of neutrophils, which play pivotal roles in
inflammatory injury, was assessed in the liver by naphthol
AS-D chloroacetate esterase staining. The number of infil￾trating neutrophils obviously increased after reperfusion
(three hours) in uninfected and Ad5LacZ infected livers
(fig 4A, B) while that in Ad5IkBa SR infected rats was not
prominent, even after reperfusion (fig 4C). This effect was
confirmed by counting esterase positive polymorphonuclear
cells under microscopic high power fields (fig 4D).
Lack of attenuation by IkBa SR of lipid peroxidation
after reperfusion
As a marker of lipid peroxidation resulting from oxidative
stress in the liver after reperfusion, we used immunohisto￾chemistry to detect HNE adducts in liver tissues. HNE
adducts were not demonstrated in untreated normal rat
livers (fig 4E) while significant amounts of HNE adducts
were detected after reperfusion in untreated, Ad5LacZ
infected, and Ad5IkB infected livers, particularly surrounding
central veins (fig 4F–H). No difference in the distribution
pattern of HNE adducts in the liver was observed between
these three groups. These data indicate that inactivation of
NFkB in the liver did not block lipid peroxidation by
oxidative stress after ischaemia/reperfusion.
Blockade of nitrotyrosine production after reperfusion
by overexpressed IkBa SR
We assessed tyrosine nitration, an index of nitrosylation of
proteins by peroxynitrite and/or other free radicals,
because iNOS expression was affected after reperfusion.
Interestingly, nitrotyrosine adducts were detected pre￾ferentially along the sinusoidal area but not in hepatocytes,
after short term ischaemia/reperfusion in uninfected and
Figure 3 Uninfected (A), Ad5LacZ infected (B), and Ad5IkB infected (C) livers with ischaemia/reperfusion (6400) underwent immunohistochemical
staining of nuclear factor kB (NFkB) p65. After reperfusion, a large number of nuclei were stained with the antibody in uninfected (A) and Ad5LacZ
infected (B) livers. In Ad5IkB induced livers, only a small number of positive nuclei were detected (C). High power views showed that a large number of
nuclei in non-parenchymal liver cells (NPCs, white arrowheads) as well as in hepatocytes were positive for p65 in uninfected (A, inset) and Ad5LacZ
infected (B, inset) livers. In contrast, in the Ad5IkB infected liver, the nuclei of approximately 85% of hepatocytes were negative for p65 staining and
only about 15% of NPCs were positive for p65 (C, inset). Black arrowheads indicate nucleus of NPCs, which were negative for p65. (D) Gel shift assay
for NFkB. Nuclear extracts from fresh liver samples were assayed for NFkB DNA binding activity by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using a
radiolabelled consensus NFkB site probe, as described in materials and methods. A 50-fold cold competitor was added to lane 10. Antibodies against
p65 (RelA) or p50 were used for the supershift assay, respectively (a-p65 lanes 2, 5, and 8; a-p50 lanes 3, 6, and 9). Data are representative of three
separate experiments. (E) Messenger RNA expression of tumour necrosis factor a (TNF-a). After reperfusion, expression of TNF-a mRNA was strongly

suppressed. Results are representative of three separate experiments. cDNA taken from rat liver injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (10 mg/kg) for

Ad5LacZ infected livers (fig 5A, B). This increase in nitro￾tyrosine expression along sinusoids was dramatically sup￾pressed in Ad5IkB infected livers, suggesting that IkBa SR
attenuated ischaemia/reperfusion injury through blockade of
nitric oxide production by non-parenchymal hepatic cells
(fig 5C).
Suppression by IkBa SR of non-parenchymal cell
apoptosis after reperfusion
As the appearance of apoptotic cells in hepatic ischaemia/
reperfusion injury remains controversial, we assessed apop￾tosis in the liver after reperfusion in our model. Using an
antibody against single stranded DNA (ssDNA), a relatively
small number of apoptotic cells were detected along the
sinusoidal area at three hours after reperfusion in uninfected
and Ad5LacZ infected livers, while occasionally apoptosis was
also detected among hepatocytes (fig 5D, E). Gene transfer of
IkBa SR suppressed the appearance of ssDNA positive cells
after reperfusion (fig 5F), even though over 80% of
hepatocytes were transfected with Ad5IkB according to
anti-HA immunostaining (fig 1B, C). Immunohistological
analysis at 12 hours after reperfusion detected ssDNA in a
few non-parenchymal cells, but not in hepatocytes, even in
uninfected and Ad5LacZ infected livers (data not shown).
These data suggest that proapoptotic signalling is not the
main cause of reperfusion injury, at least after reperfusion
following short term warm ischaemia.
DISCUSSION
In pathogenetic sequences underlying hepatic ischaemia/
reperfusion injury, activated liver macrophages (Kupffer
cells) have been assigned critical roles.5–7 During the cascade
leading to activation of Kupffer cells, DNA binding activity of
NFkB, a key regulator of genes encoding inflammatory
cytokines, acute phase response proteins, and cell adhesion
molecules,36 37 is upregulated through several mechanisms,
including pathways dependent on oxidative stress or endo￾toxin.14–16 18 In the present study, we demonstrated that
inactivation of NFkB in the liver using adenoviral gene
transfer of IkBa SR effectively blocked a short term warm
ischaemia/reperfusion injury that was transient and sub￾lethal, showing a good resemblance to liver injury observed
clinically after an intraoperative manipulation, Pringle’s
manoeuvre.
Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that the
adenoviral gene transfer method used in the present study
(dose 56109 pfu/rat) successfully delivered LacZ or IkBa
SR into both parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells,

number of ssDNA containing nuclei were detected along the sinusoidal area at three hours after reperfusion in uninfected (D) and Ad5LacZ infected (E)
livers, while occasionally such nuclei were also detected among hepatocytes. Gene transfer of IkBa SR suppressed the appearance of ssDNA containing
cells after reperfusion (F) (6200). Each picture is representative of six individual animals in each group.

particularly Kupffer cells (fig 1B–F). Overexpressed IkBa SR
effectively blocked nuclear translocation of NFkB (p65) in
both cell types after reperfusion (fig 3C), abolishing increased
p65 DNA binding activity that was observed in uninfected or
Ad5LacZ infected rats (fig 3D). This effect resulted in marked
suppression of genes whose expression is regulated by NFkB,
such as TNF-a and iNOS, even after reperfusion (fig 3E–G).
Considering that a variety of inflammatory cytokines
regulated by NFkB are produced predominantly by non￾parenchymal cells in the liver,11 16 our results suggest that
inactivation of Kupffer cells through blocking NFkB from
DNA binding is possibly the major mechanism underlying the
protective effect of IkBa SR observed in the present study.
Among potential mechanisms contributing to hepatic
ischaemia/reperfusion injury,6 formation of ROS and reactive
nitrogen species after reperfusion has been recognised as a
critical factor.3 4 38 39 Generally, SOD scavenges superoxide to
form oxygen and hydrogen peroxide, which is further
detoxified via catalase to produce water and oxygen. An
excessive amount of hydrogen peroxide, however, can
undergo a one electron reduction with Fe (II) to form Fe
(III) and the highly toxic hydroxyl radical, a very reactive
species that rapidly induces lipid peroxidation.40 In the
present study, inactivation of NFkB in parenchymal and
non-parenchymal hepatic cells did not affect lipid peroxida￾tion after reperfusion (fig 4E–H). This lipid peroxidation after
reperfusion possibly accounts for the incomplete nature of
suppression of transient increases in serum AST, ALT, and
LDH in Ad5IkB infected livers (fig 2D to F), even though they
appeared nearly intact by haematoxylin-eosin staining
(fig 2C).
Nitric oxide is another bioregulatory molecule produced in
the liver after reperfusion; production involves upregulated
expression of iNOS which has been implicated in the
pathogenesis of ischaemia/reperfusion injury.6 38 While nitric
oxide can directly affect cell signalling, it also forms
peroxynitrite, a highly reactive nitrogen species produced by
reaction with ROS that carries out nitration of tyrosine
residues in proteins. In the present study, iNOS expression
was blocked dramatically via NFkB inactivation (fig 3G),
which should suppress nitric oxide synthesis even after
reperfusion of Ad5IkB infected livers. If nitric oxide synthesis
is blocked, formation of peroxynitrite should be attenuated.
This hypothesis was supported by suppressed expression of
nitrotyrosine after reperfusion in these livers (fig 5C). Thus
we conclude that suppression of iNOS induction by IkBa SR
in non-parenchymal cells, possibly Kupffer cells, can account
for part of the beneficial effect from IkBa SR gene transfer in
the present study.
While the generally accepted mechanism of hepatic
reperfusion injury is cell damage involving oncotic necrosis,41
several recent reports have proposed that apoptotic cell death
during hepatic ischaemia/reperfusion also may participate in
the mechanism of the injury.21–23 NFkB is known as an
antiapoptotic transcription factor in the liver31 42 and its
blockade results in frequent occurrence of apoptosis of
hepatocytes under proapoptotic stimuli.28–31 In the present
study, we blocked NFkB activation after reperfusion in both
parenchymal and non-parenchymal cells by transfer of IkBa
SR. However, we observed no remarkable appearance of
apoptotic cells in Ad5IkB infected livers even at 12 hours
after reperfusion, while a few apoptotic cells, mainly non￾parenchymal cells, were detected in uninfected and Ad5LacZ
infected livers. Because the ssDNA staining might not be a
definitive tool for detecting apoptotic cells, we cannot
conclude that apoptotic cell death does not participate in
the mechanism underlying reperfusion injury in short term
warm total hepatic ischaemia. From our data, however, we
speculate that apoptotic cell death does not play a major role
in our model. Inactivation of NFkB in donor livers was found
to increase histologically evident tissue injury and apoptosis
after experimental liver transplantation representing cold
hepatic ischaemia/reperfusion.43 Differences in animal
models and duration of ischaemia may account for the
disagreement between that report and our study.
In summary, we successfully attenuated hepatic reperfu￾sion injury after short term warm total ischaemia by
delivering the IkBa SR gene to the rat liver. Because NFkB
may be required for proliferation of intact hepatocytes,31 non￾parenchymal cell selective as opposed to non-selective
inactivation of NFkB should be more beneficial if the strategy
of the present study were applied to clinical situations.
Moreover, relatively short term inactivation of NFkB limited
to non-parenchymal cells would be safer than adenoviral
gene expression of IkBa SR for 1–2 weeks. For example,
Kupffer cell selective transfer of NFkB decoy, which binds
NFkB and blocks its translocation to the nucleus,11 may come
to represent a clinically important way of preventing
ischaemia/reperfusion injury during hepatic surgery.

EDITOR’S QUIZ: GI SNAPSHOT ..................................................................
Answer
From question on page 813
Helical computed tomography scan revealed a low density, well circumscribed cystic mass,
21612622 cm in size, in the left hepatic lobe with multiple daughter cysts floating inside,
compatible with a hydatid cyst. The biliary system and spleen were normal (fig 1). Results of
serum IgG antibody titre to Echinococcus granulosus was higher than 1:2560. Likewise, a
pretreatment magnetic resonance cholangiogram was performed ruling out bile leaks.
In this case, perioperative treatment with albendazole, simple endocystectomy, aspiration
of the residual contents of the cyst cavity, and omentoplasty were performed. After two
months the patient was asymptomatic.
Cystic hydatic disease due to infection with the metacestode of Echinococcus granulosus has
a worldwide distribution, and the liver is the most common site (70%). Surgery is the
recommended treatment for hepatic hydatid cysts. However, encouraging reports suggest
that under carefully controlled conditions, percutaneous aspiration with the use of
concomitant antihelminthic therapy may be a safe alternative treatment.
