Abstract
Background: Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) accounts for a high mortality and morbidity. Early 
prediction of outcome is crucial for optimized care and treatment decision. Copeptin, the C-terminal part of 
provasopressin, has emerged as a new prognostic marker in a variety of diseases, but its prognostic value in ICH is 
unknown.
Methods: In 40 consecutive patients who were admitted to the hospital within 72 hours after a spontaneous ICH, the 
plasma copeptin level was measured with a sandwich immunoassay upon admission. The prognostic value of 
copeptin to predict 30 day mortality and functional outcome after 90 days was assessed. A favorable outcome was 
defined as a Barthel score above 85 and a score below 3 on the Modified Rankin Scale.
Results: Copeptin correlated positively with hematoma volume (r = 0.32, p < 0.05) and negatively with the Glasgow 
Coma Scale (GCS) on admission (r = -0.35, p < 0.05). Copeptin levels were higher in patients who died within 30 days 
than in 30-day survivors (179.0 pmol/l (IQR 33.7- 566.0) vs. 12.9 pmol/l (IQR 5.2 - 42.8), p = 0.003). Copeptin levels were 
also higher in patients with an unfavorable functional outcome at 90 days compared to patients with a favorable 
outcome (32.4 pmol/l (IQR 9.5-97.8) vs. 11.9 pmol/l (IQR 3.2-19.8), p = 0.04). For the prediction of death, receiver￾operating-characteristics analysis revealed an area under the curve (AUC) for copeptin of 0.88 (95%CI 0.75-1.00). The 
predictive value of the copeptin concentration was thus similar to that of GCS (AUC 0.82 (95%CI 0.59-1.00) p = 0.53), of 
the ICH Score (AUC 0.89, (95%CI 0.76-1.00), p = 0.94) and the ICH Grading Scale (AUC 0.86 (95%CI 0.69-1.00), p = 0.81).
Conclusions: Copeptin is a new prognostic marker in patients with an ICH. If this finding can be confirmed in larger 
studies, copeptin might be an additional valuable tool for risk stratification and decision-making in the acute phase of 
ICH.

Background
Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is more fatal and dis￾abling than ischemic stroke and ranges from 10 to 20
cases per 100,000 population reflecting 10 to 15 percent
of all stroke patients [1]. Early prognostication of the risk
of death or of a poor long-term outcome would enable
optimized care and improved allocation of health-care
resources. Several scales of outcome prediction after pri￾mary ICH have been proposed [2]. Dynamic factors like
hematoma volume expansion, edema formation or per￾sistent high blood pressure are known to be associated
with early neurologic deterioration and poor outcome[3].
In combination with the clinical findings, a readily mea￾surable predictive marker predicting mortality in patients
with ICH would be helpful for early prognostication and
risk stratification. Biomarkers are attracting increasing
attention as potential predictors of outcome in ischemic
and hemorrhagic stroke [4,5].
Copeptin, the C-terminal portion of provasopressin, is
a 39-amino acid glycopeptide that has been found to be a
stable and sensitive surrogate marker for vasopressin
(AVP) release [6]. As AVP is a potent synergistic factor of
the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis, copeptin might
act as a marker of the individual stress response. In fact, it

has been shown that copeptin measurement is useful for
prognostic assessment in patients with cardiovascular
diseases, lower respiratory tract infection, sepsis and
head injury [7,8]. Copeptin levels have also been found to
be elevated in ischemic stroke patients; in this group of
patients, high copeptin levels were highly predictive for
poor functional outcome and mortality[9].
We tested the hypothesis that high copeptin levels in
acute hemorrhagic stroke patients are also associated
with mortality and poor functional outcome.
Methods
Study design and setting
This is a prospective study evaluating copeptin concen￾trations in consecutive patients with hemorrhagic stroke
admitted to the Emergency Department of the University
Hospital of Basel, Switzerland from November 2006 until
November 2007 [9]. The study was approved by the local
ethical committee for human studies (EKBB) and regis￾tered in the ISCTRN database (ISCTRN 00390962 and
ClincalTrials.gov number NCT00390962). Informed con￾sent was obtained from the patients or their next of kin
before enrolment.
Participants
Forty consecutive patients who were admitted to the
emergency department with spontaneous ICH within 72
hours of symptom onset were prospectively analyzed.
Patients with a subarachnoid hemorrhage or traumatic
ICH were not included.
Neuroimaging
On the initial CT scan, the ICH volume was assessed with
the ABC/2 method[10]. In this method, A is the greatest
diameter on the largest hemorrhage slice, B is the diame￾ter perpendicular to A, and C is the number of axial slices
with hemorrhage multiplied by the slice thickness.
Clinical variables and follow up
Clinical status and severity of disease were assessed on
admission. For clinical assessment, the Glasgow Coma
Scale (GCS) was used, and relevant co-morbidities were
assessed with the Charlson co-morbidity index [11,12].
For the assessment of 30-day mortality and functional
outcome at 90 days, structured interviews were carried
out by a trained medical student who was blinded to
copeptin levels. Functional outcomes were measured
with the Barthel Index (BI) [13] and Modified Rankin
Scale (mRS)[14]. A favorable outcome was defined as a BI
score above 85 and a score below 3 on the mRS. To com￾pare the predictive value of copeptin with combined clin￾ical features, the ICH Score according to Hemphill [15]
and the ICH Grading Scale according to Ruiz-Sandoval
[16] was used.
Endpoints
The primary endpoint of this study was the predictive
value of copeptin for 30-day mortality in patients with
hemorrhagic stroke. 30-day mortality is a common end￾point in prognostic ICH studies[2]. The secondary end￾point was the functional outcome at 90 days, as measured
by the BI and the mRS.
Assays
Results of the routine blood analyses including sodium
concentrations, blood glucose, white blood cells, C-reac￾tive protein (CRP) (mg/ml) and serum osmolarity were
consecutively recorded in all patients. Immediately on
admission plasma was collected in plastic tubes contain￾ing ethylenediaminetatraacetic acid (EDTA). They were
placed on ice and then centrifuged at 3000 g and plasma
was frozen at -70°C until batch-analysis. Copeptin levels
were measured with a chemiluminescens sandwich
immunoassay with a lower detection limit of the assay of
0.4 pmol/l[17]. In healthy volunteers and under rest, nor￾mal copeptin levels have 4.0-4.4 pmol/l as range with only
5% of values lying outside this range [6].
Statistical analysis
A logarithmic transformation was performed to obtain a
normal distribution for skewed variables (i.e. copeptin
concentrations). Discrete variables were expressed as
counts (percentage) and continuous variables as medians
and interquartile ranges (IQR) unless stated otherwise.
Frequency comparisons were performed with the chi￾square test. Two-group comparisons were performed
with the Mann-Whitney-U test if only two groups were
compared and the Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of
variance was used if more than two groups were being
compared. Univariate regression models were calculated
to compare the prognostic accuracy of copeptin levels
with that of other prognostic parameters. Because of the
small number of outcomes, it was not reasonable to per￾form a multivariate analysis. Receiver-operating-charac￾teristics (ROC) were calculated with the area under the
curve (AUC) as an overall prognostic measure. All non￾linear data were log transformed before being entered
into the logistic regression models. To estimate the
potential clinical relevance of copeptin for the prediction
of mortality, we calculated Kaplan-Meier survival curves
and stratified patients on the basis of the median copep￾tin level, then used the log-rank test to compare the two
groups. Correlation analyses were performed with Spear￾man rank correlation. All testing was two-tailed, and P
values less than 0.05 were considered to indicate statisti￾cal significance. All calculations were performed with
STATA 9.2 (Stata Corp, College Station, Texas).

Results
Baseline Data
The median age of the 40 patients (45% female) was 71
years (IQR 64-78 years), the median GCS on admission
was 14 (IQR 13-15). The distribution of the hemorrhage
sites were as follows: lobar (47.5%), basal ganglia (45%)
and infratentorial (7.5%). The median hematoma volume
was 17.8 ml (IQR 6.3-36.3). Median copeptin values of
our cohort were 16.3 (IQR 6.3-54.3) pmol/l. The time
from symptom onset to blood withdrawal for copeptin
determination ranged from 2 to 72 hours. For 7 patients,
blood withdrawal was done in the first three hours, for 6
patients between 3 and 6 hours, for 7 between 6 and 12
hours, for 9 patients between 12 and 24 hours and for 11
patients between 24 and 72 hours. Copeptin levels were
not significantly different between these groups. Copep￾tin correlated furthermore with ICH volume (r = 0.32, p <
0.05), with GCS (r = -0.35, p < 0.03) and blood glucose (r
= 0.53, p = 0.0008) on admission.
Four patients underwent hematoma evacuation, 3
patients received a ventricular drainage. In most cases,
ICH was presumed to be due to uncontrolled hyperten￾sion. 9 patients (22.5%) had been taking antiplatelets or
anticoagulant drugs before the ICH occurred.
Primary Endpoint
On follow-up at 30 days, 6 patients had died, yielding a
30-day mortality of 15%. None of the patients had died
due to withdrawal of care. Table 1 shows the baseline
characteristics of the survivors and non-survivors on
admission. The non-survivors tended to be older, and
were more frequently female. Neurological examination
on admission revealed a lower GCS level in non-survivors
than in survivors (10 pmol/l (IQR 5-13) vs. 14 pmol/l
(IQR 14-15), p = 0.009). Copeptin levels were signifi￾cantly higher in non-survivors than in survivors (179.0
pmol/l (IQR 33.7- 566.0) vs. 12.9 pmol/l (IQR 5.2-42.8), p
= 0.003) (Figure 1). In univariate logistic regression analy￾sis, only GCS, the volume of the ICH, and the copeptin
level were significant predictors of mortality (Table 2).
The overall prognostic accuracy of copeptin as assessed
in ROC curve analysis (AUC 0.88 (95%CI 0.75-1.00) was
comparable to that of the GCS (AUC 0.82 (95%CI 0.59-
1.00), p = 0.56), of the ICH Score[15] (AUC 0.89, (95%CI
0.76-1.00), p = 0.94) and the ICH Grading Scale[16] (AUC
0.86 (95%CI 0.69-1.00), p = 0.81).
To illustrate the prognostic value of copeptin in pre￾dicting mortality, we calculated Kaplan-Meier survival
curves and divided the patients into two groups depend￾ing on whether their copeptin level was above or below
the median value (16.3 pmol/l). As shown in Figure 2,
patients with copeptin levels above the median were sig￾nificantly more likely to die within 30 days (p < 0.01).
These patients had also on admission a significantly
lower GCS (13.5 vs 15, p = 0.02), higher plasma glucose
(7.6 vs 5.9 mmol/l, p = 0.03) and higher white blood count
(WBC, 9.1 vs 8.5 × 109/l, p = 0.01). All other baseline
parameters were not significantly different.
Functional outcome
On day 90, 18 patients (45%) had a favorable outcome,
which was defined as Barthel score of 85 or more and a
Modified Rankin score below 3, while 22 patients (55%)
had an unfavorable outcome. Copeptin levels on admis￾sion were significantly higher in patients with an unfavor￾able outcome (32.4 (IQR 9.5-97.8) vs. 11.9 (IQR 3.2-19.8),
p = 0.04). Age, GCS, the volume of ICH, and copeptin
levels were significant predictors of functional outcome
in univariate logistic regression analysis (Table 3). In
ROC analysis, copeptin had an AUC of 0.68 (95%CI 0.52-
0.86) which did not differ to any statistically significant
extent from the AUC of lesion size (AUC 0.75 (95%CI
0.60-0.91), p = 0.28) or of GCS (AUC 0.81 (95%CI 0.68-
0.94), p = 0.24), the ICH Score [15] (AUC 0.83, (95%CI
0.71-0.95), p = 0.14) and the ICH Grading Scale[16] (AUC
0.81 (95%CI 0.68-0.93), p = 0.21).
Discussion
In this prospective study, we demonstrate for the first
time that serum copeptin levels measured on admission
are associated with 30-day mortality and 90-day func￾tional outcome after ICH.
Copeptin is co-synthesized with vasopressin in the
hypothalamus and is released into the portal circulation
of the neurohypophysis. Vasopressin contributes to the
regulation of osmotic and cardiovascular homeosta￾sis[18,19]. In addition, vasopressin activates the hypo￾thalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis through potentiation of
corticotropin-releasing-hormone-induced ACTH secre￾tion and thus reflects the individual stress response at a
hypothalamic level[20-22]. Copeptin is known to have
prognostic value in a variety of diseases, as it reflects dis￾ease severity and thus the chance of recovery. For exam￾ple, copeptin levels are independent predictors of survival
in critically ill patients suffering from hemorrhagic and
septic shock [23]. Furthermore, copeptin levels have
prognostic implications in patients with acute myocardial
infarction and in patients with acute heart failure[24,25].
Therefore, it has been hypothesized that the close and
reproducible relation of copeptin levels to the degree of
activation of the stress axis is the basis of its unique use￾fulness as a prognostic biomarker [9]. In our study,
copeptin was correlated with hematoma volume, which
in turn is associated with clinical severity and outcome.
In accordance with this hypothesis, an earlier study
showed a correlation between the severity of head injury
and copeptin levels on admission[8,26]. In another study,
copeptin was associated with lesion size and clinical

severity on admission but was still an independent prog￾nostic marker in patients with an acute ischemic stroke
[9]. This suggests that copeptin on one hand is associated
with the severity of the disease, in ICH patients mirrored
by the lesion or the GCS, on the other hand it might still
provide additional information related to brain damage.
Copeptin mirrors circulating vasopressin levels and
vasopressin itself may also directly influence the clinical
course. Data from experimental studies imply that vaso￾pressin plays a role in brain edema formation as blocking
of vasopressin receptors attenuates brain edema in isch￾emic and traumatic mice models[27-29]. The relationship
between vasopressin levels and brain edema development

has also been demonstrated in a clinical study of head￾injured patients[30]. Brain edema formation predicts an
unfavorable outcome in ICH[31]. Therefore, copeptin
levels might reflect developing or existing brain edema
and might therefore be helpful in identifying patients at
risk for brain edema formation who could profit from
therapeutic interventions, such as the administration of a
vasopressin antagonist[28]. A limitation of our study was
that we could not monitor brain edema formation and
link it with copeptin values, because imaging studies of
the brain were not routinely repeated. Hence, the impli￾cation of copeptin and brain edema formation in ICH
remains hypothetical at the moment.
Copeptin predicted mortality and functional outcome
in our ICH cohort and its discriminative power was in the
range of GCS, hematoma volume and age, which are
known to be strong individual outcome predictors, espe￾cially when used in combination[15,16,32]. Other bio￾markers have been shown to predict early neurologic
deterioration and mortality in ICH patients, i.e. D-dimer
[33], glutamate [34], matrix metalloproteinases [3] and
protein S100b [35]. Each of these biomarkers reflects a
different pathophysiological process which also might
have a specific therapeutic implication[5]. In our opinion
it is advisable to rely the difficult task of prognostic
assessment and treatment decisions upon several param￾eters. In this context copeptin might have an interesting
potential as a new prognostic biomarker in combination
with clinical features.
Our study cohort was too small to allow a meaningful
multivariate analysis. We thus could not determine
whether copeptin is an independent prognostic marker
that yields additional information beyond that derivable
from other known prognostic factors such as GCS and
hematoma volume (both of which are correlated with the
copeptin level). These associations were expected since
GCS and hematoma volume are strong outcome predic￾tors. It has been shown in a larger cohort in patients with
ischemic stroke on the other hand that copeptin is a very
strong independent prognostic marker (i.e., independent
of age, lesion size, glucose, WBC, CRP and clinical sever￾ity on admission) for functional outcome and mortality.
Thus it is possible that in a larger cohort copeptin might

prove to be an independent marker also in ICH patients
[9].
Another limitation of our study is that our cohort
included both surgically and non-surgically treated
patients. Surgical treatment is unlikely to have influenced
the prognosis heavily, however, as the STICH trial did not
show any significant benefit of early surgery versus initial
conservative treatment[36].

Our study included all patients who presented to the
ED within 72 hours after the onset of clinical symptoms,
and thus constitutes a heterogeneous population. Due to
our limited sample size, we are not able to assess the time
effect in our study. In the aforementioned [9] ischemic
stroke trial however, a subgroup analysis revealed no dif￾ference in the predictive value of the copeptin level
depending on whether it was measured 0-3 hours, 3-6
hours, 6-12 hours, 12-24 hours, or 24-72 hours after
symptom onset.
Conclusion
In conclusion, in our cohort of patients with ICH, copep￾tin was significantly associated with 30-day mortality and
with a poor functional outcome at 90 days. If this finding
can be validated and confirmed in larger studies, the
measurement of copeptin levels may allow together with
other clinical parameters improved risk stratification for
ICH patients in the future.

* Note that the odds ratio corresponds to a unit increase in the explanatory variable; for copeptin this corresponds to an increase per unit of 
the log-transformation of copeptin (thus a log transformed increase of 1 corresponds to a copeptin increase of 10 pmol/l). ICH Score 
according to Hemphill [15]; ICH Grading Scale according to Ruiz-Sandoval [15].
