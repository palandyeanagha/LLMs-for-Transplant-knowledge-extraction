Abstract
Despite the prevalence of Aspergillus-related disease in immune suppressed lung transplant patients, little is known
of the host-pathogen interaction. Because of the mould’s angiotropic nature and because of its capacity to thrive in
hypoxic conditions, we hypothesized that the degree of Aspergillus invasion would increase with progressive
rejection-mediated ischemia of the allograft. To study this relationship, we utilized a novel orthotopic tracheal
transplant model of Aspergillus infection, in which it was possible to assess the effects of tissue hypoxia and
ischemia on airway infectivity. Laser Doppler flowmetry and FITC-lectin were used to determine blood perfusion, and
a fiber optic microsensor was used to measure airway tissue oxygen tension. Fungal burden and depth of invasion
were graded using histopathology. We demonstrated a high efficacy (80%) for producing a localized fungal tracheal
infection with the majority of infection occurring at the donor-recipient anastomosis; Aspergillus was more invasive in
allogeneic compared to syngeneic groups. During the study period, the overall kinetics of both non-infected and
infected allografts was similar, demonstrating a progressive loss of perfusion and oxygenation, which reached a nadir
by days 10-12 post-transplantation. The extent of Aspergillus invasion directly correlated with the degree of graft
hypoxia and ischemia. Compared to the midtrachea, the donor-recipient anastomotic site exhibited lower perfusion
and more invasive disease; a finding consistent with clinical experience. For the first time, we identify ischemia as a
putative risk factor for Aspergillus invasion. Therapeutic approaches focused on preserving vascular health may play
an important role in limiting Aspergillus infections.

Introduction
Aspergillus fumigatus is a ubiquitous mould that grows in
decaying organic matter and releases airborne spores, which
can result in a variety of respiratory tract infections including
persistent colonization, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis
(ABPA), Aspergillus tracheobronchitis, chronic necrotizing
Aspergillus pneumonia and invasive pulmonary aspergillosis
(IPA) [1]. The presentation of these lung diseases varies
according to the comorbid status of the host [1]. For example,
patients with cystic fibrosis and asthma often are affected by
Aspergillus colonization or ABPA but rarely develop IPA [1,2].
Aspergillus colonization is common in chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), and less commonly chronic
necrotizing pneumonia and IPA are also seen [1,3]. For lung
transplant recipients, infection with A. fumigatus represents a
major cause of morbidity, with mortality rates as high as 82%
[4-7]. In addition to IPA, lung transplant patients are at risk for
A. fumigatus infections of the tracheal anastomosis, resulting in
serious bronchial complications and chronic graft rejection,
which has been associated with Aspergillus colonization
[5,8,9]. Despite the considerable morbidity of these infections,
little is known of the host-pathogen interactions that predispose
persons to the wide range of Aspergillus-related pulmonary
diseases.
Aspergillus, while considered a facultative aerobe, can grow
in severely hypoxic conditions at oxygen levels as low as 0.1%
(0.76 mmHg) [10]. Recently, researchers have begun to
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 October 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 10 | e77136

elucidate the capacity of Aspergillus to adapt to hypoxic
environments that may allow the pathogen to modulate the
host inflammatory response [11]. Additionally, studies have
implicated gliotoxin, a secondary metabolite of Aspergillus, as
capable of inhibiting host angiogenesis [12]. Together, these
observations suggest a dynamic host-pathogen interaction
whereby the fungus adapts to and simultaneously induces a
favorable ischemic microenvironment; a property that likely
confers an advantage in virulence.
Lung transplants are particularly vulnerable to the effects of
graft ischemia, as they are the only solid organ allograft that
does not undergo primary systemic arterial revascularization
(i.e., bronchial artery restoration) at the time of surgery. This
results in a prolonged period of relative hypoxia in the grafted
organ [13]. Following surgery, transplant airways are presumed
to rely principally on the pulmonary artery microcirculation and
these vessels display foreign HLA antigens making them a
target for allospecific immunity. In rejection, microvascular
injury leads to tissue infarction [14]; these ischemic zones may
provide a substrate for the growth of microorganisms
analogous to the devascularized tissues of diabetic patients,
promoting chronic infections. Yet, there is a paucity of
information regarding the risk factors that predispose lung
transplant patients to fungal infections, the effect of vascular
ischemia on the pathogenesis of Aspergillus infections, or the
role that the bronchial circulation may play in maintaining the
host’s defense mechanism [15]. Because of this mould’s
angiotropic nature and capacity to thrive under hypoxic
conditions [10-12,16], we hypothesized that the degree of
Aspergillus invasion would increase with the progressive
ischemia of the rejecting allograft.
We have developed a technique for airway transplantation,
known as orthotopic tracheal transplantation (OTT). The OTT
model, due to the planar anatomy of the trachea, is an ideal
model for studying the microvasculature in transplantation
because of how blood vessels are linearly displayed in two
dimensions, in contrast to the complex anatomy of vessels in
terminal airways, which are difficult to capture by histological
techniques. Our research group has previously demonstrated
that acutely rejecting tracheal transplants undergo a series of
distinct microvascular events including: 1) reperfusion of the
donor graft from reanastomosis with recipient vessels that is
partially dependent on hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) pathways
[17], 2) profound ischemia due to CD4+
 T cells and
complement-mediated rejection [18], and 3) recipient-derived
neovascularization [17].
In the current study, we utilized the OTT model of Aspergillus
infection to evaluate the role that microvascular ischemia plays
in promoting Aspergillus invasion. We show that the
Aspergillus-OTT model mimics the tracheal infections observed
clinically in lung transplant patients. We observe for the first
time, that the depth of A. fumigatus invasion correlated with
progressive rejection-mediated vascular ischemia and hypoxia.
Aspergillus infection also correlated with a decrease in regional
blood perfusion. By elucidating the complex host-pathogen
interaction that may contribute to this clinical dilemma for lung
transplant recipients, this model has the potential to facilitate
the development of novel therapeutic concepts that may help
prevent or improve the treatment of fungal infections in lung
transplant recipients.
Methods
Experimental design
All animal studies were performed with the approval of the
Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Heath Care System’s Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol number NIM1483)
under the guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals
from the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare of the National
Institutes for Health. In addition, The Stanford University
Applied Panel on Biosafety (protocol number 1007-MN0312)
approved all microbiological experiments performed in this
study. All research was conducted according to the ethical and
regulatory standards as outlined in the U.S. Government
Principles for the Utilization and Care of Vertebrate Animals
Used in Testing, Research and Training (prepared by the
Interagency Research Animal Committee), the Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (prepared by the National
Research Council) and the AVMA Guidelines on Euthanasia.
Five-week old male C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice were
purchased from Jackson Laboratories. Groups consisted of >4
mice in all experiments. We initially developed the OTT A.
fumigatus infection model in allogeneic transplants (BALB/c
donor to B6 recipient) compared with syngeneic transplants
(B6 donor and recipient). Through an iterative process, we
determined inoculation route and conidial quantity sufficient to
produce a localized tracheal infection in >80% of animals.
We initially infected syngeneic and allogeneic animals on day
10 post-transplant. Subsequent studies evaluated allogeneic
animals infected on days 3, 6, and 10 post-transplant. For
perfusion and tissue oxygen tension experiments, animals
were evaluated on post-infection days 1 and 2 (n = 4-8
animals/time point). For example, an animal infected on post￾transplant day 3 was evaluated on post-infection days 1 and 2,
representing the animal’s post-transplant day 4 and 5,
respectively. Non-infected animals were evaluated at 2-day
intervals post-transplantation (n = 4-8 animals/time point). For
FITC-lectin studies infected animals were evaluated 2 days
post-infection and compared to non-infected animals on the
equivalent post-transplant day (n = 3-5 animals/group). For
example, an animal infected on day 3 post-transplant was
studied with FITC-lectin on day 5 post-transplant (post-infection
day 2) and compared to a non-infected control on post￾transplant day 5. Initially, we compared regional perfusion
differences in infected and non-infected animals post-transplant
(syngeneic and allogeneic) day 8 (n = 4-8 animals/experimental
group). We then evaluated regional perfusion differences in
infected allografts on post-transplant days 5 and 12. Fungal
burden and depth of fungal invasion were measured
histopathologically on post-infection day 2 (n = 7-11 animals/
group). These animals were compared to non-transplanted
controls treated with triamcinolone acetonide and inoculated
with A. fumigatus (n = 6 animals/group). For additional details
of the experimental approach see Figure S1.

Orthotopic tracheal transplant
Transplants were performed, as previously described
[17,18]. Briefly, a seven-ring tracheal segment was removed
from a CO2
-euthanized donor. Recipient mice were
anesthetized with 50 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine,
and a short incision was made at the midline neck region. After
the recipient’s trachea was transected, the donor trachea was
sewn in with 10-0 nylon sutures (2 sutures at the cephalad and
3 sutures at the caudal anastomoses, respectively) and the
overlying skin was closed with 5-0 silk (Figure 1A).
Aspergillus fumigatus infection model
Aspergillus fumigatus, 10AF (ATCC 90240) was used as the
challenge organism for all infections. Cultures were revived
from long-term storage at -80°C by growth at 37°C on potato
dextrose agar. Conidia were harvested by washing the surface
of the agar plate with 0.05% Tween 80 in saline (v/v). The
conidial suspension was vortexed to disperse clumps of conidia
and stored at 4°C until needed. Viability was assessed by
quantitative plating of serial dilutions of the conidia onto
Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) plates. These were incubated
for 48 hours at 37°C and the number of colonies counted. The
suspension was then diluted to the desired number of conidia
per ml. Prior to infection conidia were centrifuged (5000 x g for
5 min) and then washed twice with 1X PBS after centrifugation
to remove excess Tween. Transplanted mice were inoculated
with A. fumigatus (3-4 x 108
 conidia/ml in 40 µl volume) while
under anesthesia (ketamine/xylazine). Inoculation occurred via
direct tracheal inoculation in which 40 μl of the conidial solution
was placed inside the trachea and allowed to dwell for 1 hour,
prior to transplantation. Inoculation also occurred by intra￾tracheal injection, in which a 40 μl conidial solution was
injected at a point 2 tracheal rings rostral to the cephalad
anastomosis. For this procedure we used a 29-gauge insulin
syringe. After inoculation, all animals, including controls, were
administered triamcinolone acetonide (40 mg/kg)
subcutaneously. Clinical observations were noted and weights
determined daily. At day 2 after infection, all surviving mice
were euthanatized using CO2
 asphyxia.

Measurement of microvascular perfusion and luminal
oxygen tension
Prior to euthanasia, we determined the degree of
microvascular perfusion and tissue oxygen tension of the graft,
as described previously [17-19]. Briefly, OTT recipients were
anesthetized (ketamine/xylazine), the trachea was exposed
and a Laser Doppler flowmetry probe was placed abutting the
anterior membranous portion between tracheal rings, using a
micromanipulator (Figure 1E). For each location of interest nine
serial, blood perfusion unit (BPU) measurements (right, center,
and left, in triplicate) were obtained. For tissue oxygen tension
(pO2
) measurements a small hole was made in the ventral
trachea within 2 rings of the anastomosis. Serial
measurements were taken as described elsewhere [18,19]. For
infected allografts, blood perfusion and tissue pO2 were
measured at 24 hours and 48 hours after infection. Thus,
measurements for infected allografts were obtained on days 4,
5, 7, 8, 11 and 12 post-transplantation. For non-infected
controls, we obtained measurements at two-day intervals.
FITC-lectin microvascular perfusion studies
In addition, we performed FITC-lectin perfusion studies as
previously described [17-19]. This procedure was used to
confirm whether vessels were functional and continuous with
the systemic circulation. Briefly, 100 μl of 1mg/mL lectin (Vector
Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was injected by direct cardiac
puncture with a 29-gauge needle over one minute. After three
minutes of circulation, a sternotomy was performed followed by
right atriotomy and cannulation of the aorta via the left ventricle
with an 18-gauge angiocatheter. One percent
paraformaldehyde in PBS was perfused via the aorta for 2
minutes at 120 mmHg. The orthotopic tracheal graft along with
adjoining recipient trachea was dissected from the surrounding
tissues. The trachea was removed with both recipient ends and
divided along the ventral midline, creating a flat piece of tissue,
and was processed for confocal microscopy (Figure 1B-D).
Histological preparation and evaluation of tracheal
samples
The presence and extent of fungal invasion was determined
by histology. All tracheal samples were placed in paraffin
blocks and cut longitudinally or transversely in 5-μm sections
through the entire tracheal segment. Grocott’s methenamine
silver (GMS) staining was performed for each of these sections
(Histotech laboratories, Hayward, CA). For measurements of
both fungal burden and invasion the most severe section was
scored for each tracheal sample. On average per tracheal
sample the number of fields evaluated histologically with a
GMS-stain were 180 for longitudinal sections and 400 fields for
transverse sections. An experienced clinician (JH) evaluated all
histological slides microscopically. A board certified anatomic
pathologist (RS), blinded to experimental group, graded fungal
burden and invasion. Differences in grading were adjudicated
by a consensus score decided jointly by reviewers (JH and
RS). Fungal infection was defined by the presence of hyphal
elements on GMS stain in the tracheal segment. The degree of
fungal invasion was semiquantitatively graded: 1 (minimal)
invasion of the epithelial layer, 2 (mild) invasion of the
subepithelial layer, 3 (moderate), invasion to the depth of the
cartilaginous tracheal ring, and 4 (severe), invasion through the
tracheal wall with abluminal evidence of fungal infection (Figure
S2A). The degree of fungal burden was determined using a
semiquantitative scoring system as follows: 0, no fungal
elements, 1 (minimal), fungal hyphae in less than 25% of the
luminal area, 2 (mild) hyphae occluding 25% to 49% of the
tracheal area, 3 (moderate) hyphae 50% to 74% of tracheal
area, and 4 (severe) greater than 75% occlusion of the tracheal
area (Figure S2B).
Determination of disseminated infection
To determine dissemination of infection we quantified fungal
burden in the kidney and lung using colony forming units (CFU)
and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The fungal
burden in organs was determined by quantitative plating of
organ homogenates as described previously [20]. Organs were
weighed and placed in 5 ml saline with penicillin and
streptomycin in a Whirlpak bag and homogenized. Additional
serial dilutions were made and samples plated onto SDA with
50 mg of chloramphenicol per liter. In addition, the remaining
sample of each homogenate was frozen at -80°C for DNA
extraction for qPCR determination of the burden of A.
fumigatus. After mechanical breakage of the homogenate using
0.5 mm zirconia beads in a Beadbeater (BioSpec, Bartlesville,
OK), DNA was extracted using a QiAmp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen
Inc, Valencia, CA) per manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative
PCR was performed in triplicate samples using the following
primers of the 28S rRNA of A. fumigatus: 28S-466 (5’-CTC
GGA ATG TAT CAC CTC TCG G-3’) and 28S-533 (5’-TCC
TCG GTC CAG GCA GG-3’); and the Taqman probe was
28S-490 (5’-6-carboxyfluorescein-TGT CTT ATA GCC GAG
GGT GCA ATG CG-3’-6-carboxy tetramethylrhodamine) [21].
DNA was amplified and fluorescence detected with a
Thermocycler/ABI Prism 7700 sequence detector (Applied
Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) with the following cycle conditions:
95°C for 10 min followed by 45 amplification cycles (15
seconds of denaturation at 95°C and 1 min of hybridization and
elongation at 60°C) [21]. Known concentrations of conidia/ml
were spiked into naïve (uninfected) tissues (kidney and lung)
and the equivalent cycle threshold (Ct) was used to create a
standard conidial equivalent curve for the respective organ.
Colony forming units and qPCR conidial equivalents were
standardized by weight of the organ in grams.
Statistics
GraphPad Prism version 5.0c and SPSS were used for
statistical analysis. Differences in BPU and tissue pO2
tension
between infected and non-infected allografts were evaluated
using an unpaired Student’s t-test. A paired t-test was used to
compare the mean BPU and tissue oxygen tension differences
between the cephalad anastomosis and the midtracheal
segments in each animal. Inter-rater reliability of the
semiquantitative scoring method for fungal burden and invasion
were evaluated by a Kappa statistic, using SPSS. Degree of
agreement was based on criteria developed by Fleiss [22].
Semiquantitative differences in fungal burden and depth of
invasion by day post-transplant were evaluated by a non￾Aspergillus Invasion Increases with Ischemia

parametric Kruskal-Wallis test. A Dunn’s multiple comparisons
test was used to evaluate differences between days. All t-tests
were two-tailed, and significance was judged at a level of p
<0.05.
Results
High efficacy of tracheal infection in the OTT A.
fumigatus model
As an initial “proof of principle” study to establish a localized
infection in the tracheal graft, we directly inoculated the
tracheal segment and transplanted the graft into recipient
allogeneic or syngeneic animals. On average 180 longitudinal
sections or 400 transverse sections per tracheal sample were
evaluated histologically with a GMS-stain. Using the technique
of direct tracheal inoculation, we established an invasive
infection of the tracheal lumen in all animals (Figure 2A-C,E).
We then infected syngeneic and allogeneic transplanted
animals by intra-tracheal injection. Using a 108 conidia/ml
inoculum, we consistently produced a histopathologically
evident tracheal infection in 80% (8/10) of allogeneic
transplants. By comparison, a 107
 conidial/ml inoculum
produced an infection in 60% (3/5) of allogeneic animals. Once
we demonstrated the efficacy of the intra-tracheal injection
method all subsequent experiments utilized this form of
inoculation. In these initial experiments, regardless of the route
of infection (direct tracheal infection at the time of
transplantation or intra-tracheal injection following
transplantation) or transplant type (syngeneic or allogeneic),
infection occurred primarily at the anastomosis site dividing the
donor graft from the recipient (Figure 2). Moreover, the
infection was largely confined to the grafted segment. Thus,
this OTT model mimics the unique predilection for anastomotic
Aspergillus infections observed clinically among lung transplant
recipients [8].
Allogeneic transplants demonstrate a more invasive
Aspergillus infection than syngeneic transplants at day
12 post-transplantation
We previously demonstrated that by day 12, allografts
exhibited severe immune-mediated microvascular angiopathy,
whereas syngrafts maintain their microvascular integrity [18].
To explore the hypothesis that A. fumigatus may be influenced
by the graft’s microvascular health, we first sought to determine
histological differences in Aspergillus infection between
allogeneic and syngeneic transplants at day 12. Regardless of
transplant type, hyphae were evident primarily at the donor￾recipient anastomosis in 73% (8/11) of infected animals. For
the remaining 3 animals, infection was present throughout the
length of the graft. In the syngeneic transplant model,
histopathology showed hyphal masses that completely
occluded the tracheal lumen (Figure 3D). However, despite the
high fungal burden, hyphal elements did not invade, or only
minimally invaded, the luminal epithelium of syngeneic
transplants. By contrast, the histopathology of the allogeneic
transplants was characterized by an extensive fungal burden,
and all samples displayed an aggressive hyphal invasion to the
level of the tracheal cartilaginous ring, extending beyond the
subepithelium (Figure 3A-C). Thus, allogeneic transplants
experienced invasive A. fumigatus infections, whereas the
infection in syngeneic transplants was analogous to Aspergillus
airway colonization.
Infected and non-infected allografts display similar
blood perfusion and overall tissue oxygen kinetics
Because A. fumigatus has been shown to modulate host
angiogenesis [12], we sought to characterize the effect that
Aspergillus may have on blood perfusion and tissue pO2
kinetics in infected and non-infected allogeneic grafts at various
days post-transplant. As previously observed by our group, we
demonstrated that substantive changes in blood perfusion
occur in the allograft at the following time points: days 3-5, an
increased perfusion due to the reanastomosis of recipient and
donor vessels; days 6-8, the onset of immune-mediated
vascular rejection; and days 10-12, the time of maximal graft
ischemia (Figure 4) [18]. Accordingly, to study the impact of
these microvascular changes on A. fumigatus growth patterns,
we chose to infect animals on days 3, 6 and 10 post-transplant.
FITC-lectin studies were performed in infected and non￾infected animals on days 5, 8 and 12 post-transplant.
Blood perfusion differences between infected and non￾infected allografts were measured using a Doppler flowmetry
probe [18]. Overall kinetics of both infected and non-infected
allografts were similar, demonstrating progressive
microvascular rarefaction from day 8 to day 12 post￾transplantation (Figure 4A). Blood perfusion units in these
animals declined from 385.2 bpu to 183.8 bpu, and 408 bpu to
112.9 bpu in infected and non-infected allografts, respectively.
In our previous work, BPU levels of 170 bpu or less were
considered to be severely ischemic (Figure 4A, shaded area)
[18]. A significantly lower blood perfusion for infected compared
to non-infected allografts was observed only at day 4 (285.7
bpu and 392.8 bpu, respectively, p=0.003). The results from
the Doppler flowmetry probe were consistent with the FITC￾lectin perfusion studies performed on days 5, 8 and 12 (Figure
4C). In these studies, we demonstrate perfusion on day 5 and
8, which disappears by day 12. We observed a relative
microvascular dilation of the midtracheal vessels compared to
those at the anastomosis (Figure 4C).
Confirming results from our previous studies, the luminal
surface of the rejecting allograft undergoes progressive
hypoxia starting at day 6 after transplantation [18]. Based on
our previous research, oxygen levels below 16 mmHg (2.1%)
were defined as severely ischemic (Figure 4B, shaded area)
[18]. In non-infected allografts, oxygen tension decreased from
day 6 (32 mmHg) to day 12 (12.4 mmHg) and infected
allografts had levels of 23 mmHg and 7.1 mmHg on day 7 and
12, respectively (Figure 4B). Luminal oxygen tension was
significantly lower in infected compared to non-infected
allografts at day 4 (24.8 mmHg and 29.8 mmHg, respectively
p=0.02) and day 12 (7.1 mmHg and 12.4 mmHg, respectively
p=0.008).

Regional perfusion differences occur in Aspergillus￾infected allografts
Because of the anastomotic predilection for infection
observed in our initial studies (Figure 2), we evaluated regional
blood perfusion differences between the cephalad anastomosis
and the midtracheal segment by transplantation type and
infection status for day 8 animals (Figure 5A). In infected
animals regional perfusion differences were assessed on the
second day of infection after inoculation on day 6 post￾transplant. Our results demonstrate a significantly higher
Doppler flowmetry blood perfusion in the midtracheal segment
(424 bpu) compared with the anastomotic segment (324.3 bpu)
for allograft animals at day 8 (p=0.03). Regional differences in
BPU were not observed for non-infected animals or syngeneic
transplants infected with A. fumigatus. To further evaluate the
BPU differences in infected allografts, we measured regional
perfusion differences by day post-transplantation (Figure 5B).
The BPU for allografts at day 5 was 420.5 bpu and 259.9 bpu,
for midtracheal and anastomotic segments, respectively
(p=0.03). There were no significant regional perfusion
differences observed in day 12 allotransplants.
Aspergillus fumigatus invasion increases with allograft
tissue ischemia
To determine if the depth and burden of Aspergillus infection
increase with rejection- mediated airway ischemia and hypoxia,
we evaluated the histopathology of allografts at days 5, 8 and
12 (Figure 6) post-transplant. After 2 days of infection, animals

at each time point were compared using a semiquantitative 4-
point scale for fungal burden and depth of invasion (for
histological examples of our semiquantitative scoring system
see Figure S2). The inter-interpreter agreement for the scoring
of histopathology slides, as measured by the Kappa statistic,
was 0.82 for fungal burden and 0.71 for depth of invasion,
suggesting an excellent level of inter-interpreter agreement
[22]. Day 12 animals consistently demonstrated the highest
grade of invasion observed (88% (7/8) grade 3). By contrast,
no animals at day 5 (0/10), and 27% (3/11) at day 8
demonstrated a grade 3 depth of A. fumigatus invasion (Figure
6) (Kruskal-Wallis test, p=0.0006). Grade 4 invasion was not
observed among these animals. Using qPCR and CFU of lung
and kidney samples, we were not able to demonstrate an
association between increased local invasion and systemic
dissemination of A. fumigatus (Figure S3). Degree of fungal
burden was highest in allografts at day 12 with 63% (5/8) with
grade ≥ 3 compared to day 5 (0/10) or 8 (37% (4/11)) (Kruskal￾Wallis test, p=0.07). Among infected animals Aspergillus
hyphae were located primarily at the donor-recipient
anastomosis on day 5: 89% (8/9), day 8: 90% (9/10) and day
12: 63% (5/8). For the remaining day 12 animals infection
occurred throughout the grafted segment. In non-transplanted
controls, injecting a 108
 conidial/ml suspension intra-tracheally,
produced no luminal infections in the six animals tested. In
summary, the capacity for A. fumigatus to cause invasive
disease increased significantly following the microvascular
destruction and ischemic period of allograft rejection, and
infection showed a special predilection for the poorly perfused
anastomotic site.
Discussion
Among lung transplant patients, more than one in three
deaths in the first year will be from non-cytomegalovirus
(CMV)-related infections; yet few studies have examined the

underlying risk factors for their development [15,23]. Among
these non-CMV infections, A. fumigatus is a common cause of
morbidity and a potent predictor for increased mortality [5,6].
Putative risk factors include the degree of immune
suppression, the route of pathogen exposure, the degree of
airway ciliary dysfunction, and the absence of an effective
cough [15]. Our current studies show for the first time that
microvascular ischemia also may contribute to an increased
risk of A. fumigatus invasion.
The proclivity for Aspergillus survival at ischemic sites has
been suggested by previous studies and by the well-described
angiotropic nature of the fungus. Grahl and colleagues have
shown, in murine models of IPA, that Aspergillus growth occurs
in hypoxic conditions [11]. Using a hypoxia-detecting agent,
pimonidazole hydrochloride, they demonstrated that invasive
Aspergillus encounters severe hypoxia <10 mmHg in the lung
and thrives in this microenvironment [11,24]. In our study a
similar level of hypoxia was encountered only in infected
animals at day 12 post-transplant (7.1 mmHg). The ability of
Aspergillus to survive and thrive in hypoxic tissues provides a
biological mechanism by which the mould may adapt to the
varying ischemic conditions present in the current OTT model.
In spite of this growing understanding, the host-pathogen
interaction at the microvascular level is relatively unknown.

Aspergillus Invasion Increases with Ischemia
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 8 October 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 10 | e77136

In our current study, A. fumigatus infection localized to the
donor-recipient anastomosis regardless of the route of
infection, level of ischemia or the presence of an alloimmune
response. In 83% (25/30) of all animals infected, hyphal
elements were seen primarily at the junction between the donor
and recipient trachea. Thus, the phenotype of our murine
model replicates the anatomic diathesis for the anastomotic
infections observed clinically in lung transplant recipients.
Several possible explanations may account for this finding
including: the anatomic narrowing at this site, the tissue
redundancy occurring as a consequence of the surgical
‘telescoping’ of one airway end tucked into the other end, the
presence of foreign suture material and/or the attraction of the
mould to an unidentified factor, present preferentially at the
anastomosis. To evaluate one of these alternative hypotheses
for anastomotic infection, in our preliminary experiments, we
placed additional suture material in the middle of the allograft
and on the recipient trachea above and below the cephalad
and caudad anastomosis. We also placed suture material in
non-transplanted controls. In none of these animals did
infection appear to localize to the extra suture material within
the graft or in the recipient trachea (data not shown). Thus, we
suspect that suture material in the graft does not explain the
localization of the infection at the anastomoses.
Our research group has shown that the OTT anastomosis is
a potent area of angiogenesis dependent on HIF-1α and Sdf1,
a chemokine involved in the recruitment of angiogenic cells to
hypoxic areas [17]. Through gene transfer experiments we
have shown that HIF-1α overexpression by the allograft
promotes microvascular stabilization, prolonging allograft
perfusion to day 12 post-transplantation and accelerates
neovascularization of the graft [17]. The predilection for an A.
fumigatus anastomotic infection, in conjunction with our primary
observation of progressive invasion with increasing ischemia,
similarly suggests the presence of a factor that recruits
Aspergillus to areas of ischemia and hypoxia. Teleologically,
such a host-pathogen interaction may be explained by the
need of the pathogen to seek nutrient sources. In the case of
the saprophytic mould, the nutrient source would be decaying
organic tissue. Hence, as the available blood supply wanes in
an ischemic graft, the fungal invasion of the tissues increases.
Extending this line of reasoning, proangiogenic factors
upregulated in severe hypoxia such as HIF-1α may modulate
the invasive nature of the fungus. Although the role of HIF in
fungal pathogenesis is not well studied, it plays a key role in
the host’s innate immune response to bacterial microorganisms
[24-26]. Along these lines, Chlamydia has been demonstrated
to down-regulate HIF-1α in order to gain a virulence advantage
[26]. Currently, our research group is exploring the possibility
that HIF may be a potent modulator of A. fumigatus invasion.
Finally, we show that in vivo Aspergillus infection correlated
with decreases in blood perfusion of the anastomosis
compared with the midtrachea in allograft animals. Significant
differences in blood perfusion in the midtrachea and the donor￾recipient anastomosis were only observed in the allograft
animals at day 5 and 8 using the Doppler flowmetry probe. For
infected animals at day 12 and in non-infected allografts no
differences were observed. Similarly, in infected and non￾infected syngeneic transplants no differences were observed. A
lack of perfusion differences in syngeneic animals may be

explained by a lower rate of infection overall observed in
syngeneic compared to allogeneic animals (75% and 91%,
respectively), as well as a difference in invasive disease (17%
and 60%, respectively). Alternatively, syngeneic animals may
have a more robust vasculature due to a lack of alloimmune￾mediated vascular rejection [18]. Immune-mediated rejection
may make allogeneic transplants more susceptible to the
antiangiogenic or prothrombotic effects of the fungus. When
evaluated by FITC-lectin, no clear differences were discernible
between infected and non-infected animals. The difference
between the two types of perfusion assays may be accounted
for by the fact that FITC-lectin represents only a small portion
of the vessels that are perfused and is uniquely informative
about vessel architecture. By distinction, laser Doppler
flowmetry measures “red blood cell flux,” which equals the
product of the concentration of red blood cells moving in a
tissue volume (0.3 mm3
 to 0.75 mm3
) and the mean velocity of
these cells (www.oxford-optronix.com/pdfs/Technical/
LDFprinciples.pdf). Thus, laser Doppler flowmetry because it
measures a rate of red blood cell flow in a volume of tissue
equivalent to the diameter of the graft, represents a more
global and dynamic perfusion measurement of the tracheal
segment than does FITC-lectin. Grossly the FITC-lectin
perfusion studies did demonstrate marked dilation of
midtracheal vessels compared to the anastomosis a finding
that was consistent with the laser Doppler measurements.
It has been long recognized that A. fumigatus may modulate
the host’s microvasculature through vascular invasion,
thrombosis, and more recently through the production of
antiangiogenic factors [12,27]. Invasion of the vascular
endothelial lumen has been shown to increase the release of
tissue factor [27]. Tissue factor-mediated activation of the
clotting cascade has been implicated in the vascular
thrombosis that is well described in IPA [27]. Aspergillus￾mediated platelet activation may also contribute to
microvascular ischemia. RØdland et al., have demonstrated
that Aspergillus may induce the expression of membrane￾bound (CD63, CD26P) and soluble (RANTES, CD40L, DKK-1)
platelet activating factors, resulting in thrombosis [28].
Interestingly, DKK-1 also is a potent regulator of the Wnt
signaling pathway that plays a role in the regulation of
inflammation and angiogenesis [28]. Ben-Ami and colleagues
have shown that A. fumigatus produces a variety of
metabolites, including gliotoxin, that inhibit angiogenesis [12].
Although vascular occlusion is a well-known feature
radiographically and clinically, at present little is known of the
signaling pathways that drive the mould’s antiangiogenic
behavior.
In previous work, we demonstrated that microvascular
ischemia may be a diathesis for chronic rejection in lung
transplant recipients [13]. It is possible that bronchial artery
revascularization at the time of transplantation could limit the
development of chronic rejection, and, similarly, a positive role
for the bronchial circulation in maintaining the host defense
mechanism has been posited [13,15,18]. The clinical relevance
of our study could extend beyond lung transplantation to other
forms of Aspergillus lung disease. One important difference
among the patients that develop disparate forms of Aspergillus
lung diseases is the degree of airway ischemia related to an
abrupted bronchial circulation. For cystic fibrosis and asthmatic
patients, the bronchial arterial network is robust [15]. It is
speculated that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a
downstream mediator for HIF, may cause the hypervascularity
of the airways in asthmatics [29]. As predicted by our model, in
these patients A. fumigatus typically displays a non-invasive
phenotype. For a patient with COPD, in addition to architectural
destruction, there is a slowly progressive destruction of the
microvasculature and down regulation of VEGF [25,29]; in
these patients a more indolent invasive infection may occur,
chronic necrotizing aspergillosis. For lung transplant patients,
ischemia due to the failure to restore the bronchial circulation
may result in tracheal anastomotic infections early, and later,
with Aspergillus colonization and with progressive
microvascular loss associated with chronic rejection, in the
development of IPA. An increased understanding of the role of
the bronchial circulation in maintaining host defenses may
provide novel treatments such as bronchial artery restoration or
promotion of microvascular health and thus may possibly
ameliorate these infections.
Several limitations of the current study deserve mention. To
date, the literature hypothesizes that the mould itself drives
angioinvasion [25], whereas the results of our study suggest
that, in fact, the mould is responding to its microenvironment.
Although the current study cannot unequivocally delineate the
differential impact of the host or the pathogen, the overall
perfusion kinetics in the Doppler flowmetry and FITC-lectin
studies of both infected and non-infected allografts were
similar. If A. fumigatus were the driving force behind the
microvascular ischemia, we would have anticipated that that
the infected animals would have had lower perfusion at all time
points compared to non-infected allografts. Researchers also
have reported differential expression of genes associated with
angiogenesis and gliotoxin effects based on the type of
immune suppression used in the murine model (i.e.,
corticosteroid model versus a cyclophosphamide induced
neutropenic model) [12]. In the current study, mice were
immune suppressed with a single dose of triamcinolone on the
day of inoculation. Thus, the results of the current study may
not be generalizable to findings from other murine models that
typically administer corticosteroids at multiple time points or to
neutropenic models of IPA. Additionally, we anticipate that the
single dose of corticosteroid on the day of infection was
unlikely to dramatically impact the alloimmune reaction. If this
were the case, we would have anticipated changes in the
tissue oxygen kinetics, BPU or FITC-lectin studies, as we have
seen in our research group’s current work using immune
modulatory therapy [14].
In conclusion, the study demonstrates three main findings:
1.) A. fumigatus invasion increases with progressive airway
ischemia of the allograft, 2.) anastomotic infection
predominates regardless of the allogeneic or syngeneic status
of the transplant, route of infection or degree of airway
ischemia, and 3.) A. fumigatus infection correlated with regional
perfusion differences in the allogeneic transplanted trachea.
Future work is needed to delineate putative chemo-attractant
signals associated with angiogenesis that may explain A.

fumigatus tropism into ischemic areas. Additionally, the model
may allow delineation of the relative contribution of
antiangiogenic factors versus thrombotic factors and the
signaling pathways involved in modulating the host’s
microvascular health. Such studies may prevent the
occurrence or improve the treatment of Aspergillus-related lung
diseases.
