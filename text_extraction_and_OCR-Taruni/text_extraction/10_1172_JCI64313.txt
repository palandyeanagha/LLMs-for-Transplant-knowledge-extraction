Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is caused by mutations to PKD1 or PKD2, triggering 
progressive cystogenesis and typically leading to end-stage renal disease in midlife. The phenotypic spectrum, 
however, ranges from in utero onset to adequate renal function at old age. Recent patient data suggest that the 
disease is dosage dependent, where incompletely penetrant alleles influence disease severity. Here, we have 
developed a knockin mouse model matching a likely disease variant, PKD1 p.R3277C (RC), and have proved 
that its functionally hypomorphic nature modifies the ADPKD phenotype. While Pkd1+/null mice are normal, 
Pkd1RC/null mice have rapidly progressive disease, and Pkd1RC/RC animals develop gradual cystogenesis. These 
models effectively mimic the pathophysiological features of in utero–onset and typical ADPKD, respectively, 
correlating the level of functional Pkd1 product with disease severity, highlighting the dosage dependence 
of cystogenesis. Additionally, molecular analyses identified p.R3277C as a temperature-sensitive folding/
trafficking mutant, and length defects in collecting duct primary cilia, the organelle central to PKD patho￾genesis, were clearly detected for the first time to our knowledge in PKD1. Altogether, this study highlights 
the role that in trans variants at the disease locus can play in phenotypic modification of dominant diseases 
and provides a truly orthologous PKD1 model, optimal for therapeutic testing.
Introduction
Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD [MIM no. 
173900 for PKD1 and 613095 for PKD2]) is one of the most com￾mon monogenic disorders, with a prevalence of 1:400 to 1:1,000 
(1, 2). It is genetically heterogeneous and has been linked to 2 loci, 
PKD1 (16p13.3) and PKD2 (4q21), mutated in approximately 85% 
and 15% of cases, respectively (3–5). Typically, the disease mani￾fests with progressive bilateral cystic kidney enlargement, leading 
to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in midlife; while, symptomatic 
polycystic liver disease, hypertension, and an enhanced level of 
intracranial aneurysms are other disease complications (6, 7).
The pathogenesis underlying the polycystic kidney disease 
(PKD) phenotypes is still unclear; however, various cellular defects 
have been suggested. For example, cyst development has been 
strongly associated with defects to the primary cilia, as evident 
from model systems and syndromic PKD forms, categorizing 
PKD as a ciliopathy (8, 9). Structural and functional cilia defects, 
including length abnormalities, have been characterized in several 
types of PKD, including the infantile onset autosomal recessive 
form (ARPKD, MIM no. 263200) (8–12). However, no clear ciliary 
structural abnormalities have been described in PKD1 (13–15). 
The majority of ciliogenes appear to maintain the structural 
integrity of the cilia or regulate protein trafficking to and from 
the organelle, while the PKD1 and PKD2 proteins, polycystin-1 
(PC-1) and polycystin-2 (PC-2), respectively, are thought to form 
a complex on the primary cilium and act as a receptor (14, 16–19). 
One possibility is that the PC complex acts as a mechanosensor, 
signaling via a Ca2+ influx through PC-2, a TRP channel, after fluid 
flow detection by PC-1 (14, 16, 20). Additionally, urinary exosome￾like vesicles (ELVs), which contain high levels of the polycystins, 
have been suggested to play a role in the mediation of signaling 
events at the primary cilia (11, 21, 22). However, the localization 
and function of PC-1 and PC-2 are still controversial, and various 
alternative cilia-related roles have been proposed (16, 23–26).
In addition to primary cilia defects, PKD cells exhibit many other 
cellular aberrations proposed to be associated with cystogenesis 
and/or cyst progression. These defects include, but are not limited 
to, dedifferentiation, increased proliferation and apoptosis, polarity 
defects, and altered gene expression that may be linked to increased 
intracellular cAMP, possibly associated with decreased intracellular 
Ca2+ (16, 27). The tubule segment that becomes cystogenic is also 
a point of debate in ADPKD. Traditionally, all tubule segments 
have been thought to be involved in disease, but the available data 
are limited and somewhat contradictory (28–30). Recently, treat￾ments focused on lowering cAMP by targeting the arginine V2 vaso￾pressin receptor (AVPR2), which is mainly expressed in the thick 
ascending limb of Henle and the collecting duct (CD), highlight 
the importance of clarifying this issue for the development of suc￾cessful therapeutic interventions (28, 31, 32). Unfortunately, the 
currently available PKD1 rodent models are not ideal for the anal￾ysis of ADPKD pathogenesis, including determining the affected 
nephron segment or therapeutic testing. Pkd1-null animals die 
embryonically, and heterozygotes develop only very mild disease in 
old age, while conditional models do not reflect the disease devel￾opment in human ADPKD due to the loss of all functional protein 
at one time (33–39). In addition, previously described hypomorphic 
mouse models develop very rapidly progressive disease, which is 
inadequate for therapeutic testing and does not reflect the gradual 
kidney enlargement typical of ADPKD (40, 41).

The severity of disease in ADPKD has been directly associated 
with the gene mutated; PKD1 on average leads to ESRD at approx￾imately 54 years, while PKD2 leads to ESRD at approximately 74 
years (42). The complete phenotypic spectrum, however, ranges 
from rare in utero–onset cases to patients with adequate renal 
function in old age; extreme heterogeneity that cannot be solely 
explained by genic effects (6, 43, 44). Some rare cases with ear￾ly-onset ADPKD also develop tuberous sclerosis due to a contig￾uous deletion of PKD1 and TSC2 (MIM no. 600273), highlighting 
TSC2 as a likely modifier of the PKD1 phenotype (45–47). Causes 
of extreme intrafamilial phenotypic variation include mosaicism 
or bilineal inheritance of a pathogenic PKD1 and PKD2 variant, 
but these do not account for the majority of cases with extreme 
ADPKD phenotypes (45, 48, 49).
The mechanism by which a heterozygous mutation results in cyst 
development is controversial (50). Complete loss of the ADPKD 
proteins in mice results in embryonic lethality and renal cyst devel￾opment by E14.5 (33, 35, 51). Likewise, the corresponding human 
genotype is thought to be incompatible with life (52). One proposed 
mechanism, consistent with cyst development in null animals and 
the focal nature of cystogenesis, is a cellular recessive one, where each 
cyst is a clonal development resulting from complete polycystin loss. 
Somatic mutations to the WT PKD1 or PKD2 allele in individual 
cyst linings support this 2-hit mechanism, while the frequency and 
timing of this inactivation may explain some of the observed vari￾able expressivity (53–56). Consistent with this, a Pkd2 allele prone to 
somatic recombination results in progressive cystic disease, and PKD 
severity in conditional ADPKD mice differs radically depending on 
the age at complete polycystin inactivation (36–38, 57).
Although the cellular recessive mechanism is attractive, recent 
data indicate that the dosage level of the polycystins may be 
important. Homozygous Pkd1 and Pkd2 hypomorphs, with 13% 
to 33% correctly spliced Pkd1 or Pkd2, are viable but develop pro￾gressive cystic disease in the kidney, liver, and pancreas, despite the 
presence of some functional polycystin (40, 41, 58). Additionally, 
recently described atypical ADPKD families highlight the role of 
putative incompletely penetrant PKD1 or PKD2 alleles. If inherited 
alone, these alleles are associated with mild PKD, while homozy￾gotes or compound heterozygotes are viable and present with typ￾ical to severe disease, and in trans inheritance with a null allele 
causes in utero–onset disease (29, 59–62). However, proving the 
importance of specific alleles and analyzing the molecular mecha￾nism is not possible from the study of a number of small families.
Here, we have taken an experimental approach by developing a 
knockin mouse model of a clinically proposed incompletely pen￾etrant PKD1 allele, p.R3277C (RC), to rigorously test a dose-de￾Figure 1

pendent pathomechanism of cystogenesis and to investigate the 
role of these alleles in severe ADPKD. Furthermore, by generating 
models mimicking the pathophysiological features of typical and 
in utero–onset ADPKD, we have been able to study the process of 
cystogenesis in detail at the histological and molecular level, pro￾viding insights into pathogenesis and reagents to improve thera￾peutic options for this disorder.
Results
Generation of a knockin mouse model mimicking a clinical PKD1 allele. 
The PKD1 p.R3277C allele was first identified in a consanguineous 
family of French ancestry in the United States, in which patients 
homozygous for the allele were viable but presented with mild to 
typical cystic disease (59). In 2 additional families with extreme 
intrafamilial disease variability, this allele segregated in trans with 
either a truncating or missense mutation, both resulting in very ear￾ly-onset ADPKD (29, 59). These associated phenotypes suggested 
that the p.R3277C allele was incompletely penetrant. To date, 7 
pedigrees (2 homozygous) have been identified with this variant, 
giving an ADPKD population allele frequency of 0.25% (ADPKD 
database [PKDB]; http://pkdb.mayo.edu). To rigorously test the role 
of such alleles in the variable expressivity of PKD1, we generated 
a knockin mouse model mimicking the exact codon usage seen in 
patients (Pkd1 c.9805.9807AGA>TGC). The targeting construct was 
cloned from a 129Sv/E phage library using recombineering (Figure 
1A and ref. 63). Embryonic stem cell (ESC) clones were screened for 
homologous recombination (HR) by Southern blotting, and the 
mutation was verified by Sanger sequencing (Figure 1, B and C). To 
exclude effects of the loxP-flanked puromycin selection cassette, all 
male germline transmitting chimeras were crossed with an oocyte￾expressing Cre female (129S1/Sv-Hprttm1(cre)Mnn/J) to excise the selec￾tion cassette at the zygote stage. Subsequent RT-PCR analysis of 
the kidneys from homozygous animals (Pkd1RC/RC animals) showed 
no alteration in mRNA splicing or expression levels (Figure 1D). 
Likewise, PC-1 expression was unaltered between WT and Pkd1RC/RC
animals when analyzing kidney whole cell lysates or kidney-derived 
CD cells (in kidney, PC-1 expression in Pkd1RC/RC was 94% ± 2.30% of 
WT, P = 0.450; in CD cells, PC-1 expression in Pkd1RC/RC was 99% ± 
2.30% of WT, P = 0.605; Figure 1E). This suggested that the defect in 
the action of this allele was likely at the level of functional protein.
Mice homozygous for the Pkd1 p.R3277C allele develop mild but pro￾gressive PKD. We first set out to characterize the Pkd1 p.R3277C 
allele in homozygosity (Figures 2 and 3, Supplemental Figure 
1, and Supplemental Table 1; supplemental material available 
online with this article; doi:10.1172/JCI64313DS1), mimicking 
the published consanguineous family with adult-onset ADPKD 
(59). From a heterozygous cross, we observed the expected Men￾delian ratios of offspring (data not shown), implying that Pkd1

p.R3277C is not a fully penetrant allele. To analyze disease presen￾tation and progression, we initially followed 4 WT and 6 Pkd1RC/RC
littermates by ultrasonography (US). At 3 months of age, cysts 
ranging from 0.3 to 2.5 mm in diameter were visible in all Pkd1RC/RC
animals (Figure 2A). Kidney volumes (KVs) were estimated from 
3D M-mode renderings, and it was determined that Pkd1RC/RC
KVs increased progressively over time in most animals and were 
significantly increased compared with those of WT littermates at 
all investigated time points (Figure 2B and Supplemental Table 1); 
although, there was noticeable variability between these outbred 
animals (Figure 2B; e.g., animal no. 3 vs. no. 6). The increase in KV 
was directly correlated with the progressive but variable increase 
in cyst burden seen histologically at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months (Figure 
3A and Supplemental Figure 1) and reflected in a steady increase 
in percentage of kidney weight per body weight (%KW/BW) (Fig￾ure 2C and Supplemental Table 1). At 12 months of age, we noted 
a slight decrease in KV and %KW/BW, which was likely associ￾ated with increased fibrosis (3.3% of kidney area at 3 months vs. 
20.3% at 12 months; Table 1), highlighted by increased Masson 
Trichrome staining (Figure 3A and Supplemental Figure 1). A 
similar decrease in %KW/BW associated with increased fibrosis 
has been observed at earlier ages in other hypomorphic Pkd1 mod￾els and in late stages of human ADPKD (40, 41, 64). This steady 
increase in fibrosis seems mainly to correlate with cyst growth, 
although some fibrosis is evident when there is minimal cystogen￾esis. A number of factors, including epithelial paracrine release of

of Pkd1RC/RC and WT kidneys at 
1 to 12 months show that cysts 
developed progressively with age. 
At later time points, an increased 
level of fibrosis was noted (12 
months; Table 1). Scale bars: 1 mm 
(kidney cross-section, WT, and 
Pkd1RC/RC); 250 μm (Pkd1RC/RC
magnified region [images in sec￾ond column]); 200 μm (WT mag￾nified region [insets]). (B) Masson

12-month-old Pkd1RC/RC and WT 
livers (no significant difference 
between percentage of liver weight 
[LW] per body weight [%LW/BW] of 
WT animals and homozygotes was 
noted). Four out of five homozy￾gous animals showed ductal plate 
malformations, including micro￾hamartomas of varying severity. 
These cystic lesions are progeni￾tors of the liver cysts often found 
in patients with ADPKD (69). Scale 
bars: 100 μm.

area of cysts originating from the distal tubule (PNA) or the loop of Henle (THP) was consistently below 1% and was not included in the calculations.

proinflammatory and profibrotic mediators, epithelial produc￾tion of extracellular matrix proteins, and epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition, likely promote the fibrosis (65).
Analysis of the onset of cystogenesis showed that the Pkd1RC/RC
animals had histologically visible cysts as early as E16.5 (Supplemen￾tal Figure 2). This compares with approximately E14.5 in Pkd1null/null
mice and highlights that, although these animals are viable, the time 
of cyst initiation is not radically different from that in the null state 
(35, 51). Renal cystic enlargement was accompanied by an increase in 
renal cAMP, significant after 6 months, as described in other rodent 
models and patients with ADPKD (Figure 2D and refs. 16, 39, 66, 
67). Additionally, increasing kidney damage, presumably due to 
both the development and expansion of cysts and fibrosis (Table 1), 
caused a measurable decline in kidney function, detected by a rise in 
blood urea nitrogen (BUN) above the physiological range (18.6–32.9 
mg/dl) by 9 months (Figure 2E and refs. 66–68). Further, histological 
analysis showed that at 12 months most Pkd1RC/RC animals developed 
multiple ductal plate malformations, seen as microhamartomas 
(Figure 3B). These cystic lesions have been reported previously in 
Pkd1+/null animals, are characteristic of human ADPKD, and are the 
progenitors of the liver cysts found in the majority of patients (34, 
69). Pkd1RC/+ animals did not develop any renal cysts, have any sig￾nificant differences in renal function from WT, or develop any liver 
phenotype by 1 year of age (data not shown).
This analysis of homozygous animals showed that the Pkd1
p.R3277C allele is pathogenic, as all analyzed animals developed 
PKD, dismissing the notion that it may be one of the many silent, 
nonsynonymous variants detected in PKD1 (PKDB, http://pkdb.
mayo.edu). On the other hand, the viability of the homozygotes 
showed that the allele is not fully penetrant, proving for the first 
time to our knowledge the existence of incompletely penetrant 
PKD1 alleles and highlighting their role as a disease modifier.
The Pkd1 p.R3277C allele modifies the Pkd1+/null phenotype to ear￾ly-onset disease. To directly test the proposed modifier role of Pkd1
p.R3277C and to mimic the genotype associated with human in 
utero–onset disease, we crossed Pkd1RC/+ animals with a well-estab￾lished Pkd1-null model, Pkd1+/del2 (Figures 4 and 5, Supplemen￾tal Figure 3, Supplemental Table 2, and refs. 51, 59). Again, we 
observed the expected Mendelian ratios of offspring (data not 
shown), but in this case the progression of disease was much more 
aggressive. Pkd1RC/del2 animals showed enlarged kidneys by P1, 
visible from gross anatomy, and a significantly greater %KW/BW 
compared with that of WT littermates (3.05% vs. 1.29%; Figure 4, A 
and C, and Supplemental Table 2). The %KW/BW increased rapidly 
from approximately 3% at P1 to approximately 25% at P25. In com￾parison, the %KW/BW at P1 of Pkd1RC/del2 animals was significantly 
higher than that of homozygous animals at 3 months (P = 0.01). 
At the histological level, cysts were visible as early as E15.5, and 
both the number and size of cysts increased in an exponential fash￾ion to at least P25 (Figure 5, Figure 6B, Table 1, and Supplemen￾tal Figures 2 and 3). Interestingly, multiple glomerular cysts were 
detectable at the early time points, highlighting a clear similarity 
with human in utero–onset ADPKD (Figure 5, insets, and refs. 59, 
70). The rapidly expansive PKD was also associated with premature 
death, first noted at P20, and with a median survival at P28; 80% 
of animals were dead by P50 (Figure 4B). The cause of death was

likely associated with renal failure, as indicated by marked renal 
cystic enlargement (70.2% of kidney area by P25; Table 1), increased 
fibrotic index (24.2% by P25; Figure 5 and Table 1), and uremia 
evident by a significant increase in BUN at P12 (Figure 4D and 
Supplemental Table 2). Animals surviving beyond P25 exhibited 
further evidence of disease progression with significantly elevated 
BUN levels (~178 mg/dl [P25] vs. ~314 mg/dl [P180], P = 0.006; 
Supplemental Table 2) and a decline in %KW/BW, which is likely 
associated with an increase in fibrotic tissue (~25% [P25] vs. ~9% 
[P180]; Figure 4A, Figure 5, and Supplemental Table 2), as with the 
Pkd1RC/RC mice at 12 months. The reason that approximately 20% 
of animals survived much longer is unclear, but it is of note that 
this outbred population had milder disease during the explosive 
cyst expansion period (P12–P25), suggesting a less critical role for 
PC-1 during adulthood. Consistent with a dosage-dependent dis￾ease mechanism, Pkd1RC/del2 animals had a much more rapid rise in 
cAMP, with P1 mice having higher cAMP levels than 12-month-old 
Pkd1RC/RC mice (P = 0.0042) and BUN levels above the physiological 
average as early as P18 (Figure 2; Figure 4, D and E; Supplemental 
Tables 1 and 2; and ref. 68). In addition, Pkd1RC/del2 animals pre￾sented with osteopenia and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), 
known extrarenal phenotypes observed in other Pkd1 models and 
patients with ADPKD (Supplemental Figure 4 and refs. 71–73). 
A decrease in trabecular and cortical bone mass was observed in 
Pkd1RC/del2 males and females at P25, likely correlating with reduced 
PC-1 function in osteoblasts, but possibly also associated with sec￾ondary hyperparathyroidism (Supplemental Figure 4A, data on 
females not shown, and refs. 71, 72). Heart weight was also signifi￾cantly increased, with the myocardium of the left ventricle signifi￾cantly thickened (Supplemental Figure 4B) and evidence of LVH, 
possibly due to hypertension in the P25 Pkd1RC/del2 animals with 
advanced cystic disease. No intracranial aneurysms were noted.
This compound heterozygous model clearly demonstrates the role 
of Pkd1 p.R3277C as a modifying allele. The Pkd1+/del2 mice did not 
exhibit an ADPKD phenotype, lacking renal cysts and functional 
changes in kidneys at 1 year of age (data not shown), contrasting 
dramatically with the rapid disease progression in Pkd1RC/del2 ani￾mals (51). These data prove that in trans inheritance of a null and 
this incompletely penetrant allele, without the requirement of other 
genetic events, results in early-onset ADPKD, suggesting a clear dos￾age pathomechanism of cyst initiation and/or progression.
Pkd1 p.R3277C mice show a switch in tubular cyst origin correspondent 
with age and an increase in proliferation. The models described here 
developed cysts due to a consistent reduction of PC-1, compared 
with conditional knockouts, in which only the segments engi￾neered to be null for PC-1 became cystic. Consequently, answer￾ing the question of where and when cysts develop in our model 
is relevant to human PKD1. Using immunofluorescence (IF) 
markers for each tubule segment (lotus tetragonolobus aggluti￾nin [LTA] – proximal tubule [PT], peanut agglutinin [PNA] – dis￾tal tubule, Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein [THP] – loop of Henle, 
and Dolichos biflorus agglutinin [DBA] – CD), we examined the 
cystic origin throughout disease development. In Pkd1RC/del2 ani￾mals at P1, 82% of cysts were of PT and 17% of cysts were of CD 
origin. However, by P25, these animals had only 6% PT and 76% 
CD cysts. Interestingly, by this time point, 18% of cysts (16% of 
kidney area) could not be recognized by any of the tubule mark￾ers used, including PNA and THP (Figure 6, A and B, and Table 
1), suggesting that they had become dedifferentiated. The switch 
in cyst origin was also noticeable when looking at cyst area rather 
than cyst number, with the area occupied by PT cysts falling from 
29.2% at P1 to 2.9% at P25. During the same period, CD cysts rose 
from 4.2% of kidney area to 51.3% (Table 1). In Pkd1RC/RC mice, a 
similar switch was observed; at P1, 90% of cysts were of PT and 8%

were of CD origin, while at 3 months, 76% were of CD and 15% 
were of PT origin (Figure 6, A and C, and Table 1). Interestingly, 
at 12 months of age, the percentage of PT cysts increased as com￾pared with that at 3 months, from 15% to 29%; however, most 
of the PT cysts corresponded to mildly dilated tubules, whereas 
the majority of larger cysts were either of CD origin (56%, 13.6% 
of area) or dedifferentiated (15%, 8.5% of area; Figure 6, A and C, 
and Table 1). The PT dilatation at this stage may reflect acquired 
renal cystic disease associated with advanced renal insufficiency 
as seen in human ADPKD (74, 75).
This analysis of both models shows a consistent shift in cyst 
origin, with a predominance of PT kidney cysts during kidney 
development, which continues in the mouse until approximately 2 
weeks postnatally, to a predominance of CD cysts once the kidney 
has fully developed (37). This is consistent with PT cysts predom￾inating in early-onset ADPKD cases, with a similar shift from PT 
to CD cysts associated with completion of kidney development in 
ARPKD (28, 29, 39, 76, 77). The observation that the majority of 
adult cysts are of CD origin correlates with the AVPR2 antagonists 
showing some benefit in ADPKD (31, 32, 78).
PCNA staining of CD tubules and cysts in P18 Pkd1RC/del2 ani￾mals highlighted that cyst expansion/size correlates with an 
increase in proliferation (Figure 7 and Supplemental Table 3). 
Proliferation was greatest in the largest cysts (5.50% vs. 3.09% 
in small cysts, P = 0.002), but, notably, even nondilated tubules 
showed increased proliferation compared with WT (1.71% vs.

occurred that became more promi￾nent after kidney development (P25,

0.94%, P = 0.009). The role of proliferation to cyst expansion 
in ADPKD is a controversial one, but when analysis is limited 
to tubular/cystic epithelia, increased cell division clearly occurs 
(36, 37, 79).
The Pkd1 p.R3277C allele is associated with elongated CD primary cilia. 
In syndromic forms of PKD, the mutated proteins are proposed to 
regulate ciliary protein trafficking and, hence, influence ciliogen￾esis; therefore, structural ciliary abnormalities, including length 
defects, have been associated with these diseases (8–10). However, 
in PKD1, the majority of studies have not detected cilia length 
defects, but the data are not conclusive, as these studies were 
largely conducted by light microscopy using cultured cells (14, 15, 
80, 81). To analyze whether PC-1 may have a role in ciliary mainte￾nance, we analyzed renal CD and bile duct cilia length using scan￾ning electron microscopy (SEM). Cilia of nondilated and cystic 
CDs were significantly longer in P25 Pkd1RC/del2 animals (mean = 
4.98 μm) and 12-month-old Pkd1RC/RC animals (mean = 3.02 μm) 
compared with those in WT controls (mean = 1.98 μm; Figure 8A 
and Supplemental Table 4 [WT vs. Pkd1RC/del2, P = 0.0012; WT vs. 
Pkd1RC/RC, P = 5.65 × 10–4]), with a significant difference between 
Pkd1RC/del2 mice and their homozygous counterparts (P = 0.0066). 
Interestingly, these length defects were not related to cystic dilata￾tion, since measurements in cystic and noncystic CDs in both ani￾mal models did not significantly differ (Supplemental Table 4). 
Furthermore, this observation was independent of age, since the 
length of WT cilia did not change from P25 to 12 months of age 
(Supplemental Table 4). Cilia within normal bile ducts did not 
vary significantly between genotypes (Figure 8B, Supplemental 
Table 5, and ref. 79). However, bile duct cilia were elongated in 1 
microhamartoma that was found by SEM (P = 1.49 × 10–6; Figure 
8B and Supplemental Table 5). Therefore, within the kidney, the 
dosage dependence of cilia length abnormality indicates that the 
level of functional PC-1 is directly associated with the observed 
ciliary defect, whereas in the liver, cilia elongations seem related 
to bile duct abnormalities.
The Pkd1 p.R3277C allele alters PC-1 cleavage and folding/maturation. 
PC-1 is a multidomain glycoprotein that is cleaved at a G protein–
coupled receptor proteolytic site (GPS; Figure 9A and refs. 82, 83). 
After cleavage, the N-terminal product (NTP) and the C-terminal 
product (CTP) are thought to remain tethered and functionally 
act together (Figure 9A and ref. 83). It has also been reported that 
endogenous PC-1 is observed as 2 distinct glycoforms, endogly￾cosidase H–resistant (EndoH-resistant) (NTP**) and -sensitive 
(NTP*) forms (84). This implies a difference in protein trafficking 
of these glycoforms, as EndoH resistance is obtained in the trans￾Golgi, in which high-mannose oligosaccharides are converted to 
complex saccharides by the addition of N-acetylglucosamine to 
form secreted or membrane-bound, mature, forms of the protein 
(85). We confirmed these findings by Western blot (WB) analysis of 
kidney membrane protein with 2 products found in the untreated 
sample, one being the EndoH stable form (no shift in size [NTP**]), 
and the other being the sensitive form that reduces in size upon 
EndoH treatment (loss of all N-linked glycosylation [NTP*]; Fig￾ure 9B). Treatment with peptide-N-Glycosidase F (PNGaseF), an 
enzyme that removes all N-linked sugars independent of matura￾tion status, reduced the size of the 2 products to that of the EndoH￾sensitive form, showing that the difference in size of the 2 untreated 
products is only due to variable glycosylation status. Analysis of 
urinary ELVs, showed that it is the EndoH-resistant PC-1 that is 
present in these vesicles (Figure 9B and refs. 21, 22). Comparison 
of ELV PC-1 with an exogenously expressed PC-1 GPS cleavage 
mutant (E2771K; Figure 9A) showed that the PNGaseF-treated 
full-length PC-1 was much larger than the treated ELV product, 
indicating that only the cleaved product is found in ELVs (NTP**; 
Figure 9C). Also, only the cleaved product (NTP) was observed in 
kidney tissue preparations, consistent with the significance of this 
cleavage event for normal function (83).
To analyze the possible pathomechanism of Pkd1 p.R3277C, we 
first investigated whether the allele altered PC-1 cleavage by using 
an exogenously expressed C-terminally tagged PC-1 construct

(Figure 9A). WB using an antibody to the C-terminal V5 epitope 
tag highlighted significantly reduced levels of cleaved p.R3277C 
PC-1 compared with WT (~76% of WT, Figure 9D). However, 
we also tested a second suspected incompletely penetrant Pkd1
allele (p.R2220W) that was found in trans with PKD1 p.R3277C 
resulting in early-onset ADPKD, and this PC-1 product was far 
more resistant to cleavage (~26% of WT) (29). The p.R2220W 
variant is localized within the receptor for egg jelly domain (REJ), 
a domain previously shown to be important for GPS cleavage 
(83). These results suggested that inefficient cleavage may be a 
pathomechanism associated with some incompletely penetrant 
PC-1 alleles but may not be central to the reduced function of 
Pkd1 p.R3277C; hence, we investigated further possible mecha￾nisms. Since PKD1 p.R3277C is 2 amino acids from the second 
transmembrane domain (TMII; Figure 9A), we tested whether 
TMII integrates appropriately into the lipid bilayer in the pres￾ence of this missense change. Using exogenous expression of a 
partial PC-1 construct with a C-terminal glycosylation reporter, 
we assayed successful TMII integration. However, no noticeable 
difference in membrane integration ability was found compared 
with WT (Supplemental Figure 5).
Since the cleaved, mature PC-1 is found in urinary ELVs, it 
was possible to use urinary ELVs from WT and mutant mice to 
assay possible folding or trafficking defects. We isolated ELVs 
from a 12-hour urine collection of 1- and 12-month-old Pkd1RC/RC
mice and found from WB analysis that they had an approxi￾Figure 8

Pkd2WS25/– mice that have a similar level of cystogenesis as the ana￾lyzed Pkd1RC/RC mice showed unaltered levels of PC-1 NTP** com￾pared with WT mice, highlighting that the reduction in PC-1 in 
the Pkd1RC/RC mice is not due to the presence of cystic disease (57).

To confirm these findings in the kidney, we performed WB of 
kidney membrane preparations of 1-month-old littermates. Con￾sistent with the results from the urinary ELVs, Pkd1RC/RC animal 
kidneys showed a reduced level of the EndoH stable PC-1 NTP** 
compared with WT (Figure 9G).
These results suggested that the reduction of EndoH stable 
PC-1 p.R3277C may result from a maturation defect between 
the ER and the trans-Golgi or from a folding defect within the 
ER (85). To investigate a possible folding defect, primary cells 
isolated from Pkd1RC/RC kidney CDs were grown at a reduced 
temperature to create an environment more permissive for 
protein folding (33°C, compared with 37°C) (86). Indeed, the 
temperature shift increased the relative amount of the EndoH 
stable PC-1 glycoform in cellular ELVs to a level close to that 
in WT ELVs and significantly different from that at the higher 
temperature (Figure 9H, P = 0.00089 [Pkd1RC/RC, 33°C vs. 37°C], 
P = 0.00017 [37°C, WT vs. Pkd1RC/RC], P = 0.025 [33°C, WT vs. 
Pkd1RC/RC]). Consequently, we propose that the Pkd1 p.R3277C 
allele is a temperature-sensitive folding mutant. However, accu￾mulation of the mutant protein was not sufficient to trigger ER 
stress (Supplemental Figure 6). Therefore, due to the folding 
defect (and reduced cleavage), p.R3277C results in an approxi￾mately 60% reduction of mature PC-1 in Pkd1RC/RC mice.
Discussion
In this study, we set out to understand the etiology and patho￾mechanism associated with the phenotypic heterogeneity of 
PKD1, which at its extremes ranges from mild PKD in old age 
without renal insufficiency to in utero lethality (6, 43, 44). Emerg￾ing family data suggested that in trans inheritance of a null and 
an incompletely penetrant PKD1 allele could result in the devas￾tating early-onset phenotype (29, 59–61). To rigorously test this 
theory, we developed and characterized a knockin mouse model 
mimicking a naturally occurring PKD1 variant, p.R3277C, high￾lighted by recent family studies (29, 59). Mirroring the human 
studies, Pkd1RC/RC animals developed gradual cystic disease over 1 
year, while Pkd1RC/null mice had rapidly progressive disease, prov￾ing the significance of this combination of alleles. This simple 
pathomechanism is consistent with the description by Zerres (43), 
nearly 20 years ago, of a high recurrence risk of severe disease in 
siblings of an early-onset case in families with otherwise typical 
ADPKD. Data from a handful of additional families, highlighting 
other possible incompletely penetrant alleles, indicate a broader 
applicability, but studies of larger populations and better defini￾tion of these alleles are needed to determine the full importance of 
in trans inheritance to explaining early-onset disease (29, 59–62). 
Indeed, other mechanisms, such as modifier loci beyond the dis￾ease gene and environmental factors, also significantly influence 
disease variability. Early-onset severe ADPKD has been linked to 
contiguous deletion of PKD1 and TSC2 as well as co-inheritance 
of a PKD1 and a HNF1B or PKHD1 allele, highlighting the fact 
that digenic inheritance may account for some of the phenotypic 
variability seen in ADPKD (45–47, 62). Further, 3 SNPs in DKK3
have been associated with severity of renal disease in a candidate 
gene association study, while nongenetic factors, such as male 
hormones, caffeine, and smoking, have been suggested as risk 
factors in ADPKD (87–89). Careful analysis is now required to 
determine the significance of each of these elements with respect 
to disease severity and to identify other genetic and environmen￾tal disease modifiers.
Insights from our model systems into the etiology of in utero 
ADPKD and the functional analysis of the mutant PC-1 pro￾vide further clues to the underlying pathomechanism of typical 
ADPKD. Although cystogenesis is often considered a cellular 
recessive process, in our case both the Pkd1RC/RC and Pkd1RC/del2 ani￾mals have a Pkd1 mutation to both alleles, making it unlikely that 
a somatic Pkd1 mutation is required for cyst initiation. Instead, it 
seems more plausible that the dosage of PC-1 is underlying disease 
severity, and, by expression analysis of PC-1 in ELVs (an abundant 
site of polycystin expression that is readily isolated), we have pre￾cisely quantified the levels of mature protein associated with pro￾gressive adult disease (~40% in Pkd1RC/RC) and inferred a level of 
mature protein associated with rapidly progressive, early-onset dis￾ease (approximately 20% in Pkd1RC/del2 and ref. 21). Hence, it seems 
reasonable to propose that ADPKD severity is directly related to 
PC-1 dosage; adult-onset disease is usually caused by a 50% PC-1 
reduction (haploinsufficiency), while further reductions due to 
variants on the “normal” allele cause severe early-onset presen￾tations. The progressive PKD associated with transgenic miRNA 
reduction of Pkd1 by 60% to 70% is consistent with the dosage 
model presented here (90). Although, there is strong evidence of a 
second-hit mechanism, with detected somatic mutations in large 
cysts, we propose that they are not necessary for cyst initiation and 
instead may play a role in cyst progression by providing cysts a 
growth or survival advantage (53–56).
The combination of a dosage pathomechanism in ADPKD 
and the realization that variants of the disease gene inherited 
from the “normal” parent can significantly influence the PKD1 
phenotype have profound implications for understanding the 
variable expressivity of ADPKD. We have focused on extreme 
early-onset disease through co-inheritance of an incompletely 
penetrant and fully penetrant allele, but some alleles may have 
a lesser effect on the level of functional PC-1 and result in less 
extreme effects, such as ESRD in early adulthood. While efforts 
to identify genetic modifiers of the PKD1 phenotype through 
genome-wide association studies and exome or whole-genome 
sequencing are underway, it seems plausible that variants to the 
“normal” PKD1 allele are a major disease modifier and that com￾plex allelic inheritance is relevant more generally to the variable 
expressivity of ADPKD. Hence, better classification of variants 
with incompletely penetrant potential will be of increasing prog￾nostic value. Further, it seems likely that this pathomechanism 
is important to the phenotypic variability of other haploinsuffi￾cient, dominant diseases, although the large array of “normal” 
variants cataloged at PKD1 indicate that it may be an extreme 
example (PKDB, http://pkdb.mayo.edu) (91, 92).
Our models not only allow the genetic mechanism of disease 
to be analyzed but also provide insight into the pathophysiol￾ogy. We have shown that increased proliferation is an important 
factor in cyst expansion. Of further interest, in both models cyst 
initiation occurred embryonically (E15.5–E16.5), but PKD devel￾oped much more quickly in the model with the lower level of 
PC-1. It is not known whether this dosage difference influences 
the rate of cyst initiation or expansion, but in this study, it seems 
that dosage may be relevant in both instances. Previous compar￾isons of PKD1 and PKD2 concluded that it was the rate of cyst 
initiation rather than rate of expansion that makes PKD1 more 
severe (88). Interestingly, analysis of conditional Pkd1 models 
showed that PKD severity altered radically depending upon the 
time of gene inactivation, with a tipping point between rapid and

tory, and since conditional models lose all functional PC-1 at one 
time, with the affected kidney segment dictated by the Cre pro￾moter, they do not reflect human disease development. Previously 
described hypomorphic models have approximately 70% to 80% 
PC-1 reduction, leading to very rapid disease with high levels of 
fibrosis early in life, similar to our approximately 80%-reduction 
model (Pkd1RC/del2), and thus leaving a short therapeutic window 
(40, 41). Our 60%-reduction model (Pkd1RC/RC) appears to best 
mimic human ADPKD (over a shorter timescale) with a 9-month 
progressive expansion and then a slight reduction in KV associated 
with fibrosis as ESRD approaches (101). Other similarities include 
those observed physiologically, with increased cAMP and elevation 
of BUN indicating renal insufficiency after 9 months, and histo￾logically, with progressive cyst development and expansion, and a 
switch from PT to CD cysts following renal development. The tem￾perature-sensitive nature of p.R3277C suggests that interventions 
to promote more efficient folding of PC-1 may increase the level of 
functional protein. This indicates that, in addition to the current 
experimental therapies that focus on cAMP and other signaling 
defects, chaperone-enhancing or proteasome-inhibiting strategies 
may also be effective in a subset of patients with missense muta￾tions to PKD1 or PKD2 (102, 103). Last, a dosage model of ADPKD 
suggests that approaches to increase the level of the normal PKD1
(PKD2) allele in patients with typical ADPKD, even by a modest 
amount, could have a dramatic clinical benefit.
Methods
Generation of the knockin construct. The targeting template for the Pkd1
p.R3277C (murine Pkd1 p.R3269C) knockin construct was obtained from a 
129/Sv genomic phage library, using a cDNA probe spanning exons 19–23. 
The identified phage (11.1 kb, Pkd1 IVS16-IVS34) was cloned into pZErO-2TM.
oligo.PGK-TK (pZErO-2TM plus oligo [PacI, SbfI, MfeI] plus thymidine kinase 
gene). A β-lactamase expression cassette flanked with a 3′ SalI site was recom￾bineered into IVS30, using the DY380 E. coli strain (63). The intronic position 
of the cassette was assessed (ASD Intron Analysis and ESEfinder 3.0) to min￾imize the possibility of disrupting spliceosome binding sites or the branch 
point. The mutation and the loxP-flanked puromycin cassette were intro￾duced using a pZErO–2TM shuttle vector system (AhdI, XhoI, SalI polylinker). 
An amplified 129/Sv Pkd1 fragment, spanning from the AhdI site (IVS27) to 
the end of the β-lactamase cassette (XhoI; IVS30), was cloned into the shuttle 
vector, and Pkd1 p.R3277C was introduced using the Phusion Site-Directed 
Mutagenesis Kit (NEB) (29, 59). The loxP-flanked puromycin cassette, includ￾ing Southern blotting restrictions sites, was excised from pBS.DAT-Lox￾Stop and cloned into the shuttle vector using XhoI/SalI sites. The modified 
genomic sequence, including the loxP-flanked selection cassette, was excised 
from the shuttle vector (AhdI/SalI) and exchanged with the original sequence 
within the targeting construct (pZErO–2TM.PGK-TK) to generate the complete 
construct. The construct was linearized with PacI (Figure 1A).
Generation and genotyping of knockin mice. The targeting construct was 
electroporated into 129/Sv ESCs by the Mayo Gene Targeting Core as 
previously described (104). Successful HR was confirmed by Southern 
blotting using a 5′ (2.9 kb; exon 15) and 3′ probe (2.0 kb; exons 36–46; 
Figure 1A) and 1.5 μg of ESC DNA digested with either BspHI (5′ probe) 
or MfeI (3′ probe) (Figure 1A). ESC clones positive for HR were verified 
by sequencing and injected into blastocysts of pseudopregnant C57BL/6 
females. Germline transmission was obtained with 2 clones. All experi￾ments were performed on generation F3 animals (C57BL/6) from 1 clone 
(generation F2 was first crossed against the Cre-recombinase expressing 
line, 129S1/Sv-Hprttm1(cre)Mnn/J, to remove the selection cassette). Pkd1+/del2
was a fully congenic C57BL/6 line (51).
slow expansion of disease roughly corresponding to the comple￾tion of kidney development (37). Hence, developing tubules with 
high proliferative indices may be more sensitive to PC-1 reduc￾tion/loss. The rate of epithelial cell proliferation during devel￾opment may also explain the switch with completion of kidney 
development from predominately PT to CD cysts observed in 
our study and previously reported in human ADPKD (28–30). 
The proliferation of immature early tubules (S-shaped bodies) is 
very high and remains high throughout embryonic life (93). In 
later development, when the epithelium differentiates into neph￾ron segments recognizable by light microscopy, the proliferative 
index decreases substantially but remains elevated in the distal 
nephron and CD, whereas it becomes very low in the PT (93). In 
pediatric and adult kidneys, proliferative indices are very low 
in all tubular segments but remain higher in the CD compared 
with those in PT (94). Thus, the underlying rate of epithelial 
cell proliferation may explain both the increased susceptibility 
of the developing kidney to cystogenesis and the switch from 
predominantly PT to predominantly CD cysts. Understanding 
this switch is important, since theoretical considerations have 
highlighted that embryonic cysts, by growing at faster rates 
compared with cysts initiated later in life, contribute majorly to 
the total cyst burden (95).
A major argument for the 2-hit hypothesis is that the cyst 
development in ADPKD is focal, each the result of an individual 
somatic mutation (50). However, in the models presented here 
in which somatic mutations to the normal allele are not likely 
to be important, cyst development is still focal. This implies that 
a threshold model is important where stochastic factors, such 
as variation in the PC-1 expression level from cell to cell and 
so-called third hits (perhaps to be considered second hits now), 
such as renal damage or other factors triggering proliferation, 
may be key to driving a cell or segment of tubule into cystic 
transformation (96–98).
The role primary cilia play in ADPKD cystogenesis remains con￾troversial, with the majority of studies focused on downstream 
signaling defects (16). Little attention has been given to the struc￾tural appearance of ADPKD primary cilia, despite length and 
other structural defects detected in other PKD-related ciliopathies 
(8–15). Here, we report for the first time to our knowledge a clear 
PC-1 dosage-dependent increase in cilia length in normal and cys￾tic CDs. Increased cilia length has been associated with enhanced 
cAMP levels and injury/inflammation, the latter of which may be 
associated with the observed increase in cilia length within the 
microhamartoma; however, within the kidney, it is of interest that 
we observed the length increase independent of the cystogenic 
state of the tubule (80, 99, 100). This highlights a potential direct 
role of PC-1 in cilia maintenance. Alternatively, the length increase 
could be a compensatory response to reduced functional PC-1, 
extending the platform hosting the flow or ELV detector when less 
PC-1 is present. Furthermore, the clear description of the process￾ing of PC-1 into mature and immature EndoH forms presented 
here should stimulate further study of the localization of this large 
and complex protein. Here, we have shown that just the resistant 
form can be found in urinary ELVs; however, the glycoform found 
on primary cilia or the plasma membrane remains unknown (21).
One of the most valuable features of this study is likely the devel￾opment of new Pkd1 models, which are well suited for therapeutic 
testing in comparison with current models. As described in the 
Introduction, the present fully inactivating models are unsatisfac-

Biotechnology Inc. ) labeling was performed as indicated (11, 79), with 
secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor, Invitrogen) used at a 1:500 dilution. 
Cyst number and area were estimated using ImageJ software. A dilated 
tubule was counted as a cyst, if its area exceeded 0.02% of the total kidney 
area (~500 μm2, dependent on age). For cyst number, cysts were counted 
using the Analyze Particle/Cell Counter plug-in for ImageJ (Figure 6, B 
and C). For percentage of cyst area, the kidney area (medulla plus cortex) 
was measured, followed by measurement of the cyst area of individually 
stained or unstained cysts. Fibrotic area was measured using the Masson 
Trichrome section. All area calculations were preformed using the Ana￾lyze Particle (IF images) or the Measure and Label (Masson Trichrome) 
plug-in for ImageJ. Results were expressed as percentage of stained area 
per kidney area (Table 1). For PCNA analysis, the Axio Vision software 
was used (Figure 7). Single kidney cross sections from 3 nonlittermate 
mice were labeled and analyzed (consecutive sections from the same kid￾ney were used for each marker).
SEM. SEM imaging was performed on the left kidney and the right 
liver lobe as described previously (11, 79). CDs were identified based on 
known morphological features, and bile ducts were identified based on 
their proximity to a portal vein/hepatic artery (107). For kidney SEM, 
approximately 50 cilia were imaged from each WT animal (two P25 
animals and one 12-month-old animal), and cilia of cystic (~30; n > 6), 
dilated (~30; n > 6), and nondilated (~40; n > 10) CDs were imaged from 
each mutant animal (three P25 Pkd1RC/del2 animals and three 12-month￾old Pkd1RC/RC animals). For liver SEM, approximately 50 cilia from at least 
5 different bile ducts per animal were imaged from each genotype. In 
both cases, kidney and liver, genotype-blinded cilia length measurements 
were made with ImageJ software.
ELV isolation and whole kidney membrane/cell lysate preparation. Urinary 
ELVs were isolated as described previously (104). Three male and three 
female WT or Pkd1RC/RC animals were placed in metabolic cages for 12 
hours to collect 10 ml urine (overall experimental, n = 4). Isolation 
of urinary ELVs from the Pkd2WS25/null model as controls was possible 
because Stefan Somlo (Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecti￾cut, USA) provided us with the model. Cellular ELVs were similarly iso￾lated from primary CD cells grown in 20 ml (six 15-cm plates = 120 ml 
total) serum-free media for 3 days. Whole kidney membrane preps from 
1-month-old WT or Pkd1RC/RC animals were prepared as described pre￾viously (Figure 9, B and G, ref. 104). Whole kidney lysates were pre￾pared from 1-month-old WT or Pkd1RC/RC flash-frozen kidneys (n = 3) 
after homogenization with mortar and pestle followed by 18G, 21G, 
and 25G needle homogenization. The homogenate as well as CD cells 
(n = 3/group; Figure 1D and Supplemental Figure 4B) were lysed using 
RIPA buffer (Millipore).
Cleavage and membrane integration assay. The cleavage assay (n = 6) was per￾formed using a full-length Pkd1 construct with a C-terminal V5 tag (Figure 
9D). To introduce mutations, the fragment was shuttled into pZErO–2TM
(EcoRI/SacII). The membrane integration assay (n = 3) was modified from 
a previously described protocol using a PC-1 transmembrane glycosylation 
construct provided by Robin Maser (Clinical Laboratory Sciences, Univer￾sity of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas, USA; Supplemental 
Figure 5 and ref. 108). In both experiments, the Pkd1 variant was intro￾duced using the Phusion Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (NEB), and the 
WT and mutant constructs were transfected into HEK293T cells following 
manufacturer protocol (Polyfect, Qiagen). Cells were lysed 24 hours after 
transfection using RIPA buffer (Millipore).
Primary cell culture/temperature shift assay. Primary CD cells were harvested 
from 1-month-old WT and Pkd1RC/RC kidneys (2 animals per harvest, non￾littermates) as described previously (104), with the following modifica￾tions: after sieving the cells through 80-μm mesh, the flow through was 
Genotyping of all Pkd1 p.R3277C animals was performed by HinfI 
digest of a 719-bp PCR fragment spanning IVS27–exon 30. The 
p.R3277C mutation destroys the HinfI site (WT, 439 bp, 280 bp; Pkd1
p.R3277C, 719 bp). Pkd1+/del2 mice were provided by Shigeo Horie 
(Department of Urology, Teikyo University Hospital, Kanto/Tokyo, 
Japan) and genotyped using two separate PCR reactions, mutant 
(474 bp) and WT (380 bp).
RT-PCR analysis. RT-PCR analysis (n = 3) was performed on RNA iso￾lated from 1-month-old, flash-frozen WT and Pkd1RC/RC kidneys (Figure 
1C), from left tibias of P25 WT and Pkd1RC/del2 males (Supplemental 
Figure 4A, tibias were sonicated in 200 μl TRIzol before RNA isola￾tion), or from cultured CD cells isolated from 1-month-old WT and 
Pkd1RC/RC kidneys (Supplemental Figure 6). RNA was isolated using the 
Qiagen RNeasy Kit, and RT was performed with the SuperScript III RT 
Kit (Invitrogen).
For Pkd1 cDNA analysis, exons 27–33 were amplified (762 bp or 669 bp, 
splice variant skipping exon 31; ref. 105). RT analysis of osteocalcin, Runx2, 
and Gapdh was performed as previously described (71). RT analysis of ER 
stressors was performed using primers to the murine mRNA (Hspa5, 335 
bp; Herpud1, 301 bp; Xbp1, 205 bp; Actb: 397 bp). Fragments were quanti￾fied using ImageJ software.
Histological analysis. Animals were sacrificed by carbon dioxide expo￾sure (Mayo IACUC guidelines) prior to organ harvest, and body/organ 
weights were recorded. Histology of 4% paraformaldehyde–fixed tis￾sue was processed and H&E/Masson trichrome stained by the Mayo 
Department of Pathology. All tissues were examined by an experienced 
pathologist (S.H. Nasr). Kidneys (right), livers, pancreata, hearts, lungs, 
spleens, testes, and brains were analyzed from P25 and P180 Pkd1RC/del2
animals and 12-month-old Pkd1RC/RC animals. At all other time points, 
only kidneys were reviewed. At each time point, a minimum of 6 animals 
(3 per gender) were reviewed. Slides were observed using ×5 and ×10 
objectives (Zeiss AxioObserver, Carl Zeiss). In cases in which the size 
of the histological section exceeded the visual field, single images were 
fused (AxioVision software).
US and KV measurements. US analysis of the right kidneys from WT (2 
females, 2 males) and Pkd1RC/RC mice (3 females, 3 males) at 3, 6, 9, and 
12 months was performed as described previously (106) with the follow￾ing modifications: 40-MHz scan head, 3D step size of 0.05 mm, and focal 
depth of 0.09 mm. KV calculations were performed by reconstructing a 3D 
image of kidney traces at a step size of 0.5 mm (VisualSonics software). A 
mean of 2 KV measurements was recorded. No cysts were found in Pkd1RC/+
animals at 12 months.
BUN/cAMP measurements. Blood plasma was separated (6,000 g, 15 
minutes at 4°C) from blood isolated by cardiac puncture and used for 
the BUN assay (BUN-Urea, BioAssay Systems), and cAMP levels (Direct 
cAMP EIA Kit, ENZO) were measured from 100 to 200 mg of flash￾frozen kidney (left). Both assays were performed following the manu￾facturer’s protocol.
Micro-CT analysis. Micro-CT was performed on the right femurs of 3 P25 
WT and Pkd1RC/del2 males using the μCT35 system (Scanco Medical) at the 
Mayo Bone Histomorphometry Core. The femur was oriented along the 
rotational axis of the scanner in a 70-kVP/180-mAs x-ray tube and scanned 
at an integration time of 300 ms. Sections were taken at an element size of 
0.007 mm (trabecular bone, 233 sections; cortical bone, 50 sections). Corti￾cal percentage of bone volume/tissue volume (%BV/TV) was determined by 
tracing the bone outline of all 50 sections. The %BV/TV values are the mean 
of duplicate measurements.
IF labeling. Tissues were prepared for IF labeling as previously described 
(10). Biotinylated-LTA, -DBA, and -PNA (1:250, Vector Laboratories); TH 
(1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.); and PCNA (1:100, Santa Cruz

transferred onto a 40-μm mesh to capture CD cells. Cells were plated on 
six 15-cm BD BioCoat type IV collagen-coated dishes (BD Biosciences). 
Cells were passaged after 3 days and placed either at 37°C or 33°C. At 70% 
confluence, the culture media were replaced with serum-free media and 
collected 3 days later for ELV preparation (n = 4).
Western blotting. Western blotting was performed on 3%–8% TA gels 
(Invitrogen) for 2.75 hours (cleavage/transmembrane assay, ELVs) or 
4.5 hours (membrane preparations) at 150 V at 4°C; loading amounts 
are as follows: exogenously expressed protein (20 μg), ELVs (10 μg), 
membrane preparations (60 μg), Molecular Weight Marker, HiMark 
(Invitrogen). For ER stress analysis and PC-1 WT/p.R3277C quantifica￾tion, WB was performed on 4%–12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) for 1 hour 
at 200 V at room temperature (ER stress, 20 μg; PC-1 quantification, 
50 μg protein). Gels were transferred to 0.45-μm nitrocellulose mem￾branes at 15 V overnight at 4°C. Quantified blots (PC-1 levels, cleav￾age/transmembrane assay, ELVs, ER stress) were developed using the 
LICOR system (Odyssey Sa) to assure linear quantification of the sig￾nal intensity; all other blots were probed with HRP-conjugated second￾ary antibodies (Southern Biotech). The following primary antibodies 
were used: 7e12 (1:500 dilution) (lab owned), PK (1:1,000) (Serotec), 
PDCD6IP (1:250) (ProteinTech), HSPA5 (1:5,000) (BD Biosciences), 
P4HB (1:1,000) (Cell Signaling), and TUBG1 (1:5,000) (γ-tubulin, 
Sigma-Aldrich). All EndoH and PNGase assays were performed accord￾ing to the manufacturer’s protocol (NEB).
Statistics. Statistical significance was determined using 2-tailed, unpaired, 
unequal sample size, equal variance Student’s t test. P < 0.05 was consid￾ered significant.
