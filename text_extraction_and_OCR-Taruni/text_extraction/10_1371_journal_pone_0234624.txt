Abstract
Introduction
The impact of living with Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC) on psychological wellbeing is
not well-known. A recent scoping review by the authors found that both depression and anxi￾ety frequently featured in the accounts of those living with the illness. However, less clear
were the factors that led to such psychological distress, the impact that the illness had on
families and how to best support those living or supporting someone living with the illness. In
light of this, the aim of this study was to explore how the illness impacted the lives of both
those diagnosed with the illness and those supporting them.
Method and results
This study adopted a phenomenological approach to understand the subjective experiences of
individual participants. A total of 30 individuals took part in Asynchronous Virtual Focus Groups
hosted on a Virtual Learning Environment for a four-week period. Chronological narratives of
individuals’ lived experiences from diagnosis to post-transplant are presented below. These
narratives centred upon individuals’ and families’ experiences of receiving a diagnosis, and
adjusting to life post-diagnosis, particularly in regard to their relationships with health profes￾sionals and other family members, and in preparing for the possibility of transplant.
Discussion
The present article provides an in-depth look at how PSC can impact psychological wellbe￾ing, how psychological distress arises and includes advice tailored to individuals, families
and health professionals on how to best support each other.

Introduction
Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC) is a cholestatic illness caused by inflammation and scar￾ring of the liver’s bile ducts [1]. Although some individuals may be asymptomatic at first, the
illness is associated with burdening symptoms such as itching, fatigue, jaundice and abdominal
pain [1, 2]. It is prevalent in 0–16.2 cases per every 100,000 individuals, though prevalence
rates appear to be on the increase [1, 3]. At present there is no known cause or medical treat￾ment to halt or slow the progression of the illness, with some of those diagnosed with PSC pro￾gressing to end-stage liver disease that requires transplantation or developing cancer [4, 5].
The impact of living with Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC) on psychological wellbeing
is not well-known. A recent scoping review by the authors mapping the available literature on
PSC and its plausible relationship with psychological wellbeing, found that individuals living
with the illness displayed a greater number of depressive symptoms and poorer wellbeing,
often coinciding with stage of liver disease and comorbidity with Inflammatory Bowel Disor￾der (IBD) [6–10]. Anxiety too was frequent and manifested as fears regarding future malig￾nancy, mortality, and receiving a transplant [7, 11, 12]. Missing from these accounts, however,
is an understanding of the causes of such distress, and a chronicle of the experiences and per￾ceptions of those living with PSC and caregivers ranging from diagnosis to life after transplant.
For this reason, this study qualitatively examined the lived experiences of both those living
with PSC and those informally supporting those living with PSC.
Materials and methods
Participants
Participants consisted of individuals aged 18 years or older, who were resident in the UK at the
time of participation, and self-identified either as someone living with PSC or a partner, family
member or carer of a person living with PSC. Participants were recruited and took part in the
study between September-November, 2018. These were purposively sampled according to
length of diagnosis, age and whether or not these had experiences of transplantation, in order
to ensure that a breadth of viewpoints was included.
A total of 30 individuals took part in the study: 22 were individuals living with PSC, with 8
family members supporting individuals living with PSC. Participants were allocated to one of
four focus groups with 6–9 people in each. Three of the focus groups comprised of individuals
living with PSC and included 10 males and 12 females. Their ages ranged from 28–74 years,
and their lengths of diagnosis at the time of the AVFG ranged from 6 months—20 years. The
majority (N = 19) had not received a transplant. Family members supporting those living with
PSC were all female: five mothers and three partners of individuals living with PSC. Their ages
ranged from 31–60 years and their relative’s length of time from diagnosis to the time of the
focus group ranged from 6 months—10 years.
Recruitment
Participants were recruited via PSC Support, a UK-based charity that provides information
and support to those affected by PSC, by means of study advertisements placed on its media
channels (ie. Facebook, Twitter, PSC Support website). These advertisements featured infor￾mation relating to the study and its purpose, in addition to the researchers’ contact details. All
potentially interested participants contacted the researchers using the contact details provided
in the advertisements. All those interested and eligible were then invited to take part in an
Asynchronous Virtual Focus Group (AVFG). AVFGs are online focus groups where

individuals log onto an online platform to post responses to questions [13, 14]. Participants
are typically asked to write one or more responses to each question within a given time limit.
Setting
AVFGs were hosted on Blackboard, a Virtual Learning Environment (Blackboard) that pro￾vided a secure and confidential space for research participants to write and interact with each
other [15–17]. This platform was chosen as it allowed the researchers to recruit individuals
with a rare illness from across the UK, and participants were able to take part in the study at a
time of their choosing and from the comfort of their own home.
Procedure
Participants were registered onto Blackboard under an alias chosen by them in order to pre￾serve their anonymity. Once registered, they were asked to log-in and familiarise themselves
with both the platform and all documents listed as ‘essential information’ within it. ‘Essential
information’ included: the study’s information sheet and separate consent form, contact details
for the researchers and support, and netiquette guidelines. Informed consent was necessary for
all participants and recorded online as a graded task. Once participants consented, the first
focus group question appeared as a discussion topic. Participants were asked to answer a dif￾ferent question each week for four weeks, relating to their experiences of receiving a diagnosis
of PSC, contact with health professionals, helpful supports and unhelpful barriers, and advice
they would share with someone newly diagnosed. These topics were identified by members of
PSC Support, who had lived experience of PSC. For a list of questions, please see Table 1. Par￾ticipants could post as often as they wished each week, both in response to the question posed
and in reaction to other participants’ responses. Participants received an email notification for
each new question posted. In order to ensure participants’ wellbeing during the AVFGs, dis￾cussion boards were moderated twice daily by researchers KM and VR.
Analysis
This study took a phenomenological approach as it was interested in understanding the subjec￾tive experiences of individual participants and the meaning that participants attributed to
these experiences. Focus group data were downloaded directly as text from Blackboard and
coded using NVivo as a data management system [18]. Text scripts were analysed adapting
Braun & Clarke’s (2006) thematic analysis with features of narrative analysis, as detailed by
Riessman (2008) [19, 20]. This involved both sequencing events and experiences, and grouping
commonalities and experiences within chronological sequences, and between the two types of
Table 1. Focus group questions divided according to week.
Week Question(s)
Week One Diagnosing PSC can be difficult. Can you tell us about how you felt when you were first diagnosed?
How have your feelings changed between then and now, if at all? Have you experienced an onset of
symptoms? What was your experience of these symptoms?
Week Two What was it like dealing with healthcare professionals before your diagnosis? Can you tell us about
your experiences dealing with healthcare professionals now that PSC is being treated? Have you been
offered emotional support? If yes, what kind of support was offered?
Week
Three
Since your diagnosis, what’s been most helpful for you? What helps you through the tough days? Has
there been anything that’s been unhelpful?
Week Four What advice would you give someone who has just been diagnosed with PSC?

participants. Themes and narratives were explored by two researchers (VR and KM), and any
disagreements discussed and resolved.
Ethical approval
This study was approved by the Health Research Authority from London—Queen Square
NHS Research Ethics Committee under application number 18/LO/1075.
Results
The narratives of those living with PSC are presented separately to those supporting someone.
These narratives follow a chronological order, beginning with participants’ experiences of
receiving a diagnosis, living with or supporting someone living with PSC post-diagnosis, to
chronicling experiences of transplantation and life post-transplant, where applicable. The
themes extrapolated from the data are presented in Table 2.
Living with PSC
Experiences of diagnosis. Diagnosis of PSC began in one of three ways: after abnormal
liver function tests were detected in routine blood tests, during routine scans for another seri￾ous condition that participants were already living with, or when participants reported increas￾ingly disabling symptoms of unknown origin that led them to seek medical attention. Such
help-seeking was sometimes met with attentiveness and concern by a helpful GP who speedily
referred the individual for diagnostic testing. Unfortunately, for others, help-seeking was met
with dismissal and misdiagnosis whereby symptoms were wrongly attributed to stress, burn
out, alcohol misuse, or a less serious physical condition. Such misdiagnosis led to secondary
care gatekeeping and prolonged delays in receiving appropriate specialist attention and treat￾ment. This sub-group wrote of being taken more seriously only when symptoms became more
advanced, or by changing general practitioner.

“The first GP I saw just kept telling me I was young and to stop burning the candle at both
ends. That was rubbish. I was struggling to stay awake and going to bed early. He made me
feel like I was wasting his time and making my symptoms up.” MC, female, 36
Shock. Diagnosis of PSC often came as a shock. Although some felt cared for and reas￾sured by health professionals, the majority felt that their diagnosis was given to them hastily,
sometimes over the telephone, with no comprehensive explanation of the implications of hav￾ing PSC, other than to inform participants that there was presently no known cause or cure for
PSC and that a transplant may be warranted in future. Furthermore, participants recounted
having little opportunity to ask further questions or receive adequate signposting for support.
Such detachment and lack of guidance exacerbated participants’ shock at discovering that they
had an incurable and rare illness.
“I was shocked and confused—I felt so well. I was also amazed that the registrars could drop
this bombshell on me, and leave me with no one to talk to and no further date for review—
with the next step being a liver ultrasound nearly 5 months later.” WW, female, 34
“The first specialist I saw had no grasp at all what it is like to be told you have a disease that is
chronic and has no cure. He was very blasé and to quote him ‘well you're a big fella so I
thought you wouldn't have any issues, I am surprised you took it this way’.” BB, male, 45
Anxiety. Such shock soon led to anxiety upon diagnosis. Fears regarding longevity, mor￾tality and the need for or ‘threat’ of a future transplant featured heavily in participants’
accounts, with diagnosis sometimes compared to a ‘death sentence’. Participants questioned
their future, and their ability to remain well and achieve the dreams they aspired to, such as
child-bearing or -rearing, particularly when diagnosed young. Concerns about developing or
experiencing worsening symptoms or illnesses such as cancer, undergoing further extensive
medical procedures, and not being alive to see their children grow older were prevalent across
the focus groups.
“I was newly married and had dreamed of starting a family soon. I felt like my hopes and
dreams for the future had been dashed in just a few minutes. I returned home and was incon￾solable for some time. I was scared of the thought of a transplant, of being told I may have
5–10 years if I was lucky, but most of all being told it was unlikely I would be able to conceive
due to the PSC and couldn't have a family. I was devastated.” MC, female, 36
Access to information. Such anxiety was compounded by a lack of easy access to helpful
information and guidance. Participants recognised that many of the medical professionals
from whom they received a diagnosis were unfamiliar with PSC, and also unprepared for giv￾ing such diagnosis. In the absence of information from medical professionals, participants
turned to the internet. The information found on the internet, however, was limited and
tended to portray more severe and advanced cases of PSC, thus worsening the worries already
experienced by many participants upon diagnosis.
“You are given this devastating news and then turfed out onto the street—literally- with no
offers of support and advice, and only Google to turn to for information—which is always a
bad idea in my experience!” OC, female, 48

Low mood. For many, such fears became intertwined with an onset of depressive symp￾toms, including physical manifestations such as insomnia, disturbed sleep, and weight loss.
Spiralling negative thoughts and feelings of hopelessness and despair from learning that PSC
had no cure also came to the fore. Expressions of grief and longing for the life participants felt
they had prior to diagnosis appeared frequently and focused on a real or foreseen loss of health,
quality of life and independence. In some, such distress was followed by a period of self-blame
and a desire to reprioritise life choices or achieve previously held dreams before time ran out.
“I was 29 and felt like my life had all of a sudden changed direction. I remember taking off my
make up one night and thinking “what is the point?” WW, female, 34
“The first week I was stuck in a spiral of negative thoughts, I slept and slept and slept. It felt
like my life was over.” DW, male, 42
Disclosure. Disclosure was often difficult for it cemented the reality of the diagnosis.
Some participants chose not to disclose their diagnosis to anyone other than their partner.
Though some reported feeling supported by family members and friends, disclosure some￾times amplified the helplessness participants already felt when members too encountered
upsetting descriptions of prognostic outcomes, and experienced similar barriers to accessing
trustworthy information. However, such disclosure was sometimes met with short-sighted￾ness, both in appreciating the complexity of the illness and understanding that pronounced
symptoms were often not visible.
“They can't see it—just think you are being lazy or moaning!. . . Tiredness will play a part—
which is something people can't see so I think they forget that I have something seriously
wrong with me. Don't get me wrong—I'm not looking for sympathy on a daily basis, but some￾times some understanding would be good.” BG, female, 40
Change after diagnosis. The period following diagnosis was characterised by great
change in many. Participants wrote of adjusting their life around how they felt each day, know￾ing their condition may rapidly deteriorate. Although some remained largely asymptomatic,
others experienced symptoms such as fatigue, itching, headaches, brain fog, nausea and
abdominal pain. They described being no longer able to ‘push through tiredness’ and being
unable to remain as physically active due to these symptoms. For many, this led to a process of
‘destressing’ their lives, resulting in changes to diet and exercise and, for some, ceasing
employment. Many, however, also reported a subsequent reduction in social activities leading
to isolation. This was particularly felt by those who experienced a loss of consistent employ￾ment that provided opportunities for socialisation. Feeling isolated due to the rarity of the ill￾ness whilst observing family members and friends working and functioning as ‘normal’
created feelings of loneliness.
“Since my diagnosis my fatigue continued. I was forced to cut my hours and end my dream
career. I had to change my job. I had become unreliable at work and physically was struggling
to drive to work.” MC, female, 34

“I am 57 years old and my quality of life now is dreadful. I rarely go out and have become
quite isolated as my friends and family all work while I sit at home. The only way I can
describe it is I feel that I am actually grieving for the life I had.” RW, female, 57
Support from family, friends and peers. Families represented a crucial source of support
for many. Participants acknowledged the difficulty family members experienced in providing
regular support, particularly for an illness where individuals can be periodically asymptomatic
or not show physical signs of being unwell. Although the invisibility of the illness was a diffi￾culty for both, family members were praised for the practical and/or emotional support they
provided. During periods where participants experienced incapacitating symptoms, they
expressed worry and guilt that they may be holding family members back from taking part in
activities they were interested in, and sadness that they were missing out on important family
moments or unintentionally neglecting the needs of other family members. Participants, how￾ever, felt supported when family members took an interest in PSC and researched dietary
plans and treatment, as well as attending medical appointments with them. Family members
were cherished when they helped calm participants during moments of anxiety, encouraging
them to overcome obstacles and bad days.
Similarly, some participants felt that they could rely on their friends in times of need. Oth￾ers, however, felt abandoned by friends who either failed to show interest in them and their ill￾ness, or misunderstood the impact of PSC on their lives, for example in being unable to
maintain scheduled meet-ups.
“The most stressful aspect has been dealing with people who don’t understand what it’s like to
get a diagnosis of a disease like PSC and how hard it can be at times. Some very longstanding
friends just stopped contacting me. This was the toughest thing I’ve ever had to deal with,
including the disease itself and having cancer.” DP, female, 56
In searching for an understanding place to counteract their sense of loneliness, participants
turned towards peers who could relate, answer questions and exchange information. Peer
groups, such as PSC Support, provided a sense of community where members could talk to
each other and feel comforted by observing others living a ‘normal’ life, especially in the
absence of local support groups. However, such groups also had the potential to scare or dis￾turb participants when younger or more advanced cases of PSC were discussed.
“The Facebook group does have its downside because it makes you very aware of all the ‘bad
stuff’ and you watch people suffering and going through hell, it is particularly disturbing to
watch the suffering of the younger members of the group.” EL, female, 68
Contact with health professionals. Individuals also approached specialists in order to
access medication to alleviate symptoms and receive ongoing care. For some, this was a posi￾tive experience, resulting in individuals feeling encouraged and cared for. These participants
felt reassured when seeing the same specialist at each appointment who shared their contact
details in case of need. They described having a good relationship with their specialist, felt
‘lucky’ to be treated by them, and ‘safe’ within their treating team. Specialists were commended
when taking a holistic approach to the person’s care, particularly when the individual had
comorbidities. Those accessing liver teams at regional specialist centres or via private

healthcare, in particular, portrayed their specialist as informed, kind and sympathetic, and felt
their illness was monitored regularly, and their queries answered.
“Woo! What a change that made to my life. I felt like Wonder Woman compared to what I
had been like before. This consultant was extremely engaging, knowledgeable, showed genuine
interest in me and how I was.” JJ, female, 53
“The regional centre that I'm being treated at for PSC seems to have PSC aware healthcare
professionals and I feel lucky to be treated there. I wouldn't go anywhere else for my care now
as it feels like outside of that setting the healthcare professionals are still Googling PSC when I
present to them”. FM, male, 32
Most, however, expressed ongoing difficulties in receiving supportive care from a specialist
due to a lack of continuity of care within the NHS. Participants often experienced prolonged
waiting times between appointments, and met with different doctors at each appointment,
whose knowledge and interest in PSC varied widely. Where hepatologists were unavailable,
due to the size and geographical location of participants’ local hospital, participants were seen
and treated by a gastroenterologist for PSC. These, however, tended to be perceived as less
knowledgeable and more reluctant to discuss PSC. Doctors were, at times, perceived as in
need of training on both PSC itself and on how to sensitively deliver information to those with
PSC and their families; adjectives such as ‘rude’, ‘blunt’, ‘unconcerned’, and ‘unempathetic’
were used. Consequentially, these individuals wrote of needing to ‘educate’ their doctors or
feeling ‘abandoned to their fate’. Whilst one individual felt that they needed to take a break due
to over-treatment, many others felt they had to advocate to receive further investigations and
support.
“My parents, who I had taken with me, had questions that they asked to help me and them,
but they were brushed off quickly and not really answered. In fact, my specialist was pretty
rude and stand offish. He didn't seem to know much about it either other than the real basics.”
AS, female, 28
Contact with specialists remained infrequent for many, particularly if relatively asymptom￾atic. Therefore, general practitioners acted as participants’ go-to for support between appoint￾ments. Similarly to specialists, some GPs were greatly valued by participants, and viewed as
open-minded and keen to learn and reach out to specialists when unsure of how to treat. Par￾ticipants were distressed or apprehensive at the prospect that a supportive GP may retire. Oth￾ers, however, experienced difficulty accessing a GP or found their GP unhelpful and
uninformed. One participant wrote that their GP told them that it was their responsibility
patient to ‘chase’ the consultant.
Advocacy. Both disparities in NHS budget allocations across the UK, and poor collabora￾tion and communication across specialist teams and primary care meant advocating to receive
appropriate medical attention and support was a common occurrence, both in secondary and
primary care. Participants had chased up appointments and test results, prompted physicians
for monitoring, and liaised between different hospitals and teams, sometimes across different
counties, to ensure that their medical records were up-to-date. Without self-advocacy,
appointment scheduling or regular monitoring would fall through, but required energy and an
understanding of medical terminology, which participants did not always have.

“I have been the one chasing up appointments and letters and have often made sure I take my
blood results from my GP to my liver consultants or other consultant appts, as I cannot rely
on their systems to communicate efficiently. If I didn’t do this, then often they would never
have seen the information. For me the communication between different trusts and various
healthcare professionals is very poor at times.” MC, female, 36
“The different funding pots of the NHS have a real influence on quality of care–[retracted hos￾pital name] were surprised that my GP was prepared to prescribe one of my anti rejection
drugs, as their experience was that many wouldn't. As a patient you shouldn't get caught up
in these inter-NHS issues.” OC, female, 48
“I fear that sometimes it comes down to who’s budget is paying for the tests or medication. I
know my hospital stopped giving me medication at the hospital and told me to go to my GP,
this was so that the cost didn’t come from the hospital budget but from the GPs.” JJ, female, 53
Psychological support. When asked about whether they received or accessed psychologi￾cal support via healthcare professionals, most participants revealed that they were often not
asked about how PSC impacted them psychologically. Not being asked about their psychologi￾cal wellbeing, led those living with PSC to question whether physicians fully understood the
psychological impact of the illness. Participants felt that particular consultants assumed that
the individual was ‘handling it’ and, in one instance, reflected sexist beliefs that a diagnosis of
PSC would not affect men emotionally. A need for psychological support was picked up in
three instances, either by a nurse working on the individual’s IBD team who referred them
onto a liaison psychiatry team or by GPs, however, never by a member of a liver team.
“I don't think many consultants—however good they are—understand the psychological
impact of having a long term chronic and progressive rare disease, but if they were enabled to
understand even a little it would make a huge difference to treatment.” OC, female, 48
In the overall absence of professional psychological support, participants wrote of adopting
alternative coping mechanisms that involved resting, distraction, engaging in intellectually
stimulating activities and spending time with family and friends. Volunteering helped partici￾pants feel that they were making a difference, by assisting others living with PSC and giving
back some of the support received from organisations such as PSC Support. Furthermore,
becoming more involved in research on PSC, and more informed about PSC empowered par￾ticipants, reduced their sense of isolation and gave participants hope about the possibility of
successful future treatment. Such hope helped participants maintain an optimistic outlook.
Preparing for transplant. The prospect of transplantation brought both relief and anxiety
to many individuals actively preparing for the procedure. Transplant assessment and ‘booking’
represented an end to a continuous deterioration in health, as well as an end to waiting for a
long-feared surgery. Such anxiety centred upon fears of undergoing the procedure itself, and
changes to life, work and wellbeing post-transplant. Transplant was viewed as an insurmount￾able barrier by those who had to overcome their fear of hospitals and those who associated
transplant with death. For some, these fears were partly alleviated by feeling cared for by a
knowledgeable specialist who provided clear information and allowed individuals to retain a
sense of control over their care.
“Increasingly in the year leading up to transplant I saw the same person, who I was able to
develop a proper relationship with her. This consistency was really important to me—not hav￾ing to go over my history again and again with someone different.” OC, female, 48
PLOS ONE
The PSC Wellbeing Study
PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0234624 July 6, 2020 9 / 17

A need for psychological support was also identified by all of those preparing for transplant.
Participants spoke of needing someone to help them manage both the ‘everyday’ and their anx￾iety and sense of isolation. Such support was again difficult to access. Participants were told
that there was no automatic referral pathway and that they must self-refer to mental health ser￾vices, which required completing questionnaires at a time where both health and energy were
at a low point.
“During the transplant assessment process, I saw. . . a Mental Health Nurse. I was really clear
with her that I wanted and needed psychological support, but she freely admitted that there
was no route for them to secure that help for me. I did look at the online referral process, but it
was so meaningless (with generic questions such as are you suicidal? have you ever wanted to
hurt yourself?) that I just couldn't face it. I was feeling so unwell that I just needed it to be a
process that required no effort and which could be done for me.” OC, female, 48
Life after transplant. Three participants received a liver transplant at the time of inter￾viewing. Recovery was extensive and arduous as it led to weight loss, weakness and temporary
increased dependency on health professionals and family. Nevertheless, after some time, most
reported experiencing an improvement in their health and a return to activities previously
enjoyed. Yet, this was accompanied by symptom monitoring and a fear that PSC may someday
return. At the time of participation, none of the participants re-experienced PSC symptoms
post-transplant.
Supporting those living with PSC
Reacting to a relative’s diagnosis. Family members tended to express similar reactions to
becoming aware of their relative’s diagnosis: a grieving process characterised by initial shock
about a serious illness, disbelief and denial of the illness itself and its consequences. These also
experienced anger and frustration at seeing their relative in pain or imagining their future.
Such grief was often compounded by their relative’s young age at the time of diagnosis and see￾ing their young relative lose the aspirations they had prior to illness. Distress and anxiety were
a central feature of this experience but were concealed from their relative in an effort to remain
a positive and supportive influence. Nevertheless, feelings of sadness, helplessness and power￾lessness due to being unable to make their relative feel physically better or decrease their stress,
were commonplace.
“My biggest fear is that this horrible disease will steal my son from me one way or the other.”
QQ, mother, 50
“I do worry about how he will manage to support himself in the future. He was upset when his
brother became a dad this year as he thinks he will never have the energy to look after a family
of his own.” NW, mother, 57
Not all caregivers were present at the time of diagnosis. Similarly to those living with PSC,
those who were present at the time that their relative received a diagnosis of PSC recounted
feeling incredulous by the lack of information provided by healthcare professionals and the
brisk manner with which diagnosis was delivered. They described needing to resort to free
search engines to understand what PSC referred to and its long-term outcomes, often with
frightening consequences.

“I. . . had never heard of PSC. The consultant wrote it on a piece of paper, I dropped my son
off at university and came home and googled it. I think that was possibly the longest night of
my life! I was devastated to read that the survival was 8–10 years and to his day I am
astounded that the consultant did not at least attempt to explain to us what PSC is.” NW,
mother, 57
Adjustment. Diagnosis led to a pronounced period of adjustment in families. Although
PSC impacted many families’ every-day lives prior to formal diagnosis, there was an ongoing
need to accommodate both sudden and routine onsets of symptoms. However, physical symp￾toms weren’t the only concern for caregivers, with many noted substantive psychological
symptoms in their relative arising from receiving a diagnosis of PSC. In some circumstances,
those living with PSC returned to live in their family homes. When severity of symptoms and
care needed exceeded the family’s resources, caregivers took steps to temporarily or perma￾nently stop working.
“I describe it as living with a huge cloud hanging over our heads as symptoms can be so
changeable, one week fine and then next week could be hospital admissions!” CP, wife, 35
“[Son] seemed to take the news well but over the following months became mentally ill and
was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. When we next visited he was so thin that he had
to sit down in the shower, very anxious, crying, shaking and struggling to leave the flat. He
came home to stay with us and over the next few months built up his eating. . .” NW, mother,
57
Psychological impact on caregivers. Caring for their relative and adjusting to PSC also
impacted the psychological wellbeing of family members, with many experiencing symptoms
of psychological distress, although few were offered psychological support. In one instance, the
caregiver reported being offered antidepressants which they refused and, in another, the care￾giver was only able to secure short-term counselling via their workplace. In an effort to coun￾teract such distress, families spoke of shifting their focus to work or children in an effort to
distract themselves. Remaining hopeful that a new curative treatment may be found, staying
connected with friends and family, and partaking in exercise helped families achieve a positive
outlook. However, not all shared their fears in an effort to not burden others.
“My son’s diagnosis totally devastated us. We are both extremely positive people but do now
suffer from some anxiety and stress due to worrying about the future. . . I worry all the time
when he’s ill and I think more negatively than normal. . . even to the point that I’m scared I
might lose him. These are when I have really dark days and I don’t really share my feelings
with anyone, because I don’t want to worry family members.” EJ, mother, 50
Inclusion by health professionals. Comparably to those living with PSC, families’ recol￾lections of their contact with their relative’s healthcare professionals varied. Some expressed
feeling listened to and included in their relative’s care by their relative’s treating clinician.
However, many other participants highlighted experiences where their concerns were dis￾missed by health professionals, some of whom cited patient confidentiality as a reason for not
keeping caregivers abreast of their relative’s illness progression. These caregivers felt the need
PLOS ONE
The PSC Wellbeing Study
PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0234624 July 6, 2020 11 / 17

to advocate for their relative in order for them to receive adequate care, from professionals
who were unfamiliar with PSC.
“I’m beginning to feel a bit desperate—if I don’t chase, my son gets forgotten.” DF, mother, 52
Families also turned to online support websites led by charities such as PSC Support. Such
websites were viewed as an invaluable source of friendly support and up-to-date information
on PSC and research into the illness.
“He is now seen each time by the same senior consultant. He has got to know us really well
and is extremely supportive. We have access to contact him anytime. This has made an
immense difference to both our emotional well-being.” EJ, mother, 50
Resilience. Although PSC brought a high degree of uncertainty regarding the future, care￾givers also spoke of positive changes resulting from their relative’s diagnosis, including an
increase in resilience and positive outlook. Though these expressed that PSC was ‘always at the
back of [their] mind’, they spoke of accepting the impact of the illness on the family. Support￾ing someone with PSC, in some cases, also led families to feel closer to each other in fighting
the illness together.
“I . . . have often thought when I have been under the weather, how on earth does he get up
and carry on feeling like that every day!” NW, mother, 57
“Our outlook on life has definitely changed we try not to stress about the smaller mundane
things that used to seem stressful.” CP, wife, 35
Discussion
Diagnosis of PSC often came as a shock to both those diagnosed with it and family members.
It was often shared hastily or with no comprehensive explanation by health professionals
about what PSC may entail, and with little opportunity to ask further questions or receive ade￾quate signposting for support. Furthermore, it was associated with psychological distress in
those living with the illness and caregivers, who spoke of ongoing fears regarding longevity
and mortality, and about worsening symptoms or further serious illnesses such as cancer. Such
distress was compounded by a lack of access to reliable information or specialists and dis￾rupted or disjointed care. Both groups spoke of difficulties in adjusting to life post-diagnosis,
often due to decreased levels of functioning and health and, in some, a sense of isolation due to
reduced opportunities to socialise. In the absence of professional psychological support, partic￾ipants turned to other coping mechanisms, such as volunteering and partaking in activities
that provided distraction and a sense of intellectual stimulation. Connecting with other mem￾bers of their families, friends and peers who understood the illness helped participants remain
positive.
Comparison to previous literature
Although there is dearth of literature that documents the experiences of those living with PSC
and their caregivers, many of the findings of this study are comparable to the experiences of
those with other rare, serious or progressive illnesses. For instance, the presence of psychologi￾cal distress is notable in those living with rare or advanced cancers [21, 22]. Reduced physical
PLOS ONE
The PSC Wellbeing Study

functioning due to disabling symptoms, and reduced wellbeing and functioning in psychologi￾cal, work and social spheres have been reported in those living with other illnesses [23]. Shock
at receiving a diagnosis of an incurable illness and feeling distressed about the progressive
nature of it is recognised in the narratives of those living with incurable cancer [24]. Partici￾pants’ sense of isolation and loneliness is also reflected in the accounts of those living with
rare, incurable or painful illness [25–27]. Finally, coping responses such as denial, acceptance,
positivity and slowing down the pace of life were reported by individuals who, like many of
those living with PSC, had multiple chronic conditions or were living with incurable cancer
[24, 28].
Strengths and weaknesses
This study had four main strengths and four limitations. The use of online focus groups
allowed the researchers to access geographically diverse populations within the UK who may
have otherwise been unable to participate in the study using conventional qualitative methods.
It also allowed participants, who could be very symptomatic, to take part in the study from the
comfort of their own home by logging in at a time of their choosing. Such ease of access may
have facilitated the researchers in reaching saturation, whereby no new knowledge was emerg￾ing. Participants also wrote their own narratives, which was potentially therapeutic in itself
and also eliminated the need for transcription. However, the use of this method also reduced
participants’ spontaneity of speech as these could edit their text prior to submitting it. Partici￾pation in the study was literacy and tech-literacy dependent which may have excluded some of
our target population. Participants also responded to advertisements in order to participate in
the study which may have introduced a self-selection bias in our sample. Furthermore, we
posit that saturation was unlikely to have been reached with regard to caregivers’ accounts,
and narratives regarding transplantation. Participants were not specifically asked about trans￾plantation and fewer caregivers contacted the research team to participate. This information
was included in light of the limited available research on these topics, therefore, must be inter￾preted with caution.
Implications
The study’s findings suggest three key implications. Firstly, from participants’ narratives, it is
clear that greater cohesiveness and interconnectivity between services is needed to facilitate
participants’ wellbeing, particularly as many of these presented with other serious comorbidi￾ties. Such cohesion should also extend to ensuring continuity of care, whereby participants
could be seen by the same specialist who was familiar with their case at each appointment. Sec￾ondly, a need for signposting to reliable and accurate information and sources of support
around the time of diagnosis, especially for such a rare and ‘invisible’ illness, would help fami￾lies familiarise themselves with the illness and feel less isolated. Finally, these narratives spoke
to a need for greater access to long-term psychological support, and for psychological wellbe￾ing to be included within the discourse of primary and secondary care appointments.
Future research and clinical practice
Although this is a significant first step towards understanding the experiences of this group,
future research should address a continuing gap in knowledge regarding the experiences of
those post-transplant and their caregivers. It should also seek to address how psychological dis￾tress could be supported within the constraints of both primary and secondary care by incor￾porating the views of health and psychological health professionals. Finally, both research and
clinical practice could be improved by following the advice in Table 3 below, which was

Table 3. Advice given by participants targeted at newly diagnosed patients and families, and health professions.
For those living with PSC and those
supporting them:
➾ Become an expert on PSC: Research PSC and familiarise yourself with the
illness so that you know what symptoms to look out for and when you might
need medical or psychological intervention. Share what you learn with those
supporting you so that they can better support you. Doing so will likely make
you feel more empowered in the face of an uncertain illness progression.
➾ However, be careful when googling PSC: Some of the information
commonly found on the internet may be outdated, inapplicable to you, or
may not originate from reputable sources leading to considerable
psychological distress. It is better to locate information regarding PSC from
trusted resources such as PSC Support, the British Liver Trust, and NHS or
equivalent healthcare websites.
➾ Accept that you will likely have bad days: Participants strongly spoke of
needing to accept that the illness may get worse, that there is uncertainty
regarding its progression and that it will likely cause limitations because of ill
health. Denial of PSC was viewed as a barrier to getting support, especially
from peers. Acknowledge that the illness and some of the medications may
have a psychological impact on wellbeing.
➾ But don’t assume that the worst will happen to you: PSC affects people in
different ways. Some have milder symptoms whilst others may need a
transplant. Also, remember that there are many positive stories from people
who have received a transplant and live ‘normal’ lives again. Some of those
stories emerged within these focus groups.
➾ Nonetheless, prepare for emergencies: Easy access to contact details for a
GP, consultant or A&E may reduce anxiety regarding what to do in the event
of acute illness.
➾ Prepare for appointments: Formulate and note down a list of questions to
ask your treating clinician and bring a notepad to take notes. Also, bring
someone supportive with you as you may not recall all of what was said
during the appointments, and they can ask questions relating to how best to
support you.
➾ Try to build a working relationship with a healthcare professional you can
trust: This can be someone you call in case of ill health, that understands the
impact of the illness or is willing to research it, and that you feel comfortable
speaking to and asking as many questions as you need. You may see many
healthcare professionals inconsistently and may not get on with others, so
take a note of the ones you found supportive. Don’t assume that these are
aware of other possible comorbidities and keep them abreast of your
wellbeing.
➾ Advocate for what you need: Ask for more information, regular
monitoring, referral to a specialist and referral to psychological support, if
you feel you need these.
➾ Please talk to someone: Decide who you would feel comfortable disclosing
your diagnosis to and try to build a support network. Family and friends
who could understand the illness and took the time to listen were often a
source of comfort and strength for participants. Peer support from other
individuals either living with PSC or supporting others living with PSC was a
valuable source of information and encouragement. These expressed feeling
less alone when sharing their concerns with peers who could advise and
show them that PSC was not the focal point of their lives. Speaking to others,
such as family, to let them know what is happening for you may also make
you feel more psychologically supported and, in turn, lets them understand
the illness better. For some, disclosure to employers and colleagues led to
receiving workplace support. Others, however, fear being treated differently
in the workplace
➾ Take part in research (if you feel up to it): Participants felt that it made
them feel like they were part of something larger, where they had a safe space
to share their experiences in a way that could help others.
➾ De-stress your life (if you can): Focus on spending time doing the things
that make you feel happy or well. For some participants, changing jobs or
working hours, exercising, taking up hobbies and spending time with family
or friends made them feel more psychologically and physically well.

Table 3. (Continued)
Advice for healthcare professionals ➾ Show sensitivity towards patients and families at the time of diagnosis:
Many patients and families will be in shock at the news. Some patients will
be asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis and will not have suspected that
they were unwell. Many will likely be distressed by the rarity and precarity of
the illness. Please provide patients and families with an empathic ear and an
opportunity to ask questions.
➾ Get informed if you aren’t familiar with PSC: Participants acknowledged
that PSC is a rare illness and that most healthcare professionals will be
unfamiliar with PSC. However, these also found that informed professionals
were a notable source of support. Don’t assume that someone with high liver
function test values is misusing alcohol.
➾ Signpost patients and their families to sources of information and support:
All patients and families expressed a need for more information at the time
of diagnosis. In the absence of such information from their doctors, they
often resorted to using search engines which may show false and/or
damaging information. A need for information may also arise between
appointments. Familiarise yourself and have a leaflet ready for patients and
families to take home with them. Also, signpost patients and families to
appropriate websites that focus on liver health.
➾ Speak to patients and families about the psychological impact of PSC: PSC,
like other long-term illnesses, may affect individuals’ psychological
wellbeing. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were commonly spoken
about in participants’ narratives. However, they were rarely spoken about or
treated adequately by health professionals, according to patients and
families.
