Review Mucopolysaccharidosis VI
Vassili Valayannopoulos*1, Helen Nicely2, Paul Harmatz3 and Sean Turbeville2
Abstract
Mucopolysaccharidosis VI (MPS VI) is a lysosomal storage disease with progressive multisystem involvement, associated 
with a deficiency of arylsulfatase B leading to the accumulation of dermatan sulfate. Birth prevalence is between 1 in 
43,261 and 1 in 1,505,160 live births. The disorder shows a wide spectrum of symptoms from slowly to rapidly 
progressing forms. The characteristic skeletal dysplasia includes short stature, dysostosis multiplex and degenerative 
joint disease. Rapidly progressing forms may have onset from birth, elevated urinary glycosaminoglycans (generally 
>100 μg/mg creatinine), severe dysostosis multiplex, short stature, and death before the 2nd or 3rd decades. A more 
slowly progressing form has been described as having later onset, mildly elevated glycosaminoglycans (generally <100 
μg/mg creatinine), mild dysostosis multiplex, with death in the 4th or 5th decades. Other clinical findings may include 
cardiac valve disease, reduced pulmonary function, hepatosplenomegaly, sinusitis, otitis media, hearing loss, sleep 
apnea, corneal clouding, carpal tunnel disease, and inguinal or umbilical hernia. Although intellectual deficit is 
generally absent in MPS VI, central nervous system findings may include cervical cord compression caused by cervical 
spinal instability, meningeal thickening and/or bony stenosis, communicating hydrocephalus, optic nerve atrophy and 
blindness. The disorder is transmitted in an autosomal recessive manner and is caused by mutations in the ARSB gene, 
located in chromosome 5 (5q13-5q14). Over 130 ARSB mutations have been reported, causing absent or reduced 
arylsulfatase B (N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfatase) activity and interrupted dermatan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate 
degradation. Diagnosis generally requires evidence of clinical phenotype, arylsulfatase B enzyme activity <10% of the 
lower limit of normal in cultured fibroblasts or isolated leukocytes, and demonstration of a normal activity of a different 
sulfatase enzyme (to exclude multiple sulfatase deficiency). The finding of elevated urinary dermatan sulfate with the 
absence of heparan sulfate is supportive. In addition to multiple sulfatase deficiency, the differential diagnosis should 
also include other forms of MPS (MPS I, II IVA, VII), sialidosis and mucolipidosis. Before enzyme replacement therapy 
(ERT) with galsulfase (Naglazyme®), clinical management was limited to supportive care and hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation. Galsulfase is now widely available and is a specific therapy providing improved endurance with an 
acceptable safety profile. Prognosis is variable depending on the age of onset, rate of disease progression, age at 
initiation of ERT and on the quality of the medical care provided.

Definition
Mucopolysaccharidosis VI (MPS VI) or Maroteaux-Lamy
syndrome (MIM # 253200) is an autosomal recessive lys￾osomal storage disorder described in 1963 by Dr. Pierre
Maroteaux and Dr. Maurice Lamy [1] and determined by
mutations in the arylsulfatase B (ARSB) gene located in
chromosome 5 (5q13-5q14)[2]. Pathogenic mutations of
this gene result in reduced or absent activity of the
enzyme arylsulfatase B (ASB) also called N-acetylgalac￾tosamine 4-sulfatase (E.C.3.1.6.12) leading to incomplete
degradation and cellular accumulation of the glycosamin￾oglycan(s) (GAG), (previously also known as a "muco￾polysaccharide" dermatan sulfate (DS)), and cell injury.
Another GAG, chondroitin 4-sulfate (CS), is also a sub￾strate for ASB [3,4] but is hydrolyzed by hyaluronidase
and β-glucuronidase to trisaccharides and higher oligo￾saccharides that also accumulate but are not recognized
as "classic storage material" [J Hopwood, personal com￾munication]. Clinical manifestations are related to pro￾gressive accumulation of DS GAG and sulfated

oligosaccharides derived from both DS and CS in lyso￾somes, cells and tissues.
Epidemiology
The epidemiological studies of MPS VI are limited to
publications describing birth prevalence whereas no
studies describing population prevalence are available.
These birth prevalence studies are based on clinical iden￾tification of patients and regional birth rate [5] as repre￾sented in Table 1. They range from 1 in 43,261 births in
Turkish immigrants living in Germany [6] to 1 in
1,505,160 births in Sweden [7]. Because these birth prev￾alence estimates are derived from patient referrals based
mostly on clinical identification, (except for a single pub￾lication that mentions prenatal diagnosis for one patient
in Australia [8]), they will be underestimates of the true
birth prevalence, which will only be determined when
newborn screening becomes available. Because of the
limited number of countries involved in these estimates,
it is not possible to generate a worldwide estimate of birth
prevalence. In the US, the absence of centralized labora￾tory diagnosis makes it difficult to provide birth preva￾lence for MPS VI as was completed in the above surveys.
The relative frequency of MPS VI compared to other
mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) was reported where possi￾ble. As shown in Table 1, MPS VI ranges from 2-4% of all
MPS in Scandinavia (Sweden, Norway and Denmark) [7]
and 3% in the Netherlands [9], to highs of 16% in Portugal
[10] and 18.5% in Brazil [11].
Although no specific ethnic group has been associated
with an increased risk of MPS VI, some populations have
been found to have increased frequencies of specific
mutations. As described by Petry et al 2003 and 2005
[12,13], there is a common mutation 1533del23 among
Brazilian MPS VI patients found in 23% of alleles, which
also occurs in Portuguese MPS VI patients, although the
frequency is unknown.
Very high birth prevalence was identified in the Turkish
population living in Germany in contrast to the non￾Turkish German population (1 in 43,261 vs. 1 in 432,610,
respectively) [6]. Baehner et al, (2005) suggest that this
might be related to a high degree of consanguinity within
this ethnic population. Since birth prevalence appears to
be 10-fold higher among Turkish Germans than non￾Turkish Germans, we may be greatly underestimating
MPS VI birth prevalence in selected regions or world￾wide if it is based on earlier country surveys with popula￾tions having a low frequency of consanguinity.
Clinical description
The clinical presentation of MPS VI varies greatly with
respect to age of onset and rate of disease progression.
Swiedler et al, (2005) [14] conducted a cross-sectional
survey of a group of 121 untreated MPS VI patients and
suggested that two broad classification groups could be
characterized based on height and urinary GAG (uGAG)
levels. High uGAG levels (>200 μg/mg creatinine) were
associated with an advanced clinical course relative to age
characterized by short stature (height range 80 cm to 120
cm), low body weight, impaired endurance based on a
walk test, compromised pulmonary function, and
reduced joint range of motion. Age greater than 20 years
was rarely found with uGAG levels above a threshold of
100 μg/mg creatinine, suggesting uGAG < 100 μg/mg cre￾atinine might predict longer survival. Those with slowly
progressing disease tended to have heights above 140 cm
and uGAG levels below 100 μg/mg creatinine.
Although descriptive classification systems have mostly
described patients as rapidly progressing (with severe
symptoms) or slowly progressing (with mild or attenu￾ated symptoms), an intermediate stage has also been
described [14-20]. Despite the utility of communicating
with these descriptive categories, it is important to recog￾nize that the disease manifests symptoms along a contin￾uum. Compared to the rapidly progressing disease where
severe symptoms occur in several systems simultane￾ously, the slowly progressing disease may have clinically
significant symptoms occurring in fewer systems[17]. For
example, severe symptoms may progress in a single organ
system within the slowly progressing teenage or adult
patient to an extent of requiring surgery (e.g., hip replace￾ment, cardiac valve replacement, corneal transplantation,
or cervical spinal cord decompression[16]). In a recent
publication, Karageorgos et al 2007 [15] have classified
certain gene mutations of the ARSB gene as likely to
result in phenotypes falling into the descriptive categories
of rapidly progressing, intermediate, and slowly progress￾ing disease. Despite the authors' separation of gene muta￾tions into three groups by severity among MPS VI
patients, it is important to emphasize that there are no
fixed parameters for separating these descriptive catego￾ries. The 105 patients studied by Karageorgos et al (2007)
were participants in the BioMarin Phase 1/2, Phase 2 or
Survey Study, and phenotype correlations were generated
from clinical data described in these studies.
Rapidly Progressing MPS VI
The rapidly progressing form has correlation to certain
alleles described in the literature [15], is characterized in
most cases by onset before 2 or 3 years of age, impaired
mobility by 10 years of age, absent or delayed puberty,
cervical spinal cord compression, respiratory insuffi￾ciency and surgical complications. Patients with the rap￾idly progressing form were frequently reported to die
from heart failure in the 2nd or 3rd decades [21]. From
the cross-sectional survey [14], one can deduce that the
higher the uGAG, the faster is the rate of clinical develop￾ment. Growth often slows after the first year of life with

complete cessation at 3 to 4 years of age. Adult height is
generally less than 120 cm [14]. Other physical findings
may include thoracic deformity (pectus carinatum), stiff
and contracted joints, scoliosis or kyphosis (gibbus mal￾formation), macrocephaly, hepatosplenomegaly, protrud￾ing abdomen, umbilical and/or inguinal hernia, coarse
facial features (Fig 1) including frontal bossing, a
depressed nasal bridge, enlarged tongue, gingival hyper￾trophy, delayed dental eruption, and hypertrichosis (hir￾sutism). Patients may have labored breathing, loud
snoring with sleep apnea, thick nasal discharge, frequent
sinusitis or otitis media arising from narrowed airways
and thick mucous secretions [22]. Hearing loss, involving
both conductive and neurosensory mechanisms, is com￾mon and may lead to the impression that the patient may
have developmental delay. Vision is often compromised
by slowly increasing corneal clouding (Fig 2), but can also
show rapid deterioration related to optic nerve damage
from increased intracranial pressure or compression
along the optic nerve [23]. Patients older than 10 years
may progress to severe pulmonary obstruction and respi￾ratory failure requiring tracheostomy [24], cardiac valve
regurgitation or stenosis requiring valve replacement,
severe joint disease [25] especially of the hips that may
require replacement, claw-hand deformities (Fig 3) sec￾ondary to flexion contractures and carpal tunnel disease
requiring median nerve release, severe spinal kyphosis,
scoliosis (Fig 4), and cervical stenosis with spinal cord
compression [26,21] requiring decompression and possi￾ble stabilization to prevent paralysis. These severe symp￾toms occurring together are typical of rapidly progressing
disease and result in multiple hospital visits and surgical
procedures accompanied by high-risk anesthesia [26]. In
general, patients of the rapidly progressing disease type
have uGAG elevated above those levels observed in
slowly progressing patients.

***Lowry et al, 1990[119] reported one case over a 44-year period from 1952-1986, although this period includes a period prior to the first 
description of MPS VI in 1963. It is unclear if this is the same case reported by Applegarth et al, 2000[118], for the same population. Also the 
period given in Table 1 by Lowry et al, 1990[119], is corrected from the previously cited birth prevalence in MPS VI literature to represent here 
the live births reported in the more accurate period from 1962 to 1986 as this is the closest period in the report to the first description of MPS 
VI in 1963.

Slowly Progressing MPS VI
The slowly progressing disease form (Fig 5 and Fig 6) is
characterized by later onset of symptoms due to lower
levels of dermatan sulfate [14]. Symptoms may not at first
appear in a recognized pattern, but when apparent, usu￾ally in teen years or early adulthood, the milder symp￾toms of MPS disease may be observed by an alert
physician and lead ultimately to diagnosis [21,27,28].
Despite classification as slowly progressive, these patients
may develop skeletal complications including carpal tun￾nel disease, hip disease and a decrease in their overall

functional status by the late teenage years [14]. Diagnosis
generally occurs after 5 years of age and may be delayed
until the 2nd or 3rd decades. However, most patients with
MPS VI will develop serious manifestations of the disease
at some point including joint degeneration, cardiac valve
disease, sleep apnea, a decrease in pulmonary function
and reduced endurance [28]. Evidence of a therapeutic
response following treatment with galsulfase in five
slowly progressing adult patients was reported recently
by Lampe et al 2008 [27].
A case history presented by Brooks et al, (2005) [29]
describes a very mild case of a female, aged 44 years, at
the extreme end of the scale of the slowly progressing
patients, without visible or clinical symptoms of MPS VI,
who was detected upon routine blood examination to
have inclusion bodies in lysosomes of white blood cells,
suggestive of a lysosomal storage disorder (LSD). She had
a 5% level of the normal ASB catalytic activity, slight der￾matan sulfaturia, halitosis, slight photophobia, dyslexia,
mild hearing loss, normal height and mild hepatomegaly
(1 cm) without splenomegaly. Patients presenting with
such mild characteristics are not easily recognized as hav￾ing MPS VI disease until a pattern of findings has been
well established, such as cardiac valve abnormalities, cor￾neal clouding, reduced endurance and repeated respira￾tory and sinus infections atypical for a normal age￾matched group, and spine, hip or hand skeletal disease.
The pathophysiology is similarly related to progressive
accumulation of GAG that affects structure and function
of involved organs but is due to a lower concentration of
primary storage material than in rapidly progressing dis￾ease, and consequently leads to a slower rate of clinical
progression.
Skeletal Disease
The radiological findings that are characteristic of MPS
VI, other MPS, mucolipidoses (ML II I-Cell disease/
Leroy, ML III (pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy) and other
storage diseases (multiple sulfatase deficiency, carbohy￾drate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome, GM I gangliosi￾dosis and geleophysic dysplasia) are given the term
"dysostosis multiplex". Typical radiological findings
include thickened, short metacarpal bones (Fig 7) with
proximal pointing and thin cortices, carpal bones that are
irregular and hypoplastic and tarsal bones that have
irregular contours, a dysplastic femoral head, severe hip
dysplasia (Fig 8), abnormal development of vertebral bod￾ies of the spine (Fig 9), paddle-shaped widened ribs and
short, thick irregular clavicles (Fig 10), hypoplastic distal
ulna and radius (Fig 11), thickened diploic space and
abnormally shaped J-shaped sella in the cranium (Fig 12).
Slowly progressing MPS VI patients may not demonstrate
all the above characteristics of dysostosis multiplex.
Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT)-Related Disease
ENT disease in MPS VI often involves hearing disorders,
otitis media, as well as oral, pharyngeal, and upper airway
obstruction. The general pathophysiology of ENT disease
in MPS is related to GAG deposition in mucosae and in
other tissue layers such as those of tongue and tonsils,
with progressive airway narrowing of the nasopharynx
and oropharynx[30]. Increased production of mucous
secretions leads to rhinorrhea, sinus infections, and otitis
media by occluding sinus drainage and blockage of the
Eustachian tubes. Permanent hearing loss is common and
believed to be conductive and neurosensory in nature.

of excessive tissue into the larynx may cause stridor and
compromise airways[22].
Upper airway obstruction leading to obstructive sleep
apnea is a common morbidity; sleep apnea is assessed
using polysomnography.
Special precautions with general anesthesia and surgery
surround the short stiff neck, large amount of obstructing
oral pharyngeal and upper airway tissue, and risk of spi￾nal cord injury if neck is hyperextended. It is recom￾mended that tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy and other
head and neck surgical procedures be performed without
extending the neck. For the same reason, normal intuba￾tion for anesthesia is not usually possible and should only
be performed by anesthesiologists skilled in flexible bron￾choscopy-assisted intubation and who are aware of the
severe difficulties that are present in these patients [31-
33].
Pulmonary Disease
Patients with MPS VI may have features of obstructive
and restrictive lung disease. The obstructive lung disease
is related to narrowed bronchial airways [30] and trache￾obronchomalacia, a weakness that can lead to acute air￾way obstruction or collapse, whereas the restrictive lung
disease is due to a small, stiff thoracic cage, and abdomi￾Figure 9 Rapidly progressing 8-year old male MPS VI patient: ra￾diograph of spinal column showing abnormal development of

nal distention, combined with kyphosis, scoliosis, and
increased lumbar lordosis[34].
Disease complications include recurring episodes of
pneumonia. Evaluation of pulmonary function by
spirometry including flow-volume expiratory and
inspiratory loops should be performed regularly to assess
changes in lung volume and obstruction. Reference val￾ues for the normal population may not be appropriate for
use in evaluating MPS VI pulmonary function tests.
However, it is useful to follow absolute respiratory vol￾ume parameters longitudinally. Fiber-optic bronchoscopy
can also be performed to assess severity of airway
obstruction and tracheomalacia. It is particularly helpful
to assess the airway before anesthesia to assist in plan￾ning for this procedure. Vaccinations against respiratory
pathogens causing influenza and pneumococcus infec￾tions should be considered to prevent pneumonia from
these organisms.
Cardiac Disease
Cardiac abnormalities are frequent in patients with MPS
VI and are an important cause of morbidity and mortality
[14,35-37]. Heart disease has been shown using serial
echocardiography to progressively worsen with age in
even the slowly progressive patients[37]. Patients develop
stenosis and/or insufficiency as demonstrated in a study
of 28 MPS VI patients [36] with disease in the mitral
valves (96%), tricuspid valves (71%) and aortic valves
(43%). The literature pertaining to MPS VI reveals cardi￾omyopathy and cardiac failure in a 5-month-old infant
with MPS VI [38] and endocarditis fibroelastosis and car￾diac failure in a 9-month-old with MPS VI [39]. Cardiac
evaluations are recommended every 1 to 2 years and
should include obtaining a blood pressure reading, per￾forming electrocardiography and echocardiography to
assess abnormal cardiac rhythm or conduction abnor￾mality or changes in heart structure or function.
Endocarditis is also a consideration in MPS VI patients
fitted with a mediport (central venous access port) for
infusion of ERT. No literature yet supports infection risk
for MPS VI but the literature for hemophiliacs suggests
that central venous ports have a risk of infection at a rate
of 0.45 per 1000 catheter days. Replacement of aortic and
mitral valves, singly or in combination, has been per￾formed for MPS VI [40] and should be considered for
severe valve stenosis or regurgitation.
Systemic hypertension is common in approximately
20% of MPS I patients and may be considered in those
patients with MPS VI [26]. Hypertension may develop in
relation to aortic or renal artery narrowing or chronic
intermittent hypoxia. The need for antibiotics to prevent
subacute bacterial endocarditis and valvular disease from
surgical interventions and dental procedures should be
discussed with a cardiologist. Although not reported for
MPS VI, there may be a risk of coronary artery disease
based on studies in MPS I patients that suggest additional
care is required during surgery to avoid hypotension and
cardiac ischemia.
Ophthalmological Disease
Ashworth et al (2006) [41] have published a review of the
ophthalmology of the MPS and note that MPS VI patients
were particularly prone to glaucoma (50%) and corneal
clouding (95%), which may be treated with medication
and corneal transplantation surgery, respectively. Thick￾ening of the cornea can result in spurious readings of
high intraocular pressure (IOP) and prevent visualization
of the retina. Increased IOP may be related to narrowing
of the anterior chamber angle by iridociliary cysts (closed
angle glaucoma) or GAG deposition in the trabecular
cells blocking reabsorption (open-angle glaucoma). Cor￾neal transplantation may lead to normalization of spuri￾ous IOP measurements.
Optic nerve abnormalities may be due to GAG accu￾mulation in optic nerve ganglion cells, compression of the
optic nerve by thickened dura or bony narrowing along
the optic nerve tract, or increased intracranial pressure
(ICP). Fifty percent of MPS VI patients have an abnormal
optic disk with mild to moderate swelling; 15% have optic
nerve atrophy. Retinopathy is rare but has been reported
[41,42] and night blindness or dimness may be a reported
symptom.
MPS VI patients should be evaluated annually for stra￾bismus, visual acuity, refraction and IOP by tonometry if
possible. A fundoscopic examination should be per￾formed after dilation to evaluate the retina and optic
nerve; and photographs taken if possible. Visual fields
should be assessed when there are changes in optic nerve
appearance, or if increased IOP is recorded. Visual
evoked-potential examinations may be used to evaluate
the function or health of the optic nerve while severe cor￾neal clouding prevents fundoscopic examination of the
optic disk.
Interventions include corrective lenses, medications,
and/or surgery to control increased IOP, patching for
amblyopia, or surgery to correct strabismus when rele￾vant. In addition, corneal transplantation (penetrating
keratoplasty) may be performed to correct severe corneal
clouding with vision loss. Retinopathy is rare but has
been reported [41,42] and night blindness or dimness
may be a reported symptom.
Central Nervous System Disease
Most MPS VI patients have relatively normal intellectual
development [43], unlike MPS I Hurler, or severe MPS II
Hunter syndrome [21]. Although severe intellectual defi￾cit has been reported in two families with arylsulfatase B
deficiency [44,45], it is not clear that this was caused by

Valayannopoulos et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2010, 5:5
http://www.ojrd.com/content/5/1/5
Page 9 of 20
the MPS disease per se [21]. Valayannopoulos et al 2009,
reported an unusually high prevalence of intellectual def￾icit occurring in 4 of 6 French MPS VI patients followed
at one center[46].
Vedolin et al, (2007) [47] report a study involving 17
MPS VI patients and mentioned a higher cerebral volume
in MPS VI patients compared to other MPS type patients,
and described extensive white matter lesions and ventric￾ular enlargement in some (exact number undisclosed) of
the 17 MPS VI patients. It is not known why MPS VI
patients are spared deficits in cognitive neurological
development [48] although absence of heparan sulfate (a
storage substrate in MPS I, II, III and VII) GAG storage is
probably important.
The frequent vision loss combined with a hearing
impairment due to a combination of conductive and neu￾rosensory loss may contribute to or be misinterpreted as
intellectual impairment in MPS VI patients.
MPS VI patients may also develop communicating
hydrocephalus and increased ICP [49] due to GAG occlu￾sion of the subarachnoid reabsorptive apparatus. Typical
symptoms of communicating hydrocephalus such as
morning headaches and vomiting are often absent,
although some patients may present with rapid visual
deterioration. The diagnosis of increased ICP may be
suggested by computed tomography or MRI although
ventricular dilation may also be related to cortical atro￾phy. Direct measurement of central nervous system pres￾sure may be required for diagnosis. If increased ICP is
documented, a ventriculoperitoneal shunt may prevent
optic atrophy and vision loss in some patients. This rapid
onset of blindness may also be caused by compression
occurring along the optic nerve, and decompression of
this nerve may also be necessary[50].
Patients can also develop cervical spinal cord compres￾sion and injury from bony abnormalities and dural thick￾ening. Spinal cord decompression surgery can help
reduce spinal cord compression and prevent loss of func￾tion. A study of intrathecal delivery of ERT has not yet
been initiated in the setting of MPS VI, although a similar
route of ERT administration was conducted in an MPS I
patient[51].
Etiopathogenesis
MPS VI is an autosomal recessive disease resulting from
mutations in the chromosomal position 5q13-5q14 [2].
Most of the 133 mutations reported by the Human Gene
Mutation Database in June, 2009, are missense or non￾sense mutations (n = 100), and in addition 9 splicing
mutations, 18 small deletions, 3 small insertions, 1 small
"indel"(insertion and deletion), and 2 gross deletions have
also been documented. One of these 133 mutations
(p.T212I) has pseudo-deficient enzyme activity, a normal
phenotype and normal uGAG levels [52].
Disease manifestations are present only in patients with
severe deficiency in enzymatic activity, which is usually
below 10% of the lower limit of normal[29]. The greatest
severity of symptoms is found in patients who have no
detectable enzyme activity. Carriers with only one abnor￾mal allele (the other allele being normal) do not exhibit
any clinical findings due to sufficient activity of ASB
enzyme.
Each disease-causing mutation impacts the production
of a functional ASB enzyme that catalyzes the cleavage of
the sulfate ester from non-reducing terminal N -acetylga￾lactosamine 4-sulfate residues, thereby affecting the
catabolism of sulfated oligosaccharide substrates [3]: CS
and DS. Lengths of DS polysaccharides and oligosaccha￾rides are determined by the relative amount of iduronic
acid relative to glucuronic acid present in the DS chain.
CS is digested by hyaluronidase to sulfated tetrasaccha￾rides that are further reduced by the action of β￾glucuronidase to sulfated trisaccharides with non-reduc￾ing end N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate residues that
accumulate as undigested substrate (J Hopwood, per￾sonal communication). The glucuronic acid residues
enable the hyaluronidase digestion of the DS chains to
oligosaccharides with non-reducing end β-linked
glucuronic acid residues that may be removed by the
action of β-glucuronidase. DS, also known as chondroitin
sulfate B [53], is a necessary component in the formation
of structural proteins that form connective tissue, such as
collagen and bone.
The rapidly progressing feline MPS VI model (used to
demonstrate efficacy of enzyme replacement therapy
[54,55]), is due to the homozygous presence of p.L476P
mutation and expresses approximately 0.3% of normal
white blood cell ASB activities [56]. This severe pheno￾type includes dwarfism, facial dysmorphia, degenerative
joint disease, corneal clouding, lysosomal inclusions in
most tissues including chondrocytes and abnormal leu￾kocyte inclusions. The compound heterozygous presence
of a mild mutation p.D520N with p.L476P enables the
expression of approximately 1% of normal white blood
cell ASB activity. The phenotype of the compound
heterozygote includes clear corneas, normal connective
tissue inclusions, mild inclusions in chondrocytes, mild
joint disease and normal skeletal growth [57]. This dou￾ble heterozygote identifies the limit of ASB activity
needed to prevent MPS VI skeletal disease in the cat as
approximately 1% of normal white blood cell ASB.
Homozygous presentation of the p.D520N mutation,
associated with the expression of approximately 2% of
normal white blood cell activity, leads to disease-free cats
although inclusion bodies can be identified in neutro￾phils. Thus in cats, the range of 0.3% to 2% of normal ASB
activity in white blood cells covers the range of clinical
severity of the MPS VI phenotype [57].

Accumulation of GAG DS causes lysosomal engorge￾ment, cell enlargement and dysfunction in animal models
of MPS VI, as is found in human MPS VI [21]. The accu￾mulation of DS specifically is the primary pathological
defect. Secondary pathological processes also play an
important role in pathophysiology. GAG has been shown
to stimulate inflammatory response in articular chondro￾cytes through lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated signal￾ing [58-60] in animal models of MPS disease. GAG has
been shown to play a similar role in other connective tis￾sue diseases [61].
Problems with Genotype-Phenotype Correlations
It has been difficult to determine genotype-phenotype
correlation for most patients. This results primarily
because a large number of mutations have been identified
and in most cases patients have either a novel or private
mutation or share a mutation with one or two individuals
and clear descriptions of the phenotype were not pro￾vided. As an autosomal recessive disease, MPS VI
requires the presence of two mutated copies of the ARSB
gene, located on chromosome 5 for disease expression. If
a patient has the same ARSB mutation on each one of his
chromosome 5, the patient is homozygous and there
exists the best chance of making a genotype-phenotype
correlation. If the patient has two different ARSB muta￾tions, one on each chromosome 5, the patient is com￾pound heterozygous. In this case, it is more difficult to
determine the phenotype. In addition a polymorphism
may be present on the same gene as an MPS VI mutation,
acting as a second factor that may modify the disease pro￾gression of the pathologic mutation. Finally, there are a
few documented occurrences where 2 or more disease￾causing mutations are located on a single allele [62,63].
Historically Jin et al, (1992) [48] were the first to report
mutations of the ARSB gene in rapidly progressing and
slowly progressing phenotypes and suggested that geno￾type-phenotype correlations might be possible. Wicker et
al, (1991) [18] described a report of a homozygous G137V
mutation for an intermediate clinical phenotype with low
but residual ASB enzyme activity, although no clinical
description was given. Litjens et al, (1992) [64] reported a
patient homozygous for an early frameshift mutation
caused by the deletion of a G at position 238 (ΔG238) with
a description of a rapidly progressing MPS VI phenotype
as having a grossly elevated level of DS, deficiency of ASB
in skin fibroblasts and peripheral blood leukocytes. The
severe clinical features, which were noticeable within the
first 2 days of age included dysmorphic facial features and
dysostosis multiplex with abnormal vertebrae, small
flared iliac wings, diphyseal distension of tubular bones
and a large skull as the most prominent features. By 3
months of age the patient had corneal clouding, which
worsened by 7 years of age leading to blindness. By 4
years of age the patient's upper airway obstruction was
relieved somewhat by tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy.
Also at 4 years of age the degree of hydrocephalus
required shunting. At the age of 5 years joint contractures
at the knees were relieved by surgery. By 6 years of age
instability of the C2 and C3 vertebrae led to cervical cord
compression, which required stabilization of these verte￾brae. At age 11 years the patient underwent proximal
femur extension osteotomies to relieve fixed flexion
deformities of the hips bilaterally.
Despite limitations in genotype-phenotype correla￾tions, progress has been made in developing technologies
to assess or predict the impact of specific mutations on
enzyme levels and activity. After molecular genetic analy￾sis on DNA extracted from patients' skin fibroblasts using
direct sequencing techniques to identify the ARSB muta￾tions, these mutations were expressed in Chinese ham￾ster ovary cells and analyzed for residual ASB activity and
mutant ASB protein [15,65-68]. A second method has
been developed to estimate the severity of missense
mutations using 3-D visualization with Ras-Mol v2.7.3.1.
software [69,70] to predict the effect of mutated amino
acid substitutions on protein structure and function.
For nonsense mutations and deletions that disrupt pro￾tein production and cause enzyme deficiency the severity
is clear. Missense mutations are harder to predict and
need to be assessed directly with cell transfection and
expression experiments or 3D modeling as described
above to understand the impact of the mutation on the
phenotype. Recently, ARSB DNA from a large MPS VI
population representing approximately 10% of all known
MPS VI patients has been sequenced. The study presents
correlates of some genotypes with phenotype that have a
much improved clinical phenotype description[15].
Despite some success making genotype-phenotype cor￾relations for homozygous individuals, it is still not gener￾ally possible to predict phenotype from genotype[71]. For
example, a case of two rapidly progressing mutations
p.T92M and p.L498P in a compound heterozygote patient
was described by Litjens et al, (1996) [72] that resulted in
a slowly progressing phenotype. These alleles were subse￾quently expressed in a mammalian cell expression sys￾tem, but the residual ASB activity and/or ASB protein
representing the biochemical phenotype did not corre￾spond to the observed clinical phenotype. Furthermore,
the presence of two [62] or even three [63] disease-caus￾ing mutations in a single allele are reported and have
been associated with rapidly progressing phenotype in
MPS VI with concomitant high uGAG and low residual
ASB activity. Recently a few correlations of phenotype to
genotype, or correlation of elevated uGAG levels to geno￾type, have been described in the literature and are dis￾cussed below. Karageorgos et al 2007 [15] have identified
the mutations for 105 patients participating in the cross-

Page 11 of 20
sectional survey of untreated MPS VI patients, and Phase
1, Phase 1/2 clinical trials. The Karageorgos study has
identified 83 different disease-causing mutations, 62 of
which were novel, with 11 deletions, 1 insertion, 7 splice
site mutations, 4 polymorphisms, 5 nonsense and 38 mis￾sense mutations.
Rapidly Progressing Genotype-Phenotype
The literature prior to the Karageorgos study revealed
some well-studied homozygous missense mutations,
deletions and insertions, and intronic mutations that had
shown reasonable correlation to rapidly progressing phe￾notypes with severe symptoms: i.e., p.C117R [48]; ΔG238
[64]; p.G144R; p.C521Y; insertion T1285 [19]; and
pL321P [62]. The Karageorgos study (2007) [15] provided
additional mutations associated with severe phenotypes,
with 3 homozygous forms; rapidly progressing clinical
phenotypes were associated with missense mutations
p.D54N, p.L98Q, and p.I223V. Also early onset, rapid
progression, elevated uGAG with low ASB protein and
activity levels were found in the same study to be associ￾ated with missense mutations p.L72R, and p.R315Q
linked to the polymorphism p.S384N but caution should
be taken when genotyping reveals p.S384N. Although
some publications have reported this mutation to be
associated with a rapidly progressing phenotype [15,63]
there are no expression data available. Futhermore,
Zanetti et al, 2009 recently identified p.S384N with signif￾icant frequency in a normal Italian population and have
shown that p.S384N is a non-pathogenic polymorphism
[73]. (This is also mentioned in the Unresolved Questions
Section at end of document.)
Slowly Progressing Genotype-Phenotype
It is difficult to relate genotype to phenotype for slowly
progressing patients because progressive bone, joint and
cardiac valve symptoms develop more slowly compared
to the rate of symptom presentation for rapidly progress￾ing patients. The Karageorgos study described the atten￾uated clinical phenotype as associated with patients
carrying either the p.Y210C missense mutation or the
p.C405Y missense mutation in independently heterozy￾gous combinations [15]. These mutations were further
associated with levels of uGAG below 100 μg/mg creati￾nine. This group of patients showed later onset and lon￾ger survival than rapidly progressing patients with levels
of uGAG > 100 μg/mg creatinine [15]. No individuals
homozygous for either p.Y210C or p.C405Y mutations
have been reported; it is likely these individuals do not
show signs of MPS disease and remain undetected in the
general population. However, Karageorgos' study pre￾sented a group of patients older than 20 years of age with
attenuated genotype, low uGAG, but poor endurance
results for the 6-min walk test. These findings suggest
that over time even slowly progressing patients may
develop severe morbidity independent of their attenuated
(slowly progressing) genotype. This is attributed to the
accumulation of dermatan sulfate that contributes to pro￾gressive bone and joint disease, and cardiac valve disease.
In particular, the bone and joint disease would impair
performance in the walk test as a measure of endurance.
For these reasons, treatment should not be based on gen￾otype alone. Other mutations associated with uGAG lev￾els below 100 μg/mg creatinine that were associated with
attenuated disease progression were p.R152W[15] and
C192R[19] when present in homozygous state; and
p.D83Y[15], p.H430R[15] and p.R434I[15] when present
in compound heterozygous states.
Diagnosis, diagnostic methods, diagnostic criteria
Diagnosis requires the following:
• the analysis of ASB enzyme activity in isolated leu￾kocytes or cultured skin fibroblasts at an accredited
laboratory [61] to demonstrate large decrease or
absence of ASB activity that is diagnostic for MPS VI.
Although ASB enzyme activity levels may differ
between testing laboratories, ASB activity in diag￾nosed MPS VI patients is generally less than 10% of
the lower limit of normal ASB activity[29].
• the identification of normal enzyme activity of a dif￾ferent sulfatase. This excludes the diagnosis of multi￾ple sulfatase deficiency (MSD).
Diagnosis is supported by the following:
• evidence of clinical phenotype: e.g. short stature,
bone-related dysostosis multiplex, hepatosplenomeg￾aly, macrocephaly, inguinal or umbilical hernia, cor￾neal clouding or cardiac valve thickening. Clinical
phenotype may not be evident in newborns or
patients with a very mild phenotype[29]. It is impor￾tant to note that a pseudo-deficient MPS VI gene
mutation has been reported[52] with the patient
demonstrating very low plasma ASB enzyme activity
(exact level is not yet published), but normal uGAG
and normal skeletal findings by X-ray supporting a
normal phenotype.
• demonstration of elevated total uGAG at baseline
that decreases significantly within 2 to 3 months of
ERT administration, conducted at the same labora￾tory. UGAG are elevated in the newborn period and
decrease over the first year, so this sign of response to
ERT may not be useful in the newborn.
• DS accumulation and absence of CS, heparan sul￾fate, keratan sulfate or hyaluronate using thin layer
chromatography (TLC), or high resolution electro￾phoresis fractionation.
• demonstration by an accredited laboratory of inter￾mediate levels of leukocyte ASB enzyme activity in
both parents to support diagnosis of carriers.

Confirmation by mutational analysis of the ARSB
gene[15] should be considered if the diagnosis is in ques￾tion, and is important in carrier testing or prenatal diag￾nosis.
Differential diagnoses
Differential diagnoses within the MPS and mucolipidoses
families of diseases include:
Mucopolysaccharidosis I H; I S; I H/S (Hurler syn￾drome; Scheie syndrome; Hurler-Scheie syndrome)
Mucopolysaccharidosis II (Hunter syndrome)
Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA (Morquio syndrome)
Mucopolysaccharidosis VII (Sly syndrome)
Multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD)
Mucolipidosis I (now known as sialidosis), II, III, and IV
The mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) I, II, IVA, VII and
multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD), may present early in
life with similar symptoms as MPS VI. For diagnostic
direction to aid in distinguishing MPS VI from other
MPS see Table 2. MPS IVA may be distinguished from
MPS VI by ligamentous laxity [74]. Composition of GAG
substrates in urine may be helpful in differentiating the
different MPS in combination with common differentiat￾ing physical features. MPS I patients typically have less
severe corneal clouding than MPS VI [41]. MPS I may be
differentiated from MPS VI by the excretion of both hep￾aran sulfate and DS in urine in MPS I compared to near
100% DS in MPS VI. MPS II is an X-linked recessive dis￾ease affecting primarily boys, which is differentiated
based upon the absence of corneal clouding and the pres￾ence of heparan sulfate and DS of equal amounts in urine.
MSD may resemble MPS VI in early life but later the ich￾thyosis and mental deficits help differentiate MSD from
MPS VI[75,76]. MSD usually have all GAG types present
in urine since multiple sulfatase activities are simultane￾ously defective. To differentiate MPS VII, these patients
are more often found to have clinical manifestations in
utero or at birth, and corneal clouding is less common at
ages below 8 years. MPS VII is also differentiated based
on uGAG comprised of heparan sulfate, chondroitin 4-,
and 6-sulfates in addition to DS. Mucolipidosis I (better
known as sialidosis), III and IV are differentiated from
MPS VI by absence of increased GAG in urine. ML II may
have increased uGAG with high levels of beta-hexo￾saminidase, iduronate sulfatase and arylsulfatase A at 10-
20 times the reference range in serum but deficiency of
the same enzymes in cultured fibroblasts. [Note: the rele￾vant amount of the detected GAG DS, heparan sulfate
and CS, is often dependent on the method used to assess
uGAG and also the patient's age].
Prenatal Diagnosis, Newborn Screening and 
Genetic Counseling
Prenatal diagnosis is based primarily on reduced/low
ASB activity with optional support of known mutational
analysis for at-risk fetuses where a family already has a
child with MPS VI. Affected members of such a family
usually have the same genotype. Diagnostic testing may
be conducted for prenatal diagnosis on viable fetal cells
from chorionic villi, cultured amniotic fluid cells or in the
newborn on a dried blood spot[77] sampled via the heel
stick method or as recently described, via cordocentesis
[R Giugliani, personal communication], and is available
for MPS VI at a few select laboratories around the
world[78]. Prenatal studies are limited to families having
a previous child with MPS VI.
With the availability of specific FDA-approved thera￾pies for lysosomal storage diseases (Gaucher disease [imi￾glucerase, Cerezyme® U.S. Prescribing Information,
Genzyme Corp., 1994], Fabry disease [agalsidase beta,
Fabrazyme® U.S. Prescribing Information, Genzyme
Corp., 2003], Pompe disease [alglucosidase alfa, Myo￾zyme® U.S. Prescribing Information, Genzyme Corp.,
2006], MPS I [laronidase, Aldurazyme® U.S. Prescribing
Information, BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc./Genzyme
Corp., 2003], and MPS VI [galsulfase, Naglazyme® U.S.
Prescribing Information, BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.,
2005][79]), there is much greater need to have accurate,
early diagnoses. Furthermore, recent studies of galsulfase
administration in MPS VI animal models from
birth[55,80] and in neonatal MPS VI patients from as
young as approximately 8 weeks of age [81] have indi￾cated that very early initiation of ERT leads to better
long-term outcomes[68,8].
Newborn screening is in pilot testing in several collabo￾rating research laboratories in the US, Europe and Aus￾tralia. It is based upon two primary methodologies:
enzyme protein immunoassay based on microbead array
technology or enzyme activity assay detected by tandem
mass spectrometry. Screening assays have already been
described using dried blood spots for other lysosomal
storage disorders with available treatments i.e., MPS II
[82], MPS I, Gaucher, Krabbe, Niemann-Pick A/B, Fabry,
and Pompe diseases [83-86].
Management
Supportive care and surgical intervention
Until recently, supportive care and bone marrow trans￾plantation were the only therapies available for MPS VI
patients. Supportive care has focused on optimizing gen￾eral health with nutrition counseling, occupational and
physical therapy, and management of individual symptom
complications, such as respiratory insufficiency requiring
oxygen and/or positive airway pressure during sleep, ton￾sillectomy, adenoidectomy or tracheostomy, cardiac fail-

ure requiring medication and/or valve replacement if
indicated, spinal cord compression or carpal tunnel com￾pression requiring surgical decompression, corneal
clouding requiring transplantation, or hydrocephalus
requiring insertion of ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Addi￾tional disease management information is contained in
this manuscript in the Clinical Description Section as
well as in more detail in the Management Guidelines for
Mucopolysaccharidosis VI by Giugliani et al, (2007) [26]
and available online [87].
Bone marrow transplantation
Bone marrow or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
(HSCT) has been used in rare cases in the past 24 years to
treat MPS VI [88-95] with one long-term follow-up
reported in four MPS VI patients[96]. Although leuko￾cyte ASB enzyme level and uGAG improve, skeletal
abnormalities remain difficult to stabilize or correct.
Bone marrow transplantation (or HSCT) has been lim￾ited by the risks of death, morbidity from chronic graft￾versus-host disease and difficulty obtaining adequate or
optimal HLA-matched donors [97]. Between 1982 and
2007, there have been 45 MPS VI patients from around
the world, (U.S., Saudi Arabia, Brazil, England, China,
Australia, and Japan), registered with the Center for
International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research
(CIBMTR), and who received allogeneic stem cell trans￾plantation. The 1-year survival for these patients was 67%
(95% CI: 53-80) (CIBMTR, unpublished data).
It will be important in the future to compare long-term
outcomes of MPS VI patients treated with HSCT with
patients treated at an early age with ERT. With the intro￾duction of ERT, two rapidly progressing MPS VI patients
who had previously received HSCT, but who had experi￾enced failure of engraftment were transitioned to ERT,
with no adverse events related to ERT during follow-up
to 36 and 80 weeks, respectively [98].
Enzyme replacement therapy
ERT using genetically engineered human enzyme manu￾factured by recombinant DNA technology in high-output
cell lines is an established treatment for several lysosomal
storage diseases based on the unique ability of human
cells to bind and transport exogenous enzyme into the
lysosomal compartment. In the case of MPS VI, human
ASB is produced and marketed as the drug Naglazyme®
(galsulfase); it utilizes the mannose-6-phosphate receptor
to bind at the cell surface and traffic intracellularly to lys￾osomes, and effectively replaces the absent or deficient
ASB enzyme. Although galsulfase is able to reach most
tissues after IV infusion, the CNS, cornea and articular
cartilage are excluded by the blood-brain barrier or poor
vascularization. Extensive preclinical studies were com￾pleted in a feline model of MPS VI [80] that established
the dose, safety, as well as efficacy in reversing storage,
and limiting bone disease when started very early in life.
These preclinical studies were followed by Phase 1/2,
Phase 2 and Phase 3 human clinical trials [99-102]. Signif￾icant improvements in 12-minute-walk test, nearly signif￾icant improvement in 3-minute stair climb and
significant reduction in uGAG levels were demonstrated
in the 24-week, randomized, double-blind Phase 3 trial
[102]. These studies led to approval of Naglazyme® in the
US (May, 2005), the EU (January, 2006), Australia (March,
2007), Croatia (June, 2007), Switzerland (October, 2007),
South Korea (January, 2008), Japan (March, 2008),
Belarus (August, 2008), Brazil (February, 2009), Algeria
(June, 2009), and Russia (August, 2009). As of September,
2009, Naglazyme® has been marketed in 39 countries.
On long-term follow-up, improvement in endurance on
the walk test and stair climb, and reduction in
uGAG[103], positive effects on puberty and growth
(Decker C et al, unpublished data), and pulmonary func￾tion [104] were maintained in clinical study subjects from
all trials, with observation times up to a maximum of 5
years with regular Naglazyme® therapy. A case study has
shown improvement following ERT of pulmonary func￾tion leading to a reversal of tracheostomy intubation in an
MPS VI patient [24]. Another case study has shown
reversal of papilledema and improved vision in an 11-year
old MPS VI patient followed on ERT maintained during
follow-up of 130 weeks [105]. A case series of 6 MPS VI
patients showed stabilization of visual acuity after treat￾ment with ERT for 144 weeks [106].
ERT with Naglazyme® is generally considered to have an
acceptable safety profile[79]. As is commonly observed
for this class of intravenous protein therapeutics, infusion
reactions have occurred during administration of Nagla￾zyme®
, but are generally mild to moderate in severity, and
can be managed by stopping or slowing infusion, and
administering some combination of pretreatment with
antihistamines, steroids and/or antipyretic agents [107].
More detailed information regarding treatment may be
found in the recently published Management Guidelines
for Mucopolysaccharidosis VI by Giugliani et al, 2007
[26] available on the Internet [87] and in galsulfase,
Naglazyme® U.S. Prescribing Information, BioMarin
Pharmaceutical Inc., 2005[79].
In order to examine the effect of very early ERT on the
skeletal dysplasia and other manifestations of the disease,
a sibling pair with MPS VI was followed. The newborn
infant, who was identified early due to the knowledge that
the first child had been diagnosed with MPS VI, was
started on ERT administered within the first two months
of life [81]. This MPS VI neonate treated from almost 8
weeks of age for 3.6 years showed lack of scoliosis, normal
joint range of motion, and normal cardiac valves as com￾pared to the older sibling started on ERT at 3.6 years of

age and treated with ERT for 3.6 years. The observations
in this sibling study underscore the critical need for early
diagnosis and intervention, which in most cases will
require newborn screening. Further support for early
administration of ERT may be forthcoming from a recent
study of infants started on Naglazyme® (galsulfase) at ages
below 1 year (C Decker, personal communication).
Administration of ERT Naglazyme® is generally per￾formed in a medical setting because of risk of allergic
reaction [107] and the need to have specialized services
to place intravenous access for weekly infusion. Further￾more, care should be taken when considering administra￾tion of prophylactic antihistamines for the prevention of
infusion-associated reactions to ERT since diphenhy￾dramine may result in serious sleep apnea (USPI).
Recently, patients with less severe symptoms and absent
infusion-related reactions have been treated in the home
setting [108-110]. Although this treatment option may
provide improved convenience for some patients, it is
clearly a decision that patient, parent(s) or guardian(s)
and treating physician will need to make together, recog￾nizing the risks of possible allergic reaction and possible
need for placement of permanent central venous access
(i.e., mediport). Central venous access devices have risks
of infection and venous thrombosis. Families should be
aware of these risks and seek medical evaluation with any
unexplained fever, or swelling of face or extremity.
Prognosis
Prognosis probably depends upon age at onset of first
symptoms, rate of disease progression, age at start of
treatment with ERT or HSCT, and experience of medical
and surgical staff caring for the patient. In both rapidly
and slowly progressing forms patients may suffer irre￾versible damage if disease goes undetected and undiag￾nosed, and if ERT initiation is consequently delayed. In
the large Swiedler Survey study of 121 untreated patients
there were fewer patients aged over 20 years, but those
few over 20 years of age were found to have uGAG below
100 μg/mg creatinine; whereas there were substantially
more patients in their teenage years and younger with
uGAG above 100 μg/mg creatinine[14]. Thus, uGAG
above 100 μg/mg creatinine is considered to be a negative
prognostic sign. Slowly progressing patients may gener￾ally survive until the third or later decades. Very long￾term studies documenting the effect of ERT on age of
death have not yet been completed although results of
long-term follow-up while on ERT with respect to endur￾ance-related walk tests and uGAG (92 to 260
weeks)[103], puberty and growth (240 weeks) (Decker C
et al, unpublished data) and pulmonary function (240
weeks) [104] have been submitted, recently accepted or
published by journals at the time of writing. The Clinical
Surveillance Program (CSP) was established by BioMarin
Pharmaceutical Inc. in 2005 to study the natural history
of MPS VI in Naglazyme®
-treated and untreated patients
in the US and EU for a period post-launch of 15 years.
Observations made in this program may provide insight
into the question about the long-term effect of therapy in
the coming years.
Unresolved questions
Correlation of genotype to phenotype and prediction of
severity have limitations due to the low frequency of
homozygosity, high frequency of compound heterozygos￾ity, incomplete identification of polymorphisms, and the
occasional finding of multiple mutations on a single
allele. This is an active area of research and for these rea￾sons the literature is likely to be quickly outdated and
updated frequently on these topics. For example, some
mutations previously associated with rapidly progressing
MPS VI have recently been shown to be common poly￾morphisms. The 1151G > A (p.S384N) mutation was
most often linked to the pathogenic p.R315Q on the same
allele and has been described in MPS VI patients and
family members at risk [70,73]. However, it is important
to note that Garrido et al, 2008 [70] and Zanetti et al,
2009 [73] have subsequently shown that p.S384N is not a
mutation but a non-pathogenic polymorphism. Addition￾ally, p.S384N appears as a polymorphic variant in the
Central European panel of the HapMap (haplotype map￾ping) project [111]. This new finding that p.S384N is non
pathogenic has implications for the future development
of the anticipated newborn screening, and for existing
prenatal diagnosis (in the case of a family with a known
MPS VI child) that may have led in the past to incorrect
correlations of genotype to phenotype regarding these
polymorphisms and mutations. The heterogeneity of
MPS VI and the current inability to consistently and reli￾ably link genotype to phenotype for compound heterozy￾gotes, mean that it is inadvisable to define appropriate
access to specific therapies based on genotype at this
time.
Although ERT with Naglazyme® has been successful in
treating deficits of endurance [103], pulmonary function
[104], growth and puberty (Decker C et al, unpublished
data), it has not been able to resolve the symptoms of
MPS VI disease occurring in certain regions of the CNS,
ophthalmological system and joints due to the limitations
of the blood-brain barrier and comparatively poor vascu￾larization of the joints preventing penetration of enzyme
to these regions. Recent studies that challenge these limi￾tations may lead to future successes. For example there
are recent publications and communications at MPS con￾ferences that report on long-term intra-articular ERT in
MPS VI cats [112,113], combined intrathecal ERT with
intravenous (IV) ERT in MPS VI cats (Auclair D et al,
unpublished data); intrathecal delivery of ERT to the

brain in MPS I dogs [114]; and combined intrathecal ERT
with intravenous (IV) ERT in MPS I dogs from birth
(Dierenfeld A et al, unpublished data). Furthermore there
has been one case study of intrathecal administration of
ERT to an MPS I patient [51] and a case study of intrathe￾cal administration of ERT to an MPS VI patient [115]. All
these reports have shown promising results. Human clin￾ical trials examining these therapeutic approaches are
anticipated but are not yet initiated. MPS animal model
studies from birth in MPS VI cats[55], MPS I dogs (Dick￾son P et al, unpublished data), and a single case study of a
human patient with rapidly progressing form of MPS VI
from the first months of life [81] have shown limited evi￾dence that very early intravenous treatment of MPS VI
disease with ERT can reduce bone disease and improve
skeletal development. Larger trials requiring identifica￾tion of patients through newborn screening will be criti￾cal [116] to prove effectiveness of treatment in preventing
the skeletal dysplasia that is the primary manifestation of
MPS VI disease.
