A B S T R A C T The following study was conducted in
order to define the specific alterations in hepatic ultra￾structure responsible for the decrease in hepatic pro￾tein synthesis associated with experimental diabetes.
Rats received intravenous alloxan (70 mg/kg) and 48
h later were either sacrificed or given insulin for 1, 2,
4, 6, or 24 h. Specimens for electron microscopic evalu￾ation and morphometric analysis were taken from the
same livers used to isolate ribosomes for measurement
of in vitro protein synthesis. Our results show that
hepatocytes from animals with untreated alloxan dia￾betes show varying degrees of disorganization and loss
of rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) which is di￾rectly related to the severity of the alloxan diabetes. A
significant correlation existed between the severity of
ultrastructural changes as judged by the loss of both
membrane and polysome components of the RER and de￾gree of inhibition of protein synthesis (P < 0.001). Ab￾normalities of hepatic ultrastructure and protein synthe￾sis were reversed within 24 h of insulin administration.
The data are consistent with the view that it is the rela￾tive decrease in hepatic polysomes that results from the
loss of RER in alloxan diabetes that is responsible for
the decrease in hepatic protein synthesis.
INTRODUCTION
Previous studies have demonstrated that in vitro hepatic
protein synthesis was markedly depressed when experi￾mental diabetes mellitus was produced in rats (1, 2).
This effect was found to be independent of the method of
producing diabetes (2), and it was, therefore, assumed
that insulin deficiency was responsible for the observed
decrease in protein synthesis. Insulin deficiency has also
been shown to affect the characteristics of isolated he￾patic ribosomes when they are sedimented through a

continuous sucrose gradient (3, 4), as well as to modify
their degree of binding to radiolabeled polyuridylic acid
(3). Both of these latter observations have been inter￾preted as evidence that insulin deficiency is associated
with a decrease in the proportion of hepatic ribosomes
that exist as polyribosomes. It is obvious that such a de￾crease in the hepatic polyribosomal population could be
responsible for the reduced hepatic protein synthesis
seen in acute insulin deficiency, and in an effort to di￾rectly evaluate this possible relationship we have car￾ried out the present study.
Rats were made diabetic by administration of alloxan,
and we then characterized certain qualitative and quan￾titative changes in hepatic ultrastructure that occurred
with acute insulin deficiency, as well as describing the
manner in which these changes are reversed with insulin
replacement. At each stage of insulin deficiency, or re￾placement, we have also correlated the changes that
were observed in hepatic ultrastructure with the in vitro
protein synthetic capacity of ribosomes obtained from
the same livers. In general, a very good correlation ex￾isted between the severity of ultrastructural changes and
measured decreases in in vitro hepatic protein synthesis.
Among the most striking changes in hepatic ultrastruc￾ture that occurred in alloxan diabetes was a fragmenta￾tion and loss of the rough-surfaced endoplasmic reticu￾lum (RER).1 Since the RER constitutes the major
polyribosomal pool of the normal hepatocyte, these
results offer direct evidence that alloxan diabetes results
in a decrease in the hepatic polyribosome population.
METHODS
I. Experimental protocol
Female Sprague-Dawley rats weighing between 180-200 g
were used for all experiments. Animals were given Purina
Laboratory Chow (Ralston Purina Co., St. Louis, Mo.)
1 Abbreviations used in this paper: RER, rough-surfaced
endoplasmic reticulum, SER, smooth endoplasmic reticulum.

and tap water ad lib. except when otherwise indicated.
Blood glucose levels were estimated by use of paper strips
impregnated with glucose oxidase, and read by a Reflectance
.Mleter2 (5). All animals were placed into one of the fol￾lowing four treatment groups.
1) Controls. Animals in this group were fasted for 18 h,
then injected with 0.5 ml saline into the tail vein. They
were allowed to eat freely, and were killed at approximately
noon 48 h later, at the same time as the alloxanized animals
for whom they served as controls. Controls for insulin￾treated animals were injected with saline at the same time
the experimental animals received insulin.
2) Fasted controls. Some rats which were to serve as
controls for alloxanized animals were submitted to a second
fast, which took place the last 18 h of the 48 h experi￾mental period. This group of controls was considered neces￾sary since very sick alloxanized animals often did not con￾sume the normal amount of food from 36 to 48 h after
alloxanization.
3) Alloxan treatment. Rats were given alloxan (70 mg/
kg body weight) by tail vein after an 18 h fast, and were
killed 48 h after injection. Not all injections were techni￾cally perfect, and this may help explain the fact that blood
glucose levels varied from 300 to 1200 mg/100 ml 48 h after
the alloxan was administered. Most rats in this group were
allowed to eat freely during the experimental period, but a
few were forced to fast for the terminal 18 h of the 48 h
experimental period.
4) Insulin replacement. In order to clearly document the
effects of insulin replacement, rats were not selected for
this part of the study unless they were very hyperglycemic
(blood glucose levels > 800 mg/100 ml). Insulin adminis￾tration was started 48 h after alloxan and animals were
sacrificed 1, 2, 4, 6, and 24 h after insulin replacement was
begun. In some instances insulin was not given, and the
surviving rats of this group were killed 24 h later. For
short-term treatment, rats received 1 U regular insulin
(intraperitonally) every 2 h. For 24 h insulin replacement,
a three-step program was followed. During the initial 6 h
period, animals received 1 U of regular insulin (intraperi￾tonally) every 2 h. At this point they received 4 U of lente
insulin (subcutaneously). During the final 6 h they again
received 1 U of regular insulin (intraperitonally) every 2h.
II. Measurement of in vitro protein synthesis
1) Preparation of ribosomes. Rat liver was placed in 50
ml of ice-cold Medium A (0.35 M sucrose, 0.004 M MgCl2,
0.07 M KCl, 0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.0008 M dithio￾threitol). The liver was blotted, weighed, and homogenized
with six strokes at 1000 rpm in a Teflon pestle-ground
glass homogenizer, using 2 vol. Medium B (0.25 M sucrose,
0.05 M Tris-HC1, pH 7.6, 0.005 M MgCl2, 0.025 M KCI).
The homogenate was centrifuged for 15 min at 10,000 g
to prepare a postmitochondrial supernate. The supernate
was decanted and 0.15 ml 10% sodium deoxycholate was
added per ml of supernate to bring the final deoxycholate
concentration to 1.5%. The mixture was then allowed to
stand 20 min on ice. Most pellets were produced by centrifu￾gation of the supernate for 2 h at 105,000 g in a Spinco
L2-65B ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments, Inc., Spinco
Div., Palo Alto, Calif.) Some samples were prepared by
centrifuging through a discontinuous sucrose gradient with
a 0.5 M sucrose layered over 2.0 M sucrose (0.05 M Tris￾HCl, pH 7.6, 0.005 M MgCI2, 0.025 M KCl). These samples
2Ames Co., Elkhart, Ind.
were spun for 8 h at 105,000 g and yielded about one-third
as much RNA as the nongradient samples. Ribosomes pre￾pared by centrifuging through gradients were considerably
more active in carrying out protein synthesis than were
ribosomes prepared in the usual fashion, but the activity
difference between control and diabetic ribosomes remained
when both were prepared through gradients.
2) Incubation of ribosomes. A detailed description of
the method with which incorporation of [3H]phenylalanine
into protein was measured has been published earlier (2).
In general, a suspension of ribosomes of known RNA con￾tent was added to an incubation medium with a pH 5 frac￾tion obtained from normal liver, amino acids, [3H]phenyl￾alanine, GTP, ATP, phosphoenolpyruvate, and pyruvate
kinase, with dithiothreitol used as a sulfhydryl stabilizer.
Conditions of the incubation were such that the ribosomes
were the rate-limiting factor for incorporation of amino acid
into protein. Timed portions of the incubation sample were
withdrawn and placed on filter papers, the protein precipi￾tated by the addition of cold 10% TCA, and the disks
washed to extract nonprotein radioactivity (6). The disks
were then dried and counted in a liquid scintillation spec￾trometer. Ribosomal RNA was measured by the method
of Schneider (7) and protein-synthetic activity was ex￾pressed as counts per minute of [3H]phenylalanine incorpo￾rated into protein per milligram RNA in the incubated
sample after a 30 min incubation. Ribosomes from control,
alloxan, and alloxan plus insulin-treated rats were always
prepared and incubated concurrently, and experimental re￾sults were expressed as a percentage of the synthetic ac￾tivity of the control tissue prepared and assayed the same
day.
III. Preparation of tissue for electron microscopy
The rats used for study were stunned by a blow on the
head and exsanguinated through the chest. Tiny pieces of
tissue were taken from the right lobe of the liver and
processed by one or more of the following procedures: (a) fixation for 1i h at 4°C in 1% osmium tetroxide buffered
at pH 7.0 with Millonig's phosphate buffer. This procedure
was used for general tissue fixation; (b) fixation for 11 h
at 4°C in 1% osmium tetroxide buffered at pH 7.0 with
0.1 M veronal acetate buffer followed by 1 h postfixation
at 22°C in 0.5% uranyl acetate buffered at pH 6.0 in 0.1 M
veronal acetate buffer. This procedure selectively empha- sized cytomembranes while it eliminated the staining of
glycogen; and (c) fixation for 2 h at 22°C in 4% osmium
tetroxide in distilled water, pH 7. This procedure particu- larly emphasized the presence of free, nonmembrane-bound
polysomes. All specimens were rapidly dehydrated in a
graded series of alcohols, followed by propylene oxide, and
embedded in a mixture of Epon and Araldite plastic.
IV. Morphometric studies
Liver specimens were taken from four rats of each of
the following categories for morphometric studies: (a) controls, (b) 48-h alloxan-treated rats with blood glucose levels > 800 mg/100 ml, and (c) 48-h alloxanized rats with
blood glucose levels > 800 mg/100 ml which had been
treated with insulin for 24 h. The liver specimens were
processed (as in section IIIa) and prepared for morpho- metric analysis as described by Loud (8, 9). Thick sections from the surface layers of plastic-embedded blocks of liver
were stained with toluidine blue and used for locating mid￾zonal hepatocytes and for measuring the average cell size

of nucleated hepatic parenchymal cells. The specimen blocks
were retrimmed after selection of the appropriate cells and
thin, silver-gray sections were taken of three different blocks
from each of the 12 animals and stained with uranyl acetate
and Reynolds' lead citrate. Electron micrographs of very
low magnification (X 3000) were taken of sections of these
36 blocks and suitable areas of the micrograph plates were
enlarged fivefold and printed on 11 X 14 in paper. Parallel
sampling lines spaced 2.54 cm apart were drawn on each
print and the percent volume occupied by mitochondria,
glycogen, and lipid droplets was estimated from the frac￾tional length of sampling lines covered by these cellular com￾ponents (8-10). RER length per area cytoplasm (propor￾tional to area RER per volume cytoplasm) was estimated
by the following formula (8-10):
=rX CX M
2 X 1000 X I
in which L represents the RER in micrometers per square
micrometer cytoplasm; C, the number of intersections of
RER profiles with the sampling lines; M, the total mag￾nification of the photographic print; and 1, the sum of the
length of sampling lines measured in millimeters.
RESULTS
I. In vitro protein synthesis
Studies of the effect of insulin deficiency and replace￾ment on the capacity of isolated hepatic ribosomes to in￾corporate labeled phenylalanine into protein in a cell￾free amino acid incorporating system were carried out
on rats whose blood glucose levels were greater than 800
mg/100 ml 48 h after receiving alloxan. At this point
the rats were either killed or started on insulin replace￾ment and killed, 1, 2, 4, 6, or 24 h later. In several in￾stances insulin was not replaced, and the surviving rats
were also killed 24 h later. The effect of this degree of
alloxan diabetes on the protein synthetic capacity of
isolated hepatic ribosomes is illustrated in Fig. 1, in
which ribosomes from the liver of a normal and dia￾betic rat are compared. In order to avoid the effects of
day to day variations in the preparation and incubation
of ribosomes, control and experimental ribosomes were
always prepared and incubated concurrently. For the
same reason, the experimental results were expressed
as the percentage of the protein-synthetic activity of the
control tissue prepared and assayed the same day. The
results of 35 such comparisons are summarized in Fig. 2.
These results indicate that the effect of alloxan diabetes
is to reduce hepatic protein synthesis to approximately
55% of control values. No perceptible improvement in
hepatic protein synthesis was observed during the first
few hours after insulin replacement, but by 6 h some
evidence of repair could be detected and hepatic protein
synthesis had completely returned to values for control
animals 24 h after beginning insulin. It should be noted
that no improvement was seen in 24 h when insulin was
not replaced.
II. Ultrastructural details
The ultrastructure of livers from rats with alloxan
diabetes differed in may ways from normal. In an effort
to clearly define there differences, we will describe the
ultrastructural details under four general headings.

Hepatic Ultrastructure and Protein Synthesis in Diabetes 251

Typically, normal hepatocytes sectioned through a cen￾tral area show several such zones. Each complex con￾sists of up to 20 parallel cisternae of ribosome-studded
endoplasmic reticulum membranes. Mitochondria may be
randomly distributed throughout this zone. Tangentially
cut membranes of endoplasmic reticulum are shown in
Fig. 4a revealing the underlying shadow of the sec￾tioned membrane and the characteristic spiral or rosette
pattern of the membrane-bound polysome cut at this
angle (11). Ribosomes also occur free in the cytosol of
the normal hepatocyte as monoribosomes or in clusters,
presumably as polyribosomes. Such clusters of poly￾ribosomes may be located between the cisternal units of
RER and in favorable sections, as in Fig. 4b, they can
be differentiated from the membrane-associated poly￾somes cut tangentially, as in Fig. 4a.
In the normal hepatocyte, glycogen is found in
specialized regions of the cytoplasm normally occupied
by the loose framework of tubules and channels of the
smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) (11). The gen￾eral location of glycogen within the hepatocyte can be
well seen in Fig. 3, in which glycogen is stained, but
the particular relationship of glycogen to the SER is
more clearly demonstrated in Fig. 5, in which glycogen
is not stainied. The typical fine structure of the mito￾chondria in a normal hepatocyte can be seen in Fig. 3.
Column I of Table I summarizes some relevant mor￾phometric data from normal midzonal hepatocytes of
our group of rats. The figures represent an average of
measurements taken from a total of 12 micrographs
(i.e., one micrograph from each of three blocks from
each of four different control animals). The values are
roughly comparable with those reported by Loud (9)
in fed rats of a different strain.
2) Fasted rats. Electron micrographs of livers from
control rats fasted 18 h (Fig. 6) showed some minor
alterations of the structures just described. In compar￾ing Fig. 6 with Fig. 3 (normal control) it can be seen
that fasting produces some apparent disorganization in
the spatial relationships of the peripheral RER cisternae,
which was independent of the orientation of the speci￾men during sectioning. Fig. 6 also demonstrates that
an 18 h fast results in sufficient depletion of glycogen
from the SER area to reveal the normal loosely ar￾ranged network of tubules of this complex organelle.
3) Alloxanized rats. The changes in rat hepatic ultra￾structure that accompanied alloxan diabetes could be
somewhat arbitrarily subdivided into three general
categories, based upon the degree of variation from
normal. These categories, designated as mild (1 +),
moderate (2 +), and severe (3 +), were also related
in a general fashion to the degree of hyperglycemia,
e.g., the higher the blood glucose, the more severe the
clhange in hepatic ultrastructure.

glucose levels ranged from 400 to 800 mg/100 ml are
illustrated in Fig. 7. It is apparent that the highly or￾ganized RER of the normal hepatocyte (Fig. 3) has
been lost, and that the parallel profiles of ribosome￾studded endoplasmic reticulum membranes have been
replaced by what appeared to be remnants of RER.
(c) Severe diabetes (3+). Hepatocytes from rats
whose blood glucose exceeded 800 mg/100 ml showed
the most striking ultrastructural changes (Figs. 8-10).
The decrease of the RER appeared to be extreme in
this group of animals; only isolated profiles of RER
could still be seen (Figs. 8 and 9). This impression
was confirmed by morphometric analysis of hepatocytes
from these animals in which the area of RER per vol￾ume cytoplasm was found to be significantly (P <
0.001) reduced to roughly one-third the quantity found
in normal hepatocytes (Table I). Although actual
counts were not made of free polyribosomes in these
electron micrographs, there did not appear to be an
equivalent loss of these structures and their relative
abundance can be seen in Figs. 8 and 9. Accompanying
the reduction of RER was a marked proliferation of
SER membranes which took the form of tightly tangled,
branching, and anastomosing channels (Figs. 8 and 10).
Few particles of glycogen remained in these foci of
SER or elsewhere in the cytoplasm. Concentric lamel￾lar formations consisting of tightly packed lengths of
membranes were seen with some regularity in these
hepatocytes (Figs. 8 and 10).
Mitochondria and lipid droplets (Figs. 8 and 10),

of size of alloxanized cells with large amounts of lipid
and very enlarged mitochondria averaged 10% greater
than control cells; the size of alloxanized cells with
little lipid and little enlargement of mitochondria av￾eraged 10%' less than control cells. Since it was impos￾sible to know the state of hydration of these cells at the
time of fixation, no use was ma(le of these figures in
estimating RER in the cytoplasmic space.
d) Insulin-treated rats. Although insulin therapy
ultimately reversed the ultrastructural alterations en￾countered in the liver of alloxanized rats, preliminary
experiments had indicated that the rate at which re￾coverv occurred was clearly dependent on the severity
of diabetes at the onset of insulin administration. For
this reason, rats chosen for critical evaluation of the
benefits of insulin therapy after alloxanization had blood
glucose levels greater than 800 mg/100 ml at the on￾set of treatment. As noted above, alloxan-induced hepatic
ultrastructural changes at this level of hyperglycemia
were consistently severe.
The most immediate effect of insulin was to stimulate
glycogen deposition, and within 6 li after the onset of
insulin administration glycogen was already so exten￾sively associated with areas of SER so as to obscure the
underlying membranous character of this site (Fig.
11). Although the RER appeared far from being re￾paired at this stage, all cells showed accumulations of
polyribosomes and foci of reassembling RER. Mito￾chondria still appeared to be enlarged at this stage.
By 24 h of insulin replacement the hepatocyte ultra￾structure of all animals, even those which previously had
been close to death, showed striking signs of recovery
(Fig. 12 and Table I). Glvcogen deposits occupied a
large proportion of the volume of each cell. Mitochon￾dria were not yet of normal dimensions but somewhat
reduced in size. Although the total quantity of RER
present in the hepatocyte had returned to normal (Ta￾ble I) in many areas (as illustrated in Fig. 12), mem￾branes were not yet found in the parallel array char￾acteristic of normal hepatocytes.

ultrastructure and decreases in hepatic protein￾synthetic capacity
In 33 instances, liver from the same alloxanized ani￾mal was available for both measurement of protein
synthesis and assessment of ultrastructural abnormality.
Included within this group were animals who had re￾ceived insulin replacement. The estimate of the decrease
in hepatic protein synthesis was based upon comparing
the activity of experimental ribosomes to control ribo￾somes, prepared and incubated on the same day. The
percent change in activity was then correlated with an
estimate of the severity of the changes in hepatocyte
morphology that were observed in that same animal.
Decisions as to degree of ultrastructural abnormality
were made without knowledge of the animals' physio￾logical state or of the measured change in protein-syn￾thetic capacity, and each animal was assigned a value
of from 0-3 + on the basis of criteria described earlier.
The relationship between hepatic protein synthesis
and morphological change for these 33 paired obser￾vations is seen in Fig. 12, which clearly indicates the
high degree of correlation (P < 0.001) that existed be￾tween decreases in hepatic protein-synthetic capacity and
relative degrees of abnormality of hepatic ultrastructure.
DISCUSSION
The results that have been presented confirm earlier
studies which indicated that ribosomal preparations
from rats with experimental diabetes mellitus were less
capable of incorporating a radiolabeled amino acid into
protein than were similar preparations obtained from
normal rats (1, 2). These estimates of protein-syn￾thetic activity do not tell us how experimental diabetes
produces this decrease in protein synthesis, and it was
in order to gain insight in this regard that led us to di￾rectlv examine the changes in hepatic ultrastructure
that occur in alloxan diabetes. Since there was no a
priori reason to assume that changes in hepatic mor￾phology are necessarily related to effects of experimental
diabetes on hepatic protein synthesis, the extremely sig￾nificant degree of correlation that was shown to exist
(Fig. 13) between decreases in hepatic protein synthesis
and ultrastructural abnormalities was reassuring. Ob￾viously, this does not mean that the two variables are
causally related, and it seems unlikely that changes in
hepatic morphology such as loss of glycogen or accumu￾lation of lipid are responsible for the decrease in hepatic
protein synthesis. On the other hand, the observation
that the RER is reduced to approximately one-third nor￾mal values in rats with acute alloxan diabetes seems tot

-offer a reasonable explanation for the concomitant de￾crease in protein synthesis. Since the great majority of
*hepatocyte polyribosomes are normally bound to the
endoplasmic reticulum membranes, the disruption, frag￾mentation, and eventual loss of the RER that occurs
with alloxan diabetes would result in a marked loss of
hepatic polyribosomes. It seems reasonable to assume
that as this process is going on that there would be a
disaggregation of larger polyribosomes to smaller com￾ponents. As a result, there would be a decrease in the
proportion of hepatic ribosomal RNA present as large
polyribosomes and an increase in the proportion present
as smaller polyribosomes, monoribosomes, and ribosomal
subunits. Since this latter group of ribosomal com￾Hepatic Ultrastructure and Protein Synthesis in Diabetes 259

ponents is less active in protein synthesis, a decrease
in protein synthesis per milligram of ribosomal RNA
would result from this change in the hepatic ribosomal
population. Thus, it appears that the decrease in hepatic
protein synthesis that occurs with alloxan diabetes can
result from the disruption and loss of RER, and the
simplest explanation is that it is due to a decrease
in the proportion of hepatic ribosomes which are bound
to messenger RNA and exist as polyribosomes. This.
hypothesis is also consistent with earlier (2), more in￾direct studies of the effect of experimental diabetes on
hepatic protein synthesis, on polysome profiles (3, 4),.
and the binding affinity of ribosomes from diabetic ani--
mals for polyuridylic acid (3).

Obviously, the validity of conclusions as to the effect
of experimental diabetes upon hepatic protein synthesis
are contingent upon the premise that the observed
changes are due to insulin deficiency and not pharmaco￾logical effects of the agents used to induce diabetes. In
this regard, it appears that diabetes induced by either
alloxan (2), anti-insulin serum (2), or streptozotocin3
produces equivalent reductions of hepatic protein syn￾thesis. On the other hand, since disorganization and
dissolution of the RER is a common result of hepatic
injury caused by a wide variety of chemical agents and
other stimuli (12), it is possible that the morphological
changes we observed could be due to a direct effect of
alloxan on the liver. In a similar fashion, the striking
changes in mitochondrial size that we and others (13-
15) have seen after the induction of alloxan diabetes
could also result from a toxic effect of alloxan. How￾ever, all the abnormalities that we observed, even
though extremely severe, were rapidly reversible after
insulin administration. For example, within 6 h after
insulin administration glvcogen deposition was readily
apparent and all cells showed accumulations of ribosomes
and foci of reassembling RER. By 24 h of insulin re￾placement, the hepatocyte ultrastructure and morpho￾logic characteristics ap)proached normal. In contrast.
continued deterioration of all aspects of hepatocyte ul￾trastructure occurred in alloxanized rats that did not
receive insulin replacement. Since there is no reason to
believe that insulin replacement would have any bene￾ficial effect on hepatocyte damage caused directly bv
alloxan, it seems reasonable to assume that experi￾mental diabetes, not the toxic effect of alloxan, is re￾sponsible for the changes in hepatic ultrastructure and
protein synthesis that we have described.
Although Wool and colleagues (16) have reported
somewhat analogous effects of alloxan diabetes on the
in vitro protein-synthetic capacity of muscle ribosomes,
there appears to be significant differences in the manner
in which experimental diabetes modifies protein syn￾thesis in the two tissues. In the first place, we have
previously pointed out that there are differences in the
way in which polyuridylic acid modifies protein syn￾thesis in hepatic as compared with muscle ribosomes ob￾tained from diabetic rats (3). Secondly, insulin re￾placement in alloxanized rats can return muscle protein
synthesis to normal within minutes (16), in contrast to
the number of hours it took to reverse changes we noted
in hepatic ultrastructure and protein synthetic capacity.
Thirdly, there appears to be a difference in the ribo￾somal population affected by experimental diabetes.
Since the great majority of the ribosomes present in
muscle are free in the cytosol, the reduced activity of
muscle ribosomes resulting from diabetes must be due

to an effect of insulin deficiency on these fIree" ribo￾somes. In contrast, our results strongly suggest that
changes in the "bound" ribosomal population are re￾sponsible for the defect in hepatic protein synthesis that
resulted from alloxan diabetes.
The physiological significance of these differences is
not immediately apparent, nor indeed is it clear as to
the significance of the fact that alloxan diabetes seems
to have effected the two ribosomal populations of the
liver in a different fashion. One possible explanation
for the latter phenomenon may be related to the fact
that a major effect of diabetes on the liver is to in￾crease the activity of several enzymes necessary for new
glucose production (17). It seems possible that the
changes observed in hepatocytes of rats with experi￾mental diabetes may be viewed as a reflection of this
process. Glycogen depletion in the diabetic animal is ex￾tensive. The amount of RER is drastically reduced, sug￾gesting a curtailment in the synthesis of plasma albu￾min and other export proteins not essential for glucose
production. On the other hand, there is extensive devel￾Hepatic Ultrastructure and Protein Synthesis in Diabetes 2961

-opment of the SER. The association of glucose-6-phos￾phatase with SER is now well established (18, 19), and
it is possible that the observed increase in development
of this organelle in the insulin-deficient animal is re￾lated to the recognized physiological need for this glu￾coneogenic enzyme. Obviously, the answer to these
various questions will come only from further experi￾ments. The issues are raised here primarily to emphasize
the fact that significant and selective changes in the
protein-synthetic activities of liver and muscle do oc￾cur as a result of experimental diabetes, and that we
currently have very little insight as to the physiological
significance of these changes.
