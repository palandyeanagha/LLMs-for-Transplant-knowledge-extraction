Abstract
Background: Recent studies reported that patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) might have liver
injury. However, few data on the combined analysis and change patterns of alanine aminotransferase (ALT),
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and total bilirubin (TBil) have been shown.
Methods: This is a single-center retrospective study. A total of 105 adult patients hospitalized for confirmed COVID￾19 in Beijing Ditan Hospital between January 12, and March 17, 2020 were included, and divided into mild group
(n = 79) and severe group(n = 26). We compared liver functional test results between the two groups. Category of
ALT change during the disease course was also examined.
Results: 56.2% (59/105) of the patients had unnormal ALT, AST, or total TBil throughout the course of the disease,
but in 91.4% (96/105) cases the level of ALT, AST or TBil ≤3 fold of the upper limit of normal reference range (ULN).
The overall distribution of ALT, AST, and TBil were all significantly difference between mild and severe group
(P < 0.05). The percentage of the patients with elevated both ALT and AST was 12.7% (10/79) in mild cases vs.
46.2% (12/26) in severe cases (P = 0.001). 34.6% (9/26) severe group patients started to have abnormal ALT after
admission, and 73.3% (77/105) of all patients had normal ALT before discharge.
Conclusions: Elevated liver function index is very common in patients with COVID-19 infection, and the level were
less than 3 × ULN, but most are reversible. The abnormality of 2 or more indexes is low in the patients with COVID￾19, but it is more likely to occur in the severe group.

Background
Core clinical features in patients with coronavirus
disease-2019 (COVID-19) include fever, dry cough and
asthenia. Patients with severe illness often experience
dyspnea and/or hypoxemia within one week after symp￾tom onset, and the mortality rate is about 1–3% [1].
Liver biochemical abnormalities have been documented
in COVID-19 patients, and typically include mild eleva￾tions of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate
aminotransferase (AST), ranging from 14 to 53% [1–4].
Patients with severe illness, and particularly those re￾quiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission, tend to have
higher rate of transaminase elevation than in those with
mild to moderate illness [4, 5]. No studies have reported
the incidence of concurrent elevation of serum transami￾nases and total bilirubin (TBil) in patients with COVID￾19. Also, few studies examined the dynamic change of
liver function throughout the course of COVID-19.

Methods
Study design
This is a single-center retrospective study. Medical records
were screened to identify adult patients receiving treatment
for confirmed COVID-19 at Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital
Medical University, from January 12, 2020 to March 17,
2020. The cases were divided into mild group (mild and or￾dinary type, n = 79) vs. severe group (severe and critical
type, n = 26) according to their condition [6]. This study
was approved by the Ethics Committee of Beijing Ditan
Hospital, Capital Medical University (#2020–010-01).
Patient selection
For inclusion in the analysis, patients must be ≥18 years
of age. The diagnosis and classification (into mild vs. se￾vere cases) of COVID-19 was based on the “New Cor￾onavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment Plan
(Trial Edition 4–6)” published by the Chinese Health
and Health Council [6]. Mild type was defined as lack of
signs for pneumonia based on image results. Ordinary
type was defined as having fever and respiratory symp￾toms radiologic signs of pneumonia. Severe type was de￾fined as the presence of any of the following: respiratory
distress (respiratory rate > 30 times/min), oxygen satur￾ation SpO2 (resting state) ≤ 93%, abnormal blood gas
analysis: partial arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2)/fraction
of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ≤ 300 mmHg. Critical type was
defined as the presence of any of the following: respira￾tory failure that requires mechanical ventilation, shock,
accompanied by other organ failure that needs ICU ad￾mission. COVID-19 was based on PCR for the SARS￾CoV-2 gene using nasal or pharyngeal swabs taken prior
to admission. All patients received at least one chest CT
scan after admission. The criteria for discharge from
hospital included: Normal body temperature for at least
3 days; resolution of respiratory symptoms; chest CT
showing improvement in lung inflammation; two￾negative RT-PCR results for SARS-CoV2 respiratory
samples at least 24 h apart [6].
Exclusion criteria: 1) Patients who were still hospital￾ized in Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical Univer￾sity until March 17, 2020. 2) The patients did not have
complete medical history, and in particular, liver func￾tion tests were not performed during hospitalization.
Data collection
The following information was extracted from the medical
records: sex, age, alcohol use, time of onset, hospital stay
and existing diseases. Standard liver blood chemistry was
conducted at admission as well as during hospitalization.
Some patients also underwent abdominal ultrasound
examination. The normal reference ranges were: 1) ALT:
male 9.0–50.0 U/L, female 7.0–40.0 U/L; 2) AST: male
15.0–40.0 U/L, female 13.0–35.0 U/L; 3) TBil: 0-
18.8 μmol/L; 4) albumin (ALB): 40.0–55.0 g/L; 5) cholin￾esterase (CHE): 4000–11,000 U/L.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS (Ver￾sion 17.0). Categorical variables were presented as per￾centages, and continuous variables as means + standard
deviations (SD) or medians and inter-quartile ranges
Fig. 1 The flow of patient enrollment. From January 12, 2020 to March 17, 2020, 199 patients were admitted to Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital
Medical University. One hundred twenty three patients were discharged and 1 patient was died of COVID-19. One hundred nine patients were
old than 18 years. But data of 4 patients were incomplete. At last, 105 patients were enrolled into this study
Wang et al. Military Medical Research (2020) 7:28 Page 2 of 8

(IQR, 25-75th). Comparisons between groups were made
by using chi-square test for mortality or differences in
categorical variables and Student’s t-test or Wilcoxon
rank sum test for continuous variables, as appropriate.
P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Patient selection process
A total of 105 patients were included in this study, ac￾counting for 52.8% of the patients receiving treatment for
COVID-19 at Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical Uni￾versity from January 12, 2020 to March 17, 2020. Patient
selection for inclusion in the analysis is shown in Fig. 1.
Clinical characteristics at admission
The results of clinical characteristics at admission are
presented in Table 1. The median age was 45.0 years
(IQR: 33.5, 59.5; range: 18 to 92) in the entire cohort,
41.0 years (IQR: 33.0, 56.0) in mild cases (n = 79) and
59.0 years (48.5, 69.8) in severe cases (n = 26) (P < 0.001).
The male-female ratio was 1:1 in mild cases and 2.2:1 in
severe cases (P = 0.073). The time from symptom onset
to hospital admission was 4.0 days in the mild cases vs.
7.0 days in severe cases (P = 0.005). The median hospital
stay was 22.0 days in the entire cohort, 20.0 days in mild
cases vs. 31.5 days in severe cases (P = 0.001).
A total of 89 out of 105 patients underwent abdominal
ultrasound scans for fatty liver. Fatty liver was detected
in 40.0% of the mild cases vs. 45.8% in severe cases (P =
0.636). One patient had extended history of heavy alco￾hol use (ethanol consumption at > 40 g/d). All patients
denied a history of chronic hepatitis B or chronic hepa￾titis C. HBsAg, anti-HCV, anti-HIV, and syphilis-specific
antibodies were tested in 22 patients; the results showed

positive anti-HCV but no HCV RNA in one patient.
Among the 37 patients with fatty liver, 11 (29.7%) had
elevated ALT; 6 (21.6%) were mild cases and 5 (13.5%)
were severe cases. In 9 out of the 11 cases, ALT eleva￾tion was < 2 × ULN (upper limit of normal reference
range); the highest ALT level was 129.9 U/L. We did not
perform statistical analysis due to the small sample size.
The analysis results of liver functions at admission are
also presented in Table 1. Seventeen out of 105 patients
(16.2%) elevated ALT. The median ALT level was 22.0
U/L in mild cases vs. 27.8 U/L in severe cases (P =
0.088). However, there was no difference in the distribu￾tion of ALT at different levels between the two groups
(P = 0.482). The highest ALT was 357.0 U/L, which was
appeared on a male mild group patient. AST, TBil, CHE,
and ALB levels were available in 50 patients only. The
median AST was 22.0 U/L in mild cases vs. 46.3 U/L in
severe cases (P < 0.001). The rate of isolated AST eleva￾tion was higher at 63.6% in severe cases vs. 5.1% in mild
cases (P < 0.001). AST was elevated at ≥2 × ULN in one
severe cases. The median TBil was 10.0 μmol/L in mild
cases vs. 10.6 μmol/L in severe cases (p = 0.535). Among
the 50 patients with TBil, only 2 cases had elevated TBil
(one patient in every group, and both below 2 × ULN).
CHE analysis did not show statistically significant differ￾ence between the two groups (p = 0.137). A total of 22
(30.0%) patients had elevated ALT or AST or TBil, in￾cluding 14 (17.7%) mild cases and 8(30.8%) severe cases
(P = 0.156). The median ALB was 42.0 g/L in mild cases
vs. 37.2 g/L in severe cases (P = 0.012).
Analysis of liver function during hospitalization
We compared the differences of the overall distribution
and the abnormal rates of liver function indexes at dif￾ferent cut-off values as 1, 2, or 3 × ULN, respectively, be￾tween the two groups (see Table 2 and Fig. 2). One
critically ill patient died within the study period. A total
of 508 ALT measurements, 383 AST measurements, and
383 TBil measurements during hospitalization were
available for analysis. The highest was 357.0 U/L for
ALT, 156.3 U/L for AST, and 102.9 μmol/L for TBil. It
was showed that the overall distribution of ALT, AST,
and TBil were all significantly difference between mild
and severe group (P < 0.05).
In the single index analysis, the percentage of the pa￾tients having only one abnormal index was 56.2% in the
entire cohort, 51.9% in mild cases vs. 69.2% in severe
cases (P = 0.122). Nineteen (18.1%) patients had elevated
ALT, AST or TBil levels ≥2 × ULN: 10 in severe cases
and 9 in mild cases (P = 0.004).
In the combined analysis, ALT or AST associated with
TBil and elevation of all 3 indices were more common
in severe cases (P < 0.001 or P = 0.001). The proportion
of elevated TBil with elevated AST was 9.3%, and TBil
with ALT was 8.6% (P = 1.000). A total of 8 patients had
elevation in all 3 indices: seven in severe cases vs. only
one in mild cases. One patient (in the severe group) had
elevation of all 3 indices ≥2 × ULN. The percentage of

the patients with elevated both ALT and AST was 12.6%
(10/79) in mild cases vs. 46.2% (12/26) in severe cases
(P = 0.001). Nine patients (8.6%) had ≥3 × ULN elevation
of ALT, AST or TBil.
Categories analysis
Cases were divided into 4 categories based on ALT at
admission and during hospitalization: Normal during the
entire period, normal and then abnormal, abnormal and
then normal, and abnormal during the entire period.
The results are shown in Table 3. Overall, liver functions
returned to normal range in 77 (73.3%) patients before
discharge.
A total of 68 patients (64.8%, 68/105) had normal ALT
during the entire period: 12 (46.2%, 12/26) in severe
cases and 56 (70.9%, 56/79) in mild cases (P = 0.032).
Twenty (19.0%, 20/105) patients had normal ALT at
admission but had elevated ALT during hospitalization:
9 (34.6%, 9/26) in severe cases and 11 (13.9%, 11/79) in
mild cases (P = 0.007). Upon discharge from the hospital,
ALT was still elevated in 10 mild cases (3 at > 2 × ULN)
and in 2 severe cases (1 at > 2 × ULN, and 1 was died).
Most of ALT elevation occurred between day 4 and day
17 of hospitalization, with a mean of 7.3 ± 3.0 d in severe
cases vs. 10.7 ± 4.1 d in mild cases (P = 0.048). Excluding
1 patient with delayed detection for personal reasons,
ALT assessment was conducted every 3.0 ± 0.9 d be￾tween admission and the onset of ALT elevations in
mild cases vs. 2.1 ± 0.6 d in severe cases (P = 0.015).
ALT was elevated at admission but normalized during
hospitalization in 9 (8.6%, 9/105) patients; 7 patients
(8.9%, 7/79) in mild cases and 2 patients (7.7%, 2/26) in
severe cases (P = 1.000). ALT was elevated at admission
and remained elevated during hospitalization in 8 (7.6%,
8/105) patients: 5 (6.3%, 5/79) in mild cases and 3
(11.5%, 3/26) in severe cases (P = 0.406). ALT in the last
test remained elevated in 5 patients.
Dynamic ALT change in a representative case with mild
illness
A 45-year-old man has ALT > 7 × ULN (357.0 U/L) upon
admission. He presented with cough, fever, and chills on
January 24, 2020 and was admitted to the hospital on
January 28, 2020 with a diagnosis of COVID-19. He de￾nied heavy alcohol use and chronic liver disease. Abdom￾inal ultrasound showed no fatty liver, and HBsAg and
anti-HCV were negative. Treatments included antipyretic,
nutritional support, recombinant human interferon α-2b,
lopinavir ritonavir tablet, reduced glutathione and com￾pound glycyrrhizin. During the treatment, ALT gradually
returned to normal (Fig. 3). After 2 consecutive negative
test for SARS-CoV-2 (on February 10, 2020 and February
12, 2020), he was discharged.
Discussion
Consistent with the previous reports [2], patients with
severe illness in the current study had older age, longer
duration from disease onset to hospital admission, and
higher rate of men was larger. Fatty liver was detected in
40.0% (26/65) of mild cases and 45.8% (11/24) of severe
cases. Such a rate is comparable to that in the general
population [7], suggesting that fatty liver is not a pos￾sible predisposing factor for liver injury in COVID-19
patients.
Liver biochemistry abnormality in COVID-19 patients
could be attributed to a variety of factors, including dir￾ect hepatocyte injury by the virus [8], drug-induced liver
injury [1, 9], hypoxic-ischemic microcirculation disorder,
and underlying liver diseases. Temporal relationship is
an important clue in the identification of direct injury
vs. drug-induced liver injury, whereas hepatic injury as￾sociated with hypoxic-ischemic microcirculation dis￾order may be more common in critically ill patients. In
the current study, 21.6% of the abnormal test occurred
after hospital admission. AST is widely distributed in
muscle, cardiac myocytes and mitochondria. As a result,
AST alone is a poor indicator of liver injury. The per￾centage of patients with elevated ALT or TBil was <
20.0% at admission, but in severe cases the rate of ele￾vated AST was 63.6%. During hospitalization, the per￾centage of the patients with elevated ALT, AST as well
as TBil in severe cases was 26.9%, which was signifi￾cantly higher than 1.3% that in mild cases. Consistent

groups were analyzed. Most of the elevated liver function index were less than 3 × ULN. The abnormality of 2 or more indexes is low in the
patients with COVID-19, but it is more likely to occur in the severe group

with exudative lesions in the lungs, poor nutritional in￾take after onset in COVID-19 patients, albumin reduc￾tion was more pronounced in severe cases than in mild
cases. Whether liver injury contributed to albumin
change remains unknown.
Further analysis showed that 56.2% of the patients had
elevated ALT, AST, or TBil levels during the course of
COVID-19, which was higher than the rate at admission.
The percentage of elevated TBil during hospitalization
was 20.8% in mild cases and 36.0% in severe cases; both
were higher than previously reported (9.8 and 20.8%)
[1], and we speculate that the reason for this
phenomenon might be related to the higher proportion
of severe group patients in this study. One patient had
ALT as high as 7590 U/L in previous report without
clear course [2], but the highest ALT in this study was
only 357.0 U/L. The percentage of the patients with ele￾vated ALT, AST as well as TBil was 7.6% in the current
study. Only 1 patient who was critically ill had all 3 indi￾ces at ≥2 × ULN. These findings suggest that liver dam￾age is common but generally mild in COVID-19
patients.
A pattern analysis of ALT change during the study
period showed that majority (68 out of 105) of the pa￾tients had normal ALT during the entire course of dis￾ease. Eight patients had elevated ALT throughout the
study period. Considering the mechanism of COVID-19
liver injury, we speculate that these patients might need
additional relevant testing to identify underlying causes
for liver biochemistry abnormality. Most of patients had
ALT elevations between days 4 and 17 of hospitalization,
with a mean of 7.3 d in severe cases and 10.7 d in mild
cases. Since there was difference in testing frequency be￾tween the two groups, the difference (7.3 d vs. 10.7 d)
could be partly reasonably attributed to a difference in
disease severity. This finding is consistent with the no￾tion that COVID-19 tend be mild in early stages, but
worsens typically in one week [1]. ALT abnormalities in
these patients require further exploration, such as drug￾induced liver injury [9] or associated with changes of
disease status.
This study had some limitations. First, it is a retro￾spective analysis of the data collected from a single cen￾ter. Second, it has been postulated that novel
coronaviruses can enter bile duct epithelial cells
through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) re￾ceptors to cause liver injury [10], but alkaline phosphat￾ase (ALP) and γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT) have not been
found to be elevated [11]. We did not assess ALP and
GGT in the current study. Medication history in many pa￾tients was unknown. Last but not least, the impact of co￾morbidities (i.e., hypertension, coronary heart disease, type
2 diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism and chronic obstruct￾ive pulmonary disease) was not investigated.
Conclusions
A significant proportion of patients with COVID-19
maintained normal liver function throughout the course
of their disease, but patients with severe illness were
more likely to have abnormal liver function. Some pa￾tients started to have abnormal liver function parameters
during treatment after admission, but most patients had
mild and isolated elevations in ALT, AST, or TBil. Most
of the patients discharged with normal liver function,
and further identification of the aetiology is required for
those who did not recover.

Fig. 3 Dynamics of liver function indexes in 1 mild type patient with ALT elevation. A 45-year-old man has ALT > 7 × ULN (357.0 U/L) upon
admission. He was admitted to the hospital on January 28, 2020 with a diagnosis of COVID-19. During the treatment, ALT gradually returned to
normal. After 2 consecutive negative test for SARS-CoV-2 (on February 10, 2020 and February 12, 2020), he was discharged
