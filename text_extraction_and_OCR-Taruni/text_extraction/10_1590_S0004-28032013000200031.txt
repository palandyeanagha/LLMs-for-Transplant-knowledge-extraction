INTRODUCTION
The hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) is an al￾teration in the vasculature of the lung secondary to a 
chronic liver disease, usually cirrhosis, characterized 
by the triad of liver disease, abnormalities in gas 
exchange (increase of alveolar-arterial gradient of 
oxygen, with or without hypoxemia) and evidence of 
intrapulmonary vasodilations (IVD)(12, 21, 29, 34).
Liver cirrhosis causes a series of systemic mani￾festations, including changes in the pulmonary 
vasculature as idiopathic pulmonary hypertension, 
anastomoses between the portal circulation and pul￾monary and the HPS.
The moderate dyspnea is a common finding in 
patients with liver cirrhosis, may result from com￾pression of lung parenchyma by ascites and/or stroke 
pleural(1), concomitant pathologies that affect the 
lungs and liver. However, severe hypoxemia (PaO2 
<60 mmHg) is less common and, in the absence of 
associated cardiopulmonary disease, strongly suggests 
the presence of HPS(5, 8).

ABSTRACT – Context – Hepatopathies can significantly influence both veins and arteries, these changes may cause some cutaneous 
stigmas, such as spider angioma (SA) and some systemic vascular changes, such as those observed in hepatopulmonary syndrome 
(HPS). Based on this common pathophysiological root we can assume that the SA can be skin markers of HPS. Objective – The 
objective of this study is to assess whether there is a relationship between the presence of SA and HPS. Methods – Records of 40 
patients with liver cirrhosis who underwent contrast echocardiography were evaluated, in which we researched the description of SA, 
physical examination, and other clinical and laboratory data. For diagnosis of HPS we use these signs of the disease: presence of 
liver disease (cirrhosis in the case), abnormalities in gas exchange by arterial blood gases, and evidence of pulmonary vasodilations 
by the contrast echocardiography. Results – The SA were found in 21/40 (52.5%) patients and hepatopulmonary syndrome in 9/40 
(22.5%). The HPS was observed in 8/21 (38.1%) of patients with SA and 1/19 (5.3%) patients were without this sign (P<0.01). We 
found no statistically significant difference between the SA and the presence of HPS with sex or age. Patients with SA had a higher 
hypoxemia [PaO2 84.8 ± 11.5 mmHg and 19.8 ± 14.7 mmHg alveolar-arterial gradient of oxygen (AAG)] than those without SA 
(PaO2 90.8 ± 10.7 mmHg and 10.9 ± 11.7 AAG mmHg) (P<0.05). Conclusion - Our findings show a correlation between the presence 
of SA and HPS, suggesting that the SA may be cutaneous markers of HPS.

lar-arterial gradient of oxygen (AAG)  15 mmHg] is 
multifactorial, being caused either by intrapulmonary 
vascular dilations, and by changes in alveolar-capillary 
diffusion of oxygen and/or the imbalance in the venti￾lation/alveolar perfusion(12, 14, 16, 23, 29).
Still little is known about the pathogenesis of in￾trapulmonary vascular dilation, it is believed that it 
is due to a number of factors such as the imbalance 
between vasoconstrictors and vasodilators substances, 
and/or increased sensitivity of pulmonary endothe￾lium to a vasodilator and/or hyporesponsiveness to 
vasoconstrictors substances(12, 14, 16, 23, 29).
This imbalance between vasodilator and vasocon￾strictor substances, is also involved in the pathophys￾iology of others vascular abnormalities observed in 
cirrhosis, such as the clubbing, palmar erythema and 
SA(21, 22).
The SA are lesions that appear as red spots, shiny, 
with numerous microvascular radiations wich pales 
when pressure on a central spot is temporarily ap￾plied(2, 5, 15, 23, 32, 36). They may be present in physiological 
situations, as in pregnancy, on children, on women in 
use of oral contraceptives, but are commonly asso-

ciated with chronic liver diseases, its prevalence is variable, 
ranging from 4 to 47% depending on diagnostic criteria and 
methods used(23).
Assuming that both the HPS and the SA have a common 
pathophysiological root, that is an imbalance between vaso￾constrictor and vasodilator substances, and the suggestion of 
some authors, that SA are most commonly seen in patients 
with the HPS, we can assume that SA could be used as 
skin markers of HPS. This would allow an earlier and less 
costly diagnosis of the syndrome, and thus a more effective 
therapeutic approach. This study aims to evaluate if exists 
a relationship between SA and HPS.
METHODS
We prospectively evaluated 45 patients with liver cirrhosis 
diagnosis seen at the Gastroenterology and Hepatology Service 
of the General Hospital of Goiânia. The diagnosis of cirrhosis 
was based on clinical and laboratory criteria (history, physical 
examination, ultrasound findings and biochemical data and/
or CT scan of the abdomen) and/or histology.
The study included patients of both sexes suffering from 
chronic liver disease, aged above 18 years old and who vol￾untarily agreed to participate. These patients underwent a 
clinical interview and physical examination, focusing on the 
presence of SA. Blood samples were collected to perform 
liver function tests, complete blood count. Arterial blood 
gases were taken with patients sitting and breathing room 
air. The AAG was calculated using the alveolar gas equation. 
Subsequently, a simple echocardiography and a contrast 
echocardiography (CEE) have been made.
The presence of SA was based on physical examination 
data. We consider as carriers of HPS patients who met the 
following criteria: presence of chronic liver disease, abnor￾malities in arterial oxygenation (AAG  15 mmHg) and 
evidence of intrapulmonary vasodilations (IVD) the CEE(29).
For the research of IVD we used CEE performed by an 
experienced researcher using the method of microbubbles. 
The technique is based on the rapid infusion of 10 mL saline 
solution (NaCl 0.9%) in the right median cubital vein(33), after 
its agitation and production of microbubbles. These should 
be viewed in the right heart chambers, with the help of a 
transducer positioned in the left parasternal region, since they 
are echogenic. Under normal conditions, the microbubbles 
are retained in the pulmonary capillary bed, as in patients 
with IVD they are displayed in the left atrium in 3 to 6 car￾diac cycles after being observed in the right chambers(33). Its 
appearance before the third cycle suggests the presence of 
intracardiac communication(33).
Our study was approved by the Ethics Committee of 
human and animal research of General Hospital of Goiânia.
Statistical calculations were performed using the program 
Epi Info 3.5.2 (Centers for Disease Control Epidemiology 
Program Office, Atlanta, Georgia). To evaluate the associ￾ation between qualitative categorical variables it was used 
the chi-square test of Pearson, with the Yates test correction 
when necessary. We used the Kruskal-Wallis test to test the 
correlation of quantitative independent variables. The results 
were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and sig￾nificance level in all tests was set at 5%.
RESULTS
Of the 45 patients initially evaluated five were excluded 
(2 because they had atrio-ventricular communication, 2 for 
not having adequate acoustic window to perform the CEE 
and one for not having finished the protocol). The 40 (88.9%) 
remaining patients composed our study group. Of these, 23 
(57.5%) were men and 17 (42.5%) women. Our population 
was composed mostly by whites (65% - 26 patients) and the 
average age was 48.6 ± 11.7 years old (ranging from 19 to 
71 years old).
Patients were divided into two groups according to the 
presence or absence of SA. Group A: composed of 21 patients 
(52.5%) with SA, the average age was 48.9 ± 10.1 years old, 
13/21 (56.5%) were male. Group B: composed of 19 patients 
(47.5%) without SA, the average age was 48.3 ± 13.6 years old 
and 10/19 (43.5%) were male. There was no statistically signi￾ficant difference between these variables. Table 1 summarizes 
the demographics data of the researched population.

The IVD were present in 19/40 (47.5%), and in 9/40 
(22.5%) also met the other criteria for HPS.
When comparing the two groups we observed that the 
IVD were present in 15/21 (71.4%) patients of group A and 
in 4/19 (21.1%) patients of group B (P<0.005), with relative 
risk 3.4 (1.3 to 8.4). About the HPS, it was present in 8/21 
(38.1%) and in 1/19 (5.3%) respectively (P<0.05), with a 
relative risk of 5.2 (0,8 to 33.9). The mean PaO2 and AAG 
were respectively 84.8 ± 11.5 mmHg and 19.8 ± 14.7 mmHg 
in group A and 90.8 ± 10.7 mmHg and 10.9 ± 11.7 in group 
B (P<0.05).
Most patients 36/40 (90%) had A Child-Pugh index, 
which does not allow to evaluate relations of SA with the 
severity of liver disease.
The hepatitis C virus isolated or associated with alco￾hol consumption were the most common etiologic agents 
of cirrhosis, present in 23/40 (57.5%) and 18/40 (45.0%) 
respectively. There was no statistically significant difference 
between the presence of SA and the etiology of cirrhosis 
(P = 0.68) (Table 2).

DISCUSSION
Galen’s view that the liver controls blood in the veins 
lost prestige as the true nature of the vascular system was 
becoming evident(17). However, information obtained from 
the study of patients with liver disease have revealed that 
these diseases can significantly influence both the arteries 
and veins(11, 17, 30).
In chronic liver disease we can observe the influence of 
portal hypertension in the vascular system. There is dilation 
of the veins of the thorax and abdomen(17) and formation 
of collateral circulation between portal and systemic cir￾culation(10, 20, 35), because of the opening and dilation and 
hypertrophy of preexisting vascular channels(6, 30).
Ectopic varicose veins may occur in the digestive tub(6). 
We can observe the presence on skin of SA, most commonly 
on the face and upper chest, the palms of the hands may 
become hyperemic (palmar erythema) and we can find cya￾nosis, edema in the nail bed and it subsequently can rise to 
the digital clubbing(4, 17).
The SA are known to be a cutaneous stigma of chronic 
liver disease(18, 26), occurring in approximately 15% of patients 
with Laennec’s cirrhosis(26). In patients with this sign, esopha￾geal varicose veins and collateral circulation in the abdomen 
appear to be two times more frequent(7, 14).
In the pulmonary vasculature we can also observe changes 
resulting from chronic liver disease. Idiopathic pulmonary 
hypertension can arise, anastomoses between the portal and 
the pulmonary circulation and HPS(19, 31).
The pathogenesis of intrapulmonary vascular dilatation 
is still debated, several mechanisms have been proposed, 
including: imbalance between vasoconstrictors and vasodi￾lators substances; the increase of pulmonary endothelium 
sensitivity to a vasodilator not produced or not metabolized 
by the diseased liver, or even hyporesponsiveness to vasocon￾strictor substances(12, 14, 16, 23, 31).
Among the vasodilator substances postulated to explain 
the pathogenesis of HPS, the nitric oxide (NO) wins a role. 
The NO is a potent endothelial vasodilator and could be 
responsible for intrapulmonary vasodilatation, since in 
cirrhotic patients the serum levels of this substance are ele￾vated, possibly due to endotoxemy observed in this group 
of patients, which would induce an increased production of 
NO (9, 12, 14, 15, 23).
Therefore, both the HPS and the SA seem to have a com￾mon pathophysiological root, which is the imbalance between 
vasoconstrictors and vasodilators substances.
Some authors have suggested that the SA is most com￾monly seen in patients with the HPS(1, 3, 18, 27, 28), although 
other authors have not found the same relationship(13, 24). In 
the classic story of Rydell and Hoffbauer(18) the authors have 
called attention to the fact that the vast majority of cirrhotic 
patients with cyanosis and digital clubbing associated exhibit 
one or more vascular stigmas of cirrhosis, especially SA(18). 
Andrivet et al.(3) found the signal in seven of nine cirrhotic 
patients with hypoxemia. Rodriguez-Roisin et al.(28) demon￾strated that patients with SA have higher gas exchange ab￾normalities, reduced pulmonary vasoconstrictor response to 
hypoxia, reduced pulmonary vascular resistance and systemic 
and major changes in the relation ventilation/perfusion than 
patients without the sign(28). In contrast, Lima et al.(24) eval￾uating the clinical features of cirrhotic patients candidates 
for liver transplantation, observed the SA in 8/9 (88.8%) of 
patients with HPS and in 35/47 (74.5%) of cirrhotics without 
the syndrome (P = 0.6). Fallon et al.(13) also evaluating can￾didates for liver transplantation, also found no difference in 
the prevalence of SA in patients with or without HPS (37% 
and 39% respectively, P = 0.78). In our study, the SA were 
found in 8/9 (88.9%) patients with HPS, in 7/10 (70.0%) of 
patients with IVD without hypoxemia and in 6/21 (28.6%) 
of patients without IVD (P<0.005). Suggesting that the SA 
could not only be related to HPS but as well as to the degree 
of IVD, and may also be a predictive marker of HPS.
The HPS is a respiratory manifestation of liver disease 
characterized by the triad: liver disease, hypoxemia, and 
IVD. In the present study, we found the IVD in 15 (71.4%) 
of 21 patients with SA and in 4/19 (21.1%) of those without

such abnormalities (P<0.01). Mohammad Alizadeh AH 
et al.(25) found the presence of IVD in 17/54 (31.4%) of re￾searched patients, of these, 10/54 (18.3%) met criteria for the 
HPS and 7/54 (13%) had only IVD, defined as subclinical 
cases of the syndrome. In this study, HPS was found in 9/40 
(22.5%) patients. Despite that, 10/40 (25.0%) patients had 
IVD, however, without fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of 
the syndrome, which may represent a frustrated form of it, 
as the subclinical cases found in the study of Mohammad 
Alizadeh AH et al.(25).
The average of PaO2 was lower in patients with SA (84.8 
± 11.5 mm Hg) compared with patients without the sign (90.8 
± 10.7 mm Hg) with P<0.05; and the average AAG in the first 
group was higher (19.8 ± 14.7), compared with 10.9 ± 11.7 
in the second (P<0.05). These findings suggest that patients 
with SA are more hypoxemic than patients without SA.
Based on our findings we suggest that the SA are skin 
markers of the presence of HPS. However, it is necessary 
to perform further studies to correlate the presence of HPS 
with the number and size of the SA.

RESUMO – Contexto - As hepatopatias podem influenciar de forma considerável tanto as veias quanto as artérias, dessas alterações podem surgir alguns 
estigmas cutâneos, como as aranhas vasculares (AV) e algumas alterações vasculares sistêmicas, como as observadas na Síndrome Hepatopulmonar 
(SHP). Baseados nessa possível raiz fisiopatogênica comum, podemos supor que as AV sejam marcadores cutâneos da SHP. Objetivo - Avaliar se há 
relação entre a presença das AV e a SHP. Métodos - Foram avaliados os prontuários de 40 pacientes com cirrose hepática submetidos a ecocardiografia 
com contraste (ECC), nos quais pesquisamos a descrição de AV, no exame físico, e outros dados clínicos e laboratoriais. Para diagnóstico da SHP 
utilizamos os seguintes critério: presença de hepatopatia (no caso cirrose), de anormalidades nas trocas gasosas pela gasometria arterial, e evidências 
de vasodilatações pulmonares pela ecocardiografia com contraste. Resultados - As AV foram encontradas em 21/40 (52,5%) pacientes e a síndrome 
hepatopulmonar em 9/40 (22,5%). A SHP foi observada em 8/21 (38,1%) dos pacientes com AV e em 1/19 (5,3%) dos pacientes sem esse sinal (P<0,01). 
Não encontramos diferença estatisticamente significativa entre a presença das AV e da SHP com sexo ou faixa etária. Pacientes com AV apresentaram 
maior hipoxemia (PaO2 84,8 ± 11,5 mmHg e GAA 19,8 ± 14,7 mmHg) que os sem AV (PaO2 90,8 ± 10,7 mmHg e GAA 10,9 ± 11,7 mmHg) (P<0,05). 
Conclusão - Nossos achados mostram correlação entre a presença das AV e a SHP, sugerindo que as AV possam ser marcadores cutâneos da SHP.
