Abstract
Background: Late-onset noninfectious pulmonary complications (LONIPCs), which occur more than 3 months
after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), are major causes of morbidity and mortality after
transplantation. Among LONIPCs, we occasionally treat patients with late-onset severe restrictive lung defect after
HSCT; however, its clinical features have not been fully elucidated.
Methods: A retrospective chart review of a single center on cases of late-onset severe restrictive lung defect after
HSCT was performed. Among 453 patients who survived longer than 100 days after allogeneic HSCT with evaluable
spirometry data, 12 patients (2.6%) developed late-onset severe restrictive lung defect (i.e., vital capacity percent of
predicted less than 60%).
Results: Median duration from transplantation to diagnosis of late-onset severe restrictive lung defect cases was 44.
5 months. Major computed tomography (CT) finding was pleuroparenchymal thickening with volume loss, an evidence
of fibrosis, predominantly in upper lobes (n = 7), which was consistent with pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis. The
remaining patients showed unclassifiable interstitial pneumonia pattern (n = 2) and airway-predominant pattern (n = 3).
The diffusing capacity for carbon oxide tended to decrease, while the residual volume/total lung capacity ratio tended
to increase after HSCT. Of 12 patients, 8 patients died and the median month from diagnosis to death was 33.5 months.
Seven patients died of pulmonary or systemic infection, and one patient died due to relapse of the primary disease.
Conclusion: Severe restrictive lung defect could develop in selected cases in the late-phase after HSCT and could be a
unique clinical entity with specific radiographical findings.

Background
Despite recent progress in allogeneic hematopoietic stem
cell transplantation (HSCT) for hematological diseases,
pulmonary complications have been recognized as one of
the major causes of morbidity and mortality after allogen￾eic HSCT, occurring in about 40–70% of patients, with a
high mortality rate [1–3]. Pulmonary complications after
HSCT are caused by various noninfectious and infectious
causes, and develop in both the early and late phases after
transplantation, contingent on the day of development
before or after 100 days following HSCT.
Opportunistic infection caused by bacteria, fungus,
and viruses represents a major cause of infectious
pulmonary complications in the early phase after HSCT
[2, 4]. In contrast, noninfectious pulmonary complica￾tions are major causes of morbidity and mortality later
than 100 days after allogeneic HSCT, which have been la￾belled late-onset noninfectious pulmonary complications

(LONIPCs) [5]. LONIPCs classically include bronchiolitis
obliterans (BO), cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP)
(previously called bronchiolitis obliterans organizing
pneumonia [BOOP]), diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH),
and idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS) [6, 7].
IPS is a severe pulmonary complication occurring after
HSCT, which was originally characterized by symptoms
and signs of pneumonia, restrictive pulmonary function
test abnormality, and alveolar injury without documented
lower respiratory tract infection [8]. The American
Thoracic Society (ATS) Research Statement on IPS pro￾vides a comprehensive review of IPS, the definition of
which has been updated [9]. IPS is clinically defined by
three criteria: widespread alveolar injury, absence of docu￾mented infection, and absence of cardiac, renal, or iatro￾genic etiology. The evidence of widespread alveolar injury
is based on multilobar infiltrates on chest radiographs or
computed tomography (CT), symptoms and signs of
pneumonia, and evidence of abnormal pulmonary physi￾ology, including restrictive pulmonary function test abnor￾mality. The time of onset for IPS ranges from 4 to
106 days and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) occurs
in early post-HSCT, with an indicated median onset time
of 12–15 days [9]. Therefore, it seems that LONIPCs gen￾erally do not include IPS, according to the ATS statement.
Pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis (PPFE), originally re￾ported as an idiopathic disease [10], has previously been
reported as a novel radiological and pathological feature
in patients with pulmonary disease in the late phase after
HSCT [11]. However, detailed clinical and radiological
features of pulmonary complications after HSCT, espe￾cially in the late phase, are still largely unknown.
The primary aim of this retrospective study was to
clarify the clinical and radiological features of late-onset
severe restrictive lung defect after HSCT.
Methods
Patients
The retrospective study protocol was approved by the
Institutional Review Board of Keio University School of
Medicine (Tokyo, Japan).
We reviewed, in the institutional database, the medical
records of 530 consecutive patients who underwent allo￾geneic HSCT at Keio University Hospital (Tokyo, Japan)
between January 1990 and December 2011. The patient
enrolment flowchart is shown in Fig. 1. Twelve (2.6%) of
453 patients were enrolled in the analysis as patients
with late-onset severe restrictive lung defect according
to % vital capacity (VC, <60%). There were 89 patients
with a restrictive defect at %VC < 80%. Among the 89
patients, there were 86 patients with a restrictive defect
at %VC 70–80%; their radiological findings were rela￾tively mild and not specific. In addition, there were 3 pa￾tients with a restrictive defect at %VC 60–70%; the three
patients showed very mild or no respiratory symptoms.
Therefore, only patients with a severe restrictive defect
at %VC < 60% were finally enrolled, because we aimed
to exclude heterogeneous cases of mild to moderate re￾strictive ventilatory defect.
Radiological evaluation
Chest radiographs and chest CT images were evaluated
independently by two pulmonologists and one radiolo￾gist. The conclusions were reached by consensus.
The radiological features were mainly categorized into 3
patterns: PPFE, unclassifiable interstitial pneumonia (IP),
and airway-predominant (centrilobular nodules with BO),
based on the consensus of the two pulmonologists and
one radiologist.
Pulmonary function tests
Pulmonary function tests were performed according to
established methods [12, 13].
Diagnosis of acute and chronic graft-versus-host-disease
Acute and chronic graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD)
was diagnosed and graded according to established
consensus criteria [14, 15].

Statistical analysis
Differences were analyzed for statistical significance
using a paired t-test. P-values less than 0.05, two-tailed,
were considered statistically significant.
Results
Clinical features of patients with late-onset severe
restrictive lung defect
The clinical features of the patients with late-onset severe
restrictive lung defect are summarized in Table 1. The
median age at stem cell transplantation was 41 years. Ten
patients underwent HSCT from an unrelated donor.
Conditioning regimens were total body irradiation (TBI)
(12 Gy)-based myeloablative regimens (n = 10), busulphan￾based myeloablative regimen (n = 1), and fludarabine￾based regimen in combination with melphalan (n = 1).
For GVHD prophylaxis, all patients received cyclo￾sporine A or tacrolimus in combination with short-term
methotrexate (Table 1). Eleven of 12 patients developed
acute GVHD (grade I [n = 4], grade II [n = 4], and grade
III [n = 3]). All 12 patients had chronic GVHD and de￾veloped the extensive-type (Table 1).
Eight of 12 patients died at a median of 33.5 months
after the diagnosis of late onset severe restrictive lung
defect (Tables 1 and 2). Seven of 8 patients (87.5%) died
of pulmonary or systemic infection (bacterial (n = 4);
fungal (n = 2), and both (n = 1)). One died of relapse of
multiple myeloma.
Characteristics of patients with late-onset severe
restrictive lung defect
The median time from transplantation to diagnosis was
44.5 months (Table 2). HRCT demonstrated pleuropar￾enchymal thickening with volume loss, associated with
evidence of fibrosis, in the upper lobe (PPFE pattern) in
7 (58.3%) patients, bronchiectasis in 5 (41.7%) patients,
BO in 5 (41.7%) patients, pneumothorax in 6 (50%)
patients (Table 2). Among 5 non-PPFE pattern cases,
unclassifiable IP pattern was observed in 2 patients
(cases No. 6 and No. 7) and centrilobular nodules
with BO, associated with the features of airway￾predominant diseases (airway predominant pattern),
were observed in 3 patients (cases No. 8, No. 9, and
No. 10). All 5 patients complicated with BO showed
air trapping on expiratory HRCT.
Representative chest radiographs and HRCT images of
PPFE pattern are shown in Fig. 2a, b, and c. Bronchiectasis
was observed in the left lower lobe in case No. 2 (Fig. 2a).
Representative CT findings of unclassifiable IP pattern
in case No. 6 (Fig. 3a, b) and airway-predominant
pattern (i.e., diffuse bilateral bronchial wall thickening
and centrilobular nodules) in case No. 8 (Fig. 3c, d)
are also shown.
Pulmonary function changes in patients with late-onset
severe restrictive lung defect
The results of spirometry are shown in Fig. 4a. Data pre￾sented as post-diagnosis are those at diagnosis (cases No.
8 and No. 10) or those most recently examined (other
cases), and data presented as pre-diagnosis were those be￾fore HSCT. The median follow up was 105.8 months. The
median %VC before HSCT was 91% (range, 83–131%).
However, the level of median %VC was dramatically de￾creased (40%, range 18–55%) after diagnosis of late onset
severe restrictive lung defect. The levels of VC, forced vital
capacity (FVC), and forced expiratory volume in one sec￾ond (FEV1) were also decreased after HSCT.
The data of lung volumes and DLco were available in
9 of 12 patients excluding cases No. 7, No. 8, and No.
12. Data presented as pre-diagnosis were those before
HSCT (cases No. 4, No. 6, and No. 9) or those per￾formed earliest after HSCT at a median of 12.6 months
after HSCT (range, 5.0–40.2) but before diagnosis of
late-onset severe restrictive lung defect (other cases).
Data presented as post-diagnosis were those most re￾cently examined (Fig. 4b). The median follow up was
100.3 (range, 30.5–138.0) months. The level of TLC and
DLco was markedly decreased after HSCT, while RV/
TLC ratio increased after HSCT. The data of lung vol￾umes and DLco in each radiological pattern were shown
in the Additional file 1: Figure S1.
Representative data of time course changes of VC
in three patients (cases No. 2, No. 4, and No. 12)
whose CT images are presented in Fig. 2 are shown
(Fig. 4c, d, and e). In case No. 2, the episode of bac￾terial pneumonia resulted in marked decrease in VC,
followed by further decrease in VC after the episode
of pneumothorax (Fig. 4c). In case No. 4, pneumothorax as
well as unknown etiology seemed to contribute to decrease
in VC (Fig. 4d). In case No. 12, the episode of bacterial
pneumonia reduced VC level, and pneumomediastinum
and pneumothorax further decreased VC (Fig. 4e). These
results indicate that the onset of pneumothorax and pul￾monary infection contributed to the progressive decrease
in restrictive pulmonary function and exacerbation of late
onset severe restrictive lung defect, thus contributing to its
poor prognosis.
Discussion
In this retrospective observational study of allogeneic
HSCT recipients, we investigated the clinical features of
patients with late-onset severe restrictive lung defect
(%VC less than 60%) and identified 12 cases with charac￾teristic radiological findings and pulmonary function
changes.
We have shown the incidence of cases of late-onset se￾vere restrictive lung defect (%VC less than 60%) was
2.6% in patients who survived more than 100 days after

allogeneic HSCT and underwent spirometry (12 of 453
cases). The incidence of cases of late-onset severe re￾strictive lung defect developing later than 100 days after
HSCT, which has previously been reported as IPS, was
3.5% in adult patients [6]. Another report showed the in￾cidence of cases of late-onset severe restrictive lung de￾fect, which has previously been reported as IPS, as 3.1%
in pediatric patients with 1.6% severe restrictive ventila￾tory defect of %VC less than 60% [16]. The incidence of
cases of late-onset severe restrictive lung defect observed
in the present study is comparable to those of previous
studies. A distinctive characteristic of our retrospective
cohort study is that we observed, not only more than
500 consecutive HSCT cases, but also pulmonary func￾tion test data on more than 95% of these cases were
available. Although this was a retrospective study in a
single center, we believe that the HSCT incidence rate
and other data are highly reliable and representative.
Late-onset severe restrictive lung defect cases in the
present study showed the following characteristic radio￾logical findings: pleuroparenchymal thickening with vol￾ume loss, predominantly in the upper lobe (PPFE
pattern) in 7 of 12 patients. A previous report demon￾strated that PPFE, originally reported as idiopathic [10],
had features of late-onset lung involvement after allo￾geneic HSCT [11]. Although we have not confirmed
PPFE by pathological examination in the present study,
CT findings in 7 of 12 patients were consistent with the
findings seen in patients with PPFE. The other 5 non￾PPFE cases were evaluated, and we found that 3 cases
were airway-predominant pattern, and 2 cases were un￾classifiable IP pattern. Therefore, late-onset severe re￾strictive lung defect cases in the present study could be
categorized into 3 groups based on radiological features:
PPFE pattern IP (n = 7), airway-predominant pattern
with BO (n = 3), and unclassifiable IP pattern (n = 2). In
the present study, half of the patients had a history of
pneumothorax, and 5 patients showed BO. Only one of
the 5 patients with BO developed pneumothorax. Con￾versely, PPFE could have contributed to the onset of
pneumothorax as subpleural fibrosis is attributed to re￾current rupturing of bullae [11]. Indeed, among 6 cases
with a history of pneumothorax, 4 patients showed typ￾ical PPFE pattern on HRCT. The 2 other cases were
both unclassifiable IP, suggesting that pulmonary fibrosis
may be a risk factor for pneumothorax in patients with
late-onset severe restrictive lung defect.
With regard to clinical features, we believe there are
mainly two clinical courses leading to late-onset severe
restrictive lung defect: those associated with and those
not associated with BO. Late-onset severe restrictive
lung defect associated with BO would display mixed
ventilatory impairment after exacerbation of obstructive
ventilatory impairment due to BO. In contrast, late￾onset severe restrictive lung defect not associated with
BO directly displays severe restrictive ventilatory impair￾ment induced by subpleural fibrosis and rupture involv￾ing pneumothorax.
The present study demonstrated that VC tended to de￾crease after pneumothorax and pulmonary infection.
There were two exceptional cases (cases No. 8 and No.
10) of airway-predominant diseases, of which %VC was
mildly increased after the diagnosis of late-onset severe
restrictive lung defect. This may be associated with cases
that are not progressive PPFE pattern IP but airway￾predominant diseases with BO. TLC and DLco were
decreased, while RV/TLC ratio was increased in the
present study. A previous report demonstrated that

idiopathic PPFE showed increased RV/TLC ratio [17].
This might be due to compensated hyperinflation in the
lower lobes, which is not observed in typical idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis. Therefore, increased RV/TLC ratio,
in the present study, might also be due to compensated
hyperinflation in the lower lobes as well as decreased
TLC, especially in patients with PPFE pattern.
It has been reported that extensive chronic GVHD
was a risk factor for LONIPCs, which possibly included
cases of late-onset severe restrictive lung defect [5].
Consistent with these previous studies, all patients of
late-onset severe restrictive lung defect, in the present
study, had developed chronic GVHD. These results sug￾gest that chronic GVHD could be a risk factor for late￾onset severe restrictive lung defect cases.
The outcomes of patients with late-onset severe re￾strictive lung defect in the present study were unfavor￾able [9]; only 4 of 12 patients were alive at the time of
the analysis with a median month from diagnosis to
death of 33.5 months. Except for one case of death due
to the relapse of multiple myeloma, all patients suc￾cumbed due to systemic or pulmonary infection, which
is a novel finding in patients with late-onset severe re￾strictive lung defect.

There were limitations in the present study; one is that
we were not able to obtain pathological specimens.
Therefore, we could not pathologically confirm either
PPFE or BO. However, the diagnosis of BO does not
necessarily require biopsy per the 2014 NIH consensus
development project [18]. Consequently, we do not be￾lieve pathological confirmation is essential to diagnose
patients with late-onset severe restrictive lung defect,
considering the patients’ QOL and the difficulty in
performing biopsy. The second is that the range of the
timing of the pulmonary function tests may be too wide
as pulmonary function tests presented as pre-diagnosis
were those before HSCT or those performed after HSCT
at a median of 12.6 months after HSCT (range 5.0–
40.2 months). The third is that VC levels might not be
accurate for identifying the development of late restrict￾ive lung defect, because the patient could have a moder￾ate restrictive lung defect due to early BO. A large,
prospective study may contribute to clarifying the late￾onset severe restrictive lung defect after HSCT.
We should be more aware of the unique entities after
HSCT. Although there are still few reports on these en￾tities, more unrecognized cases are expected to happen
in the real clinical setting. Considering from the perspec￾tive of HSCT, only 2.4% of HSCT patients proceed to
late-onset severe restrictive lung defect, while most of
the cases do not proceed to this condition. We speculate
that more unknown risk factors related to late-onset se￾vere restrictive lung defect exist. In the future, we should
seek more definite risk factors of severe restrictive lung
defects and interventions to prevent late-onset severe
restrictive lung defect in the early stage post-HSCT by
accumulating more cases.
Conclusion
In summary, we have demonstrated the clinical charac￾teristics of late-onset severe restrictive lung defect cases.
The incidence of late-onset severe restrictive lung defect
cases reported in the current study is comparable to that
previously reported. Major CT findings in late-onset se￾vere restrictive lung defect cases were pleuroparenchy￾mal thickening with volume loss predominantly in the
upper lobe, which was consistent with PPFE pattern on
HRCT. The major cause of death was systemic or pul￾monary infection with respiratory failure. The findings
of our study may help to elucidate the unique clinical
and radiological features of late-onset severe restrictive
lung defect after HSCT.
