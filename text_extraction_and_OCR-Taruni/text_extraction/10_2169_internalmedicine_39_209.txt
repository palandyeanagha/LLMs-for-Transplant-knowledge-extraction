Abstract
Objective and MethodsWeretrospectively evaluated 61
cases with pulmonaryaspergilloma representing patients
admitted to Nagasaki University Hospital between Janu￾ary 1991 to June 1998.
Results Fifty-two (85%) were males and 9 (15%) were
females, aged between 14 to 80 years (average, 65 years).
Forty-four (72%) patients had history of old pulmonary
tuberculosis. Chest radiographs showed "fungus ball" in
the cavities in 42 (67%) cases while 16 (26%) cases showed
thickening of the cavity wall. Aspergillusfumigatus was iso￾lated in 24 (39%) patients. Aspergillus antigen or antibody
was positive in 8 (13%) and 43 (70%) patients, respectively.
Oral itraconazole was used in 16 (26%) of patients, and
surgical excision was performed in 15 (25 %) patients. Dur￾ing hospitalization or after discharge, 19 (31 %) patients
died.
Summaryand Conclusion Pulmonary aspergilloma usu￾ally occurs in elderly patients with old tuberculosis and re￾spiratory failure. Manycases did not respond to antifun￾gal therapy with itraconazole or amphotericin B. Our analy￾sis indicates that more effective and appropriate therapeu￾tic regimens are needed for the treatment of patients with
pulmonary aspergilloma. (Internal Medicine 39: 209-212, 2000)

Introduction
Pulmonary aspergillosis results from colonization or infec￾tion of the lung by pathogenic filamentous fungi, Aspergillus
species. Three different clinical categories of pulmonary as￾pergillosis are encountered depending on the condition of the
host. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis occurs in the immuno￾compromisedpatient, particularly granulocytopenic patients
following anticancer chemotherapy for the treatment of hema￾tological malignancy. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillo￾sis (ABPA)results from Arthus reaction to the antigen from
inhaled Aspergillus species. In the third category, spores of
Aspergillus species enter the respiratory tract and invade pul￾monary tuberculous cavities or postoperative lung to form a
mycetomawith a typical appearance of a "fungus ball" on the
chest radiograph.
For editorial comment, see p 191.
Pulmonary aspergilloma is the commonestform of as￾pergillosis in Japan. Most infections are caused by the fungus,
Aspergillusfumigatus, however, many other species including
A. flavus, A. niger, A. nidulans, A. terreus have also been re￾ported as the causative pathogens (1, 2). Most patients are usu￾ally asymptomatic and are therefore detected by coincidence
on chest radiographs during routine health examination. On
the other hand, a proportion of patients with pulmonary
aspergilloma might report hemosputumand hemoptysis (3).
Chest X-ray remains the simplest diagnostic tool for pulmo￾nary aspergilloma. Aspergilloma typically appears as a solid,
rounded mass within a cavity, separated from the wall of the
cavity by air. The thickness of the cavity wall varies from one
case to another (4). Serological tests usually support, but do
not confirm the diagnosis. Surgical excision of the aspergilloma
leads to a diminution in the sensitivity of the precipitin reac￾tion and eventual disappearance of these antibodies (5); per￾sistence of the serum antibody is seen postoperatively when
other sites of antigen stimuli are present.
For effective treatment, surgical removal of aspergilloma is
recommended,but manypatients are unfit for operative sur￾gery due to a poor general condition, age or poor pulmonary
function. Itraconazole, an effective oral triazole antifungal
agent, is used for patients with pulmonary aspergilloma, but
many patients do not respond well in spite of long-term therapy
with this agent.
In the present study, we retrospectively examined the medi￾cal records of 61 cases of pulmonary aspergilloma and evalu￾ated their clinical outcome.

aspergilloma were retrospectively reviewed. These patients
represented all those admitted with pulmonary aspergilloma
whowere admitted to Nagasaki University Hospital during the
period from January 1991 to June 1998. Further, the findings
on the chest X-ray and chest computed tomography (CT) scans
were also reviewed. On the chest CTscan, a "fungus ball" was
defined as the presence of a solid masssurrounded by air or an
irregular mass filling the cavity. Data of culture and sensitivity
of specimens, serological tests, and bronchoscopy were evalu￾ated in each case.
Patients were included if they had (a) a fungus ball on chest
X-ray, (b); a suggestive chest X-ray (fungus ball or thickness
of the wall of cavity or pleura) and positive cultures, (c); a
suggestive chest X-ray and positive serodiagnosis, and (d); (b)
plus pathologic specimens ofAspergillus species. Clinical pre￾sentation, including cough, hemosputum, dyspnea, fever, and
hemoptysis was recorded in each case. Progression of the dis￾ease was defined radiographically (increasing infiltrate related
to Aspergillus infection or increasing size of the aspergilloma
cavity). In total, 61 patients were identified; 10 patients met
the criteria set in item (a), 7 met those in (b), 19 met those in
(c), and 25 met those in (d).
Results
Clinical features
Patients consisted of 52 (85%) males and 9 (15%) females,
aged from 14 to 80 years (average, 65 years). Forty-four (72%)
patients had a history of old pulmonary tuberculosis, while oth￾ers had an underlying disease, including liver disease in 4 (7%)
patients and pulmonary cyst in 2 (3%) patients (Table 1). How￾ever, most patients with aspergilloma were asymptomatic. The
most commonsymptomon admission was cough (12 cases,
20%), followed by hemosputum (ll cases, 18%), and hemop￾tysis (4 cases, 7%), dyspnea (4 cases, 7%), fever (4 cases, 7%),
and general fatigue (1 case, 2%). The findings on physical ex￾amination were generally non-specific, though localized signs,
such as decreased air movement and bronchial breath sounds
were audible in some patients. The laboratory tests showed a
normal total WBCcount and elevated CRP. The results of other
tests are summarizedin Table 2.
Diagnosis and therapy
Chest X-ray showed a solitary aspergilloma in 59 (97%)
cases and only two (3%) patients had bilateral aspergilloma. A
"fungus ball" pattern was present in 42 (67%) cases, while thick￾ening of the walls was noted in 16 (26%) cases. The pulmo￾nary shadows were located in the right upper lobe (32 cases,
53%), left upper lobe (21 cases, 34%), or right middle lobe (6
cases, 10%). In thirty-two (52%) patients, Aspergillus spp. was
isolated from clinical specimens. Aspergillus spp. was isolated
from bronchial aspirates (14 cases), sputum (9 cases),
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (8 cases) (Table 3).
Circulating galactomannanantigen was measuredby the
latex agglutination test (Pastorex Aspergillus, Sanofi Diagnos￾tics Pasteur, France). Galactomannanantigen was measuredin

Amphotericin B was administrated inside the mycetomacav￾ity in 8 (13%) patients, or intravenously in 1 (2%) patient. Other antifungal agents such as miconazole, fluconazole, or
flucytosine were used in 12 patients, and 9 (15%) cases were
treated conservatively without any antifungal therapy. During
hospitalization or after discharge, 19 (3 1%) patients died. The
details of treatment and course of the disease are summarized
in Table 4. The cause of death was related to the severity of the
underlying respiratory disease; 7 patients died of respiratory
failure, 3 patients died of lung cancer, 2 patients developed
fulminant bacterial pneumonia, and 1 patient died following a
massive pulmonary embolism. One patient (Patient 8) died of
invasive pulmonaryaspergillosis with secondary amyloidosis.
Twopatients (Patients 17 and 18) died within a short period
after thoracotomy due to associated postoperative complica- tions.
Discussion
The filamentous Aspergillus species invade the body through
the respiratory tract and colonize in the bronchi and lungs.
Pulmonaryaspergilloma commonlyencountered in clinical
practice is caused by Aspergillus species in the tuberculous
cavities and in postoperative lung. Most cases of aspergilloma
are believed to arise from colonization and proliferation of the
fungus in a preexisting pulmonary cavity. The factors that en￾hance the establishment of the fungus in a particular patient
are not well understood. Tuberculosis is by far the most com￾moncondition associated with aspergillosis (6). This was also
confirmed in the present study; pulmonary tuberculosis was
the most commonpredisposing disease.
The clinical course of pulmonary aspergilloma varies widely
amongpatients. Pulmonaryaspergilloma remains stable over
long periods of time although a slow increase in size or spon￾taneous resolution has been reported. Spontaneous lysis of the
mycetoma has been reported to occur in approximately 7% to
10%of the cases (7). In the present study, there was no case of
spontaneous lysis, but one patient improved following oral
itraconazole. In this case, a fungal ball was not detected on any
chest X-ray or chest CT taken during the period of follow-up.
Generally, no treatment is necessary unless hemoptysis occurs,
but massive hemoptysis necessitates surgery with resection of
the affected lung in suitable candidates or arterial emboliza￾tion in those with the disease. In our study, there were only 4
cases with a history of episodes of hemoptysis, but none had
massive hemoptysis or emergency operation, because bronchial
arteries were embolized in manycases whenaspergilloma was
found on chest X-ray examination.
The major forms of medical therapy include parenteral, in￾tracavitary, and endobronchial administration of antifungal
drugs. AmphotericinB and itraconazole are efficacious against
Aspergillus spp. in vitro (8). However,oral itraconazole or in￾travenous amphotericin B treatment seems to have no benefit,
because of inadequate penetration of the drug into Aspergillus

spp. multiplying in the cavities. Attempts of intracavitary in￾jection of amphotericin B have been reported to deal with this
problem, but only a few patients showed a response to this
form of therapy (9). In the present study, 19 patients with pul￾monary aspergilloma died while in hospital or after discharge.
Themost commoncause of death was not massive hemoptysis
but respiratory failure (37%). After all, the course and progno￾sis of patients with pulmonary aspergilloma cannot be predicted,
rather they depend on the underlying pulmonary disease pro￾cess and general health. Surgical resection is considered the
best therapy, but the morbidity associated with surgery for pul￾monary aspergilloma is considerably higher; approximately
25% of patients develop certain postoperative complications,
such as bronchopleural fistulas, empyema, hemorrhage, and
various forms of infections (10).
In conclusion, pulmonary aspergilloma usually occurs in
elderly patients with old tuberculosis and respiratory failure.
The recommended treatment for pulmonary aspergilloma is
surgical resection, however, in manycases surgery is contrain￾dicated because of debility, old age or reduced pulmonary func￾tion. Manycases do not respond to antifungal therapy with
itraconazole or amphotericin B. Developmentof moreeffec￾tive antifungal agents and appropriate managementis neces￾sary to combat pulmonary aspergilloma in the future.
