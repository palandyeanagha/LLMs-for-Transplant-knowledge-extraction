Summary
The vasopressin type 2 receptor antagonist tolvaptan (TLV) has recently become available to treat congestion in in￾hospital patients with heart failure (HF). However, there is no evidence confi rming the long-term effi cacy of TLV. The 
Assessment of QUAlity of life during long-term treatment of TLV in refractory heart failure (AQUA-TLV) study is a 
multicenter, open-labeled, randomized, controlled clinical trial that will enroll 100 patients from 18 hospitals in Japan. 
Patients with HF assigned to New York Heart Association class III or IV, who had a previous history of hospitalization 
due to congestive HF during the past 1 year and ongoing symptomatic congestion with baseline urine osmolality > 350 
mOsm/L regardless of being prescribed daily furosemide ≥ 60 mg are randomized to the conventional diuretics group (50 
patients) and TLV add-on group (50 patients), and their quality of life will be assessed using the Minnesota Living with 
Heart Failure Questionnaire after 6 months of treatment. This study is the fi rst multicenter prospective randomized study 
in Japan to evaluate the long-term clinical effectiveness of TLV compared with conventional treatment in patients with 
congestive HF (UMIN Clinical Trial Registry Number: UMIN 000009604). (Int Heart J 2014; 55: 264-267)

H eart failure (HF) has become one of the major causes 
of death not only in Europe and the United States but 
also in Japan.1) Repeated rehospitalizations due to 
fl uid overload, which results from water retention by way of 
increased activity of the arginine vasopressin (AVP) system, 
sympathetic nervous system, and renin-angiotensin-aldoster￾one system along with decreased renal function and reduced 
cardiac output, worsen patient quality of life (QOL) enormous￾ly.2-4)
Conventionally, thiazides and loop diuretics have been 
essential tools to control congestion in HF patients.5) However, 
such diuretics have several drawbacks, including worsening of 
hyponatremia, renal dysfunction, and hypotension due to loss 
of intravascular volume with sodium depletion as well as water 
retention resulting from inappropriate AVP secretion against 
low or normal serum osmolality.6-10) These drawbacks cause 
worsening of HF and increases in the dosage of diuretics, both 
of which result in the development of a vicious cycle.
Recently, the vasopressin type 2 receptor antagonist 
tolvaptan (TLV) has become available for HF patients with 
symptomatic congestion with or without hyponatremia. As a 
new aquaretic agent, TLV has been demonstrated by several 
authors, including us, to ameliorate congestion, stabilize he￾modynamics, and improve hyponatremia without sacrificing 
renal function.11-22) However, such evidence has mostly been 
limited to among in-hospital patients over several weeks.20,23)
The EVEREST trial is thus far the only prospective trial that 
analyzed the long-term prognosis of TLV over placebo, but its 
no-better-than placebo result was disappointing.13) Thus, we 
conducted this randomized trial to clarify the long-term effi ca￾cy of TLV in patients refractory to conventional diuretics in 
terms of patient QOL.

(NYHA) III or IV are enrolled in this study. Decompensated 
HF is diagnosed on the basis of Framingham criteria by attend￾ing physicians.24) All patients have one or more previous hospi￾talizations due to worsening of decompensated HF during the 
past 1 year. Eligible patients have either hepatomegaly, lower 
limb edema, pulmonary congestion described as cardiomegaly, 
vascular redistribution, and interstitial and alveolar edema by 
chest X-ray, or jugular venous distension due to fl uid retention 
despite a considerable amount of diuretics (equivalent to oral 
or intravenous administration of furosemide ≥ 60 mg/day) in 
addition to appropriate restriction of sodium and water in￾take.25) There is no restriction of left ventricular ejection frac￾tion.
Patients are excluded if they had hypovolemia, severe 
stenotic valvular disease, severe systemic infection or infl am￾mation, end-stage renal failure on hemodialysis, acute coro￾nary syndrome, or hypernatremia with serum sodium concen￾tration > 145 mEq/L. Patients who are dependent on or 
planned to receive any mechanical supports such as ventricular 
assist devices, intra-aortic balloon pumping, extracorporeal 
membranous oxygenation, mechanical ventilation, or combi￾nation of these devices, are also excluded. Patients with im￾paired consciousness who lack a sense of thirst or have diffi -
culty in oral intake are excluded from the study. Patients with 
baseline urine osmolality of < 350 mOsm/L, which also can be 
calculated by the formula 2 × [urinary sodium concentration 
(mEq/L)] + [urinary urea nitrogen concentration (mg/dL)] /2.8 
+ [urinary creatinine concentration (mg/dL)] × 2/3 + 16,18) are 
also excluded considering our previous studies.16)
Study design (Figure): After written informed consent is ob￾tained, patients receive several clinical examinations such as 
blood tests measuring serum sodium, potassium, creatinine 
concentration, and plasma B-type natriuretic peptide concen￾tration, a chest X-ray test, physical assessment, transthoracic 
echocardiogram, and Minnesota Living with Heart Failure 
Questionnaire (MHLHFQ) during 1-3 days of the observation 
period before the randomization. When eligible for this study, 
patients are enrolled and randomized into each of 2 different 
treatment arms, ie TLV add-on group and conventional treat￾ment group.
In the TLV add-on group, TLV is initiated at 3.75 mg or 
7.5 mg daily in addition to conventional diuretics, and the tar￾get body weight is set as the level at the latest discharge. Doses 
of TLV and other diuretics can be altered by the attending phy￾sician. TLV can be continued after the study period if neces￾sary. If TLV is discontinued, the patients are excluded from the 
study.
In the conventional treatment group, doses of diuretics 
are adjusted taking into consideration the body weight at the 
latest discharge. If a physician decides to administer TLV, the 
patient is excluded from the study.
The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Commit￾tee of Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo 
(UMIN Clinical Trial Registry Number: UMIN 000009604).
Endpoints: The primary endpoint is patient QOL calculated 
by MHLHFQ during the study period.3,4) Secondary endpoints 
include body weight, NYHA class, cardio-thoracic ratio, ejec￾tion fraction, physical congestion, renal function, serum sodi￾um concentration, and plasma B-type natriuretic peptide con￾centration during the study period.
Statistical analysis: The total sample size consists of 50 pa￾tients in the TLV group and 50 patients in the conventional 
treatment group considering the result of a power analysis (al￾pha error probability, 0.05; power, 0.80). Categorical variables 
are summarized as frequencies and percentages, and are com￾pared using the chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test as appro￾priate. Continuous variables are represented as the mean ± 
standard deviation unless otherwise specifi ed, and compared 
using the unpaired t-test or Mann-Whitney test as appropriate. 
All hypothesis tests reported are two-tailed, and use a P < 0.05 
as signifi cant.
Discussion
The AQUA-TLV study is designed to evaluate the long￾term clinical advantage of TLV add-on therapy over conven￾tional diuretic therapy by assessing the improvement of QOL 
in patients with congestive HF during a 6 month period.
The EVEREST trial is thus far the only prospective trial 
that has analyzed the long-term effi cacy of TLV from the view￾point of prognosis in patients with mild to moderate HF, but 
failed to show the benefi t of TLV over placebo.13) However, as 
discussed below the EVEREST trial has several potential is￾sues in the study design to lessen the effi cacy of TLV. There￾fore, we here propose the AQUA-TLV study to clarify the ef￾fectiveness of TLV on a long-term basis.
Inclusion/exclusion criteria: First of all, long-term administra￾tion of TLV is best indicated among patients with advanced 
HF who have a previous history of multiple hospitalizations 
regardless of being prescribed a considerable amount of con￾ventional diuretics. In other words, most de novo HF can pos￾sibly be treated solely by low doses of conventional diuretics 
without TLV. The no-better-than placebo result of the EVER￾EST trial may have resulted from the enrollment criteria, 
which allowed de novo HF patients into the TLV-treatment 
arm. Many previous reports agreed that furosemide ≥ 80 mg/
day was signifi cantly associated with higher mortality in pa￾tients with HF,26,27) and 60 mg/day could be a reasonable 
number for a lower limit of furosemide in our inclusion crite￾ria. Collectively, the inclusion criteria of our study are essential 
to select patients who are refractory to conventional diuretics, 
and such patients would be better candidates for long-term ad￾ministration of TLV.
As for the serum sodium concentration, only 11% of the 
patients had hyponatremia in the EVEREST trial,13) and the 
rate was less than half that of other studies.28,29) In the sub-anal￾ysis of the EVEREST trial, patients with severe hyponatremia

(< 130 mEq/L) enjoyed a better prognostic benefi t from TLV 
treatment compared to the placebo group. Increases in serum 
sodium concentration by TLV treatment itself may possibly 
improve the long-term prognosis in patients with progressed 
HF.30) Fortunately, at least 20% of the patients enrolled in the 
AQUA-TLV trial will be hyponatremia patients based on our 
recent experience.16)
Moreover, the EVEREST trial might have included non￾responders to TLV. The effi cacy of TLV is limited only to re￾sponders, as we reported.20,21) Nonresponders are associated 
with reduced ability to concentrate and dilute urine, which is 
probably due to dysfunction of the collecting ducts and/or loss 
of the medullar osmotic gradient.18) We recently proposed new 
criteria with a baseline urine osmolality of ≥ 350 mOsm/L that 
can effi ciently predict responsiveness to TLV.16) By using these 
criteria, we can exclude nonresponders to TLV. The EVEREST 
study only enrolled patients with reduced ejection fraction, but 
according to our recent data,16) responders had better clinical 
outcomes regardless of the level of left ventricular ejection 
fraction. We do not exclude patients with preserved ejection 
fraction from the AQUA-TLV study.
Endpoint: Time to the fi rst rehospitalization due to HF was 
analyzed as an endpoint in the EVEREST trial, but there was 
no signifi cant difference between the TLV and placebo groups 
in the observational period that averaged approximately 10 
months.13) It may be diffi cult for TLV treatment to signifi cantly 
inhibit rehospitalization among patients with refractory HF 
over such a short period. Instead of clinical endpoints, we ana￾lyze patient QOL as a primary endpoint in this study. We have 
previously demonstrated that better QOL has signifi cant corre￾lation with improved composite endpoints including cardiac 
death as well as HF hospitalizations in patients with HF.3)
Limitations: 1. Because we can change the dose of diuretics 
such as furosemide during the study period in the TLV group, 
we would not be able to evaluate the pure benefit of TLV. 
However, we would like to analyze the real clinical effect of 
TLV in clinical settings, and we often introduce TLV together 
with dose adaptation of diuretics in order to minimize the ad￾verse effects.
2. The study period is set at 6 months in this study. Long￾er observation periods may provide convincing evidence for 
the longer-term safety and effi cacy of TLV. However, the se￾verity of HF in patients with stage D HF would not permit 
longer observation.
Conclusion: The AQUA-TLV study is the first prospective, 
open-labeled, randomized TLV add-on trial versus convention￾al treatment in patients with decompensated HF designed to 
evaluate the long-term effi cacy of TLV from the viewpoint of 
patient QOL.
