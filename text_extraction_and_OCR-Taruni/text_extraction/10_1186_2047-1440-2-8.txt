Abstract
Background: Most studies have found cold ischemic time to be an important predictor of delayed graft function in
kidney transplantation. Relatively less is known about the warm time associated with vascular anastomosis and early
outcomes.
Methods: A retrospective cohort of 298 consecutive solitary deceased donor kidney recipients from January 2006
to August 2012 was analyzed to examine the association between anastomosis time and delayed graft function
(need for dialysis) and length of hospital stay.
Results: Delayed graft function (DGF) was observed in 56 patients (18.8%). The median anastomosis time was 30
minutes (interquartile range 24, 45 minutes). Anastomosis time was independently associated with DGF in a
multivariable, binary logistic regression analysis (odds Ratio (OR) 1.037 per minute, 95% CI 1.016, 1.057, P = 0.001).
An anastomosis time >29 minutes was also associated with a 3.5 fold higher (OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.6, 7.3, P = 0.001) risk
of DGF. Median days in hospital was 9 (interquartile range 7, 14 days). Every 5 minutes of longer anastomosis time
(0.20 days per minute, 95% CI 0.13, 0.27, P <0.001) was associated with 1 extra day in hospital in a multivariable
linear regression model. An anastomosis time >29 minutes was associated with 3.8 (95% CI 1.6, 6.0, P <0.001) more
days in hospital.
Conclusion: Anastomosis time may be an underappreciated but modifiable variable in dictating use of hospital
resources. The impact of anastomosis time on longer term outcomes deserves further study.

Background
Over the last two decades cold ischemic time (CIT) has
been found to be an important independent risk factor
for delayed graft function (DGF) in deceased donor kid￾ney transplantation [1-4]. DGF is also associated with in￾ferior graft survival and function [1-3]. All supporting
evidence for the adverse events associated with DGF is
derived from cohort studies. DFG likely results in longer
stays in hospital and additional resource use (dialysis).
Surprisingly there are few studies examining the effects
of warm ischemic time (WIT) on DGF [5,6]. The
importance of WIT has become a hot area of research in
Urology especially with greater use of partial nephrec￾tomy for cancer surgery [7,8]. There is also recent infor￾mation that long WITs may reduce graft survival in live
donor kidney transplantation [9].
By definition there are two WITs. The first relates to
organ procurement and the second relates to the vascu￾lar anastomosis time (AT) in the recipient. The purpose
of this study is to examine the second warm time or the
AT during the recipient operation and examine whether
this contributes to delayed graft function.
Methods
Consecutive deceased donor organ transplant recipients
of solitary kidneys were identified in the Program data￾base from January 2006 until August 2012. Combined
organ and living donor transplant procedures were ex￾cluded. Data were extracted retrospectively from our

electronic health records, which came into existence in
January 2006. Approval for this retrospective study was
obtained from our institution’s research ethics board.
All patients received induction with either basiliximab
or antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and all received pre￾operative methylprednisolone (500 mg) intravenously.
ATG was reserved for those who were repeat transplant
recipients, those who received organs from deceased
cardiac donors, and those with a calculated panel react￾ive antibody level >20%. Post-operative patients received
oral tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone. All pa￾tients were treated with sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim
for pneumocystis prophylaxis and oral ranitidine for
gastrointestinal ulcer prophylaxis. For patients on a
proton pump inhibitor pre transplant, this agent was
continued in place of the ranitidine. Cytomegalovirus
(CMV) prophylaxis with valganciclovir was used in
CMV-negative recipients receiving CMV-positive organs
and CMV-positive recipients receiving ATG. All patients
received subcutaneous heparin for venous thrombo￾embolism prophylaxis.
Data extracted included recipient age, gender, body
mass index (BMI), weight, calculated panel reactive anti￾bodies (cPRA), human leukocyte antigen mismatch
(HLA MM), cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD),
diabetes mellitus status at transplantation, duration of
dialysis pretransplantation, blood transfusion pre trans￾plantation, CIT, donor cause of death, donor age, gender,
BMI, weight, terminal creatinine, and donation after cir￾culatory death (DCD) versus neurologic death. Since
over 96% of the population was non-black, race was not
included in the analysis. AT was defined as the time be￾tween the end of the cooling period to successful renal
artery anastomosis and perfusion of the donor kidney. In
the few patients requiring reoperation the cross-clamped
warm time of the second operation was included. The
first warm time from the procurement process was not
included. This first warm time is generally much shorter
than the second [5]. The outcomes were DGF (defined
as need for dialysis post transplantation within the first
week), days in hospital, and recipient serum creatinine
level at day 7.
Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation for
continuous variables with a normal distribution and me￾dian and interquartile range (IQR) for those variables
not distributed normally. Differences in AT between
groups with or without delayed graft function were
tested by the Kruskal-Wallis test. Variables associated
with DGF were examined by binary logistic regression
analysis. Variables associated with days in hospital and
serum creatinine on day 7 were examined by linear re￾gression analysis. Variables examined for statistical asso￾ciations with outcomes were recipient age, gender, BMI,
weight, cPRA, HLA MM, duration of dialysis, blood
transfusion pre transplantation (never versus yes), dia￾betes mellitus status at transplantation, CIT, donor cause
of death (anoxia versus other, and cerebrovascular event
versus other), donor age, gender, weight, BMI, terminal
serum creatinine, DCD, and AT. Variables that were sig￾nificant at P <0.1 in a univariable analysis were included
into the multivariable models. Overall significance was
assumed at the P = 0.05 level (two-sided). Statistical ana￾lysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics software
version 20.0 (New York, NY, USA).
Results
In this retrospective cohort of 307 consecutive deceased
donor solitary kidney transplant recipients in the data￾base, ATs were available in 298 subjects. The nine (2.9%)
missing subjects were excluded from the analysis. Of the
remaining 298 patients, 56 (18.8%) had DGF. Character￾istics of the patients are shown in Table 1. Figure 1

shows the distribution of ATs in the study. Since the dis￾tribution is significantly skewed the median is the more
appropriate descriptor (median 30 minutes, IQR 24, 45
minutes). Figure 2 (box and whisker plot) shows that pa￾tients experiencing DGF had significantly longer ATs.
AT was independently associated with DGF in the binary
logistic regression analysis (odds ratio (OR) 1.037 per
minute, 95% CI 1.016, 1.057, P = 0.001). Other variables
that were significant in the model were DCD (OR 11,
95% CI, 3.3, 34, P <0.001), donor BMI (OR 1.06 per kg/
m2
, 95% CI, 1.003, 1.12, P = 0.041), and dialysis duration
pre transplantation (OR 1.001 per day, 95% CI, 1.000,
1.002, P <0.001). Diabetes mellitus, donor sex, and re￾peat transplants were included in the multivariable
model (P <0.10 in the univariable model) but were not
independently significant. In a separate multivariable
model, an AT >29 minutes was associated with an in￾creased risk of DGF (OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.6, 7.3, P = 0.001).
The median days in hospital was 9 (IQR 7, 14 days).
Figure 3 shows the relationship between AT and days in
hospital (r = 0.32, P <0.001). AT (B coefficient 0.20 days
per minute AT, 95% CI, 0.13, 0.27, P <0.001) was associ￾ated with longer stays in hospital in the multivariable
linear regression analysis model. Therefore every 5 mi￾nutes of longer AT was associated with one extra day in
hospital. Other significant covariables were DCD
(B coefficient 11 days, 95% CI, 7, 16, P <0.001), dialysis
duration pre transplantation (B coefficient 0.002 days
per day, 95% CI, 0.001, 0.003, P = 0.001) and donor sex
(B coefficient 3.5 days for male, 95% CI, 1.4, 5.6,
P = 0.001). Recipient age, diabetes mellitus, donor age,
and repeat transplants were included in the multivari￾able model (P <0.10 in the univariable model) but were
not independently significant. In a separate multivariable
model an AT >29 minutes was associated with 3.8 days
(95% CI 1.6, 6.0, P <0.001) longer in hospital.
The median serum creatinine on day 7 was 168 μmol/L
(IQR 125, 314). AT (B coefficient 4.0 μmol/L per minute
AT, 95% CI, 2.1, 5.0, P <0.001) was associated with higher
day 7 creatinine levels. Other significant factors in the
multivariable model were donor terminal serum creatinine
(B coefficient 1.8 μmol/L per μmol/L, 95% CI, 1.04, 2.5,
P = 0.001) and DCD (B coefficient 312 μmol/L, 95% CI,
213, 411, P <0.001). Recipient sex, recipient weight, dia￾betes mellitus, and donor BMI were included in the multi￾variable model (P <0.10 in the univariable model) but
were not independently significant. An AT >29 minutes
was associated with a higher creatinine at day 7 (B coeffi￾cient 75 μmol/L, 95% CI, 30, 121, P <0.001).
Discussion
AT may be an underappreciated but modifiable variable
in dictating use of hospital resources. There were signifi￾cant increases in both need for dialysis and length of

stay at this center with increased AT. An AT >29 mi￾nutes was associated with particularly worse outcomes.
The study also shows that the serum creatinine was
higher 7 days after transplantation with longer ATs, con￾sistent with slower recovery of kidney function.
Surprisingly few studies have examined WIT as a co￾variate in studies of delayed graft function or survival. In
a normogram to predict DGF, Irish et al. identified WIT
as a significant variable but the overall effect was small
[6]. The reasons why this study demonstrated a greater
effect with AT is not clear since most of the variables in￾cluded in the DGF normogram were also considered in
this study. The DGF normogram was examined in one
center and found to have limited accuracy [10]. In
Grossberg’s study, transplant recipients with and without
DGF had DGF normogram scores that were not signifi￾cantly different. DGF as defined in this paper and by
Irish et al. may not be the best predictor of later graft
function [6]. Moore et al. found the DGF normogram to
be less predictive of later kidney function at 1 year than
other measures. Creatinine at day 5, and to a similar ex￾tent creatinine at day 7 post kidney transplantation were
predictive of later function at 1 year [11]. In a single
center study from the Netherlands of over 1,000 solitary
deceased and live donor kidney recipients transplanted
between 1981 and July 2000, neither the first nor second
warm time was significantly associated with outcomes
[5]. However, a more recent study from the same coun￾try in live donor kidney recipients found that prolonged
warm times (>45 minutes) were associated with a >3-
fold higher risk of graft loss [9]. Most research has
focused on CIT, preservation solutions or the use of
machine perfusion pumps to avoid reperfusion injury
and DGF and these do not directly address the AT [12].
Even the large recent randomized trials such as the
international trial on the use of machine pumps to pre￾vent DGF or recent cohort trials examining risk factors
for DGF did not include WIT in their analysis as a po￾tential confounder [4,13].
There is a growing body of evidence in the urological lit￾erature that WIT in partial nephrectomy is detrimental and
there should be no reason why these adverse effects associ￾ated with WIT would be irrelevant in kidney transplant￾ation [7,8]. Consistent with a debate in the urologic
literature, there may not be a threshold effect and every mi￾nute may count [7]. In a recent publication examining the
effect of WIT in a cohort undergoing partial nephrectomy
of a solitary kidney, it was found that each minute of warm
ischemia was associated with a 6% increased risk of acute
kidney injury and 4% increased risk of new onset ESRD
[14]. Clearly some prolonged times are unavoidable, espe￾cially in those with multiple vessels that have significant
atherosclerosis or that require re-exploration. Minimizing
warm time by back table surgery would also be re￾commended. Recognizing that pursuing speed should not
impact the quality of anastomosis, increasing the awareness
of this issue amongst surgeons may be sufficient to improve
ATs. It might be necessary to include more simulation and
skills laboratory time for trainees to gain adequate expertise
prior to performing anastomoses in clinical practice.
There are significant limitations to this study. This
was retrospective and single center, and long-term ef￾fects on graft or patient survival were not examined be￾cause of the low event rates (98% patient and 96% graft
survival at one year). Given the growing body of clinical
and experimental evidence that acute ischemic kidney
injury is associated with later progressive chronic kidney
disease in the non-transplant setting, a more detailed
analysis of larger registries should be undertaken
[15-17]. If an association between greater AT and worse
long-term graft survival is observed, then there would be
even greater interest in testing early pharmacologic
interventions or devising better means to minimize
the warm time. A number of strategies have been tes￾ted experimentally and in ongoing clinical trials
(clinicaltrials.gov) to prevent ischemia-reperfusion injury.
In addition to previously studied interventions such as
spironolactone in animals, therapies to prevent leukocyte
recruitment and inflammation (NCT00248040), cytokine
damage (NCT00298168) and the use of small interfering
RNAs (NCT00802347) to prevent renal injury may hold
promise [17,18].
In summary, this study highlights the importance of
the anastomosis time in kidney transplantation on short￾term outcomes that may impact long-term outcomes.
More significantly this event may be modifiable, or po￾tentially an area and time for other types of intervention.
