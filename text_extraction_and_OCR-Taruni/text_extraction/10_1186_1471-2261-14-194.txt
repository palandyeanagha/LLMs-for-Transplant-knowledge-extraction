Abstract
Background: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients are more susceptible to suffer from heart failure with
normal ejection fraction (HFNEF). Therefore, it is critical to evaluate the relationship between left ventricular filling
pressure (LVFP) and HFNEF, even if a large proportion of HCM patients have normal LVFP at rest. The objective
was to assess the correlation between exercise tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) and early HFNEF in HCM patients by
treadmill exercise echocardiography combined with cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET).
Method: Twenty-seven non-obstructive HCM patients and 31 age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers were
enrolled in this study. All subjects underwent treadmill exercise echocardiography combined with CPET. N-terminal
pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels were analyzed before and after exercise.
Result: Five HCM patients had normal LVFP at rest and increased after exercise. For this subgroup, the relationship
between minute ventilation and carbon dioxide production (VE/VCO2 slope) and NT-proBNP levels were higher
compared with controls and the subgroup with normal resting and stress LVFP, but was similar to the subgroup
with elevated LVFP both at rest and after exercise.
Conclusion: Elevated LVFP after exercise suggested the occurrence of early HFNEF in patients with
non-obstructive HCM.

Background
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is characterized by
left ventricular hypertrophy and is associated with a wide
array of clinical symptoms and hemodynamic abnormal￾ities, such as left ventricular outflow obstruction, diastolic
dysfunction, myocardial ischemia and mitral regurgitation.
The prevalence of HCM in the United States, Japan and
China is approximately of 1 per 500 adults [1-3]. HCM is
a risk factor for heart failure with normal ejection fraction
(HFNEF) [4,5]. HFNEF has a poor prognosis because it is
often diagnosed and treated late [4,5]. Indeed, in the early
diastolic dysfunction stage, a large proportion of HCM
patients only suffer from impaired exercise tolerance with￾out any other obvious symptoms or signs (such as dyspnea
and edema) before the onset of clinical heart failure [4,5].
Therefore, there is a need to further study the diastolic
dysfunction in these patients.
Elevated left ventricular filling pressure (LVFP) is critical
for HFNEF diagnosis [6]. Under exercise stress, the LVFP
of HFNEF patients will increase sharply because of
the increase of the left ventricular preload [7-10], while
this increase is not observed in adults with normal left
ventricular diastolic function [11].

Tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) has been proved valuable
for assessing LVFP [12-18]. The N-terminal pro-brain
natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is secreted by the ven￾tricles of the heart in response to excessive stretching of
the cardiomyocytes. It is therefore considered a marker of
heart damage, and can be used both for screening and
prognosis of heart failure [19,20]. NT-proBNP is usually
increased in patients with left ventricular dysfunction,
regardless of the presence of symptoms [21].
The aim of this study was to assess the relationship
between exercise TDI and early HFNEF changes in HCM
patients using treadmill exercise echocardiography com￾bined with cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET).
Methods
Study population
HCM patients were enrolled from those who visited
the echocardiography laboratory of the Peking University
Third Hospital between November 2010 and March 2011.
Exclusion criteria were: 1) Patients who had a history of
left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) diag￾nosis; 2) left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <50%; 3)
atrial or ventricular arrhythmia; 4) valvular disease of mo￾derate or greater severity; or 5) pericardial diseases.
Thirty-one age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers
were enrolled as controls. The protocol was approved by
Peking University Institutional Review Board. All subjects
provided a written informed consent before participation.
Echocardiography
Standard 2-dimensional measurements (left ventricle
diastolic and systolic dimensions, intraventricular septum
(IVS), posterior wall thickness (LVPW), left atrial volume,
and left ventricle outflow tract) were obtained with the
patient in the supine position, before and after exercise.
LV mass was calculated using the Devereux formula [22].
After obtaining the resting images from the standard
parasternal and apical views, all subjects were submitted
to symptoms-limited treadmill exercise (modified Bruce
protocol [23]). Right after the subjects stopped exercising,
echocardiography was performed in the supine position,
within one minute of exercise end, using an ultrasound
system (Vivid I, GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA) with
a 2.5-MHz transducer. From the apical window, a 2-mm
pulsed Doppler sample volume was placed at the mitral
valve tip, and mitral flow velocities of 3 cardiac cycles were
recorded, obtaining peak velocities of the early diastolic
transmitral flow (E), of the late diastolic transmitral flow
(A), and of the early diastolic lateral mitral annulus vel￾ocity (Emlateral) were measured by TDI using the pulsed
wave Doppler mode. The filter was set to exclude high
frequency signals, and the Nyquist limit was adjusted to a
range of 15 to 20 cm/s. Gain and sample volume were
minimized to allow for a clear tissue signal with minimal
background noise. Emlateral was measured from the apical
4-chamber view with a 2 mm sample volume placed at the
lateral corner of the mitral annulus. These measurements
were made at baseline and during recovery, in the same
sequence. Measurements were recorded with simultan￾eous electrocardiography. All data were digitally stored.
Cardiopulmonary exercise testing
Each subject was submitted to a symptoms-limited modi￾fied Bruce protocol [23] treadmill CPET under the supervi￾sion of a qualified exercise physiologist and a physician.
Expired gases were collected continuously throughout ex￾ercise and analyzed for ventilatory volume (VE), and for
oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) content by a profes￾sional analyzer. Expired gases were reported every 30 sec￾onds, and were reported as peak oxygen consumption
(VO2max, ml/kg/min), peak respiratory exchange ratio (the
ratio of CO2 production to O2 consumption at peak effort),
and VE/VCO2 slope (the slope of the increase in peak ven￾tilation/increase in CO2 production throughout exercise).
Heart monitoring consisted of continuous 12-lead elec￾trocardiography, automatic blood pressure measurements,
and heart rate (HR) recordings at every stage via the
electrocardiogram. Test termination criteria were: 1)
patient’s request; 2) ventricular tachycardia; 3) 2 mm
or more of horizontal or down sloping ST-segment de￾pression; or 4) a drop in systolic blood pressure (SBP) of
20 mm Hg or more.
NT-proBNP measurement
Blood samples for analysis of NTproBNP were obtained
before the start of exercise and at maximal exercise.
Serum NT-proBNP levels were determined using an
electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay according to
the manufacturer's instructions performed on a Cobas
E601 (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland).
Statistical analysis
Normally distributed continuous variables are expressed
as means ± SD. Non-normally distributed continuous va￾riables were log-transformed to normalize their distri￾bution for analysis. Categorical data are expressed as
percentages. Variables between the study groups were
compared by the Student’s t-test and by one-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA). Non-parametric tests were used
in cases of unequal variances. Variables at rest and
peak stress within each group were compared by the
Student’s t-test and categorical data were compared
by the pearsonchi-square test. Differences were considered
significant when the p-value was <0.05. All analyses
were performed using SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago,
IL, USA).

Results
Patients' characteristics
Two hundred and sixty-eight patients were screened;
103 patients suffered from atrial fibrillation, 43 refused
to participate, 39 patients could not be contacted, 12
patients suffered from left ventricular outflow tract
obstruction, 35 suffered from severe mitral valve regur￾gitation, 5 had a hydropericardium, and 4 patients had
limited physical capacities. Therefore, 27 patients were in￾cluded. The clinical characteristics of HCM patients and
controls are compared in Table 1. There were no differ￾ences in age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and comor￾bidities (hypertension and diabetes).
Hemodynamic and echocardiographic parameters are
compared in Table 2. There were no statistical differ￾ences in resting and stress HR (p = 0.621 and 0.086,
resepectively) and SBP (p = 0.955 and 0.615, respect￾ively) between the two groups. Standard echocardiog￾raphy showed that there were no differences in LVEF,
LVESD and LVEDD (all P > 0.05). However, the HCM
patients displayed larger LAD, LAA, IVS, LVPW and
LVMI (all p < 0.01) (Table 2).
Doppler mitral inflow
The baseline peak velocity of E in the HCM group was
lower than in controls (0.61 ± 0.16 vs. 0.72 ± 0.15, P < 0.05).
There were no differences in other mitral inflow variables
between the two groups.
TDI parameters
Both baseline and stress Emlateral of the HCM group
were lower than in controls (baseline: 8.1 ± 2.6 vs. 11.3 ±
2.3, p < 0.001; 10.3 ± 3.2 vs. 13.3 ± 2.8 p <0.01). There
was no difference in baseline Smlateral between the two
groups (baseline: 9.1 ± 2.3 vs. 9.7 ± 2.0, p > 0.05). But
stress Smlateral of the HCM group were lower than in
controls (14.3 ± 4.1vs. 16.3 ± 3.0 p <0.05) (Table 2). Both
baseline and exercise E/Emlateral were higher in HCM
patients (baseline: 8.0 ± 2.5 vs. 6.5 ± 1.5, P < 0.01; exer￾cise: 9.1 ± 3.0 vs. 7.1 ± 1.3, P < 0.01). E/Emlateral increased
after exercise in HCM patients (from 8.0 ± 2.5 to 9.1 ± 3.0,
P < 0.01), but not in controls (from 6.5 ± 1.5 to 7.1 ± 1.3,
P = 0.085) (Table 3).
CPET parameters
For HCM patients, VO2max was lower (24.3 ± 5.2 vs. 27.6 ±
3.9, P < 0.01) and VE/VCO2 slope was higher (28.8 ± 4.0
vs. 26.9 ± 2.7, P < 0.05) than in controls (Table 4). No
LVOTO was observed in the HCM patients after CPET.
NT-proBNP
In HCM patients, both baseline and exercise NT-proBNP
were higher than in controls (baseline: 884 vs. 72 pg/ml,
P < 0.001; exercise: 1019 vs. 79 pg/ml, P < 0.001) (Table 4).

Subgroups comparisons
According to an E/Emlateral above or below 10 before
and after exercise, the HCM group could be divided into
3 subgroups: group A (n = 17, baseline and stress
E/Emlateral < 10), group B (n = 5, baseline E/Emlateral < 10,
and stress E/Emlateral > 10), and group C (n = 5, baseline
and stress E/Emlateral > 10) (Table 5). In group B, the
E/Emlateral ratio was increased in all patients (P < 0.05)
(Figure 1). There were no differences in age, BMI, LVEDD,
LVESD and LVEF between the controls and the three
HCM subgroups. The VE/VCO2 slope in group B was
similar to that of group C (p > 0.05), but was higher
compared with group A (p < 0.05) and controls (p < 0.05)
(Figure 2). NT-proBNP in group B was similar to that of
group C (p > 0.05), but was higher compared with group
A (p < 0.05) and controls (p < 0.01) (Figures 3 and 4).
Discussion
The main goal of this study was to assess the value of
exercise TDI in early HFNEF detection in HCM patients
by treadmill exercise echocardiography combined with
CPET. These preliminary results showed that the higher
E/Em, the worse the outcomes. E/Em may rise in a minor￾ity of patients following exercise, in whom it was normal
at rest. This may indicate a rise in filling pressure during
exertion and mild HFNEF. In addition, differences in
stress E/Em appears to be mainly driven by the lower Em
since mitral E wave peak velocity was not different
between the groups.
Impaired exercise tolerance is the most common
symptom in HCM patients [24]. Because diastolic dys￾function reduces the filling of the left ventricle, the heart
cannot pump enough blood to satisfy the needs of the
body when exercising, thus causing damage to the heart
due to exercise intolerance and raised LVFP [25,26].
However, it is also possible that the cause of exercise
intolerance might be secondary to the inability of the
stroke volume to increase appropriately because of
abnormal sarcomeric protein causing abnormal con￾tractility and reduced inotropic reserve [26,27]. We ob￾served that HCM patients had higher E/Em, VE/VCO2
slope and lower VO2max. Past studies revealed that
VO2max was correlated with prognosis in heart failure
patients [28]. In the present study, impaired VO2max
in HCM patients may be an indicator of their bad
prognosis.
Moreover, during CPET, some individuals could not
reach the anaerobic threshold for some reasons. In this
condition, VO2max cannot reflect the actual exercise
tolerance and diastolic function. It has also been found
that the VE/VCO2 slope, which was negatively corre￾lated with prognosis, was a better indicator of prognosis
in heart failure patients than VO2max, without consider￾ation of reaching the anaerobic threshold or not
[16,29-33]. In the present study, HCM patients had
higher VE/VCO2 slope than controls, suggesting that
HCM patients may have worse outcomes and need to be
treated earlier.

We observed that the LVFP of about 20% of our HCM
patients was significantly higher immediately after exercise
(baseline E/Em < 10 and stress E/Em > 10, group b), and
that these patients may be diagnosed as early or latent
HFNEF. As previously mentioned, the VE/VCO2 slope and
NT-proBNP levels are negatively correlated with prognosis
[16,19-21,29-33]. These two prognostic indexes were
similar between groups B (i.e. latent HFNEF group) and C
(i.e. clinical HFNEF), but were higher than in group A,
suggesting unfavorable outcomes of early HFNEF in HCM
patients. Thus, early HFNEF in HCM patients might
require a particular medical attention.
Our results are supported by some previously published
studies. Kitaoka et al. [34] showed that TDI after CPET
was more useful than BNP levels for predicting objective
capacity in HCM patients. However, they did not assess
HFNEF onset. Another study by the same author showed
that a high septal ratio and elevated BNP levels discri￾minated HCM patients who suffered from a cardiac event
vs. those who did not [35]. Finally, a study suggested that
TDI was useful for risk stratification of HCM patients, but
BNP levels were not assessed [36].
Em measurement might have been affected by sample
size, gain, filter and minimal angulation with annular
motion. We selected the lateral mitral annulus, because
it is easy to obtain measurements from this site from the
apical window. We had experienced technician to ensure
the reproducibility and to minimize the variability. Em
was reduced in patients with annular calcification and
mitral stenosis, and was increased in patients with moder￾ate to severe mitral regurgitation. Therefore, these patients
were not included in our study. In addition, E velocity
could decrease rapidly after exercise; therefore, we mea￾sured E velocity within one minute after exercise termin￾ation. Because of the relatively small number of enrolled

patients, larger studies are needed to prove the value of
exercise TDI in diagnosis of HFNEF in HCM patients.
However, the use of control patients enhances the
reliability of our study.
Conclusions
In conclusion, the results suggest that the LVFP of HCM
patients was higher than healthy adults and that exercise
TDI have a potential value for early HFNEF diagnosis in
HCM patients.
