Abstract
Background: Despite left ventricular (LV) dysfunction contributing to mortality in chronic heart 
failure (HF), the molecular mechanisms of LV failure continues to remain poorly understood and 
myocardial biomarkers have yet to be identified. The aim of this pilot study was to investigate specific 
transcriptome changes occurring in cardiac tissues of patients with HF compared to healthy condition 
patients to improve diagnosis and possible treatment of affected subjects. 
Methods: Unlike other studies, only dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) (n = 2) and restrictive cardio￾myopathy (RCM) (n = 2) patients who did not report family history of the disease were selected with 
the aim of obtaining a homogeneous population for the study. The transcriptome of all patients were 
studied by RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) and the read counts were adequately filtered and normalized 
using a recently developed user-friendly tool for RNA-Seq data analysis, based on a new graphical user 
interface (RNA-SeqGUI).
Results: By using this approach in a pairwise comparison with healthy donors, we were able to identify 
DCM- and RCM-specific expression signatures for protein-coding genes as well as for long noncoding 
RNAs (lncRNAs). Differential expression of 5 genes encoding different members of the mediator com￾plex was disclosed in this analysis. Interestingly, a significant alteration was found for genes which had 
never been associated with HF until now, and 27 lncRNA/mRNA pairs that were significantly altered 
in HF patients. 
Conclusions: The present findings revealed specific expression pattern of both protein-coding and 
lncRNAs in HF patients, confirming that new LV myocardial biomarkers could be reliably identified 
using Next-Generation Sequencing-based approaches. (Cardiol J 2017; 24, 5: 539–553)

Introduction 
Cardiomyopathies are a heterogeneous group 
of myocardial diseases resulting in cardiac dysfunc￾tion, which are clinically manifested with heart 
failure (HF). With the rapid evolution of molecular 
genetics in cardiology, the knowledge and literature 
of the complex interplay between genetics and 
cardiomyopathies have significantly expanded over 
the past few decades. Inherited cardiomyopathies 
include a wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes, 
which classically include dilated cardiomyopathy 
(DCM), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), 
restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM), and others [1]. 
DCM is characterized by an increase in both left 
ventricular (LV) mass and volume with thinning 
and stretching of LV wall [1]. HCM is characterized 
by inappropriate myocardial hypertrophy (without 
identifiable etiology such as hypertension, aortic 
stenosis or other contributing factors), interstitial 
fibrosis, myofiber disarray, disorganized myocardial 
architecture and impaired LV performance [1]. 
RCM is a heart-muscle disease resulting in im￾paired ventricular filling with normal or decreased 
diastolic volume of either or both ventricles [1]. 
However, one phenotypic pattern may progress to 
another, or many others may manifest as more than 
one phenotype [2]. HF is a multi-factorial condition 
occurring in about 2–3% of the adult population 
[2–4]. The main cause is coronary artery disease 
(CAD) and it is a consequence of myocardial in￾farction (MI) [2–4]. The onset and progression of 
HF are closely related to several molecular and 
cellular alterations.
In recent years, advances in drug treatment 
have significantly improved the prognosis of HF pa￾tients. However, there are still several limitations 
on the benefits of medical therapy for patients with 
refractory end-stage disease, which often require 
mechanical support or heart transplantation. Thus, 
the development of novel and effective therapeutic 
treatments for HF is a major challenge today and 
requires a detailed knowledge of HF molecular 
pathogenesis. 
Global gene expression profiling comparing 
disease vs. a healthy condition is a valuable ap￾proach for discovering new potential biomarkers 
for diagnosis/prediction of disease severity and 
for identifying novel drug targets. Particularly, 
whole-transcriptome analysis is increasingly ac￾quiring a key role in the knowledge of mechanisms 
responsible for complex diseases, elucidating the 
involvement of multiple genes and pathways in 
pathological mechanisms. 
Over the last decade, global gene expression 
analysis using microarrays has been widely applied 
to cardiovascular research [5, 6]. Most transcrip￾tome studies on MI have been performed in rodents 
due to higher accessibility to homogenous popula￾tions and myocardial tissue at defined stages of the 
disease [5, 6]. Although gene expression studies 
have elucidated many crucial molecular alterations 
involved in HF pathophysiology, they do not fully 
capture the complexity of human transcriptome 
[7]. Human myocardial tissue is difficult to obtain 
and usually comes from heterogeneous patient 
cohorts, generally in late-stage cardiomyopathies 
of different etiologies leading to HF. Despite these 
limitations, global gene expression analysis using 
microarrays has been widely applied to the field of 
cardiovascular research. However, although gene 
expression studies have elucidated many crucial 
molecular alterations involved in HF pathophysi￾ology, they could not fully capture the complexity 
of human transcriptome [7]. The introduction of 
RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) has overcome some 
drawbacks of previously used technologies, al￾lowing a simultaneous investigation of different 
layers of transcriptome complexity at an in-depth 
level of resolution [8, 9]. Indeed, RNA-Seq analysis 
revealed alterations of cytoskeletal and nucleocyto￾plasmic transport-related genes, as well as of other 
key pathways in HF [7–12]. Interestingly, several 
studies have also highlighted the importance of 
noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) in failing human hearts 
[13, 14]. Currently, the best-characterized ncRNAs 
in the heart are the microRNAs (miRNAs), which 
finely modify mRNA expression through post￾transcriptional silencing. Recently, several miRNAs 
have been found to be associated with cardiovascu￾lar disease (CVD) [13]. Functional analyses have 
demonstrated that several dysregulated miRNAs 
may exert either positive or negative regulatory 
effects on cardiac hypertrophic pathways. Indeed, 
miR-1, miR-133, miR-378, miR-185 and miR-155 
showed anti-hypertrophic effects [15–18]; while 
miR-208 family, miR-212/132, miR-23 and miR-199 
promoted hypertrophy in cardiomyocytes [19, 20]. 
Unlike miRNAs, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) 
are much less well characterized, and how they 
function in biology and gene regulation remains an 
attractive area of investigation [14].
In the last several years, some lncRNAs have 
been identified and their function has been impli￾cated in different biological processes. However, 
only a few lncRNAs were associated to cardiomy￾opathy and heart biology, as myosin heavy chain￾associated RNA transcript (MHRT) [21]. It is

a cluster of lncRNAs transcribed from the MYH7 
gene that encodes the bMHC protein. MHRT ex￾pression is heart specific and it is expressed at low 
levels in the fetal heart, increasing in the adult heart. 
Furthermore, higher levels of long intergenic RNA 
(lincRNA) predicting cardiac remodeling (LIPCAR) 
in plasma from HF patients following ischemic car￾diomyopathy were independently associated with 
an elevated risk for future cardiovascular death and 
predictive for LV remodeling [22]. This effect was 
also reported for ANRIL, KCNQ1OT1, MIAT, and 
MALAT1 in a cohort of 414 MI patients [23]. Nev￾ertheless, the specific functions of these transcripts 
within the heart or vascular tissue remain relatively 
unknown. Moreover, ANRIL was shown to be highly 
expressed in atherosclerotic plaques and might be an 
accurate regulator in the inflammatory nuclear factor 
kappa B pathway [24]. Therefore, the importance 
of the altered expression of lncRNAs in human HF 
induces exploration of their putative involvement 
and functional roles in myocardial disease [24].
In this pilot study, a systematic transcrip￾tome analysis was performed, by RNA-Seq on 
myocardial tissue specimens from HF patients vs. 
healthy donors (HD) in order to reveal evidence of 
a distinctive expression network signature in end￾stage HF diseased hearts. This approach may offer 
important insights into the complex pathogenesis 
of advanced cardiac failure, as well as for identify￾ing potential targets for therapeutic intervention. 
Initially highlighted were classic heart disease￾associated coding and noncoding genes, whose 
expression was significantly altered as MYH6, 
MYH7 and MHRT. Then, differentially expressed 
genes (DEGs) were screened and their possible 
roles in the pathogenesis of HF were explored by 
using multiple bioinformatics methods to identify 
specific transcriptomic signatures. 
Methods 
Patients and tissue samples collection
This study was performed according to the 
principles outlined in the Helsinki Declaration, and 
was approved by the local Ethics Committee. Eight 
heart biopsies were collected from heart trans￾plantation candidates. The diagnosis of HF (DCM, 
n = 2; RCM, n = 2) was determined by medical 
history, pathological and instrumental examination. 
LV tissue specimens (n = 4 for organ donors and 
n = 4 for recipients) were acquired during surgical 
intervention at the “Monaldi” Hospital. Cardiac 
tissue samples were harvested and snap frozen 
in liquid nitrogen at the time of cardiac surgery. 
Clinical features of patients are shown in Table 1. 
RNA extraction, library preparation 
and sequencing
Heart tissue samples were homogenized by 
Tissue Lyser Disruption system (Qiagen) and total 
RNA was isolated with TRIzol Reagent (Invitro￾gen) according to manufacturer protocol. cDNA 
library preparation was performed starting from 
4 µg of total RNA using Illumina TruSeq Librar￾ies and then sequenced at high coverage on the 
Illumina HiSeq2000 Next-Generation Sequencing 
(NGS) platform available at Tigem Institute in 
Pozzuoli (Naples) [25]. (RNA integrity and quality 
are detailed in Supplementary Methods — see 
journal website).

RNA-Seq data analysis
The quality control on raw reads was per￾formed using FastQC (http://www.bioinformatics.
babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). High-quality 
reads were mapped to the human reference tran￾scriptome (Ensembl v70) and to human reference 
genome (GRCh37/hg19) using TopHat2 v2.0.10 
[26]. Only unique mapped reads were used to 
quantify gene expression in each sample. Gene 
expression as reads counts were estimated after 
filtering (Proportion test implemented in NOISe￾qBio package in R) and normalization of raw reads 
counts using RNA-SeqGUI developed in R lan￾guage [27]. Principal component analysis (PCA), 
mean average and density plots were generated 
using the graphical user interface (GUI). Differ￾ential expression between patients was evaluated 
using the non-parametric NOISeqBIO function [28] 
implemented in RNA-SeqGUI. A posterior prob￾ability (PP) > 0.95 was used to determine DEGs. 
RNA-Seq datasets were submitted to GEO public 
resource and the accession number to the data 
files is GSE71613 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE71613). 
Gene ontology and pathway analysis
The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genom￾es (KEGG) (http://www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/) [29] 
is an authoritative database containing a variety of 
biochemical pathways. In addition, the Database 
for Annotation, Visualization and Integration Dis￾covery (DAVID) (https://david.ncifcrf.gov) [30] is 
a gene functional classification tool that organizes 
and condenses abundant heterogeneous annota￾tion content. Functional enrichment analysis was 
conducted in order to recognize the DEG enriched 
biochemical pathways using KEGG database, gene 
ontology (GO) associated biological functions and 
PANTHER Gene analysis tools version 10.0 (http://
www.pantherdb.org/tools) [31]. Furthermore, 
DAVID online tools were applied for the GO and 
KEGG pathway enrichment analyses with a p value 
set to < 0.05 (according to Benjamini-Hochberg 
correction) were considered significantly enriched.
Because of a lack of strand specificity in the 
sequencing protocol, for the analysis of lncRNAs, 
only intergenic RNAs and antisense RNAs were 
selected — annotated in Ensembl v70 — ex￾cluding transcripts showing overlap with protein 
coding genes. Transcriptional start sites (TSSs) 
of lncRNAs and protein-coding genes were down￾loaded from Ensembl v70 annotation, using the 
tool Table Browser of UCSC Genome Browser 
(http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables) [32]. 
Differentially expressed lncRNAs, between LV 
tissues from HF vs. HD samples, were associated 
with the nearest TSS of protein coding genes using 
the function “closestBed” of BEDTools [33] with 
default parameters. 
Data validation by qRT-PCR 
and statistical analysis 
One microgram of total RNA, from HF patients 
and HD, was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using 
the SuperScript® IV (Invitrogen), following the 
manufacturer’s protocol. Primer sequences and 
corresponding polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
conditions are shown in the Table S1 (see journal 
website, supplementary file). Gene expression 
was quantitatively determined by quantitative 
real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis (detailed in 
Supplementary Methods — see journal web￾site). Results were analyzed by threshold cycle 
(Ct) approach and normalized to RPS18, used as 
housekeeping gene [34]. Relative expression levels 
of the target genes were shown as fold change (FC), 
calculated through the 2–DDCt method [34]. Results 
are reported as mean ± standard error of three 
single experiments. Differences between experi￾mental groups were analyzed by the ANOVA and
t Student’s tests, considering significant a p value
< 0.05 (*) and particularly significant a p < 0.01 (**).
Results
Transcriptome analysis of cardiac tissues 
This pilot study investigates the changes 
occurring in the transcriptome of cardiac tissues 
in HF patients and healthy subjects by RNA-Seq 
technology. Clinical characteristics of individuals 
are reported in Table 1. We isolated total RNA 
from LV myocardium of patients with DCM and 
RCM obtained at the time of heart transplantation. 
Control samples were obtained from transplant do￾nor hearts. The cause of death in these individuals 
was road accident. All HD had no history of myo￾cardial disease or active infections or significant 
comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes and 
hypercholesterolemia at the time of transplanta￾tion. Three of four subjects were female (77%) 
with a mean age of 58 ± 11.7 years. Donors and 
recipients were of Caucasian ethnicity.
Globally, RNA-Seq produced paired-end reads 
with a sufficient quality and read coverage per 
sample to perform reliable gene expression analy￾sis (Fig. S1A–C — see journal website) [35]. 
The expression levels of protein-coding and non￾coding genes have been analyzed for all samples.

Multidimensional scaling analysis confirmed high 
correlation and reproducibility among individual 
samples of each group (Fig. S1D — see journal 
website). PCA revealed that the two different 
groups of patients, with different HF etiology 
(DMC/RCM), significantly differed (Fig. S1E — 
see journal website). RNA-Seq revealed that 
about 15,800 genes (Ensembl v70) were expressed 
in heart specimens and about 500 of them are cur￾rently annotated as lncRNAs by the GENCODE 
Consortium. As the classification of lncRNAs is 
far from complete and most of these transcripts 
overlap protein-coding loci, the focus was specifi￾cally on the lincRNAs and antisense lncRNAs that 
can be unequivocally quantified by RNA-Seq. As 
a general observation there were significant differ￾ences between HF and HD transcriptomes, an at￾tempt was made to identify genes with differential 
expression that were potentially associated with 
disease etiology.
Significant alterations in the protein-coding 
transcriptome of HF vs. HD
RNA-SeqGUI allows virtually quantifying all 
expressed genes in a cell or tissue [15]. The initial 
determination for each sample was the expression 
level of 56,622 loci (Ensembl v70), then the focus 
turned to the identification of DEGs between the 
groups under evaluation. First, we compared the 
gene expression profiles of HF vs. HD; next, DCM 
vs. HD; finally, RCM vs. HD subjects.
Data analysis revealed that 2,428; 470 and 
3,685 genes were significantly altered in the 
three groups, respectively (Fig. 1A). The degree 
of differential expression was variable and ranged 
from +6.3 to –5.3 log2FC between HF and HD;

from +10.6 to –5.5 log2FC between DCM and HD 
and from +6.4 to –5.9 log2FC between RCM and 
HD. Most of DEGs (about 78%, 61%, and 65%, 
respectively) were significantly overexpressed in 
HF, DCM, and RCM patients, indicating a strong in￾duction in gene transcription. As shown in Table 2, 
the HAPLN1 gene is always up-regulated when 
HF was analyzed, DCM and RCM groups (log￾2FC = +6.3; +6.2 and +6.4, respectively). 
Furthermore, the two most up-regulated genes 
were: CFAP61 and COL9A1 (log2FC = +4.6 and 
+4.5) in HF group; MTRNR2L1 and MYOZ1 
(log2FC = +10.6 and +5.3) in DCM group; and 
CFAP61 and COL9A1 (log2FC = +5.0 for both 
genes) in RCM group. Similarly, the three most 
down-regulated genes were TRAJ39, TRAJ49, 
and CTRB1 (log2FC = –5.3; –4.7 and –4.7) when 
HF vs. HD was analyzed; TRAJ39, CTRB1, 
and CXCL14 (log2FC = –5.5; –4.9 and –4.6) in 
DCM vs. HD; and RSPO4, EDN2, and SELE 
(log2FC = –5.9; –5.7 and –5.7) in RCM vs. control 
group (Table 2).
Interestingly, RNA-Seq analysis revealed the 
differential expression of 5 genes encoding different 
subunits of the mediator complex (MED): MED12, 
MED13L, MED14, MED17, MED23 (Fig. 1B; 
Table 3) (see the discussion section below). 
Gene ontology and KEGG pathway 
enrichment analysis of DEGs
DAVID, Venny and Pathway analysis tools 
were used to determine molecular processes and 
biological pathways associated with the DEGs 
detected. We first associated differentially ex￾pressed mRNAs with three structured networks: 
biological process (BP), molecular function (MF) 
and cellular component (CC) in HF patients only 
(Tables S2–S5 — see journal website, sup￾plementary file). Results showed a significant 
enrichment (p < 0.05 adjusted by the accepted 
Benjamini-Hochberg correction method) of par￾ticular biological processes when specific genes 
were altered. In particular, bioinformatic analysis 
revealed a significant alteration of “focal adhesion”,

“regulation of actin cytoskeleton” and “oxidative 
phosphorylation” (adjusted p values 5.64–11, 2.30–1
and 1.27–12, respectively) (Fig. 1C). 
The GO analysis further validated this experi￾mental set up, demonstrating that many biological 
processes and molecular functions, already associ￾ated with HF, were also enriched in these datasets, 
including “cell-adhesion”, “cell-proliferation”, 
“cell-differentiation”, “transcription”, “apoptosis”, 
“proteolysis”, etc. (Fig. 1D; Tables S2–S5). Next, 
by KEGG pathway analysis found a number of 
biological pathways characterized by up- or down￾regulated genes when under comparison (Fig. 2). 
The predominant up- and down-regulated pathways 
are summarized in Table S5, including related 
genes (345 up- and 239 down-regulated), and top 
10 are represented in Figure 2A, B. Specific DEGs 
of the first two classes significantly altered are 
shown in Figure 2C–E (up-regulated DEGs) and 
Figure 2D–F (down-regulated DEGs). 
Based on Pubmed literature, some genes which 
had not been previously reported showed an asso￾ciation with human heart tissue. Among them, for 
instance, ADAMTS8 and ADAMTSL4 were local￾ized predominantly in plasma cells and lung tissue 
(Table S6 — see journal website, supplemen￾tary file) [36]. ADAMTS8 and ADAMTSL4 genes 
were particularly down-regulated in HF vs. HD 
(–4.54 fold; false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05 and 
–2.62 fold; FDR < 0.05 respectively). Both genes 
and many others in GO categories constitute an 
extremely rich source for potential target genes in 
HF understanding and prevention (Tables S2–S5). In 
addition, KEGG analysis demonstrated that several 
pathways were also altered in HF compared to HD; 
particularly in Figure 3A, were shown “cell adhe￾sion molecules” pathway and graphically, heatmaps 
were also reported (Fig. 3B–C) of “focal adhesion” 
(39 up- and 9 down-regulated genes) and “cardiac 
muscle contraction” (3 up- and 20 down-regulat￾ed genes) significantly altered in all HF patients
(Fig. 3A–C; Table S5). Finally, in order to identify
a potential disease-specific signature, gene ex￾pression levels were compared in DCM and RCM 
groups. The Figure S1D–E (Fig. S1D–E — see 
journal website, supplementary file) shows the 
PCA of the distinct considered groups: DCM and 
RCM compared to HD, providing a quick display of 
overall variability in screening and can highlight in￾consistent samples. 114 genes were found in which 
expression was significantly altered between the 
two conditions, using mean gene expression values 
of HD as the background condition (Fig. S2A–C — 
see journal website, supplementary file). As 
shown in Figure S2D clusters of disease-specific 
genes belonging to the “TNF signaling pathway”, 
“phagosome”, “cytokine-cytokine receptor interac￾tion” were identified.
In the analysis of DCM vs. HD, DEGs were 
470 ranging between FC = –5.5 (like TRAJ39 gene) 
and FC = +10.6 (MTRNR2L1 gene). Of all DEGs 
about 61% (285 genes) were up-regulated and 39% 
(185 genes) were down-regulated. In analysis of 
RCM vs. HD, DEGs were 3,685 ranging between

a FC = –5.9 (like RSPO4 gene) and FC = +6.4 
(HAPLN1 gene). Of all DEGs about 65% (2,390 
genes) were up-regulated and 35% (1,295 genes) 
were down-regulated. 
The similarly of HF vs. HD comparisons, DCM 
and RCM DEGs compared to non-failing hearts 
were examined by GO and KEGG enrichment 
analyses separately. DEGs with higher expression 
levels in DCM were enriched for “cardiovascular” 
(p = 5.0 × 10–5) in disease class and were enriched 
for “cardiac muscle contraction” (p = 2.0 × 10–6) 
in KEGG pathway. The GO analysis showed that 
the DEGs clustered in MF, BP, and CC and were 
significantly enriched for terms related to “extra￾cellular region” (p = 1.6 × 10–13) and “cell junction”
(p = 3.3 × 10–4). Similarly, DEGs with higher ex￾pression levels in RCM were enriched for “cardio￾vascular” (p = 2.4 × 10–12) in disease class. Instead, 
KEGG analysis was significantly enriched for “focal 
adhesion” (p = 1.6 × 10–3) and “ECM-receptor 
interaction” (p = 2.9 × 10–3). Finally, GO analysis 
showed that RCM DEGs clustered in MF, BP, and 
CC and were significantly enriched for terms re￾lated to “cell adhesion molecules” (p = 3.9 × 10–3) 
and “cardiac muscle contraction” (p = 1.3 × 10–2).
Transcriptome analysis of failing hearts 
identifies differentially expressed lncRNAs
Since lncRNA are emerging as crucial contrib￾utors to human diseases, the aim of this investiga￾tion was whether these non-coding RNAs may po￾tentially have a role in HF. Therefore a systematic 
analysis of RNA-Seq datasets to identify lncRNAs 
differentially expressed (DE) was undertaken in 
Figure 2. Pathway analysis of the top 10 significantly altered genes; A, B. Pathway analysis of the top 10 significantly

HF vs. HD. In this data-driven analysis. Focus 
was mainly on intergenic and antisense lncRNAs, 
which do not overlap protein-coding loci and that 
can be unambiguously quantified using RNA-Seq. 
Differential expression analysis revealed that 
140 lncRNA were significantly deregulated in HF 
vs. HD. Among them, 33 non-coding genes were up￾regulated and 107 were down-regulated (Fig. 3D; 
Table 4). As lncRNA may act to regulate gene 
expression of surrounding protein-coding genes, 
DE lncRNAs were associated, through an auto￾matic computational pipeline, with the transcrip￾tion start site of the nearest protein-coding gene. 
Of these, 27 (24 up- and 3 down-regulated) lncR￾NAs were DE (Table 4). Interestingly, among the 
most altered lncRNAs/gene and lincRNA/gene 
pairs we found EPHA5-AS1/EPHA5 and JAK1/
/RP11-182I10 genes, respectively. EPHA5-AS1 
is located on chromosome 4q13.2 and Ensembl 
annotates 3 different isoforms transcribed from 
this locus, with a long isoform composed of 
4 exons (1,177 nucleotide in length). Moreover, 
EPHA5-AS1 has a partial overlap with the 5’UTR 
of EPHA5 gene (Fig. 4A), suggesting a direct 
regulatory role of this antisense lncRNA on the 
sense protein-coding gene. To address whether 
a potential correlation may exist, normalized 
expression values of both the protein-coding 
and the lncRNA in all samples were compared. 
Interestingly, it was observed that both of them 
were significantly up-regulated in HF compared 
to HD (Fig. 4B), and the expression values had
a high positive correlation (Pearson’s coefficient 
= 0.89). Also similarly revealed, was a positive 
correlation between JAK1 and RP11-182I10, 
a lincRNA/mRNA transcribed in the same orien￾tation of JAK1 gene and was localized very close 
to this gene (Fig. 4C). Boxplots in Figure 4D 
show the expression values of both genes under 
two different conditions (FDR < 0.05).

RNA-Seq validation
To validate the results of the analysis between 
two conditions, qRT-PCR on the same RNAs used for 
RNA-Seq experiments were performed (Table S1).
Under analysis was the expression of several se￾lections of significantly altered genes, including 
all GO categories, comparing HF and HD groups 
(Tables S2–S5). Particularly, altered cytoskeletal 
components, closely involved in the regulation of the 
actin and myosin cytoskeleton and muscle contrac￾tion, included: ACTA2, ACTG2, NMUR1, MYL4, 
and MYH10. Moreover, the following transcription 
factors involved in heart development and morpho￾genesis were selected: TBX20, SHOX2, HOPX and 
MSX1. Furthermore, among significantly DEGs, 
the retinoic acid producing enzyme ALDH1A2 was 
chosen for validation. Finally, among genes encoding 
for ionic channels, we selected: SLC8A1, CHRNE, 
HCN2, BDKRB2, and CACNA1G.
All DEGs analyzed by qRT-PCR confirmed the 
expression trends obtained by RNA-Seq analysis. 
In Figure S3 (see journal website, supplemen￾tary file) observation revealed that FC measured 
by RNA-Seq (count per million [CPM]) was con￾firmed also by qRT-PCR (2–DDCt).

compared to healthy subjects. In particular, 
bioinformatic analysis revealed a significant 
alteration of “focal adhesion”, “regulation of 
actin cytoskeleton” and “oxidative phospho￾rylation” in HF cardiomyocytes;
2. The identification of some genes, which had 
not been previously reported, had an as￾sociation with human heart tissue and HF 
(ADAMTS8, ADAMTSL4, ACTA2, ACTG2 
and NMUR1);
3. The identification of a potential disease-spe￾cific signature, comparing gene expression 
levels in DCM and RCM groups, revealing 
as significantly DEGs, genes belonging to 
the “TNF signaling pathway”, “phagosome”, 
“cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction”;
4. The identification of altered levels of genes 
encoding 5 MED subunits that play a fun￾damental role in human HF. Among these, 
to date, MED17 has not yet been associated 
with CVD;
5. The identification of specific non-coding RNAs 
that potentially have a role in HF. Focusing 
mainly on intergenic and antisense lncRNAs, 
differential expression analysis revealed that 
EPHA5-AS1/EPHA5 and JAK1/RP11-182I10 
genes (a lncRNAs/gene and lincRNA/gene 
pairs respectively) were significantly deregu￾lated in HF vs. HD.

components have been found in both animal mod￾els of HF and in humans [37, 38]. Specifically, an 
increase in cytoskeletal proteins together with
a loss of contractile filaments has been suggested 
as the morphological cause of heart dysfunction 
[37, 38]. The number of genes involved in this 
structural disruption continues increasing; however, 
other cytoskeleton and contractile fiber genes are 
expected to play a role in these pathologies. As pre￾viously reported, most genes encoding components 
for a wide variety of cellular compartments and 
pathways, such as: contractile and transduction ap￾paratus, gene transcription and splicing machinery, 
and calcium regulation, were associated with DCM 
[11]. An example of altered genes, also deregulated 
in this condition and was represented by ACTC1, 
DSG2, MYH6, SGCD (Tables S2–S5). On the other 
hand, genetic mutations in familial RCM are not 
well defined, since there is significant overlap in 
the mutations between RCM, DCM, and HCM [12]. 
Also in RCM, accordingly to previous studies and 
presently identified genes encoding sarcomere (e.g. 
ACTC1, MYH7, and TNNT2), Z-disk proteins (e.g. 
MYPN), and intermediate filament network (e.g. 
DES) (Tables S2–S5). Interestingly, in the pres￾ent study, a large number of genes were identified 
that had not been previously correlated with HF. 
Although the specific GO category/term is strongly 
associated with this pathology, significantly altered 
genes were found associated to “myocardial infarc￾tion susceptibility” and “cardiomyopathy” only when 
down-modulated genes were considered. DEGs 
were also significantly enriched in “immune re￾sponse” and “inflammation-related” pathways. Fur￾thermore, other genes involved in “angiogenesis” 
and “cytoskeleton” were significantly altered in HF 
vs. HD as well as some genes with very important 
biochemical/biological functions in other tissues 
or organs (Table S6). The list of genes includes: 
ACTA2, NMUR1, ACTG2, KCNJ5, GATA6, MSX1, 
ZNF385B, ADAMTS8, ADAMTSL4 and COMP. In 
particular, ACTA2 and ACTG2 have been associated 
with HF for the first time in this study. Specifically, 
these genes were down-regulated both in DCM and 
RCM conditions. In the analysis of DCM and RCM 
vs. control group, ACTA2 gene reported a FC = –2.7 
and –3.3, respectively. This trend was also confirmed 
for ACTG2, with a FC = –8.2 and –7.5 in DCM and 
RCM, respectively. As previously reported, these 
genes encode highly conserved molecules belonging 
to the actin family proteins, involved in cell motility, 
structure and integrity of the contractile apparatus 
[39]. Noteworthy, NMUR1 gene is particularly 
down-regulated in HF (–3.78 fold; FDR < 0.05); 
this gene is endogenously expressed in adult rat 
cardiomyocytes, where it is involved in modulat￾ing L-type Ca(2+) channels [40]. Thus, this study 
suggests that the altered levels of NMUR1 may also 
play a significant role in human HF.
Generally, the findings of this study indi￾cate a more complex transcriptome alteration in 
RCM compared to DCM. Indeed, in DCM filtered 
list a total of 50 genes which were differentially 
expressed whereas RCM tissues displayed 516 
common DEGs. Nevertheless, despite the differ￾ent etiologies of DCM and RCM, it is conceivable 
that both pathologies can share similar functional 
changes that are responsible for HF. 
Moreover, bioinformatic functional analysis 
demonstrated that DEGs binding-related genes 
(1,892 up-regulated and 536 down-regulated genes) 
were differentially expressed in failing samples 
when compared with non-failing hearts (Fig. 2A). 
Interestingly, our analysis also revealed the 
differential expression of 5 genes encoding various 
subunits of the MED: MED12, MED13L, MED14, 
MED17, MED23 when a PP > 0.95 was used to 
determine DEGs (Fig. 1B; Table 3). To date, altera￾tions in MED complex genes have been associated 
with several human multifactorial diseases, includ￾ing CVDs [41–44]. To date, only MED17 has not 
yet been associated with CVD. All differentially 
expressed MED were up-regulated in HF patients. 
In particular, MED12 expression was found altered 
in DCM and RCM groups when we used a PP > 0.80.
Noteworthy, MED17 gene is up-regulated in RCM 
patients (+0.50 fold; FDR < 0.05); this gene con￾stitute a subunit of MED head module and interact 
with Pol II and the general transcription factors for 
both transcription and nucleotide excision repair 
mechanisms [45]. Thus, our pilot study suggests 
that the altered levels of MED subunits may play
a fundamental role in human HF. In particular, since 
that MED complex has been also shown to work in 
cooperation with ncRNAs in regulating gene tran￾scription [41], it would be relevant to investigate 
MED17 functions in order to understand its role in 
the onset and progression of RCM. 
To date, several reports indicate that other 
classes of RNAs, other than protein-coding, are 
potential contributors to human diseases [46, 47], 
mainly as they are able to regulate gene expression 
at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and epi￾genetic levels [48, 49]. Among these ncRNAs, the 
class of lncRNAs plays an important role in several 
conditions such as cancer, liver disease and central 
nervous system disorders among many others. 
Exploratory studies performed on the lncRNA in 
550 www.cardiologyjournal.org
Cardiology Journal 2017, Vol. 24, No. 5

the cardiovascular setting have thus far identified 
only few lncRNA associated with CVDs [50, 51]. 
Specific studies looking at lncRNAs in HF remain 
lacking [51]. 
To investigate whether lncRNAs may poten￾tially have a role in heart diseases, systematic 
analysis of RNA-Seq datasets to identify lncRNAs 
DE in HF was performed. Differential expression 
analysis revealed 140 significantly deregulated 
lncRNA in HF vs. HD. Among them, 24% of non￾coding genes were up-regulated and 76% were 
down-regulated. A searched for all the 140 DE 
lncRNAs the nearest protein-coding genes and 
we could find only 27 pairs of lncRNA-genes that 
are both differentially expressed was done. Of all,
27 genes (about 20%) were DE (Table 4). Interest￾ingly, among associated DE lncRNAs and protein 
coding genes, we found EPHA5-AS1 (annotated 
also as RP11-807H7.1), a lncRNA transcribed anti￾sense to EPHA5 gene. Both the protein-coding and 
the lncRNA are up-regulated in HF vs. HD (Fig. 4). 
Moreover, EPHA5-AS1 has a partial overlap with 
the 5’UTR of EPHA5 gene (Fig. 4), which suggests 
a direct regulatory role of this antisense lncRNA 
on the sense protein-coding gene. Ephrin recep￾tors have diverse activities, including widespread 
effects on the actin cytoskeleton, cell-substrate 
adhesion, intercellular junctions, cell shape, and 
cell movement [52]. However, this is the first 
report about its deregulation in cardiomyopathies.
Similarly, a positive correlation between JAK1 
and the lincRNA RP11-182I10 was observed. Differ￾ent from EPHA5-AS1, RP11-182I10 is transcribed 
on the same strand of JAK1 gene in a typical head￾to-tail orientation (Fig. 4C). The expression values 
of both genes under two different conditions were 
also increased (FDR < 0.05) (Fig. 4D). JAK1 gene 
encodes a protein-tyrosine kinase member, operat￾ing fundamental roles as the intracellular signaling 
effector of cytokine receptors. The activation and/or 
inactivation of members of the Janus kinase family 
are causally linked to different human diseases, as 
hemopoietic malignancies, immunodeficiency and 
inflammatory diseases [53]. However, EPHA5 and 
the JAK1 gene have never been identified as altered 
in patients with cardiomyopathies. These novel 
changes could be responsible for altered contrac￾tion and cell disruption in HF subjects, which may 
suggest novel therapeutic approaches.
Conclusions
The present findings revealed specific expres￾sion pattern of both protein-coding and lncRNAs 
in HF patients, confirming that new LV myocardial 
biomarkers could be reliably identified using Next￾Generation Sequencing-based approaches.
For patients awaiting heart transplantation, 
there are differences in survival on the basis of type 
of heart disease (DCM or RCM). The knowledge 
of an expression network signature in end-stage 
HF diseased hearts may offer important insights 
into the complex pathogenesis of advanced cardiac 
failure, it may also provide potential targets for 
therapeutic intervention.
All the novel changes revealed could be re￾sponsible for altered contraction and cell disruption 
in HF subjects. However, many of these factors, 
play critical roles in heart development and ho￾meostasis as well as in other human diseases, an 
original list of novel candidate genes with potential 
implications in HF is offered. These findings reveal 
a specific expression pattern of both protein-coding 
and lncRNAs in HF patients, confirming that new 
LV myocardial biomarkers can be reliably identified 
using NGS-based approaches. Interestingly, for 
many of these proteins; pharmacological agonists 
and antagonists could be developed, raising excit￾ing possibilities for new therapeutic approaches.
