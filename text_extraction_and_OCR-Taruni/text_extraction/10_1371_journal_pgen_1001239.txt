Abstract
Recent studies demonstrated a strong influence of rare genetic variants on several lipid-related traits. However, their impact
on free fatty acid (FFA) plasma concentrations, as well as the role of rare variants in a general population, has not yet been
thoroughly addressed. The adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) is encoded by the PNPLA2 gene and catalyzes the rate-limiting
step of lipolysis. It represents a prominent candidate gene affecting FFA concentrations. We therefore screened the full
genomic region of ATGL for mutations in 1,473 randomly selected individuals from the SAPHIR (Salzburg Atherosclerosis
Prevention program in subjects at High Individual Risk) Study using a combined Ecotilling and sequencing approach and
functionally investigated all detected protein variants by in-vitro studies. We observed 55 novel mostly rare genetic variants
in this general population sample. Biochemical evaluation of all non-synonymous variants demonstrated the presence of
several mutated but mostly still functional ATGL alleles with largely varying residual lipolytic activity. About one-quarter (3
out of 13) of the investigated variants presented a marked decrease or total loss of catalytic function. Genetic association
studies using both continuous and dichotomous approaches showed a shift towards lower plasma FFA concentrations for
rare variant carriers and an accumulation of variants in the lower 10%-quantile of the FFA distribution. However, the
generally rather small effects suggest either only a secondary role of rare ATGL variants on the FFA levels in the SAPHIR
population or a recessive action of ATGL variants. In contrast to these rather small effects, we describe here also the first
patient with ‘‘neutral lipid storage disease with myopathy’’ (NLSDM) with a point mutation in the catalytic dyad, but
otherwise intact protein.

Introduction
Despite immense efforts, the genetic contribution to many
complex phenotypes and diseases is still incompletely understood
[1]. Two opposite hypotheses about the nature of genetic variation
underlying common diseases have been proposed. The ‘‘common
disease – common variant’’ hypothesis argues that the genetic basis
of complex diseases is formed by the cumulative action of frequent
polymorphisms (here defined by a minor allele frequency (MAF)
.5%) with small impact [2], while the ‘‘common disease – rare
variant’’ hypothesis rather advocates a strong impact of rare
variants with large effects and high penetrance [3,4]. Genome￾wide association studies (GWAS) based on the former rationale led
to the identification of an impressive wealth of new loci and
pathways [5,6], but left a large fraction of the estimated heritability
still unexplained [7]. Since effects of rare variants are not captured
by conventional GWAS, they were discussed to be a major source
to explain this ‘‘missing heritability’’ [1,7–9].
Studies resequencing the coding regions of candidate genes for
example for lipoprotein metabolism [10–13], obesity [14], renal
function [15], type 1 diabetes [16] and cancer predisposition [17–
19] follow the rationale that mutations with large effects are likely
to be enriched in the extremes of the phenotype distribution
[8,10]. These studies detected several rare mutations and
underscored the power of the ‘‘extreme phenotype-approach’’ to
identify new functional variants and provide substantial insights
into the molecular function of genes [20–22]. However, the
influence of rare variants outside of phenotypic extremes and their
relevance in the general population has not yet been addressed in
depth. Some expectations about the effect size of rare variants may
PLoS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 1 December 2010 | Volume 6 | Issue 12 | e1001239

currently be too optimistic and rare variants with modest but still
detectable effects are likely to exist [23]. In addition, resequencing
studies so far focused on coding regions, neglecting promoter
regions and introns. Finally, recently resequenced genomes
revealed that current single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
databases are still far from being complete [24–29].
Rare genetic variants at a population level have not been
investigated for PNPLA2 (more commonly known as Adipose
Triglyceride Lipase, ATGL [MIM *609059]) which is a highly
interesting candidate gene in the lipolytic cascade. The protein
encoded by the ATGL/PNPLA2 gene catalyzes the rate-limiting
step of lipolysis, i.e. the breakdown of triacylglycerol to
diacylglycerol [30–32], and represents the main lipase for basal
and hormone stimulated lipolysis [33]. The human ATGL protein
consists of 504 amino acids divided into an N-terminal part
containing the catalytic patatin domain (amino acids 10 to 178)
and a more loosely defined regulatory C-terminus [34] (Figure 1).
The predicted catalytic dyad is formed by a serine residue at
position 47 and an aspartate residue at position 166 [33].
Moreover, a putative hydrophobic lipid binding domain at
positions 315–360 and two phosphorylation sites with unknown
function at Ser404 and Ser428 were described [30,35].
Two proteins are known to regulate ATGL activity in an
opposite manner. Interaction with ABHD5 (also known as CGI￾58, [MIM *604780]) enhances the catalytic activity up to 20-fold
in mice and still 4-fold in humans [36], while the G0/G1 switch 2
protein (G0S2; [no MIM number assigned]) inhibits ATGL activity
by interacting with the patatin domain, as described very recently
by Yang and colleagues [37]. Additionally, regulation by
nutritional status, insulin, PPARA (MIM +170998) and PPARG
(MIM *601487) was reported [38,39].
Mutations in ATGL and ABHD5 have provided the molecular
basis underlying neutral lipid storage disease (NLSD) in humans.
NLSD is a group of rare, autosomal recessive disorders character￾ized by excessive accumulation of trigylceride-containing cytoplas￾mic droplets in peripheral blood smears (referred to as Jordans’
anomaly) and other tissues of the body including skin, bone marrow,
muscles and cultured fibroblasts. Excessive lipid storage leads to
variable forms of clinical presentations including ichthyosis, skeletal
and cardiac myopathy and hepatic steatosis. Additionally, some
cases have been reported with ataxia, hearing loss, or mental
retardation. A recently proposed classification subdivides NLSD
into two distinct groups [40]. Depending on whether or not the
patients suffer from skin involvement, they are diagnosed with either
neutral lipid storage disease with ichthyosis (NLSDI, also known as
Chanarin Dorfman Syndrome [MIM #275630] or neutral lipid
storage disease with myopathy (NLSDM, [MIM #610717]),
respectively. Importantly, this classification finds its molecular basis

Author Summary
The nature of the genetic variation underlying common
traits is not yet completely understood. Recently, there has
been a shift in the genetic research focus towards the
elucidation of the influence of rare variants, which are
thought to exert a strong impact on common traits.
Circulating free fatty acids are immediate products of the
triglyceride breakdown and represent a yet poorly
addressed phenotype to study the impact of rare variants
on lipolysis. Since ATGL (encoded by the PNPLA2 gene)
controls the rate limiting step of lipolysis, we screened its
whole gene region in 1,473 healthy individuals and found
that 1 out of 13 individuals indeed carried at least one rare
mutation. Biochemical investigations showed that, even in
a healthy population, several missense variants lead to an
impaired catalytic activity and 1 variant even produced a
completely inactive protein. However, subsequent associ￾ation studies revealed only small effects on the free fatty
acids levels in the population. This suggests an only
secondary role of rare ATGL variants on free fatty acids
levels. More generally, we conclude that even in a healthy
population pronounced allelic heterogeneity due to the
presence of several rare variants may be common.
Effects of Rare Variants in ATGL on FFA Levels

in the affected genes. Mutations in ATGL cause NLSDM, and
mutations in ABHD5 cause NLSDI [41].
On the other hand, polymorphisms and haplotypes in ATGL
were associated with reduced plasma levels of free fatty acids (FFA)
and triglycerides, increased plasma levels of glucose and an
elevated risk for type 2 diabetes in the Utah Obesity Case-Control
Study [42]. Common haplotypes have also been associated with
increased triglycerides in Greenland Inuits [43]. However, no
association of rare variants with obesity was observed in a recent
case-control study [14].
The aim of this study was to thoroughly investigate the influence
of rare variants in the ATGL gene on FFA levels in a large healthy
working population both by association and biochemical studies.
This was achieved by (1) screening the genomic region of the ATGL
gene for novel variations, (2) in-vitro evaluation of residual
enzymatic activity and intracellular localization of all detected
protein variants and (3) genetic association studies on FFA levels. All
investigations were done in the SAPHIR population, which is an
observational study in healthy unrelated Caucasian subjects. Study
participants were recruited in the years 1999–2002 by health￾screening programs in large companies in and around the Austrian
city of Salzburg. For further details see the Methods section below.
Our study in a healthy population revealed a pronounced allelic
heterogeneity due to mostly rare and even private mutations with,
however, modest effects of FFA plasma concentrations.
Besides this screening approach and in order to oppose the
mutations found in heterozygote state in a healthy population to
an example of a homozygous state, we describe here also the first
patient with NLSDM caused by a point mutation within the
catalytic dyad (p.D166G).
Results
Mutation screening
We screened a total of 11.6 megabases for mutations
corresponding to the complete ATGL gene region in 1,473
individuals randomly selected from the SAPHIR Study. We
detected 20 rare and 34 private variants, but also one common
polymorphism, which were not yet reported in dbSNP build 131
(Table 1 and Figure 2). An exhaustive list is given in Table S1.
Taken together, rare variants in ATGL were present in 7.7% of the
screened individuals (n = 113).
Only about half of the SNPs stored in dbSNP for ATGL were
detected in our population. However, confirmation of 14 out of 17
independently validated SNPs corroborates the sensitivity of our
approach. The inspection of the database entries of the three
undetected validated SNPs revealed that two of them were
originally detected in samples of different ethnicity than SAPHIR
(rs12270408 in Blacks and rs28535188 in Asians) and the third one
(rs10544581) was located in a low complexity region.
Although representing a general healthy working population, 39
(2.6%) of the individuals presented rare missense and even
nonsense mutations in ATGL (Table 2). Most notably, we even
identified a heterozygous frameshift variation at aspartate 244,
which introduces a premature translation stop at amino acid 254
and thus produces a dysfunctional protein totally lacking lipid
droplet binding and catalytic activity (see below). Moreover, two
frequent non-synonymous SNPs were present in the population.
The mutation density was highest in the upstream region of
ATGL (1 every 71 bases) and similar in introns and coding regions
(1 every 132 and 115 bases, respectively) (Figure 2 and Table 1).
Strikingly, about three quarters of all detected variants in ATGL in
the present study were until recently unknown.
Functional studies of ATGL variants
We investigated the intracellular localization and in-vitro
triglyceride hydrolase activity of all detected protein variants
including the two frequent SNPs rs56152088 and rs1138693
(p.P265S and p.P481L, respectively). All mutants were readily
expressed by Cos-7 cells and, except for the frame shift mutation
p.D244fs, still correctly localized to the lipid droplets (Figures S1
and S2). In line with previous reports [34], the loss of the C￾terminus effectively abolished the binding of the truncated
p.D244fs protein to the lipid droplets (Figure 3).
Both basal and ABHD5-stimulated catalytic activities showed
large variability ranging from total inactivity (p.D244fs) over strong
impairment (p.R113H, p.V402I) to nearly wild type activity
(Figure 4). All mutants with residual activity were still stimulated
by ABHD5.
Identification of the first NLSDM patient with a point
mutation in the catalytic dyad
During our screening in the SAPHIR Study, a 20 year old male
was referred to our laboratory with the suspicion of NLSDM.
Clinical investigations had revealed a dilation of the right cardiac
ventricle with severely impaired function, diffuse cardiac fibrosis
and vacuolated neutrophiles. However, no ichthyosis was
observed. Cultured fibroblasts showed a 1.54-fold accumulation
of [9,10-3
H]-oleate, when compared to 5 healthy controls (516
6.661023 vs. 3365.561023 counts per mg protein/24 hours;
measurements done in quadruplicates).
In order to corroborate the NLSDM diagnosis, we included the
exons and splice sites of ATGL of the patient and both parents in our
mutation screening, revealing a homozygous c.497A.G mutation
(p.D166G) disrupting the catalytic dyad (Figure 1). Parents were
consanguineous and heterozygous for the mutation. Biochemical
investigations showed intact intracellular localization, but total loss
of catalytic activity (Figure 3 and Figure 4). This is the first proof of
the crucial importance of the aspartate 166 in humans, which was so
far only demonstrated by in vitro experiments in mice [35,41].

Effects of Rare Variants in ATGL on FFA Levels
PLoS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 3 December 2010 | Volume 6 | Issue 12 | e1001239

Conservation and bioinformatic prediction
Except for valine 402, all mutated amino acids were well
conserved in mammals, vertebrates and, partly, even in other
bilateria (Figure 4). The catalytic aspartate at position 166 was
conserved in all species from man to fruit fly and both asparagine
252 and arginine 113 were conserved in all but one species.
However, also several C-terminal variations affected positions
were rather conserved in mammals and vertebrates.
The performance of the bioinformatic prediction tools Poly￾phen-2, SIFT and PMUT was quite ambiguous (Figure 4,
bottom). They concordantly predicted a deleterious effect of the
N-terminal mutations p.R79Q, p.R113H and p.D166G, but all
failed to predict the strong activity decrease of p.V402I. The
predictions for the C-terminal variations were generally partially
inconclusive, probably due to the lower degree of conservation of
the C-terminus, its less well defined function and the rather small
impact of the variants on the protein function.
Genetic association studies
Finally, we aimed to evaluate the genetic association of rare
variants with FFA levels in the SAPHIR population using both a
continuous and an ‘‘extreme phenotype’’ approach. FFA levels
were available for a subgroup of 1253 individuals out of the 1473
individuals screened for variants. Figure S3 shows the distribution
and corresponding percentiles of the FFA levels. Effect estimates
from a linear model on log(FFA) for each of the rare variants
showed an accumulation of increased plasma levels for variants in
the promoter region (Figure S4). For the other classes of rare
variants the effect direction was rather inconclusive, suggesting a
rather heterogeneous effect of rare ATGL variants on the
population if present in heterozygous state. Overall, FFA levels

Effects of Rare Variants in ATGL on FFA Levels
PLoS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 4 December 2010 | Volume 6 | Issue 12 | e1001239

showed a slight shift towards lower FFA values for rare variant
carriers, which seemed to be primarily driven by the missense
variant p.N252K (p = 0.023) (Figure 5). No clear association of any
other missense variant was observed.
Next we assessed the impact of rare ATGL variants in the
phenotypic extremes, using the lower and upper 10%-quantiles of
FFA values. The conditional density plot (Figure 6) showed an excess
of rare variants in the lower tail of the FFA distribution. It indicates
that using the bottom and top 10% of the distribution provides a
good discrimination between individuals with at least one or no rare
variants without losing too many data and therefore information.
Fifteen rare variants (11.8%) were found in the group of low
FFA values compared to 7 (5.6%) in the group of high FFA values.
This difference in proportions was statistically significant
(p = 0.036; Beta-test [44]). Especially p.N252K and, surprisingly,
variants in the introns were contributing to this excess of rare
variants in the lower FFA quantile (Figure 7).
Table 3 gives a comparison of potential confounders between
the two tail groups. However, none of these parameters were
associated with both FFA levels and rare variants (data not shown),
therefore excluding confounder effects.
Discussion
Mutation screening in SAPHIR and functional evaluation
of missense variants
We investigated the influence of rare genetic variants in ATGL
on FFA levels by an unbiased approach in a healthy working
population by genetic association studies followed by functional
investigations. The biochemical characterization of the detected
missense variants demonstrated the presence of several mutated
but still operative alleles with largely varying residual activity even
in a healthy population. However, one variant showed a total loss
of function (p.D244fs) and three variants presented markedly
impaired catalytic activities (p.R79Q, p.R113H and p.V402I).
The effects of p.D244fs and p.V402I were against our
expectations. The p.D244fs variant represents the shortest human
nonsense mutation, which has been functionally investigated so far.
Unlike most previously described forms of truncated ATGL [34,35],
p.D244fs totally lacked catalytic activity, probably due to critical
changes in the overall protein structure produced by a frameshift in
the a/b hydrolase fold. A similar finding for a synthetic 178X
construct was recently described by Kobayashi et al. [45].
The distinct activity decrease of p.V402I was puzzling, since V402
is a C-terminal, non-conserved amino acid. However, most
neighboring amino acids appear to be highly conserved (Figure
S5), thus suggesting a still unknown regulatory role of this amino acid
stretch. Intriguingly, Duncan et al. recently reported the binding of
still unidentified proteins to the C-terminus of murine ATGL [35].
Genetic association studies
Our population-wide association studies on FFA levels in the
SAPHIR Study were rather inconclusive and showed mostly non￾significant trends towards lower FFA levels for rare variant carriers.
These trends were primarily driven by the p.N252K variant
(Figure 5). Heterozygous carriers of this variant showed a decrease
in mean FFA levels of 15% compared to the wild type (6.70 mg/dl
vs. 7.86 mg/dl). This is in line with previous results in the Utah
Obesity Case Control study, where we observed a decrease of about
12% [42]. Interestingly, p.N252K did not show a pronounced

scanning microscopy. This image shows the intracellular localization of the YFP-tagged ATGL mutants D166G and D244fs compared to the wild
type ATGL in Cos-7 cells loaded with 400 mM fat free BSA-complexed oleic acid to induce lipid droplets generation. Lipid droplets were stained using
BODIPY 558/568 C12. While the binding to the lipid droplets was still intact and well pronounced for the D166G mutation, the deletion of the C￾terminus in the frameshift mutant D244fs effectively abolished the binding of the protein to the lipid droplets. The merged image clearly shows a
diffuse YFP signal in the cytoplasm, which no longer co-localizes with the signal of the BODIPY-stained lipid droplets. The images for all assayed
mutants are provided in Figures S1 and S2.

decrease in enzyme activity, although it affects one of the best
conserved amino acids among all evaluated variants (Figure 4). This
suggests that the association of p.N252K with FFA levels may be
based on mechanisms other than the mere modification of the
catalytic activity. On the other hand, given the nearly wild type-like
residual activity and the lower conservation grade of the affected
amino acids, the lack of association of the more frequent variations
p.P265S and p.P481L seems well plausible.
Since no clear effect of rare variants on the whole population was
observed we next investigated the impact of rare variants in the
outer quantiles of the FFA distribution. This uncovered an excess of
rare variants in the lower 10%-quantile, which was to a large extend
driven by p.N252K. However, the accumulation of rare variants was
even more pronounced when considering all rare variant carriers,
due to a contribution of rare intronic variants (Figure 7). On the
other hand, no accumulation of other missense variants was seen.
Since enzyme variants were frequently shown to follow a recessive
model, the observed lack of significant associations of ATGL variants
with FFA levels may indicate possible recessive effects of missense
mutations in ATGL. This was also observed in NLSDM carriers [40].
Accordingly, even the heterozygote carrier of p.D244fs did not
present any abnormalities in FFA levels (Figure S4).
Patient with NLSDM due to a point mutation in the
catalytic dyad
NLSDM-causing mutations were frequently reported to be
located in the C-terminus, thus keeping intact the patatin domain
and the catalytic dyad [33]. Only two mutations in the patatin
domain have been described so far: a retrotransposon insertion into
exon 3 [46] and a frameshift mutation in exon 4 (p.Q160fs) [47,48].
The latter also causes a mutation of the active site D166, but
possible effects on enzyme inactivation were not investigated [33].
We describe the first patient with a point mutation of the catalytic
aspartate (p.D166G), which is sufficient to effectively abolish the
catalytic activity (Figure 4), despite of a still intact binding to the
lipid droplets (Figure 3). The seemingly well pronounced binding of
the D166G reminds to the recently reported p.P195L loss of function
mutation [40], which showed an slightly increased binding to lipid
droplets too [34], which might be caused by a decreased protein
turn-over rate. In line with previous reports [40,45,48], the patient
aged 19 presented a severe cardiomyopathy and is currently
awaiting a cardiac transplant. This confirms the potentially highly
deleterious effects of functionally impaired ATGL alleles.
Although both the muscles and the heart are not classical lipid
storage tissues, the observation of myopathy and cardiomyopathy is
in line with observations in ATGL-ko mice, which die from cardiac
insufficiency at about week 12 from birth and show reduced exercise
tolerance [33,49]. Recent studies have provided some insights in the
underlying mechanisms [33,49,50]. By using mice lacking ATGL in
all tissues except the cardiac muscle, Schoiswohl et al have
demonstrated a crucial role of ATGL for the supply of the working
muscle with fatty acids [50]. Conversely, the cardiomyopathy is
thought to be produced by a defect in the utilization of FFAs by the
cardiomyocytes [33]. The cardiac muscle is not able to autono￾mously synthesize fatty acids, but rather relies on the exogenous

supply from plasma. The uptaken FFAs are however not directly
utilized for b-oxidation, but first re-esterified to triglycerides, which,
in case of an ATGL deficiency, then accumulate in the cardiomy￾ocytes. This issue is further exacerbated by the fact that the FFA
uptake machinery still remains fully induced, despite the impaired
triglyceride breakdown [33]. This may then produce the observed
cardiac hypertrophy and subsequent cardiac failure.
Strengths and limitations of our study
The resequencing of individuals with extreme phenotypes has
been very successful to identify new functional variants and shed light
on the molecular function of involved proteins [20–22,51]. However
the total impact of rare variants on traits in healthy populations is still
unclear. The rare variant hypothesis has been repeatedly invoked to
explain at least partially the missing heritability issue [1,7–9], and
postulates a high allelic heterogeneity consisting of individually rare
but collectively common rare variants [3]. However, the well
established impact of rare variants on the tails of the phenotypic
distribution alone may not sufficiently explain a considerable portion
of heritability and current expectation might be too optimistic [23].
Therefore, besides the highly deleterious rare variants in the outmost
tails, also a number of rare variants with modest but still detectable
effects should exist. These effects may, however, not be strong
enough to drive their carriers into the outmost tails of the
distribution, but rather contribute to the overall genetic distribution.
The main strengths of our study are (1) the unbiased approach
based on a large healthy working population, (2) the functional
follow-up of all detected missense variants, and (3) the statistical
evaluation using both on a continuous and dichotomous approach.
Only a few similar studies have been carried out before [13,15,20],
and none has so far evaluated also intronic and promoter variants.
However, since a healthy population rather reflects the general
variability in the population and will likely not be enriched for
functional variants, the size of our screening population could be
considered a limitation of our study, as it bears the risk of
underestimating the role of rare variants due to insufficient
statistical power. Due to lack of power, statistical tests were not
corrected for multiple testing. Thus, the association results
presented can merely be seen as a trend, which has to be followed
in further, even larger studies.
Finally, since coding mutations are most prone to exert a severe
impact on the protein function, we restricted the functional
evaluation only to coding variants, providing the so far largest
catalog of functionally investigated ATGL variants. However, the
additional exhaustive investigation of all non-coding variants
detected was beyond the scope of this study. Nevertheless, we are
well aware that also non-coding variants can exhibit strong
influence the phenotype [52]. Therefore, we cannot definitely rule
out the presence of unidentified regulatory variants.
Conclusions
Although ATGL represents a crucial player in the lipolysis
cascade, the role of rare genetic variants in ATGL remains elusive.
We found several rare genetic variants and observed a trend
Figure 5. Boxplots on log(FFA) for different classes of rare variants. The figure shows the free fatty acid (FFA) distribution of the carriers of
different subgroups of rare variants (all rare variant carriers, carriers of rare non-synonymous mutations, carriers of p.N252K, carriers of variants of rare
promoter SNPs (defined as SNPs upstream of ATGL or within the predicted promoters structures in intron 1, see also Figure 2) and carriers of rare
intronic SNPs) compared to individuals without rare variants (labeled with ’’none‘‘). Variants in ATGL showed a tendency towards lower FFA levels,
which was most pronounced for the p.N252K group. Conversely, a tendency towards higher FFA levels was observed for variants in the putative
promoter region. Estimates and p-values were calculated by linear regression on the logarithmized FFA levels (expressed as mg/dl).

towards lower FFA levels in carriers, as wells as an accumulation of
rare variants in the lower 10%-quantile of FFA levels. However,
the effects were rather small and suggested a secondary role of rare
ATGL variants on the FFA levels in a healthy population.
Our study demonstrates that even in a healthy population, rare
variants are collectively common and provide a large amount of
allelic heterogeneity. However, at least in our study, their role on a
quantitative trait in a healthy population outside of phenotypic
extremes was rather small. Whether this implies that the impact of
rare variants is, more generally, limited to the outer percentiles of
the phenotypic distribution of a quantitative trait, remains to be
investigated in further studies.
Methods
SAPHIR population
SAPHIR (Salzburg Atherosclerosis Prevention program in
subjects at High Individual Risk) is an observational study
involving 643 females aged 50 to 70 years and 1083 males aged
40–60 recruited between 1999 and 2002 in large companies in and
around the Austrian city of Salzburg [53]. The differential age
range between the sexes was chosen to match the cardiovascular
risk, which is lower for women but matches the risk of men aged
10 years plus. All subjects were unrelated and of Caucasian origin.
Exclusion criteria were severe obesity (BMI .40 kg/m2
),
established coronary artery, cerebrovascular or peripheral arterial
disease, congestive heart failure, valvular heart disease, chronic
alcohol (more than three drinks/day) or drug abuse and
pregnancy. At baseline, a detailed personal and family history of
all study participants was assessed via standardized questionnaires
and anthropometric parameters were measured in the course of a
physical examination. Venous blood was collected after an
overnight fast and plasma samples were either used immediately
for analysis or were stored frozen at 280uC. Plasma FFA
concentrations were measured by using a colorimetric assay
(Wako, USA) and DNA was extracted from total blood using the
Invisorb Blood Universal Kit (Invitek, Germany). Informed
consent was obtained from each participant and the study was
carried out in accordance with the local ethics committee.
Patient with NLSDM due to a point mutation in the
catalytic dyad
A 19-year-old male of consanguineous South Asian parents, who
was previously well and has no significant family history apart from
an older sister who died of an unknown cardiac problem at the age
of 9 (no post-mortem was carried out) presented to his local
Accident and Emergency Department with acute episode of
shortness of breath and generally unwell. He was subsequently
admitted under the care of cardiology team for further investiga￾tions. He had normal developmental milestones, was not on any
medications and was due to enroll first year third level education.
On admission, he had normal heart rate and blood pressure, his
body mass index was below 25 kg/m2. Routine blood tests
including full blood count, renal, bone profiles and creatinine

essentially normal apart from mildly raised c-glutamyl transferase
(GGT) suggestive of mild fatty liver which was confirmed on a liver
ultrasound. No ischaemic changes were noted on 12-lead
electrocardiogram (ECG). An echocardiogram showed severely
dilated both ventricles with left ventricle end-diastolic diameter of
72 mm (normal ,4964 mm) and ejection fraction of 14% (normal
.5867%). He denied any musculo-skeletal symptoms and no
history of ichthyosis was reported in the patient or the family.
He subsequently developed weakness of his left arm associated
with impaired co-ordination, and brain magnetic resonance
imaging showed a small cardio-embolic infarct in the right
parietal and cerebellum areas. 24 hr electrocardiogram showed
episodes of non-sustained broad complex tachycardia and multiple

ventricular ectopics. He was subsequently warfarinised and has
had implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and cardiac
resynchronization therapy (CRT) inserted, and being placed on
cardiac transplant waiting-list. General metabolic and autoim￾mune screenings for cardiomyopathy were negative apart from
Jordan’s anomaly observed on peripheral blood smear histology,
suggestive of a neutral lipid storage disorder.
Detection of genetic variants
Mutation screening was performed using the Ecotilling
technology. Ecotilling is a mutation detection technology based
on mismatch cleavage and enables sensitive high throughput
detection of rare mutations in 1.5 kb large PCR fragments and up
to 768 pooled samples per run [54]. It therefore dramatically
lowers the costs for rare variant screening in large populations by
introducing a cost-effective and robust prescreening step capable
of both detecting and exactly localizing several mutations per
amplicon and therefore significantly easing the subsequent follow￾up steps. Moreover, the intrinsic double detection of each
mutation ensures high specificity [54]. A flowchart detailing the
Ecotilling process is provided in Figure S6. Briefly, Ecotilling
screening was performed as described before with minor
modifications [54] and using fourfold pooled DNA. The genomic
region of ATGL (1506 bp before exon 1 to 106 bp after end of
exon 10) was amplified in 8 overlapping PCRs using LI-COR
IRDye labeled primers (Metabion GmbH, Germany). After
heteroduplex formation (99uC for 10 min, 70 cycles: 70uC for
20 s, decreasing 0.3uC per cycle), 4 ml PCR product were
incubated at 45uC with 1.5 ml reaction buffer (1 M MgSO4,
0.1 M HEPES pH 7.0, 0.1 M KCl, 0.02% Triton X-100, 2 mg/
ml BSA), 0.1 ml purified Cel-I (diluted 1:10,000) and 9.4 ml PCR
grade water (Lonza, Belgium). The digestion was stopped with 5 ml
75 mM EDTA, purified by Sephadex G50 (GE Healthcare,
Sweden), mixed with 5 ml of formamide loading buffer and
reduced to approximately 1.5 ml at 85uC. 0.8 ml were then loaded
on the LI-COR 4300 DNA Analyzer (LI-COR Biosciences, USA).
The assay design and evaluation approach was described in detail
earlier [55]. For primer sequences and PCR conditions see Tables
S2, S3, S4, S5. The Ecotilling approach was applied in 1473
randomly selected individuals from the SAPHIR Study.
Each rare mutation was then confirmed in each affected sample
by sequencing. Common SNPs present in multiple samples were
confirmed in at least one sample to ensure the identity of the
respective Ecotilling signal. Sequencing was performed using on
an Applied Biosystems (ABI) 3130xl Genetic Analyzer the BigDye
Terminator v1.1 cycle sequencing kit (ABI Applied Biosystems,
USA) using a modified protocol. For details see Tables S4 and S5.
Genotyping of rs56152088 (p.P265S) and rs1138693 (p.P481L) in
the entire population was performed with an ABI 7900HT Fast
Real-Time PCR System using ABI Taqman assays.
Site-directed mutagenesis
Point mutations were inserted into the eukaryotic expression
vector pEYFP-C1 (BD Biosciences Clontech, USA) encoding the
sequence of human ATGL and a yellow-green fluorescent protein
(YFP) [34] using the Invitrogen GeneTailor Site-Directed
Mutagenesis System. Fidelity of picked clones was verified by
restriction enzyme digestion and bidirectional sequencing. PCR
conditions and primer sequences are given in Tables S6, S7, S8.
Expression of human ATGL mutant proteins
Expression of recombinant YFP-ATGL proteins and controls
(wild type ATGL and b-galactosidase (LacZ)) was performed in
Cos-7 cells (ATCC CRL-1651; ATCC, USA). Cos-7 cells were
cultured at 37uC, 7.5% CO2 and 95% humidity in standard
growth medium consisting of Dulbecco’s Eagle modified medium
(GIBCO, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, (Sigma,
USA), 100 mg/ml Streptomycin and 100 U/ml Penicillin
(GIBCO). For transfection, cells were seeded at a density of
9*105 cells/10 cm2 dish, cultured in standard growth medium for
24 hours and transfected in serum-free medium with 6 mg plasmid
DNA using Metafectene (Biontex, Germany).
Isolation of cytoplasmatic extracts for triglyceride
hydrolase assay
After 48 hours in regular growth medium, cells were collected in
PBS buffer, pelleted at 290 g for 3 minutes and resuspended in assay
buffer (0.25 M sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 20 mg/ml
leupetine, 2 mg/ml antipain, 1 mg/ml pepstatin, pH 7.0). All further
steps were performed on ice. To generate cytoplasmatic extracts, cells
were disrupted by sonication (Sonicator 4000 with Microtip Probe,
Qsonica LLC, USA) and centrifugated at 1000 g (5 min, 4uC). Total
protein concentration was determined by a colorimetric assay
(Protein Assay, Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA) with BSA as standard.
Western blot analysis
The expression levels were determined by Western blotting
using 20 mg cytoplasmatic extract, a rabbit anti-GFP antibody
(1:5,000) (Abcam, USA) and a goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody
conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000) (Vector Labo￾ratories, USA). Chemoluminescence was induced using the GE
Amersham ECL Plus Kit and detected with a Typhoon 9400
Imager (GE Healthcare). Relative expression rates were deter￾mined with the ImageQuant Software 5.2 (GE Healthcare) using
the local median method for background correction (Figure S7).
To exclude the saturation of the gel bands, which might affect
correct quantification, amounts from 9 to 50 mg protein extract of
the lysate with the highest expression levels (p.V402I) were blotted
without reaching signal saturation (data not shown).
Triglyceride hydrolase assay
Triglyceride hydrolase activity was determined as the amount of
FFA released by 15 mg cytoplasmatic extract from a radiolabeled
substrate containing [9,10-3
H]-triolein in 1 hour [34,56]. The wild
type protein and each mutant were tested for basal and ABHD5
stimulated activity. Determination of ABHD5 stimulated activity
was measured by adding purified murine GST-ABHD5 [36]. The
concentration of ABHD5 leading to maximal stimulation of
ATGL was determined before. All measurements were done in
triplicates and corrected for Cos-7 background activity and
varying expression levels (see Figure S7).
Intracellular localization
Cos-7 cells were seeded on microscope slides in six well plates at
a density of 1.5*105 cells/well and transfected with 1 mg DNA per
well. 24 hours after transfection, cells were incubated for 20 hours
with regular growth medium containing 400 mM fat free BSA￾complexed oleic acid to induce lipid droplet generation. Lipid
droplets were finally stained by incubating the cells with 1 mg/ml
Bodipy 558/568 C12 (Invitrogen, USA) for 1 hour. The
localization of the YFP-tagged ATGL mutants was determined
by laser scanning microscopy using a Leica SP5 confocal
microscope (Leica Microsystems, Germany). YFP fluorescence
was excited at 514 nm and emission was detected between 520
and 540 nm. BODIPY 558/568 C12 was excited at 561 nm and
detected between 565–600 nm (Figures S1 and S2. Selected
mutants are shown in Figure 3).

Lipid accumulation in p.D166G fibroblasts of the patient
with NLSDM
Cultured fibroblasts were incubated as monolayers in multi-well
plates in Kreb’s ringer pH 7.0, 220 mmol/L [9,10-3H]oleic acid
complexed to a-cyclodextrin (25mg/ml) for 5 hours at 37uC. The
supernatant was removed, cells were washed in phosphate
buffered saline and digested with 1N sodium hydroxide. Total
accumulated tritium counts in the incubated cell digests were
measured by liquid scintillation counting in patient and simulta￾neous normal controls and expressed in relation to fibroblast
protein.
Statistical and bioinformatic analysis
For each of the variants, linear regression was performed on the
logarithmized FFA values. To strengthen the power of the analysis
including rare variants, they were grouped into carriers of rare
variants (‘‘all rare variants’’) and non-carriers. This group was refined
to several subgroups, including carriers of non-synonymous variants,
variants in the promoter region, intronic variants and carriers of
p.N252K. To follow the hypothesis that rare variants contribute to
the ‘‘extremes’’ of a phenotype, FFA values were a priori categorized
into their lower and upper 10% quantiles. The choice of this cutpoint
was evaluated by a conditional density plot showing the probability of
rare variants conditional on FFA values (Figure 6).
Proportion differences of rare variants between these extreme
groups of FFA were tested using the Beta-Test proposed by Li et al
[44].
All amino acid mutations were submitted to Polyphen-2 using the
HumDiv dataset [57], SIFT [58] and PMUT [59]. Evaluation of
non-coding SNPs was carried out as described before [60]. Promoter
prediction was done with the GenomatixSuite PE (Genomatix
GmbH, Germany). Conservation was evaluated using ClustalW [61]
on the Uniprot Homepage (http://www.uniprot.org). Accession
numbers of the sequences used are given in Table S9.

the cytoplasm, which no longer co-localizes with the signal of the
Bodipy-stained lipid droplets. All other missense variants were
however still able to correctly bind to the lipid droplets.

Figure S6 Description of the Ecotilling process. STEP 1: The
gDNA is normalized to 20 ng and arrayed on 96 well plates. STEP
2: Every four plates are pooled and normalized to 10 ng. STEP 3:
The pooled DNA is used as a template for PCR amplification of
the region of interest, employing primers labeled with IRDye 700
for the forward primer (red star), respectively the IRDye 800 for
the reverse primer (blue star). STEP 4: The PCR fragments are
heat-denatured and slowly renatured in order to allow the
formation of heteroduplexes of double-stranded DNA from
different individuals. In case that a SNP is present in this
fragment, a subpopulation of double-strands will contain a
mismatch, which will be cut by the Cel-I endonuclease in the
next step. The amplification products are then partially digested
with the endonuclease Cel-I which recongises DNA mismatches
with high specificity and cuts on their 39 end. This produces for
each mismatch (respectively SNP) two digestion fragments of
complementary length and with different labels on their 39 end.
STEP 5: The digestion products are size-fractionized using in a
denaturing PAGE and both wavelengths are detected simulta￾neously. Each SNP produces two additional bands, besides the
signal of the undigested full-size product, whose length sums up to
the length of the full-size product. Each SNP is doubly detected
and therefore quality controlled.
