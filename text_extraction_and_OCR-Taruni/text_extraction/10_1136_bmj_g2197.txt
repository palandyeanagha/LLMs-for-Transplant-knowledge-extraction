Abstract
Objectives To determine the effect on mortality of selective digestive
decontamination, selective oropharyngeal decontamination, and topical
oropharyngeal chlorhexidine in adult patients in general intensive care
units and to compare these interventions with each other in a network
meta-analysis.
Design Systematic review, conventional meta-analysis, and network
meta-analysis. Medline, Embase, and CENTRAL were searched to
December 2012. Previous meta-analyses, conference abstracts, and
key journals were also searched. We used pairwise meta-analyses to
estimate direct evidence from intervention-control trials and a network
meta-analysis within a Bayesian framework to combine direct and indirect
evidence.
Inclusion criteria Prospective randomised controlled trials that recruited
adult patients in general intensive care units and studied selective
digestive decontamination, selective oropharyngeal decontamination,
or oropharyngeal chlorhexidine compared with standard care or placebo.
Results Selective digestive decontamination had a favourable effect on
mortality, with a direct evidence odds ratio of 0.73 (95% confidence
interval 0.64 to 0.84). The direct evidence odds ratio for selective
oropharyngeal decontamination was 0.85 (0.74 to 0.97). Chlorhexidine
was associated with increased mortality (odds ratio 1.25, 1.05 to 1.50).
When each intervention was compared with the other, both selective
digestive decontamination and selective oropharyngeal decontamination
were superior to chlorhexidine. The difference between selective
digestive decontamination and selective oropharyngeal decontamination
was uncertain.
Conclusion Selective digestive decontamination has a favourable effect
on mortality in adult patients in general intensive care units. In these
patients, the effect of selective oropharyngeal decontamination is less
certain. Both selective digestive decontamination and selective
oropharyngeal decontamination are superior to chlorhexidine, and there
is a possibility that chlorhexidine is associated with increased mortality.
Introduction
The bacterial ecology of the oropharynx of patients in intensive
care units undergoes substantial alteration.1 2 This can lead to
ventilator associated pneumonia, other infections, and death. In
an attempt to reduce the incidence of these complications,
approaches to decontamination include various forms of
antibiotic prophylaxis or the use of topical oropharyngeal
antiseptic agents (mostly chlorhexidine). Antibiotic prophylaxis
can include any combination of oropharyngeal, intragastric, and
intravenous antibiotics. There are, however, two main
approaches: selective digestive decontamination (SDD) and
selective oropharyngeal decontamination (SOD).
Selective digestive decontamination consists of oropharyngeal
and gastric application of non-absorbable antibiotics—often
polymyxin, tobramycin, and amphotericin—along with a short
course of an intravenous antibiotic, often cefotaxime.
Oropharyngeal antibiotics are applied as a paste, usually four
times a day, during routine mouth care; gastric antibiotics are
administered as a suspension through a nasogastric tube.
Surveillance bacteriology, often twice a week, can be used to
assess efficacy of decontamination. The choice of therapeutic
antibiotics aims to minimise interference with the native
anaerobic flora by avoiding agents such as broad spectrum
penicillins. Selective oropharyngeal decontamination is the
application of the topical antibiotic paste to the oropharynx only,

without enteral or empirical intravenous antibiotics.3
Chlorhexidine is applied as part of routine mouth care in gel or
liquid form up to four times a day.
There has been considerable debate about the role of antibiotic
prophylaxis,4-6 and antibiotic prophylaxis is seldom used in the
United Kingdom.7 Topical oropharyngeal antiseptic agents
(usually chlorhexidine) have, by contrast, gained more
widespread acceptance and appear as a key recommendation in
UK,8 European,9
and US10 guidelines. Nevertheless, interest in
this topic remains current.11
Numerous meta-analyses of antibiotic and antiseptic prophylaxis
have been published over the years. A 2009 Cochrane review
suggested that mortality was significantly reduced by selective
digestive decontamination.12 Another review and meta-analysis
from 2007 concluded that mortality was unaffected by
oropharyngeal antibiotic or antiseptic decontamination.13 More
recent meta-analyses of oropharyngeal antiseptics (mostly
chlorhexidine) have focused on the incidence of ventilator
associated pneumonia,14-16 although some meta-analyses of
oropharyngeal chlorhexidine have reported a trend towards
increased mortality.15 17
Despite the favourable results seen in meta-analyses of selective
digestive decontamination, interpretation should be tempered
by the use of standard care as a control group in the contributory
trials. Given the likely widespread use of chlorhexidine, any
putative mortality advantage of selective digestive
decontamination or selective oropharyngeal decontamination
needs to be re-defined. As we are not aware of any clinical trials
directly comparing selective digestive decontamination or
selective oropharyngeal decontamination with topical
chlorhexidine, we aimed to use a network meta-analysis to
compare the effect of these interventions on mortality. This
required us to undertake an updated systematic review looking
for randomised controlled trials reporting the effect of selective
digestive decontamination, selective oropharyngeal
decontamination, and topical chlorhexidine on mortality in adult
patients in general intensive care units. We also wanted to update
conventional intervention-control meta-analyses of the three
interventions in light of any recent studies. We elected not to
study the outcome of ventilator associated pneumonia as we
consider mortality to be the most robust outcome, and this was
the focus of recent large trials of selective digestive
decontamination.18 19
Method
Sources of data
We searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Register of
Clinical Trials from 1984 until December 2012. We constructed
a search strategy around patients in intensive care, intervention
with antibiotic or antiseptic prophylaxis, and the outcome of
death. The Medline search strategy is shown in the appendix
and similar strategies were applied to the Embase and
CENTRAL databases. There were no language restrictions. We
screened results of the database searches by title and abstract.
Given the extent of previous systematic reviews, we reviewed
recent meta-analyses (published from 2005 to 201212-16 20-28) for
included studies that were missed in database searches. Congress
abstracts were searched from 2005 to 2012 for the European
Society for Intensive Care Medicine, Society for Critical Care
Medicine, Symposium of Intensive Care and Emergency
Medicine, and Chest. The contents pages of the journals
Intensive Care Medicine, Critical Care Medicine, Chest, Critical
Care, American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care
Medicine, Journal of Hospital Infection, and Infection Control
and Hospital Epidemiology were reviewed from January 2005
to December 2012. The website controlled-trials.com was used
to search registers of clinical trials. We did not search for
unpublished studies or contact experts in the field. We wrote to
authors if indicated.
Inclusion criteria
We sought prospective randomised controlled clinical trials in
adult patients in general intensive care units. We did not stipulate
placebo control or blinding. We defined “selective digestive
decontamination” as the application of a combination of poorly
absorbable antibiotics to the oropharynx and the stomach
combined with empirical intravenous antibiotics. “Selective
oropharyngeal decontamination” was defined as the application
of a combination of poorly absorbable antibiotics only to the
oropharynx. “Chlorhexidine” was defined as the application of
any concentration of chlorhexidine in any formulation to the
oropharynx. The control group must have received only standard
care or placebo.
Exclusion criteria
We excluded trials that recruited only children, populations not
in intensive care, and specialised populations (such as cardiac
surgery and liver transplantation). We excluded trials in which
both groups received active topical drugs or in which the control
group received empirical intravenous antibiotics. Finally we
excluded studies combining oropharyngeal and gastric
application of antibiotics or gastric or subglottic application
alone from the selective oropharyngeal decontamination
meta-analysis.
Quality assessment
We summarised potential biases with the Cochrane risk of bias
tool. There are six domains: sequence generation; allocation
concealment; blinding; if the outcomes reported were
prespecified; completeness of outcome data; and other potential
sources of bias. We have also presented information on each
study to show potential issues of clinical heterogeneity.
Data extraction
Results were extracted from the included studies, from our own
communication with authors, or from previous meta-analyses
if intention to treat data had been verified with the original study
authors.
Consensus
Two authors (RP, JG) independently performed study inclusion,
data extraction, and quality assessment. Disagreement at the
stage of abstract screening was resolved by inclusion of the full
paper for review. Disagreement at later stages was resolved by
discussion. Our approaches to studies with a three arm design
are presented in the appendix.
Statistical methods
Intervention-control pairwise meta-analyses
We summarised data from each study with log odds ratios and
95% confidence intervals. This approach was used to allow the
inclusion of the study by de Smet and colleagues,19 which used
a cluster randomised crossover design analysed by the authors
using multilevel logistic regression. We used the log odds ratios
and standard errors that de Smet and colleagues19 reported and
calculated the log odds ratios and standard errors for the
remaining studies based on the reported events and sample sizes.

Forest plots are included as a visual aid to interpret the direct
evidence. Pairwise meta-analyses were done in Review Manager
(RevMan), version 5.0 (Cochrane Collaboration, 2008).
Network meta-analysis
We used a generalised linear modelling framework as outlined
in Dias and colleagues29 to do a network meta-analysis. A “trial
level” approach was used, in which the data modelled were the
summary log odds ratios and standard errors for each trial as
outlined above. All model parameters were estimated within a
Bayesian framework with WinBUGS software.30 We present
estimates of treatment effects as odds ratios and 95% central
credible intervals (CrI). The credible interval shows the degree
of uncertainty around estimated treatment effects.
We also calculated individual estimates of the probability of
death for each intervention. These estimates were derived from
the model by using a baseline distribution for the probability of
death in the control group, in combination with the odds ratio
between each intervention and control. Vague prior distributions
were used on the necessary parameters: the log odds ratios of
intervention procedures versus control and the standard deviation
between studies. A run-in period of 50 000 iterations was
adequate to achieve convergence, and a further 100 000 samples
were taken.
Results
Systematic review
We identified 29 studies as suitable for inclusion18 19 31-57 (figure
1⇓). Tables 1-3⇓⇓⇓ show the components of the Cochrane risk
of bias tool for each intervention. Tables 4-6⇓⇓⇓⇓ show areas
of potential clinical heterogeneity between the studies and our
data source. Raw outcome data are presented in table A in the
appendix.
Intervention-control pairwise meta-analyses
The random effects estimate for selective digestive
decontamination compared with control on mortality gave an
odds ratio of 0.73 (95% confidence interval 0.64 to 0.84),
favouring selective digestive decontamination (fig 2⇓). For
selective oropharyngeal decontamination and chlorhexidine the
odds ratios were 0.85 (0.74 to 0.97) and 1.25 (1.05 to 1.50),
respectively (figs 3⇓ and 4⇓). The only direct evidence for
selective digestive decontamination compared with selective
oropharyngeal decontamination was from a single trial,19 which
gave an odds ratio of 0.97 (0.79 to 1.18). Results are summarised
in table 7⇓.
Results of network meta-analyses
The odds ratios (95% credible interval) for mortality for active
treatment compared with control were 0.74 (0.63 to 0.86) for
selective digestive decontamination, 0.82 (0.62 to 1.02) for
selective oropharyngeal decontamination, and 1.23 (0.99 to
1.49) for chlorhexidine (table 7⇓). For the comparison between
treatments, the odds ratios were 0.61 (0.47 to 0.78) for selective
digestive decontamination compared with chlorhexidine and
0.67 (0.48 to 0.91) for selective oropharyngeal decontamination
compared with chlorhexidine. There was uncertainty around
the difference between selective digestive decontamination and
selective oropharyngeal decontamination. Table 8 shows
probabilistic ranking of interventions⇓.
Discussion
Using a network meta-analysis to compare each intervention
indirectly, we conclude that both selective digestive
decontamination and selective oropharyngeal decontamination
are superior to chlorhexidine in preventing death in adults in
intensive care. This suggests that the mortality advantage of
both these options remains relevant even if chlorhexidine is
widely used. Any difference between these treatments is
inconclusive, with considerable uncertainty.
Our finding that selective digestive decontamination is
associated with a survival benefit in adults in general intensive
care units agrees with the conclusions of earlier meta-analyses,
but we have now integrated the results of a large cluster
randomised crossover trial. Results were similar with both
conventional and Bayesian analysis. Selective oropharyngeal
decontamination was associated with a reduction in death in the
meta-analysis of direct evidence. Contrary to our expectations,
use of oropharyngeal chlorhexidine was associated with an
increase in mortality in adults in general intensive care units.
Limitations of our study
Despite our inclusion criteria, our results are limited by the
inevitable heterogeneity among the included studies (tables
4-6⇓⇓⇓), with some common themes.
Within the chlorhexidine studies, the concentration of
chlorhexidine used varied from 0.12% to 2% and the number
of daily applications varied from one to four. In addition, the
duration of the course of treatment varied and in one study was
limited to seven days.54
Within the selective digestive decontamination studies, most
were not blinded and were not placebo controlled. Of those that
were blinded,36 38 39 only one explicitly reported concealment of
microbial culture results.39 We consider that this lack of blinding
would have had the least influence on the robust outcome of
mortality. We could not find any suggestion of differential
treatment of patients in the active treatment group over control
patients, although we cannot entirely exclude it. Infected patients
were excluded in three studies.34 37 38 There was some variability
in the exact antimicrobial regimen used; the influence of
different regimens has previously been discussed58 and has been
shown to influence at least infective outcomes.42 Two studies
differed slightly in their protocols by locally decontaminating
blind bowel loops and tracheal stomas and by treating persistent
tracheal colonisation with aerosolised polymyxin or
amphotericin.18 19
For each included selective digestive decontamination study,
the total proportion of patients in the intensive care unit that
were included in the trial was generally unclear. The only
included study to use a whole unit approach18 showed a mortality
benefit that was greater than that seen in meta-analyses (although
problems with this study have been highlighted.)59 60 Thus the
generalisability of these studies to a unit where selective
digestive decontamination or selective oropharyngeal
decontamination is applied to every patient needs to be
considered as selective digestive decontamination can alter the
ecology of the unit.32 61 62
When we considered all studies, there was variability in the
minimum predicted ventilator time or stay in the intensive care
unit. The proportion of ventilated patients varied from 36% in
one study55 to 100%.
A network meta-analysis rests on the comparability of a common
control group. Given the temporal variation (year of publication
ranging from 1989 to 2011) and wide geographic representation

(tables 4-6⇓⇓⇓), there is probably variation among the control
groups of the included studies. Control group treatments were
generally poorly detailed, although we have identified some
variation—for example, the use of topical bicarbonate48 50 or
potassium permanganate.55 When other control group treatments
were described, they were generally limited to the use of gastric
ulcer protection or non-pharmacological mouth care strategies.
When we considered the effect of chlorhexidine on mortality,
mortality was not the primary outcome of any of the included
studies and a significant increase in mortality was seen in only
one54 of the 11 studies. Additionally, we are aware of one further
study63 of the use of oropharyngeal chlorhexidine that could
have fulfilled our inclusion criteria, but we were unable to
include it as we could not obtain mortality data.
Implications of this study
In adult patients in general intensive care units, and within the
limits of a network meta-analysis, we propose that both selective
digestive decontamination and selective oropharyngeal
decontamination are superior to chlorhexidine. In keeping with
results of earlier studies, we have shown that selective digestive
decontamination is associated with reduced mortality. We raise
the possibility that oropharyngeal chlorhexidine might be
associated with an increase in mortality, and we therefore
question whether oropharyngeal chlorhexidine is “safe and
effective.”11 Certainly our findings are at odds with the
apparently favourable effects of chlorhexidine on the incidence
of ventilator associated pneumonia,14-16 although the attributable
mortality of this might be small.64 We consider that the role of
oropharyngeal chlorhexidine in these patients needs to be
explored further. We agree that it would be appropriate to
undertake additional prospective studies comparing selective
digestive decontamination, selective oropharyngeal
decontamination, and chlorhexidine11 65 after barriers to
implementation or any further trials have been explored.66

What is already known on this topic
Numerous studies and meta-analyses have shown a mortality benefit with use of selective digestive decontamination in patients in
intensive care
Meta-analyses have shown that oropharyngeal chlorhexidine is associated with a reduced incidence of ventilator associated pneumonia,
without a measurable effect on mortality
What this paper adds
This network meta-analysis showed that both selective digestive decontamination and selective oropharyngeal decontamination confer
a mortality benefit when compared with chlorhexidine in adult patients in general intensive care units
In these patients, selective digestive decontamination was associated with reduced mortality, as in earlier meta-analyses, but the current
analysis integrated a large recent cluster crossover study
It is possible that use of chlorhexidine is associated with an increase in mortality
