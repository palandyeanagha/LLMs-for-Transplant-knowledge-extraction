Budd-Chiari Syndrome
Aure´lie Plessier, M.D.,1 and Dominique-Charles Valla, M.D.1,2,3
ABSTRACT
Primary Budd–Chiari syndrome is related to thrombosis of hepatic veins or the
terminal portion of the inferior vena cava. This rare disease is usually caused by multiple
concurrent factors, including acquired and inherited thrombophilias. Half of the patients
with primary Budd–Chiari syndrome are affected with a myeloproliferative disease, the
recognition of which is largely based on the assessment of V617F Janus tyrosine kinase
2 (JAK2) mutation in peripheral granulocytes. A diagnosis of Budd–Chiari syndrome
should be considered in any patient presenting with acute or chronic liver disease, as clinical
manifestations are extremely diverse. Spontaneous outcome in symptomatic patients is
poor. Diagnosis can be made in most patients noninvasively when imaging shows venous
obstruction and/or collaterals. A treatment strategy is recommended where anticoagulation
is given first, followed by angioplasty when appropriate, then TIPS in patients not
responding to previous measure, and finally liver transplantation. This strategy has
achieved 5-year survival rates close to 90%.
KEYWORDS: Myeloproliferative disease, thrombosis, thrombophilia, transjugular

In the past, the term Budd–Chiari syndrome has
been used to designate various entities, which was occa￾sionally misleading. Recently, however, international
panels have agreed that Budd–Chiari syndrome (BCS)
be used as an eponym for hepatic venous outflow tract
obstruction, whatever the level or the mechanism of
obstruction.1,2 Cardiac and pericardial diseases are ex￾cluded from this definition as well as sinusoidal obstruc￾tion syndrome occurring in the context of an exposure to
toxic substances. BCS is further separated into secondary
BCS when related to compression or invasion by a lesion
originating outside the veins (benign or malignant
tumor, abscess, cyst, etc.); and primary BCS when related
to a primarily venous disease (thrombosis or phlebitis).
Obstruction of the hepatic venous outflow tract can be
classified according to its location: small hepatic veins
(HVs), large HVs, inferior vena cava (IVC), and com￾bined obstruction of large HVs and IVC.3
EPIDEMIOLOGY
Available data are scarce. The prevalence of BCS appears
to differ by several orders of magnitude according to the
area. In Nepal, BCS represents the leading cause for
hospital admission for liver disease,4 whereas it appears
to be very rare in Japan and in France.5 The level of
obstruction might also differ according to the area.
As a rule, pure IVC or combined IVC/HV block
has predominated in Asia, whereas pure HV block
has predominated in Western countries.5 There was a
slight predominance of males, and a median age 45 years
in Asia, while there was a marked preponderance of
females, and a youger median age (35 years) in the West.
However, a recent European survey showed an equal
distribution of pure HV block and combined IVC/HV
block,6 as well as a trend toward an increased proportion
of males and an older age at diagnosis.6 The reasons
for these geographical differences and temporal changes

in Europe are unclear. Environmental factors such as
oral contraceptive use (rare in Asia) and poor nutrition
(common in Nepal), discussed below, have been incrimi￾nated.4,5
CAUSAL FACTORS
Secondary Budd–Chiari Syndrome
Hepatocellular carcinoma, renal adenocarcinoma, adre￾nal adenocarcinoma, primary hepatic hemangiosar￾coma, epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, sarcoma of
IVC and right atrial myxoma, and alveolar hydatid
disease may cause BCS through invasion of the venous
outflow.7,8 Parasitic and nonparasitic cysts, and
abscesses can produce compression and thrombosis of
the hepatic venous outflow tract.9,10 Large nodules of
focal nodular hyperplasia in a central location may cause
compression of the hepatic veins.11 Compression or
kinking of the hepatic veins can occur following hepatic
resection or transplantation.12,13 BCS may occur
following blunt abdominal trauma, either from com￾pression by intrahepatic hematoma, IVC thrombosis
related to trauma, or herniation of the liver through a
ruptured diaphragm.14–16
Primary Budd–Chiari Syndrome
Most studies have yielded similar results: an underlying
prothrombotic disorder (or thrombophilia), or an estab￾lished risk factor for venous thrombosis, is found in a
majority of patients,17–26 as discussed elsewhere in this
issue (Primignani and Mannucci, pp. 293–301).
Recent advances in diagnostic tools have confirmed
that myeloproliferative diseases account for half of BCS
cases,
27–29 even though most patients with myeloproli￾ferative disease when they present with BCS have
normal or low blood cell counts of peripheral blood.
Factor V Leiden mutation, antiphospholipid syndrome,
and G20210A prothrombin gene mutation are the next
most common prothrombotic factors in BCS patients.
The role of hyperhomocysteinemia, and of primary
deficiency in protein C, protein S, or antithrombin
remains unclear because liver disease obscures recogni￾tion of these disorders. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglo￾binuria is an extremely rare condition, which is
complicated by Budd–Chiari syndrome in up to 30%
of patients, so that it accounts for 5% of BCS patients.
Behcet’s disease, where prevalent, has accounted for
the majority of BCS patients.30 Hypereosinophilic
syndrome,31 granulomatous venulitis,32 and ulcerative
colitis33 appear to be additional risk factors for BCS.
Pregnancy also appears to be a risk factor for BCS,
based on the temporal association between both con￾ditions,34–36 although no case–control study has been
performed to quantify this risk.
Environmental risk factors mainly consist of oral
contraceptive use in Western countries18,37 and factors
associated with a very poor standard of living in Asia.4
Overall, an underlying risk factor for thrombosis
has been found in up to 87% of BCS patients.38 A
combination of several causal factors is demonstrated in
25% of patients, where routinely investigated.17,18,38 A
combination with another causal factor is particularly
common in patients with heterozygous factor V
Leiden,20 or in oral contraceptive users37 or pregnant
women.36 It is remarkable that the local factor respon￾sible for development of thrombosis in the hepatic
venous outflow tract, a highly unusual site, remains
unidentified in most patients. Therefore, once a tumor
has been ruled out with imaging, a comprehensive work￾up for prothrombotic diseases should be performed in all
patients with BCS, whatever the location of the obstruc￾tion. Furthermore, an association of several prothrom￾botic conditions should be investigated. However, in
patients with a decreased level of coagulation factors
reflecting a decreased synthetic function of the liver, the
value of assessing plasma levels of protein C, protein S,
antithrombin, and homocysteine is questionable as the
results will be difficult to interpret.
MANIFESTATIONS AND COURSE
In most cases, the underlying disorders causing throm￾bosis of the hepatic venous outflow tract are unrecog￾nized at presentation. Presentation ranges from
complete absence of symptoms to fulminant hepatic
failure, through acute (rapid) or chronic (progressive)
development of symptoms over weeks to months before
diagnosis is made. The apparent age of the macroscopic
and microscopic damage to the veins or the liver may
differ from the apparent duration of symptoms.34,39
Asymptomatic Budd–Chiari syndrome accounts for 15
to 20% of cases.40 The absence of symptoms is strongly
associated with large hepatic vein collaterals.40 Classical
manifestations of BCS include fever, abdominal pain,
ascites, and leg edema. Jaundice, gastrointestinal bleed￾ing, and hepatic encephalopathy are less common.
Serum transaminases and alkaline phosphatase can be
normal or increased. Levels of serum albumin, serum
bilirubin and prothrombin can be normal or abnormal,
and in some patients markedly abnormal. Protein level in
ascitic fluid varies from patient to patient. Protein con￾tent above 3.0 g/dL is evocative of BCS, cardiac or
pericardial disease. The course of manifestations can be
steady, or marked by exacerbations and remissions. The
disease can run a long insidious course, or a short period
of prodrome followed by a rapid downhill course. Portal
venous obstruction is common in patients with severe
forms of the disease.41–43
Thus, a diagnosis of BCS must be considered in
all patients with an acute or chronic liver disease,

especially when common causes for liver disease have
been ruled out. In other words, an assessment of the
patency of IVC and HV should be part of the routine
evaluation of patients with liver diseases.
Natural history of symptomatic BCS appears to
be almost universally fatal. In a British cohort dating
back to the 1960s, when no specific therapy was yet
available, 90% of patients had died by 3 years.44 Main
causes of death are intractable ascites with emaciation,
gastrointestinal bleeding, and liver failure.
DIAGNOSIS
X-ray venography has been a reference for the evaluation
of the hepatic veins. However, for diagnostic purposes,
noninvasive imaging provides evidence for BCS in most
patients. Sonographic findings are well related to patho￾logical45 and venographic findings.46–48 The following
features have been considered specific for hepatic vein
obstruction on color Doppler imaging and pulse Doppler
analysis of hepatic vein wave form: (1) a large hepatic
vein appearing void of flow-signal, or with a reversed, or
turbulent flow; (2) large intrahepatic or subcapsular
collaterals with continuous flow connecting the hepatic
veins or the diaphragmatic or intercostal veins; (3) a
spider-web appearance usually located in the vicinity of
hepatic vein ostia, together with the absence of a normal
hepatic vein in the area; (4) an absent or flat hepatic vein
wave form without fluttering; and (5) a hyperechoic cord
replacing a normal vein. The absence of visualization or
tortuosity of the hepatic veins at gray-scale real-time
sonography albeit with flow signals at Doppler imaging
are common, but not specific; they are also observed in
advanced cirrhosis of other origin. A distinctive feature
for BCS, however, is the association with intrahepatic or
subcapsular hepatic venous collaterals, which is found
in over 80% of the cases. The major advantages of
ultrasound study, beyond sensitivity and specificity, are
relatively low cost, wide availability, complete lack of
harm, and minimal technical difficulty. Limitations lie in
patient’s body habitus, which may preclude complete
sonographic evaluation, and insufficient expertise of
the operator.
Spin-echo and gradient-echo magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) sequences and intravenous gadolinium
injection allow for visualization of obstructed hepatic
veins and IVC, intrahepatic or subcapsular collater￾als.45,49 MRI is not as effective as sonography in dem￾onstrating intrahepatic collaterals,45 whereas it might be
more accurate than direct inferior venacavagraphy for
characterizing solid endoluminal material. MRI is a
minimally invasive investigation. Some contrast agents
may alter kidney function. The techniques can be stand￾ardized and the results are not operator-dependent.
With computed tomography (CT), failure to
visualize the hepatic veins is considered suggestive for
hepatic vein obstruction. However, there were problems
of false-positive and indeterminate results in 50% of
the cases.45 There have been no clinical studies using the
most recent techniques for CT. Although CT is mini￾mally invasive, there is exposure to radiation, and a risk
for renal toxicity and reaction to iodinated products.
Direct evidence for thrombosis is rarely obtained
at needle liver biopsy. Nevertheless, liver biospy remains
the sole means to diagnose the rare form of BCS due to
involvement of the small hepatic veins with patent large
veins,3 although differentiation of this form from sinus￾oidal obstruction syndrome is not always feasible.3,50
Liver biopsy shows indirect, but strong, evidence for
hepatic venous outflow tract obstruction: congestion,
liver cell loss, and fibrosis in the centrilobular area are
considered characteristic features.3 There may be con￾siderable variation in the degree of these changes from
one area to the other. The main differential diagnoses
are heart failure, constrictive pericarditis, circulatory
failure, and sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. Although
venular and perivenular fibrosis without congestion is
occasionally found in patients with long-standing supra￾hepatic inferior vena cava obstruction,51 the absence of
congestion in the centrilobular area is a strong argument
against a diagnosis of hepatic vein thrombosis. Serious
consideration should be given to the risk of bleeding
from the puncture site in these patients who are likely to
receive early anticoagulation or emergent thrombolytic
therapy.
Other indirect signs of BCS may be of help for
diagnosis. Caudate lobe hypertrophy is found in 75%
of patients.45,52 However, enlargement is common as
well in many cases of cirrhosis of other origin.53 A
characteristic pattern of parenchymal perfusion can be
demonstrated using CT or MRI following bolus intra￾venous injection of contrast medium. This pattern con￾sists of early homogeneous central enhancement
(particularly at the level of the caudate lobe) together
with delayed patchy enhancement of the periphery of the
liver and prolonged retention of the contrast medium in
the periphery.45,54,55 This heterogeneity is related to
uneven portal perfusion. It is also observed in other
situations where portal venous perfusion is compro￾mised.53,56 One of these situations, constrictive pericar￾ditis, mimics hepatic venous obstruction clinically, and
can be missed at echocardiography.57
Nodular regenerative hyperplasia, and macrore￾generative nodules (enhancing at the arterial phase
of contrast injection) are common in patients with
longstanding BCS.41,42 These architectural changes
appear to be strongly related to the obstruction of
the corresponding portal vein branch and to increased
arterial inflow.41,42 Hepatocellular carcinoma has been
rarely reported and is mainly observed in patients with
long-standing disease, particularly in relationship to
suprahepatic inferior vena cava obstruction.20,58–60

TREATMENT
Underlying Risk Factors for Thrombosis
Oral contraceptives are generally considered to be con￾traindicated in patients with BCS. It is not clear whether
pregnancy should be considered contraindicated in pa￾tients whose underlying risk factors for thrombosis are
controlled, as there are reports of successful and uncom￾plicated pregnancies in patients with BCS given anti￾coagulation during the whole pregnancy.36,61
It is logical to treat underlying myeloproliferative
diseases. Neither the threshold in blood cell counts
where treatment should be initiated, nor the target
counts to be reached with therapy, have been assessed
yet. Low-dose acetyl salicylic acid has been shown to be
beneficial to prevent arterial disease in patients with
polycythemia vera, but data on venous thrombosis are
less clear.62 It is worth noting that acetyl salicylic acid
use is a risk factor for gastrointestinal bleeding in
patients with portal hypertension.63 For most other
risk factors for BCS, the only available treatment is
anticoagulation.
Anticoagulation Therapy
The rationale for anticoagulation in patients with pri￾mary BCS is based on the high prevalence of underlying
thrombophilia in such patients, and on the proven
efficacy of this treatment for deep vein thrombosis.64
Indefinite anticoagulation therapy is generally recom￾mended after an episode of idiopathic deep venous
thrombosis in patients in whom a permanent risk factor
is present and when thrombophilia is not curable.64
However, direct support for anticoagulation therapy in
BCS patients is lacking. There have been no prospective
randomized controlled trials of anticoagulation in pa￾tients with BCS. Two retrospective studies with multi￾variate analysis have attempted to evaluate the impact of
anticoagulation on mortality for BCS.65,66 The findings
supported a beneficial effect of anticoagulation, although
this benefit might be limited to the subgroup of patients
with less severe disease at baseline. Neither of these
2 studies included the presence of an underlying risk
factor for thrombosis in the analysis. Further circum￾stancial evidence for anticoagulation stems from (1) the
improved survival observed in all cohorts where, among
other treatments, anticoagulation was used6,67,68; and
(2) the improved results of liver transplantation69,70 or
hepatic vein angioplasty71 when anticoagulation medi￾cation was given.
There has been no report of bleeding-related
death in BCS patients on anticoagulation, but there
have been few studies on this particular issue. A recent
study disclosed a high rate of anticoagulation-related
complications in patients undergoing transhepatic inter￾ventional therapy. Moreover, a surprisingly high rate
of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia was observed,
mainly with unfractionated heparin.72 Therefore, when
anticoagulation of short duration is needed, low-molec￾ular-weight hepatin should be preferred. For long-term
therapy, vitamin K antagonists have been used aiming at
an international normalized ration (INR) of 2 to 3.67,68
Thrombolysis
The limited amount of available data on efficacy and
tolerance of pharmacologic thrombolysis has been re￾cently reviewed, and found to be inconclusive.73,74 There
is some indication that in situ infusion of thrombolytic
agents is associated with sustained patency of recently
thrombosed veins when thrombolysis is coupled with
restoration of a high blood flow velocity by means of
angioplasty or stenting.74
Treatment for Portal Hypertension
Guidelines for the management of portal hypertension￾related complications in patients with cirrhosis of other
causes have usually been applied to BCS patients.
However, circulatory changes seen in BCS patients
differ from those seen in patients with cirrhosis of other
causes. BCS patients have activated vasoactive neuro￾humoral systems and expanded plasma volume, but they
do not exhibit systemic vasodilation or increase in
cardiac output.75 Therefore, it remains to be assessed
whether b adrenergic blockade or endoscopic ligation
should be preferred as a first line of therapy in patients
that are not a candidate for angioplasty or transjugular
intrahepatic portosystemic shunting (TIPS).
Angioplasty and Stenting
The rationale for recanalization has been to decompress
the liver without compromising, and even with restor￾ing, hepatic blood flow. Patients with focal or segmental
obstruction of the hepatic venous outflow tract are
theoretically eligible for recanalization. Short-length
stenosis of the cephalad portion of one or several large
hepatic veins is present in 25 to 30% of patients with
pure hepatic vein block.76 Likewise, a so-called mem￾branous obstruction of the suprahepatic IVC (actually a
focal or segmental obliteration or stenosis) is found in up
to 60% of the patients with IVC block.8 In most patients
with suprahepatic IVC obstruction, the ostium of at least
one major hepatic vein is occluded or the hepatic vein
termination into the IVC is abnormal.8
Surgery for hepatic vein or IVC angioplasty and
for hepatoatrial anastomosis has been progressively
abandoned with the development of percutaneous pro￾cedures. Data on percutaneous angioplasty with or with￾out stenting consist of a limited number of retrospective
uncontrolled studies on cohorts of diverse size.71,77–97
262 SEMINARS IN LIVER DISEASE/VOLUME 28, NUMBER 3 2008

Percutaneous angioplasty by means of balloon or
Gruntzig catheters has usually been performed through
a transluminal transvenous route (either femoral or
jugular) for HVs or IVC, whether or not a stent was
primarily inserted. A transhepatic approach to recanal￾ization with stenting has also been used when a long
segment of a HV was occluded.
Severe procedure-related complications seem to
be rare with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty alone
(immediate thrombosis of the veins or pulmonary em￾bolism, generally amenable to thrombolytic therapy), but
might be more frequent with stent insertion through the
transluminal route (stent migration into the heart), and
with the transhepatic approach (bleeding). After suc￾cessful insertion, rapid improvement in signs, symptoms,
and liver function has generally been mentioned.
Reobstruction appears to be more common in patients
undergoing primary angioplasty alone than in patients
undergoing primary stenting. Prognostic factors for
reobstruction have not been assessed. Periprocedural
and total mortality appear to be low and not related to
the procedure. However, no evaluation based on initial
severity of the disease is possible. It should be remem￾bered that patients with short-length stenoses of the
hepatic veins, eligible for, but untreated with, recanali￾zation procedures have a better outcome than the other
patients.76
Portosystemic Shunting
The rationale for side-to-side portosystemic shunting
has been to decompress the liver using the portal venous
system as an outflow tract, thus at the expense of a
suppression of portal venous inflow. Depending on the
patency of the IVC, and on technical limitation related
to caudate lobe enlargement, several variants of surgical
side-to-side shunting have been used. A combination of
porto- or meso-caval shunts with IVC bypass or IVC
stenting has been used to cope with the compression of
IVC by caudate lobe enlargement. Overall perioperative
mortality has been high, averaging 25% (reviewed by
Langlet and Valla98). The rate of shunt dysfunction due
to early or late thrombosis or to late stenosis has reached
30% in series with long-term follow-up.99,100 Surgical
portosystemic shunting has been assessed in 4 multi￾center, retrospective, multivariate analyses, which failed
to show any impact on survival after adjustment for
independent prognostic factors.65,66,101,102 In these
4 studies, surgical shunting was considered on an
intention-to-treat basis, i.e., without consideration for
shunt patency. Recent data show that maintenance or
reestablishment of good shunt function is crucial for
long-term survival.103 Shunt dysfunction may be related
to stenosis of intrahepatic IVC (which is amenable to
stenting),80,103,104 to shunt stenosis (amenable to percu￾taneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting),78,80,105
and to shunt or portal vein thrombosis (amenable to in
situ thrombolysis).105 Risk factors for shunt dysfunction
appear to be the use of long prosthetic grafts.103,106
Routine anticoagulation did not prevent shunt dysfunc￾tion from occurring.103,107 Whether anticoagulation can
still have a protective effect cannot be assessed from the
limited data available.108
TIPS have been increasingly used for BCS treat￾ment in recent years.68,72,79,93,95,96,109–120 Indications
were generally claimed to be manifestations unrespon￾sive to medical therapy. Insertion was successful in over
80% of cases. After an average follow-up of 24 months,
dysfunction was reported in over half of patients. One￾month mortality rate was < 10%. Overall mortality rate
was 20%; 10% of patients underwent liver trans￾plantation. In some patients, however, TIPS was used as
a bridge to planned liver transplantation, whereas other
patients, whose condition improved, were not listed or
were withdrawn from the transplantation waiting list. In
most surviving and not transplanted patients, rapid
improvement in general condition, control of ascites,
and liver function has generally been described. There
has been no attempt at comparing the outcome follow￾ing TIPS insertion to that following surgical shunting,
after adjustment for prognostic factors. TIPS dysfunc￾tion as well as clinically significant events were less
common when using polytetraflouroethylene- (PTFE-)
covered stents than uncovered stents.121 A higher than
expected incidence of procedure-related bleeding has
been reported following TIPS insertion for treatment
of BCS as compared with other chronic liver dis￾ease.72,115 A learning curve effect for success and com￾plication rates, not for mortality, has been observed.72
The incidence of post-TIPS encephalopathy appears to
be low,68,121 but this contention has to be assessed.
Liver Transplantation
Data from 84% of the patients transplanted for BCS in
the European liver transplant registry between 1988 and
1999 have recently been analyzed.122 Half the patients
included in the European transplant survey belonged to
Rotterdam prognostic class III (with the worst baseline
prognosis66). Overall actuarial survival was 76% at one
year, 71% at 5 years, and 68% at 10 years.122 This survival
is almost identical to that in the intermediate class of risk
score (Rotterdam class II) from a contemporary U.S.–
Dutch–French cohort where a minority of patients
underwent transplantation. In surveys of consecutive
patients transplanted for BCS, 27 out of 142 patients
(19%) had been transplanted following portosystemic
shunting.69,70,110,117,123–128 Likewise, in the European
survey, 24% of patients had undergone TIPS or surgical
shunting.122 Previous surgical shunting or TIPS,
together with high serum creatinine and bilirubin levels,
was an independent marker of a poor outcome following

transplantation in the European survey,122 but not in the
U.S. database.129
A favorable impact of early and prolonged anti￾coagulation on the results of liver transplantation has
been suggested. In the European survey, 85% of patients
received anticoagulation posttransplant. Venous throm￾bosis at various sites recurred in 27 patients (11%).
Mortality was 40.7% in patients with recurrence.
Hemorrhage attributed to anticoagulants was observed
in 27 patients (11%). Two patients with intracranial
bleeding died and the mortality attributed to anticoagu￾lants was 1%.122
Some data indicate that for patients with myelo￾proliferative disease, a strategy combining hydroxyurea
and aspirin for prevention of thrombotic events might be
as effective as anticoagulation.130 There is no indication
that within 10 years of transplantation, there is a
significant increase in the risk of malignant transforma￾tion of underlying myeloproliferative disease as com￾pared with natural history in nontransplant patients.
Treatment Strategy
Consensus statements have been elaborated by interna￾tional expert panels in 20021 and 2005.2 In these docu￾ments, a strategy depicted in Fig. 1 was proposed,
consisting of the following graded approach: (1) anti￾coagulation, treatment of underlying condition, and
symptomatic treatment for complications of portal hy￾pertension in all patients with primary BCS; (2) active
search for venous lesions amenable to angioplasty/stent￾ing; (3) in patients not suited for, or unresponsive to
angioplasty/stenting, insertion of a TIPS should be
considered; (4) and in patients unresponsive to TIPS,
liver transplantation should be considered. Two recent
clinical studies provide support to the above strategy.
The outcome in these two cohorts (5-year survival over
85%) was clearly better than in cohorts managed mainly
with medical therapy or surgical shunting. In particular,
the improvement seen in all prognostic classes was most
marked in patients with the poorest baseline progno￾sis.131 From the relatively limited, but consistent data
available, it appears that the first step of the strategy
(medical therapy) is associated with steady improvement
in 10 to 20% of patients without any need for additional
therapy.72,95,132 Next, in Western countries where pure
hepatic vein block predominates, percutaneous recanal￾ization appears to achieve a complete response in an
additional 10 to 20% of patients; TIPS in an additional
65%; and liver transplantation in the rest. By contrast,
in Asia where suprahepatic IVC block predominates,
percutaneous recanalization can be expected to achieve a
complete response in 60% of patients, whereas the place
of TIPS, derivative surgery, and transplantation remains
unclear.86,95
It is obvious that a precise delineation of the
obstacle is crucial for planning therapy. For this purpose,
direct venography with measurement of pressure gra￾dient across stenoses, is usually necessary to complement
the information provided by noninvasive imaging. This
invasive procedure can be performed as the first part of
a recanalization or TIPS insertion procedure.
CURRENT OUTCOME AND PROGNOSIS
There has been continued improvement over the last
4 decades. In the most recently reported cohorts,
overall 5-year survival rates over 80% have been
achieved.66,68,72,113,118
Serum albumin, bilirubin, prothrombin, ascites,
and encephalopathy, or their combination as Pugh score,
have generally been found to be independent prognostic
factors.65,66,95,101,102 Corresponding prognostic scores
have been elaborated. These scores are most useful for
clinical studies, but not relevant to individual manage￾ment. Once components of the Child Pugh score were
taken into account, neither the site of hepatic venous
outflow tract obstruction, nor histological variables ap￾pear to bear independent prognostic value.65,66,95,101,133
Current concern for long-term outcome focuses
on the risks of late development of hepatocellular carci￾noma,
60 and of aggravation or transformation of under￾lying blood disease.134
SPECIAL GROUPS
Children
Data on BCS in children are scarce. Series of consecutive
cases date back to the early 1990s.34,135–137 There
appears to be a predominance of obstruction at the level

of suprahepatic inferior vena cava. Etiology remains
unclear as underlying prothrombotic diseases have not
been routinely investigated. There are, however, isolated
case reports of an association with factor V Leiden or
prothrombin gene mutation, antiphopholipid syndrome,
or celiac disease. Surgical as well as percutaneous therapy
(TIPS or recanalization), and thrombolysis have been
claimed beneficial in selected cases.
Patients with Combined Portal Vein and Hepatic
Venous Outflow Tract Obstruction
Extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis has been found in
15% of unselected BCS patients.43,133 Disease is usu￾ally more severe in these patients than in those with a
patent extrahepatic portal vein. TIPS, however, has been
possible and apparently effective in a handful of pa￾tients,138 whereas surgical portosystemic shunting and
liver transplantation apparently had poor results.43,133
Portal vein thrombosis was present pretransplant in 47 of
248 patients in the European survey on transplantation;
however, the impact of portal vein thrombosis on the
outcome of liver transplantation was not reported.122
