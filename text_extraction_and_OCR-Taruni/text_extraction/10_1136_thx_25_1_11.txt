Abstract


A description is given of the reaction to inhalation of Aspergillus
extract by seven patients with aspergillosis, including five with
aspergillomas. The nature of, and possible causes for, such reactions
are discussed on the basis of their resemblance to the
symptomatology of the vegetable dust syndromes. The findings may
contribute to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of fever in
aspergillosis.
