Abstract. Background: Biliary complications (BC) are
frequently observed following liver transplantation. The aim
of the present retrospective study, conducted at an
outpatients’ tertiary care hospital, was to determine the
incidence of biliary complications and risk factors
associated with their development in liver transplantation
(lT) patients. Materials and Methods: The medical records
were reviewed for all patients who underwent liver
transplantation at the Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark,
from 2000 to 2011 and were referred to the Aarhus
University Hospital for follow-up. Patients who died within
3 months of surgery or had incomplete clinical information
were excluded. All data for demographic characteristics and
possible risk factors for development of biliary stricture were
collected. Fifty-one patients were included. Results: The
median age at transplantation was 40 (range=7-64) years,
and 53% of patients were males. Biliary complications
occurred in 18 patients (35%), the majority of whom
developed strictures (12 patients, 24%). Univariate and
multivariate analyses revealed that cytomegalovirus infection
(p=0.008), hepatic artery obstruction (p=0.03) and hepatic
artery graft abnormalities (p=0.03) were independent risk
factors for the development of biliary strictures. Conclusion:
One-third of patients presented biliary complications after
liver transplantation, among which biliary strictures were
the most common. Cytomegalovirus infection, hepatic artery
stenosis and anatomical abnormality of the graft’s hepatic
artery are independent risk factors for the development of
biliary stricture.
Biliary complications (BCs) remain a major problem after
liver transplantation (1, 2) and are associated with a
significant burden of disease. An incidence of BC of 10-25%
has been reported following liver transplantation (LT) from
beating-heart donors, and even higher rates in transplantation
from non-beating heart donors (3-5). Biliary stricture (BS)
represents the most frequently observed post-LT biliary
complication. Typically, BSs occur within the first year of
LT (5-7), and the reported incidence of this type of
complication reportedly ranges from 10-25% following
deceased donor LT to 28-32% following living donor LT (4,
6-12). BSs are conventionally classified as anastomotic (AS)
and non-anastomotic (NAS). While the development of AS
is generally related to the surgical technique employed (13),
the etiology of NAS is less clear. Ischemic damage is often
regarded as the main cause of BS (6, 14-17).
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection has also been reported to
be associated with BS development, possibly mediated by
the immunological activation induced by this infection (18).
The incidence of BCs after LT in Denmark is unknown.
No previous study has identified the risk factors associated
with the development of BCs in a Scandinavian population.
Therefore, a study was performed on a group of patients who
underwent LT in Denmark to identify incidence of BCs, risk
factors associated with BS development and the impact of
BCs and BS on patient survival.

Materials and Methods
The medical records were reviewed of all patients that underwent
LT at Rigshospitalet in Copenhagen and were referred to Aarhus
University Hospital for follow-up from 2000 to 2011. This cohort
of patients was followed from the date of transplantation until
biliary complication diagnosis, death, or study end (August 15,
2012). Patients who died within 3 months of LT or had
incomplete clinical information were excluded. Fifty-one patients
were included in this study. For transplant recipients, age,
gender, body mass index, liver disease etiology, hepatitis virus
B and C infection, and presence of hepatocellular carcinoma,
diabetes mellitus and arterial hypertension before and after LT
were analyzed; for transplant donors, age, gender and mortality
due to cerebrovascular accidents were considered. Duration of
operation, duration of cold and warm ischemia, type of biliary
anastomosis (duct-to-duct anastomosis or hepaticojejunostomy)
and presence of anatomical abnormalities of the grafted hepatic
artery (HA) were also recorded. Episodes of acute rejection,
CMV infection and evidence of HA obstruction (stenosis or
thrombosis) were also recorded. After discharge from
Rigshospitalet, all patients were followed-up at the outpatient
clinic of Aarhus University Hospital.
For patients in whom cholestasis was suspected, the diagnostic
approach included an abdominal ultrasound to evaluate the biliary
tree and hepatic vasculature followed by a magnetic resonance
cholangiopancreatography and angio-computed tomographic scan
when required. In the presence of distal BS, an endoscopic
retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed with
sphincterotomy and stent placement when indicated. In cases with
proximal BS or endoscopic treatment failure, a percutaneous
transhepatic cholangiography and stent placement was considered.
Stents were changed every 3 months and permanently removed
after 1 year. Treatment was defined as successful when
cholangiography indicated BS resolution, cholestasis was
ameliorated, and symptoms were resolved. BS was diagnosed when
stenosis of the bile duct was observed on imaging in the presence
of biochemical cholestasis with or without clinical symptoms. AS
was diagnosed in the presence of a stenosis at the anastomotic
level. Strictures, dilatations or irregularities of the intra-and extra￾hepatic bile ducts, excluding the site of anastomosis, were
classified as NAS.
Statistical analysis. Categorical variables are reported as the number
and percentage of cases, and Pearson Chi-square and Fisher’s exact
tests were used for their comparisons. Continuous variables are
reported as medians. Student t-test was used for comparing
continuous variables with Gaussian distributions, while Mann–
Whitney U-tests were adopted for variables with skewed
distributions. Differences with p-values of less than 0.05 indicated
statistical significance. Initially, univariate logistic regression
analyses were performed to identify risk factors for the development
of BS. Subsequent multivariate logistic regression analysis was
performed including only variables with values of p<0.1 in the
univariate analyses. Risk prediction estimates are reported as p￾values, odds ratios (OR), and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).
Patient and graft survival rates were analyzed using the Kaplan–
Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. Statistical
analyses were performed and plots were generated using NCSS
2007 (NCSS, Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
The medical records were reviewed of 51 liver recipients with
a median follow-up of 53 months. The clinical and
demographic characteristics of patients are reported in Table
I. For surgical team policy, none of the patients had a T-tube
placed after transplantation. Biliary complications occurred
in 18 patients (35.3%). The most common complications
were strictures (15 patients, 29%). Of the patients with BS,
six (40%) developed AS, five (33%) NAS and four (27%)
both stricture types. The median time from LT to BS
diagnosis was 7.8 months (range=0.1-84.2 months). In seven

cases (47%), BS diagnosis was made within 6 months of LT,
and in eight cases (53%) within 1 year. The types and
presentations of biliary complications are reported in Table
II. The Kaplan–Meier plot (log-rank test) showed no
difference in patient or graft survival between patients with
and without BSs (p-values of 0.9 and 0.9, respectively).
Risk factors for the development of BS. In the univariate
analyses, CMV infection, HA obstruction (stenosis or
thrombosis) and anatomical abnormalities of the grafted HA
were associated with the development of BS. Duration of
cold and warm ischemia, duration of operation, episodes of
rejection and donor age were not significantly associated
with the development of BS (Table III). In the multivariate
analysis, CMV infection (OR=6.5; p=0.028), anatomical
abnormalities of the grafted HA (OR=8.4; p=0.042) and HA
obstruction (OR=7.4; p=0.048) appeared to be independent
risk factors for the development of BS (Table IV).
Discussion
Despite continuous progress in the field of LT (19), biliary
complications still affect a considerable number of LT patients
(3, 4, 20). In our study, we confirmed the presence of a high
BC incidence in a Danish population. Overall, 35% of LT

patients developed BCs, among which BSs were the most
common, developing in 29.4% of patients. These rates were
comparable with those reported in other studies conducted in
similar populations (6, 7, 21, 22). However, lower rates have
also been reported in some series (2, 23). These discrepancies
may be explained by differences in the definitions of BCs,
imaging techniques utilized for surveillance of BS and
duration of follow-up (24). As also reported previously, in our
series, BCs most often developed within 1 year of LT (6, 7).
The development of BSs after LT has previously been reported
to be associated with risk factors closely linked to ischemia,
such as long ischemia time, reperfusion injury and HA
thrombosis and stenosis (25-27). CMV infection and surgical
technique have also previously been correlated with BS
development (14, 28). In addition, recent studies have
suggested that ‘marginal donor characteristics’ such as donor
age and macrovesicular steatosis of the graft may also be
important in this context (21, 29, 30).
In our study, we confirmed previous findings suggesting
that HA stenosis and thrombosis were risk factors for the
development of biliary strictures (31-34). Moreover, we
observed a correlation between anatomical abnormalities of
the grafted HA and BS development, which may also be
related to ischemic damage to the biliary tree. The biliary tree
may be especially vulnerable to a reduction in arterial blood
flow from the HA; in fact, vascular supply to the allograft
biliary system is maintained by a unique HA terminating in
the peribiliary vascular plexus (16, 35, 36). The low number
of included patients did not allow a separate analysis of risk
factors associated with AS and NAS to be performed.
We confirmed the previously suggested association
between CMV infection and BS development (14). The
mechanism due to this association is likely immunological.
CMV is known to be a potent up-regulator of alloantigens,
thereby increasing the risk of acute rejection and chronic
allograft dysfunction; these mechanisms may be linked to the
development of vanishing bile duct syndrome and ductopenic
rejection, leading to chronic cholestasis and, eventually,
allograft failure (17, 37-40).
In contrast to the results of previous studies, we did not
identify any association between the duration of warm or
cold ischemia and the development of BS; neither did we
observe associations between either recipient gender or age
and the onset of this type of complication. However, it
should be noted that the mean recipient age in our study
population did not exceed 48 years. It has been suggested
that the peribiliary vascular plexus is better flushed out and
better preserved when low-viscosity rather than high￾viscosity fluids are used (41, 42). However, to our
knowledge, these observations have not yet been confirmed
in randomized control trials, and in our series, no association
was observed between the incidence of BS and the type of
preservation fluid utilized. Moreover, the biliary anastomosis
technique employed did not seem to play a role in the onset
of BS; in fact, no difference was observed between patients
who underwent duct-to-duct anastomosis and those who
underwent a hepaticojejunostomy. Although previous studies
have shown a shorter survival time in patients with BC (43),
we observed no differences in patient or graft survival,
which is in accordance with the findings of recent reports
(21, 44, 45). Early detection of BSs and therapeutic
intervention improvement in radiology or endoscopy may
easily explain these results (46).
The present study has certain limitations. Firstly, it was a
retrospective study, and the use of this methodology limited
our ability to comprehensively collect data for all variables
potentially influencing BS development, such as median
blood loss and graft steatosis frequency, as these data were
not available. Secondly, the small number of patients with
AS and NAS prevented us from performing separate
analyses focusing on these patient subgroups.
In conclusion, based on the results of our study, BSs still
represent an important complication in LT patients, and the
main mechanism involved in their development appears to be
ischemic damage. Immunological damage mediated by CMV
infection may also be involved in the onset of this complication.
