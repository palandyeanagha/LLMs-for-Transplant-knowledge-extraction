Dear Editor,
Secondary dyslipidemia is the most common form of 
lipid metabolism derangement, due to the fact that prim￾itive dyslipidemia represent only 0.5-2% of cases (1).
Transplantation is a common cause of dyslipidemia, it 
has been shown that it defines metabolic syndrome, a 
common finding in renal transplant recipients (RTR) (2), 
and statins are within the top 15 drugs used by these pa￾tients (3). Moreover the increasing prescription of statins 
in this population is related to the frequent screening for 
dyslipidemia in transplanted patients (3). Immunosup￾pression could cause hypercholesterolemia and Cyclo￾sporine (CsA) is widely used as immunosuppressive drug 
even if in the recent years physicians prescribe more fre￾quently Tacrolimus than CsA (3). Moreover renal function 
in RTR is reduced and in many causes they are long-term 
treated with steroids.
An additional risk factor for dyslipidemia should be 
taken into account in RTR such as chronic kidney disease, 
a condition in which triglycerides are increased and HDL￾cholesterol is reduced. The main causes of these altera￾tions are increased plasma levels of VLDL, IDL, LDL, Lp(a) 
and reduced activity of hepatic triglyceride lipase and 
peripheral lipoprotein lipase (4).
Hypercholesterolemia secondary to steroids is due to 
hyperinsulinemia and peripheral insulin resistance in￾creases hepatic synthesis of VLDL, moreover steroids re￾duce the release of ACTH with up-regulation of LDL-cho￾lesterol hepatic receptors (5).
On the contrary, the mechanism responsible for hyper￾cholesterolemia during CsA treatment is still a matter 
of debate. CsA is a lipophilic drug and is carried by HDL 
and LDL cholesterol; it has been suggested that the drug 
impairs hepatic clearance of LDL (6). Moreover hepatic 
sterol regulatory element binding protein-2 is activated 
leading to increased VLDL synthesis, and secretion of bile 
and bile salts is impaired causing reduced cholesterol 
elimination (7).
Hosseini et al. (8) study evaluated the relationship be￾tween CsA and dyslipidemia in RTR; they showed that 
plasma levels of cholesterol and triglycerides started 
increasing 4-12 months after beginning of immunosup￾pressive therapy, while subsequently HDL-cholesterol 
decreased and LDL-cholesterol increased. Logistic regres￾sion analysis showed that female gender and serum cre￾atinine were the major risk factors for hypercholesterol￾emia and hypertriglyceridemia; on the contrary, CsA was 
not related to them. Similar results were shown by Laufer 
et al. (9) in heart transplant recipients. In their study the 
main risk factors were the history of cardiac disease lead￾ing to transplantation and steroids therapy. Hricik et al. 
(10) evaluated RTR and showed that reduction of steroid’s 
dose caused decreasing total plasma cholesterol levels.
Cardiovascular disease is a major problem in RTR due to 
its relationship with morbidity and mortality and graft 
loss. Statins seem to have a protective effect in RTR, espe￾cially on risk of major cardiac events and they need to be 
considered during patients follow-up (4).
