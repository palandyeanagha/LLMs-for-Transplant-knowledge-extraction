Cytomegalovirus Induced 
Interstitial Nephritis and 
Ureteral Stenosis in Renal 
Transplant Recipient
To the Editor,
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections occur in up to 
60% of kidney transplant recipients, with most cases 
developing between the second and 6 months after 
transplantation [1]. The clinical manifestations of CMV 
infection vary widely. Asymptomatic viremia is the 
most common symptom, although the infection can oc￾casionally invade various organs such as the lung, or 
the gastrointestinal tract [2]. Likewise, in the urogenital 
tract, CMV can induce ureteral stenosis by direct inva￾sion of ureter tissue [3]. Involvement of grafted kidneys 
by CMV occurs frequently. In previous reports, CMV 
genomes were documented by in situ hybridization 
techniques in more than 40% of routine graft biopsies 
[3]. However, significant pathologic changes and al￾lograft dysfunction induced by CMV invasion are rarely 
observed. Indeed, CMV inclusions in tissue have been 
reported in less than 1% of renal biopsies when exam￾ined by routine light microscopy. Therefore, an alterna￾tive method to detect CMV involvement in graft kidneys 
is required.
In a previous report, pathological CMV nephritis was 
successfully diagnosed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) 
and tissue polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [3]. In this 
regard, the present case illustrates manifestation of 
CMV nephritis both by ureteral stenosis and CMV inter￾stitial nephritis, diagnosed by IHC stain for CMV. The 
patient was successfully treated with ganciclovir and 
immunosuppression reduction. We present this case re￾port with a review of the current literature.
Our patient was a 48-year-old Korean man who suf￾fered from end-stage renal failure attributed to hy￾pertension who had been on continuous ambulatory 
peritoneal dialysis for 2 years. He had received a living 
donor renal transplant in January 2010, but the specific 
record of the donor was not available because the proce￾dure was performed overseas in China. A week after the 
transplant, when he returned to Korea and visited the 
hospital, he was put on a dual therapy with tacrolimus 
and prednisolone with a serum creatinine of 3.1 mg/dL. 
Tacrolimus was titrated to 4 mg twice a day, mycophe￾nolate mophetil was continued 750 mg twice a day, and 
prednisolone was added at 25 mg twice a day. Labora￾tory investigations revealed the following values: white 
blood cells, 4,840/mm3
 with 94.5% polymorphonuclear 
cells, 1.4% lymphocytes, 4.1% monocytes; hemoglobin 
10 g/dL; hematocrit, 29.7%; platelet count, 151,000/
mm3
; creatinine, 3.1 mg/dL; total bilirubin, 0.45 mg/
dL; AST, 8 U/L; ALT, 9 U/L; albumin, 3.1 g/dL; random 
blood sugar, 133 mg/dL; C-reactive protein, 0.16 mg/dL; 
and urinary microscopic hematuria.
A Doppler ultrasound of the grafted kidney revealed 
hydronephrosis without visible obstructive lesions and 
favorable renal perfusion. The patient underwent per￾cutaneous nephrostomy and showed contrast leakage 
from the ureterovesical anastomosis. Subsequently, an 
anterograde double J (DJ) catheter was inserted with 
a ureteral stent via the right hypogastric posterolateral 
approach. A Doppler ultrasound performed after the 
catheter insertion showed complete regression of hydro￾nephrosis of the graft kidney; however, renal function 
was only partially recovered and the patient’s creatinine 
level hovered around 2.2 mg/dL 2 weeks after catheter 
insertion.
To evaluate the cause of the incomplete recovery of 
allograft function, a renal biopsy was performed that 
revealed calcineurin inhibitor toxicity with tubulopathy.

were seen on IHC stain (Figs. 1 and 2). Real-time PCR 
for serum CMV yielded 899,766 copies/mL, and CMV 
antigen was present in the patient’s blood on an im￾mune fluorescent test. Otherwise, real-time PCR for BK 
virus was neither found in urine nor serum, and decoy 
cell was absent in urine. Furthermore renal biopsy did 
not show anything on Simian virus (SV) 40 stain. The 
patient’s tacrolimus level was 15.6 ng/mL. The patient 
was then started on intravenous ganciclovir (2.5 mg/
kg q24) and the tacrolimus dose was reduced from 8 to 
6 mg/day. Mycophenolate mophetil was discontinued 
during the period of CMV treatment to decrease the in￾tensity of immunosuppression.
Intravenous ganciclovir was continued for 3 weeks 
after the biopsy, after which PCR for CMV was 1,031 
copies/mL. The patient was maintained on valgan￾ciclovir, 900 mg daily and discharged with a serum 
creatinine level of 2.2 mg/dL. CMV PCR was negative 
in a subsequent outpatient examination; however, de￾spite complete antiviral therapy, his renal function had 
deteriorated slightly. Ultrasounds of the graft kidney 
were normal, and a second biopsy was performed 38 
days after the first, the results of which were consistent 
with acute cellular rejection grade IA with negative IHC 
for CMV (Fig. 3). The patient was then readmitted and 
treated with intravenous methylprednisolone (125 mg/
day for 3 days) and switched to a tapering dose of oral 
prednisolone and discharged with a serum creatinine 
level of 1.41 mg/dL.
In this case, multiple factors such ureteral obstruction 
with leakage, calcineurin inhibitor toxicity, and CMV 
invasion altogether lead to the severe renal dysfunction. 
Therefore, renal dysfunction was not improved not only 
by resolution of hydronephrosis after DJ catheter inser￾tion, and it showed improvement with the clearance of 
CMV viremia. It suggests that CMV invasion may di￾rectly affect the renal dysfunction in this case. In previ￾ous report, only mild CMV invasion on renal biopsy was 
associated with renal dysfunction, and it maybe because 
renal biopsy specimen may not represent the whole 
status of kidney [4]. Although acute rejection could not 
have ruled out in the first renal biopsy, serologic and 
urine study of BKV real time PCR were negative, and 
considering the allograft biopsy finding, the possibility 
of the coexistence of BKV nephropathy, or acute rejec￾tion is very low. In addition, even though we did not 
perform any anti-rejection therapy and rather reduce 
tacrolimus dose, renal function improved.
Direct CMV-related allograft injury, as observed in 
our patient, is rarely reported in the literature. In a

review by Ulrich et al. [4], typical features of CMV in￾fection of the kidney were described as rare histologi￾cal findings. Renal biopsy may reveal acute interstitial 
inflammation associated with intranuclear inclusions, 
suggestive of direct cytopathic effects on tubular epi￾thelial cells by light microscopy. Kashyap et al. [1] ana￾lyzed the clinical parameters and pathologic findings 
in 10 patients with CMV inclusions via renal allograft 
biopsy with routine 3-μm hematoxylin sections. His￾topathologic examinations of the allografts showed 
interstitial inflammation with tubulitis in seven of 10 
(70%) patients, with the remaining three (30%) patients 
exhibiting viral inclusions without any associated in￾flammatory response. In our case, with the detection of 
viral inclusions on light microscopy, IHC stain for CMV 
antigen confirm the diagnosis of CMV induced allograft 
tissue injury.
In our case, hydronephrosis was revealed by Dop￾pler ultrasound of the graft kidney in combination with 
CMV infection. A percutaneous nephrostomy confirmed 
leakage from the ureterovesical anastomosis, which 
restored urine flow in the graft kidney, and serum cre￾atinine partially improved. It is possible that ureteral 
leakage develop as surgical complication. However, se￾vere hydronephrosis suggest that ureteral obstruction 
is more important problem, because leakage could not 
cause hydronephrosis. Therefore, we thought that ure￾teral obstruction may precede ureteral leakge, but the 
cause-result relationship could not be clarified.
Ducloux et al. [3] reported two cases of renal allograft 
recipients who experienced simultaneous CMV disease 
and ureteral stenosis. The association between the de￾velopment of ureteral stenosis and exposure to CMV is 
undoubtedly multifactorial, and it has been postulated 
that CMV may contribute to the disease process during 
abortive infections, which are characterized by viral￾gene expression limited to immediate early gene prod￾ucts without viral replication. Immediate gene products 
can inhibit p53 functions either by blocking the pro￾gression of the cell cycle or initiating apoptosis. Alter￾natively, tissue damage during permissive infection can 
lead to ureteral stenosis.
A second biopsy revealed mild improvement of calci￾neurin inhibitor toxicity and the disappearance of CMV 
infection, but it showed acute T cell mediated rejection, 
which was successfully treated by steroid pulse therapy. 
The development of acute T cell mediated rejection 
can be explained by two aspects. First, the decrease of 
immune suppressant can lead to the development of 
rejection. In this case, we discontinued mycophenolate 
mofetil and reduce tacrolimus. However, tacrolimus lev￾els were maintained within a therapeutic range, there￾fore it may not be the direct cause of acute rejection.
Second, CMV can be associated with the development 
of acute T cell mediated rejection through complex 
mechanism. Several previous studies have shown that 
CMV infection is associated with an increased risk of 
concurrent or subsequent acute rejection [4]. This may 
be related to the observation that CMV can up-regulate 
the expressions of histocompatibility antigens in tubu￾Figure 3. Second allograft biopsy. (A) Moderate interstitial infiltrate composed primarily of mononuclear cells involving 25% of renal

lar epithelium, thereby making it a better target for cell￾mediated immune injury, and that T cells sensitized 
to CMV antigens within the kidney or at extrarenal 
sites can release interferon-γ or tumor necrosis factor, 
thereby leading to parenchymal injury mimicking acute 
rejection. Cameron et al. [5] reported that patients with 
tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) due to CMV infection 
have a significantly higher incidence of acute rejection 
episodes than those with TIN due to other reasons .
In summary, we describe CMV interstitial nephritis 
combined with ureteral stenosis. Successful clearance 
of the viral infection by ganciclovir led to improvement 
in allograft function. A consecutive biopsy confirmed 
acute cellular rejection maybe triggered by CMV infec￾tion, which was recovered with steroid pulse therapy. 
This case suggest that in cases of allograft dysfunction 
with significant CMV viremia, we should consider al￾lograft biopsy with CMV IHC stain to differentiate the 
allograft dysfunction due to direct involvement of CMV 
in allograft tissue.
