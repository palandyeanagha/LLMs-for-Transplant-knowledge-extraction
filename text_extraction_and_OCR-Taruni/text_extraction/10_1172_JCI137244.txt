Introduction
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large family of respiratory viruses that 
can cause diseases ranging from the common cold to the Middle 
East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and the severe acute respiratory 
syndrome (SARS) (1, 2), both of which are zoonotic in origin and 
induce fatal lower respiratory tract infection as well as extrapul￾monary manifestations. The new CoV, officially designated as the 
SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a member of β-CoV lineage B, 
which was first identified in Wuhan by the Chinese Center for Dis￾ease Control and Prevention (CDC) (3, 4). Recent reports have pro￾vided evidence for person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 
in family and hospital settings (5, 6). As of February 2 7, 2020, the 
number of SARS-CoV-2 cases globally had eclipsed 82,567, largely 
exceeding the total number of SARS cases during the 2003 epi￾demic, and more than 2810 people have now died. The outbreak of 
SARS-CoV-2–induced coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has 
put health authorities on high alert in China and across the globe.
It has been revealed that SARS-CoV-2 has a genome sequence 
75% to 80% identical to the SARS-CoV and has more similarities 
to several bat CoVs (7). Both clinical and epidemiological features 
of patients with COVID-19 demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 
infection can cause clusters of severe respiratory illness with clin￾ical presentations greatly resembling SARS-CoV, leading to inten￾sive care unit (ICU) admission and high mortality (8). Clinical 
manifestations have included fever, fatigue, dry cough, shortness 
BACKGROUND. Since December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, and is now becoming a global threat. We aimed to delineate and 
compare the immunological features of severe and moderate COVID-19.
METHODS. In this retrospective study, the clinical and immunological characteristics of 21 patients (17 male and 4 female) 
with COVID-19 were analyzed. These patients were classified as severe (11 cases) and moderate (10 cases) according to the 
guidelines released by the National Health Commission of China.
RESULTS. The median age of severe and moderate cases was 61.0 and 52.0 years, respectively. Common clinical 
manifestations included fever, cough, and fatigue. Compared with moderate cases, severe cases more frequently had 
dyspnea, lymphopenia, and hypoalbuminemia, with higher levels of alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, 
C-reactive protein, ferritin, and D-dimer as well as markedly higher levels of IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α. Absolute numbers 
of T lymphocytes, CD4+
 T cells, and CD8+
 T cells decreased in nearly all the patients, and were markedly lower in severe 
cases (294.0, 177.5, and 89.0 × 106
/L, respectively) than moderate cases (640.5, 381.5, and 254.0 × 106
/L, respectively). The 
expression of IFN-γ by CD4+
 T cells tended to be lower in severe cases (14.1%) than in moderate cases (22.8%).
CONCLUSION. The SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect primarily T lymphocytes, particularly CD4+
 and CD8+
 T cells, resulting 
in a decrease in numbers as well as IFN-γ production by CD4+
 T cells. These potential immunological markers may be of 
importance because of their correlation with disease severity in COVID-19.
TRIAL REGISTRATION. This is a retrospective observational study without a trial registration number.
FUNDING. This work is funded by grants from Tongji Hospital for the Pilot Scheme Project, and partly supported by the 
Chinese National Thirteenth Five Years Project in Science and Technology for Infectious Disease (2017ZX10202201).

hospital patients with pneumonia were identified as laborato￾ry-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at Tongji Hospital. Of these 
patients, only 4, including a familial cluster of 3 confirmed cases, 
had direct exposure to the Huanan Seafood Market. According to 
the guidelines for diagnosis and management of COVID-19 (6th 
edition, in Chinese) issued by the National Health Commission 
of China (9), 11 (52.4%) patients with percutaneous oxygen sat￾uration (SpO2
) of 93% or lower or respiratory rates of 30/min or 
greater on room air who required high-flow nasal cannula or non￾invasive mechanical ventilation using the bilevel positive airway 
pressure (BiPAP) mode to correct hypoxemia, were classified as 
having severe COVID-19, whereas 10 (47.6%) patients not reach￾ing the criteria for severe COVID-19 were considered moderate. 
There were more male patients in both severe cases and moderate 
cases. The median age of the severe cases (61.0 years) was signifi￾cantly higher than moderate cases (52.0 years) (Table 1). More 
of breath, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Additionally, 
a study of the first 41 laboratory-confirmed cases with COVID-19 
showed that 63% of patients had lymphopenia, and cytokine 
storm could be associated with disease severity. However, infor￾mation on immunological features between severe and moderate 
COVID-19 is scarce (8).
In this study, we performed a comprehensive evaluation of 
characteristics of 2 1 patients with COVID-19 admitted to Tongji 
Hospital, Wuhan. We aimed to compare the clinical and immuno￾logical features between severe cases and moderate cases. These 
findings may help us extend our understanding of the risk factors 
associated with disease severity in the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

mon in severe cases. In addition, tachypnea and dyspnea were only 
developed in severe cases. All the severe cases developed dyspnea, 
and 9 of them with SpO2
 of 93% or lower showed no improved 
SpO2
 even with high-flow nasal cannula; these 9 cases were then 
ventilated using the BiPAP mode to treat hypoxemia. An arterial 
blood gas (ABG) test was performed in 10 patients on admission 
(6 severe and 4 moderate cases). Among them, the PaO2
/FiO2
 ratio 
was significantly lower in severe cases (104.8) than moderate cases 
(371.7), with 3 out of 6 severe patients below 100.
Laboratory findings and CT scans of severe and moderate 
COVID-19. Compared with the normal range, the whole blood 
count on admission of 3 (30%) moderate cases showed mild leu￾copenia, while white blood cell (WBC) counts were normal or 
slightly increased above the upper limit of normal (ULN) in all 
the severe cases (Table 2). Both WBC and neutrophil counts were 
severe cases had comorbidity. The median time from onset of 
symptoms to first hospital admission was 8.0 days in severe cases 
and 7.0 days in moderate cases.
Four of 11 severe cases died an average of 20 days after the 
onset of the illness. Of these 4 deceased patients, all of them were 
male and aged 50 years and older, with 2 cases having hyperten￾sion. The median age of deceased cases was 64.0 years. Three 
of the deceased cases had an arterial oxygen tension/inspiratory 
oxygen fraction ratio (PaO2
/FiO2
) of 100 or less on admission.
Excluding 1 patient without a clear history due to a disorder 
of consciousness (coma) (classified as a severe case), the most 
common clinical manifestations at onset of illness included fever, 
cough, fatigue, and myalgia. Less common symptoms included 
sputum production, diarrhea, headache, and hemoptysis. Com￾pared with moderate cases, chest tightness tended to be more com￾Table 2. Laboratory findings and chest CT images of patients with COVID-19

patients, 10 (90.9%) severe cases and 7 (70%) mod￾erate cases had bilateral involvement on admission 
(Table 2). The typical findings of chest CT images 
of severe COVID-19 on admission showed bilater￾al ground-glass opacity and subsegmental areas of 
consolidation (Figure 1A), then progressed rapidly 
with mass shadows of high density in both lungs 
(Figure 1B). Representative chest CT images of 
moderate COVID-19 showed bilateral ground-glass 
opacity (Figure 1C). Subsequent chest CT images (4 
days later) revealed that the bilateral ground-glass 
opacity had been resolved (Figure 1D).
Immunological features of severe and moderate 
COVID-19. We assessed plasma cytokine levels to 
examine the presence of cytokine storm in these 
patients. Evaluation of serum cytokines on admis￾sion revealed that levels of interleukin 2R (IL-2R), 
IL-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) 
were markedly higher in severe cases than in mod￾erate cases (Figure 2 and Supplemental Table 1; sup￾plemental material available online with this arti￾cle; https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI137244DS1). IL-1β
concentrations were undetectable (<5 pg/mL) in 
nearly all the patients with either severe or moder￾ate COVID-19. Overall, we found that macrophage-related proin￾flammatory cytokines, particularly IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α, were 
significantly increased in the majority of severe cases. Of note, IL-6 
levels were increased in both moderate and severe cases.
We next examined the proportions and effector functions 
of immune cells in peripheral blood (Figure 3 and Table 3). Pre￾liminary analysis of circulating immune cell subsets, as shown 
in Table 3, demonstrated that absolute numbers of total T lym￾phocytes, CD4+
 T cells, and CD8+
 T cells were reduced below the 
lower limit of normal (LLN) in the vast majority of patients with 
either severe or moderate COVID-19, and they were reduced 
more profoundly in severe cases (294.0, 177.5, and 89.0 × 106
/L, 
respectively) than in moderate cases (640.5, 381.5, and 254.0 × 
106
/L, respectively) (Figure 3, A and B). The proportion of B cells 
was significantly higher in severe cases (20.2%) than in moderate 
cases (10.8%). This could be partly due to the more significant 
decrease in T lymphocytes in severe cases. In addition, 6 (75.0%) 
of 8 severe cases showed a broad, significant decrease in all the 
lymphocyte subsets excluding B cells, with total T lymphocyte 
counts below 400 × 106
/L, CD8+
 T cell counts below 150 × 106
/L, 
significantly higher in severe cases than moderate cases, whereas 
lymphocyte counts were significantly lower in severe cases (0.7 × 
109
/L) than moderate cases (1.1 × 109
/L). Lymphopenia (lympho￾cyte count <0.8 × 109
/L) was developed in 8 (72.7%) severe cases 
and only 1 (10.0%) moderate case (P = 0.008). Overall, severe cas￾es had increased WBC counts (P = 0.003) but lower lymphocyte 
counts (P = 0.049).
Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotrans￾ferase (AST) levels were significantly higher in severe cases than 
moderate cases. Albumin concentrations were significantly low￾er in severe cases than moderate cases, and hypoalbuminemia 
(albumin < 32 g/L) was more frequent in severe cases (Table 2). 
Levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), concentrations of serum 
high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), ferritin, and D-dimer 
levels were markedly higher in severe cases than moderate cas￾es. In addition, serum levels of procalcitonin tended to be higher 
in severe cases than in moderate cases. These results suggest an 
increased level of systemic inflammation in severe cases.
Interstitial lung abnormalities were observed in chest comput￾ed tomography (CT) scans of all patients on admission. Of the 21

severe cases included secondary infection (2 7.3%), 
acute cardiac injury (9.1%), hypoxic encephalopathy 
(18.2%), acute kidney injury (18.2%), shock (9.1%), 
and acute liver injury (9.1%), most of which were not 
developed in any recovered cases.
All the severe and moderate cases were given 
empirical antimicrobial treatment (moxifloxacin 
and/or cephalosporin, etc.). Seven (63.6%) severe 
cases and all moderate cases received antiviral ther￾apy (oseltamivir and/or ganciclovir). In addition, all 
severe and moderate cases were administered cor￾ticosteroid (methylprednisolone) during the course 
of hospitalization. Nine (81.8%) severe cases and no 
moderate cases required noninvasive mechanical 
ventilation. As of February 2, 2020, 4 (36.4 %) of 11 
severe cases and none (0.0 %) of the moderate cases 
died, and the median number of days from illness 
onset to death was 20. One severe and 1 moderate 
case recovered. Patients were transferred to the des￾ignated hospital after being identified as having lab￾oratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Discussion
This is the first preliminary study to our knowledge 
descriptively evaluating the immunological char￾acteristics of patients with laboratory-confirmed 
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Both clinical and epidemi￾ological features of patients with COVID-19 have 
recently been reported (5, 6, 8, 10). However, there is 
insufficient knowledge of pathophysiological param￾eters, particularly immunological indicators, to 
understand the mechanism involved in COVID-19. 
Consistent with previous reports (8), the present 
study showed that a male predominance in the inci￾dence of COVID-19 has been noted, similarly to 
that of SARS-CoV, indicating males are more susceptible to SARS￾CoV-2 infection than females. Older males (>50 years old), partic￾ularly those with underlying comorbidities, may be more likely to 
develop severe COVID-19. The most common clinical manifesta￾tions at onset of illness included fever, cough, fatigue, and myalgia. 
Severe cases more frequently had dyspnea and developed acute 
respiratory distress syndrome. In terms of laboratory findings, 
leukocytosis (≥10 × 109
/L) and lymphopenia (<0.8 × 109
/L) were 
more common in severe cases than in moderate cases. ALT, LDH, 
D-dimer, and inflammatory markers including hsCRP and ferritin 
were significantly higher in severe cases than in moderate cases. 
Serum concentrations of both proinflammatory cytokines and anti￾inflammatory cytokines, including IL-2R , IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-10 
increased in the majority of severe cases and were markedly higher 
than those in moderate cases, suggesting cytokine storms might be 
associated with disease severity. Similarly, SARS was also charac￾terized by exuberant inflammatory responses and lung damage. A 
previous study using a mouse model of SARS demonstrated that 
rapid kinetics of SARS-CoV replication and delay in IFN-I signal￾ing promoted inflammatory monocyte-macrophage accumulation, 
resulting in elevated lung cytokine/chemokine levels, vascular 
leakage, and suboptimal T cell responses (11). The underlying cel￾and natural killer (NK) cell counts below 77 × 106
/L. Of these 6 
patients, 3 (50%) eventually died.
The frequencies of regulatory T cells (Tregs) (CD4+
CD25+
CD12 7lo) and CD45RA+
 Tregs were reduced (below the LLN) 
in nearly all the severe and moderate cases, and the CD45RA+
Treg proportion was markedly lower in severe cases (0.5%) than 
in moderate cases (1.1%). The reduced expression of interferon 
γ (IFN-γ) by CD4+
 T, CD8+
 T, and NK cells below the LLN was 
observed in some patients with severe (50%, 16.7%, and 16.7%, 
respectively) or moderate COVID-19 (14.3%, 0%, and 14.3%, 
respectively). The expression of IFN-γ by CD4+
 T cells tended to be 
lower in severe cases (14.1%) than moderate cases (22.8%) (Table 
3 and Figure 2C). However, there was no significant difference in 
terms of mean fluorescence intensity of IFN-γ production by CD4+
T, CD8+
 T, or NK cells (data not shown). Overall, we found a signif￾icant reduction in CD4+
 T cell count and a borderline reduction in 
IFN-γ expression in severe cases.
Complications and clinical outcomes of COVID-19. With regard 
to complications as shown in Supplemental Table 2, common com￾plications observed in severe cases included acute respiratory dis￾tress syndrome (100.0% of patients with available ABG data) and 
respiratory failure (83.3%). Less common complications among the

lular origin and mechanism involved in cytokine accumulation in 
COVID-19 warrants further exploration.
Additionally, we noted that SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause 
a significant reduction in circulating lymphocytes and T cell sub￾sets. Although the proportions of T cell subsets in peripheral blood 
remained within the normal range in most patients, decreased 
CD4+
 and CD8+
 T cell counts below the LLN were considerably 
frequent in both severe and moderate cases. More important￾ly, the number of CD4+
 and CD8+
 T cells was markedly lower in 
severe cases than moderate cases. In contrast, both the proportion 
and number of B cells were not reduced in most patients, with 
75.0% of severe cases showing an increased proportion of B cells. 
This could be partly due to the more significant decrease in T lym￾phocytes in these patients. It is notable that 6 out of 8 severe cas￾es and none of the moderate cases with available immunological 
data exhibited a broad, significant decline in all the lymphocyte 
subsets, excluding B cells. Of these 6 patients, 3 eventually died. 
Moreover, the production of IFN-γ by CD4+

T cells or NK cells tended to be lower in severe cases than mod￾erate cases. These data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection induc￾es lymphopenia, particularly in CD4+
 and CD8+
 T cells, as well as 
suppressed IFN-γ production by CD4+
 T cells, which correlates 
with disease severity of COVID-19.
Although the total Treg proportion was comparable between 
severe and moderate cases, severe cases showed a significantly 
lower proportion of CD45RA+
 naive Tregs (nTregs) and a slight￾ly higher proportion of their memory counterparts, CD45RO+
memory Tregs (mTregs). nTregs might be activated in the periph￾ery by antigen and subsequently converted to mTregs, and thus 
are thought to represent precursor cells of antigen-experienced 
mTregs and possess an equivalently strong suppressive capac￾ity as compared with mTregs (12). It is reported that peripheral 
homeostatic mechanisms are crucial in the control of Treg diver￾sity and concomitantly in the maintenance of immune tolerance 
in healthy individuals. Disturbances within these mechanisms 
may have detrimental consequences and could contribute to the 
development of certain diseases, particularly autoimmune dis￾eases (12). Whether the altered Treg proportions observed in the 
current study account for the severity of COVID-19, or correlate to 
the viremia, warrants further investigation.
CD4+
 T cells play a pivotal role in regulating immune respons￾es, orchestrating the deletion and amplification of immune cells, 
especially CD8+
 T cells. CD4+
 T cells facilitate virus-specific anti￾body production via the T-dependent activation of B cells (13). 
However, CD8+
 T cells exert their effects mainly through 2 mech￾anisms, cytolytic activities against target cells or secretion of cyto￾kines, including IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2, as well as many chemo￾kines (14). The production of IFN-γ is essential for the resistance 
against infection of various pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, 
and parasites (15). As a major source of IFN-γ, the ability of T cells 
to respond to infection is part of the adaptive immune response 
that takes days to develop a prominent IFN-γ response.
In this study, although decreased numbers of CD8+
 T cells 
were detected in severe cases, the proportion of CD8+
HLA-DR+
 T 
cells was slightly greater than that in moderate cases, which is in 
agreement with a recent case report (16). Circulating CD8+

known about the mechanism underlying the lymphopenia caused 
by SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we could not exclude the 
possibility that some of the lymphopenia may be worse due to the 
use of steroids during hospitalization. Further research is required 
to determine the effects of corticosteroids on lymphocytes in the 
context of COVID-19.
Our study has some limitations. First, we mainly evaluated 
the number of T cell subsets and NK cells as well as their IFN-γ
production; the function of these cells and the role of activated 
macrophages and lymphocytes infiltrating the pulmonary intersti￾tium remain to be elucidated. Second, this study only included a 
small number of patients; thus, the results should be interpreted 
with caution, and statistical nonsignificance may not rule out dif￾ferences between severe and moderate cases. Third, because data 
regarding the viremic profile of SARS-CoV-2 are not available, fur￾ther studies are needed to investigate the correlation between the 
viral load kinetics and the dynamics of cellular immune responses. 
Clarification of these questions will allow further dissection of the 
complex SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, with potential implications 
for the development of therapeutics and vaccines.
In conclusion, the SARS-CoV-2 infection induced cytokine 
storm and lymphopenia, particularly a decrease in CD4+
 and 
CD8+
 T cell counts, as well as suppressed IFN-γ production by 
CD4+
 T cells, which might be correlated with disease severity of 
COVID-19. Gaining a deeper understanding of the factors that 
affect lymphocytes, particularly T lymphocyte counts and their 
association with the disease severity in patients with SARS-CoV-2 
infection, is of importance for clinical management of COVID-19.
Methods
Study participants
From late December 2019 to January 2 7, 2020, a total of 2 1 cases who 
initially presented with fever or respiratory symptoms, with pulmo￾nary infiltrates on chest CT scans in the isolation ward of the Depart￾ment of Infectious Disease, Tongji Hospital, were later confirmed to 
be infected with SARS-CoV-2 by the local health authority. Four cases 
had a history of exposure to the Huanan Seafood Market.
We retrospectively evaluated and analyzed the medical history, 
physical examination, and hematological, biochemical, radiological, 
microbiological, and immunological evaluation results obtained from 
these 2 1 patients with COVID-19. Epidemiological, clinical, laborato￾ry, and radiological characteristics and treatment as well as outcome 
data were obtained from electronic medical records. The data collec￾tion forms were reviewed independently by 2 researchers.
Clinical classifications and complication definitions
According to the guidelines for diagnosis and management of COVID-19 
(6th edition, in Chinese) released by National Health Commission of 
China (9), the clinical classifications of COVID-19 are as follows:
Mild cases: The clinical symptoms are mild and no pneumonia 
manifestation can be found in imaging.
Moderate cases: Patients have symptoms like fever and respira￾tory tract symptoms, etc., and pneumonia manifestation can be seen 
in imaging.
Severe cases: Meeting any of the following — respiratory distress, 
respiratory rate ≥ 30 breaths/min; SpO2
 ≤ 93% at rest; and PaO2
/FIO2
 ≤ 
were found to harbor high concentrations of cytotoxic granule 
components, including perforin and granulysin (16). Furthermore, 
a cytokine storm was exhibited in nearly all these populations; the 
only currently available histological examination of a severe case 
who died of SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated lung interstitial mononu￾clear inflammatory infiltrates, dominated by lymphocytes, and 
multinucleated syncytial cells with atypical enlarged pneumocytes 
in the intra-alveolar spaces (16). These findings suggested that 
overactivation of cytotoxic CD8+
 T cells, along with overproduc￾tion of proinflammatory cytokines, might account for, at least in 
part, the immunogenicity of COVID-19. Nevertheless, the cellular 
source (T cells, dendritic cells, or macrophages) of these cytokines 
remains to be determined.
The roles of T cell responses in the context of SARS-CoV and 
MERS-CoV infection have been previously studied. Patients who 
survived SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections usually had better 
immune responses than those who did not (17). The immune sys￾tem plays an important role in both diseases, but it is differentially 
affected by the 2 viruses (18). A study in a mouse SARS-CoV model 
has shown that depletion of CD8+
 T cells at the time of infection 
does not affect viral replication or clearance. However, depletion 
of CD4+
 T cells leads to an enhanced immune-mediated intersti￾tial pneumonitis and delayed clearance of SARS-CoV from the 
lungs, demonstrating the vital role of CD4+
 T cells but not CD8+
T cells in primary SARS-CoV infection (19). A Chinese study in 
SARS-CoV–infected patients has demonstrated that the majority 
of infiltrative inflammatory cells in the pulmonary interstitium 
are CD8+
 T cells that play an important role in virus clearance as 
well as in immune-mediated injury (20). After comparing T cell–
deficient mice and B cell– deficient mice, it was found that T cells 
are able to survive and kill virus-infected cells in the MERS-CoV–
infected lung (21). These data highlight the importance of T lym￾phocytes, CD4+
 T cells in particular, but not B cells in controlling 
and fine-tuning the pathogenesis and outcomes of SARS-CoV 
and MERS-CoV infection. However, a cohort study investigating 
adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV infection revealed that 
despite no significant correlation between the total T cell respons￾es and disease progression, the disease severity correlates strongly 
with high-level CD4+
 T cell responses but not the CD8+
 memory 
T cell response (22). It is noteworthy that the immune responses 
evaluated in this study were in patients who recovered fully; thus, 
whether these responses contribute to recovery or disease pro￾gression remains unclear (22).
Chu et al. demonstrated that MERS-CoV, but not SARS-CoV, 
can efficiently infect T cells from the peripheral blood and from 
human lymphoid organs and induce apoptosis in T cells, which 
involves the activation of both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis 
pathways (23). This may partly explain the lymphopenia observed 
in MERS-CoV–infected patients (23). SARS-CoV can also signifi￾cantly decrease peripheral CD4+
 and CD8+
 T lymphocyte subsets 
and this was related to the onset of illness (24). Several poten￾tial mechanisms may be involved, including the development of 
autoimmune antibodies or immune complexes triggered by viral 
infection and directly infecting and promoting the growth inhi￾bition and apoptosis of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. 
The use of glucocorticoids may also account for the decrease 
in lymphocytes in some SARS patients (25). At present, little is

Evaluation of peripheral blood immunological indicators
The proportions and numbers of NK, CD4+ T, CD8+ T, Treg, and 
B cells, and the expression of cell surface markers as well as IFN-γ
expression by CD4+ T, CD8+ T, and NK cells were studied in these 
patients with laboratory- confirmed SARS - CoV-2 infection. Flow 
cytometry antibodies against human surface and intracellular 
molecules are commercially available. The following antibodies 
were used: anti-CD2 8 (CD2 8.2, PE, 55572 9), anti-CD8 (RPA-T8, 
PE- Cy7, 557 746), anti-CD45 (2D1, PerCP, 347464), anti–HLA￾DR (G46 -6, APC, 560744), anti-CD3 (SK7, APC- Cy7, 557832), 
anti-CD4 (RPA-T4, V450, 560345), anti-CD45RA (HI100, FITC,

anti-CD2 5 (M-A2 51, APC, 561399), anti-CD3 (SK7, APC- Cy7, 
557832), anti-CD4 (RPA-T4, V450, 560345), anti-CD3 (UCHT1, 
FITC, 561806), anti-CD8 (RPA-T8, PE, 555367), anti-CD56 (B159, 
PE- Cy7, 557 747), anti–IFN-γ (4S.B3, APC, 55138 5), and anti-CD4 
(RPA-T4, APC- Cy7, 5578 7 1). All reagents were purchased from 
Becton, Dickinson, and Company (BD). All samples were detected 
by a BD FACSCanto II flow cytometry system and analyzed with the 
BD FACSDiva software.
The steps of intracellular staining for IFN-γ in immune cells were 
as follows: GolgiStop (BD Biosciences, 554724) was added to cell cul￾tures for 4 hours and then the cells were resuspended in FACS buffer 
for flow cytometry antibody staining. Peripheral blood mononucle￾ar cells were stained for surface antibody at 4°C for 30 minutes and 
washed with FACS buffer followed by fixation/permeabilization (BD 
Cytofix/Cytoperm, 554722) at 4°C for 20 minutes in the dark. Fixed/
permeabilized cells were washed twice with Perm/Wash buffer (BD 
Biosciences, 554723) and then thoroughly resuspended in 50 μL of 
Perm/Wash buffer containing a predetermined optimal concentration 
of a fluorochrome-conjugated anti–IFN-γ antibody or appropriate neg￾ative control and incubated at 4°C for 30 minutes in the dark. Cells 
were washed twice with Perm/Wash buffer and resuspended in FACS 
buffer prior to flow cytometric analysis.
Statistics
Continuous variables were expressed as median (IQR) and compared 
with the unpaired 2-sided Student’s t test; categorical variables were 
expressed as number (%) and compared by χ2
 test or Fisher’s exact test 
between moderate and severe case groups. A 2-sided α of less than 
0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were 
done using SPSS (version 19.0, IBM).
Study approval
The study was performed in accordance with Good Clinical Practice 
and the Declaration of Helsinki principles for ethical research. The 
study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of 
Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Sci￾ence and Technology (Wuhan, China). Written informed consent was 
waived due to the rapid emergence of this infectious disease.

recruitment, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, 
300. Patients with greater than 50% lesion progression within 24 to 48 
hours in pulmonary imaging should be treated as severe cases.
Critically ill cases: Meeting any of the following — respiratory failure 
occurs and mechanical ventilation is required, shock, and complications 
from other organ failure that require monitoring and treatment in the ICU.
Acute respiratory distress syndrome and shock were defined 
according to the interim guidance of WHO for SARS-CoV-2 (26).
Hypoxemia was defined as a PaO2
/FiO2
 ratio of less than 300.
Acute kidney injury was identified and classified based on the 
highest serum creatinine level or urine output criteria according to the 
Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) classification.
Acute liver injury was defined as jaundice with a total bilirubin 
level of 3 mg/dL or higher and an acute increase in ALT of at least 5 
times the upper limit of the normal range and/or an increase in alka￾line phosphatase of at least twice the upper limit of the normal range.
Cardiac injury was diagnosed if serum levels of cardiac biomark￾ers (e.g., troponin I) were greater than the 99th percentile upper refer￾ence limit, or new abnormalities were shown in electrocardiography 
and echocardiography.
Secondary infection including bacterial and fungal was diagnosed 
if the patients had clinical symptoms or signs of nosocomial pneumo￾nia or bacteremia, and was combined with a positive culture of a new 
pathogen from a respiratory tract specimen or from blood samples tak￾en 48 hours or more after admission.
Laboratory measurements
Real-time reverse transcription PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2. Respiratory 
specimens were collected by the local CDC and then shipped to des￾ignated authoritative laboratories to detect SARS-CoV-2. The pres￾ence of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimens was detected by real￾time reverse transcription (RT-PCR) methods. Primers and probe 
targeting the CoV envelope gene were used and the sequences were 
as follows: forward primer, 5′-TCAGAATGCCAATCTCCCCAAC-3′; 
reverse primer 5′-AAAGGTCCACCCGATACATTGA-3′; and the probe 
5′CY5-CTAGTTACACTAGCCATCCTTACTGC-3′BHQ1. Conditions 
for the amplifications were 50°C for 15 minutes, 95°C for 3 minutes, 
followed by 45 cycles of 95°C for 15 seconds and 60°C for 30 seconds.
Clinical laboratory measurements. Initial clinical laboratory inves￾tigation included a complete blood count, serum biochemical test 
(including liver and renal function, creatine kinase, LDH, and elec￾trolytes), coagulation profile, as well as immunological test (including 
serum cytokines, peripheral immune cell subsets, and the expression 
of IFN-γ by immune cells). Respiratory specimens, including nasal and 
pharyngeal swabs or sputum, were tested to exclude evidence of other 
viral infections, including influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, avian 
influenza, parainfluenza, and adenovirus. Routine bacterial and fun￾gal examinations were also performed.
Cytokine measurement. To explore the influence of SARS-CoV-2 
infection on the secretion of cytokines, IL-1β, IL-2R , IL-6, IL-8 (also 
known as CXCL8), IL-10, and TNF-α were assessed in serum samples 
drawn shortly after hospital admission by chemiluminescence immu￾noassay (CLIA) performed on a fully automated analyzer (Siemens 
Immulite 1000, DiaSorin Liaison, or Roche Diagnostics Cobas e602) 
for all patients according to the manufacturers’ instructions. CLIA kits 
for IL-1β (LKL11), IL-2R (LKIP1), IL-8 (LK8P1), IL-10 (LKXP1), and 
TNF-α (LKNF1) were purchased from DiaSorin. An IL-6 kit (05109442 
190) was purchased from Roche Diagnostics.
