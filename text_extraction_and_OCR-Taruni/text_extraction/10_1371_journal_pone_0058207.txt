Abstract
Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (BMSCs) hold great potential for cell-based therapy, yet the
therapeutic efficacy remains uncertain. Transplanted BMSCs often fail to engraft within the bone marrow (BM), in part due
to the poor survival of donor cells in response to inflammatory reactions, hypoxia, oxidative stress, or nutrient starvation.
Two basic cell processes, apoptosis and autophagy, could potentially be responsible for the impaired survival of
transplanted BMSCs. However, the functional relationship between apoptosis and autophagy in BMSC homeostasis is
complex and not well understood. The stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1)/CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) signaling
axis appears to be critical in maintaining proliferation and survival of BM stem cell populations through improving cell
proliferation and survival in response to stress; however, the exact mechanisms remain unclear. We recently described novel
genetically engineered Tet-Off-SDF-1b BMSCs, which over-express SDF-1b under tight doxycycline-control, thus providing
an ideal model system to investigate the isolated effects of SDF-1b. In this study we tested the hypothesis that SDF-1b can
mediate cell survival of BMSCs in vitro through increasing autophagy. We found that SDF-1b had no effect on BMSC
proliferation; however, SDF-1b significantly protected genetically engineered BMSCs from H2O2-induced cell death through
increasing autophagy and decreasing caspase-3-dependent apoptosis. Taken together, we provide novel evidence that the
SDF-1/CXCR4 axis, specifically activated by the SDF-1b isoform, plays a critical role in regulating BMSC survival under
oxidative stress through increasing autophagy.

Introduction
Over the last decade, numerous studies have revealed that bone
marrow-derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (BMSCs) hold
great potential for cell-based therapy as BMSCs possess multi￾lineage potential [1]. For instance, both autologous and allogeneic
BMSCs have been utilized to repair or regenerate bone in
experimental and clinical studies [2,3]. However, attempts to
transplant BMSCs from whole bone marrow (BM), enriched
peripheral blood, or highly purified low-passage cultures almost
universally fail to significantly engraft within the BM when infused
into the peripheral circulation of animal and human subjects, in
large part due to the poor survival of donor cells [4–8]. After being
transplanted, BMSCs can face a complex hostile environment with
factors that may promote cell loss/death including inflammatory
reactions, hypoxia, oxidative stress including reactive oxygen
species, and nutrient starvation.
Two basic self-destructive cell processes, apoptosis (‘self-killing’,
programmed cell suicide) and autophagy (‘self-eating’, pro￾grammed cell recycling), could potentially be responsible for the
poor survival and engraftment of transplanted BMSCs used in
current cell therapy protocols. Apoptosis, on the one hand, is a set
of well-described forms of programmed cell death, which involves
the activation of proteolytic enzymes in signaling cascades leading
to the rapid destruction of cellular organelles and chromatin
[9,10]. On the other hand, three forms of autophagy have been
described, which in general mediate highly regulated mechanisms
of cell survival. Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as
autophagy) involves the bulk turnover of cytoplasmic proteins,
including damaged or pathologically aggregated proteins, in
a generalized fashion as part of a constitutive homeostatic
recycling process. Autophagy can be increased in response to
stress to provide critically needed nutrients and energy for cellular
survival; however, when extreme levels of autophagy are induced,
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 March 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 3 | e58207

it can also lead to ‘‘autophagic cell death’’ [11–13]. Furthermore,
autophagy can also specifically target distinct organelles (e.g.,
mitochondria in mitophagy or the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in
reticulophagy), thereby eliminating supernumerary or damaged
cell structures [11,12]. During autophagy, parts of the cytoplasm
and intracellular organelles are sequestered within characteristic
double- or multi-membrane autophagosomes and eventually
delivered to lysosomes for bulk degradation [11,12]. Importantly,
the functional relationship between apoptosis and autophagy in
BMSC homeostasis is complex and not well understood.
Increasing evidence suggests a critical role of the stromal cell￾derived factor-1 (SDF-1)/CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4)
signaling axis in maintaining proliferation and survival of BM stem
cell populations through improving cell proliferation and survival
in response to stress [14–16]. It has been speculated that SDF-1
may promote cell survival through two distinct mechanisms: post￾translational inactivation of the cell death machinery (e.g., increase
anti-apoptotic and decrease pro-apoptotic proteins) and increased
transcription of cell survival genes [15,17–20]. In contrast, very
little is known about the role of autophagy in stem cells. Three
recent reports revealed that MSCs possess high levels of basal
autophagy and that further induction of autophagy protects stem
cell populations from hypoxia and serum-deprivation-induced cell
death [21–23]. However, no direct link between the survival￾enhancing effects of the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis and autophagy in
BMSCs has been established.
Recently, we described genetically engineered Tet-Off-SDF-1b
BMSCs that conditionally express SDF-1b; with constitutive SDF￾1b overexpression and doxycycline (Dox)-mediated transgene
suppression [24]. Constitutive transgene expression results in
significantly increased SDF-1b mRNA (30-fold) and protein levels
(5-fold) relative to Dox-suppressed and Tet-Off-empty vector (EV)
control BMSCs, without altering the normal basal expression of
SDF-1 splice variants. Dox control of transgene expression is
tightly regulated in a dose-dependent manner with full suppression
at 100 ng/ml within 24 hours [24]. Hence, our model, employing
both an internal control (+Dox) and a second external empty
vector control, allows us to investigate the specific role of SDF-1b
in different cell processes with consistent, yet adjustable, cellular
expression levels, more akin to continuous endogenous exposure.
This avoids potential inconsistencies associated with direct
exogenous pre-conditioning, or transient genetic overexpression,
where cell exposure levels vary over time or depend largely on the
degree of vector transfection. SDF-1b was chosen over the more
abundant splice variant SDF-1a due to its greater resistance to
proteolytic cleavage suggesting that SDF-1b may be better suited
for local applications directly in the BM microenvironment,
especially in bone injury sites with increased inflammatory and
proteolytic activity [25–27]. Given the dearth of scientific
literature examining the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis in autophagy and
any specific contribution of the SDF-1b isoform to BMSC
proliferation and survival, we investigated the role of SDF-1b in
H2O2-induced cell death and tested the hypothesis that SDF-1b
mediates cell survival of BMSCs through increasing autophagy, as
well as decreasing apoptosis in vitro.
Materials and Methods
Isolation and Culture of BMSCs
BMSCs were derived from 18-month-old male C57BL/6J mice
at the Georgia Regents University Stem Cell Core Facility. Male
C57BL/6 mice were purchased from the National Institute on
Aging (Bethesda, MD, USA) aged rodent colony. Animals were
maintained at the Georgia Regents University - Division of
Laboratory Animal Services Facility. All aspects of the animal
research were conducted in accordance with the guidelines set by
the Georgia Regents University Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (GRU-IACUC) under a GRU-IACUC approved
Animal Use Protocol. The BMSC isolation process, retroviral
transduction to express Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), and
clonal selection have been described previously [24,28,29]. In
brief, six mice were euthanized by CO2 overdose followed by
thoracotomy. Whole bone marrow aspirates were flushed from
femora and tibiae and BMSCs isolated by negative immunodeple￾tion using magnetic microbeads conjugated to anti-mouse CD11b
(cat#558013), CD45R/B220 (cat#551513) (BD Biosciences
Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA), CD11c, and plasmacytoid
dendritic cell antigen (PDCA)-1 (cat#130-092-465) (Miltenyi
Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) followed by positive
immunoselection using anti-stem cell antigen (Sca)-1 microbeads
(cat#130-092-529) (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufac￾turer’s recommendations. Enriched BMSCs were labeled with
GFP [24,28,29], and maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle
Medium (cat#10-013) (DMEM; Cellgro, Mediatech, Manassas,
VA, USA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum (cat#S11150) (FBS; Atlanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA,
USA). As described in detail, clone 2 was used as the parental cells
for further genetic modification with the Tet-Off system at 70–
80% confluence [24].
Genetic Modification of BMSCs for Conditional
Expression of SDF-1b
BMSCs were transduced with retroviral Tet-Off expression
vectors. The sequential protocol of retrovirus production, two-step
infection, and selection to generate double-stable Tet-Off-SDF-1b
BMSCs and Tet-Off-EV control BMSCs has been described
previously [24]. In brief, 293GPG packaging cells [30] were
transfected at passage 8 with retroviral Tet-Off expression vectors
containing the SDF-1b coding sequence, or empty control
(cat#632105) (Clontech Laboratories, Mountain View, CA,
USA). BMSCs (clone 2) were infected at passage 10 with 2 ml of
the respective retroviral supernatant containing 4 mg/ml poly￾brene (cat#H9268) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and
100 ng/ml doxycycline (cat#D9891) (Dox; Sigma-Aldrich) fol￾lowed by selection with 400 mg/ml G418 (cat#091672548) (MP
Biomedicals, Solon, OH, USA) and 2.5 mg/ml puromycin
(cat#P8833) (Sigma-Aldrich). Clonally selected parental BMSCs
and Tet-Off-modified BMSCs were shown to retain their multi￾potent differentiation potential, including osteogenic potential,
over more than 10 passages both in vitro and in vivo upon
transplantation (see [24] and unpublished data). Genetically
engineered BMSCs were maintained in DMEM supplemented
with 10% Tet-FBS (cat#631106) (Clontech), 400 mg/ml G418,
and 2.5 mg/ml puromycin. For in vitro experiments, cells at
passage 16 were plated at 2.56103 cells/cm2 and then treated
with Dox starting the next day. The medium was exchanged daily.
To induce cell death, genetically engineered BMSCs were
incubated with 1.0 mM H2O2 or vehicle control for 6 h.
Cell Proliferation
Cell proliferation of BMSCs in normal growth medium was
measured over the course of 7 d using the VybrantH MTT Cell
Proliferation Assay Kit (cat#V13154) (Molecular Probes, Eugene,
OR, USA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. The
assay involves the conversion of the water-soluble MTT (3-(4,5-
dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) to an in￾soluble formazan, which is then solubilized using DMSO and its
absorbance measured at 540 nm.

Cell and Nuclear Morphology
Morphological changes of BMSCs in response to H2O2
treatment were visualized by phase contrast microscopy. Further￾more, the chromatin dye Hoechst 33342 was used to assess
alterations in the nuclear morphology. Cells were washed with
PBS, fixed with methanol for 10 min at 220uC, and stained with
5 mg/ml Hoechst 33342 (cat#62249) (Pierce, Thermo Fisher
Scientific) for 30 min at room temperature. BMSCs undergoing
cell death were visualized by standard phase contrast and
fluorescence microscopy using an inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss,
Jena, Germany) equipped with an Exfo X-Cite 120 fluorescence
lamp (Lumen Dynamics, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada).
Cell Viability
The viability of BMSCs in response to H2O2 treatment was
analyzed using standard trypan blue exclusion staining. Cells were
washed with PBS, lifted with trypsin/EDTA, and resuspended
with normal growth medium. Following 1:5 dilution, BMSC
suspensions were mixed with an equal volume of 0.4% trypan blue
staining solution (cat#15250061) (Gibco, Invitrogen), and counted
in 5 inner squares using a hemacytometer with cover slip (Hausser
Scientific, Horsham, PA, USA).
Western Blotting
Whole cell lysates of BMSCs in response to H2O2 treatment
were prepared in Complete Lysis-M EDTA-free buffer containing
protease inhibitors (cat#04719964001) (Roche Diagnostics, In￾dianapolis, IN, USA). Equal amounts (20 mg) of protein lysates
were subjected to SDS-PAGE using 10% NuPAGEH Bis-Tris gels
(cat#NP0315BOX) (Invitrogen) and transferred to 0.2 mm PVDF
membranes (cat#ISEQ00010) (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA).
Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk in TBST.
Apoptosis and autophagy markers were detected using specific
primary antibodies (anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)
(cat#9532), anti-cleaved PARP (cat#9544), anti-cleaved caspase￾3 (cat#9664): Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA;
anti-beclin 1 (cat#ab16998): Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA; anti￾LC3B-II (cat#R-155-100): Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO,
USA; anti-b-actin (cat#A1978): Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO,
USA) followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (D-anti￾Rb cat#711-035-152; D-anti-Ms cat#715-035-150) (Jackson
ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA). Bound antibodies
were visualized with the ECL detection system (cat#34080)
(Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific) on autoradiography film
(cat#E3018) (Denville Scientific, Metuchen, NJ, USA). The
intensity of immunoreactive bands was quantified using Photoshop
CS4 v11.0 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA, USA).
Statistical Analysis
Experiments were performed three independent times (n = 3–6).
All data are expressed as means 6 SD. Analysis of variance
(ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s or Bonferroni’s post hoc test were
used to determine mean differences between groups. Null
hypotheses were rejected at the 0.05 level. Data were analyzed
using GraphPad Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad Software Inc., La
Jolla, CA, USA).
Results
Cell Proliferation
To investigate the role of SDF-1b in cell proliferation, we
cultured BMSCs in normal growth medium and measured the
absorbance of DMSO-solubilized MTT formazan at 540 nm after
1, 3, and 7 days (Fig. 1). No differences in cell proliferation were
found in Tet-Off-SDF-1b BMSCs compared to Dox-suppressed
and Tet-Off-EV controls over the course of 7 d.
Cell and Nuclear Morphology and Viability
Next, we evaluated the potential role of SDF-1b in protecting
BMSCs from cell death. The concentration of H2O2 necessary
to deplete approximately 50–60% of BMSCs was established
previously in a series of dose-response and time course studies
(data not shown). BMSCs were incubated with 1.0 mM H2O2
for 6 h before the cell and nuclear morphology were assessed by
standard phase contrast microscopy and Hoechst 33342 staining
(Fig. 2 and 3). No differences in cell and nuclear morphology
were found among all vehicle-treated control groups. In
contrast, SDF-1b markedly protected Tet-Off-SDF-1b BMSCs
from H2O2-induced cell death relative to Dox-suppressed
(Fig. 2,3A) and Tet-Off-EV controls (Fig. 2,3B). Overall more
live cells retaining the typical spindle-shaped BMSC morphology
with normal round nuclei were observed compared to controls
showing substantial cell loss/shrinkage and condensed nuclei,
indicative of apoptosis.
These findings led us to quantify the total number of surviving
cells using a standard trypan blue staining protocol (Fig. 4). In
agreement with previous results, no differences in the number of
trypan blue negative and positive BMSCs were found among
vehicle control groups. In contrast, SDF-1b in Tet-Off-SDF-1b
BMSCs significantly increased the number of surviving cells and
decreased the number of dying cells in response to H2O2
treatment compared to Dox-suppressed (Fig. 4A) and Tet-Off￾EV controls (Fig. 4B) (trypan blue negative: Tet-Off-SDF-1b: 2Dox,

Apoptosis and Autophagy
To further characterize the mechanisms underlying the SDF￾1b-mediated protection from cell death, we investigated key
players involved in apoptosis and autophagy (Fig. 5). Western
blot analysis showed that the relative levels of apoptosis markers
PARP (Fig. 5C), cleaved PARP (Fig. 5D), and cleaved caspase-3
(Fig. 5E) as well as autophagy markers beclin 1 (Fig. 5F) and
LC3B-II (Fig. 5G) were comparable among all vehicle control
Figure 1. SDF-1b does not affect BMSC proliferation. Colorimet￾ric quantification of DMSO-solubilized MTT formazan at 540 nm showed
no differences in proliferation of Tet-Off-SDF-1b compared to Dox￾suppressed and Tet-Off-EV controls (1,3, and 7 d, 6100 ng/ml Dox,
n = 6, 3 independent experiments).

groups. In contrast, SDF-1b significantly increased the normal￾ized levels of intact PARP, decreased the levels of cleaved
PARP and cleaved caspase-3, and increased the levels of beclin

were found between H2O2-treated Tet-Off-EV control groups

Discussion
In the present study, our aim was to utilize genetically
engineered Tet-Off-SDF-1b BMSCs, which conditionally over￾express SDF-1b in absence of Dox [24] as a tool to investigate
whether SDF-1b could reduce H2O2-induced cell death through
increasing autophagy and decreasing apoptosis in BMSCs in vitro.
In the Tet-Off system, Dox prevents binding of the Tet-controlled
transactivator to the Tet-promoter on the response vector and thus
suppresses transcription of the downstream gene of interest, in our
case SDF-1b [31]. We previously showed that SDF-1b mRNA
expression by Tet-Off-SDF-1b BMSCs was 30-fold increased
compared to controls and this increase was accompanied by
a similar augmentation in SDF-1b protein levels, validating our
model [24]. Importantly, we utilized both an internal control
(+Dox) and a second external empty vector control, which have
been shown to possess comparable levels of SDF-1 splice variant

a greater number of cells with preserved morphology after H2O2 treatment relative to Dox-suppressed and Tet-Off-EV controls (6 h, 6100 ng/ml Dox,
61.0 mM H2O2, 206, 406, bar 100 mm, n = 3, 3 independent experiments).

expression and downstream effects when subjected to osteogenic
differentiation [24].
Previous studies have suggested a critical role of the SDF-1/
CXCR4 signaling axis in maintaining proliferation and survival of
stem cell populations in the BM [14]. In light of the growing
interest in using BMSCs for therapeutic applications, and reports
that SDF-1(a) pre-treatment or over-expression promotes the
proliferation and survival of rat and human BMSCs after re￾oxygenation following H2O2-treament or exposure to the apopto￾sis-inducing cytokine IL-4 [15,16], we asked if SDF-1b enhances
BMSCs proliferation and survival, and specifically if survival was
through effects of SDF-1b on apoptotic and/or autophagic
mechanisms. We showed in our system of Dox-controllable
expression, that increasing SDF-1b above basal levels had no
effect on BMSC proliferation over the course of 7 d compared to
controls. However, we found that increasing SDF-1b significantly
protected BMSCs from H2O2-induced cell death resulting in
increased numbers of surviving cells relative to controls, which also
retained their typical spindle-shaped morphology and normal
round nuclei. Hence, our studies suggest that SDF-1b-mediated
protection of BMSCs against cell death could be independent from
potential effects on cell proliferation.
Upon binding to its cognate receptor CXCR4, SDF-1 has been
implicated in modulating the survival-enhancing PI3-kinase/Akt
and MAP-kinase/Erk1/2 signaling pathways [32–35], which can
be blocked by the specific CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 [15]. In
addition, it was shown that SDF-1 can increase the levels of anti￾apoptotic Bcl-2 and decrease the levels of pro-apoptotic Bax
[15,18]. These findings led to the investigation of the cellular
mechanisms underlying the SDF-1b-dependent protection from
cell death in novel Tet-Off-SDF-1b BMSCs. Therefore, we
focused on key players involved in two cell death/survival
processes, apoptosis and autophagy, in response to oxidative
stress. Caspase activation plays a central role in the execution and
completion of apoptosis. In particular, caspase-3 is critical during
early apoptosis as it is involved in the proteolytic cleavage/

activation of many key proteins such as PARP and other caspases
[36,37]. Therefore, we asked whether it was possible for SDF-1b
to reduce caspase-3-dependent apoptosis in BMSCs. Using
Western blot analysis we showed that SDF-1b over-expression
significantly decreased the levels of cleaved caspase-3, resulting in
decreased levels of cleaved PARP and, in turn, increased levels of

intact PARP relative to controls suggesting that SDF-1b partially
blocked caspase-3-dependent apoptosis in BMSCs.
It is well accepted that similar stressors can induce either
apoptosis or autophagy in a context-dependent fashion. In some
cases, a mixed phenotype of apoptosis and autophagy can be
detected [38]. The induction of autophagy utilizes two ubiquitin￾like conjugation systems as part of the vesicle elongation process.
One pathway involves the covalent conjugation of Atg12 to Atg5
and the second pathway comprises the conjugation of phospha￾tidylethanolamine to LC3/Atg8. Lipid conjugation then leads to
the conversion of the soluble form of LC3-I to the autophagosome￾associated form LC3-II [39]. Another key player involved in the
onset of autophagy is beclin 1. Like other BH3-only proteins,
beclin 1 interacts with anti-apoptotic multi-domain proteins of the
Bcl-2 family via its BH3 domain, and this interaction can be
competitively disrupted to liberate beclin 1 and stimulate
autophagy [40–46]. Despite the well-characterized signaling
pathways involved, very little is known about the role of autophagy
in MSC maintenance and differentiation. In a recent study it was
shown that MSCs possess high levels of basal autophagy and that
suppression of autophagy through knockdown of Bcl-2-xL
dramatically impairs the survival and differentiation capacities of
human MSCs [22]. Furthermore, the activation of autophagy has
been linked to protection of MSCs from hypoxia and serum
deprivation through regulating the phosphorylation of mTOR
[21,23]. In addition, a genome-wide siRNA screening revealed
that under normal homeostatic conditions upregulation of
autophagy requires the type III PI3-kinase, but not inhibition of
mTORC1 [47]. Positive regulators of cell survival and pro￾liferation including SDF-1/CXCR4 were identified to be involved
in regulating autophagy in different cell types [47]. While these
findings are intriguing and provide new insight in the role of basal
autophagy in the maintenance of mammalian cells, thus far, no
direct link between the survival-enhancing effects of the SDF-1/
CXCR4 axis and autophagy in BMSCs has been established.
Thus, we asked if the observed SDF-1b-mediated reduction in
caspase-3-dependent apoptosis of BMSCs coincided with an
increase in autophagy. Western blot analysis revealed that SDF￾1b significantly increased the levels of LC3B-II and beclin 1
compared to controls, demonstrating an increase in autophagic
markers, and suggesting that SDF-1b exerts part of its cell￾protection through increasing autophagy in BMSCs. To our
knowledge, this is the first report of a direct interaction of the SDF￾1/CXCR4 signaling axis, and specifically the SDF-1b isoform,
with autophagy in BMSCs. Future studies aim to clarify the
autophagic pathways involved and to investigate the in vivo role of
SDF-1b in protecting BMSCs from cell death upon local or
systemic transplantation in models of bone disorders such as
fracture and osteoporosis.
Conclusion
In the present study we provide novel evidence that SDF-1b,
a more potent splice variant compared to SDF-1a, plays a critical
role in regulating BMSC survival under oxidative stress through,
at least in part, increasing autophagy in vitro. Our studies may
provide new opportunities to support BMSC-based therapies for
improving regenerative medicine approaches to treat acute and
chronic bone injuries.
