Since its introduction over 25 years ago as a
treatment for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma,
transarterial hepatic chemoembolization (TACE) has
undergone worldwide dissemination to become an es￾tablished therapy for both primary and secondary hepatic
malignancies. Although variations exist in the technique
of TACE, these technical differences share a common
set of complications. Major complications occur in 5%
of patients, with a risk of death of 1%. The interven￾tional radiologist needs a thorough understanding of the
complications unique to TACE and the time frame in
which these complications may develop. This article
reviews the vascular and nonvascular complications as￾sociated with TACE.
VASCULAR COMPLICATIONS
Vascular complications of TACE relate to arterial access
(puncture site complications, placement of a catheter in
the hepatic artery, injury to the hepatic artery itself) and
nontarget embolization are reviewed.
Access Site Injuries
Because TACE can be performed through small-caliber
diagnostic (4 to 5 French) catheters and microcatheters,
placement of large-diameter sheaths at the access site is
seldom necessary. Therefore, complications related to
puncture site access are uncommon. Access site hema￾toma is most frequently encountered and occurs in 2%
of patients. Arterial pseudoaneurysm and arteriovenous
fistula develop rarely and can be minimized with metic￾ulous puncture site planning to avoid puncture above the
inguinal ligament or at the superficial femoral artery.
Some centers have adopted the routine use of
arterial closure devices following chemoembolization to
enable more rapid ambulation and to limit the duration
of immobility needed following the procedure. Early

published experience with these devices in this patient
population is limited but suggests that they may be used
safely.1 A comprehensive review of complications related
to the use of these devices is beyond the scope of this
discussion; however, the decision to use a particular
device should consider the need for repeated puncture
for additional TACE.
Hepatic Artery Injury
Tortuous anatomy and congenital anatomic variations in
the hepatic arteries may require extensive catheter ma￾nipulation to enable access to the target artery. Advance￾ment of a catheter against resistance or without a
sufficient length of leading guide wire can produce
arterial spasm, dissection, or thrombosis.2 The routine
use of microcatheters for chemoembolization may re￾duce the risk of arterial injury although this has not been
established. Arterial spasm is usually managed with the
use of vasodilators. Dissection and acute thrombosis are
more problematic as they may prevent placement of a
catheter into the target location and can impair inflow
for delivery of the chemoembolic mixture to the tumor
(Fig. 1).
Nontarget Embolization
Nontarget embolization is among the most devastating
complications of hepatic chemoembolization. Nontarget
embolization may occur from (1) lack of recognition of
arterial supply to nonhepatic structures or (2) reflux of
chemoembolic agents back along the catheter during
delivery.
Nearly half of the general population harbors
some form of anatomic variation of arterial blood supply
to the liver, which includes replacement of the right
hepatic artery from the superior mesenteric artery, re￾placement of the left hepatic artery from the left gastric
artery, presence of a middle hepatic artery, or accessory
right or left hepatic arteries.3 These variations under￾score the need for thorough visceral arteriography prior
to initial chemoembolization.
Nontarget embolization of the left or right hep￾atic artery with chemoembolic agents may result in
mucosal ulceration or perforation. Identification of these
vessels is therefore of paramount importance. In patients
with a large left lobe, the left gastric artery may be
difficult to distinguish from a replaced left hepatic artery.
Having the patient swallow effervescent granules during
the procedure to produce distension of the stomach may
be helpful in making this distinction, as the left gastric
branches will follow the lesser curvature of the stomach.
Oblique arteriography is an additional useful adjunct.
The mucosa of the gastric fundus may exhibit a prom￾inent arterial blush; when treating hypervascular tumors
of the left lobe of the liver, this must be borne in mind.
The origin of the right gastric artery is variable
but most commonly arises from the proper hepatic
artery, the common hepatic artery, and the right hepatic
artery. When visible, the embolization catheter should
be positioned well beyond this vessel. Routine emboli￾zation of this vessel has been performed prior to hepatic
artery infusion of chemotherapy,4 but routine emboliza￾tion of this vessel prior to chemoembolization has not
been established. A balloon occlusion technique has also
been described to avoid embolization of gastric branches
during TACE.5
Nontarget embolization of the gastroduodenal
artery may also result in mucosal ulceration and perfo￾ration.6 Chemotherapy-induced ulceration may be ex￾tremely difficult to manage, even with aggressive proton
pump inhibition and use of sucralfate. Nontarget embo￾lization of pancreaticoduodenal branches of the gastro￾duodenal artery can result in pancreatitis. Anatomic
variations of the hepatic artery with a trifurcation of
the gastroduodenal right and left hepatic arteries may
pose a higher risk of injury to the gastroduodenal artery.
In these circumstances, meticulous fluoroscopic moni￾toring during chemoembolization is necessary.
Cystic artery embolization during TACE is asso￾ciated with prolonged postembolization syndrome and
may produce chemical cholecystitis with marked right
upper quadrant pain and gallbladder wall thickening
(Fig. 2).7 When targeting right lobe tumors, positioning
the catheter beyond the cystic artery with careful fluoro￾scopic monitoring during chemoembolization can avoid
this complication in most patients. However, the dis￾tribution of tumor burden in the right hepatic lobe may
require deliberate embolization of this vessel. Most
patients can be treated conservatively, without the need
for cholecystectomy or percutaneous cholecystostomy.8

gastric artery; catheterization of this vessel was not possible
during this setting.

Chemoembolization of extrahepatic collaterals
may be necessary in patients with hepatocellular carci￾noma (HCC) with parasitized blood supply. The infe￾rior phrenic artery is among the most common sites of
collateral supply for HCC near the dome of the liver.
Embolization of this vessel predictably produces a var￾iable degree of pleural inflammation with effusion and
pleuritic chest pain (Fig. 3). Empyema formation has
also been reported and mandates percutaneous or surgi￾cal drainage.9
Cutaneous branch embolization, such as the supe￾rior epigastric artery, can result in second- or third-degree
skin burns. Arora et al described four patients with
cutaneous ulceration from chemoembolization; one

gallbladder to a normal appearance. Cholecystectomy was unnecessary.

required percutaneous drainage.

patient developed a radiation burn from multiple sessions
of chemoembolization, which eventually degenerated
into squamous cell carcinoma.10
Pulmonary Embolization
Embolization of lipiodol to the lungs may occur
through arteriovenous shunting or portovenous shunt￾ing.11 This shunting may not be detectable during
TACE. Mild cases of lipiodol embolization may be
asymptomatic and discovered incidentally by computed
tomography (CT) with high-attenuation areas of lung.
Larger amounts of lipiodol to the lung can produce a
chemical pneumonitis and may be fatal.12 Lipiodol
volume exceeding 20 mL has been identified as a
risk factor for pulmonary embolization.13 Patients
with tumors supplied by extrahepatic collaterals appear
to be at higher risk of pulmonary embolization of
lipiodol.14
Particle embolization to the lungs may occur with
smaller particle diameters. The actual threshold below
which pulmonary embolization may occur has not been
established, and whether microsphere embolics are at
higher risk of pulmonary embolization is unknown.
Brown reported three fatal cases of pulmonary emboli￾zation following the use of 40- to 120-mm trisacryl
gelatin microsphere embolization shortly after these
microspheres became available for use in the United
States. No instances were observed using microspheres
of larger diameter.15
NONVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS
Postembolization Syndrome
Postembolization syndrome occurs in 90% of patients
following TACE, manifested by fever, malaise, right
upper quadrant pain, nausea, and vomiting. Patients and
their caregivers need to be apprised of this prior to
TACE and provided with adequate analgesics and
antiemetics for symptom control.
Leung et al analyzed predictors of severe
postembolization syndrome and found that gallbladder
embolization and higher doses of chemoembolic
agents correlated with prolonged postembolization
syndrome.7
Other Toxicities
Alopecia, myelosuppression, leukopenia, and anemia
may all be seen following TACE. Kessler et al reviewed
common toxicity data for 149 patients following 436
TACE procedures using cisplatin, mitomycin-C, and
adriamycin.16 Anemia occurred in 2.7% of patients. In a
study by Civalleri et al, myelosuppression was seen in
44% of patients following 69 sessions of TACE.17
Infection
HEPATIC ABSCESS AND BILOMA
The pathophysiology of biloma formation involves
ischemic injury to the peribiliary capillary plexus,
which is supplied by branches of the hepatic artery.
As a result, the integrity of the biliary tree is disrupted
with subsequent biloma formation.18 Bacterial seeding
of these bilomas can produce a hepatic abscess. An￾other mechanism is the development of an abscess
within the necrotic center of a devascularized hepatic
tumor. In either situation, patients who have chronic
colonization of the biliary tree with enteric flora are at
significantly higher risk of hepatic abscess formation.
This includes patients with a surgical bilioenteric
anastomosis, seen commonly among patients with
pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors who have under￾gone a prior Whipple procedure. However, patients
with biliary stents will have complete colonization of
the biliary tree with enteral flora within 72 hours of
stent placement. Prior sphincterotomy resulting in an
incompetent sphincter of Oddi, can also produce
biliary colonization (Fig. 4).
In the series of 157 patients from the University
of Pennsylvania, hepatic abscess developed in six of seven
patients with prior bilioenteric anastomosis.19 All
patients had received a standard regimen of broad￾spectrum prophylactic antibiotics. Hepatic abscess de￾veloped at a mean of 19 days between TACE and
hepatic abscess formation. The authors concluded
this subgroup of patients mandated a more aggressive
antibiotic prophylaxis regimen and closer monitoring
following TACE.
In a small retrospective series, the group at Johns
Hopkins observed no instances of hepatic abscess among
four patients with prior bilioenteric anastomosis when an
aggressive bowel preparation was used, compared with
hepatic abscess in four of four patients who received
Figure 4 CT scan showing hepatic abscess in the right lobe of
the liver in a 46-year-old man with metastatic neuroendocrine
tumor. The patient had a history of previous biliary obstruction
treated with endoscopic stent placement and had undergone
TACE 5 months previously. The patient received an aggressive
bowel preparation and antibiotic prophylaxis at the time of TACE.
Cultures following percutaneous drainage grew coagulase￾negative Staphylococcus and Streptococcus constellatus.

standard antibiotic prophylaxis.20 At our institution, we
have adopted a similar bowel preparation protocol for all
patients with prior bilioenteric anastomosis who are
undergoing TACE. Neomycin 1 g plus erythromycin
base 1 g are given at 1 PM, 2 PM, and 11 PM the day prior
to TACE. Levofloxacin and metronidazole and given
intravenously while in hospital and continued orally for
2 weeks following the procedure. A review of 15 TACE
procedures among six patients using this protocol
found an incidence of hepatic abscess of 13%, compared
with 43% among patients with bilioenteric anastomoses
receiving conventional antibiotic prophylaxis.21
The normal post-TACE appearance of the liver
on CT commonly includes gas formation within embol￾ized hepatic tumors, with areas of fluid-dense material.
These can confound the diagnosis of hepatic abscess
formation, and diagnostic aspiration may be needed to
establish the diagnosis of hepatic abscess.
Most patients with hepatic abscess can be success￾fully treated with a combination of percutaneous drain￾age and long-term parenteral antibiotics. In the Penn
series, no patient died as a result of hepatic abscess and
all responded to medical therapy and drainage. However,
the natural history of untreated or undertreated hepatic
abscess is associated with a high mortality.22,23
BACTEREMIA AND SEPSIS
Bacteremia and sepsis may be seen following TACE,
even among patients without prior bilioenteric anasto￾mosis. For this reason, most interventional radiologists
use prophylactic antibiotics at the time of TACE. Reed
et al observed a 2.6% rate of infection among a retro￾spective series of 236 patients who had received prophy￾lactic antibiotics, compared with 11% among patients
who received no antibiotics. Instances of fatal sepsis were
observed in the group that received no antibiotics.24 In
our practice, we administer intravenous cefazolin and
metronidazole at the time of TACE and continuing
while the patient is in hospital, followed by a 5-day
course of oral amoxicillin/clavulanate or ciprofloxacin.
EXTRAHEPATIC ABSCESS
Extrahepatic abscess following TACE is rare but has
been reported in the spleen,25 lung,26 and subphrenic
space.27,28
Biliary Strictures
Patients with biliary obstruction are at higher risk of
biliary injury, with resultant stricture and biloma for￾mation. This risk remains elevated even when patients
have undergone percutaneous or endoscopic drainage of
the involved segment(s) prior to TACE. Patients with
extrahepatic biliary obstruction have a higher vascular
permeability of the peribiliary capillary plexus,29 which
may account for this susceptibility.
Biliary strictures of the common hepatic or com￾mon bile duct will usually require percutaneous or endo￾scopic biliary drainage, particularly when cholangitis is
present. Segmental biliary obstruction from strictures of
isolated ducts may also predispose a patient to cholangi￾tis and require drainage.
Hepatic Failure
The combination of elevated lactate dehydrogenase
> 425 mU/mL, aspartate transaminase > 100 mL, se￾rum bilirubin > 2 mg/dL, and tumor burden > 50% of
liver volume is widely used as a criterion for identifying
patients at high risk for hepatic failure following
TACE.30 However, these thresholds are derived from
a single unpublished series and have never been system￾atically or prospectively studied. Consensus exists that
the risk of hepatic failure is dependent on baseline
hepatic synthetic function. For this reason, most inter￾ventional radiologists will not treat patients with Child
C liver disease. However, liver failure may also occur in
patients with Child A or B disease. In a prospective
study, Huang et al observed an acute liver failure rate of
13.4% among 142 patients with HCC undergoing
TACE, defined as increased Child-Pugh score  2,
increase in serum bilirubin  2 mg/dL, or new ascites/
encephalopathy within 2 weeks of the procedure.
Among 103 patients with Child A disease, liver failure
occurred in 4%, compared with 38% of 39 patients with
Child B disease.31 Among 351 patients undergoing 942
TACE procedures, Chung et al (using the same criteria
of liver failure) found an incidence of acute liver failure
of 15%.32 Most of these cases were transient; permanent
deterioration in liver function occurred in 5.7% of all
patients.
Patients with portal vein thrombosis are at higher
risk of liver failure following TACE, but these patients
can still be treated when adequate collateral flow exists to
the liver.33 In our own practice, we perform TACE in a
superselective fashion when portal vein thrombosis is
present, using reduced amounts of the chemoembolic
mixture.
Variceal Bleeding
TACE produces elevation in portal blood flow34 and
portal pressure35 and in rare instances may precipitate
variceal bleeding in patients with coexisting portal
hypertension.32,36
Renal Failure
The risk of developing acute renal failure is multifacto￾rial. Huo et al prospectively evaluated 140 patients
undergoing TACE for acute renal failure, defined as
an increase in serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL. By this

definition, acute renal failure developed in 9% of pa￾tients; a third of these patients developed chronic renal
insufficiency. Repeated TACE, severe postembolization
syndrome, diabetes, and severity of underlying liver
disease were identified as significant risk factors for the
development of acute renal failure.37 Kim et al reported a
case of acute renal failure following TACE in a patient
with normal renal function; renal failure was attributed
to the combination of volume depletion from severe
postembolization syndrome and contrast nephropathy.38
The risk of dehydration can be minimized
through vigorous hydration in the periprocedural period.
When administering TACE regimens involving neph￾rotoxic agents (e.g., cisplatin), this is particularly critical.
At the University of Pennsylvania, we administer normal
saline intravenously at 150 mL/h for 3 L, commencing 1
to 2 hours prior to TACE. Thereafter, half-normal
saline is given at 80 mL/h until the patient resumes
adequate intake of oral liquids.
Release of Neurohumoral Factors
TACE of metastatic carcinoid and other functional
neuroendocrine tumors of the liver may result in mas￾sive hormonal release following the procedure. For this
reason, all patients are pretreated with octreotide prior
to TACE. Massive serotonin release from carcinoid
tumors can produce hypertensive crisis through activa￾tion of 5-hydroxytryptamine vascular smooth muscle
receptors with resultant vasoconstriction. These pa￾tients require close observation in the postprocedure
period and management of blood pressure in a moni￾tored unit may be required in the first 24 hours. The use
of meperidine (Demerol1, Sanofi-Synthelabo Inc.,
New York, NY) should also be avoided in carcinoid
patients as it inhibits serotonin metabolism and can
exacerbate hypertensive effects following TACE.39 Pa￾tients with insulinomas may require an infusion of
dextrose immediately following TACE to avoid hypo￾glycemia, and patients with glucagonomas may require
a sliding scale of insulin. Centers performing TACE for
patients with neuroendocrine tumors vary in their
dosage of octreotide prior to TACE; in our practice,
we advocate the use of high-dose (500 mg subcutane￾ously) octreotide immediately prior to TACE in these
patients.
SUMMARY
With careful patient selection and evaluation, major
complications following hepatic chemoembolization
are uncommon. However, certain at-risk patient popu￾lations exist and warrant adjustment of the TACE
protocol and/or postprocedure monitoring. Awareness
of these scenarios and their management are critical to
performing TACE safely with optimal outcomes.
