On August 7, 2020, this report was posted as an MMWR Early 
Release on the MMWR website (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr).
In April 2020, during the peak of the coronavirus disease 
2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Europe, a cluster of chil￾dren with hyperinflammatory shock with features similar to 
Kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome was reported in 
England* (1). The patients’ signs and symptoms were tem￾porally associated with COVID-19 but presumed to have 
developed 2–4 weeks after acute COVID-19; all children had 
serologic evidence of infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus 
that causes COVID-19 (1). The clinical signs and symptoms 
present in this first cluster included fever, rash, conjunctivitis, 
peripheral edema, gastrointestinal symptoms, shock, and 
elevated markers of inflammation and cardiac damage (1). On 
May 14, 2020, CDC published an online Health Advisory 
that summarized the manifestations of reported multisystem 
inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), outlined a case 
definition,† and asked clinicians to report suspected U.S. cases 
to local and state health departments. As of July 29, a total 
of 570 U.S. MIS-C patients who met the case definition had 
been reported to CDC. A total of 203 (35.6%) of the patients 
had a clinical course consistent with previously published 
MIS-C reports, characterized predominantly by shock, cardiac 
dysfunction, abdominal pain, and markedly elevated inflam￾matory markers, and almost all had positive SARS-CoV-2 test 
results. The remaining 367 (64.4%) of MIS-C patients had 
manifestations that appeared to overlap with acute COVID-19 
(2–4), had a less severe clinical course, or had features of 
Kawasaki disease.§ Median duration of hospitalization was 
6 days; 364 patients (63.9%) required care in an intensive care 
* https://www.rcpch.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2020-05/COVID-19-Paediatric￾multisystem-%20inflammatory%20syndrome-20200501.pdf. †The MIS-C case definition included a patient aged <21 years with fever, 
laboratory evidence of inflammation, and evidence of clinically severe illness 
requiring hospitalization, with multisystem organ involvement (cardiovascular, 
dermatologic, gastrointestinal, hematologic, neurologic, renal, or respiratory) 
who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 or had exposure to COVID-19. https://
www.cdc.gov/mis-c/hcp/. §Kawasaki disease is an acute febrile illness of unknown cause, primarily affecting
children, and associated with fever, rash, conjunctivitis, redness in the mouth, 
cracked lips, and swollen lymph nodes, feet, and hands.
unit (ICU), and 10 patients (1.8%) died. As the COVID-19 
pandemic continues to expand in many jurisdictions, clini￾cians should be aware of the signs and symptoms of MIS-C 
and report suspected cases to their state or local health depart￾ments; analysis of reported cases can enhance understanding 
of MIS-C and improve characterization of the illness for early 
detection and treatment.
Local and state health departments reported suspected 
MIS-C patients to CDC using CDC’s MIS-C case report 
form, which included information on patient demographics, 
clinical findings, and laboratory test results. Patients who 
met the MIS-C case definition and were reported to CDC as 
of July 29, 2020, were included in the analysis. Latent class 
analysis (LCA), a statistical modeling technique that can divide 
cases into groups by underlying similarities, was used to identify 
and describe differing manifestations in patients who met the 
MIS-C case definition. The indicator variables used in the 
LCA were the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2–positive 
test results by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-PCR) or serology, shock, pneumonia, and involvement of 
organ systems (i.e., cardiovascular, dermatologic, gastrointesti￾nal, hematologic, neurologic, renal, or respiratory). Three-class 
LCA was conducted using the R software package “poLCA” 
with 100 iterations to identify the optimal classification scheme 
(5). Clinical and demographic variables were reported for 
patients by LCA class. Chi-squared or Fisher’s exact tests were 
used to compare proportions of categorical variables; numeric 
variables, with medians and interquartile ranges, were com￾pared using the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test.
As of July 29, 2020, a total of 570 MIS-C patients with onset 
dates from March 2 to July 18, 2020, had been reported from 
40 state health departments, the District of Columbia, and 
New York City (Figure). The median patient age was 8 years 
(range = 2 weeks–20 years); 55.4% were male, 40.5% were 
Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic), 33.1% were non-Hispanic 
black (black), and 13.2% non-Hispanic white (white) 
(Table 1). Obesity was the most commonly reported underlying 
medical condition, occurring in 30.5% of Hispanic, 27.5% of 
black, and 6.6% of white MIS-C patients.

Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report
US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention MMWR / August 14, 2020 / Vol. 69 / No. 32 1075
Overall, the illness in 490 (86.0%) patients involved four or 
more organ systems. Approximately two thirds did not have 
preexisting underlying medical conditions before MIS-C onset. 
The most common signs and symptoms reported during illness 
course were abdominal pain (61.9%), vomiting (61.8%), skin 
rash (55.3%), diarrhea (53.2%), hypotension (49.5%), and 
conjunctival injection (48.4%). Most patients had gastroin￾testinal (90.9%), cardiovascular (86.5%), or dermatologic or 
mucocutaneous (70.9%) involvement. Substantial numbers of 
MIS-C patients had severe complications, including cardiac 
dysfunction (40.6%), shock (35.4%), myocarditis (22.8%), 
coronary artery dilatation or aneurysm (18.6%), and acute 
kidney injury (18.4%). The majority of patients (63.9%) were 
admitted to an ICU. The median length of ICU stay was 5 days 
(interquartile range = 3–7 days).
Of the 565 (99.1%) patients who underwent SARS-CoV-2 
testing, all had a positive test result by RT-PCR or serology; 
46.1% had only serologic evidence of infection and 25.8% 
had only positive RT-PCR test results. Five patients (0.9%) 
did not have testing performed but had an epidemiologic link 
as indicated in the MIS-C case definition.
Among all 570 patients, 527 (92.5%) were treated, includ￾ing 424 (80.5%) who received intravenous immunoglobulin 
(IVIG), 331 (62.8%) who received steroids, 309 (58.6%) who 
received antiplatelet medication, 233 (44.2%) who received 
anticoagulation medication, and 221 (41.9%) who were treated 
with vasoactive medication. Ten (1.8%) patients were reported 
to have died (Table 1).
LCA identified three classes of patients, each of which had 
significantly different illness manifestations related to some of 
the key indicator variables. Class 1 represented 203 (35.6%) 
patients who had the highest number of involved organ 
systems. Within this group, 99 (48.8%) had involvement of 
six or more organ systems; those most commonly affected 
were cardiovascular (100.0%) and gastrointestinal (97.5%). 
Compared with the other classes, patients in class 1 had sig￾nificantly higher prevalences of abdominal pain, shock, myo￾carditis, lymphopenia, markedly elevated C-reactive protein 
(produced in the liver in response to inflammation), ferritin 
(an acute-phase reactant), troponin (a protein whose presence 
in the blood indicates possible cardiac damage), brain natri￾uretic peptide (BNP), or proBNP (indicative of heart failure) 
(p<0.01) (Tables 1 and 2). Almost all class 1 patients (98.0%) 
had positive SARS-CoV-2 serology test results with or without 
positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results. These cases closely 
resembled MIS-C without overlap with acute COVID-19 or 
Kawasaki disease.
Class 2 included 169 (29.6%) patients; among those in this 
group, 129 (76.3%) had respiratory system involvement. These 
patients were significantly more likely to have cough, shortness

of breath, pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome 
(ARDS), indicating that their illnesses might have been primar￾ily acute COVID-19 or a combination of acute COVID-19 
and MIS-C. The rate of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positivity 
(without seropositivity) in this group (84.0%) was significantly 
higher than that for class 1 (0.5%) or class 3 (2.0%) patients 
(p<0.01). The case fatality rate among class 2 patients was the 
highest (5.3%) among all three classes (p<0.01).
Class 3 included 198 (34.7%) patients; the median age of 
children in this group (6 years) was younger than that of the 
class 1 patients (9 years) or class 2 patients (10 years) (p<0.01) 
(Table 1). Class 3 patients also had the highest prevalence of 
rash (62.6%), and mucocutaneous lesions (44.9%). Although 
not statistically significant (p = 0.49), the prevalence of coro￾nary artery aneurysm and dilatations (18.2%) was higher than 
that in class 2 patients (15.8%), but lower than that in class 
1 patients (21.1%). Class 3 patients more commonly met 
criteria for complete Kawasaki disease (6.6%) compared with 
class 1 (4.9%) and class 2 (3.0%) patients (p = 0.30), and had 
the lowest prevalence of underlying medical conditions, organ 
system involvement, complications (e.g., shock, myocarditis), 
and markers of inflammation and cardiac damage. Among 
class 3 patients, 63.1% had positive SARS-CoV-2 serology 
only and 33.8% had both serologic confirmation and positive 
RT-PCR results.
Discussion
Initial reports of MIS-C patients described varied clini￾cal signs and symptoms at initial evaluation, but most cases 
included features of shock, cardiac dysfunction, gastrointestinal

symptoms, significantly elevated markers of inflammation and 
cardiac damage, and positive test results for SARS-CoV-2 by 
serology (3,6–8). Because the case definition is nonspecific 
and confirmatory laboratory testing does not exist, it might be 
difficult to distinguish MIS-C from other conditions with over￾lapping clinical manifestations such as severe acute COVID-19 
and Kawasaki disease (9). Latent class analysis is particularly 
well-suited to describe differing manifestations of a novel 
clinical syndrome. It divides patients into groups that might 
have been previously unrecognized, based on shared charac￾teristics, allowing for an unbiased determination of disease 
manifestations. Patients identified in class 1 had little overlap 
with acute COVID-19 or Kawasaki disease, whereas patients 
in class 2 had clinical and laboratory manifestations that

overlapped with acute COVID-19. This overlap might result 
from the development of MIS-C soon after symptomatic acute 
COVID-19 illness. However, the presence of isolated severe 
acute COVID-19 illness cannot be ruled out in some of these 
patients. Patients in class 3 generally seemed to have less severe 
MIS-C illness and clinical manifestations that overlapped with 
Kawasaki disease, and distinguishing class 3 patients from 
those with true Kawasaki disease could be difficult (4). As the 
COVID-19 pandemic spreads, and more children are exposed 
to SARS-CoV-2 with subsequent seroconversion, patients with 
Kawasaki disease might be misidentified as MIS-C because of 
an incidental finding of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.
Overall, the age distribution of the patients in this analysis 
is similar to that described elsewhere, but there are differences 
in the clinical manifestations and laboratory findings, perhaps 
due to differences in inclusion criteria (6,7). Increases in 
COVID-19 incidence might result in increased occurrence of 
MIS-C which might not be apparent immediately because of 
the 2–4-week delay in the development of MIS-C after acute 
SARS-CoV-2 infection (8). The proportion of Hispanic, black, 
and white MIS-C patients with obesity is slightly higher than 
that reported in the general pediatric population.¶ Hispanic 
and black patients accounted for the largest proportion 
(73.6%) of reported MIS-C patients. Acute COVID-19 has 
been reported to disproportionately affect Hispanics and blacks 
(10). Long-standing inequities in the social determinants of 
health, such as housing, economic instability, insurance status, 
and work circumstances of patients and their family members 
have systematically placed social, racial, and ethnic minority

populations at higher risk for COVID-19 and more severe 
illness, possibly including MIS-C.**
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limi￾tations. First, there is a possibility of case identification and 
reporting bias, including variability in diagnosis, testing, and 
management of patients by different jurisdictions. Second, 
inconsistency in completion of case report forms, with some 
patients still hospitalized at the time of reporting, might have 
affected data completeness (e.g., race and ethnicity were not 
reported for 18.9% of cases). Third, access to SARS-CoV-2 
testing at the time of onset might have varied by regions, 
hospitals, and time. Finally, CDC’s case definition was broad, 
with the intention of being more inclusive, which might have 
led to the unintentional inclusion of patients whose illnesses 
overlapped with acute COVID-19 and Kawasaki disease.
As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, with the number 
of cases increasing in many jurisdictions, health care provid￾ers should continue to monitor patients to identify children 
with a hyperinflammatory syndrome with shock and cardiac 
involvement. Suspected MIS-C patients should be reported 
to local and state health departments. Distinguishing patients 
with MIS-C from those with acute COVID-19 and other 
hyperinflammatory conditions is critical for early diagnosis 
and appropriate management. It is also critical for monitoring 
potential adverse events of a COVID-19 vaccine when one 
becomes widely available. Studies to define the clinical and 
laboratory characteristics of MIS-C should continue, includ￾ing identification of parameters that will help distinguish the 
illness from other similar conditions.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a rare 
but severe condition that has been reported approximately 
2–4 weeks after the onset of COVID-19 in children and adolescents.
What is added by this report?
Most cases of MIS-C have features of shock, with cardiac involve￾ment, gastrointestinal symptoms, and significantly elevated 
markers of inflammation, with positive laboratory test results for 
SARS-CoV-2. Of the 565 patients who underwent SARS-CoV-2 
testing, all had a positive test result by RT-PCR or serology.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Distinguishing MIS-C from other severe infectious or inflamma￾tory conditions poses a challenge to clinicians caring for 
children and adolescents. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues 
to expand in many jurisdictions, health care provider awareness 
of MIS-C will facilitate early recognition, early diagnosis, and 
prompt treatment.
