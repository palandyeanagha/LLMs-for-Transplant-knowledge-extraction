Abstract
Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is a technique that has developed as an adjunct to conventional ultrasound. CEUS offers a
number of benefits over conventional axial imaging with computerised tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, primarily
as a Bbeside^ test, without ionising radiation or the safety concerns associated with iodinated/gadolinium-based contrast agents.
Intravascular use of ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs) is widespread with extensive evidence for effective use. Despite this, the
potential utility of UCAs in physiological and non-physiological cavities has not been fully explored. The possibilities for
endocavitary uses of CEUS are described in this review based on a single-centre experience including CEUS technique and
utility in confirming drain placement, as well as within the biliary system, urinary system, gastrointestinal tract and intravascular
catheters.
Teaching Points
• CEUS offers an excellent safety profile, spatial resolution and is radiation free.
• Endocavitary CEUS provides real-time imaging similar to fluoroscopy in a portable setting.
• Endocavitary CEUS can define internal architecture of physiological cavities.
• Endocavitary CEUS can confirm drain position in physiological and non-physiological cavities.

Introduction
Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has developed as a
technique with increasing acceptance in recent years.
Although the most widespread use of CEUS has been in the
characterisation of focal liver lesions [1], many other uses
have been developed including renal, aortic, bowel and testic￾ular evaluation [2]. CEUS is expected to gain further popular￾ity following the recent Food and Drug Administration ap￾proval in the USA of Lumason™/SonoVue™ (Bracco,
Milan) for hepatic and paediatric hepatic use [3]. The rapidly
increasing myriad uses of CEUS have led to the development
of guidelines, issued by the European Federation and Society
of Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology (EFSUMB)
examining both hepatic and non-hepatic applications [1, 2].
These guidelines are based almost entirely on conventional
intravascular use. The EFSUMB guidelines do acknowledge
the use of ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs) in the assess￾ment of non-physiological cavities and state that in theory this
should be safe, based on the excellent safety profile from
intravascular use in both adults and paediatrics [4, 5].
Despite intra-cavitary usage being reported, the EFSUMB re￾frains from making recommendations other than use on a
case-by-case basis given the lack of experience in this area [2].
CEUS is an adjunctive technique to conventional B-mode
and Doppler ultrasound (US), giving rise to the term
multiparametric ultrasound (MPUS) [6]. The microbubble ul￾trasound contrast agent (UCA) most often used in Europe,
SonoVue™, consists of sulphur hexafluoride, an inert gas,
enveloped in a phospholipid shell and is a truly intravascular
agent with pulmonary excretion of the gas and hepatic clear￾ance of the phospholipid shell [7]. At low acoustic pressure
microbubbles resonate, giving rise to non-linear signals,
which are detected by modifications of the conventional ultra￾sound machine. Following cancellation of the linear signal

from normal tissue, the non-linear signal provides a contrast
image with dynamic assessment on a macro- and microvascu￾lar scale when used intravenously. These properties make
CEUS appropriate for endocavitary use, with excellent spatial
and temporal resolution in real time, akin to fluoroscopic im￾aging but without the need for iodinated contrast or ionising
radiation. There are also the traditional advantages of US im￾aging, including the ability to perform imaging at the bedside,
in immobile patients, particularly important in an intensive
care setting. As a result CEUS offers an alternative means of
dynamic imaging in the population potentially at increased
risk from conventional means such as paediatric patients, renal
failure patients and those for whom transport to a radiology
department would be impractical or unsafe. Many individual
case reports and case series on the utilisation of endocavitary
CEUS exist [8, 9], but there is no unifying technique or defin￾itive list of applications. Generally endocavitary CEUS is used
for confirming catheter drain placement, tracking the course of
a physiological or non-physiological cavity, identifying filling
defects and the presence of fistulation. This review article
aims to describe the myriad uses implemented in a single
centre and to consider the recent literature on the utility of
endocavitary CEUS.
Endocavitary CEUS technique
Endocavitary CEUS is a developing technique and a
methodology for general use remains undefined.
Conventionally intravenous use of CEUS requires
1.2 ml – 4.8 ml of SonoVue™ depending on the organ
or site examined. Endocavitary CEUS differs in that the
volume of the solvent, the fluid within a cavity, is much
smaller than the volume of circulating blood in the vas￾cular tree, and a considerably lower dose of UCA is
required. In vitro studies have shown SonoVue™ to be
stable in a diluted state providing sufficient backscatter
for endocavitary use [10]. In addition, the lack of
circulation of the UCA results in a greater degree of
stability, with the UCA estimated to remain within a
collection for up to 20–30 min [10, 11]. Prior feasibility
studies and case reports suggest 0.1 ml SonoVue™
diluted in 10-20 ml 0.9 % saline is sufficient for intra￾cavitary use, whilst for oral administration 1 drop of the
UCA is diluted in 50 ml water [11]. The authors use a
dilution of 0.1 ml SonoVue™ in 50 ml 0.9 % saline
routinely. The administered volume of the solution
varies on a case-by-case basis, as high-frequency linear
transducers may require higher concentrations of UCA,
given the optimal imaging for CEUS is 2–3 MHz [12].
For studies of the gastrointestinal tract where a larger
volume would be potentially needed, the ratio can be
extrapolated in up to 200 ml of solution.
Adverse reactions to intravenous CEUS have been rarely
described and UCAs have been shown to have an excellent
safety profile [4, 5]. Due to the absence of contact with the
systemic circulation, endocavitary CEUS is expected to have a
lower rate of adverse incidents, but this has not yet been prov￾en and access to resuscitation equipment must be considered
essential. Contraindications to endocavitary CEUS are not yet
available given that it is a technique in its infancy.
Contraindications to intravenous CEUS are severe cardiopul￾monary dysfunction and known hypersensitivity, whilst it has
been deemed preferable to avoid intravenous CEUS in preg￾nancy because of an absence of clinical data.
Endocavitary CEUS is performed following optimised
greyscale and Doppler imaging using contrast-specific soft￾ware with a low mechanical index (< 0.2). Either high fre￾quency linear transducers or a low frequency curvilinear trans￾ducer can be used for imaging with no adjustment of contrast
volume or concentration required.
Endocavitary uses
Intrauterine
One of the earliest recognised uses for endocavitary CEUS was
for evaluation of fallopian tube patency [13] (Fig. 1) and this
has been recognised by the National Institute of Clinical
Excellence (UK), leading its incorporation as an alternative to
the conventional fluoroscopic hysterosalpingogram (HSG).
This has led to a reduction in the implementation of diagnostic
laparoscopy and more efficient use of resources [14, 15]. A 100
% concordance has been found with traditional fluoroscopic
imaging with 97 % specificity and 82 % sensitivity [16] whilst
conferring no difference in patient discomfort. An alternative to
the traditional HSG is hysterosalpingosonography (HSS) con￾ventionally performed using agitated saline or air. However,
substituting an ultrasound contrast agent resulted in an increase
in diagnostic accuracy from 77 % to 85 % [13] by allowing
clear delineation of the uterine cavity and free flow of contrast
along the Fallopian tubes and peritoneal spill. A disadvantage
of hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography (HSCS) is the associ￾ated expense of the contrast agent and the EFSUMB guidelines
[2] suggest the use of HSCS over HSS only when the latter has
failed.
Fluid collections
Fluid collections are normally readily identifiable by US, with
a longstanding established indication for detection and
directing intervention. However complications of fluid collec￾tions can include difficulty establishing communications be￾tween multiple aspects, fistulation, and evaluation of size or
confirmation of catheter drain placement. When clinically
304 Insights Imaging (2018) 9:303–311

warranted to evaluate the collection further, contrast-enhanced
fluoroscopic imaging may be required or more often static
imaging with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic reso￾nance (MR) imaging is needed; conventional US may not be
able to provide sufficient information. CEUS often adds an￾other dimension to the baseline US examination. Explorations
of endocavitary use of CEUS via in-dwelling pigtail catheter
drains including for loculated ascites, pleural drains and liver
abscess drains have been performed. Invariably, the drain po￾sition can be readily confirmed as the dilute UCA is adminis￾tered and disperses within the collection but is contained with￾in the loculation of the collection (Fig. 2). The excellent res￾olution of endocavitary CEUS allows visualisation of solitary
microbubbles and can confirm communication between

seemingly disconnected elements (Fig. 3) or potentially
fistulation. Conversely loculation of the contained elements
indicating a solitary catheter drain would be unsuccessful for
complete drainage (Fig. 3). As the UCA remains in a non￾circulating cavity the contrast persists for up to 20 min
allowing time for detailed evaluation [10, 11].
Biliary tract
Intraluminal evaluation of the biliary tree is limited and con￾ventionally is best performed by either magnetic resonance
cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) or fluoroscopic cholangi￾ography via a percutaneous approach or a nasobiliary tube.
Cholangiography is often performed alongside an intervention
such as placement of a biliary drain or stent. Injection of UCA
is able to delineate the biliary ducts by opacifiying these ducts
with contrast and can potentially identify strictures, leaks or
the drain position (Fig. 4). In a study of 12 patients it was
suggested that endocavitary CEUS could be used as a bedside
tool, but conventional fluoroscopic imaging via T-tube chol￾angiography was superior [17]. Further studies have shown
that intrabiliary endocavitary CEUS is useful for visualisation
of an in-dwelling drain tip, with only 54 % seen on conven￾tional US B-mode imaging but 100 % seen with endocavitary
CEUS. In addition, intra-biliary CEUS was 96 % accurate for
diagnosing a stenotic rather than fully occlusive stricture, cor￾responding to other studies performed [18]; however abnor￾malities of the biliary tree are often inadequately visualised,
such as irregularities suggestive of sclerosing cholangitis [11].
Daneshi et al. utilised the truly intraluminal nature of UCA to
delineate a biliary-vascular fistula as UCA administered via an
in-dwelling biliary drain resulted in parenchymal enhance￾ment [8]. Formal studies comparing MRCP to endocavitary
CEUS in the biliary system have not been conducted.

Urinary tract
Ultrasound contrast agents have been shown to be safe within
the urinary collecting system in a number of studies of vesico￾ureteric reflux in children replicating the low rate of adverse
reactions seen with intravenous use, none of which were clas￾sified as any more than minor in nature [19]. Currently iden￾tification of vesico-ureteric reflux is the only approved appli￾cation of endocavitary contrast-enhanced ultrasound, follow￾ing large trials of safety and diagnostic accuracy [20]. The
technique utilises UCA instilled into the bladder and the op￾erator performs sonography in micturition to identify reflux
into the ureters and kidneys (Fig. 5). Contrast-enhanced
vesico-ureteric reflux studies have been demonstrated to be
comparable to conventional fluoroscopic imaging for grading
of vesicoureteric reflux in > 90 % of cases [21]. It is accepted
that there is a considerable learning curve for this technique
and the usual limitations of ultrasound apply, e.g. body habi￾tus, patient compliance. In addition, there is a need to use
dilute UCA to prevent acoustic shadowing obscuring the

retrovesical ureters, a recognised reason for under-diagnosis
of low-grade reflux when using contrast-enhanced voiding
ultrasonography. Administration of an UCA via an in￾dwelling catheter in adult patients can also allow for bladder
assessment. Although no reports exist, endocavitary CEUS
cystography may have a potential role in evaluating filling
defects (Fig. 6) or possibly evaluation of vesical fistulae.
Following percutaneous nephrostomy insertion, it is fre￾quently necessary to assess the renal collecting system and
ureter for free passage of contrast prior to removal of the catheter
to ensure patency. The stent patency, point of obstruction or
relief of a prior obstructing aetiology can all be assessed
(Fig. 7); contrast imaging of the ureters also allows for the
delineation of a fistula or ureteric rupture. The spatial resolution
of endocavitary CEUS allows for a confident assessment of free
ureteric drainage. Recent studies demonstrate 79-100% concor￾dance with flouroscopy, with 94% of disconcordant cases show￾ing ureteric patency on CEUS nephrostogram which was not

seen on conventional flouroscopy [9, 22]. In an acute setting
UCA injected via a needle entering a renal collecting system can
be used as an alternative to fluoroscopic imaging enabling con￾fident bedside nephrostomy placement. This percutaneous
puncture may be facilitated by placing a small volume of
UCA on a puncture needle and watching as the UCA refluxes
back along the needle as a calyceal puncture is achieved because
of back pressure of urine [23] (Fig. 8).
Bowel
Trans-abdominal US of the bowel has developed as a tech￾nique, and oral solution can be used as a negative contrast
agent within the bowel to examine the lumen for evidence of
filling defects or complications of inflammatory bowel dis￾ease, whilst simultaneous intravenous UCA can allow assess￾ment of the bowel wall [24, 25]. Ultrasound contrast agents
have been shown to be stable in the gastric cavity and can be
used to allow assessment within the bowel lumen and bowel
wall. UCA fills the bowel lumen in a similar way to fluoros￾copy, allowing assessment for wall thickening and irregulari￾ties; however this may be non-specific particularly in the con￾text of an unprepared bowel. There is a paucity of literature on
the use of orally administered UCA, but this has included the
assessment of gastrointestinal reflux (Fig. 9), whilst in combi￾nation with intravenous CEUS may help in the detection of
neoplasia [26]. To date there have been no comparative stud￾ies of MR enterography and endocavitary CEUS.
Gastrostomy and jejunostomy tubes may be placed endo￾scopically or radiologically, and complications arise, specifi￾cally in relation to ‘misplacement’. Even when anchored with
a catheter balloon or a Bmushroom cage^ [27], these tubes can
become dislodged in daily activity leading to leakage and
infection. Ultrasound contrast agents administered via the tube
can confirm correct placement, exclude extravasation and al￾low assessment of the regional bowel for peristaltic abnormal￾ity or wall thickening (Fig. 10).

Vascular lines
Linograms are a common procedure performed in the fluoros￾copy suite to ensure an in-dwelling catheter has not become
dislodged or potentially damaged (Fig. 11). Most frequently
the procedure is performed in patients in whom vascular ac￾cess is difficult and there is reluctance for line removal such as
long-term Bporta-caths^ or in paedatric patients. Confirmation
of a misplaced line warrants line removal, which may involve
a general anaesthetic in paediatric patients. Ultrasound con￾trast agents injected through a line should result in systemic
vascular opacification confirming correct placement of the tip,
similar to conventional fluoroscopic investigation. Further
complications of line placement may also be assessed includ￾ing the presence of thrombus surrounding a line, as evidenced
by lack of vascular enhancement. The lumen of the line itself
also often lies superficially and can be assessed for the pres￾ence of rupture using a high frequency transducer, particularly
important in the presence of focal tenderness (Fig. 11).
Limitations
Endocavitary CEUS has limitations. Traditional factors that hin￾der ultrasound remain a factor in endocavitary CEUS and may
include body habitus, bowel gas and operator skill. In addition, it
is important to use larger volumes of UCA solution in
endocavitary use to prevent pooling of contrast, rather than dy￾namic free diffusion, within a space that may not have any active
flow movement. At the same time the volume of UCA must be
reduced to prevent artefact from excessive signal, which can lead
to loss of detail and posterior acoustic shadowing. In the
experience of the authors the same concentration can be utilised
regardless of whether a high frequency linear or curvilinear trans￾ducer is used. A further limiting factor is the ability to access the
targeted cavity. Often this is via an invasive technique (e.g.
nephrostomy, biliary drainage or catheterisation); the additional
procedural risk may not be preferable. The invasive element and
the recent development of endocavitary CEUS mean direct com￾parative studies with non-invasive techniques have not been per￾formed in many areas such as with MR imaging. The dynamic
nature of the studies involved, however, likens endocavitary
CEUS more to fluoroscopy but without the need for a dedicated
suite or use of radiation.
Conclusion
Conventional CEUS is a technique gaining rapid popularity
owing to its excellent safety profile, spatial and temporal res￾olution whilst also being portable and free of ionising radia￾tion. Extrapolation of traditional intravascular use of CEUS
allows for a range of endocavitary CEUS uses in diagnostic
radiology particularly for the assessment of drain positions
and evaluation of loculation, strictures and fistulae. The de￾tailed resolution and real-time imaging also allow for myriad
interventional uses of endocavitary CEUS.
Endocavitary CEUS is a novel technique and offers a dynam￾ic modality assessment in real time, with operator discretion for
visualisation of specified anatomy. The size of UCA
microbubbles combined with both exquisite temporal and spatial
resolution means it is ideally suited to endoluminal delineation
with uses described above in the biliary and collecting systems as

well as established intrauterine use and utility in interventional
radiology. Experimental use for non-physiological cavities, vas￾cular lines and bowel implementations have been performed at
our institution and, although feasible, formal studies have not yet
been conducted despite anecdotal benefit, as befits a new
technique.
