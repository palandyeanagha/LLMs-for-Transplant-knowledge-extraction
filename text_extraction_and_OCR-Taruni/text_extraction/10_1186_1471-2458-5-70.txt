Abstract
Background: Each year in the United States, an estimated 40,000 children are born with
congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, causing an estimated 400 deaths and leaving
approximately 8000 children with permanent disabilities such as hearing or vision loss, or mental
retardation. More children are affected by serious CMV-related disabilities than by several better￾known childhood maladies, including Down syndrome, fetal alcohol syndrome, and spina bifida.
Discussion: Congenital CMV is a prime target for prevention not only because of its substantial
disease burden but also because the biology and epidemiology of CMV suggest that there are ways
to reduce viral transmission. Because exposure to the saliva or urine of young children is a major
cause of CMV infection among pregnant women, it is likely that good personal hygiene, especially
hand-washing, can reduce the risk of CMV acquisition. Experts agree that such measures are likely
to be efficacious (i.e., they will work if consistently followed) and the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that physicians counsel pregnant women about
preventing CMV acquisition through careful attention to hygiene. However, because of concerns
about effectiveness (i.e., Will women consistently follow hygienic practices as the result of
interventions?), the medical and public health communities appear reluctant to embrace primary
CMV prevention via improved hygienic practices, and educational interventions are rare. Current
data on the effectiveness of such measures in preventing CMV infection are promising, but limited.
There is strong evidence, however, that educational interventions can prevent other infectious
diseases with similar transmission modes, suggesting that effective interventions can also be found
for CMV. Until a CMV vaccine becomes available, effective educational interventions are needed
to inform women about congenital CMV prevention.
Summary: Perhaps no single cause of birth defects and developmental disabilities in the United
States currently provides greater opportunity for improved outcomes in more children than
congenital CMV. Given the present state of knowledge, women deserve to be informed about how
they can reduce their risk of CMV infection during pregnancy, and trials are needed to identify
effective educational interventions.

Background
The history of public health in twentieth century America
is replete with successes in the prevention of birth defects
and childhood disabilities. Vaccines have virtually elimi￾nated polio, congenital rubella syndrome, and Haemo￾philus influenzae meningitis [1-3]. Educational efforts
aimed at preventing fetal alcohol syndrome have reduced
maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy [4]. Pre￾natal vitamins and folic acid fortification of cereals have
lowered rates of neural tube defects [5], while antiretrovi￾ral treatments have caused the occurrence of mother-to￾child human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission
to plummet [6]. Notably absent from the list of successes,
however, is the prevention of congenital cytomegalovirus
(CMV) disease [7].
Perhaps no single cause of birth defects and developmen￾tal disabilities in the United States currently provides
greater opportunity for improved outcomes in more chil￾dren than congenital CMV. Each year in the United States,
an estimated 40,000 children are born with congenital
CMV infection, causing an estimated 400 deaths and leav￾ing approximately 8000 children with permanent disabil￾ities such as hearing or vision loss, or mental retardation
[8]. The direct annual economic costs of caring for these
children are estimated at $1-$2 billion [8,9]. More chil￾dren are adversely affected by congenital CMV disease
than by several better-known childhood diseases or syn￾dromes (Figure 1). Congenital CMV is a prime target for
prevention not only because of its substantial disease bur￾den but also because the biology and epidemiology of
CMV suggest that there are ways to reduce viral transmis￾sion. Unfortunately, by missing prevention opportunities,
we in the medical and public health communities are
washing our hands of the congenital CMV disease
epidemic.
CMV and congenital CMV disease
As with other human herpesviruses, initial infection by
CMV (also known as primary infection) is followed by the
establishment of lifelong latent infection, from which
periodic reactivation is common [10,11]. Symptoms are
usually absent during primary infection and reactivation,
but CMV is shed in various bodily secretions, particularly

urine and saliva [12]. CMV excretion can be continuous or
intermittent, generally lasting several weeks in adults but
often continuing for months or years in young children
[13-15]. CMV infection is widespread, with estimates of
CMV seroprevalence in the United States ranging from
40% to 80% [16-18].
CMV is transmitted person-to-person via close non-sexual
contact, sexual activity, breastfeeding, blood transfusions,
and organ transplantation [12]. CMV has not been shown
to be transmitted via respiratory secretions or aerosolized
virus. For the pregnant woman, the most likely source of
infection may be contact with the urine or saliva of young
children, especially her own children [19,20].
Congenital CMV disease is most likely to occur following
a primary infection in the mother. Primary infections
occur in 1%-4% of seronegative, pregnant women and
lead to fetal infection in 40%-50% of these pregnancies.
Maternal CMV reactivation or reinfection with a different
CMV strain leads to fetal infection in about 1% of serop￾ositive, pregnant women. Approximately 10% of congen￾itally infected infants are symptomatic at birth, and of the
90% who are asymptomatic, 10%-15% will develop
symptoms over months or even years (Figure 2) [21]. Per￾manent sequelae can result from CMV infection of the
fetus during any trimester, but infection during early fetal
development is likely to be especially damaging [22,23].
Since few newborns are screened for CMV, the true impact
of congenital CMV infection is underappreciated.
Discussion
Reducing the burden of congenital CMV disease
Of all the ways to fight congenital CMV disease, the devel￾opment of a vaccine is viewed as the most promising.
Considerable progress has been made over the last 30
years, but insufficient interest by vaccine manufacturers
(Stanley Plotkin, personal communication) and technical
challenges make it is uncertain when a vaccine will
become available [24]. Avenues for improving outcomes
in congenitally infected children have also been explored,
including anti-CMV therapies (e.g., ganciclovir) for seri￾Transient and permanent outcomes among Figure 2 children with congenital CMV disease

ously infected infants [25,26] and supportive care, such as
hearing screening, language therapy, and special educa￾tion [27,28]. In contrast, insufficient emphasis has been
given to preventing CMV infection in pregnant women.
While women may be infected via several routes, the
remainder of this article focuses on preventing transmis￾sion via the important child-to-mother route, by encour￾aging hygienic practices such as frequent hand washing.
A number of experts have suggested that women be edu￾cated about hygienic practices for preventing CMV trans￾mission from young children, and there is little dispute
over what the prevention guidelines should entail (Figure
3) [7,11,29-32]. This consensus is reflected in current
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists
guidelines, which recommend that physicians counsel
pregnant women about preventing CMV acquisition
through careful attention to hygiene [33]. Nevertheless,
hygienic practices do not appear to be widely discussed by
healthcare providers and prospective mothers are often
unaware of both CMV disease and the potential benefits
of hygienic practices. The virtual absence of a prevention
message has been due, in part, to the low profile of con￾genital CMV. Infection is usually asymptomatic in both
mother and infant, and when symptoms do occur, they
are non-specific, so most CMV infections go undiagnosed.
The prevention message has also been hindered by a sense
that infection is unavoidable. For example, a number of
authors have urged prevention education for women on
the one hand but on the other hand, they have noted that
"CMV is neither preventable nor treatable..."[34],"...it is
not certain that infections in pregnant women can be pre￾vented by avoiding exposure" [35], "...it is doubtful
whether parents will comply with these [behavioral meas￾ures in nonstudy settings..." [36], "...there is very little evi￾dence for the efficacy of these strategies and even less for
their practical implementation...", and "The only effective
prevention strategy relies upon the development of a vac￾cine." [37] Given the relative invisibility of CMV disease
and these mixed messages about prevention education, it
is not surprising that healthcare providers do not discuss
CMV with their patients and that women are unaware of
the risks of CMV infection.
Preventing CMV infection through hygienic practices
Why the ambivalence toward hygienic practices? Studies
have shown that transmission of CMV via the urine and
saliva of children is a major cause of infection among
Hygienic practices to reduce risk of Figure 3 CMV infection for women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant
Hygienic practices to reduce risk of CMV infection for women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. When inter￾acting with young children, women should assume the children are secreting CMV in their urine and saliva.
• Thoroughly wash hands with soap and warm water after activities such as: 
- Diaper changes 
- Feeding or bathing child 
- Wiping child’s runny nose or drool 
- Handling child’s toys 
• Do not share cups, plates, utensils, toothbrushes, or food 
• Do not kiss on or near the mouth 
• Do not share towels or washcloths 
• Clean toys, countertops and other surfaces that come in contact with urine 
or saliva.

pregnant women [19,20]. In addition, more than 100
years of evidence conclusively demonstrates that hand
washing reduces risk of infection for a wide range of path￾ogens [38]. Thus, nearly everyone would agree that, in the￾ory, hand washing can prevent CMV infection because
hands are an important vehicle for transmission. The con￾cern, then, is not the efficacy of hygienic practices (i.e.,
Will they work if consistently followed?) but, instead, the
effectiveness of interventions to promote them (i.e., Will
women consistently follow hygienic practices as the result
of interventions?).
It is important to recognize the implications of the con￾sensus that hygienic practices are efficacious for prevent￾ing CMV transmission. Individual women have the right
to know that, under ideal conditions, risk of child-to￾mother CMV transmission can be reduced by proper hygi￾enic practices. This is equivalent to the ethical obligation
to inform individuals that, under ideal conditions, safer
sexual practices will reduce the risk of acquiring HIV. This
obligation is independent of whether any particular edu￾cational program or intervention is effective. All women
of childbearing age, whether they are CMV seropositive or
seronegative, carry some risk of new CMV infection during
pregnancy and thus should be informed of hygienic prac￾tices that reduce that risk. As Revello and Gerna aptly
remind us, "...withholding information on possible med￾ical interventions is unethical (and legally risky)" [39].
The terrible burden of congenital CMV disease (Figure 1)
should make the provision of such information a priority.
As there is consensus on the efficacy of hygienic practices
in preventing CMV transmission, the next step is to evalu￾ate the effectiveness of educational interventions in pre￾venting CMV transmission. Current evidence of
effectiveness is promising, but limited. In one study, after
non-pregnant women were educated about CMV preven￾tion, hygienic practices improved [40]. In a small study of
Houston families, Demmler and colleagues found that
behavioral changes prevented transmission of CMV
(unpublished report described in Yow and Demmler [7]).
Adler and colleagues studied the effectiveness of hygienic
practices in a randomized, controlled trial of 39 seroneg￾ative, non-pregnant women with young children who
were shedding CMV [31]. Although the study was under￾powered to detect significant differences in infection rates
between the intervention and control groups (and thus
the intervention was deemed unsuccessful by some), sero￾conversion rates decreased as CMV education and support
increased. Furthermore, in the same study, 14 pregnant
women were educated regarding hygienic practices and
then followed for comparison with the randomized
groups; none of the women seroconverted – a significant
difference compared with the randomized groups. A more
recent study also reported that pregnant women who
received an intervention involving hygienic practices were
significantly less likely to acquire CMV infection than
were non-pregnant women [41].
More conclusive evidence of effectiveness can be found in
the literature on community-based interventions for the
prevention of other infectious diseases with similar trans￾mission modes. For example, a meta-analysis found that
community intervention trials that encouraged washing
hands with soap reduced the risk of diarrheal diseases by
47% [42]. Hand-washing programs reduced respiratory
illness among military recruits [43] and children in day￾care [44], and interventions involving hand sanitizers
reduced absenteeism among elementary school teachers
and children [45]. An in-depth review of the literature
would be useful for determining the key factors associated
with the success of these and other community
interventions.
Although all women of childbearing age deserve to be
informed about CMV, interventions for preventing CMV
transmission are most likely to be effective for pregnant
women, who tend to be highly motivated, often changing
behavior to protect the health of their developing fetuses.
As a case in point, 25% of low-income smokers spontane￾ously quit smoking during pregnancy [46]; this percent￾age is higher than that achieved by most smoking
cessation programs [47]. Studies by Adler and colleagues
suggest that motivation for avoiding CMV infection is
considerably higher among pregnant than non-pregnant
women [31,41].
In sum, the evidence to date gives every indication that
effective interventions can be found for preventing CMV
infection among pregnant women. Thus, the paradigm
must shift from wondering whether such interventions
will be effective to developing and evaluating interven￾tions until effective ones are identified.
Next steps
Given the consequences of allowing the congenital CMV
disease epidemic to continue unabated, it is imperative
that women receive the educational message about con￾genital CMV disease prevention (see http://www.cdc.gov/
cmv) [48]. Promotion of this message could translate
years of careful CMV research into an immediate public
health benefit. Encouraging hygienic practices would be
relatively inexpensive (requires no laboratory testing or
additional doctor visits), ethically responsible (allows
women to make informed decisions), and likely to pre￾vent disabilities and save lives. Based on studies of the
economic impact of future CMV vaccines, which estimate
savings of $50,000 per quality adjusted life-year saved [8],
it is likely that CMV education efforts would provide a
highly favorable cost-benefit ratio as well. CMV educa-

tional messages should emphasize hygienic practices as a
precaution for all women who are pregnant or planning to
become pregnant, and reasonable but not extreme meas￾ures for minimizing risk during interactions with young
children (Figure 3). In many instances, a CMV education
message could build upon and strengthen other public
health messages about infection prevention through
improved hand hygiene. Once effective hand-hygiene
messages are identified, more ambitious goals might also
be considered, such as prevention of sexual transmission
or transmission between children in daycare.
Enlisting the support of healthcare providers to convey
the gravity of CMV infection and the importance of good
hygienic practices is crucial. Healthcare providers have
many opportunities to provide women with such infor￾mation, such as during annual gynecological exams or
well-baby visits as women accompany their children to
the pediatrician's office. Other steps, such as community
education by healthcare providers (including information
sessions with daycare directors, daycare providers, and
parents) and provision of information by the Public
Health Service and other professional organizations, can
supplement the healthcare provider's information [49].
Success in delivering the message will depend on the
active involvement of all relevant healthcare
professionals.
In addition, trials are needed to identify effective commu￾nity-based interventions for preventing CMV transmis￾sion to pregnant women. These trials will be important for
quantifying the effectiveness of the proposed hygienic
practices and for assessing the proportion of CMV infec￾tions that result from child-to-mother transmission as
opposed to other routes, such as sexual transmission.
However, such trials should not delay nor hinder the edu￾cational effort, just as we would not wait to inform skydiv￾ers about the prudence of parachute use because the
results of controlled trials are not yet in. "As with many
interventions intended to prevent ill health, the effective￾ness of parachutes has not been subjected to rigorous eval￾uation by using randomised controlled trials...[One
option] is that we accept that, under exceptional circumstances,
common sense might be applied when considering the potential
risks and benefits of interventions [our emphasis]."[50]
Common sense tells us that avoiding CMV-laden secre￾tions will prevent transmission and that the potential ben￾efits of educational interventions far outweigh the
potential risks.
Although an effective CMV vaccine would be ideal and
vaccine development deserves increased support, hope for
a vaccine tomorrow should not stand in the way of a vig￾orous educational message today. Prevention through
improved hygienic practices will not be easy, but washing
our hands of the problem by staying the present course
guarantees that each year in the United States, hundreds
of children will die and thousands of others will swell the
ranks of CMV-affected children growing up with serious
disabilities. Just as the medical and public health commu￾nities are successfully meeting the challenges posed by
polio, rubella, HIV, and neural tube defects, now is the
time to meet the congenital CMV challenge head on by
making awareness and prevention high priorities.
Summary
• Each year in the United States, congenital CMV
- causes an estimated 400 deaths
- leaves more than 8000 children with permanent disabil￾ities such as hearing or vision loss, or mental retardation
• Exposure to the saliva or urine of young children is a
major cause of CMV infection among pregnant women.
• Risk of CMV infection is likely to be reduced by careful
attention to good personal hygiene, especially hand￾washing.
• Women should be informed about how to reduce their
risk of CMV infection during pregnancy.
• Trials are needed to identify educational interventions
that are effective in preventing CMV infection.
