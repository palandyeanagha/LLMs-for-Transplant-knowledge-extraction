COVID-19 and sport
With risk of cardiological, renal, respi￾ratory and haematological complica￾tions,1–5 it is best practice to follow steady 
resumption of training, paying attention 
to physical and psychological factors after 
COVID-19 infection.
Scope of this infographic
This guidance takes into account public 
health guidelines in the UK (although we 
hope its content is relevant more widely) 
and available expert opinion at time of 
publication and is for use by healthcare 
practitioners. It is applicable to perfor￾mance athletes who have had mild to 
moderate illness. Those requiring hospital 
admission merit further assessment.
COVID-19 clinical guidance
If an athlete develops an illness with 
symptoms of COVID-19, they should 
follow national guidance, speak to their 
sports medicine doctor, and undertake 
appropriate quarantine, testing and 
tracing.
They should maintain good hydration, 
a balanced diet and, if symptoms worsen 
or persist beyond 7 days, seek further 
medical review.
Quarantine when living with others 
includes practical aspects such as isolating 
within rooms not accessed by other 
persons, maintaining supplies of food and 
water, use of a different toilet and washing 
dirty linen and clothes regularly.
Graduated return to play (GRTP) 
protocol
A GRTP is a progressive programme that 
introduces physical activity and sport in a 
stepwise fashion.
Key considerations
► Before considering GRTP, the athlete 
must be able to complete activities 
of daily living and walk 500m on 
the flat without excessive fatigue or 
breathlessness.
► They should have at least 10 days’ rest 
and be 7 days symptom-free before 
starting.
► Less aerobically intense sports like 
golf may progress quicker. Experience 
suggests that some athletes take over 
3weeks to recover.
Some monitoring may add value, which 
could includes
► Resting heart rate.
► Rated perceived exertion.
► Sleep, stress, fatigue and muscle 
soreness.
► Injury-Psychological Readiness to 
Return to Sport.
If any symptoms occur (including exces￾sive fatigue) while going through GRTP, the 
athlete must return to the previous stage 
and progress again after a minimum of 
24hours’ period of rest without symptoms.
Athletes with comorbidities
Athletes diagnosed with COVID-19 and 
who have medical conditions such as 
diabetes, cardiovascular disease or renal 
disease should have a medical assessment 
before commencing GRTP.
Further assessments
Athletes who have a complicated or 
prolonged COVID-19 illness may need 
further investigations, including
