Fifty years since the first successful human heart transplant from a non-heart beating donor, this concept of 
heart transplantation from donation after circulatory determined death (DCD) promises to be one of the 
most exciting developments in heart transplantation. Heart transplantation has established itself as the best 
therapeutic option for patients with end-stage heart failure, with the opportunity to provide these patients 
with a near-normal quality of life. However, this treatment is severely limited by the availability of suitable 
donor hearts. In recent times, heart transplantation has been limited to using donor hearts from donors 
following brain stem death. The use of donor hearts from DCD had been thought to be associated with high 
risk and poor outcomes until recent developments in organ perfusion and retrieval techniques have shown 
that this valuable resource may provide an answer to the global shortage of suitable donor hearts. With 
established DCD heart transplant programmes reporting encouraging results, this technique has been shown 
to be comparable to the current gold standard of donation after brain death (DBD) heart transplantation.

Introduction
Heart transplantation worldwide has been accepted as the 
best treatment for patients with medically refractory end 
stage heart failure. Recent data from the International 
Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation from 1982 to 
2014 including data on more than 100,000 heart transplants 
show continuously improving median survival with patients 
from 2002–2008 benefitting from a median survival of 
11.9 years (1). Despite being such an effective therapy, its 
utilization is limited by the short supply of suitable donor 
hearts. In the United Kingdom (UK), only 27% of hearts 
from donors following brain stem death [donation after 
brain death (DBD)] that are offered are eventually accepted 
for transplantation. Unfortunately, this translates to 43% of 
patients on the heart transplant waiting list either dying or 
becoming too sick to be suitable for a heart transplant (1).
To a d d r e s s t h e i n c r e a s i n g d e m a n d f o r h e a r t 
transplantation, the heart transplant community were forced 
not only to extend the acceptability criteria for DBD hearts 
but also to re-explore heart transplantation using hearts 
from donation after circulatory determined death (DCD). 
Until recently, anxieties concerning the unquantifiable 
warm ischemic injury to the myocardium following cardiac 
arrest coupled with the inability to assess function of the 
asystolic heart have been major hurdles preventing further 
attempts at transplanting DCD hearts. However, with 
advances in technology, research and the desperate need 
for suitable donor hearts, successful DCD heart transplant 
programmes have been established with very encouraging 
results to date.
The potential for DCD heart donation
Donor shortage is not limited to cardiac transplantation 
alone. Despite early transplantation being largely from 
DCD, the mainstay of transplantation has been from DBD. 
It has only been since the end of the century following the 

76 Page et al. Heart transplantation from DCD

definition of the categories of DCD by the International 
Congress on Non-Heart Beating Donation that transplant 
programmes have seriously considered DCD organs to 
expand the donor pool (2,3). 
Renal transplantation has led the way with the use 
of DCD transplantation in the modern era with early 
experiences in the 1990s suggesting a 20% increase in kidney 
transplantation as a result of the use of DCD organs (4). 
In the UK, DCD kidney transplantation has expanded 
from around 100 DCD kidney transplants per annum in 
2003/04 to over 800 in 2013/14 accounting for an overall 
40% of deceased donor renal transplantation (5). In the 
UK, DCD organ donation from Maastricht category III 
donors contributed to 32% of all organs transplanted from 
deceased donors in 2016–2017 (6).
A retrospective review of the UK transplant registry data 
held by NHS Blood and Transplant over a 3-year period from 
2011 to 2013, revealed that of 3,073 DCD donors referred, 
149 (5%) would be potential DCD heart donors (7). In this 
analysis, DCD donors referred were considered unsuitable 
for heart donation based on lack of appropriate consent, age 
over 50 years, cardiac arrest in the donor, a cardiac cause 
of death, cardiac risk factors, cardiovascular disease, the 
use of any inotropes in the donor and a functional warm 
ischemic time (FWIT) of greater than 30 minutes. FWIT 
is defined as the time from when the systolic blood pressure 
of the donor reaches 50 mmHg following withdrawal of life 
supporting therapy (WLST) till mechanical asystole. The 
time limit of 30 minutes for FWIT is adopted from that 
used by abdominal transplant surgeons. However, there 
has been well established small and large animal models to 
suggest that heart would be tolerant to 30 minutes of warm 
ischemia (8). Although the application of this criteria is more 
stringent than the current protocols applied to DCD heart 
transplantation in the UK, this conservative projection would 
have translated to at least a 30% increase in heart transplant 
activity over the same period.
Animal models of DCD heart donation
There have been a number of animal models of DCD heart 
transplantation that have been explored.
The Japanese group experimented on a canine model 
using exsanguination as a mode of death, antemortem 
conditioning followed by in situ machine perfusion and 
cooling to 20 ℃ prior to heart retrieval and cold storage (9). 
They were able to wean the hearts of cardiopulmonary 
bypass in a recipient model in this series. However, there 
are a number of issues in translating this into practice in the 
UK. First antemortem interventions are not allowed in the 
UK and such pre-conditioning of the donor heart prior to 
death would not be possible. Secondly, this method does 
not allow for functional assessment of the donor organ on 
its own. However, this method showed that cold storage 
of DCD hearts with evidence of myocardial viability post￾transplantation might be a potential strategy.
Gundry et al., used a hypoxic lamb model with ante￾mortem pre-conditioning prior to DCD heart retrieval (10). 
Implantation was performed with the recipient cooled to 
20 ℃. In his initial experiments, the time from withdrawal 
to donation was limited to less than 21 minutes with cold 
storage time less than 2 hours. Here again, no functional 
assessment was possible, and success might be attributed to 
the short warm and cold ischemic times. 
Gundry then proceeded to extend the period of 
warm ischemia to 30 minutes using a combination of 
pharmacological pre- and post-conditioning agents and 
replicated this success in a primate model, limiting cold 
static storage to 60 minutes (11). 
The use of normothermic regional perfusion, originating 
from Barnard’s clinical work, was explored by Ali et al. using 
a porcine model of hypoxic induced DCD (12). Following 
death, cardio-pulmonary bypass was established and after 
allowing for a period of less than hour with the heart off￾loaded and allowed to recover, bypass was weaned and 
the heart functionally assessed using load independent 
contractility. This suggested that the DCD heart maintains 
viability and recovers function similar to that of the BSD 
heart and may be suitable for clinical transplantation. This 
was also confirmed in the human setting where a DCD 
heart was able to be successfully weaned off normo-thrmic 
regional perfusion (NRP) and support the circulation 
suggesting that DCD hearts were indeed functionally 
suitable for transplantation (13). 
The history of human DCD heart donation
The first adult heart transplant in the world that was 
performed by Barnard at the Groote Schuur Hospital in 
1967 was from a DCD donor (14). The donor had been 
involved in a road traffic collision and sustained severe 
traumatic brain injury. Brain stem testing was not legally 
recognised at the time and so DCD was the only available 
option. Following WLST, the donor arrested and death was 
declared 5 minutes after electrical asystole. The donor was 
then systemically heparinized and initially placed on cardio-

pulmonary bypass. Following this, perfusion was limited to 
the heart while it was cooled. In this setting, the recipient 
was co-located and the heart retrieved without cardioplegia 
followed by continuous antegrade coronary blood perfusion. 
However, following the publication of the accepted 
definition of brain death, heart transplantation shifted 
towards DBD donors (15). It was only in 2004 that 
attention was drawn to the potential for DCD for cardiac 
transplantation in the pediatric population in a bid to 
reduce the unacceptably high waiting list mortality (16). 
The work by Gundry et al. (11) formed the basis of the 
techniques used by the team in Denver, Colorado when 
embarking on their clinical programme of paediatric DCD 
heart transplantation (17). Here they utilized a system of 
ante-mortem heparinization and cannulation, together with 
co-location of the donor and recipient. Additionally, they 
limited the time from mechanical asystole to confirmation 
of death to 75 seconds whereas in the UK it is a mandatory 
5 minutes. These strategies were employed to decrease the 
cold ischemic time and are considered to attribute to the 
success of this strategy.
However, the success of these techniques relied on 
antemortem interventions and a short cold ischemic time 
which could only be achieved by collocating the donor and 
recipient. Furthermore, this did not allow for functional 
assessment of the heart following the hypoxic insult of 
circulatory death till after implantation in the recipient
However, wider acceptance of DCD heart donation was 
reported in 2015 following the transplantation of three 
adult DCD hearts in Sydney using direct procurement and 
perfusion (DPP) (18). This technique involves removing 
the asystolic heart and reanimating the organ upon an 
ex-situ perfusion platform [TransMedics Organ Care 
System (OCS), Andover, MA, USA)] (19). Unfortunately, 
heart function could not be assessed using this technique. 
It was therefore thought by many that without a functional 
assessment prior to transplantation this would place the 
recipient at unacceptably high risk of primary graft failure 
as post-operative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation 
(ECMO) support was reported at 30%. This limited the 
team to donors less than 40 years old and a donation 
withdrawal ischemic time to less than 30 minutes.
In 2015, Papworth Hospital performed the world’s 
first DCD heart transplant using functional assessment of 
the donor heart through the technique of normothermic 
regional perfusion. This technique allowed re-perfusion 
of the heart and abdominal viscera within the donor with 
the exclusion of the cerebral circulation. This permitted 
functional assessment of the donor heart in situ allowing the 
team to extend donor age up to 50 years and the donation 
withdrawal ischemic time to 247 minutes.
Techniques of DCD heart retrieval 
There are three techniques for procurement of DCD 
cardiac allografts that are practiced in the UK: (I) 
normothermic regional perfusion followed by ex-situ
machine perfusion (NRP); (II) DPP; (III) normothermic 
regional perfusion followed by cold storage.
Following the planned withdrawal of life-supporting 
therapy which is carried out by the local anesthetic or 
intensive care independent of the retrieval in the adjoining 
anesthetic room or closely situated intensive care unit, 
the donor is monitored by the local team. Following the 
identification of mechanical asystole, a hands-off period 
of 5 minutes is allowed prior to the declaration of death 
in keeping with the guidance in the UK as published by 
the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges (20). Once death 
is confirmed the donor is promptly transferred to the 
operating room where the retrieval teams are scrubbed in 
preparation for organ retrieval. 
Normothermic regional perfusion
Following the declaration of death, the patient is brought 
into the operating room and draped for thoraco-abdominal 
organ retrieval. A median sternotomy is performed first 
with prompt administration of heparin into the right atrium 
and pulmonary artery. Tracheal re-intubation is carried 
out simultaneously. The aortic arch vessels are clamped 
to exclude cerebral circulation as per the guidelines of 
organ retrieval in the UK (20). The aorta and right atrium 
are cannulated respectively to allow for NRP. Absence of 
cerebral perfusion is cross-checked with carotid Doppler. 
Once flow via the NRP circuit is established, a laparotomy 
is performed. After a period of up to 45 minutes, during 
which the heart is supported by NRP and is allowed to 
recondition, NRP is weaned. Functional assessment is then 
performed by means of trans-oesophageal echocardiography 
and thermodilution cardiac output studies by via a 
pulmonary artery flotation catheter.
For the instrumentation of the allograft on the 
TransMedics OCS, 1.5 L of donor blood are collected 
via the NRP circuit to prime the OCS in addition to the 
manufacturer provided priming solution. The heart is then 
arrested with 500 mL of cold crystalloid cardioplegia (St

Thomas’ no two solutions) to which is added supplementary 
erythropoietin and glyceryl trinitrate. The heart is then 
cannulated for instrumentation on the OCS.
DPP
In this method, a sternotomy and laparotomy are performed 
simultaneously. Following the opening of the pericardium, 
1.5 L of donor blood is collected in a heparinised blood 
collection bag via a cannula inserted into the right atrium to 
prime the OCS. Myocardial protection during procurement 
is achieved by the delivery of 500 mL of supplemented cold 
crystalloid cardioplegia as described for NRP. The heart is 
then instrumented on to the OCS in a similar fashion.
Perfusion on the TransMedics OCS
In addition to the manufacturer supplied prime solution, 
the collected donor blood is passed through a leucocyte 
filter to make up the priming volume of the OCS as per 
the manufacturer’s guidelines. Attention was paid to ensure 
that donor blood collection was performed prior to the 
delivery of cardioplegia. An additional variable infusion of 
TransMedics maintenance solution containing dextrose￾insulin and adenosine is added to the circuit along with a 
variable infusion of adrenaline. 
The aorta of the donor heart is cannulated to allow 
retrograde perfusion of the heart via the coronaries in the 
setting of a competent aortic valve. The heart is drained 
via cannulation of the pulmonary artery and a superior 
pulmonary vein vent is also placed to prevent any distension 
of the left ventricle. 
Aortic flow is maintained between 800–1,000 mL/min 
and the adenosine containing maintenance solution 
adjusted accordingly to maintain and aortic pressure of 
65–90 mmHg. The donor heart is paced epicardially to 
a rate between 70–90 beats per minute as required. If 
on reperfusion, the heart donor heart was noted to be in 
ventricular fibrillation, direct current cardioversion was 
performed to restore sinus rhythm. In addition to coronary 
flow and electrocardiographic monitoring, arterio-venous 
samples were taken to assess lactate metabolism as a 
surrogate for cardiac function.
Transplantation of the DCD heart
Irrespective of the method of DCD heart procurement 
utilised, the beating heart on the OCS was arrested with 
1 L of cold St Thomas’ cardioplegia and transplanted. 
Most transplant teams use a system of either antegrade or 
retrograde cardioplegia during implantation to further limit 
the burden of myocardial ischemia. 
Early results
In the modern era it was the paediatric transplant 
community that spear-headed the revival of DCD heart 
transplantation with the first reported case series of three 
paediatric DCD heart transplants. Since then this team 
have reported further success and a recent review in the 
International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation 
Registry revealed a total of 21 paediatric DCD heart 
transplants had been performed between 2005 and 2014 (21). 
Reported, was a similar overall survival between infant 
DCD and DBD recipients.
There are currently four centres worldwide that 
have established clinical DCD adult heart transplant 
programmes. Three of these centres are based in the UK—
Papworth Hospital, Harefield Hospital and Wythenshawe 
Hospital. St Vincent’s Hospital in Australia remains the 
only adult centre outside the UK performing DCD heart 
transplantation.
To date April 2017, Dhital et al. reported 12 
DCD heart transplants all performed using the DPP 
technique in Sydney, Australia. At the time of writing, 
all recipients remain alive although as reported through 
personal communication, 30% required ECMO support 
postoperatively. Donors are limited to 40 years old and the 
donation withdrawal ischemic time limited to 30 minutes. 
Papworth Hospital practises NRP, DPP and NRP/
Cold storage. The decision for which technique to use 
remains limited by the governing body for transplantation 
in the UK, NHS Blood and Transplant who have deemed 
it such that NRP is performed only in three donor 
referral hospitals. With 39 DCD heart transplants to date, 
Papworth Hospital has the largest DCD heart transplant 
programme in the world with very encouraging early 
results. In their programme, recipient’s survival to discharge 
following DCD heart transplantation is 93%, with only 
13% requiring ECMO support in the post-operative period. 
Recipients required a median stay of 5 days in intensive care 
with a median stay of 20 days in hospital. 
There is debate as to which technique of procurement is 
superior. The Sydney group, based on their experimental 
work (22), limit the time allowed from WLST to declaration 
of death to be eligible for DCD heart donation to 30 minutes.

The use of NRP allowing for a comprehensive functional 
assessment of cardiac function with data obtained 
from the pulmonary floatation catheter (PAFC) and 
trans-oesophageal echocardiography has allowed for 
this relatively short interval to be extended without 
compromising transplant outcomes (19). Additionally, the 
confidence provided by functional assessment has allowed 
for the inclusion of older donors, thus further expanding 
the potential donor pool. An early review describing the 
international experience of DCD heart transplantation to￾date, highlighted that there was no significant difference in 
mortality between the two techniques (21). However, from 
a health-economics perspective, it did highlight that the 
percentage conversion of hearts perfused on the OCS that 
proceeded to transplantation was higher in those who had 
been assessed on NRP, allowing for a significant cost-saving. 
More recently, a timely study published by Messer et al.
coinciding with the 50th anniversary of heart transplantation 
further confirms these findings (23). More importantly, 
they address the question of transplant outcomes of DCD 
hearts in comparison to the current gold-standard of DBD 
heart transplants. In a matched comparison, they found 
no significant difference in survival with a reported 92% 
90-day survival in the DCD group (n=26) with no 
differences in intensive care duration, length of hospital stay 
or the need for mechanical support. Interestingly, they did 
report better early cardiac function of the DCD allografts 
compared with the matched DBD cohort.
Ethical considerations
The use of NRP is not possible in certain countries due 
to the many varying legal definitions of death that exist 
globally. In the UK, current practice is based on the code 
of practice guidelines published by the Academy of Medical 
Royal Colleges (20). These guidelines allow for the use 
of NRP and for perfusion of the heart to be restarted 
within the donor provided that cerebral circulation is not 
restored. There are other legislative differences that exist 
in the process of declaration of death internationally. In the 
UK, a period of 5 minutes after mechanical asystole has 
to be allowed prior to the declaration of death, whereas in 
Australia this time period varies between 3 to 5 minutes 
and in the paediatric cohort in Colorado was reduced to 
75 seconds. Furthermore, the use of ante-mortem 
interventions such as ante-mortem heparin, while 
routinely practiced for DCD retrievals in some countries is 
unacceptable in the UK. 
Co-location of the donor and recipient, while an 
exceptionally rare occurrence, has been intentionally 
employed to facilitate paediatric DCD transplantation (17). 
However, this is not a strategy that is routinely acceptable 
in many other countries on ethical and logistic grounds 
despite the proposed clinical benefits. 
Future work
Although DCD heart transplantation has been shown 
to be a viable source of good quality donor hearts, there 
remains a lot of work that needs to be done to optimise 
this resource and allow patients to fully benefit from this 
procedure. Significant work has already been done in 
using post-conditioning agents on an ex-situ platform of 
perfusion to allow for better post-transplant outcome using 
pharmacological agents which has already translated into 
clinical practice (24). However, apart from using NRP, 
there remains significant doubt on the reliability of organ 
assessment on the OCS which is currently based on the 
use of lactate as a surrogate for organ quality together 
with flow parameters (25,26). Additionally, as with DBD 
transplantation, primary graft dysfunction (PGD) remains 
an issue and the platform of ex-situ perfusion allows for an 
opportunity to investigate potential bio-markers that may 
be used to predict PGD and indeed advise on organ quality. 
Although DCD heart transplantation has relied heavily 
on ex-situ organ perfusion where normothermia was 
the preferred strategy (27), there are a number of heart 
perfusion devices currently being developed which may 
offer an alternative strategy to preservation of the DCD 
heart (28). 
Conclusions
The results of the established DCD heart transplant 
programmes provide a strong case for DCD heart 
transplantation to be incorporated into existing heart 
transplant programmes worldwide. As experience grows, it 
will be important to follow the long-term outcomes of these 
pioneering programmes and promote wider adoption of this 
valuable resource for donor hearts for the ever-increasing 
number of patients with heart failure. However, we can say 
with increasing confidence that the current experience with 
DCD hearts has thus far proven to provide heart failure 
patients with at least equivalent outcomes to DBD heart 
transplantation. Additionally, the conservative estimates 
for the potential for DCD heart transplantation to increase

transplant activity have been exceeded (28,29). Despite it 
being 50 years since the first DCD heart transplant, the 
use of DCD hearts with distant procurement and isolated 
heart perfusion is in its infancy, and further research is 
required into defining the limits of this technique as well 
as mechanisms for optimising DCD hearts. With further 
developments in attenuating ischemic insults using pre- and 
post-conditioning strategies we may be able to extend the 
time limits and even allow for organ repair. The platform 
for isolated heart perfusion provides us with a unique 
opportunity to investigate heart assessment, donor-recipient 
matching and organ preservation. This future for heart 
transplantation and organ donation may not only be limited 
geographical boundaries but a global service to our patients.
