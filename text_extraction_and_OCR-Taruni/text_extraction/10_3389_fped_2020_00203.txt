Background: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is the standard of care for gallbladder
(GB) pathologies. We evaluated clinical, ultrasonographic (US) data as well as
histopathological findings in children affected with symptomatic cholecystic disease
(SCD) who underwent LC, with the aim of defining surgical timing.
Methods: We reviewed our cases who underwent elective LC (ELC) or urgent LC (ULC).
Clinical, US, surgical and histological features were used to create different risk scores.
Results: We considered 26 children (17 ELC/9 ULC). US signs were not different
in the two groups (p > 0.05). Operating times were longer in ELC than in ULC (p
= 0.01). Histopathological evaluation revealed fibrosis and atrophy in both ELC and
ULC. The clinical risk score was higher in ELC compared to ULC (p < 0.001). An
increased operative risk score was noted in patients with systemic inflammatory signs
(OR1.98), lithotherapy (OR1.4.3) and wall thickening ≥3 mm (OR2.6). An increased
histopathological risk score was detected in children with symptom duration >7 days
(OR3.61), concomitant hematological disease (OR1.23) and lithotherapy (OR3.61).
Conclusion: Criteria adopted in adults cannot be adopted to detect the severity of GB
damage in children. A dedicated clinical and US score is mandatory to define the most
appropriate surgical timing.

INTRODUCTION
The spectrum of gallbladder (GB) disorders in the pediatric population has changed over the
past three decades (1). While they were previously largely attributable to hemolytic diseases,
the prevalence of pediatric cholelithiasis has proportionally increased with the childhood obesity
epidemic (2, 3).
Additionally, the improved survival of critically ill newborns who have received long-term
parenteral nutrition or have underlying abnormalities resulting in short-bowel syndrome is

Pelizzo et al. Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy in Children
considered a new factor related to the increased incidence
of cholelithiasis in children (1, 4, 5). In turn, increases in
the incidence of cholecystectomies have been described in
pediatrics (1–3).
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) for calculous cholecystitis
is the current standard of care for GB pathologies in
children (6). To date no evidence regarding a correlation
between clinical severity and histopathological findings have
been identified in the pediatric age. While preoperative
scoring systems have been created for adults, (7, 8). specific
criteria supporting surgical timing have not been approved
in children.
In this study, we retrospectively reviewed the clinical and
sonographic data and histopathological findings in patients
affected with symptomatic cholecystic disease (SCD), who
underwent LC.
Data were analyzed to support the best indications for surgical
timing in the pediatric age.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients
Data were retrospectively analyzed from December 2016
to March 2019 in patients who were admitted to our
Surgical Department with a diagnosis of abdominal pain and
suspicion of symptomatic cholecystic disease and subsequently
underwent LC.
Clinical characteristics, sonographic features, surgical
procedures, outcomes, and histopathologic evaluation were
recorded in all patients. According to their clinical presentation,
ultrasound parameters and inflammatory status, the enrolled
patients were divided into two groups:
(1) Group 1, Elective Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy (ELC).
This group included children presenting with painful abdominal
symptoms for more than seven days and within 6 months of the
earliest symptom referred by the patient: simple cholelithiasis,
local Murphy’s sign, right upper quadrant mass/pain/tenderness
at first examination, without signs of inflammation and
previous lithotherapy.
Conservative management included 3 months medical
treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid (dose 10–20 mg/kg/day),
clinical examination and US evaluation approximately once
a month.
(2) Group 2, Urgent Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy group
(ULC). This group included children who presented with right
upper quadrant mass/pain/tenderness, local Murphy’s sign and
systemic signs of fever, elevated C-reactive protein, elevated
white blood cell count, complicated cholelithiasis (cholecystitis
or choledocholithiasis). Absence of symptom resolution and
biochemical changes in inflammation (according to the 2018
Tokyo Guidelines) were considered indications for ULC within
the first 7 days of symptom onset (9).
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board
of our center and was conducted in accordance with the 1975
Helsinki Declaration. The written consent for participation in the
study is obtained.
Methods
Data Collection
Data collection included the following variables: (1) clinical and
biochemical data, (2) ultrasound features, (3) operative details,
and (4) histopathological results.
Clinical and Biochemical Data
Clinical data included: age, gender, clinical features, previous
abdominal surgeries, duration of symptoms, laboratory findings
(including liver panel). Clinical features were used to create
a clinical risk score, including: symptom duration >7 days,
local Murphy’s sign, systemic inflammatory signs, concomitant
hematological disease, previous treatment with lithotherapy. For
each parameter, a dichotomous variable was created (0 = absence
and 1 = presence of these parameters, respectively).
Ultrasound Features
For all patients a sonographic investigation was performed with
the ATL 5,000 ultrasound instrument using a 12–5 MHz linear
array transducer in longitudinal and transverse planes, in the
supine position.
The US study score included the presence of:
- specific signs including gallstones (single or multiple)
and sonographic Murhpy sign (maximal tenderness from
ultrasound probe pressure over the GB)
- aspecific signs including wall thickening ≥ 3 mm, gallstone
dimensions >3 mm, GB distension, presence of pericholecystic
fluid (10, 11).
A US score was defined using the parameters detailed in Table 1,
which scaled the severity of the condition. For each parameter, a
dichotomous variable was created (0 = absence and 1 = presence
of these parameters, respectively).
Surgical Procedure and Data Recorded
The standard four-port surgical approach was utilized with:
trans-umbilical open access, three trocars (2 operative and 1
accessory), cystic artery and ligation of the duct with non￾absorbable polymer clips (knots or Hem-o-lok clip) and GB
removal through the umbilical access.
All LC were performed by surgeons with more than 5
years’ experience.
Operative details, including approach, duration and
intraoperative events, post-operative complications,
post-operative recovery were recorded.
As reported in Table 2, an operative grading system/score was
adopted (12) to define surgical findings, which may also be useful
in the pediatric laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Also here for each
parameter, a dichotomous variable was constructed (0 = absence
and 1 = presence of these parameters, respectively).
Histological Analysis
The excised specimens, after fixation, were sectioned on multiple
levels, processed and paraffin embedded. The blocks were cut
into 2µm axial sections. After hematoxylin/eosin staining,
histological analysis was performed with an OlympusR Bx61

were included in the ELC group and nine subjects (34.6%) in the
ULC group. The features of the patients are reported in Table 4.
No significant differences between gender (p = 0.3) and age (p
= 0.1) were noted between the groups.
Splenomegaly was found in 3/17 (17.6%) ELC and 4/9 (44.4%)
ULC (p = 0.1) and hepatomegaly in 2/9 (22.2%) ULC (p = 0.1).
Biochemical parameters were similar in both groups, Table 4.
No significant differences regarding previous abdominal
surgeries were recorded between the groups (p = 0.9).
Ultrasound Features
As reported in Table 4, the presence of specific US signs was
similar in the two groups (gallstones p = 0.68, sonographic
Murphy sign p = 0.6). Aspecific features (gallstone dimensions
>3 mm, p = 0.8; gallbladder distension p = 0.9; wall thickening
≥ 3 mm, p = 0.2) were not different in ELC compared to
ULC. No patients exhibited the presence of organ adhesions,
pericholecystic fluid or peritoneal fluid.
In 2 children, one in the ECL group and one in the ULC group,
anatomical abnormalities were detected (p = 0.6).
Surgery
The mean operative time was significantly longer in ELC than in
ULC (173.6–69.9 min vs. 112.7–53.7 min, p = 0.01).
Adhesiolysis was required in 10/17 (58.82%) ELC and in 6
(66.67%) ULC, p = 0.69. Hepatic tissue hemostasis was more
frequently required in ULC than in ELC (p = 0.04). The
identification of frailty (p = 0.1) and macroscopic signs of wall
inflammation (p = 0.2), were similar in both groups.
Hilar lymphnode involvement was recorded in 7/17 ELC and
4/9 ULC (p = 0.87).
In seven cases (4 ECL and 3 ULC, p = 0.59), intraoperative
cholangiography was necessary to clean the biliary tree.
Intraoperative spillage was recorded in two cases in the ULC
group (p = 0.04). Conversion to laparotomy and drainage
positioning were not necessary in any subject.
In every patient, the GB was removed through the umbilical
port without complications. No post-operative complications
occurred in either group. No major morbidities, including
recurrent pancreatitis, were observed nor any deaths in
either group.
A longer post-operative stay was recorded in ULC compared
to ELC (10.1 ± 5.0 and 5.1 ± 1.4 days p = 0.02).
Histopathology
The histological parameters and their severity grading are
reported in Table 5. Severe damage of the GB was detected
in both groups. Regarding the two groups, there were no
significant differences at the level of ulcers and/or ulcerations
(p = 0.70), phlogosis (p = 0.06), inflammatory cell infiltration
(p = 0.62), fibrosis (p = 0.37), adenomyosis (0.33), reactive
epithelial hyperplasia (0.06), epithelial atrophy (p = 0.59);
parietal atrophy (p = 0.22); intramural microlitiasis (p = 0.46);
intestinal metaplasia (p = 0.28). In 2/3 patients with metaplasia,
a multiseptate GB was detected.
Risk Score
The clinical risk score was higher in ELC compared to ULC (p
< 0.001). No significant differences were noted in US, operative
and histopathological risk scores (p = 0.49, p = 0.36, p =
0.17, respectively).
An increased operative risk score was noted in patients with
systemic inflammatory signs (OR 1.98, p = 0.35), previous
treatment with lithotherapy (OR 14.3, p = 0.003) and US
detection of wall thickening ≥ 3 mm (OR 2.6, p = 0.17).
An increased histopathological risk score was detected in
children with a symptom duration >7 days (OR 3.61, p = 0.12),
concomitant hematological disease (OR 1.23, p = 0.77) and prior
treatment with lithotherapy (OR 3.61, p = 0.12).
DISCUSSION
Cholelithiasis is a relatively uncommon pediatric disease, with
a prevalence between 0.13 and 0.22% that is currently on
the rise (13). Around 80% of patients with gallstones remain
asymptomatic (14, 15). Gallstones can block the cystic duct
causing GB distension and biliary colic. Prolonged obstruction
results in inflammation, infection, and even ischemia, resulting in

acute inflammation of GB; repeated episodes can result in chronic
cholecystitis, in which a thickened GB wall, GB mucosal atrophy
and scarring were detected (16).
There is no consensus on the management of children with
cholelithiasis and the risks of developing complications as a
consequence of delaying surgery are well-known (17–19). More
than 70% of cases admitted in emergency became symptomatic
when surgery is delayed after a mean time of 38 months.
Additionally, the overall incidence of cholecystitis in childhood
is divided to include the calculous form and the acalculous form.
The latter is reported to be increasing in the pediatric population
(20, 21).
At the early stage, the diagnosis of acute GB diseases is
also difficult because symptoms are non-specific and a clinical
manifestation of the presence of cholecystitis, such as Murphy’s
sign, may be difficult to detect in children. Thus, abdominal
ultrasonography (US) is considered the most accurate diagnostic
technique, it is also cost-effective, free of radiation hazards and
highly specific to the biliary system (22, 23). On the other hand,
there is a well-known, significant intra- and inter-observer risk
in US evaluation. Additionally, as reported by Tsai, ultrasound
findings in pediatric cholecystitis have lower sensitivities and
positive predictive values than those reported in adults (24, 25).
LC has gradually become the technique of choice for
symptomatic gallstones also in the pediatric age (6). Compared
with open cholecystectomy, this procedure has several
advantages including less post-operative pain, a short recovery
period, faster return to unrestricted activities and better
cosmetic results. Indications for surgery include symptomatic
cholelithiasis unresponsive to medical treatment, no longer
recommended in the pediatric population (26). Several
predisposing factors, including hemolytic disorders and obesity,
may create problems of the GB that require surgery (26).
The severity of the GB pathological condition is a key factor
in determining the feasibility of the laparoscopic approach
and defining the surgical timing (26). Patients with difficult
cholecystectomies are at significantly higher risk of biliary duct
injury conversion rate, general complications and longer surgical
times. Intense inflammation and firm adhesions of the GB with
the common bile duct, duodenum or even the colon due to
complicated cholecystitis make dissection and identification of
the anatomy very difficult (27, 28). Bleeding during dissection
further hinders the safe identification of anatomy. According to
the Safe Cholecystectomy Program of the Society of American
Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons, achieving the Critical
View of Safety is defined by three criteria: the hepato-cystic
triangle is cleared of fat and fibrous tissue; the lower one third
of the GB is separated from the liver to expose the cystic
plate and no more than two structures should be seen entering
the GB (28).
Our results showed that both ELC and ULC are safe and
feasible in children. The clinical parameters and ultrasonographic
criteria currently used in adults (7, 8) to define the timing of LC
do not allow the severity prediction of the GB histopathological
condition and consequently the surgical outcome in children.
We observed severe damage of the GB in both groups, including
chronic signs of inflammation and pre-cancerous conditions,
such as metaplasia. These features suggest that children may have
milder episodes of self-limited GB inflammation compared with
adults, which may lead to delayed treatment (24).
Traditionally, GBs removed for presumed benign disease
are sent for histopathological examination, but this practice
has been the subject of controversy. Considering the very
low incidence of pre-malignant and malignant lesions of the
gallbladder, some authors recommend selective histopathological
examination of cholecystectomy specimens with abnormal
macroscopic findings (29–32).
We suggest routine histopathological examination for all
cholecystectomy specimens removed for benign GB diseases in

the pediatric age, in order to detect metaplasia. As reported by
the Royal College of Pathologists (33) oncological diagnosis can
be missed, particularly in patients with a multiseptate GB. This
condition is considered an indication for surgery and a risk factor
for developing GB degeneration.
While a number of preoperative scoring systems are utilized in
adults, (7, 8) in pediatric patients there is no useful classification
to predict prognosis and outcome. The results of the present
study, revealed that the identification of dedicated preoperative
clinical-ultrasound scores for the pediatric age that are predictive
of disease severity should allow optimization of surgical timing.
According to our risk score, long duration of symptoms,
systemic inflammatory signs, previous lithotherapy and wall
thickening ≥3 mm should be considered as crucial parameters
to detect severe forms that necessitate immediate surgery, as
in adults. On the contrary, some parameters, such as age, sex,
history of abdominal surgery, which are usually used in adult
scoring systems are not useful in pediatrics. Finally ultrasound
parameters such as hydropic gallbladder (diameter > 4.5 cm) and
shrunken gallbladder (8) are not adequate in pediatrics due to
the differences in the measurements for a normal GB, which
are related to height, weight, and body surface area, during the
development age (34).
We recognize that there are some limitations in this study
starting from the limited sample size. Therefore, a larger cohort
of patients is mandatory to confirm these results. Additionally,
the lack of clinical and auxological data (i.e., BMI, neonatal
history) may have limited the interpretation of symptoms and
US features and these could represent possible factors influencing
intraoperative difficulty.
In conclusion, the criteria defining the timing of surgery are
not available, nor is there consensus on criteria grading the
severity of GB damage in pediatric population. Clinical and
US scores are mandatory to define appropriate surgical timing
in children.
