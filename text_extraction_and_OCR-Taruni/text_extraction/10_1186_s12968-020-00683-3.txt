Abstract
Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) enables assessment and quantification of morphological and functional 
parameters of the heart, including chamber size and function, diameters of the aorta and pulmonary arteries, flow 
and myocardial relaxation times. Knowledge of reference ranges (“normal values”) for quantitative CMR is crucial to 
interpretation of results and to distinguish normal from disease. Compared to the previous version of this review pub‑
lished in 2015, we present updated and expanded reference values for morphological and functional CMR parameters 
of the cardiovascular system based on the peer-reviewed literature and current CMR techniques. Further, databases 
and references for deep learning methods are included.

Background
Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) provides 
a wealth of information to help distinguish health from 
disease. In addition to non-invasively  defining chamber 
sizes and global function, CMR can also assess regional 
cardiac  function as well as tissue composition (myo￾cardial T1, T2 and T2* relaxation time). Advantages of 
quantitative evaluation of CMR images are objective dif￾ferentiation between pathology and normal conditions, 
grading of disease severity, monitoring changes during 
therapy and evaluating prognosis [1].
Knowledge of the range of normal structure and func￾tion is required to interpret abnormal cardiac  condi￾tions. Thus, the aim of this review is to provide reference 
intervals (“normal values”) for morphological and func￾tional CMR parameters of the cardiovascular system 
based on a systematic review of the literature using cur￾rent CMR techniques and sequences.
Since the initial publication of the “normal value 
review” in 2015 [1], new research related to CMR refer￾ence values have been published and are now integrated 
in this update. Previous topics were expanded with new 
sections including morphological and functional param￾eters in athletes, myocardial T2 mapping, myocardial 
perfusion, left-ventricular (LV) trabeculation and nor￾mal dimensions of the pulmonary arteries in adults and 
children. Further, feature tracking is increasingly used to 
assess myocardial strain and reference intervals are now 
available for that technology. Deep learning methods are 
rapidly being incorporated into clinical software analysis 
packages [2, 3]. These new analytic methods are expected 
to accelerate quantification of myocardial function from 
CMR images. To date, reference ranges based on cohorts 
of healthy subjects using deep learning methods have not

been presented. However due to the potential impor￾tance of this topic, we present algorithms and major ref￾erences related to CMR on these methods.
Methods
A literature search was performed in PubMed to identify 
publications of CMR reference intervals for each sec￾tion. When feasible (discussed further below), we sought 
to provide weighted means calculated based on these 
published normal values in healthy individuals. General 
criteria used for inclusion of data in this review are as 
follows:
a) Sample size of at least 40 subjects. 40 subjects is 
accepted as the smallest sample size that allows 
calculation of reference ranges using a parametric 
method for data with a Gaussian distribution [4]. In 
some circumstances, separate reference ranges need 
to be provided by gender. In that case, the sample 
size of included studies were at least a minimum of 
40 subjects per gender. Exceptions to sample size of 
40 subjects per group were made for clinically rele￾vant parameters where no publication was available 
with sufficient sample size for certain parameters. 
However, reference ranges based on a smaller sample 
size are of limited validity and should be applied with 
caution.
b) Only values of “healthy” reference cohorts were 
included. In particular, reference cohorts that 
included subjects with a disease or condition known 
to affect the measured parameter (e.g. hypertension 
and diabetes) were excluded. For publications that 
described population statistics (e.g., the MESA study, 
UK Biobank), we used data only from subgroups of 
individuals without risk factors or conditions known 
to affect the CMR parameter. In cases where the 
original manuscript did not provide sufficient infor￾mation to allow upper and lower limits to be calcu￾lated, authors were contacted for clarification.
c) If two or more publications were determined to refer 
to the same healthy reference cohort, the values of 
the cohort were included only once.
Manuscripts were then excluded from consideration as 
follows: (a) obsolescent CMR technique, (b) missing data 
that were not provided by the authors of the original pub￾lication on request and/ or (c) insufficient or inconsistent 
description of methods and/or (d) methods of analysis 
that were not consistent with current Society for Cardio￾vascular Magnetic Resonance (SCMR) guidelines [5] as 
of the time of this review.
Technical factors such as sequence parameters are 
relevant for CMR, and these factors are provided in 
relationship to the reference values. In addition, factors 
related to post processing will affect the CMR analysis 
and these factors are also described. Finally, when avail￾able,  the relationship of demographic factors (e.g. age, 
gender, and ethnicity) to reference values are described in 
each section.
Statistical methods
Statistical analyses were performed with R for statistical 
computing (version 3.5, R Core Team, Vienna, Austria). 
Results from multiple studies reporting normal values 
for the same CMR parameters were combined using a 
random effects meta-analysis model as implemented by 
the metamean function in the meta library in R. This 
produced a weighted, pooled estimate of the population 
mean of the CMR parameters in the combined studies. 
Upper and lower limits of normal values were calculated 
as±2SDp, where SDp is the pooled standard deviation 
calculated from the standard deviations reported in each 
study. Mean values and limits of normal values were 
“rounded up” to avoid excess digits beyond the measure￾ment capability of CMR.
Left ventricular dimensions and functions 
in the adult
CMR acquisition parameters
The primary method used to assess the LV is bal￾anced  steady-state free precession (bSSFP) technique 
at 1.5 or 3  T CMR (Table  1). bSSFP technique yields 
improved blood-myocardial contrast compared to its 
predecessor, fast gradient echo (FGRE) sequence.
CMR analysis methods
Papillary muscle mass has been shown to significantly affect 
LV volumes and mass [6–8]. No uniformly accepted con￾vention has been used for analyzing trabeculation and papil￾lary muscle mass. Post-processing recommendations by the 
SCMR [9] stipulate that papillary muscles should either be 
consistently included in the LV volume or in the LV mass, 
but not in both. Tables of normal values should specify the 
status of the papillary muscles in the CMR analysis.
The majority of published articles used semi-automatic 
software for analysis of LV function and structure [10–16]. 
Short-axis images are most commonly analyzed on a per￾slice basis, deriving LV mass and volume by applying the 
Simpson’s method (“stack of disks”) [17]. An example of LV 
contouring is shown in Fig.  1. Automated CMR analysis 
facilitated by machine learning is rapidly making inroads in 
LV volume and mass quantification [3]. The primary focus 
of early manuscripts has been on agreement between man￾ual and automatic contouring [2]. However, to date, CMR 
variables for healthy cohorts have not been reported using 
machine learning methods.

Studies included in this review
Multiple studies have presented cohorts of normal indi￾viduals for determining normal LV  dimensions . For 
the purpose of this review, only cohorts of 40 or more 
normal subjects stratified by gender using bSSFP CMR 
technique at 1.5 or 3  T have been included. In addi￾tion, a full description of the subject cohort (including 
the analysis methods used), age and gender of subjects 
was required to be included for this review. Two stud￾ies [18, 19] included papillary muscles in LV volume 
except if directly attached to the LV wall, in which case 
they were included in LV mass (LVM) instead. Since this 
approach was inconsistent with post-processing rec￾ommended by SCMR [9] and other manuscripts on the 
topic, both studies were excluded from the current anal￾ysis. Data at 1.5 and 3 T is now available for normal sub￾jects using bSSFP short axis imaging. Since it has been 
shown that parameters of LV volumes and function do 
not vary by field strength, calculation of the weighted 
means of these parameters include studies performed at 
1.5 T and 3 T [20]. Information on ethnicity in relation￾ship to LV parameters is not available for the majority 
of papers reporting the bSSFP technique and is there￾fore not reported in this review. However, small differ￾ences in LV parameters by ethnicity have been reported 
in the Multi-ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) 
study; for further information on the magnitude of such

short axis view (b, d). The longitudinal diameter of the LV was measured on the 4 chamber view as the distance between the mitral valve plane and 
the LV apex (a, c). On the 4 chamber view the transverse diameter was defined as the distance between the septum and the lateral wall at the basal 
level [18]. On the short axis view the transverse diameter was obtained at the level of the basal papillary muscles (b, d) [15]

differences, the reader is referred to the work by Natori 
S et al. [21].
Normal adult values for LV dimensions and func￾tions according to those studies that consistently 
included papillary muscles in the LVM are presented in 
Tables 2, 3, 4, whereas those that consistently included 
papillary muscles in the LV volume are presented in 
Table  5. For parameters with sufficient sample size, 
values are also presented per age decile (Tables 3, 4).
Additional left ventricular function parameters
In addition to left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), 
Maceira et  al. have provided additional functional 
parameters that may be useful in some settings [10]. 
These are summarized in Table  6. For diastolic func￾tion, the derivative of the time/volume filling curve 
expresses the peak filling rate (PFR). Both early (E) 
and active (A) transmitral filling rates are provided. In 
addition, longitudinal atrioventricular plane descent 
(AVPD) and sphericity index (volume observed/volume 
of sphere using long axis as diameter) at end diastole 
and end systole are given. These latter parameters are 
not routinely used for clinical diagnosis. A number of 
publications have also reported LV end-diastolic and 
end-systolic diameters by CMR; these parameters are 
summarized in Table 7.
Right ventricular dimensions and functions 
in the adult
CMR acquisition parameters
For measurement of right ventricular (RV) volumes, a 
stack of cine bSSFP images is acquired either in the short 
axis plane or transaxial plane [9].
CMR analysis methods
Similar to the LV, analysis of the RV is usually performed 
on a per slice basis by manual contouring of the endo￾cardial and epicardial borders. Volumes are calculated 
based on the Simpson’s method [17]. The RV volumes 
and mass are significantly affected by inclusion or exclu￾sion of trabeculations and papillary muscles [27, 28]. 
For manual contouring, inclusion of trabeculations and 
papillary muscles as part of the RV volume will achieve 
higher reproducibility [9, 27, 28]. However, semiauto￾matic software is increasingly used for volumetric analy￾sis, enabling automatic delineation of papillary muscles 
[29]. Therefore, normal values for both methods are pro￾vided. An example for RV contouring is shown in Fig. 1.

Detailed recommendations for RV acquisitions and post 
processing have been published [9].
Demographic parameters
RV mass and volumes are dependent on body surface 
area (BSA) [14, 29]. Absolute and RV volumes indexed by 
BSA are significantly larger in males compared to females 
[11, 14, 16, 18, 22, 29]. Further, RV volumes decrease with 
greater age [11, 14, 16, 18, 22, 29].
Studies included in this review
Criteria regarding study inclusion are identical com￾pared to the  LV. Nine studies based on bSSFP imaging 
were included (Table 8). In one study, papillary muscles 
were included as part of the RV mass and excluded from 
the RV volume [29] with results presented for men and 
women in Table  9. In the remaining eight studies, the 
papillary muscles were included as part of the RV cavity 
volume rather than included in the RV mass [11, 14–16, 
18, 22–24] with pooled weighted mean values presented 
for men and women (Table 10). For a subset of three of 
these studies [18, 23, 24], for parameters with a sufficient 
sample size pooled weighted mean values are presented 
based on age deciles between 20 and 59 years of age for 
both men (Table 11) and women (Table 12).
Additional RV function parameters
Similar to the LV, Maceira et al. have provided additional 
functional parameters, including early and active peak 
filling rate and the longitudinal AVPD, that may have rel￾evance to specific applications and can be found in the 
original publication [29].
Left atrial dimensions and functions in the adult
CMR acquisition parameters
There is limited consensus in the literature about how 
to measure left atrial  (LA) volume. The most common 
methods to measure LA volume are the modified Simp￾son’s method (analogous to that used to measure LV and 
RV volumes) and the biplane area-length method [30]. 
Dedicated 3-dimensional modeling software has also 
been employed [31].
In the Simpson’s method, a stack of cine bSSFP images 
either in the SAx, the horizontal long axis or transverse 
view, is required. For 3-dimensional modeling a stack of 
SAx images has been used [31]. Evaluation by the biplane 
area-length method is based on a 2 and 4 chamber view 
[11, 16, 32–34].
LA longitudinal and transverse diameters and area 
have been measured on 2, 3, and 4 chamber cine bSSFP 
images [31, 33, 35] (Fig. 3).

CMR analysis methods
In many studies the LA appendage has been included as 
part of the LA volume and pulmonary veins are excluded 
[14, 31], but the practice of excluding both structures 
from the  LA volume is increasingly gaining acceptance 
[11, 16, 32, 34].
The maximal LA volume is achieved during ventricu￾lar systole. In a cine acquisition, the maximum volume 
image can be defined as last image immediately before 
opening of the mitral valve. Accordingly the minimal LA 
volume image can be defined as the first image after clo￾sure of the mitral valve [36].

Demographic parameters
Body surface area (BSA) has been shown to have a 
significant independent influence on LA volume and 
most diameters [31]. Per Sievers et  al. [35], age was 
not an independent predictor of LA maximal volume 
or diameter in normal individuals. Men have a larger 
maximal LA volume compared to women [31, 35].

on bSSFP imaging with sufficient sample size (n>40) 
and these are reported in Table 13. Four of these publi￾cations used the biplane area-length method, one used 
the Simpson’s method, one used both, one used a 3D 
modeling technique and the remainder measured diam￾eters or areas. Publications reporting population-based 
cohort data rather than true normal data have been 
excluded from the current analysis as have publications 
that incompletely describe the measurement method 
used [22] or the manner in which pulmonary veins/LA 
appendage were handled. Normal values for  LA volumes 
and function are presented in Table 14, and normal val￾ues for LA diameters in Table 15.
Right atrial dimensions and functions in the adult
CMR acquisition parameters
There is no consensus in the literature regarding acquisi￾tion and measurement method for the right atrium (RA). 
Published methods for RA volume include the modified 
Simpson’s method, the biplane area-length method and 
3D-modeling [23, 24, 37]. For Simpson’s method and 
3D modeling, a stack of cine bSSFP images in the SAx 
view are analyzed. For the biplane area-length method, 
a 4-chamber view and a RV 2-chamber view are utilized 
[33] (Fig. 4).
CMR analysis methods
The inferior and superior vena cava are excluded from 
the RA volume but there is variability in the inclusion 
[14, 37] or exclusion [33] of the RA appendage.
The maximal RA volume is achieved during ventricular 
systole and can be defined as the last cine image before 
opening of the tricuspid valve. The minimal RA volume 
can be defined as the first cine image after closure of the 
tricuspid valve.
Demographic parameters
Maceira et  al. demonstrated the relationship of most 
RA parameters to BSA, but there was no influence of 
age on atrial parameters and no influence of gender on 
atrial volumes [37]. Other studies have demonstrated an 
influence of gender [14, 33] and age [11, 33] on some RA 
parameters. In the study by LeVen et al. gender was inde￾pendently associated with RA end-diastolic volume and 
RA end-systolic volume with men having greater values 
compared to women [14]. In the study by Li et al. the lon￾gitudinal RA diameter measured in the 2 chamber and 4 
chamber view indexed to BSA and the indexed transverse 
diameter measured on the 4 chamber view were greater 
in women than in men [33]. Further, the RA volume 
indexed to BSA was larger in males than in females [33]. 
Le et  al. found a week correlation between the RA area 
indexed to BSA with age [11].
Studies included in this review
There are five publications with reference values for the 
RA based on bSSFP imaging with sufficient sample size 
to be included [11, 14, 18, 33, 37] (Table  16). Pooled 
weighted mean values for RA volumes and function 
are provided in Table  17 using the biplane area-length 
method (RA appendage excluded) or Simpson’s method 
(either RA appendage included or excluded) for men and 
women. Pooled weighted mean values for RA areas and 
diameters are provided in Table 18 for men and women.

Left and right ventricular dimensions and function 
in children
The presentation of normal values in children is different 
than in the adult population due to continuous changes in 
body weight and height as a function of age. Normal data 
in children are frequently presented in percentiles and/or 
z-scores (standard deviation score). Z-scores are given as
z - value = (measurement−mean of the population)/(standard deviation of the mean of the population).
Even though previous studies [39–41] have reported 
a linear correlation between ventricular volumes and 
BSA in children, there is increasing evidence that the 
assumption of a simple linear or exponential rela￾tionship between somatic growth and age may not be 
correct. Moreover the relationship between cardiac 
growth and body growth is still not clearly understood 
and may vary along age in the developing child [42, 
43].
The construction of reference curves using the 
Lamda-Mu-Sigma (LMS) method is a different way of 
creating normalized growth percentile curves. In this 
approach after a power transformation skewness of

the data can be transformed into normality and trends 
are summarized in a smooth curve (L); trends in the 
mean (M) and coefficient of variation (S) are similarly 
smoothed. LMS curves are easy to use in daily practice 
and can account for nonlinear relationships between 
body and cardiac size and age.
The LMS method is highly efficient to obtain normal￾ity in small datasets, for instance in the group of young 
children. Thus, even extreme values (small children) can 
be so converted into exact standard deviation scores [44].
Demographic parameters
The largest cohort of normal data on ventricular size and 
function in paediatric patients using the bSSFP sequence 
refers to a population of 141 healthy children collected 
in three European reference centers. All subjects were 
Caucasian and included 68 boys and 73 girls. Age dis￾tribution, body size and heart rate were equal between 
genders. Only 12/141 children were younger than 6 years 
[45].
Boys had larger ventricles than girls [45]. LVEF was 
found to be slightly higher in boys (67% vs 65%; p 0.01), 
but not for the RV [45]. Gender differences are more 
marked in older children, indicating that gender is more 
important after puberty and in adulthood.
Studies included in this review
Table  19 shows studies meeting inclusion criteria. The 
reference values for the LV and RV presented in the study 
by van der Ven [45] have been pooled from three previ￾ous studies [39–41], that have been reported separately 
in the previous version of our review [1]. Data are pre￾sented in percentile curves referred to age by using the 
LMS Method (Figs. 5, 6).
CMR analysis methods
For calculation of reference values from reference 
[45], the original bSSFP images (short axis) have been 
re-analysed by manual segmentation by one operator, 
after consensus on the segmentation rules was estab￾lished within the group. These followed the standards 
proposed by SCMR [46], except for the trabeculations 
of the RV, required for calculating the RV mass. In the 
RV major trabeculae were included in the myocardium

wall in more than 2 adjacent slices. Trabecular islands 
not connected to the wall were included in the blood 
pool [45].
Left and right atrial dimensions and function

CMR acquisition parameters
 LA  and RA dimensions and function were evaluated 
using bSSFP technique in a single publication [47], 
(Table  19). Measurements were obtained on a stack 
of transverse cine bSSFP images with a slice thickness 
between 5 and 6 mm without interslice gap [47].
CMR analysis methods
In [47], the pulmonary veins, the superior and inferior 
vena cava and the coronary sinus were excluded from the 
LA and RA volume, respectively, while the atrial append￾ages were included in the volume of the respective

atrium) on the 2-chamber (top row) and 4-chamber (bottom row) views. In B), longitudinal diameter (L) is obtained from the posterior wall of the RA 
to the center of the tricuspid plane, and transverse diameter (T) is obtained perpendicular to the longitudinal diameter, at the mid level of the RA. C

atrium. The maximal atrial volume was measured at ven￾tricular end-systole and the minimal atrial volume at ven￾tricular end-diastole.
Demographic parameters
LA  and RA volumes show an increase with age with a 
plateau after the age of 14 for girls only. Absolute and 
indexed volumes have been shown to be significantly 
greater for boys compared to girls (except for the indexed 
maximal volumes for both atria) [47].
Studies included in this review
Sarikouch et al. evaluated atrial parameters of 115 healthy 
children (Table  19) [47] using bSSFP imaging. Data is 
presented as L, M, S values to enable calculation of the 
standard deviation score and in percentiles (Tables  20, 
21).
Cardiac chamber size in the athlete
CMR analysis methods
Methodologic considerations for CMR analysis are the 
same as for the non-athletes heart as described in the 
sections above. In both studies included in this review, 
papillary muscles and trabeculations were included in the 
ventricular volumes and excluded from LV and RV mass.
Demographic parameters
Following the Mitchell classification, sports can be char￾acterized as being high or low in dynamic (endurance, 
isotonic) versus static (strength/resistance, isometric) 
training and performance components [48]. Athletic 
competition can therefore be primarily (a) endurance 
(e.g. long distance running, swimming), (b) combined 
(e.g. rowers, cyclists) or (c) strength (e.g. body building 
and weight training). There are insufficient numbers of 
study subjects available in the literature to establish nor￾mative values for the strength category of athletes [49].
Cardiac chamber sizes may vary depending on the 
extent of exercise and training. One approach to classi￾fication is 9–18 h of training per week (regular athletes) 
vs>18  h training per week (elite athletes) [50]. Adap￾tive changes to exercise are greater with higher exercise/
training level [49].
Luijkx found a balanced increase of LV and RV cham￾ber  volume in relationship in the athlete heart [51]; a 
large meta-analysis of the literature had a similar con￾clusion [49]. RV and LV systolic function is commonly 
characterized by ejection fraction, but this parameter is 
known to show the most variation between observers. 
Nevertheless, RVEF and LVEF are>50% in reports of the 
athlete’s heart by CMR [48].
The RV chamber  volumes are greater in the athletes 
heart than in normal individuals [51]. The athlete’s 
RV volumes may exceed CMR criteria for abnormal￾ity in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy 
(ARVC). However, RVEF is in the normal range of non￾athletes even in the athlete heart (i.e.>50%) whereas 
RVEF is abnormally low (≤45%) in ARVC.
Studies included in this review
After elimination of redundant publications using the 
same study population and publications with > 40 ath￾letes, there is one publication with data on the ath￾lete’s heart by Prakken et al. (Table 22) [50]. This study 
was performed at 1.5  T and has sufficient descrip￾tion of CMR analysis technique to enable comparison 
(Tables  23, 24). Papillary muscles and trabeculation 
were included in ventricular volumes and excluded from 
myocardial mass. The study by Prakken et al. [50] speci￾fied levels of training (regular athletes 9–18  h/week; 
elite athletes > 18  h per week), both endurance and 
combined types of athletic participation were included. 
In contrast, Tahir et al. [52] identified athletes as those 
competing in triathlons (classified as ‘combined’ sport 
activity and training for more than 10 h per week) with￾out further subcategorization. Although a smaller size 
cohort, the study by Tahir et al. may also be useful for 
the interested reader [52].
Finally, one publication [49] presents a meta-anal￾ysis of the literature in an attempt to provide reference

ranges. For the purposes of this review, that meta-anal￾ysis included multiple publications with overlapping/
redundant study populations, small sample size (<40 
subjects in most studies) and did not take into account 
marked differences in analysis methods noted above. 
While useful to display overall trends in the literature for 
the athletes heart, the aforementioned meta-analysis was 
therefore not included in this study.
Normal thickness of the compact left ventricular 
myocardium in adults
CMR acquisition parameters
Normal values of the thickness of the compact LV myo￾cardium have been shown to vary by type of pulse 
sequence (FGRE versus bSSFP) [53, 54]. For the purposes 
of this review, only bSSFP normal values are shown.
CMR analysis methods
In this review LV myocardial thickness refers to measure￾ments of the thickness of the compact LV myocardium 
obtained at end-diastole (Fig.  7). Papillary muscles and 
trabeculations are excluded from measurement of the 
thickness of the compact LV myocardium.
Measures of LV myocardial thickness vary by the plane 
of acquisition (SAx versus long axis) [55]. Measurements 
obtained on long axis images at the basal and mid-cavity 
level have been shown to be significantly greater com￾pared to measurements on corresponding SAx images, 
whereas measurements obtained at the apical level of 
long axis images are significantly lower compared to SAx 
images.
Demographic parameters
LV myocardial thickness is greater in men than women 
[14, 18, 25, 55, 56]. There are also small differences in 
LV myocardial thickness in relationship to ethnicity 
and body size, but these variations are not likely to have 
clinical significance [55]. Regarding age, one study of 120 
healthy subjects age 20–80 years reported an increase in 
myocardial thickness with age—starting after the fourth 
decade [56]. In the study by Kawel el al. of 300 normal 
individuals without hypertension, smoking history or 
diabetes, there was no statistically significant difference 
in LV myocardial thickness with age [55].
Studies included in this review
There are five publications of a systematic analysis of LV 
myocardial thickness based on bSSFP imaging at 1.5  T 
with a sample size>40 healthy subjects per gender and 
a detailed description of the measurement technique 
(Table  25). Dawson et  al. and Le Ven et  al. published 
measurements for all 16 segments (apex excluded) 
obtained on short axis images (Table 26) [14, 56]. Kawel 
et  al. published normal values of LV myocardial thick￾ness for long and SAx imaging for 12 and 16 segments, 
respectively (Tables 26, 27) [55]. Yeon et al. and Aquaro 
et  al. obtained measurements for only two myocardial 
segments on SAx images (Table 26) [18, 25].
Normal values of left ventricular trabeculation
CMR acquisition parameters
CMR methods used to assess LV trabeculation (Table 28) 
are based on the bSSFP technique to leverage on the 
blood-myocardial contrast it provides. The key methods 
are illustrated in Fig. 7.
CMR analysis methods
No uniformly accepted convention has been used for 
analyzing trabeculation. At least seven different meas￾urement approaches have been described (Table  28). 
Principally these methods measure trabeculation in 
the LV either in terms of the trabeculated layer’s thick￾ness, mass, volume, or fractal complexity, with or with￾out adjusting for the thickness, mass or volume of the 
adjacent compacted myocardium. Tables of normal 
values for trabeculation should specify the phase of 
the cardiac cycle in which measurements were taken 
together with imaging planes used. When reporting 
trabeculation mass, volume or fractal complexity, tables 
should specify whether papillary muscles were included 
or excluded in the trabecular assessment. Where

semi-automated segmentation of trabecular contours 
is undertaken, the type of algorithm used may impact 
subsequent results so the methods must specify the 
algorithm in detail [57].
Table 29 provides normal adult values for thickness of 
the trabeculated LV myocardium, on a segment-by-seg￾ment basis. Table  30 provides normal values for mass 
and volume of trabeculation. Trabeculation mass ratio 
has additionally been reported [12, 58, 59] but meas￾urement heterogeneity across studies, with respect to 
handling of the blood pool between trabeculations and 
inclusion/exclusion of papillary muscles, has led to dif￾fering definitions and no consensus normal values.
Tables  31 and 32 provide normal values for LV tra￾beculation measured as a fractal dimension. Four frac￾tal parameters for quantifying LV trabeculation [59] 
include global LV, maximal basal, maximal mid and 
maximal apical fractal dimension. To derive the global 
LV fractal dimension, the fractal dimensions from each 
slice in the LV stack (Fig. 7d) were averaged; to derive 
local fractal characteristics, the maximal fractal dimen￾sion in the basal, mid and apical thirds of the left ven￾tricle were recorded [59].
Normal values by this approach for global LV and 
maximal apical fractal dimension are presented in 
Table  31. Methodological developments for fractal 
analysis of the left ventricle are ongoing [60].
Demographic parameters
In the largest published reference cohort (n=323) [61], 
there was no relationship between maximal non-com￾pacted (NC)/compacted (C) wall thickness ratio and age, 
gender, race/ethnicity, height or weight.
For segment-by-segment (whole-heart) NC/C ratio [56], 
there was also no significant difference between genders, 
but age-related differences were present: the thickness of 
the trabeculated myocardium generally increased until the 
3rd decade and subsequently decreased. This trend was 
significant in the anterior (1, 7, 13) and apical inferior seg￾ments, but not in the remainder of segments [56].
Using the fractal dimension, ethnicity was shown to 
influence LV trabeculation parameters, with greater 
endocardial complexity (i.e. higher fractal dimension) 
demonstrated in healthy blacks as opposed to healthy 
whites, and greater complexity demonstrated in Whites, 
African American and Hispanics compared to Chinese 
Americans [62].
Studies included in this review
For the purpose of this review, only cohorts of 40 or more 
normal subjects using bSSFP CMR technique have been 
included. Data from population-based studies where 
exclusions for comorbidities was undertaken have also 
been included [61, 62]. The majority of reported normal 
values were derived at 1.5 T although a few 3 T studies 
have also been undertaken (see Table 28). Inclusion cri￾teria for reported tables included a full description of the 
subject cohort (including the analysis methods used), age 
and gender of subjects. One study evaluated elite male 
athletes which was not deemed to be representative of 
the average population and was therefore not included in 
this review [63].
The caliper-based linear measurement of thickness of 
trabeculation [61] has progressively evolved into more 
complex metrics: the maximal NC/C thickness ratio has 
been measured by at least four groups [58, 59, 61, 64] but 
reported normal values were too discordant for calcula￾tion of weighted means in this review (thus not shown in 
Table 29). The inter-study discordance of maximal NC/C 
parameters may stem from the subjective selection by 
readers of the visually most trabeculated segment/s for 
analysis (Fig. 7b). The largest of these studies, which also 
included reproducibility assessment, reported median 
values for normal adult maximal NC/C thickness of 2.2 
[5th and 95th percentile: 1.0, 4.6] [61]. Other studies 
opted for a more systematic segment-by-segment analy￾sis of thickness of trabeculation but still methodologies 
differed: Dawson et al. [56]. measured the maximal thick￾ness of trabeculated myocardium per segment (Fig. 7a), 
whereas Tizon [65] measured the average of 20–30 
(See figure on next page.)
Fig. 7 Example of measurement approaches for LV trabeculation. a End-diastolic thickness (in mm) of trabeculation according to the methodology 
in [56]: 3 slices representing base, mid and apex were selected from within the entire LV stack; trabeculated myocardial thickness was measured 
per slice; segment 17 excluded from analysis; authors do not clarify whether papillary muscles had been included or excluded from the trabecular 
measurement—in this reproduction we have excluded papillary muscles. b Maximal non-compacted (NC, red lines)/compacted (c, orange lines) 
wall thickness ratio according to the methodology in [61]: papillary muscles that were clearly observed as compact tubular structures were not 
included in the measurements; measurements in mm are shown in white and the maximal NC/C parameter highlighted in blue. c Trabeculation 
mass according to the methodology in [12]: the endocardial contour (red) was manually drawn; the trabecular contour (orange) was automatically 
segmented and papillary muscles (blue) that were included in the compact myocardial mass, were semi-automatically segmented; all slices of the 
LV short axis stack were analyzed. d Fractal dimension according to the methodology in [60]: using a semi-automatic level-set segmentation with 
bias field correction; all slices of the LV short axis stack are analyzed except for the apical slice; fractal dimensions per slice reported in the top right 
corner

Cardiac valves and quantification of flow
CMR acquisition parameters
Prospectively and retrospectively electrocardiogram 
(ECG)-gated phase contrast (PC) CMR sequences are 
widely available. Prospectively-gated sequences use 
arrhythmia rejection and may be performed in a breath 
hold. Retrospectively gated techniques are mainly per￾formed during free-breathing, often with higher spa￾tial and temporal resolution compared to the breath 
hold techniques [67]. Four-dimensional flow-sensitive 
(4D Flow) PC CMR techniques have shown promising 
initial results, but 2D PC flow techniques remains the 
most commonly used approach in daily clinical practice 
[68]. In addition to PC-CMR, valve planimetry—using

ECG-gated bSSFP CMR—can also be used to estimate 
stenosis or insufficiencies with good correlation to echo￾cardiographic measurements [69].
Measurements of flow are most precise when (a) the 
imaging plane is positioned perpendicular to the vessel of 
interest and (b) the velocity encoded gradient echo (Venc) 
is encoded in a through plane direction [70]. The slice 
thickness should be≤7 mm to minimize partial volume 
effects. Compared to aortic or pulmonary artery  flow 
evaluation, quantification of mitral or tricuspid valves is 
more challenging using PC-CMR due to through plane 
motion during the cardiac cycle [71].
The flow encoding velocity (Venc) should be cho￾sen close to the maximum expected flow velocity of 
the examined vessel for precise measurements. Set￾ting the Venc below the peak velocity results in aliasing. 
For the normal aorta and main pulmonary artery, maxi￾mum velocities usually do not exceed 150 and 90 cm/s, 
respectively.
Adequate temporal resolution is necessary to avoid 
temporal flow averaging, especially for the evaluation of 
short, fast, and turbulent jets within a vessel (e.g. aortic 
stenosis). For clinical routine, 25–30 ms temporal resolu￾tion is sufficient. The minimum required spatial resolu￾tion is less than one third of the vessel diameter to avoid 
partial volume effects with the adjacent vessel wall and 
surrounding stationary tissues for small arteries [70].
CMR analysis methods
For data analysis, dedicated flow software should be used. 
Most of the currently available flow software tools offer 
semi-automatic vessel contouring, which needs to be 
carefully checked by the examiner.
The modified Bernoulli equation (∆P=4× ­Vmax2
) is 
commonly used for calculation of pressure gradients 
using PC-CMR across the pulmonary or aortic valve [72, 
73].
Velocity measurements of valvular stenosis with high 
jet velocities may be inaccurate due to (A) partial volume 
effects in case of a small jet width and (B) limited tem￾poral resolution compared to the high velocity of the jet. 
Measurements are further affected by signal loss due to 
the high velocity that may lead to phase shift errors and 
dephasing. Misalignment of the slice relative to the direc￾tion of the jet may also lead to an underestimation of the 
peak velocity [74].
Mitral valve flow velocities and deceleration times can 
be quantified for assessment of LV diastolic function, in a 
manner analogous to that used with transthoracic echo￾cardiography (TTE). 2D PC derived trans-mitral flow 
velocities and deceleration times are strongly correlated

Demographic parameters
To our knowledge, no comprehensive studies have been 
performed to investigate the association between age, 
gender and ethnicity and valvular flow or valve plani￾metry in normal healthy subjects based on PC-CMR. 
Two recent studies using 4D Flow CMR investigated 
the relationship of aortic flow velocity with age and gen￾der, respectively [76, 77]. Callaghan et al. [76] compared 
measurements of mean peak systolic velocity obtained 
in the ascending aorta between 3 age groups and found 
a significant decrease with age. Garcia et al. [77] showed 
the mean aortic valve peak velocity was higher with 
greater age. In the study by Garcia et al. the differences 
in peak systolic velocity with gender were small and likely 
not clinically relevant [77].
Studies included in this review
There is good agreement between PC-CMR, bSSFP CMR 
planimetry, and echocardiography measurements. Amer￾ican Heart Association (AHA) criteria for grading valve 
stenosis or insufficiency is suggested [78, 79] (Table 33). 
To our knowledge, there is no publication from a large 
study of normal reference values of trans-valvular flow 
and valve planimetry based on PC-CMR measurements.
Mitral valve flow parameters for determination of dias￾tolic LV function are shown in Table 34.
Garcia, et  al. [77] and Callaghan, et  al. [76] have 
reported normal thoracic aorta flow parameters using 4D 
Flow CMR. Amongst other parameters, Garcia obtained 
measurements of peak systolic velocity where the trans￾valvular velocity reaches its maximum during peak sys￾tole (vena contracta region) (Fig.  8a) while Callaghan 
acquired measurement 6 cm proximal from the most cra￾nial point of the aortic arch centerline in the ascending 
aorta (Fig. 8b). Normal values of peak aortic velocity are 
given in Tables 35 and 36.
Normal aortic dimensions in the adult
CMR acquisition parameters
Three-dimensional contrast enhanced CMR angiogra￾phy (CMRA) has gained broad acceptance and is widely 
used for the assessment and follow-up of thoracic aortic 
diameters in the clinical setting. The multi-planar refor￾mation of CMRA images leads to an accurate measure￾ment perpendicular to the lumen of the vessel. However, 
motion caused by pulsation leads to substantial blurring 
of the vessel contour at the level of the aortic root, ham￾pering accurate diameter measurements [81]. The need 
of a contrast injection is another limitation for the use of 
this technique, particularly in patients who need multi￾ple follow up examinations and in population based study 
settings [82]. Alternatively non-contrast techniques such 
as an ECG- and respiratory-gated gadolinium-enhanced 
CMRA or 3D bSSFP sequence can be applied, enabling 
accurate measurements of aortic diameters including 
the aortic root [82]. However, due to the long acquisi￾tion times or lack of sequence availability, these methods 
may not be widely applied [81]. The magnitude image of 
PC CMR has also been used to measure diameters of the 
aorta [83]. Black blood techniques are used for a more 
detailed assessment of the aortic wall [84].
In 2D acquisitions, the imaging plane needs to be acquired 
correctly at the time of the scan; thus, any alterations in the

imaging plane due to breath-holding or patient motion will 
result in variability of measurements. Through plane motion 
during the cardiac cycle can be minimized with ECG gating 
[82].
Potthast and colleagues compared the diameter of the 
ascending aorta obtained by different CMR sequences 
to ECG-triggered computed tomography  angiogra￾phy  (CTA) as the standard of reference. They reported 
that ECG-gated navigator triggered 3D bSSFP sequence 
showed the best agreement with CTA [82].
CMR analysis methods
Beside the sequence type, imaging plane and cardiac 
phase (systole versus diastole), it is important to identify 
the anatomic locations of diameter measurements of the 
thoracic aorta (Fig. 9).
The sagittal oblique view of the LV outflow tract was 
used for measuring diameter at the level of the aor￾tic annulus, the aortic sinus, and the sinotubular junc￾tion (Fig.  10) [11, 85, 86]. Axial cross sectional images 
at predefined anatomic levels were used for measuring 
the ascending and descending aorta [86] as well as cusp￾commissure and cusp-cusp diameters at the level of the 
aortic sinus [85] (Fig. 11).
Luminal or outer to outer diameter of the aorta may 
be measured. The current SCMR guidelines on image 
post-processing recommend measurement of the outer 
contour in dilatation while measurements of the inner

contour should be obtained in the setting of stenosis [9]. 
In the tables below, the method is specified.
Demographic parameters
In the MESA, a large population based study, the diam￾eter of the ascending aorta has been shown to be larger in 
men compared to women even after adjustment for BSA 
[83]. In a publication by Le et al., however, the gender dif￾ference in diameters did not persist after normalization 
to BSA [11].
Several studies have shown an increase in aortic diam￾eter with age [11, 83, 85, 86]. The association of age 
with aortic diameter was more marked in the ascending 
aorta compared to the descending thoracic and abdom￾inal aorta, respectively [87, 88]. Further, age-related 
changes of the geometry of the thoracic aorta have been 
described. Age-related changes include increasing length 
of the ascending aorta and decreasing curvature of the 
aortic arch [89, 90].
In the MESA study, there were small differences in nor￾mal aortic diameter for Chinese and African American par￾ticipants compared to Caucasians. These differences were 
small however relative to measurement error and repro￾ducibility and therefore may not be clinically relevant [83].
Studies included in this review
Studies with normal values of aortic diameters based 
on measurements obtained in studies with 40 or more 
healthy subjects per gender have been included in this 
review (Table  37). There are five major publications 
regarding CMR-based measurements of the thoracic 
aorta in adults [11, 83–86]. There is substantial differ￾ence between the studies with respect to CMR sequences 
(cine bSSFP, PC CMRA and 3D-T1-black blood volume 
isotropic turbo spin echo acquisition), acquisition/ meas￾urement plane (cross sectional versus LV outflow tract 
view), measurement technique (luminal versus total 
diameter and area, respectively) and measurement sites 
of the aorta. Therefore, results of most studies are pre￾sented separately (Tables 38, 39, 40, 41). Details of image

acquisition and measurement technique of each study 
can be found in Table 37 and are described in the foot￾note of each table.
Weighted means were calculated based on the values of 
the diameter of the aortic root obtained on the 3D bSSFP 
sequence in LVOT view published by Burman, Davis and 
Le (Table 42) [11, 85, 86].
Normal aortic dimensions in children
CMR acquisition parameters
There is currently no consensus regarding the optimal 
CMR sequence to measure aortic diameters and areas 
in children. In three major publications documenting 
aortic dimensions in children (Table 43), measurements 
were obtained with three-dimensional contrast enhanced 
CMRA [91], gradient echo images [92] and phase con￾trast cine images [93].
CMR analysis methods
To minimize errors in measurement of aorta size, mul￾tiplanar reformation should be used to make double￾oblique measurements perpendicular to the centerline of 
the course of the vessel. Kaiser et al. demonstrated that 
aortic diameter measurements vary slightly based on 
plane orientation, with a mean difference between meas￾urements on cross-sectional and longitudinal images of 
0.16 mm and a coefficient of variability of 2.1% [91].
Aorta measurements should also be made in a consist￾ent manner with respect to the wall of the aorta—outer 
wall to outer wall, leading edge to leading edge, or lumi￾nal diameter. Kutty et  al. indicated that in their study 
measurements were made from outer wall to outer wall

[93]. Kaiser et al. and Voges et al. did not provide details 
on how measurements were made in this regard [91, 92].
Demographic parameters
Aortic diameters vary by BSA [91, 93] but do not show sex 
differences in children [92, 93]. Aortic area has not been 
shown to be dependent upon sex differences either [92].
Studies included in this review
Reference ranges for parameters measured in children 
are frequently presented in z-scores and reference curves 
using the LMS method as described under the LV/RV 
parameter section in children above.

that vary by CMR-technique, measurement technique

In this review we present (a) LMS parameters to cal￾culate z-scores for aortic cross-section area based on 
reference [92] (Tables  44, 45) (b) regression equations 
of normal aortic diameters measured at 9 different sites 
based on [91] (Table  46) and (c) normal areas of the 
ascending aorta from [93] (Table 47).
Due to the differences in acquisition sequences, 
measurement techniques, and presentation of results, 
weighted mean values are not presented.
Normal aortic distensibilityand pulse wave 
velocity (PWV) in adults
CMR acquisition parameters
Pulse wave velocity (PWV) calculations using a veloc￾ity-encoded CMR with phase contrast sequences allow 
accurate assessment of aortic systolic flow wave and the 
blood flow velocity. The sequence should be acquired at 
the level of the bifurcation of the pulmonary trunk, per￾pendicular to both, the ascending and descending aorta. 
The distance between two aortic locations (aortic length) 
can be estimated from axial and coronal cine breath hold 
bSSFP sequences covering the whole aortic arch [94]. 
Alternatively, sagittal oblique views of the aortic arch can 
be acquired e.g. using a black blood spin echo sequence 
[88].
Another parameter of aortic stiffness is aortic distensibility. 
The cross sectional aortic area at different phases of the car￾diac cycle is measured using ECG-gated bSSFP cine imaging 
to assess aortic distensibility by CMR. Modulus images of 
cine phase contrast CMR can be used as well [95].
CMR analysis methods
PWV is the most validated method to quantify arterial 
stiffness using CMR. PWV is calculated by measuring 
the pulse transit time of the flow curves (Δt) and the dis￾tance (D) between the ascending and descending aortic 
locations of the phase contrast acquisition [88]: Aortic 
PWV=D/ Δt (Fig. 12).
PWV increases with stiffening of arteries since the 
stiffened artery conducts the pulse wave faster com￾pared to more distensible arteries.
Aortic distensibility is calculated with the fallowing 
formula after measuring the minimum and maximum 
aortic cross sectional area [96]:
Demographic parameters
Greater ascending aorta diameter and changes in 
aortic arch geometry with greater age was associated 
with increased regional stiffness of the aorta, espe￾cially of the ascending portion. The relationship of

age with measures of aortic stiffness is non-linear and 
the decrease of aortic distensibility occurs particularly 
before the fifth decade of life [88]. Males have stiffer 
aortas compared to females [97].
Studies included in this review
Two studies with a total sample size of more than 40 
subjects reported reference ranges for PWV and/or 
distensibility in healthy subjects (Table 48): Kim et al. 
present reference ranges for PWV and distensibility 
for a cohort of 124 healthy Asian subjects [98]. Since 
both parameters have been shown to be highly age 
dependent, reference ranges are given per age decile 
according to the original publication [98]. However, 
sample size per decile was small (between 21 and 28 
subjects) and standard deviations are relatively large 
(Tables  49, 50). In the study by Eikendal et  al. refer￾ence values for PWV in young (25–35  years) healthy 
subjects are given (Table 51) [84].
With respect to PWV, in this review we present refer￾ence ranges for the distance between the ascending and 
the proximal descending thoracic aorta. This range is 
frequently measured since measurements at both loca￾tions can be obtained simultaneously on a single 2D 
acquisition at the level of the bifurcation of the pulmo￾nary artery. PWV for other distances (ascending to dis￾tal descending aorta and total PWV) can be found in the 
original publications [84, 98]. In addition to the ascend￾ing and proximal descending thoracic aorta, distensibility 
for the distal descending and the total aorta is presented 
in the original publication by Kim et al. [98].
Normal aortic distensibility and pulse wave 
velocity (PWV) in children
CMR acquisition parameters
In the only publication of aortic distensibility and PWV 
by CMR in children, distensibility was obtained on gradi￾ent echo cine images and pulse wave velocity was meas￾ured on phase-contrast cine CMR [92].

CMR analysis methods
Distensibility was calculated as (Amax – Amin)/Amin x (Pmax
– Pmin), where Amax and Amin represent the maximal and 
minimal cross-sectional area of the aorta, and Pmax and 
Pmin represent the systolic and diastolic blood pressure 
measured with a sphygmomanometer cuff around the 
right arm.
PWV was calculated as Δx/Δt, where Δx is defined 
as the length of the centerline between the sites of flow 
measurement in the ascending and descending aorta 
and Δt represents the time delay between the flow 
curve obtained in the descending aorta relative to the 
flow curve obtained in the ascending aorta (Fig. 12).
Demographic parameters
Aortic distensibility and PWV did not vary by gender. 
Aortic distensibility decreases with age and correlates 
with height, body weight and BSA. PWV has been shown 
to increase with age [92].

Studies included in this review
There is a single publication only of a systematic evalua￾tion of normal aortic distensibility and PWV in children 
(Table 52). In this review we present LMS parameters to 
calculate z-scores for distensibility of the ascending aorta 
and PWV based on reference [92] (Tables 53, 54). In the 
original publication LMS parameters for distensibility 
at 3 other levels of the thoracic aorta (aortic arch, aor￾tic isthmus and distal descending aorta) are presented in 
addition [92].

In the study by Burman et  al. listed in this review [99] 
dimensions of the pulmonary arteries were measured on 
bSSFP images (Table  55). Burman et  al. acquired cross 
sectional images of the main and the right and left pul￾monary artery based on an oblique sagittal image of the 
RV outflow tract and pulmonary trunk, respectively (for 
the main pulmonary artery) and an axial image acquired

at the level of the bifurcation of the main pulmonary 
artery (for the left and right pulmonary artery) (Fig. 13). 
With three-dimensional acquisition, reconstruction of 
the imaging plane can be performed after image acquisi￾tion using multiplanar reformation.
Other sequences could also be used to obtain dimensions 
of the pulmonary arteries such as a three-dimensional con￾trast enhanced CMRA with contrast timing optimized to 
enhance the pulmonary arteries. Non-contrast techniques 
include respiratory and ECG-gated 3D bSSFP sequence 
and cine phase contrast imaging. However, similar to the 
aorta, measurements of the pulmonary artery are expected 
to vary by the sequence type and might not be comparable 
[82]. In contrast to static sequences, acquisition of dynamic 
sequences, e.g. cine bSSFP, enable measurements at systole 
and diastole and calculation of distension.
CMR analysis methods
Luminal areas and diameters of the pulmonary arteries 
were measured on cross sectional images of the respective 
vessel at minimal diastolic and minimal systolic expan￾sion. Since the cross section of the vessel is usually not 
perfectly circular, data presented in Table  56 shows the 
mean diameter of two diameters that were acquired per 
vessel and phase calculated from the greatest diameter 
and the lesser diameter orthogonal to the greater diam￾eter. Percent systolic distension was calculated as [(maxi￾mum area – minimum area) * 100/minimum area].
Demographic parameters
Area and mean diameters of the pulmonary arteries 
are greater in men compared to women and greater in

the area and the mean diameter of the pulmonary arter￾ies slightly increase with BSA and age, while systolic dis￾tension decrease with age. For a detailed description of 
the relationship of the area, mean diameters and systolic 
distension of the pulmonary arteries with age and BSA 
please see [99].
Studies included in this review
One publication of reference ranges of the area, diam￾eters and distension of the pulmonary arteries in adults 
was found using a current CMR technique, sufficient 
sample size (>40 subjects per gender) and a clear descrip￾tion of image acquisition and measurements [99]. In the 
original publication, reference ranges were presented for 
age deciles for subjects between 20 and 79 years with 10 
subjects per decile and gender. However, since the differ￾ences between age deciles were small and might not be 
clinically relevant and for sample size considerations, in 
the current review only values of the entire cohort sepa￾rated by gender are presented.

CMR acquisition parameters
In analogy to dimensions of the pulmonary arteries 
in adults, different sequences might be used to obtain 
measurements. In the studies listed below, a contrast 
enhanced three-dimensional CMRA and a cross sec￾tional through-plane free-breathing phase contrast 
sequence were acquired to obtain the measurements 
[93, 100].

Knobel et  al. obtained measurements of the pulmonary 
arteries on reconstructed maximum intensity projection

In the study by Kutty et al. the maximal external diam￾eter of the main pulmonary artery (d1) was measured on 
the cross sectional magnitude image of the PC sequence 
in systole and also the diameter (d2) perpendicular to d1
[93]. After derivation of the radii (r1 and r2), the area was 
calculated as πr1r2.
Demographic parameters
In both studies a relationship between pulmonary artery 
diameter and BSA was described [93, 100]. Kutty et  al. 
could not find a significant gender difference of the size 
of the main pulmonary artery.
Studies included in this review
Two studies were identified presenting normal values 
of the size of the pulmonary arteries in children [93, 
100] (Table 57). Knobel et al. included 69 children rang￾ing from 2 to 20 years with a previous history of malig￾nancy that were assessed for potential port-a-cath related 
complications but normal cardiovascular anatomy and

no evidence of cardiovascular disease [100] (Table  58). 
In the study by Kutty et al. 105 normal healthy subjects 
between 4 and 20  years were included (data presented 
here; Table 59) and also subjects with repaired tetralogy 
of Fallot (not presented in this review) [93].
Due to the differences in sequence type, measurement 
technique and data presentation the normal values of the 
two studies are presented separately.
Normal values of myocardial T1 relaxation time 
and the extracellular volume (ECV)
CMR acquisition parameters
The field of myocardial T1 mapping has matured sig￾nificantly with several studies reporting T1 relaxation 
times for normal cohorts [101]. An Expert Consensus 
document on parametric mapping has been published 
providing recommendations for the practical clini￾cal application of T1, T2, T2*, and ECV mapping [102]. 
Most of the published myocardial T1 values have been 
acquired using variants of the Modified Look-Locker 
Inversion Recovery (MOLLI) technique [103] includ￾ing the shortened-MOLLI (ShMOLLI) [104] method. 
Saturation recovery based techniques such as saturation 
recovery single-shot acquisition (SASHA) are alternative 
techniques but have less clinical evidence to date [105]. 
Images are typically acquired in diastole to limit cardiac 
motion and respiratory motion correction.
Native T1 maps are acquired without a contrast agent. 
Post contrast T1 maps allow assessment of gadolinium con￾trast distribution, as these agents shorten the T1 relaxation 
time of water. T1 maps acquired 10–30  min following 
injection of an extra-cellular non-protein binding gado￾linium contrast agent can be used to quantify the extracel￾lular volume fraction (ECV) [102]. Post contrast T1 values 
have been performed following a bolus or primed infusion 
(Equilibrium-EQCMR) with good agreement of ECV val￾ues up to 40% [106]. While the hematocrit can be approxi￾mated from the T1 of the blood in the LV cavity (“synthetic 
T1”), assessment of hematocrit by blood sampling as close 
as possible in time to the CMR (less than 24 h) is preferred 
due to normal daily variation of hematocrit [102].
Factors affecting T1 relaxation time and ECV
There are a number of CMR acquisition factors that 
can affect the measurement of normal T1 and ECV val￾ues. Field strength has a significant effect on T1 values; 
with 3 T scans producing 28% higher native T1 and 14% 
higher post contrast T1 values when compared with 
1.5 T [107]. Post contrast T1 is also affected by the dose 
and relaxivity of the contrast agent used, contrast clear￾ance, and the time between injection and measurement 
[107–109]. There is also greater heterogeneity for a T1 
native normal range at 3  T [107, 110, 111]. Further, it 
has been shown that T1 varies by cardiac phase (diastole 
versus systole) and region of measurement (septal versus 
non-septal) [107]. ECV values are relatively unaffected by 
field strength (3 T versus 1.5 T). Both native T1 and ECV 
values have been shown to be less reliable in the infero￾lateral wall likely secondary to off-resonance effects [107, 
112].

A number of pulse sequence parameters can affect nor￾mal values. For MOLLI pulse sequences the number of 
inversions, number of images following each inversion, 
and number of recovery beats between inversion pulses, 
and the flip angle affect normal values [101]. Further￾more, the type of inversion pulses, which may be vendor 
specific can also affect T1 values.

The aforementioned factors contribute to the large het￾erogeneity of published reference ranges. Heterogeneity 
in published values are present even if the same manufac￾turer scanner was used at the same field strength with the 
same pulse sequence [101]. It is thus imperative to stand￾ardize local pulse sequences and sequence parameters, 
and to follow current consensus guidelines for establish￾ing site specific reference ranges [102]. In contrast to 
other CMR parameters, the SCMR has indicated that lit￾erature normal values of T1 relaxation times should not 
serve as absolute reference values, but rather than site￾specific reference ranges should be established [102].
CMR analysis methods
T1 maps are based on pixel-wise quantification of longi￾tudinal relaxation from the T1-weighted source images. 
The native T1 relaxation time, expressed in milliseconds 
(ms), is a composite measurement reflecting the signal 
from water within multiple compartments within the 
myocardium including myocytes, the blood pool, and 
the interstitial space [113]. Under assumptions of an 
equilibrium of gadolinium concentrations between the 
blood pool and interstitium, pre and post contrast blood 
and myocardial T1 values can be used to quantify the 
partition coefficient of gadolinium which when multi￾plied by (1-hematocrit) quantifies the fractional volume 
of the extracellular space. This ECV is expressed as a per￾centage [114].
Offline post-processing involves manually tracing 
endocardial and epicardial contours [109, 115] (Fig.  15) 
or placing a region of interest within the septal myocar￾dium. Inclusion of blood pool or adjacent tissue should 
be carefully avoided. Motion correction is generally used 
to correct undesired breathing motion. However, motion 
correction can only correct for in-plane motion and not 
through-plane motion. All methods, therefore, are vul￾nerable to partial volume effects.
Demographic parameters
In one large study, there was no relationship of age to 
myocardial or blood native T1 in male subjects aged 
11–69  years [116]. In female subjects there was a trend 
of lower native T1 with increased age (e.g. approximately 
20  ms lower for females less than 45  years vs. those 
greater than 45  years) [116]. Female subjects<45  years 
of age had a consistently higher native T1 then males, 
but after this age there was no difference in native T1 
by gender [116]. However, other studies have failed to 
demonstrate a significant trend in native T1 with age or 
gender [117]. For ECV measurement, ECV is reported to 
be higher in females than males, but data are conflicting 
regarding the relationship of ECV with age [110, 118].

The above relationships were formally assessed in a 
recent meta-analysis [101]. Overall, there was no signifi￾cant association between native T1 and age or percent of 
male participants at either 1.5 T or 3 T. However, there 
was a significant effect of gender with studies including 
more females on average having higher reported ECV 
values [101].
Studies included in this review
SCMR guidelines indicate each site should establish their 
own site specific reference ranges for T1 mapping param￾eters. In the absence of such data however, the weighted 
mean values and reference ranges for native T1 time and 
ECV based on publications of at least 40 healthy subjects 
extracted from Table 60 are summarized in Table 61.
Normal values of myocardial T2 relaxation times
CMR acquisition parameters
T2 relaxation time is the exponential time constant for 
the relaxation of transverse magnetization. To deter￾mine myocardial T2 time, a relaxation curve is con￾structed based on a CMR multi-echo pulse sequence. 
The most-commonly used technique utilizes a T2-prep￾aration module followed by either a single-shot bSSFP 
or GRE readout [150, 151]. This technique typically 
acquires 3 source images with effective echo times of 0, 
30 and 60 ms. 3–4 heart-beats are allowed for T1 relaxa￾tion between acquisition of source images, and data is 
acquired during a single breath-hold of 9–12 heart-beats. 
Inadequate time for complete T1-relaxation between 
source images can cause a T1-based bias in the T2 maps. 
The bSSFP technique has higher signal-to-noise but is 
more susceptible to off-resonance artifacts than the GRE 
technique. Other techniques are based on turbo-spin 
echo (TSE) or GRadient And Spin Echo (GRASE) acqui￾sition modes. TSE sequences consist of a 90° excitation 
followed by a train of 180° refocusing pulses, with each 
focusing pulse producing a spin-echo with a different 
echo time (TE). By creating images corresponding to 
each echo time in the train, T2 maps can be produced by 
fitting the T2-signal decay equation. TSE sequences are 
robust to off-resonance, but they can suffer from inaccu￾racies due to imperfect 180° pulses which result in stim￾ulated-echo contamination. GRASE sequences consist of 
a 90° excitation followed by a train of 180° pulses which 
produce a spin echo, and 2–4 gradient echoes. This tech￾nique is more efficient than TSE but is subject to simi￾lar biases as the TSE technique, and additionally is more 
sensitive to off-resonance effects due to the presence of 
gradient echoes and longer spacing between 180° pulses. 
Of note, performing multiple TSE sequences with differ￾ent effective-TEs are inaccurate for determining T2 and 
are not recommended.
Factors affecting T2 relaxation time
There are a number of factors which can affect the meas￾urement of normal T2 values. Field strength has a small 
effect on T2 values, with 3  T scans typically having T2 
values that are~6  ms shorter than those obtained on 
1.5 T scanners [152]. There are differences in measured 
T2 based on technical factors such as the type of pulse￾sequence used and the vendor. The T2-preparation pulse 
may be sensitive to off-resonance and B1 inhomogene￾ity effects; these effects are more severe at 3 T. T2-prep￾aration based on adiabatic radiofrequency (RF)-pulses 
have been shown to lessen these effects at 3 T. TSE and 
GRASE sequences are sensitive to specifics of the RF￾pulses which are vendor and implementation dependent. 
Similar to T1 mapping, it is imperative to standardize 
local pulse sequence parameters. As for T1 mapping, 
site-specific reference ranges should be established.

CMR analysis methods
T2 is the relaxation time (in milliseconds) of the trans￾verse magnetization. Similar to T1 assessment, to gener￾ate parametric maps of T2, the source images typically 
need to be aligned using non-rigid registration. Again, 
these techniques can correct  for in-plane motion but not 
through-plane motion. Both off-line and on-line tech￾niques have been used as for T1 mapping.
Demographic parameters
Published data on T2 values have sample sizes smaller 
than those of T1 methods. Thus, effects of demo￾graphic parameters in relationship to T2 times are 
not well established. One paper using GRASE demon￾strated a slightly higher native T1 in females as com￾pared to males (56.7 ms vs 54.6 ms; p = 0.008) at 1.5 T 
but no difference at 3  T. No significant differences

in T2 were seen as a function of age [145]. Another 
study showed no difference between male and female 
subjects when controlling for age, but did see a trend 
of lower T2 with increasing age [153]. Another study 
using T2-prepared bSSFP at 3 T demonstrated no sig￾nificant differences in T2 by age or gender [154].
Studies included in this review
SCMR guidelines indicate each site should establish 
their own site specific reference ranges for T2 map￾ping parameters. In the absence of such data however, 
the weighted mean values and reference ranges for T2 
on publications of at least 40 healthy subjects (com￾bined males and females) are shown in Table 62.
Normal values of myocardial T2* relaxation time
CMR acquisition parameters
Quantification of the T2* relaxation time plays an impor￾tant role for estimation of myocardial iron overload 
[156]. T2* time is also altered in myocardial necrosis and 
hemorrhage [102]. For quantification of the myocardial 
T2* time, the gradient-echo T2* technique with multiple 
increasing echo times is preferred over the spin-echo T2 
technique due to a greater sensitivity to iron deposition 
[157–159]. According to the current consensus state￾ment by the SCMR, a dark-blood multi-echo gradient 
echo sequence with 8 equally spaced echoes between 2 
and 18 ms should be used for T2*-mapping at 1.5 T [102]. 
Usually a single-breath hold technique is used. Normal 
values and a grading system for myocardial iron overload 
are available for 1.5 T [158].
CMR analysis methods
Gradient-echo T2* images are vulnerable to distortions 
of the local magnetic field e.g. by air-tissue interfaces. 
The myocardial septum is surrounded by blood on both 
sides, so susceptibility differences are less than in the 
lateral wall with improved image quality on T2* images. 
Therefore, T2* measurements are obtained by placing 
a region of interest on the interventricular septum of a 
midventricular short axis slice [102, 159] (Fig. 16).

T2* times are frequently reported as relaxation rate, 
representing the reciprocal of the time constant and cal￾culated as R2*=1000/T2*. The units of R2* is s
−1
 [159]. 
Cardiac iron concentration can be calculated from T2* 
values by the following equation: [Fe]=45 / (T2*)1.22, 
where [Fe] is the cardiac iron concentration in milligrams 
per gram dry weight and T2* in milliseconds [160].
Demographic parameters
T2* of the myocardium is not related to age [161]. To our 
knowledge the relationship between other demographic 
parameters and T2* has not been assessed.
Studies included in this review
The mean T2* of the myocardium (interventricular sep￾tum) is approximately 36 ms [161] at 1.5 T using a multi￾echo GRE sequence. T2*>20 ms is considered within the 
range of normal.
Depending on the risk to develop heart failure as a con￾sequence of myocardial iron overload, a grading system 
for disease severity has been published (Table  63) [102, 
156, 162].
Regional measurements and cardiac strain
CMR acquisition parameters
A number of imaging methods have been developed to 
acquire cardiac strain information from cine CMR. These 
methods include tagged cine CMR, PC-CMR, velocity 
encoded CMR, displacement encoding with stimulated 
echoes (DENSE), and strain-encoding (SENC) [163, 164]. 
Tagged CMR is a widely validated reproducible tool for 
strain estimation. The method is used in clinical studies 
and is considered the reference standard for assessing 
regional function [165, 166]. Recently feature-tracking 
CMR (FT-CMR) has been increasingly reported due to 
compatibility with existing cine CMR images [167].
CMR analysis methods
Cardiac strain is a dimensionless measurement of the 
deformation that occurs in the myocardium. Cardiac 
strain can be reported as three normal strains (circum￾ferential, radial, and longitudinal) and six shear strains—
the angular change between two originally mutually 
orthogonal line elements, with the more clinically 
investigated shear strain and the circumferential-lon￾gitudinal shear strain (also known as torsion). They can 
also be computed as fiber and cross-fiber strains which 
require anatomical knowledge of fiber architecture, or

as principal strains along the principal stretching and 
shortening directions [168]. Here, we concentrate on the 
widely reported circumferential and longitudinal strains. 
Although frequently reported, radial strain is less repro￾ducible because of the reduced resolution of imaging in 
the radial direction as opposed to the circumferential or 
longitudinal directions.
There are a number of different methods to quan￾tify strain: registration methods, feature-based tracking 
methods, deformable models, Gabor Filter Banks, optic 
flow methods, harmonic phase analysis (HARP) [169], 
and local sine wave modeling (SinMod) [163]. Technical 
review papers for these methods can be found in the fol￾lowing literature [167, 170–172].
HARP is one of the most widely reported and validated 
methods for analyzing tagged CMR for cardiac strain, in 
part due to its large scale use in the MESA study [169, 
173]. Strain patterns are reported according to the 16 or 
17 segment AHA  model. Consistent manual tracing of 
the endocardial and epicardial contours is necessary to 
reproducible strain results. With tagged CMR, midwall 
strain is preferred to epicardial and endocardial strain to 
maximize the amount of tagging data available for strain 
calculations [172, 174]. With HARP analysis such as that 
used in the MESA trial [169], careful selection of the first 
harmonic is necessary. Figure  17a shows an outline of 
tagged CMR analysis using HARP.
FT-CMR has shown diagnostic and prognostic util￾ity across a variety of pathologies. Currently, FT-CMR 
software from TomTec (TomTec Imaging Systems, 
Unterschleissheim, Germany), QStrain (Medis Medical 
Imaging Systems, Leiden, The Netherlands) and CVI42 
(Circle Cardiovascular Imaging Inc., Calgary, Canada) 
are widely used in clinical research for calculation of LV 
strains. Similar to tagged CMR from HARP, strains are 
reported in the 16 or 17 segment models.
Segmentation of the myocardium (either semi-auto￾mated or completely automated) at the start of the car￾diac cycle is an essential first step across all software. 
The software records a characteristic pixel pattern (an 
area of pixels typically in the order of 10–15 mm2
) in the 
reference frame; an area with an identical pixel pattern 
is recognized in the next frame that maximizes certain 
similarity metrics [167, 175]. This procedure is repeated 
for all pixels in each image and for each frame to track 
the borders throughout the whole cardiac cycle with con￾straints for smoothness of the deformation field applied. 
FT-CMR tracking quality is largely governed by the qual￾ity and resolution of the pixels at the endocardial and epi￾cardial borders which are feature-rich as compared to the 
mid-myocardium. This method has been extended to vol￾ume data by tracking voxels to obtain 3D FT-CMR [176]. 
Figure  17b shows an outline of the concept underlying 
strain analysis by FT-CMR.
Fig. 17 Illustration of strain computation using the Harmonic Phase (HARP) tool on tagged CMR images (a–d) and from feature tracking on 
cine CMR images (e–h). In HARP, first a semi-automated frequency analysis of the tagged CMR image (a) is performed to identify the harmonic 
peaks in each of the tag directions (b), filters are then applied to isolate the peaks and obtain the corresponding phase maps from which Eulerian 
strain maps (c) can be computed. Subplot (d) shows the strain curve at the mid-ventricular level for an asymptomatic volunteer obtained based 
on tracking of the user-defined mesh (a). In feature tracking of cine CMR images, endo- and epicardial contours are drawn at end-diastole (e) or 
end-systole (g). A characteristic pixel pattern in the order of a few millimeters squared is identified as a template. The software then tries to discern 
a similar pattern in the subsequent frame from which displacement of the pixels is computed (f). This is repeated through the entire cycle to obtain 
displacement from which strain is computed. Subplot (h) shows the strain curve at the mid-ventricular level computed from feature tracking. The 
tagged and cine CMR images and the strain curves were from the same participant

Demographic parameters
Using both tagged CMR and FT-CMR, several studies 
report greater age is associated with decrease in peak 
circumferential or longitudinal shortening [176–178]. 
In tagged CMR and a few FT-CMR reports, gender also 
affects normal values. Cardiac strain values for women 
are higher than those of men [66, 176, 179–181]. How￾ever, some FT-CMR reports showed no association of 
circumferential or longitudinal strains with age or gender 
[26, 177].
Studies included in this review
Several studies have presented cohorts for determining 
normal LV  strain. For the purpose of this review, only 
cohorts of 40 or more normal subjects using SPAMM 
(spatial modulation of magnetization tagging) or FT￾CMR have been included. Inclusion criteria include a full 
description of the subject cohort (including the analysis 
methods used), age and gender of subjects. Table 64 rep￾resents a summary of publications reporting normal val￾ues for strain that fit the criteria. We have only included 
reference values for global values of strain as the inter￾reader and inter-study reproducibility of regional strain 
values vary widely between published reports.
With tagged CMR, normal midwall circumferential 
strain values are relatively comparable between stud￾ies [182, 183] (Table  65). With 2D FT-CMR, small dif￾ferences between published results exist for reference 
values, probably due to inter-vendor differences [26, 66, 
177, 179]. The reference ranges of normal circumferential 
strains from FT-CMR (Table 66) are comparable to those 
obtained from tagged CMR (Table 65). Strain values are 
traditionally reported as more negative values meaning 
greater contractility. For both global  circumferential 
and global longitudinal strain, a strain value of approxi￾mately -14% is the limit of normal; values more positive 
than this are considered to be abnormal.
Given the inclusion criteria noted above, one publica￾tion [176] used 3D FT-CMR (Table 67). The mean values 
and reference ranges were lower compared to 2D FT￾CMR and tagged-CMR.
Myocardial perfusion
Myocardial perfusion has been quantified with 
T1-weighted dynamic imaging during the first pass of a 
contrast bolus by semi-quantitative methods that derive 
dimensionless indices (e.g. the upslope of myocardial 
signal intensity changes during initial contrast enhance￾ment). Alternatively, absolute estimates of MBF may be 
determined (in units of ml per g of tissue and per minute 
(ml/g/min)). To derive absolute measures of blood flow, 
the CMR signal intensity changes must be converted to 
be linearly proportional to contrast concentration. This 
assumption may not hold true at high contrast concen￾trations (e.g. in the blood pool). Instead, low-dose bolus 
injections of contrast agent (e.g.<~0.04  mmol/kg of 
Gd-DTPA) with saturation correction [184] or special 
pulse sequences are used for CMR perfusion (e.g. “dual￾sequence” [185], dual-bolus techniques [186, 187]) to 
provide linear measures of gadolinium concentration.
CMR acquisition parameters
Normal values for quantitative myocardial perfu￾sion measures have been obtained by ECG-gated, 
T1-weighted dynamic imaging during the first pass of 
an injected contrast bolus using gradient-echo image

readouts without or with bSSFP. Echo-times are kept as 
short as possible for any of these image acquisition meth￾ods to minimize T2*-related signal loss. T1-weighting 
is generally maximized by using saturation-recovery 
magnetization preparations. Semi-quantitative param￾eters depend on contrast dosage and injection protocol, 
sequence technique and acquisition parameters. The 
normal ranges for semi-quantitative parameters should 
therefore only be used as reference when the same 
protocol settings are employed. MBF (in units of mL/
min/g) should be independent of the specific perfusion 
imaging protocol settings. However, a specific technique 
may still introduce a bias to under or over-estimate MBF.
In clinical use, myocardial perfusion imaging is gen￾erally performed at rest and during vasodilator stress. 
Adenosine and regadenoson are currently the most fre￾quently used pharmacological stress agents for myocar￾dial perfusion imaging and have supplanted dipyridamole 
in this role. Adenosine and regadenoson have similar 
hemodynamic effects on coronary  artery blood flow 
[188]. The choice of pharmacologic stress agent is mostly 
determined by considerations of patient comfort, safety 
and cost. Regadenoson is more expensive, but better tol￾erated than adenosine. A unique application of myocar￾dial perfusion imaging is its use in combination with the 
cold-pressor test to assess coronary endothelial function 
[189, 190].
Fig. 18 a The quantification of myocardial perfusion proceeds from the segmentation of images acquired during the first pass of contrast through 
the heart to delineate myocardial segments and a region in the center of the LV blood pool for the arterial input. This example shows one short-axis 
image for a mid-slice LV level. b For each myocardial segment one obtains a signal-intensity versus time curve. A useful semi-quantitative parameter 
for the assessment of the perfusion in a myocardial segment is the upslope, which is estimated from a fit to approximately 3–5 points during the 
initial myocardial contrast enhancement. c An analogous upslope parameter can be extracted from the first pass peak of the arterial input function. 
A perfusion index can be calculated from the ratio of the two upslopes as shown in the formula below (a), and accounts for some changes in the 
arterial input between rest and stress. d Absolute estimates of myocardial blood flow in ml/min/g can be obtained from the myocardial contrast 
enhancement curves and the arterial input function by fitting to a kinetic model for contrast enhancement, or, as done for this example, to estimate 
the myocardial impulse response by constrained deconvolution. Constraints are that the impulse response should be a monotonically decaying 
function of time, and requiring a relatively smooth, “regularized” impulse response. Myocardial blood flow (MBF) is estimated from the peak 
amplitude of the impulse response. e The ratio of myocardial blood flows during stress, divided by MBF at rest provides the most accurate estimate 
of the coronary flow reserve. In comparison, other ratios of perfusion indices (e.g. upslope index) for stress and rest systematically underestimate the 
flow reserve but may still prove useful for the detection of disease, assuming that one has established the normal range of the index.

CMR analysis methods
All quantitative approaches for CMR myocardial perfusion 
are based on signal-intensity versus time curves that depict 
the contrast enhancement during the first pass and recircu￾lation of an injected contrast bolus. The myocardial perfu￾sion images are segmented along the endo- and epicardial 
borders, and the ventricular wall is divided into segments 
following a standardized segmentation model for cardiac 
perfusion studies (Fig. 18).
The most widely used semi-quantitative parameter has 
been the up-slope parameter for initial myocardial contrast 
enhancement. Because the upslope derives from signal￾intensity curves with arbitrary units, the value of the up￾slope depends on the image acquisition settings and on 
the characteristics of the contrast bolus. For this reason, 
the myocardial up-slope parameter is generally normal￾ized by the up-slope of the arterial blood pool of the LV to 
obtain a dimensionless perfusion index. This index is quan￾tified during resting conditions and “stress” at maximal 
vasodilation (i.e. hyperemia) after infusion of a pharmaco￾logical agent (e.g. adenosine). The coronary flow reserve is 
the ratio of the “stress” index, divided by “rest” index. We 
refer below to this parameter as the “up-slope” perfusion 
reserve.
Absolute quantification of the myocardial perfu￾sion reserve entails estimating MBF in ml/min/g. MBF 
quantification can be based on tracer-kinetic modeling, 
or by using a deconvolution technique that is based on 
Zierler’s central volume theorem [191]. In either case it 
is important to have an accurate depiction of the arte￾rial input of contrast to a myocardial region of interest, 
which in practice is approximated by the arterial contrast 
enhancement observed in the LV cavity. The myocardial 
perfusion reserve is estimated as “stress” MBF, divided by 
“rest” MBF. Nevertheless, hyperemic MBF by itself is also 
a useful measure of the maximal vasodilator response 
and its normal range is also provided by some studies in 
the literature. Rest MBF increases in proportion to the 
cardiac workload, and the rate-pressure product (RPP) is 
used as measure of cardiac workload to provide an RPP￾normalized MBF value (rest MBF/RPP), whose normal 
range is narrower in healthy persons than for the rest 
MBF without any adjustment for RPP.
Demographic parameters
In the CMR study by Wang et  al. [192], rest MBF was 
higher in women than in men; this agrees with previ￾ous studies in healthy  subjects using positron emission 
tomography [193]. Men have a lower hyperemic MBF 
compared to women, with adjustment for coronary heart 
disease risk factors [192]. Although male sex carries a 
higher risk for coronary heart disease, few studies of 
myocardial perfusion in healthy subjects have considered 
gender-related differences in MBF. The coronary flow 
response to the cold-pressor test is also higher in women 
compared to men [194].
Studies included in this review
There are two publications reporting reference val￾ues of absolute MBF at rest and under pharmacological 
stress with a sufficient sample size (>40 healthy sub￾jects) (Table  68). The original study published by Wang 
et al. included subjects from the MESA population with 
comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes [192]. 
However, for the purpose of this review, a re-analysis of 
[192] was performed for a subset of 99 healthy subjects 
of the cohort by one of the authors (MJH). Values are 
given for the entire cohort and for men and women sepa￾rately. In the other study by Brown et al. reference ranges 
are presented for the entire cohort of 42 healthy subjects 
[195]. Although in both studies images were acquired by 
means of a T1 weighted saturation recovery prepared 
single-shot GRE sequences, normal reference ranges

differ substantially. Therefore, in this review we abstained 
from calculation of weighted mean values and present 
reference ranges given in the two publications separately 
(Table 69).
There is a single study presenting reference ranges 
of myocardial perfusion in children [196] (Table  68). 
Although the sample size is small (n=20) and children 
have cardiovascular pathologies (e.g. atrial and ventricu￾lar septal defects), data is presented here since a study of 
myocardial stress perfusion imaging in a larger subset of 
entirely healthy children seems not feasible (Table 68).
Artificial Intelligence (AI)‑based segmentation 
methods for analysis of cine MRI
Currently no AI-based normal values have been pub￾lished in the literature. In recent years however, major 
improvements have been made in the development of 
automated CMR segmentation methods based on AI 
technology using so called Convolutional Neural Net￾works (CNN). Most published work report methods 
for automated LV and RV segmentation in Cine CMR 
[3, 197–203]. CNN based methods have also been pre￾sented for automated quantification of atrial dimensions 
[2, 204], myocardial scar tissue from LGE [205, 206], T1 
mapping [207], aortic flow [208] and disease classifica￾tion [209]. Given the potential importance of this topic to 
the field of CMR, this section summarizes relevant litera￾ture in this area and provides a summary of the publicly 
available CMR data sets relevant to AI segmentation of 
CMR data.
CNN-based automated image segmentation methods 
rely on training data, i.e. images with known segmen￾tation result, to derive a neural network with multi￾ple nodes, layers and weighting parameters that can be 
applied to unseen images to label every pixel in the 
image. The structure of the neural network varies among 
publications, but many are based on or are similar to the 
UNET structure introduced by Ronnenberger et  al. in 
2015 [210]. The applicability of a CNN implementation is 
highly dependent on the data that was used to train the 
weights in the CNN. Ideally, the training data is repre￾sentative for the data for which the CNN is to be used. 
Important considerations include the mix of patholo￾gies, mix of CMR scanner vendors and variation in CMR 
acquisition parameters in the training set. Many pub￾lished CCN methods for CMR image segmentation are 
based on data sets that have been made publicly available 
in the setting of so called challenges, i.e. competitions

in which participants are invited to develop the best 
segmentation algorithm for a given type of data [211]. 
Table 70 lists the most relevant public CMR Cine CMR 
data sets that have been used for this purpose.
Validation of CNN based segmentation methods is 
based on comparing the results of automated segmenta￾tion with manual results from a trained observer. Com￾monly used geometrical validation metrics include the 
Dice overlap, Haussdorf distance and average distance 
between contours [198]. Additionally, derived quantita￾tive parameters from either automated or manual con￾tours can be compared. As manual analysis is subject to 
observer bias and variability it can only serve as surrogate 
gold standard. Some papers report the observer variabil￾ity of manual analysis in order to assess how the limits 
of agreement of an automated method compare with the 
limits of agreement within or between manual observers.
CNN-based image segmentation methods are being 
introduced in commercially available image analy￾sis software packages. The question arises whether 
results from such automated methods can be used 
interchangeably with results from manual image anal￾ysis. Although CNN’s are designed to replicate the 
image segmentation performed by an expert observer, 
it is conceivable that relevant differences may occur, 
especially in myocardial pathologies which were not 
well represented in the cohort that was used to train 
the CNN.
Studies included in this review
Table  71 lists 11 studies presenting CNN based image 
segmentation methods for automated analysis of CMR 
imaging data. Studies are included based on having either 
used a well described public data set for training and test￾ing, or a dataset of>300 subjects selected according to a 
properly described inclusion protocol. Most published 
work have used publicly available datasets for train￾ing and testing of algorithms for LV [198–202, 204] or 
RV [198, 200, 202–204] segmentation in short-axis cine 
CMR. The use of public data sets for algorithm training 
and validation enables objective comparison of the per￾formance of the methods. Due to the relatively small size 
of training sets used and the limitation in variation in 
patient pathology, scanner manufactures, field strength 
and scanning protocol, it is uncertain how these meth￾ods perform on routine clinical CMR data. However, 
the above studies do convincingly demonstrate the high 
potential of CNN based image segmentation.
There are several studies for which AI methods were 
developed and applied to larger cohorts of subjects. Bai 
et  al. presented a CNN method that was trained on a 
large dataset of 4875 subject scans of the UK BioBank 
cohort [2]. This method provides automated segmenta￾tion and quantification of short-axis and long-axis cine 
CMR for all four heart chambers. It was shown that the 
method provides excellent segmentation results when 
applied to cases from the UK Biobank cohort. However,

for application in clinical patients, the method demon￾strated sub-optimal performance. Retraining the net￾work by including additional cases of a clinical cohort did 
result in better results in patient data.
In the study of Tao et  al. multi-center, multi-vendor, 
multi-pathology data was used to train and test vendor 
specific CNNs and a mixed-vendor CNN [3]. The authors 
showed that the CNN trained using a mix of data from all 
centers, vendors and pathologies had the highest overall 
performance. This indicates that it is feasible to use the 
same optimally trained CNN across multiple centers, 
vendors and patient pathologies.

A retrospective clinical validation of a commercial 
image analysis software tool was presented by Backhaus 
et  al. [212]. In a randomly selected cohort of 300 CMR 
examination LV and RV parameters were automatically 
derived using a commercial software tool (SuiteHEART, 
NeoSoft, Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA) incorporating 
CNN based image segmentation. The agreement between 
manual and automated LV parameter assessment was 
good (Bias in LV-EF:−2.5%±5.9%), while for RV 
assessment the agreement was lower (Bias in RV EF: 
5.8%±9.6%). As expected, the agreement between man￾ual and automated analysis was lowest in cases of poor 
image quality and in patients with abnormal cardiac 
anatomy.
Bhuva et  al. used another approach to assess the per￾formance of CNN based image segmentation as com￾pared to manual analysis [197]. In their study a CNN LV 
segmentation method was trained on 599 subjects and 
tested on scan-rescan data of 110 patients with multiple 
pathologies. It was shown that automated image seg￾mentation yielded similar scan-rescan reproducibility as 
manual image analysis, which suggests that automated 
segmentation is a viable alternative to manual analysis in 
a clinical setting.
Conclusions
CMR enables quantification of various functional and 
morphological parameters of the cardiovascular system. 
Advantages of a quantitative evaluation are a better dif￾ferentiation between pathology and normal conditions, 
grading of pathologies, monitoring changes under ther￾apy, and evaluating prognosis and the possibility of com￾paring different groups of patients and normal subjects.
Hence, here we present an updated and expanded ver￾sion of the “normal value CMR review”. This review has 
provided reference values and factors affecting these 
parameters on current CMR techniques and sequences. 
Due to continuing publications in the field and new tech￾niques transferred from research tools into clinical prac￾tice existing reference ranges need to be updated and 
values for new techniques integrated.
