Abstract
Ischemic preconditioning (IPC) is a potent renoprotective strategy which has not yet been translated successfully into
clinical practice, in spite of promising results in animal studies. We performed a unique systematic review and meta-analysis
of animal studies to identify factors modifying IPC efficacy in renal ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI), in order to enhance the
design of future (clinical) studies. An electronic literature search for animal studies on IPC in renal IRI yielded fifty-eight
studies which met our inclusion criteria. We extracted data for serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen and histological renal
damage, as well as study quality indicators. Meta-analysis showed that IPC reduces serum creatinine (SMD 1.54 [95%CI 1.16,
1.93]), blood urea nitrogen (SMD 1.42 [95% CI 0.97, 1.87]) and histological renal damage (SMD 1.12 [95% CI 0.89, 1.35]) after
IRI as compared to controls. Factors influencing IPC efficacy were the window of protection (,24 h = early vs. $24 h = late)
and animal species (rat vs. mouse). No difference in efficacy between local and remote IPC was observed. In conclusion, our
findings show that IPC effectively reduces renal damage after IRI, with higher efficacy in the late window of protection.
However, there is a large gap in study data concerning the optimal window of protection, and IPC efficacy may differ per
animal species. Moreover, current clinical trials on RIPC may not be optimally designed, and our findings identify a need for
further standardization of animal experiments.

Introduction
Ischemic preconditioning (IPC) is a potent protective strategy in
which application of a brief episode of ischemia and reperfusion
(I/R) results in tolerance to subsequent ischemia/reperfusion
injury (IRI) [1–3]. The conditioning stimulus has been shown to be
effective when applied either to the target organ itself (local IPC ;
LIPC [4]) or to a remote organ or tissue (remote IPC; RIPC [5]).
LIPC and RIPC were both originally discovered in the dog heart,
and have been successfully reproduced in a variety of animal
species, using various organs, e.g. heart, intestine, brain, liver and
kidney. There is a large variety in the IPC protocols used: the
preconditioning stimulus may be one continuous ischemic period,
or it may be comprised of 2 or more cycles of brief ischemia.
Moreover, the interval between the preconditioning stimulus and
the index ischemia may vary, and positive results in animals have
been found for both short intervals of a few minutes or hours (the
so-called early window of protection), as well as for long intervals
of days or even weeks (late window of protection).
Thus, IPC poses a promising alternative to existing treatments
for IRI in humans, since current strategies to reduce this important
and common clinical problem are inadequate. Next to the heart,
the kidney is one of the major organs of interest for clinical
application of IPC. Its high energy demand and intricate
microvascular network render the kidney especially sensitive to
IRI, which is a major cause of kidney injury in e.g. renal artery
stenosis and renal surgery [6,7]. Furthermore, renal IRI is a major
cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and is associated
with delayed graft function after transplantation, renal damage in
cardiac and aortic surgery, and shock [8–11]. In animal models,
both LIPC and RIPC have been shown to be effective tools to
protect the kidney (e.g. [12,13]).
Where do we stand in terms of the translation of IPC to beneficial
treatment for patients? LIPC has not been studied in the human
kidney, but several clinical studies have been conducted in the heart:
a number of studies have investigated LIPC in patients undergoing
coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery, which collectively
show that LIPC reduces inotrope requirements, ventricular
arrhythmias, and shortens intensive care unit stay [14]. For RIPC,
several clinical trials have been performed for cardiac as well as
renal IRI, but their outcome is not clear-cut: many studies report
protective effects of RIPC after CABG surgery, heart valve surgery,
or abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, but not all findings have been
positive ([15–18] and recently reviewed in [19]).

Thus, even though the protective effect of LIPC and RIPC on
renal IRI has been shown in many animal studies, translation of
IPC to the clinic has, as yet, not been successful. The variety of
IPC protocols used in clinical trials may be one of the reasons for
this ambiguity, i.e. in some studies, the stimulus could have been
suboptimal or incorrectly applied. There is no consensus on how
many ischemic stimuli should be applied, and what the duration of
the ischemic and intermediate reperfusion periods should be. It is
unclear whether the early or late window of protection is most
effective. Furthermore, it is unknown which patient-related factors
such as age, gender or co-morbidities play a role.
Meta-analysis and systematic review of preclinical (animal)
studies have previously been used to optimize experimental animal
models and to improve the design of clinical trials [20–22]. In the
case of IPC, meta-analysis on animal study data may provide
valuable indicators to optimize the IPC protocol, as well as the
window of protection in humans. It has been shown that proper
analysis of animal experiments can also improve the decision
making in whether or not to start a clinical trial. In addition, this
approach can be used to perform a quality assessment of the
current literature, including measures to avoid bias (e.g. random￾ization, concealment of allocation and blinded outcome assess￾ment). As such, meta-analysis of existing literature on animal
models may improve future animal research in the field, thereby
contributing to the Refinement and Reduction of animal
experiments, as proposed by the Animal Research: Reporting In
Vivo Experiments [23] and Gold Standard Publication Checklist
[24] guidelines.
This report presents innovative methods in reviewing animal
studies, i.e. a systematic review and meta-analysis of the efficacy of
IPC in experimental models of renal IRI. We set out to 1) provide
a complete and systematic overview of all literature available on
the effects of IPC (both local and remote) on renal IRI; 2) report
summary estimates of efficacy based on meta-analysis; 3) identify
factors modifying the efficacy of IPC in renal IRI, to inform the
design of future clinical trials; and 4) provide insight in the quality
of literature in the field of IPC and renal IRI in animal models.
Analysis
Literature search strategy, inclusion and exclusion criteria
The present review was based on published results of animal
studies on the effects of IPC on renal IRI, which were identified
via a systematic computerized search in PubMed and Embase.
The inclusion criteria and method of analysis were specified in
advance and documented in a protocol. The databases were
searched for published articles up to October 19th 2011. The full
search strategies for PubMed and EMBASE are included in
Appendix S1, and involved the following search components:
‘‘animal’’ [25,26], ‘‘kidney’’, ‘‘ischemia reperfusion injury’’ and
‘‘preconditioning’’. Studies were included in the systematic review
if they fulfilled all of the following criteria: 1) the study assessed the
effect of remote or local IPC on renal IRI; 2) the study was
performed in animals in vivo; 3) the study was an original full paper
which presented unique data. Studies were excluded if 1) the renal
IRI model involved cold storage of the kidney or 2) the study was
performed only in genetically modified animals. Study selection
was performed independently by two reviewers (TM and KW) on
the basis of title and abstract. In case of doubt, the whole
publication was evaluated. Differences were clarified by discussion
with a third investigator (MW). No language restrictions were
applied. If necessary, papers in languages other than English were
translated by scientists (native speakers for that particular
language) within the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical
Centre.
Study characteristics and data extraction
The following study characteristics and data items were
extracted from the studies included: animal species, strain, sex,
number of animals in treatment and control groups, measures of
randomization, measures of blinding, number of animals excluded
for statistical analysis, reason for exclusion of animals, reported
outcome measures and results. Bibliographic details such as
author, journal, and year of publication were also registered.
Three outcome measures were assessed: serum creatinine, BUN
and histological renal damage. For histology, data could be
extracted if the authors used the Jablonski [27] score for renal
damage, or an adapted version of this scoring system.
Data were extracted if raw data or group averages, standard
deviation (SD) or standard error (SE), and number of animals per
group (n) were reported, or could be recalculated. For 30 articles,
relevant outcome measures or study details were not reported. We
therefore contacted these authors via e-mail and received response
from eight authors, six of which provided additional data. For two
papers, authors reported using 6–8 animals per group and we
included these data using n = 6 animals [28,29]. If the number of
animals was stated less specific (e.g. .3 animals or 4–8 animals),
and the exact numbers could not be retrieved by contacting the
authors, data were not included. If SE was reported, this was
converted to SD for meta-analysis. If a study contained separate
groups for each gender, or several preconditioning protocols, these
groups were analyzed as if they were separate studies. If two or
more identical groups existed, the data were pooled for these
groups. If outcomes were measured at several time points, we
chose the time point at which efficacy was greatest. In 8 out of 11
cases, this was 24 h post ischemia, which was also the most
common time of measurement overall (see Table S1). When data
were presented only graphically, we contacted authors to obtain
the numerical values. If these were not available, data were
measured using digital image analysis software (ImageJ; http://
rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/).
Assessment of methodological quality
We designed a 16-point rating system to assess the methodo￾logical quality of the included publications (see Table S2 and
legend for details). Concerning the number of excluded animals,
we assumed that there had been no exclusion if the number of
animals per group mentioned in the materials and methods section
was identical to the number stated in the figure legends or results
section.
Data synthesis and statistical analyses
Data were analyzed using Review Manager Version 5.1
(Copenhagen, The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane
Collaboration, 2011). Meta-analysis was performed for the
outcome measures serum creatinine, BUN and histology score,
by computing the standardized mean difference (SMD; the mean
of the experimental group minus the mean of the control group
divided by the pooled SD of the two groups). To account for
anticipated heterogeneity, we used random effect models in which
some heterogeneity is allowed. Subgroup analyses were pre￾defined and performed for all outcome measures, and were used to
assess the influence of variables on IPC efficacy, as well as to
explore possible causes for heterogeneity. The five subgrouping
variables were: timing of index ischemia (late or early window of
protection), preconditioning protocol (fractionated or continuous),
site of preconditioning (LIPC, RIPC or both), animal species (rat

or mouse) and gender (male, female or both). Differences between
subgroups were determined by calculating the difference between
the respective SMDs (DSMD) and confidence interval (CI) of the
difference. Furthermore, subgroup interaction analysis was
performed in an attempt to further explain the expected study
heterogeneity: we compared smaller sets of experiments by
combining two subgrouping variables, e.g. early-RIPC vs. early￾LIPC. Unless indicate otherwise, data are presented as SMD and
95% CIs.
For each outcome measure, we assessed the possibility of
publication bias by visually evaluating the possible asymmetry in
funnel plots. Finally, we investigated whether study methodology
influenced the results of our meta-analysis. Pre-specified sensitivity
analysis was performed to assess whether the chosen cut-off point
for early vs. late window of protection influenced the outcome of
this subgroup analysis.
Results
Study selection and characteristics
The electronic search strategy retrieved 253 records from
PubMed and 270 articles from EMBASE, 310 of which were
unique. Seventy-seven papers met our inclusion criteria. On the
basis of predefined criteria, 19 reports were excluded and the
remaining 58 articles were retrieved in full (see Figure 1).
The characteristics of the included studies are summarized in
Table S1. There was a large variation in study characteristics. In
76% of the 58 included studies, the delay between the
preconditioning stimulus and the index ischemia was ,24 h,
which we considered to be the early window of protection. Eleven
studies (19%) assessed protection in the late window of protection
(timing of index ischemia $24 h after IPC), and 3 studies (5%)
reported data for both late and early window(s) of protection. For

the early window of protection, the delay between IPC and index
ischemia was 4 to 40 min (average 967 min). For the late window
of protection, this was 24 h up to 12 wk (average 17623 d). In 28
of the 58 studies (48%), the ischemic preconditioning protocol
consisted of one continuous stimulus. Twenty-two studies (38%)
used only fractionated protocol(s), i.e. 2 to 5 cycles of brief
ischemia and reperfusion, whereas 8 studies employed both
fractionated and continuous stimuli. The majority of studies
focussed on the protective effects of LIPC on renal IRI. However,
5 studies assessed the effects of RIPC, using hind limb, intestine,
liver or subphrenic aortic occlusion as remote stimuli. In 4 studies,
both LIPC and RIPC of one kidney to its contralateral
counterpart were performed (either intentionally, or as a result
of a bilateral preconditioning stimulus and a unilateral index
ischemia). Out of all 58 included studies, 14 were conducted in
mice (24%), 34 in rat (59%), and 10 in other species, namely rabbit
(7%), dog (5%) and pig (5%). Eight out of 58 studies (14%) were
performed in female animals, 37 in males (64%), and 4 studies
used animals of both genders (7%). Nine studies did not report the
gender of the animals.
Methodological quality of studies
The results of the quality assessment of the 58 studies included
in this systematic review are shown in Table S2 and Figure 2. On
average, studies reported 9 out of 16 characteristics (59610%).
The lowest score was 5 out of 15 items (33%), and the highest
scoring studies reported 12 items out of 14 (80%). In the quality
assessment of clinical trials, randomization, blinding, and
description of withdrawals are key quality measures. However,
only 40% of the animal studies included in this systematic review
reported randomization of the animals across treatment groups.
Out of the 39 studies in which renal histology was an outcome
measure, 74% reported blinding of the outcome assessment. No
study reported blinding for any other outcome measure. Only
29% of the studies reported the number of animals excluded, 64%
of which did not state the reason for exclusion. Although the
strong influence of body temperature on renal damage has been
shown in both large and small animal models, 36% of the studies
did not report whether the body temperature of the animals was
controlled.
Meta analysis of outcome measures
Results for the outcome measure serum creatinine are
summarized in Table S3 and Figure 3. Thirty-two articles studied
the effect of one or more IPC protocols on serum creatinine after
renal IRI. The analysis contained 62 experiments, including data
for 512 control animals which underwent renal IRI only, and 492
animals that underwent IPC + renal IRI. In 36 experiments, the
SMD and 95% CI indicated that IPC significantly reduced the
IRI-induced rise in serum creatinine. One study reported a
negative effect of IPC on serum creatinine [30]. Overall analysis
showed that IPC reduced serum creatinine after IRI (1.54 [1.16,
1.93], p,0.00001). Overall study heterogeneity was high (83%).
Subgroup analysis showed a beneficial effect of IPC for all
subgroups, except for female (notably, this subgroup contained
only two experiments and was therefore excluded from further
statistical analysis). We also found a subgroup effect of the variable
‘window of protection’ (Table S2, filled squares). The DSMD and
CI of the difference for early vs. late was 2.43 [1.29, 3.57],
indicating that the late window of protection of IPC was more
effective in reducing serum creatinine than the early window.
Subgroup analysis indicated a higher IPC efficacy in studies
conducted in mouse vs. rat (Table S2, triangles; DSMD 1.7 [1.5,
1.90]). For other species (dog, pig, rabbit) subgroups were too
small to perform reliable subgroup analysis. No difference in IPC
efficacy was observed for continuous vs. fractionated; DSMD 0.46
[20.30, 1.22]), or males only vs. groups of mixed gender (DSMD
0.38 [20.60, 1.36]). For site of preconditioning, no differences
were found when comparing the subgroups LIPC vs. RIPC
(DSMD 0.06 [20.98, 1.10]), LIPC vs. LIPC +RIPC (DSMD 1.01
[20.44, 2.46]) or RIPC vs. LIPC+RIPC (DSMD 0.95 [20.73,
2.63]).
Results for the outcome measure BUN are summarized in
Table S4 and Figure 4. Seventeen articles studied the effect of one
or more IPC protocols on BUN after renal IRI. In 20 out of 29
experiments, the IRI-induced rise in BUN was significantly
reduced in animals undergoing IPC, when compared to a control
group that underwent IRI only (overall effect size 1.42 [0.97,
1.87]; p,0.00001). Overall study heterogeneity was high (76%).
Subgroup analysis showed that the beneficial effect of IPC on
BUN was present in all subgroups. Between-subgroup analysis
revealed a higher IPC efficacy in mouse vs. rat (Table S3, triangles;
DSMD 2.12 [0.48, 3.76). No effect was found for the window of
protection (early vs. late; DSMD 1.25 [20.05, 2.55]) or the IPC
protocol (continuous vs. fractionated; DSMD 0.96 [20.03, 1.95]).
Furthermore, the site of preconditioning did not influence IPC
efficacy: LIPC vs. RIPC, LIPC vs. LIPC +RIPC and RIPC vs.
LIPC+RIPC, respectively DSMD 0.2 [20.69, 1.09]), DSMD 0

[21.03, 1.03] and DSMD 0.2 [20.82, 1.22]. Subgroup analysis
could not be performed for the variable ‘gender’, because of
insufficient data.
Results for the outcome measure renal histology are summa￾rized in Table S5 and Figure 5. Twenty-six experiments from 15
studies reported the effect of IPC on the Jablonski score for renal
histology. Eight studies using a histology score not comparable
with Jablonski’s were excluded from analysis. Data included
contained 205 control and 191 IPC-treated animals. Overall, IPC
had a significant renal protective effect of 1.12 [0.89, 1.35].
Overall study heterogeneity was 63%.
Subgroup analysis showed that the beneficial effect of IPC on
histology was present in all subgroups. Between-subgroup analysis
could only be performed for the variables window of protection,
IPC protocol, gender and animal species, because of insufficient
numbers of experiments in the other subgroups. No significant
differences between subgroups were found (early vs. late, DSMD
1.8 [20.07, 3.67]; continuous vs. fractionated, DSMD 0.3 [20.50,
1.10]; males vs. mixed gender, DSMD 0.25 [20.58, 1.08]; rat vs.
mice, DSMD 0.55 [20.14, 1.24]).
Subgroup interaction analysis
In an attempt to further explain the expected study heteroge￾neity, subgroup interaction analysis was performed for all
subgroup interactions which contained three or more experiments.
Study heterogeneity was not notably reduced by combining
subgroup variables and remained on average 8066% for serum
creatinine, 62623% for BUN and 47630% for renal histology.
The analyses revealed no significant differences in the interaction
between subgroups, and did therefore not alter the results of the
subgroups analysis. Interestingly, for serum creatinine, the
subgroup interactions early-RIPC and continuous-RIPC did not
show an overall effect of IPC, whereas early-LIPC and continuous￾LIPC did show the protective effect. This may indicate that the
positive effect of an early window of protection, or the benefits of a
continuous IPC protocol are less pronounced for RIPC than for
LIPC. However, because of the small number of experiments in
these subgroups interactions (six and three experiments, respec￾tively), these results must be interpreted with care.
Publication bias
The presence of publication bias was assessed for all outcome
measures. Visual analysis of funnel plots revealed that small,
negative studies appeared to be underrepresented (data not
shown). This was especially true for serum creatinine and BUN,
and to a lesser extent for renal histology data.
Sensitivity analysis
To assess the robustness of our findings, we undertook a
sensitivity analysis by redefining the cut off-point for the early
window of protection at a later time point (,48 h) or an earlier
time point (,6 h). This did not significantly alter the outcome of
any of the outcome measures (data not shown).

Discussion
Here we report a unique systematic review and meta-analysis of
current literature reporting experimental animal models of IPC in
renal IRI. Three important outcome measures were assessed,
namely serum creatinine, BUN and histological renal damage
quantified by Jablonski score. For all three, protective effects of
IPC were observed, i.e. IPC reduced serum creatinine (1.54 [1.16,
1.93]), BUN (1.42 [0.97, 1.87]) and histological damage (1.12
[0.89, 1.35]) after IRI, when compared to control animals
undergoing renal IRI only. Importantly, in the clinical setting,
serum creatinine currently remains the gold standard to assess
renal function. In rodents however, questions have been raised
regarding the reliability of creatinine for measuring renal function,
since the impact of tubular creatinine excretion on creatinine
clearance is even larger in mice than in humans [31]. We therefore
put forward that other outcome measures, such as BUN and/or
renal histology may also be of great value when translating animal
study results to the human setting. Furthermore, other renal
damage markers such as Kidney Injury Molecule-1 (KIM-1) and
Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin (NGAL) are gaining
ground in clinical practice [32]. Reporting these markers in both
animal and human studies may provide further information for the
translation of animal study data to the human setting.
We performed subgroup analysis to investigate several pre￾defined factors which we hypothesized to modify the efficacy of
IPC in renal IRI, namely: window of protection (early or late), IPC
protocol (continuous or fractionated), site of preconditioning
(RIPC, LIPC or both), species (mouse or rat) and gender (male,
female or mixed). The protective effects of IPC were persistent in
all subgroups, for all outcome measures, except for female (only 2
experiments). Based on the latter observation, we propose the need
for future studies should in females, since it has been shown that
there is a significant difference between males and females for
cardiac IPC efficacy (e.g. [33]).
For serum creatinine, the window of protection influenced the
efficacy of IPC: IPC was more effective when conducted .24 h
before index ischemia (late window of protection), as compared to
an early widow of protection (,24 h before index ischemia). We
observed the same trend towards higher efficacy in the late
window of protection for BUN and renal histology. The cut-off
point of ,24 h for the early window could be redefined at ,6 h or
,48 h without significantly influencing these results, since the vast
majority of experiments (93%) investigated a time window of
either ,40 minutes, or .4 days. The remaining 7% of the
experiments concerned a time window of 6–24 h between IPC
and IRI. Thus, there is a large gap in these data which makes it
difficult to assess the optimal window of protection for IPC.
Nevertheless, our data strongly indicate that the late window of
protection might be more effective to reduce renal IRI as
compared to the early window. This finding is particularly
interesting since almost all clinical trials currently registered at
Clinicaltrials.gov investigating the effects of LIPC and RIPC use
only the early window of protection. To our knowledge data on
the efficacy of combined activation of the early and late window in
humans is lacking.

The second variable which influenced IPC efficacy was animal
species: for serum creatinine and BUN data, IPC was more
effective when performed in mice vs. rats. This suggests that mouse
models of renal IPC may be more sensitive when compared to rat,
and are thus the preferable models for future animal studies.
Furthermore, this finding implicates that IPC efficacy is species￾specific, and therefore the protective effect may be greater, or less
pronounced in large animals and humans. This illustrates the
difficulty in directly translating results from animal studies to the
human setting, and further studies in large animals and humans
are necessary to clarify this issue.
No significant differences were observed for the variables IPC
protocol (continuous vs. fractionated) or site of preconditioning
(LIPC, RIPC or both). The latter finding is interesting, since the
use of LIPC in clinical practice is limited because of the risk of
damage to major vascular structures, and the fact that even brief
ischemia may damage the target organ in vulnerable patients.
RIPC therefore has more potential for clinical application, since
the IPC stimulus can be applied to e.g. a limb, which is easy to
handle and relatively resistant to IRI. Our finding that RIPC and
LIPC are equally effective indicates that RIPC has an at least
equal potential for translation to the clinic, although it must be
noted that only two studies used the limb as remote organ.
Subgroup analysis of the serum creatinine levels in animals
undergoing simultaneous LIPC of one kidney and RIPC of the
contralateral kidney show a trend towards higher efficacy (Table
S2, filled circles), indicating that a combination of LIPC and RIPC
may have an additive effect. However, this result must be
interpreted with care, because of the low number of experiments
included.
Methodological quality of studies
Our assessment reveals that there is much to gain in terms of the
methodological quality of animals studies in this field. Key
characteristics of scientific practice, and measures to avoid bias,
such as characteristics of the subject population, randomization,
blinding and exclusion criteria, were infrequently reported. A
number of recent systematic reviews show that this is the case in
many fields of animals research. For scientific and ethical reasons,
it is urgent that the standards routinely applied in human research
become standard of practice in animal research as well. While it is
possible that some authors merely failed to report these details,
there is reason for concern, since it is unclear whether there is a
significant difference between the reported study quality and the
actual study quality. For this reason, better reporting of animal
studies is crucial. Regrettably, there appears to be an inverse
correlation between the impact factor of the journal in which the
study is published, and the required detail of the materials and
methods description [24]. The high heterogeneity of the data
presented in this systematic review may be explained in part by the
differences in study quality, as well as the lack of consensus and
general standards of practice in animal studies. It has proven
difficult to obtain missing data by contacting authors directly,
which further emphasizes the importance of adequately reporting
animal studies. However, in spite of insufficient reporting,
systematic review and meta-analysis of current publications aid
in making possible bias transparent, and can provide us with
valuable new insights, which will support the translation of animal
data to the clinical setting.
Strengths and limitations
The major strength of our study is that as far as we are aware,
we are the first performing a systematic review and meta-analysis
on renal protection by IPC in animal studies. We were able to
include a large number of studies per outcome measure, which
enabled us to investigate the effect of several subgroup variables.
Some potential limitations should be discussed. Firstly, the
extracted data are highly heterogeneous, which is most likely due
to a large variety in experimental designs used and the variation in
study quality. The fact that our subgroup interaction analysis did
not notably reduce heterogeneity supports this notion. Although
we have tried to account for this heterogeneity by using a random
effects model and performing subgroup and sensitivity analysis,
pooling of the results may not be appropriate for all subgroups.
Therefore, differences between (small) subgroups should be
interpreted with caution and be used to generate new hypotheses,
rather than for drawing final conclusions. However, all studies
provide information on the association between IPC and IRI in
the animal kidney, and are thus valuable for this systematic review.
Secondly, the included studies may be subject to publication
bias. Visual analysis of funnel plots revealed that only small,
negative studies appeared to be underrepresented in current
literature on IPC in renal IRI. Asymmetry was most notable in
serum creatinine and BUN data. This may indicate that
publication bias is present, which could cause overestimation of
the effect sizes. Importantly, funnel plot asymmetry can result from
non-publication of negative results, but may also be caused by
other factors, such as true study heterogeneity, or differences in
study quality [34]. Our finding that the study quality is rather
heterogeneous may therefore explain part of the funnel plot
asymmetry.
Clinical implications
Both LIPC and RIPC (and also the combination of the two),
appear to have the potential to reduce IRI, and since RIPC by
brief limb ischemia has the advantage of being safe and easy to
perform, the latter has the greatest potential for clinical practice.
In contrast to the variety of IPC protocols used in animal studies,
current clinical trials on RIPC in renal IRI are using similar
preconditioning protocols, namely fractionated IPC stimuli, and a
short delay between IPC and index ischemia (early window of
protection). The current review indicates that even though this
approach might be effective, efficacy could be even higher in the
late window of protection. Future studies should be designed to
investigate the optimal window of protection in patients, taking
into account the possible difference between acute and delayed
ischemic preconditioning. Whether a combination of the two is
additive or even synergistic requires further testing in animal and
human models as well.
It is important to realize that, to date, no studies (animal or
human) have investigated the effect of co-medication and co￾morbidities such as diabetes, hypertension or obesity, on IPC in
renal IRI. For the heart, it has been shown that medication and
co-morbidities influence IPC efficacy (reviewed e.g. in [35]).
Similarly, differences in IPC efficacy between genders may
indicate that the optimal IPC stimulus is different in males vs.
females. We propose that future clinical studies should be designed
to optimize IPC efficacy for certain patient groups, and that
animal studies in this area can inform the design of such clinical
trials. Furthermore, a better mechanistic insight is needed in the
cause of the observed interspecies difference. These data will give
us a clue whether translation to humans is feasible.
Conclusion
The currently applied approach of systematic review and meta￾analysis indicates that, in animal studies, IPC has an overall
protective effect on the kidney, since it reduces serum creatinine,
blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and renal damage as assessed by

histology after IRI. We found that IPC is more effective in
reducing serum creatinine when the IPC stimulus is applied
.24 h before index ischemia (late window of protection), a trend
which was also observed for BUN and renal histology data.
Furthermore, serum creatinine and BUN data showed an effect of
animal species on IPC efficacy: IPC was more effective when
performed in mice vs. rats. No significant differences were
observed for the variables site of preconditioning (local, remote
or both) or IPC protocol (continuous vs. fractionated). Our review
indicates that current clinical trials on RIPC may not be optimally
designed, and further optimization may be necessary for successful
translation to the clinical setting.
