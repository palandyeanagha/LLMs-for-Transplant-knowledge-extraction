Abstract
Background: It has been demonstrated in many studies that quality of life can be improved after
liver transplantation in patients with liver disease. Nevertherless quality of life improvement in
specific groups of transplantated patients such as those with Familial Amyloid Polineuropathy hasn't
yet been explored. The present study aimed to compare the change in quality of life following liver
transplantation between patients with Familial Amyloid Polineuropathy (FAP) and patients with
liver disease.
Results: Patient's mental quality of life showed an improvement in all liver disease patients, and a
worsening in FAP patients, resulting in a significant difference between the two groups. Regarding
physical quality of life, although a similar improvement was seen in both groups, FAP patients had
significantly less improvement than the sub-group of decompensated liver disease (Child-Pugh B
and C).
Conclusion: It is concluded that liver transplantation has a less beneficial impact in FAP patient's
physical quality of life, probably because they are not so much disabled by their disease at the
moment of liver transplantation. The lesser improvement in mental quality of life of FAP patients
may be due to their particular psychological profile and greater expectations towards
transplantation.
Background
It has been demonstrated in many studies that quality of
life can be improved after liver transplantation in patients
with liver disease and that this improvement is present 6
months after transplantation [1-4].
Familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) is an autossomal
dominant multisystemic fatal disorder characterized by a
progressive peripheral and autonomic neuropathy with
neural and systemic amyloid deposits [6,7]. The disease is
caused by a mutant gene in chromosome pair 18. The
amyloid protein in type 1 FAP of Portuguese, Swedish and
Japanese origin is the variant of transthyretin 8TTR, in
which methionine is a substitute for valine at position 30
(TTR Met). More than 90% of this TTR Met 30 is produced
by the liver and the rest by choroid plexus. The most con￾Published: 15 July 2009

sensual way to treat FAP is liver transplantation in the ini￾tial stage of the disease, to prevent neurological
deterioration. Patients with FAP are almost asymptomatic
when they are transplanted in contrast to other liver trans￾plant candidates that usually have a disabling chronic
liver disease [6,7]. FAP patients might have particular per￾sonality and psychiatric characteristics compared with
liver transplanted patients [8]; furthermore, several stud￾ies have shown an improvement in survival and in the
progression of the disease in FAP patients after liver trans￾plantation [8-11]. However, to our knowledge, there are
no prospective studies in the literature investigating FAP
patient's quality of life after liver transplantation.
The aim of the present prospective study was to compare
the change in quality of life after liver transplantation
patients with FAP and liver disease.
Methods
1) Participants
A group of 66 consecutive transplant candidates, attend￾ing the out-patient clinics of a Liver Transplantation Cen￾tre in Lisbon, were studied between March 1, 2006 and
December 1, 2007. Written informed consent was
obtained from all participants, and the study protocol was
approved by the institutional review committee. These
patients were assessed before transplantation and 6
months after being transplanted.
2) Quality of Life evaluation
We used the SF-36 Portuguese validated version, a self rat￾ing questionnaire developed by the Medical Outcome
Trust [12], to investigate certain primary aspects of quality
of life. The SF-36 has been widely used under a range of
different medical conditions and shown to have adequate
reliability and validity. The first four subscales refer to
physical aspects, and the last four scales, mental aspects:
Physical Functioning, Physical Role Limitation, Bodily
Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Functioning, Emo￾tional Role Limitation and Emotional Well Being. Physi￾cal aspects mostly refer to physical capability to perform
normal daily activities. The mental dimension mostly
refers to social aspects of life the degree to which illness
interferes with emotional well-being, and social roles.
Total values were computed for physical and mental com￾ponents of health-related quality of life by averaging the
eight weighted subscales using the coefficients generated
by Hays et al [13] in the Medical Outcomes Study.
3) Medical Evaluation
Diagnosis of chronic liver disease was done by a hepatol￾ogist. Child-Pugh classification was used to evaluate liver
disease severity.
Diagnosis of FAP was done by a neurologist. To evaluate
the severity of FAP a Portuguese classification was used
[14]: Level 0 – asymptomatic; Level 1 – sensitive and/or
dysautonomic symptoms without neurological signs;
Level 2 – sensitive and/or dysautonomic symptoms + neu￾rological signs (sensitive); Level 3 – sensitive and/or dys￾autonomic symptoms + neurological signs (sensitive￾motor) in lower limbs with independent walking; Level 4
– neurological signs in lower and upper limbs (sensitive
or motor) walking without help; Level 5 – neurological
signs (sensitive or motor) in lower and upper limbs, in
wheel chair; Level 6 – confined to bed.
5) Statistical Methods
Statistical analysis was done using the SPSS 13.0 for Win￾dows® software package. Descriptive data were presented
in absolute frequencies, percentages, mean values, stand￾ard deviations.
We constructed a new variable (DIFQL) to measure the
difference between quality of life measured 6 months after
transplantation (QL6M) and before transplantation
(QLBT), (DIFQL = QL6M-QLBT). This new variable was
used to measure the change in mental health (mentalD￾IFQL) and physical health (physicalDIFQL) components
of quality of life, after liver transplantation.
Once the two groups are very different between them,
comparing absolute values wouldn't reflect the real differ￾ence between the groups. Thererefore, a new variable that
reflects the actual variation of quality of life after trans￾plantation was created (DIFQL).
Results
1) Demographic and Medical Data
Regarding medical diagnosis, 20 patients had FAP and 46
had chronic liver disease (CLD). Among the patients with
chronic liver disease, 13 had Alcoholic Liver Disease
(ALD), 7 hepatitis C associated cirrhosis (HCAC), 2 had
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 2 Primary Biliary Cir￾rhosis, 1 Familial Progressive Cholestasis, and the others
had Mixed Diagnosis (7 ALD + HCC; 7 HCAC + HCC; 2
HCAC+HCC+ALD; 1 HCC+ Virus B Liver Disease; 1
Hemochromatosis + LC), unknown cause 3 (Tables 1, 2,
3 and 4).
In FAP group (n = 20), 11 patients were male, and mean
age was 31.8 years. Seven patients belonged to Level 1
FAP, with symptoms but without neurological signs, and
the other thirteen to the Level 2 and 3, with neurological
signs (sensitive/motor) but walking without help.
In the liver disease group (n = 46), 32 were male and
mean age was 52.4 years. Twenty one patients belonged to
Child-Pugh class A, 14 to B class and 9 to C class.

The main reasons by which non PAF Child-Pugh class A
patients were transplantated were liver cancer and severe
liver disease complications (such as hemorrhagic compli￾cations).
The mean hospital stay was 20.3 days. Within the whole
sample, 26 patients had some kind of complication along
the 6 first months after transplantation (15 had an infec￾tion, 4 a vascular complication, 5 a biliar complication, 3
an acute rejection). Patients that died after transplantation
or had to be retransplantated were excluded from the
study.
No statistical associations where found between demo￾graphic characteristics and presence of complications, and
quality of life scores.
2) Quality of Life Differences
In the FAP group, the absolute scores for quality of life's
mental and physical components were, before transplan￾tation 63.00 and 58.00, and after transplantation 55.92
and 66.00. In the non FAP group, the absolute scores for
quality of life's mental and physical components were,
before transplantation, 60.00 and 48.00 and after trans￾plantation 66.76 and 67.47.
Compaired to normative values of quality of life (for
healthy pearsons) (physical component:73.08; mental
component:67.14) [15] the scores of the FAP and nonFAP
groups in the pre-transplantation period were signifi￾cantly lower. Twelve months after transplantation there
were no significant differences between non FAP group
and normative data, but quality of life mental component
was significantly lower for FAP patients, compaired to
normative data (p = .002).
For FAP group, mental DIFQL was -7.08 and physical
DIFQL was 8.00, for liver disease's group mental DIFQL
was 18.47 and physical DIFQL 16.76.
We compared mental DIFQL and physical DIFQL
between FAP group and liver disease group. We found that
there was a statistical significant difference between the
two groups for mental DIFQL (z = -3.04, p = .002) but not
for physical DIFQL (z = -1.348, p = .178).
Considering that the absence of difference in physicalD￾IFQL, might be due to the paucity of symptoms in Child￾Pugh class A patients, the liver disease group was divided
into 2 groups: A and B+C, and compared each of these
subgroups with the FAP. By doing so, a significant differ￾ence for mentalDIFQL (z = -2.056, p = .040) was found
between FAP patients and Child-Pugh A, and a significant
difference for mentalDIFQL (z = -4.21, p = .000) and for
physicalDIFQL (z = -3.321, p = .000) between FAP
patients and severe liver disease patients (Child-Pugh B/
C).
Discussion
Most studies found an improvement in mental and phys￾ical quality of life components after liver transplantation
[1-4]. However the great majority of these studies evalu￾ated decompensated liver disease patients, with a very dis￾abling disease at the time of liver transplantation.
To our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating mental
and physical quality of life FAP patients after liver trans￾plantation, and in fact this is a very particular group of
liver transplanted patients. FAP patients have a genetic
disease, invariably fatal without treatment, and are now
being transplanted at a very early stage, with a paucity of
symptoms [6,7]. There are some studies about the clinical
progression of these patients after transplantation, the
majority demonstrating a slowing in the progression of
neurological symptoms [8-11].
The fact that liver transplantation had a less beneficial
impact in mental quality of FAP patients is difficult to
explain. It cannot be explained by the paucity of symp￾toms that FAP patients have before transplantation, since

when comparing them with liver disease patients with few
symptoms, such as Child-Pugh A, they still have a worse
evolution of their mental quality of life, although the
improvement in physical quality of life was similar.
One possible explanation could relate to a particular psy￾chological profile of these patients. Telles-Correia 2008 et
al found that there was a high prevalence of psychiatric
diagnosis (mostly depression and anxiety) in familial
amyloid polyneuropathy patients waiting for transplanta￾tion and that these patients had a different personality
characteristics comparing to other liver transplant candi￾dates [7]. This might be due to the emotional stress of
being exposed to a chronic sensation of being carrier of a
fatal genetic disease [16]. This chronic emotional stress
added to a maintained exposure to doubt and uncertainty
feelings might explain the development of great expecta￾tions towards liver transplantation, and partially explain
the difference towards mental quality of life changes
found in the present study. These hypotheses must be
confirmed by other studies.
On the other hand, our findings that liver transplantation
has a less beneficial impact in physical component of
quality of life in FAP patients is easier to explain, because
FAP patients are not so much disabled by their disease at
the moment of liver transplantation, than decompensated
liver disease patients.
One of the main weaknesses of the present study is the
small number of FAP patients included, what relates to
the difficulty of doing a prospective study in such a rare
disease. More studies in this area are needed to confirm
our findings and further explore our knowledge of the
FAP psychological profile, in order to better deal with
these patients and improve their quality of life after liver
transplantation.
Conclusion
We concluded in this prospective study that liver trans￾plantation has a less beneficial impact in FAP patient's
physical quality of life, probably because they are not so
much disabled by their disease at the moment of liver
transplantation. The lesser improvement in mental qual￾ity of life of FAP patients may be due to their particular
psychological profile and greater expectations towards
transplantation.
