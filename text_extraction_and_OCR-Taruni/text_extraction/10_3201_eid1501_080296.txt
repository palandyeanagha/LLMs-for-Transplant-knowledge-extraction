We characterized 42 hepatitis E virus (HEV) genotype 
3 strains from infected patients in France in 3 parts of the 
genome and sequenced the full-length HEV genotype 3f ge￾nome found in Europe. These strains are closely related to 
swine strains in Europe, which suggests zoonotic transmis￾sion of HEV in France.
Hepatitis E is a water-borne infection in developing 
countries and is believed to spread zoonotically in 
industrialized countries (1). Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a 
positive-sense RNA virus that belongs to the family Hep￾eviridae (2). The coding region consists of 3 discontinuous 
open reading frames (ORFs). One region within ORF1, the 
hypervariable region, displays substantial genetic diversity 
(2). HEV strains are classifi ed into 4 genotypes, and it was 
recently proposed that HEV genotypes are divided into 24 
subtypes (3). Although genotypes 1 and 2 have been found 
exclusively in humans, genotypes 3 and 4 have been found 
in humans and animals such as pigs, boars, and deer. Geno￾types 1 and 2 have been isolated in tropical and subtropi￾cal countries in Asia, Africa, and America; genotype 4 has 
been found only in Asia. Genotype 3 has been identifi ed 
almost worldwide, but the distribution of its 10 subtypes 
varies greatly. Subtypes 3a and 3j strains have been mainly 
identifi ed in North America; 3b, 3d, and 3g strains in Asia; 
and 3c, 3e, 3f, 3h, and 3i strains in Europe (3). The fi nding 
of several cases of HEV infection in southern France (4,5) 
prompted us to characterize the diversity of the strains and 
to determine the full-length sequence of the most prevalent 
genotype in this area.
The Study
We studied 42 HEV strains from patients at Toulouse 
University Hospital, France. None of the patients had trav￾eled abroad during the previous 6 months or reported any 
contact with pigs before the onset of the disease. HEV 
infection was determined by detecting HEV RNA by us￾ing molecular tools (5). We sequenced 2 fragments within 
ORF1, the hypervariable region, and the RNA-dependent 
RNA polymerase (RdRp) genes as previously described 
(6,7). A 348-nt fragment of ORF2 was amplifi ed according 
to the protocol of Inoue et al. (8). The whole genome was 
amplifi ed with 6 overlapping reverse transcription–PCRs. 
The primers are listed in Table 1. The reverse transcription 
conditions were 50°C for 30 min and 85°C for 5 min. The 
PCR cycling conditions were initial denaturation at 94°C 
for 2 min, then 50 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 15 
sec, annealing at 60°C for 30 sec, and elongation at 68°C 
for 3 min.
The phylogenetic tree obtained for the ORF2 region 
showed that all strains belonged to genotype 3 (Figure 1, 
panel A). A total of 37 strains (TLS1–TLS37) segregated 
as a distinct clade among genotype-3 reference sequences, 
whereas 5 other strains (TLS38–TLS42) formed distinct 
branches in the tree. TLS1–TLS37 could be subtyped as 
3f, according to the classifi cation proposed by Lu et al. (3). 
The nucleotide sequences of our local 3f strains and the 
strains from Spain and the Netherlands, which had been 
identifi ed in humans, pigs, and sewage of animal origin, 
had 90.2%–95.3% identity. The 5 remaining strains were 
also genetically related to swine strains. Strains TLS38 and 
TLS42 were more closely related to 3e strains from swine in 
Great Britain (88.5%–92.1% nucleotide sequence identity). 
These strains were also closely related to Japanese strains 
AB248520 and AB248522, which may have a British origin 
(87.5%–93.4% identity) (9). Strains TLS40 and TLS41 were 
located on the same branch as swine HEV isolates identifi ed 
in the Netherlands and classifi ed as subtype 3c. The nucle￾otide sequence of TLS41 had 91.7%–92.7% identity with 
that of strains from pigs in the Netherlands, whereas that 
of TLS40 was only 85.5%–86.1% identical to that of pig 
strains from the Netherlands. Strain TLS39 was similar to 
the 3b strains identifi ed in Japan in human patients or ani￾mals (86.8%–90.1% nucleotide sequence identity).
The topology of the phylogenetic tree obtained for the 
RdRp region was similar to that of ORF2 (Figure 1, panel 
B). All the strains clustered with genotype 3 strains. The 
same 37 strains (TLS1–TLS37) clustered together (87.9%–
99.1% nucleotide sequence identity) and the same 5 strains 
(TLS38–TLS42) appeared to be more divergent.
The hypervariable region gave the same clade of 37 
strains in the phylogenetic tree, whereas the 5 remaining 
strains were more divergent (Figure 2, panel A). Strains 
TLS1–TLS37 exhibited only 70.1%–86.8% nucleotide se￾quence identity in this part of the genome, which shows 
the great diversity of this region. According to the primers 
position (6), a fragment of 345 nt was expected for all the

of the hypervariable region of the genotype 3f strains varied 
from 435 nt for 29 samples, to 412 nt for 3 samples, and to 
348 nt for 5 samples. For the 3e strains, the fragments were 
387 nt and 412 nt. The PCR product from the hypervariable 
region was 345 nt for only the 3c and 3b strains.
The complete genome from TLS25 strain (genotype 
3f) was amplifi ed. The genomic length was 7,321 nt with 
the 3 major ORFs. Comparison with full-length reference 
sequences showed an insertion of ≈90 nt in the hypervari￾able region. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences of HEV

was labeled with the GenBank accession number of the strain, the geographic area, and the host, if nonhuman, and the geographic area

genotype 3 and was genetically distinct from the genotype 
3 strains found in Asia and in the United States (Figure 2, 
panel B). Comparisons with the complete genome sequenc￾es of HEV indicated that strain TLS25 shared 72.0%–72.9% 
nucleotide sequence identity with genotype 1 strains, 72% 
nucleotide sequence identity with genotype 2 strain, and 
73.7%–74.5% nucleotide sequence identity with genotype 
4 strains (Table 2). Strain TLS25 shows 83.1%–84.3% nu￾cleotide sequence identity with HEV genotype 3e, 81.8% 
identity with the HEV strain 3g, 79.7%–80.3% identity 
with HEV genotype 3b, and 79.5%–81.8% identity with 
HEV genotype 3a over the entire genome. No recombina￾tion event was detected within the TLS25 strain by using 
the Recombinant Detection Program (http://darwin.uvigo.
es/rdp/rdp.html). The sequences were deposited in Gen￾Bank under accession nos. EU495106–EU495232.
Conclusions
Most (88%) of the HEV strains in France belonged to 
3f subtype, but 3c, 3e, and 3b strains were also identifi ed. 
Phylogenetic analyses indicated that HEV strains in France 
were related to swine strains previously identifi ed in Eu￾rope. This full-length sequencing of an HEV genotype 3 
strain from Europe showed it to be distinct from the geno￾type 3 strains found on other continents, which illustrates 
the great diversity of this genotype. Due to an insertion in

the hypervariable region, the TLS25 sequence is longer than 
other HEV sequences available in GenBank. A variation in 
the length of the hypervariable region in 1 human strain of 
genotype 3e was previously reported (9). Because the func￾tion of this region of the genome is still unknown, the effect 
of such insertions on virus biology has yet to be elucidated. 
Zhai et al. reported that phylogenetic analyses within the 
RdRp region correlated well with the results from the phy￾logenetic analyses of the complete genome (7), whereas Lu 
et al. found that the ORF2 region was the region that de￾termined most accurately genotypes and subtypes (3). Our 
data indicate that both regions can be used to determine the 
genotype and subtype. The source of autochthonous hepa￾titis E infection in industrialized countries is unknown. One 
hypothesis, supported by molecular epidemiologic studies, 
is that it is an emerging zoonotic infection (10,11). Con￾tamination with HEV may be linked to occupational expo￾sure (12,13), consumption of undercooked meat (14,15), or 
exposure to a contaminated environment.
Our study characterized several human HEV strains 
and sequenced the full-length HEV 3f genome. These 
strains were closely related to European swine strains. Pro-
