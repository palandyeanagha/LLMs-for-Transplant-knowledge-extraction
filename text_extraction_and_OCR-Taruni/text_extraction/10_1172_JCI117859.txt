Anemia is an invariable consequence of end-stage renal fail￾ure (ESRF) and recombinant erythropoietin has dramati￾cally improved the quality of life of patients with ESRF.
As an alternative approach, we developed a myoblast gene
transfer system for the systemic delivery of human erythro￾poietin (EPO). We recently reported that transplantation
of 4 x 107 cells of a C2 myoblast cell clone that stably
secretes high level of functional human EPO, increased he￾matocrit from 44.6±3.0 to 71.2±7.9(%) in 2 wk, and the
increase was sustained for at least 12 wk in nude mice. A
renal failure model was created by a two-step nephrectomy
in nude mice, and myoblasts were transplanted 3 wk af￾ter the second nephrectomy, when mean blood urea nitro￾gen level had increased from 26.3±6.1 to 85.4±24.0 (mg/
dl) and the hematocrit had decreased from 45.2±2.7 to
33.9±3.7(%). After transplantation, the hematocrit mark￾edly increased to 68.6±4.2(%) 2 wk, and to 68.5±4.0(%)
7 wk after the transplantation. Serum human EPO concen￾tration determined by ELISA indicated a persistent steady
EPO production from the transplanted muscle cells 8 wk
after the transplantation. The fate of transplanted myoblasts
in uremic mice was monitored by transplanting the EPO￾secreting clone which had also been transduced with BAG
retrovirus bearing the fi-galactosidase gene. 8 wk later, X￾gal positive myofibers were detected in the entire trans￾planted area. The results demonstrate that myoblasts can
be transplanted in uremic mice, and that myoblast gene
transfer can achieve sufficient and sustained delivery of
functionally active EPO to correct anemia associated with
renal failure in mice. (J. Clin. Invest. 1995. 95:1808-1813.)

Introduction
Anemia is an invariable consequence of end-stage renal failure.
The use of recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO)' has dra￾matically improved the quality of life of patients with end￾stage renal failure (1). However, this therapy requires frequent
hospital visits by patients, limiting patients' life styles as well
as job opportunities. As an alternate therapy, we attempted to
establish a gene therapy protocol to systemically deliver this
cytokine. The prime requirements of gene transfer approaches
for systemic delivery of cytokines in general are: (1) sufficient
and (2) sustained production of (3) the functional transgene
product to achieve (4) a therapeutically significant systemic
response. A successful gene therapy protocol should thus de￾crease frequent hospital visits for recombinant EPO therapy.
Gene therapy protocols for malignant tumors such as mela￾noma (2) and brain tumors (3) by local delivery of target
genes have produced some therapeutic success in clinical trials.
Although a number of gene therapy approaches have been tested
for systemic delivery of cytokines (4, 5), gene therapy for
systemic delivery of hormones and cytokines such as factor
IX for the treatment of hemophilia, has not attained sustained
normalization of the disease condition (for instance, normaliza￾tion of bleeding time) in animal models. We have evaluated a
myoblast gene transfer system to deliver human EPO. My￾oblasts appear to be a highly suitable model for cell-mediated
gene delivery. Myoblasts can be isolated from mammalian mus￾cle tissue and manipulated easily in vitro, can be expanded
through 20-50 doublings and made available in a large numbers
(6, 7). The cells can be transduced or transfected with recombi￾nant genes, and can be injected back into muscles for autologous
or heterologous transplantation (8-10). The unique biology of
muscle cells allows the transplanted myoblasts to terminally
differentiate and become part of myofibers by fusing to each
other or fusing into preexisting myofibers; the transplanted nu￾clei and preexisting host nuclei are both sustained and active
in this fused multinucleated myofibers which now serve as a
stable source of transgene expression for lengthy periods (10-
13). Despite these many attributes of myoblast gene transfer,
there has been no demonstration of long term normalization of
any disease model by the method, and thus, the therapeutic
feasibility of this approach for the systemic delivery of cyto￾kines has yet to be established.
We have recently created C2 muscle cell clones that produce
approximately 0.18 to 32.8 U/ml per 106 cells per day of human
EPO (14). The EPO produced from these muscle cell clones
was functionally active as determined by an in vitro bioassay
using an EPO-dependent cell line. Transplantation of the highest

EPO-producing clone engendered persistent erythropoiesis in
both C3H mice, which are syngeneic with C2 cells, and nude
mice (14). In the nude mice transplanted with this clone, a
marked hematocrit increase lasted for at least 3 mon, while mice
transplanted with parental C2 cells did not show a significant
hematocrit change during the period.
The current major indication for recombinant human EPO
administration is anemia associated with end-stage renal failure
(15). Here, we demonstrate the efficacy of a myoblast gene
therapy approach using an animal model of renal failure in nude
mice. We have tested whether myoblasts can be transplanted
and then secrete functional human EPO in an amount sufficient
to correct anemia for a long term in these uremic mice. Trans￾plantation of EPO-producing C2 cells generated marked eryth￾ropoiesis as efficiently as in non-uremic mice, suggesting that
a myoblast gene transfer approach can be applied in renal failure
mice as effectively as in normal mice. Thus, myoblast gene
transfer may be feasible to correct anemia associated with renal
failure as well as other types of EPO-responsive anemia.
Methods
Materials and animals. 7-8 wk-old male nude mice were used for all
the experiments and purchased from Charles River Labs (Wilmington,
MA). BUN kit (Sigma 535-A) was from Sigma Chemical Co. (St.
Louis, MO). An ELISA system (Quantikine IVD) for EPO concentra￾tion measurement was from R & D systems (Minneapolis, MN). The
animal standard chow (Harlan Tekland ;8656) was from Harlan Tekland
(Madison, WI).
Transfection and screening of clones. Human EPO-secreting C2
myoblast clones were described previously (14). These clones carry
the 1.34-kb human EPO cDNA (starting at + 190 nucleotide from the
major transcription initiation site to the end of poly A tail) (16-18)
cloned into the plasmid pRC/CMV (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). This
plasmid bears the cytomegalovirus enhancer/promoter (19, 20) to drive
the EPO gene, and a neomycin resistance gene (21). The highest EPO￾producing clone, hereafter called C2-EPO9, produces 33 U/ 106 cells
per day of human EPO as determined by radioimmunoassay. The func￾tional activity of EPO produced by this clone was confirmed by an in
vitro bioassay (14).
Myoblast transplantation. Myoblasts from C2-EPO9 were cultured
and harvested as previously described (14). Under general anesthesia,
a total of 4 x 107 cells were injected through a 27-gauge needle at 40
different sites (1 x 106 cells/10 MI per site) of skeletal muscle of
both hind limbs in nude mice. All the experimental procedures were in
accordance with institutional guidelines at the University of Southern
California School of Medicine. Anesthetic agents included 20 mg/kg of
ketamine hydrochloride and 3 mg/kg of xylazine hydrochloride (Sigma
Chemical Co.).
Hematocrit measurement. Hematocrit was measured by the micro￾hematocrit method (22). Each week under general anesthesia, 150 Ml
of blood was collected by a retroorbital approach into two heparinized
capillary tubes. On several occasions, we also measured the hematocrit
using a Coulter Counter which showed results parallel to those obtained
by the microhematocrit method (not shown). After hematocrit measure￾ment, serum was recovered from the capillary tubes and stored at -20°C
for the measurement of EPO concentration and BUN.
Creation of renal failure model using nude mice. A renal failure
model was created by a two-step nephrectomy (23) using 7-8 wk-old
male nude mice. Under general anesthesia using sterile techniques, the
right kidney was exposed through a flank incision and decapsulated,
and the upper and lower poles (two thirds of the right kidney) were
resected. The remnant right kidney was allowed to recover from swelling
for a week, and then the total left kidney was resected. The animals
were fed standard chow containing 24.0% protein and 1.0% phosphorus,
and water ad libitum. Renal failure was confirmed by the development
of both anemia and uremia. For uremia, blood urea nitrogen (BUN)
was determined weekly with a BUN kit using 4 i1 of serum.
Measurement of serum EPO concentration. Serum concentrations
of human EPO were determined by an enzyme linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) system using a mouse monoclonal antibody according
to the manufacturer's protocol. This method has a linear range between
2.5 and 200 mU/ml of human EPO with a detection threshold of 0.25
mU/ml.
/3-galactosidase assays. After euthanasia, skeletal muscle tissue was
excised and frozen immediately on dry ice. The excised muscles were
then sectioned with a freezing microtome. The sections were attached
to microscope slides, fixed in 0.25% glutaraldehyde for 10 min, washed
in PBS for 10 min, and stained in PBS containing 1 mg/ml of X-gal,
5 mM potassium ferricyanide, 5 mM potassium ferrocyanide, and 2 mM
MgCl2. Sections were incubated at 370C degree overnight, rinsed in
PBS, mounted, studied under a microscope, and photographed.
Statistical analysis. Statistical significance was assessed by Stu￾dent's t test. P < 0.05 was taken as significant. Data were expressed
as means±SD.
Results
Creation of renal failure model in mice. The major current
clinical indication for recombinant human EPO protein is ane￾mia in end-stage renal failure (24). We tested whether a myo￾blast gene transfer approach could be effective for the treatment
of anemia in renal failure. We first attempted to create renal
failure models that developed severe anemia allowing us to test
the effect of C2-EPO9 transplantation. A two-step nephrectomy
was performed in 27 male nude mice. Two thirds of the right
kidney was resected first and a week later, the left kidney was
totally resected. Two mice died shortly after the first nephrec￾tomy, and eight after the second, presumably due to acute renal
failure and/or bleeding. This mortality rate is comparable with
a previous report (25). 17 mice that survived the acute phases
of the two-step surgery were further followed weekly for the
development of anemia and uremia, an indication for a success￾ful nephrectomy. Hematocrit and BUN changes in these surviv￾ing mice are shown in Fig. 1. A week after the second nephrec￾tomy, all the mice developed significant anemia (Fig. 1, A and
B). As shown in Fig. 1 A, anemia improved somewhat for the
following week in five mice, possibly due to EPO production
in response to hypoxia from residual renal tissue and liver (Fig.
1 A). Because of this tendency of hematocrit normalization,
these five mice were followed without transplantation (group
I). These group I mice did not develop further anemia (Fig.
1 A). Although BUN increase was obvious after the second
nephrectomy in the group I mice (Fig. 1 B), it remained mod￾erate and was not progressive. In group I, only one mouse
died during the experimental period, consistent with milder
anemia and uremia. In the other 12 mice (group II), ane￾mia was more severe and persistent (Fig. 1 C). The mean
hematocrit decreased from a preoperative level of 45.2±2.7 to
33.9±3.7(%) 3 wk after the second nephrectomy. Since the
hematocrit decrease appears to be relatively stabilized by week
3 in group II mice, these mice appeared to be ideal for testing
the effect of C2-EPO9 transplantation. We decided to use some
group II mice to study the efficacy of the transplantation. Eight
mice were transplanted with C2-EPO9 cells (Fig. 1 C, solid
lines), and three mice were followed without transplantation as
control (Fig. 1 C, dashed lines) (one mouse died just before
transplantation presumably due to severe uremia). All of the
transplanted mice of group H had a marked hematocrit increase

(Fig. 1 C), despite the presence of severe uremia as indicated
by the progressively increasing BUN levels (Fig. 1 D). A mean
hematocrit of 68.6±4.2% was achieved 2 wk after the trans￾plantation, and this hematocrit increase persisted thereafter.
Those without transplantation showed persistent or even deteri￾orating anemia (Fig. 1 C, dashed lines). BUN increase was
much more striking (95.4±16.5 mg/dl) in group II (Fig. 1 D)
than in group 1 (52.6±13.2 mg/dl three weeks after the second
nephrectomy) (Fig. 1 B). All of the group II mice, except
one, died between 6 and 11 wk (8.2± 1.8 wk) after the second
nephrectomy presumably due to severe uremia. The observed
survival rate is consistent with previous observations (26). The
one long term survivor in group II also had the lowest levels
of BUN in that group (Figs. 1, C and D, closed circles). These
data clearly demonstrate the feasibility and potential efficacy of
a myoblast gene transfer system even in the face of severe renal
failure in mice.
Serum EPO level. To examine the secretion of EPO protein
from the transplanted cells, we measured serum human EPO
concentration using an ELISA. We previously determined that
this method did not detect a significant level of mouse EPO
(< 2.5 mU/ml) in sera of nude mice phlebotomized (150 il)
weekly over 3 mo (unpublished observation). This observation
was confirmed in the non-transplanted renal failure mice in
group II (not shown). Thus, serum EPO measured by this
method represents just the human EPO produced by the trans￾planted muscle cells and not endogenous EPO levels. A week
after transplantation with C2-EPO9 cells, the serum EPO level

determined by ELISA. Sera from control mice (Fig. I C, dashed lines)

was 87.3±22.1 mU/ml in group H uremic mice (Fig. 2). It
declined to 53.8±18.7 mU/m at week 2, and a similar concen￾tration was maintained thereafter until week 8. Thus, the trans￾planted C2-EPO9 cells persistently produced human EPO at a
steady rate for at least 2 mo after transplantation into mice with
severe renal failure.
The fate of transplanted EPO-secreting myoblasts in renal
failure model. To analyze the fate of transplanted myoblasts,
C2-EPO9 cells were transduced with BAG retrovirus (27) bear￾ing P-galactosidase and neomycin resistence genes. Since the
C2-EPO9 clone had already been maintained in the presence
of G418, BAG-transduced clones were selected by positive X￾gal staining. Cells from one X-gal positive clone (clone 9-
BAG) were expanded and transplanted into nude mice with
renal failure according to the same protocol used for C2-EPO
transplantation. These mice also showed a marked hematocrit
increase from pre-transplantation level of 36.2±4.6% to
60.8±5.6% 4 wk after the transplantation. Six weeks later, X￾gal positive myofibers were detected in the entire area of trans￾plantation. At some sites, most of the myofibers were X-gal
positive (Fig. 3, A and B), while at other sites, both X-gal
positive and negative myofibers coexisted (Fig. 3, C and D).
However, we have been unable to detect X-gal positive my￾oblasts. These results demonstrated that the transplanted EPO￾secreting myoblasts differentiated by fusing with preexisting
host myofibers or themselves and that the transgenes were ac￾tively expressed from the transplanted cells for the duration of
the experimental protocol.
Discussion
Human EPO protein has a 79% amino acid homology with
mouse EPO, and its administration induces marked erythropoie￾sis in mice as well as other species of animals including rat and
dog (28, 29). To avoid immunological consequences engen￾dered by human EPO produced in a different species, we used
nude mice and attempted to determine the feasibility of a myo￾blast gene transfer approach in the treatment of renal failure.
This gene therapy approach successfully met the prime require￾ments of (1) sufficient and (2) sustained secretion of (3) func￾tional EPO transgene products, resulting in (4) a correction
of anemia associated with renal failure (therapeutic systemic
response), and thus demonstrated the potential therapeutic value
of the approach.
We previously found that the transplantation of C2-EPO9
cells sustained a hematocrit increase for at least 3 mo in normal
nude mice ( 14). Following this successful result, we attempted
to correct anemia associated with renal failure, a major current
indication for recombinant EPO therapy (15, 24). A number
of clinical features of the uremic syndrome might be expected
to adversely effect the outcome of a myoblast gene transfer
approach for systemic EPO delivery. Wound repair processes
after myoblast transplantation, for instance, could be much less
efficient in uremic animals compared with normal animals due
to poor nutrition, hemorrhagic diathesis, and infection (30).
Myoblast gene transfer might be further hampered by uremic
myopathy as well as polymyositis syndromes observed in
chronic renal failure (30). It is unknown how other abnormalit￾ies in the uremic syndrome including electrolyte disorders,
metabolic acidosis (i.e., glucose intolerance), gastrointestinal
disorders, neurologic abnormalities, and metabolic disorders,
might affect the outcome of myoblast transplantation. Further￾more, the erythroid response to EPO is significantly reduced,
and red blood cell survival is shortened in uremia (30).
To our surprise, however, C2-EPO9 transplantation could,
even in the face of severe uremia, deliver more than a sufficient
amount of human EPO to correct anemia in nude mice with
renal failure. The transplantation of 4 x 107 cells from C2-
EPO9 increased hematocrit by 35% in renal failure mice (Fig.
1 C), which is comparable with 27%, the degree of hematocrit
increase observed in non-uremic mice ( 14). Although the thera￾peutic effects lasted for at least 2 mo, longer periods of analysis
were limited by animal death probably due to severe renal fail￾ure. However, with treatment of renal failure, it is likely that
the hematocrit increase would persist for more than 2 mo, as
was the case with non-uremic mice (14). The observation that
the serum EPO concentration was still high at 2 mo, together
with the fact that the half-life of red blood cells in mice is
20-45 d (31), also supports the likelihood that the increased
hematocrit would have been sustained longer than 2 mo, if the
uremia had been corrected by dialysis. The sustained high serum
human EPO concentration due to C2-EPO9 transplantation con￾firmed that the observed hematocrit increase was due to human
EPO derived from the transplanted cells rather than endogenous
mouse EPO. The persistent presence of X-gal positive myofibers
after clone 9-BAG transplantation further supports the notion
that the transplanted myoblasts differentiate into myofibers and
become a stable source of EPO production in the face of renal
failure.
We have frequently observed tumor formation in the trans￾planted nude mice after 2-3 mo. However, these tumor cells
are not likely to contribute to the observed hematocrit increase,
since the cultured tumor cells recovered from the tumor of one
mouse did not secrete any detectable amount of human EPO
by ELISA (not shown). Furthermore, the serum EPO concen￾Myoblast Gene Therapy for Anemia in Renal Failure 1811

tration remains relatively constant despite growing tumor size.
Thus, it seems that myofibers derived from C2-EPO9 cells are
responsible for the persistent hematocrit increase.
End-stage renal failure'patients as well as patients with hy￾poproliferative anemia secondary to 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymi￾dine (AZT) administration are currently treated with 100-150
U of recombinant EPO per kg of body weight per week to
maintain a target hematocrit level between 30 and 33 (14, 15),
which is equal to 857-1286 U/day for a 60-kg patient. Since
C2-EPO9 secretes 32.8 U of EPO/ 106 cells per day, 3.9 x 107
cells would, in theory, be sufficient to provide 1286 U/day.
The delivery of this number of muscle cells appears to be feasi￾ble, since in a phase I clinical trial of myoblast transfer in
Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients, as many as 108 myo￾blasts could be prepared from small muscle biopsy (0.5-1.0
grams) of first degree relatives and transplanted into patients
(32). However, a more accurate calculation would be needed
for human application of the technique, based on the informa￾tion regarding the nature of erythroid response to exogenously
provided human EPO as well as efficiency of myoblast trans￾plantation.
The present myoblast gene transfer system would be opti￾mized for possible clinical applications. To this end, we have
begun experiments to explore two different approaches: (a) the
use of primary myoblasts and (b) the use of an implantable
immunoisolation device. Although primary myoblasts trans￾fected with EPO cDNA can secrete EPO and increase hemato￾crit in mice (33), this approach'would require customized prep￾aration of cells for an individual patient to avoid immunorejec￾tion. In this regard, a stocked cell line with an immunoisolation
device might be a more practical approach for a large population
of patients. Within such a device transformed myoblasts appear
to retain an ability to differentiate (34) and are likely to become
a stable source of recombinant protein production.
Although mice appear to tolerate the unusually high hemato￾crit for several months (35), overproduction of EPO could have
potentially deleterious consequences including polycythemia
(36, 37). Although we and others have found that recombinant
gene production can be controlled to some degree by the number
of cells transplanted (unpublished observation) ( 10), regulated
transgene expression could also be achieved, for example, by
use of inducible promoters to drive genes of interest (38, 39).
The major point of the present study was the demonstration
(a) that myoblast gene transfer technology could correct a dis￾ease condition (correction of anemia) as a systemic response
to EPO transgene expression, and (b) that myoblast gene trans￾fer is feasible for delivery of genes of interest (not restricted
to EPO) in the setting of severe uremia, a disease condition
previously untested for this approach. The result opens the pos￾sibility of delivering EPO, as well as other genes, to treat disease
conditions in renal failure patients by myoblast gene transfer.
This system may eventually offer an alternate, possibly more
efficient gene therapy approach for the treatment of anemia
associated with renal failure as well as other EPO-responsive
anemias which must otherwise be treated with life-long repeated
administrations of recombinant EPO protein.
