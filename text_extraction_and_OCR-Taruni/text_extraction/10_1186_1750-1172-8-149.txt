Augmentation therapy for alpha-1 antitrypsin
deficiency: towards a personalised approach

Abstract
Background: Intravenous augmentation therapy is the only specific treatment available for emphysema associated
with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Despite large observational studies and limited interventional studies there
remains controversy about the efficacy of this treatment due to the impracticality of conducting adequately
powered studies to evaluate the rate of decline in lung function, due to the low prevalence and the slow
progression of the disease. However, measurement of lung density by computed tomography is a more specific
and sensitive marker of the evolution of emphysema and two small placebo-controlled clinical trials have provided
evidence supporting a reduction in the rate of decline in lung density with augmentation therapy.
The problem: Where augmentation therapy has become available there has been little consideration of a
structured approach to therapy which is often introduced on the basis of functional impairment at diagnosis. Data
from registries have shown a great variability in the evolution of lung disease according to patient acquisition and
the presence of recognised risk factors. Avoidance of risk factors may, in many cases, stabilise the disease. Since
augmentation therapy itself will at best preserve the presenting level of lung damage yet require intravenous
administration for life with associated costs, identification of patients at risk of continued rapid or long term
progression is essential to select those for whom this treatment can be most appropriate and hence generally
more cost-effective. This represents a major reconsideration of the current practice in order to develop a consistent
approach to management world wide.
Purpose of this review: The current review assesses the evidence for efficacy of augmentation therapy and
considers how the combination of age, physiological impairment, exacerbation history and rate of decline in
spirometry and other measures of emphysema may be used to improve therapeutic decision making, until a
reliable predictive biomarker of the evolution of lung impairment can be identified. In addition, individual
pharmacokinetic studies may permit the selection of the best regimen of administration for those who need it.
Summary: The rarity and variable characteristics of the disease imply the need for an individualised approach to therapy
in specialised centres with sufficient experience to apply a systematic approach to monitoring and management.

Introduction
Our understanding of the pathophysiology of COPD, but
in particular emphysema was largely instigated by the
observation that α1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) was
associated with the early onset of basal panlobular em￾physema [1]. Since AAT became characterised as an in￾hibitor of serine proteinases, data eventually showed that
neutrophil elastase (NE) could produce emphysema like
lesions in animal models [2]. Indeed subsequently this
enzyme has been shown to produce many of the patho￾logical features of COPD [3]. The logical conclusion from
such studies was that augmentation of AAT in deficient
subjects would restore the protection of the lung from NE
and hence slow the aggressive form of emphysema seen in
deficient subjects.
Because of the “rarity” of AATD it was deemed that
classical clinical trials using spirometry as an outcome
could not be undertaken [4] but the logical argument for
efficacy, based on an understanding of the biochemistry

prevailed. For these reasons augmentation therapy for
AATD subjects became accepted and funded in many
countries whilst others (unrealistically) called for con￾ventional placebo controlled clinical trials to establish
efficacy beyond doubt. However the high cost of such
therapy means that efficacy is now being increasingly
questioned even where therapy has been available and
indeed some countries have withdrawn the use of augmen￾tation whilst others continue to withhold therapy.
So what is the data?
There is no doubt that augmentation therapy given intra￾venously increases the nadir antigenic AAT level to one
that is consistent with the lower level for the heterozygote
(MZ pheno/genotype) that carries no or, at least, very little
risk to developing significant COPD [5], and above that
for the SZ heterozygote where controversy still continues
about whether such subjects are or are not at increased
risk. Biochemical studies confirmed that at least some of
the infused AAT remained active when retrieved from the
lung by bronchoalveolar lavage [6] implying that it was
also active in the lung tissues where the emphysema
damage is thought to take place. A somewhat missed
opportunity to verify the protective effect of augmentation
therapy is the lack of definitive evidence that biomarkers
of connective tissue degradation thought to be central to
the development of emphysema, such as desmosines in
plasma or more specific peptides derived from the
microenviromental activity of neutrophil elastase, decline
after initiation of intravenous augmentation therapy. New
recent attempts to use these markers [7,8] could strengthen
a personalised approach to treatment by ensuring markers
of tissue damage are normal or become normal on therapy.
However, it should be pointed out that biochemical efficacy
based on AAT levels is not necessarily the same as clinical
protection. The classical endpoint for clinical trials in
COPD has long been the FEV1 and early calculations
indicated that no study of augmentation could be powered
for such an outcome due to the rarity of the disease [4].
For this reason observational studies were undertaken
and these indirect data were used to support efficacy.
For instance, the NIH registry [9] suggested that individuals
who received therapy for at least 6 months had not just a
reduction in mortality but also a modulation of the FEV1
decline for those with baseline values in the range 35-60%
predicted. However, these data were likely influenced, at
least in part, by availability of healthcare provision and so￾cial aspects of healthcare delivery in the USA. Nevertheless,
other studies provided similar results by observing a greater
decline in FEV1 in countries where augmentation was
not available [10] and a reduction in decline after therapy
was instigated [11]. Furthermore the former observation
was also supported by a recent meta-analysis providing
indirect evidence that spirometric decline is less where
augmentation is available [12]. Nevertheless it is recognised
that these observations, though supportive, cannot replace
formal clinical trials. Importantly the NIH study, where
used to support augmentation, has been interpreted as
suggesting no benefit outside the FEV1 limits of 35-60%
predicted and in some countries augmentation is stopped
below this lower limit and not usually started above these
limits. However recent data has indicated that using
other more specific and sensitive measures of emphysema,
such as the alveolar gas transfer and/or the decrease in
lung density, indicate that progression of lung disease
occurs both above and below these FEV1 limits [13,14],
even when FEV1 remains stable as indicated in data
summarised in Figure 1 for an individual patient from
the UK National Registry.
A recent Cochrane review took the pragmatic approach
of analysing the efficacy of augmentation therapy based on
the results of decline in FEV1 of the only 2 small placebo
controlled trials available [15,16] and concluded that there
was no convincing data to support the efficacy of augmen￾tation therapy [17]. However, both studies were just short
of conventional statistical significance in favour of the
efficacy of augmentation therapy using lung densitometry
as the outcome. Combining the 2 studies and excluding all
individuals who participated in the first (less robust study)
from the second (more robust study) was however highly
suggestive of efficacy in reducing the rate of decline in lung
density [18], which is validated and has become accepted
as the most specific and sensitive measurement of the
progression of emphysema [13,19,20]. In addition even
the second study alone [16] was significant if analysis
was confined to the lower zone where the panacinar
emphysema of AATD predominates [21].
This disparity between a demonstrable effect on densi￾tometry and a lack of effect on FEV1 is far from surprising.
Not only were these studies based on assessing lung
density, the most sensitive parameter to assess and monitor
emphysema, but were not designed or powered to assess
spirometric outcome. This raises a concern over the ori￾ginal NIH observation that did indicate a positive effect
on FEV1 decline but only in a limited FEV1 range [9].
Recent understanding of the complexity of usual COPD,
as well as of the lung disease associated with AATD has in￾dicated the range of different pathological and clinical phe￾notypes [22]. Effective therapies can only be demonstrated
easily if the generic COPD population is enriched for those
with amplified evidence of the presence and progression of
the proposed outcome measure. Since the FEV1 progresses
most rapidly in the 35-60% predicted range [14] it would
be the most sensitive range to detect a treatment effect
with FEV1 as the outcome. In contrast, FEV1 decline is
modest in severe disease, unlike the lung transfer coeffi￾cient for carbon monoxide (Kco) decline, which is greatest
in severe disease [14]. Therefore, it is essential, especially

with expensive therapy, to identify the patients particularly
at risk and hence most likely to benefit from treatment by
using outcomes specific to the disease process and to
monitor efficacy where these are changing most. In the
case of AATD, emphysema and not airflow obstruction is
the primary pathophysiologic alteration, and it would be
those with evidence of significant and progressing emphy￾sema who should be selected for future efficacy trials. The
assessment of emphysema should also be assessed by the
most specific and sensitive test/s, in this case lung densi￾tometry and alveolar gas transfer.
Management paradigm
Patients with AATD can present with varying degrees of
respiratory disease that is influenced by the awareness of
the medical practitioner to the condition as well as the
severity of symptoms by the time medical help is sought,
together with a suggestive family history. Often there
is a long lapse before AATD is diagnosed [23,24] and,
especially in younger subjects, the symptoms may often be
attributed to a more likely diagnosis of asthma. Patients
may be identified as the index case presenting with
symptoms or as non index, identified by family screening.
The index group usually consists mainly of smokers
especially if they are young and have the classical basal
panlobular emphysema or if older and a non-smoker
(ie no recognised risk factors) with fixed airflow ob￾struction. The non-index subjects identified through
family screening usually have better lung function and
includes both smokers and never smokers but still with a
wide range of physiological impairment [25]. Interestingly
these non-index patients may have complete discordance
in their FEV1 with their index siblings but more con￾cordance with gas transfer and lung densitometry [26].
This disparity provides further strong support for these
latter measurements being more specific to AATD. A
final smaller cohort can be identified due to perinatal
jaundice, a recognised presenting feature of AATD [27]
providing an opportunity for long term monitoring and
earlier detection of deteriorating lung function.
This wide range of presenting age and features provides
the managing physician with a challenge in determining the
best care, monitoring and, importantly, deciding whether
or when to introduce augmentation therapy. Such therapy
cannot be expected to improve already damaged lungs and
leads to the strategy of either preventing the development
of lung pathology or stabilising that already present.
Currently augmentation is aimed at the latter approach
of stabilising the established lung disease and thereby
preventing future progression. It is recognised that at
presentation with established disease, especially at a young
age, the preceding period of the patients life must have
been characterised by a decline in lung function that was
in excess of the normal aging process. The first step in
management however must be to stop smoking or endorse
recent cessation, if that is the status. Usual management

for COPD, such as bronchodilators, are prescribed or
continued in order to maximise airflow physiology and/or
reduce exacerbation frequency as in usual COPD. Indeed
reversibility and exacerbations have been recognised as
factors that influence spirometric [14,19] and gas transfer
[19] decline in AATD and although few clinical trial data
are available of the usual symptomatic and preventative
therapies, they seem to be effective in AATD [28]. A sum￾mary of factors that have been associated with decline in
FEV1 in patients with AATD is presented in Table 1.
Where available, augmentation is usually prescribed
especially if the FEV1 is in range of 35-60% predicted
(as suggested by the observational NIH study), where
spirometric benefit has best been demonstrated. However,
despite the preceding decline in spirometry being obviously
excessive prior to diagnosis, after the cessation of smoking
and introduction of usual therapy for COPD there is no
certainty that disease progression will continue, particularly
in patients with no other recognised risk factors for
progression (e.g. professional exposure to dusts and fumes,
bronchial hyperresponsiveness, frequent exacerbations, etc.)
[14,19,32,36-39]. Measurement of lung physiology is
complex and single measures are subject to patient effort
(even for simple spirometry) and day to day variability.
For these reasons a period of monitoring for subjects with
FEV1 between 80 and 60% of predicted at detection of the
deficiency should be undertaken from diagnosis over at
least 2–3 years assessing all aspects of physiological health
status, not only FEV1, to determine stability or instability
before the decision about augmentation therapy is taken.
Nevertheless, it is recognised that such a delay may be less
appropriate in some patients with more severe impairment
(FEV1 and/or KCO < 60%, values at which most subjects
report respiratory symptoms) as preservation of lung
function becomes more critical at advanced stages.
Decisions for augmentation treatment need to be made at
this point on a risk/benefit basis, as the lung destruction in
emphysema is irreversible and the next future option is
transplantation or the continued increased morbidity,
health care utilisation and death of unabated progression.
Factors such as age, health status, activity and need and
ability to continue current life style will all influence this
decision making and, in some, further observation of
decline after smoking cessation and optimisation of
other therapies may still be possible or even essential.
The development and validation of specific biomarkers that
could predict future progression will become essential
if such a period of observation is to be avoided.
Management of non-smokers and the more elderly pa￾tients becomes easier in decision making as the interaction
with cigarette smoking (and hence the benefits of cessation)
will not complicate assessment of the preceding natural
history or will have indicated a much slower course
[40,41]. Thus current age, morbidity and physiology are
key factors that will provide information on overall rate
of progression of lung disease since the attainment of
maximal lung function in the teens. With this information
an estimate of the likely subsequent rate of progression
and future morbidity and hence any benefit of stabilisation
with augmentation therapy can be made with more confi￾dence. Although it is recognised that in never smoking non
index cases, life expectancy is essentially normal [42,43]
it is not necessarily without significant morbidity. As an
example, a predictive model for FEV1 and the presence
of severe COPD developed with data from 372 individuals
with AATD phenotype PiZZ has identified age, sex, pack￾years of smoking, bronchodilator responsiveness, chronic
bronchitis symptoms and index case status as significantly
associated factors. The model explained 50% of the variance
in FEV1 and showed an excellent discrimination for severe
COPD [30]. These findings suggest that the classical criteria
for augmentation therapy based only on diagnosis of the
deficiency and the presence of emphysema/reduced FEV1
without any consideration of risks of poor future evolution,
must be improved.
The subjects identified in childhood through neonatal
or family screening present a unique challenge. Currently
there is no evidence to suggest all such subjects will
develop COPD/emphysema. Indeed the data suggest that
such a cohort has reasonably normal physiology in their
30s [44]. However normal physiology does not mean no
problem as the normal range for lung physiology is wide
and individual subjects can undergo significant physio￾logical decline whilst lung function is still within the nor￾mal range. Indeed recent data suggest that changes within
the normal range can be detected as early as in the mid to
late 20s in such subjects even if never smokers [45]. Thus
if augmentation therapy is to be used in a preventative
strategy it would be appropriate to consider earlier inter￾vention in such subjects before significant disease and
morbidity occurs. For these reasons it seems appropriate

to obtain a baseline assessment of lung health in the mid
to late teens and then monitor any deterioration on a fre￾quent basis (perhaps every 2–3 years) so that deterioration
within the normal range can be determined early. Providing
no risk factors can be implicated, summary statistics using
3–4 data points will provide data likely to predict future
progression. The time at which augmentation is introduced
will require a cost/benefit appraisal although an argument
could be made to wait at least until the development of
mild symptoms or physiological deterioration below
the normal range. Whichever approach is used, data on
previous rate of decline will provide some evidence of
efficacy determined by observation of the subsequent
rate of decline of lung function.
Should frequent exacerbations influence decision making?
Exacerbations of COPD have become widely recognised
as episodes that can lead to a decline in spirometry,
impairment in health status and increased risk of death
[46]. Exacerbations caused by bacteria are neutrophilic
and although largely confined to the airways, are associated
with easily detectable excessive (or increased) NE activity
[47]. The inflammation and amount of detectable NE is
even greater in subjects with AATD [48] suggesting that
NE generated progression is more likely in such patients
and indeed there is a similar effect of exacerbations on
spirometric decline as seen in usual COPD; furthermore,
exacerbations are also associated with a decline in the gas
transfer of the lung for carbon monoxide over time in
patients with AATD [19,32]. Early retrospective analysis
suggested that augmentation therapy reduced the number
of exacerbations [49] although the increase in health care
contact due to the regular infusions could have influenced
this result. In the EXACTLE trial exacerbation frequency
was not reduced, although there was a reduction in severe
episodes requiring hospitalisation [16]. This observation is
consistent with the increased inflammation associated
with exacerbations in AATD and the ability of augmenta￾tion to reduce lung inflammation [50] thereby reducing
the clinical severity of the episodes.
The inflammatory burden associated with severe exacer￾bations may still accelerate the lung damage in patients
with AATD, as illustrated in a published case study where,
after a period of stabilisation of lung function with aug￾mentation therapy, FEV1 decline accelerated after a series
of admissions for exacerbations despite the continuation of
the augmentation therapy [51] (Figure 2). This observation
suggests that in some patients and/or in some situations
the current dosage based on the stable state nadir plasma
levels of heterozygotes or the route of administration may
be insufficient to prevent lung deterioration [52] and
perhaps bolus or inhaled therapy at the start of an exacer￾bation might prove effective [53]. Clearly further studies are
needed to determine the validity of this approach.
Hospital admissions are expensive and associated with
increased mortality in COPD [54,55]. Thus such AATD
patients (despite usual COPD preventative therapy) may
represent a more immediately cost effective group requiring
augmentation therapy and frequency of admissions pre and
post therapy can be monitored to indicate probable benefit

severe pulmonary infections requiring hospitalisation increased from 1989 and were accompanied by a rapid decrease in FEV1. Published from

or lack of benefit. However it may be that local administra￾tion of AAT by the inhaled route will prove most effective
in frequent exacerbations as these are airway dominant epi￾sodes and not alveolar/interstitial processes, that may be
beyond the reach of conventional nebulisers [56]. Results of
the current ongoing trial in such patients may help resolve
this issue [57].
Different series have demonstrated a prevalence of
bronchiectasis of around 25% to 50% in patients with
AATD [58,59]. The relationship between AATD and
bronchiectasis is not fully elucidated. Although some
studies suggest that patients with AATD are more at risk of
developing bronchiectasis, large series of bronchiectasis pa￾tients have failed to demonstrate an increase of cases with
AATD [60]. Moreover, the prevalence of bronchiectasis in
patients with airflow obstruction is similar to that seen in
usual COPD [61,62]. The presence of bronchiectasis is
associated with increased risk of bronchial colonisation and
hence airway inflammation, and more frequent and severe
exacerbations in usual COPD [62,63]. Therefore, it is likely
that AATD patients with infective complications such as
frequent exacerbations, bronchiectasis, pneumonia or even
chronic bronchitis may represent a subgroup with particular
need for acute or long term augmentation therapy [29,33]
as illustrated in the case 3 although perhaps again the
airway route of administration may be more relevant.
From the criteria for augmentation therapy to a
personalised approach to treatment
Soon after the approval of augmentation therapy by the
Food and Drug Administration, the scientific societies
produced the first guidelines for augmentation, that in￾cluded the classical criteria for treatment comprising,
among others, the demonstration of airflow obstruction, a
severe AAT deficiency (usually PI*ZZ or null genotypes),
and abstinence of smoking [64]. Evidence has accumulated
over several decades and summarised above to indicate that
this approach may not be appropriate for all patients with
the deficiency. The intravenous route of administration, the
high cost of treatment and the differences in natural course
and prognosis among patients, force us to be as precise as
possible in recommending augmentation. This supports the
idea of a personalised approach to treatment in reference
centres with experts who can take into account all the
characteristics of each individual with the deficiency and
evaluate the future risks and eventually make the decision
to initiate augmentation therapy based on a personalised
evaluation of risks, benefits and costs.
The adequacy of treatment can be represented by a
continuous line from one end in which augmentation
therapy would not be recommended, to the opposite
end where all patients fulfilling those characteristics
would be recommended to start augmentation therapy
(summarised in proposed quartiles in Table 2). Each in￾dividual patient should be placed at a given point be￾tween these two opposite ends, which would indicate the
strength of the recommendation for therapy (Figure 3).

The threshold for recommendation of augmentation
therapy could be established at a given point between
both ends, always recommended or never recommended,
based on the existing evidence of benefits of therapy,
baseline presenting demographics, future known or
projected prognosis and evaluation of costs [65]. At present
decision making is largely instigated on a cross sectional
basis. Ideally decision making should be with a clear
understanding of the future predicted progression and
that requires a period of observation once smoking
cessation has been confirmed, all other known factors
avoided and optimal COPD therapy instigated. Slow and
fast decline based on expected changes with age can be
used to place the subjects between the 2 ends of the
treatment spectrum. Continued observation may enable
the patient to be moved within the spectrum and this
depends on a clearer understanding of the natural history
both before and after diagnosis. Clearly urgent research is
needed to clarify this approach in the few remaining co￾horts where therapy has not been instigated or made avail￾able. It may be possible to develop a more objective scoring
system based on a weighted score of the key factors of age,
current severity and preceding rate of decline coupled with
health economic data and examination of such an approach
is urgently required to obtain international agreement and
the development of firm guidelines.
It remains important to state that this article is predom￾inantly based on data and concepts applicable to the PiZZ
and PiZnull genotypes of AATD. The PiSZ genotype has
higher levels of serum AAT but lower than for the hetero￾zygote MZ genotype. Few studies of the natural history of
SZ patients or clinical trials data are available for such
patients. Although some clinicians treat SZ patients in
the same way as the more severely deficient ZZ and
Znull subjects the SZ patients have a milder degree of
impairment compared to matched PiZZ subjects and a
more apical distribution of emphysema similar to usual
COPD [66]. There is little clinical or theoretical data to
support augmentation of SZ patients at present and further
studies are urgently indicated.
Once therapy is indicated, the next step should be the
adjustment of the right dose and interval of administra￾tion for each individual patient. Pharmacokinetic models
will help individualise the regimen in order to provide
adequate trough serum concentrations with the lowest
cost [67]. However it should be noted that such a deci￾sion may need to take into account both the antigenic
and importantly the functional quantity of AAT as the
latter is the most relevant for lung protection.
