Abstract
Hypertension and related cardiovascular diseases are the leading causes of death
in many countries. The etiology of human essential hypertension is largely
unknown. It is highly likely that hypertension is a complex and multifactorial
disease resulting from the interaction of multiple genetic and environmental factors.
Animal models of hypertension have been proved to be useful to study the patho￾genesis of, and to find a new therapy for, hypertension. The aim of this article is
to briefly review the most widely used rodent models of experimental hypertension,
including history and recent advances. These models are classified as geneti￾cally-induced, environmentally-induced, pharmacologically-induced, and renal￾induced hypertension according to the way of induction; the typical representa￾tives of each of these major types of experimental hypertension are spontaneous
hypertension, cold-induced hypertension, DOCA-salt-induced hypertension, and
renal-induced hypertension, respectively. The processes of induction of hyper￾tension, possible pathogenesis, characteristics, advantages, and limitations of
these animal models are reviewed. In addition, the clinical implications of the
above experimental models of hypertension are addressed.

Introduction
Hypertension is the prevalent cause of cardiovascular
disease that leads to heart failure, stroke, renal failure, and,
ultimately, to death. In the USA, approximately 50 million
people have hypertension, according to Phase I estimates of
the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III
(NHANES III), from 1988 to 1991[1]. The prevalence is about
20%. According to a report[2], about 40% of white people
and more than 50% of black people aged 65 or older suffer
from some form of high blood pressure in the USA. Epide￾miological surveys have demonstrated an increasing preva￾lence of hypertension in China, from 5.11% in 1958 to 7.73%
in 1980 and 11.89% in 1991[3,4]. Although this incidence is
lower than that in many developed countries such as the
USA (20%)[1] and Canada[5], it represents 50 million people in
1980 and 90 million people in 1991 due to the size of the
Chinese population. According to relevant reports[4,6], car￾diovascular diseases are the leading causes of death in Chi￾nese society.
The syndrome of hypertension is more than just an el￾evation of arterial pressure, although it is this aspect that the
general public is most familiar with. Hypertension when fully
developed is characterized by an increase in vascular resis￾tance to blood flow, cardiac hypertrophy, often an increase
in cardiac output, an increased output of sympathetic ner￾vous system (SNS), changes within the vascular smooth
muscles, often atherosclerosis, and abnormalities in renal
function. Increased vascular resistance is due to constric￾tion of the vascular smooth muscle, primarily in the high
resistance vessels. The etiology of essential hypertension
is not known and the causes of it may be multifactorial. It is
generally believed that both genetic and environmental fac￾tors and their interactions play a critical role in the patho￾genesis of hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases.
Since hypertension and associated cardiovascular diseases
are the leading causes of death of human beings, medical
scientists are dedicated to elucidate the mechanism of and

stock by Dahl on the basis of developing hypertension with
high NaCl diet. When fed with normal salt diets, these rats
become hypertensive, indicating that this is a genetic model
of hypertension with the feature of salt sensitivity. O’Dowd
and Rapp[8] have refined the genetic background of the origi￾nal Dahl stock, and their salt-sensitive/Jr line is now pre￾ferred (along with their salt-resistant/Jr controls). Genetic
analysis revealed linkage with loci close to the angiotensin
converting enzyme (ACE) and guanylyl cyclase A (GCA)/
atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) receptor genes in Dahl salt￾sensitive rats[9]. It was found that certain alleles at the GCA
and ACE loci (or at loci closely linked to them) had a signifi￾cant impact on blood pressure response to high salt in Dahl
salt-sensitive rats.
The SHR was generated by inbreeding Wistar rats with
the highest blood pressure[7]. The SHR develop many fea￾tures of hypertensive end-organ damages including cardiac
hypertrophy, heart failure, and renal dysfunction. Accord￾ing to relevant reports[11,12], the SHR is the most commonly
used genetic model although the mechanisms for producing
the hypertension are not clear. Overactivity of the brain re￾nin-angiotensin system (RAS) appears to be involved in ini￾tiating the development of spontaneous hypertension based
on the finding that central injections of angiotensin II (AngII)
receptor antagonists cause greater reductions in systolic blood
pressure in SHR than in normotensives[13,14]. However,
DePasquale and colleagues[15] reported that central adminis￾tration of AT1 receptor blocker losartan (DuP 537) did not
lower blood pressure in SHR. Thus, the above hypothesis
needs further confirmation. Interestingly, some hemody￾namic alterations which occur during the development of
the disease are similar to human essential hypertension (ie,
a high cardiac output early, and in the adult, a normal cardiac
output and an increased vascular resistance)[16]. In this
model, there is also an increase in the activity of the sympa￾thetic nervous system as evidenced by increased renal sym￾pathetic activity[16]. The renal blood flow and glomerular
filtration rate are normal[17] and renal vascular resistance is
increased[22]. The SHR stroke prone (SHR-SP) is a further
developed sub-strain with even higher levels of blood pres￾sure and a strong tendency to die from stroke[18]. The SHR
has been used to evaluate genetic factors involved in
hypertension. Although a wide variety of genes seems to
cosegregate in various crosses[12], neither of these genes is
confirmed to be the etiological gene for hypertension. The
advantage of this model is that its pathophysiological
changes are similar to those found in human essential hy￾pertension[16,19]. A major drawback of this model is the lack
of an appropriate control, which has been genetically altered
explore the treatment for hypertension.
It is noticed that animal models of human disease have
been widely used to study etiology and pathogenesis of
human disease, to prevent disease or to find a therapy and
identify risk factors contributing to the disease. This litera￾ture reviews briefly advances in the most widely used ro￾dent models of hypertension, including advantages and
limitations. Hopefully, this will be useful to those in choos￾ing appropriate animal models of hypertension for their
researches. This comprehensive review may help physicians
and scientists understand the pathogenesis of hyperten￾sion and therefore optimize therapeutic approaches. It is our
expectation that the creation and utilization of novel animal
models of hypertension will fundamentally advance the fields
of cardiovascular medicine and physiology.
The major animal models of hypertension
Basically, animal models of hypertension comprise pri￾mary and secondary hypertension according to hyperten￾sion etiology (Figure 1). The primary hypertension includes
genetically-induced and environmentally-induced hyperten￾sion and the secondary hypertension includes pharmaco￾logically-induced and renal-induced hypertension by the way
of induction.
Genetically-induced hypertension Animals that have
undergone artificial genetic manipulation are predestined to
become hypertensive. Some investigators believe that ge￾netically hypertensive rats comprise the most popular mo￾dels to study essential hypertension[7]. One example is the
spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), originally inbred from
Wistar stock by Okamoto and Aoki, and their WKY inbred
nonhypertensive controls. These rats develop hyperten￾sion at about 4–6 weeks of age, largely independent of die￾tary levels of either Na+
 or Cl_
. Another model is the Dahl
salt-sensitive rats, originally derived from Sprague-Dawley

yet is free from the disease and the complexity of the genetic
mutations which have affected not only blood pressure but
many other regulatory systems as well.
Transgenic hypertension models can be generated by
over-expressing a specific gene. This type of genetic model
usually has a relatively good normotensive control, the same
strain of animals without genetic alteration. It is an excel￾lent model to study the role of a specific gene in the patho￾genesis of hypertension. However, the transgenic model may
not mimic human essential hypertension as well as the SHR
does in terms of pathophysiology. A representative of this
type of hypertension is the TGR (mREN2)27 transgenic rats[10].
In this genetic model, the introduction and overexpression
of the mouse Ren-2 gene in Sprague-Dawley rats leads to
severe hypertension[10]. The appropriate control is the age-,
body weight-, and sex-matched normotensive Sprague￾Dawley rats without renin transgene.
Environmentally-induced hypertension In recent
years, the important role of environmental factors in the dis￾ease process has received great attention from scientists and
physicians. The primary interest is focused on the area of
cardiovascular disorders, particularly hypertension. To un￾derstand better the ways in which the environmental factors
affect the cardiovascular functions, researchers have tried to
produce experimental hypertension in animals by exposing
them to different experimental paradigms.
Stress-induced hypertension Epidemiologists and cli￾nicians have long suspected that stressful life events can be
a sufficient trigger for the expression of hypertension in some
individuals[20]. Attempts to induce hypertension in animals
using sensory stimulation have generally employed loud
noises, flashing lights, and oscillating cages, either separately
or together. For example, in one early study rats were sub￾jected to 20 weeks of randomized flashing lights, motion,
and loud noises[21]. After 12 weeks on this schedule, systolic
blood pressure (SBP) values reached approximately 150–
160 mmHg. Perhaps a better example of this type of experi￾ment is found in a study by Lin and Li[22]. Stressed rats de￾veloped hypertension within two weeks after irregular foot
electric-shocks combined with buzzing noise. It is accepted
that activation of sympathetic nervous system[23] and the RAS[24]
play a role in the initiation of stress-induced hypertension.
Li[25] found that increased activity of the cholinergic system
in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (rVLM) was also involved
in the development of stress-induced hypertension. Plasma
catecholamine, corticosterone, angiotensin II, glucose, and
lipids were found to be increased during stress. In this model,
about 40%–50% of stressed rats failed to develop hyperten￾sion[26].
Diet-induced hypertension It is known that long-term
exposure to a special diet (high salt, fat, or sugar) results in
dietary hypertension in some animals or humans. For
example, chronic fructose treatment in rats repeatedly has
been shown to elevate blood pressure associated with insu￾lin resistance and hyperinsulinemia[27,28]. Hyperactivity of
the SNS and the RAS, vascular hypertrophy, and sodium
retention by the kidney tubules have been proposed to be
some of the mechanisms by which fructose induces
hypertension. By degeneration of capsaicin-sensitive nerves,
Wang and colleagues[29,30] developed a salt-sensitive model
of hypertension. In this model, the increased salt sensitivity
is mediated by the enhancement of the SNS[29].
Cold-induced hypertension: Fregly[31] and Sun[32–36] found
that chronic exposure of rats to mild cold (41 °F or 5 °C)
induced hypertension including cardiac hypertrophy within
3 weeks. This is presently the only “naturally-occurring”
form of experimentally-induced hypertension that is induced
without surgical intervention, administration of excessive
doses of drugs or hormones, or genetic manipulation. It is
interesting that the elevated blood pressure of rats after 7
weeks of exposure to cold does not return to pre-cold expo￾sure level during the 4 weeks after removal from cold. Thus,
an elevation of blood pressure induced by a longer period of
cold exposure might not be reversible after return to
thermoneutral temperature. Intermittent exposure of rats to
cold also induces hypertension, with a sigmoid relationship
between the hours per day exposed to cold and systolic
blood pressure.
Cold-induced hypertension (CIH) is also demonstrable
in humans. Epidemiological surveys and clinical observa￾tions have established that people who live and work in cold
areas have a high incidence of hypertension and related car￾diovascular diseases[37–39]. Cold temperature (weather) makes
hypertension more severe in hypertensive patients[39,40]. The
cold winter season has the highest mortality and morbidity
of cardiovascular diseases in a year[39–42]. Donaldson[38], af￾ter studying the relationship between outdoor temperature
and blood pressure in men in central London between 1986
and 1992, reported that cold exposure of normal life in win￾ter is sufficient to induce significant and prolonged hyper￾tension in the general population.
It was originally assumed that cold-induced elevation of
blood pressure was a direct vasoconstrictive effect of sym￾pathetic nervous system (SNS). Indeed, the SNS is acti￾vated by chronic cold exposure and the plasma and urine
levels of catecholamines are increased significantly in cold￾exposed rats[32–34,43]. However, the in vitro vascular contrac￾tile response to α1-adrenoceptor agonist, phenylephrine, is

298
Sun ZJ et al Acta Pharmacologica Sinica ISSN 1671-4083
decreased significantly in cold-exposed rats[44]. The in vivo
pressor response to phenylephrine is significantly reduced
by chronic cold exposure[45]. Thus, the vascular α1-adreno￾ceptors are down-regulated during cold exposure. Several
studies[32,34,36,46] have shown that blockade of the RAS at
different sites could attenuate or prevent the cold-induced
elevation of blood pressure. Antisense oligodeoxynucleo￾tides to angiotensinogen mRNA or AT1-receptor mRNA re￾duce elevated blood pressure of cold-exposed rats[47]. Angio￾tensinogen gene knockout delays and attenuates CIH[48]. It
has been therefore suggested elsewhere[32–34,36,48] that the
hyperactivity of the SNS initiates CIH probably via activa￾tion of the RAS. Indeed, plasma renin activity (PRA) is in￾creased during exposure to cold and abolishment of the rise
in PRA by renal denervation prevents the development of
CIH[32]. Cold-exposed rats had an elevation of blood pres￾sure that was proportional to the concentration of NaCl in
the diet[49], suggesting that CIH is sodium-dependent
hypertension.
CIH is a prototypic model of environmentally-induced
hypertension, which is similar in many ways to human
hypertension. Induction of CIH requires a climate-controlled
chamber, with a strict requirement of temperature and
humidity. Perhaps, this is the limitation of this model.
Pharmacologically-induced hypertension The DOCA￾salt-induced model of hypertension is a typical representa￾tive of pharmacologically-induced hypertension. A very high
dose of deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) ranging from
about 300 to 1000 mg⋅kg-1⋅d-1 (sc) is required to induce hy￾pertension in rats. Isotonic saline is the sole drinking fluid.
This is an important co-factor because it expedites the deve￾lopment of hypertension and makes it more severe. Thus,
this model is salt-dependent in its initiation. It often needs
surgical reduction of renal mass or unilateral nephrectomy.
The combination of DOCA-salt and unilateral nephrectomy
results in hypertension, cardiac and renal hypertrophy, and
nephrosclerosis[50]. DOCA-salt hypertension is a low renin
and volume overloaded form of hypertension. There is evi￾dence that arginine vasopressin (AVP) plays a role in both
the development and maintenance of DOCA-salt hyperten￾sion[51,52]. It is believed that AVP is involved as a vasopres￾sor hormone in the pathogenesis of malignant DOCA-salt
hypertension[53]. The SNS also appears to be involved in
the development of DOCA-salt hypertension[54]. The in￾creased activity of the SNS may affect renal function through
the renal nerve, as denervation of the kidneys delays the
onset and decreases the severity of the disease[54,55]. Fur￾ther studies[56] indicated that AngII receptor binding sites
were increased in the brain, suggesting an up-regulation of
AngII receptors. However, AngI converting enzyme inhibi￾tors and AngII receptor blocker are ineffective in reducing
blood pressure in low-renin, DOCA-salt hypertension[57,58].
In contrast, aldosterone receptor blockers and diuretics are
effective in reducing blood pressure in this model[59]. Most
recent studies indicate that the endothelin system plays an
important role in the pathogenesis of DOCA-salt hyperten￾sion[60–65]. Oxidative stress may also be involved in DOCA￾salt hypertension[65,66]. The major limitations of the DOCA￾salt model are: 1) the pharmacological (large) doses of drug
required; 2) requirement for surgical reduction of renal mass;
and 3) ingestion of a large amount of NaCl required. The
major advantage of this model is the potential to investigate
the role of sodium in the developmental stages of hyperten￾sion.
Renal-induced hypertension The physiological function
of the kidney includes maintenance of electrolyte and fluid
balance and secretion of renin, an important component of
the RAS. Thus, its involvement in the regulation of blood
pressure and its important role in the development of hyper￾tension are well accepted. Since 1934, when Goldblatt and
his co-workers[67] induced an elevation of blood pressure by
partial constriction of the renal artery of the dog, many renal￾induced models of hypertension have been successfully
established in rats, rabbits, sheep, and cats[68]. Generally,
renal-induced experimental hypertension includes two-kid￾ney Goldblatt hypertension (constriction of one renal artery
while the contralateral kidney is left intact) and one-kidney
Goldblatt hypertension (one renal artery is constricted and
the contralateral kidney is removed).
In the rat, by clipping one renal artery (leaving the con￾tralateral kidney untouched) with a clip which induced a se￾vere hypertension, a biphasic course in the plasma renin
activity was found. In the initial phase, sodium retention
occurred and was associated with a transient increase in
plasma renin activity returning to control levels within a
week[69,70]. Thus, it has been suggested that the RAS plays
a role in the development of two-kidney Goldblatt hyperten￾sion[69-71]. The sustained elevation of blood pressure may
still be AngII-dependent since a sub-pressor dose of AngII
would result in an elevation of blood pressure due to a shift
in the dose-response curve of AngII[72]. This suggests, but
does not prove, that AngII receptors are upregulated in this
model of hypertension. The initial elevation of blood pres￾sure in the one-kidney Goldblatt model is also AngII-medi￾ated[73]. Due to the absence of the other normal kidney, no
compensatory increase in sodium and water excretion can
occur, and hence, fluid volume is retained[74]. This model is
thus a sodium-fluid volume-dependent model. This would

Http://www.chinaphar.com Sun ZJ et al
299
be an ideal model for studying the role of volume expansion
in the development of hypertension.
During the early developmental stage of these two renal￾dependent models, when the clip is removed, arterial blood
pressure returns to normal[70,75]. Thus, renal-induced hyper￾tension is reversible and reproducible. Furthermore, these
models provide a unique opportunity to investigate the
changes which occur specifically at the level of the kidney,
as well as the role of the kidney in the long-term blood pres￾sure control. If the reversal of hypertension is time-depen￾dent, it would suggest that relevant changes, perhaps
structural, have developed.
Clinical implications of animal models of
hypertension
It should be mentioned that each of the above models of
experimental hypertension studies a specific aspect of
hypertension. Neither of them encompasses all traits of hu￾man essential hypertension. Due to the unknown etiologies
of hypertension, the use of various research models, each of
which induces the disease by a different mechanism yet with
the same end result, is advantageous. By using different types
of experimental hypertension, scientists could identify and
evaluate potential risk factors contributing to hypertension
and related cardiovascular diseases. This would allow new
and effective measures to be adopted for preventions and
therapies. Usually, animal studies are essential to the suc￾cess of clinical trials. It is noted that remarkable advances
in cardiovascular medicine have been originated from ex￾perimental hypertension. Therefore, animal models of hy￾pertension are very important approaches to the study of
human hypertension.
Physicians and scientists could learn the developmental
process and pathogenesis of hypertension from these animal
models that are designed to mimic those of human
hypertension. The induction of hypertension in animals could
help understand the etiological factors that may be involved
in essential hypertension. For example, hypertension and
cardiovascular diseases (CVD) may have genetic predeter￾minants. There is a predisposition to hypertension and CVD
in those patients with a positive family history. The notion
of genetic predisposition for the development of hyperten￾sion has been strengthened by the development of genetic
or spontaneous models of hypertension. The pathophysi￾ological changes of spontaneous hypertension in animals
are very similar to those of human essential hypertension.
Also, transgenic models of hypertension induced by target￾ing different genes are excellent tools to study genes rel￾evant to hypertension. An animal model of DOCA-induced
hypertension is an ideal model for evaluating the role of
sodium in hypertension. Studies from DOCA-induced hy￾pertension have provided a strong basis for using spirono￾lactone (aldosterone receptor blocker) to treat clinical
hypertension. Because some special diets (high salt, fat, or
sugar) could result in dietary hypertension, restriction of these
diets has been suggested by clinicians for preventive and
therapeutic purposes. The cause of hypertension varies with
hypertensive patients. Thus, it is important to identify the
potential cause of hypertension prior to treatment; which
guarantees appropriate and effective treatment. For example,
stenosis of the renal artery could cause hypertension as
learned from an animal model of renal-induced hypertension.
In this case, surgical correction of the stenosis of the renal
artery may be more important than treatment with antihy￾pertensive drugs. In addition, research findings from ex￾perimental hypertension may have clinical implications. For
example, the RAS has been found to play a critical role in
the pathogenesis of CIH in rats. This has led to a clinical
trial which proves that the ACE inhibitor (captopril) or AT1
receptor blocker (losartan) can control hypertension appro￾priately and effectively in hypertensive patients in winter.
This also could help to control the high incidence of myo￾cardial infarction and stroke during the cold season. In
contrast, the use of animal models of hypertension would
allow scientists to test new pharmacological treatments and
gene therapy for hypertension and related CVD. Thus, what
is learned from animal hypertension may reveal new insights
into both preventive strategies and optimization of therapeutic
approaches. It should be emphasized that any experimental
data from animal models of hypertension must be tested and
further validated in humans before they can be applied in
hypertensive patients.
