Abstract
Secondary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by an in￾crease in parathyroid (PT) cell number, and parathyroid
hormone (PTH) synthesis and secretion. It is still unknown
as to what stimuli regulate PT cell proliferation and how
they do this. We have studied rats with dietary-induced
secondary hyper- and hypoparathyroidism, rats given 1,25-
dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) and rats after 5/6 ne￾phrectomy for the presence of PT cell proliferation and
apoptosis. PT cell proliferation has been measured by stain￾ing for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and
apoptosis by in situ detection of nuclear DNA fragmentation
and correlated with serum biochemistry and PTH mRNA
levels. A low calcium diet led to increased levels of PTH
mRNA and a 10-fold increase in PT cell proliferation. A
low phosphate diet led to decreased levels of PTH mRNA
and the complete absence of PT cell proliferation.
1,25(OH)2D3 (25 pmol/d x 3) led to a decrease in PTH
mRNA levels and unlike the hypophosphatemic rats there
was no decrease in cell proliferation. There were no cells
undergoing apoptosis in any of the experimental conditions.
The secondary hyperparathyroidism of 5/6 nephrectomized
rats was characterized by an increase in PTH mRNA levels
and PT cell proliferation which were both markedly de￾creased by a low phosphate diet. The number of PCNA
positive cells was increased by a high phosphate diet. There￾fore hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia and uremia lead to
PT cell proliferation, and hypophosphatemia completely
abolishes this effect. Injected 1,25(OH)2D3 had no effect.
These findings emphasize the importance of a normal phos￾phate and calcium in the prevention of PT cell hyperplasia.

thyroid (PT)' cell number, in addition to the major increase in
the function of each cell to express more parathyroid. hormone
(PTH) mRNA and secrete more PTH. The stimuli which lead
to increased PTH gene expression, translation and secretion are
well characterized. In vivo, these include low calcium, high
phosphate and estrogens (2-4). The factors which lead to de￾creased PTH gene expression in vivo are 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin
D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) (5) and low phosphate (3). In vitro the
action of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 can be enhanced by retinoic
acid (6). The stimuli to PT cell hyperplasia are less well de￾fined.
Parfitt (1) has analyzed the literature on PT cell replication,
and concluded that after cessation of growth, few PT cells divide
more than twice, and many do not divide at all. He suggested
that since the adult PT cell number does not change, the very
slow rate of cell gain must be balanced by a correspondingly
slow rate of cell loss ( 1). The parathyroid normally has very
few mitoses but it has the potential to replicate after stimuli
such as a chronically low serum calcium (2). An analogous
situation might be the adrenal cortex which becomes hyperplas￾tic after chronic stimulation with its trophic hormone, adrenal
cortical trophic hormone (ACTH), or the thyrotrophic cells of
the pituitary which become hyperplastic after thyroidectomy
without thyroxin replacement therapy. This indicates that these
cells retain a stem cell potential which is normally not ex￾pressed. Stereoscopic electron microscopy studies have shown
that the parathyroid cells of rats fed a low calcium diet for 3
wk are hypertrophied (7, 8), and flow cytometry estimation of
parathyroid cell number showed that there was a large increase
in PTH gene expression per cell and only a moderate increase
in parathyroid cell number (2). However, patients with chronic
renal failure are maintained on hemodialysis treatment for years
and in this situation the parathyroid cell hyperplasia becomes
a major clinical problem resulting in the synthesis of large
amounts of PTH (9, 10). This excess PTH leads to tremendous
bone resorption, osteitis fibrosa cystica, which is a central fea￾ture of renal osteodystrophy. It is therefore of prime clinical
importance to understand the pathogenesis of PT cell hyperpla￾sia and to determine what causes the PT cell to proliferate.
The onset of DNA replication and mitosis, the two key cell￾cycle events is a tightly controlled event. In yeast and eukaryotic
cells in culture there is a cascade of cyclins (D, E, A, B) which
are sequentially activated to take the cell through the different
phases of the cell cycle. Their activity is in balance with those
of cyclin kinase inhibitors, such as p27 and p21, and when
the activities of the different cyclin kinases exceed that of the
inhibitors then the cell enters the cell cycle (11). The human
nuclear protein, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), so

named because of its initial discovery as a cell-cycle dependent
antigen (12), is a cofactor of DNA polymerase 6 (13). PCNA
is important in cellular DNA synthesis and in cell cycle progres￾sion where it acts as a processivity factor or sliding clamp for
DNA polymerase 6 (14). Crystal structure of PCNA shows that
three PCNA molecules encircle duplex DNA, providing a DNA￾bound platform for the attachment of the polymerase (15).
Antisense oligonucleotides to PCNA added to exponentially
growing Balb/c3T3 cells completely suppressed their growth
( 16). When cells enter the cell cycle and are proliferating their
nuclei stain positively for PCNA and this immunohistochemical
test is now a sensitive test for cell proliferation in histology
sections (17). We have used PCNA staining to characterize the
regulators of cell proliferation in the parathyroid from rats fed
diets with different amounts of calcium, phosphate and vitamin
D, both in normal rats and rats with chronic renal failure due
to 5/6 nephrectomy. The results show that in those situations
where there is an increase in PTH mRNA and serum PTH, such
as hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia and chronic renal failure,
there was an increase in PT cell proliferation. In an experimental
model where there is a decrease in PTH mRNA due to hypo￾phosphatemia there was a complete absence of proliferation,
however, after 1,25(OH)2D3 at a dose which decreased PTH
mRNA there was no change in the number of proliferating PT
cells.
Programmed cell death or apoptosis is associated with en￾dogenous endonuclease activity which results in the cleavage
of chromatin at linker DNA sites between nucleosomes (18,
19). The ultimate DNA fragments are 180-bp nucleosomal units
which appear as "DNA laddering" in standard agarose gels of
DNA extracted from apoptotic cells. Gavrielli et al. (20) have
developed a method for the in situ labeling of DNA breaks in
nuclei in tissue sections at the single cell level while preserving
tissue architecture. The method is based on the specific binding
of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) to 3 '-OH ends
of DNA and incorporating biotinylated deoxyuridine at sites of
DNA breaks. The signal is amplified by avidin-peroxidase and
identified by light microscopy. We applied the method of TdT￾mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) to the PT
tissue from rats with dietary hyper- and hypoparathyroidism
and after 1,25 (OH)2D3 administration and in no situations were
there PT cells undergoing apoptosis as measured by ppsitive
TUNEL staining.
Methods
Animals
Weanling male Hebrew University strain rats were maintained for 3 wk
on the following diets (Teklad, IL): Low phosphate, normal calcium
(0.02% phosphate, 0.6% calcium); normal phosphate, normal calcium
(0.3% phosphate, 0.6% calcium); high phosphate, high calcium (1.2%
phosphate, 1.2% calcium); vitamin D deficient, low calcium (0.02%
calcium). After 1 to 21 d the thyroparathyroid tissue was excised under
pentobarbital anesthesia, and blood samples taken. All rat surgery was
performed at 9-10 am. The excised tissue was immediately frozen in
liquid nitrogen and stored at -70°C for RNA extraction, or fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde and paraffin blocks prepared for histological analysis.
5/6nephrectomy (5/6NX) was performed on 180-220 gram male rats
in a two-stage procedure under ether anesthesia as previously reported
(21). The 5/6 nephrectomized rats were then fed diets with different
phosphate contents as above for two weeks after the second operation.
Measurement of cellular mRNA levels
RNA was extracted from rat thyroparathyroid tissue and the levels of
PTH mRNA were measured by Northern blots after extraction with TRI
Reagent (Molecular Research Center Inc., Cincinnati, Ohio). RNA was
denatured and ethidium bromide was added to each sample at a concen￾tration of 0.1 mg/mil. The samples were size-fractionated by electropho￾resis on 1.25% agarose gels containing formaldehyde and transferred to
Hybond filters (Amersham, England) by diffusion blotting. The integrity
of the RNA and the uniformity of RNA transfer to the membrane were
determined by UV visualization of the ribosomal RNA bands of the
gels and the filters. The filters were fixed by UV cross-linking and
hybridized as previously described (4, 5). Hybridization was to a ran￾dom primed rat PTH cDNA (a gift of H. Meyer, GBF, Braunschweig,
Germany) and 18S RNA (gift of M. A. Levine, Baltimore, MD).
Immunohistochemistry
Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Paraffin tissue blocks were
cut to 4-6-mm-thick sections, deparaffinized in xylene and alcohols,
and placed for 15 min in alcohol-H202, 3%, for blocking endogenous
peroxidase. To reveal masked antigens in formalin-fixed, paraffin-em￾bedded tissue sections, slides were placed in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) and
treated in the microwave at 920C for 10 min. After removing container
from the microwave and cooling for 15 min, slides were placed in PBS
(pH 7.6). Sections were then treated with Bovine Serum Albumin
(BSA) to prevent background staining, and incubated for one hour
with the primary antibody PCNA-PC-10 (Zymed Laboratories, Inc., San
Francisco, CA) at room temperature in a humidified chamber (22, 23).
Slides were rinsed with PBS for 3-4 min and incubated with the biotin￾ylated linked antibody for 30 min and with the labeling reagent peroxi￾dase conjugated streptavidin for 30 min (Bio Genex Laboratories, San
Ramon, CA). After rinsing, the peroxidase label was demonstrated
using 3-amino-9-ethyl carbazole (AEC) for 15 min, and counterstained
with Mayer Hematoxylin. AEC produces a red end-product that is solu￾ble in alcohol and is used with an aqueous mounting media (kaiser's
glycerol gelatin). A negative control was run using the same technique
but omitting the primary antibody and adding the streptavidin-biotin
complex. PCNA positive cells were counted per microscope field with
the PT section completely filling the microscope field. For each rat
four microscope fields were counted and the mean used. The variation
amongst sections in each rat was always < 10%. Each group represents
the mean±SEM of 4-5 rats.
DNA nick end labeling of tissue sections
This was performed essentially as described (20). Tissue sections were
treated with proteinase K, washed four times, treated with 2% H202,
rinsed and immersed in buffer with biotinylated dUTP and rinsed. The
sections were covered with Extra-avidin peroxidase (BioMakor, Reho￾vot, Israel), washed and stained with AEC for 30 min (20).
Serum measurements
Serum calcium and phosphate were measured in a Roche autoanalyzer.
Serum 1,25 (OH)2D3 levels were measured by a radioreceptor assay
(Incstar, Minneapolis, MN). Serum iPTH levels were measured with a
rat immunoradiomimetric assay (Nichols, San Clemente, CA). Statisti￾cal analysis was performed on the Macintosh program Statview 512+,
using Student's unpaired two-tailed t test. The results are presented as
the mean±SEM.
Results
Table I shows the serum biochemistry in the weanling rats fed
the different diets for 3 wk. Serum calcium was decreased in
the rats fed a low calcium diet and increased in rats fed a low
phosphate diet. Serum phosphate only changed in the rats fed
a low phosphate diet where it was decreased. Serum
1,25 (OH)2D3 was markedly increased in rats fed both the low
calcium and the low phosphate diets, and decreased by the high
phosphate diet.
PTH mRNA levels were increased in the rats fed the low

calcium diet and markedly decreased in the rats fed a low phos￾phate diet (Fig. 1) with no changes in a control gene 18 S RNA
(not shown) and as previously reported (2, 3). PCNA staining
of thyroparathyroid tissue showed that there were 10 PCNA
positive cells per microscope field in the PTs of a control rat
10 d after weaning and there was a sixfold increase in weanling
rats fed a low calcium diet for 10 d (Figs. 2 and 3). After 21
d of diet there was a smaller number of PCNA positive cells
in the control rats (P < 0.05) as compared with rats at 10 d
after weaning and those rats on a low calcium diet had a 3.6-
fold increase in PCNA positive cells (Figs. 2 and 3). After a
low phosphate diet for 21 d there were no PCNA positive cells
at all (Figs. 2 and 3) as well as a marked decrease in PTH
mRNA levels (Figs. 1 and 3). Rats fed a high phosphate diet
had a moderate increase in PTH mRNA levels (Figs. 1 and 3)
and more PCNA positive cells than the controls, but not nearly
as much as rats fed a low calcium diet (Fig. 3).
5/6 Nephrectomized rats have increased PTH mRNA levels
as compared with control rats (21). A high phosphate diet did
not increase serum phosphate (Table II) or PTH mRNA levels
significantly (Fig. 4). A low phosphate diet led to a decrease
in serum phosphate and an increase in serum calcium (Table
II) and with this there was a marked decrease in PTH mRNA
levels (Fig. 4). There was no change in a control gene 18 S
RNA (not shown). Serum 1,25 (OH)2D3 levels were increased
by a low phosphate diet (95+9: 165±+12 pg/ml; control: low
phosphate; mean±SE (n = 4), P < 0.01). PCNA staining of
parathyroid tissue from these rats showed a small number of
positive cells in control mature rats with normal renal function,
an increased number of PCNA positive cells in 5/6 nephrecto￾mized rats fed a control diet and this was further increased by
a high phosphate diet (Figs. 5 and 6). The 5/6 nephrectomized
rats fed a low phosphate diet had a marked reduction in the
number of PCNA positive cells to numbers even less than con￾trol rats with normal renal function (Figs. 5 and 6).
PTH mRNA levels were reduced by injecting rats with
1,25 (OH)2D3 (3 daily injections of 25 pmol) at 21 d after
weaning and studied 24 h later. Their serum biochemistry
showed that there were no changes in serum calcium
(10.2+0.2:10.6±0.2 mg/dl, control: 1,25(OH)2D3; P NS) or
phosphate (10.2±0.3:10.5±0.3 mg/dl, control: 1,25(OH)2D3;
P NS) but 1,25 (OH)2D3 led to a decrease in PTH mRNA levels
(100±5: 40±6%, control: 1,25(OH)2D3 treated, mean±SEM
(n = 5), P < 0.01) as previously reported (5). There was no
change in the number of PCNA staining positive cells (Fig. 2).

mRNA levels there was no decrease in the number of proliferat￾ing cells. This experiment therefore showed that there was no
direct relationship between PTH mRNA levels and PCNA posi￾tive cells.
In many situations where there is accelerated cell prolifera￾tion there is a corresponding accelerated cell apotosis such as
in the small intestine. We therefore studied whether there were
PT cells undergoing apoptosis in these experimental models of
dietary hyper- and hypoparathyroidism. Rats fed diets with a
low calcium, low and high phosphate as well as rats after three
daily injections of 1,25 (OH)2D3 (25 pmol daily) were studied.
In all the groups studied there were no apoptotic cells seen by
the TUNEL method (not shown). As a control for the accuracy
of the TUNEL method small intestine from normal rats and
malignant melanoma and breast cancer tissues were studied at
the same time. They all showed the expected number of apop￾totic cells (20). Therefore, the PT gland is characterized by
the ability to respond by increasing or decreasing PTH gene
expression, PTH secretion and PT cell proliferation. There was
no evidence of PT cell programmed cell death as measured
by the TUNEL method after changes in dietary calcium and
phosphate and injections of 1,25 (OH)2D3 in the present experi￾ments. The TUNEL method is reported to be an accurate mea￾sure of DNA nicks present in apoptotic cells but the classic
definition of apoptosis is by morphology which was not studied
here.
Discussion
PCNA staining of nuclei is a sensitive and reliable index of the
S phase of cell proliferation which is now routinely used in the

study of human pathology specimens ( 17). Previous studies on
PT cell hyperplasia have used relatively insensitive techniques
such as counting mitoses (24) or flow cytometry determination
of PT cell number after dispersion of PT glands into single cells
(2). The PCNA staining provides a sensitive and reproducible
measurement of PT cell proliferation although a possible limita￾tion of the methodology is that it may also measure DNA repair.
Dietary hypocalcemia leads to secondary hyperparathyroidism
with marked increases in PTH mRNA and serum PTH levels
(2). In the present study there was the same increase in PTH
mRNA and with this there was an increase in PT cell prolifera￾tion as measured by PCNA at both 10 and 21 d. Rats fed a high
phosphate diet have a moderate increase in their PTH mRNA
levels and with this a small but significant increase in their
PCNA positive cells. A low phosphate diet leads to a decrease
in PTH mRNA and serum PTH levels (3) and the effect on
PTH mRNA was confirmed in this study, and what was most
dramatic was the tremendous decrease in PCNA positive cells
with this diet. There were no proliferating PT cells as measured
by PCNA in rats fed a low phosphate diet. Hypophosphatemic
rats have other characteristics such as hypercalcemia and in￾creased serum 1,25 (OH)2D3 levels which may also be relevant
to the decrease in PT cell proliferation. Control rats 10 and 21
d after weaning had between 6 and 10 PCNA positive cells per
field (Figs. 2 and 3). Control mature rats (±300 gram body
weight) had 2-3 positive cells per field (Figs. 5 and 6). Mature
rats with experimental chronic renal failure due to a 5/6 ne￾phrectomy have an increase in PTH mRNA indicating second￾ary hyperparathyroidism (21) and a fivefold increase in PCNA
positive cells. Uremic rats fed a high phosphate diet had an
increase in PCNA positive cells but no increase in PTH mRNA.
5/6 Nephrectomy rats fed a low phosphate diet had a marked
decrease in PTH mRNA levels as well as a dramatic decrease
in PCNA positive cells. Therefore, in all these models where
PTH mRNA was increased or decreased there was a correspond￾ing increase or decrease in PCNA positive cells. This raises the
question whether the same process that regulates PTH gene
expression and secretion is involved in the regulation of PT cell
proliferation. However, rats injected with 1,25 (OH)2D3 had the
expected decrease in PTH mRNA levels (5) with no effect
on PT cells staining positively for PCNA. Therefore in this
experimental model PTH gene expression was decreased and
PT cell proliferation was not affected, showing that the signal
for proliferation may be separated from that for PTH gene ex￾pression. Both hypocalcemic and hypophosphatemic rats have
high levels of serum 1,25 (OH)2D3 but hypocalcemic rats have
an increased number of PCNA positive cells and hypophos￾phatemic rats have a decreased number. This indicates that in
these models the effect of calcium and phosphate have a domi￾nant effect on PT cell proliferation over that of 1,25 (OH)2D3.
Modest and brief elevations of serum 1,25 (OH)2D3 did not
affect PT cell proliferation but decreased PTH gene expression.

Cell size was not measured in the present studies but it is
apparent in the photographs demonstrating the presence of
PCNA (Figs. 2 and 5) that hypocalcemia was associated with
large hypertrophied cells as documented by Wernerson et al.
(7, 8), and hypophosphatemia with smaller PT cells. PT cell
hypertrophy may be a stage in the path to cell division.
There are many other differences between the mechanisms
by which calcium and phosphate regulate PTH mRNA levels
compared to 1,25 (OH)2D3. Firstly, 1,25 (OH)2D3 is a sterol

hormone and has a transcriptional effect on the PTH gene both
in vivo and in vitro (5, 25). In vivo both calcium and phosphate
have a post-transcriptional effect (3, 26). In vitro a calcium
responsive element has been characterized in the PTH gene
suggesting a transcriptional role but its physiological relevance
has not been determined (22). Calcium regulates the PT cell
by binding to a calcium sensor on the cell membrane which
activates phospholipase C (27), and it is not known by what
mechanism phosphate regulates the PT cell. It might be directly
or indirectly via a factor which is not serum calcium or
1,25 (OH)2D3 (3). In any event the present study clearly shows
that hypocalcemic rats have an increased PT cell proliferation
and hypophosphatemic rats a decreased PT cell proliferation.
These findings are relevant to the pathogenesis of secondary
hyperparathyroidism and its treatment. Transient increases in
intracellular calcium may have a role in the progression of the
cell through mitosis possibly mediated by changes in calmodu￾lin concentration (28), but what is of particular interest in our
present study on the PT is that the stimulus to proliferation was
a low serum calcium and this has been shown to be associated
with a decrease in intracellular calcium in the PT (29).
In tissues with a high proliferation index such as small
intestine or dormant metastases there is a steady state where
cell proliferation is balanced by cell death (30). Cell death
could be a result of necrosis which was not observed in parathy￾roids or programmed cell death. Programmed cell death or
apoptosis differs from necrosis in that it is characterized by
single cell death in the midst of living cells (19). Apoptosis
was studied in situ at a cellular level by labeling fragmented
DNA with the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) la￾beling technique (20). There were no apoptotic cells in the
parathyroids from rats with secondary hyperparathyroidism due
to a low calcium diet, experimental renal failure or a high phos￾phate diet. There were also no cells undergoing apoptosis in
the parathyroids of rats with secondary hypoparathyroidism due
to a low phosphate diet nor in those injected with 1,25 (OH)2D3. Tissues with known apoptosis such as the small intestine, mela￾noma and breast cancer were studied at the same time and
they had their expected apoptotic indices. Therefore, in these

experimental conditions with different effects on PT cell prolif￾eration there were no PT cells which stained positive for
apoptosis by the TUNEL method. The TUNEL method mea￾sures DNA fragments which are present in apoptotic cells, but
the classic definition of apoptosis is morphologic. It is possible
that histological studies would have detected apoptotic cells not
detected by the staining method used here. Patients with chronic
stimuli for PT cell proliferation should have careful attention
paid to a normal serum calcium and phosphate in order to
prevent the PT cell hyperplasia which these studies show is
largely an irreversible process.
The mechanism of how hypocalcemia leads to an increase
in PT cell proliferation and PT hyperplasia is not known. Studies
in vitro with primary cultures of bovine parathyroid cells have
shown an effect of low calcium to increase PT cell mitoses as
measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation (31-33) but it has
recently been shown that bovine PT cells in culture lose the
calcium sensor mRNA and protein (34) and therefore it is not
clear if the effect observed is mediated by a physiological trans￾duction pathway. However, it is possible that there are other
calcium sensors in the PT which may have recognized the
changes in extracellular calcium concentration. PT cell hyper￾plasia is an important component of the secondary hyperpara￾thyroidism of both chronic renal failure and chronic hypocal￾cemia. The chronic hypocalcemia may be the result of one of
a number of causes, such as dietary calcium depletion as in
intestinal malabsorption (35) or in patients with X-linked hypo￾phosphatemia chronically over-treated with oral phosphate
(36). In chronic renal failure the different factors which may
have a role in the secondary hyperparathyroidism are hypocal￾Parathyroid Cell Proliferation In Vivo 1791

cemia, hyperphosphatemia and vitamin D deficiency. The com￾mon feature of these different clinical conditions is a chronically
low serum calcium. Some patients would also have an increased
serum phosphate such as after chronic phosphate therapy in X￾linked hypophosphatemia and patients with renal failure. It has
been suggested that 1,25 (OH)2D3 decreases PT cell replication
(24, 37) analogous to its effect on cells such as HL60 in tissue
culture (38). However, patients with X-linked hypophos￾phatemia who would have low endogenous serum 1,25 (OH)2D3
levels have been treated chronically with high doses of
1,25 (OH)2D3 for years and despite the 1,25 (OH)2D3 treatment
have developed large hyperplastic parathyroids that have re￾quired treatment with parathyroidectomy (36). In all these clini￾cal situations the stimulus was hypocalcemia but hyperphospha￾temia may have an independent role. Serum phosphate is invari￾ably raised in chronic renal failure and correction of serum
phosphate alone with no changes in serum calcium or
1,25(OH)2D3 corrects secondary hyperparathyroidism (39-41 )
and it is possible but not proven that phosphate may have a
direct effect on the PT cell similar to that of calcium (3). In
patients with intestinal malabsorption both the serum calcium
and 1,25 (OH)2D3 levels would be decreased. Therefore, chronic
hypocalcemia is the one recognized factor which is shared by
these different clinical conditions which lead to parathyroid cell
hyperplasia.
The mechanisms of PT cell proliferation in primary hyper￾parathyroidism and in some PT adenomas (42, 43) and all PT
carcinomas (44) have been elucidated and they may be relevant
to the development of secondary or more likely tertiary hyper￾parathyroidism (45). Primary hyperparathyroidism may result
from a number of different molecular mechanisms such as in
patients with familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) (46,
47) where there is a mutation in the gene coding for the PT
calcium sensor (48), or in multiple endocrine neoplasia where
the clonal proliferating PT cells contain deletions on the long
arm of chromosome 11 (type 1) (49, 50), or inherited mutations
in the RET oncogene (type 2) (51-53). These inherited molec￾ular changes are associated with hyperplasia of all four PT
glands similar to the secondary hyperplasia of chronic renal
failure. Most hemodialysis patients with uremic refractory hy￾perparathyroidism were shown by Arnold et al to have at least
one monoclonal parathyroid tumor (54), which suggests that
neoplastic transformation of preexisting polyclonal hyperplasia
may have led to these monoclonal growths (54).
Therefore, the PT cell may be stimulated to proliferate under
appropriate physiological stimuli such as a low serum calcium,
and pathological stimuli such as a genetic alteration in mediators
of signal transduction, the cell cycle or absence of a tumor
suppressor gene where it has the potential to proliferate and
even transform into a malignant cell. It is these lessons which
are now being applied to an understanding of PT cell prolifera￾tion in the secondary hyperparathyroidism of chronic renal fail￾ure in order to design effective preventative and therapeutic
measures.
