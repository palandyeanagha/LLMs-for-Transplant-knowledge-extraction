Abstract
Background: MyBPC3 mutations are amongst the most frequent causes of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, however, its 
prevalence varies between populations. They have been associated with mild and late onset disease expression. Our 
objectives were to establish the prevalence of MyBPC3 mutations and determine their associated clinical characteristics 
in our patients.
Methods: Screening by Single Strand Conformation Polymorphisms (SSCP) and sequencing of the fragments with 
abnormal motility of the MyBPC3 gene in 130 unrelated consecutive HCM index cases. Genotype-Phenotype 
correlation studies were done in positive families.
Results: 16 mutations were found in 20 index cases (15%): 5 novel [D75N, V471E, Q327fs, IVS6+5G>A (homozygous), 
and IVS11-9G>A] and 11 previously described [A216T, R495W, R502Q (2 families), E542Q (3 families), T957S, R1022P (2 
families), E1179K, K504del, K600fs, P955fs and IVS29+5G>A]. Maximum wall thickness and age at time of diagnosis were 
similar to patients with MYH7 mutations [25(7) vs. 27(8), p = 0.16], [46(16) vs. 44(19), p = 0.9].
Conclusions: Mutations in MyBPC3 are present in 15% of our hypertrophic cardiomyopathy families. Severe 
hypertrophy and early expression are compatible with the presence of MyBPC3 mutations. The genetic diagnosis not 
only allows avoiding clinical follow up of non carriers but it opens new possibilities that includes: to take preventive 
clinical decisions in mutation carriers than have not developed the disease yet, the establishment of genotype￾phenotype relationship, and to establish a genetic diagnosis routine in patients with familial HCM.
Background
Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an autosomal
dominant disorder, characterized by unexplained left
ventricular hypertrophy, myocyte hypertrophy and disar￾ray, and interstitial fibrosis [1,2]. It has a frequency of
0.2% in the adult population and is a major cause of sud￾den cardiac death (SD) in young people (< 35 years old).
Ever since the first mutation in the beta myosin heavy
chain (MYH7) gene was described as a cause of hypertro￾phic cardiomyopathy (HCM) in 1990 [3], mutations have
been identified in 11 genes that codify cardiac sarcomeric
proteins [4-7]. Genes that more frequently show muta￾tions are MYH7 and the cardiac myosin binding protein
C (MyBPC3) on chromosomes 14 and 11, respectively.
Mutations in MyBPC3 are responsible for 15-20% of cases
of familial HCM. Besides, available clinical and familial
data are very scarce, making it very difficult to confirm
the pathogenicity of the described mutations and to
establish reliable correlations between genotype and phe￾notype.
Three isoforms of myosin binding protein-C are known
to exist in adult muscle. The three of them have, 10 glob￾ular domains termed C1-C10, 7 of which are immuno￾globulin I-like (IgI-like) domains, with the remaining
three being fibronectin 3 (Fn3) domains. A conserved
linker, termed the S2-binding motif, exists between
domains C1 and C2. There is also a proline/alanine-rich
extension N-terminal of C1. The cardiac isoform has an

additional IgI-like domain at the N-terminus (termed
C0), an amino acid sequence LAGGGRRIS within the S2-
binding motif, and a 28-amino acid insertion within the
C5 domain [8,9]. These domains allow their interaction
with other sarcomeric proteins.
The objectives of this study were first, determining the
frequency and type of mutations in the MyBPC3 gene
within a range of patients with HMC previously studied
for the MYH7 [10] gene; second, describing the clinical
features of the carriers; and third, analyzing the correla￾tion between genotype and phenotype in the identified
mutations.
Methods
(i) Patients
One hundred and thirty unrelated consecutive index
cases from Complejo Hospitalario Universitario A Coru￾ña, Spain, diagnosed with HCM according to the criteria
of the European Society of Cardiology Working Group on
Myocardial and Pericardial Diseases [2]. All the patients
had been previously studied for mutations in MYH7 [10].
We did a prospective follow-up which included the
search for the patient's personal and family history, symp￾toms, physical exploration, electrocardiogram, echocar￾diogram, ergometry, Holter, treatments and events. The
family members were invited to a check-up that included
a clinical study, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram and
genetic study. The clinical characteristics of this cohort
had been previously described [10]. All patients and fam￾ily members signed an informed consent agreement and
the study was approved by the "Comité ético de investi￾gación de Galicia". The study protocol conforms to the
ethical guidelines of the 2008 Declaration of Helsinki.
(ii) Genetic Study
Genomic DNA was extracted from blood anticoagulated
with EDTA with the NUCLEON HT Genomic DNA
Extraction Kit (Amersham Biosciences, UK). The primers
were designed using reference sequence Gen￾Bank:U91629.1[11]. The whole codifying sequence and
the flanking intronic regions of the MyBPC3 gene were
amplified. Genetic screening was carried out through
chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphism
analysis (SSCP) of each fragment using commercial poly￾acrylamide gels 15/24 (T = 15%, C = 2%-GeneGel-Amer￾sham Biosciences, UK). Each fragment was run to pH 8.3
and pH 9.0. The temperature was optimized for each pH
and each fragment. Fragments with abnormal motility
were sequenced using automatic sequencer CEQ 8000
Genetic Analysis System (Beckman Coulter, USA). To
test the sensitivity of SSCP, the direct sequence analysis of
the exon 12 was done for all samples and no false negative
results were detected.
A variant was considered a mutation in accordance
with three criteria: cosegregation with affected members
in the family, absence of the mutation in 200 healthy adult
controls, and the conservation of the mutated residue
among species.
Moreover, the index cases were studied using Seque￾nom MassArray™ system where 537 genetic variants of
HCM disease genes (TNNT2, TNNI3, TPM1, MYL2,
MYL3, ACTC, TTN, MYH6, MYLK2, MYO6, TCAP) were
detected by means of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry
after I-PLEX Gold assay (Sequenom Inc.).
(iii) In silico tools
Splice Site Score Predictions
Programs Splicesitefinder (SSF), Alternative Splice Site
Predictor (ASSP), NetGene2 v2.4, and Human Splicing
Finder splice site analysis (HSF) were used to check if the
exon changes affected splice-enhancing sequences, and if
the intron changes happened in donor or acceptor splic￾ing sites.
Predicting Damaging Amino Acid Substitution
The substitution is predicted to affect protein function
with online programs like Polymorphism Phenotyping
(Polyphen), PMUT, and Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant
(SIFT).
(iv) Genotype-Phenotype Correlation
A descriptive study of the phenotypical features of the
mutation carriers was undertaken. These characteristics
were compared with those of relatives without the muta￾tion in order to study cosegregation and penetrance; tak￾ing into account both sex and age. Furthermore, features
of the carriers were compared with those in cases with
identical mutations previously described in medical liter￾ature.
Results
Sixteen mutations in MyBPC3 were identified in 20 of the
130 index cases (15%). Thirteen mutations located in
exonic regions were concentrated in 8 motives (Figure 1).
Seven of them in, or near, motives implicated in myosin
and/or titin binding (C0, C1, S2 binding, C7, C8 and
linker C9-C10) and the rest of them in motives in which it
is unknown if they establish interactions with other pro￾teins. Three mutations (IVS6+5G>A, IVS11-9G>A and
IVS29+5G>A) were located in flanking intronic regions
and according to the bioinformatics can affect aberrant
transcriptions.
Five of the identified mutations were novel whereas the
other eleven mutations had been previously described
[11-18] (Table 1). All mutations appeared in heterozygou￾sis, except for IVS6+5G>A, which showed up in homozy￾gousis as we have previously reported [19]. None of the

patients with mutations in MyBPC3 showed mutations in
MYH7.
Three of the sixteen identified mutations were found in
more than one family (Table 1). R502Q and R1022P
showed up in two families, respectively, and E542Q
appeared in three of them.
(i) Comparative between the phenotype of individuals with 
mutation: MyBPC3 vs. MYH7
There were no significant differences in maximum thick￾ness among index cases with mutations in MyBPC3
(25(7) mm) and MYH7 (27(8) mm), p = 0.16); and age at
time of diagnosis was similar (46(16) vs. 44(19) p = 0.9)
(Table 2).
(ii) Comparative between the phenotype of individuals 
with and without mutation
There were significant differences in age at time of diag￾nosis, abnormal blood pressure response, in maximum
left ventricular wall thickness and left atrial diameter
between patients with mutation (in MYH7 or MyBPC3)
and patients without mutation (Table 2).
Index cases, with mutation were diagnosed younger (p
= 0.049), had larger abnormal blood pressure response (p
= 0.030), larger left ventricular wall thickness (p = 0.001)
and larger left atrial diameter (p = 0.038).
Index cases with mutation had larger frequency of
familial history and non-sustained ventricular tachycar￾dia than index cases without mutation, although these
differences were not significant.
(iii) Familial genetic study
A genetic study was carried out in 46 positive index cases
relatives: 24 were carriers and 22 non-carriers. Out of
those 24 carriers, 14 showed HCM, 4 with suggestive
electrocardiographic alterations but not HCM diagnostic
(H73-II:6 = D75N H197-III:4 = R502Q, H76-II:7 =
K504del and H160-IV:2 = P955fs,)], and 6 women, ages
25 (H279-III:2 = V471E), 29 (H95-III:6 = E1179K), 32
(H95-III:2 = E1179K), 33(H131-IV:4 = IVS29+5G>A), 49
(H46-III:4 = K504del) and 68 (H73-II:7 = D75N), were
healthy carriers. Within those 22 non-carriers, 18 were
considered healthy, 1 with sugestive electrocardiographic
alterations (H73-II:3 = D75N), 2 probably affected (H49-
IV:1 & IV:5 = R1022P) and 1 case presented HCM (H153-
II:1 = E542Q).
SD as the most serious adverse event was prevalent in 5
of the 20 positive index cases. No genetic test was avail￾able for these cases. SDs occurred in 2 of 3 families with
splice mutations (H56 = IV6+5G>A, H131 =
IVS29+5G>A,), in 1 of 3 with frameshift mutations (H160
= P955fs) and in 2 of 9 with missense mutations (H42 =
A216T, H166 = E542Q).
Eight individuals of five families suffered from SD
between the ages of 15 and 51.
Clinical data of the index cases and carriers can be
found in Additional file 1. Figure 2 and figure 3 showed
the pedigree of frameshift and splice mutations, and new
missense mutations, respectively.

Discussion
This study has allowed us to identify mutation in
MyBPC3 in 15% of our index cases, whereas in MYH7
were 8% in the same cohort [10]. As in other previous
studies, the MyBPC3 mutations are more frequently a
cause of HCM than mutations in MYH7 [18,20-23].
In our study, no family presented two mutations in
MyBPC3 or in MyBPC3+MYH7. However, previously we
have described in this cohort a family with two mutations
(R787H and I736T) in MYH7 [10]. This provides us a
0.8% of multiple mutation cases, a lower percentage than
the described in the literature (≈ 3%) [18,24,25]. As look￾Table 1: Mutations in MyBPC3 gene.

ing for additional mutations, we also tested all patients,
using a genotyping platform which included 537 known
mutations in other HCM disease genes (TNNT2, TNNI3,
TPM1, MYL2, MYL3, ACTC, TTN, MYH6, MYLK2,
MYO6, TCAP). None of the index cases in this study had
additional mutations in these genes. However, it is possi￾ble that there might be new mutations in these genes or
mutations in other genes.
The percentages described in this study, 15% for
MyBPC3 mutations and 0.8% for multiple mutations,
were lower than the described in the literature. The high
percentage described could be due to polymorphic vari￾ants considered as mutations and the inclusion of related
probands. In our study, we considered a variation as a
mutation if it was not present in 200 unrelated healthy
individuals and our index cases were unrelated.
We have not found significant differences between phe￾notypes of MyBPC3 and MYH7 carriers, as it has been
previously described [24].
(i) Not previously described mutations
The pathogenicity of the new mutations must be estab￾lished based upon criteria of cosegregation, absence in
health controls, conservation in the evolution and
planned functional alteration.

Pathogenicity is very likely in mutations to provoke the
introduction of premature stop codons [26,27], including
mutations IVS6+5G>A, IVS11-9G>A, and Q327fs (Table
1 and Figure 2). These truncation mutations could affect
protein binding to the thick filament and they could alter
the sarcomere's structure and function. In fact, these
mutations have been associated to the most severe mani￾festations of HCM and their association with the disease
has been confirmed in animal models [28-30]. However,
functional studies of these mutations will be essential to
elucidate if they act through a dominant-negative mecha￾nism, if the resulting protein continues to be incorpo￾rated into the A-band, or through haploinsufficiency, if
the enhanced proteolysis of the truncated protein rather
alters the stoichiometry of sarcomeric proteins [31].
Pathogenicity is more difficult to confirm in new muta￾tions of the missense type (D75N and V471E). These
mutations did not show up in 200 healthy controls and
they affected conserved residue. Moreover, the use of in
silico tools to predict the pathogenicity of missense muta￾tions showed that D75N and V471E were "likely" to be
pathological (at least two online programs predicted a
damaging effect, Table 1). However, the number of identi￾fied carriers is scarce and there are several cases of
healthy carriers. The presence of healthy carriers is fre￾quent in the mutations in MyBPC3 due to they can have
incomplete penetrance and late development in the
hypertrophy [11]. To explain these cases we can speculate
that, in the case of V471E, one young healthy women car￾riers could have had a late onset of the disease expression,
and in the case of D75N, as the index cases had been
diagnosed at the age of 66, the healthy 68 women could
develope HCM in the following years. In favour of their
relationship with the disease, we have not identified rela￾tives with HCM who do not carry the mutations. Unless,
a relative of D75N index case was probably affected but
does not have the mutation; this fact could mean that
another factor could be contributing to the development
of the HCM.
Therefore, in order to establish the pathogenicity of
new mutation, more data about affected and non-affected
relatives is needed, and this is not always possible, as in
the cases of dead subjects and in those who have declined
to participate.

(ii) Previously described mutations
The identification of a known mutation is clinically more
useful, because previous information allows for a better
evaluation of the pathogenicity and the genotype-pheno￾type correlation. For example, the familial study in muta￾tion K504del does not let us confirm its pathogenicity
(out of four carriers, one is healthy and another one is
questionable, Additional file 1), but the existence of 2 pre￾viously described families [18,21] supports the associa￾tion of the mutation with the disease. In the same way,
one of the families with E542Q mutation (H153) has a
member who is probably affected and who does not have
the mutation. The existence of multiple families in our
study (H166, H641) and in other nine families described
in the literature [14,18,22-24,32-34] allows us to confirm
its association with the disease and it forces us to review
its diagnosis (the light-moderate hypertrophy in the elec￾trocardiogram must be confirmed).
Whereas, in mutation R1022P, two possible HCM
patients do not have the mutation, and in the case previ￾ously described in the literature there are no data about
the familial study [16], so it is not possible to verify its
pathogenicity.
On the other hand we provide useful information for
the clinicians, like in mutation K600fs (Figure 2), our data
confirms the pathogenicity of a previously described
mutation in just one case without available clinical data
or familial study [18].
(iii) Severe and early forms of HCM and SD in patients with 
mutations in MyBPC3
It has been suggested that mutations in gene MyBPC3 are
associated with a light clinical and morphological expres￾sion and with a late development of hypertrophy [11,35].
However, we identify a relevant number of cases with
early severe hypertrophy development, as in the cases of
carriers of the following mutations: R502Q, a post-myec￾tomy 42 year old with 20 mm and another 36 mm case at
15; and P955fs, a 28 mm case at 36 and a 16 year old
female with 21 mm. Moreover, we also have cases with
atrial fibrillation at a young age (K600fs, R1022P,
IVS6+5G>A) and several cases of people who underwent
surgery when they were young (R502Q and IVS6+5G>A).
Figure 3 Pedigrees with the electropherogram of the new missense mutations. Squares are males and circles are females. Filled in black are cas￾es with HCM. Symbols with a black vertical bar represent relatives that were considered possibly affected. N means normal phenotype, empty symbols 
are non-evaluated relatives. The arrows indicate the index patients. Diagonal lines indicate deceased individual. + indicate carriers of the mutation 
and - indicates the non-carriers.

Page 8 of 10
Nevertheless, when we gather data about our families and
those from previous studies [11,14,16,18,21-24,32-35]
(Table 3), we see that in several mutations (R502Q,
E542Q, K600fs, P955fs) average age at time of diagnosis is
not advanced and thickness is above average in HCM.
HCM has been recognized as the most common cause
of SD in the young, especially in competitive athletes [1].
The families associated with SD presented missense
mutations (A216T, E542Q) and mutations that lead to
aberrant transcripts (P955fs, IVS6+5G>A, IVS29+5G>A).
The association between SD and missense mutations
A216T and E542Q is controversial; probably there are
other additional factors that can be interacting. The index
case of A216T was a woman with HCM and thrombotic
problems (she needed two surgical aortic valve replace￾ments and finally went into heart transplantation). On
the other hand, the E542Q mutation was present in 3 of
our 130 families, but only in one of them has cases of SD.
In our families the most strong association of SD with
the mutations is in the mutations that lead to protein
truncation (P955fs, IVS6+5G>A, IVS29+5G>A). In fact,
the youngest SD (15 and 26 year old) are in the
IVS6+5G>A index cases families, and these individuals
are likely to be in homozygousis as in the index case. This
fact could support a gene dossage effect for mutations in
the MyBPC3 gene that have been previously described
where a homozygous mutation is associated with a more
severe phenotype than the heterozygous [19].
Conclusions
We have identified mutations in MyBPC3 in 15% of our
families with HCM. Severe hypertrophy and an early
expression of the disease are compatible with the pres￾ence of mutations in MyBPC3.
Genetic studies can play a key role in the comprehen￾sive evaluation of familiar hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
and in the development of individualized medicine. This
kind of analysis not only allows avoiding clinical follow up
of non carriers but it opens new possibilities including:
taking preventive clinical decisions in mutation carriers
than have not developed the disease yet, the establish￾ment of genotype-phenotype relationship, and establish￾ing a genetic diagnosis routine in patients with familial
HCM.
To obtain these purposes, it is important to perform the
genetic analysis of index cases and in a high number of

about the phenotype of a larger number of carriers, and
to complete the genetic study in the severe cases through
analysis of other genes in order to establish in which
