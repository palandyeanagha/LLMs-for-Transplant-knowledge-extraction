the basic elements of network medicine and emphasize 
strenghts and opportunities in CV diseases with respect to

of “new French insurrection” is needed to concretely shift 
from the current reductionism to personalized CV care.
Human Interactome, Biological Networks, 
Nodes, and Edges
The basic hypothesis of network medicine is that a complex 
disease results from one or more perturbed molecular 
networks that are interconnected in the human interactome 
of disease-related organs (or tissues) and deregulated by 
genetic and/or environmental changes.3,4 Thus, network 
medicine can use the interactome to explore human disease 
etiology.3,4 We reported some basic principles of network 
topology analysis to introduce readers to network medicine 
(see Menche et al5 for more detailed information). A 
biological network is a set of points (nodes) that are linked 
in pairs by lines (edges). Nodes can represent genes, proteins, 
Reductionism has been extremely successful in modern 
medicine by providing enormous advantages in 
identifying specific abnormalities and targeted 
treatments.1 However, it has been accused of oversimplifying 
our models of cardiovascular (CV) diseases, leading to loss 
of information about all the molecular determinants and 
their interactions with the environment, making us not 
sufficiently ready for precision medicine.1 Our contempo￾rary viewpoint of CV diseases takes account individual 
habits, diet, living conditions, comorbidities, and stress 
leading to heart dysfunction, which cannot be predicted by 
the investigation of the single parts alone. Now, systems 
biology can address the dynamic relationship between the 
single parts of a biological system by shifting the attention 
to the whole system, to complement reductionism.1
After the first proof of concept paper,2 Barabási coined 
and popularized the term “network medicine”, which 
combines systems biology and network science to discover 
the molecular drivers of human diseases. Network medicine 
is a holistic approach able to study cells, complex diseases, 
and social networks in a quantitative manner by focusing 
on the molecular pathways contributing to onset and 
progression of CV diseases.3 This approach reflects the fact 
that human phenotypes as well as CV traits are driven by 
complex interactions among a variety of molecular determi￾nants that have to be analyzed at multiple levels, including

Strengths and Opportunities of Network Medicine in 
Cardiovascular Diseases

Concetta Schiano, PhD; Claudio Napoli, MD, PhD
Network medicine can advance current medical practice by arising as response to the limitations of a reductionist approach focusing 
on cardiovascular (CV) diseases as a direct consequence of a single defect. This molecular-bioinformatic approach integrates 
heterogeneous “omics” data and artificial intelligence to identify a chain of perturbations involving key components of multiple 
molecular networks that are closely related in the human interactome. The clinical view of the network-based approach is greatly 
supported by the general law of molecular interconnection governing all biological complex systems. Recent advances in bioinformatics 
have culminated in numerous quantitative platforms able to identify CV disease modules underlying perturbations of the interactome. 
This might provide novel insights in CV disease mechanisms as well as putative biomarkers and drug targets. We describe the 
network-based principles and discuss their application to classifying and treating common CV diseases. We compare the strengths 
and weaknesses of molecular networks in comparison with the classical current reductionist approach, and remark on the necessity 
for a two-way approach connecting network medicine with large clinical trials to concretely translate novel insights from bench to 
bedside.

by enlarging the panel of drug targets or biomarkers.12–17
Strengths and Pitfalls of Network Topology 
Analysis in CV Diseases
Strengths
Network topology analysis has several strengths with 
respect to the traditional reductionist approach in CV 
diseases (Table 2). First, the analysis of molecular networks 
rather than single genes results in a significant reduction of 
the noise and dimension of data, as well as greater biological 
interpretability about genotype-phenotype relationships.3,5
Importantly, network topology analysis abolishes some 
limitations in the current human datasets, in which molec￾ular interactions are described without considering the 
whole context in which they operate. These powerful 
bioinformatic platforms are able to represent a great 
amount of heterogeneous big data in the form of relation￾ships in a very simple and intuitive graphic map (Figure 1). 
For example, Cytoscape is an open-source software platform 
and metabolites, whereas edges represent the physical or 
functional relationships among them, leading to a map that 
is visualized and analyzed using graph theory (Figure 1).3,5,6
These networks form robust and overlapping molecular 
circuits able to govern changes in cardiac gene expression 
in a spatial-temporal manner.3,6
Hypothesis of Disease Network Modules
According to the hypothesis of disease network modules, 
nodes that are strongly associated with a specific patho￾phenotype tend to interact and segregate together in a 
module (or local subnetwork) (Figure 1). This evidence is 
supported by different biological phenomena occurring in 
common CV diseases, such as locus heterogeneity, allelic 
heterogeneity, and variability of phenotype expression, 
emphasizing the need for customized treatments.3,5 Network 
medicine offers many modeling approaches to infer relevant 
disease-gene associations, starting with unbiased analysis 
of big data (Figure 2, Table 1).7–11 This approach has already 
led to tangible discoveries of putative key nodes and path￾Figure 1.  Human interactome, nodes, and edges. Network medicine has its roots in the molecular interconnections, mainly of 
proteins, occurring in cells, tissue and organs, known as the human interactome. The basic elements of network analysis are nodes 
(often shown as circles) and edges, which represent a physical or functional relationship between nodes. Blank circles in Box 1 
represent genes (or proteins) that are topologically close in the interactome. In Box 2, red circles represent known genes, or “seed 
genes” useful to unveil novel gene-gene interactions. By using network algorithms, it is possible to identify novel candidate genes 
(blue circles in Box 3) through their interactions with seed genes and visualize the cluster in discrete modules of the interactome.

phenotype.24 In this regard, the use of large animal models, 
such as dogs, pigs, sheep, and nonhuman primates could 
be considered before translating basic findings into Phase 
1 clinical trials. To date, it is estimated that the human 
interactome only covers 20% of all potential pairwise inter￾actions.5 Because network medicine has its roots in the 
topology of the interactome, its incompleteness is a great 
pitfall when basic findings are translated into the clinical 
arena. Several machine-learning (ML) algorithms are now 
providing additional PPIs to offer better reliability of 
results and novel opportunities for diagnostic tools.25
Importantly, current knowledge about the detailed 3D 
structure of proteins is limited leading to several challenges 
in predicting the outcomes of drug-target interactions, thus 
unexpected side effects continue to be a problem. This is a 
frequent cause of failure in clinical trials, where drugs that 
showed success in vitro fail when used in humans. Remark￾ably, systems biology has provided novel protein structure 
networks, treating a protein as a set of residues linked by 
edges that correspond to the intramolecular interactions.26
However, the clinical use of these platforms is challenged 
by the static view of the proteins that does not reflect the 
cellular dynamicity. Reliance on the accuracy of a gene 
ontology (GO) annotation library is another current gap 
for network medicine. GO terms represent a uniform 
vocabulary about the function of a particular gene by 
describing how a gene is regulated at the molecular level 
and what biological pathways it helps carry out.27 To date, 
researchers largely use GO enrichment methods to analyze 
high-throughput data and gain insight into the biological 
significance of alterations in gene expression levels. 
However, GO terms are assigned either by a human curator 
who performs careful, manual annotation or by computa￾tional approaches that use the basis of manual annotation 
to infer which terms would properly describe uncharted 
for visualizing complex networks and integrating these with 
gene expression data. The most important information 
arises from networks that are constructed in different time 
points showing subtle differences of gene expression profiles 
that really inform us about the molecular processes driving 
the pathogenesis of CV diseases.18–20 Moreover, a huge 
amount of big data is collected and updated in open-to￾public databases, such as GEO, KEGG, DisGeNET, 
STRING, which integrate information on gene-disease 
associations from various public repositories and litera￾ture.3,5 In particular, CardioVINEdb21 is a user-friendly 
independent web interface that can be used with any com￾mon web browser. Furthermore, a network-oriented 
approach can reveal the clinical diseasome to uncover novel 
mechanistic links between diseases that co-occur more than 
expected.22 This integrated approach has revealed that 
comorbidities are not causally related to chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease but can share genes, proteins and 
biological pathways as well as risk factors (such as aging, 
smoking and/or inactivity), which are significantly inter￾linked in the network.23
Pitfalls and Opportunities
Disease network discovery derives from the analysis of 
different data sources, mainly protein-protein interactions 
(PPIs), that are based on yeast two-hybrid systems and 
regulatory networks.3,5 Therefore, identification of molecular 
networks is not based on well-established causal relation￾ships, making necessary extensive validation of in silico 
results by using animal models or human tissue and cell 
coltures.3,5 In particular, researchers can verify if the pre￾dicted disease module really exists by perturbing it through 
pharmacological (e.g., RNA interference) or genetic 
(CRISPR/Cas9) strategies.24 As confirm of computational 
findings, these perturbations should lead to a change in the 
Table 2. Overview of the Strengths and Pitfalls of Network Topology Analysis in CV Diseases
Strengths Pitfalls
Feasible visual representations Absence of translation from animal models to Phase 1 clinical trials
   Intuitive visual representations make crucial CV nodes or 
modules immediately displayed (e.g., Cytoscape)
   In silico predicted disease networks should be validated in larger 
cohorts of CV patients
Free online database Incompleteness of the interactome
   CardioVINEdb is a user-friendly platform containing a large set 
of CV molecular interactions arising from different sources
   Global interconnections among the nodes are still not totally 
known, leading to a gap in identification of disease modules
Novel candidate gene Limited knowledge of 3D protein structure
   Network-based analysis has successfully predicted novel CV 
disease genes
   The 3D protein structure is not available for the majority of 
human proteins, leading to challenges in prediction of outcomes 
in drug-target interactions
Network robustness Reliance on the accuracy of GO datasets
   The network diameter measure can predict the behavior of a 
complex biological system vs. perturbations
   GO annotation is both manual and computational-based and, 
thus it is continuously evolving and affected by several bias
Molecular diseasome Low accuracy of “seed genes” selection
   The molecular diseasome is the representation of diseases that 
are linked when they share associated genes or interaction 
between proteins
   Most of the complex diseases do not have associated candidate 
genes
Clinical diseasome Necessity of dynamic network
   The clinical diseasome is a global map representing the 
interdependence among distinct human diseases when they 
co-occur more than expected at random
   Network maps are static whereas the biological networks that 
they represent are dynamic. Dynamic Bayesian algorithms may 
offer novel opportunities but need further adjustments
Optimizing future drug discovery/drug repurposing Lack of standardized protocols

novel drugs or repositioning approved drugs

biological findings that are difficult to reproduce under 
different conditions.
Why Is It Important to Study the Role of 
PPIs in CV Diseases?
A large list of aberrant protein connectivity has already 
been reported by reductionist studies. One of the most 
representative examples of disease heterogeneity derives 
from inherited hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).31
This reality reflects how the reductionist strategies lack in 
clarifying the dynamic and adaptive features of the genome 
in the larger context of individual genotype-phenotype 
relationships. As emphasized by Maron et al,32 HCM 
represents a useful example for cardiologists to understand 
how the reductionism approach has strongly limited a 
heterogeneous CV disease to sarcomere gene mutations 
whereas network medicine may explain this disease in its 
global dimension. By using network-oriented analyses, we 
gene products.27 Thus, GO and its annotations are continu￾ously evolving and affected by a strong bias that may alter 
interpretation and reproducibility of basic findings over 
time.27 As a consequence, specificity of a PPI pathway that 
regulates a particular cardiac endophenotype (e.g., hyper￾trophy, fibrosis, apoptosis) strongly hinges on the accuracy 
of the GO assignment. Some criticisms also derive from the 
selection of the “seed genes” based on genome-wide asso￾ciation studies (GWAS) that are unable to demonstrate the 
causal effect in the genotype-phenotype relationship.28
Another pitfall regards the static character of some bioin￾formatic tools that are not able to accurately predict the 
dynamic flow of perturbation through biological networks. 
In this regard, Bayesian networks are bioinformatic plat￾forms providing dynamic models based on measures of 
specific variables in different series of samples and CV 
diseases.29,30 Of note, the absence of guidelines/recommen￾dations for biospecimen sources, storage modality and data 
collection, as well as quality control programs, results in 
Figure 3.  Deep phenotyping for precision medicine and personalized therapy of cardiovascular (CV) diseases. Established 
biobanks, such as All of Us Biobank (as part of President Obama’s Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI), https://allofus.nih.gov/). 
EmCABIOBANK, and UK BIOBANK, as well as consortia represent a great source of heterogeneous information about the heart 
and its health/disease state (A). For example, tissue biopsy and in particular liquid biopsy are tools to obtain genetic, epigenetic, 
metabolic, and proteomic data by using omics platforms. Imaging, lifestyle, dietary habits, heart measures, sociodemographic 
data and electronic health records (EHR) can complement big data (A), providing a “deep phenotyping” strategy (B) able to 
dissect the network of knowledge in each layer of information at the individual level. This has 2 main clinical implications in CV 
diseases: personalized therapy (C), in which network-oriented biomarkers may aid in stratifying the risk of CV events and treat 
patients with customized drugs and precision medicine (D), for which network-oriented biomarkers, phenomapping, and machine 
learning may be useful to prevent, diagnose and monitor CV patients.

improve the discovery of novel drugs and molecular targets, 
as well as in silico drug repurposing.3 Experimental studies 
have investigated network-based approach to novel drug￾target identification and drug repurposing useful for 
primary prevention and treatment of coronary heart 
disease. Recently, Lempiäinen et al42 constructed a co￾expression network by integrating GWAS with PPI datasets, 
revealing novel targets for the current cardiometabolic 
drugs, including several kinase enzymes and GPCR genes 
for which drugs already existed, providing new opportunities 
for CHD treatment. To date, none of network-derived 
biomarkers, drug targets, or risk prediction models has 
been implemented in CV clinical care. Actually, network 
medicine is still labeled as basic research, leading to a real 
bottleneck effect (Figure 4). The main challenge is to trans￾late basic findings into the CV clinical setting; thus, meta￾nalysis of large prospective clinical trials is needed 
(Figure 4). Moreover, it should be recognized that there are 
other approaches currently being used to identify novel 
therapeutic targets, such as the “druggable genome”, that 
have already provided an important contribution to the 
concept of personalized medicine in CV research.43
“Foodome” Project: Soil for Epigenetics
The impact of dietary habits on medicine (the “foodome”) 
plays a significant role in quality of life, health and longevity. 
The term “foodome” refers to a collection of all chemical 
compounds present in an investigated food sample at a 
given time, including taste, smell, appearance, texture, and 
nutritional value. Moreover, large-scale computing and 
artificial intelligence (AI) have led to food ingredient 
databases that provide rich details on food contents at the 
chemical level as well as food trade databases that help to 
map food production and supply infrastructure. Network 
medicine is now focusing on the integration of this infor￾mation to uncover new insights about the relationship 
between specific food chemicals and consumption behaviors, 
linking this to health and disease outcomes. Interestingly, 
the ongoing “Foodome” project (https://www.barabasilab.
com/projects) aims to use AI to map, for any given food, 
its form, function, production, distribution, marketing, 
science, policy, history, and culture, as well as the connec￾tions among all these aspects. This human-ML approach 
may be useful to analyze foods preferentially consumed by 
each individual, providing important information about 
lifestyle, which is one of the most important risk factor for 
CV diseases.
A metabolomics platform profiled more than 40 foods, 
including meat, poultry, grains, fruits and vegetables to 
map food-derived compounds.44 The “food metabolome” 
is a field largely unexploited but with a great impact on the 
discovery of novel dietary biomarkers that could reveal 
hidden molecular networks linking food and health/disease 
states and then useful indicators of dietary exposures with 
a high level of precision. It is known that a balanced diet 
can help to prevent or treat CV risk factors, but how does 
food affect our health? Food components and their metab￾olites are emerging as key regulators of epigenetic-sensitive 
mechanisms, which in turn are linked to CV diseases.45
Several bioactive food compounds, such as resveratrol 
(RES), are involved in cardioprotection by modifying chro￾matin structure.46 RES, also known as an epigenetic-based 
drug (epidrug), is the most investigated plant secondary 
metabolite in the foodome era, for which several lines of 
can show how genes interact with each other and unveil 
novel PPIs through known CV disease genes in the human 
interactome.33–35
Strengths and Opportunities of Network 
Medicine in CV Diseases
Precision Medicine and “Phenomapping”
The need for personalized therapy in CV diseases arises 
from the high clinical heterogeneity characterizing CV 
patients. A multi-omics panel of network biomarkers 
may improve traditional population-based risk prediction 
algorithms (e.g., Framingham risk score) in order to identify 
high-risk subjects as well as patients with different diagnosis, 
prognosis, and response to specific drug treatments.36 The 
current reductionist approach has been somewhat successful 
and responsible for the most of the drugs currently used in 
common CV diseases.1,37 One of the main goals of network 
medicine is to provide biomarkers able to identify specific 
groups of patients that will benefit from a given therapeutic 
strategy rather than another avoiding side effects. Collec￾tions of biological materials (biobanks) and electronic 
health records (EHR) for each subject of large study popu￾lation are becoming indispensable tools to really investigate 
causal molecular pathways associated with a CV trait.38
For example, large cohort studies (e.g., FHS) and human 
biobanks (e.g., UK, All of Us, and EmCAB) have provided 
a great amount of molecular/phenotypic data and biospeci￾mens (blood samples, saliva, urine, tissue samples, genetic 
material), which are precious resources for translating 
experimental findings into the clinical setting (Figure 3A).38
Several challenges in network medicine also arise from the 
implementation of biobanks that generally offer population￾specific information, such as genomic background. 
However, it should be also noted that particular nutrition 
habits can alter individual epigenetic profiles, making data 
not extendible to worldwide populations. By using the 
strategy of “deep molecular phenotyping”, network medi￾cine aims to study a CV patient at each level of knowledge, 
including genetics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolo￾mics, and epigenomics, as well as lifestyle habits (e.g., 
foodomics) and clinical information (Figure 3B).
As a result, it may be possible to build a “knowledge 
network” at the individual level, providing a map of the 
aberrant molecular signaling pathways interlinked with 
clinical features suggesting novel useful biomarkers for CV 
precision medicine (Figure 3C). Moreover, it is necessary 
to say that network medicine does not require the interac￾tome per se; indeed, there are examples of using network 
medicine to unravel clinical phenotypes.39 Moreover, ML 
algorithms, such as neural networks and decision tree 
analysis, have been used to test their putative useful role 
in assisting diagnosis and clinical decision-making in CV 
diseases.40,41
Personalized Therapy
The traditional reductionism to drug development focuses 
on the “one-size-fits-all” approach to patient care that uses 
prevention strategy or treatment arising from observation 
of the mean general population.1 In contrast, CV personal￾ized medicine focuses on the identification of “omics” 
biomarkers for risk prevention and prediction of therapeutic 
response (Figure 3D). How could network medicine improve 
CV personalized therapy? Because network medicine can 
reveal crucial molecular interconnections, it can be used to

than mechanistic findings, AI may provide potent platforms 
that improve prevention, diagnosis, prognosis and drug 
response in this field.50,51 In the Multi-Ethnic Study of 
Atherosclerosis (MESA) clinical trial, an integrated ML/
deep phenotyping approach was tested to predict 6 CV 
outcomes in 6,814 asymptomatic subjects over 12 years of 
follow-up.52 By results, this ML platform showed high 
accuracy in predicting CV diseases; however, a deeper level 
of validation should be performed to translate these 
predictive models into clinical practice.52 Remarkably, AI 
is influencing the CV imaging diagnosis of subjects with 
suspected cardiomyopathies, with huge improvements at 
different levels ranging from appropriate patient selection, 
to image acquisition, post-processing and data extrapola￾tion.53 Furthermore, by combining AI and cardiac com￾puted tomography angiography data, a novel biomarker 
named the Fat Attenuation Index (FAITM) has been estab￾lished.54 In detail, FAITM is a measure of adipocyte lipid 
content and size in the perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) 
affected by intra-arterial inflammation that is responsive to 
statins and PCSK9i, suggesting improvements in personal￾evidence show its potential as a drug against CHD.46 RES 
is known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties 
and for its ability to upregulate the endothelial NO synthase 
(eNOS) gene by activating SIRT1, as histone deacetyltrans￾ferase (HDAC).47 However, further long-term clinical 
trials are needed to confirm its beneficial effect in CV 
diseases.47 This highlights the role of the epigenome as a 
sensible target and indicator of nutrient intake in CV 
diseases.47,48 Of course, the field of transgenerational effect 
deserves further investigation in clinical studies owing to 
its great potential to provide early molecular indicators for 
primary prevention of CV diseases.48 Thus, deciphering the 
influence of the foodome on endophenotypes involved in 
fetal reprogramming may be a novel challenge for network 
medicine.
Clinical Road Ahead in CV Diseases
Novel Perspectives From AI
AI is opening novel horizons in the network medicine 
approach to CV diseases. Based on probabilities rather 
Figure 4.  Clinical road ahead in network medicine. Today, network-oriented biomarkers are limited to preclinical validation in 
animal models or human tissue/cells, leading to a “bottleneck effect” that slows down the translation into clinical practice. Of 
course, network medicine needs meta-analyses of large prospective clinical trials, testing both the safety and efficacy of new 
putative drugs or biomarkers. Our acronym “3P-REVOLUTION” contains this message as well as emphasizing the importance of 
physician perception and perspective on patient care, an aspect that presents further challenges for network medicine, including the 
diffusion and the fidelity/acceptance/education of patients and physicians. 3P-REVOLUTION, Physician Perception and Perspective

would be better than reductionism. The next step to imple￾ment the concept of 3P-REVOLUTION is make to use of 
several “European infrastructure development projects” 
(https://www.ecrin.org/activities/projects), for the successful 
exploitation of integrated omics data to reach personalized 
medicine in CV diseases. The challenges are to demonstrate 
the potential and benefits of network medicine for identifying 
new basic knowledge, facilitate multinational trials and 
decision making by linking relevant big data repositories 
while ensuring full compliance with data protection legisla￾tion and ethical principles.

3P-REVOLUTION Challenge
Network medicine offers platforms that systematically 
explore the molecular complexity of a CV disease by 
identifying modules and pathways as well as the molecular/
clinical relationships between distinct pathophenotypes.3,32,55
Of course, progress in this direction is essential to identify 
novel candidate genes, the functional role of GWAS SNPs, 
and epigenetic signatures that may provide useful circulating 
biomarkers, predictive models and novel drug targets.55
Moreover, another challenge comes from the possibility of 
applying network medicine to clarify the direct mechanistic 
link between transgenerational effects and CV diseases by 
studying high-risk families and circulating biomarkers at 
different time points to trace a longitudinal map of the 
epigenome with crucial clinical implications for primary 
prevention.49,50,55 Nevertheless, network medicine is a route 
very hard to walk because it does not represent only a 
computer-aided experimental setting but a radical new way 
of operating in modern CV medicine. Indeed, a “bottleneck 
effect” reflects the current progress in network medicine 
that is largely limited to basic findings only validated in 
animal models or human cells (Figure 4). As mentioned, 
we have introduced the term “3P-REVOLUTION”, which 
tries to emphasize the synergy of 3 components to really 
reach precision medicine of CV diseases, including physician 
evaluation and experience, bioinformatic tools, and clinical 
validation. Indeed, network-derived biomarkers and 
predictive computing models should be investigated in 
randomized long-term clinical trials to translate the basic 
discoveries from bench to CV bedside (Figure 4). Despite 
meaningful advance in clinical research, physicians’ percep￾tion and perspective on care again play a huge role in 
modern CV medicine. We would emphasize this point 
because this era of AI is a double-edged sword that may 
build an aseptic clinical reality. How physicians and 
patients will feel about using and trusting these advanced 
applications is an aspect that should not be overlooked. A 
recent published survey reported several concerns about 
the use of AI from pathologists, especially about the limited 
presence of digital platforms in many centers and the 
possibility of errors leading to medico-legal responsibility, 
suggesting that these will require further in-depth validation 
before effective implementation in daily clinical practice.56
Moreover, we note that several concerns arise from the 
“diffusion” of network-derived drugs and ML predictive 
models (Figure 4). Indeed, interactome-based therapy and 
ML tools might be available for a small number of CV 
diseases and relegated to universities and excellence centers 
rather than to wide diffusion to hospitals and home care 
(Figure 4). These criticisms arise from multiple and difficult 
ongoing challenges, including costs, time, and the necessity 
to educate both patients and physicians to accept and use 
these innovative strategies. Despite its great potential, it 
should be noted that AI cannot replace the relationship 
between physicians and their patients. Indeed, traditional 
fidelity in the physician-patient relationship remains the 
crucial “hub” of the history of medicine and represents an 
additional therapeutic tool that none of most advanced 
technological systems will ever be able to replace. Now 
there is no enough information to claim that this approach
