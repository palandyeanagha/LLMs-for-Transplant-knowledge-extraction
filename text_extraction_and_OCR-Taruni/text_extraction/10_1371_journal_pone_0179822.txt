Abstract
Ischemia-reperfusion (IR)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) is implicated in several clinical
conditions including lung transplantation, cardiopulmonary bypass surgery, re-expansion of
collapsed lung from pneumothorax or pleural effusion and etc. IR-induced ALI remains a
challenge in the current treatment. Carbonic anhydrase has important physiological function
and influences on transport of CO2. Some investigators suggest that CO2 influences lung
injury. Therefore, carbonic anhydrase should have the role in ALI. This study was under￾taken to define the effect of a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, acetazolamide (AZA), in IR￾induced ALI, that was conducted in a rat model of isolated-perfused lung with 30 minutes of
ischemia and 90 minutes of reperfusion. The animals were divided into six groups (n = 6 per
group): sham, sham + AZA 200 mg/kg body weight (BW), IR, IR + AZA 100 mg/kg BW, IR +
AZA 200 mg/kg BW and IR+ AZA 400 mg/kg BW. IR caused significant pulmonary micro￾vascular hyper-permeability, pulmonary edema, pulmonary hypertension, neutrophilic
sequestration, and an increase in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Increases
in carbonic anhydrase expression and perfusate pCO2 levels were noted, while decreased
Na-K-ATPase expression was noted after IR. Administration of 200mg/kg BW and 400mg/
kg BW AZA significantly suppressed the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α,
IL-1, IL-6 and IL-17) and attenuated IR-induced lung injury, represented by decreases in pul￾monary hyper-permeability, pulmonary edema, pulmonary hypertension and neutrophilic
sequestration. AZA attenuated IR-induced lung injury, associated with decreases in car￾bonic anhydrase expression and pCO2 levels, as well as restoration of Na-K-ATPase
expression.

Introduction
Exposure of the lungs to periods of ischemia and the initiation of reperfusion causes ischemia￾reperfusion (IR)-induced acute lung injury (ALI)[1]. IR-induced ALI is an important issue in
lung transplantation[1], which provides a potential cure for patients with end-stage pulmonary
diseases. Despite advances in organ preservation and peri-operative care, IR-induced ALI
remains a significant cause of post-transplantation mortality and morbidity[2]. It has been
widely accepted that effective organ preservation is one of the keys to successful lung and
heart-lung transplantation[2]. Above and beyond of lung transplantation, IR-induced ALI also
affects treatment of cardiopulmonary bypass and re-expansion of collapsed lung associated
with pneumothorax or pleural effusion[3–5] The mortality associated with IR-induced ALI
remains high despite the availability of modern treatments. Thus, there is a need for -more
effective treatments for IR-induced ALI.
Carbonic anhydrase is an enzyme that assists rapid interconversion of carbon dioxide
(CO2) and water into carbonic acid, protons and bicarbonate ions[6–8]. It is widely distributed
in lung tissues including Type I and II alveolar epithelial cells, capillary endothelial cells, and
red blood cells[8, 9]. In the lungs, carbonic anhydrase turns the carbonic acid into CO2 to be
exhaled. Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase activities by acetazolamide (AZA) delaysCO2-medi￾ated pHi decreases, which suggests that there is carbonic anhydrase activity in alveolar epithe￾lial cells with influence of CO2 level[8].
In patients with acute respiratory failure, impairment of gas exchange may lead to accumula￾tion of CO2 in the lungs. It is suggested that hypercapnia may deteriorate lung function[10],
where CO2 can act as a signaling molecule via pH-independent mechanisms resulting in deleteri￾ous effects on epithelial and endothelial barriers, clearance of pulmonary edema, innate immunity,
and host defense[10]. Since carbonic anhydrase catalyzes the interconversion between CO2 and
bicarbonate[11], we postulated that carbonic anhydrase may have a role in IR-induced ALI.
AZA, a sulfonamide derivative, is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor[6] that has been shown to
be effective in the treatment of glaucoma by inhibiting of HCO3
– production[2]. AZA is also
as a diuretics, antiepileptics, treatment for idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and mountain
sickness[6, 12]. However, the therapeutic effects of AZA in IR-induced ALI are not yet known.
Therefore, by applying AZA, we conducted the isolated lung model of IR to study the thera￾peutic effects of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors in IR-induced ALI. We measured perfusate
blood gas, expression and activity of carbonic anhydrase, expression of Na,K-ATPase, pulmo￾nary vascular permeability, pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), lung histopathology, pulmo￾nary edema, total protein, and proinflammatory cytokines in these rats. Understanding the
role of carbonic anhydrase in IR-induced ALI may be helpful in developing new strategies of
carbonic anhydrase inhibitors in treating lung injury.
Materials and methods
Isolation and perfusion of lungs
The National Science Council and the Animal Review Committee of the National Defense
Medical Center (NDMC), Taipei, Taiwan, approved our study protocol. Animals in this study
were cared in accordance with the ‘‘Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” pub￾lished by the United States’ National Institutes of Health. Sprague-Dawley rats used for our
experiment were from BioLASCO Taiwan Co., Ltd and were housed in individually ventilated
cages (450290265 mm). Rats were housed at a temperature of 22 ± 1˚C and humidity of
60 ± 10%, with standard bedding, and maintained on a 12-h light-dark cycle in the animal
facilities at the NDMCLaboratory Animal Center (AAALAC accreditation).

Rats were fed a normal chow diet (Laboratory Autoclavable Rodent diet 5010 with 27.5%
protein, 13.5% fat, 59% carbohydrate). This was a non-survival study that utilized deep anes￾thesia to isolate lung. The rats were without pain sensation and were euthanized at the end of
the experiment.
Male rats were anesthetized through intra-peritoneal injection of zoletil (20 mg/kg). After
deep anesthesia was confirmed, tracheostomy was performed and a cannula was inserted into
the trachea. The lungs were ventilated with a humidified gas mixture containing 5% CO2 in air
at a frequency of 60 cycle/min, a tidal volume of 8 mL/kg, and an end-expiratory pressure of 1
cm H2O.
Fig 1 depicts the experimental procedure schematic for the isolation and perfusion of
lungs. The chest was opened by median sternotomy, and heparin (1 U/g of body weight, BW)
was injected into the right ventricle to prevent blood coagulation. 10–12 mL of intracardiac
blood was withdrawn via left atrial appendage. Following a small incision on the left ventricle,
a catheter was inserted into the left atrium to collect effluent perfusate for re-circulation. Sub￾sequently, a catheter was inserted into the main pulmonary artery (PA) via the right ventricu￾lotomy. The PA and ascending aorta were tied together with a silk suture. PAP and pulmonary
venous pressure (PVP) were measured with a pressure sensor, that was connected to the cathe￾ter. The other end of the catheter was connected to a tube for pulmonary perfusion.
A peristaltic pump (Model 1203, Harvard Apparatus) was used to perfuse the lungs with re￾circulated perfusate composed of blood (10–12 mL) mixed 1:1 with physiologic salt solution
(119 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 1.17 mM MgSO4, 22.6 mM NaHCO3, 1.18 mM KH2PO4, 1.6
mM CaCl2, 5.5 mM glucose, and 50 mM sucrose). Bovine albumin (4 g/dL) was added to
maintain the osmolarity of the perfusate. Perfusion rate was kept at 8–10 mL/min using a roller
pump while constant temperature of 37˚C was maintained by a water bath. The preparation
was placed on an electronic balance with the isolated lungs remaining in situ.

median sternotomy, and 10–12 mL of intracardiac blood was withdrawn via left atrial appendage. One catheter was inserted into the left atrium via a left
ventriculotomy. This catheter was placed in the left atrium to collect effluent perfusate for re-circulation. Subsequently, a catheter was inserted into the
main pulmonary artery (PA) via the right ventriculotomy. The other end of the catheter was connected to a tube for pulmonary perfusion. PA pressure
(PAP) and pulmonary venous pressure (PVP) were measured using a pressure sensor, that was connected to the catheter. A peristaltic pump was used to
perfuse the lungs with re-circulated perfusate. The perfusion rate was kept at 8–10 mL/min by a roller pump while constant temperature (37˚C) was
maintained by a water bath.

Experimental protocols for IR-induced ALI
The IR-induced ALI was performed with 30 minutes of ischemia by stopping ventilation and
perfusion. Following 30-minutes of ischemia, the lungs were re-perfused for 90 minutes and
ventilated with 5% CO2 + 95% air.
The animals were divided into six groups (n = 6 per group): sham, sham + AZA200 mg/kg
BW) (sham-A200), IR, IR+AZA100mg/kg BW (IR-A100), IR+AZA200mg/kg BW (IR-A200)
and IR+AZA400mg/kg BW (IR-A400). AZA (Sanwa Kagaku Kenkyusho Co.,Ltd, Japan) was
500mg dissolved in 5mL normal saline according to the instruction. AZA was administered
via perfusate at the initiation of reperfusion. The rats were analyzed for perfusate blood gas,
micro-vascular permeability (Kf), lung histopathology, lung W/D, total protein concentration,
cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1, 6, and 17), expression and activity of carbonic anhydrase and expres￾sion of Na,K-ATPase.
Perfusate gas analysis
Perfusate blood gas was measured (Radiometer America Inc., Westlake, OH) at baseline, post￾ischemia 30 minutes, post-reperfusion 90 minutes in the sham, IR and IR-A400 groups.
Microvascular permeability (Kf)
An index of Kf was determined from the changes in lung weight(LW) induced by elevated
PVP as previously described[13]. During ventilation and perfusion, the PVP was rapidly ele￾vated by 10 cm H2O for 7 minutes. The slow, and steady phase of LW gain as a function of
time (ΔW/ΔT) was plotted on a semi-logarithmic scale and then extrapolated to time zero to
obtain the initial rate of trans-capillary filtration. From this plot, Kf was defined as the y-inter￾cept (gm/min) divided by PVP (10 cm H2O) and LW (gm), and expressed in whole units of
grams per minute per centimeter of H2O multiplied by 100 g[13].
Total protein concentration in bronchoalveolar lavaged fluid (BALF)
At the end of the experiment, the lungs were lavaged twice with 2.5 mL of isotonic saline. The
returned fluid was collected by free drainage. The BALF was centrifuged at 200 x g for 10 min￾utes, and total protein concentration in the supernatant was determined using bicinchoninic
acid protein assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA).
Pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in perfusate
The expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-1, 6, and 17 in per￾fusate was measured from all rats by commercially available enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent
assay (R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN). Time course of these cytokines was also mea￾sured at baseline, post-ischemia 30 minutes and post-reperfusion 90 minutes in the sham, IR
and IR-A400 groups.
Pulmonary edema
After the experiment, the right lung tissue was removed and the wet weight was determined. It
was then dried in an oven at 60˚C for 48 hours. The wet and dry weights were then used to cal￾culate the lung’s W/D.

Lung histopathology
The lungs were fixed with 10% formaldehyde at 20 cmH2O infused through the trachea. The
tissues were immersed in 10% formaldehyde fixative for 24 hours, embedded in paraffin wax,
and then cut into 4–6 μm-thick sections with a microtome. The sections were stained with
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) to assess lung inflammation and edema.
Lung neutrophil quantification
H&E -stained lung sections were used to quantify the number of neutrophils per high power
field (400X)[14]. For each slide, neutrophils were counted in 10 non-overlapping high power
fields. Each slide was examined by an observer blinded to the study[15].
mRNA expression assay for carbonic anhydrase II
We investigated the expression of carbonic anhydrase II mRNA in the lung tissues by quantita￾tive real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Carbonic anhydrase II because is the most
common form of carbonic anhydrase in lung tissues[8].
Isolation of mRNA was performed using the kit (RNA purification kit: ZYMO Direct￾zolTM RNA MiniPrep) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The quantitative PCR am￾plification reaction was performed using a thermal cycler (Eco Real-Time PCR system, Illu￾mina). Primer sequences to amplify carbonic anhydrase II were synthesized according to
Rn01462065_m1. ß-actin was used as a reference gene while data were normalized using the
comparative cycle-threshold method.
Immunofluorescent staining of carbonic anhydrase II
Formalin-fixed paraffin sections of rat lung (4-μm thickness) were deparaffinized before anti￾gen retrieval. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked by incubating in 3% of H2O2 in methanol
for 15 minutes. The slides were then incubated for 60 minutes with a carbonic anhydrase II
rabbit polyclonal antibody. After washing, slides were sequentially incubated with rat tissue
specific horseradish peroxidase-polymer anti-rabbit antibody (Nichirei Corporation) for 30
minutes. Images were captured using a fluorescence microscope (Leica/DM 2500) equipped
with an EMCCD camera, using SPOT 4.7 advanced imaging software.
Carbonic anhydrase activity
Carbonic anhydrase activity by modified Hansson’s procedure was performed as previously
described[16]. Sections mounted on glass microscope slides were dipped for 2 second into
incubation media containing 5.85 mmol/L KH2PO4, 157 mmol/L NaHCO3, 53 mmol/L
H2SO4, 8.75 mmol/L CoSO4, and 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 5.9. After dipping, the slides were
held in front of a current of moving air for 28 second. Dipping and aerating were repeated 15
times. Aeration facilitated the evolution of CO2 produced locally at sites of active carbonic
anhydrase. With the loss of CO2, these sites become alkaline, causing the precipitation of
CoPO4, which, in turn, is visualized by incubation in 0.5% (NH4)S.
Membranous Na,K-ATPase in lung tissues
Lung tissues were homogenized on ice in a homogenization buffer containing sucrose
(250mM), triethanolamine (10 mM), EDTA (1 mM), EGTA (5 mM), NaF (50 mM), Na3VO4
(1mM). Homogenized lung samples were sonicated on ice and centrifuged at 600 g for 3 min.
The supernatant were centrifuged at 6000 g for 3 minutes. The supernatant were further cen￾trifuged at 18000 g for 10 minutes. Cell membrane was the pellet dissolved with 100μl and was

used for Western blot analysis of Na,K-ATPase α1. Equal amounts of lung homogenates
(30μg/lane) were fractionated on 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacryl-amide gel electropho￾resis and transferred to Hybond polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. The membranes were
blocked by incubation in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat milk for 1 hour at
room temperature. Blots were incubated with an antibodies to Na,K-ATPase α1 (Bioworld
Technology) overnight at 4˚C. The blots were then washed three times for 10 minuteseach in
PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. The blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase linked
anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (1:40,000) at room temperature for one hour, and then washed
three times in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 10 minutes. Bands were visualized using
enhanced chemiluminescence reagents and exposure to radiography film. The blots were then
stripped and incubated with an anti-TATA antibody to ensure equal loading.
Data analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS software 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).
All the values are presented as box plots with median and quartiles. Differences between
groups were evaluated using Kruskal–Wallis followed by post hoc comparisons with Games
Howell tests (intergroup comparison). Repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was
used to analyze differences among time course of blood gas and pro-inflammatory cytokines
in perfusate. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05.

AZA decreased IR-induced pulmonary edema
Pulmonary edema was assessed by lung-weight-to-body-weight (LW/BW) and W/D ratios.
LW/BW (Fig 3A) and W/D ratios (Fig 3B) were significantly higher in the IR group (p<0.05 as

between baseline and post-ischemia (p> 0.05 as compared between the sham, IR and IR with
AZA groups at baseline and post-ischemia). At post-reperfusion 90 minutes, these cytokines
levels were significantly increased in the IR and the IR-A400 groups (p<0.05 as compared
with baseline). The elevation of these cytokines were attenuated by AZA 400 mg/kg BW
Fig 6. AZA attenuated lung injury. The sham (A) and sham-A200 (B) groups had normal histology while the IR (C) and IR-A100 (D) groups showed
prominent neutrophilic sequestration, inter-alveolar septum thickening and pulmonary edema. IR-induced neutrophilic sequestration, inter-alveolar
septum thickening and pulmonary edema were markedly attenuated by AZA 200 mg/kg BW (E) and 400 mg/kg BW (F).

(p<0.05 as compared between the IR and the IR A400 groups). Notably, the sham group also
demonstrated a mild increase in expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines over the duration
of the experiment (p<0.05 as compared with baseline). However, the elevation of cytokines
were significant less than the IR group at post-reperfusion 90 minutes(p< 0.05 as compared

mRNA expression of carbonic anhydrase II (Fig 11)
Low expression of carbonic anhydrase II mRNA (Fig 11) was detected in the sham group.
However, in the IR group, higher expression of carbonic anhydrase II was found (p<0.05 as
compared between the sham and the IR group). Administration of AZA 400mg/kg BW signifi￾cantly decreased the expression of carbonic anhydrase II mRNA (p<0.05 as compared
between the IR and the IR-A400 group).

Expression of membranous Na,K-ATPase α1 in lung tissues
Resperentative (Fig 14A) and quantitative analyses (Fig 14B) of Na-K-ATPase α1 of the sham,
IR and IR-AZA 400 groups are shown in Fig 13. Expression of Na-K-ATPase α1was higher in
the sham group than in the IR group. However, administration of AZA restored expression of
Na-K-ATPase α1 to baseline levels.
Discussion
The current study revealed that IR-induced ALI caused increased pulmonary micro-vascular
permeability, pulmonary edema, pulmonary hypertension, neutrophilic sequestration, and
pro-inflammatory cytokines. IR also presented with an increase in expression and activity of
carbonic anhydrase, higher pCO2 and a decrease expression of Na,K-ATPase. AZA inhibited
expression and activity of carbonic anhydrase, lowered pCO2 level and restored expression of
Na,K-ATPase. Consequently, treatment with AZA significantly attenuated IR-induced lung
injury with decreased pulmonary micro-vascular permeability, lung inflammation, pulmonary
edema, and pulmonary hypertension.
To our knowledge, this is the first study of AZA treatment for IR-induced ALI. There were
a few studies on AZA in IR in other organs. Bejaoui et al. found that AZA protected liver grafts
against IR injury[17]; Lin and colleagues suggested that AZA decreased infarct size in cardiac IR
[18]; An et al. demonstrated that AZA exerted a reno-protective role against I/R-induced acute
renal injury[19]. In another study, researchers investigated the role of AZA in intracerebral hem￾orrhage(ICH)-induced brain injury in rats[20]. They found AZA was able to reduce ICH-induced
brain edema and neuronal deaths. Based on these studies, it is reasonable to assert that AZA is
capable of producing protective effects against IR injuries in many organs. In the present study,
we further addressed that AZA was beneficial in treating IR-induced lung injury as well.

The pathogenesis of IR-induced ALI involves several biochemical, cellular, and molecular
alterations[21]. Depletion of cellular energy and the accumulation of toxic oxygen metabolites
contribute to ischemic lung injury[21]. Tissue damage is exacerbated at the moment of

reperfusion, and is considered more harmful than ischemia alone[21]. Reperfusion related
injury is directly related to the formation of reactive oxygen species, endothelial cell injury,
increased vascular permeability, and activation of neutrophils, cytokines, and complement sys￾tem[21]. The present study demonstrated the protective effects of AZA via regulation of CO2
levels and inflammation after IR.
During ischemia, O2 delivery is stopped, and the cells convert to anaerobic metabolism,
which produces lactic acid, protons and other toxic byproducts. Protons buffered by HCO3
-
form CO2 in the tissues[22]. In the present study, pCO2 was increased after ischemia, indicat￾ing that increased CO2 production happens during anaerobic metabolism.
In the current study, increased activity and expression of carbonic anhydrase were noted
after IR. Carbonic anhydrase accelerates the conversion of H2CO3
-
to CO2 in the lungs[23].

Therefore, higher CO2 level was found in the IR group. Higher CO2 level contributed to fur￾ther deterioration of alveolar epithelial function and impairment of alveolar fluid absorption
[11]. However, administration of AZA in perfusate inhibited carbonic anhydrase activity[24],
slowed the conversion of HCO3
-
to CO2 and decreasing CO2 levels[8],[24]. Therefore, AZA
has protective effects for lung injury by decreasing CO2 level in lungs.
Intracellular CO2 affects the alveolar epithelial function[11]. Active Na+ transport affects
edema clearance with water following Na+ gradient via apically located sodium channels and
basolaterally-located Na,K-ATPase[25]. Epithelial Na,K-ATPase is a major contributor to alve￾olar fluid reabsorption[25]. Briva et al. found that when alveolar epithelial cells were exposed
to high CO2, the Na,K-ATPase activity is decreased[11]. A decrease in Na,K-ATPase activity
resulted in the inhibition of Na+ transport, with followed by inhibition of alveolar fluid reab￾sorption[26]. High CO2 level triggered endocytosis and inhibition of Na,K-ATPase activity in

alveolar epithelial cells[11], which suggested that elevated CO2 level decreased alveolar fluid
reabsorption[11]. Effros et al. reported similar findings[24] when isolated fluid–filled rat lungs
were perfused with a solution that contained 40 or 60 mmHg CO2,–alveolar fluid reabsorption
was reduced by 50% in hypercapnic conditions [24]. Vadasz et al also foundthat CO2 accumu￾lation resulted in deleterious effects in the lungs[10]. They suggested that elevated CO2 level
caused damage to the epithelial and endothelial barrierand compromised host defense [10].
We found that AZA influenced the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Pulmonary
IR injury involves neutrophils, T cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines[21]. TNF-α is a potent
cytokine released early in response to IR[21] and stimulates neutrophils to release inflamma￾tory mediators leading to further damage[21]. Administration of AZA significantly attenuated
lung inflammation, neutrophils infiltration and expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
These findings suggested that AZA is capable to attenuate IR-induced ALI mediated by an
anti-inflammatory mechanism.

Prior studies have addressed the anti-inflammatory effects of AZA[17, 27]. Wang et al.
found that AZA could decrease pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as monocyte chemoattrac￾tant protein-1, IL-1β, TNF-α and Interferon gamma in rat lung injury of acute mountain sick￾ness[27]. They suggested that AZA protected lung tissue from injury by reducing expression of
pro-inflammatory cytokines[27]. Elevated mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are
found in lung injury[28]. It has been reported that treatment with AZA may cause decreased
expression of MAPKs[17].
IL-17 is expressed by activated T cells[29]. Lymphocytes also play an important role in IR￾induced ALI. In the model of a rat lung transplant[21], it was observed that CD4+ T lympho￾cytes infiltrated the graft after reperfusion[21]. Sharma et al. suggested that CD4+ invariant nat￾ural killer T cells and IL-17 dependent mechanism is important in IR lung injury[29]. IL-17 is
a potent mediator of activation, recruitment and infiltration of neutrophils[29]. In our current
study, expression of IL-17 was increased after IR induction and administration of AZA de￾creased the expression of IL-17. This implies that AZA may also inhibit the pathways of CD4+
T cells and the IL-17 dependent mechanism.
In this study, we noted that the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines was increased in
the sham group. This indicated that the procedures of lung isolation with mechanical ventila￾tion resulted in the elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. However, this degree of elevation
was minimal as compared with the IR group. Veldhuizen et al. showed a similar result[30],
where increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokinesoccurred when the lungs were iso￾lated and ventilated with a tidal volume 7ml/kg[30]. They suggested that this injury was partly
mediated by the surfactant system and the releases of pro-inflammatory cytokines following
mechanical ventilation[30].
Clinical implications
Lungs are vulnerable and IR-induced ALI has beenimplicated in many clinical conditions
such as lung transplantation, pulmonary thrombo-embolectomy, and cardio-pulmonary by￾pass surgery[3–5]. The mortality of IR-induced ALI remains high despite modern medical
managements. Understanding the relationship between carbonic anhydrase and IR-induced
ALI may facilitate development of novel therapeutic interventions.
AZA, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, is an effective drug for the prevention of high-altitude
cerebral edema and management of idiopathic intracranial hypertension and glaucoma[20]. In
the present study, we showed that AZA can attenuate IR-induced ALI. This study may support
the use of AZA in the treatment of IR-induced ALI in the clinical setting.
Limitations of study
The present study revealed a possible, AZA-based therapy for IR-induced ALI. However, there
are still limitations in this study. First, it was performed on animal species with isolated lung
preparations. For the future, studies involving human beings in clinical settings are warranted.
Second, cellular effects of AZA and intracellular CO2 levels are important, but measurement of
intracellular CO2 levels is not possible in the isolated lung model employed in the present
study. Despite this limitation, AZA was still proven to be a beneficial drug for IR-induced lung
injury. Besides, CO2 levels in perfusate was measured, and it was noted that, after IR, pCO2
was lower in the IR-A400 group than in the IR group. In the IR group, higher carbonic anhy￾drase enhances conversion of HCO3
-
to CO2. AZA inhibited carbonic anhydrase and slowed
down the conversion of HCO3
-
into CO2. This result still supported higher CO2 level in the IR
group and higher CO2 impairs alveolar epithelial function. Third, it was interesting to find an
increased expression and activity of carbonic anhydrase after IR. The mechanism underlying

this increase of carbonic anhydrase was unknown. Future studies seeking to confirm this
mechanism are necessary.
Conclusions
The carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, AZA has protective effects on subjects ofIR-induced lung
injury. AZA can decrease expression and activity of carbonic anhydrase, lower pCO2 level,
restore Na,K-ATPase and then attenuate pulmonary microvascular hyper-permeability, pul￾monary edema, pulmonary hypertension, and neutrophilic sequestration in the lungs after IR.
AZA also decreases IR-induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This investigation
provides support for the use of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors in the clinical treatment of IR￾induced ALI. Further investigations are still needed to verify the responses of carbonic anhy￾drase inhibitors in ALI in human beings.
