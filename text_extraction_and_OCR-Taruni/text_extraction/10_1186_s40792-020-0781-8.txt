Abstract
Background: Hepatic artery thrombosis can lead to graft loss associated with severe hepatic infarction or bile duct
ischemia. When anatomical hepatic artery reconstruction is impossible in liver transplantation or hepato-pancreatic
biliary surgery, portal vein arterialization (PVA) is proposed as a salvage technique. Herein, we report our experience
with a case that showed favorable clinical outcomes after partial PVA during living-donor liver transplantation
(LDLT) because of difficulties in arterial reconstruction.
Case presentation: A 62-year-old woman with non-B, non-C liver cirrhosis complicated with hepatocellular carcinoma was
being prepared for LDLT using an extended left lobe graft. The graft presented with two arteries (left hepatic artery, 2 mm;
middle hepatic artery, 2 mm). The first anastomosis was performed using the recipient hepatic artery stumps, but no flow
was detected on Doppler control because of thrombus formation. The next attempt was executed using the middle colic
artery with a radial artery jump graft and the right gastroepiploic artery, but it led to the same result. Thus, the graft oxygen
support by the standard arterial procurement was abandoned, and a shunt was created between the ileocecal artery and
the vein to obtain PVA. Arteriography of the superior mesenteric artery showed that the shunt was relatively patent, and the
portal vein was apparent. No biliary complication or liver abscess occurred postoperatively, and the patient presented with
good liver function and no complications related to portal vein hypertension, nor liver fibrosis 18 months after the LDLT.
Conclusion: Partial PVA with a shunt created between the ileocecal artery and the vein is useful when arterial reconstruction
is difficult during LDLT for preventing graft loss caused by severe hepatic infarction or bile duct ischemia.

Introduction
In liver transplantation, restoration of oxygenated blood sup￾ply to the liver allograft is necessary, considering that all col￾lateral sources of arterial inflow (interlobar hepatic arteries,
peribiliary plexus, and collaterals in triangular ligaments and
lesser omentum) are completely interrupted during graft har￾vest [1]. Thus, when anatomical hepatic artery reconstruction
is impossible, a totally de-arterialized liver may occur. If the
hepatic artery is not reconstructed, biliary ischemia and ne￾crosis can occur, leading to liver necrosis with fatal liver fail￾ure. Re-transplantation is the standard procedure when
anatomical hepatic artery reconstruction is difficult; however,
re-transplantation is not always possible because of donor
shortage in a country such as Japan.
Nonetheless, portal vein arterialization (PVA) has been
used as a salvage technique in case of difficulties in anatom￾ical hepatic artery reconstruction during liver transplantation
and hepato-pancreatic biliary (HPB) surgery [1–3]. PVA
increases the oxygen saturation of portal vein blood signifi￾cantly, preventing hepatic necrosis and failure and promoting
liver regeneration [1, 4–6]. It also avoids biliary ischemia
through terminal portal vein tributaries anastomosed with
the arterial peribiliary plexus [1, 6].
Herein, we report our experience with a case in which
partial PVA was useful for difficult arterial reconstruc￾tion during a living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT).

Case report
A 62-year-old Japanese female was referred to Nagasaki Uni￾versity Hospital to discuss an LDLT for recurrent hepatocel￾lular carcinoma (HCC) and end-stage liver disease due to
non-B, non-C liver cirrhosis. Two years earlier, she under￾went trans-arterial chemoembolization. During follow-up, her
liver function gradually worsened with refractory ascites. She
then repeatedly received a cell-free and concentrated ascites
reinfusion therapy for severe ascites. A new HCC lesion with
a 1.5-cm nodule located in segment 7 was also detected by
enhanced computed tomography (CT). The Child–Pugh
score was 9 (grade B), and the Model for End-stage Liver Dis￾ease score was 16. Her dismal status indicated LDLT, and
after an appropriate workup, an extended left lobe graft from
her 35-year-old healthy daughter was voluntarily donated.
Preoperative imaging findings of the donor did not exhibit
calcification of the arteries or anatomical variation. Potential
causes of failure of hepatic arterial reconstruction, such as a
median arcuate ligament syndrome, were not present, and
potential vessel injuries by previous trans-arterial chemoem￾bolization had not occurred in the recipient. Donor surgery
was performed without any difficulty in the procurement of
the extended left lobe graft. The graft’s two hepatic arteries—
the left hepatic artery (LHA) and the middle hepatic artery
(MHA)—were anastomosed with the recipient’s counterpart
microscopically, but it led to thrombosis at numerous at￾tempts. After confirming blood flow in the anastomosed hep￾atic artery, we performed duct-to-duct biliary reconstruction.
We noticed afterwards that we could not confirm blood flow
in the hepatic artery with the Doppler US probe. Anastomosis
using the recipient’s middle colic artery to the graft’s LHA
microscopically through a right radial artery jump graft was
attempted with no arterial flow on Doppler control. There￾after, the arterial oxygen supply was abandoned, and an ar￾teriovenous shunt was created between the selected ileocecal
artery and the vein to obtain PVA. We used mesenteric blood
vessels to perform selective portal arterialization, in reference
to Hayashi et al.’s report [2]. Because the operative field of this
procedure was separated from the hepatic hilum, it was easy
to approach not only when we created the partial portal
arterialization but also when we closed the shunt to prevent
symptoms of portal hypertension, after confirmation of collat￾eral arterial blood flow [2]. The mesoileum was opened, and
the selected ileocecal artery and vein were taped (Fig. 1a). The
ileocecal artery was anastomosed to the vein microscopically
in an end-to-side fashion with 9-0 Nylon (Fig. 1b). After anas￾tomosis, ultrasonography confirmed favorable blood flow in
the portal and hepatic veins. Portal vein pressure was not
measured, and we did not perform any modulation intraoper￾atively. The operative time was 1737 min, and the blood loss
was 23,314 g. The time from portal reperfusion to recovery of
arterial oxygenation was 1240 min.
Laboratory analysis revealed that during the period of no
oxygenation after portal reperfusion, the AST level was 100
U/L and the ALT level was 118 U/L; on postoperative day
(POD) 1, these levels were 118 U/L and 89 U/L, respectively;
on POD 2, 72 U/L and 149 U/L, respectively; on POD 3, 71
U/L and 145 U/L, respectively; on POD 4, 108 U/L and 159
U/L, respectively; and on POD 4, 78 U/L and 134 U/L, re￾spectively. After POD 5, both levels decreased gradually. The
patient’s serum total bilirubin levels were elevated on POD 1
but decreased gradually after the LDLT. Angiography of the
superior mesenteric artery was performed on POD 3, show￾ing a patent shunt and a clearly visible portal vein (Fig. 2).
After transplantation, continuous hemodiafiltration was
needed until POD 10 because of preoperative hepatorenal
syndrome. On POD 13, this was switched to hemodialysis,
which was withdrawn on POD 21. The amount of ascites
was not severe after LDLT: approximately 2000 mL on POD
7 and approximately 300 mL on POD 14. We removed the
drainage tube completely on POD 23. We checked portal
flow with the Doppler US probe twice a day for 1 week after
LDLT; however, we could not confirm an arterial waveform
in portal flow, and in fact, we had never seen high flow vol￾ume of the portal vein on US study. Thereafter, the patient’s
postoperative course was uneventful. On POD 67, she was
discharged. During postoperative month (POM) 3, a CT scan
was performed, showing that the portal vein was enhanced
through the ileal arteriovenous shunt at the arterial phase
(Fig. 3a). Then, during POM 12, another CT scan was per￾formed, revealing that a thin hepatic artery, which might in￾dicate improved arterialization through biliary anastomosis
or via intrahepatic biliary plexus, was visible during the early
arterial contrast phase (Fig. 3b). On the late arterial phase,
the portal vein was enhanced through the ileal arteriovenous
shunt (Fig. 3c). We measured the patient’s spleen volume
with a three-dimensional image analysis system (SYNAPSE
VINCENT; Fujifilm Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) before sur￾gery, on POD 7, and during POM 1, POM 3, and POM 12.
The spleen volume was 292 mL preoperatively, 386 mL on
POD 7, 337 mL during POM 1, 339 mL during POM 3, and
261 mL during POM 12. The patient’s spleen volume was el￾evated on POD 7 but decreased gradually after the LDLT.
During POM 12, we confirmed, with upper gastrointestinal
endoscopy, that the esophageal varices had not progressed.
No signs of portal hypertension, progression of esophageal
varices, hepatic abscess, biliary complication, or fibrosis were
noted after 18 months of follow-up. One year after the
LDLT, no ischemic change of the bile duct, biliary necrosis,
inflammation around the portal tract, or acute cellular rejec￾tion was detected on liver biopsy.
Discussion
The liver receives dual blood supply from the portal vein and
the hepatic artery. However, if the hepatic artery is inter￾rupted, the blood flow and oxygen supply decrease, causing
biliary ischemia, liver necrosis, and fatal liver failure. Never￾theless, ischemic cholangitis and bile duct necrosis do not

occur in all patients with a de-arterialized liver because of
the heterogeneous rapid development of collaterals after
complete interruption of the hepatic artery in general and
HPB surgery. Considering the complete interruption of all
collateral sources of arterial inflow (interlobar hepatic arter￾ies, peribiliary plexus, and collaterals in triangular ligaments
and lesser omentum) during liver transplantation,
oxygenated blood supply to the liver allograft by the hepatic
artery is necessary. The hepatic artery plays a vital role after
liver transplantation, especially after LDLT, providing blood
for both the liver parenchyma and bile duct. Thus, if anatom￾ical hepatic artery reconstruction is impossible during liver
transplantation, a totally de-arterialized liver may occur.
Eventually, biliary ischemia and necrosis take place, thereby
possibly leading to liver necrosis and fatal liver failure. PVA,
which allows arterial blood to flow into the portal vein, is an
emergency salvage surgical procedure for cases wherein
reconstructing the hepatic artery is difficult during liver
transplantation and HPB surgery.
Iseki et al. studied human PVA in a de-arterialized liver of
a patient in whom hepatic artery ligation following arterial
rupture and hemorrhage after Whipple procedure was re￾quired [4]. Subsequently, the use of PVA has been reported
in liver transplantation and in HPB surgery primarily for hep￾atic artery thrombosis (HAT) [6–10]. PVA is temporarily
effective in preventing premature graft failure. However, the
incidence rate of portal hypertension is approximately 44%,
and it is more common within 1 year, including the portal
arterialization cases of postoperative HAT [1]. Strict blood
pressure control and shunt blood flow closure are needed,
and careful consideration should be applied before
selecting this modality of liver oxygenated blood sup￾ply restoration [1, 10].
According to some authors, calibrating the arterial inflow is
important for preventing portal hypertension after PV [1, 9,
11]. Hayashi et al. reported that the portal pressure after con￾structing a partial PVA with a mesenteric arteriovenous shunt
could be slight because the arterial flow into the portal vein is
not excessive [2]. In our case, the patient presented with good
liver function tests and no complications related to portal vein
hypertension, nor liver fibrosis on POM 18. The reasons why
complications related to portal vein hypertension did not

occur in our case might be the construction of a partial PVA
using a mesenteric arteriovenous shunt and the buffering ef￾fect of a liver graft from a young donor. However, if such
complications shall occur, shunt closure or embolization
might need to be considered.
Conclusion
In conclusion, PVA with a shunt created between the ileo￾cecal artery and the vein is useful in case of difficult arter￾ial reconstruction during LDLT for preventing graft loss
caused by severe hepatic infarction or bile duct ischemia.
