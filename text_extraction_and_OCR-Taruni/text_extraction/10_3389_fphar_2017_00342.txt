In patients undergoing solid organ transplantation, the presence of an interleukin-1
(IL-1) driven disease may require the addition of IL-1 inhibiting drugs to the standard
immunosuppressive regimen to protect against inflammation and negative graft
outcome. Three patients undergoing renal transplantation were treated perioperatively
with the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist anakinra. Kidney function increased rapidly
in all three and the only complications seen were minor infections. In vitro studies
report associations between serum and urinary levels of IL-1β and IL-1 receptor
antagonist and negative graft outcome, and studies in animals and two small human trials
illustrate a possible protective effect of anti-IL-1 therapy after solid organ transplantation.
Peri- and postoperative use of anakinra is safe and effective in patients undergoing renal
transplantation.

INTRODUCTION
Patients undergoing solid organ transplantation depend on life-long immunosuppressive therapy
with T-cel inhibiting drugs to prevent allograft rejection. In patients suffering from an interleukin￾1 (IL-1) driven inflammatory disease, continuation of IL-1 inhibition is important because
inflammation in these diseases is not controlled by the standard immunosuppressive drugs used
after renal transplantation, and when anti-IL-1 directed therapy is stopped these patients are at high
risk of recurrence of inflammation, associated with severe symptoms, such as arthritis, peritonitis,
meningitis and many others.
IL-1 is a potent proinflammatory cytokine, which actions are mitigated by the circulating IL-1
receptor antagonist (IL-1RA). The recombinant IL-1RA anakinra is a very effective treatment for
IL-1 driven diseases, such as autoinflammatory diseases and rheumatoid arthritis.
Little is known on the effects of perioperative IL-1 inhibition during renal transplantation.
Hypothetically, the additional immunosuppressive effect of anti-IL-1 treatment on top of
the standard immunosuppressive regimen could increase the risk of complications, especially

infections. On the other hand, cessation of anti-IL-1 therapy
in IL-1 driven diseases may lead to recurrence of systemic
inflammation, which may negatively influence short- and long￾term transplant function and in some diseases may increases the
risk of amyloidosis in the allograft.
We have recently performed renal transplantation in three
patients with IL-1 driven diseases while continuing anti￾IL-1 therapy with anakinra before, during and after the
transplantation1

CASE SERIES
Case 1
A now 70-year old man developed recurrent fever episodes 12
years ago. One year after the first fever attack he developed
end-stage renal disease. Renal biopsy at that time showed
thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). He was temporarily treated
with plasmapheresis and was started on hemodialysis, which
was later switched to peritoneal dialysis. After multiple episodes
of fever and polyarthritis he was diagnosed with adult onset
Still’s disease (AOSD) and treatment with anakinra 100 mg on
alternating days was started, which was later increased to the
standard dose of 100 mg daily when renal function spontaneously
increased. Four years after anakinra was started, this patient
received a renal transplantation from a living related donor. He
was started on immunosuppressive therapy with mycophenolate
mofetil (MMF), tacrolimus and prednisone. Anakinra 100 mg
daily was continued without interruption, only a single dose
was skipped at the day of transplantation. After transplantation,
kidney function improved rapidly and he could be discharged
from the hospital 7 days postoperative. In the first year after
the transplantation he experienced only two minor infections:
an abscess located at an old drain entry site was drained 2
months after the transplantation and he was admitted for 5
days 6 months after the transplantation because of an upper
respiratory tract infection. During these episodes anakinra and
other immunosuppressive drugs were continued. 14 months
after the transplantation this patient has been admitted for 34
days, and again 7 months later for 11 days, including several
days in the intensive care unit, because of fever, encephalopathy
and renal failure. These episodes were caused by exacerbations
of the underlying AOSD. Two consecutive kidney biopsies
showed endo- and extracapillary glomerulonephritis without
signs of rejection or TMA. Treatment with high-dose steroids
led to recovery of kidney function. Because of these severe
exacerbations and apparent anakinra failure, anakinra was
switched to the anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab.
The transplantation is now 2.5 years ago and this patient is doing
well.
Case 2
A now 22-year old woman was diagnosed with mutation negative
cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS)/chronic
infantile neurologic, cutaneous, articular (CINCA) syndrome
1All three patients gave their consent for anonymous publication of their data.
at the age of 10. She had been suffering from rash, chronic
meningitis, bone dysplasia and growth retardation since birth.
From the first year of life recurrent episodes of pyelonephritis
had been present, associated with vesicourethral reflux, leading
to impaired renal function and proteinuria. These had been
progressive since the age of 17.
Directly after she was diagnosed with CAPS, she was started
on anakinra. 8 years later she switched to the selective IL￾1β antibody canakinumab. Two years later she developed
end stage renal disease due to a combination of recurrent
pyelonephritis, use of NSAIDs and hypertension. Kidney biopsy
was contraindicated because of small kidney size, but there
were no other signs of AA amyloidosis. A pre-emptive renal
transplantation was planned and 2 months before, canakinumab
was switched back to anakinra 100 mg on alternating days; the
shorter half life of the latter makes it more easy to stop in case
of complications. This patient received a renal transplantation
of a living related donor almost 2 years ago. She was started
on immunosuppressive therapy with MMF, tacrolimus and
prednisone, while anakinra was continued. Kidney function
increased rapidly and she could be discharged 6 days after the
transplantation. Because of incomplete control of inflammation
4 months after the transplantation the dose of anakinra was
increased stepwise to 100 mg each 36 h and later to 100 mg daily.
She is now doing well. She has been admitted three times since
the transplantation: 3 months post-transplantation because of
influenza and primo-Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infection (2 days)
and both 8 and 11 months after the transplantation because of
diarrhea, with positive norovirus PCR during the last episode.
This may be related to her job at a children’s day care center.
MMF was switched to azathioprine because of diarrhea. She still
uses anakinra 100 mg each day.
Case 3
A 29-year old Turkish man was known with familial
Mediterranean fever (FMF) since the age of 6 and slowly
progressive nephrotic syndrome due to AA amyloidosis, which
had been proven in a rectal biopsy at the age of 17. He had been
on colchicine treatment since diagnosis, but without complete
compliance and without proper medical guidance. He was only
referred to a tertiary treatment center 11 years after the diagnosis
of amyloidosis because of further deterioration of renal function
after a pneumonia associated with vomiting and diarrhea with
persistent use of ACE-inhibitors and NSAIDs. Hemodialysis had
been initiated 1 month before referral. Renal biopsy at the time
of referral showed AA amyloidosis. Because of unsatisfactory
inflammatory control on colchicine, anakinra 100 mg on
alternating days was started. This resulted in rapid control of
inflammation. 15 months later he received a renal transplant
from a living related donor. While continuing anakinra, he was
started on standard immunosuppressive therapy with MMF,
tacrolimus and prednisone. Renal function increased rapidly,
but 4 days after the transplantation he developed a typical FMF￾attack with fever, headache and malaise. The dose of anakinra
was increased to 100 mg daily, because of suspected decreased
plasma levels of anakinra due to increased renal clearance. This
resulted in prompt resolution of symptoms. He was discharged

9 days after the transplantation. He is now 10 months after the
transplantation. He has been admitted only once for 2 days 3
months after the transplantation because of pneumonia.
Six months after the transplantation, MMF has been switched
to azathioprine on patient’s request to simplify the drug regimen.
He is doing well, has normal kidney function and still uses
anakinra 100 mg daily.
DISCUSSION AND LITERATURE REVIEW
IL-1 Inhibition during and after Organ
Transplantation in Patients with IL-1 Driven
Inflammatory Diseases
In three patients who underwent renal transplantation, the use
of the IL-1RA anakinra in combination with MMF/azathioprine,
tacrolimus and prednisone was safe and well tolerated. Few
complications were seen; all were minor infections, which are
common in renal transplant patients. Kidney function increased
rapidly in all three patients and no drug-drug interactions were
observed.
The only other patients undergoing renal transplantation with
perioperative anakinra treatment reported in literature are two
FMF patients described in a case report (Moser et al., 2009) and a
case series (Ozcakar et al., 2016). Both had end stage renal failure
due to AA amyloidosis. No complications were observed in either
patient. Ozcakar et al. continued anakinra perioperatively, while
it is unclear from the report of Moser et al. how they handled
the drug in the perioperative period. In our three cases, we only
skipped a single dose of anakinra on the day of transplantation.
These scarce cases on continuing anakinra perioperatively in
renal transplantation patients give an indication that it can
be safely combined with immunosuppressants used to prevent
allograft rejection.
There are several reports on the safety of anakinra when
initiated after renal transplantation and other solid organ
transplantations in patients with IL-1 driven diseases. A number
of case reports and two case series describe 5 adults and
adolescents with FMF and one adult with CAPS that were started
on anakinra in combination with azathioprine or tacrolimus
and prednisone 1–3 years after renal transplantation. All report
no complications and good graft function (Leslie et al., 2006;
Alpay et al., 2012; Celebi et al., 2014; Ozcakar et al., 2016).
A seventh renal transplant patient treated with tacrolimus
developed neutropenia 2 months after anakinra was started
because of gout. The start of anakinra was also associated with
decreased allograft function. It could be debated whether this
really can be attributed to anakinra as this patient was 20
years post-transplantation and already known with chronic graft
dysfunction (Direz et al., 2012).
All our patients received an allograft from a living related
donor. Of the other reported patients that underwent renal
transplantation during or after the initiation of anakinra, donor
type was reported in only two: one patient that started anakinra
after renal transplantation received a kidney from a living related
donor (Leslie et al., 2006), while the other received an allograft
from a deceased donor 5 months after the initiation of anakinra
(Moser et al., 2009). In this latter patient, the immunsuppressive
drug regimen post-transplantation was the same as in the cases
described here (tacrolimus, MMF and prednisone) and there was
immediate graft function (Moser et al., 2009).
Anakinra was also reported to be safe after liver
transplantation and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
in one patient each (Petropoulou et al., 2010; Yilmaz et al.,
2014). In all patients anakinra effectively reduced inflammation,
reflected by rapid resolution of symptoms and decrease of serum
inflammatory markers.
Our third case and a patient reported by Moser et al.
(2009) illustrate that, equal to the need for dose adjustment
in patients with impaired renal function, it is important to
increase the dose of anakinra when renal function increases
after renal transplantation to avoid recurrence of inflammation.
Increased renal clearance of anakinra results in decreased anti￾inflammatory effect. When decreased renal function was present,
the patients reported here were treated with anakinra 100 mg
every 36–48 h, depending on the severity of renal function loss,
instead of the standard dose of 100 mg daily.
IL-1 Inhibition after Organ Transplantation
in Humans or Animals in the Absence of an
Inflammatory Disease
In pancreatic islet transplantation, treatment with IL-1RA in apes
(Danobeitia et al., 2015) or mice (Sahraoui et al., 2014) increased
engraftment and efficacy of treatment. In mice undergoing
pancreatic islet transplantation, treatment with IL-1RA gene
therapy also led to better engraftment(Hsu et al., 2009) In
humans, two trials including a total of 14 patients with type 1
diabetes mellitus, showed that treatment with anakinra during
the first 1–2 weeks after the transplantation in combination
with anti-thyomocyte globulin (ATG) and prednisone or
etanercept/tacrolimus/MMF led to better engraftment and did
not lead to increased risk of infections (Takita et al., 2012; Maffi
et al., 2014).
In mice and rats undergoing high risk cornea transplantation,
topical treatment with IL-1RA (Dana et al., 1997; Yamada et al.,
1998; Dekaris et al., 1999; Jie et al., 2004a,b; Dana, 2007) or IL￾1RA gene therapy (Yuan et al., 2012) reduced the incidence of
graft dysfunction.
The Role of IL-1 in Renal Transplantation
In case of renal transplantation in patients with IL-1 related
inflammatory disorders, inhibition of the increased IL-1
signaling is necessary to suppress the symptoms due to the
inflammatory disease. It could be hypothesized that suppression
of inflammation could also benefit the renal allograft, as the
risk of possible impaired graft function or allograft rejection
due to increased IL-1 serum levels may be important after
transplantation. Studies on this subject show an association
between increased IL-1 signaling and negative graft outcome.
In rats, during acute renal allograft rejection IL-1 mRNA
is upregulated in kidney and spleen (Nagano et al., 1997) and
IL-1 expression is upregulated in mononuclear, mesangial and
endothelial cells in the graft (Tilney et al., 1993).
Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org 3 May 2017 | Volume 8 | Article 342

Mulders-Manders et al. IL-1-Inhibitors during Renal Transplantation
In humans, polymorphonuclear cells (PBMCs) (De Serres
et al., 2011, 2012; Batal et al., 2014) and monocytes (Weimer
et al., 2003) of patients with chronic rejection, glomerulonephritis
or tubulopathy secrete more IL-1β than cells derived from non￾rejecting patients or patients with normal renal graft biopsies.
In patients with chronic renal graft dysfunction, the expression
of IL-1β mRNA in the arterial wall of the renal arteries is
upregulated (Zegarska et al., 2002).
Patients with acute renal allograft rejection have increased
urinary excretion of IL-1β (Teppo et al., 1998). A single study
showed higher serum IL-1β levels in patients with decreased graft
function after transplantation (Caban et al., 2009) compared to
patients with immediate graft function, although it has to be kept
in mind that the concentration of circulating IL-1β and IL-1RA
does not directly reflect the level of inflammation in vivo.
Polymorphisms in the genes encoding IL-1α, -β, and IL-1RA
in renal transplant recipients are presumed to be associated with
acute rejection (Manchanda et al., 2006; Manchanda and Mittal,
2008), short-term (Manchanda et al., 2006), and long-term graft
function (Haldar et al., 1999), but this has not been reproduced
in other studies (Marshall et al., 2000; Lee et al., 2004; Uboldi
de Capei et al., 2004; Seyhun et al., 2012). This is most likely
due to too small cohort sizes, differences in patient selection and
case definition. Donor genotype does not influence graft outcome
(Marshall et al., 2001).
Studies on the role of IL-1RA after renal transplantation show
a protective effect. Low serum IL-1RA after transplantation is
associated with delayed graft function (Sadeghi et al., 2003).
Right before and during acute rejection, urinary excretion of IL￾1RA was found to be decreased in some (Teppo et al., 1998,
2001; Xu et al., 2013), but not all studies (Sadeghi et al., 2003;
Reinhold et al., 2012). These contradictory results may arise
due to differences in patient selection, living or postmortal
donors, immunosuppresive drug regimens, definition of allograft
rejection, interval between transplant and rejection, or the
cytokine measurement methods used. Higher urinary IL-1RA
excretion is associated with better 1-year renal allograft function
(Pereira et al., 2012) and the production of IL-1RA in renal
biopsies taken before and during rejection is decreased compared
to biopsies of non-rejecting kidneys (Oliveira et al., 1997; de
Oliveira et al., 2002).
Renal transplantation is accompanied by ischemia￾reperfusion injury, which may lead to delayed and impaired
graft function. IL-1 is released during early reperfusion and
induces apoptosis and an inflammatory response. There are few
studies on the protective effects of IL-1RA in renal ischemia￾reperfusion injury. During experimental ischemic clamping of
murine native kidneys, one study showed that intraperitoneal
treatment with a very high dose of IL-1RA (80 mg/kg) leads
to significant reduction of tubular necrosis 24 h–5 days after
ischemia-reperfusion and less apoptosis after 5 days (Rusai et al.,
2008), but this has not been reproduced (Daemen et al., 2001),
probably because of differences in the IL-1RA dose used and the
methods used to detect ischemia-reperfusion injury. In a cardiac
ischemia-reperfusion model in rabbits, intraventricular injection
of 10–40 mg/kg IL-1RA after experimental myocardial ischemia
decreased myocardial apoptosis (Li et al., 2004).
There are no studies on the effects of IL-RA treatment
on reperfusion-ischemia injury in humans, and as the Il￾1RA doses used in mice are high (approximately 4–300 mg/kg,
compared to 2 mg/kg in children and a total of 100 mg in
patients >40 kg in humans) these results cannot be directly
extrapolated to a possible protective effect in humans. There are
no reports on worse graft outcome after organ transplantation
in patients with IL-1 driven inflammatory diseases, but as
the number of patients with these kinds of diseases is
limited, this might not be clinically evident. All three patients
reported here had immediate graft function and no signs of
rejection.
Besides possible worse graft outcome due to rejection
or reperfusion-ischemia injury, the occurrence of
secondary AA amyloidosis with consequent long-term
graft loss due to prolonged uncontrolled inflammation
in some IL-1 driven diseases is an additional reason why
continuation of IL-1 inhibition after renal transplantation
is important in patients with these diseases. Adequate
inflammatory control protects against the development of AA
amyloidosis.
CONCLUSION
In our three patients that used IL-1 inhibitors before, during
and after renal transplantation, continuing the IL-1 receptor
antagonist anakinra on top of the standard immunosuppressive
drug regimen with MMF, tacrolimus and prednisone was safe
and well tolerated. Before and after transplantation the dose
of anakinra should be adjusted to the renal function, as this
influences clearance.
