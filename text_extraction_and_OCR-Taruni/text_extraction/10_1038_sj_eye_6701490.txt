Abstract
Purpose
To evaluate the outcome of fresh amniotic membrane
transplantation (AMT) for ocular surface reconstruction in acute
chemical burns.
Methods
A prospective study of 15 consecutive eyes with acute chemical
burns was performed. In all, 10 eyes had lime burns and five eyes
had acid burns. There were three eyes of grade II, four eyes of grade
III and eight eyes of grade IV burns. AMT was performed within 3
weeks of injury.
Results
Patients were followed up for 10.14±4.41 months. All patients had
immediate relief of pain postoperatively. Of 15 eyes, nine (60%)


showed epithelialization within 1–4 weeks (15.33±9.91 days). The
final visual acuity improved in 10 of 15 eyes (66.66%). Eyes with
burns of grade II and III showed more visual improvement than
those with grade IV burns. None of the eyes showed perforation.
Symblepharon was seen in nine of 15 eyes (60%). Of 15 eyes, 12
(80%) experienced limbal stem cell deficiency and showed
superficial corneal vascularization.
Conclusions
Amniotic membrane transplantation with fresh amniotic membrane
increases patient comfort and reduces inflammation. In mild burns,
AMT alone restores corneal and conjunctival surfaces. In moderate
to severe burns, it probably reduces conjunctival scarring sequelae,
but does not prevent the sequelae of limbal stem cell deficiency that
requires further limbal stem cell transplantation. In the acute stage,
amniotic membrane transplantation probably has a protective role
against the progressive melting and perforation.
