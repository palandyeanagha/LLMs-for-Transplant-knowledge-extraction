Abstract
Background: The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of abnormal urine analysis and kidney dysfunction in
COVID-19 patients and to determine the association of acute kidney injury (AKI) with the severity and prognosis of
COVID-19 patients.
Methods: The electronic database of Embase and PubMed were searched for relevant studies. A meta-analysis of
eligible studies that reported the prevalence of abnormal urine analysis and kidney dysfunction in COVID-19 was
performed. The incidences of AKI were compared between severe versus non-severe patients and survivors versus
non-survivors.
Results: A total of 24 studies involving 4963 confirmed COVID-19 patients were included. The proportions of
patients with elevation of sCr and BUN levels were 9.6% (95% CI 5.7–13.5%) and 13.7% (95% CI 5.5–21.9%),
respectively. Of all patients, 57.2% (95% CI 40.6–73.8%) had proteinuria, 38.8% (95% CI 26.3–51.3%) had proteinuria
+, and 10.6% (95% CI 7.9–13.3%) had proteinuria ++ or +++. The overall incidence of AKI in all COVID-19 patients
was 4.5% (95% CI 3.0–6.0%), while the incidence of AKI was 1.3% (95% CI 0.2–2.4%), 2.8% (95% CI 1.4–4.2%), and
36.4% (95% CI 14.6–58.3%) in mild or moderate cases, severe cases, and critical cases, respectively. Meanwhile, the
incidence of AKI was 52.9%(95% CI 34.5–71.4%), 0.7% (95% CI − 0.3–1.8%) in non-survivors and survivors,
respectively. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was required in 5.6% (95% CI 2.6–8.6%) severe patients,
0.1% (95% CI − 0.1–0.2%) non-severe patients and 15.6% (95% CI 10.8–20.5%) non-survivors and 0.4% (95% CI − 0.2–
1.0%) survivors, respectively.
Conclusion: The incidence of abnormal urine analysis and kidney dysfunction in COVID-19 was high and AKI is
closely associated with the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Therefore, it is important to increase
awareness of kidney dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.

Introduction
Previous publications have shown that AKI developed in
5 to 15% cases and carried a high mortality rate (60 to
90%) in SARS and MERS-CoV infections [1]. Recent
studies have reported that acute renal impairment also
occurs in COVID-19 patients. Cheng et al. have shown
that among 710 consecutively hospitalized patients with
COVID-19, 44% had proteinuria and hematuria, and
26.7% had hematuria on admission [2]. The incidence of
elevated sCr and BUN was 15.5% and 14.1%, respectively
[3]. It has also been reported that the incidence rate of
AKI in COVID-19 patients ranged from 0.5 to 29%
dependent on the different severity of the illness. The
AKI incidence was 0.1 to 2% for mild cases, 3–3.2% for
severe cases, and up to 8.3–29% for critically ill patients
that need to be admitted into the ICU [4–13].
In order to fully understand the prevalence and the
clinical characteristics of kidney impairment in COVID￾19 patients, we have provided in this article a systematic
review not only to evaluate the prevalence of acute renal
impairment, but also to assess the risk of AKI in severely
ill patients and non-survivors compared to non-severely
ill patients and survivors, respectively. The findings in
this article will help the clinicians to increase awareness
of kidney impairment in COVID-19 patients.
Methods
Data source, search strategy, and exclusion criteria
We conducted a systematic search on PubMed and
Embase from December 2019 to May 2020 and have
used terms “COVID-19” and “novel coronavirus” in
combination with terms including “clinical characteris￾tics,” “kidney injury,” and “renal impairment” as key￾words for literature search. The exclusion criteria
included [1] studies that duplicate [2], studies on sample
size smaller than 10 [3], studies that do not provide
useful clinical characteristics or kidney impairment indi￾cators [4], case reports, reviews or editorials [5], only
children cases and family-based studies, and [6] studies
written in Chinese (for the fear of data duplication). The
literature search is shown step by step with a flow chart
(Fig. 1). Two investigators worked independently to
decide which studies should be included, and the
disagreement was resolved by a third investigator.

Data extraction
After literature retrieval, we extracted the following
parameters from 24 articles: sCr, BUN, elevation of
sCr, elevation of BUN, incidence of AKI, proteinuria,
proteinuria +, proteinuria ++/+++, the incidence of
AKI in severely (including severe cases and critical
cases) and non-severely (including mild and moderate
cases) ill patients, the incidence of AKI in survivors
and non-survivors, application of CRRT in severely ill
and non-severely ill patients, and application of CRRT
in survivors and non-survivors. The characteristics of
these studies are shown in Table 1.
Data analysis
All analyses and plots were performed and made with the
R version 3.6.3. For studies that did not provide mean and
standard deviation but provided median (m) and upper
(q3) and lower quartiles (q1) instead, the mean was esti￾mated by (q1 + m + q3)/3, and the standard deviation was
estimated by (q3 − q1)/1.35 [14]. Forest plots were made to
show the estimated mean and 95% confidence interval of
kidney indicators or prevalence and the corresponding 95%
CI of kidney impairment, respectively. The log risk ratios
(log RR and 95% CI) were calculated to illustrate the rela￾tive risk of severe or non-survival patients to show AKI or
to be supported with CRRT compared with non-severe or
survival patients, respectively. The level of heterogeneity is
defined based on the calculated I
2
: an I
2 smaller than 25%
represents insignificant heterogeneity, an I
2 between 25%
and 50% represents low heterogeneity, an I
2 between 50%
and 75% represents moderate heterogeneity, and an I
2
larger than 75% represents high heterogeneity [15]. A fixed
effect model (inverse variance) was used to pool the data if
I
2 < 50%, and a random effect model (DerSimonian-Laird)
was used if I
2 > 50% [16]. The threshold of statistical signifi￾cance in this paper was set to be 0.05.
Results
We initially identified 306 articles based on the search re￾sults, and 102 articles were recognized to be duplicates.

studies included
Yang et al. Critical Care (2020) 24:356 Page 3 of 8

After removing the duplicates, the team members have
carefully reviewed the titles, the abstracts, and the
tables of the remaining 29 articles, and identified 24
articles [4–13, 17–28] that met our selection criteria
and contained the data we need to investigate. These
24 articles were all published in 2020, and a total num￾ber of 4963 patients were included. The sample patient
size of the groups ranged from 12 to 1099, and most of
the studies recruited are based on patients in China,
with three exceptions that focused on patients in the
USA (Table 1).
Meta-analyses of these studies have shown that 9.6%
(95% CI 5.7–13.5%) and 13.7% (95% CI 5.5–21.9%) of
the patients showed an elevation in the sCr level and
BUN level, respectively (Fig. 2). In addition, we have also
conducted meta-analysis on the incidence of proteinuria
of COVID-19 patients. Based on the three studies that
contained data about proteinuria, 57.2% (95% CI 40.6–
73.8%) of all patients had proteinuria, 38.8% (95% CI
26.3–51.3%) of all patients had proteinuria +, and 10.6%
(95% CI 7.9–13.3%) of all patients had proteinuria ++ or
+++ (Fig. 3). Heterogeneity was included in the above￾mentioned kidney impairment indicators except for the
proportion of patients with proteinuria ++ or +++, as
the I
2 indexes were between 69.1 and 96.9%, which were
all above 50%. The I
2 index of 8.40% (P value = 0.30) of
the proteinuria ++ or +++ indicated that homogeneity
was included.
The meta-analysis has shown that 4.5% (95% CI 3.0–
6.0%) of COVID-19 patients had AKI (Fig. 4). The inci￾dence of AKI was 1.3% (95% CI 0.2–2.4%), 2.8% (95% CI
1.4–4.2%), and 36.4% (95% CI 14.6–58.3%) in mild or
moderate cases, severe cases, and critical cases, respect￾ively (Fig. 5). The log risk ratio for severe patients to
develop AKI compared with non-severe patients was
1.81 (95% CI 1.21–2.41, Z = 5.88, P < 0.01, Fig. 4). The
meta-analysis also showed that the incidence of AKI was
52.9%(95% CI 34.5–71.4%) vs 0.7%(95% CI − 0.3–1.8%)
in non-survivors and survivors, respectively (Supplemen￾tary Figure 1). The log risk ratio to develop AKI for
non-survivors compared to the survivors was 2.33 (95%
CI 0.88–3.78, Z = 3.15, P < 0.01, Fig. 4).
Finally, CRRT was used on 5.6% (95% CI 2.6–8.6%)
severe patients, 0.1% (95% CI − 0.1–0.2%) non-severe
patients (Supplementary Figure 2) and 15.6% (95% CI
10.8–20.5%) non-survivors, 0.4%(95% CI − 0.2–1.0%)
survivors (Supplementary Figure 3), showing the log risk
ratio 3.34 (95% CI 1.66–5.02, Z = 3.88, P < 0.01) and 2.83
(95% CI 1.57–4.10, Z = 4.38, P < 0.01), respectively.
(Fig. 6).
Discussion
Our meta-analysis showed that renal impairment in
patients with COVID-19 is common. The manifestations
of kidney damage are diverse, ranging from abnormal
urine analysis, elevated sCr or BUN levels, to AKI and
renal failure for which CRRT is required. Among these
renal impairments, abnormal urine analysis is the most
frequent. 57.2% patients have proteinuria, in which mild
proteinuria (+) as well as moderate or severe proteinuria
(++ to +++) account for 38.8% and 10.6%, respectively.
Cheng’s study has found that compared with patients
without proteinuria, patients with proteinuria+ and ++
to +++ had a 1.5-fold and fivefold increased risk of

death, respectively, indicating that proteinuria is an inde￾pendent risk factor for in-hospital death of COVID-19
patients [2], so more attention should be paid to urine
analysis in clinical practice.
Another main kidney damage manifestation was ele￾vated sCr and BUN levels with incidence rate of 9.6 and
13.7%, respectively. Elevated sCr and BUN levels may be
due to chronic kidney disease or AKI. Cheng’s study
showed that the baseline sCr was elevated in 15.5%
COVID-19 patients on admission; patients with elevated
baseline of sCr were more likely to develop AKI and more
severe AKI. Meanwhile, elevated baseline sCr and BUN
levels was an independent risk factor for hospital mortality
[2]. Therefore, we should increase more awareness to
COVID-19 patients who had elevated baseline sCr.
Our meta-analysis showed that the averaged inci￾dence of AKI was 4.5%, ranging from 1.3 to 36.4%
dependent on the different severity of the illness. The
exact pathogenesis of COVID-19-associated AKI is
unclear. Based on the results of our meta-analysis in
combination with our frontline experience, we con￾sider that the etiology of renal impairment is likely to
be diverse and multifactorial. Besides the direct attack
by the SARS-CoV-2, hypoxia and hypercoagulability
also contribute to kidney damage.
It has been reported that in the kidney, angiotensin￾converting enzyme2 (ACE2) is highly expressed in the
brush border of proximal tubular cells but not in glomeru￾lar endothelial and mesangial cells [29], which could
explain the fact that the main feature of kidney injury is
the damage of renal tubules. Zhong’s team in Guangzhou
has also successfully isolated SARS-CoV-2 from the urine
sample of an infected patient [30]. It also has been found
in the kidney biopsy that SARS-CoV-2 antigens accumu￾lated in kidney tubules in situ [31, 32]. These evidences
supported the notion that SARS-CoV-2 can directly attack
human kidney. In addition, COVID-19 patients exhibit
obvious hypoxia symptoms and renal tubules are more
susceptible to ischemia and hypoxia compared to glom￾eruli. Moreover, COVID-19 patients mainly showed
hypercoagulant states with elevated levels of D-dimer,
leading to the slow blood flow velocity in the capillaries
around the renal tubules and increased risk of micro￾thrombus formation as confirmed by autopsy results [33].
In contrast to the previous study showing that median
time for the occurrence of AKI from symptom onset

were 20 and 16 days in SARS and MERS patients, respect￾ively [1], Cheng et al. have found that AKI developed 6 days
after admission in most COVID-19 patients while only 2
days after admission in patients with elevated baseline of
sCr [2]. Our meta-analysis also revealed that the incidence
of AKI was more than fivefold higher in severe cases and
non-survivors than that in non-severe cases and survivors.
Since severe COVID-19 is commonly complicated with
ARDS which has high demand for fluid management,
optimizing fluid volume and maintaining hemodynamic
stability are crucial to prevent the occurrence or progres￾sion of AKI. In addition, appropriate anticoagulant therapy
might help to reduce the microthrombus formation and to
alleviate renal injury.
Our meta-analysis also showed 15.6% non-survivors
received CRRT, while 0.4% survivors needed CRRT,
which indicated that COVID-19 patients complicated
with AKI have a poor prognosis once CRRT is applied.
As existing studies have not provided detailed informa￾tion about survivors and non-survivors experiencing
CRRT, further research is needed to determine whether
early renal replacement therapy could improve the prog￾nosis of COVID-19 patients complicated with AKI.
Study limitations
The number of studies included was limited in terms of
sample size, data availability, and methodologic quality,
as most of the patients were from China. It will be better
to include more studies with a broad geographic scope,
to get a more comprehensive understanding of acute
renal impairment in COVID-19. In addition, more
detailed patient information, particularly regarding the

risk of AKI and the relationship of comorbidities with
AKI, was not available in most studies at the time of
analyses. Another limitation of this study is that some
articles have provided median and interquartile ranges
but not mean and standard deviation of the sCr and
BUN values. The mean and standard deviation for those
data has been estimated in this study based on the
median and the interquartile range, which might lead to
inaccuracy to some extent.
Conclusion
Although ARDS was the main feature of COVID-19, our
meta-analysis identified the high prevalence of abnormal
urine analysis and kidney dysfunction in COVID-19
patients. The overall incidence of AKI in COVID-19 pa￾tients was 3.7%, and the degree of AKI is closely associated
with the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 patients.
We consider renal tubule as the main part of injury in
COVID-19 patients and the etiology of renal impairment
in COVID-19 patients is likely to be diverse and multi￾factorial. Apart from direct attack by the SARS-CoV-2,
hypoxia and hypercoagulability may also contribute to
the occurrence of renal injury.
Our findings indicate that it is important to increase
awareness of kidney impairment in COVID-19 patients.
Screening of the urine analysis, more frequent measurement
of sCr, optimization of fluid volume, and appropriate anti￾coagulant therapy during the management of COVID-19
are essential.
