Abstract
Cardiac rhabdomyomas are benign cardiac tumours with few
cardiac complications, but with a known association to tuberous
sclerosis that affects the neurologic outcome of the patients. We
have analysed the long-term cardiac and neurological outcomes of
patients with cardiac rhabdomyomas in order to allow
comprehensive prenatal counselling, basing our findings on the
records of all patients seen prenatally and postnatally with an


echocardiographic diagnosis of cardiac rhabdomyoma encountered
from August, 1982, to September, 2007. We analysed factors such
as the number and the location of the tumours to establish their
association with a diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis, predicting the
cardiac and neurologic outcomes for the patients.
Cardiac complications include arrhythmias, obstruction of the
ventricular outflow tracts, and secondary cardiogenic shock.
Arrhythmias were encountered most often during the neonatal
period, with supraventricular tachycardia being the commonest
rhythm disturbance identified. No specific dimension or location of
the cardiac rhabdomyomas predicted the disturbances of rhythm.
The importance of the diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis is exemplified
by the neurodevelopmental complications, with four-fifths of the
patients showing epilepsy, and two-thirds having delayed
development. The presence of multiple cardiac tumours suggested a
higher risk of being affected by tuberous sclerosis. The tumours
generally regress after birth, and cardiac-related problems are rare
after the perinatal period. Tuberous sclerosis and the associated
neurodevelopmental complications dominate the clinical picture,
and should form an important aspect of the prenatal counselling of
parents.
