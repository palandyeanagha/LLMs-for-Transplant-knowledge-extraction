Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by the accumulation of excess liver triacylglycerol 
(TAG), inflammation, and liver damage. The goal of the present study was to directly quantify the biological 
sources of hepatic and plasma lipoprotein TAG in NAFLD. Patients (5 male and 4 female; 44 ± 10 years of age) 
scheduled for a medically indicated liver biopsy were infused with and orally fed stable isotopes for 4 days to 
label and track serum nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs), dietary fatty acids, and those derived from the de 
novo lipogenesis (DNL) pathway, present in liver tissue and lipoprotein TAG. Hepatic and lipoprotein TAG 
fatty acids were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. NAFLD patients were obese, with fast￾ing hypertriglyceridemia and hyperinsulinemia. Of the TAG accounted for in liver, 59.0% ± 9.9% of TAG arose 
from NEFAs; 26.1% ± 6.7%, from DNL; and 14.9% ± 7.0%, from the diet. The pattern of labeling in VLDL was 
similar to that in liver, and throughout the 4 days of labeling, the liver demonstrated reciprocal use of adipose 
and dietary fatty acids. DNL was elevated in the fasting state and demonstrated no diurnal variation. These 
quantitative metabolic data document that both elevated peripheral fatty acids and DNL contribute to the 
accumulation of hepatic and lipoprotein fat in NAFLD.
Introduction
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a term used to describe 
a spectrum of conditions characterized mainly by the histological 
finding of macrovesicular hepatic steatosis in individuals who con￾sume little or no alcohol (1). The classic NAFLD patient has persis￾tently elevated liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and 
alanine aminotransferase [ALT]); has negative test results for viral, 
congenital, and autoimmune liver diseases; and denies excessive alco￾hol consumption (2). Previously, fatty liver was thought to be benign. 
However, it has recently become clear that fatty liver is a precursor 
of the more advanced liver disease nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, a 
condition that may progress to cirrhosis in up to 25% of patients 
(3, 4). Fatty liver is now considered to be the hepatic component of 
the metabolic syndrome (5–8). The specific origin of the lipids that 
accumulate in liver remains unknown, and identifying the origin of 
the accumulated lipids in the livers of patients with NAFLD will be 
important in the prevention and reversal of this condition.
The hallmark feature of the pathogenesis of NAFLD, both his￾tologically and metabolically, is the accumulation of triacylglycer￾ol (TAG) in the liver. The plasma nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) 
pool contributes the majority of the fatty acids that flow to the 
liver in the fasted state and thus provides the bulk of the fatty 
acids secreted by the liver in VLDL particles (9). Insulin resistance 
has been shown to be associated with dysregulation of adipose￾derived fatty acid flux in the fasting state (10–12), and strong evi￾dence exists demonstrating that in NAFLD patients, insulin does 
not suppress adipose tissue lipolysis to the same extent that it 
does in healthy individuals (13).
Yet other sources of fatty acids can contribute to fatty liver, 
and an understanding of fatty acid regulation in the fasted and 
fed states should take these sources into account. The potential 
sources of fats contributing to fatty liver are shown in Figure 1 
and include peripheral fats stored in adipose tissue that flow 
to the liver by way of the plasma NEFA pool (pathway 1); fatty 
acids newly made within the liver through de novo lipogenesis 
(DNL) (pathway 2); and dietary fatty acids, which can enter the 
liver by two means: through spillover into the plasma NEFA pool 
(14) (pathway 3) and through the uptake of intestinally derived 
chylomicron remnants (15) (pathway 4). Isotope methodology 
has been used to quantify fatty acid (9) and TAG (9, 16, 17) flux 
in the fasting state in healthy, obese, and hypertriglyceridemic 
patients, and in one study of NAFLD (18). Using the multiple-sta￾ble-isotope approach, we have recently developed a new method 
to determine the fate of dietary fatty acids during the postprandi￾al state (19, 20), and in the present work we have combined these 
techniques with liver biopsy to simultaneously measure all four 
pathways of fatty acid delivery to the liver in patients suspected of 
having NAFLD. These quantitative metabolic data demonstrated 
that both elevated peripheral fatty acid flux and DNL contribute 
to hepatic and lipoprotein fat in NAFLD.

Results
Clinical and laboratory values of the subjects (5 male and 4 female; 
44 ± 10 years of age) revealed characteristics common to NAFLD 
patients (Table 1). As determined by computed tomography scans, 
both visceral and subcutaneous fat masses were elevated above the 
normal values reported by Dixon (21). Serum ALT was elevated 
in all subjects, serum AST was elevated in most subjects, and in 
most subjects, serum alkaline phosphatase was within the normal 
range (data not shown). In addition, fasting serum TAG concen￾trations revealed hypertriglyceridemia (3.2 ± 2.2 mmol/l) and the 
homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMAIR), 
a quantitative index of insulin resistance (22), was also elevated 
(4.1 ± 2.8; range, 1.2–8.9). The first goal of the present study was to 
assess the hepatic response during transitions from fasting to feed￾ing with respect to how fatty acids from difference sources were 
used for lipoprotein TAG synthesis. In the fasting state on days 
2, 3, and 4, the isolation of large buoyant VLDL (Svedberg flota￾tion unit [Sf], 60–400) revealed an average fasting concentration 
of 1.0 ± 0.9 mmol/l. The rate of appearance of NEFA (RaNEFA) on 
day 2 was 6.3 ± 2.9 μmol/kg/min. The remaining data presented 
at the bottom of Table 1 provide the metabolic context in which 
lipoprotein TAG metabolism was determined and demonstrate 
the expected differences between fasting and feeding (e.g., higher 
insulin concentrations in the fed state, lower NEFA, etc.). Changes 
in fatty acid sources in blood lipids are shown in Figure 2. In both 
states, the majority of serum NEFA originated in adipose tissue 
(Figure 2A). After 4 days of labeling, the average contributions of 
adipose fatty acids to the serum NEFA pool were 81.7% ± 8.2% and 
61.7% ± 11.9% for fasted and fed states, respectively (mean ± SD; 
P = 0.0003). The spillover of dietary TAG into the NEFA pool 
was evident on the very first afternoon after subjects were fed the 
labeled TAG at lunch and contributed 16.3% ± 8.2% of these fatty 
acids. The fed-state contribution of dietary lipid to serum NEFA 
rose to 26.2% ± 8.9% after 4 days of labeling, a value that was signifi￾cantly higher than the fasting contribution on day 5 (10.4% ± 4.9%; 
P = 0.0006). For newly made fatty acids, those in the serum NEFA 
pool could have originated from DNL in adipose or liver. The con￾tribution of DNL to serum NEFA was lower in the fasting state 
than in the fed state (7.0% ± 4.0% versus 9.4% ± 4.5%; P = 0.01). 
The sources of fatty acids in total TAG-rich lipoproteins (tTRLs) 
were analyzed for comparison, and the pattern of labeling in lipo￾protein TAG mirrored that of the serum NEFA pool (Figure 2B). 
After 4 days of labeling, the contribution of adipose- and diet￾derived fatty acids to tTRL TAG synthesis changed significantly 
from fasting to feeding, with adipose-derived fatty acids being 
higher in the fasting state (60.4% ± 18.2% and 27.9% ± 10.2%, 
respectively; P = 0.0001) and diet-derived fatty acids being higher 
in the fed state (12.1% ± 4.1% versus 19.1% ± 8.3%; P = 0.01). In 
contrast, the contribution of DNL to tTRL TAG did not differ 
between fasting and feeding (22.2% ± 8.1% versus 20.4% ± 5.2%; 
P = 0.29). At every time point, the serum NEFA pool contributed 
the most to tTRL TAG, regardless of metabolic state (P = 0.001). 
Evidence of recycling of the isotopes was suggested by the slow rise 
in sources apparent over the 4 days. The contributions of NEFA 
and newly made fatty acids to tTRL TAG increased with time 
(P = 0.007), while the contribution of dietary fatty acids to tTRL 
TAG showed a trend toward increasing with time (P = 0.06).
Changes in the sources of tTRL TAG immediately after consumption of 
a meal. Given previous observations of higher fed-state DNL (23) 
and the known stimulatory effect of insulin on fatty acid synthesis 
(24), we were surprised that fed-state lipogenesis assessed at 1500 
in tTRL TAG did not differ from values obtained in the fasting

state. To determine if fed-state data collected at 1500 each day were 
truly reflective of metabolism after a meal, subjects underwent a 
meal test (breakfast meal). As shown in Figure 2C, these data dem￾onstrate that the contribution of NEFA to tTRL TAG decreased 
from a peak of 55.6% ± 4.3% to a nadir of 32.4% ± 2.9% (P = 0.0004). 
The contribution of dietary TAG to tTRL TAG increased slightly 
after the meal (peaking 3 hours after the meal; P = 0.02) to a value 
that did not differ from the percentage found 3 hours after lunch 
(P = 0.77). After consumption of breakfast, DNL did not change 
from fasting nor were postprandial values different from the value 
3 hours after lunch (P = 0.77).
As described in Methods, VLDL particles were isolated from all 
blood drawn from subjects in the fasting state. For comparison 
with the tTRL, this is represented by unfilled symbols on Figure 
2B. In the fasting state, the sources of VLDL TAG were similar to 
those in tTRLs. The rate of accrual of DNL fatty acids was faster 
than the rate of accrual for dietary fatty acids (3.5% per day ver￾sus 1.7% per day; P = 0.004). This faster rate of accumulation 
resulted in a greater contribution of de novo fatty acids than of 
dietary fatty acids to VLDL TAG (22.4% ± 8.2% and 13.2% ± 6.5%, 
respectively; P = 0.01). The final labeling patterns of lipoprotein 
TAG are summarized in Figure 3A and demonstrate the constant 
contribution of lipogenesis in the fasted and fed states. The con￾tribution of total dietary fatty acids to VLDL TAG was calculated 
to be greater than could be accounted for by entry through the 
serum NEFA pool. These fatty acids, assumed to have entered the 
liver via chylomicron remnant uptake, represented 7.2% ± 5.6% of 
VLDL TAG in the fasting state. The inability to account for all of 
the sources of fatty acids used for tTRL TAG synthesis in the fed 
state (Figure 3A) may have been due to a greater use of unlabeled 
fatty acids for VLDL TAG synthesis, since dietary sources (and 
hence chylomicrons in this fraction) would have been labeled. This 
observation is consistent with a greater appearance of unlabeled 
fatty acids apparent in VLDL TAG found in the early postpran￾dial period in our studies of healthy subjects (M.T. Timlin and E.J. 
Parks, unpublished observations).
On the fifth day of the study, each subject underwent a liver 
biopsy, and the histological results of this procedure are present￾ed in Table 2 (also included for comparison are subject ages and 
BMI). The TAG content of liver tissues ranged from not detectable 
by gas chromatography (below 1 μmol fatty acid) to 0.49 g per 
gram of tissue, which was higher than the 0.01 g per gram of tis￾sue typically observed in healthy populations (25, 26). Histologi￾cal evaluation of liver biopsies indicated steatosis in all subjects, 
inflammation in all but 2 subjects, and progression to fibrosis in 4 
subjects (Table 2). In the liver, labeling with stable isotopes over 5 
days allowed for the identification of 20.4–63.7% of hepatic TAG￾palmitate. No physical or biochemical characteristics correlated 
with the percentage of liver TAG labeled over this period. There 
was, however, a strong correlation between the percentage of TAG 
fatty acid sources accounted for in liver and those accounted for in 
VLDL (Figure 3B), and a weak association between the TAG con￾tent of liver and the percentage of liver TAG accounted for by the 
labeling protocol (r2 = 0.46; P = 0.15). The fractional synthesis rate 
of the total liver TAG pool ranged from 5.1% to 15.5% per day and 
thus the average time estimated for the near-complete turnover 
of this pool was 38.4 ± 15.6 days (Table 2). Although not signifi￾cant, the turnover time tended to be associated with the liver TAG 
content (r2 = 0.37; P = 0.11). To compare sources of liver TAG and 
TAG secreted in VLDL, we normalized the sources contributing to 
both TAG pools to 100% (Figure 3A). In VLDL and liver TAG, no 
differences between the proportions of the three fatty acid sources 
were found. Fatty acids originating in the NEFA pool contributed 
62.4% ± 11.7% and 59.0% ± 9.9%, respectively, with newly made fatty 
acids contributing 22.9% ± 6.2% and 26.1% ± 6.7%, respectively, and 
dietary fats contributing 14.7% ± 8.5% and 14.9% ± 7.0%, respec￾tively. Although NEFA represented the major source of liver TAG, 
the normalized values ranged from 45.1% to 74.3%. The variability 
in the use of newly made fatty acids was 12.7% to 37.0%, with the 
dietary contribution ranging from 4.3% to 28.0%.
Discussion
The accumulation of fat, mainly TAG, within the hepatocyte is a 
prerequisite for the development of NAFLD. However, the prima￾ry metabolic abnormalities leading to lipid accretion are not well 
understood. Various strategies to treat NAFLD are currently focus￾ing on improving glucose tolerance and body weight status (27–31); 
however, an understanding of the origins of the accumulated TAG 
in the liver will strengthen current treatment regimens and aid in 
the identification of new targets for therapy. Using a multiple-sta￾ble-isotope approach in patients who underwent a liver biopsy for 
diagnosis of their condition, we have documented here the sources 
of hepatic and lipoprotein TAG fatty acids, which included serum 
NEFA, newly made fatty acids, and dietary fatty acids. The key 
contributions of this work are that it (a) clearly demonstrated the 
dominance of serum NEFA in liver TAG pools in NAFLD; (b) clari￾fied the effect of insulin resistance manifested through increased 
rates of DNL that fail to respond to nutritional state; (c) expanded

the view of the liver’s diurnal control of fatty acid metabolism, with 
particular emphasis on the contribution of dietary fatty acids to 
human liver TAG pools; and (d) demonstrated for the first time to 
our knowledge the similarity between the fatty acid sources that 
contribute to hepatic TAG and lipoprotein TAG.
The first key finding of our research here was that the serum 
NEFA pool was the primary contributor to hepatic TAG in the 
fasting state and to lipoprotein TAG in both the fasting and fed 
states. Sanyal et al. found elevated insulin concentrations failed to 
suppress adipose fatty acid flux in NAFLD (13), a result that sug￾gested that this source of fatty acids would be important to the 
development of fatty liver. Indeed, NAFLD patients treated with 
insulin-sensitizing agents show marked improvement in their con￾dition (28, 30, 31). Given that the majority of liver fatty acids were 
derived from the serum NEFA pool, therapeutic strategies should 
continue to focus on the reduction of adipose tissue fatty acid flux. 
The second key finding of our research was that DNL was elevated 
in the fasting state and failed to increase postprandially. In the fast￾ing state, 26% of liver TAG and 23% of VLDL TAG fatty acids were 
derived from DNL, indicating that roughly one-fourth of all the 
fatty acids accounted for had been newly made from 2-carbon pre￾cursors derived from glucose, fructose, and amino acids. This eleva￾tion in fasting VLDL TAG from DNL in our subjects was higher 
than the 15% shown by Diraison and colleagues (18), a result most 
likely due to our longer duration of labeling and from the use of a 
lipoprotein fractionation procedure that isolated buoyant VLDL 
particles, representative of those most recently secreted by the liver. 
The presence of a large amount of lipoprotein remnants in hyper￾triglyceridemic individuals would tend to dilute apparent DNL 
in labeling studies less than 6 hours in duration. The 24% DNL 
observed here is twice the 10% reported previously in obese, hyper￾insulinemic subjects (32) and is 4–5 times the less than 5% observed 
in healthy populations (33, 34). We have also recently documented 
a pattern of significant stimulation of lipogenesis in healthy sub￾jects after consumption of a meal, rising from less than 5% to a 
peak of 23% within 4 hours of both the first morning meal and 
lunch (23). For NAFLD patients, the absence of this diurnal pattern 
of DNL was suggested in the daily measurements (Figure 2B) and 
was confirmed with a breakfast test (Figure 2C). Schwarz and col￾leagues found elevations in fasting DNL in obese, hyperinsulinemic 
subjects consuming ad libitum (high-fat) diets and demonstrated 
that those subjects failed to respond in the same manner as healthy 
subjects when switched to chronic consumption of a high-carbohy￾drate diet (32). The healthy subjects’ lipogenesis rates tripled when 
measured in the fasting state after 5 days of high-carbohydrate 
feeding, while no change was observed in the fasting lipogenic rate 
of insulin-resistant subjects consuming the same diet (32). We have 
shown here that chronic consumption of a high-carbohydrate diet 
is not needed to detect this defect, as our NAFLD patients exhibited 
elevated fasting DNL and failed to appropriately increase lipogen￾esis postprandially when fed a meal consisting of 30% fat. The lack 
of postprandial stimulation suggests the liver’s lipogenic potential 
may be reaching a threshold in these patients.
A third key finding of our studies relates to the significant 
extent to which the liver manages its use of the different sources 
of fatty acids that flow to it throughout the day. Inspection of 
Figure 2 demonstrates the reciprocal nature of these fluxes, such 
that during fasting, the hepatic use of dietary fatty acids became 
reduced and the deficit was made up by adipose tissue–derived 
fatty acids. It is well known that postprandially, dietary fatty 
acids spill over into the plasma NEFA pool (35), and we have 
shown here that their use for lipoprotein TAG synthesis rose 
and fell systematically. We have recently measured the extent to 
which dietary fatty acids escape peripheral storage in adipose tis￾sue (by the combination of spillover and liver remnant uptake) in 
healthy subjects (36, 37), and our findings have confirmed that in 
NAFLD, this source can contribute substantially (approximately 
15%) to both liver and VLDL TAG. It is likely that the dietary 
contribution to both TAG pools would be larger if dietary fat 
consumption had been higher than 30% of daily energy require￾ments. Data from mice in our lab confirm that this is the case in 
animals (19, 38). Collectively, these data suggest that the liver’s 
system of fatty acid usage handles fluctuations that result in 
changes of up to 60% of the fatty acids used for VLDL TAG syn￾thesis from fasting to feeding.

The final and most novel finding of our work was a significant 
similarity between the contributions of fatty acid sources found 
in the liver TAG pools and the sources used for TAG secretion by 
the liver via lipoproteins. In many studies, labeling with a glycerol 
or fatty acid isotope has been used to investigate lipoprotein TAG 
synthesis rates (as reviewed previously by Baker in ref. 39 and more 
recently by Patterson in ref. 40), but we have found only 1 paper in 
the literature that combined labeling of VLDL TAG with analysis of 
liver tissue biopsy samples (16). Farquhar and colleagues used a fatty 
acid label in liver turnover studies of 4 men with normal liver TAG 
pool sizes (e.g., estimates between 3 and 11 g TAG/liver, equivalent 
to 0.4–1.0% wet weight of tissue). As only a single fatty acid label was 
used, no comparison could be made between the various fatty acid 
sources contributing to liver and lipoprotein TAG. In our study here, 
the similarity between the 2 TAG pools provides support for future 
studies in which lipoprotein fatty acid may be used as an indicator 
for the liver TAG fatty acid pool in order to determine the success of 
treatments designed to reduce hepatic TAG stores.
The fact that the rates of appearance of labeled fatty acids rose over 
the 5 days of study deserves some comment. We expected (16, 39) 
and observed recycling of fatty acids over this time frame, with the 
majority of recycling potentially routing through the large hepatic 
TAG pool (16). The serum NEFA used for VLDL TAG achieved a 
pseudosteady state after a single day of labeling, and this observa￾tion supports the idea of the presence of a fast hepatic turnover 
pool through which serum NEFAs are routed (see center droplet 
in liver schematic, Figure 1). The significantly higher slope of the 
incorporation of NEFA into lipoproteins than those for the incor￾poration of dietary and DNL fatty acids supports the idea of dif￾ferential handling of this source in the hepatocyte. The accrual 
into VLDL TAG of de novo fatty acids could be due to an increase 
in hepatic pools (i.e., those made locally and packaged into VLDL) 
or due to the accrual of fatty acids synthesized in the adipose that 
came to the liver through the serum NEFA pool, although the lat￾ter mechanism is less likely, given the 4-fold higher presence of 
DNL fatty acids in VLDL than in the serum NEFA pool. The lower 
daily rates of accrual for dietary and DNL fatty acids over the 5 
days suggest that these fatty acids enter a hepatic holding pool

Comparison of sources of TAG fatty acids in liver and lipoprotein frac￾tions. (A and B) Sources of palmitate in VLDL, tTRL, and liver TAG 
accounted for after 5 days of labeling in subjects 1–9 (A), and the cor￾relation between the percentage of TAG accounted for in the liver and 
VLDL (B). For both VLDL and tTRL, fasted-state values represent the 
average source contribution on day 5 at 0700 in subjects 1–9. Source 
contributions to tTRL TAG in the fed state were determined using the 
average values obtained on day 4 at 1500 in subjects 1–9. For com￾parison of liver TAG and VLDL TAG, fatty acid sources were normalized 
to 100%. Subject 3 has been omitted from this analysis due to unde￾tectable concentrations of TAG in liver.

that prevents them from being in immediate communication with 
the pool of fatty acids used for VLDL TAG synthesis. Moreover, as 
the final proportions of fatty acid sources in VLDL and liver were 
similar, it is likely that the liver TAG pool handles these sources of 
fatty acids in a manner similar to that of those newly made.
A number of limitations of this study deserve mention. The first is 
that the duration of isotope labeling was only sufficient to account 
for at most 64% of the sources of liver TAG fatty acids in any one 
subject. The duration of 5 days was chosen from a practical stand￾point as being the longest time that was feasible for patients to be 
absent from work to undergo continuous labeling while staying as 
inpatients at the General Clinical Research Center (GCRC). Second, 
as ethically only 1 liver biopsy could be performed, it was impossible 
to know where on a physiologic turnover curve the liver TAG was 
being sampled. Nonetheless, the estimate of hepatic TAG turnover 
time (5 × t1/2) ranged from 20 to 60 days, which was surprisingly 
long, given estimates of 1–2 days for liver TAG turnover in healthy 
subjects (16, 39, 41, 42). In contrast, for VLDL TAG, 5 days of label￾ing was sufficient time to allow for 100% of the fatty acids to be 
accounted for in 5 of the 9 subjects. In the 4 subjects still secreting 
unlabeled lipoprotein fatty acids at the day-5 time point, the origin 
of this cold pool could not be definitively identified. Visceral fatty 
acids can dilute the serum NEFA label that would not be accounted 
for when sampled peripherally. This would cause an underestima￾tion of the contribution of serum NEFA to VLDL TAG and result in 
the inability to account for all VLDL fatty acids (a visceral dilution 
effect). However, we found a strong positive correlation between 
the percentage of fatty acids accounted for in VLDL TAG and those 
accounted for in liver TAG suggesting that the origin of unlabeled 
VLDL fatty acids was not due to visceral dilution but due to use 
of a cold (unlabeled) hepatic TAG pool. Third, our study lacked a 
control group, because elective liver biopsy in a control population 
was not an option. Thus, whether the pattern of fatty acid sources 
would have been similar in the livers of subjects without NAFLD 
is unknown. However, the change in fatty acid sources found in 
VLDL TAG in both the fasting and fed states was compared with 
that from previous studies (9, 16, 33, 34, 39, 41, 42) and recent data 
from our lab (23, 36, 37). An inability to account for all of the fatty 
acids in VLDL TAG has been observed previously in hypertriglyceri￾demics (9). Furthermore, given our data (23) and other data in the 
literature (34), the lack of increase in lipogenesis postprandially in 
NAFLD is striking. Finally, the goals of our study were to determine 
the sources of fatty acids utilized for liver and VLDL TAG synthesis 
in NAFLD, and measurement of TAG or particle production rates 
was not undertaken. However, data from Charlton et al. have sug￾gested that lipoprotein particle secretion rate (as assessed by apoB 
turnover) is significantly reduced in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis 
(43). Furthermore, using [13C1]palmitate infusion, Diraison et al. 
have demonstrated normal TAG secretion rates in NAFLD (18). In 
the context of those studies, fatty liver could be caused either by low 
particle secretion rates or by an amount of secreted TAG per particle 
that is insufficient to keep up with liver TAG synthesis. If either of 
these events contributed to the fatty liver observed in our patients, 
then elevated DNL would exacerbate the situation. Our data have 
shown that elevated lipogenesis provides a significant source of the 
fatty acids accumulating in the livers of these patients.
In summary, our data provide a quantitative description of the 
fatty acid sources that contributed to both the liver and lipopro￾tein TAG of NAFLD patients after 5 days of labeling. Efforts to 
treat NAFLD by improving insulin sensitivity to reduce peripheral 
fatty acid flux should be expanded to modulate liver lipogenesis 
through dietary and pharmacological therapy. With obesity as a 
key risk factor for NAFLD, and with the recent recognition of the 
ability of simple sugars to stimulate the lipogenic pathway (33), 
dietary therapy that advocates the consumption of complex car￾bohydrates deserves emphasis. One of the underlying causes of fat 
accumulation in NAFLD is the inability of the liver to regulate 
the changes in lipogenesis that should occur during the transition 
from the fasted to the fed state.
Methods
Subjects. Men and women scheduled for a liver biopsy for diagnosis of 
NAFLD were recruited by participating physicians at the clinics of Min￾nesota Gastroenterology (Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA). Patients were 
not referred for the study if alcohol consumption exceeded 20 g/wk or 
if they tested positive for viral hepatitis, Wilson disease, or any other 
possible cause of liver dysfunction. The subjects’ liver function was 
further assessed through measurement of γ-globulins (A, G, E, and M), 
α-1-antitrypsin, α-fetoprotein, ferritin, ceruloplasmin, iron, transferrin, 
and hepatitis A, B, and C. For the present study, potential NAFLD sub￾jects were screened on 2 occasions to obtain a detailed biochemical and 
nutritional assessment. Patients were included in the study if their phy￾sician suspected they had fatty liver, if they had elevated liver enzymes 
upon initial screening, and if they were not in a period of active weight 
loss (defined as weight loss exceeding 0.5 kg/wk). There were no restric￾tions on gender, smoking status, age, or glucose tolerance. Women par￾ticipants were studied during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. All 
subjects gave written informed consent to participate in this research 
study, which was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Uni￾versity of Minnesota (protocol 0106M01801). All medical procedures 
were performed at the GCRC at Fairview University Medical Center 
(Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA).
Procedures. Computed tomography scans without contrast were per￾formed on each participant to quantify visceral and subcutaneous fat 
mass (44). To ensure metabolic steady state, 3 days prior to the 5-day 
inpatient stay, subjects were instructed to consume a defined eucaloric 
diet. This diet was based on previously acquired food records and inter￾views conducted during screening. Subjects recruited were required to 
be maintaining their weight and to be eating diets of typical composi￾tion (55% carbohydrate, 30% fat, and 15% protein). The prescribed diets 
consumed during the 3-day run-in phase were matched to the subjects’ 
background diet; thus, the subjects were deemed to be in stable metabolic 
states. Energy requirements were determined by the Harris-Benedict equa￾tion with an appropriate activity factor. Subjects’ weights were recorded 
daily to ensure weight maintenance throughout the inpatient protocol. 
To trace the sources of lipoprotein and hepatic TAG fatty acids in both 
fasted and fed states, we began isotope infusions 4 days prior to and con￾tinued them through each patient’s scheduled liver biopsy. [13C1]Sodium 
acetate, [1,2,3,4 13C4]potassium palmitate, and [2H31]glyceryl-tripalmitin 
were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratory and Isotec. Isotopic 
purity was greater than 98% for all tracers used. Deuterated tripalmiate 
was used to determine the contribution of dietary fatty acids to hepatic 
and lipoprotein TAG; unpublished data from our lab support the use of 
this isotope in tracking unlabeled dietary fatty acids into the chylomicron 
fraction (M.T. Timlin and E.J. Parks, unpublished observations). To 
measure the contribution of serum NEFA to lipoprotein and liver TAG, 
we began a constant infusion of [13C4]potassium palmitate at a rate of 
2.5 μg/kg/min on day 1 at 1700. Fatty acid synthesis was measured using 
a continuous infusion of sodium [13C1]acetate (10g/d), also beginning at 
1700 on day 1. The contribution of dietary TAG to liver and lipoprotein

pools was measured using [2H31]glyceryl-tripalmitin (1–2 g/d), which was 
administered in whole food with each meal eaten at the GCRC. In both 
the fasted state (0645) and fed state (1500), blood was drawn intermittent￾ly over the 5-day study period and lipoproteins were isolated each day. On 
day 4 of the protocol, subjects underwent a meal test to determine lipid 
flux during the postprandial period. At 0700, a breakfast was consumed 
consisting of whole foods (30% fat, 55% carbohydrate, and 15% protein). 
Of the grams of carbohydrate provided in the meal, 5.3%, 5.6%, 8.6%, 6.2%, 
and 53.4% were from glucose, fructose, lactose, sucrose, and starch, respec￾tively, with the remainder of carbohydrate weight provided by dietary 
fiber. A fasting blood sample was obtained prior to the meal, and blood 
samples were collected immediately after meal consumption for every 
15 minutes until 0800 and hourly thereafter. Indirect calorimetry was per￾formed twice for 30 minutes for the assessment of substrate oxidation in 
the fasted and fed states using a Deltratrac II metabolic cart in the hooded 
mode (Sensor Medix). All blood was drawn into iced Vacutainers contain￾ing 1 mg/ml EDTA. Serum was separated immediately by centrifugation 
(1,500 g for 20 minutes) at 4°C, kept on ice, and separated into aliquots 
for various analyses. The liver biopsy occurred at the GCRC at 0800 on 
day 5 and was performed by the referring physician. Approximately 1 hour 
prior to the biopsy, patients were given an intramuscular injection of 
100 mg meperidine hydrochloride (Abbott Laboratories) plus 50 mg 
hydroxyzine hydrochloride (American Regent).After the biopsy, 15 mg 
of the liver tissue was set aside for analysis of TAG sources. Histologi￾cal evaluation of all biopsies was performed by the same pathologist, and 
samples were graded for the presence of fat infiltration, necroinflamma￾tion, and fibrosis according to the grading system of Dixon (45).
Lipoprotein isolation, lipid extraction, and laboratory analysis. To determine 
whether the sources of TAG fatty acids stored in the liver were utilized 
for TAG exported out of the liver, we isolated lipoproteins from serum 
as described previously (9). Briefly, tTRLs (density < 1.006 g/ml) were 
isolated from serum by ultracentrifugation for 20 hours in a 50.3 Beck￾man rotor (1.3 × 108 g at 10°C). The tTRL fraction (upper 2 ml) was col￾lected by tube slicing. For fed-state samples, tTRLs alone were analyzed. 
Samples collected in the fasting state were dialyzed for 48 hours to a 
density of 1.21 g/ml and were subjected to further lipoprotein fraction￾ation. Briefly, lipoproteins with an Sf greater than 400 were separated by 
ultracentrifugation, and after that, the lipoproteins with an Sf of 60–400 
were separated. The lipoproteins with an Sf of 60–400 represent a frac￾tion with large VLDL particles (diameter, 70–400 nm) that are TAG rich 
and have a very short half-life (46). After the addition of a lipid internal 
standard to the lipoprotein samples with an Sf of 60–400, total lipids 
were extracted from plasma lipoproteins and also from liver tissue by the 
Folch method (47). NEFAs were extracted immediately from serum with 
the addition of 30:70 (vol/vol) heptane/isopropanol. Individual lipids 
from tissue, serum, tTRL and lipoproteins with an Sf of 60–400 were sep￾arated, the TAG and NEFA transesterified (9), and the fatty acid methyl 
esters were analyzed by gas chromatography and gas chromatography/
mass spectrometry (GC/MS) using palmitic acid (16:0) as the marker of 
fatty acid metabolites. Concentrations of glucose in serum samples were 
measured with a Vitros Analyzer 950 (Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics) and 
concentrations of insulin were determined by chemiluminescence immu￾noassay (Diagnostic Products Corporation). Serum TAG and NEFA 
concentrations were determined by enzymatic assay (Wako Chemicals 
USA Inc.) with a microtiter spectrophotometer (Model EL 340 Micro￾plate; Bio-Tek Instruments Inc.). For determination of the enrichment 
of label in the total dietary fat, all foods consumed on a single day were 
placed in a blended. The enrichment of the TAG palmitate of this com￾posite food was quantified by GC/MS and was shown to be 9.9% ± 4.9%. 
Lipoproteins were fractionated from serum collected at 0645 on days 
2, 3, 4, and 5 for the fasting samples and at 1500 for postprandial 
samples. GC/MS was performed on an HP 6890 with a Mass Selective 
Detector HP 5973 fitted with an ETP electron multiplier (SGE Inc.) 
using a HP-1 25-m column, with a 250-μm inner diameter and 0.33-μm 
film thickness and helium as the carrier gas. Electron impact was used 
to selectively monitor ions with mass/charge (m/z) ratios of 270, 271, 
272, 274, 300, and 301. Comparable ion peak areas between standards 
and biological samples were achieved by either adjustment of the vol￾ume injected or by dilution or concentration of the sample. The TAG 
concentrations in liver samples were determined using an HP6890 gas 
chromatograph (Hewlett Packard). The gas chromatograph was fitted 
with an automatic split-injection system and a flame-ionization detec￾tor. A fused silica capillary column was used (50 m in length, internal 
diameter of 0.18 μm, 007-23; Quadrex Corp.), and individual fatty acids 
were identified by retention time and were compared with an internal 
standard for quantification.
Isotope methodology, calculations, and statistics. By tracking the variously 
labeled methyl-palmitate isotopomers (M0, M1, M2, M4, M30, and M31) 
in liver TAG and VLDL TAG using GC/MS, information regarding the 
sources of fatty acids used for TAG synthesis was obtained. These data 
are presented as the proportion of fatty acids derived from the three 
sources (i.e., data are presented as percentage of fatty acids in VLDL TAG 
from NEFAs, lipogenesis, and diet). In liver and lipoproteins, DNL was 
calculated using mass isotopomer distribution analysis (MIDA) (48, 49). 
MIDA is a technique based on combinatorial probabilities, with the 
central principle being that the isotopic enrichment of the molecule of 
interest is directly dependent on the enrichment of the precursor pool 
used for its synthesis. Thus, the labeling pattern in the precursor pool 
is determined by the isotopomer pattern of the polymer. Dietary and 
NEFA enrichments of both liver and lipoproteins were calculated using 
a 5-point standard curve. Comparable ion peak areas between the stan￾dard curve and biological samples were achieved by either dilution or 
concentration of the sample. The RaNEFA into the serum NEFA pool 
was calculated using the steady-state NEFA enrichment obtained on the 
morning of day 2 (approximately 12 hours after the start of infusion). At 
later time points it was anticipated that NEFA recycling would reduce the 
accuracy of this measurement. The infusate composition and enrichment 
were also analyzed by GC and GC/MS and the calculations were adjusted 
for the amount of unlabeled fatty acids present that were derived from 
less than 100% isotopic purity and from fatty acids present on the albu￾min used in the infusion. The sources of serum NEFA as shown in Fig￾ure 2A are adipose, DNL, and diet, although it should be pointed out 
that dietary fatty acids in the NEFA pool are designated as originating in 
chylomicron spillover. Our methodology cannot discern whether these 
fatty acids actually entered adipose and were rereleased into the serum 
NEFA pool. Furthermore, newly made fatty acids in the serum NEFA 
pool could have been synthesized de novo in either adipose tissue (and 
released after TAG lipolysis) or liver (and derived from VLDL spillover). 
The RaNEFA discussed here takes into account the input of unlabeled 
dietary fatty acids that spilled over into the serum NEFA pool. Spillover 
fatty acids were subtracted from the NEFA concentration, then adipose 
contribution was then calculated using this equation for corrected M4.

The percentage of VLDL TAG palmitate derived only from adipose tissue 
release is calculated by Equation 2.

The percentage of VLDL TAG from diet-derived NEFA (the spillover 
pathway) is calculated by Equation 3.
Equation 3
Among all subjects, it was observed that the ratio of [d31]palmitate 
to [13C4]palmitate was always greater in VLDL TAG than in the serum 
NEFA pool. This additional source of dietary fatty acids must be from 
chylomicron-remnant TAG that entered the liver either directly via rem￾nant receptor uptake or indirectly via transfer to HDL, or via lipolysis 
at the hepatocyte. Thus, given Equation 3, the percentage of VLDL TAG 
derived from hepatic uptake of chylomicron-remnant TAG is calculated 
by subtracting the portion of dietary fatty acids derived via the spillover 
pathway from the total contribution of dietary fatty acids to VLDL TAG.
VLDL TAG derived from chylomicron-remnant TAG is calculated by 
Equation 4.
Equation 4
Liver turnover data were calculated using an assumed liver weight of 
2,000 g and an estimation of 5 × t1/2 for near-complete turnover of the 
hepatic TAG pool (50). Differences in source contribution over time were 
analyzed using repeated-measures analysis of variance. Statistical differ￾ences between fasting and feeding and between sources of VLDL TAG 
palmitate and liver TAG palmitate were determined by paired Student’s 
t tests using Statview (version 5.0.1.; SAS Institute Inc.). Correlations 
were analyzed using simple regression. A P value of less than 0.05 was 
considered significant.
