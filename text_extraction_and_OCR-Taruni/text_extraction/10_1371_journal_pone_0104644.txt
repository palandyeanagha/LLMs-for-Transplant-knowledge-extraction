Abstract
Aims: Several studies suggest that circulating bone marrow derived stem cells promote the regeneration of ischemic
tissues. For hematopoietic stem cell transplantation combinatorial granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)/Plerixafor
(AMD3100) administration was shown to enhance mobilization of bone marrow derived stem cells compared to G-CSF
monotherapy. Here we tested the hypothesis whether combinatorial G-CSF/AMD3100 therapy has beneficial effects in
cardiac recovery in a mouse model of myocardial infarction.
Methods: We analyzed the effect of single G-CSF (250 mg/kg/day) and combinatorial G-CSF/AMD3100 (100 mg/kg/day)
treatment on cardiac morphology, vascularization, and hemodynamics 28 days after permanent ligation of the left anterior
descending artery (LAD). G-CSF treatment started directly after induction of myocardial infarction (MI) for 3 consecutive days
followed by a single AMD3100 application on day three after MI in the G-CSF/AMD3100 group. Cell mobilization was
assessed by flow cytometry of blood samples drawn from tail vein on day 0, 7, and 14.
Results: Peripheral blood analysis 7 days after MI showed enhanced mobilization of white blood cells (WBC) and endothelial
progenitor cells (EPC) upon G-CSF and combinatorial G-CSF/AMD3100 treatment. However, single or combinatorial
treatment showed no improvement in survival, left ventricular function, and infarction size compared to the saline treated
control group 28 days after MI. Furthermore, no differences in histology and vascularization of infarcted hearts could be
observed.
Conclusion: Although the implemented treatment regimen caused no adverse effects, our data show that combinatorial G￾CSF/AMD therapy does not promote myocardial regeneration after permanent LAD occlusion.

Introduction
Cytokine mediated mobilization of peripheral blood stem cells
for autologous stem cell transplantation is a generally accepted
therapeutic option for the hematopoietic reconstitution after
myoablative chemotherapy. The clinically used cytokine granulo￾cyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is known to mobilize
various subsets of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC)
into blood circulation that may contribute to tissue repair.
Additionally G-CSF was shown to have anti-apoptotic, anti￾inflammatory and antioxidant effects [1,2,3]. These findings raised
expectations of G-CSF as a promising therapeutic avenue in tissue
regeneration.
Especially in the field of ischemic heart disease numerous studies
investigated the efficacy of G-CSF induced stem cell mobilization
in myocardial regeneration. While early animal studies and small
clinical trials indicated beneficial effects on cardiac regeneration,
these results were later challenged by studies that could not
confirm these positive effects or even reported deleterious effects of
G-CSF therapy on cardiac recovery (for review see [4,5,6]). The
missing benefit of G-CSF induced mobilization of progenitor cells
might be due to a reduced homing capacity as G-CSF treatment
results in significant downregulation of important adhesion
molecules on mobilized cells [7].
Besides G-CSF, the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 (AMD) was
shown to rapidly mobilize stem cells by reversibly disrupting the
interaction between CXCR4 and SDF-1a that tethers stem cells to
the bone marrow (BM) environment [8]. In patients that do not
respond to single G-CSF treatment a combination of G-CSF and
AMD has shown to effectively mobilize hematopoietic stem cells
(HSC) from the BM [9]. Moreover combinatorial G-CSF/AMD
therapy was shown to be superior to single G-CSF therapy with
respect to HSC numbers and is clinically approved for autologous
HSC mobilization [10]. Preclinical studies on AMD in tissue

regeneration showed that acute application leads to enhanced
vascularization of ischemic tissues [11,12] while continuous AMD
treatment has deleterious effects on tissue regeneration [13,14].
This effect was attributed to the crucial role of the CXCR4/SDF￾1a axis in stem cell homing towards injured tissues [7,15].
On the basis of these results we explored possible beneficial
effects of combinatorial G-CSF/AMD therapy in myocardial
regeneration in a mouse model of MI. We applied a treatment
regimen were G-CSF administration started directly after induc￾tion of MI for 3 consecutive days followed by a single dose of
AMD in order to attain positive effects on stem cell mobilization
while avoiding negative effects on stem cell homing.
Methods
Surgical induction of myocardial infarction and study
design
Eight to ten weeks old male FVB/NJ mice (Charles River) were
anaesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of midazolam
(5.0 mg/kg), fentanyl (0.05 mg/kg), and medetomidin (0.5 mg/
kg). The animals were intubated and ventilated using a rodent
ventilator (MiniVent, Hugo Sachs) with a stroke volume of 0.2 ml
and respiration rate of 200 strokes/min. Inhalation anesthesia was
maintained with 1.5% isoflurane through a vaporizer with 100%
oxygen. After left lateral thoracotomy at the left third intercostal
space, the left anterior descending coronary (LAD) was ligated
with 7–0 prolene sutures (Ethicon) 1 mm below the tip of the left
atrial auricle. The chest and skin were closed with 6–0 vicryl
(Ethicon) sutures. The sham group underwent the same procedure
except for the ligation of the LAD. After induction of MI animals
were randomly divided into 3 groups and stem cell mobilization
was induced by the following dosing regimen:
1) G-CSF (250 mg/kg/day; Amgen GmbH) subcutaneously
(s.c.) starting 1 h post-MI and then daily on days 1 and 2; 2)
Combination of G-CSF s.c. starting 1 h post-MI and then daily on
days 1 and 2+ AMD3100 (5 mg/kg/day; Sigma-Aldrich) s.c. as
single dose on day 3 post-MI; 3) the control MI group received at
the same time points equal volumes of saline (0.9% NaCl). Data
acquired from control MI and sham groups contributed in parallel
to another study but were pooled with new animals [16].
Postoperative, mice were housed singly in enriched standard
cages with free access to food and water. Mice were monitored
three times per day during the first three days and two times per
day from day 4–7. After this acute phase, mice were monitored
one time per day. During the first 7 days after MI analgesia was
maintained by buprenorphine application (0.1 mg/kg). The state
of health of mice was recorded on a score sheet. Animals that died
in this study after induction of MI deceased due to acute heart
failure or heart rupture as a result of the intervention. Euthanasia
on the basis of humane endpoints was not done, but humane
endpoints were included in the applied animal care guidelines
approved by the local authorities Landesamt fu¨ r Gesundheit und
Soziales (LAGeSo) and Gesellschaft fu¨ r Versuchstierkunde (GV￾SOLAS). Humane endpoints were: automutilation, sepsis, local
infection, dyspnea/apnea, apathy, dehydration, weight loss over
20% and drastic worsening of the general health condition on the
basis of the score sheet rating. After 28 days mice were sacrificed in
deep isoflurane anesthesia by cervical dislocation by trained
personnel. All animal procedures were performed in accordance
with institutional and federal animal care guidelines and approved
by the ethics committee of the LAGeSo (Permit Number:
G003109).
Flow cytometry analysis of peripheral blood
Whole blood samples were drawn from the tail vein 0, 7 and 14
days after MI and circulating white blood cells (WBC) were
counted with an animal blood counter (Scil Vet abc). For
fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis, blood mono￾nuclear cells were separated via gradient-density centrifugation
using Histopaque-1083 (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were blocked with
normal rat serum and anti-CD16/32 monoclonal antibody (mAb)
(clone 93) in FACS buffer (PBS, 0.5% BSA, 0.05% NaN3) and
incubated with Alexa Fluor 647-labeled anti-Flk-1/VEGFR2
(clone 89B3A5), Phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-Ly-6A/E
(Sca-1) (clone D7), and allophycocyanin(APC)-labeled anti￾CD117 (c-kit) (clone 2B8) (all purchased from Biolegend).
Appropriate isotype controls were always included. Cells were
analyzed on FACSCanto II flow cytometer using FACSDiva
software (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with FlowJo software
(TreeStar).
Hemodynamic measurements
Evaluation of ventricular pressure–volume relationships was
done 28 days after surgical induction of MI in isoflurane
anesthetized ventilated mice as described above. A 1.4F polyimide
pressure-conductance catheter (Millar Instruments) was inserted
through the right carotid artery into the left ventricle to record
baseline pressure-volume loops in the closed chest. Conversion of
raw conductance data to calibrated volumes was performed by
determination of parallel conductance (Vp) using hypertonic saline
dilution method [17,18]. Afterward, mice were euthanized in deep
anesthesia and hearts were excised. Measurements and data
analysis were performed by a blinded person using LabChartH
Software (AD Instruments).
Histology and Immunofluorescence
At day 28, hearts were excised, fixed overnight with 4%
formalin/PBS-buffered and embedded in paraffin. Transversal
sections of a thickness of 3 mm were cut from apex to base and
mounted on glass slides for histological and immunhistochemical
staining. Masson trichrome (MT) staining was done according to
standard protocols. Infarction size was determined using midline
length measurement on MT stained sections from the surgical
LAD occlusion to the base [19]. For the quantification of fibrosis,
blue stained areas of sequential MT stained heart sections were
determined and correlated to the whole heart section area using
ImageJ software. Additionally, infarction size was determined by
staining with 2% tri-phenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC). Therefore,
hearts were frozen at 220uC and cut in semi frozen state into five
equally thick sections. Slices were then incubated in TTC solution
for 15 min at 37uC and fixed in 10% formalin. Viable
myocardium stained red while the infarcted area appeared pale￾white. The area of infarction was measured in each slice with
ImageJ (1.44; National Institutes of Health) software and expressed
as percentage of the entire left ventricular area (including septum).
Vascularization was evaluated by immunostaining with CD31/
PECAM-1 (sc-1506-R M-20 clone, Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
and a-smooth muscle actin (clone 1A4, Sigma-Aldrich) primary
antibody followed by incubation with respective AlexaFluor￾labeled secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). Images were acquired
with a Zeiss Axioskop microscope. Capillary density was
determined by counting CD31/PECAM-1 positive vascular
structures in three randomly chosen high-power fields (each
40000 mm2
) in 10 sections per heart (n = 5–8 for each group)
within the border zone, infarcted and remote area. Alpha-smooth
muscle actin positive vascular structures were counted per area

Statistics
Data are reported as mean value 6 standard error of the mean
(SEM), and were analyzed by two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test.
A p-value of less than 0.1 was considered as a trend a p-value less
than 0.05 was considered significant. Group comparisons were
performed using One-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey’s test.
Survival analysis was assessed by Kaplan-Meier method.
Results
Mobilized peripheral blood cells
Circulating white blood cells (WBC) and progenitor cells were
determined before (0 days) and after MI in drug treated mice and
untreated controls. Treatment with G-CSF (*p,0.05 vs. day 0)
and G-CSF/AMD (p = 0.075 vs. day 0) enhanced the MI induced
mobilization of circulating WBC, without reaching statistical
significance compared to the untreated group 7 days after MI
(Figure 1 upper panel). Mobilization of HSC and endothelial
progenitor cells (EPC) was analyzed by co-expression of receptor
tyrosin kinase c-kit and stem cell antigen-1 (Sca-1) or fetal-liver
kinase-1 (Flk-1) on peripheral blood mononuclear cells, respec￾tively (Figure S1). Although not statistically significant, G-CSF/
AMD3100 treatment led to elevated absolute numbers of c-Kit/
Sca-1 positive HSC into circulation compared to single G-CSF
administration and untreated control mice 7 days after MI
(Figure 1 middle panel). The percentage of HSC was significantly
increased in the control and G-CSF/AMD group (*p,0.05 vs.
day 0), but not in G-CSF treated mice (middle panel inset).
Absolute numbers of EPC were elevated by single treatment with
G-CSF (p = 0.054 vs. day 0) and combinatorial G-CSF/AMD
treatment (p = 0.071 vs. day 0) 7 days after MI (Figure 1 lower
panel). Furthermore, EPC percentages were increased upon drug
treatment, but did not reach statistical significance (lower panel
inset). No synergistic augmentation of circulating cell numbers
could be observed when G-CSF treatment was combined with
AMD after MI.
Survival
A total of 106 mice (38 control MI, 36 G-CSF, 32 G-CSF/
AMD) were included into cumulative Kaplan-Meier survival
analysis. There were no statistical differences in overall mortality
between saline and drug treated groups (Figure 2 A). In order to
prevent that early deaths after surgery has masked beneficial
effects, the 70 (27 control MI, 23 G-CSF, 20 G-CSF/AMD)
animals that survived for the first 4 days after MI were included in
a modified Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. However, even after
exclusion of mice that died early after MI there were no significant
differences in survival rates between saline and drug treated
animals (Figure 2 B). Post-mortem examination confirmed that all
dead mice suffered from MI.
Heart function and infarction size
Surgical induction of MI severely impaired cardiac function
compared to sham-operated animals as assessed by hemodynamic
measurements 28 days after surgery. In sham-operated mice the
left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) was 66.2%65.2 and declined
to 23.8%62.9 (p,0.001) in control MI mice. G-CSF and G-CSF/
AMD treatment did not improve EF 28 days after MI (Table 1).
Detailed examination of P-V loop derived hemodynamic param￾eters confirmed a severely decreased cardiac function in all MI
groups (see Table 1). The parameters stroke work (SW), stroke
volume (SV), cardiac output (CO) and the rate in fall of ventricular
pressure (dP/dt min) were significantly reduced, while end-systolic
and end-diastolic volumes (Ves, Ved) increased in control MI
compared to sham-operated mice. Drug treated animals showed
HPC were not different between control MI and drug treated groups. The HSC fraction was significantly increased in the control and G-CSF/AMD
group (*p,0.05 vs. day 0), but not in G-CSF treated mice (middle panel inset). (lower panel) Flk-1+
Sca-1+ double positive EPC mobilization
peaked 7 days after MI in drug treated mice (p,0.054 G-CSF day 7 vs. day 0; p,0.071 G-CSF/AMD day 7 vs. day 0). EPC fractions were increased upon
drug treatment, but did not reach statistical significance (lower panel inset). Data represent means 6 SEM. (n.10 per group).*p,0.05.

significantly reduced EF, SW, SV and CO compared to sham￾operated animals. The rates in rise and fall of ventricular pressure
(dP/dt max, dP/dt min) and Ves, Ved were not significantly
altered in drug treated compared to sham-operated mice.
However, in comparison to control MI animals, drug treatment
did not significantly improve any of the recorded parameters of left
ventricular function (see Table 1).
Determination of infarction size 28 days post MI either by TTC
staining or midline infarct length method on Masson trichrome
stained sections revealed no significant difference between drug
treated animals and control MI mice (Figure 3 A, B, C).
Quantification of collagen rich fibrotic areas of the infarcted hearts
on sequential transversal sections of Masson trichrome stained
sections revealed no differences in fibrosis between control MI mice
and drug treated groups (Figure 3 D, E). In summary, neither single
G-CSF nor combinatorial G-CSF/AMD therapy significantly
altered left ventricular hemodynamics and infarction size.
Cardiac histology and vascularization
Twenty-eight days after LAD ligation characteristic signs of late
phase postinfarction remodelling of the heart were visible.
Infarcted left ventricles showed typical loss of myocardium, left
ventricular wall thinning and fibrous scar formation. Masson
trichrome staining of infarcted regions revealed a viable subendo￾cardial layer followed by collagen rich fibrous tissue reaching into
border zone myocardium (Figure 4). No obvious differences in
quantity of viable myocardium as well as interstitial collagen
deposition in border zone or remote areas between control MI and
drug treated mice hearts were visible.
EPC as well as certain subsets of WBC are known to exert
angiogenic properties in ischemic tissues. Using antibodies against
endothelial (CD31/PECAM-1) and smooth muscle cells (a-smooth
muscle actin), the abundance of capillaries and arterioles in remote
area (RA), border zone (BZ) and infarct zone (IF) was analyzed
(Figure 5 A). Treatment with G-CSF and G-CSF/AMD had no
significant effect on the vessel density in any of the designated
regions compared to the control MI group (see Figure 5 B, C).
Discussion
In the present study, the potential regenerative properties of a
combinatorial G-CSF/AMD therapy were tested in a model of
permanent LAD occlusion. During the last decade numerous
studies investigated the hypothesis that cytokine mediated
mobilization of stem cells contribute to cardiac regeneration after
MI. Implementing different cytokines and mobilization protocols
these studies yielded controversial results ranging from beneficial
effects to even deleterious effects on cardiac regeneration
[20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28]. Moreover, the precise mode of
action of stem cells in cardiac repair is still a matter of debate.
While some studies showed direct differentiation of stem cells into
functional cardiomyocytes [29,30,31], these results could not be
reproduced by others [32,33] supposing paracrine effects on
surrounding cells to be the cause of regeneration in ischemic
tissues [34,35]. In addition, a number of studies proposed that the
applied cytokine itself directly influences survival of myocytes and
endothelial cells [22,23,24,25,26,36], thereby promoting myocar￾dial recovery and neovascularization. In view of the fact that
cardiac regeneration certainly involves interplay of complex
protective mechanisms this study was aimed to optimize the
mobilization of progenitor cells and combine it with possible
cytoprotective effects of the most widely used mobilizing cytokine
G-CSF. Therefore, we implemented a mobilization scheme in
which G-CSF was applied in a relatively high dosage (250 mg/kg)
for a short period of 3 days starting directly after induction of MI.
This experimental setting was directed to support early cytopro￾tective actions [5] while avoiding long-term detrimental effects of
G-CSF promoted inflammatory processes [20,37].
G-CSF as well as the CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100 has been
shown to mobilize HSPC and potential angiogenic cells from BM
[38,39,40]. However, both agents exhibit different mobilization
kinetics. While G-CSF leads to a delayed mobilization [41,42],
AMD was shown to be a rapid mobilizer leading to a peak
mobilization after 1–3 hours in mice [8,41]. Combination of both
has been proven to synergistically enhance HSPC mobilization in
mice [8] and humans [10] with the potential to promote
neovascularization in a mouse model of hindlimb ischemia [11].
Although considered as a reliable mobilizing agent, continuous
AMD application seems to attenuate positive effects of stem cell
mobilization due to blockade of SDF-1a/CXCR4 mediated stem
cell homing [13,14]. In view of these results, we combined G-CSF
therapy with a single AMD administration at day 3 after MI to
further enhance G-CSF mediated stem cell mobilization while
avoiding negative effects of long term AMD application on stem
cell homing.

In the present study we found that G-CSF and G-CSF/AMD
treatment promoted mobilization of WBC and EPC into
peripheral blood. Mobilization tended to be higher in treatment
groups compared to control mice without reaching statistical
significance. This was due to large variations within treatment
groups suggesting that not all animals responded to the treatment

in the same way. Inter-individual variations in G-CSF induced
HSPC mobilization are also evident in humans [43]. A clear
mobilization of CD34+ cells, but with huge animal-to-animal
variations was also seen in a rat model of MI after G-CSF
treatment by Werneck-de-Castro et al. [27]. Nevertheless, these
inter-individual variations in stem cell mobilization reflect the
practical circumstances that a regenerative therapy has to face.
Combination of G-CSF with AMD did not synergistically
increase WBC counts, HPC or EPC numbers at day 7 after MI (4
days after AMD treatment). The rapid AMD mediated mobiliza￾tion might be an explanation for this, however, significantly
increased EPC mobilization could be detected even 7 days after
single AMD injection in a mouse MI model [12]. Furthermore, the
rather moderate mobilization in the present study could be due to
the specification of HPC and EPC as c-Kit/Sca-1 or Flk-1/Sca-1
double positive cells that likely defines a more specific subtype than
often used single CD34+ or CD133+ HSPC.
Survival analysis showed no significant differences in mortality
between saline and drug treated groups. On the basis of the
applied drug regimen, beneficial effects on cardiac recovery
resulting from either direct or paracrine actions of mobilized stem
cells would not be conceivable until day 4 after MI. However,
exclusion of animals that died in the first 4 days after MI did not
uncover a reduced mortality of drug treated animals. Further￾more, pressure volume relationships of control and drug treated
animals were recorded to evaluate heart function 28 days after MI.
Drastically reduced heart function was evident in control MI mice
compared to sham operated mice. Although G-CSF and G-CSF/
AMD treatment led to a slight improvement of some hemody￾namic parameters, no significant changes compared to the control
MI group were observable. Moreover, there was no reduction in
infarction size visible in drug-treated versus control MI animals.
Since these basic parameters indicated no improvement of heart
regeneration with respect to the applied therapy, histology and
vascularization of infarcted hearts was evaluated. Histological
analysis showed drastically reduced myocardium at the ischemic
site of the left ventricle that was replaced by a thin collagen rich,
fibrous tissue layer. In control MI as well as treatment groups
similar histological pattern were visible showing no obvious signs
of cardiac regeneration.
Besides postulated direct actions of cytokines or stem cells on
myocyte regeneration, numerous studies linked HSPC mobiliza￾tion to favorable angiogenic effects promoting neovascularization
of ischemic tissues [11,14,25,44,45]. On that account, formation of
capillaries and arterioles was determined in the remote area,
border zone and infarcted area of control MI and drug treated
animals 28 days after MI. There were no indications for
significantly altered vascularization in any region of the heart
among MI groups. These results indicated that the applied drug
regimen did not provoke measurable vasculogenic properties. This
is in conflict with studies showing G-CSF and AMD induced
neovascularization [11,12,45]. However, absent effects on cardiac

vascularization [20] and even inhibitory actions of G-CSF on
vascular tubule formation and vascularization of subcutaneous
sponges [46] have been reported by others. The inflammatory
response after myocardial ischemia plays a pivotal role in heart
regeneration being accountable for positive as well as adverse
outcomes [47,48,49]. Elevated WBC numbers, reported in this
study and by others [11,20,21] are capable to induce increased
inflammation and adverse events after myocardial infarction
[37,50]. In a study of Maekawa et al. [51] induction of the closely
related cytokine granulocyte-macrophage stimulating factor (GM￾CSF) led to increased macrophage infiltration into the infarcted
myocardium. Moreover, expression of collagen and fibrogenic
TGF-b1 was increased 14 days after MI. These effects resulted in
infarct expansion, aggravated cardiac remodeling and increased
mortality of treated rats after permanent LAD ligation. Cheng et
al. [20] reported that G-CSF therapy affects expression of matrix￾metalloproteinases (MMP) and their tissue inhibitors (TIMP)
leading to increased fibrosis, mortality and left ventricular
dysfunction after MI in the long term. Our implemented
treatment regimen with G-CSF and G-CSF/AMD did not
provoke negative effects on myocardial regeneration. This might
be due to the short time period of drug therapy starting directly
after MI. Numerous studies showed beneficial effects of mesen￾chymal stromal cell (MSC)- infusion on MI recovery in rodents
and humans [52]. In a study of Pitchford et al. combinatorial G￾CSF/AMD3100 treatment resulted in elevated peripheral EPC
and HSC but not stromal progenitor cells (SPC) [53]. Furthermore
single G-CSF therapy in patients after percutaneous intervention
surprisingly led to decreased numbers of putative MSC in
peripheral blood and had no effect on systolic performance [54].
From these observations it is tempting to speculate that missing
MSC mobilization might be responsible for the poor regenerative
properties of G-CSF or G-CSF/AMD therapy. However, the
precise actions of G-CSF and cell based therapies in cardiac
regeneration are uncertain and divergent results ranging from
multi-level benefits to adverse effects on cardiac remodeling could
be observed. It must be carefully taken into account that in
addition to differences in experimental design, animal dependent
factors such as genetic background, age, body temperature, and
even colony substrain differences critically influence the suscepti￾bility to myocardial ischemia and cardiac healing [55,56].
In conclusion, although the applied drug regimen enhanced the
mobilization of potentially regenerative cells, the combination of
G-CSF and AMD did not significantly improve cardiac recovery
after MI compared to control MI mice. On the other hand, no
adverse effects of the applied drug treatment on cardiac function
and remodeling could be observed. Further studies are needed to
elucidate the complex mechanisms after cardiac injury to figure
out treatment regimens that more specifically promote cardiac
healing.
Study limitations
Beneficial effects of stem cells or cytokines were already
observed after permanent LAD occlusion [25,57] however, this
frequently used model has the limitation that it does not reflect the
actual conditions in patients after angioplasty. The type of model
(permanent vs. transient LAD occlusion) could influence the
regenerative capacities of G-CSF therapy as suggested for
experimental stroke models [58].
