Abstract
Background
This study evaluated the risk factors for delayed graft function (DGF) in a country where its
incidence is high, detailing donor maintenance-related (DMR) variables and using machine
learning (ML) methods beyond the traditional regression-based models.
Methods
A total of 443 brain dead deceased donor kidney transplants (KT) from two Brazilian centers
were retrospectively analyzed and the following DMR were evaluated using predictive
modeling: arterial blood gas pH, serum sodium, blood glucose, urine output, mean arterial
pressure, vasopressors use, and reversed cardiac arrest.
Results
Most patients (95.7%) received kidneys from standard criteria donors. The incidence of
DGF was 53%. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, DMR variables did not impact
on DGF occurrence. In post-hoc analysis including only KT with cold ischemia time<21h (n
= 220), urine output in 24h prior to recovery surgery (OR = 0.639, 95%CI 0.444–0.919) and
serum sodium (OR = 1.030, 95%CI 1.052–1.379) were risk factors for DGF. Using elastic
net regularized regression model and ML analysis (decision tree, neural network and sup￾port vector machine), urine output and other DMR variables emerged as DGF predictors:
mean arterial pressure, � 1 or high dose vasopressors and blood glucose.
Conclusions
Some DMR variables were associated with DGF, suggesting a potential impact of variables
reflecting poor clinical and hemodynamic status on the incidence of DGF.

Introduction
Brazilian studies have reported incidences of delayed graft function (DGF) between 50 and
70%, 2 to 3-fold higher than the rates described by American and European cohorts, despite
similar or more favorable recipient and donor demographics [1–6]. A Brazilian study reported
22.7% incidence of delayed kidney function in a cohort of simultaneous pancreas-kidney
transplants, despite a short mean cold ischemia time of 14h and the use of ideal donors [7].
With similar demographics, international cohorts reported incidences of 4–5% [8, 9]. Notable,
similar to demonstrated in American and European cohorts, DGF in Brazilian transplant
recipients has negative impact on short and long-term outcomes [4, 6, 10].
There is no robust evidence explaining the high DGF incidence in our country, but it is
likely that the suboptimal maintenance care of potential donors before organ recovery has an
important role. Of note, recent studies have shown that achieving optimal donor maintenance
parameters is associated with significant decrease in DGF occurrence [11, 12].
Traditionally, studies evaluating risk factors for DGF adopt standard statistical approaches,
such as logistic regression. These models are useful in analysis using few independent vari￾ables, mainly when the effect of the predictor on the outcome is linear and homogeneous. The
assumptions required to regression-based models are often not reached in clinical research
and important predictor variables may be obscured. Machine learning (ML) methods can
improve precision and accuracy in predicting events, by using more sensitive statistical meth￾ods, with data mining techniques and complex data interactions modeling non-linear interac￾tions [13–15]. As an example, Decruyenaere et al. demonstrated that logistic regression was
not the ideal method for DGF prediction in a Belgian cohort and ML methods performed bet￾ter discriminative capacity [16]. Additionally, other regression-based models are useful and
present better performance, depending on the number of events, number of predictors, vari￾ables characteristic and distribution [17].
This study aimed to evaluate the risk factors for DGF, including in the analysis donor main￾tenance-related (DMR) variables, which were thoroughly investigated from multidisciplinary
records. To increase the analysis accuracy and properly investigate the impact of donor main￾tenance on DGF occurrence, we selected a cohort of brain dead donor (DBD) kidney trans￾plants (KT) performed in a Brazilian region where DGF incidence is high despite the
predominance of ideal donors. In addition, we used ML methods for data analysis beyond
regression models.
Materials and methods
Study design
This study is a retrospective analysis from all deceased donor KT recipients older than 16 years
of age, performed between January 1st 2015 and December 31st 2017 at two Brazilian trans￾plant centers, located in a region with locally predominant use of standard criteria donors
[18]. Preemptive, multiorgan transplants, recipients of machine perfused grafts and those who
lost their grafts or died within 7 days after KT were excluded. In compliance with Brazilian
law, all donors were brain dead.
Data were retrospectively collected by systematic review of medical charts and electronic
database. Patient records and information was anonymized and de-identified prior to analysis.
Due to the observational and retrospective nature of the study, with data anonymously ana￾lyzed, informed consent was not obtained.
The study was performed in accordance with ethical standards of National Health Council
Resolution 466/12 and Declaration of Helsinki, and was approved by Institutional Review

Definitions
Delayed graft function was defined as the requirement for at least one dialysis session during
the first week after KT, regardless of the clinical indication [19]. DGF duration was assessed by
the time until the last dialysis session, and by the number of sessions performed in this period.
To better test the hypothesis that variables not included in traditional DGF predictive mod￾els could explain the high incidence in our country, we opted to calculate the expected inci￾dence of DGF using the nomogram described by Irish et al [1] as a starting point of the study.
Among all available DGF predictive models, Irish nomogram has demonstrated the best pre￾dictive power in validation studies including non-American patients [20, 21]. This nomogram
was developed using United Network for Organ Sharing / Organ Procurement and Transplan￾tation Network (UNOS/OPTN) database and include the following variables: recipient ethnic￾ity, gender, body mass index (BMI), and history of previous KT, diabetes or blood transfusion;
time on dialysis, peak panel reactive antibodies (PRA), human leucocyte antigens mismatches
(HLA MM); donor age, weight, history of hypertension and terminal serum creatinine (sCr),
cause of death, donation after cardiac death, cold ischemia time (CIT), and warm ischemia
time [1]. Since Irish nomogram does not allow the inclusion of machine-perfused kidneys, we
opted to exclude them.
Donor maintenance parameters were evaluated using the Donor Management Goals
(DMG) previously described by US Department of Health and Human Services, Health
Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) [11, 22], with adaptations considering local
peculiarities and the retrospective nature of the study: the lowest arterial blood gas pH during
hospitalization was captured and patients who presented values between 7.3 and 7.45 were
considered in the goal; the highest serum sodium (Na+
) during hospital stay was recorded and
patients who presented values between 135 and 155 mEq/L were considered in the goal; the
target for the highest blood glucose was � 150 mg/dL; diuresis in the last 24h prior the recov￾ery surgery was considered adequate when between 0.5 and 3 mL/Kg/h; the lowest mean arte￾rial pressure was in the goal when between 60 and 110 mmHg; and target for vasopressors was
the use of � 1 vasoactive drug with norepinephrine <0.5 μg/Kg/min. The highest creatine
phosphokinase (CPK), history of reversed cardiac arrest and acute kidney injury during hospi￾talization were also evaluated.
Statistical analysis
Categorical variables were presented as frequency and percentage and compared using Chi￾square or Fisher tests. Normally distributed continuous variables were summarized as mean
and standard deviation and compared using Student’s t-test. Median was included in descrip￾tion of non-parametric continuous variables and comparison was performed using Mann
Whitney-test. A multivariable logistic regression model was fitted to compute covariate￾adjusted odds ratios (OR) for DGF. Twenty-seven variables were included in the model. Col￾linear variables (“final sCr” and “difference between final and initial sCr”) and those with
more than 10% of missing values (“CPK”) were excluded. Diabetic donors were also excluded,
since this was a near-zero variance predictor (all patients who received grafts from diabetic
donors developed DGF). A p-value of <0.15 in univariable analysis was considered statistically
significant for including variables in multivariable analysis. For all other analysis, a p-value of
Donor maintenance and its impact on delayed graft function

<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS
v.23.0 software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Predictive models for DGF were constructed using a supervised model, according to the fol￾lowing steps: data acquisition, data processing, model construction, and model evaluation. In
data processing step, the outcome category was balanced to achieve equal proportions. In pre￾process we perform recursive feature elimination to select the predictable variables with better
correlation with the outcome. Variables with moderate / strong correlation with DGF
(r > 0.80) were included in the model.
Population was randomly divided into training and testing set with a stratified 70:30 split.
Six supervised ML algorithms were developed with this subset of variables in the training set:
neural network (NN), support vector machine (SVM), C5 decision tree (DT), CHAID DT, k￾nearest neighbors (KNN) and logistic regression with stepwise selection. Area under the
receiver operating curve (AUC) was calculated to test the ability of each model to distinguish
patients in testing set. SPSS Modeler v.18.1 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) was used to construct
predictive models.
As an additional sensitivity analysis, we performed Elastic Net regression, a regularization
model that mix Lasso and Ridge regressions. While Lasso regression enhances the prediction
accuracy and interpretability of the statistical model by variable selection and regularization,
Ridge regression improves prediction by shrinking large regression coefficients to reduce over￾fitting. Elastic net regression also provides a more interpretable model when compared to
black-box results of ML methods. For this analysis, numerical predictors were normalized by a
Box and Cox transformation and after center and scale. Median were imputed for missing val￾ues. Categorical predictors were dummy encoded. We used an alpha of 0.1 and 10-fold cross￾validation to search lambda. After an optimal search of a lambda, we perform an elastic net
with R package glmnet [23]. Those coefficients inferior or greater than zero are considered rel￾evant predictors. Variables whose coefficient was zero were considered not important for DGF
prediction.
Results
Recipient and donor demographics
From 954 KT performed in the period, 30 were living donor transplants, 70 were allocated to
patients younger than 16 years, 16 were multiorgan transplants, 8 were preemptive KT, 365
recipients received machine perfused grafts, and 22 lost the graft or died in the first week. The
final analysis included 443 DD KT. The incidence of DGF was 53%, the mean time of DGF
was 11.8 ± 15.0 days (median 7 days) and mean number of dialysis sessions was 5.0 ± 5.1
(median 4). According to Irish nomogram, the expected incidence of DGF was 19% and this
tool showed poor predictive accuracy (AUC 0.685).
Recipient and donor demographic characteristics are detailed in Tables 1 and 2. Patients in
DGF group were older (45.6 ± 14.4 vs. 42.6 ± 15.0 years old, p = 0.030), presented higher prev￾alence of pretransplant diabetes (21.3 vs. 13.5%, p = 0.034), and longer time on dialysis (36 vs.
27 months, p = 0.001). Donors in DGF group showed higher mean age (33.2 ± 12.6 vs.
28.5 ± 12.3 years old, p<0.001), higher body mass index (BMI) (25.7 ± 3.5 vs. 24.9 ± 4.0 Kg/
m2
, p = 0.038), higher prevalence of hypertension (7.2 vs. 3.4%, p = 0.002), higher terminal sCr
(1.2 ± 0.7 vs. 1.0 ± 0.5 mg/dL, p = 0.001), and higher Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI)
(35.1 ± 23.0 vs. 28.4 ± 19.7%, p = 0.001). Of note, 433 donors (97.7%) presented KDPI � 85%.
The main perfusion solution was histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) (83.1%), fol￾lowed by University of Wisconsin (UW) (13.1%) and Institute Georges Lopez-1 (IGL-1)
(3.8%) and this variable did not impact on DGF incidence. There were no differences between

groups regarding vascular anastomosis time (36.5 ± 12.3 vs. 35.6 ± 11.1 min, p = 0.440) and
anti-thymoglobulin induction therapy (99.1 vs. 96.6%, p = 0.090). However, DGF group pre￾sented longer CIT (21.7 ± 3.8 vs. 20.1 ± 4.1h, p<0.001).
Donor maintenance
Donor maintenance parameters data (Table 3) showed the poor clinical and hemodynamic
conditions experienced by donors: high need for vasopressors (95.9%), substantial incidence
of reversed cardiac arrest episodes (12.2%), high CPK (median 951 UI/L), increased serum
Na+ (160.0 ± 13.8 mEq/L) and poor blood glucose control (193.3 ± 77.7 mg/dL). DGF group
had lower percentage of donors reaching blood glucose target (26 vs. 37.5%, p = 0.010) and
lower urine output in the last 24h prior to recovery surgery (median 0.9 vs. 1.2 mL/Kg/h,
p = 0.005).
Risk factors for DGF
In logistic regression analysis, variables independently associated with DGF were: recipient
history of diabetes (OR 1.922, 95% CI 1.119–3.302, p = 0.018), time on dialysis (OR 1.009, 95%
CI 1.004–1.014, p<0.001), donor hypertension (OR 2.331, 95% CI 1.247–4.355, p = 0.008),
final sCr (OR 1.947, 95% CI 1.320–2.872, p = 0.001), and CIT (OR 1.115 95% CI 1.058–1.175,
p<0.001). However, logistic regression presented poor predictive performance, both in

training (AUC 0.686) and testing set (AUC 0.695). To best explore the impact of donor main￾tenance variables on DGF incidence, logistic regression multivariable analysis was repeated in
two subgroups of CIT, based on the median value of the total cohort (21h). The incidences of
DGF were 48.2% and 57.8% in CIT<21h and CIT�21h subgroups, respectively. Of note, in
CIT<21h subgroup, in addition to the previously demonstrated variables (time on dialysis,
donor hypertension and CIT), urine output (OR 0.639, 95% CI 0.444–0.919, p = 0.016) and
serum Na+ (OR 1.030, 95% CI 1.007–1.053, p = 0.010) were also risk factors for DGF (Table 4).
The results of Elastic Net regression are illustrated in Fig 1. Variables in red were risk fac￾tors for DGF and variables in blue were associated with reduced risk of DGF. This model pre￾sented better predictive performance when compared to logistic regression (AUC 0.749).
The three statistical methods of better performance in analyzes using ML techniques were:
boosted DT using C5.0 algorithm (AUC 0.791), boosting NN (AUC 0.886), and SVM with
polynomial kernel (AUC 0.784). Fig 2 illustrates ML results and predictive performance. Vari￾able are presented using the feature importance graph, in which higher the value of the fea￾ture/variable, more important it was to predict DGF. The feature importance was normalized
between 0 and 1 by dividing by the sum of all feature importance values. As demonstrated in
Fig 2, urine output, mean arterial pressure, and the use of more than one vasoactive drug or
high dose vasopressor were predictive of DGF in all models. Blood glucose was predictive of
DGF in DT and SVM models.
Discussion
This study suggest that poor donor clinical and hemodynamic status may impact on DGF
occurrence, and this might explain the high incidence of DGF in Brazil, where the incidence is
significantly higher than that the predicted by available formulas.

In our cohort, DGF incidence was almost 3-fold higher than the predicted by the nomo￾gram described by Irish et al, suggesting an important role of variables not included in the pre￾diction model. In fact, none of the available predictive models includes in final formula
variables reflecting donor maintenance. Except for terminal serum creatinine (that could
reflect renal consequences of hypovolemia, shock and other causes of acute kidney injury),
only the score developed by Chapal et al analyzed some variable related to donor care (type of
vasopressor) [24].
Only 4.3% of patients received kidneys from expanded criteria donors and 97.7% had KDPI
below 85%, suggesting good structural quality kidneys. On the other hand, 12.2% had a
reversed cardiac arrest episode before organ recovery surgery, 47.4% presented acid-base dis￾orders, 61.6% had hypo- or hypernatremia, and 68.6% showed inadequate glycemic control,
reflecting poor clinical and hemodynamic conditions. The impact of poor donor maintenance
in our country has previously suggested in a study including simultaneous pancreas-kidney
transplants. In this cohort, despite favorable demographics, the incidence of delayed kidney

graft function was 22.7% and donor hypernatremia was an independent risk factor for DGF
[7].
The challenge of properly maintaining potential deceased donors seems not to be exclusive
of our population. Previous American and Canadian studies have reported low adherence to
donor-care bundles at the time of consent for donation. Importantly, the early achievement of
donor management goals was associated with a reduced risk of DGF in these studies [11, 12].
The high CIT was notable and its contribution to DGF is unequivocal. All statistical analysis
demonstrated that each additional hour matters, even in KT with CIT < 21h. The large

territorial extension, the allocation model predominantly based on HLA compatibility, and the
absence of specific allocation policies for “marginal” donors contribute to the long CIT in our
country [25]. However, it is noteworthy that almost half of KT with CIT <21h presented DGF,
suggesting the contribution of other factors beyond the CIT.
Due to the high negative impact of CIT on DGF incidence, potentially masking other pre￾dictors, we performed a post-hoc analysis including a regression model on a sub-sample of
patients with CIT inferior to 21h. As hypothesized, variables reflecting donor maintenance
now emerged. Additionally, in ML analysis, donor maintenance related variables, such as
blood pressure, use of high dose vasopressors, urine output and blood glucose, were also asso￾ciated with DGF. To further explore the contribution of other than the traditional variables to
DGF incidence using a more interpretable model, we performed a sensitivity analysis using
elastic net regression. Again, beyond the traditional conditions associated to DGF occurrence,
variables reflecting donor management were risk factors (serum Na+, blood glucose) or pro￾tective (high dose vasopressors and diuresis).
Recently published studies demonstrated the impact of donor hemodynamics as a predictor
of DGF in transplantation from donors after cardiac death [26, 27]. However, evidences are
scarce on transplantation of brain dead donors.
Our study has limitations that should be pointed out. First, it was a retrospective cohort;
therefore, the capture of variables was limited to those available on medical records. We cannot
assure that our results are generalizable to other transplant centers worldwide. Donor mainte￾nance related variables (and DMGs) are not static and we could not evaluate them dynami￾cally. Since we could not follow variables over time and assess adherence to care bundles, it is
possible that some clinical and hemodynamic data reflected the severity of the disease that led
to brain death and not the patient care. Besides, it’s possible that some clinical and hemody￾namic parameters reflected patient situation before they became a consented donor, and thus
may not reflect donor maintenance, but general intensive care. Finally, variables reflecting
perioperative care were not available.
In conclusion, DGF incidence in Brazil is significantly higher than that predicted by available
models. Although our data do not allow us to draw definitive conclusions, this study suggests that
donor illness severity and hemodynamic instability might contribute to this scenario. Prospective
studies are needed to robustly conclude how donor management impacts on DGF incidence.
Additionally, a cohort including machine-perfused grafts may be useful to explore if pumping
might mitigate kidney damage secondary to poor donor clinical and hemodynamic status.
We believe bringing this issue up is crucial in our setting. Scant donor care is probably a
reflection of the poor economic conditions of our country. However, some educational actions
could be taken, focusing on early recognition of potential donors and training staff who care
for brain death patients.
