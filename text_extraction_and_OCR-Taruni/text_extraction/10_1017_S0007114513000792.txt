Abstract
Intermittent energy restriction may result in greater improvements in insulin sensitivity and weight control than daily energy restriction
(DER). We tested two intermittent energy and carbohydrate restriction (IECR) regimens, including one which allowed ad libitum protein
and fat (IECR þ PF). Overweight women (n 115) aged 20 and 69 years with a family history of breast cancer were randomised to an overall
25 % energy restriction, either as an IECR (2500–2717 kJ/d, ,40 g carbohydrate/d for 2 d/week) or a 25 % DER (approximately 6000 kJ/d
for 7 d/week) or an IECR þ PF for a 3-month weight-loss period and 1 month of weight maintenance (IECR or IECR þ PF for 1 d/week).
Insulin resistance reduced with the IECR diets (mean 20·34 (95 % CI 20·66, 20·02) units) and the IECR þ PF diet (mean 20·38 (95 % CI
20·75, 20·01) units). Reductions with the IECR diets were significantly greater compared with the DER diet (mean 0·2 (95 % CI 20·19,
0·66)mU/unit, P¼0·02). Both IECR groups had greater reductions in body fat compared with the DER group (IECR: mean 23·7 (95 %
CI 22·5, 24·9) kg, P¼0·007; IECR þ PF: mean 23·7 (95 % CI 22·8, 24·7) kg, P¼0·019; DER: mean 22·0 (95 % CI 21·0, 3·0) kg).
During the weight maintenance phase, 1 d of IECR or IECR þ PF per week maintained the reductions in insulin resistance and weight.
In the short term, IECR is superior to DER with respect to improved insulin sensitivity and body fat reduction. Longer-term studies into
the safety and effectiveness of IECR diets are warranted.
Key words: Intermittent energy restriction: Low-carbohydrate diets: Weight loss: Daily energy restriction: Insulin resistance
The global health burden of obesity-related conditions such as
diabetes, CVD, dementia and certain cancers, including breast
cancer, may be reduced by weight loss and the associated
improvements in insulin sensitivity. The difficulties of achiev￾ing and sustaining weight loss by energy restriction are well
known(1). Even when reduced weights are maintained, meta￾bolic benefits achieved with weight loss are often attenuated
because of non-compliance or adaptation(2–4). Effective
dietary interventions are needed that promote long-term
adherence and sustained beneficial effects on metabolic and
disease markers. Such interventions need to be palatable
and satiating, meet minimal nutritional requirements, promote
loss of fat and preserve lean body mass, ensure long-term
safety, be simple to administer and monitor and have wide￾spread public health utility.
Multiple dietary approaches have been studied that vary in
macronutrient composition(5) and the degree of energy restric￾tion(6). These typically achieve long-term 5 % weight loss in

30–35 % of subjects(7–9). Recent large-scale, long-term
(2-year), randomised studies have reported no significant
differences in long-term compliance, weight loss(5) or clinical
effectiveness(10) between diets providing 15–65 % of energy as
carbohydrate and 25–40 % of energy as protein. However, in
shorter-term (3–4-month) studies, higher-protein diets provid￾ing 20–25 % energy as protein consistently report greater
satiety, preferential loss of fat and preservation of fat-free
mass (FFM) compared with lower-protein diets (15 % energy
as protein)(11).
Most weight-control programmes use daily energy restriction
(DER), but intermittent energy restriction (IER) has been
suggested as a possible alternative approach. IER may be
easier to follow and potentially has greater positive metabolic
effects since it includes repeated spells of more profound
energy restriction than achieved with DER, albeit for short
periods(12). In animal models, IER is superior or equivalent to
DER with respect to longevity(13), the reduction of breast(14),
prostate(15) and pancreatic(16) cancers, and the reduction of car￾diovascular and cerebrovascular disease(17) and dementia(18).
The optimal duration of restricted dietary periods within IER
for weight loss and health benefits in human subjects is not
known. Relatively short periods of restriction of up to 20h
appear to be ineffective(19). Alternate-day fasting is feasible in
human subjects but has not been directly compared with
DER(20). Also, three weekly periods of restriction reduce tumours
in rodents but are unlikely to be acceptable in human sub￾jects(14). Preliminary studies in human subjects have shown
that periods of 2–7d of IER may be as effective as DER for
weight loss(21,22), and may be linked to greater improvements
in insulin sensitivity(22) and lipid profiles(23) compared with DER.
Here, we report the effectiveness with respect to the change
in insulin resistance, weight and adiposity, of an intermittent
energy and carbohydrate restriction (IECR, 2500–2717 kJ/d,
,40 g/d of carbohydrate) for 2 d/week. Restricted days were
low in carbohydrate and relatively high in protein and fat
(20 % energy from carbohydrate, 45 % protein and 35 % fat),
to maximise satiety and food choice and to limit the loss of
FFM within the energy restriction period(11). In an attempt to
make the 2 d/week IECR diet more acceptable and further
limit hunger and the loss of FFM, we also tested an alternative
IECR diet that included unrestricted (‘ad libitum’) protein and
fat (MUFA and PUFA) (IECR þ PF), which was anticipated
to self-limit energy intake to approximately 5000 kJ/d
(approximately 15 % energy as carbohydrate, 35 % protein
and 50 % fat) on restricted days. We compared the two
low-carbohydrate IECR regimens to the widely used DER
that is relatively high in protein with moderate fat and carbo￾hydrate (45–50 % energy as carbohydrate, 20–25 % protein
and 30 % fat) over 4 months including 3 months of weight
loss and 1 month of weight-loss maintenance(11).
Methods
Study design and participants
The present randomised trial was performed as a single-centre
study at the Family History (Genetics) Clinic at the Genesis
Prevention Centre, University Hospital of South Manchester
NHS Foundation Trust. Participants were enrolled between
September 2009 and January 2011. Women were eligible for
the study if their BMI was 24–45 kg/m2 and/or body fat
was .30 % of total weight, and their reported adult weight
gain since the age of 20 years exceeded 7 kg. There was no
age restriction but subjects entered were between 20 and
69 years of age. Women were excluded if they were currently
dieting or losing weight, or suffering from diabetes, major
CVD, respiratory, psychiatric or musculoskeletal morbidity.
All participants were at an increased risk of breast cancer
by virtue of a family history (lifetime risk of breast cancer
$16 % assessed using the Tyrer–Cuzick risk prediction
model(24)), but had no personal history of breast cancer and
had a normal mammogram within the previous 12 months.
Women were approached by mail shot. Interested participants
were screened to assess their physical and psychological
health and motivation to lose weight by the study dietitians
(M. H., C. W. and M. P.), and were asked to complete a trial
of the 2 d IECR before recruitment. Of 142 eligible women
identified after screening, eighteen women (12 %) were
unable to tolerate the 2 d trial and a further nine (6 %) did
not try the diet, but felt they would not be able to follow
the IECR diet for 4 months if allocated (Fig. 1). The study
was conducted according to the guidelines laid down in the
Declaration of Helsinki and the principles of Good Clinical
Practice. All procedures involving human subjects were
approved by the North Manchester Research Ethics Committee
(reference 09/H1006/34). Written informed consent was
obtained from all subjects. The trial registration number is
ISRCTN52913838 (http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN5
2913838/).
Randomisation and masking
Eligible women were randomly assigned to the three dietary
interventions 1:1:1 for a 3-month weight-loss period and a
further 1-month period of weight stabilisation. Participants
were stratified by baseline BMI (above or below the predicted
median value of 27 kg/m2
) and menopausal status with post￾menopausal defined as 12 months after the last menstrual
period or a surgically induced menopause. Group allocation
was established by opaque, sealed envelopes that contained
the assignment for each subject. Personnel performing labora￾tory measurements, and inputting and analysing trial data
were blinded to group allocations. Anthropometric measures
were performed by research dietitians who were not blinded
to the treatment groups.
Dietary interventions
The IECR and DER interventions involved an overall 25 %
energy restriction. This was calculated from estimated baseline
energy requirements using reported metabolic equivalent
of task £ estimated BMR(25,26) and ranged from 5040 to
7560 kJ/d among the participants. The DER group was pre￾scribed a daily energy-restricted Mediterranean-type diet that
was relatively high in protein (25 % energy) with moderate

carbohydrate (45 % energy from low-glycaemic-index carbo￾hydrates) and moderate fat (30 % fat; 15 % MUFA, 8 % PUFA
and 7 % SFA) intakes(27). It included five fruit and vegetable
portions, nuts and seeds, whole-grain cereals, olive oil, fish
and seafood, a moderate consumption of dairy products,
poultry, eggs, and lean red meat and processed meat
(,400 g/week)(28).
Participants randomised to IECR were asked to restrict
energy and carbohydrate on two consecutive days each
week (70 % energy restriction and 40 g carbohydrate) and
to consume a euenergetic Mediterranean-type diet that met
their estimated energy requirements for the remaining 5 d of
the week. Restricted IECR days provided between 2500 and
2717 kJ and included approximately 250 g of protein foods
including lean meat, fish, eggs, tofu, textured vegetable pro￾tein, three servings of low-fat dairy foods (e.g. 195 ml semi
skimmed milk, 150 g low-fat yoghurt, 30 g low-fat cheese),
four portions of low-carbohydrate vegetables and one portion
of low-carbohydrate fruit, at least 1170 ml of other low-energy
fluids, and an over-the-counter multivitamin and mineral sup￾plement providing the RDA for vitamins and typically 20–50 %
for minerals on restricted days. Participants randomised to
IECR þ PF had a diet virtually identical to the IECR group
but were allowed unlimited lean meat, fish, eggs, tofu,
MUFA and PUFA on restricted days. Both intermittent diets
were limited in SFA (,10 % energy). Participants in all the
three intervention groups were advised to limit but not necess￾arily abstain from alcohol.
At 3 months, women were advised to follow euenergetic
diets for weight maintenance based on revised requirement
estimates using weight and activity levels measured at this
time. The DER group continued with a daily euenergetic Med￾iterranean-type diet, while the IECR and IECR þ PF groups
included one restricted day per week and the standard Medi￾terranean-type diet for the remaining 6 d.
The diets were not provided centrally, but were self￾selected using detailed individualised food portion lists, meal
plans and recipes. All participants were advised to gradually
increase the frequency and intensity of exercise according to
current activity levels, to aim to undertake 5 £ 45 min of mod￾erate activity/week (metabolic equivalent of task .3). Each
participant received a booklet outlining a home-based
programme of walking, strengthening, toning and flexibility
exercises(29). Diet and exercise advice was provided and
reinforced for each subject by their designated study dietitian.
Study dietitians used a range of accepted behaviour change
techniques that included discussing the consequences of
behaviour change in relation to the risk of breast cancer and

other diseases(30). Women received fortnightly motivational
phone calls and monthly clinic appointments where they
received feedback on their progress with weight and anthro￾pometric measurements, and the revision of diet and exercise
behavioural goals. All participants were encouraged to use a
range of established cognitive behavioural techniques to
adhere to their diet and exercise(30).
Study measurements
Measurements were made before starting each diet and after
1, 3 and 4 months. Measurements were weight, total body
fat and FFM determined by multi-frequency bioelectrical
impedance (MC180MA; Tanita Europe BV), waist, hip and
bust circumferences, systolic and diastolic blood pressure
(BP Dinamap Carescape V100; GE Healthcare Technologies)
and blood and urine sampling. All assessments were con￾ducted in the morning after a 12 h fast. Subjects were asked
to abstain from vigorous activity and alcohol for 24 h before
the assessment. They were asked to drink water on the assess￾ment morning and emptied their bladder immediately before
the weight and impedance measurements. Both IECR groups
were assessed at least 5 d after their weekly 2 d restriction to
avoid any potential acute effects of the 2 d restriction on
weight or blood markers which we reported previously(22).
Weight and body fat were assessed wearing light clothing.
Body circumferences were measured in triplicate; waist was
measured at the umbilicus and hips at the widest point over
the trochanters. Blood pressure was measured in triplicate
after 10 min at rest.
Fasting insulin, glucose, cholesterol, TAG, HDL-cholesterol
(analysed as described previously(22)) and glycated Hb
(HbA1c, ion-exchange HPLC method, Bio-Rad turbo HbA1c,
Bio-Rad Laboratories Limited, CV 1·3 %) were measured at
the Clinical Biochemistry Department at the University Hospi￾tal of South Manchester NHS Foundation Trust(22). Fasting
insulin and glucose were combined to calculate the insulin
resistance index using the homeostasis model assessment
(HOMA)(31). LDL-cholesterol was calculated using the formula
of Friedewald et al.(32). The remaining assays were performed
at the National Institute on Ageing. Plasma leptin and adipo￾nectin, plasma and urine ketone bodies were analysed as
described previously(22), and plasma and urine oxidative
stress markers (advanced oxidation protein products)
analysed using a modified method of Selmeci et al.(33).
Serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1, CV 5·9 %), IL-6
(CV 2·9 %) and TNF-a (CV 4·9 %) were measured using
ELISA from Alpco Diagnostics, R&D Systems and Linco–Millipore,
respectively. The leptin:adiponectin ratio was also estimated(34,35).
All blood and urine samples were stored at 48C and frozen at
2708C within 24 h. Blood samples were centrifuged within 4 h
of collection to separate the serum from the cells. Samples
were batched so that all samples from a participant were
included in the same assay(36). After 3 months on the diets,
a subset of women (six IECR and five IECR þ PF) provided
fasting samples on the morning immediately before and the
morning immediately after their 2 d restriction, and then
after 2 d of their unrestricted Mediterranean diet to assess
any acute effects of the diets on disease risk markers.
Adherence to the dietary interventions at 1, 3 and 4 months
was assessed using 7 d food diaries checked for completeness
with the respondent. Mean daily energy, protein, carbo￾hydrate, total fat, SFA, PUFA, MUFA, fibre (Association of Offi￾cial Analytical Chemists method) and weekly alcohol intakes
were estimated using WISP (Tinuviel Software). In addition,
both IECR groups were asked to record whether they had suc￾cessfully completed either 0, 1 or 2 d of restriction each week
during the study period.
Hunger and appetite were assessed using validated visual
analogue scales(37) at the end of the first and second restricted
days and after five unrestricted days, and for three corre￾sponding days of the week for the DER group. Physical
activity was assessed from 7 d activity diaries, which recorded
specific activities and sedentary behaviours and categorised
the intensity of activity using a ten-point effort rating
scale(38). Trained investigators blinded to the group allocation
categorised activities into metabolic equivalents of energy and
hence the time spent in moderate (metabolic equivalent of
task 3–5·9) or vigorous (metabolic equivalent of task .6·0)
activity each week(25). We also assessed the effects of the
diets on mood using the Profile of Mood States question￾naire(39), and asked women to report any adverse or positive
physical or psychosocial effects of the diets throughout the
4-month trial.
Statistical analyses
The sample size of thirty-eight subjects/group was initially
chosen to detect a difference of 0·8 unit HOMA insulin resist￾ance between the IECR and DER groups (corresponding to a
50 % decrease in IECR v. a 5 % decrease in DER) with 80 %
power (assuming a standard deviation of 1·1 unit), allowing
for a 20 % dropout as a per-protocol analysis. We considered
it more appropriate to report a comparison of the three dietary
groups (adjusting for multiple testing with Bonferroni correc￾tion) with an intention-to-treat analysis that includes all sub￾jects in a last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) analysis.
This comparison has 80 % power to detect differences of 0·8
or more.
Data at baseline, 1, 3 and 4 months are presented as means
(95 % CI) or geometric means (95 % CI) for log-transformed
variables (fasting insulin, insulin resistance, HbA1c, adiponec￾tin, leptin, leptin:adiponectin ratio, total IGF-1 and dietary
parameters), or medians (95 % CI) for non-parametric vari￾ables (plasma IL-6, TNF-a, alcohol, physical activity and
systolic blood pressure). The primary analysis was an intention￾to-treat LOCF ANCOVA at 3 months between the groups defined
at randomisation adjusted for the baseline level of each
parameter. We also conducted a sensitivity analysis of women
who completed the 4-month study. This showed the same mag￾nitude of differences as the LOCF analysis, although, as expected,
due to the smaller numbers, differences were no longer statisti￾cally significant. Statistical significance was accepted at P,0·05.
Data were analysed using SPSS (version 15; SPSS Limited).

Results
Study population
Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the three
groups of randomised women are reported in Table 1. The
groups were of comparable age, menopausal status and simi￾lar with respect to other demographic characteristics; 97 %
were Caucasian. Of the study participants, nine IECR (24 %),
twelve IECR þ PF (32 %) and thirteen DER (33 %) participants
had insulin resistance at baseline defined as a HOMA score of
.2·5 unit (P¼0·71)(40), while six IECR (16 %), eight IECR þ PF
(21 %) and nine DER (23 %) met the revised harmonised cri￾teria for the metabolic syndrome (P¼0·65)(41). The majority
of the subjects reported previous attempts to the diet (IECR
86 %, IECR þ PF 90 % and DER 95 % of the participants), with
a comparable number of previous attempts between the
groups (IECR: median 2·0 (inter-quartile range 1·0–5·0);
IECR þ PF: median 2·0 (inter-quartile range 1·0–4·4); DER:
median 2·0 (inter-quartile range 1·0–5·0); P¼0·59).
In total, twenty-seven women withdrew from the study
(23 %): IECR n 4 (11 %), IECR þ PF n 10 (26 %) and DER
n 13 (33 %) (x2 ¼ 5·3, P¼0·071). The reasons for the dropout
were family/work issues (IECR n 3, IECR þ PF n 4 and
DER n 5), unrelated personal illness (IECR n 1, IECR þ PF
n 1 and DER n 1), problems adhering to the diet (IECR þ PF
n 2 and DER n 3) and loss to follow up (IECR þ PF n 3 and
DER n 4) (Fig. 1).
Effects of the diets during the 3-month
weight-loss period
Changes in insulin sensitivity and disease risk markers. At
3 months, the IECR group had significantly greater reductions
in serum insulin (P¼0·017) and HOMA (P¼0·02) from base￾line values compared with the DER group. Similar reductions
were also observed with the IECR þ PF group, but were not
significantly greater than with the DER group (insulin
P¼0·176) and HOMA P¼0·210; Table 2). Both IECR groups
experienced further acute reductions in insulin resistance
during their 2 d restriction. At 3 months, the median percentage
reduction in HOMA from immediately before their 2 d restric￾tion (after 5 d of the unrestricted diet) to the morning immedi￾ately after the 2 d restriction was 240 (interquartile range 262
to 245) % for the IECR group (n 6) and 227 (interquartile
range 214·5 to þ12) % for the IECR þ PF group (n 5)
(Fig. S1, available online). The concentration of HbA1c,
a measure of long-term plasma glucose concentrations, was
not significantly different between the three dietary groups.
At 3 months, all groups experienced small increases in the
levels of the ketone b-hydroxybutyrate when measured in
both plasma (Table 2) and urine samples (data not shown).
Plasma b-hydroxybutyrate was additionally elevated after the
2 d restriction. At 3 months, the median percentage increase
in b-hydroxybutyrate from before their 2 d restriction (after
5 d of the unrestricted diet) to the morning immediately after
the 2 d restriction was 31 (interquartile range 222 to þ75) %
for the IECR group (n 6) and 78 (interquartile range þ26 to
þ98) % for the IECR þ PF group (n 5) (Fig. S1, available
online). At 3 months, all dietary groups experienced compar￾able decreases in serum leptin, the leptin:adiponectin ratio,
reductions and the inflammatory marker IL-6 but no significant
changes in serum adiponectin, IGF-1, TNF-a or advanced oxi￾dation protein products (a measure of systemic oxidative
stress), when measured in plasma (Table 2) or urine samples
(data not shown). All groups experienced small and
comparable reductions in total and LDL-cholesterol and
TAG, maintenance of HDL-cholesterol, a small decrease in
the total:HDL-cholesterol ratio and reduced systolic and dias￾tolic blood pressure (Table 2). Both IECR diets evoked an
acute reduction in TAG. At 3 months, the median percentage
decrease from immediately before their 2 d restriction (after
5 d of the unrestricted diet) to the morning immediately after
the 2 d restriction for the IECR group was 26 (interquartile
range 232 to þ4) % (n 6) and for the IECR þ PF group 214
(inter-quartile range 228–11) %. The 2 d restriction did not
evoke consistent acute changes in any of the other metabolic
endpoints assessed in the study (Fig. S1, available online).
Changes in weight, adiposity and body circumferences.
The proportions of the three groups achieving 5 % or greater
weight loss at 3 months were 65 % (IECR), 58 % (IECR þ PF)
and 40 % (DER) (x2 ¼ 5·2, P¼0·076). Both IECR groups
experienced significantly greater and comparable reductions

in body fat than the DER group (IECR P¼0·007 and IECR þ PF
P¼0·019), but no significantly greater reductions in weight,
waist, hip and bust circumferences (Table 3). There were
small reductions in FFM in all the three groups. The median
percentage of weight lost, which was FFM, was less in the
IECR þ PF group (20·4 (95 % CI 13·2, 27·2) %) compared
with both IECR (36·0 (95 % CI 26·4, 41·3) %, P¼0·009) and
DER (29·3 (95 % CI 25, 38·1) %, P¼0·048) groups.
Dietary adherence
The mean percentage of the potential two restricted days
per week completed during the 3-month weight-loss period
was reported to be 76 (95 % CI 67, 85) % for the IECR group
and 74 (95 % CI 64, 84) % for the IECR þ PF group, with the
majority as two consecutive days (IECR 86 % and IECR þ PF
94 %) and the remainder as individual days.
Weekly average energy, carbohydrate, total fat, SFA and
alcohol intakes were reduced in all the diet groups (LOCF
analysis). The reductions in carbohydrate were greatest in
the IECR and IECR þ PF groups: on average, the IECR and
IECR þ PF groups both reduced carbohydrate by 43 % com￾pared with 23 % for the DER group. The IECR þ PF group
maintained higher intakes of protein and fat compared with
the other groups with, on average, an additional 10 g of
protein and 15 g of fat per d when estimated after 3 months
(Table S1, available online).
Both IECR groups were instructed to have a euenergetic diet
during the 5 d periods between the restrictions but, instead,
had a ‘carry-over effect’ of the reduced intake of energy and
carbohydrate on these non-restricted days, which was signifi￾cantly lower than the diet that we prescribed. At 3 months, the
mean energy intake for a ‘non-restricted’ day of the IECR
group was 5716 (95 % CI 5215, 6216) kJ compared with their
prescribed diet of 8314 (95 % CI 8080, 8540) kJ, on average
32 % less than prescribed. Likewise, the mean energy intake
for a non-restricted day of the IECR þ PF group was 6439
(95 % CI 5878, 7000) kJ compared with their prescribed diet
of 8458 (95 % CI 8193, 8722) kJ, on average 23 % less than pre￾scribed. The mean carbohydrate intakes on non-restricted
days of the IECR and IECR þ PF groups were 152·3 (95 % CI
135·1, 169·4) and 154·9 (95 % CI 139·1, 170·7) g, respectively,
compared with the prescribed 223·5 (95 % CI 217·2, 229·8)
and 227·4 (95 % CI 220·2, 234·5) g, both 32 % less than pre￾scribed (all P,0·001). The mean energy and carbohydrate
intakes on non-restricted days of the IECR and IECR þ PF
groups were actually comparable with the daily restricted
group, who had the mean daily intakes of 6126·7 (95 % CI
5575, 6678) kJ and 169·5 (95 % CI 155·1, 183·4) g carbohydrate
(both P¼1·00). Physical activity diaries documented minimal

changes in activity with no significant differences between the
three dietary groups (Table S1, available online).
Acceptability and safety of the diets
No major adverse effects were reported. A small number of
women in the three diet groups reported minor physical
symptoms such as feeling cold (DER 3 %), decreased energy
levels (IECR 5 % and DER 5 %), constipation (IECR 8 % and
DER 3 %), headaches (IECR 5 % and IECR þ PF 3 %), bad
breath on energy-restricted days (IECR 5 % and IECR þ PF
3 %), feeling light-headed (IECR 3 %), lack of concentration
(DER 3 %), mood swings or bad temper (IECR 3 % and
DER 5 %) and being preoccupied with food (IECR 8 %,
IECR þ PF 3 % and DER 3 %).
Average weekly hunger scores did not differ between the
three groups throughout the study. At 1 month, hunger and
desire-to-eat scores were marginally greater after the first
restricted day of IECR compared with the first restricted day
of IECR þ PF and an average DER day (both P,0·05). This
difference was no longer evident after 3 and 4 months, indicat￾ing that women had become used to the restriction (Table S2,
available online). All groups experienced comparable
reductions in Profile of Mood States questionnaire scores for
tension, depression, anger, fatigue and confusion, an increase
in vigour and an overall decline in total mood disturbance
(Table S3, available online).
All diets met requirements for B vitamins, vitamin E
and vitamin C, but indicated deficiencies in Mg, Fe, Zn, Ca,
vitamins A and D and fibre as commonly seen with energy￾reduced diets(42). The deficiency of Mg, Zn and Se was most
apparent in the IECR group, while inadequate fibre intake
was most apparent in the IECR and IECR þ PF groups
(Table S4(a) and (b), available online).
Weight maintenance period between 3 and 4 months
Mean adherence to the 1 d restriction during the weight main￾tenance month was 68 (95 % CI 50–85) % for the IECR group
and 68 (95 % CI 51–87) % for the IECR þ PF group. The
reductions in insulin resistance, weight, adiposity, circumfer￾ences, leptin, IL-6 and lipids were maintained during the
final weight maintenance month in all groups (Tables 2
and 3). Thus, 1 d of restriction per week maintained weight
loss and the reductions in disease risk markers in the short
term, similarly to the DER group who were asked to have
the recalculated euenergetic DER.
Discussion
The present randomised trial indicates that, in the short term,
the IECR diet is superior to the DER diet with respect to the
improvements in insulin sensitivity and the loss of body
fat. There were additional increases in insulin sensitivity
with IECR when measured at the end of the 2 d restriction,
although the significance of this additional effect is not clear.
Higher serum b-hydroxybutyrate indicates greater fat oxi￾dation during the 2 d restriction. IECR with ad libitum protein
and fat was tested in an attempt to increase acceptability.
The IECR þ PF diet achieved greater reductions in body fat
and a trend to improved insulin sensitivity both before and
after the 2 d restriction compared with the DER diet, but was
not more acceptable than the IECR diet.
The greater reduction in insulin resistance with the IECR v.
DER diet (5 d after restriction) in the present trial is consistent
with greater reductions in adiposity in the IECR group. Despite
the apparent comparable loss of body fat, the IECR þ PF
group had lesser reductions in insulin resistance. The reasons
for this are not known. The IECR þ PF diet was higher in pro￾tein, total fat and MUFA than the IECR diet (81 v. 71 g protein
per d). Much higher protein intakes (.140 g/d) have been
linked to increased insulin resistance, particularly alongside
low fibre intakes (15 g or less), possibly since amino acids
activate the protein ribosomal subunit serine kinase 6-1 that
phosphorylates and inhibits the downstream signalling of
the insulin receptor. The higher total fat (37 % energy) and
MUFA intake (14 % energy) with the IECR þ PF diet would
be expected to exert either a neutral or beneficial effect on
insulin sensitivity(43,44).
Both IECR diets included periods (approximately 60 h/week)
of profound energy and carbohydrate restriction (IECR: 265 %
energy and 285 % carbohydrate; IECR þ PF: 250 % energy
and 285 % carbohydrate) compared with the DER diet
(225 % energy and 230 % carbohydrate). These spells of
energy and carbohydrate restriction evoked acute reductions
in insulin resistance and TAG consistent with our previous
data for IER(22), which may be linked to acute reductions in
intrahepatic TAG content, improvements in hepatic insulin
sensitivity and reduced glucose production(45). The clinical sig￾nificance of repeated short spells of improved insulin sensitivity
is not known. None of the diets altered HbA1c, a longer-term
measure of glycaemia. Reduced HbA1c with weight loss has
not been consistently demonstrated in non-diabetic popu￾lations(46), and may not be sensitive enough to highlight
changes in the normoglycaemic population studied here.
Ketones increased during the restricted periods, indicating
a switch from glycogenolysis to fat oxidation which may be
beneficial, with a potential up-regulation of nuclear and mito￾chondrial sirtuins, reduced production of reactive oxidative
species and reduced accumulation of lipids in skeletal
muscle which may protect against metabolic and age-related
diseases(47,48).
Since IECR and DER have the same overall prescribed
energy restriction (25 %), and IECR þ PF seemingly a lesser
prescribed restriction (15 %), the question arises concerning
the mechanism of greater reductions in body fat with the
IECR and IECR þ PF diets compared with the DER diet. This
may be partly due to an apparent greater adherence to the
2 d of strict restriction with the IECR and IECR þ PF diets
than to the daily modest energy restriction in the DER
group. The present dietary record data show that the percen￾tage of potential restricted days completed during the first
month was comparable between the three groups. On aver￾age, the IECR and IECR þ PF groups completed 80 % of
their 2 d per week during the first month of the diet, while
the DER group achieved their 25 % energy restriction goal on
Intermittent v. daily energy restriction 1543

80 % of days within their 1 month food diary. By 3 months,
the IECR and IECR þ PF groups were still undertaking 70 %
of their potential restricted days, whereas the DER group
achieved their 25 % energy restriction goal on only 39 % of
days in their 3-month food diary. While not directly compar￾able, these estimated values highlight the well-documented
poor adherence to DER. Others have reported adherence to
DER on 40 % of potential days(49).
The success of both IECR diets is not only linked to the
adherence to the 2 d restriction, but is also attributable to
the spontaneous restriction of energy and carbohydrate on
non-restricted days. Intakes on these days in the IECR
groups were comparable with those of the DER group. This
is an important observation and confirms the present data
and the data of others which show that intermittent dieting
does not lead to disordered eating and overconsumption on
non-restricted days(21–23,50,51). This observation would need
to be replicated in future studies, but raises the intriguing
possibility that IER may be an effective way of achieving
short spells of greater restriction as well as a lesser restriction
for the remainder of the week.
The apparent comparable loss of body fat between the IECR
and IECR þ PF groups appears at odds with the higher
reported higher energy intake in the IECR þ PF group. Part
of this may be the slightly higher protein intake with
IECR þ PF (mean 1·2 (95 % CI 1·1, 1·2) g/kg body weight v.
mean 1·0 (95 % CI 0·9, 1·1) g/kg for the IECR group; mean 1·0
(95 % CI 0·9, 1·1) g/kg for the DER group; P¼0·08). Although
not significantly greater, higher protein intakes will help maxi￾mise the loss of fat and limit the loss of FFM for a given energy
restriction(52), and may evoke a small increase in energy expen￾diture and greater fat oxidation(53). Alternatively, the reported
higher energy intake with IECR þ PF may not actually be
higher, and could reflect biased under-reporting of carbo￾hydrate rather than protein foods(54), and thus inflate reported
intakes with the higher-protein IECR þ PF diet.
The reported 65 % success in producing 5 % weight loss
with IECR and 58 % with IECR þ PF is encouraging when
compared with the 40 % success with DER in the present
study and other studies(55). However, this is a short-term
study and possibly reflects greater adherence to the novel diet￾ary approach(56). Moreover, three previous short-term ran￾domised trials have tested IER v. DER, but unlike the
present study they showed no significant differences in
weight reduction between the two approaches(21–23). The
IER regimens tested here were carbohydrate restricted and
higher in protein and fat on restricted days to reduce feelings
of hunger(57), which we believe is key for adherence. Our
simple assessment of hunger suggests the 2 d IECR (65 %
energy restriction on restricted days) evoked a modest transi￾ent increase in hunger, but hunger did not increase with
IECR þ PF (50 % energy restriction on restricted days).
The IECR groups consumed carbohydrate on non-restricted
days, but did not overconsume, hence our IECR diets
were marginally lower in carbohydrate overall than the DER
diet. These differences were, however, quite modest with
the IECR and IECR þ PF groups receiving, respectively, 41
and 37 % of energy overall from carbohydrate compared
with 47 % in the DER group. These differences are unlikely
to account for the differences in the reductions of weight
and adiposity seen(9).
The tested IECR diets meet a number of micronutrient
requirements, i.e. thiamin, folic acid and vitamin C, known
to be deficient in daily low-carbohydrate diets(42). Suboptimal
fibre intake was a particular issue with both IECR diets. The
long-term implications of such a low fibre intake are not
known; however, comparable intakes found within daily mod￾erate carbohydrate-restricted diets (120–150 g/d) have
brought about long-term reductions in lipids, homocys￾teine(58) and the reversal of carotid atherosclerosis over
2 years without detectable adverse effects(27). Future IECR
diets should, however, be modified to maximise fibre intake
and promote foods rich in Ca, Mg, Fe and Se, which are con￾sidered preferable and more physiological than supplements(59),
and micronutrient status should be monitored.
Women on both IECR diets were counselled to limit SFA
intake, but to include MUFA and PUFA. We reported modest
reductions in total and LDL-cholesterol, rather than increased
LDL found with long-term high-SFA, low-carbohydrate
diets(60). We encouraged a range of lean meat, fish, vegetarian
and dairy protein foods in order to discourage high intakes
of red meat (.500 g/week), which have been, albeit incon￾sistently, linked to bowel cancer(61). The IECR þ PF diet
self-limited to 4776 kJ and was within healthy limits for protein
(i.e. ,125 g/d)(62) on restricted days and typically included
less than 300 g of red meat/week.
It is well known that maintenance of weight loss presents an
even greater challenge than initial weight loss. Including a
1-month weight maintenance period in the present study
gives some indication of the relative weight stabilisation
effects of the diets. The trial indicates that a 1 d IECR per
week was as effective as DER for maintaining reduced
weight and the potential metabolic benefits of weight loss.
However, this maintenance period is short and was within a
supervised research setting. Further investigation of longer
time periods is required.
Limitations
The 23 % dropout reported here is comparable with many
weight loss studies. We present an intention-to-treat analysis
based on LOCF. We considered an LOCF analysis the most
appropriate method and preferable to other multiple imputa￾tion techniques. Dropout from weight loss studies is well
known to be linked to poorer success. An LOCF analysis
allows all subjects to contribute data and accounts for this
potential bias. This would not be achieved using multiple
imputation techniques where dropouts are assumed to occur
randomly (i.e. observations are assumed to be missing at
random). Although randomisation was stratified according to
BMI, the IECR group had a lower baseline BMI than the
IECR þ PF (P¼0·05) and DER groups (P¼0·05), which could
potentially skew the present findings and partly explain their
better outcome. This, however, does not appear to be the
case, since baseline BMI did not predict success or dropout;
mean LOCF weight loss for women with a BMI above or

below 30 kg/m2 was 5·4 (SD 4·2) v. 5·3 (SD 4·6) % (P¼0·874).
The majority of outcomes were assessed by blinded person￾nel, although weight and anthropometric measures were
undertaken by research dietitians not blinded to the diet
group. Pre-menopausal women (48 % of the cohort) may
experience small cyclic variations in the levels of insulin,
lipids, leptin and IGF-1(63,64). We did not time biomarker
assessments in relation to the menstrual cycle and were
unable to adjust for the day of the cycle in the main analysis.
Body fat and FFM were assessed using bioelectrical
impedance. This method is prone to error where there are
fluctuations in body water content. However, under the stan￾dardised conditions that we used, impedance has been shown
to be a valid method for assessing change within weight loss
studies with good agreement with appropriate reference
methods of assessing body composition such as dual-energy
X-ray absorptiometry(65) and multi-compartment models(66).
Implications and future studies
Intermittent low energy and carbohydrate diets appear
feasible in our population of pre- and postmenopausal
women. The positive results of the present study warrant
further studies to test the veracity of the present short-term
results and the longer-term efficacy and safety of the IECR
approach and its applicability to other populations. No
single dietary approach will be appropriate and feasible for
all, and there is unlikely to be a panacea given the complexity
of weight management, but the addition of a further choice of
intervention may be helpful. In the present trial, eighteen
women (12 %) interested in taking part in the study could
not adhere to the IECR regimen in a pre-study test of
compliance and did not join the study, so the approach will
be problematic for some. The potential uptake to the IECR
regimen that allows ad libitum protein and fat may be greater
but was not assessed. IECR þ PF generally produced similar
results to IECR except there was a smaller reduction in insulin
resistance, but there was a marginally better nutritional profile
and a lower proportion of weight loss appeared to be FFM.
Further studies of both IECR and IECR þ PF regimens are war￾ranted to examine whether they could be a useful alternative
dietary intervention for weight-loss programmes.
