Abstract – Echinococcoses require the involvement of specialists from nearly all disciplines; standardization of the
terminology used in the field is thus crucial. To harmonize echinococcosis terminology on sound scientific and linguis￾tic grounds, the World Association of Echinococcosis launched a Formal Consensus process. Under the coordination of
a Steering and Writing Group (SWG), a Consultation and Rating Group (CRG) had the main missions of (1) providing
input on the list of terms drafted by the SWG, taking into account the available literature and the participants’ experi￾ence; and (2) providing independent rating on all debated terms submitted to vote. The mission of the Reading and
Review Group (RRG) was to give an opinion about the recommendation paper in terms of readability, acceptability
and applicability. The main achievements of this process were: (1) an update of the current nomenclature of Echino￾coccus spp.; (2) an agreement on three names of diseases due to Echinococcus spp.: Cystic Echinococcosis (CE),
Alveolar Echinococcosis (AE) and Neotropical Echinococcosis (NE), and the exclusion of all other names; (3) an
agreement on the restricted use of the adjective “hydatid” to refer to the cyst and fluid due to E. granulosus sensu lato;
and (4) an agreement on a standardized description of the surgical operations for CE, according to the “Approach, cyst
Opening, Resection, and Completeness” (AORC) framework. In addition, 95 “approved” and 60 “rejected” terms were
listed. The recommendations provided in this paper will be applicable to scientific publications in English and com￾munication with professionals. They will be used for translation into other languages spoken in endemic countries.
Key words: Cystic Echinococcosis, Alveolar Echinococcosis, Neotropical Echinococcosis: Echinococcus spp.,
Terminology, Formalized consensus.

Introduction
Echinococcus species (spp.) are parasites of the class
Cestoda and belong to the phylum Platyhelminthes; they cause
a variety of diseases in humans, most importantly cystic
echinococcosis (CE; also found in scientific publications and
professional/public communications under “hydatid cyst”, or
“hydatid disease”, “hydatidosis”, “echinococcus cysticus”,
etc.), alveolar echinococcosis (AE; also found under “alveococ￾cosis”, “echinococcus alveolaris”, “alveolar hydatid”, “alveolar
hydatidosis”, “alveolar hydatid disease”, “multilocular hydatid
cyst”, “multilocular hydatid disease”, “multilocular hydatido￾sis”, etc.), and neotropical echinococcosis (NE; also found
under “polycystic echinococcosis”, “polycystic hydatid dis￾ease”, “hydatidosis of the New World”, etc.) [35]. The simple
enumeration of the various alternative names of the diseases,
still in use in 2020, readily shows the absence of standardization
of the terminology used in this field. Echinococcoses are
zoonoses, and the complexity of the life cycle of the various
species of Echinococcus involved, the variety of their hosts,
as well as the impact of the diseases due to Echinococcus
spp. on public health, require the involvement of specialists
from nearly all disciplines (medicine and surgery, veterinary
medicine, zoology, parasitology, ecology, agriculture, public
health, economics, etc.) which have their own history and their
own jargon. However, they must cooperate to solve the multi￾ple problems of Echinococcus spp. infection, within the “One￾Health” concept. This makes the use of a common vocabulary
crucial. Time has thus come for standardization of the terminol￾ogy in the field of echinococcosis.
From Hippocrates, who first described the cysts in patients
more than 2400 years ago [18], to the 20th century, languages
of Greek and Latin origin have served to name the parasites/
diseases associated with Echinococcus spp. because in the
Western world, countries around the Mediterranean were the
known endemic regions for CE, the only recognized
Echinococcus-related disease [13]. In the 19th century, physi￾cians and researchers of German and Russian languages and in
the 20th century, of French and English languages [18] brought
new terms, and AE, then NE, were added to the list of
Echinococcus-related diseases. At the end of the 20th century,
China was recognized the main endemic region for CE and
AE. Meanwhile, publishing in English became more and more
common for physicians and scientists working in the field of
echinococcosis worldwide, and everyone had to work with the
variety of words and expressions describing Echinococcus spp.
and echinococcosis in international publications in English
[77]. Differences in wording, in the various professional environ￾ments, as well as in the various endemic countries, have become
sources of misunderstanding, with influences related to the local
language of the professionals.
The first decade of the 21st century, with the development
of molecular biology techniques and the complete elucidation
of the genomes of E. granulosus (Batsch, 1786) [87] and
E. multilocularis (Leuckart, 1863) [73], has seen the emergence
of new species within the genus Echinococcus, that have
increased and refined our taxonomic knowledge of these para￾sites; such developments have also had an impact on several
domains of echinococcosis research including not only geno￾mics, proteomics and metabolomics, but also immunology
and epidemiology [81, 86]. There has been and still is coexis￾tence of already defined species based on genetic sequences
with “types”, and “strains”, based on morphological character￾istics [55]. A better definition of the limits of the species has led
to an agreement between specialists on the definition and names
of the “new” species, and nine species are now recognized and
characterized by the sequences of their genomes, and defined in
terms of host species and endemic areas [81]. The application
of binomial nomenclature for genera and species is now
governed by various internationally agreed codes of rules, of
which the “International Code of Zoological Nomenclature
(ICZN)” governs the scientific designation of parasites (https://
www.iczn.org/the-code/the-international-code-of-zoological￾nomenclature/the-code-online/). This international system
must be followed, and any new species designation has to
be registered for its international use. However, the transla￾tion of the “new” Echinococcus species defined by specialists
into common usage by professionals has not yet been
achieved, and many publications still use “E. granulosus”
as a single species name responsible for CE.
The situation is also problematic for disease names and all
other terms and expressions. This may be due to the status of
echinococcoses as “orphan” diseases or “neglected diseases”
(e.g., for the World Health Organization they are now recog￾nized as “Neglected Tropical Diseases” (https://www.who.int/
neglected_diseases/diseases/en/), even though most human
cases and animal infections are not in tropical areas). For
“non-neglected” diseases, authoritative international scientific
societies have fixed the terminology and published recommen￾dations that are regularly updated. The World Federation of
Parasitologists has endorsed the Standardised Nomenclature
of Parasitic Diseases (SNOPAD), initially published in 1988
for animal parasitic diseases by the World Association for the
Advancement of Veterinary Parasitology, and has established
2 D.A. Vuitton et al.: Parasite 2020, 27, 41

rules for the names of parasitic diseases [32] (cf. https://www.
waavp.org/documents/snopad-guidelines/#.XS9gBvIza00).
The disease names are derived from the genus of the parasite
with a suffix in “-osis” (e.g., Echinococcus would give “echi￾nococcosis”). The rule is simple and clear; but the application
of this rule has not been consistently followed and, especially
for echinococcosis, coexistence of various names prevails,
with a subsequent impact on database searching and misun￾derstanding between researchers and professionals [33, 34].
Other terms used in the “echinococcosis field” are equally
ill-defined.
The “Asociación Internacional de Hidatidología” was
founded in 1941 in Colonia del Sacramento (Uruguay), during
the first “International South American Conference to Fight
against Hydatidosis”, aiming at coordinating echinococcosis
control, especially in the endemic countries of South America,
and organizing conferences. From 1951 to the end of the
1990s, Spanish, French and English were the official languages
of the biennial “World Congress of Hydatidology”, the main
activity of the “International Association of Hydatidology”
(IAE). At the 26th congress in Bucharest, Romania, in 2015,
the name of the association in English was officially changed
to “World Association of Echinococcosis (WAE)”, a formal step
towards the adoption of “echinococcosis” for the denomination
of the diseases (and of the field of research in general). In 1985,
the WHO Informal Working Group on Echinococcosis (IWGE)
was created, with the double aim of creating a network of
scientists working in basic sciences in the realm of echinococco￾sis, and in standardizing practices for the diagnosis and treat￾ment of Echinococcus spp. – related diseases, in line with the
priorities of the WHO [18].The group is currently working on
a Technical Manual to help clinicians in the care management
of patients with echinococcosis. Both professional entities
(IAE and IWGE) hold their main meeting at the same location
and have always joined efforts to issue manuals on echinococco￾sis including veterinary aspects, prevention and control [15–17],
or write and update guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of
patients with echinococcosis [10, 83]. In a plenary session of
the 27th World Congress of Echinococcosis (WCE) in Algiers,
Algeria, 2017, the need for harmonizing the terminology of
echinococcosis, on sound scientific and linguistic grounds,
was stressed; a working group and a consensus process were
established to provide recommendations applicable to scientific
publications in English, and to the communication between
professionals. Such recommendations should then be used as a
basis for translation into other languages spoken in endemic
countries for communication, teaching and training. This report
and its illustrations (Tables and Figures) and Appendix are the
ultimate result of the process.
Materials and methods
The methodology proposed to the participants in the
working groups established at the 27th WCE was the “Formal
consensus” approach, as used by the French “Haute Autorité de
Santé” (https://www.has-sante.fr/upload/docs/application/pdf/
2018-03/good_practice_guidelines_fc_method.pdf), inspired
by both the Delphi process [30] and the Consensus Conference
methods [19]. As the methodology was initially described to set
up guidelines for good clinical practices, the method was
slightly modified, as described below, to fit with the objectives
of the present work, i.e. an agreement on terminology and good
publishing practices. All participants in the various groups
involved in the “formal consensus” process are cited as “asso￾ciated authors” in the final publication (names in Appendix).
Definition and modalities of constitution
of the Working Groups
Steering and Writing Group (SWG)
The mission of the SWG was: (1) to draft the list of words
and expressions, and provide a critical analysis of their scienti￾fic and linguistic relevance, from the international scientific
literature and all available sources (international nomenclature,
international recommendations, historical notes, etymology),
and submit it to the participants in the Consultation and Rating
Group (CRG); (2) to collect and discuss the feedback from the
participants in the CRG, and if necessary to submit difficult
cases to appropriate external experts; (3) to draft the final lists
of words and expressions and submit them to rating by the par￾ticipants in the CRG; (4) to select 12 experts in the various dis￾ciplines of interest to the field of echinococcosis, not involved
in the CRG, as members of the Reading and Review Group
(RRG); (5) to analyze the rating data and draft the initial version
of the Recommendation Paper, including the final tables with
recommended terminology, to be submitted to the RRG;
(6) to consider the remarks of the RRG on the draft, finalize
the paper and the tables with the members of the CRG, and sub￾mit it to the appropriate journal; and (7) to ensure the follow-up
of the paper and the dissemination of its content to end-users.
The composition of the SWG, chaired by a project manager,
was approved by the president and the members of the WAE
attending the 27th WCE, and three topics of interest were pro￾posed, each coordinated by two members of the SWG, experts
in the area.
Consultation and Rating group (CRG)
The mission of the CRG in the “formal consensus” process
was (1) in the first step of consultation, to provide input on the
initial list of terms and expressions drafted by the SWG, taking
into account the available literature in all fields and the personal
experience of the various participants; (2) in the second step of
consultation, to participate in the poll, and provide independent
rating on all words and expressions submitted to vote by the
SWG; and (3) to finalize the text of the paper with the SWG
after its evaluation by the RRG, and before its submission to
the appropriate journal.
Sub-groups, corresponding to the three topics of interest
were composed on a voluntary basis at the 27th WCE, and
completed after a call for volunteering launched by email by
the SWG after the congress. On their request, participants could
belong to more than one subgroup. The list of the CRG parti￾cipants who were involved in the whole process, and their
country/countries of residence and field work, is provided in
the Appendix. For the “Species and epidemiology”, “Biology
and immunology” and “Clinical aspects” subgroups of the
D.A. Vuitton et al.: Parasite 2020, 27, 41 3

CRG, 17, 18, and 14 participants were identified, respectively
from 15 countries in total. The project manager coordinated
all activities of the groups but was not involved in any rating;
however, other members of the SWG who volunteered for
the task could be involved in rating but only for those sub￾groups they were not coordinating.
Reading and Review Group (RRG)
The mission of the RRG, multidisciplinary and multi￾professional, was to give a formal opinion on the content and
form of the initial version of the paper and the recommenda￾tions it may contain, especially in terms of applicability, accept￾ability, and readability in their own domain. According to the
rules of the “formal consensus” process, the participants in
the RRG would offer an advisory opinion on an individual
basis, without de novo questioning the decisions from the votes
obtained in the first 2 steps of the process. The list of the RRG
participants (four experts for each topic) who were involved in
the reviewing process, and their country/countries of residence
and field of expertise, is given in the Appendix.
Schedule of the process
The time schedule of the process, from October 2017 to
February 2020, is given in Figure 1. The main steps included:
(1) constitution of the SWG, presentation of the project, and
constitution of the CRG; (2) provision of a list of words and
expressions, with arguments for their acceptance or rejection,
provided by the SWG to the participants in the CRG; (3) input
from the participants in the CRG and open discussion; (4) con￾stitution of the RRG by the SWG; (5) a preliminary summary
by the SWG, and preparation of three lists of words and expres￾sions for each of the three topics, according to three levels of
decision: (a) a priori approved terms, (b) a priori rejected
terms, (c) debated issues submitted to vote; (6) vote on “debated
issues” by the participants in the CRG; (7) analysis of data and
drafting of the Recommendation Paper by the SWG;
(8) reviewing of the draft by the RRG; (9) last review by the
CRG; (10) submission of the manuscript by the SWG; and
(11) follow-up of the publication process and dissemination
of the recommendations by the SWG.
Except for the first kick-off meeting at the 27th WCE and
the final presentation at the 28th WCE in Lima, Peru, and given
the worldwide extent of the consultation group and absence of
funding, there were no further face-to-face meetings; all discus￾sions and exchanges were managed by email. The project
manager and members of the SWG answered all messages sent
by the members of the CRG and all contributions were taken
into account at any stage.
Analysis of the poll
Medians and means of the ratings, on a possible agreement
range from 1 to 10, were calculated for the answers to each ques￾tion. A majority of agreement for approval or rejection was con￾sidered when more than half of the ratings were equal to or
higher than 5, or equal to or lower than 5, respectively. Unani￾mous approval or rejection was defined as ratings higher than or
lower than 5 for all voters, respectively. Agreement for rejection
was defined for a median equal to 3.5 or lower, and majority or
unanimity of ratings; agreement for approval was defined for a
median equal to 7.5 and higher; and majority or unanimity of
ratings. A question was deemed “undecided” when the median
was between 3.5 and 7.5 and/or there was no majority of ratings.
After the poll and when needed, i.e. whenever the result of the
votes was “undecided” and/or whenever there was no full
agreement on the definition of a term, the SWG submitted the
term/expression to further discussion between specialists in
order to reach final agreement. To this purpose, subgroups of
specialists (e.g., surgeons) were constituted to propose final
agreement.

Results
Final composition of the CRG subgroups
For the “Species and epidemiology” subgroup, 1 participant
could not be reached by email and 1 never answered emails; the
final rating was thus provided independently by 15 participants,
from 10 countries. For the “Biology and immunology” sub￾group, three participants could not be reached; five participants
from the same research team worked together for the final
rating; thus the final rating was provided independently by
11/15 participants from 11 countries. For the “Clinical aspects”
subgroup, one participant could not be reached and one did not
answer emails; 2 participants from the same research group
worked together for the final rating; thus the final rating was
provided by 11/12 participants from 8 countries.
Results of the first stage of consultation
The first stage of consultation generated numerous com￾ments with associated arguments and references from all parti￾cipants in the CRG. This input was carefully collated in a
summary version of the preliminary tables by the SWG. In case
of need, other experts of the specific field were consulted by the
coordinators of the subgroups, and their opinion was brought to
the attention of the CRG participants. The synthetic tables as
well as additional pictures if necessary (especially for the sub￾group on “Biology and immunology”), were again sent to all
participants to obtain initial evaluation of possible consensus,
and set up a list of still “debated issues”.
For the “Species and epidemiology” subgroup, it was agreed
that the nomenclature of old and new species of Echinococcus
should follow the rules of the ICZN. Thus, the names of the
species (and their number) listed in the tables reflect the results
of current taxonomic research and do not preclude future
changes, provided these are based on convincing new evidence.
There was also a consensus on the use of the “G” genotypes in
cases where genetic differences are apparent, but where – based
on current knowledge – these differences are deemed too small
to warrant recognition of the variants as named taxa. In addition,
the term “genotype” should be reserved for characterization
using molecular biology/sequencing, and “strain” or “type”
should be reserved for characterization using morphological
and host-range characteristics. Consequently, there were no
“debated issues” for this subgroup. However, definitions and
clarifications on species names and on other words and expres￾sions regarding this topic were given in provisional tables; they
were submitted for approval or rejection in the second stage of
the process (with an answer of the “YES/NO” type).
For the “Biology and immunology” subgroup, there was far
more debate since there is no official institution in charge of such
terminology. Divergences appeared about the various stages of
development of the Echinococcus spp. in their intermediate
hosts, and particularly on the definition of the term metacestode.
Other minor divergences were noted on the use of certain words
to designate the cells and components of these parasites, either
adult or larval, as well as the host’s reaction. References were
provided by parasitology and immunology specialists to support
data interpretation, thus the use of specific words. From that
stage of the consultation, there was general agreement that the
adjective “hydatid” should only be used for E. granulosus sensu
lato; as this was a sensitive issue, it was however kept in the
“debated issues” submitted to vote, both for the “Biology and
immunology” and for the “Clinical aspects” subgroups. For
details on the names of the various components of the egg of
all Echinococcus spp. and of the cyst in CE, it was decided to
provide a figure that would fix the definitions of the various
words (Figs. 2A, 2B and 2C). The definition of “cyst” was initi￾ally the main disagreement between “parasitologists” (2-layer
cyst) and “clinicians” (3-layer cyst). At the end of the first stage,
it was finally agreed by all experts, whatever their field of
expertise, that all cysts due to Echinococcus spp. and, especially
for clinicians, those due to E. granulosus s.l., included two
“layers” (and not “membranes”) of parasite origin and one layer
of host origin, thus three layers. This clarification helped when
defining several derived terms.
For the “Clinical aspects” subgroup, it was readily agreed
that the names of diseases due to the various species of
Echinococcus should follow the rules proposed by the
SNOPAD and the generic name “echinococcosis” should
always be used, irrespective of the species and type of disease.
“Cystic” and “Alveolar” should be used as adjectives to desig￾nate the diseases due to E. granulosus (Batsch, 1786) sensu
lato, and to E. multilocularis (Leuckart, 1963), respectively.
Some discussion remained for the use of the adjective “hyda￾tid”, and for the names of the diseases due to E. oligarthra
(Diesing, 1863) and E. vogeli Rausch and Bernstein, 1972, in
South America. Most of the debated issues concerned the
names of therapeutic interventions (surgical or using other tech￾niques); however, the common definition of “cyst”, shared by
parasitologists and clinicians, led to an easier consensus on
the meaning of “cystectomy”.
Results of the second stage of consultation
Agreement for approval or rejection
A few terms proposed in the lists for “approval” or “rejec￾tion” at the end of the first stage of the process still received
objections from participants in the CRG. More precision (or
references) were provided in order to reach a final consensus
on these terms and their definition. Approved terms were pro￾visionally included in Tables 1A (Genetics and epidemiology),
1B (Biology and immunology) and 1C (Clinical aspects).
Rejected terms were provisionally included in Tables 2A
(Genetics and epidemiology), 2B (Biology and immunology)
and 2C (Clinical aspects).
Poll on debated issues
Among the 39 final participations in the poll about “debated
issues” nine were incomplete; the questionnaire was sent back
to these participants for completion; precise answers were even￾tually obtained. The ratings provided for the poll on “debated
issues” were analyzed in order to obtain means and medians,
and thus a final score for approval or rejection of each term.
Results of the median rating for the “debated terms”, and when￾ever useful the agreement between participants, are given in the
“Comments” column of Tables 1A–1C and 2A–2C. Objections
and concerns on the use of some terms were re-discussed by
D.A. Vuitton et al.: Parasite 2020, 27, 41 5

specialists before making a final decision on their final rejection
or approval, and minor modifications in the wording of defini￾tions were made in order to obtain a final consensus. An impor￾tant result of the poll, since it was distinctly and clearly agreed
upon both by the participants in the “Biology and immunology”
subgroup and those in the “Clinical aspects” subgroup, was on
the word “hydatid”. According to the polls, all names of
diseases or operations composed from the radical “hydatid”
(e.g., in “hydatid-osis” or “hydatid-ectomy”, etc.) should be
abandoned, and the adjective “hydatid”, whenever used, should
never be used to qualify entities different from those due to
E. granulosus sensu lato, thus never be used for E. multilocularis,
E. vogeli and E. oligarthra. A final discussion on the charac￾terization of the surgical procedures aimed at removing
CE cysts eventually retained a simple framework that should
be used whenever surgical operations are described in
publications, with four levels of mandatory qualification,
regarding (1) Approach: “laparotomy”, “laparoscopy” or
“robotic”; (2) Cyst Opening: “non-opened cyst” (NOP)
versus “opened-cyst” (OP); (3) Resection type: “cystectomy”,
“hepatectomy”, or “liver transplantation”; and (4) Complete￾ness of resection: “total”, “subtotal”, and “partial”. Description
of the AORC unified framework for surgical interventions in
CE is given in Figures 3A and 3B. Precise description of the
procedure actually performed should complete the mandatory
terms (description of the removed parasite layers, area in
square centimetres or percentage of cyst actually resected,
closure of communications with bile ducts, etc.).
Review by the RRG and meeting at the 28th WCE
in Lima, Peru
Feedback from the RRG members usually addressed minor
aspects of text readability and/or definitions/descriptions in the
Tables. Clarification was provided by the reviewers on the
definition of the species and their hosts, especially regarding
species involved in NE. The major issues raised by one
reviewer (clinician) concerned the definition of the “cyst”,

and the retention of the adjective “hydatid”, even in its very
restrictive sense as described in Tables 1B and 1C. However,
because of the clear results of the consensus process, these
objections could not be taken into account in the final version.
At the meeting of the WHO-IWGE held in Lima, Peru, during
the 28th WCE, the still debated issues were raised and final
adjustments were made between the SWG and the writers of
the WHO-IWGE Technical Manual on CE treatment. Words
and expressions finally approved and rejected after the poll
and the last discussions were added to the list of approved
and rejected terms. Terms finally approved (95 items) are thus
included in Tables 1A (Genetics and epidemiology), 1B
(Biology and immunology) and 1C (Clinical aspects). Rejected
terms (60 items) are included in Tables 2A, (Species and
epidemiology), 2B (Biology and immunology) and 2C
(Clinical aspects). To facilitate consultation, Tables 1A–1C
and 2A–2C are organized by topics of interest (A, B and C),
and within each topic, in alphabetic order of the words or
expressions.
Discussion
This 2-year multidisciplinary and international exchange of
views has allowed physicians, veterinarians and basic science
researchers to freely discuss opinions about terms used in all
fields relating to Echinococcus spp., and to reach a consensus
on the use of the most appropriate ones, based on sound scien￾tific and/or linguistic grounds. When evidence was not avail￾able, consensus was based on reasoned arguments, including
usage when no suitable alternative was found, confirmed by a
poll. This is the first and only endeavour of this type in the
domain of echinococcosis; and it is endorsed by the WAE.
Definitions of 155 terms and expressions and recommendations
provided in Tables 1A–1C and 2A–2C and Figures 2A–2C and
3 should be followed in the future by all scientists writing scien￾tific papers in English; scientific editors and referees/reviewers
should recommend article authors to use the approved terms.
These recommendations should help the recognized experts,
involved in scientific work on echinococcosis at the interna￾tional level, to set up a similar list of recommended and rejected
words in their country language(s), so that similar wording
could be used by all professionals. Major advances promoted
by the multidisciplinary work on echinococcosis terminology
were: (1) the confirmation of the current recognition of nine
species of Echinococcus; (2) an agreement on the names of
the three types of diseases due to Echinococcus spp. and rejec￾tion of all others; (3) the restriction of the adjective “hydatid” to
E. granulosus s.l.; and (4) the proposal of the “AORC” frame￾work to describe surgical interventions in CE.

The participants involved in the work were representative of
the “echinococcosis” scientific community. Half of the 61 parti￾cipants in the three working groups belonged to the top 50
experts in the area (as cited from their publications retrieved with
the key words “echinococcosis”: http://expertscape.com/ex/
echinococcosis or “hepatic echinococcosis”: http://expertscape.
com/ex/echinococcosis%2C+hepatic). Health professionals
and young researchers were also involved in the CRG; there
was a balanced proportion of researchers and professionals.
The participants in the three groups were from 15 endemic coun￾tries, and all five continents were represented with a balance of
male and female contributors to the debate. Recruitment of the
participants in the CRG at the 27th WCE on a volunteer basis
enabled researchers and professionals from the Maghreb and
Middle East countries, highly endemic countries for CE, to
participate in the CRG.
Figure 3. “AORC” nomenclature framework for CE surgery. (A) (top) – Vocabulary and acronyms. AORC: acronym for Approach,
Opening, Resection and Completeness; CE: cystic echinococcosis; OC: opened cyst; NOC: non-opened cyst. (B) (bottom) – A. Schematic
structure of CE cyst: the CE cyst consists (from inside to outside) of the germinal layer, laminated layer and adventitial layer. B. Total
cystectomy requires the resection of all three layers completely. C. Subtotal cystectomy requires the nearly total resection of all three layers;
only parts of the adventitial layer are preserved because of surgical safety. D. Partial cystectomy refers to the incomplete resection of any of
three layers (usually of the adventitial layer) due to technical and safety issue. E. Hepatectomy requires the en bloc resection of part of liver
parenchyma, following the rules of hepatic resection.

Echinococcus
Rudolphi, 1801
(Cestoda: Taeniidae)
Genus in the family
Taeniidae Ludwig, 1886,
order Cyclophyllidea,
class Cestoda, phylum
Platyhelminthes,
kingdom Animalia.
International nomenclature; name
of the genus Echinococcus [67]; must
be written in italics with first letter in
capital letter; abbreviation “E.”
(italics followed by a dot) when in
a binomen (i.e. a generic name
and a specific name) or in a trinomen
(a generic name, a specific name and
a subspecific name – this is rare).
The genus name Alveococcus (for the
species Alveococcus multilocularis
(Leuckart, 1863) Abuladze, 1959) was
erected to separate E. multilocularis
from the other species. There is no
longer a taxonomic basis for such a
separation, but the name is still used
occasionally, particularly in Russian
literature. See also Table 2A.
Echinococcus sp. One species within
the genus
Echinococcus.
The abbreviation “sp.” (not italics)
stands for a species, the identity of
which is not known (e.g. in case of an
undetermined Echinococcus isolate)
Echinococcus spp. More than one (or all)
species within the
genus Echinococcus.
The abbreviation “spp.” does not
indicate a species with the taxonomic
definition of “species”, but stands for
“species pluralis” (the Latin for
“multiple species”), hence the roman
letters (not italics).
spp is followed by a dot (because it is
the abbreviation of a Latin expression;
see e.g., i.e., as examples), thus: “spp.”
Echinococcus
canadensis
(Webster &
Cameron,
1961)
A species within the
E. granulosus sensu lato
species cluster.
E. canadensis (Webster & Cameron,
1961) [80] corresponds to the previous
“G6/G7”, “G8” and “G10” genotypes,
identified by DNA sequencing [52]
(see GenBank: https://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/genbank/); E. canadensis
belongs to E. granulosus s.l.
Genotypes may be used to differentiate
between distinct molecular sequences,
within the defined species; the word
“strain” should no longer be used.
E. canadensis cycle may involve camels
and goats (G6 genotype), pigs (G7) and
cervids (G8 and G10) as intermediate
hosts and dogs (as well as wolves for
G8 and G10) as definitive hosts;
however, sheep, cattle and other
ungulates may also be infected by
E. canadensis, which is the second
species within E. granulosus s.l., after
E. granulosus s.s., to infect humans.
G6 and G7 may in future be separated
from this species, so at present the
expression “E. canadensis cluster”
is recommended.
Echinococcus
equinus (Williams &
Sweatman, 1963)
A species within the
E. granulosus sensu
lato species cluster.
E. equinus (Williams & Sweatman,
1963) [84] corresponds to the previous
“G4” genotype, identified by DNA
sequencing [52] (see GenBank: https://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/).
E. equinus belongs to E. granulosus
s.l. [66]
E. equinus cycle usually involves
members of the horse family as
intermediate hosts and dogs as
definitive hosts. It is also known
from a wildlife cycle involving lions
and zebras [9, 78].
It is associated with disease in non￾human primates (lemurs) [9, 12].
However, the zoonotic potential of
E. equinus infection (i.e. infection in
humans) has not yet been convincingly
demonstrated [2].
Echinococcus
felidis Ortlepp,
1937
A species within the
E. granulosus sensu
lato species cluster.
E. felidis Ortlepp, 1937 [59], was first
described as such in 1937 by Ortlepp
from the lion, Panthera leo, in South
Africa; it is now recognized as a distinct
species, identified by DNA sequencing
[52] (see GenBank: https://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/genbank/collab/); E. felidis
belongs to E. granulosus s.l. [26]
E. felidis cycle involves lions as
definitive hosts, and it is only known
from warthogs and hippos as
intermediate hosts; E. felidis infection
has not been recognized to be associated
with disease in humans up to now [25].

Echinococcus
granulosus
(Batsch, 1786)
sensu lato
The concept of E. granulosus
as one species cluster that
contains all agents of cystic
echinococcosis.
“sensu lato” and “sensu stricto”
are used, when a species name
(here: E. granulosus (Batsch,
1786)) [7] is used in different
concepts: in a wider sense (s.l.)
that includes e.g. cryptic
species, or in a more restricted
concept (s.s.) [52].
“sensu lato” should be in italics
(although this is debated), without
capital letters as first letters. The
abbreviation of each word in
“sensu lato” is followed by a
dot (because it is the abbreviation
of Latin words; see e.g., i.e.,
as examples), thus: “s.l.”
“granulosus” should be followed by “sensu
lato” whenever the precise species has not
been determined.
For publications on the clinical aspects of
echinococcosis, as the clinical descriptions
of the disease “cystic echinococcosis”(CE)
fits with all those species within
E. granulosus sensu lato that are
responsible for disease in humans, the use
of E. granulosus sensu lato is allowed
when there was no identification of the real
species. For publications on basic research
and epidemiology, molecular identification
of the real species is necessary; it should be
performed and indicated in the Materials
and Methods section.
Echinococcus
granulosus
(Batsch, 1786)
sensu stricto
A species within the
E. granulosus sensu lato
species cluster.
“sensu stricto” and “sensu lato”
are used, when a species name
(here: E. granulosus (Batsch,
1786)) [7] is used in different
concepts: in a wider sense
(s.l.) that includes e.g. cryptic
species, or in a more restricted
concept (s.s.) [52, 66].
E. granulosus sensu stricto corresponds to
the previous “G1”, “G2”, a microvariant of
“G3”, and “G3” genotypes, identified by
DNA sequencing (see GenBank: https://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/); its cycle
usually involves sheep as intermediate
hosts and dogs as definitive hosts; cattle
and other ungulates may also be infected by
E. granulosus sensu stricto
A strongly diverging genotype from Africa
(“G Omo”) is provisionally retained in
E. granulosus s.s., but will have to be
reclassified in the future [79].
“sensu stricto”, which is the
equivalent of a species, should
be in italics (although this is debated),
without capital letters as first letters.
The abbreviation of each word in
“sensu stricto” is followed by a dot
(because it is the abbreviations
of Latin words; see e.g., i.e., as examples),
thus: “s.s.” E. granulosus s.s. belongs to
E. granulosus s.l. [66]
Echinococcus
multilocularis
(Leuckart, 1863)
A species in the genus
Echinococcus.
E. multilocularis (Leuckart, 1863)
[50], is the agent of the disease
“alveolar echinococcosis” (AE)
in humans [35, 52]
E. multilocularis was clearly distinguished
from E. granulosus sensu lato in the middle
of the 20th century [18, 77]. It involves a
variety of rodents and lagomorphs as
intermediate hosts depending on the
geographical area, humans as accidental
intermediate hosts, and various species of
foxes, dog and wolf as definitive hosts. The
disease caused by E. multilocularis,
characterized by lesions composed of an
aggregate of microcysts embedded in a
granulomatous host’s reaction, is distinct
from that caused by E. granulosus s.l. as
well as those caused by E. vogeli and
E. oligarthra.
Since then, no major genetic polymorphism
has been found within E. multilocularis
that would distinguish new species or even
strains. For phylogeographic studies
(variability at a continental scale), genetic
polymorphism within the micro-satellite
EmSB may be used [42].

Echinococcus
oligarthra
(Diesing, 1863)
A species in the
genus Echinococcus.
E. oligarthra (Diesing, 1863) [14]
is a species found in South,
Central and North America
(Mexico) [52, 58].
The component “arthra”,
originally proposed by
Diesing, comes from the ancient
Greek ;
aqhqa  –arthra (joints) which
is the plural of ;
aqhq  om -arthron
(joint). The name is therefore
not an adjective, but a noun in
apposition, which does not change
its ending according to the
gender of the generic name.
This was recognized earlier but
subsequently ignored.
E. oligarthra cycle usually involves agouti
(Dasyprocta spp.) and occasionally paca
(Cuniculus paca), spiny rats (Proechimys
spp.), rabbits (Sylvilagus floridanus), and
opossums (Didelphis marsupialis) as
intermediate hosts and various wild cat
species as definitive hosts [65].
It is responsible for a disease in humans
distinct from cystic and alveolar
echinococcosis, sometimes wrongly called
“polycystic echinococcosis” (since it
usually presents as a single cyst) [35].
“Neotropical echinococcosis” is the
expression recommended to qualify human
infection due either to E. vogeli or to
E. oligarthra. See also Table 1C
E. ortleppi
Lopez-Neyra
& Soler Planas,
1943
A species within the
E. granulosus sensu
lato species cluster.
E. ortleppi Lopez-Neyra & Soler
Planas, 1943 [51] corresponds to
the previous “G5” genotype,
identified by DNA sequencing
[1, 52, 66] (see GenBank)
E. ortleppi cycle usually involves cattle as
intermediate hosts and dogs as definitive
hosts; other ungulates may also be infected
by E. ortleppi [24]. Human cases are
known, but rare [13, 24].
E. shiquicus
Xiao, Qiu, Nakao,
Li, Yang, Chen,
Schantz,
Craig & Ito, 2005
A species in the
genus
Echinococcus.
E. shiquicus Xiao et al., 2005
[85] is a species phylogenetically
close to E. multilocularis [52]
which was identified in the
county of Sêrx€u (in Tibetan,
石渠县 in Mandarin Chinese (pinyin:
Shíqú Xiàn)) in Sichuan province,
Qinghai-Tibet plateau region of
Western PR China
E. shiquicus (pronunciation “seshüicus”)
infection has not been recognized to be
associated with disease in humans up to
now [35].
E. vogeli Rausch &
Bernstein, 1972
A species in
the genus
Echinococcus.
E. vogeli Rausch & Bernstein, 1972
[62] is an Echinococcus species
found only in South and
Central America.
E. vogeli natural cycle mainly involves
paca (Cuniculus paca) as intermediate
hosts; it has also been documented in other
rodents such as agouti (Dasyprocta spp.),
and the bush dog (Speothos venaticus) and
domestic dogs as definitive hosts [65];
E. vogeli is responsible for a disease in
humans distinct from cystic and alveolar
echinococcosis, often called “polycystic
echinococcosis”, because of the
presentation of the disease [35].
“Neotropical echinococcosis” is the
expression recommended to qualify the
human infection due either to E. vogeli or
to E. oligarthra: see also Table 1C.
G genotypes Genotypes identified
within the species
E. granulosus s.l.,
previously identified
as “strains”.
Genotypes may be used to
differentiate between distinct
molecular sequences, within the
defined species or complexes;
the word “strain” should no longer
be used when genetic characterization
has been performed [52, 55].
Further definition of new species is still
possible. Waiting for such definitions,
G genotypes should be kept, in addition to
the current species name, if necessary.

Comments
*Aborted
(cyst, lesion),
Adjective
Non-viable parasitic structure as
evidenced by imaging (complete
calcification in AE, CE5 cyst in
CE) or histological examination
(absence of viable parasitic cells).
Could be used in clinical or
experimental situations when
evidence of absence of
viability is not obtained by
transplantation or in vitro
culture.
Distinct from “non-viable”; the
definition was approved unanimously
by the voters; the adjective “aborted”
was preferred to the alternative
“died-out” by the majority of voters
(median: 10).
*Adult form,
Expression
Sexual reproduction stage of
Echinococcus spp. parasites in
their definitive hosts.
More popular alternative expression
to the specific scientific expression
“strobilar stage” to designate this
step in the development of
Echinococcus spp. cestodes;
expression coherent with “larval
form” in the intermediate hosts.
“Adult” may include all stages of
development in the
definitive host (fertile or immature
worms i.e. with the last segment
containing eggs
or not).
This expression with its definition was
approved by the majority of voters
(median: 10)
*Adventitial
layer,
Expression
Partly cellular and fibrous
layer of host origin surrounding the
inner 2 layers of parasite origin
(germinal and laminated layers) of
the metacestode in the intermediate
host of
E. granulosus sensu lato.
The expression was approved
in order to have a coherent
denomination of the various “layers” of
the hydatid cyst, irrespective of their
origin (parasite or host).
“Adventitia” was an alternative term; it
was rejected by voters (median: 2). The
expression “adventitial layer” with its
definition was approved by the majority
of voters (median: 10)
As for “germinal membrane”
and “laminated membrane”,
the use of the expression “adventitial
membrane” is
not relevant.
The correct description of the parasitic
structures in the intermediate host thus
includes 3 similar expressions, from
inside to outside:
– Germinal layer
– Laminated layer
– Adventitial layer

G1 and G3 genotypes Genotypes individualized
within E. granulosus
sensu stricto.
The word “genotype” should be
used; it is more appropriate than
“strain” since it is based on
genotyping and not on other
techniques (especially morphological)
previously used to distinguish
between strains [52, 55].
Keeping the distinction between genotypes
may be necessary for phylogeographic
studies and in some circumstances for
echinococcosis control (targeting animal
hosts and specific cycles) [38, 41]. Best
target for identification of G1 and G3
seems to be the nad5 gene region [39].
G1 is the most common genotype in sheep;
G2 was first described as “Tasmanian
sheep strain” but is actually cosmopolitan;
G3 was initially identified from water
buffalo, but is now also known from other
intermediate hosts.
G2 is considered a microvariant of G3 [40].
G6/G7 G8 G10 Genotypes
individualized
within E. canadensis
(Webster &
Cameron, 1961).
Pending further distinction between
accepted species, genotypes within
E. canadensis should be qualified by the
previously accepted “G” numbers
G6/G7, G8 and G10 [49, 66].
G9 is no longer recognized as a distinct
genotype; it is probably a microvariant of
G7; the genotypic cluster G6/7 is the
second most important agent of human CE
worldwide; further distinction between
species within the E. canadensis cluster has
been proposed, but has not been accepted
yet [48, 53, 54, 57].
Genotypes may be used to differentiate
between distinct molecular sequences,
within the defined species; the word
“strain” should no longer be used.

*Border
(periparasitic),
Noun
For both E. granulosus s.l. and
E. multilocularis, structures that
surround the laminated layer,
at the border with the organ
parenchyma.
Alternative term to
“boundary”
The use of “boundary” was rejected by
all voters but one.
The noun “border” with its definition
was approved by the majority of voters
(median: 10).
Brood
capsule,
Expression
Element budding from
the germinal layer
which produces protoscoleces.
No synonyms. In some publications, some confusion
may be found with “daughter cysts”.
The 2 entities are totally different in
their origin and their components (see
Figs. 2A–2C).
*Cyst
(echinococcal
or hydatid),
Noun
Anatomical entity produced by
the growth of the metacestode of
Echinococcus spp. distinct from the
surrounding organ parenchyma and
filled with fluid, which includes
(from outside to inside)
– Adventitial layer (of host origin,
even reduced to a few infiltrating
cells or to fibrous tissue)
– Laminated layer (of parasite
origin)
Germinal layer (of parasite
origin)
– Cyst fluid (and its content, of both
parasite and host origin).
The word “cyst” should be reserved to
the clinical (or experimental) situation
in CE (“hydatid” cyst) or NE; it may be
observed by a variety of imaging
techniques such as ultrasound imaging,
computed tomography, or magnetic
resonance imaging.
The international classification of CE
cysts is based on ultrasound imaging
with 5 CE stages [82]
Two types of CE3 cysts (a and b) are
now described [10, 31].
Should never be used to designate the
central necrotic cavity often developed
in the AE lesions. “Pseudocyst” should
be used for this cavity.
All voters supported the restriction of
the noun “cyst” to CE or NE, in the
context of echinococcosis (median: 10).
*Cyst fluid,
Expression
Liquid secreted by the germinal
layer of Echinococcus spp. larval
form and collected at the center of
the “cyst” (for E. granulosus s.l.) or
of the “microcysts” (for
E. multilocularis).
Should be reserved for in vivo
situations: cysts in CE, and NE, and
microcysts of AE in human and animal
hosts, including experimental models.
The distinction between “vesicle fluid”
and “cyst fluid” was approved by all
voters (median: 10); they also approved
the use of “cyst” for the in vivo situation
only.
*Echinococcal,
Adjective
Adjective proposed to qualify
anything relating to all
Echinococcus spp. irrespective
of the species, of the pathology, or
of the clinical presentation of the
disease that occurs in humans or in
animal intermediate
or definitive hosts.
Completely generic term that does not
assume the species and/or stage of
Echinococcus spp.
The term “hydatid” is more common,
but also more confusing, and should be
restricted to E. granulosus s. l. Usage of
“echinococcal” with the generic
definition was approved by the majority
of voters (median: 8).
Based on the recommendations of the
World Federation of Parasitologists
regarding the names of parasitic
diseases [32].
https://www.waavp.org/documents/
snopad-guidelines/#.XS9gBvIza00
Egg, Noun Product of the hermaphrodite
fecundation in the last proglottis
of the adult form of Echinococcus
spp. parasites; released in the feces
of the definitive hosts and the
environment.
Should be restricted to the
stages preceding ingestion by
the intermediate host and oncosphere
release [27].
See Figures 2A–2C for detailed
description and terminology.
Fertile
(strobilar
stage/adult form,
or worm),
Adjective
Adult form/strobilar stage (worm)
of Echinococcus spp. in the
definitive host, the last segment
of which contains eggs
(i.e. infectious to intermediate
hosts).
Production of eggs, observable in the
last segment of the adult form implies
that the worm is fertile (conversely,
absence of eggs does not automatically
imply that it is non-fertile; it may just
be “immature”)
Please see also the definition of “fertile”
for the parasitic structures in the
intermediate host, and the definition of
“immature”, in this table.

*Fertile
(metacestode,
larva, cyst,
microcyst...),
Adjective
Larval parasitic structure that
contains viable protoscoleces
and thus allows infection of the
definitive hosts through scoleces
or in some pathological or
experimental circumstances
production of newly developed
metacestodes in the intermediate
host.
Production of protoscoleces by the
germinal layer and their release in
the parasitic fluid (whatever the
species) implies that the metacestode
is fertile.
This adjective with its definition for
the metacestode in intermediate
hosts was approved unanimously by
the voters (median: 10).
Germinal layer,
Expression
Inner cellular part of
Echinococcus
spp. metacestode, which includes
several types of cells and
produces several types of
biological components of the
metacestode (cyst fluid, brood
capsules, and protoscoleces).
The term “layer” should be preferred
to “germinal membrane” because of
the complexity of the various
“layers” of the cyst, and the possible
confusion of “membrane” with the
cell “membrane”, which has a
specific definition in biology.
The correct description of the
parasitic structures in the
intermediate host includes three
similar expressions, from inside to
outside:
– Germinal layer
– Laminated layer
– Adventitial layer
See also Figures 2A–2C.
*Germinative cell,
Expression
Pluripotent somatic stem cell
with
some homologies but also
differences to neoblasts of free￾living flatworms. Germinative
cells are the only mitotically
active cells in the metacestode
and give rise to all differentiated
cells.
Most commonly used expression in
the literature, with this definition
[47].
However, it must be noted that not
all cells of the germinal layer are
germinative cells.
The expression was approved by the
majority of voters (median: 8)
against the alternative “germinal”
(median: 3).
Hooks, Noun Appendices of the adult form of
Echinococcus spp. parasites that
allow them to attach to the
intestinal wall of the definitive
hosts.
This term should be used because all
hooks on the scolex of Echinococcus
spp. have the same size.
*Hydatid,
Adjective
Refers to Echinococcus spp.
metacestode in intermediate
hosts;
more specifically refers to the
metacestode of Echinococcus
granulosus s.l.
From the ancient Greek ύδατíς –
hydatis-, genitive – ύδατíδoς -
hydatidos (vesicle/bladder full of
water), “hydatid”, which describes
the larval stage of Echinococcus spp.
(metacestode) should never be used
for the adult stage of Echinococcus
spp.
The restriction of the definition of
the adjective “hydatid” to the
metacestode of E. granulosus s.l.
was approved unanimously by the
voters (median: 10).
In order to avoid confusion between
human diseases caused by the
various species, “hydatid” should
not be used
to designate anything relating to
alveolar echinococcosis (or
E. multilocularis) or neotropical
echinococcoses (or E. vogeli or
E. oligarthra).
Hydatid, Noun Parasitological description of the
cyst-like asexual larval form of
cestodes; more specifically,
description of the last stage of the
metacestode of
E. granulosus s.l.
From the ancient ύδατíς –hydatis-,
genitive – ύδατíδoς -hydatidos
(vesicle/bladder full of water).
Usable with this definition only
for purely parasitological
descriptions.
Should be restricted (by usage, not
strictly by definition) to the
metacestode of
E. granulosus s.l. It should not be
used for the metacestode of
E. multilocularis.

*Hydatid fluid,
Expression
Liquid secreted by the
germinal layer of
Echinococcus spp.
metacestode.
Following the suggestion of using
“hydatid” only to qualify nouns or
expressions related to E. granulosus
s.l. (see above), this expression
should also be restricted to these
species. For any other species “fluid”
should be preceded by the
taxonomic name of the species, or
the expression “cyst fluid” (for in
vivo situations) or “vesicle fluid” (for
in vitro situations) could be used.
All voters but one (median: 10)
approved the use of “hydatid
fluid” for E. granulosus s.l. only.
**Immature
(strobilar
stage/adult
form),
Adjective
Strobilar stage/adult form of
Echinococcus spp. in the
definitive host the last
segment of which does not
contain eggs (i.e. at least
temporarily non-infectious to
intermediate hosts).
“Immature” just indicates that the
adult form has not fully developed
to the stage of egg production; it
does not imply that the adult worm
will never become fertile, as could
suggest the alternative “non-fertile”.
See also the entry “non-fertile” in
Table 2B regarding the strobilar
stage/adult form; and also “non￾fertile”, approved for the
metacestode in the intermediate
host, in this table.
This adjective was added by the
SWG, on experts’ suggestion, to
the list of approved terms after
the poll.
*Infiltrate
(periparasitic),
Noun
Histological components
(cellular and fibrous) of host
origin in alveolar
echinococcosis; opposite to
the “adventitial layer” of CE
cysts, the cellular and fibrous
infiltrate in AE has no clear
limits with the surrounding
liver parenchyma.
Alternative term to “infiltration”. The use of “infiltrate” was
approved by all voters but one
(median: 10).
Laminated
layer,
Expression
Peripheral acellular outer part
of Echinococcus spp.
metacestode, mostly
composed of
mucopolysaccharides.
The laminated layer is produced by
the parasite and exerts important
functions in the interaction between
the metacestode and the
intermediate host [21].
The term “layer” should be preferred
because of the complexity of the
various “layers” of the metacestode,
and the possible confusion of
“membrane” with the cell
“membrane”, which has a specific
definition in biology.
The correct description of the
parasitic structures in the
intermediate host includes 3
similar expressions, from inside
to outside:
 Germinal layer
 Laminated layer
 Adventitial layer
See also Figures 2A–2C.
*Larva,
Noun
Asexual reproduction stage of
Echinococcus spp. parasites
in their intermediate host.
Generally used as a popular
equivalent of “metacestode”.
All voters but 2 considered that
“larva” and “metacestode” were
synonymous; however,
metacestode should be preferred
for scientific communication; see
also the entry “larval form”.
Larval form,
Expression
Asexual reproduction form of
Echinococcus spp. parasites
in their intermediate hosts.
Expression coherent with the
recommended expression
“adult form”.
The expression may be used as
an equivalent of metacestode (or
of larva)
for communication to the public
and to professionals.

**Metacestode
(singular)
metacestodes
(plural),
Noun
Asexual reproduction
form of Echinococcus
spp. parasites in their
intermediate hosts;
second phase of
development which
includes all stages from
the post-oncospheral
stage to the fertile stage
(with production of
protoscoleces, if any).
Scientific designation of cestode
parasites in their intermediate
hosts; larva is an alternative noun
usable for communication to the
public and to professionals.
As the voters did not agree
on the definition of
“metacestode” (i.e. stages
of development included
in the definition), this was
further discussed by
experts after the poll, and
the final definition (shown
in the second column) was
approved.
The approved definition is
supported by textbooks of
veterinary parasitology [28] and
those on Echinococcus spp. [72].
*Microcysts
(echinococcal,
E. multilocularis,
AE), Noun,
microcystic,
Adjective
Multiple small cysts
(under 1 cm of diameter)
with germinal layer,
laminated layer and
periparasitic infiltrate of
host’s cells and fibrosis,
characteristic of AE
lesions (due to
E. multilocularis).
Should be reserved for AE lesions
in vivo; may be observed with
selected imaging techniques such
as Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(T2-weighted images) in humans
or preclinical models, and/or
histological examination in
experimental models.
In this situation, “micro”
does not refer to
“microscopic” but to
“small” (from ancient
Greek lijqó1 –micros
(small)) macroscopic
aggregated cysts in AE,
opposite to the “big” –
often isolated – cysts in
CE or E. oligarthra-NE or
multicystic presentation of
E. vogeli-NE. This noun
with this definition was
approved by 8/10 voters
(median: 9).
Microcysts are parasitic structures,
distinct from the central necrotic
cavity often developed in the AE
lesions (“pseudocyst” should be
used for this cavity). See also the
entry “pseudocyst” in this table.
The noun “microcysts”[6] may
replace the expression “multiple
small round cysts” found in
Kodama et al., 2003[43].
*Non-fertile
(metacestode,
larva, cyst,
microcyst...),
Adjective
Parasitic structure in the
intermediate host that
does not contain viable
protoscoleces, and thus
is unable to infect
definitive hosts.
A “non-fertile” metacestode
may be “viable”; these adjectives
are not synonymous [22].
This definition of “non￾fertile” for the
metacestode in
intermediate hosts was
approved by all voters but
one (median: 10)
*Non-viable
(metacestode,
larva, cyst,
microcyst,
protoscolex...),
Adjective
Parasitic structure in the
intermediate host that
does not contain living
cells able to proliferate
in appropriate
conditions, i.e. which
does not grow when
transplanted into
a new intermediate host,
or put into culture in
vitro.
“Non-viable” implies that the
parasitic structure does not
grow when transplanted into
the same or a new intermediate
host, or put into culture in an
appropriate medium in vitro.
However, non-invasive evaluation
of non-viability in vivo is still
imperfect [22].
This definition of “viable”
for the metacestode in
intermediate hosts was
approved by all voters
(median: 10).
Oncosphere,
Noun
Infectious form of
Echinococcus spp.
parasites resulting from
the release from the egg
through the action of
proteolytic enzymes in
the digestive system of
intermediate hosts.
Should be restricted to the stage
following ingestion by the
intermediate host, just before the
cell proliferation stage (post￾oncospheral stage) that will
constitute the metacestode.
See Figures 2A and 2B for
detailed description and
terminology [27].

Pericyst, Noun;
pericystic, Adjective
Tissue surrounding the cyst.
Regarding echinococcosis, the
adjective applies to
E. granulosus sensu lato only:
tissue/structure (e.g. liver, lung,
adrenal gland, brain, etc.) that
surrounds the CE cyst which
includes:
– the cyst fluid,
– the germinal layer,
– the laminated layer,
– the adventitial layer.
As the cyst, in E. granulosus sensu
lato infection, includes
the adventitial layer, the
pericyst only corresponds to
the organ parenchyma (plus vessels
and ducts) which surrounds the cyst.
In the clinical (or animal/
experimental) situation in CE, the
noun “pericyst” (or the adjective
“pericystic”) should not be used to
designate the adventitial layer
(which is “periparasitic”, not
Should not be used in “pericystic”).
E. multilocularis infection to qualify
the tissue/structure that surrounds
the lesions.
Periparasitic,
Adjective
Tissue surrounding the
parasite. For E. granulosus s.l.:
tissue/structures that surround
the laminated layer of the hydatid.
In the cyst developed in
E. granulosus s.l. infection
in the intermediate host, the
adventitial layer, produced
by the host, surrounded by the
normal parenchyma (plus
vessels and ducts)
represents the
“periparasitic” tissue.
In the clinical (or animal/
experimental) situation in CE,
“periparasitic” (which includes the
adventitial layer and the normal
parenchyma of the organ) should not
be a synonym for “pericystic”
(which only includes the normal
parenchyma of the organ; see also
the definition of “(hydatid) cyst” and
In the lesion developed in Figs. 2A–2C).
E. multilocularis infection, the
inflammatory tissue (granuloma) that
surrounds the lesion without clear
limit with the organ parenchyma
represents the “periparasitic
infiltrate”.
For E. multilocularis: tissue/
structures that surround the
laminated layer of
E. multilocularis microcysts.
*Post-oncospheral
stage, Expression
Stage between the oncosphere and
the fully constituted metacestode.
As it textually refers to the
“oncosphere”, this expression more
precisely addresses Echinococcus
spp. than “transitional larva” which
may apply to any type of larvae.
From a developmental biology/
immunology point of view, the early
stages of development in the
intermediate host are crucial as this
is the time when the parasite is most
susceptible to killing [21, 76];
agreement on this point was
unanimous (median: 10).
*Proglottis
(singular),
proglottides (plural),
Noun
Part of the adult form of
Echinococcus spp. parasites
resulting from the segmentation of
the scolex in the intestine of
definitive hosts.
Referring to the Greek origin
of the word (ckx~ssí1: strap),
“proglottis (sing), proglottides
(plur) should be preferred to
“proglottid”; in British English,
the original plural of words from
other languages is kept, hence
“proglottides”.
Both spellings “proglottis” and
“proglottid” were in use. However,
the majority of voters (median: 9)
selected the original (Greek)
spelling.
Protoscolex
(plural:
protoscoleces),
Noun
Prefiguration of the scolex, produced
by the brood capsules budding to the
outside of the germinal layer of
Echinococcus spp. metacestode and
released
in the cyst (CE) or micro-cyst (AE)
fluid.
From the ancient Greek “rjὠken”-
scolex (worm), genitive: rjὠkejo1
-scolecos, and not -scolicos; the
plural form is rjὠkeje1, scoleces,
and not scolices; with the prefix
“pqxs ~ o1”-protos (first/before).
For illustration of the formation of
the protoscoleces, see Figure 1 in
Koziol et al., 2016 [46].
Scolex (plural:
scoleces), Noun
First segment (“head”) of the adult
form of cestodes.
From the ancient Greek “rjὠken”-
scolex (worm), genitive: rjὠkejo1
-scolecos, and not -scolicos; the
plural form is rjὠkeje1, scoleces,
and not scolices.
The plural form of scolex (and of all
derived words) should definitely be
“scoleces”.

Segment, Noun Part of the adult form of
Echinococcus spp. parasites
resulting from segmentation of
the scolex in the intestine of

English equivalent of “proglottis”. May be used as a popular
equivalent of “proglottis” in
reviews for students and
professionals, or
communication to the public,
etc.
**Strobilar stage,
Expression
Sexual reproduction stage (also
called “adult form”) of
Echinococcus spp. parasites in
their definitive hosts.
Specific scientific expression to
designate this step in the
development of Echinococcus spp.
cestodes.
Like its more popular
synonym “adult form”, it
includes all stages of
development in the definitive
host (fertile or immature
worms i.e. with the last
segment containing eggs or
not).
Suckers,
Noun
Appendices of the adult form of
Echinococcus spp. parasites
which allow them to attach to the
intestinal wall of the definitive
hosts and to feed from it.
No synonyms. See also Figures 2A–2C.
*Vesicle fluid,
Expression
Liquid produced in vitro by the
metacestode of Echinococcus
spp., regardless of the species.
Should be reserved for the in vitro
situation where the fluid is devoid
of host components, and when the
Echinococcus spp.-derived nature
is clear from the context.
The distinction between
“vesicle fluid”
(in vitro situation) and cyst
fluid (in vivo situation) and
usage of the noun “vesicle”
for in vitro cultures only were
approved by all voters but one
(median: 10).
*Vesicle
(parasitic or
echinococcal),
Noun
Anatomical entity produced by
the growth in vitro of the
metacestode of Echinococcus
spp. regardless of the species.
Should be reserved for the in vitro
situation where the vesicles are
devoid of host components.
The distinction between
“vesicle” (in vitro) and cyst
(in vivo) and usage of the
noun “vesicle” for in vitro
cultures only, were approved
by all voters but one
(median: 10).
*Viable
(metacestode,
germinal layer,
larva, cyst,
microcyst,
protoscoleces...),
Adjective
Parasitic structure of the
metacestode which contains
living cells able to proliferate in
appropriate conditions.
“Viable” implies that the structure
(of any type) may grow in the
same or a new intermediate host or
in appropriate in vitro culture
medium; viable parasitic structures
may or may not contain
protoscoleces (parasite stage
necessary for the infection of
definitive hosts). However, non￾invasive evaluation of viability in
vivo is still imperfect [22].
This definition of “viable” for
the metacestode in
intermediate hosts was
approved by all voters
(median: 10).
*Worm, Noun Strobilar stage of Echinococcus
spp. parasite in its definitive
hosts (popular term).
Used as an even more popular
equivalent of “strobilar stage” than
“adult form”.
May be a source of confusion
with non-parasitic worms.
However, it is tolerated
because it is useful for
teaching, reviews for students
and professionals, and
communication to the public.

Alveolar
echinococcosis,
Expression
(abbreviation: AE)
Disease due to
E. multilocularis, with
multiple microcysts giving
an “alveolar” aspect on
sectioning of the infected
organ.
Widely used since the recognition of the
disease in the 19th century [18, 78]. From
the name of the species “Echinococcus”
and the Latin adjective “alveolar”,
genitive –alveolaris” (composed of or
relating to “alveoli”/small holes/air sacs
in the lung). The expression conforms to
the recommendation of the WFP; the
preceding adjective provides precision on
the morphology of the lesion (alveolar).
The adjective “alveolar” clearly indicates
the morphological aspect of the lesions
(especially in the liver).
Absence of precision regarding the type
of disease leads to misunderstanding
between experts, stakeholders and policy
makers.
Recommended by the WHO-IWGE
since its first “Guidelines” [83]
Differentiates the disease due to
E. multilocularis from that due to
E. granulosus sensu lato easily.
*Anti-parasitic
treatment,
Expression
Pharmacological or
biological treatment of
echinococcosis, able to
kill Echinococcus spp. or
stop or delay their
development at the various
stages of the parasitic
cycle.
May apply to the various stages of
Echinococcus spp.-related infections, in
the intermediate host (including humans)
and in the definitive host (pets, domestic
or wild animals). Type of drugs or
treatment schedules may be different for
the various stages and the various
diseases [10, 35, 74, 75].
This expression was unanimously
accepted by voters (median: 10) to
replace definitively the noun
“chemotherapy”, excluding all other
options. See also Table 2C.
*CE cyst,
Expression
Anatomical lesion due to
infection with
Echinococcus granulosus
sensu lato, excluding all
other species of
Echinococcus.
Alternative name to designate a
cyst/cysts due to infection with
E. granulosus sensu lato. From the
abbreviation of “cystic echinococcosis”
(CE) and the ancient Greek noun jύrsi1,
-cystis- (anatomical bladder). The
expression should be used for clinical
cases (cysts observed in cystic
echinococcosis in humans or intermediate
animal hosts) or in vivo experiments in
animals [35, 81]. In agreement with the
international WHO-IWGE classification
of cysts due to E. granulosus sensu lato
infection, from ultrasound examination
(CE1 to CE5) [82].
A majority of voters (and a few RRG
members) preferred to use “CE cyst”
only and reject the use of hydatid cyst
(median 8); however, there was no
unanimity (3 voters rating under 6).
Because the “Biology and Immunology
subgroup supported the use of “hydatid”
restricted to E. granulosus s.l., at least
temporarily, because of the widely used
expressions “hydatid cyst” and “hydatid
fluid”, both expressions will be
tolerated. Using “CE cyst” is highly
recommended.
*Complicated
(echinococcosis,
CE, AE, cyst...),
Adjective
In CE, AE or NE:
spontaneous or provoked
events (including after
therapeutic interventions)
that occur in the CE/NE
cyst/AE lesion.
Clinical definition. Complications
may be:
– Rupture (outside or in structures of the
infected organ),
– Compression or invasion of internal
structures of the infected organ or of
neighboring organs,
– Superinfection of the CE/NT cyst or of
the AE pseudo-cyst with bacteria or
fungi,
– Anaphylactic (IgE-dependent allergic)
reactions due to echinococcal antigens,
– Compression or invasion of internal
structures/tissues (e.g. for bone or brain)
in CE/NE and AE [35].
The adjective “complicated”, for
echinococcosis, should not be used to
designate the simple growth of the
parasite (with or without pain) if there
are no consequences on the structures of
the infected organ or on the neighboring
organs. The large size of the cyst and its
proximity to bile ducts or vessels in the
liver (or bronchi or vessels in the lung,
or vital structures in the brain) are not
“per se” complications; even though
they make the surgical treatment more
difficult or impossible, they are just
anatomical particularities.
The term, with this definition, was
accepted unanimously by the voters
(median: 10).

Cystectomy,
Noun
Removal of a cyst,
whatever its nature;
more specifically,
removal of a CE cyst
(anatomical lesion
due to the infection
by E. granulosus s.l.
or E. oligarthra).
From the ancient Greek jύrsi1, -cystis-
(anatomical bladder), and ἐjsolή, -ectomè/
ectomia- (to cut out; to cut and remove), the
suffix “-ectomy”, in surgical vocabulary,
refers to any type of removal of an organ or a
lesion. So, literally it means “removal of the
cyst”. The context must be clear so that there
may be no confusion between a CE cyst and
any other types of cysts. In addition, the
cystectomy should be qualified by the type of
surgical technique, the type of cyst opening,
and the extent of cyst removal.
Should never be used alone, without
qualification, in a scientific/medical publication.
The recommended order for qualification follows
the AORC framework:
– Type of Approach (A): laparotomy,
laparoscopy or robotic,
– Type of cyst Opening (O): opened-cyst (OC) or
non-opened cyst (NOC),
– Type of Resection (R): cystectomy,
hepatectomy (segmentectomy, lobectomy or
pneumonectomy, for the lung).
– Completeness of cyst removal (C): total, subtotal
or partial. See also Figure 3 for the description of
the AORC framework with the definition of its
various components in liver CE surgery.
Cystic
echinococcosis,
Expression
(abbreviation: CE)
Disease due to
E. granulosus
sensu lato.
The expression conforms to the
recommendation of the WFP; the preceding
adjective, from the Middle French
“cystique”, from the ancient Greek
jύrsi1, -cystis- (anatomical bladder),
provides precision on the morphology
of lesion (cystic).
Absence of precision regarding the type of
disease leads to misunderstanding between
experts, stakeholders and policy makers.
Recommended by the WHO-Informal Working
Group on Echinococcosis (WHO-IWGE) since
its first “Guidelines”[83]. Differentiates the
disease due to E. granulosus sensu lato, from
those due to E. multilocularis, E. oligarthra and
E. vogeli, respectively.
*/**Cystoid,
Adjective
(Adjective
common to
“Biology￾Immunology”
and to “Clinical
Aspects”)
Hypodense, cyst-like
image observed at
CT in AE lesions.
From the ancient Greek eἶdo1 –eïdos-
(shape), the suffix “-id” (with the infix “-o-”
whenever useful in a given language) refers
to anything “which has the shape of ...
something”; thus “cystoid”: which has the
shape of a cyst (without being a real cyst).
This adjective was proposed and published for
the classification of AE lesions at computed
tomography (CT) scanning in 2016 [23] and used
thereafter in other publications. Although the
adjective “pseudocystic” was preferred by the
majority of voters (median: 9 for the “Biology￾Immunology group and 7 for the “Clinical
Aspects group), the adjective “cystoid” was
maintained after the poll to describe cyst-like
images observed using computed tomography
scanning and which cannot be attributed
unequivocally to the necrotic cavity present in
advanced lesions of AE.
In AE, the cystoid structures observed on
imaging may be due to the central, liquefied
necrosis in advanced AE lesions or to other
cyst-like components such as conglomerate
of microcysts or in very small lesions,
occasionally, a hypodense solid necrosis.
As these structures do not correspond to a
parasitological entity, a specific word should
differentiate these pathological cyst-like
macroscopic structures from the real parasitic
“cysts” of CE.
*Daughter cyst,
Expression
Newly formed
hydatids inside (and
far less frequently
outside, if any) the
CE cyst in the
development of
Echinococcus
granulosus s.l. Not
applicable to
E. multilocularis/AE.
This expression has been in use for a century,
translated from the French “vésicule fille”
(daughter vesicle), proposed by Dévé (the
word “vésicule” being feminine in French,
hence “daughter”). It is the established-by￾use name of such anatomical structures
which are derived from the germinal layer, in
case of aggression of the metacestode (see
Figs. 2A–2C) [18, 64, 68].
All suggested names for this metacestode
structure were rejected by the majority of voters
(median for “daughter cyst”, daughter hydatid,
and daughter vesicle: 2, 1 and 3, respectively;
means 4.63, 1.72 and 4.70, respectively).
The word “daughter” evokes sexual reproduction
(which does not exist for the metacestode), and
“cyst” a complete CE cyst structure, with a fully
developed adventitial layer (which is generally
hardly present in this structure). However, the
adjective “secondary” was considered by the
participants in the CRG to be irrelevant for this
situation (used for the growth of new cysts after
protoscolex spillage), and the noun “vesicle” was
accepted by biologists with restricted use for in
vitro culture of the metacestode; hence the
decision of the SWG to keep the “historical”,
albeit inexact, wording.

neo-tropical
echinococcosis
disseminated to
more than one
organ/tissue.
The definition implies that the cysts/lesions

Echinococcosis
(plural:
Echinococcoses),
Noun
Disease(s) related to
infection with
parasites of the
Echinococcus (E.)
genus.
Recommended by the World Federation of
Parasitologists (WFP) (i.e. name of the genus
followed by the suffix -osis) The English
name of the World Association of
Echinococcosis (WAE; previously
“International Association of Hydatidology)
was modified in 2015 at the 26th World
Congress of Echinococcosis in Bucharest,
Romania, to follow this rule.
Without precision regarding the type of disease,
this noun can only be used when all diseases due
to Echinococcus spp. are considered together, and
preferably used as a plural (echinococcoses); it
should be avoided in epidemiological, clinical,
and mechanistic studies covering all 3 diseases.
Besides this “generic” usage, distinction should
always be made between cystic echinococcosis
(CE), due to E. granulosus sensu lato (s.l.),
alveolar echinococcosis (AE), due to
E. multilocularis, and neotropical echinococcosis
(NE), due to E. vogeli or E. oligarthra.
ERCP, Acronym

Retrograde
Cholangio￾Pancreatography,
Expression
Per-endoscopic
technique used to
explore the biliary
and pancreatic ducts,
regardless of the
disease; it may or
may not be
associated with
sphincterotomy or
other additional
procedures.
In CE and AE diagnostic procedures, no
exploration of the pancreatic ducts is
performed, but the acronym ERCP is
commonly used even though the pancreatic
exploration is not performed.
Performance of the ERCP may be only for
diagnostic purposes; however, usually it has a
therapeutic intent and is the first step of
perendoscopic biliary drainage. In scientific
publications, this distinction should be clearly
stated.

(ELRA),
Expression
Surgical operation
which includes:
– Total hepatectomy
followed by
– Ex-vivo resection of
the pathological
parts of the liver
associated with
– Various types of
reconstruction of
the bile ducts and/or
vessels then by
– Re-implantation
(“auto￾transplantation”) of
the liver
orthotopically.
Surgical technique used for the treatment of
advanced AE. The expression includes all
steps of the procedure; so it should be
preferred to partial expressions such as
“ex-vivo liver resection” or “auto￾transplantation”. The abbreviation was
proposed by the surgical team that has
performed most of these procedures and
includes all main terms of the expression [2].
The numerous alternative expressions and
acronyms should no longer be used.
Hepatectomy Removal of the liver
or part of it.
From the ancient Greek ή
~
πaq, -hepar;
genitive ή
~
paso1 –hepatos (liver), and the
suffix ἐjsolή, -ectomè/ectomia- (to cut out;
to cut and remove); in the surgical
vocabulary it refers to any type of removal of
an organ or a lesion. So, literally it means
“removal of the liver” (which is literally
correct only in liver transplantation). Various
types are described, valid for all types of
diseases subject to liver surgery.
Should always be qualified, according to the
usual definitions of hepatic surgery, and of the
liver segments; definitions are valid for the
application to all types of diseases, including
echinococcosis [29].

*Hydatid cyst,
Expression (word
common to
“Biology –
Immunology” and
to “Clinical
aspects”)
Anatomical lesion due
to infection with
Echinococcus granulosus
sensu lato, excluding all
other species of
Echinococcus.
From the ancient Greek ύdasí1 –hydatis-,
genitive – ύdasído1 -hydatidos (vesicle/bladder
full of water). According to the definition of
“hydatid” (as an adjective), the expression
should be restricted to designate a cyst /cysts
due to infection with E. granulosus s.l. in the
intermediate host (including humans).
As it adds to confusion in epidemiological
and clinical studies, it should never be used
to designate the anatomical lesion due to
E. multilocularis infection. The definition
was approved by the unanimity of voters
(median: 10).
A majority of voters preferred to totally
reject the use of “hydatid cyst” (median 8
for the specific question; see above “CE
cyst”). As there was no unanimity and as
the “Biology and Immunology” subgroup
supported the use of “hydatid” restricted to
E. granulosus s.l., at least temporarily,
because of the widely used expression
“hydatid cyst”, both expressions will be
tolerated. Nevertheless, the use of “CE
cyst” is highly recommended.
As it designates an anatomical lesion and
not a disease, it should never be used as an
alternative name for Echinococcus
spp.-related infection (“echinococcosis”).
To designate the diseases due to Echinococcus
spp. the noun “echinococcosis” qualified by
the type of disease (cystic, alveolar or
neotropical) should be used (abbreviations
CE, AE, NE; see above).
**Laparoscopy,
Noun
Surgical approach
performed for operations
in the abdomen or pelvis
using small incisions
(usually 0.5–1.5 cm) with
the aid of a camera.
Qualifies any surgical intervention performed
under laparoscopy. To be preferred to
“coelioscopy”, more used in gynecology.
Should be added to the noun or expression
describing any type of intervention, if this
surgical intervention is performed by
laparoscopy. See also Figure 3 and the
description of the AORC framework with
the definition of its various components in
liver CE surgery.
**Laparotomy,
Noun
Surgical approach which
includes a large opening
of the abdomen.
Qualifies any surgical intervention performed
under laparotomy.
Should be added to the noun or expression
describing any type of intervention, if this
surgical intervention is performed by
laparotomy. See also Figure 3 and the
description of the AORC framework with
the definition of its various components in
liver CE surgery.
Modified
catheterization
technique,
Expression
Mo-CAT,
Acronym
Percutaneous procedure
for treatment of CE cysts
that results in removal of
the cyst layers, possibly
including daughter
cysts, in addition to the
cyst fluid and
protoscoleces.
Similar techniques (such as PEVAC) previously
described are no longer in use [36, 71, 81].
The name of the procedure and the acronym
“Mo-CAT” clearly distinguish this procedure
from the conventional PAIR and from the
“standard catheterization technique” [3, 61]
The mode of percutaneous puncture
guidance (e.g. ultrasound-guided, CT￾guided) should also be given, as well as the
type/size of catheterization and aspiration.
The expression and its acronym were
accepted by the majority of voters
(median: 10).
*Multicystic
(echinococcosis;
images), Adjective
Any type of
echinococcosis with
multiple aggregated cysts
observed on imaging or
during surgery in the
same organ.
Avoids the confusing use of “polycystic”,
which currently refers both to cystic or alveolar
echinococcosis with multiple large size-cysts
observed on imaging, and to E. vogeli
infection; also avoids confusion with
polycystic liver (and kidney) disease.
The adjective “multicystic” should not be
used to qualify the usual “alveolar” aspect
of the aggregated “microcysts” in AE. It
should not be used to qualify cases of CE
or NE with multiple separated and
independent cysts observed on imaging or
during surgery in the same organ or
different organs; see the definition of
“multiple cyst-”. This term was accepted by
the majority of voters (median: 10). See
also “polycystic”, the rejected term, in
Table 2C.
**Multiple cyst-,
Expression used as
Adjective
Any type of
echinococcosis (except
AE) with multiple
separated and independent
cysts observed on imaging
or during surgery in the
same organ or different
organs.
Clearly distinguishes the “multicystic”
aspect of lesions and the presence
of multiple cysts.
Should not be used to qualify cases of AE
with multiple lesions. Should not be used to
qualify cases with aggregated cysts in the
same organ (i.e. “multicystic” CE or NE);
see the definition of “multicystic”.

Neotropical
echinococcoses,
Expression
(abbreviation: NE)
Diseases due to
E. vogeli or E. oligarthra.
Conforms to the recommendation by the
WFP (echinococcosis); the preceding
adjective provides precision on the
particularity of the diseases (neotropical)
[36]. “Neotropical” evokes the unique
geographic distribution of the Echinococcus
spp. involved (in the tropical areas of the
New World).
Although the expression does not give any
information on the morphology of the lesion
(“polycystic” in E. vogeli infection;
“unicystic” in E. oligarthra infection), it has
been in use for a while in the literature and
was approved by the South American
Working Group on E. vogeli and
E. oligarthra; it usefully distinguishes the
diseases caused by these species from CE and
AE (see definitions above).
**New CE cyst(s),
Expression
Appearance of a new CE
cyst in a location different
from where a CE cyst was
diagnosed before.
The definition covers all new cysts that
have appeared in a patient after a first
diagnosis; the new cyst may have
appeared spontaneously (e.g. during a
“Watch and Wait” period of follow-up)
or after any type of treatment.
This expression was added by the SWG after
the poll, in agreement with the writers of the
WHO-IWGE Technical Manual. It excludes
all cases of cyst recurrence or reactivation, as
well as “secondary echinococcosis” (see the
definitions of “reactivation” “recurrence”, and
secondary echinococcosis” in this Table 1C).
**Non-opened
cyst (total
cystectomy),
Expression
NOC,
Acronym
Surgical operation which
does not include cyst
opening before cyst removal
(cystectomy). Only applies
to CE, and for total
cystectomy; it is not
relevant for AE.
Linguistically more correct than “close(d)
cystectomy” (a cyst can be “non-opened”
during the surgical procedure, a cystectomy
cannot be close or closed) [81]. This
expression clearly describes the situation
of the cyst (non-opened) and the highly
reduced risk of dissemination of
protoscoleces or germinal membrane
fragments related to the surgical
procedure.
Newly introduced expression, resulting from
the discussion between members of the
“Clinical aspects” subgroup of the CRG.
The adjective expression “non-opened cyst”,
its acronym “NOC” and its definition, to
qualify more precisely the total cystectomy,
were accepted by a majority of voters
(median: 10) See also Figure 3 and the
description of the AORC framework with the
definition of its various components in liver
CE surgery.
**Opened cyst
(total, subtotal,
partial
cystectomy),
Expression
OC,
Acronym
Surgical operation which
includes cyst opening
before cyst removal
(cystectomy). Only
applies to CE; may be
at first or second intent;
it is not relevant for AE.
Linguistically more correct than “open
cystectomy” (a cyst can be opened during
the surgical procedure, a cystectomy
cannot) [81].
Newly introduced expression, resulting from
the discussion between members of the
“Clinical aspects” subgroup of the CRG. The
adjective expression “opened cyst”, its
acronym “OC”, and its definition, to qualify
more precisely the total cystectomy, were
accepted by a majority of voters (median: 10)
See also Figure 3 and the description of the
AORC framework with the definition of its
various components in liver CE surgery.
This expression clearly describes the
situation of the cyst (opened) and the
potential risk of dissemination of
protoscoleces or germinal membrane
fragments related to the surgical
procedure.
(Orthotopic) Liver
transplantation,
Expression
OLT,
Acronym
Removal of the recipient’s
liver followed by the
transplantation of the
donor’s liver (or part of
liver) at the same
anatomical location.
Surgical technique used for the treatment
of advanced cases of AE, and more
rarely of CE. Often used for “allo￾transplantation of the liver”; does
not include auto-transplantation.
The adjective “orthotopic” (and its
abbreviation “O”) is facultative, since the
great majority of liver transplantations in
humans are orthotopic.
PAIR, Acronym
for Puncture,
Aspiration,
Injection of
protoscolecide,
Reaspiration,
Expression
Percutaneous treatment of
CE cysts using needle
puncture and use of
protoscolecide agents.
Accepted name and acronym to designate
the procedure, since its description by Ben
Amor et al., 1986 [8] in French (same
acronym), and its first publication in
English by Gargouri et al., in 1990 [20]. It
describes the 4 steps of the procedure which
does not include catheterization of the cyst.
The procedure was evaluated and its indi￾cations clarified by the WHO-IWGE [10].
The name and acronym must be used only for
the initially described procedure, with needle
puncture, manual syringe aspiration, without
catheterization or other associated techniques.

*Partial
(cystectomy),
Adjective
Surgical intervention
that only partially
removes the 3 layers
of the CE cyst.
Opposite to “subtotal” which only leaves
parts of the adventitial layer in place, this
may include a partial removal of any layer
(including parts of the germinal layer and
laminated layer); usually only the adventitial
layer is left.
By definition, in this situation, the CE cyst has to
be opened (first or second intent opening). The
adjective and its definition were accepted by a
majority of voters (median: 8); however, a
complementary discussion was necessary to
precisely agree on the differences between
“subtotal” and “partial”. See also Figure 3 and the
description of the AORC framework with the
definition of its various components in liver CE
surgery.
*/**Percutaneous
pseudocyst
drainage,
Expression
Imaging-guided
percutaneous
transhepatic
interventional
technique used for
the drainage of the
central “pseudocyst”
in advanced lesions
of AE. Applies to
AE only.
For the treatment of AE, this expression is
preferred to “cavity drainage” since it refers
to the typical “pseudocyst” resulting from the
necrosis of AE lesions; “cavity drainage” is
more commonly used for the drainage/
treatment of the postoperative cavities after
surgery for CE (cystectomy). In AE, such
drainage has no temporal relationship with
any other interventional treatment.
The expression was accepted by the majority of
voters (median: 10). No acronym was fixed. In
any description of the procedure, the mode of
percutaneous puncture guidance (e.g. ultrasound￾guided, CT-guided) should also be given, as well
as the type/size of catheterization and aspiration.
**Percutaneous
post-surgery
cavity drainage,
Expression
Imaging-guided
percutaneous
transhepatic
interventional
technique used for
the drainage of post￾operative cavities
after surgery for CE.
Applies to CE only.
A clearly different expression for the
drainage of the cystoid necrotic cavity
in AE versus the treatment of CE with
postoperative residual cavity was
considered useful. The “post-surgery”
temporal performance of such drainage is
clearly indicated in the expression.
This expression was added by the SWG after the
poll, after recommendation by the RRG, in order
to clearly distinguish the respective situations in
AE and CE. In any description of the procedure,
the mode of percutaneous puncture guidance (e.g.
ultrasound-guided, CT-guided) should also be
given, as well as the type/size of catheterization
and aspiration.
Perendoscopic
biliary drainage
Expression
Non-surgical
interventional
technique used for
the drainage of the
biliary tree, through
ERCP.
The procedure, which applies both to
CE and AE, may or may not include
biliary stenting [4, 71].
The procedure does not include a curative action
on the CE cyst or on the AE lesion; it only treats
complications of the diseases and/or of their
surgical treatment. In scientific publications, if
biliary stenting is associated with the procedure,
this should be specifically mentioned, as well as
the type, size, and number of stents.
*Peri-adventitial
(cystectomy),
Adjective
Total cystectomy
performed without
opening the cyst, and
which uses the
dissection space
between the
adventitial layer and
the “normal” liver
parenchyma to
remove the cyst
totally.
The adjective indicates more precisely that
the resection is performed outside the
adventitial layer (i.e. the adventitial layer is
included in the resected cyst) [37, 81].
The use of this adjective for the description of
cystectomy is facultative. The adjective “peri￾adventitial” and its definition, to qualify more
precisely the total cystectomy, were accepted by a
majority of voters (median: 10) See also
Figure 3 and the description of the AORC
framework with the definition of its various
components in liver CE surgery.
Protoscolecide,
Noun
protoscolecidal,
Adjective
Compound (natural
or chemical) which is
able to kill the
protoscoleces.
From the ancient Greek “rjὠken”-scolex
(worm), genitive: rjὠkejo1 -scolecos, and
not -scolicos; plural rjὠkeje1,
scoleces, and not scolices), with the prefix
“pqxs ~ o1”-protos (first/before), and the
Latin suffix – “-cide”, from “caedere”
(to kill).
Should be used instead of “scolicide”,
“scolecide” and “protoscolicide”. See also

*/**Pseudocyst,
Noun, and
pseudocystic,
Adjective (Noun
and Adjective
common to
“Biology￾Immunology” and
to “Clinical
Aspects”)
Irregular cyst-like
anatomical entity due to the
central necrosis in AE
lesions at advanced stages.
From the ancient Greek “wetdή1” –
“pseudès- (= false, deceptive,
misleading) that designates something
which looks like something but is not;
thus “pseudocyst”: anatomical entity
which looks like a cyst but is not a
cyst. The terms differentiate the cyst￾like necrotic cavity in AE from the
real “cyst” of CE (with its parasitic
structure including the 3 layers). This
structure does not correspond to a
parasitological entity. In medicine, the
term “pseudocyst” is generally used
for the necrotic cavities that develop
after episodes of pancreatitis in the
pancreas.
The terms were approved by the
majority of voters (median: 9). The
context and the organ being different
from pancreatitis, and the formation of
the cavity also being due to liquefied
necrosis of an inflammatory lesion, it
was considered that the words
“pseudocyst” and “pseudocystic” could
also be used in AE. However, the
adjective “cystoid” was maintained to
qualify cyst-like structures (irrespective
of their anatomical nature) observed at
imaging (especially at CT-scan) in AE
lesions.
PTBD, Acronym,
for Percutaneous
Transhepatic
Biliary Drainage,
Expression
Non-surgical interventional
technique used for the
drainage of the biliary tree,
which is used in AE or
complicated CE, after
percutaneous puncture.
No synonyms. Expression and
acronym widely used in the medical
literature, whatever the application.
The procedure applies both to CE and
AE and does not include a curative
action on the CE cyst or on the AE
lesion.
The mode of percutaneous puncture
guidance (e.g. ultrasound-guided, CT￾guided) should also be given, as well as
the type/size of catheterization.
**Reactivation,
Noun
Appearance of daughter cyst
(s) in the solid matrix of
spontaneously inactivated
CE4 cysts that shows an
evolution towards a CE3b
stage.
The term “reactivation” is reserved for
spontaneously inactivated cysts
(observed after an initial diagnosis of
CE4 cyst, with or without formal
“Watch and Wait” follow-up).
This term was added by the SWG after
the poll, in agreement with the writers
of the WHO-IWGE Technical Manual,
in order to clearly distinguish the
various situations regarding new lesions
or changes in lesions that appeared
spontaneously or after attempts at
treatment.
**Recurrence,
Noun
Appearance of an active CE
cyst (types CE1-3, usually
CE3b) in the same location
where a treated cyst was
located, independently of
the type of previous
treatment.
Following its definition in oncology,
the term “recurrence” is reserved for
the post-therapeutic situation; the term
“reactivation” applies to non-treated
cysts.
This term was added by the SWG after
the poll, in agreement with the writers
of the WHO-IWGE Technical Manual,
in order to clearly distinguish the
various situations regarding new lesions
or changes in lesions that appeared
spontaneously or after attempts at
treatment.
NB: the occurrence of a post-surgical
cavity needs to be excluded before a
diagnosis of recurrence is made
(cf. the definition of “percutaneous
post-surgical cavity drainage”, in this
Table 1C).
**Secondary cyst,
Expression
Newly formed cysts from
the dissemination of
protoscoleces or germinal
layer fragments, in the
serosal cavities,
spontaneously, accidentally
or after surgery or cyst
puncture.
Mode of formation distinct from that
of daughter cysts; the adjective
“secondary” should, however, be
restricted to the appearance of new CE
cysts in the peritoneum, pleura or
meningeal space because of
spontaneous or per-treatment spillage
of the cyst content.
This expression was added by the SWG
after the poll, to clearly distinguish this
situation from the development of
“daughter cyst”. The expression was
approved by the writers of the WHO￾IWGE Technical Manual, in order to
clearly distinguish the various situations
regarding new CE cysts or changes in
CE cysts that appeared spontaneously or
after attempts at treatment.

catheterization
(technique),
Expression S-CAT,
Acronym
Modification of the
PAIR technique
which includes the
insertion of a catheter
left or not in the cyst
temporarily for the
treatment of selected
CE cysts.
The name of the procedure and the
acronym “S-CAT” clearly
distinguish this procedure from the
conventional PAIR and from the
“modified catheterization technique”
(“Mo-CAT”) [3, 35].
The expression and its
acronym were accepted
unanimously by the voters
(median: 10) It was also
proposed to complete the
description by the following
mentions:
– One-session S-CAT: the
catheter is removed during
the first procedure;
– Multiple-session S-CAT:
the catheter is removed at
another session.
The mode of percutaneous
puncture guidance (e.g.
ultrasound-guided, CT￾guided) should also be given,
as well as the type/size of
catheterization.
*/**Sub-total
(cystectomy),
Adjective
Nearly total
cystectomy with
incomplete removal
of the adventitial
layer of a CE cyst
Situation that occurs when limited
parts of the cyst cannot be removed
safely because of the proximity of
blood vessels or other anatomical
structures (e.g. bile ducts, bronchi,
brain anatomical structures with
critical functions). To be qualified of
“subtotal”, the cystectomy must
remove the totality of the germinal
and laminated layer; only limited
parts of the adventitial layer are left.
By definition, in this situation
(as in “partial cystectomy),
the cyst has to be opened
(second intent opening). The
adjective and its definition
were accepted by a majority
of voters (median: 10);
however, a complementary
discussion after the poll was
necessary to precisely agree
on the differences between
“subtotal” and “partial”.
See also Figure 3 and the
description of the AORC
framework with the definition
of its various components in
liver CE surgery.
*Total
(cystectomy),
Adjective
Complete removal of
a CE cyst, including
the content (fluid and
protoscoleces) and all
layers of the cyst
(germinal, laminated
and adventitial
layers.
The adjective “total” insists on the
complete removal of the CE cyst by
the surgical operation (the “C”, for
“completeness” of the AORC
framework). It does not prejudge of
the opening or not of the cyst at any
time of the procedure. This
operation, when performed on a
non-opened cyst, was sometimes
called “peri-cystectomy”; however, a
proper definition of the CE cyst is
against the use of this word (see
Tables 1B and 2C and Figs. 2A–2C).
The adjective “total”,
speaking of cystectomy, and
its definition were accepted
by all voters but one (median:
10).
See also Figure 3 and the
description of the AORC
framework with the definition
of its various components in
liver CE surgery.

E. multilocularis (Leuckart, 1863)
belongs to the Echinococcus genus
[50, 67]. The International Code for
Zoological Nomenclature should be
followed (see Table 1A) [52].
The genus Alveococcus Abuladze, 1959
(including Alveococcus multilocularis
(Leuckart, 1863)), still used

lato complex that were later
synonymized with the currently
recognized species.
Recently proposed species names should
not be used, unless a case
can be made (e.g. by molecular

Pending precise definition of additional
species within Echinococcus
granulosus sensu lato, besides the
currently accepted “species”
(see Table 1A), “G” genotypes should

Echinococcus
oligarthrus,
Echinococcus
oligarthus,
Expressions
Non-valid names of the species
among Echinococcus spp.
which is responsible for one
of the clinical forms of
“neotropical echinococcoses”
Often referred to as E. oligarthrus
(or even oligarthus), the species
was originally described as Taenia
oligarthra (Diesing, 1863) by
Diesing [14].
In this case, there was no mistake in the
original name of species given by
Diesing; variants were used mistakenly
afterwards in the scientific literature.
However, the genus “Echinococcus”
was subsequently identified and
replaced the genus “Taenia”.
Linguistic and historical arguments
are convincing [52, 58, 81].
See Table 1A.
The component a
;0
qhqa – arthra (joints) – is
the plural of a
;0
qhqom -arthron (joint). The
name is therefore not an adjective, but a
noun in apposition, which does not change
its ending according to the gender of the
generic name. This was recognized earlier
but subsequently ignored.

E. sibiricensis (Rausch & Schiller,
1954), was subsequently found to be
conspecific with E. multilocularis
(Leuckart, 1863) [63].

Comments
*Adult worm,
Expression
Sexual reproduction stage
Echinococcus spp. parasites in their
definitive hosts.
Sometimes used as equivalent of “adult
form”.
The expression was rejected by a
majority of voters (median: 3).
Adult worm may be considered redundant,
since worms are adult forms of helminths.
In addition, “adult form” in the definitive
host corresponds to “larval form” in the
intermediate host.
*Adventitia,
Noun
Fibrous and cellular layer between
the laminated layer of the hydatid in
E. granulosus s.l. infection and the
normal parenchyma of the host
organ where the metacestode
developed.
Word of Latin origin, “adventitia” is the
outermost connective tissue covering of an
organ, vessel, or other biological structure.
In the CE cyst, this poorly cellular and
mostly fibrous layer results from the host
immune reaction to E. granulosus sensu
lato metacestode.
As “adventitia” may be used for any
biological structure, the use of
“adventitial layer”, which refers to the
parasite “germinal layer” and
“laminated layer”, was preferred by the
voters for this structure of host origin
(median: 2, for “adventitia”).
*Boundary
(periparasitic),
Noun
Structures that surround the
laminated layer of the hydatid of
Echinococcus spp. metacestodes in
their intermediate hosts, at the
border with the organ parenchyma.
Alternative noun to “border”; “border” is
more common in pathology terminology.
Rejected because of usage (median: 0).
*Died-out
(cyst, lesion),
Adjective
Non-viable parasitic structure as
evidenced by imaging (complete
calcification in AE, CE5 cyst in CE)
or histological examination (absence
of viable parasitic cells).
Could be used in clinical or experimental
situations when evidence of absence of
viability is not obtained by transplantation
or in vitro culture.
Rejected by a majority of voters
(median: 10, for rejection).
*Germinal cell,
Expression
Pluripotent somatic stem cell with
some homologies but also
differences to neoblasts of free￾living flatworms. Germinative cells
are the only mitotically active cells
in the metacestode and give rise to
all differentiated cells.
Alternative expression to designate
germinative cells. Same adjective as in the
expression “germinal layer” where these
cells are located. However, not all cells in
the germinal layer correspond to this
definition.
The germinal layer also contains other
cell types such as muscle cells, nerve
cells, and calcareous corpuscle￾producing cells. This was an argument
to reject the adjective “germinal” for
such cells (median: 3).
Germinal
membrane,
Expression
Inner cellular layer of the
Echinococcus spp. metacestode.
This term should be avoided and the term
“layer” should be preferred because of the
complexity of the various “layers” of the
hydatid, and the possible confusion of
“membrane” with the cell “membrane”,
which has a specific definition in biology.
Germinal layer is the recommended
expressions to designate the inner
cellular “layer” of parasite origin in the
Echinococcus spp. metacestode.
Hooklets,
Noun
Appendices of the adult worm of
Echinococcus spp. parasites
allowing them to attach to the
intestinal wall of the definitive hosts.
This term, a diminutive of “hooks”, is also
used to designate these structures of the
scolex and adult form of Echinococcus
spp.; it should be avoided because the
term “hooklet” infers a smaller version of
a hook, i.e. that two forms are present, a
larger “hook” and a smaller “hooklet” as
in the haptor of some Monogenean
parasites.
“Hook” is the only term recommended.

Word/
expression
Definition Reasons for rejection, references,
linguistic clarifications
Comments
Hydatic,
Adjective
Related to Echinococcus spp. Gallicism for “hydatid” used as an
adjective.
Should not be used in English.
*Infiltration
(periparasitic),
Noun
Histological components (cellular
and fibrous) from host origin in
alveolar echinococcosis
Alternative noun to “infiltrate”;
infiltrate is more common in pathology
terminology; infiltration has a slightly
different meaning (systemic homing of
inflammatory in the whole organ).
Rejected because of usage (median: 0).
Laminated
membrane,
Expression
Outer acellular layer of the
Echinococcus spp. metacestode.
This term should be avoided and the
term “layer” should be preferred
because of the complexity of the
various “layers” of the hydatid,
and the possible confusion of
“membrane” with the cell
“membrane”, which has a specific
definition in biology.
Laminated layer is the recommended
expression to designate the outer acellular
“layer” of parasite origin in the
Echinococcus spp. metacestode.
Neoblast,
Noun
Somatic stem cell type which
shares homologies with
germinative cells from
Echinococcus spp. metacestodes,
but also display significant
differences.
Specific of planarians (and other
free-living flatworms).
Should not be used for Echinococcus spp.
**Non-fertile
(adult form
or worm),
Expression
Adult form/worm of
Echinococcus spp. whose
last segment does not
contain eggs.
Alternative to “immature” (adult
form or worm). However, non-fertile
could imply that this worm is not
able to become fertile (which is
wrong for the majority of adult
Echinococcus spp. forms, especially
in the definitive host in vivo).
In vitro-reared adult forms of Echinococcus
spp. do not contain eggs; they exhibit some
differences from the in vivo developed adult
forms, and they are presumably non-fertile
[56].
However, the adjective “non-fertile” cannot
be accepted for the usual situation of
in vivo developed Echinococcus spp.
adult forms/worms.
Primary cells,
Expression
All cells that result from lytic
digestion of the Echinococcus spp.
metacestode and can be kept in
culture using the “primary cell
cultivation system”.
“Primary cell” is not a specific
cell type of Echinococcus spp.
metacestode, but a “culture system” [70].
Primary cells are a mixture of “germinative
cells” (~80% at the beginning), muscle cells
and nerve cells [45].
*Proglottid,
Noun
(singular),
Proglottids
(plural),
Noun
Orthographic variant of
“proglottis”: part of the adult
form of Echinococcus spp.
parasites resulting from
segmentation of the scolex in
the intestine of definitive hosts.
Proglottid is an alternative to
proglottis in several dictionaries;
the plural “proglottids” is commonly
used in the USA (American English).
Referring to the Greek origin of the word,
“proglottis (sing), proglottides (plur)
should be preferred.
This spelling was rejected by a majority of
voters (7/10; median: 3)
Protoscolices
(Plural of
protoscolex),
Noun
Prefiguration (“proto”) of the
“scolex”, produced by the brood
capsules budding from the
germinal layer of Echinococcus
spp. metacestode and released
in the cyst fluid.
From the ancient Greek “rjὠken”
-scolex (worm), genitive: rjὠkejo1 -
scolecos, and not -scolicos; the plural
form is rjὠkeje1, scoleces, and not
scolices; with the prefix “pqxs ~ o1”-
protos (first/before).
Protoscoleces is the correct plural form,
according to the etymology of the word.
Scolices
(Plural of
scolex),
Noun
First segment (“head”) of the
adult form of cestodes.
From the ancient Greek “rjὠken”-
scolex (worm), genitive: rjὠkejo1 -
scolecos, and not -scolicos; the plural form
is rjὠkeje1, scoleces, and not scoleces.
Scoleces is the correct plural form,
according to the etymology of the word.
Totipotent
somatic stem
cell,
Expression
Stem cells in the germinal
layer of Echinococcus spp.
metacestode.
Alternative to “germinative cells”;
however, the real totipotent cell,
with specific markers, has not
been identified yet [45].
Pending a better definition of the really
totipotent cells in the germinal layer of
Echinococcus spp. metacestode, a single
expression “germinative cell” should be kept.

*Transitional larva,
Expression
Stage of Echinococcus spp.
between the oncosphere and the
fully developed hydatid (i.e. first
stage in the metacestode
development).
Alternative expression to “post-oncospheral”
stage, but less precise to qualify a stage of a
metacestode since it may apply to any larva. In
addition, “transitional” may qualify any other
stages of development (e.g. when brood
capsules produce protoscoleces).
Rejected by all voters
but 2 (median: 0).
* Agreement to reject the term obtained at the second stage of the consultation (the participants in the Consultation and Rating Group had to
rate their approval or rejection of the words/expressions independently on a scale from 0 to 10; whenever relevant, the median of the votes is
given in the “Comments” column). ** Agreement to reject a term that was not selected at the first stage of consultation; the agreement was obtained at the second stage after further
discussion between experts or after recommendation by the RRG.

*Adventitial (cystectomy),
Adjective
Total cystectomy (usually
performed without opening the
cyst) which uses the dissection
space between the adventitial
layer and the “normal” liver
parenchyma to remove the cyst
more easily.
Proposed alternatives to “peri￾adventitial” to qualify this surgical
technique [35].
The adjectives do not indicate
clearly if the resection is
performed inside or outside the
adventitial layer.
*Sub-adventitial
(cystectomy),
Adjective The adjectives, with their
definition, were rejected by a
majority of voters (median: 0).
Alveococcosis,
Noun
Disease related to infection with
E. multilocularis.
Historical name for the infection due to
E. multilocularis in Russia/Russian
language and Russia-related countries.
Not compliant with the
recommendations of the World
Federation of Parasitologists (WFP),
since it is built from the name of a
wrong genus.
Not in use in other countries/
languages than Russia/Russian
The only recommended name is
“Alveolar echinococcosis (AE)”
(see Table 1C).
*Anti-infectious,
*Anti-infective,
(therapy/treatment/drug),
Drug treatment (usually
chemical) of echinococcosis,
opposed to or associated with
surgery (on the model of
infectious diseases therapy).
Although they are commonly used for
the treatment of infectious diseases,
these adjectives infer prevention as well
as (and even rather than)
treatment.“Anti-parasitic” is more exact,
and more appropriate for parasitic
diseases.
The adjectives “anti-infectious”
and “anti-infective” were rejected
by all voters (median: 10).
Chemotherapy,
Noun
Drug treatment (usually
chemical) of echinococcosis,
opposed to or associated with
surgery (on the model of cancer
therapy)
The word was used at the first trials of
mebendazole/albendazole, for the
treatment of echinococcosis, in the
1980s, to stress the “chemical” nature of
the treatment and oppose this treatment
to surgery which was the only
therapeutic option. Has been used
commonly thereafter.
Even though echinococcosis
shares some particularities with
cancer, the word “chemotherapy”
has gained a strong cancer￾related meaning which may
cause confusion, especially when
echinococcosis occurs in cancer
patients because of the
immunosuppressive effect of the
anti-cancer chemotherapy. In
addition, not all drugs against
echinococcosis are chemical (cf.
immunotherapy and other
biotherapies). It should be
abandoned for the use of “anti￾parasitic” therapy (or treatment,
or drugs). See also Table 1C.

*Closed
cystectomy,
Expression
Surgical operation which does
not include cyst opening before
cyst removal (cystectomy).
Only applies to CE, and for total
cystectomy; it is not relevant for
AE.
Widely used by surgeons; however,
linguistically incorrect: a cystectomy –
which is an intervention – cannot be
“closed”, and a cyst is rather “non￾opened” than “closed” (the surgeon does
not close the cyst, he/she may have it
non-opened) [81].
The majority of voters rejected the
expression (median: 3).The expression
should be replaced by “non-opened cyst
(NOC) -cystectomy”.
See also Table 1C and Figure 3 and the
description of the AORC framework with the
definition of its various components in liver
CE surgery.
*Daughter
hydatid,
Expression
Newly formed hydatids inside
(and far less frequently outside, if
any) the CE cyst in the
development of Echinococcus
granulosus s.l. Not applicable to
E. multilocularis/AE.
Alternative term to “daughter cyst”.
Although it fits well with the description
of the “hydatid”, as a noun, it is not
established by usage.
The term with this definition was rejected by
the majority of voters (median: 1).
*Daughter
vesicle,
Expression
Newly formed hydatids inside
(and far less frequently outside, if
any) the CE cyst in the
development of Echinococcus
granulosus s.l. Not applicable to
E. multilocularis/AE.
Alternative term to “daughter cyst”. As a
literal translation, the use of “vesicle”
would fit with the initial description by
Dévé (“vésicule fille” in French).
The majority of voters rejected all suggested
names for this metacestode structure
(median: 3; mean: 4.7, for “daughter
vesicle”). The arguments which prevailed to
reject “daughter vesicle” and eventually
approve the historical expression “daughter
cyst” was first the worldwide usage and
second the agreement by the participants in
the subgroup “Biology and immunology” to
restrict the use of “vesicle” to the
metacestode of Echinococcus spp. in vitro
only, whatever the species.
Echinococcus
alveolaris,
Expression
Disease related to infection with
E. multilocularis.
Name for the infection due to
E. multilocularis sometimes used
in German-speaking countries.
Mix of the name of the genus and the
adjective qualifying the disease (in Latin...).
Not compliant with the
recommendations of the WFP.
The only recommended name is “Alveolar
echinococcosis (AE)” (see Table 1C).
Echinococcus
cysticus,
Expression
Disease related to infection with
E. granulosus sensu lato (s.l.).
Name for the infection due to
E. granulosus s.l. sometimes used in
German-speaking countries
Mix of the name of the genus and the
adjective qualifying the disease (in Latin...)
Not compliant with the recommendations
of the WFP.
The only recommended name is “Cystic
echinococcosis (CE)” (see Table 1C).
Hydatic,
Adjective
Related to Echinococcus spp. Gallicism for “hydatid”, used as an
adjective (“hydatique”, in French).
Should not be used in English.
Hydatid
disease,
Expression
Disease related to infection with
Echinococcus spp.
Commonly used alternative name to
designate either all diseases due to
Echinococcus spp. or the diseases due to
E. granulosus sensu lato. This disease
name does not fit with the unified
recommendations of the WFP.
This noun should not, in any cases, be used
for alveolar echinococcosis or neotropical
echinococcosis; it should not be used for
E. granulosus s.l. infection in humans either:
the only recommended name is “Cystic
echinococcosis (CE)” (see Table 1C).
In addition, usage of this name increases
confusion among clinicians and decision
makers between the diseases due to
E. granulosus sensu lato and
E. multilocularis, respectively.
Use of “hydatid” as an adjective should be
restricted to infection due to E. granulosus
s.l. (see Tables 1B and 1C) in the
intermediate hosts.
Hydatid
polycystosis,
Expression
Cystic (or other) echinococcoses
with multiple cysts
Sometimes used in publications. Source
of confusion with polycystic (non￾parasitic) diseases (see “polycystic”).
The adjective “multicystic” is now proposed
as a non-specific description of any type of
cystic echinococcosis when several/many
macroscopic cysts are present and visible at
imaging (see Table 1C).
Use of “hydatid” as an adjective should be
restricted to infection due to E. granulosus
s.l. (see Table 1C) in the intermediate hosts.

*Hydatidectomy,
Noun
Partial cystectomy,
including the removal of
the germinal and
laminated layers of
E. granulosus sensu lato
cysts after cyst opening
From the definition of “hydatid”
(see Table 1B), this noun could replace
“partial cystectomy”, with less ambiguity
(especially regarding surgeon’s evaluation
between “subtotal” and “partial”).
Scientifically correct, but not
established by use.
The term with this definition was
rejected by the majority of voters
(median: 0).
Hydatidosis,
Noun
Disease related to
infection with
Echinococcus spp.
Commonly used name to designate the
diseases due to Echinococcus spp. This
disease name does not fit with the
recommendations of the WFP
This noun should not, in any cases, be
used for alveolar echinococcosis or
neotropical echinococcosis; it should
not be used for E. granulosus s.l.
infection in humans either: the only
recommended name is “Cystic
echinococcosis (CE)” (see Table 1C).
In addition, usage of this name increases
confusion among clinicians and decision
makers between the diseases due to
E. granulosus s.l. and
E. multilocularis, respectively.
*Open
cystectomy,
Expression
Surgical operation which
includes cyst opening
before cyst removal
(cystectomy). Only applies
to CE; may be at first or
second intent; it is not
relevant for AE.
Expression widely used by surgeons;
however, linguistically incorrect: a
cystectomy cannot be “open”, but a cyst
may be “opened” (the surgeon does open
the cyst) [81].
The majority of voters rejected the
expression (median: 3). The expression
should be replaced by “non-opened cyst
cystectomy” (NOC).
See also Table 1C and Figure 3 and the
description of the AORC framework
with the definition of its various
components in liver CE surgery.
Pericystectomy Removal of a CE cyst
which includes all layers
of the cyst (including the
adventitial layer).
Wrongly used to designate the operation
which includes the adventitial layer of the
cyst in CE. The prefix “peri” is not useful,
since the adventitial layer is part of the cyst;
“cystectomy” is thus the appropriate word.
Stricto sensu, the “pericyst” is the normal
organ parenchyma that surrounds the cyst
(see Figs. 2A–2C) [68].
See Table 1C for alternative wording
regarding surgery of CE.
The only noun recommended is
“cystectomy”.
See also Figure 3 and the description
of the AORC framework with the
definition of its various components in
liver CE surgery.
Polycystic
echinococcosis,
Expression
Disease related to
infection with E. vogeli
(stressing the multicystic
type/presentation of
E. vogeli infection).
The expression is sometimes wrongly used
in medical publication to designate diseases
due both to E. vogeli, which is most often
polycystic/multicystic and E. oligarthra,
which usually presents with single cysts
similar to those of CE, in humans and in
animal intermediate hosts [11, 35] but may
also be multicystic or even microcystic
(AE-like) [69].
The only recommended name for the
diseases due to E. vogeli and
E. oligarthra is “Neotropical
echinococcosis (NE)” (see Table 1C).
In addition, “polycystic” may cause
confusion between the disease due to
E. vogeli and “polycystic” clinical types of
E. granulosus and E. multilocularis
infections. The adjective “polycystic” is
widely used to designate a genetic non￾parasitic disease of the liver and kidney,
adding to the confusion.
The adjective “multicystic” is now
proposed as a non-specific description
of any type of cystic echinococcosis
when several/many macroscopic cysts
are present and visible at imaging (see
Table 1C).
Polycystic,
Adjective
Constituted of several
cysts (used to qualify the
imaging and operative
aspect of various types of
echinococcosis).
The adjective “polycystic” is not specific to
echinococcosis; “polycystic” is widely used
to qualify a genetic non-parasitic disease of
the liver and kidney; in addition, it has been
used to distinctly qualify the disease due to
E. vogeli (see below).
The adjective “multicystic” is now
proposed as a non-specific description
of any type of cystic echinococcosis
when several/many macroscopic cysts
are present and visible at imaging (see

Additional colleagues, especially from South America and
China, were solicited after the congress. However, only Chinese
colleagues answered positively, which resulted in a relatively
low participation of South American colleagues in the “Clinical
aspects” subgroup, perhaps because of language issues: Spanish
and Portuguese are the publication languages of most South
American clinicians; publications in English from South Amer￾ica are mostly in biology and public health. All members of the
RRG were selected by the SWG on the basis of their interna￾tional academic recognition in the fields of CE, AE and NE.
Despite the absence of face-to-face meetings to discuss the
undecided questions, open email discussions were initiated by
the coordinators of the subgroups, and this procedure was very
efficient. If there were missing values for the poll, the project
manager actively and individually contacted the voters in ques￾tion in order to ask them to provide their opinion. Feedback
from the RRG members was also followed by active discus￾sions in order to reach consensus on important terms and to
revise and finalize this paper.
Major outcomes and conclusions
Currently, a precise genetic definition is available for
nine species: E. granulosus (Batsch, 1786) sensu stricto,
E. canadensis (Webster & Cameron, 1961), E. ortleppi Lopez￾Neyra & Soler Planas, 1943, E. felidis Ortlepp, 1937, and
E. equinus (Williams & Sweatman, 1963), within the
E. granulosus (Batsch, 1786) sensu lato cluster and responsible
for cystic echinococcosis, E. multilocularis (Leuckart, 1863),
and E. shiquicus Xiao, Qiu, Nakao, Li, Yang, Chen, Schantz,
Craig & Ito, 2005, responsible for alveolar echinococcosis, and

Protoscolicide,
Noun;
Protoscolicidal,
Adjective
Compound (natural or
chemical) which is able to
kill the protoscolex.
Synonym for protoscolecide. The
protoscolex is the final stage of the
metacestode of Echinococcus spp, able to
produce a scolex then an adult form of the
parasite in the definitive host, or to
reproduce a metacestode in the
intermediate host. From the ancient Greek
“rjὠken”-scolex (worm), genitive:
rjὠkejo1-scolecos, and not scolicos;
plural rjὠkeje1, scoleces, and not
scolices), with the prefix “pqxs ~ o1”-protos
(first/before), and the Latin suffix –“-cide”,
from “caedere” (to kill).
Should be abandoned for
“protoscolecide” (see Table 1C);
protoscolecides (protoscolecidal agents)
are used to kill the protoscoleces and/or
prevent secondary cysts after surgery.
**Relapse, Noun Any type of
echinococcosis lesions
that appeared after the
implementation of any
type of treatment.
The definition is vague and covers several
types of lesion appearing after attempts of
treatment. More precise definitions of
lesions observed in this situation should be
used.
Should be abandoned for specific terms/
expressions covering the various
situations encountered by clinicians (see
in Table 1C the definitions of “new CE
cyst”, “reactivation”, “recurrence”, and
“secondary echinococcosis”).
Scolecide, Noun;
Scolecidal,
Adjective
Compound (natural or
chemical) that is able to
kill the scolex.
The scolex is the head of the adult form of
Echinococcus spp. From the ancient Greek
“rjὠken”, genitive: rjὠkejo1-scolecos;
plural rjὠkeje1, scoleces). Such
compounds are used to kill protoscoleces,
produced by the metacestode in
intermediate hosts, not scoleces in the
definitive hosts. Usage of “scolecide” is
thus scientifically inexact (killing concerns
the protoscoleces, not the scoleces).
Should be abandoned for
“protoscolecide” (see Table 1C).
Scolicide,
Noun;
Scolicidal,
Adjective
Compound (natural or
chemical) that is able to
kill the scolex.
Synonym for scolecide. The common
usage of “scolicide” is both scientifically
inexact (killing concerns the protoscoleces,
not the scoleces) and etymologically wrong
(see also “scolecide” and “protoscolicide”).
Should be abandoned for
“protoscolecide/protoscolecidal” (see
Table 1C).

1863), responsible for neotropical echinococcosis; the responsi￾bility of some of the species (e.g., E. equinus (Williams and
Sweatman, 1963) or E. shiquicus Xiao et al., 2005) in human
infection is still being questioned; this does not challenge the
genetic definition of these species (Table 1A). Recognition of
additional species within E. canadensis and E. granulosus s.s.
is to be expected (Table 1A). Thus, distinct Echinococcus spp.
genotypes within the E. canadensis cluster may move to full spe￾cies status, and the names E. intermedius (for G6/7), E. borealis
(for G8) and E canadensis (for G10) have been proposed;
however, no conclusion on the number and names of these
species has yet been reached [57].
Variations around the radical “hydatid” have long been
used to designate diseases due to Echinococcus spp. The pre￾sence of “hydatid” cysts had long been recognized as a feature
of a parasitic disease when the natural cycle of the parasite
responsible for its occurrence was identified in the middle of
the 19th century [18, 77]; the species was first named Taenia
echinococcus before becoming Echinococcus granulosus.
In humans, the disease was clearly not a “taeniasis”, and “hyda￾tid disease”, “hydatidosis” (if the disease was considered) or
“hydatid cyst” (if the lesion was considered) thus prevailed. It
took another century before the Echinococcus sp. which causes
AE was identified as a distinct species, E. multilocularis
[18, 77]. It is thus easy to understand why several terms, not
related to the current name of the genus, were used for centu￾ries, and why they were used to designate both diseases, alveo￾lar and cystic echinococcosis. The inappropriate use of
“hydatid” has been a source of confusion, both for disease
surveillance and treatment indication [10, 35]. Until recently,
echinococcosis surveillance by the European Centre for Disease
Control (ECDC) did not distinguish between the two diseases
[23]. A clear distinction between three types of diseases, with
a single name for each of them, will make all studies on epide￾miology, socio-economic burden, and care management more
reliable. There was total agreement to never use terms based
on the “hydatid” root to designate any disease due to
Echinococcus spp., and to strictly restrict the use of “hydatid”
to qualify a lesion or part of a lesion due to E. granulosus
s.l. in intermediate hosts, entirely excluding its use to qualify
anything regarding (1) E. granulosus s.l. infection of the defini￾tive host, and (2) AE and NE. With regards to a cystic lesion,
“CE cyst” should be preferred to “hydatid cyst” since the large
majority of voters preferred to use this term, and did not wish to
keep both names for E. granulosus s.l.-related cysts.
Although specialists of the genetics of Echinococcus spp.
rapidly agreed on the correct spelling of the species E. oligar￾thra on historical and linguistic arguments (and not oligarthrus,
as commonly spelled in the last few decades; see e.g., [5, 17]),
clinicians were more hesitant on the names of the diseases that
E. oligarthra and E. vogeli may cause in humans. There was no
term/expression entirely satisfactory to designate both diseases.
Because both are infections of the “tropical areas of the New
World”, “neotropical” has been commonly used in the scientific
literature and was presented at the WHO-Forum in 2015 to be
included among the U50-U99 “Codes for research and alterna￾tive subclassifications” of the International Statistical Code of
Diseases and Related Health Problems (https://apps.who.int/
iris/bitstream/handle/10665/246208/9789241549165-V2-eng.
pdf), as: U51X: “Infection due to Neotropical Echinococcosis”.
The suggestion of South American specialists, which was con￾firmed by the poll, was thus to keep this denomination. To avoid
the confusion with “polycystic liver and kidney disease”, a
genetic disease, the adjective “polycystic” (of Greek origin)
should definitively be replaced by “multicystic” (of Latin origin,
but with exactly the same meaning) when multiple aggregated
cysts are observed on imaging, regardless of the species; “multi￾ple cyst-” characterizes the co-existence of several separated and
independent cysts in the same organ or different organs.
It was agreed that the current international classifications
already approved by the WHO-IWGE, i.e. the “CE” classifica￾tion of CE cysts [82], and the PNM classification of AE lesions
[37], would not be questioned, and that further work on the
refinement of imaging classification of AE would not proceed
until fixing of international recommendations. However, an
unexpected and extremely useful outcome of the terminology
discussions was the agreement on a new and internationally
recognized system to describe surgical operations in CE, the
“AORC” framework (Fig. 3), with consensus on the single
word “cystectomy” to describe the removal of the CE cyst, thus
excluding “pericystectomy” when it consists of the removal of
the three layers of the cyst without “pericystic” liver. This
recommendation will help professionals to share a common
description that is relevant in terms of perioperative risks and
the risk of CE recurrence after operation. A precise description
of the procedure actually performed by the surgeon for a given
patient should accompany the mandatory terms (description of
the removed parasite layers, area in square centimeters or
percentage of cyst actually resected, closure of communications
with bile ducts, content of the cyst if it was opened, etc.); this is
beyond the objectives of a work on terminology and will be
further discussed in the “Technical Manual” for the diagnosis
and treatment of CE, which is currently being prepared by
the WHO-IWGE. For non-surgical CE interventions, the clear
distinction between the PAIR (puncture, aspiration, injection,
reaspiration, through a needle, without catheterization),
S-CAT (standard catheterization), and Mo-CAT (modified
catheterization) techniques provides accepted acronyms and
will also help professionals to better understand the specific
indications of each technique and the results of clinical trials.
The work in terminology aimed to cover all fields of echi￾nococcosis; it was the first attempt at standardizing scientific
and medical language in a specific area of parasitic disease –
echinococcosis. However, it did not claim to solve all points
of debate and/or to address everything definitively. The words
and expressions reported in Tables 1A–1C and 2A–2C do not
encompass all technical aspects; such details should be consid￾ered by subgroups of specialists. Regular updating will also be
necessary, following future advances in scientific and medical
knowledge. Apparently “easy-to-solve” dilemmas were in fact
more difficult to resolve when several disciplines reported on
their own usages. This was the case for the debate between
“daughter cyst” and “daughter vesicle”. Purists will certainly
regret that “daughter cyst” will stay in use, despite the paradox￾ical female gender, explained by the use of the feminine
“vésicule” (vesicle) in the first descriptions in French. Although
“daughter” is not justified in English, the alternative
adjective “secondary” cannot replace it since it is widely used
34 D.A. Vuitton et al.: Parasite 2020, 27, 41

to designate new cysts developed in the peritoneum, pleura or
meningeal space after cyst rupture and/or protoscolex spillage
Although “cyst” was not fully justified either, because it has
no fully developed adventitial layer, biologists readily agreed
to keep the noun “vesicle” with restricted use for the in vitro
situation. The results of the poll (Tables 1C and 2C) confirmed
the problematic nature of the issue: “daughter cyst” was not pre￾ferred, “daughter vesicle” was not either, and the alternative
expression “daughter hydatid” was unequivocally rejected; it
was thus agreed to keep the “historical wording”, i.e. “daughter
cyst”. We recommend the constitution of a permanent group on
“terminology” common to the WAE and the WHO-IWGE so
that such “unresolved” issues may be further discussed, and that
the certainly numerous new terms used in the field in the future
may be handled in a timely manner.
