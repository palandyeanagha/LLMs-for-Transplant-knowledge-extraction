Abstract
Background: Presepsin is useful for differentiating sepsis from non-infection related systemic inflammatory
response syndrome. However, there are no studies investigating the usefulness of presepsin in diagnosing sepsis
involving patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). The purpose of this study is to determine levels of blood presepsin
in patients with or without sepsis and among non-AKI patients or patients with different degrees of AKI severity.
Methods: This is a single center retrospective study. 247 patients admitted to the ICU between June 2010 and
October 2012 were analyzed for their presepsin levels. We classified the patients into non-AKI and AKI according to
the RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, and Loss of kidney function and End-stage kidney disease or simply Loss and ESKD)
criteria. We then sub-classified the patients in each group into either non-sepsis or sepsis sub-group and analyzed
the accuracy of diagnosing sepsis based on their levels of presepsin.
Results: The number of patients for each group was: non-AKI, 112; under AKI: Risk, 50; Injury, 36; Failure, 42; Loss
and ESKD, 7. The levels of presepsin in sepsis groups were significantly higher than that in the non-sepsis group
among the non-AKI, Risk and Injury patients (p < 0.0001, p < 0.01, p < 0.01, respectively). However, no significant
difference in the level of presepsin between non-sepsis and sepsis groups among patients with Failure. In the
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.784 in the non-AKI group
and 0.698 in the AKI comprising Risk, Injury and Failure groups. AUC value for non-AKI was not significantly
different from that of AKI (p = 0.200). When 670 pg/mL was used as the cutoff value for presepsin, sensitivity and
specificity were 70.3% and 81.3%, respectively. When 864 pg/mL was used as the cutoff value for presepsin,
sensitivity and specificity were 71.4% and 63.8%, respectively.
Conclusions: Presepsin level can be a reliable indicator of sepsis not only among non-AKI patients but also
patients with less severe forms of AKI. However, it may not be a reliable indicator of sepsis in patients with a more
advanced form of AKI.

Background
Since the definition of systemic inflammatory response
syndrome (SIRS) was proposed in 1991, several clinical tri￾als on sepsis diagnosis and treatment have been conducted
using the definition of sepsis given by the American
College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care
Medicine (ACCP/SCCM) [1]. Many studies have re￾ported that early treatment of sepsis using appropriate
antibiotics improved the prognosis and increased the
survival rate in severe sepsis or septic shock patients
[2-4]. Various biomarkers have been studied for diag￾nosing sepsis [5]. Currently, procalcitonin (PCT) is
used as a marker to diagnose sepsis or severe sepsis. In
comparison to other markers that have traditionally
been reported, PCT gives a high rate of specificity for
sepsis diagnosis [6]. However, the concentration of
PCT in the human blood is elevated in various condi￾tions, such as in severe trauma, surgical invasive pro￾cedures, and critical burn injury, which leads to SIRS.
It is also necessary to be aware of false-positive results
[7]. Therefore, more reliable biomarkers for the diagnosis
of sepsis are needed. Another marker is interleukin-6
(IL-6), which may be detectable in the early stages of * Correspondence: pdmxy827@yahoo.co.jp

infection and bacteremia [8,9]. Recently Endo et al. [10]
reported that presepsin is a highly specific marker for
diagnosis of bacterial infections in comparison to other
sepsis markers (PCT, IL-6). However, the presepsin levels
above the cutoff value in patients with chronic renal fail￾ure must be interpreted with caution. Additionally, there
are no studies investigating the usefulness of presepsin for
assessing patient with acute kidney injury (AKI). In this
study we attempted to clarify the diagnostic accuracy of
sepsis using the presepsin level according to AKI severity
of the patients.
Methods
This study was conducted as a single center retrospect￾ive study. In our hospital, patient’s extra blood samples
were stored for research purposes and informed consent
from patients taken. Whole blood was collected with
EDTA-2 K as an anticoagulant using a conventional blood
collection tube (TERUMO, Japan). Whenever extra blood
sample is available, the blood is centrifuged at 1400 g for
5 min and the serum kept at −70°C for future use. In this
present study, we enrolled all qualified patients with
available stored serum samples. The study protocol was
approved by the institutional review board of Fukuoka
University Hospital according to the Declaration of
Helsinki. The samples were from patients’ blood col￾lected 24 hr upon admission to the ICU of Fukuoka
University Hospital between June 2010 and October
2012. There were 247 patients with stored samples and
we included all for presepsin measurement. We grouped
the patients into non-AKI or AKI according to the RIFLE
(Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss of kidney function and End￾stage kidney disease: Loss and ESKD) criteria [11]. We
then classified patients in each group as either sepsis or
non-sepsis and analyzed the accuracy of diagnosing sepsis
based on the levels of presepsin. Sepsis diagnosis (include
severe sepsis and septic shock) was defined by ACCP/
SCCM Consensus Conference Committee [1]. Patients’
classification, enrollment into the study and exclusion
from the study are shown Figure 1.
Presepsin measurement
The frozen serum was allowed to melt to become liquid
at room temperature before presepsin testing. Presepsin
concentration in blood was measured with a compact
automated immunoanalyzer, PATHFAST®
, based on a chemi￾luminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA) (Mitsubishi
Chemical Medience, Japan) [12,13].

Classification of acute kidney injury
Oliguria and RIFLE were the most frequently used criteria
to define AKI. In particular, RIFLE criteria were formu￾lated to make a clearer classification of AKI among pa￾tients having renal problems [14]. Therefore, we used
RIFLE criteria for AKI diagnosis in this study.
The patient’s degree of AKI according to the RIFLE
criteria (Table 1) [11] is determined after the urine out￾put for the first 24 hr upon admission has been mea￾sured. RIFLE criteria involve measurement of blood
creatinine (Cr) and monitoring of 24 hr urine output to
classify patient’s state of renal injury. In this study, base￾line Cr was determined based on patient’s available rec￾ord prior to ICU admission or, if such record was not
available, the lowest level of Cr during the course of
ICU admission. To determine the AKI status of a pa￾tient, we used urine GFR criteria and urine output cri￾teria or, if the two differs, we used the one that gives a
more severe AKI classification.
Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
We calculated eGFR by using a Japanese equation [15].
For males: eGFR mL=min=1:73 m2 ð Þ¼ 194  ð Þ Serum Cr ‐1:094
 ð Þ Age ‐0:287
For females: eGFR mL=min=1:73 m2 ð Þ¼ 194  ð Þ Serum Cr ‐1:094
 ð Þ Age ‐0:287  0:739
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables are presented as median and range.
Groups were compared by Wilcoxon test. Analysis of
the values of area under curve (AUC) of receiver operat￾ing characteristic (ROC) curves was performed to deter￾mine the significance of presepsin levels in diagnosing
sepsis. The Youden index was used to identify the cutoff
values for presepsin levels that may have diagnostic sig￾nificance. Correlations between presepsin levels and Cr
or eGFR were evaluated by the Spearman’s rank test. All
statistical analyses in this study were performed using
JMP® version 10 and MedCalc® version 13. P value less
than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
There were 247 patients (141 men, 106 women) whose
median age was 70 (range: 18–96) years old enrolled in
this study. The underlying diseases of patients are shown
in Table 2. The number of sepsis patients is 122 (sepsis,
n = 30; severe sepsis, n = 40; septic shock, n = 52). The
results of the bacteriological examination in sepsis pa￾tients are shown in Table 3. One hundred and twelve pa￾tients were non-AKI and we classified the patients with
AKI according to the RIFLE criteria. Fifty patients were
classified Risk, 36 were Injury, 42 were Failure, and 7
were Loss and ESKD. The median level of presepsin was
300 pg/mL (range: 86–4374) in the non-AKI with non￾sepsis group (n = 75), 831 pg/mL (range: 187–9960) in
the non-AKI with sepsis group (n = 37); 467 pg/mL
(range: 71–3361) in the Risk non-sepsis group (n = 23),
924 pg/mL (range: 290–16759) in the sepsis group (n =
27); 517 pg/mL (range: 144–1197) in the Injury non￾sepsis group (n = 9), 1451 pg/mL (range: 237–4200) in
the sepsis group (n = 27). The presepsin levels in the
sepsis groups were significantly higher than the non￾sepsis groups (p < 0.0001, p < 0.01, p < 0.01, respectively).
The median level of presepsin was 1535 pg/mL (range:
454–8516) in the Failure non-sepsis group (n = 15) and
1523 pg/mL (range: 293–16764) in the sepsis group (n =
27). There was no significant differences in presepsin
levels between non-sepsis group and sepsis group (p =
0.300) in the Failure group (Figure 2). As for the accur￾acy of diagnosing sepsis based on the level of presepsin
in the ROC analysis, the AUC was 0.784 (95% CI: 0.683-
0.860) in the non-AKI group and 0.698 (95% CI: 0.593-
0.786) in the Risk, Injury and Failure groups combined
(Figure 3). The AUC value for non-AKI group was not
significantly different from that of AKI under Risk, In￾jury and Failure groups combined (p = 0.200). The Loss
& ESKD under AKI was excluded due to a very small
number of patients (n = 7) for statistical analysis, and
also due to abnormally high values of presepsin detected
in the samples (see Table 4). When 670 pg/mL was used
as a cutoff value for presepsin, sensitivity and specificity
were 70.4%, and 81.3%, respectively; and when 864 pg/
mL was used as a cutoff value for presepsin, sensitivity
and specificity were 71.3%, and 63.8%, respectively.

To determine how renal function affects presepsin
level, correlation between presepsin and Cr or eGFR was
evaluated using Spearman’s rank test. The results showed
that positive correlation between presepsin and Cr, and
negative correlation between presepsin and eGFR are sig￾nificantly similar between non-sepsis and sepsis groups
(Figure 4). This finding, in addition to the abnormally high
presepsin levels among patients with end-stage AKI,
suggests that the kidney is the main organ responsible
in clearing blood of presepsin.
Discussion
Presepsin is a 13-kDa protein that is a fragment of CD14
with truncated N-terminal, the receptor for lipopolysac￾charide (LPS)/LPS binding protein (LBP) complexes
[16,17]. An in vivo study using rabbit sepsis models
showed that presepsin level did not increase in the LPS￾induced sepsis model whereas elevation of presepsin level
was observed in a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) sepsis
model. It was speculated that the infectious stimulus led
to the elevation of presepsin level. One of the production
mechanisms of presepsin is related to the phagocytosis
process and cleavage of membrane CD14 with lysosomal
enzymes of granulocytes in an in vitro study using rabbit
peritoneal leukocyte [18]. The biological function of pre￾sepsin, however, remains unknown [17]. Recently, presep￾sin is considered a novel marker for the diagnosis of sepsis
that has been shown to increase in blood in the early
stages of sepsis [19]. A multicenter prospective study by
Endo et al. [10] showed that presepsin is a highly specific
marker for diagnosis of bacterial infections in comparison
to other sepsis markers (PCT, IL-6).
In the present study, we observed that presepsin was
significantly increased in sepsis patients with non-AKI
and patients with milder forms of AKI (Risk and Injury)
compared to non-sepsis groups. Furthermore, the me￾dian value of presepsin increased with increasing severity
of AKI both in the non-sepsis and sepsis groups. The
optimal cutoff value of presepsin in non-AKI group was
670 pg/mL (a result similar to that by Endo et al. [10])
while the optimal cutoff value of presepsin in the AKI
group (Risk, Injury and Failure groups combined) was
significantly higher at 864 pg/mL. However, when the
Failure group was separately analyzed, the result is that
presepsin levels among patients with sepsis are not sig￾nificantly different than those with non-sepsis in this
particular group of AKI patients. Despite the limited
number of patients in Loss and ESKD group, the levels
of presepsin were consistently and abnormally high in all
patients, whether they have sepsis or not (see Table 4).
It is therefore suggested that further study is needed to
establish cutoff value of presepsin for each level of AKI
severity to diagnose sepsis in these groups of patients.
As to how our body clears the blood of presepsin re￾mains unknown. In this study, our data show that there
is moderate positive correlation between presepsin and
Cr, and also moderate negative correlation between pre￾sepsin and eGFR in non-sepsis groups that were signifi￾cantly similar to that of the sepsis groups. These results
suggest that kidney is the major organ responsible in
eliminating presepsin from blood. Since renal function
could be considered a major determinant of presepsin

level, it is therefore logical that different thresholds of
presepsin levels (according to the status of renal function)
be applied to diagnose sepsis.
Many studies have reported that early treatment of sep￾sis using appropriate antibiotics improved the prognosis
and increased the survival rate in severe sepsis or septic
shock patients [2-4]. Moreover, patients with AKI are sus￾ceptible to many complications such as those that may be
caused by sepsis; and conversely, the most common cause
of AKI in critically ill patients is sepsis [20], thus making
early diagnosis and treatment of sepsis very important.
Blood culture is frequently used as the “gold standard”
diagnostic method for diagnosing sepsis. However, blood
culture usually takes 3 to 7 days to obtain the results and
frequently yields low true positive results [21]. Therefore,
in general practice, the decision to treat patient for sepsis
is based on the doctor’s own experience (empiric therapy).
Any quick tests that indicate sepsis will certainly improve
Figure 2 The comparison of the presepsin levels between non-sepsis and sepsis among non-AKI patients and patients with varying
degrees of AKI. Significant difference in presepsin levels between non-sepsis and sepsis patients were observed among non-AKI and AKI under
Risk and Injury groups. However, no significant deference was observed in AKI Failure group. No statistical comparison on the Loss & ESKD group
due to the small number of patients (n = 7) available and the abnormally high levels of presepsin detected in this group.

the physician’s changes of making the right diagnosis of
sepsis. Presepsin testing could be one of these tests. Pre￾sepsin levels in blood are known to increase in the first
6 hr after the onset of sepsis. These changes in concen￾tration occurred on a much faster time scale than those
observed for PCT or CRP [22]. The PATHFAST® pre￾sepsin assay reveals its result within 17 min. This is fas￾ter than the other methods of detecting presepsin by
ELISAs [22,23]. The PATHFAST® presepsin assay can be
performed using whole blood. Whole blood samples are
suitable for use in the emergency room, ICU, and the
surgical operation room, thus making this present study
on presepsin more meaningful.
Some limitations in our study deserve consideration.
First, this retrospective single center study only involved
a small number of samples; second, we did not compare
presepsin to other promising biomarkers of bacterial in￾fection that have been recently proposed, such as PCT
and IL-6; third, we did not consider the effect of cellular
immunity status of the patients (such as patients under
chemotherapy, steroids treatment, etc.) on presepsin level;
and fourth, bacterial culture was not considered in the
diagnosis of sepsis. Further studies are therefore needed to
address the limitations of this study cited above.
Conclusions
Blood presepsin level can be a reliable indicator of sepsis
not only among non-AKI patients but also patients with
less severe forms of AKI. However, it may not be a reliable
indicator of sepsis in patients with a more advanced form
of AKI, such as those classified under RIFLE criteria as
having failure of kidney function, loss of kidney function
and end-stage kidney disease.
