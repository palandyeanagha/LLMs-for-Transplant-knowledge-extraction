Controversy
Payment for living organ donation should be legalised
Amy L Friedman
Governments seem resistant to allowing live donors to benefit from their gift. But a legalised system
could solve organ shortages and be both safer and fairer
The demand for life saving organ transplantation has
so outpaced supply that waiting patients and
transplant teams are desperate. Improved survival rates
coupled with steady expansion of indications for trans￾plantation make the organ shortage progressively
severe; waiting times are now unbearably long.
Although legalisation of “presumed consent” strategies
has succeeded in raising organ donation rates in Spain
and elsewhere,1 other proposed solutions such as
voluntary reciprocal altruism2 remain cumbersome
and risk excluding people with poor healthcare
literacy.
Lack of donors has led to some patients
contracting with organ brokers to purchase a kidney
from a living donor. Because payment for organs is
illegal in most countries, people may travel to the
donor’s homeland for the transplantation.3 Limited
studies indicate possible exploitation of these paid
donors, who may get minimal benefit from their
purported financial compensation.4 More worrisome is
our lack of knowledge about adverse outcomes they
experience. If payment or reward for living donors can
be made legitimate and ethically consistent with other
accepted medical practices, exploitation can be
prevented and both donors and recipients can be
treated equitably.
Tangible benefits of living donor
transplantation
In 2005, United States transplant centres reported
6562 living donor kidney transplantations.5 It is
reasonable to assume that nearly all recipients who
survive surgery with a functioning kidney derive tangi￾ble benefit. But it is not only recipients who benefit.
Recipients of donated organs are able to live without
dialysis. Thus their family members have liberalised
lifestyles and may benefit from extra income if the
recipient returns to work. Doctors will be paid for each
transplantation. And other hospital staff, such as
administrators and transplant coordinators, whose
jobs depend on the volume of transplantations, will
validate their effectiveness by satisfying job require￾ments. Transplant programmes and their home
institutions gain higher case volumes, which improves
their reputation and gives them a competitive
advantage.6 Taxpayers might also benefit financially
because the support of a kidney transplant recipient is
less costly than haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.7
Furthermore, many recipients will restart work and pay
taxes.
In contrast, living donors are prohibited by law
from receiving “valuable consideration” in exchange
for their gift. Although US donors’ immediate medical
care is covered by the recipients’ insurance, donors
have to pay costs of travel to the site of transplantation
and get no compensation for lost wages.8 Concern that
these costs might stop people donating led to incorpo￾ration of pilot grants in the signed but still unfunded
Organ Donation and Recovery Improvement Act of
2004. Interestingly, the only non-psychologically
derived donor benefit occurs if a previous donor needs
a kidney transplant. The allocation regulations for
organs from deceased donors give priority to
candidates on the waiting list who have given whole or
segments of organs.9 This represents a societal
determination that an individual’s act of donation is
morally deserving of tangible reward.

Financial rewards for other uses of the
human body
Payment for donation of other bodily material is legal
in the US (table). Sale of regenerative products such as
hair, blood, and semen has minimal medical risk for
the donor. It is accepted that they are sold for financial
gain, with disproportionate representation of the
economically disadvantaged. Legal and ethical conse￾quences of misleading buyers about the risks of disease
transmission (blood, sperm) or genetic legacies
(sperm) make this process increasingly complex.
Human eggs are now widely sought for assisted
reproduction. Although donors are sought openly for
lucrative prices ($8000 (£4200; €6200) per collection
in one April 2006 advertisement),13 they are rarely fully
educated about the risks such as ovarian hyperstimula￾tion, ovarian cancer, and future infertility.14 Egg
donation requires both prolonged hormonal manipu￾lation and an invasive procedure, so has traditionally
appealed only to emotionally (or genetically) related
donors or women in financial need, such as university
students. The chief differences between donating an
egg and donating a kidney are the degree of risk of
morbidity and mortality associated with the procure￾ment process; the size of the donor’s residual reserve;
and the fact that only women can donate an egg.
Use of the intact, functional body for the purposes
of pregnancy or sexual gratification entails greater risk.
Legalisation of prostitution has been advocated in
order to reduce both crime and disease related risks
and to eliminate the exploitation by third parties
(pimps). Although many people spurn these argu￾ments, prostitution is legal in several European
countries and at least one US state. By contrast, rental
of a surrogate mother’s uterus for a pregnancy is legal
throughout the US, with fees as high as $30 000. The
substantial risks to the surrogate mother, including
transfusion, visceral prolapse, urinary incontinence,
death, and immunological sensitisation, make notable
parallels with the purchase of a kidney from a living
donor. Has the ethical acceptance of payment for sur￾rogate motherhood been influenced by impassioned,
articulate, assertive, and wealthy people who want to be
parents? Or do we believe that the drive to procreate
justifies donor risks?
Unquestionably, the strongest parallel can be
drawn with payments to volunteer participants in
research studies. Without payment it is unlikely that
sufficient people would volunteer. Solicitations are
openly advertised and condoned by regulatory bodies
responsible for the supervision of human investiga￾tions. The same university newspaper that carried the
advertisement for egg donors contained 23 advertise￾ments for study participants, ranging from healthy
adults to smokers, obese people, and even children
younger than 3 years old. Although most of these
research protocols entail safe interventions, any inves￾tigation conducted to advance medicine and science
may result in unexpected and even catastrophic events,
as shown by recent cases in the US and UK.15 16 If it is
reasonable, legal, and ethically justified to motivate
someone using monetary reward to participate in
human research, then by extension the same person
should be allowed a monetary inducement or reward
for donating an organ.
How would it work?
To protect potential donors, regulation and payment
must be governed by a balanced, objective, and
multidisciplinary body. Organ donation should be
limited to the country’s legal residents, but family
members should not necessarily be excluded from
donation solely because of lack of residency. The
exclusion of other non-resident donors will limit
exploitation of people from low income countries.17
The regulatory body should determine standardised
criteria for donors and recipients, as well as a uniform
fee. Local panels comprised of representatives from
linked transplant centres, similar to those already in
existence for heart and liver transplantation, would
adjudicate on individual applications not clearly meet￾ing the accepted protocols.
Equitable access
Opponents of payments to living organ donors focus
on several issues. The immediate past president of the
United Network for Organ Sharing, Francis Del￾monico, suggests that the kidney shortage is driven by
societal failure to prevent preventable renal disease.18 I
agree that we need to improve the quality of care to all
members of society. However, it seems unfair to
penalise people who have already developed disease as
a consequence of the flawed care they were powerless
to improve or to ask patients to wait for ideal medical
care that seems unattainable. This is particularly true
for people who are economically or ethnically
disadvantaged, among whom the rates of end stage
renal disease are disproportionately high. If this
approach was reasonable, people with sexually
transmitted diseases and women carrying unwanted
pregnancies ought to be denied the benefits of care
because they have not taken appropriate precautions.
There is little dignity in dying without access to a medi￾cal treatment that is known to have a high likelihood of
prolonging life.
A compelling argument, that money in exchange
for an organ would exploit the most needy, was coun￾tered by Anthony Monaco, a past president of the
American Society of Transplant Surgeons.19 Monaco
noted that developed societies have already become
comfortable with the use of tangible recognition for
personal self sacrifice that is most likely to flow to the
needy. If military service can be recognised with
inducements such as paid education, enlistment
bonuses, and financial recovery for injury or mortality,

why should the decision to donate an organ be viewed
differently?
At the moment, kidneys are covertly transplanted
in third world countries, from indigent donors into
wealthy recipients. Bringing these activities out of the
closet by introducing governmental supervision and
funding will provide equity for the poor, who will get
equal access to such transplants. It is appropriate that
living donors, indigent or wealthy, share in the tangible
benefits of their ethical concern for others. Not doing
so, effectively restricting the disadvantaged, is un￾reasonably disingenuous.

Medical education
Trust, competence, and the supervisor’s role in
postgraduate training
Olle ten Cate
The decision to trust a trainee to manage a critically ill patient is based on much more than tests of
competence. How can these judgments be incorporated into assessments?
Competency based postgraduate medical pro￾grammes are spreading fairly rapidly in response to
the new demands of health care. In the past 10 years,
Canada, the United States, the Netherlands, and the
United Kingdom have introduced competency models
and other countries are following.1–5 These frameworks
are valuable, as they renew our thinking about the
qualities of doctors that really matter.
Paramount in these developments is the view that
quality of training should be reflected in the quality of
the outcome—that is, the performance of its graduates.
As postgraduate training almost fully focuses on learn￾ing in practice, training and assessment moves around
the top two levels of Miller’s hierarchical framework for
clinical assessment (figure).6 Knowledge and applied
knowledge of residents may be interesting, but
performance in practice is the real thing. The question
is: How can we assess it?
Competence does not necessarily predict
performance
Competency based training suggests that competence
and competencies are what we want trainees to attain.
But is this the same as performance? If a doctor is
competent, what happens if she does not perform
according to her assessed competence? Most authors
agree that performance involves more than
Summary points
The severe organ shortage has generated
desperation among people awaiting
transplantation
A black market for kidneys purchased from living
donors exists despite prohibitory laws
Everyone but the donor derives tangible benefit
from a living donor transplant
Controlled, regulated compensation to living
organ donors should be permitted as with
donation of other body material
Legalised donation is likely to improve safety for
both donors and recipients
