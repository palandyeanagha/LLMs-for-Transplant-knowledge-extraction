Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) patients have recurrent life-threatening bacterial and fungal infec￾tions. Olfactomedin 4 (OLFM4) is a neutrophil granule protein that negatively regulates host defense against 
bacterial infection. The goal of this study was to evaluate the impact of Olfm4 deletion on host defense against 
Staphylococcus aureus and Aspergillus fumigatus in a murine X-linked gp91phox-deficiency CGD model. We found 
that intracellular killing and in vivo clearance of S. aureus, as well as resistance to S. aureus sepsis, were sig￾nificantly increased in gp91phox and Olfm4 double-deficient mice compared with CGD mice. The activities of 
cathepsin C and its downstream proteases (neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G) and serum levels of IL-1β, 
IL-6, IL-12p40, CXCL2, G-CSF, and GM-CSF in Olfm4-deficient as well as gp91phox and Olfm4 double-deficient 
mice were significantly higher than those in WT and CGD mice after challenge with S. aureus. We did not 
observe enhanced defense against A. fumigatus in Olfm4-deficient mice using a lung infection model. These 
results show that Olfm4 deletion can successfully enhance immune defense against S. aureus, but not A. fumi￾gatus, in CGD mice. These data suggest that OLFM4 may be an important target in CGD patients for the aug￾mentation of host defense against bacterial infection.
Introduction
Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) comprises a group of reces￾sive inherited disorders characterized by recurrent life-threatening 
bacterial and fungal infections with granuloma formation (1). The 
disease results from mutations in any one of four subunits of the 
respiratory burst oxidase (NADPH oxidase) found in phagocytic leu￾kocytes. Two-thirds of CGD cases are due to X-linked gp91phox defi￾ciency (2). NADPH oxidase generates superoxide, the precursor to 
hydrogen peroxide and other reactive oxygen derivatives with micro￾bicidal activity (3). The relative resistance of microbes to nonoxida￾tive killing mechanisms, such as defensins, bactericidal/permeabil￾ity-increasing factor, lactoferrin (4), and other lysosomal proteases, 
may also play a role in the distinctive pattern of microbial infection 
seen in CGD (5). The delivery of superoxide by the NADPH oxidase 
complex into the phagosome is also thought to indirectly activate 
several classes of proteases by increasing K+ influx and pH (6).
Olfactomedin 4 (OLFM4) is a member of the olfactomedin 
domain–containing glycoprotein family whose expression is 
known to be regulated by G-CSF, PU.1, and NF-κB (7). OLFM4 
is stored in the granules of mature neutrophils (8). Recent func￾tion studies revealed that OLFM4 is an important modifier of 
neutrophil bacterial killing and host innate immunity against 
Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Staphylococ￾cus aureus, Escherichia coli (8), and Helicobacter pylori (9). These fea￾tures are mediated through its restriction on neutrophil cathep￾sin C–mediated protease activities (8) and nucleotide-binding 
oligomerization domain–mediated (NOD-mediated) NF-κB acti￾vation (9). NADPH oxidase–mediated bacterial killing is totally 
abolished in CGD patients. Here, we hypothesize that deletion of 
Olfm4 in CGD neutrophils may restore microbe-killing activities 
through nonoxidative mechanisms.
Results and Discussion
In normal neutrophils, microorganisms are killed by the combined 
action of oxygen-dependent and oxygen-independent mecha￾nisms. CGD neutrophils possess only oxygen-independent mecha￾nisms, and killing mainly depends on the microbicidal effect of the 
neutrophil granule proteins (5). In this study, we first investigated 
whether deletion of Olfm4, a negative modulator of host defense 
against bacterial infection, could boost X-linked CGD mouse 
immunity against S. aureus, a commonly encountered pathogen 
in CGD patients. X-CGD mice have a null allele for gp91phox and 
are similar to patients with CGD in that they manifest impaired 
resistance to infections with S. aureus and Aspergillus fumigatus (10). 
Nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction assays (Figure 1A) and 
superoxide burst assays (Figure 1B) confirmed the lack of NADPH 
oxidase activity in gp91phox-deficient mice.
We first crossed gp91phox-deficient mice with Olfm4-deficient 
mice to create gp91phox and Olfm4 double-deficient mice. These 
double-deficient mice demonstrated normal development and 
growth without symptoms of colitis or skin disease. We then ana￾lyzed neutrophils derived from the bone marrow of mice with 
different genotypes for their intracellular killing of two strains of 
S. aureus: Rosenbach and USA300/LAC, the latter of which is a methi￾cillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). In both strains, the neutrophils 
from gp91phox+/+Olfm4–/– (Olfm4-deficient) mice demonstrated 
increased capability to kill intracellular S. aureus, while neutrophils 
from gp91phox–/–Olfm4+/+ (CGD) mice had decreased bacterial-kill￾Authorship note: Wenli Liu and Ming Yan contributed equally to this work.

ing ability compared with those from gp91phox+/+Olfm4+/+ (WT) 
mice (Figure 1C). The bacterial-killing abilities in gp91phox–/–
Olfm4–/– (double-deficient) neutrophils were restored to the levels 
of those from WT mice (Figure 1C). Neutrophils from gp91phox–/–
Olfm4+/– and gp91phox–/–Olfm4+/+ (CGD) mice demonstrated a simi￾lar level of bacterial killing (Figure 1C). We then performed in vivo 
peritoneal S. aureus clearance assays for the two strains among 
different genotypes of mice. Similarly, Olfm4–/– (Olfm4-deficient) 
mice had increased in vivo peritoneal S. aureus clearance, and 
gp91phox–/– Olfm4+/+ (CGD) mice had decreased bacterial-clearance 
ability. In addition, double-deficient mice had enhanced in vivo 
bacterial clearance abilities compared with CGD mice and demon￾strated a similar level of bacterial clearance ability to that of WT 
mice (Figure 1D). These results indicate that a homozygous dele￾tion of the Olfm4 gene in CGD mice could enhance CGD mouse 
S. aureus killing and in vivo clearance.
Next, we investigated whether deletion of Olfm4 in CGD mice 
could increase the host defense against systemic infections of 
S. aureus and A. fumigatus, the latter of which is another common 
pathogen in CGD patients. Mice of various genotypes were infected 
with S. aureus of Rosenbach or USA300 by i.p. injection, and their 
survival was monitored. All CGD mice and gp91phox–/–Olfm4+/– mice 
died within 2 to 5 days (Figure 2A). Most WT mice died gradually 
during a 2-week observation period. In contrast, almost all the 
Olfm4-deficient and gp91phox and Olfm4 double-deficient mice sur￾vived. Consistent with our earlier observations, these results sug￾gest that a homozygous, but not a heterozygous, deletion of Olfm4 
could increase host system defense against S. aureus infection and 
prevent S. aureus sepsis-induced mortality in CGD mice.
Pulmonary aspergillus infection is the most common micro￾bial cause of death in CGD patients, and NADPH oxidase–defi￾cient mice are also susceptible to experimental aspergillus chal￾lenge (11). Therefore, we wanted to determine whether OLFM4 
is involved in the mouse host defense against A. fumigatus using 
a lung infection model. Following oropharyngeal challenge with 
a moderate inoculum (5 × 105 conidia per mouse), CGD, dou￾ble-deficient, and gp91phox–/–Olfm4+/– mice all died within 9 days, 
whereas WT and Olfm4-deficient mice all survived (Figure 2B).

These results showed that Olfm4 deletion did not prevent pul￾monary A. fumigatus infection-induced death in CGD mice. We 
also evaluated host immune response in Olfm4–/– mice compared 
with WT mice 24 hours after a high A. fumigatus inoculum (1 × 107
conidia per mouse). Bronchoalveolar fluid leukocytosis was not 
significantly different between the two genotypes (Supplemental 
Figure 1A; supplemental material available online with this arti￾cle; doi:10.1172/JCI68453DS1). No significant difference between 
the two genotypes was observed in the quantitative fungal burden 
in the lungs (Supplemental Figure 1B) or in the Grocott-Gomori 
methenamine-silver staining in lung sections (Supplemental Fig￾ure 1C). Lung histology showed a similar level of inflammation 
characterized by peribronchial and perivascular inflammatory 
cell infiltration, including neutrophils and mononuclear cells, in 
Olfm4–/– and WT mice (Supplemental Figure 1D). Taken together, 
these results suggest that OLFM4 may not play a role in the mouse 
host defense against pulmonary aspergillosis.
Neutrophils from gp91phox-deficient mice or CGD patients have 
impaired fungicidal activity, and the generation of ROS by neu￾trophils is considered to be the major antifungal mechanism lack￾ing in CGD (12). Although evidence suggests that neutrophils can 
mediate antifungal activities via nonoxidative mechanisms, includ￾ing defensins (13), lactoferrin (4), and pentraxins (14), neutrophils 
from CGD patients do not cause substantial damage to hyphae in 
vitro (15), suggesting that cellular nonoxidative mechanisms alone 
are insufficient to kill hyphae under physiologic conditions. It has 
been reported that A. fumigatus was markedly resistant to neutrophil 
granule extract (5). Neutrophils use oxygen-dependent mechanisms 
to attack hyphae germinating from conidia that escape alveolar 
macrophage surveillance (16). A recent study demonstrated that 
neutrophil proteases and cathepsin C, which are important for bac￾terial innate immunity (17, 18), do not play a role in mouse host 
defense against pulmonary aspergillosis (11). Because OLFM4 reg￾ulates bacterial killing largely through modulation of cathepsin C 
and neutrophil proteases in the granules (8), this may explain why 
Olfm4 deletion did not alter the mice’s defense against A. fumigatus, 
but led to enhanced host defense against S. aureus. These results sup￾port the conclusion that NADPH oxidase and neutrophil proteases 
have distinct antibacterial and antifungal functions.
To explore the mechanism through which Olfm4 deletion 
enhanced the bactericidal activities of CGD neutrophils, we ana￾lyzed the activities of cathepsin C and its downstream proteases 
(neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G) in the neutrophils from mice 
after S. aureus challenge. Cathepsin C activity in the neutrophils of 
Olfm4-deficient mice and double-deficient mice was significantly 
higher than that in WT mouse neutrophils, while cathepsin C 
activity in CGD (gp91phox–/–Olfm4+/+) and gp91phox–/–Olfm4+/–
mice was similar to that in WT mice (Figure 3A). Accordingly, 
the neutrophil elastase (Figure 3B) and cathepsin G (Figure 3C) 
activities in Olfm4-deficient and double-deficient mice were also 
substantially higher than those in WT mice as well as in CGD and 
gp91phox–/–Olfm4+/– mice. These results suggest that the increase in 
serine protease activities observed with Olfm4 deletion is NADPH 
independent. The compromised neutrophil bacterial killing and 
host innate immunity against S. aureus in CGD mice due to oxi￾dative mechanism deficiency could be successfully restored by the 
enhancement of serine protease activities in neutrophils subse￾quent to Olfm4 deletion. Serine proteases are stored in granules 
in their active form until they are released following neutrophil 
exposure to inflammatory stimuli. Once released, neutrophil ser￾ine proteases are potentially fully active and have broad biological 
effects, including intracellular microbial killing and modulation 
of inflammatory cell recruitment (19).
A previous study showed that OLFM4 binds NOD1 and NOD2 
and inhibits NOD-mediated NF-κB signaling (9). Here, we ana￾lyzed cytokine and chemokine levels in the serum of mice following 
challenge with S. aureus. The levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12p40, CXCL2, 
G-CSF, and GM-CSF were significantly higher in the Olfm4-deficient 
mice as well as in the gp91phox and Olfm4 double-deficient mice than 
the levels in WT and CGD mice (Figure 3D). All of these cytokines

and chemokines are known target genes of the NF-κB pathway. 
We consistently found that NF-κB activity in the neutrophils from 
Olfm4-deficient as well as gp91phox and Olfm4 double-deficient mice 
was significantly higher than that in WT and CGD mice (Supple￾mental Figure 2). The enhanced cytokine levels in Olfm4-deficient 
mice could be caused by the upregulated NF-κB signaling as well as 
by increased serine protease activities. Neutrophil serine proteases 
might not only regulate the activity of chemokines and cytokines by 
proteolysis, but might also modulate their release through cellular 
activation (19). NOD2 is critical for innate recognition and anti￾bacterial defense against S. aureus (20, 21). Therefore, the enhanced 
NOD-mediated defense pathways caused by Olfm4 deletion may also 
contribute to the enhanced host defense against S. aureus in CGD.
NOD signaling works synergistically with TLR signaling to rec￾ognize S. aureus infection and induce inflammatory responses (22). 
The TLR2-MyD88 pathway has been recognized to play important 
roles in mouse innate immunity against S. aureus infection (23). To 
determine whether the effect of Olfm4 deletion on S. aureus immune 
defense is mediated through the TLR-MyD88 pathway, we inves￾tigated the host defense of MyD88 and Olfm4 double-deficient 
mice against S. aureus systemic infection. While the MyD88-defi￾cient mice were highly susceptible to S. aureus infection, additional 
Olfm4 elimination remarkably improved the survival of MyD88-
deficient mice and enhanced the serum levels of some NF-κB–tar￾geted pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (Supplemen￾tal Figure 3). These results suggest that enhanced mouse innate

immunity due to Olfm4 deletion is TLR-MyD88 signal independent 
and that NOD-mediated NF-κB may play an important role. The 
mechanism of OLFM4 regulation of host immune defense against 
S. aureus is summarized in Supplemental Figure 4.
Taken together, we found that deletion of Olfm4, a critical neg￾ative regulator of neutrophil protease activities and the NOD￾mediated pathway, could enhance the immune defense against 
S. aureus infection in CGD mice. This finding provides a rationale 
for enhancing CGD patient defense against bacterial infections 
potentially through the modulation of OLFM4 levels.
Methods
Further information can be found in Supplemental Methods.
Mice, bacteria, and fungi. X-linked gp91phox-deficient mice on a C57BL/6 
background were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. Olfm4-
deficient mice backcrossed six generations onto a C57BL/6 background 
were described previously (8). Olfm4 and gp91phox–double-deficient 
mice were derived from crossing Olfm4-deficient and gp91phox-deficient 
mice. Animals were kept in a specific pathogen-free facility at the NIH. 
All experiments were conducted with 8- to 10-week-old male animals. 
S. aureus (Rosenbach) ATCC 10390 was purchased from ATCC, and S. aureus
(USA300/LAC) was provided by Frank R. DeLeo of the NIH. Bacteria were 
grown in tryptic soy broth or on tryptic soy agar plates (Teknova). A. fumi￾gatus strain B-5233, a pulmonary clinical isolate from a leukemic patient, 
was maintained on Aspergillus minimal medium (4). Conidia were harvested 
from 1-week-old cultures with PBS and quantitated on a hematocytometer. 
Intracellular bacterial-killing assay. Purification of bone marrow–derived 
mouse neutrophils and the bacterial-killing assay were performed as 
described previously (8).
Protease activity assays. The assays were performed as previously described 
(8) with minor modifications. Cathepsin C activity was assayed in 25 mM 
2-ethanesulfonic acid (MES), pH 6.0, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, and 0.1% 
polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350 using Gly-Arg-AMC (Bachem) at 10 μM. 
Neutrophil elastase (NE) activity was assayed in 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5,
