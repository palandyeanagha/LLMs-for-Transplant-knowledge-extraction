Abstract
OBJECTIVE To assess longitudinal changes in systemic ventricular


diastolic function late after the Fontan procedure.
DESIGN AND PATIENTS Prospective study of 13 patients at 2.8
(2.0) years (early) and again at 11.4 (2.0) years (late) after the
Fontan procedure by Doppler echocardiography with simultaneous
ECG, phonocardiogram, and respirometer.
SETTING Tertiary paediatric cardiac centre.
RESULTS The isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT) was significantly
longer, and E wave deceleration time, E and A wave velocities, and
E:A velocity ratio were reduced compared to normal both early and
late after the procedure. The mean (SD) z score of IVRT decreased
significantly from +2.50 (1.00) to +1.24 (0.80) (p = 0.002), and
the z score of the E wave deceleration time decreased from −1.69
(1.31) to −2.40 (1.47) (p = 0.03) during follow up. The A wave
deceleration time also tended to decrease (early 80 (12) ms v late 73
(11) ms, p = 0.13) with increased follow up. There were no changes
of the E and A wave velocities and E:A velocity ratio. The E wave
velocity was inversely related to IVRT both early (r = −0.82, p = 
0.001) and late (r = −0.59, p = 0.034) after the operation. The
prevalence of diastolic flow during isovolumic relaxation decreased
from 85% (11/13) to 38% (5/13) (p = 0.04), while that of mid
diastolic flow increased from 23% (3/13) to 77% (10/13) (p = 
0.02) between the two assessments.
CONCLUSIONS Left ventricular diastolic function remains highly
abnormal late after the Fontan procedure. The longitudinal changes
demonstrated on follow up are compatible with reduction of left
ventricular compliance in addition to persisting abnormalities of
relaxation.
