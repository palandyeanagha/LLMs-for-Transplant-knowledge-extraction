Abstract
Rationale: Optimal management of complicated parapneumonic effusions (CPPE) remains controversial.
Objectives: to assess safety and efficacy of iterative therapeutic thoracentesis (ITTC), the first-line treatment of CPPE in
Rennes University Hospital.
Methods: Patients with CPPE were identified through our computerized database. We retrospectively studied all cases of
CPPE initially managed with ITTC in our institution between 2001 and 2010. ITTC failure was defined by the need for
additional treatment (i.e. surgery or percutaneous drainage), or death.
Results: Seventy-nine consecutive patients were included. The success rate was 81% (n = 64). Only 3 patients (4%) were
referred to thoracic surgery. The one-year survival rate was 88%. On multivariate analysis, microorganisms observed in
pleural fluid after Gram staining and first thoracentesis volume $450 mL were associated with ITTC failure with adjusted
odds-ratios of 7.65 [95% CI, 1.44–40.67] and 6.97 [95% CI, 1.86–26.07], respectively. The main complications of ITTC were
iatrogenic pneumothorax (n = 5, 6%) and vasovagal reactions (n = 3, 4%). None of the pneumothoraces required chest tube
drainage, and no hemothorax or re-expansion pulmonary edema was observed.
Conclusions: Although not indicated in international recommendations, ITTC is safe and effective as first-line treatment of
CPPE, with limited invasiveness.

Introduction
Pleural infection is a common clinical problem associated with
significant morbidity and mortality [1,2]. Most guidelines recom￾mend that complicated parapneumonic effusions (CPPE) be
evacuated, in addition to appropriate antibiotics [3], but the
optimal evacuation method remains controversial and poorly
standardized. Current options include iterative therapeutic thora￾centesis (ITTC), chest tube drainage, video-assisted thoracoscopic
surgery (VATS), or thoracotomy. [4–6]. Few randomized studies
compared evacuation methods in CPPE, but no consensus could
be reached from these studies, due to their limited sample size, and
heterogeneity [5,7].
In our department, ITTC has long been the first-line treatment
to remove infected pleural fluid in CPPE, in association with
systemic antibiotics. The theoretical benefits associated with this
procedure include shorter immobilization, and limited use of
thromboprophylaxis and analgesics, as compared to chest tube
drainage or surgery.
We report our experience of systematic use of ITTC as first-line
treatment in CPPE, focusing on efficacy, tolerability, and risk
factors for failure.
Methods
Patients
We performed an observational study of all consecutive patients
managed with ITTC as first-line treatment for CPPE in the
Rennes University Hospital, France, during years 2001–2010.
Other aetiologies (i.e. surgery, trauma, mediastinal or sub￾diaphragmatic primary infections) were excluded from this study,
as well as non-complicated parapneumonic effusions. We included
all patients with at least one of the following characteristic for
pleural fluid: frank pus (empyema), micro-organisms observed
after Gram staining, pH ,7.2, glucose level ,2.2 mmol/L,
loculations or profuse effusion [5,6].
The study was approved by the Rennes University Hospital
Ethics Committee (project approval number 12.52) which waived
the informed consent.

ITTC Protocol
The ITTC protocol was standardized in our department.
Thoracentesis were performed at bedside under local anaesthesia
(lidocain 1%) using 8- or 10-French disposable pleural needle
(NovatechH, La Ciotat, France). Each evacuation was maximal,
until no more liquid was aspirated, or until the patient could no
longer tolerate the thoracentesis (irrepressible cough, chest pain, or
vagal faintness). Thoracentesis were repeated every 1 to 3 days
until major decrease of the pleural opacity on chest X-ray and/or
until no more pleural fluid could be aspirated. A chest X-ray was
performed after each thoracentesis. Intrapleural fibrinolysis
protocol was standardized, based on urokinase (EumedicaH,
Biarritz, France), 100 000 UI in 50 mL of saline, instilled in the
pleural space via the pleural needle at the end of thoracentesis.
Fibrinolysis was contra-indicated in patients at risk of severe
haemorrhagic events, as recommended. The decision of using
intrapleural fibrinolysis was left to the physician in charge.
Failure of Management with ITTC
Failure of ITTC was defined by the need to escalate therapy (i.e.
chest tube drainage or thoracic surgery), or death due to sepsis.
Data Collection
Demographic, clinical, biological and radiological data, espe￾cially characteristics of pleural fluid and thoracentesis; and data
related to complications and to patients’ vital status were collected
from medical records using a standardized questionnaire. Physi￾cians blinded to clinical data reviewed chest X-ray and CT-scan,
and collected data on the location and quantity of pleural effusion,
the existence of a mediastinal shift, and loculations. Pain was
estimated through the use of analogic visual scale when performed,
and through the prescription of analgesics.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using SASH version 9.3
software. Two-tailed p-values were reported, with p,0.05
considered as statistically significant.
A descriptive analysis with medians and 25th and 75th
percentiles (IQR) for quantitative variables, and absolute and
relative frequencies for qualitative variables were performed. The
global survival rate of the cohort was estimated using the Kaplan￾Meier estimator. The association between the ITTC outcomes
and the characteristics of both patients and ITTC procedures was
then studied using the Fischer exact test or the Pearson chi￾squared test, and the Mann-Whitney U test. Finally, a binomial
logistic model was built with the ITTC outcomes as dependent
variable, and the overall significant variables associated with the
ITTC outcomes in bivariate analysis. Factors with more than 10%
of missing data were excluded from the multivariate analysis, and
quantitative variables were first categorized in quartile.
Results
Patients Characteristics
Seventy-nine consecutive patients were included. Patients and
pleural fluids’ characteristics are described in Table 1 and 2.
Median age was 54 years (IQR 46–71), and male-to-female sex
ratio was 2.59. Most infections were community-acquired (n = 72,
91%). The most frequent comorbidities were alcohol abuse
(n = 25, 32%), and neurological disorders (n = 25, 32%). Only
32% of patients did not have any comorbidity.
Loculations were observed on chest X-ray and/or CT scan in
47 (66%) of patients. At least one microbiological documentation
was obtained in 45 (57%) patients, from pleural fluid, blood
culture, or pneumococcal urinary antigen.
Fifteen patients (19%) were classified as ‘failure’ of the ITTC
strategy, including 12 (15%) who were cured by chest tube
drainage, and 3 (4%) who finally required surgical drainage.
Iterative Therapeutic Thoracenteses (ITTC)
ITTC modalities are detailed in Table 3. The median number
of thoracenteses was 3 [IQR 2–5]. The median duration of ITTC
management was 8 [IQR 4–15] days and the median delay
between admission and first therapeutic thoracentesis was 1 [IQR
0–4] day. Blank thoracenteses were observed in 23 (29%) patients.
Ultrasonography-guidance was performed in 42 (53%) patients,
and intrapleural fibrinolysis in 52 (66%) patients. Median total
volume of pleural fluid removed was 875 mL [IQR 500–1600].
Median duration of antibiotics was 18.5 days [IQR 11–32] for
intravenous use, and 47 days [IQR 38–56] when oral treatment
was taken into account.
Complications
Most frequent complications of ITTC included 5 (6%)
iatrogenic pneumothoraces and 3 (4%) vagal faintness (Table 4).
No pneumothorax required chest tube drainage, and no re￾expansion oedema was observed. We did not observe any allergic
reaction related to fibrinolytic agent and no hemothorax.
However, two major haemorrhagic events occurred (hemoptysis,
and gastrointestinal bleeding, one patient each). The median
hospital length of stay was 21 days [IQR 14–34]. The median
duration of fever was 10 days [IQR 7–15] in total and 7.5 days
[IQR 4–13] after the first thoracentesis. Thirteen patients (16%)
were admitted in intensive care unit.
Survival
Three patients (4%) died during hospitalisation and the one
year survival rate was estimated at 88.8% [95% CI, 81.8–96.5]
(Fig. 1). All early death but one (septic shock) occurred in patients
under palliative care due to end-stage comorbidities.
Predictive Factors of ITTC Failure
Four variables were significantly associated with ITTC failures
(Table 5): mediastinal shift (p = 0.016), positive anaerobic culture
(p = 0.036), micro-organisms observed after Gram staining in
pleural fluid (p = 0.003), and volume of the first thoracentesis
$450 mL (p = 0.009).
After fitting the data within the logistic model, only two
covariates remained associated with the failures of ITTC (Table 5):
micro-organisms observed after Gram staining in pleural fluid
(OR = 7.65 [95% CI = 1.44–40.67]) and volume of first thoracen￾tesis $450 mL [95% CI = 1.86–26.07]).
Discussion
We analysed 79 consecutive patients with complicated para￾pneumonic effusion (CPPE) managed with iterative therapeutic
thoracentesis (ITTC). Our success rate was 81%, with in-hospital
mortality at 4%, and a need for secondary surgery in less than 4%
of cases. The median number of thoracentesis needed to achieve
cure was 3. Factors associated with failure of ITTC on
multivariate analysis were the observation of microorganisms after
Gram staining on pleural fluid, and volume of the first
thoracentesis $450 mL.
Demographic data from our study (median age 54 years, 72%
male) and prevalence of comorbidities (68%) are comparable to
other studies dealing with CPPE [8–13]. Likewise, the high

prevalence of empyema (66%), and loculations (66%) are in
agreement with previous studies [13,14]. The relatively low yield
of conventional microbiology in pleural fluid is well known [13,14]
and our study highlights the same results, in these settings where
patients are frequently on antibiotics before the first thoracentesis
(47% of cases in our study). The advent of molecular identification
techniques is likely to expand the rate of CPPE with microbio￾logical documentation [15].
In our series, 81% of patients with CPPE could be cured with
the combination of antibiotics and ITTC, and did not require
chest tube drainage or surgery. The success rates of ITTC are
highly variable in the literature, ranging from 2.4% to 100%
(Table 6). This variability may be explained by i) differences in
patient characteristics; ii) use of heterogeneous protocols (e.g.
systematic daily thoracentesis until resolution, versus additional
thoracentesis based on clinical and radiological criteria; use of
saline irrigation or local antibiotics); iii) the heterogeneity of the
criteria used to define success and failure; iv) variability in follow￾up duration and methods. The success rate of ITTC in our
institution is similar to that of other methods of pleural evacuation
in the literature, where success rates ranged from 70% to 94% for
chest tube drainage guided by the imaging [16–23], and from 71%
to 93% for VATS [24–26].
Our criteria for failure were death, and/or therapeutic
escalation, from ITTC to more invasive procedures (i.e. chest
tube drainage or thoracic surgery). The most recent studies [13,14]
defined success as the resolution of CPPE without surgery. With
this criterion, our rate of success would have been 96% in our
series. In comparison with previous studies relating ITTC, the
need for surgery in our study was lower than in Storm et al. [27]
and Wehr et al. [28] series (respectively, 6% and 18%). In
comparison with the MIST studies, the need for surgery in our
study is lower than in MIST1 [13] (16% in the intervention group)
and similar to MIST2 [14] (4%). Overall these data suggest that
surgery can be avoided in most cases of CPPE [29], which may be
preferable given the high prevalence of comorbidities in these
populations [8,30,31].
In our series, the in-hospital mortality was 4%, with a mortality
of 12% at one year. Those results are in accordance with
epidemiologic data [30,32].

Iterative Thoracentesis for Parapneumonic Effusion
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 5 January 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e84788

In our study, two parameters were independently associated
with failure: microorganisms observed on Gram stain of pleural
fluid, and first thoracentesis volume $450 mL. These two items
are available at the beginning of the management and could
therefore be used as a guide for closer monitoring, or earlier switch
to more invasive strategy. Of note, the observation of micro￾organisms after Gram stain on pleural fluid was not affected by
antibiotic use prior to first thoracentesis (p = 0.320), and first
thoracentesis volume was not correlated to imaging findings such
as the estimated size of effusion (p = 0.066), the presence of
mediastinal shift (p = 0.203), loculations (p = 1.000), and was not
affected by ultrasound guidance (p = 0.790). Finally, as observed in
the MIST studies [13,14], fibrinolytic use was not associated with
improved outcome. To our knowledge, only one study analysed
factors associated with ITTC failure [8], and found that an
estimated pleural volume $40% of the thorax was associated with
worse outcome. The factors identified as significantly predictive of
chest tube drainage failure to date are the presence of empyema,
and loculations [12,30].
In our series as in others, ITTC was well tolerated. Pain during
thoracentesis has been reported in 15% to 28% of cases [33–37].
WHO step 3 analgesics were used in 29% of patients in our series,
for less than 24 hours (IQR = 1). Vasovagal reactions have been
reported in 2% to 4% of thoracentesis [36,38], as in our series
(4%). Pneumothorax complicated 4 to 30% of thoracentesis in the
literature, and required chest tube drainage in 20% to 50% of
cases [33–36]. The rate of post-ITTC pneumothorax was 6% in
our series, and never required chest tube drainage. In addition, no
hemothorax was reported despite the use of intrapleural
fibrinolytics in two thirds of cases. These low rates of local
complications may be related to the systematic use of atraumatic
needles, and the large experience accumulated over years, through
the protocolized management of ITTC.
The main limitations of our study are inherent to its design
(retrospective, observational, and monocentric). Failure was
defined as escalation, which was not protocolized, and left to the
physician in charge, based on the combination of clinical,
microbiological, and imaging data. Hence, classification biases
may have occurred (e.g. patients classified as ‘failure’ could have
been successfully controlled with ITTC). This means that our
estimated 81% success rate is conservative. The rate of missing
data did not exceed 10% except for a few variables which were not
included in multivariate analysis.
The main caveats of our strategy based on ITTC are the
following: i) its reliance on experimented staff, which means that
these encouraging results may not be replicated in every
institutions; ii) the significant duration of hospital stay (median,
21 days in our study), although we are currently reducing hospital
stay by earlier discharge, and the development of ambulatory care
units; iii) the need to repeat the procedure (median, three times in
our series), which means that ITTC may be more time-consuming
for physicians, globally, than chest tube drainage.
Our study has several strengths. To our knowledge, this study
included the largest number of patients treated with ITTC
(Table 6).
Our selection criteria enabled the constitution of an homoge￾neous group of patients with CPPE requiring pleural drainage
according to current recommendations [5,6]. Finally, throughout
the study period, standardized protocols for thoracentesis and
pleural fibrinolysis were applied.

Iterative Thoracentesis for Parapneumonic Effusion
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 6 January 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e84788

In conclusion, our study demonstrates that ITTC is safe and
effective as first-line treatment of CPPE. However, the design of
our study (observational, monocentric), precludes comparison of
ITTC with other common therapeutic strategies, such as chest
tube drainage or surgery. The identification of variables available
with the first thoracentesis and independently associated with
failure of the ITTC strategy led us to implement the following
protocol: The first thoracentesis is performed for both diagnostic
and therapeutic purposes. If micro-organisms are observed after
Gram stain on pleural fluid and/or if the volume evacuated during
this first procedure is $450 mL, patients will be closely monitored,
and chest tube drainage or VATS will be considered in case of
uncontrolled sepsis at day 4. In the absence of both failure criteria
(microorganisms observed on Gram stain of pleural fluid, and first
thoracentesis volume $450 mL), ITTC was associated with a
success rate of 97% in our series. A randomized study comparing
ITTC vs. chest tube drainage would be required to establish the
optimal first-line treatment of CPPE.
