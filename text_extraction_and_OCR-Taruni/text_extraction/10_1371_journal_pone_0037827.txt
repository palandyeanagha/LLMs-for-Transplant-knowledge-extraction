Abstract
Background: A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), the rs738409, in the patatin like phospholipase 3 gene (PNPLA3) has
been recently associated with increased hepatic steatosis and ALT levels in adults and children. Given the potential role of
PNPLA3 in fatty liver development, we aimed to explore whether the influence of PNPLA3 genotype on hepatic fat in obese
youth might be modulated by dietary factors such as essential omega polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) intake.
Materials and Methods: We studied 127 children and adolescents (56 boys, 71 girls; 58 Caucasians; 30 African Americans
and 39 Hispanics; mean age 14.763.3; mean BMI 30.767.2). The dietary composition was assessed by the Nutrition Data
System for Research (NDS-R version 2011). The patients underwent a MRI study to assess the liver fat content (HFF%), ALT
measurement and the genotyping of the rs738409 SNP by automatic sequencing.
Results: As previously observed, HFF% and ALT levels varied according to the genotype in each ethnicity. ALT levels and
HFF% were significantly influenced by the interaction between genotype and omega-6/omega-3 PUFA ratio (n-6/n-3),
p = 0.003 and p = 0.002, respectively. HFF% and ALT levels were, in fact, related to the n-6/n-3 consumption only in subjects
homozygote for the G allele of the rs738409 (r2 = 0.45, p = 0.001 and r2 = 0.40, p = 0.006, respectively).
Conclusions: These findings suggest that the association of a high dietary n-6/n-3 PUFA with fatty liver and liver damage in
obese youths may be driven by a predisposing genotype.

Introduction
Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is emerging as one of
the most common complications of childhood obesity. It is
associated with and predicts the metabolic syndrome, independent
of overall obesity [1]. Recently, a non-synonymous SNP
(rs738409), characterized by a C to G substitution encoding an
isoleucine to methionine substitution at the amino acid position
148 in the patatin like phospholipase 3 gene (PNPLA3), was found
to be associated with hepatic steatosis in a multiethnic cohort of
adults [2] as well as in children [3,4]. Moreover, it has been shown
that this variant interacts with environmental stressors, such as
obesity [5,6] and alcohol consumption [7], that induce fatty liver.
Indeed, these stressors seem to uncover the association between
the rs738409 minor allele (G) and hepatic injury in populations in
whom it is otherwise covert [8]. Interestingly, the same process
occurs with some nutrients; the association between the PNPLA3
variant, in fact, seems to be exacerbated by the total carbohydrate
as well as total sugar intake [9].
Recently two studies have started pinpointing the physiologic
role of PNPLA3 and how this is affected by the rs738409 minor
allele [10,11]. In particular, it has been shown that the rs738409
minor allele is associated with a reduced hydrolytic capability of
the protein [10] and that free fatty acids (FFA) potentiate the effect
of PNPLA3 rs738409 variant on intra-hepatic triglycerides
accumulation [11]. This latter observation is of particular interest
if we consider that the amount and the type of FFAs provided by
the diet seem to play a pivotal role in the development of NAFLD
[12]. Recent literature provides clues that the dietary imbalance
between omega-6 (n-6) and omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty
acids (PUFAs) leads to development of an adverse cardiovascular
and metabolic profile and contribute to the pathogenesis of
NAFLD [13]. Biochemical analyses have shown alteration in the
hepatic long chain fatty acid composition toward an increase in
the n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio [14] and animal studies demonstrated
that an excess of n-6 PUFA in the liver is associated with a pro￾inflammatory state [15,16] and an increased lipogenesis leading to
massive fat accumulation into the liver [17–19]. Given these

observations, in the present study we examined whether the
association between the dietary composition in n-6/n-3 PUFA
ratio and MRI measured hepatic fat accumulation might be
influenced by the individual PNPLA3 rs738409 genotype.
Materials and Methods
Subjects
We studied 127 children and adolescents (56 boys, 71 girls;
58 Caucasians; 30 African Americans and 39 Hispanics; mean age
14.763.3; mean BMI 30.7267.23) from the New Haven area
(New Haven, CT) recruited from the Yale Pediatric Obesity
Clinic. Results from an oral glucose tolerance test performed as
previously described [3] revealed that 97 (76%) had a normal
glucose tolerance (NGT), 27 (21%) impaired glucose tolerance
(IGT) and 3 (3%) type 2 diabetes (T2D). The study was approved
by the Yale University Human Investigation Committee. Written
parental informed consent and written child assent were obtained
from all participants. All clinical investigations have been
conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration
of Helsinki.
Genotyping and Liver Function
Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes.
The PNPLA3 rs738409 variant was genotyped by automatic
sequencing as previously reported [3,20]. Liver enzymes were
measured using standard automated kinetic enzymatic assays also
previously reported [3,20].
Dietary Composition
The dietary fat composition was collected and analyzed using
the Nutrition Data System for Research (NDS-R versions 2006
and 2011), a software program developed by the Nutrition
Coordinating Center (NCC), University of Minnesota. Subjects
were instructed by a registered dietitian (RD) on completing a 3-
day food record and advised to record two week days and one
weekend day (since people generally eat differently on the
weekends). No dietary instruction was given to the patients
regarding dietary fat prior to the completion of the food records.
The subjects returned their food records at MRI where dietitian
checked the food records for accuracy, including specific quantity,
product brand name, or cooking method details (NDS-R requires
this multiple-pass method for data input). Final calculations were
completed using NDSR version 2011. The ratio between omega 6
(n-6) and omega 3 (n-3) (n-6/n-3) PUFA was calculated by
dividing the mean n-6 by the mean n-3 PUFAs.
Abdominal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
MRI studies were performed on a GE or Siemens Sonata 1.5
Tesla system [1,3,20]. Measurement of liver fat content was
performed by MRI using the 2-point Dixon (2PD) method as
modified by Fishbein et al [21]. Using the MRIcro software
program, five regions of interest were drawn on each image and
the mean pixel signal intensity level was recorded. The Hepatic
Fat Fraction (HFF %) was calculated in duplicate from the mean
pixel signal intensity data using the formula: [(Sin-Sout)/
(26Sin)]6100. The imaging parameters included: matrix size
= 1286256, flip angle (a) = 30u, TR = 18 ms, TEs = 2.38/
4.76 ms out-of-phase and in-phase, respectively, bandwidth
= 420 Hz/pixel, six averages, slice thickness = 10 mm, one slice,
2.3 seconds/slice (for 2 points), scan time = 14 seconds in a single
breath-hold [22].
Validation of Fast-MRI against 1H-NMR was performed in 34
lean and obese adolescents. A strong correlation was obtained
between the two methods (r = 0.954, p,0.0001) [22]. The within￾subject standard deviation for HFF was 1.9%. Recently, Pacifico
et al reported that MRI measured liver fat content strongly
correlates with macrovesicular steatosis/NASH (r = 0.86,
p = ,.009) in obese kids receiving a liver biopsy for diagnosis
purposes [23].
Statistical Analyses
The chi-square test was used to assess whether the genotypes
were in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium and to test differences in
genotype distribution as well as in gender and categories of glucose
tolerance prevalence. Prior to analyze the data all the variables
were tested for normality, with non-normally distributed variables
log transformed to be better approximated by normality, except
for HFF% for which a square root transformation was used.
Differences in anthropometric features and in dietary intake
among the groups of genotype were tested by ANOVA; age,
gender, z-score BMI and ethnicity were used as covariates when
appropriate.
Since the primary aim of the study was to explore whether the
interaction between the rs738409 variant and n-6/n-3 PUFA
could modulate hepatic fat accumulation in obese children and
adolescents, the primary outcome of the study was the HFF%. In
order to explore whether an eventual interaction may also drive to
liver damage we tested as secondary outcome the ALT levels. ALT
values were not available for 9 subjects (4 CC, 3 CG and 2 GG).
To test the interaction between the genotype and dietary n-6/n-3
PUFA on the HFF% and ALT levels the subjects of the three
ethnic groups were pooled, a regression coefficient (r2
) was used
and the genotype was coded with 0, 1, or 2 corresponding to the
number of minor alleles carried by each individual. An interaction
term between the rs738409 and the dietary intake of n-6/n-3
PUFA was added in a regression model in which age, gender,
ethnicity, z-score BMI and glucose tolerance were used as
covariates. Unless otherwise specified, for all the data raw means
and standard deviations are shown.
Results
The frequency of the minor allele for the rs738409 was 0.26 in
Caucasians, 0.20 in African Americans and 0.49 in Hispanics
(p = 0.01). The allele frequencies were consistent with those shown
in similar ethnic groups in the Allele Frequency Database
(ALFRED, http://alfred.med.yale.edu) as well as in HAPMAP
(http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). Within each ethnic group
there was no evidence against the null hypothesis that the
genotype distribution was in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium for all
of the variants (all p.0.05).
Table 1 shows the clinical features of the study population
according to the genotype in each ethnic group. The three groups
of genotype did not differ in terms of age, gender, z-score BMI and
glucose tolerance in each ethnic group. As previously observed,
HFF% varied among the PNPLA3 rs738409 groups of genotype
(Caucasians p = 0.0006, African Americans p = 0.001, Hispanics
p = 0.09) [3], and there was a trend toward increased ALT levels
in subjects homozygous for the G allele.
In the whole population the mean caloric intake was
2377.76580.9 Kcal, the mean intake of n-3 PUFA was
1.861.1 grams and the mean intake of n-6 PUFA was
14.867.9 grams, the mean dietary n-6/n-3 PUFA was 8.964.2.
There was no difference among the genotypes for the energy
intake (CC 2351.316537.0 Kcal, CG 2393.646553.0 Kcal, GG
24446693.8 Kcal, p = 0.82), n-6 PUFA intake (CC
15.568.7 grams, CG 14.366.5 grams, GG 13.467.9 grams,

p = 0.51) and n- 3 PUFA intake (CC 1.961.3 grams, CG
1.960.8 grams, GG 1.460.7 grams, p = 0.26). The mean dietary
n-6/n-3 PUFA was 9.5665.26 in CC, 7.862.9 in CG and
9.162.3 in GG (p = 0.10).
We observed an interaction between the PNPLA3 gene variant
and the n-6/n-3 PUFA in influencing HFF% (p = 0.002) and ALT
levels (p = 0.003), independently of age, gender, z-score BMI,
ethnicity and glucose tolerance (p = 0.017 and p = 0.016 respec￾tively). This interaction was the result of a different regression
degree between the n-6/n-3 PUFA and HFF% or ALT in the
groups of genotype. In fact, there was a strong association in the
GG group between n-6/n-3 PUFA and ALT or HFF% (r2 = 0.40,
p = 0.006 and r2 = 0.45, p = 0.001 respectively), while the same
association was not present in the other two groups of genotype
(CC and CG) (figure 1 and figure 2).
Discussion
The main result of this study is the observation of an interaction
between the PNPLA3 rs738409 and n-6/n-3 PUFA on hepatic fat
content and ALT levels. This novel finding helps to explain the
strong association between the rs738409 SNP and NAFLD that
has been largely and repeatedly demonstrated [2–8] and raises
new questions about the function of the PNPLA3 itself as well as

about its potential implications in the development of cardiovas￾cular diseases.
Since the association between the PNPLA3 rs738409 and
NAFLD has been discovered [2], several studies have tried to
unravel the pathogenetic mechanism underlying this association. It
has been suggested that this variant may cause a gain of function of
the protein, which would act as a lipogenic factor [24]. In fact,
while knock out mice for the pnpla3 do not show any increased fat
accumulation into the liver with respect to the wild types [25,26],
the administration through viral vectors of the mutated PNPLA3
confers to wild type mice a higher susceptibility to fatty liver [24].
Consistently, it was also shown that SREBP-1c, activated by
carbohydrate feeding, transcriptionally activates pnpla3 as well as
several genes encoding enzymes in the fatty acid biosynthetic
pathway [23]. This mechanism seems also to be indirectly
supported by studies showing an interaction between the
carbohydrates intake and the PNPLA3 rs738409 in determining
the development of fatty liver [9]. The only data that do not fit
with this hypothesis is the lack of association of the PNPLA3
variant with increased plasma triglycerides [2,3].
Our group has previously proposed another mechanistic
hypothesis based on the observation that subjects carrying the G
allele show smaller subcutaneous adipose cells. Since the PNPLA3
has been suggested to be a potential growth factor for adipose cells
[3], we suggested that in these subjects there might be an overflow
of free fatty acids from the adipose tissue to the liver given the
lower capacity of their adipose cells to store the FFA [3]. This
hypothesis was based on a small sample of obese adolescents;
studies in animals knockout for the pnpla3 gene showed that the

PUFA in modulating HFF%. The figure shows a different degree of
regression between HFF% (square root) and n-6/n-3 PUFA (log10) in the
three genotypes. In the CC (Panel A) and CG (Panel B) group there was
no association between HFF% and n-6/n-3 PUFA (r2 = 0.0004, p = 0.86
and r2 = 0.018, p = 0.39, respectively). Only in the GG group (Panel C)
there was a strong association between HFF% and n-6/n-3 PUFA (r2 =
0.45, p = 0.001).

pnpla3 does not contribute significantly to adipose cells develop￾ment [25].
Perhaps more promising are the results provided by studies
focusing on the hydrolytic action of the PNPLA3 given that the
PNPLA3 along with the acylglycerol transacetylase activity also
has a triacylglycerol hydrolase function [10]. By studying this latter
mechanism, it has been recently suggested that the rs738409
variant might cause a lack of the PNPLA3 hydrolytic function
[10]. In particular, the gene variant seems to lower the protein
ability in hydrolyzing the n- 9 of about 15% [10]. The n-9
represents the most common fatty acids in the diet, deriving from
meat, olive oil, sesame oil, almonds, and avocados, but they are
also synthesized starting from essential polyunsaturated fatty acids
such as the n-6 [27]. More recently, another study by Perttila et al
has shown that the presence of a methionine in postion 148 in the
PNPLA3 enhances the cellular accumulation of triglycerides in
presence of an excess FFA by significantly slowing down the
triglycerides hydrolysis [11]. Our observation seems to be
consistent with these animal and in vitro studies [10,11,28]
supporting indirectly the role of PNPLA3 in lipid hydrolysis. In
fact, given those evidences, one could speculate that the overload
of n-6 in the diet will serve both as substrate for new triglycerides
and in the meantime will be slowing down or delaying the
hydrolytic function of the PNPLA3. Thus, in subjects carrying the
rs738409 minor allele, while the newly formed triglycerides will
tend to accumulate into the liver leading to hepatic steatosis, the
excess of n-6 not incorporated into triglycerides will lead to the
over-synthesis of proinflammatory n-6 derived species, which in
turn trigger the second hit responsible for the inflammation that
leads to NASH.
Our observation of an interaction between the PNPLA3
rs738409 variant and the high n-6/n-3 PUFA suggests that we
could provide a targeted therapy to subjects with NAFLD
homozygous for the minor allele either reducing the dietary n-6
amount or alternatively increasing dietary intake of foods rich in n￾3 PUFA, such as salmon, tuna, and flaxseed oil, or supplementing
the diet with n-3 PUFA. The omega 3 supplementation, in fact, by
balancing the n-6/n-3 PUFA has been shown to be effective in
reversing hepatic steatosis in animal as well as in humans [14,29].
In conclusion, our findings show an interaction between the
PNPLA3 rs738409 variant and the dietary n-6/n-3 PUFA in
modulating the hepatic fat accumulation and the liver damage in
obese youths. The study findings generate new questions about the
function of the PNPLA3 itself and pose new opportunity for
targeted therapy in patients with NAFLD.
