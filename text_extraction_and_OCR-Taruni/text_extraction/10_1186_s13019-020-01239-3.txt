Abstract
Background: Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) is an essential device in the field of
emergency and intensive-care medicine. However, long-term use of VA-ECMO has various severe complications,
including thrombosis.
Case presentation: A 60-year-old man underwent his third aortic root replacement using a homograft because of
infectious endocarditis. Although the operation was difficult because of severe adhesion caused by the two
previous interventions, aortic root replacement using a homograft was performed. At the time of withdrawal from
cardiopulmonary bypass, the maintenance of hemodynamics was difficult because of bleeding from the surgical
site, leading to hypovolemic shock. Cardiac function subsequently deteriorated; therefore, VA-ECMO was established
and the operation was finished. Three days later, thrombus was formed inside the homograft and completely
occluded ascending aorta. Evacuation of hematoma was performed, however, cardiac function was not
ameliorated. Eventually, the patient had brain infarction and died. To prevent thrombus formation in very severe
low cardiac output cases under VA-ECMO management after surgery, to prevent the stagnation of the blood flow
from VA-ECMO will be necessary because anticoagulant therapy will be difficult. Impella ventricular assist device
which is recently used widely generates anterograde blood flow and effectively prevents stagnation.
Conclusions: To prevent thrombus formation in cases of very severe low cardiac output, Impella® should be
combinatorially introduced from the beginning of VA-ECMO establishment to prevent thrombosis.

Background
Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
(VA-ECMO) is used to manage circulatory failure, such
as severe heart failure and pulmonary embolism. The
benefit of VA-ECMO is the maintenance of oxygenation
and circulation, which are essential in the field of emer￾gency medicine and intensive-care medicine. Conversely,
long-term VA-ECMO support has various severe com￾plications, such as bleeding, infection, thrombosis, and
related organ infarction (including brain infarction) [1].
In particular, thrombosis subsequently causes thrombo￾embolism, leading to death. The survival rate of cases
with a ventricular thrombus is only 2 out of 12 cases [2].
Therefore, the prevention of thrombus formation is an
important issue in ECMO management.
In this report, we describe a case of complete aortic
obstruction caused by a massive intrahomograft
thrombus during VA-ECMO management and discuss
the steps that can be used to prevent thrombotic
complications.
Case presentation
A 60-year-old man was scheduled to undergo his third
aortic root replacement using a homograft because of in￾fectious endocarditis in the aortic valve. At the age of
58, he underwent Bentall operation, mitral valve replace￾ment, and Maze operation because of aortic regurgita￾tion, mitral regurgitation, and atrial fibrillation. Two
months later, because infection with methicillin-resistant
coagulase-negative staphylococci in the artificial vessel
was indicated, a second aortic root replacement surgery
with coronary artery bypass grafting surgery (CABG)
were performed. This time, because he developed a
slight fever that persisted for about 3 weeks, he visited
our hospital. Infectious endocarditis (IE) in the aortic
valve (Fig. 1a), a false aneurysm in the dorsum of the
artificial vessel (Fig. 1b, c), and mediastinitis (Fig. 1c)
were indicated by echocardiography and computed tom￾ography. As the infection of the artificial vessel was re￾petitive, a third aortic root replacement using a
homograft and CABG were scheduled.
During the hospitalization before the surgery, adminis￾tration of dopamine, dobutamine, and isoproterenol was
started as his circulation dynamics became unstable
because of complete atrioventricular block. The examin￾ation of blood data before the operation is shown in
Supplementary Table 1. On the operation day,
anesthesia was induced with a support of catecholamine,
followed by the establishment of a cardiopulmonary by￾pass (CPB) from the femoral artery and vein before
starting the operation. Although the operation was diffi￾cult and accompanied with bleeding because of severe
adhesion attributed to the two previous operations, aor￾tic root replacement using a homograft and CABG were
performed as planned; two saphenous vein grafts were
connected from the aorta to the left anterior descending
artery and right coronary artery. At the time of with￾drawal from CPB, we had difficulty in maintaining
hemodynamics because of bleeding from the surgical
site, which led to hypovolemic shock. Subsequently, his
cardiac function deteriorated. Therefore, VA-ECMO was
established and the operation was finished.
After the operation, mechanical ventilation and VA￾ECMO support were continued in the intensive-care
unit. The bleeding from the drains continued. His acti￾vated clotting time was in the range of 160 to 180 s
Fig. 1 Preoperative examinations. Echocardiography showed infectious endocarditis (IE) in the aortic valve (a, arrowhead). Computed
tomography revealed a false aneurysm in the dorsum of the artificial vessel (b, c, arrowheads) and the rise of fat tissue in the mediastinum,
indicating mediastinitis (c, arrows)

without the use of heparin. At postoperation day 1
(POD1), echocardiogram demonstrated cardiac hypo￾function, but thrombi were not detected in the right and
left atria and ventricles. Improvement of cardiac func￾tion was not obtained, pulse pressure decreased grad￾ually, and central venous pressure increased gradually.
At POD3, an intrathoracic and pericardial hematoma
was suspected and evacuation of hematoma was per￾formed for cardiac tamponade.
The hematoma in the thoracic cavity and pericardium
was removed by operation. However, cardiac function was
not ameliorated. As the visualization of the ascending
aorta by transesophageal echocardiography was unclear
(Fig. 2a), direct echography in the ascending aorta was
performed by the operator to observe the inside of the
homograft. The homograft was completely occluded by a
thrombus (Fig. 2b, c, d), which was about 4 cm long and
was located at the origin of the ascending aorta; however,
as the surgeon confirmed the bypass graft patent, the en￾tries of the coronary arteries were intact because entries of
the coronary arteries were moved to peripheral side by
CABG operation. The thrombus inside the homograft was
removed (Fig. 2e, f) and the operation was finished.
After the operation, the pulse pressure was slightly im￾proved but cardiac function was not ameliorated. The
patient had brain infarction at POD3 and died at POD5.
Discussion and conclusions
The reported incidences of complications during VA￾ECMO management are 24% of cannulation-related injuries,
20% of bleeding, 11% of left ventricular distention, and 4%
of thromboembolic complication [3]. The reported cases of
thrombosis are mainly ventricular thrombosis, and intra￾aortic thrombosis is extremely rare, with only a few cases re￾ported in the literature [4–7].
In this case, the ascending aorta was completely oc￾cluded by the thrombus. Inflammation after the oper￾ation may be a possible cause of thrombus formation.
Infection as the pathophysiology of the original disease,
IE, may also be associated with this complication. How￾ever, the major contributor to thrombus formation in
this case would be that the movement of the aortic valve
was not observed because of severe low cardiac output.
In the absence of anterograde blood flow from the ven￾tricle, the aortic valve becomes a dead end for the retro￾grade blood flow from VA-ECMO. In general, the blood
flow may be released from the coronary arteries; how￾ever, in this case, the entries of the coronary arteries
were moved to the peripheral side by the CABG oper￾ation. As a result, the ascending aorta became a blind
pouch. The blood flow in the blind pouch stagnated,
leading to thrombus formation. Therefore, chronological
assessment of cardiac function and exploratory assess￾ment of the thrombus not only in the ventricle, but also
in the ascending aorta, are necessary especially in cases
of low cardiac output after CABG operation under VA￾ECMO management.
Takei et al. reported that the fundamental approach to
preventing thrombus formation in the left ventricle is
anticoagulant therapy and prevention of left ventricular
distension. Thus, they suggested that the placement of a left
ventricular assist device (LVAD) at the early stage is an
Fig. 2 Intraoperative findings. The visualization of the ascending aorta by transesophageal echocardiography was unclear (a, arrowheads). Direct
echography in the ascending aorta revealed complete obstruction of the homograft by a thrombus (b, c, d). The thrombus located inside the
homograft was removed (e, f)

effective option in this setting [8]. In the present case, we
hesitated to administer anticoagulant therapy because the
bleeding continued after the operation. LVAD implantation
may be an option to prevent left ventricular distention;
however, LVAD implantation is invasive. Recently, the
Impella ventricular assist device (Impella®; Abiomed,
Danvers, MA) became used widely for the management of
severe low cardiac output cases. Impella® is less invasive as
it can be approached by a catheter, which should facilitate
its selection vs. LVAD. In fact, left ventricular distention
during VA-ECMO management is recognized as a severe
problem, [9] and Impella® is reportedly able to unload the
left ventricle effectively and provide the heart with real rest
[10]. Moreover, the combinatorial use of Impella® with VA￾ECMO has been attempted and its superiority in the
recovery of cardiac function and mortality compared with
VA-ECMO management alone has been recognized [11–
13]. Furthermore, Impella® provides anterograde blood flow
forcibly and prevents stagnation, which may lead to the pre￾vention of thrombus formation [14]. In this case, the com￾binatorial use of Impella® should have been considered at
the same time with VA-ECMO establishment as the car￾diac function was poor, although attention should be paid
to the anticoagulant effect of the purge system.
Conclusively, in cases of very severe low cardiac out￾put under VA-ECMO management, we should pay at￾tention to the formation of thrombi not only in the
cardiac cavity, but also in the ascending aorta. To pre￾vent thrombus formation in these cases, Impella® should
be combinatorially introduced from the beginning of
ECMO establishment as another considerable thera￾peutic option.
