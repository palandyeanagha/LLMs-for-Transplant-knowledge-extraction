Abstract


BACKGROUND: Nosocomial aspergillosis is a well known
complication of immunosuppression in cancer patients and those
undergoing transplantation and has usually been associated with
major building construction or demolition. An observational study
is reported of the hospital environment associated with an outbreak
of aspergillosis in a paediatric oncology ward. METHODS: All cases
of aspergillosis were identified from the hospital records and
categorised as definite or probable according to the extent of
supportive clinical and laboratory findings. All relevant aspects of
building ventilation, air filtration, and aerosol generation
considered relevant were examined and air samples for fungi were
taken in triplicate at 25 sites using a slit sampler with appropriate
culture media. RESULTS: Six cases of aspergillosis were identified
over one year out of the 148 patients who attended the unit - the
only part of the hospital where cases were found. Examination of
the building services and function suggested that the cause or
source was isolated to this paediatric oncology/haematology ward
and may have been attributed to a defective disposal conduit door
as well as the dispersal of a contaminated aerosol from the ward
vacuum cleaner which had the highest measured concentrations of
Aspergillus fumigatus in or around the building (65 colony forming
units (cfu)/m3 compared with 0-6 cfu/m3 elsewhere). No further
cases were identified in the two years after these hygiene
arrangements were changed. CONCLUSIONS: The investigation of
this outbreak of nosocomial aspergillosis identified several possible
sources of fungally contaminated aerosol which could have been
implicated as the cause. Their modification was followed by a
reduction in the incidence of further cases. Each should be
incorporated as an issue of importance in hospital building design
and hygiene.
