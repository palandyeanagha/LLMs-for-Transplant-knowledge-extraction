Abstract
Background: The Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) 2010 Clinical Practice Guidelines for the management of
cryptococcosis outlined three key populations at risk of disease: (1) HIV-infected, (2) transplant recipient, and (3) HIV￾negative/non-transplant. However, direct comparisons of management, severity and outcomes of these groups have not
been conducted.
Methodology/Principal Findings: Annual changes in frequency of cryptococcosis diagnoses, cryptococcosis-attributable
mortality and mortality were captured. Differences examined between severe and non-severe disease within the context of
the three groups included: demographics, symptoms, microbiology, clinical management and treatment. An average of
nearly 15 patients per year presented at Duke University Medical Center (DUMC) with cryptococcosis. Out of 207 study
patients, 86 (42%) were HIV-positive, 42 (20%) were transplant recipients, and 79 (38%) were HIV-negative/non-transplant.
HIV-infected individuals had profound CD4 lymphocytopenia and a majority had elevated intracranial pressure. Transplant
recipients commonly (38%) had renal dysfunction. Nearly one-quarter (24%) had their immunosuppressive regimens
stopped or changed. The HIV-negative/non-transplant population reported longer duration of symptoms than HIV-positive
or transplant recipients and 28% (22/79) had liver insufficiency or underlying hematological malignancies. HIV-positive and
HIV-negative/non-transplant patients accounted for 89% of severe disease cryptococcosis-attributable deaths and 86% of
all-cause mortality.
Conclusions/Significance: In this single-center study, the frequency of cryptococcosis did not change in the last two
decades, although the underlying case mix shifted (fewer HIV-positive cases, stable transplant cases, more cases with
neither). Cryptococcosis had a relatively uniform and informed treatment strategy, but disease-attributable mortality was
still common.

Introduction
Cryptococcus neoformans is an invasive mycoses that can cause
meningoencephalitis, particularly among those who are immuno￾compromised, but in some cases it can infect immunocompetent
individuals [1]. The 2010 IDSA Cryptococcal Guidelines defined
three distinct risk groups for induction treatment of cryptococcosis
[2]: (1) HIV-positive; (2) transplant recipients; and (3) a
heterogeneous group with neither of these conditions (i.e., HIV￾negative/non-transplant). A major component of this review was
to describe outcomes of recent management of these three groups.
During this study, four important factors were in play that justified
our decision to use the broad 14-year study period in order to
maximize cohort size. First, HAART became readily prescribed in
1996 with supportive evidence of the superiority of combination
antiretroviral therapy over monotherapy in reducing AIDS
morbidity and mortality [3]. Second, lipid products of amphoter￾icin B, for patients with renal impairment or unacceptable toxicity
that prevent the use of conventional amphotericin B, were in use
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 August 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 8 | e43582

since their initial FDA approval in November, 1995 [4]. Third, in
2000 the original IDSA Guidelines were published as a standard of
treatment [5]. Fourth, there was an active Infectious Disease group
at our institution with a particular interest in the pathogenesis and
treatment of cryptococcosis.
The three risk groups defined by the IDSA and corresponding
depths of information supporting treatment guidelines have been
shaped through their individual patterns of emergence over time.
In the last two decades, HIV-positive populations with cryptococ￾cosis have been the most widely studied group
[6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18] and have received greater
attention recently due to the recognition that cryptococcosis
incidence in this group remains high, particularly in the AIDS￾infected population in sub-Saharan Africa [19]. Starting in the
1960–1980’s, use of immunosuppressive medications to treat
severe diseases or for solid organ transplantation has increased the
pool of patients susceptible to Cryptococcus. In the late 1990’s,
Cryptococcus gattii emerged in Vancouver Island, British Columbia,
resulting in an outbreak of infections in both immunosuppressed
and immunocompetent hosts [20,21]. The HIV-negative crypto￾coccosis patient group had been excluded from clinical review for
several decades but has gained more attention recently
[22,23,24,25,26,27]. Cryptococcal patients who are HIV-negative,
particularly those who have few or no underlying risk factors (i.e.,
‘‘apparently immunocompetent’’), may experience more of a delay
in time to presentation and diagnosis than HIV-positive or
transplant recipient patients [26]. In particular, recent evidence
has shown that HIV-negative, non-immunosuppressed cryptococ￾cal meningitis patients suffered higher mortality rates than HIV￾positive patients [25].
Due to its rare occurrence, prospective observational studies of
this disease are logistically problematic. Interventional approaches
have historically been based on expert opinion and retrospective
cohort studies more than a decade old, with few representing HIV￾negative populations and comparatively developed countries
[26,28,29,30]. In this relatively large, retrospective single-center
study, our goal was to provide an in-depth look at how
cryptococcosis was managed clinically in the HIV-positive,
transplant recipient and HIV-negative/non-transplant patient
groups in order to improve our understanding of this disease.
Methods
Objectives
The goals of this study were to describe trends in cryptococcosis
symptoms, diagnosis, treatment and mortality through a 14-year
study period (1996–2009) within the context of the three groups
defined by the IDSA Guidelines.
Participants
We identified all consecutive adult patients ($18 years old)
discharged from DUMC with International Classification of
Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9) diagnosis codes of cryptococcosis
(117.5), and cryptococcal meningitis (321.0) between January 1,
1996 and October 31, 2009 through electronic medical records.
Eligible subjects had confirmed cryptococcal disease and a
sufficient medical record (electronic and/or paper chart) available
for review. A cryptococcosis case was confirmed by having $1 of
the following: positive cerebral-spinal fluid (CSF) cryptococcal
antigen (CRAG) or fungal culture, direct histological examination
of tissue or fluid with characteristic yeast forms of Cryptococcus,
positive serum cryptococcal antigen test with a consistent disease
process or positive culture from blood or pulmonary sites.
Description of Investigations
Demographics, presenting symptoms (including duration), and
underlying conditions at the time of diagnosis were collected.
Clinical differences examined included: presentation and dura￾tion of symptoms, microbiological evidence of cryptococcal
disease, and initial antifungal treatment. Clinical isolates were
not typed in this study. C. gattii is rare in the Southeastern U.S.
with only one identified clinical case in an immunocompromised
adult [31]. Serotype A (C. neoformans var. grubii) predominates
the region of our study [32]. Follow-up visit information
relevant to cryptococcosis (laboratory testing, clinic visits, and
readmission) was also captured. Patients were followed from the
date of diagnosis and/or admission until loss-to-follow-up,
death, or until the end of the study period. In order to assess
one-year mortality prevalence for all patients, we obtained data
on survival and mortality up to one year after their date of
cryptococcosis diagnosis from the Duke Data Support Repos￾itory (DSR), which uses the Social Security Administration
death index, the Tumor Registry and The Duke Information
System for Cardiovascular Care death data to report mortality
status. Investigators recorded all information on a standardized
abstraction form developed in collaboration with epidemiologists
and clinicians.
We report on annual changes in frequency of cryptococcosis
diagnoses, treatment, and outcomes including: overall mortality
through one year, deaths attributable to cryptococcosis, and
occurrence of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome
(IRIS). Defined and determined by a panel of experts at DUMC,
death was attributable if patients experienced conditions directly
related to cryptococcal disease, such as: increased central nervous
system (CNS) pressure, persistence or relapse of infection, while
receiving initial induction treatment or due to organ failure during
treatment for cryptococcosis. The criteria used to identify IRIS,
adapted from Singh and Perfect (2007), included clinical or
radiographic manifestations consistent with an inflammatory
process, such as contrast enhancing lesions on imaging studies
(CT/MRI), combined with symptoms that occurred during receipt
of appropriate therapy and could not be explained by newly
acquired infection, and at least one of the following: (1) negative
results for cultures or stable/reduced biomarkers for the initial
fungal pathogen during diagnostic work-up for the inflammatory
process, (2) CSF pleocytosis .5 WBC/mm3, (3) Increased ICP, (4)
histopathology showing granulomatous lesions, or (5) unexplained
hypercalcemia [33].
Central nervous system (CNS), pulmonary and ‘other’ crypto￾coccosis patients were collapsed into two categories based on
specific indicators described in the 2010 IDSA Treatment
Guidelines [2]: severe disease (evidence of CNS involvement, or
cryptococcemia or dissemination with evidence of high fungal
burden based on serum CRAG $1:512) or non-severe disease.
Ethics
This study was approved by both the Duke University Medical
Institutional Review Board (IRB) and the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill Biomedical IRB. Both named IRBs
waived the need for informed consent for this study. This research
met criteria for a waiver of informed consent according to Title 45,
Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 46.116(d).
Statistical Methods
All data was entered into Microsoft Office Access (2007) and
analyses were performed using SAS v9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary,
NC). Variables were examined using descriptive statistics and
stratified based on the three groups and/or severity of

cryptococcosis as needed. Where appropriate, the Student’s t￾test was used to test the difference of two means and the
Kruskal-Wallis test was used for the difference between medians
for non-parametric continuous data. Chi-square (X2
) tests were
used to examine differences between categorical frequency
distributions. The statistical significance level of alpha (a) equal
to 0.05 was used for each two-tailed test performed, thus a
‘‘significant’’ result refers to a p-value ,0.05.
Results
There were 223 study patients identified; 16 were excluded due
to the following reasons: unable to locate chart (n = 1), transferred
out of care prior to diagnostic test results and did not receive
treatment at DUMC (n = 4), patient ,18 years (n = 1), and the
patient did not have verified cryptococcal disease (n = 10). A total
of 207 patients were used for analysis. The majority of cases were
CNS disease (61%), followed by pulmonary (34%) and other sites
(Table 1). Consistent across the three clinical groups, nearly two￾thirds of the cohort were male (65%) and African Americans were
more prevalent among HIV-positive patients than the other two
groups (Table 1). HIV-positive patients were significantly younger
than the other two groups.
Overall annual case frequencies of cryptococcosis did not
significantly change over time (Figure 1). During the study period,
the number of transplant patients per year averaged three (range,
0–5 cases/yr.).The frequency of HIV-infected cases averaged six
annually (range, 2–12 cases/yr.). Among HIV-negative, non￾transplant cases there was a slight increasing trend with time; the
annual average number of cases was six (range, 3–9 cases/yr.).
Although the total cases have remained relatively steady (,15/
yr.), there appeared to be a shift to a decreasing proportion of
HIV-positive patients with a concomitant increase in HIV￾negative cases. HIV-positive patients accounted for half of all
cases in the first seven years of this study then fell to less than one￾third in the latter seven years.
Within-group Observations
Within the HIV-positive patient group (n = 86), 74 (86%) had
CNS disease, 9 (11%) had pulmonary cryptococcosis and three
patients had another form of cryptococcosis (Table 1). Twenty￾seven (31%) patients were newly identified as positive for HIV
infection during their hospital admission for cryptococcosis. CD4
counts were available for 62 (72%) patients during hospitalization
(median, 22 cells/mL; range: 1–300 cells/mL). Forty-two percent of
HIV-positive patients with severe (n = 31) and non-severe (n = 5)
cryptococcosis reported current or previous exposure to HAART
therapy, but management compliance was heterogeneous. Prev￾alence of reported HAART exposure did not differ significantly
comparing earlier (1996–2002) and later cases (2003–2009).
During admission 18 patients (21%) continued their known
HAART therapy, four patients (5%) changed to another regimen,
six patients (7%) continued their current therapy but changed their
regimen at the time of discharge and six patients had their therapy
held on admission. Seventeen patients (20%) had no confirmed
previous exposure to HAART; eight died with cryptococcal
disease-related deaths. Thirty-five patients (41%) were started
newly on HAART therapy at the time of or after discharge. The
median time-to-start of HAART therapy was 67 days after the
start of induction therapy.
Among transplant recipients (n = 42), 18 (43%) had CNS disease
(severe) and 24 (57%) had pulmonary disease (non-severe; Table 1).
The majority of transplants were renal (n = 17; 4 included
pancreas) followed by cardiac (n = 11) and pulmonary (n = 9).
The median time from transplant to diagnosis of cryptococcosis
(n = 41) was 26 months (Inter-Quartile Range [IQR]: 10–56
months). Over one-third (n = 16) of transplant recipients had renal
insufficiency at the time of diagnosis (Table 2), but only two
patients (11%) with severe disease experienced a .50% decrease
in Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) during induction treatment.
Current steroid exposure at the time of cryptococcosis was high
(93%), and 19 patients (24%) had their immunosuppressive
therapy stopped or changed at the time of their cryptococcosis
diagnosis. Of the 39 patients taking steroids prior to cryptococcosis

diagnosis, 37 (95%) had dose information. The median daily dose
was 10 mg of prednisone or prednisone equivalent (range: 4–
30 mg/day). Most of these patients had been on extended
immunosuppressive therapy. The median duration of immuno￾suppression (n = 39) was 19 months (IQR: 8–56 months).
In the HIV-negative/non-transplant group (n = 79), 34 (43%)
had CNS disease, 38 (48%) had pulmonary cryptococcosis and 7
(9%) had another form of cryptococcosis (Table 1). There were 37
(47%) patients with no underlying malignancy or immunosup￾pressive therapy at the time of diagnosis. Ninety percent of all
cancers in the cohort were among HIV-negative, non-transplant
patients (Table 2). Of the 31 patients (39%) taking steroids prior to
cryptococcosis diagnosis, 24 (77%) had dose information. The
median daily dose was 20 mg prednisone or prednisone equivalent
(range: 5–267 mg/day). The median duration of any type of
immunosuppressive therapy (N = 21) was 7 months (IQR: 1–36
months). Eight patients (21%) with severe disease experienced a
.50% decrease in GFR during induction treatment.
Clinical Symptoms
There were 21 patients (10%) who were asymptomatic at the
time of diagnosis (Table 2). Of the 19 with asymptomatic
pulmonary disease, 10 were transplant recipients and nine were
HIV-negative/non-transplant patients.
Among the patients reporting symptoms (n = 186), the duration
of symptoms was unknown for 30 patients; 10 (12%) patients
among those with HIV, seven (22%) of transplant recipients and
13 (18%) of the patients in the third group. Excluding these
patients, the mean length of symptoms prior to presentation was
not significantly different between severe and non-severe disease.
The mean symptom duration was longer for the HIV-negative/
non-transplant patients than either of the other two groups

(Table 3). When compared to this group, the difference in means
was 225 days (95% Confidence Limits [CL] 250, 1) for the HIV￾positive patients and 220 days (95% CL 248, 8) for transplant
recipients with severe disease. The differences in means were even
greater when comparing the groups with non-severe disease
(Table 3).
Patients with severe disease frequently experienced headaches,
altered mental status, fevers, nausea and vomiting across all three
groups at initial presentation (Table 2). The prevalence of nausea
and vomiting was significant between groups with them being
more common in HIV and transplant recipients. Furthermore,
headache was significantly more prevalent among HIV-positive
patients (73%) and similar between the other two groups.
Symptoms among non-severe cryptococcosis patients were similar
between transplant recipients and HIV-negative/non-transplant
groups. However, the prevalence of corticosteroid exposure was
significantly higher in transplant recipients (Table 2).
Patient Diagnostics
Among patients with severe disease, patients had similar lumbar
puncture (LP) results among all three groups (Table 4). At least one
opening pressure (OP) measurement was available for 79 (63%)
patients. Peak OP distributions were very similar between all three
groups with a mean of 33 cm H2O (SD616 cm H2O). The
proportion of HIV-positive patients (48%) with elevated CSF host
cells ($20 cells/mm3
) was significantly less than the other groups,
which had frequencies of 78% and 61% (Table 4). The difference
in frequencies across all three patient groups having an elevated

CSF CRAG titer ($1:1024) and positive India ink neared
significance. With regard to the frequency of these two CSF
diagnostic measures, further comparison of non-HIV/non-trans￾plant with the other two groups combined (differences in
frequencies between HIV-positive and transplant patients were
not significant) indeed reached the level of significance. CSF
glucose and protein levels were similar in all groups (,40% of all
patients had hypoglycorrhachia). There was no significant
difference between groups in regards to cryptococcemia (Table 4).
Among non-severe disease patients, histological evidence of
Cryptococcus was identified in over 60% of the two HIV-negative
groups (Table 4). Positive pulmonary cultures were identified by at
least one positive culture, biopsy or broncho-alveolar lavage in
.50% of HIV-negative patients, whereas only 17% (n = 2) of
HIV-positive patients had documentation of pulmonary disease.
Of the 40 HIV-negative/non-transplant patients, 22 (55%)
received an LP to rule out CNS disease, which was not significant
compared to the 18 (75%) transplant recipients but was significant
compared to the 11 (92%) HIV-positive patients who received an

LP when non-severe disease was identified.
Initial Treatment
During the study period, 132 patients (64%) received ampho￾tericin B (either formulation) for initial induction therapy.
Utilization of amphotericin B deoxycholate (AmpBd) decreased
over time, indicating that lipid formulation amphotericin B
(LFAmpB) was used more frequently as initial therapy in recent
years (Figure 2). Despite this observed trend, AmpBd was used as
initial induction therapy for 80% of patients across the entire study
period.
Induction antifungal regimens are summarized in Table 5.
Eighty percent of patients with non-severe disease were given
fluconazole for initial treatment; this was not significantly different
across the three risk groups. In the severe disease group, the
frequency of polyene use as initial therapy was high for all three
patient groups (89% of HIV-positive, 100% of transplant, and
87% of HIV-negative/non-transplant), as was the use of flucyto￾sine in combination with the polyene (78% of HIV-positive, 83%
of transplant, and 72% of HIV-negative/non-transplant).
Mortality and IRIS
Mortality attributable to cryptococcosis was 15% (n = 31) and
there was a total of 52 deaths (25%) through one year of follow-up
(Table 5). HIV-positive and HIV-negative/non-transplant patients
accounted for 89% of severe disease cryptococcosis-attributable
deaths and these two groups accounted for 86% of all-cause
mortality. IRIS was identified in seven (3%) cases and most of
these cases had severe cryptococcosis. Four out of the seven
patients were HIV-positive but IRIS was observed in the other two
groups.
The HIV-negative/non-transplant group experienced both
greater mortality attributable to cryptococcosis and overall
mortality, since they accounted for nearly half of all cryptococ￾cosis-attributable deaths (15/31) and more than half of all-cause
mortality (29/52). Within this group, patients who died were older
at diagnosis (mean, 63 years) than those who did not (mean, 51
years). However, the average age at diagnosis was not significantly
different between survivors and those who died within either the
HIV-positive or transplant groups.
Discussion
The 2010 IDSA Guidelines divided cryptococcal disease into
three risk groups because of their different management issues in
an attempt to better describe the issues around treatment and
outcome [2]. The results from our study found notable trends and
important clinical differences between and within these groups and
uniquely describes the realities in the management of this disease
at one institution.
In the early parts of the 14-year study period, the highest
number of cases occurred in the HIV-infected population, which
appeared to experience fewer of cryptococcal infections in recent
years, coinciding with the widespread use of HAART. However,
42% of HIV-positive patients in this cohort had been exposed to
HAART, emphasizing that despite therapies to control HIV
infection, cryptococcosis will continue to be an opportunistic
infection in HIV-infected persons. The HIV-negative/non-trans￾plant patients appeared to offset the reduction of cryptococcosis
seen in HIV-infected patients in more recent years. As we continue
to aggressively treat serious underlying diseases with immunosup￾pressants and the denominator of persons-at-risk enlarges, this
group will likely increase since there is no strategy for prophylaxis.
There was a consistent number of cases of cryptococcosis in the
transplant recipients over time despite the widespread use of the
potentially anti-cryptococcal agents, the calcineurin inhibitors
[34,35,36,37,38]. The steady annual prevalence of cryptococcosis
in this group supports the continued routine use of immunosup￾Figure 2. Use of amphotericin B. Amphotericin B formulation trends over time. Annual percentage of patients receiving lipid formulation

pressants and thus a persistent need for careful diagnostic
surveillance for detection of early cryptococcosis [39].
The differences within the groups were several. For HIV￾infected individuals, there was a variety of antiretroviral strategies
employed during anti-cryptococcal therapy that reflects the lack of
precise guidelines on when to initiate HAART [40]. Similar to
previous studies, most of these patients had profound CD4
lymphocytopenia and a majority of these patients (76%) had
elevated intracranial pressure [16,17,41,42]. The important
underlying issues surrounding transplant recipients were immu￾nosuppressive drugs and frequent renal dysfunction. All had some
form of immunosuppression but only one-quarter had their
immunosuppressive regimens stopped or changed and the
prevalence of IRIS was low. Also, one-third of patients started
treatment with evidence of renal dysfunction, emphasizing that
lipid products of amphotericin B may be essential therapeutic
choices in this group and that monitoring flucytosine levels and/or
complete blood counts may be necessary to prevent treatment
toxicity during worsening of renal dysfunction caused by polyene
treatment [43]. Moreover, the average time from transplant to
cryptococcal infection was within range of the 17–28 months
reported in previous studies [37,43,44,45,46]. There were two
important findings in the HIV-negative/non-transplant group.
First, the duration of symptoms in this group with severe disease
averaged 44 days prior to diagnosis and although not reaching
significance from the other groups (it was significant among those
with non-severe disease), this notable delay deserves greater
attention and has been observed in a previous case series [23].
This delay may have contributed to the observed poorer outcome
of the group. Another study also found a lack of significance
between HIV-infected, immunocompromised, and immunocom￾petent groups, where the symptom duration averaged approxi￾mately 15 days [25]. It is possible that the other two groups have
specialists aware of the risk of cryptococcosis, while in this group
diagnosis is delayed because cryptococcosis is not considered.
Second, 33% had liver insufficiency or hematological malignan￾cies. These are important findings as this subgroup had the highest
mortality and both factors have been shown to be predictors of
mortality in HIV-negative cryptococcosis patients [24,47]. Previ￾ous results emphasize that disseminated cryptococcosis among
HIV-negative patients experienced the worst prognosis secondary
to the stage of underlying disease and the immunosuppressive
medication used [26,34]. It has been clearly shown in the HIV￾positive population with cryptococcal disease that stage of HIV is
strongly associated with poor outcome [48]. The underlying
disease and its stage are major factors in cryptococcosis outcome.
Since delay in diagnosis may be a prognostic factor, we
investigated whether there were additional differences in symp￾toms and laboratory findings between the three groups. There
were few differences between HIV-infected patients and transplant
recipients who generally had similar symptoms and CSF
laboratory parameters. However, headaches (known to be a
prognostic factor) [29], were similar between both HIV-negative
groups and significantly more prevalent in the HIV-positive group.
While all three groups had a high prevalence of poor prognostic
signs such as altered mental status (,1/3), the presence of nausea
and vomiting were less common in the HIV-negative/non￾transplant group with severe disease. These findings differ from
another study that reported significantly more mental status
changes in non-immunosuppressed patients compared to HIV￾positive patients [25]. Additionally, our study supports previous
evidence that suggests non-immunosuppressed patients have less
fungemia [24]. The HIV-negative/non-transplant group also
appeared to present with a smaller burden of yeasts by India ink
and CRAG test results than the other two groups. Although
appreciation for burden of organisms and outcome could not be
precisely understood in this retrospective review, prospective
studies of cryptococcal meningitis may benefit from quantification
of viable yeasts in the CSF (Colony-forming unit [CFU]/mL
measurements) and understanding its rate of change during

therapy in relationship to treatment strategy and outcome
[12,49,50].
Importantly, compared to HIV-positive and transplant recipi￾ents, the attributable mortality in the HIV-negative/non-trans￾plant population with severe disease was nearly two-times higher
despite the fact that the majority of patients received induction
therapy with a polyene and flucytosine. A recent multi-center
study of 86 cryptococcal meningitis patients also found the highest
mortality in the non-immunosuppressed group (46%) compared to
immunosuppressed (19%) and HIV-positive (15%) cryptococcal
meningitis patients [25], and previous studies have reported 30 -
44% overall mortality in the HIV-negative population
[22,23,24,26]. In one of these studies this rate was compared to
a 22% mortality among HIV-positive patients [24]. However, a
couple of these studies included some C. gatii cases so that species’
factors may have influenced outcome [22,24]. Clearly more
studies to inform the management of the HIV-negative/non￾transplant group and to understand how host immunity and yeast
strain may play a role in poorer prognosis are needed so as to
reduce this elevated mortality.
One of the major complications of cryptococcosis management
has been the identification and management of IRIS. We
identified the occurrence of IRIS in all three groups but the
prevalence (3%) was relatively low compared to other studies
which primarily included AIDS patients (range, 8–19%)
[51,52,53,54]. This frequency could be influenced by our
definition of IRIS, the patient mix, and/or clinical management.
In general, our HAART management was delayed (.60 days after
start of induction therapy) and only approximately a quarter of the
transplant recipients had their immunosuppressants adjusted. This
lack of immune manipulation during early induction therapy may
influence our lower rate of IRIS. However, it is identified in a
measureable amount of all patient groups and needs to be
appreciated by clinicians.
Lipid formulations of amphotericin B outside of HIV-infected
patients have limited critical appraisal of proper dosing and
efficacy [55,56]. However, as Figure 2 demonstrated, there is a
general increase in the use of lipid formulations for induction
therapy at our institution. We expect this was in relationship to the
approximately third of patients who develop nephrotoxicity during
management. Therefore, further investigation into lipid products
of amphotericin B is still warranted to ensure their optimal use.
Limitations
This review was limited to a single tertiary care center and
teaching hospital. Our medical center averaged nearly 15 cases of
cryptococcosis per year and this likely reflects both an endemic
exposure to this yeast in the environment within the Southeastern
USA and an enriched population of immunosuppressed individ￾uals due to our hospital’s care patterns. The actual number of
cases seen in a particular medical center certainly varies within the
U.S. Furthermore, using hospital records favors cases with severe
disease and could result in selection bias against asymptomatic
disease. Determining the total population-at-risk was not estimable
in this study and the underlying source population and referral
patterns could shift over time. Retrospective chart review has the
potential for incomplete or incorrect information capture due to
loss of paper documentation or lack of entry in electronic medical
record. We used both sources to ensure data was as complete as
possible and discrepancies were minimized. Erroneous self-report
of symptoms or symptom duration was a possibility, but this is a
limitation of many observational clinical studies. Despite our
careful abstraction process, missing or incomplete data could lead
to bias in categorization of symptoms or derived outcome
definitions, such as IRIS. Being a rare disease, limited numbers
of cases prevented robust statistical analyses, although this study is
one of the largest to date. Importantly, much of the clinical
attention over the last two decades has centered around two
groups (HIV-infected and transplant recipients). There has been
less focus on treatment of HIV-negative/non-transplant patients
and yet this group suffered the highest mortality.
Conclusions
In summary, dividing patients with cryptococcosis into three
risk groups showed both differences and similarities within the
groups. In a single medical center the overall frequency of
cryptococcosis has not changed though the composition of the
three groups has changed in the last two decades. Despite three
major classes of drugs to treat severe disease and a relatively
uniform and informed treatment strategy framed by the IDSA
Guidelines, attributable mortality was common. Prospective multi￾center studies and comparison of strategies in advanced medical
centers are still needed to determine the extent high mortality
revolved around underlying disease, high burden of organisms and
delayed diagnosis.
