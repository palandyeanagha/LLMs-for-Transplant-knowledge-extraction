SUMMARY: Infections due to Prototheca spp. are ubiquitous in nature, occurring in both im￾munocompetent and immunocompromised patients. The study cohort consisted of 14 cases of
Prototheca algaemia reported over the past 5 decades and 2 recent cases from study hospitals. Protothe￾ca wickerhamii was the most common species. The overall mortality rate was 62.5z. Prototheca algae￾mia, a healthcare-associated infection, was observed in immunocompromised patients and was associ￾ated with a poor prognosis.
Prototheca, an achlorophyllous alga that is ubiqui￾tous in the natural environment, has been found to
colonize in the fingernails, skin, respiratory tract, and
digestive system of humans (1–4). In the genus Pro￾totheca, P. wickerhamii, P. zopfii, and P. cutis sp. nov.
are potential human pathogens, with P. wickerhamii
playing the predominant role (5–10). The first reported
case of algaemia was published by Cox et al. in 1974
(11). Till date, more than 100 cases of human protothe￾cosis have been reported, with a predominance of
cutaneous involvement (9). Local or systemic steroid
use, hematological malignant disease, diabetes mellitus,
AIDS, and organ transplantation have been considered
to be the main risk factors. However, Prototheca algae￾mia has rarely been reported. Here, we summarize the
clinical features, antimicrobial therapy, and outcome of
16 cases of Prototheca algaemia.
To identify the reported cases, we searched the
PubMed database using key words, including
``Prototheca,'' ``protothecosis,'' and ``algaemia'' and
found 14 cases reported to have Prototheca algaemia.
We also included 2 cases of algaemia from 2 hospitals in
southern Taiwan. Under ethical review of the Institu￾tional Review Board in Chi Mei Medical Center, the
committee concluded that the review of a case report is
not necessary (application number: 10206-E01).
A 57-year-old man (Case 15) who presented with
severe numbness in his lower left leg for 1 day. He had
type 2 diabetes mellitus and secondary hypothyroidism
due to a prior I-131 therapy for hyperthyroidism. Later,
Cushing syndrome due to ectopic adrenocorticotropic
hormone (ACTH) syndrome was diagnosed from
laboratory data and imaging results. During hospitaliza￾tion, a small wound (8 × 8 mm) was observed on his
left index finger due to repeated pinpricks for blood su￾gar measurement. A local incision was made, and pus
culture was performed on day 24 after admission. Six
days later, he developed respiratory failure, requiring
ventilator support. Empirical broad-spectrum antibiot￾ics were prescribed. On day 33, the pus culture was posi￾tive for P. wickerhamii. Despite amphotericin B ther￾apy, he died on day 40. Three days later, blood cultures
were positive for P. wickerhamii.
A 75-year-old woman (Case 16) with type 2 diabetes
mellitus and hypertension presented to the emergency
department because of accidental ingestion of a deter￾gent-containing acid. Emergent transhiatal esopha￾gectomy, total gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y jejunoduo￾denostomy, and jejunojejunostomy were performed.
Empirical parenteral flomoxef and fluconazole were
prescribed. On day 9 after admission, she went into
shock, and blood cultures were obtained. Due to evolv￾ing multiple organ failure, she died on day 16. Later,
blood cultures were positive for P. wickerhamii.
Retrospective analysis of 16 published cases, includ￾ing the 2 aforementioned cases, was conducted (Table
1). Steroid therapy was prescribed upon diagnosis of
protothecosis in 6 cases. P. wickerhamii was the
predominant pathogen (13 cases). Amphotericin-B ther￾apy was used in 11 cases, 5 (45.5z) of which died;
however, when antifungal therapies other than am￾photericin B were used or no antifungal therapy was
used, all 5 cases died (P ＝ 0.09, Fisher's exact test).
Therefore, a total of 10 cases died of algaemia, leading
to a mortality rate of 62.5z.
Nine (56z) cases exhibited various skin lesions.
Among these, Prototheca spp. were isolated wounds or

pus in 5 cases (11–15) from 1 of our cases (Case 15).
Central venous catheters (CVCs) were present in 11
cases, and none showed evidence of catheter-related in￾fections. No evidence of ventilator-associated Protothe￾ca infections was found in the 5 cases with ventilator
support. Among 10 cases with detailed hospital infor￾mation, the onset of algaemia after admission ranged
from 9 to 63 days, except for 1 case (Case 14). Preceding
Enterococcus (8,15,16) or Escherichia coli (15,17) bac￾teremia, and Candida glabrata fungemia (12,18,19)
were commonly observed. In addition, 3 cases ex￾perienced cytomegalovirus viremia (16,19,21).
To identify the possible sources of infection, we ob￾served various skin lesions in 9 cases. Although no
specific skin lesion could be identified as a predictor of
algaemia, Prototheca spp. were isolated from the skin
lesions of 6 cases. Thus, the skin was the potential por￾tal of entry; however, the primary focus remained ob￾scure in majority of the cases. Microbial translocation
from the intestine is another possibility, just as candide￾mia, and the skin lesions may be secondary features.
Concurrent or recent steroid use was observed in 6
cases (37.5z). Among the 6 cases of algaemia with
preceding cutaneous protothecosis, 3 had prior steroid
use or ectopic ACTH syndrome. Accordingly, steroid
use or ectopic ACTH syndrome could be an important
factor in precipitating cutaneous Prototheca infection
to algaemia.
Among 10 cases with detailed hospital information, 9
were regarded as healthcare-associated infections. CVC
tip cultures were performed in 3 cases (12,16,22) and 1
of our cases (Case 15), and all were negative for Pro￾totheca spp. Thus, the possibility of catheter-related al￾gaemia was low. Despite the fact that Prototheca spp.
have been found to colonize the respiratory tract (6), no
protothecal organisms were isolated from sputum sam￾ples. Thus, no conclusion could be made regarding the
sources or reservoirs of Prototheca spp. in the cases of
healthcare-associated algaemia.
Among the 16 cases of algaemia, the mortality rate of
those treated with amphotericin B was lower than that
of the cases without amphotericin B therapy, although
the statistical difference was not significant. None of the
cases solely treated with an azole (2 cases) or echinocan￾din (1 case) survived. Therefore, amphotericin B may
play a crucial therapeutic role for Prototheca algaemia.
Concurrent or preceding bacterial, fungal, or viral
infections and prior exposure to multiple antimicrobial
agents were common. Given the limited number of
cases, no specific pathogen or antimicrobial agent could
be identified as being related to Prototheca algaemia.
In conclusion, Prototheca algaemia often occurs in
immunocompromised individuals and can be inferred to
be a healthcare-associated infection. The skin is a possi￾ble portal of entry for Prototheca spp., although the
possibility of other routes cannot be ignored. If pro￾tothecosis is suspected, amphotericin B should be
promptly administered to achieve a favorable outcome.
