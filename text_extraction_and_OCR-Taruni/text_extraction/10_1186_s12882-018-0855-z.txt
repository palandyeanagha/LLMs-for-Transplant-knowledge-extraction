Abstract
Background: Membranous nephropathy (MN), the leading cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults, is characterized
by the deposition of subepithelial immune deposits. Most of the cases are primary, while only approximately 25%
of the cases are secondary to some known diseases. Recently, MN has been considered to be a possible
presentation of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of the kidney in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation (HSCT) patients. In autologous HSCT populations, there have been scarce reports of associated MN,
as a result of immune dysregulation leading to systemic autoimmunity and miming chronic GVHD.
Case presentation: We report an exceptional case of MN associated to an acute renal failure occurring within days
following an autologous HSCT indicated by multiple myeloma. There was no evidence of GVHD or myeloma
relapse. A complete remission of nephrotic syndrome with normalization of renal function were rapidly obtained by
corticosteroid therapy.
Conclusion: This is the first published case of acute renal failure due to MN occurring in the acute phase of an
autologous HSCT. These findings support the antibodymediated autoimmune glomerular disease.

Background
Acute and even chronic renal injury are known compli￾cations of the Hematopoietc Stem Cell Transplant
(HSCT) [1, 2]. They are attributed to overlapping causes
such as tumor lysis syndrome, ischemic tubular necrosis,
hemolytic uremic syndrome, infections and drugs in￾duced nephrotoxicity [2, 3].
Glomerulopathies represent only a small proportion of
such injury occuring in 1 to 6% of allogenic HSCT recip￾ients [4–6]. They typically manifest as membranous ne￾phropathy (MM) (64%), less commonly as minimal
change disease (19%) and rarely as proliferative glomer￾ulonephritis (17%) [7]. There is evidence to suggest that
these glomerulopathies might represent manifestations
of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) [8].
With the emergence of autologous HSCT, GVHD
should not exist. Nevertheless, Autologous GVHD has
been described in up to 10% of patients after autologous
HSCT [9], with involvement of skin, gastrointestinal
tract or liver [10].
Recently, there have been scarce reports of associated
MN in autologous HSCT population [11]. Some authors
have questioned the possibility of its integration into
GVHD while others considered it as a result of immune
dysregulation leading to a systemic autoimmunity mim￾ing chronic GVHD. We describe the first published case
of acute renal failure due to MN occurring in the acute
phase of an autologous HSCT and we will try to find an
explanation for its occurrence.

count 226,000/mm3 and prothrombin time 32 s (79%).
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 139/145,serum total
protein was 7, 8 g/dl (including 31% γ-globulin with a
monoclonal peak), Immunophenotyping: peak monoclo￾nal IgG Kappa, albumin 3,8 g/dl, creatinine 78 μmol/l,
blood urea nitrogen 7 mmol/l, calcemia 2,2 mmol/l,
blood uric acid 532 μmol/l. The 24-h urinary excretion
of total protein was 1 g/d with Bence-Jones proteinuria
of 0, 6 g. Bone marrow aspiration showed myeloma cell
infiltration in the bone marrow (31% of dystrophic
plasma cells). The diagnosis of IgG Kappa multiple mye￾loma was made and he began, in December 2013, his in￾duction treatment with Thalidomide-Dexamethasone
receiving 3 cycles with good response. Then, he under￾went in June 2014 autologous SCT with high-dose
melphalan.
During the second week, Autograft was complicated
by a urinary tract infection and sepsis Staphylococcus
hemolyticus with development of acute renal failure,
the blood creatinine level reaching 336 μmol/l. Renal
function improved on antibiotics but has not normal￾ized so the patient was referred to Nephrology when
his blood count was normalized for further evaluation
of his renal failure. At Nephrology (day 29), the blood
creatinine level was 260 μmol/l and multiple myeloma
was in total remission. However, there was a progres￾sive increase in proteinuria becoming nephrotic. Bence￾Jones proteinuria remained negative. A kidney biopsy
was then performed showing features of membranous
nephropathy (Fig. 1). No secondary causes were present
to explain the MN. He had undergone testing for hepa￾titis, syphilis, anti-thyroid antibodies, colonoscopy, PSA
screen, CT scan of lung, abdomen and pelvis, all of
which were negative. In addition, the patient’s serum
was tested for phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R)
autoantibodies, which were also negative.
The patient was put under renin-angiotensin system
blockers. Renal function improved (creatinine 160 μmol
/ l after 3 months), the proteinuria remained oscillating
between 3,5 and 11 g / l. After one year of monitoring,
diagnosis was discussed again on the basis of a recent
bibliography and a corticoid treatment, prednisone at
a dose of 1 mg / kg / day was introduced targeting
an autoimmune process. The outcome was favorable
with a decrease of proteinuria remaining between 0.6
and 0.8 g / d and a creatinine down to 103 μmol/l at
3 months of treatment. Corticosteroid degression was
started after 4 months motivated by the good evolu￾tion and development of cortico-induced diabetes.
Total duration of corticotherapy was 8 months. At
last check (in February 2017, one year after starting
corticotherapy), renal function was stable (creatinine
at 102 μmol/l), PLA2R autoantibodies and proteinuria
were negative.
Discussion
GVHD is a potentially lethal condition in which trans￾planted donor leukocytes (graft) attack the recipient’s
tissue (host) [12]. GVHD often occurs after HSCT and
may be acute or chronic. Acute GVHD presents within

100 days of transplantation and typically affects the skin,
gastrointestinal tract and liver [13]. Chronic GVHD oc￾curs more than 100 days posttransplantation, affects
multiple organs (skin, eyes, mouth, esophagus, liver, etc)
and often is associated with autoimmune features [13].
Chronic GVHD can occur after a history of acute
GVHD or as a de novo phenomenon.
Post-allogeneic HSCT glomerulopathies most often
manifest as nephrotic syndrome caused primarily by
MN [7]. GVHD is believed to be the cause of postallo￾geneic HSCT secondary MN [8] since the majority of
patients with post-HSCT MN had a history of acute
(68%) or chronic (75% to 84%) GVHD [7, 8, 14] and
since there is an increased incidence of post-HSCT MN
compared to the general population (0.6%–3.8% over
1–10 years in post-HSCT patients [7] vs an annual
incidence of 0.0012% in the general population [15].
With the emergence of autologous HSCT, GVHD and
its complications, quite common in allogeneic transplan￾tation,were expected to be eliminated. However, autolo￾gous GVHD has been described in some patients after
autologous hematopoietic HSCT.
Recent studies have indicated that two major factors
are necessary for the induction of autologous GVHD.
The first factor was a disruption of thymic-dependent
immune reconstitution and the second one was a failure
to re-establish peripheral self-tolerance [8].
Once the alloreactive T cells are released to the periph￾ery, they can be eliminated using a T-cell-dependent
regulatory system, however, due to the lymphoablative
preparative regimen that HSCT patients undergo, this
system is not functional [7, 16].
On another hand, autologous GVHD has been thought
of as an autoimmune syndrome and a milder form of
GVHD than its counterpart in allogeneic transplantation.
In recent studies, the presence of auto-antibodies in rela￾tion to the HSCT provides evidence for the involvement
of the B cell. A possible theory on how B cells can contrib￾ute to chronic GVHD is that the reconstituted B cells after
myeloablative conditioning may have impaired immune
tolerance of peripheral B cells, leading to the production
of autoantibody in chronic GVHD [17].
In autologous HSCT populations, there have been re￾ports of associated glomerular disease, as a result of any
type of immune dysregulation. Based on literature, 6% of
all patients with glomerulonephritis after HCT had re￾ceived Autologous transplants [7, 18, 19].
MN is encountered very rarely following autologous
HSCT (3% postautologous vs 97% postallogeneic HSCT
[7]. In this context of autoimmunity lymphokines would
alter the podocytes causing MN. New factors appearing
after the HCT could also play a role.
Nephrotic syndrome was described to be a late event
after HSCT either post alloneneic HSCT or autologous
HSCT. Indeed, nephrotic syndrome occurring in allo￾geneic HSCT patients has been considered to be a pos￾sible presentation of chronic GVHD of the kidney and a
decrease in immunosuppressive medication after HSCT
was associated with the occurrence of nephrotic syn￾drome within 9 months in 63% of patients [7, 20]. In the
last report of case of MN after autologous HSCT, pro￾teinuria appeared 5 years after HSCT.
Here we presented a case of a MN diagnosed few days
after a HSCT without features of acute GVHD. Primary
MN was initially evoked, however the absence of anti￾PLA2R antibody rendered the possibility of the coinci￾dental development of primary MN less likely. More,
our patient showed complete remission to steroid treat￾ment which is in favor of post-HSCT MN. Indeed, as
opposed to primary MN, corticosteroids, usually are the
first line of treatment for post-HSCT MN [6, 14, 21].
Conclusion
Although post HSCT MN likely represents a late mani￾festation of chronic GVHD in allogeneic HSCT, it may
also occur after autologous HSCT. Auto immunity
seems to be on the basis of its occurrence as supported
by the glomerular deposition of IgG and complement
components. Auto immunity could be acute and involve
only the kidneys as seen in our case. Corticosteroids are
the principal treatment toil and may be sufficient.
Through this observation, we recommend more
screening protocols of proteinuria and renal function
post HSCT.
