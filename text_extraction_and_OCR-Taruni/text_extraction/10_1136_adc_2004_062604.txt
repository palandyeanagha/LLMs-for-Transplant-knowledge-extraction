Abstract
Aim: To assess the relative accuracy of dynamic spiral computed
tomography (CT) compared with tracheobronchography, in a
population of ventilator dependent infants with suspected
tracheobroncho-malacia (TBM).
Setting: Paediatric intensive care unit in a tertiary teaching
hospital.
Patients and methods: Infants referred for investigation and
management of ventilator dependence and suspected of having TBM
were recruited into the study. Tracheobronchography and CT were
performed during the same admission by different investigators
who were blinded to the results of the other investigation. The
study was approved by the hospital research ethics committee, and
signed parental consent was obtained.
Results: Sixteen infants were recruited into the study. Fifteen had
been born prematurely, and five had cardiovascular malformations.
In 10 patients there was good or partial correlation between the
two investigations, but in six patients there was poor or no
correlation. Bronchography consistently showed more dynamic
abnormalities, although CT picked up an unsuspected double aortic
arch. Radiation doses were 0.27–2.47 mSv with bronchography and
0.86–10.67 mSv with CT.
Conclusions: Bronchography was a better investigation for
diagnosing TBM and in determining opening pressures. Spiral CT is
unreliable in the assessment of TBM in ventilator dependent infants.
In addition, radiation doses were considerably higher with CT.
