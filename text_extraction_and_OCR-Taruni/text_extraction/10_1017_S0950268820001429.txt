Abstract
While the majority of worldwide hepatitis E viral (HEV) infections that occur in people are
from contaminated water or food sources, there has also been a steadily rising number of
reported cases of transfusion-transmitted HEV (TT-HEV) in blood donation recipients. For
most, HEV infection is acute, self-limiting and asymptomatic. However, patients that are
immunocompromised, especially transplant patients, are at much higher risk for developing
chronic infections, which can progress to cirrhosis and liver failure, along with overall
increased mortality. Because of the rising trend of HEV serological prevalence among the
global population, and the fact that TT-HEV infection can cause serious clinical consequences
among those patients most at need for blood donation, the need for screening for TT-HEV
has been gaining in prominence as an important public health concern for both developing
and developed countries. In the review, we summarise evidence for and notable cases of
TT-HEV infections, the various aspects of HEV screening protocols and recent trends in
the implementation of TT-HEV broad-based blood screening programmes.
Introduction
Hepatitis E (HE) is considered to be the most common cause of acute hepatitis worldwide.
Initially, it was discovered through retrospective studies of cases of hepatitis in India [1].
The disease-causing pathogen, hepatitis E virus (HEV), was subsequently confirmed through
voluntary ingestion of infectious material by a Russian researcher, which was isolated and
visualised from his own stool samples following his own course of illness. HEV virus is a
small, non-enveloped, positive-template, single-stranded RNA virus, encased within an icosa￾hedral capsid of between 27 and 34 nm in size [2]. HEV infection typically follows a fairly rou￾tine clinical course, consisting of an incubation period of 2–6 weeks, followed by a few weeks of
pronounced detectable viraemia in both serum and stool along with corresponding symptoms
of hepatitis (abdominal pain, vomiting, hepatomegaly, jaundice, etc.). Resolution coincides
with a typical immune response of IgM antibody production that precedes the appearance
of more durable IgG antibodies. HE disease course is usually self-limiting; however, immuno￾compromised individuals can develop persistent chronic infections and are at risk for more
serious hepatic complications. Furthermore, pregnancy can pose unique risks when coinciding
with HEV infection, including higher rates of premature births, stillbirths and mortality.
Worldwide, HEV infection is mainly prevalent in Asia, Africa and Latin America, and can
occur either endemically or sporadically, though it is relatively uncommon outside developing
countries [3]. Among those populations at risk, the incidence of HE is higher among youth
than adults, with greater infection rates in men relative to women [4, 5]. Transmission routes
and geographic distribution of HEV typically stratify by genotypes [3]. The most predominant
forms of infections, types 1 and 2, occur via contaminated water sources through faecal–oral
routes, and are usually found in developing countries. In contrast, type 3 and 4 HEV infec￾tions, the predominant types found in the developed world, are thought to only be contracted
zoonotically, often the result from the consumption of contaminated sources of farm animal￾derived food products.
While these viral reservoirs supply the bulk of most HEV infections, HEV can also be trans￾mitted during blood transfusions [6]. Since the first reported transfusion-transmitted HEV
(TT-HEV) infection case in 2004 [7], more cases have successively been reported in Japan
[8, 9], France [10–14], the UK [15, 16], Germany [17] and Spain [18]. TT-HEV infections
are typically asymptomatic, similar to most cases of HEV infections that occur in developed
countries, and as such have historically been neglected [16]. Nevertheless, given the rising
trend of HEV serological prevalence among the general population (and by extension pro￾spective blood donors), and that TT-HEV infection can cause serious clinical consequences
especially among immunocompromised and pregnant patients, TT-HEV incidence has been
gradually receiving increased attention as an important public health problem in both devel￾oping and developed countries.

Evidence of transmission of HE through blood transfusion
Previous studies have shown a higher rate of anti-HEV immuno￾globulin (Ig)G positivity in patients who had received multiple
transfusions vs. those in the healthy control group [19–22], indir￾ectly indicating that transfusions, especially multiple transfusions,
may be a route for HEV transmission. Additionally, the transfu￾sion of human blood containing HEV into a macaque caused
HEV infection, also suggesting HEV may be transmitted through
blood [23]. However, the first direct evidence for TT-HEV infec￾tion from human-to-human blood transfusion was reported in
Japan [7], with cases successively reported in Japan [8, 9, 24],
France [10, 11] and the UK [15]. In all of these cases, the HEV
genomic sequence from the blood donor and patient matched
identically, thus confirming that the origin of the HEV infections
was from the blood donor and had been transmitted to the patient
from transfusion (see Box 1 for further details).
Detection of HEV infection
HEV can be detected either indirectly, by assaying serological
anti-HEV antibodies, or directly, by measuring HEV RNA or
HEV antigen levels in the blood. Each approach has a limited
time frame following diagnosis. The window for IgM detection
before seroconversion is 2–6 weeks following disease onset; at
this point, increasing alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity
can be detected, which lasts for 6–9 months. The appearance of
IgG is usually delayed compared to IgM, but can last for many
years. Both HEV RNA and HEV capsid antigen levels peak
early in the disease and last ∼4 weeks.
Serological antibody diagnosis
Commercial reagents include a traditional microplate ELISA
method and rapid immunochromatography. Anti-HEV IgM is a
marker for acute infection while anti-HEV IgG is a marker for
post-infection. The limit of detection (LoD) for most commercial
anti-HEV IgG is in the range of 0.25–2.5 IU/ml, though the more
sensitive detection commercial reagents (LoD: 0.25 IU/ml) are
often used for studying HEV epidemiology.
Serological antigen diagnosis
HEV viraemia can also be diagnosed directly through an
ELISA-based capture assay of HEV capsid antigens. It has been
reported that the specificity of antigen detection is high, but the
sensitivity is poor, and the detection limit is 800–80 000 IU/ml
[25]. While HEV RNA detection is far more sensitive and consid￾ered the ‘gold-standard’, antigen capture is simpler, cheaper and
faster, and would be suitable for laboratories that lack other
molecular diagnostic equipment.
RNA detection and identification
Assaying HEV RNA directly, either from blood, faecal or other
bodily fluid samples, is considered to be the ‘gold-standard’ for
molecular diagnosis of HEV infection. HEV RNA is detected
and quantified using a nucleic acid test (NAT), which involves
isolation of RNA followed by amplification via primer-mediated
enzyme extension. Protocols vary in clinical setups, but generally
HEV RNA detection employs isothermal, single-step nucleic acid
amplification technologies, such as transcription-mediated ampli￾fication (TMA) or reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal
amplification to great success [26]. TMA, in particular, is well sui￾ted for high-throughput detection of HEV RNA from multiple
serum samples on a fully automated commercialised platform
[27]. These technologies are highly sensitive and robust, with
detection limits in the range of 7–80 IU/ml, and, given such,
can be extended beyond clinical diagnosis to more broad blood
Box 1 TT-HEV case study details
Since the initial discovery of the HEV virus, the bulk of most HEV infections that were diagnosed among the general population occur from water/food-borne
contamination. Nevertheless, a small but significant proportion of cases of HEV transmission are known to occur from blood transfusions in patients that are
uniquely susceptible to some of the worst consequences of the disease. While several lines of evidence pointed to the potential for HEV infections deriving from
contaminated blood supplies [7–11, 15, 24], the first confirmatory evidence of direct donor-to-recipient transmission of HEV, as verified by RNA sequence
analysis, was reported in a patient in Hokkaido Japan in 2004 [7]. Since then, there have been several notable cases of TT-HEV infections reported worldwide,
underscoring the need for more prevalent testing procedures in blood banks. Details from these published case reports of definite TT-HEV infections are
summarised below:
• The first bona fide TT-HEV infection was reported in Hokkaido, Japan, in 2004. After the male patient developed acute hepatitis after a blood transfusion
during his cardiac surgery, one of the blood donors was found to be infected with asymptomatic HEV. Although the donor had normal alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) activity and no travel history, he tested positive for HEV RNA levels. RNA sequencing of both the patient and donor showed they had
identical genotype 4 HEV viral genomic sequences [7].
• In 2007, a patient with a T-cell lymphoma in Japan was diagnosed with an HEV infection lasting for 6 months. The patient received erythrocytes (RBCs) from 44
donors and platelets from 40 donors during chemotherapy. Subsequent investigation found that one of the RBC products was HEV type 3-positive [8].
• In 2008, a patient in Japan with Hodgkin’s lymphoma was infected with HEV type 4 after an autologous bone marrow transplantation and adjuvant
transfusion therapy post-chemotherapy. Further studies showed that one blood donor had eaten pork at a barbecue with 13 relatives 23 days before his blood
donation, with the donor’s father having died from acute hepatitis E and six of his relatives testing positive for anti-HEV antibodies [9].
• In 2004, another research group in Japan found that four patients having received ongoing haemodialysis tested positive for anti-HEV antibodies, and one of
them was confirmed to be infected with HEV type 3 from a blood transfusion [24].
• In 2006, a potential source for multiple TT-HEV infections was reported in the UK. The donor did not have contact with pigs or pork, and had no travel history.
He had no symptoms when he donated blood, but had transient influenza symptoms and jaundice after the blood donation. Cancer patients receiving RBCs
from the donor during chemotherapy were confirmed to be infected with HEV type 3 [15].
• In 2007, French doctors reported that a 7-year-old boy with kidney cancer, who had received concentrated RBCs and platelets from 22 blood donors after his
chemotherapy, was confirmed to be infected with HEV. The virus was found to have come from an asymptomatic donor of the HEV type 3f [10].
• Another case from France was reported in 2012, where an 81-year-old man with heart disease and autoimmune thrombocytopaenia developed persistent liver
damage after treatment for his haematologic disorders. After 3 months of misdiagnosis (drug-induced hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis and other
hepatitis-causing viruses were all eventually ruled out), he was finally correctly diagnosed as having contracted hepatitis from a TT-HEV infection from an HEV
type 3f [11].

screening protocols. The primers used in diagnosis are designed
to target the conservative genomic regions of all the different
HEV genotypes, usually flanking the viral gene open reading
frame 3 (ORF3). However, identification of HEV RNA can also
be achieved by sequencing other conserved regions of the HEV
genome, such as ORF2 or OFR1, and are often used to identify
particular HEV genotypes/subtypes or to track the source of
infection by phylogenetic analysis.
Serological viraemic prevalence of HEV among global blood
donors
While HEV is not routinely screened during blood donation in
most countries unlike other viral pathogens, there have been
many prospective studies that have been conducted looking for
markers of HEV infection in serum samples from potential
blood donors, so as to assess the local risk for TT-HEV infection.
The rates for various markers of HEV infection, namely anti-HEV
IgG, anti-HEV IgM and HEV RNA positivity, are summarised in
Tables 1–3, respectively. Broadly speaking, the overall rates of
anti-HEV IgG reactivity among blood donors in Europe ranged
from 4.7% to 52.5%, in Australia 6.0%, in central Asia from
14.3% to 21.48% and in the USA 16.0% [28]. These define
three levels of prevalence: low (anti-HEV IgG <10%), medium
(anti-HEV IgG: 10–20%) and high (anti-HEV IgG >20%).
Taken as a whole, these results found that countries with a high
rate anti-HEV IgG reactivity, such as France, Germany and the
Netherlands, had a correspondingly higher prevalence of viraemia
when compared to countries with lower seroreactivities (compare
Tables 1 and 3). In these same countries, however, the rates of
detectable HEV viraemia varied and is likely due to the differing
NAT strategies adopted by each group: this can dramatically
impact detection limits, false-positive and false-negative rates,
statistical power, whether sampling was pooled or based on indi￾vidual donations, etc. For example, in France, differences in rates
of viraemia were observed when a pool of 96 samples was initially
adopted (a rate of 1/2218 donors) [29] than when compared to
when an individual test mode was used (a rate of 1/744 donors)
[30] for similar regions. These studies also collectively found par￾ticular geographic distributions for TT-HEV genotypes: HEV
type 1 was found only in Asia and North Africa; HEV type 2
was found only in Mexico and South Africa; HEV type 3 was
found almost everywhere, in North and South America, Europe
and Asia; while type 4 was only reported for donors in Asia.
Recently, a comprehensive meta-analysis was published that
combined all anti-HEV IgG, IgM, HEV RNA and antigen￾positive rates among Chinese blood donors from 22 independent
studies [42]. The meta-analysis showed that the pooled positive
rates of IgG, IgM, HEV RNA and antigen in Chinese blood
donors were 29.2%, 1.1%, 0.1% and 0.1%, respectively, indicating
that China has a high risk of TT-HEV infection, which remained
steady from year to year. The anti-HEV IgG-positive rate differed
depending on the province in China: it was higher in the South
than the North, indicating that geographical region is an import￾ant factor affecting HEV infection, similar to previously published
data from other countries [72]. As with the report in France in
2011 [84], this study did not observe a significant association
between gender and prevalence of HEV infection, despite other
studies showing a gender bias for males having higher
anti-HEV IgG-positive rates [72]. Of note, the actual rate of
HEV RNA positivity in the Chinese blood donors might have
been an underestimate given that only those cases that were
counted in this meta-analysis were from Chinese blood donors
that were previously found to be positive for anti-HEV IgM or
IgG antibodies which excluded those that did not score initially.
This likelihood is underscored by a previous study from France
in which 22 out of 24 cases from 53 234 blood donors that tested
positive for HEV RNA were found negative for anti-HEV IgG
and IgM [29].
Worldwide blood donation HEV screening strategies
The screening of HEV RNA among blood donors is currently
recognised as the only effective means to prevent TT-HEV

infection. This is because risk factor assessment of blood donors
before donation is not effective for HEV, since all donors are con￾sidered to be at risk due to dietary factors [36, 85], and existing
blood virus inactivation techniques have been shown to be inef￾fective for HEV [13]. Ireland, the UK, France, the Netherlands,
Germany, Spain, Austria, Luxembourg [26], Switzerland [86]
and Japan [87] have all implemented screening protocols to
deal with TT-HEV, with several other countries following suit
[26]. Nevertheless, there remains a wide range of views on the
necessity for government-mandated HEV donor screening pro￾grammes given the myriad factors impacting screening strategy,
such as the prevalence of HEV in the region, cost–benefit of
screening, health resource availability, etc. For example, after a
cost–benefit analysis on the HEV blood donation screening strat￾egy currently used in the Netherlands, researchers concluded that
the cost of preventing TT-HEV through blood screening was not
excessively high compared to other blood screening programmes;
however, considering that only a small number of HEV infections

are due to blood transfusions, the overall impact on preventing
HEV spread would be small [88]. Meanwhile, in the USA and
Canada, a similar study concluded that HEV blood screening
would not be necessary because HEV prevalence in North
America is far lower than in most other developed countries,
meaning that the cost to implement would be expensive for little
benefit [89]. A similar conclusion was reached for both Denmark
and Sweden after evaluation of the prevalence of HEV RNA in
their respective blood donation systems [74, 90].
Universal vs. selective HEV screening
HEV screening strategies can be broadly classified into the follow￾ing two types: universal screening of all blood donors (used in
Ireland, the UK and the Netherlands) and selective screening
(used in France, Austria and Luxembourg). A selective screening
strategy refers to the screening of blood donation supplies only for
patients that are deemed at a high risk of developing complica￾tions from TT-HEV. Although the selective screening strategy
in principle may seem to be more cost-effective than a universal
screening strategy due to its more limited use, in practice it can
be more difficult to effectively implement. First, determining
which patients constitute a ‘high risk’ for HEV infection is cur￾rently problematic given the lack of a standard of definition for
what constitutes ‘high risk’. Conventionally, ‘high-risk’ patients
were deemed those that were immunocompromised (transplant
patients, HIV patients, cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy,
etc.) in addition to pregnant women and the elderly; however,

there is some debate as to whether to include patients with
rheumatoid arthritis and other rheumatoid diseases who receive
immunosuppressive drugs too. Second, blood transfusions are
often needed during emergency situations, and on-demand
screening for HEV in blood supplies for a ‘high-risk’ patient
will likely be impossible to perform under such time constraints.
Third, there is still a lot of debate as to whether HEV screening
may be necessary even for immunocompetent patients.
Although most immunocompetent patients that contract
TT-HEV infections are typically subclinical in presentation,
acute HEV infection and complications have been reported for
some [91–93]. Fourth, selective screening often incurs increased
cost logistics, as this creates two separate blood banks (HEV
screened and unscreened) which necessitates greater manpower,
material resources for classified storage and management, as
well as increased risk of waste from letting unused supplies expire.
ID-NAT vs. MP-NAT as HEV screening protocols
Currently, there is no universally adopted standard for choosing
between individual donation (ID)-NAT or mini-pool
(MP)-NAT protocols when screening for HEV in blood supplies,
and thus practices vary widely across laboratories worldwide.
While the sensitivity of ID-NAT is obviously higher than that
of MP-NAT, the cost of implementation can make ID-NAT pro￾hibitive for large-scale blood screening programmes. Even with
the inherent trade-off of cost vs. sensitivity, the main issue for
selecting a screening protocol is the lack of accurate data regarding
the minimum virus load (VL) of which TT-HEV infection can
occur [16, 26], and this can vary across different blood products
and sources for a variety of reasons. For example, while all
types of blood products can be a source for TT-HEV infections,
Dreier et al. [94] recently concluded that having more plasma
components carries a higher risk of transmission. Thus, products
with lower plasma volume components (such as red blood cells
and platelets) are less likely to transmit HEV compared to pro￾ducts with high plasma volume components (such as fresh frozen
plasma). They also reported that the median infectious dose
resulting in HEV infection was 520 000 IU, irrespective of the
immune status of the recipient. When combined with data from
Tedder et al. [85] that could not detect a TT-HEV infection in
recipients from donor samples with >19 000 IU, this means that
the minimum VL is likely between these extremes with the actual
value tilting closer to that latter’s estimates.
But perhaps the biggest hurdle towards achieving a reliable
minimum VL for TT-HEV is that quantification of HEV RNA
levels is subject to the detection limit of the analysis system
being used. Two recent studies have published that the detection
limits for two commonly used commercially available systems for
measuring HEV RNA in serum, an MP-96 protocol using the
RealStar RT-PCR HEV kit and the MP-24-based protocol using
the Cobas HEV assay, were 452 IU/ml (95% LoD 4.7 IU/ml)
and 446.4 IU/ml (95% LoD 18.6 IU/ml), for single donors,
respectively [95, 96]. While generally impressive, for standard
routine testing of blood banks, where detectable HEV viraemia
in pooled sample testing is often considerably lower than from
serum samples from patients with acute infection, this sensitivity
might be inadequate. For example, multiple reports from HEV
testing of blood donor samples out of Ireland showed that 59% of
HEV-reactive samples had a VL of <450 IU/ml [26, 37, 97, 98],
making them lower than the detection limits for either the
RealStar or Cobas HEV assays, and thus would have been deemed
as false-negative. Moreover, detection limits can vary even within
the same sample, depending on whether ID-NAT or MP-NAT is
used. Vollmer et al. [95] compared the results of MP-96-NAT
with a detection limit of 447.4 IU/ml (95% LoD 4.66 IU/ml
using the RealStar HEV RT-PCR assay) to ID-NAT (95% LoD
11.71 IU/ml using the Cobas HEV assay) in a German blood
donor cohort. It was found that the rate of ID-NAT positivity
was about 50% higher than that of MP-96-NAT. Nevertheless,
the VL for most of the positive samples was lower than 25 IU/
ml which would not normally cause TT-HEV, and thus, it was
suggested that there was no added benefit to implement
ID-NAT over MP-NAT-96 in screening German blood donation.
Finally, it should be noted that although the burden of disease
from blood products with a low VL appears to be small (especially
for immunocompetent patients), low-VL blood products can still
lead to TT-HEV. A case from Germany [17] was reported where a
possible TT-HEV derived infection that occurred in an immuno￾competent patient who accepted an apheresis platelet transfusion
from a single donor at levels that would have normally been
deemed below the minimum VL (120 IU/ml HEV RNA/ml
plasma; infectious dose of 8892 IU). This suggests that we should
probably re-evaluate what the lower VL threshold is for TT-HEV
in blood products for transfusion safety and disease burden over￾all, to better guide standard screening practices.
Summary and outlook
As the global incidence of HE continues to rise, medical author￾ities are finally coming around to acknowledging the growing
importance of HEV infection as a public health concern. In
2011, China’s State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA)
approved the first HEV-specific preventive vaccine. All of the clin￾ical studies using Hecolin (HE vaccine produced in Escherichia
coli (E. coli); Xiamen Innovax Biotech, China) were conducted
in China, and the results showed that the vaccine was effective
against genotypes 1 and 4 [99]. However, as of yet there are no
clinical trial data regarding the effectiveness of Hecolin among
high-risk populations nor of its effectiveness against type 3
HEV, the more common genotype among developed countries
outside of Asia. Moreover, the World Health Organization’s
Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety has recommended
that a Phase IV post-marketing study should be carried out to fur￾ther evaluate its safety before widespread implementation. While
vaccination remains an important stalwart in combatting HEV
infection more broadly, it would seem rather limited as an
approach towards preventing the transmission of HEV among
blood transfusion patients. Pathogen inactivation methods are
considered to be the best means towards eliminating viral con￾tamination of blood products, but current techniques are ineffect￾ive for HEV. Until newer blood treatment techniques are
developed, there appears to be no better way to prevent
TT-HEV infection other than by screening for HEV in blood
donation products. It is perhaps not surprising that global experts
disagree on the necessity and urgency of introducing HEV screen￾ing in blood donors, given its complexity in implementation,
cost–benefit considerations and few large-scale studies.
However, the overarching reason that limits widespread adoption
of HEV screening in blood donation is how rare TT-HEV infec￾tions are among patients. First, the spread of HEV is far more
likely to have happened from a contaminated food or water source
than from blood transfusion. Second, reports of TT-HEV infec￾tions remain scarce in the literature. This, however, is likely a
6 Hao Bi et al.

gross underestimation of incidence, given the often asymptomatic
outcome of infection and the lack of routine HEV screening,
which, collectively, reinforce the assumption of the rarity of
TT-HEV infections.
Going forward, the primary solution towards preventing HE
will be to monitor and break the faecal–oral transmission route
of HEV transmission, a laborious task that will require a cam￾paign of greater awareness among the general population.
Secondarily to that, food inspection should be enhanced, particu￾larly during processing, packaging and preparation, e.g. through
the promotion of hygienic diets (limiting raw meat), controlling
animal farm waste runoff into irrigation water reservoirs, etc. At
the same time, the implementation of HEV blood screening is
an effective and feasible preventive measure, albeit its cost￾effectiveness will need to be assessed on a regional and
population-specific basis. The hope is that the near future will
bring the continued development of more effective vaccines and
improved pathogen inactivation technologies that will radically
alter how we manage and constrain the spread of HEV infection.
