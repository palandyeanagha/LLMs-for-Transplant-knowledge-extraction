Sir,
Resolution of ocular involvement with systemic
eculizumab therapy in atypical hemolytic-uremic
syndrome
Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) is a thrombotic
microangiopathy, characterized by microangiopathic
hemolytic anemia, acute renal failure, and
thrombocytopenia.1 It is subdivided into D þ HUS or
D-HUS/atypical HUS (aHUS), depending on the
presence or absence of a diarrheal prodrome.2 Research
linked aHUS to genetic abnormalities in the complement
system proteins like: factor H, factor I, membrane
co-factor protein, factor CD46, factor B, and C3.3 Ocular
manifestations are rare and include retinal, choroidal,
and vitreal hemorrhages, retinal ischemic signs, and
non-perfusion.1,4
Case report
We first describe the outcome of eculizumab therapy in a
23-year-old female with aHUS complicated with bilateral
serous retinal detachment (SRD). She first presented
during the third trimester of pregnancy with
preeclampsia and HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver
enzymes, and low platelet count) syndrome, so she
underwent cesarean section. Following delivery,
thrombocytopenia persisted with elevated liver
transaminases and progressive renal failure. Kidney
biopsy was compatible with thrombotic
microangiopathy. After ruling out all possible differential
diagnosis, aHUS was strongly suggested as the
subsequent diagnosis. Treatment with plasmapheresis,
hemodialysis, and systemic steroids was conventionally
initiated.
Figure 1 (a) Color fundus photographs (upper) on presentation show shallow serous retinal detachment in the posterior poles with
cotton wool spots and small retinal hemorrhages most obviously seen temporal to the right fovea. The optic discs and the retinal
vessels looked normal. Optical coherence tomography of both eyes (lower) show subretinal fluid more in the right eye with small
hyperreflective exudates in the left papillomacular bundle. (b) Color fundus photographs (upper) and optical coherence tomography
(lower) show total resolution of serous retinal detachment 1 month later.

Eye

Subsequently, she complained of bilateral blurred
vision. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 6/60 RE
and 6/10 LE. Funduscopy revealed bilateral SRD, small
retinal hemorrhages, and cotton wool spots. Fluorescein
angiography showed leakage mainly around optic discs.
Optical coherence tomography showed bilateral SRD
(Figure 1a).
Treatment with plasmapheresis, hemodialysis,
antihypertensive medications, and systemic steroids was
reinstituted with partial systemic and ocular response.
Thus, systemic weekly eculizumab was added resulting in
prompt improvement of blood parameters, normalization
of urine output together with complete resolution of SRD
(Figure 1b). BCVA improved to 6/15 RE and 6/8 LE and
the eyes remained stable in a follow-up period of 2 months.
Comment
Eculizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against
complement protein C5a.3 Its beneficial
effects have already been demonstrated in patients with
paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.5 Recently,
it was also shown to be effective for aHUS as it
inhibits activation of the terminal complement
pathway.3
In conclusion, although ocular findings in HUS are
rare, prompt ophthalmological examination must be
performed in the presence of ocular complaints.
Eculizumab seems to be a promising treatment for
aHUS and its ocular complications.
