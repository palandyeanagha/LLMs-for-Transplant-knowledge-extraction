for the examination and safety issues, the second describes the primary techniques used in an examination, and
the third provides disease-specific protocols. Variations in practice are highlighted and expert consensus
recommendations are provided. Indications and appropriate use criteria for CMR examination are not specifically

Introduction
Over the past two decades, there has been a marked in￾crease in the use of cardiovascular magnetic resonance
(CMR) for the anatomical and functional evaluation of
congenital heart disease (CHD) [1-6]. CMR is rarely
used as the initial or sole diagnostic imaging modality.
Rather it complements echocardiography, provides a
non-invasive alternative to x-ray angiography, avoids the
ionizing radiation exposure of computed tomography,
and overcomes many of the limitations of these modal￾ities. Expert recommendations regarding the indications
for CMR in adults with CHD have recently been pub￾lished [7] and are underway for children with CHD. This
document focuses on the performance of CMR in chil￾dren and adults with CHD. The first portion addresses
preparation for the examination and safety issues, the
second describes the primary techniques or modules of
an examination, and the third provides disease-specific
protocols using these modules. The aim is to provide an
educational resource for those engaged in CMR in this
patient population and to help standardize the approach
to such patients. As much as possible we try to support
our recommendations by published evidence. However,
where data is lacking, the recommendations represent
an expert consensus view.
Examination preparation and safety
When applicable, parents should be provided with a de￾tailed description of the CMR examination and asked to
discuss it with their child in an age-appropriate manner
in advance to increase the likelihood of a successful
study. Prior to bringing the patient into the scanner
room, the physician and technologists should review the
patient’s history and safety screening form to identify
implanted devices which may be hazardous in the CMR
environment or produce image artifact. For patients who
may have undergone a cardiac procedure and have an

incomplete or unreliable history, a chest radiograph
should be obtained to assist screening. A detailed discus￾sion on CMR safety and device interactions can be
found elsewhere [8-10].
Following safety screening, physiological monitoring de￾vices and hearing protection (for both awake and sedated
patients) are put in place. Young children dissipate body
heat faster than adults; thus, patient temperature should be
monitored and blankets applied as needed to minimize heat
loss. A high-quality electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is es￾sential for optimum data quality in cardiac-gated se￾quences. The adequacy of the signal should be checked not
only at the onset when the patient is outside the scanner
bore, but also once inside it and during actual scanning. In
patients with dextrocardia, ECG leads are best placed on
the right chest.
The imaging coil should be chosen to maximize the
signal-to-noise ratio over the body region to be exam￾ined. Because CHD often involves abnormalities of the
thoracic vasculature, the coil will usually need to be
large enough to cover the entire thorax and upper abdo￾men rather than just the heart. In smaller patients,
pediatric thoracic coils or coils designed for an adult￾sized head, shoulder, or knee may be suitable. Adequate
coil coverage and placement should be confirmed early
in the examination by reviewing the localizing images.
Sedation
Patients undergoing CMR must remain still in the scanner
for up to 60 minutes to minimize motion artifact during
image acquisition and allow planning of successive imaging
sequences. Young children (typically less than age 6 to
8 years) and cognitively impaired older patients typically re￾quire some form of sedation. Multiple factors should be
taken into account when deciding whether a patient should
have an examination with sedation including the length of
the anticipated examination protocol, developmental ma￾turity, the patient’s experience with prior procedures, the
parents’ opinion of their child’s capability to cooperate with
the examination, the risks of sedation, and the benefits of
the diagnostic information.
Strategies for sedation and anesthesia during CMR
vary and often depend on institutional preference and
availability of resources such as pediatric anesthesiolo￾gists with experience in CHD. Sedation in infants youn￾ger than approximately six months can be achieved by
allowing them to fall into a natural sleep after a feeding
[11,12]. The baby is undressed, prepared with ECG-leads
and an oxygen saturation probe, and fed. As soon as the
infant starts falling asleep, it is swaddled or wrapped in
an immobilizer, provided noise protection, and placed
on the scanner table. With this “feed, swaddle, and
sleep” technique, scanning times of 30–60 minutes can
be achieved. However, this approach does not allow
suspension of respiration to reduce motion artifact. As
the study can be compromised by early awakening, the
imaging protocol should be tailored strictly to the
highest priority clinical questions.
Alternatively, deep sedation can be achieved with a
variety of medications (e.g., pentobarbital, propofol, fen￾tanyl, midazolam, and inhalational agents). Meticulous
care must be taken to maintain spontaneous breathing
under the supervision of an experienced anesthesiology
team. The principal drawbacks of this approach are an
unprotected airway and reliance on spontaneous respira￾tory effort with the associated risks of aspiration, airway
obstruction, and hypoventilation. A laryngeal mask airway
may be used in conjunction with deep sedation to decrease
the risk of aspiration. From an image quality standpoint, re￾spiratory motion artifact may reduce sharpness. However,
images acquired from sedated, freely-breathing patients are
often still of diagnostic quality as the breathing pattern
tends to be particularly consistent and thus quite amenable
to commonly available respiratory motion compensation
techniques.
Because of these safety and image quality concerns,
some institutions prefer to perform sedation using gen￾eral anesthesia with mechanical ventilation and endo￾tracheal intubation. This approach consistently achieves
adequate sedation, protects the airway, and offers con￾trol of ventilation. Respiratory motion artifact can be
eliminated by suspending ventilation for brief periods
(15–60 seconds) in conjunction with neuromuscular
blockade. Compared to deep sedation, general anesthesia
tends to require more specialized personnel and greater
equipment resources (e.g., a magnetic resonance (MR)
compatible anesthesia machine). Both the deep sedation
and general anesthesia strategies for CMR have been
shown to have a good safety profile in this fragile patient
population [13-18]. MR compatible equipment should
be used to monitor the heart rate, transcutaneous oxy￾gen saturation, blood pressure, expired carbon dioxide,
and body temperature. An appropriately equipped resus￾citation cart and emergency management plan for the
MR environment should be in place. To maximize pa￾tient safety and examination quality, it is recommended
that different healthcare providers be responsible for
supervising the imaging and sedation/anesthesia aspects
of the study, and that both communicate closely with
each other.
Gadolinium-based contrast agents
Gadolinium-based intravenous MR contrast agents
(GBCA) are commonly administered in CHD patients
of all ages for angiography and the assessment of myo￾cardial perfusion and viability. These agents are often
used “off-label” in children as several of them are not
approved by regulatory agencies, such as the United
Fratz et al. Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance 2013, 15:51 Page 2 of 26

States Food and Drug Administration or the European
Medicines Agency, for pediatric-age patients. The inci￾dence of adverse events related to GBCA in both adults
and children is very low [14,19-21]. The vast majority of
these reactions are mild and include coldness, warmth, or
pain at the injection site; nausea; vomiting; headache; pares￾thesias; dizziness; and itching. Severe, life-threatening ana￾phylactoid or nonallergic anaphylactic reactions are quite
rare (0.001% to 0.01%) [22]. There is no evidence indicating
nephrotoxicity at approved dosages.
GBCA administration to patients with acute renal fail￾ure or severe chronic kidney disease is associated with
the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF),
a rare and serious condition that involves fibrosis of pri￾marily the skin and subcutaneous tissue but may also in￾volve the lungs, esophagus, heart, and skeletal muscles.
Patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate <30
ml/min/1.73 m2 are considered at highest risk. Thus, all
patients who are candidates for GBCA administration
should be screened for renal dysfunction, and, if identi￾fied, the most recent institutional or national guidelines
regarding GBCA use should be consulted [22,23]. There
are only a small number of reported cases of NSF in
children (fewer than 20 as of 2010), the youngest of
which was 8 years of age [24,25], and all had significant
renal dysfunction [22]. No NSF cases have been reported
in preterm or term neonates despite their immature kid￾ney function and estimated glomerular filtration rates
which may be < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 [25]. Accordingly,
caution and a careful assessment of benefits and risk but
not prohibition are advised when administering GBCA
to neonates and infants [22,23].
Scanner field strength
Most CMR is performed on 1.5 T or 3 T scanners. In
general, 3 T yields a higher signal-to-noise ratio, and
therefore allows for better spatial resolution, which is
particularly desirable in younger, smaller patients. This
stronger signal and the inherently longer longitudinal
relaxation time (T1) at 3 T, typically lead to improved
clinical performance of coronary angiography, contrast￾enhanced angiography, myocardial tagging, and myocar￾dial perfusion imaging sequences. However, MR imaging
at 3 T has inherently stronger off-resonance artifacts
(B0-field inhomogeneity) and dielectric shading artifacts
(B1-field inhomogeneity). These factors translate to sig￾nificant dark band artifacts and loss of tissue contrast on
steady-state free precession (SSFP) pulse sequences and
signal loss on spin echo pulse sequences that are unpre￾dictable [26]. Strategies to reduce some of these artifacts
are currently under evaluation [27]. It is also worth not￾ing that implanted metallic devices (e.g., sternal wires,
stents, septal occluders, and vascular occlusion coils) are
commonly encountered in CHD patients referred for
CMR [28]. Device-related signal loss artifact from T2*
effects is typically more pronounced at higher field
strengths. Moreover, CMR compatibility information for
devices is more commonly available at the 1.5 T than
the 3 T field strength.
Common CMR techniques (modules) in CHD
This section focuses only on established CMR tech￾niques which are in routine use throughout the CMR
community and are available from all scanner manufac￾turers. The authors readily acknowledge that newer ap￾plications such as 3D phase-contrast flow measurement,
real-time and 3D cine imaging, and blood pool contrast
agents can be useful when performing CMR in CHD
patients.
Spin echo
Spin echo pulse sequences are typically used in CMR to
generate images in which flowing blood appears dark
and more stationary tissues appear as varying shades of
gray or white (Figure 1). The most common variants of
this technique are fast (turbo) spin echo (commercial
names: TSE, Siemens; FSE, General Electric; TSE,
Philips) and single-shot fast (turbo) spin echo (commer￾cial names: HASTE, Siemens; SSFSE, General Electric;
SSTSE, Philips). Both versions usually employ ECG￾triggering to compensate for cardiac motion and prepar￾ation pulses to suppress signal from blood and improve
image contrast. Respiratory motion can be addressed by
breath-holding, acquiring multiple signal averages, trig￾gering from respiratory bellows, or respiratory-navigator
gating. By utilizing half-Fourier k-space filling, the
single-shot technique acquires all the data to make an
image in one heartbeat and is thus very time efficient.
The fast spin echo technique collects data for one image

over multiple heartbeats and thus takes longer than the
single-shot technique, but it produces higher resolution
images.
In contrast to cine gradient echo techniques, spin echo
images are usually acquired during only one portion of
the cardiac cycle and do not depict motion; they are thus
typically used to provide anatomic information. Their
main advantage over cine imaging is that they are less
susceptible to artifacts caused by turbulent flow and me￾tallic implants such as sternal wires, septal occluders,
stents, and vascular occlusion coils (Figure 2) [28]. In
addition, a thinner slice thickness (≈2 mm) can be
achieved which may be particularly useful in smaller
patients. Fast spin echo sequences can also be modified
to alter image contrast (e.g., T1- and T2-weighting, and
fat suppression) and thereby help characterize tissue
composition.
For smaller patients, the operator should use a smaller
voxel size (adjusting both in-plane resolution and slice
thickness) to ensure adequate spatial resolution (Table 1).
If needed, the reduction in signal-to-noise ratio that
results may be offset by employing multiple signal
averages. Data acquisition should be timed to the por￾tion of the cardiac cycle in which the heart has the least
motion (i.e., the rest period) to minimize blurring. At
lower heart rates the rest period is often in mid-diastole;
whereas at higher heart rates (> 90-100 bpm) it may be
at end-systole. Fast spin echo sequences designed for
heart rates seen in adults usually acquire data every
heartbeat or every second heartbeat and thus the repeti￾tion time (TR) is equal to 1 R-R or 2 R-R intervals, re￾spectively. At higher heart rates, the R-R interval
becomes shorter and the time between data acquisition
will decrease resulting in less time for longitudinal signal
recovery and thus lower image quality. For rates greater
than 100 bpm, it may be helpful to compensate for this
effect by acquiring image data every third or fourth
heartbeat. Higher heart rates are also accompanied by
faster cardiac motion. With the fast spin echo sequence,
the number of echoes during the readout (echo train
length) can be decreased to reduce the image acquisition
(shot) duration and better resolve rapidly moving struc￾tures. With some implementations of spin echo imaging,
the blood suppression preparation pulse may become
ineffective at faster heart rates and blood will appear
brighter. Finally, the default blood suppression prepar￾ation pulse will not be effective following the administra￾tion of GBCA; thus, in most protocols evaluating
anatomy, spin echo sequences should be performed
prior to contrast agent administration.
Gradient echo cine
Gradient echo cine pulse sequences generate images in
which flowing blood appears bright (Figure 1). With the
use of ECG-gating, it produces multiple images across
the cardiac cycle that can be displayed in cine loop for￾mat to visualize motion, one of its main advantages over
spin echo sequences. Respiratory motion artifact can be
minimized by breath-holding (preferred when possible)
or by acquiring 2–4 signal averages with the patient
breathing. In clinical practice, this imaging sequence is
often prescribed across the anatomy of interest to yield a
stack of contiguous cross-sectional slices that can be
displayed in a multi-location, multi-phase format.
Gradient echo cine imaging can be performed using a
standard spoiled gradient echo pulse sequence or the
subsequently developed SSFP sequence (commercial
names: TrueFISP, Siemens; FIESTA, General Electric;
balanced-FFE, Philips). SSFP imaging is faster and pro￾vides superior contrast between blood and myocardium
compared to standard gradient echo imaging and is
thus more commonly used. The SSFP sequence is also

relatively less sensitive to flow disturbances caused by
stenotic or regurgitant jets. However, it is also more
prone to image artifact when there are inhomogeneities
in the magnetic field (B0) caused by suboptimal scanner
shimming or implanted ferromagnetic devices. Thus, the
standard gradient echo technique may be preferred for
visualization of flow jets or imaging near implanted de￾vices such as stents and mechanical valves.
When imaging smaller structures in younger patients,
the spatial resolution should be increased appropriately
(Table 2). Changes to accomplish this (e.g., increased
matrix size, smaller field of view, thinner slice thickness),
however, will prolong the echo time (TE). Once the TE
becomes > 2 ms and the TR > 4 ms, the quality of SSFP
imaging often deteriorates. One can increase the matrix
size only in the phase encode direction to improve reso￾lution without prolonging the TE, but this is done at the
expense of increased acquisition time. Thus, a careful
balance must be struck between spatial resolution, ac￾quisition time, and image quality. Alternatively, some
centers prefer to use high-resolution standard gradient
echo imaging with free-breathing and multiple signal
averages.
Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography
Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) using an
intravenously administered GBCA can produce a
high-resolution, high-contrast three-dimensional (3D)
dataset of the entire chest vasculature in a short scan
time, typically less than 30 seconds (Figure 3). As CHD
is frequently associated with abnormalities of the chest
vasculature, this technique is often employed in both
pre- and post-operative CMR imaging protocols. Stud￾ies demonstrating its utility and accuracy in patients
with CHD have been published for examination of the
aorta and its branches, pulmonary arteries, pulmonary
veins, systemic veins, aortopulmonary and venous￾venous collateral vessels, systemic-to-pulmonary artery
shunts, conduits, and vascular grafts [29-34]. The 3D
datasets generated by MRA are well-suited to volume
rendered displays which can enhance understanding of
complex spatial relationships and are more compre￾hensible to non-CMR specialists (Figure 3). Neverthe￾less, it is essential that the source data be carefully
reviewed by the reporting physician as anatomic infor￾mation may be omitted or distorted by the volume
rendering algorithm.
When possible, MRA should be performed with
breath-holding to minimize artifact from respiratory mo￾tion [35]. In smaller patients, one should ensure that
spatial resolution, both in-plane and partition thickness,
is sufficient. A contrast agent dose of 0.1-0.2 mmol/kg is
typically used. The time delay between the start of con￾trast injection and data acquisition will influence which
portions of the vasculature will be depicted. This interval
can be determined by a MR fluoroscopic method that
allows real-time visualization of the arrival of the con￾trast bolus to the targeted region, by a preceding timing
run with a smaller dose of contrast, or by automatic
bolus detection. Because the effect of the contrast agent

persists even during recirculation, two or three sequential
MRA data acquisitions are useful to ensure visualization of
all the vasculature. More recently, imaging acceleration
techniques have been applied to shorten the acquisition
time to 2–5 seconds thereby permitting multiple 3D vol￾ume sets to be acquired as the contrast agent passes
through the circulation producing a “time-resolved” MRA
[36-39]. A smaller contrast dose (0.05-0.1 mmol/kg) is often
used. This time-resolved approach has several potential ad￾vantages: 1) observing the passage of contrast may have
diagnostic benefits, 2) timing of the acquisition is less crit￾ical because multiple volume sets are obtained as the con￾trast passes through the circulation, and 3) it may have less
sensitivity to respiratory motion artifact. The principal
disadvantage with this technique is that the decrease in
acquisition time is usually achieved in part from a reduc￾tion in spatial resolution which may hinder diagnostic
accuracy, particularly in smaller patients. In addition, the
undersampling of k-space used to accelerate the acquisi￾tion may result in image artifact.
Both the standard and time-resolved contrast MRA
techniques do not utilize ECG-gating; therefore, motion
over the cardiac cycle causes blurring, particularly of the
aortic root, coronary arteries, and intracardiac struc￾tures. Another disadvantage is that the use of GBCA in￾curs some risk of adverse reactions (see above).
ECG and respiratory navigator-gated 3D SSFP
In its typical implementation, the ECG and respiratory
navigator-gated 3D SSFP technique delivers a 3D ana￾tomic dataset with an isotropic voxel size of approxi￾mately 1.2-2.0 mm without the use of a contrast agent
(Table 3). Its utility and validation have been reported in
patients with CHD [40-42]. Using ECG triggering, the
data acquisition is confined to one or two portions of
the cardiac cycle thereby minimizing blurring from car￾diac motion. Intracardiac anatomy and coronary arteries
can thus be more clearly visualized than with contrast￾enhanced MRA. The 3D SSFP sequence is performed
with free-breathing. Respiratory motion is compensated
for by gating data acquisition to expiration with the use of
a navigator beam tracking the motion of the diaphragm.
This approach allows for improvement in spatial resolution
including isotropic voxel size because scan time is not lim￾ited to the duration of a single breath-hold. The isotropic
property of the anatomic data permits arbitrary reformat￾ting in any desired imaging plane during review without
the loss of resolution (Figure 4).
The 3D SSFP sequence has four principal disadvan￾tages. First, its acquisition time is relatively long, usually
approximately 7–10 min, during which the patient must
be absolutely still. Younger children may have difficulty
with this level of cooperation. Second, the sequence is
very susceptible to artifacts caused by turbulent flow and
magnetic field inhomogeneity such as that caused by pres￾ence of stents or other ferromagnetic implants. Therefore,
vessels with stenosis or regurgitation, and structures around
stents can sometimes be misinterpreted. Third, the data is
confined to one or two portions of the cardiac cycle thereby
precluding the evaluation of cardiac and vessel motion. Fi￾nally, as with other ECG-gated techniques, image quality
will suffer when the patient has an irregular heart rhythm.
In such cases, generating stacks of thin SSFP localizer type
images in the cardinal planes during a breath-hold or
free-breathing with 2–3 signal averages may be a useful
alternative.
A version of 3D SSFP is generally the technique of
choice for coronary artery imaging in patients with CHD
(Figure 5) [43-46]. For this purpose in particular, data
acquisition must be confined to the rest period of the
cardiac cycle (i.e., that with the least motion) to
minimize blurring of these small, fast moving structures.

The rest period of the heart is chosen by reviewing a
high temporal resolution cine image of the heart (≥50
images per cardiac cycle), usually a 4-chamber view, and
identifying the appropriate trigger delay and acquisition
(shot) duration. Younger patients will typically have
faster heart rates and thus require a shorter acquisition
duration. Moreover, at higher heart rates (> 90-100 bpm)
the optimal rest period may be in end-systole. If a
patient has difficulty being still during the scan and
the primary diagnostic goal is to visualize the proximal
coronary arteries (e.g., suspect anomalous origin of a
coronary artery), it may be helpful to shorten the
scan duration by prescribing a smaller, more targeted
imaging volume around the aortic root rather than the
entire heart.
Ventriculography
CMR ventriculography generates cine images of the ven￾tricles that enable calculation of ventricular volume,
mass, and ejection fraction as well as evaluation of re￾gional wall motion. It is a specialized application of
gradient echo cine imaging described above. CMR is
widely considered the clinical reference standard for
ventriculography. It is particularly useful in situations
where echocardiography has significant limitations such
as in patients with poor acoustic windows and the evalu￾ation of the right ventricle or single ventricle. It is a key
component of the CMR functional evaluation in patients
with CHD.
In addition to the technical points mentioned in the
gradient echo cine imaging section, the use of retro￾spective rather than prospective ECG-gating is import￾ant so that the entire diastolic portion of the cardiac
cycle is evaluated. When possible, breath-hold acquisi￾tions are recommended, preferably at end-expiration as
diaphragmatic position tends to be more consistent from
breath-hold to breath-hold [47,48]. Parallel imaging or
partial Fourier techniques can be utilized to decrease
breath-hold time but at the expense of image quality
(e.g., poorer signal-to-noise ratio). Alternatively, free￾breathing imaging with the patient instructed to breathe
regularly and quietly, and multiple signal averaging
(2–4) can be performed. Proper attention to prescribing
an appropriate temporal resolution is essential to ad￾equately depict cardiac motion and capture the end-systolic
phase of the cardiac cycle. Cine CMR sequences often em￾ploy view sharing (also called echo sharing) to increase the

apparent temporal resolution by undersampling k-space
data for certain frames and utilizing data from adjacent
frames to fill the missing data [49]. Although these interpo￾lated frames smooth cardiac motion, they do not increase
the true temporal resolution of the sequence which can be
calculated as the product of the TR and lines per segment
(also called views per segment or turbo field echo (TFE)
factor). It is recommended that a minimum of 15 non￾interpolated images be acquired over the cardiac cycle (R-R
interval/(TR•lines per segment) ≥ 15). At the higher heart
rates typically seen in younger children, this will require
that the number of lines per segment be decreased to main￾tain adequate temporal resolution.
Imaging planes for ventriculography should be planned
carefully and include the following (Figure 6): 1) 4-chamber
(horizontal long-axis) view, 2) left ventricular 2-chamber
(vertical long-axis) view, 3) left ventricular 3-chamber view
including the mitral valve inflow and left ventricular
outflow tracts, 4) right ventricular 3-chamber (right anter￾ior oblique) view including tricuspid valve inflow and right
ventricular outflow, and 5) a stack of contiguous slices
which completely encompass both ventricles (Figure 7).
The data from the ventricular stack are used to calcu￾late ventricular end-diastolic volume, end-systolic vol￾ume, stroke volume, ejection fraction, and myocardial
mass using the summation of disks method. If the pa￾tient is expected to have limited tolerance for the
examination, acquiring the ventricular stack should be
prioritized.
There is practice variation regarding the orientation of
the ventricular stack. Some centers prefer to prescribe it
in a ventricular short-axis plane parallel to the atrioven￾tricular valve plane or perpendicular to the ventricular
septum (assisted by cross-referencing with the long-axis
images), and others prefer to prescribe an axial plane
(Figure 7) [50-55]. Furthermore, some advocate acquir￾ing data sets in both the short-axis and axial planes, or
two sets of short-axis planes—one oriented parallel to
the mitral valve plane and one oriented parallel to the
tricuspid valve plane as these may be offset, particularly
when there is right ventricular dilation. The principal ad￾vantages of the axial plane over the short-axis plane include
1) straightforward planning especially in patients with com￾plex ventricular morphology, 2) easier identification of
the atrioventricular boundary during post-processing,
and 3) more anatomic coverage of non-ventricular
structures (e.g., atria). Among its disadvantages are 1)
difficulty in evaluating left ventricular segmental wall
motion using established guidelines, and 2) a limited
evaluation of ventricular mass because the epicardial
and endocardial borders of the diaphragmatic wall of
the heart are not clearly defined. With either approach,
it is essential that the entire ventricle be included in
the image stack. For the short-axis orientation, cross￾referencing the slices on the 4-chamber view may
reveal the need to extend the stack above the tricuspid
valve plane in patients with a dilated right ventricle
(Figure 7).
The ventricular image stack is typically analyzed by de￾marcating endocardial and epicardial borders with the
assistance of software tools (Figure 8). Cross-referencing
the ventricular short-axis images with long-axis images
and observing wall motion in a cine fashion facilitate ac￾curate determination of the atrioventricular and semi￾lunar valves planes [56,57]. In the absence of right
ventricular hypertrophy, the epicardial boundary of the
thin-walled right ventricle can be difficult to detect.
When the left ventricle is in its normal systemic pos￾ition, the mass of the ventricular septum is counted as
part of the total left ventricular mass. When the right
ventricle is in the systemic position, there is no consen￾sus regarding to which ventricle the septal mass should

to planning standard ventricular views (right column) based on

Figure 7 Planning for ventriculography. An axial stack of cine images for ventriculography is planned by adjusting the slice locations on both
coronal and sagittal images (top row). A short-axis stack of cine images for ventriculography is planned by adjusting the slice locations on 4-
chamber (4C) and left ventricular 2-chamber (LV 2C) images in diastole (bottom row). Note that both the axial and short-axis stacks are prescribed
to ensure complete coverage of the left and right ventricles. In this short-axis example, the slices are oriented perpendicular to the ventricular
septum on the 4C view, and care is taken to ensure that coverage includes the anterior portion of the dilated right ventricle which extends
above the tricuspid valve plane. An alternative short-axis planning approach is to orient the slices parallel to the atrioventricular valve plane on
the 4C view (not shown).

Images may be acquired in a ventricular short-axis orientation (A and B) or in an axial orientation (C and D). There is practice variation regarding
whether to trace the papillary muscles and right ventricular trabeculations to exclude them from (A and C) versus include them in (B and D) the
blood pool.

be allocated. In patients with ventricular conduction
delay, which is relatively common in CHD, the end￾systolic and end-diastolic frames (i.e., time point in the
cardiac cycle) may not be the same for the right and left
ventricles and should thus be selected independently to
yield the minimum and maximum volumes respectively.
There is practice variation regarding whether to trace
the papillary muscles and right ventricular trabeculations
in order to exclude them from blood pool and count
them toward ventricular mass (Figure 8) [58-61]. Tra￾cing these structures will yield smaller ventricular vol￾umes, with little change in stroke volume but a higher
ejection fraction. Though theoretically more accurate,
this approach is time consuming in the absence of a reli￾able automated system and may reduce measurement
reproducibility.
Normative data on ventricular parameters by CMR are
available for both adults and older children [50,52,53,62,63];
there is still a need for robust data in patients younger than
8 years. Given the practice variations in the methods of ac￾quiring and analyzing the ventriculography image data
noted above, it is recommended that a center’s approach to
these issues correspond to that used in the normative
dataset that has been selected as the center’s reference
values. Although indexing ventricular volumes to body sur￾face area is a common practice, this does not fully account
for changes in body size from infancy to adulthood as the
volumes do not vary linearly with body surface area
[52,64,65]. Thus, a given indexed volume (e.g., end-diastolic
volume of 80 ml/m2
) may be normal for an adult but above
normal for an infant.
One of the strengths of CMR ventriculography is that
studies have demonstrated very good reproducibility in
children and adults with CHD [58,66-69]. To achieve
this level of quality and reliability, centers should main￾tain a rigorous and consistent approach to imaging and
analysis. Furthermore, to optimize interstudy reproduci￾bility in patients followed longitudinally, the ventricular
borders demarcated in the analysis software should be
saved so that they can be compared side-by-side with
those from subsequent studies.
Blood velocity and flow measurement
Velocity-encoded phase-contrast (PC) cine CMR is the
primary technique used to measure blood flow velocity
and volume. A detailed description can be found else￾where [70-73]. In brief, PC CMR is based on the
principle that the signal from hydrogen nuclei (such as
those in blood) flowing through specially designed mag￾netic field gradients accumulates a predictable and
measurable phase shift that is proportional to its vel￾ocity. A PC CMR pulse sequence produces two sets of
cine images: magnitude images that provide anatomic
information and phase images in which the velocity
information is encoded. On the phase images, the signal
amplitude (brightness) of each voxel is proportional to
mean flow velocity within that voxel. Maximum velocity
in one direction is displayed as the brightest white, max￾imum velocity in the opposite direction as the darkest
black, and zero velocity as mid-grey. Using specialized
software, regions of interest around a vessel are defined,
and the flow rate is automatically calculated from the
product of the mean velocity and the cross-sectional
area.
Blood flow measurements are an important element of
the CMR examination of CHD patients and have variety of
applications. Examples include measurement of cardiac
output [74,75], pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratio (Qp/Qs)
[76-81], differential lung perfusion [82-85], valvular regurgi￾tation [55,86-94], aortopulmonary collateral flow [95-97],
and pressure gradient [98-101].
For PC CMR flow measurements, the use of retro￾spective rather than prospective ECG-gating is preferred
so that the entire diastolic portion of the cardiac cycle is
evaluated (Table 4). The quality of the ECG-gating
should be carefully monitored, particularly during acqui￾sitions lasting several minutes. If the heart rate changes
significantly or there are frequent invalid triggers, the se￾quence should be stopped and repeated. Measurements
can be performed with free-breathing and multiple sig￾nal averages (2–4) or by shortening the scan time so that
it can comfortably be performed within a breath-hold.
The reduced scan time is usually achieved by reductions
in temporal and spatial resolution, as well as faster gra￾dient switching–all of which may increase measurement
error. Moreover, physiological changes can occur with
breath-holding that alter the measurements [102-104]
and may confound clinical interpretation. For these rea￾sons, the authors recommend free-breathing acquisi￾tions. The scan time of these measurements may be
reduced with the use of parallel imaging [80,105,106].
Accurate PC CMR measurements require sufficient
spatial resolution to avoid significant partial volume
effects. Specifically, there should be more than 3 pixels
across the diameter or more than 8 pixels in the cross￾section of the vessel or cardiac valve of interest [107,108].
Proper attention to prescribing an appropriate temporal
resolution is also essential because under-sampling will
smooth a pulsatile flow curve and cause inaccuracies. For
PC CMR, true temporal resolution (as opposed to interpo￾lated temporal resolution) equals 2•TR•lines per segment
(lines per segment is also called views per segment or TFE
factor). It is recommended that a minimum of 20 non￾interpolated images be acquired over the cardiac cycle (R-R
interval/(2•TR•lines per segment) ≥ 20). At the higher heart
rates typically seen in younger children, this will require
that the number of lines per segment be decreased to main￾tain adequate temporal resolution. Finally, with PC CMR

measurements, the operator must set the velocity range
(venc) prior to running the pulse sequence; velocities which
exceed this range will alias and be misrepresented (Figure 9).
It is recommended that the venc be set to approximately
25% above the expected maximum velocity so as to
optimize the dynamic range. When blood velocity is in￾creased, such as in the setting of valve or vessel stenosis,
the operator’s choice of venc may be guided by information
from recent echocardiography. If aliasing occurs, the meas￾urement should be repeated using a higher venc or the data
may be rescaled with cautious use of post-processing
software.
Careful positioning of the PC CMR imaging plane is
essential for accurate velocity and flow measurements. It
should be aligned strictly perpendicular to the blood
vessel’s or valve’s orientation using two orthogonal plan￾ning views in order to minimize partial volume effects
(Figure 10), and the velocity encoding direction should
be set to the through-plane direction. The vessel of
interest should be as close to the scanner’s isocenter as
possible to maximize gradient fidelity (Figure 11). This is
accomplished by prescribing the plane so that the center
of the image is at the same level as the vessel in the
superoinferior direction. The scanner will then slide the
patient table so that the center of the imaging plane and
thus the vessel is close to the scanner’s isocenter. Place￾ment of the imaging plane in regions of turbulent flow
should be avoided as such flow can lead to signal loss
and inaccuracies. Similarly, positioning of the imaging
plane away from ferromagnetic implanted devices is
recommended as these disrupt the magnetic field
gradients.
There is some uncertainty and practice variation re￾garding the optimal location for semilunar valve flow

measurements are most accurate when the location of interest is at the isocenter of the scanner during the acquisition. Most MR scanners will
slide the patient table so that the center of the imaging plane (yellow circle) is at the scanner’s isocenter (vertical red line). Prescribing the
imaging plane so that the center of the image is at the same level in the superoinferior dimension as the location of interest is
therefore recommended.

measurement. A position closer to the annulus has the
potential advantages of a less complex flow pattern,
reduced impact of vessel compliance, and exclusion of
coronary flow in the case of the aortic valve [109].
Through-plane motion, however, is greatest near the
annulus, and this contributes to measurement error
[110,111] and precludes precise placement between the
annulus and coronary ostia throughout the cardiac cycle
using standard two-dimensional (2D) PC CMR. Most
operators typically place the imaging plane at the
sinotubular junction or proximal ascending aorta to
measure aortic valve flow, and in the middle of the main
pulmonary artery to measure pulmonary valve flow
[112]. Atrioventricular valve inflow or regurgitation vol￾ume can be quantified indirectly through several differ￾ent comparisons of ventricular stroke volume measured
by ventriculography and semilunar valve flow measure￾ment by PC CMR [55,88,94,112-115]. Atrioventricular
valve inflow can also be quantified directly with PC
CMR by prescribing a location perpendicular to the in￾flow direction [116,117]; to ensure that this plane re￾mains apical to the valve throughout the cardiac cycle, it
should be positioned at the annular level on an end￾systolic image. Again, through-plane motion will com￾promise the accuracy of flow measurements made with
conventional 2D PC CMR [111,118,119].
PC CMR has been utilized to estimate the pressure
drop across discrete stenoses in valves and vessels by
measuring the maximum flow velocity and applying the
modified Bernoulli equation. A useful way to plan this is
to prescribe a PC CMR imaging plane parallel to the
direction of blood flow setting the velocity encoding dir￾ection in the same in-plane direction, and then to pre￾scribe a second PC CMR acquisition with through-plane
encoding perpendicular to the location of the peak in￾plane velocity. However, the authors recommend that
PC CMR measurements of peak velocity be applied cau￾tiously as there are a number of factors that may lead to
erroneous velocity measurements (typically an underesti￾mate) including difficulty aligning with complex flow
jets, partial volume effects, insufficient temporal reso￾lution, signal loss, and misregistration artifacts.
As with PC CMR acquisitions, the post-processing of
the image data requires careful attention to detail. The
target vessel must be accurately identified and a region
of interest should be drawn on the outer margin of the
lumen. Automatic border detection tools in most soft￾ware programs are fairly accurate; however, the contours
should be reviewed on each image, as the vessel moves
and changes size during the cardiac cycle. Abnormal sig￾nal, such as susceptibility artifact from air in the lungs,
should be carefully excluded from the region of interest.
PC CMR velocity and flow measurement, like all quan￾titative techniques in clinical medicine, has sources of
error and limitations, and it is essential that reporting
physicians have a good understanding of them. These
include inappropriate setting of the venc, signal loss
with complex turbulent flow, partial volume averaging,
signal misregistration, and phase offset errors due to
eddy currents or uncorrected concomitant gradients
[70-72,110,120,121]. Adherence to the guidelines above
will minimize these concerns but phase offset errors are
particularly troublesome as they are often difficult to de￾tect and may have a significant impact on accuracy. On
some scanners it may be advisable to subtract the back￾ground velocity or flow measured on a stationary phan￾tom from that measured on the patient’s PC CMR
images [122-124]. Through-plane motion of the heart
and blood vessels may impact the accuracy of flow mea￾surements [110,111,118]. 3D PC CMR sequences along
with specialized post-processing analysis software can
compensate for this motion though its use is not yet
widespread [119,125-129]. In all cases, PC CMR data
should be scrutinized to ensure that they are consistent
with the known information about the patient’s condi￾tion and with the other CMR data from the examination.
For instance, the net flow in the main pulmonary artery
and ascending aorta should be approximately equal in
patients without any evidence of a shunt, net main pul￾monary artery flow should equal the sum of the net
branch pulmonary artery flow, and flow in a great vessel
should agree well with the corresponding ventricular
stroke volume from ventriculography (in the absence of
atrioventricular valve regurgitation or a shunt). When
data is incongruous, one of the known limitations de￾scribed above can usually be identified.
Vasodilator myocardial perfusion
Vasodilator perfusion is primarily used to assess patients
for inducible myocardial ischemia (Figure 12). It relies

on the principle that administration of a coronary
artery vasodilator (e.g., adenosine, dipyridamole, and
regadenoson) will cause a greater increase in the perfu￾sion of myocardium supplied by normal coronary arter￾ies than myocardium supplied by stenotic coronary
arteries. Perfusion is assessed by administering an intra￾venous dose of a GBCA and then rapidly imaging the
ventricles at multiple locations to visualize the enhance￾ment pattern during the first transit of the contrast
bolus through the myocardium. The appearance of con￾trast will be attenuated, both in amplitude and rate, in
regions of compromised coronary blood flow. Typically,
a perfusion scan is run both at rest and with vasodilator
infusion in order to distinguish fixed perfusion defects
(e.g., infarct) from inducible ones. As adenosine is the
most commonly used vasodilator medication, the subse￾quent discussion will focus on this agent.
Vasodilator perfusion CMR has been shown to have
similar or superior sensitivity and specificity to nuclear
cardiology techniques for detecting significant coronary
artery stenosis in adult patients [130-133]. Moreover, the
results of perfusion CMR have been shown to have
prognostic value in adults with coronary heart disease
[134,135]. Reports of adenosine perfusion CMR for the
assessment of coronary artery disease in children and
adults with CHD have been limited to small studies
[136-140]. It is increasingly being used to assess patients
with chest pain, anomalous origins of the coronary arter￾ies, and after surgeries which involve coronary artery re￾implantation (e.g., the arterial switch or Ross opera￾tions). However, it is important to note that adenosine
mainly induces myocardial blood flow inhomogeneities
by vasodilatation and steal effects that do not necessarily
represent the pathophysiology of coronary artery prob￾lems found in CHD patients. Furthermore, it is unclear
whether exercise induced ischemia caused, for example,
by an anomalous coronary artery coursing between the
arterial roots can be detected by adenosine perfusion
CMR. In some settings it may, therefore, be preferable
to use other “stress” agents such as dobutamine [141] or
another imaging modality in conjunction with exercise
stress.
Vasodilator perfusion CMR has been performed using
a variety of pulse sequences; a detailed review can be
found elsewhere [142]. In brief, strong T1 contrast is
provided by a preparation pulse such as inversion
recovery or saturation recovery (Table 5). This is
followed by fast imaging using a gradient echo, gradient
echo-planar, or SSFP acquisition. Parallel imaging tech￾niques are widely used as a means for accelerating image
acquisition. These sequences create images of the heart
in one heartbeat rather than acquiring data from mul￾tiple cardiac cycles to build an image as is the case for
standard cine CMR. A minimum 3 short-axis slices
should be prescribed to ensure coverage of all but the
apical left ventricular segment. Additional short-axis or
long-axis slices may also be useful. At the slower heart
rates typically found in adult patients, the cardiac cycle
length is long enough to allow acquisition of 3–5 slice
locations during each beat (Figure 13). The slice loca￾tions are timed to different phases of the cardiac cycle
but each location is acquired repeatedly at the same
phase. At the higher heart rates (and shorter cardiac
cycle lengths) seen in younger patients, fewer locations
can be acquired in one beat. Thus, it may be advanta￾geous to spread the imaging period for the slices over
two heartbeats so that a sufficient number of locations
can be acquired–each location every other beat. Spatial
resolution should also be increased in smaller patients.
Detailed instructions on how to perform an adenosine
perfusion CMR protocol have previously been published
[143-145]; the basic steps follow here. Prior to undergo￾ing adenosine perfusion CMR, the patient should be
screened for contraindication to adenosine administra￾tion including second or third degree heart block, sinus
node dysfunction, severe asthma or obstructive pulmon￾ary disease, and pregnancy. Caffeine, aminophyline,
and nitrate intake should be avoided on the day of the
examination as these agents interfere with the action
of adenosine. A specific consent procedure should be
undertaken to inform the patient/guardian of potential
side effects and complications such as dyspnea, flushing,
headache, light-headedness, blurred vision, nausea,
bronchospasm, heart block, and hypotension. It is pref￾erable to have two intravenous lines in separate veins
—one for adenosine and one for contrast agent admin￾istration—in order to avoid a bolus dose of adenosine
with contrast administration. Monitoring equipment
should include a continuous ECG recording and blood
pressure cuff placed on the arm not being used for the
adenosine infusion. Equipment and qualified personnel
for resuscitation must be available.
The consensus group authors recommend performance
of the vasodilator perfusion acquisition first followed by the
rest acquisition with at least 15 minutes between the two so
as to minimize contamination of the rest images by residual
contrast given during the vasodilator infusion. An adeno￾sine dose of 0.14 mg/kg/min is typically used though the
adequacy and safety of this dose has not been thoroughly
established in the pediatric age group. After the adenosine

has been infusing for 3 minutes, a GBCA (0.05-0.1 mmol/
kg) is rapidly injected followed by a saline flush. In adult￾size patients, rates of 5 ml/s with 25 ml of flush are
recommended. In children, a minimum rate of 3 ml/s
through an appropriate size intravenous line and 10 ml
flush is suggested. The perfusion imaging sequence is
started simultaneously with the contrast agent infusion, and
its scanning duration should be set to acquire approxi￾mately 60 heartbeats. In order to minimize respiratory mo￾tion artifact, breathing should be suspended as long as
possible during the image acquisition. If breath-holding is
not possible, the patient should be instructed to breathe
shallowly. Once the imaging is completed, the adenosine
infusion is discontinued. Adenosine should be terminated
earlier if the patient develops persistent or symptomatic
heart block, significant hypotension, or severe respiratory
difficulty. An intravenous dose of aminophylline can be
used to rapidly counteract the effects of adenosine. The
same contrast infusion protocol and pulse sequence param￾eters as used in the adenosine perfusion segment should be
used later for the rest perfusion imaging.
Though quantitative analysis of perfusion imaging
[146] is possible using commercially available image ana￾lysis software, this process remains time-consuming to
perform and is subject to technical challenges. Visual
analysis by an experienced reader is usually sufficient for
routine clinical practice. Interpretation is also guided by
review of the cine images of ventricular function and
late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) images [147]. In the
absence of LGE, homogeneous enhancement in all loca￾tions at rest and with the vasodilator indicates no indu￾cible ischemia. A region with transmural LGE and
perfusion defects at rest and with the vasodilator, a so￾called “fixed defect”, is also interpreted as the absence of
inducible ischemia. A region that has a perfusion defect
with vasodilator but is normal at rest and has no LGE is
diagnostic of ischemia. Perfusion defects should be
reported as either full thickness or partial thickness
(sub-endocardial) with the affected region of the left
ventricle described using the standard 17-segment
American Heart Association model [148].
On some perfusion scans there may be a rim of re￾duced signal intensity in the subendocardium, which can
mimic a hypoperfused area [145,149]. Compared to a
true subendocardial perfusion defect, this dark rim
artifact typically lasts for only a few heartbeats and then
fades away. The dark rim artifact is more commonly
seen with high heart rates, a more concentrated contrast
bolus, and the use of a balanced SSFP rather than a gra￾dient echo based perfusion sequences.
Late gadolinium enhancement
LGE, also known as myocardial delayed enhancement, is
a technique that detects focal regions of myocardial fi￾brosis and infarction. It is based on the observation that
GBCA have slower washout and an increased volume of
distribution in fibrotic and necrotic myocardium. Thus,
such areas appear brighter than normal myocardium on
LGE images. Validation studies have correlated the find￾ing of LGE with the presence and extent of myocardial
fibrosis detected by histology in animal models and in
humans [150-152]. Reports in adults have demonstrated
its clinical utility in acute and chronic ischemic heart
disease, cardiomyopathies, myocarditis, and ventricular
thrombus detection. In CHD, LGE has been described in
patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot [153-155], atrial
switch operations for transposition of the great arteries
[156], Fontan operations for functionally single ventricles

cardiac cycle length is long enough to allow acquisition of 4 slice locations during each beat. The slice locations are timed to different phases of
the cardiac cycle, but each location is acquired repeatedly at the same phase in subsequent cycles. At a heart rate of 120 bpm (B), the cardiac
cycle length is shorter so only two slice locations can be acquired over each beat; the other 2 locations are acquired the following beat. Note
that the temporal resolution (images per unit time) is the same in A and B.

after repair [162], endocardial fibroelastosis (Figure 15)
[163,164], and fibrous tissue along regions of reconstruction
in patients who have had surgery for CHD [165]. In the tet￾ralogy of Fallot, atrial switch, and Fontan operation cohorts,
the presence of LGE has been associated with adverse ven￾tricular mechanics, exercise intolerance, and ventricular ar￾rhythmias [153,155-158]. Nevertheless, the pathophysiology
and prognostic impact of LGE in patients with CHD has
not been fully established [166].
LGE imaging is performed 10–20 minutes following
injection of 0.1-0.2 mmol/kg of a GBCA. In many im￾aging protocols, the contrast dose is initially used to per￾form a MRA. For LGE imaging, an ECG-gated 2D
segmented inversion recovery gradient echo pulse
sequence is typically used with data acquisition timed to
coincide with the cardiac rest period to minimize mo￾tion blurring. Three-dimensional LGE sequences are
available but are less well validated [167,168]. Breath￾hold imaging is preferred though multiple signal average
imaging, respiratory navigator gating, or single-shot im￾aging can be used with free-breathing. Imaging planes
and slice thickness should match those used for cine
imaging of the ventricles to facilitate comparison. A
comprehensive examination would include LGE imaging
in short-axis, LV 2, 3 and 4-chamber, and RV 3-chamber
views.
In order to improve the image contrast between nor￾mal myocardium and regions of increased gadolinium
concentration, an inversion pulse is incorporated into
the pulse sequence. The time between the inversion
pulse and image acquisition, known as the inversion
time (TI), should be set to null normal myocardium.
Selecting the appropriate inversion time may be facili￾tated by imaging iteratively with different TIs, or by the
use of a TI-scout or Look-Locker sequence. Alterna￾tively, a phase-sensitive sequence with a standardized TI
based on dose, timing, and heart rate may be used [169];
such sequences provide consistent contrast between in￾farcted/fibrotic and normal myocardium over a wider
range of TIs. Because the gadolinium concentration in
normal myocardium decreases with time, the optimal TI
will become longer as time elapses. Accordingly, if the
time it takes to acquire all of the LGE images becomes
prolonged, the TI value may need to be updated to a
longer value. Initial reports suggested that the inversion
time to null myocardial signal is shorter for the RV (in
the usual subpulmonary position) than the LV [170,171].
However, a more recent study showed that the inversion
times to null myocardium are quite similar for both ven￾tricles, and that the apparent difference was related to
insufficient spatial resolution for the thin-walled RV
[172]. Thus high spatial resolution is required to prop￾erly assess for LGE on thin-walled ventricles.
Performing the LGE technique in children requires modi￾fications to address smaller-sized ventricles and faster heart
rates (Table 6). In order to ensure adequate spatial reso￾lution, voxel size should be 1.0-1.5 mm in-plane with a
thickness of 5 mm. The resulting decreased signal-to-noise
ratio can be compensated for by performing two signal av￾erages, albeit at the expense of a longer acquisition time. At
higher heart rates (>100 bpm), in order to allow time for
adequate longitudinal signal recovery between successive
inversion pulses and avoid excessive signal loss, the interval
between data acquisition should be increased from every
second cardiac cycle to every third or fourth cycle
(Figure 16). If the scanner software does not allow easy ad￾justment of the data acquisition interval, one can try manu￾ally halving the entered heart rate which may extend the

scanner’s no-trigger interval and double the data acquisition
interval. In addition, the data acquisition (shot) duration
should be decreased by reducing the views per segment
(turbo factor) to minimize blurring from faster cardiac mo￾tion at the higher heart rate.
Although image analysis software can be used to ob￾jectively quantify the extent of enhanced myocardium
[173], qualitative visual interpretation is typically
performed in clinical practice. The involved cardiac seg￾ments can be reported according to the 17-segment left
ventricular model [148] and a 9-segment right ventricu￾lar model [155]. In addition, it is helpful to note the ex￾tent of the wall thickness that is involved and the
pattern of enhancement (e.g., subendocardial, mid-wall,
subepicardial, global endocardial, septal insertion sites,
and patchy). Selection of the appropriate TI is crucial for
producing valid LGE images and maximizing the image
intensity difference between normal and infarcted/fi￾brotic myocardium. If the TI is too short, the image in￾tensity of normal myocardium will be increased and that
of abnormal myocardium decreased (or even nulled)
leading to gross misinterpretation. If the TI is set too
long, the relative contrast between normal and abnormal
myocardium will be reduced and sensitivity diminished.
Ghosting artifacts can result from regions that have a
long T1 such as pericardial fluid or cerebrospinal fluid
[174]. Artifact from cerebrospinal fluid can be removed
by placement of a saturation band over the spinal cord.
In addition, it is worthwhile to confirm the presence
of enhancement by repeating LGE imaging in an or￾thogonal plane or by swapping the phase and fre￾quency directions of the initial acquisition.
Finally, subendocardial, papillary muscle, and right
ventricular wall enhancement may be inconspicuous
when adjacent to a relatively bright blood pool.
Interpreting the LGE images side-by-side with the cine
images addresses this pitfall as these will provide infor￾mation regarding wall thickness and papillary muscle
position [174]. Moreover, performing LGE imaging
later after contrast agent administration (or using a
lower contrast agent dose) will lead to a lower blood
pool signal and usually improved contrast against the
bright enhanced regions.
Disease-specific protocols
This section provides suggested disease-specific CMR
protocols using the modules reviewed above. For con￾ciseness, the ventriculography and LGE modules are
listed once in detail at the beginning and then simply re￾ferred to in the disease-specific protocols. Similarly, the
abbreviations used in the protocols are listed below for
easy reference. PC CMR acquisitions are with through￾plane velocity encoding unless otherwise indicated. With
each condition, important data to include in reporting
the examination are listed in a key reporting elements
section. Both the CMR protocols and reporting elements
Figure 16 Schematic diagram illustrating data acquisition timing in a late gadolinium enhancement sequence. Each rectangle represents
data acquisition timed to coincide with the cardiac rest period and during which a user-defined number of k-space lines are filled. Multiple data
acquisitions and thus cardiac cycles are required to fill k-space and produce an image. At a heart rate of 80 bpm (A), data acquisition occurs
every second cardiac cycle in order to allow sufficient time for recovery of longitudinal signal. At a heart rate of 120 bpm (B), the cardiac cycle
length is shorter so the sequence is modified to acquire data every third cycle in order to maintain the same time for the recovery of
longitudinal signal. In addition, the data acquisition duration is shortened to compensate for the briefer cardiac rest period associated with a
faster heart rate.
