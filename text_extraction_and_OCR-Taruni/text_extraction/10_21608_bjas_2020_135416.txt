Abstract
Preterm birth is a leading cause of perinatal mortality and morbidity and has adverse long –term consequences for
the child health. The vast majority of morbidity and mortality relates to early delivery before 32 weeks. to evaluate
whether the prophylactic administration of vaginal progesterone would reduce the preterm birth rate in singleton high￾risk pregnancies. This prospective,observational study included 100 cases of high risk pregnant women admitted to
Obstetrics and Gynaecology Departments in Benha University and El Bagour General Hospital. Participants were
divided into two groups: a Study Group including 50 pregnant women under treatment by prophylactic progesterone 
vaginal suppository [prontogest 400mg vaginal suppository from period of 28 – 34 weeks and a Control Group:-
including 50 pregnant women not treated by progesterone vaginal suppository. The incidence of preterm deliveries in
the study group was significantly lower than that of the control group [38% versus 56%], the postnatal morbidity was
significantly lower [6% versus 15%] while the postnatal mortality was significantly different. Our results indicate that
the progesterone therapy significantly reduces the incidence of preterm delivery. The study concludes that vaginal
progesterone reduces the risk of PTB,NICU admission,RDS in singleton high-risk pregnancies.

1.Introduction
Preterm birth [PTB] is defined as delivery of a viable
pregnancy at less than 37 completed weeks of gestation.
The lower limit of viability exoutri generally accepted to
be at 23 completed weeks. Birth before 23 completed
weeks of gestation is classified as either miscarriage or
abortion [1].
Preterm birth is an important perinatal health problem
all over the world as its rates have been reported to range
from 5% to 7% of live births in some develoed countries
and higher in developing countries [2].
Preterm birth is due to one of three clinical
conditions: medically indicated [iatrogenic] preterm
birth, preterm premature rupture of membranes
[PPROM] and spontaneous [idiopathic] preterm birth.
Medically indicated preterm birth in the absence of
PPROM or spontaneous preterm labor occurs in about
25% of all preterm births with variations from 8.7% -
35.2 % according to reports and studied populations [3].
The incidence of iatrogenic preterm birth is
increasing with decrease in the incidence of spontaneous
preterm birth. There are attempts to analyze, interpret
and decrease preterm birth rates which consider
spontaneous and iatrogenic preterm births separately [4].
Preterm birth is a leading cause of perinatal mortality
and morbidity and has adverse long –term consequences
for the child health [5]. The vast majority of morbidity
and mortality relates to early delivery before 32 weeks
[6].
Economically, PTB has a major and significant direct
and indirect cost. There is a direct cost in terms of
clinical resources use, as Intensive and prolonged
neonatal care as in- patient followed by higher rate of re
hospitalization following discharge and emotional,
psychological, and financial burden to the parents. There
is also have indirect cost where scarce public resources
are utilized for long term care of the handicapped
premature child [7].
Primary prevention of preterm birth is always by
detection of the cause and the pathphsiological
mechanism of preterm birth therefore ; the early
detection of women at high risk of preterm delivery
could be the gold way to prevent preterm birth [8].
There are two sources of progesterone: Endogenous
progesterone which is gestational vital support steroid
hormone produced by the adrenal glands, corpus luteum
and placenta [9]. Exogenous progesterone has been used
to support assisted reproduction protocols, such as in
vitro fertilization [IVF], while progesterone receptor
antagonist such as mifepristone have Contraceptive and
abortificient effect [10].
Moreover, progesterone supplementation has been
reported to reduce the incidence of preterm delivery in
women at risk for premature labor [11].
2.Patients and Methods
This prospective, observational, cohort study was
conducted in Obstetrics and Gynaecology outpatient
clinic and departments of El-Bagour general hospital and
Benha University Hospital, during the period from June
2018 to June 2019.
Approval of the study was obtained from the Ethical
Committee of Scientific Research, Faculty of Medicine,
Benha University. Written informed consent was taken
from the patients enrolled in this study. 
The study included 100 cases of high risk pregnant
women admitted to the department and candidates for
progesterone therapy for possible preterm birth.
The study included patients with singleton pregnancy,
gestational age of pregnancy between 28 - 34 weeks,
pregnancies with history of previous one or more
spontaneous preterm labor and no serious maternal or
fetal problems
While loss of follow up, ruptured membranes.,
Multiple pregnancies., Symptoms of preterm labor,
Serious maternal or fetal problems, Placenta previa, fetal
congenital anomalies, Polyhydraminos, Any woman who
had to be delivered before term for medical or obstetric
indications were excluded from the study.

All participants were subjected to the following:-
History taking included: personal history, detailed
obstetric history, past history, family history. Estimation
of gestional age was calculated according to the date of
the last normal menstrual period and confirmed by first
trimester ultrasound. if there is adiscrepancy [ more than
five days ], early ultra sound will be used to determine
gestional age. General, obstetrics and abdominal
examination. CTG .Routine antenatal laboratory
investigations including [blood group, Rh typing, full
blood count and urine analysis ]. Routine obstetric
ultrasound scanning for gestional age, fetal biometry,
presentation, aminotic fluid volume, placental location
and exclusion of fetal anomalies [using 7-10MHZ??

2.1Statistical analysis
Recorded data were analyzed using the statistical
package for social sciences, version 20.0 [SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, Illinois, USA]. Quantitative data were
expressed as mean± standard deviation [SD]. Qualitative
data were expressed as frequency and percentage.
2.1.1The following tests were done
Independent-samples t-test of significance was used
when comparing between two means. Chi-square [
2
]
test of significance was used in order to compare
proportions between qualitative parameters. The
confidence interval was set to 95% and the margin of
error accepted was set to 5%. So, the p-value was
considered significant as the following: Probability [P￾value] P-value <0.05 was considered significant. P-value
<0.001 was considered as highly significant. P-value
>0.05 was considered insignificant.

4.Discussion
Every year, an estimated 15 million babies are born
preterm worldwide with rates ranging from 5% in several
European countries to 18% in some African countries In
2015, the preterm birth rate in the United States, which
was declined over 2007- 2014, increased slightly to
9.63% [12]
. Globally, preterm birth complications are the
leading cause of child mortality, and was responsible for
nearly 1 million deaths in 2013. In addition, surviving
preterm babies are at greater risk for short-term health
complications including acute respiratory,
gastrointestinal, infectious, central nervous system,
hearing, and vision problems. Long- term
neurodevelopmental disabilities such as cerebral palsy,
impaired learning and visual disorders, as well as chronic
diseases in adulthood are also recorded that [13].
There are many factors cause preterm labor either
Spontaneous [70%] as [Infection, Spontaneous rupture of
the membranes, Idiopathic contractions, Multiple
pregnancy, Cervical dysfunction, Antepartum
haemorrhage, Stress and Malnutrition] and Iatrogenic
[30%] as [Hypertension, Diabetes, Intrauterine growth
restriction] [14].
Progesterone has a role in maintaining pregnancy, by
suppression of the calcium–calmodulin–myosin light
chain kinase system. Additionally, progesterone has
recognized anti-inflammatory properties, raising a
possible link between inflammatory processes,
alterations in progesterone receptor expression and the
onset of preterm labor. Systematic reviews of
randomized controlled trials evaluating the use of
intramuscular and vaginal progesterone in women
considered to be at increased risk of preterm birth have
been published, with primary outcomes of preterm birth 
<34 weeks, perinatal death,and neurodevelopmental
handicap in childhood [15].
The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the
prophylactic administration of vaginal progesterone
would reduce the preterm birth rate in high-risk singleton
pregnancies.
The study will include 100 cases of high risk
pregnant women admitted to the department and
candidates for progesterone therapy for possible preterm
birth. Our patient characteristics were age [19-33] years,
mean cervical length [36 ± 0.7 mm] and mean
gestational age of previous preterm delivery [29.8±2.7
week].
This current results showed that the incidence of
preterm delivery in the Study Group was significantly
lower than that of the Control Group [38% versus 56%],
the postnatal morbidity was also significantly lower [6%
versus 15%] while the postnatal mortality was not
significantly different. Our results indicate that the
progesterone therapy significantly reduced the incidence
of preterm delivery.
The same results were reported by a previous study
by [16] Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine Publications
Committee (2012) reported that vaginal progesterone
administration was associated with a reduction in the risk
of admission to the neonatal intensive care unit [NICU],
respiratory distress syndrome [RDS], composite neonatal
morbidity and mortality in many studies.
Even with a shorter cervical length than we reported
in our study [mean was 36 mm in our study], vaginal
progesterone achieve a statically significant effect
difference between study group and control group
according to preterm labor. Data were available from 974
women in [17] study [498 assigned to vaginal
progesterone, 476 assigned to placebo] with a cervical

length ≤25 mm participating in five high-quality trials.
Vaginal progesterone was associated with a significant
reduction in the risk of preterm birth <33 weeks of
gestation [RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.47-0.81, P=0.0006; high￾quality evidence]. Moreover, vaginal progesterone
significantly decreased the risk of preterm birth <36,
<35, <34, <32, <30 and <28 weeks of gestation,
spontaneous preterm birth <33 and <34 weeks of
gestation, respiratory distress syndrome, composite
neonatal morbidity and mortality, birth weight <1500
and <2500 g, and admission to the neonatal intensive
care unit [RRs from 0.47 to 0.82; high-quality evidence
for all]. There were seven [1.4%] neonatal deaths in the
vaginal progesterone group and 15 [3.2%] in the placebo
group [RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.18-1.07, P=0.07; low-quality
evidence]. Maternal adverse events, congenital
anomalies, and adverse neurodevelopmental and health
outcomes at 2 years of age did not differ between groups.
A.Abdou et al. [18] showed that the administration of
vaginal suppository progesterone [200 mg, daily]
beginning at 20 - 24 wks of gestation and continued to 36
wks of gestation can significantly reduce the rate of
preterm birth before 37, 32 and 28 wks of gestation
among women with previous spontaneous preterm birth
specially in earlier gestational ages and increase the
mean birth weight. In addition, the rates of RDS and
admission to NICU were significantly decreased among
infants of women assigned to progesterone treatment.
Also, there was an additional benefit of vaginal
progesterone for prevention of preterm birth in women
who had prior spontaneous preterm birth and cervical
length < 25 mm. This result was in the same line with 
[19] where there was no statistically significant
difference between study group and control group
according to no. of previous preterm in women with This
was a multicenter, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐
controlled trial that enrolled asymptomatic women with a
singleton pregnancy and a sonographic short cervix [10–
20 mm] at 19 + 0 to 23 + 6 weeks of gestation.
In the opposite side, the findings of the OPPTIMUM
study ( 2016 )were reported. This was a randomized
controlled trial comparing vaginal progesterone versus
placebo in women at risk of preterm birth because of
previous spontaneous preterm birth <34 weeks of
gestation, or a cervical length ≤25 mm, or because of a
positive fetal fibronectin test combined with other
clinical risk factors for preterm birth. The results of that
trial showed that vaginal progesterone did not
significantly reduce the risk of preterm birth or perinatal
morbidity and mortality in the entire population, or in the
subgroup of women with a cervical length ≤25 mm. This
study clearly says that vaginal progesterone was not
associated with reduced risk of preterm birth or
composite neonatal adverse outcomes, and had no long￾term benefit or harm on outcomes in children at 2 years
of age [20].
In J. M. O’Brien et al. [21] found that prophylactic
treatment with vaginal progesterone did not reduce the
frequency of recurrent preterm birth [</= 32 weeks] in
women with a history of spontaneous preterm birth. The
effect of progesterone administration in patients at high
risk for preterm delivery as determined by methods other
than history alone [e.g. sonographic cervical length]
requires further investigation.
There was many different between study group
properties between this study and ours. This study group
age was [18-45] years old and the mean age of previous
preterm labor was only 19.9 weak. And that may explain
the difference of results between the two studies
E. B. Fonseca et al. [22] reported that progesterone
was associated with a not significant reduction in
neonatal morbidity [8.1% vs. 13.8%; relative risk, 0.59;
95% CI, 0.26 to 1.25; P=0.17]. There were no serious
adverse events associated with the use of progesterone.
This study discussed much more serious factors to
estimate fetal morbidity than in our study like [intra
ventricular hemorrhage,, retinopathy of prematurity, or
necrotizing enterocolitis] which isn’t included in our
study.
5.Conclusion
From this study we concluded that vaginal 
progesterone reduces the risk of PTB,NICU admission, 
RDS in singleton pregnancies at high-risk of preterm 
labour.
