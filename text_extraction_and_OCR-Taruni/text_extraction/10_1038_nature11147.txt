Human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) are highly polymorphic proteins
that initiate immunity by presenting pathogen-derived peptides to
T cells1
. HLA polymorphisms mostly map to the antigen-binding
cleft, thereby diversifying the repertoire of self-derived and pathogen￾derived peptide antigens selected by different HLA allotypes2
. A
growing number of immunologically based drug reactions, includ￾ing abacavir hypersensitivity syndrome (AHS) and carbamazepine￾induced Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS), are associated with
specific HLA alleles3–7. However,littleis known about the underlying
mechanisms of these associations, including AHS, a prototypical
HLA-associated drug reaction occurring exclusively in individuals
with the common histocompatibility alleleHLA-B*57:01, and with a
relative risk of more than 1,000 (refs 6, 7). We show that unmodified
abacavir binds non-covalently to HLA-B*57:01, lying across the
bottom of the antigen-binding cleft and reaching into the
F-pocket, where a carboxy-terminal tryptophan typically anchors
peptides bound to HLA-B*57:01. Abacavir binds with exquisite
specificity to HLA-B*57:01, changing the shape and chemistry of
the antigen-binding cleft, thereby altering the repertoire of
endogenous peptides that can bind HLA-B*57:01. In this way,
abacavir guides the selection of new endogenous peptides, inducing
a marked alteration in ‘immunological self’. The resultant peptide￾centric ‘altered self’ activates abacavir-specific T-cells, thereby
driving polyclonal CD8 T-cell activation and a systemic reaction
manifesting as AHS. We also show that carbamazepine, a widely
used anti-epileptic drug associated with hypersensitivity reactions
in HLA-B*15:02 individuals, binds to this allotype, producing
alterations in the repertoire of presented self peptides. Our findings
simultaneously highlight the importance of HLA polymorphism
in the evolution of pharmacogenomics and provide a general
mechanism for some of the growing number of HLA-linked hyper￾sensitivities that involve small-molecule drugs.
Abacavir (Supplementary Fig. 1) is a guanosine-related pro-drug
that causes reverse transcriptase chain termination in HIV-1 infec￾tion8
. T cells carrying the CD8 antigen (CD81 T cells) from patients
with resolved AHS, and from abacavir-naive, HLA-B*57:011 healthy
donors, proliferate and acquire effector functions in response to
abacavir in vitro8
. Moreover, abacavir-specific T cells are not activated
by antigen-presenting cells expressing the closely related natural
allotypes HLA-B*57:03 (Asp114Asn; Ser116Tyr), HLA-B*57:02
(Asp114Asn; Ser116Tyr; Leu156Arg) and HLA-B*58:01 (Met45Thr;
Ala46Glu; Val97Arg; Val103Leu)8
, suggesting that abacavir￾HLA-B*57:01 specificity is particularly sensitive to the F-pocket
architecture, namely residue 116.We examined the functional capacity
of the natural allotype HLA-B*57:11, which differs from HLA￾B*57:01 in the C/E pocket and environs (Ile94Thr; Ile95Leu;
Val97Trp) to stimulate abacavir-specific T cells. Like HLA-B*57:03,
HLA-B*57:02 and HLA-B*58:01 (ref. 8), HLA-B*57:11 was not func￾tional in activating abacavir-specific T cells from HLA-B*57:01 donors
(Fig. 1a), indicating that abacavir-HLA-B*57:01 specificity maps to the
C-terminal end of the antigen-binding cleft (C, D, E and F pockets).
We speculated that abacavir, or a metabolite thereof, might either
covalently modify a cellular protein or peptide to generate a novel
immunogenic ligand or alter the peptide repertoire in some other
way. Two of the most functionally important positions (114 and
116) controlling abacavir reactivity distinguish HLA-B*57:01 from
HLA-B*57:03 (ref. 8), allowing us to probe how these positions alter
the specificity of bound peptides and the impact of abacavir on the
peptide repertoire. We therefore characterized the peptides bound to
affinity-purified HLA-B*57:01 and HLA-B*57:03 molecules from
untreated and abacavir-treated cell lines by mass spectrometry9
. In
abacavir-treated cells, reverse-phase high-performance liquid chro￾matography fractions from purified HLA-B*57:01, but not HLA￾B*57:03, contained unmodified abacavir (Fig. 1b).Abacavir is a pro-drug,
but none of its metabolites were detected by liquid chromatography–
tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) analysis of the eluted
material. These findings indicated that abacavir itself interacted non￾covalently and specifically with HLA-B*57:01.
The repertoire of self peptides presented by HLA-B*57:01, HLA￾B*57:03 and HLA-B*58:01 in the presence and absence of abacavir
was examined further (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1). The
sequence motif characteristic of peptides that bind HLA-B*57:01
(ref. 10) was verified to contain a Ser/ThrRAla/Val at peptide posi￾tion 2 (P2) and a TrpRPhe at the C terminus of the peptide (PV)
(Supplementary Table 1). HLA-B*57:03 had the same P2 preference
as HLA-B*57:01, but the PV preference was reversed with PheRTrp
(Supplementary Table 1). After treatment of antigen-presenting cells
with abacavir we observed a change in the nature of the peptides bound
to HLA-B*57:01, but not for peptides bound to HLA-B*57:03 or HLA￾B*58:01 (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 1). This was characterized
by an increase in the number of HLA-B*57:01 ligands with non￾canonical Ile or Leu at PV (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 1). In
contrast, no change was detected in the preferred P2 residues selected
by HLA-B*57:01 (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 1) or the length of
peptides recovered (Fig. 2b–d). These novel peptides represented
about 20–25% of the recoverable peptide repertoire, indicating a
massive shift in self-antigen presentation (Fig. 2a, e), which was
consistent with the 33% estimated occupancy of HLA-B*57:01 com￾plexed with abacavir (Supplementary Table 2a). The impact of

(Fig. 2a) led us to propose that abacavir bound specifically to the
antigen-binding cleft of HLA-B*57:01. This is consistent with the
dependence of abacavir presentation on TAP (transporter associated
with antigen processing) and tapasin, implying a normal pathway of
peptide loading8
. This would result in a large proportion of the normal
repertoire of peptides being sterically hindered from binding to and
stabilizing HLA-B*57:01. The altered stereochemistry of the antigen￾binding cleft facilitates the binding of a new repertoire of peptides
containing immunogenic neo-epitopes. Consistent with this view,
HLA-B*57:01 bound to peptides (Supplementary Table 2b) contain￾ing a PV-Trp did not further stabilize recombinant HLA-B*57:01 in
the presence of abacavir. In contrast, for five of the neo-self peptides
eluted specifically in the presence of abacavir, the corresponding
refolded HLA-B*57:01–neo-self-peptide–abacavir complexes were
approximately 5–10 uC more thermostable than the corresponding
HLA-B*57:01–neo-self-peptide complexes (Supplementary Table 2b).
To test whether abacavir-specific T-cell reactivity was dependent on
simultaneous presentation of abacavir and novel self peptides, we first
established that T-cell-receptor (TCR) genes from a single abacavir￾specific T-cell clone, transfected into Jurkat cells, specifically conferred
reactivity to C1R-B*57:01 cells in the presence of abacavir (Supplemen￾tary Fig. 2a). Second, we examined the abacavir-specific T-cell response
towards five neo-self peptides exclusively identified from HLA-B*57:01
complexes isolated from abacavir-treated cells. T-cell lines were raised
from two different healthy HLA-B*57:011 donors and interferon-c
(IFN-c) enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assays were
conducted using C1R-B*57:01 and T2-B*57:01 target cells with or
without pretreatment with abacavir (Supplementary Fig. 2b). The addi￾tion of abacavir to T2-B*57:01 cells without the exogenous peptides
did not activate T-cell clones. In contrast, the five pooled abacavir￾dependent peptides added exogenously to the T2-B*57:01 cells in the
presence of abacavir activated many T-cell clones (spot-forming
units) in each of the two T-cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 2b). This
data shows that self peptides bound to HLA-B*57:01 in the presence of
abacavir specifically stimulate abacavir-responsive T cells. Thus, the
selection of a novel HLA-B*57:01-peptide repertoire by abacavir
exposes the normally self-tolerant T-cell compartment to previously
unseen neo-self peptides resembling antigen presentation by
allogeneic HLA molecules to T cells, as occurs in graft rejection11
and graft-versus-host disease12. In these circumstances a diverse
repertoire of ab TCRs may be selected by responding T cells, reflecting
reactivity towards the diverse array of novel self peptides bound to
HLA-B*57:01. To test this hypothesis we examined the Vb repertoire
of the TCRs selected by abacavir-specific T cells in seven unrelated
HLA-B*57:011 donors. Broadly polyclonal TCR usage (in which
different T cell clones undergo expansion in response to abacavir)
was observed in all donors (Fig. 3). In addition, for donors 6 and 7
the T-cell repertoire was assessed before and after stimulation with
abacavir, revealing modest ‘private’ biases in immune repertoire
that differed between these donors (Fig. 3; compare Vb2 with Vb8
in these donors before and after stimulation). Moreover, analysis of
the antigen-binding complementarity-determining region 3 sequences
in abacavir-specific TCRs did not reveal biased patterns (Supplemen￾tary Table 3). TCR selection was therefore consistent with the diverse
array of stimulating ligands in abacavir-treated cells, with no evidence
of TCR bias as frequently observed in T-cell responses to single, novel
ligands13. This observation is distinct from the reported sharing of a
narrow repertoire of drug-specific T cells reactive in HLA-B*15:021

patients with carbamazepine-induced SJS or toxic epidermal necrolysis
(TEN)14. The abacavir-specific, polyclonal TCR usage is consistent
with the presentation of diverse neo-self peptides as a result of drug￾induced ‘altered self’.
Next we individually expressed and refolded HLA-B*57:01 in
complex with two self peptides (LTTKLTNTNI, ‘LTTK’, cytochrome c
oxidase subunit 2; RVAQLEQVYI, ‘RVAQ’, small nuclear ribonucleo￾protein Sm D3) that had been exclusively isolated from HLA-B*57:01
in the presence of abacavir and both of which possessed the preferred
PV residue, Ile, common in neo-peptides eluted in the presence of
abacavir. Indeed, HLA-B*57:01 refolded extremely poorly with these
self peptides in the absence of abacavir, which is consistent with the
altered binding motif revealed by the peptide elution data. We crystal￾lized the HLA-B*57:01–LTTK–abacavir and HLA-B*57:01–RVAQ–
abacavir complexes and determined their structures to 1.9 A˚ and 1.6 A˚
resolution, respectively (Supplementary Table 4). The structure of the
HLA-B*57:01–LTTK–abacavir complex was very similar to that of the
HLA-B*57:01–RVAQ–abacavir complex (Supplementary Fig. 3a),
revealing that the mode of abacavir binding is conserved when
disparate abacavir-specific self peptides are presented by HLA￾B*57:01. The HLA-B*57:01–LTTK–abacavir complex closely resembled
the structure of the previously reported complex of HLA-B*57:01 with
the self peptide LSSPVTKSF (ref. 8). Thus, the presence of abacavir,
which was unambiguously observed to be non-covalently bound
within the antigen-binding cleft (Fig. 4a, b), did not markedly alter
the conformation of the antigen-binding cleft itself. Moreover, the
conformation of the bound peptide, although not sitting as deep within
the antigen-binding cleft as the LTTK self peptide, nevertheless
adopted a slightly bulged conformation that was reminiscent of how
longer major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I peptides
(more than 10 residues long)15 can bind within the antigen-binding
cleft (Fig. 4b).
Within the HLA-B*57:01–LTTK–abacavir and HLA-B*57:01–
RVAQ–abacavir complexes, abacavir was bound in an extended
manner, at the base of the antigen-binding cleft, in which the plane
of the aromatic rings were positioned approximately diagonally across
the cleft’s b-sheet, with the cyclopentyl and purinyl moieties located in
the D and E pockets, respectively, while the cyclopropyl moiety
extended towards, and protruded into, the F pocket (Fig. 4c–e). The
binding of abacavir did not impinge on the B pocket, which is consist￾ent with the unchanged anchor preference at this site in abacavir￾treated cells (Fig. 2a). However, the conformation of abacavir within
the cleft provided a basis for understanding the global peptide
repertoire shift induced by the drug, in that abacavir resided within
several HLA-B*57:01 binding pockets (C, D, E and F), thereby affecting
the nature of the peptides bound. For example, P7-Lys of the conven￾tional LSSPVTKSF self peptide bound in the absence of abacavir would
clash with the cyclopentyl and purinyl moieties of abacavir (Fig. 4f).
Abacavir made extensive contacts with the HLA molecule (buried
surface area 450 A˚ 2
), forming numerous van der Waals contacts, five
hydrogen bonds and three water-mediated hydrogen bonds, yet made
few contacts with the self peptides bound within the cleft, with direct
abacavir–peptide contacts being limited to P3-Thr, P5-Leu and P10-Ile
for the LTTK complex and to the P10-Ile in the RVAQ complex
(Fig. 4c, e). Abacavir was completely buried within the antigen-binding
cleft of HLA-B*57:01–LTTK, with the peptide accounting for only
24% of the buried surface area; the HLA-B*57:01 contributed to bury￾ing the remaining 76% of abacavir’s surface area. The extensive con￾tacts made by HLA-B*57:01 and the three moieties of abacavir
(Fig. 4c–e and Supplementary Fig. 1) provided a basis for understand￾ing why only abacavir, and not its closely related metabolites (such as
carbovir), was specifically bound within the antigen-binding cleft: the
abacavir metabolites are likely to have a much reduced affinity for
HLA-B*57:01. Specifically, the cyclopentyl moiety of abacavir nestled
against Tyr 99 (Fig. 4c), in which the O1 moiety hydrogen-bonded to
Tyr 74-OH (Fig. 4d), whereas the purinyl moiety of abacavir was
flanked by aromatic residues Tyr 74 and Trp 147, as well as forming
van der Waals contacts with Val 97, Ser 116 and Ile 124 (Fig. 4d).

Moreover, the N4 group of the purinyl moiety hydrogen-bonded to
Asp 114, and the N1 and N2 groups hydrogen-bonded to Ser 116
(Fig. 4d). The cyclopropyl moiety, which resided within the
F pocket, packed against Ser 116 and Tyr 123 and additionally formed
van der Waals contacts with Ile 95. The presence of the cyclopropyl
group within the F pocket would disfavour the presence of larger
amino-acid side chains at the PV position (Fig. 4e), thereby providing
a basis for understanding why the presence of abacavir induces a
preference for smaller residues at PV (Fig. 4f).
The structure of the HLA-B*57:01–LTTK–abacavir complex also
provided a basis for understanding the impact of HLA micropoly￾morphism on abacavir specificity (Fig. 4f) and our observation of
abacavir co-purification only with HLA-B*57:01 (Fig. 1b). For
example, abacavir cannot bind HLA-B*58:01, because the poly￾morphic position 97 (HLA-B*57:01 Val97Arg HLA-B*58:01) sat
directly beneath, and contacted abacavir such that the presence of
the long charged side chain of Arg 97 in HLA-B*58:01 would disfavour
abacavir binding (Fig. 4f). Moreover, in HLA-B*57:02 and HLA￾B*57:03, the replacement of Ser 116 at the base of the F pocket with
the more bulky Tyr 116 residue would prevent abacavir from binding
these allotypes, because the central purine group would not be accom￾modated (Fig. 4f). Indeed, when the HLA-B*57:01–abacavir contact
sites are mapped against the HLA sequence database (http://www.
ebi.ac.uk/imgt/hla/), it is evident that the constellation of contact
residues is unique to HLA-B*57:01, thereby providing a basis for the
exquisite specificity of abacavir towards this HLA allomorph. These
findings help explain the low prevalence of AHS in African Americans
who have relatively high frequencies of HLA-B*58:01, HLA-B*57:02
and HLA-B*57:03, and in whom the frequency of HLA-B*57:01 is
lower than in Europe16. The penetrance of AHS in HLA-B*57:011
individuals is about 50%, indicating that additional factors determine
whether abacavir treatment induces AHS17. It is unclear whether these
cofactors are genetic18 or are related to environmental factors such as
drug dose. Either way, the basic mechanism involves specific co￾occupancy of the HLA-B*57:01 antigen-binding cleft by abacavir
and novel self peptides presenting a new ‘immunological self’ to host
T cells.
Next we sought to establish the likely generality of our HLA–
abacavir-associated observations, and focused on carbamazepine
(CBZ) (Supplementary Fig. 4a–e). A strong HLA association is well
established between HLA-B*15:02 and CBZ-induced SJS/TEN in
Asian populations with odds ratios of more than 1,000 (refs 3, 4, 14).
We first established that a non-covalent association existed between
CBZ and HLA-B*15:02 by purifying HLA-B*15:02 peptide complexes
from CBZ-treated cells (Supplementary Fig. 4). Second, sequencing of
peptides bound to HLA-B*15:02 in the presence of CBZ revealed a

shift in the preferred amino-acid side-chain selection with an increase
in the hydrophobicity at several positions and a preference for smaller
residues at the P4 and P6 positions, but no shift in anchor residue
preference (P2 and PV) (Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary
Table 5a, b). The magnitude of the CBZ-induced repertoire shift, about
15%, was smaller than that observed for abacavir. This was predicted,
because CBZ is likely to bind at secondary anchor sites in HLA￾B*15:02, adjacent to position 156. This is based on the observation
that the closely related allele,HLA-B*15:01, is not associated with CBZ￾induced SJS, and a notable non-conservative difference between these
two allomorphs is at position 156 (Leu, HLA-B*15:02; Trp HLA￾B*15:01). The small shift in peptide repertoire might explain the
restricted TCR usage against drug-specific T cells reactive in HLA￾B*15:021 patients with CBZ-induced SJS. Furthermore, automated
in silico docking of CBZ into the cleft of HLA-B*15:02 predicted that
CBZ binds underneath the P4/P6 residues of the peptide, adjacent to
position 156 in HLA-B*15:02 (Supplementary Fig. 4c–e). Taken
together, these observations for CBZ-HLA-B*15:02 peptide complexes
resonated with those for abacavir–HLA-B*57:01, suggesting a general
mechanism for hypersensitivity reactions towards at least two
commonly used drugs with known HLA associations.
It is well established that HLA molecules can bind peptide ligands;
our findings show that small-molecule drugs can specifically and non￾covalently interact with defined HLA class I molecules, and subse￾quently alter peptide repertoire in a clinical context (Supplementary
Fig. 5). These findings suggest that HLA molecules, and most probably
other antigen-presenting molecules, may be surprisingly susceptible to
drug modulation of antigen selection that in turn induces altered T-cell
immunity. Although the observed mechanism is unlikely to account
for all HLA-associated drug associations, our observations provide a
potential basis for illuminating other HLA-linked drug hypersensitivities
such as the very strong link between HLA-B*58:01 and allopurinol
hypersensitivity syndrome19. Indeed, the extensive polymorphism of
HLA molecules, the similarity of small-molecule drugs possessing ring
structures (Supplementary Fig. 1) and the plethora of different drug
hypersensitivities make it likely that this is a general mechanism. In this
regard, the capacity of small molecular moieties to modulate immuno￾logical self could have implications for understanding the origins of
autoimmunity.
METHODS SUMMARY
T-cell assays. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from healthy blood
donors were from the Australian Bone Marrow Donor Registry and Australian
Red Cross Blood Bank. Stimulation with abacavir and cytokine assays have been
described previously8
.
Peptide repertoire analyses. HLA–peptide complexes were immunoaffinity puri￾fied using solid-phase-boundW6/32monoclonal antibody20 and analysed essentially
as described9
.
Jurkat-transfection and activation assay. An abacavir-responsive T-cell clone
(ABC12.20) was cloned into a retroviral vector (pMIG) and transduced into the
Jurkat cell line. Activation was measured as the mean fluorescence intensity of
staining for the early activation marker CD69.
ELISPOT assays. IFN-c ELISPOT assays were performed using cytokine capture
and detection reagents in accordance with the instructions of the manufacturer
(Mabtech).
HLA-B*57:01 expression, refolding and purification. The peptides LTTKLTNTNI
(cytochrome c oxidase subunit 2) and RVAQLEQVYI (small nuclear ribonucleo￾protein Sm D3) were refolded with HLA-B*57:01 and abacavir and purified as
described previously21.
Thermal stability assays. These were conducted on pHLA-B*57:01 samples
(6abacavir) with the fluorescent dye Sypro orange in the Real Time Detection
system (Corbett RotorGene 3000), to monitor protein unfolding.
In silico docking. Computational docking was performed to probe the binding of
carbamazepine into HLA-B*15:02.
Crystallization and data collection. The HLA-B*57:01–LTTK–abacavir and
HLA-B*57:01–RVAQ–abacavir complexes were crystallized and their structures
were determined.

METHODS
Blood samples from HLA-B*57:011 donors. Samples from healthy blood
donors were from the Australian Bone Marrow Donor Registry and Australian
Red Cross Blood Bank. Institutional ethics approvals were obtained for use of all
clinical material. DNA sequencing to obtain four-digit high-resolution genotyping
of class I alleles at the HLA-A and B loci were performed for each donor (Victorian
Transplantation and Immunogenetics Service, Victoria, Australia).
Cell culture and cell lines. Cells from the class-I-deficient lymphoblastoid cell line,
C1R22,23, transfected with the relevant HLA allele were used as stimulators for
functional assays and as a source of peptide for peptide elutions. Cells were main￾tained in RF-10 medium (RPMI (Gibco BRL) supplemented with 10% fetal calf
serum (Bovogen), 7.5 mM HEPES (MP Biomedicals), 150 mg ml21 streptomycin
(Sigma), 150 U ml21 benzylpenicillin (CSL), 2 mM L-glutamine (MP Biomedicals),
76 mM b-mercaptoethanolamine (Sigma) and 150 mM non-essential amino acids
(Gibco BRL)). Treatment of cells with abacavir (Ziagen tablets; Glaxo Smith Kline)
for peptide elutions was performed at 10 mg ml21 in RF-10 for 10 days in roller
bottle culture. Cells were pelleted, washed twice in PBS and snap-frozen on solid
CO2.
Purification of MHC-peptide complexes. Cell pellets were ground in a Retsch
Mixer Mill MM 400 under cryogenic conditions, resuspended in 0.5% IGEPAL,
50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and protease inhibitors (Complete
Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablet; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at a density
of 5 3 107 cells ml21 and incubated for 1 h at 4 uC. Lysates were cleared by ultra￾centrifugation (180,000g) and HLA-peptide complexes immunoaffinity purified
using solid-phase-boundW6/32 monoclonal antibody as described23. Bound com￾plexes were eluted by acidification with 10% acetic acid. The mixture of peptides,
class I heavy chain and b2-microglobulin was fractionated on a 4.6-mm internal
diameter 3 50-mm long monolithic C18 reverse-phase high-performance liquid
chromatography column (Chromolith Speed Rod; Merck) using an A¨KTAmicro
HPLC system (GE Healthcare), with a mobile phase consisting of buffer A (0.1%
trifluoroacetic acid) and buffer B (80% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid).
Identification of MHC-bound peptides using LC–MS/MS. Peptide-containing
fractions were concentrated and loaded onto a microfluidic trap column packed
with ChromXP C18-CL 3-mm particles (300 A˚ nominal pore size; equilibrated in
0.1% formic acid/5% acetonitrile) at 5 ml min21 using an Eksigent NanoUltra
cHiPLC system. An analytical (15 cm3 75 mm ChromXP C18-CL 3) microfluidic
column was then switched in line and peptides separated by linear gradient elution
of 0–80% acetonitrile over 90 min (300 nl min21
). Separated peptides were
analysed with an AB SCIEX 5600 TripleTOF mass spectrometer equipped with
a Nanospray III ion source and accumulating up to 30 MS/MS spectra per second.
Collectively, sequence determination of up to about 3,000 peptides was conducted
in three independent experiments, providing excellent technical replicates and
average sampling of over 80% in each of the triplicate biological replicate experi￾ments. Data were analysed with ProteinPilot software and peptide identities were
determined subject to strict bioinformatic criteria that included the use of a decoy
database to calculate the false discovery rate (FDR). A FDR cutoff of 5% was
applied and the filtered data set wasfurther analysed manually to exclude redundant
peptides and known contaminants. Comparisons between data sets were performed
to thefollowing criteria:first, peptides were considered common between data sets if
they appeared in at least one data set with confidence greater than the threshold for a
5% FDR for that data set, regardless of the confidence in the second data set; second,
peptides were considered unique to a data set if they appeared in that data set with a
confidence greater than the thresholdfor a 5% FDR, but did not appear in compared
data set with confidence score greater than 20.
ELISPOT assays. IFN-c ELISPOT assays were performed with cytokine capture
and detection reagents in accordance with the instructions of the manufacturer
(Mabtech). In brief, anti-IFN-c antibodies were coated on the wells of a 96-well
nitrocellulose plate, and duplicate wells were seeded with 60,000 target antigen￾presenting cells and/or 50,000 bulk culture effector T cells per well. APCs were
incubated overnight with abacavir (10 mg ml21
) and then washed three times.
APCs were then incubated with peptide for 1 h at 10 mM and then washed three
times. After incubation for 16 h, captured IFN-c was detected with a biotinylated
anti-IFN-c antibody, followed by development with streptavidin horseradish per￾oxidase complex and chromogenic substrate. Spots were counted with an auto￾mated plate counter (AID).
Drug-specific lymphocyte culture, stimulation and Vb characterization.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from human whole blood or
buffy coats within 24 h of collection, using Ficoll-Hypaque density centrifugation
and abacavir-responsive T-cell lines established as described previously8
. After 11–
14 days of culture, T-cell lines were re-stimulated at a 10:1 responder:stimulator
ratio with abacavir-treated (4–16 h at 10 mg ml21 in RF-10) and irradiated
(8,000 rad) C1R-B*57:01 cells that had been washed three times in RPMI. This
was repeated weekly for the lifetime of the culture. After 3–4 weeks of culture,
abacavir-responsive T cells were identified on re-stimulation with abacavir-treated
C1R-B*57:01, using intracellular cytokine staining for IFN-c as described previ￾ously8
. Cells were phenotyped by staining with a anti-CD8 PerCP (BD
Biosciences) and either anti-CD3 PE-Cy7 (eBioscience) or a panel of antibodies
specific for a range of TCR Vb (Beckman Coulter). Flow cytometry and FlowJo
software (Tree Star Incorporated) were used to calculate the proportion of the
abacavir-specific (CD81/IFN-c1) lymphocyte population expressing each Vb.
HLA-B*57:01 expression, refolding and purification. The peptides
LTTKLTNTNI and RVAQLEQVYI were synthesized by GenScript USA Inc.
Mature cDNA sequences of HLA-B*57:01 and b2-microglobulin were ligated into
the bacterial expression vector, pET, and recombinant protein was expressed in
the BL21 strain of Escherichia coli as described previously8,21. HLA-B*57:01
(28 mg), b2-microglobulin (14 mg) and peptide (4 mg) were refolded in the pres￾ence or absence of 60 mM abacavir in 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.4 M arginine,
0.5 mM oxidized glutathione, 1.5 mM reduced glutathione, 2 mM EDTA, 4 M
urea, 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride in a volume of 200 ml over a 24-h
period at 4 uC. The refolded protein was then dialysed for 4 h against 0.1 M urea,
10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, and overnight against 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 at
4 uC using a 6–8-kDa molecular mass cut-off dialysis membrane (Spectrum).
Protein was purified with fast protein liquid chromatography as described
previously21.
Crystallization and data collection. The HLA-B*57:01–LTTK–abacavir and
HLA-B*57:01–RVAQ–abacavir complexes were concentrated to 4 mg ml21 in
10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0. Crystals were obtained at 294 K by the hanging-drop
vapour-diffusion method from a solution comprising 28% PEG 8000, 0.2 M
ammonium sulphate and 0.1 M cacodylate pH 6.25. The crystals grew to dimen￾sions 0.1 mm3 0.1 mm 3 0.1 mm in 4 days. Before data collection, the crystals
were equilibrated in crystallization solution with 10% glycerol added as a
cryoprotectant, and then flash-cooled in a stream of liquid nitrogen at 100 K.
X-ray diffraction data were recorded on a Quantum-315 charge-coupled device
detector at the MX2 beamline of the Australian Synchrotron. The data were
integrated and scaled with MOSFLM and SCALA from the CCP4 program suite.
Details of the data processing statistics are given in Supplementary Table 4.
Structure determination and refinement. The HLA-B*57:01–LTTK–abacavir
structure was determined by molecular replacement as implemented in PHASER.
The search model used was the structure of HLA-B*57:01 with the peptide
removed (PDB accession code 2RFX). The LTTKLTNTNI peptide and a single
abacavir molecule were built manually. Refinement of the model was performed in
PHENIX with iterative rounds of manual building in COOT. Solvent molecules
were added with COOT and the structure validated with MOLPROBITY. The
final structure comprises one HLA-B*57:01–LTTK–abacavir complex in the
asymmetric unit. The HLA-B*57:01–RVAQ–abacavir complex was solved using
the HLA-B*57:01–LTTK–abacavir complex (minus the peptide and abacavir) as
the starting point in refinement. The final refinement values are summarized in
Supplementary Table 4.
Thermal stability assay. To assess the effect of the abacavir on the HLA-B*5701
stability, a thermal shift assay was performed. The fluorescent dye Sypro orange
was used to monitor the protein unfolding. The thermal stability assay was per￾formed in the Real Time Detection system (Corbett RotorGene 3000), originally
designed for PCR. Each peptide was refolded at two concentrations (5 and 10 mM)
in duplicate in the absence or presence of abacavir with HLA-B*57:01 in 10 mM
Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl. Refolded complexes were heated from 29 uC to
90 uC at a heating rate of 1 uC min21
. The fluorescence intensity was measured with
excitation at 530 nm and emission at 555 nm.
In silico docking. Computational docking was performed to probe the binding of
abacavir into HLA-B*57:01 and carbamazepine into HLA-B*15:02. Two￾dimensional representations of the compounds were sketched in the
JMEMolecularEditor and converted to three-dimensional coordinates in
ProDrg24. AutoDock Tools 1.5.4 (ref. 25) was then used to assign hydrogens,
Gasteiger charges and rotatable bonds to the compounds. Each docking run was
done in the absence of peptide within the binding cleft. The docking of ligands into
their respective HLA peptide-binding clefts was performed with the AutoDock
Vina software25. A docking grid with dimensions 42 A˚ 3 42 A˚ 3 42 A˚, encompass￾ing the entire peptide-binding cleft, was used.
Abacavir. The in silico docking runs with abacavir resulted in the placement of the
drug with remarkable fidelity to what is observed in the crystal structure. The
resultant placements of the drug are all clustered within the F pocket
(Supplementary Fig. 3b). This placement was not directed, in that the entire
peptide-binding groove was probed, and was not spatially constrained by the
presence of peptide. The two predominant docking modes bound with docking
scores (DG) of 29.5 and 28.0 kcal mol21
, which are related by an approximately
180u rotation about the central 2-aminopurine moiety. The primary placement is
oriented as observed in the crystal structure, with an root mean squared deviation

of 0.6 A˚ over all atoms, and preserves the contacts between the 2-aminopurine and
cyclopropane moieties and the HLA-B*57:01 (Supplementary Fig. 3b), thereby
validating the auto-docking procedure.
Carbamazepine. Because the crystal structure of HLA-B*15:02 is unavailable, it was
homology modelled from the crystal structure of the closely related HLA-B*15:01
(PDB code 1XR9 (ref. 26)) (only four positions differ between these two allomorphs
(HLA-B*15:01RHLA-B*15:02: Glu63Asn, Thr94Ile, Leu95Ile, His113Tyr, Trp156Leu).
The computational docking of carbamazepine resulted in the exclusive clustering
of the drug within the D pocket of HLA-B*15:02 (Supplementary Fig. 4c). The
primary orientation bound with a docking score (DG) of 27.6 kcal mol21
. The
pocket is lined with predominantly hydrophobic residues, with carbamazempine
binding the side chains of residues Tyr 9, Tyr 99, Ile 66, Leu 156 and Tyr 159,
the aliphatic moiety of 97 and the guanidinium group of Arg 62 (Supplementary
Fig. 4d, e).
Generation and activation of the ABC12.20.Jurkat cell line. An abacavir￾responsive T-cell clone was isolated by single-cell sorting of abacavir-responsive
T cells identified with an IFN-c cytokine secretion assay (Miltenyi Biotech). RNA
was isolated from the outgrown clonal population, and the cDNA sequences of the
TCR a and b were sequenced and identified as TRAV12-3*01-TRAJ26*01 and
TRBV20-1-TRBJ2-2*01-TRBC2 using 59-rapid amplification of cDNA ends.
Full-length cDNA ABC12.20 a and b chains were cloned into a self-cleaving 2A
peptide-based MSCV–IRES–green fluorescent protein retroviral vector (pMIG)27
and transduced into the Jurkat cell line (which had been similarly transduced with
genes encoding CD8ab) using the murine stem cell virus (MSCV)-based retroviral
expression system, as developed by Clontech Laboratories by means of 293T
packaging cells. Cell activation was assessed after co-incubation of Jurkat cells
with target APCs for 6–7 h at a 1:2 Jurkat:APC ratio in RF10. The TCR-positive
Jurkat cells were identified by positive GFP fluorescence and immunofluorescence
staining for CD3 and their activation was assessed as mean fluorescence intensity
of the early activation marker CD69.
