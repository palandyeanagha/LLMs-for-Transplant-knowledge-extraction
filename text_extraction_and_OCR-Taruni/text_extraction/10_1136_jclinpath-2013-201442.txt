ABSTRACT
Pulmonary fibrosis in surgical lung biopsies is said to
have a ‘usual interstitial pneumonia-pattern’
(UIP-pattern) of disease when scarring of the
parenchyma is present in a patchy, ‘temporally
heterogeneous’ distribution. These biopsies are one of
the more common non-neoplastic specimens surgical
pathologists encounter and often pose a number of
challenges. UIP is the expected histopathological pattern
in patients with clinical idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
(IPF), but the UIP-pattern can be seen in other
conditions on occasion. Most important among these are
the rheumatic interstitial lung diseases (RILD) and
chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (CHrHP). Because
theses entities have different mechanisms of injury,
approach to therapy, and expected clinical progression, it
is imperative for the surgical pathologist to correctly
classify them. Taken in isolation, the UIP-pattern seen in
patients with IPF may appear to overlap with that of
RILD and CHrHP, at least when using the broadest
definition of this term (patchy fibrosis). However,
important distinguishing features are nearly always
present in our experience, and the addition of a
multidisciplinary approach will often resolve the critical
differences between these diseases. In this manuscript,
we review the distinguishing clinical, radiologic and
histopathological features of UIP of IPF, RILD and CHrHP,
based, in part, on the existing literature, but also lessons
learned from a busy lung biopsy consultation practice.
INTRODUCTION
The diffuse parenchymal lung diseases (commonly
referred to as ‘interstitial lung diseases’ or ‘ILDs’)
include a heterogeneous group of mainly non￾neoplastic disorders. ILDs are mostly inflammatory
in nature and the resulting injury to the lung paren￾chyma can lead to fibrosis and eventual honeycomb
cystic remodelling. Some ILDs are characterised by
the presence of fibrosis. Dominant among these is
‘usual interstitial pneumonia’ (UIP) which is the
most common histopathological form of diffuse
lung fibrosis occurring in older adults, first described
by Liebow in 1969.1 According to Liebow, UIP was
idiopathic in about half the affected patients, and
the idiopathic form of UIP was referred to clinically
as ‘idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis’ (IPF). The other
half of UIP patients had other causes of diffuse lung
fibrosis. The common use of the term UIP by pathol￾ogists to describe diffuse fibrosis is often confusing
to clinicians who tend to assume that a pathological
designation of UIP denotes a diagnosis of IPF, not
realising that some forms of the UIP-pattern of
advanced fibrosis can have other aetiologies. Our
goal in this review is to shed light on the multidis￾ciplinary clues that are most helpful in distinguish￾ing those forms of UIP that are manifestations of
pulmonary fibrosis from other causes.
From a histopathological perspective, the
UIP-pattern of fibrosis is characterised by two key
features:
▸ Spatial or geographic heterogeneity which
refers to a patchy distribution of dense paren￾chymal scar alternating with areas of less
affected or normal parenchyma (figure 1A).
▸ Temporal heterogeneity which refers to areas of
densely collagenised fibrosis (the past) with
variable smooth muscle proliferation (‘old’

heterogeneity is seen at scanning magnification (A, 20×, H&E). Large conglomerate zones of pulmonary fibrosis (at
the pleural surface and lower right) alternate with areas of uninvolved parenchyma (lower left). At higher
magnification (B, 200×, H&E), the temporal heterogeneity of this active fibrosing process is appreciated by identifying
immature fibrosis in the form of fibroblast foci (arrow).

fibrosis) alternating with active fibroblast foci (‘new’ fibrosis;
the present). Importantly, the UIP-pattern biopsy must also
have the ‘future’, with normal lung evident (figure 1B).
These features provide the minimal diagnostic criteria for inclu￾sion into the UIP-pattern of disease. However, histopathological
clues to the aetiology of pulmonary fibrosis reside first in recognis￾ing the pattern and distribution of chronic parenchymal damage,
and then determining the cellular elements involved in the process.
For example, fibrotic parenchymal diseases with upper lung zone
predominance implicate an inhalational injury, as does airway￾centred scarring seen under the microscope, while fibrosis that
begins at the periphery of the lung bases tends to occur in diseases
thought to have a systemic immunologic mechanism of injury such
as rheumatic disease (RD). An upper lobe distribution of hyaline
fibrosis accompanied by small non-necrotising granulomas along
lung lymphatic routes is characteristic of sarcoidosis, whereas an
upper and mid-lobe inflammatory disease with tiny interstitial
granulomas centred on the airways, defines subacute hypersensitiv￾ity pneumonitis (HP). Unfortunately, overlaps occur, so the only
consistent and reliable approach to these diseases when fibrosis is
the dominant element requires a clinical, radiological and histo￾pathological approach.
The three most common diseases that present with advanced
pulmonary fibrosis having a UIP-pattern are IPF, rheumatic ILD
(RILD), and chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (CHrHP).
The key clinical, radiographic and histopathological differences
that help distinguish these three manifestations of pulmonary
fibrosis are presented.
USUAL INTERSTITIAL PNEUMONIA OF IPF
Definition
IPF is a specific form of chronic, progressive fibrosis, confined to
the lungs and of unknown cause.2 It occurs primarily in older
male patients, and is associated with the histopathological and
radiological patterns of ‘UIP’.
2 3 The definition of IPF requires
exclusion of other forms of interstitial pneumonia as well as ILDs
associated with environmental exposure, drugs or systemic
disease.2 3 The distinguishing clinical, radiological and histopatho￾logical features are discussed below and highlighted in table 1.
Distinguishing clinical features
The presenting symptoms are dominated by gradual onset of
exertional dyspnoea, sometimes associated with chronic cough.
IPF is associated commonly with a history of smoking.4 The chief
physical examination characteristic at auscultation is dry crackles
at the lung bases (so-called ‘Velcro rales’). Clubbing of the fingers
occurs in approximately 40–75% of patients, and it appears to
occur in IPF more commonly than in other ILDs.5 There should
be no chronic occupational or environmental exposure, clinical
evidence of connective tissue disease, such as rheumatoid arth￾ritis (RA) or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), or history of
drug exposure known to cause ILD (nitrofurantoin, methotrex￾ate, cyclophosphamide, or any of a variety of chemotherapeutic
drugs).2

Distinguishing radiological features
The typical radiological pattern of UIP of IPF is heterogenous fibro￾sis in spatial (normal lung interspersed among areas of fibrosis) and
temporal distribution (fibrosis in different stages of evolution). The
diagnostic radiological pattern of UIP requires honeycombing with
a peripheral predominant, lower lobe, non-segmental distribution
(apico-basilar gradient) (figure 2A).6 The upper lobes are involved
to a lesser degree, and traction bronchiectasis may be present. The
classic pattern of UIP of IPF on CT is diagnostic and biopsy is not
warranted if it fulfils these imaging patterns.2
UIP of IPF may also be suggested without CT honeycombing
when heterogenous fibrosis is identified in an appropriate clin￾ical setting; lobular distortion is worst in lower lobes, and upper
lobe non-segmental involvement is present (figure 2B).7
‘Microscopic honeycombing’ may be seen in biopsies from these
latter patients, presumably as an early manifestation of the
macroscopic cysts seen on imaging. Ground-glass abnormalities,
if present, are typically limited in extent and restricted to basilar
subpleural areas of fibrosis, unless patients present during an
acute flare of the disease (so-called ‘acute exacerbation of IPF’).8
Distinguishing histopathological features
In UIP of IPF, the distribution of fibrosis tends to be subpleural and
paraseptal (figure 3A). Scattered foci of immature fibrosis
(so-called ‘fibroblast foci’) are found at the interface between
fibrotic and normal parenchyma (figure 3B) as a ‘bulge’ from the
interstitium. These foci must be distinguished from fibroblastic
alveolar plugs of organising pneumonia. A true fibroblastic focus
should be interstitial-based and never a formed polypoid intrusion
into the alveolar space. These active ‘new’ areas of fibrosis coexist
with the dense ‘old’ collagen deposition and provide the basis of
‘temporal heterogeneity’ in UIP. Smooth muscle is commonly
prominent within areas of advanced confluent fibrosis (figure 3C),
especially in subpleural scar. Areas of microscopic honeycomb
remodelling (MHR) are present in the vast majority of cases
(figure 3D), even in the absence of diagnostic honeycomb cysts on
high-resolution CT imaging. These areas likely represent com￾pletely destroyed lung lobules devoid of alveoli and characterised
by aggregates of small cystic spaces containing mucous. These
microcysts are consistently lined by ciliated respiratory epithelium
attesting to their terminal airway derivation. Fibrosis surrounds
MHR at least on three sides, a helpful feature in distinguishing
MHR from more common chronic small airway injury lesions of
‘peribronchiolar metaplasia’ (PBM) where respiratory epithelium
extends along alveolar ducts in a limited fashion without well￾formed cysts. A small amount of chronic inflammation may attend
these, but is not expected away from honeycomb remodelling in
fibrosis or in any preserved alveolar walls.

respiratory causes.10 11 The most frequent RDs associated with
pleural and pulmonary manifestation are: RA, SLE, progressive
systemic sclerosis, polymyositis/dermatomyositis and Sjögren
syndrome. RA is the most common form of RD worldwide, and
by sheer numbers is second only to scleroderma in producing
lung disease. However, RA is most frequently implicated in pro￾ducing a UIP-pattern in lung biopsies.9–12 Readers interested in
exploring the other RDs with pleuro-pulmonary manifestations
are referred to several excellent reviews.9 10 13 The distinguish￾ing clinical, radiological and histopathological features are dis￾cussed below and summarised in table 2.
Distinguishing clinical features
Advanced pulmonary fibrosis in RD is often apparent in cases in
which the connective tissue disease is well established. However,
there are also cases in which the presence of ILD may precede
the systemic or serological manifestations of the disease by
months or even years.10 Interestingly, ILD is more commonly
seen in men with RA, despite RA being more common in
women.14 High titres of rheumatoid factor and a smoking
history are also highly associated with ILD in RA.15 16 From a
clinical perspective, younger age at onset, unexplained joint or
cutaneous manifestations and suggestive serologic abnormalities
all play important roles in distinguishing UIP in IPF from
UIP-pattern disease in RILD.
Distinguishing radiological features
General clues to the diagnosis of UIP in RD are the presence of
other radiological clues to RD, including pleural or pericardial
effusions (SLE, RA), dilated oesophagus (scleroderma), follicular
bronchiolitis/lymphoid interstitial pneumonia (RA, Sjogren), or
rarely rheumatoid nodules (RA).17 Interstitial fibrosis can be in the
pattern of non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) or UIP,
depending on the underlying disorder, but when a UIP-pattern is
present, the prognosis appears to be better than that of UIP in IPF.
The common findings are reticular opacities, lobular distortion
and traction bronchiectasis or bronchiolectasis (figure 4A). When
honeycomb cysts occur in RA, the disease may mimic IPF perfectly,
especially if there is no evidence of airways abnormalities, such as

interstitial pneumonia pattern of
disease in the background which may
be mistaken as ‘normal’ in comparison
with the large zones of fibrosis (C,
20×, H&E), and follicular bronchiolitis
(D, 400×, H&E).

fuzzy centrilobular nodules, ground-glass opacities (figure 4B), or
bronchial and bronchiolar wall thickening with heterogeneous
lung attenuation.
Distinguishing histopathological features
Lymphoid hyperplasia at very low magnification (figure 5A) is a
very helpful feature suggesting UIP in RILD as the correct diagnosis.
The number of lymphoid follicles and interstitial B and T cells tend
to be greater in RA-related UIP than in the idiopathic UIP of
IPF.18 19 In less fibrotic areas, the lymphoid hyperplasia may be seen
in a peribronchiolar distribution with associated PBM (figure 5B).
In RILD, less advanced areas of parenchymal fibrosis may show
subtle interstitial thickening with either inflammatory cells or fibro￾sis. This pattern of interstitial involvement suggests a NSIP pattern
of injury as the primary event, and strongly argues against UIP of
IPF (figure 5C). Surgical pathologists who do not routinely interpret
pulmonary wedge biopsies for ILD may mistake these less involved
areas for ‘normal lung’, incorrectly supporting a diagnosis of UIP of
IPF. Two-thirds of cases of RA show a diffuse fibrosing lung disease
with almost equal proportions of UIP and NSIP pattern.20–22
Lymphoid aggregates and follicles with germinal centres follow the
airways with resulting chronic follicular bronchiolitis (figure 5D).
Another helpful differential characteristic is the presence of overlap￾ping acute, subacute (organising pneumonia) and chronic changes
in the same biopsy sample when RILD produce pulmonary fibrosis.
Some studies have shown that patients with RILD have fewer fibro￾blastic foci, smaller honeycomb cysts and less emphysema than
patients with IPF.19 Pleural fibrosis is uncommon in IPF (the disease
begins in subpleural lung, not pleura), but is typically present in RA
and other RDs with thoracic manifestations.
UIP-pattern IN CHRONIC HYPERSENSITIVITY
PNEUMONITIS
Definition
HP is a diffuse parenchymal lung disease resulting from inhal￾ation of mainly organic antigens by susceptible individuals.
Clinical presentations range broadly, based on dose of antigen
and frequency/chronicity of exposure, producing acute, sub￾acute, or chronic disease at presentation.23–25 Acute and sub￾acute HP are not relevant to our topic as neither produces a
UIP-pattern, and these can be explored elsewhere.26–30 The dis￾tinguishing clinical, radiological and histopathological features
of CHrHP are discussed below and summarised in table 3.
Distinguishing clinical features
The clinical history often reveals a temporal relationship
between symptoms and some environmental exposure. Potential
offending environmental agents may include certain pets, espe￾cially birds, exposure to farming-related dusts or fumes, humidi￾fiers, vaporisers, hot tubs, indoor swimming pools and residual
water damage to drywall, carpet, or other indoor furnishings.31
The exposure may be occupational or occurring at home. The
clinician must take an exhaustive history of work, home and pet
exposures, and focus on any exposure to dust, smoke, or fumes
of any type. Almost any indoor environment may be a potential
source of an antigen causing HP. ChrHP typically presents with
an insidious or gradual onset of dyspnoea, cough, fatigue,
malaise and chest tightness.31 Physical findings include bilateral
basilar crackles or wheezes. Clubbing is uncommon at presenta￾tion, but if present, predicts clinical deterioration.30 Serum pre￾cipitating antibodies to a variety of commonly implicated

antigens have characteristic low sensitivity and specificity. They
are helpful when positive, but not helpful when negative.
Pulmonary function tests typically show a restrictive pattern
with low lung volumes and diffusing capacity.32
Distinguishing radiological features
The imaging features of chronic HP are dominated by fibrosis
(figure 6A), honeycomb change that involves the lower lobes, and
in 80% of cases involvement of the upper lobes simultaneously
(figure 6B). Sometimes, honeycomb change is predominant in
upper lobes, a finding that when present, is distinctive of UIP in
CHrHP.
17 Although interstitial fibrosis can have an NSIP or UIP
pattern, one of the key distinguishing features in HP is the pres￾ence of air-trapping (figure 6B) that is exaggerated on expiration
scans due to underlying constrictive bronchiolitis (also referred to
as ‘mosaic perfusion’ or ‘mosaic attenuation’).33 34

Distinguishing histopathological features
Occasional cases of CHrHP will show advanced fibrosis that is
indistinguishable from that seen in UIP of IPF. However, there are
several histopathological clues to help suggest CHrHP as the aeti￾ology. Because chronic HP is a result of repeated inhalational
exposure, the primary site of injury is the airways. It makes aetio￾logic sense that most cases of CHrHP will show a centrilobular
dominant pattern of fibrosis35 36 (figure 7A), as opposed to the
subpleural and periseptal fibrosis of UIP of IPF (where centrilobu￾lar sparing is the norm). Centrilobular fibrosis is characterised by
peribronchiolar fibrosis with bronchiolar distortion and occlusion
by scarring and smooth muscle hyperplasia. Respiratory bronch￾ioles are frequently involved. Bridging fibrosis is frequently identi￾fied in HP.25 37–39 It is represented as linear fibrotic connection
between centrilobular and perilobular areas (subpleural or/and
paraseptal) or between centrilobular and adjacent centrilobular
area. Similarly, the fibroblast foci of CHrHP are typically present
at the edge of the fibrosis in peribronchiolar areas.39 25 Again, like
most inhalational disease, ChrHP affects the upper lobes early in
the course of disease. Surgical biopsy from more than one lobe is
essential to distinguish UIP of IPF from UIP-pattern in CHrHP.40
PBM is a very common finding in CHrHP (figure 7B), and if it is
seen diffusely throughout the biopsy, a careful search for other his￾topatholological support for CHrHP is warranted.41 42 The
‘smoking gun’ of CHrHP is the poorly formed interstitial granu￾loma, or rare aggregate of interstitial giant cells (figure 7C,D).
Unfortunately, the frequency of this finding seems to decrease with
increasing fibrosis. Other findings in CHrHP that help to differen￾tiate it from UIP of IPF are the presence of inflammatory bronchio￾litis with lymphoplasmacytic infiltration.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
UIP-pattern fibrosis in IPF can often be distinguished from other
common forms of diffuse lung fibrosis by close examination of
the clinical context, radiological features and histopathology in
the individual patient. Figure 8 illustrates the scanning magnifi￾cation differences between UIP of IPF, RILD and CHrHP.
Because several of the key distinguishing features are identifiable
at scanning magnification, an attempt to review the whole case
initially at low magnification is essential. This should be fol￾lowed by higher magnification investigation for other findings.
Table 4 highlights the key clinical, radiological and pathological
features of the most common causes of a UIP-pattern.
In our experience with a busy ILD consultative practice,
common pitfalls include diagnosing UIP of IPF in young patients,
not giving enough attention to the robust lymphoid infiltrate of
RILD, ignoring the background NSIP-pattern of RILD and
CHrHP, and focusing too much on areas of MHR which are really
just areas of ‘end-stage’ lung fibrosis, to coin a term commonly
used in the renal pathology literature. Identifying the correct diag￾nosis in this setting has significant implications for therapy today
and new therapies tomorrow, even if pulmonary fibrosis from any
cause carries significant morbidity and mortality.
Take-home messages
▸ Not all cases showing a usual interstitial pneumonia-pattern
(UIP-pattern) of fibrosis are secondary to idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).
▸ A variety of histologic clues often allows a pathologist to
discern between IPF and the two other common diseases
which show a UIP-pattern of fibrosis, rheumatic interstitial
lung disease and chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
Clinical and radiological differences, highlighted in this
manuscript, can also be used to support pathologic
hypotheses.
