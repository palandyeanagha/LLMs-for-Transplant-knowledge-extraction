Abstract
Background: Citrulline has been described as a marker of intestinal function or absorption but evidence varies 
according to clinical settings.
Objective: To examine the evidence of plasma citrulline as a marker of intestinal function and absorption in 
various clinical settings.
Methods: Studies were examined for p-values, means and standard deviations, correlation coefficients or other 
metrics depicting the association of citrulline with intestinal function. A random effects model was used to 
produce a pooled estimate. A hierarchical summary receiver operating curve model was fitted for diagnostic 
accuracy measures.
Results: Citrulline levels are correlated strongly with small bowel length in short bowel syndrome patients 
(r=0.67). Citrulline is strongly negatively correlated (r=-0.56) with intestinal disease severity with regards to 
enteropathies (coeliac disease, tropical enteropathy, Crohn’s disease, mucositis, acute rejection in intestinal 
transplantation). Citrulline cut-off levels have an overall sensitivity and specificity of 80% and 84% 
respectively. Citrulline levels in untreated coeliac patients compared to controls were reduced by 10μmol/L. 
Citrulline levels increase with gluten free diet and with improvement of enteropathy. Citrulline is decreased 
in critical illness and sepsis.
Conclusion: These findings allow us to advocate quite reasonably that citrulline is a marker of acute and 
chronic intestinal insufficiency.

Key summary
1. Summarise the established knowledge on this subject
 Citrulline is a non-protein amino acid, and in humans its plasma content is derived largely from the 
amount produced in enterocytes of the small bowel.
 Certain clinical conditions have been identified in which citrulline has been used as a marker of 
intestinal function.
 It is not clear whether citrulline levels reflect intestinal function (notably absorption), enterocyte mass, 
both or other.
2. What are the significant and/or new findings of this study?
 Citrulline is positively correlated with small bowel length in short bowel syndrome with lower 
citrulline levels are indicative of intestinal insufficiency.
 Citrulline is moderately correlated with enteral absorption in various conditions. 
 Citrulline is negatively correlated with disease severity in intestinal enteropathies.
 Citrulline cut-off levels have a sensitivity and specificity of 80%; 20μmol/L seems to be the most 
prevalent cut-off level.

Introduction
Citrulline is a non-protein amino acid, and in humans its plasma content is derived largely from the amount 
produced in enterocytes of the small bowel.
1 Citrulline’s first isolation from the juice of the watermelon has 
been attributed to Koga and Ohtake2, 3 and Wada.4 Certain clinical conditions have been identified in which 
citrulline has been used as a marker of intestinal function.
5-7 However, it is not clear whether citrulline levels 
reflect intestinal function (notably absorption), enterocyte mass, or both, with its current use being
interchangeable. Hence, due to citrulline’s unique metabolism, this systematic review aims to answer whether 
citrulline is a successful indicator of intestinal enterocyte mass and absorption and what clinical conditions it 
has been utilized in as a marker.
Methods
The inclusion criterion for this systematic review was any empirical study describing investigation of citrulline 
in relation to intestinal function. PRISMA guidelines and MOOSE checklist for systematic reviews and meta￾analyses were used.
8, 9 Electronic database searches were conducted with no year limits. The quality of studies 
was assessed with elements from Cochrane Collaboration’s tool10 and the RTI Item Bank for Observational 
Studies.
11, 12 For the meta-analysis, studies were examined for p-values, means and standard deviations, 
correlation coefficients or other metrics depicting the association of citrulline with intestinal function. Metrics 
were converted to the standardized mean difference (SMD),
13, 14 mean difference (MD),
15 and/or correlation 
coefficient (CC). A random effects model was used to produce a pooled estimate of the SMDs/MDs/CCs. 
Heterogeneity was quantified using the I
2
statistic and further investigated with subgroup analysis and meta￾regression. Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots, Egger’s test, Begg’s test and Rosenthal’s 
number.
16-19 The CC is converted to the Fisher’s z for all analyses.15 Regarding diagnostic accuracy data, a
hierarchical summary receiver operating curve (HSROC) model was fitted to provide a summary receiver 
operating curve and to allow derivation of pooled sensitivity and specificity estimates.
20 The methods in more 
detail are described in the Supplementary Materials.
Results
From 463 initial studies, 131 were included in the systematic review and 63 in the meta-analyses performed
(Figure 1). Overall number of patients was 4,292 (mean 68, range 6-847) with mean age 31.6 years, male 
percentage 50.9% and BMI 21.9kg/m2
. Twenty three studies involved children and forty involved adults and 
the majority of studies were conducted in Europe (45 studies). Mean citrulline value from all studies was 
23.2μmol/L and citrulline was mostly measured with High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). 
Main findings from all studies are shown in Supplementary Tables 1-6, grouped by condition. There was a 
strong presence of detection bias and almost 50% confounding bias (Figure 2, Supplementary Figure 1). 
Reporting bias was also an issue that arose from the papers. 
--Figure 1, Figure 2 here--
Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC)
Four studies have assessed citrulline levels in patients with NEC (Supplementary Table 1). Risk of bias was
low in most studies. The MD indicated a significant decrease in citrulline levels by -7.8μmol/L (95% CI [-
14.7, -0.9]; I
2=98%) compared to control, which indicated a strong decrease when the SMD was analysed -
1.44 (95% CI [-2.80, -0.07]; I
2=96%). Celik, Demirel 21 described that the area under the receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve for citrulline to differentiate NEC from controls was 0.88 (95% CI [0.77, 0.99]) 
and cut-off level of citrulline was 13.15µmol/L with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 82% but no 
association with duration of parenteral nutrition was noted. Similarly, Ioannou, Diamanti 22 noted that the area 
under the ROC curve for plasma citrulline to discriminate neonates with NEC from control neonates was 0.86 
(95% CI [0.77, 0.96]). The citrulline level that maximized the test’s sensitivity and specificity was 
17.75μmol/L, with a sensitivity of 76% and a specificity of 87%.
Intestinal Transplantation
Measurement of citrulline levels has been investigated as a possible indicator of intestinal transplant rejection. 
Thirteen studies were identified in the literature search and two groups have published quite extensively in the 

3
field: the University of Miami, School of Medicine23 and the Mount Sinai School of Medicine24
(Supplementary Table 2). 
These studies’ focus is the ability of citrulline levels to predict the grade of acute cellular rejection and the 
cut-off value of citrulline levels that yield a high possibility of acute cellular rejection. There was presence of 
detection bias and confounding because not all studies assessed possible confounders of associations. Also, 
there is a strong possibility of reporting bias and attrition bias, because many papers are published in 
Transplantation Proceedings, which publishes short reports from transplant centres (Supplementary Figure 
1). The initial studies by the Miami group described a moderate negative CC of citrulline levels with rejection 
(Pappas, Saudubray 25 reported CC=-0.590) but in the recent studies by Ruiz, Tryphonopoulos 26 and Hibi, 
Nishida 27, which include up to around 10,000 plasma citrulline samples, correlation reaches up to a strong -
0.977 with acute cellular rejection. The CCs are shown in Supplementary Figure 2 without meta-analysis due 
to severe heterogeneity. 
Two other trends were noted in the transplantation articles: first, citrulline appears to normalize after a certain 
amount time post transplantation and this is a significant factor against rejection;
28-31 secondly, the cut-off 
value of citrulline predicting rejection varies. The Miami group have described that citrulline levels have a 
very high negative predictive value for moderate or severe acute rejection (negative prognostic value=99% 
with cut-off level 13μmol/L; sensitivity=96.4% with particularly high specificity in adult patients);
27, 32, 33 but 
the Mount Sinai Group did not find that citrulline had satisfactory diagnostic accuracy to discern rejection.
34
Multiple parameters need to be taken into account when measuring citrulline in this group, including time 
after surgery, renal function, graft pathology, infection, sepsis, donor and patient anthropometrics.
24, 29, 34
Short Bowel Syndrome (SBS)
Thirty five papers and abstracts were identified which included eventually 26 studies (Supplementary Table 
3). Quality assessment showed possibilities of reporting, attrition and detection bias (Figure 2).
Citrulline and Residual Small Bowel Length
Twenty one studies were analysed and the random effects analysis of CCs produced a pooled effect of 0.67
(95% CI [0.39, 0.84], range [0.26, 0.99]), which indicates a strong correlation (Figure 3). In addition there 
was evidence of publication bias (funnel plot asymmetry, Egger’s test p=0.001 but Begg’s test p=0.156, Fail￾safe N=5,286) and high heterogeneity (I
2=97%, p<0.001) (Figure 4).
--Figure 3, Figure 4 here--
When analysed by subgroups, heterogeneity remained high with respect to patient type, measurement method, 
but was reduced in studies from the USA, Spain and Italy. (Supplementary Figure 3). Meta-regression also 
did not identify any heterogeneity with respect to male percentage, mean age, mean BMI, mean citrulline 
concentration and mean small bowel length (Supplementary Table 7).
Citrulline between SBS Patients and Healthy Controls
Twelve studies were analysed and the random effects model showed that citrulline levels were decreased by 
-12μmol/L (95% CI [-16.3, -7.7]) (SMD -1.34, 95% CI [-1.77, -0.91]); there was heterogeneity (MD: I
2=92%, 
p<0.001; SMD: I
2=80%, p<0.001) (Figure 6A) but no publication bias (symmetric funnel plot, Egger’s test 
p=0.606, Begg’s test p=0.537, Fail-safe N=853) (Supplementary Figure 5B).
Citrulline Levels in Parenteral Nutrition (PN) Dependent vs PN Independent Patients
Twelve studies were analysed comparing levels of citrulline in patients who needed PN against patients who 
were weaned off PN. The random effects model showed that citrulline levels were decreased by -13.3μmol/L 
(95% CI [-17.6, -9.0]) (SMD -1.58, 95% CI [-2.09, -1.08]); there was heterogeneity (MD: I
2=89%, p<0.001;
SMD: I
2=79%, p<0.001) but no publication bias (symmetric funnel plot, Egger’s test p=0.174, Begg’s test 
p=0.451, Fail-safe N=753) (Supplementary Figures 4A and 5D).
Sixteen studies described diagnostic accuracy results (Supplementary Table 8). Overall, citrulline levels have 
a sensitivity of 82.5% and specificity 82% (Supplementary Table 9, Supplementary Figure 6). Since thirteen 
studies compared citrulline levels at a cut-off level of 20μmol/L to discern among SBS patients who needed 

4
PN or not, the meta-analysed sensitivity and specificity reflect mostly that. Any heterogeneity present is due 
to different cut-off levels and comparison groups. 
Teduglutide and Citrulline Levels
There have been four studies studying the effect of teduglutide – a GLP-2 analogue which acts as a growth 
factor in patients with SBS – on citrulline levels (Supplementary Table 3). Three studies compared citrulline 
levels in patients who received teduglutide against patients who received placebo in Crohn’s disease and SBS. 
The random effects model showed that citrulline levels in teduglutide vs placebo were increased by 
12.4μmol/L (95% CI [5.5, 19.3]) (SMD 1.02, 95% CI [0.47, 1.58]) and there was heterogeneity (MD: I
2=85%, 
p=0.001; SMD: I
2=73%, p=0.02). Four studies provided citrulline levels of patients who received teduglutide 
at the end of treatment compared to their baseline. The random effects model showed that citrulline levels in
teduglutide at end of treatment vs baseline were increased by 15.3μmol/L (95% CI [12.5, 18.2]) (SMD 1.21, 
95% CI [1.00, 1.43]); there was no heterogeneity (MD: I
2=16, p=0.31; SMD: I
2=0%, p=0.56) (Supplementary 
Figures 4B,C).
Enteropathies
Villous Atrophy Syndrome
Eleven studies were used in meta-analyses in this category which included cases that had coeliac disease or 
other enteropathy (Supplementary Table 4). Meta-analyses firstly compare citrulline levels in diseased patients 
against controls, then those who had received gluten free diet (GFD) compared to those who had not, and 
finally association of citrulline levels with disease severity. Severity of disease was categorised broadly and 
included either histological diagnoses, worsening symptoms or any other metric reported by authors which 
indicated severity of the enteropathy. Severity is to be considered as a scale by which higher values indicate 
more severe disease and lower values indicate less severe disease. The random effects model showed that 
citrulline levels in coeliac disease patients compared to control were decreased by -9.7μmol/L (95% CI [-13.8, 
-5.6]) (SMD -0.99, 95% CI [-1.30, -0.67]); there was heterogeneity (MD: I
2=89%, p<0.001; SMD: I
2=78%, 
p<0.001) but no publication bias (symmetric funnel plot, Egger’s test p=0.247, Begg’s test p=0.283) (Figure 
6A, Supplementary Figure 5C). The random effects model showed that citrulline levels were decreased by -
8.2μmol/L (95% CI [-10.4, -5.9]) (SMD -1.08, 95% CI [-1.42, -0.75]) in those patients who had not received 
GFD compared to those who had (Supplementary Figure 4D).
35-39
Crohn’s Disease
Citrulline levels were compared between Crohn’s disease patients and controls in two studies.
40, 41 The random 
effects model showed that citrulline levels in patients vs controls was decreased by -9.7μmol/L (95% CI [-
12.6, -6.7]) (SMD -1.19, 95% CI [-1.63, -0.75]); there was no heterogeneity (MD: I
2=0%, p=0.90; SMD:
I
2=0%, p=0.99) (Figure 6A).
Acute Mucosal Enteropathy and Cancer Treatments
Acute mucosal enteropathy can cause a significant loss of enterocytes. Fourteen studies were used in meta￾analysis in this category which included cases of patients had received chemoradiation for bone marrow 
transplant, cancer or other malignant disorder (Supplementary Table 5). Generally:
1. Citrulline decreases in the initial phase of treatment and then increases while the initial gastrointestinal 
toxicity related to treatment seem to reside.
2. Citrulline decrease is related to higher doses of treatment and is usually inversely correlated with severity 
of gastrointestinal toxicity. Meta-analysis was performed on this outcome since 14 studies were identified.
The random effects model showed that citrulline levels were negatively correlated with severity of 
gastrointestinal toxicity with a moderate correlation of -0.41 (95% CI [-0.51, -0.30]); there was no 
heterogeneity (I
2=43%, p=0.04) and no publication bias (symmetric funnel plot, Egger’s test p=0.009, Begg’s 
test p=0.102) (Figure 6B, Supplementary Figure 5F).
Critical Illness Patients
Twenty five studies were diagnosed investigating citrulline levels in patients with critical illness 
(Supplementary Table 6). The majority of studies involves patients in intensive care settings which attempt to 

5
correlate decrease in citrulline levels with severity of condition or other sepsis markers. No meta-analyses 
were performed on these studies due to different measurement methods and inability to extract common 
outcomes. The following comments can be made:
1. Citrulline appears decreased in most studies and is related to critical illness and markers of sepsis or 
inflammation.
2. This decrease in citrulline does not necessarily mean that there is intestinal dysfunction since in 
inflammatory responses and as severe as critical illness, nitric oxide and arginine are depleted through 
inflammatory pathways hence leading to the reduction of citrulline.42 This is also corroborated by the fact 
that citrulline levels increase once critical condition is overcome. 
3. Citrulline seems to act as a negative inflammatory marker.
Citrulline Levels: An Overall Assessment
Diagnostic Accuracy
Overall sensitivity of citrulline levels appear to be satisfactory 80% (95% CI [69%-87%]), specificity was 
84% (95% CI [77%-89%]) and the diagnostic odds ratio was 20.03 (Supplementary Table 9, Supplementary 
Figure 7). The sROC curve indicates overall satisfactory diagnostic accuracy of citrulline levels (Figure 5).
--Figure 5 here--
Citrulline Levels in Diseased Patients vs Controls
The random effects model showed that citrulline levels in patients vs controls (30 studies) was decreased by -
11.2μmol/L (95% CI [-13.8, -8.6]) (SMD -0.53, 95% CI [-0.69, -0.36]); there was heterogeneity (MD: I
2=95%, 
p=0.002; SMD: I
2=68.7%, p<0.001) (Figure 6A). No publication bias was observed (symmetric funnel plot, 
Egger’s test p=0.969, Begg’s test p=0.986) (Supplementary Figure 5A).
Citrulline Levels as a Marker of Intestinal Disease Severity
Citrulline levels were described in association with disease severity in 28 studies. The random effects model 
showed that citrulline levels were negatively correlated with severity of disease with a moderate correlation 
of -0.56 (95% CI [-0.70, -0.37]) (Figure 6B); there was heterogeneity (I
2=95%, p<0.001); but no publication 
bias (symmetric funnel plot, Egger’s test p=0.356, Begg’s test p=0.722) (Supplementary Figure 5E). 
Interestingly, we can see that only in Crohn’s disease citrulline is not associated with disease severity (Figure 
6B).
--Figure 6 here—
Citrulline and Absorptive Function
Fourteen studies reported an association of citrulline levels with the level of intestinal absorption. Absorption 
was assessed with the D-xylose absorption test,40, 43-48 oral or enteral nutrition tolerance,49-51 and nutrient 
absorption tests with bomb calorimetry and measuring oral/enteral intake in comparison to faecal and other 
loses.52-54 The random effects model showed that citrulline levels were positively correlated with enteral 
absorption with a moderate correlation of 0.50 (95% CI [0.26, 0.68]) (Figure 7) but there was heterogeneity 
(I
2=90%, p<0.001).
--Figure 7 here--
Conclusion
The present study is the first meta-analysis on the association of citrulline with gut function. Although 
citrulline appears to be a strong marker of enterocyte mass, its correlation with intestinal absorption is weaker.
This correlation appears clinically significant in SBS. In other conditions where short bowel is not an issue, 
there is a decrease in mean citrulline compared to healthy controls and citrulline decrease can be correlated to 
the degree of disease severity. Its interpretation however needs to take into account other factors because its 
diagnostic accuracy is satisfactory but not completely exclusive of negative cases and it might as well produce 

6
false positive cases. There were various thresholds for discerning a high from low citrulline level but the level 
of 20μmol/L seems to be most prevalent.
In critical illness the interpretation of a low citrulline as a marker of intestinal dysfunction should be treated 
with caution – in a similar manner that a low albumin in a critical ill patients needs to be cautiously interpreted 
as malnutrition. The availability of nitric oxide and arginine during septic and inflammatory states is decreased 
hence decreasing citrulline and in this context citrulline could be a negative inflammatory marker – without 
excluding enteropathy of acute illness.
Limitations of the present meta-analysis stem from various sources of heterogeneity and possibility of 
publication bias, detection bias and confounding bias. It was a pattern in the present review that many studies 
did not analyse confounding factors such as other amino acids, renal function (citrulline’s pathways involve a 
renal component) and inflammatory state. Also different methods exist for plasma citrulline measurement, 
sample preparation, population parameters, disease severity, absorption, and small bowel length. Although 
heterogeneity is partially explained by geographical factors, ultimately this reflects different clinical and 
analytical practices throughout the world. The random effects models performed take heterogeneity into 
account and thus were the preferred method of analysis. Standardization of measurement methods and 
practices will possibly allow for comparable and more homogeneous results, resulting in meaningful clinical 
interpretation. 
Although interest in citrulline originated from intestinal failure and intestinal transplant medicine, we believe 
that its application extends to the general gastroenterologist since it has to do with intestinal function per se. 
Is the bowel working? This exact question has led investigation into citrulline’s response in enteropathies such 
as Crohn’s disease, coeliac disease, critical care enteropathy, and mucositis related to bone marrow transplant 
and chemo-radiotherapy so far. Serial citrulline measurements seem to reflect patterns of mucosal barrier 
injury and hence are associated with septic episodes in transplant and critical illness patients, setting the 
ground for use as a marker of early intestinal dysfunction. Its use in SBS is multifactorial, assisting towards 
the decision of the absorptive capacity of the bowel and hence the need for PN. Nevertheless, citrulline needs 
be considered within the individual patient context due to measurement variations between centres, countries 
and populations, with unequal normal ranges and average values. The presence of heterogeneous results in 
the present systematic review reflects this, possibly also explaining its current niche status (as yet). 
In conclusion, citrulline concentration is decreased compared to controls in intestinal compromise states; it 
has a sensitivity and specificity of ~80%; it is negatively correlated with disease severity in intestinal 
enteropathies; it is positively correlated with small bowel length in short bowel syndrome; and it is moderately 
correlated with enteral absorption in various conditions. Overall, lower citrulline levels are indicative of acute 
or chronic intestinal insufficiency.

Study Eligibility Criteria
The inclusion criteria for this systematic review were: any empirical study (abstract and full paper) describing 
investigation of citrulline in relation to the term intestinal function. Intestinal function was considered in a 
very broad term and could mean enterocyte mass, diarrhoea, absorption, or even deranged citrulline levels in 
correlation with a compromised gut. The only papers that were excluded were those whose object of 
investigation was not related to intestinal function. There was no restriction to language of papers and the 
types of interventions could include observational studies, randomized controlled trials, case series and case 
reports. For the meta-analysis papers had to provide sufficient data to produce an effect measure.
Search Strategy and Terms
PRISMA guidelines and MOOSE checklist for systematic reviews and meta-analyses were used 8, 9. Electronic 
database searches were conducted in Google Scholar, Pubmed/Medline, Scopus, EMBASE and Cochrane 
Library with no year limits. Publisher databases were also searched (Sciencedirect.com, link.springer.com, 
Wiley library Online, Highwire Press, Nature.com, Ovid, Cambridge University Press). The search keywords 
were: citrulline, intestine, gut, bowel, intestinal, mucositis, Crohn’s disease, short bowel, radiotherapy, cancer, 
sepsis, absorption, enterocyte, critically ill, and colitis. The date of search was up until 1 July 2015. The 
bibliographies from all included manuscripts and hand searching of relevant gastroenterology and nutrition 
journals were used to identify further references. The present study does not report results of a clinical trial 
and it did not involve primary research on humans.
Study Selection, Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
The resulting studies (in abstract form) were assessed against the inclusion criteria. When there was 
insufficient information available in the abstract, the full text was reviewed. Then, data were extracted from 
the selected studies including: author, year of publication, aim of the study, country, continent, sample size, 
mean age, male percentage, study design, results. The quality of studies (risk of bias) was assessed with 
elements from Cochrane Collaboration’s tool10 and the RTI Item Bank for Observational Studies,11, 12 which 
assess selection, attrition, detection and confounding biases. For the meta-analysis, studies were examined for 
p-values, means and standard deviations, correlation coefficients or other metrics depicting the association of 
citrulline with intestinal function. Metrics were converted to the standardized mean difference (SMD) 13, 14 or 
weighted mean difference (WMD), where means and standard deviations for groups under comparison were 
identified,15 and/or correlation coefficients (CCs). Examples of outcomes included correlations of citrulline 
levels with small bowel length, with absorption tests/enteral caloric intake, differences in citrulline between 
tests groups and controls etc. Particularly, we included studies that satisfied the following criteria: a) for
correlations of citrulline with small bowel length, only short bowel syndrome; b) for absorptive marker 
correlations, all patient groups c) for gastrointestinal disease severity, all patient groups. Where available, 
diagnostic accuracy data were also collected.
Statistical Analysis
Quantitative analysis was performed with Stata 12.0 (StataCorp LP, Texas), Review Manager 5.3 (Cochrane 
Collaboration, Copenhagen), SPSS 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY), and R (R Foundation for Statistical 
Computing, Vienna, Austria). SMDs/WMDs/CCs were extracted from studies when available. The strength 
of association was categorized as following: small, SMD = 0.2; moderate, SMD = 0.5; and large, SMD = 0.8; 
WMD has units and reflects the units of the outcome under description; small, CC = 0.1; moderate, CC = 0.3; 
and large, CC = 0.5.55, 56 A random effects model was used to produce a pooled estimate of the 
SMDs/WMDs/CCs. With the random effect model, studies are weighted by the inverse of their variance with 
tau-squared (τ
2
), taking into account the within study variance for estimating the correlation coefficient in each 
study and the between studies variance (e.g. because of different designs or methods used but also possible 
biological reasons) 57. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran’s Q test, which examines the null 
hypothesis that all studies are evaluating the same effect 58. Statistical significance for heterogeneity was set 
as p ≤ 0.10. Heterogeneity was quantified using the I
2
statistic, indicating the percentage of total variation 
across studies that is due to heterogeneity rather than chance 58
. I
2
value of 0 % was considered to indicate no 
observed heterogeneity whilst a value > 50 % substantial heterogeneity 19, 59-61. Heterogeneity was further 
investigated with subgroup analysis and meta-regression. Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots, 
Egger’s test, Begg’s test and Rosenthal’s number 16-18. A funnel plot was created for the clinical measures 
with more than 10 studies 62. This is a scatter plot of the effect estimates from individual studies against a 

13
measurement of the study’s sample size or precision. Resemblance of a symmetrical inverted funnel supports 
that findings are due to sampling variation alone; thus, absence of bias 62
.
Regarding correlation coefficients, it is common practice not to perform syntheses on the correlation 
coefficient itself because the variance depends strongly on the correlation. Rather, the correlation is converted 
to the Fisher’s z scale (not to be confused with the z-statistics used with significance tests), and all analyses 
are performed using the transformed values. The results, such as the summary effect and its confidence 
interval, would then be converted back to correlations for presentation. The transformation from sample 
correlation r to Fisher’s z is given by

Regarding diagnostic accuracy data, following the robust construction of the diagnostic 2 × 2 tables, 
specificity, sensitivity, and 95% CI for each of the included studies was calculated. A hierarchical summary 
receiver operating curve (HSROC) model was fitted to provide a summary receiver operating curve and to 
allow derivation of pooled sensitivity and specificity estimates 20. As suggested by the Cochrane Diagnostic 
Test Accuracy group (http://srdta.cochrane.org/), no analyses of study heterogeneity were performed, as these 
tests do not account for heterogeneity explained by phenomena, such as positivity threshold effects 10

nutrition dependence was used to define permanent (n = 37) and transient (n = 
20) intestinal failure
 Absorptive function, studied over a 3-day period, was evaluated by net digestive 
absorption for protein and fat 
 Relations between quantitative values were assessed by linear regression analysis 
and cut-off citrulline threshold, for a diagnosis of intestinal failure by linear 
discriminant analysis 
 Short bowel syndrome vs controls (n = 51): 20 ± 13 vs. 40 ± 10 μmol/L (p < 0.001)

 A cut-off level of 20 μmol/L classified short bowel patients with permanent intestinal failure with 
high sensitivity (92%), specificity (90%), positive predictive value (95%), and negative value 
(86%) and was a more reliable indicator (odds ratio 20.0, 95% CI 1.9-206.1) than anatomic

 Citrulline levels correlated positively with bowel length (r = 0.73; p < 0.0001) and were a strong 
predictor of parenteral nutrition independence (p = 0.002; area under the ROC curve = 0.88; 95% 
CI 0.75-1.00). 
 Optimal citrulline cut-off point distinguishing patients who reached parenteral nutrition 
independence was 15 μmol/L (sensitivity = 89%; specificity = 78%).

17 Picot, Garin 54  Twenty-six patients with small bowel disruption and double enterostomy were 
treated with chyme reperfusion
 Faecal wet weight, nitrogen and fat absorption, parenteral nutrition delivery and 
citrulline were measured before and after the initiation of chyme reperfusion with 
a median follow-up of 30 days.
 Chyme reperfusion decreased the intestinal wet weight output and parenteral nutrition dependence 
 Chyme reperfusion was associated with a rise in net nitrogen and fat digestive absorption and 
citrulline (17.0 ± 10.0 vs 31.0 ± 12.0 μmol/L, p = 0.0001). 
 Before the initiation of chyme reperfusion, citrulline levels correlated positively with the absorptive 
post-duodenal small bowel length (r = 0.39, p = 0.04), but not with the total post-duodenal small 
bowel length (r = 0.11, P = 0.60).

 Sample: Between March 2005 and March 2010, 28 short bowel syndrome
patients on parenteral nutrition
 Citrulline levels and enteral intake determinations were measured on inclusion
and at 6-month intervals
 Citrulline significantly correlated with the residual duodenum-jejunum length (r2 = 0.22, p = 
0.0113) and with enteral intake (r2 = 0.20, p = 0.016, r2 = 0.48, p = 0.0001)
 Baseline citrulline over 10 μmol/L and a longitudinal increase >25% provided a weak association 
with bowel adaptation (likelihood ratios 2.6 and 2.4, respectively), unlike residual small bowel 
length ≥ 20 cm and the presence of > 50% of the colon.

 Sample: 32 haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients following intensive 
myeloablative therapy during the first 3 weeks after transplantation when 
patients have oral mucositis
 Significant decline in serum concentrations of citrulline following intensive myeloablative therapy 
during the first 3 weeks after transplantation when patients have oral mucositis and a markedly 
disturbed gut integrity
 Closer inspection of citrulline concentrations of 12 patients confirmed that decline corresponded to 
the onset of oral mucositis and altered gut integrity
2 Lutgens, Deutz 112  Sample: 23 patients were studied weekly during treatment and at intervals of 2 
weeks and 3 and 6 months after treatment by post-absorptive plasma citrulline 
concentration and clinical toxicity grading. 
 The interrelationship between these variables and the correlation with small￾bowel dose and volume parameters were investigated. 
 During fractionated radiotherapy, citrulline concentration significantly decreased as a function of 
the radiation dose (p < 0.001) and the volume of small bowel treated (p = 0.001)
 Plasma citrulline concentration correlated with clinical toxicity during the last 3 weeks of 
treatment. As a whole, citrulline concentration correlated better with radiation dose and volume 
parameters than clinical toxicity grading.

 Intestinal mucosal barrier injury as detected by the NCI adverse events criteria was found in 55% 
of chemotherapy cycles, correlating well with the continuous daily gut score (n = 55, r = 0.581; p < 
0.001)
 Intestinal cell loss as measured by the ratio faecal human DNA/total DNA and plasma citrulline 
correlated well with both NCI criteria (r = 0.357, p = 0.005; r = -0.482, p < 0.001) and daily gut 
score (r = 0.352, p = 0.009; r = -0.625, p < 0.001)
 Plasma interleukin-8 correlated strongly to plasma citrulline (r = -0.627; p < 0.001).

10 Herbers, Feuth 117  Sample and design: Citrulline concentrations were determined at baseline and at 
least once weekly after the start of myeloablative chemotherapy until 30 days 
thereafter among 94 allogeneic or autologous haematopoietic stem-cell 
transplant recipients. 
 Intestinal mucosal damage was described either by level of citrulline on each 
day, on the basis of different thresholds of citrulline indicating the severity of 
villous atrophy, or by area under the curve using reciprocal value of 10/citrulline. 
 Regimens that incorporated idarubicin induced the most severe intestinal toxicity. 
 Scores based on the level of citrulline, using severity thresholds, and on the area under the 
reciprocal curve are able to discriminate between the damage induced by different high-dose 
chemotherapy regimens.

 Sample: 29 women undergoing pelvic radiotherapy for anal or uterine cancer 
were prospectively followed
 Fatigue and diarrhoea were assessed using patient self-reported questionnaires
 Plasma citrulline concentration, as a sign of intestinal injury, and C-reactive 
protein, orosomucoid, albumin, alpha-1-antitrypsin, and haptoglobin, as signs of 
systemic inflammation, were analysed. 
 Fatigue increased significantly (p < 0.001) and citrulline decreased significantly (p < .001) during 
treatment. 
 A significant negative correlation (r = -0.40; p < 0.05) was found between fatigue and epithelial 
atrophy in the intestine (as assessed by plasma citrulline) after 3 weeks of treatment and a 
significant positive correlation (r = 0.75; p < 0.001) was found between fatigue and diarrhoea.

 Sample: Retrospective analysis in 163 stem-cell transplant recipients of which 
data had been collected prospectively on intestinal damage (citrulline), 
inflammation (C-reactive protein), and neutrophil count. 
 Six different conditioning regimens were studied; 5 myeloablative and 1 non￾myeloablative
 Linear mixed model multivariate and AUC analyses were used to define the role 
of intestinal damage in post-SCT inflammation. 
 In the 5 myeloablative regimen there was a striking pattern of inflammatory response that coincided with the 
occurrence of severe intestinal damage
 This contrasted with a modest inflammatory response seen in the non-myeloablative regimen in which intestinal 
damage was limited. 
 With linear mixed model analysis the degree of intestinal damage was shown the most important determinant of 
the inflammatory response, and both neutropenia and bacteraemia had only a minor impact. 
 AUC analysis revealed a strong correlation between citrulline and C-reactive protein (r = 0.96). Intestinal 
damage was associated with the occurrence of bacteraemia and acute lung injury, and influenced the kinetics of 
acute graft-versus-host disease
13 Onal, Kotek 121  Sample: 53 patients (36 prostate cancer, 17 endometrial cancer) who received 45 
Gy pelvic radiotherapy using conventional fractionation
 Patients with prostate cancer received an additional 25-30.6 Gy conformal boost.
 Plasma citrulline levels were assessed on day 0, mid- (week 3) and post￾radiotherapy (week 8), and four months post-radiotherapy. 
 Dose-volume histogram, citrulline concentration changes, and weekly intestinal 
toxicity scores were analysed. 
 Citrulline concentrations were significantly reduced at week 3 (27.4 ± 5.9 μmol/L; p < 0.0001), treatment end 
(29.9 ± 8.8 μmol/L; p < 0.0001), and four months post-treatment (34.3 ± 12.1; p = 0.01).
 The following factor pairs were significantly positively correlated: Citrulline concentration/mean bowel dose 
during, end of treatment, and four months post-radiotherapy; dose-volume parameters/citrulline change groups; 
cumulative mean radiation dose/intestinal toxicity at end and four months post-radiotherapy; citrulline 
changes/intestinal toxicity during and end of radiotherapy. 
 Citrulline concentration changes significantly differed during treatment according to radiotherapy oncology 
group intestinal toxicity grades (p < 0.0001)

 Sample: Multicentre, prospective cohort study of 26 children to define time￾related changes in serum citrulline during the course of hematopoietic cell 
transplantation. Markers of gastrointestinal function including oral energy intake, 
emesis, stool volume, presence of graft-versus-host disease, oral mucositis 
severity, and cytokine and neurohormone levels were measured. 
 Weekly serum citrulline concentrations were obtained from 10 days prior until 
30 days after hematopoietic cell transplantation. 
 Mean baseline citrulline concentration was 22.7 μmol/L (95% CI 17.7-27.6) on day -10, which 
decreased to a nadir of 7.5 μmol/L (95% CI 3.1-18.0, p = 0.017) on day 8 following hematopoietic 
cell transplantation before returning to baseline by day 30.
 After adjustment for interleukin-6 level (1.0% lower citrulline per 10% increase in interleukin-6, p
= 0.004), presence of acute graft-versus-host disease (27% lower citrulline, p = 0.025), and oral 
energy intake (2.1% lower citrulline per 10% decrease in energy intake, p = 0.018), the nadir 
shifted to day 10, when mean citrulline concentration was lower in patients with severe oral 
mucositis (6.7 μmol/L, 95% CI 3.4-13.1) than in those without severe mucositis (11.9 μmol/L, 
95% CI 5.8-24.4, p = 0.003). 
 Change in citrulline was not correlated with stool volume, C-reactive protein, tumour necrosis 
factor-alpha, leptin, or ghrelin.
16 Karlik, Kesavan 124  Aim: To determine whether citrulline levels correlate with clinical markers of 
intestinal injury in children undergoing a myeloablative allogeneic transplant 
regimen
 For every 1 μmol/L increase in citrulline, the odds of developing mucositis were 0.88 (95% CI
0.79-0.99, p = 0.036)
 The odds of developing diarrhoea were 0.70 times less for every 1 μmol/L increase in citrulline 
(95% CI=0.59-0.84, p < 0.0001)

17 Brady, Horn 125  Sample: 15 patients treated with external beam radiation therapy to either 
prostate only (n=6) or prostate and pelvis (n=9).
 Plasma citrulline levels were measured prior to radiotherapy and weekly during 
treatment and at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months post external beam radiation 
therapy
 Bowel toxicity was assessed at the same time points using EPIC bowel summary 
scores. 
 The strongest correlation between the fall in plasma citrulline levels from baseline and greatest 
bowel toxicity was observed after 3 weeks of radiotherapy (p=0.03). 
 A strong predictive trend was noted with positive correlations at 6 weeks post radiotherapy (r =
0.594, p = 0.025), 3 months post radiotherapy (r = 0.534, p = 0.060), 6 months post radiotherapy (r
= 0.606, p = 0.037), 9 months post radiotherapy (r = 0.618, p = 0.019) and 1 year post radiotherapy 
(r =0.358, p = 0.345). 
 No significant correlation was found between changes in plasma citrulline levels or EPIC reported 
toxicity 
18 Kong, Wang 126  Sample: 42 patients with gastric or colorectal cancer underwent chemotherapy
 Patients were asked to grade and record their symptoms of gastrointestinal 
toxicity daily
 The urinary lactulose-mannitol ratio was measured to assess the intestinal 
permeability. 
 Plasma levels of citrulline, diamine oxidase, D-lactic acid, and endotoxin were 
also measured 
 The urinary lactulose-mannitol ratio and plasma citrulline levels increased on the third and sixth 
post-chemotherapy days, respectively
 There were no significant differences in the plasma levels of D-lactic acid, endotoxin or diamine 
oxidase activity compared to their levels before chemotherapy
19 Wang, Ling 127  Aim: To investigate the correlations between fatigue, diarrhoea, and alterations 
in gut microbiota induced by pelvic radiotherapy. 

 During the 5-week treatment of pelvic radiotherapy in 11 cancer patients, the general fatigue score 
significantly increased and was more prominent in the patients with diarrhoea. 
 The fatigue score was closely correlated with the decrease of serum citrulline and the increases of 
systemic inflammatory proteins, including haptoglobin, orosomucoid, alpha-1-antitrypsin and 
tumour necrosis factor-alpha.

Bartoušková 128
 Design: Plasma citrulline, serum neopterin and urinary neopterin were measured
weekly in 49 patients with rectal carcinoma during chemoradiation
 Citrulline significantly (p < 0.05) decreased while serum and urinary neopterin concentrations 
increased during therapy. 
 Irradiated gut volume correlated significantly inversely with citrulline and positively with urinary 
neopterin. 
 Statistically significant inverse correlations were also observed between urinary neopterin and 
plasma citrulline concentrations during the treatment. 
 Urinary neopterin concentrations were significantly higher and citrulline concentrations were 
lower in patients who experienced grade ≥ 3 gastrointestinal toxicity

 Design: The amino acid pattern in plasma was studied in a reference 
group (n=26) and in three groups of massive obese subjects (n=9, 8, 
and 9 respectively) before and at intervals after jejuno-ileostomy. 
 The concentrations of lysine, tyrosine, cystine, and glutamic acids were higher, and aspargin, glutamine, 
serine, and glycine were lower than in the reference group. 
 During the post-operative period the amino acid pattern changed significantly with serine, glycine, and 
taurine increased and valine, lysine, leucine, tryptophan, thyrosine, cystine, and citrulline decreased. 
 The amino acid pattern in the obese group with the longest post-operative observation time and a stable body 
weight differed significantly from that in the reference group only with regard to a low valine concentration 
and high concentration of taurine and glutamic acid.
2 Müller, Cüppers 130  Sample: 6 patients - infusing 0.3 mg/24 h of exogenous glucagon  In six normal subjects the same infusion reduced significantly (p < 0.05) plasma alanine, asparagine, 
glutamate, glutamine, glycine, proline, serine, threonine, arginine, ornithine, lysine and tyrosine
 This particular glucagon sensitivity of duodenopancreatectomized patients suggests that glucagon deficiency 
is the cause of their hyperaminacidaemia.

Ramias 131
 Sample: 10 obese and 10 non-obese traumatized patients
 Plasma levels of free amino acids in the early flow phase of injury 
when subjects were receiving maintenance fluids without calories or 
nitrogen
 Obese controls showed an increase in valine, leucine, isoleucine, and glutamic acid levels, and a decrease in 
glycine, tryptophan, threonine, histidine, taurine, citrulline, and cystine levels compared with lean controls. 
 Hypoaminoacidemia was equally seen in traumatized obese and non-obese patients, and it was mainly due to 
a 24% decrease in nonessential amino acids. 
 Essential amino acid levels were the same in all groups.

blood endotoxin were measured at admission, days 1-3 and 6
 Kinetics of release and the relationship between intestinal fatty acid￾binding protein, citrulline and endotoxin values
 Lowest median of citrulline was attained at day 2 (11 vs 24 μmol/L at admission, p = 0.01) and normalised at 
day 6 (21 μmol /L)
 Highest endotoxin level was negatively correlated lowest plasma citrulline levels (r

18 Kao, Hsu 146  Aim: To investigate how sepsis affects glutamine metabolism, 
including its conversion to citrulline, by measuring glutamine and 
citrulline flux, fractional splanchnic extraction of glutamine and 
leucine, and the contribution of glutamine nitrogen to citrulline in 
septic patients and healthy controls
 Sample: 8 patients with severe sepsis and 10 healthy controls were 
given primed, constant intravenous infusion of [2H2]citrulline and 
sequential administration of intravenous and enteral [α￾15N]glutamine 
and [13C]leucine in the post-absorptive state
 Compared with healthy controls, septic patients had a significantly lower whole body citrulline flux and 
plasma concentration, higher endogenous leucine flux, and higher glutamine clearance
 The majority of the 15N label transferred from glutamine to citrulline was found at the α-position
 Lower glutamine plasma concentrations in sepsis were a result of increased glutamine clearance
 Despite adequate splanchnic uptake of glutamine, there is decreased production of citrulline, suggesting a 
defect in the metabolic conversion of glutamine to citrulline, decreased uptake of glutamine by the enterocyte 
but increased uptake by the liver, and/or shunting of glutamine to other metabolic pathways
19 Piton, Belon 147  Design and Sample: 103 intensive care patients, prospective 
observational study

and variables relating to prognosis and treatment, were measured on 
admission
 Intestinal fatty acid-binding protein elevation on admission was associated with catecholamine support, 
higher lactate concentration, higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, and higher international 
normalized ratio (p < 0.001)
 Plasma citrulline concentration ≤ 10 μmol/L on admission was associated with higher intra-abdominal 
pressure, higher plasma C-reactive protein concentration, and more frequent antibiotic use (p < 0.005)
 No correlation between plasma levels of intestinal fatty acid-binding protein and citrulline
 On admission, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score ≥ 12, plasma citrulline ≤ 12.2 μmol /L, and plasma 
intestinal fatty acid-binding protein concentration ≥ 355 pg/mL were associated with higher 28-day mortality 
(odds ratio 4.39, 5.17, 4.46, respectively)

 Multivariate analysis: plasma citrulline levels ≤ 13.1 μmol/L and intestinal fatty acid-binding protein > 260 
pg/mL were independently associated with a poor neurological outcome (odds ratio 21.9, 13.6, respectively)

24 Piton, Cypriani 152  Aim: To examine whether catecholamines in critically ill patients may 
be associated with enterocyte damage
 Design: Prospective observational study. 
 Sample: Critically ill patients requiring epinephrine and/or 
norepinephrine on admission to intensive care (n = 60). Controls not 
receiving catecholamines (n = 27)
 Measurement on admission: plasma intestinal fatty acid-binding 
protein, plasma citrulline, abdominal perfusion pressure, and variables 
relating to prognosis and treatment
 Plasma intestinal fatty acid-binding protein was higher among patients receiving catecholamine vs controls
 In patients receiving catecholamines, a dose of 0.48 γ/kg/min or more on admission was associated with a 
higher intestinal fatty acid-binding protein concentration
 Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment score > 11 and plasma intestinal fatty acid-binding protein more 
than 524 pg/mL on admission were independently associated with 28-day mortality 
 Citrulline was not associated with catecholamine dose but was generally low: median 14.7 (8.8-27.9).
25 Poole, Deane 153  Sample: Prospective observational study, 15 healthy, 20 critically ill 
subjects
 Fasting plasma citrulline concentrations were assayed in blood 
samples immediately prior to the administration of a liquid test meal 
(1 kcal/ml; containing 3 g of 3-O-methylglucose) that was infused 
directly into the small intestine
 Serum 3-O-methylglucose concentrations were measured over the 
following 4 hours, with the area under the 3-O-methylglucose
concentration curve calculated as an index of glucose absorption
 Healthy subjects vs critically ill patients: citrulline 26.5 vs 15.2 μmol/L, p < 0.01; glucose absorption 79.7 vs 
61.0 mmol/L/240 min, p = 0.05
 No relationship between fasting citrulline concentration and subsequent glucose absorption was noted 
(r = 0.28; p = 0.12)
