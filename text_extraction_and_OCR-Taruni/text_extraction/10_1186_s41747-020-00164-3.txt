Abstract
Background: Time-resolved three-dimensional digital subtraction angiography (4D-DSA) can be used to quantify
blood velocity. Contrast pulsatility, a major discriminant on 4D-DSA, is yet to be optimized. We investigated the
effects of different imaging and injection parameters on sideband ratio (SBR), a measure of contrast pulsatile
strength, within the hepatic vasculature of an in vivo porcine model.
Methods: Fifty-nine hepatic 4D-DSA procedures were performed in three female domestic swine (mean
weight 54 kg). Contrast injections were performed in the common hepatic artery with different combinations
of imaging duration (6 s or 12 s), injection rates (from 1.0 to 2.5 mL/s), contrast concentration (50% or 100%),
and catheter size (4 Fr or 5 Fr). Reflux was recorded. SBR and vessel cross-sectional areas were calculated in
289 arterial segments. Multiple linear mixed-effects models were estimated to determine the effects of
parameters on SBR and cross-sectional vessel area.
Results: Twelve-second acquisitions yielded a SBR higher than 6 s (p < 0.001). No significant differences in
SBR were seen between different catheter sizes (p = 0.063) or contrast concentration (p = 0.907). For higher
injection rates (2.5 mL/s), SBR was lower (p = 0.007) and cross-sectional area was higher (p < 0.001). Reflux of
contrast does not significantly affect SBR (p = 0.087).
Conclusions: The strength of contrast pulsatility used for flow quantitation with 4D-DSA can be increased by
adjusting injection rates and using longer acquisition times. Reduction of contrast concentration to 50% is
feasible and reflux of contrast does not significantly hinder contrast pulsatility.

angiography (DSA)—i.e., four-dimensional (4D)-DSA—is a
recently developed angiographic imaging modality that can
provide quantitative information on blood flow within a 3D
vascular volume [1]. 4D-DSA has been used for obtaining
time-resolved flow information during interventional proce￾dures for cerebrovascular anomalies (e.g., arteriovenous mal￾formations) [2]. Use of 4D-DSA in the thorax and abdomen
has been limited primarily by its susceptibility to patient and
respiratory motion, a consequence of long data acquisition
times and the need for two rotational C-arm acquisitions.
Algorithms are being developed to correct for motion￾related image degradation during 4D-DSA acquisitions [3].
Improved motion correction will facilitate the use of 4D￾DSA during body interventions where characterization of
abnormal flow (arteriovenous malformations), flow reduction
(transarterial embolizations), or flow restoration (e.g., balloon
angioplasty/stent placement for arterial stenosis) is needed.
Angiographic endpoints for liver-directed therapies such
as transarterial embolization continue to be somewhat
subjective and variable among operators [4]. 4D-DSA can
provide quantitative information on blood flow and
velocity in a vascular volume by leveraging the inherent
pulsatility of arterial flow [5]. Quantitative 4D-DSA may
provide a better understanding of in vivo flow dynamics
during hepatic interventional procedures and facilitate the
development of rather objective angiographic endpoints.
For example, quantitative 4D-DSA was recently shown to
be a feasible modality for quantifying hepatic blood flow
and characterizing changes in flow during transarterial
embolization [6]. However, the quality of the 4D-DSA
reconstructions and resultant accuracy of the flow calcula￾tions was shown to be dependent on, and positively corre￾lated with, the strength of the contrast pulsatility [7].
Maximizing the strength of pulsatility while maintaining a
cross-sectional area with adequate filling would be ideal
for 4D-DSA acquisitions. However, data acquisition and
contrast injection parameters for 4D-DSA have yet to be
optimized to maximize the flow signal. Therefore, this
study aimed to investigate the effects of various imaging
and injection parameters on quantitative 4D-DSA acquisi￾tions of hepatic vasculature in an in vivo porcine model.
Methods
All procedures were approved by the institutional research
animal care and use committee and were compliant with
regulatory guidelines (protocol number M005606). Three
female Yorkshire cross domestic swine (mean weight, 54
kg) were sedated with an intramuscular administration of
7 mg/kg of tiletamine hydrochloride and zolazepam hydro￾chloride (Xyla-Ject, Phoenix Pharmaceutical, St. Joseph,
Missouri, USA), intubated endotracheally facilitated by
0.05 mg/kg atropine (Phoenix Pharmaceutical, Burlingame,
California, USA), and then underwent anesthesia induction
and maintenance with 2% inhaled isoflurane (Halocarbon
Laboratories, River Edge, New Jersey, USA). After being
anesthetized, subjects were placed supine on the bed of a
cone-beam computed tomography scanner (Artis Zee,
Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany). Arterial access
was obtained via a femoral arterial puncture. A vascular
sheath was placed, and a 4 Fr or 5 Fr angled glide catheter
was positioned in the common hepatic artery.
4D-DSA technique
As previously described [1, 2, 8–11], the 4D-DSA technique
consisted of two separate C-arm rotations: the first (mask)
rotation without contrast injection and the second (fill) rota￾tion that starts prior to the contrast injection to capture the
contrast inflow and time-resolved contrast kinetics. The 4D￾DSA images were acquired with 6- or 12-s rotation times
over an angular range of 260 degrees. Total data acquisition
times (including the mask and fill rotations as well as the
mid-acquisition C-arm reset) were 15 and 27 s for the 6-
and 12-s rotation times, respectively. Conventional 3D re￾construction was performed to generate a constraint volume
after the subtraction of mask and contrast-enhanced fill im￾ages. Time-resolved 3D image volumes corresponding to
each projection image in the contrast-enhanced rotation
were generated by performing constrained back-projection
and normalization operations [1].
The 4D-DSA acquisitions were performed with the
catheter positioned proximally in the common hepatic ar￾tery to allow adequate mixing of the contrast and blood as
well as to maintain an adequate vessel segment for flow
quantitation. Longer acquisition times provide more data
with an increased number of cardiac cycles for image re￾construction and flow quantitation; however, they are also
more prone to motion and expose the patient to a greater
amount of radiation and intravenous contrast. Therefore,
two frequently used acquisition times of 6 and 12 s were
investigated in this study. The duration of contrast injec￾tion was dependent on the duration of the 4D-DSA acqui￾sition. For 6-s and 12-s 4D-DSA acquisitions, 5.5-s and
11-s contrast injections were performed, respectively. The
contrast injections were started 0.5-1 s after the initiation
of the second gantry rotation in order to capture the
inflow of contrast. For all injection protocols, iohexol 300
mgI/mL (Omnipaque 300. General Electric Healthcare,
Waukesha, Wisconsin, USA) was used with a max pres￾sure of 800 pound-force per square inch (psi). To
minimize the motion-related artifacts in the reconstruc￾tion, 4D-DSA images were acquired with respiration
suspended. Image reconstruction (Fig. 1) was performed
using a 4D-DSA prototype provided by the manufacturer
(Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany).
Assessment of optimal acquisition parameters
Quantitative flow and velocity measurements can be
obtained using a previously validated 4D-DSA based
Meram et al. European Radiology Experimental (2020) 4:37 Page 2 of 10

algorithm described by Shaughnessy et al. [7]. This tech￾nique relies on a frequency-domain analysis of the pulsa￾tility of the time-attenuation curves as well as 3D
geometric information obtained from the iodine signal
[7]. Pulsatility refers to the temporal variation in image
intensity at each point along a vessel caused by temporal
variations in iodine concentration. These concentration
variations are a natural result of the mixing of injected
contrast agent with time-varying blood flow driven by
the cardiac cycle. In this study, 4D-DSA reconstructions
were processed using the above algorithm, which also
provides a sideband ratio (SBR) metric as a measure of
contrast pulsatility in 4D-DSA [7]. The SBR is a proxy
for the signal-to-noise ratio of the cardiac pulsatile
waveform, and, as such, is a major determinant of flow
quantification performance [7]. A higher SBR has been
associated with a higher correlation seen between 4D￾DSA and intravascular Doppler blood velocities [6].
Given that the objective of the study was to determine
factors improving the quality of 4D-DSA reconstructions
and flow quantitation, not to actually quantify hepatic
arterial flow in a porcine model, SBR, not blood velocity,
was the primary endpoint in the analysis.
Total of fifty-nine 4D-DSA examinations were acquired
in three subjects with varying injection and acquisition
protocols to understand the effect of following parameters
on SBR: imaging duration (6 or 12 s), injection rate (1.0–
2.5 mL/s), contrast concentration (50% or 100%), and
catheter size (4 Fr or 5 Fr). Fifty-nine 4D-DSA examina￾tions corresponded to a total of 299 data points in differ￾ent arterial segments, which included various
combinations of common hepatic (n = 59), gastroduode￾nal (n = 68), left hepatic (n = 59), left medial (n = 56), and
left lateral (n = 57) arteries depending on the specific anat￾omy of the individual subjects or limitations with segmen￾tation. Right hepatic arteries were not included as the
right-sided porcine hepatic arterial supply is more variable
and generally lacks a single dominant right hepatic artery.
Given the longer course of the gastroduodenal artery
without early bifurcation, for most of the acquisitions (n =
30), shorter and longer vessel segmentations were per￾formed for gastroduodenal artery while it could not be
segmented in 20 acquisitions.
The primary end point of this experiment was to as￾sess the signal strength of contrast pulsatility (i.e., the
SBR metric) with changing injection and acquisition

for any time frame or angle. The hepatic artery numbering is as follows: 1, common hepatic (1st order); 2, left hepatic (2nd order); 3, left medial
(3rd order); 4, left lateral (3rd order); and 5, gastroduodenal (2nd order)

parameters. Data points from different branches of the
common hepatic artery were grouped as first-order
(common hepatic), second-order (gastroduodenal or left
hepatic artery), and third-order (left medial or left lateral
artery) branches, and the SBR was evaluated accordingly
by taking into account the inherent difference that oc￾curs with branching distally.
Vessel cross-sectional area was selected as a secondary
comparison parameter to ensure adequate contrast fill￾ing within the vessel with high-quality anatomical detail
and accurate flow estimates with 4D-DSA. Therefore,
for all vessels in which values for SBR were obtained, the
average cross-sectional area was computed with a seg￾mentation algorithm using an automated full width at
half maximum approach at local centerline points along
the vessel. A segmentation algorithm was chosen to pre￾vent inter-rater differences that could arise with manual
segmentation methods. With the remaining parameters
being identical, the change in area from 1.0 to 2.5 mL/s
injection rate was evaluated to assess the adequacy of
filling.
The presence of reflux during injections was also
noted for each acquisition to understand the influence
of reflux on the SBR.
Statistical analysis
To estimate the effect of injection rate, scan time, con￾trast concentration, catheter size, and branch on SBR
(on the natural logarithm scale), a linear mixed model
was fit to the data using the ‘lme4’ package (V 1.1-1.15)
in R (3.4.3) [12]. The model was adjusted for each covar￾iate described above and allowed for interactive effects
between scan time and branch number while the indi￾vidual swine was modeled as a random effect to account
for the influence of inter-subject differences on the SBR.
Using likelihood ratio tests, it was found that two other
candidate models, one which allowed for an interaction
effect between injection rate and branch and one which

modeled injection rate as categorical factor, were found
to not fit the data significantly better than the model de￾scribed above (p = 0.929, p = 0.532).
A similar linear mixed model was also fit to analyze
the variance of 4D-DSA area. This model adjusted for
injection rate, scan time, contrast concentration, catheter
size, branch, and included an interaction between injec￾tion rate and branch. The individual swine was again
modeled as a random effect.
To analyze the effect of assessed reflux on SBR, the
linear mixed model described above was refit to the data
but with the inclusion of a reflux term. Observations
with inadvertent reflux induced via improper catheter
positioning or vasospasm around the catheter tip were
omitted prior to estimating the model. To assess the role
of injection rate, scan time, contrast concentration, cath￾eter size, and branch on reflux, a logistic regression
model (allowing for random effects) was estimated.
After estimating each model, 95% semi-parametrically
bootstrapped confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated
(2000 iterations) and approximate p values were calcu￾lated using Satterthwaite’s method as implemented in
the “lmerTest” package [13].
Results
Fifty-nine 4D-DSA acquisitions yielded a total of 299
data points. Two 4D-DSA acquisitions (ten data points)
were excluded from the analysis due to catheter dis￾placement into the celiac trunk during data acquisition.
The analyses were done using the remaining 289 data
points. Table 1 shows the types and total number of dif￾ferent parameters that were investigated in this study.
The distribution of all 289 data points consisting of
different combinations of injection rate, scan time,
contrast concentration, and catheter size for the first,
second, and third-order branches individually is shown
in Fig. 2. A clear trend is not immediately apparent from
Fig. 2 with multiple varying parameters. However, linear
mixed models that were fit to the data allowed to evalu￾ate the individual effects of investigated parameters. For
all linear mixed models, a graphical analysis of the over￾all model residuals revealed no departure from model
assumptions. The overall error, the within-group and
the random effects themselves were found to be nor￾mally distributed and homoscedastic.
Assessment of acquisition and injection parameters on
sideband ratio
The mean SBR values and the significance of effect of
different acquisition and injection parameters on SBR
were summarized in Table 2. As it is shown in Table 3
in further detail, 12-s acquisitions yielded a higher SBR
than 6-s acquisitions by a factor of 2.75 (95% CI 1.72–
4.35, p < 0.001) for the common hepatic artery. While
the difference between acquisition times was found to
be statistically significant in second-order branches (p <
0.0001), a significance was not observed in third-order
branches (p = 0.297). Compared to the common hep￾atic artery, SBR in the second-order and third-order
branches is estimated to be 61.4% (95% CI 37.8–79.5%,
p < 0.001) and 63.4% smaller (95% CI 77.2–39.7%, p <
0.001), respectively. Overall, a significantly lower SBR
was observed in more distal branches. This trend can
be seen in Fig. 3. For injection rate (mL/s), when the
estimate in log-scale is exponentiated, a one-unit

increase was found to be associated with a 19.6% de￾crease in SBR (95% CI 6.5–31.6%, p = 0.007). Neither
contrast concentration nor the catheter size were found
to be significantly associated with measured SBR (p =
0.907 and p = 0.063, respectively).
Assessment of 4D-DSA cross-sectional area for vessels
From the model fit to the 4D-DSA area data, it was
found that neither contrast concentration nor scan time
had a significant effect on estimated area (p = 0.633 and
p = 0.607, respectively). In Table 4, it can also be seen
that the rate of injection was positively correlated with
4D-DSA cross-sectional area for the common hepatic ar￾tery with an estimated increase in the area by 0.032 cm2
(95% CI 0.022–0.042, p < 0.001) per unit (1 mL/s) in￾crease in the injection rate. Figure 4 shows the observed
4D-DSA area for 4-Fr and 5-Fr catheter sizes with differ￾ent injection rates in first-, second-, and third-order
hepatic arterial branches. The model also found that
both the second- and third-order branches had signifi￾cantly lower cross-sectional areas compared to the
common hepatic artery (p = 0.007 and p < 0.001, re￾spectively). Finally, injections with a 5 Fr catheter were
found to have reduced area by an estimate of 0.008 cm2
(95% CI 0.002–0.014) (p = 0.009). In Fig. 5, the increase
in 4D-DSA area segmentation for increasing injection
rates with 12-s scan time, 4-Fr catheter size, and 100%
contrast concentration is shown.

Impact of reflux on sideband ratio
The reflux-adjusted model found no significant effect of
the presence of reflux on SBR (p = 0.087). Although re￾flux seems to be more detrimental for the SBR of acqui￾sitions with 6 s scan time than 12 s scan times (as seen
in Fig. 6), a model which included an interaction term
between reflux and scan time was found not to fit the
data significantly better (p = 0.106). When the effect of
experimental parameters on reflux were investigated
using logistic regression, it was found that increasing in￾jection rates (OR 2.59, 95% CI 1.32–5.26, p = 0.006) and
100% contrast (OR 4.56, 95% CI 2.14–10.30, p < 0.001)
resulted in more reflux while 5 Fr catheter (OR 0.09,
95% CI 0.01–0.22, p < 0.001) was associated with less
reflux. Scan time was found not to be significantly asso￾ciated with reflux (p = 0.677).
Discussion
Understanding baseline flow states and treatment￾related changes in flow is critical when determining if
flow-altering catheter-based treatments are indicated
and when desired therapeutic endpoints have been
reached. Angiographic techniques that are currently
used for treatment planning and assessing endpoints
provide anatomic and qualitative hemodynamic informa￾tion. However, given the relative ubiquity of C-arm
cone-beam computed tomography in interventional
suites, 4D-DSA may allow developing objective quanti￾tative physiological endpoints that can be measured and
may be easily adopted to interventional practices. This
study aimed to investigate the effects of different acquisi￾tion and injection parameters that could influence the
contrast pulsatility used for quantitation of flow using
4D-DSA images.
The study showed that both injection and data acquisi￾tion parameters significantly impact the SBR, which is
an estimate of the signal-to-noise and a major determin￾ant in the algorithm that is used for flow quantitation
with 4D-DSA. Longer data acquisitions led to higher
SBR, possibly due to an increase in the number of car￾diac cycles captured and a greater ability to detect the
pulsate frequencies captured in the contrast dynamics.

catheters led to a slightly higher 4D-DSA area across all branches

Given the significantly higher SBR achieved with longer
acquisitions, 12-s acquisitions are suggested for more
accurate flow quantitation. However, longer rotational
acquisitions are more susceptible to motion artifacts,
require larger contrast injections, and results in greater
radiation exposure [14]. Therefore, shorter acquisitions
may suffice and still be preferable in body parts associ￾ated with significant motion or in patients with impaired
renal function to minimize the volume of contrast
administered.
The study also showed that there were no significant
differences between 100% and 50% contrast concentra￾tion when all the other parameters were identical. This
means that using a contrast concentration of 50% is a
feasible option for reducing the amount of contrast used
during 4D-DSA acquisitions. An increase in the injection
rate was found to negatively impact the SBR, which was
observed to be more prominent in the common hepatic
artery and for 6-s acquisition time. This could be related
to the degree of mixing with higher injection rates, a
more turbulent flow near the catheter site, or the overall
lower SBR values seen with 6 s acquisition times.
Lastly, a larger cross-sectional area with better filling
was observed with higher injection rates. As the area is
an important component of flow rate, it is necessary to
ensure adequate filling in addition to obtaining a higher
SBR (i.e., flow signal) for accurate flow calculations.
Given the relatively lower SBRs and larger cross￾sectional areas seen with higher injection rates, using an
injection rate of 1.5–2.0 mL/s could prevent underfilling
while maintaining greater contrast pulsatility.
Reflux of contrast has been previously shown to im￾pact angiographic image quality [15, 16]. As a marker of
an excessive amount of contrast being injected, this
study also investigated the potential detrimental effects
of reflux on 4D-DSA reconstructions. The results dem￾onstrated that reflux occurred more frequently with
higher injection rates and 100% contrast concentration.
A 5-Fr catheter size was associated with less reflux
compared to a 4-Fr catheter, but the 5-Fr catheter also
resulted in lower SBR values. This may be due to the
smaller size of the porcine hepatic vessels; larger vessels
elsewhere in the porcine body or in humans may be able
to accommodate a larger catheter size than 4 Fr without
losing the contrast pulsatility. Although reflux did yield
data with lower SBRs, especially with 6-s acquisition
times, there were no statistically significant differences
in SBR of the acquisitions with or without reflux. The
trend toward a lower flow signal with reflux on shorter
acquisitions is likely related to insufficient filling given
the overall smaller volume of contrast used during
shorter acquisitions. A higher volume of contrast used
during longer acquisitions may be able to offset the
detrimental effect of reflux on flow signal by ensuring
adequate filling of distal branches. It should also be
noted that the catheter position might be important in
the occurrence of reflux as the more proximal position￾ing of the catheter tip in the common hepatic artery was
observed to reflux more frequently. However, if the flow
in the common hepatic artery is of interest, the tip of
the catheter should be positioned rather proximally to
allow adequate vessel length for contrast mixing and
vessel segmentation.
This study had several limitations. It was performed in
a porcine model using general anesthesia and breath￾holds during data acquisition. A porcine model was se￾lected because it is a commonly used model in interven￾tional research because of the similarity in size and

100% contrast concentration and 4-Fr catheter size). The final row

18]. Nonetheless, the results of this study need to be
validated in clinical patients. The use of general
anesthesia was necessary given the animal model, and
breath holds were performed because respiratory motion
severely degrades 4D-DSA reconstructions. Given many
liver-directed therapies in clinical patients are performed
under moderate sedation, it can be difficult to achieve ad￾equate breath holds in humans. The long data acquisition
during 4D-DSA further compounds this. These limitations
are being addressed by motion correction algorithms cur￾rently in development [3]. However, neither the impact of
respiratory motion on the 4D-DSA reconstructions, nor
the ability to correct for it were included in this study. Fi￾nally, this study used a pulsatility-based algorithm for flow
quantitation. This method may not be as accurate in
vessels with lower pulsatility (e.g., distal or post-stenotic
arterial branches or veins). However, other techniques not
relying on pulsatility (e.g., mean transit time) may be
employed in those circumstances.
In conclusion, this study investigated the effect of im￾aging and contrast injection parameters on the quality of
4D-DSA acquisitions in hepatic arteries using a porcine
model. Acquisition parameters significantly impacted
SBR, a measure of signal strength required for flow
quantitation with 4D-DSA. The strength of contrast
pulsatility can be optimized by adjusting the injection
rate and using longer acquisition times. Reduction of
contrast concentration to 50% is feasible to reduce the
amount of contrast administered during 4D-DSA acqui￾sitions. Reflux of contrast does not significantly hinder
contrast pulsatility. Further studies are warranted to in￾vestigate the applicability of the study results in different
organ systems and in clinical patients.
