Ultrafiltration for intractable ascites after liver
transplantation
G Noble-Jamieson, N Jamieson, N D Barnes
Abstract
A 57 year old boy with al-antitrypsin defi￾ciency developed intractable ascites after liver
transplantation. Conservative treatment was
unsuccessful and after 18 days concentrated
ascitic fluid was reinfused intravenously using
a Gambro haemofilter. The ascitic loss
resolved rapidly. This new method of ultrafi￾tration proved simple and effective.

Case report
Severe intractable ascites was the main indica￾tion for liver transplantation in a 5-7 year old
boy with a1-antitrypsin deficiency. After the
operation the ascites returned and massive
amounts were lost through the abdominal
drains from the fourth postoperative day. The
next day the serum bilirubin concentration and
alanine transaminase activity rose and ultra￾sound Doppler demonstrated poor hepatic com￾pliance. These are all indications of possible
acute rejection.
A liver biopsy specimen confirmed moder￾ately severe rejection and treatment with high
dose intravenous methylprednisolone was-given
for three days. There was a rapid response with

the liver function tests returning to normal
within seven days. The ascitic fluid losses,
however, increased to a maximum of 10 I/day.
The fluid lost was a sterile exudate which
contained 39 g/l of protein. Repeated examina￾tions with ultrasound Doppler excluded
obstruction of the inferior vena cava and the
hepatic and portal venous systems. Despite
massive replacement with blood products the
protein loss caused a severe coagulopathy (fig
1). From the 11th day all ascitic fluid loss was
reinfused intravenously. This rapidly corrected
the coagulopathy but the volume of ascites
remained the same (fig 1).
After 18 days it was decided to concentrate
the ascitic fluid using a Gambro Haemofilter
FH22 (Gambro Dialysatoren) before reinfusion.
In a closed circuit the ascitic fluid was drained
through a peritoneal catheter, then pumped
across the haemofilter membrane. The protein
concentrate was then reinfused through a blood
transfusion filter (Pall) into a femoral vein (fig
2). The volumetric infusion pump (IMED) was
set at a rate between 100 and 600 ml/hour,
starting with a high rate initially while the
abdomen was grossly distended and decreasing
as the abdominal girth diminished. The filtrate,
which varied in volume from 100 to 150 ml/
hour, was discarded. The haemofilter was
perfused with heparin at a dose of 100 units/
hour to prevent blockage of the filter and clot
formation in the ascitic fluid. No prophylactic
antibiotic treatment was used and ascitic fluid
sent daily for culture remained sterile. Tran￾sient hyponatraemia and oliguria occurred on
the third day of the procedure but the serum
urea and creatinine concentrations remained
stable. After six days the abdominal girth had
decreased from 80 cm to 65 cm and ultrafitra￾tion was stopped. Subsequently there was only
slight ascitic drainage, and this ceased entirely
after two days.

Ultrafiltraton for intractabk ascites after liver transplantation 989
Discussion
In liver cirrhosis ascites formation is a consequ￾ence of progressive intrahepatic venous obstruc￾tion,* leading to a rise in intrasinusoidal pressure
and increased hepatic lymph production.'
Another important mechanism is the hyperal￾dosteronism and urinary sodium retention
which occurs in response to the depletion of the
vascular space.' 2 Even when there has been
gross ascites preoperatively it generally resolves
promptly after successful liver transplantation.
Among 120 recipients of paediatric liver trans￾plant, only three children have developed severe
postoperative ascites, on each occasion in asso￾ciation with acute graft rejection. Ultrasound
Doppler studies have proved extremely useful
in the early diagnosis of acute rejection by
demonstrating a reduction in hepatic venous
pulsatility, indicating a swollen and non￾compliant liver.3 These changes reflect reduced
hepatic venous outflow and ascites formation
may follow. Depletion of the intravascular space
leads to renin, angiotensin, and aldosterone
secretion and so to urinary sodium retention.
This secondary hyperaldosteronism probably
contributes to prolonged ascitic loss even after a
rejection episode had resolved. It seems prob￾able also that the severe preoperative ascites
may have opened channels for ascitic fluid
production.
Thus the rapid development of ascites after
liver transplantation may indicate the onset of
acute graft rejection. When venous obstruction
has been excluded a liver biopsy is needed.
Management should include control of the
rejection and treatment of the ascites. Replace￾ment of large volumes of plasma proteins may
be required to replenish the intravascular
volume, to maintain normal coagulation, and to
maintain humoral immunity. Diuretics, espe￾cially aldosterone antagonists such as spirono￾lactone, are usually given to counteract the
secondary hyperaldosteronism. When these
forms of treatment prove inadequate it seems
logical to replace the ascitic fluid loss, and
various methods of reinfusion and ultrafiltration
have been described.' The ultrafiltration
device most commonly described has been the
Rodiascit system, which allows continuous
ultrafiltration and reinfusion of the concen￾trated ascites. We used a less complicated and
more readily available method for ultrafiltration
of ascites. Continuous arteriovenous haemofil￾tration is a well established technique and is
frequently used for patients with oliguria and
fluid overload. The haemofilter removes water
and crystalloids with a molecular weight below
15 000. Filtration is usually driven by arterial
pressure alone but can be enhanced by a pump
and this was of course needed to circulate the
ascitic fluid. By recycling the ascites in this way
protein losses were avoided and the clotting
deficit was rapidly corrected. Immunoglobulins
and complement are also lost in ascitic fluid and
their retention reduces the risk of infection. To
our knowledge this method of ultrafiltration of
ascites has not been used before and it proved
remarkably simple, practical, and effective.
We thank the nursing staff of the paediatric intensive care unit
for their technical advice and expertise in caring for this patient.
