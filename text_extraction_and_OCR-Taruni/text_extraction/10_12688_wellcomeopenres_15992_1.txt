Abstract
Background: Tenofovir (TFV) is a widely used treatment for chronic
hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. There is a high genetic barrier to the
selection of TFV resistance-associated mutations (RAMs), but the
distribution and clinical significance of TFV RAMs are not well
understood. We here present assimilated evidence for putative TFV
RAMs with the aims of cataloguing and characterising mutations that
have been reported, and starting to develop insights into mechanisms
of resistance.
Methods: We carried out a systematic literature search in PubMed
and Scopus to identify clinical, in vitro and in silico evidence of TFV
resistance. We included peer-reviewed studies presenting original
data regarding virological TFV breakthrough, using published
methods to assess the quality of each study. We generated a list of
RAMs that have been reported in association with TFV resistance,
developing a ‘long-list’ (all reported RAMs) and a ‘short-list’ (a refined
list supported by the most robust evidence). We assessed the
potential functional and structural consequences by mapping onto the
crystal structure for HIV reverse transcriptase (RT), as the structure of
HBV RT has not been solved.

Results: We identified a ‘long-list’ of 37 putative TFV RAMs in HBV RT,
occurring within and outside sites of enzyme activity, some of which
can be mapped onto a homologous HIV RT structure. A ‘short-list’ of
nine sites are supported by the most robust evidence. If clinically
significant resistance arises, it is most likely to be in the context of
suites of multiple RAMs. Other factors including adherence, viral load,
HBeAg status, HIV coinfection and NA dosage may also influence
viraemic suppression.
Conclusion: There is emerging evidence for polymorphisms that may
reduce susceptibility to TVF. However, good correlation between viral
sequence and treatment outcomes is currently lacking; further studies
are essential to optimise individual treatment and public health
approaches.

Introduction
Nucleot(s)ide analogues (NA) are the most widely used antivi￾ral treatments for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection1
, 
with tenofovir (TFV) being a safe, cheap, and widely available 
agent. NA agents inhibit the action of HBV reverse transcriptase 
(RT), acting as DNA chain terminators. NA therapy can be 
effective in suppressing HBV viraemia, thus reducing the risks 
of inflammation, fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
as well as lowering the risk of transmission1
. However, NAs are 
not curative due to the persistent intracellular hepatic reservoir 
of HBV covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). Long-term 
administration is therefore typically required2
, with a poten￾tial risk of selection of resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) 
in the virus3,4
. RAMs are mostly likely to arise in the context 
of high viral replication, arising as a result of the error prone 
RT enzyme1
.
Lamivudine (3TC), telbivudine (LdT) and adefovir (ADV) 
have been phased out of use in HBV management, mainly 
due to the predictable selection of RAMs over time1
. The best 
recognised 3TC RAM arises at RT-M204, representing the 
second position of the tyrosine-methionine-aspartate-aspartate 
(‘YMDD’) motif in viral RT1,4
. Resistance to TFV, formulated
either as tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) or tenofovir 
alafenamide (TAF) (Suppl Fig 1, Extended data5
), remains 
controversial. Unlike other NAs, TFV has a high genetic barrier 
to resistance1
, corroborated by studies that report no resistance 
after many years of treatment6
. An on-line tool, ‘geno2pheno hbv’, 
lists only one position (RT N236T) in association with 
reduced TFV susceptibility, while other reports also include 
A181T/V7
. However, there are emerging reports of a wider range 
of amino acid substitutions that are associated with reduced 
TFV sensitivity, described in both treatment-experienced and 
treatment-naïve individuals with chronic HBV infection 
(CHB)8,9
.
There is some degree of homology between the sequence, struc￾ture and function of HIV and HBV RT enzymes, explaining 
why certain NAs are active against both viruses10. Although no 
crystal structure has been resolved for HBV RT, some studies 
have modelled this enzyme based on the HIV crystal structure10–12, 
suggesting that insights into HBV drug resistance mechanisms 
might be inferred from what is known about HIV.
A better understanding of the role of NA therapy in driving 
HBV elimination at a population level is crucial to underpin 
efforts to move towards international targets for elimination by 
the year 20303,13. For populations in which HIV and HBV are 
both endemic, as exemplified by many settings in sub-Saharan
Africa, there are particular concerns about drug resistance in 
HBV, given the widespread population exposure to TDF as a 
component of first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV3
. In 
order to progress towards these targets, many more people will 
need to be treated in the decade ahead.
We have therefore undertaken a systematic approach to assimi￾late the current evidence for the development of clinical or 
virological HBV breakthrough during TFV therapy. The evidence
on this topic is not currently sufficiently advanced to under￾pin definitive conclusions regarding specific genetic signatures 
that underpin TVF resistance, or the extent to which these are 
significant in clinical practice. However, we add to the field 
by providing a comprehensive summary of relevant publications, 
together with a quality appraisal of the evidence. We used this 
process to assimilate a ‘long-list’ (all putative TFV RAMs) 
and a ‘short-list’ (a refined catalogue containing only the poly￾morphisms most robustly supported by existing data). We 
highlight gaps in the existing data and the urgent need for 
more research.
Methods
Search strategy and quality appraisal
We undertook a systematic search of PubMed and Scopus in 
February 2019, using PRISMA criteria (Suppl Fig 2, Extended 
data5
). Data extraction was performed independently using the 
search terms (“Hepatitis B virus” [Mesh] OR “hepatitis b” 
OR HBV) AND (Tenofovir OR TDF OR TAF OR “Tenofo￾vir alafenamide” OR “Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate”) AND
(resista* OR drug muta* OR DRMs OR RAMs OR viremia OR 
replica*). We reviewed the titles and abstracts matching the 
search terms and included those reporting virological HBV 
breakthrough after exposure to TFV, only including studies
that presented original data and had undergone peer review. 
All retrieved articles were in English, therefore no exclusion
in relation to language was required. For each study, we 
extracted information on type of study, characteristics of study 
participants, sequencing method, genotype, HBV treatment 
used, mutations associated with TFV resistance and method used 
to define TFV resistance. We used the Joanna Briggs Institute 
Critical Appraisal tool checklist to assess for quality of case 
reports14. For assessment of quantitative studies, we used the 
BMJ adapted Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies15.
Appraisal of putative sites of drug resistance
Recognising that there is sparse and varied evidence to 
support TDF RAMs, we divided our data into two categories. 
First, we generated a ‘long list’ of all polymorphisms that have 
been reported in association with TFV resistance, to summa￾rise all the available data in the most inclusive way. We then 
refined this into a ‘short list’ including just those sites supported 
by the most robust evidence, based on reporting in ≥2 studies 
and a combination of in vivo and in vitro evidence.
Sequence analysis
To assess similarity between HIV and HBV RT, we downloaded 
HIV (HXB2 - K03455); and HBV reference sequences (Geno

A – FJ692557, Geno B - GU815637, Geno C – GQ377617, 
Geno D - KC875277, Geno E - GQ161817) from publicly 
available repositories: HIV sequence database16 and Hepatitis B 
Virus Database17. We aligned amino acid RT sequences using 
MAFFT version 718. The alignment illustrates regions of simi￾larity and differences between HIV and HBV RT. We obtained 
RAMs associated with HIV resistance to TFV published in the 
Stanford University HIV drug resistance database under drug 
resistance summaries for nucleoside RT inhibitors.19.
Structural analysis
The crystal structure for HBV RT has not been solved, However, 
the enzyme is homologous to HIV RT. In order to further assess
the relevance of sites included in a ‘long list’ of all polymor￾phisms, we therefore considered evidence for a mechanistic 
influence by mapping HBV RAMs onto a previously solved 
crystal structure of HIV RT (Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 
3dlk)
20 using ICM-Pro platform, which provides a direct link to 
the PDB21
Results
Nature and quality of the evidence identified
We identified 15 studies that met our search criteria. Although 
some studies used hybrid methods, we classified them broadly 
as seven studies arising from clinical case reports8,9,22–26, (one 
of these also presented in vitro evidence for drug resistance9
), 
four from in vitro studies27–29 and four from longitudinal stud￾ies of CHB (with or without HIV coinfection)30–33. Studies were 
from Asia8,9,22,24,29, Australia33, Europe23,26,28,30–32 and USA25,27,34. 
Despite the high prevalence of HBV infection in Africa, and 
the widespread use of TFV for HIV across this continent, it 
is striking that no African data have been published to date. 
Eight studies reported HBV genotypes, representing genotypes 
A-G9,22,25–27,30–32,34. Metadata for individual studies are provided 
in Suppl Table 1 (see Extended data5
). 
A detailed quality assessment of each individual reference is 
included in Suppl Table 2 (see Extended data5
). Among the case 
reports, three were of high quality as they clearly described 
patients’ characteristics, clinical details, diagnosis, treatment 
and follow-up, and concluded with take away lessons22–24. Three 
further case reports did not describe diagnostic or assessment 
methods8,25,26, and one study did not describe post-intervention 
follow-up9
. The overall quality rating for four cohort studies
was strong because participants selected represented the target
population, characteristics of participants were clearly described, 
there was a clear hypothesis for the study, and inclusion/
exclusion criteria were specified30–33. Two studies had a weak 
rating because there was no description of the characteristics 
of participants and it was not clear to what extent participants 
were representative of the target population27,34. Two natural experi￾mental studies were not rated because the quality assessment 
questions were not applicable28,29.
Approach to defining resistance
Resistance was studied based on exposure to TDF in 13 
studies and TAF in two studies; we therefore refer to TFV 
throughout the results section. TFV resistance was determined 
using a range of strategies, which can be summarised as follows: 
 i A sequencing approach to identifying possible RAMs 
in HBV sequence isolated individuals in whom virae￾mia was not suppressed by TFV therapy, undertaken in 
seven studies8,22,24–26,30,33;
 ii In vitro assays to measure the effect of TFV on viral 
replication in cell lines, reported by three studies27,28,34;
iii Approaches (i) and (ii) in combination, applied in 
four studies9,23,31,32;
iv Approach (ii) combined with an animal model, 
described by one study29.
In 12/15 studies, HBV mutations were reported in associa￾tion with TFV resistance (suggesting complete virologic escape 
from the impact of a drug) or reduced TFV susceptibility 
(evidenced by incomplete suppression of viraemia, but not 
complete drug resistance)9,22,23,26–32,34. In the remaining three 
studies, persistent viraemia was reported among individuals 
with chronic HBV infection while on TFV but either no RAMs 
were identified25,33 or viral sequencing was not performed due 
to low viral load24.
Location and number of RAMs associated with TFV 
resistance
We generated a ‘long-list’ of 37 different sites of polymorphism, 
arising both within (n=15) and outside (n=22) enzymatically 
active sites in RT (Figure 1; Suppl Table 3, Extended data5
). 
HBV mutations outside active sites of the enzyme occurred in 
combination with RAMs located within active sites, with the 
exception of A194T. Only two studies reported TFV resistance
arising from the selection of a single mutation, S78T and 
A194T23,28. S78T was defined by sequencing HBV from two 
individuals in whom viraemia was not suppressed by TDF, 
combined with in vitro assays23, while A194T was only defined 
in vitro28. In all other studies, ≥2 RAMs were required to confer 
TFV resistance (2 RAMs in four studies27,29,30,34, 3 RAMs in one 
study32, 5 RAMs in one study9
, and ≥8 RAMs in a further four 
studies8,22,26,31). This pattern supports the high genetic barrier to 
selection of TFV resistance.
We narrowed the list of 37 sites down to compile a ‘short-list’ 
of TFV RAMs that have been identified in ≥2 studies, regarding 
these sites as having the strongest evidence base (nine sites; 
Table 1). The most frequently described RAMs were L180M22,31,32, 
A181T/V27,30,31,34, M204I/V9,22,31,32, and N236T27,30,34, which were 
all identified through sequencing and tested in in vitro assays 
to measure the effect of TDF on viral replication in cell lines. 
Among these, the M204 mutation (within the ‘YMDD’ motif) is 
well established in association with 3TC resistance, commonly 
arising in combination with substitutions at positions V173, 
L180 and A181, while N236 substitutions appear to be more 
specifically associated with reduced susceptibility to ADV and 
TFV7
. Mutations at sites 177, 194 and 249 may also be more

(orange table) or outside active sites (green table). The sites shown in bold represent the nine mutations in our short-list with best literature 
support (evidence summarised in Table 1). Note that in most cases, individual mutations are unlikely to be sufficient to mediate resistance, 
and a resistant phenotype arises only as a result of combinations of ≥2 polymorphisms. TFV, tenofovir; HBV, hepatitis B virus; RT, reverse

specific to TFV resistance, having been less clearly reported in 
association with resistance to other agents3,35. Polymorphisms
at positions 80, 173 and 184 have been described as 
compensatory changes to allow the virus to accommodate the 
primary drug escape substitution7
. These mutations on their 
own may not be sufficient to mediate TVF resistance but may 
be a necessary compensatory contribution to combinations of 
mutations that underpin resistance.
Some reported polymorphisms associated with drug resistance
represent wild type sequence in some genotypes (Y9H, 
F122L, H126Y, R153W/Q, F221Y, S223A, C256S, D263E, 
V278IV and A317S), and our assimilation shows more 
resistance in genotype D (Suppl Table 4, Extended data5
). 
Most of these polymorphisms are located outside the active site 
of the enzyme, with the exception of position 256. The 
barrier to selection of TFV resistance may therefore be lower 
in certain genotypes, (Figure 1; Suppl Table 4, Extended 
data5
). The same phenomenon has been described for HCV 
resistance, in which certain sub genotypes are predicted to be 
intrinsically resistant to certain direct acting antiviral agents due 
to the presence of resistance associated polymorphisms in the 
wild type sequence36,37.
One study assessed the replication competence and suscep￾tibility to TFV of mutated HBV clones in vitro and in vivo
using mice models. The introduction of P177G and F249A 
mutations (substitutions in active sites of the RT enzyme) in 
HBV clones resulted in a reduction in their susceptibility to 
TFV29.
RAMs occurring as minor quasispecies
There is limited evidence for the significance of TFV RAMs 
occurring as minor quasispecies. One study that performed 
ultra-deep pyrosequencing enrolled HIV/HBV co-infected 
individuals on (or about to start) TFV-containing ART, reporting 
minor variants present at <20% with mutations (V173, L180M, 
A181T/V and M204V) in 2/50 TFV naïve samples and 1/14 
sample obtained from a TDF-experienced individual33. One 
other study performed deep sequencing using Illumina on HBV 
clones9
, revealing that RAMs S106C, H126Y, D134E, M204I/V 
& L269I were predominant. Only one study reported sequencing
the whole HBV genome, but this was undertaken following 
in vitro introduction of RAMs into a clinically isolated virus34, 
so does not provide any evidence of the association between 
TFV RAMs and other polymorphisms that might arise on the 
same viral haplotype.

Duration of therapy and treatment compliance prior to 
detection of tenofovir resistance
Five studies reported the duration in which individuals
were on TFV prior to treatment failure, with virological 
breakthrough occurring between 48 weeks and 48 months of 
therapy (48 weeks22, 18 months24, 20 months31, 26 months9
, 
and 48 months8,23). Compliance was assessed in six studies, 
among which virological breakthrough despite good treatment 
compliance was reported in five9,22,24,31,32, and one reported 
concerns with compliance26. Quantification of drug levels in 
plasma supported good compliance in two studies9,31.
Comparison between HIV and HBV RT
HBV RT has been classified into subdomains which are further
divided into regions A – G38, which form the main catalytic 
core of the enzyme (Figure 1). Alignment of sequences of HBV 
and HIV RT demonstrates 25-27% homology between HBV 
and the HXB2 HIV reference sequence (Figure 2). Comparing
sites that have been reported in association with drug 
resistance in HBV vs HIV (Figure 3; Suppl Table 5, Extended 
data5
), we found that among our long-list of 37 HBV RAMs, 
two sites had identical substitutions in HIV RT (M204 and 
L229 in HBV10,12, corresponding to M184 and L210 in HIV, 
respectively; Stanford University HIV drug resistance database;
Figure 3). Other sites reporting an association with TVF 
resistance in HBV have substitutions that overlap with HIV 
RAMs, but not all of these are associated with TFV resistance 
(Suppl Table 6, Extended data5
).
Six established TFV RAMs in HIV RT (M41L, K65R, K70E, 
Y115F, Q151M and T215F/Y)19 do not correspond to an 
equivalent mutation in HBV RT, although three of these HIV 
RAMs have an HBV RAM within three amino acids up- or 
down-stream in the equivalent sequence, suggesting there may 
be homology in the mechanism through which drug resistance is 
mediated.

We mapped HBV RAMs onto the crystal structure of the likely 
structurally-related HIV RT (PDB code 3dlk) in order to visual￾ise their approximate 3D locations and infer possible functional 
consequences (Figure 4; Suppl Table 6, Extended data5
). The 
RAMs are primarily located within the ‘fingers’, ‘palm’, ‘thumb’ 
and ‘connection’ subdomains of the p66 polymerase domain 
of HIV RT, with the majority within the ‘palm’. A number of 
RAMs (e.g. V207, M204, F249) are spatially adjacent to the 
catalytically critical (and highly conserved) residues D110, 
D185 and D186 in HIV RT (D83, D204 and D205 in HBV), 
suggesting that these RAMs are highly likely to affect 
catalytic competency. The 22 HBV RAMs that map to HIV RT 
residue positions are likely to cause polymerase structure 
destabilisation if mutated, suggesting that many of these RAMs 
are likely to impact upon resistance.
Discussion
Summary of key findings
TFV is a safe and effective treatment choice for CHB in the 
majority of cases, and large case series have not raised significant 
concerns about clinically significant drug resistance. However, 
it is important to consider the potential for the emergence of 
resistance, demonstrated by persistent viraemia on therapy 
and/or reduced virologic suppression in vitro. Based on existing 
evidence, TFV resistance seems likely to depend on the selec￾tion of suites of mutations (most commonly including L180M, 
A181V/T, M204I/V and/or N236T), overlapping with RAMs that 
allow escape from other NA drugs. There is also a suggestion
that, rarely, single mutations can confer TFV resistance, best 
demonstrated for S78T.
Notably, the literature to date is limited and heterogenous, 
and there remains a lack of evidence about the frequency and 
likely impact of proposed TFV RAMs, either within individual
patients or at population level. At present, we have tackled 
this uncertainty by dividing our catalogue of polymorphisms 
into a ‘long-list’ (all reported RAMs) and a ‘short-list’ (RAMs 
with the best evidence-base of support).
Tools that have been designed to identify drug resistance may 
bias against detection of relevant mutations if they do not 
scrutinise all relevant sites that contribute to reducing TFV 
susceptibility. For example, ‘TRUGENE’ a commercially 
available HBV drug resistance interpretation system, captures 
Figure 4. Cartoon to show the sites of TFV drug resistance polymorphisms, using the homologous crystal structure of HIV RT 
as a model. The sequence alignment of HBV was extended with HIV RT’s p66 domain and then projected onto a high-resolution HIV RT 
structure (PDB code 3dlk). Sub-domains of the HIV RT are coloured and annotated. Positions associated with resistance are scattered 
primarily throughout the finger and palm subdomains of the p66 domain (purple space-filled representations, left whole-molecule view, 
purple stick representation on the zoomed in view on the right). Three aspartate residues, D83, D205 and D206 (indicated by grey space￾filled representation) form the catalytic triad of the enzyme and are shown as a point of reference. Of the 37 sites identified as potential TFV 
RAMs, 24 residues which are visible in the structure are labelled (using HBV numbering). This excludes seven putative HBV mutations at 
sites which do not have a homologous site in the HIV structure (sites 78, 80, 130, 134, 153, 163 and 256), and six sites which are beyond the 
end of the sequence of the solved crystal HIV structure (267, 269, 278, 317, 333 and 337). Figure produced using the ICM platform. Note 
that in most cases, individual mutations are unlikely to be sufficient to mediate resistance, and a resistant phenotype arises only as a result 
of combinations of ≥2 polymorphisms. HBV, hepatitis B virus; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; RAM, resistance-associated mutation; RT,

common HBV RAMs but does not include positions 78, 
177, or 249 which may be pertinent to TFV resistance39 and 
‘geno2pheno hbv’ only lists one TFV mutation at position 236.
Overlap of TFV RAMs with RAMs to other NA agents
RAMs L180M, M204I/V and A181T/V have been associ￾ated with resistance to 3TC, telbivudine (LdT) and entecavir 
(ETV)3,40–43; their reported association with TFV resistance is of 
concern in suggesting that prior NA exposure can increase the 
likelihood of cross-resistance to TFV. A study of HIV/HBV 
co-infected individuals demonstrated a decreased likelihood of 
HBV DNA suppression with TDF among individuals exposed 
to prolonged 3TC treatment, possibly due to accumulation of 
such mutations44. A large study in China reported A181 and/
or N236 substitutions in 11% of the population42, which may 
underpin reduced susceptibility to TFV. The structural similari￾ties between ADV and TFV, and similar interaction with HBV 
polymerase1,2
 explain why the ADV RAMs A181T/V and 
N236T are also reported to confer resistance to TFV1,45.
Although TFV has been considered effective in the context 
of resistance to other NAs46, the current evidence suggests 
that there may be common pathways to resistance47. There 
is some evidence showing co-location of RAMs conferring
resistance to different antiviral agents on the same viral 
haplotype48. These findings suggesting cross-resistance are of 
concern, especially for settings in which there has been 
widespread use of NA therapy as a component of ART for HIV3
.
Sites of TFV RAMs in HBV RT
Resistance to TFV can be explained by RAMs both within and 
outside the active site of the RT enzyme, some of which may 
have similar mechanisms to those described in HIV10,38. The 
mechanism of resistance in most of these polymorphisms 
remains unknown, but may interfere with drug access to sites of 
activity through steric hindrance. Mutations within active sites 
of the enzyme may be associated with a higher fitness cost to 
the virus than mutations at other locations in the RT sequence, 
as they are more likely to interfere with the RT function. 
Some polymorphisms listed as RAMs may in fact represent 
compensatory mutations, which are co-selected in the pres￾ence of primary RAMs. For example, substitution at position 
269 has been previously described as a compensatory mutation 
that restores impairments to RT function49.
Currently, HBV genotyping is not routinely undertaken in clini￾cal practice, so it is difficult to amass data for any potential 
relationship between resistance and viral genotype. However, 
there are some clues that genotype may be relevant. For example, 
C256S has been linked to TFV resistance, but S256 is wild type 
in genotype C (Suppl Table 4, Extended data5
), suggesting 
that the genetic barrier to TFV resistance in genotype C might 
be lower than in other genotypes. However, a study of >1000 
individuals in China found no differences in drug resistance 
rates between genotype B vs genotype C infection42. The 
identification of Y9H as a TFV RAM should be viewed with 
caution as H9 is frequently the wildtype residue, irrespective 
of genotype.
Other factors associated with persistent vireamia
In addition to RAMs, there are other explanations for incom￾plete suppression of HBV viraemia on therapy25,33, including 
a higher baseline HBV DNA level, positive baseline HBeAg 
status, history of 3TC exposure, a lower nadir CD4+ T cell count 
in the context of HIV coinfection, and high serum HBV RNA 
levels44,50,51. Given that HBV DNA is inhibited in a dose￾dependent manner2
, it is also possible that insufficient drug 
delivery to the infected hepatocyte could be the cause of 
persistent viraemia even in the absence of specific RAMs.
Incomplete adherence to therapy can also contribute to 
virological breakthrough52. Two studies included in our review 
assessed treatment compliance by measuring drug concentra￾tion in plasma9,31. Assessment of adherence in chronic HBV 
has been through the use of questionnaires53, but these are 
subject to self-reporting bias. Evidence of potential TFV resist￾ance may emerge when individuals with HIV/HBV coinfection 
are treated with a TFV-containing regimen leading to suppression 
of HIV but with sustained HBV vireamia54.
It has been reported to take three years for 90% of HBV infected 
individuals to reach viraemic suppression on therapy55, in 
contrast to HIV, in which 88% of patients suppress the virus 
within the first year of TDF-based treatment56. In the studies
we have reported in this review, persistent HBV viraemia on 
therapy could be due to the prolonged timeline for viraemic 
suppression; however, in most studies there was a reduction in 
viral load when TDF was initiated, with subsequent virological 
breakthrough that is more in keeping with the selection of 
resistance.
Implications for patient management
There are not currently sufficient data about TFV RAMs to 
underpin robust universal guidelines for clinical practice. How￾ever, the evidence that we have gathered here can underpin some 
practical recommendations:
i There is an urgent need for more HBV sequencing data, 
together with contemporaneous viral load measure￾ments and clinical metadata to advance understanding of 
the relationship between viral sequence and treatment 
outcomes. Sequence repositories, databases and tools for 
sequence analysis should regularly review the evidence 
for TDF RAMs in order to highlight all sites that may 
be significant in mediating resistance. 
ii In the context of failure of viraemic suppression in a 
patient prescribed therapy, assessing and supporting 
drug compliance is crucial, ideally together with viral 
sequencing.
iii Therapeutic failure of TFV – whether in the presence 
or absence of known RAMs – should lead to an expert 
clinical decision about switching therapy or combin￾ing agents, as long as adherence has been optimised and 
supported. The presence of recognised RAMs, espe￾cially when in combination, may support a change of 
therapy, considering ETV or combination therapy, 
although guidance and options are currently limited.

iv If there is an ongoing emergence of data to suggest 
TFV resistance, there will be a need for expert guide￾lines to include practical recommendations in order to 
unify clinical approaches. HIV guidelines should take 
an active stance on incorporating recommendations for 
those with HBV co-infection, particularly if dual therapy 
regimens are adopted.
v Evidence of TFV resistance highlights the need for 
development of robust novel direct acting antivirals and 
immune therapies for HBV.
Caveats and limitations
There is sparse literature on HBV resistance to TFV, and stud￾ies are of varying quality. While there is a high genetic barrier to 
selection of TFV resistance, it is likely that there is under-reporting 
of cases of resistance, particularly in low/middle income set￾tings in which routine monitoring of HBV viral load on treatment 
is not undertaken. It can be difficult to infer the impact of 
common polymorphisms on drug resistance phenotype; for 
example, it is plausible that M204I/V may be enriched among 
TFV resistant strains simply as a ‘footprint’ of prior exposure 
to 3TC.
Most studies to date have used Sanger sequencing, and it 
is possible that significant minority variants may be under￾represented, as suggested by one report in which phenotypic 
TFV resistance was associated with RAMs in <20% of minor 
variants33. Low HBV DNA viral loads are a further barrier 
to sequencing, and bias existing data towards samples from 
individuals with high viral loads, in which the full spectrum of 
relevant RAMs may not occur. It is therefore important to invest 
in deep sequencing platforms that offer the opportunity to explore 
the full landscape of HBV variants isolated from an infected 
individual, and to improve sensitivity of sequencing methods 
including both Sanger and ‘next-generation’ approaches. Some 
sequencing methods, such as Oxford Nanopore Technologies, 
can generate long reads that allow reconstruction of complete 
viral haplotypes, providing improved certainty about linkages 
between sites57. To be able to undertake an appropriate 
haplotypes analysis, datasets with robustly phenotyped patients 
(displaying clinical evidence of drug resistance), together 
with full length viral sequence data, would be required; such 
datasets have not been generated to date but are an important 
long-term aim.
We recognise the limitations of drawing direct comparisons 
between HIV and HBV RT, given the limited (<30%) sequence 
homology between the two enzymes, and the finding that 
only 2/37 sites associated with TVF resistance in HBV are 
homologous RAMs in HIV. This highlights a need for future 
work to solve the crystal structure of HBV RT.
Conclusions
We have assimilated emerging evidence for HBV polymor￾phisms that reduce susceptibility to TFV, also acknowledging 
the potential influences of other viral and host factors in cases 
of persistent viraemia on therapy. While the genetic barrier to 
resistance is high, evidenced by the large number of mutations 
that typically have to be selected to produce resistance, of con￾cern is the overlap with other NA resistance mutations, and the 
instances in which individual amino acid polymorphisms may 
be sufficient to produce phenotypic resistance. Enhanced studies 
representing larger numbers of patients, tracking longitudinal 
viral sequence changes, and monitoring viral suppression over 
time are needed. In addition, the evolution of better in vitro
models will support experiments to investigate the effect of indi￾vidual and combined RAMs. In order to optimise the use of 
NA therapy as a tool in driving advancements towards elimina￾tion at a population level, improved insights into drug resistance 
are essential. If resistance emerges as a substantial clinical 
problem, there will be a need for consideration of synergistic drug 
regimens, new agents that inhibit a target other than viral RT, 
and for the development of new therapeutic strategies that can 
bring about cure.

This is an excellent systematic review on clinical, in vitro and in silico TNF resistance. The authors
reviewed and listed polymorphisms associated to TNF resistance and analyzed the existence of
polymorphisms according to HBV genotypes. In addition, compared the polymorphisms in the
HBV and HIV RT gene sequence alignments.
Comments:
Figure 1. The green box is named within active site? Is it correct? Please verify.
Figure 1. As mentioned by the authors in the text, polymorphisms at position 80, 173 and 184 are
described as compensatory changes, therefore the title “RAMs associated with TDF/TAF …” this
could mislead the readers to believe they are all confirmed resistant mutations.
The urgent need for more HBV sequencing data is important for research and better
understanding of the topic; however, it is important to first check patient adherence to treatment
(feasible and lower cost) and then look for RAMs. Therefore, I would suggest to change position of
item “i” There is urgent need for more HBV sequencing… with item “ii”

This is an excellent systematic review. There is still however limited data regarding HBV primary
resistance against TFV or TFV. The data is even sparse in low/middle income settings such as sub
Saharan Africa where routine monitoring of HBV viral load on treatment is rarely undertaken
despite high usage of TFV as part of HIV/AIDS management. While some resistance mutations
have been reported, phenotypic studies are lacking regarding primary TFV resistance mutation. In
a recent Gilead HBV clinical studies, all the patients harbouring rtA194T or CYE/CYEI (S106C,
H126Y, D134E and L269I) at baseline achieved viral suppression by week 96 after TDF or TAF
treatment. No patients developed an rtA194T mutation or > 1 substitution of CYEI, and the
number of patients losing any substitutions of CYEI (n = 17) was similar to the number who
developed a single substitution of CYEI (n = 32) during treatment. Phenotypic evaluation of the
site‐directed mutant panel containing these mutations with or without other resistance mutations
did not demonstrate a significant shift in TFV and TAF potency in vitro. No evidence of rtA194T and
CYEI conferring resistance to TDF or TAF was observed based on the treatment responses to TDF
or TAF in patients with mutations at baseline, the lack of selection of mutations after starting TDF
or TAF treatment and no change in susceptibility to TFV or TAF in vitro. Overall, rtA194T and CYEI
did not appear to confer resistance in any patient on a TDF or TAF regimen.

This is an interesting systematic review. Whether HBV may develop primary resistance to tenofovir
(TFV or TDF) remains controversial. Some resistance mutations early reported have been denied
by other investigators, such as for rtA194T. Recently, a Korean group reported that a quadruple
mutation pattern could confer virus resistant to TFV. However, the results were also questioned
for this mutation pattern was also reported being detected in TFV-naive patients. In fact, TFV and
adevofir (ADV) had similar structure of nucleotide analogue with similar viral suppression
ability. TFV is superior to ADV just due to much lighter side-effect. As a result, the daily dose of TFV
is 30 fold higher over the dose of ADV (300 mg for TFV vs. 10 mg for ADV). Therefore, since ADV
resistance mutation (rtN236T, rtA181V) which confer at least 2-fold increase of EC50 could lead
to resistance, a primary TFV-resistance mutation or mutation pattern should at least confer 60-fold
increase of EC50. It is a pity that no convincing data are available to confirm that a mutation or a
mutation pattern could certainly confer such an increase of EC50 to TFV. From this view, currently
reported HBV mutations are lack of full evidence from phenotypic analysis to be a primary TFV￾resistance mutation. For my part, only a few reported mutation(s) such as the quadruple mutation

pattern could be termed as TFV-resistance-associated mutations. The mutations could apparently
increase EC50 (but less than 60 fold) and thus decrease the effect of TFV. With some other
influencing factor, the resistance is likely to occur. In general, this systemic review
comprehensively collected and analyzed relevant literatures. The analysis conclusion was
adequate with novelty. My only concern is whether it is appropriate to term all mutations listed in
Figure 1 as “mutations associated with TFV”, because supportive evidence for most of them to be a
TFV-associated mutation is weak or even lack. Probably they should be described as “mutations
potentially associated with TFV”.
