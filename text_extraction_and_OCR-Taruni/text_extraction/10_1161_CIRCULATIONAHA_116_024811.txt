ORIGINAL RESEARCH ARTICLE
BACKGROUND: Increased risks of cardiac morbidity and mortality among 
childhood cancer survivors have been described previously. However, 
little is known about the very long-term risks of cardiac mortality and 
whether the risk has decreased among those more recently diagnosed. We 
investigated the risk of long-term cardiac mortality among survivors within 
the recently extended British Childhood Cancer Survivor Study.
METHODS: The British Childhood Cancer Survivor Study is a population￾based cohort of 34489 five-year survivors of childhood cancer diagnosed 
from 1940 to 2006 and followed up until February 28, 2014, and is the 
largest cohort to date to assess late cardiac mortality. Standardized 
mortality ratios and absolute excess risks were used to quantify cardiac 
mortality excess risk. Multivariable Poisson regression models were used 
to evaluate the simultaneous effect of risk factors. Likelihood ratio tests 
were used to test for heterogeneity and trends.
RESULTS: Overall, 181 cardiac deaths were observed, which was 3.4 
times that expected. Survivors were 2.5 times and 5.9 times more at 
risk of ischemic heart disease and cardiomyopathy/heart failure death, 
respectively, than expected. Among those >60 years of age, subsequent 
primary neoplasms, cardiac disease, and other circulatory conditions 
accounted for 31%, 22%, and 15% of all excess deaths, respectively, 
providing clear focus for preventive interventions. The risk of both overall 
cardiac and cardiomyopathy/heart failure mortality was greatest among 
those diagnosed from 1980 to 1989. Specifically, for cardiomyopathy/
heart failure deaths, survivors diagnosed from 1980 to 1989 had 28.9 
times the excess number of deaths observed for survivors diagnosed 
either before 1970 or from 1990 on.
CONCLUSIONS: Excess cardiac mortality among 5-year survivors of 
childhood cancer remains increased beyond 50 years of age and has clear 
messages in terms of prevention strategies. However, the fact that the 
risk was greatest in those diagnosed from 1980 to 1989 suggests that 
initiatives to reduce cardiotoxicity among those treated more recently may 
be having a measurable impact.

T
reatment for childhood cancer has changed sub￾stantially over the past 50 years. In particular, 
since 1990, there have been attempts to reduce 
treatment intensity among children with relatively good￾prognosis neoplasms with the aim of reducing the risk 
of treatment-related morbidity and mortality. Previous re￾search has identified that thoracic radiotherapy and spe￾cific types of chemotherapy, particularly anthracyclines, 
which were introduced in the late 1970s, increase the 
risk of cardiac disease among survivors of childhood 
cancer.1,2 Thus, it is important to assess whether there 
is evidence of a measurable decline in the risk of death 
from cardiac disease among those treated since 1990.
However, to date, only 2 studies have investigated 
the risk of cardiac mortality in relation to treatment era, 
both of which were restricted by narrow treatment era 
time spans.3,4 For this reason, we have investigated the 
risk of cardiac mortality among nearly 35000 survivors 
of childhood cancer included in the BCCSS (British Child￾hood Cancer Survivor Study), the largest study to as￾sess mortality in survivors of childhood cancer.5 Princi￾pal advantages of the BCCSS compared with previous 
studies are that it is large-scale and population based 
and includes survivors treated across almost 7 decades 
(1940–2006), enabling an assessment of the risk of car￾diac mortality in relation to a wide span of treatment 
eras. Furthermore, because the BCCSS has an unrivaled 
number of survivors from earlier treatment decades, 
we have undertaken the most powerful investigation of 
excess cardiac mortality risks among childhood cancer 
survivors >50 years of age. As a result, the findings 
from this study provide new evidence with which to in￾form survivors of childhood cancer and clinicians and to 
update clinical follow-up guidelines.
METHODS
The BCCSS
The BCCSS comprises 34 489 five-year survivors of child￾hood cancer diagnosed under 15 years age from 1940 to 
2006 in Britain. The cohort was the first national population￾based study of survivors of childhood cancer to be untaken in 
Great Britain and was identified from the National Registry of 
Childhood Tumors, which has an ≈99% ascertainment rate.6
The study is maintained at the Center for Childhood Cancer 
Survivor Studies, where research on a wide spectrum of pos￾sible adverse health outcomes of childhood cancer and its 
treatment is undertaken. Additional details relating to the study 
may be found online7 and in the descriptive article concerned 
with methodological aspects underlying the BCCSS.8 Ethics 
approval for the study was obtained from the National Research 
Ethics Service, and legal approval to process identifiable data 
without consent was approved by the Confidentiality Advisory 
Group. Descriptive characteristics of the BCCSS cohort can be 
found in Tables I–III in the online-only Data Supplement.
Death Ascertainment
Collaboration with the Health and Social Care Information 
Center (England and Wales) and National Health Service Central 
Register (Scotland) enabled us to ascertain each survivor’s vital 
and residency/emigration status. For each death, an attempt 
was made to obtain the death certificate and underlying cause 
of death as coded by the Office of National Statistics (England 
and Wales) and National Records of Scotland (Scotland) 
using the relevant International Classification of Diseases. 
International Classification of Diseases codes corresponding 
to a cardiac death were identified and subcategorized into clini￾cally relevant groups for analysis, specifically ischemic heart 
disease (IHD), cardiomyopathy/heart failure (CM/HF), arrhyth￾mias, pericardial disease, and valvular disease (Table IV in the 
online-only Data Supplement). Follow-up for cardiac mortality 
began at 5-year survival and continued until the first instance 
of emigration, death, or February 28, 2014.
Statistical Analyses
Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and absolute excess 
risks (AERs) were calculated with standard cohort techniques.9
The SMR was defined as the observed divided by the expected 
number of deaths. The AER was defined as the observed minus 
the expected number of deaths divided by person-years at risk 
multiplied by 10000. Expected numbers were calculated by 
multiplying the person-years within each sex-, age- (quinquen￾nial), and calendar year- (single year) specific stratum by the 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• We report for the first time risks of cardiac mortality 
among 5-year survivors of childhood cancer beyond 
50 years of age.
• In particular, among those >60 years of age, sub￾sequent primary neoplasms, cardiac disease, and 
other circulatory conditions accounted for 31%, 
22%, and 15% of all excess deaths, respectively, 
providing clear focus for preventive interventions.
• The present study is also the first to show that the 
number of excess cardiac deaths, in particular car￾diomyopathy/heart failure deaths, was greatest 
among those diagnosed in the 1980s.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Our findings suggest that cardiac disease becomes 
increasingly important as childhood cancer survivors 
reach mature adulthood, suggesting that initiatives 
aimed at preventing excess mortality and morbidity 
in survivors >50 years of age should be focused 
on both subsequent primary neoplasm and cardiac 
disease prevention, surveillance, and management.
• Nonetheless, efforts to reduce cardiotoxicity among 
those treated more recently appear to be having a 
measurable impact because the number of excess 
cardiac deaths was greatest among survivors diag￾nosed in the 1980s.

corresponding mortality rate for the population of England and 
Wales and then summing across the strata.10
Multivariable Poisson regression models for the SMRs and 
AERs were then fitted to evaluate the simultaneous effect of 
the following demographic- and cancer-related factors: sex, 
first primary neoplasm (FPN) type, age at cancer diagnosis, 
treatment era of diagnosis, and attained age. The results from 
the adjusted multivariable model were reported in terms of rela￾tive risks (which may be interpreted as the ratios of the SMRs 
adjusted for other factors fitted) and excess mortality ratios 
(EMRs; which may be interpreted as the ratios of the AERs 
adjusted for other factors fitted9
; Table V in the online-only Data 
Supplement). To test for heterogeneity or linear trend, likelihood 
ratio tests within Poisson regression models were used. P for 
heterogeneity tests the null hypothesis that the relative risks or 
EMRs are equal across levels of the factor concerned, against 
the alternative hypothesis that the relative risks or EMRs vary 
across levels of the factor, having adjusted for other factors 
included within the model. P for trend tests the null hypothesis 
that the relative risks or EMRs are equal across levels of the fac￾tor concerned, against the alternative hypothesis that the rela￾tive risks or EMRs increase or decrease linearly across levels 
of the factor, having adjusted for other factors included within 
the model. Because we anticipated a priori that there might be 
evidence of risks increasing and then declining as treatment era 
became more recent, particularly in relation to anthracycline￾related CM/HF, we also investigated for evidence of a quadratic 
relationship in risks with treatment era using likelihood ratio 
tests within multivariable Poisson regression models. P for qua￾dratic tests whether there is evidence of such a specific type 
of systematic nonlinear variation in the relative risks or EMRs 
across levels of the factor concerned, having adjusted for other 
factors included within the model.
Cumulative mortality, as a function of follow-up, was esti￾mated by use of the stcompet command in Stata.11 Causes 
of death other than the one under study were treated as com￾peting risks.12,13 To test for heterogeneity among cumulative 
mortality curves, log-rank tests were used.
All analyses were completed with Stata 13.1,11 for which 
the criterion for statistical significance was a 2-sided value of 
P<0.05.
Patient Involvement
Overall, survivors showed their support for the study by return￾ing 10488 BCCSS questionnaires, which represented 80% of 
those sent to survivors. Furthermore, almost all survivors com￾pleting the BCCSS questionnaire requested receipt of study 
newsletters, the means by which we inform survivors of the 
findings of the research. Last, 2 patient representatives attend 
the BCCSS Steering Group meetings and provide feedback on 
research priorities and research translation.
RESULTS
Study Characteristics
From 5-year survival, the cohort was followed up for a 
total of 620753 person-years, with a mean follow-up of 
18.0 years (range, 0.0–68.7 years) and to a mean at￾tained age of 29.6 years (range, 5.5–85.6 years). By 
the study exit date, 4475 individuals (13.0%) in the co￾hort had died; of those deaths, 181 (4.0%) were attrib￾uted to cardiac causes (Table 1). The mean follow-up 
time from diagnosis and attained age at cardiac death 
were 31.4 and 39.2 years, respectively, which were 
greater than that observed for individuals who died of 
a noncardiac cause. Men accounted for approximately 
two thirds (63.5%) of the cardiac deaths, and survivors 
of central nervous system tumors (excluding primitive 
neuroectodermal tumor), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), and 
Wilms accounted for nearly 50% of the cardiac deaths 
observed when combined.
Overall Cardiac Mortality
Survivors of childhood cancer experienced 3.4 times 
(95% confidence interval [CI], 2.9–3.9) the number of 
cardiac deaths expected from the general population, 
which equated to 2.1 (95% CI, 1.6–2.5) excess cardiac 
deaths per 10000 person-years (Table 2). All FPN types 
with at least 5 observed cardiac deaths were at a statis￾tically significant increased risk of cardiac death (Table 3). 
The SMR was substantially raised (SMR>5.0) for survi￾vors of acute myeloid leukemia, Wilms, and HL at 23.5 
(95% CI, 11.2–43.1), 6.5 (95% CI, 4.0–10.0), and 5.4 
(95% CI, 3.7–7.6), respectively. From 5 to 19 to >60 
years of age, the SMR declined from 9.7-fold (95% CI, 
5.9–15.0) to 2.2-fold (95% CI, 1.3–3.5) that expected, 
respectively, whereas for the same age groupings the 
AER rose from 0.7 (95% CI, 0.4–1.1) to 23.7 (95% CI, 
3.6–43.8) excess cardiac deaths per 10000 person￾years; both of these trends were statistically significant 
(SMR P for trend=0.0065; AER P for trend<0.0001). 
When assessed by treatment era, evidence of a qua￾dratic relationship was identified for the SMRs (P for 
quadratic=0.0014) and AERs (P for quadratic=0.0072), 
where after adjustment the risk was higher among those 
treated in the 1980s than those treated in decades be￾fore or since (Table 4). Compared with those diagnosed 
before 1970, the relative risk for cardiac death was 1.6 
times (95% CI, 1.1–2.5), 2.3 times (95% CI, 1.4–3.8), 
and 1.0 times (95% CI, 0.4–2.1) higher among those di￾agnosed in 1970 to 1979, 1980 to 1989, and 1990 to 
2006, respectively, after adjustment for sex, FPN type, 
age at diagnosis, and attained age.
In Table 5, we provide the percentage contributions 
of specific causes of death to the total excess number 
of deaths observed at different attained ages. Among 
those >60 years of age, cardiac deaths accounted for 
22% and 41% of all excess deaths and all excess non￾neoplastic deaths, respectively. Of all excess deaths ob￾served among those >60 years of age, 31%, 22%, and 
15% were attributable to subsequent primary neoplasms 
(SPNs), cardiac disease, and other circulatory diseases, 
respectively, accounting for 68% of the excess number 
of deaths overall.

Overall, the cumulative mortality for cardiac death 
was 5.0% at 60 years of follow-up compared with 3.5% 
expected (Figure I in the online-only Data Supplement). 
Among the FPN types, the cumulative mortality was 
greatest for survivors of Wilms and HL (Figure 1); the cu￾mulative mortality for HL survivors began to increase at 
20 years of follow-up compared with 25 years of follow￾up in Wilms survivors and increased at a higher rate than 
that observed for Wilms survivors.
Cardiac-Specific Mortality
Of the 181 cardiac deaths observed, there were 96 IHD, 
52 CM/HF, 8 valvular disease, 5 arrhythmia, 2 pericar￾dial disease, and 18 other cardiac deaths (7 pulmonary 
heart disease, 4 acute/subacute infective endocarditis, 4 
cardiovascular disease unspecified, 1 hypertensive heart 
and renal disease, 1 hypertensive heart disease without 
heart failure, 1 other ill-defined heart disease; Table 2). 
The SMRs for IHD, CM/HF, valvular, arrhythmia, pericardi￾al, and other cardiac deaths were as follows: 2.5 (95% CI, 
2.0–3.1), 5.9 (95% CI, 4.4–7.7), 3.6 (95% CI, 1.6–7.2), 
3.4 (95% CI, 1.1–8.0), 8.0 (95% CI, 1.0–29.0), and 8.3 
(95% CI, 4.9–13.1), respectively. Because IHD and CM/
HF accounted for >80% of cardiac deaths overall, we con￾sider only these 2 specific cardiac outcomes separately.
IHD Mortality
The cumulative mortality of IHD deaths increased steadi￾ly until ≈45 years of follow-up, at which point there was a 
steeper increase, ultimately reaching 3.8% at 65 years 
of follow-up, which was 1.0% higher than expected (Fig￾ure I in the online-only Data Supplement). The SMR for 
IHD death was highest for survivors of Wilms (SMR, 5.3; 
95% CI, 2.7–9.5) and HL (SMR, 4.4; 95% CI, 2.7–6.8; 
Table 3). Survivors of central nervous system tumors 
(excluding primitive neuroectodermal tumor), non￾Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and ‘other’ FPN types also 
had a statistically significant elevated risk of IHD death. 
As attained age increased, the SMR declined significant￾ly (P for trend=0.0344) and AER increased significantly 
(P for trend<0.0001); beyond 60 years of age, survivors 
remained >2 times (SMR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.3–3.8) more 
at risk than expected, which equated to 22.2 (95% CI, 
3.2–41.1) excess IHD deaths per 10000 person-years. 
There was no evidence of a relationship between treat￾ment era and the excess risk (multiplicative or additive) 
of IHD deaths (Table 4).
CM/HF Mortality
At 65 years from diagnosis, the cumulative mortality 
of CM/HF deaths was 0.5% compared with 0.3% ex￾pected (Figure I in the online-only Data Supplement). 
All FPN types with at least 5 observed CM/HF deaths 
were found to be at a substantially higher risk than 
expected of CM/HF death (SMR>5.0; Table 3); survi￾vors of acute myeloid leukemia, NHL, and Wilms were 
greatest at risk, with 66.0 times (95% CI, 28.5–130.0), 
10.2 times (95% CI, 3.7–22.2), and 8.0 times (95% CI, 
2.6–18.8) the number of expected CM/HF deaths, re￾spectively. After adjustment, there was no evidence of

a linear increase or decrease in excess risk of CM/HF 
death with attained age (SMR P for trend=0.8121, AER 
P for trend=0.0591). However, with regard to treatment 
era, evidence of a quadratic relationship was found for 
both the SMRs (P for quadratic<0.0001) and AERs (P for 
quadratic<0.0001; Table 4). More specifically, the num￾ber of excess CM/HF deaths increased with treatment 
era beginning around 1970, peaked among those treat￾ed in the 1980s, and then subsequently declined among 
those treated more recently (Figure 2). After adjustment 
for sex, FPN type, age at diagnosis, and attained age, 
survivors diagnosed from 1970 to 1979, 1980 to 1989, 
and 1990 to 2006 had 13.9 times (95% CI, 1.1–168.5), 
28.9 times (95% CI, 2.4–354.6), and 4.5 times (95% 
CI, 0.3–69.4) more excess CM/HF deaths, respectively, 
than survivors diagnosed before 1970 (Table 4).

DISCUSSION
This largest ever study of cardiac mortality after child￾hood cancer within a cohort of 34489 five-year survi￾vors provides an unprecedented opportunity to investi￾gate the impact of treatment era on the risk of cardiac 
death. Furthermore, with 73565 person-years and 86 
cardiac deaths among those >40 years of age and 
21696 person-years and 50 cardiac deaths among 
those >50 years of age, this is the first study to

satisfactorily assess the pattern of excess cardiac 
deaths among survivors >50 years old. In doing so, 
this study adds 250728 person-years and 76 cardiac 
deaths to our previous largest study assessing cardiac 
mortality.14 Furthermore, this study expands on and ad￾dresses many of the limitations of previous work assess￾ing mortality among childhood cancer survivors from the 
United States3,4,15 and Nordic countries.16,17
Principal Findings and Comparisons With Other 
Studies
Although 2 previous studies have assessed trends in 
the risk of cardiac causes of death among 5-year survi￾vors of childhood cancer in relation to treatment era,3,4
this is the first study to provide evidence of a qua￾dratic relationship for the excess risk of cardiac death 
overall and for CM/HF death in relation to treatment 
era, for which the number of excess deaths increases 
with treatment era, peaks among those treated in the 
1980s, and then subsequently declines among those 
treated more recently. This relationship corresponds 
closely to the introduction of anthracycline chemo￾therapy, which has been shown to increase the risk 
of dilated cardiomyopathy18–20 and congestive heart 
failure.21 However, these results differ from a CCSS
report3 that found a significant decline in the adjusted 
relative rate of death resulting from cardiac causes 
with more recent treatment era. Although the CCSS 
has a more restricted diagnosis period (1970–1999, 
30 years) compared with our study (1940–2006, 66 
years), it is unlikely that this explains the difference 
observed because we did not observe a linear decline 
in excess cardiac deaths with treatment era after re￾stricting our diagnosis period to match the CCSS (SMR 
P for trend=0.7687, AER P for trend=0.3521; Table VI 
in the online-only Data Supplement). In fact, a quadratic 
relationship between treatment era and excess cardiac 
deaths was observed in the BCCSS when the diagno￾sis period was restricted to 1970 to 1999 (SMR P

Cardiac Mortality Among Childhood Cancer Survivors
ORIGINAL RESEARCH

for quadratic=0.0024, AER P for quadratic=0.0019). 
A possible explanation for the difference observed be￾tween the BCCSS and CCSS would be differences in 
childhood cancer treatment exposures related to the 
development of cardiac diseases between the 2 stud￾ies. However, it is not possible to explore this hypoth￾esis because of the lack of detailed treatment informa￾tion for the BCCSS.
Overall, cardiac mortality estimates in this cohort 
were elevated at 3 times that expected. The risk of 
cardiac death remained elevated beyond 60 years of 
age, and the number of excess cardiac deaths was 
observed to increase significantly with age. Among 
those >60 years of age, cardiac deaths accounted 
for 22% and 41% of all excess deaths and all non￾neoplastic excess deaths, respectively. This finding 
provides evidence that as survivors age beyond 60 
years, circulatory deaths account for more excess 
deaths, 37% (60% of which was due to cardiac 
causes), than SPNs, 31%. With 31%, 22%, and 15% 
(in total 68%) of all excess deaths among those >60 
years of age attributable to SPNs, cardiac disease, 
and other circulatory conditions, respectively, there 
is a clear message in terms of prevention of prema￾ture morbidity and mortality: Specific interventions, 
in terms of surveillance and treatment, that reduce 
SPNs and circulatory disease in survivors of child￾hood cancer are needed.
Another finding worth noting from our study relates 
to the risk of cardiac death by FPN type. Although HL 
survivors have long been recognized as having an in￾creased risk of cardiac death, leading much research 
to focus on these survivors,22–24 Wilms survivors were 
in fact found to have a greater risk of cardiac death 
than HL survivors. In particular, Wilms survivors were 
found to have the greatest risk of IHD death among 
all FPN types; this finding suggests that hyperten￾sion and having 1 kidney are strong risk factors in 
Wilms survivors for cardiac death because the car￾diac radiotherapy exposure in these survivors would 
be expected to be much lower than that used for HL 
survivors.

Special Consideration
Despite the increased risk of cardiac death reported in 
this study during the 1980s, it is important to recognize 
that many more children diagnosed with cancer in the 
1980s have survived as a result of anthracycline che￾motherapy than have died as a result of its late effects. 
Furthermore, the fact that the excess risk of cardiac 
death has subsequently declined in those diagnosed in 
the 1990s and 2000s suggests that measures to re￾duce cardiotoxicity through the use of alternative drugs, 
lower cumulative doses, and improved monitoring and 
intervention appears to be having a beneficial effect for 
those treated more recently.
Strengths and Weaknesses
The main strengths of our study are its large size, popula￾tion-based design, wide diagnosis period, and long avail￾able follow-up time, which have provided an exceptional 
opportunity to assess cardiac mortality after childhood 
cancer. Through these strengths, we have been able to 
assess the impact of cancer treatment on cardiac mortal￾ity from prechemotherapy treatment eras to modern ther￾apies and protocols. We have also been able to provide 
for the first time results on the risk of cardiac mortality 
among survivors of childhood cancer beyond 60 years of 
age. Because selection bias will be minimized through our 
population-based study design, these results are gener￾alizable to survivors of childhood cancer in Great Britain, 
as well as other childhood cancer populations provided 
that they were treated with similar therapies. Therefore, 
the findings of this study provide useful evidence for sur￾vivors, clinicians, and clinical follow-up guidelines in Great 
Britain and potentially internationally.
A weakness of our study is the lack of detailed radio￾therapy and chemotherapy information, which precluded 
any examination of dose-response patterns of treatment 
exposures in relation to cardiac mortality risk. However, 
the large-scale population-based design, wide spectrum 
of treatment eras, and very long follow-up available in 
this study provide opportunities not available in other 
cohorts. Another possible limitation of this study is that 
our classification of cardiac death relied on the under￾lying cause of death as listed on the death certificate, 
which has been previously shown to have imperfect 
accuracy.25–28 Although there is possible misclassifica￾Figure 1. Cumulative mortality for cardiac death by first primary neoplasm (FPN) diagnostic groups, by follow￾up (years since diagnosis), compared with that expected.

Cardiac Mortality Among Childhood Cancer Survivors
ORIGINAL RESEARCH

tion, it is more likely that we have underascertained 
cardiac deaths and thus underestimated the risk of car￾diac death among childhood cancer survivors because 
these individuals are more likely to be coded as having 
a neoplastic-related death resulting from their previous 
medical history.16
Reassessment of Findings
Over the treatment eras covered by this study, survival 
has improved substantially, and treatment regimens have 
changed markedly. Because of these evolving changes 
in survival and treatment exposures, reassessment of 
cardiac mortality after childhood cancer is crucial. For 
example, although we observed that the risk of cardiac 
death was greatest among those treated in the 1980s, 
it is important to determine whether with additional fol￾low-up the more recently diagnosed survivors remain at 
a decreased risk or whether cardiac death has merely 
been delayed as a result of increased awareness, sur￾veillance, and treatment of late effects after known car￾diotoxic exposures. Similarly, we observed that cardiac 
death became one of the principal contributors to the 
excess number of deaths beyond 60 years of age. How￾ever, the survivors at least 60 years old at the time of 
our study are quite different from those more recently di￾agnosed in terms of both FPN types and treatment expo￾sures. Therefore, a reassessment of the mortality risks 
in survivors >60 years of age is necessary in the future 
to determine the generalizability of our results for future 
childhood cancer survivors who reach 60 years of age.
Future Research
At present, the Center for Childhood Cancer Survivor 
Studies is involved in several investigations aimed at im￾proving knowledge of the risks and causes of cardiovas￾cular complications among childhood cancer survivors. In 
particular, the center is collaborating in PanCareSurFup29
and PROCARDIO,30 both European consortiums investi￾gating the link between cardiovascular disease and expo￾sure of the heart and major vessels to radiotherapy and 
chemotherapy. For these projects, detailed treatment re￾cords were collected, and cumulative doses of radiation 
from radiotherapy and of each anticancer drug are being 
calculated. The resultant case-control studies will enable 
investigation of the dose-response between radiation and 
chemotherapy exposure of the heart and the risk of heart 
disease. The BCCSS cohort has also been linked to the 
national database of Hospital Episode Statistics, which is 
an electronic health record system for all hospitalizations 
in England. Through this linkage, the BCCSS will be in a 
stronger position to understand cardiac morbidity, and its 
treatment, in childhood cancer survivors. As a result of 
such initiatives, the BCCSS will be able to provide further 
insight into cardiovascular late effects among childhood 
cancer survivors in the United Kingdom.
Conclusions and Implications
The greatest excess risks for deaths from CM/HF were 
observed among those treated between 1980 and 
1989, which suggests that initiatives to reduce cardio￾toxicity among those treated more recently may be hav￾ing a measurable impact. Among those >60 years of 
age, SPNs, cardiac disease, and other circulatory condi￾tions accounted for 31%, 22%, and 15% of all excess 
deaths, respectively, providing clear focus for preventive 
interventions. These findings provide important informa￾tion for survivors, clinicians, and clinical guidelines, par￾ticularly in relation to preventing excess morbidity and 
mortality in survivors >60 years of age.
