SUMMARY: Transarterial embolization in the external carotid artery (ECA) territory has a major role in
the endovascular management of epistaxis, skull base tumors, and dural arteriovenous fistulas.
Knowledge of the potential anastomotic routes, identification of the cranial nerve supply from the ECA,
and the proper choice of embolic material are crucial to help the interventionalist avoid neurologic
complications during the procedure. Three regions along the skull base constitute potential anasto￾motic routes between the extracranial and intracranial arteries: the orbital, the petrocavernous, and the
upper cervical regions. Branches of the internal maxillary artery have anastomoses with the ophthalmic
artery and petrocavernous internal carotid artery (ICA), whereas the branches of the ascending
pharyngeal artery are connected to the petrocavernous ICA. Branches of both the ascending pharyn￾geal artery and the occipital artery have anastomoses with the vertebral artery. To avoid cranial nerve
palsy, one must have knowledge of the supply to the lower cranial nerves: The petrous branch of the
middle meningeal artery and the stylomastoid branch of the posterior auricular artery form the facial
arcade as the major supply to the facial nerve, and the neuromeningeal trunk of the ascending
pharyngeal artery supplies the lower cranial nerves (CN IXXII).
I
n the last 20 years, the role of embolization of the external
carotid artery (ECA) territory has become increasingly more
important, mainly for transarterial endovascular treatment of
dural arteriovenous fistulas,1,2 treatment of epistaxis, and preop￾erative embolization of head and neck tumors to decrease surgical
blood loss.3-6 However, because embryologic and phylogenetic
development closely links the ECAs to the intracranial arteries,
there are certain common anastomotic routes that have to bekept
in mind while doing the embolization procedures to avoid possi￾ble major complications such as embolic stroke or cranial nerve
palsies.7 Most of these anastomotic channels follow the cranial
nerves along the neural foramen. Although they may not be visu￾alized on routine (ie, global) catheter angiographies, they are al￾ways present and will therefore necessarily open under the fol￾lowing circumstances: 1) with increased intra-arterial pressure
(eg, during embolization procedures or superselective injec￾tions8
), 2)in the presence of high-flow shunts as a consequence of
the “sump effect,” or 3) as collateral routeswhen occlusions of the
major intracranial arteries occur.9-12
The functional vascular anatomy concept, as introduced by
Lasjaunias et al7 and Berenstein et al in 1983,13 analyzes the
arterial anatomy of the head and neck by their territories,
which include the internal maxillary, linguofacial, pharyngo￾occipital, thyroidal, cervical, internal carotid, and vertebral
territories. The adjacent territories have inter-relationships
and will function as potential vascular collaterals in case of
vascular occlusion. There are 3 regions within these territories
(Fig 1) that serve as the major extracranial–intracranial anas￾tomotic pathways:
1) The orbital region via the ophthalmic artery that is the
interface between the internal maxillary and internal carotid
territories.
2) The petrous-cavernous region via the inferolateral trunk
(ILT), the petrous branches of the internal carotid artery (ICA),
and the meningohypophyseal trunk to the carotid artery.
3) The upper cervical region via the ascending pharyngeal,
the occipital, and the ascending and deep cervical arteries to
the vertebral artery.
The major extracranial and intracranial anastomoses are
summarized in Table 1.
Orbital Region (anastomoses to the ophthalmic artery)
The most important risk when embolizing within this region is
occlusion of the central retinal artery, which results in blind￾ness of the patient. Infrequently, embolic stroke can also occur
through retrograde filling of the ICA. Because the central ret￾inal artery typically originates with or close to the posterior

ciliary arteries (either the medial or lateral branches) from the
ophthalmic artery,7 the choroidal blush, best seen on the lat￾eral angiographic view in the capillary and early venous
phases, is often used as a landmark to identify its origin. The
anastomoses between the ECA and ophthalmic artery are
summarized in Table 2.
Proximal Internal Maxillary Collaterals
There are several potential orbital collateral routes from the
ECA to the ophthalmic artery. The most frequently encoun￾tered is the meningo-ophthalmic artery (Fig 2).14This artery is
the extreme variation in which the remnant of the embryo￾logic stapedial artery (ie, the middle meningeal artery [MMA]
and the distal internal maxillary artery [IMA]) takes over the
entire orbital supply from the primitive ophthalmic artery.7
This results in supply to the distal ophthalmic artery, includ￾ing the central retinal artery and ciliary arteries only from the
MMA as the remnant of the stapedial system. The important
clues that suggest this variation are nonvisualization of the
ophthalmic artery from the ICA and a choroidal blush on the
Fig 2. Left ECA (A) and left ICA (B) angiograms (lateral view) demonstrate a meningo-ophthalmic artery arising from the left MMA, just before it crosses the sphenoid ridge on the lateral
view (black arrow), contributing supply to the entire orbit with the absence of the ophthalmic artery from the ICA (white arrow). Note the choroidal blush (arrowhead). C, Right ECA angiogram
of the same patient shows anastomosis between the MMA and the ophthalmic artery through the lacrimal system with retrograde filling of the ICA (thin black arrows).

ECA injection (Fig 2A, -B). In this setting, even proximal oc￾clusion of the MMA carries a high risk because the MMA is the
sole supply to the distal ophthalmic artery and must be
avoided.
The stapedial artery originally arises from the ICA and is
later annexed by the ECA and, therefore, will constitute a po￾tential anastomotic route to the orbit. These other MMA
collaterals to the ophthalmic artery are through the super￾ficial recurrent meningeal branch of the lacrimal artery,
which anastomose with the orbital branches through the
superior orbital fissure15 and the anterior falcine artery, a
meningeal branch arising from the distal ophthalmic artery
supplying the anterior falx, anastomosing indirectly with
the anterior branch of the MMA through the meninges.7
The orbital branches can be best seen on the lateral projec￾tion, typically just inferior to the sphenoid ridge (Fig 2C),
similar to the location of the meningo-ophthalmic artery
origin. These above-mentioned anastomoses are always
present (except for cases with a meningo-ophthalmic ar￾tery). However, they are usually not visualized on global
injections and only open with increased pressure during em￾bolization procedures of the MMA.
Distal IMA Collaterals
The distal IMA has anastomoses with the inferior branch of
the lacrimal artery of the ophthalmic artery through the ante￾rior deep temporal artery (Fig 3) and through the infraorbital
artery.7,14,15 The sphenopalatine artery, also from the distal
IMA, is connected with the anterior and posterior ethmoidal
arteries of the ophthalmic artery through the septal arteries,
which are classically seen in large juvenile angiofibromas.16
The sphenopalatine artery is one of the targets in the emboli￾zation of epistaxis; therefore, these anastomoses have to be
kept in mind. Because their diameter is 80m, embolization
of the branches with particles greater than this size is consid￾ered safe.
Cutaneous Collaterals
The frontal branch of the superficial temporal artery (STA)
connects with the ophthalmic artery through the supraorbital
artery. The distal end of the facial artery (FA) anastomoses
with the dorsal nasal artery at the angular termination.7,17
Both the FA and the STA branches thereby classically connect
to the distal (third) portion of the ophthalmic artery.
Cavernous-Petrous Region (anastomoses to the ICA)
Within this region, there are 3 major anastomotic areas to the
ICA: the petrous, the clivus, and the cavernous territories. The
corresponding branches of the ICA are the mandibular artery
(remnant of the dorsal part of the first aortic arch) and the
caroticotympanic artery (remnant of the embryologic hyoid
artery) for the petrous territory, the meningohypophyseal
trunk (remnant of the embryologic primitive maxillary artery)
and the lateral clival artery for the clival territory, and the ILT
(remnant of the embryologic dorsal ophthalmic artery) for the
cavernous region.7,18,19 The major anastomotic routes to the
ILT are summarized in Table 3.
Ascending Pharyngeal Collaterals
The ascending pharyngeal artery is the remnant of the embry￾ologic artery of the third brachial arch and divides into 2 major
trunks: the pharyngeal and neuromeningeal trunks, which
connect to the petrous and cavernous ICA through several
channels.20,21 The anteriorly located pharyngeal trunk gives
off 3 branches: the inferior, middle, and superior pharyngeal
arteries. The latter has the most important anastomotic routes,
including the eustachian tube anastomotic circle that connects

deep temporal artery from the distal IMA through the lacri￾mal artery to the ophthalmic artery (black arrow). Note the
retrograde filling of the proximal ophthalmic artery; the same
curve is also seen from the ICA injection (white arrows).

with the mandibular artery from the petrous ICA and an
anastomosis with the accessory meningeal artery (AMA)
and pterygovaginal artery from the distal IMA (Fig 4). Fi￾nally, this artery has a carotid canal branch that enters the
cranium through the foramen lacerum to the cavernous
sinus to join with the recurrent artery of the foramen
lacerum, (branch of the lateral clival artery, which arises
from the C5 portion of the carotid siphon) and the ILT
(which connects to the cavernous ICA). The distal neuro￾meningeal trunk branches into 2 major arteries, the jugular
and hypoglossal branches, and enters the cranial cavity
through the corresponding foramen.7,20,21 Both branches
give off medial and lateral clival branches immediately after
exiting the hypoglossal and jugular foramen, respectively.
Fig 4. Left ICA angiogram in anteroposterior (A) and lateral
(B) views demonstrates the anastomosis between the man￾dibular artery arising from the petrous ICA and the superior
pharyngeal branch of the ascending pharyngeal artery (black
arrows) in a patient with a right hypoglossal canal (anterior
condyloid) dural arteriovenous fistula. Left vertebral artery
angiogram in anteroposterior (C) and lateral (D) views shows
arterial feeders from the vertebral arteries through the odon￾toid arch, arising from the C3 level (white arrows), anasto￾mosing with the hypoglossal branch of the ascending pha￾ryngeal artery (arrowhead).

anteroposterior (A) and lateral (B) views reveals the anasto￾mosis between the neuromeningeal trunk (black arrows) of
the ascending pharyngeal artery and the lateral clival artery

These anastomose with the clival branches from the lateral
clival artery (Fig 5) and the meningohypophyseal trunk,
which can often be seen as participating arteries in the sup￾ply to meningiomas that develop in this region (Fig 6). The
inferior tympanic artery, which may arise from the main
trunk of the ascending pharyngeal artery or one of its major
branches, enters the tympanic cavity through the inferior
tympanic foramen with Jacobson’s nerve and retains the
embryologic connection of the artery of the third brachial
arch (ascending pharyngeal artery) and the hyoid artery (or
caroticotympanic artery) from the petrous ICA. Within the
middle ear, the inferior tympanic artery also anastomoses
with the superior tympanic artery, which arises from the
petrous branch of the MMA, the anterior tympanic artery
from the proximal IMA, the stylomastoid artery from the
posterior auricular-occipital artery, and the mandibular
branch of the ICA.7,19
Typically these anastomoses are not visualized on the cere￾bral angiograms but may open up during embolization. In
some rare cases, agenesis of the cervical ICA and persistence of
the embryologic hyostapedial artery will result in the so-called
“aberrant ICA,” in which the ICA enters the skull base through
Fig 6. Right ICA (A) and right ascending pharyngeal (B)
angiograms in a lateral view reveal the typical “sunburst”
appearance of a clival meningoma supplied by the meningo￾hypophyseal trunk from the ICA (black arrow) and clival
branches from the neuromeningeal trunk of the ascending
pharyngeal artery (white arrow). Retrograde filling of the
pterygovaginal artery of the distal IMA from the superior
pharyngeal artery through the eustachian tube anastomotic
circle is also seen (arrowheads).

injections.

the inferior tympanic canal, and the cervical part of the ICA is
actually the ascending pharyngeal artery.7,22,23
Proximal IMA Collaterals
The major anastomotic route for the MMA and AMA is
through the ILT to the cavernous ICA.18,19,24 After exiting the
foramen spinosum, the MMA gives off cavernous branches
that anastomose with the superior or tentorial branch of the
ILT. The orbital branches of the MMA, besides their connec￾tion to the ophthalmic artery, also anastomose with the an￾teromedial branch of the ILT within the superior orbital fis￾sure. The superior division of the AMA enters the cavernous
sinus through the foramen ovale to anastomose with the pos￾teromedial branch of the ILT (Figs 7 and 8), which courses
under the trigeminal ganglion and accompanies CN V2.25 In
20% of cases, the AMA may take over the entire supply of the
ILT territory.7 These cavernous collaterals are often enlarged
and serve as the arterial feeders in cavernous dural arterio￾venous fistulas (Fig 7).
The petrosquamous or the posterior branch of the MMA
also anastomoses with the marginal artery of the tentorium,
which can arise from either the ILT, the ophthalmic artery,
or the meningohypophyseal trunk of the ICA.7 Apart from
the cavernous anastomosis, the AMA also has smaller anas￾tomotic channels surrounding the eustachian tube, as men￾tioned previously, with the superior pharyngeal branch of
the ascending pharyngeal artery, the mandibular branch of
the petrous ICA, and the pterygovaginal artery from the
distal IMA.
Distal IMA Collaterals
There are several branches of the distal IMA that have intra￾cranial anastomoses with the ICA. The first is the artery of the
foramen rotundum, which, as implied by its name, runs
through the foramen rotundum and is best seen in the lateral
view, where it can be identified with its corkscrew appear￾ance, connecting with the anterolateral branch of the ILT (Fig
8)18,19 or, in rare cases, with the lateral clival artery (Fig 7C).
The vidian artery has a distinctly horizontal course, which can
be easily identified on the lateral view from the distal IMA
through the vidian canal to the foramen lacerum, where it
anastomoses with the corresponding vidian branch of the
mandibular artery arising from the petrous ICA (Figs 8 and
9).12,26-29 The pterygovaginal artery, which often originates
adjacent to the vidian artery, has a more inferior course
through the pterygovaginal canal along the roof of the naso￾pharynx, ending at the anastomotic circle around the eusta￾chian tube.7
Upper Cervical Regions (anastomoses to the
vertebral artery)
Occipital Collaterals
The occipital artery is a remnant of the embryologic type I
and type II proatlantal arteries, which correspond to the C1
Fig 8. Left ECA (A) and left ICA (B) angiograms in the lateral
view of a patient with cerebrofacial arteriovenous metameric
syndrome (type II) and an arteriovenous malformation of the
optic nerve reveal an anastomosis between the AMA through
the foramen ovale (black arrows) and the artery of the
foramen rotundum (white arrows) to the ILT and the vidian
artery (arrowheads), arising from the distal IMA to the vidian
branch of the mandibular artery.
Fig 9. Right ICA (A) and right ECA (B) angiograms in lateral
view, posttransvenous coiling of a cavernous dural arterio￾venous malformation, demonstrate the anastomosis between
the vidian artery from the distal IMA to the vidian branch of
the mandibular artery. The vidian artery has a characteristic
horizontal course on the lateral view (black arrows), thus
differentiating it from the more inferior course of the ptery￾govaginal artery (white arrows), which also anastomoses
with a branch of the mandibular artery (black arrowhead) and
the superior pharyngeal artery (white arrowhead) around the
eustachian tube.

and C2 segmental arteries.7,30 In the fetal period, both em￾bryologic arteries serve as connection routes between the
carotid and vertebrobasilar systems. Full persistence of
these segmental arteries is extremely rare31,32; however, the
occipital artery, as their remnant, still retains its connection
from the external carotid system to the vertebral artery
through the posterior anastomotic radicular branches,
which arise from the horizontal portion of the occipital
arteries at both the C1 and C2 levels (Figs 10 and 11). These
are the major collaterals from the vertebral artery to the
carotid system, which are often seen in case of common
carotid artery ligation or occlusion.10,33-35 The stylomas￾toid artery, which may arise from either the posterior au￾ricular or the occipital artery, supplies the meninges of the
posterior fossa and forms anastomoses with other menin￾geal branches from the MMA, the ascending pharyngeal
artery, the ILT, the meningohypophyseal trunk, and the
posterior meningeal artery from the vertebral artery.7
Ascending Pharyngeal Collaterals
As a remnant of the embryologic hypoglossal artery, the as￾cending pharyngeal artery keeps its connection with the ver￾tebral artery through 2 proximal branches.7,36,37 The lowest,
usually the most proximal branch of the ascending pharyngeal
artery, is the musculospinal branch, which anastomoses later￾ally with the C3 radicular anastomotic artery of the vertebral
artery (Fig 12). The second is the prevertebral branch, located
on the ventral surface of the C1–C2 vertebrae and anastomo￾ses with the odontoid arch.38,39 This branch typically arises
from the neuromeningeal trunk but may also arise directly
from the main ascending pharyngeal artery. It has a character￾istic U-shaped curve, seen on the lateral view before anasto￾mosing medially on the surface of the dens with the C3 collat￾erals from the vertebral artery (Figs 12 and 13).
Cervical Collaterals
The ascending cervical artery and the deep cervical artery are
the major anastomotic channels of the vertebral artery at the
C2–C4 levels (Fig 14).7,40,41 Both arise from the subclavian
arteries. More specifically, the ascending cervical artery typi￾cally originates from the thyrocervical trunk, whereas the deep
cervical artery arises from the costocervical trunk. Several case
reports have described anastomoses between the vertebral ar￾tery and these cervical arteries, including the aberrant origin of
the vertebral artery from the thyrocervical trunk,40 and the use
of these anastomotic channels for thrombolysis of basilar ar￾tery thrombosis in a case with proximal vertebral artery
occlusion.41
Cranial Nerve Supply
The arterial supply of all cranial nerves is summarized in
Table 4.7,42-45 The most important ECA supplies to the cra￾nial nerves are the supplies to CN VII (facial nerve) and the
lower cranial nerves (IXXII). Supply of the geniculate
ganglion of the facial nerve is through the facial arcade,
which, in most of the cases, consists of the petrous branch
Fig 10. Right vertebral artery angiogram in the lateral view, after coiling of a right vertebral
artery aneurysm, reveals anastomosis between the right vertebral artery and the occipital
artery (black arrows) through the posterior radicular branches at the C1 level (white arrow).
Fig 11. Right occipital artery angiograms in lateral (A) and anteroposterior (B) views demonstrate the anastomosis between the occipital artery and the right vertebral artery at the C2
level through the posterior radicular branches (arrows). C, Similar findings are also observed on the contralateral left occipital artery angiogram.

of the MMA and the stylomastoid branch of the posterior
auricular artery (Fig 15). The stylomastoid branch can also
arise from a common trunk of the posterior auricular and
occipital arteries, a variation seen in 50% of patients. Al￾though the cisternal portions of the lower cranial nerves are
supplied from the ipsilateral vertebral arteries, the supply
to their foraminal parts is mainly through the neuromen￾ingeal trunk of the ascending pharyngeal artery, which di￾vides into 2 branches before entering the cranial cavity. The
jugular branch contributes supply to CN IX and X as it
traverses the jugular foramen, and the hypoglossal branch
supplies CN XII within the hypoglossal canal. The supply of
CN XI (accessory spinal nerve), however, is from the mus￾culospinal branch, which arises from the neuromeningeal
trunk before entering the foramen magnum and is proxi￾mal to the odontoid arch. Proximal embolization of these
branches with particles can result in cranial nerve palsies,
which are temporary and can recover following steroid
therapy and with development of collaterals.
On the other hand, distal embolization with either particles
that are smaller than 80 m or liquid materials will lead to
permanent cranial nerve palsy or can even open connections
with the intracranial contributions, (ie, the vertebral artery in
case of the lower cranial nerves via the above-mentioned as￾cending pharyngeal artery anastomoses) and then result in
embolic stroke of the posterior fossa.
Embolic Materials
Particles and liquid embolic materials are the 2 most com￾monly used embolization materials in the ECA system. Al￾though the penetration capacity of particles (the most com￾monly used are Gelfoam sponge and Gelfoam powder
[Gelfoam; Upjohn, Kalamazoo, Mich], and polyvinyl alcohol
particles) is dependent on the size, liquid embolic materials
such as glue (n-butyl 2-cyanoacrylate) and Onyx (ev3, Irvine,
Calif) can open and enter small anastomotic channels that are
not visualized on the initial angiograms and, therefore, should
be used with increased caution.46,47 In general, the size of the

artery (B) angiograms in the lateral view demonstrate the anas￾tomosis of the musculospinal branch of the ascending pharyn￾geal artery (black arrow) to the left vertebral artery at the C3

arrows).

nonvisualized anastomotic arteries ranges from 50 to 80 m;
therefore, particles that are 150 m will not penetrate these
anastomoses and will avoid potential embolic complications.
The visualization of an anastomotic channel is not a contrain￾dication for embolization of the particular artery. There are
several techniques that can be used to prevent embolic mate￾rial from entering the collaterals, including simple proximal
mechanical blockage of the collateral branch with large parti￾cles or coils before the embolization, or flow-reversal methods
using a proximal balloon occlusion in the target ECA vessel,
which leads to flow redirection from the ICA to the ECA
territory.47
Conclusions
Transarterial embolization of the ECA and cervical arteries has
become an established technique in the treatment of tumors
and arteriovenous shunts of the head and neck region. Due to
its embryologic relationship with the intracranial circulation,
Fig 14. Right ascending cervical angiogram in anteroposterior
(A) and lateral (B) views demonstrates anastomosis with the
vertebral artery at the C2 level (black arrows). Note the
inferior thyroidal artery with capillary staining of the thyroid
gland (asterisks), which also arises from the thyrocervical
trunk.

various anastomotic channels exist between the 2 systems,
though they may not be visualized on angiography. Knowl￾edge of these potential anastomotic routes and the proper
choice of embolic material are crucial to help the intervention￾alist avoid embolic complications to the brain and cranial
nerves during the procedure.
