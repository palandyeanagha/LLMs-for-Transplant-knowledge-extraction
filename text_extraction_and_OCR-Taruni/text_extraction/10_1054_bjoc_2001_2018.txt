Hypoxia has been recognized as a key factor involved in the regu￾lation of a cascade of physiological responses such as erythro￾poiesis (Gopfert et al, 1996), glycolysis (Ebert et al, 1996),
glucose transport (Tagaki et al, 1998), angiogenesis and vasodi￾latation (Griffiths et al, 1997; Carmeliet et al, 1998; Faller, 1999).
A large group of genes that includes erythropoietin (Goldberg
et al, 1988), nitric oxide synthase (Palmer et al, 1998), tyrosine
hydroxylase (Norris and Millhorn, 1995), VEGF (Forsythe et al,
1996; Ema et al, 1997), lactate dehydrogenase, haem oxygenase,
transferin receptor and others are regulated by hypoxia (Blancher
and Harris, 1998). Cells, whether normal or malignant, have the
ability to ‘sense’ low oxygen conditions, probably via a haem
flavo-oxido-reductase protein or even through hypoxia-stimulated
release of reactive oxygen species from mitochondria (Chandel
et al, 2000), which activates a signalling pathway for the expres￾sion of the hypoxia-regulated genes. 
HIF1 is a heterodimer of 2 basic-helix-loop-helix PAS domain
proteins; HIF1α (120 kDa protein) and HIF1β (91–94 kDa protein
also called as aryl-hydrocarbon-nuclear receptor translocator,
ARNT1 and 2) (Semenza et al, 1991; Semenza and Wang 1992).
Increased intracellular content of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1
(HIF1) occurs immediately following hypoxia sensing. HIF1β is
present constitutively and usually does not change following
hypoxic stimulation. In contrast, HIF1α levels are maintained at
low levels under normoxic conditions due to continuous degrada￾tion via the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathway (Huang et al,
1996). Hypoxic stimulation results in rapid increase of the HIF1α
protein levels, which is not a result of increased mRNA transcrip￾tion or translation but rather a result of a redox-sensitive stabiliza￾tion (Huang et al, 1998). Following HIF1 heterodimerization the
complex enters into the nucleus and binds to DNA at the hypoxia
response elements (HREs) of target genes. 
More recently new molecules, HIF2α, (or endothelial PAS
domain protein 1, EPAS1 or HIF1α-like factor, HLF) and HIF3α
have been identified with very similar characteristics to HIF1α in
dimerization with HIF1β and DNA binding (Ema et al, 1997; Gu
et al, 1998). HIF2 regulates, similarly to HIF1, the transcription of
hypoxia-regulated genes such as VEGF and the endothelial cell￾specific receptor tyrosine kinase gene Tie-2 (Tian et al, 1997).
HIF2α was believed to be specifically expressed in endothelial
cells and is an important molecule during vasculogenesis (Tian 
et al, 1997). A recent study, however, showed that HIF2α is also
expressed in fibroblasts and in epithelial cells (Wiesner et al, 1998).

Summary Hypoxia inducible factors HIF1α and HIF2α are important proteins involved in the regulation of the transcription of a variety of
genes related to erythropoiesis, glycolysis and angiogenesis. Hypoxic stimulation results in rapid increase of the HIF1α and 2α protein levels,
as a consequence of a redox-sensitive stabilization. The HIFαs enter the nucleus, heterodimerize with the HIF1β protein, and bind to DNA at
the hypoxia response elements (HREs) of target genes. In this study we evaluated the immunohistochemical expression of these proteins in
108 tissue samples from non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and in normal lung tissues. Both proteins showed a mixed cytoplasmic/nuclear
pattern of expression in cancer cells, tumoural vessels and tumour-infiltrating macrophages, as well as in areas of metaplasia, while normal
lung components showed negative or very weak cytoplasmic staining. Positive HIF1α and HIF2α expression was noted in 68/108 (62%) and
in 54/108 (50%) of cases respectively. Correlation analysis of HIF2α expression with HIF1α expression showed a significant association (P <
0.0001, r = 0.44). A strong association of the expression of both proteins with the angiogenic factors VEGF (P < 0.004), PD-ECGF (P < 0.003)
and bFGF (P < 0.04) was noted. HIF1α correlated with the expression of bek-bFGF receptor expression (P = 0.01), while HIF2α was
associated with intense VEGF/KDR-activated vascularization (P = 0.002). HIF2α protein was less frequently expressed in cases with a
medium microvessel density (MVD); a high rate of expression was noted in cases with both low and high MVD (P = 0.006). Analysis of overall
survival showed that HIF2α expression was related to poor outcome (P = 0.008), even in the group of patients with low MVD (P = 0.009).
HIF1α expression was marginally associated with poor prognosis (P = 0.08). In multivariate analysis HIF2α expression was an independent
prognostic indicator (P = 0.006, t-ratio 2.7). We conclude that HIF1α and HIF2α overexpression is a common event in NSCLC, which is
related to the up-regulation of various angiogenic factors and with poor prognosis. Targeting the HIF pathway may prove of importance in the
treatment of NSCLC. © 2001 Cancer Research Campaign http://www.bjcancer.com

In the present study we examined the expression patterns of
HIF1α and of HIF2α in normal lung and in a series of non-small￾cell lung carcinomas. The expression of HIFs was analysed in
comparison with the microvessel density, with the expression of
multiple angiogenic factors and receptors as well as with the
expression of onco-proteins, previously shown to have a role in
lung cancer. The prognostic role of HIF expression was also
studied. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
We examined 108 tumour samples from patients with early oper￾able (T1,2-N0,1-M0 staged) non-small-cell lung cancer (72 squa￾mous and 36 adenocarcinomas). 12 samples from normal lung
obtained during thoracic surgery for reasons other than lung
cancer were also examined. Histological diagnosis, grading and N￾stage was done on haematoxylin-eosin stained sections. 48
patients had T1-stage and 60 T2-stage disease. Node involvement
(N1-stage) was present in 34/108 patients. Histological grade 3
was noted in 59/108 and grade 1/2 in 49/108 patients. 84 patients
were male and 24 female, their ages ranging from 35 to 74 years
(median 63). Survival data (overall survival) were available in
98/108 patients. Patients dying within 60 days after operation were
excluded, so as to avoid bias from perioperative death. The follow￾up of surviving patients at the time of analysis was 621–2500 days
(median 1720 days). 
Assessment of HIF1α and HIF2α protein expression 
The HIF1α and HIF2α proteins were detected using the ESEE 122
(IgG1 Mab; dilution 1:20) and the EP190b (IgG1 Mab; neat) as we
previously described (Wiesner et al, 1998; Talks et al, 2000).
Sections were deparaffinized and peroxidase was quenched with
methanol and H2
O2 3% for 15 minutes. Microwaving for antigen
retrieval was used (3 × 4 min). The primary antibodies were
applied for 90 minutes. Following washing with TBS, sections
were incubated with a secondary anti-rabbit anti-mouse antibody
(Kwik Biotinylated Secondary, 0.69A Shandon-Upshaw) for 15
min and washed in TBS. Kwik Streptavidin peroxidase reagent
(039A Shandon-Upshaw) was applied for 15 min and sections
were again washed in TBS. The colour was developed by 15 min
incubation with DAB solution and sections were weakly counter￾stained with haematoxylin. Breast cancer tissue sections with
strong nuclear HIF1α and HIF2α expression were used as positive
controls. Normal mouse immunoglobulin-G was substituted for
primary antibody as the negative control (same concentration as
the test antibody). 
The percentage of cells expressing HIF1α or HIF2α in the cyto￾plasm and in the nuclei was separately assessed. The intensity of
the cytoplasmic staining was also scored as absent, weak,
moderate and strong. 
Assessment of microvessel density 
The JC70 monoclonal antibody (DAKO) recognizing the CD31
pan-endothelial antigen (platelet/endothelial cell adhesion mole￾cule; PECAM-1) was used for microvessel and single endothelial
cell staining on 5 µm paraffin-embedded sections. We used the
alkaline phosphatase/anti-alkaline phosphatase (APAAP) proce￾dure as previously described (Giatromanolaki et al, 1998).
Sections were dewaxed, rehydrated and pre-digested with protease
type XXIV for 20 min at 37˚C. JC70 (1:50) was applied at room
temperature for 30 min and washed in TBS. Rabbit anti-mouse
antibody 1:50 (v/v) was applied for 30 min, followed by applica￾tion of mouse APAAP complex 1:1 (v/v) for 30 min. After
washing in TBS, the last 2 steps were repeated for 10 min each.
The colour was developed by 20 min incubation with New
Fuchsin solution. 
Microvessel counting was used for angiogenesis assessment. For
eye appraisal sections were scanned at low power (× 40 and × 100)
and afterwards at × 200 field so as to group cases in 3 vascular
grade categories (low, medium and high). The areas of the highest
vascularization were chosen at low power (× 100) and microvessel
counting followed on 3 chosen × 200 fields of the highest density.
The microvessel score (MS) was the sum of the vessel counts
obtained in these 3 fields. Microvessels adjacent to normal lung
were excluded from the appraisal. Vessels with a clearly defined
lumen or well defined linear vessel shape but not single endothe￾lial cells were taken into account for microvessel counting. 
Assessment of VEGF and of VEGF/KDR-activated
microvessel density 
The VEGF expression was assessed with the VG1 Mab (IgG
isotype) recognizing the 121, 165 and 189 isoforms of VEGF (21).
The VEGF/KDR complex was assessed with the 11β5 Mab, an
IgMµ isotype produced using the VEGF Hu NH2-terminus as an
immunogen (Brekken et al, 1998). Sections were dewaxed, rehy￾drated and microwaving (4 min × 2) for antigen retrieval was
applied. 5 µm paraffin-embedded sections were stained using the
alkaline phosphatase/anti-alkaline phosphatase (APAAP) proce￾dure. The primary Abs (1:4 dilution) were applied at room temper￾ature for 1 hour and washed in TBS. Rabbit anti-mouse antibody
1:50 (v/v) was applied for 30 min, followed by application of
mouse APAAP complex 1:1 (v/v) for 30 min. After washing in
TBS, the last 2 steps were repeated for 10 min each. The colour
was developed by 15 min incubation with Fast red solution and
sections were weakly counterstained with haematoxylin. Non￾specific immunoglobulins were substituted for primary antibody
as negative controls (same concentration as the test antibody). 
The percentage of cancer cells with cytoplasmic VEGF reac￾tivity was assessed by 2 independent observers at × 200 magnifi￾cation as previously reported (Giatromanolaki et al, 1998). The
VEGF/KDR-positive microvessel density (activated MVD,
aMVD) was assessed at the tumoural invading front as previously
reported (Koukourakis et al, 2000). 
Assessment of thymidine phosphorylase expression 
Thymidine phosphorylase (TP; platelet-derived endothelial cell
growth factor, PD-ECGF) expression was assessed with the P￾GF.44C monoclonal antibody using the streptavidin-biotin-peroxi￾dase technique as previously described (Koukourakis et al, 1997a).
The percentage of cancer cells with strong cytoplasmic/nuclear
reactivity was recorded. 
Assessment of bFGF and bFGF-Bek-receptor
expression 
The cytoplasmic basic Fibroblast Growth Factor (bFGF) and its
‘bek’ receptor (FGFR-2) expression was assessed in cancer cells,
882 A Giatromanolaki et al

using the APAAP technique. We used the FGF-2 (147)-G and 
the Bek(C-17)-G MAbs respectively (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
as previously reported (Giatromanolaki et al, 2000). The
percentage of cancer cells with positive cytoplasmic reactivity was
recorded.
Assessment of other immunohistochemical variables 
Proliferative index was assessed with the monoclonal antibody
Ki67. Frozen material was taken from 2 separate areas of the
tumour and the Ki67 assessment was based on the average value.
Three groups were considered based on the percent of stained
nuclei: 0–10% = low proliferative index, 10–40% = medium and
> 40% = high (Tungekar et al, 1991). 
The bcl-2 cytoplasmic protein expression and the p53 protein
nuclear accumulation was assessed with the clone 100 (Dako) and
the CM11(Dako) MoAbs respectively, as previously described
(Giatromanolaki et al, 1998). 
The EGFR, c-erbB-2 and episialin MUC-1 expression was also
assessed (data not shown). 
Assessment of necrosis 
The percentage of optical fields ( × 250) with necrosis was
recorded by 3 observers separately. Necrotic areas in more than
50% of the examined fields (mean value of the score given by the
observers) was scored as extensive and, in less than 50%, as limited. 
Statistical analysis 
Statistical analysis and graphic presentation were performed using
the GraphPad Prism 2.01 package (GraphPad, San Diego CA,
www.graphpad.com). The Fisher’s exact test, the chi-square t-test
or the unpaired two-tailed t-test was used for testing relationships
between categorical variables as appropriate. Linear regression
analysis was used to assess correlation between continues vari￾ables. Survival curves were plotted using the method of
Kaplan–Meier, and the log-rank test was used to determine statis￾tical differences between life tables. A Cox proportional hazard
model was used to assess the effects of patient and tumour variables
on overall survival. A P value ≤ 0.05 was considered significant.
RESULTS 
Immunostaining of normal lung and cancer 
Both HIF1α and HIF2α showed a similar pattern of normal tissue
staining. Samples from normal lung and areas distal to the tumour
showed a weak or negative cytoplasmic reactivity of the bronceal
epithelium, while alveolar epithelium and stroma were negative
(Figure 1A). Normal bronchial and alveolar epithelium proximal
to the tumour showed weak or even intense cytoplasmic staining.
Alveolar macrophages and plasma cells in the normal lung were
negative (Figure 1E), while tumour-infiltrating macrophages
(CD68 positive cells identified with immunohistochemistry in
parallel sections) showed intense cytoplasmic and nuclear reac￾tivity (Figure 1F). Chondrocytes persistently showed a pure and
strong nuclear reactivity (Figure 1A), which renders this finding
an internal marker of positive staining. Normal vasculature was
negative, while a strong cytoplasmic and/or nuclear staining of the
endothelium was noted within the tumoural tissue and the invading
front (Figure 1G). Areas of squamous metaplasia showed strong
mixed cytoplasmic/nuclear reactivity (Figure 2A). 
The expression of both HIF1α and HIF2α in cancer cells, both in
adenocarcinomas and squamous tumours, was mixed cytoplasmic
and nuclear (Figures 1C,D and 2B,C) and the percentage of stained
cells was largely varying among cases. The intensity of staining
varied among cases. Absent or weak staining was considered as
negative, while moderate or strong as positive. Cytoplasmic
staining of the stromal fibroblasts also varied among samples.
Scoring of HIF expression in cancer cells 
HIF1α and HIF2α expression was both cytoplasmic and nuclear.
Cytoplasmic staining was scored as absent, weak, moderate and
strong. Nuclear expression, when present, was accompanied with
moderate/strong cytoplasmic reactivity, although pure nuclear
expression was occasionally noted. The extent of staining also
varied among tumours. The percentage of cancer cells with HIF1α
moderate/strong cytoplasmic (and/or nuclear) reactivity ranged
from 0% to 90% (median 80%; mean 63%). The percentage of
HIF2α-positive cancer cells with moderate/strong cytoplasmic
(and/or nuclear) expression ranged from 0% to 90% (median 45%;
mean 43%). 
Tumours were scored in a 3-scale system according to the inten￾sity and extent of staining: score 1, tumours with absent or weak
cytoplasmic reactivity and no nuclear reactivity; score 2, tumours
with moderate/strong cytoplasmic reactivity in a percentage of
cancer cells lower than the mean value and no nuclear reactivity;
score 3, tumours with moderate/strong cytoplasmic reactivity in a
percentage of cancer cells higher than the mean value; score 4,
tumours with a clear nuclear reactivity (with or without cyto￾plasmic reactivity regardless of the intensity). Tumours with score
1 and 2 were grouped as bearing low HIF reactivity, while tumours
with score 2 and 3 as bearing high HIF reactivity. Using these
criteria, 40 cases had low and 68 high HIFα reactivity. 54 cases
had low and 44 had high HIFα reactivity. 
Correlation between HIF1α and HIF2α
Correlation analysis of HIF2α expression with HIF1α expression
showed a significant association (P < 0.0001, r = 0.44). Out of 68
cases with high HIF1α expression 43 (63%) also had high HIF2α
expression, while 11/29 (37%) cases with low HIF1α expression
had high HIF2α expression (P = 0.0006; Fisher’s exact t-test). 
HIF1α/2α and histopathological variables 
HIF2α expression was significantly more frequent in squamous
cell carcinomas than in adenocarcinomas (30/72 vs. 24/36; P =
0.02), while HIF α was not related to histology. Although HIF1α
expression was more frequent in T2 than in T1 stage the difference
was not significant (42/60 (70%) vs. 26/48 (54%); P = 0.11). High
Ki67 proliferation index was not related to either HIF1α and
HIF2α expression (P > 0.81). There was no association of HIF1α
and HIF2α expression with N-stage, histological grade, or the
extent of necrosis (data not shown) 
HIF1α/2α and angiogenic profile of tumours 
Using the 33rd and 66th percentile as cut-off point we grouped
our cases in 3 categories of low, medium and high angiogenic
HIF1α/2α expression in NSCLC 883

factor and receptor expression. For VEGF, low, medium and high
expression refers to 0–30%, 31–69% and 70–100% of cells with
positive reactivity. For TP, low, medium and high expression refer
to 0–10%, 11–49% and 50–100% of cells with strong TP reactivity.
For bFGF, low, medium and high expression refer to 0–59%,
60–79% and 80–100% of cells stained. For bFGF-bek-receptor the
percentage of stained cells used to define low, medium and high
reactivity were 0–9%, 10–20% and > 20% respectively. Cases
with < 4, 4–10 and > 10 VEGF/KDR-positive vessels in the
tumour-invading front (points that correspond to the 33rd and 66th
percentile) were grouped as bearing low, medium and high acti￾vated MVD respectively. Similarly, the 33rd and 66th percentile of

MVD was used to define low (< 32 vessels), medium (33–70
vessels) and high (> 70 vessels) MVD groups. 
Table 1 shows the association of HIF1α and HIF2α expression
with microvessel density and the expression of angiogenic factors
and angiogenic factor receptors. A significant association of both
HIF1α and HIF2α with all 3 angiogenic factors (VEGF, PD-ECGF
and bFGF) examined was noted. 88% and 70% of cases with high
VEGF expression had high HIF1α and HIF2α expression, respec￾tively, vs. 48% (HIF1α) and 38% (HIF2α) of cases with
low/medium VEGF expression (P = 0.0002; Fisher’s exact t￾test). Similar differences were noted for PD-ECGF (thymidine
phosphorylase) and bFGF (P = 0.0004 to 0.006). High bFGF-bek￾receptor (bFGFR) expression was associated with high HIF1α
expression (P = 0.007) but not with HIF2α. On the contrary,
HIF2α expression was strongly associated with the VEGF/KDR￾activated microvessel density in the invading tumour front (P =
0.0009), while HIF1α was not. Combining HIF1α and HIF2α
expression (low/low vs. all others), a very strong association of
HIF overexpression with VEGF (P < 0.0001) and with TP 
(P = 0.0004) was noted (data not shown). 
Cases with high MVD were more frequently of high HIF1α and
HIF2α expression as compared to the group of low/medium MVD,
but the difference did not reach significance (P = 0.18 and 0.08 for
HIF1α and HIF2α, respectively). Of interest, the group of patients
with medium MVD was strongly associated with low HIF2α
expression, while HIF2α expression was similarly high in cases
with low and high MVD (P = 0.01 and 0.008, respectively). 
A continuous variable analysis revealed that the mean percentage
of HIF1α-positive cells (cells with moderate/strong cytoplasmic
reactivity or nuclear expression) in cases with low/medium MVD
was significantly lower than in cases with high MVD (71 ± 15 vs.
60 ± 26; P = 0.03; Figure 3a). Similarly, cases with low/medium
HIF1α/2α expression in NSCLC 885

MVD had a lower percentage of HIF2α-positive cells compared to
cases with high MVD (52 ± 26 vs. 39 ± 32; P = 0.05; Figure 3a)
Further analysis, however, revealed a U-like shaped association of
HIF2α expression with MVD is shown in Figure 3b. Cases with
high and low MVD had a significantly higher percentage of cells
expressing HIF2α as compared to cases with medium MVD. 
HIF1α/2α and other molecular parameters 
A significant inverse association of bcl-2 expression with both
HIF1α and HIF2α was noted (P = 0.02 and 0.005, respectively).
p53 nuclear accumulation was significantly more frequent in the
HIF1α expressing cases (P = 0.04), (Table 2). 
No association of HIF1α and HIF2α with EGFR, c-erb B-2 or
episialine (MUC1) expression was noted (data not shown). A signif￾icant association of HIF2α expression with c-erbB-2 expression was
noted in poorly vascularized cases (P = 0.04; data not shown). 
HIF1α/2α and survival 
Univariate analysis showed that HIF2α expression was signifi￾cantly associated with poor prognosis (P = 0.008), while HIF1α
showed a marginal association (P = 0.08). Figures 4A,B show the
Kaplan–Meier survival curves plotted for HIF1α and HIF2α
expression. The 5 year survival of patients with high HIF2α
expression was 32% vs. 58% of patients with low HIF2a expres￾sion. T,N-stage and MVD were also significantly associated with
survival (P = 0.006, 0.007 and 0.005, respectively). 
We further analysed the survival of patients with low/medium
MVD according to the HIF1α and 2α expression (Figure 5A,B). A
significantly worse prognosis of patients with low/medium MVD
but high HIF2α expression was noted (P = 0.04). This association
was even stronger in patients with low MVD expressing HIF2α
(P = 0.009; Figure 5c). 
Table 3 shows the results obtained from multivariate analysis of
death events in different models including HIFs and the parame￾ters with important prognostic significance in univariate T-stage,
N-stage and microvessel density (MVD). Due to the close associa￾tion of HIF1α and HIF2α with each other and with MVD, as well
as due to the close association of N-stage with MVD, only T-stage
had an independent prognostic significance in the multivariate
model that comprised all the examined parameters. In a multi￾variate model including T-stage, N-stage, MVD and HIF2α expres￾sion we observed that HIF2α had an independent prognostic
meaning (P = 0.005, t-ratio = 2.0). T-stage was also an independent

prognostic variable (P = 0.006, t-ratio = 2.7). N-stage and MVD
did not reach significance (P = 0.13 and 0.12) probably because of
the strong association of the 2 variables with each other. HIF1α
was not revealed as an independent prognostic factor. 
DISCUSSION 
Once transformation has occurred, unrestrained cancer cell growth
without a parallel formation of vessels leads to the establishment
of intratumoral hypoxic conditions. Cells found 100–200 µm away
from blood vessels are already hypoxic (Gatenby et al, 1988),
which suggests that hypoxic conditions will have been established
in a cluster of cells of about 0.5 mm diameter. Activation of the
HIF1 pathway may therefore be expected to occur at a very early
step of tumour progression. Indeed, HIF1 expression was found to be
expressed in in situ carcinomas and also in premalignant conditions
(Zhong et al, 1999). In our study we found areas of bronchial
metaplasia which exhibited strong staining of both nuclei and
cytoplasm. This may be due to early hypoxia, but other mecha￾nisms such as the effects of cytokines e.g. TNFα or growth factors
may be responsible. Since HIF1 and HIF2 stabilization up-regulates
the expression of angiogenic and glycolytic pathways to restore
oxygen homeostasis, HIFs may have an important role for the
survival and growth of cancer. Indeed, recent experimental studies
confirm that HIFs modulate gene expression resulting in increased
angiogenesis and tumoural growth (Jiang et al, 1997; Maxwell
et al, 1997). 
The significance of HIFs expression in human tumours remains
largely unexplored as monoclonal antibodies available for
immunohistochemistry have been only recently developed. Zhong
et al recently reported on the expression of HIF1α in a panel of
normal human tissues and benign or malignant tumours and first
showed the expression of the molecule in a good percentage of
human carcinomas (Zhong et al, 1999). However, studies on the
association of HIF1α and 2α expression with angiogenic factors
and receptors, with microvessel density or with other molecular
markers or with prognosis of human carcinomas are few. 
In a study in brain tumours, Zagzag et al observed that HIF1α
and HIF1β expression is expressed around the areas of necrosis
and in the invading front of brain tumours (Zagzag et al, 2000).
These patterns show that, at least in part, HIF1α expression is a result
of differences in tissue oxygenation. In contrast, haemangioblas￾tomas presented a homogeneous expression of HIF1α, suggesting an
oncogenic reason for its up-regulation in this tumour type.
Using 2 novel antibodies for HIF1α and HIF2α (Talks et al,
2000), we focused on lung cancer. Expression of HIF1α and 2α by
cancer cells was mixed nuclear/cytoplasmic, which is in accor￾dance with the staining patterns reported by Zhong et al (1999).
Although it would be assumed that nuclear HIF is the active form,
clearly it is synthesized in the cytoplasm and also degraded in the
cytoplasm. There may be redistribution while collecting tissues,
which would be difficult to control but the overall expression indi￾cates up-regulation of the pathway selectively in cancer. Analysis
based on pure nuclear expression showed very marginal or no
statistical association with other molecular factors or prognosis,
showing that strong cytoplasmic HIF expression, which is a
tumour-specific finding, better reflects the HIF up-regulated
pathway in paraffin-embedded material. This suggestion is in
general accordance with the scoring system proposed by Zhong
et al (1999). HIF1α was more frequently overexpressed in lung
cancer than HIF2α. Although both molecules were more
frequently noted in larger tumours, we found no association of
HIF-positive tumours with high Ki67 proliferation index. A strong
association of high HIF1α and HIF2α expression with the expres￾sion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), thymidine
phosphorylase (TP) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was
confirmed. Bek bFGF-receptor expression was significantly over￾expressed in HIF1α-overexpressing cases, while activated
VEGF/KDR angiogenesis was strongly related to HIF2α expres￾sion by cancer cells.

There was a strong association of HIF expression with multiple
angiogenic factors and receptors so a higher MVD was expected in
HIF-overexpressing cases. This was the case for HIF2α which was
associated with up-regulation of VEGF and its receptor but not for
HIF1α where the association was weaker for VEGF and not found
for its receptor. For HIF1α there was an association with up-regu￾lation of bFGF and its receptor in contrast to HIF2α. These results
will need to be confirmed but do suggest that each HIF may regu￾late some pathways more than others and may explain the exis￾tence of 2 such similar factors. 
Although the chi-squared test shows a significant association of
HIF2α with MVD (P = 0.006), closer inspection showed a more
complicated relationship. HIF2α was higher in cases with high or
low MVD but was significantly lower in cases with a medium
degree of vascularization. This U-like-shaped association of HIF2α
with MVD is in accordance with previous studies of ours where not
all VEGF-, TP- or bFGF-expressing tumours show an increase in
angiogenesis (Koukourakis et al, 1997b, 2000; Giatromanolaki
et al, 1998, 2000). We suggest that although hypoxia triggers the
expression of a cascade of angiogenic factors through HIF stabi￾lization, the process of angiogenesis is subject to other modulators.
Strong expression of endogenous inhibitors of angiogenesis
produced by cancer or stromal cells may therefore counter the
effectiveness of the angiogenic cascade released by HIFs (Dong
et al, 1997; Koukourakis et al, 1998), while a moderate vasculariza￾tion may be enough for the restoration of oxygenation that may
bring the HIF levels close to the normal level. HIF levels are
normalized within minutes after the restoration of oxygenation
(Wiesner et al, 1998). The presistent HIF expression in a group of
highly angiogenic tumours may show an aggressive phenotype
with high oxygen consumption as a result of the transformation
itself and not of the hypoxic environment. For example, VHL
mutations (Maxwell et al, 1999), activation of HIFs by MAP
kinases (Mazure et al, 1999) or the IGF1 pathway (Feldser et al,
1999; Zundel et al, 2000) may be involved in the persistent HIF
induction despite the restoration of oxygenated conditions. 
Survival analysis showed that HIF2α expression was signifi￾cantly associated with worse prognosis, which was independent of
the MVD. Indeed, stratification of poorly vascularized tumours
according to HIF2α expression showed a poorer prognosis of
patients with HIF2α overexpression. Patients bearing tumours
with low MVD and high HIF1α expression also did worse, but the
difference was not significant. These findings show that HIFs may
have an important role in tumour progression distinct from angio￾genesis. The activation of the glycolytic pathway and increased
glucose transport may give a survival and growth advantage to
cancer cells growing in hypoxic conditions. A significantly poorer
prognosis of patients with early stage HIF1α positive cervical
cancer has been also reported by Birner et al (2000), while a puta￾tive role of HIF1α in defining poor response to radiotherapy and
poor outcome has been reported in a more recent study (Aebersold
et al, 2001). In contrast to these studies, Volm et al (2001) found 
a significant association of HIF1α with a better survival in 
non-small-cell lung cancer. Although difficult to explain this 
later observation, an eventual U-like association of HIFs with
angiogenesis (intense expression in tumours with very low and
with very high angiogenesis) noted in our study shows that the
prognostic role of HIFs in human malignancies may be more
complicated. 
Although, Zhong et al found a significant association of HIF1α
expression with Ki67 proliferation index (Zhong et al, 1999), we
could not confirm this finding in the present study. Studies on
apoptotic index may be useful in identifying a survival advantage
conferred by HIFs. We also assessed whether HIF expression was
associated with activated migration pathways such as c-erbB-2,
EGFR and MUC1/episialin expression. Although such an associa￾tion was not confirmed overall, analysis in the group of patients
with poor vascularization showed a significant association of
HIF2α expression with c-erbB-2 overexpression (P = 0.04, data
not shown). C-erbB-2 is involved in epithelial cell migration and
hypoxia has been shown to induce keratinocyte motility (de-Porter
et al, 1994; O’Toole et al, 1997). Whether HIF expression acti￾vates migration-related pathways is unknown, but the observed
association of HIF2α expression with c-erbB-2 supports our
previous findings that c-erbB-2 defines a group of poorly vascular￾ized tumours associated with poor prognosis (Giatromanolaki
et al, 1996). A similar association (although of borderline signifi￾cance, between c-erbB-2 and HIF1a expression has been recently
reported in breast cancer (Boss et al, 2001). 
Comparative analysis of bcl-2 and HIF expression showed a
significant inverse association of both HIF1α and of HIF2α with
bcl-2 expression. A similar association has been reported by
Zhong et al (1999). In previous studies we showed that bcl-2
expression cancer is associated with poor vascularization in lung
and endometrial cancer (Koukourakis et al, 1997; Giatromanolaki
et al, 1999) and also in breast cancer (unpublished data). We also
reported an inverse association of bcl-2 expression with both
VEGF and TP expression (Koukourakis et al, 2000). Indeed, in
this study only 3/18 bcl-2-positive tumours had high MVD. All
these 3 cases had high HIF expression (P = 0.06; data not shown).
The inverse association of bcl2 with HIF stabilization may be
because such tumours are characterized by a less aggressive
growth, which explains the excellent survival reported in patients
with bcl-2-overexpressing lung carcinomas (Koukourakis et al,
1997, 2000). There may therefore be much less oxygen consump￾tion and less metabolically driven hypoxia and, therefore, less
induction of HIF. The marginal direct association of HIF1α with
p53 nuclear accumulation observed in this study and in the study
by Zhong et al (1999) may be due to co-induction of both by
hypoxia or stabilizing interactions of both proteins. 
We conclude that HIF1α and 2α expression is a common event
in lung cancer, which occurs early in the development of the
disease as shown by the strong expression in areas of metaplasia.
The HIF pathway may therefore be a useful marker in assessing
risk of malignancy and will be of interest to assess how this relates
to progression and invasion. The HIF transcription pathway may
also be a target for cancer prevention. Strong expression of both
HIF1α and 2α was related to up-regulation of multiple angiogenic
factors and overexpression of angiogenic receptors by cancer cells
and the endothelium. HIF2α overexpression showed a strong asso￾ciation with poor survival, even in poorly vascularized cases.
Therefore, HIFs confer aggressive tumour behaviour through both
angiogenic-dependent and -independent pathways. Targeting the
HIF pathway may prove of importance in the treatment of non￾small-cell lung cancer.
