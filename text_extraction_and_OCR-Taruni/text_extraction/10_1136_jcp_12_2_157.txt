BY
R. LANNIGAN AND M. J. MEYNELL
From the Department of Pathology, University of Birmingham, and the Department of Clinical
Pathology, General Hospital, Birmingham
(RECEIVED FOR PUBLICATION SEPTEMBER 8, 1958)
The prolonged use of antibiotics, cortisone, or
a combination of both has resulted in an increase
in infections with monilia. With the recent
advances in the treatment of acute leukaemia
to include anti-metabolites, corticoids, and
antibiotics, an increased incidence of monilial
infections might be expected. This paper reports
the clinical and necropsy findings in five cases of
acute leukaemia with moniliasis which have
occurred at this hospital during the past two years.
Four of these were treated with 6-mercaptopurine
(6-M.P.), corticoids, and antibiotics. The fifth
was untreated in hospital, but probably received
antibiotics for some time before admission.
Case Reports
Case 1.-D. P., a woman aged 59 years, a laundress,
was first admitted on September 7, 1955, complaining
of dyspnoea, fatigue, and sore throat. A blood
count showed: haemoglobin 7.7 g. per 100 ml., white
blood cells 12,000 per c.mm., platelets 26,000 per
c.mm. A differential count showed 50% myeloblasts.
Procaine-penicillin, 100,000 units b.d., 6-M.P.,
25 mg. five times daily, and cortisone, 50 mg. b.d.,
were given. Because of a falling blood count 6-M.P.
was reduced to 25 mg. b.d. and terramycin, 250 mg.
six-hourly, was substituted for penicillin. Broncho￾pneumonia developed and the antibiotic was changed
to erythromycin, 2 g. daily. The patient was
discharged much improved on 6-M.P., 25 mg. b.d.,
and prednisone, 25 mg. b.d.
She was admitted the second time on January 12,
1956, complaining of sore throat. A blood count
showed: haemoglobin 10 g. %, white blood cells 2,300
per c.mm., with a normal differential count. The
patient died four days after admission.
Necropsy.-There was purpura of the arms and
extensive ulceration and crusting with a yellowish￾white membrane on the posterior third of the
tongue, epiglottic folds, pharynx, and oesophagus.
There were submucosal haemorrhages in the stomach
and intestines, and extensive bronchopneumonia.
The red marrow occupied the entire femoral shaft.
Findings in the other organs were not relevant.
Histology. - The oesophagus was extensively
ulcerated with numerous mycelia on the surface and
in the deeper tissues. The inflammatory exudate was
largely lymphocytic and mononuclear, but occasional
polymorphs were present. The lungs showed
suppurative bronchopneumonia, but fungi were not
detected in the lesions. The bone marrow was
extensively replaced by leukaemic cells, but they
had not infiltrated the liver, spleen, or kidneys.
The spleen showed numerous iron-containing
maciophages.
Case 2.-N. K., a woman aged 45, a housewife,
was first admitted on October 28, 1955, as an
emergency with prolapsed bleeding piles. A blood
count showed: haemoglobin 8.9 g. per 100 ml.; white
blood cells 1,900 per c.mm., platelets 36,000 per
c.mm., and a differential count, showing granulopenia
with 17% lymphoblasts. A marrow puncture showed
75 % lymphoblasts.
Treatment was with blood transfusions, 6-M.P.,
50 mg. b.d., and prednisone, 5 mg. six-hourly. A small
but definite haematological improvement occurred,
and the patient was discharged still receiving 6-M.P.,
50 mg. b.d., and prednisone, 25 mg. b.d. She was
admitted for the second time in December 7, 1955,
complaining of pyrexia, diarrhoea, and sore throat.
The epiglottis and soft palate were diffusely
ulcerated, and cultures produced a profuse growth
of Monilia albicans. The blood picture showed a
relapse which was treated with blood transfusions,
and the dosage of 6-M.P. reduced to 25 mg. daily.
One per cent. gentian violet was applied locally to
the mouth, and achromycin, 1 g. daily, was given
because of pyrexia. She was discharged clinically
and haematologically improved. She remained well
as an out-patient on 6-M.P., 25 mg. daily, and
prednisone, 20 mg. daily. She was finally admitted
on June 6, 1956, with a recurrence of the
haemorrhoids and laryngitis, and a haematological
relapse. Monilia was not isolated from repeated
swabs of the mouth. Treatment was with blood
transfusions, penicillin, 1 mega unit daily,
tetracycline, 1 g. daily, 6-M.P., 25 mg. daily, and
prednisone, 20 mg. daily, but there was no response
and the patient died on July 1, 1956.
Necropsy.-There were ecchymoses on the arms
and legs, and firm, yellowish, raised plaques and
ulcerated areas on the posterior third of the tongue,
tonsils, larynx, and oesophagus. Ulcers with raised
edges and yellowish, necrotic centres were found inProtected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies.

the stomach, duodenum, small intestine, and, to a ..a
lesser extent, in the ascending colon. Massive
haemorrhage had occurred into the wall of the* _L
caecum and the retroperitoneal tissues. The liver was U I W a
enlarged and pale with numerous firm, yellowish
nodules approximately 1 cm. in diameter in both
lobes. The spleen was enlarged (300 g.) and brown.
The lymph nodes were not enlarged. The bone
marrow was red in the upper third of the shaft of W 0
the femur. There were no other relevant findings.
Histology.-The oesophageal lesions were similar
to those in Case 1. The ulcers in the stomach and 4
intestines showed necrosis in the centre with
numerous fungi on the surface and in the deeper *
tissues. At the margins of the ulcers, areas of
necrosis were present in the submucosa and these g
also contained large numbers of mycelia (Fig. 1).@ *
The cellular reaction consisted of lymphocytes, t
histiocytes, and occasional plasma cells. Many cells
showed pyknosis and karyorrhexis and it is possible -_
that some were leukaemic. The nodules in the liver
consisted of extensive areas of necrosis with a _
cellular exudate of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and
mononuclears (Fig. 2). Mycelia and yeast forms
were found in large numbers. The nodules were
sharply demarcated from the surrounding liver tissue
and in some there was early fibrosis at the periphery.v $ '

He was admitted for the third time on January 30,
1956, with an indolent leg ulcer, still in a
haematological remission. He was continued on
6-M.P. and cortisone. The patient was admitted for
the fourth time on May 11, 1956, with a cervical
abscess from a septic tooth. He was treated with
achromycin, 250 mg. six-hourly. The abscess slowly
subsided, but the blood picture showed a relapse. He
was discharged on cortisone and 6-M.P. He was
finally admitted on August 9, 1956, acutely ill. He
had pains in the chest, the liver was enlarged and
tender, and the blood picture showed a relapse.
Treatment was continued, but he deteriorated and
died on September 4.
Necropsy.-There was diffuse brown pigmentation
of the skin and multiple petechial haemorrhages.
The fauces, uvula, epiglottis, and upper half of the
oesophagus showed extensive ulceration and a
yellowish white membrane on the surface. The
stomach contained four small ulcers with raised edges.
The intestines were normal. The liver was grossly
enlarged and contained multiple yellowish nodules,
1-2 cm. in diameter. The right lobe contained a large
yellowish mass, 12 cm. in diameter. The spleen
showed yellowish nodules, 2-3 cm. in diameter.
Similar rounded nodules, 1 cm. in diameter, were
found in the lungs, especially at the periphery. The
upper two-thirds of the femur contained reddish
marrow. There were no other relevant findings.

Case 3. Haematoxylin and eosin x 25.
Histology.-The lesions in the oesophagus and
stomach were similar to those in Case 2. The liver
nodules showed zones of necrosis and a cellular
exudate of mononuclears and lymphocytes.
Numerous mycelia and yeast forms were found in the
necrotic areas and between the cells (Fig. 3). As in
Case 2 there was extensive pyknosis and karyorrhexis
(Fig. 4). The large nodule in the right lobe showed
similar appearances to the smaller nodules, but there
was much more cellular reaction. There was no
evidence of leukaemic infiltration in other parts of
the liver. The nodules of the spleen showed a
structure similar to those in the liver (Fig. 5).
Numerous iron-containing phagocytes were present,
but there was no evidence of leukaemic infiltration.
The nodules in the lungs appeared similar to those in
liver and spleen, but there was more cellular necrosis
(Fig. 6). Numerous mycelia and yeast forms were
present. A cervical lymph node showed necrosis, and
fungi could be demonstrated in small numbers. The
marrow was extremely hypoplastic and contained
numerous iron-containing phagocytes.
Case 4.-J. W., a woman aged 57, a housewife, was
first admitted on April 15, 1955, complaining of
dyspnoea, fatigue, and pain in the chest for two
days. The temperature was 102° F., and she had a
left lower lobe pneumonia. A blood count showed:
haemoglobin 9.5 g. per 100 ml., white blood cells
5,300 per c.mm., and a differential count showed
1.5% myeloblasts. She was treated with penicillin,
1 mega unit, and terramycin, 2 g. daily, for one week.
A tentative diagnosis of diffuse carcinoma was made
because of the blood picture. The patient improved
and was discharged.
She was admitted finally on September 1, 1956,
complaining of lassitude and mouth ulcers. A blood
count gave: haemoglobin 4.4 g. per 100 ml., white
blood cells 550 per c.mm., platelets 10,000 per c.mm.;
blood films showed 1 % pre-myelocytes. Sternal
marrow showed 38% myeloblasts.
She was treated with blood transfusions,
oxytetracycline, 1 g., cortisone, 100 mg., and 6-M.P.,
50 mg. daily. A throat swab on September 29
showed a moderate growth of Monilia albicans, which
was treated locally with 1% gentian violet and
" nystatin," one tablet (500,000 units) four times a
day. The patient died two days later.
Necropsy. The tonsils, epiglottis, and upper
two-thirds of the oesophagus were ulcerated and
covered with a firm, yellowish membrane. The
stomach and colon were normal. Three ulcers with
long axis transverse were found in the small intestine.
One small subcapsular nodule was present in the liver.
The lungs showed an extensive bronchopneumonia.
The hilar and cervical lymph nodes were enlarged
and necrotic. The upper two-thirds of the femur
contained reddish-brown marrow. There were no
other relevant findings.
Histology.-The lesions in the oesophagus and
small intestine were similar to those in Cases 2 and 3,
and many mycelia were present in the lesions. The
subcapsular nodule of the liver was entirely necrotic.
Fungi were not demonstrated. There was no
evidence of leukaemic infiltration. Extensive
suppurative bronchopneumonia with no demonstrable
fungi was found. Extensive necrosis was found
in the hilar and cervical lymph nodes, but fungi
were not demonstrated. Numerous iron-containing
phagocytes were in the spleen, but no evidence of
leukaemic infiltration was found. The bone marrow
was hypoplastic.
Case 5.-H. S., a woman aged 64, a housewife,
was admitted on May 26, 1957, complaining of
anorexia, loss of weight, and sore throat. She had
been treated at home for pneumonia, but the
treatment was not known. She had extensive
moniliasis of the tongue and palate. A blood count
showed: haemoglobin 6.4 g. per 100 ml., white blood
cells 600 per c.mm. A differential count showed 20%
monoblasts. The sternal marrow was hypercellular
with 65% of cells of the monocytic series. The
patient died four days after admission. No specific
treatment was given.
Necropsy.-A few small areas of pale, white
crusting were found on the anterior surface of the
tongue, soft palate, and uvula. The oesophagus was
extensively involved by similar lesions. The stomach
and small intestine were normal, but extensive

superficial ulceration was present in the rectum. The
liver was pale but not enlarged. The spleen was
normal. The cervical and para-aortic lymph nodes
were enlarged. The marrow was pale brown in the
upper half of the shaft of the femur. There were no
other relevant findings.
Histology.-The oesophageal and rectal lesions
appeared similar to those described in Cases 2 and 3.
The liver, spleen, and kidneys showed no evidence
of leukaemic infiltration. Reactive hyperplasia was
present in the lymph nodes and the bone marrow was
extensively replaced by leukaemic cells.
Discussion
Histology of the Monilial Lesions.-Nearly all
the lesions showed necrosis, and the liver nodules
in Case 2 were the only examples where fibrosis
was noted at the periphery. The extent of the
cellular reaction varied from case to case, but
was predominantly lymphocytic and mononuclear
with variable numbers of plasma cells. In Case 2
there is a possibility that some of the cells were
leukaemic. Giant cells and foam cells as
described by Ruhrmann and Adam (1955) were
not found. Mycelia and yeast forms were
demonstrated in large numbers within the lesions.
The organisms were readily detected in routine
haematoxylin and eosin preparations, but were
more easily found with the periodic-acid-Schiff
reagent. In all cases except Case 1 the fungi
were identified by culture either during life or
post mortem. In the gastro-intestinal tract the
fungi were sometimes confined to the surface but
often were found deeply in the tissues. Torack
(1957) observed in his cases that with antibiotics
alone the fungi were frequently confined to the
surface in gastro-intestinal lesions, whereas in the
patients receiving corticoids and antibiotics they
had often penetrated to the deeper tissues. The
possibility of secondary infection of leukaemic
deposits was considered, but, as all lesions
examined had large numbers of monilia and no
uninvolved leukaemic deposits were detected, this
appears to be unlikely.
Relation of Moniliasis to Treatment.-These
five cases are the only examples of moniliasis in
the necropsy records of thz General Hospital,
Birmingham, for the last 10 years. During this
period necropsies have been performed on 69
cases of leukaemia, 51 of which were considered
to be acute. Twelve of these cases had been
treated with 6-M.P., corticoids, and antibiotics for
varying periods and four showed moniliasis at
necropsy. Moniliasis was encountered only once
(Case 5) in the other cases, either having no
specific treatment, antibiotics alone, or cortisone
and antibiotics. Moniliasis was not encountered
in a series of 55 necropsies on patients treated
with prolonged cortisone therapy for various
diseases, and half of these patients were also
receiving antibiotics (Dr. K. R. Thornton, 1958,
personal communication).
Since the introduction of antibiotics there has
been an increased number of reported cases of
gastro-intestinal and visceral involvement with
monilia (Taylor and Rundle, 1952; Brown,
Propp, Guest, Beebe, and Early, 1953; Schaberg,
Hildes, and Wilt, 1955; Matthias and Rees,
1956). Occasional reports have appeared of
moniliasis developing during cortisone therapy
(Soffer, Levitt, and Baehr, 1950; Levy and
Cohen, 1955), or after cortisone and antibiotics
(Torack, 1957). A few cases of generalized
moniliasis have been reported in leukaemias
(Stenderup, Bichel, and Kissmeyer-Nielsen, 1956;
Torack, 1957), and Zimmerman (1950) refers to
seven cases of generalized moniliasis seen by Dr.
Farber in children. Although full details of these
seven cases have not apparently been published,
five were of acute leukaemia treated with folic
acid antagonists and antibiotics.
In view of the multiple therapeutic agents
employed in four of the present cases and the
debilitating type of disease, it is not possible to
incriminate any particular group of drugs.
Experimental evidence of an enhancing effect on
the pathogenicity of monilia in experimental
animals has been produced by Seligmann (1952)
and Winter and Foley (1956). An enhancing
effect of cortisone has been shown by Syverton
et al. (1952), Seligmann (1953), and Winter and
Foley (1956), but Winner (1958) believes that
cortisone has no such effect. We have been
unable to find experimental evidence on the effect
of 6-mercaptopurine on monilia infections, but the
high incidence of moniliasis in patients treated
with 6-M.P., cortisone, and antibiotics suggests
that 6-M.P. may further increase the risk of
disseminated fungus infections.
Conclusion
Antibiotics, particularly of the broad range
type, e.g., tetracyclines, should be used for limited
periods only in acute leukaemia, and antifungal
agents such as " nystatin " may be of value in
preventing gastro-intestinal and generalized
moniliasis.
We wish to thank the physicians of the General
Hospital, Birmingham, for access to the clinical
records.
