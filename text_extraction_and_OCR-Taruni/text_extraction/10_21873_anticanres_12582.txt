Abstract. Background/Aim: Tumor recurrence complicates
more than half of patients at 5 years after primary
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) resection. Repeat open
liver resection (ROLR) is the standard procedure for patients
eligible for repeat resection, whereas laparoscopic repeat
liver resection (RLLR) has been proposed as an alternative
approach. The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate
studies reporting on outcomes of RLLR for recurrent HCC
(rHCC). Materials and Methods: A comprehensive search of
the literature was undertaken. Results: A total of 11 studies,
6 non-comparative and 5 comparative (RLLR versus ROLR),
which reported outcomes for 165 patients who underwent
RLLR, were included in our review. RLLRs were associated
with reduced blood loss, shorter hospital stay, lower
conversion to ROLR and lower morbidity rates. Conclusion:
Selected patients with rHCC who undergo RLLR, benefit in
terms of short-term outcomes. Larger prospective trials will
elucidate the impact of RLLR on long-term outcomes and
establish treatment guidelines.
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has risen in frequency and
has become the 6th most common neoplasm and the 3rd
most frequent cause of cancer death (1). Laparoscopic liver
resections (LLR) are currently acknowledged as safe and
efficient procedures in the hands of hepatobiliary surgeons
with experience in laparoscopic surgery (2, 3). Multiple
studies and meta-analyses have demonstrated that LLR is a
safe and adequate approach for the treatment of HCC (4-9).
Moreover, during the years, major resections, resection in
challenging liver locations as well as resections in high-risk
patient groups including cirrhotic and geriatric patients are
increasingly performed with equally outstanding short- and
long-term outcomes (10-12).
Tumor recurrence has been demonstrated to be as high as
30-70% at 5 years after primary HCC resection and is a
critical parameter that limits the overall survival of these
patients (13, 14). Most centers advocate repeat liver resection
when patient status allows it although no established
guideline exists as in the case of primary HCC (15). Repeat
open liver resection (ROLR) is currently established as a
method of choice with acceptable morbidity, mortality and
long-term survival rates which have also proved comparable
to those of initial liver surgery (14, 16). Innovations in the
field of laparoscopic surgery and the gradual accrual of
experience with laparoscopic techniques have allowed the
implementation of laparoscopic surgery in the challenging
treatment of recurrent HCC (rHCC). Several studies have
been published reporting on results of repeat laparoscopic
liver resection (RLLR) in patients with rHCC (17-19).
The objective of the present systematic review was to
identify and evaluate available data on the efficacy of RLLR
for rHCC.
Materials and Methods
A comprehensive search of the Medline (PubMed), Embase and
Cochrane libraries was undertaken separately by three authors (NM,
PS, DP) with the intent to identify non-comparative studies
reporting outcomes for LLR in rHCC and studies comparing open
surgery to laparoscopic in the setting of rHCC, published in English
language. The terms utilized were “recurrent HCC”, “recurrent

hepatocellular carcinoma”, “recurrent hepatoma” combined with
“laparoscopic liver resection”, “laparoscopic hepatectomy”,
“laparoscopic surgery” and “open surgery”, using the Boolean
operators AND, OR. The abstracts of the articles yielded by the
database search were screened in order to identify observational
studies (prospective and retrospective) eligible for inclusion. The
eligibility criteria defined by the authors were: English language,
full-text articles and studies including a minimum of 3 patients. The
exclusion criteria were: studies with incomplete data on patients and
procedures, case-reports/reviews/letters and editorials, studies that
included patients undergoing procedures other than resection (such
as radiofrequency ablation or transplantation), duplicate studies and
studies concerning re-resection of metastatic malignancies (colon or
elsewhere). All articles deemed eligible for inclusion were
subsequently reviewed by all authors and were selected for
inclusion in the data analysis. This study was conducted according
to PRISMA guidelines (20).
Data extraction and management. Data extracted from eligible
studies and were inserted in Excel spreadsheets (Microsoft,
Redmond, Washington, USA). Data of interest were patient
demographics, information on patient cirrhosis status, status of
previous abdominal operation and intra-, peri- and post-operative
outcomes.
Results
The PubMed database search yielded a total of 42 articles.
Review of the abstracts identified 15 studies for full-text
evaluation. Four studies were excluded under the criteria stated
above. Eleven studies were finally included in the present
review. Among them, 6 studies were (17, 21-25) non￾comparative and presented outcomes concerning the efficacy of
RLLR for rHCC while 5 studies (19, 26-28) were comparative
and evaluated the efficacy of ROLR compared with RLLR for
rHCC. The PRISMA search flow chart is shown in Figure 1.
Non-comparative studies reporting outcomes of RLLR. A total
of 6 non-comparative studies, which comprised 40 patients
and reported outcomes for the efficacy and safety of RLLR
in the setting of rHCC were included in the present review as
shown in Table I. All 6 studies were single-center
retrospective and 1 study was a case-series involving 3
patients (25). The aforementioned studies included patients
assessed and operated on from the year 2004 to 2017. No
studies including patients undergoing re-resection of HCC
were identified prior to the year 2004. Among the included
patients, 39 underwent resections through a pure laparoscopic
technique while one resection was performed using the hand￾assisted technique. Perioperative data are summarized on
Table II. The exact type of resection is described for 32
patients. In particular, all laparoscopic resections in the non￾comparative studies were minor liver resections, involving 2
or less liver segments. The operative time ranged from 75 to
343 minutes, while blood loss during surgery ranged from 75
to 283 ml. Adhesions encountered during surgery were graded
using the scale described by Becker et al. (29). The severity
of adhesions was graded in 4 of the 6 non-comparative
studies. Grade 3 or 4 peritoneal adhesions were encountered
in 16/29 (55%) of patients. Conversion from laparoscopic to
open approach was required in 2 out of 40 cases (5%).
Margin positivity status was reported in 3 out of 6 studies.
No case of macroscopic or microscopic positive surgical
margin (resection margin <1 mm) was reported among the
non-comparative studies. Post-operative morbidity was
reported in 5 out of 6 studies and involved 6 patients (16%).
No post-operative deaths were recorded.
Comparative studies reporting outcome of RLLR vs. ROLR.
One prospective and 4 retrospective studies were identified,
which compared outcomes from patients who underwent
RLLR or ROLR for rHCC (Table I). A total of 267 patients
were included. Among them, 125 patients underwent RLLR
while the remaining 142 patients underwent ROLR. No
significant differences in terms of baseline patient
characteristics, including tumor size were reported by the total
of the studies. Furthermore, they all demonstrated a
significantly lower blood loss rate in favor of RLLR, which
resulted in decreased blood transfusion requirements and
improved operative outcomes (Table II) (27, 28, 30).
Operative time was significantly lower in one study (19) in
favor of the laparoscopic approach with the rest of the studies
demonstrating non-significant differences. Length of stay was
significantly shorter, in 4 out of 5 studies, in the RLLR group
(26-28, 30). Postoperative morbidity was evaluated in 4
studies (26-28, 30) with 3 of them presenting a significantly
decreased morbidity rate in the RLLR group when compared
to ROLR. One study additionally demonstrated significantly
reduced postoperative pain, earlier return of bowel function
and patient mobilization (19). Overall one case of
postoperative mortality was reported in a RLLR patient (28).
Long-term outcomes of patients were reported in 3 studies,
where disease free survival (DFS) at 1, 3 and 5 years were not
found to be different among the 2 groups (19, 26, 30).
Discussion
The advantages of the laparoscopic approach in the treatment
of HCC have been documented in several studies (4-9).
Despite the fact that innovations in this field of surgery have
come in leaps and bounds during the last decade, many centers
worldwide shy away from performing RLLR. In a recently
published international survey, the difficulty of LLR was
increased by the patients’ history of previous liver resection
according to 99% of the survey responders (31). Nonetheless,
a substantial number of studies reporting outcomes from small
numbers of patients have shown that RLLR is a safe and
beneficial alternative to ROLR in the treatment of selected
patients with rHCC eligible for resection.

The presence of adhesions from previous abdominal
surgery constitutes a main concern and an important
limitation for the performance of repeat laparoscopic surgery.
Collective data from our analysis showed that severe
adhesions (grade 3 and 4) were present in approximately a
third of cases (27/90 cases) as reported in 6 studies.
Furthermore, the rate of conversion to ROLR was as low as
4% which is equivalent to conversion rates reported
elsewhere in literature for LLR undertaken for newly
diagnosed HCC in virgin abdomens (32, 33), suggesting that
LLRs although technically complex, are not as cumbersome
to patients and surgeons as was initially thought.
One has to take into account, however, that this low
cumulative conversion percentage in the present review is
derived from retrospective studies with a small number of
patients, in centers with substantial experience in
laparoscopic liver surgery. This is better reflected on the fact
that the median reported blood loss in our data ranged from
75ml to 283ml, whereas, published worldwide literature on
laparoscopic resections for primary liver malignancies report
blood loss of 322ml to 619ml, depending on the extent of the
procedure performed (32, 34). Such amount is considerably
higher than the one in our review despite the need for
adhesiolysis in all cases presented in our analysis.
Nonetheless, this result may be attributed to the fact that the
vast majority of RLLRs were minor and that complete liver
mobilization could have been avoided in many cases. Blood
loss during RLLR was found to be significantly lower
compared to ROLR in all 5 comparative studies included in
our analysis, a result that can further be associated with a
reduced need for blood transfusions (27, 30) and therefore
better short- and long-term outcomes (35, 36). Regarding the
mean operative time, 4 out of 5 comparative studies did not
demonstrate a significantly different operative time, while
one prospective study (19) showed a significantly lower
operative time for the RLLR. This result, however, should

be interpreted with caution considering the small sample size
and the extensive experience of the reporting centers on
laparoscopic hepatectomies.
The oncologic outcome of RLLR in the published studies
was adequate, with no positive resection margins, as reported
in 6 out of 11 studies. When comparing RLLR and ROLR,
morbidity rates were comparable in 2 studies, whereas 2
studies exhibited lower morbidity in the laparoscopic arm
(27, 30). The length of stay was significantly lower in 4 out
of 5 comparative studies; the above results are on par with

the current consensus that laparoscopic surgery results in an
earlier return to normal function. Such effect was not
negatively affected by the theoretical disadvantage of
extensive adhesiolysis as expected in the setting of previous
upper right quadrant interventions. Moreover, these
outcomes can be effectively translated into reduced
hospitalization costs (37).
A critical issue that needs to be addressed is the partly
insufficient data on both the exact approach employed and
the extent of the primary resection in the initial primary HCC
resection, among the included studies. Overall, 6 non￾comparative studies report on the initial surgical approach,
thus there is no comparison between patients who underwent
open versus laparoscopic surgery as an initial approach.
Moreover, as far as the comparative studies are concerned,
only Zhang et al. (19) and Ome et al. (28) specified the exact
initial approach of the primary resection. In the study by
Zhang et al. (19) all patients underwent OLR for the initial
HCC and therefore the comparison between the RLLR and
ROLR is rational. On the other hand, in the study by Chan
et al. (26) the initial approach is described for the RLLR
group (11 patients; 6 primary OLR and 5 primary LLR), yet
the primary resection approach for the ROLR group is not
described. Similarly, with regards to the extent of primary
resection only 2 comparative studies provide adequate data
(26, 27). The lack of this specific information causes great
heterogeneity between the groups and suggests a major
limitation of our study and is a critical reason why a relevant
meta-analysis cannot be performed. Another important
limitation of the included studies is that long-term
comparative outcomes are sparsely reported. One-year DFS
percentages were reported in only two studies (19, 30) with
results being comparable between the laparoscopic and open
groups. The same can be demonstrated for 3-year overall and
disease-free survivals (Table II).
Conclusion
In conclusion, the above results demonstrate that RLLR is a
safe and promising approach in the treatment of rHCC in
selected patients. Contrary to the popular belief that adhesion
formation from previous upper right quadrant surgery might
significantly impact negatively perioperative and oncological
outcomes, the current study shows no such outcome.
Nonetheless such result must be interpreted with caution as
one could hypothesize that the included patients are only
highly selected with preoperatively deemed easily resectable
lesions with/or good underlying liver quality. Regardless, a
number of patients with rHCC eligible to undergo re￾resection operated through the laparoscopic approach benefit
significantly in terms of short-term outcomes akin to patients
who undergo LLR for primary HCC, while the oncologic
adequacy of the procedure is not compromised. Larger and
better-designed prospective trials should be actively pursued
to further elucidate the impact of RLLR on long-term
outcomes and thus establish treatment guidelines.
