CD11c+ B cells have been reported to be increased in autoimmune diseases, but
they are detected in the blood of healthy individuals as well. We aimed to characterize
CD11c+ B cells from healthy donors by flow cytometry, microarray analysis, and in vitro
functional assays. Here, we report that CD11c+ B cells are a distinct subpopulation of B
cells, enriched in the memory subpopulation even if their phenotype is heterogeneous,
with overexpression of genes involved in B-cell activation and differentiation as well
as in antigen presentation. Upon activation, CD11c+ B cells can differentiate into
antibody-secreting cells, and CD11c could be upregulated in CD11c− B cells by B-cell
receptor activation. Finally, we show that patients with pemphigus, an autoimmune
disease mediated by B cells, have a decreased frequency of CD11c+ B cell after
treatment, relative to baseline. Our findings show that CD11c
+ B cells are mainly memory
B cells prone to differentiate into antibody secreting cells that accumulate with age,
independently of gender.

INTRODUCTION
Integrins are a family of heterodimeric cell adhesion receptors with function in cell migration,
survival, and proliferation (1). CD11c (ITGAX gene) is the integrin αX chain protein,
which combines with the β2 chain (CD18; ITGB2 gene). The CD11c/CD18 complex binds
complement iC3b-coated particles to induce phagocytosis (2), cell adhesion molecules [intercellular
adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, ICAM-2, ICAM-4, and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1] (3, 4),
lipopolysaccharide (5), and collagen and fibrinogen (6, 7). CD11c is abundantly expressed on
monocytes, granulocytes, on tissue macrophages, on a subset of dendritic cells, and at low level on
neutrophil, but can be expressed as well on a subset of B cells, T cells, and NK cells, with expression
level varying from dim to bright (8).
CD11c+ B cells are reported to be increased in autoimmune diseases as rheumatoid arthritis
(RA) (9), Sjogren’s syndrome (10), multiple sclerosis (11), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
(12), or after malarial infection (13). CD11c+ B cells accumulate with age in mice and in women
with RA and are thus known as “age-associated B cells” (ABC) (9). However, CD11c+ B cells
are detected in young healthy donors (HD) as well (14). This broad range of conditions could
reflect their state of activation depending on the disease or age and might explain why cell surface
expression of CD11c+ B cells has been reported to be heterogeneous, corresponding to: CD27+

memory cell (9), double-negative (DN) IgD−CD27− (13),
CD21low (10), and T-bet+ (12, 15) or T-bet−, at least in mice
(16). In addition, we reported previously that following toll￾like receptor 9 (TLR9) and B-cell receptor (BCR) stimulation,
CD11c+ B cells from HD were unable to secrete interleukin
(IL)-10 (14), while IL-10 is one of the highest messenger
RNA (mRNA) expressed found in CD11c+ B cells from SLE
patient (12).
In this study, we compared the phenotype, frequency
depending on HD’s age, gene expression profile, mRNA cytokine
expression, and capacity of CD11c+ vs. CD11c− B cells to
differentiate into plasma cells. Despite the fact that CD11c
expression was detected in all B cell subpopulations, our findings
demonstrate that CD11c+ B cells are enriched in memory
B cells, which explains their strong ability to differentiate
into antibody-secreting cells. Moreover, we show that CD11c
upregulation is controlled by BCR stimulation. We report an
increase in the frequency of CD11c+ B cells from blood in
Pemphigus, an autoantibody-mediated disease targeting the
skin and the mucous membranes, which return to HD’s level
following treatment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Phenotyping of PBMCs
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated
from buffy coats obtained via the French blood bank using
Ficoll–Paque density gradient centrifugation (GE Healthcare)
(authorization number: PLER-UPR/2018/014). In addition,
PBMCs from pemphigus patients from the clinical trial number
NCT00784589 were used. This study was approved by the
Ethics Committee of the North West in France and conducted
according to the Declaration of Helsinki principles. HD age was
20–35 years old, which is the age group that most often donates
large volume of blood in our area, unless specified. Representative
frequency’s examples depicted in Figures 1–7 were obtained
from donors in this age group, which is the group of age with
the lowest frequency of CD11c+ B cells according to Figure 1E.
Phenotype analysis was performed with the cytometer
FortessaTM (Becton Dickinson) using the following markers:
LIVE/DEADR Fixable Blue Dead Cell Stain (Invitrogen), Fc
Receptor Blocking Solution (Human TruStain FcX, Biolegend),
CD19-PE-Cy7 (clone Hib19, eBioscience), CD11c-PE or APC
(clone Bu15, Biolegend), IgA-VioBright-FITC (clone IS11-8E10,
Miltenyi), CD27-BV421 (clone M-T271, Becton Dickinson),
IgD-AF700 (clone IA6-2, Becton Dickinson), CD38-PerCP￾Cy5.5 (clone HIT2, Becton Dickinson), CD24-PE-CF594 (clone
ML5, Becton Dickinson), IgG-BV510 (clone G18-145, Becton
Dickinson), IgM-BV605 (clone G20-127, Becton Dickinson),
CD138-BV711 (clone MI15, Becton Dickinson), CD45-BV785
(clone HI30, Sony), and CD20-APC (clone 2H7, Sony).
To confirm the microarray data, PBMC from five different
HD were labeled with the following antibodies: LIVE/DEADR

eBioscience), and BCMA-APC (polyclonal, R&D). All cytometry
data were analyzed using FlowJo software (TreeStar Inc).
Fluorescence-minus-one controls were used to compensate all
flow cytometry data (17).
Isolation of CD11c+ B Cells
B cells were isolated from PBMC using Dynabeads Untouched
Human B cells kit (Life Technologies) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. More than 90% of the isolated
cells were CD19+. B cells were suspended at 10.106
cells/ml in
cold buffer and further stained with LIVE/DEAD Fixable Aqua
Dead Cell Stain Kit (Life Technologies), Fc Receptor Blocking
Solution (Human TruStain FcX, Biolegend), anti-CD19 Pe-Cy7
(clone HIB19, Biolegend), and anti-CD11c APC (clone BU15,
Biolegend). CD11c+ and CD11c− CD19+ B cells were sorted
using BD FACSAria III 4-Laser (BD Biosciences). The purity of
CD11c+ and CD11c− B cells was checked after each sorting and
was mean 95.3% (±3.4%) and mean 99.3% (±0.4%), respectively
(Figure 2). In total, we have performed 26 cell sorting, from 26
different HD. Owing to the low frequency of CD11c+ B cells
and the cell sorter’s setting to purity (which decreased the yield),
B cells were purified from buffy coat, for which the donors are
predominantly between 20 and 35 years old in our area. On
average, out of 722 ± 301 million PBMC (n = 26), we end up
with 46 ± 30 million purified B cells that were used for sorting.
CD11c+ B cells (80,000–1.4 million) were obtained (mean, 5.9 ×
105 ± 4.3 × 105
cells, n = 26) depending on the donor. Owing
to the low number of CD11chi B cells expected recovery, which
represent, on average, 1.6 ± 1.1% of CD19+ B cells as shown in
Figure 1E (n = 30), CD11chi B cells were included in the sorting
of CD11c+ B cells.
In vitro Culture of B Cells
CD11c+ and CD11c− B cells were cultured at a cell density
of 106
cells/ml in Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine,
100 U/ml penicillin, and 100µg/ml streptomycin (all reagents
from Thermo Fisher Scientific). B cells were left unstimulated or
stimulated with 3µg/ml CpG-B 2006 (InvivoGen), 10µg/ml goat
anti-human immunoglobulin A (IgA) IgG IgM (H + L) (anti￾Ig; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) or 1µg/ml R848 for
48 h at 37◦C with 5% CO2. For plasmocyte differentiation and
antibody production assay, CD11c+ and CD11c− B cells were
cultured at a cell density of 2.105
cells/ml in the above media and

were stimulated with 6µg/ml CpG-B 2006, 50 ng/ml IL-21, and
Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I cells (SAC, 1×; Pansorbin cells,
Calbiochem) for 7 days at 37◦C with 5% CO2, unless otherwise
stated. Quantity of IgM and IgG secreted were measured by
ELISA (READY-SET-GO! Kit, eBioscience). In Figure 5E, PBMC
from 10 HD were cultured in 96-well plate U bottom in full
media in the presence of Brefeldin A for 4 h, at 2 × 106
cells/ml,
without any stimulation. Cells were then stained with Live and
Dead, anti-CD45, anti-CD19, and anti-CD11c, washed, fixed,
and permeabilized, and stained with different cytokine-specific
antibodies that are commercially available. Settings were done
using PMA + ionomycin-stimulated cells and fmo.
RNA Preparation
Total RNAs from CD11c+ or CD11c− B cells of 15 HD [5
donors for transcriptome analysis and 10 donors for quantitative
PCR (qPCR)] were extracted with RNeasy Mini kit according
to the manufacturer’s recommendations (Qiagen). The quality
and quantity of isolated mRNAs were assessed using the 2100
Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) and the Nanodrop device
(Thermo Scientific). All RNA samples had an RNA integrity
number of ≥8.2 ± 0.4.
Microarrays
Whole human genomic DNA microarrays were used to perform
one-colored gene expression profiling (4 × 44K Whole Human
Genome, Agilent Technologies). One hundred nanogram for
each CD11c+ or CD11c− B cells sample from 5 HD were labeled
by Cyanine-3 according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Low Input QuickAmp Labeling Kit, Agilent Technologies).
Hybridization was performed at 65◦C for 17 h using a
hybridization kit (Agilent Technologies). After wash steps,
microarrays were scanned with a 5-µM pixel size using the
DNA Microarray Scanner GB (Agilent Technologies). Image
analysis and extraction of raw data were performed with
Feature Extraction Software 10.5.1.1 (Agilent Technologies).

FIGURE 2 | Sorting strategy of CD11c+ and CD11c− B cells. Purified B cells by negative selection using magnetic beads were stained with LIVE/DEAD Fixable Aqua
Dead Cell Stain Kit, Fc Receptor Blocking Solution, and anti-CD19 and anti-CD11c antibodies. CD11c+, including CD11chi and CD11c− CD19+ B cells, were sorted
using FACSAria III. Purity of CD11c+ and CD11c− B cells was checked after each sorting and was mean 95.3% (±3.4%) and mean 99.3% (±0.4%), respectively.
Twenty-six different HD were sorted with age between 20 and 35 years old.
Data were normalized using 75 percentile shift and baseline
transformed by median of all samples. Only spots that passed
these quality controls on 100% of arrays in at least one of
two conditions (CD11c+ or CD11c−) were selected for further
analysis. Hierarchical clustering was performed with Pearson
coefficient metric and Wards linkage to build the transcripts and
sample dendrograms. Data were in agreement with the guidelines
for Minimum Information About a Microarray Experiment
and were deposited in the database of the National Center
for Biotechnology Information’s Gene Expression Omnibus
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). Data are accessible using
the following accession number: GSE112515. Non-uniform and
saturated spots or spots with intensities below the background
were not taken into account.
Functional Analysis of Microarrays
Data from transcriptomic analysis were analyzed with
GeneSpring GX V.13.0 (Agilent Technologies). Paired Student’s
t test (p < 0.05) with Benjamini–Hochberg correction to check
the false discovery rate was used to determine the statistical
significance in gene expression levels between CD11c+ and
CD11c− B cells. The Gene Ontology (GO) analysis was used
to investigate the biological processes, molecular function, or
cellular localization enriched in the transcripts list showing
a significant fluctuation in gene expression between CD11c+
and CD11c− B cells. p value was computed by standard
hypergeometric distribution. The GeneSpring Single Experiment
Analysis bioinformatics tool was used for computational analysis
to identify potential curated canonical pathways with setting

Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain
Reaction
Three nanograms of each RNA sample were retro-transcribed
and preamplified in a 96-well plate containing 0.2 µl Platinum
Taq polymerase and SuperScript III reverse transcriptase
(Invitrogen), a mixture of Taqman primer probes specific for the
transcripts of interest (18), and 5 µl CellsDirect quantitative real￾time PCR buffer (Invitrogen). After centrifugation, samples were
incubated at 50◦C for 15 min for reverse transcription, followed
by 20 cycles of 95◦C, 15 s and 60◦C, 4 min for amplification.
Subsequent preamplified complementary DNA (cDNA) was
stored at −20◦C until analysis. After one-fourth dilution in Tris–
EDTA buffer, each cDNA sample was then separated into 48
separate reactions for further qPCR using the BioMark 48.48
dynamic array nanofluidic chip (Fluidigm, Inc.) as described
in (19). Wells with no RNA were used as negative controls.
Data were analyzed using Real-Time PCR Analysis software with
normalization of the Ct value for each gene using the mean
of five housekeeping genes (GAPDH, β2-M, TUBB, GUSB, and
HPRT1) as calibrator, using geNorm (20). We considered that
gene was expressed if Ct value was <40, and expression curve
was a sigmoid. To compare expression level between samples, a
standard curve was first created with a pool of cDNA from all
samples. From this pool, serial dilutions were performed, and
qPCR values were assigned arbitrary values (6 points ranging
from 100 to 0.4). The gene expression level of samples was
obtained using this standard curve.
Statistical Analyses
All experiments were performed using at least three different
cell cultures or blood donors in independent experiments.
GraphPad Prism 7 was used to create the figures. Student’s t
test and the Wilcoxon paired t test were used to assess normally
distributed data and non-normally distributed data, respectively.
One-way ANOVA with correction by Bonferroni’s posttest, two￾way ANOVA with correction by Sidak’s posttest, and one￾way ANOVA with Dunnett’s posttest were used. p < 0.05 was
considered significant.

for CD11c+ vs. 24 ± 2% for CD11c−, p < 0.0001), as in
the unswitched memory population (CD27+IgD+: 16 ± 1 vs.
6 ± 1%, p < 0.0001) (Figures 1B,C). In addition, CD11c+ B
cells had a significantly higher proportion of IgG+ and IgA+
(IgG+, 24 ± 1 vs. 9 ± 1%, p < 0.0001; IgA+, 20 ± 1 vs. 8
± 1%, p < 0.0001). CD11c+ B-cell frequency was reduced in
the naive (CD27−IgD+, 12 ± 1 vs. 48 ± 2%, p < 0.0001) and
in the DN population (CD27−IgD−, 10 ± 1 vs. 22 ± 2%, p
< 0.0001). No significant difference in frequency was observed
between CD11c+ vs. CD11c− in plasmablast (CD38++CD24−:
0.3 ± 0.1 vs. 0.5 ± 0.1%) nor in transitional B cell population
(CD24hiCD38hi, 2.3 ± 0.4 vs. 1.1 ± 0.2%; p = NS). Second,
CD11c+ B cells were compared to CD11chi B cells. Interestingly,
the CD11chi population was enriched in the naive (24 ± 3%, p <
0.0001) and the unswitched memory population (30 ± 2%, p <
0.0001), and decreased in the switched memory population (38 ±
3%, p < 0.0001) (Figures 1B,C), suggesting a retrograde control
of CD11c expression during B-cell ontogeny and differentiation.
No significant difference was observed between CD11chi and
CD11c+ frequencies in the transitional, DN, and plasmablast
populations (respectively for CD11chi: 1.5 ± 0.3, 8.4 ± 1.5,
and 0.6 ± 0.2%). However, CD11chi B cells had a significantly
higher proportion of IgG+ (IgG+, 32 ± 2.9%, p < 0.01). Of
note, CD11chi B cells had a higher proportion of larger cells
than CD11c+ and the CD11c− B cells (Figure 1D), suggesting a
different stage of differentiation or activation (forward scatter-A
geometric mean fluorescence intensity = 111.57, 104.31, 95 ×
103
for CD11chi, CD11c+, and CD11c− B cells, respectively. p
< 0.0001, n = 30).
Since CD11c+CD27+ B cells have been described to
accumulate in aged women with RA (9), we assessed CD11c+
B-cell frequency depending on age and gender. Figure 1E shows
that CD11c+ B-cell frequency increased with age from 7 ± 1%
in HD aged 20–35 years, up to 35 ± 5% in HD aged 50–70 years
(p < 0.0001), with no difference depending on gender. However,
no difference was observed for CD11chi B-cell frequency between
age groups.
Overall, CD11c was expressed in all B cell subpopulations,
suggesting a role in all B-cell development steps, with an
increased frequency in antigen-driven B cells, which accumulate
with age of HD, independently of gender.
Gene Expression Profile
To better define the cellular characteristics of circulating CD11c+
B cells, we then performed a microarray analysis of CD11c+ vs.
CD11c− B cells from five HD’s blood. After negative selection
using magnetic bead, purified B cells from buffy coat were sorted
based on CD11c expression using BD FACSAria III. Purity of
CD11c+ and CD11c− B cells was checked after each sorting and
was 95.3% (±3.4%) and 99.3% (±0.4%), respectively (Figure 2).
To identify the differentially expressed genes (DEG)
between paired CD11c+ and CD11c− B cells, total RNA were

hybridized on whole human genome microarrays by one-color
technology and analyzed with GeneSpring GX V.13.0 (Agilent
Technologies). Out of 19,905 transcripts that passed the quality
filters after exclusion of spikes and flagged probes, a fold
change cut-off of 2 between CD11c+ and CD11c− samples
identified 1,894 transcripts. To highlight the most discriminant
transcripts, we applied a fold change cut-off of 3. After paired t
test with Benjamini–Hochberg correction for multiple testing
(p < 0.05), removal of duplicate probes, pseudogenes, and
uncharacterized loci, 307 DEG were found to be upregulated and
205 downregulated in CD11c+ compared with CD11c− B cells
(Supplemental Table 1).
GO analysis was performed with the 512 DEG and
identified 145 biological processes, which mainly corresponded
to regulation of cell activation (GO:0050865; p = 7.44 × 10−12),
regulation of multicellular organismal process (GO:0051239;
p = 5.41 × 10−11), regulation of immune system process
(GO:0002682; p = 1.83 × 10−9
), regulation of cell adhesion
(GO:0030155; p = 1.49 × 10−8
), and response to stimulus
(GO:0050896; p = 2.25 × 10−9
). To find molecular functions
enriched in these DEG set, Wiki and Kyoto Encyclopedia of
Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed
using the Single Experiment Analysis tool from GeneSpring
software and DAVID Bioinformatics Resources (21). Pathways
related to TLR signaling (WP1449-45049, p = 4.2 × 10−4
;
WP75-46210, p = 0.001; KEGG 04620, p = 0.029), inflammatory
response (WP453-41201, p = 1.02 × 10−5
), cell adhesion
molecules (KEGG 04514, p = 0.021), FoxO signaling pathway
(KEGG 04068, p = 0.034), and cytokine signaling pathway
(KEGG 04060, p = 0.04) were listed. These findings indicate that
CD11c+ B cells have a clear distinctive gene expression profile
related to active immune response.
Differential Expression of CD1c, CD58,
CD68, CD84, CD86, CD27, CD274, Fas, and
CD200 on Human CD11c+ B Cells
Out of 512 DEG, we selected 12 transcripts coding for cell surface
receptors. CD6 and CD200 were underexpressed, and CD11c
(ITGAX), CD1c, CD84, CD68, CD27, Fas (CD95), CD80, CD58,
CD274, and CD86 were overexpressed in CD11c+ B cells vs.
CD11c− B cells. Principal component analysis (Figure 3A) and
hierarchical clustering (Figure 3B) performed with this minimal
combination of 12 transcripts were sufficient to accurately
discriminate CD11c+ from CD11c− B cells.
We then evaluated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) if these 11 markers (excepting CD11c) could discriminate
CD11c+ from CD11c− B cells as suggested by the microarray
data. We found that CD11c+ B cells overexpressed CD86, CD58,
CD95, CD27, CD68, CD84, and CD1c in comparison with
CD11c− B cells (Figure 3C), even if the expression level for these
markers was heterogeneous, which might suggest a specific level
of expression by the different CD11c+ B cell subpopulations.
On the other hand, CD200 expression was lower in a fraction
of CD11c+ B cells compared with CD11c− B cells (Figure 3D).
No difference was observed for the CD274, CD80, and CD6
markers, which were weakly expressed by B cells (Figures 3C,D).
Overall, the differences in the mRNA expression level between
CD11c+ and CD11c− B cells were confirmed at the protein
level for 8 out of 11 markers, although the expression of
these markers was not strictly associated with the CD11c+ B
cell population. However, text mining from bibliographic data
performed with natural language processing algorithm showed
that 9 out of 12 cell surface receptors (CD11c, CD1c, CD27,
CD58, CD68, CD80, CD86, CD95, and CD274) were related
and constituted a functional network associated with CD11c
(Figure 4).
Cytokine Gene Expression of CD11c+ B
Cells
To characterize the cytokines expressed by CD11c+ and CD11c−
B cells, we analyzed the expression of 25 cytokines known to
be secreted by B cells, in addition to 5 housekeeping genes and
1 transcription factor (19), using Biomark HD real-time PCR.
Sorted B cells from 10 HD were analyzed. EBI3, IL7, IL1β,
IL12p40, IFNγ , Baff, and IL10 were found to be significantly
upregulated, while IL6, IL15, IL23p19, and BCMA were found
significantly downregulated in ex vivo purified CD11c+ B
cells (Figures 5A,B). qPCR analyses confirmed the significantly
different expression of EBI3 and IL6 observed using microarray,
with a fold change > 3 (Supplemental Table 1) and that of IL7,
IL15, and IL23p19 with a fold change > 2 (data not shown). No
significant difference in expression of the genes, April, TNFα,
IL1RA, IL12p35, TNFβ, Trail, TGFβ2, CD19, Taci, and BAFF￾R, was observed between CD11c+ and CD11c− B cells (data
not shown). IL2, IL5, IL9, IL13, IL17A, IL17F, IL27p28, and
IL21 mRNAs were not detected by qPCR. To confirm cytokine
preferential expression at the protein level, PBMC from 10 HD
were cultured in the presence of Brefeldin A for 4 h, without any
stimulation, and then stained intracellularly with commercially
available antibodies specific for: EBI3, IL-1β, IFN-γ, IL-10, IL-6,
and BCMA. We confirmed a significant preferential expression
for EBI3, IL-1β, IFN-γ, and IL-10 at the protein level for CD11c+
B cells (n = 10) and a tendency for a lower expression of
BCMA, even if the percentage of stained cells was very low
(Figure 5E). However, we observed a higher percentage of IL￾6
+ cells among CD11c+ B cells than CD11c− B cells, which
is the opposite of what we observed at the RNA level. This
discrepancy could be due to the instability of IL6 mRNA (22)
or by a regulatory IL-1β feedback loop as IL-6 is induced by
IL1-β (23).
We confirmed that CD27 was significantly upregulated in
CD11c+ B cells, as well as CD11b and CD11c (Figure 5C).
The transcription factor IRF5 was also significantly
upregulated in CD11c+ B cells (Figure 5D), which was
confirmed by microarray data with a fold change > 2
(data not show).
In short, cytokine genes overexpressed in CD11c+ B cells
corresponded to both pro-inflammatory (IFN-γ, EBI3, IL￾1β, IL-12p40) and anti-inflammatory (EBI3, IL-10) cytokines,
and cytokines involved in B-cell survival (IL-7, Baff, IL-10),
activation, and differentiation (IL-1β, IFN-γ) as well as in isotype
switch (EBI3, IFN-γ, and IL-10) (24–26).

Differentiation of CD11c+ B Cells Into
Plasma Cells
Since CD11c+ B cells were enriched in the memory
subpopulation and upregulated IRF5, which is involved in
the differentiation into plasma cells (27, 28), we assessed the
ability of CD11c+ B cells to differentiate into antibody-secreting
cells. CD11c+ and CD11c− were cultured without or with
stimulation (CPG + SAC + IL-21) for 7 days. Plasmablast
and plasmocyte differentiation was evaluated by FACS using
CD27+CD38+CD138− and CD27+CD38+CD138+ expression,
respectively (Figure 6A) (27). A higher proportion of CD11c+
than CD11c− B cells was able to differentiate into plasmablasts
(31 ± 10 vs. 7 ± 3%; n = 6, p < 0.05) and plasmocytes (8 ± 3
vs. 1 ± 0.2%; p < 0.04) (Figure 6B). Interestingly, the number
of CD11c− B cells upregulating the plasmocyte-specific marker
CD138 did not increase, even after a longer stimulation time of 9
days (data not shown). On the opposite, for a shorter stimulation
time of 5 days, 29% (±17.1%) CD11c+ B cells differentiate into
plasmablasts vs. 6.3% (±2.4%) for CD11c− B cells, and 3.1%
(±2.7%) CD11c+ B cells differentiate into plasmocytes vs. 0%
(±0%) for CD11c− B cells (n = 3; p > 0.3, data not shown).
We then measured the IgM and IgG secretion using ELISA.
After 7 days of stimulation, CD11c+ B cells secreted 1.3-
fold more IgM and 2.8-fold more IgG than CD11c− B cells
(Figure 6C) (for IgM from CD11c+ B cells, 25 ± 6 ng/ml, and
for CD11c− B cells, 19 ± 10 ng/ml, n = 7, p = 0.011; for
IgG from CD11c+ B cells, 1.7 ± 0.3 ng/ml, and for CD11c− B
cells, 0.6 ± 0.3 ng/ml; n = 7, p = 0.0002). A 2.7-fold higher
secretion of IgM and 1.4-fold higher secretion of IgG by CD11c
+
B cells than CD11c− B cells was also observed after a shorter
stimulation duration of 5 days (IgM, 27.1 ± 10.3 vs. 10 ±
5.8 ng/ml; p = 0.014; IgG, 1.4 ± 0.3 vs. 1 ± 0.5 ng/ml; p =
0.0093). Without stimulation, neither CD11c+ nor CD11c− B
cells upregulated CD138 (data not shown) nor produced IgM
or significant quantity of IgG (Figure 6C). Therefore, upon
stimulation, CD11c+ B cells were found prone to differentiate
into antibody-secreting cells, especially plasmocytes, with a
higher frequency of immunoglobulin class switched, which is
probably due to the higher frequency of memory B cells in the
CD11c+ B cells subpopulation.
Upregulation of CD11c Upon BCR
Stimulation
We next addressed whether CD11c− B cells could upregulate
CD11c upon activation. Purified CD11c− B cells were cultured
without stimulation or with different stimuli: CpG (TLR9
agonist), anti-Ig, R848 (TLR7/8 agonist) for 48 h. CD11c
expression was measured by qPCR and flow cytometry. TLR9
or TLR7 stimulation did not upregulate CD11c, while BCR
stimulation upregulated CD11c at the protein and mRNA levels
(Figure 7), demonstrating that CD11c upregulation is controlled
by BCR stimulation. Interestingly, the combine stimulation
TLR + anti-Ig inhibit CD11c upregulation induced by BCR
stimulation alone, at the protein and mRNA level for TLR9,
while only at the protein level for TLR7. Therefore, CD11c
upregulation is controlled by BCR stimulation but can be
counteracted by TLR7 or TLR9 costimulation.
Higher Frequency of CD11c+ B Cells in
Pemphigus Patients Before Treatment
CD11c+ B cells have been associated with autoimmune diseases
(9–12). Pemphigus is an autoimmune disease affecting skin and
mucous membranes, with pathogenic autoantibodies directed
against desmogleins 1 and 3 (Dsg1 and Dsg3). We therefore
evaluated the frequency of CD11c+ B cells in patients with active
pemphigus vulgaris (PV) in comparison to HD. Patients with
active PV have not a significant higher frequency of CD11c+ B
cells (p > 0.05) than HDs (Figure 8A). However, patients’ age
ranges from 19 to 79 years old, and Figure 1E shows a significant
difference in CD11c+ B cells between age groups. We therefore
compared CD11c+ B cells per age groups and found that patients
with active PV have a significant higher frequency of CD11c+ B
cells than HD in age groups 20–35 and 50–70, but not for the
age group 35–50 (Figure 8B). We recently showed that first-line
Rituximab treatment allowed achieving an 89% rate of complete
remission off therapy at month 24 in pemphigus patients (29).
Patients were then evaluated at month 36 when B cells were
detectable in blood. PV patients who relapsed have a significant
higher frequency of CD11c+ B cells than patients in complete
remission at month 36 (Figure 8C). Interestingly, the frequency
of CD11c+ B cells was 1.6 times higher in the relapse groups
at month 36 when compare to baseline at day 0 (mean, 25 ±
6% at day 0 vs. 40 ± 6% at month 36, n = 5), while in the
group of PV patients with no relapse, the frequency of CD11c+ B
decreased at month 36 when compare to baseline at day 0 (mean,
22 ± 5% at day 0 vs. 16 ± 4% at month 36, n = 9). Therefore,
CD11c+ B-cell frequency increases during active disease in PV
patients but decreases after healing. We did not observed a
correlation between the percentage of CD11c+ B cells and the
autoantibodies, anti-Dsg1 and anti-Dsg3 titer (Figure 8D).
DISCUSSION
An unusual B-cell subset characterized by CD11c expression
has been described to be enriched in patients with different
autoimmune diseases as RA (9), Sjogren’s syndrome (10),
multiple sclerosis (11), and SLE (12), as well as during infections
or in aged individual (9, 13). However, these B cells can be found
in HD as well. This broad range of condition could explain
why markers used to characterize this population are diverse.
Indeed, a B cell population that expressed Fc receptor-like 4 and
CD11c was described in tissue and tonsil of HD, as memory
B cells but CD27− (30). Later, Huifang Li described these
so called tissue-like-memory B cells in HD blood as FcRL5+,
CD21low, CD27−, and CD11c+ B cells (15). In our study, we
focus our analysis on CD19+CD11c+ B cells, which include
subpopulation expressing FcRL5 or CD21low or CD27− CD11c+
B cells, already described. Immunophenotyping, molecular, and
functional analyses demonstrated in a consistent manner that
CD11c+ B cells correspond to a subset of B cells, which mainly

but not exclusively belong to memory B cells, and have a strong
ability to differentiate into antibody-secreting cells.
We first confirmed that the percentage of CD11c+ B cells
increased with age in HD (Figure 1E), as reported in mice
in which CD11c+ B cells accumulate and are known as ABC
(9). Despite the fact that CD11c+ B cells have been reported
to be increased in women with RA, we did not evidence any
relationship with gender in HD. No significant differences were
observed between age groups for CD11chi B cells.
Phenotypic analyses showed that the CD11c+ B
subpopulation was significantly enriched in switched and
unswitched memory B cells, while CD11c− B cells were
principally naive or DN B cells (Figure 1C), thus confirming
Rubtsov’s but not Wang’s data (9, 12). However, by following
Wang’s gating strategy on CD19hiCD11chi cells, we observed
a significant decrease in switched memory and a significant
increase in unswitched memory and naive B cells in comparison
with CD11c+ B cells. However, the DN B cells were not increased
as Wang reported (12). The facts that [1] frequencies of CD11chi
B cells did not change with age while CD11c+ B cells increase
with age, [2] CD11chi B cells have a bigger size, and [3] are
enriched in the unswitched memory phenotype in comparison
with CD11c+ B cells strongly suggest that CD11chi and CD11c+
B cells are two distinct populations.
DN cells (CD27−IgD−) are atypical memory cells, which
are reported to be exhausted, anergic, or preplasma cells. The
role of DN cells remains unclear, but it has been observed
that DN frequency increases during infection (HIV, malaria,
Hantavirus), autoimmune disease (SLE, multiple sclerosis), as
well as in non-small cell lung cancer (13, 31–35). In addition,
DN cells are reported to express CD11c in HIV, malaria,
Hantavirus infection, SLE, and multiple sclerosis (11, 36, 37).
Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 12 February 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 32

Golinski et al. CD11c+ B-Cells From Human Blood
Based on those observations, one could expect to have a higher
frequency of DN cells among CD19+CD11c+/hi. However, we
analyzed HD blood in Figure 1C, and frequency of DN cells
was lower in CD19+CD11c+/hi than in CD19+CD11c− B
cells. Our interpretation is that DN CD11c+ B cells increase
during ongoing immune response, associated with a strong
inflammatory response. In addition, SC Jenks shows that DN
CD11c+ B cells in SLE are poised to generate plasmablasts
(33), and J. Fraussen shows that DN cells contain less somatic
mutation than switched memory B cells in multiple sclerosis (32).
Therefore, we hypothesize that DN CD11c+ B cells could be an
intermediate step of differentiation toward plasma cells during
B-cell activation, while in normal condition, DN CD11c− B cells
could be anergic or exhausted B cells.
Despite the preferential expression of CD11c among memory
B cells, our phenotypic analyses showed that CD11c was
expressed by all B cell subpopulations that we analyzed. To
identify a unique surface marker and transcription signature, we
performed a microarray analysis on CD11c+ and CD11c− B cells
purified from five HD.
CD11c+ B cells were extremely different from CD11c− B
cells with 512 DEG with a fold change above 3. However,
none of the cell surface markers identified by microarray was
able to strictly discriminate CD11c+ from CD11c− B cells by
FACS because of their heterogeneous expression (Figures 3C,D).
Moreover, CD11c+ B cells are often characterized by low or
negative expression of CD21 (9, 11). However, gene expression
of CD21 was found downregulated in CD11c+ B cells with
a fold change < 3, and CD21 expression analyzed by FACS
revealed that less than 10% of CD19+CD11c+ were CD21low/−
in HD (data not shown). Similarly, IL-21R was reported to be
upregulated in SLE patients (12). However, in our study, IL21R
and IL21 are not a DEG, and IL21 was not detected by qPCR,
which suggests that these markers are specific of CD11c+ B cells
in SLE.
Wikipathways and GO analyses identified, in CD11c+ B cells,
an enrichment of cell activation and cell adhesion molecules, TLR
signaling, and inflammatory response. Indeed, upregulation of
genes coding for the CD80 and CD86 costimulatory molecules
observed in CD11c+ B cells was confirmed by FACS for CD86
(Figure 3C). This result is in accordance with studies showing
the overexpression of costimulatory molecules in ABCs (9, 11,
12). Interestingly, CD200 was downregulated in CD11c+ B cells
(Figure 3D), which can inhibit monocyte stimulation through
binding to CD200-R (38), while the upregulation of CD58 lead
to increased adhesion and activation of T cells through binding
to CD2 (39).
TLR7 signaling is crucial for CD11c+ B-cell development in
mice (40). In addition, TLR9 has been shown to be upregulated
in CD11c+ B cells from SLE patients (12). Here, we demonstrated
that TLR7 or TLR9 stimulation of purified CD11c− B cells
was not sufficient to upregulate CD11c expression (Figure 7),
whereas BCR stimulation was sufficient. Upregulation of CD11c
was reduced as well by almost 2-fold (36.7% vs. 19.6%) by
adding CpG on B cells stimulated by anti-IgM + anti-CD40
(12). Therefore, while TLR signaling is an important signaling
pathway highlighted by the microarray analysis, TLR signaling
does not seem to be crucial for CD11c upregulation in human
peripheral B cells.
IRF5 is a transcription factor that can induce IFNγ mRNA
transcription (41) and regulate IgG class switching in B cells
(27, 42). Our qPCR analysis showed an overexpression of
IRF5 by CD11c+ B cells (Figure 5D), which is in agreement
with a previous report showing that IRF5 participates in the
development of ABCs in systemic autoimmunity in mice (43).
Activation of TLR7 and TLR9 induces IRF5 translocation in
the nucleus, leading to the transcription of IFN and other
pro-inflammatory cytokine genes (43). Indeed, we observed a
significant increase in IFNγ gene expression as well as IL1β,
IL7, and IL12p40 (Figure 5A). On the other hand, transcriptomic
and qPCR analyses showed that the gene expression of EBI3,
which is a subunit of the cytokine IL-27, was increased in
CD11c+ B cells (Figure 5A) (44). Interestingly, IL-27 and IFN￾γ can induce B-cell intrinsic T-bet expression, which regulates Ig
class switching and is required for the production of long-lived
antibody-secreting cells (25, 45).
As previously described in SLE patients, gene expression
level of IL6 was decreased and IL10 was increased in CD11c+
compared with CD11c− B cells (Figure 5) (12). Although IL￾6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine (46, 47) and IL-10 has anti￾inflammatory effects, both help in B-cell differentiation and
survival as well. Moreover, we previously reported that IL￾10 secretion following TLR9 and BCR stimulation was not
detected by ELISA in CD11c+ B cells from HD (14), suggesting
that IL-10 might be completely consumed by B-activated cells
differentiating into antibody-secreting cells.
Furthermore, we observed an overexpression of TBX21 (T￾bet) in CD11c+ B cells, confirming studies that demonstrated
that ABC express high levels of CD11c and transcription factor T￾bet (48–52). Although the transcription factor T-bet is not usually
expressed by B cells (53, 54), several studies demonstrated its role
in Ig class switching (55, 56). Moreover, Rubtsov et al. showed
that CD11c+ T-bet+ B cells were more effective in presenting Ag
than other B cell subpopulations (57). Consequently, we observed
that, upon stimulation, CD11c+ B cells were found prone to
differentiate into antibody-secreting cells, especially plasmocytes,
with a higher frequency of immunoglobulin class switched than
CD11c− B cells subpopulation (Figure 6). However, not all
CD11c+ B cells are T-bet+ in SLE patients or HD, and some T￾bet+ B cells do not express CD11c (12). Moreover, B-cell-intrinsic
T-bet deletion in a murine lupus model exerted no impact of
CD11c+ B cells generation in vivo (16).
Finally, we observed that the frequency of CD11c+ B cells
was higher in PV patients than HD defined per age groups, as
previously reported in RA. Moreover, the frequency of CD11c+
B cells increased in a group of PV patients with active disease
in comparison with a group in complete remission, 36 months
after treatment (Figure 8C), suggesting that CD11c+ B-cell
frequencies could be an indicator of disease activity. During
active disease, CD11c+ B cells were enriched in the memory
compartment (switched, unswitched, and DN), and we did not
observed a preferential expansion of DN cells (data not shown).
In addition, we did not observed a correlation between the
frequency of CD11c+ B cells in the blood and the autoantibodies

titer as previously reported in SLE (12), which could be due
to the skin localization of B cells in the skin lesions of PV
patients (58).
In conclusion, our study has characterized CD11c+ B
cells in the blood of HD. CD11c is expressed in many
B cell subpopulations but is enriched in memory B cells,
which have a strong ability to differentiate into plasmocytes
and secrete Ig. Accumulation of CD11c+ B cells, which
