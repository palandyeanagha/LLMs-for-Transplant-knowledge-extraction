Abstract
Introduction Treatment options for non-alcoholic fatty 
liver disease (NAFLD) in patients with type 2 diabetes 
(T2D) are still a matter of debate. We compared the effects 
of a diet including different components versus a proven 
beneficial diet rich in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) 
on liver fat in T2D.
Research design and methods According to a parallel 
design, 49 individuals with T2D, overweight/obese, 
with high waist circumference, 35–75 years-old, in 
satisfactory blood glucose control with diet or drugs not 
affecting liver fat content, were randomly assigned to an 
8-week isocaloric intervention with a MUFA diet (n=26) 
or a multifactorial diet rich in fiber, MUFA, n-6 and n-3 
polyunsaturated fatty acids, polyphenols, and vitamins D, 
E, and C (n=23). Before and after the intervention, liver 
fat content was evaluated by proton magnetic resonance 
spectroscopy (1
H-MRS). 1
H-MRS complete data were 
available for n=21 (MUFA diet) and n=18 (multifactorial 
diet) participants.
Results Adherence to dietary interventions was optimal. 
No significant differences between groups in body 
weight reduction, plasma glycated hemoglobin, insulin, 
glucose, lipids and liver enzymes were observed. Liver 
fat significantly decreased after both the multifactorial 
diet (9.18%±7.78%vs 5.22%±4.80%, p=0.003) and the 
MUFA diet (9.47%±8.89%vs 8.07%±8.52%, p=0.027) 
with a statistically significant difference between changes 
either in absolute terms (−4.0%±4.5%vs −1.4%±2.7%, 
p=0.035) or percent (−40%±33%vs −19%±25%, 
p=0.030).
Conclusions An isocaloric multifactorial diet including 
several beneficial dietary components induced a clinically 
relevant reduction of liver fat in patients with T2D, more 
pronounced than that induced by simply replacing 
saturated fat with MUFA. This suggests that the ‘optimal 
diet’ for NAFLD treatment in T2D should be based on 
synergic actions of different dietary components on 
multiple pathophysiological pathways.

Introduction
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) 
is an ominous condition encompassing a 
wide range of histopathological and clin￾ical pictures, from isolated steatosis (hepatic 
triglyceride accumulation with minimal or no 
inflammation) to non-alcoholic steatohepa￾titis (NASH, steatosis with inflammation and 
necrosis), and eventually cirrhosis and/or 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
NAFLD is highly prevalent (57% to 80%) in 
patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), carrying 
Significance of this study
What is already known about this subject?
► While epidemiological evidence suggests that the in￾take of whole grains, legumes, and dietary fiber may 
be protective on liver fat, no intervention trials are 
available. In clinical trials, n-6 polyunsaturated fatty 
acid (PUFA) or monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) 
improved liver fat independently of body weight 
changes, while supplementations with vitamins or 
different polyphenol combinations yielded inconclu￾sive results.
► Only two randomized trials compared the effec￾tiveness of dietary patterns, independently of body 
weight changes, on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease 
(NAFLD) with no univocal results.
What are the new findings?
► Our trial shows for the first time that, in patients with 
type 2 diabetes (T2D), an isocaloric multifactorial 
diet including changes in different dietary compo￾nents (fiber, MUFA, n-6 and n-3 PUFAs, polyphenols, 
and vitamins D, E, and C) is more effective on liv￾er fat than a MUFA-rich diet already proven to be 
effective.
► The effect size of liver fat reduction achieved with 
our multifactorial diet is the highest obtained so far 
with any dietary or pharmacological intervention for 
treating liver steatosis in T2D.
► Our innovative approach—isocaloric and based on 
small variations in the habitual diet—would be more 
feasible in the long term than marked modifications 
in energy or single nutrient intake.

Significance of this study
How might these results change the focus of research or 
clinical practice?
► Our results are clinically relevant, suggesting that the multifactorial 
diet could be currently considered the optimal dietary approach to 
prevent and treat NAFLD in patients with T2D.
► Enlarging alimentary choices as dietary therapeutic options for 
NAFLD in T2D might favor adherence to healthy dietary plans also 
in every-day life and in different social, cultural, and geographical 
contexts.
a higher likelihood of progression to NASH, cirrhosis 
and HCC and a higher mortality for all causes and 
cardiovascular disease. This legitimates NAFLD as a new 
complication of diabetes.1 2 Despite its morbidity burden, 
there are no drugs currently approved for the treatment 
of this condition.2
 Furthermore, concerns relate to the 
efficacy of dietary treatment. Body weight loss has been 
consistently shown to reduce hepatic fat content and to 
improve liver histology.2
 These changes are appreciable 
with a 3%–5%wt loss and increase linearly with further 
loss.3 4 Unfortunately, body weight variations are difficult 
to achieve and maintain. Therefore, lifestyle modifica￾tions able to improve liver health independently of weight 
changes are highly warranted, especially in patients at 
high risk of NAFLD, such as patients with T2D.
There are indications that isocaloric dietary changes 
may influence liver fat content and that the quality 
of macronutrients impacts liver steatosis as much as 
their quantity.5
 In general, replacing total carbohy￾drates with an isoenergetic amount of total fat worsens 
liver steatosis.6–8 However, not all carbohydrates and 
fats behave the same. Substituting saturated fatty acids 
(SFAs) with monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) 
or n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) induced a 
clinically relevant reduction of liver fat in intervention 
trials on different populations.9–11 As for carbohydrate 
quality, epidemiological evidence and intervention trials 
highlight the detrimental effects of simple sugars,12 in 
particular fructose,13 while epidemiological data show a 
protective action of low-glycemic index, fiber-rich foods 
on liver fat accumulation.14 15 Other dietary components, 
such as polyphenols, vitamins C, E and D, and n-3 PUFA, 
are supposed to improve NAFLD because of their antiox￾idant and anti-inflammatory properties, both shown in in 
vitro and in animal studies.16 In addition, trials in people 
at high cardiovascular risk have shown that diets naturally 
rich in polyphenols are able to beneficially affect some 
of the metabolic pathways involved in the pathogenesis 
of NAFLD, such as postprandial lipemia, oxidative stress, 
and glucose metabolism.17 18 However, trials exploring 
the effects on liver steatosis and fibrosis of supplemen￾tation with polyphenols and different vitamins have 
provided non-conclusive results,5
 with no studies specif￾ically evaluating vitamins and polyphenols coming from 
natural foods. Moreover, there is no evidence of the 
effects of combining all the aforementioned dietary 
components. This may be relevant, because the different 
dietary components, either alone or synergistically, could 
act on multiple mechanisms possibly leading to NAFLD, 
such as de novo lipogenesis, fat oxidation, inflammation, 
oxidative stress, and/or gut microbiota changes. Limited 
data from observational studies show a direct association 
between liver steatosis and a Western dietary pattern, and 
an inverse association with the Mediterranean diet adher￾ence score.
19 However, to the best of our knowledge, only 
two randomized trials have compared the effectiveness of 
dietary patterns, including some of the aforementioned 
components, independently of body weight changes, on 
NAFLD, with no univocal results.20 21
With this in mind, we questioned whether an isocaloric 
diet formulated with high contents of several potentially 
beneficial components may be more favorable to liver 
fat content than an isocaloric diet naturally rich only in 
MUFA.
To test this hypothesis, we compared the effects on liver 
fat of an isocaloric multifactorial diet characterized by 
high contents of fiber, MUFA, n-6 and n-3 PUFAs, poly￾phenols, vitamin D, E, and C, with an isocaloric diet rich 
in MUFA, already shown to be effective in reducing liver 
fat in patients with T2D.9
Research design and methods
Participants
Eligible patients at screening were men and postmeno￾pausal women (35–75 years) with T2D, overweight/
obesity (body mass index (BMI) 27–35kg/m2
), high 
waist circumference (men: ≥102cm, women: ≥88cm), 
good metabolic control (glycated hemoglobin A1c
(HbA1c) levels≤7.5% (58.5 mmol/mol), fasting plasma 
low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol≤3.36mmol/L 
and triglyceride≤3.95mmol/L), stable treatment (no 
changes in the previous 6 months) with diet alone or 
diet plus oral glucose-lowering (metformin, repaglinide, 
dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, or sulfony￾lureas), lipid-lowering (statins and ezetimibe) or antihy￾pertensive drugs.
The exclusion criteria were the following: any acute 
or chronic hepatic disease, excluding NAFLD; history 
of alcohol intake exceeding 30g/day in men and 20g/
day in women; any other acute/chronic disease severely 
affecting health status; unstable body weight (±3kg 
changes) in the previous 6 months; current smoking; 
unstable food habits; regular moderate to strenuous 
physical activity; and supplementation with vitamins, 
nutraceuticals, or antioxidants.
Study design
We performed a monocentric, two-arm, open-label, 
randomized, controlled trial in patients with T2D regu￾larly attending the diabetes outpatient clinic of the 
Federico II University Teaching Hospital (Naples, Italy).
This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov.

During a 3-week run-in period, participants were stabi￾lized on a diet reproducing their habitual dietary habits, 
which are within the dietary pattern of patients with T2D 
in Italy22 (protein, 16% of total energy intake (TEI); fat, 
33%; SFA, 12%; MUFA, 16%; PUFA, 5%; carbohydrate, 
51%; sugar, 15%; fiber, 9g/1000 kcal; polyphenols, 
360mg/day). At baseline, before the intervention diet, 
composition was similar in the two dietary intervention 
groups (online supplementary table 1). Participants were 
asked to keep their habitual physical activity unchanged 
during the whole experimental period. Drugs for 
diabetes, hypertension and lipids were not changed 
during the trial.
Then, participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to 
one of the two 8-week dietary interventions, the MUFA 
diet or the multifactorial diet, by a researcher not directly 
involved in the trial using the minimization method with 
MINIM software (www.users.york.ac.uk), stratified for 
sex, BMI (27–29kg/m2
 or 30–35kg/m2
), and glucose￾lowering treatment (diet alone or diet plus metformin, 
or diet plus metformin in combination with the other 
glucose-lowering drugs allowed in the trial).
The experimental diets were isoenergetic—in order 
to keep the body weight constant—and had a similar 
amount of total fat, MUFA and carbohydrates, while 
differing for n-3 and n-6 PUFAs, fiber, glycemic index, 
polyphenols, and vitamins D, E, and C (table 1).
The main foods characterizing the two diets are listed in 
table 2. The multifactorial diet was based on whole grain￾based products, legumes, vegetables, oranges, rocket 
salad, artichokes, onions, decaffeinated coffee, green tea, 
high-polyphenol extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO), almonds, 
and salmon. The MUFA diet was based on refined flour￾based foods, potatoes, low-polyphenol EVOO, daily 
consumption of vegetables and fruits with a low content 
in polyphenols and fiber.
Alcohol intake was not allowed in either group 
throughout the study.
To improve dietary compliance, patients were seen 
every 2 weeks by a skilled dietitian who also made tele￾phone calls every 2–3 days. A weekly dietary plan was 
provided to the participants to ensure that frequency and 
amount of specific foods characterizing the dietary inter￾vention were met. Moreover, some foods were supplied 
to the participants for the whole duration of the study to 
facilitate dietary compliance: EVOO, green peas, frozen 
vegetables (cauliflower and zucchini), tomato sauce, beef 
cured meat (bresaola), decaffeinated coffee for the MUFA 
diet; and polyphenol-rich EVOO, legumes (ie, lentils, 
cannellini beans, chickpeas and green peas), whole grain 
pasta, frozen vegetables (broccoli, peppers, mushrooms, 
artichokes and endive), frozen salmon, tomato sauce, 
beef cured meat (bresaola), decaffeinated coffee and 
green tea and almonds for the multifactorial diet.

Adherence to the dietary intervention was evaluated by 
a 7-day food record filled in by the participants at 4 and 
8 weeks. In both groups, participants were considered 
compliant if the intake of MUFA was ≥80% of the amount 
assigned. In addition, participants allocated to the multi￾factorial diet were considered compliant with the dietary 
intervention if polyphenols and fiber intakes were ≥80% 
of the amounts assigned, while participants allocated to 
the MUFA diet were considered compliant if polyphenols 
and fiber intake were not ≥20% of the amounts assigned.
For all other dietary components, participants were 
considered compliant if for each component the intake 
was between ±20% of assigned intakes. Moreover, partici￾pants with a weight loss of >5% were excluded.
Experimental procedures
All measurements were taken after 12hours of overnight 
fast at baseline and after 8 weeks of dietary intervention. 
Anthropometric measurements (weight, height, and 
waist circumference) were taken according to standard￾ized procedures.23 BMI was calculated as weight (in kilo￾gram) divided by the square of height (in meter). Blood 
samples were collected by an antecubital vein, immedi￾ately placed on ice, centrifuged at 4°C, separated, and 
then stored at −80°C until analyses. Radiologists and labo￾ratory staff were masked to the treatment assignment.
Liver fat content
Liver fat content was measured by proton magnetic 
resonance spectroscopy (1
H-MRS), performed on a 3 T 
magnetic resonance scanner (dStream, Philips Health￾care, Eindhoven, Holland) equipped with the dStream 
Torso coil, placed on the chest of the patients, and the 
dStream Posterior coil, allowing for abdominal imaging. 
Multiplanar localizing images covering the whole liver 
were preliminarily acquired to position the spectros￾copy voxel. A single voxel of 20×20×20mm was placed 
in the right lobe, avoiding liver edges, large vessels and 
large bile ducts. The spectroscopy was obtained using a 
point-resolved spectroscopy sequence with the following 
parameters: Echo Time (TE)=35 ms, Repetition Time 
for minutes (TRmin)=3000 ms, 16 signal averages, and 
1024 data points over 2000 Hz spectral width. MRS scan 
was triggered at the end of expiration using a respiratory 
belt to minimize breathing artifacts. Spectral analysis was 
carried out offline using the LCModel software (http://
s-provench-er.com), which fits in vivo metabolite spectra 
using model resonances acquired under comparable 
scanning conditions from multiple compounds in stan￾dard phantom solutions (10.1002/nbm.698).24 Values 
of water peak (signal of water, Sw) and the sum of lipid 
peaks at 1.3, 0.9, and 1.6 ppm (signal of fat, Sf) were 
considered for liver fat quantification. Signal decay was 
corrected for the different T2 and T1 decay of water and 
fat using mean T2 relaxation times of 30 and 52 ms and 
mean T1 relaxation time of 990 and 402 ms for water 
and fat, respectively (10.1002/jmri.25734). Finally, the 
Hepatic Fat Index (HFI) was calculated as HFI (%)=100.
Sf ⁄ (Sf+Sw).
Liver elastography
Shear wave elastography (SWE) was performed using the 
iU22 system (Philips) with a convex broadband probe 
(C5-1).25 The elastography of the system (Shear Wave 
Point Quantification) generates shear waves inside the 
liver using the acoustic force of a focused ultrasonog￾raphy beam. A region of interest (ROI) with a box size 
of 2.0×1.0cm was positioned within the liver parenchyma 
under visual control in two-dimensional B-mode at a 
depth of at least 2cm below the liver capsule in segments 
7 or 8 of the liver. The equipment listed the shear wave 
velocity (m/s) in the ROI, as well as the depth at which 
the measurement was performed. To compute tissue 
stiffness in kilopascal, the shear wave velocity (v) was 
converted into the shear modulus G=τ/γ, in which τ is 
the shear stress and γ is the shear strain based on the rela￾tionship G=ρv
2
, in which ρ is the density of the tissue.
Metabolic parameters
Plasma cholesterol, triglyceride, and glucose concentra￾tions were assayed by enzymatic colorimetric methods 
(Roche Diagnostics, Milan, Italy, and ABX Diagnostics, 
Montpellier, France) on an ABX Pentra 400 (HORIBA 
Medical, Montpellier, France). High-density lipopro￾tein (HDL) cholesterol was isolated from plasma by

the Friedewald formula. Plasma insulin concentrations 
were measured by ELISA (DIA-source ImmunoAssay 
S.A., Nivelles, Belgium) on a Triturus Analyzer (Diag￾nostic Grifols, S.A., Barcelona, Spain). The homeostatic 
model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was 
calculated using the following formula: fasting glucose 
(mmol/L)×fasting insulin (pmol/L)/22.
Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transpep￾tidase (γ-GT) activities were determined by the Vista 
1500 automated System (Siemens Healthcare Diagnos￾tics Inc., Tarrytown, NY, USA). HbA1c was determined 
by the VARIANT II (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) high￾performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was the reduction in percentage of 
liver fat content evaluated by 1
H-MRS in the multifacto￾rial diet compared with the reduction in the MUFA diet 
over 8 weeks.
Secondary outcomes included between the two groups 
differences in 8-week changes in anthropometric and 
metabolic parameters, and liver enzymes. Based on our 
previous study,9
 to detect a 20% difference in liver fat 
content between the two groups with an 80% power at 
5% significance level, assuming a 20% dropout rate, a 
sample size of 23 participants for each group was devised.
Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as means±SD unless otherwise stated. 
Baseline differences between the two groups were 
evaluated by independent sample t-test with correction 
for multiple comparisons. Within-group and before–
after intervention differences were assessed by paired 
sample t-test. The effects of the two dietary interventions 
were tested by two-way repeated measures analysis of vari￾ance (ANOVA). Changes in liver fat content were also 
evaluated as percent changes [(8week values−baseline 
values)/baseline values×100].
Spearman’s correlation was used to determine the 
strength and direction of the relationships between meta￾bolic parameters and liver fat. A two-side p value of <0.05 
was considered significant.
The statistical analysis was performed according to 
standard methods using SPSS software V.25 (SPSS/PC).
Results
Baseline characteristics of participants
Between 4 April 2017 and 14 January 2019, 66 patients 
were screened for eligibility; of these, 49 met the inclu￾sion criteria and were randomly assigned to MUFA diet 
(n=26) or multifactorial diet (n=23) (online supplemen￾tary figure 1). Their main characteristics are shown in 
online supplementary table 2. Six of these patients discon￾tinued treatment (four assigned to MUFA diet and two to 
multifactorial diet). A total of 43 patients completed the 
trial, although for 4 of them (MUFA diet n=1, multifacto￾rial diet n=3), data on 1
H-MRS were not complete. There￾fore, statistical analyses were performed on 39 patients 
(MUFA diet n=21, multifactorial diet n=18).

fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c and use of glucose-lowering 
drugs, statins and antihypertensive drugs (table 3).
According to the predefined compliance criteria, one 
participant was excluded from the MUFA group due to low 
adherence to MUFA (<80% of the amount prescribed), 
and two participants were excluded from the multifacto￾rial group, one for low adherence to MUFA, polyphenol 
and fiber intakes (<80% of the amount prescribed), and 
the other for body weight loss higher than 5% during the 
intervention. Therefore, 20 patients in the MUFA diet 
and 16 in the multifactorial diet were included in the per￾protocol analysis (online supplementary figure 1).
Compliance to dietary intervention
Overall compliance to the dietary intervention was 
optimal. The composition of the diets followed by 
the participants—average of the 7-day food records 
completed at weeks 4 and 8—strictly reflected the compo￾sition of the diets assigned to either group, with expected 
significant differences between groups in the amounts of 
the characterizing components (ie, n-3 and n-6 PUFAs, 
fiber, glycemic index, glycemic load, polyphenols, and 
vitamin E, D, and C) (table 1).
Liver fat content
As for the primary endpoint, liver fat significantly 
decreased after both the multifactorial diet (9.18%±7.78% 
vs 5.22%±4.80%, p=0.003) and the MUFA diet 
(9.47%±8.89% vs 8.07%±8.52%, p=0.027) (figure 1A). 
The liver fat reduction induced by the multifactorial 
diet was consistent in all participants, including the ones 
with hepatic fat content at baseline <5%; conversely, a 
less reproducible beneficial effect was observed with the 
MUFA diet: this was mainly confined to participants with 
a higher liver fat at baseline (figure 1A). The change in 
liver fat (8weeks minus baseline values) was significantly 
higher after the multifactorial diet (−4.0%±4.5%) than 
after the MUFA diet (−1.4%±2.7%), (p=0.035 by two-way 
repeated measures ANOVA). Percent reduction (end 
values−baseline×100/baseline) of hepatic fat was signifi￾cantly greater with the multifactorial diet (−40%±33%) 
than the MUFA diet (−19%±25%) (p=0.030 by ANOVA, 
figure 1B).
Adjusting for body weight reduction did not modify the 
differences in liver fat changes between the two groups. 
Moreover, the change in liver fat after the intervention 
was not influenced by the type of diabetes treatment, 
being not statistically different among patients on (1) 
diet alone, (2) metformin alone, (3) metformin+DPP-4 
inhibitors, and (4) metformin+repaglinide (ANOVA, 
p=0.808 in the MUFA group, p=0.127 in the multifacto￾rial group). Similarly, the change in liver fat did not differ 
in statin users versus non-users (p=0.324 in the MUFA 
group, p=0.833 in the multifactorial group).
Liver elastography
We also assessed liver tissue stiffness by SWE. Tissue stiff￾ness did not change significantly after the multifactorial 
diet (6.4±3.3 vs 5.5±1.2kPa, p=0.292) and the MUFA 
diet (5.4±1.9 vs 5.0±1.3kPa, p=0.258), with no significant 
differences between the two diets (p=0.540).
The presence of fibrosis was categorized based on 
cut‐off levels known to being predictive for advanced 
fibrosis.26 At baseline, all participants had a low fibrosis 
grading (F0–F2 stage, ≤9.54kPa), apart from two partici￾pants in the multifactorial diet and one in the MUFA diet 
showing more advanced fibrosis (F3–F4 stage,>9.54kPa).

In the latter three participants, tissue stiffness improved,

At baseline, SWE measurements positively and signifi￾cantly correlated with liver fat content (r=0.353, p=0.030) 
and markers of liver function AST (r=0.480, p=0.002), 
ALT (r=0.388, p=0.016), and γ-GT (r=0.370, p=0.022). No 
significant correlations were found between changes in 
tissue stiffness and changes in liver fat and markers of 
liver function after the dietary intervention.
Anthropometrics and metabolic parameters
Although the two dietary interventions were isocaloric, 
body weight decreased slightly in both groups during 
the 8-week treatments; however, this minimal reduction 
(−1.2±1.3kg with MUFA diet vs −1.2±2.2kg with multi￾factorial diet, p=0.95) was not significantly different 
between the groups. Waist circumference did not change 
significantly during the intervention in the two groups 
(table 4).
No significant differences in AST, ALT, AST/ALT ratio 
and γ-GT were observed between baseline and end of 
intervention and between groups (table 4).
All participants had ALT levels in the normal range 
(<50IU/L) but two subjects in the MUFA group and two 
in the multifactorial group. Adapting more restrictive 
cut-offs27 to our laboratory upper limits, that is, using 
30IU/L for women and 40IU/L for men, we found that 
six subjects in the MUFA group and three in the multifac￾torial group had ALT levels above the limits.
Fasting plasma glucose, plasma insulin, and HOMA-IR 
did not change significantly at the end of the interven￾tions in either groups. Blood glucose control, as shown by 
HbA1c levels, significantly improved after both the multi￾factorial diet (6.57%±0.50% vs 6.34%±0.60%, p=0.013) 
and the MUFA diet (6.56%±0.60% vs 6.37%±0.67%, 
p=0.024) with no difference between groups (table 4). 
Fasting plasma concentrations of total, LDL, and HDL 
cholesterol and triglyceride did not change significantly 
during the intervention in either groups (table 4).
In the whole population, significant positive correlations 
were found between changes in liver fat and changes in 
γ-GT (r=0.470, p=0.009), fasting plasma glucose (r=0.368, 
p=0.023), and HbA1c (r=0.473, p=0.008) (figure 2).
For all analyses, statistical significances did not differ 
when made for Intetion To Treat (ITT) or per protocol.
Conclusions
In this study, both a diet including different beneficial 
dietary items (multifactorial diet) and a diet high in 
MUFA (MUFA diet) were able to reduce liver fat content 
in patients with T2D, although the impact was signifi￾cantly greater with the multifactorial diet.

The multifactorial diet, independently of body weight 
change, induced a clinically relevant decrease (40%) in 
liver fat content. This lowering effect was consistent in all 
participants.
The effect size of liver fat reduction achieved with our 
multifactorial diet is the highest obtained so far with 
any dietary or pharmacological intervention for treating 
liver steatosis in patients with T2D. In patients without 
diabetes, comparable outcomes were achieved with 
short-term dietary interventions either very low in carbo￾hydrates or based on a substantial weight loss.28 29 Both 
strategies would be very difficult to implement in clinical 
practice in the long term.
Our innovative approach, based on multiple small vari￾ations in the habitual diet, would be more feasible in the 
long term than any single very marked modification in 
energy or nutrient intake. This makes our dietary inter￾vention a plausible therapeutic tool in clinical settings.
In consideration of the multiple changes character￾izing the multifactorial diet, we are unable to identify 
which dietary components may have driven the benefi￾cial effects of this approach. Its efficacy is likely related 
to the synergy of several dietary components targeting 
different pathophysiological mechanisms which may have 
a different relevance in individuals with diverse genetic 
and metabolic backgrounds. However, the most relevant 
changes in food choices induced by our multifactorial 
diet would impact primarily the intakes of polyphenols, 
other antioxidants and fiber; these can influence liver fat 
content through different mechanisms.
Data from human studies suggest that polyphenol 
supplements are able to increase energy expenditure and 
mitochondrial function.30 These pathways are crucial 
in the pathogenesis of liver fat. Moreover, it is possible 
that, when polyphenol intake is increased by the appro￾priate choice of natural foods included in a comprehen￾sive dietary plan, they act synergistically and are able 
to boost MUFA and PUFA actions in promoting beta￾oxidation. Indeed, the ability of these dietary compo￾nents to increase fatty acid oxidation has been proposed 
as the main mechanism through which they may be able 
to improve liver steatosis.31 32 In addition, polyphenols 
would, at the same time, ensure mitochondrial efficiency 
by preserving them from the oxidative stress.
Polyphenols, other antioxidants and fibers included in 
our multifactorial diet could also have influenced liver fat 
through modifications of gut microbiota composition.33
The plausibility of this mechanism is also supported by 
results of a recent mechanistic trial in which dietary modi￾fications induced changes in the gut microbiota composi￾tion significantly related to liver fat reduction.28 The high 
content in MUFA from EVOO, the low glycemic index 
of carbohydrate foods, the fiber and vitamins make the 
multifactorial diet reproduce the eating pattern of people 
living in Southern Italy in the 1950s–1960s. However, it 
also includes an amount of polyphenols resembling the 
healthy Nordic dietary pattern.
So far, to the best of our knowledge, few studies 
have evaluated the synergistic effect of multiple 
dietary changes on liver steatosis. The effects of the

Cretan–Mediterranean dietary pattern were tested in a 
small group of non-diabetic people. This dietary inter￾vention consisted in reducing the carbohydrate intake 
(33%–36%TEI) and increasing the intake of MUFA 
from EVOO (22%–24%TEI) and fiber (≈30g/day). 
The outcome of this dietary intervention was a 39% 
decrease in liver fat compared with a 7% liver fat reduc￾tion achieved with a low-fat diet.20 In contrast, in another 
study performed in obese people with liver steatosis diag￾nosed by1
H-MRS, the Cretan diet induced a 20% reduc￾tion in liver fat, which was similar to that achieved with a 
low-fat diet as that recommended by the American Heart 
Association.21 The different outcomes observed in these 
two studies using similar dietary interventions is probably 
due to the longer follow-up of the study by Properzi et 
al,21 which may have highlighted the potential of the low￾fat diet in the long term.
In the aforementioned trials, the experimental diets 
were compared with control diets with a higher carbohy￾drate and a lower MUFA content. This makes it difficult 
to dissect the effects on liver fat content of carbohydrate 
reduction from those due to the higher MUFA intake.7
In our study, the amounts of fat and carbohydrates 
between the two dietary interventions were perfectly 
balanced. Therefore, the different outcomes on liver fat 
content were only accounted for by changes in the quality 
of fat and carbohydrate-rich foods.
As a secondary endpoint of the study, we evaluated 
changes in liver tissue elasticity measured by elastography, 
a reliable and accurate method for staging liver fibrosis.25
In this study, tissue stiffness positively correlated with liver 
fat content. It is possible that fat droplets in the hepato￾cytes may influence the architectural structure of the liver, 
thus altering tissue elasticity and changing the propaga￾tion time of the shear wave through the liver.34 Moreover, 
steatosis could interfere with liver stiffness through the 
induction of portal hypertension via modulation of nitric 
oxide and endothelin synthesis.35 We did not observe 
significant changes in tissue stiffness after either inter￾vention, the very low prevalence of severe fibrosis in our 
cohorts at baseline giving little chance of observing such 
changes. Anyhow, three participants showed advanced 
fibrosis (F3–F4 stage, >9.54kPa) at baseline that reversed 
after diet, possibly leading to significant clinical benefits. 
However, the lack of biopsies does not allow ruling out 
of the possibility that the regression of steatosis may have 
affected the measurement of liver stiffness independent of 
changes in fibrosis.
Although HbA1c significantly improved after both diets, 
we were unable to detect any difference in fasting plasma 
glucose and in indirect indices of insulin resistance between 
the two dietary interventions. This could be due to the very 
good blood glucose control of our participants, which may 
have blunted any further beneficial effect induced by the 
different diets. Moreover, HOMA-IR remains a poor index 
in patients with diabetes, and we had no direct measure￾ments of insulin sensitivity (ie, glycemic clamp). In any case, 
these results clearly emphasize that the benefits achieved 
on liver fat content with the multifactorial diet were inde￾pendent of metabolic control.
Our study has several strengths and some limitations. 
Possible limitations are related to the characteristics of 
the participants. They were in very good glycometabolic 
control, and about 30% of them were free of liver steatosis 
at baseline according to measurement by 1
H-MRS. There￾fore, our conclusions cannot be extended to individuals 
with more severe disease. On the other hand, the results are 
strengthened by being observed in a population including 
also individuals without frank steatosis. Due to the lack of 
liver biopsies, we were unable to evaluate changes in inflam￾mation and/or hepatocellular damage. More remarkably, 
we widened the range of dietary therapeutic options for 
NAFLD in T2D by a multifactorial approach based on food 
choices derived from different cultural backgrounds. This 
has high clinical relevance since compliance in the long 
term is the main drawback of dietary treatments in clin￾ical settings. A wider range of food choices would facilitate 
the adhesion to healthy dietary plans also in everyday life 
and in different social, cultural and geographical contexts. 
In addition, favoring regional choices and substituting 
food of animal origin with plant-based foodstuffs, that is, 
preserving cultural diversity in eating habits, we found that 
our multifactorial diet would fully comply with the healthy 
diet models recommended to implement sustainable food 
systems.36
In conclusion, a multifactorial diet rich in beneficial 
dietary components, inspired by the Mediterranean diet 
from Southern Italy and including elements of other 
healthy dietary patterns, induced a 40% reduction of 
liver fat in people with T2D. Although studies with longer 
follow-up and tissue-related outcomes, in addition to liver 
fat, are needed, the multifactorial diet could be currently 
considered the diet with the best available evidence for 
preventing and treating NAFLD in patients with T2D.
