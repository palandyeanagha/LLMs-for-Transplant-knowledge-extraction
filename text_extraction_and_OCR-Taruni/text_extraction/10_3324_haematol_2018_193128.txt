There is increasing clinical evidence to suggest a suppressive effect on
hematopoiesis in myelodysplastic syndrome patients with iron
overload. However, how iron overload influences hematopoiesis in
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) remains unknown. Here, the
RUNX1S291fs-transduced bone marrow mononuclear cells were yielded
and transplanted into lethally irradiated recipient mice together with
radioprotective bone marrow cells to generate MDS mice. Eight weeks
post transplantation, the recipient mice received an intraperitoneal injec￾tion of 0.2 mL iron dextran at a concentration of 25 mg/mL once every
other day for a total of 8 times to establish an iron overload model. In the
present study, we show that iron overload impairs the frequency and
colony-forming capacity of normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor
cells, especially in erythroid, in MDS mice, which is due, at least in part,
to growth differentiation factor 11-induced reactive oxygen species, short￾ening survival of MDS mice. Given that we are the first to construct an
iron overload model in MDS mice, we hope this model will be helpful for
further exploring the influence and mechanism of iron overload on MDS.

ABSTRACT
Introduction
Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a heterogeneous group of myeloid malig￾nancy characterized by dysplastic changes in one or more cell lineages, ineffective
hematopoiesis, and high risk of leukemic transformation.1,2 Because of chronic ane￾mia, up to 80% of MDS patients become transfusion dependent.3 Due to repeated
blood transfusion and ineffective hematopoiesis, most MDS patients can eventual￾ly develop iron overload. Excessive iron can deposit in the liver, heart, spleen, pan￾creas, bone marrow (BM) and other tissues, resulting in tissue damage and fibrosis,
and a series of complications which seriously affect the prognosis of MDS
patients.4-6 Therefore, iron overload in MDS patients has received great attention
from clinicians. Here the question is whether and how iron overload impacts the
hematopoietic system in MDS. Indeed, iron-chelation therapy often improves the
prognosis of MDS patients, implicating that iron overload has a suppressive effect
on hematopoiesis in these subjects. However, how iron overload influences
hematopoiesis in MDS still has to be addressed.
RUNX1 (also known as AML1/CBFA2), one of the most common mutation genes
in MDS patients, has an important role in hematopoiesis. RUNX1-S291fs is one
type of RUNX1 mutation. Previous studies have proved that RUNX1-S291fs
mutant can be used to construct an MDS mouse model.7,8 In order to investigate
how iron overload affects hematopoiesis in MDS, we generated a RUNX1-S291fs￾induced MDS mouse model and subsequently administered iron dextran by
intraperitoneal injection to establish an iron overload model in MDS mice.
In this study, we found that iron overload impairs the frequency and function of

normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs),
especially in erythroid cells, which may result from
growth differentiation factor 11(GDF11)-induced reactive
oxygen species (ROS) and shortens survival in MDS mice.
Here we are the first to utilize RUNX1-S291fs-induced
MDS mice to successfully construct an iron overload
model. This can provide the experimental basis for further
exploring the influence and mechanism of iron overload
on MDS.
Methods
Ethical considerations 
Our experiment has been approved by the Ethics Committee of
Tianjin First Central Hospital. All animal experiments were con￾ducted in accordance with a protocol approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the
Institute of Radiation Medicine, Chinese Academy of Medical
Sciences (n. 1204). 
Vector and retrovirus construct
The Empty control vector (pMYs-Empty control-IRES-GFP) and
the RUNX1-S291fs mutant vector (pMYs-RUNX1 S291fs-IRES￾GFP) were kindly provided by Dr Atsushi Iwam (Kumamoto
University, Japan). Production of retrovirus construct has been
described previously.8
Mice and treatment 
C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Vital River (Beijing, China)
at 6-8 weeks of age. The animals were quarantined and allowed
to acclimatize for one week. They were maintained in a room at
22±2°C, with a relative humidity of 50%±10%. The mice were
housed 5 individuals per cage and used at a weight of approxi￾mately 20.0-22.0g. Retroviral construct transduced into bone mar￾row mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) was performed as previously
described.9 Briefly, retrovirus-infected BMMNCs were cultured in
αMEM medium containing 10 ng/mL of human IL-6, 10 ng/mL of
mouse IL-3, and 100 ng/mL of mouse SCF for three days, and then
these cells were intravenously injected into 9Gy lethally irradiated
recipient mice together with radioprotective dose of 1×106 BM
cells to generate MDS mice or control mice. Eight weeks post
transplantation, the recipient mice were administered an intraperi￾toneal injection of 0.2 mL iron dextran at a concentration of 25
mg/mL once every other day for a total of 8 times to establish an
iron overload model. At the same time, normal saline was given to
the control group.
Flow cytometric analysis
Flow cytometry was performed by using the following mono￾clonal mouse antibodies: CD45.2, CD45.1, Gr1, Mac1/CD11b,
Ter119, CD71, B220, CD19, CD3, CD5, CD41, CD117/c-Kit, Sca1
and CD34. All Flow cytometric analysis of the stained cells was
performed with Coulter Altra (Beckman Coulter) equipped with
Cytexpert software (Beckman Coulter).
Western blot analysis
To detect the expression of RUNX1S291fs protein, BM cells and
spleen cells were lysed and blotted as previously described.10
Polyclonal anti-RUNX1 and anti-α-Tubulin antibodies were used
to detect RUNX1S291fs protein and α-Tubulin, respectively.
Diagnosis
The diagnosis was made according to the Bethesda proposals
for classification of MDS in mice.11 
Statistical analysis
Results were analyzed with the GraphPad Prism program
(GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Data obeyed nor￾mal distribution were presented as means±Standard Deviation
(SD) and multiple group comparisons were performed by using
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), whereas data with non￾normal distribution were showed by median and quartiles, and
compared by Kruskal-Wallis test. The survival curves were ana￾lyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method with the log-rank test.
P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results 
Iron overload model can be established in
RUNX1S291fs-induced MDS mice
In order to explore the role of iron overload in MDS, we
first transduced a pMYs-RUNX1S291fs-IRES-GFP or a
pMYs-Empty control-IRES-GFP retroviral construct into
BMMNCs (Figure 1A). After five days culture in vitro, the
transduced cells were transplanted into lethally irradiated
recipient mice together with radioprotective BM cells to
generate MDS mice or control mice (Figure 1A). Eight
weeks after transplantation, the recipient mice were
administered iron dextran or normal saline by intraperi￾toneal injection. Hereafter, we refer to the Empty control
mice with normal saline, the Empty control mice with iron
dextran, the RUNX1S291fs mice with normal saline, and
the RUNX1S291fs mice with iron dextran as Empty/NS,
Empty/FE, RX291/NS and RX291/FE mice, respectively.
The ratio of GFP+ cells gradually increased over 24 weeks
after the transplantation in RX291/NS and RX291/FE
mice, but not in mice who received transplants of the
Empty control-transduced cells (Figure 1B), which indicat￾ed that the RUNX1S291fs-transduced cells successfully
engrafted and established chimerism in the peripheral
blood (PB).
To verify the establishment of an MDS model, several
mice were sacrificed at 24 weeks post transplantation.
The RUNX1S291fs protein was detected high expression
in spleen and low expression in BM in RX291/NS and
RX291/FE groups, but not in Empty/NS and Empty/FE
mice (Figure 1C), suggesting that RUNX1S291fs was suc￾cessfully transduced and expressed. We then examined
whether RUNX1S291fs contributes to the development of
MDS in recipient mice. The mice received RUNX1S291fs￾transduced cells showed significantly reduced white blood
cell (WBC) counts (Figure 1D), hemoglobin (HG) levels
(Figure 1E), platelet counts (PLT) (Figure 1F), and increased
mean corpuscular volume (MCV) (Figure 1G) compared
with Empty control recipient mice. The RUNX1S291fs
mutant mice also showed dysplastic cells, such as dot-like
and polychromatic erythrocytes, giant platelets, pseudo￾Pelger-Huet granulocytes in the PB, together with dual￾nucleated granulocytes, increased immature blasts (less
than 20%) in the BM, characteristic of human MDS
(Figure 1H). Then we examined the pathological changes
in the femur, liver and spleen. The femur showed
extremely active myeloid hyperplasia, mainly in blast
cells, with the increased ratio of granulocyte/red cells and
abnormal localization of blast precursor cells in
RUNX1S291fs mice but not Empty control mice (Figure
1I). Moreover, the RUNX1S291fs mice showed many
nucleated cells around the central vein and the portal area
of the liver, and exhibited enlargement and irregular shape

of white pulp and narrow red pulp, whereas such patho￾logical changes were not found in Empty control mice
(Figure 1I). Collectively, our RUNX1S291fs-induced mice
model showed neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia
and multilineage dysplasia, together with less than 20%
blasts, matching the criteria of MDS in the Bethesda pro￾posal and phenotypically recapitulating human MDS.
Next, we examined whether iron overload model can be
established in RUNX1S291fs induced MDS mice. We and
others previously reported that iron overload can cause
liver and spleen enlargement.12,13 There was a clear
increase in liver and spleen weight in both control mice
and in MDS mice administered iron dextran treatment,
implying that iron can deposit in the liver and spleen in
RUNX1S291fs-induced MDS mice (Figures 1H, and 2A
and B). We further performed Perl’s iron staining to verify
iron deposition in mice tissues and organs. Significant iron
deposition could be observed in the liver, spleen and BM
in RX291/FE group compared to RX291/NS mice (Figure
2C), supporting iron overload in RX291/FE mice. In addi￾tion, our data showed the level of ferritin was almost
undetectable in Empty/NS, while it was significantly high￾er in RX291/NS mice (Figure 2D), which can be clearly
explained by ineffective erythropoiesis in MDS. However,
the ferritin in Empty/FE and RX291/FE group was compa￾rable, and was more significant than in Empty/NS and
RX291/NS mice, respectively (Figure 2D), indicating that
iron overload can also be established in MDS mice. Taken
together, administration of iron dextran by intraperitoneal
injection confers iron deposition in organs, liver and
spleen enlargement, and can be used to facilitate the estab￾lishment of an iron overload model in RUNX1S291fs￾induced MDS mice.
Iron overload impairs the frequency of normal HSPCs
and affects erythroid maturation in MDS mice
To understand how iron overload influences the
hematopoietic system, we first evaluated WBC, PLT and
HG counts. However, our experiment showed no statisti￾cal difference but a downward trend in the PB between
the group treated with iron and that treated with normal
saline in both control mice and MDS mice (Figure 1D-F).
We further analyzed the frequency of HSCs 
(Lin–
c-Kit+
Sca1+
/LSK) and HPCs (Lin–
c-Kit+
Sca1–
/LK) in BM
(Figure 3A) and we found that there were significantly
more normal (GFP–
) HSCs in MDS mice than in control
mice, which may due to extremely active myeloid hyper￾plasia in MDS. In addition, iron overload can significantly
decrease the number of GFP– HSCs in both control and
MDS mice. However, we did not observe any significance
about mutant (GFP+
) HSCs in RX291/NS and RX291/FE
mice (Figure 3B). A similar result can be seen regarding the
change in normal and mutant HPCs in these groups
(Figure 3C). Next, we analyzed erythroid differentiation
through CD71 and Ter119 gating (Figure 3D). We referred
to proerythroblasts, basophilic erythroblasts, polychro￾IO impairs normal HSPCs and survival in MDS mice

matophilic erythroblasts and orthochromatic erythrob￾lasts as E1, E2, E3 and E4, respectively. Compared to
Empty mice, MDS mice showed a significant increase in
the number of GFP- E1 and a significant decrease in GFP￾E2 (Figure 3E), which may due to erythroid dysmaturity in
MDS. Of note, iron overload can significantly reduce the
frequency of E3 and E4 in control mice and GFP– E1 in
MDS mice, while it did not exhibit any significant inhibi￾tion in GFP+ MDS erythroid cells, which may suggest that
iron overload has a negative effect on normal
hematopoiesis in erythroid, but not malignant clones.
Collectively, our study shows that iron overload impairs
the frequency of normal HSPCs and may inhibit erythroid
maturation in MDS mice.
Iron overload compromises the erythroid 
colony-forming capacity of normal HSPCs in MDS mice
We next wanted to examine if iron overload has a neg￾ative impact on HSPCs function in MDS mice. Therefore,
we collected BM cells and determined the colony-forming
capacity or hematopoietic cells reconstitution ability of
these cells. Our data showed that normal (GFP–
) HSPCs in
MDS mice have a significantly lower ability to form
colony-forming unit erythroid (CFU-E), burst-forming unit
erythroid (BFU-E), and colony-forming unit granulocyte,
erythroid, macrophage, megakarycyte (CFU-GEMM)
colonies compared to control mice (Figure 4A). What is
more, iron overload can markedly inhibit CFU-E and BFU￾E of GFP- HSPCs in both control and MDS mice. We also
tested a serial replating assay about GFP– HSPCs (Figure
4B). Despite the fact that the first plating did not show sig￾nificantly reduced clonogenic numbers, but there seemed
to be a declining trend between Empty/NS and Empty/FE
mice, the count of clonogenic HSPCs exhibited a marked
decline at the second and subsequent platings (Figure 4B),
which supported the view that the colony-forming capac￾ity of normal HSPCs was suppressed by iron overload in
MDS mice. Because GFP+ HSPCs were unable to form
colonies but clusters compared to GFP– HSPCs (Figure 4C),
we performed competitive repopulation assay to identify
the effect of iron overload on the hematopoietic reconsti￾tution capacity of GFP+ cells (Figure 4D). To our surprise,
the chimerism of GFP+ cells from RX291/FE mice was not
significant compared to those of RX291/NS mice (Figure
4D), indicating that iron overload may not damage the
hematopoietic reconstitution capacity of GFP+ HSPCs.
Together, we conclude that iron overload can compromise
the erythroid colony-forming capacity of normal HSPCs,
but may not affect the hematopoietic reconstitution
capacity of abnormal HSPCs in MDS.
Iron overload inhibits erythroid hematopoiesis in MDS
mice through ROS
These data showed that iron overload inhibits ery￾throid hematopoiesis in MDS mice. We next investigated
the mechanisms involved in this process. Previous stud￾ies have reported that enhanced apoptosis of BM cells in
MDS can cause pancytopenia.7 Indeed, our data showed
that the level of apoptosis in RX291/NS and RX291/FE
mice was significantly increased compared to Empty/NS
and Empty/FE group (Figure 5A), respectively, consistent
with previous studies.8 In addition, iron overload can

induce apoptosis of BM cells in normal mice (Figure 5A),
which has previously been confirmed by others.14 Of
note, normal (GFP–
) BM cells in RX291/FE mice have a
markedly higher apoptosis level than those of RX291/NS
mice, but not mutant (GFP+
) cells (Figure 5A), implying
that iron overload can promote apoptosis of normal BM
cells in MDS. It has been reported that ROS can induce
apoptosis.14 Our data showed that the ROS level was
also clearly higher in RX291/FE mice than that of
RX291/NS mice (Figure 5B) in BM. And erythroid cells in
BM presented similar changes (Figure 5C). We also
detected the mRNA levels of NOX4 related to ROS gen￾IO impairs normal HSPCs and survival in MDS mice

eration and GPX1 involved in ROS clearance in erythroid
cells. Interestingly, the expression of NOX4 was signifi￾cantly higher in RX291/FE mice than that of RX291/NS
mice (Figure 5D), while the level of GPX1 was signifi￾cantly lower in the RX291/FE group (Figure 5E), support￾ing the view that iron overload can induce ROS to dam￾age erythroid hematopoiesis. Previous studies have
reported that TGF-b signaling is myelosuppressive and
inhibits erythroid differentiation by induction of ROS
and apoptosis in erythroblasts.15-17 We then examined the
mRNA levels of TGF-b superfamily including GDF8,
GDF11, GDF15, Activin A, Activin B, Acvr2b, ALK4, and
ALK5, and found that GDF11 mRNA levels were signifi￾cantly increased in RX291/FE mice compared to
RX291/NS mice (Figure 5F). We further detected the
GDF11 protein levels in serum, which showed similar
results in these two groups (Figure 5G). Collectively, iron
overload can damage erythroid hematopoiesis in MDS
mice, which may partially be due to GDF11-induced
ROS, leading to enhanced apoptosis of normal BM cells
and inhibition of their function in MDS.
Iron overload shortens survival MDS mice
Given that iron overload results in a suppressive effect
in the frequency and function of normal HSPCs in MDS
mice, we postulated that iron overload can affect the
median survival of these mice. The mice were observed
for 360 days post transplantation and each group has more
than ten mice. In our study, MDS mice have an obviously
shorter median survival time than control mice (Figure 6),
mostly due to AML transformation. For control mice, the
survival time did not differ between Empty/NS and
Empty/FE mice because the experiment was terminated at
the end of day 360. However, RX291/FE mice exhibited a
significantly shorter median survival than RX291/NS mice
(Figure 6), suggesting that iron overload can shorten the
survival time of MDS mice.
Discussion
Myelodysplastic syndrome is a heterogeneous group of
clonal stem cell disorders characterized by multilineage
dysplasia, ineffective hematopoiesis, pancytopenia, and
with a high risk of developing into acute myeloid
leukemia.18 Over recent years, investigators all over the
world have been trying hard to establish an MDS model
to further study this disease. However, only a few mouse
models are available for human MDS. RUNX1 is a fre￾quently mutated gene in MDS7 and RUNX1S291fs is one
of the most common mutations in RUNX1. It has been
demonstrated that transduction of this mutant into BM
cells can be used to construct MDS mice.8 Indeed, our
RUNX1S291fs-induced mice showed neutropenia, ane￾mia, thrombocytopenia, multilineage dysplasia, together
with less than 20% blasts, matching the criteria of MDS in
the Bethesda proposal and phenotypically recapitulating
human MDS.
Due to frequent blood transfusions and ineffective
hematopoiesis, most MDS patients will eventually devel￾op iron overload. Excessive iron deposits in the tissues
and organs cause a series of complications, affecting the
prognosis of MDS patients. In turn, iron overload has a
negative role in hematopoiesis in MDS, further deteriorat￾ing the situation of these patients. To understand how
iron overload influences hematopoiesis in MDS, we first
established an iron overload model in RUNX1S291fs￾induced MDS mice by intraperitoneal injection of iron
dextran. Our data presented more iron deposition in
organs, and more significant liver and spleen enlargement
in RX291/FE mice, supporting the successful establish￾ment of an iron overload model in RUNX1S291fs-induced
MDS mice. In the present study, although there was no
statistical significance in the levels of WBC, PLT and HG
in the PB between Empty/NS and Empty/FE, we observed
a declining trend in Empty/FE relative to Empty/NS mice,

similar to our previous study.13 We also obtained similar
results in the PB between the two groups of MDS mice. In
addition, we found that iron overload impairs the frequen￾cy of normal HSPCs, especially in erythroid cells, but not
abnormal HSPCs in MDS mice. We further investigated
the impact of iron overload on HSPCs function and found
that iron overload compromises the erythroid colony￾forming capacity of normal HSPCs, but may not affect the
hematopoietic reconstitution capacity of abnormal HSPCs
in MDS mice. In addition, RX291/FE mice have a shorter
median survival than RX291/NS mice, indicating that iron
overload can shorten survival time in MDS mice. There
are increasing data to show that oxidative stress was
increased in BM cells of patients with iron overload, and
antioxidant or iron chelator therapy could partially rescue
the impaired hematopoietic function of patients, which
indicates the presence of ROS-induced cellular injury.19,23
Of interest, we detected the level of ROS and found it sig￾nificantly increased in RX291/FE compared with
RX291/NS group, suggesting that iron overload impairs
normal HSPCs, at least in part, via inducing ROS in MDS,
consistent with previous studies.19,24 Our data showed that
iron overload decreased the number of HSPCs partially
due to ROS-induced apoptosis. However, whether the
reduced HSPCs was regulated by HIF-1a/ROS or NF-κB
pathway warrants further investigation.20,24 It has been
reported that the TGF-b pathway is myelosuppressive
and inhibits erythroid differentiation by induction of ROS
and apoptosis in erythroblasts.15-17,25 Our data showed in
GDF11, one of the TGF-b superfamilies, mRNA and pro￾tein levels significantly increased in RX291/FE mice com￾pared to RX291/NS mice, suggesting that iron overload
can damage erythroid hematopoiesis in MDS mice, which
may partially be due to GDF11-induced ROS, leading to
enhanced apoptosis of normal BM cells and inhibition of
their function in MDS. However, additional studies are
needed to clarify whether GDF11-induced ROS and apop￾tosis of erythroid was related to the Fas-Fas ligand path￾way.16,25 Interestingly, Masayo et al. found that iron over￾load can activate glucose metabolism and increase DNA
methylation, which is associated with MDS pathogenesis
and progression, and iron chelation can reverse these
effects.26 Therefore, future studies should be conducted to
evaluate the impact of iron overload on metabolic path￾ways such as glucose and lipid involved in MDS patho￾genesis in our model. In addition, our mice can be used to
illustrate the association between oxidative imbalance and
iron overload in MDS.18 Our previous study showed that
damaged mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) were related
to iron overload induced ROS in normal mice.21 However,
Zheng et al. reported that iron overload damages MSC
through AMPK/MFF/Drp1 pathway in MDS.27 Thus, fur￾ther research should investigate the effect of iron over￾load on the BM microenvironment in MDS.
In conclusion, our preliminary findings suggest that iron
overload impairs the frequency and function of normal
HSPCs, particularly in erythroid, at least in part via
GDF11-induced ROS, and shortens survival in MDS.
Given that there are a few MDS models available, and we
are the first to utilize RUNX1-S291fs-induced MDS mice
to successfully construct an iron overload model, we hope
this model will be helpful for further exploring the influ￾ence and mechanism of iron overload on MDS.
