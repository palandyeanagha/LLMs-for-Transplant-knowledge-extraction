ARTICLE FIGURES AND DATA INFO AND METRICS
Thrombocytopenia is common in cancer patients; it may be
secondary to the malignancy itself, its treatment, or other
etiologies, such as liver disease or infection. In the absence of any
currently effective therapy to prevent thrombocytopenia, the usual
clinical response is to decrease the dose and/or frequency of
chemotherapy, change to less toxic regimens, or stop therapy
altogether.1 Unfortunately, these reactions to thrombocytopenia
may reduce therapeutic benefit (and possibly survival) due to
inadequate dose intensity or inferior regimens.2
While platelet transfusion is the customary treatment for severe
chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia, only oprelvekin has
received regulatory approval for prevention3 but has adverse effects
severely limiting its use. With the discovery of thrombopoietin, two
recombinant thrombopoietins [recombinant human thrombopoietin
(rhTPO) and pegylated recombinant megakaryocyte growth and
development factor (PEG-rhMGDF)] underwent extensive study in
patients receiving chemotherapy and were found to decrease the


need for platelet transfusions,4 increase nadir platelet counts, and
improve dose intensity.5 Unfortunately, antibody formation to PEG-
rhMGDF ended these developments6 except in China where rhTPO
(TPIAO™) is widely used to treat chemotherapy-induced
thrombocytopenia.
The development of the thrombopoietin receptor agonists
romiplostim and eltrombopag has rekindled interest in treating
chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia.7 Over the past 8 years
romiplostim has been used increasingly at our institution to treat
chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia, despite this being an off-
label use. This is a retrospective analysis of the patients thus
treated, assessing the effects of romiplostim on platelet count, time
to platelet count >100×10/L, chemotherapy dose reductions and
delay, and romiplostim-related complications. This study was
approved by the Institutional Review Board (approval
2015P000152/PHS) of Massachusetts General Hospital.
Between January 1, 2010 and April 17, 2017, all patients aged ≥18
years who received romiplostim were identified from the records at
Massachusetts General Hospital and those who receiving
romiplostim concurrently with cancer chemotherapy for a solid
tumor were selected for analysis. Moribund patients and those who
received fewer than two doses of romiplostim were excluded. The
data collected included the patients’ age, gender, malignancy type
and stage, chemotherapy agents with doses and number of cycles,
cause(s) of thrombocytopenia, platelet counts, dates and doses of
romiplostim, red blood cell and platelet transfusions, bleeding and
thrombotic events.
Of 42 cancer patients treated with chemotherapy and romiplostim,
14 had hematologic malignancies (and were therefore excluded)
and 28 had solid tumors; of these 28, 22 met the inclusion criteria.
Of the six patients with solid tumors who were excluded, one died
of malignancy complications before receiving chemotherapy, two
received only one dose of romiplostim, and data were incomplete
for three. The median age of the patients was 67 years (range, 21–
85), 41% were female. They had a variety of different types of
tumor and received a range of treatments. Nineteen patients
received cytotoxic chemotherapy, two targeted oral therapy, and


one a combination of cytotoxic chemotherapy and targeted oral
therapy (Table 1). Most patients had a gastrointestinal malignancy,
and the most common chemotherapy regimen was oxaliplatin, 5-
fluorouracil and leucovorin. In the 30-day period before
romiplostim treatment, the patients’ median nadir platelet count
was 58×10/L; all patients who had received chemotherapy within
30 days before romiplostim treatment had had a platelet count
nadir <100×10/L. On the first day of romiplostim treatment, the
median platelet count was 74×10/L (range, 21–145×10/L); 50%
of patients had platelet counts <75×10/L and 77% had counts
<100×10/L. Eighteen patients received romiplostim for
chemotherapy-associated thrombocytopenia. Four patients with pre-
existing thrombocytopenic conditions, three with chronic immune
thrombocytopenia (pre-treatment platelet counts 95×10/L,
145×10/L, and 79×10/L) and one with liver cirrhosis (pre-
treatment platelet count 73×10/L), had not received prior
chemotherapy and were given romiplostim in anticipation of
chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia.

Table 1.Baseline characteristics.
Romiplostim was given weekly, usually on the same day as
chemotherapy, and continued until the completion of
chemotherapy. The most common (and median) starting dose was 3
μg/kg (range, 1–10 μg/kg). Platelet counts were measured weekly
with romiplostim administration; the dose of romiplostim was
changed one or more times in 14 patients. For patients with
baseline platelet counts <75×10/L, a median duration of 7 days of
romiplostim therapy (a single dose) was required to achieve a
platelet count ≥75×10/L. Similarly, a median of only 7 days of
therapy was needed to bring those patients with baseline platelets
<100×10/L to above the 100×10/L threshold. Ten of 17 (59%)
patients with baseline platelet counts <100×10/L achieved counts
≥100×10/L 1 week after a single dose of romiplostim; three
additional patients (18%) achieved platelet counts ≥100×10/L
after two or three weekly doses; the remaining three patients
required seven to 12 weekly doses to reach this threshold. An


illustrative trend in platelet counts in one patient is shown in Figure
2. One patient with known bone marrow infiltration by breast
carcinoma never achieved a platelet count ≥100×10/L. During
romiplostim treatment, 83% and 71% of all platelet counts were
≥75×10/L and ≥100×10/L, respectively.

Figure 2.Representative platelet counts obtained on dates of
romiplostim administration for an 85-year old man with localized
pancreatic adenocarcinoma who received adjuvant gemcitabine
with romiplostim support. The dose was 3 μg/kg weekly at
initiation on day 0, increased to 6 μg/kg weekly on day 43,
decreased to 5 μg/kg weekly on day 57, and was discontinued on
day 149 at completion of chemotherapy.
All 22 patients received two or more cycles of chemotherapy
(range, 2–18) while on romiplostim. Four required chemotherapy
dose-reductions despite romiplostim; all others proceeded with
chemotherapy at, or above, the dose intensity of the cycle
immediately before starting romiplostim treatment. Of the 18
patients who received chemotherapy prior to romiplostim, 17
(94%) had chemotherapy delays attributed to thrombocytopenia,
with a median per-patient cumulative delay time of 4 weeks (range,
1–11). Eight of all 22 (36%) patients concurrently treated with
romiplostim and chemotherapy had such delays (P=0.0002,
Pearson c test, compared with pretreatment), with a median per-
patient cumulative delay dropping to 1 week (range, 1–4).
Of the 18 patients who received chemotherapy prior to
romiplostim, 14 (78%) had required at least one chemotherapy dose
reduction attributed to thrombocytopenia; four of all 22 (18%)
patients required at least one such dose reduction on romiplostim


(P=0.0002, Pearson chi-squared test, compared with pre-
treatment).
No patient had a thrombotic event while receiving romiplostim.
Three patients (14%) suffered bleeding [1 grade 1 mucosal bleed
(platelet count 19×10/L) and 2 grade 3 gastrointestinal bleeds
(platelet counts 80×10/L and 239×10/L)] but did not require
platelet transfusions. Four patients (18%) received platelet
transfusions (2 in preparation for paracentesis; 1 for a patient who
was anemic and thrombocytopenic but not bleeding, 1 to boost the
platelet count while receiving chemotherapy). Ten patients (46%)
were given red blood cell transfusions while receiving romiplostim,
eight of whom for chemotherapy-associated anemia or fatigue.
Few studies have explored use of thrombopoietin receptor agonists
in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia in
cancer patients. In one retrospective analysis,8 romiplostim was
used to treat 20 solid tumor patients with at least 6 weeks of
chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia (platelet counts
<100×10/L). As in our study, this report described that one or two
weekly doses of romiplostim raised platelet counts ≥100×10/L
and allowed further chemotherapy in most patients, but it did not
examine other chemotherapy-related outcomes (e.g., chemotherapy
delays). Our study demonstrated that romiplostim statistically
significantly reduced chemotherapy delays and dose-reductions due
to thrombocytopenia. In addition, romiplostim successfully raised
platelet counts in patients with pre-existing thrombocytopenic
conditions (e.g., immune thrombocytopenia and cirrhosis) who
required chemotherapy.
There were no apparent adverse effects of romiplostim
administration in our study. Six patients had platelet counts
≥400×10/L on at least one measurement, prompting dose
reductions. Of note, three of these patients had not received prior
chemotherapy but had immune thrombocytopenia or liver disease
and were given romiplostim to prevent the development of
chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia; all developed platelet
counts ≥400×10/L after the first two doses of romiplostim and
subsequently had lower platelet counts following romiplostim dose
reductions. There were no cases of venous or arterial thrombosis in


our study, but three cases of deep vein thrombosis occurred in the
aforementioned published study of 20 patients.8 Bleeding occurred
in three patients but was related to thrombocytopenia in only one.
While four patients required platelet transfusions, two were
transfused in preparation for a procedure based solely on the
physicians’ preferences, and only one to enable chemotherapy to be
continued.
The flaws of this retrospective study are apparent. This was a non-
blinded, non-randomized study of patients with a variety of solid
tumors receiving many different chemotherapy regimens. Initial
romiplostim dosing was reasonably uniform, but there was no
standard for changing or withholding doses. Some patients had
doses withheld because of concern of impending thrombocytosis;
patients whose romiplostim doses were withheld more frequently
subsequently developed platelet counts <100×10/L. In general,
chemotherapy was resumed once the counts were ≥100×10/L.
Nonetheless, our data show that romiplostim treatment increased
the platelet count to ≥100×10/L in 94% of patients who started
with counts below this threshold, the majority achieving this goal
after one dose. The only exception was one patient who never
achieved this goal, possibly because of biopsy-proven infiltration of
the bone marrow by malignancy.
This study also illustrates three major flaws inherent in all studies
of chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia: (i) there is no uniform
standard in oncology practice as to when chemotherapy dosage
should be adjusted or withheld to avoid thrombocytopenia and
bleeding; (ii) there is no consensus as to what constitutes a “safe”
platelet count during chemotherapy; and (iii) there is little evidence
that raising the platelet count affects survival. While raising the
platelet count clearly reduces platelet transfusions4 and allows
chemotherapy to be given on time,5 only one small study with PEG-
rhMGDF suggested improved survival of patients undergoing
treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.9
This study provides evidence that, in patients with solid tumors and
chemotherapy-associated thrombocytopenia or co-existing
thrombocytopenic disorders, romiplostim is safe and rapidly
increases the platelet count in most such patients, thereby allowing


subsequent chemotherapy to be given at full dose and on schedule.
Although romiplostim is a widely-used supportive care modality at
our institution, the magnitude of its benefit and ultimate effect on
patients’ survival can only be assessed in properly controlled,
prospective studies.
