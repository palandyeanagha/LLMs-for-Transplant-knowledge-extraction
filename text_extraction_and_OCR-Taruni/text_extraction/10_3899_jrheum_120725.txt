ABSTRACT. Objective. Biomarkers of progression of interstitial lung disease (ILD) are needed to allow early
therapeutic intervention in patients with scleroderma-associated disease (SSc-ILD).
Methods. A panel of 8 serum cytokines [interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-8, IL-10, CCL2, CXCL10, vascular
endothelial growth factor, fibroblast growth factor 2, and CX3CL1] was assessed by Luminex bead
technology in exploratory cohorts of 74 patients with SSc and 58 patients with idiopathic pulmonary
fibrosis (IPF). Mortality and significant lung function decline [forced vital capacity (FVC) ≥ 10%;
DLCO ≥ 15%] from date of serum collection were evaluated by proportional hazards analysis. Based
on these findings, the prognostic value of serum IL-6, evaluated by ELISA, was assessed in a larger
test cohort of 212 patients with SSc-ILD. 
Results. In the exploratory cohort, only serum IL-6 was an independent predictor of DLCO decline
in both IPF and SSc-ILD. The IL-6 threshold level most predictive of DLCO decline within a year
was 7.67 pg/ml. In the larger test cohort, serum IL-6 > 7.67 pg/ml was predictive of decline in FVC
(HR 2.58 ± 0.98, p = 0.01) and in DLCO (HR 3.2 ± 1.7, p = 0.02) within the first year, and predictive
of death within the first 30 months (HR 2.69 ± 0.96, p = 0.005). When stratified according to severity
(FVC < 70%), serum IL-6 > 7.67 pg/ml was predictive of functional decline or death within the first
year in patients with milder disease (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.4–7.2, p = 0.007), but not in those with severe
ILD. 
Conclusion. In SSc-ILD, serum IL-6 levels appear to be predictive of early disease progression in
patients with mild ILD, and could be used to target treatment in this group, if confirmed by
prospective studies. (J Rheumatol First Release Feb 1 2013; doi:10.3899/jrheum.120725)

Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune condition
characterized by tissue fibrosis of the skin and internal
organs. Interstitial lung disease associated with SSc
(SSc-ILD) accounts for about one-third of deaths1,2,3.
Clinical variables associated with a higher risk of
progression of SSc-ILD include severity of lung

involvement and a diagnosis of SSc within the previous 4
years4. Recently, Goh and co-authors have proposed a simple
2-stage “mild”/“extensive” system to identify SSc-ILD
patients with a worse prognosis, based on rapid assessment
of the extent of disease on high-resolution computed tomo￾graphy (HRCT) with recourse, in “indeterminate” cases, to
lung-function data5. In addition, a marker of epithelial injury
has recently been observed to predict likelihood of lung
function decline in SSc-ILD, independently of disease
severity, in a large number of patients with SSc6.
Although these studies signal significant advances in our
ability to predict behavior of lung disease in the context of
SSc, additional noninvasive markers of likelihood of disease
progression are needed to target patients with SSc-ILD at
risk of progression. In particular, in mild disease there is a
need to identify patients at higher risk of progression to
extensive disease with a view to early protective therapy.
Among serum biomarkers linked to lung fibrosis in SSc, the
most studied have been markers of epithelial cell damage,
including KL-6 and surfactant7,8. However, to our knowledge,
there has been only 1 large study specifically investigating
whether serum biomarkers identify progressive disease, once
lung disease severity has been taken into account9.
We conducted an exploratory analysis with a panel of 8
serum cytokines using a multianalyte assay system in 74
patients with SSc. As an additional disease group, we also
studied 58 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF),
the most common idiopathic ILD, characterized by a signif￾icantly worse prognosis than SSc-ILD10. The cytokines
were selected on the basis of published data suggesting links
with lung fibrosis and previous investigations in our
laboratory11,12. We then selected serum interleukin 6 (IL-6)
to be tested further as a predictor of progression of lung
disease and mortality in a larger cohort of 212 patients with
SSc-ILD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients. Patients with SSc met American Rheumatism Association prelim￾inary criteria for a diagnosis of SSc13, with the exclusion of those with
“overlap” connective tissue disorders. Patients with IPF met the American
Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) diagnostic
criteria14. In both disease groups, patients were excluded if they had overt
concurrent malignant disease, severe heart disease, and severe pulmonary
hypertension associated with right heart failure.
Exploratory cohort. The discovery cohort consisted of 74 patients with SSc
and 58 patients with IPF evaluated at the Interstitial Lung Disease Unit,
Royal Brompton Hospital, London, from whom serum samples had been
collected at first presentation, between January 1991 and August 2006.
Control samples were obtained from 20 nonsmoking healthy volunteers.
Serum levels of 8 cytokines were assessed as described below.
Test cohort. To test associations between serum IL-6 and ILD progression
and survival, we assessed a second group of 212 patients with SSc-ILD
seen at the Royal Brompton Hospital and/or the Royal Free Hospital,
London. Serum was collected from these patients from February 1982 to
October 2004.
Blood (10 ml) was drawn from all patients using standardized
phlebotomy procedures. Serum was separated by centrifugation, and all
specimens were immediately aliquoted and stored at –80°C. 
Clinical data. Of the 74 patients with SSc (first set), 20 had no or trivial
ILD (average extent on CT < 5%). Investigations were carried out as part
of a routine clinical protocol. Informed consent and ethical approval from
the Royal Brompton and Royal Free Hospital Ethics Committee were
obtained for both sets.
Pulmonary function tests, HRCT, echocardiography, and 99mTc-techne￾tium-labeled diethylene-triamine-pentacetate (DTPA) clearance were
performed as reported15,16,17. Ever-smokers were defined as individuals
who had smoked > 1 cigarette/day for at least 1 year. Treatment was
defined as corticosteroid (prednisolone ≥ 1 mg/day) and/or immunosup￾pressant (cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, mycophenolate) therapy.
Pulmonary hypertension was defined as estimated right ventricular systolic
pressure ≥ 40 mm Hg on echocardiogram. Erythrocyte sedimentation rates
(ESR) within 6 months from serum collection were available for 35 IPF
patients (60%) and 54 SSc patients (73%) in the exploratory set, and for
168 SSc patients in the test set (79%).
Initial lung function assessment was performed within 3 months of
serum collection for all patients in the exploratory set. In the test set of 212
patients, lung function assessment within 6 months of serum collection was
available for 172 patients, and within 12 months in the others. The
composite physiologic index (CPI), a functional index of lung fibrosis
severity, was calculated as follows: CPI = 91.0 – (0.65 × DLCO %pred) –
(0.53 × FVC %pred) + (0.34 × FEV1 %pred)18, and was available for all
patients. Although initially developed in IPF, the CPI has subsequently
been used as an index of severity in SSc-ILD6 and in other ILD19. CPI was
used as a continuous variable in multivariate analyses to adjust for ILD
severity. Further, patients were stratified into those with mild and those
with severe ILD depending on a threshold for FVC of 70%, chosen as the
functional severity threshold most predictive of disease progression in
SSc-ILD5. In the test set of patients, DTPA clearance measures were
available within 6 months of serum collection in 110 patients. 
Functional deterioration (“time to decline”) was identified using
ATS/ERS criteria (≥ 10% decline in FVC, ≥ 15% decline in DLCO)20 and
quantified as described16. It was considered clinically significant when
observed on at least 2 consecutive occasions. When followup ended with
functional deterioration on a single occasion, it was accepted as significant
decline only if there was symptomatic and/or HRCT evidence of
worsening. “Time to decline” was assessed only in patients who had lung
function testing within 6 months of serum collection and for whom longi￾tudinal lung function data were available (n = 116 in the exploratory set; n
= 172 in the test set). Progression-free survival, defined as the time to
functional decline (of FVC and/or DLCO) or death, was also assessed.
Clinical characteristics of both patient sets are shown in Table 1.
Detection of serum proteins. In the exploratory set, an 8-plex assay was
performed for IL-6, IL-8, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2/MCP-1),
IL-10, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 10 (CXCL10/IP-10), vascular
endothelial growth factor, fibroblast growth factor 2, and chemokine
(C-X3-C motif) ligand 1 (CX3CL1/fractalkine). Assays were performed
using fluorescent bead-based technology (Luminex Corp.) in 96-well
microplate format, in compliance with the kit manufacturer’s instructions,
as described11. The fluorescent beads were obtained from Millipore.
Antibody-conjugated beads were prepared and aliquoted into a 96-well pre￾wetted filter plate, before addition of either 100 µl standard solution in the
designated wells or 100 µl serum, diluted 1:2 with assay diluent.
Subsequent steps involved washes interspersed by the addition of biotiny￾lated detector antibody and later streptavidin-RPE solution. Finally, the
plate was placed on the XY platform of the Luminex 100 instrument for
analysis. StarStation software was used for data acquisition and analysis.
Standard curves were generated for each analyte, and the mean fluores￾cence intensity value of each analyte in each well was converted into a
concentration using the linear portion of the standard for all detected
values. This value was then multiplied by the dilution coefficient 2 to give
the concentration of the analyte in the original serum. 
In the test set, quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay for human

IL-6 was performed as recommended by the manufacturer (R&D Systems)
in 212 serum samples from patients with SSc.
Statistical analysis. All data are shown as medians or geometric means,
unless otherwise indicated. Serum cytokine levels were log-transformed to
improve normality of the data distribution and homoscedasticity of
variances. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test or chi-square test was used to
compare clinical characteristics and cytokine levels between different
clinical groups, as appropriate. Spearman’s rank correlation, phi corre￾lation, or point-biserial coefficient of correlation, as appropriate, were used
to analyze relationships among cytokine levels and between cytokine levels
and severity indices. Serum biomarkers were examined against mortality
and functional decline using Cox proportional hazard analysis. Aalen’s
linear hazard model was used to estimate temporal variations of regression
coefficients21. Age, sex, smoking status, and lung disease severity (CPI)
were included in all models. DTPA data were considered only when
available within 6 months from the serum sample. To determine the optimal
threshold predictive of disease progression, the point on the
receiver-operator curve (ROC) with the maximum Youden index (Youden
index = sensitivity + specificity – 1) was calculated. Analyses were
performed using Stata 10.1 and p values ≤ 0.05 were considered statisti￾cally significant. In the exploratory set, to account for multiple testing, 
p values were corrected by the number of cytokines tested (pc = Bonfer￾roni-corrected p value).
RESULTS
Serum cytokines in the exploratory set. Serum cytokine
levels in SSc and IPF patients and controls are shown in
Table 2. After Bonferroni correction for multiple testing,
serum levels of IL-6 and CXCL10 remained significantly
higher in both SSc and IPF patients compared to controls
(IL-6: SSc vs control, pc = 0.01; IPF vs control, pc = 0.02;
CXCL10: SSc vs control, pc = 0.01; IPF vs control, pc <
0.0008). CCL2 was significantly higher in IPF (pc = 0.002),
while bordering on significance in SSc (pc = 0.054),
compared to controls (Table 2, Appendix 1). Observed
differences in other cytokine levels between SSc, IPF, and
control groups did not reach statistical significance after
Bonferroni correction (uncorrected p values in Table 2).
Details on correlations among serum cytokines and between
cytokines, ESR, and lung function measures are given in
Appendix 2.
The relationship between serum cytokine levels and
disease deterioration was evaluated in both diseases. On
univariate analysis, after Bonferroni correction, only serum
IL-6 was significantly predictive of DLCO deterioration in
both IPF and SSc (pc = 0.02; Table 3). CCL2 was associated
with progression-free survival only in patients with IPF (pc
= 0.008; Table 3). Although significant associations were
observed between other cytokines and disease progression
(Table 3), statistical significance was lost after Bonferroni
correction. No association was seen between ESR levels and
disease progression or survival.

On multivariate analysis, after adjustment for age, sex,
smoking history, pulmonary hypertension, and severity of
lung disease (CPI index), IL-6 remained an independent
predictor of irreversible decline in DLCO in both IPF (HR =
1.38, p = 0.05) and SSc (HR = 2.0, p = 0.002) and
progression-free survival (HR = 1.69, p = 0.003) in patients
with IPF. CCL2 was an independent predictor of
progression-free survival (HR = 2.4, p = 0.003) in IPF, but
not in patients with SSc.
As serum IL-6 was associated with shorter time to
decline in DLCO in both SSc and IPF, threshold analysis
was performed on the combined group (ROC analysis). The
threshold level of serum IL-6 most predictive of DLCO
decline within a year was 7.67 pg/ml (area under the curve
= 0.6, sensitivity 53%, specificity 71%, Youden index
10.24). 
Test set in a larger cohort of patients with SSc. In view of
the observed association between IL-6 and lung function
decline in both SSc and IPF, serum IL-6 was selected for
further testing in a test set of 212 patients with SSc-ILD.
Demographic and clinical data of the test set are summa￾rized in Table 1. Age, sex, smoking status, and functional
status were not significantly different compared to the
exploratory SSc group. Sixty of 212 patients died (28.3%)
during a median followup of 60.5 months; 5-year survival
was 79.7%. Decline in FVC was seen in 84 (48.8%) of 172
patients, with a median time to decline of 39.5 months.
Decline in DLCO was seen in 90 (52.3%) of 172 patients,
with a median time to decline of 41.3 months. Progres￾sion-free survival, defined as time until death or worsening
in FVC and/or DLCO, was observed in 132 patients (71.4%),
with a median progression-free survival of 40.3 months.
Serum IL-6 analyzed as a continuous variable: association
with survival and lung function decline. Analyzed as a
continuous variable, IL-6 levels were significantly
associated to shorter survival (HR = 1.32, 95% CI
1.08–1.62, p = 0.007) and decreased time to decline in FVC
(HR = 1.34, 95% CI 1.12–1.61, p = 0.001), while a
nonsignificant trend was seen for DLCO (HR = 1.14, 95%
CI 0.96–1.36, p = 0.1; Table 4). After adjustment for the

relevant covariates (Table 4), the link between serum IL-6
and time to decline in DLCO was found to be significant
(adjusted HR = 1.5, 95% CI 1.002–2.1, p = 0.048). Details
on the multivariate analyses can be found in Appendix 2.
Serum IL-6 thresholds against functional decline and
survival. We set out to test whether the serum IL-6 threshold
of 7.67 pg/ml observed to be associated with a DLCO
decline in the first year in the exploratory set (see above)
was also predictive of functional decline in the larger test
group. The analysis was performed using Aalen linear
hazards models (Appendix 2). In brief, a serum concen￾tration > 7.67 pg/ml was associated with decline in FVC
(HR = 2.58 ± 0.98, p = 0.013) and decline in DLCO within
the first year (HR = 3.2 ± 1.7, p = 0.02), but not at later
timepoints, and with increased mortality within the first 30
months (HR = 2.58 ± 0.62, p < 0.0001), even after
adjustment for covariates, including age, sex, smoking
history, CPI, ESR, pulmonary hypertension, diffuse skin
disease, and DTPA clearance.

IL-6 might apply to mild disease, severe disease, or both, we
performed an exploratory analysis of the relationship
between serum IL-6 and outcome, according to a FVC
threshold of 70%, established as the functional severity
threshold most predictive of mortality in SSc-ILD5. In view
of the relatively small subgroup numbers, time to functional
decline (FVC and/or DLCO) or death were combined as a
single outcome variable. As shown in Figure 1, serum IL-6
> 7.67 pg/ml was associated with functional decline and/or
death within the first year in patients with milder disease
(FVC > 70%; i.e., functional deterioration or death in 36%
vs 15% in those with IL-6 levels above or below 7.67 pg/ml,
respectively; HR = 3.5, 95% CI 1.6–7.6, p = 0.002), but not
in those with severe disease (FVC < 70%; i.e., disease
progression or death in 39% vs 47% in those with IL-6
levels above or below 7.67 pg/ml, respectively; p = 0.7).
These associations and their effect size did not change after
adjustment for sex, age, smoking status, CPI, ESR, and
pulmonary hypertension. Progression was seen in 15% in
those with mild ILD and low serum IL-6, in contrast to
progression observed in about 40% of patients with mild
ILD/high IL-6, and of those with severe ILD regardless of
serum IL-6.
DISCUSSION
The discovery of informative, noninvasive biomarkers is
particularly relevant in SSc-ILD, where there is a need to
detect likelihood of ILD progression early in the disease. By
investigating a variety of serum cytokines as possible
biomarkers, we found a significant association between
serum IL-6 levels and ILD progression/mortality in a large
cohort of well-characterized patients with SSc-ILD with
longterm functional followup.
A number of cytokines, alveolar epithelial markers, and
acute-phase reactants have been suggested as markers of
lung fibrosis in the context of SSc4,9,22,23,24,25. Serum
epithelial markers KL-6 and surfactant protein D, as well as
CCL18, a marker of alveolar macrophage activation, have
been variously found to be correlated with ILD severity and
disease progression9,22,24,25, while surfactant protein-A
(SP-A) was predictive of early mortality in patients with
IPF26. Similarly, CRP and/or ESR have been linked to lung
involvement in SSc4,23,27. However, only a few studies have
assessed whether serum biomarkers can predict longitudinal

behavior, and whether the predictive value is maintained
after adjustment for lung disease severity, a well-known
prognostic marker27.
The finding that IL-6 predicted early outcome selectively
in milder disease is important. However, this observation
will require further testing in an independent cohort,
because it is derived from an exploratory, posthoc analysis.
The Goh staging system identifies about 40% of patients
with a striking increase in mortality5. In this subgroup,
treatment to stabilize disease is likely to be warranted,
irrespective of biomarker data, because the lung fibrosis is
likely to progress regardless of serum IL-6 status. By
contrast, the remaining 60% of patients with “mild disease”
present a major dilemma to the clinician. Inevitably, some of
these patients must progress in time to extensive disease
with a worse outcome, especially those who lie close to the
threshold for identifying extensive disease. Such patients
should be treated early to prevent progression to extensive
disease, whereas patients with mild disease at low risk of
progression should be carefully observed. The findings from
our study suggest that IL-6 might serve as a valuable
prognostic biomarker in this context.
The analysis of the test cohort showed that elevated IL-6
was predictive of a decline in FVC and/or DLCO within the
first year, and of death within the first 30 months. The lack
of association with progression at later timepoints suggests
that IL-6 might signal the onset of phases of disease
progression, rather than mark different phenotypes of the
disease constitutively characterized by a different prognosis.
Interestingly, a greater predictive effect in earlier timepoints
since measurement has also been described for SP-A protein
in IPF26 and for bronchoalveolar lavage neutrophilia in
SSc-ILD16.
Other acute-phase reactants, including ESR and CRP,
have been shown to be predictive of poor survival in
SSc23,28,29. Indeed, in our study, we confirmed that ESR was
predictive of mortality in the larger test set but not of
SSc-ILD progression. Interestingly, IL-6 remained predic￾tive of early mortality even after adjustment for ESR,
suggesting that serum IL-6 may add useful prognostic infor￾mation beyond that of other common acute-phase reactants.
In the exploratory set, we identified a number of positive
associations between serum cytokines and progression of
lung fibrosis, in part confirming previous reports22,30,
although many of the associations were no longer signif￾icant after correction for multiple comparisons. The finding
that a number of predominantly inflammatory biomarkers
correlated significantly with baseline disease severity in IPF
is interesting, and highlights a potential role for inflam￾matory responses. Serum IL-6 was associated with DLCO
decline even after adjustment by disease severity and
correction for multiple comparisons, without differences
between SSc and IPF, and was therefore considered a good
biomarker candidate to be investigated further. 
That serum IL-6 predicts functional decline in IPF
suggests that it should also be evaluated further as a poten￾tially valuable biomarker in patients with IPF. Collard, et al
reported increased levels of serum IL-6, together with serum
markers of type II epithelial cells and other cytokines,
during acute exacerbations of IPF31. Studies have suggested
a role for IL-6 in promoting fibrosis, and increased levels of
IL-6 have been reported in the serum, bronchoalveolar
lavage, and skin biopsies of patients with SSc32,33,34,35,36.
Lung fibrosis induced by irradiation or bleomycin therapy is
attenuated in IL-6 gene knockout mice37.

functional decline even after adjustment for clearance of
DTPA, a marker of pulmonary epithelial injury recently

Figure 1. Kaplan-Meier curves illustrate time to decline in functional
decline or death (“progression-free survival”) in the first year according to
serum IL-6 threshold of 7.67 pg/ml in patients with SSc-ILD, subdivided
into those with milder disease (FVC ≥ 70%; A) and those with more severe
disease (FVC < 70; B). A. In patients with FVC ≥ 70%, serum IL-6 > 7.67
pg/ml is predictive of significantly shorter progression-free survival (HR
3.5, p = 0.002). B. In patients with FVC < 70%, no difference in
progression-free survival is seen according to serum IL-6 levels. SSc-ILD:

SSc patients6, suggests that IL-6 levels may be identifying
nonepithelial events. These may be related to lympho￾monocytic lineages, lung fibroblasts, and/or the crosstalk
between the two. Of note, IL-6 shifts T cells from regulatory
responses to pathogenic Th17 responses38, and promotes the
differentiation of CD4+ cells to a profibrotic Th2 type while
suppressing Th1 differentiation39. IL-6 production by lung
fibroblasts is enhanced by co-culture with SSc lung-derived
B cells40. IL-6 stimulation induces increased collagen
production in dermal fibroblasts40,41 and in the liver42. IL-6
inhibited apoptosis in IPF but not in control lung fibroblasts,
suggesting a specifically altered IL-6 signaling pathway in
lung fibrosis43.
A number of limitations should be considered when
interpreting our findings. Serum biomarkers provide a
“snapshot” assessment that can be influenced by a variety of
extrapulmonary factors, including age, time of day, and
intercurrent viral infections or other inflammatory condi￾tions. In particular, serum IL-6 is also an acute-phase protein
and, at least in some cases, may be elevated because of acute
intercurrent events independent of SSc and its progression.
Further, in the context of scleroderma, serum biomarkers
could easily reflect extrapulmonary disease activity. Tissue
IL-6 levels are increased in severe skin disease34, and B cell
depletion induced by rituximab was associated with reduced
serum IL-6 in parallel with improvement of skin disease,
suggesting a role for IL-6 in scleroderma skin fibrosis44. The
link between serum IL-6 and early mortality in patients with
SSc could therefore be related to more severe systemic
disease, in addition to progression of ILD. However, the
persistence of an association between IL-6 and ILD
progression even after adjustment for pulmonary hyper￾tension and for diffuse skin disease, 2 powerful risk factors
for mortality in SSc, and confirmation of the association in
2 separate cohorts suggest that despite the inherent
variability of a serum marker, serum IL-6 is linked with lung
disease activity. Finally, the sensitivity and specificity of the
identified IL-6 threshold as a predictor of early DLCO
decline were suboptimal. There are a number of possible
explanations for this. IL-6 is likely to be only one of a
number of variables contributing to progression of lung
fibrosis, and there could be SSc patient subsets where IL-6
plays a more prominent role in disease progression. In
addition, other variables such as intercurrent infections can
also cause elevations in serum IL-6, thereby increasing the
noise of measurement and reducing its specificity. 
A significant association between IL-6 and mortality was
seen only in our test set; the lack of a significant association
in the exploratory group could be related to smaller patient
numbers, with only 8 deaths occurring in the SSc group and
19 in the IPF group in the exploratory set in the first 3 years. 
Serum IL-6 measurement may be a noninvasive
independent predictor of early ILD progression and
mortality in SSc patients with milder ILD, enabling
targeting of treatment for the patients with early disease
most likely to progress. Prospective studies are needed to
confirm these conclusions and to evaluate the role of IL-6 in
lung fibrosis, to assess whether there could be a role for
anti-IL-6 treatment in SSc-ILD.

Serum cytokines in the exploratory set. Serum levels of IL-6 and CXCL10
were significantly higher in both SSc and IPF patients compared to
controls, even after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing (IL-6: SSc vs
control, pc = 0.01; IPF vs control, pc = 0.02; CXCL10: SSc vs control, pc
= 0.01; IPF vs control, pc < 0.0008). CCL2 was significantly higher in IPF
(pc = 0.002), while bordering on significance in SSc (pc = 0.054),
compared to controls (Table 2, Appendix 1).
Significant correlations were observed between most serum cytokines,
as shown by the correlation matrix in Appendix 3. The strongest correla￾tions (r > 0.45) were seen between IL-6 and IL-10 (r = 0.59), CCL2 (r =
0.47), and VEGF (r = 0.49). ESR correlated weakly, among all cytokines,
only with IL-6 (r = 0.2, pc = 0.16; Appendix 3).
In both SSc and IPF, serum IL-6 levels were inversely correlated to
percentage predicted FVC (pc = 0.006, pc = 0.02, respectively). IL-6 was
also correlated with the CPI (pc = 0.006 and pc = 0.08 in IPF and SSc,
respectively; Appendix 4). Correlations and observed trends between

were also observed in both SSc and IPF. IL-8 serum levels were signifi￾cantly correlated with all functional severity indices in IPF, but not in SSc
(Appendix 4).
Of note, ESR did not correlate with any lung function measure
(Appendix 4).
Test set: serum IL-6 analyzed as a continuous variable against survival.
On univariate analysis, a shorter survival was significantly associated with
serum IL-6 levels (HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.08–1.62, p = 0.007; Table 4). Other
predictors included age, severity of lung disease (assessed by CPI, lung
volumes, or DLCO), presence of anticentromere antibodies (ACA), ESR,
and pulmonary hypertension (Table 4). After adjustment for covariates
associated with survival on univariate analysis (age, CPI, pulmonary
hypertension, ESR, and ACA positivity), the association between serum
IL-6 and mortality bordered on significance (adjusted HR 1.24, 95% CI
0.98–1.58, p = 0.077). However, the association between serum IL-6 and
early mortality remained significant, even after adjustment for age, CPI,
pulmonary hypertension, ESR, and ACA positivity [whether calculated at
12 months (adjusted HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.13–3.3, p = 0.02; or at 30 months
(adjusted HR 1.79, 95% CI 1.3–2.5, p = 0.001)].
Test set: serum IL-6 analyzed as a continuous variable against time to
decline in pulmonary function measures. On univariate analysis, serum
IL-6 was associated with a shorter time to decline in FVC (HR 1.34, 95%
CI 1.12–1.61, p = 0.001; Table 4). A trend for association between serum
IL-6 levels and time to decline in DLCO was also observed, although this
did not achieve statistical significance (Table 4). Other predictors of time
to decline of FVC and/or DLCO included baseline severity markers (CPI,
FVC, FEV1, total lung capacity, and DLCO), DTPA clearance, pulmonary
hypertension, and diffuse skin disease (Table 4). Serum ESR was not
predictive of decline in either DLCO or FVC. Serum IL-6 levels remained
significantly predictive of time to decline in FVC after adjustment for age,
sex, smoking status, treatment, DTPA clearance, pulmonary hypertension,
diffuse skin disease, and lung disease severity (measured by CPI; adjusted
HR 1.4, 95% CI 1.08–1.86, p = 0.01). After adjustment for the same
covariates, the link between serum IL-6 and time to decline in DLCO was
also found to reach significance (adjusted HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.002–2.1, p =
0.048).
Test set: serum IL-6 thresholds against ILD progression and survival —
analysis of time trends. We set out to test whether the serum IL-6 threshold
of 7.67 pg/ml observed to be associated with a DLCO decline in the first
year in the exploratory set was also predictive of functional decline in the
larger test group. To formally assess whether the relationship between
serum IL-6 levels and time to disease deterioration or mortality varied
according to the time interval from serum measurement, we examined the
time trend of the association between levels of IL-6 > 7.67 pg/ml and
functional decline/mortality using Aalen’s linear hazards models.
Inspection of plots of cumulative regression coefficients by this method
suggested an association between increased level of serum IL-6 and
separately, either DLCO (Appendix 5, panel A) or FVC decline (Appendix
5, panel B) that was indeed limited to roughly the first 12 months. A DLCO
decline occurred within a year in 21% of the patients with serum IL-6
levels above 7.67 pg/ml and in 8% of those below the threshold. 
Accordingly, a Cox regression model for DLCO decline using 2
time-varying covariates (≤ 12 months and > 12 months) confirmed these
results for the first 12 months (HR 3.2 ± 1.7, p = 0.02) and showed a
nonsignificant effect at later timepoints (HR 1.29 ± 0.37, p = 0.4). The
effect in the first 12 months remained significant after adjustment for age,
sex, smoking history, CPI, pulmonary hypertension, ESR, diffuse skin
disease, and DTPA clearance.
Similar results were obtained with FVC decline, where the plot of the
cumulative regression coefficient also suggested an association between
increased level of serum IL-6 and FVC decline that was limited to roughly
the first 12 months. FVC decline within a year occurred in 25% of the
patients with IL-6 levels above the threshold, and in 11% of those below.
In a Cox model, a serum level of IL-6 > 7.67 pg/ml was significantly
associated to FVC decline in the subsequent 12 months (HR 2.58 ± 0.98, 
p = 0.013), but not at later timepoints (HR 1.45 ± 0.40, p = 0.18). Again,
the effect remained significant after adjustment for demographic variables,
smoking history, CPI, pulmonary hypertension, ESR, diffuse skin disease,
and DTPA clearance.
We also tested the association between elevated serum IL-6 levels and
survival using the same methods as above. Inspection of the plot of
cumulative regression coefficients estimated by Aalen’s linear hazards
model showed that elevated serum IL-6 levels are associated with
increased mortality within roughly the first 30 months (Appendix 5, panel
C). A Cox regression using 3 time-varying covariates (< 12 months, 12 to
30 months, and > 30 months) showed a significant association between
elevated serum IL-6 and death occurring in the first 12 months (HR 2.49 ±
0.81, p = 0.005) and between 12 and 30 months (HR 2.69 ± 0.96, p =
0.005), while by contrast no significant effect was observed at later
timepoints (HR 1.16 ± 0.29, p = 0.544). Overall, the HR for the risk of
death in the first 30 months was 2.58 ± 0.62 (p < 0.0001); this remained
significant after adjustment for demographic variables, smoking history,
CPI, ESR, and pulmonary hypertension.
Finally, repeat ROC analyses performed in the confirmatory set to
detect the risk of functional decline (DLCO and/or FVC decline) within a
year and of early mortality yielded optimal thresholds of 8.42 pg/ml and
7.72 pg/ml, respectively, both very similar to that estimated in the
exploratory set. Kaplan-Meier curves illustrating time to decline in FVC
and/or DLCO and survival according to these thresholds are shown in
Appendix 6 and Appendix 7.
