Introduction
Preeclampsia is a devastating multisystem disorder of pregnancy that occurs in 3%–5% of all pregnan￾cies, manifesting as hypertension with or without proteinuria and/or end-organ damage. Notably, not 
only does preeclampsia account for maternal morbidity, but it also accounts for 30% of all preterm 
deliveries, which results in neonatal intensive care unit admissions, increased health care costs, severe 
neonatal morbidity, and neonatal mortality (1–3). HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low 
platelets) syndrome is the most severe variant of this disorder, and affects approximately 1% of all preg￾nancies (4). While thought to be due to endothelial cell dysfunction, the precise etiology of both pre￾eclampsia and HELLP syndrome remains unclear, resulting in treatment with supportive regimens such 
as fetal monitoring, steroids for fetal lung maturity, magnesium for seizure prophylaxis, management of 
hypertension and ultimately delivery that results in iatrogenic preterm birth (1, 5–7). Furthermore, the 
diagnostic criteria for HELLP syndrome are ambiguous, with 2 distinct sets of criteria (Mississippi and 
Tennessee) based on clinical testing that can be confused by differences in laboratory assays (8).
BACKGROUND. HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets) syndrome is a severe 
variant of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy affecting approximately 1% of all pregnancies, 
and has significant maternal and fetal morbidity. Previously, we showed that upregulation of the 
alternative pathway of complement (APC) plays a role in HELLP syndrome. We hypothesize that 
HELLP syndrome follows a 2-hit disease model similar to atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome 
(aHUS), requiring both genetic susceptibility and an environmental risk factor. Our objective was 
to perform a comparative analysis of the frequency of APC activation and germline mutations in 
affected women and to create a predictive model for identifying HELLP syndrome.
METHODS. Pregnant women with HELLP syndrome, and healthy controls after 23 weeks of 
gestation were recruited, along with aHUS and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura participants. 
We performed a functional assay, the mHam, and targeted genetic sequencing in all groups.
RESULTS. Significantly more participants with rare germline mutations in APC genes were present 
in the HELLP cohort compared with controls (46% versus 8%, P = 0.01). In addition, significantly 
more HELLP participants were positive for the mHam when compared with controls (62% versus 
16%, P = 0.009). Testing positive for both a germline mutation and the mHam was highly predictive 
for the diagnosis of HELLP syndrome.
CONCLUSION. HELLP syndrome is characterized by both activation of the APC and frequent 
germline mutations in APC genes. Similar to aHUS, treatment via complement inhibition to 
mitigate maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality may be possible.

CLINICAL MEDICINE
Complement plays a crucial role in host immunity secondary to the opsonization of pathogens, 
the recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells, and the initiation of membrane attack complexes 
(MACs) (9, 10). It consists of an enzymatic cascade of over 30 proteins that are activated by the classi￾cal pathway, the lectin pathway, and the alternative pathway (9). While the classical pathway depends on 
antigen-antibody complexes (e.g., lupus) for activation, the alternative pathway of complement (APC) is 
antibody independent and has various triggers including infection, trauma, and pregnancy (11). In disease 
states, dysregulation of the APC is frequently secondary to inactivation of regulatory proteins, resulting in 
amplification loops that increase proinflammatory cytokines and activation of C3 and C5, leading to an 
increase in formation of MACs and subsequent endothelial damage.
Although integral in host survival, the overactivation of complement can cause highly morbid dis￾eases, exemplified by atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). aHUS is caused by APC dysregula￾tion and presents with signs of thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, acute kidney injury, hypertension, 
and neurologic abnormalities, a clinical presentation phenotypically similar to HELLP syndrome (12, 13). 
Heterozygous germline mutations in genes that function in the APC are found in approximately 50% of 
aHUS patients, leading to loss of function of complement inhibitors or occasionally gain of function in 
complement activators. Mutations in APC genes have also been identified in small cohorts of patients with 
preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome (14–21). While genetic alterations confer susceptibility to disease in 
aHUS, an additional risk factor, or trigger, is required for disease onset (12). Importantly, treatment with 
terminal complement inhibitors such as eculizumab are effective in treating aHUS (22).
Previously, we assessed activation of the APC in patients with HELLP syndrome using the modi￾fied Ham (mHam) test (13). This assay measures the ability of a patient’s serum to induce death of cells 
sensitive to complement activity due to a lack of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-modified (GPI-modified) 
proteins. Without GPI, the cells cannot anchor crucial complement regulator proteins of the APC to their 
membrane, such as CD55 and CD59, and are unable to regulate complement activation (20). Thus, the 
mHam is a functional assay that can be used to delineate diseases of APC dysregulation, and has been vali￾dated in its ability to distinguish aHUS from thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs) that have similar clini￾cal presentations but differ in pathophysiology (13, 20). We previously reported that like aHUS, a majority 
of HELLP syndrome patients display dysregulation of the APC in their serum, evidenced by increased cell 
killing in the mHam assay (13).
Based on our data, we hypothesized that HELLP syndrome follows a 2-hit disease model similar to 
aHUS, requiring both a germline susceptibility mutation as well as an environmental risk factor (pregnan￾cy). Here, we show that the APC is more likely to be active in the serum of patients with HELLP syndrome 
compared with healthy pregnant females. In addition, we find that patients with HELLP syndrome harbor 
germline mutations in APC genes at a similar prevalence to that seen in aHUS. We envision this informa￾tion to be useful in identifying women that have APC dysregulation that may respond to complement 
inhibition, much like other diseases of the APC.
Results
Participant demographics. To test our hypothesis, women with HELLP syndrome, partial HELLP syndrome, 
and healthy pregnant controls were recruited from 2015 to 2016. Our cohort consisted of 13 participants 
with HELLP syndrome (H1–H13, Table 1), 14 participants with partial HELLP syndrome (PH1–PH14, 
Table 2), and 19 healthy pregnant controls (HPC1–HPC19, Table 3). In order to compare these cohorts to 
patients with TMA, we also recruited 18 participants diagnosed with aHUS (aHUS1–aHUS18, Table 4), 
and 8 participants diagnosed with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP1–TTP8, Table 4). The par￾ticipant demographics among HELLP, partial HELLP, and HPC cohorts did not differ in body mass index 
(BMI), race, or parity. However, the HELLP group had a statistically significant younger age when com￾pared with the HPC group (27 versus 32 years, P < 0.030), but not when compared with partial HELLP 
syndrome. We also found that the mean estimated gestational age (EGA) of HELLP participants was 
significantly younger compared with the HPC group (30 versus 37 weeks, P < 0.001).
HELLP participants had a significantly greater incidence of adverse maternal and/or fetal events com￾pared with both partial HELLP and HPC groups. Of the HELLP group participants, 7 of 13 (54%) had 
adverse maternal events. One woman was admitted to the intensive care unit and required renal replace￾ment therapy for acute renal failure. Seven women needed blood product transfusions, and one partici￾pant had an eclamptic seizure. In addition, 7 of 13 women (54%) had adverse fetal events in the HELLP

syndrome group. Three participants terminated their pregnancies secondary to the diagnosis of HELLP 
syndrome in the setting of a nonviable fetus (less than 23 weeks and/or estimated fetal weight less than 
500 grams). The other 5 fetuses survived but were diagnosed with fetal growth restriction (FGR), which 
manifested in the third trimester.
There was one adverse maternal outcome in the partial HELLP group, which was an eclamptic sei￾zure. Further, 4 of 14 participants (29%) experienced the adverse fetal event of FGR. There were no fetal 
terminations in the partial HELLP group. In our HPC cohort, there was one participant who was later 
diagnosed with preeclampsia (not HELLP or partial HELLP syndrome). At the time of recruitment, the 
participant was normotensive without signs or symptoms of preeclampsia and had an EGA of 38 weeks. 
She was diagnosed with preeclampsia at 39 weeks and 5 days and this necessitated induction of labor. 
There was one adverse fetal outcome, which was FGR in the HPC group. All HELLP or partial HELLP 
syndrome resolved postpartum or after termination in all cases, and no cases of pregnancy-associated 
aHUS or TTP were observed.
Complement activation in HELLP and aHUS. The mHam assay was performed for all participants with 
available serum samples in order to assess activation of the APC. A positive test is defined as greater than 
20.5% cell killing, based on our previous study suggesting that HELLP patients are positive in the mHam 
assay (13). In this analysis, 8 of 13 HELLP participants (62%) were positive, compared with only 2 of 18 
participants (11%) in the HPC group (Figure 1). In addition, only 3 of 14 (21%) partial HELLP participants 
were positive in the mHam assay. For participants with aHUS, 15 of 17 (88%) were positive, while only 1 of 
7 participants (14%) with TTP were positive, confirming as expected that the mHam is a useful discrimina￾tor between these 2 phenotypes (20).
While the mHam assesses complement activation as a measure of relative cell death, the magnitude 
of a result above the 20.5% threshold has unclear significance and has not been found to be associated 
with clinical outcomes. Thus, statistical analysis was performed using the mHam as a binary measure 
(positive or negative). When compared with the HPC group, HELLP syndrome participants were signifi￾cantly more likely to test positive for the mHam assay (62% versus 11%, P = 0.006) (Table 5). We also

generated a control cohort for a TMA during pregnancy by combining the HPC and TTP groups, as both 
are expected to have normal complement regulation, and the TTP participants are a confirmed negative 
control in our previous study (20). HELLP participants were significantly more likely to test positive in the 
mHam assay (62% versus 16%, P = 0.009) compared with the composite control cohort. This was also true 
for aHUS patients compared with this cohort (88% versus 16%, P < 0.001). Conversely, mHam positivity in 
the HELLP syndrome and aHUS groups was not significantly different. These data indicate that HELLP 
syndrome, similar to aHUS, is marked by activation of complement.
Identification of rare germline variants in HELLP syndrome. Approximately 50% of aHUS patients harbor 
germline mutations in genes that regulate the APC; thus, we performed targeted sequencing of participant 
DNA to identify germline variants in 9 genes known to have a functional role in the APC. To minimize the 
contribution of likely benign germline polymorphisms, only rare heterozygous germline variants with a minor 
allele frequency less than 0.01 (1%) were included in our analysis (detailed in methods). In addition, homozy￾gous deletion of CFHR1 and CFHR3, reported to occur in approximately 2% of the population, was included 
in our analysis owing to its association with aHUS and likely functional significance (21). In our pregnant 
cohorts, 2 participants in the HELLP syndrome group and 2 participants in the HPC group did not give con￾sent for gene mutation testing. We identified a rare germline variant or homozygous deletion in 5 of 11 HELLP 
participants (46%), compared with only 3 of 14 partial HELLP participants (21%), and 2 of 17 participants 
(12%) in the HPC group (Tables 1–3 and Figure 2). Further, in our TMA cohorts, germline variants were found 
in 10 of 18 participants with aHUS (56%), while no variants were identified any of the 8 TTP participants 
(Table 4). When compared with the HPC group alone, there was a nonsignificant trend towards the presence 
of a genetic variant in the HELLP syndrome cohort (46% versus 12%, P = 0.07). When compared with the 
composite controls (combined HPC and TTP groups), HELLP patients were significantly more likely to have a 
rare germline variant in an APC gene (46% versus 8%, P = 0.01). In addition, there was no difference between 
the HELLP syndrome and aHUS cohorts for the presence of a genetic variant (Table 6).

Detailed characteristics of all identified genetic variants, along with pathogenicity prediction outcomes 
for single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) via 3 different algorithms, are provided in Table 7. There were 2 
HELLP participants with frameshift mutations, assumed to be loss of function, and 1 participant with a 
missense mutation predicted to be pathogenic in 2 out of 3 algorithms. Each of these participants also had a 
positive mHam test. Another HELLP participant with a positive mHam test harbored a homozygous dele￾tion of the CFHR1 gene. There was one HELLP participant with a negative mHam assay and a germline 
variant. This individual (H5) was found to have homozygous deletion of both CFHR1 and CFHR3 and car￾ried a history of HELLP syndrome in a prior pregnancy. Interestingly, homozygous deletion of CFHR1 and 
CFHR3 was found in 3 participants with partial HELLP, all with negative mHam tests. One of these partici￾pants (PH1) also had a history of HELLP syndrome in a prior pregnancy. Of note, PH1 was found to have 2 
additional missense variants in other APC genes as well. There were 2 HPC participants identified with rare 
genetic variants, both negative in the mHam assay. One individual (HPC1) carried a diagnosis of sickle cell 
trait and α-thalassemia and harbored multiple missense mutations, with one predicted to be pathogenic by 
all 3 algorithms. By comparison, all aHUS participants with identified germline variants were also found to 
be positive in the mHam assay. Two participants were found to have deletions of both CFHR1 and CFHR3, 
while 1 participant harbored a deletion of CFHR1 only. Deletion of CFHR genes were not identified in any 
HPC or TTP participants, supporting the functional significance of this variant. However, this variant by 
itself does not appear to sufficiently activate the APC in order to produce a positive mHam test.
Discussion
In this study, we demonstrate that HELLP syndrome is part of the phenome that results from germline muta￾tions in genes that regulate the APC. Using phenotypic, functional (mHam assay demonstrating impaired 
complement regulation), and genetic (mutations in genes that regulate the APC) data we found striking 
similarities to aHUS. Our genetic analysis was limited to rare germline variants in order to increase the likeli￾hood of identifying pathogenic mutations that alter the function of APC genes. Using this strict criterion, 
significantly more APC germline mutations were identified in the HELLP syndrome cohort compared with

controls (46% versus 8%, P = 0.01), while no difference was found when compared with aHUS. We also 
confirmed our previous data demonstrating that significantly more HELLP participants test positive in the 
mHam assay compared with controls (62% versus 16%, P = 0.009). Further, we did not identify any individ￾uals in our control groups that tested positive for both the mHam assay and a germline variant (0 of 23 HPC 
and TTP participants, compared with 4 of 11 HELLP participants). Conversely, both tests were negative in 
17 of 23 control participants and only 2 of 11 HELLP participants. Thus, this combination of testing may 
identify individuals with HELLP syndrome who could potentially benefit from therapeutic intervention.
Our findings agree with previous studies suggesting that complement plays an important role in the 
pathophysiology of HELLP. The APC activation fragment Bb was found to be a predictor of acquiring pre￾eclampsia (23). In addition, a prospective study of 40 pregnant women with lupus and/or antiphospholipid 
antibodies who developed preeclampsia identified 7 (17.5%) that had germline heterozygous mutations 
likely to be deleterious in MCP, CFI, or CFH (14). Other studies have performed targeted sequencing of 
various APC genes in patients with HELLP syndrome and identified heterozygous mutations in 9% to 36% 
of cases (18, 19).
The major limitation of this study is the small sample sizes of the participant groups. Further, mul￾tiple HELLP and partial HELLP participants tested negative for APC activation in the mHam assay. 
The most likely explanation for this finding is that the pathophysiology of HELLP syndrome (and par￾tial HELLP even more so) is due to multiple factors. However, this study builds on our previous data 
and that of others demonstrating that a significant subset of HELLP syndrome is due to a reduced 
ability to regulate the APC, analogous to aHUS (13, 18, 20). Indeed, the clinical manifestations of 
hypertension, renal insufficiency, thrombocytopenia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, elevated aspar￾tate aminotransferase, and even the presence of schistocytes are common to both disorders. Roughly 
50% of aHUS patients harbor germline mutations, usually heterozygous, that increase susceptibility 
of endothelial cells to injury from activated complement (12, 15, 16). These patients are often asymp￾tomatic for decades until they encounter a strong complement trigger such as major surgery, infection, 
malignancy, autoimmunity, or pregnancy. In HELLP syndrome, pregnancy is the likely trigger (11). 
Previous studies have shown that complement proteins such as CFH and C5b-9, as well as associated 
contributors of increased complement (e.g., C-reactive protein) are significantly increased during preg￾nancy, possibly explaining why phenotypic manifestations of HELLP syndrome almost exclusively 
occur in the late second or third trimester (9, 24–27). This may also explain why 2 cases in the HPC 
cohort tested positive in the mHam assay.

In our cohort, HELLP syndrome participants were associated with more frequent adverse maternal and 
fetal outcomes compared with the partial HELLP syndrome or HPC participants. Women with HELLP syn￾drome are more likely to have increased morbidity and mortality secondary to disseminated intravascular 
coagulation and hepatic rupture compared with other hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (28, 29). However, 
6 of the 7 women with HELLP syndrome who had maternal adverse events were either positive by the mHam 
assay or had a rare variant in an APC gene. Our data suggest that the increased morbidity or mortality in 
HELLP syndrome is associated with dysregulation of the APC. In the partial HELLP group, there was only 
one participant (PH6) with an adverse maternal outcome (an eclamptic seizure); she was also positive in the

mHam, indicating increased APC activation. There was one participant in the HPC group with a negative 
mHam and genetic analysis who was later diagnosed with preeclampsia.
In the HELLP group there were 7 participants who had adverse fetal outcomes, 3 of which were 
terminations of pregnancy secondary to early gestational age and fetal weight less than 500 grams at 
time of diagnosis. Two of these had either a positive mHam or a rare germline variant. In the partial 
HELLP group there were 4 participants with adverse fetal outcomes, all of whom had either a positive 
mHam test or a rare germline variant, further indicating that abnormal complement regulation is asso￾ciated with both poor maternal and fetal outcomes. There were 2 HPC participants with positive mHam 
assays, potentially secondary to the normal upregulation of the complement system during pregnancy, 
particularly in the third trimester (9). Further, there were 2 HPC participants with rare variants of the 
APC. Similar to multiple other genetic diseases (hemochromatosis, for example), rare variants of the 
APC are associated with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity (30–35). Therefore, genetic

variants are best characterized as risk factors, with disease onset occurring in the setting of additional 
environmental stress causing complement activation.
Our findings have important clinical implications for the diagnosis and treatment of HELLP syn￾drome. Reliable biomarkers and genetic mutations that predispose to disease states are critical for 
planning future clinical trials and for targeted approaches to therapy. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemo￾globinuria (PNH) and aHUS are diseases caused by mutations that predispose cells to complement￾mediated destruction (16, 36–38). Both of these conditions are dramatically and rapidly improved by 
blocking terminal complement with the humanized monoclonal antibody, eculizumab (22, 39–41). 
Prior to FDA approval of eculizumab, pregnancy was relatively contraindicated in PNH due to exces￾sive complement activation that increased fetal and maternal mortality. Eculizumab is now routinely 
recommended for PNH patients who become pregnant since the drug does not effectively cross the 
placenta or enter the breast milk (42). Complement inhibition has also greatly improved the outcome 
of patients with aHUS. Recent studies in aHUS show that this treatment can be safely discontinued 
in most patients once a complete remission is achieved and the complement trigger has resolved (43). 
Our study confirms that aHUS and HELLP share similar pathophysiology. Indeed, there is a case 
report of eculizumab treatment leading to clinical improvement and prolongation of pregnancy in 
a patient with HELLP syndrome (44). Furthermore, we previously demonstrated that C5 inhibition 
can effectively block complement-mediated killing in HELLP serum in vitro (13). Currently, HELLP 
syndrome is most effectively managed by delivering the fetus (removal of the complement trigger); 
however, in cases of early gestational age (before 28 weeks) there is a high risk of fetal mortality and 
maternal morbidity (1). Based on our data and those of others, we suggest that future trials of comple￾ment inhibition in HELLP syndrome include genetic testing and the mHam assay to firmly establish 
the diagnosis. Patients with HELLP syndrome diagnosed prior to 28 weeks gestational age may benefit 
from this therapeutic intervention to allow the fetus to reach a safer gestational age and achieve less 
neonatal morbidity.
In summary, most HELLP syndrome and likely some preeclampsia, is driven by failure to regulate 
the APC. Serologic assays demonstrating a reduced ability to regulate complement (mHam), germline 
mutations in genes that regulate the APC, or both, are found in a majority of patients with HELLP 
syndrome. While we do not advocate for off-label use of complement inhibitors in HELLP syndrome, 
our findings form the basis for the design of clinical trials to test the efficacy of complement inhibition 
to reduce perinatal morbidity from early prematurity.

Methods
Study population and design. We performed a prospective case-controlled study to identify whether 
HELLP syndrome is associated with both activation of the APC as well as germline variants in genes 
that regulate the APC. We hypothesized that HELLP syndrome patients harboring genetic variants of 
APC genes would also display activation of the APC via a functional assay (the mHam). All partici￾pants were recruited from the Johns Hopkins Medical Institute, and none had been studied previously. 
The Tennessee criteria were used for the diagnosis of HELLP syndrome, and partial HELLP syndrome 
was defined by having 1 or 2 but not all lab abnormalities of HELLP syndrome (Supplemental Table 1; 
supplemental material available online with this article; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.99128DS1) 
(1, 45). We recruited all participants from November 1, 2015 to December 31, 2016. Healthy pregnant 
controls were recruited after 23 weeks of gestation, and were excluded if they had a history of hyper￾tensive disease, complement or microangiopathic disorder, or autoimmune disease. Blood was collected 
from all participants at the time of recruitment by venipuncture of the antecubital vein. Serum was cold 
centrifuged within 2 hours of collection at 4°C and stored at –80°C. Whole blood was used to generate 
genomic DNA for targeted gene sequencing using a Qiagen DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit. All samples 
were deidentified and coded prior to laboratory testing. Patients with aHUS were recruited using stan￾dard diagnostic criteria defined by Legendre et al. (39). Patients with TTP were recruited following 
confirmation of the diagnosis via an ADAMTS13 activity less than 10%.

mHam assay. The mHam assay was performed as previously described (20). Briefly, PNH-like 
(PIGA–null) TF-1 cells were used to assess complement-mediated killing via the APC. Cells were plat￾ed in U-shaped wells at a density at 4,000 cells/well and incubated in 20% serum with Gelatin Veronal 
Buffer (GVB, Complement Technology, Inc). Each sample was tested in triplicate for 30 minutes at 
37°C. After incubation, the supernatant was removed and cell proliferation agent WST-1 (Roche) was 
added and incubated for 2 hours at 37°C. Absorbance was measured in an iMark Microplate Absor￾bance Reader (Bio-Rad) at 490 nm with a reference wave length at 595 nm. Heat-inactivated serum was 
used as a negative control for each sample. Heat inactivation was performed by incubating the serum at 
56°C for 30 minutes. Normal human AB serum (H4522, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as an internal control 
in the assay. The percentage of live cells was calculated as the ratio of the absorbance of each sample 
divided by the absorbance of the same sample’s heat-inactivated control. The percentage of nonviable 
cells (cell killing) was calculated as 1 minus this ratio.
Targeted sequencing. A custom panel of 9 genes known to function in the APC was selected for 
sequencing using the Illumina TruSeq Custom Amplicon (v1.5). Illumina DesignStudio software was 
utilized to generate custom oligonucleotides designed to amplify exonic regions of the following selected 
genes: CFH, CFB, CFI, CFHR1, CFHR3, CFHR5, C3, CD46 (MCP), and THBD. The panel consisted of 
402 amplicons covering a total of 58.3 kb with an overall coverage of 98%. An amplicon library of each 
patient sample was generated according to the manufacturer’s protocol using 250 ng genomic DNA as 
input. Successful library amplification was verified for a subset of samples by both gel electrophoresis 
and Bioanalyzer (Agilent) analysis. This was followed by library normalization and pooling per manu￾facturer protocol, and paired-end sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform via the Genetic Resources 
Core Facility (GRCF) at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine (https://grcf.jhmi.edu). Analysis of raw 
sequencing data (FASTQ) was performed using the TruSeq Amplicon application (v2.0.0) via the Illu￾mina BaseSpace platform, aligning to (GRCh37/hg19) human genome reference. Average base coverage 
was 377× per sample. SNVs and small indels were identified using Isaac variant caller and variant call 
files were filtered using VariantStudio software (v3.0). Variants not passing Illumina’s variant quality 
filters were excluded. The following criteria were used to identify rare germline SNVs and indels: non￾synonymous coding region variants with a depth greater than 20×, variant allele frequency between 
40% and 60%, Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC v0.3.1) minor allele frequency less than 0.01 in 
any ethnic population (total of 60,706 samples), and minor allele frequency less than 0.01 in the Exome 
Variant Server (46). Large deletions were determined by complete loss of signal for multiple consecutive 
amplicons (Supplemental Figure 1). All genomic coordinates refer to hg19.
Adverse events. The investigators sought to observe any adverse maternal or fetal events in the HELLP 
group, partial HELLP group, and HPC group. Maternal adverse events were maternal mortality, inten￾sive care unit admission, renal failure, blood product transfusion, and eclampsia in HELLP or partial 
HELLP groups, or new diagnosis of preeclampsia in a control group. Fetal adverse events were fetal ter￾mination or abortion secondary to diagnosis of HELLP or partial HELLP syndrome, neonatal mortality, 
and fetal growth restriction. Other than worsening of HELLP syndrome in the setting of a nonviable 
fetus, no other factors were relevant for fetal terminations. Because neonatal intensive care unit admis￾sion in preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome is usually secondary to iatrogenic preterm birth, we did not 
include this as an adverse event in our group.
Statistics. A 1-way ANOVA test with Bonferroni’s correction was used to calculate the P values for 
the difference among the means for age, BMI, estimated gestational age in HELLP, partial HELLP, 
and the HPC groups. Either χ2
 test or Fisher’s exact test was used to calculate the rest of the P values 
provided. A Fisher’s exact was used if more than 20% of the expected values in the input cells were 
less than 5 and/or any individual values had expected counts of less than 1. Statistical significance 
for the mHam assay was calculated as a binary value (positive or negative), as the mHam assay is 
thought to be clinically significant as a qualitative test. All analyses were performed by using SPSS 18 
for Windows/MAC (PASW Statistics GradPack 18; SPSS). All tests were 2-sided with P less than 0.05 
indicating significance.
Study approval. This study was approved by the Johns Hopkins institutional review board and con￾ducted according to Declaration of Helsinki principles. Written informed consent was received from all 
participants prior to inclusion in the study.
