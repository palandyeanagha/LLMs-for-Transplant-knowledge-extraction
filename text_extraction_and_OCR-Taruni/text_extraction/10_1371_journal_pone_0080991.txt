Abstract
Objectives: No extensive investigation has been performed and thus no representative data are available regarding
acute liver failure (ALF) in China. This study aims to investigate the causes and outcomes of ALF in China and
establish a prognostic model.
Methods: Patients diagnosed as ALF in seven hospitals in different areas of China from January 2007 to December
2012 were retrospectively selected.
Results: Of the 177 patients included in this study, 112 (63.28%) eventually died. The common causes of ALF were
drug toxicity (43.50%), indeterminate etiology (29.38%) and acute viral hepatitis (11.30%). Additionally, traditional
Chinese herbs predominated in the causes of drug-induced ALF (30/77). No patients in this study received liver
transplantation. In the established model for predicting death in ALF, four variables were finally selected out,
including age (P=0.01), the entry hepatic encephalopathy grade (P=0.04), international normalized ratio (P<0.01) and
arterial blood ammonia (P=0.02). Using a threshold value of 0.5683, this model had a sensitivity of 95.24% and a
specificity of 91.30%.
Conclusions: Traditional Chinese medicine was a major cause of ALF in China. The spontaneous mortality of ALF
was high, whereas the rate of liver transplantation was significantly low. The established prognostic model of ALF
had superior sensitivity and specificity.

Introduction
Acute liver failure (ALF) is a complex condition characterized
by rapid deterioration of liver function in a patient without
previously recognized liver disease. In spite of the
improvement of artificial liver support system and advancement
in liver transplantation, the overall mortality of ALF remains
20%-40% [1], the major reasons of which are the rapid disease
progression and the highly unpredictable outcomes depending
on various factors. Based on previous reports, patients with
ALF had greatly variant outcomes according to the causes that
also varied markedly by geographical region [2-4]. So, it is
important and necessary to do studies on the etiology and
prediction for outcome of ALF in different cohorts [5].
Because of its rarity, studies on ALF are relatively fewer, and
moreover, discrepancies in the definitions of ALF hinder in￾depth worldwide studies. It is reported that more than 40
definitions exit among different countries or regions and the
diversity in ALF definitions becomes the obstacle to
comparability and quantitative analysis among studies [6]. In
China, though liver disease is a major public health concern
and viral hepatitis B is especially prevalent [7], the national
diagnostic and treatment guidelines for liver failure were issued
by Chinese Society of Hepatology in late 2006 [8]. From then
on, the diagnosis of ALF began to arrive at uniformity and
studies in this field became standardized in China, but the
available data on ALF in Chinese population has been still rare
up to date. In this study, we performed an extensive
investigation including 177 patients diagnosed as ALF after
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 November 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 11 | e80991

January 2007, with the intentions of investigating the causes
and mortality and establishing a prognostic model based on
Chinese patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
report on a multi-center study of ALF in Chinese population.
Patients and Methods
Patient Collection
ALF in this study was defined as coagulopathy (prothrombin
activity (PTA)≤40% or international normalized ratio (INR)≥1.5),
jaundice (serum total bilirubin (TBil) ≥171 μmol/L or a daily
increase ≥17.1 μmol/L) and encephalopathy (any degree of
altered mentation) within 4 weeks in a patient without pre￾existing liver diseases. Patients older than 12 years eligible for
the above diagnostic criteria from January 2007 to December
2012 were included in this study. To ensure the
representativeness and comparability of the data, we selected
seven tertiary military hospitals in different areas of China:
Beijing 302 Hospital (located in Beijing, North China), General
Hospital of PLA (located in Beijing, North China), Changhai
Hospital Affiliated to Second Military Medical University
(located in Shanghai, East China), PLA 161 Hospital (located in
Wuhan, Hubei Province, South China), PLA 477 Hospital
((located in Wuhan, Hubei Province, South China), General
Hospital of Jinan Military Region (located in Jinan, Shandong
Province, East China) and General Hospital of Lanzhou Military
Region (located in Lanzhou, Gansu Province, West China).
Figure 1 shows the enrollment of patients in our study.
Ethics Statement
The study was performed in accordance with the ethical
guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki and was
approved by the ethics committees of each hospital. Informed
written or verbal consent was obtained from the patient or the
next of kin.
Data Extraction and Assessment
The following variables were obtained from the electronic
medical records and follow-up documents: cause, outcome,
sex, age, grade of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) on admission,
time from onset of illness to the development of HE, white
blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, PTA, INR, serum
alanine aminotransferase (ALT), serum aspartate
aminotransferase (AST), serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP),
serum cholinesterase, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH),
serum TBil, serum albumin, serum creatinine, serum urea
nitrogen, serum glucose, serum Na+
, serum K+
, serum Cl-
,
arterial blood ammonia (BLA), arterial blood lactate and arterial
blood pH. Grade of HE had been determined in the medical
records according to the following criteria: I. loss of sleep
rhythm, anxiousness, confusion or flapping tremors; II. loss of
sphincter control, drowsiness or behavioral disorder; III.
persistent coma, but still responding to shouts; IV. deep coma
with no consciousness.
Statistical Analysis
Data analyses were performed using SAS 9.2 software (SAS
Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Continuous data were
expressed as median (inter-quartile range) or mean±standard
deviation. Categorical data were expressed as the number of
subjects. Group comparisons were performed using the
Wilcoxon rank sum test or t test for continuous variables, and
Chi-square test for categorical variables. Logistic regression
was used for evaluating prognostic predictors of ALF. Receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used for
assessing prognostic accuracy of the outcome prediction
model. Tests were two-sided and a probability (P) value of less
than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

177 patients were totally included in this study. Of these
patients, 77 (43.50%) developed ALF caused by drug toxicity,
52 (29.38%) had ALF of indeterminate cause, 20 (11.30%) had
acute viral hepatitis and 28 (15.82%) had other causes.
In the patients with ALF induced by drugs, 30 (16.95%) had
received herbal remedies, 21 (11.86%) had ingested
acetaminophen, 11 (6.21%) had used antibiotics, 5 (2.82%)
had received antituberculosis therapy, 5 (2.82%) had received
antineoplastic chemotherapy, 2 (1.13%) had used
phenprocoumon and 3 (1.69%) had ingested other drugs.
In the patients with ALF due to viral hepatitis, 11 (6.21%)
was infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV), 5 (2.82%) with
hepatitis E virus (HEV), 2 (1.13%) with hepatitis A virus (HAV),
1 (0.57%) with cytomegalovirus and 1 (0.57%) with Epstein￾Barr virus.
Other causes of ALF were respectively ischemic hepatitis in
6 (3.39%) patients, extrahepatic malignancy metastasis in 5
(2.82%), alcoholism in 4 (2.26%), severe infection of biliary
tract in 3 (1.69%), poisonous chemical agents in 3 (1.69%),
amanita in 3 (1.69%), pregnancy in 2 (1.13%), Budd-Chiari
syndrome in 1 (0.57%) and heat stroke in 1 (0.57%).
No patients received liver transplantation in this study. In the
177 patients, 65 (36.72%) survived and 112 (63.28%) died.
The distribution of causes and outcomes of ALF is
demonstrated in Figure 2.
Baseline Characteristics on Admission
Table 1 summarizes the baseline characteristics of patients
with ALF on admission according to the outcome (death or
survival). The median age (P=0.03), INR (P<0.01), arterial BLA
(P<0.01) and serum LDH (P<0.01) in patients who died were
significantly higher than those in patients who survived, and
median platelet count (P=0.01) and PTA (P<0.01) in patients
who died were notably lower than those in patients who

Prediction model for the outcome in ALF
Table 2 represents the final model established using logistic
regression. Four variables were eventually selected out to
predict the death of ALF, including age (odds ratio (OR) 1.064,
95% confidence interval (CI) 1.015-1.115, P=0.01), the entry
HE grade (II vs. ≤II, OR 7.459, 95% CI 1.024-54.327, P=0.04),
INR (OR 10.019, 95% CI 2.530-39.677, P<0.01) and arterial
BLA (OR 1.035, 95% CI 1.004-1.067, P=0.02). Using a
threshold value of 0.5683, this model had a sensitivity of
95.24%, a specificity of 91.30% and an accuracy of 93.85%.
Figure 3 shows the ROC curve analysis for predictive power of
this model (the area under the ROC curve 0.9757, 95% CI
0.9540-0.9973).
Discussion
The etiology of ALF showed worldwide variation [9]. Some
previous studies reported that synthetic pharmaceuticals (e.g.
acetaminophen and phenprocoumon) were the most common
cause of ALF in the United States and Europe, while in the
Mediterranean region, around 40% of cases with ALF are
caused by hepatotropic viruses, most frequently by HBV [2-4].
According to our investigation, the most frequent etiology of
ALF in China were drugs, which was in accordance with other
reports from western developed countries [2,3,10,11].
However, unlike the overwhelming majority of ALF induced by
acetaminophen in western countries, traditional Chinese herbs
dominated in the causes in China. So, doctors should pay more
attention to the patient’s past medical history on herbal remedy
when identifying the etiology of ALF.
Acetaminophen was a well-recognized hepatotoxin [12]. In
this study, it was responsible for 11.86% of cases, which was
much lower than other reports from the United States and
Europe [2,3,10,11]. Unlike the description by Bernal W [13],
viral causes of ALF did not predominate in this investigation
from China, a developing country, and moreover, acute
hepatitis B infection rather than hepatitis E infection, was the
main viral cause. In addition to drug-toxicity, indeterminate and
viral causes of ALF, 28 (15.82%) cases are classified as other
causes, including ischemic hepatitis, extrahepatic malignancy
metastasis, alcoholism, etc. Emphatically, ischemic hepatitis

was a rare etiology of ALF in China, while it was a common
cause of ALF in Sweden [3].
The spontaneous death rates of ALF were reported to range
from 10% to 90% in different cohorts [3]. The wide difference
was mostly resulted by the discrepancies in the diagnostic
criteria of ALF in various studies. In our study, we set
coagulopathy, jaundice and encephalopathy as mandatory
elements in the definition of ALF. The mortality of ALF without
liver transplantation in our study arrived at 63.28%.
Liver transplantation remained the only treatment option in
ALF when standard medical therapy failed [14]. In western
developed countries, rates of transplant ranged from 25% to
30% in patients with ALF [15], but based on our study, the rate
was as low as 0% in China. The reasons for this included the
difficulties in obtaining organs in urgent fashion, as well as the
economic situation of patients in China. Under such a
circumstance, it was critically important to determine the
prognosis in ALF as early as possible [16]. With the aim of
ensuring the timeliness and practicality of the forecasting
model, we used the entry variables rather than the peak ones
to predict the outcomes of ALF because it was somewhat late
to make further vital decisions when peak value had been
reached.
As of now, there have been various prognostic scoring
systems applied for predicting outcomes of ALF, including the
King’s college hospital criteria, the model for end-stage liver
disease score, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation
II score and the Clichy criteria [17-19], however, to our
knowledge, no prediction model based on Chinese patients
with ALF has been established. In this study, the results
showed that four common, easily-measured prognostic factors
in combination could predict the death in ALF with an accuracy
of 93.85%, which were age, the entry HE grade, INR and
arterial BLA, and the likelihood of death increased with the
levels of the four variables increasing. According to the area
under the ROC curve (0.9757), this model also had good
discrimination.
The limitation of our research was that we did not set an
external validation cohort to verify the established prognostic
model.

In conclusion, traditional Chinese medicine was a major
cause of ALF in China. The spontaneous mortality of ALF was
high, whereas the rate of liver transplantation was significantly
low. The established prognostic model of ALF had early
applicability and superior sensitivity and specificity.
