Complement activation is largely implicated in the pathogenesis of several clinical con￾ditions and its therapeutic neutralization has proven effective in preventing tissue and 
organ damage. A problem that still needs to be solved in the therapeutic control of 
complement-mediated diseases is how to avoid side effects associated with chronic 
neutralization of the complement system, in particular, the increased risk of infections. 
We addressed this issue developing a strategy based on the preferential delivery of a C5 
complement inhibitor to the organ involved in the pathologic process. To this end, we 
generated Ergidina, a neutralizing recombinant anti-C5 human antibody coupled with 
a cyclic-RGD peptide, with a distinctive homing property for ischemic endothelial cells 
and effective in controlling tissue damage in a rat model of renal ischemia/reperfusion 
injury (IRI). As a result of its preferential localization on renal endothelium, the molecule 
induced complete inhibition of complement activation at tissue level, and local protection 
from complement-mediated tissue damage without affecting circulating C5. The ex vivo
binding of Ergidina to surgically removed kidney exposed to cold ischemia supports its 
therapeutic use to prevent posttransplant IRI leading to delay of graft function. Moreover, 
the finding that the ex vivo binding of Ergidina was not restricted to the kidney, but was 
also seen on ischemic heart, suggests that this RGD-targeted anti-C5 antibody may 
represent a useful tool to treat organs prior to transplantation. Based on this evidence, 
we propose preliminary data showing that Ergidina is a novel targeted drug to prevent 
complement activation on the endothelium of ischemic kidney.

INTRODUCTION
The complement (C) system is an important humoral effector of innate immunity and is widely 
distributed in the circulation and at extravascular sites where it often provides the first line of 
defense against invading pathogens (1). C also plays a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis by 
contributing to clear apoptotic and necrotic cells, to remove immune complexes and to modulate

adaptive immune responses (2). These functions are usually 
fulfilled by biologically active products released as a result of 
C activation that act promoting opsonization, inflammation, 
and direct cell cytotoxicity. The effector molecules or com￾plexes, however, are not selective for the targets to neutralize, 
whether foreign or altered self, and may easily diffuse out into 
surrounding tissues and attack bystander cells. Under normal 
circumstances, undesired effects of the C system are prevented 
by soluble and cell-bound regulators that inhibit its activation 
at various steps of the C sequence (1). Unrestrictive C activation 
is the result of either over-activation due to excessive amount of 
triggering factors or the consequence of defective or dysregula￾tion of C regulatory proteins. Several pathological conditions, 
including autoimmune diseases and more generally inflam￾matory disorders, are associated with C activation leading to 
the release of biologically active products, which can cause 
extensive tissue destruction.
Different therapeutic strategies have been developed to 
prevent C-mediated cell and tissue damage using neutralizing 
antibodies or peptides. The only approved therapeutic mol￾ecules are the plasma-derived C1 inhibitor, indicated for the 
treatment of hereditary angioedema (3), and the C5-blocking 
antibody eculizumab (Soliris), currently used to treat patients 
with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) (4) and 
atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) (5). Other soluble 
inhibitors under development are Mubodina, a neutralizing 
miniantibody against C5 (6), compstatin and its analogs, pep￾tides preventing C3 activation through the alternative pathway 
(7), mirococept, CR1 CCP1–3 fused with a membrane-targeting 
amphiphilic peptide (8) and others (see reviews by Ricklin and 
Lambris) (9, 10).
A problem that has not yet been solved in the control of 
C-mediated diseases is how to reduce and possibly avoid the side 
effects, which may be associated with chronic neutralization of 
the C system (11), in particular, the increased risk of common and 
opportunistic infections. Moreover, the high cost of long-term 
treatment of patients with these drugs to prevent C activation 
represents a major limitation to their clinical use.
We sought to solve these problems developing an alternative 
therapeutic approach consisting in the preferential delivery of the 
C inhibitor to the organ involved in the pathologic process. The 
kidney was selected as a target organ to protect from C-mediated 
damage given the broad range of renal diseases caused by 
C dysregulation, including antibody-mediated glomerulopathies, 
thrombotic microangiopathies, progressive kidney diseases, 
and ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) (12). To this purpose, 
we generated a recombinant protein (Ergidina®) obtained by 
fusing a cyclic-RGD peptide to a neutralizing antibody to C5 
(Mubodina®) and tested its protective effect in a rat model of 
renal IRI. C activated through any one of the three pathways 
by danger-associated molecular patterns, neo-antigens, and 
immune complexes (13) is actively involved in IRI, inducing 
C-mediated cell lysis and tubule-interstitial injury (14), and C3a 
and C5a-dependent inflammatory response (15).
We now present data showing that Ergidina has a distinctive 
homing property for renal endothelial cells and is effective in 
controlling tissue damage caused by renal IRI.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Production of Recombinant Proteins
Anti C5 scFv antibody (6) was cloned, using BssH2 and 
NheI restriction sites, into pMB-SV5 vector (16) containing 
human IgG1 Fc region to produce the scFv-Fc molecule called 
Mubodina (ADIENNE Pharma & Biotech). Ergidina was 
generated by replacing SV5 tag with the peptide RGD-4C (17). 
To this end, Mubodina was amplified with the following oligos 
pMBsense CTGCTTACTGGCTTATCG and pMB-RGD-anti 
GGTTTAAGCTTTTAGCCGCAGAAACAATCTCCTCGG 
CAGTCGCAGGCGCCTTTACCCGGGGACAGGGAGAG. 
The first oligo anneals on the vector pMB at the 5′ while the 
second anneals at the end of human CH3 region and introduce 
the RGD-4C sequence and the Hind III restriction site sequence. 
After PCR amplification, the fragments were cut with XbaI an 
Hind III restriction sites and cloned into pMB-SV5 vector. Finally, 
both Moubodina and Ergidina were subcloned into pUCOE (18) 
vector. All clones obtained were confirmed by sequencing.
Purified plasmid DNA was transfected with freestyle max 
reagent (Invitrogen) in CHO-S cells according to a standard 
protocol and the cells were grown in Pro-CHO 5 (Lonza). The 
recombinant scFv-Fcs were purified from cell-conditioned 
medium loaded on Protein A column and eluted with citric 
acid 0.1M pH 3. Fractions containing the recombinant proteins 
were selected by ELISA (6) and checked for purity by SDS￾PAGE (19).
Hemolytic Assay
The hemolytic activity of the classical pathway of the C system 
was evaluated incubating human serum with sensitized sheep 
red blood cells in the presence of different amount of purified 
recombinant antibodies, as previously described (6).
Animals
Male Wistar rats weighing 240–270  g were obtained from a 
colony kept in the animal house at the University of Trieste. Male 
BALB/c mice weighing 20–24  g were purchased from Charles 
River Italy and maintained in our university facilities. The in vivo
experiments were performed in compliance with the guide￾lines of the European (86/609/EEC) and Italian (D.L.116/92) 
laws, were approved by the Italian Ministry of Health and the 
Administration of the University Animal House, in line with 
NIH Guide for the care and use of laboratory animal, in order to 
minimize the number of animals used and their suffering.
Evaluation of Ergidina® Distribution using 
Time-Domain Near-Infrared Optical 
Imaging
Ergidina was labeled with N-hydroxysuccinimmide ester of the 
cyanine 5.5 (Cy5.5. Amersham Biosciences: Fluorolink Cy5.5 
Monofunctional Dye 5-pack) following a previously reported 
procedure (19).
BALB/c mice received 0.05 mg of Ergidina labeled with 1 nmol 
of Cy5.5 in the tail vein. A small-animal time-domain Optix 
MX preclinical NIR-imager (Advanced Research Technologies)

equipped with a pulsed laser diode and a time-correlated single 
photon counting detector was used in this study for the in vivo
and ex vivo evaluation of labeled Ergidina distribution, as previ￾ously detailed (20).
Binding of Ergidina to Ischemic 
Rat Kidney
Wistar rats were first anesthetized with sodium thiobarbital 
(Inactin, Sigma, 80 mg/kg) and then received i.v. 100–150 IU/kg 
of heparin (Ratiopharm, Germany).
The kidneys were excised and stored in ice for 24 or 48 h after 
perfusion with 5  ml of Celsior through a PE20 polyethylene 
catheter (Intramedic Clay-Adams, Sparks, MD, USA) inserted 
into the renal artery to remove blood.
Afterward, two groups of 18 kidneys each were infused with 
1 ml of iso-osmotic physiologic sterile solution containing either 
0.5 or 1 mg of Cy5.5-labeled Ergidina and stored at 4, 10, and 
25°C for either 15 or 30 min. Three kidneys for each experimental 
condition were used and analyzed by time-domain optical imag￾ing before and after washing with 20 ml of Celsior in order to 
quantify the amount of the initially injected and the remaining 
bound Ergidina after washing.
The kidneys were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at 
−80°C. Seven micrometer sections were also examined by confo￾cal microscopy to confirm the data obtain using optical imaging.
Confocal Microscopy
Seven micrometer sections were also analyzed by confocal 
microscopy to confirm data obtained using optical imaging. 
Sections were examined using a Nikon C1-SI confocal micro￾scope (TE-2000U) equipped with a 20× and 60× oil immersion 
lens. Light was delivered to the sample with an 80/20 reflector. 
The system was operated with a pinhole size of one airy disk 
(30  nm). Electronic zoom was kept at minimum values for 
measurements to reduce potential bleaching, collecting series 
of optical images at 2 µm z resolution step size. The unstained 
tissue was visualized using the 488 nm light line of the Argon laser 
and a 515 dichroic mirror with a 30 nm band emission filter was 
used. The Cy5.5 was exited using the 640 nm light coming from 
a diode laser and the fluorescence collected using a 650 long pass 
mirror. All images were acquired in the linear intensity window 
and with no visible saturation points. Representative images are 
z-projection performed using standard deviation algorithm in 
ImageJ software (NIH).
Model of Ischemia/Reperfusion in Rat
Two groups of six male Wistar rats were anesthetized with 
sodium thiobarbital (Inactin; 80  mg/kg) (Sigma) and under￾went unilateral right nephrectomy following Pavone and 
Boonstra surgical procedure (21). After kidney excision, the 
animals were allowed to rest for 24 h, and then housed in meta￾bolic cages for 24 h to collect urine 1 and 4 days after operation. 
Blood samples were drawn and analyzed to check glucose, 
blood cells, kidney, and liver functional parameters. Blood 
pressure was daily monitored using a tail sphygmomanometric 
device (22).
Two weeks after unilateral nephrectomy, all the rats under￾went a second surgical intervention consisting in the exposition 
of left kidneys through a small flank incision and in the occlusion 
of both left renal artery and vein with a non-traumatic clamp 
for 45 min. At the end of the ischemic period, the clamp was 
released and the organ reperfused.
Before inducing ischemia, a PE20 polyethylen catheter 
(Intramedic Clay-Adams, Sparks, MD, USA) was inserted into 
the right femoral artery, gently pushed toward the iliac artery 
and abdominal aorta, and the tip of the catheter was finally 
placed at the origin of the left renal artery. Two groups of eight 
rats received 1 ml of Celsior containing 250 µg of either Ergidina 
or an unrelated miniantibody infused into the renal artery in a 
5 min time.
Following IR procedure, the rats were housed in metabolic 
cages to collect daily excreted urine 1 and 4 days after opera￾tion, and blood samples were also obtained. The animals were 
sacrificed 4 days after surgery, and the kidneys were removed, 
embedded in OCT compound (Miles, Milan, Italy), snap frozen 
in liquid nitrogen, and kept at −80°C until used for immunofluo￾rescence and histologic analysis.
Urinary proteins were analyzed using Bradfor solution 
(Sigma) and the serum creatinine level was quantified by 
Integrated System Dx 880 (Beckman Coulter).
Immunofluorescence Analysis
Ergidina binding to kidney or heart samples was evaluated using 
frozen sections (7 µm) that had been incubated with the antibody 
(10 µg/ml) for 60 min at room temperature followed by FITC￾labeled goat anti-human IgG (Aczon, Monte SanPietro, Bologna, 
Italy).
Tissue deposition of C3 was assessed by incubating frozen 
kidney 7 µm sections with 1:200 goat IgG anti-rat C3 (Cappel, 
ICN Biomedicals, Milan, Italy) for 60 min at room temperature 
followed by FITC-labeled rabbit anti-goat IgG at a 1:200 dilution 
(DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) for additional 60 min at room tem￾perature. A similar approach was used to evaluate the presence of 
C9, using rabbit IgG anti-rat C9 (a kind gift from Prof. P. Morgan, 
Cardiff, UK) at a 1:1,000 dilution, followed by FITC-labeled swine 
anti-rabbit IgG (DAKO) at a 1:40 dilution.
The fluorescence intensity was evaluated in 10 different 
randomly selected areas (0.07 mm2
 each) of renal tissue. ImageJ 
image analysis software (National Institutes of Health) was used.
Histomorphologic Evaluation
The excised kidneys were preserved in phosphate-buffered 10% 
formalin, embedded in paraffin wax, cut into thin sections (7 µm), 
and stained with hematoxylin and eosin.
Histopathological changes were analyzed for tubular necrosis, 
proteinaceous casts, and medullary congestion, as previously 
described (23). Tubular necrosis and extension of proteina￾ceous casts were both graded as follows: no damage (0), mild 
(+1, unicellular, patchy isolated damage), moderate (+2, damage 
less than 25%), severe (+3, damage between 25 and 50%), and 
very severe (+4, more than 50% damage). The degree of medul￾lary congestion was defined as follows: no congestion (0), mild 
(+1, vascular congestion with identification of erythrocytes by

Increasing amounts of recombinant antibodies were mixed with normal 
human serum (1 µl) and incubated for 15 min at room temperature prior to 
addition to 50 µl of sensitized sheep erythrocytes. The serum hemolytic 
activity is presented as mean ± SD of percent values obtained in three 
different experiments.

identification of erythrocytes by +200 magnification), severe 
(+3, vascular congestion with identification of erythrocytes by 
+100 magnification), and very severe (+4, vascular congestion 
with identification of erythrocytes by +40 magnification).
The tissue sections were analyzed in a blind fashion by two 
experienced observers.
Statistical Analysis
The results were expressed as mean ± SD. Data were compared by 
ANOVA using post hoc analysis for paired multiple comparisons 
with Fisher’s corrected t-test. A non-parametric Mann–Whitney 
test was used to determine the significance of differences between 
tissue damage scores in the tested groups.
RESULTS
Production and In Vitro Characterization 
of Ergidina
We designed and cloned a novel recombinant antibody called 
Ergidina containing the neutralizing scFv to C5 (6, 24, 25) fused 
at the C terminal end to the Fc domains of human IgG1 (Hinge￾CH2-CH3) to form Mubodina and the cyclic RGD-4C peptide 
(ACDCRGDCFCG) shown to bind avidly to the integrins αvβ3 
and αvβ5 (26). A schematic picture of the two recombinant mol￾ecules, Mubodina and Ergidina, and the cyclic peptide RGD-4C 
used to generate Ergidina is presented in Figure 1A.
Analysis of Mubodina and Ergidina by SDS-PAGE and western 
blot revealed a major band of the expected size of 115–120 kDa, 
corresponding to the scFv-Fc dimers. Low amounts of monomers 
and degradation products were detected in all preparations of both 
Mubodina and Ergidina (Figure S1A in Supplementary Material). 
Moreover, Ergidina, examined by HPLC using SEC300 size exclu￾sion column (Yarra), was eluted as a single peak corresponding to 
a protein of about 120 kDa (Figure S1B in Supplementary Material). 
Immunoenzymatic analysis showed that both miniantibodies 
were able to bind human C5, but failed to interact with human C3 
(Figure S1C in Supplementary Material). We also tested the ability 
of Ergidina to neutralize C5 and to prevent C activation using a 
standard hemolytic assay. As shown in Figure 1B, Ergidina was 
found to be as efficient as the parent molecule Mubodina in inhibit￾ing serum C hemolytic activity at similar concentration.
In Vivo Distribution of Ergidina
The distribution of the targeted anti-C5 recombinant antibody 
was first examined in healthy mice. The antibody (0.05  mg) 
labeled with 1 nmol Cy5.5 was injected intravenously (i.v.) into 
the tail vein, and its localization was examined by time domain 
optical imaging. Ergidina was diffusely distributed throughout 
the mouse body soon after i.v. administration followed, 6  h 
later, by a preferential accumulation in the kidney peaking at 
24  h (Figure  2A). As already observed with the distribution 
pattern of other Cy5.5-labeled antibodies (19, 27), a proportion 
of the molecule was removed by the liver and the free dye was 
excreted through the kidney, thus explaining the visualization of 
fluorescent signals in the liver and bladder (Figures 2A,B). These 
data were confirmed by ex vivo analysis of the different organs 
performed 6 and 48  h after injection of the labeled molecule 
(Figure 2C). The pharmacokinetic profile of Ergidina was sup￾ported by confocal microscopy analysis of sections of different 
organs removed 6  h after antibody challenging that revealed 
specific near infrared fluorescent staining in the kidney and liver. 
The green fluorescence observed in both these organs was due to 
autofluorescence observed also in the lung that was examined as 
a control organ (Figure S2 in Supplementary Material).
Ex Vivo Binding of Ergidina to 
Ischemic Kidney
To investigate the extent of Ergidina deposition in isolated 
perfused rat kidney under various experimental conditions, 
the organ was removed from healthy animals and either fixed 
immediately or kept in ice for 24 h to mimic ischemic conditions 
prior to fixation in formalin. Tissue sections were then analyzed 
for antibody deposits. As shown in Figure 3A, Ergidina bound 
weakly to the endothelium and more strongly to the tubules of 
normal kidneys. Conversely, glomerular and vessel endothelium 
of ischemic kidney were heavily decorated by RGD-targeted 
antibody under ischemic conditions with levels of fluorescence 
intensity of glomeruli approximately sevenfold higher than that 
observed in control kidney (Figure 3B).

kidney. (A) Representative images from section obtained from healthy or 
ischemic kidneys incubated with Ergidina, followed by FITC-labeled 
anti-human IgG. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI and tissue was

We then tested the capacity of Ergidina to decorate renal 
endothelium of kidneys kept under different ischemic condi￾tions. To this end, 0.5  mg of Cy5.5-labeled Ergidina was 
injected into the renal artery of surgically removed kidneys 
that had been washed and stored at 4°C for 24 h in Celsius®. 
The fluorescence intensity was assessed before and after organ 
perfusion using time-domain optical imaging. As shown in 
supplemental Figure S3, approximately half of the antibody was 
still bound to the renal vessels after incubation for 15 min at 4°C 
followed by perfusion to wash out unbound antibodies. This 
percentage remained essentially unchanged when the incuba￾tion temperature was raised to 10 and 25°C (Figure 4A). The 
binding of RGD-targeted antibody to the vascular endothelium 
of kidney kept at 4°C for 24 h occurred in a short period of time 
reaching a plateau at 15  min (Figure  4B). The percentage of 
bound antibody was slightly increased when the cold ischemia 
time was prolonged from 24 to 48 h. However, the difference 
was not statistically significant (Figure 4C).
The amount of Ergidina bound to the kidney stored at 4°C 
for 24  h was related to the dose of administered antibody and 
increased from 0.26 to 0.48  mg using doses of 0.5 and 1  mg, 
respectively (Figure 4D). The analysis of frozen sections of these 
organs treated with 0.5 mg of cy5.5-labeled Ergidina by confocal 
microscopy showed that the antibody was widely distributed on 
all glomeruli and extraglomerular vessels and was undetectable 
on renal tubules (Figure 5).
To assess whether the binding of Ergidina to surgically 
removed organs was restricted to the kidney, we analyzed

FIGURE 4 | CCharacterization of Ergidina binding to ischemic kidneys. Rat kidneys were excised, incannulated, and perfused as described in Section “Materials 
and Methods.” Cy5.5-labeled Ergidina was injected through the renal artery. Each organ was visualized, washed, and analyzed again by time-domain optical 
imaging. Experimental conditions were maintained in all the groups except for the temperature of the binding (A), the time of the binding (B), the period of kidney 
ischemia (C), or the amount of injected Ergidina (D). Data are expressed as mean of the amount of bound antibody ± SD obtained from three organs per group.

isolated perfused rat heart stored at 4°C for 24 h. Frozen sections 
of this organ were incubated with Cy5.5-labeled Ergidina and 
examined by confocal microscopy. Figure S4 in Supplementary 
Material shows that the endothelium of ischemic heart is cov￾ered by RGD-guided anti-C5 antibody.
Ergidina Prevents Tissue Damage in a Rat 
Model of Kidney Ischemia/Reperfusion
The finding that Ergidina preferentially accumulates in rat renal 
vessels in vivo suggested a potential use of the targeted antibody 
to prevent renal C-mediated damage. This hypothesis was tested 
in a rat model of kidney IRI described in Section “Materials and 
Methods.”
Prior to the ischemic injury, the animals received 0.25  mg 
of Ergidina found in the ex vivo experiments to fully cover 
the renal endothelium. After 45  min of ischemia, the kidney 
was reperfused and samples of serum and urine were collected 
24 and 96  h later for analysis. The data reported in Figure  6
show clear signs of renal impairment in animals receiving the 
control antibody with marked increase in both protein excretion 
and serum creatinine level peaking 24  h after reperfusion. In 
contrast, Ergidina was able to completely prevent C-mediated 
damages, as revealed by the lack of significant changes in protein 
and creatinine concentrations that were comparable to those 
collected before IRI. The effect of Ergidina was still apparent 
4  days after induction of ischemia despite the marked reduc￾tion in the protein and creatinine levels observed in the control 
group of rats.
We also investigated the ability of Ergidina to control 
C-mediated tissue damage in ischemic kidneys removed from 
rats treated with the C5 neutralizing and control antibodies. 
A strong C activation was observed in the ischemic rat model

Methods.” Values are the mean of four rats per group.

that proceeds to completion of the reaction sequence as docu￾mented by C3 and C9 deposition in the kidneys of rats receiving 
an irrelevant antibody. As expected, administration of Ergidina 
to rats undergoing renal IRI did not prevent C3 deposition 
but resulted in the complete inhibition of C5 activation and 
an undetectable localization of C9 on glomeruli and vascular 
endothelium (Figure 7).
Histologic analysis of ischemic kidney of rats treated with 
the control antibody revealed extensive necrosis of tubular cells, 
and some degree of glomerular hypercellularity and mesangial 
hyperplasia (Figure 8). Injection of Ergidina proved to be effec￾tive in preventing tissue injury both at glomerular and tubular 
level, reducing the damage score to more than half compared to 
that observed in the control group of rats.
The dose of Ergidina used in this study was sufficient to fully 
inhibit C5 activation at renal level preventing tissue injury and 
increase in serum creatinine and urine protein levels, and was not 
associated with any overt sign of toxicity.
DISCUSSION
Efforts are being made to develop drugs that preferentially 
localize in organs and tissues undergoing a pathologic process 
mediated by effector molecules present in the circulation and in 
the body fluids. C has been largely implicated in several patho￾logic conditions and C neutralization has been shown to exert 
beneficial effect in preventing tissue and organs damage in both 
experimental and clinical settings (1, 2). For example, targeting

C5 with the neutralizing antibody Eculizumab in humans has 
proved effective in controlling disease severity and progression 
in patients with PNH (4), aHUS (5), membranoproliferative 
glomerulonephritis (28), and antiphospholipid syndrome (29). 
Nevertheless, this therapeutic approach, though successful, is 
fraught with limitations due to the high cost and the possible 
side effects associated with generalized inactivation of the C 
system (30, 31). Our data indicate that this therapeutic strategy 
can be improved by developing a recombinant antibody that 
accumulates predominantly in the pathologic tissue.
To target endothelial cells with a neutralizing anti-C5 anti￾body, we used a recombinant human anti-C5 miniantibody 
recognizing C5 from human and other animal species (6) fused 
to the RGD-4C peptide at the Fc terminus. RGD-4C was selected 
for the study because this cyclic peptide offers several advantages 
over the linear peptide including increased structural stability, 
reduced susceptibility to degradation, and higher affinity for the 
target molecules (32).
Cyclic RGD has extensively been used in tumor-bearing mice 
to deliver imaging probes or drugs to tumor tissue for diagnos￾tic and therapeutic purposes exploiting the ability of the peptide 
to recognize with high affinity αvβ3 integrin highly expressed 
in tumor vessels (33). The in  vivo distribution of Ergidina 
observed in rats after i.v. administration suggests that RGD-4C 
can be used as a vehicle to deliver the neutralizing anti-C5 
miniantibody to the kidney. The renal localization of Ergidina 
cannot be attributed to the clearance of the molecule, because 
its molecular weight of approximately 120 kDa is well above the 
size limit of the molecules filtering through the glomeruli under 
physiologic conditions. The weak fluorescent signal observed 
in the bladder is due to small amount of free fluorescent dye 
excreted in the urine (20, 27). A plausible explanation for the 
preferential homing of the neutralizing anti-C5 antibody to 
the kidney is that the recombinant molecule interacts with 
integrins expressing RGD-binding sites. Although αvβ3 and 
αvβ5 that bind RGD-4C peptide with high affinity are not 
expressed on quiescent endothelial cells, the mild staining of 
the vascular endothelium in normal kidney can possibly be 
justified by the presence of other integrins that bind less avidly 
RGD-4C, including α5β1 expressed on the endothelial cells of 
normal glomeruli (34, 35). The stronger immunofluorescence 
signal observed in the glomeruli of kidneys obtained from rats 
following IRI compared to untreated controls is consistent with 
the known ability of activated endothelial cells to express αvβ3 
(35). This is also supported by the finding that RGD binding 
sites colocalize with αvβ3 on the intimal surface of vessels in 
ischemic kidneys (36).
The preliminary data collected in rat ischemic organs 
evidenced the capacity of this targeting approach to address 
activated endothelial cells of the kidney, but also on the heart 
and probably other organs; our attention was focused on 
kidneys and in particular in the prevention of tissue damages 
after IR.
Our failure to detect proteinuria, increased level of creatinine, 
and renal histologic alterations in rats undergoing IR treated with 
Ergidina is in line with the results of previous studies showing C 
involvement in the renal IRI (37–39). Evidence collected from 
various groups indicates that C is primarily activated through the 
lectin pathway in kidneys undergoing IR, as revealed by the early 
deposition of mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and prevention of 
tissue damage in MBL-deficient animals (40–42). More recently, 
Farrar and colleagues showed that the lectin pathway may also 
be triggered in ischemic kidney a few hours after reperfusion by 
collectin-11 found to colocalize with C3d to renal tubules (43). 
There has been some controversy about the contribution of the 
late C components to IRI through the action of C5a and/or the 
terminal C complex. C5b-9 was considered to play a predominant 
role in a mouse model of renal IRI based on the observation 
that C6-deficient mice were protected from tissue damage (39). 
Conversely, C5 inhibition failed to prevent IRI in Lewis rats raising 
the possibility that the involvement of the late C components in 
mediating renal IR may vary in different species (42). Our finding 
that C5 neutralization by Ergidina correlates with the prevention 
of renal IRI in Wistar rats does not support this hypothesis in 
agreement with recent data showing that antibody-mediated 
C5 inhibition markedly reduces tissue damage after reperfusion 
and prolongs graft survival in a syngeneic rat model of kidney 
transplantation (44).
The development of Ergidina falls within our tissue targeting 
approach to control C-mediated tissue damage. This strategy 
started with the generation of the recombinant molecule MT07 
containing the C5 neutralizing antibody fused to a synovial￾homing peptide that was effective at preventing joint inflamma￾tion (45). Similar to MT07, Ergidina has definite advantages over 
the non-targeting parent anti-C5 miniantibody that inhibits 
activation of circulating C5 (6). As a result of its delivery to 
renal endothelium, the drug guarantees local protection from 
the C-mediated tissue damage without affecting circulating C5 
and consequently reducing the risk of infections associated with 
C5 depletion. This will be particularly important when treat￾ing patients with C-dependent chronic renal diseases, such as 
MPNG and aHUS (29), who require long-term therapy. In this 
case, treatment with the targeted recombinant molecule would 
be cost effective, since a limited amount of Ergidina (0.25 mg) 
corresponding to one-fourth of the dose required to partially 
inhibit circulating C5 (45) was sufficient to completely block 
the activation of C5 in the rat ischemic kidneys. The enhanced 
ex vivo binding to surgically removed kidney exposed to cold 
ischemia for 24 h followed by perfusion with the recombinant 
molecule supports its first therapeutic use to prevent posttrans￾plant IRI, leading to delay of graft function. The contribution 
of C to this pathologic condition is suggested by the beneficial 
effect obtained perfusing the kidney with other C inhibitors 
including the membrane-binding C regulator APT070 (46) and, 
more recently, an anti-rat C5 (44) prior to transplantation. The 
finding that the ex vivo binding of Ergidina was not restricted 
to the kidney, but was also seen on ischemic heart, suggests that 
this membrane-binding anti-C5 antibody may represent a useful 
tool to treat surgically removed organs prior to transplantation 
to prevent posttransplant IRI.
In conclusion, we present a preliminary characterization of a 
recombinant molecule comprising a neutralizing anti-C5 anti￾body fused to RGD that preferentially binds in vivo and ex vivo to 
the ischemic vascular endothelium of surgically removed organs.
