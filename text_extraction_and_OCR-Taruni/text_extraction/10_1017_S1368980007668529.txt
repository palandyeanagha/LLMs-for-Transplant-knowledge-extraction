Abstract
Objectives: To discuss present knowledge about the relation between adipose tissue,
inflammation and the Mediterranean-style diet.
Design: Review of the literature and personal perspectives.
Setting and results: Recent studies indicate that adipose tissue is an endocrine organ
producing numerous proteins, collectively referred to as adipokines, with broad
biological activity, which play an important autocrine role in obesity-associated
complications. Adipose tissue in general and visceral fat in particular are thought to be
key regulators of inflammation which is heavily involved in the onset and
development of atherothrombotic disease. Moreover, chronic inflammation may also
represent a triggering factor in the origin of the metabolic syndrome and type 2
diabetes mellitus. An increased release of proinflammatory adipokines from the
visceral adipose tissue, associated with a reduced secretion of anti-inflammatory
adipokines and cytokines, could determine a low-grade chronic inflammatory state
which might play a role in the future development of the metabolic syndrome,
diabetes and atherosclerosis through both insulin resistance and endothelial
dysfunction. Interventions aimed at decreasing weight loss and improving adherence
to a Mediterranean-style diet in people with obesity or metabolic syndrome decrease
the inflammatory milieu and ameliorate both insulin resistance and endothelial
dysfunction.
Conclusions: Appropriate dietary patterns, as those associated with the eating model
of Mediterranean-type diets, represent therapeutic strategies to reduce inflammation
and the associated metabolic and cardiovascular risk.

During the past 10 years, the prevalence of obesity in
the USA has increased from 23 to 31% of the country’s
280 million people1
. The latest National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey shows that approximately
127 million people are overweight, 60 million are obese
and 10 million have life-threatening morbid obesity.
Current trends indicate that obesity will increase to 39%
by 2010 and with it morbid obesity. An estimated
325 000 deaths, and between 4.3 and 5.7% of direct
health costs (approximately 39– 52 billion dollars) are
attributed to obesity annually. Results from the 1998
Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance Survey indicate
that roughly one-third of the USA adults were trying to
lose weight at that time, and another third were trying
to maintain weight2
. Hence, the rate of obesity and the
number of dieters are increasing in parallel. Obesity is
not only an American phenomenon. The worldwide
prevalence is increasing at such rapid pace that a WHO
consultation on obesity designated obesity as the major
unmet public health problem worldwide3
.
Obesity and inflammation
Adipose tissue was for a long time regarded as a relatively
passive site of energy store. This energy is accumulated in
the form of triglycerides during the period of excess food
consumption and mobilised when calorie intake is
inadequate. Recent studies indicate that adipose tissue is
an endocrine organ producing numerous proteins, collec￾tively referred to as adipokines, with broad biological
activity, which play an important autocrine role in
physiology and are involved in obesity-associated compli￾cations4
. A growing body of evidence implicates adipose
tissue in general and visceral adiposity in particular as key
regulators of inflammation. As adipose tissue secretes
proinflammatory cytokines, it becomes linked at the
molecular level to the dysregulation of a variety of
underlying systems all of which are causally implicated in
the development of atherosclerosis and metabolic outcomes.
Inflammation plays an important role in mediating all
phases of atherogenesis, from the initial recruitment of

circulating cells to the inner arterial layer to the weakening
of the fibrous cap of the plaque, eventually leading to
rupture. Inflammation is heavily involved in the onset and
development of atherothrombotic disease, which is
accompanied by the emergence of numerous inflammatory
biomarkers, including cytokines as the interleukins,
acute-phase proteins, adhesion molecules, interferons,
chemokines, etc. Several studies have demonstrated an
association between these biomarkers and current or future
events of coronary artery disease5
. A close relation is also
present between the biomarkers and glucose metabolism
abnormalities. For instance, chronic inflammation may also
represent a triggering factor in the origin of the metabolic
syndrome. Stimuli, such as overnutrition, physical inactiv￾ity and ageing would result in cytokine hypersecretion
and eventually lead to insulin resistance and diabetes
in genetically or metabolically predisposed individuals6
.
Proinflammatory cytokines
Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic-circulating cytokine
with effects ranging from inflammation to host defence to
tissue injury7
. Adipose cells contribute to one-third of
circulating IL-6 concentration, with visceral depots
releasing more IL-6 when compared with sc depots.
Plasma IL-6 levels positively correlate with human obesity
and insulin resistance, and elevated levels of IL-6 predict
the development of type 2 diabetes8 and future myocardial
infarction9
. The relative risk of future type 2 diabetes
mellitus for women in the highest vs. lowest quintiles of
these inflammatory markers was 7.5. Plasma IL-6 and
insulin sensitivity relationships seem to occur in parallel to
increases in plasma FFA. Finally, IL-6 may also decrease
insulin sensitivity by reducing adiponectin secretion10.
Large quantities of IL-6 are found in human atherosclerotic
plaques. Moreover, IL-6 impairs endothelium-dependent
dilatation in human veins in vivo11.
So far, the potential mechanism proposed to explain the
effect of tumour necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) on obesity￾related insulin resistance includes increased release of FFA
by adipocytes, reduction in adiponectin synthesis and
impairment of insulin signalling12. Induction of insulin
resistance by TNF-a is mediated through its ability to
produce serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor
substrate-1, decreasing the tyrosine kinase activity of the
insulin receptor. Increased plasma levels of the soluble
fraction of TNF receptor 2 have been found associated
with insulin resistance in healthy volunteers, in lean non￾diabetic offspring of type 2 diabetic subjects, and in young
obese subjects13. Moreover, infusion of exogenous TNF-a
determines endothelial dysfunction in normal subjects
linked to insulin resistance14. The synthesis of adipose
tissue TNF-a, as measured by reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction in abdominal subcutaneous
adipose tissue samples, could induce the production
of IL-6, CRP and other acute-phase reactants, thus
contributing to the maintenance of chronic low-grade
inflammation state involved in the progression of obesity.
Although C-reactive protein (PCR) is not an adipokine,
its circulating concentrations are under the control of
adipokines and its role in inflammation is well defined.
Cross-sectional analyses have shown strong and indepen￾dent associations of CRP levels with measures of body
fat15,16. High levels of CRP in obesity also predict later
development of diabetes17. Rapidly evolving work now
demonstrated that in addition to being a marker on innate
immunity, CRP also has several direct effects at the level of
vessel wall18. CRP is not only an inflammatory marker
of atherosclerosis or coronary events, but also a mediator
of the disease because it contributes to the substrate
underlying lesion formation, plaque rupture and coronary
thrombosis by promoting endothelial cell activation.
Human recombinant CRP, at concentrations known to
predict vascular disease, elicits a multitude of effects on
endothelial biology favouring a proinflammatory and
proatherosclerotic phenotype.
Anti-inflammatory cytokines
Adiponectin is an adipocyte-derived plasma protein with
insulin sensitising, anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic
properties. In human studies, plasma adiponectin levels
are negatively correlated with obesity, anthropometric
indices and insulin resistance, diabetic dyslipidaemia and
cardiovascular disease5
. Moreover, low plasma adiponec￾tin levels are an independent risk factor for future
development of type 2 diabetes19. Therefore, hypoadipo￾nectinaemia may be an important contributor to insulin
resistance and the metabolic syndrome. Although the
mechanisms by which adiponectin may ameliorate insulin
resistance are not entirely clear, it decreases circulating
FFA by increasing their oxidation by skeletal muscle20,
with resultant decreased triglyceride content and hence
improved insulin sensitivity. The reasons why adiponectin
levels are low in obesity might be due to insulin resistance
in the adipocyte, which attenuates or blunts insulin￾stimulated adiponectin secretion, or by increased suppres￾sion of its secretion by TNF-a and IL-612, whose levels are
reported to be raised in obesity. Our findings of an inverse
correlation between adiponectin increase and TNF-a
decrease after weight loss in obese women21 seem to give
some credit to the hypothesis that raised TNF-a circulating
levels in obesity are causally linked to reduced adipo￾nectin concentrations. In addition to its effects on fuel
homeostasis, adiponectin displays anti-inflammatory
properties.
IL-10 is a centrally operating cytokine secreted by
activated monocytes/macrophages and lymphocytes, and
possesses multifaceted anti-inflammatory and insulin￾sensitising properties by antagonising IL-6 and TNF-a. A
low production capacity of IL-10 has been found to be
associated with the metabolic syndrome and type 2

diabetes22 – 24. Experimental studies using gene-targeted
mice25 provide direct evidence that IL-10 offers some
protection against endothelial dysfunction during diabetes
and that this effect is mediated by inhibition of increased in
superoxide anion in blood vessels. A reduced IL-10 serum
level represents a marker of plaque instability favouring
the development of acute coronary syndromes, and also
indicative of a poor prognosis even after the occurrence of
an acute ischaemic event caused by plaque instability26.
A working hypothesis
On the basis of the available evidence described above, it
could be hypothesised that an increased release of
proinflammatory adipokines, mainly IL-6 and TNF-a,
from the visceral adipose tissue, associated with a reduced
secretion of anti-inflammatory adipokines and cytokines,
mainly adiponectin and IL-10, can determine a low-grade
chronic inflammatory state. The proinflammatory milieu
generated by the imbalance between pro- and anti￾inflammatory adipokines and cytokines might play a role
in the future development of the metabolic syndrome,
diabetes and atherosclerosis through both a reduced
sensitivity of target tissues to insulin (insulin resistance)
and a reduced anti-atherosclerotic function of the
endothelium (endothelial dysfunction).
Healthy lifestyle and inflammation
The goal of obesity therapy is weight reduction, mainly
through dieting and exercise. Even modest weight loss of
10% or less is associated with a substantial improvement in
coexisting illnesses27. For example, in a randomised
controlled study conducted in 120 obese women, we
demonstrated that a multidisciplinary program aimed at
reducing weight through lifestyle changes (diet and
exercise) was associated with amelioration in circulating
markers of vascular inflammation, including reduced
levels of CRP and IL-6, and increased levels of adiponectin,
associated with improved insulin sensitivity21. Unfortu￾nately, our current urbanised, sedentary lifestyle and
super-sized portions of food (characterised by our
culturally oriented, chronic consumption of easily obtain￾able energy-dense liquids and foods) lead to fat storage, to
which our hunter –gatherer species is genetically
predisposed.
We explored possible mechanisms underlying a dietary
intervention in patients at increased cardiac risk28. We
randomised 180 patients (99 men and 81 women) with the
metabolic syndrome to a Mediterranean-style diet (instruc￾tions about increasing daily consumption of whole grains,
vegetables, fruits, nuts and olive oil) vs. a cardiac-prudent
diet with fat intake less than 30%. Physical activity
increased equally in both the groups. After 2 years, body
weight decreased more in the intervention group than in
the control group, but even after controlling for weight
loss, inflammatory markers, such as IL-6, IL-7, IL-18 and
C-reactive protein, and insulin resistance declined more in
the intervention group than in the control group, while
endothelial function improved. Only 40 patients in the
intervention group still had metabolic syndrome after 2
years when compared with 78 patients on the control diet;
thus, the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome was
reduced approximately by one half. These results suggest
a plausible mechanism for the beneficial effects of a
Mediterranean-style diet.
Conclusions
Obesity is a growing health problem. Excess weight and
obesity increase morbidity and mortality associated with
numerous complications, including type 2 diabetes
mellitus, hyperlipidaemia, hypertension and atherosclero￾sis27. Adipose tissue is both a dynamic endocrine organ, as
well as a highly active metabolic tissue. Fat produces and
secretes adipokines, which are known to play an
important role in the induction of insulin resistance and
in the atherosclerotic process. Visceral adiposity is more
strongly associated with insulin resistance than subcu￾taneous fat. However, the precise chain of events linking
overnutrition, obesity, activation of the innate immune
system and reduced insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues
remains incompletely understood. No specific dietary
recommendations have been advocated by health
agencies for treatment of insulin resistance or the
metabolic syndrome. Given that the metabolic syndrome
is an identifiable and potentially modifiable risk state for
both type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, adopting
a dietary pattern based on increased consumption of fruit
and vegetables, whole-grain cereal fibre, olive oil and nuts
may reduce the potential risk of these diseases.
