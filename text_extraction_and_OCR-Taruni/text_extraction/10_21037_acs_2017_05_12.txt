Background: Isolated septal myectomy is considered the gold standard for refractory left ventricular 
outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction at centers with dedicated hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy 
(HOCM) surgeons. In this paper, we provide an update on the Toronto General Hospital (TGH) experience 
for isolated septal myectomy and comment on the safety and efficacy of myectomy in patients with thin basal 
septal thickness at our institution.
Methods: We retrospectively reviewed all patients undergoing surgical myectomy at our institution from 
January 2012 to August 2016. We analyzed patient characteristics, intraoperative variables, pre- and post￾procedural echocardiographic parameters, and key outcomes including post-operative stroke, renal failure, 
iatrogenic ventricular septal defect (VSD), post-procedure insertion of permanent pacemaker, and mortality.
Results: At our institution, 150 isolated septal myectomy surgeries were performed over the study period. 
Preoperative echocardiography demonstrated an average basal septal thickness of 2.10±0.43 cm with a resting 
gradient of 67±37 mmHg and a provoked gradient of 89±40 mmHg. Fifty percent of patients had significant 
systolic anterior motion (SAM) of their mitral valve and 53% had associated moderate to severe mitral 
regurgitation (MR). Of note, 24% of patients had a thin septum of ≤1.7 cm. Discharge echocardiograms 
demonstrated significant septal reduction to an average basal septal thickness of 1.04±0.26 (P<0.05), with 
negligible resting and provokable LVOT gradients. At the time of discharge, none of the patients had 
significant SAM and only 5.3% of patients had residual greater than mild MR. Patients undergoing isolated 
myectomy with a thin basal septum had similar outcomes to those with a >1.7 cm septal thickness. In our 
contemporary cohort, there were no iatrogenic VSDs, 5.3% of patients required a permanent pacemaker and 
there was one early death.
Conclusions: Our cohort demonstrates that isolated septal myectomy remains a safe and effective 
operation that can achieve excellent results, irrespective of basal septal thickness, when done by experienced 
surgeons in a dedicated hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) center.

Introduction
Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) is 
characterized by left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) 
obstruction due to asymmetric septal hypertrophy and 
systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve. Patients 
who fail medical management and have ongoing symptoms 
of dyspnea, chest pain, or syncope can be managed by 
alcohol septal ablation (ASA) or surgical myectomy (1,2). 
In addition, some centres offer concomitant mitral valve 
surgery for primary treatment of LVOT obstruction and, 
most recently, the mitral clip procedure has been used for 
high-risk surgical patients (3,4). 
Surgical resection of muscle from the subaortic region 
to enlarge the LVOT results in relief of SAM of the mitral 
valve and its resultant mitral regurgitation (MR), and is the 
gold standard for refractory LVOT obstruction at centers 
with dedicated HOCM surgeons (1,5). In dedicated HOCM 
centres, mortality is typically less than 1% for isolated 
myectomies and is associated with excellent long-term 
survival (1,6-8). 
Our institution has a dedicated hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy (HCM) program and both of the major 
septal reduction strategies, septal myectomy and ASA, are 
offered. Our centre has generally performed ASA in patients 
with a suitable septal perforator branch and appropriate 
septal morphology (focal basal septal hypertrophy and color 
turbulence in the outflow tract). When comparing the two 
procedures at our centre, ASA is associated with a higher 
incidence of permanent pacing (9). In agreement with this 
data, larger series have demonstrated that patients greater 
than 65 years of age have greater survival, freedom from 
severe symptoms, and improved quality of life with isolated 
myectomy compared with ASA (10,11). 
A distinct group within symptomatic HOCM patients are 
those patients with thin basal septal thickness. Many centers 
offer ASA for symptomatic mild asymmetric hypertrophy 
and septal myectomy for those with significant hypertrophy, 
due to concerns of iatrogenic ventricular septal defects 
(VSDs), as well as the morbidity and mortality associated 
with advanced age in patients with mild septal hypertrophy. 
In addition, it is thought that the mechanism of LVOT 
obstruction in the absence of significant asymmetric 
hypertrophy may have contributions from abnormalities 
in the mitral-subvalvular apparatus, and some centres elect 
to perform concomitant mitral procedures to target this 
distinct population (3). In this paper, we provide an update 
on the TGH experience for isolated septal myectomy and 
comment on its safety and efficacy in patients with thin 
basal septal thickness at our institution. 
Methods
We retrospectively reviewed all patients undergoing 
myectomy surgical procedure [Morrow type resection (7)] 
at our institution from January 2012 to August 2016. All 
patients with isolated septal myectomy (including those 
undergoing concomitant LAD muscle bridge division, atrial 
fibrillation, and aortoplasty procedures) were analyzed for 
patient characteristics, intraoperative variables, and pre- and 
post-procedural echocardiographic parameters. Descriptive 
statistics such as proportion mean with standard deviation 
and median with interquartile range (IQR) were used as 
appropriate. Statistical comparisons were done by t-tests 
and chi square or Fisher exact tests when appropriate. A 
P value of less than 0.05 indicated statistical significance. 
Key outcomes included post-operative stroke, renal failure, 
iatrogenic VSD, post procedure insertion of permanent 
pacemaker, and mortality.
Results
Major cardiac surgical procedures for HOCM patients
At our institution, between January 2012 and August 2016, 
150 isolated septal myectomy surgeries were performed 
using a Morrow type resection (7). In addition, there were 
65 patients who underwent myectomy with concomitant 
coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), 17 patients 
who underwent myectomy with mitral valve repair or 
replacements, and 59 patients who underwent myectomy 
and other concomitant cardiac surgery, such as combined 
valve and CABG procedures (Table 1). Of those patients 
undergoing isolated septal myectomy, 6% (n=9) had a 
concomitant atrial fibrillation procedure. 
Patient characteristics of HOCM patients undergoing 
isolated septal myectomy
In the cohort of patients undergoing isolated septal 
myectomy, the median age at time of operation was 52 years 
with 62% of the patients being male. The majority of 
patients had severe symptoms refractory to medical 
management, with 65% of patients reporting NYHA class 
III-IV symptoms, and 58% reporting CCS class III-IV 
symptoms at the time of surgery. In addition, 27% reported

having syncope prior to surgical intervention (Table 1). 
Surgical relief of LVOT obstruction
Preoperative characteristics on echocardiography 
demonstrated an average basal septal thickness of 
2.10±0.43 cm, with a resting gradient of 67±37 mmHg and 
a provoked gradient of 89±40 mmHg. Fifty percent (n=75) 
of patients had significant SAM on their preoperative 
echocardiogram and 53% (n=79) had associated moderate 
to severe MR. The average left atrial size was 4.5±0.7 cm 
and the right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) was 
33±10 mmHg in this cohort. 
The average cardiopulmonary bypass time was 
58±13 minutes with a cross clamp time of 38±11 minutes. 
Postoperatively, patients were extubated after 4 (IQR, 2.6–
5.8) hours, the length of stay in intensive care was a median 
of 26 (IQR, 24–48) hours, and time to discharge was 6 
(IQR, 5–7) days. 
Discharge echocardiograms demonstrated significant 
septal reduction to an average basal septal thickness of 
1.04±0.26 (P<0.05). Resting LVOT gradients were 
11±7 mmHg, with no significant increase in provokable 
gradient (13±9 mmHg). At the time of discharge, none of 
the patients had significant SAM and only 5.3% of patients 
had residual greater than mild MR (Table 2). Of those 
with residual MR at time of discharge, available follow-up 
echocardiograms revealed only mild MR. 
Of note, 24% (n=36) of patients had mild asymmetric 
hypertrophy, with a resting basal septum of ≤1.7 cm. In this 
contemporary cohort, patients with a basal septal thickness 
≤1.7 cm were 57 (range 48–62) years of age, compared to 
51 (range 40–59) years of age with a septum greater than 
1.7 cm. Resting (67±37 vs. 67±40 mmHg) and provokable 
gradients (88±39 vs. 94±43 mmHg) and the amount of 
patients with significant SAM or significant MR were not 
different between those with a basal septal thickness ≤1.7 cm 
versus those with a septum thickness greater than 1.7 cm. 
Post-operatively, both groups had negligible gradients, 
with no residual SAM or significant MR on their discharge 
echocardiogram (Table 3). Overall, there were no deaths or 
iatrogenic VSDs in the thin septal thickness group.
Outcomes for isolated myectomy patients
Within this contemporary cohort, there was one death due 
to heart failure attributed to severe diastolic dysfunction and 
post-operative renal failure. In our cohort, three patients 
(2%) had a diagnosis of a postoperative cerebrovascular 
event, with two having mild neurological deficits. In the 150 
patients undergoing isolated septal myectomy, there were no 
iatrogenic VSDs and a permanent pacemaker was required 
in 5.3% (n=8) of patients, of whom four had a preoperative 
electrocardiogram with a right bundle branch block. In 
addition, three patients had an automated implantable 
cardioverter defibrillator (AICD) placed post-operatively.
Discussion
In agreement with results from dedicated HCM centres, 
surgical relief of LVOT obstruction by surgical myectomy 
is both safe and efficacious. In this contemporary cohort 
spanning approximately four years, early postoperative

mortality is 0.7% and there is clinically significant 
perioperative reduction in SAM and associated MR. In 
addition, there were no iatrogenic VSDs in our cohort 
and a low incidence of permanent pacemaker insertion. 
This confirms our previously published results, which 
have demonstrated excellent long-term survival of 98% 
at one year postoperatively, and extends the literature of 
contemporary surgical cohorts (10,11). 
As a dedicated centre for HOCM, we have seen a 
small evolution in referrals for patients. In particular, 
there have been increasing referrals for patients who 
are older with mild asymmetric hypertrophy who have 
refractory symptoms. These patients typically have a basal 
septal thickness ≤1.7 cm and include those with sigmoid 
septum anatomy or those with high dynamic gradients in 
the absence of obvious abnormalities in the sub-valvular 
apparatus. Despite the thin basal septal thickness in this 
small cohort, resolution of symptoms, perioperative 
mortality, insertion of pacemakers, and incidence of 
iatrogenic VSDs were not different between these 
subgroups. This finding is consistent with the consensus 
guidelines that advocate septal myectomy at dedicated 
centres for drug-refractory symptomatic HOCM patients, 
regardless of absolute basal septal thickness.
Recent use of three-dimensional echocardiography and 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has identified HOCM 
patients with subtle findings of elongated mitral valves and 
displaced papillary muscles (12-17); however, guidelines as 
to when to intervene on the mitral-subvalvular apparatus 
in conjunction with LVOT obstruction in the setting of 
HOCM remains unclear and largely dictated by individual 
center practices. Some centres advocate performing 
additional mitral procedures in patients with a basal septum 
less than 1.8 cm (4). In our series, we demonstrate that 
in the absence of preoperative identified intrinsic mitral 
valve pathology, adequate septal myectomy is sufficient to 
abolish SAM and associated hemodynamically significant 
MR. This is in agreement with a recent study published 
by the Mayo Clinic (18,19), which also showed that SAM￾related MR in obstructive HCM was effectively treated 
with adequate septal myectomy, with only 1.7% having 
residual ≥ grade 3 MR. 
Limitations
This retrospective study describes isolated myectomy 
surgical outcomes at a single institution and is limited to 
reporting outcomes related to perioperative complications 
and echocardiographic findings associated with HOCM. 
Conclusions
Our cohort demonstrates that isolated septal myectomy 
remains a safe and effective operation that can achieve 
excellent results, irrespective of basal septal thickness, when 
performed by experienced surgeons in a dedicated HCM 
center.
