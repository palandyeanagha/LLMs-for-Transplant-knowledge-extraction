Abstract
Background: Despite fears of compromised oxygen delivery in
patients with Eisenmenger syndrome during flight on commercial
aircraft, a clinical study has shown no adverse effects, and many
patients travel frequently.
Methods: The air travel history over the past decade of 53 patients
with Eisenmenger syndrome and 48 acyanotic patients was
obtained. Patients listed all flights and destinations, and any major
adverse event or symptoms, including, specifically, headache,
palpitations, oedema or need for supplemental oxygen. For the
patients with Eisenmenger syndrome, a full blood count, 6-minute
walk test and p50 of the oxygen–haemoglobin dissociation curve
were also obtained.
Results: 1157 flights were reported evenly between the two groups.
Thirteen patients with Eisenmenger syndrome reported no travel in
the past 10 years (vs 4/48 acyanotic patients, p = 0.03), six of
whom were told not to fly by healthcare providers. Of those who
flew, the number and distance of flights was similar in both groups.
No major adverse events were reported. One patient with
Eisenmenger syndrome possibly had a transient ischaemic attack
and a second patient needed supplemental oxygen when exposed to
ambient cigarette smoke in flight. Other symptoms such as
headache, palpitations and lower extremity oedema at the travel
destination were reported with similar frequency in both groups.
Patients with Eisenmenger syndrome had a raised p50 of the
oxygen–haemoglobin dissociation curve (mean (SD) 29.4 (2.6) mm
Hg vs 27 (3) mm Hg in laboratory controls, p<0.01).


Conclusions: Patients with Eisenmenger syndrome report travelling
frequently and safely on commercial airlines. Shifts in the oxygen–
haemoglobin dissociation curve are likely to attenuate the effects of
low oxygen tension. Patients with Eisenmenger syndrome should,
nevertheless, be advised to avoid inactivity and dehydration as
usual, but there is no justification for limiting air travel.
