SUMMARY A prospective analysis of the morbidity and mortality after peritoneovenous shunting
was carried out in 25 patients who had a total of 27 shunts for refractory ascites. Major
complications were limited to the patients in whom ascites was secondary to hepatic rather than
peritoneal disease. Immediate postoperative complications followed 17 out of the 23 shunts
carried out in patients with liver disease and included septicaemia (two), profound hypotension
(two), pulmonary oedema (one), and clinically evident disseminated intravascular coagulation
(14). Long term morbidity was again limited to the patients with liver disease and included
chronic shunt infection (two) and major venous thrombosis (two). Shunt associated mortality was
only seen in the patients with liver disease. Despite late shunt blockage in five long term survivors
with alcoholic liver disease fluid retention was easily controlled by simple medical means
probably because of improved liver function associated with abstinence from alcohol. It is
concluded that: (1) patients with hepatic and malignant ascites respond differently to the
insertion of a peritoneovenous shunt; (2) Shunt patency should be monitored regularly in patients
with liver disease and, because of the potential for septic and thrombotic complications, if
blocked the shunt should be removed and; (3) because of the morbidity and mortality of
peritoneovenous shunt surgery in patients with liver disease and refractory ascites, an alternative
mode of therapy, such as repeated ultrafiltration and reinfusion of ascitic fluid, may be a more
effective initial therapeutic approach especially in patients in whom there is a reversible element
to their underlying liver disease.
Peritoneovenous shunts were first reported to be
useful in the treatment of refractory ascites in 1974.1
There are a number of immediate and dramatic
benefits which follow shunt insertion including
increase in renal blood flow, glomerular filtration
rate and renal salt and water excretion, decrease in
plasma renin and aldosterone concentrations and
ascites becomes controllable with a reduced or
absent need for diuretics.2 3 Unfortunately, peri￾toneovenous shunt surgery has also been associated
with considerable short and long term morbidity and
mortality. Complications include fever, dissemi￾nated intravascular coagulation (DIC), shunt occlu￾sion, hypokalaemia, infection, ascites leak, variceal
haemorrhage, bowel obstruction, pulmonary
oedema, air embolism, and pneumothorax.4 In one

series of 23 patients, six died within a month of
surgery and complications occurred in more than
two-thirds of the patients.5 Because of these prob￾lems, the precise role of peritoneovenous shunts in
the treatment of refractory ascites remains to be
defined.
This study reports on shunt patency and shunt
associated morbidity and mortality in a prospective
short and long term follow up study of 25 patients
who received 27 peritoneovenous shunts.
Methods
PATIENTS
Twenty five patients received 27 peritoneovenous
(Le Veen) shunts as the definitive treatment for
refractory ascites over a six year period. All patients
had ascites which was resistant to therapy in
hospital with bed rest, salt restriction, diuretic
therapy and infusion of salt poor albumin. Patient

non-compliance, inadvertent sodium administration
and electrolyte imbalance were excluded and the
ascites was considered refractory if therapy was
complicated by signs of intravascular volume deple￾tion with postural hypotension and progressive
impairment of renal function in the absence of
significant fluid mobilisation. In 21 patients the
ascites was secondary to hepatic disease and in four
it was caused by metastatic spread of carcinoma to
the peritoneum. The cause of the ascites is detailed
in the Table. Patients with liver disease were graded
before surgery according to the clinical and bio￾chemical criteria of Pugh.6 No patient was grade A,
12 were grade B, and nine were grade C. All
peritoneovenous shunts were inserted by one of two
surgeons.
The immediate postoperative course was re￾viewed closely and the patients subsequent clinical
course was monitored carefully. Shunt patency was
assessed following the intraperitoneal injection of
technetium 99m sulphur colloid7 before discharge
from hospital and subsequently at irregular inter￾vals. All patients who are currently alive had their
shunt patency tested just before completion of the
study.
Results
EARLY MORBIDITY
A wide range of problems complicated the patients
clinical course between the time of insertion of the
peritoneovenous shunt and their discharge from
hospital.. Five shunts failed to function in the
immediate postoperative period. This occurred pre￾dominantly in the earlier cases in the series and was
largely related to malposition of the venous end of
the shunt. Reoperation usually proved necessary to
establish flow and this problem has been overcome
with surgical experience. Other complications de￾veloped only in the patients with liver disease as a
cause of their ascites. These 21 patients received a
total of 23 shunts and immeditate postoperative
complications occurred in 17 (74%). In all, the

complication was of major clinical import and
contributed to the deaths of eight patients. One
patient developed pulmonary oedema. Two patients
developed profound hypotension in the absence of
sepsis. Both patients responded to a period of
inotropic support with dopamine which was slowly
withdrawn over two to three days as the patients
condition stabilised. Two patients developed septi￾caemia despite a diagnostic paracentesis having
demonstrated sterile ascites 48 hours before shunt
insertion. Finally 14 patients developed clinically
evident DIC and shunt ligation was necessary to
control bleeding in four of these patients.
LATE MORBIDITY
No shunt associated morbidity was encountered in
the long term follow up of the four patients in whom
surgery was undertaken for malignant ascites. In all
patients in whom the shunt remained patent the
ascites was easily controlled.
Among the 13 patients with ascites complicating
liver disease who were discharged from hospital
after 15 peritoneovenous shunts there was consider￾able long term morbidity. Two patients developed a
chronic shunt infection, one of whom had an
associated glomerulonephritis which resolved on
shunt removal and the other died of staphylococcal
septicaemia after self-withdrawal of long term anti￾biotic therapy. Two patients developed major
venous thrombosis adjacent to the site of insertion
of the venous arm of the shunt, one of the right
brachiocephalic vein and the other of the superior
vena cava.
SHUNT BLOCKAGE
All patients with malignant ascites were discharged
from hospital with a functioning shunt. In two the
valve subsequently blocked and required replace￾ment. Thirteen of the patients with liver disease
were discharged from hospital on 15 separate
occasions after insertion of a peritoneovenous
shunt. In 14 the shunt was working at the time of
discharge and in 11 of these has subsequently
spontaneously blocked. Generally the blockage
occurred in the valve or in the venous limb of the
shunt. There are currently six surviving patients
some seven to 54 months after shunt insertion. Five
of these patients, all with alcoholic liver disease,
have either had their shunts removed or they are
known to be blocked. Despite this all five long term
survivors with non-functioning shunts are on little or
no diuretic therapy and ascites is not a clinical
problem.
MORTALITY

the four patients with malignant ascites but all these
patients died within three months of shunt insertion
as a result of widespread malignancy. Of the 21
patients with liver disease eight died during the
admission in which their shunt was inserted and in
all cases shunt related complications contributed to
their death. Seven other patients have subsequently
died within a year of shunt insertion. Death was
usually related to the underlying liver disease or
complicating malignancy but, in three, late compli￾cations associated with the shunt were contributing
factors.
Cumulative survival curves have been calculated
from life table analysis on the 21 patients who
underwent peritoneovenous shunt surgery for the
treatment of liver disease complicated by refractory
ascites. Early mortality is obviously high and the
survival curve plateaus at approximately 12 months
(Figure).
Discussion
This study has shown that peritoneovenous shunt
surgery for refractory ascites can be associated with
considerable morbidity in both the short and long
term and that shunt related complications often
contribute to mortality. Although these results are
consistent with some of the published data,5 8 it is in
marked contrast with other more favourable re￾ports.9 10
Major complications were limited to the patient
group in whom ascites was secondary to hepatic
rather than peritoneal disease. All the patients with
malignant ascites had an uncomplicated postopera￾tive course with good control of their ascites and this
is consistent with other studies on the use of
peritoneovenous shunts in such patients." 12 Pa￾0 2 4 6 8 10 12

tients with malignant ascites secondary to carcinoma
of the breast or ovary have a relatively good
prognosis compared with other forms of peritoneal
malignancy'2 and they should receive the greatest
benefit from peritoneovenous shunt surgery.
In contrast the postoperative course of the pa￾tients with ascites secondary to liver disease was
notable for the number of serious complications.
Clinical DIC was only seen in this group. Labora￾tory evidence of DIC can complicate peritoneo￾venous shunt surgery in patients with both hepatic13
and malignant ascites" although it is rarely clinically
evident in the latter group." 12 Independent of
aetiology, ascites has been shown to contain col￾lagen with the ability to activate both platelets and
Factor X, both of which will tend to initiate
DIC.14 15 There are a number of reasons why
patients with hepatic ascites may be more suscep￾tible to clinical DIC after peritoneovenous shunts
than patients with malignant ascites. Patients with
liver disease often have laboratory evidence of
impaired haemostasis before surgery and poor
hepatic function prevents them responding
adequately to the increased synthetic demands
imposed by the rapid consumption of clotting
factors. They also often have low levels of anti￾thrombin III, a naturally occurring coagulation
inhibitor and their ability to remove activated
clotting factors may also be compromised.
Sepsis was a major cause of morbidity and
mortality after peritoneovenous shunt surgery in this
and other studies.5 16 To prevent this complication it
is important to definitively exclude spontaneous
bacterial peritonitis by appropriate ascitic fluid
analysis on the day of surgery. When shunt infection
does occur, however, it cannot be eradicated by
prolonged antibiotic therapy and complications of
chronic sepsis such as glomerulonephritis17 18 may
develop. Once infection has been documented the
shunt should be removed.'6
A complication not previously reported but seen
in the immediate postoperative period in two of the
patients in this series was profound non-septic
hypotension. The pathogenesis of this complication
remains obscure but implies the presence of some
vasoactive substance, possibly endotoxin,19 in the
ascitic fluid of some patients with liver disease
capable of producing marked circulatory collapse.
There was a high rate of spontaneous shunt
blockage in both the malignant and hepatic patient
groups. Although ascites was refractory to medical
therapy preoperatively the long term survivors with
blocked shunts required minimal or no diuretic
therapy. All had active decompensated alcoholic
liver disease at the time of shunt surgery but they
subsequently abstained from or reduced their alco￾1072

hol intake with slow but steady improvement in their
clinical status and liver function. These findings
indicate that the absence of ascites does not imply
shunt patency and emphasises the need for regular
dynamic assessment of shunt flow. Because of the
potential for septic and thrombotic complications
the shunts should be removed if shown to be non
functioning.
Two groups of patients with liver disease and
refractory ascites were evident in this study. One
group had inactive end stage or progressive liver
disease which was not amenable to currently avail￾able therapy and their prognosis was poor. The
other group, although presenting with decompen￾sated liver disease, had active liver cell damage with
the potential for partial reversibility if the activity
could be controlled. Their refractory ascites could
thus be considered temporary. In both groups the
need for peritoneovenous shunting is only short
term and all could thus be considered suitable for
intermittent ultrafiltration and reinfusion of ascitic
fluid,201 21 a procedure with apparently less acute
morbidity and mortality and obviously none of the
long term morbidity of the peritoneovenous shunt.
Certainly such a comparison should be worthy of
controlled study.
