Abstract
Background: Aspergillus fumigatus is a common airborne fungal pathogen for humans. It frequently causes an invasive
aspergillosis (IA) in immunocompromised patients with poor prognosis. Potent antifungal drugs are very expensive and
cause serious adverse effects. Their correct application requires an early and specific diagnosis of IA, which is still not
properly achievable. This work aims to a specific detection of A. fumigatus by immunofluorescence and the generation of
recombinant antibodies for the detection of A. fumigatus by ELISA.
Results: The A. fumigatus antigen Crf2 was isolated from a human patient with proven IA. It is a novel variant of a group of
surface proteins (Crf1, Asp f9, Asp f16) which belong to the glycosylhydrolase family. Single chain fragment variables (scFvs)
were obtained by phage display from a human naive antibody gene library and an immune antibody gene library generated
from a macaque immunized with recombinant Crf2. Two different selection strategies were performed and shown to
influence the selection of scFvs recognizing the Crf2 antigen in its native conformation. Using these antibodies, Crf2 was
localized in growing hyphae of A. fumigatus but not in spores. In addition, the antibodies allowed differentiation between A.
fumigatus and related Aspergillus species or Candida albicans by immunofluorescence microscopy. The scFv antibody clones
were further characterized for their affinity, the nature of their epitope, their serum stability and their detection limit of Crf2
in human serum.
Conclusion: Crf2 and the corresponding recombinant antibodies offer a novel approach for the early diagnostics of IA
caused by A. fumigatus.

Introduction
Aspergillus fumigatus is a common airborne human fungal
pathogen. In addition to allergic diseases A. fumigatus causes the
highly lethal form of invasive aspergillosis (IA) [1]. In the past two
decades the number of IA cases increased, due to the ever
increasing number of susceptible patients [2–5]. The largest group
among these are individuals with hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation (HSCT) or solid organ transplantation requiring
permanent immunosuppression [3,6,7]. Today, IA is the number
one cause of death due to infectious complications in allogeneic
bone marrow transplantation [8], despite the availability of potent
drugs such as amphotericin B, azole derivatives or echinocandins
[3,9]. A possible reason for this is the gradual development of
resistance in Aspergillus as well as the occurrence of side effects of
drug usage and lack of initial response that could lead to the
interruption of the treatment [10,11]. Other diseases caused by A.
fumigatus are the aspergilloma [12,13] and allergic bronchopulmo￾nary aspergillosis (ABPA) [14–16].
The non invasive early diagnosis of IA is currently done by real
time PCR amplifying A. fumigatus specific DNA sequences, by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 August 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 8 | e6625

galactomannan (GM) or an assay for the detection of (1R3)-b-D￾Glucan (BG). These assays lack sensitivity and specificity, but the
reliability of IA diagnosis can be improved by combining the
galactomannan ELISA and PCR [17,18,5]. An early diagnosis of
IA is critical for a successful antifungal treatment with antimycotics
[19,2]. In later stages of the IA the disease can be detected by
computed tomography (CT) [20,21].
Todate, many A. fumigatus specific antigens were described [1],
but only a few were further characterized. Very well characterized
are the A. fumigatus glycosylhydrolases/glycosyltranferases Asp f9,
Asp f16 and Crf1. All three proteins are encoded by the crf1 gene
and are splice variants of its pre-mRNA, resulting in three different
mRNAs crf1, asp f9 and asp f16. Their proposed tranlation products
have a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor and are located in
the cell wall of growing hyphae [22–27]. Asp f16 was succesfully
used for active vaccination of mammals resulting in the protection of
A. fumigatus infection [23,28,24], but recently the existence of Asp
f16 became doubtful [29].
The aim of this study was the cloning and expression of Asp f9, Asp
f16 or Crf for the generation of recombinant antibodies by antibody
phage display to develop a histopathological detection system for A.
fumigatus by immunofluorescence and a serum diagnostic assay by
ELISA. In this process, a new variant of these glycosylhydrolases was
isolated, named Crf2 and used for the selection of single chain variable
fragments (scFvs) by phage display, followed by characterization of
these antibody fragments and the specific detection of A. fumigatus.
Results
Isolation and characterization of Crf2
An A. fumigatus cultivation derived from bronchoalveolar lavage
material of a human patient with proven invasive aspergillosis (IA)
was used as a source for mRNA isolation and reverse transcription
(RT-) PCR. By using asp f16 (NCBI [www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov]:
AF062651) or crf1 (NCBI: NC_007194.1) (CADRE [www.
cadre-genomes.org.uk] [30]: AFUA_6G08510) specific PCR￾primer sets, two PCR products of 822 and 948 bp were obtained
instead of the expected product of about 1134 bp representing full￾length asp f16. The first PCR product encoded asp f9 with one
point mutation (aa position 218 M.V) and the second did not
represent any known gene product (Fig. 1).
Cloning and sequence analysis of all obtained amplification
products confirmed the absence of full-length asp f16, but identified
a novel variant, which we named crf2 due to its partial similarity to
the published crf1 [31]. This variant encodes aa 1–327 of Crf1
(XP_752985), which are directly followed by aa 390–395 of Crf1
and a stop codon (Fig. 2).
Production of Crf2
The Crf2 encoding cDNA was cloned into a pET21a(+) plasmid
(Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) using E. coli XL-1 Blue MRF’
(Stratagene, Amsterdam, Netherland) cells. Crf2 protein expression
was performed in BLR(DE3) (Invitrogen) cells and purified by
immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) followed by ion
exchange chromatography (IEC). The production and purification
was analysed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot (Fig. 2). The
purified Crf2 protein preparation did not contain contaminations
detectable by Coomassie stained SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A). Immuno￾blots did not indicate breakdown products (Fig. 2B).
Verification of the expression of Crf2 during A. fumigatus
infections
To verify that Crf2 is expressed by A. fumigatus during infection,
mice were infected with A. fumigatus strain D141, isolated from a
patient with an aspergillom [32], and the serum was used for an
epitope mapping on Crf1 and Crf2 (Fig. 3A). Three epitopes were
detected on both proteins (Fig. 3B). One continuous epitope
(NSSAEPTAAVLAF) identified on Crf2 is specific for Crf2 and
not part of Crf1, Asp f9 (also shown in the alignment) or Asp f16
(not shown in the aligment, due to frameshifts compared to Crf1,
Crf2 and Asp f9). Thus, Crf2 was expressed by two different
clinical isolates during infection.
An epitope mapping was also performed for Asp f16. Here, only
epitopes were detected which are in the amino acid segments of
Asp f16 identical to Crf1. No epitopes were detected where Asp
f16 is different to Crf1 (data not show).
Immunization of macaques and generation of an
immune antibody gene library
The procedure of immunization, library cloning, selection of
antibodies and screening is given in figure 4. A male macaque was
immunized with recombinant Crf2. After four antigen injections,
the Crf2 specific antibody titre measured by ELISA was equal to
1:256,000. Antibody fragment PCR products amplified from the
obtained bone marrow cDNA were cloned in pGemT, resulting in
a VH sub-library consisting of 6.26105 independent clones and a
VL sub-library of 1.66105 clones. The scFv libraries were
constructed in pHAL14 by two consecutive cloning steps, starting
with the VH gene fragments, followed by the VL fragmenst. The
final scFv antibody gene library consisted of 1.56107 independent
clones with 80% full size inserts. The anti-Crf2 immune library
was packaged with Hyperphage and showed a sufficient scFv
surface presentation on phage, as determined by SDS-PAGE,
Western blot and anti-pIII immunostain (Fig. 5). Two scFv::pIII
fusion proteins were detected, as described before [34,33].
Isolation of recombinant antibodies against Crf2
In addition to the anti-Crf2 macaque immune library, the
human naive antibody gene library HAL4/7 [35] was used for the
isolation of recombinant antibodies against the recombinant Crf2
protein. Both antibody gene libraries were screened with two
different panning strategies. In the first panning strategy,
immunostripes were coated with recombinant Crf2. In the second
strategy, the library was preincubated with in vivo biotinylated
recombinant Crf2 in solution which was captured using strepta￾vidin beads. After panning, individual clones were isolated and
monoclonal scFv antibody fragments were produced in MTPs. To
identify binders, the culture supernatants of the scFv clones were
directly used for antigen ELISA using either Crf2 directly coated
on Maxisorp microtitre plates (Nunc), when clones were isolated
by the first panning strategy, or biotinylated Crf2 bound on
streptavidin microtitre plates (Nunc) when the second panning
strategy was used. Afterwards, monoclonal binders were analysed
by DNA sequencing to exclude identical clones. As expected, more
unique binders were isolated from the macaque immune library as
from the naive human antibody gene library. In comparison to the
panning strategy with biotinylated Crf2 in solution, the panning
strategy using Crf2 coated immunostripes (microtitre wells)
resulted in more primary hits but the number of unique scFv
clones was the same (Table 1).
The unique scFvs were analysed for their variable immunoglo￾buline gene segments using VBASE2 (www.vbase2.org) [36]
(Table 2). The selected scFvs isolated from the naive antibody
gene library were very different in respect of the VH and VL
genes. In contrast, the scFv isolated from the immune antibody
gene library had only two different VH genes associated with
different VL genes. Interestingly, the VL gene of MS130i-IIIC3
was most similiar to a murine VL germline gene.

The similarity to human germline genes of the VH and VL genes
(germinality index) of the anti-Crf2 scFvs was calculated according
to Pelat et al. [37] indicated by percental identity of the VH or VL
framework region to the most similar human germline gene
identified by VBASE2 (Table 2). As expected, the VH and VL of the
scFvs derived from the human naive antibody gene library HAL4/7
had a higher identity to human germline genes than the V regions of
the scFvs from the macaque immune antibody gene library.
Immunoblot analysis of the anti-Crf2 scFvs
The binding of the selected unique anti-Crf2 scFvs to denatured
Crf2 was analysed by immunoblot. Crf2 was separated by SDS￾PAGE, followed by immunoblot using anti-Crf2 scFv and the
corresponding secondary antibodies (Table 3). Here, the panning
strategies yielded different results. All Crf2 specific scFvs obtained
by panning in immunostripes bound only to denatured Crf2, i. e.
to linear epitopes, whereas all scFvs selected by panning in solution
bound only to conformational epitopes. These results were
independent from the origin of the scFv from either an immune
or naive antibody gene library.
Binding of the scFv antibodies to A. fumigatus hyphae
The binding of the selected antibody fragments to native Crf2 on
A. fumigatus hyphae and spores was analysed by immunofluorescence

microscopy. For this purpose, the scFvs were recloned into the
mammalia expression vector pCMV-hIgG1-Fc-XP [33] to convert
them into the IgG-like bivalent scFv-Fc antibody format. The scFv￾Fc fusion proteins were transiently produced in HEK293T cells and
purified by protein A affinity chromatography.
One day after germination, spores and growing hyphae of A.
fumigatus, other Aspergillus species (A. terreus, A. nidulans, A. flavus, A.
clavatus) and the human pathogen Candida albicans were immobi￾lized on poly L-lysine coated cover slips, fixed and stained with
anti-Crf2 scFv-Fc fusion proteins and the corresponding secondary
antibodies and examined by brightfield and fluorescence micros￾copy. The staining of A. fumigatus for all analysed scFv-Fc clones
(Fig. 6A) revealed a pattern on the cell surface on the cell surface,
restricted to the growing part of the hyphae. Spores were not
stained. Seven of the analysed scFv-Fc fusion proteins bound
specifically to A. fumigatus and did not bind any other Aspergillus
species or C. albicans (Fig. 6B, shown for MS112-IIB1). These
antibody clones were not only able to bind Crf2 or an other crf1
gene product in its native conformation on cells but also allowed
the discrimination of A. fumigatus from related Aspergillus species.
Several of the antibodies identified to recognize linear epitopes
bound to native Crf2 on cells.
Characterization of anti-Crf2 scFvs by titration ELISA
The scFv clones which bound to native Crf2 on A. fumigatus were
further characterized by titration ELISA on biotinylated Crf2
coated on streptavidin plates (Fig. 7A). The scFv clones MS112-
IIA1, MS112-IIBI, MS130i-IIIC3 and MS130i-IID7 showed half
maximal antigen binding in low concentrations of ,100–200 ng/
mL and the clones MS130h-IIIC2, MS130i-IIIG3 and MS130i￾IIB6 at ,1 mg/mL, respectively. The antibody fragments
MS130i-IIF4 and MS130iIIF6 bound only in high concentrations
around 5 mg/mL. If the antigen was directly coated to the plastic
surface of Maxisorp plates, a higher scFv concentration was
required to reach half maximal antigen binding in the ELISA.
Moreover, three scFv clones (MS-130i-IIIG3, MS130i-IIF4,
MS130i-IIF6) showed nearly no binding on Crf2 when it was
directly coated in Maxisorp plates (Fig. 7B).
Determination of the affinity of anti-Crf2 scFvs by surface
plasmon resonance (SPR)
The affinity of the scFvs which bound to native Crf2 and all
scFvs derived from panning in solution was determined by surface
plasmon resonance. Biacore measurements for MS130i-IIIC3 and
MS130i-IIIG3 are exemplarily given in Fig. 8 and all other results
are summarized in Table 3. The scFvs MS112-IIB1 and MS130i￾IIIC3 bound with subnanomolar affinity to Crf2. The other
analysed scFvs bound with affinities between KD 1027
–1029 M.
Analysis of the stability of anti-Crf2 scFvs
The scFv clones which were specific for the native Crf2 were
further analysed to evaluate their stability, an important feature of
antibodies for potential diagnostic or therapeutic applications.
Therefore, the scFvs were incubated in PBS, human serum or
inactivated human serum respectively for 0 (control) to 27 days at
37uC. Crf2 binding activity was evaluated by antigen ELISA
(Fig. 9, Table 3). The half life was longer for the scFv clones
MS112-IIA1, MS112-IIB1 and MS130i-IIIC3 when incubated in
serum compared to the incubation in PBS, whereas for the clone
MS130i-IID7 the half life in PBS was better. The most stable scFv
is MS130h-IIIC2 originated from the human naive antibody gene
library with 60% Crf2 binding activity after 27 days of incubation
at 37uC, independent of the incubation medium.
Determination of the detection limit of recombinant Crf2
in spiked human serum
For diagnostic purposes, the detection limits of the scFvs which
bound native Crf2 in solution were evaluated. Here, scFvs were
coated to the plastic surface of Maxisorp microtitre plates to capture
biotinylated Crf2 diluted in different concentrations in human
serum (Fig. 10). Four scFvs (MS130i-IIIC3, MS130h-IIIC2,
MS112-IIA1, MS112-IIB1) were able to detect Crf2 in serum and
therefore are candidates for a future diagnostic assay. The estimated

Discussion
The specificity and sensitivity of IA - caused by A. fumigatus - assays
has to be improved to allow optimal and early antifungal treatment
with antimycotics [18,5,19]. Initially, we intended to generate
recombinant antibodies against the well-characterized A. fumigatus
antigens Asp f9 and Asp f16/Crf [22–24,27]. Therefore, we tried to
isolated the cDNA of the corresponding transcripts to obtain
recombinant antigens for the generation of recombinant human
antibodies against their gene products. Both asp f9 and asp f16 are
splicing variants of the crf gene [22]. However, we were not able the
isolate asp f16 cDNA with specific primers from a clinical sample of a
patient diagnosed with invasive infection of an A. fumigatus strain.
Despite the fact that Asp f16 was successfully used as recombinant
protein for active immunizations of mice which even protected them
against IA [23,28], the existence of asp f16 as splicing variant is at least
doubtful [29] as supported by epitope mapping results in this study.
Instead of the asp f16 cDNA, a related cDNA was isolated from the
patient sample. The new transcript was named crf2 according its
parental gene crf1 [31] which is also referred as crf. The new crf2,
which is lacking a significant part of the 39 end of crf1, is hypothesized
to be a splicing variant of crf1. However, by bioinformatic analysis
using Signal P [38] no splicing sites were found on these positions.
Mice sera obtained after A. fumigatus infection bound to an epitope
consisting of a sequence covering both ends of the potential splicing
site, thus proving the existence of this gene product. Interestingly, this
epitope is not part of Crf1, Asp f9 or Asp f16. Therefore, Crf2 was
expressed by two different clinical isolates during infection.
In the further study, we focused on the generation of
recombinant antibodies by antibody phage display against the
novel A. fumigatus antigen Crf2. Antibody phage display is an in vitro
technology to select recombinant antibodies against nearly any
target for research, diagnostic and therapy [40–43,39]. In this
work, recombinant scFv antibody fragments were selected against
Crf2 using two antibody gene libraries. Antibody fragments were
isolated from the human naive antibody gene library HAL4/7
[33,35] and an immune antibody gene library constructed from a
macaque immunized with recombinant Crf2 protein. ScFvs were
selected from both antibody gene libraries using two different
panning protocols: First, the panning with recombinant Crf2
directly coated onto the plastic surface in immunostripes and
second, the panning in solution with in vivo biotinylated
recombinant Crf2 followed by pull down with streptavidin
conjugated magnetic beads. Most Crf2 specific antibody fragments
isolated from the human naive library bound to linear epitopes of
Crf2, only one scFv antibody clone obtained by panning in
solution recognized native Crf2. The macaque immune antibody
gene library was expected to contain a larger number of Crf2-
specific antibodies that also recognize native Crf2 because the
macaque showed a high serum titre of Crf2-specific antibodies
after immunization. The number of unique scFv antibody clones
was slightly higher, but the impact of the panning strategy was
even more significant. The panning using recombinant Crf2
directly coated on the plastic surface of immunostripes only led to
the isolation of scFvs which bound to linear epitopes, whereas the
strategy using in vivo biotinylated Crf2 in solution led to the
isolation of scFvs which exclusively bound to conformational
epitopes. The direct coating of proteins can lead to a partial
denaturation [44], which can explain the selection of scFv
antibody clones binding only to linear epitopes of Crf2. In vivo

Novel Aspergillus Antigen Crf2
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 7 August 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 8 | e6625

biotinylated Crf2 is not expected to be denatured in solution. The
pull down with streptavidin coupled magnetic beads should not
harm the conformation of Crf2. As expected, the selected
macaque VHs or VLs showed a slightly lower identity to human
germline genes as the human variable domains. For future
therapeutic purposes, e.g. passive immunization, the macaque
antibodies can be superhumanized if neccessary [37].
The selected scFvs were converted into the bivalent scFv-Fc
antibody format and analyzed for their the binding to A. fumigatus,
related Aspergillus species and the clinically relevant C. albicans. All
analysed scFv-Fc proteins that recognized conformational epitopes
were able to specifically bind to A. fumigatus. These antibodies bound
obviously to the native conformation of Crf2 but binding to other Crf
splicing variants is not excluded. In contrast to the scFv clones that
recognized conformational Crf2 epitopes, only two of eight scFv-Fc
proteins with the specificity for linear Crf2 epitopes also bound to A.
fumigatus. The immunofluorescence staining showed that the anti￾Crf2 scFv-Fc antibodies bound to the cell wall region of the growing
hyphae. This is in accordance with publications showing that
glycosylhydrolases/glycosyltranferases of the Crh and Gas family -
Crf belongs to this group - are involved in the cell wall construction
[22,45,46]. All generated scFv-Fcs bound specifically to A. fumigatus
and not to other analysed pathogenic Aspergillus species or C. albicans.
Therefore, these scFv-Fc promise to allow a specific histopatholog￾ical identification of A. fumigatus. Immunofluorescence staining of
histopathological samples of IA patients has already been described
to be feasible for the detection of A. fumigatus [47].
In respect of a possible diagnostic application, the antibody clones
that specifically bound to A. fumigatus were further characterized.
Two different types of a dilution ELISA were performed and
compared. In the first ELISA, in vivo biotinylated Crf2 was coupled
to streptavidin coated microtitre plate wells, whereas in the second
ELISA Crf2 was directly coated onto the plastic surface of Maxisorp
microtitre plate wells. In general, scFv clones recognizing the native
Crf2 bound better to streptavidin captured biotinylated Crf2 than to
directly coated Crf2. Furthermore, three scFv clones which
recognize conformational Crf2 epitopes did not bind to Crf2 coated
on the plastic surface at all. This result also suggests that Crf2
becomes at least partially denatured after coating on plastic surfaces.
This partial denaturation of proteins by immobilization [44] is only
rarely described. It should be kept in mind when choosing the
appropriate panning or assay protocols.
The affinity of the scFvs was determined by SPR. The scFv
clone MS130h-IIIC2 from the naive human antibody gene library
has an affinity of 1028 M which is expected for isolated antibody
fragments from large naive libraries by phage display [48]. In
contrast, scFvs isolated from the macaque immune antibody gene
library had affinities of up to 10210 M.
The serum stability of the anti-Crf2 scFvs was very different
among the individual clones and half life at 37uC ranged from less
than one day to more than 27 days. The stability of one clone
isolated from the human naı¨ve antibody gene library and one clone
of the macaque immune antibody gene library were exceptionally
high. Here, the antigen binding activity only decreased by 20–30%
after 27 days. In contrast, other publications showed half lives for
scFvs at 37uC of less then one day to more than 6 days [49–51].
The human serum spiking experiment with a dilution series of
biotinylated Crf2 established a detection limit to only 2 or 5 ng/

mL recombinant Crf2. The results recommends these scFvs for a
diagnostic detection of Crf2 in serum samples from patients with
suspected IA. A Crf2 sandwich ELISA may improve and facilitate
a reliable and early diagnosis of IA. Common A. fumigatus diagnosis
assays like GM or BG assay are not specific for A. fumigatus,
because other Aspergillus species and Candida are also detected.
Furthermore, they are not very sensitive, e.g. the GM assay has a
higher sensitivity for IA caused by other Aspergillus species and lead
to many false positive results [5]. On the other hand the GM assay
also detects IA caused by other Aspergillus species and other
mycoses. Because of the side effect of antimycotics [10,11] and the
cost of the treatment of up to 20,000J per patient [52,53] a
specific and reliable detection of A. fumigatus can improve the
therapy and reduce costs.
The diagnosis and treatment of IA may benefit from the use of
this novel antigen and the new antibody assay for its detection.

were cloned into the NheI/NotI site of the expression vector
pET21a(+) (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) resulting in the
vectors pET21a-Crf2 and pET21a-Aspf9a.
A bacterial expression vector for the in vivo biotinylation was
constructed by hybridization of oligonucleotide primers encoding
the gene fragment of the biotin acceptor domain (BAD) [55] and
cloned into the XbaI/NheI site of pET21a-Crf2 vector resulting in
the vector pET21a-Crf2-BAD. Transformations of XL1-Blue
MRF’ (Stratagene, Amsterdam, Netherlands) with these constructs
were done by electroporation according to the manufacturers
instructions. All affected regions of the constructs were comfirmed
by DNA sequencing using an ABI Prism 310 sequencer.
Immunization of mice
Female C57/Bl.6 mice (8–10 weeks old) used for the infection
experiments were purchased from Harlan-Winkelmann (Borchen,
Germany). Mice were intranasally inoculated with 30 ml of
conidial suspension of Aspergillus strain D141, isolated from an
aspergilloma patient [32], containing 56106 viable conidia. Blood
was taken 7 days after infection from the retro-orbital sinus and
serum was separated by centrifugation in BD Microtainer Tubes
(BD Biosciences). After centrifugation the tubes were frozen at
220uC until tested by ELISA.
Epitope Mapping
The protein sequence of Crf1, Crf2 and Asp f16 was divided
into overlapping peptide fragments, each consisting of 15 amino
acids, with an offset of three amino acids. This array of peptides
was synthesized by the SPOT technique [56,57] on an
aminopegylated cellulose membrane (AIMS Scientific Products
GmbH, Wolfenbu¨ttel, Germany) as described previously [58].
Peptides are N-terminally acetylated and remain covalently
attached to the membrane via their carboxy-terminus. The
membrane bound peptide array was probed with serum of A.
fumigatus infected mice for binding according to established
procedures [58].
Production of Crf2 in E. coli
For the production of Crf2 and biotinylated Crf2 the E.coli
strain BLR(DE3) (Novagen) was transformed with the vector
pET21a-Crf2 or cotransformed with pET21a-Crf2-BAD and the
helper plasmid pRARE3 encoding the biotin ligase and rare
tRNAs (Zoltan Konthur, Max Planck institute for molecular
genetics, Berlin, Germany). Briefly, 1000 mL 2xTY [59]+100 mg/
mL glucose+100 mg/mL ampicillin, respectively adding 1 mM
biotin, were inoculated with an overnight culture yield to
O.D.600,0.1 and cultured at 37uC and 250 rpm. The induction
was started by addition of 1 mM IPTG at O.D.600= 0.7 followed
by cultivation for 5 h. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation
for 10 min at 44006g at RT. Pellets were resuspended in 30 mL
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) [59] and sonicated (Sonotrode
MS72, Bandelin, Berlin, Germany). The resuspended cells were
centrifuged for 10 min at 44006g and the supernatant was
filtrated using a 0.45 mm filter (Sartorius, Go¨ttingen, Germany),
before IMAC and IEC purification.
Immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) and
Ion exchange chromatography (IEC) purification of Crf2
Crf2 was purified from E. coli derived material by IMAC affinity
chromatography using A¨ kta Prime (GE Healthcare, Mu¨nchen,
Germany) and a His Trap FF crude column (GE Healthcare)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The elution was
performed using an imidazol gradient and the Crf2 containing
elution fractions were dialysed over night against 5 L 20 mM

TrisHCl, pH 8. Further purification by IEC was performed using
a Resource Q (GE Healthcare) column, Crf2 was eluted using a
NaCl gradient and dialysed against PBS.
Immunization of macaques
A cynomolgus macaque (Macaca fascicularis) was immunized with
Crf2, injected (200 mg per injection) subcutaneously with complete
Freud adjuvant (Sigma, first boost) followed by incomplete Freud
adjuvant. In total four boost were performed at day 19, 38, 66 and 77.
Construction of the anti-Crf2 antibody gene library
Total bone marrow (around 5 ml) was sampled after the last
boost to isolate RNA using Tri Reagent (Molecular Research
Center Inc., Cincinnati, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. RNA was isolated, reverse transcribed with oligo(dT)
into cDNA and amplified with primers specific for the DNA
coding macaque Fd and VLk as formerly published [60].
PCR products were cloned in the pGemT vector (Promega,
Madison, Wisconsin) according to the manufacturer’s instructions,
yielding two antibody genes sub-libraries encoding the heavy
chains (Fd fragment) or the kappa light chains. The pGemT
cloned PCR products were reamplified using two oligucleotide
primer sets to introduce restriction sites for library cloning. A set of
macaque kappa oligonucleotide primers was used as forward
oligonucleotide primers and reverse oligonucleotide primers [61].
The secondary PCRs were carried out for each forward
oligonucleotide primers separately to keep the diversity. Each
PCR was performed in a volume of 100 ml using 100 ng purified
PCR reaction product of the pGemT cloned cDNA, 4 U Red Taq
polymerase (Sigma, Hamburg, Germany), 200 mM dNTPs each
and 200 nM of each oligonucleotide primer for 20 cycles (30 s
94uC, 30 s 57uC, 30 s 72uC), followed by 10 min 72uC. The PCR
products were separated by 1,5% (w/v) agarose gel, cut out and
purified using Nucleospin Extract II Kit (Macherey-Nagel, Du¨ren,
Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The construction of the library was done in two subsequent
steps. First, the VH PCR products were cloned to pHAL14 as
described [35,34,61] followed by a second cloning step to insert
the VL PCR fragments. A total of 5 mg pHAL14 and 2 mg VH
were digested using 50 U HindIII and 50 U NcoI (NEB, Frankfurt,
Germany) in a 100 ml reaction volume for 2 h at 37uC. The
enzyme reaction was inactived for 10 min at 65uC. Afterwards,
0.5 U calf intestinal phosphatase (MBI Fermentas) was added and
incubated for further 30 min. This dephosphorylation step was
repeated once. The vector was purified using the Nucleospin
Extract II Kit. 270 ng VH were cloned into 1 mg of the
dephosporylated pHAL14 using 1 U ligase (Promega, Mannheim,
Germany) overnight at 16uC. The ligation reactions were
precipitated with ethanol and sodium acetate and the pellet was
washed twice with 70% ethanol. These reactions were electropo￾rated (1.7 kV) in 25 ml XL1-Blue MRF’ (Stratagene, Amsterdam,
Netherlands). The transformed bacteria were plated onto 2xYT
agar plates (25 cm petri dishes) supplemented with 100 mg/mL
ampicillin and 100 mM glucose. The colonies were harvested by
suspending in 40 mL 2xYT media with a Drigalsky spatula.
Plasmids were isolated using the Nucleobond Plasmid Midi Kit
(Macherey-Nagel) according to the manufactors instructions. 5 mg
of each VH chain library as well as 1,5 mg of the VL fragments
were digested using 50 U NotI and 50 U MulI (NEB) in a 100 ml
reaction volume overnight at 37uC. The following steps were
performed as described for VH with the following modification:
250 ng of the digested and purified VL repertoire was used for
ligation. In total 2 transformations were performed and pooled.
The harvested bacteria representing the final antibody gene
libraries were aliquoted and stored at 280uC.
Selection of recombinant antibodies using
immunostripes or magnetic beads
The selection of recombinant antibodies using microtitre plates/
immunostripes is described by Hust et al. 2007 [39]. A total of
100 ng Crf2 was coated for the first panning round and second
panning round per well and 10 ng Crf2 was coated for the last
panning round.
For the panning in solution using streptavidin magnetic beads,
two separate samples of 5 mL M280 beads (Dynal, Oslo, Norway)
were preincubated in PBS with 1% (w/v) BSA and 1% (w/v) skim
milk for 1.5 h at RT. All incubation steps were performed in an
overhead shaker. The beads were captured using a magnetic
separator (Dynal) and washed with PBS. One sample of the
blocked beads was incubated with 161011 phage particles of the
antibody gene libraries in 700 mL PBS with 1% (w/v) BSA and
1% (w/v) skim milk for 1.5 hours at RT and unspecific binder are
removed using a magnetic separator. The supernatant with the
residual library was incubated with 100 ng biotinylated Crf2 for
1.5 hours at RT followed by an incubation with the second sample
of blocked streptavidin magnetic beads for another 20 min. The
beads with the bound antibody phage were captured by pull down
in a magnetic separator. The beads were washed 20 times with
PBS. The elution of the bound scFv phage particles with trypsin
and the reamplification of the scFv phage were done as described
for panning in MTPs by Hust et al. 2007 [39].
Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
For the detection of anti-Crf2 antibodies by ELISA, recombinant
Crf2 antigen was coated to 96 well microtitre plates (Maxisorp,
Nunc) in PBS overnight at 4uC. To evaluate effects caused by partial
denaturation of the antigen, biotinylated Crf2 was bound to 96 well
streptavidin microtitre plates (Streptavidin F96 Clear, Nunc) in a
parallel approach. To detect Crf2 antigen by ELISA, purified Crf2-
specific scFvs were coated to Maxisorp plates in PBS at 4uC
overnight. After coating, the wells were washed three times with
PBST and blocked with 2% (w/v) skim milk powder in PBST
(2%M-PBST) for 1.5 h at RT, followed by three washing steps with
PBST. For the antigen ELISA soluble scFvs were diluted in 100 mL
2%M-PBST and incubated in the Crf2 coated plates for 1.5 h at
RT followed by three times PBST washing cycles. For the antigen
capture ELISA, the biotinylated Crf2 antigen was diluted in 100 mL
2%M-PBST and incubated with the capture antibody for 1.5 h
followed by three washing steps with PBST. Bound scFvs were
detected with the murine mAb 9E10 which recognizes the c￾terminal c-myc tag and a goat anti-mouse Ab conjugated with
horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Sigma; 1:10,000). Captured bioti￾nylated Crf2 was detected with 1 mg/mL streptavidin conjugated
with HRP. The visualization was performed with TMB (3,39,5,59-
tetramethylbenzidine) as substrate and the staining reaction was
stopped by adding 100 ml 1 N sulphuric acid. Absorbance at
450 nm was measured by using a SUNRISETM microtitre plate
reader (Tecan, Crailsheim, Germany).
SDS-PAGE and Immunoblot
Crf2 or scFv proteins were analysed by 12% SDS-PAGE.
Protein gels were stained with coomassie blue or blotted onto a
PVDF membrane. The membrane was blocked with 2%M-PBST
for 1 h at RT. The detection of Crf2 was performed using mouse
anti-his tag (1:5,000), the detection of scFvs was performed using
mouse mAb 9E10 (anti-myc tag) (1:500) and detected with a goat

anti-mouse antibody conjugated to AP (Sigma, Taufkirchen,
Germany) (1:10,000). The staining was performed using NBT/
BCIP substrate.
Cloning and production of scFv-Fc fusion proteins
The recloning of anti-Crf2 scFvs into pCMV-hIgG1-Fc-XP and
the transient production in HEK293T was performed as described
before [33].
Cultivation of fungi and immunofluorescence
microscopy
A. fumigatus (clinical isolate D141) [32] and A. flavus (DSM818,
Deutsche Stammsammlung fu¨r Mikroorganismen DSMZ,
Braunschweig, Germany) were cultivated in potato dextrose
medium according to DSM at 27uC. Aspergillus terreus
(DSM1958) and A. nidulans (Emericella nidulans, DSM970) were
cultivated in potato dextrose medium at 37uC. Aspergillus clavatus
(DSM3410) was cultivated in Czapek-Dox medium according to
DSM at 27uC and C. albicans (DSM3454) was cultivated in
universal medium for yeasts (YM) according to DSM at 27uC.
Subsequently, the spores were harvested and 4.5 mL RPMI 1640
medium [62] without fetal calf serum (FCS) was inoculated with
,56104 spores. The spore solution was cultivated in 12 well plates
(Greiner Bio-One, Essen, Germany) on poly L-lysine coated cover
slips (Menzel-Gla¨ser, Braunschweig, Germany) for one day at
37uC. The medium was removed and the the cover slips were
washed three times with PBS.
The cover slips were blocked with 250 mL blocking solution (3%
(w/v) BSA, 2% (w/v) skimmed milk powder and 0.05% (v/v)
Tween 20 in PBS) for 1.5 h. A total of 250 mL scFv-Fc fusion
protein with a final concentration of 2 mg/mL in blocking solution
was incubated for 1.5 h and washed three times with PBS. The
scFv-Fc fusion proteins were detected with 250 mL goat anti￾human IgG (Fc specific) conjugated to Alexa 488 (1:500 in
blocking solution) for 1.5 h in the dark and washed three times
with dH2O. The fungi were fixed with 10 mL Mowiol (Roth,
Karlsruhe, Germany) and dryed overnight at RT in the dark.
An Axiovert 200 (Carl Zeiss, Germany) was used for
fluorescence and bright field microscopy with 636magnification
and 1.0 gain for fluorescence or 0.002 gain for brightfield
microscopy, respectively. All images were analyzed with the
software LSM Image browser (Carl Zeiss, Germany).
Surface plasmon resonance
The surface plasmon resonance was performed using Biacore
2000 according to the Biacore manual. Briefly, about 200 RU
recombinant Crf2 were coupled in 10 mM sodium acetate buffer
pH 4.0 on a CM5 chip. For reference, 200 RU BSA were coupled
in 10 mM sodium acetate buffer pH 4.5. Serial dilutions of scFv
(0 nM–400 nM) were measured at flow rate of 50 mL/min. The
chip was regenerated with 100 mM glycine buffer pH 2.5. The
data fitting was performed using 1:1 Langmuir separate fitting
algorithm of the Biaevalution software.
ScFv stability analysis
The scFvs were aliquoted as triplicates in 100 mL (5 mg/mL in
PBS or human serum) in 2 mL microtubes (Sarstedt, Nu¨rnbrecht,
Germany) and stored at 280uC. Every three days and every day
for the last two samples, an aliquot was thawed and transferred
into a 37uC incubator. All samples were analyzed at the same day
in the same antigen ELISA using biotinylated Crf2 as antigen
bound to streptavidin microtitre plates (Nunc). A total of 80 mL of
the scFv solutions was analysed by antigen ELISA.
