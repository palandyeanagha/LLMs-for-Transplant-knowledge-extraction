Abstract
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a well-known cause of acute hepatitis. Immunocompromised sub￾jects, including liver transplant recipients, are considered to be at risk for HEV infection,
which occasionally follows a chronic course. The diagnosis of HEV infection in these patients
must be based on HEV RNA testing, as serology has variable performance. The aim of this
study was to assess the prevalence of HEV infection in liver transplant recipients in Greece
by means of HEV RNA testing. Liver transplant recipients followed in the sole transplant cen￾tre in Greece were prospectively included. HEV RNA was detected by real-time RT-PCR.
Positive samples were further analysed using a nested reverse transcription RT-PCR kit,
which amplifies a 137-nucleotide sequence within the ORF2/ORF3 overlapping region to
detect the HEV genotype and perform phylogenetic analysis. The mean age of the included
patients (n = 76) was 54 years. The most common indication for liver transplantation was
viral hepatitis (57%). The majority of the patients (75%) received a calcineurin inhibitor as
part of their immunosuppressive regimen and had normal liver enzymes. HEV RNA was
found positive in only 1/76 (1.3%) patient. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the sequence
clustered into the HEV genotype 3 clade. This patient experienced an acute hepatitis flare,
which nonetheless did not become chronic. The prevalence of HEV infection in liver trans￾plant recipients in Greece is similar (1.3%) to that reported previously in other countries.
Transplant physicians should be aware of this condition and its associated consequences.
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a major cause of acute viral hepatitis, causing approximately 50% of
acute hepatitis cases in developing countries. According to the World Health Organization
(WHO), approximately one-third of the world population has been exposed to HEV [1].
The main source of HEV transmission in developed countries is the consumption of raw or
undercooked infected meat or the direct contact with infected animals, whereas cases of blood￾borne transmission have also been reported [2].
Immunocompromised subjects, including liver transplant recipients, are considered to be at
risk for HEV infection [3]. They can be infected via the faecal–oral route and through admin￾istration of blood products and theoretically via the transplant organ itself. Of note, HEV
infection in liver transplant recipients may pose diagnostic difficulties as the serological assays
have serious limitations in their sensitivity and specificity [4]. In addition, it can have a chronic
course leading to cirrhosis.
Prevalence data (ranging from 3% up to 23%) for HEV infection in liver transplant recipi￾ents from different countries were summarised in a recent comprehensive review [4]. Various
diagnostic methods were used in these studies, including HEV RNA detection, although most
of the studies relied on the detection of anti-HEV IgG. Data about HEV infection in Greece are
very limited. A study has estimated that the seroprevalence of hepatitis E in the general popu￾lation in Greece is approximately 7% [5]. However, no information was up to now available
regarding its prevalence in liver transplant recipients.
The aim of this cross-sectional study was to assess the prevalence of HEV infection in liver
transplant recipients in Greece by prospectively assessing the serum HEV RNA.
We prospectively included data from consecutive liver transplant recipients followed in the
liver transplant centre in Thessaloniki, Greece from December 2016 to March 2017. All
patients in our centre had received cadaveric transplants and they were evaluated routinely
every 3 months. Demographic, laboratory data and information on immunosuppressive regi￾mens for all patients were recorded. The study was approved by our institutional review board.
Complete blood counts and biochemistries were determined by routine laboratory meth￾ods. RNA was extracted from patient’s serum samples by QIAamp Viral Mini kit (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany) and HEV RNA was detected by real-time RT-PCR (Hepatitise2@

ceeramTools kit, Applied Biosystems ABI) according to the man￾ufactures’ instructions once for each patient. This method detects
as few as five genome copies of HEV per reaction. A nested
RT-PCR, which amplifies a 137-nucleotide sequence within the
ORF2/ORF3 overlapping region, was applied for positive samples
to detect the HEV genotype [6]. Since the amplicons of ORF2/
3-137 PCR contain variable sequences, phylogenetic analysis
was also performed [7]. In addition, follow-up RNA testing was
performed for positive samples as clinically indicated.
Data for 76 patients were analysed in this study. The median
age of our patients was 54 years and most of them were males
(n = 58, 76%). The most common indication for liver transplant￾ation was decompensated cirrhosis due to viral hepatitis (n = 43,
57%). The median interval from the date of transplantation to
the enrolment in our study was 98.5 months (15–341). The
majority of the patients (75%) received a calcineurin inhibitor
as part of their immunosuppressive regimen and had normal
liver enzymes. Positive HEV RNA was detected in only one
patient (prevalence 1.3%, 95% CI 0.00–3.90). Phylogenetic ana￾lysis for this patient showed that the sequence clustered into the
HEV genotype 3 clade (Fig. 1).
This was a 60-year-old male patient who was transplanted due
to alcoholic cirrhosis, 7 months prior to HEV detection. The
recipient was discharged 40 days after transplantation in good
clinical condition and with normal liver enzymes. His immuno￾suppressive regimen at that time included steroids, cyclosporine
and mycophenolate mofetil. However, a sharp increase in his
liver enzymes was noted 3 months after his discharge. A liver
biopsy indicated acute cellular rejection and at the same time
an inflammatory process compatible with viral infection.
Notably, serology for hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus and cyto￾megalovirus was negative for an acute infection. Rejection was
treated with steroids leading to the gradual decrease of his liver
enzymes. However, they remained elevated for the following 2
months. Thus, an enhancement of his immunosuppressive regi￾men was decided by replacing cyclosporine with tacrolimus. At
that time point, HEV RNA was pending and was retrospectively
found to be positive when the patient was evaluated in the context
of our study. Patient’s liver enzyme levels finally returned to nor￾mal approximately 4 months after the initial rise without any spe￾cific medication for HEV infection. At that point, HEV RNA was
not detectable any more.
Discussion
It was not until the last decade that it became evident that HEV
infection can affect liver transplant recipients causing a progres￾sive disease that can lead to liver cirrhosis. The first description
of such cases was made exactly 10 years ago in a case series of
transplant recipients, including three liver recipients. Notably,
all three liver transplant recipients in that study had a chronic
clinical course [8]. After that initial report, a number of similar
cases have been described from all around the world [9–12].
The overall reported prevalence in most studies was low ranging
from 1% to 3%. During the recent years, it also became apparent
that the diagnosis of HEV infection in transplant recipients must
be based on HEV RNA testing as serology has variable perform￾ance. As this is a recently acknowledged topic, any added infor￾mation that is based on the correct methodology will enhance
the understanding of this infection and will consequently facilitate
its effective management.
In the present study, we report data on HEV infection preva￾lence in liver transplant recipients in Greece based on HEV RNA
detection. We found only one HEV RNA-positive subject in a
cohort of 76 liver transplant recipients followed in one centre.
As this is the sole transplant centre in Greece, it is conceivable
that our results reflect the national prevalence of HEV in liver
transplant recipients. The HEV prevalence in Greece (1.3%)
seems to be similar to that reported in other countries previously
[9–12].
HEV infection can be diagnosed serologically with the detec￾tion of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG)
antibodies. Unfortunately, the performance of the relevant assays
is variable and can often mislead the physician [13]. One of the
most important problems, especially in the setting of immuno￾suppression, is the lack of sensitivity of IgM antibodies. In

addition, the IgG antibodies often become positive with a signifi￾cant delay and furthermore do not remain positive for a long per￾iod of time. Currently, the use of commercially available HEV
RNA assays is the method of choice for the diagnosis of HEV
infection in immunosuppressed patients [4]. However, this still
remains an imperfect diagnostic method with substantial variabil￾ity, as well [14]. In our study, we based the diagnosis of HEV
infection only on HEV RNA detection using a real-time
RT-PCR kit. The inclusion of serology would have added import￾ant information to our findings and certainly constitutes a limita￾tion of our study. However, we elected to use only the most
reliable diagnostic method due to the lack of availability of sero￾logical tests in our centre and financial issues.
In our study, we identified one patient with positive HEV
RNA. Although the available data cannot support conclusively
the description of this case as chronic (duration of positive
HEV RNA for at least 3 months is warranted), his prolonged clin￾ical course with concurrent elevation of his liver tests suggest that
this was a definite case of HEV infection. Notably, this patient
had an infection with HEV genotype 3, which is the only geno￾type that is associated with chronicity among the four (1–4)
described genotypes. Genotypes 1 and 2 are responsible for
human infections exclusively, while genotypes 3 and 4 can infect
humans and other mammals [15]. There is evidence that HEV
genotype 3 can be transmitted through the ingestion of under￾cooked meat from infected animals, thereby highlighting the zoo￾notic nature of this infection. According to a detailed history, our
patient denied eating raw meat. He continuously lived in a semi￾rural area with no travel history abroad during the past few
months prior to his transplantation. Although the exact mode
of transmission in our patient was not evident, it is conceivable
that the most probable route was undercooked meat.
In conclusion, this is the first study to report the presence of
HEV in liver transplant recipients in Greece using HEV RNA
detection. The distribution of HEV seems to be global calling
for increased vigilance for its diagnosis. Physicians taking care
of liver transplant recipients should be aware of the possibility
of HEV infection of the graft since such an infection could poten￾tially become chronic and progress to advanced liver disease.
