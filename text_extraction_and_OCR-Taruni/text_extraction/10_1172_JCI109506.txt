A B S T R A C T Parameters of mineral and bone me￾tabolism were studied in 17 patients treated chronically
with supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids. When
compared to 15 matched normal subjects, the patient
group exhibited similar serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D
(25-OHD) levels, decreased intestinal 47Ca absorption,
increased serum immunoreactive parathyroid hor￾mone, and decreased forearm bone mass. Iliac crest
bone biopsies revealed a decreased bone formation
rate and increased osteoclast number. Treatment with
25-OHD (mean dose 40.3 ,ug/d) and calcium (500 mg/d)
in nine patients produced a 46% increase in 47Ca ab￾sorption (P < 0.001) and a 54% decrease in serum im￾munoreactive parathyroid hormone (P <0.001) by
3 mo. In addition, by 12 mo the treatment group ex￾hibited (a) a 13.2+5.1% increase in metaphyseal
(P < 0.001) and a 2.1+0.4% increase in diaphyseal
(P < 0.05) forearm bone mass, and (b) significant de￾creases in cortical and endosteal osteoclast number.
Biochemical and bone mass changes persisted through
18 mo. No significant changes in any parameter oc￾curred in eight control patients administered calcium
100 mgld. It is concluded that treatment with 25-OHD
and calcium can significantly improve parameters of
mineral and bone metabolism in patients with gluco￾corticoid-induced osteopenia.

origin, is commonly associated with the development
of severe osteopenia in man (1-6). Histologic studies
of bone in patients with steroid-induced osteopenia
have demonstrated both decreased formation rates
and increased numbers of osteoclasts and resorption
sites (7, 8). The decrease in formation rate has been
attributed to an inhibitory effect on osteoblast func￾tion. Moderate doses of glucocorticoids decrease
both the synthesis of collagen by preexisting osteo￾blasts and the recruitment of progenitor cells to func￾tioning osteoblasts (7-10). This reduced function
apparently represents a direct cellular effect since
the addition of cortisone to osteoblasts in culture
markedly reduces protein synthesis (10).
Steroid-induced increases in bone resorption rates
have been variously attributed to either direct stimu￾lation of osteoclast activity or increased parathyroid
hormone (PTH)1 secretion. However, glucocorticoids
do not directly stimulate bone resorption in vitro (11)
and parathyroidectomy abolishes the osteoclastic
response in animals (12). Moreover, it has been
recently demonstrated that chronic glucocorticoid ad￾ministration in man is associated with elevated serum
immunoreactive PTH (iPTH) concentrations (13-15)
which can be suppressed by calcium infusion (14).
Thus it appears likely that the increased bone resorp￾tive activity is due to an increase in PTH secretion
presumably secondary, at least in part, to inhibition
of intestinal calcium absorption (16-19).
The basis for the inhibitory effect of glucocorticoids
on intestinal calcium transport remains controversial.
Several authors have suggested that glucocorticoids

may reduce serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD)
concentration either by impairing the hepatic con￾version of vitamin D to 25-OHD or by altering sub￾sequent 25-OHD metabolism (19-21). In contrast,
others have reported normal conversion of [3H]vitamin
D3 to its active metabolites in cortisone-treated rats
(17, 22) and normal serum 25-OHD concentrations,
measured by competitive-protein binding assay, in
steroid-treated patients (23, 24). This question remains
unresolved; however, it has been reported that admin￾istration of vitamin D in doses of 50,000-100,000 U/wk
for 12 wk or 0.4 ,ug/d of 1,25-(OH)2D3 for 7 d significantly
increases intestinal calcium absorption in steroid￾treated patients (18, 19). This being the case, we hy￾pothesized that restoring intestinal calcium absorption
to normal levels in such patients by administering 25-
OHD and calcium supplements would suppress PTH￾induced increases in resorption rates, thereby favorably
affecting bone mineral status. The results of our studies
indicate that such a regimen does indeed produce a
substantial improvement in mineral metabolism
parameters.
METHODS
17 patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteopenia were
chosen for study. Criteria for the diagnosis included (a) treat￾ment with supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids (>7.5 mg
prednisone-equivalents/d) for a least 1.5 yr, (b) osteopenia
detectable by routine radiographic techniques, and (c) a
characteristic disproportionately greater loss of metaphyseal
relative to diaphyseal bone mass in the radius as determined
by our previously described photon absorption technique (6).
Criteria for inclusion in the study included (a) relatively stable
glucocorticoid dose (<25% change in dose over the preceding
6 mo), (b) a creatinine clearance of >80 ml/min per 1.73 m2,
(c) normal liver function tests, and (d) evidence of normal
intestinal fat absorption including absence of symptoms of
intestinal malabsorption, a normal serum carotene, a normal
D-xylose test, and absence of increased fat on routine stool
specimens. Specifically excluded from study were patients
who had been maintained on medications known or suspected
to alter bone mineral metabolism, such as anticonvulsant
drugs, cytotoxic agents, estrogens, androgens, fluoride,
phosphate, or vitamin D. 19 age- and sex-matched healthy
subjects selected by identical criteria for normal renal,
hepatic, and gastrointestinal function were also studied to
provide comparative data. Informed consent was obtained
from all subjects before entry into the study. Patients were
divdied into two groups matched as nearly as possible for
age, sex, diagnosis, and dose and duration of steroid therapy.
Clinical and dietary data for the 9 25-OHD treatment and 8
control patients, as well as the 19 normal subjects are given
in Table I. The distribution of clinical diagnoses in the
25-OHD treatment group was rheumatoid arthritis, six
patients; systemic lupus erythematosis, two patients; and
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, one patient. The
control group was composed of six patients with rheumatoid
arthritis and two patients with systemic lupus erythematosis.
All studies were performed on the Clinical Research Center
of Barnes Hospital, Washington University School of
Medicine. Upon admission to study all patients underwent
an extensive interview to determine customary vitamin D
and calcium intake and hours of sunlight exposure as pre￾viously described (25). Physical functional status was deter￾mined by the Steinbrocker criteria (26).
Bone mass was determined by our previously described
photon absorption technique (6) in the radius of the lesser￾used arm at two locations: a metaphyseal site 2 cm proximal
to the distal end of the ulna and a diaphyseal site one-third
the distance from the distal to proximal end of the radius.
At least four scans were performed at each site. The proximal
site is composed primarily of cortical bone whereas the distal
site contains a relatively greater proportion of trabecular
bone (27). Values were calculated as grams per square centi￾meter and expressed as a percent of mean age-sex normal
values based on our previously established norms (6). The
accuracy of this technique is -4% and the precision 2-3% (8).
Blood samples were obtained at 8 a.m. after an overnight
fast. Serum calcium, inorganic phosphate, alkaline phos￾phatase, albumin, and creatinine concentrations, 24-h urinary
calcium and creatinine excretion, and creatinine clearance
were determined by Technicon AutoAnalyzer (Technicon
Instruments Corp., Tarrytown, N. Y.) (25,28). Serum iPTH
concentration was determined by the radioimmunoassay
technique of Slatopolsky et al. (29) and serum 25-OHD con￾centration by the competitive protein-binding assay of Haddad
and Chyu (30). At least two determinations of each of the
above parameters were obtained on all study patients before
initiation of the study and then once a month for the first
12 mo of study. Intestinal 47Ca absorption was determined
by the forearm counting technique of Wills et al. (31) em￾ploying a 100-mg 40Ca carrier dose given at 8 a.m. after an
overnight fast. 47Ca absorption was determined before initi￾ation of treatment and at 3-mo intervals thereafter.
Contralateral transiliac needle bone biopsies were per￾formed on 14 patients before and after 12 mo of treatment.
Eight patients (four treatment, four control) were administered
time-spaced tetracycline labels before each biopsy for mor￾phologic quantitation of the rate of bone mineralization (32).
The tetracycline was administered as 250 mg orally at 6-h
intervals for 2 d, with a 14-d interval between labels. The
clinical characteristics and responses to treatment of the
patients in each group who were subjected to bone biopsy were
representative of that group as a whole. After biopsy, each
specimen was fixed in neutral buffered formalin, embedded in
methyl methacrylate, and cut into nondecalcified sections
on a Jung model K sledge microtome (American Optical
Corp., Scientific Div., Buffalo, N. Y.). An entire section taken
from each biopsy, including both cortices and intervening
trabeculae, was stained by a modification of the Goldner
technique (33) and histologically quantitated using a Zeiss II
integrating eyepiece (Carl Zeiss, Inc., New York).
In the pretreatment biopsies, histometric parameters were
determined in trabecular bone and the results compared
to similar data obtained from 14 individuals of similar age
and sex selected from a series of sudden death autopsy
cases. Parameters measured were: (a) percent trabecular bone
volume, the percent of trabecular space occupied by bone
matrix; (b) percent relative osteoid volume, the percent of
trabecular bone matrix which is nonmineralized; (c) percent
total osteoid surface, the percent of trabecular surface covered
by nonmineralized bone matrix (osteoid); (d) percent
osteoblastic-osteoid surface, the percent of trabecular bone
covered by osteoid lined by characteristic cuboidal osteo￾blasts; and (e) number of osteoclasts per square millimeter
trabecular space.
Biopsies from the steroid-treated patients were then more
intensively analyzed for determination of the effects of 25-
OHD plus calcium supplement therapy. In addition to the
above, the following histometric parameters were quantitated
656 T. J. Hahn, L. R. Halstead, S. L. Teitelbaum, and B. H. Hahn

in these biopsies: (f) percent cortical bone volume, the
percent of cortical bone space occupied by bone matrix; (g)
osteoclasts per square millimeter cortical space; (h) osteo￾clasts per square millimeter cortical-endosteal surface; and
(i) osteoclasts per millimeter trabecular endosteal surface.
An unstained 10-,m section was then examined by fluores￾cent microscopy to measure the tetracycline-based parameters
in those patients who had been administered the tetracycline
labels. The following variables were quantitated as previously
described (34): (a) cellular rate of mineralization, the mean
distance (micrometers) between all double-fluorescent markers
within trabecular bone divided by the number of days
between administration of the labels (representing the rate
at which mineralization occurs at the average bone-forming
surface), and (b) linear extent of bone mineralization, the
absolute extent (micrometers) of bone forming surface (i.e.,
surface exhibiting a double tetracycline label) per square
millimeter trabecular space.
After the completion of base-line studies, patients in the
treatment group were begun on a regimen of25-OHD (40-100
,ug/d) plus calcium 500 mg (as calcium carbonate) daily,
whereas controls were placed on a minimal calcium supple￾ment (100 mg/d). The dose of 25-OHD was subsequently
adjusted at biweekly intervals to maintain urinary calcium
excretion below 300 mg/24 h.
The significance of differences between group means was
determined by Dunnett's multiple variable t test method
(35), correlation coefficients were calculated by Pearson's
formula, and reduced major regression axes were determined
by the method of Kermack and Haldane (36). All results are
reported as mean±standard error of the mean.
RESULTS
Basal biochemical parameters. Clinical charac￾teristics and dietary history data for the patient groups
and normal subjects are summarized in Table I. There
were no significant differences in age and sex dis￾tribution or dietary intake between patients and normal
subjects. Moreover, treatment and control patient
groups were quite similar with regard to mean daily
glucocorticoid dose, duration oftherapy, and functional
class.
Mean serum concentrations of total and ionized
calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, and 25-
OHD in the steroid-treated patients did not differ
significantly from those in normal subjects (Table II).
However, mean serum iPTH concentration in the
steroid-treated subjects was approximately twice the
mean normal value, and serum iPTH exhibited an
inverse correlation with serum ionized calcium con￾centration (r = -0.40, P < 0.05). 24-h urinary calcium
excretion expressed both as mg/g creatinine per 24 h
and mg/kg body wt per 24 h was not significantly dif￾ferent between the two groups. However, intestinal
47Ca absorption (percent of 100 mg dose) was signifi￾cantly reduced in steroid-treated subjects, averaging
59% of the normal value. No significant correlation
was observed between serum 25-OHD concentration
and percent 47Ca absorption (r = 0.07, P > 0.50).
However, there was a statistically significant inverse
correlation of serum iPTH concentration with intestinal
47Ca absorption (r = -0.52, P < 0.02).
As shown in Table III, bone mass measured by the
photon absorption method was reduced by 7.7%+3.2%
(P < 0.05) in the diaphyseal region of the radius and
by 33.0%+3.1% (P < 0.001) in the metaphyseal region
in glucocorticoid-treated patients relative to normal

on the pattern of bone loss in steroid-induced
osteopenia (6).
Response to 25-OHD and calcium administation. All
treatment patients were maintained on 500 mg/d
calcium given in divided doses at 8 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
throughout the study period. The first four patients
were initially started on 100 ,g/d 25-OHD, given orally
as a single dose at 8 a.m. However, rapid elevation of
urinary calcium to >300 mg/24 h in all four subjects by
2 wk of therapy (base line 117+9; 2-wk value 356±25
mg/24 h, P < 0.001) necessitated a rapid reduction in
dose to levels of40-60 ,g/d. By 4 wk after reduction in
dose, 24-h urine calcium had returned to acceptable
levels (248±19 mg/24 h; mean 25-OHD dose, 50 ,ugId).

line; 4-wk value 231+28 mg/24 h. P < 0.001 vs. baseline,

58.0 and 56.0 ,tgld, respectively. The 25-OHD dose was
subsequently adjusted in increments of 10 ,ug/d
biweekly to maintain 24-h urine calcium excretion
below 300 mg. The mean daily 25-OHD dose over the
first 12 mo of treatment was 42.3 ,ug (0.68 ug/kg body
wt per d).
Mean 24-h urinary calcium excretion in the 25-OHD￾treated patients remained significantly elevated over
base-line values and normal control levels throughout
the study period (Fig. 1). Concurrently, mean serum
total calcium concentration showed a slight but signifi￾cant increase (Fig. 1). However, hypercalcemia was

calcium concentration nor 24-h urinary calcium ex￾cretion changed significantly in control patients.
Intestinal 47Ca absorption in 25-OHD-treated
patients was increased by a mean of 45.5% (P < 0.001)
above base-line values at 3 mo, the earliest time point
examined (Fig. 2), and was maintained at similar levels
during the remainder of the initial 12 mo of treatment.
Mean percent intestinal 47Ca absorption in treated
patients at the end of 12 mo was 57.1+2.3%, slightly
but not significantly below that of the mean value for
normal subjects (63.7+4.6%, P > 0.10); mean percent
47Ca absorption in untreated patients remained signifi￾cantly reduced at 43.0+4.6% (P < 0.001 compared to
normals).
Concurrent with the increase in intestinal 47Ca ab￾sorption, serum iPTH concentration fell significantly
after 25-OHD treatment, reaching a mean value not
significantly different from normal by 3 mo and remain￾ing essentially unchanged during the remainder of the
study (Fig. 2). Values for serum iPTH concentration
during the period of 25-OHD treatment showed a
strong inverse correlation with 47Ca absorption (r
= -0.71, P < 0.001). In control subjects the serum
iPTH concentration remained elevated.
As shown in Fig. 3, serum 25-OHD concentration

12-mo values in control patients were not statistically
different from 25-OHD-treated patients: glucocorticoid
dose, 14+0.9 mg prednisone equivalent/d, functional
class 2.0±0.2 ranking units. Therefore it is unlikely that
the observed increase in bone mass in the 25-OHD￾treated subjects was due to either decreased steroid
dose or increased physical activity.
The results of more prolonged follow-up of25-OHD￾treated and control subjects are presented in Table IV.
After a mean period of 18 mo on treatment, the 25-
OHD-treated patients maintained the improved in￾testinal 47Ca absorption, serum iPTH, and bone mass
status observed after 12 mo of treatment. There were no
statistically significant differences between 12- and 18-
mo values for either the treated or control groups.

trol biopsies, the osteoid seams tended to be thinner
than normal. Additionally, there were abundant skeletal
cells in the bones of the glucocorticoid-treated pa￾tients. The percent osteoblastic-osteoid surface was in￾creased and the number ofosteoclasts within trabecular
bone averaged three times normal, although this latter
difference was not statistically significant.
The only significant histologic difference between
the control and 25-OHD treatment patient groups ob￾served on the initial biopsies related to osteoclasts
on the cortical-endosteal surface (Table VI). The num￾ber of these cells was significantly less (P < 0.05) in
the control group than in the 25-OHD treatment group.
On the other hand, after therapy the number of osteo￾clasts per square millimeter of cortical endosteal bone
surface was greater in the control than in the 25-OHD￾treated patients (P < 0.05). Furthermore, posttreatment
biopsies in the 25-OHD group contained fewer
osteoclasts per square millimeter of cortical bone than
did those of control patients (P < 0.05). No other sig￾nificant differences existed between the posttreatment
biopsies of 25-OHD-treated and control subjects.
As compared to published normal values (37), the
cellular rate of mineralization was suppressed in four
pretreatment biopsies of patients in the 25-OHD treat￾ment group and in one of four control subjects in whom
this parameter was examined (Table VII). Indeed, three
of the four initial biopsies of the 25-OHD group and
one initial biopsy of the control group contained no
double-fluorescent tetracycline labels. Three of the
four second biopsies in the 25-OHD-treated group ex￾hibited normal cellular mineralization rates. On the
subjects at the indicated times.
other hand, the second biopsy taken from the control
patient whose initial biopsy contained no fluorescent
labels again exhibited no evidence of bone mineraliza￾tion. However, these differences between groups were
not statistically significant. There were also no sig￾nificant changes in either group in the linear extent
of bone mineralization, which reflects the extent of
bone surface involved in active bone formation. How￾ever, although the mean linear extent of bone mineral￾ization decreased in the control patients, after 12 mo
there was an increase in the mean linear extent of bone
mineralization in 25-OHD-treated patients.

absorption, increased serum iPTH concentrations,

decreased metaphyseal bone mass, and bone histo￾morphometric evidence of decreased bone formation
and a tendency toward increased numbers of osteoclasts
were demonstrated in a group of patients receiving
chronic moderate-dose glucocorticoid therapy. These
findings are generally in accord with those previously
reported in patients with glucocorticoid-induced os￾teopenia (7, 8, 13-19).
Despite evidence of markedly reduced calcium
absorption, the mean serum total and ionized calcium
concentration in the patient group was not significantly
different from normal values, presumably reflecting the
effects of secondarily increased PTH secretion with
maintenance of serum calcium concentration partially
at the expense of mobilization of calcium from bone
(38). In addition, the slight decrease in mean urinary
calcium excretion in our patients, relative to normal
subjects, may in part reflect the renal tubular cal￾cium-retaining effects of increased circulating PTH
concentrations (39).
Pretreatment serum 25-OHD levels in our patients
were normal and showed no significant correlation with
intestinal 47Ca absorption. These data are in concert
with previous reports from this laboratory as well as
others (23,24). However, they are somewhat in contrast
to the observations of Klein et al. (19) who reported
significantly decreased serum 25-OHD concentration
correlating with decreased intestinal calcium absorp￾tion in subjects treated chronically with higher doses of
glucocorticoids (equivalent to 40 mg prednisone/d).
The explanation for this difference is not readily
apparent, although it could be postulated that at the
higher doses employed in the patients studied by Klein
et al. secondary alterations in 25-OHD metabolism,
such as steroid-induced increases in hepatic mixed
oxidase catabolism of vitamin D metabolites (40,41) or
accelerated conversion of 25-OHD to dihydroxy
metabolites secondary to increased PTH activity (42),
could result in lowering of serum 25-OHD levels.
Whatever the case, our present findings demonstrate
that marked reductions in intestinal calcium absorption
can occur in the presence of normal concentrations of
circulating 25-OHD in patients treated with moderate
doses of glucocorticoids.
In response to supplementation with 25-OHD at a
mean dose of 40 ,ug/d, intestinal calcium absorption
rose to approximately normal levels and serum iPTH
was reduced. Stimulation of calcium absorption may
have been the result of both the effects of an increased
circulating 25-OHD concentration and the marked
increase in local 25-OHD concentration at the
intestinal mucosal cell as a result of oral 25-OHD
administration. At the point at which 47Ca absorption
was normalized, serum 25-OHD concentrations were in
the range of 100 ng/ml, approximately five times normal
levels. This disparity suggests a relative resistance to
the calcium absorption-stimulating effects of 25-OHD.
It could be proposed that this apparent resistance was
the result of glucocorticoid-induced alterations in the
conversion of 25-OHD to 1,25-(OH)2D, the apparent
final and most biologically potent vitamin D metabolite
(43). This viewpoint is supported by the observations of
(a) Carre et al. (21) who have suggested that
glucocorticoids may accelerate the metabolism of 1,25-
(OH)2D3 to an inactive product, and (b) Klein et al. (19)
who have reported that 1,25-(OH)2D3 in near-physio￾logic doses can restore intestinal calcium absorption to
approximately normal levels in glucocorticoid-treated
individuals. On the other hand, it has been reported
that conversion of vitamin D3 to 1,25-(OH)2D3 and
localization of 1,25-(OH)2D3 in intestinal mucosal cell
nuclei proceeds normally in cortisone-treated rats (22).
However, because serum 1,25-(OH)2D levels were not
measured in our patients, our present data do not allow
us to choose between hypotheses regarding the
mechanism of resistance to 25-OHD.
At the bone level, treatment with 25-OHD and
calcium was accompanied by a significant decrease in
osteoclast number. This decrease can apparently be
attributed to suppression of PTH secretion, since it
has been demonstrated that the osteoclastic response
to glucocorticoids is mediated through increased PTH
activity, whereas the suppression of bone formation
is apparently the result of a direct effect on osteoblast
function (10). It is of interest that double fluorescent
labels were present in the post-25-OHD treatment
biopsies of three individuals whose initial biopsies
showed no evidence of bone formation. However, the
number of patients receiving time-spaced tetracycline
labels is too few to draw definite conclusions re￾garding effects on bone accretion rates. Thus, the
histomorphometric changes suggest that the net in￾crease in bone mass demonstrated by photon absorp￾tion densitometry resulted at least in part from de￾creased osteoclastic resorptive activity, with the pos￾sibility existing that the bone formation rate may have
been increased concurrently. Since bone mass meas￾ured by photon absorption was not increasing de￾tectably at 12 mo in the 25-OHD-treated group, the
bone histomorphometric parameters at that point may
reflect a new steady state of formation and resorption
under the influence of 25-OHD administration.
It is not surprising that the most marked increment
in bone mass was observed at the metaphyseal site,
since this region contains a larger proportion of more
metabolically active bone and exhibits the greatest
degree of change in states of increased parathyroid
activity (6, 9, 27).
Although our results indicate that restoration of
intestinal calcium absorption and serum iPTH values
to normal levels with 25-OHD and calcium supple￾mentation is accompanied by improvement in several
parameters of mineral metabolism in glucocorticoid￾treated patients, several questions remain to be
Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteopenia: Effect of 25-Hydroxyvitamin D 663

answered. First, the normalization of serum iPTH
concentration produced by increasing intestinal cal￾cium absorption was accompanied by an increase in
urinary calcium excretion to levels significantly above
base line. This increase was apparently the result of a
stimulation of intestinal calcium absorption to a level
greater than that which could be readily assimilated
by bone. Although prolonged hypercalciuria can ul￾timately lead to renal calculus formation and a de￾terioration of renal function (44), in our patients urinary
calcium levels were generally only slightly above
normal and creatinine clearance was not altered over
the 18-mo study. It is possible that a more precise ad￾justment of 25-OHD and calcium dose could produce
a normalization of PTH activity with only minimal
changes in urinary calcium excretion.
Secondly, since bone formation and resorption rates
frequently change in parallel fashion (45), a reduction
in bone resorption rate might ultimately be accom￾panied by a concomitant decline in bone formation. If
this were to occur, a later decrease in bone mass might
follow with formation and resorption restored to their
previous equilibrium, albeit at a lower level of bone
turnover. However, no evidence ot a secondary de￾crement in bone mass was observed in our patients.
Finally, since the resistance of bone to stress frac￾ture correlates positively with bone mass as determined
by photon absorption densitometry (46), the observed
increase in bone mass might ultimately lead to a re￾duced propensity to bone fractures in glucocorticoid￾treated patients receiving 25-OHD chronically. How￾ever, the clinical efficacy of this mode of treatment
remains to be determined.
