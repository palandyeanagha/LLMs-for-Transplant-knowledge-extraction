ABSTRACT
The final therapy of ‘end-stage heart failure’ is
orthotopic heart, lung or heart-lung transplantation.
However, these options are not available for many
patients worldwide. Therefore, novel therapeutical
strategies are needed. Based on pathophysiological
insights regarding (1) the long-term impact of an
obstructive pulmonary outflow tract in neonates with
congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries,
(2) the importance of a restrictive versus a non-restrictive
atrial septum in neonates born with a borderline left
ventricle and (3) the significance of both, a patent
foramen ovale and/or open ductus arteriosus for survival
of newborns with persistent pulmonary hypertension, the
current review introduces some therapeutical strategies
that may be applicable to selected patients with heart
failure. These strategies include (1) reversible pulmonary
artery banding in left ventricular-dilated cardiomyopathy
with preserved right ventricular function, (2) the creation
of restrictive interatrial communication to treat diastolic
(systolic) heart failure, (3) atrioseptostomy or reverse
Potts shunt in pulmonary arterial hypertension and (4)
return to a fetal, parallel circulation by combining
atrioseptostomy and reversed Potts shunt with or
without placement of a bilateral pulmonary artery
banding. While still being experimental, it is hoped that
the procedures presented in the current overview will
inspire future novel therapeutic strategies that may be
applicable to selected patients with heart failure.
INTRODUCTION
End-stage heart failure is the cause of death or
need for heart transplantation (HTx) in many car￾diovascular conditions.1 Heart failure represents a
progressive disease with a wide symptom spectrum.
Despite existing myocardial damage, initially,
endogenous pathophysiological mechanisms will
prevent cardiac decompensation and failing of the
systemic, morphologically left, right or even single
ventricle at rest. Additionally, it is commonly
observed that heart failure remains mostly compen￾sated as long as right ventricular (RV) function is
preserved. Unfortunately, due to ventriculo￾ventricular interaction, systemic ventricular dys￾function will generally have a detrimental impact
on the function of the subpulmonary ventricle
during long term. Guazzi and Borlaug2 emphasise
the importance of the lung downstream pressure
(left atrial pressure, LAP) as an important contribu￾tor to pulmonary artery pressure (PAP). The rela￾tionship between mean PAP and LAP is best
reflected by the calculated transpulmonary gradient
(TPG=mean PAP−LAP) and in particular the dia￾stolic PAP to LAP difference, the so-called diastolic
pressure gradient (DPG=diastolic PAP−LAP). Both
parameters become even more important in the
setting of heart failure: pulmonary hypertension
(PH) associated with an increased LAP, but normal
TPG (<12 mm Hg) and in particular DPG
(<7 mm Hg)—labelled isolated postcapillary pul￾monary hypertension—may increase RV afterload
and negatively affect right (subpulmonary) ven￾tricular function. During the course of the disease
however there may be transition from purely
passive pressure elevation to reactive pulmonary
vascular disease. The transition from isolated to
combined postcapillary pulmonary hypertension is
highly variable from patient to patient.
Non-reactive or fixed pulmonary arterial hyperten￾sion (PAH) is the result of a continuous vascular
remodelling, while reactive PH is characterised by a
remodelled vasculature that can still dilate.3
Chronically increased afterload forces the subpul￾monary ventricle to adapt with appropriate hyper￾trophy but ultimately the RV compensatory
mechanisms are exhausted leading to RV failure. As
usually RV and left ventricle (LV) are serially con￾nected, advanced right heart failure may lead to a
paradoxical underfilling of the LV.4 Considering
that the right and left hearts do not act in isolation
and that LV may be responsible for more than 50%
of RV function under healthy conditions,5 the
changes in right heart pressure and volume affect
the left side of the heart and vice versa. This
cardiac coupling, referred as ‘diastolic’ ventricular
interaction,6 is illustrated in the online
supplementary video 1a–c.
In summary, left heart-dependent PH might be
misinterpreted by focusing exclusively on TPG; the
calculated value might be misinterpreted in consid￾eration of the reversibility of PH or in the setting
of decision-making for heart or heart-lung trans￾plantation. Therefore, as already emphasised by
several other authors,7 DPG should be entered into
the analysis of PH, because DPG might be low, in
spite of a calculated TPG above 15 mm Hg.
Generally, the mean and, in particular, the systolic
pulmonary pressures are cardiac output
(CO)-dependent variables, but the diastolic pul￾monary pressure remains quite independent from
CO changes.7 In addition, considering the margin
of error of CO measurements, in particular in con￾genital heart disease with non-static left-to-right,

bidirectional or even right-to-left shunts, we emphasise to use
the relationship of the diastolic pressure—pulmonary arterial
pressure and systemic arterial pressure (PAPd/SAPd)—ratio as
very practical to compare the ‘true’ vascular resistance of both,
the pulmonary and systemic circulation. In addition, the preca￾pillary component of the pulmonary vascular circulation can
additionally be assumed by analysing DPG.
In LV-dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), stroke volume remains
preserved by LV dilatation on the expense of a high-end systolic
volume; the physiopathology of a borderline left ventricle (BLV)
and even restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) is characterised by
CpcPH; the precapillary pulmonary component prevents pul￾monary oedema. The properly adapted RV is able over quite
some time to maintain filling and pumping. Thus, systemic, or
sometimes suprasystemic, pulmonary artery pressures can
develop, which correspond to a pulmonary artery banding
(PAB) effect that preserves RV systolic function, in particular in
the setting of a congenitally restrictive LV-cardiomyopathy (see
online supplementary video 1b). However, the disease process is
progressive and finally irreversible, resulting in LV, RV or biven￾tricular (BV) failure with subsequent multi-organ failure.
Here we describe established and hypothetical novel percu￾taneous interventional, surgical open chest and hybrid techni￾ques that may palliate ‘end-stage’ heart failure, with the
potential to improve clinical symptoms and for bridging to
transplantation; there can be also a chance for recovery, in par￾ticular in infants and young children.
Figure 1 summarises our current surgical interventional strat￾egies, which were developed on an individual case-by-case basis,
paying attention to natural phenomena like fetal and postnatal
transitional circulation and atrioventricular and ventriculo￾ventricular interactions.
In our opinion, prior to HTx and Heart-Lung-Transplantation
(HLTx) or placement of an LV assist device or biventricular
assist device, a repertoire of novel therapeutic surgical interven￾tional options is available that might reduce the need for such
procedures.
Reversible pulmonary artery banding (rPAB)
LV-DCM is characterised by reduced LV ejection fraction (EF),
but preserved RV-EF. Idiopathic LV-DCM is the predominant
form in infants and young children, while ischaemic DCM pre￾dominates in adults. DCM is a myocardial disease with systolic
cardiac dysfunction and dilatation.8
Considering patients with a systemic RV, the long-term
outcome is directly related to a balanced ventricular interaction
and the competence of the systemic atrioventricular valve.9
Dilatation of the systemic ventricle is prevented by subpulmon￾ary (left) ventricular outflow tract obstructions or even signifi￾cant PH. Surgical rPAB may be used, if such an obstruction is
absent.10 In congenitally corrected transposition of the great
arteries (CCTGA), rPAB has been used for retraining of subpul￾monary LV-DCM,10 and as a preventative strategy in new￾borns.11 Considering favourable results of PAB in children with
CCTGA, in Giessen12 we also applied surgical rPAB to treat
LV-DCM with preserved RV-EF (figure 2 and online
supplementary video 2a,b). The entry criteria for using rPAB in
the setting of LV-DCM have been recently published.12 The pro￾posed mechanisms of rPAB action are summarised in box 1: it is
postulated that the efficacy of rPAB correlates negatively with
the patient’s age. The potential for myocardiocyte recovery and
myocardiocyte repopulation may be greatest in infancy.13
Hypothetically, even in adults an adjustable PAB might be able
to induce in certain patients a less rapid, but nevertheless signifi￾cant improvement of LV systolic impairment, but this remains
unproven at present. Sufficient RV adaption to PAB seems to be
age-dependent not at least by the chance of young children to
grow in PAB, which may prevent the need for rebanding.12
Animal models demonstrated that chronic PAB increases the
myocytal size during RV-hypertrophy and induces a cell growth￾directed gene expression pattern, accompanied by a maintained
capillary network.14 Additionally, the adaptive response of the
cardiac pressure overload is associated with an IGF release and
fibroblast expression of the transcription factor KLF-5.15 In
infants and young children with LV-DCM, rPAB improved
LV-EF and decreased highly significantly left ventricular end-dia￾stolic diameter (LVEDD) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)
blood levels.12 The surgical technique of PAB also allows percu￾taneous catheter-based gradual debanding.12
The current results, partially published,16 can be seen as
‘proof-of-principle’ data obtained in currently 35 infants and
young children: 31 procedures were successful, while 4 children

did not show any response. Thus, rPAB in LV failure may
provide a novel alternative for ‘bridge-to-transplant’ or destin￾ation therapy in children with advanced LV-DCM; in addition,
nowadays there are also some successful case experiences with
PAB in LV-DCM in several other centres worldwide.
Considering the fact, that randomised studies in Europe and the
USA are planned for rPAB in infants with DCM, we want to
point out that the surgical rPAB needs to be paired with an
improved anticongestive therapy.17 The endogenous neurohu￾moral activation, which occurs in all forms of heart failure,
should be inhibited, especially in severe forms of LV-DCM; the
myocardiocytes and cardiac interstitium need to be protected
against the additional mechanical stress of PAB. Taking the neu￾rohumoral activation in patients with severe DCM and consider￾ing the differences of the β-adrenergic receptor pathophysiology
between paediatric and adult patients with DCM, in our institu￾tion17 all infants and children undergoing rPAB are being
treated with a β1-specific β-blocker (bisoprolol), a tissue ACE
inhibitor (lisinopril) and a mineralocorticoid blocker (spirono￾lactone), while we avoid other diuretics to the extent that is pos￾sible. Clearly, long-term risks and benefits need to be analysed
in a multicentre study. Additionally, it should prove if this
approach can be expanded to older children suffering LV-DCM.
In summary, it is hypothesised that rPAB leads to LV recovery
and diminishes the need for mechanical circulatory assist devices
or HTx in selected patients and should be considered.
Creation of an interatrial communication for diastolic
(systolic) heart failure
Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is attributed to
diastolic dysfunction, which ranges from discrete failure of myo￾cardial relaxation to significant anatomical limitations of the size
of the systemic ventricle.18 The prominent characteristic of dia￾stolic incompetence of the systemic ventricle is a dilated left
atrium independent of a pre-existing atrioventricular concord￾ance or discordance. Advanced ageing hearts acquire commonly
a diastolic dysfunction with preserved LV-EF.19 LV RCM leads
to an impaired ventricular filling, which underlines the import￾ance of the systolic to diastolic duration ratio.20 Patients with LV

cardiomyopathy (DCM). Depicted are the MRI of left-sided DCM in four chambers and sagittal views before and in the follow-up after a surgically
performed PAB (picture in the middle); the progression of left-ventricular dilatation with its pathological ventriculo-ventricular interaction caused by
the morphological change of the left ventricle from ellipsoid to a spherical left ventricle (LV)-form (like pear to apple) lead to a consecutively
compressed right ventricular to a banana-shaped chamber associated with an early compromised diastolic inflow. The rationale to place a surgically
rPAB is to induce a leftward mechanical shift of the interventricular septum back to the LV with a normally shaped left ventricle potentially resulting
in an improved LV function.
Box 1 Mechanisms of reversible PAB in LV-DCM
1. Increase of RV contractility (Anrep effect), wall stress and
isovolemic contraction
2. Stimulation of RV hypertrophy and matrix remodelling
3. Improvement of RV diastolic inflow characteristics
4. Leftward shift of the IVS and restoration of electromechanical
RV-LV synchrony
5. Reduction of LVED volume with reshaping from spherical to
ellipsoid morphology
6. Reduction of LV-filling dynamics (preload) and subsequent
LVED pressure
7. Improvement of LA–LV interaction by reduction of left atrial
volume overload
8. Restoration and improvement of MV regurgitation and LV
ejection fraction
9. LV reverse remodelling (co-hypertrophy) by favouring
endogenous repair potentials

RCM, but morphologically not affected RV, remain clinically
stable at rest despite excessive PH values.21 Thus risk stratifica￾tion and the decision to list a patient for HTx become problem￾atic and need to be assessed on an individual basis.22 Medical
therapy options are limited (mostly to diuretics) and do not
improve outcome. Of the presently used treatment options so
far, only the mineralocorticoid receptor blocker, spironolactone,
showed a moderate, but significant improvement of heart failure
with preserved EF.23 On the contrary, several transcatheter or
surgical interventional hybrid strategies might be an additional
option in severe diseased diastolic dysfunctional left hearts,
independent if these are caused by LV-RCM, BLV or congenital
left-heart defects like a Shone complex. Based on our experi￾ences with neonates born with a hypoplastic left-heart
complex,24 the use of fenestration in the Fontan circulation and
the effects of a restrictive left-to-right shunt in patients with
RCM and DCM, we hypothesise that a defined interatrial com￾munication might improve congestive symptoms and reduce the
incidence of atrial tachyarrhythmia (eg, atrial fibrillation) in
these settings. Such a restricted atrial septum defect with an age￾dependent width between 4 and 10 mm can be created by a
transcatheter atrioseptostomy followed by passive gradual bal￾looning or by placement of a slightly diabolo-shaped stent
(figure 3). In future, several ‘diastolic devices’ with a predefined
hole will become available. These should prevent re-occlusion
and allow left-heart interventions, if necessary. These measures
of a restrictive, left-to-right shunt are able to reduce the degree
of left atrial hypertension. Left atrial decompression improves
the atrioventricular interaction and global haemodynamic func￾tion; by reducing left atrium pressure and enlargement may be
the incidence of atrial fibrillation is influenced, too. In addition,
secondary PH should be reduced by direct impact on the pul￾monary congestion.
Considering our currently only partially published institu￾tional experience of percutaneous left atrial decompression,25
creating a restrictive atrial septum defect (rASD) is safe and
technically feasible at any age. Restriction of the interatrial com￾munication preserves an adequate filling pressure for diastolic
and/or systolic dysfunctional systemic ventricles, but clinical
symptoms related to the ‘out-of-proportion’ left atrial and pul￾monary pressures can significantly be influenced.
Back to a ‘fetal’ parallel circulation: atrioseptostomy,
reversed Potts shunt or both
A reverse Potts shunt has been described as an alternative for
lung transplantation in selected children with suprasystemic
idiopathic PAH.26 The anastomosis between the left pulmonary
artery and descending aorta allows a right-to-left shunt and
thereby decompression of a failing RV combined with an
improvement of the systemic circulation on expense of oxygen
desaturation of the lower body part if pulmonary arterial pres￾sures are suprasystemic. However, in contrast to a right-left
shunting intracardiac defect, oxygen desaturation of the upper
part of the body is avoided. Recently, transcatheter techniques
have been reported for re-establishing a right-to-left shunting
duct in patients with suprasystemic PH of various etiologies,27

transplantation (HTx); the 2-D echocardiography shows massive left atrial enlargement associated with a ‘out-of-proportional’ left atrial pressure
related pulmonary hypertension at a suprasystemic level (systolic pressure gradient of 97 mm Hg, upper panel). The creation of a restrictive atrial
septum defect, by placing a stent within the perforated atrial septum, led to a decreased left atrial dimension/pressure as well as reduced pulmonary
artery pressures (lower panel). Placement of an assist device could be avoided, a successful HTx performed.

and even for the creation a de novo communication between
the left pulmonary artery and descending aorta.28
Based on the experience with ‘Hybrid approach’ in neonates
with a morphologically hypoplastic left heart,29 we believe that
a comparable strategy, back to a parallel ‘fetal-like’ circulation,
might offer an option for selected patients with ‘end-stage’
left-heart failure associated with CpcPH.30 31 The creation of a
rASD decompresses an ‘out-of-proportion’ LAP and leads—
depending on the atrial pressure differences—to a left-to-right
shunt. In combination with a right-to-left shunting pulmonary￾to-systemic communication, BV function may improve by
unloading and economising both sides of the heart. As suprasys￾temic pulmonary and RV pressure decreases to a systemic level,
the heart becomes unloaded by a decreased LV preload and a
resynchronised ventricular interaction. This may be accompan￾ied by improved systemic oxygen delivery potentially leading to
improved New York Heart Association functional class. Such a
duct-like Eisenmenger’s physiopathology does not preserve
highly oxygenated coronary and cerebral blood flow but the
combination with a left-to-right shunting rASD could avoid
extreme oxygen desaturation of the lower body part, too. The
availability of a valved Potts shunt conduit would allow an
earlier intervention via transcatheter or surgical techniques in
patients with an idiopathic or left heart-dependent PAH. The
intervention could be performed even in terms of a diastolic
PAP:SAP ratio of <1. Furthermore, in case of improvement of
pulmonary pressures after Potts shunt creation, a diastolic left￾right shunt would be avoided. In particular in selected young
patients, achievement of a parallel circulation requires the com￾bination of an interatrial, left-right shunt with a reverse Potts
shunt, and the addition of bilateral PAB31; however, in spite of
such bandings, a diastolic left-to-right shunt might occur in par￾ticular when the haemodynamics improve (figure 4). This high￾lights some of the potential dangers associated with re-ducting
or creating a reversed Potts shunt, emphasising the need for
careful assessment in particular if cardiac failure is associated
with CpcPH.
Although speculative at present, ‘Hybrid strategies’ might
have a survival benefit even in adolescents with a severe diastolic
left-heart failure. Timing of such a comprehensive approach in
the setting of a dysfunctional global circulation might, however,
be difficult. We argue that a disproportionate postcapillary PH
and ensuing RV failure necessitating listing for heart-lung trans￾plantation might be one criterion, favouring a hybrid approach
that includes percutaneous atrioseptostomy with or without
device implantation and a surgically created or transcatheter￾created reversed Potts shunt, in some together with bilateral pul￾monary banding, although this approach has to be still regarded
as experimental at present.
In conclusion, this article provides insight into some novel
methods for managing selected patients with heart failure. These
procedures have still to be regarded as experimental and should
only be regarded as a potential adjunct to management in accord￾ance to the current heart failure guidelines.32 The procedures are
inspired by our work with children with congenital heart disease
and the pathophysiological insights gained in this setting. It is
hoped that the provided figures and online supplementary video
represent informative examples for the concepts discussed. Some
congenital conditions may serve as a model disease that may
eventually lead to novel therapy options for heart failure.
Especially in adults with acquired heart failure, these treatments
currently remain largely untested and require further studies.
