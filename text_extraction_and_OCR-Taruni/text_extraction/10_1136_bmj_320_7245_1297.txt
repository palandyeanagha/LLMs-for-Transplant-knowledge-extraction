Abstract
Objectives To determine the effect of long term
inhaled corticosteroids on lung function,
exacerbations, and health status in patients with
moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease.
Design Double blind, placebo controlled study.
Setting Eighteen UK hospitals.
Participants 751 men and women aged between 40
and 75 years with mean forced expiratory volume in
one second (FEV1) 50% of predicted normal.
Interventions Inhaled fluticasone propionate 500 ìg
twice daily from a metered dose inhaler or identical
placebo.
Main outcome measures Efficacy measures: rate of
decline in FEV1 after the bronchodilator and in health
status, frequency of exacerbations, respiratory
withdrawals. Safety measures: morning serum cortisol
concentration, incidence of adverse events.
Results There was no significant difference in the
annual rate of decline in FEV1 (P = 0.16). Mean FEV1
after bronchodilator remained significantly higher
throughout the study with fluticasone propionate
compared with placebo (P < 0.001). Median
exacerbation rate was reduced by 25% from 1.32 a
year on placebo to 0.99 a year on with fluticasone
propionate (P = 0.026). Health status deteriorated by
3.2 units a year on placebo and 2.0 units a year on
fluticasone propionate (P = 0.0043). Withdrawals
because of respiratory disease not related to
malignancy were higher in the placebo group (25% v
19%, P = 0.034).
Conclusions Fluticasone propionate 500 ìg twice
daily did not affect the rate of decline in FEV1 but did
produce a small increase in FEV1. Patients on
fluticasone propionate had fewer exacerbations and a
slower decline in health status. These improvements
in clinical outcomes support the use of this treatment
in patients with moderate to severe chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease.
Introduction
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a leading
cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide,1 2 and its
prevalence is rising.3 It occurs predominantly in
tobacco smokers and is characterised by an increase in
the annual rate of decline of forced expiratory volume
in one second (FEV1).4 As lung function deteriorates,
substantial changes in general health occur.5 Smoking
cessation reduces the rate of decline in FEV1 in people
with this disease,6 but no pharmacological intervention
has been shown to modify the progression of disease
or the associated decline in health status.
In at least 10% of patients with stable chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease FEV1 will increase
significantly after oral prednisolone.7 A large, retro￾spective, open study reported a reduction in the rate of
decline of FEV1 in those taking oral corticosteroids.8
Recently, two studies over three years of inhaled
budesonide 800 ìg in mild to moderate chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease found no effect of treat￾ment on the rate of decline in FEV1.
9 10 Clinical
outcomes such as exacerbations, however, were
infrequent and health status either showed no benefit
of budesonide9 or was not assessed.10
The inhaled steroids in obstructive lung disease in
Europe (ISOLDE) study was designed to test the effect
of inhaled fluticasone propionate 500 ìg twice daily on
the rate of decline of FEV1 and other relevant clinical
outcomes.
Participants and methods
Participants
Eighteen UK hospitals participated. Patients were cur￾rent or former smokers aged 40-75 years with
non-asthmatic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Baseline FEV1 after bronchodilator was at least 0.8
litres but less than 85% of predicted normal, and the
ratio of FEV1 to forced vital capacity was less than 70%.
Previous use of inhaled and oral corticosteroids was
permitted. Patients were excluded if their FEV1
response to 400 ìg salbutamol exceeded 10% of
predicted normal, they had a life expectancy of less
than five years from concurrent diseases, or they used â
blockers. Nasal and ophthalmic corticosteroids, theo￾phyllines, and all other bronchodilators were allowed
during the study.

The protocol was approved by each centre’s local
ethical committee and patients provided written
informed consent.
Trial design
Patients were recruited between 1 October 1992 and
31 March 1995. Eligible patients entered an eight week
run-in period after withdrawal from any oral or
inhaled corticosteroids. After clinic visits at 0, 4, and 8
weeks (visits 0, 1, and 2, respectively) patients were ran￾domised to receive either fluticasone propionate 500
ìg or an identical placebo twice daily administered
from a metered dose inhaler and with a spacer device
by using 10 tidal breaths after each of two actuations.
We used a computer generated allocation schedule
stratified by centre (block size of six). Patients were ran￾domised sequentially from a list comprising treatment
numbers only. Throughout the trial patients used
salbutamol (100 ìg/puff) or ipratropium bromide
(40 ìg/puff), or both, for symptomatic relief.
Before the double blind phase, and if not contrain￾dicated, patients received oral prednisolone 0.6
mg/kg/day for 14 days, after which spirometry was
performed. These data were used to test whether the
acute corticosteroid response could predict those
patients who would benefit from long term inhaled
corticosteroids. During the three year double blind
phase, participants visited a clinic every three months
for spirometry, recording of exacerbations, and safety
assessments.
The primary end point was the decline (ml/year) in
FEV1 after bronchodilator. About 450 patients with two
or more measurements of FEV1 during treatment were
required to detect a treatment difference of 20 ml/year,
assuming a linear decline and a SD of 75 ml/year, with
80% power. Other key end points were frequency of
exacerbation, changes in health status, withdrawals
because of respiratory disease, morning serum cortisol
concentrations, and adverse events.
Measurements
Spirometry measurements were recorded by well
trained staff using a standardised procedure on new
Sensormedics 2130D spirometers. Quality control
included a computer generated check against the ATS
criteria11 and a central manual check for acceptability
and reproducibility for all measurements, resulting in
standards comparable with the lung health study.12
Visits were rescheduled to four weeks after any respira￾tory infections or exacerbations of the disease.
An exacerbation was defined as worsening of respi￾ratory symptoms that required treatment with oral

corticosteroids or antibiotics, or both, as judged by the
general practitioner; specific symptom criteria were
not used. Patients were withdrawn from the study if the
number of exacerbations that required corticosteroids
exceeded two in any three month period.
Health status was assessed at baseline and six
monthly thereafter by using the disease specific St
George’s respiratory questionnaire (SGRQ).13 This
questionnaire is sensitive to changes in treatment.14 A
change in total score of four or more units represents a
clinically important change in the patient’s condition.5
Serum cortisol concentrations were measured before
randomisation (baseline) and every six months during
treatment. Samples were taken between 8 am and 10
am and were analysed with the ELISA-Boehringer
Mannheim ES700 method.
At each visit patients were questioned about smok￾ing status. Non-smoking was checked with exhaled car￾bon monoxide and urinary cotinine measurements.
Self declared non-smokers were classified as smokers if
cotinine was > 40 ng/ml or carbon monoxide was
> 10 ppm at two visits. For analysis patients were
categorised as continuous smokers, continuous former
smokers, or intermittent smokers during the study.
Statistical analysis
Analyses for each parameter included all randomised
patients with at least one valid measurement. To use all
patient data we adopted the mixed models approach15
for the primary analysis of FEV1 and total score. This
is the most suitable technique for estimating rates of
change, with allowance for the correlation structure of
repeated measures data. Regression estimates were
adjusted for patient differences in the number of
observations contributing to the model and for
variances within patients.16 Fixed effects were time and
five covariates: baseline value centre, age, sex, and
smoking status. Baseline FEV1 was the mean at four
and eight weeks of the run-in period—that is, at least
four weeks after withdrawal of corticosteroids. Subject
effects were assumed to be random. The treatment by
time interaction tested for a differential treatment
effect on the rate of change in FEV1 or respiratory
questionnaire score. The model for FEV1 also
included a treatment main effect to help to account for
the early non-linear treatment changes. Measure￾ments at the end of the prednisolone trial were
excluded from the model of decline in FEV1. FEV1 was
also compared by using analysis of covariance after 3,
6, 12, 24, and 36 months to investigate treatment
differences over time.
Patient exacerbation rates were calculated as the
exacerbation number per treatment days and
extrapolated-interpolated to a number per treatment
year. The Wilcoxon rank sum test,17 stratified by centre-
,tested for treatment differences.
Fisher’s exact test compared treatment withdrawals
due to respiratory causes. These included any
non-malignant lower respiratory diseases. Analysis of
covariance compared data on log transformed serum
cortisol concentration during treatment, adjusted for
baseline. Tests were two sided, with a 5% significance
level.
Results
Patient demographics
Of the 751 patients randomised, 376 received
fluticasone propionate and 375 placebo (figure 1). Dur￾ing the double blind phase, 160 patients (43%)
withdrew from the fluticasone propionate group and
195 patients (53%) from the placebo group, the
commonest reason being frequent exacerbations of
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Mean FEV1 at
visit two was 160 ml lower in patients who withdrew
from placebo compared with those who did not
withdraw (1.30 litre v 1.46 litre); patients who withdrew
from fluticasone propionate had a 40 ml higher FEV1
compared with those who did not withdraw (1.44 litre
v 1.40 litre). Treatment groups were well matched at
baseline (table 1).
Changes in FEV1
There was a fall in mean FEV1 after bronchodilator
during the the run-in (placebo 75 ml, fluticasone
propionate 65 ml) (fig 2). The effect was greater in
patients who withdrew from inhaled corticosteroids at
run-in (89 ml compared with 47 ml in the steroid naive
group). After oral prednisolone there was a 60 ml (SD
170 ml) improvement in mean FEV1 after broncho￾dilator in both treatment groups. Subsequently mean
FEV1 declined gradually in the fluticasone propionate
group whereas in the placebo group it fell within three
months to values before prednisolone treatment.
The annual rate of decline in FEV1 was 59 ml/year
in the placebo group and 50 ml/year in the fluticasone
propionate group (P = 0.16) (table 2). This small differ￾ence in slopes was uninfluenced by smoking status, age,
sex, or FEV1 response to the oral corticosteroid trial.

the fluticasone propionate group was 76 ml and 100
ml higher, respectively, than in the placebo group
(mixed effects model P < 0.001). The analysis of covari￾ance showed that FEV1 in the fluticasone propionate
group was higher than in the placebo group by at least
70 ml at each time point (P<0.001). There was no sig￾nificant relation between FEV1 response to oral
corticosteroid or fluticasone propionate (P = 0.056).
Exacerbations
The median yearly exacerbation rate was lower in the
fluticasone propionate group (0.99 per year) compared
with the placebo group (1.32 per year), a reduction of
25% in those receiving fluticasone propionate
(P = 0.026).
Health status
At baseline the total respiratory questionnaire score
was not significantly different between treatment
groups (table 1), and it did not change significantly
over the first six months of treatment (placebo: up 1.2
(SD 11.9); fluticasone propionate: down 0.5 (SD11.8);
P = 0.09). Thereafter it increased (that is, health status
declined) over time (figs 3 and 4). This increase was
linear (P < 0.0001). The respiratory questionnaire
score worsened at a faster rate (P = 0.004) with placebo
(3.2 units/year) than with fluticasone propionate (2.0
units/year).
Withdrawals
More patients in the placebo group than in the flutica￾sone propionate group withdrew because of respira￾tory disease that was not associated with malignancy
(25% v 19%, respectively; P = 0.034).
Safety
Reported events were similar between treatments
(table 3), except for a slightly higher incidence of events
related to inhaled glucocorticoid in the fluticasone
propionate group.
There was a significant (P<0.032) yet small decrease
in mean cortisol concentrations with fluticasone
propionate compared with placebo (table 4). No more
than 5% of patients on fluticasone propionate had
values below the normal range during the study at any
time. No decreases were associated with any signs or
symptoms of hypoadrenalism or other clinical effects.

Discussion
Inhaled corticosteroids have been used widely in the
United Kingdom for the empirical treatment of symp￾tomatic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but
evidence to support this practice is limited. Unlike
early reports,18 19 our study in moderate to severe
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease found no effect
of corticosteroids on the rate of decline in FEV1—a
finding consistent with two recent budesonide studies
in mild disease.9 10 Like Euroscop, a study in continued
smokers,10 we found a small improvement in FEV1 after
bronchodilator at three months, which was maintained
throughout the study. The clinical significance of this
change in airway function is unclear. Our study also
showed no significant relation between corticosteroid
trial response and response to long term inhaled
corticosteroid.
The exacerbation rate for placebo was similar to
that seen in previous reports,20 but for fluticasone pro￾pionate it was 25% lower. Precise definition of an exac￾erbation is difficult in ambulant patients with chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, but, by using the
operational approach adopted in ISOLDE, reductions
in exacerbation severity were seen in another study of
patients with moderately severe disease treated for six
months with fluticasone propionate.21 During the ISO￾LDE run-in we also observed that withdrawal of
inhaled corticosteroids was associated with an
increased likelihood of an exacerbation.22 These obser￾vations suggest that inhaled corticosteroids do modify
the risk of symptomatic deterioration in chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease.
Assessment of of health status is recognised as an
important additional measurement in patients with
chronic respiratory disease and is a better predictor of
admission to hospital and death within 12 months
than FEV1.
23 The baseline respiratory questionnaire
score showed significant impairment, in keeping with
other populations with similar reductions in FEV1.
13 14
This study shows for the first time that, like FEV1,
health status declines at a measurable rate in patients
with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmo￾nary disease. Fluticasone propionate significantly
reduced this rate of decline, delaying the average time
for a clinically important reduction in health status
from 15 to 24 months. As the respiratory questionnaire
has only a weak correlation with FEV1,
5 it must be
reflecting other disease components other than airflow
limitation.
Limitations
Several factors, including disease severity, comorbidity,
and study duration, contributed to the high withdrawal
rate. Patients were also actively withdrawn from the
study and not subsequently followed up if they experi￾Time from start of inhaled treatment (months)

enced frequent exacerbations; this is an acknowledged
limitation of the study. The effect of the differential rate
of withdrawal from treatment is difficult to quantify,
nevertheless it is likely to have led to a conservative
estimate of benefit with fluticasone propionate.
Reports of adverse events for each treatment were
generally similar, although the incidence of events
related to glucocorticoids was slightly higher in the flu￾ticasone propionate group. The incidence of fractures
was low (2%) and similar to that reported in
Euroscop.10 No more than 5% of patients on
fluticasone propionate had cortisol concentrations
below the normal range at any time during treatment.
Similar reassuring data have been reported from a two
year placebo controlled study of fluticasone propion￾ate 500 ìg twice daily in adults with mild asthma.24
Conclusions
We found no benefit of fluticasone propionate on the
rate of decline in FEV1, although small improvements
in FEV1 were seen. Unlike the two studies in patients
with milder disease, where other clinical outcomes
were less measurable,9 10 we found that fluticasone pro￾pionate 500 ìg twice daily significantly reduced
exacerbations and the rate of decline in health status.
These data provide a rationale for the current practice
of using use of inhaled corticosteroids at this dose in
patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease.

What is already known on this topic
Inhaled corticosteroids are widely prescribed for
patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, although there are few studies to support
this
A meta-analysis of three small studies showed
improvements in FEV1 with high dose
beclomethasone dipropionate or budesonide but
no benefit from medium dose treatment
In two recent large studies, budesonide in medium
dose produced either no benefit or a small initial
improvement in FEV1
What this study adds
This study measured progressive decline in health
status of patients with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease rather than just the FEV1
In patients with moderate to severe disease,
fluticasone propionate 1 mg daily resulted in fewer
exacerbations, a reduced rate of decline in health
status, and higher FEV1 values than placebo
treatment
Serious side effects were similar to placebo, topical
side effects were increased
These data provide a rationale for the use of high
dose inhaled corticosteroids in patients with
moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease

Comparing health inequality in men and women:
prospective study of mortality 1986-96
Amanda Sacker, David Firth, Ray Fitzpatrick, Kevin Lynch, Mel Bartley
Abstract
Objectives To study prospectively the differences in
health inequality in men and women from 1986-96
using the Office for National Statistics’ longitudinal
study and new socioeconomic classification. To assess
the relative importance of social class (based on
employment characteristics) and social position
according to the general social advantage of the
household to mortality risk in men and women.
Design Prospective study.
Setting England and Wales.
Subjects Men and women of working age at the time
of the 1981 census, with a recorded occupation.
Main outcome measures Mortality.
Results In men, social class based on employment
relations, measured according to the Office for National
Statistics’ socioeconomic classification, was the most
important influence on mortality. In women, social class
based on individual employment relations and
conditions showed only a weak gradient. Large
differences in risk of mortality in women were found,
however, when social position was measured according
to the general social advantage in the household.
Conclusions Comparisons of the extent of health
inequality in men and women are affected by the
measures of social inequality used. For women, even
those in paid work, classifications based on
characteristics of the employment situation may give a
considerable underestimate. The Office for National
Statistics’ new measure of socioeconomic position is
useful for assessing health inequality in men, but in
women a more important predictor of mortality is
inequality in general social advantage of the household.
Introduction
Social variation in morbidity and mortality in women
whose social position is measured according to their
own occupation is often found to be less than that of
men.1–4 The extent of social inequality in women’s
health is known to be particularly sensitive to the way
in which inequality is defined and measured.156 When
women’s social position is classified according to the
occupation of their male partners, male and female
health gradients are more similar.7 8 In estimates of
health inequality there is comparatively little discussion
of these apparent sex differences.
It is now possible to study sex differences in health
inequality with distinct validated measures of social
position and advantage, one based on relations and
conditions of employment and the other on material
cultural aspects of lifestyle outside the workplace. The
Office for National Statistics (ONS) has recently
adopted a new measure of social inequality: the ONS
socioeconomic classification, for use in the 2001 census
and official surveys.9 This measure allocates occupa￾tions to social classes on the basis of aspects of the work
situation, in particular the extent to which members of
an occupation have control over their own work and
that of others.
The other measure is the Cambridge scale, which is
based on general social and material advantage and
lifestyle as reflected in choices of friendship.10–12 Both
measures are being increasingly used in health studies
and have been found to be related to mortality,
morbidity, and health related behaviour.13–18
We aimed to determine whether social gradients in
mortality in women in England and Wales during
1986-96 were less noticeable than in men, and whether
this depended on the measure of social inequality
used.
Subjects and methods
Sample
The ONS longitudinal study is an approximate 1%
sample of the population of England and Wales. Sam￾pling was begun at the time of the 1971 census when
all those born on any one of four days in the year were
entered into the dataset. The study is regularly updated
to include new members born on any one of the four
designated dates.19 Vital events including mortality are
