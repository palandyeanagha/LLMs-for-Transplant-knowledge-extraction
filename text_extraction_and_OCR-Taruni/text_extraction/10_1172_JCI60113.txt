The skin interstitium sequesters excess Na+ and Cl– in salt-sensitive hypertension. Mononuclear phagocyte 
system (MPS) cells are recruited to the skin, sense the hypertonic electrolyte accumulation in skin, and activate 
the tonicity-responsive enhancer-binding protein (TONEBP, also known as NFAT5) to initiate expression and 
secretion of VEGFC, which enhances electrolyte clearance via cutaneous lymph vessels and increases eNOS 
expression in blood vessels. It is unclear whether this local MPS response to osmotic stress is important to 
systemic blood pressure control. Herein, we show that deletion of TonEBP in mouse MPS cells prevents the 
VEGFC response to a high-salt diet (HSD) and increases blood pressure. Additionally, an antibody that blocks 
the lymph-endothelial VEGFC receptor, VEGFR3, selectively inhibited MPS-driven increases in cutaneous 
lymphatic capillary density, led to skin Cl– accumulation, and induced salt-sensitive hypertension. Mice over￾expressing soluble VEGFR3 in epidermal keratinocytes exhibited hypoplastic cutaneous lymph capillaries and 
increased Na+, Cl–, and water retention in skin and salt-sensitive hypertension. Further, we found that HSD 
elevated skin osmolality above plasma levels. These results suggest that the skin contains a hypertonic intersti￾tial fluid compartment in which MPS cells exert homeostatic and blood pressure–regulatory control by local 
organization of interstitial electrolyte clearance via TONEBP and VEGFC/VEGFR3–mediated modification 
of cutaneous lymphatic capillary function.
Introduction
Mechanisms causing salt-sensitive hypertension are imperfectly 
defined (1). Guyton et al. attributed long-term blood pressure 
regulation to the kidney, arguing that blood flow, auto-regula￾tion, and pressure natriuresis control blood pressure (2, 3). This 
model suggests a close relationship among total body Na+, total 
body volume, and blood pressure. It assumes isosmolarity of body 
fluids among the bodily compartments (2). Along with others 
(4–7), we (8–14) showed earlier that electrolytes are distributed 
in a more complex 3-compartment model, in which intravascular 
and the interstitial fluids do not equilibrate as readily as believed 
(15, 16). We underscored the importance of Na+ binding to nega￾tively charged proteoglycans in the skin, the largest organ with 
the most extracellular space (8, 11). We suggested that, in addi￾tion to renal control, local extrarenal regulatory mechanisms for 
electrolyte clearance of interstitial fluid are operative to maintain 
extracellular electrolyte clearance and blood pressure. We postu￾lated that electrolyte accumulation in the skin occurs in excess 
of water and causes local hypertonicity. Mononuclear phagocyte 
system (MPS) cells respond to osmotic stress via the transcription 
factor tonicity-responsive enhancer-binding protein (TONEBP) 
that provokes a tissue-specific, MPS-driven, regulatory response 
(15, 16). MPS cells infiltrate the salt-overloaded interstitium, 
initiate TONEBP-driven VEGFC expression, and restructure the 
interstitial lymphatic capillary network, while increasing eNOS 
expression in blood vessels. Blocking this MPS-driven regulatory 
process leads to reduced cutaneous lymphatic capillary density, 
skin electrolyte accumulation, reduced eNOS expression in blood 
vessels, and increased blood pressure. The findings suggest that 
immune cells are regulators of internal environment and blood 
pressure homeostasis (15, 16).
Our model implies that the local skin microenvironment is 
hypertonic to plasma, that MPS cells dictate regulatory events via 
TONEBP, and that skin VEGFC is important for systemic blood 
pressure control. It was unclear whether MPS cells influence 
blood pressure via VEGFC/VEGFR3–driven lymphatic electrolyte 
clearance or perhaps by VEGFC/VEGFR2–driven modulation of 
eNOS expression. Furthermore, the relationship between Na+
and Cl– disposition in the microenvironment was also ill defined. 
Here, we show that selective depletion of TONEBP in MPS cells, 
blockade of VEGFR3 with antibody leaving VEGFR2 intact, and 
deletion of VEGFC signaling in skin all disrupt cutaneous lym￾Authorship note: Helge Wiig and Agnes Schröder contributed equally to this work.

phatic capillary architecture and result in predominantly Cl–
accumulation in the skin, which is paralleled by salt-sensitive 
hypertension. Finally, we document with several independent 
methods the hypertonic electrolyte concentrations of the inter￾stitial microenvironment in the skin. These findings strengthen 
our proposal of a third, locally regulated, skin fluid compartment 
relevant to systemic blood pressure regulation.
Results
Eliminating TONEBP in MPS cells reduces skin Cl– clearance and causes 
salt-sensitive hypertension. To understand the role of TONEBP in 
MPS cells in modulating lymphatic density and skin electrolyte 
storage, we investigated the TONEBP/VEGFC regulatory axis in 
mice with MPS cell–specific conditional TonEBP gene deletion 
(LysMcreTonEBPfl/fl mice). We first harvested macrophages from 
LysMWTTonEBPfl/fl mice (without TONEBP deficiency) and from 
LysMcreTonEBPfl/fl mice (with TONEBP deficiency). We exposed 
the cells to standard cell culture medium, to NaCl-mediated 
osmotic stress, or urea-mediated hyperosmolality (Supplemental 
Figure 1; supplemental material available online with this article; 
doi:10.1172/JCI60113DS1). Increasing NaCl, which is an effective 
osmolyte, caused increased TONEBP expression in macrophages 
without TONEBP deficiency. In contrast, primary bone mar￾row macrophages from LysMcreTonEBPfl/fl mice showed reduced 
TONEBP protein expression under normal cell culture medium 
conditions and with NaCl-mediated osmotic stress. We also tested 
TonEBP mRNA expression in vivo in the mice at various organs. 
The mice all received high-salt diet (HSD) to induce electrolyte 
storage. The only tissue in which we found a genotype-dependent 
decrease in TonEBP mRNA expression was the skin (Supplemen￾tal Figure 1). These findings suggest that MPS/TONEBP–driven 
responses to HSD are particularly manifest in the skin.
To further substantiate this hypothesis, we next tested whether 
or not MPS-specific TONEBP depletion abolishes TONEBP/
VEGFC–driven increases in cutaneous lymphatic capillary density 
in response to skin electrolyte storage. Similar to FVB strain mice 
(genetic background control), LysMWTTonEBPfl/fl mice fed HSD 
showed increased lymphatic capillary density (Figure 1A). How￾ever, no increase occurred in LysMcreTonEBPfl/fl mice with MPS-spe￾cific deletion of TonEBP gene. Western blotting (Figure 1B) con￾firmed that VEGFC protein expression in LysMcreTonEBPfl/fl mice 
was reduced compared with that in the two controls. Statistical

analysis (Figure 1C) showed significant reduction in TonEBP and 
Vegfc mRNA and protein levels in LysMcreTonEBPfl/fl mouse skin, 
while CD68 expression reflecting macrophage infiltration was 
unaffected. The resulting decrease in cutaneous lymphatic capil￾lary density was paralleled by a salt-sensitive increase in mean arte￾rial blood pressure (MAP) in LysMcreTonEBPfl/fl mice.
In skin (Figure 1D), Cl– content and concentration were both 
increased in LysMcreTonEBPfl/fl mice, while no differences were 
observed in plasma. We found no significant differences in skin 
Na+ content and skin water content between LysMWTTonEBPfl/fl
and LysMcreTonEBPfl/fl mice. Disaccharide analysis of skin glycos￾aminoglycans (GAGs) showed no differences in GAG charge den￾sity between LysMcreTonEBPfl/fl and LysMWTTonEBPfl/fl mice (Figure 
1E). These data show that MPS cell–specific TONEBP depletion 
blocks VEGFC-driven increases in cutaneous lymphatic capil￾lary density after HSD. Absence of increased lymphatic capillary 
density resulted in Cl– retention in the skin and increased MAP. 
We conclude that MPS cells locally regulate skin Cl– content by a 
TONEBP-dependent mechanism.
Anti-VEGFR3 treatment causes skin-Cl– retention and salt-sensitive 
hypertension. We next performed experiments with anti-VEGFR3 
antibodies to specifically block MPS/TONEBP/VEGFC–driven 
lymphatic capillary hyperplasia distal to TONEBP. As shown pre￾viously, HSD increased lymphatic capillary density in mice (Figure 
2A), which was paralleled by increased CD68 and VEGFC expres￾sion (Figure 2B) and increased phosphorylated eNOS (p-eNOS) 
expression (Figure 2B). Treatment with the mF4-31c1 anti-VEGFR3 
antibody blocked the skin lymphatic capillary response to HSD 
completely (Figure 2A and Table 1) but not the MPS cell count, 
CD68 expression, or p-eNOS expression. The mF4-31c1 treatment 
in mice fed HSD resulted in increased infiltration of VEGFC￾positive cells into the cutaneous interstitium. These data sug￾gest that MPS cells responded to VEGFR3 blockade in an effort 
to restructure the lymphatic capillary network when challenged 
with HSD. While treatment with the anti-VEGFR3 antibody abol￾ished the increased lymphatic capillary density after HSD, mF4-
31c1 treatment did not change eNOS and p-eNOS expression. We 
conclude that mF4-31c1 did not interfere with the MPS/VEGFC/

VEGFR2/eNOS signaling pathway. Because blockade of VEGFC/
VEGFR3–driven lymphatic capillary hyperplasia was paralleled 
by a 17-mmHg increase in MAP (Figure 2C), the data suggest that 
the unopposed MPS/VEGFC/VEGFR2/eNOS signaling pathway, 
which had a MPS-driven increase in eNOS and p-eNOS expression 
(Figure 2B and Table 1) in the same mice, was not able to buffer 
blood pressure in mice in which the VEGFC/VEGFR3 interaction 
was blocked. Without HSD, mF4-31c1 did not increase blood pres￾sure (Figure 2C). We determined skin lymphatic capillary density 
with whole-mount staining in each mouse (Supplemental Figure 2) 
and assessed the relationship between lymphatic capillary density 
and MAP (Figure 2D). We found that MAP increases were inversely 
related to lymphatic capillary density in the skin. Complete block￾ade of the increased skin lymphatic capillary density resulted in the 
highest MAP values, while less complete blockade resulted in lower 
MAP responses to HSD. The finding that blood pressure and lym￾phatic capillary density are inversely correlated after HSD suggests 
that skin electrolyte clearance through cutaneous lymph capillaries 
could be coupled with systemic blood pressure.
We therefore next tested whether or not salt-sensitive blood pres￾sure increases after VEGFR3 blockade were paralleled by electro￾lyte and water retention in the skin. Blocking VEGFC/VEGFR3 
interaction resulted in higher skin Cl– content (Figure 2E and 
Table 2) and increased skin Cl– concentrations (Figure 2F and 
Table 2). Both were inversely correlated with lymphatic capillary 
density. In contrast, mF4-31c1 treatment neither increased skin 
Na+ nor skin water content in the same mice (Table 2 and Supple￾mental Figure 3). These findings suggest that MPS/VEGFC–driven 
hyperplasia of cutaneous lymph capillaries specifically promotes 
clearance of Cl– from skin tissue and that this clearance process 
might be coupled with blood pressure.
To test this hypothesis further, we next investigated the relation￾ship between skin Na+ and Cl– content and blood pressure in each 
individual mouse fed HSD. The mF4-31c1 treatment increased 
MAP and skin Cl– content (Figure 3A) but not skin Na+ content 
(Figure 3B). Compared with low-salt diet (LSD), HSD increased 
skin Na+ and Cl– content 
(Figure 3C). Additional 
m F 4 - 3 1 c 1 t r e a t m e n t 
increased Cl – further 
but not Na+. Expressing 
the data as skin Cl–/Na+
(Figure 3C) underscores 
the finding that absence 
of MPS/VEGFC–driven 
hyperplasia of cutaneous 
lymph capillaries resulted 
in selective Cl– retention 
in skin tissue. The salt￾sensitive blood pressure 
increase with mF4-31c1 
treatment was associated 
neither with increases in 
skin Na+ content (Figure 
3B) nor with changes in 
skin water content (Sup￾plemental Figure 4). In 
contrast, increased MAP 
in the mF4-31c1–treated 
mice was paralleled by 
increased skin Cl– content (Figure 3C) and with increased skin Cl–
-to-water ratio (Supplemental Figure 4). These findings suggest 
that the salt-sensitive blood pressure increase was neither Na+ nor 
volume related, but rather Cl– dependent. We therefore inspected 
the relationship between skin Na+, Cl–, and water in more detail. 
In HSD control mice, increased Na+ and Cl– content resulted in 
increased skin water content, underscoring the role of these effec￾tive osmolytes to control body fluid content (Figure 3D). How￾ever, skin Cl– content remained more than 2-fold lower than skin 
Na+ content, indicating an important role of unmeasured anionic 
osmolytes for maintenance of fluid tonicity and electroneutrality. 
Additional blockade of VEGFC/VEGFR3–driven lymphatic capil￾lary hyperplasia changed this relationship substantially (Figure 
3D). In HSD mice given mF4-31c1 treatment, Cl– was accumulated 
in the skin without commensurate water retention. The resulting 
rightward shift of the skin Cl–-to-water ratio (Figure 3D) further 
increased skin Cl– concentration (Figure 3D and Table 2). Because 
these changes were Cl–-specific, while skin Na+ content did not 
change, we conclude that when the mF4-31c1 antibody prevents 
the increase in lymphatic capillary density, the amount of unmea￾sured anionic osmolytes in skin fluid is reduced. These data sug￾gest that MPS/TONEBP/VEGFC–driven increases in lymphatic 
capillary density facilitate Cl– clearance from skin tissue and that 
extrarenal Cl– removal, rather than skin Na+ and water clearance, is 
tightly linked to blood pressure regulation (Supplemental Video 1).
Skin VEGFC depletion reduces electrolyte clearance and increases blood 
pressure. To test the hypothesis that skin VEGFC is relevant for skin 
electrolyte clearance and blood pressure, we performed additional 
experiments in K14-FLT4 mice designed to block the effect of 
VEGFC in the skin (17). These transgenic mice overexpress soluble 
VEGFR3 (sVEGFR3, also known as FLT4) in skin keratinocytes, 
which increases sVEGFR3 levels, resulting in a VEGFC trap that 
results in hypoplasia of skin lymph capillaries (17) but not of renal 
lymph vessels (Supplemental Figure 5). While WT mice showed 
increased MPS cell count only with HSD, we found higher MPS cell 
counts in K14-FLT4 mice even with LSD (Figure 4A and Table 3).

Moreover, K14-FLT4 mice exhibited cutaneous lymphatic capil￾lary hypoplasia (Figure 4B and Table 3) and had higher eNOS 
and phosphorylated blood capillary eNOS expression after both 
LSD and HSD (Figure 4, C and D). Unlike that in WT mice (Fig￾ure 4, D and E, and Table 3), HSD did not increase lymphatic 
capillary density and p-eNOS expression in K14-FLT4 mice. 
This situation was paralleled by a 1.5-fold increase in skin Na+
content and more than a 2-fold increase in Cl– content in the 
skin of K14-FLT4 mice fed HSD (Table 2). Furthermore, salt￾sensitive hypertension resulted (Figure 4E). The data suggest 
that selective trapping of skin VEGFC by sVEGFR3 blocks the 
VEGFC-dependent electrolyte clearance from skin tissue in K14-
FLT4 mice and induces salt-sensitive hypertension (Supplemen￾tal Video 1), illustrating a further link between skin electrolyte 
homeostasis and blood pressure regulation.
Verifying interstitial hypertonicity in salt-sensitive hypertension in 
rats. Our experiments in mice with deletion of TONEBP in MPS 
cells suggest that the skin microenvironment is characterized 
by osmotic stress, suggesting osmotic gradients between blood 
plasma and the interstitial fluid matrix. To further support 
this hypothesis, we aimed to document the hypothesis that 
interstitial osmolality can be higher than that in plasma and 
investigated rats for this purpose. In line with our experiments 
in mice, HSD in rats showed no effect on plasma Na+ and Cl–
concentrations or osmolality but increased skin Na+ and Cl–
content and concentration, as determined by chemical analysis 
(Figure 5A). In parallel with skin Na+ storage, TonEBP and Vegfc
mRNA expressions, as well as MPS cell count, increased in the 
skin (Figure 5B). The rats developed a salt-sensitive increase in 
MAP and in interstitial fluid pressure, the latter representing a 
driving force for lymph flow (18). To probe for electrolyte com￾position in prenodal lymph capillaries, we additionally induced 
pronounced skin Na+ storage in rats by deoxycorticosterone 
acetate treatment. We then measured electrolyte concentra￾tions using energy-dispersive x-ray electron microprobe analy￾sis of primary lymph vessels, which drain interstitial fluid (Fig￾ure 5C). We found substantially higher Na+ concentrations in 
lymph capillaries than in blood plasma from the carotid artery, 
while differences in Cl– concentrations did not reach statistical 
significance under these conditions with this technique. We also 
tested whether or not we could find higher electrolyte concen￾trations in microdialysate from skin. We found that Na+ con￾centrations and osmolality were higher in microdialysate from 
skin than in blood plasma (Figure 5D); however, we identified 
no statistically significant differences in dialysate electrolyte 
concentrations between rats fed LSD or HSD (Supplemental 
Table 1). Finally, we measured osmolality in snap-frozen skin 
samples compared with that in plasma. HSD increased skin 
osmolality by approximately 20 mOsmol/kg H2O, while plasma 
values were unchanged (Figure 5E). Despite some inter-method￾ological differences, these data, derived from four distinct meth￾odological approaches, suggest that HSD leads to Na+ and Cl–
storage in the skin, resulting in increased interstitial osmolality 
and osmotic stress in the skin microenvironment. The osmotic 
stress activates TONEBP in MPS cells and drives VEGFC gene 
expression in the immune cells.
Discussion
To verify the role of MPS cells in regulating interstitial electro￾lyte concentrations, we genetically induced TONEBP deficiency

in MPS cells. TONEBP binds to the VEGFC promoter and increases 
VEGFC expression in MPS cells in vitro (16). In vivo, reduced skin 
TONEBP expression in LysMcreTonEBPfl/fl mice fed HSD was directly 
coupled with reduced VEGFC expression. VEGFC binds to VEGFR3 
on lymph endothelial cells and increases lymphatic capillary den￾sity in mice with Na+- and Cl–-overloaded skin (15, 16). We found 
that deletion of MPS cell TONEBP blocked the expected increase 
in lymphatic capillary density in response to skin electrolyte stor￾age-induced osmotic stress. Skin electrolyte composition analysis 
showed increased skin Cl– content in LysMcreTonEBPfl/fl mice. In con￾trast, MPS-specific TONEBP deletion did not change skin Na+ and 
water content in the mice. We conclude that TONEBP is necessary 
to enable MPS cells to signal a VEGFC-dependent increase in cuta￾neous lymphatic capillary density and induces local Cl– clearance. 
Our data indicate that TONEBP is an essential component by which 
MPS cells regulate extracellular fluid composition.
Our additional experiments with an antibody directed against 
VEGFR3 (mF4-31c1), to selectively block the VEGFC/VEGFR3–
mediated increase in lymphatic capillary density, allowed us to 
investigate homeostatic regulation of local electrolyte clearance 
distal to TONEBP-mediated VEGFC expression. These experi￾ments were designed to test the hypothesis that lymph capillaries 
are relevant for systemic blood pressure regulation. We found that 
the antibody eliminated the lymphatic capillary density response 
but not the increased eNOS and p-eNOS expression in response to 
HSD. Thus, we were able to eliminate diminished eNOS produc￾tion as the responsible mechanism for increased blood pressure in 
response to HSD. Similar to our findings with specific TONEBP 
deletion in MPS cells, the most robust inverse correlations between 
lymphatic capillary density and skin electrolyte content were 
with skin Cl–, rather than Na+ concentrations. Our comparisons 
between skin Na+ and Cl– content suggest that this Cl– accumu￾lation is paralleled by a commensurate reduction of unmeasured 
anionic osmolytes. We speculate that a hyperplastic cutaneous 
lymphatic capillary network secretes increased amounts of neg￾atively charged organic molecules (such as GAGs) into the skin 
interstitium. It is unclear to us why skin Cl– content, and not Na+
and water content, was so tightly associated with salt-sensitive 
blood pressure increases in our mice. Recently, evidence from our 
group suggests that skin Na+ and Cl– storage in rats is associated 
with increased in vitro contractility of skin resistance vessels (19). 
We speculate that changes in interstitial Cl– ion concentration, or 
unidentified organic components secreted by the lymphatic capil￾lary network or immune cells, may modify vascular resistance in 
the skin and increase blood pressure. The steep inverse relation￾ship between blood pressure and skin lymphatic capillary density 
in our anti-VEGFR3 experiments supports the idea that the lym￾phatic capillary endothelium could secrete factors relevant for sys￾temic blood pressure regulation.
To address our hypothesis that lymphatic regulation of electro￾lyte composition in the skin is relevant for systemic blood pres￾sure control, we also tested skin electrolyte homeostasis and blood 
pressure in a transgenic model that functionally eliminates skin 
VEGFC and thereby disrupts cutaneous lymph capillaries (17). 
HSD in K14-FLT4 mice led to pronounced Na+, Cl–, and water 
retention in the skin, which was paralleled by increased blood pres￾Figure 3

sure. The blood pressure results of these experiments are in accord 
with those obtained using the antibody directed against VEGFR3 
and confirmed our initial hypothesis. Na+, Cl–, and water reten￾tion in the skin accompanied the increased blood pressure in K14-
FLT4 mice. In contrast, blockade of MPS/VEGFC/VEGFR3–driven 
hyperplasia of skin lymph capillaries in WT mice resulted in selec￾tive tissue Cl– retention, which was paralleled by hypertension, even 
in the absence of parallel Na+ and water accumulation in skin. We 
interpret these findings to indicate that preexisting hypoplasia in 
cutaneous lymph capillaries in K14-FLT4 mice results in expected 
parallel electrolyte and volume retention with HSD, while HSD￾induced hyperplasia of intact cutaneous lymph capillaries seems 
to specifically enhance clearance of Cl– from tissue. The underlying 
mechanisms responsibly for this Cl– specificity are unknown.
Finally, we show that HSD results in Na+ and Cl– storage in the 
skin in rats and in mice. This electrolyte storage is not associated 
with commensurate water retention, and skin electrolyte storage 
is not entirely osmotically inactive but instead increases osmolal￾ity. We used 5 separate approaches to substantiate our hypotheses. 
First, chemical analysis showed increases in skin Na+ and Cl– con￾tent, without commensurate increases in tissue water. This find￾ing suggests that electrolytes are stored in tissue, either by binding 
to negatively charged matrix components (GAGs) or by exerting 
hyperosmolality (4–6, 11, 13). Second, electron microprobe analysis 
provided the first measurements of electrolyte concentrations in 
prenodal skin lymph vessels, demonstrating that Na+ concentra￾tions in pericapillary interstitial skin fluid are substantially higher 
than those in plasma (20). Third, skin microdialysis experiments 
showed increased Na+ concentrations and higher osmolality in 
microdialysate compared with that in plasma. Fourth, direct vapor 
pressure measurements of plasma and skin showed that HSD 
increased tissue osmolality. Fifth, TONEBP, which induces expres￾sion of VEGFC from MPS cells in response to osmotic stress, was 
concomitantly expressed with skin electrolyte storage, indicating a 
hypertonic microenvironment. These 5 independent observations, 
in line with findings of other investigators (5, 7), lead us to conclude 
that salt storage in the skin is characterized by a local hypertonic 
microenvironment. The resulting osmotic stress triggers homeo￾static macrophages to exert their regulatory activity and modulate 
interstitial electrolyte composition by TONEBP/VEGFC–driven 
modulation of cutaneous lymphatic capillary function, which may 
include enhanced pumping activity of the lymph vessels (21).
This series of events suggests that MPS cells regulate skin inter￾stitial electrolyte homeostasis. MPS cells constitute a subgroup 
of monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells that respond to 
infection or tissue damage to restore the integrity of the body (22). 
Macrophages exhibit a phenotypic continuum, with overlapping 
functions ranging from classically activated macrophages to alter￾natively activated, wound healing, and regulatory macrophages 
(23). While classically activated macrophages protect against

fungi, bacteria, and viruses, they contribute to extracellular matrix 
destruction and tissue damage. However, the cells of the MPS not 
only combat invading pathogens, but also orchestrate an antiin￾flammatory milieu, in which proinflammatory activation is inhib￾ited while expression profiles promoting cell proliferation, tissue 
repair, extracellular matrix construction, and angiogenesis are 
expanded (24–26). In addition to these classical immunological 
roles, our evidence suggests that MPS cells are empowered to play 
an important homeostatic role to maintain the steady-state elec￾trolyte composition of the tissue. Our findings support the notion 
of “homeostatic immune function” dating back to the work of 
Metchnikoff, demonstrating that macrophages play a central role 
in tissue development (27).
The idea that lymph capillaries are relevant for blood pressure 
control (15, 16, 28) might shed new light on the current discussion 
on how VEGF kinase inhibitors may elevate blood pressure (29, 30). 
Blood capillary rarefaction (31–34) or reduced eNOS expression 
(35–43) as well as lymphatic capillary rarefaction may lead to arte￾rial hypertension in patients treated with angiogenesis inhibitors. 
In contrast to selective VEGFR2 blockade (44), however, the hyper￾tension induced by VEGFR3 blockade in our mice was strictly salt 
sensitive. Dietary salt restriction therefore may serve to lower blood 
pressure in patients treated with angiogenesis inhibitors.
Current concepts on lymphatic function rely on the idea that 
changes in lymphatic morphology may modulate lymphatic 
pumping and thereby interstitial flow (18, 21, 45–51). Our data 
suggest that MPS cells may modulate lymphatic function by not 
only changing the quantity of lymph flow, but also by altering the 
relationship among electrolytes, water, and tonicity of interstitial 
fluids. The resulting change in the relationship between tissue 
electrolyte and water contents in the skin resembles the intersti￾tial changes in the renal medulla (20), in which specialized tubu￾lar segments provide active transport mechanisms. As a result, 
segmental impermeability for water and countercurrents creates 
a local hypertonic interstitial microenvironment. In the kidney, 
this hypertonic interstitial microenvironment modifies urinary 
concentration to maintain a constant internal composition of the 
blood. While the physiological processes and molecular mecha￾nisms involved are elusive, the presence of electrolyte transporters 
in skin lymph endothelial cells (52), combined with endothelial 
tight junctions in lymph 
collecting vessels (53–55), 
suggests that blood vascular 
countercurrents and lymph 
vessels in the skin may form 
a functional network for 
local regulation of internal 
environmental composition 
and blood pressure control.
Despite substantial MPS/
VEGFC–driven changes in 
the dermal lymphatic cap￾illary network, we found 
no activation of the MPS/
TONEBP/VEGFC regulatory 
axis in the kidney after HSD. 
We also observed no changes 
in renal VEGFC expression 
in LysMcreTonEBPfl/fl mice. 
Furthermore, TonEBP gene 
expression in LysMcreTonEBPfl/fl mice was reduced in skin but not 
in kidney. We also observed no abnormalities in renal lymph ves￾sels in K14-FLT4 mice. The renal inner medulla lacks lymphatic 
vessels that evidently are not necessary for fluid transport from 
the medulla to the cortex (56). Finally, in experiments with genetic 
depletion of the TONEBP/VEGFC regulatory axis in MPS cells 
and in experiments antagonizing lymph vessel formation with 
VEGFR3 blockade during HSD, we found selective Cl– accumula￾tion in the skin, a direct correlation between skin Cl– content and 
blood pressure increases, and no relationship between Na+ and 
water content and blood pressure but a massive increase in skin 
Cl– concentration. In contrast, plasma Cl– concentration, which is 
undoubtedly under exclusive renal control, was not perturbed in 
the same mice. The findings suggest that MPS cells exert homeo￾static immune function by extrarenal control of interstitial elec￾trolyte composition via skin lymph capillaries.
In summary, we have elucidated an interstitial environment that 
is hypertonic to the plasma compartment. MPS cells outfitted with 
TONEBP can detect this local osmotic stress when aggravated by 
HSD. The local signaling regulates lymphatic capillary density. We 
hypothesize that an additional biological clearance system exists 
in the skin interstitium, which is necessary to protect tissues from 
electrolyte overload. In contrast to the view that renal electrolyte 
elimination is sufficient for the control of the internal environ￾ment (57–59), MPS-driven lymphatic capillary hyperplasia pro￾vides an additional extrarenal regulatory component. Na+ reten￾tion with other accompanying anions than Cl– does not increase 
blood pressure (14, 60–65). We are intrigued by the observation 
that tissue Cl– content was directly related to blood pressure in 
that regard. We are aware that these studies do not explain why 
peripheral vascular resistance in skin vessels is increased in salt￾consuming animals (19). Although we believe that our findings 
regarding lymphatic capillary density and its importance to skin 
electrolyte clearance are relevant to this process, future research 
must pursue this issue further. Finally, we have the impression 
that our findings are directly clinically relevant. Our long-term 
observations on Na+ balance in humans (66), showing infradian 
rhythms of Na+ storage, independent of body weight or blood pres￾sure, are consistent with the interstitial electrolyte storage that we 
observed in our animal studies. We have since implemented 23Na

magnetic resonance imaging techniques to make Na+ storage vis￾ible in animals and patients (67, 68) and have shown that essential 
hypertension in humans is paralleled by tissue Na+ storage (69).
Methods
Experiments in mice. For the investigation of TONEBP deficiency in MPS 
cells, we had TonEBPfl/fl mice generated by inGenious Targeting Laboratory 
Inc. using standard gene-targeting techniques (Supplemental Figure 6). The 
targeting construct was designed such that the short homology arm extends 
about 2.45 kb 3′ to exon 4, whereas the long homology arm extends about 
5.25 kb 5′ to exon 4. A single LoxP site, containing an engineered StuI site 
for Southern blot analysis, was inserted 166 bp upstream of exon 4, and a 
LoxP/FRT flanked Neo cassette was inserted 202 bp downstream of exon 4. 
Thus, the target region is 561 bp long and includes exon 4. BA1 (C57BL/6 
× 129/SvEv) hybrid embryonic stem cells were electroporated with 10 μg of 
linearized targeting vector and selected with G418 antibiotic. Four PCR￾positive clones were further confirmed by Southern blot analysis. Tar￾geted iTL BA1 (C57BL/6N × 129/SvEv) hybrid embryonic stem cells were 
microinjected into C57BL/6 blastocysts. Resulting chimeras, with a high 
percentage agouti coat color, were mated to C57BL/6 homozygous FLP 
mice to remove the Neo cassette. For standard genotyping of the offspring, 
we used primers 5′-GTTGTGCTTTGGATTCTCAGAAC-3′ and 5′-CTTC￾TACCCTTCTATTTCAGGAAGC-3′, which amplified a 675-bp fragment in 
case successful Neo deletion occurs. Finally, we crossbred LysMcreTonEBPfl/fl
mice with LysMWTTonEBPfl/fl mice to generate male LysMcreTonEBPfl/fl mice 
(n = 16) and LysMWTTonEBPfl/fl mice (n = 12), which were fed a HSD (4% 
NaCl chow plus 0.9% saline to drink) for 2 weeks to investigate differences 
in expression of their TONEBP/VEGFC regulatory axis.
For the selective blockade of VEGFC/VEGFR3–driven hyperplasia of 
lymph vessels, we randomly assigned 44 male FVB mice (Charles River) aged

10–12 weeks to 4 groups. Groups 1 and 2 received a LSD (<0.1% NaCl chow) 
and tap water. Groups 3 and 4 received a HSD (4% NaCl chow plus 0.9% 
saline to drink). Groups 2 and 4 were additionally treated with 45 μg mF4-
31c1 per g body weight i.p. every 48 hours (provided by ImClone Systems).
For the skin-specific genetic depletion of VEGFC, we used 14 male WT 
and 12 male mice with heterozygous overexpression of sVEGFR3 under 
the control of the keratinocyte promoter K14 (17). K14-FLT4 mice over￾express sVEGFR3 in their skin, resulting in hypoplasia of the subcutane￾ous lymphatic capillary system (17, 70). WT and K14-FLT4 mice were ran￾domly assigned to 4 groups. Groups 1 and 2 received a LSD. Groups 3 and 
4 received a HSD. In all experiments with mice, we kept the mice on their 
specified diets for 2 weeks. Mouse diets were from Altrominy. At the end 
of the experiment, we anesthetized the mice with 1.5% to 2% isoflurane 
anesthesia and catheterized the common carotid artery. We connected 
arterial lines to BP Transducers and a PowerLab 8/30 Channel Recorder 
(ADInstruments) and measured MAP in conscious animals 1 hour after 
the operation. Thereafter, we took blood samples and sacrificed the ani￾mals. We analyzed arterial blood gases with a clinical blood gas analyzer 
(Radiometer Copenhagen), including Na+, K+, and Cl– measurements 
by ion-selective electrodes.
Experiments in rats. We obtained 20 male Sprague Dawley rats (12 weeks 
of age) that were assigned to a LSD (<0.1% NaCl and tap water) and a HSD 
(8% NaCl and 0.9% saline water to drink) for 2 weeks. Chow was obtained 
from Altromin. We then characterized skin electrolyte accumulation by 
chemical analysis, MAP, skin interstitial fluid pressure, and gene expres￾sion of the TONEBP/VEGFC regulatory axis in the same animals. For the 
electron microprobe electrolyte measurements in primary lymph vessels, 
we used 3 deoxycorticosterone acetate–treated rats (50 mg/pellet) that 
received 1% saline water to drink for 3 consecutive weeks. For the micro￾dialysis of skin interstitial fluid determinations, we assigned 20 male rats 
to 2 groups and fed them LSD or HSD for 2 consecutive weeks. To directly 
measure skin tissue osmolality, we assigned 12 male rats to 2 groups and 
fed them LSD or HSD for 2 consecutive weeks.
Cell culture experiments. We isolated bone marrow–derived macrophages 
from LysMWTTonEBPfl/fl and LysMcreTonEBPfl/fl mice, as reported previously 
(71). Briefly, total bone marrow cells were cultured in hydrophobic Teflon 
bags (DuPont, purchased via Cadillac Plastic) with 10% CO2/ 90% humidi￾fied air in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented 
with 0.05 mmol/l 2-ME, 1% nonessential amino acids, 10% fetal calf serum 
(PAA), 5% horse serum (Cell Concepts), and 15% L929 cell-conditioned 
medium. After 8 days of culture, the cell population regularly contained 
more than 90% macrophages (CD11bhiF4/80hi). We then stimulated the 
primary macrophages by increasing the culture medium osmolality by 
adding 40 mM NaCl or 80 mM urea for 24 hours.
Chemical analysis of tissue electrolyte and water content. We completely 
skinned the carcasses. We separately weighed the completely skinned 
carcasses and skin (wet weight) and then desiccated both at 90°C for 72 
hours (dry weight [DW]). Because weights were unchanged with further 
drying, the difference between wet weight and DW was considered as tis￾sue water content. We then ashed the tissues at 190°C and 450°C for 
24 hours at each temperature level and sieved the bones from the car￾cass ashes. We further ashed the separated tissues at 600°C for 48 hours 
and then dissolved them in 5% or 10% HNO3. We measured Na+ and K+
concentration by atomic adsorption spectrometry (Model 3100, Perkin 
Elmer) and Cl– concentration by titration with 0.1 N silver nitrate (Model 
Titrando, German Metrohm).
Electron microprobe analysis. Electron microprobe analysis was performed 
by energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, as described previously (20). Tis￾sue from the rat ear was shock frozen in an isopentane/propane mixture 
(1:4) at –196°C, small pieces were subsequently mounted in a precooled 
ultracryomicrotome (modified Ultrotome V, LKB), and 1-μm-thick cryo￾sections were cut at –80°C. The sections were sandwiched between 2 
films (formvar and collodium) and subsequently freeze-dried at –80°C 
and 10-4 Pa. X-ray microanalysis was performed in a scanning transmis￾sion electron microscope (S 150, Cambridge Instruments) equipped with 
an energy-dispersive x-ray–detecting system (Link Systems). Small areas 
(1 μm2) in the vessels devoid of erythrocytes (presumably lymphatic ves￾sels) were analyzed using an acceleration voltage of 20 kV and a probe 
current of 0.3 nA. The preparation and electron microprobe analysis of 
freeze-dried cryosections and the quantification of the x-ray spectra have 
been described previously (72).
Measurement of tissue and plasma osmolality. Osmolality in skin samples was 
measured using a method slightly modified from that described by Torn￾heim (73) and Knepper (74). Immediately after terminating the experi￾ment, the rat back skin was closely clipped, removed, and snap frozen in 
liquid nitrogen. Frozen samples were wrapped in aluminum foil and trans￾ferred to double plastic bags to prevent evaporation and stored at –20°C 
until analysis. At the day of analysis, samples were transferred to dry ice. 
Skin discs were prepared with a cork bore, 7.5 mm, and chilled on dry ice, 
and discs were again wrapped in plastic foil and stored on dry ice. From 
these, 0.5-mm-thick discs were cut using a chilled tissue slicer (Thomas 
Stadie-Riggs Tissue Slicer, Thomas Scientific); immediately after cutting, 
they were transferred to the sample chamber of the osmometer (5500 Wes￾cor vapor pressure osmometer, Wescor Inc.) that had been calibrated with 
standards 50–850 mOsmol/l. Reported values are the average of 3 to 5 indi￾vidual samples, and the calibration was checked after each rat. Similarly, we 
determined osmolality in plasma from blood samples from the same rats 
by vapor pressure osmometry.
Measurement of interstitial fluid pressure. During experiment 4, we mea￾sured interstitial fluid pressure in the skin and intraarterial blood pres￾sure simultaneously in anesthetized rats (1.5%–2% isoflurane anesthesia; 
n = 4 per salt diet). We measured interstitial fluid pressure by micropunc￾ture technique, as described in detail previously (75). A sharpened glass 
capillary (diameter; 4–7 μm) connected to an automatic counterpressure 
system was inserted through intact back skin. We simultaneously moni￾tored intraarterial blood pressure after cannulation of the common carotid 
artery as described above in the mouse experiments.
Microdialysis. We anesthetized rats with 1.5% to 2% isoflurane anesthesia 
and placed intracutaneous microdialysis probes (20MD Elite Probe, CMA 
Microdialysis) in neck skin and cannulated the common carotid artery. 
We then perfused probes with Ringer’s solution at flow rate of 2.1 μl/min 
for 1 hour for equilibration. We then reduced flow rate to 0.3 μl/min and 
collected the microdialysate for 4 hours.
Real-time PCR. We extracted total RNA from animal tissue with RNeasy 
minicolumns (Qiagen), homogenizing skin slices (~10–20 mg) in 500 μl 
RLT buffer reagent with an Ultra-Turrax for 30 seconds. After homogeniza￾tion, we added 950 μl water and 16 μl proteinase K (25 U/μl) and incubated 
the sample at 55°C for 10 minutes and then centrifuged it at 13,500 g for 
3 minutes. After addition of 1 ml 96%–100% ethanol, we transferred the 
solvent to the mini-columns and eluted according to the standard proto￾col. First-strand cDNA was synthesized with TaqMan RT reagents (Applied 
Biosystems), with random hexamers used as primers. We performed real￾time PCR with an ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detector and SYBR green 
reagents (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s instruc￾tions. Primers used for amplification are shown in Supplemental Figure 1. 
All samples were run in duplicate. We normalized the relative amount of 
the specific mRNA of interest with respect to 18S rRNA content in the 
sample. Dissociation curves confirmed the specificity of the PCR.
Quantification of protein expression. For protein purification, cells were 
washed 3 times with PBS and incubated in 8 M urea, including protease

inhibitors, for 10 minutes on ice. We then removed the cells from plates 
and centrifuged cells for 10 minutes at 16,000 g. The supernatant was used 
for immunoblot analysis. We homogenized cells and matrix proteins from 
shock-frozen skin in 500 μl lysis buffer (50 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mM 
NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 50 μg/ml sodium 
pyrophosphate, 100 mM sodium fluoride, 0.01% aprotinin, 4 μg/ml pep￾statin A, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) 
with an Ultra-Turrax for 30 seconds.
Immunoblot. For immunoblotting, we separated equal amounts of total 
protein on 8% or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions 
and electroblotted onto a PVDF membrane. We blocked the blots with 5% 
nonfat milk in PBS and 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.5, for 1 hour at room temper￾ature and then incubated them overnight at 4°C with anti-TONEBP (ABR) 
diluted 1:1,000; anti-CD68 (Serotec) diluted 1:1,000; anti-VEGFC (Abcam) 
diluted 1:1,000; eNOS (Anaspec) diluted 1:500; p-eNOS (Ser1177; Cell 
Signaling) diluted 1:500; or β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted 1:5,000. After 
3 washes in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.5, we incubated the blots for 
1 hour with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody 
(Pierce) diluted 1:1,000 in blocking solution at room temperature. We 
visualized antibody binding using an enhanced chemiluminescence system 
(Pierce). We scanned specific bands and quantified them by densitometry.
Immunhistochemistry. We fixed animal tissues in 5% formalin and embed￾ded them in paraffin. We performed all staining using the Avidin/Biotin 
Blocking Kit (Vector Laboratories) and HRP Super Staining Kit (ID Labs) 
according to manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, we deparaffinized slides 
and boiled them twice for about 5 minutes at 600 W in a microwave in 
0.1 M citrate buffer (pH 6.0). We cooled down the slides to room tempera￾ture and incubated them in 3% H2O2 for 10 minutes. We then blocked the 
slides with the Avidin/Biotin Blocking Kit (Vector Laboratories) accord￾ing to manufacturer’s protocol and with SuperBlock for about 7 minutes. 
After washing 3 times with PBS, we incubated slides with anti-CD68 (Sero￾tec) diluted 1:1,000 in 1% BSA for about 1 hour, followed by incubation 
with the polyvalent antibody and HRP for 10 minutes. We washed the 
slides 3 times with PBS between every step. We detected specific staining 
using AEC Chromogen/Substrate (3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole; ID Labs). 
CD68-positive cells were counted throughout the whole diameter of a 
crosswise cut mouse ear at 500-fold amplification under the microscope. 
Starting from the same edge of the ear, we counted MPS cells in 10 con￾secutive sections and normalized MPS cell counts per field.
Whole-mount staining of lymph capillaries. We fixed ears in 4 % PFA over￾night at 4°C. We removed cartilage under the microscope and attached 
ears on Sylgaard plates with insect pins, washed with 0.3% PBS-TritonX 
(4 hours, at least 10 times), and blocked with Immunomix (0.2% BSA, 
5% goat serum in 0.3% PBS-TritonX) for 2 hours. We then incubated the 
samples with the primary antibody LYVE-1 (1:100 in Immunomix; Reli￾atech) overnight with shaking. They were washed in 0.3% PBS-TritonX 
for 6 hours (at least 5 times). Afterward we incubated samples with the 
secondary antibody (anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor A488; 1:500 in 0.3% PBS￾TritonX) overnight at room temperature with shaking, and we washed 
samples for 6 hours (at least 5 times) after that. We performed post fixing 
by incubating samples in 4% PFA for 10 minutes at room temperature. 
After washing 5 times with PBS for 30 minutes at room temperature, 
the ears were mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). They were 
analyzed with fluorescent microscopy. Quantification of fluorescence 
was performed using Image J.
GAG disaccharide analysis. We cut approximately 0.2 g of abdominal skin 
from mice into small slices and digested with 7.0 mg proteinase K in 5 ml 
20 mM Tris-buffer (pH 7.0) at 55°C for 16 hours (then boiled for 5 min￾utes). After centrifugation, we added 50 ml acetone to the supernatant and 
stored the tubes at –20°C for 16 hours. After precipitation, the tubes were 
centrifuged at 1,500 g for 5 minutes, and the precipitate was dried at 90°C 
overnight. We dissolved the dried material in 10 ml distilled water and 
introduced it into glass columns containing 9 ml of the anion-exchange 
resin (DEAE, Sigma-Aldrich). After washing the resin twice with 10 ml 
100 mM NaCl, pH 4, we eluted the GAGs with 15 ml 2.5 M NaCl, pH 4, and 
transferred the eluate to centrifugation tubes and again precipitated with 
150 ml acetone at –20°C for 16 hours. After precipitation, the tubes were 
centrifuged at 1,500 g for 5 minutes, and the precipitate was dried further 
at 90°C for 16 hours. We dissolved the dried material with the purified 
GAGs in 10 ml water, transferred it to a dialysis bag, and dialyzed it against 
distilled water for 24 hours. After lyophilization, we dissolved the purified 
skin GAGs in 0.5 ml deionized water for HPLC analysis.
HPLC disaccharide analysis. We treated 10 μl of samples with 5 mU chon￾droitin ABC lyase in 50 μl 100 mM Tris/150 mM sodium acetate buffer, 
pH 8.0, at 37°C for 16 hours. Boiling the solution for 1 minute blocked the 
reaction. We analyzed the unsaturated disaccharides generated from hyal￾uronan (ΔdiHA) and dermatan/chondroitin sulphate (Δdi4s and Δdi6s) 
after enzymatic treatment of the purified GAGs by strong anion exchange 
HPLC (column: Sphere-Image 80-5 SAX, Knauer) separation and detected 
at 232 nm. Isocratic separation was from 0 to 15 minutes with 10 mM 
NaHPO, pH 4.0, and linear gradient separation was from 15 to 35 minutes 
with 10 mM NaH2PO, pH 4.0, to 33% 750 mM NaH2PO, pH 4.0. Flow rate 
was 1.2 ml/min. HPLC equipment was from Shimadzu.
Statistics. Comparison of means of data from animal experiments with 
more than one effector (salt and genotype; salt and mF4-31c1 treatment) 
was calculated by multivariate or univariate analysis using the general lin￾ear measurements procedure. We tested for the effect of diet, genotype, 
and mF4-31c1 treatment. Differences between plasma and interstitial 
electrolyte concentrations and osmolality were investigated by paired t test 
(dependent samples) or 1-way ANOVA (independent samples). All data in 
the manuscript are presented as average ± SD. The terms “increased” or 
“decreased” are used only if the results were significant at P < 0.05. Statisti￾cal analysis was performed with SPSS software (version 15.0).
Study approval. We performed all animal experiments in accordance with 
the guidelines of the American Physiological Society, and the animal care 
and use committee of local government authorities approved the studies 
(Regierung von Mittelfranken, Ansbach, Germany).
