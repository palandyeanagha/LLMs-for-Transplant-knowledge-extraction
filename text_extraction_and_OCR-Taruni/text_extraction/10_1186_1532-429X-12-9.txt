Abstract
Background: The beating heart is the generator of blood flow through the cardiovascular system. Within the
heart’s own chambers, normal complex blood flow patterns can be disturbed by diseases. Methods for the
quantification of intra-cardiac blood flow, with its 4D (3D+time) nature, are lacking. We sought to develop and
validate a novel semi-automatic analysis approach that integrates flow and morphological data.
Method: In six healthy subjects and three patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, three-directional, three￾dimensional cine phase-contrast cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) velocity data and balanced steady-state
free-precession long- and short-axis images were acquired. The LV endocardium was segmented from the short￾axis images at the times of isovolumetric contraction (IVC) and isovolumetric relaxation (IVR). At the time of IVC,
pathlines were emitted from the IVC LV blood volume and traced forwards and backwards in time until IVR, thus
including the entire cardiac cycle. The IVR volume was used to determine if and where the pathlines left the LV.
This information was used to automatically separate the pathlines into four different components of flow: Direct
Flow, Retained Inflow, Delayed Ejection Flow and Residual Volume. Blood volumes were calculated for every
component by multiplying the number of pathlines with the blood volume represented by each pathline. The
accuracy and inter- and intra-observer reproducibility of the approach were evaluated by analyzing volumes of LV
inflow and outflow, the four flow components, and the end-diastolic volume.
Results: The volume and distribution of the LV flow components were determined in all subjects. The calculated
LV outflow volumes [ml] (67 ± 13) appeared to fall in between those obtained by through-plane phase-contrast
CMR (77 ± 16) and Doppler ultrasound (58 ± 10), respectively. Calculated volumes of LV inflow (68 ± 11) and
outflow (67 ± 13) were well matched (NS). Low inter- and intra-observer variability for the assessment of the
volumes of the flow components was obtained.
Conclusions: This semi-automatic analysis approach for the quantification of 4D blood flow resulted in accurate LV
inflow and outflow volumes and a high reproducibility for the assessment of LV flow components.
Introduction
The final product of the molecular, electrical and
mechanical events in the normal heart is the generation
of blood flow. The forces which result from interaction
between the heart and the flowing blood stimulate a
continuous remodeling process [1], interactively creating
an optimal geometry for efficient flow. Alterations in
left ventricular (LV) flow patterns have been recognized
in various cardiac diseases such as LV wall motion dis￾orders, valvular disease and arrhythmia. In heart failure,
the LV may undergo progressive adverse remodeling [2].
In these hearts, abnormal LV blood flow patterns have
been observed [3-5]. These altered flow patterns may be
detrimental to LV function, and in a vicious cycle, con￾tribute further to the adverse remodeling. Thus, it is
desirable to gain a deeper understanding of the LV
blood flow behavior under normal and disordered
conditions.
Previous methods have provided information about
some aspects of LV blood flow behavior. These methods
have been limited in their ability to assess the time-vary￾ing and intrinsically three-dimensional (time + 3D = 4D)
flow patterns within the beating LV. Limitations have
arisen due to velocity being recorded from single

directional velocity components (as with Doppler ultra￾sound) [6] or from two-dimensional (2D) regions of
interest with cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR)
[7,8]. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) of the heart
is being used more frequently [9-12] and has the poten￾tial to provide relevant information in the future. CFD
may produce data with higher spatial and temporal reso￾lution than actual in vivo data and creates the opportu￾nity to broadly examine different measures of flow and
the impact of varying conditions. However, today, the
complex blood flow patterns in the heart are difficult to
simulate accurately. Three-dimensional cine phase-con￾trast CMR (3D cine PC-CMR) has the ability to provide
measurements of a time-varying velocity field, which
allows for streamline [13] and pathline visualization
[14-17] of the blood flow patterns over a complete car￾diac cycle. This method has been applied most fre￾quently to the aorta [18-20], but a few studies have also
been performed in the beating heart [21,22].
Recently, we have developed CMR based tools that
elucidate 4D LV blood flow patterns [22]. This techni￾que enables the quantification of the volume, distribu￾tion and kinetic energy change of separate LV flow
components over the cardiac cycle. In order to reduce
user-dependency and enhance the reproducibility of this
technique, we sought to develop and validate a semi￾automatic analysis approach that better integrates flow
and morphological data.
Method
Measurements
Nine subjects were included in the study, mean age 54
years (range 22-62); six healthy subjects (three females),
mean age 58 (range 50-61) years, and three patients
(one female) suffering from idiopathic dilated cardio￾myopathy (DCM), mean age 46 (range 22-62) years
(Table 1). The healthy subjects had normal electrocar￾diograms and echocardiographic examinations without
valvular or ventricular dysfunction. No patient had more
than trace valvular insufficiency or stenosis. The study
was approved by the regional Ethical Review Board in
Linköping, Sweden. All nine subjects gave written
informed consent before participation.
In all nine subjects, 3D cine PC-CMR velocity data of
the left heart, morphological long- and short-axis data
of the LV, and 2D cine through-plane PC-CMR velocity
data of the ascending aorta were acquired on a clinical
1.5 T scanner (Philips Achieva, Philips Medical Systems,
Best, the Netherlands). Echocardiography was performed
using a Vivid 7 scanner and a 2.0 MHz probe (GE,
Vingmed Ultrasound, Horten, Norway).
Cine balanced steady-state free-precession (bSSFP)
imaging was used to acquire 2-, 3- and 4-chamber long￾axis and a stack of short-axis morphological images in
30 time frames during end-expiratory breath holds. A
slice thickness of 8 mm was used. Acquired pixel size
was 2.19 × 1.78 mm2 and 1.67 × 1.78 mm2 for the
short- and long-axis images, respectively. Reconstructed
pixel size was of 1.252 mm2 for the long-axis images
and 1.372 mm2 for the short-axis images.
Two-dimensional cine through-plane PC-CMR velo￾city data were acquired in a plane perpendicular to the
main flow direction in the ascending aorta (AoA) just
downstream from the aortic valve (AoV). Imaging para￾meters included a velocity encoding range (VENC) of
200 cm/s, an echo time (TE) of 3 ms, a repetition time
(TR) of 5 ms, a flip angle of 15°, a slice thickness of 7
mm, and a pixel size of 1.6 × 1.6 mm2
. Three lines of k￾space were acquired per heart beat, resulting in a tem￾poral resolution of 30 ms.
The three-directional, 3D cine PC-CMR velocity data
were acquired during free-breathing, using a navigator￾gated gradient-echo pulse-sequence with interleaved
three-directional flow-encoding and retrospective, vector
cardiogram controlled cardiac gating [23]. Common
acquisition parameters included a VENC of 100 cm/s, a
flip angle of 8°, a TE of 3.7 ms, and a TR of 6.3 ms. Par￾allel imaging by sensitivity encoding (SENSE) with a
speed-up factor of 2 was applied. To further reduce the
scan time, two k-space lines per flow encoding segment
were acquired during each heart beat. The spatial reso￾lution was 3 × 3 × 3 mm3
. The field-of-view (FOV) was
adjusted for each subject to fully encompass the left
heart. Scan time was about 10-15 minutes, excluding
the navigator gating efficiency. A temporal sliding-win￾dow reconstruction with individual non-linear stretching
of each RR-interval (Philips Medical Systems, Best, The
Netherlands) was used to reconstruct the time-resolved
PC-CMR data into 40 time frames. Data were corrected
for concomitant gradient field effects on the scanner. By
the use of automated in-house postprocessing software
written in Matlab (The MathWorks Inc., Natick, Massa￾chusetts, USA), the velocity data were corrected for
background errors and phase wraps and converted into

a file format compatible with commercially available
visualization software (EnSight, CEI Inc, Research Trian￾gle Park, NC, USA). The background correction scheme,
which was performed for each time frame, consisted of a
4th-order weighted least-squares fit to the static tissue of
the measured velocity data, where the weighting func￾tion was obtained from a combination of the signal
magnitude and the standard deviation of the measured
velocity over time [24].
After postprocessing, all 3D cine PC-CMR datasets
underwent quality control, which consisted of visual
inspection of pathlines emitted from a plane located
approximately at the mitral valve (MV) annulus and inte￾grated over one cardiac cycle. In addition to being valuable
for visualization and quantification, pathlines provide a
means of performing internal control of the data quality.
As pathlines are calculated by the integration of the time￾resolved velocity field, a pathline should never leave the
blood pool. Although in some cases a few pathlines may
leave the blood pool due to noise, it is important to make
sure that there are no systematic velocity offsets in the
data: such an offset may result in a set of aberrant path￾lines leaving the blood pool at a specific site. With our
present data acquisition and postprocessing protocol, the
vast majority of our data sets pass this quality control.
Data analysis
The method proposed for the quantification of LV flow
components consists of three steps:
1) Definition of geometrical constraints of the LV at
the times of isovolumetric contraction (IVC) and
isovolumetric relaxation (IVR).
2) Computation of pathlines, backwards and for￾wards in time, from the entire LV at the time of
IVC.
3) Separation of the pathlines into different compo￾nents using the IVR LV constraint.
The manual steps of this approach are the definition
of geometrical constraints and the determination of the
time of IVC and IVR in the 3D cine PC-CMR data.
Pathlines calculation and separation of the pathlines
into different components are fully automatic.
Following a pre-established protocol, the LV was seg￾mented from the stack of short-axis images, to define
geometrical constraints. The endocardial border was
defined according to the limit of the compact myocar￾dium, such that LV trabeculations were included in the
estimated LV blood volume. The IVC and IVR phases
were determined by visual inspection of the open or
closed positions of the aortic and mitral valves and the
LV size in the long- and short-axis images. The
segmentation was performed at IVC and IVR using
freely available segmentation software (Segment, version
1.699d) [25]. From the segmentations two binary masks
were created, each consisting of a stack of 8 mm thick
slices. These were used to create two masks of the LV
volume that matched the orientation of the 3D cine PC￾CMR data. The IVC LV volume was resampled to
match the 3D cine PC-CMR data resolution, using in￾house developed Matlab software and was considered to
contain all the blood residing in the LV during the ana￾lyzed cardiac cycle.
Pathlines were emitted from the resampled IVC LV
volume at the time of IVC, estimated from the 3D cine
PC-CMR data. In this method, the visual inspection of
short streamlines emitted from a three-chamber plane
was used to determine IVC and IVR as the time when
no flow can be seen across either the mitral or aortic
valve. The pathlines were emitted from the center point
of each voxel in the IVC LV volume and traced both
forward and backward in time until the time of IVR,
thus covering the complete cardiac cycle. No mask was
used in the pathline computation; the pathlines were
allowed to go anywhere in the 3D cine PC-CMR dataset
covering the whole heart. The computation of pathlines
was performed in EnSight (version 8.2), which utilizes a
4th order Runge-Kutta numerical integration technique
with adaptive step length.
The pathlines, describing all the blood transiting the
LV over a cardiac cycle, were analyzed using an auto￾matic algorithm, which works as follows. The IVR LV
volume was used to determine whether and where the
pathlines left the LV. A pathline leaving the IVR LV
volume through the basal plane was considered to have
left the LV in the physiological way, i.e. through the
AoV during systole (forward pathlines) or MV during
diastole (backward pathlines). Pathlines remaining below
the basal plane at the time for IVR were divided in two
categories: pathlines remaining inside the confines of
the IVR LV volume were considered to represent the
LV blood, whereas pathlines extending outside of this
volume were considered to either have been emitted
from the myocardium or to have left the LV due to data
imperfections, such as noise or uncompensated back￾ground phase errors. The second category of pathlines
was excluded from further calculations.
Based on this combination of pathlines and geometri￾cal constraints, the intraventricular blood flow was auto￾matically divided into the four components, as defined
by Bolger et al [22]:
• Direct Flow: Blood that enters the LV during dia￾stole and leaves the LV during systole in the ana￾lyzed heart beat
Eriksson et al. Journal of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance 2010, 12:9
http://www.jcmr-online.com/content/12/1/9
Page 3 of 10

• Retained Inflow: Blood that enters the LV during
diastole but does not leave during systole in the ana￾lyzed heart beat
• Delayed Ejection Flow: Blood that starts and
resides inside the LV during diastole and leaves dur￾ing systole
• Residual Volume: Blood that resides within the LV
for at least two cardiac cycles
Each of these pathlines was considered to represent a
volume of blood defined by the emitter density, here
chosen to correspond to the voxel size of the 3D cine
PC-CMR data. The volumes of the different components
were calculated by multiplying the number of pathlines
in each component group with the voxel volume.
Evaluation and statistical analysis
The analysis approach proposed was evaluated for accu￾racy as well as inter- and intra-observer variability on
nine subjects. Accuracy was evaluated by comparing the
LV inflow and outflow, where Inflow = Direct Flow +
Retained Inflow and Outflow = Direct Flow + Delayed
Ejection Flow. In addition, the outflow obtained by the
proposed approach was related to measurements
obtained by 2D cine through-plane PC-CMR and Dop￾pler ultrasound, respectively.
Two investigators, referred to as Investigator 1 (Inv 1)
and Investigator 2 (Inv 2), participated in the inter￾observer study and carried out the analysis of all nine
subjects independently of each other. Inv 1 had little
experience and Inv 2 had moderate experience in seg￾menting the LV from short axis CMR images. To assess
the intra-observer variability, Inv 1 repeated the analysis
on all nine data sets approximately one month after the
first analysis. The results from the first analysis of Inv 1
are referred to as Analysis 1 (A1) and the second as
Analysis 2 (A2).
All values are given as group mean ± 1SD unless
otherwise specified. In the statistical analyses, all nine
subjects are considered as one group. For LV inflow ver￾sus outflow comparison, two-tailed paired t-tests were
used, and the statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.
In the observer variability studies, two-tailed paired t￾tests were used to test for differences between the two
investigators, or between Inv 1 A1 and Inv 1 A2. As five
interrelated parameters were compared, a Bonferroni
correction was performed, and the level of significance
was adjusted to P < 0.01.
Results
All nine datasets were acquired successfully. No signifi￾cant aberrant traces, indicating artifacts or insufficient
correction for background offset, were observed in any
of the datasets.
The flow data from each of the nine subjects (Table 1)
were analyzed twice by Inv 1 and once by Inv 2, using
the proposed approach, resulting in pathline visualiza￾tion of the four LV flow components, as demonstrated
in Figures 1 and 2 and Additional file 1.
The relative size of the four flow components of intra￾ventricular flow in the six healthy subjects is shown in
Figure 3. The two largest components were Direct Flow
and Residual Volume.
The LV outflow, computed from 3D cine PC-CMR
obtained by Inv1 A1, was related to LV outflow quanti￾fied using 2D cine through-plane PC-CMR and Doppler
ultrasound, respectively, for all nine subjects (Table 2).
Outflow estimates obtained from 2D cine through-plane
PC-CMR appeared to be larger, while outflow estimates
from Doppler Ultrasound appeared to be smaller.
As a test of the accuracy of the method proposed, the
LV inflow and outflow volumes were compared. No sig￾nificant difference between inflow and outflow volume
was found in any of the three analyses (Table 3).
The inter- and intra-observer variability was analyzed
for the EDV and the four intra-ventricular flow compo￾nents (Figure 4). As shown in Table 4 no significant dif￾ferences were found for any of the parameters
investigated. The end-diastolic volume comparison
between Inv 1 A2 and Inv 2 resulted in borderline
significance.
Discussion
In the present study, a novel analysis approach for 4D
intra-ventricular flow data was developed and validated.
The proposed analysis approach: (1) allowed quantifica￾tion of the volume, distribution and timing of separate
components of LV flow in all nine data sets; (2)
obtained a measurement of the LV outflow volume that
appeared to be in between the magnitudes obtained by
2D cine through-plane PC-CMR and Doppler ultra￾sound, respectively; (3) achieved equal magnitudes of
the LV inflow and outflow volumes; and (4) showed a
high intra- and inter-observer reproducibility for the
assessment of the volumes of the LV flow components.
In addition, the present analysis approach was both less
user-dependent and time-consuming than our previous
technique: using the present approach the time required
for each analysis was reduced from hours per analysis to
minutes. In fact, the only user interaction necessary is
the segmentation of the LV from short axis morphologi￾cal images and to determine the times of IVC and IVR
in the 3D cine PC-CMR data.
The proposed approach enables the quantification and
extended visualization (Additional file 1) of the flow￾derived LVEDV separated into the four intra-ventricular
flow components (Direct Flow, Retained Inflow, Delayed
Ejection Flow and Residual Volume). The visualization is

extended because this approach facilitates the visualiza￾tion of the residual volume and the other flow compo￾nents over one cardiac cycle. When comparing the
present measurements of these flow components with
our previous findings [22], some differences were
observed, such as a higher amount of the Direct Flow
and Residual Volume using the present approach. We
believe that these differences may be explained by a
number of factors. The present velocity data have higher
spatial and temporal resolution, and the previous data
were acquired without respiratory compensation. The
continuous emission of pathlines over diastolic filling
might lead to an underestimation of inflow using our
previous technique. The previous technique approxi￾mated the EDV by making a wire frame hull of the par￾ticle trace positions at end diastole; this likely caused an
underestimation of the true EDV. The Residual Volume
as estimated by the previous method used this inaccu￾rate EDV; the volume was not directly visualized using
pathlines. In contrast, the present analysis approach
allows tracing of the Residual Volume as well as the
other flow components. There is a risk of overestimating
this component in the presented approach, since the
limit of the LV cavity is defined as the compact myocar￾dium. It is possible that some of the IVC traces are
emitted from the trabeculae but are included in the IVR
blood volume. However, in both the previous and pre￾sent analysis approach, this would constitute a consis￾tent error as it is done in the same way in every data
set.
The LV outflow volume measured with the proposed
approach correlated with measurements obtained with
both 2D cine through-plane PC-CMR and Doppler
ultrasound (Table 2). The flow-based volume appeared
to fall in between the volumes obtained from the two
other methods. LV stroke volumes obtained by ultra￾sound are generally smaller than those obtained by
CMR. Stalder et al [26] compared 3D cine PC-CMR and
2D cine PC-CMR and found that 3D cine PC-CMR
gave slightly lower velocities. This is most likely due to
lower spatial resolution in the 3D cine PC-CMR data.
Although the stroke volume and end-diastolic volume
can be measured using the proposed analysis, we do not
suggest that it should replace 2D cine through-plane

PC-CMR or ultrasound techniques for the assessment of
these parameters. The strength of the method proposed
is instead that each part of the LV blood volume is
monitored throughout the cardiac cycle, enabling assess￾ment of the dynamic and multidimensional blood flow
organization within the beating LV.
We validated the accuracy of this approach by com￾paring LV inflow and outflow volumes in each subject.
We have not validated all different components and the
blood flow patterns in the LV. However, LV inflow con￾sists of Direct Flow and Retained Inflow, the LV outflow
consists of Direct Flow and Delayed Ejection Flow. The
Residual Volume is not validated, but it is based on the
same flow data and segmentation of the LV. The
segmentation of the LV from short axis morphological
images is well validated [27,28] and often part of the
clinical CMR protocol. Visualization of blood flow using
pathlines has been used extensively before [15,16,18-22].
The accuracy of the computed pathlines depends, how￾ever, on a large number of factors, including temporal
and spatial resolution, VENC, field strength, CMR hard￾ware, and intravoxel dephasing due to turbulence. We
recommend therefore performing the validation based
on inflow vs outflow for every patient study using this
analysis approach, as it is easy to perform without any
extra acquisitions or analysis.

components (Table 4 and Figure 4). No significant dif￾ferences between observers were detected; the difference
in EDV obtained by Inv1 A2 and Inv 2 were of border￾line significance. We believe that, of all the steps of the
analysis, the LV segmentation has the most important
impact on the reproducibility of the results. This is
especially true for the selection of the most basal short
axis slice in the LV, as this plane is used to determine
whether the traces leave the LV in the basal-apical
direction. We choose this plane in order to avoid the
inclusion of the LA volume into the LV segmentation,
and in most cases its position was easy to identify. In
terms of other regions of the LV, an overestimation of
the ventricular volume will most likely give an overesti￾mation of the Residual Volume, while an underestima￾tion may remove important portions of the flowing
blood. In our segmentation protocol we chose to seg￾ment compact myocardium. We preferred a clinically
useful segmentation approach that minimizes the risk of
missing important flow due to partial volume effects; as
the slice thickness was 8 mm it is very likely that the
structure of the endocardial border varies through the
plane, and that the pixel value is an average value of the
tissue in the pixel. There is no consensus in the litera￾ture regarding the impact of including trabeculae and
papillary muscles in the ventricular volume. Papavassiliu
et al [27] concluded that even though the trabeculae sig￾nificantly influence the LV volume, the superior repro￾ducibility of their inclusion in the LV volume makes
this approach most appropriate for clinical use. Sievers
et al [28] concluded that, although there are systematic
differences between inclusion and exclusion of trabecu￾lae and papillary muscles, these differences are small
and do not necessarily have a clinical relevance in
healthy or diseased hearts and that inclusion is signifi￾cantly faster. Also in the 3D cine PC-CMR data, voxels
partially covered by trabeculae will suffer from partial
volume effects, leading to an underestimation of the
velocity of the flowing blood in these voxels. Another
factor interactively set by the investigator is timing, but
this factor is less critical than the LV segmentation pro￾cedure as long as particles are emitted at a time frame
when no flow is crossing the mitral or aortic valve.
3D cine PC-CMR flow data comprise large amounts of
information and the ability to quantify important aspects
of these data with a user-friendly and accurate tool
opens the door to larger studies which could address

unanswered physiological and clinical questions. In addi￾tion to the assessment of the volume and distribution of
the different LV flow components, the proposed analysis
approach also allows quantification of the kinetic energy
change of these components throughout the cardiac
cycle. Recent findings in normal hearts suggest that the
Direct Flow best preserves its kinetic energy during tran￾sit through the LV, while the Retained Inflow decelerates
and requires greater addition of energy to achieve even￾tual ejection from the chamber [22]. In dilated and
hypocontractile hearts, preliminary findings have shown
that the normal organization of LV flow is altered, and
that this abnormal flow pattern affects pumping effi￾ciency. The decreased direct flow and increased residual
volume seen in these patients may be disadvantageous
from an LV pumping efficiency point of view [22]. The
ability to measure ventricular performance using multi￾dimensional blood flow analysis creates the potential for
new perspectives on pathophysiology, early diagnosis,
treatment options, and prognosis.

Limitations
Although no significant differences between the LV
inflow and outflow were detected for any of the three
analyzes, in a few subjects larger differences were
observed. Careful review of these cases suggested that
the morphological and flow data did not match exactly,
so that the morphological data were displaced relative to
the flow data. The reason for this was likely the result of
subject motion between the acquisition of the 3D cine
PC-CMR and the bSSFP data. This error could be mini￾mized by careful instruction of the patient not to move
between the scans. A more extensive approach may be
to use volume registration. This will be further investi￾gated in future studies.
Aortic or mitral valve insufficiency is at present a lim￾itation because the regurgitant pathlines will be inaccu￾rately included in the volume of the components that
leave the LV. However, regurgitant flow pathlines will
be identifiable using the timing and location where they
leave the segmented volume. Detection and correction
for these regurgitant pathlines will be implemented and
evaluated for studies including patients with valve insuf￾ficiency. In the present study, valvular regurgitation that
was more than trace constituted an exclusion criterion.
Conclusions
A semi-automatic analysis approach for the quantifica￾tion and visualization of 4D LV flow data was developed
and validated in normal and dilated, myopathic hearts.
The presented technique, utilizing the integration of
morphological data and 3D cine PC-CMR flow data,
allows for quantification of the volume, distribution and
timing of separate components of LV flow and extends
visualization of LV flow. The analysis approach was
shown to yield accurate LV inflow and outflow volumes,
and a high intra- and inter-observer reproducibility for
the assessment of the flow components, which may
open the door to larger clinical studies.
