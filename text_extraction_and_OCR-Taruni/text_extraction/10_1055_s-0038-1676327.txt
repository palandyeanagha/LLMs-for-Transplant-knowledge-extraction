Interventional radiologists perform a variety of image-guided
procedures utilizing a variety of tools to create minimally
invasive access into the biliary, gastrointestinal, and genitour￾inary systems, as well as other structures. Endoscopy has been
utilized by other specialists, namely gastroenterology and
urology, to treat similar pathologies, but interventional radi￾ology-operated endoscopy has only been implemented at a
few academic centers to date.
The learning curve for an interventional radiologist to
become proficient at endoscopic interventions is tempered
by the technical dexterity and hand–eye coordination
already required for other image-guided procedures. More￾over, the relative safety of endoscopy evidenced by the
routine performance of laryngoscopy, bronchoscopy, eso￾phagogastroduodenoscopy, colonoscopy, and cystoscopy at
the bedside or in outpatient clinics supports its implementa￾tion by interventional radiologists.
This article discusses the application of interventional
radiology-operated endoscopy in the biliary, gastrointest￾inal, and genitourinary systems (►Fig. 1).
Preparation and Equipment
Procedural Preparation
Procedures may be performed using moderate sedation with
intravenousmidazolam and fentanyl, although general anesthe￾sia is favored. Periprocedural antibiotics are administered
according to the Society of Interventional Radiology guidelines.
Orogastric and rectal tubes may be placed in patients during
procedures expected to be longer than 1 hour to control fluid
loads and help maintain body temperatures. Body warmers are
also used in all patients to maintain core temperatures.
Preprocedural discussion with the referring medical or
surgical subspecialties should be performed to ensure all
clinicians are in agreement regarding the planned procedure.
Initial access into the area of interest is gained using standard
techniques for cholangiography, cholecystostomy, gastro￾stomy, or nephrostomy. Percutaneous access into the area of
interest may be obtained in the same session as endoscopy. A
mature tract, however, may decrease leakage and pain, espe￾cially when using larger endoscopes. Laboratory evaluation
with particular attention to coagulation parameters should be
performed, especially if same-day endoscopy is being consid￾ered. International normalized ratio greater than 1.5 and
platelet count less than 50,000/µL are relative contraindica￾tions to percutaneous access procedures.
Endoscopes
Endoscopy may be performed with a 7-Fr flexible reusable 9.5-
Fr flexible disposable, 9-Fr flexible reusable, 16.5-Fr flexible
reusable (Olympus America), or 22.5-Fr rigid reusable endo￾scope (Olympus America), depending on the indication, access
route, operator preference, and the availability of the endo￾scope. ►Fig. 2 demonstrates the types of endoscopes.
The endoscopes are connected to a large continuous saline
flush bag system with a UroLok adapter and three-way
stopcock. Light sources and suction devices are connected
to the endoscopes.
Prior to endoscopy, a steel reinforced support wire is
placed, followed by a second steel reinforced support wire
that serves as a safety wire. For larger endoscopes, namely
the 22.5-Fr rigid reusable endoscope, the tract is dilated
using a high-pressure 8-mm  15-cm X-Force balloon. Once
the tract is dilated, a sheath is placed over one of the

guidewires. A peel-away sheath is typically used to allow for
external drainage of excess fluid during endoscopy. The
appropriate sheath size varies according to the endoscope,
and should be large enough to accommodate both the
endoscope and at least one wire while allowing for easy
removal of the endoscope (►Table 1). Devices for stone
fragmentation or foreign body removal may be inserted
through the endoscope’s working channel (►Table 1).
Interventional Radiology-Operated Biliary
Endoscopy
Indications
The most common indication for biliary endoscopy is stone
disease within the biliary system.1,2 Gallbladder stones affect
1.4% of the general population annually with progression to
symptomatic disease in 1 to 4%.1,2 The efficacy of cholecystost￾omy tubes is well established in high-risk surgical patients, but
such patients may require life-long percutaneous drainage
unless endoscopic stone extraction is performed.3,4 Endoscopic
treatment for biliary colic or obstruction usually begins with
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Failure of
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, such as in
the setting of altered bowel or biliary anatomy, obstructing
mass, or benign strictures, may necessitate percutaneous trans￾hepatic cholangiography with biliary drainage. Bariatric
patients who have undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, for
instance, are at high risk for developing biliary calculi and colic.5
Additionally, benign hepaticojejunostomy strictures may occur
in up to 12.5% of anastomoses.6 In these situations, endoscopic
retrograde cholangiopancreatography is often not feasible sec￾ondary to the postsurgical anatomy rendering percutaneous
biliary drainage necessary.5 In liver transplant recipients, up to
18% of patients develop biliary cast syndrome, and often require
biliary drainage due to peripheral duct involvement (Figs. 3–5).7
Considerations
When performing interventional radiology-operated chole￾cystoscopy (gallbladder endoscopy) and cholecystolitho￾tripsy, the ideal approach is along the long axis of the
gallbladder from the fundus to the cystic duct which may
be achieved by either transhepatic or transperitoneal access.
This allows for thorough examination of the gallbladder and
in-line extraction or antegrade sweeping of fragmented
calculi through the cystic duct. Initial 7- to 10-Fr access
catheters are placed with staged upsizing of the tract to 12-
to 24-Fr for cholecystoscopy. Single-session cholecystostomy
access and cholecystoscopy may be performed in some
patients, although this is generally less optimal due to the
potential risk of intraperitoneal leakage without tract
maturity.
General anesthesia may be needed for patient comfort,
given procedure times commonly exceed 2 hours. Addition￾ally, significant intraprocedural pain may occur with balloon
dilatation of biliary ducts as well as transhepatic and trans￾peritoneal tracts. The anesthesiologist should be aware that
the procedure will involve the use of high-flow and high￾volume irrigation into the biliary and gastrointestinal system
which may cause electrolyte disturbances and fluctuations
in body temperature. As such, cranial draping may prevent
additional heat loss by the patient. A commercial available
drainage system may be utilized to decrease spillage of fluid
onto the floor minimizing hazard for interventional radiol￾ogy staff. Orogastric and rectal tubes may be placed for
containment of gastrointestinal output and monitoring of
patient fluid and electrolyte status.
Techniques
Following preprocedural preparation, cholecystostomy
tubes are first removed over a guidewire, a steel reinforced
support wire is placed as a safety wire into the gallbladder.

Over a second stiff wire, the tract is dilated with a high￾pressure 8 mm  15 cm X-Force balloon, to facilitate place￾ment of the 22.5-Fr rigid endoscope. Electrohydraulic, laser,
and ultrasonic lithotripsy devices may be used to fragment
stones that are too large to be extracted through the endo￾scope introducer or pushed through the cystic duct. Mechan￾ical Zero Tip nitinol stone retrieval baskets may be used to
retrieve or sweep obstructing stones or debris. The Arrow￾Trerotola thrombectomy device may also be used to liquefy
thick debris to allow for easier sweeping of stones into the
cystic duct. Repeat cholecystogram and endoscopy should be
performed until adequate clearance of debris and stones is
achieved.
Upon completion of the procedure, a transcystic internal/
external drainage catheter as well as replacement of the
cholecystostomy drainage catheter should be performed.
Catheter size is dependent on operator preference and the
final tract size (e.g., a 10-Fr internal/external and 14-Fr
external drain for a 24-Fr tract). Patients are admitted over￾night for observation with a second dose of intravenous
antibiotics the following morning. Upon discharge, patients
are prescribed an oral antibiotic, amoxicillin/clavulanate 875
mg/125 mg, or other equivalent antibiotic, twice daily for 7 to
10 days. Some operators may choose to discharge patients
with ursodeoxycholic acid 300 mg twice daily to prevent
gallstone recurrence.
Reevaluation is performed in 2 weeks, with removal of the
internal/external drainage catheter if a patent’s cystic duct is
patent via sheath cholecystogram. Depending on the size of
the cholecystocutaneous tract, cholecystostomy tubes may
be removed or downsized appropriately with plan for even￾tual removal.
Reports of cholecystoscopy with cholecystolithotripsy
have been described with overall positive outcomes.8–10
Through staged procedures, the use of cholecystoscopy
increases the rate of complete calculus removal through
direct visualization, as compared to fluoroscopic-guided
percutaneous cholecystolithotripsy alone.11 Most patients
should be drain free within 2 to 4 weeks with a low rate of
recurrent disease.
Similar considerations apply to intrahepatic or extrahe￾patic biliary pathology. Once acute decompression is
achieved with biliary drainage and the active infection
resolved, 7- to 10-Fr drainage catheters are upsized through
the mature tract to 12- to 14-Fr drainage catheters following
4 to 6 weeks to allow for tract maturation.
The techniques for interventional radiology-operated
choledochoscopy (endoscopy of the biliary tree) and inter￾ventions in the biliary tree are similar to those described
earlier for cholecystoscopy. Depending on the suspected
location of the targeted lesion, both small bore and large
bore rigid and flexible endoscopes may be utilized. Chole￾dochoscopy may be performed for the treatment of biliary
sludge, choledocholithiasis, and biliary casts utilizing the
same devices listed in ►Table 1. Additionally, filling defects
or strictures shown by cholangiography may be further
characterized, biopsied, and treated under endoscopic
guidance.
Postprocedure management following choledochoscopy
also requires placement of internal/external percutaneous
biliary drainage catheters, overnight observation, repeat
intravenous antibiotic dosing the following morning, and 7
to 10 days of oral antibiotics. Reevaluation in 2 weeks is also
required to demonstrate adequate bilioenteric drainage via
sheath cholangiogram and removal or downsize of indwel￾ling drainage catheter if appropriate.
See ►Figs. 3 and4 for examples of interventional radiology￾operated cholecystoscopy and choledochoscopy.
Interventional Radiology-Operated
Genitourinary Endoscopy
Indications
Percutaneous nephrostomy is the mainstay of treating acute
obstructing uropathy when a retrograde approach fails.
Antegrade percutaneous nephrolithotripsy has become a
mainstay of urologic practice providing definitive manage￾ment of obstructing calculi, but often requiring a multi￾disciplinary approach.12 Minimally invasive techniques of
ureteral balloon dilatation and nephroureteral stenting are
performed after stricture traversal. When fluoroscopic￾guided recanalization cannot be achieved, interventional
radiology-operated genitourinary endoscopy may lead to
success.13 Placement of an internal/external drainage cathe￾ter allows patients to drain internally, thereby improving
quality of life. This may facilitate eventual internalization,
with no residual external component. Interventional radi￾ology-operated ureteroscopy (endoscopy of the ureter) may
also be used to aid in foreign body retrieval including
retained instruments or stent fragments which may serve
as a nidus for infection. Though rare, migrated renal embo￾lization coils have also been retrieved.14–17 The removal of
migrated coils has a high risk of causing significant bleeding
and interventional radiologists may be prepared to treat
such complications with simultaneous prone transradial
arterial access.18
Considerations
Generally, percutaneous nephrostomy should be placed
through Brodel’s line to avoid vascular structures, but
interventional radiology-operated nephroscopy (endoscopy
of the kidney) or ureteroscopy for stone or foreign body
removal should have percutaneous access that is ideal for
the intervention. In patients with urinary obstruction and
ongoing urinary tract infection, appropriate drainage and
antibiotic course should be completed prior to any invasive
procedures including tract dilation and ureteroscopy. If no
active infection is present, percutaneous access, tract dila￾tion, and ureteroscopy may be performed in single session.
Techniques
After placement of a steel reinforced support wire securely
into the renal pelvis or proximal ureter, serial dilation is
performed to accommodate the appropriate sheath size
and corresponding endoscope (►Table 1). In general, the
22.5-Fr rigid endoscope may be utilized for upper tract

disease with more flexible and smaller caliber endoscopes
for distal disease. Rigid endoscopes may require dilation of
the tract using a high-pressure 8 to 10 mm  15 cm X￾Force balloon.
In cases of ureteral obstruction in which fluoroscopic
guidance alone has failed, flexible endoscopes provide direct
visualization to aid in crossing these strictures. They contain
working channels for guidewires and catheters to allow for
access into the distal collecting system. Conversion of per￾cutaneous nephrostomy drainage catheters to nephrouret￾eral stents and double J antegrade ureteral stents has been
described.13 In addition, when there is concern for recurrent
malignancies or strictures, endoscopic guidance may be
utilized for accurately directed biopsies. In these settings,
the smallest caliber endoscope to allow for the planned
intervention based on the size of the inner working channel
should be chosen to limit complications and leakage after the
procedure.
Interventional Radiology-Operated
Gastrointestinal Endoscopy
Indications
Percutaneous gastric access is routinely performed for vent￾ing or feeding. For upper gastrointestinal surveillance endo￾scopy in patients with altered surgical anatomy, a combined
approach by interventional radiology and gastroenterology
is feasible. Interventional radiology-operated gastrointest￾inal endoscopy, however, may be performed for single-ses￾sion upper gastrointestinal intervention. Interventional
radiology-operated gastrointestinal endoscopy may be
used for placement complex feeding tubes or for foreign
body retrieval including fragmented plastic or metallic stents
as well as eroded embolization coils. In the latter setting,
simultaneous arterial access to prepare for potential bleed￾ing complications may also be performed (►Figs. 5 and 6).
Similarly, interventional radiology-operated endoscopy of
the lower gastrointestinal tract for surveillance should be
performed by trained gastroenterologists. The combined use
of fluoroscopy and endoscopy, however, makes interventional
radiology-operated endoscopy optimal for lower gastrointest￾inal interventions. Complete or partial obstruction of the colon
may occur in up to 29% of patients with colorectal cancer.19
While the standard management of a significant malignant
bowel obstruction requires promptdecompression, an abdom￾inal operation for diverting ostomy in an unprepared colon
carries a high morbidity and mortality compared to elective
operations.20 Within the subset of inoperable patients with
malignant bowel obstruction, interventional radiology-oper￾ated gastrointestinal endoscopy may provide benefit. Patients
with benign strictures due to prior adhesions or radiation are
often considered poor surgical candidates. In these patients,
interventional radiologists are often consulted for venting
gastrostomy tubes. Further interventions, however, may be

utilized to treat the primary cause. Previous reports of fluoro￾scopic- and endoscopic-guided colonic dilatation and colonic
stenting have been described by interventional radiologists as
a bridge to operative management or simply as a palliative
procedure with success rates up to 92%.21,22
Considerations
In gastric or upper gastrointestinal interventions, percuta￾neous transperitoneal gastrostomy access is required. While
the traditional access for placement of a gastrostomy tube is
toward the pylorus, the access route may be altered to target
the area of interest. If there are plans to dilate the tract up to 24-
or 30-Fr, T-fasteners should be placed to ensure safe tract
dilation and maturation.
If percutaneous access, dilation, and intervention are all
performed in a single session, general anesthesia is recom￾mended, as the procedure may be prolonged and percuta￾neous tract dilation may cause significant intraprocedural
pain. In addition, high-flow and high-volume irrigation into
the gastrointestinal system may be utilized similar to biliary
interventions, and the anesthesiologist should be made
aware. Orogastric or nasogastric tubes allow for insufflation
and decompression as needed, and rectal tubes provide
containment of gastrointestinal output.
Techniques
Once percutaneous access into the stomach has been achieved
and secured with T-fasteners, a steel reinforced support wire
should be advanced into the proximal duodenum or coiled in
the stomach. A safety wire should also be placed in a similar
fashion. Depending on the indication, the tract may be dilated
using an appropriately sized high-pressure balloon over which
the corresponding sheath may be inserted.
Utilization of interventional radiology-operated gastro￾scopy (endoscopy of the stomach) enables direct visualiza￾tion of lesions, or radiolucent foreign bodies, with assistance
of injectable contrast media under fluoroscopy to detect
perforation and determine positioning. If a percutaneous
approach is performed, an appropriately sized gastrostomy
tube must remain in place for 6 weeks following the proce￾dure to allow for tract maturation, after which the tube may
be removed if no longer indicated.
Patients who have undergone incomplete colonoscopy
due to obstructions may be further evaluated by interven￾tional radiology-operated colonoscopy (endoscopy of the
colon) beyond the obstruction with possible biopsy or stent￾ing of the lesion. If the patient is obstructed and a palliative
operation is feasible, oral bowel preparation should be
avoided until the obstruction is relieved.

Endoscopic and fluoroscopic colonic interventions may be
performed under moderate intravenous sedation or general
anesthesia for prolonged procedures. Depending on the
distance of the segment of interest from the anus, a tradi￾tional colonoscope may be substituted with a flexible or rigid
endoscope. Around the endoscope or through the working
channel, a guidewire may be placed to traverse obstructions.
Once a stiff Lunderquist or Amplatz guidewire is secured
proximal to the obstruction, a long sheath may be used to
straighten tortuous colon and allow instrumentation and
endoscopy across the obstruction.
Specific considerations and techniques in regard to colo￾nic stenting have been described.21,22 In patients with
malignant obstruction, rates of restenosis due to tumor
ingrowth have been reported as high as 12%.23 Therefore,
in palliative patients, cecostomy tubes may be placed once a
definitive operation has been performed.
See ►Figs. 5 and 6 for examples of interventional radi￾ology-operated gastroscopy and colonoscopy.
Discussion
The feasibility and appropriateness for interventional radiol￾ogists to perform endoscopic procedures mentioned in this
review may be contested.24 As this review suggests, however,
interventional radiologists are in a position to implement
routine interventional radiology-operated endoscopy and
are poised to develop new and associated techniques. Just as
ultrasound and fluoroscopy have been utilized to facilitate
surgical and medical procedures, endoscopy should be an
adjunctive tool for interventional radiologists in the era of
image-guided therapy. Over the past several decades, general
surgery societies and training programs have promoted endo￾scopic training. Laparoscopic surgery has similarly become a
major component of both urologic and gynecologic training. As
other medical and surgical subspecialties have borrowed from
one another to improve their therapies, interventional radi￾ologists should be equally opportunistic with interventional
radiology-operated endoscopy.
Collaboration with other specialties is key in maintaining an
integrated approach to the comprehensive care of patients. Turf
wars have been a common topic since the advent of interven￾tional radiology. Interventional radiology-operated endoscopy
may be questioned by colleagues, but patient selection and
treatment coordination are key. Multidisciplinary approaches
with two or more subspecialties in the endoscopy, fluoroscopy,
or operating suite may be required. Implementation of inter￾ventional radiology-operated endoscopy will likely be
embraced by colleagues when used appropriately.
Because endoscopic procedures come with risk, interven￾tional radiologists must have admitting privileges and coor￾dinate with colleagues in case of complications. Such a
relationship already exists between gastroenterology and
surgery for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and colonos￾copies complicated by perforation. The modern interven￾tional radiologist must also know when to request help when
unforeseen complications arise which may require evalua￾tion and treatment by a different specialist.
Modern diagnostic and interventional radiology trainees
have no or little exposure to interventional radiology-oper￾ated endoscopy throughout their training. The process for
interested trainees is not well established in the United
States, though other countries have established guidelines
for obtaining endoscopy training, including the British
Society of Gastrointestinal and Abdominal Radiology.25 The
use of endoscopy in interventional radiology is a supple￾mental tool, with minimal setup and small learning curves.
Interventional radiology-operated endoscopy, however, has
the potential to revolutionize the care of patients with
pathology of the biliary (Figs. 3–5), genitourinary, and gas￾trointestinal (►Figs. 5 and 6) systems and beyond (►Fig. 7).
Conclusion
Endoscopy has advanced over the past decades. The
resources needed for endoscopy are minimal and interven￾tional radiologists are well poised to incorporate such ima￾ging modalities into their clinical practices. The indications,

considerations, and techniques discussed earlier are some of
the ways interventional radiology-operated endoscopy may
help provide better and more comprehensive care for select
patients. With appropriate patient selection, adequate
resources, and integration into modern training paradigms,
interventional radiology-operated endoscopy may prove to
be an invaluable tool to deliver exquisite patient care.
