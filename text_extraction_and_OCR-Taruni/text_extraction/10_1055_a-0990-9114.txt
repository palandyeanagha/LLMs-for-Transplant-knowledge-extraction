ABSTRACT
Background and study aims Preoperative biliary drain￾age of hilar cholangiocarcinoma (HC) is controversial. The
goal of this study was to compare the clinical outcome and
associated complications for types II, III, and IV HC mana￾ged by percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD)
and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
(ERCP).
Patients and methods Between January 2011 and June
2017, a total of 180 patients with II, III, and IV HC were en￾rolled in this retrospective cohort study. According to the
drainage method, patients were divided into two groups:
PTBD (n = 81) and ERCP (n = 99). This study was registered
with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03104582, and was completed.
Results Compared with the PTBD group, the ERCP group
had a higher incidence of post-procedural cholangitis (37
[37.37 %] vs. 18 [22.22 %], P = 0.028) and pancreatitis (17
[17.17 %] vs. 2 [2.47 %], P = 0.001); required more salvaged
biliary drainage (18 [18.18 %] vs. 5 [6.17 %], P = 0.029), and
incurred a higher cost (P < 0.05). Patients with type III and IV
HC in the ERCP group had more cholangitis than those in
the PTBD group (26 [36.62 %] vs. 11 [18.03 %], P = 0.018).
The rate of cholangitis in patients who received endoscopic
bilateral biliary stents insertion was higher than patients
with unilateral stenting (23 [50.00%] vs. 9 [26.47 %], P =
0.034), and underwent PTBD internal-external drainage
had a higher incidence of cholangitis than those with only
external drainage (11 [34.36 %] vs. 7 [14.29 %], P = 0.034).
No significant difference in the rate of cholangitis was
observed between the endoscopic unilateral stenting

Introduction
Hilar cholangiocarcinoma (HC, or Klatskin tumor) is considered
highly malignant due to its aggressive nature with early inva￾sion into the adjacent liver and thus a poor prognosis. It ac￾counts for 40 % to 60 % of all extrahepatic bile duct carcinomas
[1]. Currently, radical resection is still considered one of the
most effective treatments, especially for Bismuth-Corlette
type II, III, and IV lesions. Due to the slow-growing nature of
the tumor, most lesions are found in an advanced stage when
patients present with obstructive jaundice, involvement of the
segmental bile ducts, and invasion into the liver, which makes
complete resection difficult and, thus, radical resection rates
are low [2 – 5]. Tumor involvement of the liver hilum leads to ex￾tensive intrahepatic bile duct obstruction, resulting in damage
to the liver, nervous system, and cardiovascular and urinary sys￾tems. Tumor invasion could involve the cystic duct and exten￾sion to the intrahepatic bile ducts. Resection of the hilar tumor
with extended hepatectomy offers the best chance for cure. Al￾though HC can be diagnosed at an early stage, the current re￾ported R0 resection rate is less than 30 %, and a reported 5-
year postoperative survival rate ranges from 30 % to 40 % [6, 7].
Current consensus indicates that preoperative biliary drain￾age is beneficial to improve postoperative liver function [8].
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and
percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) are fre￾quently used to provide biliary drainage because both methods
are effective in relieving the obstructive jaundice. However,
these invasive procedures are associated with an increase in
postprocedural complications, including cholangitis, pancreati￾tis, and hemobilia. Recent publications have suggested that
cholangitis could negatively affect clinical outcome and prog￾nosis. So far it is still unclear whether ERCP or PTBD is the pre￾ferred preoperative drainage method. Our study aimed to in￾vestigate the optimal preoperative biliary drainage methods to
prevent post-procedural cholangitis in type II, III, and IV hilar
cholangiocarcinoma.
Patients and methods
Study design and patients
Between January 2011 and June 2017, 339 patients with hilar
bile duct stricture who required bile drainage were recruited
into the study. Diagnosis of HC depends on results of its clinical
manifestation, serum biomarkers and imaging examination.
Patients with malnutrition, hypoalbuminemia, suspected cho￾langitis, long-term jaundice, planned preoperative anti-neo￾plastic therapy and future liver remnant (FLR) < 30 % were con￾sidered to need preoperative bile drainage. One hundred fifty￾nine patients were excluded because of type I HC, hepatic duct
stones with stenosis, gallbladder carcinoma, metastatic tumors
of hilar, primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), IgG4-Related scle￾rosing cholangitis (IgG4-SC), hepatic echinococcosis, inability
to undergo percutaneous biliary drainage, or failure of ERCP or
placement of a percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography.
Eventually, 180 eligible patients with type II, III, and IV hilar
cholangiocarcinoma were included in this study (▶Fig. 1). Ac￾cording to the drainage method, the patients were divided
into two groups: ERCP group and PTBD group. The ERCP group
included patients who underwent endoscopic biliary stenting
(EBS) and endoscopic nasobiliary drainage (ENBD).
Drainage method
ERCP
When performing ERCP, bile duct cannulation and cholangio￾gram procedures were completed by using a duodenoscope
(TJF-260V, Olympus, Japan). In a general way, the guide wire
was inserted and crossed over the malignant obstruction site
to the proximal end of the hepatic bile duct. Considering that
patients may undergo radical cholangiocarcinoma resection

Conclusion Compared to ERCP, PTBD reduced the rate of
cholangitis, pancreatitis, salvage biliary drainage, and de￾creased hospitalization costs in patients with types II, III,
and IV HC. Risk of cholangitis for patients with types III and
IV was significantly lower in the PTBD group.

when jaundice reduction is satisfactory, one or two plastic bili￾ary stents or endoscopic nasobiliary drains were placed (8.5 Fr;
Boston Scientific, United States or Olympus, Japan). If the guide
wire first entered the bile duct on the side of the future rem￾nant lobe, a unilateral plastic stent or ENBD was usually placed;
if the guide wire entered the bile duct of the non-future rem￾nant lobe first and then the bile duct of the future remnant
lobe was selected, bilateral biliary stents were placed side by
side (▶Fig. 2a, ▶Fig. 2b). Generally speaking, ENBD was per￾formed when patients had difficulty during contrast agent ex￾cretion, or when bile was thick or full of dregs, which is easy to
clog drainage tubes. The upper edge of plastic stents and the
tip of the nasobiliary catheter (8 Fr/10.2 Fr; Cook Medical, Win￾ston-Salem, North Carolina, United States) should cross over
the upper margin of the malignant obstruction site by 2 cm.
PTBD
The dilated intrahepatic bile duct of the expected retention liv￾er was selected based on imaging findings. Ultrasound or x-ray￾guided percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography was
achieved by using a trocar to penetrate the target intrahepatic
bile duct. The guidewire was then advanced through the trocar
to lead the tube insertion. After the guidewire passed over the
malignant stenosis site and the duodenal papilla, a catheter
(7Fr; Olympus, Japan or Cook Medical, Winston-Salem, North
Carolina, United States) was placed with its distal end along
the guidewire in the duodenum for internal-external drainage.
PTBD external drainage was performed if the guidewire failed
to pass the malignant stenosis site of the intrahepatic bile
duct (▶Fig. 2c, ▶Fig. 2 d).
Data collection
Patient demographics, including age and sex, and biochemis￾try, including tumor marker CA19 – 9, white blood cell (WBC)
count, serum amylase level, and electrolytes were collected be￾fore the drainage procedure. Total bilirubin (TBIL) level, WBC,
serum amylase, and electrolyte levels were checked again at
24 and 48 hours and 1 and 2 weeks after biliary drainage. Data
on body temperature, color of bile, and abdominal pain score
(evaluated by numerical rating scale [NRS]) were also recorded.

Complications, including acute cholangitis, pancreatitis, and
hemobilia, were recorded [9]. Diagnostic criteria for acute cho￾langitis were based on the TG13 Tokyo Guidelines and included:
(1) upper abdominal pain (NRS ≥ 4); (2) fever (> 38.0℃) and/or
chills; (3) serum total bilirubin (TBIL) level > 34.2 μmol/L; and
(4) inflammatory response (WBC > 10,000/μL, CRP > 1 mg/dL)
[10]. The revised Atlanta classification of acute pancreatitis
was used to assess: (1) abdominal pain (NRS > 4) > 24 hours
after drainage; (2) amylase level more than three times normal
level; and (3) gastrointestinal perforation, acute cholecystitis or
acute peritonitis [11]. Clinical diagnosis of hemobilia consisted
of: (1) blood mixed with bile after biliary drainage; (2) slight
bleeding indicated by a small amount of black stool or positive
occult blood test; and (3) moderate to severe bleeding, indica￾ted by a drop in hemoglobin of 3 g/L, requiring blood transfu￾sion, angiographic intervention, or surgery [12, 13]. Successful
drainage was defined as a reduction in serum bilirubin level to <
50 % of the pre-drainage value within 2 weeks or normalization
after the procedure without any complications during the fol￾low-up period [14].
Statistical method
All statistical analyses were performed with Stata (version 12.0)
statistical software. Continuous variable data were reported as
mean ± SD for parametric data and median with interquartile
ranges (IQR) for nonparametric data or as counts and percenta￾ges for categorical variables. Continuous variables were also
expressed as ranges. We also compared baseline characteristics
and post-drainage complications. Data were analyzed by t-test,
and the χ2 test was used to investigate qualitative variables. Re￾sults were presented as relative risk (RR) with 95 % confidence
intervals (CIs), and P < 0.05 was considered statistically signifi￾cant.
Reported incidence of cholangitis after biliary drainage var￾ied from 22 % to 46 % [12]. Our prior experience showed a cho￾langitis rate of 40 %. To detect a difference with a significance
level (α) of 0.05 and a power of 80 % with a two-tailed test,
and to account for a 10 % loss to follow-up, it was estimated
that 150 patients were needed for the study. Therefore, we en￾rolled a total of 180 patients.
Results
Patient characteristics
A total of 180 patients were selected for the study, 99 patients
received ERCP, and 81 patients underwent PTBD. There were no
significant differences in patient demographics, including age,
sex, and Bismuth classification distribution. No significant dif￾ferences were noted in WBC count, TBIL, or tumor marker
CA19 – 9 between the two groups (P > 0.05) (▶Table 1).
Impact of ERCP and PTBD drainage on serum total
bilirubin
Of the 99 patients in the ERCP group, 34 underwent endoscopic
unilateral drainage with a single biliary stent, 46 patients had
bilateral biliary stent placement, and another 19 patients re￾ceived nasobiliary drainage. Forty-nine of the 81 patients in

the PTBD group had external drainage with the catheter tip left
above the obstruction and 32 had internal-external drainage
with the tip of the catheter in the duodenum. Compared with
pre-drainage, total bilirubin decreased significantly both in
the ERCP group (303.17 ± 182.72 vs. 126.87 ± 75.96, P =
0.001) and the PTBD group (332.14 ± 186.85 vs. 161.42 ±
93.11, P = 0.001) after 2 weeks of drainage. But there was no
statistical difference in decrease in total bilirubin between the
two groups (176.30 ± 106.76 in ERCP group vs. 170.72 ± 93.74
in PTBD group, P = 0.81) (▶Table 2).
Complications
Fifty-five of 180 patients (30.56 %) developed post-drainage
cholangitis: 37 in the ERCP group and 18 in the PTBD group.
Among them, 46 cases (83.64 %) of post-procedure acute cho￾langitis were considered as bacterial contamination originating
from the duodenum, eight cases (14.55 %) with drainage tube
migration and 1 case (1.81 %) with blockage of drainage tube
caused by hemobilia. Most fevers occurred within 24 hours
after intervention.
Incidence of cholangitis was significantly higher in the ERCP
group than in the PTBD group (37.37 % vs. 22.22%, P = 0.028).
Subgroup analysis showed similar results between the two
groups when comparing patients with types III and IV hilar ob￾struction (36.62 % in ERCP group vs. 18.03 % in PTBD group, P =
0.018). There was no significant difference in patients with type
II obstruction between the two groups (39.29 % in ERCP group
vs. 35.00 % in PTBD group, P = 0.762). Four of 180 patients
(2.22 %) had hemobilia, and there was no statistical difference
between the two groups (2.02 % in ERCP group vs. 2.47 % in
PTBD group, P = 0.76). Nineteen of 180 patients (10.56 %)
developed post-procedure pancreatitis, with significantly more
patients in the ERCP group than in the PTBD group (17 [17.17 %]
vs. 2 [2.47 %], P = 0.001). Twenty-three of 180 (12.78 %) patients
required salvage biliary drainage, again with significantly more
patients in the ERCP group than in the PTBD (18 [18.18 %] vs. 5
[6.17%], P = 0.029) (▶Fig. 3). The type II HC patients who re￾ceived unilateral stent placement had the lowest rate of post￾drainage cholangitis and types III or IV HC patients with PTBD
external drainage had the lowest incidence of cholangitis
(▶Fig. 4).
Incidence of cholangitis in various subgroups
In the ERCP group, patients with endoscopic bilateral biliary
stent placement had a higher rate of post-drainage cholangitis
than those who received unilateral biliary stent placement
(50.00% vs. 26.47%, P = 0.034). There was no significant differ￾ence between those who had endoscopic unilateral stenting
and those who had endoscopic nasobiliary drainage (ENBD)
(26.47 % vs. 26.32 %, P = 0.99). For the PTBD group, patients
who underwent PTBD internal-external drainage had a higher
rate of cholangitis than those with only external drainage
(34.36% vs. 14.29%, P = 0.034) (▶Fig. 3).
Discussion
Preoperative biliary drainage plays a positive role in enhancing
surgical safety for patients with types II, III, and IV potentially
resectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma with jaundice. This meth￾od not only improves retention of liver function after radical

surgery, but also speeds regeneration of the remnant liver [15].
It also should be noted that not all patients can benefit from
preoperative biliary drainage, for instance, those with drain￾age-associated cholangitis, a critical predictor that can result
in liver insufficiency and liver failure and could even increase
the chance of mortality after radical surgery [16 – 18]. Current￾ly, there is no consensus about how preoperative biliary drain￾age should be performed worldwide. Kloek JJ et al [19] found
that preoperative PTBD could outperform EBS in patients with
resectable HC, because PTBD was associated with fewer infec￾tious complications and involved fewer procedures. A Japanese
clinical practical guideline [20], however, recommended ERCP
as the first choice for preoperative drainage of biliary tract can￾cers. It is important to note that the guideline was aimed at all
biliary tract cancers rather than HC. How to define the optimal
method is still debated.
The basis of an ideal drainage plan is maximization of drain￾age volume of the expected retention liver and minimization of
drainage-associated cholangitis at the same time [21]. To drain
bile from the future remnant lobe adequately, bilateral plastic
stents (t2 stents) were inserted in the bile duct of the retained
liver during our ERCP operations. Vienne et al reported that
they needed double-sided stent insertion if more than 50 % of
the liver drainage volume was expected, but our results showed
that single-sided stent insertion could also produce a good
jaundice reduction effect [22]. Both the double-sided stent in￾sertion group and the single-sided stent insertion group with
types III and IV potentially resectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma
exhibited obvious bilirubin number reduction and similar levels
of bilirubin drop (P = 0.01). Besides this, jaundice reduction ef￾fects were also similar in the ERCP and PTBD groups and in their
corresponding subgroups (P > 0.05).
The US consensus statement on hilar cholangiocarcinoma
published in 2013 suggested that PTBD is superior in reducing
risks of complications [23]. We recently published results of a
meta-analysis that testify to PTBD as the preferred initial drain￾age method for patients with types II, III, and IV tumor obstruc￾tion [24]. Many centers also reported a higher incidence of
acute cholangitis after ERCP. Min et al. reported 106 cases of hi￾lar cholangiocarcinoma, with 44 undergoing ERCP versus 62
with PTBD. They found higher rates of cholangitis in the ERCP
group than in the PTBD group (54.5% vs. 22.6%, P < 0.05) [25].
In our research, we found that incidence of post-drainage cho￾langitis, pancreatitis, and secondary remedial biliary drainage
were greater in the ERCP group than in the PTBD group (P <
0.05). We analyzed the relationship between post-drainage
cholangitis and Bismuth-Corlette classification and found that
type II HC patients showed no difference in incidence of post￾drainage cholangitis (39.29 % vs. 35.00%, P = 0.762), only with
types III and IV HC was incidence of post-drainage cholangitis
higher in the ERCP group than in the PTBD group (36.62 % vs.
18.03%, P = 0.018).
Choice of endoscopic unilateral stenting versus bilateral
stenting remains controversial. De Palma found that rates of
cholangitis were higher with bilateral stenting than with unilat￾eral stenting (16.6% vs. 8.8%, P < 0.05) [26]. Iwano reported
that liver abscesses occurred more frequently in the bilateral
stenting group than in the unilateral stenting group (17.6 % vs.
1.5%, P < 0.05) [27]. In our study, incidence of cholangitis was
significantly higher among patients with endoscopic bilateral
drainage than in those with endoscopic unilateral drainage
(50.00% vs. 26.47%, P = 0.034). Considering patients with types
II, III, and IV potentially resectable HC whose operative treat￾ment should be performed soon after the diagnosis is ascer￾tained, endoscopic unilateral stenting and endoscopic bilateral
biliary stents were no different in drainage effect. Besides, inci￾dence of post-drainage cholangitis from endoscopic bilateral
biliary stent insertion was higher, so there were more advanta￾ges to unilateral endoscopic biliary stenting for radical resec￾tion of hilar cholangiocarcinoma, particularly in type II or III
cases.
Some endoscopists have advocated use of ENBD for preo￾perative biliary drainage for hilar cholangiocarcinoma. Kawaka￾mi reported that cholangitis secondary to stent occlusion was
significantly more common in the stenting group than in the
ENBD group (60.0% vs. 10.0 %, P < 0.05). The nasobiliary cathe￾ter may have negative pressure, making the bile flow more
easily [28]. However, we observed that the cholangitis rate
was comparable between the group with endoscopic unilateral
stenting insertion and the ENBD group (26.47 % vs. 26.32%, P =
0.99). ENBD has the disadvantage of causing nose discomfort
and is at risk of dislocation. Because external bile loss leads to
water-electrolyte imbalance, radical resection of hilar tumor is
recommended within 4 weeks of ENBD placement. An alterna￾tive option to provide internal drainage is cutting the ENBD
tube, using a pair of endoscopic scissors, and leaving the tip of
the drain in the stomach to minimize risk of external bile loss.
In patients with PTBD, internal drainage is achieved by leav￾ing the tip of the drain catheter in the duodenum. Internal
drainage minimizes external bile loss and maintains water-elec￾trolyte balance, which also improves nutritional status [29]. In
our study, incidence of cholangitis in those with external/inter￾nal drainage was higher than in those with external drainage
alone (34.36 % vs. 14.29 %, P = 0.034). We hypothesized that

the difference in incidence of cholangitis was secondary to re￾flux of duodenal content into the biliary system through the
catheter when the tip is placed in the duodenum. Comparing
patients with endoscopic single stent placement, ENBD, and
those with external drainage alone in the PTBD group, inci￾dence of cholangitis was 26.47 %, 26.32 %, and 14.29 %, respec￾tively. Although endoscopic unilateral stenting insertion and
ENBD can reduce incidence of cholangitis, PTBD with external
drainage resulted in the lowest incidence of cholangitis. PTBD
with external drainage alone may be the preferred drainage
method, especially for salvage biliary drainage when endo￾scopic stenting fails.
Many aspects of preoperative biliary drainage need to be
considered for patients with types II, III, and IV HC. Our results
appeared to show that PTBD external drainage for types III and
IV HC has more advantages. Individualized experience with
drainage operation is also a necessity, and the competency of
the hospital’s biliary intervention or endoscopic techniques
should be considered comprehensively. The study also has
some limitations. It was single-center and retrospective with a
relatively small number of patients. Data on long-term clinical
outcomes, including stent patency and patient surgical mortal￾ity during follow-up are limited. A prospective, randomized
controlled trial with a larger number of patients is needed.
Conclusion
In conclusion, percutaneous transhepatic biliary external drain￾age may be the preferred preoperative drainage method for hi￾lar cholangiocarcinoma because of its low incidence of cholan￾gitis and pancreatitis. If a patient is not suitable for PTBD, uni￾lateral EBS or ENBD can be used as a secondary option.
