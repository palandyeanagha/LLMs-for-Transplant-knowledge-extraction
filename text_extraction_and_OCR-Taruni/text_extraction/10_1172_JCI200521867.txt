Vitamin D controls calcium homeostasis and the development and maintenance of bones through vitamin D 
receptor activation. Prolonged therapy with rifampicin or phenobarbital has been shown to cause vitamin D 
deficiency or osteomalacia, particularly in patients with marginal vitamin D stores. However, the molecular 
mechanism of this process is unknown. Here we show that these drugs lead to the upregulation of 25-hydroxyvi￾tamin D3-24-hydroxylase (CYP24) gene expression through the activation of the nuclear receptor pregnane X 
receptor (PXR; NR1I2). CYP24 is a mitochondrial enzyme responsible for inactivating vitamin D metabolites. 
CYP24 mRNA is upregulated in vivo in mice by pregnenolone 16α-carbonitrile and dexamethasone, 2 murine 
PXR agonists, and in vitro in human hepatocytes by rifampicin and hyperforin, 2 human PXR agonists. More￾over, rifampicin increased 24-hydroxylase activity in these cells, while, in vivo in mice, pregnenolone 16α-car￾bonitrile increased the plasma concentration of 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Transfection of PXR in human 
embryonic kidney cells resulted in rifampicin-mediated induction of CYP24 mRNA. Analysis of the human 
CYP24 promoter showed that PXR transactivates the sequence between –326 and –142. We demonstrated that 
PXR binds to and transactivates the 2 proximal vitamin D–responsive elements of the human CYP24 promoter. 
These data suggest that xenobiotics and drugs can modulate CYP24 gene expression and alter vitamin D3 hor￾monal activity and calcium homeostasis through the activation of PXR.
Introduction
Vitamin D is essential for the maintenance of calcium homeostasis 
and for the development and maintenance of bones. Before 
acquiring its biological potential, vitamin D is transformed into 
25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3], the major form of vitamin 
D in the circulation, by two 25-hydroxylases (the mitochondrial 
CYP27A, and the microsomal CYP2R1) mainly expressed in the 
liver (1, 2). The 25(OH)D3 is further hydroxylated in the 1α posi￾tion to form 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1α,25(OH)2D3], by the 
CYP27B1 mainly expressed in the kidney (3). The active form of 
vitamin D3, 1α,25(OH)2D3, elicits most of its biological effects by 
binding to a high-affinity receptor, the vitamin D receptor (VDR; 
NR1I1) (4). After binding 1α,25(OH)2D3, VDR forms heterodimers 
with the retinoid X receptor (RXR; NR2B1) and then binds to and 
transactivates the vitamin D–responsive elements (VDREs) present 
in the regulatory region of target genes (5). The classical VDREs 
consist of a direct repeat of nuclear receptor half-sites separated 
by 3 nucleotides (DR3) (6). In the classical vitamin D–responsive 
organs, including the intestine, bone, kidney, and parathyroid 
gland, vitamin D3–activated VDR plays a central role in the regula￾tion of calcium and phosphate homeostasis, bone mineralization, 
inhibition of cell growth, and parathyroid hormone synthesis (3, 7). 
VDR is also expressed in many other nonclassical vitamin D–
responsive organs, including the liver (8, 9).
The potent role of 1α,25(OH)2D3 in the regulation of serum calci￾um and phosphate levels requires a tight control of its blood concen￾tration. This is reached through the balance between the rates of syn￾thesis and degradation. CYP24 is a multifunctional 24-hydroxylase 
and the major catabolic enzyme of vitamin D (10). It directs the side￾chain oxidation and cleavage of 1,25(OH)2D and 25(OH)D to cata￾bolic carboxylic acid end products. Notably, this enzyme converts 
1α,25(OH)2D3 into 1α,24,25(OH)3D3, a product with decreased hor￾monal activity (3), and further into calcitroic acid, known as the final 
metabolite of 1α,25(OH)2D3 excreted in bile. Hypocalcemia increases 
the serum levels of 1α,25(OH)2D3 through stimulation of 1α-hydroxy￾lase (2) and suppresses the CYP24 activity through increased levels 
of parathyroid hormone (10). Inversely, hypercalcemia depresses 
1α-hydroxylase and increases the 24-hydroxylase activity, and high 
levels of 1α,25(OH)2D3 induce the 24-hydroxylase activity through 
VDR (11). The important role of the CYP24 gene has been further 
demonstrated in CYP24 knockout mice, which exhibit high ambient 
1α,25(OH)2D3 levels and abnormal bone mineralization (12).
Osteomalacia is a metabolic bone disease, characterized by a 
defect of bone mineralization that can be caused by vitamin D 
deficiency or genetic alterations of vitamin D metabolism, vitamin 
D action, or other factors involved in the phosphocalcic metabo￾lism. This pathology has also been suspected to result from the 
adverse effects of drugs. Some of the drugs most frequently associ￾ated with osteomalacia are phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampicin,

and carbamazepine (13–17). Indeed, long-term antiepileptic drug 
therapy, such as phenobarbital or carbamazepine, is a known risk 
factor for bone loss and fractures (13). In addition, prolonged ther￾apy with rifampicin can cause vitamin D deficiency or osteomala￾cia (18), particularly in patients with marginal vitamin D stores 
(19). Notably, 2 weeks of rifampicin treatment reduces the levels 
of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin 
D in healthy subjects (20). The molecular mechanism of this drug￾induced osteomalacia or vitamin deficiency is unknown. However, 
one interesting feature is that rifampicin (21), phenobarbital (22), 
phenytoin (23), and carbamazepine (24) are inducers of the hepatic 
cytochrome P450s (CYPs) involved in drug metabolism, i.e., CYP2B 
and CYP3A. These observations suggested to us that the orphan 
nuclear receptor pregnane X receptor (PXR; NR1I2 [ref. 25]) might 
be involved in this phenomenon. PXR has been shown to mediate 
CYP2 and CYP3 gene induction (25, 26) and is activated by a wide 
variety of commonly used drugs, notably rifampicin (25) and phe￾nobarbital (25) but also carbamazepine (27) and phenytoin (27).
In close similarity to VDR and the enzymes involved in vitamin D 
biosynthesis and metabolism, PXR is expressed in intestine, kidney, 
and liver (25, 28), and both receptors share around 60% similarity of 
amino acids in their DNA-binding domains. Moreover, even though 
their ligand-binding domains share only 37% identity, lithocholic 
acid and derivatives act as ligands for both PXR and VDR (29). PXR 
interacts with its cognate response elements in the 5′-flanking regions 
of target genes by forming heterodimers with RXRα. Typically, these 
elements contain 2 copies of the AG(G/T)TCA hexanucleotide orga￾nized as a direct repeat with a 3- to 4-bp spacer (DR3, DR4), or an 
everted repeat separated by 6 bp (ER6) (30). Some of these elements 
are also recognized by VDR after heterodimerization with RXR, as 
shown with iNOS (31), CYP3A4 (32, 33), CYP2B6, and CYP2C9 (8). 
These observations suggest to us that these receptors are capable of 
regulating common genes through the same cis-acting elements. This 
could represent an example of functional nuclear receptor cross-talk, 
suggesting that PXR activators might interfere with VDR-controlled 
physiological processes. Here, we test this hypothesis and provide 
data suggesting that PXR is involved in drug-induced osteomalacia 
by upregulating CYP24, the major enzyme responsible for the bio￾logical catabolism of vitamin D hormone.
Results
Induction of CYP24 gene expression and CYP24 activity by PXR activa￾tors in human hepatocytes. We first investigated the effects of PXR 
activators on the expression of key proteins involved in vitamin 
D3 homeostasis, i.e., the mitochondrial 25-hydroxylase CYP27A, 
the microsomal 25-hydroxylase CYP2R1, the 1α-hydroxylase 
CYP27B, the 24-hydroxylase CYP24, and VDR. Forty-eight hours 
after plating, human hepatocytes were treated with 1α,25(OH)2D3
(50 nM) or PXR activators such as rifampicin (10 μM), hyperforin 
(2 μM), carbamazepine (20 μM), and phenobarbital (500 μM) for 
48 hours. CYP24, CYP2R1, VDR, CYP27B, and CYP27A mRNAs 
were then analyzed by real-time quantitative RT-PCR using the 
LightCycler apparatus (Roche Diagnostics Corp.), in parallel 
with CYP3A4 mRNA as a control for PXR activation. We evalu￾ated the induction ratios (mRNA levels in treated cells compared 
with control cells after normalization with respect to GAPDH 
signal) obtained from the analysis of 5 different cultures from 
5 different liver donors. GAPDH and β-actin mRNA levels (data 
not shown) were used as quality controls of RNA preparations 
and RT reactions. As expected, vehicle-treated cells expressed very 
low levels of CYP24 (cycle threshold [Ct] = 37 ± 2 cycles), VDR 
(Ct = 32 ± 4), and CYP27B (Ct = 32 ± 2) mRNAs compared with 
CYP27A (Ct = 24 ± 1), CYP3A4 (Ct = 25 ± 5), CYP2R1 (Ct = 26 ± 2), 
and GAPDH (Ct = 17 ± 2).

Human hepatocytes were cultured for 48 hours 
in the absence (UT) or presence of the indi￾cated compounds: 50 nM 1α,25(OH)2D3 (VD3), 
20 μM rifampicin (RIF), 2 μM hyperforin (HP), 
20 μM carbamazepine (CARBA), or 500 μM 
phenobarbital (PB). Total RNA was isolated 
using TRIZOL reagent. One microgram of total 
RNA was reverse-transcribed, and CYP3A4, 
CYP24, CYP2R1, CYP27B, CYP27A, VDR, 
and GAPDH mRNAs were quantified by real￾time RT-PCR analysis using the LightCycler 
apparatus (Roche Diagnostics Corp.). Data

cultures from 5 different liver donors) of the

themselves exhibited no significant variation.

As shown in Figure 1, expression of CYP3A4 mRNA was signifi￾cantly induced by all of the compounds tested, although more 
modestly by 1α,25(OH)2D3 (5-fold induction). In addition, expres￾sion of CYP24 mRNA was strongly induced by 1α,25(OH)2D3
(47-fold induction). Interestingly, expression of CYP24 mRNA was 
significantly (P < 0.05) increased by rifampicin (20-fold induction), 
hyperforin (11-fold induction), and phenobarbital (12-fold induc￾tion). Carbamazepine was a weak, nonsignificant (P > 0.07) induc￾er of CYP24. The relative induction potency of rifampicin, hyper￾forin, carbamazepine, and phenobarbital was identical for CYP3A4 
and CYP24 genes: i.e., rifampicin > phenobarbital > hyperforin > 
carbamazepine. In contrast, 1α,25(OH)2D3 was a weak inducer of 
CYP3A4 compared with rifampicin or the other PXR activators 
but appeared as the most potent inducer of the CYP24 gene. As 
previously observed in other tissues (34), 1α,25(OH)2D3 produced 
a significant decrease (50% inhibition, P < 0.01) of the CYP27B1 
mRNA level (Figure 1). In contrast, rifampicin, hyperforin, or 
phenobarbital did not affect the expression of this mRNA. The 
level of VDR mRNA in human hepatocytes was not affected by the 
drugs used, except by 1α,25(OH)2D3 (2.2-fold increase). The levels 
of mRNA encoding 2 enzymes involved in the 25-hydroxylation of 
vitamin D3 (i.e., the mitochondrial CYP27A and the recently “de￾orphanized” microsomal CYP2R1) were not affected by any of the 
compounds tested, even by 1α,25(OH)2D3.
Next, we compared the extent of mRNA induction of the main 
PXR target gene, CYP3A4, to the extent of mRNA induction of 
CYP24 at various time points (from 6 to 48 hours with 20 μM rifam￾picin; Figure 2A), and with increasing concentrations of rifampi￾cin (from 1 to 20 μM after 48 hours of treatment; Figure 2B). 
As shown, both the time-course and the dose-response profiles 
of induction were similar for CYP3A4 and CYP24 mRNAs. To 
determine whether xenobiotics induce CYP24 mRNA directly 
or indirectly, human hepatocytes were treated with rifampicin 
in the absence or presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor 
cycloheximide (CHX) for 24 hours, and RNA was analyzed by 
semiquantitative RT-PCR using primers for CYP24 and GAPDH 
as control. As shown in Figure 2C, the rifampicin-mediated 
induction of CYP24 mRNA was not affected by CHX, although 
the latter compound alone increased the expression of CYP24 
mRNA. It is likely that this results from an mRNA stabilization 
effect of this compound. In contrast, the GAPDH mRNA level 
was not affected by these treatments.
To investigate whether CYP24 mRNA accumulation coincided 
with an increase in the rate of 24-hydroxylation of vitamin D3, 
the metabolism of 3H-25(OH)D3 was evaluated. For this purpose, 
human hepatocytes were treated with 1α,25(OH)2D3 (50 nM) 
or 20 μM rifampicin for 72 hours, and then incubated for 4 
hours with 3H-25(OH)D3. A significant increase of 24,25(OH)2D3
production was observed both after 1α,25(OH)2D3 treatment 
(3.79-fold induction, P < 0.001) and after rifampicin treatment 
(1.58-fold induction, P < 0.02) (Table 1). The potency of these 
compounds to increase the rate of 24-hydroxylation of 25(OH)D3
parallels their ability to induce CYP24 mRNA accumulation [i.e., 
1α,25(OH)2D3 > rifampicin].
In vivo induction of mouse CYP24 mRNA and 24,25(OH)2D3 plasma 
concentration by PXR agonists. To determine whether activators of 
PXR induce CYP24 in vivo, mice (n = 5) were treated for 6 days with 
dexamethasone or pregnenolone 16α-carbonitrile, 2 well-known 
murine PXR agonists (28), or corn oil plus 5% DMSO (vehicle). Total 
RNA was prepared from liver and kidney and analyzed for cyp3a11, 
cyp24, and cyclophilin (internal control) gene expression by real￾time PCR. As expected, the cyp3a11 mRNA level was significantly 
(P < 0.01) and strongly increased by dexamethasone (16.3-fold) 
and pregnenolone 16α-carbonitrile (9.7-fold) in the liver of treated 
mice in comparison to the level in vehicle-treated mice (Figure 3A). 
More interestingly, dexamethasone and pregnenolone 16α-carbo￾nitrile provoked a significant increase of cyp24 mRNA expression 
in kidney, 4.6-fold (P = 0.0005) and 2.2-fold (P = 0.0019) induction, 
respectively (Figure 3B). In addition, we measured changes in the 
plasma concentration of vitamin D metabolites [24,25(OH)2D3
and 25(OH)D3] after 1 week of pregnenolone 16α-carbonitrile 
treatment. As shown in Figure 3C, pregnenolone 16α-carboni￾trile provoked a significant increase of 24,25(OH)2D3 plasma level 
(2.01-fold induction, P < 0.03), while no significant effect was 
observed on 25(OH)D3 circulating level (Figure 3D).

tion of the CYP24 gene. To further document this point, we first 
established a stable human embryonic kidney cell line (Hek293) 
expressing the human PXR protein. For this purpose, Hek293 
cells were transfected with pIRES-hPXR/neo expression plasmid 
and cultured 3 weeks in a selection medium containing 600 μg/μl 
G418. Several colonies were amplified and tested for their ability to 
express PXR protein, and 1 of them was used for subsequent stud￾ies. As shown in Figure 4A, this cell line (Hek293-hPXR) expresses 
human PXR protein, as assessed by Western blotting performed 
with an anti–human PXR serum, while the parental Hek293 cells do 
not. Moreover, in contrast to the parental cells, these cells respond 
to rifampicin, as observed in transient transfection assays using a 
CYP2B6 (NR1)3-tkLUC reporter construct, which contains 3 repeats 
of a functional PXR-responsive element of the CYP2B6 gene (26) 
(Figure 4B). We then analyzed the effect of 1α,25(OH)2D3 (50 nM), 
rifampicin (10 μM), or hyperforin (2 μM) on the endogenous 
CYP24 mRNA level in both parental and PXR-expressing Hek293 
cell lines. As shown in Figure 4C, treatment with 1α,25(OH)2D3 for 
48 hours produced 9- and 7-fold inductions of CYP24 mRNA in the 
parental cells (reflecting the endogenous expression of VDR) and 
in Hek293-hPXR cells, respectively. In contrast, while rifampicin 
and hyperforin had no effect on CYP24 mRNA expression in con￾trol cells, these compounds produced 4.5- and 3-fold increases of 
CYP24 mRNA in the Hek293-hPXR cells, respectively.
The cloning of the human CYP24 promoter has been reported 
(35). To determine the nature of the cis-acting elements involved 
in PXR-mediated CYP24 gene expression, analysis of promoter 
transcriptional activity was undertaken. Various deletions of the 
human CYP24 promoter were constructed into a promoterless 
luciferase reporter vector (pGL3basic; Figure 5A). These con￾structs were tested for their ability to respond to PXR by transient 
cotransfection assays in Hek293 cells. In response to rifampicin, 
the luciferase activity of the 1.2-kb promoter fragment (–1,200 to 
–22) exhibited a 4-fold increase under cotransfection with human 
PXR cDNA expression vector (Figure 5B). The magnitude of the 
response was identical to that observed with the –326 to –22 
construct. However, the –144 to –22 construct did not respond 
to rifampicin. Similar results were obtained with pregnenolone 
16α-carbonitrile and a mouse PXR expression vector. Therefore, 
the –326 to –144 region of the CYP24 promoter confers response 
to both human and murine PXR. Interestingly, this region is 
responsive to 1α,25(OH)2D3 even in the absence of cotransfection 
of the receptor expression vector (Figure 5B), because Hek293 
cells express endogenous VDR (36). Indeed, 2 VDREs have been 
defined within the –300 to –150 region of the human and mouse 
CYP24 promoter that confer response of the promoter to both 
1α,25(OH)2D3 (35) and RXR ligands (37).
PXR binds to and transactivates the VDRE-I and VDRE-II motifs of 
human CYP24 promoter. We have previously reported that VDR 
binds to and transactivates PXR-responsive elements present on 
the promoter of several CYP genes, including CYP2C9, CYP2B6, 
and CYP3A4. This suggested that these receptors could share DNA￾responsive elements and target genes (8). The –316 to –144 region 
of the human CYP24 promoter contains 3 potential binding sites 
for PXR: 2 VDREs previously identified, –294 to –274 (VDRE-II)
and –174 to –151 (VDRE-I), and the –316 to –291 region (CYP24 
site 3), which contains sequences that are homologous with various

repeat motifs (Figure 6A). The ability of these sequences to bind 
to the PXR:RXRα heterodimer was tested by competition in elec￾trophoretic mobility shift assays using the proximal PXR-respon￾sive element of CYP3A4 (ER6 motif [ref. 25]). PXR and RXRα were 
prepared by in vitro translation of their cDNAs. As expected, PXR:
RXRα heterodimer produced a retarded band with the CYP3A4 ER6 
probe (Figure 6B, lane 1), which was decreased by an excess of ER6 
unlabeled probe (lanes 3 and 4). Interestingly, the 2 CYP24 VDREs 
produced a dose-dependent decrease of PXR:RXRα binding to the 
CYP3A4 ER6 probe (Figure 6B, lanes 5–8), which suggests direct 
competition between the CYP3A4 ER6 and VDRE motifs in the 
interaction with PXR:RXRα heterodimers. In contrast, the CYP24 
–316 to –291 region (site 3) failed to compete with the CYP3A4 ER6 
probe (Figure 6B, lane 2), which suggests that this element is not 
required for PXR-mediated CYP24 gene induction.
To test the direct interaction between PXR and the 2 VDREs of 
the CYP24 promoter, oligonucleotides VDRE-I (Figure 7, lanes 
1–6) and VDRE-II (lanes 7–12) were end-labeled and subjected 
to electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Note that the reticulo￾cyte lysate produced a nonspecific retarded band (Figure 7, NS). 
Nevertheless, in vitro–synthesized PXR:RXRα and VDR:RXRα
heterodimers efficiently bound to the 2 CYP24 VDRE motifs 
(Figure 7, lanes 5, 6, 11, and 12). This binding was observed only in 
the presence of the heterodimerization partner RXRα, while nei￾ther PXR, RXRα, nor VDR alone bound to these sequences. These 
results strongly suggest that the PXR:RXRα heterodimer binds to 
the 2 VDREs of the human CYP24 promoter.
To demonstrate further the role of CYP24 VDRE-I and VDRE-II

constructs exhibited increased luciferase activity in response to 
1α,25(OH)2D3, even in the absence of the cotransfected recep￾tor (7- and 4-fold induction, respectively). This induction was 
increased in the presence of VDR. Interestingly, in both VDRE-I 
and VDRE-II reporter constructs, rifampicin produced an increase 
in reporter activity (approximately 4- to 6-fold induction) only in 
the presence of PXR cotransfection. In contrast, the luciferase 
activity of the site 3 reporter construct was affected neither by 
1α,25(OH)2D3 treatment nor by rifampicin-activated PXR. We 
then introduced specific mutations into VDRE-I and VDRE-II 
motifs in the native CYP24 promoter (–326 to –22) by means of 
PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. The effect of PXR on these 
mutated CYP24 gene promoters was investigated by transient 
transfection experiments. As shown in Figure 8B, the mutation in 
VDRE-I caused a strong decrease in both the VDR-dependent and 
the PXR-dependent luciferase induction. On the other hand, intro￾duction of the mutation into VDRE-II retained half of the VDR 
response, while it completely abolished PXR-dependent luciferase 
induction. Double mutations in both VDRE-I and VDRE-II com￾pletely abolished both VDR and PXR response. These results dem￾onstrate that PXR binds to and transactivates the 2 VDRE motifs 
present in the human CYP24 promoter.
Discussion
Recent studies have shown that the orphan nuclear receptor PXR 
plays a central role in the transcriptional regulation of enzymes 
and transporters involved in detoxification, such as CYP3A4 and 
MDR1 (38). PXR is activated by a number of pharmaceutical 
agents, including rifampicin, SR12813, taxol, clotrimazole, pheno￾barbital, hyperforin, the herbal antidepressant St. John’s wort (39), 
and HIV protease inhibitors such as ritonavir and saquivanir (40). 
PXR functions as a sensor to regulate xenobiotic clearance in the 
liver and intestine. Indeed, gene knockout studies have confirmed 
the role of PXR in the regulation of the metabolism of endogenous 
steroids and dietary and xenobiotic compounds (41). Interestingly, 
recent studies have demonstrated that PXR and VDR might signal 
through the same DNA-responsive elements, notably in iNOS (31), 
CYP3A4 (32, 33), CYP2B6 (8), and CYP2C9 (8) genes. In addition, 
VDR (29) and PXR (42) share ligands, such as the secondary bile 
acid lithocholic acid. These observations suggest the possibility of 
functional cross-talk between PXR and VDR.
The results described here show that PXR activators increase the 
expression of CYP24, a VDR target gene, not only in cultured cells 
(primary culture of human hepatocytes and embryonic kidney cell 
line) but also in vivo in mice. In fact, we observed that CYP24 and 
CYP3A4, a typical PXR target gene, displayed similar dose-depen￾dent and kinetic profiles of induction by PXR agonists, suggest￾ing a common mechanism of regulation of these genes. CYP24 is

a multifunctional enzyme that directs the side-chain oxidation and 
cleavage of 25(OH)D3 and 1,25(OH)2D3 to catabolic carboxylic acid 
end products (43). It is well established that induction of the rat 
CYP24 gene by 1,25(OH)2D3 is mediated by 2 VDREs located about 
100 bp apart within the 300-bp proximal promoter (35). In human 
hepatocytes, PXR-mediated CYP24 mRNA accumulation was not 
inhibited by CHX pretreatment, which suggests a direct effect of 
PXR on CYP24 gene expression. In addition, transfection studies in 
human embryonic kidney cells demonstrated that both human PXR 
and mouse PXR directly transactivate the CYP24 promoter. More￾over, we found that PXR binds to and transactivates the 2 proximal 
VDREs present in the CYP24 promoter. Point mutations within the 
5′ half-site of either the upstream VDRE (ΔVDRE-II) or the down￾stream VDRE (ΔVDRE-I) led to a total inhibition of PXR-mediated 
induction of luciferase activity, which suggests that both sites are 
required for an efficient PXR-mediated CYP24 gene expression. 
Such cooperation between several PXREs is frequently observed 
within PXR target genes. In summary, our results demonstrate that 
CYP24 is a VDR target gene as well as a PXR target gene. Moreover, 
we observed that, in vivo in mice, activation of PXR by pregneno￾lone 16α-carbonitrile significantly increased the circulating level 
of 24,25(OH)2D3 (2-fold induction). These results fully prove our 
hypothesis and are in agreement with those previously obtained by 
others. Indeed, pharmacological doses of dexamethasone, another 
mouse PXR agonist and cyp3a inducer (28), increase intestinal and 
renal cyp24 mRNA accumulation and enzyme activity (44).
Since 24-hydroxylation is the initial enzymatic step in the 
catabolism of 1,25(OH)2D3, increased cyp24 gene expression and 
24(OH)-ase activity might be expected to result in lower cellular 
concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D3 and, therefore, lower expression 
of VDR target genes (Figure 9). Indeed, many reports show that 
drugs now identified as PXR activators produce vitamin D defi￾ciency and increase the risk of bone fracture. It is well-known 
that long term treatment with phenytoin, phenobarbital, rifam￾picin, or carbamazepine impairs bioavailability of vitamin D and 
bone mineralization, leading to osteomalacia and osteoporosis 
(13, 15–18, 20, 45–47). Consistent with this, it has been observed 
that the circulating level of 25(OH)D3 or 1,25(OH)2D3 is decreased 
by these drugs (18, 20, 48, 49). In addition, osteopenia, osteopo￾rosis, and osteonecrosis are the most significant bone disorders 
affecting patients suffering from HIV infection (50), and HIV￾infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy have a high 
prevalence of reduced bone mineral density (51). The mechanisms 
of these phenomena are complex and unclear. However, a part of 
these effects might be the consequence of CYP24 gene upregulation 
induced by the activation of PXR. Indeed, protease inhibitors have 
been suspected to play some role in this process (52, 53), and 2 of 
them, ritonavir and saquinavir (27, 40), are PXR agonists.
In the most classical view of molecular toxicology, undesirable 
effects of xenobiotics are primarily ascribed to the chemical reactiv￾ity of the parent compounds and/or of some of their metabolites 
that are produced during oxidative metabolism mediated notably 
by CYPs (e.g., covalent binding to proteins and DNA, effects on 
membrane lipids, etc.). A second aspect of the undesirable effects 
of xenobiotics results from the fact that these compounds may 
affect the level and activity of xenobiotic detoxification systems 
(interactions, induction, and inhibition). In this respect, although 
PXR evolved to protect the body from xenobiotic-mediated toxic 
effects, its activation by some drugs represents the basis for a com￾mon class of potentially life-threatening drug interactions in which 
one drug accelerates the metabolism of another (54). The cross-talk 
described here between PXR and VDR represents another aspect of 
the undesirable effects of xenobiotics, in which a xenobiotic-medi￾ated increase in endobiotic-compound metabolism/catabolism can 
lead to endocrine system perturbation.

Plasmids. The following plasmids have been described previously: pSG5-
ΔATG-hPXR (28), pSG5-mPXR (28), pSG5-mRXRα (8), and pSG5-hVDR 
(8). pIRES-hPXR/neo plasmid was generated by PCR amplification (High￾Fidelity PCR system; F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd.) of cDNA encoding 
amino acids 1–434 of human PXR using oligonucleotides 5′-GGGTGT￾GGGGAATTCACCACCATGGAGGTGAGACCCAAAGAAAGC and 5′-
GGGTGTGGGGGATCCTCAGCTACCTGTGATGCCG and insertion into 
pIRESneo (BD Biosciences — Clontech) digested with EcoRI/BamHI.
Human CYP24 promoter deletions were obtained by PCR (Pfu poly￾merase; Promega Corp.) using CYP24 forward 18-mer oligonucleotide 
primers (–1,200 to –1,182, –326 to –308, or –144 to –126) with an over￾hanging SalI site immediately upstream of the 5′-most base of the deletion 
construct; a common 3′ primer, TGCATTTATGGAGACAGA (CYP24 –39 
to –22); and the human CYP24 (–1,250 to +99) pBLCAT3 plasmid as a 
template (a gift from H.F. DeLuca, University of Wisconsin — Madison, 
Madison, Wisconsin, USA). PCR products were then digested by SacI and 
subcloned in SacI/SmaI–linearized pGL3basic vector (Promega Corp.) to 
produce –1,200-LUC, –326-LUC, and –144-LUC constructs.
pGL3tkLUC plasmid was obtained by ligation of the HindIII/BglII tk-SEAP 
vector fragment (BD Biosciences — Clontech), corresponding to the minimal 
147nt long tk promoter, into the HindIII/BglII–linearized pGL3basic vector. 
Oligonucleotides corresponding to the individual CYP2B6 NR1 (55), CYP24 
site 3 (–316 to –291), and VDREs (VDRE-II, –294 to –274, and VDRE-I, 
–174 to –151) (37) were synthesized with BamHI and BglII ends, annealed, 
and ligated, and 3 copies were subcloned into the BamHI/BglII–digested 
pGL3tk. The resulting (NR1)3-tkLUC, (site 3)3-tkLUC, (VDRE-II)3-tkLUC, 
and (VDRE-I)3-tkLUC were verified by sequencing.
The specific mutations of the VDREs in the native CYP24 promoter 
(–326 to –22) were introduced by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis 
(QuikChange PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis kit; Stratagene) 
using –326-LUC vector as a template to produce ΔVDRE-I (–168CCC 
mutated to GTT) and ΔVDRE-II (–289CACC mutated to AAAA). The 
ΔVDRE-II vector was then used as a template to produce the ΔVDRE-I + 
ΔVDRE-II (ΔVDREs) construct.
Primary culture of human hepatocytes. Hepatocytes were prepared from 
lobectomy segments resected from adult patients for medically required 
purposes unrelated to our research program. The use of these human 
hepatic specimens for scientific purposes has been approved by the French 
National Ethics Committee (Paris, France). Hepatocytes were prepared and 
cultured according to a previously published procedure (56). The cells were 
plated into collagen-coated dishes at 0.17 × 106 cells per square centimeter 
in a hormonally and chemically defined medium consisting of a mixture of 
Williams’s E medium and Ham’s F12 medium (1:1 in volume). Forty-eight 
hours after plating, cells were cultured in the presence of the indicated 
concentrations of compounds.
Quantitative PCR. Total RNA was extracted from cells or frozen mouse 
tissues using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen Corp.), according to the man￾ufacturer’s instructions. Purity was confirmed by spectrophotometry. 
cDNAs were synthesized from 1–2 μg of total RNA using the SuperScript 
II first-strand synthesis system for PCR (Invitrogen Corp.) at 42°C for 
60 minutes, in the presence of random hexamers (Amersham Pharmacia 
Biotech). Quantification of mRNAs was performed using the LightCy￾cler apparatus (Roche Diagnostics Corp.). Two microliters of diluted RT 
reaction (1:10) was used for real-time PCR amplification. The following 
program was used: a denaturation step at 95°C for 8 minutes, and 50 
cycles of PCR (denaturation, 95°C, 15 seconds; annealing, 67°C, 10 sec￾onds; extension, 72°C, 20 seconds). In all cases, the quality of the PCR 
product was assessed by monitoring of a fusion step at the end of the run. 
Mouse sense and reverse primers, respectively, were as follows: cyp24a1, 
5′-CTCCCTATGGATGCAGTATGTATAGTG and 5′-TTTAAAAACGTT￾GTCAGTAGGTCATAACT; cyp3a11, 5′-GAAGGAAAGCCGCCTGGATT 
and 5′-GGGTGAGTGGCCAAGGAATG; cyclophilin, 5′-TGGAGAGCAC￾CAAGACAGACA and 5′-TGCCGGAGTCGACAATGAT. Human sense and 
reverse primers, respectively, were as follows: CYP3A4, 5′-CACAAACCG￾GAGGCCTTTTG and 5′-ATCCATGCTGTAGGCCCCAA; GAPDH, 
5′-GGTCGGAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCG and 5′-CAAAGTTGTCATG￾GATGACC; CYP24 (NM_000782), 5′-GTGGCTCCAGCCAGACCCTA 
and 5′-GGCGAGGTTGGTACGAGGTG; CYP27B (NM_000785), 5′-
CGAGAAGGACCTGGAGTCTG and 5′-TCTGGGACACGAGAATTTCC; 
CYP27A (NM_000784), 5′-GCTTCCTCTTCCCCAAGAAC and 5′-ACTG￾CAGGCCCACTTTCTTA; VDR (NM_000376), 5′-AGCAGCGCATCATT￾GCCATA and 5′-CAGCATGGAGAGCTGGGACA. Human and mouse 
CYP24, CYP2R1, CYP27B, CYP27A, and VDR mRNA amplified fragments 
were purified using the NucleoSpin extract kit (Macherey-Nagel Co.) and 
verified by sequencing.
25(OH)D3 24-hydroxylase assay. Human hepatocytes plated in collagen￾coated dishes were treated for 72 hours with 50 nM 1,25(OH)2D3, 20 μM 
rifampicin, or 500 μM phenobarbital. After rinsing with medium, 1.6 nM 
3H-25(OH)D3 (0.05 μCi) were added, and the cells were incubated for an 
additional 4 hours in 1 ml medium. The medium was removed and the 
3H-vitamin D3 derivatives present in the medium were extracted by addi￾tion of 2 ml methanol plus 2 ml chloroform. The chloroform extract was 
cochromatographed with 100 ng unlabeled 24,25(OH)2D3 using a straight￾phase HPLC system (Beckman Coulter Inc.) equipped with a 4.6 × 250 mm 
Ultrasphere Si column (Altex; Beckman Coulter Inc.), and equilibrated with 
n-hexane and isopropanol (95:5) (flow rate 1.5 ml/min). Absorbance at 254 
nm was continually monitored, and effluent fractions were collected every 
minute. After evaporation to dryness, fractions were dissolved in Ultima 
Gold scintillation fluid (Packard Instrument Co.), and the radioactivity 
was measured. The 24-hydroxylase enzyme activity (femtomoles per cul￾ture well per 240 minutes) was calculated based on the percentage of the

Proposed model for PXR-mediated drug-induced osteopenia or osteo￾malacia. While 1α,25(OH)2D3 maintains vitamin D homeostasis via 
downregulation of vitamin D3 biosynthesis enzymes (CYP27B) and 
upregulation of the vitamin D–inactivating enzyme (CYP24), drugs 
that activate PXR may be responsible for the acceleration of vitamin 
D catabolism through the upregulation of CYP24, leading to vitamin D 
deficiency and eventually to osteopenia or osteomalacia.

injected radioactivity recovered in the 24,25(OH)2D3 regions after HPLC. 
The data were subjected to an overall statistical evaluation using ANOVA. 
Test groups were compared with respective untreated control groups using 
the Mann-Whitney nonparametric U test.
Animals and treatments. Male mice (C57BL/6; Charles River Laboratories 
France) were housed in a pathogen-free animal facility under a standard 
cycle of 12 hours light, 12 hours dark. After 1 week of acclimatization, preg￾nenolone 16α-carbonitrile (100 mg/kg/d) or dexamethasone (10 mg/kg/d) 
was injected in corn oil plus 5% DMSO through 6 successive daily admin￾istrations (n = 5 for each group). The mice were killed 4 hours after the 
last pregnenolone 16α-carbonitrile administration, and plasma and tissues 
(liver and kidney) were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Measurements of vitamin D metabolites in mouse plasma. The 25(OH)D3
metabolite was extracted from 50-μl plasma samples (n = 5) with metha￾nol-chloroform, and chromatographed on Amprep C18 Mini-Columns 
(RPN1900; Amersham Biosciences Europe GmbH) to separate 25(OH)D3
from vitamin D (57). The 24,25(OH)2D3 metabolite was extracted from 
300-μl plasma samples (pool of 1–2 mice, n = 3) with methanol-chloroform, 
and chromatographed on a straight-phase HPLC system (Beckman Coulter 
Inc.) using 92% n-hexane and 8% isopropanol as solvents. The 25(OH)D3
region from Amprep C18 chromatography and the 24,25(OH)2D3 region 
from HPLC were dried down and dissolved in ethanol. They were then 
assayed by the competitive protein-binding assay of Preece et al. (58), with 
2 modifications: serum vitamin D–binding protein was obtained from 
vitamin D–fed and not from vitamin D–deficient rats, and gelatin (3 g/l) 
was used instead of albumin. The quality of the results was controlled by 
simultaneous assessment of external standards (Vitamin D External Qual￾ity Assessment Scheme [DEQAS]).
Cell culture and transfections. Hek293 cells (human embryonic kidney 
cells) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and 
maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 μg/ml penicillin, 
and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen Corp.). Transfection of plasmid 
DNA was performed in single batches with FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics 
Corp.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For reporter analysis, 
transfections were performed using 80,000 cells, 150 ng of luciferase-based 
reporter plasmids, and expression plasmids for mouse PXR (50 ng of pSG5-
mPXR.1), human PXR (50 ng of pSG5-ΔATG-hPXR), or human VDR (25 ng 
of pSG5-hVDR). As internal control, 50 ng of pRSV-β-gal (Promega Corp.) 
was added. After 12–16 hours, the medium was changed, and fresh medi￾um containing 5% delipidated charcoal-stripped serum (Sigma-Aldrich) 
and 0.1% DMSO (vehicle) or inducers was added. Twenty-four hours after 
the medium was changed, the cells were harvested in reporter lysis buffer 
(Promega Corp.), and cell extracts were analyzed for luciferase and β-gal 
activities as described previously (8). Luciferase values were normalized 
with β-gal values calculated by division of the maximal response by the 
response elicited with vehicle.
Stable Hek293 clones expressing human PXR (Hek293-hPXR) were 
obtained by transfection of Hek293 cells with pIRES-hPXR/neo and, after 
3 weeks of selection, with 600 μg/ml G418. Individual clones were then 
amplified and analyzed for PXR mRNA and protein expression levels.
Western blot analysis. Whole-cell lysates (106 cells) were prepared from 
Hek293 or stable transfectant Hek293-hPXR cell lines, with 300 μl of 100 mM 
Tris (pH 8.5), 250 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, and anti￾protease tablet from Roche Diagnostics Corp. Following centrifugation 
(12,000 g for 10 minutes at 4°C), the supernatant was collected and stored at 
–80°C. Protein content was determined by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein 
assay (Interchim). Fifty-microgram extracts were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE 
and transferred to PROTRAN nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell 
BioScience Inc.). Immunoblotting was carried out with actin antibody (I-19) 
and PXR antibody (N-16), both purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology 
Inc. Chemiluminescence detection was performed using HRP-conjugated sec￾ondary antibodies and the Amersham Biosciences Europe GmbH ECL kit.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Double-stranded oligonucleotides cor￾responding to the 2 VDREs and site 3 of human CYP24 were synthesized 
(Invitrogen Corp.): VDRE-I (–174 to –151), CCGGACGCCCTCGCT￾CACCTCGCTGA; VDRE-II (–294 to –274), CGAAGCACACCCGGT￾GAACTCCGG; site 3 (–316 to –291), GGAGGGCGGGGAGGCGCGTTC￾GAAG. The CYP3A4 ER6 probe and binding procedure have previously 
been described (8). Probes were end-labeled with 32P-ATP using T4 poly￾nucleotide kinase (Promega Corp.) and then incubated for 20 minutes at 
room temperature with 1 μl of in vitro–synthesized PXR, VDR, or RXRα
(transcription and translation–coupled [TNT-coupled] transcriptional 
translation; Promega Corp.). DNA-protein complexes were subjected to 
electrophoresis on a 4% polyacrylamide gel (30:1 acrylamide/bis-acryl￾amide) in 0.5× TBE (1× TBE = 89 mM Tris, 89 mM boric acid, 2 mM 
EDTA). Gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography with XAR film 
(Eastman Kodak Co. Scientific Imaging Systems).
