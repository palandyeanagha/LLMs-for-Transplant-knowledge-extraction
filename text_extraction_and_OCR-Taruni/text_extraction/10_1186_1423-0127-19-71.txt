Abstract
Background: Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria have been implicated in the pathology of renal
ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). In the present study, we investigated whether the use of ischemic postconditioning
(IPostC) and trimetazidine (TMZ) separately or combined could reduce ER stress and mitochondria damage after
renal ischemia.
Methods: Kidneys of Wistar rats were subjected to 60-min of warm ischemia followed by 120-min of reperfusion
(I/R group, n = 6), or to 6 cycles of ischemia/reperfusion (10-s each cycle) just after 60-min of warm ischemia
(IPostC group, n = 6), or to i.p. injection of TMZ (3 mg/kg) 30-min before ischemia (TMZ group, n = 6), or to the
combination of both treatments (IPostC+TMZ group, n = 6). The results of these experimental groups were
compared to those of a sham-operated group in which rat renal pedicles were only dissected. Sodium reabsorption
rate, creatinine clearance lactate deshydrogenase (LDH) activity in plasma, and concentration of malonedialdehyde
(MDA) in tissue were determined. In addition, Western blot analysis was performed to identify the amounts of
cytochrome c, c-JunNH2-terminal kinase (JNK), voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), glycogen synthase kinase
3-beta (GSK3-β), and ER stress parameters.
Results: IPostC or/and TMZ significantly decreased cytolysis, oxidative stress and improved renal function in
comparison to I/R group. IPostC but not TMZ significantly attenuated ER stress parameters versus I/R group. Indeed,
it down-regulated the glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), the activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), the RNA
activated protein kinase (PKR)-like ER kinas (PERK), the X box binding protein-1 (XBP-1) and the caspase12 protein
levels. TMZ treatment significantly augmented GSK3-β phosphorylation and reduced levels of cytochrome c and
VDAC phosphorylation in comparison to IPostC application. The combination of both treatments gave a synergetic
effect. It significantly improved the survival rate, attenuated cytolysis, oxidative stress and improved renal function.
Conclusion: This study revealed that IPostC protects kidney from I/R injury by suppressing ER stress while the
beneficial effects of TMZ are mediated by mitochondria protection. The combination of both treatments
ameliorated functional recovery.

Background
Kidney ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury, which occurs
during renal surgery or transplantation, is the major
cause of acute renal failure (ARF) [1]. Rapid re￾establishment of blood flow is the best way to salvage
organ after ischemic injury, but it may also cause reper￾fusion damage. Growing bodies of research currently
concern the possibility of boosting innate protective
mechanisms rendering an organ resistant to subsequent
injury. For example, ischemic preconditioning (IPC) has
been shown to confer protection against a subsequent
ischemic attack [2]. IPC is an adaptive response in which
brief episodes of ischemia with intermittent reperfusion
given immediately before the onset of a more sustained
warm ischemia attenuates the pathophysiological effect
of I/R injury. In the kidney, IPC has been found to di￾minish post-ischemic damage [3]. However, a more effi￾cient approach is to intervene at the onset of reperfusion,
the timing of which is under the control of the operator.
Some results suggest that the first minutes of reperfusion
are determinant for defining the final outcome of the kid￾ney after ischemia [1]. In addition, it has been reported
that gradual increase of the blood flow to the ischemic
kidney could decrease ischemic changes [4]. Therefore,
the clinical limitations of IPC have led to the emergence
of a new concept i.e. ischemic postconditioning (IPostC),
defined as brief intermittent cycles of ischemia alternat￾ing with reperfusion applied after the ischemic event.
Ischemic postconditioning is an easy and safe ap￾proach, which provides protection against I/R injury in
heart [5], brain [6], liver [7] and kidney [1,4]. It has been
reported that IPostC can reduce cellular apoptosis [8], at￾tenuate renal dysfunction [1], decrease pro-inflammatory
cytokine release after renal I/R [4] and improve kidney
graft function [9]. However, the cellular mechanisms
underlying the IPostC-induced renal protection against
I/R injury remain unclear and considerable research is
required for understanding its molecular mechanisms.
More recently it has been reported that IPostC protects
brain and heart from I/R injury by attenuating endoplas￾mic reticulum (ER) stress [6,10].
Several studies evidenced the pivotal role of ER stress
as a major contributor able to increase the apoptosis and
exacerbate cell damage after I/R [11,12]. The ER is a
principal site for protein synthesis and folding, calcium
(Ca2+) storage, and signaling. Alterations in the ER en￾vironment as occur during renal I/R lead to the perturb￾ation of Ca2+ homeostasis and the accumulation of
misfolded proteins [13]. These disorders induce ER
stress and in turn activate a well-conserved adaptive re￾sponse, collectively referred to as unfolded protein re￾sponse (UPR) [14]. The UPR initially reduces the
amount of native proteins and increases the ability of
maturation of proteins in the ER. However, when ER
stress is intense or prolonged and adaptation mechan￾isms are overwhelmed, the cells trigger an apoptotic
death program [14-16]. The three main mediators
involved in the signaling pathway of the ER stress are
ATF6 (activated transcription factor 6), IRE1 (inositol re￾quiring enzyme 1) and PERK (protein kinase RNA
(PKR)-like ER kinase). Under physiological conditions,
these mediators are inactivated by binding to GRP78 in
the ER membrane. Initiation of UPR needs their release
from GRP78, allowing them to either dimerize or move
to other locations within the cell [16].
It became clear that pharmacological agents could also
impart protection when administered prior to the onset
of a sustained ischemia. Trimetazidine (TMZ), a well￾known anti ischemic drug, protects heart [17] and liver
[18] against I/R through the activation of intracellular
signaling pathways similar to those induced by the IPC.
It has also been reported that TMZ protects kidney
against the deleterious effects of warm ischemia [19] and
reduces the risk of ARF after kidney surgery [20,21]. Be￾sides its metabolic effects, TMZ has been demonstrated
to limit oxygen consumption during ischemia, acidosis,
intracellular accumulation of sodium and calcium, and
thereby maintain the cellular homeostasis [22,23].
The kidney protection conferred by both IPostC and
TMZ through suppression of ER stress remains to be
defined. The goals of the present study were: (1) to
compare the effectiveness of two protective strategies
namely IPostC and TMZ when used separately or in
combination (2) and to show whether the renal protec￾tion conferred by IPostC and TMZ involves suppres￾sion of ER stress and mitochondrial impairment in I/R
kidney.
Methods
Surgical procedure
Male Wistar rats (200–250 g) were anesthetized by keta￾mine (50 mg/Kg, i.p.) and allowed to breathe spontan￾eously. This study respected the European Union
regulations (Directive 86/609/CEE) for animal experi￾ments. After maintaining the core body temperature at
37°C, a midline laparatomy was performed, and both left
and right renal arteries and veins were exposed. In order
to evaluate kidney function, catheters were inserted into
i. the jugular vein to perfuse (Minipuls 3 peristaltic pump,
Gilson, France) heated (37°C) mannitol (10%) and heparin
(50 U/I); ii. the carotid artery to measure arterial pressure
(Pression Monitor BP-1; Pression Instruments, Sarasota,
FL) and to collect blood samples collection ; iii. the blad￾der to collect urine samples. To induce renal ischemia the
renal pedicles were occluded with non traumatic vascular
clamps. Reperfusion was initiated by removal of the
clamps.

Experimental protocol
Rats were randomly divided into 5 experimental groups
(n = 6 for each group, Figure 1):
– Sham-operated control group: kidney pedicles were
only dissected off the surrounding perirenal fat;
– Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) group: both renal
pedicles were clamped for 60 min and then
subjected to 120 min of reperfusion;
– Ischemic postconditioning (IPostC) group: as I/R
group but kidneys were subjected to 6 cycles of 10-s
of reperfusion and 10-s re-occlusion immediately
after the 60-min of ischemia;
– Trimetazidine (TMZ) group: as I/R group but rats
were treated with 3 mg/Kg (i.p.injection) of TMZ
30-min before warm ischemia;
– TMZ+IPostC group: 30-min after TMZ injection
(3 mg/Kg, i.p.), renal pedicles were clamped for
60-min and then IPostC (6 cycles of 10 sec I/R)
was applied.
Survival rates
Another 30 rats were randomly divided into 5 groups for
observation of survival rates during 10 days after reperfu￾sion. After reperfusion, the animals were returned to their
cages and were allowed for food and water as needed.
Renal function study
Blood and urine samples were collected to assess creatin￾ine and sodium concentration. Creatinine concentrations
in plasma and urine were measured according to the
Jaffe’s reaction (BioMerieux Kit, France). Sodium concen￾trations in plasma and urine were evaluated by a flame
photometer (BT.634, Biotecnica instruments, Italy).
Renal glomerular function was assessed by creatinine
clearance. The formula to calculate the creatinine clear￾ance (μl/min/g BW) was: Creat ð Þ u:V =Creatp
Creatp: Creatinine concentration in plasma (μmol/l).
Creatu: Creatinine concentration in urine (μmol/l).
V: Urine flow (μl/min).

injection 30-min before ischemia). Sham, sham-operated rats; I/R, rats were subjected to bilateral renal ischemia (60 min) followed by reperfusion
(120 min).

Nau: Sodium concentration in urine (mmol/l).
Nap: Sodium concentration in plasma (mmol/l).

Lipid peroxydation assessment
Lipid peroxydation, used as an indirect index of the oxi￾dative injury induced by the reactive oxygen species, was
determined by measuring the formation of MDA with
the thiobarbiturate reaction [24].
Histological examination
To appraise the severity of kidney injury, tissues sections
were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and evaluated
by an experienced pathologist who was unaware of the
treatment. A grading scale of 0–4, as outlined by
Jablonski et al., was used for the histopathologic assess￾ment of kidney damage [25].
Western blot analysis
The kidney tissue was homogenized in ice cold lysis buf￾fer (containing 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH
7.5), 1 mM DTT, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM
EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM orthovanadate, 0.05%
Triton-X 100 and 2% protease inhibitor cocktails) using a
Teflon homogenizer. After that, the homogenates were
centrifuged at 15000 rpm for 20 min at 4°C. The superna￾tants were collected to determinate protein concentrations
by the Bradford assay. Proteins were then separated by
SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and transferred into polyvinyl￾dene fluoride membranes. Membranes were immuno￾blotted with antibodies directed against GRP78, XBP-1,
total and phospho-PERK and ATF4 (Santa Cruz Biotech￾nology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA), caspase 12, cytochrome c,
total and p-GSK3-β, total and p-VDAC and total and
phospho-JNK (Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Beverly,
MA, USA) and β actin (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO).
The bands were visualized using an enhanced chemilu￾minescence kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA,
USA). The values were obtained by densitometric scan￾ning and the quantity one software program (Bio-Rad La￾boratories, Hercules, CA, USA).
Statistical analysis
All data were expressed as mean values ± SEM (n = 6 for
each group). The one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
test was used for comparison of group data. If the
ANOVA was significant, multiple comparisons were
carried out using the Newman-Keuls test. Statistical sig￾nificance was defined as P <0.05. Survival curves were
constructed using the khi 2 test differences between the
four groups were analyzed by the log-rank test. A P value
<0.05 was considered a statistical significance.
Results
Effects of the application of IPostC and ipTMZ treatments
separately
IPostC and TMZ treatments improved survival rates
when compared to I/R group. We found respectively
83% and 67% in IPostC and TMZ groups versus 33% in
I/R group. Sham-operated rats showed no mortality
(survival rate was 100%).
Renal I/R resulted in a significant (P <0.05) increase in
plasma LDH activity (1054 ± 28 U/L, Figure 2A) and tis￾sue MDA concentration (0.62 ± 0.02 nmol/mg prot,
Figure 2B) compared to sham group (441 ± 18 U/L for
LDH activity and 0.15 ± 0.01 nmol/mg prot for MDA
concentration). The use of IPostC or TMZ treatments
significantly improved cells integrity and reduced lipid
peroxidation when compared to I/R group. Indeed after
IPostC application, we observed 888 ± 23 U/L for LDH
activity and 0.33 ± 0.03 nmol/mg prot for MDA concen￾tration (P <0.05 vs I/R group, respectively). After i.p. in￾jection of TMZ, we found that LDH activity decreased
to 864 ± 14 U/L and tissue MDA concentration reached
0.31 ± 0.02 nmol/mg prot P <0.05 vs I/R group, respect￾ively. There is no statistical difference between TMZ
and IPostC groups.
Kidney function parameters (Figure 3) of rats sub￾jected to I/R were also significantly different from those
of sham-operated group. Indeed, I/R decreased renal
creatinine clearance (0.27 ± 0.09 vs 4.66 ± 0.4 μL/min/g
BW, for I/R and sham groups respectively, P <0.05) and
sodium reabsorption rate (70.4 ± 6.0 vs 99.7 ± 0.02%, for
I/R and sham groups respectively, P <0.05). Both IPostC
and TMZ treatments significantly improved function
parameters of the ischemic kidneys. When IPostC and
TMZ were applied, we found respectively 0.78 ± 0.06 and
0.85 ± 0.09 μL/min/g BW for creatinine clearance
(P <0.05 vs I/R group, respectively) and 96.8 ± 0.3% and
96.4 ± 0.3% for the sodium reabsorption rate (P <0.05 vs
I/R group, respectively). There is no statistical difference
between IPostC and TMZ groups for both parameters.
Renal I/R caused severe architectural disruption, in￾cluding tubular necrosis, medullary hemorrhage, conges￾tion and development of proteinaceous casts (Figure 4C
and 4D). According to Jablonski scores (Figure 5),
60 min renal ischemia followed by 120 min reperfusion
resulted in severe kidney injury. In contrast, IPostC
(Figure 4E and 4F) and TMZ (Figure 4G and 4H) pre￾served the morphologic integrity of tubular structure
and tubular brush border with less evidence of acute

tubular necrosis and less casts formation. Quantitative
analysis (Figure 5) showed a decreased score in IPostC
and TMZ groups compared with I/R group (P <0.05,
respectively).
We also considered ER stress. As indicated in Figure 6,
our results showed a significant (P <0.05) enhance in
GRP78, p-PERK, ATF4 and XBP-1 protein levels after I/R
in comparison to sham-operated group, which denotes ER
stress. The IPostC application before reperfusion of
ischemic kidneys significantly reduced GRP78 level
(228 ± 13 vs 376 ± 18 for IPostC and I/R groups respect￾ively, P <0.05). Similarly, this treatment significantly
declined the relative amounts of p-PERK (53 ± 5 vs 89 ± 6,
P <0.05), ATF4 (42 ± 11 vs 105 ± 12, P <0.05) and XBP-1
(231 ± 16 vs 423 ± 19, P <0.05) compared to I/R, respect￾ively. Interestingly, no statistical differences were obtained
between sham and IPostC groups for all these parameters,
except for XBP-1. In contrast, i.p. injection of TMZ before

warm ischemia did not improved ER stress parameters
versus I/R group which remained high compared to sham
group (P <0.05).
Considering the potential relationship between GSK3−β
and mitochondrial VDAC, we evaluated whether changes
in GSK3-β activity induced by ischemic injury could be
associated with changes in mitochondrial VDAC activity
(Figure 7). The Western blot analysis of ischemic kidneys
revealed a decline of GSK3-β phosphorylation (34 ± 4 vs
54 ± 4, P <0.05) and an increase of VDAC phosphorylation
(195 ± 6 vs 27 ± 2, P <0.05) in comparison to sham, re￾spectively. Of the two treatments used, TMZ affected
more p-GSK3-β and p-VDAC. Indeed, we found 109 ± 7
and 104 ± 2 for respectively p-GSK3-β and p-VDAC in the

increase in protein levels of caspase 12 (245 ± 38 vs 52 ± 1,
P <0.05), p-JNK (163 ± 28 vs 32 ± 1, P <0.05) and cyto￾chrome c (232 ± 31 vs 74 ± 23, P <0.05). Both treatments
induced distinct results on the apoptosis parameters. In￾deed in comparison to I/R, IPostC application attenuated
caspase 12 and p-JNK (54 ± 1, P <0.05 and 39 ± 1, P <0.05
respectively) whereas TMZ injection declined only cyto￾chrome c release (49 ± 1, P <0.05 vs I/R group).
Effects of the combination of TMZ and IPostC treatments
Rats treated with TMZ+IPostC had significantly (P <0.05)
prolonged survival rate (100%) compared with those in
I/R (33%), IPostC (83%) and TMZ (67%). In addition,
combination of TMZ and IPostC treatments improved
cells integrity and reduced lipid peroxidation when com￾pared to each treatment separately. Indeed, LDH activity
and tissue MDA concentration reached 753 ± 16 U/L and
0.21 ± 0.01 nmol/mg prot, respectively (P <0.05 vs TMZ
and IPostC groups, respectively). Parallely, creatinine
clearance of the kidneys was also increased. We found
1.82 ± 0.1 μL/min/g BW, it was significantly (P <0.05)
improved when compared to TMZ and IPostC groups, re￾spectively. The combination of these two treatments pre￾served the morphologic integrity of tubular structure
(Figure 4I and 4J). Quantitative analysis showed a further
synergistic effect in decreasing Jablonski scores as com￾pared to each treatment alone (P <0.05 versus IPostC and
TMZ respectively).
Concerning mitochondrial and apoptosis parameters,
the beneficial effects were maintained when both treat￾ments were combined. In fact, we found 125 ± 7 and
80 ± 3 respectively for GSK3-β and VDAC (P <0.05 vs
IPostC group, respectively). However, these improve￾ments were not observed regarding all ER stress para￾meters; expect the XBP-1 factor.
Discussion
Blood flow restoration next an anoxic or hypoxic period
alters the function of numerous organs, such as the
heart [2], brain [6], liver [18] and kidney [4]. This event
induces abnormal activation of many signal transduction
cascades, which lead to cellular dysfunction and initi￾ation of the apoptosis/necrosis. In agreement with previ￾ous studies [3,26], our results confirmed that renal I/R
provokes severe glomerular and tubular damage. Exces￾sive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) plays a
principal role leading to structural and functional injury
of the ischemic kidneys [27].
The understanding of renal I/R syndrome is still in￾complete although several mechanisms were henceforth
defined. Some recent evidences strongly suggest the in￾volvement of ER stress as an initiator of cell death dur￾ing ischemic glomerular and tubular epithelial injury
[28,29]. The ER provides an optimized environment for
formation and maturation of cell proteins, but several
insults can interfere with this machinery causing aber￾rant protein folding. Accumulation of these unfolded or
misfolded proteins in the ER lumen induces ER stress
and in turn activates a well-conserved adaptive response.
The present study shows that the ER stress is enhanced
in kidney following I/R. We observed increased amount of
the ER chaperone GRP78, which is a central regulator of
ER function. This expression was associated with amplified
levels of p-PERK, ATF4 and XBP-1. In addition, apoptosis
is induced given that caspase 12 and p-JNK, the hallmarks
of ER associated apoptosis, and cytochrome c were found
to be over-expressed in ischemic kidney. Other studies have
also produced evidence suggesting ER stress following
in vivo renal I/R. I/R induces phosphorylation of PERK and
eIF2α, indicating ER stress and activation of the UPR
[28,30,31]. It has been observed that I/R of rat kidneys aug￾mented expression of the ER molecular stress chaperone
GRP78, as well as TUNEL labeling and the apoptotic pro￾tein caspase 12. These increases are concomitant with oxi￾dative stress [29]. In their study, Wang et al. have
established that one of the downstream pathways of apop￾totic cell death after ER stress is mediated by JNK [32].
They found that JNK is translocated to the mitochondrial
membrane, and in turn it is decisive for cytochrome c re￾lease. Furthermore, the increased level of p-PERK after I/R
injury seems to play a significant pro-apoptotic role, as it
induces the activation of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding

protein homologous protein (CHOP) [31]. Gao et al.
showed that taurousodeoxycholic acid (TDUCA), an in￾hibitor of ER stress, could represent effective strategy to
improve renal function and to reduce apoptosis of tubular
epithelial cells. These beneficial effects were associated with
a reduction of GRP78, CHOP and caspase 12 [33]. Taken
together, these data and our results suggest that I/R￾induced oxidative injury activates ER stress and conse￾quently leads to damage cells of rat kidneys. However, it is
unclear how ROS induce ER stress. One possibility is that
ROS cause inhibition of Ca2+-ATPase on the ER mem￾brane and thus depletion of Ca2+ stores in this organelle
[13,34,35]. Another possibility is that ROS may cause gen￾eration and accumulation of oxidatively modified and ab￾normal proteins in the ER [36].
The detrimental effects of renal I/R injury are now
well recognized. Interestingly, IPostC has been shown to
protect multiple organs [5-7] including kidney [8] from
I/ R injury. Chen et al. reported that IPostC application
attenuated renal dysfunction [4]. In agreement with this
our results clearly indicate an improvement of creatinine
clearance and Na reabsorption rate in the treated kid￾neys versus those none treated. Parallely, IPostC
enhances cell integrity and decreases lipid peroxydation

as compared to I/R group. Eldaif et al. demonstrated
that IPostC could stabilize the structure of the tubular
epithelial cells [9]. However, the cellular mechanism
remains to be defined. Our results show a marked de￾cline in the levels of GRP78, p-PERK, ATF4, and XBP-1
in IPostC group. Concomitantly, we note that IPostC
reduces the phosphorylation of the JNK and the caspase
12 level in ischemic kidneys. Yeh et al. observed that
renal hypoxic conditioning attenuated oxidative stress,
and diminished GRP78 and caspase 12 in the ischemic
renal tubules. These effects are correlated with enhanced
HSP70 protein expression and hypoxia-inducible tran￾scription factor-1α (HIF-1α) activation [29]. In their

induced ER stress in the heart via the mobilization of
the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK)/
JNK signaling pathways [10]. Moreover, Yuan et al. sug￾gested in their study that IPostC protected ischemic
brain through suppressing ER stress-induced apoptosis
and that PI3K/Akt pathway was involved [6]. Therefore
we could suggest that IPostC could protect kidneys
against renal I/R insults throughout modulation of ER
stress.
There is accumulating evidence that lethal reperfusion
injury could be reduced by TMZ preconditioning in ani￾mals. It was found that TMZ conserves ATP production
and lowers intracellular acidosis, while maintaining cel￾lular homeostasis [19-21,37]. In addition, it reduces oxi￾dative damage to the mitochondria and protects the
organ from I/R-induced damage arising from mitochon￾drial respiration [22,38,39]. When given before ischemia,
TMZ attenuates the inflammatory response and the
tubulointerstitial development of fibrosis prevalent in is￾chemic kidney injury and reduces the rate of apoptosis
expression [19,22]. These effects were correlated with an
early and great expression of HIF-1α. The same impact
was also found in liver [18]. In another study, the pro￾tective effect appeared to be through activation of p38
MAPK and Akt signaling [17]. However, there is no data
about the impact of TMZ treatment on ER stress pro￾cesses after I/R. Here, we found that contrary to IPostC
treatment, it seems that reduction of ER stress is not
involved in the protective mechanism of TMZ of ische￾mic kidney, at least at the early period of reperfusion. As
observed, all levels of the ER stress parameters (GRP78,
p-PERK, ATF4, XBP-1 and caspase 12) were decreased
but not significantly as compared with those of I/R
group. However, we noted a significant decrease of mito￾chondrial parameters (p-VDAC and cytochrome c) and a
significant increase in p-GSK3-β content in TMZ group
versus I/R group.
TMZ as mostly described, acts on mitochondria by re￾storing ATP synthesis and by maintaining the mitochon￾drial membrane impermeability [40]. Indeed, TMZ might
bind to inner mitochondrial membrane [41] to modulate
the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP)
opening [19]. Moreover, TMZ might interact with VDAC
which has been also proposed to control the release of
cytochrome c without mPTP opening [41]. Parallely, pre￾vious studies demonstrated that inhibition of GSK3-β
phosphorylation was associated with a decrease in VDAC
phosphorylation and a delayed mPTP opening [19,42,43].
Overall, the data from the present study suggest that
ER might not be a target through which TMZ exerts its
cytoprotective effect at early reperfusion and that TMZ
beneficial effect attenuated essentially mitochondrial
dysfunction after renal I/R. In agreement with this, our
results show that TMZ protected mitochondria from
deleterious consequences of renal I/R injury, via promo￾tion of GSK3-β phosphorylation and prevention of
VDAC phosphorylation.
We also evaluated the effect of the combination of both
TMZ and IPostC treatments on renal function. Interest￾ingly, we noted a significant improvement of the renal
functional parameters as shown by a rise of GFR and Na
reabsorption rate versus TMZ and IPostC separately. Such
result may be explicated, at least partially, by the improve￾ment of structural parameters. In fact, we observed a sig￾nificant decline of MDA level and LDH activity as
compared to each treatment alone. Histopathological as￾sessment confirmed our suggestion. Taken together, our
results supported the idea of a synergetic outcome of
both treatments to ameliorate kidney function following
warm I/R. The protective mechanisms of the association
TMZ+IPostC implicate distinct organelles. In fact, the
beneficial effects of TMZ triggered essentially mitochon￾drial disturbance, while IPostC reduced ER stress. We
noted, after the association of both treatments, a significant
decline in the rate of XBP-1 and caspase 12, as compared
to the TMZ group and I/R group. However, we noted a
paradoxical increase in the levels of the PERK and its
downstream factor (ATF4) in the group TMZ+IPostC, as
compared to IPostC only. These results may be explained,
by the fact that the combination TMZ+IPostC did not im￾plicate the PERK pathway and its downstream factor
(ATF4). Probably, the effect of IPostC on the PERK path￾way is lost, when it was combined to TMZ treatment. The
underlying mechanisms are not well understood and other
investigations are necessary to confirm this hypothesis.
Conclusions
I/R injury is a multifactorial process in which mitochon￾dria and ER take critical part. Consequently, treatments
that could act on these organelles represent interesting
preventive strategies. This study demonstrates that appli￾cation of IPostC after warm ischemia or i.p. injection of
TMZ before warm ischemia attenuates renal dysfunction
and renal morphologic disruptions during early reperfu￾sion. TMZ acts on mitochondria while the use of IPostC
seems to trigger mechanisms which are associated, with
