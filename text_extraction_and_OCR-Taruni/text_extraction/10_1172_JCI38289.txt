Massive liver resection and small-for-size liver transplantation pose a therapeutic challenge, due to increased
susceptibility ofthe remnant/graftto ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) and impaired regeneration. We investi￾gated the dual role of complementin IRI versus regeneration in mice.Complement component 3 (C3) deficiency
and complement inhibition with complement receptor 2–complement receptor 1–related protein y (CR2-Crry,
an inhibitor ofC3 activation) provided protection from hepatic IRI, and whileC3 deficiency also impaired liver
regeneration following partial hepatectomy (PHx), the effect of CR2-Crry in this context was dose dependent.
In a combined model of IRI and PHx, either C3 deficiency or high-dose CR2-Crry resulted in steatosis, severe
hepatic injury, and high mortality, whereas low-dose CR2-Crry was protective and actually increased hepatic
proliferative responses relative to control mice. Reconstitution experiments revealed an important role for the
C3a degradation product acylation-stimulating protein (ASP)in the balance between inflammation/injury ver￾sus regeneration. Furthermore, liver regeneration was dependent on the putative ASP receptor, C5L2. Several
potential mechanisms of hepatoprotectionand recovery were identified in mice treated with low-doseCR2-Crry,
including enhanced IL-6 expression and STAT3 activation, reduced hepatic ATP depletion, and attenuated oxi￾dative stress.These data indicate that a threshold of complement activation, involving ASP andC5L2, promotes
liver regeneration and suggest a balance between complement-dependent injury and regeneration.
Introduction
Liver resection has become an increasingly safe procedure, but cer￾tain procedures remain high risk, such as massive liver resection 
and small-for-size (SFS) liver transplantation (1–3). Massive hepatic 
resection is the only option for some patients with primary or sec￾ondary liver tumors. With regard to SFS transplantation, the use 
of partial liver grafts has the potential to substantially reduce the 
donor shortage by allowing the donor organ to be split between 2 
recipients. In addition, live donor liver transplantation is emerging 
as an option for some patients, a procedure requiring liver resection 
and regeneration in the donor and regeneration in the recipient.
The failure of a partial liver to regenerate is considered a critical 
contributing factor in postsurgical primary liver dysfunction and 
liver failure, and minimal viable liver volume required for regenera￾tion, following either massive liver resection or SFS transplanta￾tion, is an important concept (1–3). Impaired liver regeneration 
and liver dysfunction has been strongly linked to the extent of 
hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI), an unavoidable conse￾quence of the surgical procedures, and studies in rodent models 
have shown that small liver fragments and SFS grafts are more 
susceptible to IRI (3–7). Although the precise mechanisms respon￾sible for liver dysfunction and failure in small liver remnants and 
SFS grafts are not well understood, complement appears to play 
an important role in both IRI and liver regeneration.
Studies using rat models indicate a central role for comple￾ment in hepatic IRI. These studies have variously shown that 
complement inhibition with soluble complement receptor 1 
(sCR1) reduces Kupffer cell activation, neutrophil accumulation, 
and microvascular dysfunction and injury in rat liver (8–11). 
C1-inhibitor and C5a receptor antagonist have also been shown 
to be protective in rat models of hepatic IRI (9–11), and a role 
for the terminal cytolytic membrane attack complex (MAC) is 
indicated by a study showing that deficiency of complement 
component 6 (C6) (a component of the MAC) is associated with 
protection from injury, following hepatic IRI in rats (12).
In addition to its role in hepatic IRI, recent evidence indicates 
that complement activation is required for normal liver regenera￾tion, following either resection or toxic injury (13–17). Using a 
murine model of 70% partial hepatectomy (PHx), it was shown 
that C3- and C5-deficient mice exhibited impaired liver regen￾eration and high mortality after liver resection and that recon￾stitution of the complement-deficient mice with C3a or C5a 
improved the regenerative response (14). Data indicate that the 
complement activation products C3a and C5a play an important 
role in the proliferative response and hepatocyte regeneration 
via an effect on TNF-α and IL-6 expression and the subsequent 
expression of the transcription factors NF-κB and STAT3 (14).

C5aR signaling in liver regeneration has also been demonstrated 
in a mouse model of CCl4-induced liver toxicity (13, 15).
Thus, although the studies outlined above indicate that com￾plement inhibition represents a potential therapeutic strategy to 
protect against hepatic IRI, the important role of complement in 
liver regeneration would appear to be a contraindication for such 
a strategy in the context of liver resection and SFS liver transplan￾tation, even though IRI is associated with impaired regeneration. 
A better understanding of the complement-dependant mecha￾nisms and the relative contribution of complement in IRI versus 
regeneration as well as the relationship between hepatic IRI and 
regeneration, may therefore have substantial implications for 
the development of complement modulatory approaches aimed 
at improving outcome following massive liver resection or SFS 
liver transplantation. In the current study, we investigated the 
role of complement in the relationship between hepatic IRI and 
liver regeneration using 3 murine models: a warm total hepatic 
IRI model (similar to the Pringle maneuver), a 70% PHx model, 
and a combined IRI/PHx model designed to recreate clinical mas￾sive liver resection under the Pringle maneuver. In these studies, 
we used the complement inhibitor CR2–complement component 
(3b/4b) receptor 1-like (CR2-Crry), a recently described inhibitor 
of C3 activation that targets to sites of complement activation and 
provides effective local protection from complement without sig￾nificant systemic effects (18).
Results
Hepatic IRI.The role of complement in murine hepatic IRI was investi￾gated using C3–/– mice and in WT mice treated with different doses of 
the complement inhibitor CR2-Crry (either 0.08 mg or 0.25 mg). Fol￾lowing 30 minutes hepatic ischemia and either 6 hours or 24 hours 
of reperfusion, survival, liver injury, and local inflammation was 
assessed. All mice survived for the observed periods after reperfusion. 
Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were determined as a 
measure of liver function, and ALT levels were raised significantly 
in all groups undergoing I/R, compared with baseline or with sham￾operated mice (Figure 1A). However, ALT levels were significantly 
higher after reperfusion in WT mice following I/R, compared with 
C3–/– mice or mice treated with either dose of inhibitor. A 0.08-mg 
dose of CR2-Crry was less protective than a 0.25-mg dose at 6 hours 
after reperfusion, although ALT levels were not significantly differ￾ent at 24 hours after reperfusion. Histological assessment scores of 
injury were also significantly lower in C3–/– and complement-inhib￾ited mice at both 6 hours and 24 hours after I/R (Figure 1, B and C), 
with high-dose inhibition providing better protection at both time 
points of analysis. To assess the effect of complement activation

on neutrophil recruitment, myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels in liver 
homogenates were determined. Levels of MPO were elevated in all 
after reperfusion samples compared with baseline and sham-oper￾ated controls, but MPO levels were significantly lower in C3-deficient 
and complement-inhibited mice compared with control WT mice at 
both 6 hours and 24 hours after reperfusion (Figure 1D). MPO lev￾els were, however, higher at 24 hours compared with those 6 hours 
after reperfusion in all groups, which did not correlate with reduced 
ALT and injury scores at 24 hours compared with those 6 hours after 
reperfusion. Levels of the inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α and IL-6, 
were also significantly reduced in C3-deficient and complement￾inhibited mice compared with WT controls at both time points after 
reperfusion, with significantly lower levels at 24 hours compared with 
those 6 hours after reperfusion (Figure 1, E and F). An overall com￾parison of injury and recovery markers at 6 and 24 hours after I/R 
indicated that C3 deficiency and high-dose inhibition delays recov￾ery and repair compared with low-dose complement inhibition. For 
clinical relevance, we used a model of total hepatic ischemia, similar 
to the Pringle maneuver, a clinical procedure often used in hepatic 
surgery. Nevertheless, we have shown that complement deficiency 
and inhibition also protects against IRI in a model of partial hepatic 
ischemia that does not carry the risk of intestinal venous congestion, 
a condition that may activate complement and may cause endotox￾emia (Supplemental Figure 1; supplemental material available online 
with this article; doi:10.1172/JCI38289DS1).
PHx and liver regeneration. In broad agreement with previously 
published data (14), we demonstrated that C3 deficiency results 
in increased injury following 70% PHx, as measured by increased 
serum ALT, bilirubin, focal liver necrosis, and mortality. In addi￾tion, an impaired regenerative response in C3–/– mice was demon￾strated by significantly reduced BrdU incorporation, decreased 
mitotic index score, and reduced restitution of liver weight (Sup￾plemental Figure 2).
We also observed a significant increase in liver steatosis in C3–/–
mice after PHx compared with WT mice, as assessed by histologi￾cal examination and by triglyceride content. Liver regeneration is 
associated with transient accumulation of hepatic lipids, and mild 
macrovesicular steatosis developed in WT mice following PHx. How￾ever, C3 deficiency was associated with the development of moder￾ate-to-severe macrovesicular and microvesicular steatosis (Figure 2). 
It is not known whether there is a mechanistic link between comple￾ment, steatosis, and regeneration, but C3a has been shown to play an 
important role in liver regeneration (14), and its degraded form, C3a￾des-Arg (also known as acylation-stimulating protein [ASP]), plays 
a role in lipid metabolism. ASP increases fat storage in adipocytes 
through increased triglyceride synthesis and decreased intracellular 
lipolysis (19), and since mice deficient in C3 (and therefore unable to 
generate ASP) have delayed triglyceride clearance (20–22), we admin￾istered ASP to C3−/− mice following PHx to assess the effect of ASP on 
liver regeneration and steatosis. Reconstitution of C3–/– mice with 
a 15-μg dose of recombinant ASP significantly reduced steatosis 
and hepatic injury, completely restored the proliferative response as 
measured by BrdU incorporation and restitution of liver weight, and 
significantly improved survival (Figures 2 and 3). TNF-α and IL-6 are 
cytokines involved in the priming events of liver regeneration via their 
effects on NF-κB and STAT3 activation. Confirming previous data 
(14), C3 deficiency significantly reduced STAT3 activation following 
PHx (Figure 3F). However, reconstitution of C3–/– mice with 15 μg 
ASP restored STAT3 activation to WT levels, identifying a putative 
pathway through which ASP may modulate liver regeneration.
Although not without controversy, the only identified receptor for 
ASP is C5a-like receptor 2 (C5L2) (23–26), and C5L2 plays an impor￾tant role in triglyceride synthesis and clearance (25, 26). To investi￾gate a role for C5L2 in liver regeneration and a putative link between 
ASP and C5L2 in regeneration, we determined the effect of C5L2 
deficiency on liver injury and regeneration following PHx. C5L2–/–
mice responded to PHx similarly to C3–/– mice, and, compared with 
WT mice, displayed significantly increased hepatic injury, increased 
mortality, and impaired liver regeneration (Figure 3). C5L2–/– mice 
also developed moderate to severe hepatic steatosis following PHx 
(Figure 2). Also similar to that in C3–/– mice, STAT3 activation was 
significantly reduced in C5L2–/– mice following PHx compared with 
WT mice and ASP reconstituted mice. We further determined the 
effect of ASP administration to C5L2–/– mice following PHx. Treat￾Figure 2

ment of C5L2–/– mice with 15 μg ASP following PHx had no effect on 
any parameter of injury or regeneration in these mice (Figure 3, A–E) 
and did not effect STAT3 signaling (Figure 3F). Collectively, the data 
are consistent with the hypothesis that ASP modulates regeneration 
via a mechanism involving C5L2 modulation of STAT3 activation. 
Nevertheless, previous studies have indicated a key role for C5a and 
C5aR signaling in STAT3 activation and liver regeneration (14), and 
importantly, complement activation was similar in C5L2–/– and WT 
mice following PHx, as determined by C3 deposition in liver sections 
(Supplemental Figure 3).
Unexpectedly, reconstitution of C3–/– mice with a high dose of ASP 
(50 μg) following PHx failed to restore the regenerative response 
and did not protect against injury (Figure 3). It was not clear why 
low- versus high-dose ASP had opposing effects in liver regenera￾tion and injury in C3–/– mice following PHx. However, while the 
complement activation products C3a and C5a have been shown to 
play a key role in the priming stages of liver regeneration via their 
effect on TNF-α and IL-6 expression, these cytokines can play dual 
roles in hepatocyte regeneration and injury, and increased and pro￾longed expression of these inflammatory cytokines is associated 
with hepatic injury (27–29). We therefore investigated the effect of 
high- versus low-dose ASP on TNF-α and IL-6 expression levels and 
on hepatic neutrophil infiltration (MPO activity) following PHx. At 
6 hours after PHx, TNF-α and IL-6 levels were significantly elevated 
in C3–/– mice treated with either high- or low-dose ASP compared 
with saline-treated C3–/– mice (Figure 4). However, levels of both 
cytokines were significantly higher in mice treated with 50 μg ASP 
compared with those in mice treated with 15 μg ASP. High-dose ASP 
also correlated with significantly increased neutrophil infiltration 
after PHx, as determined by MPO activity. Thus, high-dose ASP is 
associated with a significantly higher inflammatory burden after 
PHx. We also determined that treatment of WT mice with either 
a low or high dose of ASP following PHx significantly (P < 0.05) 
increased injury and impaired the proliferative response, with the 
higher dose of ASP having a more profound effect on injury and 
regeneration (data not shown). Together, the above data indicate 
that ASP is a key factor in liver regeneration following PHx, but ASP, 
at levels higher than normally generated endogenously due to PHx￾induced complement activation results, in increased hepatic inflam￾mation and injury and an impaired regenerative response. These 
data suggest that there is a threshold of complement activation and 
C3a/ASP production for optimal liver regeneration following PHx.
Complement inhibition and liver regeneration.To put the above results 
in a more clinical context, we investigated the effect of different 
Figure 3
Reconstitution of C3–/– mice with ASP following PHx enhances either regeneration or injury depending on dose, and C5L2 (putative ASP recep￾tor) deficiency increases injury and impairs regeneration. A 15-μg or 50-μg dose of ASP was administered to C3–/– mice and a 15-μg dose of ASP 
was administered to C5L2–/– mice immediately after surgery, and all determinations were made at 48 hours after PHx. (A) Serum ALT levels.

compared with WT mice. A 15-μg dose of ASP restored activation of STAT3 in C3–/– mice but not C5L2–/– mice. #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01 versus the

doses of a complement inhibitor on liver injury and regeneration 
following PHx in WT mice. For these studies, we used CR2-Crry at 
a dose of 0.08 mg or 0.25 mg, the same doses used in the above IRI 
studies. Similar to the results with C3–/– mice (shown in Supple￾mental Figure 2), WT mice treated with a 0.25-mg dose of CR2-Crry 
after PHx showed significantly increased liver injury and impaired 
proliferative response compared with saline-treated controls (Figure 
5). There was also a high mortality of these complement-inhibited 
mice compared with saline-treated controls (40% versus 0%, respec￾tively, monitored over a 7-day period). As might be expected given 
the important role for complement activation in liver regeneration, 
the lower dose of CR2-Crry resulted in less injury and increased 
BrdU incorporation compared with high-dose CR2-Crry treatment. 
Unexpectedly, however, low-dose complement inhibition resulted in 
significantly less hepatic injury and a significantly enhanced prolif￾erative response compared with saline-treated controls (Figure 5). 
Additional data demonstrated that low-dose CR2-Crry treatment 
resulted in improved and accelerated regeneration at multiple time 
points after PHx. By 7 days after PHx, restoration of liver to normal 
weight was almost complete, and there was no significant difference 
between mice treated with saline or low-dose CR2-Crry (Supplemen￾tal Figure 4, A and B). There was no mortality in mice treated with 
0.08 mg of CR2-Crry or saline, but there was some minor injury in 
control mice following PHx, based on elevated ALT scores and his￾tology scores. There was also a higher morbidity score in control 
mice compared with low-dose CR2-Crry–treated mice (Supplemen￾tal Figure 4C). ALT levels had dropped to normal by 72 hours after 
PHx (Supplemental Figure 4D). ALT levels were significantly lower 
at 24 and 48 hours after PHx in low-dose CR2-Crry–treated mice 
compared with those in saline-treated controls.
Anti-C3d immunofluorescence microscopy of liver sections was 
used to correlate the effect of the different doses of CR2-Crry with the 
level of complement activation and liver injury/regeneration. C3d 
was deposited predominantly on hepatocyte membranes and sinu￾soidal endothelium within livers isolated from WT mice 48 hours 
after PHx. C3d was deposited with a greater intensity and was more 
widely distributed in samples from WT mice compared with sam￾ples from mice treated with 0.08 mg CR2-Crry. There was no detect￾able C3d deposition in samples from mice treated with 0.25 mg 
CR2-Crry (Figure 6). Together, these data support the concept of 
a balance between complement-dependent injury and a comple￾ment-dependent proliferative response in liver regeneration fol￾lowing PHx. Thus, it is possible that in a clinical setting impaired 
liver regeneration following resection or SFS transplantation may 
be a consequence of excessive complement activation and inflam￾mation following I/R.
Complement inhibition in a combined model of IRI and PHx. Since 
hepatic I/R results in a significant level of complement activation 
and complement-dependent injury (refer to Figure 1), we investi￾gated the effect of complement inhibition in a model that incorpo￾rates both IRI and 70% PHx, a model mimicking the procedure used 
for massive liver resection under the Pringle maneuver. WT or C3–/–
mice were subjected to 30-minute hepatic ischemia, during which time 
70% PHx was performed. WT mice were treated with either 0.08 mg 
CR2-Crry or 0.25 mg CR2-Crry immediately after surgery. Only 20% 
of C3–/– mice survived for 48 hours following surgery, compared 
with 90% survival of WT mice (Figure 7A). Compared with WT mice, 
surviving C3–/– mice had significantly increased hepatic injury and 
an impaired proliferative response (Figure 7, B–E). Of note, WT mice 
that underwent the combined surgery had a worse outcome in terms 
of hepatic injury and hepatocyte proliferation than WT mice that 
underwent 70% PHx alone (refer to Figure 3). Treatment of WT mice 
with 0.25 mg CR2-Crry, a dose that was highly protective against 
IRI, also resulted in a significantly poorer outcome in the combined 
model, with increased hepatic injury, decreased BrdU incorporation, 
and lower liver weights at 48 hours after surgery compared with con￾trol animals (Figure 7). In contrast, low-dose CR2-Crry treatment 
resulted in no mortality and a significantly improved outcome in 
terms of hepatic injury and liver regeneration when compared with 
all other groups, including, importantly, WT control. The level of 
hepatic injury correlated with neutrophil infiltration, as measured 
by MPO activity (Figure 7F).
We also investigated the effect of complement inhibition on 
TNF-α and IL-6 levels. At 6 hours after reperfusion in this com￾bined model, serum TNF-α levels positively correlated with hepatic 
injury. Serum IL-6 levels, on the other hand, were negatively corre￾lated with injury, with significantly higher IL-6 levels seen in mice 
treated with 0.08 mg CR2-Crry compared with all other groups 
(Figure 8, A and B). This is consistent with the important role for 
IL-6 in the regenerative response, and although TNF-α levels were 
lower in 0.08 mg CR2-Crry–treated mice compared with other 
test groups, this level was still significantly elevated compared

with sham-operated mice. Interestingly, at 48 hours after reperfu￾sion, the situation for IL-6 was reversed, with serum IL-6 levels in 
low-dose CR2-Crry–treated mice being significantly lower than in 
C3–/– mice or mice treated with high-dose CR2-Crry. Serum TNF-α
levels remained significantly lower in low-dose CR2-Crry–treated 
mice compared with all other groups (Figure 8, C and D). TNF-α
and IL-6 are considered important for the priming phase of the 
regenerative response, and hepatic expression of these cytokines 
peaks at around 1–2 hours and 3–6 hours after PHx, respectively. 
We therefore also determined hepatic levels of TNF-α and IL-6 
at 3 hours after IRI and PHx. Compared with WT mice, C3 defi￾ciency and high-dose complement inhibition resulted in signifi￾cantly reduced levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in the liver (Figure 8, E 
and F). In contrast, low-dose CR2-Crry treatment correlated with 
significantly increased hepatic levels of both cytokines relative to 
all other groups, including WT. Thus, low-dose complement inhi￾bition and enhanced liver regeneration is associated with increased 
early hepatic production of these cytokines and with diminished 
systemic levels of the inflammatory cytokines by 48 hours after 
PHx, compared with all other groups.
Effect of complement deficiency and complement inhibition on 
signaling pathways, ATP levels, and oxidative injury following IRI 
and PHx. Additional studies were performed to further elucidate 
potential mechanisms of hepatoprotection and regeneration in 
CR2-Crry–treated mice. In addition to regulating the activation of 
STAT3, IL-6 also activates the PI3K/Akt survival pathway, a path￾way that has been shown to play an important role in the early 
regenerative response following PHx and that regulates progres￾sion of the G1 phase during regeneration (30). We therefore deter￾mined whether the high levels of early IL-6 expression associated 
with low-dose complement inhibition correlated with increased 
STAT3 and Akt activation. Phosphorylation of STAT3 and Akt 
after IRI and PHx was determined in livers isolated from comple￾ment-deficient and complement-inhibited mice. C3 deficiency and 
high-dose complement inhibition markedly reduced STAT3 acti￾vation following IRI and PHx, compared with that in saline-treat￾ed mice and mice treated with low-dose complement inhibition 
(Figure 9A). Further, there was an increase in STAT3 activation in 
low-dose CR2-Crry–treated mice compared with saline controls at 
both 3 and 6 hours after IRI and PHx. Low-dose CR2-Crry treat￾ment was also associated with an increase in Akt phosphorylation 
at 6 hours after IRI and PHx (Figure 9A).
Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative injury occurs in the 
liver after I/R and also after massive resection. Also, cellular ATP 
stores have been shown to play an important role in liver regen￾eration, by supplying energy and regulating posttranscriptional 
activation of cyclin D1/cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) complexes 
(31–33). To investigate whether the effect of complement inhibi￾tion on hepatoprotection and liver regeneration was associated 
with hepatic ATP levels, ATP concentrations were measured in 
liver samples from all groups at various time points after IRI and 
PHx. There was a marked reduction in hepatic ATP in all groups at 
6 hours after IRI and PHx (Figure 9B). However, whereas ATP levels 
remained low in C3–/– mice and mice treated with high-dose CR2-

after IRI and PHx in mice treated with low-dose CR2-Crry.
The production of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation 
is considered a major mechanism of hepatic injury following I/R 
and extreme liver resection. The effect of complement inhibition 
on oxidative injury to the liver following IRI and PHx was exam￾ined by measuring levels of hepatic glutathione (GSH), GSH per￾oxidase (GPX1), and malondialdehyde (MDA). There were reduced 
levels of GSH (antioxidant) and increased levels of MDA (index 
of lipid peroxidation) in saline-treated animals after IRI and PHx, 
which is indicative of oxidative stress (Figure 10, A and B). Levels of 
the free radical scavenger GPX1 were also reduced in saline-treated 
animals following IRI and PHx (Figure 10C). In contrast, treat￾ment of mice with 0.08 mg CR2-Crry after IRI and PHx protected 
against oxidative stress as indicated by significantly increased lev￾els of GSH and GPX1 and decreased levels of MDA.
IL-6 blockade and complement inhibition following IRI and PHx. Final￾ly, since low-dose complement inhibition increased IL-6 levels after 
IRI and PHx, and since IL-6 signaling is essential for the priming 
phase of liver regeneration, we sought to clarify whether there was 
a link between the hepatoprotective and pro-regenerative effect of 
low-dose complement inhibition and IL-6 expression. IL-6 block￾Figure 6

livers were removed and sections were analyzed for C3d deposition by 
immunofluorescence microscopy. Complement deposition was local￾ized to the central lobular areas and was associated with hepatocyte 
and sinusoidal endothelial cells in WT mice. C3 deposition was reduced 
in mice treated with 0.08 mg CR2-Crry and was absent in mice treated 
with 0.25 mg CR2-Crry and in C3–/– mice. Representative images, n = 3.

ade by administration of anti–IL-6 antibodies, together with CR2-
Crry treatment, reduced hepatic levels of IL-6 by about 65% at 
3 hours after IRI and PHx and reduced serum levels of IL-6 by about 
50% at 6 hours after IRI and PHx (Figure 11, A and B). Further, IL-6 
blockade significantly reduced levels of phosphorylated STAT3 
following IRI and PHx, indicating a direct relationship between 
increased levels of IL-6 and STAT3 activation (Figure 11C). IL-6 
blockade resulted in significantly increased liver injury (serum 
ALT) and a significantly impaired regenerative response (BrdU 
incorporation) in mice subjected to IRI and PHx and treated with 
low-dose CR2-Crry (Figure 11, D and E). In addition, only 4 of 
10 mice receiving anti–IL-6 antibody and CR2-Crry survived for 
more than 48 hours after IRI and PHx (data not shown). Thus, the 
protective effect of low-dose complement inhibition following IRI 
and PHx was lost when complement inhibitor treatment was com￾bined with IL-6 blockade. Taken together, these results suggest 
that the hepatoprotective effect of low-dose (but not high-dose) 
complement inhibition is due to the role of complement in IL-6 
expression and subsequent priming of the regenerative response.
Discussion
Failure of the liver to regenerate following massive liver resection or 
SFS liver transplantation often leads to liver dysfunction. A compo￾nent of these surgical procedures is a period of ischemia and subse￾quent reperfusion that is injurious to the liver and which is thought 
to have a deleterious effect on regeneration. Here, we investigated 
the dual role of complement in hepatic IRI and liver regeneration.
The pathogenic mechanisms involved in IRI are complex and mul￾tifaceted, but it is clear that activation of complement is a key initiat￾ing event. An important role for complement in hepatic IRI is fairly 
well documented in rat models (see Introduction), and in the first set 
of studies reported here, we show that complement deficiency and 
complement inhibition is protective in a mouse model. In a second set 
of studies, we confirmed and extended previous studies that demon￾strated an important role for complement in liver regeneration, and 
we also observed that a significant increase in hepatosteatosis was 
associated with C3 deficiency. Since C3a has been shown to play an 
important role in liver regeneration (14), and since its degraded form, 
ASP (C3ades-Arg), plays a role in lipid metabolism, we investigated 
the effect of ASP reconstitution in C3–/– mice following PHx. Previous 
studies have shown that the hepatic proliferative response is restored 
in C3–/– mice reconstituted with multiple doses of C3a (14) and that 
liver regeneration is impaired in C3aR–/– mice (13). However, ASP does 
not bind to C3aR. Although controversial, the only identified receptor 
for ASP is C5L2 (23–26, 34, 35), a receptor that also binds C3a (and 
C5a/C5ades-Arg) and that plays an important role in triglyceride syn￾thesis and clearance (25, 26). We found that administration of 15 μg 
ASP to C3–/– mice after PHx significantly (P < 0.05) reduced hepatos￾teatosis, protected against injury, restored BrdU incorporation to the 
level seen in WT mice, and reversed the decrease in STAT3 phosphory￾lation seen in C3–/– mice. These data indicate that the involvement of 
complement in the proliferative response can be independent of C3aR 
signaling and indicate a key role for ASP in hepatoprotection and liver 
regeneration following PHx. In view of previous data showing that 
C3aR–/– mice have an impaired regenerative response, there may be 
different and intercepting roles for complement in hepatoprotection 
and regeneration induced following PHx. One possibility is that since 
ASP plays an important role in lipid metabolism, steatosis observed

in C3–/– mice following PHx may be due to an inhibition of produc￾tive triglyceride lipolysis and fatty acid release, resulting in an insuf￾ficient energy supply for regeneration. The putative receptor for 
ASP, C5L2, also plays an important role in lipid metabolism, and we 
show here that C5L2 deficiency also results in steatosis and impaired 
regeneration following PHx. Based on current and previous data 
(reviewed in refs. 36, 37), with the controversy over ASP/C5L2 inter￾action notwithstanding, one potential mechanism for the develop￾ment of steatosis in C3–/– and C5L2–/– mice following PHx is that in 
the absence of ASP/C5L2 signaling, there is a decreased rate of tri￾glyceride synthesis in adipose tissue. This may lead to increased fatty 
acid delivery to the liver and, due to delayed clearance of triglycerides 
in the liver, the development of steatosis. The finding that admin￾istration of 15 μg ASP to C5L2–/– mice after PHx had no effect on 
hepatic injury, regeneration, or STAT3 activation is consistent with 
the hypothesis that ASP modulates regeneration via a mechanism 
involving its interaction with C5L2. Nevertheless, we demonstrated 
complement activation in C5L2–/– mice following PHx, indicating 
endogenous production of ASP, and further research is needed to 
better understand the role of ASP and C5L2 in liver regeneration. 
Also in need of clarification are the relative and interacting roles 
of C5aR and C5L2, since an important role for C5a/C5aR in liver 
regeneration has been documented (14).
An unexpected finding was that reconstitution of C3–/– mice with 
a high dose of ASP (50 μg) following PHx failed to restore liver regen￾eration and induced severe injury. Moreover, WT mice treated with 
either a low or high dose of ASP exhibited a significant increase in 
liver injury with impaired regeneration compared with untreated WT 
animals (P < 0.05, data not shown). While previous and current data 
together indicate a role for both C3a and ASP in liver regeneration, 
both peptides have proinflammatory properties, although removal 
of the C-terminal Arg from C3a inactivates certain activities (26, 38). 
The significant increases seen in liver MPO activity and in serum lev￾els of TNF-α and IL-6 associated with high-dose ASP treatment in 
C3–/– mice testifies to the proinflammatory properties of ASP and 
suggests that there is a threshold of complement activation and 
C3a/ASP production for optimal liver regeneration following PHx. 
Indeed, while TNF-α and IL-6 play important roles in liver regen￾eration, there appear to be dual roles for these cytokines in injury 
versus hepatoprotection and regeneration (27, 39). Although IL-6–
dependent processes are associated mainly with protective responses, 
TNF-α expression is clearly associated with inflammation and injury, 
and these cytokines can modulate the expression of each other. For 
example, IL-6 plays a key role in initiating the proliferative response 
and IL-6 expression appears to be dependent on NF-κB activation 
that is induced by TNF-α (40). NF-κB activation is also dependent on 
other factors that influence inhibitory IkBα, and TNF-α may initiate 
apoptotic pathways in the absence of NF-κB activation (41). In other 
studies, IL-6 has been shown to be protective in a model of warm 
IRI via a mechanism that appears to involve the downregulation of 
TNF-α (42), and liver injury in various models has been shown to be 
associated with increased expression of both TNF-α and IL-6.

In a more clinically relevant setting of complement inhibition, we 
found that a 0.25-mg dose of CR2-Crry administered immediately 
after PHx resulted in severe liver injury and impaired regeneration, 
similar to that seen in C3–/– mice. Surprisingly, however, low-dose 
CR2-Crry treatment following PHx resulted in an improved outcome 
relative to control saline treatment, with CR2-Crry–treated mice dis￾playing significantly less hepatic injury and a significantly enhanced 
proliferative response. Taken together, the above data indicate that 
there is a threshold of complement activation and C3a/ASP pro￾duction for optimal liver regeneration following PHx, above which 
increased levels of C3a/ASP (and indeed other complement activation 
products) tip the balance toward injury and impairment of regener￾ation. This balance will likely be influenced by the varying roles of 
complement in hepatic metabolism, inflammation, and regeneration. 
Although there is no direct significant ischemic or inflammatory 
insult to remnant liver after 70% PHx, there are substantial hemo￾dynamic changes, with an increase in portal blood and a very likely 
decrease in oxygen pressure that could trigger a hypoxic response, 
leading to complement activation. We observed increased ALT levels 
and increased morbidity in control mice, compared with mice treated 
with low-dose CR2-Crry early after PHx, indicating some liver injury. 
This is consistent with the hypothesis that PHx alone results in a level 
of complement activation that is slightly in excess of that required for 
optimal regeneration and that low-dose complement inhibition tips 
the injury/regeneration balance toward regeneration. In a clinical set￾ting of massive liver resection or SFS transplantation, hepatic I/R is 
unavoidable and results in complement activation and inflammation, 
and several studies have highlighted the deleterious effect of IRI on 
liver regeneration. Thus, we further investigated the role of comple￾ment in the balance between liver injury and regeneration in a model 
incorporating both IRI and PHx.
Although C3 deficiency protected against hepatic IRI, the combina￾tion of IRI and PHx in C3–/– mice resulted in significant liver damage 
compared with WT mice, as well as a failure of the liver to regenerate. 
The result was similar in mice treated with 0.25 mg CR2-Crry. Low￾dose CR2-Crry treatment, however, significantly improved outcome 
in terms of liver injury and regeneration, not only when compared 
with C3–/– and high-dose CR2-Crry–treated mice but also compared 
with WT mice. We propose that while hepatic I/R results in comple￾ment activation, incomplete blockade of the complement pathway 
provides a level of protection from IRI, while allowing generation of 
C3a (and C5a) at levels sufficient to promote regeneration.
To further address the protective mechanisms of low-dose com￾plement inhibition following IRI and PHx, we determined the effect 
of CR2-Crry on neutrophil infiltration, cytokine levels, activation 
of transcription factors, hepatic ATP levels, and oxidative injury. 
Hepatic MPO activity following IRI and PHx correlated with injury 
and was significantly lower in mice treated with 0.08 mg CR2-Crry 
compared with all other test groups. Neutrophil infiltration has 
been shown to play a vital role in hepatic IRI and impairment of 
liver regeneration, and C3a and C5a can mediate this process.
Hepatic levels of TNF-α and IL-6 were significantly higher at 3 hours 
after IRI and PHx in the low-dose CR2-Crry–treated group, and 
early expression of these cytokines is important for priming the 
regenerative response. At later time points, however, cytokine 
expression increased in C3–/– mice and in high-dose CR2-Crry–
treated mice relative to low-dose CR2-Crry mice, which together 
with MPO data is indicative of increased and ongoing inflamma￾tion. IL-6–induced activation of STAT3 plays a key role in cell-cycle 
progression in liver regeneration, and elevated early expression of 
IL-6 in low-dose CR2-Crry–treated mice correlated with increased 
STAT3 activation. Low-dose CR2-Crry also resulted in enhanced 
activation of Akt, a transcription factor involved in the phosphory￾lation of downstream targets that control cell growth and surviv￾al. Lipid peroxidation is considered a major mechanism of tissue 
damage following I/R, and the measurement of various markers 
of oxidative injury following IRI and PHx revealed a significant 
attenuation of oxidative stress in mice treated with low-dose CR2-
Crry compared with other groups. An increased capacity to protect 
against lipid peroxidation and membrane injury may also contrib￾ute to the improved maintenance of ATP levels in mice treated 
with low-dose CR2-Crry. These results identify several potential 
mechanisms by which low-dose complement inhibition improves 
regeneration following IRI and PHx, including induction of IL-6,

enhancement of STAT3 and Akt activation, reduction in hepatic 
ATP depletion, and attenuation of oxidative injuries.
In conclusion, this study provides additional information on the 
role of complement in hepatic IRI and regeneration and provides data 
supporting a complement-dependent balance in the link between 
IRI and impaired regeneration. These findings shed new light on the 
pathogenic mechanisms involved in the failure of liver regeneration 
and suggest that an approach of modulated complement inhibition 
represents a potential therapeutic strategy for patients undergoing 
massive liver resection or SFS liver transplantation.
Methods
Animal studies. C3–/– mice and WT controls were obtained from The Jackson 
Laboratory. C5L2–/+ heterozygous mice were provided by Regeneron Pharma￾ceuticals Inc., courtesy of Joseph Sorrentino (Tarrytown, New York, USA), and 
C5L2–/– and WT littermates determined by PCR genotyping. All procedures 
were approved by the Medical University of South Carolina Institutional 
Animal Care and Use Committee, in accordance with the National Research 
Council 1996 guide for the care and use of laboratory animals. All mice were 
on C57BL/6 background and were used when 8–10 weeks old and weighing 
between 22.5–25 g. Mice were fed a pellet diet with water ad libitum and kept 
on a 12-hour-light/12-hour-dark cycle. For all procedures, mice were anes￾thetized with a intraperitoneal injection of 0.05 ml/10 g body weight of a 
“ketamine cocktail”, consisting of ketamine (13 mg/ml), xylazine (2.6 mg/ml), 
and acepromazine (0.15 mg/ml) in sterile normal saline. Animals were sub￾jected to 1 of the following 3 different procedures. (a) For procedures involv￾ing hepatic IRI, mice were subjected to total warm hepatic I/R, as previously 
described (43). The portal vein and hepatic artery were occluded for 30 min￾utes with a microaneurysm clamp to induce hepatic ischemia, followed by a 
6-hour period of reperfusion. For some experiments, we also used a model of 
partial warm hepatic IRI (see Supplemental Figure 1). Mice were subjected 
to occlusion of the left lateral and median lobes of the liver, by applying an 
atraumatic microvascular clamp to the vascular pedicle (44). After 90 minutes 
of partial warm ischemia, the clamp was removed, initiating hepatic reperfu￾sion. In all IRI studies, CR2-Crry or normal saline was administered i.p. imme￾diately after ischemia. Mice were sacrificed at predetermined time points after 
reperfusion for serum and liver sampling. (b) For procedures involving 70% 
PHx, surgery was performed as previously described (45, 46), with resection of 
the median and left lateral liver lobes. (c) For procedures involving combined 
I/R and PHx, a model was developed incorporating both of the above hepatic 
I/R and PHx procedures. The portal vein and hepatic artery were occluded for 
30 minutes, and during the ischemic period, 70% PHx was performed. Follow￾ing surgeries, mice were sacrificed, and livers and blood samples were collect￾ed at different time points after operation. Blood was also collected from the 
vena cava for serum preparation at the time of sacrifice and at 6 hours in the 
PHx and IRI and PHx models. Harvested livers were weighted to assess regen￾eration, and portions of liver tissue were either fixed in 10% neutralized for￾malin for histological evaluation or were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and 
maintained at –80°C until homogenization for various biochemical assays.

saline was administered i.p. immediately after surgery. CR2-Crry was admin￾istered at a dose of 0.25 mg, based on effective protection in previous studies 
of intestinal and cerebral IRI (47, 48), and at one-third the dose, 0.08 mg. 
CR2-Crry was prepared as previously described (47). Based on a previous 
study done in rats (49), IL-6 blockade was accomplished using goat anti￾mouse IL-6 antibody (R&D Systems) injected i.p. at 200 μg/kg body weight. 
The IL-6 antibody or normal goat IgG (control) was injected i.p. immediately 
after surgery and just prior to CR2-Crry administration.
ASP/C3ades-Arg reconstitution. Recombinant human ASP/C3ades-Arg 
was prepared and purified by a modification of the original procedure 
(50), using a His-tag at the amino-terminal, with initial purification on a 
Ni-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences), followed by HPLC. No 
denaturing agents were used at any step in the purification to avoid ASP 
inactivation. ASP was administered at a dose of either 15 μg or 50 μg per 
mouse in 200 μl saline, by i.p. injection immediately after PHx. Endotoxin 
levels in the ASP preparation were analyzed by the Limulus Amebocyte 
Lysate assay (E-Toxate kit; Sigma-Aldrich) and 25 μg/μl ASP (100 times 
higher concentration than used) tested negative for endotoxin. Mouse ASP 
and human ASP are not identical, but it has been shown that human ASP 
interacts with mouse C5L2, activates mouse cells, and enhances postpran￾dial triglyceride clearance in WT and C3–/– mouse models (26).
Microscopy. For histological examination, tissue blocks were placed in 10% 
buffered formaldehyde solution for 48 hours before being embedded in paraf￾fin. Liver histology was assessed by light microscopy (Olympus BH -2) of H&E￾stained 4-μm sections in a blinded fashion. Ten random fields on each slide 
were assessed for necrosis by standard morphologic criteria (loss of architec￾ture, vacuolization, karyolysis, increased eosinophilia), and the extent of necro￾sis was semiquantitatively estimated by assigning a severity score on a scale of 
0–4 as previously described (51) (absent, 0; mild, 1; moderate, 2; severe, 3; and 
total necrotic destruction of the liver, 4). The score was used to compare the 
liver damage after I/R and/or PHx between different study groups. Steatosis 
was assessed by oil red O staining as previously described (52). C3 deposition in 
liver samples was determined by immunofluorescence using anti-mouse FITC￾conjugated C3d antibody (Dako Cytomation) as previously described (18).
Biochemical and immunological assays. Serum levels of ALT and total bilirubin 
were determined using analytical kits from Sigma-Aldrich according to manu￾facturer’s instructions. Serum levels of TNF-α and IL-6 were measured by ELISA 
using kits from eBiosciences. For measurement of hepatic TNF-α and IL-6 
levels, frozen liver samples were homogenized in extraction buffer (50 mmol/l 
Tris, pH 7.2, 150 mmol/l NaCl, Triton X-100, and a protease inhibitor cocktail). 
The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 g and 4°C for 8 minutes, and TNF-α
and IL-6 levels in supernatants were measured by ELISA using a kit from 
eBiosciences. For quantitative assessment of neutrophil infiltration into the 
liver parenchyma, liver MPO content was assessed, using the Hbt mouse MPO 
ELISA Kit from Hycult Biotechnology according to manufacturer’s instruc￾tions. Liver samples were prepared, and hepatic triglyceride content of samples 
was determined using a triglyceride test kit as described by the manufacturer 
(Stanbio Laboratory). The levels of GSH and MDA in liver samples were deter￾mined spectrophotometrically by commercially available kits (Bioxytech GSH 
and MDA-586 kits; OXIS International Inc.), as reported previously (43). The 
calculated concentrations of lipid peroxidation products were normalized by 
protein concentration and expressed as nmol/mg protein.
Assessment of liver regeneration. Three independent markers for hepatic 
regeneration were used. Reconstitution of liver weight was expressed as per￾centage of regenerated liver mass relative to total liver weight and was calcu￾lated as described previously (53). For assessment of hepatic proliferation, 
BrdU was injected (50 mg/kg i.p.) 2 hours prior to harvesting of liver. BrdU 
incorporation in liver sections was determined by immunohistochemical 
staining, as described previously (54). Positive and negative cells were count￾ed in 10 randomly selected fields by light microscopy using a ×40 objec￾tive lens. Constantly proliferating intestinal crypt epithelium served as a 
positive control for BrdU incorporation and staining. The mitotic index was 
determined in H&E sections using previously reported criteria for mitosis 
as follows: complete absence of cell membrane, slight eosinophilic staining 
of nucleus, nuclear spindle matrix formation, absence of a nucleolus, and 
slight increase in cell size (55). The mitotic index was expressed as the rate 
of positive cells per 1,000 hepatocytes/high-power field. All analyses were 
performed with the operator blinded to the experimental groups.
Assessment of morbidity. Clinical scores of morbidity were assessed 48 hours 
after PHx, as previously described (56). Each mouse was graded from 0 to 3 
(normal, 0; slight effect, 1; moderate effect, 2; severe effect, 3) for posture, coat, 
and activity, and scores combined to a final score on a scale from 0 to 9.
Measurement of liver ATP content. Approximately 50 mg frozen liver tissue 
was homogenized in 500 μl ice-cold tissue lysis buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) with 
a protease inhibitor cocktail (Pierce). The homogenates were centrifuged 
at 10,000 g for 8 minutes at 4°C, and ATP in supernatants was extracted 
using 1.5% trichloroacetic acid. Supernatants were then diluted in 1:150 
Tris acetate buffer (pH 7.85), and 100 μl reconstituted luciferin-luciferase 
solution was added to a 100 μl diluted sample (Enliten, Promega), and lucif￾erase activity was immediately evaluated luminometrically. ATP content 
in the samples was determined by comparison to a concurrent standard 
curve. Protein concentration was also determined, and the calculated con￾centrations of ATP content were normalized by protein concentration and 
expressed as mmol/mg protein.
Western blot analysis of GPX1 and STAT3 and Akt activation.Liver samples were 
homogenized on ice in lysis buffer (Sigma-Aldrich), containing protease 
inhibitor cocktail (Pierce). Homogenates were sonicated and centrifuged at 
10,000 g at 4°C to remove cellular debris. Protein concentrations were deter￾mined. Samples containing equal amounts of protein in equal volumes of 
sample buffer were separated in a 4%–15% Tris-HCl polyacrylamide gel and 
transferred to PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad). Nonspecific binding sites were 
blocked with Tris-buffered saline, containing 5% nonfat dry milk, for 1 hour 
at room temperature. Membranes were then incubated with antibodies to 
GPX1, Akt, phospho-Akt, STAT3, phospho-STAT3 (Cell Signaling Technol￾ogy), or GAPDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) in Tris-buffered saline 
with 0.1% Tween 20. Membranes were washed and incubated with second￾ary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Immunoreactive pro￾teins were detected via enhanced chemiluminescence.
Statistics. Data are expressed as mean ± SD. Significant differences between 
groups were determined by ANOVA, with a Bonferroni correction for con￾tinuous variable and multiple groups. Two-tailed Student’s t test was used 
for the comparison of a normally distributed continuous variable between 
2 groups. For the survival studies, Kaplan-Meier log-rank analysis was per￾formed. P values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
