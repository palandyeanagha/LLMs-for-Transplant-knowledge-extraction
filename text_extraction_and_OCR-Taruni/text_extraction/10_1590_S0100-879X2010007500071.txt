Abstract
We studied the effect of oral sirolimus, administered to prevent and treat in-stent restenosis (ISR), on the variation of serum 
levels of inflammatory markers following coronary stenting with bare metal stents. The mean age of the patients was 56 ± 13 
years, 65% were males and all had clinically manifested ischemia. Serum levels of high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) 
concentration were determined by chemiluminescence and serum levels of all other biomarkers by ELISA. One group of patients 
at high risk for ISR received a loading oral dose of 15 mg sirolimus and 5 mg daily thereafter for 28 days after stenting (SIR-G).
A control group (CONT-G) was submitted to stenting without sirolimus therapy. The increase in hs-CRP concentration was 
highest at 24 h after stenting in both groups. A significant difference between SIR-G and CONT-G was observed at 4 weeks 
(-1.50 ± 5.0 vs -0.19 ± 0.4, P = 0.008) and lost significance 1 month after sirolimus discontinuation (-1.73 ± 4.3 vs -0.01 ± 0.7, 
P = 0.0975). A continuous fall in MMP-9 concentration was observed in SIR-G, with the greatest reduction at 4 weeks (-352.9 
± 455 vs +395.2 ± 377, P = 0.0004), while a positive variation was noted 4 weeks after sirolimus discontinuation (227 ± 708 vs
406.2 ± 472.1, P = 0.0958). SIR-G exhibited a higher increase in P-selectin after sirolimus discontinuation at week 8 (46.1 ± 67.9 
vs 5.8 ± 23.7, P = 0.0025). These findings suggest that the anti-restenotic actions of systemic sirolimus include anti-proliferative 
effects and modulation of the inflammatory response with inhibition of adhesion molecule expression.

It is well known that coronary artery angioplasty and 
stenting are both associated with local vascular and systemic 
inflammation (1-4), which in turn correlate with increased 
restenosis after percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) 
(5-7). However, the nature of the inflammatory response 
to coronary artery stenting is different from that associ￾ated with balloon angioplasty, and the specific biological 
response to stent injury is strongly associated with intimal 
smooth muscle cell migration/proliferation that culminates 
in in-stent restenosis (ISR) (8).
Because of the specific characteristics of the inflamma￾tory response to different types of injury, different drugs and 
drug regimens for the treatment of restenosis may produce 
diverse effects. Sirolimus is an immunosuppressant agent 
with anti-proliferative, anti-migratory and anti-inflammatory 
properties (9) and is FDA-approved for the prophylaxis of 
renal transplantation rejection in the United States (10). 
More recently, sirolimus has been used to prevent ISR with 
a coated stent design with good clinical and angiographic 
results (11). 
A number of clinical studies have tested oral sirolimus 
to prevent or to treat ISR. Despite having studied highly 
heterogeneous patient groups and drug regimens, these 
studies have shown a significant reduction of angiographic 
ISR (12-15). The aim of the present study was to charac￾terize the systemic response of biomarkers known to be 
involved in the vascular response to coronary stenting and 
determine if oral sirolimus has any effect on the behavior 
of these biomarkers.
Material and Methods
The following biomarkers were evaluated: high sen￾sitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), soluble interleukin-2

receptor alpha (IL-2sRα), monocyte chemoattractant 
protein-1 (MCP-1), matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), 
matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), tissue inhibitor of 
MMP-1 (TIMP-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM￾1), and P-selectin.
Patient population
Three groups of patients were compared. The sirolimus￾treated group (SIR-G) comprised 11 patients treated with 
oral sirolimus one day before and 28 days after stenting 
and who had been enrolled in a previous study (13). These 
patients were at high risk for developing ISR, with 17 lesions 
in native coronary arteries (9 de novo and 8 ISR), without 
angina or documented ischemia. The control group (CONT￾G) contained 12 consecutive patients, matched for gender 
and age to the SIR-G, who underwent coronary stenting and 
were not treated with sirolimus. These patients underwent 
PCI for 15 de novo lesions in native vessels. The reference 
group (REF-G) included 25 healthy volunteers with very low 
probability of coronary artery disease recruited to provide 
biomarker reference levels. The clinical and angiographic 
characteristics of the participants are reported in Table 1.
Study protocol and pharmacological regimens
The study protocol, which is in accordance with the 1975 
Declaration of Helsinki, was approved by the Research 
Ethics Committee of Hospital São Paulo and Hospital do 
Rim e Hipertensão, Universidade Federal de São Paulo. 
Written informed consent was obtained from each patient. 
SIR-G and CONT-G patients underwent PCI with coronary 
stenting according to standard techniques. Intra-coronary 
nitroglycerin (300 µg) was given before the angiograms. The 
SIR-G and CONT-G groups received a loading dose of 300 
mg clopidogrel 6 h before the procedure and 75 mg daily for 
30 days after PCI. SIR-G patients received a loading dose 
of 15 mg sirolimus the day before the procedure followed 
by 5 mg daily for 28 days. Whole blood concentrations of 
sirolimus were measured weekly by ultraviolet wavelength 
high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC/UV) (16), 
and the drug dose was adjusted to maintain a whole blood 
concentration of 10-15 ng/mL.
Venous blood for biomarker protein measurements were 
collected at similar times from both SIR-G and CONT-G: 
the day before the procedure, 24 h after the procedure, 
and 1, 4, and 8 weeks thereafter. Samples were collected 
only once for patients in the REF-G. After centrifugation, 
serum was separated and divided into small aliquots, one 
for each biomarker assayed, and stored at -85°C.
Patients in the experimental groups were followed 
weekly for 8 weeks. Hematological tests, urea, creatinine, 
total cholesterol and its fractions, and triglycerides were 
measured weekly in SIR-G patients up to the 4th week 
and 4 weeks after drug discontinuation (8th week). Sig￾nificant thrombocytopenia (<100,000 platelets/dL) and/or 
leukopenia (<3000 white blood cells/dL) were criteria for 
drug discontinuation.
Laboratory assays
hs-CRP concentration was determined by chemilumi￾nescence (Immulite, DPC Labs, USA). Intra- and interassay 
coefficients of variation for hs-CRP measurement were 
less than 6.4 and 10%, respectively. MMP-2, MMP-9 and 
P-selectin were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay (ELISA) with a commercially available kit (Quantikine 
HS Human, R&D Systems, USA). The detection limits were 
0.16 ng/mL for MMP-2, 0.156 ng/mL for MMP-9 and 0.5 
ng/mL for P-selectin. Intra- and interassay coefficients of 
variation were less than 3 and 8% for MMP-9, and less 
than 6 and 10% for MMP-2 and P-selectin, respectively. 
IL-2sRα, MCP-1, TIMP-1, and ICAM-1 were also measured 
with ELISA kits (DuoSet ELISA development system, R&D 
Systems) with detection limits of 0.031, 0.015, 0.031, and 
0.015 ng/mL, respectively. Intra- and interassay coefficients 
of variation were less than 10% in both cases for these bio￾markers. All ELISA measurements were done in duplicate. 
Difference in duplicate was always less than 10%. 
Data presentation and statistical analysis
Data are reported as means ± SD. Baseline values of 
all biomarkers were defined as the absolute levels mea￾sured before the coronary interventions. At follow-up, the 
changes in the levels of biomarkers in relation to baseline 
values (deltas) were computed for each time. ANOVA was 
used for comparisons between groups at baseline; if differ￾ences were found, the Tukey test was applied for multiple 
comparisons. At follow-up, changes from baseline at 4 times 
(24 h, 1 week, 4 weeks, 8 weeks) were evaluated using a 
Table 1. Baseline clinical and angiographic characteristics.

mixed-model repeated measures analysis of variance with 
Kenward-Roger correction for degrees of freedom. In the 
presence of statistically significant time vs group interac￾tions, tests of simple effects were used to test the group 
effect at each time. To help visualize the interaction, plots 
of group vs time least-squares means with 95% confidence 
intervals were generated. Additionally, because of the non￾randomized nature of the study, SIR-G and CONT-G groups 
were compared at each time by analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) models with adjustment for values of biomarkers 
before the stent implantation - baseline levels - in order to 
correct for intrinsic differences between the two groups.
All statistical analyses were performed using the SAS 
software (version 9.2; SAS Institute, Inc., USA). All P val￾ues are two-sided. A P value <0.05 was considered to be 
significant while a P value <0.10 and ≥0.05 was considered 
to be marginally significant. 
Results
Whole blood concentration of sirolimus and side 
effect monitoring
The mean whole blood sirolimus concentrations in 
SIR-G were 13.6 ± 9.6 ng/mL at week 1, 18.3 ± 9.2 ng/mL 
at week 2, 14 ± 8.2 ng/mL at week 3, and 13.4 ± 6.7 ng/mL 
at week 4. Daily doses were reduced in 5 patients to keep 
the target blood levels. The treatment was well tolerated 
by all patients, and only minor side effects were observed, 
including acne (1 patient), conjunctivitis (1 patient), and 
stomatitis (4 patients). All side effects were reversed after 
the discontinuation of sirolimus.
Baseline biomarker measurements 
SIR-G patients had higher baseline levels of MMP-9 
and TIMP-1 (Table 2) and CONT-G patients had higher 
baseline levels of ICAM-1. The other biomarkers did not 
differ significantly between SIR-G and CONT-G groups at 
baseline.
Biomarker measurements after 24 h, 1, 4, and 8 
weeks
The variation (∆) of each biomarker for SIR-G and 
CONT-G patients is presented in Table 2 and Figure 1. The 
most important findings are identified below.
hs-CRP. The concentration of serum hs-CRP was higher 
in SIR-G than in CONT-G. Peak values were observed in 
both groups 24 h after PCI. In SIR-G, the concentration 
fell in the 1st and 4th weeks and remained low up to the 
8th week, 4 weeks after sirolimus discontinuation. hs-CRP 
concentration in CONT-G returned to baseline levels after 
the 1st week and remained stable at the 4th and 8th weeks. 
The changes in serum hs-CRP observed over time were not 
different for the two groups as determined by the repeated 
measures model (F(3, 18.8) = 1.17, P = 0.3477). However, 
after ANCOVA with adjustment for baseline, no differences 
were observed at 24 h; a marginally significant difference 
was observed at week 1 (P = 0.0726), a significant differ￾ence at week 4 (P = 0.008) and a marginally significant 
difference at week 8 (P = 0.0975), 4 weeks after treatment 
discontinuation.
MMP-9. In SIR-G, serum MMP-9 concentration fell 
steadily and achieved maximal reduction at 4 weeks. At 8 
weeks, the concentration returned to pre-stenting levels. 
Contrary to what was observed for SIR-G, baseline MMP￾9 concentration rose continuously in CONT-G, reaching 
peak values at week 4. There was a significant group vs 
time interaction (F(3, 59.7) = 3.83, P = 0.0141), indicating 
that changes in MMP-9 over time were different for the 
two groups. A simple effects test showed that SIR-G and 
CONT-G were different at 1 week (-258.9 ± 510 vs +363 
± 438, P = 0.0030) and 4 weeks (-352.9 ± 455 vs +395.2 
± 377, P = 0.0004). ANCOVA with adjustment for baseline 
levels revealed no difference at 24 h, a marginally significant 
difference at week 1 (P = 0.0805), a significant difference at 
week 4 (P = 0.0062), and a marginally significant difference 
at week 8 (P = 0.0958).
MMP-2. Serum MMP-2 levels rose steadily in SIR-G, 
with the greatest increase being achieved at the 4th week. 
No significant change was observed in CONT-G. The group 
vs time effect was significant (F(3, 58) = 3.51, P = 0.0206). 
Simple effects tests revealed that the two groups were 
different only at week 4 (+53.2 ± 33.7 vs -14.2 ± 49.2, P = 
0.0014). ANCOVA also revealed a significant difference at 
week 4 (P = 0.0037).
ICAM-1. Following PCI, only non-significant variations 
were observed in both groups. CONT-G had significantly 
higher serum ICAM-1 levels than SIR-G at all times. There 
was no group vs time interaction (F(3, 16.3) = 1.66, P = 
0.2144). ANCOVA revealed significant differences at week 
1 (P = 0.0047) and week 4 (P = 0.0096).
P-selectin. No significant changes in serum P-selectin 
concentration were observed in CONT-G. However, in SIR￾G, a remarkable increase in P-selectin was observed at 8 
weeks. There was a significant group vs time effect (F(3, 
60) = 3.19, P = 0.0299). Simple effects tests suggested a 
marginally significant difference between the two groups at 
week 8 (46.1 ± 67.9 vs 5.8 ± 23.7, P = 0.0025) and ANCOVA 
showed a significant difference between the two groups at 
week 8 (P = 0.0025).
Serum MCP-1. The group vs time effect was non￾significant (F(3, 18.7) = 1.58, P = 0.2283). Differences 
between groups were detected with ANCOVA at 24 h (P 
= 0.0074).
Serum TIMP-1. No significant group vs time effect was 
detected (F(3, 18.5) = 0.57, P = 0.6438). No significant dif￾ference was found with ANCOVA.
Serum IL-2sRα. There was no significant group vs time 
effect (F(3, 18.9) = 0.55, P = 0.6536). ANCOVA showed a 
significant difference between the two groups at 24 h (P 
= 0.0015), a marginally significant difference at 1 week

(P = 0.0781), and a significant difference at 8 weeks (P 
= 0.0004).
Discussion
Sirolimus has been used systemically to prevent and 
treat cardiovascular disorders mainly because of its ability 
to inhibit smooth muscle cell proliferation. Its efficacy in 
treating restenosis has been successfully tested in animal 
models of balloon angioplasty (17) and in humans submitted 
to coronary artery stenting (12-15). We speculated that if 
oral sirolimus modifies the biological response to coronary 
artery stenting, it might also alter the expression of biomark￾ers related to the implantation of coronary stents and ISR. 
To our knowledge, this is the first investigation concerning 
the effect of oral sirolimus on biomarkers of the vascular

Oral sirolimus and inflammatory markers after stenting 791

of sirolimus in the United States (10). The same dosing 
scheme was also used by Waksman et al. (12) to prevent 
and treat ISR with good tolerability. It is important to note that 
the side effects were not severe, they were reversed after 
drug discontinuation and did not prevent the subsequent 
use of the full drug course.
Two biomarkers, MMP-9 and TIMP-1, had higher plasma 
concentrations at baseline in SIR-G than in CONT-G. Dur￾ing follow-up, SIR-G had higher mean concentrations of 
hs-CRP, IL-2sRα and P-selectin. These differences may 
be explained in part by the greater severity of coronary 
artery disease in the SIR-G group. SIR-G patients had a 
higher risk profile as compared to these CONT-G. More 
SIR-G patients had hypertension (91 vs 58%), chronic renal 
failure (17 vs 8%) and diabetes (42 vs 33%). Moreover, 8 
patients in SIR-G had ISR vs none in CONT-G. In fact, not 
only have hs-CRP and other inflammatory markers been 
described as tools to stratify coronary artery disease risk, 
but they are also known as indicators of the extent of the 
disease (18).
The results of our study corroborate the view that coro￾nary artery stenting does indeed alter the systemic expres￾sion of inflammatory markers. hs-CRP concentration peaked 
24 h after stenting and returned to baseline in the 1st week 
in both SIR-G and CONT-G. Although a difference between 
groups was not observed during follow-up in the repeated 
measures model, in the ANCOVA model we observed a trend 
toward greater reduction in SIR-G, which became significant 
at week 4 and lost significance at week 8, after treatment 
discontinuation. Attenuation of the hs-CRP rise after PCI 
has been reported with systemic drugs such as statins (19), 
clopidogrel (20), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors 
(21), and abciximab (22). Sirolimus and paclitaxel-eluting 
stents may also reduce hs-CRP concentration following 
PCI through local drug delivery (23). 
IL-2sRα is considered to be a marker of lymphocyte 
activation (24) and may be elevated in stable (25) and 
unstable angina (26). ICAM-1 is elevated in stable athero￾sclerosis (27) and predicts rapid atherosclerosis progres￾sion (28). Despite these facts, no interaction between time 
and treatment was seen here in either group. However, 
contrary to what was expected, given that SIR-G patients 
were at higher risk for restenosis, ICAM-1 concentrations 
were significantly lower in SIR-G at all times. Besides, the 
ANCOVA model revealed significant differences for the 
variations in the presence of sirolimus treatment and no 
difference after its discontinuation, a pattern similar to that 
of hs-CRP. Therefore, a reduction of ICAM-1 levels by oral 
sirolimus seems plausible. Sirolimus reduces the expres￾sion of ICAMs and other adhesion molecules present in 
endothelial cells (29) and suppresses the proinflammatory 
and pro-adhesive gene expression seen after angioplasty 
in animal models (30). Some differences were seen in 
IL-2sRα after adjustment, but apparently they were not 
correlated with treatment.
P-selectin is an adhesion molecule that is elevated 
in acute coronary syndromes (31). Its inhibition reduces 
neointima formation in rats submitted to balloon angioplasty 
(32). In the present study, P-selectin levels exhibited a 
remarkably greater increase at 8 weeks in SIR-G. Such 
increase was evident in ANCOVA and was corroborated 
by a trend towards an increase in the repeated measures 
model at the same time. This elevation took place after 
sirolimus discontinuation, suggesting a suppressive effect 
of this drug on P-selectin expression. Sirolimus has been 
shown to reduce the expression of P-selectin in human cell 
cultures (28). Although clopidogrel pretreatment reduces 
the levels of P-selectin after PCI (33), the hypothesis that 
clopidogrel discontinuation after 4 weeks could have caused 
P-selectin levels to rise is unlikely, because a significant 
change in P-selectin variation was not observed in CONT￾G at week 8.
MMPs play important roles in biological processes 
involving extracellular matrix turnover or repair, including 
restenosis (34,35). Sirolimus is known to inhibit the activity 
of genes associated with extracellular matrix production 
(36). In the present study, we observed a progressive fall 
in the serum levels of MMP-9 after coronary stenting in 
SIR-G and 4 weeks after sirolimus discontinuation, serum 
levels of MMP-9 were similar to that observed before stent 
implantation. In turn, serum MMP-9 concentration increased 
continuously in CONT-G. MMP-9 is an independent risk fac￾tor for ISR, and multiple ISR sites have a stronger correlation 
with higher serum levels of MMP-9 than a single ISR site 
or no ISR (37). In contrast, serum MMP-2 concentrations 
increased in SIR-G, with the greatest variation at 4 weeks, 
when there was a significant difference between the two 
groups. These findings are consistent with data reported 
by Ge et al. (38) indicating that serum levels of MMP-9 but 
not MMP-2 correlate positively with angiographic late lumen 
loss six months after stenting. Therefore, MMP-9 levels after 
PCI could serve as a marker of the anti-restenotic action 
of systemic sirolimus and other antiproliferative drugs. On 
the other hand, the inhibition of MMP-9 activity, which has 
been associated with decreased migration of smooth muscle 
cells to the intima after balloon angioplasty in animal models 
(39), could be an important component of the anti-restenotic 
action of sirolimus. However, to our knowledge, there have 
been no reports of such an action by sirolimus.
Serum MCP-1 and TIMP-1 did not differ between groups 
except for the variation in MCP-1 at 24 h. MCP-1 elevation 
after PCI has been reported to be independently associated 
with restenosis (40).
The main limitations of the present study are the small 
sample size, large intragroup variation in biomarker con￾centrations and the differences in risk profile between the 
two treatment groups evaluated. Especially for hs-CRP, 
MMP-9, ICAM-1, and P-selectin, a randomized study with 
less variability between groups will be necessary to confirm 
our findings. Also, it is not clear whether the present results

would be maintained if drug regimens with lower doses 
or a shorter course were used, as employed by previous 
investigators (13,15).
In conclusion, when analyzing the systemic inflammatory 
response to coronary stenting in humans, a reduction of 
MMP-9 concentration was evident with oral sirolimus. The 
fact that MMP-9 concentration increased again 4 weeks 
after discontinuation of sirolimus suggests that the drug was 
responsible for the decrease in MMP-9 levels. The marked 
rise of P-selectin following discontinuation of sirolimus and 
the consistently lower concentration of ICAM-1 in the group 
treated with oral sirolimus strongly suggest a drug-related 
suppression of these two biomarkers. The possibility of the 
suppression of hs-CRP by oral sirolimus cannot be ruled 
out. This leads to the hypothesis that the mechanism of 
inhibition of in-stent restenosis by oral sirolimus combines 
anti-proliferative effects and modulation of the inflammatory 
response to PCI, with the latter being achieved through a 
reduction in the expression of adhesion molecules that are 
important for the inflammatory process.
