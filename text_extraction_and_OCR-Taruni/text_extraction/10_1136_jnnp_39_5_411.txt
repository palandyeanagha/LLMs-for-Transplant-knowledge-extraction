SYNOPSIS A subacutely progressive dialytic encephalopathy lasting for three to 15 months in 11
patients who had been on haemodialysis for 14 to 36 months was characterized by dementia,
language disorder, myoclonic jerks, behavioural disturbance, distinctive EEG abnormalities, and
normal or nonspecific neuropathological findings.
Since the introduction of successful extra￾corporeal dialysis by Kolf and Berk (1966) and
maintenance haemodialysis by Scribner et al.
(1960), the prognosis in terms of longevity for
patients with the end stage renal failure has
improved considerably. Parallel improvement
after maintenance haemodialysis in metabolic
derangements and the clinical manifestations
has been gratifying for patients, who were
destined to die within a short period of irrever￾sible and inexorably progressive renal failure
in the pre-dialysis era. However, it soon be￾came apparent that long-term haemodialysis
had its own hazards. Complications (Tyler,
1965; Hampers and Schupak, 1967; Talalla et
al., 1970; Bluemle, 1971; Lindner et al., 1974)
related to the technical aspects of dialysis￾metabolic bone disease, anaemia, haemosider￾osis, pulmonary embolism, pericarditis, cardio￾megaly, psychological problems, accelerated
atherosclerosis, subdural haematoma, and
peripheral neuropathy have all been known.
Dialysis disequilibrium, reverse urea syndrome,
water intoxication, seizures, myoclonus, and
toxic psychosis have been frequently described
as temporary complications of haemodialysis
(Tyler, 1965; Hampers and Schupak, 1967). In
some patients, prolonged confusional state may
persist for days (Tyler, 1965) but eventually

the mental state reverts to the pre-dialytic
stage. Furthermore, some patients in acute
and terminal stage of chronic renal failure and
immediately after dialysis (Tyler, 1965, 1968)
develop confusion, disorientation, and con￾vulsions progressing rapidly to coma and
death. All these complications may be grouped
under the general heading of acute dialytic
encephalopathy (ADE). This paper directs
attention to a less well-documented subacutely
progressive dialytic encephalopathy (PDE)
(Alfrey et al., 1972; Mahurkar et al., 1973;
Burks et al., 1974; Chokroverty et al., 1974).
A characteristic clinical picture accompanied
by distinctive electroencephalographic (EEG)
abnormalities emerged in 11 patients with
chronic renal failure on long-term haemodialy￾sis. Progressive dialytic encephalopathy in these
patients, in contrast to patients with ADE or
uraemic encephalopathy, did not depend either
singly or in combination on rapid electrolyte
shift, alteration of acid base balance, sudden
rise of blood pressure, or increased levels of
blood urea nitrogen or creatinine.
REPORT OF CASES
All patients had been on maintenance haemo￾dialysis using Ex-03 coil or Dow hollow fibre
dialyser three times a week for six hours each
time. The dialysate was made up from commercial
concentrate with non-ionizing tap water.

S. Chokroverty, M. E. Bruetman, V. P. Berger, and M. G. Reyes
CASE 1 A 55 year old woman with chronic
glomerulonephritis had been on a long-term
haemodialysis programme for 18 months. One
month before admission she developed difficulty
in speaking. Examination revealed an oriented
woman with nonfluent speech; her comprehension
was good but she had difficulty in finding the right
words. Additionally, her speech was character￾ized by stuttering, mispronunciation, occasional
anomia, agrammatism, and impairment of repeti￾tion. Her handwriting contained omissions and
misspelling of the words. The rest of the physical
examination was unremarkable. Her speech im￾proved somewhat and she was discharged home
five days later. She was readmitted five months
after discharge with agitated delirium, visual and
auditory hallucinations, and paranoid delusions.
After treatment with sedation and tranquillizers,
her agitation subsided. During the last two weeks
of her life she developed intermittent myoclonic
jerks bilaterally, continued to have paranoid delu￾sions, and remained demented and dysphasic. She
deteriorated progressively and died seven months
after the onset of neurological disability.
CASE 2 A 47 year old woman had end stage renal
disease due to hypertension. She had been on
maintenance haemodialysis for 14 months. In
August 1974 she developed myoclonic jerks in all
four limbs intermittently. At about the same time
she had several transient attacks of nonfluent
dysphasia. In the course of the next three weeks
her speech became normal, myoclonic jerks im￾proved considerably, and she was discharged
home. In October 1974 she was readmitted be￾cause of confusion, agitation, and inability to
speak. Neurological examination revealed marked
agitation, disorientation, and non-fluent dysphasia.
Motor and sensory testing demonstrated normal
findings and muscle stretch reflexes were sym￾metrically present. Her mental status and langu￾age problems showed day-to-day variation. On
6 November 1974 she suddenly had a cardiac
arrest. Despite resuscitative measures she re￾mained deeply comatose and died on 11 Novem￾ber 1974.
CASE 3 (Already published in detail by Mahurkar
et al., 1973). Twenty-seven months after haemo￾dialysis and bilateral nephrectomy, a 51 year old
woman slowly became demented and later demon￾strated grimacing, myoclonic jerks of limbs, dys￾phasia, and dyspraxia. She became progressively
more demented and died three months after the
onset of neurological dysfunction.
CASE 4 A 25 year old man was admitted on 8
July 1974 because of sudden onset of mutism and
intermittent myoclonic jerks of face and limbs
bilaterally for one week. He had been on a haemo￾dialysis programme since July 1971 for chronic
renal failure and hypertension. Examination re￾vealed a cooperative man who was able to under￾stand commands but was completely unable to
talk. There was lingual dyspraxia. His handwrit￾ing, both spontaneously and while copying, dis￾played omissions, misspellings, and perseveration.
The rest of the neurological examination was nor￾mal. In the course of the next 10 days his speech
improved and he was discharged with a mild
stuttering dysarthria. On 28 August 1974 he again
became completely mute and again the speech
improved in the course of the next 12 days. On
16 September 1974 he had a violent myoclonic
jerk which caused him to fall. Since then he had
been having intermittent myoclonic jerks of all
four limbs. In January 1975, myoclonic jerks be￾came more frequent and he was unable to talk,
although he tried to open his mouth and was able
to follow commands by mimicry. Two days later
his speech returned spontaneously, myoclonic
jerks became less frequent, and he was discharged
home. He was readmitted on 5 May 1975 because
of progressively increasing dementia, myoclonic
jerks, agitation, and delusions. On 16 May 1975,
after a sudden episode of hypotension, he died.
CASE 5 A 46 year old man, who had long-term
haemodialysis for chronic renal failure for 34
months, was admitted because of sudden inability
to talk. In the course of the next three days his
speech returned but he was noted to have non￾fluent dysphasia. His writing displayed persevera￾tion, omission, and misspelling of words. The
language problem would show periodic exacerba￾tion and remission. Three months after the onset
of the neurological illness while having haemo￾dialysis he had a transient episode of auditory
hallucination. Seven months after the onset of his
speech difficulties, he developed intermittent myo￾clonic jerks bilaterally which were made worse by
noise. He became progressively demented and
incontinent of urine and faeces. He would respond
to loud noises, light flashes, and pinching by
bilateral myoclonic jerks. He died six months after
the onset of the neurological dysfunction.
CASE 6 A 43 year old woman had been on main￾tenance haemodialysis for hypertension, end stage
kidney disease, and chronic renal insufficiency.
She insidiously developed confusion, disorienta￾412 Protected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies.

tion, impairment of memory, and 'abnormal be￾haviour' while on chronic haemodialysis for 18
months. Her mental functions would fluctuate and
on some days she showed remarkable improve￾ment. However, in the course of the next three
months she developed myoclonic jerks of all four
limbs intermittently and apraxia of gait. She be￾came progressively more demented and died six
months after the onset of dementia.
CASE 7 Thirty-five months after long-term
haemodialysis for chronic renal failure, a 44 year
old woman developed myoclonic seizures. Perti￾nent neurological findings consisted of diffuse
myoclonic jerks and left homonymous hemianop￾sia. Three months later she displayed intermittent
confusion. Seven months after the onset of myo￾clonic seizures, she suddenly became mute. she
was able to comprehend and follow commands
but was unable to speak or write. Her mutism was
gradually replaced by dysphasia which was charac￾terized by inability to find the right words,
hesitancy of speech, perseveration, and agramma￾tism. Subsequently, she developed 'bizarre' be￾haviour. She became agitated and pulled out her
hair and eyebrows. Her mental functions pro￾gressively deteriorated and she died seven months
after the onset of the myoclonic seizures.
CASE 8 After haemodialysis for 15 months for
chronic renal failure, a 30 year old woman
developed impairment of memory and bilateral
myoclonic seizures. Two weeks later she began to
act in a strange manner and displayed delusion of
persecution, auditory hallucination, disorientation,
and inappropriate affect. Her behaviour improved
somewhat but she remained severely demented,
continued to have intermittent bilateral myoclonic
seizures, and died three months after the onset of
the neurological illness.
CASE 9 A 46 year old man had been on long-term
haemodialysis for three years for chronic glo￾merulonephritis and renal failure. A renal trans￾plantation was unsuccessful because of rejection.
He gradually developed impairment of memory,
intermittent confusion, disorientation, hallucina￾tions, delusions, and periodic attacks of 'bizarre'
behaviour. Six to seven months after the onset of
behavioural and memory disturbance he began
intermittently to have frequent generalized tonic￾clonic seizures and bilateral myoclonic jerks. He
later suddenly became dysphasic. He could com￾prehend well but was unable to read, write, or
repeat words. His speech improved in the course
of the next few days but his mental functions con￾tinued to deteriorate, myoclonic seizures became
more frequent, and he died 15 months after the
onset of dementia and 'bizarre' behaviour.
CASE 10 After haemodialysis for 15 months, a
43 year old woman presented with 'bizarre' be￾haviour, disorientation, impairment of memory,
and paranoid delusions. She had had multiple
hospital admissions for periodic exacerbations of
agitated delirium, hallucinations, and paranoid
delusions. Subsequently, she developed bilateral
myoclonic seizures, dysphasia, and dyspraxia and
died in status epilepticus three months after the
onset of the neurological dysfunction.
CASE 11 A 40 year old woman had been on
chronic haemodialysis for hypertension and renal
failure since March 1971. In December 1973, dur￾ing haemodialysis, she had a transient loss of con￾sciousness and twitching of the mouth and had
bitten her tongue. After this episode, her mental
functions progressively became impaired. In
March 1974, she was admitted in a mute state. She
could not follow written commands, could not
write, but was alert and able to mimic well. Ad￾ditional pertinent neurological findings included
foot grasp, snout reflex, and diminished ankle
jerks bilaterally. While in the hospital she devel￾oped bilateral myoclonic jerks. Her spontaneous
speech had returned one or two days after
admission but her speech and writing were charac￾terized by perseveration, hesitancy, misspelling,
and omission of words. She also had right-left dis￾orientation and dyscalculia. On the fourth hospi￾tal day she suddenly became very agitated and
started shouting that someone was trying to kill
her. Her paranoid delusions and agitation per￾sisted and she suddenly died on the sixth hospital
day.
LABORATORY DATA In nine patients the range of
values for blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine,
sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphorus and albu￾min, and blood pH during one year before the
onset of PDE and during the period of neurologi￾cal dysfunction did not show any significant over￾all changes. Except for slightly low protein in
cases 5-7, the cerebrospinal fluid, examined in
seven patients, was normal. Brain scan (cases 1, 2,
10), cisternal scan (cases 2, 6, 8, 9), cerebral angio￾gram (case lI) and pneumoencephalogram (case 9)
gave normal results.

or 16-channel electroencephalograph, using the
International 10-20 electrode placement system.
During some portion of the recording, EEG re￾sponses after clapping, pinching of the extremi￾ties, and eye opening and closing were noted. The
EEG findings are summarized in Table 1. The
dominant EEG rhythm consisted of 8-10 Hz
activity in all except cases 5 and 7. An excessive
amount of theta rhythm was present in six
patients (cases 2, 4-8). All patients demonstrated
bisynchronous, mostly anteriorly dominant, inter￾mittent rhythmic delta waves in the majority of
the tracings (Fig. 1). The second most common
EEG manifestation was the presence of fronto￾central spike-and-slow wave complexes in a bi￾laterally synchronous fashion (Fig. 2). These
epileptiform activities were present predominantly
on the left side in case 5, on the right in case 7,
and more or less symmetrically in the remaining
cases. Photic stimulation (cases 3-6, 9, 11) acti￾vated the epileptiform activities in four patients
(cases 3-5, 9). Two patients (cases 2 and 5) demon￾TABLE 1

multiple lacunae were noted bilaterally in the dor￾somedial, ventral, and the right reticular nucleus
of the thalamus, caudate nucleus, putamen, and
the right insular cortex. In addition, there were
anoxic-ischaemic changes in the cerebral, cere￾bellar, and subcortical neurones.

DISCUSSION
CLINICAL ANALYSIS An analysis of the clinical
features in these 11 patients revealed that the
major manifestations of PDE can be grouped
under four headings: (1) dementia; (2) lan￾guage disorders; (3) myoclonic jerks, and (4)
behavioural disturbances. These four features,
the PDE tetrad, were present in seven patients
(cases 1, 2, 4, 7, 9-11). Three manifestations of
the tetrad were present in all patients, and
therefore we believe that the term 'progressive
dialytic encephalopathy' describes the entity
more appropriately than the term 'dialysis
dementia'. One notable feature was the peri￾odic fluctuation but always inexorable pro￾gression of the disease.
DEMENTIA This symptom was present in all
patients. The main manifestations in these
patients were confusion, disorientation, im￾pairment of memory, and later behavioural
disturbances. Progressive dialytic encephalo￾pathy began with dementia in six patients
(cases 3, 6, 8-11). Patient 4 developed demen￾tia terminally.
LANGUAGE DISORDER This was characterized
by mutism or global dysphasia with dominant
difficulty in expression. Language dysfunction
was the principal feature at the onset of PDE
in four patients (cases 1, 2, 4, 5) and was
present in course of the illness in all patients
except in cases 6 and 8.
MYOCLONIC JERKS These were noted in all
patients in the course of PDE and were the
principal manifestations in the beginning of

Progressive dialytic encephalopathy
the illness in four patients (cases 2, 4, 7, 8).
Myoclonic jerks were present bilaterally and
sometimes were stimulus sensitive.
BEHAVIOURAL DISTURBANCES These symptoms
were characterized by agitation, delirium,
paranoid delusions, hallucinations, and some￾times by 'bizarre' behaviour. These were
present in all patients and were the major
manifestations at the onset of PDE in four
patients (cases 6, 8-10).
In the initial period of our study (Chokro￾verty et al., 1974), it appeared that PDE pro￾bably progressed through three distinct stages.
However, as more and more patients were ob￾served over a period of time, we could not
confirm our original impression as PDE mani￾fested itself with the aforementioned tetrad in
varying combination without passing through
any distinct clinical stages. In our series, PDE
began 14 to 36 months after maintenance
haemodialysis and lasted from three to 15
months.
It is obvious from the above clinical analysis
that any or all of the PDE tetrad may be
present in uraemic encephalopathy in addition
to focal sensory-motor deficits or seizures.
However, there are distinct differences be￾tween the manifestations of PDE and uraemic
encephalopathy and these are summarized in
Table 2. According to Curtis et al. (1969), two
to three periods of haemodialysis each week
may not achieve the normal renal regulatory
functions and, despite maintenance haemo￾dialysis, these patients continue in a state of
uraemia. Therefore, progressive dialytic en￾cephalopathy would appear to be a variant of
uraemic encephalopathy but with an altered
course and related in some as yet unknown
way to maintenance haemodialysis. Whether
by increasing the frequency of dialysis the out￾come of PDE could be altered or the patients
became truly refractory to dialysis cannot be
determined from our study. However, Burks
et al. (1974) stated that more frequent dialysis did not alter the clinical course in their
patients.
ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY Normal or mild￾to-moderate slowing of the background EEG
activity intermixed with frontally dominant
intermittent rhythmic bisynchronous delta
waves and frontocentral epileptic-type activi￾ties in patients with PDE were not specific but
were characteristically noted in all patients during some stage of the illness. Similar EEG
changes are known to occur in patients with
uraemic or other metabolic encephalopathies
(Cadilhac and Ribstein, 1961) and most pro- bably indicate functional derangement of cor￾tical and reticulocortical neurones. However,
we did not observe appropriate anatomical
alterations to account for dysfunction of cor￾tical and reticulocortical neurones on neuro￾pathological examination of the brain.
NEUROPATHOLOGICAL ASPECTS A survey of the
literature reveals that the neuropathological
changes in uraemic brain (Olsen, 1961) consist
in variable combinations of neuronal degenera￾TABLE 2

tion, foci of softening, astrocytic proliferation,
vascular damage, petechiae, focal demyelina￾tion, cerebral oedema, toxic encephalitis, and
necrosis of the granular layer of the cerebellar
cortex. We found none of these changes in our
patients except lacunae in the basal ganglia
and thalamus in cases 2, 3, and 11. These
lacunar infarcts cannot be responsible for the
PDE tetrad and the EEG findings. Therefore,
a marked disparity between the clinical and the
neuropathological observations is very charac￾teristic of the entity of PDE.
PATHOGENESIS Absence of morphological cor￾relates for the clinical observations would tend
to favour a possible metabolic cerebral dys￾function. However, as stated previously, there
were no overall changes in the systemic bio￾chemical parameters from the values noted
before the onset of PDE. Therefore, it is prob￾lematical to ascribe the neurological illness to
metabolic encephalopathy caused by altered
systemic metabolism but there may be a pos￾sible relationship between PDE and uraemic
encephalopathy as discussed above in the
clinical analysis.
The group of investigators from Colorado
(Alfrey et al., 1972; Burks et al., 1974) noted
a high concentration of tin and decreased
rubidium in the brains of seven patients with
progressive dialytic encephalopathy. As there
is no evidence of a significant role for rubidium
in human health, these workers suggested
tin as a possible aetiological factor in this
type of encephalopathy. Although tin is known
to cause an encephalopathy in animals and
man (Torack et al., 1960; Alajouanine et al.,
1958; Prull and Romple, 1970), the charac￾teristic PDE tetrad, the distinctive EEG
changes, absence of cerebral oedema (Torack
et al., 1960) in our patients, the observations
of high tin content in uraemic patients with￾out encephalopathy (Alfrey et al., 1972), and
the normal concentration of tin in the brain
of at least one of our patients (Chokroverty
et al., 1974) would speak against tin as an
aetiological factor in PDE.
Finally, suggestion of possible dopamine
(Wardle, 1973) or asparagine (Gunale, 1973)
deficiency or any other cerebral neurochemical
defect in PDE is pure speculation but may
form a theoretical basis for a future line of
investigation. At present, the aetiology of
progressive dialytic encephalopathy remains
unknown.
