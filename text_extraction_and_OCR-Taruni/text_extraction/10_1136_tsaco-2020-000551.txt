ABSTRACT
The management of complex liver injury has changed 
during the last 30 years. Operative management has 
evolved into a non-operative management (NOM) 
approach, with surgery reserved for those who present in 
extremis or become hemodynamically unstable despite 
resuscitation. This NOM approach has been associated 
with improved survival rates in severe liver injury and 
has been the mainstay of treatment for the last 20 years. 
Patients that fail NOM and require emergency surgery 
are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. 
Better patient selection may have an impact not only 
on the rate of failure of NOM, but the mortality rate 
associated with it. The aim of this article is to review the 
evidence that helped shape the evolution of liver injury 
management during the last 30 years.
Until the start of the 20th century the manage￾ment of severe abdominal injury was expectant and 
this approach was associated with extremely high 
mortality.1
 Pringle’s2
 seminal monograph published 
in 1908 describes the serious consequences resulting 
from trauma to the liver, noting that “Rupture of 
the liver is fortunately an accident not often met 
with, but one which, when it is seen, may be associ￾ated with a condition as serious as anyone can meet 
within surgical practice.” Moore et al3
 described 
a 6-year review of operative results (1972–1978) 
that showed 9% of their patients with severe liver 
injuries had been managed with formal hepatic 
lobectomy, a technique that carried a mortality 
rate of 70%. High mortality rates for operative 
intervention stimulated Moore et al’s3
 interest in 
management options other than formal resection 
and described that throughout the study period 
there had been a transition away from operative 
to conservative management. Other authors were 
also reporting similar devastating rates of operative 
mortality in the late 1970s and early 1980s.4–6
The successful non-operative management 
(NOM) of liver injuries had already been suggested 
in the animal experiments performed by Tellman 
in 18797
 and the clinical experiences of J William 
Hinton8
, who in 1929 said: “In ruptures of the 
liver conservative treatment is more desirable 
than an exploratory laparotomy, as surgery is of 
no avail in ruptures of the liver, for usually the 
haemorrhage has stopped and is started again by 
the surgical intervention.” The first clinical appli￾cation of NOM in hepatic trauma was described 
in children in 1986. Oldham et al9
 studied 188 
consecutive pediatric patients with serious injuries. 
Liver injuries were identified on CT in 53 of these, 
with 92% (49 patients) being treated successfully 
with NOM. The study demonstrated that the vast 
majority of pediatric blunt liver trauma patients 
could undergo NOM safely.9
 During the next few 
years, several authors demonstrated the validity of 
a NOM approach in pediatric patients.10–13
The concept of NOM in adults remained 
controversial in the 1980s, with concerns being 
raised regarding the unknown natural history of 
non-surgically treated hepatic trauma, inaccuracy 
of CT interpretation, and the inherent delays in 
examination.14 One of the first studies to use CT 
in adult patients for NOM of blunt liver injuries 
was published by Meyer et al in 1985.15 They 
studied 24 patients during a 2.5-year period and 
used CT to assess the degree of injury and whether 
NOM was suitable. Of the 24 patients, 14 were 
discharged 4 to 8 days after their injury, with 4 
patients discharged within 96hours. None of the 24 
patients required surgery or suffered any compli￾cations. The authors concluded that patients with 
minor injuries could be managed safely with NOM, 
but that “the treatment of most liver injuries is 
surgical, and that NOM is not an acceptable alter￾native.” The authors recommended several criteria 
when considering NOM of liver trauma using CT 
assessment, including hemodynamic stability, good 
quality scans with accurate interpretation, senior 
surgical decision making, appropriate critical care 
facilities, and the personnel to perform emergency 
surgery if required.15
In agreement with this view, Farnell et al14
described the management of 66 consecutive 
blunt hepatic trauma patients at the Mayo Clinic 
between 1981 and 1987. Of the 66 patients, 46 
were operated on immediately due to hypovo￾lemic shock, with 20 stable patients undergoing 
CT scan. A NOM approach was taken in patients 
with hemodynamic stability and findings on CT 
of either contained capsular hematoma, unilobar 
fracture, minimal hemoperitoneum with no other 
intra-abdominal injuries, and an absence of devital￾ized liver. Of the 46 patients operated on, 14 died 
(30%). Of the 20 patients in the NOM group, 3 
went on to require surgery due to instability. The 
other 17 patients all recovered from their injury 
without complication. The NOM group had signifi￾cantly shorter length of hospital stay, fewer days 
in intensive care, and less blood transfusion in the 
first 24hours and in total.14 However, patients in 
the NOM group also had significantly lower Injury 
Severity Score than their operative management

counterparts with significantly less deranged clinical parameters 
on presentation.
In the 1990s several studies began evaluating NOM as the 
primary treatment strategy in cases of severe liver injury. In 
1994, Meredith et al16 examined 126 patients presenting with 
blunt hepatic trauma to a level 1 trauma center in North Caro￾lina during a 36-month period under a NOM protocol. Of these, 
24 required immediate surgery due to hemodynamic instability 
and 10 died of extra-abdominal injuries. A total of 92 patients 
underwent CT scanning. Of these, 20 required surgery for subse￾quent hemodynamic instability and the remaining 72 patients 
were intentionally treated with NOM, of whom 70 (97%) were 
successful. None of the 31 patients with American Association 
for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) grade III to V liver injuries 
failed NOM. The overall mortality for grade III, IV, and V injured 
patients was 16%, 13%, and 29%, respectively. However, the 
mortality in the 17 patients with grade III to V injuries who were 
treated surgically for their liver injury was 47%. The authors 
concluded that NOM was the preferable management option for 
approximately half of their patients that presented with blunt 
liver trauma and for the significant majority who had liver inju￾ries that were hemodynamically stable enough to undergo CT 
scanning.
One of the first prospective studies to evaluate NOM strat￾egies in complex liver trauma was Croce et al17 in 1995. The 
authors prospectively evaluated 134 patients with blunt hepatic 
trauma during a 22-month period, with the aim to establish 
whether NOM was feasible for all grades of blunt hepatic injury 
and whether there were any physiological or anatomic factors 
that could predict who would require surgery. Unstable patients 
underwent immediate laparotomy, as did patients with non￾hepatic injuries that required exploration. All patients in the 
study that were considered hemodynamically stable underwent 
CT scanning and were managed conservatively in the inten￾sive care unit. The 112 patients who were selected for NOM 
covered the full spectrum of AAST grading. The NOM group 
was compared with a group consisting of 168 patients with blunt 
liver injuries who were previously prospectively studied.18 Of 
these, 84 (50%) were matched to the NOM group according to 
injury severity. Liver injuries were grouped into AAST grade I 
and II and AAST grade III to V. In the subgroups of patients with 
minor liver injury, the mortality for the NOM cohort was 10% 
and for the control cohort 6%. Neither group had any deaths 
related to liver injury or complications. The authors concluded 
that 89% of all patients with blunt liver injury that are hemody￾namically stable at presentation can be managed without surgery 
and that NOM should be the treatment of choice. Several single￾institution studies reported high success rates of NOM in patients 
with severe blunt hepatic trauma in the same period.14 16 19–22
Moreover, two large studies of NOM were described.23 24
Pachter et al23 undertook a multicenter study to assess whether 
the combined experiences at level 1 trauma centers could validate 
the reported high success rate and low morbidity and mortality 
associated with NOM. Thirteen level 1 trauma centers accrued 
404 adult patients sustaining blunt hepatic injuries treated with 
NOM during a 5-year period. Hemodynamic stability was the 
major inclusion criterion for the NOM group. Once this was 
established, the other criteria consisted of the absence of peri￾toneal signs in a neurological intact and unimpaired patient, CT 
scanning and AAST injury assessment, an absence of concurrent 
intra-abdominal or retroperitoneal injury requiring immediate 
surgical intervention, and no requirement of ongoing liver￾related blood transfusions. There were 27 deaths (7%) in this 
series, with 16 directly related to head trauma. Only two deaths 
(0.4%) were attributed to hepatic injury. Twenty-one patients 
(5%) had complications, with the most common being bleeding, 
occurring in 14 (3.5%). Overall, six patients required operative 
intervention: three for hemorrhage, two for missed enteric inju￾ries, and one for persistent sepsis after unsuccessful percutaneous 
drainage. Overall 98.5% of patients in this study successfully 
completed NOM. Then, Richardson et al24 published a land￾mark review in 2000, looking at the evolution in the manage￾ment of hepatic trauma during a 25-year period, in particularly 
focusing on the impact of treatment changes on outcomes. 
The authors conducted a retrospective review of 1842 patients 
treated at the University of Louisville Trauma Unit between 1975 
and 1999. They described that, although there was an increase 
in the number of liver injuries and a steady number of high￾grade injuries seen, the actual number of operations performed 
for major hepatic venous injuries reduced by over 50% in the 
final 5 years of the study compared with the previous study 
periods. This correlated with an improvement in survival from 
major hepatic venous injuries. The authors contended that many 
venous injuries heal without surgical intervention due to their 
low pressure nature, and that manipulation of these is liable to 
cause massive, uncontrollable bleeding and therefore are better 
treated with NOM.24
Malhotra et al25 published data that compared the outcomes 
of a cohort of 661 blunt hepatic trauma patients from 1993 
to 1998 (NONOP2 group) with a cohort of 168 consecutive 
patients admitted between November 1985 and October 1990 
who underwent surgery (OP group) for their liver injury and 
a second cohort of 136 consecutive patients admitted between 
January 1993 and October 1994 who were all treated with 
NOM (NONOP1 group). In the NONOP2 group, 101 patients 
required immediate surgery, with the most common indication 
being hemodynamic instability, and 42 (7.5%) failed NOM, 20 
due to liver-related problems. Overall 85% were treated with 
NOM with a 92.5% success rate. The rate of serious infections 
and transfusion requirements (both during the first 24hours 
and in total) were lower in the NONOP2 group. There was also 
a significant difference in the length of hospital stay between 
the groups. The OP cohort had an average length of stay of 
20.4 days, with the NONOP1 group and the NONOP2 group 
having an average of 18.3 days and 12.7 days, respectively. 
The combined mortality for all three cohorts in this study was 
15%, with liver-specific mortality being identical across all three 
cohorts (4%). Of the 25 deaths from liver injury, 23 occurred in 
patients with grade IV, V and VI injuries that required immediate 
emergency surgery. The similar liver-related mortality across all 
three cohorts gave a strong indication that using NOM to treat 
even high-grade liver injuries was a safe approach in hemody￾namically stable patients.
A 2006 study by Coimbra et al26 described NOM as the “treat￾ment of choice for stable patients sustaining blunt liver injury.” 
The authors produced a 15-year retrospective review of 128 
consecutive patients with grade III and IV liver injuries, with 
27 being treated conservatively. The study showed that the 
operative mortality of grade III and grade IV injuries remained 
unchanged between 1985 and 1993 (33.3%) and between 1994 
and 1999 (28.6%), whereas the mortality of patients treated 
non-operatively was 0%. The authors observed a 23.5% reduc￾tion in mortality since the introduction of their NOM protocol. 
Coimbra et al26 discussed that the key to successful NOM was 
careful patient selection. They also commented that the classic 
criteria for choosing NOM of hemodynamic stability, normal 
neurological status, an absence of a clear indication for lapa￾rotomy, low grade (AAST I–II) injury, and the requirement for

no more than two units of blood had been challenged in that no 
single criterion can predict who will fail NOM, and hemody￾namic stability of the only necessity for its use.
Since Richardson et al’s24 review in 2000, advances in CT 
scanning and access to angiography and embolization techniques 
undoubtedly have improved the outcome of severely injured 
trauma patients.27 28 However, mortality rates for high-grade 
liver injuries were still significant, invariably due to the fact that 
the patient frequently presented with profound acidosis, hypo￾thermia, and coagulopathy.29 In 2007, Asensio et al30 published a 
54-month prospective study specifically focusing on the manage￾ment of 75 patients with AAST grade IV and V liver injuries, 
and whether a multidisciplinary approach improved outcomes. 
Of the 75 patients, 52 (69%) had grade IV injuries, with the 
remaining 23 having grade V injury. In total 23 patients died 
(31% mortality), of whom 18 died from intraoperative hemor￾rhage. The mortality rates among patients with grade IV and V 
injuries were 19% and 57%, respectively. This compared favor￾ably with other series by Cogbill et al,
31 who described a 46% 
mortality rate for grade IV and 80% mortality rate for grade V 
injuries, and an earlier study by Asensio et al27, where mortality 
rate for grade IV injuries was 47% and for grade V injuries 77%.
A 2012 study by van der Wilden et al32 retrospectively reviewed 
the role of hepatic angiography and embolization in 393 high￾grade (AAST grade IV and V) liver injuries from 11 level 1 and 
2 trauma centers across New England in the USA. The authors’ 
starting hypothesis was that grade IV and V injuries could be 
safely treated with NOM with angiographic embolization as an 
adjunct. Of their patient cohort, 133 (33.3%) underwent imme￾diate emergency surgery due to hemodynamic instability, with 
the other 262 given a trial of NOM. In 23 out of the 262 patients 
NOM failed (8.8%), with 8.1% of grade IV and 14.3% of grade 
V patients requiring delayed surgery. Patients who failed NOM 
had a significantly lower systolic blood pressure at admission, 
required longer stay in the intensive care unit, and had high rates 
of morbidity compared with patients who completed NOM. 
This does question their initial designation as being hemody￾namically stable at admission. Of the patients who successfully 
completed NOM, 79 underwent hepatic angiography (33.1%) 
and 55 received embolization (23%). The authors reported a 
success rate of 93.2% (55 out of 59 patients) for patients under￾going angiography and embolization and attributed a high rate 
of successful NOM to this technique.32
However, the need for angiography and embolization might 
be reduced by improved resuscitation strategies. Gaski et al33
performed a retrospective study of 583 patients with liver inju￾ries cared for at the Oslo University Hospital between 2002 and 
2014. Up to 2008 all patients with high-grade injuries under￾went angiography, which was then adjusted to angiography only 
when signs of significant hemorrhage or contrast extravasation 
were identified on CT. The study therefore compared the period 
before (P1) and after (P2) 2008. There was an increase in the 
proportion of patients selected for NOM between P1 (65%) and 
P2 (76%), with no increase in the NOM failure rate (1% in both 
periods). Overall mortality fell from 14% in P1 to 7% in P2. 
As expected, the 46 patients who underwent laparotomy had 
a high mortality rate (46%), of which 67% were hemorrhage￾related. When specifically comparing the grade IV and V inju￾ries, it was noted that the 83 patients in P2 received significantly 
more plasma in the first 24hours than the 66 patients in P1, 
resulting in a more balanced transfusion ratio. Patients in P2 also 
received significantly lower volume of crystalloid compared with 
P1. Between P1 and P2 there was no difference between 68% 
and 70% NOM rates or NOM failure rates (4% and 0%). There 
was a significant reduction in the number of patients under￾going angiography (68% in P1 compared with 22% in P2), with 
a similar reduction in angioembolization rates (30% vs. 12%). 
Mortality rates in the grade IV and V injury group was 17% 
in P1 and 15% in P2. However, liver-related deaths went from 
11% to 4%.
The study concluded that with improved damage control 
resuscitation (DCR) protocols, NOM is safe in 70% of patients 
with AAST grade IV and V injuries and normal physiology, and 
that this strategy has low failure rates and mortality. Shrestha et 
al34 also showed that improved resuscitation with DCR princi￾ples improved survival rates in severe liver trauma. The authors 
performed a retrospective study of all AAST IV and V injuries, 
dividing them into a pre-DCR group (between 2005 and 2008) 
of 108 patients and a DCR group (between 2009 and 2011) of 
98 patients. The DCR group had an increased success rate of 
NOM, from 54% pre-DCR to 74% in the DCR group, as well 
as significant reduction in transfusion requirements in the first 
24hours and reduction of total crystalloid transfusion during 
the same time period. The implementation of DCR principles 
improved survival rates from 74% to 94% during the two time 
periods.
The increasing diagnostic sensitivity of whole body CT in 
trauma has reduced the rate of missed injury considerably, with 
rates reported as low as 2.4%.35 This has allowed the NOM 
management of isolated liver injury to be undertaken with 
increasing confidence. In parallel to this, improvements in inter￾ventional radiology techniques mean that many complications of 
liver trauma related to hemorrhage or bile leaks can be success￾fully treated radiologically without the need for open surgery.36
Biliary peritonitis has traditionally been treated with laparotomy; 
however, percutaneous drainage may be combined with endobi￾liary stent placement as a safe alternative when necessary.37 Since 
even severe liver injuries can undergo NOM with a high degree 
of safety, contemporary treatment strategies should reflect the 
importance of patient physiology and associated injuries more 
than liver injury grade.38 However, mortality remains obstinately 
high in patients with grade IV and V injuries who are critically ill 
at admission, and it is this population that requires further study 
to improve their outcomes.33 34
