ABSTRACT
A multidisciplinary panel of 18 physicians and 3 non￾physicians from eight countries (Sweden, UK, Argentina,
Australia, Italy, Finland, Norway and the USA) reviewed
the literature on diagnosis and management of adult
coeliac disease (CD). This paper presents the
recommendations of the British Society of
Gastroenterology. Areas of controversies were explored
through phone meetings and web surveys. Nine working
groups examined the following areas of CD diagnosis
and management: classification of CD; genetics and
immunology; diagnostics; serology and endoscopy;
follow-up; gluten-free diet; refractory CD and
malignancies; quality of life; novel treatments; patient
support; and screening for CD.
INTRODUCTION
Objective
The aim was to create updated guidelines for the
management of adult coeliac disease (CD), but
non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) was not
considered.
Development of the guidelines
The British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG)
guidelines on the management of adult CD were
originally published in 1996. Recently the
European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology,
Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) published
updated guidelines for paediatric CD,1 but inter￾national guidelines for adult CD are scarce2–5 since
the NIH consensus6 on CD in 2005 (despite more
than 4000 PubMed publications about CD in the
last 8 years). As a result, the Clinical Services and
Standards Committee of the BSG commissioned
these guidelines, subject to rigorous peer review
and based on a comprehensive review of the recent
literature, including data from any available rando￾mised controlled trials, systematic reviews,
meta-analyses, cohort studies, prospective and
retrospective studies.
A multidisciplinary panel of 18 physicians from
eight countries (Sweden, UK, Argentina, Australia,
Italy, Finland, Norway and the USA), a dietitian
and a representative and a patient advocate from
Coeliac UK reviewed the literature on the manage￾ment of CD. These individuals were involved in
the original stakeholder meetings and with revision
of the manuscript.
Intent and levels of evidence
All aspects of the contemporary diagnosis and man￾agement of patients with adult CD were consid￾ered. PubMed literature was searched from 1900 to
2012 to obtain evidence for these guidelines. Also
there was input from all authors who have consid￾erable expertise and experience in diagnosis and
management of CD. The panel of international
experts previously collaborated in the publication
of definitions of CD7 and were invited by the BSG
through coauthor DSS. Our task force contained
representatives from the clinical disciplines gastro￾enterology, paediatrics, histopathology, neurology,
dermatology, genetics and immunology.
The current literature of review papers was
examined, focusing on 10 reviews8–17 to explore
gaps in current reviews on CD. Nine working sub￾groups were then formed that examined the follow￾ing areas of CD management: classification of CD:
FB, MH, DSS, CC; genetics and immunology:
KEAL, DaVH, PJC; diagnostic criteria, serology
and endoscopy in the investigation of CD: MMW,
JAM, FB, PHRG, JFL, KEAL; follow-up: DAL,
PHRG, JCB, JFL; gluten-free diet (GFD): PJC, KK,
CC, GLS; refractory CD (RCD) and complications:
FZ, FB, DAL, PHRG; quality of life (QoL): GLS,
JCB, TRC, FZ; novel therapy: JCB, KEAL; screen￾ing for CD: TRC, KK, JAM, JFL. The working
groups wrote the sections, which were subsequently
internally reviewed. Each final fully written and
Recommendations
▸ Diagnosis of CD requires duodenal biopsy when
the patient is on a gluten-containing diet and
for the vast majority of adult patients also
positive serology. (Grade B)
▸ Biopsy remains essential for the diagnosis of
adult CD and cannot be replaced by serology.
Follow-up should aim at strict adherence to a
gluten-free diet. (Grade B)

referenced section was then released to all group members for
review by teleconference and email correspondence. Thereafter
JFL created the first draft of the guidelines by amalgamating all
documents. All authors then helped revise this draft until final
document consensus was reached.
Between January 2012 and February 2013, six web surveys
were performed using the web site ‘survey console’ (http://www.
surveyconsole.com) to explore issues including coeliac topics of
controversy; the role of endoscopy; the role of histopathology
and serology in the diagnosis of CD; and follow-up of patients,
including the use of follow-up biopsy. The web surveys were for
the coauthors/Guidelines Development Group (GDG) members.
Survey results were then discussed at teleconference and used to
inform the direction of recommendations and outline areas
where the GDG were not concordant. Disagreements were
solved through discussion.
Studies used as a basis for these guidelines are graded accord￾ing to the quality of evidence using the Oxford Centre for
Evidence-based Medicine levels of evidence.18
Strength of recommendations
A. Directly based on category I evidence, for example, from
systematic reviews and randomised controlled trials. This is
the strongest recommendation of the four grades listed.
B. Directly based on category II or III evidence or extrapolated
recommendation from category I evidence. This includes
evidence from controlled non-randomised studies or time
series; or indirect evidence from systematic reviews or ran￾domised controlled trials.
C. Directly based on category IV evidence or extrapolated rec￾ommendation from category II or III evidence. This also
includes evidence from non-experimental studies such as
cohort studies or case–control studies.
D. Directly based on category V evidence or inconsistent or
inconclusive studies of any level. This includes evidence
from expert committees and respected authorities.
BACKGROUND
CD is an immune-mediated small intestinal enteropathy that is
triggered by exposure to dietary gluten in genetically predis￾posed individuals.7 Samuel Gee is credited with the first clinical
description of CD in 1887, although Aretaeus of Cappadocia
may have described the disease in the first century AD. In the
1930s and 1940s, Dicke demonstrated (then published in
195319) that a wheat-free diet was the key to management. The
discovery of antigliadin antibodies in 1961 was the first non￾invasive serological marker for CD.20
Until the 1980s, CD was considered a rare disease affecting
mainly children (exceptions occurred21), but subsequently has
been shown to occur at any age.22 Although the prevalence seems
to vary considerably (from <0.25%23 to >1%24), a large-scale
screening study in subjects from Finland, Italy, the UK and
Germany found a prevalence of CD of around 1%,25–27 with a
recent US study showing a prevalence of 0.71%.28 CD is more
frequently diagnosed in women than in men with a ratio
between 1.5 and 2,29 but this gender imbalance may vanish
with age and has been absent in some screening studies.30
Traditionally patients with CD presented with malabsorption
dominated by diarrhoea, steatorrhoea, weight loss or failure to
thrive (‘classical CD’),7 but over time the proportion of newly
diagnosed patients with malabsorptive symptoms has
decreased,31 and ‘non-classical CD’
7 and even asymptomatic
CD have gained prominence. Newly diagnosed patients with
CD can present with a wide range of symptoms and signs,
including anaemia,32 vague abdominal symptoms (often similar
to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)33), neuropathy,34 35 ataxia,36
depression,37 short stature,38 osteomalacia and osteoporosis,39
liver disease,40 adverse pregnancy outcomes41 and lymphoma.42
Asymptomatic patients are typically diagnosed through screen￾ing. Screening may be initiated because the individual has a
CD-associated disorder or has symptoms and is a first-degree
relative to a patient with CD.
The diversity of the clinical presentation of CD emphasises
the need for robust diagnostic criteria and careful disease
work-up. It is therefore natural that over the years, several
efforts have been made to define CD,1 7 43–45 and how it
should be managed.8–16 While all these reviews discussed critical
aspects of diagnostics, including the small intestinal biopsy and
serology, there are scant reports discussing the genetic and
immunological background,8–14 the role of human leucocyte
antigen (HLA) testing,11 12 15 16 46 and even fewer have dis￾cussed issues such as QoL11 15 and patient support.15
During our previous review on definitions of CD and related
concepts,7 we realised that there was a need for a consensus
paper on modern management and diagnosis of CD. In this
project, participants of the so-called Oslo group who first con￾vened at the 2011 meeting on CD in Oslo7 collaborated with
representatives of the BSG to write guidelines for the manage￾ment of CD in adults. These guidelines will enable physicians,
dietitian and other healthcare personnel to provide better care
for their patients.
GENETICS, IMMUNOLOGY AND TRIGGER FACTORS
Environmental factors are important in CD and ingestion of
gluten is a prerequisite for the development of CD. Children
breastfed at and beyond gluten introduction may be at lower
risk of developing CD in childhood, although research is not
consistent.47 Conversely, large amounts of gluten or gluten
exposure without ongoing breastfeeding may increase the risk of
future CD.48 49 Gastrointestinal infections, drugs, interferon α
and surgery have also been implicated as trigger factors.47 50 51
The factors leading to the breakdown of tolerance to gluten are
not known, but local pro-inflammatory changes are of para￾mount importance.52
A high prevalence (10%) among first-degree relatives of
patients with CD53 and a greater concordance rate in monozy￾gotic twins (∼75%)54 than in dizygotic twins indicates a strong
genetic component.
CD shows a very strong association with a particular HLA
variant termed HLA-DQ2.5.55 This molecule is encoded by the
DQA1*05:01 and DQB1*02:01 genes in cis configuration on
the DR3 haplotype. Thus most patients are DR3, DQ2 positive.
A smaller subset of patients with CD express a very similar
DQ2.5 molecule encoded by a combination of DR5 and DR7
positive haplotypes, in this situation by the genes in trans pos￾ition. While the proportion of individuals with CD who are
DQ2.5 positive varies in different geographical areas it is gener￾ally ≥90%. The majority of the remaining patients are
HLA-DQ8 positive (DR4, DQ8 haplotype).56
Genome wide association studies have so far identified 40 loci
outside of HLA with genes predisposing to or protecting against
CD.57 58 Most of these genes have immunological functions and
are related to B-cell and T-cell functions. Each of the non-HLA
genes contributes little to genetic risk. With a population preva￾lence of 1% and a heritability of 50%, the 39 non-HLA loci
account for 14% of the genetic variance whereas HLA in com￾parison accounts for 40%.57

The most striking morphological features of the active coeliac
lesion are the infiltration in the epithelium of T-cell receptor α/β
and γ/δ expressing CD8 positive T cells, natural killer cell like T
cells, and the dense population in the lamina propria of plasma
cells and activated antigen presenting cells.59 60 Although
numerically not dominant, CD4 gluten reactive T cells (T-cell
receptor α/β expressing)61 62 are crucial in the pathogenesis of
CD and are not found in people without CD.63–65
The CD4, gluten-specific T cells in the lamina propria invari￾ably recognise gluten presented by the disease-associated
HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 molecules61–65 and recognise gliadin
peptides that have been modified by tissue transglutaminase 2
(TG2). This modification (glutamine to glutamic acid deamida￾tion process) introduces negative charges.66 These modifications
produce peptides that bind with much higher affinity to the
HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 molecules.67 Patients with CD who
are untreated typically have high titres of antibodies against the
endomysium antigen (EMA test), also shown to be the extracel￾lular enzyme tissue TG2.68 On exposure to gluten, plasma cells
produce antibodies to tissue transglutaminase (IgA-TG2)69 and
deamidated gliadin peptides (IgA-DGP70 and IgG-DGP71).
Untreated and treated CD are characterised by an increase in
γ/δ intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), although in treated
disease, the IEL count is close to that in healthy individuals.72
DIAGNOSTICS
Diagnosis of CD is by serology and duodenal biopsy, ideally
with the patient on a normal, that is, gluten-containing diet.
Biopsy remains essential for the diagnosis of adult CD and
cannot be replaced by serology. Exceptions are patients with
coagulation disorders and pregnant women, in whom biopsy
may not be feasible or should be postponed until postpartum.
To state definite diagnosis of CD, villous atrophy is required.
However, lesser degrees of damage (≥25 IELs but no villous
atrophy) combined with positive serology (IgA-EMA, tissue
transglutaminase (TTG) or IgG-DGP) may also represent CD
(‘probable CD’), and in these circumstances a trial with GFD
may be considered to further support the diagnosis of CD. HLA
status may also aid diagnosis. Differential diagnoses of lympho￾cytic duodenosis should be ruled out if there is no response to
GFD (see table 2).
The diagnosis of CD is readily established in those who,
while consuming a gluten-containing diet, have positive serology
and a duodenal biopsy with obvious coeliac histology (increased
intraepithelial lymphocytosis, crypt hyperplasia and villous
atrophy; table 1). These patients can immediately initiate a GFD
with confidence.
CD can also be suspected in patients with mild gastrointes￾tinal symptoms, associated conditions or those at genetic risk.3
Such patients should be investigated initially with serology and
if this is positive (or if there is still a high index of suspicion as
among symptomatic first-degree relatives73), then undergo
upper endoscopy and duodenal biopsies.
However, in some cases the diagnosis of CD may not be
straightforward, for example, patients are already on a GFD and
therefore antibodies are negative, biopsies were not oriented
correctly (this could lead to false-negative or false-positive
villous atrophy) or show solely intraepithelial lymphocytosis
(lymphocytic duodenosis)74 without architectural changes. In
these situations, the patient needs to be maintained on a gluten￾containing diet and further evaluated with additional testing
and, if necessary, referred to a centre or clinician with a specific
interest in CD.
The diagnosis of CD is illustrated in table 1.

transglutaminase antibodies (IgA-TG2, also called a-TTG, TTA)
and/or deamidated antigliadin antibodies (DGP, either IgA or
IgG isotype).7 IgG-TG2 is primarily useful in patients with
known IgA deficiency.75 76
There is continuing debate on the sole use of non-invasive
tests to diagnose CD. Recently ESPGHAN proposed new guide￾lines for the diagnosis of CD in children. It suggests that in
symptomatic paediatric patients1 in whom the IgA-TG2 level
exceeds 10 times the upper limit of normal, EMA antibodies are
positive on a separately taken blood sample, and HLA-DQ2 or
HLA-DQ8 are positive, then biopsies do not need to be per￾formed to confirm the diagnosis of CD.1 In adults, this strategy
has also been proposed77; however, there are very strong argu￾ments for retaining the biopsy as gold standard for the diagnosis
of CD. A recent study from the (UK) National External Quality
Assessment Service centre states that not all commercial
IgA-TG2 kits are reliable and the ESPGHAN guidelines are
therefore not translatable for use in all centres and should not
be used in the UK.78 Also, 2% of patients with CD are IgA defi￾cient (0.2% of the population in general) and as usual serology
tests for IgA-TG2 and EMA are IgA based, this may lead to false
negatives and a reduction in test sensitivity. If patients are
known to be IgA deficient, IgG-TG2 or IgG-DGP antibodies can
be used, or alternatively, such patients should proceed directly
to biopsy.79
A combination of immunoassays offers the best sensitivity if
either a positive IgA-TG2 or IgG-DGP is considered a positive
detection test. The combination of IgG-DGP and IgA-TG2 is
particularly useful as an addition to detection of patients with
CD who are IgA deficient, IgG-DGP was able to detect a few
more IgA-sufficient patients who were missed by IgA-TG2
alone.76
There are now several point-of-care tests commercially avail￾able, which allow both immediacy and the ability to use them in
a physician office/primary care setting. However, there is a rela￾tive paucity of data on the sensitivity and specificity of such tests
by comparison to the gold standard of duodenal biopsy.80 There
is concern regarding the use of these tests as patients may start
on a GFD without a firm diagnosis—which includes biopsy—
and further studies should be performed before considering the
use of these in everyday practice. One study utilising community
health nurses demonstrated a lower than expected sensitivity
for CD.81
Endoscopy in seronegative individuals
The prevalence of seronegative CD is 6–22% of all diagnosed
cases.71 82 83 84 One study also found a high degree of variabil￾ity in EMA values for sensitivity between laboratories,85 and
upper endoscopy is generally well tolerated and safe.86
Individuals of white European, Middle Eastern, North African
or North Indian origin who undergo upper endoscopy for
anaemia, weight loss or diarrhoea should therefore have duo￾denal biopsies performed, irrespective of whether they have had
serology for CD. These features may well indicate that CD or
an alternative mucosal cause of malabsorption is present.87 In

fact, it has been suggested that duodenal biopsy should be con￾sidered in any individual undergoing endoscopy, because CD is
common and has many varied clinical manifestations, including
reflux, a common indication for endoscopy.88
Recommendation
▸ In individuals undergoing an upper endoscopy in whom
laboratory tests or symptoms or endoscopic features suggest
CD, duodenal biopsy should be considered. (Grade C)
Role of HLA in the diagnosis of CD
CD is associated with specific HLA types in virtually all popula￾tions in which this has been tested, and is associated with the
carriage of the gene pairs that encode DQ2.5 and DQ8.46 89
The diagnostic value of HLA genotyping in patients who may
have CD revolves around its high negative predictive value,
meaning that patients who lack the appropriate HLA genotype
pairs described above are very unlikely to have CD.90 However,
the positive predictive value of the HLA genotyping for CD sus￾ceptibility is very low as a large proportion of individuals
without CD carry either HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 (the preva￾lence of DQ2 in the general population varies between 0% and
40% while that of DQ8 varies between 0% and 20% between
countries91). In family screening, DQ2-positive or DQ8-positive
relatives (especially siblings) are at a higher risk of CD,53 92 with
one study suggesting that DQ2 positivity was associated with a
16-fold increased risk of CD among first-degree relatives.53
Specific use of HLA typing
HLA genotyping may be used in patients with suspected CD but
who fail to respond to a GFD. A negative test in this circum￾stance would indicate that patients are highly unlikely to have
CD (<1% of patients with CD are negative for DQ2 and
DQ893) and thus the clinician can direct diagnostic efforts else￾where. HLA typing may similarly be used in patients who are
self-treated on a GFD and never had appropriate testing for CD
before changing their diet. HLA typing may have an adjunctive
role to identifying individuals who are not genetically at risk of
CD and in whom further evaluation for CD is not necessary,
saving a large number of repeated tests for CD in patients who
would otherwise have to undergo testing because they have
symptoms and a first-degree relative with CD.94
Recommendations
▸ HLA typing should be used to rule out CD. A positive DQ2.5
or DQ8 can never confirm the diagnosis. (Grade B)
▸ HLA typing should be used in individuals who are
self-treated on a GFD and never had appropriate testing for
CD before changing their diet. (Grade B)
▸ HLA typing can be used to rule out CD, and minimise future
testing, in high-risk individuals with CD, for example,
first-degree relatives. (Grade B)
Biopsy and endoscopy in CD
There are endoscopic markers of villous atrophy described—
scalloping or reduction of duodenal folds and nodularity—but
these are not sensitive enough to preclude a biopsy,95 and a
normal endoscopic appearance may occur in the presence of
villous atrophy.96–98 Therefore, the endoscopic appearance of
the duodenum should not determine whether biopsy is
performed.
Biopsy of the duodenum for a diagnosis of CD should be per￾formed irrespective of the prior performance of serological
tests, if the patient exhibits symptoms or signs of CD, such as
diarrhoea, weight loss or anaemia. Biopsies can be mounted on
fibre-free paper to aid orientation,99 or alternatively biopsies
could be free floated in formalin. Consultation with the histo￾pathology laboratory is recommended to agree on specimen
presentation.
The villous atrophy may be patchy in CD; hence multiple
biopsies from the bulb and the more distal duodenum are recom￾mended. The taking of at least four biopsy specimens is asso￾ciated with a doubling of the diagnostic rate compared with
patients undergoing a lower number of biopsies (less than
four).100 In patients with persistently positive coeliac serology
but a normal mucosa, repeat small intestinal biopsy should be
considered, including biopsies from the jejunum.101 Video
capsule endoscopy may support a CD diagnosis in this setting.102
A diagnosis of CD has implications for family members, as
overall, around 10% of first-degree relatives53 may be affected
and there could be uncertainty in pursuing this diagnosis in the
family if the index case does not have a definite CD diagnosis.
Within an adult population the patient may have other indica￾tions for an upper endoscopy, for example anaemia, and thus
exclusion of other diseases is essential. Upper endoscopy is gen￾erally well tolerated by adults and, in contrast to children, can
usually be readily performed with mild or even no sedation.
Finally histological appearance of the small intestinal mucosa
may also predict the risk of certain future complications, such as
lymphoma (patients with villous atrophy are at statistically sig￾nificantly higher risk of future lymphoma than patients with a
normal mucosa but positive coeliac serology).103
Nevertheless there are still adult patients who may be unable
or unwilling to undergo an endoscopy. Under these circum￾stances, assessment of the serological assay and/or level of
IgA-TG2 (if 10 times the upper limit of normal), positive DGP/
EMA, or the use of capsule endoscopy may have a supportive
role. The sensitivity of capsule endoscopy to detect CD is
similar to that of conventional endoscopy when combined with
biopsies. However, it is less invasive, with good specificity and
may provide endoscopic images that can then be used to
support the diagnosis of CD in conjunction with positive ser￾ology. This approach may also be taken in equivocal
cases.104 105
Recommendations
▸ The diagnosis of CD requires duodenal biopsy when the
patient is on a gluten-containing diet and for the vast
majority of adult patients also positive serology. (Grade B)
▸ Duodenal biopsy should be retained as the mainstay for the
diagnosis of adult CD and cannot be replaced by serology.
(Grade B)
▸ At endoscopy, if there is suspicion of CD, then at least four
biopsy specimens should be obtained, including a duodenal
bulb biopsy. (Grade C)
▸ In serologically negative patients showing signs of
malabsorption (such as anaemia or diarrhoea) or a family
history of CD, a duodenal biopsy should be considered.
(Grade C)

Histopathology diagnosis of CD
It is important that pathologists and clinicians appreciate that
patients with CD benefit from a GFD regardless of the degree
of damage in the small intestine and that minor degrees of histo￾logical change suggestive of CD should not be ignored.106
Marsh107 described a commonly used classification of this
spectrum. This classification has been modified subsequently by
Oberhuber108 and simplified by Corazza and Villanacci.109
Recently, Rostami and Villanacci110 defined microscopic enteritis
(also called lymphocytic duodenosis,111 lymphocytic enterop￾athy111) and Villanacci et al112 published a practical classification
with a user-friendly checklist for the histology report of CD.
Some clinicians would prefer a descriptive report, and collab￾oration between pathologists and gastroenterologists as to the
content of the report is valuable. It is important that if serology
has not been performed prior to the biopsy, then this must be
carried out by the requesting physician on receipt of a histology
report suggesting a diagnosis of CD. A biopsy finding of villous
atrophy is not specific for CD. Although CD is the commonest
cause of villous atrophy, there are other causes (table 2); for this
reason the addition of coeliac-specific serology seals the diagno￾sis. The biopsies must be properly oriented (usually by an
experienced laboratory technician) as correct orientation is
necessary for assessment of villous height crypt depth ratio
(derived from the well oriented fields of the biopsies) (figure 1).
The following features should be stated in the report:
▸ Number of biopsies (including those from the duodenal
bulb)113 and orientation.
▸ The architectural features (normal, partial, sub-total or total
villous atrophy).
▸ Comment on the content of the lamina propria (in CD these
are lymphocytes, plasma cells and eosinophils, and occasion￾ally neutrophils, but cryptitis and crypt abscesses should
suggest other pathology).
▸ Presence of Brunner’s glands.
▸ Presence of crypt hyperplasia, villous height: crypt depth
ratio (3:1).112 The absence of plasma cells suggests common
variable immunodeficiency.
▸ Evaluation of IELs (with immunocytochemical staining for T
cells (CD3) in equivocal cases114) is vital. Counting IELs
should be time efficient—simply counting IELs/20 entero￾cytes at the tips of five villi,115 116 or IELs per 50 enterocytes
in two villi and summing these111 are both reliable and sensi￾tive methods using H&E staining methods. The normal
count has been variably cited; however, in evidence-based
practice111 and in recent classifications,109 112 <25IELs/100
enterocytes should be taken as the norm.
▸ Use of a simple classification system greatly enhances
intra-observer agreement.117
Other causes of lymphocytic duodenosis and villous atrophy
Lymphocytic duodenosis74 is a common condition (3.8% of a
population negative for coeliac serology111) seen in association
with infection (particularly Helicobacter pylori), altered
immune states, for example, common variable immunodefi￾ciency, autoimmune and chronic inflammatory disorders, drugs
and neoplasia.16 118–120 The villous architecture is normal, typ￾ically there is no crypt hyperplasia and IELs are ≥25/100
enterocytes. Of note, in a single study 16% of cases of lympho￾cytic duodenosis were found to have CD, and in 66% a known
association was found by further investigation.121 Similarly
there are other causes of villous atrophy in duodenal biopsies,
including immune disorders and deficiency, food hypersensitiv￾ity, infection, drugs, neoplasia and miscellaneous disor￾ders120 122 (table 2). In a study of non-coeliac enteropathy,
70% of patients with this condition were initially diagnosed as
having CD.123
NOVEL DIAGNOSTIC METHODS
While the current standard tests of serology and conventional
histology are usually adequate to reach a diagnosis of CD, there
are patients whose tests are equivocal and diagnostic uncertainty
remains. Several novel diagnostic approaches have been under￾taken. The deposition of IgA antibodies in close proximity to
TG2 in the small intestine has shown promise as a way of defin￾ing early or potential CD in patients who are seropositive but
lack any of the usual histological markers for CD. Recent work
from Finland on IgA-TG2 autoantibody deposition in the small
intestine in such patients shows promise in delivery of an early

prediction of development of CD. However, this is currently
experimental and the methodology requires tissue sections
frozen in liquid nitrogen.124 Another diagnostic method merit￾ing further evaluation is EmA assay in the culture medium of
small intestinal biopsies.125 126 Other investigators have
reported their findings using new techniques associated with
endoscopy to enhance the diagnosis of CD. These include con￾focal microscopy, high-resolution magnification endoscopy,
optical band imaging127 and optimal coherence tomography.
These novel techniques are still limited by availability, tolerabil￾ity and cost.98 However, the immersion technique and dye
enhancement in which the endoscopist instills water or a con￾trast dye (for example, indigo carmine or methylene blue) into
the bowel lumen, with or without the assistance of magnifica￾tion endoscopy, enhancing the visualisation of the villus128 can
be readily used and improves visualisation of villi, thus increas￾ing the sensitivity for detection of villous atrophy.98
Dermatitis herpetiformis
Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is the cutaneous manifestation of
gluten-sensitive enteropathy precipitated by exposure to dietary
gluten.129 It is characterised clinically by herpetiform clusters of
intensely itchy urticated papules and small blisters distributed
on the extensor aspects of the elbows and knees and over the
buttocks and on the scalp. The commonest age of onset is
between the third and fourth decade, though the condition may
occur at any age after weaning. Male patients are affected twice
as often as female patients. For the majority of patients the
disease is lifelong with varying periods of activity, potentially
due to varying degrees of dietary adherence.
The major diagnostic criterion for diagnosis is the presence of
granular IgA deposits in the dermal papillae of uninvolved peri￾lesional skin as shown by direct immunofluorescence, and the
diagnosis should not be made unless this has been confirmed.130
Less than 10% of patients with DH have symptoms or signs
of malabsorption but most have evidence of CD that responds
to a GFD and relapses on gluten challenge. Patients with DH
present with their skin manifestations and are not usually
troubled by the underlying small bowel problem at the time of
presentation.129 131 Abnormality of the small intestinal mucosa
with either total or subtotal villous atrophy is found in approxi￾mately 70% of patients with DH.132 A further 25% have
normal villous architecture with increased IELs.
DH shares with CD an increased risk of developing lymphomas
but this seems to be confined to those with severe gut involve￾ment. The risk similarly declines with time on a strict GFD.133
Due to rash and itch, dapsone is often initiated. More than
70% of patients on a strict GFD are however able to slowly
wean off dapsone over a period of 24 months.131
FOLLOW-UP
There is a paucity of data pertaining to adherence to a GFD
being improved by follow-up in patients with CD.17 134–138
Only one previous historical study has assessed the impact of
regular follow-up (annual review) at a dedicated doctor-led
coeliac clinic.136 The investigators suggested that adherence was
improved by having access and regular follow-up within the
setting of a specialist coeliac clinic (improvement in adherence
was 97.5% for those under clinic follow-up vs 40.4% for those
no longer under follow-up); however as this was an observa￾tional study and there were likely to be marked biases in referral
of cases, it is not possible to be confident that the associations
seen were causal. There are no published data assessing the
value of this approach or whether adherence to a GFD, QoL,
avoidance of complications, or satisfaction with the service is
improved by offering a dietitian-led coeliac clinic. One of the
key factors relating to adherence is dietetic input and regular
follow-up.17 134 Optimally, the clinic should have gastrointes￾tinal and dietetic expertise.139 Patients should be encouraged to
join disease-specific patient support groups if applicable.140
Once the disease is stable and the patients manage their diet
without any problems, annual follow-ups should be initiated. The
physician should check on intact small intestinal absorption (full
blood count, ferritin,32 serum folate,141 vitamin B12,142
calcium,143 alkaline phosphatase144), associated autoimmune con￾ditions (thyroid-stimulating hormone and thyroid hormone(s),145
and serum glucose),146 147 liver disease (aspartate aminotransfer￾ase/alanine aminotransferase)40 and dietary adherence (anti-TG2
or EMA/DGP), although the sensitivity and specificity of the
latter148 149 cannot substitute for structured dietary interview.
In follow-up of CD, the key endpoints are normalisation of
the health of patients judged by an absence of symptoms, and
mucosal healing.17 A lack of symptoms72 150 151 or negative
serological markers are not reliable or responsive surrogates of
mucosal response to diet. Dickey et al reported that among 32
patients with CD and persistent villous atrophy, EMA had nor￾malised in 27 (84%); while another British study found that
7/16 (44%) individuals with persistent villous atrophy at
follow-up biopsy had a normalised TTG.149 152–154
The proportion of patients who do not achieve full histo￾logical recovery on diet varies, with most reports suggesting
mucosal healing in 57–76%.150 155–159
Some experts favour repeat intestinal biopsy after 1 year of
dietary therapy; others, however, do not believe a repeat biopsy
is essential for coeliac management in typical cases. It is univer￾sally acknowledged that there is little evidence to address
whether clinical outcomes are significantly altered as a result of
re-biopsy and that the cost–benefit analysis of such an approach
has yet to be fully established.
Recommendations
▸ Follow-up biopsies may be considered in patients with CD,
and are potentially helpful in identifying patients at
increased risk of lymphoma. (Grade B)
▸ Follow-up biopsies are not mandatory if the patient with CD
is asymptomatic on a GFD, and has no other features that
suggest an increased risk of complications. (Grade C)
▸ Follow-up biopsies should be undertaken in patients with CD
whose condition does not respond to a GFD. (Grade C)
Assessing adherence to the GFD
Whilst the panel of experts agree adherence to the GFD is most
important for the health of a patient with CD, there are no
evidence-based grade A recommendations regarding the most
useful way to assess this. Dietary adherence should guarantee
mucosal healing and at least remission of most gastrointestinal
symptoms. At present there are no non-invasive biomarkers that
indicate complete mucosal recovery and a number of studies
indicate a high prevalence of villous atrophy in adult patients
with CD who appear to be adherent (see table 3). When specif￾ically questioned, the experts agreed there is a difference
between the first-year follow-up of a newly diagnosed patient
and long-term follow-up of an adherent patient with stable
disease. An adherent patient with stable disease needs less
follow-up and testing than a patient with newly diagnosed CD

in whom the GFD has just commenced, and neither the mucosa
nor biochemical aberrations have yet normalised.
There are four steps to assess dietary adherence: clinical
assessment of symptoms, dietetic review, serum antibodies and
follow-up biopsy.
Symptoms
A meta-analysis of seven studies including more than 3000 sub￾jects showed that the presence of gastrointestinal IBS-like symp￾toms is common in CD. IBS-type symptoms are more common
in patients with CD who are not adherent to a GFD (OR 2.69;
95% CI 0.75 to 9.56).161 However, patients with CD who are
also adherent to a GFD are more likely to experience (persist￾ent) symptoms than controls.161
Dietetic review
The second step is a careful dietetic review conducted by a diet￾itian or dedicated physician. Apart from a visual analogue score
scale which consists of an unmarked line with the anchor sentences
‘I never adhere to my diet’ and ‘I always adhere to my diet’ at each
end,162 there are a number of questionnaires evaluating self￾reported GFD adherence and food frequency in the English lan￾guage163–166 that are also available in other languages.167–171
These questionnaires should be augmented by a dietetic review,
which is a useful tool to tease out inadvertent gluten intake and to
provide education for a balanced and adequate nutrient intake.
There is no standard or quality control for dietetic review because
local diets and habits require a specific structured interview, which
is related to the quality of the diet. Currently, no data are available
on GFD review outcomes in different countries, and there is no
evidence that a careful review can substitute for other tools (eg,
biopsy) to predict mucosal damage.
Studies report that poor dietary adherence due to occasional
lapses is frequent and it is influenced by a number of factors,
such as age at diagnosis, knowledge of disease and psychological
factors.172 173
Serology
The third step in the first year is to check the IgA-TG2 or appro￾priate serology. Despite contradictory results,148 149 it is reason￾able to assume that positive antibody titres correspond to some
gluten intake and there is also some evidence that low TTG
titres do not accurately predict mucosal recovery.148 149 Tursi
et al148 reported that out of 17 patients with persistent villous
atrophy 1 year after diagnosis, only 1 (6%) was anti-TG2-
positive and 3 (18%) EMA-positive. Vahedi et al149 reported a

This table is restricted to studies involving at least 100 patients and presents available data on histological recovery of the duodenal mucosa.
Comment on table: In adult studies with >100 patients, non-adherence to a gluten-free diet is a major reason for poor outcome. Symptoms are not a reliable predictor of mucosal
healing. Antibodies are not good enough to predict small intestinal damage,149 so a follow-up biopsy is important. Lymphocytic duodenosis is common, but not significant in
contribution to symptoms, although it correlates with transgression of adherence to diet.

substantially higher sensitivity for persistent total villous
atrophy (73% and 91% for IgA-TG2 and EMA, respectively),
but reported no data for partial villous atrophy.
Follow-up biopsy
The last step is the follow-up biopsy. Some authors suggested
that it is important to perform a duodenal biopsy to assess the
recovery of intestinal mucosa and to exclude RCD and malig￾nancies. However, one recent study of 7648 individuals failed
to show that overall mortality was increased in patients with CD
with persistent villous atrophy at follow-up biopsy in patients
with a median follow-up of more than 11 years.174
In many cases 1 year is too brief a timespan to obtain com￾plete recovery of duodenal mucosa. Tuire et al72 found that
IELs were more frequent even 2–5 years after coeliac diagnosis
compared with thereafter. Some experts do not routinely
perform a follow-up biopsy in asymptomatic patients with nega￾tive serology and good adherence. Currently there are no
studies indicating an absolute necessity of follow-up biopsy for
all patients, but of eight major studies, five150 151 159 160 175
examined follow-up biopsies at roughly 2–5 years (table 3). This
may be related to costs (economic and psychological) of per￾forming a procedure that in theory should be repeated many
times over the years of follow-up as dietary adherence may vary
over time.
The authors of this review underline the necessity of distin￾guishing asymptomatic patients in whom clinical improvement,
negative serology, and potentially a follow-up biopsy and good
adherence assessed by dietetic review are considered sufficient
from symptomatic patients in whom repeated biopsies are
needed to rule out RCD or malignancies. Studies report that
poor dietary adherence due to occasional lapses is frequent and
it is influenced by a number of factors, such as age at diagnosis,
knowledge of disease and psychological factors.172 173
Histological recovery of duodenal mucosa in adult patients
with CD
In adults, neither symptoms72 150 151 156 158–160 nor serology149
is reliable to predict small intestinal damage;149 assessing
mucosal healing by biopsy is the key. Serum antibodies have
poor sensitivity for persistent villous atrophy, especially 1 year
or more after diagnosis and institution of a GFD.
Lymphocytic duodenosis is commonly seen on biopsy of
follow-up patients. It is rarely symptomatic, although it may also
correlate with transgression of adherence from the GFD.72
Early biopsy (at 6 months) is not considered to be optimal.156
Recommendations
▸ When adherence is questioned, it should be reviewed by a
dietitian. (Grade C)
▸ Symptomatic patients should be evaluated more thoroughly
than asymptomatic patients. (Grade C)
Gluten challenge
To perform a gluten challenge, a recent study recommends a
14-day gluten intake at ≥3 g of gluten/day (two slices of wheat
bread per day) to induce histological and serological changes in
the majority of adults with CD.176 The challenge can be pro￾longed to 8 weeks if serology remains negative at 2 weeks (in
the Leffler et al176 study, serology was negative after 2 weeks in
all cases, but positive after another 2 weeks).
Medical management during follow-up
Long-term follow-up can be in secondary care clinics or in
primary care as long as the expertise is available.177 However,
prompt access to specialist centres or secondary care is recom￾mended if any problems arise, and it should be noted that the
need for long-term follow-up is controversial.17 178
The risk of osteoporosis144 179–183 and bone fracture184–190 is
increased with CD,2 with one Swedish study showing an excess
risk of any fracture of 481/100 000 person-years in adults with
CD189 and a British study (13% of individuals were children)
320/100 000 person-years.184 The excess risk is reduced with
good dietary adherence and reduction in intestinal villous
atrophy, and bone density increases during the first year of GFD
adherence.191–195 However, one population-based study found a
similar excess risk for fractures before and after coeliac diagnosis
(eg, the incidence ratio 5–10 years before CD diagnosis was 1.8
compared with 2.2 some 5–10 years after diagnosis).189
On the basis of current evidence, the suggestion should there￾fore be to measure calcium, alkaline phosphatase and vitamin D
levels (and parathyroid hormone for compensatory increase) at
diagnosis and replace as necessary. Calcium intake should be
maintained at or above 1000 mg per day.196 Bone density
should be measured in those at high risk of osteoporosis; appro￾priate criteria for judging this are given by the BSG (http://www.
bsg.org.uk/images/stories/clinical/ost_coe_ibd.pdf ). Repeat bone
density investigations (generally after an interval of ≥2 years)
should otherwise be considered in patients who have low bone
density on index measurement following initiation of appropri￾ate treatment, or who have evidence of ongoing villous atrophy
or poor dietary adherence. Postmenopausal women with CD
may require supplementation in addition to the GFD.197 Loss of
bone density at a greater than expected rate should prompt
measurement of vitamin D levels, dietary review of adherence,
consideration of repeat intestinal mucosal biopsy and review of
additional risk factors such as hypogonadism.
Hyposplenism198 associated with CD may result in impaired
immunity to encapsulated bacteria, and an increase in such
infections has been demonstrated in CD.199–201 Hyposplenism
does not seem to correlate with duration of GFD.198
Vaccination against Pneumococcus is therefore recommended.202
However, it is unclear whether vaccination with the conjugated
vaccine is preferable in this setting and whether additional vac￾cination against Haemophilus, Meningococcus and Influenza203
should be considered if not previously given.204 It should also
be noted that patients with CD may have a weaker response to
hepatitis B vaccination than normal.205 206
Recommendations
▸ Newly diagnosed patients should have vaccination for
Pneumococcus. (Grade C)
▸ Bone density should be measured after 1 year of diet in
patients who have additional risk factors for osteoporosis or
if over the age of 55 years. (Grade D)
▸ Adult patients with CD should have a calcium intake of at
least 1000 mg per day. (Grade D)
▸ Patients with CD require follow-up by a dietitian and/or
clinician with an interest or expertise in this field. (Grade D)
▸ Patients should have annual haematological and biochemical
profiles. (Grade D)
▸ A GFD is the core management strategy for prevention of
osteoporosis. (Grade D)

SCREENING FOR CD
Table 4 lists the WHO criteria for general population screening.
CD fulfils many of these criteria but not all of them as yet. Our
recommendation is active case finding but not mass screening.
Given that CD is a common disease (about 1% of the western
population22 24) and that there is a therapy (GFD) that most
often relieves symptoms, and may even have an effect on the
risk of future complications, any patient with signs or symptoms
of CD should undergo testing.
In addition, testing should be carried out in high-risk groups
such as those with iron deficiency anaemia,224 Down’s syn￾drome,225 type 1 diabetes mellitus,147 osteoporosis184 189 226
and IBS when CD is suspected. The coeliac prevalence in these
groups typically varies between 2% and 5%.144 227 228
Recommendations
▸ There is insufficient evidence to recommend population
screening for CD, however there should be a low threshold
for case finding in clinical practice as per National Institute
for Health and Care Excellence guidelines.3 (Grade B)
▸ Symptomatic first-degree relatives of patients with CD
should undergo CD testing. (Grade C)
QUALITY OF LIFE
There has been a growing interest in how patients with CD per￾ceive the impact of their diagnosis, how their psychological state
is influenced by the disease and the effect of GFD. Several
studies report that patients with CD have lower QoL scores
than the general population.229–232
Though some studies have found improved QoL with GFD
treatment in symptomatic and screening-detected patients,222 233
others suggest that any benefit of diet is restricted to those pre￾senting with symptomatic disease.214 220 221 Since mood disor￾ders such as anxiety, depression and fatigue are often linked
with CD, before and after diagnosis, it is likely that they may
contribute to the effect upon QoL. A recent meta-analysis234
suggested that depression, but not anxiety, is more common in
adults with CD. Also fatigue has been linked to undetected
CD.235
GLUTEN-FREE DIET
The mainstay of treatment of CD and DH is a GFD. The term
gluten should be used to indicate not only wheat-based proteins
(gliadins), but it also includes those from barley (hordeins) and
rye (secalins), and cereal hybrids such as triticale.236 Originally
oats were also avoided in the GFD. Earlier research indicates
that oats uncontaminated by gluten are probably safe for
patients with CD.237 238 This is important because oats contain
soluble fibre, are able to lower blood glucose and attenuate
insulin response.239 The appearance of symptoms related to
introducing oats might be due to cross contamination. Also a
small percentage of patients with CD may be sensitive to oats240
and develop symptoms or even mucosal damage.241 242 Patients
with CD should be educated to avoid cereals and food contain￾ing gluten (breakfast cereals, flours, pasta, cakes, biscuits, sauces
etc) derived from wheat, barley or rye and food made from
gluten-contaminated oats, and encouraged to eat naturally
occurring gluten-free foods and alternative sources of starch
(corn, rice, potatoes etc). Levels of susceptibility to gluten con￾tamination of food vary among patients with CD. Although it
has also been suggested that the acceptable threshold for gluten
content in gluten-free products can from the clinical point of
view be set at 100 ppm (¼ mg/kg),243 the Codex Alimentarius
Commission of the WHO issued new guidelines for gluten
content of processed food in 2008 and a law from the
European Commission (EC41/2009), effective since January
2012, stipulated that foods labelled as ‘gluten free’ should
contain ≤20 parts per million of gluten, and that this gluten
content is safe for the coeliac population. The 20 ppm threshold
for gluten-free food is also accepted by the US Food and Drug
Administration, effective since August 2013. Newly diagnosed
patients should be referred to a dietitian to discuss dietary man￾agement.243 It is important that they are educated not only to
avoid gluten but also to have a sufficient intake of nutrients,
vitamins, fibre and calcium present in their GFD.244 Recent data
also indicate that a strict GFD might be of help in reaching ideal
body weight, whether an individual is underweight or obese at
diagnosis.245 Data suggest that adherence to the GFD is better
achieved when the patient is well educated and supported by
carers and families. However, there is a wide variation in provi￾sion of dietary consultation services for patients diagnosed with
CD in the world. A survey indicates that dietetic support may
be underprovided in the UK.246
Table 4 CD as a candidate for general population screening
WHO criteria Comment
That the disease is common and well defined CD occurs in approximately 1% of the western population,24 111 and is even more frequent in selected
populations.207 208
Screening tests are simple, safe and accurate IgA-TG2 screening offers high sensitivity and specificity but the positive predictive value does not attain 100%,83
with a consequent risk of false-positive cases.92 209
The screening test should be culturally acceptable Screening seems to be culturally accepted in most parts of the world
Treatment is available GFD offers symptomatic relief and will often lead to mucosal healing.
Clinical detection is difficult The clinical picture of CD varies, and many patients only have minor symptoms,31 208 210 making it difficult to
diagnose CD.
If undiagnosed and untreated the disease will lead
to severe complications
The only available treatment is a GFD. The GFD seems to reduce symptoms and the risk of complications in
symptomatic patients,211–213 but it is doubtful whether the GFD leads to health gains in asymptomatic
patients,81 214–218 219 although it should be noted that a proportion of patients who first claim to be asymptomatic in
fact have symptoms.216 It is also unclear if QoL in patients with screen-detected asymptomatic CD is
different81 214 217 220–223 from that of the control populations. Without a decrease in pre-diagnostic QoL, institution of
a GFD is unlikely to result in improved QoL after diagnosis.
Testing and treatment is cost effective Cost effectiveness depends on the duration of symptoms and the risk of complications in untreated versus treated CD.
It is still not clear if the risk of complications is substantially lower in diagnosed CD than in undiagnosed CD.

Safe gluten intake?
As shown previously, diagnosis and advice on a gluten-free diet
often lead to mucosal recovery, while poor adherence to diet
slows or hinders complete recovery.
Whilst contamination of the diet by gluten may be unavoid￾able and increased IEL counts are associated with less severe
nutritional and metabolic consequences than classic CD with
villous atrophy, patients may have significant signs and symp￾toms related to this disorder. A clinical response and mucosal
recovery can be achieved by strict adherence to a gluten-free
diet. On balance, data support treatment of patients with CD
regardless of the degree of mucosal damage.247
A recent review on ‘safe’ gluten levels argues that daily
intakes of <10 mg have no effect on mucosal histology,248
whereas definite alterations are caused by a daily intake of
500 mg and observable alterations by 100 mg. A calculated daily
intake of 30 mg seems not to harm the mucosa. Therefore, at
present, a safe limit could be set between 10 and 100 mg.249
The most comprehensive systematic review (35 studies) suggests
that while the amount of tolerable gluten varies among people
with CD, a daily gluten intake of <10 mg is unlikely to cause
significant histological abnormalities.248
There is extensive research on GFD and how this may influence
the clinical course. While a recent study of more than 7000 indivi￾duals undergoing follow-up biopsy found no association between
persistent villous atrophy (likely to signal poorer dietary adherence)
and overall mortality,174 this does not rule out that poor dietary
adherence is negative for specific health outcome, such as auto￾immune disease,250 251 pregnancy outcome (two studies have found
poor foetal outcome in pregnant women with undiagnosed CD but
not in diagnosed CD41 252), and especially the risk of lymphoma.
Most studies on lymphoma risk according to dietary adherence
point towards a protective effect from GFD but the studies have so
far been small in size,212 253–255 preventing firm conclusions.
However, recently Lebwohl et al175 found a statistically significantly
increased risk of lymphoma in patients with CD with persistent
villous atrophy compared with those with mucosal healing.
A frequent complaint of patients with CD is that they experience
limitations in their social life because of difficulty accessing gluten￾free meals or concern about the safety of food when eating out. The
patients’ worries are justified as a survey shows that chefs’ knowl￾edge about CD is lower than that of the general public.256
Therefore, education about a GFD needs to be directed to catering
personnel. Another criticism is that the availability of gluten-free
food is clearly limited in more rural areas and shopping for gluten￾free food is time consuming. In most countries, high-quality gluten￾free products are available in supermarkets or in special health food
stores and on the internet, but the cost of gluten-free food is much
greater than the equivalent wheat-based foods.257 258
Recommendations
▸ Patients should adhere to a GFD and have an intake of less
than 10 mg gluten per day. (Grade B)
▸ Gluten challenge is not recommended in the ordinary
patient with CD, but in patients in whom the diagnosis
remains unclear despite a follow-up biopsy, gluten challenge
should be performed. (Grade C)
▸ Patients may commence gluten-free oats at diagnosis. (Grade D)
▸ A GFD is recommended to decrease the excess risk of
adverse foetal outcome and of lymphoma among patients
with CD. (Grade C)
Patient information and support
Patient support should not be a monologue by a physician, but
instead a two-way communication involving the patient, and his/
her family. Ideally, collaboration between the patient, the patient’s
family, an expert dietitian and interested physician should be the
setting in which the GFD should be initiated. Family involvement
is very important as the disease (including GFD) will inevitably
affect family members, but also joining a national coeliac support
group can help patients cope with their disease.
Patients need information, reassurance and the opportunity to
learn at their pace about the rather challenging demands of a
GFD. They particularly need to be encouraged and motivated
to adapt to and maintain a GFD. Continued professional
engagement in their follow-up care is likely to help sustain that
motivation. Unfortunately, many patients report that they are
not satisfied with the amount and quality of the information
offered by their physician.216 Physicians should inform patients
even before the CD diagnosis, offering information about sero￾logical testing, and what it means to undergo a small intestinal
biopsy. Worries are common in patients awaiting a biopsy259
and the physician should address this anxiety.
Patients may want information about when and where CD
occurs, its aetiology and whether it is a common disease or not.
Understanding the vital role of GFD in the management of CD
is important for dietary adherence.140 Attaining dietary adher￾ence may be particularly difficult in patients identified through
screening. Patients with CD often report reduced QoL because
of dietetic restrictions and this must be taken into
account.260–263 Part of the reduced QoL may be due to social
restrictions, such as not being able to eat out with friends, and
the economic burden from the more expensive GFD.258 264
Patients should also be informed that while most symptoms are
likely to go away on a GFD, some symptoms may persist (see
section on ‘Non-responsive CD’).
Recommendation
▸ At diagnosis, patients should be encouraged to join their
national coeliac support group. In the UK, patients should be
advised about gluten-free items on prescription (FP10),
details of which are available from http://www.coeliac.org.uk.
Non-responsive CD
After adoption of the GFD, 4–30% of patients with CD report
persisting symptoms and are considered to be affected by non￾responsive CD (NRCD).265 Once the initial diagnosis of CD has
been confirmed, adherence to the GFD should be assessed by an
expert dietitian as inadvertent or deliberate gluten exposure is
the most frequent cause of NRCD.265 266
After these initial steps, evaluation should be individualised;
however assessment for ongoing enteropathy plays a central
role, therefore a follow-up biopsy is needed. Small bowel
imaging should be performed in any patient with abdominal
pain, persisting fever, obstruction, anaemia, gastrointestinal
bleeding or unexplained weight loss.267 If duodenal biopsy does
not reveal a persistent enteropathy, symptoms are likely to be
due to a second condition.265 268
While the GFD is efficacious at controlling the signs and
symptoms of CD and improving intestinal histology in most
patients, treatment of CD is currently imperfect. Over time, vir￾tually all individuals with CD will have symptomatic exacerba￾tions due to gluten exposure and up to 30% of patients will

have symptoms severe or chronic enough to visit their treating
physician265 266
Comprehensive monitoring of patients with CD requires
assessment for NRCD and efficient evaluation for potential aeti￾ologies. NRCD may be considered in three categories.265 266 269
First and most commonly, NRCD is due to continued dietary
exposure to gluten.265 266 269 Second, it may be due to a pre￾existing or coincidental condition causing symptoms that resem￾ble CD which may have led to the detection of otherwise
asymptomatic CD—this includes IBS33 or colonic malignancy
causing anaemia.270 Finally, it may be due to conditions asso￾ciated with CD,268 such as secondary lactose intolerance,265
pancreatic exocrine insufficiency,271 small bowel bacterial over￾growth, microscopic colitis272 and cow’s milk protein sensitivity.
Very occasionally a state refractory to gluten withdrawal
occurs, referred to as RCD. Figure 2 suggests an outline for
investigating patients with NRCD.
In symptomatic patients with ongoing enteropathy and RCD,
coeliac-related malignancies and disorders that mimic CD (table
2) must be excluded. RCD is defined as persistent or recurrent
malabsorptive symptoms and/or signs with villous atrophy
despite a strict GFD for more than 12 months in the absence of
other causes of villous atrophy or malignant complications and
after confirmation of CD.7 RCD is subdivided into type I
(RCDI) and type II (RCDII). The most important aspect of dif￾ferentiating RCDI and RCDII is demonstration of a monoclonal
population of T cells or aberrant T cells in the latter. There are
different methods available for this, including genetic analysis of
T-cell receptor clonality, immunohistochemistry and flow cyto￾metry. Most laboratories will employ at least two methods but
their relative contributions remain uncertain. Currently there is
variation in the criteria used to diagnose RCDII. The two
factors that support the diagnosis of RCDII include loss of
normal surface markers CD3 and CD8 with preserved expres￾sion of intracytoplasmic CD3 and detection of monoclonal
rearrangement of T-cell receptor chain.120 Areas of uncertainty
include the use of immunohistochemistry versus flow cytometry
for IEL classification and the relative prognosis of patients with
discordant IEL and T-cell studies.
Patients with normal CD3 and CD8 expression and no evi￾dence of T-cell monoclonality have RCDI with a good progno￾sis. Patients with RCDII have a poorer prognosis, due
predominantly to nutritional complications and transformation
into enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma (EATL).273 274
Ulcerative jejunoileitis (UJI) is a rare condition characterised by
inflammatory ulceration of the small bowel that arises in
RCD.274–276 The finding of UJI should raise suspicion for
lymphoma.

There is no standard treatment for RCD. Elemental diets, sys￾temic steroids, oral budesonide, oral thioguanines including
azathioprine are used in RCDI (and sometimes are beneficial),
but have limited benefit in RCDII.277 278 In RCDII, cyclospor￾ine, cladribine and high-dose chemotherapy with autologous
stem cell support have been reported; however, therapy must be
individualised and include surveillance for EATL.120
EATL is a rare lymphoma strongly associated with RCDII,273
which carries a poor prognosis with a cumulative 5-year survival
of less than 20%.279 280 Currently, two groups of EATL are
recognised281: EATL type I accounts for 80–90% of all cases and
is a large cell lymphoma exclusively associated with CD.282 In
contrast, EATL type II has not been associated with CD.281 283
The poor prognosis of EATL is determined by extent of
disease at diagnosis, multifocal small bowel involvement, poor
general health and presence of complications including perfor￾ation that preclude chemotherapy.120 Presence of RCDII is asso￾ciated with a poor prognosis compared with isolated EATL in
CD without RCDII. There is no proven effective treatment in
RCDII, though a number of strategies have been proposed, and
patients should be referred to a tertiary centre to optimise their
management.
Finally, numerous studies have confirmed the association
between CD and B-cell lymphoma284–286 and CD and small
intestinal adenocarcinoma.42 254 287–289
Recommendations
▸ Patients with persistent symptoms despite a GFD should
have a follow-up biopsy. (Grade B)
▸ In symptomatic patients with ongoing enteropathy and RCD,
coeliac-related malignancies and disorders that mimic CD
must be excluded. (Grade C)
▸ Small bowel imaging should be performed in any patient with
abdominal pain, fever, obstruction, anaemia, gastrointestinal
bleeding or unexplained weight loss. (Grade D)
▸ Patients with RCD should be referred to a tertiary centre to
optimise their management. (Grade D)
NOVEL TREATMENT
The role of non-dietary therapies—as an adjunct or as an alter￾native to the GFD—has yet to be ascertained. Of the candidate
approaches, immunotherapy (including hookworm expos￾ure)290 291 is currently explored as an alternative to GFD but,
even if successful, is unlikely to benefit all patients. The role of
glutenases (propyl endopeptidases) and tight junction regulators
(table 5) are likely to be in reducing the threshold response and
optimising the benefits of gluten restriction rather than allowing
a normal gluten-containing diet.
Table 5 contains a list of potential novel treatments. None of
the available novel treatments can as yet ( January 2014) be
recommended for use outside clinical trials.
Recommendation
▸ None of the available novel treatments can as yet be

DISCUSSION
We recommend testing for CD in those with suggested symp￾toms or syndromes, especially if they have a first-degree relative
with CD.53 There is not yet sufficient evidence to support indis￾criminate general population screening. Specific serology such as
IgA-TG2 and IgG-DGP with or without a strategy for determin￾ation of total IgA level should be the preferred serologic strategy
for detection of CD. Ideally a combination of serology and
biopsies done on a gluten-containing diet will then provide the
most robust diagnosis of CD. Additional testing may be neces￾sary for those with less than clear-cut results.
We recommend a duodenal biopsy before the diagnosis of CD.
This contrasts with the recent ESPGHAN recommendations
where a duodenal biopsy is optional in symptomatic paediatric
patients in whom the IgA-TG2 level exceeds 10 times the upper
limit of normal, EMA antibodies are positive on a separately
taken blood sample and HLA typing is positive for DQ2 or
DQ8.1 CD has been linked to a large number of symptoms
(table 1 in the ESPGHAN review on paediatric CD lists 16 such

Cereal genomics The high copy numbers in gliadin genes have so far limited attempts to genetically modify cultivars incapable of
expressing immunotoxic peptides292
RNA interference of protein translation may reduce gliadin expression, with evidence of reduced proliferation of
lymphocytes challenged in vitro293
Prolyl endopeptidases (PEPs) These endopeptidases have been isolated from microbial sources and may be capable of enzymatic cleavage of the
immunotoxic gluten peptides ex vivo.294 295 296 A combination of a glutamine-specific endoprotease (EP-B2 from barley)
and a prolyl endopeptidase (subcutaneous PEP from Sphingomonas capsulata)

on symptoms and signs.301
TG2 inhibitors Candidate peptidomimetic blockers are currently entering clinical trials but no data are available yet.302 A potential
limitation of this drug candidate is that TG2 activity occurs in a number of diseases and a TG2 inhibitor may therefore
have unwanted side effects

symptoms and signs with additional symptoms in the text).1
There is a risk that all symptoms, independent of their origin,
may be taken as a sign of CD when the sensitivity and specificity
of even gastrointestinal symptoms are moderate in CD.304
Other reasons to require a small intestinal biopsy prior to diag￾nosis is that not all commercial IgA-TG2 kits are of high
quality,78 and that alternative diagnoses may be more common,
and sometimes serious, in adults with suspected CD. Finally, an
initial biopsy is important for the follow-up of patients, espe￾cially those whose condition is non-responsive to a GFD.
Adequate (more than four) biopsies should be taken, from the
distal duodenum and the duodenal bulb to maximise diagnosis.
The threshold for abnormal IELs is ≥25/100 enterocytes, but
for a definite diagnosis villous atrophy is required. However,
lesser degrees of damage (≥25 IELs but no villous atrophy) com￾bined with positive serology (IgA-EMA, TTG or IgG–DGP) may
also represent CD (‘probable CD’),
The treatment of CD is a lifelong and strict GFD. The goal of
treatment is to relieve symptoms, achieve mucosal healing, avoid
complications of CD, and have a good QoL with a nutritionally
complete GFD. This is best achieved when patients are moti￾vated and receive expert information in a collaborative way,
with resources including expert dietitians and interested medical
care. Follow-up of CD is needed to ensure response to symp￾toms, prevention of consequences, and continued maintenance
of motivation to remain gluten free.
Discussions upon the issue of repeating duodenal biopsies
were intense in our group. There is no conclusive evidence of
the benefit of universal follow-up biopsy, and we were unable to
reach a consensus. Some would undertake follow-up biopsies in
all patients with CD after 2–5 years on a GFD (table 3). There
are others who reserve follow-up biopsies for those in whom
there are persistent and recurrent symptoms or those for whom
the follow-up biopsies are necessary to help confirm the diagno￾sis in the setting of continued diagnostic uncertainty.
There are novel techniques that may enhance the sensitivity
of endoscopic examination, of which the immersion technique
is probably the most feasible currently. An understanding of the
precise value of various serologic strategies in the detection of
CD is continuing to evolve, as are advances in therapies that
may ultimately provide some mitigation of the impairment of
the QoL that is inherent in a strict GFD.
Ultimately, this review should not be regarded as fixed. Instead it
represents our understanding of what is best in adult CD manage￾ment according to current knowledge. It is likely, and indeed we
hope, that there will be substantial progress in diagnosis, evaluation
and management of CD to reduce the burden on the patient and
society. We anticipate that future updated versions of these guide￾lines will be based on evolving published literature that may have an
audit or research base relevant to adult CD. Data in this review were
mostly retrieved through searches of PubMed. We acknowledge that
there are other medical databases and we cannot rule out that had
we searched more than one database we may have identified add￾itional relevant studies that have now been left out of this review.
Areas for future research
The panel of experts recognise that the main challenge in the
future is to allocate available resources effectively to reduce the
burden of disease from CD.
Future research should focus on the following areas:
▸ how to induce long-term remission without a GFD, that is,
novel therapies and vaccine;
▸ better understanding of the disease processes, including gen￾etics and antigen presentation;
▸ prevent and cure extra-intestinal manifestation and complica￾tions, including infections;
▸ be able to assess tolerable amount of gluten for individual
patients;
▸ define the role of duodenal biopsy, serology and point of
care testing at diagnosis and follow-up;
▸ find a robust and valid blood marker for diagnosis and moni￾toring of the disease;
▸ understand the pathogenesis of RCDI and II.
