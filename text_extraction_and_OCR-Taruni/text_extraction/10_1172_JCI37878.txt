Phase II clinical trials revealed thatthe lymphocyte-depleting humanized monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab
(Campath-1H)is highly effective in the treatment of early relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. However, 30%
of patients develop autoimmunity months to years after pulsed exposure to alemtuzumab, usually targeting
the thyroid gland and, more rarely, blood components. In this study, we show that autoimmunity arose in
those patients with greater T cell apoptosis and cell cycling in response to alemtuzumab-induced lymphocyte
depletion, a phenomenon that is driven by higher levels of IL-21. Before treatment, patients who went on to
develop secondary autoimmunity had more than 2-fold greater levels of serum IL-21 than the nonautoimmune
group. We suggest that serum IL-21 may, therefore, serve as a biomarker for the risk of developing autoimmu￾nity months to years after alemtuzumab treatment. This has implications for counseling those patients with
multiple sclerosis who are considering lymphocyte-depleting therapy with alemtuzumab. Finally, we dem￾onstrate through genotyping that IL-21 expression is genetically predetermined. We propose that, by driving
cycles of T cell expansion and apoptosis to excess, IL-21 increases the stochastic opportunities for T cells to
encounter self antigen and, hence, for autoimmunity.
Introduction
Autoimmunity arising in the context of lymphopenia is well recog￾nized experimentally but rarely encountered and, hence, difficult 
to study in humans. We have identified an example of predictable 
autoimmunity in humans, arising after treatment of multiple scle￾rosis with the lymphocyte-depleting monoclonal antibody alem￾tuzumab. This human “model” provides a unique opportunity to 
explore the immunological mechanisms underlying the develop￾ment of lymphopenia-associated autoimmunity in humans.
Alemtuzumab, licensed for the treatment of B cell chronic lym￾phocytic leukemia, is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed 
against CD52, a protein widely distributed on the surface of lym￾phocytes and monocytes but with unknown function. A single 
pulse of treatment leads to a rapid, profound, and prolonged lym￾phopenia. Cell numbers recover but at varying rates; CD4+ T cells 
are particularly slow to recover, remaining depleted for at least 
5 years (1). A recently published phase II trial has shown that alem￾tuzumab reduces the risk of disease activity and accumulation of 
disability by over 70% compared with interferon beta in patients 
with early relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (2). The princi￾pal adverse effect is autoimmunity, arising in the setting of T cell 
lymphopenia months to years after alemtuzumab: 20%–30% of 
patients develop thyroid autoimmunity, mainly Graves disease 
(3), and 3% have idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) (2). 
We have also observed 2 cases of Goodpasture disease and 1 case 
each of autoimmune neutropenia (1) and autoimmune hemolytic 
anaemia (Alasdair J. Coles, personal communication). In addition, 
a further 5.5% of patients develop sustained nonthyroid autoan￾tibodies without clinical disease (1). The timing and spectrum of 
autoimmunity after alemtuzumab is similar to that seen in other 
examples of “reconstitution autoimmunity” in other clinical con￾texts; for example, autoimmune thyroid disease and autoimmune 
cytopenias also predominate months to years after hematopoietic 
stem cell transplantation or antiretroviral treatment of HIV (4–8).
While the association between lymphopenia and autoimmunity 
is well recognized, most lymphopenic subjects do not develop 
autoimmunity, leading Krupica et al. to postulate that additional 
factors are involved (9). Among the secondary insults suggested 
by this group are (a) the depletion of Tregs, as seen in the murine 
colitis and gastritis models (10–13), and (b) overproduction of 
IL-21, as occurs in the NOD mouse (14). We have previously dis￾proved the first possibility: in the context of multiple sclerosis 
treatment by alemtuzumab, CD4+CD25hi Tregs and lymphocyte 
FoxP3 expression are both increased for 6 months after treatment 
and thereafter return to normal levels (15). This observation has 
since been replicated (16) and is in keeping with other experi￾mental lymphopenic models (17, 18). So, we have turned to the 
second suggestion, which arose from the observation that auto￾immunity in the NOD mouse is associated with increased T cell 
cycling and reduced T cell survival, driven by overproduction of 
IL-21 (14). Here, we show that a similar process underlies human

reconstitution autoimmunity. Specifically, we show that second￾ary autoimmunity following alemtuzumab treatment of multiple 
sclerosis occurs in those patients with greater T cell apoptosis and 
cell cycling, driven by genetically determined higher levels of IL-21, 
detectable even before treatment.
Results
Alemtuzumab induces a T cell lymphopenia. A single dose of alemtu￾zumab resulted in the depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes 
to 5.6% and 6.8%, respectively, of baseline values at month 1 and 
30.3% and 40.8%, respectively, at month 12 (data not shown).
T cells from patients with untreated multiple sclerosis are resistant to 
cell death. For various assays performed, different cross-sectional 
and longitudinal samples were used according to availability, as 
illustrated in Figure 1. As a prelude to measuring lymphocyte cell 
cycling after alemtuzumab, we examined the proliferative response 
of T cells, unstimulated or in culture with myelin basic protein 
(MBP) or the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHr), 
between untreated patients with multiple sclerosis and normal 
controls (Figure 2, B and C). There was no difference in prolifera￾tion, but survival of T cells from untreated patients with multi￾ple sclerosis was more than 4-fold greater than that of controls 
(P < 0.005; Figure 2D), suggesting that reduced T cell death is a 
feature of untreated multiple sclerosis. We confirmed this by dem￾onstrating that T cells from untreated patients are resistant both 
to passive and Fas-mediated apoptosis compared with healthy 
controls (passive, 0.3% vs. 6.7%, P = 0.0016; Fas mediated, 2.9% vs. 
15.5%, P = 0.0018; Figure 2, F and G).
T cells that regenerate after alemtuzumab are highly proliferative, skewed 
toward self reactivity, and susceptible to apoptosis. Following alemtu￾zumab, the proportion of T cells responding to self antigens (pre￾cursor frequency) and the degree of proliferation (proliferative 
index) were markedly increased compared with untreated patients 
and healthy controls. For example at month 3, unstimulated 
T cell proliferation was increased by more than 6.5 fold compared 
with untreated patients, and proliferation in response to MBP 
and TSHr stimulation was increased by 900% and 700%, respec￾tively (all P < 0.01; Figure 2, B and C). T cell apoptosis was also 
markedly increased after alemtuzumab. In response to antigenic 
stimulation, the proportion of T cells undergoing apoptosis at 
6 months was 10-fold greater than that at baseline (Figure 2E; 
P < 0.001 for all antigens), resulting in fewer viable T cells at the 
end of culture (Figure 2D). Passive and Fas-mediated apoptosis 
were also increased after alemtuzumab, with rates at least double 
those observed in the healthy control group (passive, 24.5%, 22.2%, 
and 17.9% at 6, 9, and 12 months, respectively, compared with 6.7% 
in controls, all P < 0.001; Fas mediated, 37.8%, 35.8%, and 29.9% at 
6, 9, and 12 months, respectively, compared with 15.5% in controls,

Serum IL-21 levels were determined in frozen pretreatment samples from 94 patients. Of these, 59 patients met the criteria for autoimmu￾nity/no autoimmunity, of which, 30 patients had serial (3 monthly) samples available (15 with autoimmunity and 15 without autoimmunity). (C)

all P < 0.01; Figure 2, F and G). Increased lymphocyte apoptosis 
after alemtuzumab was seen in both the CD4+ and CD8+ subpopu￾lations (Figure 2, H and I) and persisted for at least 18 months 
after alemtuzumab treatment (data not shown).
T cells from untreated patients with multiple sclerosis underexpress cas￾pase-3. To substantiate these observations on apoptosis, we mea￾sured T cell mRNA expression of caspase-3 (CASP3), the effector 
caspase common to both apoptotic pathways. This was reduced 
in untreated multiple sclerosis patients compared with controls; 
this was significant for unstimulated and MBP-stimulated PBMCs 
(by 78% and 87%, respectively, both P < 0.05, after correction for 
multiple comparisons) but not for polyclonal-stimulated cultures 
(Figure 3A). A similar trend was seen in CD14+ cells (but not CD19+
cells), although this difference did not survive correction for mul￾tiple comparisons (Figure 3B). After alemtuzumab, caspase-3 
expression was significantly increased in T cells and monocytes, 
reaching levels seen in healthy controls (P < 0.05; Figure 3, A and 
B). Expression of all other genes tested (listed in Methods) was 
unchanged after alemtuzumab.
Secondary autoimmunity after alemtuzumab is associated with excessive 
T cell apoptosis. Having demonstrated increased lymphocyte prolifera￾tion and apoptosis as a generic response to treatment, we tested the 
relationship between T cell apoptosis and development of autoim￾munity after alemtuzumab, defined as development of a novel auto￾immune disease and/or persistent autoantibodies above the normal 
range, after alemtuzumab, sustained over at least 3 months.
Using this definition, T cells derived from patients with auto￾immunity (n = 10) showed significantly higher levels of apoptotic 
cell death in all culture conditions at 9 months after treatment, 
when compared with T cells from nonautoimmune patients 
(n = 10) studied at the same time point (unstimulated, 4.7% vs. 
14.4%; Fas mediated, 18.2% vs. 32.1%; MBP, 7.6% vs. 17.6%; TSHr, 
9.5% vs. 25.5%; P < 0.01 for all comparisons; Figure 4). If a stricter 
definition of autoimmunity is applied, that being development of

an autoimmune disease, excluding nonpathogenic antibody pro￾duction, the difference remains, despite reducing the number in the 
autoimmune group to 7 (unstimulated, 4.7% vs. 15.4%; Fas medi￾ated, 18.2% vs. 31.7%; MBP, 7.6% vs. 20.2%; TSHr, 9.5% vs. 13.4%; 
P < 0.02 for all comparisons).
Both groups are markedly T cell depleted, with no difference in 
the rate of T cell reconstitution (e.g., at 6 months, CD4 counts are 
0.15 × 109/l vs. 0.19 × 109/l and CD8 counts are 0.11 × 109/l vs. 
0.11 × 109/l in those with and without autoimmunity, respectively; 
data not shown). Therefore, the autoimmune group is character￾ized by higher rates of proliferation and apoptosis but no net dif￾ference in lymphocyte numbers; in other words, it is characterized 
by increased T cell cycling.
IL-21 induces T cell proliferation and apoptosis and is associated with 
the development of secondary autoimmunity after alemtuzumab. The 
NOD mice data would suggest that this increased cell cycling 
is driven by high levels of IL-21; therefore, we tested the effect 
of exogenous IL-21 on apoptosis and proliferation of human 
T cells in vitro. Spiking PBMCs from healthy controls with recom￾binant human IL-21 (rhIL-21) led to an increase in the apoptotic 
death of unstimulated and polyclonally stimulated CD4+ (Figure 
5A) and CD8+ (Figure 5B) T cells in a dose-dependent manner 
(P < 0.05 for all conditions). Spiking unstimulated cells with 
rhIL-21 led to a small but significant increase in the proliferation 
of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, with an increase both in prolif￾erative index (CD4+, 1.07 vs. 1.25, P = 0.017; CD8+, 1.09 vs. 1.32, 
P = 0.017; Figure 6B) and precursor frequency (CD4+, 0.007 vs. 
0.014, P = 0.016; CD8+, 0.007 vs. 0.015, P = 0.026; Figure 6D). IL-21 
did not affect the proportion of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells proliferating 
in response to polyclonal stimulation (Figure 6E), suggesting they 
were already maximally stimulated. However, IL-21 led to a signifi￾cant increase in the extent of CD8+ cell proliferation (proliferative 
index, 11.59 vs. 19.39, P = 0.012; Figure 6C).
Next, we determined serum IL-21 levels in all patients with 
stored serial samples (n = 30; 15 with autoimmunity and 15 with 
no autoimmunity after alemtuzumab; Figure 1B). Those with

autoimmunity were found to have more than 2-fold higher serum 
IL-21 levels at all time points after alemtuzumab, compared with 
those without autoimmunity (mean values for month 1, 133.5 pg/
ml vs. 426 pg/ml, P = 0.01; month 3, 119.4 pg/ml vs. 480.5 pg/ml, 
P = 0.008; month 6, 173.9 pg/ml vs. 456.4 pg/ml, P = 0.04; month 
12, 186.7 pg/ml vs. 424.5 pg/ml, P = 0.02). This difference was 
also evident before treatment (mean values, 192.5 pg/ml vs. 505.6 
pg/ml, P = 0.016; Figure 7A). When the analysis was extended to 
include all patients with available pretreatment serum (32 patients 
with autoimmunity, 27 patients without autoimmunity; Figure 
1B), the difference remained, with those developing autoimmu￾nity having more than 2-fold higher serum IL-21 levels than the 
nonautoimmune group (mean values, 206 pg/ml vs. 430 pg/ml, 
P = 0.001). Furthermore, serum IL-21 levels from untreated 
patients with multiple sclerosis (n = 59) were found to be great￾er than controls (n = 19) (327 pg/ml vs. 213 pg/ml, P = 0.041); 
however, this was entirely accounted for by high IL-21 levels in 
those patients who went on to develop secondary autoimmunity 
(Figure 7B). To illustrate how this test might be used clinically, we 
tested the hypothesis that pretreatment serum IL-21 levels above 
an arbitrary threshold of 210 pg/ml predicted autoimmunity after 
alemtuzumab. When applied to the pretreatment samples (n = 59), 
21 of 30 were true positives and 11 of 29 were true negatives, repre￾senting a sensitivity of 66% and specificity of 67%, with a positive 
predictive value of 70% and negative predictive value of 62%.
IL-21 genotype influences IL-21 expression and associates with autoim￾munity. We wanted to know whether serum IL-21 heterogeneity 
was driven by IL-21 genetic polymorphisms. So, in a pilot study, we 
approached all our of local alemtuzumab patients for DNA testing. 
We genotyped all 73 subjects, in whom serum IL-21 concentration 
before alemtuzumab treatment had been determined, for 4 SNPs 
that lie within a block of linkage disequilibrium (LD) on chromo￾some 4q27, encoding the IL21 gene. The minor allele frequency for 
all 4 SNPs was in line with published data: rs13151961G (14.5%), 
rs6822844T (14.6%), rs4833837G (38.0%), and rs6840978T (18.1%) 
(19). We found that the genotype at 3 of the 4 SNPs (rs13151961 
A/A, rs6822844 G/G, and rs6840978 C/C) was associated with sig￾nificantly higher levels of serum IL-21 (P = 0.0076, P = 0.0098, and 
P = 0.0067, respectively). The genotype at rs4833837 did not influ￾ence IL-21 production. The LD between rs4833837 and the 3 other

SNPs is low (r2 < 0.15), therefore, a SNP which lies on the haplo￾type rs13151961(A)-rs6822844(G)-rs6840978(C) is most likely to 
be associated with increased IL-21 production. The genotype fre￾quencies for HLA-DRB1*1501, rs2104286 (IL2RA), and rs6897932 
(IL7R) did not differ from published data for other unselected 
patients with multiple sclerosis (20, 21).
Finally, in order to address whether genotype influences suscepti￾bility to autoimmunity after alemtuzumab, we categorized as many 
patients as possible into those who did (27 subjects) and definitely 
did not (23 subjects) develop autoimmunity after alemtuzumab. 
Twenty-three patients could not be categorized due to transient auto￾antibody production. The genotypes (rs13151961 A/A, rs6822844 
G/G, rs6840978 C/C) shown to be associated with higher serum 
IL-21 concentration tended to associate nonsignificantly with auto￾immunity after alemtuzumab. For the rs13151961 allele, 19 of 31 
(61.3%) of those with the at risk allele (A/A) developed autoimmunity 
versus 7 of 16 (43.8%) without the at-risk allele (P = 0.25). Similar 
values were obtained for the other at-risk alleles. Despite studying all 
possible samples, we recognize that our numbers remain very small 
for a study of genetic risk factors, and therefore, the observed lack of 
statistical significance was not unexpected.
Discussion
Here, we have studied one example of human lymphopenia-asso￾ciated autoimmunity, arising after alemtuzumab treatment of 
multiple sclerosis. We showed that autoimmunity arises in those 
patients with greater T cell apoptosis and cell cycling, driven by 
genetically determined higher levels of IL-21, detectable even before 
treatment. We propose that, by driving cycles of T cell expansion 
and death to excess, IL-21 increases the probability of generating 
self-reactive T cells and, hence, for autoimmunity.
We first described autoimmunity complicating alemtuzumab 
(Campath-1H) treatment in 1999 (3) and have continued to 
observe this complication of what is increasingly recognized as a 
highly effective therapy for early relapsing-remitting multiple scle￾rosis (1–3). The present study, involving a series of small cohorts of 
available patients, was aimed at understanding this unprecedented 
“model” of human autoimmunity.
The association between induced lymphopenia and autoim￾munity is well recognized. Under lymphopenic conditions, the 
remaining T cells undergo extensive compensatory expansion in 
order to reconstitute the immune system. This process, termed 
homeostatic proliferation, relies on stimulation through the TCR–
self peptide–MHC complex (22–24) and so results in a population 
skewed toward increased recognition of self antigen, as seen in this 
study. In addition, rapidly expanding T cells acquire the phenotype 
and functional characteristics of memory cells, including reduced 
dependence on costimulation, the ability to respond to lower doses 
of antigen than naive cells, and the rapid secretion of inflamma￾tory cytokines on restimulation, so further promoting the break￾down of self tolerance (25–28). Yet, despite these changes, autoim￾munity is not an inevitable consequence of lymphopenia. Indeed, 
as with our patients, most lymphopenic subjects do not develop 
autoimmunity, suggesting that additional “cofactors” are required. 
We have already disproved the suggestion that those who develop 
autoimmunity have selective depletion of Tregs (15). Another pos￾sibility arises from the demonstration that excessive cell cycling 
and reduced T cell survival, driven by the overproduction of IL-21, 
underlie the development of diabetes in the NOD mouse (14). Here, 
we demonstrate for what we believe to be the first time in humans 
that overproduction of IL-21 is also the “second hit” required in the 
development of secondary autoimmunity, following otherwise suc￾cessful treatment of multiple sclerosis with alemtuzumab.
In line with previous reports (29–32), we showed that T cells from 
people with untreated multiple sclerosis are resistant to apopto￾sis. Now, we added evidence that this resistance is associated with 
underexpression of caspase-3. Consistent with the position of this 
effector caspase at the convergence point of the extrinsic and intrin￾sic apoptotic pathways, we have demonstrated T cell resistance 
both to Fas-mediated and passive apoptosis in our patients. Under￾expression of caspase-3 has been described in a number of other 
autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes (33), Hashimoto 
thyroiditis, and autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome-2 (34). We 
believe this is, however, a novel finding in multiple sclerosis.
The immune state is radically altered following exposure to 
alemtuzumab. As predicted, T cells regenerating into the lympho￾penic environment generated by alemtuzumab are highly prolif￾erative and skewed toward autoreactivity. However, less intuitively 
but in keeping with observations in the NOD mouse (14), these 
cells are highly unstable and short lived. While their fate has not

previously been directly addressed (14), we show that these cells 
are dying rapidly by apoptosis. High and sustained levels of T cell 
apoptosis may explain why a single dose of alemtuzumab induces 
T cell lymphopenia lasting several years, even though the half-life 
of circulating alemtuzumab is only 6 days, and hematological pre￾cursors are not depleted (35).
Against that background, we showed that patients with second￾ary autoimmunity have higher rates of T cell apoptosis, but no 
greater T cell lymphopenia, than those without autoimmunity, 
suggesting increased cell cycling in this group. These perturba￾tions of T cell cycling were associated with higher serum IL-21 
expression and, in vitro IL-21 was shown to promote both the pro￾liferation and apoptosis of human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Fur￾thermore, susceptibility to lymphopenia-associated autoimmuni￾ty was manifest before lymphodepletion, with pretreatment IL-21 
levels predicting with some accuracy (positive predictive value 
of 70% and negative predictive value of 62%) the development of 
autoimmunity months to years after exposure to alemtuzumab. 
This has major implications for selecting and managing patients 
with multiple sclerosis, when considering lymphocyte-depleting 
therapy with alemtuzumab. IL-21 may promote autoimmunity by 
various mechanisms, including inducing proinflammatory Th17 
cells (36), promoting B cell differentiation and antibody produc￾tion (37, 38), or by reducing the suppressor effect of Tregs (39, 40); 
although other data suggest that IL-21 may, in fact, promote Treg 
function (41). Our position is that by driving cycles of T cell expan￾sion and death to excess, IL-21 increases the stochastic opportuni￾ties for T cells to encounter self antigen and break tolerance, hence 
promoting autoimmunity. This may account for the association 
of a locus on chromosome 4q27, close to the IL2 and IL21 genes, 
with psoriasis (42), celiac disease (43), type 1 diabetes (44), and 
rheumatoid arthritis (45). Despite small patient numbers, we have 
demonstrated that IL-21 production is genetically determined. 
Furthermore, in keeping with our hypotheses, the genotype associ￾ated with high IL-21 production appears to be a risk factor for the 
development of secondary autoimmunity after alemtuzumab.
The preponderance of thyroid disease and autoimmune cytope￾nias seen in our patients and in other examples of reconstitution 
autoimmunity (4–8) is intriguing and is not fully explained. We 
have previously shown that the risk of developing Graves disease 
after alemtuzumab is not associated with a particular HLA type or 
TNF-α or IL-10 promoter polymorphism (3). Furthermore, in the 
CAMMS-223 study, there was no relationship between secondary 
autoimmunity after alemtuzumab and multiple sclerosis disease 
activity (Alasdair J. Coles, personal communication). It remains to 
be explained, therefore, how alemtuzumab switches off one auto￾immune disease, i.e., multiple sclerosis, while rendering patients 
susceptible to novel autoimmunity. One possibility is that the 
profile of autoimmunity arising out of lymphopenia reflects the 
likelihood of a given T cell meeting its cognate antigen. Perhaps, 
by virtue of the blood brain barrier, antigens expressed within the 
central nervous system are less “available” to the immune system 
and are therefore less likely to drive homeostatic reconstitution. 
An alternative suggestion is that multiple sclerosis disease activity, 
unlike ITP and Graves disease, is not driven by IL-21.
In summary, our data provided the first exploration of lym￾phopenia-induced autoimmunity to our knowledge in humans, 
building on and expanding previous experimental studies. They 
provided a conceptual framework for understanding lymphope￾nia-associated autoimmunity that goes beyond the narrow context 
of treating multiple sclerosis with alemtuzumab, which is now in 
phase III trials. The concept is that, first, therapeutic lymphocyte 
depletion and, second, genetically restricted overproduction of 
IL-21 leads to a state of excess T cell cycling and reduced survival, 
which promotes autoimmunity in humans.
Methods
Subjects. All patients had relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and were 
participants in 1 of 2 clinical trials, CAMMS-223 and CAMMS-224 (Cam￾bridge UK Research Ethics Committee [REC 02/315 and 03/078]), in 
which alemtuzumab (supplied by Genzyme) is given by intravenous infu￾sion of 12–24 mg/d for 5 days, followed by retreatment at 12 months. 
Patients and controls consented to venesection for research purposes 
(studies were approved by Cambridge UK Research Ethics Committee 
[LREC 02/263]) and all were free from exposure to other disease-modify￾ing agents, including steroids, for at least 1 month at the time of blood 
sampling. For each experiment, all available samples, from all relevant 
patients, at all possible time points were used; there was no subgroup 
selection. More samples were available for serum studies, as retrospective 
frozen samples could be used. Assays of lymphocyte biology could not be 
performed on many patients shortly after alemtuzumab due to their pro￾found lymphopenia. All DNA samples were collected with informed writ￾ten consent and approval of Thames Valley Multi-centre Research Ethics 
Committee (06/MRE12/11).
Lymphocyte proliferation and apoptosis data were generated by a cross￾sectional study of fresh, ex vivo cells from 65 patients and 21 healthy con￾trols (7 males; mean age, 34 years) (Figure 1A). This generated hypotheses 
about T cell cycling in the pathogenesis of secondary autoimmunity, which 
were tested on samples available at 9 months after alemtuzumab treat￾ment, which was chosen as the earliest time point in which T cell apop￾tosis can be robustly analyzed. Of the 29 samples available at this time 
point, 10 met our study definition of autoimmunity (1 male; mean age, 
36 years), and 10 met our definition of no autoimmunity (3 males; mean 
age, 38 years). Autoimmunity was defined as the development of a novel 
autoimmune disease (with or without autoantibodies) or persistent auto￾antibodies above the normal range (present on at least 2 occasions at least 
3 months apart), without clinical disease. No autoimmunity was defined 
as the absence of an autoimmune disease and autoantibodies for at least 
18 months after alemtuzumab. Of the 10 patients with autoimmunity, 
3 had autoantibodies only (antinuclear antibodies).
Pretreatment serum IL-21 was available on 94 patients (Figure 1B). Of 
these, 27 met the definition of no autoimmunity, and 32 had secondary 
autoimmunity after alemtuzumab (8 with autoantibodies only and 6 with 
antinuclear and 2 with anti–smooth muscle antibodies; 21 with thyroid 
autoimmunity, 2 with ITP, and 1 with Goodpasture disease). The remain￾ing 35 subjects could not be categorized because they produced an auto￾antibody after alemtuzumab transiently. Of the 59 patients who could 
be categorized, serial sera (at 3 monthly intervals after alemtuzumab) 
were available for 30 patients: 15 with autoimmunity (3 males; mean age, 
34 years; 12 with thyroid autoimmunity, 1 with Goodpasture, 1 with ITP, 
and 1 with antinuclear antibodies only) and 15 without autoimmunity 
(5 males; mean age, 31 years). Controls were 19 healthy subjects (7 males; 
mean age, 33 years).
To determine whether serum IL-21 heterogeneity is driven by IL-21 
genetic polymorphisms, all subjects with stored DNA were studied (n = 73) 
(Figure 1C). To determine whether genotype influences susceptibility to 
autoimmunity after alemtuzumab, all 50 subjects who met the definition 
of autoimmunity/no autoimmunity were studied. Of these, 23 had no 
autoimmunity and 27 had secondary autoimmunity after alemtuzumab 
(6 with autoantibodies only, 4 with antinuclear and 2 with anti–smooth

muscle antibodies; 18 with thyroid autoimmunity, 2 with ITP, and 1 with 
Goodpasture disease).
Peripheral mononuclear cell cultures. PBMCs were isolated from heparinized 
blood by centrifugation on a Ficoll-Paque density gradient (Amersham 
Pharmacia Biotech). Whole PBMCs were immediately suspended in cul￾ture medium (RPMI), containing 1% penicillin, 1% streptomycin, and 10% 
fetal calf serum (S5394; Sigma-Aldrich), and adjusted to a concentration 
of 106/ml viable cells (determined by trypan blue exclusion). To induce 
passive cell death, PBMCs were incubated for 72 hours in media alone 
without additional growth factors. Fas-mediated apoptosis was induced 
by culturing PBMCs for 48 hours with soluble anti-CD28 (1 μg/ml; donat￾ed by M. Frewin, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom) in anti￾CD3 monoclonal antibody—precoated plates (1 μg/ml; BD Biosciences — 
Pharmingen), followed by 18 hours incubation with activating anti-human 
Fas (clone CH11, 1 μg/ml; Upstate Biotechnology).
Detection of apoptosis. Apoptotic T cells were detected by staining cells with 
allophycocyanin-conjugated mouse anti-human monoclonal antibodies 
against CD3 (MCA463APC; Serotec), CD4 (MCA1267APC; Serotec), and 
CD8 (MCA1226APC; Serotec) and FITC-conjugated annexin-V and prop￾idium iodide (BD Biosciences — Pharmingen). Fluorescence was detected 
by flow cytometry (FACScalibur; Becton Dickinson). Based on forward and 
side scatter, a wide lymphocyte gate was drawn to include live and apoptotic 
lymphocytes (having reduced forward scatter and increased side scatter). 
At least 15,000 events within the gate were collected and analyzed using 
WinMDI 2.8 software. Early apoptotic cells were defined as annexin-V+
propidium iodide– (annexinV+PI–), and late apoptotic or necrotic cells were 
defined as annexinV+PI+ (46). Apoptotic cell death was defined as total cell 
death (annexinV+PI– plus annexinV+PI+) blocked by pan-caspase inhibition 
with General Caspase Inhibitor Q-VD-OPh (OPH001; R&D Systems).
Proliferation assays. PBMCs were loaded with the cell division tracking dye 
CFSE (47) and cultured with 50 μg/ml MBP (Research Diagnostics Inc.) 
or 1 μg/ml TSHr extracellular domain bound to a matrix binding protein 
(donated by M. Ludgate, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom). 
After 10 days, CFSE staining in cells, identified by specific surface markers 
(CD4, CD8), was analyzed by flow cytometry. Precursor frequency (defined 
as the proportion of lymphocytes that left the parent population to under￾go at least 2 cell divisions) and proliferation index (defined as the sum of 
the cells in all generations divided by the computed number of parent cells) 
were calculated using Modfit LT 3.0 (Verity Software). The absolute num￾ber of surviving cells was measured by comparison with a fixed number of 
inert beads (BD Calibrite; BD Biosciences) included in cultures.
mRNA analysis. PBMCs, immediately ex vivo or after culture with MBP or 
polyclonal stimulation, were positively separated, using 20 μl of magnetic 
beads (CD19 Microbeads, CD3 Microbeads, CD14 Microbeads; Miltenyi 
Biotec) per 1 × 107 cells loaded into a MACS LS Column. Magnetically 
retained cells were eluted, washed, and stored in RNAlater (Ambion) at 
–70°C (cell purity was consistently 95%–98%; data not shown).
Fas, FasL, Bcl-2, Bcl-Xl, Bad, Bax, Bid, Bim, Survivin, c-FLIP, and caspase-3, 
-8, and -9 expression was determined by semiquantitative RT-PCR. mRNA 
was extracted from cells stored in RNAlater using the RNeasy Mini Kit 
(Qiagen) and reverse transcribed to cDNA using the Pro-STAR First-Strand 
RT-PCR Kit (Stratagene). PCR primers and probes were designed using 
Primer Express (PE Biosystems) and purchased from Oswel DNA service. 
mRNA sequence information was obtained from Genbank. Quantita￾tive real-time PCR was performed on an ABI Prism 7900HT Sequence 
Detection System (PerkinElmer), using PCR MasterMix containing ROX 
(RT-QP2X-03; Eurogentec). Primer and probe sequences were as follows:

IL-21 assays and spiking. Serum IL-21 was measured using the eBioscience 
kit (catalog no. 88-7216-86) as per instructions. Plates were read using a 
microplate reader (model 680; Bio-Rad) at 450 nm. Unstimulated and poly￾clonally stimulated (1 μg/ml plate-bound anti-CD3 and 1 μg/ml soluble 
anti-CD28) PBMCs were spiked with 5 pg/ml and 20 pg/ml rhIL-21 (cata￾log no. 14-8219; eBioscience). CD4+ and CD8+ apoptosis and proliferation 
were assessed as described above.
IL-21 genotyping. In total, 4 SNPs, rs13151961, rs6822844, rs4833837, 
and rs6840978, which lie in a region of strong linkage disequilibrium, con￾taining 4 genes, KIAA1109, ADAD1, IL2, IL21, on chromosome 4q27, were 
tested. All 4 SNPs were available as Applied Biosystems Assay-On-Demand 
products. SNP genotyping was performed using Applied Biosystems 
TaqMan methodology according to the manufacturer’s recommended 
conditions. PCR was performed on Applied Biosystems 384-well 9700 
Viper PCR machines, after which genotypes were determined on a 7900HT 
Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems), using Sequence Detec￾tion System Software version 2.1 (Applied Biosystems). Each individual 
was genotyped in duplicate. All individuals were additionally genotyped 
for the multiple sclerosis associated genetic factors HLA-DRB1*1501, 
rs2104286 (IL2RA), and rs6897932 (IL7R).
Statistics. Data were analyzed using SPSS Statistics version 12.0.1 for 
Windows. Following assessment for normality, parametric 2-tailed Stu￾dent’s t tests or nonparametric Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney U tests were 
performed. P values are stated throughout the text; P values of less than 
0.05 were considered as statistically significant, modified by a Bonferroni 
correction where indicated.
