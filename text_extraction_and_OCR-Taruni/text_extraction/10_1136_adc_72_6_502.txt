Abstract
A cross sectional study assessed the bone
mineral density (BMD) of 20 young adult
patients who received a renal transplanta￾tion in childhood. The BMD ofthe lumbar
spine, mainly trabecular bone, and of the
total body, mainly cortical bone, were
measured and expressed as an SD score.
Fourteen patients (70%) had a BMD SD
score of the lumbar spine below -1, of
whom six patients were below -2. Fifteen
patients (75%) had a BMD SD score ofthe
total body below -1, of whom seven
patients were below -2. Both trabecular
and cortical bone appeared to be involved
in the osteopenic process.
The cumulative dose of prednisone was
inversely correlated to both lumbar spine
and total body BMD SD score. In a
multiple regression analysis the cumula￾tive dose of prednisone appeared to be the
only factor with a significant effect on
BMD SD score.
Most young adult patients who had
received a renal transplantation in child￾hood had moderate to severe osteopenia.
Corticosteroid treatment played a major
part in the development of osteopenia in
these patients.

the pathogenesis of renal osteodystrophy.1
Although successful renal transplantation
corrects most metabolic disturbances that cause
renal osteodystrophy, osteopenia remains a
problem.2-5 Bone mass is influenced by
renal osteodystrophy, corticosteroid treatment,
delayed puberty, and diminished physical
activity.2
Most studies evaluating bone mass of renal
transplant recipients involved patients trans￾planted in adulthood.235 These studies showed
a decrease in bone mass after renal transplanta￾tion.
As adolescence is a crucial time for the
development of bone mass6 7 we evaluated the
bone mineral density (BMD) of young adult
patients who received their first renal
transplantation before the age of 16 years. In
addition, we studied the influence of various
factors that could affect bone mass such as
prednisone treatment, age and pubertal stage
at first transplantation, delayed puberty,
number of transplantations, and total duration
of dialysis.
Patients and methods
PATIENTS
Twenty recipients of renal transplants were
studied (13 men and seven women). These
patients met the following criteria: first renal
transplantation before the age of 16 years and
present age between 20 and 30 years. The
clinical data of the patients are summarised in
table 1. Mean chronological age at the time of
the study was 25 years (range 21-29). Mean
age at the first transplantation was 12 1 years

Renal transplantation and osteoporosis
(range 7-1-15-7). The pubertal status at the
time of the first transplantation was stage 1 in
12 patients and stage 2 or more in eight
patients, according to Tanner and
Whitehouse.8 Eleven patients started puberty
later than the 90% confidence interval for
Dutch children and nine patients started
puberty within normal age limits.9
The number of transplantations varied from
one to four. Eleven patients received more than
one renal transplantation. The time since the
first transplantation varied from 9-1 to 17-8
years (mean 14-6 years). Three patients did not
have a functioning renal transplant at the time
of the BMD measurement; two were treated
with haemodialysis (patients 14 and 20 in table
1) and one with peritoneal dialysis (patient 11).
The underlying renal disease was chronic
glomerulonephritis in 10 patients, congenital
renal hypoplasia in four, chronic pyelonephritis
in two, medullary cystic disease in two (brother
and sister), nephronophtisis in one, and an
unclassified granulomatous nephritis in one
patient. Seven patients had a congenital renal
disease.
MEDICATION
The standard immunosuppressive drug regi￾men after renal transplantation included corti￾costeroids in all patients. Acute rejection
episodes were generally treated with three to
five alternate day infusions of methylpred￾nisone (20 mg/kg). At the time of the study 18
patients were on prednisone treatment, four on
alternate days and 14 daily, with doses ranging
from 2 mg on alternate days to 10 mg daily.
The individual cumulative dose of pred￾nisone/kg body weight was calculated from the
time of the first renal transplantation until the
BMD measurement. The total duration of
prednisone treatment from the first renal trans￾plantation until the BMD measurement, the
percentage of time on alternate day prednisone
treatment, the number of acute rejection
episodes, and the total duration of dialysis
before and between renal transplantations
were determined.
MEASUREMENTS
The height was measured by a fixed wall
stadiometer and expressed as SD score com￾pared with Dutch sex and age matched refer￾ence values.9 The body mass index was
calculated as weight divided by square height
(kg/iM2) and was also expressed as the SD
score.10 The BMD of the lumbar vertebrae
L2-L4 and of the total body was measured by
dual energy x ray absorptiometry (DXA, model
DPX-L, Lunar Corporation).11 BMD is
expressed as g hydroxyapatite/cm2. The coeffi￾cient of variation (SD) was 1 1 (0-2)%. The
BMD results of the lumbar spine and total body
were converted to a SD score by comparing the
results with a British reference population of sex
and age matched young adults, provided by the
Lunar Corporation. This reference group was
used in the statistical analysis. The British
lumbar spine reference data didn't differ from
lumbar spine BMD measurements of a smaller
Dutch reference sample.'2
Approval of the ethics committee of the
University Hospital Rotterdam and informed
consent of the participants of the study were
obtained.
STATISTICAL ANALYSES
Student's t tests were used to compare inter￾group differences. We used simple linear
regression analysis to assess a correlation
between a continuous factor and BMD SD
score. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient
was used for covariables that were not nor￾mally distributed. Multiple regression analysis
(stepwise forward selection) was performed to
determine the effect of the factors that had a
significant effect in univariate analysis on
BMD SD score simultaneously. All tests were
performed for both lumbar spine and total
body BMD SD score.
Results
Fourteen patients (70%) had a SD score of the
BMD of the lumbar spine below -1, of whom
six were below -2. The mean SD score of the
BMD of the lumbar spine of the patients was
-1-7 (range -4-1 to 0 2), which is significant
below zero (p<0Q001). Fifteen patients (75%)
had a SD score of the BMD of the total body
below -1, of whom seven patients were below
-2. The mean SD score of the BMD of the
total body was -1-6 (range -3 9 to 0 8),
significant below zero (p<0 00 1).
The individual results of the 20 patients are
summarised in table 1. The correlation coeffi￾cient between BMD SD score of lumbar spine
and total body was 0*80 (p<0 001). Twelve
patients had a BMD SD score below -1 of
lumbar spine as well as total body; five patients
had a BMD SD score below -2 of both
measurements.
The results of simple linear regression analy￾ses are summarised in table 2. The relation
between cumulative dose of prednisone and
BMD SD score is illustrated in the figure.
The equation for the BMD SD score of the
total body was as follows: BMD SD
score=0-337- 1-74 (SE 0-41)Xcumulative
dose of prednisone (g/kg), which means that 1
g prednisone/kg body weight reduced the SD
score of the total body BMD by 1P74. For the
lumbar spine BMD SD score this reduction
was 1-23 (SE 0-47). There was no correlation
between the BMD SD score and the percent￾age of time on alternate day prednisone treat￾ment. Although the mean final height SD score
was markedly reduced (mean -2 5), the mean
body mass index SD score did not differ from
average (mean 0-1). Thirteen patients (65%)
had a height SD score below -2. There was a
significant positive correlation between height
SD score and BMD SD score of
both measurements and between body mass
index SD score and total body BMD SD score.
The patients who received the first renal
transplantation at Tanner stage 1 (n= 12) had
a lower mean (SE) BMD SD score than the

patients who had started puberty at the time of
the first renal transplantation: -2-12 (0 30) v
-0-93 (0.45), p=0-032 for total body BMD
SD score and -1-97 (0-33) v -125 (0-41) for
lumbar spine BMD SD score. There is, how￾ever, a significant difference in cumulative
dose of prednisone between the two groups.
The 11 patients with delayed puberty had a
lower mean (SE) BMD SD score than the nine
patients who had started puberty at normal
time, -2-03 (0-38) and -1d16 (0 38) respec￾tively for the total body, -2-01 (0-39) and
-1-27 (0-32) respectively for the lumbar spine,
although this difference was not statistically
significant.
Factors without significant effect on BMD
SD score in a simple linear regression model
were: gender, number of transplantations,
dialysis at the time of the measurement, age at
first renal transplantation, years since the
transplantation, duration of dialysis, current
prednisone dose, total duration of prednisone
treatment, total number of acute rejection
episodes, and either acquired or congenital
renal disease.
Stepwise forward selection with BMD SD
score of the total body or lumbar spine as
dependent variable resulted in a model only
containing a cumulative dose of prednisone.
The pubertal stage at the time of the transplan￾tation, delayed puberty, body mass index SD
score, and height SD score had no additional
significant effect on BMD SD score.
Discussion
Our study indicates that most young adult
patients who had received a renal transplanta￾tion in childhood had moderately to severely
decreased BMD. This is the first study with
such a long follow up.
These patients were aged between 20 and 30
years at the time of the study. Healthy
individuals have their maximal BMD at this
age.6 It has been reported that every 1 SD
reduction in bone mass gives an approximate
doubling of fracture risk in postmenopausal
women.13 Differences of 2 SD in bone mass of
the lumbar spine, radius, or calcaneus were
associated with fourfold to sixfold increases in
the risk for vertebral fractures in post￾menopausal women.14
Thirty per cent of our patients had significant
osteopenia of the lumbar spine, BMD more
than 2 SD below the mean, and 35% of the
patients had osteopenia of the total body. The
lumbar spine is mainly composed of trabecular
bone and the bone of the total body is mainly
composed of cortical bone (80% cortical bone v
20% trabecular bone).15 As corticosteroid
induced osteoporosis mainly affects trabecular
bone16'9 and hyperparathyroidism mainly
affects cortical bone,20 both these factors appear
to be involved in the osteopenic process.
Other studies reported significant bone loss
directly after renal transplantation in adult
patients.2 3 Progressive loss of BMD of the
lumbar spine and femoral neck, measured by
DXA, was found in 26 adult patients during
the first six months after renal transplantation.2
Likewise Julian et al found that the mean BMD
of the vertebrae, measured by dual photon
absorptiometry, of 20 adult patients had
decreased by 8-8% 18 months after transplan￾tation.3 The mean spinal BMD was 1-17 SD
below normal at the time of transplantation. In
this study the BMD of the radial shaft, mostly
cortical bone, had increased significantly six
months after transplantation from -07 to
-0 3 SD score. This may reflect a resolution of
secondary hyperparathyroidism. This increase
is in contrast to what was found by Kwan et al.2
We measured bone mass nine to 17 years after
renal transplantation and found that the mean
SD score for cortical BMD was -1I 6, signifi￾cantly below controls.
Significant osteopenia of the radius, ulna,
and humerus was measured in 1 1 of 18
children, aged 4 to 18 years, who had received
a renal transplant six months to eight years
before, using single photon absorptiometry.4

Renal transplantation and osteoporosis 505
affect calcium homoeostasis. Glucocorticoids
decrease bone formation and increase bone
resorption,'6 17 mainly of trabecular bone.
Intestinal calcium absorption is reduced and
renal calcium excretion is increased. We found
a significant negative correlation between the
cumulative dose of prednisone and both
lumbar and total body BMD. Dykman et al
found that the effect of long term glucocorti￾coid treatment in various regimens may result
in glucocorticoid induced osteopenia and this
effect was cumulative.'8 Both daily16 19 and
alternate day2l corticosteroid treatment cause
bone loss. Chesney et al found that the children
receiving daily prednisone treatment had a
significantly lower bone mineral content than
those receiving alternate day treatment.4
In addition to renal osteodystrophy and
corticosteroids a delay of puberty may
contribute to the development of postrenal
transplantation osteopenia. Late puberty is
common in children after renal transplanta￾tion.22 In our study 11 of the 20 patients (55%)
had a late start of puberty and their BMD SD
score tended to be lower than the patients who
started puberty at a normal age. Bone mass
increases with age throughout childhood
reaching the peak bone mass by late adoles￾cence or early adulthood.23-26 Bone mass
accretion during puberty appears to be critical
in the development of peak bone mass.27 Peak
bone mass is regarded as a major determinant
of osteoporosis in later life.7 Healthy men who
had late puberty (the onset of puberty after 15
years of age) had a significant lower BMD of
the radius and lumbar spine than men who had
their puberty at a normal age.28
In 65% of the patients from this study the
final height was more than 2 SD below the
mean. This is in accordance with the study of
Hokken-Koelega et al showing that in 77% of
the males and 71% of the females the final
height remained below the third centile
(<-1-88 SD). 29 These patients received their
first renal transplant before the age of 15.
We found a positive correlation between the
height SD score and BMD SD score. Growth
may be influenced by the same factors as the
bone mass. Some authors described that the
method of DXA to measure BMD was influ￾enced by bone size and by calculating the
volumetric density, using hypothetical models
of the vertebral column, the confounding effect
of bone size could be reduced.30 31 However,
Mazess et al demonstrated that the BMD
measured by dual photon absorptiometry,
which differed from DXA only in the radiation
source, correlated well with the quantitative
computer scan density of both the total verte￾brae (r=0.89) and that of the entire body
(r=0 86).32 The quantitative computer scan
measures the volumetric density. In a study of
total body BMD in normal women, multiple
linear regression revealed that height did not
have a statistically significant influence on the
BMD.33 We propose that the correlation
between height and BMD cannot be explained
by the technique used but that both BMD and
height were negatively influenced. Multiple
regression analysis revealed that the cumulative
dose of prednisone had the most important
negative influence on BMD. This may have
influenced the final height as well.
We found a significant positive correlation
between the body mass index SD score and
total body BMD SD score. In healthy adults
weight and body mass index had a positive
effect on femur and spine BMD,34 probably
due to load on weight bearing bones.
Our results showed that patients who had
received a renal transplantation in childhood
had a significantly reduced BMD. In multiple
regression analysis only the cumulative dose of
prednisone appeared to have a significant
effect on BMD. Children who receive a renal
transplantation have a highly increased risk
of developing osteoporosis. Glucocorticoid
sparing immunosuppressive regimens might
reduce osteopenia after transplantation.
