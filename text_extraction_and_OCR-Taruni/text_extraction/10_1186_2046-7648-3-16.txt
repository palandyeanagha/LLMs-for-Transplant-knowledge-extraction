Fluid therapy in critical illness
Mark R Edwards1,2* and Michael G Mythen3,4,5
Abstract
Major surgery and critical illnesses such as sepsis and trauma all disturb normal physiological fluid handling.
Intravenous fluid therapy for resuscitation and fluid maintenance is a central part of medical care during these
conditions, yet the evidence base supporting practice in this area lacks answers to a number of important
questions. Recent research developments include a refinement of our knowledge of the endothelial barrier
structure and function and a focus on the potential harm that may be associated with intravenous fluid therapy.
Here, we briefly describe the contemporary view of fluid physiology and how this may be disrupted by pathological
processes. The important themes in critical illness fluid research are discussed, with a particular focus on two emerging
ideas: firstly, that individualising fluid treatment to the patient, their underlying disease state and the phase of that
illness may be key to improving clinical outcomes using fluid interventions and, secondly, that fluids should be
considered to be drugs, with specific indications and contraindications, dose ranges and potential toxicities.

Review
Background
Disturbances of body fluid homeostasis are common in
major surgery and a range of critical illnesses including
sepsis and trauma. Administering appropriate intraven￾ous fluid is a core part of medical care during these epi￾sodes. Despite years of research, there is still widespread
debate about the best dosing strategy for these fluids
and the optimum fluid composition for a given clinical
situation. These are still important research questions,
as there are clear signs from the current literature that
fluid administration strategies have the power to affect
clinical outcomes in a variety of areas.
Our study of fluid therapy is being refined by recent
advances in basic physiology research. In particular, our
knowledge of the structure of the vascular endothelium
and the way in which fluid is handled at a capillary level
has recently been redeveloped. There has also been pro￾gress in pharmacokinetic modelling of the movement of
exogenous fluids between the body's fluid compart￾ments. At the other end of the research spectrum, clin￾ical fluid trials are becoming ever larger in an effort to
address the limitations of the preceding literature, which
is based predominantly on relatively small, single-centre
studies.
Some key themes have emerged from this body of re￾search. Firstly, it is increasingly clear that clinical context
is key to the success or failure of a given fluid strategy.
A fluid strategy which appears to reduce morbidity in
one clinical population (e.g. patients undergoing major
surgery) may actually be harmful to another (patients with
established sepsis). Fluid therapies are being increasingly
tailored to very tightly defined clinical subgroups and
indeed to individual patients and the stage of their clinical
course. A further theme is the emergence of toxicities
related to fluid composition which have only become
apparent through large clinical trials. Fluids are there￾fore increasingly being seen as drugs, with specific
indications, contraindications and dose ranges [1].
In this review, we will outline the contemporary model
of normal physiological fluid handling. The effects of
a range of extreme physiological situations will be
described, including acute haemorrhage and systemic
inflammation. We will then review the latest literature
in relation to clinical fluid strategies in a number of
clinical settings Table 1.

adipose tissue, this proportion varies widely with obesity
(as low as 45%), age (higher in childhood, reducing to
approximately 50% in the elderly) and sex (50% in an
average adult female). Body water occupies functional
and anatomical compartments. Fluid within cells—the
intracellular compartment—is separated from the extra￾cellular compartment by the cell membrane. This is im￾permeable to large hydrophilic molecules and charged
particles, although these may cross it by specific trans￾port mechanisms.
A proportion of extracellular water is contained within
the bone and dense connective tissue, although due to
slow kinetics this is viewed as non-functional. The extra￾cellular compartment is further divided into interstitial
fluid between cells and in lymphatics, intravascular fluid
within blood vessels, and transcellular fluid including
gastrointestinal secretions, joint fluid, cerebrospinal fluid
and pleural, peritoneal and pericardial fluid.
The vascular endothelium is the key barrier between
the intravascular and interstitial spaces. It is particularly
relevant clinically as it can be damaged during patho￾physiological states such as inflammation, allowing po￾tentially harmful fluid accumulation in the interstitial
space. The vascular endothelium in a typical capillary is
composed of a single layer of endothelial cells with inter￾cellular clefts closed by tight junctions. The cells sit on a
continuous basement membrane. On the vascular aspect
of the endothelial cells lies a continuous layer of glycos￾aminoglycan chains, membrane-bound proteoglycans
and glycoproteins. These form the endothelial glycocalyx
layer (EGL), which is approximately 1 μm thick.
Water and electrolytes can pass freely across the
glycocalyx and then beyond the endothelial cells via the
intercellular clefts. Proteins and other large molecules
however are unable to pass through an intact glycocalyx
and are transported in relatively small quantities across
the endothelial cells by active processes. The EGL is
therefore still part of the intravascular space but con￾tains up to 700–1,000 ml of almost protein-free fluid
with the same electrolyte composition as plasma. This
creates a large protein concentration gradient—and
oncotic pressure gradient—between the plasma and the
space immediately below the EGL. This opposes the
hydrostatic pressure gradient at the arteriolar end of
capillaries, reducing the volume of water and electrolytes
filtered out of the capillary. Net filtration across a ca￾pillary is expressed by the modified Starling equation
(Figure 1).
Pathophysiology of fluid homeostasis in critical illness
A wide variety of illnesses cause disturbances in fluid
balance. This is usually due to inadequate or excessive
volume in one or more functional fluid compartments,
which may be associated with a disturbance in the
barrier between those compartments.
Dehydration is a reduction in the water—and possibly
sodium—content in all fluid compartments. It is a
feature of excessive fluid loss through the skin (pyrexia,
sweating), gastrointestinal tract (vomiting, diarrhoea,
bowel obstruction) or kidneys (osmotic diuresis or poly￾uric renal failure) without adequate replacement.
Acute blood loss causes a sudden reduction in intra￾vascular volume, cardiac filling and cardiac output. The
transient reduction in arterial pressure is rapidly sensed
by the high-pressure baroreceptors in the aortic arch
and carotid sinus. The resultant sympathetic activation
results in vasoconstriction, increased cardiac inotropy
and increased heart rate. A range of other neurohumoral
Table 1 Fluid therapy terminology
Term Summary
Osmotic and oncotic
pressure
— osmotic pressure is the hydrostatic pressure
that would be required to resist the diffusion
of water across a semipermeable membrane
from a higher solute concentration to a lower
solute concentration. Oncotic pressure is the
portion of osmotic pressure which is due to
large molecular weight particles, particularly
proteins.
Fluid tonicity — the effective osmolality of a solution in
relation to a specific semipermeable
membrane and therefore a useful way of
describing a given fluid's in vivo behaviour. For
example, although 5% dextrose has a similar ex
vivo osmolality to 0.9% sodium chloride, after
infusion the dextrose is taken up into cells,
rendering the solution effectively hypo￾osmolar with respect to the cell membrane, i.e.
hypotonic; 0.9% sodium chloride remains
isotonic due to the retention of sodium and
chloride ions in the extracellular space.
Crystalloid — solutions of glucose and/or electrolytes in
water.
Colloid — a dispersion of large molecules or
ultramicroscopic non-crystalline particles in a
carrier crystalloid. It includes gelatins, starches
and dextrans.
Balanced solutions — those with a composition more similar to
plasma than to 0.9% sodium chloride. It is
achieved by replacing a proportion of the
chloride with stable organic anionic buffers
such as lactate, gluconate or acetate.
Goal-directed
haemodynamic therapy
— the use of cardiac output monitoring to
guide fluid and inotrope therapy. Key
physiological goals are targeted in specific
treatment algorithms. This may be a
predefined increase in global oxygen delivery
or stepwise increases to wards a maximal
cardiac stroke volume. This treatment—as
compared with fluid dosing based on clinical
assessment or ‘per weight’ basis—has been
used in various forms for over 40 years. Early
variants were guided by the pulmonary artery
catheter, but several minimally invasive devices
are now in use.

mechanisms are activated, including the renin￾angiotensin-aldosterone axis and antidiuretic hormone
release. These further contribute to vasoconstriction,
reduction in glomerular filtration rate and renal retention
of salt and water to compensate for the acute volume loss.
These early mechanisms may initially result in ap￾parently normal haemodynamic observations. However,
these responses divert blood away from ‘non-essential’
organs (kidney, gut, liver, skin) and towards essential or￾gans (brain, heart). Healthy volunteer experiments have
demonstrated signs of critical organ hypoperfusion, mea￾sured by a reduction in gut pH, despite normal-range
blood pressure and heart rate after up to 30% blood vol￾ume loss [3]. This subclinical gut hypoperfusion may be
a potent inflammatory stimulus, as reduced gut barrier
function allows translocation of bacterial endotoxin into
the systemic circulation [4,5].
Acutely reduced capillary pressure, seen in blood loss
or due to widespread vasodilatation due to sepsis or
anaesthesia, alters fluid movement at the capillary
level also. In the initial phase, there may be an
‘autotransfusion’ of interstitial fluid into the intravascular
space, although this is limited to approximately 500 ml
[6]. Ongoing reduced capillary pressure reduces net
filtration of fluid out of the intravascular space, and this
state is maintained until capillary pressure returns to
normal [6].
Fluid homeostasis becomes even more disturbed if the
endothelium becomes damaged and loses its barrier func￾tion. A range of insults has been associated with degrad￾ation of the glycocalyx, including inflammatory mediators
[7] or even natriuretic peptides associated with acute
iatrogenic hypervolaemia [8]. Systemic inflammation also
leads to an altered endothelial cell phenotype and in￾creased endothelial pore size. This endothelial dysfunction
allows the loss of proteins into the interstitial space, ac￾companied by excess water. This overloads the lymphatic
system and results in oedema within the compliant tissues
such as connective tissue, lungs and gut. The loss of
plasma proteins and oncotic pressure also aggravates
excessive capillary filtration, causing hypovolaemia and
organ dysfunction.
The clinical management of intravenous fluid adminis￾tration therefore has the potential to influence organ
function, morbidity and mortality in pathophysiological
settings. If fluid replacement is inadequate during critical
illness, inadequate organ blood flow and therefore
inadequate delivery of oxygen and energy substrates may
occur. This results in inefficient anaerobic cellular me￾tabolism and in severe cases cell death and organ failure.
Conversely, excessive salt and water administration,
particularly in the setting of endothelial dysfunction,
may worsen organ oxygenation and function through
oedema formation.
Again, the capillary handling of administered intraven￾ous fluids is critical and has recently been re-examined.
Free water contained in hypotonic solutions distributes
evenly throughout all fluid compartments, leaving only a
small proportion within the intravascular space. Trad￾itionally, isotonic electrolyte solutions were thought to
distribute evenly through the extracellular (intravascular
and interstitial) space only, leaving approximately 20%–
25% of their volume in the intravascular space. Colloids,
due to their superior oncotic pressure, were thought to
initially remain almost completely within the intravascu￾lar space and were seen as the best fluid for acute plas￾ma volume expansion.
It is now proposed that the ‘context’ of capillary pres￾sure is important [2]. At low capillary pressures, infusion
of colloid will expand the plasma volume, but the large
molecules should not pass beyond an intact glycocalyx.
Crystalloid infusions will expand the entire intravascular
volume, i.e. both plasma and EGL. In both cases, net ca￾pillary filtration will remain close to zero until capillary
hydrostatic pressure becomes normal or supra-normal.
Figure 1 The revised Starling principle and equation. Hydrostatic
pressures are higher within the vascular lumen (Pv) than within the
interstitium (Pi
), favouring outward fluid filtration. The endothelial
surface layer (ESL) is formed by the endothelial glycocalyx (EG), which
binds plasma proteins and excludes them from the subglycocalyx layer
(S). This forms an oncotic gradient from the low protein concentration
of the subglycocalyx (IIs) to the intravascular space (IIv). This gradient
opposes outward fluid filtration. Net transcapillary flow (Jv)—dashed
arrows—can be expressed using the revised Starling equation: Jv =
Kf
([Pv − Pi
] − σ[πv − πs]), where Kf is the filtration coefficient and σ is
the reflection coefficient (the degree to which the tendency of a
macromolecule to cross the endothelial barrier is resisted). EC,

This may help to explain the observation in numerous
clinical studies that similar resuscitation end points can
be achieved using 50% more crystalloid than colloid, ra￾ther than the much larger crystalloid volumes tradition￾ally predicted [9-11]. Pharmacokinetic studies have also
demonstrated that in anaesthetised patients—with pre￾sumably low capillary pressure—around 60% of an iso￾tonic crystalloid solution is retained in the circulation
during the infusion, as redistribution to other compart￾ments takes 20–25 min [12].
For both fluid types, in the setting of normal or supra￾normal capillary pressure, net filtration will occur, with
loss of fluid from the intravascular space and the poten￾tial for oedema formation. Although in health the main￾tained oncotic pressure associated with colloids helps to
limit this filtration, this effect is reduced in the presence
of endothelial dysfunction. Here, there is the potential
for large colloid molecules to pass freely into the inter￾stitial space. However, as more crystalloid volume is
needed to achieve similar resuscitation endpoints to col￾loids, patients resuscitated with crystalloid do ultimately
gain a more positive fluid balance [13] Table 1.
Therapeutic fluid strategies and clinical outcome
As a core part of medical treatment during acute illness
and trauma, it is not surprising that a number of fluid
administration strategies have been trialled in various
clinical settings over the years. This evidence base has
shown that fluid strategies have the potential to influ￾ence morbidity and possibly mortality outcomes after
critical illness and major surgery. However, clear-cut an￾swers which can be confidently translated to widespread
clinical practice are rare. A summary of some of the crit￾ical illness fluid research areas is contained in Table 2.
There are a number of challenges which have
hampered evidence-based practice in this area. Firstly,
fluid therapy is a prime example of what the Medical Re￾search Council terms a ‘complex intervention’ [39]. This
complexity lies at multiple levels, from the biological
interaction between administered fluid and the patho￾physiological setting, through the interaction of the clin￾ician with choice of fluid, monitoring and therapeutic
strategy, to clinician beliefs, resource limitations, health￾care systems, guidelines and financial incentives which
may promote or inhibit the adoption of certain fluid
interventions.
One example of this complexity leading to ongoing
uncertainty is in fluid strategies around the time of major
surgery. An approach to haemodynamic therapy, based on
targeting supra-normal global oxygen delivery—moni￾tored using the pulmonary artery catheter—was initially
investigated in the 1970s [20,40]. Despite early promise,
controversy developed over the safety of pulmonary artery
catheters though a number of clinical trials [41]. By the
1990s, they had fallen out of widespread use. New goal￾directed haemodynamic therapy strategies using less inva￾sive technologies such as the transoesophageal Doppler
monitor were therefore developed and tested. However,
the evidence of benefit was accrued slowly through a
number of single-centre trials, and it was not until 2011
that the National Institute for Clinical Excellence recom￾mended their use in UK peri-operative practice [42].
Despite this, widespread uptake into clinical practice was
limited. Financial incentives through ‘quality payments’
have been used in an attempt to promote the technology
in the UK. However, in the intervening decades, changes
in surgical practices and care pathways have developed,
reducing baseline morbidity and mortality. Despite nearly
40 years of research, it therefore remains uncertain whe￾ther goal-directed haemodynamic therapy is beneficial for
contemporary surgical populations. Increasingly large￾scale trials are currently in progress or development in
order to provide a definitive answer to this question.
Even at a basic physiological, pathological and pharma￾cological level, there is considerable complexity which
may be important in fluid therapy. The mechanisms of
action of fluid strategies at an organ and cellular level have
been relatively under-explored in relevant human clinical
settings. This gap in the knowledge base may help to
explain the variable success of many fluid clinical trials.
The ultimate goals of fluid therapy are to provide enough
circulating volume and blood flow to organs, so that the
quantities of oxygen and nutrients delivered are sufficient
to meet their metabolic requirements, while avoiding iat￾rogenic harm through excess dosing of water, electrolytes
or exogenous compounds. Yet this apparent simplicity be￾lies the biological complexity of achieving these goals
in diverse disease settings. The clinical benefit or harm
brought by administering fluids may result from fluid
composition, dose, physiological target, timing during the
illness, or complex interactions between these factors, the
patient's pre-morbid phenotype and the acute but ever￾changing pathophysiological processes.
Developing the evidence base behind critical illness
fluid practices further therefore needs a combination of
basic science, translational trials and clinical trials.
Controlled trials with large sample sizes are necessary to
definitively detect differences in outcome which may be
small but important when applied to the huge number
of patients undergoing major surgery or critical illness.
But achieving this size often requires pragmatic trial
design and heterogeneous groups (e.g. ‘all major surgical
patients’ or ‘all critical care patients’) which potentially
obscure the nuances of which individual patients might
get benefit or harm and when. More mechanistic studies
are needed to explore what aspect(s) of the interven￾tion strategy brought the benefit or harm and to address
apparently basic but as-yet unanswered questions, such as

Table 2 Key themes in critical illness fluid research
Patient
group
Research question Early trial evidence Subsequent developments and ongoing
research questions
Sepsis Does early goal-directed bolus
fluid therapy improve survival
from severe sepsis?
Key single-centre study by Rivers showing
reduced mortality when bolus fluid therapy
targeting central venous pressure and mixed
venous saturations was used at presentation of
septic patients to hospital [14].
Further developments in sepsis care
through treatment ‘bundles’ and the need
to test the intervention have led to a re￾appraisal of the benefits of this intervention.
The ProCESS trial recently published
comparing protocol-driven goal-directed
therapy with protocol (but not goal￾directed) therapy and with standard care in
1,341 patients. No differences in mortality at
60, 90 or 365 days [15]. Further multicentre
trials based on River's original protocol are
nearing completion in the UK (ProMISe) and
Australasia (ARiSE).
Mixed
critical care
populations
Is fluid composition used for
resuscitation associated with acute
kidney injury and increased
mortality?
Early starch-based colloids with high molecular
weight were associated with renal dysfunction
[16]. Lower molecular weight starches were
brought to market based on efficacy data but
without trials large enough to detect possible
harm.
A number of large trials have demonstrated an
increase in the need for renal replacement
therapy with modern starches, when compared
to isotonic crystalloids. This has been shown in
both septic [17,18] and mixed critical care [13]
populations. Despite concerns over trial
methods, for example that some patients had
been partially resuscitated before trial entry, use
of starches has now been restricted (USA,
Europe) or stopped (UK). A recent network
meta-analysis has suggested that renal
replacement requirement is highest in
association with starches, followed by isotonic
saline then balanced crystalloids [19].
Surgery Does goal-directed
haemodynamic therapy improve
outcomes for patients undergoing
major surgery?
Survivors of high-risk surgery were found to
achieve higher global oxygen delivery levels
than non-survivors. These ‘survivor values’ were
then used as therapeutic targets in subsequent
interventional trials, with benefit shown [20,21].
Reduced popularity of the pulmonary artery
catheter followed by minimally invasive cardiac
output monitors and an evolution of fluid
administration protocols. Single-centre trials
from the 1990s onwards showed reduction in
hospital length of stay and postoperative
morbidity in goal-directed therapy intervention
groups. A recent Cochrane review points to no
harm and probably morbidity benefit from goal￾directed therapy, although studies span over
30 years of trials [22]. A large contemporary
multicentre trial also involving an inotrope in
the intervention group (OPTIMISE) again
suggested benefit but lacked statistical
significance. The accompanying update to the
meta-analysis strengthens the evidence for a
reduction in postoperative morbidity [23].
Studies in emergency surgery are lacking.
Surgery Can targeting a fluid ‘dose’ lead to
improved outcomes in patients
undergoing major surgery?
Patients receiving ‘standard’ volumes of fluid in
the peri-operative phase were shown to have
more postoperative morbidity than those
receiving ‘restrictive’ volumes [24].
This research theme has been hampered by
varying definitions of what constitutes liberal
and restrictive volumes of fluid. Subsequent
trials have therefore shown contrasting results. A
common theme though is the association
between a positive fluid balance in the
immediate peri-operative period (>3,500–
5,000 ml) and worse postoperative outcomes.
Giving larger volumes of fluid without robust
physiological monitoring appears to be
associated with worse outcomes, even when
overall quantities given may be similar to those
used in goal-directed therapy interventions [25].
A large and hopefully definitive multicentre trial
(RELIEF) is underway in Australasia and the UK.
Surgery Does isotonic saline cause harm to
patients undergoing surgery when
compared with balanced
solutions?
Concerns that isotonic saline is unphysiological
in composition and may cause harm through
reduction in renal blood flow and
hyperchloraemic acidosis. These have never
Observational studies suggest harm with saline
as compared to balanced solutions [26,27]. A
Cochrane review suggests an increase in

how the body handles the currently available range of
exogenously administered anions.
Individualisation of fluid strategies
It is implausible that one fluid administration strategy
will ever be beneficial to all patients in all clinical
settings at all time points in their critical illness or
physiological insult. There is an increasing realisation
that trial findings in one group cannot be readily extrap￾olated to other groups. The theme of ‘individualisa￾tion’—tailoring fluid interventions to each patient and
each setting—is gaining momentum and is seen in the
following areas.
Patient: tailoring to patient physiology
Goal-directed haemodynamic therapy in patients under￾going major surgery is a longstanding example of adapt￾ing fluid dosing to a patient's baseline physiology. This is
also true of contemporary algorithms aimed at optimis￾ing cardiac stroke volume. These involve a physiological
‘test’ in the form of a fluid bolus with ongoing moni￾toring of stroke volume. If the patient is fluid replete—
or cardiac performance is beyond the optimum point of
the Starling curve—there will be no further increase in
stroke volume and fluid bolus administration can stop.
This is in contrast to other dosing strategies based on
patient weight or physiological signs which are poor at
predicting a response to fluid.
Timing: tailoring the fluid strategy to the
pathophysiological phase
There is growing evidence that the timing of plasma vol￾ume expansion is important in its potential success. This
may be seen even within the relatively short time frame
of a surgical operation. One study showed that despite
only modest differences in the overall volume of fluid
given to patients undergoing surgery, the use of cardiac
output monitoring to guide fluid input led to fluid being
given earlier in the operation, which led to sustained in￾creases in cardiac output not seen in the control group
[43]. This was associated with a reduction in postopera￾tive morbidity. More broadly, initial studies pointed to
potential benefits of goal-directed fluid resuscitation early
in severe sepsis [14], whereas later aggressive fluid admin￾istration during established critical illness appears to be
harmful [44-46]. Differences in the time of entry into clin￾ical trials of fluid resuscitation may also explain differing
messages about potential harm from colloids used for
volume expansion [13,47].
The differing physiological requirements from fluid
therapy during the developing stages of critical illness
and circulatory shock have been recognised in a new
proposed treatment approach [48]:
 Salvage phase—the immediate phase where fluid
resuscitation is used as a lifesaving measure, guided
by immediately available information such as clinical
assessment, blood pressure and heart rate

statistical power.
in the peri-operative setting [28]. No increase in
postoperative renal morbidity. However, there is
a lack of high-quality large trials, and this remains
an important topic for ongoing research.
Trauma Does limiting volumes of early
resuscitation fluid improve
outcomes from trauma?
Early suggestions from battlefield that fluid
resuscitation may be harmful in ‘wound shock’
[29]. Renewed interest following pre-hospital
randomised trial in penetrating trauma showing
reduced mortality in limited vs. standard
resuscitation [30].
Permissive hypotension with limited volumes of
clear fluid given prior to achieving haemostasis
is proposed as a part of ‘damage control
resuscitation’ [31]. This also includes early
surgical or radiological control of haemorrhage
and steps to limit coagulopathy, including
tranexamic acid and high ratios of plasma and
platelets to red blood cell units transfused [32].
Controversy remains about the place of limited
volume early resuscitation, as follow-up trials
have not shown in-hospital or 30-day mortality
benefit when blunt trauma patients are included
[33,34]. Hypotension may also worsen co￾existing brain injury [35].
Trauma Does hypertonic saline improve
outcomes from trauma?
Hypertonic solutions may have the ability to
draw water from the intracellular to the
extracellular compartment, achieving plasma
volume expansion with minimal volume of fluid
administered.
Limited human studies examining hypertonic
saline used early in trauma resuscitation. One
large trial stopped early as interim analysis
demonstrated futility [36]. Hypertonic solutions
not routinely recommended in trauma
resuscitation. Although hypertonic saline is
effective at reducing raised intracranial pressure
[37], there is no benefit in early traumatic brain
injury when intracranial pressure is not
monitored [38].

 Optimisation phase—guided by more in-depth
monitoring, and aiming to optimise global oxygen
delivery, with resultant improvements in arterial
lactate and mixed venous blood desaturation
 Stabilisation phase—a more cautious approach to
fluid administration, aiming to minimise iatrogenic
harm caused by fluid overload and institute more
general organ support where required
 De-escalation phase—appropriate during the start of
resolution of critical illness, aiming to reduce
vasoactive treatments and achieve a negative fluid
balance
Disease: tailoring fluid strategy to the underlying
pathophysiology
A number of clinical syndromes (‘critical illness’ or ‘cir￾culatory shock’) appear to have common features which
may be addressed by similar fluid approaches. Yet the
underlying disease process seems to be critical to the
benefit or harm brought by these fluid strategies. In
mixed critical care populations, including severe sepsis,
there is growing evidence that starch-based colloids are
associated with an increased requirement for renal re￾placement therapy [17,18]. This has led to restrictions
on the licences for these products. In contrast, many of
the trials showing the benefits of goal-directed haemo￾dynamic therapy in major surgical patients have used
colloids—including starches—for their intervention fluid
boluses.
Another example of this is the Saline vs. Albumin
Fluid Evaluation (SAFE) study, a large multicentre trial
comparing albumin with isotonic saline for fluid resusci￾tation in a mixed critical illness population [49]. Overall
no difference in outcome was found, but importantly
predefined subgroup analyses highlighted clinical po￾pulations worthy of further investigation. Patients with
brain injury appeared to have worse outcomes in the
albumin arm. It has been suggested that this was due to
the slight hypotonicity of the albumin preparation used
(260 mOsm.L−1
), which may have contributed to intra￾cranial hypertension [50]. Conversely, patients with sep￾sis seemed to have better outcomes with albumin. This
led to the recently published ALBIOS trial of albumin
supplementation in patients with sepsis, powered spe￾cifically to detect mortality difference in this more ho￾mogeneous group [51]. No differences in the primary
outcome were found, and despite differences in protocol
from the original SAFE study, this trial demonstrates the
utility of focussing on more tightly defined disease
phenotypes even in large randomised trials.
Lastly, the most basic example of matching fluid input
to the pathophysiological situation has been summarised
in the UK national guidance on intravenous fluid use
[52]. Here, clinicians are encouraged to consider exactly
why they are giving a fluid in a particular situation and
match the fluid composition and volume to one of the
following physiological needs:
 Resuscitation (bolus therapy recommended, using
fluids with sodium in the range 130–154 mmol.L−1
but avoiding starches)
 Routine maintenance (25–30 ml.kg−1
.day−1 with
1 mmol.kg−1
.day−1 each of sodium, potassium and
chloride, plus 50–100 g.day−1 of glucose)
 Replacement due to ongoing losses and
redistribution (fluid composition tailored to match
the estimated water and electrolyte loss)
Health-care setting: tailoring fluid strategy to the wider
clinical context
A further layer of complexity in fluid treatments may
come from the health-care setting in which they are
used. Fascinating insights have come from the FEAST
study, which took the principle of fluid bolus therapy
early in the presentation of patients with sepsis but
applied it in the setting of children presenting to hospital
in Africa [53]. In contrast to the potential benefits found
in previous studies, in this population there was a 3.3%
absolute increase in mortality at 48 h in the fluid inter￾vention group. Subsequent analysis has suggested that
these excess deaths were probably not attributable dir￾ectly to fluid overload (e.g. through respiratory or neuro￾logical events) [54]. Instead, the bolus fluid group had
an initial improvement in haemodynamic parameters,
but then went on to have an excess of cardiogenic or
shock-related terminal events. One interpretation of this
is that early large-volume fluid resuscitation sets up a
series of adverse processes, including vascular dysfunc￾tion and impaired myocardial performance. Thus, the
rapid reversal of shock may then lead to a requirement
for inotropic and other systems support, which are hard
to deliver in health-care systems without intensive care
facilities.
Conclusions
Abnormal fluid handling is a central part of many
critical illnesses, and exogenous fluid administration has
become a core part of medical care in these settings.
Despite apparently rational physiological goals, the rea￾lity of successful fluid intervention is extremely complex
at a basic biological, clinical and health-care system level.
As a result, many of the key research questions in this
field have not yet been definitively answered despite years
of research. Large trials and meta-analyses have raised the
possibility of fluid-related toxicities long after these fluids
have been brought to market. Intravenous fluids must be
re-framed as drugs, with indications, contraindications,

side effects and dose ranges. Lastly, the emergence of the
theme of individualisation—to timing, patient, disease
state and health-care setting—is an important step for￾ward, but a combination of robust basic science, transla￾tional trials and large clinical trials will be required to
progress this area further.
