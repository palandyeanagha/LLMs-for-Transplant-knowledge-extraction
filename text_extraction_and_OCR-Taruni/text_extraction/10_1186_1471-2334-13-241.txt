Abstract
Background: Mycobacterium abscessus is a rapidly growing mycobacterium responsible for progressive pulmonary
disease, soft tissue and wound infections. The incidence of disease due to M. abscessus has been increasing in
Queensland. In a study of Brisbane drinking water, M. abscessus was isolated from ten different locations.
The aim of this study was to compare genotypically the M. abscessus isolates obtained from water to those
obtained from human clinical specimens.
Methods: Between 2007 and 2009, eleven isolates confirmed as M. abscessus were recovered from potable water,
one strain was isolated from a rainwater tank and another from a swimming pool and two from domestic taps.
Seventy-four clinical isolates referred during the same time period were available for comparison using rep-PCR
strain typing (Diversilab).
Results: The drinking water isolates formed two clusters with ≥97% genetic similarity (Water patterns 1 and 2). The
tankwater isolate (WP4), one municipal water isolate (WP3) and the pool isolate (WP5) were distinctly different.
Patient isolates formed clusters with all of the water isolates except for WP3. Further patient isolates were unrelated
to the water isolates.
Conclusion: The high degree of similarity between strains of M. abscessus from potable water and strains causing
infection in humans from the same geographical area, strengthens the possibility that drinking water may be the
source of infection in these patients.
Background
Nontuberculous mycobacteria are environmental organ￾isms that can cause progressive lung disease in suscep￾tible patients. M. abscessus is a significant problem as it
is highly resistant to antimicrobial agents and usually
requires prolonged treatment (>six months) with intra￾venous and oral antibiotics in combination [1-3]. The in￾fection is often relentless despite treatment, and even if
treatment is apparently effective, relapse is common.
Rapidly growing mycobacteria such as M. abscessus are
also well documented causes of skin and soft tissue in￾fections, especially complicating surgical procedures and
injection sites [4].
Water is an important environmental reservoir of
mycobacteria causing human disease [5-7]. Humans are
exposed to waterborne mycobacteria through drinking,
swimming and bathing. Also aerosols generated during
these activities may be inhaled, [8] potentially resulting
in disease. There is a recognized association between
pulmonary infection with rapid growing mycobacteria
[9,10] (M. abscessus and M. fortuitum) and esophageal
disorders. It is possible that patients acquire infection by
aspirating contaminated water [11]. Outbreak investiga￾tions have identified M. abscessus in hospital water, dia￾lysis [12,13] and surgical equipment and endoscopy
cleaning equipment [14,15]. In many of these instances
it is not clear whether the source of these outbreaks was
an infected patient or water.
The taxonomy of Mycobacterium abscessus has been a
topic of debate in the literature. M. massiliense and M.
bolletii cannot be separated from M. abscessus on the
basis of extensive phenotypic analysis and genotypic
studies have lead to the proposition that the three taxa
represent a single species with internal variability [16].
Strain variation amongst species of mycobacteria is well
known and Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) has

been considered the “Gold standard” for strain typing
of many mycobacteria. ERIC (enterobacterial repetitive
intergenic consensus) PCR has been used successfully
to differentiate strains of mycobacteria associated with
outbreaks of disease in mesotherapy clinics due to M.
abscessus and M. chelonae, and in post mammoplasty
patients with M. fortuitum infections [17,18]. A high
concordance with PFGE was shown. More recently rep￾PCR (Diversilab) was used in comparison to PFGE in a
suspected outbreak of M. abscessus in a cystic fibrosis
clinic [19]. Isolates that were identical on PFGE shared
only 90% similarity with rep-PCR, suggesting that the
latter method may be more discriminatory. Rep-PCR
was similarly shown to concur with strain typing using
VNTR (variable number tandem repeats) [20]. This
method has significant advantages in cost and time sa￾ving over other methods and has demonstrated high
discriminatory power.
In Queensland NTM disease remains notifiable and a
central reference laboratory performs speciation of all
culture positive isolates, providing a unique opportunity
to capture isolates from around the state. The incidence
of disease due to NTM has been increasing [21] and be￾tween 2007–2008 water sampling was conducted to in￾vestigate the presence of pathogenic NTM in potable
water [22]. This paper reports the comparison of these
water isolates with human isolates collected from pa￾tients in South east Queensland during the same time
period.
Methods
Water isolates obtained in previous studies [22] had been
stored in Dubos broth at −20°C and were thawed and
subbed onto 7H11 plates as well as Lowenstein-Jensen
slopes and incubated at 35°C until sufficient growth was
available.
Those identified using 16S rDNA sequencing as M.
abscessus/M. chelonae underwent hsp65 and rpoB gene
fragment sequencing for more definitive identification.
According to the proposed changes by Leao et al. [16]
in line with the Bacteriological code, for the purposes
of this study all isolates identified as M. abscessus, M.
bolletii, M. massiliense were included as M. abscessus
species.
Human samples that were collected as part of routine
patient care, were digested and decontaminated using 4%
NaOH, neutralized with phosphoric acid and centrifuged
at 3000g to concentrate the acid-fast bacilli (AFB). Smears
were prepared from the sediment and stained by the
Ziehl-Niehlsen (ZN) method. One Lowenstein-Jensen
slope (±pyruvate) and 7ml Mycobacterial Growth Indica￾tor Tube (MGIT) were inoculated and incubated at 35°C
until growth was detected. ZN staining of colonies con￾firmed AFB. Multiplex PCR was performed to discriminate
between M. tuberculosis, M. avium, M. intracellulare, M.
abscessus and other Mycobacterium spp. Isolates identified
as other Mycobacterium spp were further speciated using
Hain Life Sciences GenoType® Mycobacterium CM kit
(2004–7 only) and/or 16S rDNA sequencing in conjunc￾tion with phenotypic characteristics. All clinical isolates
underwent gene fragment sequencing for hsp65 and rpoB.
Strain typing using automated Rep-PCR
The clonality of clinical and water M. abscessus isolates
and a control strain (ATCC 19977) was determined using
a rep-PCR based method (Diversilab® system, bioMerieux,
Melbourne). DNA was extracted from clinical and water
isolates using the Ultraclean Microbial DNA Isolation Kit
(Mo Bio Laboratories, CA, USA). PCR mixture was pre￾pared using AmpliTaq polymerase and PCR buffer (Ap￾plied Biosystems, New Jersey, USA) and Mycobacterium
Diversilab® primer mix according to the manufacturer’s in￾structions. Separation and detection of Rep-PCR products
was performed by micro-fluidic chips of the Diversilab®
System. A laboratory control strain of M. abscessus was
included, and two chips were repeated because of low in￾tensity banding. In most cases when the intensity im￾proved the pattern didn’t change from that obtained with
low intensity. An additional chip was run twice to confirm
reproducibility of strain patterns. Any aberrances were ex￾cluded from the analysis. Fingerprints were analysed with
Diversilab® software v.3.4.38 using the Pearson correlation
co-efficient and unweighted pair group method with arith￾metic means to compare isolates and determine clonal re￾lationship. A similarity index of ≥97% was used to define
isolates that were indistinguishable, based on the manu￾facturers recommendations despite previously published
comparisons of rep-PCR with both PFGE and Variable
Number Tandem Repeats, [20] where a cut off of 90% was
used. Isolates that shared 95% similarity were considered
similar (and formed groups), and those <90% considered
‘different/unrelated’.
The study protocol was approved by the Human Re￾search Ethics Committee of The Prince Charles Hospital
(EC-2617).
Results
During the 10 years from 2001–2010, there were 486 pa￾tient notifications: 68.1% were pulmonary, 22.2% cutane￾ous or soft tissue (Table 1).
Seventy-four clinical isolates collected during 2007–8
were available for comparison with fifteen water isolates.
The mean age of patients was 55.94 yrs (SD 22.25; me￾dian 58.5; range 2-90yrs). Fifty percent were male. Forty￾four patients had clinically significant pulmonary disease
(according to clinician notification and the ATS/IDSA
criteria), 11 patients had pulmonary isolates that were

considered contaminants or not clinically significant and
19 patients had isolates from extra-pulmonary sites.
Eleven patients (14.9%) were included from other parts
of Australia who lived >500 km outside the Brisbane
water distribution network, and would have received
potable water supply to their homes from different net￾works. Of the remaining patients, 31/63 (49.2%) patients
lived in reservoir zones that contained sample points
that grew M. abscessus.
Of 19 water isolates identified as M. abscessus/
M. chelonae using 16s rDNA sequencing, 17 underwent
successful hsp65 and rpoB sequencing. This identified
14 isolates as M. abscessus and one as M. bolletii – all
considered M. abscessus subs abscessus according to
the proposed taxonomy by Leao [16]. There was insuffi￾cient DNA in two samples. Fifteen water isolates of
M. abscessus were strain typed using rep-PCR. Eleven
isolates came from six different potable water distribu￾tion system sampling sites; two came from domestic
taps in the same dwelling, one came from an unrelated
rainwater tank and the other from a suburban domestic
swimming pool.
The 15 water isolates formed 6 different patterns
(Figure 1). Municipal water isolates formed two clus￾ters of indistinguishable isolates (≥97% similarity) and
were classified as Group WP1 (eight isolates) and Group
WP2 (two isolates) and a single isolate WP3. The rain￾water tank isolate (Group WP4) and the swimming pool
isolate (Group WP5) were distinctly different. The two
isolates from a patient’s domestic taps were indistin￾guishable (WP 6) (Figure 1).
When the clinical isolates were analysed with the
water isolates there were 28 patterns/clusters that shared
>97% similarity (indistinguishable). Thirteen of these clus￾ters contained more than 1 isolate, and the remaining
patterns were single isolates only. The indistinguishable

clusters that were similar (>95% similarity) were then
grouped into seven main groups. Full report and graphics
in Additional file 1.
There were two large similar clusters of 21 (P15) and
22 (P17) isolates respectively. Examples demonstrated
in Figure 2. P15 included one of the municipal water
isolates from WP1 and P17 contained the remaining
seven isolates from WP1. A further three clusters (P12-
14) containing 5 clinical isolates were similar to cluster
P15 and a single isolate P16 was similar to P17.
The two water isolates from WP2 also clustered with
six clinical isolates (P20-22;Gp 4: Additional file 1). Five
clinical isolates were indistinguishable from the tank
water isolate (P2). A further three clinical isolates and
the two domestic tap water isolates were similar to this
cluster (Group 1). One clinical isolate was indistinguish￾able from the swimming pool isolate Figure 3.
The isolate from water site 320 (WP3) differed from
all the clinical isolates.
There were no significant differences between the
characteristics of groups of patients in each strain cluster
(age, gender, type of disease, site of infection, ground
water source or reservoir zone) (Table 2). Some of the
isolates from more remote areas did have unique strain
patterns, but equally so did some of the Brisbane area
isolates. Some of the remote area isolates were similar to
those of patients from Brisbane. However as is often the
case with NTM infections, the precise location of where
infection is acquired can be difficult to pinpoint.
Discussion
M. abscessus has become an increasingly important cli￾nical problem in the last 10 years, and its presence in
potable water has not previously been emphasized.

In the majority of published studies looking for NTM
in water, no M. abscessus was documented [23]. How￾ever there have been taxonomical changes that have led
to M. abscessus being recognized as independent from
M. chelonae, so older studies reporting M. chelonae may
not necessarily have differentiated M. chelonae subsp
abscessus, particularly as both species have identical 16s
rDNA sequences. But in studies of potable water done
since 2000 M. abscessus has been rarely reported.
A study done in Pretoria, South Africa in 2004 [24]
reported an analysis of 78 biofilm and water samples – 14
had NTM – no MAC, one had M. abscessus (16s rDNA
sequencing only). In a multi-hospital outbreak investigation
in Taiwan, M. abscessus was grown from one water sample
from one of the hospitals involved however this differed
on strain typing from the isolates found in patients [25].
Falkinham [26] in 2001 sampled 8 different water treat￾ment systems (raw, treated and Distribution System (DS)
samples). M. abscessus was only found in one raw water
sample from one system. There were no rapid growers in
treated water, two rapid growers were found in the DS
samples but the paper doesn’t clarify the species. In a more
recent study (2009), van Ingen reported no M. abscessus in
shower or tap water in the Netherlands [27]. We have
found that the inclusion of liquid media increased the yield
for M. abscessus from potable water samples [22]. However

three of the 13 isolates were only grown on solid media –
suggesting that for future studies using culture-based
techniques, both media forms should be included.
It has long been recognized that outbreaks of disease
due to rapid growers may have originated in hospital and
tap water, particularly for M. chelonae and M. fortuitum
[28] though in some studies the authors have acknowl￾edged that speciation separating M. abscessus has not oc￾curred. Outbreak investigations have linked M. abscessus
infections and pseudo infections to hospital tap water, and
endoscope cleaning fluids [29,30].
In all of these hospital outbreaks, the potential for con￾tamination of hospital sources and equipment by infected
patients or other environmental sources (such as dust or
dirt) exists; hence the origin of the culprit strain remains
unclear.
Zelazny [31] compared partial sequencing of rpoB,
hsp65 and secA gene fragments and rep-PCR (Diversilab)
in order to differentiate M. abscessus from subspecies
formerly named M. massiliense and M. bolletii. They
were able to group the majority of M. abscessus complex
clinical isolates into a group similar to the ATCC strain
19977, with a degree of diversity as low as 80% similarity
to the reference strain. There were two other strain
groups neither of which resembled the strain patterns
obtained in our study. The geographic origin of the
patients included in this study was not reported nor
examined, but as the study was performed by a tertiary
referral centre many came from patients around the
United States (A. Zelazny, personal communication). In
our study the strains obtained both from patients and
from water were closely related, and differed from the
strain patterns reported in the US, suggesting geogra￾phical differences in strain variation. The diversity of the
US strains, may be due to the diverse origins of the
isolates reported, reflecting differences in the dominant
environmental strains. There was a degree of geographic
diversity of our strains with unique strain types iden￾tified from central and far north Queensland (>500km
and > 1000km from Brisbane respectively) and two unique
strains from the bayside of Brisbane (> 30km from the
CBD).
Whilst rep-PCR using the Diversilab has only recently
been used for strain typing mycobacteria, published studies
support its performance as equivalent or perhaps even
more discriminatory than PFGE. Aitken et al [19] reported
an outbreak of M. abscessus infections in a lung transplant￾ation and cystic fibrosis center. Isolates involved were
strain typed using both PFGE and rep-PCR (Diversilab).
The isolate of the index case and outbreak cases were
reported to be “genetically identical” using PFGE. The rep￾PCR patterns of the same isolates showed only 90% genetic
similarity, suggesting in fact that these strains are different,
and that rep-PCR may be more discriminatory than PFGE.
Harris [20] describes a novel VNTR (variable number
tandem repeats) method to type 41 M. abscessus com￾plex strains from 17 pediatric cystic fibrosis patients and
compares this with rep-PCR (Diversilab). As with the
Aitken paper, isolates with 90% similarity were regarded
as indistinguishable. The finding of six distinct profiles
among 12 patients with M. abscessus complex suggests
that the typing methods have sufficient discriminatory
power.
Conclusion
We have analysed both patient and water isolates from
quite diverse and epidemiologically unrelated settings
across a geographical area of >1367km2 and found 28
clusters. We have more definitively identified M. abscessus
strains in potable water, as strains that are indistinguish￾able from those found in samples from patients known to
have disease. Whilst point source investigations of out￾breaks have linked M. abscessus infection and hospital
water and equipment, the present study tightens the link
between potable water, to which patients are regularly ex￾posed, and the acquisition of infection. This has important
implications for those patients at risk. Given the difficulty
in treating these infections and the devastating effects they
have for patients, efforts to identify effective disinfection
methods for M. abscessus should be a high priority.
