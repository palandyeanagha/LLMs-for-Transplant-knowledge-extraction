Abstract
Background: Lung transplantation (LTx) is still limited by the shortage of suitable donor lungs. Developing flexible
surgical procedures can help to increase the chances of LTx by unfolding recipient-to-donor matching options
based on the pre-existing organ allocation concept. We report a case in which a successful left-to-right inverted LTx
was completed using the interposition of a pericardial conduit for pulmonary venous anastomosis.
Case presentation: A left lung graft was offered to a 59-year-old male who had idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis with
predominant damage in the right lung. He had been prescribed bed rest with constant oxygen inhalation through
an oxymizer pendant and had been on the waiting list for 20 months. Considering the condition of the patient
(LAS 34.3) and the scarcity of domestic organ offers, the patient was highly likely to be incapable of tolerating any
additional waiting time for another donor organ if he was unable to accept the presently reported offer of a left
lung. Eventually, we decided to transplant the left donor lung into the right thorax of the recipient. Because of the
anterior-posterior position gap of the hilar structures, the cuff lengths of the pulmonary veins had to be adjusted.
The patient did not develop any anastomotic complications after the transplantation.
Conclusions: A left-to-right inverted LTx is technically feasible using an autologous pericardial conduit for
pulmonary venous anastomosis in selected cases. This technique provides the potential benefit of resolving
challenging situations in which surgeons must deal with a patient’s urgency and the logistical limitations of organ
allocation.

Background
The development of flexible surgical procedures has
increased the chances of lung transplantation (LTx) by
unfolding recipient-to-donor matching options based on
the pre-existing organ allocation concept; surgery to lib￾erate the grafting side is one such example. In particular,
a single inverted left-to-right LTx may be considered
under the following conditions: 1) despite a right-side￾predominant lung dysfunction in the recipient candidate,
the available donor organ options are limited to the use
of a left single donor lung, based on evidence of right
donor lung injury or the need for the donor lung to be
shared with another candidate with waitlist priority; or
2) a left side transplantation in the recipient is impos￾sible because of a past history of thoracic surgery [1].
The need to adjust the positional relationships because
of the take-off angle mismatch of the hilar structures is
one of the key challenges in inverted transplantation.
Herein, we report a case of successful inverted left-to￾right LTx with pulmonary venous anastomosis using peri￾cardial conduit interposition for the venous anastomosis.

Case presentation
A 59-year-old male patient with idiopathic interstitial
fibrosis who had been receiving long-term oxygen ther￾apy was considered for a single LTx. A chest computed
tomography (CT) examination and ventilation-perfusion
scintigraphy (ventilation: right/left = 55%/45%; perfusion:
right/left = 35%/65%) revealed heterogeneous disease
progression, with predominant damage in the right lung
(Fig. 1). The results of an arterial blood gas test and a 6-
min walk test were a pO2 of 106.5 mmHg, a pCO2 of
55 mmHg, and 156 m, respectively, under 7 L/min of
oxygen inhalation using an oxymizer pendant. The pa￾tient’s activity level was restricted to moving from bed to
a wheelchair while he continued to receive rehabilitation,
and he had been on the waitlist for 20 months.
A 50-year-old female donor died of hypoxic brain
damage. A plain chest x-ray revealed no marked infiltra￾tion in either lung field. An arterial blood gas analysis
revealed a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 510, although inspection
after lung flushing during the procurement surgery re￾vealed broad edematous changes and a poor compliance
of the left lower lobe (Fig. 2a). A right-sided LTx, rather
than a left-sided LTx, was the favorable option, consid￾ering the heterogeneity of our patient’s lung injury.
However, he had to share the offered lungs with another
candidate who was prioritized on the waitlist and also
needed a right LTx. Because of the seriousness of his
condition and the scarcity of organ donors in Japan [2],
we considered that the patient might not be capable of
tolerating any additional waiting time if the presently re￾ported offer of the left lung could not be accepted. The
recipient’s CT images and lung perfusion function tests
showed that the deterioration in the right lung was more
significant than that in the left lung; in addition, the
graft was not a perfect lung but a marginal lung. There￾fore, we chose to leave the left lung with better function
and to transplant the graft into the right thoracic cavity
so as to maximize the achievable total lung function. As
for the pulmonary edema in the left lower lobe of the
donor lung, we anticipated early re-conditioning because
of the reversed positioning in the recipient thorax. Tak￾ing all aspects into consideration, we eventually decided
to transplant the offered left donor lung into the right
thorax of the recipient.
The operation was performed under cardiopulmonary
bypass (CPB) through a right semi-clamshell incision.
The circulatory dynamics were unstable during the left
PA clamp test. CPB was used to obtain cardiac drainage,
and a surgical field in which the central hilar region was
easily accessible was created. The interatrial groove was
dissected as much as possible to facilitate the clamping
of the pulmonary veins as proximally as possible. The re￾cipient pulmonary artery was transected at the distal
level of the first branch. A maximal length of the donor
pulmonary artery and atrial cuff were secured. The
donor left lung was placed in the recipient right thorax
with a 180° rotation around its superior-inferior axis
from its anatomic position (Fig. 3a). The anastomoses
were performed from the dorsal side in the order of the
pulmonary vein, bronchus, and pulmonary artery. Be￾cause of the anterior-posterior position gap between the
donor and recipient pulmonary veins, a venous cuff
extension was necessary so as to secure a cuff length
sufficient for anastomosis. The veins were separately
anastomosed using autologous pericardial conduits on
the anterior and posterior sides. The anterior wall and
posterior wall were built with the pedicle pericardium
and free pericardium from the donor, respectively, using
a running 6–0 polypropylene suture. End-to-end bron￾chial anastomosis was performed, with membranous-to￾cartilaginous apposition. The donor pulmonary artery
was located superiorly and anteriorly, while the recipi￾ent’s was located inferiorly and posteriorly. To resolve
this problem, it was necessary to dissect the recipient
pulmonary artery diagonally and to translocate it to an
anterior position. However, no conduit was required for
the pulmonary artery anastomosis, since both the recipi￾ent and the donor cuffs were sufficiently long. After
completing the anastomosis (Fig. 3b), reperfusion was
successfully achieved without complications. Neither
kinking of the pulmonary vessels nor congestion of the
transplanted lung were observed. The CPB time, opera￾tive time and ischemic time were 231 min, 421 min and
514 min, respectively. The blood loss was 1730 mL; 0 mL

computed tomographic images revealed heterogeneous disease progression, with predominant damage in the right lung

of red blood cells, 1440 mL of frozen fresh plasma, and
400 mL of platelet concentrates were administered dur￾ing the operation. No postoperative anticoagulation was
required.
The patient developed grade 3 primary graft dysfunction
but recovered quickly. A chest CT examination on postop￾erative day 7 revealed prompt amelioration of the edema￾tous changes in the donor lower lobe in the reverse position
and adaptation of the left donor lung in the recipient right
chest cavity without the development of atelectasis (Fig. 2b).
The patient was hemodynamically stable and was weaned
from the mechanical ventilator 4 days after the surgery. He
was diagnosed as having antibody-mediated rejection
(AMR) at 89 and 158 days after LTx, necessitating several
courses of intensive immunosuppressive treatment and
prolonging the period of hospitalization, but the patient was
eventually discharged from the hospital 6 months after the
LTx. Unfortunately, the repeated AMR episodes resulted in
reluctant Aspergillus pneumonia, and the patient died 260
days after surgery. However, no radiological or physiological
evidence of anastomosis problems was seen throughout the
postoperative course.
Discussion and conclusions
In the present case, we used an organ with limited avail￾ability successfully and effectively by explanting the
recipient’s less-functional right lung and transplanting a
donor lung from the opposite side (left lung). The pos￾ition gap of the hilar structures was overcome using a
pericardial conduit for pulmonary venous anastomosis.
No anastomotic complications were encountered, and
the morphological discrepancy between the inverted left
lung graft and the recipient’s right chest cavity posed no
problems post-transplantation.
In inverted lung transplantation [1], the graft bronchus
is located anteriorly and the graft pulmonary artery and
vein are located posteriorly to the recipient’s hilar struc￾tures. The rigidity of the bronchus usually determines

the donor and recipient pulmonary veins, a venous cuff extension using autologous pericardial conduits was necessary. However, no conduit was
required for the pulmonary artery anastomosis, as both the recipient and donor cuffs were sufficiently long. Bronchial anastomosis was
performed with membranous-to-cartilaginous apposition

the positional relationship between the hilar structures
of the graft and recipient. Thus, the cuff lengths of the
remaining pulmonary artery and veins must be adjusted.
A long pulmonary arterial cuff is easily secured by leav￾ing the recipient’s main pulmonary artery as distally as
possible. However, the same is not the case for the pul￾monary venous cuff in a single LTx in which the heart
and opposite lung are also utilized for another patient.
We resolved the issue by interposing a conduit con￾structed with the donor’s pericardium. The conduit attach￾ment procedure was performed on a back table, where it
was easy to handle the graft and to manage the procedure.
Autologous pericardial conduit interpositioning has been
reported as an effective technique for cuff extension in both
cadaveric and living donor lobar lung transplantation [3–5].
This technique has several potential limitations. There
is some risk of kinking of the vascular anastomosis, of
complications related to the bronchial membranous-to￾cartilaginous anastomosis, and of atelectasis due to an
imperfect fit of the donor lung in the recipient’s chest
cavity.
On the other hand, as a potential secondary benefit,
the edematous portion of the lower lobe of the grafted
lung was inverted to the anterior side, enabling recondi￾tioning from the edema to be obtained at relatively early
during the postoperative period.
In conclusion, a left-to-right inverted transplantation
is technically feasible in selected cases using an autolo￾gous pericardial conduit for pulmonary venous anasto￾mosis. This technique provides the potential benefit of
resolving challenging situations in which surgeons must
to deal with a patient’s urgency and the logistical limita￾tions of organ allocation.
