Abstract
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether women with congenital heart
disease were receiving appropriate advice on contraception.
SETTING: Adult congenital heart disease clinic in a tertiary cardiac


referral centre. DESIGN: Questionnaire administered to 35
consecutive female patients attending the adult congenital clinic.
The cardiologist assessed what the risk would be if each patient
used an oestrogen containing contraceptive pill (OCP). RESULTS: Of
the 33 patients admitted to the study 6 patients thought their heart
condition precluded them from taking an OCP when in fact it did
not and 3 incorrectly said that an OCP would be suitable for them.
Three women with relatively minor lesions had been incorrectly
denied the OCP and 2 further patients were using inappropriate
methods. There had been 6 unwanted pregnancies in the total
group. CONCLUSIONS: Many women with congenital heart disease
do not know the most appropriate method of contraception for
them or have received incorrect advice. It is often patients with less
severe lesions who receive the most inappropriate advice. It is clear
that the family planning needs of this population are currently
poorly catered for. Each unit must ensure that the information
necessary in making informed decisions on contraception is
available to the doctor advising on family planning.
