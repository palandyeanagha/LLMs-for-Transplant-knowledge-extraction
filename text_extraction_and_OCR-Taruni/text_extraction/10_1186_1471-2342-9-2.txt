Abstract
Background: Knowledge about age-specific normal values for left ventricular mass (LVM), end￾diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV), stroke volume (SV) and ejection fraction (EF)
by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) is of importance to differentiate between health and
disease and to assess the severity of disease. The aims of the study were to determine age and
gender specific normal reference values and to explore the normal physiological variation of these
parameters from adolescence to late adulthood, in a cross sectional study.
Methods: Gradient echo CMR was performed at 1.5 T in 96 healthy volunteers (11–81 years, 50
male). Gender-specific analysis of parameters was undertaken in both absolute values and adjusted
for body surface area (BSA).
Results: Age and gender specific normal ranges for LV volumes, mass and function are presented
from the second through the eighth decade of life. LVM, ESV and EDV rose during adolescence and
declined in adulthood. SV and EF decreased with age. Compared to adult females, adult males had
higher BSA-adjusted values of EDV (p = 0.006) and ESV (p < 0.001), similar SV (p = 0.51) and lower
EF (p = 0.014). No gender differences were seen in the youngest, 11–15 year, age range.
Conclusion: LV volumes, mass and function vary over a broad age range in healthy individuals. LV
volumes and mass both rise in adolescence and decline with age. EF showed a rapid decline in
adolescence compared to changes throughout adulthood. These findings demonstrate the need for
age and gender specific normal ranges for clinical use.
Background
Fundamental structural and functional properties of the
left ventricle including left ventricular mass (LVM), vol￾umes, and function are often assessed in the clinical set￾ting using two dimensional echocardiography. The
clinical use of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR)

has increased lately and a consensus panel report has
established clinical indications for cardiovascular mag￾netic resonance [1].
It is of great clinical importance to be able to differentiate
between normal and abnormal findings, but this may
often prove difficult if adequate normal values are
unknown. The need for age and gender specific normal
values with CMR is therefore growing. Several studies
have defined CMR normal ranges of LV volumes and func￾tion in limited age ranges [2-8], and none of these have
examined these parameters over a wide age range in
healthy individuals. A recent study presented age and gen￾der specific normal ranges for CMR at 1.5 T using a steady
state free precession sequence [9]. However, at times,
some centers still need to use gradient echo sequences in
clinical assessment at 1.5 T.
The aim of the study was, therefore, to suggest clinically
usable age and gender specific normal ranges for LV vol￾umes and function using gradient echo CMR at 1.5 T for
the second through the eighth decade of life. We also
sought to explore, in a cross sectional study, the normal
variation of LV volumes and function in strictly healthy
subjects over a wide age range in order to examine the age
variation of these parameters.
Methods
Study population and design
The study population consisted of 96 healthy volunteers
prospectively recruited by advertisement from the local
community (76 adults, age 21–81 and 20 children, age
11–15, all caucasian). No subjects were excluded because
of poor image quality. All subjects had a normal electro￾cardiogram (ECG) and blood pressure (systolic blood
pressure (SBP) ≤ 140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure
(DBP) ≤ 90 mmHg) [10] and had no history of systolic or
diastolic hypertension. Subjects with previous or current
cardiovascular, systemic, metabolic disease, body mass
index ≥ 30, visually overt aortic or mitral valve regurgita￾tion in long axis MR images, or treatment with medication
(except oral contraceptives [n=5], hormone replacement
therapy [n=5] or oral incontinence medication [n=1])
were excluded from the study. MR imaging was performed
within four weeks after inclusion with image analysis
undertaken by independent observers blinded to subject
characteristics. The investigation protocol and procedures
were approved by the Lund University research ethics
committee (reference number LU 207-00). Written
informed consent was obtained from all subjects prior to
inclusion.
Blood pressure
SBP and DBP were obtained in the supine or seated posi￾tion by auscultation using a brachial cuff.
MR imaging
All patients were imaged in the supine position using a 1.5
T system (Magnetom Vision; Siemens, Erlangen, Ger￾many) with a 25 mT/m gradient system and a phased￾array body coil. Standard scout images were used to locate
the orthogonal planes of the heart. End-expiratory ECG
triggered short-axis gradient echo cine loops were then
acquired throughout the left ventricle from the base (atri￾oventricular valve plane) to the apex. Typical imaging
parameters were TR = 100 ms, and echo sharing gave an
effective phase interval of 50 ms, TE = 4.8 ms, slice thick￾ness 10 mm, field of view 350–420 mm, matrix 126 ×
256, flip angle 20°. The number of cardiac phases per
acquisition was determined as the integer obtained from
the RR interval divided by TR. Nine to twelve slices were
required to completely cover the left ventricle, depending
on heart size.
MR image analysis
i) Tracing of endocardial and epicardial contours
All measurements were undertaken manually without the
aid of automated image analysis software. End-diastolic
and end-systolic frames were identified according to ven￾tricular blood pool area. Measurements of the left ven￾tricular endocardial and epicardial areas (Scion Image
Beta 4.0.2, Scion Imaging Corporation) in each image
frame were performed in the short-axis view. At the base
of the left ventricle, the aortic outflow tract below the
valve was included in volume measurements. The free
papillary muscles were included for LVM assessment, and
excluded for left ventricular volume assessment [11]. In
the basal region of the heart where the left atrium was
seen, only the portion of the slice that could be identified
as left ventricle was included for measurement (Figure 1).
ii) Left ventricular mass and dimensions
The difference in area between the endocardial and epicar￾dial contours multiplied by the slice thickness (10 mm)
represented myocardial volume for a given slice. Total
myocardial mass was obtained by calculating the sum of
all myocardial slice volumes and multiplying by the myo￾cardial specific gravity (1.05 g/cm3). End-diastolic volume
(EDV) and end-systolic volume (ESV) were calculated as
the endocardial volume at end-diastole and end-systole
respectively. Stroke volume (SV) was calculated as the dif￾ference between EDV and ESV. Ejection fraction (EF) was
calculated as SV divided by EDV. All parameters were
divided by body surface area (BSA) to achieve values
adjusted for body size (e.g. LVM/BSA for left ventricular
mass adjusted for BSA). In addition, a subset of 20 sub￾jects were analyzed by 2 readers blinded to each others
results in order to examine interobserver variability.
Intraobserver variability was assessed by one observer
who performed repeated blinded measurements in the
same 20 subjects one month later.

Statistical analysis
SPSS (version 16) was used for statistical calculations. A p
value less than 0.05 was considered statistically signifi￾cant. Values are expressed as mean ± SD. Unpaired Stu￾dent's t test or ANOVA were used to test for significance
between groups since both visual inspection and the Kol￾mogorov-Smirnov test showed that all measures were ade￾quately normally distributed. Intra- and interobserver
variability were assessed as the mean difference of meas￾urements ± SD and by the intraclass correlation coeffe￾cient (ICC) employing a two-way mixed model [12]. The
coefficient of variation (CV) was calculated as the SD of
the difference between two measurements expressed as
percent of their mean. The coeffiecient of repeatability
(CR) was calculated as two times the SD of the difference
in two measurements. Pearson's correlation coefficient
was used to assess the correlation between two variables,
and expressed as its square (R2). BSA was calculated using
a previously described technique [13]. Curve estimation
and the 95% prediction intervals of LVM, dimensions,
and function were defined using commercial software
(Matlab curve fitting toolbox, Matlab version R12, Math￾works). The most appropriate curve fitting algorithm for
LVM, dimensions and functional measures was identified
as the rational polynomial of the form P(x)/Q(x) where
both numerator and denominator were at most of the sec￾ond degree and which had the highest adjusted R2 and
lowest root mean square (RMS) of the error [14]. The pre￾dicted lower, mean and upper limits for normal values of
LV parameters in each decade were calculated as the aver￾age of the mean and 95% prediction interval of the pre￾dicted values for each whole year as given by the curve
estimation model.
Results
Population description
Data from 94 of the 96 subjects have, in part, previously
been published in a study of LVM and wall stress [14].
Table 1 displays the baseline characteristics for the current
study population. Blood pressure was similar between
genders and well within accepted normal limits [10].
Normal variation of left ventricular measures with age
Table 2 lists suggested age-specific reference values for LV
mass, EDV, ESV, SV and EF as absolute values and
adjusted for BSA for males and females, respectively.
i) Left ventricular mass
Information on the age dependence of LV mass and wall
stress in the majority of this population have been pub￾lished and discussed previously [14]. The current study,
however, provides tabular values in order to ease the use
of this information as reference values. Figure 2 and Figure
3 describe the changes in left ventricular mass with age.
ii) End-diastolic and End-systolic volume
Ventricular volumes varied markedly between males and
females (Figure 2 and Figure 3). Notably, there was a rise
in EDV and ESV during adolescence and early adulthood
in males, with a decline thereafter, possibly reflecting the
concurrent change of LVM with age. This was absent in
females with a trend towards a decrease of EDV and EDV/

BSA with age and increase of ESV and ESV/BSA with age.
Ventricular volumes in the adolescent group were similar
between males and females (EDV: 120 ± 29 ml vs. 114 ±
23 ml, p = 0.66; EDV/BSA: 76 ± 11 ml/m2 vs. 77 ± 11 ml/
m2, p = 0.95; ESV: 35 ± 8 ml vs. 32 ± 11 ml, p = 0.48; ESV/
BSA: 22 ± 4 ml/m2 vs. 21 ± 7 ml/m2, p = 0.65). However,
differences between genders became apparent for all ven￾tricular volumes in the adult group with higher values in
the male group (EDV: 153 ± 30 ml vs. 118 ± 19 ml, p <
0.001; EDV/BSA: 76 ± 13 ml/m2 vs. 69 ± 9 ml/m2, p =
0.006; ESV: 63 ± 17 ml vs. 43 ± 11 ml, p < 0.001; ESV/BSA:
31 ± 8 ml/m2 vs. 25 ± 6 ml/m2, p < 0.001).
iii) Left ventricular stroke volume and ejection fraction
In general, both SV and EF demonstrated a decline with
age (Figure 3). Although differences in SV and EF between
males and females were present in the adult group (SV: 91
± 19 ml vs. 75 ± 15 ml, p < 0.001; SV/BSA: 45 ± 9 ml/m2
vs. 44 ± 9 ml/m2, p = 0.51; EF: 0.59 ± 0.07 vs. 0.64 ± 0.08,
p = 0.014), SV and EF were similar between genders in the
adolescent group (SV: 85 ± 22 ml vs. 83 ± 16 ml, p = 0.82;
SV/BSA: 54 ± 9 ml/m2 vs. 55 ± 7 ml/m2, p = 0.70; EF: 0.71
± 0.04 vs. 0.73 ± 0.06, p = 0.36). Notably, left ventricular
EF in the adolescent group was higher (Figure 3) com￾pared to adult subjects (0.72 ± 0.05 vs. 0.61 ± 0.07, p <
0.001) with a decline in both males and females from
~70% to ~60% with age.
Normal ranges for left ventricular mass, volumes and 
function
All variables varied according to age group (ANOVA, p <
0.05) except for EDV/BSA (p = 0.13) and ESV/BSA (p =
0.06) in males, and EDV (p = 0.39), EDV/BSA (p = 0.15),
ESV/BSA (p = 0.28), SV (p = 0.14) and LVM/BSA (p =
0.24) in females.
Intra- and interobserver variability
Data on intra- and interobserver variability are presented
in Table 3.
Discussion
This study suggests age and gender specific normal values
for LV mass, volumes and function measured in a healthy
population over a large age range using gradient echo
CMR at 1.5 T.
One of the most important tasks in patient examination is
to distinguish normal findings from those indicative of
disease. Normal ranges for a given parameter encompass￾ing 95% of the population constitute the mainstay of this
procedure. With increasing use of cardiac magnetic reso￾nance imaging, the need for age-specific ranges of LV
mass, volumes and function for this modality is obvious.
This is of specific importance in order to correctly exclude
disease.

A) Left ventricular mass
The findings regarding left ventricular mass in the present
study and its relation to earlier studies has been discussed
earlier [14]. Other non-invasive techniques including
three dimensional echocardiography [15,16] and compu￾terized tomography [17] have overcome many of the
shortcomings of two dimensional echocardiography
although no reference values for normal patients have
been established in a large population.
B) Left ventricular volumes, stroke volume and ejection 
fractions
Six CMR studies [3-5,7-9] have described overall values of
EDV, ESV, SV, and EF, which are consistent with findings
from other imaging modalities and are, in the correspond￾ing age ranges, broadly consistent with the findings in this
study, with one exception. Sandstede et al used a gradient
echo sequence and reported as much as 20–30% lower
values for LV mass and volumes. Those authors chose to
only measure LV volumes and mass in short axis slices
which contained more than 50% of the circumference of
the LV wall in both end-diastole and end-systole. This
approach does not take into account the long axis move￾ment of the basal parts of the left ventricle [11], which in
part may explain the lower values obtained in that study.
Hudsmith et al, showed differences between subjects
above and below the age of 35 [8], but continuous age￾specific values of these parameters, however, have not
been described using gradient echo CMR in populations
that extend over the breadth of age as in the present study.
We show that adult females had a slight progressive
decrease in ESV with age, with a resulting slight progres￾sive increase in EF, whereas Maceira et al [9], showed the
opposite. BMI and blood pressure were similar for both
populations, hence it is likely some other factor which
contributes to the difference between the studies. The dis￾crepancy is difficult to interpret, and one can only specu￾late as to what difference between the populations may
explain this discrepancy.
The inotropy of the left ventricle has been shown to be
related to growth hormone/IGF levels [18]. Although our

study has not measured growth hormone levels, one
might speculate that the higher EDV, SV and EF in
younger subjects may possibly, in part, reflect the higher
growth hormone levels within this age group. Alterna￾tively, these higher values may be due to physical activity
rather than hormones. However, we have previously pub￾lished that self-reported physical activity increased with
age in our population [14]. Thus, it is unclear exactly why
these measures are larger in younger subjects.
Reproducibility of measurement
The reproducibility of CMR LV measures obtained in our
study was consistent with previously reported studies of
intra- and interobserver variability [19-21].
Limitations
Regurgitation in the aortic or mitral valve was only
assessed visually in long axis CMR images, and this is a
limitation. However, it is likely that this was sufficient to
serve the purposes of this study in this population with
otherwise unremarkable ECG, medical history and physi￾cal examination. The number of included subjects in each
gender and decade is less than the minimally suggested n
= 10 [21] for the size of a group needed to determine ref￾erence values. However, the suggestion of n = 10 is based
on the use of the mean +/- 2SD of those subjects' measure￾ments as a basis for calculating reference values. In con￾trast, we used a curve estimation model and its 95%
prediction interval to determine our reference values.
Using this method, the robustness of the reference values
is based on data from the entire population and less sus￾ceptible to small numbers of subjects in individual decade
groups. The normal values provided in this study are
appropriate for studies undertaken using similar gradient
echo sequences at 1.5 T. It has been shown that steady￾state free precession based sequences may result in slightly
lower LVM and greater LV volumes [7,22,23]. These differ￾ences are likely to be systematic in nature and do not alter
the physiological significance of the age trends reported in
the current study. Furthermore, the use of steady-state free
precession based sequences at a field strength of 3 T is cur￾rently hampered by artifacts [24]. The presented normal
values for gradient echo sequences at 1.5 T may thereby
also be of value for assessing results from gradient echo
cardiac imaging at 3 T.
Conclusion
This study suggests normal reference values for left ven￾tricular mass, dimensions, and function in healthy
humans from early adolescence to the eighth decade
according to gender using gradient echo CMR at 1.5 T. LV
volumes, mass and function vary over a broad age range
in healthy individuals. LV volumes and mass both rise in
adolescence and decline with age. EF showed a rapid
decline in adolescence compared to changes throughout
adulthood. These findings further demonstrate the need
for age and gender specific normal ranges for clinical car￾diac MR examinations.
