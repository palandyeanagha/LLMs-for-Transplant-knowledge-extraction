Aims: The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of radiofrequency thermal ablation (RFTA),
percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI), and percutaneous acetic acid injection (PAI) in the treatment of
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Patients and methods: A total of 187 patients with HCCs of 3 cm or less were randomly assigned to RFTA
(n = 62), PEI (n = 62), or PAI (n = 63). Tumour recurrence and survival rates were assessed.
Results: One, two, and three year local recurrence rates were 10%, 14%, and 14% in the RFTA group,
16%, 34%, and 34% in the PEI group, and 14%, 31%, and 31% in the PAI group (RFTA v PEI, p = 0.012;
RFTA v PAI, p = 0.017). One, two, and three year survival rates were 93%, 81%, and 74% in the RFTA
group, 88%, 66%, and 51% in the PEI group, and 90%, 67%, and 53% in the PAI group (RFTA v PEI,
p = 0.031; RFTA v PAI, p = 0.038). One, two, and three year cancer free survival rates were 74%, 60%,
and 43% in the RFTA group, 70%, 41%, and 21% in the PEI group, and 71%, 43%, and 23% in the PAI
group (RFTA v PEI, p = 0.038; RFTA v PAI, p = 0.041). Tumour size, tumour differentiation, and treatment
methods (RFTA v PEI and PAI) were significant factors for local recurrence, overall survival, and cancer free
survival. Major complications occurred in 4.8% of patients (two with haemothorax, one gastric
perforation) in the RFTA group and in none in two other groups (RFTA v PEI and PAI, p = 0.035).
Conclusions: RFTA was superior to PEI and PAI with respect to local recurrence, overall survival, and
cancer free survival rates, but RFTA also caused more major complications.
Asmall hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can be detected
early by regular ultrasound screening and measure￾ment of serum alpha fetoprotein.1 Several treatments
are available for the successful treatment of small HCCs. Of
these, surgical resection is the treatment of choice for small
HCCs with compensated liver function.2 3 However, local
intratumoral ablation therapies, including percutaneous
ethanol injection (PEI), percutaneous acetic acid injection
(PAI), and radiofrequency thermal ablation (RFTA) achieve a
tumour ablation rate similar to that of resection.2–11
Of the local ablation therapies, PEI has been extensively
used for the past 20 years and has been found to be safe and
effective.4–8 12 PAI has been used by several investigators11 13 14
and one investigation reported that PAI was more effective
than PEI with respect to lower local recurrence rates and
higher survival rates.11 RFTA has been reported to be superior
to PEI because of a slightly higher rate of complete tumour
necrosis, the need for fewer treatment sessions,8 and a
significantly higher local recurrence free survival.9 However,
there have been no randomised controlled trials comparing
these three treatments in terms of complications, complete
tumour necrosis, local tumour recurrence, new tumour
recurrence, overall survival, and cancer free survival. This
randomised controlled study was therefore conducted to
compare the above clinical outcomes of HCC following PEI,
PAI, and RFTA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design and characteristics of the patients
The study was conducted with the approval of the institu￾tional ethics committee. Written informed consent was
obtained from each patient and a family member.
The primary end point of the study was local recurrence.
Secondary end points were overall survival and cancer free
survival. At the time of planning this study, local recurrence
rate after PEI was reported to be 10.5–26%,6 7 after PAI 13%,11
and after RFTA 3.6%.15 Based on the assumption that the
local HCC recurrence rate would be 20% or more in the PEI
group, we calculated that approximately 50–60 patients
would be required in each group to achieve a power of 0.80
and a significance level of 0.05 to assess differences across the
three groups. However, it was decided to prematurely
terminate the study if there was a significant difference in
survival rates between the three groups by carrying out an
interim analysis every three months.
Enrolment criteria were: (a) adult patients with 1–3 HCCs
measuring (3 cm in diameter each, (b) HCC located at least
1 cm away from the hepatic hilum or gall bladder,
(c) absence of vascular invasion or extrahepatic metastasis,
(d) liver cirrhosis classified as Child-Pugh class A or B,
(e) prothrombin time three seconds less than that of control
values, (f) platelet count greater than 50 000/mm3
, and
(g) no previous treatment for HCC. Exclusion criteria were
patients with Child-Pugh class C, previous HCC treatment,
and tumour located within 1 cm of the liver hilum or
common bile duct. Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital, Taipei
and LinKuo, is a teaching hospital with a total of 3000 beds,
and 185 of these were available for patients from the

outpatient clinic of 35 attending physicians belonging to the
Department of Hepatogastroenterolgy, including the Liver
Research Unit. According to our computer files, on average,
1200 naı¨ve HCC patients visited our hospital annually
between 2000 and 2003. Between April 2000 and June
2002, 337 cirrhotic patients with HCCs ,3 cm were
encountered in our unit for percutaneous tumour ablation.
Of these, 36 patients refused randomisation and 114 patients
with HCCs ,3 cm were enrolled into another randomised
controlled trial comparing RFTA, conventional PEI, and high
dose PEI.16 The remaining 187 patients were randomised to
receive RFTA (62 patients), PEI (62 patients), or PAI (63
patients) during alternative weeks between April 2000 and
April 2002 and then every week between May 2002 and June
2002. Randomisation of treatments was generated by a
computer randomisation list that was not available to the
treating physician. HCC was diagnosed by pathological or
cytological studies of all tumours. Tumour diameters were
determined as the largest dimension measured by ultrasono￾graphy (US). The number of tumours and absence of vascular
invasion were determined by US, colour Doppler US, and
dynamic helical computed tomography (CT) imaging. Table 1
lists the clinical baseline parameters. There were no
significant differences between the three groups for any of
the parameters.
Conventional liver biochemical tests, prothrombin time,
and complete blood cell counts were measured before
treatment. Three phase helical CT imaging was used to
detect any enhancement of the tumour.
Percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI)
The first session of PEI was performed one day after CT
arterioportography. PEI was performed at the outpatient
clinic if there were no severe adverse effects after the first PEI
during hospitalisation. PEI was performed as described
previously.4 6–8 18 After local anaesthesia, a 22 gauge percutan￾eous transhepatic cholangiogram (PTC) needle was intro￾duced into the tumour under ultrasound guidance. Absolute
(99.5%) ethanol was injected at a dose of 2–10 ml per
session. Total volume was approximated using the modified
equation
V (ml) = 4/3 6 p (c+1)3
where c represents the radius of the tumour in centi￾metres.6 11 The procedure was repeated twice weekly until the
hyperechoic change of the tumour was complete, or for up to
six sessions per tumour per course, with a maximum of 12
sessions of treatment per tumour.8 17
Percutaneous acetic acid injection (PAI)
The first session of PAI was performed one day after CT
arterioportography. PAI was performed at the outpatient
clinic if there were no severe adverse effects after the first PAI
during hospitalisation. PAI was performed as described
previously.11 14 After local anaesthesia, 1–3 ml of 50% acetic
acid were injected using a 15–20 cm long 22 gauge PTC
needle under ultrasound guidance. Total volume was
approximated using a similar equation to that of PEI but
with one third of the volume of the ethanol injection.11 The
procedure was repeated and ended as for PEI.
Radiofrequency thermal ablation (RFTA)
RFTA was performed as described previously.15 19 After
intravenous analgesia and sedatives, as well as local
anaesthesia, a 12 cm or 15 cm long 15 gauge LeVeen
electrode was introduced into the tumour under US
guidance. The 10 hooks of the electrode were then deployed
into the tissue encompassing a diameter of 2–3.5 cm and the
electrode was connected to an RF generator (RF 2000;
RadioTherapeutics, Sunnyvale, California, USA). RFTA was
performed using either the manufacturer’s standard algo￾rithm or an interactive algorithm. The standard algorithm
was performed with a gradual increase in power until either
the power roll off was achieved or 15 minutes of treatment
time had elapsed. RF energy was then applied in a second
phase until either a second roll off was achieved or
10 minutes of treatment had elapsed. The beginning and
end of the interactive algorithm was identical to the standard
algorithm but the electrode’s array was partially retracted or
fully deployed depending on the change in impedance during
the procedure.20 The electrode was repositioned as required to
encompass large target tumours and mimic a surgical margin
of 1 cm for the target tumour. The procedure was repeated
two weeks later until hypoattenuation of the tumour on CT
scan was achieved, or for up to two courses, two weeks apart,
per tumour.8

Assessing the effect of RFTA, PEI, and PAI
The immediate effects of ablation were assessed using helical
CT performed two weeks after treatment. Helical CT was
performed using a Prospeed plus system (General Electric
Medical System, Yokogawa, Japan). If foci of nodular
enhancement were noted in the treated tumour under CT,
then PEI, PAI, and an RFTA booster were given as part of
another course of treatment. The CT scan was repeated two
weeks after the booster treatment. Complete tumour necrosis
was defined as persistent hypoattenuation of the tumour on
CT scan four months after the most recent ablation
therapy.8 20 Serum alpha fetoprotein was also measured two
weeks after ablation. When baseline levels of serum alpha
fetoprotein were abnormal they was rechecked every month.
Long term outcome was assessed in terms of complica￾tions, local recurrence, new HCC recurrence, overall survival,
and cancer free survival. Major complications were defined as
those that if left untreated might threaten the patient’s life,
lead to substantial morbidity and disability, or result in
hospital admission or a substantially lengthened hospital
stay.21 Follow up examinations included monitoring serum
alpha fetoprotein levels, and US and helical CT every two to
three months periodically. Follow up ended on 31 January
2004. Local recurrence of HCC (equivalent to persistence of
the original target tumour) was defined as the presence of an
enhanced tumour on CT, corresponding to the initial target
tumour. New occurrence of HCC was defined as the
development of an enhanced tumour on CT in a different
segment from that of the original tumour.
Statistical analysis
The Student’s t test was performed to compare differences
between the PEI, PAI, and RFTA groups. The x2 or Fisher’s
exact test was used to compare proportions between the three
groups. Local recurrence, new recurrence, overall survival,
and cancer free survival were estimated using the Kaplan￾Meier method, and differences between groups were com￾pared using the log rank test. Multiple comparisons were
made when the three groups were involved. Univariate
and multivariate analysis with age (.60 v (60 years), sex,
Child-Pugh grade (A v B), hepatitis B virus (HBV) related
versus non-HBV related underlying liver disease, two or three
tumours versus single tumour, size of tumour (.2 cm v
(2 cm), tumour stain on angiography, Edmondson’s grade
(III, IV v I, II), serum alpha fetoprotein level (>200 v
,200 ng/ml), platelet count ((60 000 v .60 000/mm3
), and
treatment (RFTA v PEI or PAI) were performed using Cox’s
regression model with proportional hazards. A p value of less
than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
RESULTS
Adverse effects
Severe pain was experienced by one patient treated with PEI,
three patients treated with PAI, and three patients treated
with RFTA, which required analgesia. Transient pleural
effusion was encountered in three patients following RFTA,
two of whom developed haemothorax and required chest
tube drainage; these patients subsequently recovered. Gastric
injury with bleeding and perforation of the gastric fundus
was evident in one patient 10 days after RFTA. This patient
underwent gastric repair during operation and subsequently
recovered. The major complication rate was 4.8% (3/62
patients, including two patients with haemothorax and one
with gastric bleeding and perforation) in the RFTA group and
0% of 125 patients in the PEI and PAI groups (RFTA v PEI
and PAI; p = 0.035). No other severe adverse effects were
observed.
Complete tumour necrosis
Of 187 patients, three tumours in two patients in the RFTA
group, nine tumours in seven patients in the PEI group, and
six tumours in five patients in the PAI group did not achieve
complete tumour necrosis following two courses of therapy
and were considered treatment failures, as defined by other
investigators.8 17 These 14 patients received additional and
alternative therapies. The rate of complete tumour necrosis
was 96.1% (75/78 HCC tumours) in the RFTA group, 88.1%
(67/76 HCC tumours) in the PEI group, and 92.4% (73/79
HCC tumours) in the PAI group. The number of sessions
required to achieve complete tumour necrosis were signifi￾cantly fewer in the RFTA group than in the PEI or PAI group.
Hospitalisation of patients in the PEI group was significantly
shorter than that in the PAI or RFTA group (table 2).

Ninety eight of 134 patients exhibited elevated baseline
alpha fetoprotein levels, and these levels decreased to normal
(,20 ng/ml) within 4.5 months after therapy. For 53
patients with normal baseline alpha fetoprotein concentra￾tions, levels remained normal in 48, six months after therapy.
Fifty seven of 98 patients with normalisation of alpha
fetoprotein levels after therapy experienced another rise in
alpha fetoprotein levels when either local or new HCC
recurrence was detected.
Local and new HCC recurrence
After a median of 35 months (mean 26.3 (SD 12.7); range
4–44) of follow up, two patients in the RFTA group, two in
the PEI group, and three in the PAI group were lost to follow
up due to HCC recurrence; these patients opted for Chinese
herbal treatments. The local recurrence rate was 13.3% (8/60)
in the RFTA group, 34.5% (19/55) in the PEI group, and
29.3% (17/58) in the PAI group. Cumulative local recurrence
rates for the main tumour at the end of one, two, and three
years were 10%, 14%, and 14% in the RFTA group, 16%, 34%,
and 34% in the PEI group, and 14%, 31%, and 31% in the PAI
group, respectively. The local recurrence rate was signifi￾cantly lower in the RFTA group compared with the PEI group
(risk ratio (RR) = 0.35 (95% confidence interval (95% CI)
0.21–0.89); p = 0.012) and the PAI group (RR = 0.41 (95% CI
0.23–0.91); p = 0.017) (fig 1). The cumulative local recur￾rence rate was significantly lower in patients with HCCs
smaller than 2 cm compared with those with HCCs larger
than 2 cm in each group. The cumulative local recurrence
rate in patients with HCCs .2 cm was only significantly
lower in the RFTA group compared with the PEI group
(RR = 0.19 (95% CI 0.08–0.48); p = 0.009) and the PAI group
(RR 0.36 (95% CI 0.25–0.89); p = 0.011) whereas the
comparison was not significant in patients with HCCs
(2 cm across the three groups (table 3). Multivariate
analysis revealed that the only significant factors related to
local recurrence were tumour size (.2 cm v (2 cm;
p = 0.012), Edmondson’s grade (III, IV v I, II; p = 0.018),
and treatment method (RFTA v PEI and PAI; p = 0.021). All
patients with local recurrence were treated with the same
treatment.
New HCC occurred in 18 patients in the RFTA group, 19 in
the PEI group, and 21 in the PAI group. The cumulative new
HCC recurrence rates at the end of one, two, and three years
were 25%, 37%, and 45% in the RFTA group, 23%, 40%, and
48% in the PEI group, and 21%, 40%, and 46% in the PAI
group. No significant difference was found among the three
groups. Extrahepatic metastasis to intra-abdominal lymph
nodes was found in one patient in the RFTA group. Forty six
patients with new HCC recurrences were treated with the
same treatment, and the remaining 12 patients were treated
with alternative therapies.
Overall survival rate and cancer free survival rate
Ten, 17, and 15 patients in the RFTA, PEI, and PAI groups,
respectively, died during follow up. The causes of death
included HCC progression in four, hepatic failure in three,

oesophageal variceal bleeding in two, and pre-existing
uraemia in one patient in the RFTA group; HCC progression
in 10, hepatic failure in four, spontaneous bacterial perito￾nitis and sepsis in one, and oesophageal variceal bleeding in
two patients in the PEI group; HCC progression in nine,
hepatic failure in five, and oesophageal variceal bleeding in
one patient in the PAI group. The overall survival rates at one,
two, and three years were 93%, 81%, and 74% in the RFTA
group, 88%, 66%, and 51% in the PEI group, and 90%, 67%,
and 53% in the PAI group (fig 2). Overall survival rate was
higher in the RFTA group compared with the PEI group
(RR = 0.42 (95% CI 0.21–0.98); p = 0.031) and PAI
(RR = 0.45 (95% CI 0.06–0.58); p = 0.038) groups. No
significant difference was seen between the PEI and PAI
groups. Multivariate analysis revealed that the only signifi￾cant factors related to overall survival were tumour size
(.2 cm v (2 cm; p = 0.037), Edmondson’s grade (III, IV v I,
II; p = 0.031), and treatment method (RFTA v PEI and PAI;
p = 0.024).
Cancer free survival rates at one, two, and three years were
74%, 60%, and 43% in the RFTA group, 70%, 41%, and 21% in
the PEI group, and 71%, 43%, and 23% in the PAI group
(fig 3). Cancer free survival rate was higher in the RFTA
group compared with the PEI group (RR = 0.31 (95% CI 0.18–
0.85); p = 0.038) and the PAI group (RR = 0.26 (95% CI 0.13–
0.81); p = 0.041). No significant difference was found
between the PEI and PAI groups. Multivariate analysis
revealed that tumour size (.2 cm v (2 cm; p = 0.041),
Edmondson’s grade of tumour (III, IV v I, II; p = 0.036), and
treatment method (RFTA v PEI and PAI; p = 0.031) were the
only significant independent factors that affected the cancer
free survival rate.
DISCUSSION
The advantages of PEI and PAI are that they are easy to
perform and have greater safety and tolerance than RFTA.
However, RFTA has the advantage of requiring fewer
treatment sessions and yielding a higher rate of complete
tumour necrosis and local recurrence free survival at the risk
of a higher rate of major complications.8 9 Moreover, there
have been no trials comparing all three treatments, which are
necessary to determine the incidence of major complications
and clinical outcome in a single centre.
RFTA is generally considered a relatively low risk proce￾dure.21 In this study, although the incidence of major
complications was significantly higher in the RFTA group
(RFTA v PEI and PAI: 4.8% v 0%; p = 0.035), no RFTA related
deaths occurred. The rate (4.8%) of major complications in
this study was less than the 13.1% (10) of 76 patients in the
study of Curley et al using the same LeVeen electrode and RF
generator15 but slightly higher than the 2.4% (56) of 2320
patients (p.0.1), including six deaths, in a multicentre
analysis using a cool tip electrode.21
The present results showed a slightly higher rate of
complete necrosis in the RFTA group. The rate of complete
tumour necrosis between the RFTA and PEI groups after two
treatment cycles was similar to that of Livraghi and
colleagues8 (90% v 80%) and that of Lencioni and colleagues9
(98.5% v 94.5%).
The local recurrence rate was higher in patients with HCCs
larger than 2 cm (table 3). This finding was similar to those
in other reports.11 22 The independent factors related to local
recurrence were large tumour size (.2 cm) and high
Edmondson’s grade of tumour. This result was consistent
with that of Komorizono and colleagues.22 A larger tumour
usually has a higher rate of local recurrence because it
frequently requires multiple overlapping ablations, and
targeting of its viable foci is difficult because of lack of
clarity of the image obtained between the ablated and
non-ablated tumour after repeated ablation is performed
under sonography.23 Moreover, a high grade HCC probably
has satellite nodules that are further away from the main
nodule,24 possibly implying that local recurrence in the same
segment can be caused by satellite nodules that may be
obscured under sonography. Moreover, a larger tumour is
more often manifest with higher differentiation,25 thus
having satellite nodules along or above the margin of the
tumour which might be obscured during sonography. Despite
the wider range (1 cm safety margin) of injections of ethanol
or acetic acid herein, the distribution of ethanol or acetic acid
might be unpredictable both within the tumour and outside
due to interference of the fibrous septum11 and the presence
of satellite nodules around the target tumour,24 respectively.
Therefore, a 1 cm safety margin can be achieved in patients
treated with RFTA but not in patients treated with PEI or
PAI. This limitation of the homogenous distribution of
ethanol or acetic acid around the safety margin of the target
tumour may explain the benefit of lower local recurrence
favouring RFTA than PEI or PAI in treating HCCs larger than
2 cm in the present study or in other investigations.11 22
The rates of new HCC recurrence were also similar among
the three groups, perhaps because of the similar baseline
parameters.
Our results also showed that overall survival was sig￾nificantly higher in the RFTA group than in the PEI and PAI
groups. This finding is different from that of Lencioni and
colleagues.9 The reason may be that the observation period
was longer in our study (mean follow up 26.3 months in this
study compared with 22 months in Lencioni’s study).
However, Lencioni’s study also showed a trend towards
increased survival in the RFTA group.9 The cause of death
was HCC progression in most cases. Therefore, a more
effective local treatment such as RFTA can achieve lower HCC
recurrence and consequently contributes to better survival.
Cancer free survival reflects local recurrence and new
tumour formation elsewhere in the liver. Because lower
recurrence was lower in the RFTA group therefore the cancer
free survival rate was also lower in RFTA group than in the
two other groups in this study. This finding is similar to that
of Lencioni and colleagues.9
Although we used an RF generator with a lower power
(100 W) and the LeVeen electrode with a small diameter (up
to 3.5 cm only), the study still showed a better clinical
outcome with RFTA than with PEI or PAI in treating HCCs of
3 cm or less. More recent advances in the RF generator with a
higher power (up to 200 W) and RF electrodes with a larger
ablation zone (up to 5 cm in diameter) may increase the rate
of complete necrosis, local recurrence, and overall survival
and cancer free survival when these new devices are used to
perform RFTA in small HCCs or even in larger HCCs.
We conclude that RFTA yielded a better outcome with
respect to lower local recurrence, higher overall survival, and
higher cancer free survival than PEI or PAI in treating HCCs
of 3 cm or less. However, RFTA also caused significantly
higher major complications than PEI or PAI.

GUT TUTORIAL..................................................................................................
Crohn’s or abdominal tuberculosis?
Educational objectives
The case is designed first to explore the differential diagnosis
between Crohn’s disease and abdominal tuberculosis. It is
intended that the participating doctor should be re-famil￾iarised with the older diagnostic tools and methods, and be
brought up to date with newer thoughts and approaches. As
the case is worked through, the diagnosis becomes clear and
the participant can then explore the various different
management strategies now available in the various clinical
contexts that the case presents.
After working through the tutorial you should be familiar
with the above diagnostic and management aspects includ￾ing:
N Methodology for establishing a differential diagnosis for
chronic abdominal symptomatology of probable organic
nature
N Immediate management plans for the condition once
diagnosed
N More subtle aspects of initial and short term management
N Longer term issues that arise from treatment and its
(potential) complications
Clinical data
A middle-ranking diplomat aged 29 presents with a four
week history of lower abdominal pain and diarrhoea. The
pain is described as moderate and is generally relieved by
defaecation. The diarrhoea is free of blood but half of the
stools are liquid; there is now a total stool frequency of eight
times in 24 hours, which wakes him from sleep on most
nights. He suspects that he has lost weight but has no scales
at home, and night sweats have raised the possibility that he
has also had intermittent pyrexia. He had not had problems
with his joints, skin, or eyes, but felt himself to be in a poor
state overall.
He had previously been well but had been posted for three
month periods both to Thailand and to Washington during
the previous nine months. As a child he had lived in Delhi
with his parents who were also in the diplomatic service.
There had been some minor problems before his trip to
Thailand as the occupational health service had been unable
to establish his tuberculin status with confidence. The Heaf
test was weakly positive but the patient did not remember
ever receiving BCG vaccination. A chest radiograph was
normal.
He admitted to smoking cannabis on a regular basis and
drank approximately 24 units of alcohol each week. There
was no other history apart from tonsillectomy at age 7 years.
His mother has a mild form of relapsing multiple sclerosis.

Bacterial DNA induces a
proinflammatory immune
response in patients with
decompensated cirrhosis
We read with interest the study of
Thalheimer et al (Gut 2005;54:556–63) in
which they reviewed actual knowledge regard￾ing the influence of infection on haemo￾dynamics, variceal haemorrhage, heparinoid
effects, liver damage, and other effects.
We agree with these assumptions and
would like to add information not quoted in
the paper that may help explain some of the
immune abnormalities usually found in
patients with advanced decompensated cir￾rhosis. As the authors detailed in their paper,
our group has reported on the detection of
bacterial DNA in a significant proportion of
patients with cirrhosis and culture negative
non-neutrocytic ascites,1 and has also shown
that these fragments may last in blood for
variable periods of time.2 In our opinion, the
presence of bacterial DNA is not only
representative in itself of the presence of
bacteria (either viable or non-viable) in our
patients, but induces similar immunological
changes as endotoxin or viable bacteria. The
question of whether bacterial DNA also
induces haemodynamic disturbances is cur￾rently under investigation.
Bacterial DNA contains a series of CpG
motifs that join toll-like receptor 9 and
activates a series of intracellular mechanisms
leading to the synthesis of proinflammatory
cytokines.3 We therefore observed that peri￾toneal white cells obtained from ascitic fluid
in patients with the presence of bacterial
DNA showed a marked activation pattern
when the intracellular presence of cytokines
involved in a type 1 immune response by
means of flow cytometry was analysed,4 and
also an increased ability to secrete this type of
cytokines when cultured.5 Importantly, white
cells in culture also displayed a significantly
higher ability to secrete nitric oxide than cells
obtained from patients without the presence
of bacterial DNA, and nitric oxide levels
showed a direct and significant relationship
with the inducible form of nitric oxide
synthase,5 suggesting that in this setting,
ascitic fluid nitric oxide synthesis is, at least
in part, induced by this isoform.
Nitric oxide is a key agent in the pathogen￾esis of haemodynamic disturbances present
in patients with advanced cirrhosis, and
its levels are further increased in patients
with hepatorenal syndrome.6 Ascitic fluid
nitric oxide levels are independently related
to the development of renal impairment
in patients with spontaneous bacterial
peritonitis.7
Thus the relation between the presence of
bacterial DNA in blood and the ability to
secrete proinflammatory cytokines and nitric
oxide by cells of the immune system in
patients with decompensated cirrhosis sug￾gest that endotoxin and viable bacteria
should not only be taken into account in
the design of new research protocols, but also
bacterial DNA, or similar molecules, as
demonstration of the presence of bacteria in
patients with advanced cirrhosis.

Author’s reply
We are grateful to Such et al for their
comments on our review. As we had outlined,
the influence of bacterial infection on the
pathophysiology of cirrhosis is indeed an
important one and Such et al have contrib￾uted significantly to this topic.1–4 We were
aware of their data, but unfortunately some
of it could not be retained in the final version
of our paper due to editorial restrictions.
Nevertheless, we agree that the presence of
bacterial DNA, in the absence of viable
bacteria or endotoxaemia, might be an
additional step in the sequence of events
outlined in fig 2 of our review, maybe even
preliminary to endotoxaemia.

Perinatal passive smoke
exposure may be more important
than childhood exposure in the
risk of developing childhood IBD
The large case control study of patients with
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in the
French paediatric population by Baron et al
has clarified the role of well established
genetic and environmental risk factors, as
well as suggesting novel environmental risk
factors (Gut 2005;54:357–63).
However, we caution the authors on dis￾missal of the role of passive smoking in the
risk of IBD development in childhood. Our
own data would suggest that analysing
smoking data during pregnancy and at birth
is more important in the development of
childhood IBD, rather than assessing smok￾ing during childhood and at disease onset, as
performed in this current study.
We have performed a case control study in
South East Scotland of children with early
onset IBD, matching cases of IBD diagnosed
at less than 16 years of age with same sex
and age (¡1) year controls attending the
same general practice.1 In total, we matched
62 pairs of cases and controls, with a median
age of disease onset in cases of 10.6 years. We
demonstrated that parental smoking during
pregnancy and around the time of birth was
more common in parents of IBD cases, at 54%
compared with control parents at 29%
(p = 0.01; odds ratio (OR) 2.87 (95% con￾fidence interval (CI) 1.23–6.66)). Maternal
smoking during pregnancy and at birth was
also more common in IBD cases than in
controls, at 23% versus 6.2% (p = 0.04; OR
4.46 (95% CI 1.16–17.1), and in mothers of
patients with Crohn’s disease, at 27.8%
versus control mothers at 8.3% (p = 0.03;
OR 4.23 (95% CI 1.05–16.97)). There was no
significant effect seen when paternal smok￾ing in pregnancy and at birth was analysed in
IBD cases versus controls (p = 0.27). These

data replicate the publication by Lashner and
colleagues2 who studied 72 IBD cases and
controls and found a similar relationship to
smoking at birth—this was increased in
children who later developed IBD in child￾hood (OR 3.02) and CD in childhood (OR
5.32).3 The authors of this study also demon￾strated that maternal smoking at birth was
important in the development of IBD and
CD.2
We agree with the findings of Baron et al
that parental/passive smoke exposure outside
of the perinatal period, including at the time
of IBD diagnosis, is not associated with the
risk of developing IBD in children (p = 0.18).
This lack of association between passive
smoke exposure in childhood and develop￾ment of childhood IBD has also been
replicated by Lashner and colleagues.2 It is
important to note that the other studies
quoted by Baron et al in relation to the risk
of passive smoking in IBD patients relate to
the risk of adult onset IBD after passive
smoke exposure during childhood, not the
risk of developing IBD as a child.3 4 The
mechanism by which smoke exposure during
pregnancy and at birth leads to an increased
risk of childhood IBD can only be a subject
for speculation, but it is interesting to note a
recent study has demonstrated chromosomal
abnormalities in fetal epithelial cells in
women who smoke during pregnancy.5
In conclusion, our study agrees with
previously published data to suggest a role
between passive smoke exposure during
pregnancy and at birth with the risk of
childhood development of IBD. When asses￾sing passive smoking in relation to childhood
onset IBD, investigators should survey smoke

Author’s reply
We thank Russell et al for their interest in our
study, concerning the link between passive
smoking and the risk of IBD in children.
We agree that it is important to take into
account the role of passive smoking not only
during childhood and at disease onset but
also during the perinatal period. We also
looked at this point in our study but came to
different conclusions: 9.6% of mothers of IBD
patients smoked during pregnancy versus
9.25% of control mothers (odds ratio (OR)
0.95 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53–
1.72); p = 0.88). When considering only
mothers of Crohn’s disease patients and
control mothers, values were 9.9% and
9.5%, respectively (OR 0.95 (95% CI 0.50–
1.81); p = 0.87). Moreover, concerning pas￾sive smoking during childhood, the findings
were 14.2% and 12.8% for IBD patients and
controls, respectively (OR 0.87 (95% CI 0.52–
1.46); p = 0.60) and 15.3% for Crohn’s
disease patients versus 14.4% for controls
(OR 0.92 (95% CI 0.53–1.61); p = 0.77).
Due to the high number of questions and
findings in our case control study, we only
reported positive findings and what we
considered as being the most important
negative results. In conclusion, we confirm
that in our study there was no link between
IBD and passive smoking, including exposure
during pregnancy and at birth.

An alternative to prophylactic
colectomy for colon cancer
prevention in HNPCC syndrome
The surgical option for treatment of a patient
with screen detected colorectal cancer (CRC)
from a family with hereditary non-polyposis
colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is subtotal colect￾omy or segmental resection. Using decision
analysis, we showed that subtotal colectomy
performed at a young age leads to an
increased life expectancy (LE) of 1–2.3 years.
Based on these results and the high risk of
developing a second CRC, we concluded that
if CRC is detected in a young patient
participating in a surveillance programme,
colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis seems
to be the treatment of choice.
A French Committee on HNPCC commen￾ted on our study.1 Firstly, they stated that
using quality adjusted LE would be a more
accurate approach. We agree completely but
studies on quality of life (QOL) did not
specifically consider HNPCC patients. In
HNPCC, QOL after segmental resection may
be decreased by the need for colonoscopy
(versus rectoscopy after colectomy) and the
fear of a second tumour. Secondly, the
committee considered our five year survival
rates optimistic. The five year survival rates
for HNPCC patients with Dukes’ B cancer
varied in the literature from 70% to 91% and
those for patients with Dukes’ C from 19% to
70%.2–6 These survival rates are similar to
those used in our analysis. Thirdly, the
committee mentioned that the overall five
year survival of patients with CRC in HNPCC
is approximately 55%. They stated that if the
decision for an extended resection is made
before the pathological staging of the tumour
is known, 45% of patients will sustain a
substantial decrease in QOL with no counter￾part in quantity (that is, LE). The committee
referred to the survival (55%) of symptomatic
CRC in HNPCC. In our study, we discussed
the surgical options for patients with CRC
detected during surveillance. In our table 1,
we showed the stage distribution of screen
detected CRC based on our study and the
Finnish series.7 As 86% had local cancer, the
five year survival will be higher than 55%.
Fourthly, the committee indicated that only a
very small proportion of patients will be
identified with CRC by the age of 27 years
and that the increased LE for patients with
CRC diagnosed at age 47 years was only one
year. Half of the patients with screen detected
CRC will be diagnosed before the age of
50 years and will have a substantial increase
of LE of 1–2.3 years. Fifthly, the committee
stressed that different indications should be
made in men and women because of their
different risks for metachronous cancer as
well as for the competing risk of endometrial
cancer. Although female mutation carriers
may have a lower risk of CRC than male
carriers, it has not been shown that they also
have a lower risk of a second CRC. In fact,
among HNPCC patients that developed a
second tumour, we found more females than
males.8 Female mutation carriers do indeed
have a high risk of developing endometrial
cancer but this cancer is only a rare cause of
death in HNPCC.
As stated by the committee, it is difficult
for a patient diagnosed with CRC to decide
between an increase in LE and a potential
decrease in their QOL. An increased LE is a
somewhat theoretical concept that entails
additional years at the end of one’s life while
the negative impact on QOL of subtotal
colectomy will start from the first post￾operative day. On the other hand, it may be
even more difficult for a physician to explain
to a patient that has developed CRC under
surveillance that after segmental resection,
surveillance of the remaining colon will
prevent cancer development. It is possible
that this patient will be happy after removal
of the colon as now they are at a substantially
lower risk of developing a second CRC. We
agree that the patient’s choice is pivotal in
decisions on prophylactic surgery, after being
fully informed of the pros and cons of the
surgical options.

Defective denominators
I was interested in the paper by Langlands et
al in which ‘‘prebiotic’’ carbohydrates altered
the mucosal flora but apparently had no
effect on cell proliferation (Gut 2004;53:
1610–16). The matter is of some importance
as the products of in vivo fermentation (short
chain fatty acids) may increase epithelial cell
proliferation, leading to the possibility that
such supplements could actually enhance the
risk of colorectal cancer.1 2
The authors state that methodology (of gut
microflora study) is always an important
issue and I argue that this also applies to cell
proliferation studies, as the results of the
present work may be misleading on two
counts. Firstly, I would never recommend the
use of proliferating cell nuclear antigen as a
marker of cell proliferation as: (1) the
method is difficult to standardise; (2) the
antigen has a long half life; and (3) anom￾alous expression has been demonstrated in
non-cycling near tumours and after admin￾istration of growth factors.3 For sections, Ki67
is far better however even using this antibody
the results of the present study are unlikely to
be conclusive as only 2–4 crypts could be
scored; for most studies I would recommend
scoring 30 hemi crypts.
The second point is that reliance on
labelling indices can be misleading as lack
of difference does not necessarily mean no
proliferative change as both sides of the ratio
(labelled cells divided by number of cells)
could have altered. This was demonstrated in
our studies of epidermal growth factor in
parenterally fed rats where no differences in
labelling index between orally fed and
parenterally fed rats could be seen despite
halving tissue weight and crypt cell produc￾tion. When the data were re-expressed as
labelling per crypt, the effects of treatment
became apparent4
; a similar effect was
seen in the stomach following misoprostol
treatment.5 6
There is however a far easier and well
validated method available for the study of
human tissue. This is the so-called micro￾dissection technique in which small pieces of
stained material are teased apart and mitotic
figures scored.7 This literally allows one to
score over 100 crypts (if so wished) and as
the results are expressed per crypt the effects
of changes in denominator are automatically
accounted for.

Author’s reply
We thank Goodlad for his interest in our
article. In our study (Gut 2004;53:1610–16),
we assessed expression of the three markers
most commonly used to indicate cell cycle
entry in tissue sections. Importantly, there
was no difference in the data obtained for all
three. We agree that proliferating cell nuclear
antigen is of limited value for the reasons
mentioned by Goodlad and also the fact that
the protein has a role in DNA repair, which
reduces its specificity as a cell cycle marker.
Similarly, Ki67 is not expressed by all cycling
cells, may be downregulated by nutritional
deprivation, and may also be involved in non￾cell cycle related processes, such as ribosomal
biosynthesis.1
We consider that the most useful markers
of cycling cells are the minichromosome
maintenance (MCM) proteins, which are
abundant at all phases of the cell cycle and
are downregulated following exit into quies￾cence, differentiation, or senescence.1 2
MCMs therefore provide a sensitive and
specific indication of cell cycle entry. In our
opinion these markers are preferable to
counting mitotic figures, which is a subjective
and error prone exercise that by definition
provides a limited phase specific indication of
cell cycle state in histological sections.
We agree that proliferation indices can be
misleading and that when assessing large
bowel crypts it is important to determine the
number of labelled cells per crypt.3 We
confirm that the mucosa in all subjects in
our study was microscopically normal, as well
as macroscopically normal, as stated. In
particular, there was no difference in crypt
length and number of cells per crypt between
the study groups. The labelling indices
determined were therefore valid indicators
of cell cycle entry in the samples investigated.
Prebiotic carbohydrates, such as those used
in our study, are completely fermented in the
large bowel and none is excreted in faeces.
The principal products of this fermentation
are short chain fatty acids (SCFA). While
SCFA have been associated with increased
cell proliferation in some animal models, it is
hard to believe that what are the major
anions in the colon of all mammalian species
should enhance the risk of cancer, particu￾larly since one of these fatty acids, butyrate,
is thought to be a differentiating agent.
Fermented carbohydrates, such as dietary
fibre, when measured properly in the diet,
appear to protect against colorectal cancer in
observational studies.4 The observed lack of
effect of prebiotic carbohydrates on colono￾cyte proliferation in our study suggests that a
substantial increase in fermentable carbohy￾drate intake, as provided by these prebiotics,
does not enhance proliferation, as shown in
some animal models, and thus might be
regarded as adding to the protective role of
the fermentable non-starch polysaccharides
(fibre).

Author’s reply
Further to Cummings and Coleman’s reply to
my letter above, I would like to question the
advocacy of minichromosome maintenance
(MCM) proteins as proliferative markers, as
the number of MCM positive cells can greatly
exceed other labels and they are widely dis￾tributed on unreplicated chromatin.1 They
would appear to be more of an indicator of
replication potential and, as such, are likely
to be useful markers of dysplasia.2 In addi￾tion, scoring immunohistochemical labelled
cells is just as, if not more, ‘‘subjective and
error prone’’ than scoring mitotic figures
(which are far easier to score in ‘‘squash’’
preparations than in sections). My main

concern still stands, as scoring histological
sections of human biopsies, unlike squash
preparations, leads to the sampling of a very
limited number of crypts (2–4 in the present
study) which prevents credence of the
‘‘observed lack of effect’’ of prebiotic carbo￾hydrates.
Finally, I think that the jury is still out on
the ‘‘protective role’’ of fermentable non￾starch polysaccharides (fibre) as while the
EPIC study showed a dramatic effect of
intrinsically high fibre diets,3 many others
have shown null effects and some of these,
especially the intervention ones, demon￾strated adverse effects. For example, wheat
bran supplementation increased polyp recur￾rence in women4 and ispaghula had a more
general adverse effect on polyps.5

Author’s reply
We sought to identify cells at any point of the
cell cycle, regardless of the rate of cycling or
the duration of particular cell cycle phases.
We therefore elected not to assess individual
cell cycle phases in our samples, either by
immunostaining or by counting mitotic figures.
While additional roles for minichromo￾some maintenance (MCM) proteins have
been suggested, there is strong evidence that
they function as essential replication factors.1
MCMs are displaced from chromatin follow￾ing DNA replication, yet remain abundant in
the nucleus throughout the cell cycle.2
Importantly, several groups have shown that
MCMs are lost following cell cycle exit (into
differentiation, quiescence, or senescence).3–5
MCMs are therefore useful immunohisto￾chemical markers of cell cycle state. It is not
surprising that MCMs are more abundant
than Ki67 and proliferating cell nuclear
antigen (PCNA), as the latter markers are
not detectable in all cycling cells.
Objectivity and reproducibility in the inter￾pretation of immunohistochemical staining
are functions of the marker used. Some
markers, such as PCNA, produce substantial
variation in staining intensity and cause
difficulty in slide interpretation. However, our
MCM antibodies have not provided us with
such difficulties, resulting in low interobserver
variation in numerous studies to date.2
Interpreting observational and intervention
studies of fibre has filled many journal pages
in recent years. There are numerous problems
which, in the context of the present discus￾sion, relate primarily to people treating all
sources of fibre as being equal, thinking that
fibre supplements will have the same effect
as fibre present in whole foods in the diet and
the amounts of fibre considered to be protec￾tive. With regard to the study by Alberts and
colleagues,6 the fibre was provided as a
supplement and was only of wheat bran. As
Goodlad and Alferez correctly note, the EPIC
study showed a protective effect for fibre
when intrinsically part of the diet, and from
mixed sources. In other words, it is a high
fibre diet that protects. The Bonithon-Kopp
study7 used a fibre supplement, ispaghula,
not found in most diets of the world, and at a
very small dose of only about 3 g/day.

Recurrence of exhausting hiccup
in a patient treated with
chemotherapy for metastatic
colon cancer
A 61 year old man was surgically treated for a
pT3 Nl-G2 MO adenocarcinoma of the colon
in February 2003. Immediately after surgery,
an enteric fistula occurred that caused a delay
in administration of adjuvant treatment.
At the start of adjuvant chemotherapy (CT)
in May 2003, CEA level was 18.2 ng/ml and a
new work-up with computed tomography
scan of the thorax and abdomen revealed the
early appearance of two metastatic lesions in
the liver. The patient underwent liver metas￾tasectomy and in July 2003 was started on
post-surgical systemic CT with the FOL-FIRI
(leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan) regi￾men every 14 days for six months. During the
second course of CT the patient experienced
severe hiccup which was treated with meto￾clopramide without improvement. Hiccup
was ascribed to the use of irinotecan and
the patient subsequently received, at every CT
administration, prophylactic oral chlorpro￾mazine with significant reduction of the
symptom. This approach yielded completion
of the CT programme.
In January 2005, relapse of disease
occurred in the liver that was not surgically
manageable and the patient was started on
the FOL-FOX (leucovorin, 5-fluorouracil,
oxaliplatin) regimen. After day 1 of CT,
recurrence of an exhausting hiccup was
observed that continued for nine days after
therapy. No benefit from the re-use of
chlorpromazine was obtained.
Notably, while undergoing the two CT
regimens, the patient had received intrave￾nous ondansetron (8 mg) plus intravenous
dexamethasone (8 mg), which was used for
prophylaxis of delayed emesis. In order to
identify the causative drug of hiccup and
taking into consideration previous reports
indicating dexamethasone as a possible cause
of hiccup,1 2 during the following cycles of CT
this drug was omitted. This approach allowed
the patient to continue CT without recurrence
of hiccup.
The strong temporal relation between
dexamethasone administration and occur￾rence of hiccup indicated that this drug was
the cause of the patient’s hiccup. Moreover,
discontinuing dexamethasone was sufficient
to achieve disappearance of hiccup without
any further pharmacological intervention.
The mechanism of corticosteroid induced
hiccup is unknown, although some hypoth￾eses have been proposed.3 4 For example, it
has been suggested that there is a hiccup
centre in the midbrain that receives input
from the thoracic sympathetic nerves and the
pharyngeal plexus. It has been proposed that
stimulation of the midbrain or these various
pathways may be responsible for production
of hiccup. Moreover, animal studies sug￾gested that corticosteroids may reduce the
synaptic transmission threshold in the mid￾brain and affect the metabolism of brain
neurotransmitters.5 6
We reported our case to make oncologists
aware that a symptom appearing during CT
treatment (hiccup in our case) should not
always be ascribed to the use of antineoplas￾tic drugs. It is also true that some cytotoxic
drugs, such as irinotecan and cyclophospha￾mide, have been implicated as a cause of
hiccup.7 8 In particular, the incidence of
hiccup after treatment with irinotecan was
reported in 49/16518 patients and, as for
other cytotoxic drugs, almost exclusively in
men (49/9313).7

macroscopic subtypes: flat (F)-type, which is
composed of superficially spreading lesions
with flat and smooth surfaces, and granular
(G)-type, which is composed of superficially
spreading aggregates of nodules.2 Despite
distinctive biological behaviours of LSTs, only
a few genetic alterations have been reported,
such as K-ras and p53 mutations3 4 and
cyclooxygenase 2 overexpression.5
A 62 year old Japanese woman was
referred to our hospital for treatment of a
colonic tumour. Colonoscopy in our hospital
showed an F-type LST with a central depres￾sion surrounded by a flat elevated area with a
smooth surface in the caecum (fig 1A).
Microscopically, the tumour consisted of a
well differentiated adenocarcinoma with a
tubular adenoma and had invaded the sub￾mucosal layer.
After obtaining informed consent from the
patient, genetic analysis was carried out. No
genetic alterations were found in APC, K-ras,
or p53 genes. To clarify relevant alterations of
gene expression, we analysed the gene expres￾sion profiles by a cDNA array.6 Among 550
cancer related genes, bone morphogenic pro￾tein 4 (BMP4) was one of the most differen￾tially expressed genes in tumor tissues and
matched normal tissues (fig 1B). BMP4 is a
member of the transforming growth factor b
superfamily of growth factors. As BMP4
expression is reportedly correlated with onco￾genic b-catenin in human colon cancer cells,7
we analysed alterations in b-catenin in
tumour tissues. Intense nuclear expression of
b-catenin was immunohistochemically seen
within the nuclei of tumor cells (fig 1C). No
point mutations of b-catenin were detected.
Interstitial deletion was then examined by
polymerase chain reaction. A shorter band was
detected in tumor tissues compared with the
normal size of 931 base pairs (bp) (fig 1D).
DNA sequencing showed an interstitial dele￾tion of 394 bp in tumor tissues (fig 2). Three
base inverted repeats, AGC and GCT, were
found in the sequences flanking the inter￾stitial deletion. Short nucleotide sequences at
both ends of the deletion were complemen￾tary, suggesting that inversely repeated
sequences were involved in the somatic
rearrangements.8 These results suggest that
b-catenin deletion played an important role in
the early stage of tumorigenesis in the present
case. Abnormalities of b-catenin may play a
crucial role in the morphological features of
LSTs, as b-catenin is involved in cell adhesion.
It would be interesting to investigate the
frequency of b-catenin and APC alterations
in a number of LST cases.
Microsatellite instability (MSI) due to
defective DNA mismatch repair occurs in
the majority of hereditary non-polyposis
colorectal cancers (HNPCC) and in 10–15%
of sporadic colorectal cancers. It has been
reported that b-catenin mutations occur more
often in MSI positive colorectal cancers.9
However, tumor tissues in the present case
were MSI negative. Samowitz and collea￾gues10 reported that b-catenin exon 3 muta￾tions can be an early event in colorectal
tumorigenesis. However, Johnson and collea￾gues9 recently reported that b-catenin exon 3
mutations were rare in small (,1 cm)
sporadic adenomas (1/83, 1.2%), HNPCC
adenomas (1/37, 2.7%), and in both MSI
positive (0/34) and MSI negative (0/78)
sporadic colorectal cancers. In contrast, a
significantly increased frequency (8/44,
18.2%) was found in HNPCC cancers.9 The

Functional role of the 503F
variant of the organic cation
transporter OCTN1 in Crohn’s
disease
Several susceptible gene loci were identified
as being involved in the aetiology of Crohn’s
disease (CD).1 Recently, a non-synonymous
single nucleotide polymorphism in the
SLC22A4 gene encoding the organic cation
transporter OCTN1 has been linked with CD
in Caucasian populations (a 1672CT transver￾sion, resulting in the amino acid substitution
L503F).2 3 However, the functional conse￾quences of this alteration are unclear as yet.
We have now discovered that L-ergothio￾neine (ET, 2-mercaptohistidine trimethylbe￾taine), a naturally occurring water soluble
thiol compound of dietary origin, is the
physiological substrate of OCTN1.4 Analysis
of the concentration dependence of ET
transport in OCTN1 transfected HEK293
fibroblasts by liquid chromatography tandem
mass spectrometry revealed that the 503F
variant was associated with a threefold
higher substrate affinity (1/Km) and a two￾fold lower maximal transport velocity (Vmax),
which resulted in a 50% higher initial
transport capacity (Vmax/Km (503F) < 1.5 6
Vmax/Km (503L)) at low ET levels ((10 mmol/
l) (fig 1A). Analysis of the time course of ET
transport showed a higher clearance for the
503F variant (CL (503F) < 1.65 6CL (503L)
at an ET concentration of 10 mmol/l) (fig 1B).
ET transport by 503L and 503F was sodium

and pH dependent; only at unphysiologically
low Na+ and pH values were the differences
in transport activity between both variants
lost (fig 1C, D). Considering that maximal
levels of ET found in tissues and in common
foods are in the nanomolar to low micro￾molar range,5 our data suggest that carriers of
the 503F allele accumulate higher ET con￾centrations in OCTN1 expressing cells com￾pared with carriers of the wild-type 503L
allele. Therefore, high tissue levels of ET may
constitute a possible risk factor for CD.
The involvement of OCTN1 in the inflam￾matory process is further supported by obser￾vations that OCTN1 is strongly expressed in
intestinal epithelial and immunological cells,
particularly in CD14+ monocytes/macro￾phages playing a key role in the immuno￾pathogenesis of CD,6 as well as by the finding
that levels of SLC22A4 mRNA were upregu￾lated by proinflammatory cytokines such as
tumour necrosis factor a.
7 Moreover, we
found transcriptional regulation of SLC22A4
to determine essentially ET uptake: in CD14+
monocytes homozygous for the 503L variant,
expression levels of SLC22A4 mRNA showed
high interindividual heterogeneity and were
directly proportional to cellular ET content
(fig 1E). Accordingly, in CD4+ and CD8+
lymphocytes lacking OCTN1 expression, we
detected no ET (data not shown).
The physiological or pathophysiological
functions of ET are as yet unknown. We
tested the effect of ET on proliferation of the
colon cancer epithelial cell line Caco-2 that
was shown to be homozygous for the
susceptible 503F allele and to express high
levels of OCTN1 mRNA. Cell proliferation was
enhanced in a dose dependent manner after
exposure to ET concentrations above
20 mmol/l for 24 hours: at 200 mmol/l, pro￾liferation was increased to 120 (3)% of the
buffer control and intracellular ET concentra￾tion reached 6.7 (0.3) nmol/mg protein. In
contrast, no stimulation of proliferation was
seen when a Caco-2 variant without OCTN1
expression was employed; consequently, after
treatment with 200 mmol/l ET, only diffusion
controlled uptake to 0.67 (0.03) nmol/mg
protein occurred. When incubated with glut￾athione, both Caco-2 cell lines exhibited an
antioxidant typical inhibition of proliferation8
that was independent of OCTN1 expression
(fig 1F). Hence rather than antioxidant
activities, stimulatory effects on cell prolif￾eration appear to constitute the functional
role of ET. ET may accelerate the inflamma￾tory process by transcriptional activation of
fibroblast repair proliferation, thereby also
conferring susceptibility of CD patients to
develop colorectal cancer.9
Collectively, our data suggest that the
OCTN1 substrate ET is a proliferative factor
in inflammatory diseases such as CD, and
subjects carrying the 503F allele are at an
increased risk due to a higher intracellular
accumulation of ET.

Diarrhoea as a presentation of
bird flu infection: a summary on
its correlation to outcome in Thai
cases
Bird flu or avian flu, caused by H5N1 virus, is
a new emerging infectious disease. There has
been worldwide avian influenza infections in
poultry since 1997. Recently, H5N1 caused
severe disease with high mortality in humans
in Vietnam and Thailand.1 Most infected
cases usually developed progressive pneumo￾nia with acute respiratory distress syndrome
and consequently died. Atypical presenta￾tions of patients with bird flu were also
noted. de Jong et al recently reported a fatal
bird flu infected case in Vietnam with a
presentation of diarrhoea, without respira￾tory symptoms.2
I performed a mini-study in order to
document the magnitude of diarrhoeal pre￾sentation among reported Thai patients and
the correlation with outcome. A literature
review on papers concerning human bird flu
in Thailand was performed using databases
of published works cited in Index Medicus
and the Science Citation Index. I also
reviewed published works in all 256 local
Thai journals, which are not included in the
international citation index, for reports of
human bird flu infection in Thailand. Studies
that contained incomplete data were
excluded from further analysis.
Six reports3–8 of 12 Thai patients with a
confirmed diagnosis of bird flu were found.
Of 12 infected cases, respiratory symptoms
were seen in all cases and diarrhoea was
detected at presentation in five cases (41.7 %)
Considering the five diarrhoeal cases, acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was
detected in four cases and there were three
deaths. Concerning the seven non-diarrhoeal
cases, ARDS was detected in five cases and
there were five fatalities. There was no
significant correlation between presentation
of diarrhoea and development of ARDS
(p.0.05) or fatality (p.0.05) but there was
a significant correlation between the devel￾opment of ARDS and fatality (p = 0.001).
There are some reports of diarrhoea in
severe bird flu infection.2 Poovorawan recently
proposed that diarrhoea was an important
presentation of bird flu and could imply a poor
prognosis.9 Here, I attempted to assess the
magnitude of diarrhoea among Thai infected
cases and its correlation with infection out￾come. According to this study, the prevalence
of diarrhoeal presentation was high, similar to
a recent study in Vietnam (approximately
70%).10 I therefore conclude that diarrhoeal
presentation had a poor correlation with
outcome of infection among our subjects.

High levels of disease related

Disease related prion protein (PrPSc) is read￾ily detectable in lymphoreticular tissues in

not in other forms of human prion disease.1–5

concerns that secondary transmission of vCJD
prions will occur through a wide range of
surgical procedures.137 Risk assessment for
intestinal endoscopy, biopsy, and surgery is
currently limited by a lack of knowledge about
relative PrPSc levels and prion titres within
intestinal tissues in vCJD patients. Because of
its high content of lymphoid follicles, terminal
ileum is regarded as the intestinal tissue
having the highest potential for iatrogenic
transmission of vCJD prions.8 9 Here we
provide the first report of relative PrPSc
concentrations in vCJD terminal ileum.
Tissues were obtained at autopsy with
consent from relatives from four patients
with neuropathologically confirmed vCJD
and two patients with neuropathologically
confirmed sporadic CJD (both PRNP codon
129MM with type 2 PrPSc in brain). Terminal
ileum was analysed for PrPSc by high
sensitivity immunoblotting3 and for abnor￾mal PrP immunoreactivity by immunohisto￾chemistry.6 Using these methods, terminal
ileum from all four vCJD cases showed high
levels of detectable PrPSc (fig 1A). In three
vCJD cases, 2/2 homogenates prepared from
each ileum specimen were positive for PrPSc
whereas 2/4 ileum homogenates were posi￾tive in the other vCJD case. The glycoform
ratio of protease resistant fragments of di-,
mono-, and non-glycosylated PrP in terminal
ileum appeared to be closely similar to the
type 4t PrPSc pattern seen in vCJD tonsil.2 3
Although there was variation in PrPSc con￾centration between different homogenates of
vCJD terminal ileum, PrPSc levels in positive
samples were typically in the range 0.1–1% of
that present in vCJD brain (fig 1B). With
respect to both sampling variation and PrPSc
concentration, terminal ileum appears to be
closely similar to lymph nodes in vCJD.3
These findings, together with our previous
studies, show that PrPSc deposition within
the intestine is not uniform in vCJD. From
the four cases of vCJD with PrPSc positive
terminal ileum studied here, 0/2 cases with
available tissue had detectable PrPSc in the
appendix3 10 and only 1/3 cases had detectable
PrPSc in the rectum.3 In contrast with findings
with vCJD terminal ileum, no detectable PrPSc
was found in homogenates of terminal ileum
prepared from sporadic CJD patients (fig 1A).
The lack of detection of PrPSc in sporadic CJD
terminal ileum extends our previous findings
for one of these cases in which we have
previously reported a lack of detectable PrPSc
in tonsil, rectum, and appendix.3 10
In agreement with findings from immuno￾blotting, immunohistochemistry showed
abnormal PrP deposition in the terminal
ileum in vCJD (fig 1C) but not in sporadic
CJD (data not shown). The irregular distribu￾tion of abnormal PrP positive lymphoid
follicles seen in vCJD terminal ileum is
consistent with variation in PrPSc concentra￾tion detected in different terminal ileum
samples by immunoblotting.
Albeit from necessarily limited numbers
investigated, the uniform presence of PrPSc in
vCJD terminal ileum, at concentrations of up
to 1% of those found in vCJD brain,
reinforces concerns that iatrogenic transmis￾sion of vCJD prions might occur through
contaminated intestinal endoscopes, biopsy
forceps, or surgical instruments.3 7–10 These
findings should assist policy makers in the
UK and elsewhere in risk assessments about
the use of disposable forceps for intestinal
biopsy. Alternative approaches to risk reduc￾tion may now be possible as practical means
of prion decontamination for endoscopes and
surgical instruments are now feasible using
enzymatic methods.7 11

Chronic inflammatory intestinal
diseases and bone loss
We were very interested in the recent article
by Moschen et al on activation of the RANKL/
OPG system in inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD) (Gut 2005;54:479–87). Until recently,
osteoporosis secondary to gastrointestinal
diseases was mainly considered a direct
consequence of malabsorption.1 2 The article
of Moschen et al and a previous one of our
group on bone loss in coeliac disease,3 a
disorder similarly characterised by intestinal
inflammation, offer a new perspective on the
pathogenesis of bone loss and reveal a more
complex picture. Moschen et al demonstrated
overproduction of OPG in the cells of colonic
mucosa in IBD whereas Taranta and collea￾gues3 showed the direct role of the soluble
cytokines in the serum of coeliac patients on
bone cells. In fact, they found an increased
RANKL/OPG ratio in untreated coeliac
patients and different effects of the sera of
untreated coeliac patients with respect to
those on a gluten free diet, on cultured bone
cells. These effects included increased in vitro
osteoclastogenesis, and lower interleukin 18
and OPG expression in osteoblasts.
In both studies, these biochemical observa￾tions were translated in a reduction of bone
mass. Moschen et al found a negative correla￾tion between OPG plasma levels and spine and
femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD).
Taranta and colleagues3 observed a significant
negative correlation between BMD z score and
interleukin 6 levels and RANKL/OPG ratio. In
the discussion, Moschen et al observed that
‘‘studies of OPG/RANKL and BMD are
required to validate’’ his model.
We believe that our study may be a first
step towards understand, at least in part, the
relative contribution of inflammation to bone
loss in intestinal diseases. These results are
also in accordance with recent studies on
primary osteoporosis, which are beginning to
show a relevant role of local and systemic
factors on bone cell activity.4–6 Finally, these
studies may also open the way to different
therapeutic approaches—namely, drugs spe￾cifically acting on cytokines release and/or
activity—for bone loss secondary to ‘‘inflam￾matory intestinal diseases’’.

BOOK REVIEW
for further introduction to the scientific
literature.
The information is generally presented in a
refreshing and amicable style. I think the
book is friendly enough to be of benefit to an
average student, but at the same time it
caters adequately for the more seasoned
learner too. It features some beautiful pic￾tures and drawings depicting many indivi￾duals who have contributed to this field over
the last hundred or so years. I thought the
cartoons in the chapter on Helicobacter pylori
were particularly pleasing and informative.
I particularly liked the background to the
development of the first proton pump inhib￾itor (PPI). This I thought was thoroughly
stimulating and will no doubt enable me to
create a greater impression in front of the
next PPI rep that I meet. The chapter on
peptic ulcer disease is by and large par for the
course, but the section on Barrett’s oesopha￾gus presents a very logical and sensible
approach towards tackling an area which
remains controversial.
As a matter of personal taste, I would like
to have seen a few key messages or take
home points at the end of each chapter. These
can also act as a quick source of reference for
those who find that spare time is generally an
elusive commodity, which, I suspect, is nearly
all of us.
All in all, it is a timely and a creditable
addition covering a very important and
rapidly evolving field of gastroenterology
and the authors ought to be congratulated
for their efforts. Would I buy it? Probably yes,
but only if I did not have a copy of the first
edition. I would certainly recommend it as a
departmental book as, among its many
virtues, it provides useful titbits to amuse
the audience during presentations.

This textbook by Irvin Modlin and George
Sacks is a welcome addition to the increas￾ingly important and dynamic field of gastric
acid and related disorders. It is very well laid
out and provides quite a comprehensive
understanding of this field. Compared with
the first edition, this second edition has a few
additional sections, such as reports of studies
from knockout and transgenic animals,
which help keep the reader up to date.
It concentrates on cellular events with
great focus, and at the same time provides a
very enlightening and broad historical pro￾spective, although in the case of the latter
there is a touch of overdose at times. I found
the chapters on biology and pharmacology
particularly interesting. This acted as a useful
exercise in revision and brought back mem￾ories (mostly pleasant) from my medical
student days.
Each chapter is not separately referenced
although at the end of each chapter the
authors do provide a list of suggested reading
