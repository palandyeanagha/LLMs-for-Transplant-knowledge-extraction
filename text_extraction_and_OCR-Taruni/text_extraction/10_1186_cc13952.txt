Abstract
Introduction: Intravenous loop diuretics are a cornerstone of therapy in acutely decompensated heart failure
(ADHF). We sought to determine if there are any differences in clinical outcomes between intravenous bolus and
continuous infusion of loop diuretics.
Methods: Subjects with ADHF within 12 hours of hospital admission were randomly assigned to continuous
infusion or twice daily bolus therapy with furosemide. There were three co-primary endpoints assessed from
admission to discharge: the mean paired changes in serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR),
and reduction in B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). Secondary endpoints included the rate of acute kidney injury
(AKI), change in body weight and six months follow-up evaluation after discharge.
Results: A total of 43 received a continuous infusion and 39 were assigned to bolus treatment. At discharge, the
mean change in serum creatinine was higher (+0.8 ± 0.4 versus -0.8 ± 0.3 mg/dl P <0.01), and eGFR was lower
(-9 ± 7 versus +5 ± 6 ml/min/1.73 m2 P <0.05) in the continuous arm. There was no significant difference in the
degree of weight loss (-4.1 ± 1.9 versus -3.5 ± 2.4 kg P = 0.23). The continuous infusion arm had a greater reduction
in BNP over the hospital course, (-576 ± 655 versus -181 ± 527 pg/ml P = 0.02). The rates of AKI were comparable
(22% and 15% P = 0.3) between the two groups. There was more frequent use of hypertonic saline solutions for
hyponatremia (33% versus 18% P <0.01), intravenous dopamine infusions (35% versus 23% P = 0.02), and the hospital
length of stay was longer in the continuous infusion group (14. 3 ± 5 versus 11.5 ± 4 days, P <0.03). At 6 months there
were higher rates of re-admission or death in the continuous infusion group, 58% versus 23%, (P = 0.001) and this
mode of treatment independently associated with this outcome after adjusting for baseline and intermediate variables
(adjusted hazard ratio = 2.57, 95% confidence interval, 1.01 to 6.58 P = 0.04).
Conclusions: In the setting of ADHF, continuous infusion of loop diuretics resulted in greater reductions in BNP from
admission to discharge. However, this appeared to occur at the consequence of worsened renal filtration function, use
of additional treatment, and higher rates of rehospitalization or death at six months.

Introduction
The use of intravenous loop diuretics is a cornerstone of
therapy for acutely decompensated heart failure (ADHF)
treatment, especially in patients admitted with pulmonary
congestion and volume overload. Significant concerns have
been raised regarding the risks and benefits of loop di￾uretics, especially about the dosage and administration
regimen [1,2]. Recent guidelines recommend the use of
loop diuretics to reduce left ventricular filling pressure,
avoid pulmonary edema, and alleviate peripheral fluid re￾tention [3]. Therapeutic recommendations focus primarily
on symptom relief because there are no specific strategies
showing a clear benefit in the outcome of ADHF. Despite
the ubiquity of loop diuretic administration, high quality
data supporting their efficacy and best modality of admin￾istration are lacking. In addition, impaired renal function
has consistently been proven to be an independent risk
factor for adverse outcomes and a leading reason why
higher doses and continuous infusions are used. The use
of high doses of loop diuretics has been associated with
unfavorable neuroendocrine activation, worsening renal
function, electrolyte disturbances, and a poor outcome
[4,5]. Although loop diuretics are the most commonly
used drugs in ADHF treatment, their short- and long￾term effects are relatively unknown; thus, it is recom￾mended to administer the lowest dosage to patients with
ADHF in order to relieve their symptoms [5]. Some stud￾ies have provided guidelines for the administration of these
drugs in clinical practice, but data interpretation remains
challenging due to the frequent exclusion of patients with
kidney disease from major ADHF clinical trials. Therefore,
it is not clear if continuous infusion is better than inter￾mittent boluses in terms of decongestion, maintenance of
renal filtration function, and prognosis [6,7]. In theory,
intermittent boluses could lead to more unfavorable
hemodynamic changes, be associated with a higher rate of
diuretic resistance due to suboptimal drug levels in the
renal tubules, and result in a rebound in sodium reabsorp￾tion. On the other hand, continuous administration should
provide more constant delivery of diuretic into the tubule,
potentially reducing this phenomenon. Additionally, con￾tinuous infusion may induce an increased dieresis, reducing
systemic and pulmonary congestion more efficaciously,
thus avoiding sudden blood pressure reduction induced
by bolus administration. However, for the same reasons,
continuous infusion is associated with sustained neuroen￾docrine activation and electrolyte imbalance that could
potentially be reduced by intermittent administration.
The Diuretic Optimization Strategies Evaluation (DOSE)
trial was a prospective, double-blind study in which re￾searchers randomly assigned 308 subjects with ADHF
to high-dose versus low-dose and continuous versus
intermittent infusion of furosemide. This study did not
reveal positive outcomes in either primary or secondary
endpoints comparing continuous infusion to a bolus regi￾men. However, there were higher rates of acute kidney
injury (AKI) in the high-dose arm [8]. Thus, equipoise re￾mains on this issue. Our study aimed to evaluate the ef￾fects of continuous infusion of furosemide in comparison
with a twice daily regimen at similar doses, on biomarker
and clinical parameters.
Methods
Study design
This was a prospective, randomized, open label, double￾blind study comparing continuous with intermittent in￾fusion of furosemide in patients admitted with a diagno￾sis of ADHF into our tertiary-care medical center. The
current pilot study design was planned to anticipate a
larger multicenter trial able to definitively evaluate most
optimal loop diuretic strategies in patients with ADHF.
Patients were enrolled consecutively from the Depart￾ment of Internal Medicine, Cardiology Section Center
(Siena, Italy) from April 2010 to November 2012. All pa￾tients enrolled were submitted to continuous electrocar￾diography and blood pressure monitoring as well as
regular measurements of urine output. We hypothesized
that continuous infusion treatment could be superior to
bolus intermittent administration to relieve congestion,
increase diuresis and decrease B-type natriuretic peptide
(BNP) levels.
Patients were eligible if they were admitted with a pri￾mary diagnosis of ADHF, could be randomized within
12 h after hospital presentation and had evidence of
volume overload (pulmonary congestion on chest radi￾ography or significant increase in BNP levels). Some
patients received noninvasive ventilation support be￾fore randomization (10 in the continuous and 7 in the
bolus group). The cumulative daily dose of intravenous
furosemide to be given in the initial 12 h was decided
upon by the attending physician. Patients were then
randomized in a 1:1 ratio using a computer-generated
scheme into either twice-daily bolus injections or continu￾ous infusion (mixed as a 1:1 ratio in 5% dextrose in water),
for a time period ranging from 72 to 120 h. Boluses of fur￾osemide were administered in 100 ml of water solution in
one hour. The mean daily diuretic dosage was similar in
both groups as a result of the protocol (Figure 1).
Before randomization, renal function parameters and
BNP levels were measured in all patients. Therefore, all
patients were submitted to echocardiograpy and chest
radiography to assess pulmonary congestion. Chest radi￾ography was also repeated promptly before treatment
disruption to verify pulmonary congestion improvement.
Subsequent titration of the furosemide dosage was guided
by a dose-escalation algorithm based on the patient’s re￾sponse to the treatment (body weight (BW) loss <1 kg
from the starting enrollment to the third day or urine

output <1,000 mL/day), signs of recovery (decreased
pulmonary rales, venous jugular congestion, additive
heart sounds, improvement in pulmonary congestion on
chest radiography), and/or by important changes in renal
function, such as a sudden increase of creatinine >0.8 mg/dl
compared to the baseline value or hypokalemia below
3.2 mEq/L. The specific doses of furosemide and the use
of additional agents to manage ADHF (dopamine, intra￾venous (IV) vasodilators, hypertonic saline infusions for
hyponatremia) were decided upon based on the above
cited laboratory and clinical parameters, with daily dos￾ages adjusted during the infusion periods. Specifically in
the case of poor initial diuretic response, the furosemide
dosage was doubled. In case of diuretic resistance, defined
as diuresis below 1,000 mL/day, the dosage was escalated
up to 250 mg/day.
Supplementary treatment was left to the discretion of
the treating physician. All patients took angiotensin￾converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor
blockers and nitrates. No thiazide diuretics, nesiritide, or
arginine vasopressin antagonists were administered dur￾ing the hospitalization period. Hypertonic saline solution
was administered to the patients who developed hypona￾tremia (serum Na values <128 mEq/L) during treatment
with the goal of restoring plasma sodium values up to
134 mEq/L. For this reason Na concentration was moni￾tored each day during the infusion period. The hypertonic
saline solution consisted of 20 mEq of NaCl in 500 mL
saline solutions (0.9% of NaCl). Infusion was adminis￾tered at 80 cc/h once or twice a day, depending on the
Na value [9]. Dopamine infusions were administered to
patients with systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg with the
goal of restoring systolic values up to 100 mmHg main￾taining diuretic infusion. Inotrope therapy was stopped
when blood pressure values were sustained at approxi￾mately 105 mmHg during 12 sequential hours for four
consecutive measurements.
The frequency of laboratory tests to evaluate electrolyte
balance and renal function during hospitalization was at
the discretion of the attending physician but was guided
by a dose-escalation algorithm. This trial was approved by
our hospital’s Institutional Review Board of Siena and all
patients gave their signed informed consent. This trial was
registered and regularly updated in ClinicalTrials.gov with
Identifier number: NCT01441245.
Inclusion criteria
Patients over age 18 years of age were screened if they
met diagnostic criteria for ADHF due to systolic dysfunc￾tion and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <45% by
exhibiting at least one of the following symptoms at rest:
dyspnea, orthopnea, peripheral edema or major fatigue
and at least two clinical signs including rales, pulmonary
congestion on chest radiography, jugular vein dilatation,

or a third heart sound. Elevations in blood BNP >400 pg/mL
were considered supportive for a diagnosis of ADHF.
Exclusion criteria
Patients were excluded if they had received more than
two IV doses of furosemide or any continuous infusion
of furosemide one month before randomization, if they
had end-stage renal disease or the need for renal re￾placement therapy (dialysis or ultrafiltration), isolated
diastolic dysfunction with LVEF >45% or recent myocar￾dial infarction within thirty days of screening. Patients
with a systolic blood pressure <80 mm Hg or with serum
creatinine levels >4.0 mg/dL were also excluded, as well
as patients who received recent intravenous iodinated
contrast.
Laboratory analysis
Complete blood analysis with hemoglobin concentration,
hematocrit, red blood cell count, serum creatinine, so￾dium, and potassium were performed at the time of ad￾mission to determine the baseline criteria, and subsequent
testing was performed each day and again at the time
of discharge. The estimated glomerular filtration rate
(eGFR) was calculated using the four-variable formula,
modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD). Mild
kidney dysfunction was defined by eGFR less than
60 mL/min/1.73 m2
, and moderate kidney dysfunction as
eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2 based on chronic kidney
disease (CKD) stages. A rise in serum creatinine ≥0.3 mg/dl
or urine output <0.5 mL/kg/h × 6 h was used according
to conventional criteria to define AKI [10]. This meas￾urement was calculated from admission to the end of
diuretic infusion treatment. Plasma BNP was measured
at baseline and at the end of infusion period using an
immunofluorescence assay manufactured by Inverness
(San Diego, CA, USA). The analytic sensitivity of the
assay is <5 pg/mL and the upper limit of normal is con￾sidered to be <100 pg/mL.
In-hospital outcomes
The co-primary endpoints at discharge were the mean
paired changes in creatinine, eGFR, body weight (BW),
and BNP. Additional in-hospital outcomes assessed in￾cluded the rate of AKI, the use of hypertonic saline and
inotropic agents, and length of hospital stay.
Late outcomes
Death and rehospitalization because of worsening heart
failure were captured up to 6 months after discharge. If
the hospitalization was for heart-failure-related events
such as pump failure, acute coronary syndromes compli￾cated by heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias associated
with left ventricular dysfunction, or heart failure associ￾ated with worsened renal function, for analytical purposes
these were all considered as hospitalization for heart
failure.
Sample size estimation
The sample size used was preliminarily calculated on
the basis of three co-primary endpoints including the
following assumptions: 1) a 30% or greater effect size in
the difference between mean paired changes in con￾tinuous co-primary endpoints (eGFR, creatinine, and
BNP); SD data from each group no greater than 20%;
2) alpha = 0.05 two-tailed, 3) power (1-beta) = 80%. Thus,
the calculated sample size was 52 subjects (26 in each
group) and we assumed no patients would withdraw or be
lost during the hospitalization. We also anticipated that
20% of subjects could be lost to follow up after hospital
discharge.
Statistical analysis
All data were analyzed with intention-to-treat principles.
Continuous variables were expressed as mean ± SD and
compared using the Student t-test (unpaired and paired
as appropriate) for independent groups if normally dis￾tributed; normality was assessed by the Kolmogorov￾Smirnov test. Analysis of variance was done by Levene’s
test, and if it was breached Welch’s correction was used.
Cox regression analysis was used to assess the independ￾ent relationship between the two methods of furosemide
infusion for the outcome of rehospitalization or death,
with adjustment for age, gender, creatinine, eGFR, and
BNP at baseline, the use of hyperosmolar solution, dopa￾mine infusion, and the development of AKI. Kaplan￾Meier methods were employed to generate survival plots
that were compared using a log-rank test for time to
first hospitalization, death, or the composite. All statis￾tical tests were two-tailed, with a P-value <0.05 consid￾ered significant. All the analyses were performed by
using the SPSS 20.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago,
IL, USA).
Results
Baseline characteristics
A total of 128 patients were consecutively admitted and
screened with diagnosis of ADHF; of these patients 22
were excluded for preserved ejection fraction, 8 for re￾cent myocardial infarction, 8 for incomplete laboratory
assessments at baseline, and 6 for severe renal disease.
Of the 84 patients 2 were subsequently excluded because
of missing data (weight, and BNP). Thus, 82 patients
met the inclusion criteria and were randomly assigned
to one of the two groups: continuous infusion, n = 43 or
bolus therapy, n = 39 (Figure 1). The median time from
presentation to randomization was 9 ± 3 h, and the me￾dian duration of study-drug administration was 112 ±
24 h. Table 1 provides patient’ characteristics in each

group at the time of enrollment. The overall age was 72 ±
8 years, LVEF 35 ± 10%, serum creatinine 1.6 ± 0.5 mg/dl,
and plasma BNP level 1156 ± 640 pg/Ml, with no signifi￾cant differences between the randomized arms. The
mean cumulative daily doses of furosemide chosen by
the attending physicians were similar in both arms (con￾tinuous infusion: 170 ± 70 mg/day, bolus therapy 160 ±
80 mg/day).
Laboratory values and urine output
At the end of treatment period, continuous infusions re￾sulted in greater urine output (2295 ± 755 versus 2090 ±
421 mL, P <0.002); higher achieved serum creatinine
values (1.78 ± 0.6 versus 1.34 ± 0.3 mg/dl P <0.0001), lower
eGFR (40.6 ± 10.5 versus 50.4 ± 11.4 mL/min/1.73 m2
,
P <0.01), and higher blood urea nitrogen levels (100 ±
60 vs 69 ± 31 mg/dl, P <0.02). After the randomized
treatment period of approximately 120 hours, the mean
plasma BNP was lower in the continuous infusion arm
(723 ± 497 versus 822 ± 548 pg/Ml, P = 0.05). By hospital
discharge, there were lower potassium levels in the con￾tinuous arm (3.6 ± 0.8 versus 4.0 ± 0.7 mEq/L, P <0.04),
reductions from baseline (-0.5 ± 1.4 versus -0.3 ±
0.9 mEq/L), however there were no significant differences
in serum sodium (+1 ± 6 versus -3 ± 7 mEq/L) (Table 2).
Primary endpoints
The mean change in serum creatinine was higher
(+0.8 ± 0.4 versus -0.8 ± 0.3 mg/dl, P <0.01), and eGFR
lower (-9 ± 7 versus +5 ± 6 mL/min/1.73 m2
, P <0.05)
in the continuous infusion arm. However, the mean reduc￾tion in BNP concentration from baseline to discharge was
significantly greater with the continuous infusion compared
to the bolus infusion (-576 ± 655 versus -181 ± 527 pg/mL,
P = 0.02) (Table 3).
As for the secondary outcomes, the incidence of AKI
was similar (continuous arm 10 patients (22%) and bolus
arm 6 patients (15%) P = 0.3) for the two groups. There
was more frequent use of hypertonic saline solutions for
hyponatremia (33% versus 18%, P <0.01), intravenous
dopamine infusions (35% versus 23%, P = 0.02), and the
hospital length of stay was longer in the continuous in￾fusion group (14.3 ± 5 versus 11.5 ± 4 days, P <0.03)
(Table 4). There was no significant difference in the de￾gree of weight loss -4,1 ± 1,9 versus -3,5 ± 2,4 kg, p =
0.23. A total of 26 patients died (31%) and 35 (41%) had
a new hospitalization during follow up. At 6 months
there were higher rates of re-admission or death in the
continuous infusion group, with 58% versus 23%, P =
0.001 (Figure 2).

nitrogen (BUN) and randomization to continuous loop
diuretics were the only baseline variables that were signifi￾cantly associated with poor outcome. Additionally, serum
creatinine, eGFR, and plasma BNP after the randomized
treatment period (approximately 120 h) were associated
with rehospitalization or death as shown in Table 5. When
these variables were tested in a Cox proportional hazards
model which included age, gender, baseline creatinine,
eGFR, BUN and BNP, use of hyperosmolar solutions,
dopamine infusions, eGFR after the treatment period, and
the development of AKI, only randomization to continu￾ous infusion (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.57, 95% CI 1.01, 6.58,
P = 0.04), and after the treatment period (approximately
120 h) the serum creatinine above 1.5 mg/dl, (HR = 6.40,
95% CI 1.25, 32.62, P = 0.02), and BNP above 500 pg/mL,
(HR = 1.01, 95% CI 1.00, 1.02, P = 0.04), remained signifi￾cantly associated with rehospitalization or death.
The Kaplan-Meier curve showed that in continuous
arm there was an increased events rate during the 180-day
observational period after discharge (Figure 3).
Discussion
Loop diuretic therapy is considered the cornerstone for
heart failure (HF) management, particularly during epi￾sodes of acute decompensation. More than 90% of patients
admitted for HF are treated with this drug [2,3]. Although
mentioned in guidelines for ADHF, there is little evidence
to support a preferred dose, route of administration, or
method of intravenous infusion [6,11]. Furthermore,
observational studies have demonstrated that higher
cumulative doses of loop diuretics have been associ￾ated with worsened outcomes [12,13]. Thus, our trial
had an excellent setting to allow clinicians to choose a
cumulative daily dose of diuretics and then randomize
patients to a continuous versus bolus administration of
loop diuretics.
Continuous versus intermittent loop diuretic
administration
We found a few clinical advantages to the use of continu￾ously infused loop diuretics in that there appeared to be a
greater urine output after 24 h and a greater reduction in
BNP after approximately 5 days. All other clinical factors
favored the use of intermittent twice daily bolus adminis￾tration including the change in serum creatinine, eGFR,
need for the use of hypertonic saline for hyponatremia,
use of inotropic agents, length of hospital stay, and rehos￾pitalization or death at 6 months.
Importantly, after we adjusted for intermediate out￾comes and physician responses to clinical changes, we
found that randomization to continuous infusion ther￾apy was strongly associated with rehospitalization and
death at 6 months. The power of this evaluation is low
due to low numbers of subjects Thus, despite any theor￾etical advantages of continuous administration, we found
no clinical benefit; in fact there was evidence of harm
with this approach. All of these effects related either to
greater diuresis or preexisting undocumented morbidity
would be expected to worsen outcomes. Our findings re￾vealed a bimodal effect of continuous infusion: despite a
significant decrease in BNP levels we found an increase
of eGFR and creatinine, such a trend seems to reflect
the late outcome. The current course should evidence
the prognostic impact of AKI compared to BNP reduc￾tion during hospitalization could have more unfavorable
impact in our population. Findings of multivariate ana￾lysis appear in line with the current observation: both
BNP and creatinine at discharge revealed a prognostic
impact, although creatinine together with type of treat￾ment, provide evidence of a more significant value. More￾over, patients in the continuous infusion arm were more

have biased the outcome findings.
Pharmacology of loop diuretics
In patients with ADHF treated with loop diuretics,
compensatory pathophysiologic mechanisms to main￾tain vascular resistance, such as nonosmotic stimulation
of vasopressin secretion and activation of the renin￾angiotensin system, have been observed. Because intra￾venous loop diuretics, as observed in our study, result in
an initial high-volume diuresis, the plasma refill of fluid
from the extravascular space may be exceeded by early
volume depletion, and thus create a risk for AKI [14].
Additionally, loop diuretics may directly impair renal
function by reducing renal blood flow resulting in redistri￾bution within the kidney and inducing a reduction in the
effective filtration fraction [7,15]. More recent analyses,
however, suggest that aggressive use of diuretics may be
necessary in severe cases and that adverse effects may re￾sult from disease severity [16,17]. Thus, we recognize that
in ADHF, higher doses of intravenous loop diuretics may
be unavoidable, therefore, the remaining issue is how best
to administer the therapy. In theory, continuous adminis￾tration could be associated with higher drug concentra￾tions at the loop of Henle, reducing energy requirements
of the cells at the medullary level and consequently provid￾ing protection during hypoxic states. All these mechanisms
lead to a resting state and a decrease in tubuloglomerular
feedback. Therefore, a continuous modality should provide
more constant urine output, less variation of intravascular
volume, and less sodium reabsorption. These beneficial ef￾fects must be weighed against more sustained neuroendo￾crine activation, greater counter-regulatory attempts to
increase sodium and water reabsorption, and efferent
arteriole vasoconstriction for a prolonged period of time
[15,17]. A recent Cochrane analysis was consistent with
this rationale by demonstrating that continuous infusions
ultimately resulted in lower urine outputs and greater rates
of adverse events; unfortunately, no data were reported on
long-term mortality or post-discharge events [18].
Reduction in renal filtration, B-type natriuretic peptide,
and outcomes
We found that larger volumes of diuresis were associated
with greater elevations in serum creatinine suggesting that
the rate of salt and water loss exceeded that of plasma re￾fill from the extra vascular compartment. A very similar
observation was made in the Evaluation Study of Congest￾ive Heart Failure and Pulmonary Artery Catheterization
Effectiveness (ESCAPE) trial [19]. We found that despite
greater reductions in BNP, there was worsened renal filtra￾tion function and no change in body weight. Studies have
demonstrated that reductions in BNP are in general asso￾ciated with improved short- and longer-term clinical out￾comes, particularly when the reduction is more than 30%
respect to admission level [20-22]. We found the differen￾tial reduction in BNP between the two groups was modest,

and there was a wide range of BNP levels both before and
after treatment. We observed a bimodal laboratory trend
in the two arms: the continuous arm showed greater diur￾esis with better BNP reduction, Intermittent administra￾tion revealed less worsening renal function and less need
for additive therapy. Thus, BNP is a single clinical param￾eter co-dependent on many variables related to left ven￾tricular wall tension, degree of neurohormonal activation,
and renal filtration function [23-25]. While many studies
have focused on baseline values at the time of admission,
we found that serum creatinine and BNP after the first
5 days of hospitalization was more significantly associated
with 6-month outcomes [26-28]. Thus, our data suggest
that in a clinical trial setting, the reduction in BNP does
not appear to be a surrogate for improved renal or clinical
outcomes in patients with ADHF, whereas basing of our
finding, worsening renal function during hospitalization
as well as basal renal dysfunction are two parameters
that deserve better attention in clinical practice.
Previous management studies
The DOSE trial provided important information in de￾termining the best method of administration of diuretics
in this setting. Our results are partly in accordance with
the DOSE trial which did not find superiority in either
the dose (high versus low) or administration (infusion
versus bolus) arms of a two-by-two factorial study [8].
Like DOSE, our trial found that continuous infusions at
higher doses tended to result in a greater incidence of
AKI. Our trial differed from DOSE in that our patients
had greater degrees of baseline renal impairment, the
loop diuretics were given for longer durations under the
study protocol, and importantly, we found that the con￾tinuous infusion was associated with the need for more
in-hospital therapies (inotropic infusions for hypotension
and hypertonic saline for hyponatremia). This probably
justifies a longer in-hospital stay together with worst
basal conditions and older age; in respect to the DOSE
trial patients moreover, most of them had comorbidities
(as renal insufficiency anemic status and pulmonary dis￾ease). In addition, we found higher rates of rehospitaliza￾tion and death in the continuous infusion arm. We did
not evaluate symptom relief as in the DOSE trial, thus,
there may have been a short-term differential strategy
that we missed with our design. We preferred to use la￾boratory parameters and the endpoint of urine output
because the symptom-stair is often misleading and does
not perfectly reflect the congestion status and effective
clinical improvement. Therefore the endpoints consid￾ered were demonstrated to have an effective impact on
early outcome. Finally they may permit better tailoring
of the dosing regimen for each patient during protocol
escalation, avoiding the side effects of therapy. Other
smaller studies comparing either dose or administration
therapy have not yielded important conclusions beyond
what can be reached from our trial or the DOSE trial,
thus, additional research on optimal, inpatient treatment
strategies is warranted in ADHF as well as in acute car￾diorenal syndrome [18,29-32].
Limitations
Our trial has all the limitations of small, single-center
randomized, pilot trials; however, except for the DOSE
HF trial it is the largest study comparing the modality
of loop diuretic administration in the acute HF setting. As
a practical consideration in management, we had the at￾tending physicians choose the cumulative daily dose of loop
diuretic based on their judgment, and the randomization
dictated the method of infusion, thus, treatment bias on
dose as well as dose adjustments was not completely

bolus loop diuretics (broken line).

handled in the protocol. Furthermore, we did not use a
double-dummy design to blind the method of infusion.
We did not have statistical power to evaluate differences
in clinical outcomes during the hospitalization or at
6 months follow up. The multivariate analysis, including
several risk factors and comorbidities, should be inter￾preted with caution because of the relativey small sam￾ple size. As in most randomized trials of ADHF, we did
not change the background therapy in the protocol,
thus, there was inherent non-uniform standard therapy
(that is, nitrate, ACE-inhibitors, beta-blockers). As one
of the outcomes, renal filtration function was calculated
by the MDRD formula, which could have been influ￾enced by several variables; the gold-standard calculation
would be the direct measurement of creatinine clear￾ance, which was not done in our study. Our findings
arise from a pilot study that needs to be confirmed in
large sample size, and for this reason we are pursuing
the enrollment, and we intend to enlarge our protocol
for a multicenter trial. We did not measure novel bio￾markers, assess urinary sodium, or perform other assays
that would have helped us in understanding why con￾tinuous infusions led to greater reductions in eGFR and
worsened outcomes. Finally, our findings cannot be ex￾tended to patients with newly diagnosed HF or to those
with lower diuretic requirements or perhaps better
baseline renal function, where the response to diuretic
strategies may be different.
Conclusions
Continuous infusions of loop diuretics in patients with
ADHF appear to provide more efficient diuresis, together
with better reduction of BNP levels in comparison with
bolus therapy during the in-hospital period. However, this
approach is associated with greater reductions in eGFR,
needing of additional therapy for hypotension and hypo￾natremia, and longer hospitalization. These events appear
to translate into higher rates of rehospitalization and death
at 180 days. A larger multicenter study utilizing a more
sophisticated assessment of volume overload and conges￾tion, measurement of plasma refill from the extravascular
compartment, and novel markers of both renal function
and damage is needed to further understand how loop
diuretics affect impact patients with ADHF and their
short- and longer-term clinical outcomes. It is possible that
degrees of physiologic tailoring of diuretic dose and admin￾istration are the next testable hypotheses in randomized
trials that aim to improve outcomes in this population.
Key messages
 Continuous infusion of loop diuretics is associated
with greater urine output and greater reduction in
BNP in respect to intermittent infusion during
hospitalization in patients with ADHF
 In this population continuous infusion of loop
diuretics is associated with an increased rate of AKI
before discharge
 An increased use of additional therapy has been
observed in the continuous infusion arm because of
increased rates of hypotension and hyponatremia
 An increased rate of worsened renal function in the
continuous arm appears related to impaired long-term
outcome in patients with ADHF
 A larger multicenter study utilizing a more tailored
diuretic dose and administration could clarify this
bimodal trend
