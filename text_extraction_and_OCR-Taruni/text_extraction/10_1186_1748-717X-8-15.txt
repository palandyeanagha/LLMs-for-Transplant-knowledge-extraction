Abstract
Background: We want to evaluate the efficacy of helical tomotherapy (HT) for treating advanced hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) with portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT).
Methods: We treated 35 patients for unresectable HCC combined with PVTT in whom other treatment modalities
were not indicated. The tumor thrombi involved the main trunk of the portal vein in 18 patients (51.4%) and the
first or second order branches in 17 patients (48.6%). A median dose of 50 Gy (range: 45–60 Gy) was delivered in 10
fractions. Capecitabine was given concomitantly at a dose of 600 mg/m2 twice daily during radiotherapy.
Results: The responses were evaluated via computed tomography. There was a complete response (CR) in 5
patients (14.3%), partial response (PR) in 10 patients (28.6%), stable disease (SD) in 18 patients (51.4%) and
progressive disease (PD) in 2 patients (5.7%). The Child-Pugh classification (A vs B) and the Japan integrated staging
(JIS) score (2 vs 3) were statistically significant parameters that predicted the response of PVTT (p = 0.010 and p =
0.026, respectively). The median survival, one and two year survival rate of all patients was 12.9 months, 51.4% and
22.2%, respectively. The patients with tumor thrombi in the main portal trunk showed statistically inferior overall
survival than patients with tumor thrombi in the portal vein branches (9.8 versus 16.6 months, respectively, p =
0.036). The responders’ median survival was 13.9 months, double 6.9 months as the median survival of the non￾responders. No radiation induced liver disease or treatment related mortality was not appeared.
Conclusions: Hypofractionated radiotherapy with HT was effective not only for tumor response but also for survival
in the advanced HCC patients with PVTT. And stricter patient selection by Child-Pugh classification and JIS score
may maximize the potential benefits of this treatment.

Background
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common contribu￾tor to the cancer incidence and mortality worldwide,
and particularly prevalent in East Asia and Africa where
hepatitis B and C viral infection is widespread [1].
Locally advanced HCC frequently invades the intrahepa￾tic vasculature and it commonly affects the portal vein.
The incidence of portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT)
is 44–62.8% in all HCC patients according to the aut￾opsy data [2,3] and 31.4-34% according to the clinical
data [4,5]. PVTT causes serious problems such as the
intrahepatic tumor spread, liver function deterioration
and portal vein hypertension and this all leads to intract￾able ascites, variceal rupture, hepatic encephalopathy
and/or death [3].
There are few options to choose for appropriately
treating HCC with PVTT. Surgical resection and liver
transplantation are limited to a highly selected group of
patients who have a good hepatic reserve and a small
primary tumor. Transcatheter arterial chemoemboliza￾tion (TACE) is a widely used treatment for HCC, but it
has a lack of efficacy and a high risk of ischemic liver in￾sufficiency when it is performed in patients with PVTT.
Various combinations of intraarterial and systemic

chemotherapeutic agents have recently been tried in
selected patients. However, when performing hepatic
intraarterial chemotherapy (HAIC), technical caution is
needed to maintain the function of the indwelling cath￾eter and the drug delivery system [6]. So, it is very chal￾lenging to treat advanced HCC patients with PVTT. The
role of radiotherapy has been gradually expanded from a
palliative intent to a curative intent in HCC patients.
With the advances in radiotherapy techniques, precise
delivery of higher ablative doses is now possible while
minimizing the doses to the surrounding normal organs.
Therefore, higher tumorcidal dose can be delivered to
the target even in the relatively large sized tumor during
shorter period than conventional treatment without in￾crease of normal tissue damage.
We have treated HCC patients with PVTT by using
helical tomotherapy (HT; Hi-Art system; Accuray,
Sunnyvale, CA), and this is capable of intensity modula￾tion as well as imaging guidance. This study reviews our
experience using HT plus concurrent capecitabine for
HCC patients with PVTT. We evaluated the efficacy and
safety of this treatment scheme and analyzed which
group of patients might stand to benefit from HT.
Methods
Patients
This study included 35 patients diagnosed with at Incheon St.
Mary’s Hospital (Incheon, Korea) from February 2006 to April
2010. The diagnosis of HCC was either histologically based
(n = 3) or made by the radiographic findings and/or an ele￾vated serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) value, with including the
presence of risk factors like hepatitis B or C viral infection and
underlying liver cirrhosis (n = 32). The presence of PVTT was
confirmed by at least two image studies, including contrast
enhanced dynamic computed tomography (CT) scans, dy￾namic enhanced magnetic resonance image or angiograms.
Our inclusion criteria were age > 18 years old, tumor
thrombosis in main, 1st or 2nd order branch of portal
vein, 3 or less Japanese Integrating Staging (JIS) score,
Child-Pugh class A or B, no extrahepatic metastasis and
refractory or progressive disease after previous treatment
before radiotherapy. We excluded five patients including
one patient with Child-Pugh class C and four patients
with extrahepatic metastasis from this analysis among
the total treated patients (n = 40) because the patients
were treated with palliative aim not definitive aim and
the number of the patients was too small to analyze.
Written informed consent was obtained from all the
patients and our Institutional Review Board approved
the review of the patients’ data.
Treatment
For simulation and treatment, the patient was trained to
breathe shallowly. When performing simulation with
contrast enhanced liver dynamic CT, custom made
double vacuum system (BodyFixW, Medical Intelligence,
GmbH, Schwabmunchen, Germany) was used for
immobilization and abdominal dampening. Two add￾itional series of CT scans during inspiration and expir￾ation were obtained to track the motion of the tumors
and other internal organs. The simulation CT images
were then transferred to the Pinnacle (v 8.0) planning
station (Philips Medical Systems, Andover, MA). The
gross tumor volume (GTV) of PVTT with or without
intrahepatic tumor was contoured on the portal phase
CT. The entire main hepatic tumor was included in the
GTV with physician’s decision considering the patient’s
liver function, tumor size and the irradiated volume of
liver. The internal target volume (ITV) was defined as
the summation of the GTVs on the inspiratory and ex￾piratory CT images, and the planning target volume
(PTV) was defined with a 1 cm margin around the ITV.
The organs at risk (OARs) were the liver, lungs, kidneys,
spinal cord, heart, spleen, esophagus, stomach, duode￾num and small bowels. Treatment planning was per￾formed using Tomotherapy planning software (Accuray,
Sunnyvale, CA) after obtaining the images and contours
from the Pinnacle system.
The tumor dose was prescribed to the 95% isodose line
encompassing the PTV. For dose constraints for OAR, the
dose volumetric parameters were calculated on the basis of
the dose-volume histogram (DVH) and they were con￾verted to the equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions. The mean
liver dose and V30 (Vn, the percentage of volume receiving
more than n Gy) of the liver were kept less than 28 Gy and
40%, respectively. The volume receiving > 50 Gy was lim￾ited to < 1 cc for the stomach and duodenum. The max￾imal dose was kept below 50 Gy for the spinal cord. The
mean dose to each side of kidney was kept below 23 Gy.
Before each treatment, we performed a megavoltage CT
(MVCT) scan on the tomotherapy unit. The displacement
of tumors and internal organs from their original position
on the simulation CT was automatically or manually cor￾rected for three axes (x, y and z) and rotation. However,
because MVCT could not show the exact outline of HCC,
our landmark of image guidance were bony structure such
as spine and rib, outline of liver and porta hepatis. After
the corrections, we confirmed that the 95% isodose line
encompassed all the tumor volumes on the MVCT and
then performed the treatment. Total dose was median
50 Gy (range, 45–60 Gy) in 10 fractions during 2 weeks.
The total dose translated to a biologic effective dose
(BED) was a median of 75 Gy10 (range: 65.3-96 Gy10) with
the α/β ratio = 10.
HT was delivered once per day, 5 times a week.
Chemotherapy with capecitabine (Xeloda; Roche, Nutley,
NJ) was administered concomitantly with radiotherapy
at a dose of 600 mg/m2 twice daily during radiotherapy.

Follow-up and response evaluation
Physicians evaluated the patients weekly during the
treatment, and this included physical examination and
the appropriate blood tests. After treatment, patients
were evaluated at 2 weeks and 1, 3 and 6 months after
radiotherapy and then every 3 months thereafter.
The response of PVTT was evaluated by CT scans and
assessing the tumor markers at 1 month after completion
of treatment, and then every 2 or 3 months thereafter. The
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST)
was used to determine the response of tumor. A complete
response (CR) was defined as a complete disappearance of
PVTT. Partial response (PR) was defined as at least a 30%
decrease of thrombus in the longest diameter. Progressive
disease (PD) was defined as at least a 20% increase of
PVTT in the longest diameter, and stable disease (SD) was
defined as a neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR
nor a sufficient increase to qualify for PD. The tumor mar￾ker response was also evaluated in patients whom the
serum AFP level was elevated above the normal range be￾fore tomotherapy. According to the percentage of change
compared with the pretreatment level, the AFP response
was categorized into a CR (normalization of the AFP level),
PR (more than a 50% reduction of the AFP level), PD
(more than a 25% increase of the AFP level) and SD (the
status met neither PR nor PD).
Treatment related toxicity was evaluated weekly dur￾ing treatment and at each follow-up visit after treatment.
Late toxicity was defined as toxicity occurring 3 months
after the completion of treatment. Radiation induced
liver disease (RILD) was defined as the development of
nonmalignant ascites without disease progression and an
anicteric increase in the alkaline phosphatase level of at
least two-fold or in the transaminase level of at least
five-fold after radiotherapy [7]. The gastrointestinal tox￾icity and hematologic toxicity were assessed using Radi￾ation Therapy Oncology Group toxicity criteria [8].
Statistical analysis
To evaluate the association between PVTT response and
various parameters, chi-square test, Fisher’s exact test, or
t-test were used. The patients’ overall survival (OS) was
defined as the duration from the start of radiotherapy to
the date of death or last follow-up and was calculated
from Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test was
used to compare the effect of each variable on the survival.
Statistical significance was set at p-values < 0.05.
Results
The patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. The
median age of the patients was 50 years (range: 40–
70 years). The Child-Pugh class was A in 28 patients
(80%) and B in 7 patients (20%). Tumor thrombi
involved the main trunk of the portal vein in 18 patients
(51.4%) and the first or second order branches in 17
patients (48.6%). Thirty patients received median 2 cycles
of TACE (range, 1–10 cycles) and one patient underwent
percutaneous ethanol injection and high intensity fo￾cused ultrasound for the treatment of HCC, but all of
them experienced no response or disease progression.
For the other 4 patients, HT was performed as the first
treatment because other treatment modalities were not
indicated. In 24 of 35 patients, median 2 cycles (range,
1–6) of further TACE was performed after HT because
they got the restoration of portal vein patency or had
multiple HCC to treat.
Median follow up time was 12.9 months (range, 2.9 –
56.6 months). The response of PVTT was evaluable for all
the patients. There was a CR in 5 patients (14.3%), PR in
10 patients (28.6%), SD in 18 patients (51.4%) and PD in 2
patients (5.7%). The objective response rate (CR + PR)
was 42.9%. Figure 1 shows the case of a patient who
achieved a CR of the PVTT. Table 2 showed the relation
of the various parameters between responders (CR + PR)

and non-responders (SD + PD). Child-Pugh classification
and JIS score were statistically significant parameters that
predicted the response of PVTT (p = 0.010 and p = 0.026,
respectively).
In 23 patients, intrahepatic tumor was treated with
PVTT simultaneously by physician’s decision. The treat￾ment response of intrahepatic tumor was also evaluated.
There was PR in 12 patients (52.2%), SD in 8 patients
and PD in 3 patients.
Of the 25 patients who had elevated AFP levels before
radiotherapy, the response of the AFP was evaluable in
24 patients. Seventeen patients (70.8%) achieved PR
according to the AFP level. Three patients (12.5%)
showed SD. Four patients (16.7%) had progression of the
serum AFP level.
At the time of analysis, 33 patients had died and 2
patients were alive. The OS duration for all the patients
was a median of 12.9 months (range: 2.9 – 56.6 months).
The OS curve for all the patients is presented in
Figure 2A. One-year OS rate was 51.4 ± 8.5% and 2-year
OS rate was 22.2 ± 7.1%, respectively.
For the treatment responders, the median survival dur￾ation was 13.9 ± 1.1 months, double 6.9 ± 5.1 months as
the median survival duration of the non-responder, yet
statically significant difference was not noted (p = 0.142)
(Figure 2B).
On the log-rank test, the involvement of the main por￾tal trunk was a significant unfavorable prognostic factor
for OS. Patients with PVTT which involved main portal
trunk survived 9.8 ± 4.2 months and patients whose
PVTT involved first or second order portal vein
branches survived 16.6 ± 5.9 months (p = 0.036). Table 3
summarized the univariate analyses for the OS.
The treatment-related toxicities are presented in
Table 4. The acute hematologic or gastrointestinal toxi￾cities were transient. In terms of liver complications, no
apparent RILD was observed according to the previously
defined criteria. From one to 3 months after the comple￾tion of radiotherapy, analysis of the liver function using
the Child-Pugh classification showed no change in class
in 23 patients. Twelve patients experienced the Child￾Pugh classification deterioration with 10 patients deteri￾orating from A to B and 2 patients deteriorating from B
to C. Among them, 2 patients experienced local tumor
progression and 2 patients had progression of distant
metastasis. No Hand-foot syndrome related to capecita￾bine appeared.
Late gastrointestinal toxicity appeared in 2 patients.
One patient experienced a duodenal ulcer bleeding and
this corresponded to grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicity at
5 months after radiotherapy. He received blood transfu￾sion and endoscopic argon ablation therapy. The other
patient was diagnosed with duodenal ulcer at 7 month
after radiotherapy and managed with proton pump

inhibitor. But after 1 month, a small perforation devel￾oped in the duodenal ulcer area and this resulted in
grade 4 gastrointestinal toxicity. The site of the perfor￾ation was successfully sealed with histoacryl and lipiodol
by endoscopic injection.
Discussion
Considering that almost HCC patients with PVTT have
a poor hepatic reserve associated with decreased portal
blood flow and underlying liver cirrhosis, preservation
or restoration of liver function is as important for their
prognosis as the achievement of tumor control. With
the advances of 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy
(3D-CRT), it is possible to minimize the irradiation of
the normal liver with increasing the tumor dose. Promis￾ing results have been reported by dose escalation studies
for small HCCs [9]. Similarly, in HCC patients with ac￾companying PVTT, the response rate (CR + PR) was
improved to 39–45.8% with increasing the total dose in
recent retrospective series of 3D-CRT. BED over
58 Gy10 was a significant predictor for tumor response
and overall survival [10,11]. So, we have tried to pre￾scribe the dose as high as possible because dose
response relationship was noted for HCCs with or with￾out PVTT [9-11].
With the advent of intensity modulated radiotherapy
(IMRT), capable of generating complex spatial dose dis￾tributions, high dose of radiation can be more safely fo￾cused to the target. HT has facilitated dedicated IMRT
delivery because of the continuously rotating 6-MV lin￾ear accelerator with a dynamically positioned multileaf
collimator every 7 degrees around the patient. A further
advantage of the tomotherapy unit is to minimize the set
up errors by the MVCT guidance. With HT, treating an
entire huge HCC or simultaneous irradiation of multiple
targets can be safely performed with sparing the normal
OARs [12,13].
There is currently little published data on treating
HCC patients who have PVTT with the recent advanced
radiation techniques. McIntosh et al. reported on the
treatment outcomes with HT plus concurrent capecita￾bine for 20 unresectable HCC patients. The HCC was
accompanied by PVTT in 8 of the patients. The total
dose was 50 Gy in 20 fractions. A PR or SD by the
RECIST was achieved in 15 of the 16 evaluable patients.
The response of 8 patients who have PVTT was not

evaluated separately [14]. Choi et al. performed stereo￾tactic body radiation therapy using Cyberknife in 9 HCC
patients whose target volume was only PVTT. The total
dose was 30–36 Gy in 3 fractions. The response rate of
the PVTT was CR in 1 patient (11.1%) and PR in 3
patients (33.3%) by the WHO criteria, but the sample
size was too small [15]. In the present study, the

objective response of the PVTT was CR in 5 patients
(14.3%), PR in 10 patients (28.6%), SD in 18 patients
(51.4%) by the RECIST criteria. Unfortunately, precise
comparison between recently published studies and this
study was impossible because of different criteria of pa￾tient selection and dose schedule of radiotherapy. How￾ever, although this study included a larger proportion of
patients with poor prognostic factors including Child￾Pugh class B and ECOG scale 2, it showed promising
results in the response rate and overall survival similar
or superior to previously published studies in which the
authors reported median overall survival time from 9 to
10 months [10,11]. Table 5 summarized the treatment
outcomes of studies which used radiotherapy for HCC
patients with PVTT. We prescribed high tumorcidal
dose using hypofractionated schedule with a large frac￾tion size during short course of radiotherapy. Moreover,
it may be valuable for HCC patients with PVTT when
considering their limited life expectancy. After careful
investigating our results, we found that the patients’ re￾sponse rates were similar between the patients with
ECOG scale one and two (8/18 vs. 7/17) and the respon￾ders tended to survive longer than non-responders. In
addition, the median survival time even in the patients
with ECOG scale 2 was 9.8 months and this was similar
as the patients with good performance status treated
with 3DCRT in the other studies [10,11]. In general, it
takes 5 to 6 weeks to treat the patients with HCC ac￾companying PVTT using 3DCRT, on the other hand,
our treatment duration using hypofractionated radio￾therapy with HT was only 2 weeks and this treatment
could be easily performed even in the patients with ECOG
scale 2. Thus, we may guess that even the patients with
ECOG scale 2 if they achieved good response after treat￾ment can survive longer than we supposed. However,
because there was no statistical significance, proceeding
trials should be required to make it certain.
A combination scheme of radiotherapy and systemic
therapy might be beneficial for locally advanced HCC
patients because they often present with multiple intra￾hepatic or disseminated extrahepatic diseases even at the
initial presentation, or they quickly experience a growth
of the intra or extrahepatic metastasis out of the radi￾ation field after radiotherapy. Improved treatment out￾comes with a combination of radiotherapy and systemic
therapy were reported by a series of 3D-CRT. In the
pilot study of localized chemoradiation therapy from
South Korea, Han et al. reported a superior outcome in
advanced HCC with PVTT. They treated the patients
with 3D-CRT and HAIC with 5-fluorouracil for Child￾Pugh class A patients. The median survival time and
3 year survival rate were 13.1 months and 24.1%, re￾spectively. The response rate after treatment was 45%
and the responders demonstrated better survival than
the non-responders (median survival, 19.9 months vs.
11.4 months, respectively, p = 0.033) [6]. The treatment
result of their study was superior long term survival to
our study. However, they included only patients with
Child-Pugh class A and the proportion of patients with
main portal trunk invasion was limited to 32.5% [6]. On
the other hand, our study included the patients with
Child-Pugh class B (20%) and the proportion of main
portal trunk invasion was 51.4%. As a concurrent
chemotherapeutic regimen, the present study used cape￾citabine, which has both a systemic effects and radiosen￾sitization. The patients well tolerated the concurrent
chemoradiation and the chemotherapy-related acute
toxicities were mild and transient.
As for staging, we choose the JIS system that integrates
both liver function and tumor-node-metastasis staging by

the Liver Cancer Study Group of Japan. The discriminatory
value of JIS system is more noted among the intermediate￾and advanced-stage HCC patients when compared with
other staging systems such as Okuda classification or CLIP
scoring for HCCs [16]. As most HCC patients with PVTT
have far advanced staging scores, JIS system might identify
the subgroup of patients who could be benefited from short
course high dose radiotherapy that was noted in this study.
Actually, we found only one responder after hypofractionated
radiotherapy using HT among the patients with JIS score 3.
Through the DVH analysis of the 3D-CRT series, the hep￾atic toxicity following radiotherapy could be correlated with
several dosimetric parameters. The mean liver dose, the V30
or the V50% (Vn%: the percentage of the liver volume re￾ceiving more than n% of the isocenter dose) and the normal
tissue complication probability (NTCP) are widely accepted
to be predictive of RILD [17,18]. While delivering a tumorci￾dal dose for tumor control, the advanced RT techniques is
expected to decrease the incidence of RILD. Cheng et al.
compared the differences of the dose-volume data between
3D-CRT and IMRT for HCC patients. They found that
IMRT could significantly reduce the NTCP (23.7% vs.
36.6%, respectively, p = 0.009), but significantly increased the
mean liver dose (29.24 Gy vs. 25.04 Gy, respectively, p =
0.009) [19]. Lee et al. analyzed the dosimetric parameters of
3D-CRT, linac-based IMRT and HT. HT could achieve the
best tumor coverage, but HT’s mean liver dose was highest
among the techniques [20]. Although liver toxicity is fre￾quently combined with the influence of chemotherapy, dis￾ease progression or hepatitis B viral activation, further study
is needed to determine if HT can reduce the incidence of
RILD while improving the dose conformity with the price of
an increased mean hepatic dose.
Regarding the gastrointestinal complication following
hypofractionated radiotherapy in treating PVTT, gastric
or duodenal ulcer could be a serious toxicity due to the
proximity of portal vein to the stomach or duodenum.
We experienced 2 patients suffered from duodenal ulcer
bleeding (5.7%) which was managed with medication or
endoscopic procedures. Other study using HT for 20
patients reported 1 patient with melena secondary to
gastric ulcer bleeding. Considering that their total dose
was 50 Gy in 20 fractions which was lower compared
with current study of 45–60 Gy in 10 fractions, hypo￾fractionated radiotherapy with HT in the present study
was performed safely [14].
Conclusions
This is the first study to treat HCC patients with PVTT by
hypofractionated radiotherapy schedule during short
period using HT. Radiation dose escalation was safely per￾formed and treatment response rate and overall survival
was good as expected with high dose of radiation even in
the patients with poor performance status (ECOG scale
2). Strict patient selection through Child-Pugh class and/
or JIS score will maximize potential benefits of our treat￾ment. However, hypofractionated radiotherapy using HT
(or IMRT) in advanced HCC with PVTT needs to be fur￾ther investigated through prospective clinical trial in large
number of HCC patients.
