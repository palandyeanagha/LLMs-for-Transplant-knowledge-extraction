Ischaemic retinopathy occurring in patients
receiving bone marrow allografts and
campath- 1 G: a clinicopathological study
A R Webster, J R Anderson, E M Richards, A T Moore
Abstract
Aims/Background-Ischaemic retino￾pathy is a well characterised complica￾tion of bone marrow transplantation
(BMT). Although the aetiology is
unclear, it is most probably multifac￾torial, and may be related to treatment
such as radiation and cyclosporin A. The
clinical findings are reported of two
patients who developed such a retino￾pathy and the ocular histology from one
of these cases is presented.
Methods-Two patients underwent BMT
for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia,
receiving campath-IG for prophylaxis
against graft versus host disease, and
showed fundal changes compatible with
BMT retinopathy. The eyes from one
patient were retrieved at post mortem and
examined by both light and electron
microscopy.
Results-The visual symptoms and fundal
signs resolved spontaneously with no
specific treatment in one patient. Light
and electron microscopic examination of
the eyes of the other patient was com￾patible with an ischaemic aetiology and
showed evidence of retinal capillary
endothelial loss.
Conclusions-(i) Histopathology in one
case of BMT retinopathy demonstrates
a retinal endotheliopathy similar to
that described in radiation retinopathy.
(ii) BMT retinopathy may occur in the
absence of cyclosporin A treatment.
(iii) The retinopathy can recover spon￾taneously with no specific treatment.

Leukaemia can have widespread effects on the
eye including direct infiltration of the tissues of
the eye by leukaemic cells and the effects of
further haematological abnormalities such as
anaemia, hyperviscosity, and thrombocyto￾penia.1 The treatment of leukaemia includes
chemotherapy, irradiation, and bone marrow
transplantation (BMT) all of which can
adversely affect the eye.24 A specific abnormal￾ity has been reported in the literature"9 and
termed 'bone marrow transplant retinopathy'
(BMT retinopathy) which we believe to be
exhibited by the cases presented here. Although
the pathogenesis remains unknown and is prob￾ably multifactorial, cyclosporin A used as pro￾phylaxis against graft versus host disease
(GVHD) has been implicated.67 The agent
used instead of cyclosporin A in our two
patients was campath-1G - a monoclonal anti￾body of the IgG2b subclass against a specific
glycoprotein expressed on mature lymphocytes
and monocytes but not expressed on cells of the
myeloid series. Its use is both to deplete donor
lymphocytes and therefore decrease the chances
of GVHD and to ensure the depletion of any
surviving recipient lymphocytes so reducing the
probability of graft failure. It is used in the man￾agement of BMT in many centres.
Patients and methods
CASE 1
A 10-year-old boy was found to have acute
lymphoblastic leukaemia and remission was
induced with a standard regimen of
chemotherapy (UKALL1 1). Included in the
initial therapy was a single dose of
1800 cGy cranial irradiation for prophylaxis
against CNS disease. After remaining well on
maintenance chemotherapy for 2 years all
treatment was stopped.
After 2 further years of good health he
presented with pyrexia and was found to have
relapsed. A standard combination of
chemotherapy (the UKALLR1 regimen) was
commenced. Four months after relapse, he
received a bone marrow allograft from his
HLA identical sister. His own marrow was
harvested and he was given 1440 cGy of
fractionated (180 cGy twice daily X4) total
body irradiation (TBI). Campath- 1 G was
given to the patient and to the donor marrow
for prophylaxis against GVHD.
Ten weeks after the allograft, he remained
leukopenic indicating that the graft had failed.
His own marrow was re-transplanted as an
autograft. Although his red and white cell
counts returned to normal he remained persis￾tently thrombocytopenic. Also, he was found
to have a right sided homonymous hemi￾anopia and to be confused. A cerebrovascular
accident was diagnosed, although imaging of
the brain was at that time precluded by ill
health. The patient complained of blurred
vision, and was found to have abnormalities
on funduscopy. During this time a Candida
septicaemia was found and intravenous
amphotericin was commenced. An ophthal￾mic opinion was sought.
Acuities of only counting fingers were
obtained although testing was impaired by
ill health. A right sided relative homony￾mous hemianopia was confirmed. The
pupils appeared to constrict normally and
symmetrically to light. Funduscopy (Fig 1)

showed bilateral cotton wool spots and retinal
haemorrhages particularly at the posterior
poles. These areas coincided with areas of
capillary non-perfusion on fluorescein angio￾graphy (Fig 2). There was late leakage of
fluorescein at the ischaemic areas but there
was no oedema affecting the foveae. The optic
discs were thought to be slightly swollen
although there was no disc leakage of fluores￾cein. The media were entirely clear. A
diagnosis of BMT retinopathy was made.
No specific treatment was instituted and
over
a period of
1 month, the vision remained
poor and the retinal appearances showed
some worsening. Unfortunately the patient
remained ill and died in respiratory failure
shortly thereafter. Consent was obtained for
a
limited post mortem in which both eyes were
taken for examination.
The eyes were taken shortly after death. One
eye was placed in neutral buffered formalin for
light microscopy and the other was incised and
placed in glutaraldehyde for electron micro￾scopy.
CASE
2
A 19-year-old female was diagnosed as having
acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and while in
complete remission started on standard induc￾tion chemotherapy. Four months after presen￾tation she received a bone marrow allograft
from her HIA identical brother. The patient's
own bone marrow was harvested and TBI of
a
single dose of 950 cGy was given with an addi￾tional 1000 cGy 'cranial boost' (5X200 cGy
fractions) to the brain and spinal cord.
Campath-1G was given to the patient and the
donor marrow as prophylaxis against GVHD.
After
4 weeks, she remained leukopenic and it

became clear that the allograft had failed.
Subsequent autografting was successful and
her full blood count returned to normal. Four
months after the allograft the patient com￾plained of blurred vision in both eyes and of a
rash affecting the left side of the face. An oph￾thalmic opinion was sought.
Examination revealed
a typical herpes zoster
rash affecting the left ophthalmic and maxillary
divisions. There was no involvement of the left
anterior segment. The best corrected acuities
were 6/9 bilaterally. The media were clear.
Both fundi showed retinal haemorrhages and
cotton wool spots around the posterior poles
(Fig 3). Fluorescein angiography revealed
areas of capillary non-perfusion corresponding
to the areas of cotton wool spots (Fig 4). There
was late leakage of fluorescein in these areas.
The patient remained generally well on no
systemic treatment. The visual symptoms and
facial rash improved completely and when re￾examined 6 months later her acuities were 6/5
bilaterally and the retinopathy had markedly
regressed with only
a few scattered retinal
haemorrhages remaining.
One year after the bone marrow allograft she
became unwell and was found to have
relapsed. She died
1 month later.

infarcts showed an oedematous nerve fibre
layer containing foci of cytoid bodies (Fig 6).
Ischaemic ganglion cells and neurons of the
inner plexiform layer were shrunken and
eosinophilic. The innermost layers of the retina
contained small haemorrhages but no capillary
abnormalities. The outer layers of the neuro￾sensory retina, the retinal pigment epithelium,
and the choroid appeared normal. There was
no evidence of any organisms or malignant
cells and there was a notable absence of any
inflammatory cell infiltration.
Electron microscopy confirmed the cytoid
bodies as axonal swellings filled with degenerate
organelles. The lumen of adjacent capillaries
contained clumped erythrocytes and these
vessels showed loss of endothelial cells with
relative preservation of the pericytes (Fig 7).
Discussion
The eye can be adversely affected in leukaemic
patients owing to both haematological abnor￾malities' and also the side effects of treat￾ment.2A As the causes of cotton wool spots are
numerous10 the differential diagnosis of an
ischaemic retinopathy occurring in such cases
remains wide. Although case 2 presented with
a herpes zoster rash, the fundal appearances
and fluorescein angiogram were unlike those of
a viral retinitis. In case 1, systemic Candida
infection was noted although the ophthalmic
signs were not consistent with a Candida
uveitis, and the histology excluded an infective
retinitis.
Cotton wool spots occurring in BMT recip￾ients were first described by Gratwohl et a15

and Gloor et al.6 Subsequent to this, Bernauer
et al published the results of a large prospective
study7 in which 13 of 127 patients developed
an ischaemic retinopathy within 6 months of
BMT. The retinopathy significantly was only
seen in patients receiving both TBI (for malig￾nancies) and cyclosporin A (following allo￾graft), suggesting that both these agents were
necessary to develop retinal lesions. Other
studies have also reported an ischaemic
retinopathy89 and optic disc swelling" after
BMT although the relation with cyclosporin A
and radiation is less clear.9
The ocular involvement of acute GVHD is
usually confined to the anterior segment and
an ischaemic retinopathy is not thought to be a
recognised feature.4 12 A recent series, how￾ever, did cite chronic GVHD as a risk factor for
the development of cotton wool spots.9 These
patients showed no systemic or other ocular

Radiation retinopathy, a phenomenon first
described by Stallard in 1933, has a clinical
appearance that includes telangiectasia, retinal
haemorrhages, cotton wool spots, macular
oedema, and neovascularisation.'0 13 The
w retinopathy rarely develops earlier than 6
:.t.. 4. ..:: months after irradiation, the latent period
3.,' usually being a number of years and the total
dose rarely below 3500 cGy.14 Each of our
s-;|< patients received TBI in an attempt to deplete
*t , ^- the host of all leukaemic cells before BMT.
They both developed a retinopathy within 6
months of receiving TBI, the total doses to the
retina being 3240 cGy (fractionated) and 2950
K7-f.i * cGy (unfractionated). The eye was necessarily
included in the field of irradiation in each case
as acute lymphoblastic leukaemia has a
predilection for the CNS and the eye. Electron
microscopy in cases of radiation retinopathy
has shown endothelial cell loss with relative
¢.^ preservation of pericytes.'3 This finding is also
evident in case 1 suggesting that BMT
retinopathy may share a similar pathogenesis
with radiation retinopathy involving initial
e8Xi # endothelial cell loss. However, the rapid onset,
atypical appearance, and lower doses of radia￾tion suggest that other causative factors may
also be implicated in the retinopathy in our
patients.
The characteristics and applications of the
campath-1 antibodies, which were used in the
conditioning of our cases before BMT, have
been described.'5 It is unlikely that the cam￾path agent itself causes immune complex for￾mation and subsequent retinopathy as there
are no soluble blood borne campath antigens.
The antibody has been found to be unreactive
ibre layer (haematoxylin to some other human tissues in vitro and in
ei'fonned by aggregates of vivo although the authors are unaware of any er stain for axons.)

Ischaemic retinopathy occurring in patients receiving bone marrow allografts and campath-l G: a clinicopathological study
specific work on campath antibody and the
retina.
We feel that it is likely that the retinopathy in
these patients is similar to that previously
labelled as BMT retinopathy. The pathogenesis
of this entity remains enigmatic. Cyclosporin A
itself does not appear to cause retinopathy.'6
Radiation itself is unlikely to be the sole cause,
although clinically and pathologically the two
retinopathies share some similarities. Both
cyclosporin A and campath-IG are designed to
inhibit the function of T cells. It is interesting to
propose that normal T cell function may be
necessary for the protection of retinal endo￾thelial cells from such insults as irradiation
which may lower the threshold for subsequent
endothelial loss and retinal ischaemia. Similarly,
perhaps, abnormal T cell function may also be
implicated in the development of the morpho￾logically similar entity of HIV retinopathy
which, despite investigation, has an unexplained
aetiology and whose histology has similarities to
the cases presented here.17
