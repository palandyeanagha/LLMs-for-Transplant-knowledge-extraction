Abstract. Sarcopenia is a prognostic factor for patients with 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Cancer rehabilitation (CR) 
improves patients' physical function and muscle mass. We 
investigated the effects of CR on the prognosis of patients 
with HCC. The present study was a prospective observational 
study, which analyzed 152 patients with HCC who underwent 
transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) between 
2013 and 2016. Patients were classified into the CR (n=85) 
and control (n=67) groups. The effects of CR on muscle 
mass were evaluated by changes in the skeletal muscle index 
(SMI) before and after TACE. Independent factors associated 
with survival were evaluated by Cox regression analysis. 
Kaplan‑Meier analysis was used to compare the survival rate 
between the CR and control groups. The difference in survival 
rate between the two groups was also examined after propen￾sity score matching. SMI was significantly increased in the 
CR group compared with the control group. In Cox regres￾sion analysis, independent factors associated with survival 
were CR and Child‑Pugh class A (estimate 1.760, 95% CI 
0.914‑3.226, P=0.001; estimate 1.602, 95% CI 0.426‑2.998, 
P=0.0129). The survival rate was significantly higher in the 
CR group than in the control group (median 552 vs. 424 days; 
P=0.0359). The survival rate was also significantly higher in 
the CR group than that in the control group after propensity 
score matching (median 529 vs. 369 days; P=0.0332). CR was 
associated with prolonged survival in patients with HCC who 
underwent TACE. Patients with cancer are recommended to 
maintain physical activity even during cancer treatment.
Introduction
Exercise is recommended for patients with various diseases 
including cancer (1,2). Walking as well as resistance training 
has been reported to improve physical function and skeletal 
muscle mass in patients with cancer (3,4). In accordance with 
the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines, exercise 
training is a key recommendation to maintain activity even 
in cancer patients (5). Cancer rehabilitation (CR), a new 
multidisciplinary intervention for cancer patients, consists of 
nutritional and physical therapy. CR improves fatigue, pain, 
physical function, and quality of life in patients with cancer (6).
Sarcopenia is defined as loss of skeletal muscle mass and 
function. Sarcopenia frequently occurs in patients with chronic 
liver disease (CLD) regardless of its etiology (7,8). Sarcopenia 
in patients with CLD is associated with a decline in their 
quality of life and physical activity (9). Sarcopenia is also 
significantly associated with hepatic fibrosis (10). Moreover, 
sarcopenia is an independent prognostic factor for hepatocel￾lular carcinoma (HCC) (11). Taken together, it is important to 
pay attention to sarcopenia in patients with CLD.
In patients with cirrhosis and esophageal varices, 
moderate‑intensity exercise increases portal pressure and 
may, therefore, increase the risk of variceal bleeding (12). 
In addition, moderate‑intensity exercise stimulates the renal 
vasoconstrictor system, markedly impairing the renal function 
in patients with cirrhosis and ascites (13). In this way, exercise 
may exacerbate the general condition of patients of cirrhosis 
with complications such as esophageal varices and ascites. 
However, Hiraoka et al (14) showed that branched‑chain 
amino acid (BCAA) supplementation and low‑intensity exer￾cise are effective for improving muscle volume and strength 
in patients with CLD. In addition, Locklear et al (15) demon￾strated that, even in patients with end‑stage liver disease,

2356 HASHIDA et al: EXERCISE IMPROVED PROGNOSIS OF PATIENTS WITH HCC
exercise has potential benefits in terms of endurance and 
functional outcome measures without adverse effects. We also 
previously reported that CR improved not only physical ability 
but also muscle mass without worsening liver function during 
hospitalization for cancer treatment in patients with CLD and 
advanced HCC (16,17).
Thus, CR has beneficial effects on sarcopenia in patients 
with CLD and HCC; however, the effects of CR on prognosis 
remain unclear in patients with CLD and advanced HCC. This 
study aimed to investigate the effects of CR on the prognosis 
of patients with CLD and advanced HCC.
Patients and methods
Study design. CR for in‑hospital patients with cancer is an 
approved health care service covered by health insurance 
from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan. 
Therefore, intentionally using a non‑exercise control group is 
contrary to medical ethics. Thus, we performed a prospective 
cohort study to evaluate effects of CR on skeletal muscle mass 
during hospitalization for patients with HCC and CLD who 
underwent TACE.
Ethics. The study was conducted in accordance with the 
ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki, as reflected 
in the prior approval given by the institutional review board 
of Kurume University (approval no. 15072). Informed consent 
was obtained from an opt‑out approach, and personal informa￾tion was protected during data collection.
Subjects. A total of 152 consecutive patients with HCC and 
CLD from February 2013 to October 2016 participated in 
this study. Inclusion criteria were hospitalized patients with 
HCC and CLD who (1) were 20 years of age or older, (2) had 
a performance status of grade 0 to 2 as defined by the Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group (18), and (3) had undergone treat￾ment with TACE. Exclusion criteria were patients with (1) risk 
of HCC rupture, (2) history or presence of grade 2‑4 hepatic 
encephalopathy according to the West Haven Criteria (19), 
(3) risk of esophageal or gastric varices rupture, (4) heart 
failure, or (5) respiratory failure. The exclusion criteria were 
assessed upon study enrollment. All patients underwent upper 
gastrointestinal endoscopy by gastroenterologists every 6 
to 12 months, and the risk of esophageal or gastric varices 
rupture was assessed according to the 2015 evidence‑based 
clinical practice guidelines for liver cirrhosis from the Japanese 
Society of Gastroenterology (20). The definition of heart 
failure was based on guidelines from the American College 
of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association Task 
Force and Heart Failure Society of America (21,22). The 
definition of respiratory failure was based on guidelines 
from the European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic 
Society (23,24). Outpatient doctors and nurses recommended 
exercise to all patients. Patients who agreed to exercise were 
classified into the CR group (n=85), and those who did not 
agree to exercise were classified into the control group (n=67). 
We classified enrolled patients into the High SMI or Low SMI 
group according to the JSH criteria for sarcopenia (7), and the 
High VFA or Low VFA group as previously described (25). 
We also divided the patients into the High or Low LDH group 
and the High total protein group or Low total protein group 
based on the reference values of serum LDH and total protein 
levels, respectively.
Exercise regimen. To maintain physical ability and prevent 
sarcopenia, patients in the CR group were treated with 
exercise, instructed by physical therapists certified in the 
rehabilitation of cancer patients. The rehabilitation was started 
on the day following TACE unless the patient had a fever of 
38̊C or greater as previously described (16). The frequency 
and duration of exercise performed were recorded during the 
hospitalization. After discharge, patients in the CR group were 
instructed to continue the exercises by themselves during the 
observation period.
According to the guidelines of American College of Sports 
Medicine (26), the exercise consisted of the following 4 types 
of training (median 2.5 metabolic equivalents/20‑40 min/day): 
1) stretching, 2) strength training, 3) balance training, and 4) 
endurance training(16,17). A static stretching was conducted for 
3‑5 min, targeting the quadriceps femoris muscles, hamstrings, 
hip adductor muscles, and gastrocnemius. The static stretch 
was held to each muscle for 10‑20 seconds at the point of 
feeling tightness (16,25). Strength training was conducted for 
10 min, targeting the quadriceps femoris muscles, gastrocne￾mius, and tibialis anterior muscles. Quadriceps femoris muscle 
and iliopsoas strength training were conducted at moderate to 
high intensity by a hand‑held dynamometer. Gastrocnemius 
and tibialis anterior muscles were conducted trained by the 
patient's weight. One set contained of 10 repetitions, and a 
maximum of 3 sets were performed (16,25). Balance training 
contain the patients practicing a one‑leg stance and tandem 
stance for 5‑10 min. The patient stood on a straight line and 
maintain posture in tandem stance training (16,25). Endurance 
training contained either ergometer or walking for 10‑15 min. 
The intensity of endurance training was 11‑13 points on the 
Borg scale, and the target heart rate was set by using the 
Karvonen Formula (16,25).
Diagnosis, the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging 
system, tumor node metastasis (TNM) staging, and treatment of 
HCC. HCC was diagnosed by a combination of tests for serum 
tumor makers, such as alpha‑fetoprotein and des‑γ‑carboxy 
prothrombin, and imaging procedures, such as ultrasonog￾raphy, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI), and angiography, or a tumor biopsy (27). We 
evaluated the clinical stage of HCC using the Barcelona Clinic 
Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system (27) and TNM staging 
based on the Liver Cancer Study Group of Japan criteria (28). 
We treated the patients according to clinical practice guidelines 
for HCC of The Japan Society of Hepatology (29).
Additional treatment for recurrence of HCC after initial TACE. 
When HCC recurred, additional treatment for HCC was selected 
based on The Japan Society of Hepatology Consensus‑Based 
Treatment Algorithm for HCC (28). Moreover, additional HCC 
treatment with hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy/tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors was selected when HCC showed TACE 
failure/refractoriness defined by any of following criteria: i) 
an ineffective response after two or more consecutive TACE 
procedures that is evident on response evaluation CT or MRI 

ONCOLOGY LETTERS 19: 2355-2367, 2020 2357
after 1‑3 months, even after chemotherapeutic agents are 
changed and/or the feeding artery is reanalyzed; ii) two or more 
consecutive progressions in the liver (including an increase in 
the number of tumors compared to that before the previous 
TACE procedure), even after changing the chemotherapeutic 
agents and/or reanalysis of feeding artery, on response evalua￾tion CT/MRI after 1‑3 months following adequately performed 
selective TACE; iii) continuous elevation of tumor markers 
right after TACE even though transient minor reduction is 
observed; iv) appearance of vascular invasion, or v) appearance 
of extrahepatic spread (28).
Measurement of skeletal muscle index (SMI) and visceral fat 
area (VFA). SMI and VFA were evaluated using CT images 
obtained before and after TACE. The first CT images were 
obtained to evaluate HCC before TACE. The second CT images 
were obtained to evaluate the effectiveness of TACE against 
HCC. VFA was measure at slices at the umbilical level (29). 
We measured skeletal muscle mass and VFA by using manual 
tracings on CT images, and their sum was calculated using 
Image‑J software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, 
MD, USA) (30). Skeletal muscle mass was normalized by the 
square of the height, and the data was expressed as SMI.
Measurement of physical function. Grip strength, 10‑meter 
walking speed, and 6‑min walking test were evaluated by 
qualified physical therapists. Handgrip was measured on 
the non‑dominant hand using a dynamometer (TKK5401; 
Takei Scientific Instruments Co., Ltd.) according to Japan 
Society of Hepatology guidelines (7). The 10‑meter walking 
speed was measured to evaluate gait speed. To evaluate the 
10‑meter maximal gait time, 2 meters were added to allow for 
acceleration before and deceleration after the 10‑meter gait 
test, respectively (31). The 6‑min walking test was measured 
by evaluating the total ambulated distance according to the 
American Thoracic Society guidelines (32).
Biochemical tests. We measured following blood biochemical 
tests; aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, 
alkaline phosphatase, gamma‑glutamyl transpeptidase, 
albumin, total bilirubin, creatinine, estimated glomerular 
filtration rate, creatine kinase, hemoglobin A1c, prothrombin 
activity, and platelet count. We also measured serum levels of 
α‑fetoprotein, des‑γ‑carboxy prothrombin.
Changes in variables before and after TACE. Changes in SMI 
and VFA between pre‑ and post‑TACE were evaluated by the 
ΔSMI, and ΔVFA. In addition, ΔSMI and ΔVFA were evalu￾ated by a stratification analysis according to sex. Similarly, 
changes in each physical function were evaluated by the Δ 
variables. All Δvariables were evaluated by change in the vari￾able (Δ variable = variable after TACE‑variable before TACE).
Definition of event and follow‑up. An event was defined as 
death from any cause in this study. After discharge, patients 
were followed up until death or the study censor date by 
routine physical examinations, biochemical tests, and ultraso￾nography, CT, or magnetic resonance imaging according to the 
HCC guidelines of the Japan Society of Hepatology (29). The 
median observation period was 511 days (range, 13‑1180 days).
Statistical analysis. Data are expressed as the median (inter￾quartile range [IQR]), range, or number. The differences 
between the control and CR groups were analyzed by using 
Wilcoxon rank sum tests. The difference ΔSMI in CR group 
among the etiologies of liver disease (multiple groups) was 
examined by analysis of variance followed by Scheffe's post 
hoc test. The difference ΔSMI between female and male or 
Child‑Pugh class A and B/C were analyzed by using Wilcoxon 
rank sum tests. The level of statistical significance was set at 
P<0.05.
A multivariate Cox regression analysis with a stepwise 
variable selection was used to identify independent variables 
associated with the prognosis of patients with HCC. In the 
present study, we did not conduct a univariate analysis, and 
the explanatory variables were selected in a stepwise manner, 
minimizing the Bayesian information criterion as previously 
described (33). Overall survival analysis was performed using 
the Kaplan‑Meier method followed by the log‑rank test.
Propensity scores for all the patients were estimated by a 
logistic regression model using the following baseline char￾acteristics as covariates: Age, sex, BCLC stage, Child‑Pugh 
score, and BCAA supplementation as previously described (2). 
To generate 88 pairs of patients, we employed a one‑to‑one 
nearest‑neighbor matching algorithm with an optimal caliper 
of 0.2 without replacement. The c‑statistic in this study was 
0.603, and 88 CLD patients with HCC (control [n=44] and CR 
[n=44]) were analyzed.
All the statistical analyses were performed using JMP®13 
software (SAS Institute Inc.) or the R software package (R 
Foundation for Statistical Computing, 2012).
Results
Patient characteristics. Patient characteristics data were 
obtained before TACE. The characteristics, the CR and 
control group are shown in Table I. Patients in the CR group 
were significantly older than those in the control group. The 
VFA in the CR group was significantly higher than that in the 
control group. However, there was no significant difference in 
the female‑to‑male ratio, body mass index, or SMI between 
the CR and control groups. No significant difference was seen 
in TNM stage, BCLC classification, or levels of α‑fetoprotein 
and des‑γ‑carboxy prothrombin. There was no significant 
difference in Child‑Pugh classification, hemoglobin A1c 
value, or estimated glomerular filtration rate between the CR 
and control groups (Table I).
No significant difference was observed between the CR 
and control groups regarding the prevalence of patients treated 
with BCAA supplementation, hospitalization period, or the 
evaluation interval for CT (Table I). There was no significant 
difference in the number of TACE sessions at the baseline, 
number of TACE sessions during the observation period, or 
additional HCC treatment with hepatic arterial infusion of 
chemotherapy/tyrosine kinase inhibitors during the observa￾tion period (Table I). There were no patients who underwent 
liver transplants during the observation periods.
During the hospitalization, the median length of thera￾peutic exercise was 6.5 days (IQR, 5‑9 days; range, 2‑26 days) 
in the CR group with a median of 3.33 h of exercise performed 
(IQR, 2.67‑4.42 h; range, 1‑8.67 h).

Changes in SMI and VFA. We evaluated changes in SMI by 
the difference in SMI between before and after TACE. After 
treatment with TACE, ΔSMI was significantly higher in the 
CR group than in the control group. There was no significant 
difference between the CR and control groups regarding the 
ΔSMI in male patients. On the other hand, there was a signifi￾cant difference between the CR and control groups regarding 
ΔSMI in female patients (Fig. 1). The ΔSMI had no significant 
association with the etiology of liver disease in the CR group 
(Fig. S1). Moreover, in the CR group, ΔSMI was not signifi￾cantly different between male and female patients or between 
patients classified as Child‑Pugh class A and Child‑Pugh class 
B/C (Fig. S1B and C). There was no significant difference 
in the ΔVFA between the CR and control groups. Moreover, 
there was no significant difference in VFA between the CR 
and control groups in both male and female patients (Fig. 1).
Correlations between survival period and Δ each variable. 
Correlations between survival period and the alterations in 
body composition and physical performance were evalu￾ated using pairwise correlations. There was no significant 
correlation between the survival period and ΔSMI or ΔVFA 
(Table II). Moreover, no significant correlation was seen 
between the survival period and Δ grip strength, Δ10 meter 
walking speed, or Δ6‑min walking test (Table II).
Associations between survival period and changes in SMI, 
and baseline SMI, VFA, and serum levels of LDH and total 
protein. We performed stratification analysis according the 
changes in SMI. There was no significant difference in survival 
rate between the patients with increased and decreased SMI 
in all patients (median 526 vs. 459 days, P=0.6206; Fig. 2). 
The impact of changes in SMI on survival was also examined 
in the CR and control groups. No significant difference was 
seen in survival between the patients with increased SMI and 
decreased SMI in both the CR and control groups (CR group; 
increased SMI vs. decreased SMI; median 541 vs. 569 days, 
P=0.3856; control group: Increased SMI vs. decreased SMI, 
median 379 vs. 432 days, P=0.5201; Figs. S2A and B). We 
also performed stratified analysis for survival according to the 
several baseline clinical parameters. There was no significant 
difference in survival rate between the High and Low SMI

groups (P=0.7064) and between the High and Low VFA groups 
(P=0.7530). There was no significant difference in the survival 
rate between the High and Low LDH groups (P=0.1095). There 
was no significant difference in the survival rate between the 
High and Low total protein groups (P=1.0330).
Independent factors associated with survival. We evaluated 
the independent factors associated with survival using Cox 
regression analysis. There was significant difference in serum 
level of LDH and total protein between the CR and control 
groups in univariate analysis. However, these factors were 
not identified as an independent factor for survival in the Cox 
regression analysis. The CR group and Child‑Pugh class A 
were identified as independent positive factors associated with 
survival (Table III). Although BCLC stage was not signifi￾cantly associated with survival, the number of TACE sessions 
at baseline were an independent negative factor for survival 
(Table III). The number of TACE sessions during the observa￾tion period and additional HCC treatment with hepatic arterial 
infusion of chemotherapy/tyrosine kinase inhibitors during the 
observation period were not selected by a stepwise procedure.
We also evaluated independent factors associated with 
survival in the CR and control groups respectively. In the CR 
group, the number of TACE sessions during the observation 
and Child‑Pugh class were identified as independent factors 
for survival (P=0.0004 and P=0.0278). In the Control group, 
BCLC stage was identified as an independent factor for the 
survival (P=0.0034).
Impact of CR on survival period. Kaplan‑Meier analysis was 
used to compare the survival rate between the CR and control 
groups. The median observation period was 511 days (range, 
13‑1180 days). The survival rate of the CR group was signifi￾cantly higher than that of the control group on Kaplan‑Meier 
analysis (median 552 vs. 424 days, P=0.0359; Fig. 3A).
Impact of CR on survival period after propensity score 
matching. After propensity score matching, we evaluated 
overall survival by Kaplan‑Meier analysis. Propensity scores 
for all the patients were estimated using the following base￾line characteristics as covariates: Age, sex, BCLC stage, 
Child‑Pugh score, and BCAA supplementation. There was no 
significant difference in observation period between the CR 
and control groups (Table IV). No significant difference was 
seen in number of TACE session at baseline and SMI between 
the two groups (Table IV). The survival rate of the CR group 
was significantly higher than that of the control group (median 
529 vs. 369 days, P=0.0332; Fig. 3B).
Discussion
In this study, we investigated effects of CR on the prognosis 
of patients with HCC who underwent TACE. The survival rate 
was higher in HCC patients with CR than in HCC patients 
without CR. Cox regression analysis demonstrated that CR 
was an independent factor for survival. These results may 
indicate that CR has beneficial effect on prognosis of patients 
with HCC who underwent TACE.
In the present study, SMI significantly increased in the CR 
group without worsening liver function in patients with CLD 
and HCC who underwent TACE. Dawson et al (34) showed 
that CR improves muscle mass in patients with prostate cancer 
during androgen treatment. We also reported previously that 
CR increased muscle mass in patients with HCC during treat￾ment (14). Taken together, CR may improve the muscle mass of 
patients with cancer in spite of treatment for cancer.
In the female, but not in the male, ΔSMI in the CR group 
was significantly higher than that in the control group. This 
gender difference could be accounted for a marked decrease

of ΔSMI in female of the control group. In our previous study, 
skeletal muscle mass was also significantly decreased in 
female than in male HCC patients who underwent TACE (35). 
A possible reason for the gender difference is sex hormones. 
Testosterone has potent anabolic effects on skeletal muscle, 
leading to muscle protein synthesis and subsequently increases 
muscle mass (36). Women have low serum testosterone levels 
and serum free testosterone levels are reported to be positively 
correlated with skeletal muscle mass in women (37).
The prognosis of solid malignancies is widely known to be 
dependent on the cancer stage, such as the TNM system (38). 
In this study, BCLC stage was not identified as an indepen￾dent factor associated with survival. It remains unclear why 
the stage of HCC was not a risk factor for survival. However, 
all enrolled patients with HCC were treated with TACE, and 
patients with BCLC stage B accounted for approximately 80% 
of enrolled patients. Therefore, the narrow distribution of HCC 
stage may be a possible reason that HCC stage was not a risk 
factor for the prognosis of HCC patients treated with TACE.
Loss of muscle mass is an independent prognostic factor 
for patients with HCC (11). Therefore, an increase in skeletal 
muscle mass is thought to be related to the improvement of the 
prognosis of patients with HCC. We investigated the impact of 
the change in SMI on survival in patients with HCC; however, 
an increase in SMI was not identified as an independent prog￾nostic factor in patients with HCC. In addition, there was no 
significant difference in survival rate between patients with 
increased SMI and patients with decreased SMI in all patients 
or in the CR group. Although CR is reported to improve the 
prognosis of patients with cancer (39), our study indicates 
Figure 3. (A) Difference in survival rate between the CR and control groups. (B) Difference in survival rate between the CR and control groups after propensity 
score matching. CR, cancer rehabilitation.

ONCOLOGY LETTERS 19: 2355-2367, 2020 2365
that CR may improve the prognosis regardless of changes in 
muscle mass in patients with HCC.
In this study, we first showed that maintaining physical 
activity by CR is more important than increasing muscle mass 
to improve the prognosis of patients with HCC. The benefi￾cial effect of CR was also observed after propensity score 
matching. Although it remains unclear why CR improved 
the prognosis, exercise is reported to exert several beneficial 
effects against cancer.
First, exercise may suppress the development and prolifera￾tion of HCC through modulation of insulin‑like growth factor 
1 signal. Insulin‑like growth factor 1 concentration is related 
to an increase in tumor growth and development of colon 
cancer in in vivo and in vitro studies (40). Exercise improves 
insulin resistance and decreases levels of insulin‑like growth 
factor 1 in patients with breast cancer (39). Moreover, exercise 
is also known to enhance the expression of p21, insulin‑like 
growth factor‑binding protein‑3, and PTEN, which suppress 
insulin‑like growth factor 1 signaling in a cancer mouse 
model (41).
Second, exercise may suppress HCC growth through 
suppression of the Warburg effect. Aerobic exercise is reported 
to exert an anti‑Warburg effect, leading to an increase in 
lactate clearance capacity in animal and human studies (42). 
Lactate is an important metabolic compound involved and 
necessary in all main sequela for carcinogenesis, specifically: 
Angiogenesis, immune escape, cell migration, metastasis, and 
self‑sufficient metabolism (42). Lactate metabolism is directly 
correlated with the prognosis of patients with cancer (43). 
Thus, exercise‑induced alteration in lactate metabolism may 
suppress HCC growth.
Besides the above mechanisms, myokines are known 
to suppress cancer cells directly and indirectly (44). 
Contracting muscle fibers release myokines including inter￾leukin, oncostatin, and secreted protein acidic and rich in 
cysteine (44). Interleukin is reported to increase mobilization 
of natural killer lymphocytes and to reduce the growth rate 
of liver cancer in an in vivo study (45). Oncostatin M was 
reported to have an anti‑proliferative and apoptotic effect on 
breast‑cancer cells in an in vivo study (46). Secreted protein 
acidic and rich in cysteine is known to be associated with 
apoptosis of colon cancer cells in mice and humans (47). Thus, 
a possible hypothesis is that CR may inhibit progression of 
HCC through up‑regulation of myokines, leading to improve￾ment in the prognosis.
There were limitations in this study. This was not a random￾ized controlled trial with constant duration of CR and irregular 
time intervals between the first and second CT. Patients who 
did not agree to exercise were defined as the control group. 
In addition, the exclusion criteria for the CR group would 
be associated with death. Thus, patients in the control group 
might be more deconditioned than patients in the CR group. 
Second, we did not evaluate the physical activity of patients 
before TACE and after discharge. Continuous execution of CR 
should have been evaluated at outpatient visits. Third, changes 
in eating habits were not evaluated in this study. Since exercise 
is known to affect eating habits (48) and, changes in eating 
habits might be a confounding factor of CR. Fourth, there were 
no patients who underwent liver transplantation during the 
observation period, suggesting the selection bias. Fifth, we did 
not evaluate any immune‑related variable, although exercise 
is known to activate immunity and may suppress proliferation 
of cancer cells through modulation of regulation of the tumor 
microenvironment (49,50). Thus, multicenter randomized 
controlled trials should be conducted with constant duration 
of CR and regular interval of CT examinations, evaluation 
of physical activity and eating habits before and after TACE, 
and various treatments for HCC after TACE, including liver 
transplantation. In addition, effects of CR on immune‑related 
variable should be evaluated to elucidate the mechanisms for 
CR‑related improvement of prognosis in patients with HCC.
In conclusion, we showed that CR not only increased 
muscle mass but also prolonged survival in patients with HCC 
who underwent TACE. Moreover, CR, but not an increase in 
muscle mass, was an independent factor for survival. Thus, 
exercise may exert beneficial effects on the prognosis indepen￾dent from muscle hypertrophy in patients with HCC. Patients 
with HCC are recommended to maintain physical activity 
rather than be on bed rest even after a diagnosis of HCC.
