A B S T R A C T Incubation of human leukocytes with
ascorbic acid at neutral pH and at concentrations 10-50
times that of normal blood levels augmented both the
in vitro random migration and chemotaxis of the cells
by 100-300% without influencing their phagocytic ca￾pacity. Enhancement of mobility by ascorbate was evi￾dent for isolated neutrophils, eosinophils, and mono￾nuclear leukocytes and was independent of the specific
chemotactic stimulus. Stimulation by ascorbate of the
hexose monophosphate shunt of adherent neutrophils
and augmentation by ascorbate of neutrophil mobility
had comparable dose-response relationships, could be
reversed by washing the cells, and were both suppressed
by preincubation of the neutrophils with 6-aminonico￾tinamide, but not with the neutrophil-immobilizing fac￾tor. Glutathione, the proposed intermediate for ascorbate
action, similarly stimulated hexose monophosphate shunt
activity and enhanced migration. The enhancement in
vitro of leukocyte mobility by ascorbate at concentrations
found in some normal tissues, therefore, appears to be
dependent upon stimulation of the leukocyte hexose
monophosphate shunt.
INTRODUCTION
Adherent human neutrophils interacting with purified
chemotactic factors demonstrated a two- to six-fold in￾crease in the activity of their hexose monophosphate
shunt (HMPS)' (1). Maneuvers which suppressed the

chemotactic response of mobile leukocytes, such as treat￾ment with diisopropyl fluorophosphate or with the neu￾trophil-immobilizing factor (NIF), did not prevent
stimulation of the HMPS of adherent neutrophils. Al￾though stimulation of the HMPS alone was not suffi￾cient for chemotaxis, preincubation with 6-aminonico￾tinamide, which blocked the enhanced HMPS activity
associated with the introduction of a chemotactic stimu￾lus, partially suppressed the chemotactic response to di￾verse stimuli (2). To assess further the relationship of
HMPS stimulation to a chemotactic response, ascorbic
acid, which is known to increase leukocyte HMPS ac￾tivity (1, 3), was examined for its effect on the random
migration and chemotaxis of human leukocytes.
METHODS

of B-D Laboratories, Inc., Los Angeles, Calif.) were ob￾tained from the manufacturers. Rice starch (Whittaker,
Clark and Daniels, Inc., New York) was washed five times
in distilled water, incubated with autologous fresh human
serum for 1 h at 37° C, and washed again three times in
saline before use. Ascorbic acid was made up as a 0.1 N
stock solution and titrated to pH 7.4 in an ice bath by drop￾wise addition of 0.4 N NaOH.
NIF, derived from 1 X 107 lhuman leukocytes which had
either been incubated at 37'C in 1 ml of buffer alone (con￾trol for NIF) or engaged in plhagocytosis of starch par￾ticles (PhNIF), was partially purified by heating and by
gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 (4).
Gamma radiation from 5"Cr-containing micropore filters
used in radiochemotactic chambers was measured with a
dual-channel gamma well counter, and beta radiation from
[14C] glucose solutions was quantitated with Bray's fluid
in a liquid scintillation counter (Nuclear-Chicago Corp.,
Des Plaines, Ill.).
Collection and purification of human leuikocytes. Mixed
peripheral leukocytes from normal human subjects were
collected and separated from erythrocytes by dextran sedi￾mentation, and the contaminating erythrocytes were lysed
with 0.84%o NH4Cl as previously described (1). Neutrophils
and mononuclear leukocytes were further purified by cen￾trifugation of mixed leukocytes on Ficoll-Hypaque cushions
(6). Eosinophils from patients with hypereosinophilic syn￾dromes were purified from mixed leukocytes in dextran￾treated plasma by centrifugation on metrizoate cushions
(7). All leukocytes were washed twice with Hanks's solu￾tion before their function was assessed.
Aleasuremitent of chemotaxis anid random miigration.
Chemotaxis of human leukocytes was assayed by a previ￾ously detailed modification (4) of the Boyden micropore
filter assay, employing 3-,Lm micropore filters for neutro￾phils, eosinophils, and mixed leukocytes, and 8-,um micro￾pore filters for mononuclear leukocytes (8), and also by
a radiochemotactic method which utilizes modified cham￾bers that hold a layer of two micropore filters between
51Cr-labeled leukocytes and the chemotactic stimulus (5).
The medium for all cells was Hanks's balanced salt solu￾tion-0.5 g per 100 ml in ovalbumin (pH 7.4). The chemo￾tactic factors were eosinophil chemotactic factor of anaphy￾laxis (ECF-A) purified from anaphylactic diffusates of
human lung by Sephadex G-25 chromatogra,phy (9), human
C5a generated by tryptic digestion of highly purified C5
(10), and human kallikrein generated from purified pre￾kallikrein by activation with Hageman factor fragments
(11). For the modified Boyden technique, initial cell sus￾pensions contained 1.5-2.0 X 106 cells and the incubation
time was 21> h. The leukocyte counts were expressed as the
mean of 10 high power fields (hpf), 5 from each of
duplicate chambers, corrected for background counts in
filters from chambers without a chemotactic stimulus. For
the radiochemotactic procedure, the initial cell suspensions
contained 5-6 X 10' cells and the incubation time was 4 h.
The chemotactic response in duplicate chambers was calcu￾lated as net percent radioactivity = ([RS - RC]/[RT
-RC]) X 100, where RS represents the counts per 4 min
in the bottom filter of stimulated chambers, RC the counts
per 4 min in the bottom filter of control chambers, and
RT the counts per 4 min in the 0.5 ml of initial leukocyte
suspension added to each chamber.
Random migration of leukocytes was assessed by elimi￾nating the chemotactic stimulus and utilizing either the
modified Boyden technique with a 4-h incubation or the
[1`Cr]leukocyte assay with a 6-h incubation. In the Boyden
technique, leukocytes were enumerated in 10 hpf from
duplicate chambers, as per the assessment of chemotactic
migration. In the [51Cr]leukocyte assay, the response was
expressed as the mean counts per 4 min in the bottom
filters of duplicate chambers. For either assay, alterations
of random migration by agents which act on the leukocytes
were calculated from the random migration of pretreated
leukocytes after correction for randomii migratiotn of un￾treated cells. The effect of various ag-ents on directed aind
random migration was assessed after preincubation of the
cells with varying dilutions of the agents for 15 min at
37°C.
Erythrophagocytosis. Phagocytosis by human leukocytes
of antibody-sensitized sheep erythrocytes (EA) or EA
coated with the first four complement components (EAC￾1423) was determined as described (12). The percent pha￾gocytosis of the erythrocytes was calculated by subtracting
the optical density (OD) at 414 nm of a 0.84% NH4Cl
lysate of uningested erythrocytes in each phagocytosis mix￾ture from the OD414 of a lysate of the total initial erythro￾cytes and dividing this difference by the latter OD414. The
effect of ascorbate on this process was studied by prein￾cubation for 20 min at 37'C of leukocytes or pturified neu￾trophils with varying dilutions of ascorbate before the
addition of the target erythrocytes; the net percent of
erythrocyte ingestion attributed to ascorbate was calcu￾lated by subtracting the mean percenlt in its absenice.
Aerobic glucose ntetabolic rates of adherent leukocy tes.
Mixed leukocytes or purified neutrophils were allowed to
adhere to plastic Petri dishes by incubation in Hanks's
solution without added protein as described (1). The ad￾herent leukocytes were washed and covered with 1 ml of
Krebs-Ringer phosphate glucose solution (2) made 0.1 g
per 100 ml in ovalbumin (KRPG-ovalbumin). The activity
of the HMPS of adherent leukocyte layers was determined
by measuring the extent of conversion of [1-14C]glucose to
14CO2 after 80 min at 37'C (1, 2). The glycolytic activity
of adherent leukocyte layers was assessed by measuiring the
lactate concentration in KRPG-ovalbumin after 3 h at 37°C
with the LDH enzymatic assay (2). Both the cpm of
'4CO2 and the Aug lactate per ml were standardized by
dividing each value by the OD at 280 nm of a 3% SLS
solution of the adherent leukocytes in the same dish. The
resulting activities were expressed as cpm per 0.2 absor￾bancy unitsm,0 (AU) for the HMPS and ,ug lactate/ml per
0.2 AU280 for the glycolytic pathway. The effect of various
agents on these pathways, expressed as net cpm per 0.2
AU28o for the HMPS and net ,g lactate/ml per 0.2 AU280
for glycolysis, was calculated by subtraction of the mean
value for duplicate unchallenged dishes from the corre￾sponding mean value for treated dishes. The effect of such
agents under investigation were studied by preincubation
of these agents with the leukocyte layers for 20 min at
37'C before the addition of chemotactic factors, cold glu￾cose, and [1-1'C]glucose.
RESULTS
Enhancement of leukocyte mobility by ascorbate. Pre￾incubation of human leukocytes with ascorbate resulted
in an augmentation of their random migration (Fig. 1)
and directed leukotaxis in response to the chemotactic
stimuli, C5a (Fig. 1) and kallikrein. Ascorbate was less
effective when present only on the stimulus side of the
micropore filter opposite from the leukocytes, while its
presence in both compartments of the chamber to elimi￾814 E. J. Goetzl, S. I. Wasserman, I. Gigli, and K. F. Austen

FIGURE 1 Enhancement by ascorbate of random migration and chemotactic response by
mixed human leukocytes. The modified Boyden assay was used to assess random migration
and the chemotactic response to C5a of mixed human leukocytes. C5a, produced by tryptic
digestion of C5, was present at a final concentration equivalent to that derived from 10 ,tg
of C5 per ml. The ascorbate concentration was 2.5 X 10" M. Cells were preincubated with
ascorbate and introduced into the chambers without washing (leukocyte side), ascorbate was
placed into the stimulus compartment alone (stimulus side), or these two maneuvers were
combined (both sides).
nate a concentration gradient allowed for a maximum
enhancement of random migration and chemotaxis. The
random migration of purified human neutrophils, eosino￾phils, and mononuclear leukocytes, and the chemotactic
response of these leukocytes to the selective stimuli, kal￾likrein, ECF-A, and C5a, respectively, were each en￾hanced by exposure of the leukocytes to ascorbate (Fig.
2). The capacity of ascorbate to enhance directed and
random migration of neutrophils did not extend to an
effect on erythrophagocytosis (Fig. 3).
Relationship of enhancement of leukocyte mobility by
ascorbate to stimulation of HMPS activity. The ac￾tivity of the HMPS of neutrophils was increased by the
addition of ascorbate, with a dose-response relationship
comparable to that found for the stimulation by ascorbate
of random mobility (Fig. 3). The stimulation of both
random migration and the activity of the HMPS of hu￾man leukocytes by two concentrations of ascorbate fall￾ing on the plateau of the dose-response curve was par￾tially reversible with washing of the cells (Table I).
The augmentation of the activity of the HMPS by as￾corbate alone or in combination with C5a was greater
than 90% reversible by washing the leukocytes. The en￾hanced random migration by ascorbate was also largely
reversible upon washing of the leukocytes, while the en￾hancement of directed migration was only partially re￾versed by washing. The action of ascorbate was not
unique, since glutathione which also stimulated HMPS
activity enhanced random migration and chemotaxis of
human leukocytes with similar dose-response patterns
(Fig. 4). Methylene blue, the most potent agent in terms
of HMPS stimulation, had no effect on migration, and
therefore, HMPS stimulation was not alone sufficient to
enhance migration.
Inhibition of the ascorbate effect on leukocyte mo￾bility. Prior incubation of neutrophils with either
6-aminonicotinamide, which blocks HMPS activity by
competing with NADP+ (13), or low concentrations of
the alkylating agent iodoacetate resulted in concomitant
inhibition of enhanced HMPS activity and random mi￾gration (Table II). These doses did not affect base-line
glycolytic activity, which was also not influenced by
ascorbate. In contrast, NIF, which specifically inhibits
both random and directed migration of these human
neutrophils, had virtually no effect on the augmentation
of random migration and HMPS activity by ascorbate.
DISCUSSION
Exposure of human peripheral leukocytes to ascorbic
acid at neutral pH increased both the random migration
of the leukocytes and their chemotactic responsiveness
to diverse stimuli by 100-300%, without influencing
their phagocytic capacity (Figs. 1, 3). The effect of
ascorbate in enhancing mobility was not limited to a

left-hand bar represents the effect of the lower concentration. Kallikrein was present at a

leukocytes without ascorbate were 12 and 33 leukocytes per hpf, respectively.

ECF-A, and C5a, respectively. Although ascorbate ex￾hibited this general effect on cell mobility, it did not
enhance phagocytosis of sensitized erythrocytes previ￾ously interacted with the first four complement compo￾nents (Fig. 3).
As ascorbate had been observed to increase the ac￾tivity of the HMPS of human leukocytes (1, 3), the
relationship between this stimulation and the enhanced
mobility produced by ascorbate was examined in terms
of dose-response relationship, reversibility, and the in￾fluence of metabolic inhibitors. The presumed mechanism
of the ascorbate effect was the conversion of ascorbate
to dehydroascorbate, which occurs rapidly and spon￾taneously at neutral pH conditions, followed by, pre￾sumably via the glutathione shuttle, the oxidation of
NADPH by dehydroascorbate to NADP*, the coenzyme
in the rate-limiting initial step of the HMPS (3). The
stimulation of HMPS activity and migration by glu￾tathione (Fig. 4) supports its role as an intermediate
Ascorbate Enhancement of Human Leukocyto MWiity 8817

between dehydroascorbate and NADPH. Ascorbate is
not itself a chemotactic factor, and its action in aug￾menting random and directed mobility is dependent upon
its prior interaction with the leukocytes (Fig. 1).
There is a dose-response relationship between the ef￾fect of ascorbate on HMPS activity and neutrophil
mobility (Fig. 3), and both are reversed by washing
(Table I). In addition, treatment of leukocytes with
6-aminonicotinamide or iodoacetate so as to inhibit
stimulation of the HMPS by ascorbate resulted in com￾plete blockage of enhancement by ascorbate of random
migration (Table II) and chemotaxis. This inhibition
of mobility by 6-aminonicotinamide was more profound
than that previously demonstrated for suppression of
chemotaxis in the absence of ascorbate (2). Thus, al￾though the failure of methylene blue to enhance migra￾tion demonstrates that HMPS stimulation is not alone
sufficient, it appears that ascorbate enhancement of ran￾dom migration and chemotaxis is dependent upon stimu￾lation of HMPS.
Previous work (1, 4) showed that irreversible in￾hibition of human neutrophil directed and random mo￾bility by NIF was not lethal to the cells and was func￾tionally specific, since neither neutrophil phagocytosis
nor adherence to surfaces was altered by NIF. The con￾comitant finding that NIF did not suppress stimulation
of the HMPS during phagocytosis, nor after intro￾duction of a chemotactic factor, (1) has now been ex￾tended to show that NIF does not prevent ascorbate
enhancement of HMPS activity (Table II). In addi￾tion, the failure of NIF to suppress ascorbate augmenta￾tion of mobility contrasts with previous studies (1, 4) in
which this factor rapidly suppressed polymorphonuclear
leukocyte mobility.
It was demonstrated more than two decades ago that
deficiency of ascorbate resulted in impaired phagocyto￾sis by leukocytes, a defect which could be reversed
by the addition of exogenous ascorbate (14). However,
while concentrations of ascorbate 10-50 times the usual
plasma level (15) did not enhance the phagocytic ca￾pacity of human leukocytes (Fig. 3), these concentra￾tions were effective in enhancing leukocyte mobility
in vitro. Human leukocytes, as well as the choroid plexus,
cerebral cortex, kidney, and eye, concentrate ascorbate
to levels comparable to those which were associated with
the augmentation of random and directed leukocyte mo￾bility (16-20). It may well be that the high ascorbate
levels in some tissues contribute to their ability to mount
an inflammatory reaction in response to infection or
other noxious stimuli.
