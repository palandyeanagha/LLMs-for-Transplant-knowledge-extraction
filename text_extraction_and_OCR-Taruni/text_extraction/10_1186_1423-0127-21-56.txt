Abstract
Background: Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) has been documented for its beneficial effects protecting oxidative
stress to cardiac cells. Previously, we have shown the EGCG-mediated cardiac protection by attenuating reactive
oxygen species and cytosolic Ca2+ in cardiac cells during oxidative stress and myocardial ischemia. Here, we aimed
to seek a deeper elucidation of the molecular anti-oxidative capabilities of EGCG in an H2O2-induced oxidative stress
model of myocardial ischemia injury using H9c2 rat cardiomyoblasts.
Results: Proteomics analysis was used to determine the differential expression of proteins in H9c2 cells cultured in
the conditions of control, 400 μM H2O2 exposure for 30 min with and/or without 10 to 20 μM EGCG pre-treatment.
In this model, eight proteins associated with energy metabolism, mitochondrial electron transfer, redox regulation,
signal transduction, and RNA binding were identified to take part in EGCG-ameliorating H2O2-induced injury in
H9c2 cells. H2O2 exposure increased oxidative stress evidenced by increases in reactive oxygen species and cytosolic
Ca2+ overload, increases in glycolytic protein, α-enolase, decreases in antioxidant protein, peroxiredoxin-4, as well as
decreases in mitochondrial proteins, including aldehyde dehydrogenase-2, ornithine aminotransferase, and succinate
dehydrogenase ubiquinone flavoprotein subunit. All of these effects were reversed by EGCG pre-treatment. In addition,
EGCG attenuated the H2O2-induced increases of Type II inositol 3, 4-bisphosphate 4-phosphatase and relieved its
subsequent inhibition of the downstream signalling for Akt and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β)/cyclin D1 in
H9c2 cells. Pre-treatment with EGCG or GSK-3β inhibitor (SB 216763) significantly improved the H2O2-induced
suppression on cell viability, phosphorylation of pAkt (S473) and pGSK-3β (S9), and level of cyclin D1 in cells.
Conclusions: Collectively, these findings suggest that EGCG blunts the H2O2-induced oxidative effect on the Akt
activity through the modulation of PIP3 synthesis leading to the subsequent inactivation of GSK-3β mediated
cardiac cell injury.

Background
Oxidative stress has been associated with hypoxia or myo￾cardial ischemia, and likely contributes to the progression
of cardiovascular diseases [1]. Accumulating evidence also
indicates that redox-sensitive signalling pathways via the
effects of generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) or
reactive nitrogen species (RNS) or reactive lipid derived al￾dehydes (LDAs) are essentially involved in the pathological
stress of heart cells [2]. Accordingly, molecular targeting
for anti-oxidative interventions on redox signalling path￾ways may provide a therapeutic approach to ameliorate
the risk and progression for heart diseases.
Myocardial ischemia injury involving brief regional is￾chemia followed by prolonged reperfusion (IR) is the re￾sult of an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply
and demand [3]. Such myocardial ischemia stress can
cause oxidative stress in myocardium, in which the dimin￾ished cellular antioxidant defence system accompanied by
the increased ROS production triggers the irreversible cell
death [4-6]. However, the detailed mechanism of ROS￾induced cardiac cell death during myocardial IR injury re￾mains to be determined. A cell line of H9c2 rat cardio￾myoblasts treated with H2O2 has been used as an in vitro
cellular model for cardiac tissues in response to oxidative
stress associated with heart IR injury [7-11]. Using this
H2O2-induced oxidative stress model, several studies using
proteomics analyses have been reported to identify target
proteins associated with oxidative stress with or without
antioxidant intervention [7-9].
Green tea polyphenols (GTPs), including epicatechin
(EC), epigallocatechin (EGC), epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG),
and epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), have potent prop￾erties of antioxidant and radical-scavenger, which may par￾tially account for their anti-atherogenic effects [12-14].
EGCG is the most physiologically potent compound, and
predominantly accounts for the biological effects of green
tea [15]. Although studies have provided convincing evi￾dence to support the cardioprotective effects of GTPs, the
end effectors that mediate cardiac protection are only be￾ginning to be addressed.
The present study aimed to seek a deeper elucidation
of the potential proteins for the EGCG-mediated cardi￾oprotection against the H2O2-induced oxidative stress in
H9c2 rat cardiomyoblasts by using a proteomics study.
Differential protein expression in control cells with or
without treatment were distinguished by two-dimensional
electrophoresis (2-DE). After image analysis, the proteins
were co-detected, normalized, and quantified. Protein
spots cutting off with 1.5 fold difference were selected for
protein identification with matrix-assisted laser desorption
ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF
MS) by peptide mass fingerprinting. The proteins identi￾fied were then used to generate an interaction map and to
establish interaction networks. Based on the hypothetical
model with interaction networks, the present study pro￾posed a putative mechanism for EGCG-induced antioxi￾dant intervention on the H2O2-induced oxidative stress in
H9c2 cells.
Methods
Chemicals and reagents
H9c2 cell lines were purchased from American Type Cul￾ture Collection (ATCC, CRL-1446) (Rockville, MD). All
reagents used were ACS or MB grade. EGCG, purchased
from Sigma, was prepared as a stock solution of 10 mM
by dissolving the compound in deionized water.
Cell culture, EGCG and/or H2O2 treatments, MTT assay
H9c2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified essential
medium (DMEM, Gibco, Invitrogen Taiwan Ltd., Taipei,
Taiwan) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco),
25 mM D-glucose, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyru￾vate, 1% streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (Gibco), and 1% penicil￾lin (100 U/ml) (Gibco) at pH 7.4 in a 5% CO2 incubator at
37°C. Cell viability was measured using the MTT (3-(4, 5-
dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) cell
proliferation assay (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). Cells (105
)
were seeded onto 6-cm plates in DMEM-10% FBS. After
adhering overnight, the cells were changed to serum-free
medium with or without EGCG for 30 min in a 5% CO2 in￾cubator at 37°C and then washed with phosphate buffer so￾lution (PBS). The washed cells were treated with different
concentrations of H2O2 in serum-free DMEM for 30 min
in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C. After washing with PBS,
the cells were incubated in serum-free DMEM for 24 h in a
5% CO2 incubator at 37°C. After 24 h incubation, MTT
was then added to the cells at a final concentration of
0.5 mg/ml and the mixture was incubated at 37°C for
4 hours. The optical density of the purple MTT formazan
product was measured at 570 nm using a microplate
reader.
Determination of cellular Ca2+ levels
Fura 2-AM (fura 2-tetra-acetoxymethyl ester; Molecular
Probes, Eugene, OR) was used as the fluorescent indicator.
H9c2 cells were dissolved in PBS containing 2 mM fura 2-
AM and incubated for 45 min at room temperature and
then for 30 min at 37°C, during which time the fura 2-AM
was trapped inside by esterase cleavage. The cells were then
washed twice with PBS and diluted to a density of 2×106
cells/ml in PBS. Recordings were made in a Perkin-Elmer
LS 50B spectrofluorimeter equipped with an accessory to
measure Ca2+ (Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, England).
The dye trapped inside the cells was excited every second
by exposure to alternating 340 and 380 nm light beams and
the intensity of light emission at 510 nm was measured,
allowing the monitoring of both the light intensity and the
340 nm fluorescence/380 nm ratio (F340/F380). EGCG was

added to the cuvette using a minimum 100-fold concen￾trated stock solution to avoid large volume variations [16].
The 340/380 ratio (R) was calculated and converted to the
corresponding levels of [Ca2+]i as described by Grynkiewicz
et al. [17], using a Kd of 0.14 μM:
Ca2þ  
i ¼ Kd  ð Þ R‐Rmin =ð Þ Rmax‐R Sf2=Sb2
where Rmin and Rmax are the ratios measured by the re￾lease of intracellular dye with 2 mM EGTA in 0.1% Triton
X-100 (Rmin) followed by the addition of 2.1 mM Ca2+
(Rmax), whereas Sf2/Sb2 is the ratio of the 380 nm signals
in Ca2+-free and Ca2+-replete solutions, respectively.
Measurement of intracellular ROS generation by
fluorescence spectrophotometry
Intracellular ROS levels were assessed using 2’, 7’-dichloro￾fluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) [18]. Cells (1.2 × 106
)
loaded with DCF-DA in 3 ml PBS at a final concentration
of 10 μM were incubated at 37°C for 1 h. After incubation,
the cells were then washed three times with PBS by centri￾fugation at 300 × g at 4°C for 5 min. The cells re￾suspended with PBS and brought to a density of 105 cells/
ml were measured for DCF-DA fluorescence changes
every 10 min after the addition of H2O2 or EGCG by
fluorescence spectrophotometry. The fluorescence excita￾tion maximum for DCF-DA was 495 nm, and the corre￾sponding emission maximum was 527 nm.
Sample preparation and two-dimensional electrophoresis
After treatment, the cells were washed twice with cold
PBS and lysed in 2-DE lysis buffer containing 7 M urea,
2 M thiourea, 4% (w/v) 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethy￾lammonio]-1-propane sulfonate, 2% immobilized pH gra￾dient (IPG) buffer (GE Healthcare UK Ltd., England) and
40 mM DTT. Protein concentration was determined by
Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) according to manu￾facturer’s procedure. Immobilized nonlinear pH gradient
strips (pH 4–7, 24 cm) were rehydrated with 450 μg pro￾tein at room temperature overnight (at least 12 h). Isoelec￾tric focusing was then performed using an Ettan
IPGphor 3 instrument (GE Healthcare) for a total of 60
kVh at 20°C. After isoelectric focusing, strips were
equilibrated in 6 M urea, 75 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.8),
29.3% (v/v) glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS and 0.002% (w/v)
bromophenol blue with 1% (w/v) DTT for 15 min and
then in the same buffer containing 2.5% (w/v) iodoace￾tamide for 15 min. The equilibrated IPG strips were
transferred onto 10% polyacrylamide gels and sealed
with 0.5% (w/v) low-melting-point agarose in SDS run￾ning buffer containing 0.02% (w/v) bromophenol blue.
The gels were run in an Ettan DALTsix electrophoresis
system (GE Healthcare) at 40 mA per gel at 20°C until
the dye reached the bottom of the gels.
Gels staining, image analysis and MALDI-TOF MS analysis
After the electrophoresis, gels were stained with Bio-safe™
Coomassie G-250 Stain (Bio-Rad) according to the manu￾facturer’s protocol. Then, stained gels were scanned with
Scanmaker 9800XL (Microtek) using a resolution of 300
dpi. Spot detection, gel matching, and spot quantification
were performed by using ImageMaster™ 2D Platinum 7.0
(GE healthcare). The criteria used for selection of candidate
protein spots were: (1) the protein spots with >1.5-fold in￾creased or decreased intensity between H2O2 group and
control group (Ctrl.), and (2) the protein spots with >1.5-
fold recovery between EGCG + H2O2 group and H2O2
group. The proteins of interest were then excised, destained,
dehydrated and in-gel digested with trypsin. The resulting
peptides were concentrated using Zip-Tip C18 (Millipore).
1 μ1 of peptide was mixed with 1 μ1 of matrix solution (α￾cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, 5 mg/mL in 50% (v/v)
acetonitrile/0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid), spotted onto a
target plate and subjected to mass spectrometer. The mass
fingerprint search was using the MASCOT search engine
(Matrix Science, London, UK; http://www.matrixscience.
com) against SwissPort/TrEMBL database. The parameters
used for searching were: Rattus; allow one missed cleavage
by trypsin; carbamidomethylation of cysteine, partial me￾thionine oxidation and mass tolerance of 100 ppm. Proteins
identification was based on MASCOT Mowse scores (p <
0.05) and the calculated MW and pI had to be in common
with the observed MW and pI on 2-DE.
Real-time polymerase chain reaction
Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol® Reagent (Invitro￾gen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For reverse
transcription, 2 μg of total RNA was used for reverse tran￾scription with Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus Reverse
Transcriptase (M-MLV-RT) (Genemark) using oligo-dT.
Samples were run in triplicate using the SYBR qPCR Kit
(Genemark) and the ABI Prism 7300 Sequence Detection
System and software (Applied Biosystems). The primers
used for qPCR were listed in Table 1.
Western blot analysis
After treatment, the cells were washed twice with cold PBS
and lysed in cell lysis buffer containing 20 mM Tris–HCl
(pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM phenyl￾methanesulfonyl fluoride, 2 mM 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzene￾sulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 0.3 μM aprotinin, 130 μM
bestatin, 14 μM proteinase inhibitor E-64, 1 mM EDTA,
1 μM leupetin and 1% phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 2/3
(Sigma). Protein concentration was determined by Bradford
protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). One hundred microgram of
samples were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE gels and then
transferred onto a PVDF membrane. The immuo-blotting
procedure was as described previously [11]. The mem￾branes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA)

and incubated with anti-Inpp4b (Santa Cruz; 1: 1000 dilu￾tion), anti-phospho-AKT (Ser473) (Sigma, 1: 500 dilution),
anti-phospho-AKT (Thr308) (Santa Cruz, 1: 500 dilution),
anti-phospho-GSK-3β (Ser9) (Santa Cruz; 1: 1000 dilution),
anti-cyclin D1 (Santa Cruz; 1: 1000 dilution) and anti￾GAPDH antibody (Santa Cruz; 1: 1000 dilution), followed
by incubation with AP-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti￾mouse IgG secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz; 1:5000). Pro￾teins specifically recognized by the antibody were visualized
using the 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate-nitro blue
tetrazolium substrate kit (invitrogen). Band intensities were
quantified using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad).
Measurements of Aldh activity
Aldh activity was measured at 25°C in 33 mM sodium
pyrophosphate containing 0.8 mM NAD+
, 15 μM pro￾pionaldehyde and 0.1 ml of cellular extract (50 μg sol￾uble protein). Propionaldehyde, the substrate of Aldh,
was oxidized into propionic acid by Aldh, while NAD+
was reduced to NADH to quantitatively indicate the
Aldh activity. Production of NADH was determined by
spectrophotometric absorbance at 340 nm. Aldh activity
was expressed as nmol NADH/min per mg protein. An
extinction coefficient of 6.22/mM per cm for NADH
was used for the calculation of reaction rates [19].
Statistical analysis
Excel 2013 (Microsoft office) was used to perform stat￾istical analyses. Quantitative values are presented as
mean ± standard error (mean ± SEM). Statistical sig￾nificance between more than two groups was tested
using one-way ANOVA, while comparisons between
two groups were performed using Student’s t test. Dif￾ferences were considered to be statistically significant
when p < 0.05 or less.
Results
The proteomic strategy used to evaluate EGCG-mediated
cardioprotection against H2O2-induced oxidative stress in
H9c2 rat cardiomyoblasts
In this study, H2O2 treatment of H9c2 rat cardiomyocytes
was used as a model for oxidative stress associated with
heart IR injury. Upon H2O2 treatment from 0 to 1000 μM
for 30 min, a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability oc￾curred in H9c2 cells with a 50% decrease of cell viability oc￾curred at 400 μM H2O2 (Figure 1a). On the other hand, the
toxicity of EGCG yielding 50% cell death for H9c2 cells was
found to appear at 50 μM (Figure 1b). EGCG pre￾treatment with 10 or 20 μM for 30 min effectively improved
viability of cells in prior to their exposure to 400 μM H2O2
(Figure 1c). To understand further the molecular events for
EGCG-mediated anti-oxidative intervention on the H2O2-
induced oxidative stress, H9c2 cells cultured in the medium
of control, 400 μM H2O2 with or without 20 μM EGCG
pre-treatment (Figure 1d) were used to differentiate their
protein expression profile by 2-DE analyses (Figure 1e).

among three conditions (Figure 2a). In order to under￾stand H9c2 cells in response to H2O2-induced oxidative
stress and EGCG-mediated antioxidant interventions, the
criteria setting with >1.5-fold increased or decreased in￾tensity between H2O2 group and control group, and >1.5-
fold recovery between EGCG pretreatment group and
H2O2 group were used to select candidate protein spots
on the 2-DE gels. According to the thresholded settings,
8 protein spots confirmed by three-dimensional image
analysis (Figure 2b) were selected for protein identifica￾tion with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry by peptide
mass fingerprinting (Figure 3a). Identified proteins were
listed in Table 2. To establish a hypothetical model for inter￾action networks, the proteins identified were imported
into the EMBL Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interact￾ing Proteins (STRING) database (http://string-db.org/)
to generate an interaction map (Figure 3b). According
to functionally annotations derived from the reported
database, these differentially expressed proteins are impli￾cated in cellular energetic metabolism, including: α-enolase
(Eno1), aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (Aldh2), and ornithine
aminotransferase (Oat), mitochondrial electron transfer, i.e.
succinate dehydrogenase ubiquinone flavoprotein subunit
(Sdha), redox regulation, i.e. peroxiredoxin-4 (Prdx4), Akt

signal transduction, i.e. Type II inositol 3,4-bisphosphate
4-phosphatase (Inpp4b), RNA binding, i.e. heterogeneous
nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (HnRNP K) and Staufen
homolog 2 (Stau2) (Table 2).
Effects of H2O2 and EGCG on oxidative stress associated
with cellular metabolism
H2O2 exposure increased oxidative stress in H9c2 cells, evi￾denced by increases in ROS and cytosolic Ca2+ overload
(Figure 4a). In addition, H2O2 exposure decreased the pro￾tein level but not mRNA expression for antioxidant protein,
i.e. Prdx4, in H9c2 cells; whereas, EGCG pretreatment
prevented the decrease of the protein level without effect
on the mRNA expression for Prdx4 in H2O2-treated cells
(Figure 4b). When H9c2 cells were treated with H2O2, the
protein level of glycolytic protein, Eno1, was increased with
its decreased mRNA expression in cells (Figure 4b). EGCG
pretreatment reversed the H2O2-decreased protein level
with no effect on the mRNA expression for Eno1 in the
H2O2-treated cells (Figure 4c). In contrast, mitochondrial
proteins involved in aerobic energy production, including
Aldh2, Oat, and Sdha were decreased in H9c2 cells with the
H2O2-induced oxidative stress, but not changed in the
H2O2-treated cells with EGCG pretreatment, as compared
to cells in the control condition (Figure 4d). For these mito￾chondrial proteins, only Aldh2 mRNA expression was de￾creased by H2O2-induced oxidative stress but recovered by
EGCG pretreatment (Figure 4d). In addition, total cellular
Aldh activity (nmole/min/mg protein) was measured as
377.6 ± 26.0, 217.0 ± 21.1, and 301.5 ± 18.7 in H9c2 cells
under the conditions of control, H2O2 treatment with and
without EGCG, respectively (Figure 4e). These results sug￾gested that under the H2O2-induced oxidative stress, H9c2
cells undergo the inflicted cellular changes of energy pro￾duction by switching aerobic metabolism to anaerobic me￾tabolism. Moreover, EGCG pretreatment could induce
antioxidant intervention and protect cardiac cells from the
H2O2-induced oxidative stress.
Effects of H2O2 and EGCG on PI3K/Akt/GSK3β signaling
pathway
Inpp4b, one of the enzymes involved in membrane phos￾phatidylinositol (PI) metabolism, has been shown to act as
one of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors for the
subsequent activation of Akt prosurvival signalling pathway
[20-22]. In the present study, Inpp4b protein level and
mRNA expression were increased when cells were exposed
to H2O2 (Figure 5a). Concomitantly, the levels of phosphor￾ylated Akt (S473), phosphorylated GSK-3b (S9), and cyclin
D1 were decreased in H2O2-treated cells (Figure 5b). This
result is consistent with the finding that oxidative stress
regulates the activity of the cell survival factor Akt through
the regulation of PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2 synthesis [23].
In addition, EGCG pretreatment counteracted the H2O2-
increased Inpp4b expression in H9c2 cells (Figure 5a).
Recently, we have shown that the Akt prosurvival path￾way associated with glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β)
signalling takes part in EGCG-mediated cardoioprotection
in an H2O2-induced H9c2 cell injury [11]. Consistently,
immunoblot analyses showed that EGCG attenuated the
H2O2-induced increases Inpp4b and relieved its subsequent
inhibition of the downstream signalling for Akt and GSK￾3β/cyclin D1 in H9c2 cells (Figure 5b). Pre-treatment with
EGCG or GSK-3β inhibitor (SB 216763) significantly
improved the H2O2-induced suppression on cell viability

Figure 6 shows effects of H2O2 and EGCG on the
Thr308 (T308) phosphorylation of Akt in H9c2 cells. In
contrast to Akt phosphorylation at S473, H2O2 exposure
significantly increased Akt phosphorylation at T308 in
H9c2 cells. With EGCG pretreatment, T308 phosphoryl￾ation was suppressed by 20% in H2O2-treated H9c2 cells.
Discussion
Previously, we have demonstrated the cardio-protection of
green tea polyphenols (GTPs) against oxidative stress
associated with myocardial ischemic injury by reducing
cytosolic Ca2+ overload and generation of ROS via the Akt/
GSK-3β/β-catenine and caveolae signaling in a rat surgical
model of myocardial ischemia and in an H2O2-induced oxi￾dative stress model of H9c2 rat cardiomyoblasts [11,24-26].
In the present study, using the H9c2 cell model of H2O2-
induced oxidative stress for a proteomics study (Figures 1, 2),
we identified proteins involved in energy metabolism,
mitochondrial electron transfer, redox regulation, signal
transduction, and RNA binding that might take part in
EGCG-ameliorating H2O2-induced injury in H9c2 cells
(Figure 3, Table 2).

During hypoxia or ischemia, ATP depletion impairs
the Ca2+ uptake capacity of the sarcoplasmic reticulum
(SR), leading to intracellular Ca2+ accumulation [27]. The
rise in Ca2+ leads to mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation,
particularly during reperfusion when oxygen is reintroduced.
Reintroduction of oxygen causing damage to the electron
transport chain results in increased mitochondrial gener￾ation of ROS [27]. Both mitochondrial Ca2+ overload and
increased ROS can result in opening of the mitochondrial
permeability transition pore, which further compromises
cellular energetics [28]. In this study, not only increasing
ROS formation and cytosolic Ca2+ overload (Figure 4a),
H2O2 exposure also resulted in decreasing the level of anti￾oxidant, Prox4 in H9c2 cells (Figure 4b) as well as altering
the expression for cellular energy production by decreasing
the expression for mitochondrial metabolism (i.e. Aldh2,
Oat, and Sdha) (Figure 4c) but increasing the expression for
glycolytic metabolism (i.e. Eno1) (Figure 4d). Apparently,
oxidative stress strongly correlates with mitochondrial dys￾function and likely contributes to the decline in mitochon￾drial bioenergetics [29]. Moreover, the activity of ALDH was
found to decrease significantly in the H2O2-treated H9c2
cells (Figure 4e). This might suggest that excessive ROS
leading to the formation of potentially toxic aldehydes in￾duces inactivation of Aldh2 such as to impair the cardiac
functions [30]. The present study also showed that EGCG
pretreatment prevented the decrease of antioxidant, Prdx4
in H2O2-treated H9c2 cells (Figure 4b), and avoided the
H2O2-decreased mitochondrial proteins (Figure 4c) with
-increased glycolytic protein, Eno1 (Figure 4d), as well as
ameliorated the Aldh2 activity during the H2O2-induced
oxidative stress (Figure 4e). Consistently, a study with
cultured rat cardiomyocytes exposed to different periods of
hypoxia (H), followed by reoxygenation (R), demonstrated
that GTPs acts to counteract the H/R damage-induced
switch to the biosynthesis of highly unsaturated fatty acids
[31], pointing out the importance of GTPs in providing
good antioxidant defence not only after, but mainly prior to,
the onset of H [31].
It has been shown that oxidative stress induced the
PI3K/Akt dependent apoptosis in cardiac cells [32,33].
PI3K produces two lipid products that PI(3,4,5)P3 con￾tributes predominantly to Thr308 (T308) phosphoryl￾ation and membrane-associated activation of Akt, but
PI(3,4)P2 contributes mostly to Ser473 (S473) phos￾phorylation and cytoplasmic activation of Akt [34]. In
this study, the H2O2-increased Inpp4b in concomitant
with the decrease in protein levels of phosphorylated
Akt (S473), phosphorylated GSK-3β (S9), and cyclin D1
appeared in H9c2 cells (Figure 5). This result might also
suggest that the H2O2-induced oxidative stress caused
to decrease the level of PI(3,4)P2 for turning on activation
of cytosolic Akt phosphorylation at S473 such as to relieve
the subsequent inhibition on the downstream target of
GSK-3β/cyclin D1 in H9c2 cells (Figure 5). It has been
shown that GSK-3 inhibition limits myocardial IR injury
and stimulates glycogen synthesis, repartitions glucose
away from glycolysis, reduces proton production from
glucose metabolism, and attenuates intracellular Ca2+
overload [35]. Moreover, several studies have shown that
H2O2-induced oxidative stress can trigger T308 phosphor￾ylation for membrane-associated activation of Akt, by
the PI3K dependent pathway in lymphocytes [36-38]. The
present study also indicated that H2O2 exposure modu￾lates the PI3K signalling events for Akt phosphorylation at
T308 in H9c2 cells, and this Akt phosphorylation at T308
is partly suppressed by EGCG pretreatment (Figure 6).
The present study using cardiac proteomic analysis has
identified EGCG-induced cardio-protection against H2O2-
induced oxidative stress through the Akt/GSK-3β pathway
in cultured H9c2 cells. However, the limitation of this study
was to identify the modified target proteins associated with
anti-oxidative effect of EGCG. The future work using redox
proteomics might further help identify and quantify
EGCG-mediated changes within the proteome both in
redox signaling and under oxidative stress conditions.
Conclusions
In summary, the results obtained with proteomic ana￾lyses that EGCG blunts the H2O2-induced oxidative ef￾fect on the Akt activity through the modulation of PI
(3,4)P2 and PI (3,4,5)P3 synthesis leading to the subse￾quent inhibition of GSK-3β mediated cardiac cell injury.
