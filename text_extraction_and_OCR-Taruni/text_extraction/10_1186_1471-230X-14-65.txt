abnormalities and post-transplant cardiac events
in patients with liver cirrhosis

Abstract
Background: Although cardiovascular disease is thouht to be common in cirrhosis, there are no systematic
investigations on the prevalence of electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities in these patients and data on the
occurrence of post-transplant cardiac events in comparison with the general population are lacking. We aimed
to study the prevalence and predictors of ECG abnormalities in patients with cirrhosis undergoing liver transplantation
and to define the risk of cardiac events post-transplant compared to the general population.
Methods: Cirrhotic patients undergoing first-time liver transplantation between 1999–2007 were retrospectively
enrolled. ECGs at pre-transplant evaluation were reviewed using the Minnesota classification and compared to healthy
controls. Standardized incidence ratios for post-transplant cardiac events were calculated.
Results: 234 patients with cirrhosis were included, 186 with an available ECG (36% with alcoholic and 24% with viral
cirrhosis; mean follow-up 4 years). Cirrhotics had a prolonged QTc interval, a Q wave, abnormal QRS axis deviation,
ST segment depression and a pathologic T wave more frequently compared to controls (p < 0.05 for all). Arterial
hypertension, older age, cirrhosis severity and etiology were related to ECG abnormalities. Compared to the general
Swedish population, patients were 14 times more likely to suffer a cardiac event post-transplant (p < 0.001). A
prolonged QTc interval and Q wave were related to post-transplant cardiac events (p < 0.05 for all).
Conclusions: Pre-transplant ECG abnormalities are common in cirrhosis and are associated with cardiovascular risk
factors and cirrhosis severity and etiology. Post-transplant cardiac events are more common than in the general
population.

Background
Certain electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities have been
reported to occur frequently in patients with cirrhosis,
particularly prolonged QT interval [1,2], dys-synchronous
electrical and mechanical systole [3], decreased heart rate
variability [1] and increased QT dispersion [4-6]. Although
several studies have investigated the presence and clinical
significance of a prolonged QTc interval in cirrhosis
[1,4,7,8], to date, there has been no systematic investiga￾tion of the prevalence of other ECG abnormalities in these
patients. Furthermore, it is unknown whether specific
pre-transplant ECG abnormalities are related to cardiac
morbidity and mortality post-transplant.
Cardiac events have been reported to be common fol￾lowing liver transplantation and constitute important
causes of post-transplant morbidity and mortality [9-12].
However, data on the risk of cardiac events in patients
with liver cirrhosis following liver transplantation com￾pared to the general population are largely lacking.
Our primary aims were to study the prevalence and
predictors of pre-transplant ECG abnormalities in patients
with cirrhosis. Secondary aims were to define the risk for
cardiac events in liver transplant recipients in relation to
the general population and the potential relation of pre-

transplant ECG abnormalities to post-transplant cardiac
morbidity and mortality.
Methods
Patients
This was a retrospective cohort study. All patients with
liver cirrhosis undergoing first-time liver transplantation
between 1999 and 2007 at our Institution were identified
through the Nordic Liver Transplant Registry. Exclusion
criteria were age < 18 yr, acute liver failure, multi-visceral
transplantation or liver transplantation for indications
other than cirrhosis or its complications. This cohort
has been previously used in a report on peri-transplant
heart heart failure [13]. The study protocol was approved
by the regional ethical committee of Västra Götaland.
Baseline clinical data
Patient data, such as etiology and complications of liver
cirrhosis, and comorbid illness, were collected from
medical records. Previous diagnosis of heart disease and
risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) were also
collected from medical records. These included data
regarding diabetes mellitus, history of arterial hyperten￾sion, smoking habits, and hereditary predisposition for
CAD (any first degree relative with coronary artery
disease, 55 years or younger for male and 60 years or youn￾ger for female relative). The results of any pre-transplant
test for CAD were also registered. In our transplant
program pre-transplant testing for CAD is conducted in all
patients who had several risk factors for CAD (such
as age > 50 years, smoking, arterial hypertension, dia￾betes mellitus, family history of CAD) and/or when clinical
suspicion of CAD was present (eg suspicion of angina pec￾toris, history of atherosclerotic disease such as stroke, etc.).
Patients were tested primarily by means of myocardial
scintigraphy (or, more rarely, stress echocardiography or
treadmill exercise test depending on availability and if
considered fit for one), followed by coronary angiography
in the event of positive findings. A patient was classified as
having CAD if they had previously been diagnosed with
myocardial infarction, heart failure due to ischemia, un￾stable angina pectoris or if they had ever had any positive
test for CAD, such as coronary angiography, exercise
test, myocardial scintigraphy, or stress echocardiography.
Weight and height were measured at pre-transplant evalu￾ation and body mass index (BMI) was calculated. Patients
with a BMI > 25 kg/m2 were considered overweight and
those with a BMI > 30 kg/m2 were considered obese [14].
Liver disease severity was assessed by means of the
Child-Pugh classification and the Model for end-stage
liver disease (MELD) score. At pre-transplant evaluation,
all patients were evaluated for ascites, using transabdom￾inal ultrasonography, varices by esophagogastroduodeno￾scopy, and encephalopathy by an experienced hepatologist.
Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was routinely assessed at
pre-transplant evaluation by means of 51Cr-EDTA clear￾ance measurement.
ECG analysis
All available baseline electrocardiograms, routinely ob￾tained at pre-transplant evaluation (mean time on trans￾plant list was 2 months, range 0–14), were reviewed by
two of the investigators (AJ and MF), without knowledge
of the clinical characteristics of the patients. ECGs were
analysed according to the Minnesota code for resting
electrocardiograms [15], consisting of nine domains: the
presence of a Q wave, QRS axis deviation, high-amplitude
R waves, ST segment depression, T wave abnormalities,
A-V conduction defects, ventricular conduction defects,
arrhythmias and a miscellaneous items domain (including
low QRS amplitude, ST segment elevation, pathologic
QRS transition zone and high P or T wave). The Q-T
interval was also manually assessed and corrected accord￾ing to the Bazett formula (QTc = QT time/√RR interval
[16]). The QT interval was measured in a lead free of
noise and arrhythmic beats. QTc ≥ 440 ms was classified
as prolonged [7]. An ECG was considered to be positive
for CAD if Q wave, ST segment depression and/or a
pathologic T wave was present [17,18]. All ECG features
were analysed only if the ECG was considered to be of
sufficient quality to be interpreted.
A control group of individuals with similar age and
gender distribution to the group of patients with an
available pre-transplant ECG was used for comparison
of the prevalence of ECG abnormalities. Controls were
enrolled mainly among hospital staff and relatives. None
of the controls had a medical history and, in particular,
all denied a diagnosis of CAD or liver disease. All the
controls had normal liver tests.
Follow-up
The follow-up period began at the date of liver trans￾plantation and ended at the date of death or last day of
follow-up until December 31, 2009. Three different end￾points were assessed: [1] Date and cause-specific deaths
obtained from the National Cause of Death Registry in
Sweden (updated until December 31, 2009); [2] Post￾transplant cardiac events occurring outside our Institution
acquired through the national in- and out-patient diag￾nosis registry (updated until December 31, 2009) and
through regular correspondence between our Institution
and local referring hospitals; and [3] All cardiac or other
events prior to and during the peri-transplant period
through follow-up to last in- or out- patient episode until
December 31, 2009 was obtained from our Institution’s
medical records. Linkage to the registries was possible
through the unique national registration number assigned

to all Swedish residents. No post-transplant follow-up
ECGs were available for review.
Mortality and cardiac events were analyzed from the
date of liver transplantation until last follow up and
labeled either as peri-transplant events, defined as those
occurring during the immediate post-transplant inpatient
period until discharge from hospital; or as late, defined as
those occurring post-hospital discharge until last follow￾up. Peri-transplant and late events together were labeled
as total events. A cardiac event was defined as arrhythmia
(such as atrial flutter/fibrillation, severe brady-arrhythmias
or ventricular arrhythmias), acute coronary syndrome
(ACS) (diagnosed by an attending cardiologist in the im￾mediate inpatient period post-transplant and/or as ICD￾10 codes in the post-discharge period), or sudden cardiac
death/acute circulatory failure. Apart from the timing of
liver transplantation, other factors such as donor age, cold
ischemia time, need for post-transplant dialysis and other
adverse events (such as re-transplantation and infections)
were also registered.
Statistics
Statistics were calculated with SPSS v 17.0 statistics for
windows. Data were expressed as mean and standard devi￾ation (SD) or as n and percentages as appropriate. For
comparison of continuous variables the student’s t-test was
used. For dichotomous variables, the chi square test was
used. Kaplan Meier analysis was performed for survival
and cardiac events occurring after the peri-transplant
period and groups were compared by means of the log￾rank test. In an attempt to define independent predictors
of ECG abnormalities commonly found in patients with
cirrhosis at pre-transplant evaluation, all variables univari￾ately related to each of ECG abnormality at p < 0.1 were
entered into logistic regression analysis. The expected
number of cases used to calculate standardized incidence
ratio (SIR) for post-transplant cardiac events was obtained
by multiplying person-years in the cohort with the corre￾sponding incidence in the entire Swedish population. Data
from the Swedish population were collected from the
national inpatient diagnosis registry maintained by the
Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare (cardiac
events defined as specified above). The national inpatient
diagnosis registry covers virtually all inpatient episodes in
Sweden since 1987, with only about 0.9-1.5% per year of all
ICD-10 code statistics being lost due to insufficient data
submission [19]. Exact confidence intervals of SIRs and p￾values were calculated assuming Poisson-distributed num￾ber of observed cardiac event cases. All statistical tests were
two-sided and were conducted at a 5% significance level.
Results
A total of 234 patients with liver cirrhosis received a liver
transplant during the study period and were included in
the study. Among these, 186 (79%) had had an ECG at
pre-transplant evaluation that was available and of suffi￾cient quality for analysis. These (n = 186) were included in
the ECG part of the study (Table 1). No patient had been

diagnosed with alcoholic cardiomyopathy. Of the patients
in our cohort, not all had an echocardiogram available at
pre-transplant evaluation; in all, 140/186 patients had an
echocardiogram available for review. On echocardiog￾raphy, 6/140 (4%) had a left ventricular rear wall thickness
above the reference value at our hospital, 17/140 (12%)
had a septal thickness above the reference value of our
hospital, 16/140 (11.5%) had an E/A ratio of 1 or less, and
5/140 (3.5%) had a left ventricular ejection fraction below
50% but only 1/140 (0.5%) patient below 40% [13]. Other
cardiovascular conditions had been diagnosed in some
patients prior to pre-transplant evaluation; 4/186 (2%)
patients had been diagnosed with pre-transplant heart
failure, 6 (3%) patients had been diagnosed with atrial
fibrillation or flutter, 1 (0.5%) patient had been diagnosed
with another arrhythmic condition [13]. All explanted
livers were histologically classified as cirrhotic. Patients
were followed up for a mean of 4 (range 0–9) years post￾transplant. No patient underwent any cardiac procedures
after pre-transplant work-up and prior to transplantation.
Prevalence of ECG abnormalities at pre-transplant evalu￾ation (n = 186)
When compared with controls, patients with cirrhosis at
pre-transplant evaluation had more frequently a prolonged
QTc interval, a Q wave, abnormal QRS axis deviation, ST
segment depression, a pathologic T wave and ECG features
compatible with CAD (Table 2).
Predisposing factors for ECG abnormalities
In order to identify clinical parameters independently
related to ECG abnormalities that were significantly
more common in patients with cirrhosis compared to
controls (Table 2), variables (of Table 1) that were univari￾ately related at p < 0.1 with each ECG abnormality were
entered into logistic regression analyses (Table 3). Risk
factors of CAD, such as older age, male gender, smoking,
and a history of arterial hypertension, were found to be
independent predictors of several of ECG abnormalities in
these patients (Table 3). Liver disease severity, as assessed
by the MELD, was associated with any ECG feature of
CAD and Q wave. Cholestatic liver disease was a predictor
of ST segment depression. Viral hepatitis was less com￾mon among patients having ECG findings compatible
with CAD whereas alcoholic liver disease and QT
prolonging drugs were predictors of prolonged QT interval
(Table 3). In all, 15% of patients with ECG features
compatible with CAD had been/were diagnosed with CAD
compared to 5% of patients with no ECG features com￾patible with CAD (p = 0.027). Several echocardiographic
parameters were related to ECG findings in univariate ana￾lysis, however in no case did they improve the multivariate
models shown in Table 3 (p > 0.05 for all in regression
analysis; data not shown). In our cohort 36 patients (15%)
were on a drug reported to be related to QT interval pro￾longation. Serum sodium, potassium and calcium concen￾trations did not differ significantly between patients with
vs. without a prolonged QTc interval in our cohort (data
not shown). Not all patients had an available BMI meas￾urement (142/186) and the prevalence of overweight was
60/142 (42%) and obesity was 25/142 (17.5%). The preva￾lence of obesity and overweight did not differ significantly
between patients with vs. those any pre-transplant ECG ab￾normality (p > 0.05 for all; data not shown).
Incidence of cardiac events following liver transplantation
(n = 234)
In all, 70 cardiac events occurred following liver trans￾plantation. A total of 39/70 (56%) occurred in the peri￾transplant period period whereas 31/70 (44%) were late
events, i.e. occurred after the immediate inpatient post￾transplant period. Some events occurred during surgery
and were included in the peri-transplant events: two pa￾tients had a ventricular tachycardia, one each an episode
of atrial fibrillation, undefined tachyarrythmia, and acute
coronary syndrome. Although the majority of total car￾diac events were arrhythmic -mainly atrial flutter or fib￾rillation, n = 24 (77%), coronary and arrhythmic events
were almost equally common in the late period (Table 4).
Transplanted patients were 14 times more likely to suf￾fer a cardiac event following liver transplantation com￾pared to the general Swedish population. Risks were
increased both for ACS and arrhythmias, but reached
statistical significance only in the former as regards to
late events (Table 4). Neither the occurrence of cardiac
events nor cardiac mortality post-transplant differed sig￾nificantly in patients with NASH/cryptogenic cirrhosis
compared to the rest of the cohort (p > 0.1 both).
Post-transplant outcome of cirrhotic patients with an
available ECG at pre-transplant evaluation (n = 186)
During the follow up period, 48 patients died and 17
had at least one retransplantation (Table 5). Cardiac
events occurred in 54/186 (29%) patients throughout the
entire follow up period and 27/186 (14.5%) had a late
event. Arrhythmias were the most common post￾transplant event type, mainly in the peri-transplant
period (Table 5).
ECG and outcome
The majority of patients suffering a post-transplant car￾diac event had at least one of the ECG abnormalities
mentioned above (37/54, 69%). Total cardiac events were
associated with prolonged QTc time, the presence of a Q
wave and, the presence of any ECG feature compatible
with CAD, but not with QRS axis deviation or ST￾segment depression (Figure 1a-e). The occurrence of
post-transplant ACS and arrhythmias, in particular atrial

interval (log rank test, p = 0.01 and p < 0.001, respect￾ively), the presence of a Q wave (log rank test, p = 0.005
and p = 0.008, respectively), and any feature of CAD on

(p > 0.05 for both).

and the presence of a Q wave (log rank test, p = 0.044)
at pre-transplant evaluation, but not with any other ECG
abnormality (p > 0.05 for all). Six patients died due to a
direct cardiac cause (Table 5). All patients had at least
one pre-transplant ECG abnormality but no single
abnormality was significantly related to the cardiac￾related mortality (data not shown, p > 0.05).
Discussion
In the current study we found an increased incidence of
post-transplant cardiac events in liver transplant recipi￾ents compared to the general population as well as an
increased prevalence of pre-transplant ECG abnormal￾ities. The prevalence of atherosclerosis and CAD have
traditionally been considered to be low among patients
with cirrhosis [10,12,20-27]. However, recent reports
have shown an increased prevalence of cardiovascular
disease in liver cirrhosis in general and those with NASH￾cirrhosis in particular [17,28-31]. Previous studies have

also reported a high prevalence of cardiovascular risk fac￾tors and disease following liver transplantation [11,29,31],
although reports are not unanimous [27,30] and compara￾tive data with the general population are lacking. Our
results show that patients with cirrhosis undergoing liver
transplantation have approximately a 14-fold increased
risk of suffering a cardiac event compared to the general
population. In particular risks for both ACS and arrhyth￾mias (mainly atrial flutter/fibrillation) are increased post￾transplant. Thus, it seems that strict adherence to current
guidelines advocating rigorous pre- and post-transplant
diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular risk factors and
CAD [32] could be of great importance as an attempt to
reduce cardiovascular morbidity in these patients.
ECG abnormalities appear to be common among
patients with liver cirrhosis, as 73% of these patients had
at least one abnormality at the pre-transplant evaluation.
Apart from a prolonged QTc interval, which is known to
occur frequently in cirrhosis [20,33-40], about one fifth
of patients had QRS-axis deviation or findings compat￾ible with the presence of CAD, while a Q wave was
present in approximately one out of ten patients and
ST-segment depression in one out of twenty. Although
our data indicate that most predictors of the presence of
these abnormalities are known risk factors of CAD (such
as smoking, older age, arterial hypertension, and male
gender) [32], liver disease severity, as assessed by the
MELD, was also found to be a predictor of the presence
of a Q wave and ECG findings compatible with CAD.
These findings suggest that at least some of the ECG
abnormalities observed in the current study could po￾tentially be related to cirrhotic cardiomyopathy, which is
often present in cirrhotic patients and may have an im￾pact on transplantation outcome [41,42]. Furthermore, a
prolonged QTc interval was associated with older age
and alcoholic liver disease while propranolol treatment
was a protective factor in line with previously published
data [6,8,37,43]. Not unexpectedly, treatment with po￾tentially QT prolonging drugs (mainly fluoroquinolones
as secondary prophylaxis for spontaneous bacterial peri￾tonitis) was a predictor of a prolonged QTc interval in
our cirrhotic cohort. Fluoroquinolones may positively
affect survival in cirrhosis, in particular following an epi￾sode of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [44,45], and
our findings do not suggest that flouroquinolones should
not be used in these patients.
ECG abnormalities were found to be associated with
patient outcomes following liver transplantation. We
have recently shown that a prolonged QTc interval is a
predictor of peri-transplant heart failure [13] and a pre￾vious report suggests that a prolonged pre-transplant
QTc interval may be linked to lower post-transplant sur￾vival [7]. To our knowledge, the current study is the first
one investigating the potential relation of pre-transplant
ECG findings (including but not limited to a prolonged
QTc interval) with post-transplant cardiac events. A pro￾longed QTc interval was found to be related to post￾transplant atrial arrythmias (occurring mainly in the
peri-transplant period) in line with published data from
non-cirrhotic patients with atrial arrythmias in whom a
prolonged QTc interval appears to be frequent [46,47].
We also found that other ECG abnormalities such as the
presence of a Q wave, may also be related to the occur￾rence of post-transplant cardiac events. The majority of
patients suffering post-transplant cardiac events (69%)
had at least one ECG abnormality. Thus, although in the
current study no definite independent relationship may
be established between pre-transplant ECG abnormal￾ities and post-transplant cardiac events, it is conceivable
that ECG findings could be used to improve patient
selection for pre-transplant evaluation for CAD. How￾ever, further studies are warranted in order to elucidate

the clinical significance and pathophysiology of ECG
abnormalities in patients with cirrhosis.
In a recent paper from our group a prolonged pre￾transplant QTc interval was found to be independent
predictor of peri-transplant heart failure in the same
cohort of patients [13]. Although left-ventricular diastolic
dysfunction was associated with long-term transplant-free
mortality, neither diastolic dysfunction nor any other
echocardiographic abnormality was independently asso￾ciated with peri-transplant heart failure [13]. The only
pre-transplant echocardiographic abnormality that was
more common in patients with vs. those without post￾transplant cardiac events was an enlarged left atrium (50%
vs 22%, p = 0.006), mainly due to its relation to arrythmias,
in particular atrial fibrillation [13]. In the current paper
we have also tried to investigate whether echocar￾diographic abnormalities were in any way related to the
electrocardiographic abnormalities. In univariate analysis,
several parameters were significantly related to some ECG
findings, but in no case were echocardiographic abnor￾malities independently related to ECG abnormalities in
multivariate analysis.

Certain limitations should be taken into consideration
when interpreting the results of the current study. First,
it was conducted retrospectively. Thus, pre-transplant
screening for CAD was not performed in all patients nor
did they all have a pre-transplant ECGs of sufficient
quality available for review while pre-transplant data on
dyslipidemia were not available. Although our data are
in accordance with previous studies reporting a high
occurrence of cardiovascular disease post-transplant
[11,17,42], we cannot exclude that potential pre-transplant
underdiagnosis and/or undertreatment of CAD may have
led to an increased post-transplant incidence of cardiac
events. Our findings would, thus, need to be confirmed
by larger multicenter studies, ideally with a prospective
design. Furthermore our healthy ECG control group had
similar age, gender, smoking status distribution, arterial
blood pressure, and BMI with cirrhotic patients but it was
not matched to the latter with regard to other cardio￾vascular risk factors and there were no ECG controls with
another chronic disease or chosen from the general po￾pulation. Although our data suggest that cardiovascular
risk factors rather than liver cirrhosis per se are likely to
be major determinants of the prevalence of ECG abnor￾malities in these patients, future studies assessing ECG
changes should ideally include a control group with
another chronic disease matched for cardiovascular risk
factors with patients with cirrhosis. Another potential
drawback is that the incidence of post-transplant cardiac
events in cirrhotics was only compared with the general
population. The increased incidence of peri-transplant
cardiac events seen in cirrhotics could potentially be
attributed to the stress of major surgery, and thus not be
related solely to each patient’s cardiovascular status. How￾ever, studies on non-cirrhotic patients undergoing liver
resection surgery have reported an incidence of peri￾transplant cardiac events, ranging between 0.5-4.5%,
[48-50], which is much lower than the occurrence of
peri-transplant cardiac events in our cohort (15.5%),
but it is difficult to compare the results of our patients
with historical data. On the other hand, late events (i.e.
after hospital discharge) occurred after a median of
15 months post-transplant in our cohort, and thus it is
unlikely that they were a direct result of surgery per se.
Therefore comparison with the general Swedish popu￾lation appears relevant for at least late events. Further
studies are clearly needed to fully elucidate the inci￾dence and predictors of cardiac events following liver
transplantation.
Conclusions
In conclusion, patients with liver cirrhosis undergoing
liver transplantation have a profoundly increased risk for
post-transplant cardiac events, regarding both ACS and
arrhythmias. Pre-transplant ECG abnormalities, including,
but not limited to, prolonged QTc interval, are also com￾mon in patients with liver cirrhosis. They are related to
traditional cardiovascular risk factors but also cirrhosis
severity and etiology and they seem to predict post￾transplant mortality and cardiac events.
