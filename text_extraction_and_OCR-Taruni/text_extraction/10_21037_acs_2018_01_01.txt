Transplantation for adult patients with congenital heart disease (ACHD) is a growing clinical endeavor 
in the transplant community. Understanding the results and defining potential high-risk patient subsets 
will allow optimization of patient outcomes. This review summarizes the scope of ACHD transplantation, 
the mechanisms of late ventricular dysfunction, the ACHD population at risk of developing heart failure, 
the indications and potential contraindications for transplant, surgical considerations, and post-transplant 
outcomes. The findings reveal that 3.3% of adult heart transplants occur in ACHD patients. The potential 
mechanisms for the development of late ventricular dysfunction include a morphologic systemic right 
ventricle, altered coronary perfusion, and ventricular noncompaction. The indications for transplant in 
ACHD patients include systemic ventricular failure refractory medical therapy, Fontan patients failing 
from chronic passive pulmonary circulation, and progressive cyanosis leading to functional decline. 
Transplantation in ACHD patients can be quite complex and may require extensive reconstruction of the 
branch pulmonary arteries, systemic veins, or the aorta. Vasoplegia, bleeding, and graft right ventricular 
dysfunction can complicate the immediate post-transplant period. The post-transplant operative mortality 
ranges between 14% and 39%. The majority of early mortality occurs in ACHD patients with univentricular 
congenital heart disease. However, there has been improvement in operative survival in more contemporary 
studies. In conclusion, the experience with cardiac transplantation for ACHD patients with end-stage heart 
failure is growing, and high-risk patient subsets have been defined. Significant strides have been made in 
developing evidence-based guidelines of indications for transplant, and the intraoperative management 
of complex reconstruction has evolved. With proper patient selection, more aggressive use of mechanical 
circulatory support, and earlier referral of patients with failing Fontan physiology, outcomes should continue 
to improve.

Perspective
Introduction
Transplantation for adult patients with congenital heart 
disease (ACHD) is a high-risk proposition. Gaining 
an understanding of which patients will do well with 
transplant and those who will not remains elusive. There 
is, however, a growing number of single institution (1-5) 
and registry based (6,7) studies that attempt to shed light 
on outcomes. These reports provide the foundation 
for evidence-based guidelines to counsel patients and 
families on this growing clinical endeavor in the transplant 
community. The purpose of this review is to provide the 
reader with an understanding of the current expectations 
for ACHD patients being considered for isolated cardiac 
transplantation. Specifically, we will attempt to frame for 
the reader: (I) the scope of ACHD transplantation; (II) 
the mechanisms of late ventricular dysfunction in ACHD 
patients and the population at risk; (III) the indications 
and potential contraindications for transplant; (IV) surgical 
considerations; and (V) post-transplant outcomes.

The scope of ACHD transplantation
Current estimates suggest that nearly 90% of children with 
repaired congenital heart disease survive into adulthood (8). 
Residual anatomic issues from previous repair, arrhythmias, 
and late ventricular dysfunction will put these patients at 
risk for the development of end stage heart failure (2,9,10). 
Heart failure accounts for 26% to 42% of deaths in 
ACHD patients (11,12). As a consequence, the transplant 
community has seen a growing number of referrals and 
heart transplants in ACHD patients. The most recent 
registry report from the International Society of Heart and 
Lung transplantation (ISHLT) indicates that 3.3% of adult 
heart transplants occur in patients with congenital heart 
disease (13). Though this percentage is small relative to non￾ACHD adult heart transplant recipients, this represents a 
40% increase over previous decades dating back to 1999 (14).
Mechanisms of late ventricular dysfunction in 
ACHD patients and at-risk populations 
Any patient who underwent repair of a congenital cardiac 
anomaly as a child, even a relatively simple lesion such as a 
septal defect, can develop heart failure as an adult. There 
are, however, certain diagnoses that are particularly prone 
to the development of late ventricular dysfunction. The 
potential mechanisms for development of late ventricular 
dysfunction in repaired congenital heart disease were 
elucidated in a recent review by Stout and colleagues as a 
consensus statement of the American Heart Association (15). 
A systemic right ventricle is a risk factor for late ventricular 
dysfunction whether it is associated with repaired 
biventricular or palliated univentricular congenital heart 
disease (UCHD). Transposition of the great vessels that 
was repaired by an atrial switch procedure and classic 
repair of congenitally corrected transposition of the great 
vessels (ccTGA) are examples of biventricular circulations 
with a systemic right ventricle (16). The quintessential 
univentricular heart with a systemic right ventricle is 
hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS). 
The mechanisms for systemic right ventricular 
dysfunction include architectural changes such as myocardial 
fiber disarray, myocardial ischemia, and the development of 
myocardial fibrosis (15) (Figure 1). The normal architecture 
of the right ventricle may predispose it to late dysfunction in 
the systemic circulation. In particular, the absence of a middle 
layer of circular muscle fibers as seen in the morphologic left 
ventricle may contribute to the right ventricle’s response to 
increased systemic afterload (15,17). Abnormal myocardial 
fiber orientation has been demonstrated in autopsy specimens 
of patients with tricuspid atresia (18) and in animal models 
of HLHS (19). Finally, ventricular noncompaction may also 
contribute to the development of late ventricular dysfunction. 
Trabecular compaction forms normal myocardium and 
contributes to normal contractile function (20). Ventricular 
noncompaction is more common in patients with congenital 
heart disease (21). If the process of myocardial compaction 
fails embryologically, it is lethal to the murine fetus (22). 
The effectiveness of the systemic right ventricle is also 
hindered by the tricuspid valve being septophilic. This can 
lead to significant tricuspid valve insufficiency when the 
right ventricle changes from a crescent-shaped chamber 
to a rounded one. Also, it is often noted in HLHS that the 
septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve can often be restricted 
in its motion or deficient. The precise interaction of the 
aforementioned structural changes in the development of late 
ventricular dysfunction in ACHD patients remains unclear. 
Besides structural changes, altered coronary perfusion 
may also play a role in the development of systemic right 
ventricular dysfunction. The usual coronary branching and 
perfusion may be inadequate in patients with a systemic 
right ventricle that is hypertrophied and enlarged. This may 
cause flow-demand mismatch (23,24). Myocardial ischemia 
may also be related to increased ventricular wall stress from 
high afterload (25) and coronary anomalies in transposition 
of the great vessels (26). Myocardial fibrosis has been 
demonstrated by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging 
in patients with Tetralogy of Fallot (27), Eisenmenger 
Syndrome (28), staged univentricular palliation (29), 
and those with a systemic right ventricle (30). As a 
consequence, these lesions are prone to the development 
of late arrhythmias and systolic dysfunction. The causative 
mechanism of myocardial fibrosis development is believed

to be myofibroblast activation and subsequent collagen 
production (15). 
Chronic cyanosis, pulmonary vascular disease, 
allosensitization, multiple previous operations, and the 
potential for renal and hepatic failure in Fontan patients (31) 
can present challenges when ACHD patients develop end 
stage heart failure (16). Protein losing enteropathy (PLE) 
is also a significant challenge in patients with failed Fontan 
physiology (32). It can persist for months after transplant 
and complicate recovery significantly. Chronic cyanosis can 
be associated with systemic to pulmonary artery collateral 
vessels that can cause life-threatening hemorrhage at the 
time of transplant as well as a volume load to the heart. 
Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVM) are also 
commonly seen but can be treated with pre-transplant 
vascular coils when not diffuse (16,33). AVMs that persist 
post-transplant may lead to ongoing cyanosis (16). 
Elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is also 
important to know prior to listing because it may put the 
right ventricle at risk of failure post-transplant. A PVR that 
exceeds 4 Wood units has been associated with increased 
transplant mortality in ACHD patients (34). However, 
assessment of PVR can be challenging in the Fontan 
physiology where it may be assumed to be low. Because of 
the challenges in assessing PVR prior to organ implantation, 
varying degrees of right ventricular dysfunction post￾transplant should be anticipated. Ruling out secondary 
causes of elevated PVR such as left heart obstructive 
lesions is also important because there may be a surgical 
solution prior to consideration of cardiac transplantation. 
Univentricular palliation, especially with the neonatal 
Norwood procedure, is additionally associated with a high 
incidence of allosensitization (35). Panel reactive antibody 
levels of greater than 10% have been associated with 
increased mortality and can be managed with pre-transplant 
desensitization protocols (36). The potential causes of 
heart failure in patients with congenital heart disease are 
summarized as follows (15):
 Volume overload resulting from left-to-right shunt 
lesions and valvular regurgitation; 
 Pressure overload resulting from valvular disease and 
other obstructive lesions; 
 Ventricular failure related to intrinsic myocardial 
dysfunction; 
 Pulmonary hypertension caused by CHD lesions, 
ventricular dysfunction, or comorbidities such as 
obstructive sleep apnea; 
 Systemic arterial hypertension resulting from coarctation, 
acquired renal disease, essential hypertension, or 
arteriosclerosis; 
 Coronary artery disease related to CHD, atherosclerosis, 
or comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus; 
 Cyanosis;
 Intractable arrhythmias or pacemaker induced heart 
failure.
Indications for transplant
Life expectancy is one aspect to consider when determining 
indications for moving forward with cardiac transplantation 
in ACHD patients. When the extent of heart failure is 
such that the 1-year survival rate is less than 80%, some 
reports suggest this as an indication for moving forward 
with transplant evaluation (37,38). The American Heart 
Association published consensus guidelines for consideration 
of transplantation in ACHD patients (10,15,38). While it 
is difficult to determine specific prognostic indicators of 
which patients will do well with a transplant and those who 
won’t, the suggested indications for heart transplant are 
summarized as follows:
 Stage D heart failure refractory to medical therapy 
with no benefit from surgical, interventional, or 
electrophysiological intervention;
 Congenital heart disease patients with associated 
near-sudden death or life-threatening arrhythmias 
refractory to all therapeutic modalities;
 Stage C heart failure associated with reactive
pulmonary hypertension and a potential risk of 
developing fixed, irreversible elevation of PVR that 
could preclude heart transplant in the future;
 Fontan patients with PLE and plastic bronchitis;
 Progressive cyanosis leading to functional decline.
Contraindications for transplantation
When considering contraindications to transplantation, 
there are absolute contraindications and relative 
contraindications that are somewhat institution dependent. 
Reported “absolute” contraindications include (39-41):
 PVR more than 4 Wood units; 
 Transpulmonary gradient greater than 12 mmHg;
 Malignancy;
 Infection;
 Non-compliance with medical therapy;
 Drug addiction. 
Relative contraindications include (39):


 Obesity (BMI >30 kg/m2
);
 COPD;
 Severe chronic renal insufficiency (GFR <30 mL/min);
 Diabetes with severe peripheral vascular disease;
 Tobacco use.
Nonetheless, the authors do not necessarily agree with 
some of these recommendations. Our approach is to refer 
patients with failing Fontan physiology when they become 
symptomatic from heart failure and/or if they develop signs 
of end organ dysfunction. Waiting until a Fontan develops 
PLE or plastic bronchitis is, in our opinion, somewhat 
late to refer for consideration of cardiac transplantation. 
Furthermore, a PVR of 4 Wood units is considered 
a relative rather than an absolute contraindication to 
transplant, especially with the cadre of medications now 
available to treat pulmonary vascular disease. It also depends 
more on the reactivity of the pulmonary vascular bed with 
provocative testing than the absolute number. 
Waiting list and mechanical circulatory support 
as a bridge to cardiac transplantation
Attrition for wait-listed heart transplant patients is expected. 
Clinicians must be vigilant regarding the patient’s clinical 
status and the development of end organ dysfunction. 
When end organ dysfunction ensues, it may necessitate 
the use of mechanical circulatory support as a bridge 
to transplant. In the 2016 ISHLT guidelines of listing 
criteria for heart transplantation, mechanical circulatory 
support is recommended when patients develop potentially 
reversible or treatable comorbidities such as renal failure and 
pharmacologically reversible pulmonary hypertension (39). 
A broad selection of devices is available, including 
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, pulsatile devices, 
continuous flow devices, and the total artificial heart 
(Figure 2). High volume centers, including many pediatric 
centers, are able to offer these devices across the age 
spectrum. In 2011, Davies et al. evaluated risk factors for 
wait-list mortality utilizing the UNOS database over a 
15-year time period from 1995 to 2009 (42). The use of 
mechanical circulatory support was a risk factor for increased 
wait-list mortality in ACHD patients (regardless of device 
type) but not patients without congenital heart disease. 
In fact, in non-ACHD patients, the use of a ventricular 
assist device actually lowered wait-list mortality. This 
data was contradicted by a more contemporaneous report 
from the International Registry of Mechanically Assisted 
Circulation (INTERMACS). Vanderpluym and colleagues

used the INTERMACS registry to evaluate outcomes of 
circulatory support device use in patients ACHD patients. 
Over 10 years, there were 126 ACHD patients who received 
mechanical circulatory support out of 16,182 patients (43). 
Forty-five of the 126 patients had a systemic morphologic 
right ventricle. The remaining patients had other forms 
of UCHD or a morphologic systemic left ventricle. There 
were several important findings from this study. First, 70% 
of patients achieved a positive outcome over 6 months 
with 21% successfully bridged to transplant. More than 
50% of patients remained alive on the device. Second, 
the mortality in the ACHD patients was predominantly 
in patients undergoing biventricular support or receiving 
the total artificial heart. These patients were more often 
INTERMACS class 1 or 2, indicating that they were 
more high risk at the time of device implant with more 
end organ dysfunction. Third, ventricular morphology 
and the presence of UCHD were not predictors of poor 
outcome. But only 17 of the 126 patients had a UCHD 
diagnosis (44). The central message of the report was that 
with proper patient selection, a positive outcome is more 
often the case when using mechanical circulatory device or 
support in ACHD patients. With this in mind, others have 
suggested that it may be time to lower the threshold for use 
of mechanical circulatory support in this patient population, 
and that the poor results of the past may be due to the 
hesitation to place devices in these patients allowing them 
to become more ill (i.e., INTERMACS 1) (44). Finally, 
there may be an age advantage when considering mechanical 
circulatory support in ACHD patients. Rizwan et al. found 
that the lowest post-transplant survival of bridged congenital 
heart disease patients was between 15 and 29 years of age. 
Patients older than 30 years of age that were bridged to 
transplant, had improved post-transplant outcomes, and the 
post-transplant survival was comparable to those who were 
not bridged to transplant with a VAD (45). 
Surgical considerations
The transplant operation for ACHD patients is a challenging 
anatomic and physiologic undertaking. Patients presenting 
with previous Fontan reconstruction often require additional 
surgical procedures at the time of organ implantation. In 
this population, pulmonary artery, systemic venous, and/or 
great artery reconstruction are common additional surgical 
procedures (46). The need for reconstruction of the branch 
pulmonary arteries needs to be assessed prior to listing. This 
can be accomplished using cardiac catheterization or CT 
angiography. The author’s approach is to obtain a CT scan for 
re-operative cases. This aid not only in planning additional 
surgical reconstructions but is also useful for planning 
sternal re-entry. Knowing whether or not pulmonary artery 
reconstruction is necessary may impact the type of donor 
taken. For example, one may consider avoiding donors where 
the lungs are being harvested so that the donor pulmonary 
artery may be used for reconstruction of the recipient 
pulmonary arteries at the time of organ implantation. The 
donor pulmonary artery can be used as a free homograft (47) 
or as a patch. However, lung retrieval is not an absolute 
contraindication to utilizing a particular donor organ, because 
the pulmonary arteries can be reconstructed with synthetic 
patches, though this is not ideal. The need for pulmonary 
artery reconstruction may also impact the anastomotic 
sequence during organ implantation. The author’s preference 
is to reconstruct the branch pulmonary arteries prior to the 
ascending aorta reconstruction. This allows for uninhibited 
hilum-to-hilum access to the branch pulmonary arteries. 
Also notable is that second stage palliation with a hemi￾Fontan can be particularly problematic for pulmonary artery 
reconstruction and for controlling the large reconstructed 
neo-aorta in HLHS patients. In this scenario, the branch 
pulmonary arteries can be very thin walled and densely 
adherent to the ascending aorta relative to patients palliated 
with a bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt. For this reason, 
when faced with transplanting patients palliated with a hemi￾Fontan, the branch pulmonary arteries are not dissected out 
until establishment of cardiopulmonary bypass. This may 
help control potentially catastrophic intraoperative bleeding. 
Finally, because it is difficult to assess PVR pre-implant, we 
have found right ventricular dysfunction of the implanted 
graft to be a consistent finding. With that in mind, separating 
from cardiopulmonary bypass with right heart support is 
advantageous. We separate from cardiopulmonary bypass 
with milrinone and inhaled nitric oxide. A subset of ACHD 
patients, especially those with chronic cyanosis or Fontan 
physiology, can also be profoundly vasoplegic. In preparation 
for this, vasopressin and a host of vasoconstrictors should 
be available to help manage the low SVR state. If while on 
bypass this state becomes evident, vasopressin is started prior 
to separating from bypass.
Outcomes
Survival
Doumouras and colleagues conducted a meta-analysis of the 

148 Bryant and Morales. Adult congenital heart transplants

available literature on the outcomes of ACHD undergoing 
cardiac transplantation (48). Mortality was assessed at four 
different time points: 30-day (operative), 1-, 5-, and 10-year. 
The survival outcomes in ACHD were compared to a 
non-CHD cohort of adult patients undergoing heart 
transplantation. There was a statistically significant 
difference in survival post-transplant. The 30-day mortality 
was 17.4% in ACHD patients versus 7.4% in non-CHD 
adult patients undergoing cardiac transplantation. The only 
other statistically significant survival difference between 
ACHD and non-CHD adult heart transplant patients was at 
10-year. The mortality was 40.7% for ACHD patients versus 
49.0% for non-CHD adult patients (48) (Figure 3). Within 
the ACHD patients undergoing cardiac transplantation, 
where does the risk lie?
Risk factors for poor outcome post-transplant in 
ACHD patients
Several single institution and registry reports have 
indicated worse post-transplant survival in UCHD patients, 
particularly Fontan patients. The operative mortality 
in these reports varied between 14% to as high as 39% 
(3,5,49,50). In later eras, the mortality appeared to be 
more equivalent between adult patients undergoing cardiac 
transplantation after the Fontan procedure and non-CHD 
patients undergoing cardiac transplantation (51). The 
reported outcomes have been mixed in single institution 
series. The impact of UCHD was assessed in the meta￾analysis by Doumouras and colleagues. The operative 
mortality in UCHD patients palliated with either a Glenn 
shunt or total cavopulmonary connection (44%) was 
statistically higher than for non-CHD adult patients (14%) 
undergoing heart transplantation (48). UCHD patients 
can include those who have gone through staged palliation 
or those that remain unpalliated. UCHD patients who 
did not have a Glenn or Fontan in the Doumouras study 
had equivalent survival to adult patients undergoing heart 
transplant without congenital heart disease. This was a 
novel finding from other reports assessing the impact of 
UCHD on post-transplant outcome. It suggests that the 
early mortality after cardiac transplantation for ACHD 
patients is potentially attributable to palliated UCHD. This 
is likely related to the complexity of the reconstruction at 
the time of implant, the high incidence of right ventricular 
dysfunction of the graft due to persistent elevation of the 
PVR, and low SVR state from profound vasoplegia. 
The Doumouras meta-analysis was limited by the 
inability to separate out survival outcomes based on 
Glenn palliation or total cavopulmonary connection since 
the palliated UCHD patients were analyzed as a group. 
That analysis was also flawed by the lack of distinction 
between UCHD patients with impaired or preserved 
ventricular function. It has been shown that post-Fontan 
patients with preserved systolic ventricular function have 
worse post-transplant outcomes (4,31). This finding is 
related to high incidence of PLE potentially as a result 
of chronic ventricular volume overload from aorto￾pulmonary collaterals (52,53). Many of these patients also 
have diastolic dysfunction, and the transplanted heart must 
tackle the long-term ramifications of diastolic dysfunction 
(i.e., PVR, venous congestion). Another limitation of the 
Doumouras meta-analysis is that it did not assess post￾transplant survival based on immunosuppression strategy. 
Karamlou and colleagues conducted an extensive review of 
cardiac transplantation in ACHD patients using the UNOS 
database from 1990 to 2008 (14). The use of any induction 
therapy (P=0.008) and steroid maintenance therapy were 
associated with improved survival in all heart recipients. 
ACHD patients, in particular, gained a survival benefit with 
maintenance steroids. This finding was consistent with a 
series of ACHD transplantation reported from the Mayo 
clinic (1). 
Summary 
Experience with cardiac transplantation for ACHD 
patients with end-stage heart failure is growing. High-risk 
patient subsets have been defined. Strides have been made

selection, a judicious but more aggressive use of mechanical 
support, and earlier referral of patients with failing Fontan
