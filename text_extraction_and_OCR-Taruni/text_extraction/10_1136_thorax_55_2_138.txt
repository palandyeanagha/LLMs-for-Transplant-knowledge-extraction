Abstract
BACKGROUND Non-invasive assessment of inflammation is likely
to be useful in the management of cystic fibrosis (CF). Exhaled
carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations are increased in patients with
clinically stable CF. A study was undertaken to determine whether
this marker of oxidative damage is further increased during
exacerbations of the disease.
METHODS Exhaled CO concentrations were measured in 12 healthy
non-smoking control subjects (six men) of mean (SE) age 37 (2)
years with forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) 95 (1)%
predicted and in 44 patients with CF (20 men) of mean (SE) age 29
(1) years with FEV1 56 (3)% predicted using an on-line CO
analyser.
RESULTS Twenty nine patients were in a stable condition while 15
had clinically defined respiratory exacerbations (increased cough
and production of sputum, change in the quality of the sputum,
shortness of breath, sensation of chest congestion, and deterioration
of FEV1) and represented the unstable group. Exhaled CO
concentrations were 2.0 (0.15) ppm in the control group, were
increased in the stable CF group to 2.7 (0.13) ppm (differences
between means –0.67 (0.22), 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to
1.12, p<0.01) and further increased in the unstable group to 4.8
(0.3) ppm (differences between means –2.15 (0.32), 95% CI 1.50 to
2.79, p<0.001). A significant correlation was found between the
deterioration in FEV1 and exhaled CO concentrations.
CONCLUSIONS This study shows that the measurement of exhaled
CO is of potential value as an indicator of exacerbations in patients
with CF and could be used as a simple method to monitor the
course of the disease.
