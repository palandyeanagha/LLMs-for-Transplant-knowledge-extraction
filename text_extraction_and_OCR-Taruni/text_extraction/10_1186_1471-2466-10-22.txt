Abstract
Background: Liver dysfunction reflects the status of heart failure, with congestion and low perfusion of the liver 
serving as causative mechanisms. Previous studies demonstrated relationship between the results of liver function test 
and the prognosis in patients with heart failure. However, few studies have examined this relationship in patients with 
pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).
Methods: The subjects were 37 patients with PAH (8 men and 29 women; 18 with idiopathic PAH and 19 with 
connective tissue disease-associated PAH). A blood test was performed after a 3-month period free from 
hospitalization and without changes in functional class, treatment, heart sounds, body weight, or heart rate.
Results: In a mean follow-up period of 635 ± 510 days, 12 patients died due to heart failure, 2 died due to pulmonary 
hemorrhage, and 23 patients survived. Cox proportional hazard analyses identified functional class (p < 0.001), plasma 
concentration of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) (p = 0.001), and hyperbilirubinemia (serum total bilirubin > 1.2 mg/dL; 
p < 0.001; hazard ratio = 13.31) as predictors of mortality. Patients with hyperbilirubinemia had a worse functional class 
(P = 0.003), a higher right atrial pressure (p < 0.001), a higher plasma concentration of BNP (p = 0.004), and a larger 
Doppler right ventricular index of the right ventricle (p = 0.041).
Conclusion: Elevated serum bilirubin is a risk factor for death in patients with PAH.
Background
Patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)
have an increased risk of mortality, and half of the
patients in World Health Organization (WHO) func￾tional class IV die within 3 years, even after treatment
with epoprostenol [1]. Right heart failure is a major cause
of death in patients with PAH [1]. The prognosis of PAH
is predicted by markers of heart failure including WHO
functional class [1], the plasma concentration of brain
natriuretic peptide (BNP) [2], history of right heart fail￾ure, 6-minute-walk distance, mean blood pressure of the
right atrium [1], and Doppler right ventricular index (Tei
index of the right ventricle)[3]. Despite use of these mark￾ers, however, prediction of survival for each patient
remains as a challenge in cardiology.
Liver dysfunction reflects the status of heart failure,
with congestion and low perfusion of the liver serving as
causative mechanisms [4-7]. The prognosis of heart fail￾ure has been associated with serum levels of aspartate
aminotransferase and total bilirubin [4], but few studies
have examined data from liver function tests as potential
prognostic markers for patients with PAH. Therefore, we
sought to determine whether the results of liver function
tests could be used to predict prognosis in such patients.
Methods
Enrollment of patients
From August 2005 to March 2009, 62 consecutive
patients with PAH of functional class II to IV were
referred to our hospital to receive further care. Diagnosis
of PAH was based on the results of right heart catheter￾ization at rest [8]; mean pulmonary artery pressure > 25
mm Hg, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ≤ 15 mm
Hg, and pulmonary vascular resistance > 3 Wood units.
Pulmonary hypertension with left heart valve disease, left
ventricular ejection fraction < 50% (Venice Group 2),

disease, lung parenchymal disease, sleep disordered

bolism in a lung perfusion scan (Venice Group 4) were
not considered as PAH. Only patients with idiopathic
PAH (Venice Group 1.1) or PAH associated with connec￾tive tissue disorder (CTD) (Venice Group 1.3.1) [9] were
enrolled in the study.
One patient with Venice Group 1.2 (familial) PAH, 21
patients with congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunt
(Venice Group 1.3.2), 3 with parenchymal liver disease
(Venice Group 1.3.3), and 1 with adult immune deficiency
syndrome (Venice Group 1.3.4) were excluded from the
study. We did not encounter patients with drug-induced
PAH (Venice Group 1.3.5), thyroid disease, glycogen stor￾age disease, Gaucher's disease, hereditary hemorrhagic
telangiectasia, hemoglobinopathies, myeloproliferative
disorders, or splenectomy (Venice Group 1.3.6). No
patients had PAH in Venice Group 1.4 (pulmonary veno￾occlusive disease or pulmonary capillary hemangiomato￾sis) proven by pathological examination or specific medi￾cal history including an abnormal response to pulmonary
vasodilators. We also did not encounter any patient with
PAH in Venice Group 1.5 (persistent pulmonary hyper￾tension of the newborn).
Thirty-seven patients (8 men and 29 women) partici￾pated in the study after giving informed consent. These
patients received a baseline examination after a 3-month
period free from hospitalization for any cause and with￾out changes in WHO functional class, treatment, heart
sounds, body weight (> 2.0 kg), or heart rate (> 20 beat/
min). Our protocol permitted body-weight-targeted
adjustment of dose of diuretics. The baseline was defined
as the day on which a blood examination was performed.
The institutional ethics committee approved the study
protocol.
Baseline examinations
Blood samples for liver function tests were drawn from a
peripheral vein after an overnight fast. For measurement
of the plasma concentration of BNP, samples were imme￾diately placed on ice and centrifuged at 4°C. BNP was
measured using an immunoradiometric assay by an
external laboratory (SRL Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Aspartate
aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehy￾drogenase, and total bilirubin were measured in the core
laboratory at our hospital. The normal ranges are 13-38,
6-27, 119-229, and 0.3-1.2 mg/dL, respectively. Hyperbili￾rubinemia was defined as serum total bilirubin > 1.2 mg/
dL.
A trained sonographer recorded all echocardiograms
using a commercially available system (SSA-770A,
Toshiba Medical Co., Tokyo, Japan). Cardiac index was
calculated using a Doppler echo technique [10] and right
ventricular function was determined from the Doppler
right ventricular index; the definition and measurement
procedure have been described elsewhere [11]. The pres￾sure gradient between the right ventricle and right atrium
was calculated with the simplified Bernoulli equation
[11]. The sweep speed was 150 mm/s. All measurements
were made at the end of expiration.
Right heart catheterization
Right heart catheterization was performed in 26 patients
within 14 days before or after the day of the blood test,
without any change of treatment in the intervening
period. The mean right atrial pressure and mean pulmo￾nary arterial pressure obtained in this procedure were
used for survival analysis. All the patients in the study
underwent catheterization, but we did not use hemody￾namic data for survival analysis in 11 patients due to a
change of treatment between catheterization and the
blood test.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed with the Statistical
Package for Social Science version 15.0 for Windows
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Survival times were defined as
the time from baseline until July 31, 2009. All data but the
concentrations of BNP expressed as means ± standard
deviations. The concentrations of BNP were transformed
to their natural logarithms to normalize the distribution
for testing differences. The BNP data are expressed as the
median with 25th and 75th percentiles. Comparisons of
parameters between two groups were made by unpaired
Student t-test or Mann-Whitney U test, as appropriate,
and comparison among three groups was made by one￾way analysis of variance with a Scheffe post hoc test. Cat￾egorical variables were compared with a Fisher exact test
in the case of a 2 × 2 contingency table and a chi-square
test for a 3 × 2 contingency table. The prognostic values
of the variables were tested in univariate Cox propor￾tional-hazards regression analyses. The results are
expressed as hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals.
Survival curves were derived using the Kaplan-Meier
method. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant in all analyses.
Results
Characteristics of the patients
As shown in Table 1, 18 patients had idiopathic PAH and
19 had CTD-associated PAH. All patients in WHO func￾tional class III or IV and 11 patients in class II received
oxygen therapy. The follow-up period was 635 ± 510 days
and no patients dropped out of follow-up until comple￾tion of the analysis on July 31, 2009. During the study
period, 12 patients died of heart failure, 2 died due to pul￾monary hemorrhage, and 23 survived until the end of the
study. No patients received lung or heart-lung transplan￾tation, despite some being listed for lung transplantation.
Death occurred in 9 patients in WHO functional class IV

III and IV, and p < 0.001 between class II and IV, respec￾tively.
Mortality predictors
Univariate Cox proportional hazard analyses were per￾formed using data from liver function tests and conven￾tional mortality predictors: mean right atrial pressure,
mean pulmonary arterial pressure, cardiac index, WHO
functional class, and plasma concentration of BNP. These
analyses demonstrated that WHO functional class (p <
0.001), BNP (p = 0.001), the serum concentration of bili￾rubin (p = 0.001), and hyperbilirubinemia (p < 0.001) pre￾dicted the risk of death. Patients with hyperbilirubinemia
had markedly worse survival than those with normobili￾rubinemia (Figure 1), and had a worse WHO functional
class (P = 0.003), higher mRAP (p < 0.001), higher BNP (p
= 0.004), and a larger Doppler RV index (p = 0.041). The
mean pulmonary arterial pressure did not differ signifi￾cantly between patients with hyperbilirubinemia and
those with normobilirubinemia (Table 1).
Given the interdependence between WHO functional
class and plasma BNP concentration, two models of
bivariate analysis were analyzed: a model using WHO
functional class and hyperbilirubinemia (both categorical
data, Model 1) and a model using BNP and bilirubin con￾centration (both continuous data, Model 2). In these
models, hyperbilirubinemia and bilirubin concentration
were found to be predictors of a risk of death indepen￾dently of WHO functional class and BNP, respectively
(Table 2).
Discussion
The current study suggests that hyperbilirubinemia is
associated with advanced right heart failure and reduced
survival in patients with PAH, compared with patients
with a normal serum bilirubin concentration. Hyperbili￾rubinemia was associated with a worse WHO functional
class, higher right atrial pressure, higher BNP, and a
larger Doppler right ventricular index. Thus, our results
suggest that hyperbilirubinemia is a powerful, yet simple
and readily available, marker of advanced right heart fail￾ure and poor prognosis in patients with PAH.
Our results also show that bilirubin is more sensitive to
hemodynamic abnormality than transaminases. This is
consistent with a recent investigation showing the superi￾ority of bilirubin over transaminases in sensitivity to
hemodynamic abnormality in patients with left heart fail￾ure [12]. This study also showed that the serum bilirubin
level is a strong, independent predictor of an adverse
prognosis in patients with left heart failure, even after
adjustment for a variety of demographic, clinical, and
biochemical variables [12]. Serum bilirubin has also been
shown to correlate with hemodynamic parameters such
as right atrial pressure [6,13] and severity of tricuspid
regurgitation [6,13], and biliary obstruction may poten￾tially be caused by high hepatic venous pressure [14,15].
Conversely, correlations of transaminases with these
parameters have not been found [5,14].
There are several limitations to our study. The sample
size was small and further studies in a larger number of
patients are required to confirm the conclusions. Doppler
echocardiography was used to measure cardiac index
because thermodilution or Fick's method was unavailable
due to severe tricuspid regurgitation or use of oxygen
therapy, respectively. We did not use the 6-minute-walk
test in the statistical analyses because many of our
patients could not tolerate this stress, and performance of
a precise walk stress test is difficult in patients receiving
continuous oxygenation therapy. The number of patients
with CTD-associated PAH and the high mortality rate
might reflect a referral bias because our institute is an
academic center for cases of pulmonary hypertension
that have treatment difficulties. Finally, normal serum
concentration of bilirubin does not guarantee that the
risk of death is always low.
Conclusions
In conclusion, the study demonstrated that hyperbiliru￾binemia is associated with advanced right heart failure
and markedly reduced survival in patients with PAH.
Therefore, serum bilirubin should be monitored in man￾agement of patients with PAH.
