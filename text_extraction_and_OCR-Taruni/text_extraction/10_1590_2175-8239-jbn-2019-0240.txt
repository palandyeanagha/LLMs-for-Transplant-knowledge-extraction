Cystatin C: not just a marker of kidney function
Cistatina C: não é apenas um marcador da função renal
DOI: 10.1590/2175-8239-JBN-2019-0240
Cystatin C, first described in 1961 
and formally named in 1984, is a non￾glycosylated, basic protein encoded by 
the CST3 gene that is found in virtually 
all nucleated cells. It is a potent inhibitor 
of lysosomal proteinases and extracellular 
inhibitors of cysteine proteases that play 
a pleiotropic role in human vascular 
pathophysiology, in particular regulating 
cathepsins, which are overexpressed in 
atherosclerotic and aneurysmal lesions1
.
The role of serum cystatin C as a 
measure of kidney function (filtration) 
is now well established. Cystatin C is 
generated at a mostly constant rate, is 
freely filtered, reabsorbed and catabolized 
in the proximal tubule of the nephron 2
. It 
is not affected by body habitus and muscle 
mass and as such, it is thought to be a 
more accurate measure of kidney function 
compared to serum creatinine 3
. Standard 
reference materials are now available for 
cystatin C such that laboratory assays are 
standardized with glomerular filtration 
rate estimating equations (eGFR) 
developed and validated for routine 
clinical use3
. Limitations to its routine 
use in clinical practice has been primarily 
cost considerations where, for example, 
it costs up to ten times that of a serum 
creatinine assay 4
 and it can be affected by 
thyroid disease, adiposity, and underlying 
inflammation1, 5.
Beyond its use in the estimation of 
kidney function, cystatin C-based eGFR 
has been shown to be a superior predictor 
of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and 
mortality when compared to serum 
creatinine-based eGFR6
. In fact, when 
combined with albuminuria, cystatin C 
eGFR added predictive discrimination to 
routinely used current CVD risk scores 
whereas serum creatinine-based eGFR 
did not add additional discrimination 
4
. This suggests that cystatin C-based 
eGFR should be used not only to assess 
kidney function, but also should be part 
of an individual’s cardiovascular risk 
assessment. 
Other potential roles for cystatin 
C include being an earlier marker for 
acute kidney injury, a superior marker of 
kidney transplant function, CVD risk and 
transplant failure, and a more accurate 
measure of function in specific sub￾populations such as liver cirrhosis and 
oncology6
. In this issue of the Brazilian 
Journal of Nephrology, Moreira et al. 
assess another specific sub-population 
where cystatin C may have additional 
utility over serum creatinine and other 
markers, namely subjects with end stage 
kidney disease7
.
Moreira et al. assessed serum and 
peritoneal dialysis effluent cystatin C in 
52 patients treated with peritoneal dialysis 
(PD) in a single dialysis center. In addition 
to the assessment of residual renal function 
(RRF) they explored the correlation of 
cystatin C and cardiovascular events as 
well as an assessment of body composition 
using bioimpedance. Like the general 
population, higher levels of cystatin C 
was associated with a two-fold increase 
in the likelihood of cardiovascular disease 
(odds ratio (OR) 2.65), although the 95% 
confidence interval was wide, reflecting 
significant uncertainty in the result (0.84 
to 8.37). This is not surprising given the 
limitations of the small sample size and the

cross-sectional nature of the study design and analysis. 
The assessment of RRF in patients treated with PD 
is critical given its importance in prognosis and total 
overall dialysis clearance. The current study reaffirms 
our understanding that cystatin C may be a good 
marker of assessing RRF. Patients who have been on 
PD longer have a higher cystatin C level correlating 
to the gradual loss of RRF seen after dialysis 
commencement. Weekly total creatinine clearance 
was significantly negatively correlated with cystatin C 
levels as would be expected. It is important to note that 
PD also removes cystatin C and hence its levels will be 
determined by both RRF and dialysis clearance. Also 
as expected, cystatin C levels positively correlated 
with relative lean tissue mass. 
While the study by Moreira et al. raises more 
questions than it answers due to the size and study 
design, given the role of cystatin C as an established 
tool for the assessment of kidney function in the 
general and CKD population as well as an additive 
marker of cardiovascular risk assessment, further 
large prospective studies in the PD population are 
warranted in order to delineate whether cystatin C will 
have a role in the management of the PD population.
