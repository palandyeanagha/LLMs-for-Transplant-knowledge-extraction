In small infants or neonates, open heart surgery without transfusion can have many risks regarding inadequate 
oxygen delivery and coagulopathy. However, if parents refuse blood transfusion, cardiac surgery without transfusion 
should be considered. We report a case of bloodless cardiac surgery in a 2.89 kg neonate with Jehovah's Witness 
parents. Blood conserving strategies were used. Preoperatively, erythropoietin and iron were supplemented to 
increase the hemoglobin level. Intraoperatively, techniques for minimizing blood loss were used, such as reducing 
priming volume for cardiopulmonary bypass, a blood salvage system, and modified ultrafiltration. Postoperatively, 
pharmacologic agents were administered and blood sampling was minimized. (Korean J Anesthesiol 2010; 59:

 Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and cardiac surgery can 
cause bleeding and coagulopathy. In neonates, transfusion 
may be inevitable for open heart surgery because the CPB 
circuit surface and the priming volume are relatively large in 
relation to the patient size and blood volume. In addition, even 
a small blood loss can decrease the ability to deliver oxygen 
and cause coagulation abnormalities. Despite these facts, some 
Jehovah's Witnesses parents refuse transfusion to their children 
for religious reasons and this is a huge challenge for health 
care providers. We report a case of open heart surgery without 
transfusion in a 2.89 kg neonate whose parents are Jehovah's 
Witness. 
Case Report
 The patient was born by vaginal delivery at 39 weeks 
gestational age and weighed 2,870 g. The Apgar score was 6 at 
one minute and 9 at five minutes. Oxygen saturation (SpO2) on 
100% oxygen was 85% in the lower extremities, and 95% in the 
upper extremities. Prenatal examination showed: coarctation of 
the aorta, severe hydronephrosis (grade 5) with ureter dilatation 
in the right kidney, a single umbilical artery, periventricular 
echogenecity on brain ultrasound (grade 1), and cleft palate. 
Echocardiogram showed coarctation of the aorta with an 
isthmus of 2.7 mm, a stenotic length of 6 mm, patent ductus

arteriosus (PDA) of 3.3 mm with a bidirectional shunt (mainly 
left to right shunt), and an atrial septal defect (ASD). Heart CT 
showed the site of coarctation to be the upper thoracic aorta at 
the point of the insertion of the PDA.
 Despite continuous intravenous infusion of prostaglandin 
E1 (PGE1) at 0.002 μg/kg/min, the PDA size was diminished 
and left ventricular dysfunction developed. Mechanical 
ventilation was started and PGE1, dobutamine, furosemide, 
spironolacton, and captopril were administered. After deciding 
for early surgical correction, treatment to increase hemoglobin 
was initiated because the parents refused transfusion to their 
child. Recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) 300 U/
kg/day was administered subcutaneously with ferric hydroxide￾polymaltose complex solution 0.5 ml (10 mg/day) per os for 10 
days.
 On the 16th day, blood pressures were 102/47 mmHg in the 
right arm, 100/57 mmHg in the left arm, 59/39 mmHg in the 
right leg, and 60/27 mmHg in the left leg. SpO2 on 20% oxygen 
was 92-100% in the upper extremities and 82-100% in the 
lower extremities. The heart rate was 136-154 beats/min and 
the respiratory rate was 40-43 breaths/min. The preoperative 
coagulation data was prothrombin time 75% (INR 1.21) and 
partial thromboplastin time 49.1 seconds. On the 17th day, the 
patient (height 52 cm, weight 2,890 g) received PDA division, 
coarctation repair and ASD closure. After induction with 
thiopental 15 mg, midazolam 0.3 mg, atropine 0.06 mg, and 
vecuronium 0.6 mg, anesthesia was maintained with a mixture 
of sufentanil 250 μg, midazolam 5 mg, and vecuronium 10 mg in 
100 ml normal saline at 6 ml/hr. Sevoflurane was administered 
at the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist. Arterial blood 
pressure was continuously measured in the left brachial artery 
and the left dorsalis pedis artery. Central venous pressure was 
monitored at the left subclavian vein. Cerebral oximeter probes 
were applied to monitor cerebral oxygen saturation. 
 After the patient was systemically heparinized by the 
intravenous injection of heparin 9 mg, CPB was started. At that 
time, the activated coagulation time (ACT) was 472 seconds. 
The neonate CPB system (Heart-Lung machine HL 30TM, 
Maquet, Germany) was used with a high-performance, low 
prime volume oxygenator (RX-05TM, Terumo, Japan). Arterial 
and venous lines had a 3/16 inch inner diameter. With this set￾up, the bypass circuit was minimized in volume and primed 
with 50 ml plasma solution A, 50 ml 20% albumin, and 20 ml 
hydroxyethyl starch. The total prime volume for the CPB was 
120 ml. Cannulations were done in the right innominate artery, 
the right atrium, and the inferior vena cava, with 8 French, 
14 French, and 14 French cannulae, respectively. During 
cannulation, 25 ml hydroxyethyl starch and phenylephrine were 
administered. The pump flow was set at a rate of 1.84-2.47 ml/
min/m2
.
 Regional cerebral perfusion using the right innominate artery 
was performed during the repair of the coarctation of the aorta. 
The left common carotid artery and left subclavian artery were 
snared down. The pump flow rate of regional cerebral perfusion 
was 150 ml/min. For 20 minutes of regional cerebral perfusion, 
regional cerebral oxygen saturation ranged from 48% to 51% 
and 53% to 58% on the right and left sides, respectively (Fig. 1).

 Intraoperative arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) was measured 
in regular intervals (Table 1). The intraoperative changes in 
lactate and pH were minimal. At the cardiopulmonary pump, 
calcium chloride 90 mg was injected to correct the electrolyte 
imbalance. The total CPB time was 126 minutes. After weaning 
off the cardiopulmonary pump, modified ultrafltration was 
performed. Decannulation was then performed and the 
heparin activity was antagonized with protamine 9 mg (ACT 
415 seconds). 
 At the start of rewarming, sodium nitroprusside 0.5 μg/kg/min 
was infused and dobutamine 5 μg/kg/min was administered 
before weaning from the CPB. After weaning from the CPB, 
sodium nitroprusside was discontinued and the infusion rate of 
dobutamine was increased to 7 μg/kg/min, and the continuous 
infusion of epinephrine was started at 0.05 μg/kg/min 
because of hemodynamic instability. Intermittently, a bolus of 
epinephrine and calcium chloride was injected for the control of 
blood pressure. Intraoperative hemodynamic changes and the 
nasopharyngeal temperature are shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. After 
weaning from the CPB, the cerebral oximeter values decreased 
and maintained relatively low levels despite a trial of increased 
cardiac output and maintenance of normocarbia.
 At the end of surgery, autologous blood recovery systems 
(Cell SaverTM, Medtronic, USA) were prepared to collect 
residual blood from the pump system. When 150 ml blood was 
collected from the pump, the hematocrit value of collected 
blood was not checkable due to below 15%. The collected blood 
from the pump was transfused for volume expansion. The 
patient was transferred to a neonatal intensive care unit with 
continuous intravenous infusion of dobutamine 5 μg/kg/min 
and epinephrine 0.05 μg/kg/min. The total anesthetic time was 
360 minutes and the total operative time was 240 minutes (CPB 
time 126 min). The total infused fluid was 15 ml plasma solution 
A and 10 ml Hartmann’s solution. The estimated blood loss was 
about 30 ml and the urine output was 30 ml.
 Postoperatively, tranexamic acid 30 mg, divided into six 
doses, and vitamin K1 0.6 mg were supplemented on the day 
of surgery. Blood sampling was minimized. On postoperative 
echocardiogram, both left ventricular dysfunction and the site 
of coarctation of the aorta were improved. Ferric hydroxide￾polymaltose complex and rHuEPO were intravenously admini￾stered for 9 days to correct postoperative anemia. Since leuko￾cytosis and thrombocytosis occurred as a complication after 
the use of rHuEPO, only 50 mg of ferric hydroxide-polymaltose 
complex was injected daily. The changes in hematologic data 
during the course of hospitalization are shown in Table 2. There 
was no further coagulation test to minimize blood sampling

after surgery. On postoperative day 5, the patient was extubated. 
There were no signs of bleeding and the vital signs were stable. 
On postoperative day 10, the patient was transferred to a 
general ward without any complications. On postoperative day 
7, brain sonography showed no specific findings. However, on 
postoperative day 22, brain MRI showed diffusion restriction 
in the posterior side of the corpus callosal body and splenium, 
suggestive of acute to subacute infarction and diffuse brain 
atrophy. On neurological examination, there was no spasticity 
and no other specific findings except for hyperreflexia of both 
knees (3+).
Discussion
 In small infants or neonates, especially those under 5 kg, 
open heart surgery without transfusion is considered a high 
risk procedure because of the high degree of hemodilution 
associated with impaired oxygen delivery and coagulopathy 
[1]. However, when the blood cannot be transfused, risk can 
be reduced by bloodless cardiac surgery techniques such as 
preoperative hematopoiesis enhancement, use of a downsized 
CPB, intraoperative minimal blood loss, and postoperative 
bleeding control [2]. 
 Preoperatively, the hemoglobin level can be increased with 
erythropoietin and oral iron supplementation. Erythropoietin 
therapy induces red blood cell volume expansion by increasing 
reticulocytes and its effectiveness can be evaluated by 
hemoglobin level. The optimal dose of erythropoietin is still 
unclear. However, for expanding red blood cell volume in a 
short period, a maximum dose of 600 IU/kg every second day 
is recommended. The supplementation of iron at at least 100 
mg/day is important in erythropoietin therapy to stimulate 
bone marrow, especially in iron deficiency [3,4]. Furthermore, 
erythropoietin enhances cellular protection in hypoxic injuries 
and may limit myocardial injury and ventricular dysfunction 
after ischemic events [5,6].
 Minimal intraoperative blood loss is important for 
transfusion-free cardiac surgery. Perioperative blood salvage 
can be performed by autologous blood recovery systems 
depending on the patient’s wishes. A continuous column 
of blood must be maintained between the salvage device 
and the patient, which can salvage more than 60% of blood 
loss [7]. The modified ultrafiltration technique also removes 
major mediators of the inflammation response, decreases 
postoperative bleeding, and improves myocardial contractility 
and pulmonary compliance [1]. 
 Open heart surgery using CPB impairs the function of the 
hemostatic system due to hemodilution, administration of 
heparin during CPB, loss of platelets and impairment of platelet 
function, and inadequate functioning of the fibrinolytic system. 
Since most Jehovah’s Witness patients will not allow the use of 
fresh frozen plasma, platelet concentrate, or cryoprecipitate, 
pharmacologic aids may be useful in individual cases. For 
example, aprotinin, tranexamic acid, epsilon aminocaproic acid, 
desmopressin (deamino D-arginine vasopressin [DDAVP]), or 
recombinant factor VIIa can be supplemented. Aprotinin, 
derived from bovine lung, directly inhibits serine proteases, 
including plasmin, kallikrein and thrombin. It can improve 
platelet function and inhibit accelerated fibrinolysis during 
CPB. Lysine analogues, such as aminocaproic acid and 
tranexamic acid, are potent antifibrinolytic agents that inter￾fere with the binding of plasminogen to fibrin. DDAVP, a 
vasopressin analogue, increases the plasma concentration of 
von Willebrand factor (and associated coagulation factor VIII) 
and thus improves primary hemostasis. These interventions 
improve clinical outcomes such as perioperative mortality and 
the need for rethoracotomy [8-11].
 Body weight, preoperative hematocrit, priming volume of 
the CPB circuit, CPB time, and lowest hematocrit during CPB 
can predict requirements for blood transfusion during open 
heart surgery in small infants and neonates [12]. In our case, the 
patient was supplemented with erythropoietin and took oral 
iron prior to surgery. The effect of erythropoietin and oral iron 
supplementation seemed effective, preventing a further drop 
of the hematocrit level preoperatively. During surgery, the CPB 
circuit was modified to reduce total priming volume and the 
tubing length and diameter were minimized. Also, the modified 
ultrafiltration technique was applied. At the end of surgery, 
autologous blood recovery systems were prepared for collecting 
residual blood from the pump system.
 During the CPB, hemodilution was performed to a hematocrit 
of 19%. In addition, regional cerebral oxygen saturation 
maintained a low value after CPB. Cerebral autoregulation may 
be impaired after CPB. Alexi-Meskishvili et al. reported that 
hemodilution in cyanotic patients must be limited to less than 
40% [1]. In the light of these facts, hypoxic injury due to a low 
hematorcrit may have caused the lesion which was seen on 
brain BRI on postoperative day 22. However, it is not yet clear 
whether the brain lesion is congenital or acquired. Further 
evaluation and follow-up will be required.
 In our case, arterial blood pressure was monitored at the left 
brachial artery because cannulation of the arteries in the right 
arm failed. Therefore, it was not possible to monitor cerebral 
perfusion pressure during regional cerebral perfusion. A 
cerebral oximeter may have been helpful in this situation.
 In previous cardiac surgery studies, the mortality and compli￾cation rates in Jehovah’s Witness groups were similar to those 
of control groups, with Jehovah’s Witness group having fewer 
hours of intubation, less blood loss over 24 hours, shorter 
intensive care unit length of stay and shorter total hospital

stay [13-15]. In Korea, many surgeries proceed without 
blood transfusion for religious or medical reasons, but such 
procedures are rare in infants less than 3 kg. Our patient is the 
smallest neonate in Korea to undergo transfusion-free open 
heart surgery.
 In conclusion, we were able to perform transfusion-free open 
heart surgery in a neonate weighing less than 3 kg by increasing 
preoperative hemoglobin levels, reducing priming volume 
for CPB, using the refined perfusion technique, minimizing 
perioperative blood loss with a blood salvage system, 
performing gentle surgery, and using pharmacologic agents.
