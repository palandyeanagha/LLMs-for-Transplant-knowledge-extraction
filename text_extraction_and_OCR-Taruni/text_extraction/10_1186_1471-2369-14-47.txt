Abstract
Background: Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a frequent cause of end-stage renal disease. Renal
transplantation in patients with FSGS is often complicated by disease recurrence, which is associated with poor
outcome. There are no tests that reliably predict recurrence of FSGS after transplantation. The aim of this study was
to evaluate if clinical criteria can identify patients at high risk for recurrent disease.
Methods: We retrospectively studied 94 patients who received a first renal transplant at a median age of 37 years
(range 5–69 years). Patients were assigned to one of three groups: familial or genetic FSGS (group I; n=18),
secondary FSGS (group II; n=10) and idiopathic FSGS (group III; n=66). Pretransplant clinical characteristics were
analyzed to determine predictors of a recurrence after transplantation.
Results: FSGS only recurred in patients with idiopathic FSGS (group III; 42%). Patients with a recurrence had a
significantly lower serum albumin, higher 24-hour proteinuria and higher estimated glomerular filtration rate at
diagnosis. Serum albumin at diagnosis was the only independent predictor of a recurrence in patients with
idiopathic FSGS. Patients with recurrent FSGS had more acute rejection episodes (54% vs. 27%, P =0.02) and lower
five year graft survival compared to patients without a recurrence (50 vs. 82%, P <0.01).
Conclusions: Clinical criteria allow identification of patients at high risk of recurrent FSGS after renal transplantation.
This information can be used in the counseling and management of patients with FSGS.

Background
Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a histo￾logical diagnosis and not a single disease entity. FSGS
can occur at any age and presenting features include a
variable degree of proteinuria, microscopic hematuria,
hypertension and decreased glomerular filtration rate.
While numerous causes for FSGS have been identified,
still most patients are diagnosed with idiopathic FSGS
[1,2]. Progression to end-stage renal disease is common,
especially in patients with decreased glomerular filtra￾tion rate or nephrotic range proteinuria at presentation
[1]. In case of end-stage renal disease, renal transplant￾ation is usually the treatment of choice. After renal
transplantation, FSGS is reported to recur in 15-52% of
first grafts [3-10]. Significant proteinuria often pro￾gressing to nephrotic range proteinuria in the first days
after transplantation heralds a recurrence in virtually all
patients [11]. Graft biopsy may either disclose normal
glomeruli or typical FSGS lesions on light microscopy,
and effacement of the epithelial foot processes on elec￾tron microscopy [12,13]. Without treatment, recurrent
FSGS leads to early graft failure in more than 50% of
patients [14,15]. There is strong evidence that a circulat￾ing permeability factor is responsible for glomerular in￾jury in many patients with recurrent FSGS after
transplantation [16,17]. The suggestion of a circulating

permeability factor has led to the use of plasma ex￾change for the treatment of recurrent FSGS. When
initiated early after onset of proteinuria, plasma ex￾change can induce a remission of proteinuria and
portends a better prognosis [18,19]. Therefore, accurate
identification of patients at risk for recurrent FSGS is an
important issue.
We report a retrospective analysis of all patients with
FSGS, who received a first renal transplant in our center.
The purpose of the study was to define clinical criteria
which would allow to identify patients at high risk for
recurrent disease during pretransplant counseling.
Methods
We identified all patients with FSGS who received a first
renal transplant in our center in the period 1968–2009.
Patients were included if the diagnosis of FSGS was
confirmed on a native renal biopsy or if they had other￾wise unexplained proteinuria and a first degree relative
with biopsy proven FSGS. Patients with FSGS lesions
secondary to other glomerular diseases including IgA
nephropathy, membranous nephropathy and Alport dis￾ease were excluded.
For the purpose of the study, the medical records and
pathology reports were reviewed. The Hospital Research
Ethics Committee deemed formal committee review of
the study unnecessary. Data collection was performed
according to the Dutch Code of Conduct for Health
Research.
Patients were assigned to one of three groups: Group I:
patients with a first degree relative with FSGS and/or
identified gene mutations that cause FSGS. Group II:
patients with secondary FSGS based on previously
published criteria (with exclusion of cases assigned to
group I) [1]. Group III: patients without evidence of gen￾etic or secondary FSGS. This group is referred to as idio￾pathic FSGS. Assignment to a group was done without
knowledge of transplantation outcome.
Definitions
Date of onset of FSGS in native kidneys was defined as
date of first presentation. Date of diagnosis was recorded
as biopsy date. Glomerular filtration rate was estimated
with the abbreviated MDRD study equation in adults
and the Schwartz formula in children (age < 16 years)
[20,21]. Definite recurrence of FSGS was defined as the
occurrence of progressive proteinuria after transplant￾ation, with 1) evidence of FSGS on light microscopy
or 2) normal appearing glomeruli on light microscopy,
but foot process effacement on electron microscopy. A
probable recurrence was defined as proteinuria with nor￾mal glomeruli on light microscopy and no electron mi￾croscopy performed. Acute antibody mediated rejection
has been described as a possible cause of early heavy
posttransplant proteinuria [22]. Any histologic signs of
antibody mediated rejection were therefore recorded.
Delayed graft function was defined as need for dialysis
within the first week after transplantation.
Statistical analysis
Values were expressed as median with range or mean ±
SD. Statistical differences between groups were assessed
with Chi-square or Fisher exact test, unpaired Student’s
t test or Mann Whitney U test, where appropriate. We
used a binary probit model to identify independent
predictors of recurrent FSGS [23]. To improve the valid￾ity of multivariate data analyses, 100 data sets were
created with imputed values for albumin, 24-hour pro￾teinuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
using Stata’s ice procedure [24]. Ordinary least squares
regression analysis was used to impute missing values.
This model included age, gender, eGFR, proteinuria,
serum albumin, and recurrence after transplantation
[25]. The association between predictor and imputed
variables were assumed to be linear, no interactions were
included as effect modification was deemed unlikely to
be present in the final analysis. Kaplan–Meier curves
and log-rank tests were used for description and com￾parison of graft survival. A two-sided P-value <0.05 was
considered as the level of statistical significance for all
tests. The analyses were performed with the use of SPSS
16.0 for Windows (SPSS inc, Chicago, IL, USA) and
Stata 10 for Windows (Stata Corporation, Texas, USA).
Results
Baseline characteristics
We identified 94 patients with FSGS who received a first
renal transplant. In 92 patients, the diagnosis was proven
by renal biopsy. In addition, in two patients the diagnosis
FSGS was based on the presence of proteinuria and the
family history of a first degree relative with biopsy proven
FSGS. Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1.
Eighty-five patients were native Dutch. The remaining
patients were Turkish (n=3), Moroccan (n=1), Dutch
Antillian (n=1), Sri Lankan (n=1), Indonesian (n=1), Iran￾ian (n=1) and Somalian (n=1). Thirty-two patients were
younger than 16 years at onset of FSGS. Eighteen patients
were diagnosed with familial/genetic FSGS (group I).
Mutations were identified in four of them. One patient
had a three-allelic mutation (compound heterozygous
mutations in the NPHS2-gene and one mutation in the
NPHS1-gene), two related patients had homozygous
mutations in the NPHS2-gene and one patient had a mu￾tation in the WT1-gene. A secondary cause was identified
in 10 patients (group II): renal agenesis (n=3), traumatic
kidney injury (n=1), hypoplasia of one kidney (n=1), reflux
nephropathy (n=2), chronic pyelonephritis (n=1), a history
of intravenous heroin abuse (n=1), and Hajdu-Cheney

syndrome (n=1) [26]. Idiopathic FSGS was diagnosed in
66 patients (group III).
A diagnosis of FSGS was made at a median of 6.0 years
(0.3-36.9 years) before renal transplantation. Patients were
on dialysis for a median of 1.4 years (0–9.3 years) before
transplantation. Bilateral nephrectomy was performed be￾fore transplantation in six patients, all were children. Four
patients underwent preemptive renal transplantation.
Recurrence after renal transplantation
FSGS recurred in 28 patients (30%; Table 1). Twenty-four
patients had a definite recurrence of FSGS and four
patients had a probable recurrence. Typical FSGS lesions
were seen in light microscopy in biopsies of 11 patients. In
none of the patients there was evidence of acute trans￾plant glomerulopathy. Peritubular capillary C4d staining
was performed in biopsies of six patients with a recur￾rence, and all were negative. Three probable recurrences
occurred within the first month after transplantation, and
all had nephrotic range proteinuria. All recurrences
occurred in patients with idiopathic FSGS (group III;
P <0.01). Median amount of proteinuria at the time of
graft biopsy in patients with a recurrence was 5.0 g/day
(interquartile range 3.6 - 6.9 g/day). The median time to
recurrence was 6 days (0–2082 days) after transplantation.
In two patients the diagnosis of recurrence was made
more than six months after renal transplantation. The first
patient, a 32-year old woman, had a probable recurrence
more than five years after transplantation after cyclos￾porine monotherapy was replaced by azathioprine and
prednisone because of cyclosporine toxicity. Shortly there￾after massive proteinuria occurred. Initiation of plasma

exchange led to a remission of proteinuria, however
prolonged plasma exchange was necessary to sustain the
remission of proteinuria. The other late recurrence was a
definite recurrence which occurred four years after trans￾plantation in an 18 year-old patient. No inciting event was
found. He was treated with ACE-inhibitors and had only
slight proteinuria and a reasonable graft function after a
follow-up of 17 years.
Compared to patients without a recurrence, delayed
graft function occurred more often in patients with re￾current FSGS, although this difference did not reach
statistical significance (25% vs. 12%, P =0.13). Patients
with recurrent FSGS had significantly more biopsy￾proven acute rejection episodes (54% vs. 27%, P =0.02).
There were no significant differences in HLA-mismatches
and immunosuppressive regimens. Graft survival at
five years was significantly lower in patients with re￾current FSGS compared to patients without a recur￾rence (50% vs. 82%; P <0.01). Plasma exchange for the
treatment of recurrent FSGS was introduced in 1994.
We have previously shown an improved outcome in
patients treated with plasma exchange compared to
historical controls [18]. In the current study nine out
of 28 patients with recurrences were treated with
plasma exchange.
Clinical prediction of recurrent FSGS
To determine clinical factors associated with FSGS re￾currence, we compared baseline characteristics of
patients in group III with and without a recurrence of
FSGS (Table 2). Patients with familial or secondary FSGS
were excluded because a recurrence did not occur in
these patient groups. Patients with a recurrence had a
significantly lower serum albumin, higher 24-hour pro￾teinuria and higher eGFR at diagnosis (Table 2). They
also had a shorter interval between presentation and
renal biopsy than patients without a recurrence. The
interval between first renal biopsy and end-stage renal
disease did not differ significantly between patients with
and without a recurrence, nor did age at diagnosis and
donor age.
Serum albumin, eGFR and 24-hour proteinuria were
analyzed as predictors in the binary probit model. Be￾cause there was significant multicollinearity between

albumin and 24-hour proteinuria, these parameters were
analyzed separately with eGFR. In the complete case
analysis of eGFR and serum albumin (n=39), serum al￾bumin was an independent predictor with a relative risk
of 0.93 per incremental g/l (95% confidence interval
0.88-0.98). In the complete case analysis of eGFR and
24-hour proteinuria (n=26), 24-hour proteinuria was a
significant predictor with a relative risk of 1.36 per in￾cremental g/24 hours (95% confidence interval 1.05-
1.77). eGFR was a significant but weak predictor in the
complete case analysis. After imputation serum albumin
was the only independent predictor of a recurrence with
a relative risk 0.92 per incremental g/l (95% confidence
interval 0.88-0.96).
The percentage of recurrences by serum albumin level
at diagnosis in the idiopathic FSGS group is shown in
Table 3. The ROC curve for the predictive value of
serum albumin at diagnosis for FSGS recurrence is
shown in Figure 1.
Discussion
Many factors have been associated with recurrence of
FSGS after renal transplantation, including a young age
at diagnosis, a rapid progression to end-stage renal di￾sease, loss of a previous renal graft from recurrent
disease, and prior bilateral nephrectomy [3,4,6,15,27].
Except for recurrence in a previous graft none of these
factors is highly predictive in an individual patient [28].
Since recurrent FSGS has been associated with a circu￾lating plasma factor, in vitro determination of plasma
factor(s) that induce permeability to albumin in isolated
glomeruli has also been used to predict recurrence
[6,16]. Although initial reports showed good correlations
between in vitro tests and recurrent disease in renal
grafts, later studies reported less robust correlations and
less specificity [29]. Recently, Wei et al. have described
serum soluble urokinase receptor (suPAR) as a circulat￾ing factor that may cause FSGS [17]. They reported that
higher concentrations of suPAR before transplantation
are associated with an increased risk for recurrence after
transplantation. However, there was a large degree of
overlap between pretransplant suPAR in patients with
recurrent and nonrecurrent FSGS. We have recently
shown that suPAR is not a specific marker for idiopathic
FSGS [30]. In the absence of a reliable diagnostic test
that can predict FSGS recurrence after transplantation,
we evaluated whether clinical criteria can improve
pretransplant risk assessment.
In our study FSGS recurred only in patients assigned
to group III (idiopathic FSGS). In this group recurrence
rate was 42%. The lower recurrence rate reported in
many studies may be related to inclusion of patients
with secondary/genetic FSGS [3-5,9]. Except for patients
with congenital nephrotic syndrome (NPSH1) in which
anti-nephrin antibodies may be involved, FSGS rarely
recurs in patients with genetic FSGS [31,32]. With the
identification of mutations in podocyte-associated genes
it has become apparent that an increasing number of
patients originally thought to have idiopathic FSGS, ac￾tually have a form of genetic FSGS [2]. In children with
FSGS, genetic testing strategy in our center has involved
sequential testing for all mutations known at the time.
Most children in this cohort received a transplant before
any FSGS associated mutations were identified. In adult￾onset sporadic FSGS, most of the currently known FSGS
associated mutations are rare [33]. Still, we cannot ex￾clude the possibility that some patients assigned to our
group III in fact had an unidentified genetic mutation.
In the early phase of recurrent FSGS after transplant￾ation, glomeruli often appear normal on light micros￾copy, but display diffuse foot process effacement on
electron microscopy. We used a definition of a probable
recurrence if glomeruli appeared normal but electron
microscopy was not performed. Nevertheless, recurrent
FSGS was in fact the most likely diagnosis in these cases,

as all patients had nephrotic range proteinuria. More￾over, previous studies have used similar definitions [13].
Although acute antibody mediated rejection can cause
postttansplant proteinuria, we consider this an unlikely
event. There was no evidence of acute transplant
glomerulopathy in light microscopy, and in available bi￾opsies C4d stainings were negative.
Risk factor analysis using a binary probit model identi￾fied serum albumin at diagnosis as an independent pre￾dictor of recurrence. In patients with idiopathic FSGS
(group III) and a serum albumin <25 g/l at diagnosis re￾currence rate was high (78%), whereas FSGS did not
recur in patients with a normal serum albumin (>35 g/l)
at diagnosis. This finding supports the present notion
among many clinicians that a more severe nephrotic
syndrome in patients with FSGS is associated with a
higher recurrence risk. To our knowledge, this is the
first study to demonstrate the predictive value of serum
albumin at diagnosis in recurrent FSGS. This is likely
due to the fact that previous studies have never reported
pretransplant serum albumin.
Admittedly, serum albumin was not available in 22
patients with idiopathic FSGS which may have biased
results. To account for these missing values, we used
imputed values in the binary probit model. It has been
shown that a properly performed multiple imputation
gives less biased results compared to traditional
complete case analysis [34]. Recurrence after transplant￾ation was used as a predictor variable because multiple
imputation with the outcome has been shown to yield
more valid results [25].
Previously, Praga et al. showed that a normal serum al￾bumin was suggestive of FSGS secondary to hyper￾filtration in patients with FSGS in their native kidneys
and nephrotic range proteinuria. Hyperfiltration in these
patients was due to severe obesity (BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2
),
vesicoureteral reflux, or renal mass reduction. In our
study, none of the children were obese, and none of the
adult patients in the idiopathic FSGS group had a body
mass index over 35 kg/m2
. Moreover, patients with re￾flux or renal mass reduction were assigned to group II.
Nevertheless, it is possible that at least some of the
patients in group III, specifically those with a normal
serum albumin and nephrotic range proteinuria at diag￾nosis, had glomerular hyperfiltration that would not be
expected to recur in the renal transplant. Because we
were unable to identify an underlying secondary cause
with certainty, we assigned these patients to group III
(idiopathic FSGS). In daily clinical practice these patients
would also be diagnosed with idiopathic FSGS.
In the past, living related donor transplantations have
often been avoided in patients with FSGS, because of
fear that recurrent FSGS in the renal allograft would
lead to premature graft loss. However, this fear has
become less justified since therapeutic plasma exchange
has been shown to improve outcome in patients with re￾current FSGS. Moreover, data from the USRDS study
revealed that living related donor transplantation has no
association with graft loss from recurrent FSGS [35]. Ra￾ther, living related donor transplant is associated with a
graft survival advantage for living donor kidneys over
deceased donor kidneys. Furthermore, as confirmed by
our study, the rate of recurrence among recipients of liv￾ing or deceased donor kidneys is similar [5,9,14,36-38].
The immunosuppressive regimen did not influence the
risk of recurrent disease in our study. In particular, the
use of cyclosporine was not associated with a decreased
recurrence rate. In children, there is limited evidence
that recurrent FSGS can be successfully treated with
high-dose intravenous or oral cyclosporin [39,40]. How￾ever, cyclosporine does not appear to prevent recurrence
in the transplant when given as part of the initial im￾munosuppressive regimen [38,41,42].
A rapid clinical course to end-stage renal disease, a
previously reported risk factor for recurrence, did not in￾fluence the recurrence rate in our study [4,14,15,37].
Several other studies also observed no differences be￾tween the rapidity of progression of the initial disease
and recurrent disease [5,7-9,38]. Although speculative,
differences in pre-transplant immunosuppressive therapy
may help explain the discrepancy between the above
mentioned studies. Pardon et al. and Hickson et al.
showed that recurrent disease occurred more often in
patients treated with cyclosporine before transplantation,
whereas time to end stage renal disease did not influence
recurrence rate [7,8]. Although these patients eventually
developed end-stage renal disease, cyclosporine may
have slowed progression by reducing proteinuria. As re￾cently shown, cyclosporine can reduce proteinuria due
to a direct effect on podocyte function, which appears to
be related to a stabilization of the actin cytoskeleton in
podocytes [43]. In contrast, these patients may progress
rapidly to end-stage renal disease if not treated with
cyclosporine.
Several investigators have identified bilateral nephrec￾tomy before transplantation as a risk factor for recur￾rence [4,27]. This may reflect a more aggressive disease
with a higher propensity to recur. In our study, we were
not able to confirm this finding because bilateral neph￾rectomy was only performed in six patients. We only ad￾vise nephrectomy in patients with end-stage renal
disease and severe, persistent nephrotic syndrome re￾fractory to medical treatment.
Recurrent FSGS was associated with decreased graft
survival: within five years, half of the patients with recur￾rent FSGS lost their renal graft compared to only 18% of
patients without recurrent FSGS. It is important to note
that most patients included in our cohort were
Maas et al. BMC Nephrology 2013, 14:47 Page 6 of 8

transplanted in the era before plasma exchange was ap￾plied as treatment of FSGS recurrence. We and others
have shown that sustained remissions resulting in better
renal survival can be attained after treatment with
plasma exchange [18,19,41]. The higher incidence of
acute rejection episodes in patients with FSGS recur￾rence may also have contributed to their decreased graft
survival. In addition to acute rejections, delayed graft
function also appeared to occur more often in patients
with recurrent FSGS, although this difference was not
statistically significant. It is not clear how FSGS recur￾rence, delayed graft function, and acute rejection are
intertwined. Kim et al. reported that both recurrence of
FSGS and delayed graft function were independently
associated with an increased incidence of acute rejection
in patients with end-stage renal disease due to FSGS
[44]. Furthermore, there was an increased rate of early
graft dysfunction in their FSGS patients, which was
assumed to be a consequence of immediate recurrence.
In our study, the increased number of acute rejection
episodes may be due to a higher surveillance rate.
Patients with an FSGS recurrence had a mean of 1.5
renal graft biopsies per patient in the first year after
transplantation, whereas the patients without a recur￾rence had only 0.5 biopsies.
Conclusions
Clinical criteria can identify a group of patients at high
risk for recurrent FSGS after renal transplantation.
Serum albumin at diagnosis predicts recurrence rate
with a 78% risk of recurrence in patients with serum al￾bumin concentration <25 g/l. Admittedly our study is
limited by the retrospective design and missing data.
Prospective studies are needed to confirm our findings.
Nevertheless, our data can already be used to provide
better counseling of patients with FSGS before renal
transplantation. High risk patients should be closely
monitored for proteinuria, especially in the first weeks
after transplantation, to enable early initiation of plasma
exchange.
