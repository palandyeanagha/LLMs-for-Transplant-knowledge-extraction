SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS
Monitoring, precautions and complications
▸ All patients undergoing bronchoscopy should have
heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure and
oxygen saturation recorded repeatedly, including
before, during and after the procedure. (Grade D)
▸ All bronchoscopy units should undertake peri￾odic audit of bronchoscopic performance,
including efficacy, complications and patient sat￾isfaction surveys. (Good practice point (√))
▸ All Trusts should have a ‘safe sedation policy’,
and ensure all bronchoscopy unit staff, including
trainees, receive appropriate training. (√)
Hypoxaemia
▸ Patients should be monitored by continuous
pulse oximetry during bronchoscopy. (Grade C)
▸ Oxygen supplementation should be used when
desaturation is significant (pulse oximeter oxygen
saturation (SpO2)>4% change, or SpO2<90%)
and prolonged (>1 min) to reduce the risk of
hypoxaemia-related complications. (Grade D)
▸ The risks of hypoxaemia-related complications
are associated with baseline arterial oxygen sat￾uration (SaO2) and lung function, comorbidity,
sedation and procedural sampling. Fitness for
bronchoscopy should incorporate an assessment
of these elements, and appropriate monitoring
and preprocedure optimisation. (Grade D)
Cardiac arrhythmias
▸ Continuous ECG monitoring should be used
when there is a high clinical risk of arrhythmia.
(Grade D)
▸ When there is a high risk of arrhythmia, oxygen
saturations, pulse rate and blood pressure should
be optimised. Appropriate aftercare monitoring
and instructions should be given. (Grade D)
▸ Resuscitation equipment should be readily avail￾able. (√)
▸ Intravenous access should be established before
sedation is given and maintained until discharge.
(√)
Bleeding complications
▸ Perform coagulation studies, platelet count and
haemoglobin concentration when there are clinical
risk factors for abnormal coagulation. (Grade D)
▸ Bronchoscopy with lavage can be performed with
platelet counts >20 000 per μL. Liaise with the
local haematology team regarding the need for
platelet transfusion before bronchoscopy if
endobronchial biopsy (EBB) or transbronchial lung
biopsy (TBLB) is planned. (Grade D)
▸ Discontinue clopidogrel 7 days prior to consid￾eration of EBB and TBLB. Low-dose aspirin
alone can be continued. (Grade C)
▸ Anticoagulants should be managed according
to published guidelines as set out in appendix 7
of this guideline. (√)
▸ The risk of biopsy needs to be weighed against
the potential for benefit and appropriate
informed consent obtained. (√)
Pneumothorax
▸ A chest radiograph should be obtained if a
patient is symptomatic or there is a clinical sus￾picion of possible pneumothorax after TBLB.
(Grade D)
▸ Fluoroscopic screening may improve diagnostic
yield of TBLB in focal but not diffuse lung
disease. (Grade D)
▸ Patients should be advised of the potential for
delayed complications following TBLB and pro￾vided with written information regarding likely
symptoms and action required. (Grade D)
Fever and infection
▸ Patients should receive written information
regarding post-bronchoscopy fever (PBF) and
appropriate management advice. (Grade C)
▸ Antibiotic prophylaxis is not warranted before
bronchoscopy for the prevention of endocardi￾tis, fever or pneumonia. (Grade B)
SAFETY OF FLEXIBLE BRONCHOSCOPY IN
SPECIFIC MEDICAL CONDITIONS
Asthma
▸ Patients’ asthma control should be optimised prior
to bronchoscopy, especially when bronchoalveolar
lavage (BAL) is likely to be performed. (Grade C)
▸ Nebulised bronchodilators should be considered
before bronchoscopy in patients with asthma.
(√)
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
▸ Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
treatment should be optimised prior to bron￾choscopy when possible. (Grade D)
▸ Bronchoscopists should be cautious when sedat￾ing patients with COPD. (Grade D)
Ischaemic heart disease
▸ Liaison with cardiologists should be considered
in high-risk patients with cardiac disease and if

flexible bronchoscopy (FB) is indicated within 4–6 weeks
after myocardial infarction (MI). (Grade D)
▸ FB should ideally be delayed for 4 weeks after MI. (Grade D)
Haemoptysis
▸ Consider bronchoscopy after a normal CT if the patient is
high risk for lung carcinoma or if the haemoptysis continues.
(Grade D)
Older patients
▸ Age alone should not be a contraindication for bronchos￾copy. (Grade D)
▸ The older patient may require reduced doses of benzodiaze￾pines/opioids sedation. (Grade D)
Patients who are immunosuppressed
▸ When a diagnosis is not likely to be obtained through non￾invasive measures, bronchoscopy with BAL can be consid￾ered to provide diagnostic information. (Grade C)
▸ TBLB is helpful in lung transplant recipients when rejection
is a possibility. (Grade C)
SEDATION
Premedication
▸ Anticholinergics (glycopyrrolate or atropine) should not rou￾tinely be used prior to bronchoscopy due to a lack of clinical
benefit and a possible increased risk of haemodynamic
changes. (Grade A)
▸ Premedication for bronchoscopy is not routinely indicated.
(Grade C)
Sedation
▸ Intravenous sedation should be offered to patients undergo￾ing bronchoscopy, provided there are no contraindications.
(Grade B)
▸ Some patients will tolerate unsedated bronchoscopy well,
and patient preference should be sought. (Grade B)
▸ Sedative drugs should be titrated to provide the desired
depth of sedation, given significant inter-patient variability in
required doses. (Grade B)
▸ The desired depth of sedation is one in which verbal contact
is possible at all times. (Grade D)
▸ Bronchoscopists are encouraged to document an assessment
of sedation depth as part of the procedural report. (√)
Benzodiazepines
▸ Intravenous midazolam is the preferred drug for sedation,
having a rapid onset of action, being titratable to provide the
required depth of sedation, and being reversible. (Grade B)
▸ No more than 5 mg midazolam should be initially drawn up
into any syringe prior to bronchoscopy for patients under the
age of 70 (2 mg midazolam for patients over 70) to prevent
potential inadvertent oversedation associated with the practice
of routinely drawing up 10 mg midazolam. (Grade D)
▸ Only low-strength midazolam (1 mg/mL) should be available
within bronchoscopy suites. High-strength midazolam (2 mg/
mL or 5 mg/mL) should be restricted to general anaesthesia,
intensive care and other areas where its use has been for￾mally risk assessed. (Grade D)
Propofol
▸ While propofol has similar efficacy to midazolam, it should
only be used when administered by practitioners formally
trained in its administration (eg, anaesthetists) since it has a
narrow therapeutic window beyond which general anaesthe￾sia is achieved. (Grade B)
Opioids
▸ Combination opioid and midazolam sedation should be con￾sidered in patients to improve bronchoscopic tolerance.
(Grade B)
▸ When opioids are used, short-acting agents (such as fentanyl
or alfentanil) should be used to minimise post-procedural
sedation. (Grade D)
▸ When combination sedatives are used, opioids should be
administered first and allowed time to become maximally
effective before administration of any other agent. (Grade D)
Topical anaesthesia
▸ Lidocaine should be used for topical anaesthesia during
bronchoscopy, unless contraindicated. (Grade A)
▸ Nasal topical anaesthesia is most effectively provided using
2% lidocaine gel. (Grade A)
▸ Both cricothyroid and spray-as-you-go techniques are effect￾ive in delivering lidocaine to the vocal cords and trachea.
(Grade B)
▸ Nebulisation is not recommended as a technique for deliver￾ing lidocaine to the airways. (Grade B)
▸ 1% lidocaine solution should be used for spray-as-you-go
administration. (Grade A)
▸ To reduce the risk of lidocaine toxicity, bronchoscopists
should use the lowest dose of lidocaine sufficient to prevent
excessive coughing and provide patient comfort. (Grade D)
▸ Bronchoscopists should remain vigilant for objective and sub￾jective symptoms of lidocaine toxicity, particularly given sig￾nificant inter-patient variability in lidocaine absorption and
metabolism. (Grade B)
▸ Bronchoscopists should monitor and document the total
lidocaine dose delivered at all sites during bronchoscopy. (√)
Sampling and diagnostic accuracy
▸ Bronchoscopists should maintain a record of their personal
diagnostic accuracy for FB. (√)
Lung cancer
▸ A diagnostic level of 85% should be attainable when definite
endobronchial tumour is visible. (Grade B)
▸ At least five biopsy samples should be taken when endobron￾chial tumour is visible to maximise diagnostic yield and the
volume of biopsy tissue and to allow for tumour phenotyp￾ing and genotyping. (Grade D)
▸ When endobronchial tumour is visible, brushings and wash￾ings can increase the diagnostic yield of the procedure.
(Grade D)
▸ A chest CT scan should be performed prior to a diagnostic bron￾choscopy in patients with suspected lung cancer. (Grade D)
Interstitial lung disease
▸ In suspected sarcoidosis, EBBs should be considered to
increase the diagnostic yield. (Grade C)
▸ TBLB is recommended for the diagnosis of stage II–IV sar￾coidosis. (Grade C)
▸ In patients with diffuse interstitial lung disease (ILD), five to
six TBLBs should be taken from the same lung. (Grade D)

▸ Fluoroscopy should be considered for TBLB in patients with
localised or focal parenchymal lung disease. (Grade D)
Diagnosis of infection
Patients who are immunocompromised
▸ In patients with pulmonary infiltrates who are immunocom￾promised and in whom tuberculosis (TB) is considered
unlikely, BAL alone is usually sufficient to achieve a diagno￾sis. In areas or populations with high prevalence of TB,
TBLB may be considered in addition. (Grade C)
▸ BAL or bronchial washings should be sent for microscopy for
acid fast bacteria (AFB) and for mycobacterial culture in patients
with pneumonia who are immunocompromised. (Grade C)
▸ Post-bronchoscopy sputum could be collected in patients
who are immunocompromised and suspected to have TB.
(Grade D)
▸ TBLB and EBB for invasive aspergillosis may be avoided if
BAL galactomannan test is available due to the high sensitiv￾ity and specificity of the latter and inherent risks with the
biopsies. (Grade C)
▸ In patients suspected to have invasive aspergillosis, BAL
should be sent for microscopy for hyphae and fungal
culture; a BAL galactomannan test should be considered to
further improve diagnostic yield. (Grade C)
Patients who are immunocompetent
▸ Bronchoscopy may be considered in patients with non-resolving
or slowly resolving pneumonia, especially if they are current or
ex smokers and older than 50 years. (Grade C)
▸ If bronchoscopy is performed for community-acquired pneu￾monia, BAL specimens should be sent for legionella PCR
and atypical pathogens. (Grade C)
▸ Bronchoscopy may be considered if the patient is suspected
to have TB when sputum smear is negative. (Grade C)
▸ In cases of suspected TB, BAL, bronchial aspirates and post￾bronchoscopy sputum appear to be complementary and
should all be analysed. (Grade C)
▸ In areas with high or intermediate prevalence of TB, patients
undergoing bronchoscopy for another indication should have
samples sent routinely for cultures for TB. (Grade C)
INTENSIVE CARE UNITS
▸ The external diameter of a bronchoscope used in the intensive
care unit (ICU) setting should be carefully selected according to
the external diameter of the bronchoscope, the size of the
airway support device (endotracheal tube (ET) or laryngeal
mask) and the type of airway device used. (Grade D)
▸ Prophylactic bronchoscopy and lavage should not be used to
prevent post-lobectomy atelectasis in ventilated patients.
(Grade A)
▸ Bronchoscopy may be considered in specific circumstances
for the relief of atelectasis in intubated and ventilated
patients. (Grade D)
▸ Bronchoscopy may be considered in ventilated patients with
haemoptysis if CT imaging has been performed and is
unhelpful, or is not possible. (Grade D)
▸ Directed non-invasive diagnostic strategies (eg, blind catheter
aspiration) should be used first line in preference to bron￾choscopy in ventilated patients with suspected ventilator￾associated pneumonia. (Grade A)
▸ When such non-invasive diagnostic techniques fail to identify a
responsible organism, bronchoscopy should be considered for
the diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia. (Grade D)
▸ Patients in the ICU should be considered at high risk from
complications when undergoing bronchoscopy. (Grade D)
▸ All potential risk factors (ventilator parameters, clotting dys￾function) should be corrected as far as possible before under￾taking bronchoscopy. (Grade D)
▸ The risks and benefits of bronchoscopy should be carefully
considered in mechanically ventilated patients. (√)
▸ Continuous multimodal physiological monitoring should
occur during and after bronchoscopy in the ICU setting.
(Grade C)
▸ Patients should be monitored after the procedure for compli￾cations, including pneumothorax, even when a biopsy has
not been taken. (Grade D)
▸ Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) plus oxygen
support may be considered in patients with hypoxia under￾going bronchoscopy to prevent desaturation and post￾procedure requirement for mechanical ventilation. (Grade B)
▸ When patients require non-invasive ventilation prior to bron￾choscopy, the procedure should be conducted in an environ￾ment where intubation and ventilatory support are readily
accessible. (Grade D)
▸ Bronchoscopy should be undertaken cautiously in patients
with documented or suspected raised intracranial pressure
(ICP). (Grade D)
▸ Care must be exercised to ensure adequate ventilation and
oxygenation is maintained during bronchoscopy in intubated
patients. (√)
▸ Adequate sedation and analgesia should be provided for
patients undergoing bronchoscopy in an intensive care
setting. The risks of these procedures should be carefully
balanced with their potential benefit in ventilated patients.
(Grade D)
▸ Clinicians administering sedation/anaesthesia/analgesia
should be acquainted with the use of these agents, and the
anaesthetist/intensivist is usually best placed to fulfil this role.
(Grade D)
DISINFECTION
▸ All personnel involved in cleaning and decontaminating
bronchoscopes must receive specific training in infection
control practices and decontamination processes. (Grade D)
▸ Decontamination and disinfection should be carried out at
the beginning and end of each list and after each patient use.
If drying cabinets or storage chambers are unavailable
bronchoscopes should be decontaminated no more than 3 h
before the procedure to eliminate colonisation of pathogens.
(Grade D)
▸ Bronchoscopes should be cleaned in designated cleaning
areas. Used scopes must be separated from clean scopes to
prevent cross contamination. (Grade D)
▸ Thorough cleaning, brushing and flushing of all accessible
channels with enzymatic or low foaming detergent remains
the most important initial stage of the cleaning process.
(Grade D)
▸ Single-use suction valves should replace reusable valves wher￾ever possible. Single-use valves must be discarded after each
procedure. (Grade D)
▸ Reusable valves should be used only with one bronchoscope
and stored alongside the scope for traceability. (Grade D)
▸ Single-use accessories should be selected over reusable acces￾sories wherever possible. (Grade D)
▸ When it is necessary to use reusable accessories they must be
cleaned according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.

recommendations. (Grade D)
▸ When drying cabinets or storage chambers are not available,
bronchoscopes must be stored in a hanging position, with
sufficient space between instruments to avoid cross contamin￾ation. (Grade D)
▸ Valves must not be attached to bronchoscopes during
storage. (Grade D)
▸ Bronchoscopes must be cleaned and disinfected before and
after placing in carrying cases as these cases cannot be disin￾fected. Bronchoscopes should not be stored in carrying cases.
(Grade D)
▸ A record must be kept of each bronchoscope and reusable
accessory used on each individual patient. Tracking each step
of the decontamination cycle and personnel involved should
also be recorded. This will facilitate tracing if an increase in
contamination by organisms is identified amongst bronchos￾copy patients. (Grade D)
▸ AERs should be self-disinfected at the beginning of each day.
(Grade D)
▸ AERs must be validated on instillation and following intro￾duction of new disinfectants according to Health Technical
Memorandum 01 (HTM-01). (Grade D)
▸ Sterile water or filtered water should be used for the final
rinse. Tap water is not recommended. (Grade D)
▸ Regular testing of AERs and final rinse water for mycobac￾teria must be carried out according to HTM-01. (Grade D)
▸ Compatibility of bronchoscopes with disinfectant and AER
manufacturers’ instruction should be checked. (√)

INTRODUCTION
Clinical context and need for a guideline
Flexible bronchoscopy (FB) is a safe and frequently performed
procedure for the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of
patients with respiratory disease. The procedure and applica￾tions of FB have progressively evolved and expanded since it
was first introduced in 1968.1 FB is now established as an essen￾tial diagnostic and therapeutic tool in respiratory medicine.
The British Thoracic Society (BTS) published the 2001 guide￾lines on diagnostic FB.2 This document is well respected, used
and referenced in the UK and beyond. Literature searches for
the 2001 guideline were completed in 1999, but numerous
studies have been published in this field since, providing
adequate information to revise and update the evidenced-based
recommendations.

In August 2007 the Standards of Care Committee (SOCC) of
the BTS invited the interventional pulmonology specialist advis￾ory group of the BTS to produce evidence-based guidelines for
advanced diagnostic and therapeutic FB and to update and
revise the 2001 BTS guideline on diagnostic FB.2 The working
party decided to start with the new guideline on advanced diag￾nostic and therapeutic FB which was published in November
2011.3 The proposal to update and revise the BTS guideline on
diagnostic FB was approved by the BTS SOCC in November
2010 and work on the guideline started in February 2011.
Appendix 1 of this guideline lists the members of the BTS
Bronchoscopy Guideline Group.
Target audience of the guideline
This guideline is aimed primarily at respiratory practitioners in
the UK but may be of relevance to other healthcare systems
around the world. It is intended to inform those who undertake
or intend to undertake FB and procedures described within the
guideline, and to inform other healthcare professionals as to
what may be the indications, procedures, likely response and
complications of FB in adults. Practitioners using this guideline
need to ensure that they follow safe practices and keep patient
safety paramount at all times.
Scope of the guideline
This guideline was formulated following consultation with sta￾keholders from the medical and nursing professions, patient
groups and healthcare management. Basic diagnostic procedures
in adults using a flexible bronchoscope are included in the
guideline.
Topics covered in the guideline
▸ Monitoring of a patient during the procedure.
▸ Specific precautions, contraindications and complications.
▸ Sedation, premedication and topical anaesthesia.
▸ FB in specific patient groups.
▸ Role of bronchoscopy in infections.
▸ FB in the ICU.
▸ Cleaning and disinfection of equipment.
▸ Staffing and staff safety.
▸ Diagnostic accuracy and specific procedures.
▸ Patient satisfaction and patient care.
Topics not covered in the guideline
▸ Training in bronchoscopy (The BTS is producing separate
guidance on training).
▸ Advanced diagnostic and therapeutic FB.3
▸ Rigid bronchoscopy.
▸ FB used for intubation, percutaneous tracheostomy place￾ments and intraoperative complications.
▸ Paediatric FB.
▸ FB performed under general anaesthetic.
METHODOLOGY
This guideline is based on the best available evidence and is a
revised update of the BTS guideline on diagnostic FB2 published
in 2001. The methodology used to write the guideline adheres
strictly to the criteria as set by the BTS guideline production
manual and the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and
Evaluation (AGREE) collaboration in the document ‘The
AGREE Instrument’, which is available online: http://www.
agreecollaboration.org/1/agreeguide/
Clinical questions and literature search
Clinical questions were gathered in the PICOT (Patient,
Intervention, Control, Outcome and Time) format to define the
scope of the guideline and inform the literature search.
Systematic electronic database searches were conducted to
identify potentially relevant studies for inclusion in the guide￾line. For each topic area the following databases were searched:
Ovid MEDLINE (from 1988) (including MEDLINE In Process),
Ovid EMBASE (from 1988), Ovid CINAHL (from 1982) and
the Cochrane Library (from 1992) (including the Cochrane
Database of Systematic Reviews, the Database of Abstracts of
Reviews of Effects, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
Trials, the Health Technology Assessment database and the NHS
Economic Evaluation Database). The search strategies are avail￾able in appendix 2.
The searches were first run in January 2011 and were
updated in January 2012 and June 2012. Searches were saved
and alerts sent via email on a monthly basis to identify newly
published literature to date. Searches included a combination of
indexed terms and free text terms, and were limited to English
language publications only. The initial search identified 22 865
potential papers.
Appraisal of the literature
Appraisal was performed using the criteria stipulated by the
AGREE collaboration. One individual (IDR) read the title and
abstract of each article retrieved by the literature searches and
decided whether the paper was (1) definitely relevant, (2) pos￾sibly relevant or (3) not relevant to the project. A total of 9121
papers were identified to review for inclusion of the guideline.
Criteria formulated for initial screening of the abstracts into
these three groups were:
▸ Whether the study addressed the clinical question.
▸ Whether the appropriate study type was used to produce the
best evidence to answer the clinical question.
▸ Abstract was in English.
▸ Studies in which exclusively rigid bronchoscopy was used
were not evaluated.
▸ Abstracts were not rejected on the basis of the journal of
publication, country in which the research was performed or
published or the date of publication.
The full paper was obtained for all relevant or possibly rele￾vant abstracts and allocated to the relevant section(s):
▸ Sedation, premedication and topical anaesthesia.
▸ Monitoring, precautions, contraindications and complications.
▸ Specific conditions.
▸ Bronchoscopy in the ICU.
▸ Infections.
▸ Cleaning, disinfecting and staff safety.
▸ Diagnostic accuracy.
▸ Patient satisfaction and consent.
The first screening process identified 9121 abstracts to be
reviewed, 1824 abstracts did not meet the criteria as set out
above, 1504 studies used FB to collect samples for research pur￾poses and 1731 case reports in FB were identified. Two guide￾line reviewers independently reviewed the abstracts of the
remaining 4062 studies to identify 2197 papers to be appraised
for the guideline. The two leads for each section independently
appraised each paper assigned to them using the Scottish
Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) critical appraisal
checklists. A web-based guideline development tool (http://www.
bronchoscopy-guideline.org, designed by IDR) was used for
1505 critical appraisals of 522 studies. The website enabled

appraisal checklists and is shown in the evidence tables (++, +
or −). The body of evidence for each recommendation was sum￾marised into evidence statements and graded using the SIGN
grading system (see table 1). Disagreements were resolved by
discussion with the section partner and the Guideline Group.
Considered judgement and grading of the evidence
The Guideline Group used the online derived evidence tables to
judge the body of evidence and grade recommendations for this
guideline. The evidence tables are available in appendix 3 for
review and are published electronically on the BTS website.
When evidence was lacking to answer the formulated clinical
questions, expert opinions were obtained for formal consensus
statements using the Delphi method.
The following were considered in grading the recommendations:
▸ The available volume of the body of evidence.
▸ How applicable the obtained evidence was in making recom￾mendations for the defined target audience of this guideline.
▸ Whether the evidence was generalisable to the target popula￾tion for the guideline.
▸ Whether there was a clear consistency in the evidence
obtained to support recommendations.
▸ What the implications of recommendations will be on clin￾ical practice in terms of recourses and skilled expertise.
▸ Cost effectiveness was not reviewed in detail as in-depth eco￾nomic analysis of recommendations falls beyond the scope of
this guideline.
Recommendations were graded from A to D according to the
strength of the evidence, as listed in table 2. Important practical
points lacking any research evidence were highlighted as ‘good
practice points’ (√).
The grading system used to grade recommendations for this
revised guideline differs from the system used to grade the
recommendations for the 2001 BTS guideline on diagnostic FB,
shown in table 3. Readers of the guideline are therefore advised
to review both grading systems and to note that apparent
changes in recommendations between guidelines may be due to
the use of different grading systems rather than a change in the
recommendation itself.
Drafting of the guideline
The Guideline Group corresponded regularly by email and
meetings of the full group were held in February 2011,
September 2011, December 2011, March 2012, May 2012 and
June 2012. The guideline was discussed at an open session at
the BTS Summer Meeting in July 2012. A revised draft guide￾line document was circulated to all the relevant stakeholders for
consultation in July 2012 followed by a period of online con￾sultation. The BTS SOCC reviewed the draft guideline in June
2012. A list of stakeholders is available for review in appendix 4
of this guideline.

AUDIT AND RESEARCH RECOMMENDATIONS
Audit:
▸ All those undertaking FB are advised to maintain personal
records of each procedure, including indication, outcome
and complications for audit purposes.
▸ Periodic audit of bronchoscopy practice, including patient
satisfaction surveys.
Research:
▸ Utility of all bronchoscopic samples, including brush and
BAL for phenotyping and genotyping in patients with
advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
▸ Randomised assessment of the utility of bronchoscopy in the
relief of lobar collapse/atelectasis in ventilated patients.
▸ Further assessment of the use of jet ventilation during bron￾choscopy in mechanically ventilated patients.
▸ Further assessment of optimal analgesia and sedation for safe
bronchoscopy in mechanically ventilated patients.
Training
Training in FB does not fall in the scope of this guideline.
Audit standards
The following standards provide criteria which may form the
basis of future audits:
▸ A serious adverse event rate of <1% (box 1).
▸ A ‘safe sedation policy’ and appropriate training in sedation
for all bronchoscopy unit staff, including trainees and inter￾val audit of sedation practice.
▸ Utilisation of the bronchoscopy safety checklist (see appendix
5).
▸ An 85% diagnostic rate for FB with visible endobronchial
tumour.
▸ Periodic patient feedback to inform improvement and revi￾sion of the endoscopy service.
MONITORING, PRECAUTIONS AND COMPLICATIONS
FB is an increasingly important diagnostic, well tolerated pro￾cedure that can be performed safely on an outpatient basis. In
the largest retrospective series (n=20 986), serious complica￾tions occurred in 1.1% with a mortality of 0.02%.4 The com￾monest adverse events reported, though not universally in all
studies, included tachycardia/bradycardia, major and minor
bleeding, bronchospasm/laryngospasm, cough, dyspnoea, sore
throat, apnoea, seizure, desaturation, pneumothorax and pul￾monary oedema. Other smaller studies report complication rates
of 5–32%, and mortality rates of 0–0.8%, but these studies are
limited by their retrospective nature, the variable definition of
adverse events and limited follow up.
Smaller prospective studies suggest that the rate of adverse
events may be higher than previously reported. Hehn et al5
demonstrated respiratory complications in 4.3%, non￾respiratory complications in 2.8% and mortality in 0.1%. In
addition, Bechara et al6 reported adverse events in 35% of 300
bronchoscopies performed, 60% of which were classified as
mild and 8% as severe. Approximately 6% of patients were hos￾pitalised and procedure-related deaths occurred in 1.4%.6
There is an increased risk of adverse events with increasing
age but the absolute frequency is low. Chronological age should
not be a contraindication for bronchoscopy.5 7 Patient position
during the procedure does not influence complication rates,
with the exception that desaturation >4% is more common in
the sitting position.8
Many factors will influence the risk of complications, includ￾ing patient characteristics and factors related to the broncho￾scopic unit (including sedation practice and the sampling
procedures employed). Utilisation of a WHO safety
checklist aids in identifying specific possible complications (see
appendix 5) Complications, particularly serious adverse events
(box 1), patient satisfaction and efficacy should be routinely
monitored by every bronchoscopy unit.
Recommendation
▸ All patients undergoing bronchoscopy should have heart
rate, blood pressure and oxygen saturation recorded repeat￾edly, including before, during and after the procedure.
(Grade D)
Good practice points
▸ All bronchoscopy units should undertake periodic audit of
bronchoscopic performance, including efficacy, complications
and patient satisfaction surveys. (√)
▸ All Trusts should have a ‘safe sedation policy’, and ensure all
bronchoscopy unit staff, including trainees, receive appropri￾ate training. (√)
Hypoxaemia
Monitoring patients with pulse oximetry during bronchoscopy is an
accurate non-invasive method for assessing hypoxaemia.9–11
Significant decreases in oxygen saturation are commonly seen
during bronchoscopy, commencing with administration of sedation
and worsening on passage through the vocal cords.8 9 12–16 Patient
positioning8 10 16 and intra-procedural sampling may also influence
oxygen saturations as may airway suctioning.17 18 Van Zwam et al8
described a twofold greater incidence of desaturation >4% and
SpO2<90% in the sitting position compared with supine. The use
of preprocedure oxygen and the specific sampling procedure (BAL
vs wash vs brush vs biopsy) was predictive of a higher rate of desat￾uration episodes (<90%), but baseline saturations were not (desat￾uration to <90% was seen in: BAL 89%, wash 44%, brush 15%,
biopsy 10%).19 Milman et al11 (using benzodiazepine premedica￾tion without oxygen supplementation) demonstrated that 38% of
patients desaturate (SpO2<90%) before bronchoscopy, increasing
to 80% of patients during the procedure. The proportion remains
high after the procedure, with 60% of patients desaturating.
Similarly, more severe desaturation (SpO2<85%) was seen in 10%,
35% and 15%, respectively. No differences in oxygen saturation

were described in a comparison of trans-nasal or trans-oral broncho￾scopic approaches.20
The majority of desaturations are transient and do not require
specific intervention.21 Supplemental oxygen given via nasal or
pharyngeal catheter can reduce the incidence, degree or dur￾ation of desaturation.11 16 22 In patients undergoing BAL and
TBLBs for diffuse ILD, significant hypoxaemia during bronchos￾copy can be avoided with routine supplemental oxygen com￾pared with breathing room air alone, but the proportion of
patients requiring supplemental oxygen in general broncho￾scopic practice is variable, ranging between 5% and 32%, and is
dependent on forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) (or peak
expiratory flow rate (PEFR)).12 21
Patients with abnormal PEFR demonstrate an increased require￾ment for oxygen supplementation (PEFR<60% predicted: 58%,
<45% predicted: 83%)12 and Jones and O’Driscoll21 demonstrated
a greater risk of desaturation to <90% and need for oxygen supple￾mentation with declining FEV1 (table 4).
In studies examining the effect of BAL volume on oxygen sat￾uration, inconsistent results have been reported.15 23
There are no studies that address a safe saturation threshold.
Schiffman et al22 noted that significant desaturation could be
prevented with 4 L/min oxygen supplementation but this did
not impact on the rate of cardiac arrhythmia (sinus tachycardia,
sinus bradycardia, ventricular or atrial premature contractions).
Similarly, Lundgren et al18 did not demonstrate an increase in
cardiac arrhythmia, despite hypoxaemia and increased cardiac
work in 30% of patients. Two further studies demonstrated no
significant increase in the frequency of bradycardia/tachycardia
or premature atrial/ventricular activity with or without oxygen
supplementation.11 20
Hypoxaemia can be effectively minimised by using a nasal or
pharyngeal catheter for oxygen supplementation at either 2 or
3 L/min.11 In hypoxaemic respiratory failure (RR>35, arterial
oxygen pressure (PaO2)/fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2)<200)
non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (FiO2 0.5, adjusted to
maintain SaO2>92%) is superior to a high-flow venturi mask
(constant FiO2 0.9) during bronchoscopy for nosocomial pneu￾monia.24 Several studies, including those post BAL, suggest that
hypoxaemia may persist for at least 2 h after the procedure but
there is no evidence relating to the duration for oxygen supple￾mentation post procedure.25–27
Oxygen supplementation should be used in patients with per￾sistent significant desaturation (SaO2 change > 4% or
SaO2<90%). Target oxygen saturations should be consistent
with the principles of published guidance on oxygen therapy.
Evidence statements
▸ Hypoxaemia is common during bronchoscopy, it is fre￾quently transient, and only considered significant if
prolonged (>1 min). Hypoxaemia is more common in the
sitting position, with oral or intravenous sedation, with
decreasing FEV1 or PEFR, or in patients who require supple￾mental oxygen before the procedure. The use of suction can
exacerbate hypoxaemia. (Evidence level 2++)
▸ Pulse oximetry demonstrates excellent correlation with arter￾ial gas analysis. (Evidence level 3)
▸ The use of supplemental oxygen can reduce the severity of
hypoxaemia, either by nasal or pharyngeal catheter, at flow
rates of at least 2 L/min. (Evidence level 2+).
▸ Oxygen supplementation should be targeted to patients with
persistent significant desaturation (SpO2 change > 4% or
SpO2<90%). Target oxygen saturations should be consistent
with the principles of published guidance on oxygen therapy.
(Evidence level 3)
Recommendations
▸ Patients should be monitored by continuous pulse oximetry
during bronchoscopy. (Grade C)
▸ Oxygen supplementation should be used when desaturation
is significant (SpO2>4% change, or SpO2<90%) and pro￾longed (>1 min) to reduce the risk of hypoxaemia-related
complications. (Grade D)
▸ The risks of hypoxaemia-related complications are associated
with baseline SaO2 and lung function, comorbidity, sedation
and procedural sampling. Fitness for bronchoscopy should
incorporate an assessment of these elements, and appropriate
monitoring and preprocedure optimisation. (Grade D)
Cardiac complications
Hypoxaemia related to FB is commonly associated with an
increase in cardiac workload with elevations of heart rate
(approximately 40% above baseline), blood pressure (a rise of
30% above baseline) and cardiac index (approximately 17–32%
of baseline).14 18 28 29 Despite this, major arrhythmias are rare
during bronchoscopy but believed to be related to myocardial
ischaemia. The rate–pressure product (heart rate×systolic blood
pressure) during bronchoscopy can approach or exceed the level
associated with silent myocardial ischaemia, particularly in
patients with hypertension.14 18 28 Increases in systolic blood
pressure and heart rate during the bronchoscopy are associated
with ECG change in 15% (ST-T change in 4%, transient right
bundle branch block in 3%).29 In addition, ECG changes correl￾ate with older age, higher pack-year smoking history but not
lung function or changes in oxygen saturation. Cardiac strain
has been reported to occur in 21% of patients over the age of
60 years.29
Arrhythmia
Schiffman et al22 demonstrated that bronchoscopy was asso￾ciated with sinus tachycardia in 55–58%, sinus bradycardia in
5–8%, premature ventricular contraction in 8% and atrial pre￾mature contraction in 3–5%, with no significant difference
according to oxygen supplementation. Payne et al20 demon￾strated a 60% prevalence of baseline minor arrhythmia and 5%
incidence of new minor arrhythmia with bronchoscopy.
Katz et al30 documented 12% of patients with at least an
occasional atrial or ventricular ectopic beat before the procedure
compared with 80% of patients during or after bronchoscopy.
Major cardiac arrhythmias (defined as five or more atrial
ectopics/min, supraventricular tachycardia, or five or more ven￾tricular ectopics/min, multiform ectopic beats, couplets or
ventricular tachycardia) increased from 4% before the proced￾ure to 40% during/after the procedure. Atrial arrhythmias occur
at widely differing stages of the procedure, but ventricular

arrhythmias occur mainly on passage through the vocal cords.
Maximum ventricular arrhythmia is correlated with minimum
oxygen saturations. Asymptomatic ST-T wave changes occur in
6% of patients, typically correlating with maximum heart rates.
Oxygen saturations can remain lower than preprocedure levels
3 h after bronchoscopy in 30% of patients.
Myocardial infarction
Acute MI is considered a contraindication to bronchoscopy
within 4–6 weeks. Dweik et al31 retrospectively analysed the
safety of bronchoscopies within 30 days of an acute MI and
noted that mortality (5%) was limited to patients with active
ischaemia at the time of bronchoscopy.
Evidence statements
▸ Bronchoscopy increases cardiac rate, blood pressure and
cardiac index. The rate pressure product is often sufficient to
cause myocardial ischaemia. (Evidence level 2+)
▸ Sinus tachycardia and atrial or ventricular premature contrac￾tions are the commonest arrhythmia noted before, during
and after bronchoscopy. (Evidence level 3)
▸ Ventricular arrhythmia (mostly premature contraction, bi and
trigeminy) occurs most commonly on passage through the
cords and is associated with low oxygen saturations. Oxygen
saturations may remain below preprocedure levels for over
3 h in a third of patients. (Evidence level 3)
▸ Myocardial ischaemia during bronchoscopy is related to
heart rate and blood pressure, rather than oxygen saturation
per se. It also correlates with increasing age and smoking
history. (Evidence level 3)
▸ Bronchoscopy within 30-days of acute MI is associated with
a 5% mortality (related to active ischaemia). In the absence
of active ischaemia, when good clinical justification is made,
bronchoscopy can be performed. (Evidence level 3)
▸ Incidence of cardiac arrhythmia is not affected by oxygen
supplementation. (Evidence level 3)
Recommendations
▸ Continuous ECG monitoring should be used when there is a
high clinical risk of arrhythmia. (Grade D)
▸ When there is a high risk of arrhythmia, oxygen saturations,
pulse rate and blood pressure should be optimised.
Appropriate aftercare monitoring and instructions should be
given. (Grade D)
Good practice points
▸ Resuscitation equipment should be readily available. (√)
▸ Intravenous access should be established before sedation is
given and maintained until discharge. (√)
Bleeding complications
It is difficult to subclassify bleeding during FB into minor, mod￾erate or severe based on an estimate or measures of blood loss
during the procedure. Aspirated blood is collected and mixed
with saline, adrenaline and suctioned secretions and an accurate
measure is not possible. Classification by the type of clinical
intervention necessary to stop the bleeding and stabilise the
patient is an easier and reproducible measure of bleeding (see
table 5, adapted from Ernst et al32).
Minor bleeding occurs in 0.19% and severe bleeding in
0.26% of bronchoscopies.4 Clinical risk factors for bleeding cor￾relate with abnormal coagulation but the rate of biopsy-related
bleeding in patients with clinical risk factors is only 11%
(box 2). In patients with known abnormal coagulation, bleeding
occurred in a similar 11%.33 The type of biopsy, abnormal
coagulation, platelets, haemoglobin or creatinine does not reli￾ably or consistently predict bleeding risk for bronchoscopy.
Over two-thirds of patients who develop bleeding have normal
coagulation and no clinical risk factors for bleeding.
The majority of bleeding is mild to moderate with only 3%
estimated at being more than 100 mL. Approximately 90% of
bleeding stops spontaneously or requires local vasoconstrictor
therapy only (adrenaline/cocaine).33 Appendix 6 provides a
management approach to bleeding complications during FB.
At bronchoscopy, clinically significant bleeding was seen in
0.83%, increasing to 1.9% with biopsy, including TBLB.34
TBLB caused mild–moderate bleeding in 0.8% whereas EBB
bleeding occurs in only 0.45%.34 Severe bleeding is more
common in TBLB than EBB but remains <20 mL in the major￾ity of cases of TBLB (92%).35 Spontaneous resolution of bleed￾ing occurred in two-thirds and was treated with local instillation
of adrenaline in the remainder.35 34 Platelet levels or coagula￾tion studies prior to TBLB do not predict bleeding in proce￾dures in which bleeding occurs.35
Diette et al36 prospectively studied 720 procedures, including
38 lung transplants. Transplant recipients are more likely to have
TBLB and to receive aspirin therapy, to have blood loss >25 mL
and to have the procedure terminated early for bleeding. In multi￾variate analysis, independent predictors of greater blood loss
included lung transplant, performance of TBLB, longer procedure
time and older patient age. A smaller prospective study found that
bleeding was quantitatively similar between patients with and
without lung transplant and typically minor.35
Weiss et al37 prospectively reported 66 bronchoscopies in 47
bone marrow transplant recipients with thrombocytopenia
(20% had platelets <20 000/mL; 67% platelets <50 000/mL;
88% platelets <100 000/mL). Bleeding-related complications
were reported in 6.9% and were usually minor.
In renal failure, including haemodialysis and non-dialysis
patients, bronchoscopic biopsy and transbronchial needle aspir￾ation (TBNA) were associated with an overall complication rate
of 8%.38
The concomitant use of clopidogrel with transbronchial
biopsy leads to excessive (>100 mL) bleeding in patients taking

clopidogrel alone (89% vs 3.4%) and clopidogrel with aspirin
(100% vs 3.4%).32 Bleeding rates are significantly higher in all
categories of bleeding (minor/moderate/severe) but can be con￾trolled in most instances by bronchoscopic means. Need for
transfusion or death following haemorrhage secondary to clopi￾dogrel is rare.32 See appendix 7 for an algorithm for the man￾agement of patients on warfarin or clopidogrel undergoing FB.
Evidence statements
▸ Minor bleeding occurs in 0.19% and severe bleeding in
0.26% of bronchoscopies. (Evidence level 3)
▸ The routine performance of coagulation studies, platelet or
haemoglobin counts are of no value in predicting the risk or
severity of bleeding. (Evidence level 3)
▸ Coagulation studies, platelet count and haemoglobin values
should be estimated when clinical risk factors indicate a like￾lihood of abnormal coagulation. However, over two-thirds
of patients with significant bleeding possess normal coagula￾tion and no clinical risk factors for bleeding. (Evidence
level 3)
▸ Bleeding complications in patients with thrombocytopenia
undergoing bronchoscopy and lavage are approximately
7%. No data are available regarding the safety of TBLB or
EBB in thrombocytopenia but the majority of bleeding
complications relate to epistaxis. (Evidence level 3)
▸ Clopidogrel causes bleeding, ranging from mild to severe,
when performing TBLB. (Evidence level 2+)
▸ TBLB causes a twofold increase in the risk of mild–moderate
bleeding and a threefold increase in the risk of severe bleed￾ing compared with EBB. However, the overall risk remains
small and TBLB rarely causes significant blood loss (92% of
patients experience blood loss <20 mL) and typically
resolves spontaneously or with endoscopic instillation of
cocaine/adrenaline. (Evidence level 3)
▸ Bronchoscopic biopsy and TBNA in patients receiving haemo￾dialysis, or in patients with renal failure without dialysis, result
in a higher rate of bleeding complications (∼8%; 4% major,
4% minor) than the general population. (Evidence level 3)
▸ Lung transplantation may predispose patients to greater
blood loss at bronchoscopic biopsy, including TBLB.
(Evidence level 2−)
Recommendations
▸ Perform coagulation studies, platelet count and haemoglobin
concentration when there are clinical risk factors for abnor￾mal coagulation. (Grade D)
▸ Bronchoscopy with lavage can be performed with platelet
counts >20 000 per μL. Liaise with the local haematology
team regarding the need for platelet transfusion before bron￾choscopy if EBB or TBLB is planned. (Grade D)
▸ Discontinue clopidogrel 7 days prior to consideration of EBB
and TBLB. Low-dose aspirin alone can be continued.
(Grade C)
Good practice points
▸ Anticoagulants should be managed according to published
guidelines as set out in appendix 7 of this guideline. (√)
▸ The risk of biopsy needs to be weighed against the potential
for benefit and appropriate informed consent obtained. (√)
Pneumothorax
Pneumothorax following bronchoscopy for any indication
occurs at a rate of 1 in 1000 (0.1–0.16%)4 39 but was as high as
0.4–0.8% in some smaller series.40 41 In contrast the rate of
pneumothorax in TBLB has been reported to be significantly
higher between 1% and 6%4 39 42 43 or higher still in TBLB of
diffuse abnormality (9%).43–46 TBLB remains a safe outpatient
procedure with a low incidence of delayed complications.47
In relation to all adverse events, pneumothorax represents
approximately 10% of all complications but rarely complicates
bronchoscopy without TBLB or therapeutic bronchoscopy.4
Pneumothorax is rarely total and often delayed (∼40% of pneu￾mothoraces)4 and when present may require intercostal tube
drainage (40–70% of cases).39 42 43 47 The frequency of
pneumothorax is related to age and the number of TBLBs.5 44
Routine performance of a chest x-ray after TBLB rarely provides
useful clinical information in the absence of symptoms43 44 48
and may not be required. In the absence of a routine chest x-ray,
monitoring for the development of symptoms associated with
pneumothorax should continue for 2 h. The rate of pneumo￾thorax following TBLB does not appear significantly different
with or without fluoroscopy,45 but fluoroscopy may be of value
to improve the diagnostic yield in focal rather than diffuse lung
disease (focal 4.3%, diffuse 9%).43
Evidence statements
▸ Risk of pneumothorax from all bronchoscopic procedures is
1 in 1000 (0.1%) but increases to between 1 in 100 to 1 in
16 (1–6%) following TBLB. (Evidence level 3)
▸ Pneumothorax may be delayed (up to 2 h in 40% of cases)
and may require intercostal tube drainage (Evidence level 3)
▸ Routine performance of a chest x-ray after TBLB rarely pro￾vides useful clinical information in the absence of symptoms.
(Evidence level 3)
▸ Fluoroscopy may reduce the rate of pneumothorax in focal
lung disease. (Evidence level 3)
Recommendations
▸ A chest radiograph should be obtained if a patient is symp￾tomatic or there is a clinical suspicion of possible pneumo￾thorax after TBLB. (Grade D)
▸ Fluoroscopic screening may improve diagnostic yield of
TBLB in focal but not diffuse lung disease. (Grade D)
▸ Patients should be advised of the potential for delayed compli￾cations following TBLB and provided with written information
regarding likely symptoms and action required. (Grade D)
Fever and infection
Post bronchoscopy fever (PBF) is not reported in a large pro￾spective study of complications in over 20 000 patients4 but
appears relatively common in other smaller prospective studies
focusing on PBF (5–10%).49 50 PBF is most typically seen
approximately 8 h (range 4–24 h) following BAL (13%) when it
is associated with an acute inflammatory response characterised
by fever >38°C, neutrophilic leucocytosis, elevated C-reactive
protein, fibrinogen and proinflammatory cytokines,50–52 and an
absence of bacteraemia.49 50 53 Fever is typically less than 40°C,
lasts on average 14 h but is rarely accompanied by a chest x-ray
infiltrate.50 Antibiotic prophylaxis does not prevent PBF, pneu￾monia or the proinflammatory cytokine response.53 54
A true bacteraemia post bronchoscopy occurs in 6–8% of
patients,49 55 most commonly coagulase negative or positive
staphylococci, non-haemolytic or β-haemolytic streptococci,
Citrobacter or Klebsiella species.49 54 55 National Institute for
Health and Clinical Excellence guidance in March 2008 also con￾cluded that ‘Antibacterial prophylaxis is not recommended for the
prevention of endocarditis in patients undergoing procedures of
the upper and lower respiratory tract (including bronchoscopy)’.
56
Evidence statements
▸ PBF is common, particularly after BAL, and associated with a
non-infective acute inflammatory response, typically starting
after discharge from hospital. (Evidence level 2++)

SAFETY OF FB IN SPECIFIC MEDICAL CONDITIONS
Patients with asthma
The safety of bronchoscopy in asthma has been studied in
research and clinical settings. Bronchoscopy often causes a fall
in FEV1. In healthy volunteers the mean fall in FEV1 has been
reported on average to be between 9% and 17%,15 57 however
it can be over 20%.58 In patients with asthma the mean fall has
been reported to be 10–26%.15 57 59 The majority of studies
comparing the fall in FEV1 between patients with asthma and
healthy volunteers found no difference between the
groups.15 58 60 Patients with increased bronchial hyper-reactivity
may have a greater fall in FEV1
57 61 however this has not been
universally reported.58 In particular, BAL can cause a fall in the
FEV1.
58 59
Complication rates post bronchoscopy range between 3.5%
and 12% depending on how the complications are reported and
what procedures were performed.15 60–63 In addition, patients
with severe asthma are more likely to require oral corticoster￾oids post bronchoscopy.58 Many of the studies use bronchodila￾tors prior to bronchoscopy to increase the FEV1.
57 58 60 62
Although this does not seem to reduce the percentage fall in
FEV1 it may increase the absolute FEV1 at the end of the pro￾cedure, as the patient starts from a higher baseline.
Evidence statements
▸ Up to 10% of patients with asthma may develop respiratory
symptoms post bronchoscopy. (Evidence level 2−)
▸ BAL is associated with more symptoms in patients with asthma
compared with bronchoscopy alone. (Evidence level 2−)
Recommendation
▸ Patients’ asthma control should be optimised prior to bron￾choscopy, especially when BAL is likely to be performed.
(Grade C)
Good practice point
▸ Nebulised bronchodilators should be considered before bron￾choscopy in patients with asthma. (√)
Patients with COPD
Bronchoscopy in patients with COPD appears to carry a greater
risk compared with those with normal lung function. An
increased risk of complications has been reported in severe
COPD (defined as FEV1<50% predicted or FEV1<1 L and
with FEV1/forced vital capacity < 69%).64 Five percent of
patients with COPD compared with 0.6% of controls experi￾enced complication: pneumonia, respiratory failure and desatur￾ation.64 In a separate study, bronchoscopy safety was studied in
patients with hypercapnia, 77% of whom had COPD.65
Desaturation occurred in 30% of the study population, 55% of
patients developed wheezing and the procedure was terminated
early in 20% of patients.65 A randomised control trial studied
the effect of inhaled salbutamol (200 mg) on FEV1 after bron￾choscopy in moderate to severe COPD.66 No difference was
observed (change in FEV1) in the group receiving salbutamol
compared with placebo. Nine percent of patients experienced
desaturation during bronchoscopy, with no difference again
being observed between treatment groups.
In research bronchoscopy comparable complication rates have
been reported. Hattotuwa et al67 reported a complication rate
of 9%, including haemoptysis (5%), pneumothorax (2%) and
bronchospasm (2%). All patients were given 2.5 mg nebulised
salbutamol prior to the procedure.
Evidence statements
▸ Patients with COPD have a higher risk of desaturation and
bronchoconstriction compared with controls, however this is
not a universal finding. (Evidence level 2−)
▸ Nebulised salbutamol administered prior to bronchoscopy
does not alter the post-bronchoscopy complication rate in
patients with COPD. (Evidence level 1−)
Recommendations
▸ COPD treatment should be optimised prior to bronchoscopy
when possible. (Grade D)
▸ Bronchoscopists should be cautious when sedating patients
with COPD. (Grade D)
Patients with ischaemic heart disease
The haemodynamic changes during FB might increase the risk
of myocardial damage during the procedure. One study has
shown an increased risk of ischaemic ECG changes during the
procedure in patients over 60.29 A retrospective study investi￾gated the safety of bronchoscopy in 20 patients after acute MI.
The procedure was performed an average of 12 days after MI.31
One death occurred in this study—a patient with acute myocar￾dial ischaemia before and during the procedure. No other com￾plications were reported. A retrospective study of patients
undergoing bronchoscopy on a coronary care unit reported no
difference in complications in subjects after MI compared with
those without MI.68
The American perioperative guidelines recommend that elect￾ive surgery is avoided for 4–6 weeks after an acute event result￾ing in myocardial damage.69
Evidence statements
▸ Active myocardial ischaemia is a contraindication to bron￾choscopy. (Evidence level 3)
▸ FB can increase the risk of active ischaemia, haemodynamic
compromise, arrhythmia and further ischaemic events after
MI. (Evidence level 3)
Recommendations
▸ Liaison with cardiologists should be considered in high-risk
patients with cardiac disease and if FB is indicated within 4–
6 weeks after MI. (Grade D)
▸ FB should ideally be delayed for 4 weeks after MI.
(Grade D)
Bronchoscopy for haemoptysis
Bronchoscopy can be used to investigate haemoptysis. CT scans
have changed the diagnostic pathway and should always be con￾sidered prior to bronchoscopy. Two studies have investigated the
role of bronchoscopy following a thoracic CT scan. One study
in Turkey found a bleeding site in 80% of 203 individuals even
if the CT and chest x-ray were normal.70 A different study
(n=200) found an endobronchial diagnosis in 0.5% of indivi￾duals when the CTwas normal.71
Recommendation
▸ Consider bronchoscopy after a normal CT if the patient is
high risk for lung carcinoma or if the haemoptysis continues.

Bronchoscopy in the older patient
Comorbid disease is more likely in the older patient with a
potential increase in bronchoscopy risk. Several studies have
shown older patients tolerate the procedure well, with no
increase in complications.72–74 A prospective cohort study5 sug￾gested that complication rates for pneumothorax and transient
hypotension increased with age. When the safety of bronchos￾copy was investigated in patients over 80 years old, higher com￾plication rates and mortality rates were reported and these
patients were also more likely to be mechanically ventilated
after bronchoscopy.75
Recommendations
▸ Age alone should not be a contraindication for bronchos￾copy. (Grade D)
▸ The older patient may require reduced doses of benzodiaze￾pines/opioids for sedation. (Grade D)
Bronchoscopy in patients who are immunosuppressed
FB can provide useful diagnostic information when treating
patients with respiratory problems who are immunosuppressed
(see ‘Diagnosis of infection’ in this guideline for details of diagnos￾tic value). Bronchoscopy and associated diagnostic techniques are
not without risk in this patient population and this should be
taken into account before performing a bronchoscopy. BAL has a
reported complication rate of 0–49%, depending on how the com￾plications were defined, and deaths associated with BAL have been
reported.76–82 The main complications associated with BAL are
desaturation, a drop in FEV1 and haemorrhage.
Protected specimen brushes (PSBs) can sometimes be used for
similar indications to BAL. One study involved patients who
were immunocompromised following bone marrow transplant78
and showed that the complication rates for PSBs were signifi￾cantly higher than for BAL (36% vs 14%).
TBLB can carry a significant higher complication risk (30%)
compared with BAL alone.79 81 Pneumothorax, haemorrhage
and desaturation were reported to be complications associated
with TBLB.79 81
Three studies comparing the overall mortality in patients
investigated with FB and patients investigated with non-invasive
techniques for obtaining diagnostic samples failed to demon￾strate that obtaining samples by bronchoscopy significantly
reduces mortality.77 78 One study suggested that early FB to
obtain diagnostic samples is associated with a lower mortality
compared with delayed bronchoscopy for the same indication.82
In patients who have had lung transplantation, TBLB may be
the only means of diagnosing allograft rejection. It has previ￾ously been reported that lung transplant patients have a higher
risk of bleeding (>25 mL blood) (44%) compared to other
patients undergoing bronchoscopy, resulting in 5.4% of proce￾dures being terminated early.36 Larger studies have suggested
that significant bleeding occurs in 25%83 or 13% of patients84
depending on how bleeding is diagnosed. The largest study85
suggested that bronchoscopy in lung transplant patients carried
no increased risk compared with other patient groups and
reported a complication risk of 0.7%. It should be noted that
only 57% of procedures in this study included TBLB.85 Other
groups have reported higher complication rates of between
4.8% and 22%.83 84 86 The main complications associated with
TBLB are oversedation, pneumothorax and haemorrhage.
Evidence statements
▸ PSB has a low diagnostic yield, is rarely positive when BAL is
negative and has a higher complication rate than BAL.
(Evidence level 2+)
▸ BAL in patients who are immunocompromised has a diag￾nostic rate of 45–62% for infection with an associated com￾plication rate of 0–49%. (Evidence level 2++)
▸ TBLB carries an increased complication rate compared with
BAL of around 30%, which is mainly explained by the
increased risk of pneumothorax. (Evidence level 2++)
▸ Lung transplant patients may be at higher risk of bleeding than
other patients who are immunosuppressed. (Evidence level 2−)
▸ TBLB has a reported complication rate of between 0.7% and
22%, with the main complications being oversedation,
pneumothorax and haemorrhage. (Evidence level 2++)
Recommendations
▸ When a diagnosis is not likely to be obtained through non￾invasive measures, bronchoscopy with BAL can be consid￾ered to provide diagnostic information. (Grade C)
▸ TBLB is helpful in lung transplant recipients when rejection
is a possibility. (Grade C)
PREMEDICATION, SEDATION AND TOPICAL ANAESTHESIA
FOR FB
Premedication
Various drugs have been considered to have a potential role as
premedication, including anticholinergics (atropine and glyco￾pyrrolate), other drugs with cardiovascular activity (eg, cloni￾dine and labetalol), fenoterol, benzodiazepines and opioids.
Anticholinergics
Anticholinergics, such as atropine and glycopyrrolate, have been
postulated to reduce cough and improve bronchoscopic views
by reducing airway secretions, and also to prevent vasovagal
reactions and reduce reflex bronchoconstriction. Three rando￾mised controlled trials (cumulatively studying more than 1300
patients) examined anticholinergics and failed to demonstrate
any consistent clinical benefit for patients undergoing bronchos￾copy.87–89 Anticholinergics were associated with an increase in
haemodynamic fluctuations (tachycardia and hypertension).
Drugs with cardiovascular activity
Hypertension and tachycardia can commonly occur during
bronchoscopy. Several drugs that may blunt the cardiovascular
response to bronchoscopy have been studied, postulating a role
in avoidance of myocardial ischaemia and arrhythmias.
Two small randomised controlled trials examined the role of
clonidine, a centrally acting antihypertensive, and demonstrated
a blunting of cardiovascular responses (including blood pressure,
heart rate and noradrenaline surges), although hypotension
requiring treatment was seen at higher doses of clonidine and
there was no improvement in patient tolerance.90 91
A randomised study of intravenous labetalol failed to demon￾strate any changes in haemodynamic parameters or procedural tol￾erance associated with labetalol administration.92 Surprisingly,
there was no tachycardia or hypertension seen in patients in the
control arm (who received relatively high doses of sedation), sug￾gesting that the sedation regime is a significant determinant of
haemodynamic responses.
Further studies are required to define potential patient benefit
of cardiovascular-related premedication and should be powered
for endpoints such as myocardial ischaemia and arrhythmias.
Premedication with other drugs
Other small randomised controlled trials have indicated a
benefit for several premedication drugs, but study limitations
(size, design and lack of detailed participant characteristics)
mean that further investigation is required: fenoterol may

reduce cough rate and topical anaesthesia requirements93; dex￾tromethorphan may lower sedation and topical anaesthesia
requirements while improving patient tolerance94; low-dose oral
lorazepam is associated with more favourable bronchoscopy
recall at 24 h, but not immediately after the procedure.95
The use of premedication with benzodiazepines (such as lor￾azepam) and opioid-like drugs (such as dextromethorphan)
should be discouraged if the same class of drug is to be adminis￾tered intravenously during bronchoscopy.
Evidence statements
▸ Three randomised controlled trials have failed to demon￾strate significant clinical benefits associated with anticholiner￾gics. Their use in bronchoscopy may be associated with an
increased rate of cardiovascular adverse effects. (Evidence
level 1+)
▸ There is a lack of evidence suggesting benefit of routine pre￾medication for bronchoscopy. Small randomised studies
suggest a potential role for several agents (clonidine, dextro￾methorphan, fenoterol, lorazepam), but such findings require
validation in much larger studies of well characterised
patients. (Evidence level 1−)
Recommendations
▸ Anticholinergics (glycopyrrolate or atropine) should not rou￾tinely be used prior to bronchoscopy due to a lack of clinical
benefit and a possible increased risk of haemodynamic
changes. (Grade A)
▸ Premedication for bronchoscopy is not routinely indicated.
(Grade C)
Sedation
The majority of bronchoscopists in the UK use sedation for
bronchoscopy, with only 5–10% routinely performing bron￾choscopy on unsedated patients.96 97 Five randomised con￾trolled trials,95 98–101 one cohort study102 and one qualitative
study103 examined patient and physician preference for sedation
during bronchoscopy. These studies provided a broad consensus
that patients and physicians usually preferred sedation for bron￾choscopy, examining domains such as comfort, tolerance,
bronchoscopic ease and willingness to undergo a repeat proced￾ure. Some studies96 100 104 suggested that a subset of patients
tolerate unsedated bronchoscopy well, suggesting that sedation
should remain an option dependent on patient preference and
comorbidities (which may limit suitability for sedation).
Evidence statements
▸ Patients and physicians usually prefer the use of sedation for
bronchoscopy. (Evidence level 1+)
Recommendations
▸ Intravenous sedation should be offered to patients undergo￾ing bronchoscopy, provided there are no contraindications.
(Grade B)
▸ Some patients will tolerate unsedated bronchoscopy well,
and patient preference should be sought. (Grade B)
Administration of sedation
Sedation for bronchoscopy is usually the responsibility of
bronchoscopists, although some centres use anaesthetist￾delivered sedation. Bronchoscopist-delivered sedation should be
carefully titrated using small incremental doses to avoid overse￾dation, particularly given significant variability of patient
response to sedatives. The practice of non-titrated single large
bolus dose sedation regimes is strongly discouraged.105
The desired depth of sedation is usually ‘conscious’ sedation,
in which the patient maintains airway patency and cardiorespira￾tory function and verbal contact with the patient is possible at
all times,106 although interventional bronchoscopy may occa￾sionally require deeper sedation provided by formal anaesthetic
support. Patients who are more deeply sedated should have the
same level of care and monitoring as those undergoing a formal
general anaesthetic. An Intercollegiate Working Party of the UK
Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, chaired by the Royal
College of Anaesthetists, has produced a summary of safe sed￾ation practice (table 6).
Assessment and quantification of sedation depth may be aided
by various tools, including the Ramsay Scale107 and the
Modified Observer’s Assessment of Alertness/Sedation score108
(see appendix 9). These tools have particular utility in documen￾tation of sedation level as part of the bronchoscopy record.
Evidence statement
▸ There is a significant and unpredictable inter-patient variabil￾ity in required doses of sedative drugs. (Evidence level 1+)
Recommendations
▸ Sedative drugs should be titrated to provide the desired
depth of sedation, given significant inter-patient variability in
required doses. (Grade B)
▸ The desired depth of sedation is one in which verbal contact
is possible at all times. (Grade D)
Good practice point
▸ Bronchoscopists are encouraged to document an assessment
of sedation depth as part of the procedural report. (√)
Drugs used as sedatives for bronchoscopy
Please refer to appendix 8, tables 1 and 2.
A 2003 UK survey found that 78% of bronchoscopists rou￾tinely use midazolam sedation, with midazolam and fentanyl/
alfentanil being the most frequent combination sedation regime
used.96 Eleven randomised controlled trials101 108–118 have
investigated various drugs and drug combinations for bronchos￾copy sedation, including benzodiazepines (eg, midazolam), pro￾pofol (and its novel pro-drug fospropofol), ketamine and
opioids (eg, fentanyl, alfentanil).
Benzodiazepines and propofol
Benzodiazepines (eg, midazolam) cause sedation, anxiolysis and
anterograde amnesia by binding to and increasing the activity of

γ–aminobutyric acid (GABA), a major brain neuroinhibitory
transmitter. Other benzodiazepines (eg, diazepam and loraze￾pam) have been used for bronchoscopy, but midazolam has par￾ticular suitability given a rapid peak effect and a relatively short
half life. Natural variability in the action of cytochrome P450
(CYP) 3A4 and 3A5, responsible for benzodiazepine metabol￾ism, may prolong elimination half life by up to sixfold in 5–8%
of the population.119
Flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist, can effectively
reverse benzodiazepine oversedation and must be immediately
available, although its administration should not be part of
routine sedation practice.105 Given that flumazenil has a shorter
half life than midazolam, physicians should be aware of the risks
of re-sedation and respiratory depression when flumazenil’s
effects cease.
A 2008 National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) report high￾lighted cases of harm and death resulting from administration of
excessive doses of midazolam.105 To prevent inadvertent injec￾tion of high-strength midazolam solution (2 or 5 mg/mL), the
NPSA mandates that only low-strength midazolam solution
(1 mg/mL) should be available in clinical areas, unless a formal
risk assessment has been undertaken.
Propofol (and its pro-drug fospropofol) is another sedative
hypnotic that exerts its actions, in part, by increasing the activity
of GABA. Together with ketamine, these drugs have a relatively
narrow therapeutic window between ‘conscious’ sedation and
general anaesthesia, and are currently recommended for use
solely by anaesthetists in the UK106
Midazolam and propofol have been shown in randomised and
cohort studies to improve the experience of having a FB,98–100
reduce procedural discomfort,98 99 102 cause anterograde
amnesia,95 99 increase willingness of patients to have further pro￾cedures,95 99 without worsening the adverse event profile.
Studies comparing propofol with midazolam (±opioid)
have found that propofol is associated with a shorter recov￾ery time than midazolam (although the effect size is relatively
small) and both regimes are associated with similar adverse
event profiles.109–111 115 118 Most studies suggest that patient
tolerance is broadly similar for midazolam and propofol,
although two studies favoured propofol—Clark et al110
found a similar assessment of tolerance and cough by the
bronchoscopist, but patient assessment favoured propofol.
Lo et al115 compared bispectral index guided propofol sed￾ation with clinically guided midazolam sedation (both with
alfentanil) and found patient and physician assessment to be
improved for propofol (although this group was associated
with a lower mean blood pressure, of uncertain significance).
Further work has compared combined propofol/alfentanil
and propofol/ketamine sedation, finding high satisfaction
scores for both, although worryingly, both regimes were
reported as frequently being associated with oxygen satura￾tions <90% despite supplemental oxygen.114
Opioids
The mechanism of action of opioids such as fentanyl and alfen￾tanil is not completely understood, but they are known to be
μ-opioid receptor agonists, causing analgesia, sedation and sup￾pression of the cough reflex. Fentanyl and alfentanil have
favourable pharmacological profiles for bronchoscopy, having a
rapid peak effect and a relatively short half life. The competi￾tive antagonist, naloxone, effectively reverses opioid-induced
respiratory depression and oversedation. For oversedated
patients who have received benzodiazepine and opioid, initial
reversal with flumazenil (rather than naloxone) is recom￾mended, unless the patient has received a particularly high
dose of opioid.
Data supporting the use of monoagent sedation with opioids
are limited. One small randomised study compared midazolam
with alfentanil sedation, reporting a small improvement in
physician-assessed cough score associated with alfentanil, with
similar patient and physician assessment of discomfort and phys￾ician assessment of procedural ease.113
Addition of an opioid to midazolam or propofol improves
procedural cough, reduces lidocaine usage and increases patient
procedural tolerance.117 118 120 The risk of oversedation may
increase when using combination agents, although several
studies have failed to demonstrate any increase in clinically sig￾nificant adverse events.117 118 120 Opioids should be adminis￾tered (and allowed to reach maximal effect) prior to
administration of any other agent.106
Evidence statements
▸ Midazolam and propofol are sedative agents that can improve
bronchoscopy tolerance, decrease discomfort, improve
bronchoscopic conditions and increase willingness of patients
to have further bronchoscopies. (Evidence level 1+)
▸ Propofol is associated with a shorter recovery time and a
similar adverse event profile as midazolam, although it has
been evaluated in the context of medical professionals who
are expert in its use. Propofol has a variable and narrow
therapeutic window and higher doses cause general anaesthe￾sia. There is no reversal agent or antagonist available for pro￾pofol. (Evidence level 1+)
▸ Addition of an opioid to midazolam or propofol is associated
with an improvement in cough, reduced lidocaine usage
and increased patient tolerance to bronchoscopy. (Evidence
level 1+)
Recommendations
▸ Benzodiazepines
▸ Intravenous midazolam is the preferred drug for sedation,
having a rapid onset of action, being titratable to provide
the required depth of sedation and being reversible.
(Grade B)
▸ No more than 5 mg midazolam should be initially drawn up
into any syringe prior to bronchoscopy for patients under
the age of 70 (2 mg midazolam for patients over 70) to
prevent potential inadvertent oversedation associated with
the practice of routinely drawing up 10 mg midazolam.
(Grade D)
▸ Only low-strength midazolam (1 mg/mL) should be available
within bronchoscopy suites. High-strength midazolam (2 mg/
mL or 5 mg/mL) should be restricted to general anaesthesia,
intensive care and other areas where its use has been for￾mally risk assessed. (Grade D)
▸ Propofol
▸ While propofol has similar efficacy to midazolam, it should
only be used when administered by practitioners formally
trained in its administration (eg, anaesthetists) since it has a
narrow therapeutic window beyond which general anaesthe￾sia is achieved. (Grade B)
▸ Opioids
▸ Combination opioid and midazolam sedation should be con￾sidered in patients to improve bronchoscopic tolerance.
(Grade B)
▸ When opioids are used, short-acting agents (such as fentanyl
or alfentanil) should be used to minimise post-procedural
sedation. (Grade D)

Sedation in specific patient groups
Please refer to appendix 8, tables 1 and 2.
Respiratory failure
Risk of oversedation and respiratory depression may be
increased when using combined sedation for patients in respira￾tory failure, although one cohort study failed to demonstrate
this. Dreher et al120 compared midazolam with combined mida￾zolam/alfentanil sedation in 30 patients with type I or II respira￾tory failure. A small, but similar increase in partial pressure
of CO2 was seen in both groups, and combined therapy was
associated with improved patient and physician satisfaction.
Nevertheless, caution is recommended when administering sed￾ation to patients in respiratory failure.
Older patients
Older patients are likely to require lower doses of sedatives for
bronchoscopy and may have prolonged after effects. A study of
flunitrazepam (a benzodiazepine) found that, for the same dose
of sedative, patients over 60 years old had a prolonged period
of amnesia, with a extended duration of impaired coordination
(which should be considered when patients are being dis￾charged)121 After reports of harm secondary to oversedation in
older patients undergoing therapeutic gastrointestinal endos￾copy, a 2004 National Confidential Enquiry into Patient
Outcome and Death recommended that the practice of routinely
drawing up 10 mg midazolam should stop and no more than
2 mg should be initially drawn up for patients over 70 years old
(5 mg for patients under 70 years old).122 123
Comorbidities
Other conditions that are likely to require dose modification
include hepatic impairment, heart failure and renal impairment.
Concomitant medications
Benzodiazepines, fentanyl and alfentanil are metabolised by
CYP 3A4 and there is a risk of prolonged sedation in those
receiving concomitant medications that inhibit these enzymes,
such as antifungals, antiretrovirals, calcium channel blockers and
macrolide antibiotics.
Substance misusers
A cohort study found that substance misusers are likely to need
higher doses of sedatives during bronchoscopy.124
Topical anaesthesia
Methods for providing airway topical anaesthesia
Lidocaine is the most commonly used drug for topical anaesthe￾sia of the upper airways and tracheobronchial tree, and a variety
of preparations and modes of application are used. Lidocaine
stabilises the neuronal membrane by inhibiting ionic fluxes,
thereby preventing the initiation and conduction of action
potentials. Topical anaesthesia has been achieved using 2% gel
(nasal), 10% spray (nasal and oropharyngeal) and 1–4% solu￾tion (‘spray-as-you-go’ via the bronchoscope working channel;
injection into the trachea through the cricothryoid membrane;
nebulised; using a dropper in the oropharynx; and applied to
the nasal passages using soaked pledgets).
Lidocaine administered to the larynx and tracheobronchial
tree significantly reduces incidence of cough and stridor, and
reduces the requirement for sedative drugs.125 Other drugs,
such as benzocaine and tetracaine, have been used, but lidocaine
is the best characterised with a low risk of adverse effects
(including methaemoglobinaemia)126 Cocaine has previously
been used for nasal anaesthesia, but is no longer routinely avail￾able in the UK and can be associated with myocardial ischaemia
and infarction.127 128
Nasal topical anaesthesia
Nasal lidocaine is most effectively provided using lidocaine gel.
In the UK, 2% lidocaine gel preparations are available in
volumes of 6 mL, although smaller volumes may be sufficient.
Several studies have demonstrated that patients prefer 2% lido￾caine gel to lidocaine spray, lidocaine-soaked swabs or EMLA
cream.129–131
Oropharyngeal topical anaesthesia
Oropharyngeal topical anaesthesia is conventionally provided
using 10% lidocaine spray (10 mg per actuation, usually two to
five actuations), although nebulised lidocaine has also been
used. One small randomised study132 found similar efficacy in
cough suppression of 10% lidocaine spray and nebulised 4%
lidocaine, although the groups were not well matched (particu￾larly smoking status) and subsequent studies have suggested a
lack of efficacy of nebulised lidocaine (see below).
Laryngeal and tracheobronchial topical anaesthesia
Several techniques may be used to administer lidocaine to the
larynx and lower airways, including:
▸ ‘Spray-as-you-go’ delivery, in which lidocaine is applied via
the bronchoscope working channel. Repeated application
allows lidocaine delivery to the entire airway.
▸ Direct injection into the upper trachea using a needle passed
through the cricothyroid membrane, allowing lidocaine
delivery to the larynx and trachea prior to bronchoscope
insertion. Further lidocaine doses to the bronchial tree may
be administered as required via the bronchoscope.
Spray-as-you-go and cricothyroid lidocaine have had limited
comparative evaluation. One small randomised study found a
decreased cough rate, but similar patient experience, associated
with cricothyroid administration (vs spray-as-you-go).133 A
further small randomised study found bronchoscopic condi￾tions, but not patient assessment, were improved for cricothyr￾oid administration compared with nebulised lidocaine.134
The evidence for use of nebulised lidocaine is conflicting. The
largest randomised controlled trial 135 (150 patients) of nebu￾lised 4% lidocaine versus saline placebo found no benefit to
nebulised lidocaine (comparing additional doses of lidocaine
required, and cough and comfort scores), while doubling the
total dose of lidocaine administered in those who received nebu￾lised treatment. All patients also received lidocaine spray to the
nasopharynx and oropharynx, a small volume of lidocaine solu￾tion to the vocal cords and main bronchi, and sedation.
The optimal concentration of lidocaine solution has been
investigated in three studies, which demonstrated that volume,
rather than concentration, of lidocaine determined efficacy of
airway topical anaesthesia. A randomised spray-as-you-go study,
comparing the same volume of 1% and 2% lidocaine (delivered
to the larynx and tracheobronchial tree), found no difference in
subjective and objective measures of cough suppression.136
Another randomised study compared similar volumes of 1%,
1.5% and 2% lidocaine trickled onto the back of the patient’s
tongue, which was allowed to be aspirated into the larynx.137
Although a relatively small study, 1% was found to be equally

efficacious at cough suppression and had similar requirements
for additional lidocaine during bronchoscopy. In a randomised
awake fibre-optic intubation study,138 lidocaine was delivered
using spray-as-you-go to the hypopharynx and larynx until
adequate topical anaesthesia for intubation was produced. The
same volume of 2% lidocaine solution was found to be as effect￾ive as 4% (1% lidocaine solution was not evaluated).
Evidence statements
▸ Topical anaesthesia with lidocaine reduces cough and
decreases sedation requirements. (Evidence level 1−)
▸ While other topical anaesthetics such as benzocaine, tetra￾caine and cocaine have been studied, lidocaine is the best
characterised and has a lower risk of methaemoglobinaemia.
(Evidence level 3)
▸ Good quality randomised studies suggest lower concentration
lidocaine is as effective as higher concentrations in achieving
cough amelioration during bronchoscopy. (Evidence level 1+)
Recommendations
▸ Lidocaine should be used for topical anaesthesia during
bronchoscopy, unless contraindicated. (Grade A)
▸ Nasal topical anaesthesia is most effectively provided using
2% lidocaine gel. (Grade A)
▸ Both cricothyroid and spray-as-you-go techniques are effect￾ive in delivering lidocaine to the vocal cords and trachea.
(Grade B)
▸ Nebulisation is not recommended as a technique for deliver￾ing lidocaine to the airways. (Grade B)
▸ 1% lidocaine solution should be used for spray-as-you-go
administration. (Grade A)
The maximal safe dose of lidocaine
Lidocaine has a favourable safety profile when used for bron￾choscopy, although high topical doses may cause high
serum concentrations, associated with subjective and life￾threatening objective signs of toxicity (particularly affecting
the central nervous and cardiovascular systems—see appendix 8,
table 1).
Peak serum concentrations usually occur from 20 to 45 min
after topical application,137–139 although concentrations of
active (but less potent) metabolites (eg, monoethylglycinexyli￾dide) continue to rise for at least 2 h.140 Several studies have
examined the maximal safe dose of lidocaine, with conflicting
results. Lidocaine toxicity is conventionally accepted to be likely
above serum concentrations of 5 mg/mL, although studies
suggest that subjective side effects may occur at much lower
serum concentrations;
Frey et al141 studied 154 patients who received a mean dose
of 15.4 mg/kg lidocaine (including nebulised lidocaine and nasal
gel lidocaine). A total of 62% of patients had euphoria or dizzi￾ness (subjective signs of toxicity) despite only one patient having
serum concentration >5 mg/mL.
Martin et al142 studied 39 volunteer healthcare workers
having unsedated bronchoscopy who received a median dose of
9.6 mg/kg lidocaine (including nebulised and nasal gel lido￾caine). A total of 92% had subjective side effects.
Other studies failed to demonstrate side effects with average
lidocaine doses of 7.1–9.3 mg/kg.137 139 140 142 However, these
data should be interpreted with caution given significant inter￾patient variability between dose administered and serum con￾centration (partly due to unpredictable absorption at different
parts of the respiratory tract), with serum concentrations
>5 mg/mL occasionally seen even for lower doses of adminis￾tered lidocaine.137 140 142 143 Given randomised studies suggest￾ing that a low cough score is achievable with a total lidocaine
dose of less than 160 mg,118 135 bronchoscopists should strive
to use the lowest dose of lidocaine possible, while still ensuring
good bronchoscopic conditions and patient comfort.
While lidocaine absorption varies throughout the respiratory
tract, bronchoscopists should assess and record the total lidocaine
dose administered during bronchoscopy (including nasal, oropha￾ryngeal, laryngeal and tracheobronchial lidocaine). Appendix 8,
table 3 illustrates the lidocaine dose associated with various formula￾tions and concentrations.
Factor influencing the risk of lidocaine toxicity during
bronchoscopy
Please refer to appendix 8.
Risk of toxicity increases in those with hepatic and cardiac
dysfunction, and significant renal impairment. Care should be
taken with older patients, although one small study found no
difference in adverse events associated with bronchoscopic lido￾caine administration (mean dose 10.6 mg/kg) when comparing
patients aged 30–50 years with those aged 60–75 years.144
Evidence statements
▸ For the same dose of administered lidocaine, there is signifi￾cant inter-patient variability in the corresponding peak serum
lidocaine concentration. (Evidence level 1+)
▸ Doses up to 15.4 mg/kg may be used without serious adverse
events, but subjective symptoms of lidocaine toxicity (eg, diz￾ziness, euphoria) were reported in studies using ≥9.6 mg/kg
lidocaine. (Evidence level 2+)
▸ Low total doses of lidocaine <160 mg may be associated
with effective cough suppression. (Evidence level 1+)
Recommendations
▸ To reduce the risk of lidocaine toxicity, bronchoscopists
should use the lowest dose of lidocaine sufficient to prevent
excessive coughing and provide patient comfort. (Grade D)
▸ Bronchoscopists should remain vigilant for objective and sub￾jective symptoms of lidocaine toxicity, particularly given sig￾nificant inter-patient variability in lidocaine absorption and
metabolism. (Grade B)
Good practice point
▸ Bronchoscopists should monitor and document the total
lidocaine dose delivered at all sites during bronchoscopy. (√)
SAMPLING AND DIAGNOSTIC ACCURACY
Bronchoscopy is an important tool in the diagnostic pathway
for patients with potential lung cancer, with interstitial lung
disease and with pulmonary infection. A variety of sampling
methods can be used during FB. A how to guide on sampling
techniques can be found in appendix 10.
Lung cancer
In patients with lung cancer, a chest CT scan should be
performed prior to a bronchoscopy and patients with central
lesions on the CT scan should be offered bronchoscopy if the
nodal status does not influence the management decision. The
diagnostic yield from bronchoscopy depends on whether
the tumour is visible within the bronchial tree. Many studies
have demonstrated the sensitivity of bronchial biopsy with
forceps, which ranges from 48% to 93% (American College of
Chest Physicians guidelines 2007, table 2).145
Studies have shown that the addition of bronchial brush speci￾mens and washings increases the diagnostic yield of bronchos￾copy in patients with lung cancer. The systematic review and
meta-analysis carried out by the American College of Chest
Physicians145 identified 35 studies of patients with central
disease undergoing bronchoscopy. The pooled data in 4507

patients demonstrated an overall combined sensitivity of 88%
for bronchoscopic techniques. Biopsy of visible lesions alone
had a yield of 74% while washings had a sensitivity of 48% and
yield from brushings was 59%. McLean et al146 analysed 2238
bronchoscopies carried out between January 1991 and
December 1992 in five centres in Scotland. When endobron￾chial tumour was seen, sensitivity for brushings and washings
combined was 47%. The yield from biopsy alone was 82% and
when combined with brushings and washings the yield increased
to 87%. When the tumour was not visible the sensitivity of
brushings and washings combined was 9%.146
The optimal number of bronchial biopsy specimens in cases
of visible endobronchial tumour has also been studied.,
Gellert147 demonstrated that at least five samples are required to
achieve a 90% probability of a positive malignant biopsy for a
visible tumour.147 Popovich et al148 demonstrated in peripheral
lung cancer lesions biopsied using TBLB that only a 45% diag￾nostic yield was achieved with one biopsy and in some cases the
diagnosis was not achieved before the fifth or sixth biopsy. They
suggested that up to 10 biopsies may be required.
Based on recent evidence, it is reasonable to expect a diagnos￾tic yield of 85% when the tumour is visible at bronchoscopy
using bronchial biopsy.149 150 Slade et al149 examined the diag￾nostic yield from FB at a single centre between 2001 and 2007.
In patients with tumour visible at bronchoscopy, the yield
increased from 75% in 2001 to 94.5% in 2007.
The management of patients with advanced NSCLC now
depends on the phenotyping and genotyping of lung cancer.151
However, the currently available evidence does not clarify
whether this is routinely possible with bronchoscopic samples
and in particular whether bronchial brushings and washings are
suitable for subclassification of NSCLC. Studies of the
sequence of biopsies, brushings and washings suggest that the
order of sample acquisition is not important.152 However, to
maximise the volume of tissue to allow the phenotyping and
genotyping of advanced NSCLC, bronchial brushings and
washings may be taken after sufficient biopsy specimens have
been taken.
In addition to providing pathological information, bronchos￾copy enables the location and extent of an endobronchial lesion
to be determined. Careful assessment of the vocal cords is
mandatory, since the presence of vocal cord palsy may provide
evidence of mediastinal invasion (and thus inoperability).
Bronchoscopy also allows for accurate assessment of the loca￾tion and therefore T staging of an endobronchial tumour which
may have implications for surgical treatment.
Recommendations for FB in performing conventional TBNA
and endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) TBNA as a diagnostic
technique for lung cancer are discussed in the BTS guideline for
advanced diagnostic and therapeutic FB in adults, which also
includes a guide on how to perform TBNA.3
Evidence statements
▸ In patients with visible endobronchial tumour a diagnostic
yield of at least 85% is achievable. (Evidence level 2+)
▸ A minimum of five biopsies should be taken when endobron￾chial tumour is visible. (Evidence level 3)
▸ The diagnostic yield from bronchoscopy can be increased by
undertaking brush and lavage specimens in addition to bron￾chial biopsy. (Evidence level 3)
Recommendations
▸ A diagnostic level of 85% should be attainable when definite
endobronchial tumour is visible. (Grade B)
▸ At least five biopsy samples should be taken when endobron￾chial tumour is visible to maximise diagnostic yield and the
volume of biopsy tissue and to allow for tumour phenotyp￾ing and genotyping. (Grade D)
▸ When endobronchial tumour is visible, brushings and wash￾ings can increase the diagnostic yield of the procedure.
(Grade D)
▸ A chest CT scan should be performed prior to a diagnostic
bronchoscopy in patients with suspected lung cancer.
(Grade D)
Interstitial lung disease
Bronchoscopy is a useful diagnostic tool in some ILDs, particu￾larly sarcoidosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis and organising
pneumonia.153 BAL and TBLB are frequently performed in sus￾pected cases of ILD.
TBLB is a technique which uses biopsy forceps to obtain
alveolar tissue; it is particularly useful in obtaining histological
specimens for suspected cases of ILD, although crush artefact
during the procedure may render the samples inadequate for
histological diagnosis, particularly in idiopathic pulmonary
fibrosis. The size of forceps used does not appear to affect the
diagnostic yield (see appendix 10 for a step-by-step guide on
how to perform TBLB).153 A retrospective review of 452 bron￾choscopies in localised and diffuse lesions examined by TBLB
demonstrated a diagnostic yield in 55.2% of patients with a
localised lesion and 67% in those with diffuse lesions. The
study also demonstrated an increase in the diagnostic yield with
an increasing number of specimens, so that taking more than
four biopsies increased the yield from 52% to more than
70%.43 The complication rate in this series was 6%; 5.8%
developed a pneumothorax (3.8% required intercostal
drainage) and significant bleeding was noted in 0.2%, suggesting
that TBLB is a useful diagnostic procedure with a low complica￾tion rate43
The use of BAL may be controversial, since its use in diagno￾sis and monitoring disease activity is limited in ILD, and its
current strength is in research in understanding the underlying
pathophysiological mechanisms in ILD.154 There is a suggestion
that combining techniques increases diagnostic yield. In a study
investigating patients with sarcoidosis, TBLB alone was diagnos￾tic in 58%, TBNA alone was successful in diagnosing 17% of
cases as was BAL alone; combining all three procedures led to a
100% diagnostic rate.155
No evidence currently exists for the coexistent use of BAL
with TBLB, however it is reasonable to perform both these pro￾cedures in cases of suspected ILD. BAL and TBLB should be
performed in areas shown to be affected on high-resolution CT
(HRCT)156 and both procedures should be performed on the
same lung. In those with typical HRCT features of idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis, BAL and TBLB are not required for
diagnosis.
Diagnostic bronchoscopic procedures have moderate
(67–74%) diagnostic sensitivity in patients with diffuse
ILD,157 158 but have high diagnostic sensitivity in cases of sar￾coidosis. In a study of 530 consecutive TBLBs in patients with
diffuse infiltrates, the overall diagnostic yield was 50% and 75%
for stage II–III sarcoidosis. The diagnostic yield of hypersensitiv￾ity pneumonitis in this series was 92%. In a case series of 183
patients with bilateral diffuse shadowing, Mitchell et al159
demonstrated that TBLB had a diagnostic yield of 77% for
patients with sarcoidosis.
The diagnostic sensitivity of TBLB and BAL in sarcoidosis is
estimated to be between 56% and 77%, increasing with the
severity of the disease.157 159–164 One study demonstrated the
sensitivity of TBLB to be 55% in stage I disease, 80% in stage II

disease and 82% in stage III disease.162 In sarcoidosis, EBB may
also prove useful, even without visible endobronchial abnormal￾ity, particularly when parenchymal disease exists.163 Combining
techniques will improve diagnostic yield.160 161 Mediastinal
lymphadenopathy can be sampled by conventional or ultra￾sound guided TBNA—please refer to the BTS guideline for
advanced diagnostic and therapeutic FB in adults for specific
recommendations and evidence.3
A minimum of five to six TBLB samples should be taken
and increasing the number of samples will increase the diag￾nostic yield, particularly in those with a localised lesion.164
A direct correlation has been shown between the number of
TBLBs taken and diagnostic yield, with a 35% diagnostic
yield for one to three biopsies, increasing to 69% with 6–10
biopsies.164 Furthermore, Popovich et al148 demonstrated in
peripheral lung cancer lesions biopsied using TBLB that only
a 45% diagnostic yield was achieved with one biopsy and in
some cases the diagnosis was not achieved before the fifth
or sixth biopsy. They suggested that up to 10 biopsies may
be required.
There is conflicting evidence regarding the use of fluoroscopy
during TBLB. A retrospective review by Anders et al of 112
TBLBs performed with fluoroscopy and 135 without fluoros￾copy found no significant difference in the yield (72.3% vs
67.4%); however the yield for localised lesions was lower
without fluoroscopy.165 Fluoroscopy may be useful when per￾forming TBLB on localised peripheral lesions. The diagnostic
rate of TBLB without fluoroscopy varies between 60% and
65%,159 166 and with fluoroscopy 55.2–
73%43 165 for localised
lesions. It has therefore been suggested that fluoroscopy may be
useful when performing TBLB on localised peripheral lesions.
Two studies have demonstrated that knowledge of the location
of the lesion from chest radiograph aids diagnostic yield. To
ensure that peripheral localised lesions are being accessed cor￾rectly, fluoroscopy may therefore be required.43 167 The inci￾dence of pneumothorax following TBLB without fluoroscopy is
between 3% and 5%,166 168 although one study demonstrated
no increase in the incidence of pneumothoraces (0.015%).157 A
chest x-ray may be performed immediately if pneumothorax is
suspected or the patient is symptomatic, or be done at least 2 h
after TBLB to exclude pneumothorax.47
Evidence statements
▸ EBBs should be performed in patients with suspected sar￾coidosis. Yield increases in patients with radiographic evi￾dence of parenchymal disease. (Evidence level 2+)
▸ TBLBs should be performed in patients with radiographic
stage II—IV sarcoidosis. (Evidence level 2+)
▸ At least five to six TBLBs should be performed in patients
with ILD. (Evidence level 2−)
▸ There is no convincing evidence that the use of fluoroscopy
reduces pneumothorax rate or diagnostic yield in non-focal
lung disease. (Evidence level 3)
Recommendations
▸ In suspected sarcoidosis, EBBs should be considered to
increase the diagnostic yield. (Grade C)
▸ TBLB is recommended for the diagnosis of stage II–IV sar￾coidosis. (Grade C)
▸ In patients with diffuse ILD, five to six TBLBs should be
taken from the same lung. (Grade D)
▸ Fluoroscopy should be considered for TBLB in patients with
localised or focal parenchymal lung disease. (Grade D)
Good practice point
▸ Bronchoscopists should keep a record of their personal diag￾nostic accuracy for FB. (√)
Diagnosis of infection
Bronchoscopy is a useful procedure to diagnose infection when
less invasive methods to diagnose the underlying aetiology are
not suitable.
This section includes basic sampling methods (bronchial
wash, BAL, TBLB, EBB and bronchial brush) but does not
include advanced techniques such as EBUS TBNA, which are
covered in the advanced bronchoscopy guidelines.3
The spectrum of infections encountered in immunocomprom￾ised hosts differs from that seen in immunocompetent indivi￾duals. The role of FB in obtaining diagnostic samples in these
two patient groups also differs
Bronchoscopy in the diagnosis of infection in the
immunocompromised host
The underlying aetiology for pneumonia in patients who are
immunocompromised varies with the prevalence of disease in
the community and with geographical area. Studies performed
in Africa where there is a high prevalence of TB have shown the
most common organism causing pneumonia in patients with
HIV-related immunosuppression is mycobacterium TB.169 170 In
Western countries with a lower prevalence of TB, commonly
encountered organisms are Pneumocystis jiroveci, fungal infec￾tions, bacterial infections and viral infections such as cytomega￾lovirs and Cryptococcus.
171–173 A variety of bronchoscopic
techniques can be used depending on the local population,
disease prevalence and host defences (figure 1).
Bronchoalveolar lavage
BAL has been shown to have high sensitivity in P jiroveci pneu￾monia. In the absence of prior antibiotic use for treatment or
prophylaxis, BAL is reported to have a sensitivity between 90%
and 98% for P jiroveci.
174–179 Prior use of empiric antibiotic
treatment reduces the sensitivity to around 64%.178 Bilateral
BAL sampling has a higher diagnostic yield compared with uni￾lateral BAL179 and BAL from upper lobes has higher sensitivity
compared with lower or middle lobe sampling techniques.180 181
The comparable sensitivity of BAL to transbronchial biopsy,176
but with fewer inherent risks, means that BAL is regarded as the
gold standard investigation for suspected P jiroveci infection.
BAL in patients who are immunocompromised with smear￾negative pulmonary TB has been reported to have a sensitivity
of 10–30% based on microscopy182–184 and a sensitivity of
52–95% on culture.182–184 When PCR techniques are used on
BAL material, a rapid diagnosis of TB with reported sensitivity
of 85.7% and specificity of 90.9%185 have been reported.
Serological tests on BAL in patients with HIV (unlike those
without HIV) with suspected pulmonary TB have shown a
lower sensitivity, but the specificity remains high.185
In invasive aspergillosis, BAL is reported to show characteris￾tic hyphae in 34–64%186–188 and to be positive on cultures for
Aspergillus in 23–85% of cases.186–188 If available, galactoman￾nan antigen detection on BAL is useful. A meta-analysis looking
at the performance of BAL galactomannan testing in detection
of proven invasive aspergillosis suggested that the test has a sen￾sitivity of 94% and a specificity of 79%.189 Unlike the serum
galactomannan test, BAL galactomannan is equally sensitive in
patients with haematological or other causes of immunosuppres￾sion.190 There have been reports of false-positive results when
using the serum galactomannan test, especially in patients who
are receiving certain β-lactam antibiotics.191–194 The reported
sensitivity for PCR on BAL in cases of invasive aspergillosis is
67–100% and the specificity 96–100%.195 196 The PCR

techniques have some limitations, including lack of standardisa￾tion for processing of samples.
BAL and bronchial washings in patients who are immuno￾compromised with bacterial pneumonia have been shown to
change the diagnosis in 50% and change antibiotic therapy in
62% of patients who are HIV positive.197 In patients with AIDS
and suspected cryptococcal disease, bronchoscopies with BAL
and bronchial washings have a combined sensitivity on smear
equal to that of TBLB and superior to that of TBLB fungal
culture.198
TBLB/EBB and brush biopsies
TBLB has been reported to have a comparable yield to BAL in
cases of P jiroveci pneumonia in some studies,171 199 200 although
other studies have shown it to be inferior175 176 and some have
shown it to have higher sensitivity than BAL.177 Since TBLB
carries the risk of pneumothorax of between 2.5% and
3.7%,176 177 it is not recommended in patients with suspected P
jiroveci pneumonia. In areas of low TB prevalence where
Pneumocystis is more likely to be responsible for infection,173
TBLB may not be required during the initial bronchoscopy.
In cases of pulmonary TB in immunocompromised hosts, the
sensitivity of TBLB based on positive microscopic examination
is reported to be between 19%183 and 39%.182 Although fewer
granulomata are seen on TBLB in patients who are immuno￾compromised compared with those who are immunocompetent,
TBLB was the reported exclusive method of diagnosis in around
13% of patients in a study.183 The overall reported sensitivity
for cultures of TBLB is reported to be 42–52%.182–184
EBB and TBLB have a lower diagnostic yield compared with
BAL in the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis.197 201 Biopsy may
confirm the presence of hyphae and demonstrate pathogno￾monic tissue damage due to hyphae. Careful consideration must
therefore be given to the risk versus benefit, especially the risk
of bleeding if concurrent thrombocytopenia is present, or of
pneumothorax in these critically ill patients.
Brush biopsies to diagnose P jiroveci pneumonia have been
consistently found to have lower sensitivity compared with
BAL, with reported sensitivity between 29% and
52%.171 175 176 199 Due to its limited sensitivity, brush biopsy
has a limited role in this setting.
Evidence statements
▸ BAL has excellent yield in P jiroveci pneumonia and is now
considered the gold standard. (Evidence level 3)
▸ BAL has a good diagnostic yield for the majority of infec￾tions and may be sufficient as the only bronchoscopic investi￾gation in countries with a low prevalence of TB. (Evidence
level 3)
▸ BAL can show characteristic hyphae and has moderate sensi￾tivity for invasive aspergillosis based on cultures.(Evidence
level 3)
▸ BAL galactomannan test has excellent sensitivity and specifi￾city for invasive aspergillosis and should be considered if
available. (Evidence level 3)
▸ Post-bronchoscopy sputum is a complementary method of col￾lecting material for staining for AFB and should be collected if
the patient is able to provide a sample. (Evidence level 3)
Recommendations
▸ In patients with pulmonary infiltrates who are immunocom￾promised and in whom TB is considered unlikely, BAL alone
is usually sufficient to achieve a diagnosis. In areas or popula￾tions with high prevalence of TB, TBLB may be considered
in addition. (Grade C)
▸ BAL or bronchial washings should be sent for microscopy
for AFB and for mycobacterial culture in patients with pneu￾monia who are immunocompromised. (Grade C)
▸ Post-bronchoscopy sputum could be collected in patients
who are immunocompromised and suspected to have TB.
(Grade D)
▸ TBLB and EBB for invasive aspergillosis may be avoided if
BAL galactomannan test is available due to the high sensitiv￾ity and specificity of the latter and inherent risks with the
biopsies. (Grade C)

should be sent for microscopy for hyphae and fungal
culture; a BAL galactomannan test should be considered to
further improve diagnostic yield. (Grade C)
Bronchoscopy in the diagnosis of infection in the
immunocompetent host
There are no randomised trials to compare the outcome of inva￾sive tests such as bronchoscopy in the early phase of infection
with non-invasive tests and/or empirical treatment in cases of
community-acquired pneumonia. The current guidelines on
management of community-acquired pneumonia recommend
the use of non-invasive investigations. In patients with moderate
to severe disease, bronchoscopy should be reserved for patients
whose condition fails to respond.202 203 The role of bronchos￾copy in the early phase of management of a patient with
community-acquired pneumonia may be quite limited.
Bronchoscopy should be considered in patients whose condi￾tion fails to respond to initial treatment for community-acquired
pneumonia. In this setting, FB can help to exclude underlying
lung cancer which can be present in a significant proportion of
patients with non-resolving pneumonia204 FB is also useful in
this patient group to diagnose and remove aspirated organic or
inorganic material. In adults, the presence of a non-resolving
pneumonia, lung abscess, atelectasis or collapse can indicate
possible aspiration.205 FB is the first-line investigation of choice
in adults to remove aspirated material with reported success
rates of up to 100% in experienced hands.205 A bronchoscopy
in patients whose condition has failed to respond to treatment
provides an opportunity to collect additional samples for micro￾bial cultures.
In patients who are suspected to have TB but are unable to
provide an adequate sputum sample, bronchoscopy can be used as
an alternative to induced sputum to obtain material for staining.
The overall combined yield of bronchoscopy in patients with nega￾tive sputum smears, with procedures such as BAL, bronchial biop￾sies, bronchial wash and post-bronchoscopy sputum, is reported to
be 28.8–48.3%206 207 based on microscopy and smears for AFB
and 69.2–94%206 208 209 based on cultures.
BAL and bronchial aspirate
Bronchial aspirates obtained for the purpose of culture and sen￾sitivity have a significant false-positive rate due to contamination
with upper respiratory tract secretions.210 Protected catheters
have a lower risk of contamination.211 Protected catheter and
BAL samples have a reported sensitivity based on quantitative
cultures of 64.7–70% and 73.8–77% respectively in patients
with community-acquired pneumonia who had a bronchoscopy
within 12 h of hospital admission.212 213 The yield is lower
when bronchoscopy is performed after treatment failure (lack of
response after 72 h).214
BAL also provides suitable material for other tests such as
PCR and antigen detection. Performing the pneumococcal
antigen test on BAL is reported to have a sensitivity of 54–95%
and a specificity of 86.8–100% for pneumococcal pneumo￾nia.215 216 When available, use of PCR on BAL has been shown
to be useful in the detection of legionella,217 218 with reported
sensitivity and specificity approaching 100%.218 It has been sug￾gested that samples should routinely be sent for legionella PCR
if bronchoscopy is performed.202
In patients with suspected TB and negative sputum smear,
BAL and bronchial aspirates range in sensitivity from 23% to
28% on smears207 219 and 32–88% on cultures.207 208 219
Studies have shown a high sensitivity of PCR when performed
on BAL fluid with a range of 78–80.9%.220 221 The ability to
make an early diagnosis by using PCR can be further enhanced
by performing BAL smears at the same time.221 BAL PCR
appears to have a false-positive rate of around 4.4%.220 Tests on
BAL, such as enzyme-linked immunospot have high sensitivity
and specificity and can rapidly distinguish between smear￾negative pulmonary TB and latent TB infection.222 223
EBB and TBLB
EBB or TBLB are useful in the diagnosis of slowly or non￾resolving pneumonia if there are any visible endobronchial
abnormalities or if there is a possibility of TB. There is no evi￾dence to suggest they are useful as a routine test in patients with
pneumonia.
In patients with proven pulmonary TB, bronchial and brush
biopsies show typical granulomata in 3.84–53% of
cases.206 219 224 Post-bronchoscopy sputum is culture positive in
14–46% of patients and sputum should be cultured if the patient
is able to provide an adequate sample.207 208
Evidence statements
▸ A significant proportion of patients (11%) with non-resolving
pneumonia, who are over 50 and are ex-smokers or current
smokers, may have underlying carcinoma. Bronchoscopy can
play an important role in diagnosing endobronchial lesions,
especially if there is an additional history of weight loss of
>3 kg in the preceding 3 months. (Evidence level 2−)
▸ PCR for legionella on BAL specimens has a sensitivity
approaching 100%. (Evidence level 2+)
▸ In TB, BAL, bronchial aspirates and post-bronchoscopy
sputum all contribute to the overall diagnostic yield.
(Evidence level 2+)
▸ In high-prevalence areas, routine samples for culture and
microscopy for TB confirm TB in 6–8% of patients, even if
bronchoscopy is performed for another indication. (Evidence
level 2+)
Recommendations
▸ Bronchoscopy may be considered in patients with non￾resolving or slowly resolving pneumonia, especially if they
are current or ex smokers and older than 50 years. (Grade C)
▸ If bronchoscopy is performed for community-acquired pneu￾monia, BAL specimens should be sent for legionella PCR
and atypical pathogens. (Grade C)
▸ Bronchoscopy may be considered if the patient is suspected
to have TB when sputum smear is negative. (Grade C)
▸ In cases of suspected TB, BAL, bronchial aspirates, and post￾bronchoscopy sputum appear to be complementary and
should all be analysed. (Grade C)
▸ In areas with high or intermediate prevalence of TB, patients
undergoing bronchoscopy for another indication should have
samples sent routinely for cultures for TB. (Grade C)
BRONCHOSCOPY IN THE ICU
FB facilitates inspection of the upper airways and bronchial tree
in critically ill patients in the ICU. In non-intubated patients the
risks of bronchoscopy are those described in the section on
‘Monitoring, precautions and complications’. However, bron￾choscopy in the ICU commonly involves intubated patients sup￾ported by mechanical ventilation, with significant other illness
and comorbidities, and therefore bronchoscopy requires careful
consideration in this patient population.
Bronchoscopes used in the ICU
The specifications of a bronchoscope suitable for use in the ICU
require a degree of compromise. The internal diameter of the

ET may restrict the size of the bronchoscope, while efficient suc￾tioning requires a larger bronchoscope with a wide suction
channel. The internal diameter of the tracheal tube relative to
the external diameter of the bronchoscope is an important con￾sideration. Bronchoscopes in the non-intubated patient occupy
only 10–15% of the cross-sectional area of the trachea. In con￾trast, a 5.7 mm bronchoscope occupies 40% of a 9 mm ET and
66% of a 7 mm tracheal tube. Failure to recognise this may lead
to inadequate ventilation of the patient and impaction of or
damage to the bronchoscope.
Lubrication is essential to facilitate passage of the broncho￾scope. Tracheostomy tubes are prone to damage the broncho￾scope, particularly during withdrawal when the rigid edge of
the end of the tracheostomy tube can abrade the covering of the
bronchoscope.
A single model (non-human) study addresses the issue of
airway support device and size of bronchoscope.225 In this
study, the laryngeal mask airway (LMA), reinforced LMA
(RLMA) and ET were assessed in a simulated model of ventila￾tion, measuring flow resistance during simulated inspiration and
the maximum size of flexible bronchoscope (using oesophageal
dilators to mimic six different sizes of bronchoscope
(2.7–8.9 mm external diameter)). This study demonstrated that
the LMA can accommodate a larger bronchoscope than the cor￾responding sizes of RLMA and ET. Mean flow resistance was
2.3 (1.7–3.5) times higher with the RLMA and 2.1 (1.2–4.2)
times higher with the ET compared with the LMA, and 1.2
(0.7–1.8) times lower with the ET compared with the RLMA.
Removal of the LMA aperture bars resulted in a mean decrease
in flow resistance of 3.6%. The study provides useful informa￾tion on the maximum external diameter of the bronchoscope to
be used with different airway devices. This information is pro￾vided in appendix 11 of this guideline.
Recommendation
▸ The external diameter of a bronchoscope used in the ICU
setting should be carefully selected according to the external
diameter of the bronchoscope, the size of the airway support
device (ET or laryngeal mask) and the type of airway device
used. (Grade D)
Indications for FB in the ICU
FB may be performed in the ICU for a wide range of diagnostic
or therapeutic indications. These are considered separately in
the sections below.
Treatment of lobar collapse
Bronchoscopy has been used to treat lobar collapse in intubated
patients whose condition has failed to respond to treatments
such as physiotherapy. Retained bronchial secretions may
obstruct major airways, and local directed suction using a wide
channel bronchoscope combined with saline instillation has
been used to treat this condition.
A total of four case series226–229 (totalling 47 patients) and
one case report230 have reported the use of bronchoscopy in
ventilated patients to reverse lobar atelectasis, with good imme￾diate outcome reported in all studies. All such studies are non￾comparative and therefore subject to bias. However, bronchos￾copy may be considered in patients with lobar atelectasis which
is not responding to conventional treatment.
One randomised trial has been conducted assessing the utility
of bronchoscopy in the prevention of atelectasis in 29 patients,
ventilated after thoracic surgery (lobectomy).231 In this study,
there was no difference in any outcome measured (including
blood gases, spirometry, the need for further bronchoscopy,
radiology, ICU and hospital stay) between those treated using
bronchoscopy and those treated with suction and physiotherapy
(standard care).
Evidence statement
▸ A well conducted randomised trial demonstrates no benefit
in the use of bronchoscopy compared with physiotherapy
and suction in the prevention of post-lobectomy atelectasis in
ventilated patients. (Evidence level 1+)
Recommendations
▸ Prophylactic bronchoscopy and lavage should not be used to
prevent post-lobectomy atelectasis in ventilated patients.
(Grade A)
▸ Bronchoscopy may be considered in specific circumstances
for the relief of atelectasis in intubated and ventilated
patients. (Grade D)
Diagnosis and management of haemoptysis/haemorrhage
A minor degree of endotracheal bleeding is common during
routine tracheal suctioning and may result from tracheal epithe￾lial abrasions. If an intubated patient has persistent or excessive
bleeding through the ET, bronchoscopy may identify the source
and extent of the haemorrhage.
A total of two case series report the utility of bronchoscopy
in the management or diagnosis of haemoptysis/haemorrhage in
ventilated patients.232 233 A case series of seven patients reports
control of haemorrhage in six of seven patients using broncho￾scopic intervention (saline/adrenaline instillation) after an
average of 5.9 treatments per patient, with one patient reported
as dying of haemorrhage.232
A larger case series has retrospectively compared the utility of
bronchoscopy and CT in the diagnosis and management of
haemoptysis in 80 cases of haemoptysis in ventilated patients.233
A bleeding site was identified with bronchoscopy in 71 (89%)
vs 64 (80%) with HRCT (p>0.3). The two techniques together
diagnosed the site of bleeding in 96%. The final cause of haem￾optysis was identified by bronchoscopy in only two patients,
compared with 49 patients using HRCT.
CT is therefore likely to be the first-line diagnostic test in
haemoptysis/haemorrhage in ventilated patients. Bronchoscopy
may be diagnostically useful in specific circumstances when
haemoptysis occurs in mechanically ventilated patients (eg, for
the diagnosis of diffuse alveolar haemorrhage on broncho￾scopic samples), but there is no evidence that directly addresses
this issue. FB may be used in the management of haemoptysis
in mechanically ventilated patients, but the evidence for its effi￾cacy is scanty, and consideration should be given to local
resources and other feasible techniques (eg, rigid bronchoscopy,
surgery or interventional radiology) depending on the clinical
situation.
Recommendation
▸ Bronchoscopy may be considered in ventilated patients with
haemoptysis if CT imaging has been performed and is
unhelpful, or is not possible. (Grade D)
Diagnosis of infection in ICU/ventilated patients
Bronchoscopically directed lavage or brushing techniques and
‘non-invasive’ techniques (blind catheter brushes) can be used to
obtain microbiological samples in ventilated patients with sus￾pected ventilator-associated pneumonia. Either qualitative or
quantitative microbiological techniques can be used to analyse
the samples obtained.
There are a large number of case series assessing the utility of
bronchoscopy in the diagnosis of infection in ventilated
patients234–257 which show great variability in the gold standard

used for the diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia
(autopsy, clinical course, bronchoscopy results), the microbio￾logical cut-off threshold for the diagnosis of confirmed infection
(number of colony-forming units, number of intracellular organ￾isms) and the exact bronchoscopic and non-bronchoscopic tech￾niques used (BAL, protected telescope brush, telescoping
catheters). This results in a wide range of reported sensitivities
of bronchoscopic techniques (51–100%), and variable compari￾son to non-invasive techniques. Overall, bronchoscopy and
lavage or brushing appears to be safe for microbiological diag￾nosis in ventilated patients.
A well conducted systematic review conducted in 2008258 and
then repeated in 2012259 included five randomised trials (total￾ling 1367 patients) which assessed the utility of invasive
(bronchoscopic) versus non-invasive (blind catheter brush and
other blind techniques) in reducing mortality and ICU stay in
ventilated patients with clinically diagnosed ventilator-associated
pneumonia. Comparing quantitative and qualitative cultures
(1240 patients), there were no statistically significant differences
in mortality rates (RR=0.91, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.11). In addition,
there was no evidence of mortality reduction in the invasive
group versus the non-invasive group (RR=0.93, 95% CI 0.78
to 1.11) and no significant differences between the interventions
in the number of days on mechanical ventilation, length of ICU
stay or antibiotic change.
Thus, evidence from a well conducted systematic review259 sug￾gests that bronchoscopic (invasive) techniques are not superior to
less invasive techniques as a diagnostic strategy in ventilated
patients with suspected pneumonia, with no improvement in clin￾ically meaningful outcomes (mortality, ICU stay, days ventilated)
using more invasive diagnostic strategies. As bronchoscopic techni￾ques are more invasive with no demonstrated benefit over less
invasive techniques, this evidence suggests bronchoscopy should
not be used in preference to non-invasive diagnostic strategies.
However, when non-invasive diagnostic strategies are not avail￾able, bronchoscopy to confirm diagnosis may be a reasonable
option, although there is no direct evidence to address this issue.
The evidence above does not address the issue of diagnosis of
non-ventilator-associated pneumonia in ventilated patients (eg,
patients with community-acquired pneumonia who subsequently
require ventilation).
Evidence statement
▸ In the diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia, invasive
diagnostic strategies using bronchoscopy are not associated
with improvement in clinically important outcomes in venti￾lated patients (mortality, length of ventilation and length of
ICU stay) compared with ‘non-invasive’ techniques.
(Evidence level 1−)
Recommendations
▸ Directed non-invasive diagnostic strategies (eg, blind catheter
aspiration) should be used first line in preference to bron￾choscopy in ventilated patients with suspected ventilator￾associated pneumonia. (Grade A)
▸ When such non-invasive diagnostic techniques fail to identify
a responsible organism, bronchoscopy should be considered
for the diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
(Grade D)
Transbronchial biopsies and needle aspiration in the ICU/
ventilated patients
Transbronchial biopsy may be considered in selected patients for
histological diagnosis. A single case series reports the utility of
transbronchial biopsy under fluoroscopy in 13 ventilated
patients with progressive infiltrates.260 Transbronchial biopsy
established the diagnosis in six (46%), and was considered
helpful in treatment of all these patients. However, significant
complications occurred in 31% (two pneumothoraces requiring
drainage, one haemorrhage and one arrhythmia), although no
deaths were attributed to the procedure. On the basis of this
limited evidence, transbronchial biopsy should be cautiously
used in intubated/ventilated patients, with poor diagnostic yields
(<50%) and significant potential harm.
A small (eight patient) retrospective case series described the
use of TBNA in ventilated patients with abnormal lymph nodes
identified on CT scan.261 In this series, there were no complica￾tions, and discounting a single case in which a definitive diagno￾sis could not be obtained, TBNA had a sensitivity of 83% and a
specificity of 100% (giving positive predictive value of 100%,
negative predictive value of 50%). In five of eight (63%) cases,
TBNA led to a change in management.
This small case series suggests that TBNA may be a useful
procedure in highly selected mechanically ventilated patients.
Diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome
A randomised crossover study has been conducted comparing
the diagnostic utility of bronchoscopy and catheter lavage in dif￾ferentiating acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (n=21)
from those at risk of ARDS (n=20) using cell profiles.262
Although this study was well conducted and demonstrated that
bronchoscopy and BAL can distinguish between ARDS and
acute lung injury when catheter lavage cannot, the diagnostic
methods used (total protein, protein permeability, epithelial
lining fluid volume and myeloperoxidase) are research tools and
not in current standard practice, and the clinical implications
are unknown.
Precautions and contraindications to bronchoscopy on the ICU
Critically ill patients represent a high risk group for most inva￾sive procedures. They will often present with hypoxia, electro￾lyte disturbances, clotting abnormalities and arrhythmias. It is
therefore important that the potential benefits of bronchoscopy
outweigh the risks. Elevated prothrombin time, increased acti￾vated partial thromboplastin time, reduced fibrinogen titre or
thrombocytopenia indicate clotting dysfunction which makes
biopsy procedures hazardous. Critically ill patients may be more
susceptible to the toxic effects of local anaesthetics. However, in
the ventilated patient intravenous sedation or anaesthesia is
probably the most appropriate alternative.
A case series of 37 ventilated patients with severe thrombocyto￾penia (platelets<50) undergoing bronchoscopy (33 BALs, 5
TBLBs)263 demonstrated only two deaths associated with the pro￾cedure (5.4%), one of which was secondary to a major airway
bleed. Minor tracheobronchial bleeds requiring no treatment were
seen in 32%. In this study, it is not clear which patients required
platelet transfusions. However, overall, it would appear that bron￾choscopy in patients with low platelets is feasible (if corrected) but
associated with significant potential harm.
In a case series of 110 mechanically ventilated, highly selected
patients with ARDS on standard criteria (excluded if partial
pressure of O2 <80 mm Hg on FiO2 of 1.0, hypotension,
ischaemic heart disease, raised ICP or ET <7 mm diameter),
bronchoscopy and BAL appeared to be relatively safe in the
short term (1 h) with no clinically significant changes in oxygen￾ation.264 One episode of pneumothorax (without transbronchial
biopsy) occurred. Thus bronchoscopy and BAL appear to be

safe in the short term in highly selected patients with ARDS in
terms of oxygenation.
Recommendations
▸ Patients in the ICU should be considered at high risk from
complications when undergoing bronchoscopy. (Grade D)
▸ All potential risk factors (ventilator parameters, clotting dys￾function) should be corrected as far as possible before under￾taking bronchoscopy. (Grade D)
Good practice point
▸ The risks and benefits of bronchoscopy should be carefully
considered in mechanically ventilated patients. (√)
Monitoring
A full range of physiological monitoring is available in the ICU,
including ECG (for heart rate and rhythm), continuous
intra-arterial blood pressure or intermittent cuff blood pressure
measurement, pulse oximetry (SpO2) and end-tidal CO2 moni￾toring. Setting appropriate alarm limits for heart rate, blood
pressure and SpO2 and requesting other attendant staff to
monitor physiological variables during the bronchoscopy allows
close monitoring for deterioration during the procedure.
Adverse events require immediate withdrawal of the broncho￾scope and resuscitation of the patient. The clinician must then
weigh the benefits against the risks of proceeding further.
A total of 13 studies have addressed potential physiological
parameters which may be altered by bronchoscopy in ventilated/
ICU patients.239 243 246 263–271 A randomised trial of different
BAL volumes using bronchoscopy in mechanically ventilated
patients demonstrated the procedure to be associated with a
worsening of PaO2/FiO2 ratio.265 A number of case series
suggest bronchoscopy and BAL are associated with variable and
sometimes non-significant increases in mean arterial pressure,
mean pulmonary artery pressure and CO2 in ventilated
patients.264 266–271 Bronchoscopy and BAL are associated with
worsened hypoxia and tachycardia in several studies in mechan￾ically ventilated patients,239 243 263–269 271 although these
changes were clinically insignificant in most patients. In a spe￾cific study with a specific subgroup of patients with ARDS, a
more than 30% drop in PaO2 was observed in 35% of
patients.271 A more detailed physiological study in 18 patients
undergoing bronchoscopy and BAL has demonstrated adverse
change in lung compliance and resistance.267 Post-bronchoscopy
pneumothorax has been reported in ventilated patients in whom
transbronchial biopsy was not undertaken.246 264
Evidence statements
▸ Bronchoscopy with BAL in mechanically ventilated patients
has been shown to be associated with a worsened oxygen￾ation, with an 80–86% reduction in PaO2/FiO2 ratio from
baseline regardless of the volume of BAL used. (Evidence
level 1+)
▸ BAL has been associated with a change in lung compliance,
an increase in mean arterial pressure, mean pulmonary artery
pressure and rise in CO2 in ventilated patients. Hypoxia and
tachycardia have been shown to be a result of BAL in several
studies in mechanically ventilated patients, although these
were clinically insignificant in most patients. (Evidence
level 3)
▸ Post-bronchoscopy pneumothorax can occur in mechanically
ventilated patients in the absence of TBLB. (Evidence level 3)
Recommendations
▸ Continuous multimodal physiological monitoring should
be undertaken during and after bronchoscopy in the ICU
setting. (Grade C)
▸ Patients should be monitored post procedure for complica￾tions, including pneumothorax even when a biopsy has not
been taken. (Grade D)
Ventilator settings
Preoxygenation should be achieved by increasing the inspired
oxygen concentration to 100%. One hundred percent oxygen
should be given during bronchoscopy and in the immediate
recovery period. The ventilator should be adjusted to a manda￾tory setting. Triggered modes such as pressure support or assist
control will not reliably maintain ventilation during bronchos￾copy. The ventilator pressure limit should be increased to ensure
that adequate tidal volumes are delivered during each respira￾tory cycle and the ventilator rate increased if necessary. Most
modern microprocessor-controlled ventilators will monitor tidal
volume and minute ventilation.
A special swivel connector (Portex, Hythe, UK) with a perfo￾rated diaphragm, through which the bronchoscope can be
inserted, allows continued ventilation and maintenance of (posi￾tive end-expiratory pressure PEEP)/CPAP. This is particularly
important when performing a bronchoscopy in patients with
hypoxia (eg, ARDS) when maintenance of PEEP is important.
There is a small case series in normal human volunteers272
and a single study conducted in a dog model and six healthy
human volunteers273 in support of the use of jet ventilation via
the bronchoscope in ventilated patients. An 11-patient case
series in healthy volunteers is in support of the use of high￾frequency positive pressure ventilation during bronchoscopy.274
These techniques may be useful during bronchoscopy in the
ICU, but more robust comparative studies are needed to quan￾tify any potential benefit.
A total of three case series (totalling 46 patients)24 275 276
suggest non-invasive ventilation via mask or helmet may be
helpful in preventing progression to mechanical ventilation in
non-ventilated patients with hypoxia undergoing bronchoscopy,
but further studies are needed in this area. A small (n=30) but
well conducted randomised trial suggests CPAP plus oxygen is
superior to oxygen alone during bronchoscopy of patients with
hypoxia, preventing reduction in saturations and the need for
ventilator support post procedure.268 A single case series of 40
patients assessed those requiring non-invasive ventilation for
respiratory failure prior to a decision to conduct bronchos￾copy.277 In these patients, 4/40 (10%) required mechanical ven￾tilation within 8 h. Within 48 h, 45% were intubated, and in
total 55% required intubation (median time from bronchoscopy
to intubation=27 h). This implies that patients requiring non￾invasive ventilator support prior to bronchoscopy should be
considered high risk for requiring intubation post procedure,
and that the procedure should therefore be conducted by an
experienced operator in a setting where intubation and ventila￾tion can occur.
Monitoring intracranial pressure (ICP) in patients with a head
injury is essential if sudden rises in ICP are to be avoided due to
CO2 retention or other causes. Monitoring endotracheal CO2 in
such patients may also help to detect falls in minute ventilation
caused by the presence of the bronchoscope within the ET.
Profound anaesthesia, including effective neuromuscular blockade,
is often used in patients with head injury while undergoing bron￾choscopy. Four studies (one randomised controlled trial270 and
three others278–280) addressing this issue have consistently demon￾strated that bronchoscopy raises ICP. A small but well conducted
randomised study assessing hyperventilation via the ventilator
during bronchoscopy demonstrated no difference in peak ICP,270
but suggested hyperventilation may accelerate return to baseline

ICP after bronchoscopy in patients with closed head injury. The
significance of this treatment effect on clinically important recov￾ery is unknown. Three small non-randomised studies suggest that
while ICP is significantly raised during bronchoscopy, cerebral per￾fusion pressure is probably maintained.278–280
Evidence statements
▸ A small but well conducted randomised study suggests hyper￾ventilation via the ventilator is useful in reducing the
expected rise in ICP seen during bronchoscopy in ventilated
patients with closed head injury. (Evidence level 1−)
▸ A single but well conducted randomised trial suggests CPAP
plus oxygen is superior to oxygen alone during bronchos￾copy of patients with hypoxia, preventing reduction in
saturations and the need for ventilator support post proced￾ure. (Evidence level 1+)
▸ A total of three case series suggest non-invasive ventilation
may be helpful in preventing mechanical ventilation in
patients with hypoxia undergoing bronchoscopy, but further
studies are needed in this area. (Evidence level 3)
Recommendations
▸ CPAP plus oxygen support may be considered in patients
with hypoxia undergoing bronchoscopy to prevent desatur￾ation and post-procedure requirement for mechanical ventila￾tion. (Grade B)
▸ When patients require non-invasive ventilation prior to bron￾choscopy, the procedure should be conducted in an environ￾ment where intubation and ventilatory support are readily
accessible. (Grade D)
▸ Bronchoscopy should be undertaken cautiously in patients
with documented or suspected raised ICP. (Grade D)
Good practice point
▸ Care must be exercised to ensure adequate ventilation and
oxygenation is maintained during bronchoscopy in intubated
patients. (√)
Sedation and analgesia
The clinical status of the patient will often determine the type
and level of sedation required for bronchoscopy. Synthetic nar￾cotics such as alfentanil or fentanyl will suppress cough and
provide profound analgesia. Sedation can be induced using
incremental doses of a benzodiazepine or propofol. Some
patients may only require light sedation for comfort during
mechanical ventilation. In such cases bronchoscopy can be
undertaken with supplemental topical anaesthesia with ligno￾caine injected through the bronchoscope. However, care must
be exercised in patients with combinations of renal failure, liver
dysfunction and congestive heart failure when accumulation of
lignocaine may be associated with side effects (please see
section on ‘Tpoical anaesthesia’).
One case series of 104 patients undergoing bronchoscopy
during mechanical ventilation indirectly addressed the issue of
sedation level during bronchoscopy.271 The primary purpose of
the study was to assess gas exchange differences before and after
the procedure, however the study demonstrated significant falls
in oxygenation (PaO2 < 60 mm Hg with FiO2 = 0.8) in 14
patients, and this fall was independently associated in multivari￾ate analysis with the presence of ARDS and a clinician’s observa￾tion of the patient ‘fighting the ventilator’. This study therefore
provides weak indirect evidence that adequate sedation, to the
point of the patient not fighting the ventilator, may be helpful
in preventing hypoxia during bronchoscopy in ventilated
patients.
Evidence statement
▸ Adequate sedation, to the point of the patient not fighting
the ventilator, may be helpful in preventing hypoxia during
FB in ventilated patients. (Evidence level 3)
Recommendations
▸ Adequate sedation and analgesia should be provided for
patients undergoing bronchoscopy in an intensive care
setting. The risks of these procedures should be carefully
balanced with their potential benefit in ventilated patients.
(Grade D)
▸ Clinicians administering sedation/anaesthesia/analgesia
should be acquainted with the use of these agents, and the
anaesthetist/intensivist is usually best placed to fulfil this role.
(Grade D)
DECONTAMINATION
Flexible bronchoscopes are delicate, complex devices, with
channels and attachments that make them difficult to clean.
Although bronchoscopy carries a low risk of infection it is
essential that all stages of the decontamination process are con￾ducted correctly.
Since the last bronchoscopy guidelines were published in
20012 the body of new evidence relating to decontamination of
bronchoscopes is very limited (eight articles). Many of the
recommendations are based on expert opinion.
Most bronchoscopy procedures are carried out in endoscopy
units where British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) guidelines
on decontamination are followed.281 These guidelines were
reviewed in 2008282; the recommendations made by BSG
equally apply to bronchoscopes.
The NHS National Endoscopy Programme document
‘Decontamination standards for flexible endoscopes 2008’,
283
which was produced following the introduction of the Joint
Advisory Group on Gastrointestinal Endoscopy accreditation,
looks at safety and quality issues. This document may be consid￾ered as a basis for departmental policy. Guidelines from the
Medical Devices Agency (MDA) are also available.284 A cleaning
and disinfecting procedure can be found in appendix 12 of this
guideline.
Many of the problems identified in the literature suggest that
lack of training and poor adherence to decontamination proce￾dures are the main cause of infection/pseudo infection. An
MDA alert published in 2004 highlighted concerns with inad￾equate decontamination, including that of auxiliary channels.285
The Health Act 2006 stipulates the roles of decontamination
leads, the need for training programmes and monitoring
systems.286 Newer bronchoscopes, such as endobronchial ultra￾sound scopes, have extra channels, and therefore it is essential
that all staff are aware of the configuration of all scopes and
decontamination processes.
Recommendation
▸ All personnel involved in cleaning and decontaminating
bronchoscopes must receive specific training in infection
control practices and decontamination processes. (Grade D)
Traditionally bronchoscopes are decontaminated at the begin￾ning of a list. When a bronchoscope has been stored in a drying
cabinet or storage chamber the decontamination process prior
to its use may be omitted provided it is used within the manu￾facturer’s recommended time.
Recommendation
▸ Decontamination and disinfection should be carried out at
the beginning and end of each list and after each patient use.

If drying cabinets or storage chambers are unavailable
bronchoscopes should be decontaminated no more than 3 h
before the procedure to eliminate colonisation of pathogens.
(Grade D)
Designated cleaning areas should ensure safe decontamination
practice that allow adequate ventilation of hazardous substances
and do not harm staff and patients. A one-way flow for equip￾ment, with separate dirty and clean areas, should prevent cross
contamination.
Recommendation
▸ Bronchoscopes should be cleaned in designated cleaning
areas. Used scopes must be separated from clean scopes to
prevent cross contamination. (Grade D)
All stages of the decontamination process should be carried out
every time. Pre-cleaning prevents drying of particulate matter if
there is unavoidable delay in the decontamination process.
Standardised manual cleaning, immediately after use, removes
organic material from bronchoscopes to enable thorough disinfec￾tion. All channels must always be decontaminated.
Recommendation
▸ Thorough cleaning, brushing and flushing of all accessible
channels with enzymatic or low foaming detergent remains
the most important initial stage of the cleaning process.
(Grade D)
Poor cleaning and dismantling of suction valves can harbour
debris and can result in continuing contamination of mycobac￾teria and viruses.
Recommendations
▸ Single-use suction valves should replace reusable valves wher￾ever possible. Single-use valves must be discarded after each
procedure. (Grade D)
▸ Reusable valves should be used only with one bronchoscope
and stored alongside the scope for traceability. (Grade D)
The use of single-use accessories helps minimise the risk of
transmission of prions.
Recommendations
▸ Single-use accessories should be selected over reusable acces￾sories wherever possible. (Grade D)
▸ When it is necessary to use reusable accessories they must be
cleaned according to manufacturer’s recommendations.
(Grade D)
▸ Tracking of patient use of equipment and cleaning processes
must be completed after each use. (Grade D)
Chemical disinfectants are often toxic to the skin, mucous
membranes and/or by vapour inhalation. Exposure of staff is
regulated by COSHH guidance. Gluteraldehyde has been identi￾fied as the fifth highest cause of occupational asthma, therefore
reduction of its use is recommended in favour of newer, less
hazardous substances.287 There are a number of disinfectants
available. The Health and Safety Executive 288 offers advice on
suitable alternatives.
Recommendations
▸ On the grounds of staff safety, manual disinfection is no
longer recommended. (Grade D)
▸ Bronchoscopes should be processed in AERs. (Grade D)
▸ Aldehyde-based disinfectants are no longer recommended.
(Grade C)
▸ Alternative, recommended disinfectants should be used in
accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. (Grade D)
The choice of disinfectant will depend on compatibility with
bronchoscopes and AER brand and advice should be sought
from the manufacturer. Disinfectants should be used according
to the manufacturer’s instructions as they differ in recom￾mended exposure time, temperature, dilution etc. The material
safety data sheet must be obtained to ensure precautions are fol￾lowed if applicable.
Recommendations
▸ Disinfectant times should be those recommended by disin￾fectant manufacturers. (Grade D)
▸ Universal decontamination procedures should be performed
before and after all procedures to avoid transmission of HIV.
(Grade D)
▸ The use of 70% alcohol after final rinse is no longer recom￾mended as it is considered to act as a fixative. (Grade D)
Good practice points
▸ Compatibility of bronchoscopes with disinfectant and AER
manufacturers’ instructions should be checked. (√)
▸ A record of which bronchoscope and other reusable equip￾ment are used on an individual patient should be kept and
also of the decontamination procedure. (√)
▸ There is currently no known decontamination method that
prevents transmission of vCJD. Record keeping and identifi￾cation of high-risk cases are advised. (√)
Purpose built drying cabinets and storage chambers are now
available. These devices deliver particulate filtered air through
the scope channels at individual instrument appropriate tem￾peratures and flow rates. Manufacturers claim they have been
shown to prevent colonisation for up to 72 h or longer; their
use would negate the need for bronchoscopes to undergo the
decontamination cycle at the beginning of a list.
Recommendations
▸ Drying cabinets/storage chambers are recommended for
storing clean bronchoscopes. Compatibility of bronchoscopes
must be confirmed with individual instrument manufacturers.
(Grade D)
▸ Bronchoscopes stored in drying cabinets or storage chambers
should be reprocessed in accordance with the manufacturer’s
recommendations. (Grade D)
Bronchoscopes require storing in a manner that keeps them
free from contamination from other instruments and environ￾mental organisms. Moisture can accumulate around suction
valves and ports if valves are left in situ during storage.
Recommendations
▸ When drying cabinets or storage chambers are not available,
bronchoscopes must be stored in a hanging position, with
sufficient space between instruments to avoid cross contamin￾ation. (Grade D)
▸ Valves must not be attached to bronchoscopes during
storage. (Grade D)
▸ Bronchoscopes must be cleaned and disinfected before and
after placing in carrying cases as these cases cannot be disin￾fected. Bronchoscopes should not be stored in carrying cases.
(Grade D)
Mycobacteria (and subspecies), fungi, bacteria, including
Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Legionella pneumophilia, have all
been isolated from bronchoscope washings. Poor cleaning,
storing of bronchoscopes and suction valves and contaminated
tap water and AERs have all been identified as sources of
contamination.
Recommendation
▸ A record must be kept of each bronchoscope and reusable
accessory used on each individual patient. Tracking each step
of the decontamination cycle and personnel involved should
also be recorded. This will facilitate tracing if an increase in
contamination by organisms is identified among bronchos￾copy patients. (Grade D)
AER’s are the recommended method of disinfecting broncho￾scopes, but have been shown to be a potential source of

infection. Validation and quality control are essential for ensur￾ing bronchoscopes are not being contaminated with organisms
during the disinfection cycle. Guidance is provided in
HTM-2030 (http://www.environmentalwatersystems.co.uk/
HTM2030.htm) and from individual hospital authorised
persons. The use of mains water of inappropriate quality can
also be a contributory factor to the contamination of the
machine and the endoscope.
Recommendations
▸ AERs should be self-disinfected at the beginning of each day.
(Grade D)
▸ AERs must be validated on instillation and following intro￾duction of new disinfectants according to HTM-01.
(Grade D)
▸ Sterile water or filtered water should be used for the final
rinse. Tap water is not recommended. (Grade D)
▸ Regular testing of AERs and final rinse water for mycobac￾teria must be carried out according to HTM-01. (Grade D)
STAFF SAFETY
Disinfectants can be hazardous to staff, they can produce irritat￾ing and sensitising vapours. Toxic effects include severe derma￾titis, conjunctivitis, sinusitis and asthma.
To comply with the Health and Safety Act (1974) a detailed
COSHH risk assessment must be completed and should include
staff health surveillance, adequate personal protective equip￾ment and ventilation control. A policy and equipment for
dealing with spillages or disposal of disinfectants must be avail￾able. The ‘Decontamination standards for flexible endoscopes
2008’ document contains detailed information regarding safety
issues, including staff safety.283
When handling disinfectants full personal protective equip￾ment should be worn, including full face visors and long nitrile
gloves to protect against splashes. Charcoal impregnated face￾masks will protect against disinfectant vapours. Wounds and
abrasions should be covered. Sealed or exhaust ventilation facil￾ities are required to protect staff from exposure to hazardous
substances such as disinfectants.
Recommendations
▸ Open troughs of disinfectant are not recommended.
(Grade D)
▸ Staff handling disinfectants should always wear full personal
protective equipment in line with COSHH risk assessment.
(Grade D)
▸ Medical histories of staff should be recorded including pre￾existing asthma, skin and mucosal sensitivities. (Grade D)
▸ Pre-employment baseline lung function, such as spirometry,
should be measured and recorded. (Grade D)
▸ Annual lung function measurements, such as spirometry,
should be performed on all personnel directly exposed to
disinfectants. (Grade D)
Bronchoscopy personnel are potentially at risk of transmis￾sion of infections such as mycobacteria. Cough-inducing pro￾cedures such as bronchoscopy pose a risk to staff from
airborne mycobacteria TB. Full personal protective equipment
protects staff from airborne contaminants and contaminated
secretions.
There is also a potential risk to bronchoscopy personnel of
blood-borne infections such as hepatitis B and HIV. Needle stick
injuries can occur during re-sheathing of needles or removal of
tissue from biopsy forceps. Hypodermic needles should not be
used for removing tissue from forceps.
Recommendations
▸ Immunisation against hepatitis B and TB should be con￾firmed in all bronchoscopy personnel before employment.
Vaccinations should be offered if necessary. (Grade D)
▸ Hypodermic needles or other sharp instruments should not
be used to remove tissue samples from biopsy forceps.
Blunt-ended needles or sterile plastic toothpicks are prefer￾able. (Grade D)
▸ Reusable spiked forceps are not recommended. (Grade D)
Good practice point
▸ In patients with suspected TB, bronchoscopy should be per￾formed in an appropriately engineered and ventilated area,
and the bronchoscopy team should use adequate protection,
including masks. (√)
Nursing skill mix and staffing levels
There is limited evidence available regarding skill mix and
nurse staffing levels required during bronchoscopy procedures
(www.nrls.npsa.nhs.uk/resources/?entryid45=59896NPSA/2008/
RRR011). National Patient Safety Alert RRR011 (2008), con￾cerning administration of sedatives during procedures such as
bronchoscopy, must be considered when assessing nurse skill mix
and staffing levels. The BSG guidelines (2001)289 have made
recommendations for two service models for endoscopy proce￾dures with the recommendation that levels increase when more
than one procedure room is available.
Patients require very careful monitoring of sedation levels
during the procedure and throughout the recovery phase. This
requires knowledge and experience of the effects and adverse
effects of the sedatives and the ability to administer drugs when
required.
Recommendations
▸ A minimum of two qualified nurses are required during
bronchoscopy procedures: one assistant nurse and another
dedicated to monitoring patients response to the medication
and procedure. (Grade D)
▸ A qualified nurse is required to recover a patient after bron￾choscopy. (Grade D)
▸ Advanced procedures may require additional staff. (Grade D)
Numbers of ancillary staff, for support and cleaning of equip￾ment, may vary according to location and cleaning methods of
bronchoscopes.
PATIENT SATISFACTION
FB is necessary for the diagnosis and endobronchial treatment
of respiratory disease. Many patients are fearful of the proced￾ure and experience anxiety prior to and discomfort during the
bronchoscopy, irrespective of sedation and analgesia.290 291
Increasingly emphasis is placed on patient satisfaction as an
outcome measure for bronchoscopy, along with the diagnostic
and therapeutic value of the procedure.292
Patient satisfaction is complex and influenced by multiple
factors, measured in varied ways, and needs to be interpreted in
the context of the specific procedure evaluated. Multiple factors
appear to influence patient satisfaction when assessed for FB.
Patient characteristics, previous healthcare experience, expecta￾tions, the procedure and post-procedure care all play a role in
determining how satisfied a patient is following a FB. Patient’s
willingness to return for another bronchoscopy,292 visual ana￾logue scoring (VAS) systems, adherence to post-procedure
instructions and recorded numbers of complaints and medical

negligence claims are mentioned as indicators of satisfaction in
bronchoscopy.
Determining factors for patient satisfaction with bronchos￾copy can be divided into patient characteristics, process or
procedure factors and factors associated with the setting.
Lechtzin et al292 found that patients more willing to return
for a repeat bronchoscopy had a better general health status,
experienced less pain with bronchoscope insertion, rated the
information given to them better and rated the quality of the
bronchoscopist higher. Hirose et al293 found that male
gender, shorter examination time, more experienced bronch￾oscopist and less discomfort from coughing, pharyngeal pain
and swallowing were associated with higher patient satisfac￾tion. VAS for cough perception during a FB appear to correl￾ate best with patient satisfaction in one study.294 This study
further demonstrates a positive correlation between VAS for
satisfaction as reported by the bronchoscopist and the
patient and the total number of coughs recorded during
the procedure. Bernasconi et al reported the length of
the procedure as an important determining factor for satisfac￾tion, irrespective of procedures performed during the
bronchoscopy.295
Many patients undergoing a bronchoscopy are fearful of a
malignant diagnosis and are anxious prior to the procedure.
The discomfort experienced by patients during bronchoscopy
strongly correlates to anxiety before the procedure.295 296
Adequate sedation reduces patient anxiety and improves toler￾ance and satisfaction with the procedure.98 Detailed pre￾procedure information explaining ‘how’ the procedure will be
done and ‘why’ it is indicated helps to reduce pre-procedure
fear in patients290 (appendix 13 provides an example of a
patient information leaflet that is also available electronically on
the BTS website).
Distraction methods have been used to reduce patients’ levels
of fear and anxiety prior to bronchoscopy. Distraction therapy
with nature sounds and sights improved self-reported anxiety in
a randomised trial done by Diette et al.
297 Two randomised
trials using music to reduce stress in patients failed to demon￾strate a difference in physiological responses during the proced￾ure298 or procedure-related anxiety state scores.299
There is insufficient evidence to support a specific time for
patients to starve prior to bronchoscopy. A Cochrane review and
recent systematic review on fasting times for surgery found no
evidence that participants given fluids 2–3 h preoperatively were
at an increased risk of aspiration/regurgitation.300 301 The 2001
guideline recommended fasting time for solids of 4 h and clear
fluids up to 2 h.2 No new evidence was found of increased
adverse events with this regime or evidence to support longer
fasting times for FB.
Patient satisfaction is complex and influenced by multiple
factors; it is increasingly recognised that measuring the patient
experience in a specific setting is important to improve and
transform services. The Department of Health in the UK pub￾lished a document on best practice in 2009 entitled
‘Understanding what matters: a guide to using patient feedback
to transform care’.
302 In this document the importance of
patient involvement in developing and changing healthcare ser￾vices is emphasised. The process of collecting and reviewing
patient experience feedback is important in how healthcare ser￾vices are delivered.302 The benefits of including patient feedback
in review of FB services include:
▸ improvement in communication between patients and staff;
▸ building trust and confidence in the healthcare provider and
service;
▸ informs planning and service improvement;
▸ patient-centred, accessible and responsive services;
▸ patients help to shape the services that they use.
Evidence statements
▸ Patient satisfaction is determined by multiple factors and
depends on patient specific factors, the procedure, the
setting, information given prior to the procedure,
sedation used and post-procedure management. (Evidence
level 3)
▸ Verbal and written information given prior to FB, explaining
the indications and what the patient can expect during the
procedure, improve patient tolerance and satisfaction.
(Evidence level 3)
▸ Patients offered sedation during FB tolerate the procedure
better and are less likely to have a failed procedure.
(Evidence level 2)
Recommendations
▸ Verbal and written patient information explaining indications
and what to expect during the procedure, and potential com￾plications should be provided to improve patient tolerance.
(Grade C)
▸ Patients should be offered sedation during FB to improve
patient tolerance. (Grade B)
▸ It is sufficient for patients to have no food by mouth for 4 h
and to allow clear fluids by mouth up to 2 h before bron￾choscopy. (Grade D)
Good practice point
▸ Patients who had sedation should be advised not to drive,
sign legally binding documents or operate machinery for
24 h after the procedure (√)
CONSENT
Patients have a right to information about their condition and
the treatment options open to them and practitioners should be
satisfied that they have consent from a patient, or other valid
authority, before undertaking FB. Giving and obtaining consent
is usually a process, not a one-off event. Patients need time to
read and understand the information provided before FB and
should be given the opportunity to ask questions. Patients can
change their minds and withdraw consent at any time. To
proceed with bronchoscopy in the absence of appropriate
consent may lead to legal proceedings for assault and battery.
Failure to provide adequate information to a patient, including
information about the potential risks and adverse outcomes of a
procedure, may lead to a negligence action against the clinician.
In the UK, the principles and guidance for obtaining informed
consent is outlined by the General Medical Council in a docu￾ment entitled ‘Consent guidance: patients and doctors making
decisions together’.
303
Good practice point
▸ Practitioners undertaking FB should be familiar with, and
adhere to the national and local guidance for obtaining
informed consent. (√)
The practitioner undertaking the bronchoscopy or responsible
for the trainee doing the bronchoscopy is responsible for ensur￾ing valid consent was obtained prior to the procedure. If it is
not practical for this clinician to discuss the procedure with the
patient, the responsibility can be delegated to someone else,
provided the person the task is delegated to:
▸ has been suitably trained and is qualified;
▸ has sufficient knowledge of the proposed procedure and/or
treatment to understand and discuss the risks involved with
the patient;

▸ has a good understanding, and agrees to act in accordance
with national and local guidance on obtaining informed
consent.
The patient should be provided with timely and sufficient
information about the proposed FB before the procedure
date. The exchange of information between the clinician and
the patient is central to the process of informed consent and
good decision-making. The amount of information shared
with patients will vary, depending on their individual circum￾stances. The approach to discussions with patients should be
tailored to:
▸ the patient’s individual needs, wishes and priorities;
▸ the patient’s unique level of understanding and knowledge of
their condition, prognosis and the treatment options;
▸ the nature of the condition that the bronchoscopy is indi￾cated for;
▸ the nature and level of risk associated with the proposed
procedure.
Patients should be given the opportunity to ask any ques￾tions and practitioners must answer all questions honesty and
truthfully. Care should be taken not to make any assumptions
about the amount of information the patient may need or
want or the patient’s knowledge or understanding of the
proposed procedure. A suggested patient information leaflet
accompanies this guideline in appendix 13.
CONCLUSION
FB is an essential, established and ever expanding tool in
respiratory medicine. Its practice, however, needs to be safe,
effective and for the right indications.
This guideline seeks to provide a detailed, evidence-based and
practical overview of best practice in this field. Extensive litera￾ture has been published in the various aspects of bronchoscopy
over the last three decades, and this document has been devel￾oped by carefully appraising all the available publications, apply￾ing a rigorous, standardised methodology, and summarising the
wealth of data that are available.
Particular emphasis has been placed on the safety aspects
of bronchoscopy, such as patient monitoring, precautions in
specific conditions, prevention and management of complica￾tions, adequate staffing, optimal sedation and disinfection. At
the same time, the importance of continually auditing the
practice of this indispensable technique, with the aim of
achieving and maintaining the high diagnostic utility that it
offers is outlined.
The primary objective of this guideline is to provide practi￾tioners in the UK and beyond with a comprehensive guide to
the technique of basic FB, using up-to-date information. For
information on more advanced bronchoscopic procedures, this
document is best read in conjunction with the BTS guideline for
advanced diagnostic and therapeutic bronchoscopy, published in
November 2011.3

APPENDIX 5: FLEXIBLE BRONCHOSCOPY SAFETY CHECKLIST
Also available electronically on the BTS website
APPENDIX 6: MANAGEMENT APPROACH TO BLEEDING AT BRONCHOSCOPY
Major bleeding is uncommon following bronchoscopic biopsies but can complicate transbronchial lung biopsy or biopsy of some
endobronchial tumours.
General Approach:
1. Consider whether the biopsy is necessary.
Only a few diagnoses can be reliably made with TBLB, and sampling of nodal or extra thoracic disease in malignancy may be
more appropriate than endobronchial disease where staging information is required.
2. Does the patient have appropriate physiological reserve to withstand haemorrhage, and a secure patent airway
3. If bleeding is considered highly likely and biopsy urgent/ mandatory, ensure good IV access, commence supplemental oxygen,
apply prophylactic local vasoconstrictor therapy and achieve the best first biopsy possible. Where available, the use of argon
plasma coagulation or other similar haemostatic biopsy technique could be considered. Ensure senior advice/ assistance is avail￾able. As an alternative, consider a rigid bronchoscopic biopsy.
In the event of significant unexpected bleeding:
1. Ensure adequate oxygenation and IV access for fluid resuscitation. Vital signs should be monitored regularly.
2. Retract the bronchoscope proximally to maintain vision, and apply suction to remove free blood to preserve airway patency.
Consider lying patient onto the side of the bleeding. Do not suction to remove clot.
3. Consider the application of local vasoconstrictor therapy. Agents include 5-10ml 1:10000 epinephrine or 5-10ml 4°C saline.
Saline has the advantage that it may be administered repeatedly.
4. If bleeding continues, the bronchoscope should be wedged into the bleeding segmental bronchus, if possible, and held in place for
10-15 minutes.
5. If this does not control the bleeding, a balloon catheter can be used to apply pressure and isolate the segment.
6. Check platelet count, PT and PTT, and recheck drug history.
7. Seek senior/expert assistance, and consider referral to critical care.

enough to ensure that sedation and cardiorespiratory
depression does not recur once the effect of
flumazenil ceases. Further doses may be required.
Where combined sedation with midazolam and opioid
has been used, it is recommended that flumazenil is
administered first, unless a large dose of opioid has
been given
Naloxone To reverse opioids

Approximate half-life
▸ 1-1.5 hours
Nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headache,
tachycardia, hypo/hypertension. May cause
withdrawal in chronic opioid users.
Naloxone has a shorter duration of action than many
opioids, and so patients should be observed long
enough to ensure that sedation and cardiorespiratory
depression does not recur once its effect ceases.
Further doses may be required.

APPENDIX 10 BTS FLEXIBLE BRONCHOSCOPY - SUGGESTED GUIDES ON HOW TO PERFORM STANDARD PROCEDURES
BRONCHOALVEOLAR LAVAGE
This procedure is performed during flexible bronchoscopy and is useful in the diagnosis of pulmonary infections and may be useful in the diagnosis of parenchymal lung
disease.
The site of BAL should be guided by available radiology.
i. Once the site for BAL has been chosen, the bronchoscope should be advanced until the desired site is reached.
ii. The bronchoscope should then be wedged in to a position where the lumen of the bronchus is occluded by the bronchoscope
iii. Whilst the bronchoscope is in this position, 60-180mls of normal saline should be instilled in to the segment
iv. Low-pressure suction should then be applied to retrieve the sample. The aim should be to apply enough suction to retrieve the sample without causing airway collapse.
v. To ensure an adequate sample is retrieved it is useful to have tubing with several containers in series attached to the suction pump.
vi. Some centres employ a syringe to retrieve the sample from the same port that the saline is instilled through.
ENDOBRONCHIAL BIOPSY
This procedure is performed for visible airway abnormalities, most commonly in the diagnosis of suspected lung cancer. Once again, radiology should be available to plan
where sampling should occur. There are several types of biopsy forceps, most commonly alligator or open cup forceps are used. Studies have not demonstrated any
advantage of one type of forceps over the other in diagnostic yield.
i. The bronchoscope should be advanced until the endobronchial lesion is visualised.
ii. Secure the bronchoscope in this position so that the abnormality can be fully visualised, then advance the forceps in the closed position through the working channel
of the bronchoscope.
iii. Once the forceps are visualised at the distal end of the bronchoscope the forceps can be opened.
iv. Whilst keeping the bronchoscope still the forceps should be advanced in the open position towards the abnormality.
v. Once the target is reached the forceps should be closed trapping as much tissue as possible.
vi. The forceps should be retracted and removed from the working channel of the bronchoscope.
vii. A "tugging" sensation may be felt whilst retracting the forceps.
viii. Once the sample has been removed from the forceps, it should be reinserted into the working channel and the procedure repeated 5-6 times.
ENDOBRONCHIAL BRUSH
This procedure is performed to gain cytology samples in areas of abnormal mucosa or endobronchial lesions. Although no evidence exists for which procedure is performed
first we suggest that endobronchial biopsies are performed prior to brushings.
i. Once the area of abnormality is detected the bronchial brush is inserted through the working channel of the bronchoscope in its retracted position in its protective
sheath
ii. Once the bronchial brush is seen at the distal end of the bronchoscope the brush can be pushed out (opened)
iii. The brush is then advanced towards the lesion and moved back and forth over the lesion several times
iv. The brush is then retracted into its sheath (closed) and removed from the working channel
v. The procedure is repeated
TRANSBRONCHIAL LUNG BIOPSY
This procedure is performed via flexible bronchoscopy, to aid the diagnosis of parenchymal lung disease. Unlike endobronchial biopsy this procedure can be performed
"blind", without direct visualisation of the lesion. Some centres chose to perform this procedure with radiological guidance (fluoroscopy), diagnostic yield does not differ
between methods. Accurate radiological imaging is essential to guide the bronchoscopist to the lung parenchyma with the greatest potential diagnostic yield in non-diffuse
interstitial disease.
i. The bronchoscope is advanced as far as possible into the area of the lung to be biopsied
ii. The forceps are then inserted into the working channel and advanced as far as possible
iii. At this point the forceps are retracted 1 cm to avoid a biopsy of the pleura Instruct the patient to take a slow deep breath in. The forceps are then opened during
inspiration
iv. Instruct the patient to breathe out slowly, whilst the patient is breathing out the forceps are advanced and closed
v. The forceps are then removed and the sample retrievedWarning: Do not take the biopsy if the patient experience pain when forceps is pulled back or removed, pleura
could have been caught in the forceps. Open forceps and remove without biopsy.
vi. The procedure is repeated a further 5-6 timesClinical Tip: Whilst performing a TBLB co-operation of the patient is necessary. Patients should be able to follow
commands and light sedation is therefore advised.

APPENDIX 12: CLEANING AND DISINFECTING PROCEDURE
Wear appropriate, protective clothing
(Gloves, aprons, visors or goggles, face mask and forearm covers)
1 Before removing bronchoscope from light source or video processor suction with enzymatic detergent, followed by 10 seconds of air. This will remove blood, mucus and
debris from internal channels. Wipe the external surface of the scope with a soft lint free cloth soaked in detergent. Check scope for damage. Remove, flush and wipe
biopsy and suction ports. Discard single use valves.
2 Transport bronchoscope to the decontamination area in an appropriately sized and covered receptacle.
3 Leak test bronchoscope according to manufacturer’s recommendations.
4 Manual cleaning of bronchoscope to be performed in a dedicated sink filled with water and detergent according to manufacturer’s recommendations. Water and
detergent to be discarded after each use.
5 Brush suction and biopsy channels and ports with a single-use brush, according to manufacturer’s guidelines. Ensure the brush is visibly clean at the end of the process.
6 Clean the external surface of the scope, around the angulation control and distal tip of the bronchoscope.
7 Brush the biopsy and suction channel ports with a single-use short brush.
8 Irrigate the channels with an enzymatic detergent followed by water, then air.
9 Transfer the bronchoscope to a separate sink for rinsing, to remove residual detergent.
10 Transfer bronchoscope to AER in an appropriately sized receptacle.
11 Disinfect in Automated Endoscope Reprocessor alongside reusable valves. Ensure all channels are exposed to disinfectant process.
12 Store hanging in cupboard or drying cabinet following manufacturers recommendations.
13 Maintain record of decontamination process for bronchoscope and accessories.
