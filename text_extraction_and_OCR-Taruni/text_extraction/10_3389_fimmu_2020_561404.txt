Reflecting their importance in immunity, the activity of chemokines is regulated on
several levels, including tissue and context-specific expression and availability of their
cognate receptor on target cells. Chemokine synergism, affecting both chemokine and
chemokine receptor function, has emerged as an additional control mechanism. We
previously demonstrated that CXCL14 is a positive allosteric modulator of CXCR4
in its ability to synergize with CXCL12 in diverse cellular responses. Here, we have
extended our study to additional homeostatic, as well as a selection of inflammatory
chemokine systems. We report that CXCL14 strongly synergizes with low (sub￾active) concentrations of CXCL13 and CCL19/CCL21 in in vitro chemotaxis with
immune cells expressing the corresponding receptors CXCR5 and CCR7, respectively.
CXCL14 by itself was inactive, not only on cells expressing CXCR5 or CCR7
but also on cells expressing any other known conventional or atypical chemokine
receptor, as assessed by chemotaxis and/or β-arrestin recruitment assays. Furthermore,
synergistic migration responses between CXCL14 and inflammatory chemokines
CXCL10/CXCL11 and CCL5, targeting CXCR3 and CCR5, respectively, were marginal
and occasional synergistic Ca2+ flux responses were observed. CXCL14 bound to 300-
19 cells and interfered with CCL19 binding to CCR7-expressing cells, suggesting that
these cellular interactions contributed to the reported CXCL14-mediated synergistic
activities. We propose a model whereby tissue-expressed CXCL14 contributes to
cell localization under steady-state conditions at sites with prominent expression of
homeostatic chemokines.

INTRODUCTION
CXCL14 is one of the least understood chemokines, featuring remarkable amino acid sequence
conservation across a wide range of species and constitutive expression in border-lining tissues
by epithelial cells, fibroblasts and macrophages (1). The study of target cells for CXCL14, and
hence its role in physiological and pathophysiological processes, has been hampered by the lack

Kouzeli et al. CXCL14 Synergizes With Homeostatic Chemokines
of identification of its receptor. Nevertheless, in accordance
with the definition of chemokines, CXCL14 was shown to
be a chemoattractant for a subset of human immune cells,
including blood monocytes, immature DCs and NK cells but not
lymphocytes, which do not migrate in response to CXCL14 (2–
6). Induction of Ca2+ mobilization and sensitivity to Bordetella
pertussis toxin treatment in monocytes suggests that the elusive
CXCL14 receptor is a prototypical chemokine receptor that
requires Gα i-type G-proteins for signaling (3). CXCL14 does not
belong to the subset of chemokines whose expression is induced
only under inflammatory conditions. In fact, inflammatory
stimuli (LPS, TNF-α, ROS) and growth factors (VEGF, EGF) that
signal through the MEK/ERK pathway were shown to inhibit the
constitutive expression of CXCL14 (7–10), an effect frequently
linked with epigenetic silencing (8, 11–14). Positive modulators
of CXCL14 expression are less clear and vary depending on the
cellular context (15–17).
Mutant mice lacking CXCL14 do not show aberrant
numbers or tissue distribution of immune cells but suffer
from developmental and/or metabolic defects, as evidenced by
decreased survival rate of neonates, reduced body weight of
adults and defects in glucose metabolism (18–21). These findings
suggest subtle involvement of CXCL14 in steady-state processes
that may go beyond the control of immunity. A large body of
literature discusses the pro-and anti-tumor effects of CXCL14
[reviewed in Yang et al. (22)]. The tumor-suppressor activity
of CXCL14 is more widely documented, with loss of CXCL14
expression by epigenetic silencing coinciding with tumor
progression (8, 12–14). Conversely, stromal cell-derived CXCL14
was frequently shown to promote tumor growth via diverse
mechanisms, including epithelial to mesenchymal transition,
coupled with tumor cell metastasis as well as indirect support
of angiogenesis and tumor growth (22). The effect of CXCL14
on fibroblasts is noteworthy, as CXCL14 induced a fibrosis gene
expression profile, linking this chemokine with lung disease (23–
25), whereas stimulation of tumor-associated fibroblasts with
CXCL14 led to the generation of tumor-promoting factors (26–
28). Collectively, mounting evidence supports a role for CXCL14
in controlling the activity and functions of certain tissue cell
types, in addition to circulating immune cells, in the context of
health and disease. This warrants an extensive investigation into
the relationships and interactions that occur between CXCL14
and other chemokine family members.
We have previously reported that CXCL14 acts as a positive
allosteric modulator of CXCR4 during synergistic cell responses
with CXCL12 (29). CXCL14 by itself was inactive yet, in
combination with low CXCL12 concentrations, induced strong
chemotactic responses in CXCR4-expressing cells. Synergism
with CXCL14 required the presence of CXCR4 whose cell
surface aggregation was promoted by CXCL14 binding. In
the present study we have asked the question whether the
observed CXCL14 synergism is restricted to CXCL12 and
its receptor CXCR4 by examining other, CXCR4-unrelated,
homeostatic and inflammatory chemokine systems. We report
that CXCL14 did not activate any of the known classical or
atypical chemokine receptors but exhibited synergistic responses
with the homeostatic chemokines CXCL13, CCL19 and CCL21
in inducing the chemotactic migration of cells expressing the
corresponding chemokine receptors CXCR5 and CCR7. We
further report that synergism of CXCL14 with inflammatory
chemokines was much less obvious. We discuss our novel
findings on the basis of the site-specific co-expression of CXCL14
and its synergizing homeostatic chemokines CXCL12, CXCL13,
CCL19 and CCL21, and discuss models of pleiotropic chemokine
co-operation in epithelial tissues.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemokines and Other Reagents
Synthetic chemokines (CXCL14, CCL19, CCL21, CXCL13,
CCL5, CXCL10 and CXCL11) were chemically synthezised,
as previously described (30). CCL19Dy69P1 was produced as
previously described (31, 32). Human CXCL14 conjugated to
the fluorochrome Alexa Fluor 647 attached to a C-terminal
lysine residue was purchased from Almac Sciences (Edinburgh,
United Kingdom).
Isolation of Primary Human Cells
All research involving work with human venous blood samples
was approved by the local research ethics commission and
informed consent was obtained from each participant. Peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from the
heparinized blood of healthy volunteers by centrifugation over a
Lymphoprep (Axis Shield, Dundee, United Kingdom) gradient.
Total CD3+ T cells were isolated from PBMC using a Pan￾T cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Bisley, United Kingdom),
according to manufacturer’s instructions.
In vitro Cell Cultures
Primary cell cultures were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium
that was supplemented with 10% (v/v) foetal calf serum (FCS),
2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 1% (v/v) non￾essential amino acids, and 50 µg/ml penicillin/streptomycin
(cRPMI; all from Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA,
United States). Murine pre-B cell line 300-19 was cultured
in the same medium that was supplemented with 50 µM 2-
mercaptoethanol (2-ME;Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1.5 µg/ml
puromycin for selection. Human embryonic kidney (HEK293T)
cells were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with
10% (v/v) FCS, 1% non-essential amino acids and 50 µg/ml
penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were maintained in a humidified
incubator at 37◦C and a mixture of 95% air, 5% CO2. 300-19
cells have been stably transfected and routinely used by our group
and others (33). Parental (untransfected) and 300-19 cells that
were stably transfected with various chemokine receptors were
maintained at a cell density not exceeding 2 × 106
cells/ml. All
cell lines were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination by
RT-PCR.
Transwell Chemotaxis Assay
Chemokines were resuspended in chemotaxis buffer [plain
RPMI-1640 containing 1% pasteurized plasma protein solution
(5% PPL SRK; SwissRed Cross Laboratory, Bern, Switzerland)

Kouzeli et al. CXCL14 Synergizes With Homeostatic Chemokines
and 20 mM HEPES (Thermo Fisher Scientific)] to the desired
concentration and 235 µl was placed in the lower chamber of
Transwell 96-well plates (4.26 mm, 5.0 µm pore; Corning, St.
David’s Park, United Kingdom). A well containing chemotaxis
buffer with no chemokine (buffer only control) was used as a
negative control. Polycarbonate filters were placed in the wells
and the plate was allowed to equilibrate at 37◦C. PBMC or 300-
19 cells were resuspended in prewarmed chemotaxis buffer at
2 × 106
cells/ml. Cells were allowed to rest for 30 min at 37◦C
before the assay. Cells (160,000 in 80 µl) were placed in the upper
well of the Transwell and the plate was incubated at 37◦C for 2–
5 h. Upon termination of the assay, migrated cells were collected
from the lower chamber and transferred to 96-well plates for
staining. Following staining, cells were resuspended in 75 µl PBS
containing 2% FCS + 0.02% sodium azide (FACS buffer). Accu￾Check (25 µl) counting beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were
added to each sample to enable accurate cell counts determined
by flow cytometry. Cell migration data were expressed either by
a percentage of total input cells or a migration index, which is
defined as the number of cells migrated toward a chemokine
divided by the number of cells migrated in response to buffer
(buffer only control).
Flow Cytometry
Single cell suspensions were incubated with Fixable Aqua Dead
Cell Stain Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to allow exclusion
of dead cells. Following blocking of endogenous Fc receptors,
cells were incubated with fluorochrome-conjugated mAbs against
the following human cell-surface markers (conjugate and clone
indicated in brackets): CD3 (APC-H7, SK7), CCR7 (PECy7,
3D12), CCR5 (PE, 2D7), CD4 (BV421, RPA-T4; BD Biosciences,
Oxford, United Kingdom); CD19 (APC, SJ25C1, eBioscience,
Hatfield, United Kingdom); CXCR3 (FITC, 498801.111; R&D,
Minneapolis, MN, United States). Staining with mAbs was
performed in FACS buffer for 30 min at 4◦C. Isotype and
Fluorescence-Minus-One controls were used as appropriate.
Sample acquisition was performed by using a FACS Canto II
instrument (BD Biosciences). Cell aggregates were excluded
based on light scatter properties. Data was analyzed using FlowJo
software (Version 10.4, TreeStar, Ashland, OR, United States).
Ca2+ Mobilization Assay
Chemokine receptor-transfected pre-B 300-19 cells
(10 × 106
cells/ml) in cRPMI were treated with 2.5 µM
Fura-2-AM (HelloBio, Bristol, United Kingdom), 0.01%
(w/v) Pluronic-F127, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and
125 µM Probenecid solution (Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham,
United Kingdom) for 30 min at room temperature. Cells
were washed twice with cRPMI and resuspended in pH
7.0 Ca2+ buffer (Hanks Balanced Salt Solution [HBSS;
Invitrogen]) containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ and complemented
with 10 mM HEPES (Gibco) and 0.1% (v/v) FCS enriched
with 125 µM Probenecid, while being kept on ice. Cells were
resuspended in Ca2+ buffer supplemented with Probenecid
at final concentrations of 106
cells/ml. A spectrophotometer
(Fluorescence Spectrophotometer F-7000, Hitachi, Japan)
was used to measure fluorescence and intracellular Ca2+
concentrations ([Ca2+]i) were calculated using the Grynkiewicz
equation (34). For each individual measurement, 900,000 cells
were preheated for 10 min at 30◦C prior to stimulation with a
chemokine. Chemokine was injected after 100 s of recording
and recording continued up to 300 s. Rmax and Rmin values were
determined by treatment of cells with 50 µM digitonin and
10 mM EGTA (Sigma-Aldrich), respectively, in 20 mM Tris (pH
8.5; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany).
Chemokine Competition Assay
For chemokine competition assays, 2.5 × 105
300-19 pre-B cells
stably expressing CCR7-eGFP in staining buffer (145 mM NaCl,
5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM sodium phosphate,
5 mM HEPES; pH 7.5) were incubated with 25 nM fluorescently
labeled human CCL19 conjugated to Dy649P1 (Dyomics,
Jena, Germany) in the presence of graded concentrations of
unlabeled human CXCL14 or CCL19 at 37◦C for 60 min. Cells
were washed and analyzed on a LSRII flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA, United States) recording eGFP and
chemokine fluorescence. Flow cytometry data were evaluated
with FlowJo V10 and displayed using GraphPad Prism 8.0
(GraphPad, San Diego, CA, United States). IC50 values were
calculated by three parametric non-linear regression for agonist
concentration over response.
β-Arrestin Assay
β-arrestin recruitment to chemokine receptors in response
to CCL19, CXCL14 or positive control chemokines was
monitored by NanoLuc complementation assay [NanoBiT,
Promega, Madison, WI, United States (35)] as previously
described (36). In brief, 6.5 × 105 HEK293T cells were plated per
well in a 12-well dish (6 × 106 per 10 cm dish for concentration
response curves) and 24 h later co-transfected with pNBe vectors
encoding a chemokine receptor C-terminally tagged to the
luciferase fragment SmBiT and human β-arrestin-2 N-terminally
fused to LgBiT. 24 h post-transfection cells were harvested,
incubated for 25 min at 37◦C with Nano-Glo Live Cell substrate
diluted 200-fold and distributed into white 96-well plates
(1 × 105
cells per well). Ligand-induced, β-arrestin recruitment
to chemokine receptors was evaluated with a Mithras LB940
luminometer (Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany)
for 20 min. For concentration-response curves, 3 nM CCL19
was co-incubated with increasing concentrations of CXCL14 for
15 min at room temperature before treatment. For screening
experiments, 200 nM of one known agonist chemokine listed in
the IUPHAR repository of chemokine receptor ligands was added
as positive control to each receptor.
Statistical Analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism
version 8 for macOS (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA,
United States). All data are expressed as mean values and error
bars represent the SD or SEM. The D’Agostino-Pearson omnibus
normality test was carried out to determine normality of the
data. Friedman test followed by Dunn’s multiple comparison
test, Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test or Holm-Sidak
test were used to assess significance of differences in paired

RESULTS
CXCL14 Synergizes With the CCR7
Ligands CCL19 and CCL21
In its role as a positive allosteric modulator, CXCL14 synergizes
with CXCL12 by direct binding to CXCR4, without inducing
CXCR4-mediated signaling in the absence of CXCL12
(29). To expand our CXCL14 synergy studies to other
chemokine/chemokine receptor systems, we examined all known
human chemokine and atypical chemokine receptors in a global
screen involving β-arrestin recruitment as a functional read-out
(36, 37). β-arrestin recruitment is an early cellular response
to chemokines, requires prior phosphorylation of chemokine
receptors by G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) kinases and
results in receptor internalization. As shown in Figure 1A,
300 nM of synthetic or recombinant (not shown) CXCL14 did
not induce β-arrestin-2 recruitment to CXCR1-CXCR6, CCR1-
CCR10, XCR1, CX3CR1 or ACKR1-ACKR4, suggesting that
none is a functional receptor for CXCL14. As positive control,
cognate ligands at 200 nM showed the expected responses,
including ACKR2-ACKR4, which are known to scavenge
chemokines via receptor desensitization and internalization.
Identical results were obtained in the β-arrestin-1 recruitment
assay (not shown), i.e., 300 nM CXCL14 did not induce a
response with any of the listed receptors. Lack of β-arrestin
recruitment does not exclude the possibility of CXCL14 binding,
which enables CXCL14 to act as positive allosteric modulator
for CXCR4 (29). We applied the β-arrestin recruitment assay to
the study of CXCL14 synergism. Interestingly, strong synergism
was observed with 3 nM CCL19 in combination with increasing
concentrations of CXCL14, reaching >70% of maximal β-arrestin
responses seen at the highest concentrations of CCL19 when
tested alone (Figure 1B). CXCL14 on its own was completely
inactive throughout the concentration range tested. These results
demonstrate that CXCL14 synergism is not restricted to CXCR4
and its ligand CXCL12.
Next, we decided to further investigate the potential synergism
between CXCL14 and CCR7 ligands by studying chemotaxis, the
prototypical cellular response to chemokines. CCR7 is expressed
on naive and central memory (TCM) cells, which together make
up approximately two-thirds of all T cells present in PBMC
(Figure 2A). CCL19 and CCL21, the two selective chemokines for
CCR7, induced typical bell-shaped migration responses in T cells
with maximal responses seen at 100 nM of CCL19 (Figure 2B)
or CCL21 (Supplementary Figure S1), whereas CXCL14 up to
1,000 nM was completely inactive (Figure 2C). However, CCL19
at two submaximal concentrations, 1 or 10 nM, resulted in
strong synergistic responses when combined with 300–1,000 nM
CXCL14. Maximal synergism was consistently observed at
300 nM CXCL14 and declined at 1,000 nM CXCL14, resembling
bi-modal response curves typically seen with chemokines. To
compensate for substantial inter-experimental variations with
PBMC from various blood donors, paired values of chemotactic
indices for each experiment are shown in a line-plot. More
importantly, and with only a single exception, 300 nM CXCL14
consistently induced synergistic cell migration, irrespective of
the type or concentration of CCR7 ligand used. These robust
synergistic responses were replicated in CCR7-transfected 300-
19 pre-B cells (Figures 2D–F). The chemotaxis data generated
with 300-19-CCR7 cells were presented as net migration in
percentage of total input cells. Again, strong synergistic responses
were seen with CXCL14 in combination with 1 or 10 nM
CCL19 and maximal responses were consistently obtained in
combination with 100–1,000 nM CXCL14. In line with primary
T cells from PBMC, CCL19 induced maximal responses at
100 nM and maximal synergistic responses were observed with
300 nM CXCL14 in combination with 1 or 10 nM CCL19.
Again, CXCL14 on its own was inactive. These findings were fully
replicated with CCL21, the second ligand for CCR7, i.e., strong

synergistic responses were again observed with 300 nM CXCL14
in combination with 1 or 10 nM CCL21, both with primary T cells
and 300-19-CCR7 cells (Supplementary Figure S1).
Finally, in analogy to our previous study (29), we extended our
investigations to Ca2+-mobilization, which is a fast and transient
signaling event induced upon binding of chemokines to their
receptors (38, 39). This highly sensitive assay reveals Ca2+ signals
at chemokine concentrations well below those needed for cell
migration, as demonstrated with CCL19 and CCL21 in 300-19-
CCR7 cells (Figure 2G and Supplementary Figure S1E). 300 nM
CXCL14 on its own was inactive yet in combination with 0.1 or
1 nM CCL19 or CCL21 generated synergistic Ca2+-responses,
indicating that CXCL14 synergism extends to an early, Gα i-type
G-protein-mediated signaling event. We conclude that CXCL14
is a highly potent synergistic chemokine in combination with
CCL19 or CCL21 and CCR7-expressing target cells.
We questioned whether CXCL14 was able to interact with
CCR7-expressing cells and, in addition, to interfere with the
interaction between CCL19 and CCR7. First, we carried out
competition experiments at 37◦C with 300-19-CCR7 cells in
combination with a fixed concentration of fluorescently labeled
CCL19 (CCL19Dy649P1) that fully retained its biological activity
(32) and increasing concentrations of competing ligands, either
unlabeled CCL19 or CXCL14. Parental 300-19 cells lacking
CCR7 were used to determine the level of background staining.
The data clearly show a significant yet partial reduction in

CCL19Dy649P1 fluorescence at high CXCL14 concentrations
reaching 50 ± 6% at 500 nM CXCL14 (Figure 3A). However,
reduction of the incubation temperature to 10◦C, which prevents
CCR7 internalization, neutralized this effect, suggesting that
CXCL14 interfered with receptor internalization rather than
CCL19 binding to CCR7. In addition, using 300-19-CCR7 and
parental 300-19 cells at 10◦C together with Alexafluor-647
labeled CXCL14 (AF647-CXCL14; which retained full biological
activity), we show that CXCL14 was unable to bind specifically
to CCR7 (Figure 3B). Of note, the observed level of CXCL14
binding to 300-19 was comparable to the level of specific
CCL19 binding to CCR7. These findings fully agree with our
previous report of AF647-CXCL14 binding to CXCR4 expressed
on 300-19 cells, which was undetectable by flow cytometry
(29). In this study, specific interaction with CXCR4 was only
observed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy
using sensor chips coated with CXCR4-expressing lentivirus￾like particles. Unfortunately, lack of corresponding reagents

CXCL14 Synergism Extends to Additional
Homeostatic Chemokine Systems
Based on our results with CXCR4 (29) and CCR7 (shown
above), we speculated that the synergism of CXCL14 extends
to other chemokine/chemokine receptor systems involved in
homeostatic immune processes, such as CXCR5 and its single
ligand CXCL13. Indeed, studies with B cells from peripheral
blood (Figures 4A–C) and CXCR5-transfected 300-19 cells
(Figures 4D–F), which both express uniform and high levels of
CXCR5, revealed strong synergism with CXCL14. As previously
reported (40), CXCL13 is not a very potent chemokine
for CXCR5-expressing cells, showing maximal responses at
>100 nM, resembling the low potency of CXCL14 on human
blood monocytes (2, 3). CXCL14 on its own was inactive on
B cells. Interestingly, and in accordance with the low potency
of CXCL13, maximal synergistic responses were frequently
observed in combination with the highest CXCL14 concentration
(1,000 nM) tested, as opposed to our results with CXCR4
and CCR7 where 300 nM gave maximal synergistic responses.
Further, we have noticed that the synergistic responses with
primary B cells were relatively low, which may be due to using
unfractionated PBMC, containing numerous CXCR4/CCR7-high

Kouzeli et al. CXCL14 Synergizes With Homeostatic Chemokines
expressing leukocytes that might have interfered in this assay.
This potential problem was circumvented by using 300-19-
CXCR5 cells that uniformly express CXCR5 but lack human
CXCR4 and CCR7. Of note, 300-19 cells express low levels of
endogenous murine CXCR4, but it did not mediate responses
to CXCL12. Nevertheless, the representative results in Figure 4
demonstrate a strong synergism between CXCL14 and CXCL13
that clearly exceeded maximal 300-19-CXCR5 cell migration
responses to CXCL13 alone (Figure 4F). In addition, Ca2+-
mobilization curves were readily detected at low CXCL13
concentrations, again well below those required for induction of
cell migration. As expected, 300 nM CXCL14 alone was inactive,
yet induced small but detectable responses in combination with
0.1 and 1 nM CXCL13 (Figure 4G). We conclude that, indeed,
the potent synergistic function of CXCL14 includes all major
constitutive lymphoid tissue-homing chemokine systems.
CXCL14 Shows Weak Interactions With
Inflammatory Chemokine Systems
It is possible that the CXCL14 synergism is selective for
homeostatic chemokine systems, implying that similar synergistic
responses would not be seen with inflammatory chemokines. An
initial indication that this may be true stems from our earlier
studies demonstrating that CXCL14 was unable to synergize
with CCL2 and its receptor CCR2, an inflammatory chemokine
system involved in the recruitment of myeloid cells, including
blood monocytes, to inflamed tissues (29). Here, we extended
these studies to inflammatory chemokine systems controlling the
recruitment of effector T cells. First, we turned to CCL5 and one
of its receptors CCR5 that is prominently expressed on activated
Th1 cells (41). In this system we were unable to detect obvious
and consistent CXCL14-mediated synergism (Figure 5). CCR5
is expressed on a minor subset of T cells present in peripheral
blood and, therefore, we did not use fresh PBMC in our
chemotaxis assay. Instead, we used expanded T cell lines derived
from primary T cells that were stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28
beads and then cultured for 14–21 days in the presence of
IL-2 and IL-15. The majority of expanded T cells expressed
CCR5 (Figure 5A) and CXCR3 (see below) as well as various
combinations of other receptors for inflammatory chemokines.
In addition, to circumvent the potential problem posed by the co￾expression of multiple chemokine receptors, we also used 300-19-
CCR5 cells, showing uniform and selective expression of CCR5
(Figure 5D). Both readily migrated in response to CCL5 with
maximal migration seen at <100 nM whereas CXCL14 on its own
was inactive. Interestingly, as opposed to synergism, addition
of CXCL14 to suboptimal concentrations (0.01 and 0.1 nM) of
CCL5 inhibited chemotactic migration. Statistical significance
was not reached yet these observations were consistently made
with both primary and CCR5-transfected cell lines. Although
we do not know the underlying mechanism at present, inter￾experimental variation can be excluded since inhibition was
clearly evident in 4 out of 6 experiments at both concentrations
of CCL5 (Figure 5F). By contrast to inhibition of chemotaxis,
modest synergistic Ca2+ spikes were measured as evidenced in
the example depicted in Figure 5G. CCL5 is a highly potent
agonist for induction of Ca2+ changes in 300-19-CCR5 cells and
small responses were already detected at CCL5 concentrations
as low as 0.01 nM whereas, CXCL14 on its own was inactive.
We conclude that CXCL14 does not synergize with CCL5 and
its receptor CCR5. The reported inhibitory effect was not further
examined but points to some sort of interaction between CXCL14
and CCR5-expressing cells that appears to be unrelated to the
cellular background (human T cell cultures vs. murine pre￾B cell line).
Finally, we turned to CXCR3, which, similarly to CCR5, is
upregulated in activated T cells under tissue culture conditions
in the presence of IL-2 or IL-2 plus IL-15 (42). In vivo,
CXCR3 recruits Th1 cells to inflammatory sites dominated
by IFNγ and other pro-inflammatory cytokines (which induce
the CXCR3-specific chemokines). Consistent with the increased
promiscuity of the inflammatory chemokine receptors for
chemokines, CXCR3 is selectively activated by three related
chemokines, CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11. Figures 6A–F shows
that expanded CD4+ and CD8+ T cells uniformly expressed
this receptor and efficiently migrated to CXCL10 with peak
responses seen at 100 nM. As reported in Figure 5, CXCL14
by itself was inactive. Also, CXCL14 failed to consistently
synergize with CXCL10 and, by contrast to CCL5 (Figure 5),
an inhibitory effect was not observed. For reasons unknown at
present, a weak synergism between CXCL14 and CXCL10 was
detected when 300-19-CXCR3 cells were used but this effect
was restricted to 1 nM CXCL10 in combination with 300 nM
CXCL14 (Figures 6H,I). The above results were replicated with
CXCL11, including an unexplained synergism with 300-19-
CXCR3 cells between 1 nM CXCL11 and 300 nM CXCL14
(Supplementary Figure S2). As shown in Figure 6J, prominent
Ca2+ changes were not readily detected in 300-19-CXCR3 cells
when “sub-active” concentrations of CXCL10 were combined
with 300 nM CXCL14. Occasional (inconsistent) Ca2+ spikes
may reflect the superior sensitivity of this assay as compared to
chemotactic migration. In summary, and based on our previous
study of CCR2 (29) and our current study of CCR5 and
CXCR3 and their respective chemokine ligands, we conclude
that CXCL14 does not synergize with inflammatory chemokine
systems as prominently (and consistently) as seen in homeostatic
chemokine systems.
DISCUSSION
We here demonstrate that the highly potent synergistic
effect of CXCL14 with other chemokines goes well beyond
CXCL12 as published recently (29). The most robust and
reproducible synergistic responses were seen during in vitro
chemotaxis assays, the prototypical test for defining the
functionality and target cell specificity of chemokines. Based
on these results we conclude that CXCL14 preferentially
synergizes with the major homeostatic chemokines involved
in controlling steady-state processes as diverse as immune
surveillance of secondary lymphoid tissues (CXCL13, CCL19,
CCL21) and tissue development (CXCL12) (42, 43). Migration

chemokines at sub-active concentrations, i.e., concentrations
below the threshold for induction of chemotaxis, did not
reveal clear-cut and consistent synergistic responses. CXCR3-
mediated responses with 300-19-CXCR3 cells represent a notable
exception, where we have observed substantial and as yet
unexplained inter-experimental variations over a time period
of several years. Without excluding “outlier” results, CXCL14
synergized with both CXCL10 and CXCL11 at sub-optimal
(1 nM) concentrations. The outcome of in vitro chemotaxis
is influenced by several factors, including differences in the
running time of the assay and the type and quality of
target cells, posing significant problems for the statistical
analysis of combined data collected from numerous individual
experiments. Perhaps it is more prudent to show all results
individually, in which case the CXCL10 and CXCL11 cannot
be considered synergistic partners for CXCL14 (Figure 6 and
Supplementary Figure S2). In contrast to in vitro chemotaxis,
Ca2+ mobilization responses are much shorter in terms of
initiation (<10 s following addition of chemokines) and duration
(seconds), which may explain their increased sensitivity to
low concentrations of chemokines. Our Ca2+ mobilization
experiments confirmed the synergism seen between CXCL14 and
homeostatic chemokines CXCL13, CCL19, and CCL21 during
in vitro chemotaxis and agrees with our previous CXCL12
studies (29). Interestingly, small synergistic Ca2+ signals were
occasionally observed with CXCL14 in combination with the

inflammatory chemokines (CXCL10, CXCL11, CCL5) whereas
CXCL14 at concentrations of up to 1 µM was inactive on its
own, irrespective of the type of cells examined (fresh or cultured
lymphocytes isolated from peripheral blood or transfected
murine pre-B cells expressing the relevant chemokine receptors)
or the type of in vitro assay (chemotaxis, Ca2+ mobilization,
β-arrestin recruitment) employed. An exhaustive examination
of synergism between CXCL14 and all known chemokines was
well beyond the scope of the present study. Still, in a next
step, we propose to turn our attention to those chemokines
that are known to control immune cell traffic in peripheral
tissues, i.e., chemokines known to be co-expressed with CXCL14
under steady-state conditions in peripheral tissues, including skin
(CCL1/CCR8) and gut (CCL25/CCR9).
Diverse mechanisms have been shown to underlie chemokine
synergy, which collectively translate to enhanced immune cell
migration (42, 43). Of these, the most prominent ones involve the
formation of chemokine heterocomplexes (44). It is thought that
the physical interactions between two synergizing chemokines
results in favorable conformational changes that lower the
threshold concentration of one of the complexed chemokines
for activation of cells expressing the corresponding chemokine
receptor. Heterocomplex-based synergism is not restricted to
chemokines, in that proteins other than chemokines are able to
complex with chemokines and improve their activity (45–50).
In addition to chemokine heterocomplex formation, sequential
and/or simultaneous triggering of more than one type of
chemokine receptor has also been shown to result in synergistic
outcomes in target cells (51). The underlying mechanisms for
this observation was proposed to be due to chemokine receptor￾mediated intersecting signaling pathways leading to synergistic
as opposed to additive cell responses. This is best exemplified
by an earlier study using cells co-expressing CXCR4 and CCR5
in combination with selective receptor antagonists (AMD3100
and maraviroc, respectively) (52). Finally, similar to chemokines
in solution, chemokine receptors themselves are known to
form dynamic aggregates through lateral movements on cell
surfaces, which are thought to modulate ligand selectivity and
transmembrane signaling properties (53). Chemokine receptor￾mediated synergism has been difficult to prove, not least because
of the diversity of GPCRs present on immune cells. However, we
believe that our previous study of synergism between CXCL14
and CXCL12 made a strong case in favor of this model (29).
Here, while interaction between CXCL14 and CXCL12 was ruled
out by several methods, CXCL14 triggered CXCR4 clustering
as a direct consequence of CXCL14 binding to cell surface
CXCR4 (29, 54). In our model, interaction of CXCL14 with
CXCR4 causes enhanced receptor oligomerization comprising of
conformational intermediates of CXCR4 with reduced activation
thresholds that allow signal transduction at low (otherwise sub￾active) concentrations of CXCL12. Our current data led us to
propose that the synergistic effect of CXCL14 is not restricted to
CXCR4 but also includes the homeostatic chemokine receptors
CXCR5 and CCR7. The underlying molecular mechanism may
involve positive allosteric receptor modulation, although we were
unable to demonstrate direct binding of CXCL14 to CCR7 or
CXCR5. Since CXCL14 strongly interacts with proteoglycans (29,
55), it is possible that CXCL14 targets carbohydrate modifications
on cell surface proteins, including CCR7. Also, SPR spectroscopy
monitors molecular interactions in real-time, which may be
more sensitive than steady-state receptor binding protocols
(e.g., flow cytometry) and, thus, explain our previous results
with CXCR4. Nevertheless, the substantial functional synergism
of CXCL14 with chemokines for CXCR4, CXCR5 and CCR7
provides strong impetus to further investigate this phenomenon
at the molecular level.
The physiological relevance of our findings is not clear at
present. In fact, in vivo models for the study of chemokine
synergy are rare. Evidence in support of chemokine synergism
was provided by studies involving the combinatorial injections
of CXCL10 and CCL5 (56), CXCL6 and CCL7 (57) or CXCL1,
CXCL2 and CXCL3 (58), leading to more than additive numbers
of recruited immune cells at sites of injection. Combination of
CXCL4 and CCL5 was shown to exacerbate disease in a mouse
model of atherosclerosis (59), and CXCL12 in combination with
HMGB1 enhanced monocyte recruitment in a mouse model of
tissue damage (49). In our own preliminary studies, we failed
to detect a significant synergistic recruitment of immune cells
in response to intraperitoneal administration of CXCL14 and
CXCL12 (unpublished observations). Nevertheless, the observed
strong synergy with homeostatic chemokines suggests that
synergistic effects involving CXCL14 play a role in healthy,
rather than inflamed, tissues at sites where these chemokines
are co-expressed under constitutive conditions. In fact, we know
that CXCL14 is down-regulated under inflammatory conditions
(2, 7), ruling out a primary influence on the recruitment of
short-lived effector leukocytes. Of interest, CXCL14 and CXCL12
are the most highly conserved members of the large family
of chemokines and mice lacking these chemokines have severe
developmental defects [reviewed in McCully et al. and Nagasawa
(1, 60)]. It is possible that CXCL14 and CXCL12 synergize
during organ development, including neurovascular patterning
(61), eye (62) and connective tissue (63) formation, where
both chemokines are prominently expressed. Of interest, both
chemokines were shown to activate fibroblasts, suggesting that
CXCL14 and CXCL12 may co-operate in controlling fibroblast
functions in various scenarios, including tissue repair, fibrosis
(23–25) and tumor progression (27, 28, 64). CXCL14/CXCL12
synergism could also play a role in metabolic processes, including
glucose metabolism (20) and thermoregulation (65) where lack of
CXCL14 was associated with impaired macrophage recruitment
and abnormal brown adipose tissue formation. Besides CXCL12,
we here show that CXCL14 synergizes with CXCL13, CCL19 and
CCL21, homeostatic chemokines fulfilling critical functions in
the control of primary T and B cell responses (43). Their discrete
expression contributes to the micro-anatomical segregation of T
and B cell zones within secondary lymphoid tissues and disease￾associated ectopic lymphoid-like structures (43, 66). There is no
evidence of CXCL14 production at these sites, but tissue-derived
CXCL14 may gain access via the lymphatic system. Verification
of these models awaits the generation of mouse models featuring
conditional CXCL14 expression at discrete tissue locations.
In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that synergy
of CXCL14 is not restricted to CXCL12 but instead extends

to the homeostatic chemokines CXCL13, CCL19 and CCL21
and their cognate receptors. Consistent synergistic effects with
inflammatory chemokines CXCL10, CXCL11, CCL2 (29) and

conservation of CXCL14 is associated with fine-tuning multiple
local immune and/or tissue cell responses in co-operation with
homeostatic chemokines in peripheral tissues where CXCL14 is
abundantly expressed.
