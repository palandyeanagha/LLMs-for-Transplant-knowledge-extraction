Abstract
Background: Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a well-known neglected parasitic disease. However, evidence supporting
the four current treatment modalities is inadequate, and treatment options remain controversial. The aim of this
work is to analyse the available data to answer clinical questions regarding medical treatment of CE.
Methods: A thorough electronic search of the relevant literature without language restrictions was carried out
using PubMed (Medline), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, BioMed, Database of Abstracts of Reviews
of Effects, and Cochrane Plus databases up to February 1, 2017. All descriptive studies reporting an assessment of
CE treatment and published in a peer-reviewed journal with available full-text were considered for a qualitative
analysis. Randomized controlled trials were included in a quantitative meta-analysis. We used the standard
methodological procedures established by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
statement.
Results: We included 33 studies related to the pharmacological treatment of CE in humans. Of these, 22 studies
with levels of evidence 2 to 4 were qualitatively analysed, and 11 randomized controlled trials were quantitatively
analysed by meta-analysis.
Conclusions: Treatment outcomes are better when surgery or PAIR (Puncture, Aspiration, Injection of protoscolicidal agent
and Reaspiration) is combined with benzimidazole drugs given pre- and/or post-operation. Albendazole chemotherapy
was found to be the primary pharmacological treatment to consider in the medical management of CE. Nevertheless,
combined treatment with albendazole plus praziquantel resulted in higher scolicidal and anti-cyst activity and was more
likely to result in cure or improvement relative to albendazole alone.

Background
Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a neglected zoonosis caused
by Echinococcus spp., mostly Echinococcus granulosus. Its
huge socio-economic impact has been recently recognized.
[1, 2]. CE has a worldwide geographical distribution, and the
Mediterranean basin is considered an important endemic
area [3]. Four treatment options are currently available:
i) surgery, ii) PAIR, iii) chemotherapy with albendazole,
mebendazole or other anthelmintic drugs, and iv) watch
and wait for inactive or silent cysts. There is lack of evi￾dence that supports treatment options [4]. This may be
because several constraints in health-care system and CE
is a chronic, complex disease [5]. Medical treatment is
used for reducing cysts, decreasing infectivity and avoiding
relapses. Besides, drugs are useful in disseminated or
inoperable CE as the sole modality of treatment. To
date, the medical treatment of CE is based on drugs of the
benzimidazole family, usually albendazole [6, 7]. Over the
last few years, praziquantel has been associated with
albendazole [8, 9]. In addition, other drugs like nitazoxa￾nide have also been used in disseminated CE [10]. Despite
World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations,

there is no standard for the medical management of CE,
and variability exists in the timing of treatment initiation,
dose and duration, which remain undefined.
The aim of this study is to analyse available data to
answer the following clinical questions regarding the
medical treatment of CE: i) Could pharmacological
treatment improve the results of surgical interventions?
ii) Is albendazole more effective than mebendazole? iii)
Should albendazole be administered alone or in combin￾ation with praziquantel?
Methods
Search strategy and criteria for study selection
A systematic search of PubMed (Medline), Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), BioMed,
DARE (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects), and
Cochrane Plus databases was conducted without language
restrictions to identify studies that assessed the efficacy
of medical treatment of CE and had been published up
to February 1, 2017.
The following search key words and Boolean operators
were entered: (“cystic echinococosis” OR “hydatid disease”,
OR “Echinococcus granulosus”) AND (“medical treatment”
OR “albendazole” OR “mebendazole” OR “praziquantel”)
AND (“randomized controlled trials”) AND “humans”
[AND NOT “animals”]. Additional records were also
identified through other sources (UpToDate) (Add￾itional file 1).
All relevant studies that reported the assessment of
one modality of treatment or a comparison of two or
several therapeutic methods to treat CE in humans and
were published in a peer-reviewed journal with full text
available were considered for analysis and classified accord￾ing to levels of evidence and grades of recommendation
proposed by the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based
Medicine (OCEBM) [11]. Data from editorials, letters to
editors, reports of expert committees, and opinions of
respected authorities based on clinical experience were
excluded from the analysis because these designs do
not have the same value, impact or power to make
decisions or make recommendations. The results from
non-randomized controlled trials, cohort or case-control
analytic studies, prospective or retrospective case series,
and literature reviews were qualitatively analysed but
excluded from our quantitative meta-analysis. We in￾cluded in the meta-analysis only studies from random￾ized controlled trials [Level of Evidence 1, Grade of
recommendation A].
Data extraction and quality assessment
After the relevant studies had been identified and selected,
a systematic method was applied to data collection from
each included study. The data collected were the first
author’s name, year of publication, country of origin,
study objective, study design, trial time period, number
of patients, population characteristics, number of cysts,
cyst location, mean cyst size, treatment, endpoint, main
quantitative findings and conclusions. All relevant texts,
tables and figures were reviewed for data extraction. A
quality evaluation of each study was done, and conclusions
were based on levels of evidence and grades of recommen￾dation according to OCEBM [11].
The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement [12] was used as
a guide. Prespecified outcome-specific quality criteria
were used to judge the admission of each qualitative and
quantitative outcome into the appropriate analysis. Two
investigators independently reviewed each eligible study
and extracted the information and data necessary to
carry out the qualitative analysis and the meta-analysis.
Disagreements were resolved by consensus among all
authors. The authors evaluated all randomized trials
included in the meta-analysis to determine whether they
were in accordance with the CONsolidated Standards Of
Reporting Trials-CONSORT 2010 statement [12].
Meta-analysis methods
Meta-analysis was performed utilizing the Cochrane
Review Manager (RevMan 5.3) software. Statistical signifi￾cance was defined at the level of 0.05. Recommendations of
the PRISMA statement were considered as the outcome
measure is dichotomic odds ratio was used as effect size.
To combine studies to find a summary effect, we have
resorted to the Mantel-Haenselz statistical weights.
Heterogeneity across studies was followed with the
Cochrane Q-statistic (whereby p ≤ 0.05 was considered
statistically significant), and homogenicity of studies was
rejected. The I2
-statistic was also used to describe the
percentage of total heterogenicity across studies. The
following suggested cut-off points were used: I2 = 0–25%,
no heterogeneity; I2 = 25–50%, moderate heterogeneity;
I
2 = 50–75%, large heterogeneity; I2 = 75–100%, extreme
heterogeneity. A fixed-effect model was used if the p-value
for Q was > 0.05 and I2 was < 50%. However, if both statis￾tics rejected the homogeneity hypothesis, a random-effect
model was used. The significance of the pooled odds ratio
was evaluated with the Z test and its two-tailed p-value.
Forest plots with odds ratios and their 95% confidence
intervals were used to visualize all results. Unfortunately,
the small amount of combinative data published to date
did not allow any analysis of publication bias or validation,
but the reported values in the present work can be consid￾ered consistent.

By searching the electronic database, we identified 826
records related to the medical treatment of CE. Addition￾ally, 10 records were identified through other sources. Six
publications were removed because they were duplicate
records. We screened 830 records, 741 of them were
excluded for not meeting the inclusion criteria or full-text
were not available. Eighty-nine full text articles were read
in entirety. Fifty-six full-text articles were excluded for
reasons including diagnosis (7), animal studies (4), studies
of Alveolar echinococcosis (1), surgery treatment and PAIR
without chemotherapy (42) and case reports/expert
opinion [Level of Evidence 5] (2).
Thirty-three articles [6, 8–10, 13–41] related to medical
treatment of CE in humans that met the inclusion criteria of
CE treatment in humans were selected and classified by type
of study design. Of them, 22 studies [6, 10, 13–32] non-ran￾domized controlled trials, prospective or retrospective case
series and literature reviews [Levels of Evidence 2 to 4] were
qualitatively analysed, and 11 randomized controlled trials
[8, 9, 33–41] [Level of Evidence 1] were quantitatively ana￾lysed by meta-analysis.
Qualitative synthesis
This analysis included 22 studies [6, 10, 13–32] with levels
of evidence below 1 (2 to 4): non-randomized controlled
trial, one paper [13]; cohort study, one paper [21]; pro￾spective descriptive study, six papers [15, 17, 22, 24, 25, 29];
retrospective study, six papers [16, 18, 23, 26, 28, 32]; and
case series, two papers [10, 30] (Table 1 summarizes the
main data of these studies in alphabetical order).
We also included four papers corresponding to literature
reviews [14, 20, 27, 31] and two systematic reviews [6, 19]
in this qualitative analysis (Table 2).
Chronologically, the oldest publication dates back to
1992 from Todorov et al. [29], while the most current
was published in 2012 by Ghoshal et al. [18].
The geographic location of studies is varied: England
(UK) [14, 19], Germany [6, 20], Italy [15], Spain [10],

Of major importance in the
management of CE is long-term
observation and longitudinal
monitoring. Liver cysts relapse
more frequently than do cysts at
other sites, presumably because
of greater proliferative potential
of the metacestode tissue
remaining in the hepatic
environment. Further cycles of
benzimidazole treatment of
patients with recurrences were
again well tolerated and effective.
It was suggested that the higher

In relation to the study population, ten papers corres￾pond to studies in adult patients [10, 13, 15, 17, 18, 22,
24–26, 30], three papers are studies in pediatric patients
[16, 21, 28], seven studies are in both adults and pediatric
patients [6, 19, 20, 23, 27, 29, 32], and two literature
reviews covered both animal and human studies [14, 31].
The sample sizes of the studies were very different; 5745
school-age children participated in a study cohort [21],
3760 adult and pediatric patients were included in a
systematic review [19], and 7 [10] and 4 [30] adult
patients were included in the case series. Other sample

49, 40 and 27 patients.
Relative to cyst location, the studies principally analysed
multi-organ/abdominal cysts [6, 10, 14, 17, 19–22, 24,
27–32], liver [13, 15, 23, 25, 26] and lungs [16, 18].
The drug used in most antihelmintic therapies is alben￾dazole [6, 10, 13, 16–24, 26–32], alone or combined with
mebendazole [6, 15, 16, 20, 27, 29] or praziquantel [10, 14,

outcomes are better when surgery or PAIR is combined
with pharmacological therapy of benzimidazole drugs given
pre- and/or post-operation. Based on a qualitative synthesis,
there was a positive and statistically significant association
between cyst size and treatment results. More cysts showed
statistical improvement with albendazole than with
praziquantel or mebendazol. Albendazole combined with
mebendazole or praziquantel performed better than alben￾dazole alone.
Quantitative synthesis using meta-analysis
The meta-analysis included 11 randomized controlled
trials [8, 9, 33–41] [Level of Evidence 1, Grade of recom￾mendation A]. The main methodological characteristics of
these studies are presented in Table 3, and therapeutic
findings are shown in Table 4. Chronologically, the oldest
publication dates back to 1986 (Davis et al. [34]), while the
most current was published in 2011 (Shams-UI-Bari et al.
[41]). The geographic location varies, including Turkey
[33], Spain [9, 37], Switzerland [34, 35], Italy [36], Iran
[38, 39], India [40, 41] and Saudi Arabia [8].
Most of the participants in the clinical trials were adult
patients. The mean age (range age) of the participants
was 36.7 (16–64) years in the Shams-UI-Bari et al. [41]
study, and the maximum age was 52 (4–84) in the work
of Franchi et al. [36]. The sample size of the studies varies,
from 448 patients [36] to 15 [17] [others samples sizes
were 121, 112, 84, 72, 55, 47, 41, 30 and 21 patients]. The
number of cysts varied from 33 reported by Khuroo et
al. [40] to 929 in Franchi et al. [35]. Most of the studies
analysed multi-organ/abdominal cyts [8, 34–37, 39], liver [9,
33, 40, 41] and lung [38].
Several studies analysed albendazole alone [33, 37–41] or
in combination with mebendazole [34–36] or praziquantel
[8, 9]. Endpoints were protoscolex and cyst viability (viable/
non-viable or intact/dead), and/or response to treatment
(cured, improved, no changed, worsened). Due to differ￾ences among articles, we could not extract data for statis￾tical treatment from 4 out of 11 papers. In the study by
Franchi et al. [35], cysts treated with albendazole relapsed
in 134/640 (20.9%) cases, while the rate for mebendazole
treatment was 37/289 (12.8%). In the case series by
Keshmiri et al. 1999 [38] and 2001 [39], only one case
relapsed following albendazole treatment (1/11; 9.1%),
and 1/17 (5.8%) relapsed following mebendazole treatment.
According to Shams-UI-Bari et al. [41], patients who did
not receive albendazole therapy reported a recurrence rate
of 6/36 (16.6%), while no recurrence was reported in
patients who received albendazole therapy (p < 0.01).
Albendazole therapy was associated with fewer recur￾rences than mebendazole therapy.
Seven studies were examined in three meta-analyses,
as described below.
i) Albendazole plus surgery versus surgery alone. Blidik
et al. [33], Gil-Grande et al. [37], Khuroo et al. [40],
and Shams-UI-Bari et al. [41] address this issue.
These studies compare albendazole plus surgery to
surgery alone and analyse the viability of the scolex as
a common point. In all 3 studies, the number of
non-viable scolex in the experimental group
(albendazole plus surgery) is higher than the
control group (surgery alone) (Tables 3 and 4). These
three studies were significantly heterogeneous (p = 0.01
for Q test and 78% for I2
), so a random-effects
model was used. The results are shown as a forest
plot in Fig. 2.
The summary odds ratio was 48, which is clearly
significant in favor of albendazole plus surgery, with
a p-value of 0.002 according to the Z test.
Davis et al. 1986 [34], Davis et al. 1989 [35],
Keshmiri et al. 1999 [38] and Keshmiri et al. 2001
[39] answer the second clinical question that we
considered in this meta-analysis:
ii) Albendazole versus mebendazole. These studies
compare albendazole to mebendazole (Fig. 3) and
analyse the response to treatment (cured, improved,
no changed, worsened) as a common point. In all
studies, the proportion of cysts cured/success or
improvement in the experimental group
(albendazole) is higher than that in the control
group (mebendazole or placebo) (Table 4).

Figure 3 (forest plot) shows the results [34, 35]. The
Q test of heterogeneity was not significant (p = 0.73),
indicating excellent homogeneity (I2 = 0%) of these
studies.
iii) Albendazole versus placebo. These studies compare
albendazole to placebo and analyze the response to
treatment (cured, improved, no changed, worsened)
as a common point. In both studies, the proportion
of radiological cured/success or improvement in the
experimental group (albendazole) is higher than
that in the control group (placebo). Figure 4 shows
the results obtained from comparing albendazole to
placebo [38, 39].
The test of heterogeneity was not significant (p = 0.89),
indicating excellent homogeneity (I2 = 0%).
Cobo et al. [9], answer the third clinical question
that we considered in this meta-analysis.
iv) Albendazole versus albendazole plus praziquantel.
It was not possible to statistically combine the data
comparing albendazole plus praziquantel treatment
to albendazole alone. However, an answer is given
in Mohamed et al. [8] and Cobo et al. [9]. In the
latter paper [9], the number of non-viable scoleces in
the albendazole plus praziquantel group was higher
than in the albendazole alone group. According to
Mohamed et al. [8], the reduction in the number of
cysts and cases cured or improved in the albendazole
plus praziquantel group was higher than it was in
albendazole alone group (Table 4). It was not possible
to generate a forest plot.
Discussion
The clinical handling of CE involves four therapeutic
alternatives: surgery, percutaneous intervention, drugs,
and the “watch and wait” approach for quiescent cysts.
The evidence supporting pharmacological treatment is
weak. This lack in quality is due to i) small number of
patients forming an homogeneous clinical group, even in
referral hospitals in endemic countries; ii) the different
applied methodology prevents comparison between studies;
iii) CE is a chronic disease, which requires long-term moni￾toring to determinate the effectiveness of an intervention
[42]. There are no gold standard methods to determinate
biological status and response to treatment [37]. Drug￾induced echographic changes can be compare with viability
studies of protoscoleces developed on surgically removed
cysts, which would generate parasitological data to correlate
with clinical effects. These objectives were used by Gil
Grande et al. [37] in their randomized controlled trial of
the efficacy of albendazole, but data collection has not been
posible for praziquantel, despite its clinical use in last
20 years. Furthermore, hydatid cysts may spontaneously

regress with shedding of membranes, solidifying and
calcification in their natural history, without any che￾motherapeutic assistance [43].
Despite attempts by the WHO, the management of CE
disease remains a major problem [44]. There is no con￾sensus on disease management [1, 45]. Thereby, studies
to establish the efficacy of medical treatment, the dosing
and the minimal effective dose have not been yet deter￾mined by sufficient evidence. Case definitions, diagnostic
proceedings and defined monitoring methods for long￾term follow-up need to be standardised, and comparative
efficacy surveys need to be performed. Future progress in
chemotherapy may be attained by identifying drugs with
higher anti-echinococcal activity.
Clinical question 1
Surgery/PAIR vs surgery/PAIR plus albendazole/
mebendazole
Our data show that treatment outcomes are better when
surgery or PAIR is combined with chemotherapy of
benzimidazole drugs given pre- and/or post-surgery. The
summary odds ratio found in the meta-analysis shows a
value of 48 (95% CI: 4–586), which is far greater than the
value of 1 that would indicate equality of the treatments.
Chemotherapy is applied in many scenarios, so it is very
difficult to standardize the results. Anthelmintics are usually
indicated before and after surgery to reduce the size of cysts,
to sterilise them, and to prevent relapses. Furthermore,
medical treatment is the only therapeutic option in scattered
CE and/or inoperable CE. To date, there are insufficient
data to establish the optimal duration of treatment or
frequency of dose. Recommendations on the timing of the
start of chemotherapy before surgery or PAIR are varied.
Preoperative treatment with albendazole begins at least
3 months to 1 day before surgery and/or PAIR and
continues for 1–3 months post-treatment, and there is no
clear recommendation on praziquantel dosage schedules. In
terms of cyst viability and radiological efficacy, the data are
not conclusive as to whether longer courses of treatment
(3 months) are more efficacious than shorter courses of
treatment [19, 37].
The additional benefit from very long treatment (more
than 6 months) is marginal for most patients, and although
it is performed in clinical practice with patients with
multiple or inoperable CE, it has never been well evaluated.
There is a suggestion that lesions in organs other than
the liver, lung and peritoneum may benefit from more
prolonged therapy, but the numbers are small.
Clinical question 2
Albendazole vs. mebendazole
Our data show in all of the studies that the odds ratio of
cure/success or improvement in the albendazole group
is greater than those in the other groups (mebendazole
or placebo). To be exact, the summary odds ratio for
albendazole versus mebendazole was 2.4 (95% CI: 1.3,
4.4) with a p-value of 0.006. There is some evidence that
albendazole should be chosen over mebendazole, at least
until more trials are reported. As expected, the compari￾son of albendazole and placebo is in favor of the drug
treatment, with a p-value of 0.002 for the Z test of
significance.
Mebendazole is a broad-spectrum antihelminthic agent
of the benzimidazole type with in vivo activity in CE.
Nevertheless, albendazole is more active in vitro than
mebendazole and has better gastrointestinal uptake and
bioavailability [46]. It has been published better clinical
outcomes with albendazole [47]. Flubendazole is not
already used for hydatidosis. Testing hepatic enzymes
and blood count every 2 weeks is recommended during
benzimidazole treatment to monitor most frequent
adverse effects [48]. Although it is orally administered,
albendazole results in high serum concentration but
penetration into cyst is patchy. Albendazole and mebenda￾zole may reduce volume of hydatid cysts and may become
them sterile in some cases [47]. However, less than half
treated patients achieve clinical and radiological resolution
without concomitant drainage [47]. Albendazole, with or
Fig. 4 Forest plot of comparison: intervention (albendazole) vs control (placebo), outcome: Response to treatment (Event = cure/success
plus improvement)

without PAIR, is usually given in two divided doses
(10–15 mg/kg/day) or 400 mg once a day. Daily dose of
mebendazol is 40–50 mg/kg in three divided doses.
Treatment may be administered in several cycles (1–6)
separated by 10–14 days. Clinical and radiographic im￾provement is frequently noticeable. Radiological endpoints
are commonly defined as more than 25% decreases in cyst
size, membrane detachment or cyst calcification. Cyst
disappearance occurs in less than 50% of patients in
medical treatment [49]. Our data show that the efficacy
of albendazole was superior to that of mebendazole,
with a p-value of 0.009. Although there are works that
show that the rate of relapse was similar for patients
treated with albendazole or mebendazole, it is necessary
to carry out prospective studies over long periods to
generate robust data.
Clinical question 3
Albendazole vs albendazole plus praziquantel
Our data show that combined treatment with albendazole
plus praziquantel is superior to treatment with albendazole
alone.
Praziquantel, an isoquinolone derivative, has had limited
use in the treatment of CE [47]. Praziquantel has shown
efficacy in vitro and in animal models. Weekly dose of
50 mg/kg or dose every 2 weeks have displayed suitable
pharmacokinetics in humans [47]. There are few clinical
studies documenting praziquantel benefits in humans
[8, 9, 30, 50]; however, combination of praziquantel
with mebendazole [50] or albendazole [8, 9] seems to be
more effective and possibly more rapid than benzimidazole
monotherapy. The earliest report of a trial of combination
praziquantel and albendazole in the treatment of human
hydatid disease was made by Yasawy et al. [30]. Major
disadvantages of these works are different praziquantel
schemes: various treatment groups are too small for
significant analysis and failure to use matching controls
[8, 30]. Combination of praziquantel and albendazole may
produce some benefit in pre- and post-intervention
chemotherapy and might be helpful when spillage occurs
during surgical procedure [8, 9]. Combined treatment
reduces potentially the risk of disease recurrence and
intraperitoneal seeding of infection that may develop
via cyst rupture and spillage. Additionally, praziquantel
may prevent the vesicular development of protoscoleces
and inhibit the formation of secondary cysts. Combination
therapy increases levels of albendazole sulphoxide (the
active metabolite of albendazole) both in serum and in
cyst fluid compared with levels in patients received only
albendazole [14]. Praziquantel has been given at a dose of
40 mg/kg in different regimens for each patient (daily,
weekly, fortnightly or monthly) with standard courses of
albendazole for between 2 and 3 months. At present, there
is scarce evidence supporting a recommendation for the
routine use of praziquantel in prolonged chemotherapy for
established CE where surgery is not indicated or in severe
disseminated disease. This treatment and dosage regimen
require evaluation. Further randomized controlled studies
are required to determine whether there are significant
advantages of combination therapy with albendazole and
praziquantel to clarify treatment recommendations. Finally,
there are few medical therapeutic options available for CE.
As there is some evidence of usefulness of praziquantel in
this disease, potential benefits should be explore.
Limitations
One of the limitations of this study was the calculation
of overall effects in the meta-analysis sections due to the
scarcity of data. Some authors argue that, since clinical and
methodological diversity always occurs in meta-analyses, a
good statistical combination of studies is always difficult
[51, 52]. Nevertheless, a qualitative review and a meta-ana￾lysis are better than a lack of information. The authors used
forest plots to interpret the results of the meta-analyses,
which is an accepted methodology. However, when there
are few studies, these plots and their associated tests of sig￾nificance are not very robust, and more studies are neces￾sary to obtain conclusive evidence.
Risks of bias (methodological and clinical) may have a
bearing on the results of our qualitative review and
meta-analysis. The overall effect of meta-analysis may be
affected by publication bias, overestimating the efficacy
of treatment, since studies with statistically significant
results are more likely to be published than those with
non-significant differences. Funnel plots visually check the
possible existence of publication bias, but unfortunately,
this type of analysis cannot be used when the number of
included studies is scarce, as it was the case here.
Despite these limitations, this systematic review and
meta-analysis seeks to synthesize the large volume of
information available up to date related to medical
treatment of CE to help make decisions on evidence-based
medicine in daily clinical practice.
Conclusions
Does our study provide sufficient evidence to influence
decisions for the treatment of CE?
In the opinion of the authors, this analysis of the literature
suggests the following claims: i) pharmacological treatment
improves results in patients with CE who will undergo
surgical treatment; ii) for now, albendazole chemotherapy
is the primary medical treatment to consider in the medical
management of CE; and iii) treatment with albendazole
plus praziquantel shows higher scolicidal activity and a
greater number of cysts cured or improved compared
to albendazole alone.
