using a vein graft from the resected portion 
of the liver

Abstract
Background: The middle hepatic veins are often infiltrated by intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Reconstruction of 
the hepatic vein plays a critical role in preserving more of the residual liver volume and reducing the risk of postop￾erative liver failure in extreme hepatectomy. We here report a novel way to reconstruct middle hepatic vein by using 
vessel grafts from wasted liver.
Case presentation: Case 1: A 64-year-old man was diagnosed with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. The bifurcation 
and left branch of the portal vein were stenosed, and the root of the middle hepatic vein was infiltrated by the tumor. 
An extended left hepatectomy was performed, the portal vein was resected and reconstructed, and the middle 
hepatic vein was reconstructed by anastomosing the proximal left hepatic vein to the distal middle hepatic vein. Case 
2: A 69-year-old woman was diagnosed with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. The tumor was located in the left lobe 
of the liver and the left and middle hepatic veins were infiltrated by the tumor. An extended left hepatectomy was 
performed, and the left portal vein was used as a vein graft to reconstruct the middle hepatic vein. Both of the two 
patients’ postoperative ultrasound showed vessel graft patency.
Conclusion: Using a vein graft from the resected portion of the liver to reconstruct the middle hepatic vein was a 
useful technique and showed good result.

Background
Normal segmental liver function depends on whether 
there is sufficient blood flow. Insufficient blood flow 
into or out of the liver can lead to liver dysfunction. The 
middle hepatic veins are often infiltrated by intrahepatic 
cholangiocarcinoma due to its biological characteristics. 
Reconstruction of the hepatic vein plays a critical role in 
preserving more of the residual liver volume and reduc￾ing the risk of postoperative liver failure in extreme hepa￾tectomy. Vessel grafts for reconstruction of the middle 
hepatic vein include an autologous saphenous vein [1, 2], 
the internal jugular vein [3], the ovarian vein [4–6], the 
umbilical vein [6–8], an artificial vessel [9], and an alloge￾neic vessel [10, 11]. The use of vessel grafts from wasted 
liver has advantages of less damage and more similar 
character for middle hepatic vein reconstruction. This 
report describes the methods used to reconstruct the 
middle hepatic vein using a vein graft from the resected 
portion of the liver, which is rarely reported before.

and a CA 19–9 level of 246.2 U/mL. Abdominal CT 
revealed a lesion in the hilar bile duct with indistinct 
margins; the tumor was moderately enhanced during 
the arterial phase, and the intrahepatic bile ducts were 
dilated (Fig.  1). The bifurcation and left branch of the 
portal vein were stenosed, and the root of the mid￾dle hepatic vein was affected by the lesion (Figs.  2, 3, 
4). The patient was diagnosed with intrahepatic chol￾angiocarcinoma. Total liver volume was 1666  mL and 
the standard liver volume was 1590.9 mL. The volume 
of the right posterior lobe was 591 mL, accounting for 
35.5% of the total liver volume, and the volume of the 
right hepatic liver accounted for 75% of the total liver 
volume (Fig. 5). An extended left hepatectomy was per￾formed, and the portal vein was resected and recon￾structed. The left hepatic vein was not infiltrated by the 
tumor while the venous wall of the middle hepatic vein 
was infiltrated by the tumor. Accordingly, the affected 
portion of the middle hepatic vein was resected, the left 
hepatic vein was dissected, and the middle hepatic vein

was reconstructed by anastomosing the proximal left 
hepatic vein to the distal middle hepatic vein (Figs.  6, 
7). The operation time was 620  min, the blood loss 
was 800 mL. The pathological findings showed: poorly 
differentiated intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, the 
resection margin of MHV was 1  cm from tumor, and 
the resection margin of PV was 0.8  cm from tumor. 
One metastasis was found in lymph node of No. 12. No 
metastasis was found in lymph node of No. 8, 9, 13a. 
The patient was followed up in outpatient clinic, he had 
recurrence in the omentum majus after 10  months of 
operation, and died after 18 months of operation with 
just supportive treatment.
Patient 2
The patient was a 69-year-old woman who had upper 
abdominal pain for 3  months prior. CT revealed “a 
lesion in the left lobe of the liver that was enhanced 
in the arterial and portal phases. The left and middle 
hepatic veins were infiltrated by a tumor (Fig. 8).” Blood 
tests indicated an alanine aminotransferase level of 13.4 
U/L, an aspartate aminotransferase level of 18.5 U/L, 
an alkaline phosphatase level of 106.4 U/L, a gamma 
glutamyl transpeptidase level of 38.0U/L, a total bili￾rubin level of 14.08 umol/L, a direct bilirubin level of

with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Preoperative 
liver function assessment indicated a Child–Pugh score 
of A, an ICG R15 of 2.4%, a standard liver volume of 
1,039.1  mL, and a total liver volume of 957  mL. The 
volume of the right liver lobe was 605 mL, accounting 
for 58.2% of the standard liver volume and 63.2% of the 
total liver volume. The volume of the left liver lobe was 
352 mL (Fig. 9). An extended left hepatectomy was per￾formed. The location and orientation of the tumor were 
verified intraoperatively with ultrasound, and then the 
liver parenchyma was separated to isolate the middle 
hepatic vein from its root to its distal end. The left liver 
lobe and the affected portion of the middle hepatic vein 
were removed. The left portal vein was used as a vein 
graft to reconstruct the middle hepatic vein (Fig.  10). 
Postoperative ultrasound showed the reconstructed 
vein was patent (Fig.  11). The operation time was 
600 min, the blood loss was 300 mL. The pathological 
findings showed: moderately differentiated intrahepatic 
cholangiocarcinoma, the resection margin of MHV 
was 1  cm from tumor, no microvascular invasion was 
seen. No metastasis was found in lymph node of No. 8, 
9, 12, 13a. The patient was regularly followed in outpa￾tient clinic and there was no recurrence evidence and 
complications. The follow-up was 2 years and 6 months 
until now.

Discussion
Takahashi et al. found that liver function is closely related 
to blood flow [12]. It is important to ensure sufficient 
blood supply to the liver, but the patency of blood out￾flow from the liver is also very important. The major 
hepatic veins are often infiltrated by intrahepatic cholan￾giocarcinoma for the anatomical and pathological char￾acteristics. If extensive liver resection for R0 resection 
results in liver blood outflow obstructed which leads to 
residual liver congestion, liver function is likely to dimin￾ish. So it is necessary to evaluate the area of hepatic vein 
preoperatively to decide whether and how to reconstruct 
the infiltrated hepatic vein.
The area of congested liver can be confirmed during 
surgery. Murata et al. found that when hepatic veins were 
occluded, the hepatic artery was the sole vessel for sup￾plying blood to the liver, and the portal vein drained the 
congested portion of the liver [13]. Therefore, clamping a 
hepatic vein prior to resection and clamping the hepatic 
artery at the same time during surgery reveals the bound￾ary of congested on the surface of the liver surface within 
5 min [14]. The non-congested liver remnant volume can 
also be revealed during surgery with indocyanine green 
fluorescence imaging and hepatic vein clamping tech￾nique [15]. But this technique does not work sometimes. 
We have only one chance to use it during surgery [15]. 
When the hepatic veins are incompletely clamped, we 
cannot get the correct results. So, more liver remnant 
volume analysis methods are required, such as preopera￾tive three-dimensional image reconstruction [14, 16]. The 
non-congested liver remnant volume can be determined 
by analyzing the volume of blood that each hepatic vein 
and its branches drains from each segment. With these 
methods, we can perform surgery safely by retaining 
enough liver volume which was normal on blood inflow 
and outflow.
Based on a study of living donor liver transplants, Sano 
et al. devised a criterion for hepatic vein reconstruction: 
the relevant volume of the congested liver should be 
subtracted from the remnant liver or the graft liver vol￾ume. When the remaining liver volume is less than 30% 
of the standard liver volume in normal liver resection or 
less than 40% in liver transplantation, reconstruction of 
the hepatic vein or its tributaries should be considered

[14]. Based on a study of liver tumor resection, Mise 
et al. devised a criterion for hepatic vein reconstruction: 
venous reconstruction is recommended in patients with 
non-congested liver remnant volume smaller than 40% of 
total liver volume (TLV) when ICGR15 is less than 10% 
or non-congested liver remnant volume smaller than 50% 
of total liver volume when ICGR15 is 10–20% [16]. In 
some cases, liver volume increased because of continuous

obstructive jaundice. So, for safety, we set 40% of both 
SLV and TLV as the cut-off value to reconstruct hepatic 
vein or its tributaries in liver tumor resection operation. 
When future non-congested liver remnant volume is 
smaller than 40% of SLV or TLV, hepatic vein reconstruc￾tion is needed to ensure blood outflow from the liver.
In Case 1, if the remnant liver is drained only by the 
right hepatic vein without reconstruction of the mid￾dle hepatic vein, the non-congested liver remnant vol￾ume is 630 mL, accounting for 37.8% of the total liver 
volume and 39.6% of the standard liver volume (Fig. 5). 
Diminished liver function can likely occur, so mid￾dle hepatic vein reconstruction must be factored into 
preoperative analysis. Blood outflow from the liver was 
ascertained postoperatively using ultrasound (Fig.  7), 
and liver function was normal. In Case 2, the volume 
drained by the right hepatic vein was 378 mL, account￾ing for 39.5% of the total liver volume and 36.4% of the 
standard liver volume (Fig.  9), so middle hepatic vein 
reconstruction was needed according to preoperative 
analysis. In case 2, we also confirmed the congested 
liver volume during surgery. The common trunk of the 
left and middle hepatic vein was clamped and then the 
right hepatic artery was clamped, revealing an area of 
congestion (Fig.  12) that was drained by the middle 
hepatic vein and that coincided with the area indicated

by preoperative analysis. Hepatic vein reconstruction 
involving preoperative and intraoperative evaluation 
was required in both cases described in this report.
The vessel grafts used for hepatic veins reconstruc￾tion include autologous saphenous veins [1, 2], the 
internal jugular veins [3], the ovarian veins[4–6], the 
umbilical veins [6–8], artificial blood vessels [9], and 
allogeneic iliac vessels [10, 11]. When using a saphen￾ous vein, the internal jugular vein, or the ovarian vein, 
a normal vessel needs to be harvested from the patient, 
thus increasing the number of surgical sites. An artifi￾cial blood vessel initially allows reconstruction of the 
hepatic vein, but it is less effective later on in compari￾son to a harvested vessel [9, 17]. Allogeneic blood ves￾sels take time to acquire and cryopreserve. In the cases 
reported here, the vessels on the resected side of the 
liver were used as grafts to reconstruct the hepatic vein. 
The vessels used included the portal vein and a hepatic 
vein. The availability of blood vessels was assessed 
preoperatively, and the vascular grafts were harvested 
intraoperatively.
In Case 1, the tumor had not infiltrated the left hepatic 
vein and the tumor was sufficiently distant from the bifur￾cation of the left hepatic and middle hepatic veins, so 
the left hepatic vein was used to reconstruct the middle 
hepatic vein. Makuuchi et  al. first reported a technique 
in which the left hepatic vein flap was used to repair the 
wall of the middle hepatic vein after the left hepatic vein 
and part of the lateral wall of the middle hepatic vein 
were removed because the left and middle hepatic veins 
had been infiltrated by a tumor [18]. The approach used 
in the current case differed slightly. Because the MHV 
was infiltrated by tumor, but the left hepatic vein was not 
infiltrated, so about 3 cm of the MHV trunk was resected 
from its root, and the trunk of the left hepatic vein was 
used to repair this part of MHV. In Case 2, the tumor had 
infiltrated the middle and left hepatic veins but was dis￾tant from the portal vein, so the left branch of the portal 
vein was used as a vessel graft to reconstruct the middle 
hepatic vein (Fig. 10). Ikegami et al. [19] and Junrungsee 
et al. [20] had reported MHV reconstruction with recipi￾ent’s explanted portal vein in living donor liver trans￾plantation. In this case, we reconstructed MHV with the 
trunk of portal vein in the resected liver itself.
In intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, the middle hepatic 
vein is usually infiltrated by a tumor at its central part. 
Therefore, the middle hepatic vein was first dissected 
from its root to the portion infiltrated by tumor and then 
dissected from its distal end to the tumor-infiltrated por￾tion; this facilitates determining the length of middle 
hepatic vein trunk infiltrated by tumor and the specific 
location of the tumor, which is also good for bleeding 
control when dissociating liver parenchyma.
This report describes a method of harvesting a vascu￾lar graft from the portion of the liver that will be excised. 
Advantages of this approach include less damage than 
when using self-saphenous veins and self-internal jugular 
veins, highly similar characters than other grafts, obviates 
the need to wait for an allogeneic blood vessel. A limita￾tion of this approach is that available blood vessels in the 
liver need to be assessed before removal.
With the development of surgical techniques, more 
extreme liver resection can be performed safely, espe￾cially for tumor which infiltrates key vessels. There are 
different vessel grafts with special advantages. We report 
two cases where vessel grafts from resected portion of 
liver were used, and find there are more advantages with 
good result. In future, more cases are needed to verify its 
effect.
