BACKGROUND: In 2004, a new biomarker sCD14-subtypes (presepsin) was found and its value 
was shown in the diagnosis and evaluation of sepsis. This article is a brief overview of the new biomarker.
DATA SOURCES: A literature search using multiple databases was performed for articles, 
especially meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and randomized controlled trials.
RESULTS: Compared with other markers, presepsin seems to have a better sensitivity and 
specificity in the diagnosis of sepsis. Presepsin as a biom1arker is not only suitable for the early 
diagnosis of sepsis, but also for the assessment of its severity and prognosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Presepsin has a higher sensitivity and specifi city in the diagnosis of sepsis as 
a new biomarker, and is a predictor for the prognosis of sepsis. More importantly, preseptin seems 
to play a crucial role as a supplemental method in the early diagnosis of sepsis. Since there is no 
multicenter study on the relationship between presepsin and sepsis, further studies on the clinical 
values of presepsin are needed.

 INTRODUCTION 
Sepsis is a potentially fatal whole-body infl ammation 
(a systemic inflammatory response syndrome or SIRS) 
caused by severe infection.[1] Its clinical manifestations 
vary with a rapid progression. As a costly disease, sepsis 
not only lowers patient’s living quality, but also increases 
the mortality signifi cantly. 
Sepsis causes millions of deaths globally each year.
[2]
In the United States, sepsis affects approximately 3 per 
1 000 people,
[3] and severe sepsis contributes to more 
than 200 000 deaths each year.[4] Sepsis occurs in 1%–2% 
of all hospitalized patients and accounts for as much as 
25% of ICU cases. Consensus on the treatment of sepsis 
indicates that early anti-infection treatment should be 
given before comprehensive treatment. However, due 
to the existence of non-infectious SIRS in many critical 
patients, how to differentiate sepsis from SIRS at the early 
stage has become a hot topic for many years. There are 
many reported biological markers such as procalcitonin 
(PCT), interleukins, pro-vasopressin, C-reactive protein 
(CRP) and myeloid cells expressing triggering receptor-1 
(TREM-1).[5–8] The studies of these biomarkers on 
sepsis concerning the diagnosis, assessment, antibiotic 
treatment, and prognosis have attracted extensive 
attention from researchers. Except PCT, however, the 
clinical values of the other biomarkers are still uncertain 
or controversial. In 2004, a new biomarker sCD14-
subtypes (presepsin) was found[9] and its value was shown 
in the diagnosis and evaluation of sepsis. This article will 
give a brief overview of this new biomarker.
BIOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS 
OF PRESEPSIN
CD14 is the receptor of lipopolysaccharide-lipopoly￾saccharide binding protein (LPS-LBP) complexes. With 
the help of thinositol lipid structure, the carboxyl terminus 
of the molecule anchors in cell membrane and transducts 
the endotoxin signal through the Toll-like receptor-4.[10]
A series of downstream tyrosine protein kinases and
mitogen-activated protein kinase are gradually activated 
including the nuclear transcription factor NF-κB, thus

leading to the release of cytokines such as tumor necrosis 
factor-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-8 and IL-6.[11] Subsequently, 
the activation of the secondary inflammatory cascade and 
acquired immunity stimulate mononuclear macrophages, 
neutrophils and endothelial cells to release more cytokines 
and cell adhesion molecules. This could trigger intense and 
excessive systemic infl ammatory response and activate the 
coagulation and fibrinolytic systems, resulting in SIRS, 
sepsis shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), 
and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome ( MODS).[12]
CD14 has two forms: membrane-bound CD14 (mCD14) 
and soluble CD14 (sCD14). The former has a high affi nity 
to LPS, and is mainly expressed on the cell surface of 
monocytes/macrophages or distributed a little bit on the 
cell surface of neutrophils. The latter is seen in plasma, and 
is produced by mCD14 fall-off or cell secretion.[13,14] Two 
kinds of sCD14 could be detected in the plasma of healthy 
people at microgram level: 49KD and 55KD. sCD14 plays 
an important role in mediating the immune responses to 
LPS of CD14-negative cells such as endothelial cells and 
epithelial cells. sCD14 is cleaved by cathepsin D and other 
proteases in plasma[15] and the N-terminal fragments of 
13kDa constitutes sCD14 subtype (sCD14-ST) which has 
been named as presepsin recently.[16]
ROLE OF PRESEPSIN IN SEPSIS
As a receptor of the LPS-LBP complex, CD14 could 
activate a series of signal transduction pathways and 
infl ammatory cascades, and lead to systemic infl ammatory 
response.
[17] Some clinical studies[18,19] on the relationship 
between sCD14 and sepsis showed that the level of sCD14 
increased significantly in patients with sepsis and septic 
shock compared with healthy people, and the change 
was significantly related to the severity and prognosis of 
the disease. The specificity of sCD14 was poor, and the 
level of sCD14 significantly increased in patients with 
coronary heart disease, heart failure, liver cirrhosis, high 
blood glucose and so on. Presepsin is generated as the 
body response to bacterial infection, and phagocytosis 
against bacteria may play a major role other than simply 
give an infl ammatory response,[15,20] although it is not clear 
about how presepsin is produced in the body. Researchers 
believe that presepsin is likely to be a sepsis diagnostic 
biomarker with a high sensitivity and specificity. Further 
studies have shown encouraging results.
DIAGNOSIS
Because of the better sensitivity and specificity,[21,22]
PCT, CRP and IL-6 are commonly used as biomarkers 
in the diagnosis of sepsis, while assessing the severity 
of infection and guiding the use of antibiotics. But meta￾analysis found that the sensitivity and specificity of 
PCT[23,24] and CRP[25] varied in the diagnosis of sepsis. The 
sensitivity of IL-6 was not high and declined gradually 
as the time of infection extended.[26] These findings 
questioned their ability to distinguish sepsis from SIRS.
Compared with the other markers, presepsin seems to
have a better sensitivity and specifi city in the diagnosis of 
sepsis. Studies[27,28] found that the plasma concentration 
of presepsin was signifi cantly higher in infected patients 
than in non-infected patients. Shozushima et al[20] found 
that the concentration of presepsin was 333.5±130.6
pg/mL in the SIRS group, 721.0±611.3 pg/mL in the 
local infection group, 817.9±572.7 pg/mL in the sepsis 
group, and 1 992.9±1 509.2 pg/mL in the severe sepsis 
group. The blood concentration of presepsin among the 
groups increased sequentially. Spanuth et al[21] studied 
the concentration of presepsin in emergency patients on 
admission, and they found that it was signifi cantly higher in 
sepsis patients than in healthy people, and also signifi cantly 
higher in severe sepsis patients than in sepsis patients. 
Moreover the concentration of presepsin was positively 
correlated with APACHE II score and SOFA score. When 
ROC curve was used to evaluate the value of the four 
markers in the diagnosis of sepsis, the AUC of presepsin 
was 0.845. Presepsin was preferred to PCT (0.652), IL-6 
(0.672), and CRP (0.815). With 399 pg/mL of presepsin 
as a cut-off value, the sensitivity of the diagnosis of sepsis 
was 80.3%, and the specificity was 78.5%. Whereas 600 
pg/mL was taken as a cut-off value, the sensitivity for 
the diagnosis of sepsis was 87.8%, the specificity 81.4%, 
the positive predictive value 88.6%, and the negative 
predictive value 80.3%.[20] The sensitivity of presepsin 
for the diagnosis of sepsis was 91.9%, PCT 89.9%, IL-6 
88.9%, and blood culture 35.4%.[27] The results suggest that 
presepsin may be advantageous in the diagnosis of sepsis.
Blood culture was performed for 48–72 hours to 
diagnose sepsis, but the positive rate was low. PCT
increased in 4 hours after infection, reached a plateau 
slowly at 8–24 hours, and peaked one day after infection. 
Compared with PCT, presepsin increased earlier and 
faster in patients with sepsis,[17] at 2 hours after infection 
in the CLP sepsis model, peaked at 3 hours, and declined 
at 4–8 hours.[29,30] It could be detected in the early stage 
of infection by using the ELISA method.
The rescue principles indicate that sepsis should 
be diagnosed early (the infection foci should be 
detected within 6 hours) and treated early (antibiotics 
treatment given within 1 hour after the diagnosis of

sepsis[29]). Clinically, sepsis biomarkers with a high 
sensitivity and specificity are required in addition to 
rapid detection methods. According to the principles of 
chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay, 21 minutes 
are taken for PATHFAST analysis to detect presepsin. 
The accuracy of this method is similar to that of ELISA; 
moreover in this detection, plasma, serum heparin, 
heparin whole blood, and EDTA anti-coagulated serum 
can be used as the detection samples.[30]
ASSESSMENT OF SEVERITY AND 
PROGNOSIS
Presepsin as a biomarker is not only suitable for the 
early diagnosis of sepsis, but also for the assessment of its 
severity and prognosis. In the ALBIOS trial, 100 patients 
with severe sepsis and septic shock were subjected to 
the assessment of the concentrations of presepsin and 
PCT. The median (Q1–Q3) concentration of presepsin was 
2 268 (1 145–4 305) pg/mL in dead patients the fi rst day 
on admission, which was signifi cantly higher than 1 184 
(855–2 158) pg/mL in surviving patients (P=0.001). On 
the 7th day, the presepsin level of the surviving patients 
declined significantly to 974 (674–1 927) pg/mL, and 
that of the dead patients was 2 551 (1 438–5 624) pg/mL 
(P=0.02). Moreover, the level of presepsin was correlated 
with SOFA score, MOF score and hemodynamic stability. 
The 90-day mortality in patients with a high level of 
presepsin was significantly higher than the patients with 
a low level of presepsin (75% and 42%). Presepsin was 
superior to PCT in the assessment of prognosis (AUC
0.69 and 0.56, P=0.07).[31] Another study showed that the 
level of presepsin was signifi cantly different between the 
survival group and the death group, even between the 
sepsis group, severe sepsis group and septic shock group. 
Presepsin was better than IL-6, CRP and PCT in assessing 
the risk of death within 30 days after onset of sepsis.[32]
When the cut-off value of presepsin was 1 622 pg/mL and 
the cut-off value of PCT 13.43 ng/mL in PCT group, 23% 
of the surviving patients could be allocated to the death 
group, 40% of the dead patients were assigned to the 
surviving patients. Combined with MEDS and presepsin 
could reclassify them into the correct groups, indicating 
that presepsin might have a better ability to predict the 
risk of death.[21]
DEFICIENCY
Preliminary studies have shown that presepsin is 
highly accurate and specific in the diagnosis of sepsis. 
It is fast and convenient to detect sepsis and to assess 
the severity and prognosis of sepsis; but as a receptor, 
LPS is a component of the gram-negative bacterial 
cell wall. It is easy to imagine whether presepsin is a 
predicator for sepsis caused by gram-positive cocci 
infection. Studies[27–30] have shown that the sensitivities 
of presepsin, PCT, and IL-6 were 95.5%, 95.5% and 
100% in patients with gram-positive bacterial infection, 
and 77.8%, 86.1% and 88.9% in gram-negative bacterial 
infection. The sensitivity of presepsin was not different 
significantly between patients with gram-positive and 
gram-negative bacterial infections. Additionally, the 
level of presepsin could be increased in patients with 
fungal infection, but not in patients with virus infection. 
There were no immediate reports on presepsin levels 
of patients with atypical pathogen infection but without 
mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. A recent study
[33]
has found that in patients with renal failure, the median 
levels of presepsin in patients with no sepsis (n=14) 
and those with sepsis (n=27) were 1 607 pg/mL (range 
454 to 8 516) and 1 523 pg/mL (range 293 to 16 764), 
respectively. There were no differences between the two 
groups. However, the median levels of presepsin were 
signifi cantly different in patients without sepsis and those 
with sepsis in non-AKI patients, risk patients, and injured 
patients. It was clear that the diagnosis of presepsin level 
was affected by the kidney function.
In summary, studies showed that presepsin has a 
higher sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of 
sepsis as a new biomarker, and is a predictor for the 
prognosis of sepsis. More importantly, preseptin seems to 
play a crucial role as a supplemental method in the early 
diagnosis of sepsis. Since there is no multicenter study 
on the relationship between presepsin and sepsis, further 
studies on the clinical values of presepsin are needed.
