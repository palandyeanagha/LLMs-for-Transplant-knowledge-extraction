Hepatitis E viral infection recently emerges as a global health concern. Over the last
decade, the understanding of hepatitis E virus (HEV) had changed with the discovery
of new genotypes like genotype-7 and genotype-8 with associated host and mode
of infection. Diversification in the mode of hepatitis E infection transmission through
blood transfusion, and organ transplants in contrast to classical feco-oral and zoonotic
mode is the recent medical concern. The wide spectrum of infection ranging from selflimiting to acute liver failure is now overpowered by HEV genotype-specific chronic
infection especially in transplant patients. This concern is further escalated by the extrahepatic manifestations of HEV targeting the central nervous system (CNS), kidney,
heart, and pancreas. However, with the development of advanced efficient cell culture
systems and animal models simulating the infection, much clarity toward understanding
the pathogenetic mechanism of HEV has been developed. Also this facilitates the
development of vaccines research or therapeutics. In this review, we highlight all the
novel findings in every aspect of HEV with special emphasis on recently emerging
chronic mode of infection with specific diagnosis and treatment regime with an optimistic
hope to help virologists and/or liver specialists working in the field of viral hepatitis.

INTRODUCTION
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is one of the leading causes of acute viral hepatitis (AVH) with worldwide
distribution. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) factsheet (2015), there have
been 20 million HEV infections annually causing 3.3 million symptomatic cases with ∼60,000
deaths due to viral hepatitis (Hakim et al., 2017; Nimgaonkar et al., 2018). Over the last decade,
the clinical and basic research on HEV pathogenesis has gone to such an extent that the European
Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) has recently released the clinical practice guidelines
on viral hepatitis E in 2018 (Dalton et al., 2018). Presently in developing countries, approximately
30% of the populations are being infected with HEV with mortality ranging from 0.2 to 1% in the
general population. Around 1–4% of AVH in the general population and 30% of acute liver failure
(ALF) in pregnant women are attributed to viral hepatitis E (Purcell and Emerson, 2008; Khuroo,
2011). About 50% of acute hepatitis, 30–45% of ALF and 30–70% sporadic hepatitis cases in the
Indian subcontinent are being attributed to infection (Kumar Acharya et al., 2007; Aggarwal and
Jameel, 2011) whereas 27–80% of HEV seroprevalence has been observed in the general population
in SE-Asian countries (Abe et al., 2006).

Thakur et al. Chronicity in HEV Infection
Traditionally HEV infection considered as acute, selflimited, and endemic to developing countries including the
Indian subcontinent, however, progression to chronicity,
resulting in liver damage and cirrhosis, has been reported
in immunocompromised patients with solid organ transplant
(SOT), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hematological
malignancies (Kamar et al., 2013a; Murali et al., 2015). This
review comprehensively describes the least understood extrahepatic manifestation of HEV infection, i.e., chronic hepatitis
E in-relation to susceptibility in different genotypes, clinical
profiling of patients with special emphasis on the treatment
regimen in SOT recipients with chronic HEV infection.
EMERGING HEV GENOTYPES AND
PREDILECTION TOWARD CHRONICITY
Hepatitis E virus is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus
with a 7.2 kb genome, divided into three open reading frames
(ORFs) except genotype-1 having an additional ORF4 (Figure 1;
Balayan et al., 1983). The 50 non-coding region is capped with
7-methylguanosine (7mG) and 30is polyadenylated [poly(A)].
Open reading frame 1 (ORF1) encodes for a polyprotein of
∼190 KDa comprising of non-structural proteins including
regions of unknown function [Y, proline-rich region (PRR), and
X] and methyltransferase (MT), cysteine protease (Pro), helicase
(Hel) and RNA polymerase (Pol). ORF2 and ORF3 are translated
from a subgenomic RNA of 2.2 Kb where ORF2 encodes for
capsid protein which becomes N-glycosylated at three sites.
The unique ORF4 encodes a protein that stimulates viral
RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) and promotes viral
replication. The life cycle of HEV includes various crucial steps
that initiate from the attachment of HEV to the heparin sulfate
proteoglycans followed by clathrin-mediated endocytosis and
release of viral RNA into the cytoplasm. The viral RNA encodes
for ORF1 protein followed by replication via negative-strand
RNA intermediated, synthesis of full-length and subgenomic
RNAs. Subgenomic RNAs undergo translation that yields ORF2
and ORF3 proteins followed by packaging, assembly, and release
of the newly generated virus. Pieces of evidence are suggesting
that ORF3 is associated with the release of HEV into the
bloodstream (Debing et al., 2016a).
Recently eight phylogenetically distinct genotypes (genotypes
1–8) within a single HEV serotype have been identified with
four genotypes (genotype 1–4) known to cause human infection
(Figure 2). All the isolated HEV strains from the Indian
subcontinent showed 82% sequence similarity whereas; the
Mexican strain showed 77% sequence similarity across the
entire genome, thereby suggested the possibility of two different
genotypes, i.e., HEV genotype-1 and genotype-2 (Smith et al.,
2016). Later, a novel HEV genotype-3 stain with 79–80%
sequence similarity was isolated from domestic swine (Meng
et al., 1997). Whereas, HEV genotype-4 has been discovered in
the sera of a Chinese patient with acute hepatitis (Wang et al.,
1999). Predominantly, HEV transmission is by the fecal-oral
route in endemic areas (genotype-1 and genotype-2), whereas
food-borne transmission is common in non-endemic developed
countries (genotype-3 and genotype-4) (Zhou et al., 2004). HEV5 and HEV-6 have only been identified in wild boars (Tei
et al., 2003). A recent discovery of camelid HEV in dromedary
camels from Dubai in 2014 and Bactrian camels from Xinjiang
in 2016 with more than 20% nucleotide difference proposed
HEV genotypes-7 and genotype-8, respectively (Hoofnagle et al.,
2012). Based on the analysis of nucleotide p-distances, HEV-1 was
identified to have six subtypes, whereas HEV-2, 3, and 4 have 2,
10, and 9 subtypes, respectively (Smith et al., 2016).
Among the existing eight genotypes, genotype-1 is more
virulent and responsible for high mortality in pregnant women
and genotype-3 has been exclusively reported in chronic hepatitis
E. However a case of persistent HEV infection with genotype4 was also reported in a child (Geng et al., 2014; Kamar et al.,
2012b). Similarly, HEV RNA and antigen was also detected in
a woman with nephritic syndrome infected with chronic HEV
genotype-4 (Geng et al., 2016). A very few case reports have also
been reported where transplant recipient patients were infected
with HEV genotype-1. So far, there is no chronic case reported
with HEV genotype-2, 5, 6, and 8.
Key factors which might be the player in the causation of
chronic infection are as follows:
1. HEV chronic cases are mostly reported with genotype-3
and genotype-4 and one case with genotype-7, as these
cases are mostly reported from the developed countries
with an increase in meat consumption pointing toward
the zoonotic mode of transmission of HEV chronicity.
2. Immunocompromised patients with an impaired state
of immunity have been identified as the high-risk
individuals developing chronic HEV infection.
3. High virulence in addition to the endemic nature of HEV
genotype-1 strain might further increase the chances of
chronic cases.
Following is a brief review of the HEV chronic cases reported
in the organ transplant recipient immunocompromised patients.
CHRONICITY IN
IMMUNOCOMPROMISED ORGAN
TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS
Generally, immunocompetent individuals develop a self-limiting
acute HEV infection which eventually subsides (Figure 3).
However in immunocompromised SOT patients (Kamar et al.,
2014a), over 60% of AVH infection progress to chronicity,
and 10% under-goes cirrhosis within 2 years (Haagsma et al.,
2009; Kamar et al., 2011a; Lhomme et al., 2012). Generally,
chronic hepatitis E infection is asymptomatic and causes liver
damage when it progresses to cirrhosis, and eventually, patients
succumb to death. Such patients are potent sources for HEV
transmission due to prolonged viremia and viral shedding in
feces, i.e., for more than 3 months. Since the first case of chronic
HEV infection reported in 2008 in liver transplant patients
(Unzueta and Rakela, 2014), to date, many studies reported the
immunopathology, clinical implication, and treatment regimen

Thakur et al. Chronicity in HEV Infection
FIGURE 1 | Genomic organization of HEV: Classically divided into three ORFs (ORF1, ORF2, and ORF3) except genotype-1 having an additional ORF4. HEV RNA is
transcribed into subgenomic RNA of ∼3.7 and ∼2 kb. The 50 non-coding region is capped with 7-methylguanosine (7mG) and 30is polyadenylated [poly(A)]. ORF1
encodes for non-structural proteins including MT, regions of unknown function (Y, PPR, and X), Pro, Hel, and Pol or RdRp. ORF2 codes for capsid protein and ORF3
is a multifunctional protein that helps in the release of virions from the infected cell.
FIGURE 2 | Schematic representation of HEV taxonomy: Hepeviridae family is classified into genera Orthohepevirus and Piscihepevirus. Orthohepevirus is
comprised of four species viz. Orthohepevirus-A, Orthohepevirus-B, Orthohepevirus-C, and Orthohepevirus-D based on the host range and sequence identities,
whereas Piscihepevirus genus includes only the Cutthroat trout virus (CTV). In Orthohepevirus-A species, eight genotypes were identified and designated as HEV
genotype (HEV-1 to HEV-8). Genotype-1 (six subtypes) and genotype-2 (two subtypes) are mainly confined to humans. However, genotype-3 (10 subtypes) and
genotype-4 (9 subtypes) infects swine but are also known to be transmitted to humans by the consumption of meat (zoonotic). Genotype-5 and genotype-6 are
identified in wild boars. Recently genotype-7 and genotype-8 were identified in the dromedary and Bactrian camel, respectively.
for these critically ill patients. Also, kidney, heart, and pancreas
transplant recipients with lymphoma and leukemia are more
likely to progress to chronicity (Kamar et al., 2008; Europe PMC,
2020). So, in such immunocompromised individuals, chronic
hepatitis E has now emerged as an important clinical problem
that needs to be addressed.
So far, the majority of the chronic HEV cases have been seen
with genotype-3 except for few reports of persistent infections
observed with genotype-1 and 4 (Geng et al., 2014). The
basic human pathogenetic mechanisms behind chronicity in
immunocompromised state and SOTs are not well understood,
however, the immuno-suppressants might be playing some role.

Thakur et al. Chronicity in HEV Infection
FIGURE 3 | Clinical manifestations, and immune response in HEV infection: On contact with the hepatitis E virus, individuals may undergo asymptomatic clearance
owing to innate immunity and neutralizing antibody. Symptomatic immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals with hepatitis E viral infection present as
acute hepatitis E, which is usually a self-limiting form of disease providing long term protection due to HEV specific T cell memory and neutralizing antibody. Acute
liver failure due to high HEV load and associated inflammatory cytokines. In immunocompromised patients, the presence of HEV RNA for more than 3 months,
results in chronic HEV infection, possibly attributed by the quasi-species evolution in HEV and impaired T cell response.
In a remarkable study, the progression of 8 of the 14 HEV
infected SOT recipients have been reported to chronicity which
was inclusive of all three liver transplant recipients (Kamar et al.,
2008). This suggests that HEV chronicity is most common among
liver transplant recipients and is observed in low frequency
across the globe (Kamar et al., 2011a; Unzueta and Rakela,
2014). Similarly, a case of HEV chronic hepatitis leading to
progressive cirrhosis and death in a liver transplant recipient
has been reported to receive a liver from an occult HEV
infected donor (Schlosser et al., 2012). Similarly in a prospective
study on 287 orthotopic liver transplant recipients (OLT), four
chronic HEV infected patients with enlarged densely infiltrated
portal tracts with interface hepatitis were identified (Galante
et al., 2015). A 3-month short regimen with ribavirin (400–
800 mg/day) is effective in these patients. Agarwala et al. (2018)
reported the absence of HEV viremia in a cohort of 30 liver
transplant recipients till the 6 months post-transplant followup, despite 20% seropositivity. Similarly, a cohort of studies
by Naik et al. (2013) and Munjal et al. (2014) demonstrated
no viremia in a cohort of 205 renal transplant recipients
since transplantation and no detectable HEV RNA in 49 renal
transplant recipients, respectively. These observations suggest to
us the limited potential of the circulating HEV genotype-1 to
cause chronic infections in the Indian population.
Interestingly a unique case of chronic HEV infection by
genotype-7 was reported by Lee et al. (2016) in a liver transplant
recipient which probably due to the consumption of camel
meat and milk. In 2020 Japanese nationwide study of HEV
infection on 99 heart and 2526 kidney transplant recipients
revealed HEV RNA positivity in 1 heart (1.01%) and 11 (0.44%)

Thakur et al. Chronicity in HEV Infection
kidney transplant recipients with the dominance of genotype3, wherein four patients developed chronic hepatitis E posttransplantation (Owada et al., 2020). Chronic HEV might explain
many cases of otherwise unexplained post-transplant hepatitis
or cryptogenic cirrhosis. A case report by Kurihara et al.
(2016) described a 41-year-old patient who had cirrhosis of
the liver due to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and hepatocellular
carcinoma before liver transplant. However post-liver transplant,
the recipient was infected with HEV through blood transfusion
later progressed to chronicity and was also treated with ribavirin
therapy (800 mg/day for 20 weeks). Halac et al. (2012a) studied
a cohort of 14 children who had undergone OLT and found
that 86% of them had anti-HEV IgG post-OLT. However, one
case presented with anti-HEV IgG, IgM, and HEV RNA in
different samples collected during and after 8 years of OLT.
The most unusual finding revealed was the presence of two
different phylogenetically established HEV strains (genotype-3)
causing re-infection leading to chronic hepatitis which eventually
progresses to fibrosis and cirrhosis.
Waldenström et al. (2015) reported chronic HEV infection by
genotype-3 in a 63-year-old Swedish heart transplant recipient
who received blood from the 17 donors. A long-term follows up
of HEV infection in 446 renal transplant recipients were studied
by Sridhar et al. (2018), where four patients (0.9%) developed
anti-HEV IgM, of them three progressed to chronic hepatitis E
with HEV RNA positivity which was attributed to consumption
of undercooked pig products and genotype-4 was confirmed
by phylogenetic analysis. They were on prednisolone and
everolimus as immunosuppressive prophylaxis, however, later
treated with ribavirin (400 mg twice daily). A novel HEV-3 strain
(SW/16-0282) showing 87.8% homology with HEV genotype3h TR19 strain was also reported from kidney transplant
recipient with chronic hepatitis E from Switzerland (Wang et al.,
2017). In six heart transplant recipients, on immunosuppression
with tacrolimus and prednisolone combination, elevated liver
enzymes with RNA positivity by HEV genotype-3 were reported
(Koning et al., 2013). The first case of chronic HEV genotype4, in the renal transplant recipient, was reported from China
(Wang et al., 2018). A unique case of a 33-year-old man
with ileocolonic Crohn’s disease, acquired chronic HEV due to
genotype-1, following a trip to India. This rare case was treated by
reducing the doses of prednisolone, followed by a 24-week course
of ribavirin (600 mg twice daily) which lowered the HEV viral
load. This case has important implications for travelers who are
immunocompromised and are traveling to HEV endemic areas
of the world (Robins et al., 2018). Recently, a case of chronic
hepatitis E with genotype-1 was reported in a post liver transplant
patient with previous compensated cryptogenic cirrhosis (Rathi
et al., 2020), necessarily warranting to focus on chronic hepatitis
E of different genotypes in different countries.
HEV CHRONICITY AND EXTRAHEPATIC
MANIFESTATIONS
Hepatitis E infection has been associated with a wide spectrum
of extra-hepatic, mainly neurological, renal, cardiac, and
hematological manifestations (Fousekis et al., 2020; Figure 4).
HEV also has been detected in the human placenta, breast milk,
and urine (Pischke et al., 2017; Rivero-Juarez et al., 2019).
Neurological: HEV is associated with neuronal damage in the
form of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), neuralgic amyotrophy
(NA), encephalitis, myositis, and Bell’s palsy (Dalton et al.,
2016). More than 150 cases with HEV genotype-3 have
been reported from Europe. However, the majority (∼90%)
of the documented cases are immuno-competent which is
different from immunocompromised organ transplant recipients.
Prevalence of acute hepatitis E in patients with GBS was found
to be in the range of 4–8% in various studies, i.e., Netherlands
(5%), Japan (4.8%), and Belgium (8%) (Stevens et al., 2017).
From a European multicentric study involving 118 NA patients,
an unusual clinical presentation like bilateral involvement and
damage to brachial plexus and phrenic nerve in patients with
HEV associated NA was observed by Van Eijk et al. (2017).
Interestingly, HEV RNA could also be detected in cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) of them indicating the central nervous system (CNS)
involvement. A case of HEV infected male with high liver
function tests (LFTs) and a triad of bilateral shoulder pain
has also been reported in single centric research (Dalton and
Seghatchian, 2016). Besides, 5.5% (7/126) of the patients with
acute and chronic HEV infection had developed neurologic
manifestations in a study by Kamar et al. (2011b). Moreover, four
immunocompromised patients had chronic hepatitis E infection
with genotype-3, of which three were SOT recipients, while
one had HEV-HIV co-infection. All the infected patients had
neuronal damage such as encephalitis, peripheral demyelinating
polyneuropathy, and associated cognitive dysfunction.
Renal manifestations like membranoproliferative
glomerulonephritis and cryoglobulinemia are common
with HEV infected patients. Membranoproliferative
glomerulonephritis and IgA nephropathy relapses were
noted in SOT recipients with acute and chronic HEV
infection (Kamar et al., 2012a). Similarly, Ali et al. (2001)
documented membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and
membranous glomerulonephritis in both immunocompetent
and immunosuppressed patients, infected with HEV genotype-1
and genotype-3, respectively. HEV RNA has been also detected in
cryoprecipitate obtained from HEV infected cryoglobulinaemic
glomerulonephritis patients (Guinault et al., 2016). A case of
nephrotic syndrome associated with chronic HEV infection
was reported in a kidney transplant recipient, which was
completely resolved after the introduction of ribavirin therapy
(Taton et al., 2013).
Hematological manifestations like different patterns of anemia
(hemolytic, autoimmune hemolytic, and aplastic) (Leaf et al.,
2017) have been reported during HEV infection. Severe
thrombocytopenia has been described in patients with acute HEV
genotype-1 and genotype-3 infections. In 25% of the patients
infected with HEV genotype-3, monoclonal paraprotein has been
documented (Woolson et al., 2014).
Rheumatologic manifestations such as arthralgia, myalgia,
skin rashes, and cryoglobulinemia have been reported in
chronic HEV infected liver transplant recipients (Pischke et al.,
2014). In a study with solid organ recipient suffered from

FIGURE 4 | Schematic representation of extra-hepatic manifestations of HEV infection: Myocarditis and acute pancreatitis are the HEV associated manifestations of
heart and pancreas. The major neurological and hematological manifestations are Guillain Barre syndrome, Bell’s palsy, neuralgic amyotrophy, thrombocytopenia,
hemolytic, and aplastic anemia. Cryoglobulinemia is attributed by renal, whereas polyarthritis is associated with skeletal-related HEV manifestations.
HEV, 52.9% prevalence of cryoglobulinemia was reported
(Marion et al., 2019).
HEV CHRONICITY IN CO-INFECTIONS
AND HEMATOLOGICAL MALIGNANCIES
Hepatitis E virus chronic infection has also been reported in
patients who were already affected by hepatitis B virus (HBV),
hepatitis C virus (HCV), HIV, and chronic liver diseases. Studies
have shown that HEV super-infection in patients with chronic
liver disease (CLD) leads to liver decompensation.
The first case of dual chronic HEV-HIV infection was reported
by Dalton et al. (2009) in a 48 years old male patient having
low (<200) CD4 count and abnormal transaminases with pieces
of evidence of cirrhosis and inflammation on liver biopsy. The
development of cirrhosis was found to be the main concern in
HIV/HEV co-infection. Despite anti-retroviral treatment, HEV
RNA in serum persisted for 18 months, possibly due to severe
immunosuppression and low CD4 count. The prevalence of
chronic HEV-HIV dual infection is <0.5% from Europe and
Australia, where the cases had consistently low CD count of
<200 (Colson et al., 2011; Kaba et al., 2011; Jagjit Singh et al.,
2013; Yong et al., 2014). Among the 3000 HIV positive patients,
one had chronic HEV infection reported from the United States
(Kuniholm et al., 2016). Further studies are hence needed to
address whether infection or exposure to HEV plays a role in
the development of liver fibrosis in HIV-infected individuals. Coinfections with hepatotropic viruses including HCV and HBV
have been described to mediate flares of liver disease causing
more damage (Sagnelli et al., 2014). HEV super-infection in 10
CLD patients has also been identified by Monga et al. (2004),
of which five were alcoholics, two were cryptogenic, and HBV
positive whereas one was positive for HCV. Such varied coinfections might suppress immunity leading to chronic HEV.
Cancer patients especially, hematological are on heavy
immunosuppression, therefore frequently prone to other
infections. HEV genotype-3 chronicity in four French chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients who were earlier exposed
to ibrutinib and rituximab have been reported (Open Forum
Infectious Diseases Oxford Academic, 2020). This hematological
complication was treated successfully with the administration
of ibrutinib and ribavirin (median 600 mg ribavirin daily,
8 mg/kg) combination, considering the anemic status. Despite
on ribavirin therapy for 3–9 months, three patients were
succumbed to death due to underlying disease, while one
continued on ibrutinib. Oilier et al. (2009) reported a case of
chronic hepatitis E in a 77-year-old male with non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma who was on rituximab. Usually, a 3-month course
of ribavirin induces sustained HEV reduction in patients
with hematological malignancies (Tavitian et al., 2015). In
a Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL) patient, HEV reactivation and viremia till
fourteen weeks after allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) has
been reported (Le Coutre et al., 2009). This reactivation may
be attributed to immunosuppression or ALL relapse, however,
these consequences are common in patients receiving stem
cell transplantation and chemotherapy (Tavitian et al., 2010).
Frontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 6 September 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 577339

Thakur et al. Chronicity in HEV Infection
In a retrospective study on 328 allogeneic hematopoietic SCT
recipients, 8 (2.4%) HEV RNA positive and five chronic hepatitis
cases with four deaths have been reported (Versluis et al., 2013).
In a child recovered from acute leukemia, the progression of
chronic HEV genotype-1 infection toward CLD has been found
(NCBI, 2020). In hematological malignancies, the development
of cirrhosis has been described in pediatrics marrow transplant
patients within 2 years of infection (Halac et al., 2012b).
CHRONICITY IN PREGNANT WOMEN
In pregnant women, the rate of mortality is around 25%,
primarily due to fulminant hepatic failure. High perinatal
mortality is associated with obstetric complications like
preeclampsia and hemorrhage (Kamar et al., 2012b). In
pregnancy, chronic hepatitis is stated as epiphenomenal due to
temporary perturbation of immunity. In developing countries,
high mortality in pregnant women was attributed to virulent
HEV genotype-1 strain. However, only a few cases were
reported in developed countries due to acute HEV genotype-3
(Mallet et al., 2013; Tabatabai et al., 2014). A case of chronic
autochthonous HEV genotype-3c infected pregnant women,
who were on immunosuppressive agents for ulcerative colitis
(infliximab and azathioprine) was reported (Charre et al.,
2018). Despite high HEV load (6.9 log10 copies/ml), the
vertical transmission was not reported in the baby, indicating
that chronic HEV-3 infection might resolve after pregnancy
due to reduced T-cell response and innate immunity. From
the study of chronic HEV in a pig model (Cao et al., 2017)
Th1/Th2 imbalance has been proposed as the crucial host
factor mediating progression toward HEV chronicity during the
immunocompromised state.
HEV INFECTION AND CHRONICITY IN
PEDIATRIC AND YOUNG POPULATION
Hepatitis E virus infection in children and the pediatric
population is usually asymptomatic; however, the symptoms
might mimic with viral hepatitis A which is supposed to be
common in children and younger age groups. Symptomatic
HEV infection is uncommon in children even during large HEV
epidemics. Since it is uncommon in the pediatric age group, so
also the ALF which reflects the paucity of data on chronic HEV
in Childhood (Fischler et al., 2016).
The literature showed the positive relationship of HEV
seropositivity with advancing age (Meng et al., 2015). Few
studies available indicate low HEV seropositivity in the pediatric
age groups (5%) under the 10 years (Bayhan et al., 2016) in
Turkey and Morocco whereas 4.2% positivity was observed in
children between 2 and 18 years in the province of Van, Turkey
(Atabek et al., 2004). Even in a large worldwide survey in early
childhood revealed HEV seroprevalence in less than 10% in
children up to 10 years of age and less than 5% in European
children (Verghese and Robinson, 2014). The Dutch pediatric
study found a seroprevalence of 3.2% in liver/kidney transplant
patients in contrast to immunocompetent patients with 7.4%
positivity (Hoerning et al., 2012). In a retrospective study from
France on 96 children who had undergone liver transplants, eight
patients (8.3%) were HEV seropositive with one reported case of
chronic cytolysis.
Mexican study on 99 pediatric patients, revealed the presence
of HEV genotype-3 with 3 and 6%, HEV IgG, and HEV
IgM seropositivity, respectively (López-Santaella et al., 2020).
In Japan, 3.3% of children with acute HEV hepatitis and
2.6% of the general population are HEV IgG positive (Okano
et al., 2020). Conditions like Thalassemia facilitate HEV related
chronicity, thereby increased the risk of morbidity as evidenced
by Abdelmawla et al. (2019), where anti-HEV IgG and HEV IgM
positivity was 24.29 and 2.86%, respectively, among thalassemic
children. Similarly, studies from Scandinavia (Psichogiou et al.,
1996) and Saudi Arabia (Al-Fawaz et al., 1996) showed 2.4
and 10.7% HEV antibody seroprevalence in thalassemic patients
respectively. In Germany, 4.6% of anti-HEV IgG prevalence
is reported in the pediatric population (Buti et al., 2008),
whereas liver transplant children had 3.2–15% seroprevalence
(Halac et al., 2012a). In general chronic HEV is seen with less
than 2% cases of transplants. One pediatric patient developed
HEV-induced liver cirrhosis after hematological stem cell
transplantation (Halac et al., 2012a). In an isolated cohort study
of 90 pediatric renal allograft recipients had 13.3%, (12/90) HEV
IgG positivity with 4.4% (4/90) recipients had HEV genotype3 active replication and further leading to chronicity (Cordts
et al., 2018). Thus from the available world literature, it is evident
that children less frequently get affected with HEV and seldom
develop chronicity.
HEPATITIS E AS A CAUSE OF
ACUTE-ON-CHRONIC LIVER FAILURE
Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is an acute event
associated with 50–90% mortality in general and 70% in HEVACLF cases. HEV acting as a potential trigger of ACLF is a
matter of great concern with relevant clinical implications. The
severity of liver damage may be associated with the infecting
genotype. HEV genotype-3 has been reported to induce ACLF in
elderly men or patients with underlying CLD (Péron et al., 2007;
Kumar and Saraswat, 2013). Studies from China and the Indian
subcontinent (Oilier et al., 2009), reveal a far worse outcome with
HEV genotype-1 or 2, however, composite mortality was reported
as up to 67% with a median of 34% (Kumar and Saraswat,
2013). ACLF manifestations range from acute deterioration
of liver functions to ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and/or
hepatic coagulopathy. Blasco-Perrin et al. (2015) identified 3%
(n = 11/343) patients with decompensated liver disease associated
with acute HEV infection and three deaths in the British/French
population. From an Indian study on 368 cases of ACLF, a
12% incidence rate for HEV associated infections was reported
but mortality in such cases was lower in comparison to other
ACLF etiologies (Shalimar Kedia et al., 2017a,b). In West African
countries, ACLF is not common due to acute HEV infection
(Shimakawa et al., 2016). Jagadisan et al. (2012) studied a subset

Thakur et al. Chronicity in HEV Infection
of 36 children with CLD superimposed with an acute hepatic
insult due to HEV in 27 (75%) children and observed that 17
of them are under ACLF category. High seroprevalence of antiHEV antibody in a case-control study involving 109 patients with
CLD indicating association between HEV infection and advanced
stage of CLD has been identified (Kondili et al., 2006). HEV is
considered as one of the common causes of ACLF in patients
with chronic HBV infection in HEV endemic areas. Zhang et al.
(2017) observed 60% HEV infected patients with underlying liver
diseases specifically with chronic HBV infection (40%), lead to
more severity. In a kidney transplant recipient from France,
47% of chronification has been reported with overt hepatitis
E infection (Lee et al., 2016). Generally, 20–50% of transplant
recipients following HEV infection develop chronic infection.
According to the study by Gupta and Lama (2017), acute HEV
infection accounts for over 20% of ACLF cases in Asian countries.
As per “Asia Pacific Association for Study of Liver” (APASL),
ACLF is defined as “acute hepatic insult manifesting as
jaundice (bilirubin >5 mg/dl) and coagulopathy (International
normalized ratio, INR >1.5), complicated within 4 weeks
by ascites and/or hepatic encephalopathy in a patient with
previously diagnosed or undiagnosed chronic liver disease” (Sarin
et al., 2019). Superadded HEV infection is a common cause of
ACLF in India (Ramachandran et al., 2004; Kumar et al., 2008).
A study by Gawande et al. (2019), on 208 patients with ACLF
showed a 13.94% contribution by viral hepatitis of which 7.2%
exclusively with HEV which acts as precipitating factor for ACLF.
In chronic HBV infected patients, HEV super-infection has
an enormous contribution toward ACLF progression (El Sayed
Zaki and Othman, 2011). Li et al. (2020) observed that 34.7%
(67/193) chronic HBV infected patients had developed ACLF
following acute HEV infection and 44.8% (30/67) of them had
a poor prognosis. This suggests that HEV super-infection with
genotype-3 upon HBV or underlying diseases is a precipitating
event to initiate ACLF in patients. Other studies from around
the world describing the impact of HEV infection as CLD or/and
ACLF manifestations were described in Table 1.
ANIMAL MODELS FOR CHRONIC
HEPATITIS E
To elucidate the pathogenetic mechanism, the reason
behind high severity in pregnant patients associated with
genotype-1, chronicity in transplant recipients and to develop
an effective vaccine, permissive, and highly efficient cell
culture system and/or suitable animal model is the utmost
requirement (Table 2).
So far, human lung carcinoma (A549) and human Hepatoma
(PLC/PRF/5) cell lines have shown better permissibility for HEV,
replicative efficiency, and viral load till seven passages (Emerson
et al., 2004). Suitable animal models are imperative to understand
the immunopathogenesis of Chronic HEV.
In the Western countries, HEV genotype-3 infections
are predominant in immunocompromised patients due to
zoonotic mode of transmission. To simulate the chronic
course of the disease, a rabbit model (Japanese white rabbits)

van de Garde et al. (2016), This small but novel model was
prepared by using plasma/fecal samples from eight HEV
genotype-3 infected immunocompromised patients to examine
the HEV genotype-3 infectivity in samples of different clinical
origins and also to develop 100% chronic HEV infection.
Similar humanized liver mouse models for chronic HEV-1 and
HEV-3 were also developed (Sayed et al., 2016). Small mouse
models were easy to handle and care, but are not a natural
host of HEV. However, the large mammal-like Cynomologus
monkey represents the close ancestor relationship with humans.
HEV infection has been successfully induced in Cynomolgus
monkeys using HEV RNA-positive urine samples and unravels
the potential relationship between HEV infection and kidney
disease (Geng et al., 2016). However, due to large size and
other ethical issues, relatively small and easy to handle animals
have been tried for developing chronic HEV infection models.
In this line, using swine HEV-4 strain, HEV susceptible
rabbit model has been developed for chronic HEV-4 infection
(Ma et al., 2010).
The most interesting fact is that none of the available models,
i.e., mouse, rabbit, or monkey are neither the natural host
nor they induce chronic infection with any of the known
HEV genotypes (Meng, 2010). Swine/pig is recognized as the
major reservoir and important zoonotic mode of HEV-3 and
HEV-4 transmission to humans. This correlation indicates
that pig could be the best model for studying cross-species
infection and mimicking chronic hepatitis E infection in
immunocompromised patients. So, an immunosuppression state
in a pig model has been successfully developed by infecting
with HEV genotype-3 strain and pre-post treatment with
cyclosporine, azathioprine, and prednisolone and observed active
suppression of HEV specific cell-mediated immune (CMI)
responses (Cao et al., 2017). This observation might be the reason
facilitating the establishment of chronic HEV infection in the
immunosuppressed transplant recipients.
These unique animal models for chronic HEV infection
might greatly improve our ability to study HEV infectivity by
understanding transmission dynamics and delineate underlying
pathogenic mechanisms causing chronicity which might lead to
the development of specific and effective antiviral drugs and
therapeutics against chronic hepatitis E.
DETERMINANTS/PREDICTORS OF
CHRONICITY IN HEV INFECTION
Hepatitis E virus infection is diagnosed as chronic hepatitis when
replicative HEV RNA persists in serum/stool until 3–6 months
after the original infection (Kamar et al., 2011a). Narayanan et al.
(2019) discussed the viral and host factors as determinants of
chronicity in HEV infection.
Viral Factors
The most important factors are viral genotype, zoonotic potential,
specificity, and adaptability for a host. HEV genotype-3 is the
predominant strain for chronicity with variability showing more
clinically apparent disease with genotype 3f then genotype 3c
(Lhomme et al., 2012). Few cases of chronic infection with
HEV-1 and 4 are reported, but none form HEV-2. Also, the
zoonotic potential of HEV-3 is high due to the animal reservoir
and zoonotic mode of transmission. Quasi-nature of HEV
may be associated with the development of chronicity, due
to diversification in the ORF2 region. Re-infections either by
two different strains of the same genotype (3c and 3e) or two
different genotypes (genotype-3 and 4) have been documented
in organ transplant recipients by zoonotic transmission (Moal
et al., 2012). Tropism for extra-hepatic organs like CNS, kidney,
placenta, and replicative fitness for developing chronic infection
may be attributed to short human-sequence insertion in HEV
RNA (Shukla et al., 2011). HEV tries to evade innate and
adaptive immunity by ORF3 mediated down-regulation of ISG
expression and by glycosylation of surface proteins, respectively.
The very unusual property of having envelope while circulating
in bloodstream as free virions help the virus in efficient
replication and also aid in non-specific uptake by different cell
types (Feng and Lemon, 2014). These viral factors by different
mechanisms increase the propensity for chronic infection in HEV
infected patients.
Host Factors
Host immunity in the form of innate, cell-mediated, or
humoral has been playing a crucial role in clearing the
infection and protecting the host. Low-level expression of tumor
Frontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 10 September 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 577339

Thakur et al. Chronicity in HEV Infection
necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 receptor agonist
(IL-Ra) were reported in organ transplant recipients developing
chronic HEV infection. Reduction in natural killer (NK) cell
counts explains the possible susceptibility to chronic infection.
Significant low count of CD2, CD3, CD4 T cells, and increased
serum concentration of chemokines such as regulated upon
activation, normal T cell expressed and presumably secreted
(RANTES), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP-1), CXCLB,
and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) (leukocyte
recruiters) were described as predictors of HEV chronicity in
organ transplant recipients (Kamar et al., 2008, 2011a). Further
in such patients, reduction in the levels of soluble interleukin-2
receptor (IL-2R) reflected the impaired T-cell response. Among
the T-helper (Th) arm of the immune response, Th2 response
mediates HEV infection toward chronicity by increased secretion
of IL-10 (Moal et al., 2012; Suneetha et al., 2012).
The immune-state and nutritional health of the patients
also decide the course of HEV infection. Immunocompromised
and suppressed state of pregnancy, especially when infected
with virulent HEV-1 strain, contributed to severe outcomes
possibly by Th2 bias. Serum cytokine levels and micronutrient
status also plays a role in the susceptibility (Hoofnagle et al.,
2012). Even the type of immunosuppressive regimen is used
to influence the likelihood of chronicity (Kamar et al., 2008).
Patients on immunosuppression like tacrolimus, everolimus
[mammalian target of rapamycin, (mTOR inhibitor)], rituximab
(B cell modulator), and methotrexate (TNF-α modulator)
are more prone to chronic HEV infection. Other crucial
predictors/factors are iatrogenic transmissions especially by
infected blood transfusion in an immunosuppressed patient.
Therefore testing of solvent treated plasma for the presence
of HEV by nucleic acid amplification test (NAT) is of prime
significance to avoid chronic HEV infection in the blood
recipients. Conclusively, greater HEV quasi-species diversity and
impaired immune response collectively seem to play a crucial role
in the development of chronic HEV infection.
DIAGNOSTIC AND TREATMENT
REGIMEN FOR CHRONIC HEPATITIS E
Early diagnosis in any infectious disease is the prime factor
to limit the progression, thereby increasing the chances of
survival by implementing early treatment interventions. In
chronic HEV infection, detection of HEV RNA either in serum
and/or in stool samples by reverse transcriptase-polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) for a minimum 3–6 month time
duration is the reference test for the confirmatory diagnosis
(Kamar et al., 2013b). Targeting conserved ORF2 region and
using NAT-based HEV RNA assay enhanced the analytical
sensitivity and specificity of HEV diagnosis (Baylis et al., 2013).
An OD450/630 of >15 in antigen assay is the indicator of
chronic hepatitis E and can differentiate with acute infection,
(PubMed, 2020) but this does not necessarily represent the
presence of infectious virions. Detection of IgG and IgM
antibodies against HEV in serum is futile as they are undetectable
due to immunosuppression (Pischke et al., 2010). Elevated
transaminases usually reflect damage in the liver, however,
patients who progressed to chronicity have been found relatively
lower transaminases alanine aminotransferase, (ALT) ∼300 vs
1000 IU/L) in comparison to acute infection (Murali et al., 2015).
Persistence of HEV RNA between 3 and 6 months in serum/stool
samples of HEV acquired transplant recipients has been reported
(Kamar et al., 2008). This suggested that the RNA persistence in
chronic HEV infections beyond 3 months so, in chronic cases,
HEV viral load needs to be detected henceforth to evaluate
antiviral and/or immunosuppressive drug response in patients
for planning an effective treatment regimen.
Currently, there is no established HEV-specific therapeutic
protocol; however antiviral such as ribavirin and interferon like
pegylated IFN have been used for the treatment of chronic
hepatitis E with some success (Lee et al., 2015; Ding et al., 2017).
In 2018, the EASL published guidelines, recommended the use
of ribavirin as a standard antiviral for HEV treatment however,
the optimal ribavirin treatment regimen is not known (Dalton
et al., 2018). It does not increase the risk of rejection, thereby can
be used in the patients where immunosuppressive agents cannot
be decreased. Ribavirin 50-monophosphate (active ribavirin)
inhibits HEV RNA replication indirectly by inhibiting inosine
monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) and subsequently
depleting guanosine-50-triphosphate (GTP) pool (Paeshuyse
et al., 2011). Mallet et al. (2010) studied the use of ribavirin
(12 mg/kg/day) in one with idiopathic CD4 T lymphocytopenia
and other with dual organ transplant (kidney and pancreas)
patient for 12 weeks and observed the clearance of HEV RNA
from serum/stool by 4th week of treatment which remained
undetectable till 12 weeks follow-up. A CLL patient with chronic
hepatitis E infection was treated with the highest recommended
dose of ribavirin (1000 mg) and showed sustained virological
response (SVR) for 24 weeks (Giordani et al., 2013), however in
another report; an SCT patient infected with chronic hepatitis
E viral infection was unable to survive, even with high dose
(800 mg) of ribavirin (Bettinger et al., 2015). Even from two
different studies, different SVR responses were observed with
ribavirin in transplant recipient patients (Kamar et al., 2010a,
2014b). In one study, with 600–800 mg ribavirin dose for
3 months protect four recipients with SVR of 6 months, whereas
in other studies on 59 transplant patients, 600 mg ribavirin
for 3 months provides 78% (SVR 6 months) response. Another
study showed the 9/11 SVR in 11 transplant patients who
were on ribavirin (600–100 mg) for 5 months (Pischke et al.,
2013). In addition to ribavirin therapy, reduction in the dose
of immunosuppressive drugs targeting T cells should be the
first intervention to help in virus clearance in chronic HEV
infected immunocompromised and transplant recipient patients.
Pegylated IFN-γ alone and/or in combination with ribavirin
has also succeeded in the treatment of chronic HEV-HIV dual
infection (Dalton et al., 2011; Jagjit Singh et al., 2013). In a study
by Kamar et al. (2010b) administration of 135 mcg/week dose
of pegylated IFN-alpha 2a to three liver transplant patients with
HEV chronicity for 12 weeks, resulting in clearance of HEV viral
RNA in serum and stool. A combined and cumulative effect
of reduction in immunosuppressive therapy, interferon therapy,
and ribavirin monotherapy for 8 weeks, resulted in the absence of

Thakur et al. Chronicity in HEV Infection
HEV RNA and IgM antibodies in a 55-year-old man infected with
chronic HEV genotype-3f post 26 months of OLT (Klein et al.,
2015). In two different studies involving SOT and SCT recipients
treated with ribavirin, high lymphocyte count is an independent
predictor and 66% (9/12) achieved SVR (Kamar et al., 2014b;
Tavitian et al., 2015), respectively. Other known antiviral, i.e.,
sofosbuvir was also reported to show a reduction in HEV viral
load but failed to achieve SVR in seven chronic HEV infected
patients (Cornberg et al., 2019). Personalized therapy could be
the priority of further research. Predictive formula based on host
clinical features like underlying disease, type and quantity of
immunosuppressive agents, viral load in blood/stool, and liver
fibrosis could be considered for patient management.
Hepatitis E Vaccines
With the concern of graft rejection, immunosuppressant therapy
is effective only in 30% HEV patients. In addition to antiviral,
the HEV vaccine could be the possible option for treating severe
and chronic HEV infection. Hecolin is the first and the only
vaccine produced by China, however, it is not approved yet
for the commercialization, even though the three doses of the
vaccine showed 100% efficacy in phase III clinical trial. With
the efficacy of 86.8% up to 4.5 years follow-up, no vaccination
associated serious adverse effect during the 12 months followup post-vaccine administration was reported (Zhu et al., 2010;
Murali et al., 2015). Despite promising results, the safety and
efficacy profile in chronic and other vulnerable populations is not
clear and needs further studies before recommendations for its
worldwide production and use.
Management of Chronic Hepatitis
So, based on the available data, the following algorithm should
practice in the management and treatment of chronic hepatitis
E (Figure 5), considering other clinical complications in the
record too. First, screening for HEV RNA should be considered
in immunocompromised patients, organ transplant recipients,
and patients with unexplained hepatitis and cryptogenic
cirrhosis to ascertain HEV infection. Second, a decrease in
immunosuppression (if feasible) in transplant patients, to a
level sufficient to allow for humoral and cellular immunity
FIGURE 5 | Algorithm for management of chronic hepatitis E viral infection: Chronic HEV infection in immunosuppressed patients is very common due to
immunosuppressed state, wherever possible immunosuppressive doses need to be modulated as per the chronicity of the disease. However, in both the states, if
HEV RNA persists for more than 3 months in serum and/or stool, ribavirin monotherapy for 3 months duration is the recommended treatment regimen. Such
patients on treatment may be either non-responders to ribavirin therapy or clear the virus post-therapy. In a few cases, after ceasing the ribavirin therapy, relapse
does occur, which is further treated with extended 6 months ribavirin monotherapy. Individuals who are non-responders or cases with HEV relapse, administration of
pegylated interferon helps in the clearance of HEV viral infection and recovery of patients (Dalton et al., 2018).
Frontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 12 September 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 577339

Thakur et al. Chronicity in HEV Infection
to curb HEV infection, should be the prime intervention
in the management of chronic hepatitis E infection. Third,
in the absence of adequate response, ribavirin therapy (600–
800 mg/day for 3 months) should be the medication of choice.
Fourth, in extreme cases, the HEV vaccine should be considered
in patients undergoing immunosuppression as an effective
treatment therapy.
CONCLUSION
Since the discovery of the HEV in 1978, this has been
neglected for a few decades and is considered as infection
of developing countries only. However, in the last decade or
so, an upsurge of HEV infections from around the world
including developed nations too, classify HEV infection as the
emerging which is now the prime health concern. Identification
of new HEV genotypes, i.e., genotype-4, 5, 6, and, 7 in
different animal reservoirs and hosts like boars, pigs, and
camels from different geographical locations increases the mode
and probability of cross-species infection. In addition to this,
blood transfusion, organ transplants, and vertical mode of
transmission also increased the infection risk. However, normally
the course of infection is self-limiting, but recently, more
aggressive chronic mode of infections have been reported in
immunocompromised patients especially SOT recipients on
immunosuppressive therapy. Initially, such chronic cases are
predominant with HEV genotype-3, but now, genotype- 1, 2,
and 4 also contributing, there worsening the situation. Patients
with pregnancy or with dual viral infections like HIV-HEV
or with hematological malignancies are also more prone to
contact HEV infection.
Identification and isolation of HEV from the different organs
like kidney, heart, spleen, thyroid, and pancreas, etc., suggested
the extrahepatic manifestations which further complicated the
understanding of the pathogenetic mechanism of hepatotropic
HEV. With lots of progress in the basic and clinical virology
which allows the development of efficient and feasible cell culture
and animal models, and with the declaration of EASL guidelines
for the HEV management, we now have a good insight of
HEV pathophysiology and well-recommended diagnostic and
treatment algorithm for HEV infected chronic patients.
