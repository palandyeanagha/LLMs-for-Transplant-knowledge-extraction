Abstract
Background The timing of intestinal failure (IF) surgery has changed. Most specialized centers now recommend
postponing reconstructive surgery for enteric fistula and emphasize that abdominal sepsis has to be resolved and the
patient’s condition improved. Our aim was to study the outcome of postponed surgery, to identify risk factors for
recurrence and mortality, and to define more precisely the optimal timing of reconstructive surgery.
Methods PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were systematically reviewed on the outcomes of reconstructive IF surgery (fistula recurrence, mortality, morbidity, hernia recurrence, total closure, enteral autonomy). If
appropriate, meta-analyses were performed. Optimal timing was explored, and risk factors for recurrence and
mortality were identified.
Results Fifteen studies were included. The weighted pooled fistula recurrence rate was 19% (95% CI 15–24). Lower
recurrence rates were found in studies with a longer median time and/or, at the minimum of the range, a longer time
interval to surgery. Overall mortality was 3% (95% CI 2–5). Total fistula closure rates ranged from 80 to 97%.
Enteral autonomy after reconstructive surgery, mentioned in four studies, varied between 79 and 100%.
Conclusions Postponed IF surgery for enteric fistula is associated with lower recurrence. Due to the wide range of
time to definitive surgery within each study, optimal timing of surgery could not be defined from published data.
Introduction
An enterocutaneous fistula (ECF) is an unnatural communication between the gastrointestinal tract and the skin.
Enteroatmospheric fistulas (EAF), with visible mucosa and
the absence of overlying soft-tissue within an open abdomen, form a special subset of ECFs. Approximately
75–85% of such fistulas arise as complications following
abdominal surgery [1]. Although ECF and EAF are rare,
they pose complex and challenging problems. The most
important homeostatic and metabolic challenge arising
from ECF or EAF is intestinal failure (IF). ECF/AEF
patients usually have type 2 IF [2]. Due to massive fluid
and electrolyte losses and reduced nutrient resorption, these
patients frequently rely on parenteral nutrition (PN) to
fulfill their nutritional demands. Sepsis elimination, fistula

output reduction, wound care, homeostasis and adequate
nutritional support are the cornerstones of treatment during
the so-called bridging-to-surgery period for which recommendations are given in the IF Guidelines of the European
Society of Coloproctology [2].
The first reports on delaying reconstructive surgery for
ECF/EAF appeared in the 1970s. It was not until 1983,
however, that a step-by-step strategy of ECF management
involving postponed ECF surgery was described [3, 4]. It
was recommended that surgery should be delayed by as
many as 6–8 weeks until all signs of sepsis had disappeared
and the patient had been restored to nutritional health.
However, it took another 20 years for the first reports to be
published on the management of patients according to this
strategy.
A reason to delay surgery in the case of ECF is the
chance of spontaneous closure, which is most likely to
occur in low-output fistula and within 3–6 months; EAF
never close spontaneously. Postponed reconstructive surgery also allows ample time for patient recovery, fistula
maturation, resolution of abdominal inflammation, and
softening of adhesions and scar tissue formation on an open
abdomen, enabling safe adhesiolysis. Nowadays, this is
common practice in dedicated IF centers but not embraced
in general.
The aim of this review was threefold. Our primary goal
was to systematically review the available literature on
fistula recurrence rates and secondary outcomes of postponed reconstructive surgery for ECF/EAF. As ECF/EAF
patient care has improved over the years, our review
excluded studies that compared outcomes with historical
cohorts. Our second goal was to define the optimal timing
of reconstructive surgery for patients with ECF/EAF.
Finally, we aimed to identify risk factors for fistula
recurrence and mortality.
Materials and methods
The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines [5] and the
MOOSE (Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) checklist [6] were followed.
Definitions
Postponed reconstructive surgery was defined as singlestaged, elective surgery for ECF/EAF takedown in
intestinal fistula patients which was delayed by a certain
period until sepsis had resolved and the patient had
regained the best achievable physical condition. Short-term
mortality was defined as either 30-day mortality or inhospital mortality. We did not limit reporting on morbidity
to one specific classification system. Total fistula closure
rate included successful primary ECF/EAF takedowns,
closures after repetitive surgery after recurrence, and
spontaneous closures after recurrence. Hernia recurrence
was defined as a ventral hernia after abdominal wall
reconstruction. Enteral autonomy was defined as the successful discontinuation of all types of artificial nutritional
support including parenteral nutrition and intravenous fluids and electrolytes, following the definition of the Association of Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland (ASGBI)
[7].
Search
On August 24, 2016, a systematic search was performed for
articles on the outcomes of elective surgery in patients with
enterocutaneous fistula and/or enteroatmospheric fistula.
The primary outcome was fistula recurrence, while secondary outcomes were mortality, morbidity, total closure
rate, hernia recurrence, and enteral autonomy. We involved
a clinical librarian to optimize the search strategy. We used
MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase (Ovid), and the Cochrane
Library to identify related studies. Our search terms
included enterocutaneous fistula, enteroatmospheric fistula,
intestinal failure, surgical treatment, closure, recurrence,
mortality, morbidity, and complications. Both MESH terms
and free text were used. ‘‘Appendix 1’’ contains the complete search. The search was not limited to year of publication or language. The authors F.V. and J.A.
independently screened all titles and abstracts. References
of the included studies were cross-checked for other relevant studies.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Studies reporting on 25 patients or more, and that addressed elective ECF/EAF takedowns as per the definition,
were included. The principles of elective surgery had to be
provided in the methods section. Additionally, studies at
least had to report on present review’s primary outcome,
i.e., fistula recurrence rate. Only studies on small bowel
and/or colon fistulas were included. Studies on pediatric
patients and studies addressing biliary, pancreatic, or anal
fistula surgery were excluded.
Quality assessment
The modified Methodological Index for Non-Randomized
Studies (MINORS) [8] was used to assess the methodological quality of all studies (‘‘Appendix 2’’). A maximum
of 14 points could be achieved.

Data extraction
Data on primary and, whenever possible, secondary outcomes were extracted from the text. Study characteristics,
i.e., year of publication, type of study, inclusion period,
number of elective patients, median time to surgery, and
follow-up were also retrieved from the text. Significant risk
factors for recurrence and mortality were identified in the
individual studies.
Statistical analysis
SPSS statistics, version 21.0, was used. Descriptive analyses were used to review the identified studies, and if
appropriate, meta-analyses were conducted using RStudio
statistics, version 2.13.1, and studies were pooled within a
random effects model.
Results
Out of 1549 articles initially identified by the search, 70
were selected for a full text review (Fig. 1). Fifty-five
articles were excluded for the following reasons: forty-two
articles did not describe the criteria for elective surgery nor
did they report separately on the results of acute and
elective surgery. Six studies included less than 25 elective
patients [9–14]. Four studies reported on two identical or
overlapping cohorts [15–18] and were, therefore, combined
for the purpose of our analysis. One study described staged
management [19], and three other studies did not report on
this review’s primary outcome [20–22]. One study was a
conference abstract. Finally, fifteen studies (10 retrospective cohort studies [16, 17, 23–30] and five prospective
cohort studies [31–35]) were included, comprising a total
of 1380 patients who had undergone elective ECF/EAF
surgery. Included studies were published between 2004 and
2016. Table 1 presents the characteristics and outcomes of
the included studies.

Baseline characteristics of included studies
The mean or median age varied between 48 [26] and 61
[28] years. Studies were comparable for the included percentage of small bowel fistulas, being more than 65% in
each study. Other fistulas included were colonic fistulas,
and four studies [24–26, 34] included gastric fistulas (less
than 6% of the fistulas). The etiologies of the fistulas were
comparable in most studies, with more than 75% of the
patients having fistulas as a result of complicated abdominal surgery. Only one study showed a lower percentage
(50%) of postoperative fistulas [27]. The percentage of
patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) varied
between 10% [25] and 50% [23]. Most studies included
both simple and complex fistulas such as EAF, and low as
well as high-output fistulas. Wainstein [30] focused on
patients with EAF only, and the study of Martinez [34]
included 84% EAF. Connoly et al. [31] included fistulas
within the open abdomen. Two other studies [28, 33]
focused on ECF takedown and simultaneous large complex
hernia repair. It is likely that these studies included more
complex fistulas than the other studies, but this was difficult to determine. Not all studies reported on all outcome
parameters, and therefore, the number of studies included
in each meta-analysis varied.
Quality of the studies included
All the studies included were scored using MINORS, and
the scores ranged from 6 to 14 points (maximum possible
score is 14, Table 1). No studies were excluded after
scoring.
Outcomes
ECF recurrence
Recurrence rates ranged from 5 to 38% (Table 1). In four
studies, recurrence was defined as 30-day recurrence
[25, 26, 28, 33], in two studies as 3-month recurrence
[23, 27], and in one study as 6-month recurrence [32].
Eight other studies defined recurrence as recurrence at any
point of time during follow-up (Table 1). The weighted
pooled ECF recurrence rate was 19% (95% CI 15–24), I
2
76% (Fig. 2). Figure 3 shows the median time to surgery
and the minimum of the range (left y-axis) and the percentage of recurrent ECF (right y-axis). Lower recurrence
rates were found in studies with a longer median time and/
or, at the minimum of the range, a longer time interval to
surgery. Lynch et al. [23] found an overall recurrence rate
of 21%. A subgroup analysis of those patients who had
undergone surgery within 3 months showed a recurrence
rate of 28% (10 of 36) compared to a recurrence rate of
15% (7 of 114) in patients who had their operation after

more than 3 months (P = .088). In a univariate analysis,
Martinez [34] found that fistula surgery within 20 weeks
was positively associated with mortality (P = 0.03).
However, they did not find an association with fistula
recurrence (P = 0.55). Brenner et al. [24] found that a
waiting time of 36 weeks or longer was a significant risk
factor for fistula recurrence. Patients who had undergone
surgery after 36 weeks found a recurrence rate of 36%,
compared to 12% in patients who had waited less than
36 weeks (P = .003). However, no statistical correction
for confounding variables such as (co)morbidity was performed and these patients may have had significant morbidities delaying their surgery.
Mortality
Short-term mortality rates were described in all studies
except in two [23, 34]. Mortality rates ranged from 0 to 7%
(Table 2). The overall weighted pooled mortality was 3%
(95% CI 2–5), I
2 0% (Fig. 4). The highest mortality rate
(7%) was reported by the study with the shortest median
waiting period to definitive surgery (median 72 days, range
4–270 days) among the included studies [16]. All other
studies reported mortality rates of 5% or less. Lynch et al.
[23] reported a 3-month mortality rate of 3%. Martinez
[34] reported a mortality rate of 20%, but this was mortality at any point during follow-up and the total follow-up
time was not recorded.
Morbidity
There was a wide variation in the methods of reporting
morbidity in the 15 studies. As listed in Table 1, morbidity
was reported in only 10 of the 15 studies. Different classification systems were used, and therefore, pooling of morbidity data for meta-analysis was not possible. Six studies
observed overall morbidity varying between 72 and 88%
[16, 25, 27, 28, 30, 31]. One study reported a postoperative
complication rate of 36% (scored according to the Clavien–
Dindo classification Grade III or IV) [29]. Four studies
reported on the occurrence of surgical site infections (SSIs)
as described by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention [25, 28, 31, 33]. These ranged from 21% to 65%. Krpata
et al. [34] found the highest percentage of SSIs, 65%; 19% of
patients required an additional surgical intervention; and
19% required interventional radiology. Other studies
reported less than 40% SSIs (range 21–38%). In one of these
studies [31], 5% of the patients needed radiological drainage
and in another study [32] 3% needed surgical re-interventions. More detailed information about the need for interventions for SSI was not provided. One study [23] did not
report on morbidity but described a 6% reoperation rate after
surgery.
Hernia recurrence rate
Only three studies reported hernia recurrences rates
[28, 31, 33]. The weighted pooled recurrence rate was 31%
(95% CI 24.0–39.0) (Fig. 5). All studies involved large
abdominal wall defects with simultaneous ECF takedown.
Information on removal of infected mesh was not reported.
Krpata et al. [33] used a non-cross-linked biologic mesh
in 97% of the cases. In 11%, a bridging mesh was required.
They had a hernia recurrence rate of 32%, at a mean follow-up of 20 months. Connoly et al. [31] used either suture
repair, suture repair with inlay prosthetic mesh, or

prosthetic mesh alone and found an overall hernia recurrence rate of 29% (follow-up median 29 months). Slater
et al. [28] found a hernia recurrence rate of 36% (mean
follow-up of 63 months), using a component separation
technique in 87% (34 of 39) of the patients, with a lightweight polypropylene mesh as reinforcement in 35% (12 of
34) of them. In that study, 10% of the patients had a
bridging repair.
Fistula closure rate
Twelve studies reported a total fistula closure rate that
varied between 80 and 97% [16, 17, 24–27, 29, 30, 32–35].
Some of the patients needed up to three reoperations to
achieve fistula closure; some patients died after recurrent
fistulas; and others were left with a fistula because the risk
of a reoperation was deemed too high.
Enteral autonomy
Only four studies reported on patients regaining enteral
autonomy. Datta [32] reported that of 12 patients receiving
PN before definitive surgery, none remained dependent
after surgery. In another study [27], in which 52% of the
patients required preoperative PN, all but two could discontinue PN. In two other studies [25, 29], with 80 and
100% of the patients requiring PN preoperatively, respectively, 86 and 79% of the patients were able to discontinue
PN postoperatively.
Risk factors for recurrence and mortality
Many of the studies performed analyses to define risk
factors for ECF recurrence, mortality, morbidity, hernia
recurrence, or other factors negatively associated with
healing. As ECF recurrence was the primary outcome of
the present review, and mortality was also regarded as an

important other outcome, risk factors that were found to be
statistically significant for recurrence and mortality in one
or more of the included articles have been summarized.
Eight studies performed a specific analysis for risk factors
for recurrence and mortality. For this review, these factors
were divided into preoperative, operative, and postoperative risk factors and are summarized in Table 2.
Some of the risk factors are generally related to poor
outcomes, such as postoperative complications or comorbidity. Other risk factors such as surgical technique are of
more interest as they can be amended by the surgeon.
Lynch et al. [25] found a fistula recurrence rate of 36% in
those patients who underwent oversewing or wedge repair
of an ECF, in contrast to a 17% recurrence in those patients
who had undergone complete resection of the affected
bowel segment. Brenner et al. [27] also found a fistula
recurrence percentage of 22% for oversewing or wedge
repair and 11% for complete segment resection. Although
this effect on short-term fistula recurrence was not significant, it did have a significant effect on 1-year mortality
(P = .003). Two studies showed that a stapled anastomosis
was associated with a less favorable outcome [27, 28].
Brenner et al. [27] found a stapled anastomosis to be
independently associated with ECF recurrence, and Owen

et al. [28] found a significant negative effect of a stapled
anastomosis during fistula surgery on 1-year mortality.
Discussion
The management of ECF and/or EAF and the timing of IF
surgery in patients with enteric fistula have changed over
the past years. This systematic review and meta-analysis
addresses the effect of postponed reconstructive surgery on
outcome. The present review included fifteen studies; ten
of which were retrospective cohort studies from single
institutions. Recurrence rates varied considerably between
studies, from 5 to 38% with a weighted pooled recurrence
rate of 19% (95% CI 15–24). However, heterogeneity was
considerable (I
2 76%). Lower recurrence rates were found
in studies with a longer median time and/or, at the minimum of the range, a longer time interval to surgery as
shown in Fig. 3. The weighted pooled mortality rate was
4% and, although difficult to compare between studies,
morbidity was considerable.
Present review aimed to define the optimal timing for
enteric fistula surgery. Although the median time to surgery
was reported in thirteen of the fifteen studies, a wide range
of time to surgery within a study as well as a large variation
in follow-up after surgery was present. For example,
Rahbour et al. [29] described 149 patients with a median
time to surgery of 360 days. The time to surgery, however,
varied between 30 and 5100 days, and interquartile ranges
were not provided. Therefore, we decided to plot the
minimum of the range including the median in days to
surgery for each study (Fig. 3) combined with ECF
recurrence rates. Although a trend was found that a longer
median time and/or, at the minimum of the range, a longer
time interval to surgery has lower recurrence, it was not
possible to define optimal timing of reconstructive surgery
based on published data. Moreover, seven studies included
patients with a period to surgery of less than 30 days
[18, 25–29, 34]. This suggests that some of the patients in
these studies may not have fulfilled the criteria of postponed surgery although mentioned in the present review’s
methods section. Additionally, late referral to a specialized
center after several surgical attempts might also have
introduced a selection bias. Despite these difficulties,
Fig. 3 indicates that a longer time to surgery is associated
with lower recurrence. The study of Owen et al. [25] is the
only outlier in the figure. However, as seen in the figure and in Table 1, this study also included patients with
0 days to surgery possibly explaining the higher recurrence
rate.
The 30-day or in-hospital mortality rates were all 7% or
less. This is much lower than reported in previous studies
including both patients with acute and postponed surgery.
These studies reported mortality rates between 10 and 20%
after ECF surgery [36–39]. Different factors likely
improved mortality rates, such as improved wound care,
better intensive care facilities, and the possibility of radiological drainage. Postponed surgery will also have contributed to these improved results.
Stapled anastomosis was found a significant risk factor
for fistula recurrence and 1-year mortality [28]. Based on
the limited data in intestinal failure surgery and personal
experience omitting bear staples in these types of abdomen,
most of the specialists in the field believe that hand-sewn
anastomoses are superior to stapled anastomosis in fistula
surgery. No studies comparing the techniques for intestinal
failure surgery have been published. However, most surgeons in the field feel that hand-sewn anastomoses are
superior. Although the exact mechanism is unknown, it is
believed that side (blind-end) staples can have large parts
of bear staples which react with the environment and have
a high risk of fistulation, certainly in contamination of
microscopic leakage and/or intra-abdominal abscesses.
Side-to-side length stapling leaves parts of the staples
without initial peritoneal coverage. Finally, most of the
patients undergo extensive adhesiolysis resulting in thickness of the bowel wall and, therefore, possibly stapled
anastomoses are less safe.
Several limitations of this systematic review need to be
addressed. The vast majority of studies were retrospective
cohort studies of low to moderate quality. There was
considerable clinical heterogeneity within and between
cohorts due to different patient and fistula characteristics,
surgical techniques, and follow-up making it difficult to
compare studies. Importantly, only 6 of 15 included studies
reported a follow-up of more than 3 months with respect to
fistula recurrence; 4 studies reported only 30 day of fistula
recurrence follow-up. Some of the studies did not mention
follow-up time. This hampered a reliable estimate of fistula
recurrence rates and in relation to timing of surgery,
although most fistulas recur early in the postoperative
period. As ECFs are relatively rare, most of the included
studies came from specialized centers. Patients with less
complex fistulas and in a better condition were less likely
to have been referred. Therefore, the patients included in
the present review reflect the more complicated end of the
spectrum of enteric fistula patients. Despite these limitations, this review is the first to summarize the outcome of
postponed ECF takedown as currently performed by most
specialized centers.
Prospective and standardized data collection across IF
centers is required before more precise recommendations
can be made about optimal timing of reconstructive surgery
for ECF and/or EAF. The optimal timing of IF surgery
probably requires a time interval between 6 and 12 months
after the last laparotomy because resolving abdominal

infection, restoring nutritional state and homeostasis, and
providing adequate wound care and muscle strength
improving care like physiotherapy take a long period. This
bridging-to-surgery approach was recently recommended
and is now standard practice in IF centers [2].
