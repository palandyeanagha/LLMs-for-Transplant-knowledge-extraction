due to lymphocyte infiltration. In 1995, Japanese investigators3 firstly proposed a concept of “autoimmune
pancreatitis (AIP)”, in which the patients showed diffusely enlarged pancreas, narrowing pancreatogram, increased serum IgG, presence of autoantibodies, fibrotic
changes with lymphocytic infiltration and steroidal
efficacy. Thereafter, many AIP cases have been reported from Japan, and AIP has been accepted as a new
clinical entity.4,5 The histopathological findings of AIP
show massive infiltration of lymphoplasmacytes with
fibrosis, which is consistent with lymphoplasmacytic
sclerosing pancreatitis (LPSP).6 Many Japanese investigators have paid great attention to AIP, especially with
regard to its unique pancreatic images,2 IgG4,7 diseaseassociated autoantibodies,8 extrapancreatic lesions,6,9–14

Introduction
In 1961, Sarles et al.1 asked the following question
regarding the particular cases of pancreatitis with
hypergammaglobulinemia: “Chronic inflammatory sclerosis of the pancreas—an autoimmune pancreatic
disease?” As similar cases were rarely observed, a relationship between such pancreatitis and autoimmunity
was viewed skeptically during the following several decades. In 1992, Toki et al.2 have reported 4 cases with
unusual diffuse irregular narrowing of the main pancreReceived: June 26, 2006 / Accepted: June 27, 2006

concept of AIP has changed slightly to include extrapancreatic lesions and associated disorders, which suggests that the current diagnostic criteria are becoming
inadequate.
In 2003, the Research Committee of Intractable Diseases of the Pancreas, supported by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Chairman, M.
Otsuki), began to review the current diagnostic criteria
in light of recently acquired information and knowledge. The team organized a working group (WG),
consisting of the team members and researchers specializing in autoimmune pancreatitis, to develop a proposal
for the revision of the current diagnostic criteria. On 7
October 2005 and 22 April 2006, the Research Committee of Intractable Diseases of the Pancreas and the
Japan Pancreas Society jointly held open forums to
discuss the proposed amendments.
This report describes the background of the proposed
amendments and the final proposal for the revised version of the clinical diagnostic criteria of AIP.
Background of the amendment of the diagnostic
criteria proposed by the working group of the
Research Committee of Intractable Diseases of
the Pancreas
Table 1 shows the diagnostic criteria 2002 of AIP proposed by the Japan Pancreas Society.16 The members of
the WG accumulated 147 cases of AIP and identified
the cases that did not fulfill the current diagnostic criteria but were strongly suspected to be AIP. It then evaluated those cases in detail using imaging, laboratory, and
pathological findings, and unanimously rediagnosed
some of them as AIP. Using the analyzed data, the
members then summarized the current status and problems of AIP in Japan, as outlined below. After reviewing the material in an expanded open discussion in
October 2004 in Fukuoka City, the Research Committee of Intractable Diseases of the Pancreas amended the
current diagnostic criteria for AIP. Major discussions in
this open meeting are summarized below.

Concept and definition of AIP
1. The following extrapancreatic lesions may be associated with AIP: biliary lesions, sialadenitis,
retroperitoneal fibrosis, enlarged celiac and hilar
lymph nodes, chronic thyroiditis, and interstitial nephritis9–14 (Table 2). AIP may be a systemic disorder.
2. Sclerosing cholangitis associated with AIP is different from primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC),
because of its effective response to steroid therapy
and of the presence of IgG4-positive plasma cell
infiltration.9–14
3. Sialadenitis coexisting with AIP is negative for both
anti-SSA and anti-SSB antibodies and shows IgG4-
positive plasma cell infiltration, suggesting that it
is different from typical Sjögren’s syndrome but is
similar to the sclerosing sialadenitis observed in
Mikulicz’s disease and Küttner’s tumor.9,10,14
4. In Western countries, ulcerative colitis and the formation of tumors associated with pancreatic lesions
are more frequently observed than in Japan.4 Moreover, pancreatic duct lesions with infiltration of leukocytes as well as LPSP are sometimes observed in
Western countries17,18 but not in Japan. These findings may thus be somewhat contrary to the definition
and concept of the disease adopted in Japan.
5. The biggest problem in diagnosing AIP is how to
distinguish it from pancreatic or biliary cancer. With
the current diagnostic criteria for AIP, many cases
that seem to be AIP are excluded, as the criteria were
established to rule out false positive cases but to
confidently diagnose definite cases of AIP.4,14
Image findings
1. Some cases are consistent with the hematological
and histopathological findings of AIP, even though
the pancreatic image data show that the lesions are
localized to less than one-third of the pancreas.16
2. Some cases fulfill only the image diagnostic criteria
for AIP but respond to steroid therapy.14
Laboratory findings
1. Patients with AIP frequently show an increased level
of serum IgG4,7 a subclass of IgG, although the
pathophysiological significance is still unclear. Serum
levels of IgG4 in 147 patients with AIP (602.8 ±
609.1 mg/dl) were significantly higher than those in
other, control patients (52.4 ± 57.2 mg/dl) (Fig. 1).
2. Using receiver operating characteristic curves for the
147 cases of AIP and 180 cases of other diseases, the
cutoff value for the serum IgG4 was determined to
be 128 mg/dl (Fig. 2), which confirmed the validity of
the evidenced value of 134mg/dl.7
Pathological findings
1. There is growing evidence that patients with AIP
exhibit histopathological symptoms of lymphoplasmacytic sclerosing pancreatitis.4,6,17,18 That is, AIP

cells are IgG4-positive.14
2. European and U.S. reports of the destruction of the
pancreatic duct epithelium in the presence of predominant neutrophils (idiopathic ductcentric chronic
pancreatitis17 or granulocyte epithelial lesion18) have
not been confirmed in Japan owing to insufficient
study and will be a topic of further study.
3. Pathologically, extrapancreatic lesions are similar to
the fibrosis and the lymphoplasmacytic infiltration
seen in the pancreatic lesions.
Prognosis
1. Some patients with AIP form pancreatic stones, and
the long-term prognosis of AIP is still unclear.14
Final revision based on the discussion in
the open forums
In two recently held open forums, the committee members vigorously exchanged opinions about the amendments proposed by the Research Committee of
Intractable Diseases of the Pancreas, and unanimously
agreed to the finalized amendments (Table 3). The
medical treatment guidelines in the current diagnostic
criteria have been deleted from the proposed
amendments. Those issues that were discussed in
the open forums but not included in the proposed
amendments are noted below as topics for future
consideration.
1. Cases of AIP reported from Western countries are
more often associated with ulcerative colitis and the
formation of tumors compared with Japanese cases;
these associations are somewhat contrary to the
definition and concept of the disease adopted in
Table 3. Clinical Diagnostic Criteria of Autoimmune Pancreatitis (revised proposal) (Proposed by the Research Committee of
Intractable Diseases of the Pancreas, supported by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, and the Japan Pancreas
Society)
It is suspected that the pathogenesis of autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) involves autoimmune mechanisms. Currently, the
main characteristic findings of observed cases of AIP are the diffuse enlargement of the pancreas and the narrowing of the
pancreatic duct, associated with findings suggestive of the involvement of autoimmune mechanisms such as increased levels of
γ-globulin and IgG, the presence of autoantibodies, and an effective response to steroid therapy. In some cases, AIP shows
extrapancreatic manifestations such as sclerosing cholangitis, sclerosing sialadenitis, and retroperitoneal fibrosis, suggesting
that AIP is a systemic disease. In Western countries, AIP is more frequently observed in association with ulcerative colitis
and tumor formation, which observations are somewhat contrary to the definition and concept of the disease adopted in
Japan.
Patients with AIP often experience discomfort in the epigastrium, obstructive jaundice due to bile duct stricture, and
diabetes mellitus. AIP is more common in middle-aged and elderly men. Although long-term prognosis of the disease is not
clear, pancreatic stone formation has been found in some cases.
When diagnosing AIP, it is important to differentiate it from neoplastic lesions such as pancreatic or biliary cancers, and to
avoid facile therapeutic diagnosis by steroid administration. The present criteria, therefore, are based on the minimum
consensus features of AIP in order to avoid the misdiagnosis of pancreatic or biliary cancer as far as possible but not to pick
up suspicious cases of AIP.
I. Clinical diagnostic criteria
1. Diffuse or segmental narrowing of the main pancreatic duct with irregular wall and diffuse or localized enlargement of the
pancreas by imaging studies, such as abdominal ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI).
2. High serum γ-globulin, IgG, or IgG4, or the presence of autoantibodies, such as antinuclear antibodies and rheumatoid
factor.
3. Marked interlobular fibrosis and prominent infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells in the periductal area, occasionally
with lymphoid follicles in the pancreas.
Diagnosis of autoimmune pancreatitis is established when criterion 1, together with criterion 2 and/or 3, are fulfilled.
However, it is necessary to exclude malignant diseases such as pancreatic or biliary cancers.
Description notes
A. Imaging studies
1. Diffuse or localized swelling of the pancreas
Abdominal US, CT, and/or MRI show diffuse or localized swelling of the pancreas.
a. On US, pancreatic swelling is usually hypoechoic, sometimes with scattered echogenic spots.
b. Contrast-enhanced CT generally shows delayed enhancement similar to a normal pancreas with sausage-like
enlargement, and/or a capsular-like low-density rim.
c. MRI shows diffuse or localized enlargement of the pancreas with lower density in the T1-weighed image and higher
density in the T2-weighed image compared with the corresponding liver image.

Table 3. Continued
2. Narrowing of the pancreatic duct
The main pancreatic duct shows diffuse or localized narrowing.
a. Unlike obstruction or stricture, narrowing of the pancreatic duct extends over a larger range, where the duct is
narrowed with irregular walls. In typical cases, more than one-third of the entire length of the pancreatic duct is
narrowed. Even in cases where the narrowing is segmental and extends to less than one-third of the total length, the
upper part of the main pancreatic duct rarely shows notable dilatation.
b. When the pancreatic images show typical findings but laboratory data do not, AIP is possible. However, without
histopathological examination, it is difficult to distinguish AIP from pancreatic cancer.
c. To obtain images of the pancreatic duct, it is necessary to use endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in
addition to direct images taken during an operation or of specimens. Currently, it is difficult to depend for the diagnosis
on magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography.
3. The pancreatic image findings described above may be observed retrospectively from the time of diagnosis.
B. Laboratory data
1. In many cases, patients with AIP show increased levels of serum γ-globulin, IgG, or IgG4. High serum IgG4, however, is
not specific to AIP, since it is also observed in other disorders such as atopic dermatitis, pemphigus, or asthma. Currently,
the significance of high serum IgG4 in the pathogenesis and the pathophysiology of AIP is unclear.
2. Although increased levels of serum γ-globulin (≥2.0g/dl), IgG (≥1800 mg/dl), and IgG4 (≥135mg/dl) may be used as a
criterion for the diagnosis of AIP, further studies are necessary.
3. Autoantibodies such as antinuclear, anti-lactoferrin, anti-carbonic anhydrase antibody and rheumatoid factor are often
detected in patients with AIP.
C. Pathohistological findings of the pancreas
1. Fibrotic changes associated with prominent infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells, occasionally with lymphoid
follicles, are observed. In many cases, infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells is observed.
2. Lymphocytic infiltration is prominent in the periductal area, together with interlobular fibrosis, occasionally including
intralobular fibrosis.
3. Inflammatory cell infiltration involves the ducts and results in diffuse narrowing of the pancreatic duct with atrophy of
acini.
4. Obliterative phlebitis is often observed.
5. Although fine-needle biopsy under ultrasonic endoscopy is useful for differentiating AIP from malignant tumors, diagnosis
may be difficult if the specimen is too small.
D. Endocrine and exocrine function of the pancreas
Some patients with AIP show a decline of exocrine pancreatic function and develop diabetes mellitus. In some cases, steroid
therapy improves endocrine and exocrine pancreatic dysfunction.
II. Relationship to extrapancreatic lesions and other associated disorders
AIP may be associated with sclerosing cholangitis, sclerosing sialadenitis, or retroperitoneal fibrosis. Most AIP patients
with sclerosing sialadenitis show negativity for both anti-SSA and anti-SSB antibodies, which may suggest that AIP differs
from Sjögren’s syndrome. Sclerosing cholangitis-like lesions accompanying AIP and primary sclerosing cholangitis respond
differently to steroid therapy and have different prognoses, suggesting that they are not the same disorder. Further studies
are necessary to clarify the role of autoimmune mechanisms in AIP.
Japan.4,9,17,18 These points were excluded from the
Japanese notes, because in Japan, the basic concepts
of AIP are generally accepted as pancreatitis featuring abnormal immunity, an enlarged pancreas, and a
narrowing of the pancreatic duct. However, these
controversial points were considered for inclusion in
the introduction to the English notes because they
were deemed necessary to clarify the inconsistencies
between the findings of foreign and domestic
researchers.
2. It was argued that AIP can be diagnosed by imaging
data and the effective response to steroid therapy
alone. This argument, however, was excluded because of two problems. First, no other autoimmune
disorders use steroidal effect for diagnosis except for
the scoring system for autoimmune hepatitis, in
which the steroidal effect is not used for the differential diagnosis of malignancy. Second, above all, there
was a concern that its adoption might encourage the
use of facile therapeutic diagnostic techniques just to
distinguish AIP from malignant tumors such as pancreatic cancer.
3. There was an argument as to whether the proposal
should specify methods for ruling out other pancreatic disorders and pancreatic/biliary cancers. It was
decided that each institute may decide the methods
at their discretion, because standardization is rather
difficult.

K. Okazaki et al.: Clinical diagnostic criteria of autoimmune pancreatitis 631
Conclusion
The current concept of AIP including extrapancreatic
lesions and associated disorders suggests that AIP may
be a systemic disorder. As the concept of the disease has
undergone changes, a revised version of the clinical diagnostic criteria of AIP in Japan has been proposed. Although it is not possible to establish diagnostic criteria
that satisfy everyone, the Japanese criteria are based on
the minimum consensus features of AIP in order to avoid
the misdiagnosis of malignancy as far as possible, but not
to pick up suspicious cases of AIP.
