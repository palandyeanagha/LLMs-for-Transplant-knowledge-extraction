207-215 ── Invasive fungal infection is a fatal complication in liver transplantation and it 
is very difficult to diagnose at the early stage. The aim of this study was to review our 
experience with invasive fungal infections in living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) and 
to analyze the risk factors and the impact of β-D glucan. From 1991 to 2005, 96 LDLTs 
were performed in our institution and we measured the serum level of β-D glucan in order 
to clarify the diagnosis. Invasive fungal infection was diagnosed based on clinical symptoms, culture, radiological evidence and β-D glucan. Active fungal infection was treated 
with fluconazole, amphotericin B, flucytosine and micafungin. Risk factors both pre- and 
post- LDLT were analyzed. Candida albicans was the most frequently isolated species 
(70%). The risk factors identified by univariate analysis include the following four conditions: acute blood purification (plasma exchange with or without continuous hemodiafiltration), hepatic vein complications, renal failure and respiratory failure. By logistic regression analysis, hepatic vein complications and respiratory failure were identified as 
independent risk factors. The risk factors for invasive fungal infection of LDLT in Japan 
have not been well analyzed and this report will provide valuable information for the prevention of the fungal infection. ──── invasive fungal infection; living donor liver transplantation; β-D glucan; risk factor; complication

Fungal infection is a potentially fatal complication in patients subjected to liver transplantation. The incidence of fungal infection in liver 
transplantation is higher than in transplantation of 
other solid organs, ranging from 4 to 42% with a 
mortality of 25-69% (Patel et al. 1996; Singh et 
al. 1997, 2002; Rabkin et al. 2000; Paya 2001). 
Many reports have been published about risk factors for invasive fungal infection in recipients of 
deceased donor liver grafts (Gladdy et al. 1999; 
Fortun et al. 2002); on the other hand, there have 
been no reports about the risk factors for living 
donor liver transplantation (LDLT). Most LDLTs 
are elective surgery, thus it is possible to treat pre-

208 N. Kawagishi et al. 
existing infections and prepare the patient by 
administering prophylactic agents. However, in 
LDLT the graft is smaller than that recovered 
from a deceased donor, and it involves technical 
difficulties such as the small diameter of vessels 
and biliary ducts. Therefore, it needs to have special consideration for the invasive fungal infection 
in LDLT (Suzuki et al. 2000). So it is important 
to know the risk factors in LDLT for the early 
management.
In the clinical field, it is very difficult to 
diagnose an invasive fungal infection in the early 
stage, because the pathogens cannot be detected 
until the infection has become quite severe 
(Aikawa et al. 2002). Besides, there are no significantly superior chemical makers for the diagnosis of invasive fungal infection. Therefore, 
there are no global standardized criteria in this 
regard (Avery 2001). In Japan serum β -D 
glucan is used for the diagnosis of fungal infection. Obayashi et al. (1995) reported that serum 
β-D glucan was a highly sensitive and specific 
test for invasive deep mycosis and fungal febrile 
episodes, and would substantially benefit immunocompromised patients. In the present study we 
investigated the specificity and sensitivity of 
β-D glucan for the detection of invasive fungal 
infection in LDLT recipients. This test, however, 
provides no information on cryptococcosis, 
because C neoformans produces less β-D glucan 
than do candida and asperillus (Obayashi et al. 
1995). But we experienced its usefulness in case 
of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia whose clinical symptoms are closely correlated with the level 
of β-D glucan.
In this study we review our experience with 
fungal infections in LDLT recipients and report 
the risk factors for invasive fungal infection. We 
also discuss the usefulness of the β-D glucan in 
the diagnosis and therapeutical evaluation of 
invasive fungal infection in LDLT recipients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Characteristics of the patients
From July 1991 to November 2005, 96 living related liver transplantations were performed in pediatric and 
adult patients with end-stage liver disease in the Division 
of Advanced Surgical Science and Technology, Graduate 
School of Medicine, Tohoku University. This program 
was approved by the ethics committees in our hospital 
and the patients were given informed consent about the 
LDLT. Donors were selected among parents, brothers or 
sisters and spouses on the basis of liver function tests, 
serological markers of hepatitis, ABO blood group, graft/
recipient size matching, lymphocyte cross-matching and 
human leukocyte (lymphocyte) antigen typing. All the 
recipients were trasplanted the right lobe, left lobe or the 
left lateral segment of the liver. The primary diseases of 
the recipients were biliary atresia in 54, primary biliary 
cirrhosis (PBC) in 12, hepatocellular carcinoma in 6, 
cryptogenic liver cirrhosis in 4, metabolic disorders in 4, 
and other diseases in 16. These 96 recipients were 57 
females and 39 males. The mean age was 18 years 8 
month, ranging from 5 months to 63 years, and the mean 
weight was 31.2 kg, ranging from 5.3 kg to 89.0 kg at the 
time of transplantation.
Anti-infection therapy and immunosuppressive therapy
Several specimens, including pharyngeal swabs, 
nasal swabs, urine and feces were cultured before LDLT 
and if methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus 
(MRSA) or fungus were isolated, they were treated by 
vancomycin, mupirocin calcium and fluconazole. 
Routine preoperative bowel preparation was performed 
orally by fluconazole (3 mg/kg/day) and kanamycin (50 
mg/kg/day) for 3 days before surgery and gargle by 
amphotericin B. For the children above 2 years old who 
had been performed splenectomy or had a plan of splenectomy at the time of transplantation, they had vaccination for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Hemophilus 
influenzae before transplantation. Fluconazole (5 mg/kg/
day) or micafungin (50 mg/day) were given intravenously for fungal prophylaxis for the first 1 week after operation. From the second week after transplantation 
fluconazole was given orally at the dose of 3 mg/kg/day 
for another one or two weeks. Trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole was given routinely for Pneumocystis 
carinii. Febrile episode were treated empirically with 
broad-spectrum antibioticus until culture results were 
known. Thereafter, bacterial infections were treated with 
antibiotics based on specific sensitivity patterns. 
Recipients with suspected fungal infection underwent a 
chest or abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan, 
when appropriate, and fundoscopy for Candida endophthalmitis, and suspected sites of infection were cultured. Fungal infections were identified in some ways, 

Risk Factors on Invasive Fungal Infection for LDLT 209
they were treated with an initial dose of fluconazole (3-6 
mg/kg/day), amphotericin B (0.25 mg/kg/day), micafungin (100-150 mg/day) or flucytosine (100 mg/day). 
Routine surveillance cultures after transplantation were 
obtained from pharyngeal swabs, nasal swabs, urine, 
central venous lines, abdominal drains, nasogasrtic tubes, 
endotracheal tubes and stool. Venous and urinary catheters were routinely changed when colonization of an 
indwelling tube was suspected. Serum level of Candida, 
Aspergillus and Cryptococcus antigens were also measured for the diagnosis. The culture medium used was 
fungus specific. Candida antigen was detected by latex 
agglutination and the positive value was more than two 
times higher compared to control. Asperguillus antigen 
was detected by latex agglutination and this is qualitative 
analysis. Cryptococcus antigen was detected by latex 
agglutination and the positive value was more than eight 
times higher compared to control. β-D glucan was determined by test kits (Wako, Inc., Tokyo), and the cut-off 
value was 11 pg/ml. The timing of sampling for these 
parameters was twice before transplantation and twice 
per week for one or two months after transplantation. 
The value was the maximal one.
The immunosuppressive regimen consisted of 
cyclosporine (CsA), tacrolimus (TAC), azathioprine 
(AZ), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and methylprednisolone (MP).
Definitions of invasive fungal infection
Fungal colonization was defined as the presence of 
a fungus in one or more surveillance superficial cultures 
in the absence of any clinical symptoms or signs of infection. Invasive fungal infections were divided into definite and probable infections according to the following 
criteria : definite invasive fungal infection was diagnosed 
by one of these criteria as follows: 1) presence of fungus 
in the blood, cerebrospinal fluid, ascites and biopsy 
specimens; 2) ophthalmologic evidence; 3) isolation of 
fungus from bronchoalveolar lavage with radiological 
evidence of pneumonitis. Probable invasive fungal 
infection was defined as isolation of a fungus from one 
superficial site and more than 11 pg/ml serum level of 
β-D glucan or one of these two criteria together with 
febrile symptom above 38°C which was not responded 
by antibiotics for more than one week or radiological 
evidence of pneumonitis or esophagitis.
Clinical data analysis
Clinical data were analyzed to determine the risk 
factors that might contribute to the fungal infections. 
Preoperative factors such as gender, age at transplantation, body weight, serum total bilirubin and creatinine 
levels, number of pre-transplanat abdominal surgery, 
pre-transplanat plasmapheresis and pre-transplant fungal 
colonization were compiled. Intraoperative variables 
included duration of operation, blood loss, graft vs 
recipient ratio and the type of biliary reconstruction. 
Postoperative variables were collected until present time. 
This included the number of laparotomies and plasma 
exchange, total number of days in intensive care unit 
(ICU), total number of days intubated, vascular and 
biliary complications, number of viral and methicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections, episodes of biopsy proven rejections, graft-recipient weight 
ratio. Respiratory failure was defined as requiring intubation for more than 2 weeks or re-intubation, renal failure was defined as continuous hemodiafiltration (CHDF), 
continuous hemofiltration (CHF) or hemodialysis (HD) 
was initiated.
Statistical analyses were performed using Stat View 
4.5 (Abacus Concepts, Inc., Berkeley, CA, USA). 
Univariate statistical analysis for invasive fungal infection vs control group was performed by means of the 
Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables and MannWhitney’s U-test for continuous variables. P value less 
than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The 
factors identified on univariate analysis to be associated 
with p value less than 0.20 were then entered into a stepwise logistic regression analysis to identify independent 
risk factors for invasive fungal infection.
RESULTS
During the study period, mycoses were 
detected in 48 patients (50.0%) before LDLT, in 
63 (65.6%) after LDLT, and in 38 (39.6%) 
patients during both periods (Table 1). Before 
LDLT C. albicans was isolated from 72.9% of the 
recipients followed by C. glabrata (18.8%), and 
others (8.3%). After LDLT, C. albicans was isolated from 71.4% of the recipients followed by C. 
glabrata (31.7%), yeast like fungus (15.9%), 
Candida spp (12.7%), C. guilliermondii (7.9%) 
and C. tropicalis (7.9%). The intestines and pharynx were the most frequent colonized sites followed by urine and stomach. Forty-eight recipients who had fungal colonization before LDLT 
had no symptoms of infection. Sera from 8 

210 N. Kawagishi et al. 
patients were positive for Candida antigens 
before LDLT and from 18 after LDLT. 
Aspergillus antigen was not detected in serum 
from any patient in our institution and Aspergillus 
spp was isolated from two recipients but it was 
not responsible for fungal infection. There was 
no patient with pneumonia or meningitis caused 
by Aspergillus species. Cryptococcus luteolus
was isolated once before LDLT and serum 
Cryptococcus antigen was detected in one recipient after LDLT. None of the patients had severe 
infection caused by Cryptococcus species.
We experienced 2 definite and 6 probable 
cases of invasive fungal infections (Table 2). 
Most of the invasive fungal infections occurred 
within 2 months after LDLT. Seven recipients 
were diagnosed as having pneumonia by chest 
X-ray or CT scan and one recipient was diagnosed 
sepsis based on the results of an arterial blood 
culture. C. albicans was isolated from sputa of 4 
out of eight recipients with a body temperature of 
38°C or more and radiological evidence of pneumonia. Five out of eight recipients with invasive 
fungal infections died because of graft failure or 
multiple organ failure. No fungus was isolated 
from two of 6 patients with probable fungal infections who had high serum levels of β-D glucan 
(86, 38 pg/ml), a body temperature of 38°C or 
more and radiological evidence of pneumonia.

Risk Factors on Invasive Fungal Infection for LDLT 211
their fungal pneumonia were treated with fluconazole and antibiotics. One recipient who was 
diagnosed as having Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia had a quite high serum level of β -D 
glucan (169 pg/ml) and his clinical symptoms 
correlated with the level of β-D glucan. He was 
found to be positive for Pneumocystis carinii in 
his sputa from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) by 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and X-ray findings revealed pneumonia; thus, he was treated 
with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
Twenty-six factors, including 7 pretransplantation, 4 intraoperative, and 15 posttransplantation 
variables, were examined by univariate analysis 
to determine the risk factors that predispose to 
invasive fungal infection (Table 3). We did not 
show β-D glucan as a factor, because it was not 
measured in the first 21 patients. But there was a 
significant difference between recipients with 
invasive fungal infections and those with noninvasive fungal infections (p = 0.001). The statistically significant factors were the number of posttransplant episodes of acute blood purification 
(plasma exchange with or without CHDF) (p = 
0.031), hepatic vein complications (p = 0.014), 
renal failure (p = 0.004) and respiratory failure 
(p = 0.005), etc. Multivariate analysis showed an 
independent association of the development of 
invasive fungal infection with hepatic vein 
complications (OR, 26.1 [95% CI, 1.23-553.19]) 
and respiratory failure (OR, 52.3 [95% CI, 
1.51-1,811.85]) (Table 4). Among the patients of 
invasive fungal infections patient no. 37 and 40 
had hepatic vein complication, and no. 12, 22, 39, 
40, 48, 87 had respiratory failure. Overall mortality was significantly higher in the group of recipients with invasive fungal infections than in the 
group of those without invasive fungal infections 
(62.5% [5 of 8] vs 15.9% [14 of 88]; p = 0.0015).
DISCUSSION
Invasive fungal infection is one of the fatal 
complications and influences the survival of 
LDLT recipients. In this report we investigated 
the risk factors for invasive fungal infection and

Risk Factors on Invasive Fungal Infection for LDLT 213
this type of infection in LDLT recipients.
In our institution Candida spp. was the species most frequently isolated pre- and post- transplantation, and among them C. albicans accounted for over 70% of the isolates. This result 
derived from the high level of gastrointestinal 
colonization with Candida spp., manipulation of 
the gastrointestinal tract during surgery with 
increased translocation across the gut mucosal 
barrier, and impaired hepatic reticuloendothelial 
function (Matsumoto et al. 2004), as well as prolonged use of an indwelling catheter which promotes fungal colonization by providing a vascular 
portal of entry.
In deceased donor liver transplantation 
(DDLT) Candida spp. constitute the most frequent 
cause of invasive fungal infection followed by 
Aspergillus spp., and the same tendency is 
observed in LDLT. Among Candida spp., C. 
albicans was the most predominant followed by C. 
glabrata, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, C. krusei
(Gladdy et al. 1999; Kawagishi et al. 2004; 
Takakura et al. 2004). Candida overgrowth in the 
lumen of the gastrointestinal tract is secondary to 
changes in the bacterial flora. It has been clearly 
established that the presence of anaerobic bacteria 
in the gut conveys a protective effect as they neutralize the overgrowth of Candida (van der Waaij 
1982). This has been the basis for the use of 
selective bowel decontamination regimens, the 
main goal of which is to maintain a healthy anaerobic flora (Arnow et al. 1996; van der Waaij et al. 
1982; Wiesner et al. 1988). Some selective bowel 
decontamination regimens have included oral 
amphotericin preparations to further enhance the 
elimination of Candida from the bowel. The clinical effectiveness of this technique in reducing 
systemic Candida infection, however, remains 
unknown. In our experience drug resistant C. 
glabrata meight be increased in the invasive fungal infection through the intensive use of prophylactic agents with our protocol.
In our series there were 8 recipients with 
invasive fungal infections, including 6 probable 
cases, and of them 5 died. Other authors also 
reported that the development of invasive fungal 
infection after liver transplantation was associated 
with a high mortality rate of up to 80% due to the 
difficulty in making an early diagnosis of the disease (Nieto-Rodriguez et al. 1996; Gladdy et al. 
1999; Fortun et al. 2002). Particularly, invasive 
aspergillosis was quite fatal (Fortun et al. 2002). 
Diagnosis of invasive fungal infection by conventional superficial cultures and fungal isolation 
from tissues, bronchoalveolar lavage or cerebrospinal fluid from patients with clinical symptoms 
has some limitations. But recently, diagnostic 
testing in the field of medical mycology has 
improved allowing an earlier diagnosis of infection and the possibility to monitor the response to 
therapy in a noninvasive manner. An assay that 
measures 1-3 β-D glucan, a panfungal cell wall 
component, as a potentially promising indicator 
of invasive fungal infection has been developed 
(Obayashi et al. 1995, 2004; Ostrosky-Zeichner et 
al. 2005; Pazos et al. 2005). Although some false 
positives may result from hemodialysis using certain cellulose membranes, gauzes and albumin 
products (Nakao et al. 1997; Sakai et al. 2000; 
Kato et al. 2001), we think that this method is 
useful for the early diagnosis of invasive fungal 
infection. In our experience the specificity of 
β-D glucan was 100%. Besides, it was very 
useful to monitor the results of therapy for 
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. However it 
should also be recognized that β-D glucan is not 
expected to detect cryptoccocosis due to the low 
content of 1-3-β-D-glucan in the cell wall of 
Cryptoccocus species (Miyazaki et al. 1995).
The risk factors for invasive fungal infection 
in liver transplantation have been reported by 
many authors (Gladdy et al. 1999; Avery et al. 
2001; Paya 2001; Fortun et al. 2002; Singh et al. 
2002; Takakura et al. 2004). But these were identified mainly from their experiences with DDLT. 
Therefore, we think that risk factors in LDLT 
recipients should be discussed. In Japan, we have 
experienced more than 3,000 cases of LDLT so 
far (Japan Liver Transplantation Society, personal 
communication), fungal infection is one of the 
fatal complications (Suzuki et al. 2000). In 
DDLT, bile leakage, hepatic artery thrombosis, 
preoperative steroids, blood transfusion during the 
operation, respiratory failure, hyperglycemia, 

214 N. Kawagishi et al. 
retransplantation, and renal failure were reported 
as independent risk factors (Nieto-Rodriguez et 
al. 1996; Gladdy et al 1999; Fortun et al. 2002). 
Some other series identified thrombocytopenia, 
bacterial and viral infections and pre-transplant 
fungal colonization as risk factors (Avery et al. 
2001; Verma et al. 2005). In our series, there 
were no pre- nor intra-operative variables identified as risk factors (except body weight and graft/
recipient ratio) by univariate analysis. This may 
derive from the fact that LDLT is usually set up 
under the condition of elective surgery and prophylaxis for fungal infection is provided before 
transplantation, contrary to what happens in case 
of DDLT. Moreover, donor-transmitted infection 
does not happen in LDLT. Hepatic vein complications and respiratory failure were identified as 
risk factors by multivariate analysis in our series, 
these results were comparable to the reported risk 
factors in DDLT. But we consider that hepatic 
vein complication is a characteristic risk factor for 
LDLT, particularly when the left lobe is used as 
the graft. Because in such cases once hepatic vein 
complications occur, liver damage becomes more 
serious unless proper therapy is provided. This 
kind of serious liver damage is an important risk 
for the development of invasive fungal infection.
In conclusion, invasive fungal infection is an 
important cause of death after LDLT. We identified two factors associated with the development 
of invasive fungal infection : hepatic vein complications and respiratory failure. For the prevention 
and treatment of invasive fungal infection in 
LDLT, it is important to notify these risk factors, 
and we need more studies on early non-invasive 
quantitative markers like β-D glucan.
