Abstract
Owing to the rapid development and wide clinical application of direct acting antiviral (DAA) drugs in the 
treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, the era of interferon-based therapy has almost come to an 
end. Cumulative studies show that DAA therapy renders high cure efficiency (>90%) and good safety 
profile, and may even bring some unexpected benefits to the patients. However, some issues of concern 
arise, one of which is the resistance mutation of HCV genome leading to failure of treatment. With the 
aim of providing some meaningful references for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC), this article 
summarizes the research progress on benefits of DAA accompanied by viral clearance in the treatment of 
chronic hepatitis and the drug resistance.
Key words: hepatitis C virus (HCV), direct acting antiviral (DAA), sustained virological response (SVR), 
resistance-associated substitutions (RAS)
Introduction
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a global 
epidemic. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 71 million people are 
currently living with hepatitis C virus worldwide, 
which is the main cause of chronic hepatitis. The 
number of death from hepatitis C-related liver disease 
has exceeded 399 000 yearly [1]. Nowadays, it is well 
recognized that chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is a major 
public health problem that can contribute to liver 
fibrosis, progressive decline in liver function, and 
ultimately death in patients [1, 2].
As an infectious agent with high sequence 
variations, HCV is classified into seven genotypes 
(GT) and is further subdivided into nearly 100 
subtypes to date. It is recognized that HCV genotypes 
have a regionally distinct global distribution: HCV 
GT1 (46.2%) and 3 (30.1%) dominate the global 
infections; GT 2, 4, and 6 are responsible for 
approximately 22.8% of HCV infections; GT 5 
accounts for the remaining less than 1%; GT 7 has 
been identified so far in very few patients originating 
from Central Africa [3]. 
In the past two decades, the only standard 
treatment for patients with HCV infection is 
peg-interferon plus ribavirin (PegIFN/RBV) in 24 to 
72 weeks, but only a limited proportion of patients 
can achieve a sustained virological response (SVR), 
defined as HCV RNA continues to be undetectable in 
serum at 12 weeks after completing treatment. What is 
worse, the interferon-based agent can cause many 
adverse effects in more than 10% of patients during 
and after the treatment [4], such as depression, 
cytoreduction and hemolytic anemia [5]. Fortunately, 
as DAA drugs have been developed rapidly and used 
in the clinical application, the cure rate of chronic 
hepatitis C has a revolutionary improvement even in 
patients with liver cirrhosis, and the efficiency persists 
to rise from the first generation to the third generation 
DAA drugs [6].
In general, DAAs can be divided into three major 
classes based on their targets in HCV proteins: the 
nonstructural protein 3/4A (NS3/4A) protease 
inhibitors (PIs) that can inhibit HCV polyprotein 
processing; NS5A inhibitors, inhibiting viral

replication and assembly; and NS5B polymerase 
inhibitors that can block HCV RNA replication [7]. 
Specifically, each class of DAA includes several 
different clinical drugs, and nowadays two or three 
DAA combination therapies are recommended and 
clinically adopted.
Moreover, DAA combination therapies can 
achieve high SVR regardless of the HCV GTs and 
subtypes, even in patients with compensatory 
cirrhosis and decompensated liver disease.
Surprisingly, numerous studies have shown that 
DAA can not only effectively and safely remove HCV, 
but also achieve some unexpected benefits when 
compared with interferon-based therapy, such as 
repairing liver function damage, recovery of 
metabolic impairment and restoration of immunity 
dysfunction , etc. caused by HCV infection, and the 
number of patients with adverse effects are much 
lower. However, despite the excellent antiviral 
potency and good compatibility of DAA therapy, the 
consequent challenges such as the association 
between DAA regimen and tumor genesis [8, 9], and 
drug resistance which is the main leading factor to the 
failure of DAA treatments have already attracted the 
attention of many researchers. Therefore, this article 
focuses on the research progress of the extra 
performances of DAA and its drug resistance.
Liver Function Repair
In HCV-infected people, only a minority of those 
can spontaneously recover from HCV infection, 
relying on their strong immunity. More than 70% of 
people will gradually develop chronic hepatitis C 
virus infection, and a considerable proportion of 
patients eventually develop into liver fibrosis, 
cirrhosis, etc. [10-12].
Liver function of more than two-thirds of 
patients will be damaged by HCV infection. 
Clinically, chronic HCV infection will contribute to 
obvious change of some related parameters: high 
concentration of transaminases (alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase), elevated 
bilirubin concentration, elevated serum globulin 
concentration, albumin concentration, and lower 
platelet count. In addition, liver stiffness values and 
Child-Pugh grading standards can be used to 
measure the severity of the related liver disease. These 
data have a positive or negative correlation with the 
severity of liver function damage.
In recent years, mounting clinical trials have 
manifested that successful DAA treatment can not 
only effectively remove HCV, but simultaneously 
repair liver function damage due to HCV infection in 
at least two-thirds of the patients [13]. It appears that 
the parameters related to liver function damage 
gradually approach the normal interval at the end of 
treatment and after a long period of time. For 
example, Edoardo G. Giannini et al. have observed 
significant change of related parameters, which 
demonstrated improvement of liver function in a 
prospective study. In the study, they observed the 
evidently dropped aminotransferases (P < 0.0001), a 
progressive increase in serum albumin (P = 0.010), 
and a decrease in serum bilirubin (P = 0.011) as well as 
in gamma globulin (P = 0.0003) between baseline level 
and that after treatment [14]. A similar change was 
observed in other studies related to DAA and liver 
function repair [15, 16], which confirms this tendency.
Particularly, there are some studies that have 
evaluated global prognostic scores for patients with 
decompensated liver disease, such as the end-stage 
liver disease model (MELD), showing that the liver 
function of about 50% of patients has been improved 
after HCV was removed by DAA. Additionally, these 
improvements of liver function have been made in the 
short term [13, 17]. At the same time, some studies 
have also shown that portal hypertension has also 
improved in subjects with successful DAA therapy, 
which has gradually become an independent 
predictor of hepatocellular carcinoma [13]. Therefore, 
to some extent, DAA treatment can greatly reduce the 
incidence and relapse of hepatocellular carcinoma [18, 
19].
Interestingly, with respect to patients who were 
diagnosed as liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, R. Flisiak et 
al. found that their liver function improvement after 
DAA treatment was often better than that of 
non-cirrhotic patients [15]. The success of DAA 
treatment can reduce the liver stiffness value, which 
means the regression of fibrosis, the down-regulation 
of inflammatory activity and the improvement of 
blood circulation and the regression of hepatic 
steatosis [20]. In another study, Edoardo G. Giannini 
et al. also revealed that at least 85% of patients with 
cirrhosis had a decrease in liver stiffness that dropped 
by about 40%. However, there were still 10% of 
patients who had liver stiffness values enhanced, 
although the virus has been eradicated after DAA 
treatment [17].
In view that most of these conclusions are based 
on the fact that the patient is mono-infected with 
HCV, we wonder whether the DAA treatment has the 
same effect of clearing HCV and repairing liver 
function damage for human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV)/HCV co-infected patients, because it is well 
accepted that the HIV/HCV co-infection greatly 
increases the risk of developing advanced liver 
disease [21-23], and accelerates liver fibrosis in 
patients with chronic hepatitis C[24].First of all, Cure 
rates of over 90%, similar to those in HCV

mono-infected patients, can now be achieved in 
HIV/HCV co-infected patients. This has been 
documented in clinical trials [25-27] as well as in 
real-life cohorts [28-30]. Furthermore, there are also 
studies showing that DAA therapies can achieves 
liver function repair in patients with co-infection. For 
instance, a study by Juan Macías et al. demonstrated 
that DAA treatment also improved liver function 
impairment in co-infected patients, and the degree of 
improvement in liver function was similar to that of 
patients with HCV mono-infection [31]. After 
multivariate analysis, they showed that only baseline 
levels of serum albumin and overall deterioration of 
liver function are independently associated in 
HIV/HCV co-infected patients; in other words, there 
is no significant correlation between the status of HIV 
and the damage and repair of liver function. 
Consequently, it was concluded that patients with 
successful DAA treatment, regardless of whether 
HIV/HCV co-infection or HCV mono-infection, can 
obtain similar recovery of liver function.
Recovery of Metabolic Damage
The association between HCV infection and 
dysregulation of metabolic processes has been 
observed since long ago. Furthermore, chronic HCV 
infection exerts a significant impact on the development of heart disease and stroke [32]. Increasing 
epidemiological studies have long demonstrated that 
the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is 
much higher in subjects with chronic hepatitis C 
(CHC) than in the general population, ranging 
between 13% and 67% according to liver fibrosis stage 
and time of infection [33-35]. 
The hypothesis that HCV has a direct and 
important role in the regulation of glucose metabolism is supported by laboratorial investigations. Kasai 
D et al. showed that HCV replication can downregulate the glucose transporter 2 expressions, which 
located on the surface of the cell, thereby affecting 
cellular uptake of glucose [36]. Deng L et al. found that 
HCV up-regulated hepatic glucose production via 
NS5A-mediated FoxO1-dependent pathway [37]. 
Recently, more systematic mechanisms underlying 
disorders of glucose metabolism caused by HCV 
infection have been observed in many experimental 
and clinical studies. HCV may directly inhibit the 
insulin-signaling pathway, with downregulation of 
glucose transporter 2, promotion of IRS-1 degradation 
through protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of 
rapamycin (mTOR) activation, and suppression of 
phosphorylation of tyrosine on IRS-1. Moreover, HCV 
impairs phosphorylation of Akt, leading to a 
reduction in insulin stimulation [32].
The complex association between HCV infection 
and dysregulation of lipid metabolism has also been 
observed in recent years. Numerous studies have 
shown that HCV is highly dependent on the host’s 
lipid metabolism to create an environment more 
suitable for its replication. HCV associates with 
lipoproteins to form a structure called lipoviral 
particle (LPV), released by hepatocytes [38-40], which 
in turn facilitates HCV evading from host immune 
responses and infecting new cells [40]. Lipid virions 
are very similar to very low-density lipoproteins 
(VLDL), not only by the apolipoprotein content, but 
also by the lipid composition and particle density 
[38-41]. Likewise, VLDL secretion pathway of infected 
cell is redirected by the virus especially for virion 
maturation/secretion, and the low-density 
lipoprotein (LDL) receptor is an essential component 
employed by HCV during cell adsorption and entry 
[42]. Therefore, in HCV-infected patients, lipid 
metabolism is often observed to be down-regulated, 
which is characterized by decreased serum 
lipoprotein and total cholesterol, and substantial lipid 
accumulation [39].
Because of the serious metabolic disorder and 
consecutive related diseases due to HCV infection, the 
question of whether the success of DAA treatment can 
repair the metabolic damage arises. Until now, 
progressing studies have shown that DAA treatment 
has some beneficial impacts on both glucose 
metabolism and lipid metabolism.
Several studies indicated that DAA therapies 
indeed change the state of glucose metabolism in 
patients with the clearance of HCV. However, there is 
a certain contradiction in the results of these studies. 
A retrospective study carried out on 300 patients 
suggested that blood glucose levels significantly 
decreased in subjects with diabetes who achieved 
SVR. And most of the observed variation occurred 
early in time and in temporal concert with HCV 
clearance. Furthermore, the metabolic improvement 
was persistent with a reduction of average fasting 
glucose level for >1 year after the end of therapy 
[32].Consistent with the conclusion, there are some 
studies that reported similar results; a reduction of 
fasting glucose levels after HCV clearance had no 
obvious association with HCV genotype, body mass 
index (BMI) of patients and the DAA regimen used 
[43, 44]. 
In contrast, Philip Weidner et al. discovered that 
SVR is closely associated with the decline of fasting 
blood glucose levels in patients, and this decline will 
continue until 24 weeks after the completion of the 
treatment. However, the fasting blood glucose 
concentration will return to baseline level after 48 
weeks [45]. In addition, a 5-year’s follow-up study by 

Int. J. Med. Sci. 2020, Vol. 17
http://www.medsci.org
895
Jia Li et al. carried out on 384 HCV patients with T2D 
revealed that there was no significant difference in the 
concentration of HbA1c between untreated patients 
and those with treatment failure, whereas the 
variation of concentration of HbA1c in patients with 
successful DAA treatment experienced three stages: 
average HbA1c started off at roughly 7.7 and 
decreased significantly over time (P<0.001); then the 
concentration of HbA1c began to rise slowly 
(P=0.003); finally, HbA1c stabilized at an average 
level of 7.9 (p-value for the slope=0.337) [46].
The contradictory of these results may be 
explained by the length of follow-up after the end of 
treatment as well as different characteristics of 
subjects employed. In summary, a conclusion can be 
drawn that DAA have a positive impact on glucose 
metabolism damage early in time after the completion 
of DAA treatment, but this beneficial effect will 
gradually disappear as the follow-up time is 
extended.
With respect to lipid metabolism impairment in 
patients, unlike the short-term beneficial impact of 
DAA therapies on glucose metabolism, numerous 
studies have supported the hypothesis that HCV 
clearance after therapy is associated with a significant 
improvement in the lipid profile. A study by Gilmar 
de Souza Lacerda et al. found that the level of serum 
total cholesterol (P<0.0001), low density lipid proteinC (P<0.0001), VLDL-C (P=0.0003) and triglyceride 
(P=0.0003) were greatly elevated in patients who had 
acquired SVR at the end of treatment and 1 year after 
the end of treatment, while HDL-C levels in serum 
were not significantly changed, comparing with the 
baseline level [47]. Similar results were observed in 
the study by Matt Driedger et al. They found out that 
post-treatment levels of cholesterol (n=36) and 
triglycerides (n=28) were also evaluated. Overall, a 
numerical increase was observed from baseline in 
both total cholesterol (P=0.06) and triglyceride levels 
(P=0.40). And patients with diabetes were noted to 
have an elevation in cholesterol after treatment 
(P=0.05 by Wilcoxon test; n=10), but no significant 
change in triglycerides (P=0.50 by Wilcoxon test; n=7) 
[48].In line with these results, several clinical studies 
provided strong evidence that lipoprotein levels and 
liver lipid accumulation were inclined to normalize 
after the initiation of combination therapy including 
sofosbuvir/ribavirin, sofosbuvir/ledipasvir, asunaprevir/daclatasvir and grazoprevir/elbasvir. These 
modifications appear to be associated with significant 
improvement of steatosis and atherogenesis [49-53].
Accordingly, these results support the 
conclusion that lipid metabolism damage caused by 
HCV can be completely reversed after DAA 
successfully removes the virus, which can improve 
the liver lipid degeneration and atherosclerosis [32].
To conclude, the question of whether DAA 
treatment can exert a beneficial impact on the 
metabolic impairment can be answered to date: DAA 
indeed can recover lipid metabolism damage, but 
only a short-term positive outcome on glucose 
metabolism damage.

Rehabilitation of Immune Damage
A great deal of studies have shown that HCV 
infection will induce the up-regulation of many genes 
involved in innate immunity characterized by 
up-regulation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) 
expression [54-56], elevated levels of interferonsensitive cytokines and chemokines [53, 57-60]. More 
importantly, the chronic activation of the innate 
immune response and the consequent activation of 
hepatic stellate cells are the initiators of hepatitis and 
cirrhosis [61]. HCV may interact with immunity
response through multiple mechanisms. It is well 
known that HCV RNA can be recognized by the 
Toll-like receptor 3 or the RIG-I helicase-mediated 
pathway in the cytoplasm, resulting in transcriptional 
activation of type 1 interferon. And type 1 interferon 
can activate the JAK-STAT signal pathway, which 
subsequently precedes the transcription of ISGs that 
have antiviral effects [62]. Simultaneously, the 
increased type 1 IFN can also trigger natural killer 
cells and make it a polarized phenotype, elevated 
cytotoxicity, and down-regulation of the proapoptotic factors TRAIL and cytokines [63].
Moreover, in addition to changing innate 
immune response, HCV infection also leads to 
changes in specific immune response. In patients with 
chronic HCV infection, T cell responses can only be 
detected at low levels [64]. This is because sustained 
antigenic stimulation results in up-regulation of T cell 
depletion markers, such as programmed cell death 
protein 1 (PD-1), programmed death-ligand 1 
(PD-L1), T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain 
containing-3 (Tim-3),cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 
4(CTLA-4),CD160, B- and T-lymphocyte attenuator
[65], which indicates the increasing population of 
phenotype of depleted T cells. Ultimately, the 
outcome of changes in the expression of these genes is 
that, partial or total loss of antiviral function and 
proliferation of T cells. This result can also be verified 
in animal models that the population of depleted T 
cell was found to be attenuated after IFN signaling 
[66].
Unlike interferon-based treatments, DAA 
treatment acts precisely on some critical steps of HCV 
replication, thereby preventing HCV replication. It 
plays a role in the treatment of CHC less dependent 
on the host's immune function. Hence, many 
researchers speculate that the dysfunction of CHC 
patient's immune system may be recovered partially 
or completely with the DAA clearing HCV.
To date, there is an extensive body of evidence 
that innate immune and specific immune response 
damage can be recovered in subjects with HCV 
clearance by DAA treatment, and this restoration 
presents long-term effect. According to a study of 
Matthew A. Burchill et al., interferon-free DAA 
treatment can trigger a global rearrangement of innate 
immune signals and inflammatory pathways in 
patients with chronic hepatitis C. They observed an 
obvious reduction in the transcription of the cytokine 
IL1β involved in innate immune activation, hepatic 
inflammation, and fibrosis parallel with the 
deregulated phosphorylation levels of NF-ΚB protein 
that is associated with the activation of downstream 
signaling and innate immune. In addition, the level of 
C-X-C motif chemokine (CXCL)-10 and CXCL 11 also 
decline rapidly during treatment acting as 
chemokines, which can guide the innate immune cells 
to accumulate in the inflammatory part. This 
phenomenon indicates a reduction of the levels of 
HCV RNA in peripheral blood and an amelioration of 
liver inflammation. In addition, the expression of 
innate immune signaling related molecules such as 
retinoic acid induced gene I (RIG-I), Signal 
transducing activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), 
and interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) is downregulated, therefore, the rapid dampening of innate 
immune activation following rapid viral clearance 
with IFN-free DAA therapy is independent of the 
treatment regimen utilized[67, 68].
In fact, the repair of immune dysfunction 
stemmed from DAA therapies changes the expression 
of major immune-related molecules, and the number 
and phenotype of innate immune cells and specific 
immune cells are also changed. Eric G. Meissner et al.
found out that the concentration of lymphocyte in 
peripheral blood was increased dramatically during 
the first two weeks of DAA treatment, but this 
upregulation did not last for the entire treatment 
process. The increase of the population of T 
lymphocytes in peripheral blood can be reflected as a 
combined effect of reduced intrahepatic migration of 
lymphocytes due to changes in chemotaxis and 
potential outflow of intrahepatic lymphocytes [69]. 
The most obvious visual variation over the course of 
treatment was a reduction in CD8 signal in the 
parenchymal and nonparenchymal regions of liver, 
which was observed in all patients who received DAA 
treatment, as well as some patients with treatment 
failure. Hence, this result indicates that the 
frequencies of CD8+T cells may have no correlation 
with the treatment outcome. Similarly, in clinical 
trials, Cody Orr et al. speculated that the decrease of 
population of CD8+ T cells may be due to a decrease 
in HCV concentration, contributing to an intrahepatic 
cellular response to reduction in viral burden. In 
addition, the population of CD4+T cells also declined 
in the non-parenchymal region of liver, while the 
significant variation of frequencies of Kupffer cells 
associated with inflammation was not observed [70].

Furthermore, studies by Shikha Shrivastava et al. 
showed that the expression of depleted T cell markers 
was reduced during DAA treatment, and the 
proportion of exhausted phenotypes T cell was 
obviously declined ,but the proportion of 
HCV-specific CD8+ cells is correspondingly 
heightened. Because the exhausted T cells partially or 
completely lose their ability to secrete antiviral 
cytokines such as IFN-α, IFN-γ, and IL-2. However, 
after successful treatment, compared with baseline 
levels, the expression levels of these cytokines are 
increased in T cells, which mean a recovery to some 
extent in HCV-specific immune response. Thence, 
amplification in HCV-specific CD8+ T cell responses 
is a direct result of decreased expression of T cell 
depletion markers [71]. In addition, 4 years after HCV 
clearance by DAA, a steady growth in the number of 
regulatory T cells was observed in patients, indicating 
that DAA has a sustained effect on immune function 
in the liver for a long period of time after the clearance 
of HCV [72]. Interestingly, however, the memory 
phenotype of CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells did not 
make changes during the course of treatment.
Additionally, it is well documented that patients 
co-infected with HIV and HCV have higher levels of 
immune activation and impaired antigen-specific 
responses compared to patients mono-infected with 
HCV[65].It is important to assess the impact of DAA 
therapies on recovery of immune dysfunction in 
subjects with HIV/HCV co-infection. Several small 
studies have demonstrated improvement in liver ISG 
expression, restoration of type I IFN signaling, and 
natural killer and T cell function following IFN-free 
DAA therapy in the setting of chronic infection 
[73-75].Furthermore, DAA combination therapies in 
patients co-infected with HIV/HCV resulted in 
similar restoration of the T-cell impairments and 
perturbations associated with HIV/HCV coinfection 
to an extent. However, the effect of improvement of 
immune response in patients with DAA treatment is 
different, as the result of Shikha Shrivastava et al. 
shown that patients co-infection with HIV/HCV lead 
to greater restoration of the immunologic outcomes to 
an extent that was greater in three-drug combination 
therapies than that observed in either two-drug 
regimens[65].Consequently, a conclusion can be 
drawn that successful DAA treatment indeed restore 
the dysfunction of immunity system to some extent in 
patients with HIV/HCV co-infection. 
Thus, available results all favored the conclusion 
that immune impairment due to HCV infection and 
HCV/HIV co-infection after the end of successful 
DAA treatment, which is characterized by the 
reduction in proportion of exhausted T cells and 
enhancement of virus-specific T cells response, and 
remarkable amelioration of liver inflammation, can be 
observed in the responders. Furthermore, lacking 
continuous IFN stimulation in the liver after clearance 
of the virus with DAA will likely also have a 
significantly beneficial effect on intrahepatic immune 
responses.

Drug Resistance
Although DAA presents a high SVR for 
HCV-infected patients with the six major genotypes 
(HCV GT3 patients have a slightly lower SVR), it still 
confronts with the challenge of drug resistance, 
especially resistance-associated substitutions (RASs), 
which is the main reason of treatment failure. Drug 
resistance is an intrinsic and unavoidable problem in 
antiviral therapy because of the high adaptability of 
HCV and the failure to maintain a high pressure of 
inhibition [77], and the emergence of RASs will reduce 
the cure rate of the drug.
It is well known that resistance mutations are 
favored by the lack of efficient proof-reading activity 
of HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which 
elevated to be between 103 and 105 per copied base 
pair, as well as the high rate of viral replication (up to 
1012 particles produced per day), leading to one 
mutation for every genome copied. As a consequence, 
HCV exists as a quasi-species population: a complex 
mixture of genetically distinct but closely related viral 
populations that constitutes a reservoir for the 
emergence of resistant strains [78]. Not surprisingly, 
resistance emerges when replication occurs in the 
presence of drug-selection pressure. The probability 
of a mutation associated with drug resistance being 
selected out during therapy relies on the potency of 
that drug. Undoubtedly, in addition to the RASs 
emerging after virological failure, there are some 
resistance mutations that occur naturally before 
treatment, which both have a negative effect on cure 
rate, and may eventually resulting in treatment 
failure. In general, there are many factors associated 
with the occurrence of RASs, including therapy 
regimen, genotype and subtype of HCV and 
geographical distribution.
Encouraging clinical and retrospective study 
have shown that the prevalence of RASs in the gene 
regions of three non-structural proteins of HCV is not 
the same, and this may be due to their different roles 
in HCV life cycle, which determines the resistance
barriers of the three non-structural proteins of HCV 
are different (the genetic barrier to drug resistance 
defines as the types and number of mutations needed 
to develop the resistant phenotype [79]). Therefore, 
there is a difference in prevalence of the resistance 
associated mutations that selected from DAA administration among these three non-structural proteins.
RASs at positions 53, 80, 122, 155 and 168 within 
the NS3 protease region are often associated with 
virological failure with PIs [80]. Mechanically, 
emergence of RASs to reducing the cure rate of PIs is 
mainly due to the changes of the conformation of viral 
proteases, which makes it more difficult for PIs to 
stably bind to drug targets, ultimately resulting in a 
decrease in SVR. For example, when simeprevir 
(TMC435) is used for the treatment of HCV infection, 
the conformation of R155 is good for facilitating its 
interaction with the simeprevir crystal structure. 
Moreover, a salt bridge network structure formed 
between Q80, R155 and D168 is vital to stabilizing this 
interaction. Nevertheless, the mutation of R155K 
caused the salt bridge structure to fail to form, which 
reduces the stability of interactions of drug and 
protease. Thus, mutations in R155K, D168A, and 
Q80K ultimately contribute to the effect of simeprevir 
escaped by NS3 [81].
NS5A inhibitors are an indispensable component 
of all first-line DAA regimens as they are the class of 
HCV drugs where resistance is most clinically 
relevant. With respect to NS5A inhibitors, it works 
mainly by binding to domain 1 of the NS5A dimer, 
but the specific mechanism of inhibition still remains 
unclear. The RAS of M/L28T/V, Q/L30E/H/R/S, 
L31M/V, H58D and Y93C/H/N are the most 
frequently in NS5A when the patients are treated with 
NS5A inhibitors [82].Considering the above, RASs of 
M28A/G/T/V are most frequently in GT1a prior to 
drug exposure (4–8% M28T/V), and Y93 variants 
(Y93C/H/N) of NS5A RASs have the most clinical 
importance (< 7×),which are found most frequently 
in GT1b (10%) and GT3 (8–10%) but appear rarely in 
GT1a (< 1%). However, the Variants at position 93 in 
GT1a can confers very high level resistance to all class 
NS5A inhibitors except for pibrentasvir (PIB) (< 7×) 
[83, 84]. The occurrence of RASs leads to a decrease in 
the affinity of the NS5A inhibitor and NS5A, which 
finally compromises its effectiveness.
The spectrum of mutations associated with NS5B 
inhibitors is likewise broad. Similar to HIV therapy, 
HCV polymerase inhibitors also can be subdivided 
into two types: nucleosides (NIs) and non-nucleoside 
inhibitors (NNIs). Because all NISs target the highly 
conserved active sites of polymerases, these inhibitors 
tend to be pan-generic [85]. In the course of treatment 
with NIs, the most important compound from this 
class is sofosbuvir. In pre-clinical assessment of 
sofosbuvir, a serine to threonine substitution at 
position 282 of polymerase (S282T) conferred a 10-fold 
resistance against sofosbuvir [86]. The in vitro analysis 
of the S282T variant showed that the affinity of the 
mutated polymerase for nucleoside analogs was 
reduced, and this substitution also resulted in a 
significant loss of replication fitness [87]. Nonnucleoside inhibitors bind to allosteric binding sites 
outside the polymerase active site, and their resistance 
barriers are lower compare with NIs. Dasabuvir is 
currently the only approved non-nucleoside inhibitor. 
For dasabuvir, the common RASs in NS5B are M414T 
and S556G [88], or A421V and P495L/S [89].

In addition to these common resistance 
mutations, several prevalence studies have 
demonstrated that there are still some RASs 
pre-existing prior to the treatment within the viral 
population of an infected patient. Although not as 
common as the RASs merging under drug selective 
pressure, baseline resistance may also affect the 
outcome of DAA therapy.
As epidemiological studies have shown that 
Q80K RAS in NS3 is associated with significantly 
lower SVR rates for treatment with SMV + peg-IFN-α
+ RBV[90], existing as a natural polymorphism mainly 
in HCV GT1a (20 – 52%) [91]. In particular, the 
presence of Q80K is an especially challenge in G1a 
infected patients with cirrhotic, as they treated with 
SMV + SOF, lower SVR rates of 74% were observed in 
the presence of Q80K versus 92% in the absence of 
Q80K [92]. Therefore, monitoring of Q80K before 
treatment is recommended in all subjects with HCV 
GT1a infected, especially treatment with SMV + 
peg-IFN-α + RBV, while for therapy regimen of SMV 
+ SOF, baseline resistance testing of Q80K is needed 
only for cirrhotic patients [93].
Variants at positions 31, 54 and 93 are most 
common in NS5A, including L31M, Q54H and Y93H 
[94]. For the combination regimen of ASV + DCV, the 
NS5A variant Y93H was pre-existed in half of the G1b 
infected patients who went through treatment failure. 
In contrary to this result, in a UNITY-1 study, despite 
the higher frequency of NS5A RASs was observed 
prior to treatment in GT1b compared to GT1a infected 
patients (16% vs 11%), all subjects with GT1b infection 
achieved SVR in contrast to only 74% for GT1a [95,
96].Nevertheless, a recent study showed an exciting 
result that the impact of baseline NS5A RASs on 
outcome of treatment can be significantly reduced or 
even completely removed when patients go through a 
longer duration of treatment with SOF + LDV and 
addition of RBV[96]. Furthermore, pre-existing RASs 
in NS5A appeared to have little effect on the outcome 
of treatment regimen with SOF + VEL, in spite of a 
high frequency of such variants, 97–100% subjects 
with baseline resistance in NS5A achieved SVR [97, 
98].
Variant L159F in NS5B was detected in 1% of the 
subjects with GT1 infection and was only observed to 
have a direct association with accumulated virological 
failure when patients were treated with SOF + RBV 
for short durations [99]. Unlike low prevalence and 
limited effect of L159F in GT1, 34% prevalence of RAV 
L159F was observed in GT1b and was significantly 
associated with dropped SVR rates of 25% as opposed 
to 65% in patients without this variant [100]. In 
general, a low prevalence of pre-existing RASs was 
detected in nucleoside inhibitor based regimens [101].

The prevalence of RASs is different among the 
major genotypes and subtypes of HCV, and it may 
due to various resistance barriers of them. For 
example, the most frequent RAS is Y93H in subjects 
with HCV GT3 and GT1b infection, but rarely 
observed in patients with HCV GT1a infection [78]. In 
addition, a protease inhibitor-related R155K-resistant 
mutation in the NS3 protein requires only one 
nucleotide change (AGG to AAG) in GT1a HCV 
infected patients as opposed to the occurrence of 
R155K RAS requires two nucleotide changes (CGG to 
AAG) in HCV GT1b infected subjects who initiated 
therapy with a protease inhibitor. As a result, variant 
at position 155 is lowering prevalent in HCV G1b 
infected subjects compared to the G1a infected 
subjects due to higher resistance barrier [78].
Therefore, it remains necessary to detect the 
HCV genotype and subtype of a patient. Because a 
correct HCV genotype/subtype determinate by 
baseline HCV sequencing can provide critical 
virological information for the detection of genetic 
variants that have a potential impact on therapy 
response, which can guide the selection of the optimal 
antiviral regimen for patients and decrease frequency 
of treatment failure.
In addition, encouraging epidemiological studies
have demonstrated that the prevalence of RAS is also 
related to geographical distribution, resulting in some 
of more frequent mutations in some places. 
Statistically, the overall prevalence of Q80K is 7.5%, 
decomposed into19.8% in GT1a, 0.5% in GT1b, and 
18.2% in other or unknown GT1 subtypes [102].
Furthermore, the prevalence of Q80K among GT1 
patients may be geographically various: the 
prevalence of Q80K was 34% in a North American G1 
population and reached more than 40% in subjects 
who infected HCV GT1.In Europe, Q80K prevalence 
in GT1 ranged from 0% in Bulgaria to 18.2% in the 
UK. But the prevalence was various from country to 
country owing to different Q80K prevalence and 
ratios of G1a/G1b within the G1a genotype [102].
In summary, the drug resistance of DAA is 
associated with a variety of factors, and RASs can be 
detected in all patients with treatment failure. Thus, 
the detection of RASs is critical for the success of 
treatment, including the RASs naturally occurring 

Int. J. Med. Sci. 2020, Vol. 17

and selected out during therapy. Until now, the 
detection of drug resistance mainly relies on Sanger 
automated sequencing and second-generation 
sequencing (NGS), and NGS is an emerging 
technology with great potential in data analysis and 
data integrity [78]. Of note, international guidelines 
recommend that RAS present in >15% of sequences 
are believed clinically significant and should be taken 
into serious consideration in the selection of treatment 
regimen [102, 103].Conversely, in a RAS study based 
on massively parallel, they reported that presence of 
baseline RASs even much less than 15% of HCV 
sequences is also associated with treatment failure in 
two HCV G1a-infected patients treated with 
ledipasvir (LED)+ sofosbuvir (SOF) [67, 104-106]. 
Thus, the drug resistance of DAA is a complex 
and unavoidable problem, which may result in bad 
response to antiviral therapy and relapse in HCV 
infected patients. To date, with the aim of decreasing 
frequency of RASs, it is useful and common to select 
different classes DAAs for combination treatment. 
And a correct determination of HCV genotype and 
subtype and detection of pre-existing RASs in 
sequence remains important for guiding selection of 
most appropriate antiviral regimen.
Conclusion
The combination, oral DAA (±RBV) therapies 
have become the clinical treatment of choice, which 
has revolutionized cure rate for patients with HCV 
infection. In addition to the excellent antiviral effect 
that more than 91% SVR can be achieved in patients, 
there are some unexpected effects of recovery in liver 
dysfunction, metabolic disorder and immune function 
damage in patients with clearance of HCV compared 
to IFN-based therapy. However, presence of baseline 
resistance and RASs occurring during antiviral 
treatment is critical and notable a challenge, which 
can be observed in all patients with treatment failure. 
Therefore, with the aim of reduction of frequency in 
RASs and non-responders, selection of DAA therapies 
should be taken with many factors into consideration,
including correct determination of HCV genotype and 
subtype and detection of RAS in sequence. Thus, the 
exploitation of antiviral drugs suitable for the all main 
HCV genotypes, to minimize the incidence of 
resistance mutations in order to further improve the 
sustained viral response, remains a focus of future 
research and with a great pool of knowledge based on 
profound researches, more effective therapies are 
hoped to emerge.
