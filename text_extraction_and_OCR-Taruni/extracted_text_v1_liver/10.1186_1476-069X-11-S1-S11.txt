Abstract
Background: Many epidemiological studies and reviews have been performed to identify the causes of bladder
cancer. The aim of this review is to investigate the links between various environmental risk factors and cancer of
the bladder.
Methods: A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Scholar Google and
Russian Google databases to identify reviews and epidemiological studies on bladder cancer risk factors associated
with the environment published between 1998 and 2010. Only literature discussing human studies was considered.
Results: Smoking, mainly cigarette smoking, is a well known risk factor for various diseases, including bladder
cancer. Another factor strongly associated with bladder cancer is exposure to arsenic in drinking water at
concentrations higher than 300 µg/l. The most notable risk factor for development of bladder cancer is
occupational exposure to aromatic amines (2-naphthylamine, 4-aminobiphenyl and benzidine) and 4,4’-
methylenebis(2-chloroaniline), which can be found in the products of the chemical, dye and rubber industries as
well as in hair dyes, paints, fungicides, cigarette smoke, plastics, metals and motor vehicle exhaust. There are also
data suggesting an effect from of other types of smoking besides cigarettes (cigar, pipe, Egyptian waterpipe,
smokeless tobacco and environmental tobacco smoking), and other sources of arsenic exposure such as air, food,
occupational hazards, and tobacco. Other studies show that hairdressers and barbers with occupational exposure
to hair dyes experience enhanced risk of bladder cancer. For example, a study related to personal use of hair dyes
demonstrates an elevated bladder cancer risk for people who used permanent hair dyes at least once a month, for
one year or longer.
Conclusion: Smoking, in particular from cigarettes, exposure to arsenic in drinking water, and occupational
exposure to aromatic amines and 4,4’-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) are well known risk factors for various diseases
including bladder cancer. Although the number of chemicals related to occupational exposure is still growing, it is
worth noting that it may take several years or decades between exposure and the subsequent cancer.
Background
Bladder cancer is the 10th most common cancer worldwide, with the highest rates reported in Europe, North
America and Australia, and accounting for an estimated
261 000 new cases diagnosed and 115 000 deaths each
year; by comparison, relatively low rates are found in the
Far Eastern countries [1,2]. In Europe, bladder cancer is
the 5th most commonly diagnosed cancer type and the
9th leading cause of cancer mortality [2]. It affects men
more frequently than women [3]. Typical of solid tumours,
bladder cancer incidence increases with age. Tumours of
the bladder rarely occur before the age of 40 – 50, arising
most commonly in the seventh decade of life [4,5]. The
median ages at diagnosis are 69 years for men and 71 for
women [6].

Histologically, most cases of bladder cancer are transitional cell carcinomas (90 %); 70 % of these are superficial and papillary subtypes [7]. The less common types
are squamous cell carcinoma (3 - 5 %); adenocarcinoma
(0.5 to 2 %); small cell carcinoma (less than 0.5 %); and
sarcoma, carcinosarcoma/sarcomatoid tumours, paraganglioma, melanoma and lymphoma (less than 0.1 %)
[8]. Haematuria, i.e., frequent urination and pain during
urination, are the most common symptoms of bladder
cancer [4].
The aim of this review is to investigate the links
between environmental risk factors and bladder cancer.
Examples include the effect of different types of smoking (cigarette, cigar, pipe and environmental tobacco
smoking); the effect of arsenic in drinking water, air,
food, occupational hazards, and tobacco; and the effect
of occupational exposure to aromatic amines (2-
naphthylamine, 4-aminobiphenyl and benzidine) and
4,4’-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) that can be found in
chemical, dye and rubber industries as well as in hair
dyes, paints, fungicides, cigarette smoke, plastics, metal
and motor vehicle exhaust in relation to bladder cancer.
Methods
A systematic literature search was performed using
PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Scholar Google and
Russian Google databases to identify reviews and epidemiological studies on bladder cancer risk factors associated with the environment published between 1998
and 2010. Only literature discussing human studies was
considered.
Results
Smoking
Smoking is a well known risk factor of chronic lung disease, heart disease and various types of cancer including
bladder cancer [9,10]. Several epidemiological studies
and reviews describe the impact of cigarette, cigar, pipe
and environmental tobacco smoking.
Cigarette smoking is the primary risk factor for bladder cancer [3,6,11]. In a recent meta-analysis of 43 published case-control and cohort studies, Zeegers et al.
[12] concluded that current cigarette smokers have an
approximately threefold higher risk of bladder cancer
than non-smokers. In a combined analysis of 11 casecontrol studies from six European countries, risk for
bladder cancer increased with duration of smoking
(number of years smoked) and intensity of smoking
(number of cigarettes smoked per day) [3,13,14]. The
age- and gender-adjusted summary odds ratios for current and former cigarette smokers compared with those
for non-smokers were 3.33 (95 % confidence interval
(CI), 2.63 – 4.21) and 1.98 (95 % CI 1.72 – 2.29),
respectively [4]. The Netherlands Cohort Study the
associations between cigarette smoking and bladder cancer risks were studied in detail [15]. Zeegers et al. [15]
found out that the tar and nicotine content of cigarettes,
and filter-tip usage were only weakly associated with
bladder cancer risk. Cancer of the urinary bladder has a
relative risk associated with tobacco use of 3.0; the relative risk for pancreas cancer associated with tobacco use
is 2.0 – 4.0 [11].
Given convincing evidence for a substantially
increased risk of bladder cancer for cigarette smokers,
Zeegers et al. [4] calculated the etiologic fraction of
cigarette smoking which accounts for 23 % of all female
bladder cancer, whereas in men 50 % of the cancer is
attributed to cigarette smoking.
Risk depends on the method of tobacco smoking: pure
cigarette smokers were at higher risk (95 % CI 2.9 – 4.2)
than pure pipe smokers (95 % CI 1.2 – 3.1) or pure cigar
smokers (95 % CI 1.6 – 3.5) [16]. The effect of cigar smoking may be limited to people who inhale [17]. Furthermore, Iscovich et al. [18] suggested that users of black
tobacco have a two to three times higher risk than users of
Virginia tobacco. In the Netherlands Cohort Study, Zeegers et al. [4] confirmed a substantially increased risk of
bladder cancer for current cigar (95 % 1.68 – 4.93) and
pipe smokers (95 % 1.67 – 5.50) versus those who have
never smoked tobacco. However, the evidence of an association between bladder cancer risk and Egyptian waterpipe and smokeless tobacco use is rarely reported [3].
The precise mechanism by which cigarette, cigar and
pipe smoking causes bladder cancer has yet to be determined. Zeegers et al. [4] assumed that the risk of bladder cancer is related to some of the large number of
chemicals present in smoke, such as 2-naphthylamine
and 4-aminobiphenyl, leading candidates for the specific
etiologic agents. On the other hand, cigar and pipe smokers inhale less than cigarette smokers, which can
explain an increased cancer incidence for cigar and pipe
smokers in local areas of the human body (such as head
cancer, neck cancer) and no increased risk through a
systemic effect (such as bladder cancer) [4].
The relationship of environmental tobacco smoking has
been investigated only in a few studies [4,19,20]. Kabat et
al. [21] reported data from a population-based US case
control study where no significant risk of bladder cancer
in either sex was seen when comparing 84 non-smoking
cases and 266 hospital controls [19]. In a large Japanese
prospective study no significant increased risk was
observed in the wife associated with the husband’s smoking [22]. A population-based case-control study was conducted in Canada [23]. Risk of bladder cancer was not
increased in relation to environmental tobacco smoking
exposure at home or at work [19].
There is good evidence that stopping smoking reduces
the rate of recurrence for many cancers [24]. For bladder

cancer, Aveyard et al. [25] examined 15 studies that
showed evidence that continued smoking or a lifetime of
smoking constitutes a moderate risk factor for recurrence
and death, and that stopping smoking could favourably
change this. However, the evidence base for this is weak
because of the methodological shortcomings and because
most results of the studies were not statistically significant [25].
Arsenic in drinking water
Arsenic, a naturally occurring metalloid found in air, soil
and water, exists in both organic and inorganic states.
Whereas organic forms are considered non toxic, inorganic
forms are toxic [26]. In countries such as Bangladesh,
China, Hungary, and India, among others, arsenic is found
at high concentration in ground water and surface soil [27].
There is strong evidence for a link between bladder
cancer and exposure to arsenic (As) in drinking water at
concentrations exceeding 300 – 500 µg/l [1,28]; however,
there seems to be no elevated risk with As concentrations
below 200 µg/l [29], except for the smokers [30]. On the
other hand, Meliker and Nriagu [1] reported that health
risks from As exposure in the 10 – 100 µg/l range are
not obvious. Given low-to-moderate concentrations of
As in drinking water, other sources of As exposure such
as air, food, occupational hazards, and tobacco may be
important [1,28,30]. Exposure to other potential bladder
carcinogens in drinking water, such as disinfection
byproducts or nitrates, along with mediating factors in
the diet, such as selenium and zinc, may also prove to be
decisive factors [1]. On the other hand, Kurttio et al. [31]
reported in a Finnish study that in spite of very low As
exposure levels (0.5 µg/l) they found evidence of a link
between As and bladder cancer risk and provided evidence for synergistic effects of smoking and nutritional
factors with As.
The mechanism of arsenic-induced bladder cancer
remains unclear. Arsenic inhibits indirectly sulfhydryl containing enzymes and interferes with cellular metabolism
such as cytotoxicity, genotoxicity and inhibition of
enzymes with antioxidant function [32]. On the other
hand, the p53 protein may be involved in the development
of bladder cancer. In a Taiwanese study, bladder tumours
from people chronically exposed to As showed mutations
in the p53 gene at codon 175 and transitions at points 9
and 10 [30]. However, in a South American study, Moore
et al. [33] did not find evidence that As exposure was associated with an increased prevalence of p53 mutations or
immunopositivity of p53 protein in bladder cancer.
There is also evidence that the process of arsenic carcinogenesis may be modulated by genetic differences in
DNA repair [34]. Andrew et al (2009) [34] observed
gene-environment interaction of 549 controls and 342
cases with arsenic exposure in relation to bladder cancer
risk for a variant allele of the double-strand break repair
gene XRCC3 T241M (odds ratios (OR) adjusted for age,
gender, smoking status (former and current): OR 2.8 (1.1
– 7.3)).
Occupational exposure
Aromatic amines
The most notable risk factor for the development of
bladder cancers is occupational exposure to aromatic
amines, first noted in England over 100 years ago. The
compounds 2-naphthylamine, 4-aminobiphenyl and benzidine can be found in the products from the chemical,
dye and rubber industries as well as in hair dyes, paints,
fungicides, cigarette smoke, plastics, metal and motor
vehicle exhaust and pollutant emissions from industrial
installations [35-38].
In 1954, Case et al. [39] reported a 200-fold increased
bladder cancer risk for English and Welsh workers
exposed to 2-naphthylamine. In the cohort study performed on more than 11 000 workers in the rubber industry, elevated standardised mortality ratios (SMR) for
bladder cancer were observed for “storage and shipment”
(SMR 253; 95 % CI 93-551) and for “general work” in this
industry (SMR 159; 95 % CI 92-279) [40].
4-aminobiphenyl, carcinogenic aromatic amine, present
as a carcinogenic component of tobacco smoke is also
used in the rubber industry. In a study involving 171
workers in the rubber industry, 19 cases of bladder cancer
were observed [40].
Benzidine, used in dye production and the rubber industry, has been identified as the most important carcinogenic
aromatic amine regarding human bladder damage. 92 of
331 workers of one of the most important industrial facilities in Leverkusen, Germany, who had been exposed to
benzidine production before 1967, eventually contracted
bladder cancer [40]. In a Chinese cohort study, where 784
workers were exposed to benzidine, a 35-fold increased of
bladder cancer risk was observed [41].
Individuals with occupational exposure to hair dyes such
as hairdressers and barbers experience enhanced risk of
bladder cancer although it is unclear if other lifestyle
aspects are responsible for the increase in bladder cancer
risk [36]. In a large population-based case-control study in
Los Angeles, personal use of hair dyes was assessed
according to the types of hair dyes normally used and
compared with people who did not use hair dyes [42]. An
elevated bladder cancer risk (odds ratio (OR) 1.9; 95 % CI
1.1 -3.3) was claimed for those who used permanent hair
dyes at least once a month, for 1 year or longer. The risk
increased to 3.3 (95 % CI 1.3 – 8.4) for those who used
permanent hair dyes at least once a month for 15 and
more years. Hairdressers who performed their jobs for
more than 10 years showed a 5-fold increased risk (95 %
CI 1.3 – 19.2) [40].

Firefighters exposed to a long list of carcinogens in combustion products including asbestos, polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons, benzene, lead and aromatic amines have
been shown to be at increased risk of developing a number
of cancers including multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma, prostate cancer, testicular cancer leukemia,
skin cancer, malignant melanoma, brain cancer, and
cancer of the rectum, colon, stomach, buccal cavity and
pharynx [43].
4,4’-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) (MBOCA)
4,4’-methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) (MBOCA) is a synthetic
chemical widely used in industry primarily to produce
castable polyurethane parts. Most exposure to MBOCA
occurs in the workplace; the workers may inhale small
particles of MBOCA in the air or absorb MBOCA dust or
vapor through the skin [37]. In a Taiwanese study, a total
of 70 MBOCA-exposed workers and 92 non-exposed
workers were screened for bladder cancer. The study identified a proven bladder carcinoma in MBOCA-manufacturing factories; a worker with suspected malignant cells;
and a worker with atypical cytology combined with gross
hematuria. The findings of this study support the conclusions from other studies that MBOCA is potentially carcinogenic to humans and control measures (such as issuing
work clothing that must not be worn at home; requiring
to shower at the end of the work shift; and improving the
ventilation system) are needed to prevent overexposure
from inhalation and skin absorption [37].
It has been estimated that the occupational exposures
are responsible for 18 % of bladder cancer cases.
2 years’ exposure may be sufficient to increase this risk,
but the time between exposure and subsequent cancer
may be several decades [37].
Conclusion
In this review, we investigated the associations of the
environmental risk factors with bladder cancer. Smoking,
in particular cigarette smoking, is a well known risk factor
for various diseases including bladder cancer. The effects
of other type of smoking (cigar, pipe, Egyptian waterpipe,
smokeless tobacco and environmental tobacco smoking)
have been investigated only in a few studies. The precise
mechanism of smoking-induced bladder cancer has yet to
be determined. Another factor strongly associated with
bladder cancer is exposure to arsenic in drinking water at
concentrations higher than 300 µg/l. Other sources of
arsenic exposure such as air, food, occupational hazards,
and tobacco may be important, but there are not enough
studies to allow demonstration of a link. The mechanism
of arsenic-induced bladder cancer remains unclear. The
most notable risk factor for the development of bladder
cancers is occupational exposure to aromatic amines (2-
naphthylamine, 4-aminobiphenyl and benzidine) and 4,4’-
methylenebis(2-chloroaniline) that can be found in the
chemical, dye and rubber industries as well as in hair dyes,
paints, fungicides, cigarette smoke, plastics, metal and
motor vehicle exhaust. Although the number of chemicals
related to occupational exposure is still growing, it is
worth noting that it may take several years or decades
between exposure and the subsequent cancer.
