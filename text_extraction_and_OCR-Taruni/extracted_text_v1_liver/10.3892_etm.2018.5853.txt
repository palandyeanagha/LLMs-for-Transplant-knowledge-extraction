Abstract. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 
and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways are activated during pathogenesis of gastrointestinal stromal tumors 
(GISTs). Forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) is a transcription factor regulated by the MAPK and PI3K pathways and 
is associated with multiple metabolic reactions. The present 
study aims to investigate the association of FOXO1 with cell 
proliferation and apoptosis in the cell line, GIST-T1. Cell 
counting kit-8 assay revealed that cell growth was inhibited 
by the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, and/or MAPK inhibitor, 
UO126. Western blotting demonstrated that the expression 
of p‑FOXO1 and B‑cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) were significantly reduced, whereas the expression of Bcl-2-associated 
X protein was significantly increased following treatment 
with LY294002 and/or UO126 (all P<0.05). However, no 
significant change was revealed in the level of total FOXO1. 
Flow cytometry revealed that apoptosis was significantly 
increased by the pathway inhibitors (P<0.05). Specifically, 
the proportion of cells in the G1 phase was increased whereas 
the proportion in the S phase was reduced. The changes of 
protein expression and cell apoptosis were more evident in 
the LY294002 + UO126 group than in either single-inhibitor 
group. The results indicated that FOXO1 was able to affect 
cell proliferation, apoptosis and the cell cycle of GISTs. 
The regulation of FOXO1 was part of the PI3K and MAPK 
signaling network, while this regulation was mostly activated 
by phosphorylation of FOXO1.
Introduction
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) were initially classified 
by Mazur and Clark in 1983 (1), and represent a wide spectrum 
of mesenchymal tumors in the entire gastrointestinal tract (2). 
GISTs are most commonly observed in the stomach and small 
intestine, followed by the colon, rectum and esophagus. They 
typically occur in individuals >50 years old and the incidence 
of GISTs is 10-20 individuals in a million (3). A notable feature 
of GISTs is that mutations within the KIT or platelet-derived 
growth factor receptor (PDGFR) genes exist in the majority of 
cancer cells (4). Normally, c-KIT activation requires binding 
to its ligand, stem cell factor (SCF). Interaction between c-KIT 
and SCF activates a cascade of downstream reactions, whereas 
mutations in the KIT gene lead to uncontrolled activation of 
the tyrosine kinase domain and promoted cell proliferation (5). 
Activation of KIT is crucial for the pathogenesis of the majority 
of GISTs (6), which makes this oncoprotein a potential therapeutic target. Furthermore, imatinib and other tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors are typically used to treat GISTs (7).
The downstream signaling pathways that are known to 
be activated by KIT include the RAS/mitogen-activated 
protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 
(PI3K)/protein kinase B networks (8,9). Forkhead box 
protein O1 (FOXO1) is a member of the FOXO transcription 
factors, which has been demonstrated to be closely associated 
with cell apoptosis, DNA damage or repair, cell autophagy, 
oxidative stress, angiogenesis and sugar metabolism (10-12). 
Furthermore, the PI3K and MAPK networks are key signaling 
pathways that regulate FOXO1 expression (13). A previous 
study demonstrated that high expression of FOXO1 is able to 
inhibit cell proliferation (14). However, the potential association 
of FOXO1 expression in GISTs remains unclear. The present 
study was designed to investigate the regulatory mechanism 
by which the PI3K and MAPK signaling pathways influence 
the activity of FOXO1 and its downstream factors, B-cell 
lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax).

tumor cell line was purchased from Biowit Technologies, Ltd. 
(Shenzhen, China) and the WI‑38 normal lung fibroblast cell 
line was obtained from Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry 
and Cell Biology (Shanghai, China). The media used for 
cell culture [Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), 
minimum essential media (MEM) and fetal calf serum] 
were purchased from Gibco (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., 
Waltham, MA, USA).
Cell culture and treatments. GIST-T1 cells, characterized 
in detail by Taguchi et al (15), were cultured in DMEM and 
WI-38 cells (ATCC® CCL-75™) in MEM. Both media were 
supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and maintained at 
37˚C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 and 95% 
air. The GIST-T1 cells were maintained in the log-growth phase 
and treatment groups were treated with 30 µM LY294002 
(LY294002 group), 10 µM UO126 (UO126 group) or 30 µM 
LY294002 + 10 µM UO126 (LY+UO group) at 37˚C for 24 h. 
An equal amount of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) was added 
into the control group and incubated at 37˚C for 24 h.
Immunocytochemistry and immunofluorescence staining. 
GIST-T1 cells were seeded into six-well chamber slides at a 
density of 1x104 cells/well and allowed to adhere. Subsequently, 
1 ml medium was added to each well and cultures were maintained at 37˚C for 24 h, then washed and fixed with acetone 
at 4˚C for 20 min. Cells were permeabilized with 0.5% 
Triton X-100 for 20 min. To inhibit endogenous peroxidase 
activity, slides were incubated at 37˚C with 3% H2O2 for 
10 min, washed with PBS and blocked with 5% bovine serum 
albumin (Biosharp, Anhui, China) at room temperature for 
30 min. Excess serum was removed with filter paper, and the 
primary c-Kit antibody (1:500) was added and incubated at 
4˚C overnight. Following washing three times with PBS for 
5 min each, the HRP-labeled Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (1:50) or 
DyLight 405-labeled Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (1:200) was added 
and incubated at room temperature for 30 min and washed 
three times with PBS for 5 min each. For peroxidase staining, 
color was developed using 3,3'-diaminobenzidine, slides were 
washed to terminate the reaction and then nuclei were counterstained with hematoxylin at room temperature for 30 sec. 
For immunofluorescence staining, nuclei were counterstained 
with DAPI at room temperature for 15 min, slides were dried 
and then sealed with neutral resin. Slides were observed under 
a light or a fluorescence microscope (magnification, x400) and 
images were captured.
CCK‑8 cell proliferation assay. A single-cell suspension of 
GIST-T1 was seeded into 96-well plates at 1x105 cells per 
well and treated with inhibitors as described above. Following 
treatment for 0, 12, 24, 36 or 48 h, 10 µl CCK-8 reagent was 
added, samples were incubated at 37˚C and 5% CO2 for 1 h 
and agitated gently to ensure any precipitate was dissolved. 
The absorbance of each well was measured with a microplate 
reader, at an absorption wavelength of 450 nm. With the 
measured optical densities (ODs), the following formula was 
used: Inhibition ratio (%)=(OD value of control group-OD 
value of experimental group)/OD value of control group x100.
Western blotting. Cell cultures were treated as described 
above. At the end of the culture period, the total protein was 
extracted from the cells in 100 µl extraction buffer (10 mM 
Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, 0.1% Triton X-100 containing 
complete protease inhibitor cocktail). A bicinchoninic acid 
protein assay kit (Pierce; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) was 
used to estimate the protein content of the lysate with bovine 
serum albumin used as the standard. SDS loading buffer 
[63 mM Tris-HCl, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.0025% bromophenol blue, (pH 6.8)] was added following normalization of 
the concentration of protein in each sample with 1% SDS. 
Protein lysates (30 µg) were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and 
electrophoretically transferred onto PVDF membranes (EMD 
Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Membranes were blocked 
with 5% non-fat dry milk (w/v) in TBST buffer (10 mM Tris, 
150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20) at room temperature for 
1 h, and incubated overnight with primary antibodies against 
FOXO1 (1:1,000), p‑FOXO1 (s256; 1:1,000), Bcl2 (1:1,000), 
Bax (1:1,000) or β‑actin (1:2,000) at 4˚C. Subsequently, blots 
were washed three times with TBST and incubated with 
HRP-conjugated secondary antibody against IgG (1:3,000) 
at room temperature for 1 h. Enhanced chemiluminescence 
substrate followed by exposure within an EpiChemi II darkroom (UVP, Inc., Upland, CA, USA) was used for visualization 
of the protein bands. Quantity One software v4.62 (Bio-Rad 
Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) was used to analyze 
the bands and quantify the signal.
Apoptosis assay by flow cytometry. Cultured GIST-T1 cells 
were treated and collected as described above. Apoptosis was 
analyzed to investigate whether LY294002 and UO126 were 
able to enhance cell killing sensitivity. The apoptotic rates 
were measured using a flow cytometric assay. Cell labeling was 
performed using Annexin V conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), which binds to phosphatidylserine exposed 
on the surface membrane of cells undergoing apoptosis. Cells 
were collected by trypsinization, washed twice with PBS and 
centrifuged at 500 x g, room temperature for 5 min. The cells

were then suspended in 500 µl PBS and incubated with 5 µl 
Annexin V‑FITC (Annexin V‑FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit; 
Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Haimen, China) and 10 µl 
(20 µg/ml) propidium iodide (PI) solution (Beyotime Institute 
of Biotechnology) at room temperature for 20 min in the dark. 
The samples were then measured using a flow cytometer with 
FACS 101 software (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). 
For each sample, 105 fluorescence signals were measured.
Cell cycle distribution assay by flow cytometry. GIST-T1 cells 
were treated and collected as described above, then fixed in 
75% ethanol for 2 h at 4˚C. Samples were rehydrated with PBS 
and incubated with 500 µl (200 µg/ml) PI solution for 30 min 
at room temperature. For each sample the percentages of cells 
in the G0/G1, S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle were calculated using a flow cytometer with FACS software. For each 
sample, 10,000 fluorescence signals were measured.
Statistical methods for data analysis. SPSS 20.0 software 
(IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) was used for statistical 
analysis of experimental data. The results are expressed as the 
mean ± standard deviation. P<0.05 was considered to indicate 
a statistically significant difference. Differences between 
groups were determined by one-way analysis of variance with 
Dunnett's post hoc test.
Results
Confirmation of cell type by immunocytochemistry. 
Immunocytochemical staining of cultured GIST-T1 cells with 
an anti-c-Kit antibody revealed brown granules in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1). The presence of this gastrointestinal stromal 
tumor cell marker indicated that the cells cultured in the 
present study were from a gastrointestinal stromal tumor.
Cell proliferation is inhibited by signaling inhibitors. CCK-8 
staining revealed that the inhibition of cell proliferation was 
enhanced with treatment time in the LY+UO group (P<0.05; 
Fig. 2). Inhibition of cell proliferation inhibition in the LY+UO 
group was more pronounced compared with groups treated 
with either inhibitor alone (P<0.05; Fig. 2). Furthermore, 
maximal inhibition was observed when cultures were treated 
with LY294002 or UO126 for 24 h, whereas inhibition peaked 
at 36 h in the LY+UO group, at which time-point the majority 
of cells were dead (Fig. 2).
Western blotting analysis. Western blotting revealed that the 
expression of FOXO1 and Bax significantly decreased, whereas 
p‑FOXO1 and Bcl2 significantly increased in GIST‑T1 cells 
compared with the normal human fibroblasts WI‑38 (P<0.05; 
Fig. 3A). To confirm that protein expression was regulated 
via the PI3K or MAPK pathways, the cells were treated with 
pathway inhibitors. The protein expression of p-FOXO1 and 
Bcl2 was significantly decreased (both P<0.05), whereas Bax 
(P<0.05) increased in cells treated with LY294002, UO126 or 
both compared with controls. The reduction in the expression 
of p-FOXO1 and Bcl2 and the increase in protein expression 
of Bax were more marked in the LY+UO group; however, 
total FOXO1 protein expression was not significantly different 
among the groups treated with LY294002, UO126, LY+UO or 
DMSO (Fig. 3B).

Immunofluorescence staining of FOXO1 distribution. 
Immunofluorescence staining revealed that FOXO1 was widely 
distributed in the nucleus and cytoplasm in the DMSO group. 
Treatment of GIST-T1 cells with LY294002 or UO126 resulted 
in cytoplasmic levels of FOXO1 being markedly reduced, with 
a corresponding increase in nuclear FOXO1. Furthermore the 
degree of FOXO1 translocation to the nucleus in the LY+UO 
group was more pronounced than in either single-inhibitor 
group (Fig. 4).
Apoptosis is induced by signaling inhibitors. Cells in the 
control group exhibited an apoptosis rate of 1.17±0.21%. In the 
LY294002-treatment group the apoptosis rate was 2.05±0.32% 
whereas in the UO126-treated group it was 2.66±0.53%. 
Additionally, in the LY+UO group the apoptosis rate was 
3.82±0.47%. These results demonstrated a significantly 
increased apoptosis rate (P<0.05) when treating GIST-T1 cells 
with LY294002 or UO126, and the effect of combined treatment was higher than that of either inhibitor alone (Fig. 5).
Signaling inhibitors alter the cell cycle distribution. Flow 
cytometry revealed that the proportion of G0/G1 phase cells 
in the LY294002, UO126 and LY+UO groups was 79.78±5.27, 
73.73±4.86 and 87.28±6.27%, respectively. These proportions 
were increased significantly compared with the control group 
at 65.43±4.35% (all P<0.05). The percentages of S phase 
cells in three treatment groups were 18.65±2.17, 26.27±3.14 
and 12.6±1.73%, respectively. The percentages were also 
significantly decreased compared with the control group 
(32.17±3.10%; P<0.05). The effect of combination treatment

was significantly greater than either inhibitor alone (Fig. 6; all 
P<0.05).
Discussion
The pathogenesis of GISTs is closely associated with uncontrolled cell proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis (16). The 
PI3K and MAPK pathways serve a vital role in the pathogenesis of GISTs (17). Hyperactivation of the PI3K pathway is 
associated with constitutive autophosphorylation of c-KIT and 
cancer growth (9). The present study confirmed that the PI3K 
and MAPK pathways were associated with cell proliferation 
and apoptosis, and the cell cycle of GISTs. Furthermore, a 
previous study indicated that the activation of these pathways 
may be differential. However, the PI3K pathway appears to 
be activated to a greater extent than the MAPK pathway in 
wild-type GIST tissues and PDGFR mutants(17). Additionally, 
activation of the PI3K pathway, rather than the MAPK 
pathway, was also associated with drug-resistance to imatinib 
in GISTs (18). The results of the present study demonstrated 
that the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, had a stronger growth 
inhibition effect than the MAPK inhibitor, UO126. However, 
the regulatory effect of p-FOXO1, Bcl2 and Bax was more 
evident by UO126 than by LY249002. The difference between 
phenotypes and molecular expression indicated that regulation 
of other molecules may also be responsible.
The PI3K and MAPK signaling pathways are important regulators of FOXO1 (13). FOXO1 is an important 
transcription factor that is associated with the regulation 
of cell proliferation and apoptosis. The results revealed,

that compared with normal fibroblasts, total FOXO1 was 
suppressed and p-FOXO1 was increased in GIST cells. These 
results indicated that regulation of FOXO1 was associated 
with GISTs. Furthermore, a recent study also reported that 
downregulation of FOXO1 promoted cell proliferation in 
cervical cancer (11). The activity of FOXO1 may be regulated 
by phosphorylation, acetylation and other modifications (11). 
The results of the present study indicated that the PI3K and 
MAPK pathways regulated FOXO1 by phosphorylation rather 
than by changing the expression level. Similar results have 
also been reported previously where studies have demonstrated that the PI3K and MAPK inhibitors were able to 
inhibit the phosphorylation of FOXO1 and its translocation to 
the nucleus, and thereby inhibit the transcriptional activity of 
FOXO1 on downstream factors (19-21).
Previous studies have demonstrated that FOXO1 is 
associated with the regulation of Bcl2, Bax and other apoptosis-related factors (13,22). Furthermore, overexpression of 
Bcl2 inhibits apoptosis, whereas overexpression of Bax is 
able to promote apoptosis (23). Phosphorylated FOXO1 is 
able to upregulate Bcl2 and downregulate Bax expression 
to inhibit apoptosis (24,25). Consistent with those previous 
reports, an increased Bcl2 expression and suppressed Bax 
expression along with increased p-FOXO1 was also observed 
in GIST-T1 cells in the present study. However, treating 
GIST-T1 cells with LY249002 and UO126 was able to inhibit 
the activation of FOXO1 into p-FOXO1, and thereby lead to 
increased apoptosis rate and arrested cell cycle at the G0/G1 
phase.
In conclusion, regulation of FOXO1 by the PI3K and MAPK 
pathways was associated with the pathogenesis of GISTs. 
The downregulation of total FOXO1 and hyperactivation of 
p-FOXO1 was associated with cell proliferation, apoptosis 
rate and altered cell cycle in GIST-T1 cells. Furthermore, the 
phosphorylation of FOXO1 was activated by the PI3K and 
MAPK pathways. Therefore, further study of the role of the 
transcription factor FOXO1 in GISTs is required, as it may 
provide a novel direction for the development of targeted 
therapy drugs.
