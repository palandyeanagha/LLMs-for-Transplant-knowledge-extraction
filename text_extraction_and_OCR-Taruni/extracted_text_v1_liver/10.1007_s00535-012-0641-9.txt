Abstract
Background We investigated whether the administration
of maintenance doses of interferon prevented hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic hepatitis C.
Methods Study 1: A multicenter, retrospective, cooperative study was carried out to determine whether longterm administration of low-dose peginterferon alpha-2a
(PegIFNa-2a) prevented HCC development in patients with
chronic hepatitis C. In total, 594 chronic hepatitis C
patients without a history of HCC were enrolled and treated
with 90 lg PegIFNa-2a administered weekly or bi-weekly
for at least 1 year. Study 2: HCC developed in 16 of 99
additional patients without PegIFNa-2a treatment during
3.8 years of observation. A propensity-matched control
study was then carried out to compare the incidence of

HCC between the 59 patients who received low-dose
PegIFNa-2a (PegIFNa-2a group) and 59 patients who did
not receive PegIFNa-2a treatment (control group), matched
for sex, age, platelet count, and total bilirubin levels.
Results Study 1: HCC developed in 49 patients. The risk
of HCC was lower in patients with undetectable hepatitis C
virus RNA, B40 IU/L alanine aminotransferase (ALT), or
B10 ng/L alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) 24 weeks after the start
of therapy. Study 2: The incidence of HCC was significantly lower in the PegIFNa-2a group than in the control
group.
Conclusions Low-dose and long-term maintenance
administration of PegIFNa-2a decreased the incidence of
HCC in patients with normalized ALT and AFP levels at
24 weeks compared with patients without normal ALT and
AFP levels.

Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the sixth most common
cancer worldwide, often develops because of long-term
hepatitis B or C virus infection [1, 2]. In particular, chronic
hepatitis C and hepatic cirrhosis increase the risk of HCC;
the annual incidence of tumor development in such patients
may be as high as 2–4 % [3–5]. The incidence of HCC
decreases in patients who achieve a sustained virological
response (SVR) to interferon (IFN) treatment, although the
incidence remains high in non-SVR patients [6–9]. A
detailed analysis of HCC development revealed that
chronic hepatitis C patients aged 65 years or more, especially those with advanced fibrosis of the liver, were at an
increased risk of developing HCC [10]. For patients
65 years or older with advanced liver fibrosis, the dose of
ribavirin is often reduced or the agent is discontinued,
resulting in lower SVR rates in those with discontinuation
of ribavirin. Establishing an effective treatment strategy for
preventing the development of HCC is important for these
high-risk patients.
Factors related to the development of HCC have been
analyzed in patients who did not achieve an SVR even after
IFN treatment; advanced fibrosis of the liver and high
levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alphafetoprotein (AFP) are risk factors for HCC development
[11, 12]. A randomized controlled trial was conducted in
Western countries to determine whether combined peginterferon and ribavirin treatment with weekly administration
of 90 lg peginterferon alpha-2a (PegIFNa-2a) could prevent HCC in non-responders. A 3.5-year follow up showed
that administration of a maintenance dose of PegIFNa-2a
did not reduce tumor incidence in these patients [13].
However, after 8.5 years of observation, the incidence of
HCC was decreased among those in the PegIFNa-2a group
with cirrhosis [14]. Meanwhile, Bruix et al. [15] reported
that maintenance therapy with PegIFNa-2b did not prevent
HCC in chronic hepatitis C patients with cirrhosis. In
Japan, long-term low-dose administration of natural IFN
has been reported to decrease the incidence of HCC [16].
In light of these conflicting results, investigations should be
carried out in a large number of patients with chronic
hepatitis C to resolve the question of whether IFN treatment prevents the development of HCC.
We carried out a multicenter retrospective cooperative
study of patients with chronic hepatitis C to determine
whether those treated with 90 lg PegIFNa-2a without
ribavirin had a reduced incidence of HCC compared with
those not treated with IFN.
Patients and methods
Study 1: analysis of risk factors for HCC in patients
treated with long-term low-dose-PegIFNa-2a
In total, at 21 hepatitis centers throughout Japan, 743
patients with hepatitis C who had received 90 lg of PegIFNa-2a therapy weekly or bi-weekly for 1 year or more
without having received the full dose (180 lg) since
December 2003 were examined retrospectively for the
development of HCC. The end of enrollment in this study
was the end of December 2008 and the end of follow up
was the end of December 2010. Patients with a history of
HCC before the start of therapy and those with a therapy
period of less than 48 weeks were excluded, leaving 594
patients who had undergone long-term administration of
PegIFNa-2a for analysis. At the 21 centers involved in this

study, 4,753 patients with chronic hepatitis C had been
treated; Peg-IFN and ribavirin combination treatment had
been administered to 3,877 patients, 743 patients had
received Peg-IFN alone, and 133 patients had not agreed to
receive IFN (a flow diagram of the enrollment of patients in
this study is shown in Fig. 1). In the patients with Peg-IFN
and ribavirin combination treatment, the SVR rate was
43.8 %; SVR was not achieved in 2,179 patients, and in
776 of these patients, the combination therapy was discontinued owing to adverse events or the patient’s choice.
Patients who failed to achieve an SVR were not included in
this study, because the incidence of HCC is known to be
reduced even in non-responders to IFN [17].
The backgrounds of the 594 patients studied are shown
in Table 1. Findings from the liver biopsies of the patients
were classified according to international standards [18].
Long-term PegIFNa-2a treatment is approved by the Japanese Medical Insurance system. Written informed consent
was obtained from all patients prior to participation in this
study. The study design was approved by the regional
ethics committees of the 21 centers involved in this study,
including the Musashino Red Cross Hospital, in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. The 743 patients
treated with PegIFNa-2a alone were not indicated for PegIFNa and ribavirin combination therapy because of anemia
or heart disease. The 133 patients who did not agree to
receive IFN served as the control group (see Fig. 1). A
large proportion of the 594 study patients had advanced
fibrosis of the liver and active inflammation. A dose of
90 lg PegIFNa-2a was administered to 512 and 82 patients
weekly and biweekly, respectively, according to the
patients’ wishes. There were no significant differences
between the weekly and biweekly groups in the patients’
background data (data not shown).
The median duration of follow up in the PegIFNa-2a
group was 1,273 days (range 228–2,768 days) and HCC
was observed in 49 of the 594 patients (Table 1). Pretreatment and on-treatment factors associated with the
development of HCC were analyzed by Student’s t-test, the
Mann–Whitney U-test, and the v2 test (Table 2). Independent factors for the development of HCC were assessed
by multivariate analysis using logistic regression. The

incidence of HCC was analyzed according to the ALT,
AFP, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA levels 24 weeks after
the start of PegIFNa-2a administration by using the Kaplan–
Meier method. The risk of HCC was analyzed, using the
Kaplan–Meier method, only in the non-responders with
detectable HCV RNA during PegIFNa-2a administration by
dividing them according to the ALT and AFP levels 24 weeks
after the start of therapy. The incidence of HCC was compared between the patients with ALT levels of\41 IU/L and
those with levels of C41 IU/L, and between patients with
serum AFP levels of \10 ng/L and those with levels of
C10 ng/mL at 24 weeks after starting treatment, because at
most of the centers participating in the this study, the upper
normal range of serum ALT is set at 40 IU/L, and the most
significant difference in the incidence of HCC was observed
between the PegIFNa-2a and control group with the cut-off
serum ALT set at 41 IU/L and cutoff serum AFP set at 10 ng/
mL, 24 weeks after starting treatment. The HCV RNA level
was measured using the Amplicor Monitor method with a
lower detection limit of 50 IU/L (Roche Diagnostics, Tokyo,
Japan). A history of excess alcohol consumption was determined as[60 g alcohol per day in order to exclude alcoholic
liver disease.
An asymptomatic carrier was defined as a patient with a
serum ALT level within the normal range and minimal
inflammation or fibrosis in the biopsied tissues of the liver.
Chronic hepatitis was defined as mild-to-severe fibrosis of
the liver according to liver biopsy [18]. The diagnosis of
liver cirrhosis was based on the results of histological
examination of the biopsied liver tissues.
Study 2: incidence of HCC in the PegIFNa-2a therapy
and non-administration (control) groups in comparison
with propensity-matched controls
Ninety-nine of the 133 chronic hepatitis C patients who had
not received IFN were examined as controls; patients in
this group received liver-protective agents such as glycyrrhizin or were untreated, and the group was observed for
more than 1 year. None of the individuals in the control
groups had received IFN alone or PegIFNa and ribavirin
combination treatment. They were treated for a median of
1,395 days (range 75–6,556 days). Fifty-nine of these
patients underwent liver biopsy before the treatment and
were considered the control group for the propensity-matched study. For the propensity-matched study, 59 patients
were selected from the PegIFNa-2a group according to
their age, sex, platelet count, and total bilirubin levels,
which had been identified as independent pretreatment risk
factors for the development of HCC in Study 1. The rates
of HCC were analyzed using the Kaplan–Meier method,
and the risk of HCC was analyzed particularly in patients
with advanced fibrosis of the liver (F3 and F4).
Statistical analysis
Categorical data were compared using the v2 test or Fisher’s exact test. The distributions of continuous variables
were analyzed using Student’s t-test and the Mann–Whitney U-test for two groups. Multivariate analysis was

conducted using logistic regression. The cumulative incidence curve was determined using the Kaplan–Meier
method and differences between groups were assessed by
the log-rank test. For all methods, the level of significance
was set at p\0.05. Multivariate analysis of the risk of
HCC was carried out using the Cox proportional hazard
model. Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software version
11.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). In Study 1, age, sex,
platelet count, and total bilirubin levels were identified as
independent factors for the development of HCC; therefore, these factors were selected for the propensity-matched
control study (Study 2) in which 59 patients from the
PegIFNa-2a group were included.
Results
Study 1
We analyzed the factors involved in the development of
HCC in patients who received 90 lg PegIFNa-2a weekly
or biweekly for more than a year. The incidence of HCC
did not differ significantly between the groups treated with
PegIFNa-2a weekly and biweekly (34 of 512 vs. 15 of 82,
respectively). As shown in Table 2, univariate analysis
revealed statistically significant differences in the pretreatment parameters including age, sex, fibrosis of the
liver, platelet count, albumin level, and total bilirubin,
between patients who developed HCC and those who did
not. Endoscopy was carried out in 375 patients, and
esophageal varices were noted in 31 of them. The incidence of HCC was higher in patients with esophageal
varices than in those without varices [29.0 % (9 of 31) vs.
6.4 % (22 of 344)]. Assessment of on-treatment factors by
univariate analysis revealed statistically significant differences in serum ALT, AFP, and HCV RNA levels 24 weeks
after the start of PegIFNa-2a maintenance treatment (Table
2).
Multivariate analysis including pretreatment parameters
revealed that age, sex, fibrosis of the liver, platelet count,
and total bilirubin were independent risk factors for HCC
development (Table 3). Multivariate analysis including ontreatment parameters identified ALT levels of C41 IU/L
and AFP levels of C10 ng/L 24 weeks after the start of the
PegIFNa-2a therapy as independent risk factors for HCC
development (Table 3).
The incidence of HCC was significantly lower in patients
with ALT levels of B40 IU/L than in those with ALT levels
of C41 IU/L 24 weeks after the start of observation (Fig. 2).
The incidence of HCC was also significantly lower in patients
with AFP concentrations of\10 ng/mL at 24 weeks after the
start of observation than in those with AFP concentrations of
C10 ng/mL (Fig. 3). The dose of PegIFNa-2a was reduced to
45 lg in 16 patients because of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. In addition, PegIFNa-2a was discontinued in 18
patients because of adverse events, including depression (7
patients), interstitial pneumonitis (3 patients), thrombocytopenia (3 patients), neutropenia (1 patient), itching (1 patient),
and ascites (3 patients). No statistically significant differences were found between the patients with reduced dosage
or treatment interruption and those without treatment modifications with respect to overall survival, HCC incidence,
ascites formation, variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy,
and 2-point increases in the Child-Pugh score. No patients
underwent liver transplantation.

Study 2
We compared the incidence of HCC between 59 patients in
the control group and the same number of patients in the
PegIFNa-2a group using the matched-pair test. The backgrounds of the patients are shown in Table 4. The PegIFNa-2a group had higher rates of advanced fibrosis (F3
and F4) and active inflammation (A2 and A3). No other
differences were found between the two groups, except for
the white blood cell count (Table 4).
Development of HCC was observed in 2 patients in the
PegIFNa-2a group and 8 in the control group. The incidence of HCC was compared between the two groups,
using the Kaplan–Meier method. The incidence of HCC in
the PegIFNa-2a group was significantly lower than that in
the control group (log-rank test, p = 0.0187; Fig. 4).
Among the patients with advanced fibrosis of the liver (F3
and F4), those in the PegIFNa-2a group had a lower incidence of HCC than those in the control group. The independent risk factors for the development of HCC were
analyzed using the stepwise Cox proportional hazard
model. Only PegIFNa-2a administration and age were
identified as independent risk factors for the development
of HCC (Table 5).
Discussion
The number of HCC cases resulting from HCV infection
continues to increase worldwide [19]. To date, IFN therapy
is the most effective preventive measure against HCC in
patients with chronic hepatitis C; furthermore, the
incidence of HCC is reduced in patients who achieve an
SVR to IFN [6–9] Therefore, achieving an SVR is the most
effective approach for reducing the risk of developing
HCC. In Japan, the incidence of HCC is elevated in older
patients with hepatitis C. Corroborating this finding, the
results of a Japanese study show a higher risk of HCC in
patients aged 65 years and more [10]. Therefore, prevention of HCC in aged patients is an important challenge.
In the present multicenter, cooperative, retrospective
study conducted in Japan, the incidence of HCC was
reduced in patients who received 90 lg PegIFNa-2a
weekly or biweekly and had AFP values of\10 ng/mL and
ALT values of B40 IU/L 24 weeks after the start of the
treatment. The results of the matched case–control study of
the PegIFNa-2a group and the non-IFN control group show
that the incidence of HCC was significantly lower in the
PegIFNa-2a group than in the control group, especially in
patients with advanced fibrosis of the liver (F3 and F4).

the PegIFNa-2a group and the control group (patients who
did not agree to receive IFN treatment), because this was a
retrospective and non-randomized study. However, concordant with the findings of the HALT-C study [14], the
present results show that PegIFNa-2a inhibits the development of HCC in patients with advanced fibrosis of the
liver.
Recent studies show that polymorphisms in the host
IL28B gene are important factors in the response to PegIFNa and ribavirin combination therapy [20, 21]. However,
the mechanism of IL28B involvement in the response to
PegIFNa and ribavirin has not been elucidated completely.
A recent report has shown that IL28B is a significant factor
in the development of HCC as well as in the response to
IFN therapy [22]. Further studies are warranted to analyze
the relationship between IL28B and inhibition of the
development of HCC by PegIFNa in chronic hepatitis C.
Risk factors for the development of HCC have been
discussed previously. Increased intrahepatic fat is involved
in the development of HCC in chronic hepatitis C patients
[23, 24]. In addition, diabetes-associated fat disorder [25,
26], hepatic iron overload [27], advanced fibrosis, older
age, and fatty deposits in the liver are risk factors for HCC
development [4]. Therefore, it is important to establish
strategies to mitigate these risk factors to prevent the
development of HCC and thus improve the outcomes of
hepatitis C patients.
IFN therapy after HCC treatment is reported to inhibit
the recurrence of tumors [28, 29], and a meta-analysis has
revealed a trend toward inhibition of the recurrence of
HCC [30, 31]. The prevention of HCC is an important issue
that needs to be addressed to improve the survival of
chronic hepatitis C patients. The findings of the present
study and the HALT-C trial [14] indicate the effectiveness
of long-term administration of maintenance IFN for preventing the development of HCC in chronic hepatitis C
patients without an SVR. Improvement in ALT levels is
also known to be an important predictor for the prevention
of HCC [32]. A low AFP value during IFN administration
is also recognized as a significant indicator of a lower risk
of HCC [33, 34]. Recently, Osaki et al. [35] reported that a
decrease of serum AFP during treatment with IFN was
associated with a reduced incidence of HCC. Taking these
findings and our own together, we conclude that maintenance administration of low-dose PegIFNa-2a weekly or
biweekly to non-SVR patients with chronic hepatitis C
decreases the incidence of HCC, especially in patients
whose serum ALT and AFP levels are within the normal
range 24 weeks after the start of treatment. The preventive
effects of IFN against the development of HCC without
elimination of the virus may be associated with its anticarcinogenic effects [16, 35]; however, the precise mechanism should be investigated.
The limitations of the present study are that it is retrospective and multicentric; therefore, potentially there may
have been a selection bias. However, the reduction of the
rate of development of HCC by maintenance administration of PegIFNa-2a in the patients in whom serum ALT
and AFP levels were within the normal ranges 24 weeks
after the start of treatment may be attributable to the
anticarcinogenic effects of IFN without elimination of the
virus.
Conclusion
The incidence of HCC was lower in non-SVR patients with
chronic hepatitis C who were administered with maintenance low-dose PegIFNa-2a; especially in those whose
serum ALT and AFP levels were within the normal ranges
24 weeks after the start of treatment.
