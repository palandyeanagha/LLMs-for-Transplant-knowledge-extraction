Abstract
Congenital nephrotic syndrome (CNS) is a heterogeneous group of disorders presenting with massive proteinuria within the
first 3 months of life almost inevitably leading to end-stage kidney disease. The Work Group for the European Reference
Network for Kidney Diseases (ERKNet) and the European Society for Pediatric Nephrology (ESPN) has developed
consensus statement on genetic aspects of CNS diagnosis and management. The presented expert opinion recommends
genetic diagnostics as the key diagnostic test to be ordered already during the initial evaluation of the patient, discusses
which phenotyping workup should be performed and presents known genotype–phenotype correlations.
Introduction
Congenital nephrotic syndrome (CNS) is a heterogeneous
group of disorders presenting in utero or during the first
3 months of life with marked edema and massive proteinuria [1]. In the vast majority of cases, CNS is a primary
glomerular disorder due to genetic defects; occasionally it
can however be caused by congenital infections or alloimmune maternal disease [2].
Originally, the disorder has been referred to as the
Finnish-type nephrotic syndrome due to its high incidence
in Finland (1:8.000 live births), with two NPHS1 founder
mutations (i.e., Fin-major and Fin-minor) in most cases These authors contributed equally: Lipska-Ziętkiewicz Beata Stefania,

[3–5]. However, over the years several other genes have
been implicated in the CNS etiology when mutated, both in
isolated cases or in the the less common syndromic forms of
the disease [6–8].
NPHS1 (encoding nephrin) or NPHS2 (encoding podocin)
biallelic pathogenic variants are the most common causes of
the disease in patients of both European and other descents.
Among syndromic forms, WT1-associated glomerulopathy is
the most frequent, followed by Pierson syndrome caused by
LAMB2 biallelic pathogenic variants [6–14]. The exact data
on the prevalence of CNS in various populations are limited.
With the advent of massive-parallel sequencing, rapid-WES
usage in daily clinical practice in particular, it is anticipated
that the information on the associated mutational spectrum
and the incidence of various types of hereditary CNS will be
soon achieved. Public lists of disease-causing variants are
available online (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/; www.lovd.
nl; www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk). Also, online case consultations,
including discussion of variants in question, are available via
the European Rare Kidney Disease Reference Network
(http://www.cpms.erknet.org).
CNS management is very challenging due to high morbidity and mortality rates [15]. Patients with CNS are prone
to severe complications related to hypoproteinemia such as
recurrent infection, thrombosis, and impaired growth and
most progress to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) within a
few years [1, 5, 16].
In 2018, the European Reference Network for Kidney
Diseases (ERKNet) and the European Society for Pediatric
Nephrology (ESPN) have jointly established a Work Group
to develop recommendations for clinical diagnostics, management and treatment of CNS. This resulted in clinical
recommendations for CNS (Boyer et al. in prep.) and the
present consensus statement on genetic aspects of CNS
diagnosis and management.
Because evidence is frequently missing or inadequate in
CNS management, this article is an expert opinion paper
rather than a clinical practice guideline. Detailed methodology, including formulation of PICO (Patient or Population
covered, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome) questions,
approaches to literature search and three-step revision process
is presented in the parallel clinical paper (Boyer et al. in prep.).
Content list—questions addressed in the presented
recommendations:
1. Which phenotyping workup should be performed?
2. What is the preferred time-point for genetic diagnostics?
3. What is the appropriate genetic testing approach?
4. Is there a role for karyotyping?
5. What kind of samples are needed for genetic testing?
6. Is there a role for prenatal diagnosis/genetic
counseling?
7. What are the phenotype/genotype correlations?
8. How to manage syndromic forms?
9. What is the inheritance pattern of a hereditary CNS?
10. Parents as kidney donators.
1. Which phenotyping workup should be performed?
In addition to standard clinical care phenotypic workup
in infants with CNS (Boyer et al. in prep.) we recommend
additional evaluation with the aim of identifying extrarenal
signs and symptoms suggestive of an underlying genetic
disease.
Clinical examination should be performed to identify the
possible extrarenal manifestations of a hereditary form of
CNS. Table 1 summarizes possible phenotypic manifestations of syndromic forms of CNS.
Particular attention should be paid to neurological
examination, including brain imaging in selected cases.
Abnormal cerebral gyration or cerebellar atrophy in
Galloway–Mowat syndrome (GAMOS) [17–19]; cerebral
and cerebellar atrophy and stroke-like lesions in CoQ10
nephropathies [20–22]; ventriculomegaly in patients with
CRB2-glomerulopathy [23] and subcortical changes in
patients with SGPL1 biallelic pathogenic variants [24] have
been described. Ophthalmological examination and hearing
evaluation should also be performed in all cases.
2. What is the preferred time-point for genetic diagnostics?
We recommend genetic testing as a first choice diagnostic test in every CNS patient. It should be performed as
part of the initial patient evaluation and should be considered prior to a renal biopsy.
Once the clinical suspicion of CNS is raised, genetic testing
should be initiated. Genetic testing in CNS is a fast, noninvasive and reliable one-time diagnostic measure. Prompt
genetic testing has profound effects on clinical decision making
as it reduces the time for diagnosis in infants during hospital
stay and may enhance the cost-effectiveness of clinical management [25, 26]. Establishing the genetic diagnosis is essential
for proper patient management, facilitates the anticipation, and/
or swift identification of extrarenal manifestations, informs
recurrence risk counseling, and may lead to the identification
of genetic defects that may represent phenocopies of nephrotic
syndrome [27]. As a general rule, in genetic forms of CNS the
use of immunosuppressive drugs should be avoided; instead,
appropriate fluid management and proteinuria-lowering RAAS
(renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system) blockade at postneonatal age should be introduced promptly to stabilize the
patient’s condition and slow renal failure progression (see
Boyer et al. in prep. for further details). Particular issues around
therapeutic decision making in syndromic forms are discussed
further in Question 8. These include but are not limited to (1)

being aware of the risk of urogenital tumors and meticulous
monitoring of them in WT1-associated disease; (2) promptly
initiating CoQ10 supplementation in CoQ10-related nephropathies; (3) planning appropriate therapy in GAMOS individuals or subjects with CRB2 or SGPL1-associated disorders;
(4) managing endocrine manifestations in individuals with
SGPL1 or WT1-related syndromes.
3. What is the appropriate genetic testing approach?
We recommend one- or two-step genetic testing
depending on the presenting phenotype and financial and/or
technical restrictions related to the diagnostics.
Genetic screening strategies might vary depending on
country specific peculiarities including availability and
access to genetic testing and reimbursement policy of
national healthcare systems (Fig. 1).
In CNS, basic genetic screening of NPHS1, NPHS2, WT1,
and LAMB2 genes will uncover underlying genetic abnormalities in >80% of cases. Several other less commonly
mutated genes account for an additional ~5% of diagnoses
[6, 7, 9, 10, 28, 29]. Due to the wide range of phenotypic
variability and genetic heterogeneity of the disease
[6, 7, 9, 14, 28, 29] a comprehensive genetic screening
comprising all SRNS-related genes is recommended as the
first tier method using next generation sequencing technology

with either an expanded gene panel or whole exome
sequencing (WES). Targeted gene panels have higher depth
of coverage of the genes related to a specific phenotype,
which allow a higher diagnostic rate. Also, gene panels will
not yield incidental findings in genes unrelated with CNS.
However, the number of genes that can be examined using a
gene panel approach is limited and the covered list of genes
should be regularly updated as new genes are continuously
identified. Conversely, WES allows detecting variants not
only in an established list of known, but also in novel diseasecausing genes [30]. However WES has also some important
limitations. Complex rearrangements, small copy-number
variants and changes within regulatory fragments (promotor,
introns, enhancers, silencers etc) might be missed by standard
protocols. In particular, WES may have suboptimal coverage
of some clinically relevant regions: fragments with high GC
content, the mitochondrial genome or duplicated regions
(pseudogenes) [31]. These limitations may, to some extent, be
overcome by use of hybridization-based custom target
enrichment for NGS gene panels.
For patients who present a clear phenotype associated with
a syndromic form of CNS, testing the particular related gene
can be performed as the first step followed by comprehensive
genetic testing if no pathogenic variant is detected. In populations where founder mutations or specific genetic abnormalities have already been well described such as CNS of the
Finnish type (NPHS1 Fin-major and Fin-minor recessive
pathogenic variants), the genetic screening strategy may be
modified considering population specific features.
Informed consent should be obtained before initiating
genetic studies. Informed consent forms should clearly
describe the methods that will be applied, and the interpretation and handling of results and incidental findings that
would have clinical and psychosocial impacts, for instance
male-to-female sex-reversal related to WT1 dominant
pathogenic variants.
4. Is there a role for karyotyping?
We recommend karyotype testing to be performed in
each CNS patient with ambiguous genitalia and in each
phenotypic female with a causative WT1 mutation.
Establishing chromosomal gender of a patient with CNS
with ambiguous genitalia and/or a WT1 dominant pathogenic variant is necessary for further proper management,
endocrine and oncological follow-up in particular [32, 33].
For karyotype testing, a heparin blood sample should be
obtained according to local genetic laboratory
recommendations.
5. What kind of samples are needed for genetic testing?
We recommend performing genetic testing on whole
blood (EDTA) or umbilical cord tissue/blood sample.
A blood sample for genetic testing should be obtained as
soon as possible as it informs further clinical management
of a CNS patient. However, in those patients who have
individual blood-sampling limitations or less than 3 months

from a blood transfusion, buccal swabs or newborn dried
blood spots may also be used [34, 35].
6. Is there a role for prenatal diagnosis/genetic
counseling?
We recommend prompt genetic counseling in families
with a past history or prenatal signs of CNS.
In families with a past history of CNS, recurrence risk
counseling by a clinical geneticist/clinical counsellour
should be promptly provided. The decision regarding preimplantation genetic diagnosis and prenatal genetic testing
should be discussed in light of the local financial, social,
and legal settings [36].
7. What are the phenotype/genotype correlations?
We suggest to take the following phenotype–genotype
information into account for genetic counseling:
NPHS1
The majority of patients in whom CNS manifests in the first
week of life will harbor biallelic pathogenic variants in
the nephrin gene [10, 14]. The frequency of the disorder
is significantly higher in Finland with two NPHS1
founder mutations (i.e., Fin-major and Fin-minor) in most
cases [3–5]. Renal pathology does not exclusively appear as
“Finnish type” NS in CNS caused by recessive NPHS1
pathogenic variants [37]. There is no difference between
truncating NPHS1 variants (i.e., nonsense, frameshift, and
splice site) and missense NPHS1 variants in terms of age at
diagnosis, proportion of age at ESKD or death, and proportion of patients who achieved at least transient albumin
withdrawal [38]. A subset of patients with CNS and a milder
clinical course were described associated with the
NM_004646.3: c.3478C>T(p.(Arg1160Ter)) variant [10, 39].
PLCE1
Patients with PLCE1 (NM_016341.3) splice site recessive
pathogenic variants have an earlier age of onset than
patients with C-terminal truncating variants (after amino
acid residue 1000) or missense variants [6]. PLCE1
pathogenic variants are mostly associated with diffuse
mesangial sclerosis histopathology [6]. Anecdotally,
incomplete penetrance has been reported [40, 41].
NPHS2
NPHS2 (NM_014625.3) biallelic pathogenic variants are
the main genetic cause of CNS beginning >1 month after
birth [10]. There is no correlation regarding age of onset for
truncating versus missense variants [7]. The European
founder mutation c.413G>A (p.Arg138Gln) is frequently
detected in those CNS patients who do not have NPHS1-
related disease [10]. Individuals homozygous for the
c.413G>A (p.Arg138Gln) variant present NS at a median
age of 2 months and generally progress to ESKD after the
age of 5 years (median 79 months; range 24–159 months)
[10]. Individuals with the c.779T>A (p.(Val260Glu)) variant have an earlier age at onset of nephrotic syndrome and
progress more rapidly to ESKD when compared to subjects
with the c.413G>A (p.Arg138Gln) variant [10].
The disease-associated allele c.686G>A (p.Arg229Gln)
has variant dependent pathogenicity [42, 43]. It is considered
pathogenic only when located in trans to another recessive
pathogenic variant in exon 7 or 8 of NPHS2. Such compound
heterozygosity generally causes late onset nephrotic syndrome (after the median age of 17 months) [6, 10, 42, 43].
However, a few subjects developed nephrotic syndrome in
the first month of life; yet, progressed slowly to ESKD [10].

In LAMB2 (NM_002292.3), N-terminal truncating recessive
pathogenic variants tend to manifest before 2 months of life,
whereas C-terminal truncating variants later. Missense variants and small in frame deletions have a higher mean age at
onset of renal disease and lack of neurologic abnormalities
[6]. Diffuse mesangial sclerosis has been identified in 61%
of individuals with LAMB2-associated NS [44].
WT1
WT1 dominant pathogenic variants are associated with a
wide range of clinical phenotypes that are clearly associated
with the type and location of the causative WT1 variant.
More than 90% of the deleterious variants reside in the hot
spot region (exons 8 and 9 and their intronic junctions)
[6, 32, 45, 46].
Classically, individuals with WT1 dominant pathogenic
variants have been subclassified as having Denys–Drash or
Frasier syndrome, however these two syndromes may
overlap phenotypically to a certain extent. A number of
patients present with a milder phenotype that cannot be
easily classified as one of these syndromes [32, 45, 46].
Missense substitutions affecting DNA-binding residues
are associated with diffuse mesangial sclerosis, early-onset
steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome and rapid progression
to ESKD. Truncating variants confer the highest risk of
Wilms tumor (~80%) and congenital anomalies of kidney
and urinary tact (~25%) but are typically associated with
late-onset steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome [32, 45, 46].
Intronic (KTS) variants usually present as isolated SRNS
with the histological picture of FSGS and slow progression
Genetic aspects of congenital nephrotic syndrome: a consensus statement from the ERKNet–ESPN. . . 1373

to ESKD. Patients with isolated SRNS are genotypic and
phenotypic females.
Male-to-female sex reversal (46,XY complete gonadal
dysgenesis) occurs exclusively in individuals with intronic
KTS dominant pathogenic variants and exonic variants.
Urogenital abnormalities have also been described in patients
with all types of WT1 deleterious variants [32, 45, 46].
CoQ10-associated CNS
Primary CoQ10 deficiencies that stem from autosomal
recessive pathogenic variants in genes involving endogenous
CoQ10 biosynthesis can cause nephropathies that are collectively referred to as CoQ10-associated nephropathies. Of
them, COQ2, COQ6, and PDSS2 biallelic variants have been
shown to be related to CNS. As CoQ10 is essential
for mitochondrial electron transport, many organs can be
affected, therefore multisystemic involvement is a cardinal
feature of these disorders. There are no established
genotype–phenotype correlations, potentially due to the small
number of patients in the literature. In addition to progressive
nephropathy, COQ2 pathogenic recessive variants typically
manifest with signs of progressive encephalopathy (including
ataxia, generalized amyotrophy, retinitis pigmentosa, bilateral
sensorineural deafness, hypotonia, and psychomotor delay),
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, as well as diabetes [20, 21].
COQ6 recessive pathogenic variants are associated with
severe infantile onset progressive SRNS resulting in end-stage
renal failure and sensorineural hearing loss, central nervous
system involvement, congenital heart disease, and motor
retardation [13, 47]. PDSS2 recessive pathogenic variants are
associated with Leigh syndrome, a progressive and severe
neurodegenerative disorder, which may become evident
within the first months of life and may result in early death.
Affected individuals usually show global developmental
delay or developmental regression, hypotonia, ataxia, dystonia, and ophthalmologic abnormalities such as nystagmus or
optic atrophy. Basal ganglia and/or brainstem or brain imaging show T2-weighted hyperintensities [22].
It most commonly presents as a progressive and severe
neurodegenerative disorder with onset within the first
months or years of life, and may result in early death.
Affected individuals usually show global developmental
delay or developmental regression, hypotonia, ataxia, dystonia, and ophthalmologic abnormalities, such as nystagmus
or optic atrophy. The neurologic features are associated
with the classic findings of T2-weighted hyperintensities in
the basal ganglia and/or brainstem on brain imaging.
Galloway–Mowat syndrome
GAMOS is a phenotypically heterogeneous disorder characterized by neurodevelopmental defects combined with
podocytopathy. Individuals with GAMOS may not present
overt dysmorphic features, however pre- or postnatal
microcephaly should be considered its hallmark. Central
nervous system abnormalities result in severely delayed
psychomotor development and propensity to seizures.
Additional clinical features include skeletal anomalies and
various degrees of growth retardation [18].
There is high inter- and intrafamilial variability concerning renal involvement with regard to age at onset and
type of kidney disease; some individuals may not even have
renal disease [17, 48].
Recessive pathogenic variants in a number of genes,
including WDR73, LAGE3, OSGEP, TP53RK, and TPRKB
encoding subunits of the KEOPS complex [17, 18, 48];
WDR4 encoding an enzyme required for a specific posttranscriptional modification of tRNA [49]; and NUP107 and
NUP133 encoding nuclear pore complex proteins [50] have
been implicated in the pathogenesis of the disorder. This
significant genetic heterogeneity and extreme rarity of the
disorder with less than 50 patients described so far hamper
precise genotype–phenotype analyses.
SGPL1
Biallelic pathogenic variants in SGPL1 result in a podocytopathy and primary adrenal insufficiency. Additional features include ichthyosis, acanthosis, immunodeficiency
manifesting as lymphopenia, and recurrent bacterial infections. About half had variable neurologic abnormalities
including ataxia, cognitive decline, loss of motor skills,
impaired speech, and sensorineural hearing loss. There was
a significant variability of the extra-adrenal and extrarenal
features in the ~30 individuals reported so far [24, 51, 52].
CRB2
Biallelic pathogenic variants in CRB2 result in a glomerulopathy with additional systemic features in a minority of
cases [53]. The more severe disease manifests already
prenatally with renal corticomedullary cysts and structural
abnormalities of the central nervous system, ventriculomegaly in particular. In some, additional defects of
the radius or postaxial polydactyly is also noted. Most
affected pregnancies have been terminated [23]. No
genotype–phenotype data exist due to the extreme rarity of
the disorder.
Histopathology
Diffuse mesangial sclerosis is associated with dominant
pathogenic variants in WT1 (23.1%) and biallelic pathogenic variants in PLCE1 (17.8%), LAMB2 (13.6%), and
NPHS1 (4.9%) [6]. CoQ10-associated nephropathies may
1374 B. S. Lipska-Ziętkiewicz et al.

be associated with focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis,
focal mesangial sclerosis, and collapsing glomerulopathy
[20, 54]. Increased and dysmorphic mitochondria in podocytes in electron microscopy are highly suggestive for
CoQ10-associated nephropathy. Yet, absence of mitochondrial abnormalities does not exclude CoQ10-associated
nephropathy diagnosis.
8. How to manage syndromic forms?
In addition to standard clinical management of CNS
described in detail elsewhere (Boyer et al. in prep.) we
recommend that all syndromic CNS patients should be
managed by a multidisciplinary team as described below.
NPHS2
We recommend cardiac evaluation in patients with NPHS2
biallelic pathogenic variants as cardiac anomalies have been
shown in 89% of patients with the c.412C>T(p.(Arg138*))
variant [55]. Despite a few case reports describing partial or
complete remission after immunosuppressive treatment, by
principle patients with biallelic NPHS2 pathogenic variants
respond neither to standard steroid treatment nor to intensified immunosuppressive treatment [7, 56, 57]. Therefore,
we recommend not to use immunosuppresive regimens but
to use RAAS blockade in such patients.
WT1
We recommend individuals with WT1-glomerulopathy to be
evaluated for urogenital malformations. Oncological surveillance for Wilms tumor and gonadoblastoma should be
applied. Subjects with exonic variants should be monitored
for Wilms tumor with abdominal US performed every
3 months until the age of 7 years [58]. After reaching
ESKD, bilateral nephrectomy should be considered to prevent the development of Wilms tumor, in particular in
individuals carrying truncating variants [32, 59]. In subjects
with a 46,XY karyotype and a female phenotype (i.e.,
complete gonadal dysgenesis), we recommend bilateral
gonadectomy due to increased gonadoblastoma risk [32].
WT1 patients should be managed by a multidisciplinary
team comprising a clinical geneticist, pediatric oncologist
for Wilms tumor and gonadoblastoma surveillance, pediatric endocrinologist, pediatric surgeon, and psychologist in
cases of disorders of sex development.
LAMB2
We recommend detailed ophthalmological examination in
children with LAMB2 biallelic pathogenic variants, even
though individuals with missense pathogenic variants may
display variable phenotypes ranging from a milder variant
of Pierson syndrome to an isolated CNS. Surviving children
may have neurodevelopmental deficits and blindness [44].
Individuals with LAMB2-associated glomerulopathy
need to be managed by multidisciplinary team composed of
pediatric optalmologist, clinical geneticist, pediatric neurologist and rehabilitation team.
PLCE1
We recommend PLCE1-related nephropathy to be included
in the differential diagnosis in subjects with congenital/
infantile nephrotic syndrome associated with diffuse
mesangial sclerosis in particular. In general, most individuals are resistant to any immunosuppressive therapy but
some selected cases may respond to steroid or cyclosporine
treatment [40, 60].
CoQ10-related mitochondropathies (COQ2, COQ6,
and PDSS2 genes)
We recommend performing complete and repeated screening for extrarenal manifestations in patients with biallelic
pathogenic variants in COQ2, COQ6, and PDSS2 or presenting phenotype suggestive of CoQ10-related glomerulopathy (hearing deficit, encephalopathy, seizures, ataxia,
hypotonia, motor/intelectual disability, elevated lactate
levels, and diabetes).
For diagnosis we recommend massive-parallel sequencing of the corresponding genes in the first place. In case of
a non-informative genetic result, muscle or skin biopsies
may be needed for measuring mitochondrial enzyme
activity [61]. Renal biopsy with electron microscopy allows
quantitative and qualitative analysis of mitochondria [62].
Individuals with CoQ10-related mitochondropathy need
to be managed with a multidisciplinary approach including
a pediatric ophthalmologist, audiologist, clinical geneticist,
pediatric neurologist, rehabilitation team, and in case of
diabetes, pediatric endocrinologist.
We suggest treating the individuals with biallelic
pathogenic variants in COQ2, COQ6, and PDSS2 or presenting phenotype suggestive of CoQ10-related glomerulopathy with oral CoQ10 as early as possible.
Few case reports suggest that patients with defective
variants in CoQ10 biosynthesis genes treated early with oral
CoQ10 have improved outcome [20, 54, 61, 63, 64]. Individuals who respond to treatment exhibit an improvement in
proteinuria and sometimes in neuromuscular complaints,
however, refractory encephalopathy and seizures have been
reported in subjects who had a beneficial effect of CoQ10
treatment on their kidney disease [21]. As the total number
of reported patients is low, the exact dose regimen to
improve or reverse glomerular damage is unknown. The
Genetic aspects of congenital nephrotic syndrome: a consensus statement from the ERKNet–ESPN. . . 1375

initial CoQ10 dose applied in several reported cases is
15–30 mg/kg/day divided in three administrations, which
might be increased to 50 mg/kg/day [47, 54, 63]. Leukocyte
CoQ10 levels can be normal in these patients, and seem not
to be helpful for monitoring therapy [54].
Galloway–Mowat syndrome
We recommend that individuals with GAMOS are managed
by a multidisciplinary team including a pediatric nephrologist, pediatric neurologist, clinical geneticist, and physiotherapist. For older children psychotherapeutic,
psychological and speech therapy services should be
offered. Palliative care may also be considered depending
on the severity of the disease.
SGPL1-associated CNS
We recommend patients with SGPL1-glomerulopathy to be
carefully monitored for adrenal insufficiency. Individuals
should be managed by a multidisciplinary team including a
pediatric nephrologist, pediatric endocrinologist, pediatric
neurologist, clinical geneticist, and physiotherapist. For
older children psychotherapeutic, psychological, and speech
therapy services should be offered. Palliative care may also
be considered depending on the severity of the disease.
9. What is the inheritance pattern of a hereditary CNS?
We recommend that each individual with confirmed
hereditary CNS will have a genetic consult performed to
address the issues of recurrence risk in the family.
The majority of forms of hereditary CNS are inherited in
an autosomal recessive manner. That implies a 25% risk of
recurrence in subsequent pregancies.
The exceptions are:
WT1—inherited in autosomal dominant manner; the
recurrence risk depends whether the genetic defect is
familial or occurred de novo (50% vs. <1% due to
gonadal mosaicism respectively).
LAGE3—inherited in an X-linked recessive manner; the
reccurence risk is 0% for female and 50% for male
siblings.
10. Parents as kidney donors.
We recommend that parents undergo genetic counseling
prior to kidney donation for their child who has CNS with a
confirmed genetic diagnosis.
The majority of forms of hereditary CNS are inherited in
an autosomal recessive (AR) manner (see #9 for
exceptions). This implies that both parents are obligate
carriers of one of the defective variants. An extremely rare
omission to this rule would be a de novo mutation or
misattributed paternity. Carriers of a heterozygous variant in
an AR gene can be kidney donors.
However, it cannot be excluded that the parents actually
are also homozygotes/compound heterozygotes for the
pathogenic variant(s) in the gene associated with a hereditary nephrotic syndrome. NPHS2-related SRNS and WT1-
associated glomerulopathy are the two forms of the disease
with the most significant intra- and inter-family variability,
with age-dependent penetrance reflecting defective variant
type [32, 43]. Moreover, incomplete penetrance has been
described in families with a WT1 pathogenic variant [65].
