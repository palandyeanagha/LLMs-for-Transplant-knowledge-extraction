Instability in the composition of gut bacterial communities (dysbiosis) has been linked to common human 
intestinal disorders, such as Crohn’s disease and colorectal cancer. Here, we show that dysbiosis caused by 
Nod2 deficiency gives rise to a reversible, communicable risk of colitis and colitis-associated carcinogenesis in 
mice. Loss of either Nod2 or RIP2 resulted in a proinflammatory microenvironment that enhanced epithelial 
dysplasia following chemically induced injury. The condition could be improved by treatment with antibiotics 
or an anti–interleukin-6 receptor–neutralizing antibody. Genotype-dependent disease risk was communicable 
via maternally transmitted microbiota in both Nod2-deficient and WT hosts. Furthermore, reciprocal microbiota transplantation reduced disease risk in Nod2-deficient mice and led to long-term changes in intestinal 
microbial communities. Conversely, disease risk was enhanced in WT hosts that were recolonized with dysbiotic fecal microbiota from Nod2-deficient mice. Thus, we demonstrated that licensing of dysbiotic microbiota 
is a critical component of disease risk. Our results demonstrate that NOD2 has an unexpected role in shaping 
a protective assembly of gut bacterial communities and suggest that manipulation of dysbiosis is a potential 
therapeutic approach in the treatment of human intestinal disorders.
Introduction
The gut flora is composed of a huge number of diverse microbial communities, within which Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and 
Proteobacteria are the dominant phyla (1, 2). In humans, the 
coexistence of resident commensals and a single layer of epithelial cells plays a beneficial role in regulating both energy 
harvesting from nutrients and immune system function (3, 4). 
In the absence of commensals, the colonic mucosa displays 
defects in goblet cell differentiation (5) and lymphoid tissue 
architecture (e.g., isolated lymphoid follicles) (6). Importantly, 
not all commensals are able to maintain quiescent, protective 
immunity (7). It has been hypothesized that disturbances of this 
balanced state (referred to herein as dysbiosis) directly or indirectly contribute to the pathogenesis of several immune-mediated intestinal illnesses, such as Crohn’s disease (CD) and colitis-associated colorectal carcinoma (CAC).
CD is characterized by relapsing-remitting inflammatory 
responses that have a tendency to develop where the bacterial load 
is greatest. As such, short-term antibiotic treatment is used as a 
nonspecific therapy in some patients with CD (8). In particular, 
CD is associated with a greater preponderance of certain Bacteroidetes and a lower abundance of Firmicutes (9, 10). More importantly, subclinical dysbiosis has been observed in healthy relatives 
of patients with CD (11). However, it remains to be seen whether 
a defined, dysbiotic state is enough to trigger CD, which in turn 
is a major risk factor for CAC (12). Epithelial dysplasia in this setting is thought to result from impaired intestinal barrier function 
and a proinflammatory milieu, which depends (at least partially) 
on the loss of bidirectional communication between a consortium of microorganisms and host molecules. However, the nature 
and mechanisms of these processes are entirely unknown. A clear 
understanding of the functional role of dysbiosis is thus needed in 
order to establish whether (a) a particular dysbiotic state is sufficient to instigate CD and/or CAC and (b) evaluate the potential for 
preventive manipulation of the gut microbiota in humans.
Although the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain–
containing protein 2 (NOD2) is thought to play a decisive role in 
maintaining microbial tolerance at the intestinal barrier (13–16), 
its role in inducing innate and adaptive immunity is complex 
(17–19). The NOD2 protein is composed of a C-terminal leucine-rich repeat region, a centrally located nucleotide-binding 
oligomerization domain, and a N-terminal tandem of caspase 
recruitment domains that interact with the RIP2 adaptor within 
the cell (20). NOD2 is expressed by various cell populations 
within the colonic mucosa, including epithelial and myeloid cells. 
In mice, genetic ablation of NOD2 enhances the abundance of 
both ileal- and fecal-associated Bacteroidaceae (21–23). Likewise, 
the CD-associated NOD2 variant L1007fsinsC is associated with

enhanced mucosal colonization by the Bacteroidaceae in humans 
(22, 24). However, it remains to be seen whether the dysbiotic 
state caused by this CD-predisposing primary immunodeficiency 
is enough to instigate disease or is merely a consequence of the 
underlying disorder. This study is, to the best of our knowledge, 
the first to describe an unexpected role of NOD2 in the protection 
against intestinal inflammation and tumorigenesis afforded by 
gut bacterial communities in mice.
Results
Nod2/RIP2 deficiency confers a maternally transmissible colitis risk on 
immunocompetent hosts. Given that a stable composition of commensals is (at least in part) an inherited trait, we hypothesized 
that some of the missing heritability in CD could be explained 
by the transmission of a disease-predisposing bacterial community from one generation to another and between offspring. We 
therefore performed cohousing and cross-fostering experiments 
with Nod2- or RIP2-deficient mice and studied their characteristics in an experimentally induced colitis model that consists of 
either acute or chronic exposure to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). 
Briefly, WT mice were cohoused with Nod2- or RIP2-deficient 
mice. Some animals were cohoused with mutant mice throughout 
the experiments (referred to as the CH-WTNod2–/– and CH-WTRIP2–/–
groups), whereas others were separated from the mutants 
(referred to as the SCH-WTNod2–/– and SCH-WTRIP2–/– groups) just 
before disruption of the colonic barrier with DSS (Figure 1A). As 
a control, other WT mice were housed singly (referred to as the 
SH-WT group) prior to administration of DSS.
Unexpectedly, both CH-WT) (Figure 1, B and C) and separated 
cohoused WT (SCH-WT) (Figure 1D) mice showed a greater loss of 
body weight, more severe bloody diarrhea, and a higher histology 
score (Figure 1, E and F) after DSS exposure (relative to SH-WT 
animals). Likewise, mortality and morbidity (including weight 
loss, diarrhea, and rectal bleeding) were significantly enhanced 
during the recovery phase in DSS-treated, single-housed mutant 
mice (referred to as SH-Nod2–/– and SH-RIP2–/–, respectively), when 
compared with similarly treated SH-WT animals (Supplemental 
Figure 1; supplemental material available online with this article; 
doi:10.1172/JCI62236DS1). These results show that the enhanced 
disease risk in CH-WT mice is more likely to result from inheritance of a disease-predisposing microbiota than from the more 
severe DSS-induced colitis observed in mutant mice. On the 
molecular level, secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 was transiently but significantly enhanced during the 
early phase of colitis in SH-Nod2–/– animals, when compared with 
that in SH-WT animals (Supplemental Figure 2A). Furthermore, 
immunohistochemical analysis revealed the robust expression 
of interleukin-6 in dendritic-like cells and a low but detectable 
expression of interleukin-6 in intestinal epithelial cells upon DSS 
challenge (Supplemental Figure 2B). In order to establish which 
infiltrating cells were expressing interleukin-6, we performed double immunofluorescence staining with anti–interleukin-6 and 
anti-CD11b, anti-CD4, or anti-CD8a antibodies. In line with a previous report of significant interleukin-6 production by dendritic 
cells upon DSS challenge (25), none of the aforementioned subsets 
of CD11b+, CD4+, or CD8+ cells was found to express detectable 
interleukin-6 in DSS-treated animals, regardless of the expression 
of RIP2 (Supplemental Figure 3). Since TNF-α is also a key regulator of intestinal inflammation and tumorigenesis in T-bet−/− Rag2−/−
ulcerative colitis (TRUC) mice in response to bacterial commensals 
(26), we next quantified protein levels of TNF-α. In contrast to 
the results in the literature for TRUC mice, we failed to detect any 
RIP2-dependent changes of TNF-α secretion over time (Supplemental Figure 7B, respectively). Likewise, DSS-treated SH-WT and 
SH-Nod2–/– animals had similar colonic levels of Tnfa gene transcripts (Supplemental Figure 2C). In contrast, qRT-PCR analysis 
confirmed a transient but significant elevation of transcript levels 
for not only the gene encoding interleukin-6 (Il6) but also for its 
known target genes, including those encoding matrix metallopeptidase 13 (Mmp13), prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (Ptgs2), 
and secreted phosphoprotein 1 (Spp1, also known as early T lymphocyte activation 1) (Supplemental Figure 2D). Moreover, expression of Reg3b and Reg3g (which are also linked to the interleukin-6–
mediated signaling pathway; refs. 27, 28) was downregulated in 
Nod2–/– mice upon DSS treatment (Supplemental Figure 2D). 
As observed in CH-WTRIP2–/– mice, body weight loss (Figure 2A) 
and colon shortening (Figure 2B) in WT animals reared with a 
RIP2–/– mother since birth (referred to as CF-WTRIP2–/– animals) 
were more severe than those in cross-fostered WT (CF-WT) progeny mice. Accordingly, microscopic examination of H&E- and 
PAS-stained colonic sections revealed greater histopathological 
changes (including colon crypt loss, immune cell influx, and ulceration of the epithelial surface) in CF-WTRIP2–/– mice than in controls (Figure 2C). This result suggested that the vulnerability to 
colitis transmitted from one generation of mutant mice to another 
may be due to inheritance of a dysbiotic bacterial flora that sensitizes the colonic mucosa to chemical insult.
Fecal dysbiosis in Nod2-deficient mice sensitizes the colonic mucosa to 
chemical injury. We next sought to establish whether or not the disease-predisposing microbiota in Nod2-deficient mice directly triggered spontaneous inflammatory response in WT animals prior 
to any injury via DSS. To this end, WT animals were single-housed 
or cohoused for 4 weeks with either Nod2- or RIP2-deficient mice. 
Gene expression analysis was performed on RNA extracted from 
the isolated colons of SH-WT and CH-WTNod2–/– animals that had 
not been treated by DSS (Supplemental Figure 4 and Supplemental Table 1). In contrast to what had been observed during 
DSS-induced colitis, whole-genome expression analysis revealed 
similar levels of transcription of genes involved in the inflammatory response (including Il6, Mmp13, Ptgs2, and Spp1) in SH-WT 
and CH-WTNod2–/– animals. Accordingly, we failed to observe any 
NOD2-dependent differences in either Il6 or Tnfa gene expression 
between germ-free (GF) and specific pathogen–free (SPF) mice 
prior to any injury (Supplemental Figure 5). More importantly, 
a qRT-PCR analysis confirmed the differential gene expression 
of claudin 5 (Cldn5) in CH-WTNod2–/– and CH-WTRIP2–/– animals 
(relative to that of single-housed control animals) prior to DSS 
exposure (Figure 3A). Likewise, levels of Cldn5 transcript were 
found to be upregulated in animals at risk of disease upon DSS 
injury, i.e., the SCH-WTNod2–/– (Figure 3B) and CF-WTRIP2–/– animals (Figure 3C). Furthermore, gene ontology analyses revealed an 
increase in the transcription of genes whose products are involved 
in apoptosis, necrosis, and tumorigenesis (Supplemental Figure 4 
and Supplemental Table 2). Taken as a whole, our results suggest 
that response to components of the microbiota from either Nod2- 
or RIP2-deficient mice did not result in spontaneous colitis. It is 
worth noting that NOD2-mediated dysbiosis impaired coordination of the expression of molecules required for integrity of the 
colonic epithelium that would lead to enhanced intestinal inflammation in response to injury.

A communicable risk of colitis-associated colorectal cancer in the absence 
of Nod2 and RIP2. Colorectal carcinogenesis is a redoubtable complication of CD in humans. It is thought to result from a complex, microbial-driven inflammatory response (29). Furthermore, 
mutations in NOD2 have been shown to predispose to both 
colorectal cancer and gastric lymphoma in humans (30, 31). We 
therefore sought to establish whether or not the communicable 
risk of colitis in Nod2–/– and RIP2–/– mice influenced the development of CAC in CH-WT mice. To this end, single-housed and 
cohoused mice were studied in a well-characterized experimental 
model of CAC (32). Under these conditions, the tumor load in 
the distal gut of both CH-WTNod2–/– and CH-WTRIP2–/– mice was 
greater than that in SH-WT animals (Figure 4, A–C). Similarly, 
a lack of NOD2 or RIP2 was associated with greater CAC-related mortality and morbidity in two independent SPF environments (Figure 4, D and E, and Supplemental Figure 6, A and B). 
Moreover, the greater tumor burden (Figure 4, D and E) and 
growth (Figure 4F) observed in SH-Nod2–/– mice were preceded 
by enhanced epithelial proliferation, as determined by BrdU 
incorporation in vivo (Figure 4G). As observed following DSS 
treatment, interleukin-6 secretion was significantly enhanced 
during the early phase of tumor initiation but not during tumor 
progression in CH-WTRIP2–/– animals (relative to that in SH-WT 
animals) (Supplemental Figure 7). Taken as a whole, these results 
demonstrate that NOD2 or RIP2 deficiency was associated with 
the presence of a maternally transmissible set of microorganisms 
that appeared to sensitize the intestinal mucosa to both colitis 
and CAC — even in a nongenetically predisposed host.
Broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment reduces disease severity, bacterial counts, inflammatory response, and immune cell trafficking in 
Nod2-deficient mice upon injury. The unexpected transmission of 
disease-predisposing microorganisms in mice lacking NOD2 
or RIP2 prompted us to wonder whether antibiotic treatment 
would limit the development of dysplasia in a proinflammatory colonic environment. Following combination therapy with 
broad-spectrum antibiotics, we found that the genotype-driven 
morbidity and mortality were markedly lower than those in 
untreated animals. It is noteworthy that the disease was also 
less severe in antibiotic-treated WT animals (Figure 5A). These 
observations indicate a more general role for bacterial commensals in the pathogenesis of colitis and CAC in the absence of 
NOD2 or RIP2. In Nod2-deficient animals, the changes in gut 
microbiota after antibiotic treatment were associated with a significantly lower body weight loss (Figure 5A), a lower Bacteroides
count (Figure 5B), and decreased recruitment of CD11b+Ly6G+
granulocytic cells within the colonic mucosa (Figure 5C) compared with that in untreated animals. In contrast, we failed to 
observe any changes in the influx of either CD11b–CD11c+ or 
CD11b+CD11c+IA/IEhi macrophages (Figure 5, D and E). To 
further characterize the disease remission induced by antibiotic 
treatment in both WT and Nod2-deficient mice, we next isolated RNA from the colon after 1 cycle of DSS-azoxymethane 
(DSS-AOM) exposure. A genome-wide expression analysis and a 
gene ontology analysis revealed that antibiotic treatment influFigure 2

enced the expression of 56 genes primarily involved in infiltration of neutrophils and cell movement of granulocytes and myeloid cells (Supplemental Figure 8). In line with previous findings 
in DSS-treated animals, qRT-PCR analysis confirmed that 
the enhanced transcription of Il6, Ptgs2, and Spp1 in diseased 
Nod2-deficient mice returned to normal levels after antibiotic 
treatment, when compared with similarly treated WT animals 
(Supplemental Tables 3 and 4 and Supplemental Figure 9). Last, 
tumor growth (as determined by the weight-to-length ratio) was 
significantly less rapid in antibiotic-treated mice — regardless 
of the genotype (Figure 5F). Overall, our results suggest that 
certain bacterial commensals instigate (either individually or 
together) an exaggerated inflammatory response that favors 
intestinal tumorigenesis upon injury.
Enhanced interleukin-6 secretion is required for tumor growth in Nod2- 
and RIP2-deficient mice. In line with previous reports (33, 34), we 
next sought to determine whether or not an enhanced, early

tinal tumorigenesis. A week before the last cycle of DSS-AOM, 
Nod2–/– mice were given a weekly, i.p. injection of a monoclonal 
anti–interleukin-6 receptor antibody that reportedly suppresses 
Th1 cell-mediated colitis in mice (35). Endoscopic (Figure 6A) 
and macroscopic (Figure 6B) evaluations revealed that anti–interleukin-6 receptor treatment resulted in a significant decrease in 
tumor burden, when compared with untreated mutant animals 
and regardless of the genotype. Accordingly, interleukin-6 receptor neutralization in Nod2–/– mice resulted in the normalization 
of transcript levels for the following antibiotic-sensitive genes: Il6, 
Ptgs2, Spp1, Reg3g, and Reg3b (Figure 6C). This agrees with previous reports in which genetic ablation of Il6 reduced tumor load 
and growth (28) and interleukin-6 hyperactivation promoted 
tumor progression (33, 34).
The interleukin-6–mediated control of disease progression is linked to 
changes in microbial ecology. We next looked at whether disease progression was linked to specific, NOD2-dependent changes in the 
relationship between bacterial communities and interleukin-6–
mediated signaling pathways. A culture-independent analysis of 
the mucosal-associated microbiota was performed by multiplex 
pyrosequencing of V1–V2 region amplicons of bacterial 16S rRNA 
genes. The respective impacts of host genotype, treatment, and 
intestinal tumorigenesis on the composition and structure of the 
microbial communities were assessed in a multivariate principal 
coordinate analysis (PCoA) and a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). The PCoA plots of the UniFrac distances revealed a 
clear separation between genotypes in untreated animals but not 
after anti–interleukin-6 receptor treatment (Figure 7A). A CCA 
was used to detect interactions between bacterial composition 
(at the genus level) on one hand and factors such as intestinal 
tumorigenesis, genotype, and anti–interleukin-6 receptor treatment on the other. The analysis identified NOD2 genotype and 
anti–interleukin-6 receptor treatment as major contributors to 
the observed changes in the composition of mucosal-associated 
bacterial communities (Figure 7B). Notably, we observed changes 
in the abundance of commensals related to the Bacteroidetes phyla 
(Figure 7C) that (according to a similarity percentage [SIMPER] 
analysis) included Rikenella and Paludibacter (Figure 7D). Notably, anti–interleukin-6 receptor treatment of mice lacking NOD2 
was associated with a greater abundance of Rikenella (P < 0.02), 
suggesting that protective assembly of the microbiota may result 
from a specific gene-plus-treatment interaction. In contrast, CCA 
revealed that dysbiosis only made a minor contribution to tumor 
growth (Figure 7B). Hierarchical clustering of species-level operational taxonomic units (OTUs) was performed using ranked, 
normalized data (Supplemental Figure 10). Following anti–interleukin-6 receptor treatment, the consortium of mucosal-associated bacteria was more diverse in both tumoral and chronically 
inflamed colonic mucosae (Figure 7, E and F). Collectively, these 
results suggest that neutralization of the interleukin-6–mediated 
signaling pathway restores complex, NOD2-dependent control of 
the colonic-associated microbiota in mice.

The colitis risk in Nod2-deficient mice is mitigated by fecal transplantation. 
Given that the risk of colitis in Nod2–/– mice was communicable to 
Nod2-sufficient animals (Figure 1), we sought to formally determine 
whether the combination of fecal dysbiosis and NOD2 deficiency 
intrinsically conferred a risk of disease — even in the absence of any 
signs of inflammation. After 4 weeks of colonization with a 0.2 ml 
supernatant of fresh fecal homogenate from either nondiseased 
Nod2–/– or Nod2+/+ mice that were reared under SPF conditions, 
recolonized GF WT (GF-Nod2+/+) mice were challenged with a single DSS-AOM cycle. Under these conditions, the weight loss and 
histopathology scores of Nod2+/+ mice recolonized with fecal flora 
from Nod2–/– mice (referred to as Nod2–/–→GF-Nod2+/+ mice) were 
significantly greater than those recorded in GF-Nod2+/+ mice recolonized with fecal flora from Nod2+/+ mice (referred to as Nod2+/+→GFNod2+/+ mice) (Figure 8A). Another characteristic lesion of DSS-induced colitis is the loss of mucin-producing epithelial cells, which are 
usually revealed with PAS+ staining. Only recipients colonized with 
fecal microbiota from Nod2–/– mice lacked PAS+ staining (Figure 8, 
B and E); this finding suggests that the fecal microbiota of Nod2–/–
mice intrinsically contribute to the disease risk. We next sought to 
restore the ecological balance in the intestinal microbiome in Nod2–/–
mice and establish whether or not this would decrease the host’s vulnerability to colonic injury. GF-Nod2–/– mice were generated and then 
colonized with 0.2 ml of the supernatant of a fresh fecal homogenate 
from either SPF Nod2–/– or SPF Nod2+/+ mice. As shown in Figure 8, 
D–F, body weight loss, tissue erosion, and immune cell influx 
were lower in Nod2+/+→GF-Nod2–/– mice than in similarly treated 
Nod2–/–→GF-Nod2–/– animals. PCoA plots highlighted the differences in microbial composition and structure between recipients 
with a higher risk of colitis (Nod2–/–→GF-Nod2–/– and Nod2–/–→GFNod2+/+ animals) and those with a lower risk of colitis (Figure 8G). 
It is noteworthy that both fecal- and mucosal-associated phylodiversity in both Nod2–/–→GF-Nod2–/– and Nod2–/–→GF-Nod2+/+ mice 
was markedly lower than that in Nod2+/+→GF-Nod2–/– mice (P < 0.01; 
Supplemental Figure 11A and Supplemental Figure 12A). Furthermore, a SIMPER analysis revealed that Bacteroides, Escherichia/Shigella, 
Robinsoniella, Paludibacter, Butyrivibrio, and Lachnobacterium were the 
genera that contributed to at least 5% of the shifts in bacterial communities, when comparing colitis-vulnerable and colitis-resistant 
recipients. Furthermore, Nod2–/–→GF-Nod2–/– and Nod2–/–→GFFigure 6

Nod2+/+ animals differed in terms of the abundance of Escherichia/
Shigella, Robinsoniella, and Paludibacter — even though both group of 
animals were colitis vulnerable. This observation suggests that the 
latter changes in abundance were not correlated with the disease risk 
(Supplemental Figures 11 and 12). In contrast, the preponderance 
of Bacteroides was significantly greater in both WT (P < 0.01) and 
Nod2–/– (P < 0.05) recipients recolonized with disease-predisposing 
microbiota, when compared with recipients recolonized with SPF 
WT microflora. Furthermore, Butyrivibrio and Lachnobacterium were 
significantly less preponderant in both WT recipients (P < 0.001 
and P < 0.02, respectively) and Nod2–/– recipients (P = 0.01 and 
P < 0.02, respectively) upon recolonization with fecal microbiota of 
Nod2–/– donor, when compared with Nod2+/+→GF-Nod2+/+ animals. 
In summary, our results demonstrate that the disease-predisposing flora in Nod2–/– mice intrinsically sensitize the colonic mucosa 
to chemical insult prior to the onset of any disease — even in WT 
mice. Importantly, reciprocal transplantation of microbiota rescued 
Nod2–/– mice from the disease risk.
Discussion
Given the intestinal epithelium’s intimate relationship with the 
microbiome throughout the host’s entire life, this structure is 
likely to coordinate immune homeostasis by fostering the stability and resilience of its coevolved microbiota. In the mouse, the 
absence of (a) Rag2 and T-bet, (b) the angiotensin-converting 
enzyme 2 (ACE2), or (c) the Nod-like receptor pyrin domaincontaining protein 6 is known to predispose to the emergence 
of transmissible, disease-predisposing commensals (26, 36, 37). 
Understanding how the gut mucosa discriminates between disease-predisposing microorganisms and mutualists may provide 
insights into disease onset and tumor progression in genetically 
predisposed individuals and their relatives. Herein, we identified 
a hitherto unexpected protective function of the CD-predisposing 
Nod2 gene: the orchestration of concerted, protective gut microbial 
communities against intestinal inflammation and tumorigenesis 
in mice. In fact, WT mice that were transiently cohoused with 
Nod2–/– or RIP2–/– mice showed a heightened susceptibility to colFigure 7

differences in the inflammatory state, it is important to bear in 
mind that GF animals recolonized with feces from nondiseased 
Nod2–/– mice showed enhanced vulnerability to DSS (regardless 
of the recipient’s NOD2 status). These observations suggested 
complex imprinting on the colonic mucosa via a transmissible 
dysbiosis that promotes disruption of the epithelial barrier function. Broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment abrogated the elevated 
sensitivity of both WT and Nod2-deficient mice to DSS-induced 
intestinal inflammation and tumorigenesis. Accordingly, a recent 
study highlighted a significant role for CD-associated NOD2
L1007fsinsC in the development of gut microbiota (22, 24). We 
next used a culture-independent approach to characterize changes 
itis and CAC. This demonstrated that the changes in ecological 
niches created by NOD2 deficiency conferred a transmissible disease risk on mice — even WT animals. More importantly, abnormal 
expression of molecules involved in the epithelial barrier function 
was observed in WT animals upon cohousing, both during intestinal inflammation and prior to the experimental induction of colitis. This finding suggests that the microbiota of Nod2-deficient 
mice indeed sensitizes the colonic mucosa to injury. It is noteworthy that enhanced expression of claudin 5 (which is known 
to be involved in the pathogenesis of CD; ref. 38) was observed 
in cohoused animals before and after injury. Although it could 
be argued that the observed changes were due (at least in part) to

Methods
Colitis and colitis-associated cancer. Age- and gender-matched animals were 
housed 5 or 10 per cage for single-housing and cohousing experiments, 
respectively. In a half-day light cycle exposure and temperature-controlled 
SPF environment, as determined by the FELASA recommendations, animals had free access to a standard laboratory chow diet. Experimental 
models were performed as previously described (51). A cocktail combining streptomycin (Panpharma; 2 g/l), gentamicin (Panpharma; 200 mg/l), 
ciprofloxacin (Panpharma; 125 μg/l), and bacitracin (Acros Organics; 
1 g/l) was used. Neutralization was performed by i.p. injecting 1 mg MR16.1 
(Chugai Pharmaceuticals Co Ltd.) per mouse. Mouse endoscopy was performed using the Coloview high-resolution system (Karl-Storz).
Recolonization. Nod2–/– GF mice were generated at TAAM-CNRS and 
were transferred into autoclaved sterile microisolator cages before gavage 
with 200 μl of fecal homogenates as indicated above (5 mice per cage). The 
remaining homogenate was kept frozen until processing for bacterial composition analysis.
Gene expression. Microarrays analysis was performed on distal colonic 
specimens as previously described (Agilent Technologies) (51). Differentially expressed genes (GEO accession numbers GSE32421 and GSE 36481) 
were filtered for a P value of less than 0.01 by using moderated t statistic 
with empirical Bayes shrinkage of SEM. Statistics were corrected for multiple testing using a false discovery rate approach. Gene ontology analysis 
was performed on all genes referenced in the UniGene database (52) by 
using the third hierarchical level of the ontology tree (Ingenuity Pathway 
Analysis). qRT-PCR analysis was performed as previously described (51).
Histopathological, immunohistochemistry, and FACS analysis. Paraffin-embedded 5-μm sections of formalin-fixed colon specimens were stained with 
H&E or PAS. The slides were blindly examined by two investigators with an 
AxioPlan2 microscope (Zeiss). Colonic lamina propria cells were isolated as 
previously described (53) and analyzed on a BD Calibur II cytometer. The 
following primary antibodies were used: anti-Ly6G PE-Cy7 (clone 1A8), 
anti-CD11b PerCP Cy5.5 (clone M1/70), anti-CD11c APC (clone HL3), 
anti-IA/IE FITC (clone 2G9), and Fc block (anti-CD32/CD16) (BD Pharmingen and R&D Systems).
For immunofluorescence staining, colonic segments were embedded in 
Cryomatrix (Shandon, Thermo Scientific) and frozen on dry ice. Cryosections (10 μm) were fixed for 5 minutes in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, 
washed in PBS-0.05% Tween20 (PBT), and incubated for 30 minutes at 
room temperature in PBT-5% normal goat serum (saturation buffer) and 
then overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies diluted in saturation buffer. Sections were washed in PBT and incubated for 1 hour with secondary antibodies. Nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Slides were mounted in Aqua Poly/Mount (PolySciences). The 
following antibodies were used: anti–interleukin-6 (M-19, sc-1265, Santa 
Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) and anti-CD4 (GK1.5), anti-CD8a (53-6.7), and 
biotin-conjugated anti-CD11b (M1/70) (all from BD Pharmingen). The 
secondary antibodies used were as follows: Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated 
anti-rabbit IgG, Alexa Fluor 594–conjugated anti-rat (Molecular Probes), 
and Cy3-conjugated streptavidin (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories).
For immunohistochemistry, 5-μm sections were deparaffinized and 
processed for antigen retrieval using 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6), 
washed with PBS, incubated for 5 minutes in PBS-3% H2O2, washed 
in PBT, and incubated for 30 minutes in saturation buffer and then 
overnight at 4°C with polyclonal anti–interleukin-6 antibody (M-19, 
sc-1265, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.). Detection was performed with 
biotinylated secondary antibody and then avidin biotinylated peroxidase 
complex for 1 hour and revealed with 3, 3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) 
(Vectastain Elite ABC kit and DAB, Vector Laboratories). Sections were 
counterstained with hematoxylin.
in the composition of the microbial consortia. The risk of communicating disease to WT animals was primarily linked to changes in 
Bacteroides, Butyrivibrio, and Lachnobacterium communities — all of 
which may be important in the pathogenesis of human diseases 
(39). Notably, some of the aforementioned genera are involved 
in metabolism of indigestible dietary polysaccharides (40). Furthermore, commensal Bacteroides species (but not colitis-enriched 
Enterobacteriaceae) have been identified as a key determinant of 
disease risk in conventionally raised, genetically predisposed hosts 
(41). Our findings therefore illustrate the need to functionally 
assess disease-predisposing capacity not only in a single commensal but also in combinations of commensals that may fail to negatively regulate inflammation and/or to outcompete pathobionts — 
even in a nongenetically predisposed host. Furthermore, determining the metabolic properties of disease-predisposing sets of 
commensals may provide insights into how NOD2 prevents their 
expansion and/or adhesion. This paradigm will help select the 
most efficient combination of probiotic strains, independently of 
the CD-predisposing Nod2 alleles.
In this study, disease severity was linked to disruption of the 
epithelial barrier function in response to a dysbiotic microbiota that accelerated the progression of tumors in the absence of 
NOD2. These results further support the hypothesis whereby early 
changes in the gut microbiota may imprint otherwise protective 
immunological responses that, later in life, can trigger colorectal 
cancer in the context of a primary immunodeficiency (42, 43). 
These findings may be of clinical relevance, since loss-of-function 
mutations of NOD2 are associated with an enhanced risk of CD 
(13, 15) and colorectal cancer in humans (44–46). The colonic 
mucosa of patients with CD is characterized by increased secretion of interleukin-6, the magnitude of which is a predictor of the 
endoscopic recurrence and is correlated with the disease severity 
(47, 48). Interleukin-6 regulates the differentiation and survival 
of epithelial cells by triggering activation of the associated Janus 
kinases and the STAT3 (33, 34). Upon injury, interleukin-6 is primarily secreted by dendritic cells, which continuously inspect the 
luminal contents (25, 34). In line with previous findings (34), we 
detected the expression of interleukin-6 by dendritic-like cells 
and also colonocytes upon DSS challenge. Interleukin-6 may 
well bind to its membrane receptor, which is restricted to a few 
cell populations (such as macrophages). Alternatively, after shedding of the interleukin-6 receptor as a soluble form, interleukin-6 
may trans-signal to virtually all cell types by binding to a soluble 
cytokine-receptor complex (49), because the coreceptor gp130 is 
expressed ubiquitously (50). Recent studies have also highlighted 
the key impact of interleukin-6 on tumor progression within 
chronically inflamed lesions. Importantly, Il6- or Stat3-knockout 
mice exhibited a lower tumor load and slower tumor growth in 
a model of CAC (28), whereas hyperactivation of these 2 genes 
promotes tumor growth (33, 34). It is noteworthy that the NOD2 
genotype and anti–interleukin-6 receptor therapy were found to 
strongly influence complex changes in the overall structure of the 
disease-predisposing mucosal- and fecal-associated flora. Future 
clinical and metagenomics studies should investigate the contribution of the complete set of genetic variants in known CD and 
CAC risk genes to the overall control of potentially dysbiotic 
microbial communities. This type of knowledge should facilitate 
the development of modulating therapies that seek to restore 
mutualistic interactions between the microbiota and the vulnerable intestinal barrier in patients with CD.

q-PCR and pyrosequencing analysis. Colonic and fecal samples were collected and stored frozen before DNA extraction for q-PCR analysis by using 
the Qiamp DNA Stool Kit (Qiagen) and Nucleospin Tissue Kit (Macherey-Nagel), respectively. Absolute numbers of Bacteroides were determined 
by q-PCR analysis on a Stratagene Mx3005P (Agilent Technologies) from 
serial dilutions of plasmid constructs with a reference 16S rDNA sequence. 
Pyrosequencing of extracted DNA was performed as previously described 
(22). A total of 1,000 high-quality reads was generated from each of the 
biological replicates. The specific forward and reverse primers sequences 
are available at Supplemental Table 5. 16S rRNA gene sequences with at 
least 97% similarity were clustered into species level OTUs using average 
neighbor algorithm. Phylogenetic affiliation of each OTU was governed by 
using RDP taxonomy and template file. PCoA and CCA were performed to 
visualize interactions among the microbial composition and structure, the 
host genotype, the anti–interleukin-6 receptor treatment, and the presence 
of tumor. Phylogenetic-based (fast UniFrac) beta diversity was on phylogenetic tree generated by using FastTree version 2.0. Nonabundance-based 
UniFrac matrices were calculated and visualized using PCoA. PAST software was used for data visualization and for performing abundance-based 
PCoA, CCA, and SIMPER analysis on the bacterial genera observed in 
pyrosequencing data. Divergence-based phylogenetic diversity was calculated by phylo.diversity command implemented in mothur.
Cluster generation. OTUs were selected to contribute to the separation 
between WT and Nod2-deficient animals using the Mann-Whitney U test, 
with subsequent selection of the 20 best P values. In parallel, OTUs that 
were present in less than 50% of all samples were excluded from the cluster analysis. Prior to clustering, OTU abundances were normalized using 
z-score normalization to make OTUs comparable. Clustering was performed with TIBCO Spotfire (Integromics Biomarker Discovery), applying 
the unweighted pair group method using arithmetic means of the pairwise 
distances as a clustering method and correlation as a distance measure.
Statistics. The nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis or the parametric 1-way 
ANOVA test with multiple Dunn’s comparison was used (GraphPad Software). Values are expressed as mean ± SEM. Statistical significance was 
defined at a level of P < 0.05.
