Except for legends and claims of miracles, most histories of transplantation cover only the last
60 years because there were no earlier successes. However, the story of even this era has been
documented in such rich detail that a full account would fill several volumes. Thus, this brief
summary must be limited to highly selected “landmarks.” Some landmarks had an immediate impact, but the importance of others went unrecognized for decades. Some findings that
deserved landmark status were overlooked or forgotten, whereas others of no biological
significance had major impact. Placing these events in perspective is challenging. Several
of transplantation’s pioneers are still alive, and most of the others are within living memory.
Virtually all of them have produced their own accounts. For the most part, they agree on
what the “landmarks” are, but their differences in emphasis and perspective make an interesting story.
PRE-HISTORY: THE ERA OF MYTHS
AND MIRACLES
The idea of replacing diseased or damaged
body parts has been around for millennia.
Envisioned were complex transplants such as
the “successful” transplantation of an entire leg
by the 3rd century sainted physicians Cosmos
and Damien, which is depicted in several famous paintings (Zimmerman 1998). As early
as 600 B.C., the use of autogenous skin flaps to
replace missing noses was conceived, and by the
sixteenth century, Gaspare Tagliacozzi (Tagliacozzi 1597) and other pioneering plastic surgeons were successful with such procedures.
The obvious extension of these methods was to
use detached or “free” grafts of the patient’s own
tissue or that of other donors. But not until the
twentieth century was it ever mentioned that
grafts might fail. Even the great eighteenth century experimentalist John Hunter, who transplanted human teeth and autotransplanted
cocks’ spurs into their combs, seemed unaware
that homografts would fail (Martin 1970). Only
in the last half of the 20th century has there been
a consensus that the outcome of homografts differs from that of autografts.
For a long time, proponents of skin homografts refused to admit that they would not work.
Success was even claimed for grafts of whole ears
and noses. After centuries of sloppy observation
and self-deception, the realization crept in that
detached (free) skin grafts were useless. In retrospect, the technical failure of even the early
autografts was not surprising because at first

full-thickness skin grafts were used. These thick
grafts never became established because their
underlying layer of fat and other tissue prevented revascularization. The first major technical
advance (almost a “landmark”) came only in
1869, when Jacques-Louis Reverdin discovered
that small, thin (split thickness) grafts would
heal (Reverdin 1869). His autogenous “pinch
grafts” successfully covered burns, ulcers, or
open wounds. Others caught on, and soon an
extensive experience with both autografts and
homografts was accumulated. Surprisingly, neither Reverdin nor other enthusiasts (including
well-respected surgeons such as Joseph Lister)
noticed that homografts were inferior to autografts (Goldman 1987). Only one report of the
time suggested otherwise. In 1871, the British
surgeon George Pollock described a set of successful autogenous grafts, while on the same patient’s wound, homografts both from himself
and another donor soon “disappeared” (Pollock
1871). This report was ignored while for additional decades claims of successful homografts
continued. In one such case during the Boer
War, Winston Churchill donated skin to help
heal the open wound of a fellow officer. Years
later, Churchill (1944) reported that this graft
was still successful.
TRANSPLANTATION RESEARCH OF
A LOST ERA
Although consensus on the fate of homografts
would not be reached for another 50 years, during the first decades of the twentieth century
several well-known investigators established
not only the inevitability of homograft failure
but most of the other basic principles of transplantation immunology. In 1903, Paul Ehrlich
studied transplantation of tumors in mice without bothering to determine the response to
transplants of normal tissue (Medawar 1958).
The use of tumor homografts confused the issue
because they would sometimes overwhelm their
recipients before being rejected. In the sameyear,
the Danish biologist Carl Jensen (1903) perceived that the failure of tumor homografts
was an immune reaction, but this explanation
was discounted by Ehrlich because no antibody
(the accepted hallmark of immunity) could be
detected.
Georg Scho¨ne may deserve recognition as
the first transplantation immunologist. Working in Ehrlich’s laboratory in 1912, he studied
grafts of skin rather than tumors. He determined
that homografts always failed and that subsequent grafts from the same donor failed more
rapidly than the first (Scho¨ne 1912). Three decades later, several surgeons would be squabbling for the credit of discovering this “second
set” response, suggesting that they deserved a
share of Medawar’s Nobel Prize, which in part
was based on this landmark observation.
By the end of the 1920s, scientists at the
Rockefeller Institute firmly established other
tenets of transplantation immunology including the central role of the lymphocyte. James
B. Murphy’s work was especially prescient
(Murphy 1914a; Silverstein 2001). He showed
that resistance to tumor homografts was dependent on the lymphoid system. He sought to extend graft survival by getting rid of lymphocytes
with irradiation, splenectomy, or benzol, the
first chemical immunosuppressive agent, noting
that these methods decreased the lymphocytic
infiltration he observed in failing homografts
(Murphy 1914b). Murphy was convinced that
these cells were responsible for homograft destruction. He could not explain how, because
of the firmly prevailing notion of the time that
lymphocytes were fixed cells that lacked mobility. All of these findings were published in widely
read scientific journals, but they were ignored by
most and eventually were largely forgotten. David Hamilton in his excellent recent history dubs
this the “lost era” of transplantation (Hamilton
2012, pp. 105–125).
PIONEERS OF ORGAN GRAFTING
Half a century before proponents of skin homografts finally conceded their futility, surgeons
using the more complex model of kidney transplantation recognized that homograft failure
was inevitable. Alexis Carrel is commonly credited with originating both vascular suturing and
its use in organ transplantation (Fig. 1). Although the award of the 1912 Nobel Prize for

his development of these techniques was well
deserved, he was actually not the first in either
endeavor. Mathieu Jaboulay, the Chief of Surgery in Lyon, where Carrel trained, and the German surgeon Julius Do¨rfler introduced the
full-thickness blood vessel suturing technique
(Do¨rfler 1895; Jaboulay and Brain 1896). Carrel
only adopted this method a decade later on the
advice of Charles Guthrie after he initially advocated partial thickness suturing.
Technically successful kidney transplants
were accomplished first not by Carrel but by
Emerich Ullmann, who in 1902 performed a
dog autotransplant and a dog-to-goat xenograft
(Ullmann 1914). In 1906, the first two renal
transplants in humans were performed by Jaboulay using a pig donor for one and a goat
donor for the other (Jaboulay 1906). Ernst Unger, after first performing more than 100 kidney
transplants in animals, performed the third and
fourth human transplants in 1909 using monkey
donors (Unger 1910). None of these early human kidney xenografts functioned for more
than a few days, and all of the patients soon died.
In 1904, Carrel left France after failing in
several examinations to qualify for a faculty position there. After a brief sojourn in Montreal, he
moved to Chicago, where he partnered with the
physiologist Charles Guthrie. They collaborated
for barely 12 months, but during this time, they
successfully transplanted the kidney, thyroid,
ovary, heart, lung, and small bowel, averaging a
publication on this work every 14 days (Malanin
1979). Carrel’s success with organ grafts was not
dependent on a new method of suturing but on
his use of fine needles and suture material, his
exceptional technical skill, and his obsession
with strict asepsis.
Carrel’s relationship with Guthrie soon
cooled because Guthrie objected to Carrel’s seven single-author papers about their joint work
and to Carrel’s habit of advancing his fame by
reports in the newspapers. After Carrel left Chicago in 1906 for the Rockefeller Institute in
New York, Guthrie published in Science a criticism of Carrel and the contention that he, rather
than Carrel, deserved most of the credit for their
joint accomplishments. He wrote: “It is a singular fact that up until the time Carrel and I engaged in the work together, his experiments did
not yield good results, and that our results almost from the beginning of our work together
were excellent!” (Guthrie 1909). This was only
one of several instances in which the Nobel Prize
Committee saw it differently than some of the
candidates, and Guthrie was not given a share of
the Nobel Prize.
Carrel’s extensive experience with organ
transplants in animals left no doubt that, although autografts could be consistently successful, homografts never were. In view of the stubborn ongoing claims of successful skin homografts, this was one of Carrel’s most important
findings, in itself a landmark. Carrel did not
know why homografts failed, but he began to
explore methods to avoid this such as matching
of donor and recipient. Under the influence of
his colleague James B. Murphy, he irradiated recipients in unpublished and now forgotten experiments, finding that this improved results
(Flexner 1914).
World War I interrupted the productive
transplantation research at the Rockefeller Institute by Carrel, Murphy, and their colleagues.
Carrel, after spending the war in France treating
wounded soldiers, returned to the Rockefeller

Institute but not to research in transplantation.
Instead, he formed an unlikely partnership with
the aviator Charles Lindbergh, who approached
him to discuss the possibility of a heart operation on a relative. Carrel responded that open
heart surgery would require a pump oxygenator. Lindbergh offered to build such a device,
and Carrel provided laboratory space for the
project (Lindbergh 1978). Lindbergh’s pump
was not used for heart surgery but for perfusion
of organs and tissues. It allowed preservation of
organs for as long as 3 weeks (Anonymous
1931). The publicity-seeking Carrel made sure
that the pump was prominently exhibited at the
1939 New York World’s Fair.
Carrel was the originator of tissue culture,
another technique that subsequently played an
important role in transplantation. He incubated
small fragments of embryonic chicken heart in
dilute plasma. Carrel claimed that by 1919, this
“immortal” tissue had been cultured for 1939
passages and was still normal and pulsating. But
it was subsequently determined that embryonic
cells with a normal diploid set of chromosomes
cannot be maintained in culture for more than
50 doublings unless they undergo malignant
transformation. Carrel’s laboratory technician
eventually admitted the fraud, saying that because Dr. Carrel would be upset if the strain was
lost, she added new embryo cells when they were
needed (Witkowski 1980).
Despite the continued claims of success for
skin homografts, the well-documented failure
of experimental organ homografts by Carrel
discouraged further research in this field, which
during the 1920s and 1930s was continued by
only a few. Frank Mann at the Mayo Clinic conducted extensive studies of canine renal and
heart homografts but failed to extend Carrel’s
earlier findings or explore Carrel’s suggestions
for preventing rejection (Mann 1932).
LEO LOEB, A FORGOTTEN HERO
In the 1930s, Leo Loeb, an e´migre´ from Nazi
Germany working at Washington University in
St. Louis, was one of only a few transplantation
researchers. He determined that the strength
and timing of rejection of skin homografts in
rats was governed by the extent of genetic disparity of donor and recipient. He also showed
that the lymphocyte was involved (Loeb 1945).
As Chief of Pathology, he influenced his plastic
surgeon colleagues James B. Brown and Earl
Padgett in studies determining that identical
twins would accept exchanged skin grafts
(Brown 1937). Loeb reported his finding that
grafts exchanged between (inadequately) inbred
mice of the same strain would fail, mistakenly
claiming that this was due to some mystical
“finer mechanism.” For this error (later retracted after further inbreeding of his mice), he was
viciously ridiculed by his famous faculty colleague, the geneticist C.C. Little, and by others
including Peter Medawar, whose unfair antipathy for Loeb influenced him to dismiss the
importance of the lymphocyte and for years
espouse the humoral theory of rejection (Hamilton 2012, p. 160). This dispute forever tarnished the reputation of Leo Loeb, a forgotten
hero of transplantation research.
UNMODIFIED ANIMAL AND
HUMAN KIDNEY TRANSPLANTS
In 1933, the Soviet surgeon Yu Yu Voronoy performed the first human-to-human kidney transplant. That the kidney was not procured until
6 hours after the donor’s death and that it was
transplanted across a major blood group mismatch probably accounted for its prompt failure
(Voronoy 1937). Four other human homografts
that Voronoy performed between 1933 and 1949
also failed rapidly. Published in Russian, this
experience remained unknown in the West until
the 1950s.
In the 1940s and early 1950s, experimental
dog kidney transplantation was actively conducted by surgeons in Paris and Boston and
also by Morton Simonsen in Denmark and William Dempster in London. The “second set”
phenomenon was again observed, but no new
insights emerged. Simonsen searched in vain
for an antibody response, being unaware of
Loeb’s work on the lymphocyte (Simonsen
1953). Dempster, who joined Medawar in denouncing Loeb and his cellular theory of immunity, may have been the first to use radiation in

organ transplant recipients (Dempster 1953a).
He also treated dog homograft recipients with
cortisone (Dempster 1953b), which Rupert Billingham had found to prolong survival of skin
homografts in rodents (Billingham and Krohn
1951). In dogs, neither treatment had much effect on rejection. Dempster like others despaired
of further progress in organ transplants and advised against any attempt in humans.
The faint hope that homografts might fare
better in humans than animals was spectacularly
rekindled in 1950 when Chicago urologist Richard Lawler performed a human kidney transplant (Lawler et al. 1950). In this patient whose
renal function was impaired but not terminal,
the homograft was claimed to be successful. It
may have produced urine briefly, but when it was
removed after several months, it was found to be
shrunken. This procedure was of no scientific
significance and of no benefit to the patient,
who survived for several years with declining
renal function of her own kidney. Within the
medical profession, this “maverick attempt”
was widely criticized, and Lawler’s urology
colleagues treated him with distain. However,
because enthusiastic reports in the lay media
generated public support, the impact of this
transplant was substantially positive. The French
surgeon Rene´ Ku¨ss said that it provided him the
excuse to start a program in human kidney transplantation (Ku¨ss 1991).
Because no method was available to prevent
rejection, it was recognized that the chances of
success were remote, but the lack of dialysis or
any other treatment for renal failure was used
to justify trials of transplantation in otherwise
doomed patients. In 1951, two teams working
separately in Paris performed nine kidney transplants (Ku¨ss and Bomget 1992). Most of the
donors were guillotined criminals. The kidneys
were placed retroperitoneally in the pelvis revascularized by iliac vessels with the ureter anastamosed to the bladder, a method devised by
Ku¨ss that is still the standard operation. None
of these transplants showed meaningful function, and all of the patients died within days
or weeks (Ku¨ss et al. 1951). The ninth transplant
in this series was the first to use a living relative
as the donor, the patient’s mother. Unlike the
others, this kidney promptly functioned, but it
was rejected after 3 weeks.
In the concurrent Boston program at the
Peter Bent Brigham Hospital, David Hume performed nine kidney transplants between 1951
and 1953 (Hume et al. 1955). The donors were
patients who had died during surgery or hydrocephalus patients who had a normal kidney removed so that its ureter could be used as a conduit to drain their excess cerebrospinal fluid to
the bladder. Except for one orthotopic transplant, they were placed in the anterior thigh
with the ureter brought out to the skin. Some
of these recipients were treated with ACTH,
cortisone, and testosterone. Only four kidneys
showed any function, and in three of these, function was brief. But, remarkably, one transplant
functioned for 5.5 months before it was rejected.
This helped sustain the hope that in humans the
outcome of homografts might be better than
predicted from animal transplants, thus possibly
justifying continued attempts made in as many
as six more patientsthat were never reported. But
in the opinion of most physicians of the time, the
Paris and Boston experience confirmed the futility of kidney homografts, proving that such human experimentation was unwarranted and unethical. However, two landmark events would
soon conspire to brush aside this pessimism
and launch the modern era of transplantation.
PRELUDE TO THE MODERN ERA
The prelude to the modern era of transplantation began by chance. During World War II,
Peter Medawar, a young Oxford zoologist who
had no previous interest in transplantation, was
assigned to join plastic surgeon Thomas Gibson
in exploring the use of skin homografts for
treatment of burned aviators (Gibson and Medawar 1943). Working in the Burn Unit of Glasgow’s Royal Infirmary, they soon reconfirmed
that homografts always failed. Medawar attributed to Gibson the credit for their rediscovery of
the “second set phenomenon” previously described in animals by several others including
Scho¨ne in 1912 and in a human patient by Emile
Holman in 1921 (Scho¨ne 1912; Holman 1924).
Like the earlier researchers, they realized that

this identified rejection as an immunological
event. This important observation and its interpretation are often credited to Medawar as
an original discovery and a novel insight. They
were not, but Medawar’s many subsequent contributions were so important, his experiments
so precise, and his speaking and writing so masterful that he rightfully deserved to be considered the central figure in the emerging field of
transplantation.
Returning to Oxford after the war, Medawar
conducted extensive studies of skin homografts
in rabbits, more firmly characterizing the timing, histological morphology, and immunological nature of rejection (Medawar 1944). Partly
because Medawar was unaware of James B. Murphy’s work on the lymphoid system 20 years earlier and refused to believe Leo Loeb’s similar
findings of the 1930s, he remained convinced
for another decade that grafts failed because of
humoral rather than cellular immunity (Brent
1997). Frustrated that no antibody could be
detected, Medawar then turned his attention
away from transplant rejection. Instead, he and
his first graduate student, Rupert Billingham,
began to study the esoteric phenomenon that,
in spotted guinea pigs, the pigmented areas of
skin autografts gradually encroach on the surrounding white skin (Billingham and Medawar
1948).
Soon after this, Medawar accepted the Chair
of Zoology at the University of Birmingham,
recruiting Billingham to join his faculty. Together they continued to study pigment spread.
In 1949, serendipity assumed importance in
the story. At a cocktail party Medawar talked
with his faculty colleague Hugh Donald, who
was studying twin cattle. Donald asked whether
identical twins could be distinguished from
fraternal twins. Medawar responded that skin
grafts exchanged between twins would be accepted only by the identical ones.
When Donald requested that he perform
such skin grafting experiments, Medawar was
reluctant because he was uncomfortable with
the prospect of handling large animals. Therefore, he enlisted the aid of his junior colleague,
Billingham, who as the grandson of a dairy farmer was not afraid of cows. Billingham and
Medawar had little scientific interest in the outcome of the skin grafts, which they felt was entirely predictable. However, the results were unexpectedly interesting (Billingham 1991) (Fig. 2).
They found that most cows accepted their
twin’s graft, a surprising result because they
knew that most cattle twins are fraternal and
some of the twin pairs they grafted were of different genders (Anderson et al. 1951). Totally
puzzled by this finding, they discussed it with
Hugh Donald, who suggested that they read a
paper published 4 years earlier in Science. When
they did so, the significance of their results suddenly became clear.
To place the cattle twin chapterof the storyof
tolerance in proper context, it is necessary to go
back 200 years. In 1779, the English surgeon
John Hunter provided the first anatomical description of the freemartin, a term used for the
generally sterile female of a pair of cattle twins
of unlike sex. Hunter dissected freemartins,
finding that they had masculinized sex organs
(Palmer 1835). That Hunter was unable to explain this curious phenomenon is ironic because
he was an authority on the circulation of the
placenta.

unexpected acceptance of grafts exchanged between
chimeric bovine fraternal twins was the key to understanding tolerance. (The photograph is a gift from the
private collection of Rupert Billingham, who was the

The next important link in the story was
provided in 1916 when Frank Lillie, an embryologist at the University of Chicago, dissected
a pair of unborn cattle twins (Lillie 1916). He
found that the chorions of the twins’ placentas
were fused, causing a common intrauterine circulation that would allow blood to be exchanged
freely between the twins. Like John Hunter, Lillie
also found that when cattle twins were of unlike
sex, the gonads of the female were usually rudimentary. He reasoned that male hormones circulating through the female embryo inhibited
the development of its reproductive organs.
Three decades later, in 1945, Ray Owen at
the University of Wisconsin wrote the next
chapter. In studying erythrocytes in cattle,
Owen found that in this species fraternal twins
frequently had a mixture of two red blood cell
types (Owen 1945). Recalling Lillie’s finding of
placental fusion of bovine twin embryos, Owen
concluded that not only hormones but also cellular elements of the blood must be exchanged
in utero by twin cattle. He realized that persistence of red blood cell chimerism in adulthood
must depend on intrauterine transfer not only
of short-lived red blood cells but also of stem
cells that would perpetuate them.
Six years after the publication of Owen’s
largely forgotten paper, Billingham and Medawar read it with fascination and suddenly understood why cattle accepted their fraternal
twin’s graft. They realized that, like the freemartins studied by Hunter, Lillie, and Owen before
them, their twins must have exchanged blood in
utero and that the donor cell chimerism persisted in adulthood. They reasoned that the stem
cells exchanged in utero by these twins would
be not only those for red blood cells but also
for leukocytes, and that these were probably responsible for skin graft acceptance. They also
realized at once with considerable excitement
that it might be easy for them to repeat Nature’s
bovine twin experiment in other species. In
1951, Billingham and Medawar moved to University College, London. Medawar said, “Thank
God we’ve left those cows behind.”
In London, Billingham, Medawar, and graduate student Leslie Brent set out to induce chimerism and homograft acceptance in mice
by inoculating intrauterine fetuses with donor
strain spleen cells (Fig. 3). In retrospect, they
were quite lucky to have achieved any successes.
By chance, the inbred strains they chose for the
experiments were CBA and A, virtually the only
H-2-incompatible combination available to
them in which neither graft-versus-host disease
nor incompatibility of skin-specific antigens
would cause death or rejection of the graft.
In adulthood, survivors of their intrauterine
inocula accepted skin grafts but only from the
Figure 3. Rupert Billingham and Leslie Brent in their laboratory, where they inoculated neonatal mice with
spleen cells (upper insert). In adulthood, the mice accepted skin homografts from the donor strain (lower insert).

spleen cell donor strain (Billingham et al. 1953).
Like the cattle work, it showed that allograft
rejection was not inevitable. Surprisingly, neither the publication of the work in October
1953 nor its presentation at a New York Transplantation meeting the next year had sudden
dramatic impact, in part because of Medawar’s
statement that it had no clinical implication
(Hamilton 2012, pp. 225–226). Over time,
however, it is clear that no other experiment in
the field has approached the importance of their
demonstration that induction of chimerism can
prevent graft rejection. It resulted in Medawar’s
1966 Nobel Prize, and it reverberates in presentday clinical trials to induce tolerance.
During their experiments to induce tolerance, Billingham and Brent made another quite
unexpected observation. Many of their chimeric
mice were sickly “runts.” They soon determined
that this was because immunocompetent cells in
the neonatal inocula migrated to and attacked
the lymphoid tissues of their new hosts—that
is, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Although
they briefly reported this in 1957, publication
of their conclusive proof was delayed until 1959
by Brent’s extended sabbatical with Ray Owen
(Brent 1991). Meanwhile, in 1957, Morton Simonsen had independently discovered and published his evidence for GVHD in chickens that
he had injected as embryos with allogeneic
lymphoid cells (Simonsen 1957, 1985). That to
cause GVHD, lymphocytes must be mobile was
among the findings belatedly inducing Medawar to accept the importance of cellular immunity, of which he became the foremost proponent. Even better evidence of cellular immunity
was provided by Avrion Mitchison’s demonstration that immunity to tumor grafts could be
transferred by cells but not antibody (Mitchison
1954). Final proof of lymphocyte mobility came
in 1959 when James Gowans (Gowans 1957)
showed that lymphocytes recirculate from blood
to lymph and back again.
THE FIRST SUCCESSES
In Boston, barely 14 months after the initial
report of tolerance in chimeric mice by Billingham, Brent, and Medawar, came the next landmark. On December 23, 1954, Joseph Murray
bypassed the barrier of rejection by using the
patient’s identical twin as the donor of a human
kidney transplant (Fig. 4) (Murray et al. 1955;
Merrill et al. 1956). In retrospect, the success of
this transplant had no real scientific significance
because technical accomplishment of human
kidney transplants was nothing new and it had
also been known for decades that skin grafts
exchanged between identical twins were not rejected (Brown 1937). But, the impact of this first
successful human transplant was immediate
and profound. Widespread enthusiastic reports
were an important stimulus for surgeons to
pursue further efforts in transplantation. But
because induction of chimerism in human recipients by neonatal treatment was clearly impossible, another approach would be necessary.
The next year, one was found by Joan Main and
Richmond Prehn, who showed that weakening
the immune system of adult mice by radiation
allowed them to induce chimerism by inoculating bone marrow cells. Skin grafts were then
accepted if they came from the bone marrow
donor strain (Main and Prehn 1955). This and
the similar success of the method in one dog
kidney homograft (Mannick et al. 1959) encouraged transplantation teams in Paris and
Boston to pursue this approach for preventing
rejection of human kidney homografts.
In 1958, Murray’s team used the Main–
Prehn strategy in two human kidney recipients
that they conditioned with lethal total body irradiation (TBI) and donor bone marrow. Ten
other patients were treated with sublethal TBI
without bone marrow. Disappointingly, 11 of
the 12 irradiated patients died within a month
(Murray et al. 1962). The survivor (who was not
given bone marrow) maintained adequate function of his fraternal twin brother’s kidney for 20
years. Scientifically, this was a more important
accomplishment than the identical twin case
because it was the first time the genetic barrier
to human kidney transplantation had been
breached (Merrill et al. 1960). Five months later
in Paris, Jean Hamburger and colleagues (Hamburger et al. 1959) using the same irradiation
treatment were successful with another fraternal twin transplant, which functioned until the

patient’s death from unrelated causes 26 years
later.
In these two dizygotic twin cases, there was
speculation that the donor and recipient, like
twin cattle, had become chimeric by exchanging tolerogenic blood cells during gestation.
However, between 1960 and 1962 in Paris, Jean
Hamburger and Rene´ Ku¨ss showed that this
was unnecessary by performing four successful
transplants in nontwin recipients conditioned
by total body irradiation (Ku¨ss 1962). This
French experience was the principal (and perhaps the only) justification for continuing human kidney transplantation. Because bone marrow inocula were not used in these patients, it
was assumed that chimerism was not necessary
for success.
CHEMICAL IMMUNOSUPPRESSION
Although Hamburger and Ku¨ss both used adrenal cortical steroids as an adjunct to TBI and
Ku¨ss secondarily administered 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) to one of his irradiated patients,
there was as yet no systematic investigation of
drug-based immunosuppression as a substitute
for radiation. In the 1950s, oncologists were
evaluating drugs including nitrogen mustard
and 6-MP for treatment of malignancies. In
1959, interest was drawn to the use of such drugs
for transplantation by the report of an experiment by Robert Schwartz and William Dameshek at Tufts University. They found in rabbits
that 6-MP reduced the antibody response to bovine albumen (Schwartz and Dameshek 1959).
In 1960, they reported that the drug modestly extended the survival of skin homografts
(Schwartz and Dameshek 1960). When Roy
Calne, a surgical trainee in London, learned of
these experiments, he tested the effect of 6-MP
on rejection of dog kidney homografts and
found that it significantly prolonged their survival. He promptly reported this in Lancet
(Calne 1960). Simultaneously, Charles Zukoski
working in Richmond with David Hume independently made the same observation, but
his report in the Surgical Forum did not appear
until the following year (Zukoski et al. 1960).
Calne also treated three human kidney recipients with 6-MP, but they all died without showing any function of the transplant (Hopewell
et al. 1964).

In 1960, with Medawar’s help, Calne obtained a research fellowship with Joseph Murray
in Boston. Although Murrayadvised him to pursue the Brigham’s ongoing experiments with
whole body irradiation, Calne began working
instead with 6-MP and its derivative azathioprine, which he obtained from Gertrude Elion
and George Hitchings (Hitchings and Elion
1954), who were subsequently awarded the Nobel Prize for development of these immunosuppressive agents. Calne’s demonstration that in
dogs kidney transplant rejection could sometimes be delayed substantially with these drugs
stimulated the Brigham team to begin using
them in human kidney recipients.
NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL
CONFERENCE
In 1963, one of the most important landmarks
in the history of transplantation was revealed
during a small conference organized by the National Research Council (NRC). About 25 individuals including most of the world’s active
transplant clinicians and scientists assembled
in Washington to review the status of human
kidney transplantation. The results presented
by these acknowledged experts were extremely
discouraging. Less than 10% of their several
hundred allograft recipients had survived as
long as 3 months (Goodwin and Martin 1963).
Of patients treated with total body irradiation,
only six had approached or achieved 1 year survival (Starzl 2000). Hope was expressed that
immunosuppressive drugs might be more effective. Murray reported his first 10 patients
treated with 6-MP and azathioprine instead
of irradiation (Murray et al. 1963). One had
survived for a year, although at the time of
the conference it was failing. The others died
within 6 months. Thus, at this point, drugs
seemed no more effective than radiation. The
mood at the conference was so gloomy that
some participants questioned whether continued activity in human transplantation could be
justified (Ku¨ss 1992).
The gloom was dispelled by only one presentation given by Tom Starzl, a virtually unknown
newcomer to the field, who was invited to
the conference as an afterthought. He described
a new immunosuppressive protocol that had allowed .70% 1-year renal graft survival. He had
more surviving patients than the rest of the
world’s better known participants combined.
At first, his audience was incredulous. Tapes
that recorded the subsequent sometimes acrimonious discussions were lost, but eventually
Starzl’s unprecedented results had to be believed
because he had brought with him charts detailing the daily progress of each patient—including
laboratory tests, urine output, and immunosuppressive drug doses (Hamilton 2012, pp. 279–
280, 487). Starzl’s innovation based on his consistent success in reversing homograft rejection
in dogs was to add prednisone to azathioprine.
Although rejection usually occurred in patients
on azathioprine alone, it was usually reversible
with large doses of prednisone. In most patients,
drug doses could then be diminished without
provoking rejection. This presentation caused
a sensation (Ku¨ss 1992). The formal report of
the conference consolidated the results of all
participants. This failed to stress and seemed
almost to obfuscate the dramatic reaction to
Starzl’s presentation. In fact, the impact on those
present was extraordinary. They would have
been still more impressed if they could have
known that half a century later, some of the patients Starzl described would be off immunosuppression with the same functioning allografts and that they would have been found
microchimeric with their donors’ lymphoid
cells.
The outlook for renal transplantation was
completely changed by Starzl’s report. Transplant historian Nick Tilney described it as “letting the genie out of the bottle” (Tilney 2003).
Many of the conference attendees promptly visited Starzl in Denver to learn how to adopt his
immunosuppressive protocol (Starzl 1990). The
news of the breakthrough spread quickly by its
publication 5 weeks later (Starzl et al. 1963). Before the NRC conference, there had been only
three active renal transplant centers in North
America (Boston, Denver, and Richmond). As
the effectiveness of Starzl’s innovative immunosuppression became known, within a year 50
new transplant programs began in the United

States alone. All of them and others that began
subsequently adopted the Starzl “cocktail immunosuppression.” In fact, this protocol remained the virtual world standard for almost
the next two decades (Brent 1997).
A PERIOD OF CONSOLIDATION
The next quarter century, 1964–1980, is often
classified as a period of consolidation or plateau.
During this period, except for the development
of antilymphocytic serum (in large part responsible for the first albeit marginal success of extrarenal transplants), there were no landmarks.
Importantly, however, there was steady progress.
Practical innovations and accomplishments
took place that were necessary for maturation
of kidney transplantation into a useful clinical
service. These included availability of dialysis;
Medicare funding of end-stage renal disease; antibody screening to avoid hyperacute rejection;
the importance of tissue typing for related donor transplants; acceptance of brain death; ex
vivo preservation, allowing donor organs to be
transported and shared;, and, perhaps most importantly, the accumulation of experience in patient management that led to the avoidance of
over-immunosuppression, thereby decreasing
resultant infections and deaths.
Hemolysis
Hemodialysis for renal failure was pioneered in
Holland by Willem Kolff during World War II,
but chronic renal failure could be treated only
after Belding Scribner in 1960 devised Teflon
arteriovenous conduits for long-term vascular
access (Kapoian 1997). Before that, each dialysis
treatment used up an accessible artery and vein
until they ran out. In 1966, James Cimino and
Michael Brescia introduced subcutaneous anastamoses of an artery and vein at the wrist to
arterialize superficial arm veins that could
then be accessed by simple needle puncture.
But even in the late 1960s, chronic dialysis was
available in only a few centers, and in these expense limited its use to a small number of patients. Proliferation of centers able to offer
chronic dialysis and transplantation took place
only after Congress in 1972 approved Medicare
funding for patients of any age with end-stage
renal disease.
Brain Death
Before the mid 1960s, utilization of kidneys
from deceased donors was limited by the ischemic damage that set in as soon as the heart
stopped beating, this being the time-honored
definition of death. During the next few years,
there was gradual although controversial acceptance that irreversible loss of brain function was
also a form of death and one that would allow
removal of organs from a “heart-beating cadaver.” In 1968, the “Harvard ad hoc Committee on
Brain Death” published its recommendation
that irreversible loss of brain function be accepted as death (Harvard Medical School 1968).
Uneasiness that this might be influenced by
the desire of transplanters to recover organs
from possibly salvageable patients and criticism
over the poor outcomes of the first heart transplants that were being performed during this
same period fueled controversy over this concept. But eventually, brain death was widely accepted, a crucial factor in increasing numbers of
transplants, especially of extra renal organs.
Organ Preservation
As early as 1905, Carrel’s colleague Charles
Guthrie had advocated cooling to protect donor
organs before transplantation (Hamilton 2012,
p. 101). That it was not used in early human
transplants probably in part accounted for their
poor results. Initially, Starzl used total body
hypothermia to protect donor organs, but by
1960 switched to infusing cold solution into
the portal vein to protect donor livers (Marchioro et al. 1963). By 1963, pretransplant infusion of cold solution into the renal artery
of donor kidneys became standard (Collins
1969). When multiple organs were procured
from a donor, in situ cooling by infusion of
cold solution to the aorta was used. Ex vivo perfusion of isolated kidneys by a pump (reminiscent of Lindberg’s machine in the 1930s) was
shown to extend preservation of kidneys for

2–3 days (Belzer et al. 1967), but the popularity
of this method waned after 1987 when Folkert
Belzer introduced University of Wisconsin solution, which when simply infused into blood
vessels of donor organs allowed preservation almost as long (Belzer et al. 1992).
Donor Organ Sharing
After donor kidney preservation of up to 6 hours
was accomplished in the mid-1960s, sharing of
organs between centers became practical. At
first, sharing was local and informal. In 1967,
Paul Terasaki started the first sharing organization in Los Angeles (Terasaki 1990). The Boston
Interhospital Organ Bank followed in 1968. Subsequently, perceptions arose that local control
allowed inequity of donor organ allocation.
There was concern that U.S. organs were sent
abroad or transplanted at U.S. centers into foreign nationals. Recognition of a need to formalize distribution of donor organs at a national
level led Congress to pass the National Transplant Act in 1984. The Southeastern Organ
Procurement Foundation (SEOPF), founded
in 1969 and eventually composed of 12 hospitals in several cities, served as the template for the
resultant national entity that now controls organ
allocation and placement, monitors performance of transplant centers and organ procurement organizations, collects data, and controls
quality—the United Network for Organ Sharing
(UNOS) (McDonald 1988). UNOS has been a
force for order and good, but to some its effectiveness has seemed compromised by the excessive scale of its tasks and the number and size of
its committees and inevitable bureaucracy. Adjustments in appropriate organ allocation in
response to changes in the relative importance
of histocompatibility and issues of equity have
been difficult, prolonged, and politicized.
Histocompatibility Typing
Although tissue matching was suggested by
Alexis Carrel and studied in animals by George
Snell and by Peter Gorer, it could not begin to
emerge as a reality for human transplants until 1958, when Jean Dausset discovered the first
human leukocyte antigen (HLA) (Snell 1948;
Dausset 1958). Antibodies against this antigen
were identified in transfused patients and multiparous women by Rose Payne (1957) and Jon
van Rood (van Rood et al. 1958) soon after. Testing for antibodies (by agglutination techniques)
was cumbersome and inconsistent until Paul
Terasaki in 1964 developed a microcytotoxicity
assay (Terasaki 1964). His test, which mixed recipient serum and donor lymphocytes in tiny
wells, quickly became the standard. For several
years, Terasaki did the typing for most U.S. transplant centers. Several of his early findings were of
lasting importance (Terasaki 1990): (1) a positive cross-match test identifying donor-specific
antibodies in the serum of a prospective kidney
recipient predicts hyperacute rejection; and (2)
matching can reliably identify the optimal donor within a family. It was next assumed by histocompatibility experts that matching would be
just as important in selection of unrelated donors. However, in 1970, when Terasaki examined
his large database (1216 kidney transplant patients from 52 centers) to relate typing with outcome of cadaver renal allografts, he found no
correlation. Terasaki’s announcement of this at
the Transplantation Congress in the Hague elicited consternation in members of the tissue typing community, who contended that his methods must be faulty (Terasaki 1990). His paper
was the only one not accepted for publication
in the conference proceedings. NIH made an
emergency site visit to Terasaki’s laboratory
and abruptly withdrew his grant, closing down
most of his research. His funding was subsequently restored when others confirmed that
his findings were correct. Since that time, typing
has improved, with identification of many additional histocompatibility antigens including
those of the important Class II locus (D or
DR) (Ting and Morris 1978). Histocompatibility matching remains crucial in bone marrow
transplantation and important in selection of
family donors. But even now for unrelated donor organ transplants, the benefit remains much
less unless there is a perfect match.
Additional important findings that took
place during the consolidation period are listed
because space precludes their full discussion:

1. Blood transfusions, rather than decreasing
the chance of kidney allograft survival, were
found during the 1970s to improve it. This
still-not-understood observation by Gerhard
Opelz and others led to protocols of deliberate
pretransplant transfusions (Opelz et al. 1973).
However, this strategy was abandoned when
the even greater improvement due to cyclosporine obscured the benefits of transfusions.
2. In some pigs and rats, liver homografts survived without immunosuppression and also
induced acceptance of other types of graft
from the liver donor (Calne 1969; Kamada
1980).
3. William Summerlin’s report that pretransplant culture of skin allografts allowed their
acceptance without immunosuppression
was greeted with excitement but was subsequently proven to be fraudulent. Summerlin
was painting the grafts to make them look
viable (Medawar 1996).
4. The origin of multiple transplantation societies, journals, national and international
meetings, and registries of clinical results ensured prompt dissemination of scientific and
clinical findings to a degree not seen in other
fields.
EXTRARENAL ORGAN TRANSPLANTS
During the period of consolidation, transplantation of nonrenal organs (liver, heart, and pancreas) began. These landmarks are subjects of
other articles in this collection. Their initial success (albeit marginal) was promoted by
improvement in immunosuppression by antilymphocyte serum (ALS), which thus in itself
deserves landmark status. Further improvement
awaited cyclosporine.
ANTILYMPHOCYTE SERUM
Antilymphocyte serum (ALS) had a prolonged
evolution. At the end of the nineteenth century,
Elie Metchnikoff proposed the use of antiserum
to mitigate cellular immunity (Metchnikoff
1899), a concept reexplored six decades later
by Byron Waksman (Waksman et al. 1961). Depletion of lymphocytes with antiserum was a
logical extension of Gowans’s finding (Gowans
et al. 1963) that thoracic duct drainage delayed
skin graft rejection in rats. In 1963, Michael
Woodruff reported that ALS was remarkably
effective in extending skin allograft survival in
rodent models (Woodruff and Anderson 1963).
Monaco et al. (1966) and Levey and Medawar
(1966) reported similar success. In 1966, Starzl
was the first to use ALS clinically. After finding
it effective for kidney allografts, he also credited
it with allowing his first successful human liver
transplants in 1967 (Starzl et al. 1967a,b). Many
others, including Anthony Monaco, John Najarian, and A.G. Sheil, treated patients with
homemade ALS from rabbits or horses immunized with lymph node cells or cultured lymphoblasts before pharmaceutical companies began to produce it. Variability in effectiveness of
different batches of this polyclonal antiserum
was troublesome before the advent of monoclonal derivatives of ALS that were directed first
at all T lymphocytes and subsequently at their
subsets or their interleukin 2 receptors (Cosimi
et al. 1981). These agents have become a mainstay of the modern immunosuppressive armamentarium, especially for induction therapy.
Cyclosporine and Tacrolimus
The next landmark was the “wonder drug” cyclosporine. After a slow start, it revolutionized
transplantation by substantially improving kidney transplant results and greatly facilitating
successful extrarenal transplants. Cyclosporine
is a fungal derivative first reported in 1976 by
Jean-Franc¸ois Borel to have immunosuppressive
qualities (Borel et al. 1976). Following several
years of encouraging animal experiments, Calne
began in 1979 to use it as a single agent in treatment of human kidney recipients, finding it to
be more potent than azathioprine but also toxic
in higher doses, leading to infections, lymphomas, and renal failure (Calne et al. 1979). Results
of initial trials in Boston and Canada rated it as
unimpressive to poor, causing some to believe
the drug should be abandoned. Once again as he
had before with azathioprine, Starzl by adding

prednisone to the new drug developed a protocol that strikingly improved outcomes of kidney
transplants (Starzl et al. 1980). In addition, this
transformed transplantation of extrarenal organs into a practical clinical service (Starzl et
al. 1981).
Cyclosporine soon became the standard
baseline immunosuppressant and remained so
until 1989, when it was shown by Starzl that
rejection of liver and other organ allografts resistant to treatment by cyclosporine, steroids,
and antibodies could often by reversed by an
even more potent drug, tacrolimus (Starzl et al.
1989). Tacrolimus has now in large part replaced
cyclosporine as the usual baseline agent.
Chimerism
Modern immunosuppression with agents such
as cyclosporine/tacrolimus and T-cell antibodies now allows excellent short- and midterm survival of allografts, for 1 year exceeding 90% for
kidney and approaching this for other organs.
Nevertheless, because of ongoing morbidity
from drug toxicity and graft loss from chronic
rejection, achievement of drug-free immunosuppression remains the ultimate goal. Plans
for inducing tolerance invariably start with review of the 1953 demonstration by Billingham,
Brent, and Medawar that chimerism induced in
neonatal mice by lymphoid cell inocula allows
acceptance of donor strain skin grafts. Main and
Prehn’s subsequent success by infusion of donor
cells to irradiated adult mice inspired pioneer
transplanters in Boston and Paris to test this
method in a small number of human kidney allograft recipients, but with no success. When in
several irradiated human recipients, graft survival was achieved without donor cell inocula
and in others achieved with immunosuppressive drugs alone, it appeared that donor cell
chimerism was irrelevant to long-term allograft
success.
In animal models, there has been continued
exploration of donor cell inocula (combined
with immunosuppression) for inducing chimerism and tolerance of allografts (Monaco
et al. 1966; Lance and Medawar 1969; Thomas
et al. 1987). But in humans between 1959 and
1990, there were only a few trials of this strategy,
the first by Monaco et al. (1976) and the largest
by W.H. Barber and A.G. Diethelm, who treated
57 kidney recipients with an induction course
of ALG and cryopreserved donor bone marrow
given 17 days after transplantation (Barber et al.
1991). Their results were equivocal, although
early graft rejection seemed less than in the control group.
In 1992, attention was dramatically refocused on the role of chimerism in human allograft survival. Tom Starzl discovered that donor
leukocyte chimerism was present in patients
who had maintained successful kidney or liver
grafts for up to three decades (Starzl et al. 1993).
Sensitive immunochemical and molecular assays were necessary to detect donor cells, which
in some patients were not found in blood but
only in biopsies of skin, lymph nodes, and other
tissues. This extensive search determined that a
microchemic state was present in all 30 patients
studied.
Because these recipients had not been given
donor cells, the chimeric cells could only have
reached them as passengers migrating from the
donor organ. Many of the patients appeared
to be tolerant, because they were off all immunosuppression. This finding was the basis of
Starzl’s belief that chimerism is an important
cause (not the consequence) of successful transplantation, culminating in his hypothesis of a
two-way paradigm for tolerance—that is, successful engraftment is the result of the responses
of coexisting donor and recipient cells each to
the other causing reciprocal clonal exhaustion
followed by peripheral clonal deletion (Starzl
et al. 1992, 1996). This interpretation has been
rebutted by Kathryn Wood, David Sachs, and
others who argue that persistent microchimerism induced by a donor organ is as likely to be
the effect as the cause of tolerance (Wood and
Sachs 1996). Whatever the resolution of this
debate, it is clear that Starzl’s demonstration
of microchimerism in his patients has been an
important stimulus for reexploration of this approach to allograft tolerance by trials described
in Markmann and Kawai 2012).

the last half century is one of Medicine’s great

stories. In support of this contention are the five
Nobel Prizes given for transplantation (19, if
related immunology is included). In addition,
this year’s Lasker Award to Tom Starzl and Roy
Calne brings to six the number of these prestigious awards for transplantation or related
work. The distribution of these Prizes has not
been without controversy. Largely forgotten rivalries that enrich the story are those between
Alexis Carrel and his colleague Charles Guthrie;
between the proponents of cellular immunity
(Elie Metchnikoff, James B. Murphy, Leo Loeb,
and Avrion Mitchison) and the champions of
humoral immunity (Paul Ehrlich, Peter Gorer,
and others, even including Peter Medawar during his early career); between transplant pioneers in Boston, Denver, and Paris, even between
two separate teams of transplanters. However, it
is notable and reassuring that in 1999, 12 of
the field’s surviving pioneers met to select and
agree on the “historical landmarks” briefly reviewed in this work (Groth et al. 2000) (Fig. 5).
The promise of further progress toward the ultimate achievement of tolerance is described in
subsequent work.
