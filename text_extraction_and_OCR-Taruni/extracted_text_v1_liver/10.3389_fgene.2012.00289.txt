Abnormal mineralization occurs in the context of several common conditions, including
advanced age, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, chronic renal failure, and certain genetic
conditions. Metabolic, mechanical, infectious, and inflammatory injuries promote ectopic
mineralization through overlapping yet distinct molecular mechanisms of initiation and
progression. The ABCC6 protein is an ATP-dependent transporter primarily found in the
plasma membrane of hepatocytes. ABCC6 exports unknown substrates from the liver
presumably for systemic circulation. ABCC6 deficiency is the primary cause for chronic
and acute forms of ectopic mineralization described in diseases such as pseudoxanthoma
elasticum (PXE), β-thalassemia, and generalized arterial calcification of infancy (GACI)
in humans and dystrophic cardiac calcification (DCC) in mice. These pathologies are
characterized by mineralization of cardiovascular, ocular, and dermal tissues. PXE and to
an extent GACI are caused by inactivating ABCC6 mutations, whereas the mineralization
associated with β-thalassemia patients derives from a liver-specific change in ABCC6
expression. DCC is an acquired phenotype resulting from cardiovascular insults (ischemic
injury or hyperlipidemia) and secondary to ABCC6 insufficiency. Abcc6-deficient mice
develop ectopic calcifications similar to both the human PXE and mouse DCC phenotypes.
The precise molecular and cellular mechanism linking deficient hepatic ABCC6 function
to distal ectopic mineral deposition is not understood and has captured the attention of
many research groups. Our previously published work along with that of others show
that ABCC6 influences other modulators of calcification and that it plays a much greater
physiological role than originally thought.

INTRODUCTION
In the absence of any systemic mineral imbalance, the calcification of soft tissues is defined as ectopic or dystrophic calcification.
The latter term specifically distinguishes ectopic calcification that
occurs in injured, damaged, and/or necrotic tissues. In contrast,
elevated levels of calcium and/or phosphate due to abnormal
absorption and/or secretion lead to metastatic mineralization.
Whether ectopic or metastatic, abnormal calcification is typically
composed of calcium phosphate salts, such as hydroxyapatite and
can affect most soft tissues. However, the skin, kidneys, tendons,
and cardiovascular tissues are particularly prone to this pathology.
Vascular calcification is a prevalent feature of aging and is
also frequently associated with a number of common pathologies that include hyperlipidemia (atherosclerosis), chronic renal
insufficiency, and diabetes, as well as certain infrequent genetic
conditions. Calcification was long thought to result from passive precipitation of calcium and phosphate but it is now recognized as a complex tightly regulated development involving
the osteoblastic differentiation of resident cells such as smooth
muscle cells (SMCs), pericytes or adventitial myofibroblasts. It
was also viewed as harmless, but calcification is in fact causative in
the precipitation of cardiovascular events and mediating chronic
damages to these tissues independently of the disease context
that brings it about. More importantly, a proliferation of recent
data has brought into light the many factors and the complex mechanisms that initiate and promote calcification in vivo
(Atzeni et al., 2006). Despite the significant improvement of our
understanding of calcification processes, how the delicate balance
between normal osteogenic signals and ectopic mineralization in
soft tissues is altered in pathological conditions is far from being
understood.
Based on multiple evidence gathered in the last decade, the
ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter ABCC6 has joined the
list of calcification regulators as a new member. Indeed, reduced
levels of ABCC6 protein or loss of ABCC6 function in the liver
has been linked to four separate ectopic mineralization pathologies in humans and mice. (1) Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE:
MIM 264800) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by

Le Saux et al. ABCC6 molecular and physiological roles
a slow and progressive ectopic calcification primarily affecting
elastic fibers in dermal, ocular, and vascular tissues. Inactivating
mutations in the ABCC6 gene cause PXE (Bergen et al., 2000;
Le Saux et al., 2000, 2001). (2) We have also shown, based
on results obtained with an animal model, that the calcification phenotype in some β-thalassemia patients of Mediterranean
descent (Baccarani-Contri et al., 2001; Aessopos et al., 2002),
while not directly caused by ABCC6 gene mutations (Hamlin
et al., 2003), probably results from reduced levels of ABCC6 protein in the liver. (3) Furthermore, generalized arterial calcification
of infancy (GACI) is another heritable disorder typically associated with mutations in the ENPP1 gene. It now appears that a
significant fraction of patients diagnosed with GACI are in fact
carriers of ABCC6 mutations while typical PXE manifestations
can be associated with ENPP1 mutations in some young patients
(Le Boulanger et al., 2010; Nitschke et al., 2012). (4) Recently,
two groups of investigators have established that deficiency of
the ABCC6 protein is linked to an acute calcification phenotype affecting the myocardium and the media of large arteries in
several inbred strains of mice, including C3H/HeJ and DBA/2J
(Aherrahrou et al., 2004, 2008; Meng et al., 2007). Because this
peculiar phenotype occurs in response to a tissue injury it is
referred to as dystrophic cardiac calcification or DCC.
The aim of this review is to summarize present knowledge
on ABCC6 function and its possible molecular and physiological roles in various calcification pathologies where there clearly is
more than meets the eye with this unique ABC transporter.
THE MOLECULAR CHARACTERISTICS OF ABCC6
ABCC6 IS AN EFFLUX PUMP
ABCC6 is a member of the large ABC gene subfamily C. In this
group of transmembrane proteins, in addition to active transporters such as ABCC1, −2, −3, −4, and −5, there are also ion
channel-forming proteins and ion channel regulators like ABCC7
(CFTR), ABCC8 and −9 (SUR1 and −2). The work of Ilias et al.
(2002) and Belinsky et al. (2002) have shown that ABCC6 is
a genuine active efflux transporter that uses ATP to effectively
pump a glutathione conjugate of N-ethylmaleimide (NEM-GS)
and also leukotriene C4 (LTC4). The affinity of ABCC6 for LTC4
was much lower than for NEM-GS and overall the maximal rate
of NEM-GS transport was markedly inferior to two other wellknown glutathione conjugate-transporting proteins, ABCC1 and
ABCC2. Interestingly, ABCC6 failed to effectively transport 17-βestradiol-17-β-D-glucuronide that is otherwise a recognized a
substrate for ABCC3 (Hirohashi et al., 1999). The same study
also found that the most effective inhibitors for ABCC6 were
benzbromarone and indomethacin. These in vitro observations
demonstrated that ABCC6 has a defined perhaps restricted, substrate specificity. Though the actual endogenous substrate(s) for
this transporter and hence the contributing factor to ectopic
calcification in PXE, β-thalassemia, GACI, and DCC remains
unknown.
ABCC6 STRUCTURE
A 3D configuration of ABCC6 was successfully modeled using
the X-ray structure of the Staphylococcus aureus Sav1866 export
pump (Dawson and Locher, 2007). This prokaryote pump has
already been used as template to build other homology models for the several human ABCC transporters such as ABCC1
(DeGorter et al., 2008), ABCC4 (Ravna and Sager, 2008), ABCC5
(Ravna et al., 2007), ABCC7/CFTR (Serohijos et al., 2008) as
well as ABCB1 (Zolnerciks et al., 2007), ABCG2 (Li et al., 2007).
Fülöp et al. have used their model of ABCC6 and the distribution of PXE-causing mutations to demonstrate the strict relevance of the transmission interface (ICL-ABC contacts) as well
as the ABC-ABC domain contacts for the function of the transporter (Fulop et al., 2009). For more information on the structure/function relation of ABCC6, see the review of Arányi et al.
in this issue.
CELLULAR LOCALIZATION OF ABCC6
ABCC6 protein has thus far been unambiguously associated with
the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes in mice, rat, and human
samples (Madon et al., 2000; Beck et al., 2003; Le Saux et al.,
2011) as well as in the proximal kidney tubules and a kidney
cell line (Sinko et al., 2003; Beck et al., 2005). Although a recent
publication is unconvincingly attempting to challenge the already
well-defined cellular localization of ABCC6 (Martin et al., 2012),
it is interesting to note that PXE-causing missense mutations in
ABCC6 do lead to defective cellular localization of the protein
along with other functional alterations of the translated proteins (Le Saux et al., 2011). Although a relatively small number
of mutants were analyzed, two possible outcomes of pathological mutations were described: (1) failure to use ATP causing
transport deficiency and (2) the altered folding and/or protein
stability leading to intracellular retention and reduced trafficking
or a combination thereof. Therefore, the various structural and
functional alterations of mutated ABCC6 presumably all result
in the loss of physiological function, which provides a reasonable explanation for the observed lack of phenotype–genotype
correlation in PXE (Le Saux et al., 2001; Chassaing et al., 2005;
Pfendner et al., 2007).
ABCC6 SUBSTRATE(S) CONUNDRUM
Since the identification of ABCC6 as the causative gene for
PXE (Bergen et al., 2000; Le Saux et al., 2000), the question
of its substrate(s) has thus far eluded all interested parties, and
indeed the identification of an endogenous substrate(s) for an
ABC transporter is not an easy task. Our knowledge to date is
based on limited experimental data showing ABCC6’s ability to
use ATP to extrude conjugated metabolites in vitro (Belinsky
et al., 2002; Ilias et al., 2002). Because the protein rests in the
basolateral membrane of polarized cells, the prevailing hypothesis stipulates that the inability of this transporter to secrete
its unknown substrate(s) for systemic circulation is the primary
cause of the ectopic calcification phenotype of PXE, some GACI,
and β-thalassemia patients and for DCC. This has prompted
some to describe PXE as a metabolic disorder (Uitto et al.,
2001), which could also apply to DCC and the ABCC6-dependent
GACI and β-thalassemia cases. The metabolic hypothesis implies
that the ABCC6 substrate(s) ultimately acts as an inhibitor of
calcification in peripheral tissues. Does it work as a signaling
molecule(s) that diffuses from the circulation into connective
tissues where it contributes the normal phenotype of resident

cells such as fibroblasts, or SMCs (Quaglino et al., 2000; Boraldi
et al., 2003)? Or does it interact directly with the extracellular matrix, collagen fibrils, elastic fibers thereby precluding
oxidative stress (Garcia-Fernandez et al., 2008), abnormal assembly/deposition of collagen fibrils (Gheduzzi et al., 2003) and
elastic fiber (Le Saux et al., 2006) calcification and fragmentation? As multiple structural and molecular alterations have
been noted in PXE notably the so-called “collagen flowers,” elastorrhexis along with abnormal glycoaminoglycans depositions
(Lebwohl et al., 1993; Passi et al., 1996; Quaglino et al., 2000;
Baccarani-Contri et al., 2001; Gheduzzi et al., 2003; Gotting et al.,
2005) it is possible that a combination of molecular and cellular processes contribute to all the molecular and structural
changes that have been described up to now (Figure 1). These
interrogations clearly reflect a lack of sufficient data to even speculate as to the nature of the ABCC6 physiological substrate(s).
And, in such situations, there are two possible approaches.
Either one tests candidate molecules or performs a systematic
search.
CANDIDATE ABCC6 SUBSTRATES
Reports by Vanakker and co-workers prompted several laboratories to test one such candidate molecule. The first of two
publications described a PXE-like syndrome caused by a deficiency in gamma-glutamyl carboxylase (GGCX) (Vanakker et al.,
2007) and a second article reported a deficit in the carboxylation
(activation) of Gla proteins, including the calcification inhibitor
Matrix Gla Protein (MGP), secondary to reduced vitamin K levels
in the circulation of PXE patients (Vanakker et al., 2010). Because
the common denominator between both reports is the vitamin K,
the speculation that this co-factor could be an ABCC6 substrate
was proposed (Borst et al., 2008) and tested in both indirect and
direct experiments. The indirect approaches focused on phenotype correction in animal models of PXE, namely the calcification
of vibrissae, with diets enriched in phylloquinone (vitamin K1)
and menaquinones (vitamin K2). Three independent studies were
carried out and all obtained negative results (Brampton et al.,
2011; Gorgels et al., 2011; Jiang et al., 2011). These results were
later confirmed by the direct observation that ABCC6 failed to

effectively transport a glutathione conjugate of vitamin K3, unlike
ABCC1 (Fulop et al., 2011). Vitamin K3 is an intermediate generated during the conversion of the dietary vitamin K1 to the most
abundant form vitamin K2.
More recently, another candidate molecule was tested on the
premise that adenosine has a key role in the etiology of arterial calcification due to deficiency of CD73 (ACDC), a rare
condition that has phenotypic similarities with PXE (Markello
et al., 2011). The ACDC mineralization primarily affects the
large lower limb arteries (femoral, popliteal, and tibial arteries) and cartilage tissues but spares the main arterial vessels of
the upper body. ACDC results from mutations in the NT5E
gene that encodes the 5 exonucleotidase CD73. This protein
is a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-anchored plasma membrane
protein that generates extracellular adenosine, downstream of
ENPP1 as part of the extracellular degradation pathway from
ATP to adenosine and inorganic phosphate. The calcification
in ACDC patients derives from an increase tissue non-specific
alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) expression as a consequence of
the lack of adenosine signaling. The partial overlap between the
PXE and ACDC phenotypes prompted Markello et al. to suggest that adenosine might be an ABCC6 substrate (Markello
et al., 2011). However, the limitations of this theory were quickly
apparent as CD73 contributed to calcification only in specific arterial territories without dermal or ocular involvement
(Leftheriotis et al., 2011b). Subsequent in vitro testing showed
that indeed ABCC6 did not efficiently transport adenosine
(Szabo et al., 2011).
THE SYSTEMATIC SEARCH FOR ABCC6 SUBSTRATE(S)
As for systematic approaches, at present three groups of laboratories are reportedly undertaking experiments using animal
or human tissue extracts and fluids that potentially contain the
ABCC6 substrate(s). Though no publications or public reports
has been made thus far, two of these groups have based their
technical approaches on the principle described by Krumpochova
et al. (2012) which use of a combination of inverted membrane
vesicles from Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells overproducing ABCC6 and liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy-based
metabolomics to determine the compounds transported into the
vesicles (Personal communications, O. Le Saux, A. Varadi, and
P. Borst). The third group of laboratories actively seeking the
ABCC6 substrate(s) uses the methodology reported by Van et al.
(2008): NMR spectroscopy with animal and/or human urine and
serum (Personal communications M. Dean).
THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG
As of today, the sum of current publications only paints a
relatively fragmented picture of the pathophysiological role of
ABCC6 that seem to favor a signaling/hormone-type of activity
for ABCC6 substrate(s) toward a variety of tissues, including but
not limited to, the connective tissue. For example, the observations that Fetuin-A, MGP (Hendig et al., 2006, 2008b), vitamin K
(Vanakker et al., 2010), osteogenic makers, and oxidative stress
(Pasquali-Ronchetti et al., 2006; Garcia-Fernandez et al., 2008;
Hendig et al., 2008a) are altered in the circulation of PXE patients
points indirectly to unbalanced homeostasis of multiple organs
and tissues. More direct evidence have shown the presence of
pathological metabolite(s) in the serum of PXE patients and
Abcc6−/− mice that promoted elastic fibers structural alterations
and ectopic calcification (Le Saux et al., 2006; Jiang et al., 2007).
Further, we have also described a significant expansion of the lymphatic vessel network in Abcc6−/− mice (Le Corre et al., 2012)
that emphasize the systemic and global nature of the physiological
changes that accompany and/or lead to the mineralization phenotype linked to ABCC6 deficiency. This calcification has always
been presented as the hallmark of PXE and the major pathological development DCC and GACI, but it might in fact be only the
visible tip of the iceberg.
THE PATHOPHYSIOLOGIES ASSOCIATED WITH ABCC6
DEFICIENCY
Little is known about ABCC6 other than it is a member of the
large ABC gene subfamily C (multi drug resistance proteins)
and encodes a transmembrane protein that uses ATP hydrolysis to export organic anion transport across cellular membranes.
Work to characterize the physiological role of ABCC6 has first
relied upon tissue expression profiles. ABCC6 is found primarily
expressed in liver and the kidneys but is also in the intestine, the
retina and to a much lesser extent in most other tissues including the lung, skin, and vasculature (Bergen et al., 2000; Beck
et al., 2003, 2005). Although it is unclear if ABCC6 has a unique
function distributed in multiple tissues or tissue-specific roles, its
deficiency was first and foremost linked to calcification activation
in PXE, β-thalassemia, and GACI in humans and DCC in mice.
As off today, only two studies point to the liver as the tissue with
the most relevance with respect to the calcification phenotype
(Martin et al., 2011; Brampton et al., 2012).
PSEUDOXANTHOMA ELASTICUM
PXE (MIM 264800) is a recessive disease affecting the connective tissue and is defined by the calcification and fragmentation
of elastic fibers (Chassaing et al., 2005). The PXE clinical signs
primarily involve the skin, the Bruch’s membrane of the eyes and
cardiovascular system resulting in skin sagging and redundancy,
visual impairment caused by retinal hemorrhages and peripheral
arterial disease (PAD) associated with gastrointestinal bleeding
and intermittent claudication. The localization of the transmembrane ABCC6 protein into the basolateral plasma membrane of
hepatocytes and proximal kidney tubules cells is very relevant to
its physiological function. It is its inability to secrete its unknown
substrate toward the circulation that is the most likely cause of
the ectopic calcification in PXE, which describes this disease as
metabolic rather than a connective tissue disease.
β-THALASSEMIA
The second calcification phenotype linked to ABCC6 is in fact
a phenocopy of PXE. β-thalassemia (MIM 141900) is a monogenic disorder caused by mutations in the β-globin gene that
leads to the underproduction of β-globin chains. The stoichiometric excess of α-chains unbound to β-globin is unstable and
precipitate in red blood cell precursors forming inclusion bodies. These are responsible for the intramedullary destruction
of the erythroid precursors and the ineffective erythropoiesis
Frontiers in Genetics | Systems Biology December 2012 | Volume 3 | Article 289 | 4

Le Saux et al. ABCC6 molecular and physiological roles
that characterize the β-thalassemias. Ineffective erythropoeisis
in thalassemia major and certain intermedia patients results in
considerable marrow expansion causing bone deformities and
iron overload that is further exacerbated by frequent blood
transfusions (Thein, 1998). The β-thalassemias are widespread
throughout the Mediterranean, Africa, the Middle East, the
Indian subcontinent, and Southeast Asia. In the past decade, it has
become apparent that a large number of Mediterranean patients
affected by β-thalassemia or sickle cell anemia also develop manifestations similar to PXE (Aessopos et al., 2002). β-thalassemia
and PXE are distinct genetic disorders yet, the ectopic mineralization phenotype of seen in β-thalassemia patients is clinically
and structurally identical to inherited PXE (Baccarani-Contri
et al., 2001; Cianciulli et al., 2002; Farmakis et al., 2003, 2004).
As we have established that the PXE-like mineralization in
β-thalassemia patients arises independently of ABCC6 mutations (Hamlin et al., 2003), we hypothesized that the expression of the ABCC6 gene or the biological properties of its
product could be disrupted in liver and/or kidneys as a secondary consequence of the hemoglobinopathy. We have tested
this possibility by following the synthesis of ABCC6 in the
liver and kidneys of a β-thalassemia mouse model (Hbbth3/+).
We found a progressive liver-specific downregulation in the
Abcc6 gene expression and the corresponding protein levels.
This downregulation became significant at 6 months of age and
stabilized at older ages at ∼25% of the wild type protein levels. Studying the transcriptional regulation of the Abcc6 gene
revealed that the main cause of the downregulation resided
with the absence of a single transcription factor, the erythroidspecific NF-E2 from the Abcc6 promoter. Coincidentally, NF-E2
is a major transcription factor for the expression of several
hemoglobin-related genes (Andrews, 1998). Hbbth3/+mice did
not develop spontaneous calcification as seen in Abcc6−/− mice
probably because the ABCC6 protein decrease occurred late in
life and/or was insufficient to promote mineralization in the
Hbbth3/+ mouse with the DCC-resistant C57BL/6J genetic background (Martin et al., 2011). Nevertheless, as the transcriptional
regulation of the mouse and human ABCC6 genes is similar (Aranyi et al., 2005; Douet et al., 2006, 2007; de Boussac
et al., 2010; Ratajewski et al., 2012), it is likely that the human
β-thalassemia phenotype could induce comparable molecular
changes leading to a suboptimal endowment in ABCC6 and
increased susceptibility to ectopic mineralization in a PXE-like
manner.
GENERALIZED ARTERIAL CALCIFICATION OF INFANCY
The third disease related to the ABCC6 deficiency is GACI, a
rare autosomal-recessive disorder characterized by severe pathologic calcifications in the arterial media with intimal proliferation
leading to vascular occlusion. GACI is associated with biallelic
mutations in ENPP1 and affected patients suffer from hypertension, severe myocardial ischemia and congestive heart failure.
Most affected patients die within the first 6 months of life. The
obvious overlapping mineralization phenotype between GACI
and PXE led to a recent study that correlated the phenotype
to genotype in GACI and PXE patients (Nitschke et al., 2012).
This work found clinical manifestations unique to PXE in GACI
patients carrying ENPP1 mutations including angioid streaks
and identical skin lesions. Additionally, mutations in ABCC6
accounted for a significant subset of GACI patients where no
ENPP1 mutation was found. The authors concluded that PXE
and GACI are in fact diseases with overlapping characteristics
reflecting a spectrum of severity in ectopic calcification rather
than two distinct entities (Nitschke et al., 2012). However, the
clear resemblances between the GACI and PXE phenotypes rather
suggests an underlying convergence of ENPP1 and ABCC6 molecular pathways toward a common inhibition of mineralization
somewhere upstream of the phenotypic manifestations, i.e., calcification because ENPP1 deficiency leads to elastic fiber alterations
typical of PXE in the vasculature, the skin, and ocular tissues
(Figure 2A).
A somewhat similar convergence exists between the PXElike syndrome in which GGCX mutations lead to insufficient
MGP carboxylation (activation) and the classic inherited PXE
(Gheduzzi et al., 2007; Vanakker et al., 2010). Unlike the
PXE/GACI connection, the similarities between PXE and GGCXassociated syndrome represent a convergence of phenotypes
rather than merging pathways (Figure 2B). The similarities are
probably only due to the involvement of MGP deficiencies in
both diseases. The patterns of elastic fiber mineralization are
structurally different and the clinical evolution of the PXE-like
syndrome diverges from PXE notably with a much greater laxity of the skin (Vanakker et al., 2007). A similar paradigm exists
for other diseases such as cutis laxa, which can be either inherited through mutations in several genes related to elastic fibers or
acquired through other processes affecting the structural integrity
of these elastic fibers (Berk et al., 2012).
THE MURINE DYSTROPHIC CARDIAC CALCIFICATION
DCC
In recent years, two groups of investigators have established that
ABCC6 deficiency is linked to an acute dystrophic calcification
phenotype affecting the myocardium of several inbred strains
of mice, including C3H/HeJ, 129S1/SvJ, and DBA/2J (Doehring
et al., 2006; Meng et al., 2007; Aherrahrou et al., 2008). This
murine phenotype is designated DCC. It is an autosomal recessive trait that was described several decades ago in animal models
(Eaton et al., 1978; Everitt et al., 1988). It corresponds to a
condition affecting cardiac tissues that can either occur spontaneously over the long-term or be initiated by specific dietary
regime. Importantly, DCC can develop into an acute phenotype if triggered by a severe injury including surface freeze-thaw
injuries (Ivandic et al., 2001; Aherrahrou et al., 2004) or ischemia
(Brampton et al., 2012). In addition to cardiac tissues, the vasculature, notably the aortic artery (SMCs) as well as skeletal muscles,
are also susceptible to developing calcification in response to the
same type of severe injuries (Brunnert, 1997; Doehring et al.,
2006). The major locus controlling this trait was first mapped
to chromosome 7 (Ivandic et al., 2001) and subsequently was
linked to a single Abcc6 gene mutation in C3H/HeJ mice that
leads to a large constitutive decrease in ABCC6 protein levels in
the liver (Aherrahrou et al., 2008). The same mutation is present
in 129S1/SvJ and DBA/2J mouse strains while it is absent in
C57BL/6J mice that are DCC-resistant. There are three additional

minor loci affecting the penetrance and the expression of the
DCC phenotype that were mapped to chromosomes 4, 12, and
14 (Ivandic et al., 2001), though no specific genes have been
identified as yet.
DCC-susceptible C3H/HeJ mice develop an attenuated version
of the murine PXE phenotype as compared to the Abcc6−/− animals, while the DBA/2J mice present little or no manifestations
(Smolen et al., 2012). It is interesting to note that the murine PXE
manifestations recently reported in KK/H1J mice are remarkably severe and somewhat more extended than those of the
Abcc6−/− mice (Li et al., 2012). More interesting is that all
these strains of mice carry the exact same Abcc6 gene mutation,
which clearly underlines the influence of the genetic background
in dystrophic calcification and thus the synergistic convergence
of multiple gene-encoded pathways toward a common endresult that is the pathological mineralization of soft tissues
(Figures 1 and 2).
In a study that we have now submitted for publication,
we specifically explored the role of ABCC6 in the calcification
response to cardiovascular insults. We used two different models of infarction, the non-ischemic freeze-thaw (cryoinjury) and
coronary artery ligation. We first confirmed the propensity to
cardiac mineralization of Abcc6−/− mice backcrossed into the
DCC-resistant C57BL/6J background and thus the primordial
role of ABCC6 in acute calcification. Furthermore, we have successfully modulated the calcification response to cryoinjury by
varying the expression levels of ABCC6, either using heterozygous Abcc6+/− mice or the transient expression of the human
ABCC6 protein in the liver of Abcc6-null mice. Moreover, the
levels of ABCC6 correlated with the amount and distribution of
the regulators of mineralization osteopontin (OPN) and MGP
but not osteocalcin (OC) clearly indicating that ABCC6 regulates
cardiac calcification in conjunction with the local regulators of
mineralization (Brampton et al., 2012).
Mitochondrial calcification
In 1997, Brunnert reported for the first time the precipitation
of amorphous calcium within and around swollen mitochondria, a few hours after myocardial damage in the DCC-susceptible
C3H/HeJ and DBA/2J mice. Subsequently, these electron-dense
calcium deposits grew larger encompassing the entire cytoplasm
and eventually the surrounding myofibrils (Brunnert, 1997).
These findings prompted the author to hypothesize that dystrophic calcification may actually result from altered mitochondrial function. A suggestion that the recent report from Martin
et al. has partially corroborated by showing that mitochondria in cardiac, liver, and renal tissues of Abcc6−/− mice were
structurally altered and presented decreased respiratory capacities (Martin et al., 2012). Later, one of us (Aherrahrou, Z.) as
well as others confirmed the formation of hydroxyapatite in cardiomyocytes mitochondria of C3H/HeJ mice (Aherrahrou, 2003).
And interestingly, hydroxyapatite crystals in the mitochondria
of cardiomyocytes were present equally in both C3H/HeJ mice
and the DCC-resistant C57BL/6 animals in the first 24 h after
cardiac injury. That changed in the following days when the
growth of calcium crystal continued to spread in the C3H/HeJ
mice while it subsided in C57BL/6J (Aherrahrou, 2003). These
data suggested that in both strains, the mitochondria were first
be able to sequester and concentrate calcium salts beyond solubility in the injured cells. And indeed, the key role that the
ATP-dependent mitochondrial calcium sequestration exerts on
intracellular calcium stores during cell death processes has largely

Le Saux et al. ABCC6 molecular and physiological roles
been documented (Chakraborti et al., 1999; Raha and Robinson,
2001). However, the runaway formation of hydroxyapatite crystals in C3H/HeJ mice, which also requires the involvement of
phosphate ions, appears to be linked to an ABCC6-dependent
deficiency of a calcification inhibition from within the mitochondria. It is unclear what this calcification inhibition might
be and whether the rapid progression of crystal formation
in C3H/HeJ mice is connected to the abnormal respiration
function of mitochondrial as noted by Martin et al. (2012).
Though, one would wonder if vitamin K2, which has recently
been described as an electron carrier in mitochondria (Vos
et al., 2012), participates in this acute calcification phenotype
especially in the light of the large discrepancy we previously
described in the levels of circulating vitamin K1 and K2 between
Abcc6−/−mice and C57BL/6J controls animals fed an enriched
diet (Brampton et al., 2011).
DCC vs. PXE
One must distinguish the fundamental differences that exist
between the induced calcification phenotype of DCC mice and
the mineralization seen in the prototypic PXE disease. The latter phenotype is characterized by a long-term chronic and passive
development of calcification that primarily affects the extracellular matrix (elastic fibers) over a period of time counted in years
for humans and in months for mice. In contrast, the DCC phenotype is acute when induced and develops over a very short
period of no more than 72 h, seemingly affecting only non-elastic
muscular tissues. Moreover, the induced DCC calcification is
intracellular, occurring within mitochondria. Both chronic and
acute molecular pathways leading to calcification share the same
molecular origin, i.e., ABCC6 deficiency. However, their mechanism of initiation and progression are clearly different which
indicate that ABCC6 signaling (from the liver) has much broader
ramifications toward a variety of cellular and molecular processes than we originally thought. Of note, the DCC phenotype
has not (yet) been described in human PXE patients, though
cardiac calcification occurring within cardiomyocytes mitochondria is not uncommon after severe myocardial damages following
an ischemic event (Bloom and Peric-Golia, 1989; Lockard and
Bloom, 1991).
VITAMIN K AND MGP-DEPENDENT INHIBITION OF CALCIFICATION
As discussed above, vitamin K or one of its derivatives is not
a substrate transported by ABCC6, though the depleted levels
of circulating vitamin K in PXE patients was thought to have a
direct consequence in the carboxylation (activation) status of the
calcification inhibitor MGP and the susceptibility to chronic calcification in PXE (Gheduzzi et al., 2007; Vanakker et al., 2007,
2010). We have shown that increasing the availability of vitamin K1 or K2 in peripheral tissues of Abcc6−/− mice did not
significantly affect the MGP carboxylation status in the calcified
capsule of vibrissae (Brampton et al., 2011). And going further,
Boraldi et al. (2012) have now established that dermal fibroblasts
isolated from PXE patients were able to uptake and use vitamin K1 or K2 for overall protein carboxylation as efficiently as
healthy fibroblasts but not for MGP, which remained specifically
undercarboxylated. As described above, we found that variable
ABCC6 expression levels in the liver modulated the amounts of
undercarboxylated MGP in calcified cardiac tissues (Brampton
et al., 2012). Taken together these results suggested that MGP
or the regulation of its carboxylation process and possibly OPN
correlate with ABCC6 signaling and/or the ectopic calcification
status.
ABCC6 AS A PHENOTYPE MODIFIER GENE
Infarct size
A recent study by Mungrue et al. (2011) suggested a relationship between ABCC6 function and infarct size under short-term
ischemia reperfusion conditions (under an hour). In their studies, the authors noted the absence of any calcification in the
myocardium of Abcc6-null mice suggesting that only a sustained
cardiac injury lead to significant tissue necrosis and calcification
in the absence of ABCC6 function (Figure 1).
Susceptibility to common artery diseases
The independent report by Köblös et al. as well as Trip and coworkers have both suggested that human heterozygous carriers
of ABCC6 mutations are more likely to develop complications
resulting from cardiovascular incidents than the general population (Trip et al., 2002; Koblos et al., 2010). However, this is not
without controversy as a much larger study based on 66,831 individuals has found no risk for ischemic heart diseases associated
with the ABCC6 p.R1141X mutation (Hornstrup et al., 2011).
Stroke is also a vascular-related condition frequently reported in
PXE patients (Aessopos et al., 1997; van den Berg et al., 2000)
but it could well be that strokes etiology in certain PXE individuals might not be related to ABCC6 deficiency as Hornstrup et al.
could not statistically link cerebrovascular diseases with the most
frequent ABCC6 mutation (p.R1141X). The occurrence of PAD
in PXE (Figure 1) is less contentious as its precise characteristics
are being carefully studied in a French cohort (Leftheriotis et al.,
2011a). For more details on the prevalence and the peculiar presentation of PAD in PXE, see the review of Leftheriotis et al. in
this issue.
CONCLUDING REMARKS
For many years, ABCC6 was considered to have little more relevance than the causative gene for a rare heritable disease, PXE.
However, we and others have now assembled a large body of
data that clearly demonstrates that ABCC6 is far more important
for cardiovascular health, in aging, and multiple diseased states
than was initially thought. ABCC6 deficiency not only increases
directly the susceptibility to connective tissue (elastic fibers) calcification in PXE, it also contributes to and aggravates the pathology of a significant fraction of GACI and β-thalassemia patients.
This protein is the root-cause of an acute mineralization phenotype that when triggered dramatically affects the intracellular calcium homeostasis in muscle tissues. ABCC6 is now a fully fledged
inhibitor of calcification that works at a systemic level (through
the circulation) as part of a larger ensemble of local and general regulators of calcification. But, the loss of ABCC6 function
also leads to various physiological changes other than calcification
that we have only begun to describe and undoubtedly, more is
yet to come.
