Everolimus Plus Ku0063794 Regimen Promotes Anticancer Effects
against Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells through the
Paradoxical Inhibition of Autophagy
Original Article
Purpose
Everolimus only inhibits mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), whereas
Ku0063794 inhibits both mTORC1 and mTORC2. Although they have similar anticancer
effects, their combination has a synergistic effect against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
cells. We aimed to determine the mechanism underlying the synergistic effects of
everolimus and Ku0063794 associated with autophagy in HCC cells.
Materials and Methods
We compared the effects of everolimus and Ku0063794, individually or in combination, on
both the in vitro and in vivo models of HCCs.
Results
HepG2 cells treated with both agents had significantly lower rates of cell proliferation and
higher apoptosis than the individual monotherapies (p < 0.05). Autophagic studies consistently indicated that, unlike the monotherapies, the combination therapy significantly
reduced autophagy (p < 0.05). Autophagic blockage directly promoted the pro-apoptotic
effects of combination therapy, suggesting autophagy as the survival mechanism of HCC
cells. Unlike the monotherapies, combination therapy showed the potential to inhibit sirtuin
1 (SIRT1), the positive regulator of autophagy. SIRT1 overexpression abrogated the
autophagy-inhibiting and pro-apoptotic effects of combination therapy. In a nude mouse
xenograft model, the shrinkage of tumors was more prominent in mice treated with combination therapy than in mice treated with the respective monotherapies (p < 0.05). The
immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence stains of the tumor obtained from the
xenograft model showed that combination therapy had the potential of reducing autophagy
and promoting apoptosis.
Conclusion
The combination of everolimus and Ku0063794 potentiates anticancer effects on HCCs
through a decrease in autophagy, which is prompted by SIRT1 downregulation.

Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cancer causing death worldwide with a 5-year survival rate of
10%, leading to 250,000 to 1,000,000 deaths per year [1,2].
Aberrant mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling
has been detected in up to 48% of HCC patients, and correlates with poor prognosis [3]. In mTOR signaling, the proliferation signal is passed to two sets of effector molecules: Akt
(a mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 [mTORC1]
downstream molecule), and S6K1 and 4EBP1 (mTORC2
downstream molecules) [4,5]. It was reported that everolimus, an mTORC1 inhibitor, failed to provide more signifi-

Cancer Res Treat. 2018;50(3):1023-1038
cant anticancer effects against HCC compared to other
chemotherapeutic agents [6,7]. One plausible explanation for
this phenomenon is that everolimus only inhibits mTORC1,
thereby allowing proliferative signaling via mTORC2 [5];
uninhibited mTORC2 signaling might interfere with the
anticancer effects of everolimus by allowing Akt activation,
which has been consistently inhibited by mTORC2. However, we previously found that the similar anti-HCC effects
had been obtained by the regimens blocking either mTORC1
(everolimus) or mTORC2 (Ku0063794) [8]. Moreover, we
unexpectedly detected that combining everolimus with
Ku0063794 exhibited a synergistic anticancer effect in HCC
cells.
Since autophagy essentially involves cell survival, effects
on autophagy should be considered when determining the
efficacy of antitumor agents. Autophagy is a specialized
intracellular process for degrading and recycling cellular
macromolecules to maintain cellular homeostasis [9,10]. It
can contribute to cell survival or death, depending on its
level of activity; an appropriate level of autophagic activity
protects cells by recycling intracellular macromolecules or
organelles, whereas excessive autophagy may lead to cell
damage, ultimately causing cell death [11]. mTOR signaling
is known to control the autophagic machinery [10,12]. Under
unstimulated conditions, autophagy is consistently inhibited
by mTOR signaling; however, blocking of mTOR signaling,
possibly by starvation or the treatment with an mTOR
inhibitor, can trigger autophagy [13].
Recent studies have indicated that sirutuin 1 (SIRT1) is a
key player in the autophagic process [14,15]. SIRT1 belongs
to the histone deacetylase class III family [16,17]. They are
involved in the post-translational modification of translated
proteins. SIRT1-mediated autophagy essentially involves cell
proliferation, metabolism, and resistance to stress [14,18,19].
SIRT1 can promote autophagy by deacetylating not only
essential autophagy-related proteins, such as Atg5, Atg7, and
Atg8, but also numerous transcription factors, including p53,
nuclear factor B, FoxO3, E2F1, histone H4, FoxO1, S6K, and
tuberous sclerosis complex 2 [15,18]. Subsequently, after
deacetylation, these transcription factors can activate autophagy-related genes. We previously demonstrated that,
unlike individual monotherapy which failed to inhibit SIRT1
expression, combining everolimus with Ku0063794 significantly inhibited SIRT1 expression in a dose-dependent manner [8]. In this further study, we investigated the effects of
everolimus and Ku0063794, individually or in combination,
on autophagy. Subsequently, we attempted to determine the
mechanism of their synergistic combination therapy effect in
relation to SIRT1-mediated autophagy in HCC cells. Subsequently, we attempted to determine the mechanism by
which the synergistic combination therapy effect acts in
relation to SIRT1-mediated autophagy in HCC cells.
Materials and Methods
1. Chemicals and reagents
Everolimus and Ku0063794 were obtained from Selleckem
(Houston, TX). Bafilomycin A1, monodansylcadaverine
(MDC) and acridine orange were purchased from SigmaAldrich (St. Louis, MO). pcDNA and pcDNA-sirtus1 (SIRT1)
were obtained from Addgene (Cambridge, MA). Lipofectamine 2000 was purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA).
2. Cell culture
The HepG2 HCC cell lines were obtained from KCLB
(Korean Cell Line Bank, Seoul, Korea). HepG2 cells were
maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumhigh
glucose medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA).
The medium was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(GibcoBRL, Carlsbad, CA) and 1% antibiotics (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2
in an incubator.
3. Cell proliferation assay
Cell proliferation was evaluated with a 2-(4-iodophenyl)-
3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium
(water soluble tetrazolium salt, WST-1) assay using the
EZ-Cytox Cell Proliferation Assay kit (Itsbio, Seoul, Korea)
according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Briefly, HepG2
cells were plated in 96-well plates and cultured overnight
(1104 cells per well). The cells were treated with everolimus
and Ku0063794 at different concentrations (100, 250, 500,
1,000, and 2,000 nM) for 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours,
respectively. The reagent provided in the EZ-Cytox Cell Proliferation Assay kit was then added to each well. Absorbance
was measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader (model
680, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).
4. Western blot analysis
HepG2 cells and liver tissues were lysed using the EzRIPA
Lysis kit (ATTO Corp., Tokyo, Japan), and quantified using
Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Proteins were visualized by
western analysis using incubations in the following primary
antibodies (1:1,000 dilution) at 4°C overnight and in horseradish peroxidase (HRP)conjugated secondary antibodies
(1:2,000 dilution) for 1 hour at 25°C. Primary antibodies
included antibodies against p-mTORSer2448
, p-p70S6K, LC3-
phosphatidylethanolamine conjugate (LC3B), p62, B-cell
lymphoma-extra large (Bcl-xL), cleaved poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase (c-PARP), cleaved caspase-3 (c-caspase 3),

cleaved caspase-9 (c-caspase 9), myeloid cell leukemia-1
(Mcl-1), Bcl-2 like protein 11 (Bim), SIRT1, and -actin (all
from Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA). The secondary antibodies were HRP-conjugated (Cell Signaling Technology). Specific immune complexes were detected using the
Western Blotting Plus Chemiluminescence Reagent (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The Band Analysis tools of ImageLab
software (Bio-Rad) were used to determine the density of the
bands in all blots. -Actin was used as normalization control.
5. Acridine orange and MDC staining
HepG2 cells were cultured on Lab-Tek chamber slides
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Hemel Hempstead, UK) and were
given an IRI conditioning with or without 100 nM everolimus for 5 hours. Subsequently, HepG2 cells were stained
with either 1 µg/mL acridine orange or with 0.05 mM MDC
at 37°C for 30 minutes, respectively. The autophagic vesicular organelles were observed using a confocal laser scanning
microscope (LSM5 Live, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).
6. Detection of GFP-LC3B punta formation
Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-LC3 (Addgene) was transiently transfected into HepG2 cells with Lipofectamine 2000
transfection reagent (Invitrogen). The cells were then treated
with and without 100 nM everolimus and 1 µM Ku0063794
for 24 hours and were observed using a confocal laser scanning microscope. To quantify autophagy, the number of cells
with punctate GFP-LC3 was counted.
7. Overexpression of SIRT1 genes
HepG2 cells were plated in 6-well plates (2105 cells/well)
and transiently transfected with 1 µg pcDNA-SIRT1 (Addgene) per well mixed with the Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
After incubation for 5 hours, the medium was changed to
complete culture medium, and the cells were incubated at
37°C in a CO2 incubator for 48 hours before harvesting.
8. In vivo xenograft model
BALB/c nude mice (6-week-old) were used for comparative modeling of subcutaneous tumor growth. HepG2 cells
(5106
) were subcutaneously injected into each mouse. The
mice were weighed twice a week. Fourteen days after tumor
cell injection, all mice had measurable tumors. Mice were
then randomly grouped (n=5 per group) and treated
intraperitoneally with normal saline (control), everolimus
(0.5 mg/kg in 100 µL normal saline, 3 times a week), Ku00-
63794 (1 mg/kg in 100 µL in normal saline, 3 times a week),
and a combination of both agents (0.5 mg/kg everolimus
combined with 1 mg/kg Ku0063794 in 100 µL normal saline,
3 times a week) for 28 days. Tumor size was measured twice
weekly via caliper, and tumor volume was calculated using
the formula lengthwidth2
0.5236 [20]. After the completion
of treatment, all mice were euthanized.
9. Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical analyses
For immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical
analysis, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections
were deparaffinized, rehydrated in an ethanol series and
subjected to epitope retrieval using standard procedures.
Antibodies to c-caspase 3 and cytosolic LC3B were used for
immunofluorescence, and antibodies to c-caspase 3 and
SIRT1 were used for immunohistochemical stains. The samples were then examined under a laser-scanning microscope
(Eclipse TE300, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) to analyze the expression of c-caspase 3 and LC3B.
10. Statistical analysis
All data were analyzed using SPSS ver. 11.0 software (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL) and are presented as the mean±standard
deviation (SD). Statistical comparisons between the mean
values of the two groups were performed using the MannWhitney U test. p-values of < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
11. Ethical statement
This animal study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Clinical Research Institute at Daejeon St. Mary’s Hospital at the Catholic University
of Korea (institutional review board #CMCDJ-AP-2015-006).

nM) and Ku0063794 (1 µM) determined in this experiment.
We then investigated the effects of everolimus and
Ku0063794, singly or in combination, on the expression of
mTOR downstream molecules. Higher concentrations of singly
administered everolimus and Ku0063794 tended to reduce the
expression of p-mTOR and p-p70S6K (Fig. 2A and B). By contrast, combining both agents facilitated the synergistic
mTOR-inhibiting capability, as demonstrated by stronger
dose-dependent inhibition of p-mTOR and p-p70S6K
(Fig. 2C). Fig. 2D represents the expression of mTOR downstream molecules at the concentrations of everolimus (100

2. Effects of everolimus and Ku0063794 on cell apoptosis of
HepG2 cells
Next, we determined the expression of markers reflecting
pro-apoptosis (c-PARP and c-caspase 3) and anti-apoptosis
(Mcl-1) depending on mono- or combination regimens
(Fig. 3A). Western blot analysis revealed that each monotherapy promoted the pro-apoptotic effect, as demonstrated by
the elevation of c-PARP and c-caspase 3 and the reduction of
Mcl-1. The combination therapy appeared to potentiate the
pro-apoptotic effects of individual monotherapies, as demonstrated by the more prominent up- and down-regulation of
these markers, mostly in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.05).
Fig. 3B represents the expression of the markers related to

of everolimus (100 nM) and Ku0063794 (1 µM) determined
in this experiment.
Flow cytometric analysis also revealed that the number of
annexin Vpositive cells (early and late apoptotic cells) was
significantly higher in HepG2 cells treated with combination
therapy compared to cells treated with the monotherapies
(p < 0.05) (Fig. 2C).
3. Effects of everolimus and Ku0063794 on autophagy of
HepG2 cells
Autophagy is a key mechanism that regulates cell survival
or death [9,21,22]. Thus, to understand the basis of synergistic potentiation by combination therapy, we investigated the
effects of each therapy on autophagy. Western blot analyses
showed that everolimus or Ku0063794 monotherapies
increased autophagy, as evidenced by the dose-dependent
higher expression of LC3B and the lower expression of p62.
However, paradoxically, combination therapy decreased
autophagy, as evidenced by the lower expression of LC3B
and the higher expression of p62 (p < 0.05) (Fig. 4A and B).
We further validated the effects of the individual therapies
on autophagy in HepG2 cells using MDC staining, acridine
orange staining, and GFP-LC3 puncta-formation assays
(Fig. 3C). The results consistently showed that, although the
individual monotherapies increased the formation of
autophagic vacuoles (positive MDC, acridine orange staining, and GFP-LC3 puncta-positive cells), the combination
therapy significantly decreased their formation, indicating a
reduction in autophagy (p < 0.05).
To determine the role of autophagy, the expression of
apoptosis-associated markers was investigated after pharmacological blockage of autophagy using bafilomycin A1
(Fig. 4D). Western blot analysis verified successful autoCancer Res Treat. 2018;50(3):1023-1038

phagic blockage by bafilomycin A1, as demonstrated by
higher expression levels of LC3B and p63. Autophagic blockage directly promoted the pro-apoptotic effects of combination therapy, as demonstrated by the higher expression of
pro-apoptotic proteins (c-PARP, c-caspase 3, and Bim) and
the lower expression of anti-apoptotic proteins (Mcl-1 and
Bcl-xL). These results suggest that combination therapy promoted the apoptosis of HCC cells by downregulating autophagy, the essential survival mechanism of HCC cells.
4. SIRT1 overexpression assay to determine the effects of
combination therapy depending on SIRT1 expression
SIRT1 regulates a variety of physiological processes
including autophagy, stress responses, metabolism, apoptosis, and aging [23]. We found that, although individual
monotherapies failed to inhibit SIRT1 expression, the combined use of everolimus or Ku0063794 had the potential to
inhibit SIRT1 expression (Fig. 5A). To determine the role of
SIRT1 in relation with autophagy more precisely, we generated SIRT1-overexpressing HepG2 cells. Western blot analysis showed the successful generation of SIRT1-overexpressing HepG2 cells, which had been established by transfection with pcDNA-SIRT1 (Fig. 5B). We also found that
transfection with pcDNA-SIRT1 promoted autophagy, as
demonstrated by the higher expression of LC3B and the
lower expression of p62.
Subsequently, we investigated the effects of SIRT1 overexpression on the autophagy-inhibiting and pro-apoptotic
potentials of combination therapy (Fig. 5C). Overexpression
of SIRT1 abrogated the autophagy-inhibiting potential of
combination therapy, which was manifested by the higher
expression of LC3B and the lower expression of p62. SIRT1
overexpression also abrogated the pro-apoptotic potential of
combination therapy, which was manifested by lower
expression of pro-apoptotic proteins (c-PARP, c-caspase-3,
and Bim) and higher expression of Mcl-1. Taken altogether,
we conclude that the combined use of everolimus and
Ku0063794 suppressed autophagy and promoted the apoptosis of HepG2 cells by downregulating SIRT1 expression.

in each group. The levels of autophagy correlate with numbers of MDC-positive cells, acridine orange-positive cells, and

5. Effects of everolimus, Ku0063794, and their combination
on the growth of HepG2 xenograft tumors
We examined the potential of everolimus and Ku0063794,
individually or in combination, to inhibit the growth of
HepG2 cells in the nude mouse tumor xenograft model. After
everolimus (0.5 mg/kg/day) and Ku0063794 (1 mg/kg/day)
had been administered intraperitoneally every day for 3
weeks, the mice were euthanized and the tumors were collected. Images of the tumors before and after necropsy
showed that tumor shrinkage was more prominent in mice
treated with combination therapy than in mice treated with
individual monotherapies (Fig. 6A). In addition, there was a
greater reduction in tumor weight in the mice treated with
combination therapy than in those treated with individual
monotherapies (p < 0.05).
Finally, we performed histological and molecular investigations of the tumor cell mass obtained from the xenograft
model. Immunohistochemical staining of SIRT1 and c-caspase 3 revealed that the combination group exhibited a
marked reduction in SIRT1 and an increase in c-caspase 3
(Fig. 6B). Subsequently, immunofluorescence of LC3B and
c-caspase 3 revealed that combination therapy resulted in a
significant reduction of LC3B and a significant increase in
c-caspase 3 (p < 0.05) (Fig. 6C). Taken altogether, the data
presented here demonstrated the pro-apoptotic, SIRT1-
inhibiting, and autophagic inhibiting potentials of combination therapy in tumor tissues obtained from the xenograft
model.
Discussion
We previously reported that combined treatment with
everolimus and Ku0063794 resulted in the synergistic
enhancement of pro-apoptotic effect against HCC cells [8].
In this study, we identified the mechanism of this synergistic
effect in relation to autophagy. We found that whereas individual monotherapies increased autophagy, the combined
use of everolimus and Ku0063794 paradoxically decreased
autophagy in HCC cells. Autophagic blockade directly promoted the pro-apoptotic effects of combination therapy,
identifying autophagy as a survival mechanism in HCC cells.
Furthermore, unlike monotherapies, combination therapy
showed the potential to inhibit SIRT1, which is known to
promote autophagy. Taken together, these data suggest that
the combination of everolimus and Ku0063794 potentiates
anticancer effects on HCCs through a decrease in autophagy,
which is prompted by SIRT1 downregulation.
Autophagy induces cell survival or death, depending on
the levels of cellular stress [21]. Our study showed that the
reduction in autophagy following combination therapy led
to an increase in apoptosis in HCC cells. Treating HepG2
cells with bafilomycin A1 (an autophagy inhibitor) potentiated the pro-apoptotic effects of combination therapy. This
suggests that autophagy functions as a survival mechanism
in the HCC cells used in our experiment. Thus, anti-HCC
strategies would be directed towards greater autophagy
inhibition, the pro-survival mechanism of cancer cells. A

good example is a regimen used to treat colorectal cancer that
combines oxaliplatin with an autophagy inhibitor, such as
chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine [24,25]. In this regimen,
the autophagy inhibitor potentiates the anticancer effects of
oxaliplatin, possibly by inhibiting the pro-survival mechanism of autophagy. Likewise, our experiments revealed that
the combined use of everolimus and Ku0063794 promoted
anticancer effects against HCC cells by downregulating
autophagy.
We found that combining everolimus and Ku0063794
decreased autophagy, as evidenced by the lower expression
of LC3B and the higher expression of p62. Since mTOR signaling inhibits autophagy, mTOR inhibitors have proautophagic properties. The autophagy initiation step is
mediated by ULK1 complex, which is composed of ULK1/
ULK2, Atg13, and FIP200 [12,26]. mTOR signaling tightly
regulates this ULK1 complex [10]. mTORC1 inhibits
autophagy by direct phosphorylation of Atg13 and ULK1 at
S757 under nutrient-rich conditions. However, nutrientdeficient conditions or an mTOR inhibitor can lead to a separation of mTOR and ULK1 complex, resulting in the
dephosphorylation of Atg13 and ULK1. This again leads to
dephosphorylation-mediated activation of ULK1 (and
ULK2), and ULK1-mediated phosphorylation of Atg13,
FIP200, and ULK1 itself, which elicits autophagy [27,28]. In
keeping with the literature, our study showed that autophagy of HCC cells was promoted by everolimus or Ku00-
63794 monotherapy. However, autophagy was decreased by
combining both agents. To explain this phenomenon, we
investigated the expression of SIRT1 which is known to be

essential for the autophagic process.
In our study, combination therapy appeared to decrease
autophagy by decreasing SIRT1, thereby promoting anticancer effects. A number of studies have validated that SIRT1
promotes autophagy [14,15]. Of them, Lee et al. [19] reported
that SIRT1 formed molecular complexes with essential autophagy-related proteins, such as Atg5, Atg7, and Atg8, and
thus promoted autophagy by deacetylating these proteins.
In addition, the absence of SIRT1 caused autophagy impairment, followed by increased levels of SQSTM1/p62 and
inhibition of autophagosome formation. Likewise, they also
showed that, as with Atg5–/– mice, SIRT1–/– mice exhibited
deficiencies in energy metabolism as well as the accumulation of damaged organelles. Their results suggest that SIRT1
promotes autophagy at the level of post-translational processing. In this study, we showed that, although individual
monotherapies failed to inhibit SIRT1 expression, the combined use of everolimus or Ku0063794 had the potential of
inhibiting SIRT1 expression. We also showed that combination therapy promoted the apoptosis of HCC cells by downregulating autophagy, the essential survival mechanism in
HCC cells. Since the effect of SIRT1 on raising autophagy has
been validated, we could conclude that combination therapy
decreased autophagy by decreasing SIRT1, thereby promoting anticancer effects.
Interestingly, we found that combining both agents abrogated the SIRT1-promoting effects of individual monotherapies. It is known that mTOR signaling suppresses SIRT1
expression [29,30]. Back et al. [29] reported that cellular stress
mTOR-dependently phosphorylated SIRT1 at serine 47,
thereby inhibiting the deacetylase activity of SIRT1. They
also showed that anticancer compounds, such as resveratrol
or doxorubicin, mTOR-dependently inhibited SIRT1 deacetylase activity in tumor cells (human squamous cell carcinoma). However, the addition of an mTOR inhibitor
(rapamycin) restored SIRT1 deacetylase activity in the presence of resveratrol, demonstrating the SIRT1-promoting
effect of the mTOR inhibitor. Their results are in line with
our study because we demonstrated that individual monotherapies or an mTOR inhibitor (everolimus or Ku0063794)
promoted the expression of SIRT1 in HCC cells. However,
combining both agents paradoxically decreased the expression of SIRT1, which needs to be further clarified.
In conclusion, we found that, unlike monotherapies, the
combined use of everolimus and Ku0063794 decreased
autophagy in HCC cells. In addition, unlike monotherapies,

combination therapy showed the potential to inhibit SIRT1,
the positive regulator of autophagy. The combination therapy thus promoted anticancer effects in HCCs by decreasing
autophagy, which was prompted by SIRT1 downregulation.
Therefore, when treating HCCs with everolimus, serious
consideration must be given to combining it with Ku0063794
as a means of improving anticancer effects by inhibiting
autophagy.
