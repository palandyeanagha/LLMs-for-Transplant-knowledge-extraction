Abstract
Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) offers an effective treatment for patients with 
complications of portal hypertension, specifically prevention of variceal rebleeding and recurrent 
or refractory ascites. TIPS reduces portal pressure and increases effective blood volume and 
cardiac output, but long-term adverse effects may include increased risk of liver failure, hepatic 
encephalopathy, and cardiac dysfunction. As such, TIPS is not indicated for primary prophylaxis of 
variceal bleeding. Critical to the success of TIPS is a dedicated, multidisciplinary team, along with 
careful patient selection and appropriate timing of the procedure; for example, in high-risk patients 
TIPS may offer clinical benefits when performed early in the disease course. Important patient 
factors to consider before performing TIPS include cardiac and renal function, severity of liver 
dysfunction, history of hepatic encephalopathy, and inflammatory status. Recent studies indicate that 
technical considerations, specifically diameter control and downsizing covered stents, may reduce

INTRODUCTION
Portal hypertension is the main complication of 
cirrhosis and occurs due to increased pressure 
within the portal vein(s).1 Clinically significant 
portal hypertension is defined as a hepatic 
venous pressure gradient (HVPG) >10 mmHg.2
Elevated portal pressure increases cardiac 
output and reduces systemic vascular resistance, 
increasing blood flow and leading to serious 
complications.1 These sequelae, variceal bleeding 
and refractory ascites, are associated with poor 
patient prognosis.
Treatment of portal hypertension focusses 
on preventing or managing complications 
and, at first-line, is dependent largely on 
pharmacological approaches, which include 
non-selective beta-blockers (NSBB). NSBB 
reduce cardiac output and induce splanchnic 
vasoconstriction, efficiently treating portal 
hypertension. However, there is a significant 
degree of treatment failure when NSBB are 
indicated for either primary or secondary 
prophylaxis of variceal bleeding.3,4 In addition 
to NSBB, endoscopic band ligation is 
also appropriate for secondary prophylaxis;2 
however, this therapy alone is associated with 
high rates of rebleeding compared with its use in 
combination with NSBB.5
The predominant treatments for ascites are 
diuretics or large-volume paracentesis (LVP) 
and albumin infusion. Diuretics are the first-line 
treatment and act to improve sodium balance 
and circulation;6 however, refractory ascites, 
defined as ascites that cannot be mobilised or
with early recurrence that cannot be controlled 
with medical treatment,7 develop in >10% 
of patients after initial ascites presentation.8
There are two causes of refractory ascites: 
diuretic-intractable or diuretic-resistant.8 LVP is 
mandatory if first-line therapy fails or for tense 
ascites;6 however, it is associated with recurrence 
rates as high as 89%.9 Consequently, LVP is 
frequently repeated, which places a high burden 
on patients and the healthcare system.6
For patients with variceal bleeding or ascites 
who do not respond to first-line treatment, 
transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic 
shunt (TIPS) is a well-established procedure. 
This review discusses optimisation of patient 
care and safety of covered TIPS in patients 
with portal hypertension, focussing on recent 
technical developments and considerations for 
patient selection.
TRANSJUGULAR INTRAHEPATIC 
PORTOSYSTEMIC SHUNT FOR THE 
MANAGEMENT OF COMPLICATIONS 
RELATED TO PORTAL HYPERTENSION
TIPS is a percutaneously created connection 
between the portal and hepatic veins, which 
diverts blood flow to reduce pressure between 
the portal and systemic circulations.10 Pioneered 
in 1969,11 the TIPS procedure has gained 
acceptance worldwide and is indicated for the 
treatment of portal hypertension complications. 
TIPS increases effective blood volume, an effect 
that is desirable, particularly in patients with 
refractory ascites and impaired renal function.12
Clinical contraindications for the placement of 
TIPS include severe liver and renal failure, heart 
failure, severe portopulmonary hypertension, 
recurrent or persistent overt hepatic 
encephalopathy (HE), and uncontrolled sepsis.13
Various scoring systems are used to stratify 
patients based on risk and predict post-TIPS 
survival. The model for end-stage liver disease 
(MELD) and Child–Pugh scores (CPS) were 
developed to predict mortality after shunting 
and incorporate parameters including creatinine, 
bilirubin, and albumin.14,15 The Baveno VI 
consensus considers CPS Class B patients with 
active bleeding at presentation or CPS Class C (<14)
patients as high-risk and indicated for TIPS;2
however, the recent European Association 
for the Study of the Liver (EASL) guidelines 
indicate that high-risk patient criteria require 
further study.16 Furthermore, a recent study 
has shown that CPS Class B patients who 
adverse events and increase clinical benefits of TIPS. This review focusses on the optimisation of 
the use of a covered TIPS endoprosthesis in patients with portal hypertension-related complications, 
with consideration of evolving practices, patient selection, and multidisciplinary co-operation. 
Further research and patient stratification are necessary to enhance understanding of the optimal 
use of covered TIPS and to ensure that the right patients receive TIPS at the right time.

receive standard therapy, with or without active 
bleeding, show reduced mortality in comparison 
with CPS Class C patients, suggesting TIPS may 
not be necessary for Class B patients.17 MELD 
cut-off scores, ranging between 10 and 19, are 
adopted for TIPS, with a high score indicative 
of a reduced chance of survival;9,13 although, one 
study found mortality is lower following TIPS 
compared with LVP across a series of MELD 
scores, including <10 and ≥19.9 Recently, a large 
Chinese study reported that TIPS improves 
short and long-term survival, particularly in 
patients with a high MELD score (≥19).18 Liver 
failure is reported in almost 10% of patients with 
a MELD score <12,19 indicating that there is no 
ideal cut-off score and that MELD may 
not be sufficient for excluding liver failure 
post-TIPS. Other factors, such as bilirubin levels 
<3 mg/dL and platelet count >75x109/L, may 
be superior indicators of survival and useful for 
patient selection.20
TRANSJUGULAR INTRAHEPATIC 
PORTOSYSTEMIC SHUNT 
STENT CHARACTERISTICS
The aim of TIPS is to reduce portal pressure 
enough to treat existing, and prevent further, 
complications of portal hypertension, but 
to avoid complications due to overshunting, 
such as liver dysfunction and HE. Bare stents 
have previously been used for TIPS but now 
polytetrafluorothylene-covered stent grafts are 
recommended, which reduce the risk of TIPS 
dysfunction and improve shunt patency when 
compared with bare stents.16,21
Stent diameter is one of the parameters that 
can be used to control shunting: the wider 
the shunt diameter, the greater the degree of 
shunting. While an optimal HVPG post-TIPS is 
considered <12 mmHg for variceal bleeding, 
a threshold for refractory ascites is less 
well-defined21 and low HVPG (<8  mmHg) may 
be associated with increased mortality and 
risk of complications.22,23 Evidence suggests 
8 mm stents are effective in reducing portal 
hypertension compared with medical treatment.4
While one study of 45 cirrhotic patients found 
10 mm stents to be superior to the 8 mm stent, 
this study was terminated prematurely due 
to reported side effects.24 A larger study in 
127 patients found there was a significant 
reduction in the risk of HE and liver failure with 
8 mm stents compared with 10 mm stents.25
In addition, a recent study demonstrated 
underdilation of covered stents (<8 mm) reduces 
HE in comparison with stents ≥8 mm; however, 
this study included a heterogeneous patient 
group.23 Importantly, underdilated covered 
stents have been shown to passively increase in 
diameter over time.26,27 The extent of expansion 
can vary, with reports ranging from expansion 
limited to <1 mm in diameter23 to expansion 
to nominal diameter.26 Recent research has 
indicated that the use of a novel diametercontrolled expansion stent maintains its diameter 
and improves shunt patency and MELD-serum 
sodium-based scores, as well as reducing the 
number of hospital readmissions post-TIPS, 
specifically for sepsis and ascites.28
TRANSJUGULAR INTRAHEPATIC 
PORTOSYSTEMIC SHUNT TEAMWORK
For effective TIPS delivery, a dedicated, 
multidisciplinary team is required, ideally 
consisting of a hepatologist, radiologist, 
and a transplant surgeon.13 The importance 
of experience was highlighted in a recent 
epidemiological study examining potential 
causes of post-TIPS mortality.29 This study found 
that mortality rates were associated with the 
volume of TIPS procedures performed, with 
performance of ≥20 TIPS per year reducing the 
risk of complications.29 The Baveno VI consensus 
states that high-risk patients with variceal 
bleeding should be referred for TIPS within 
72 hours of initial pharmacological/endoscopic 
treatment or when alternative treatments fail 
to manage the complications.2 Despite these 
recommendations, a recent multicentre audit 
in France reported that only 7% of 326 eligible 
patients had access to TIPS.30 Sarwar et al.29
also reported that expert centres carrying out 
≥20 TIPS per year accounted for only 38% of 
all TIPS procedures,29 highlighting that both 
accessibility and experience may be limited. 
Lack of availability of TIPS at centres means 
that timely implementation may be restricted; 
however, patient referral to a centre experienced 
in performing TIPS within a relatively short 
distance may help overcome this.30

CLINICAL EFFECTS OF TRANSJUGULAR 
INTRAHEPATIC PORTOSYSTEMIC 
SHUNT IN PATIENTS WITH 
VARICEAL BLEEDING 
When indicated for variceal bleeding, TIPS 
should be considered within three settings: 
as a rescue treatment, following failure of 
secondary prophylaxis, or as a pre-emptive 
treatment (early TIPS). 
Rescue Transjugular Intrahepatic 
Portosystemic Shunt 
Rescue or salvage TIPS refers to the treatment 
of uncontrolled or recurrent bleeding. Following 
first-line treatments, approximately 20% of 
patients with varices experience rebleeding.31
Although numerous studies have demonstrated 
that TIPS is more effective than NSBB and/or 
endoscopic treatment, previous studies have 
shown no improvement in overall survival or 
variable safety outcomes with TIPS versus 
first-line treatments.4,32-34 Such findings, along 
with the increased cost of TIPS compared with 
pharmacological treatment,33 have led to the 
use of TIPS as a rescue therapy only in cases 
of persistent or rebleeding within 5 days of 
primary prophylaxis.2,13,16,21
Failure of Secondary Prophylaxis
In the secondary prophylaxis setting, TIPS is 
only indicated following failure of appropriate 
secondary prophylaxis: combined NSBB and 
endoscopic treatments.13,16 TIPS may still be 
beneficial for secondary prophylaxis since 
studies have indicated that, despite no change 
in mortality, TIPS is superior to endoscopic and 
pharmacological treatment following failure of 
primary prophylaxis.4,32
Early Transjugular Intrahepatic 
Portosystemic Shunt 
A subset of patients show a survival benefit 
with early TIPS. Early or pre-emptive TIPS is 
conducted after acute bleeding in patients with 
a high risk of rebleeding or treatment failure.2
In these patients, including those with HVPG 
≥20 mmHg,35 TIPS performed within 24–72 hours 
of diagnosis has shown improved survival rates 
compared with pharmacological and endoscopic 
treatments.35-39 These studies are supported by 
recent meta-analyses examining the effects of 
early TIPS compared with first-line treatments, 
which showed improved mortality and 
rebleeding risks.40,41
Reported differences in survival may be due to 
selection criteria. Indeed, studies conducted in 
a heterogeneous patient group have shown no 
survival advantage,32 while studies considered 
to have a focussed patient population have 
demonstrated survival benefit.36,37 One study 
comparing early TIPS with medical and 
endoscopic treatment demonstrated an elevated 
risk of cardiac failure, as well as no survival 
benefit with TIPS.39 Again, these findings may 
be due to patient selection, which included a 
large number of CPS Class C (14–15) patients 
and patients with prior cardiovascular problems. 
This suggests that some patients may be too 
high-risk to benefit from TIPS. In addition to 
patient selection, differences in survival may 
be due to the stents used. García-Pagán et al.36
found covered stents reduced recurrent 
bleeding, and the small amount of rebleeding 
reported was mainly observed when bare stents 
were used. However, new data confirm the 
benefit to survival from early TIPS.18,42
CLINICAL EFFECTS OF TRANSJUGULAR 
INTRAHEPATIC PORTOSYSTEMIC 
SHUNT IN PATIENTS WITH ASCITES 
TIPS mobilises ascites, showing particular 
benefits in patients with refractory ascites.43
Although TIPS is more effective than LVP,44-46
it is only indicated for patients unresponsive to 
repeated (>3) LVP.6,16,21 This recommendation is 
based on studies and meta-analyses that have 
shown efficacy of TIPS but variable impact on 
survival and adverse events.9,45-47 In addition, 
patients with refractory ascites are often not 
eligible for TIPS based on contraindications and 
exclusion criteria.16
As with rebleeding, management of ascites 
is based on individual patient characteristics. 
Patients with a high frequency of LVP 
treatments should be considered for TIPS; 
LVP improves symptoms short-term but has a 
negative impact on systemic haemodynamics 
and renal function, which may be overcome 
by TIPS.6 Patients with diuretic-induced 
renal dysfunction and those that are unlikely 

6 HEPATOL SUPPL • September 2018 EMJ EUROPEAN MEDICAL JOURNAL
to respond to diuretics should also be 
considered.48 In a French multicentre study, 
patients who had not been managed longterm with LVP showed superior survival benefit 
with TIPS, as well as no increase in HE.44 In this 
specific study, the majority of patients had no 
previous history of HE, were CPS Class B, and 
aged <65 years.44
Patients with later-stage ascites tend to rapidly 
deteriorate because refractory ascites can be 
accompanied by cardiac problems, hepatic 
dysfunction, and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). 
Approximately 50% of patients with refractory 
ascites develop HRS and survival probability 
is dependent on age, type of HRS, and CPS 
class; the mean survival after developing Type 1 
HRS is 1 week, while the probability of survival 
with Type 2 HRS is 38.5% at 1 year.8 TIPS 
may therefore improve survival and limit 
further complications; the optimal window of 
opportunity to intervene should be early in 
the disease course, as soon as ascites are 
classed as diuretic-intractable or refractory. 
In addition to timing, smaller diameter stents 
are recommended for patients with refractory 
ascites16 and, as such, the use of diametercontrolled expansion stents may benefit these 
patients further.28
TIPS has shown superior transplant-free survival 
compared with LVP and albumin treatment43 
(Figure 1), and improves kidney function in 
patients with renal impairment.12,48 It should be 
noted that TIPS may also reduce glomerular 
filtration rate (GFR); Allegretti et al.48 reported 
that in 138 patients who received TIPS, 
estimated GFR declined in 26% of cases. Renal 
failure can be an associated complication 
of TIPS.12 A retrospective study showed that 
TIPS improved survival in comparison with 
paracentesis, yet the improved survival benefit 
declined over time,49 indicating TIPS may 
provide a bridge to liver transplantation. Organ 
allocation is based on MELD scores50 and 
parameters contributing to this score, such as 
creatinine, are affected post-TIPS. Consequently, 
the impact of TIPS placement in patients 
awaiting a liver transplant should be considered 
carefully. Currently, it is recommended that 
eligible patients are transferred to a specialist 
centre and a TIPS procedure be discussed with 
an expert team.13
PATIENT CARE AND TIMING OF 
TRANSJUGULAR INTRAHEPATIC 
PORTOSYSTEMIC SHUNT 
TIPS shows clear benefits for controlling variceal 
bleeding and eradicating refractory ascites, 
yet timing and patient selection are crucial for 
the success of this procedure. Many factors 
contribute to early mortality rates post-TIPS, 
including pre-TIPS severity of liver dysfunction, 
renal failure, cardiac function, previous history 
of HE, and inflammatory status. Assessment 
of these factors should be made pre-TIPS to 
improve outcomes. 
Liver dysfunction post-TIPS, thought to occur 
through excessive shunting and reduced 
portal venous perfusion, may contribute to 
the pathophysiology of HE, caused by hepatic 
insufficiency and increased portosystemic 
shunting.51 However, controlled studies using 
covered stents have not shown an increased 
incidence of HE post-TIPS,32,36,44 and HE 
symptoms can be alleviated upon embolisation 
of any spontaneous physiological shunts 
present.52 To limit liver dysfunction, bilirubin 
levels and platelet count should be examined.20
Detrimental changes in cardiac output will 
influence outcomes, therefore the EASL guidelines 
state that functional cardiac testing should 
be part of a pre-TIPS assessment, as well as a 
standardised assessment of systolic and diastolic 
function for patients with decompensated 
cirrhosis.16 As with many chronic conditions, 
systemic inflammation is present in cirrhosis 
and high levels of proinflammatory markers 
in the hepatic vein are reportedly associated 
with poor outcomes and organ failure;53 the 
inflammatory profile of patients could therefore 
also be examined prior to TIPS.
Regardless of the aforementioned factors, 
timing is crucial, as highlighted in the early TIPS 
setting.36,38 This is supported by the Baveno VI
consensus,2 although physician adherence to 
these guidelines and availability of TIPS are 
lacking.30 In addition, no pre-TIPS testing and 
patient stratification are necessary in the context 
of rescue TIPS because in this instance TIPS 
provides a last resort.

THE FUTURE OF TRANSJUGULAR 
INTRAHEPATIC PORTOSYSTEMIC 
SHUNT THERAPY
In order to maximise the benefit of TIPS in the 
right patients at the right time, the previously 
discussed aspects and limitations need to be 
considered. Further studies are required to 
confirm the role of timing and patient selection, 
particularly for patients with refractory ascites. 
Currently, during the preparatory phase 
pre-TIPS, patients should be routinely assessed 
for liver and cardiac function. Further testing 
may also be beneficial, including renal function 
assessment and a measurement of liver 
stiffness, to aid in the prediction of liver failure 
post-TIPS. Numerous testing strategies are 
also available for HE,51 including a critical flicker 
frequency test that has been reported to 
predict initial episodes of HE in cirrhotic 
patients.54,55 More data are required to assess 
the role of this test in the detection of postTIPS HE and to determine whether this could 
provide a screening tool. More thorough routine 
testing prior to and during follow-up of TIPS 
may reduce the rates of adverse events and 
further complications. 
Further to its use for ascites and variceal 
bleeding, TIPS has potential in other indications, 
including portal vein thrombosis, HRS, 
hepatic hydrothorax, Budd–Chiari syndrome, 
sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, rare bleeding 
(e.g., ectopic varices and portal hypertensive 
gastropathy), and variceal embolisation.10 Portal 
vein thrombosis in particular is a frequent 
occurrence in cirrhotic patients and TIPS has 
been shown to reduce its progression and 
further complications,56 although data exploring

it as an indication are limited. TIPS can also 
reduce malnutrition through a positive effect on 
energy balance, increasing body weight, muscle 
mass, energy expenditure, and energy intake 
(Figure 2).57 Furthermore, reduced muscle mass 
may represent a risk factor for HE development 
post-TIPS and, as such, although sarcopenia 
is not an indication for TIPS, it may be 
improved in some patients and impact outcomes 
post-TIPS.58-60
In patients who do not fit the ideal criteria 
(Table 1),61 TIPS may still provide the only 
viable treatment option. In such cases, the 
benefits and risks of TIPS must be balanced; 
when it provides the only treatment option or 
when transplantation is an option, more risks 
can be taken. However, when transplantation 
is not an option, or in the early TIPS setting, 
more caution is required. For these patients, 
optimising technical parameters, such as the 
use of novel diameter-controlled expansion 
stents, may provide a means of reducing adverse 
events by allowing physicians to better control 
diameter and target the optimal pressure 
gradient for a specific patient. This technology 
offers a promising solution for patients.
CONCLUSION
Covered TIPS shows clear clinical benefits, 
including reduced complications and improved 
transplant-free survival in a subset of patients 
with variceal bleeding and/or recurrent and 
refractory ascites. Importantly, patient selection 
should be considered carefully. Patients without 
a previous history of cardiovascular problems, 
liver dysfunction, and/or HE are prime 
candidates for TIPS, whereas patients with 
poor health, a high MELD score and CPS, high 
bilirubin levels and platelet count, poor 
cardiac reserve, and risk of HE should only be 
considered when all other options are 
exhausted and transplantation is the only route. 
Specialised TIPS teams are required to carry 
out pre-TIPS screening of such factors, as well 
as follow-up monitoring to improve patient 
outcomes. In addition, evolving TIPS practices, 
which show adoption of smaller diameter 
covered stents as well as novel diametercontrolled expansion TIPS, may offer an enhanced 
survival benefit, with data suggesting improved 
control of variceal bleeding, eradication of 
refractory ascites, reduced risk of complications, 
and improved nutritional status.
