We confirmed the strong association of hepatoblastoma with very low birth weight (relative risk o1000 g vs X2000 g ¼ 25.6; 95%
confidence interval: 7.70 – 85.0) and demonstrated independent associations with congenital abnormalities and maternal Asian race in
a population-based Minnesota study that included 36 cases and 7788 controls.

Hepatoblastoma is a rare embryonal tumour that comprises most
cases of liver cancer in children aged 0 –5 years in the United
States (Ries et al, 1999). Although its causes are mostly obscure, it
is apparent that very low birth weight (VLBW), generally defined
as o1500 g, is a potent risk factor (Tanimura et al, 1998; Reynolds
et al, 2004; Ansell et al, 2005; McLaughlin et al, 2006).
Hepatoblastoma incidence doubled between 1975 and 1999
(Spector et al, 2004), possibly related to the concomitant rise in
prevalence of VLBW infants and a marked drop in their mortality
(CDC, 2002). These observations may indicate that some
component of treatment for prematurity is carcinogenic or,
alternatively, that the aetiology may overlap with that of VLBW.
To expand a sparse literature, we examined the relation between
hepatoblastoma and birth characteristics in Minnesota.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The methods used in this case-cohort study have previously been
described (Puumala et al, 2008). Briefly, we matched Minnesota
Cancer Surveillance System (MCSS) records of incident first
cancers diagnosed in children aged 28 days to 14 years during
1988 –2004 to birth records using probabilistic record linkage
(Jaro, 1995). For each of the 2188 successfully linked cases (out of
2655 total) we randomly selected four birth records of children
born in the same year and who survived at least 28 days past birth;
this comparison group of 8752 subjects is referred to as the
subcohort. In this analysis, matching cases were compared to all
subcohort members born in 1982 (i.e., the earliest year a case
would have been born) or later to improve study power.
Exposure variables derived from Minnesota birth records are
shown in Table 1. Some variables were not available during the
entire study period. Birth weight was divided into categories of
o1000, 1000 –1999, and X2000 g to maximize the number of cases
in each stratum. Race was classified as white or non-white. Other
variables were categorized using customary cut offs (Ries et al,
1999).
We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) using stratified Cox regression models using SAS 9.1 (SAS
institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) (Langholz and Jiao, 2007). The
number of cases precluded a full multivariate model. However,
birth weight is a known risk factor; all variables were modelled
adjusting for birth weight as well as for year of birth and sex.
RESULTS
Of 39 cases of hepatoblastoma identified by MCSS, 36 (92.3%)
linked to birth records. Cases were compared to 7788 members of
the subcohort. Exposure frequencies and adjusted HRs are
presented in Table 1; where cell size was o4, we reported
frequencies but did not calculate HRs. There were strong
associations with birth weight o1000 g (HR ¼ 25.6; 95% CI:
7.70 –85.0) and 1000 –1999 g (HR ¼ 9.15; 95% CI: 3.09 –27.1)
compared to X2000 g, their magnitude with each category of low
birth weight was lessened, but remained highly significant, when
adjusting for covariates (data not shown). Significant univariate
associations were noted with maternal and paternal Hispanic
ethnicity, maternal birthplace outside the US, intrauterine
procedures during pregnancy, male sex, gestational age o37
weeks, 1 and 5 min apgar scores, assisted ventilation, and
congenital abnormalities (data not shown). However, only
associations with congenital abnormalities (HR ¼ 5.87; 95% CI:
1.88 –18.3), paternal Hispanic ethnicity (HR ¼ 4.18; 95% CI: 1.22 –
14.3), and maternal birthplace outside the US (HR ¼ 3.55; 95%
CI: 1.51 –8.32) remained significant after adjustment. The association of foreign maternal birthplace reflected the disproportionate
number of cases with mothers from Southeast Asia. Accordingly,
there was a significant adjusted association of maternal Asian race
with hepatoblastoma (HR ¼ 3.86; 95% CI: 1.30 –11.52).
DISCUSSION
Very low birth weight has emerged over the past 15 years as a
potent risk factor for hepatoblastoma (Feusner et al, 1998;

Tanimura et al, 1998; Reynolds et al, 2004; Ansell et al, 2005;
McLaughlin et al, 2006). We have now confirmed this association
in the paediatric population of Minnesota. Unadjusted relative
risks between 16 and 70 comparing very low to moderate birth
weight children have been reported in studies from the United
Kingdom, Japan, and now three US states (Figure 1). This striking
association thus appears across industrialized nations.
Rather than being causative per se, VLBW likely signals
the involvement of correlated factors. Limited multivariate
analyses in this study and others (Reynolds et al, 2004; McLaughlin
et al, 2006) have begun to tease apart the role of other
characteristics from that of VLBW. Notably, preterm birth (o37
weeks) was not an independent risk factor in any of the studies
after adjustment.
We found a strong association with congenital abnormalities,
which was attenuated but still present when controlling for VLBW.
One specific abnormality, an omphalocele, was recorded, which
may be indicative of Beckwith –Wiedemann syndrome, an overgrowth disorder which is known to increase the risk of
hepatoblastoma (Ranzini et al, 1997; DeBaun and Tucker, 1998).
The remaining five abnormalities were nonspecific (one central
nervous system, one urogenital, and three ‘others’). Higher than
expected proportions of congenital abnormalities have previously
been noted among cases (Narod et al, 1997; Ansell et al, 2005), but
without factoring in birth weight.
The association of maternal Asian race, specifically of Southeast
Asian ancestry, with hepatoblastoma was unexpected. Similar
findings were not noted in studies in California (Reynolds
et al, 2004) and New York (McLaughlin et al, 2006), and
there was not an elevated rate in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam
(Nguyen et al, 2000). Our observation was therefore novel
and independent of birth weight. We also observed an independent
association of paternal, but not maternal, Hispanic ethnicity.
This finding may have been an artifact, as its significance
was dependent on two cases for which paternal ethnicity was
missing.
Maternal hypertension (Roberts et al, 2003), maternal tobacco
use (Horta et al, 1997), and conception by assisted reproductive
technology (Schieve et al, 2002) are known to reduce birth weight
and have been examined in other studies. An excess of maternal

pre-eclampsia, without adjustment for VLBW, has been noted
(Ansell et al, 2005). Three previous studies have found that
maternal smoking significantly raised offspring risk (Pang et al,
2003; Sorahan and Lancashire, 2004; McLaughlin et al, 2006),
whereas a fourth did not (Buckley et al, 1989); associations
remained after adjustment for VLBW in two studies (Pang et al,
2003; Spector and Ross, 2003; McLaughlin et al, 2006). Lastly, a
ninefold increased risk of hepatoblastoma was reported among
children born following infertility treatment, which was independent of birth weight (McLaughlin et al, 2006). That maternal
smoking and conception by assisted reproductive technology
remain as risk factors after adjustment for VLBW suggests that if
causal relationships exist, they operate independently of birth
weight.
Use of population-based registry data was the major strength of
this study, as any misclassification would most likely be nondifferential and HRs would be underestimated. Birth characteristics and delivery methods are reliably recorded in birth records
whereas other factors, including congenital abnormalities, are
substantially underreported (Northam and Knapp, 2006), contributing to sparse data for several variables. Although cases that
occurred among outmigrating children or those who resided in
Minnesota during 1982 –1987 would have been missed, this
occurrence is unlikely given the very low incidence of hepatoblastoma. Lastly, the small number of cases resulted in a reduced
ability to perform multivariate analyses.
The strong association of hepatoblastoma with VLBW has
been robust to adjustment for other factors. That control for
several prenatal determinants of small infant size has not explained
the VLBW association may indicate that postnatal treatment is
the causative correlate. Although three very small case –
control studies of neonatal medical history among VLBW
infants preliminarily suggest greater oxygen exposure in
cases (Maruyama et al, 1999, 2000; Oue et al, 2003), larger studies
are plainly required. Therefore, a multicenter case – control study
has been initiated (National Institutes of Health Grant
R01CA111355; L Spector, Principal Investigator) that will examine
risk factors for hepatoblastoma, with a special focus on VLBW
infants.
