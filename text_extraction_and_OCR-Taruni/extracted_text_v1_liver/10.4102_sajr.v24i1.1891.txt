Introduction
Hepatic mesenchymal hamartoma is an uncommon, benign, paediatric tumour, most commonly 
encountered during the first 24 months of life. Because of an excellent prognosis, distinguishing 
this tumour type from other liver masses is essential, and confident perioperative diagnosis could 
be made on the basis of characteristic imaging features.
Case presentation
An 11-month-old male patient presented at the department of paediatrics with a 3-month 
history of progressive abdominal distension. The child was otherwise systemically well, born at 
term and had no significant background medical history. Clinical examination revealed an 
upper abdominal mass lesion, non-tender and firm to palpation. Ensuing abdominal ultrasound 
showed a complex solid-cystic upper abdominal mass lesion, with concern for possible hydatid 
disease. Initial biochemistry revealed mild elevation in gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) 
with a marginally elevated alfa fetoprotein (AFP) level of 44.4 μg/L (reference range: 0.6 μg/L – 
7.9 μg/L, as per the National Health Laboratory Service [NHLS]). Hydatid serology, blood 
cultures and confirmatory human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing were negative. Further 
imaging was then preformed.
Contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) in the portal venous phase 
demonstrated a large, well-demarcated intraperitoneal mass (Figure 1), measuring approximately 
17 cm × 16 cm × 15 cm. The mass was localised within the right abdomen, displacing the bowel to 
the left. It was abutting the inferior border of the liver with a poor plane of separation. However, 
there was no hepatic parenchymal claw sign, precluding a confident diagnosis of hepatic origin. 
The mass extended into the central abdomen as well as into the flank and pelvis on the right. It 
showed an inhomogeneous attenuation pattern with moderately enhancing soft tissue 
components, large low attenuating cystic areas and low attenuating tubular structures. No overt 
calcification or fat elements were demonstrable. The lesion significantly displaced the surrounding 
viscera, with a degree of bowel attenuation, but there was no bowel obstruction or features of 
direct local invasion. Minimal abdominopelvic free fluid was noted and no significant 
lymphadenopathy was visualised. The gall bladder, hepatic artery and portal venous system 
were normal, with other imaged structures unremarkable.
Based on the above-mentioned imaging findings, the initial differential diagnoses included that of 
primary hepatic lesions as well as extra-hepatic mesenteric lesions. The most likely diagnosis 
within each category was a hepatic mesenchymal hamartoma and mesenteric lymphatic 
malformation respectively.
Hepatic mesenchymal hamartoma is a rare hepatic tumour seen in the paediatric population. 
Although this entity has a variable imaging appearance, it has a favourable prognosis if 
diagnosed and managed correctly. This case presents the ultrasound and computed tomography 
findings of an 11-month-old patient who presented with a history of progressive abdominal 
distension and an elevated alfa fetoprotein level on biochemistry. The case describes how a 
confident perioperative diagnosis could be made on the basis of characteristic imaging features.

The child was referred to a tertiary institution for further 
management. Because of delay in follow-up, a repeat 
abdominal CT was performed approximately 4 weeks after 
the initial study. This was carried out to evaluate for interval 
growth and assist in surgical planning. It revealed the mass 
to have shifted into the left-sided abdomen, completely 
separable from the right and left liver lobes, with displacement 
of the bowel to the right (Figure 2). A thin pedicle could now 
be identified connecting the mass to the caudate lobe of the 
liver (Figure 3). The mass showed no interval change in size. 
A pedunculated hepatic mesenchymal hamartoma was 
confidently diagnosed, with no need for further imaging. 
Given the lack of markedly raised AFP levels, a 
hepatoblastoma was a less likely, however, still important in 
the differential diagnosis.
Subsequent laparotomy confirmed a large pedunculated 
mass arising from the caudate lobe of the liver. The 
lesion was excised and sent for histological evaluation. 
Macroscopic pathological assessment showed solid 
components with the appearance of haemorrhagic liver 
parenchyma with areas of haemorrhage as well as cystic 
components, the largest measuring 30 mm × 25 mm × 
20 mm. The cysts contained yellow serous fluid with a 
smooth, unilocular inner cystic wall. Areas of necrosis and 
calcification were not identified.
Microscopic and immunohistochemical evaluation showed 
clusters of hepatocytes, without cellular atypia, along with 
numerous bile ducts of variable proportions, haphazardly 
arranged within an oedematous fibromyxoid stroma. The 
stroma consisted of spindled fibroblasts with numerous 
vascular spaces interspersed with the bile duct. The cysts were 
lined with a single layer of columnar epithelium, also without 
atypia. Areas of acute haemorrhage were noted, with 
prominent vascular ectasia. No granulomatous inflammation, 
viral cytopathy, parasites, protozoa or features of invasive 
malignancy were visualised. These findings are in keeping 
with a histological diagnosis of hepatic mesenchymal 
hamartoma.
A 3-month follow-up ultrasound revealed a normal liver 
with no residual or recurrent tumour.

Discussion
Hepatic mesenchymal hamartoma is an uncommon, benign 
tumour with an excellent prognosis, which may be 
encountered during paediatric imaging, typically in patients 
aged between 1 month and 4–5 years.1 A slight male 
predominance is documented. As the term ‘hamartoma’ 
implies, it should rather be considered a developmental 
malformation than a true neoplasm. Very rarely these 
hamartomas can undergo malignant degeneration into 
undifferentiated embryonal sarcoma. Mesenchymal 
hamartomas were first described in the literature by 
Edmondson in 1956.2 Initially, these lesions were variably 
named as hepatic or giant lymphangiomas, bile duct 
fibroadenomas, and cavernous lympangiomatoid tumours 
before being grouped together under the term ‘mesenchymal 
hamartoma’. Association with polycystic kidney disease, 
congenital hepatic fibrosis and biliary hamartomas has been 
described.1,3,4
Clinical presentation varies on the basis of tumour size. 
Smaller hamartomas are usually asymptomatic, with a 
FIGURE 1: Initial imaging – Axial and coronal contrast-enhanced computed 
tomography of the abdomen (portal venous phase) demonstrates a large, 
complex mass lesion in the right abdomen. It abuts the inferior liver border with 
a poor plane of separation and displaces the bowel to the left (arrowheads). 
There is a lack of peripheral hepatic parenchymal extension along the edges of 
the mass (claw sign); therefore, hepatic origin cannot confidently be suggested. 
Solid and cystic elements are clearly distinguishable (arrow) with the classic 
‘swiss cheese appearance’.

painless mass lesion incidentally discovered on abdominal 
examination. Pathologically, the neoplasm develops and 
progressively enlarges because of mesenchymal proliferation, 
with the development of multiple fluid-containing cysts 
contributing to the rapid enlargement of mass. Whilst wellcircumscribed, this mass is unencapsulated.5,6
 Serum AFP 
levels can be within the normal limits, but can also be elevated 
because of the proliferation of hepatocytes in the neoplasm.5,7
Elevated GGT, but otherwise normal liver function tests, is 
also reported.1,3
Regarding serum AFP levels in the paediatric population, 
these levels are routinely used as an important biomarker for 
hepatoblastoma, where values are typically very elevated 
(up to approximately 100 000 times the normal value). 
However, this is limited in terms of sensitivity and specificity 
for the diagnosis of malignancy, as it is a tumour-associated 
and not a tumour-specific protein. A mild elevation in serum 
levels can be seen with other malignant and non-malignant 
conditions, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, mesenchymal 
hamartoma, cirrhosis, viral and chronic active hepatitis, and 
ulcerative colitis, to name but a few. In patients with 
hepatoblastoma, 5%–10% of these may have a low or even 
normal AFP level. Concentrations are also age-specific, with 
high levels observed in neonates and exceedingly high levels 
in preterm neonates. Levels usually decline and reach normal 
concentrations at 8–12 months of age. Alfa fetoprotein levels 
should thus be correlated with imaging and histopathology 
findings whilst taking the patient’s age into account.8,9,10
Mesenchymal hamartomas are commonly large at the time of 
diagnosis, weighing over 1 kg, and most commonly arise 
from the right lobe of the liver. These lesions arise from the 
mesoderm within portal tracts. Pathological hallmarks are 
clusters of normal hepatocytes in a matrix of porous 
mesenchyme, which allows accumulation of fluid as it 
degenerates, predisposing to cyst formation. Additional 
cystic elements are attributable to dilated biliary ducts.1
Radiological imaging plays a major role in both diagnosis 
and planning the surgical approach to the lesion, as clinical 
and biochemical features are nonspecific.2 Plain abdominal 
FIGURE 2: Follow-up imaging – Abdominal computed tomography scout image and coronal contrast-enhanced imaging (portal venous phase) demonstrates the mass to 
have shifted into the left abdomen (arrow), causing displacement of the bowel to the right (arrowheads). This reveals the mass to be mobile and separable from the right 
and left liver lobes.
FIGURE 3: Follow-up imaging – Axial contrast-enhanced computed 
tomography of the abdomen (portal venous phase) shows the mass within the 
left upper abdomen. A thin pedicle is seen connecting the mass to the caudate 
lobe of the liver (arrowheads). This confirms a pedunculated mass of hepatic 
origin.

radiographs may show hepatomegaly or a paucity of bowel 
gas in the right upper quadrant, suggesting a hepatic mass 
lesion. Sonography is the modality of choice for initial 
assessment in the paediatric age group. Right upper quadrant 
findings can vary from large, septated cysts to small cysts 
with thick septations, with varying degrees of associated 
solid echogenic tissue, in relation to the liver and separable 
from the biliary tree. Computed tomography confirms 
sonographic findings, and better delineates the extent of the 
mass lesion and relationship to other intra-abdominal 
viscera. The appearance is commonly that of a well-defined 
solitary mass lesion of hepatic origin, either completely 
intrahepatic, partially extrahepatic, and with an exophytic or 
pedunculated pattern of growth. Enhancing soft tissue 
elements are usually seen surrounding a central area of 
simple fluid attenuation, with variable degrees of internal 
septation and loculation. This multi-cystic configuration is 
commonly labelled as a ‘swiss cheese appearance’. 
Completely solid, stromal predominant tumours are rarely 
seen and are usually smaller lesions. Haemorrhage is 
uncommon. Calcification, although it may very rarely occur 
in these lesions, is much more commonly seen in other 
tumours. Computed tomography appearance may be 
deceiving in instances where cysts mimic tumour necrosis 
seen in malignant hepatic neoplasms, and ultrasound or 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is helpful to differentiate 
simple anechoic cysts from liquefied tissue.1,3,4
Scintigraphy with technetium-labelled sulphur colloid 
confirms the presence and position of either a solitary or 
multiple photopenic masses, as the hamartoma lacks Kupffer 
cells. This modality is otherwise non-specific regarding further 
delineation.1 Magnetic resonance imaging has a value in 
confidently establishing hepatic origin in cases of large, 
pedunculated, predominantly cystic lesions and to accurately 
delineate solid and cystic components, septations and relations 
to surrounding structures – especially the intrahepatic 
vasculature and the biliary system. Appearance may vary 
depending on composition. The T1 signal intensity of cystic 
components may differ based on the concentration of protein 
in the fluid but usually approximates water intensity on T2-
weighted imaging. Solid components may appear hypointense 
to adjacent liver on both T1- and T2-weighted sequences 
because of fibrosis. Enhancement post-gadolinium is usually 
mild and confined to the septal and stromal elements.3,4
Differential diagnoses include benign and malignant hepatic 
or intra-abdominal masses, as summarised in Table 1. 
Occasionally, when the mass is large, the organ of origin is 
difficult to identify. As such, extrahepatic considerations 
of other cystic intra-abdominal mass lesions are often 
included in the differential diagnosis. These include hydatid 
cysts, mesenteric lymphatic malformations, gastrointestinal 
duplication cysts and cystic teratomas of the mesentery.11
Intrahepatic considerations are simple congenital hepatic 
cysts, which are generally rare in children and are not septated, 
or form part of the spectrum of polycystic kidney disease, 
where renal cysts are also present. Choledochal cysts are also 
not septated but are coupled with a degree of biliary dilation. 
Infectious foci, such as abscesses, have a different clinical 
picture with more complex internal content. Amoebic 
abscesses and hydatid diseases are also considered, but 
biochemical assessment helps in the diagnosis. Mesenchymal 
hamartomas with a larger degree of soft tissue may mimic 
cystic hepatoblastomas, the focal form of infantile hepatic 
haemangiomas, cavernous haemangiomas (adult-type hepatic 
haemangiomas), teratomas or hepatocellular carcinomas in 
older patients. Cavernous haemangiomas usually demonstrate 
a typical pattern of avid peripheral enhancement with 
centripetal fill-in, but differentiation could be challenging. 
Teratomas commonly contain fat and calcification. Calcification 
is also common in hepatoblastomas and infantile hepatic 
haemangiomas, which are more solid in nature. Alfa 
fetoprotein is significantly elevated with hepatoblastoma. 
Generally, the relatively poor enhancement of the solid 
components of cystic mesenchymal hamartomas helps in 
differentiation from these lesions. Undifferentiated embryonal 
sarcomas, an even rarer entity, may be indistinguishable from 
cystic mesenchymal hamartomas.1,2,3,4

These neoplasms may undergo malignant transformation, 
and, as a result, complete surgical excision, with clear margins, 
remains the mainstay of treatment.6 There is a strong 
association with undifferentiated embryonal sarcomas, which 
are especially aggressive and have a poor prognosis.12,13 Longterm follow-up is necessary post-resection. Treatment with 
surgical resection is usually curative and yields admirable 
results. Partial lobectomy is commonly needed to remove 
larger tumours. The large size of these tumours makes 
the surgery technically challenging. If respiratory distress is 
the presenting complaint, percutaneous catheter drainage of 
large cystic elements is frequently performed as a temporising 
measure prior to surgical intervention.1,3
Conclusions
Hepatic mesenchymal hamartoma is a rare hepatic tumour 
with a variable imaging appearance that has an excellent 
prognosis if identified and managed appropriately. In rare 
instances, malignant degeneration to undifferentiated 
embryonal sarcoma could arise whilst having a similar 
imaging appearance. A high index of suspicion should be 
asserted in all cases of asymptomatic, cystic liver masses in 
children and a clear understanding of the most important 
differential diagnoses is imperative.
