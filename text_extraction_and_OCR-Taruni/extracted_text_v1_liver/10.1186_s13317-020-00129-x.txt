Abstract
Unlike in other autoimmune liver diseases such as autoimmune hepatitis and primary biliary cholangitis, the role and 
nature of autoantigenic targets in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), a progressive, chronic, immune-mediated, life 
threatening, genetically predisposed, cholestatic liver illness, is poorly elucidated. Although anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) have been associated with the occurrence of PSC, their corresponding targets have not 
yet been identifed entirely. Genome-wide association studies revealed a signifcant number of immune-related and 
even disease-modifying susceptibility loci for PSC. However, these loci did not allow discerning a clear autoimmune 
pattern nor do the therapy options and the male gender preponderance in PSC support a pathogenic role of autoimmune responses. Nevertheless, PSC is characterized by the co-occurrence of infammatory bowel diseases (IBD) 
demonstrating autoimmune responses. The identifcation of novel autoantigenic targets in IBD such as the major 
zymogen granule membrane glycoprotein 2 (GP2) or the appearance of proteinase 3 (PR3) autoantibodies (autoAbs) 
have refocused the interest on a putative association of loss of tolerance with the IBD phenotype and consequently 
with the PSC phenotype. Not surprisingly, the report of an association between GP2 IgA autoAbs and disease severity 
in patients with PSC gave a new impetus to autoAb research for autoimmune liver diseases. It might usher in a new 
era of serological research in this feld. The mucosal loss of tolerance against the microbiota-sensing GP2 modulating innate and adaptive intestinal immunity and its putative role in the pathogenesis of PSC will be elaborated in this 
review. Furthermore, other potential PSC-related autoantigenic targets such as the neutrophil PR3 will be discussed. 
GP2 IgA may represent a group of new pathogenic antibodies, which share characteristics of both type 2 and 3 of 
antibody-mediated hypersensitive reactions according to Coombs and Gell.

The putative impact of autoimmunity in PSC
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic 
immune-mediated, life threatening, genetically predisposed liver disease with a largely unknown pathogenesis 
[1]. Te prevalence of PSC is estimated at up to 16.2 per 
100,000 individuals and is increasing [2–4].

Primary sclerosing cholangitis is characterized by cholestasis due to infammatory and fbrotic changes in large 
bile ducts. Te disease has a progressive course eventually resulting in biliary fbrosis and liver cirrhosis in a 
proportion of cases fnally. Moreover, patients with PSC 
have an increased risk to develop hepatobiliary (most 
frequently cholangiocarcinoma [CCA]) and extrahepatic 
neoplasia independent of the duration and activity of the 
disease. To date there is no causative treatment available 
and liver transplantation remains the only curative therapy [1, 4].
Te impact of autoimmune responses in the pathophysiology of PSC is still largely unknown. Neither 
therapeutic options nor male gender preponderance in 
PSC are indicative for a signifcant pathogenic role of 
autoimmune responses. Indeed, the administration of 
immunosuppressive drugs for PSC patients is at least 
controversial and rarely recommended [5, 6]. Only in 
the case of an overlap with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), 
immunosuppressive therapy is considered [7].
Cellular immune responses might be involved in the 
pathophysiology of PSC [8]. However, in contrast to 
primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), regulatory follicular 
T helper cells in patients with PSC appear to have less 
impact on the cholestatic pathophysiology [9].
Te currently known susceptibility loci do also not 
allow to discern a clear autoimmune pattern, though 
the association with distinct HLA haplotypes suggests 
an involvement of acquired immune responses [10]. In 
particular, the association of such susceptibility loci as 
CD28, IL2 and IL2RA (alpha subunit of the high-afnity 
IL2 receptor) with PSC risk lends credit to the assumption that the T lymphocyte-focused IL-2 pathway plays 
a putative role in the pathogenesis of PSC. In this context, an enterohepatic circulation of lymphocytes primed 
in the gut and supported by a pathological co-expression 
of adhesion molecules (vascular adhesion protein 1, 
mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1) in the liver 
and gut of patients with PSC and IBD has been suggested 
[11, 12].
Of interest, PSC is associated with the co-occurrence 
of infammatory bowel diseases (IBD) which are known 
to be afected by autoimmune responses [13, 14]. Up to 
70% of PSC cases show concomitant IBD, especially the 
distinct phenotype of ulcerative colitis (UC) [2]. Tis 
appears to be a unique feature among autoimmune 
liver diseases. Patients with PBC rarely sufer from IBD 
whereas only approximately 8% of AIH presenting as 
overlap with PSC show concomitant IBD [15].
Te two main clinical entities of IBD are Crohn’s disease (CD) and UC, both relapsing systemic infammatory 
illnesses [13, 14, 16, 17]. As one of the most frequently 
diagnosed IBD in Caucasians (up to 322 per 100,000 
individuals in Europe), CD can afect any segment of the 
digestive tract and is characterized by transmural infammation [18, 19]. Prevalence rates of UC, which demonstrates superfcial mucosal ulcerations restricted to the 
colon, may even reach 505 per 100,000 individuals [20, 
21].
Primary sclerosing cholangitis patients with concomitant UC demonstrated an elevated risk of liver disease progression [5]. Conversely, CD and IBD absence 
appeared to confer prognostic favor in PSC and a lower 
risk to develop adverse efects. Of note, with regard to 
location of disease, CD in PSC seems to involve the colon 
and rarely the small bowel alone. Te onset of IBD symptoms in PSC is variable and a trend towards IBD preceding PSC with a milder but more extensive intestinal 
infammation compared to classical CD and UC has been 
observed [22].
Akin to PSC, there is no causal treatment for IBD 
and the illness may progress with repeated fare-ups to 
therapy or digestive failure requiring surgical intervention [23, 24]. Moreover, IBD is also associated with an 
increased risk of various intestinal and extraintestinal 
malignancies occurring already in adolescents and young 
adults [25–27]. Most likely owing to environmental factors such as Western lifestyle, diet, and industrialization, 
an alarming rise in the incidence and prevalence of IBD is 
noticed worldwide whereas comorbidity with PSC in IBD 
in common is underestimated [2, 19].
To date, 23 susceptibility loci have been identifed by 
genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for PSC [28]. 
In contrast, recent GWAS for CD and UC revealed 163 
IBD-associated loci with a certain overlap for both entities [29, 30]. Tese regions contain candidate genes for a 
variety of functions such as autophagy, microbe recognition, lymphocyte signaling, response to endoplasmic 
reticulum stress, cytokine signaling and others. Regarding the comparison of susceptibility loci of PSC and 
concomitant IBD, signifcant associations to the same 
region of the genome appeared not always to be driven 
by a common causal variant. Moreover, genome-wide 
comparisons of PSC with CD and UC showed that the 
comorbid gastrointestinal infammation seen in the 
majority of PSC patients cannot be fully explained by a 
shared genetic risk [28]. Tus, PSC and comorbid PSC/
IBD phenotypes might be diferent entities at least in 
terms of the genetic background. Consequently, autoimmune responses in PSC and PSC with concomitant IBD 
could evolve on a diferent genetic background.
Humoral autoimmune responses in PSC
Given the close association of PSC with IBD, the discovery of distinct autoantigenic targets in IBD and the use 
of the corresponding autoantibodies (autoAbs) for IBD 

Lopens et al. Autoimmun Highlights (2020) 11:6 Page 3 of 14
serology renewed the interest in humoral autoimmune 
responses in PSC [16, 17]. Despite numerous attempts, 
however, no autoantigenic targets could be identifed in 
PSC for a long time. Moreover, PSC-specifc autoAbs 
determined by immunofuorescence assay (IFA) did not 
correlate with severity or phenotype of disease. Nevertheless, similar to IBD, research on the presumed impact 
of autoimmune responses in PSC was mainly triggered by 
autoAb studies [31].
Te occurrence of autoAbs in IBD was frst shown 
for UC by revealing autoreactivity against intestinal cellular antigens in the late 1950s [32–34]. Later, humoral 
autoreactivity against neutrophil targets was reported 
in patients with UC and interestingly PSC by the detection of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoAbs (ANCA) with 
immunofuorescence assay (IFA) [35–37].
In CD, the frst report on humoral autoimmunity referred to the occurrence of autoAbs against buccal mucosa cells [38] and, later on, to exocrine pancreas 
(PAb) ascertained by IFA [39, 40]. Whereas autoimmunity in UC could be linked to the site of colonic infammation, the occurrence of PAb in CD remained an 
unsolved enigma until recently. Tough there is a certain 
correlation of PAb with idiopathic chronic pancreatitis 
as extraintestinal complication, the frequency thereof 
is virtually the same in PAb-positive and PAb-negative 
patients with CD [41–44]. Tus, the role of a loss of tolerance to exocrine glands of the oral cavity and in particular to the exocrine pancreas is difcult to explain in the 
context of infammatory changes in the intestine [45].
In PSC, humoral autoimmunity in the form of autoAbs to several targets including biliary epithelial targets 
was reported [31, 46]. However, only atypical ANCA 
detected by IFA or more precisely peripheral anti-neutrophil nuclear autoAbs (p-ANNA) recognizing a putative 50 kDa protein of the nuclear membrane have been 
considered diagnostic for PSC [47–50]. Te abbreviation p-ANNA should not be confused with antineuronal 
nuclear antibody (Ab) used in the context of the serology 
of paraneoplastic neuronal autoimmunity.
Until lately, there have been only few reports that the 
above mentioned autoAbs in patients with IBD and PSC 
are correlated with clinical parameters or even the phenotype of the disease. Consequently, they have not widely 
been employed in clinical routine. Tus, the identifcation of the respective autoantigenic targets could help in 
shedding light on the role of humoral autoimmunity in 
IBD and PSC. Tis would furthermore enable the development of clinically useful tools for the diagnosis thereof.
Identifcation of autoantigenic targets in CD
Autoimmune processes have been considered to play 
an active role in disease development and to modulate 
infammatory processes in CD [51]. Terefore, the recent 
identifcation of humoral autoantigens in CD provided 
a new impetus for this hypothesis. Moreover, the subsequent detection of these new autoAbs and their association with the phenotype and severity of PSC was a 
remarkable fnding [52].
Only 25 years after the frst report on PAb in patients 
with CD and numerous unsuccessful attempts by several 
research groups, the corresponding molecular autoantigenic targets could be discovered [40, 53–57]. Lastly, glycoprotein 2 (GP2) was independently described by two 
groups as autoantigenic target of PAb associated with 
CD [58, 59]. Apart from GP2, Stöcker’s group discovered 
CUB/zona pellucida like domain-containing protein 1 
(CUZD1) as a second antigenic target of PAb [59]. Interestingly, PAb stain diferent exocrine pancreatic moieties 
in IFA and two types of PAb are reported (type I; extracellular drop-like staining of the acinar lumen; type II: 
speckled cytoplasmic staining of acinar cells) [60, 61]. As 
the majority of type II PAb-positive sera revealed concomitant PAb I reactivity, these two IFA patterns could 
also be the result of just one autoantigenic target such as 
GP2 [45, 62].
Altogether, the identifcation of GP2 and CUZD1 as 
autoantigenic targets in CD ushered in a new era in IBD 
serology and triggered an impressive number of clinical 
studies investigating the potential role of the respective 
autoAbs in the diferential diagnosis of IBD [63, 64].
Already two meta-analyses encompassing 17 and 15 
serological studies have been reported to date [65, 66]. 
For GP2 autoAbs they revealed pooled diagnostic sensitivities of 24% and 20% as well as pooled diagnostic specifcities of 96% and 93%, respectively. In comparison to 
the established Ab to Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ASCA) 
in CD serology, autoAbs to GP2 demonstrated a remarkable specifcity allowing even the discrimination of intestinal diseases with similar clinical symptoms such as 
intestinal tuberculosis and Behcet’s disease [67]. Tis is of 
diagnostic importance, since these illnesses are difcult 
to discriminate from CD by endoscopic methods, which 
are still the basic tools for gastroenterologists in the context of this diferential diagnosis. Of note, patients double positive for GP2 autoAb and ASCA showed a 100% 
specifcity regarding the diferentiation of CD from UC 
underscoring the usefulness of autoAb/Ab profling in 
the diferential diagnosis of IBD [68].
Te moderate sensitivity of GP2 autoAb appears to 
limit its use as diagnostic marker for CD [66]. However, 
signifcant associations of CD-specifc autoAbs could be 
established with the severity and phenotype of disease 
stratifed in accordance with the Montreal classifcation 
by diferent studies [64]. Tus, GP2 autoAbs are linked 
with onset of disease at younger age (A1), ileal/ileocolonic 

Lopens et al. Autoimmun Highlights (2020) 11:6 Page 4 of 14
infammation (L1/L3) and a more severe course of disease (B2/B3). Regarding the latter, GP2 autoAbs are correlated with progressive strictures and need for surgery 
in CD [69, 70]. Altogether, given the variability of the CD 
phenotype, GP2 autoAb appears to be a valuable marker 
for a severe CD with fbrotic manifestations. Moreover, it 
could aid in the diferentiation of recently proposed clinical subtypes of CD [71]. In contrast to fecal calprotectin, an established surrogate marker of active intestinal 
infammation in IBD, GP2 autoAb levels do not correlate 
with disease activity [72]. However, GP2 autoAb appears 
to be linked with the chronicity of infammation as shown 
for the occurrence of GP2 IgA in celiac disease [73–75]. 
Similar to celiac disease-specifc IgA reactive with transglutaminase or deamidated gliadin, GP2 IgA levels were 
signifcantly reduced and eventually became negative 
after the initiation of a gluten-free diet as causal therapy 
[73]. Tus, GP2 IgA could be a candidate for a marker for 
the successful treatment of CD from an immunological 
point of view.
Similar studies for autoAbs to CUZD1 supporting an 
association with disease phenotypes (early onset and 
perianal disease) have been scarce or have not shown a 
signifcant correlation [76–78]. Papp et al. [52] reported 
GP2 autoAbs as an independent predictor of surgery 
whereas autoAbs to CUZD1 predicted perianal disease in 
the only prospective study available to date. For the frst 
time, GP2 and CUZD1 autoAbs were associated with the 
co-occurrence of PSC and cutaneous manifestations in 
this study, respectively [52]. Michales et al. [77] deploying 
the same assay techniques, however, could not confrm 
signifcant associations with extraintestinal manifestations. Nevertheless, the prospective study by Papp et al. 
was the starting point for the investigation of GP2 as an 
antigenic target in PSC.
Remarkably, GP2 autoAb occurrence could be linked 
with de novo CD in patients sufering from severe UC 
with pouchitis after colectomy and ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) [79, 80]. Tis underscores a close link of 
the occurrence of GP2 autoAbs with the change of microbiota within the pathophysiology of CD-like symptoms 
in a formerly UC-driven infammatory environment. 
Further evidence for an infectious origin with related 
changes of the microbiota comes from studies on the 
animal model of CD in ruminants with Mycobacterium 
avium induced paratuberculosis [81–83]. GP2 appears to 
be the only specifc target of PAb linked with the loss of 
tolerance seen in this animal model.
Identifcation of autoantigenic targets in UC
In contrast to CD, ANCA to unknown neutrophil targets 
were already reported in the 1980s as serological markers of PSC and UC [35, 37]. However, the attempts to 
discover the corresponding autoantigenic targets of these 
ANCA or of UC-specifc autoAb to intestinal goblet cells 
did not provide consistent results [84, 85].
Teegen et al. [85] have reported DNA-bound lactoferrin as the main autoantigenic target of ANCA in patients 
with UC, however, the fnding has not yet been confrmed by others. Nonetheless, these autoAbs to a neutrophil target in combination with DNA showed a  high 
prevalence in patients with UC recently [86]. In this 
extensive prospective evaluation of autoAbs and antimicrobial Abs in patients with UC, only ASCA IgA could 
be identifed as an independent predictor of long-term 
immunosuppressive therapy with regard to the clinical 
phenotype association of UC-specifc antibodies [86]. 
Tis was a surprising fnding, as ASCA was commonly 
reported to be specifc for CD.
Moreover, the identifcation of a colon specifc 40 kDa 
murine protein linked to UC could be reproduced in 
humans, but the sequence analysis of this target failed to 
match it with a particular molecule [87].
Hence, the independent reports of autoAbs to proteinase 3 (PR3), a neutrophil target, by sensitive beadbased chemiluminescence and fuorescence techniques 
in patients with UC provided a new diagnostic option 
for the diferential diagnosis of IBD [88–91]. Despite the 
excellent discrimination of UC from CD by PR3-autoAb 
positivity and the association with more extensive infammation in UC, the fnding raised a controversial discussion. PR3 autoAb, also referred to as PR3-ANCA, has 
been considered a specifc marker of granulomatosis with 
polyangiitis (GPA) formerly known as Wegener’s granulomatosis [92]. Moreover, the majority of PR3 autoAbpositive sera of patients with GPA appear to demonstrate 
a classical cytoplasmic staining pattern on neutrophils 
(cANCA) by IFA. Tis fnding is not in line with the 
atypical perinuclear ANCA or perinuclear antineutrophil 
nuclear antibody (p-ANNA) pattern commonly determined with sera of UC patients.
Nevertheless, this intriguing fnding warrants further 
clinical evaluation to elucidate the putative autoantigenic 
role of PR3 in UC and its possible link with the pathophysiology in GPA. It provides further evidence, however, 
for a potential role for neutrophils in the pathophysiology 
of IBD as does the report of DNA-dependent lactoferrin 
autoAbs. Due to the high prevalence of concomitant UC 
in patients with PSC, the question of a potential role of 
PR3 as an autoantigenic target in PSC began to appear on 
the horizon.
Autoantigenic targets in PSC—lessons from humoral 
autoimmunity in IBD
At the beginning of the millennium, IgG autoAbs recognizing biliary epithelial cells have been shown to be 

Lopens et al. Autoimmun Highlights (2020) 11:6 Page 5 of 14
specifc for PSC and in this context combine adaptive and 
innate immune responses [46, 93]. However, despite their 
reported potentially pathophysiological implications, to 
date the autoimmune targets of these autoAbs have not 
been identifed. Nevertheless, this is another important 
fnding, which underscores the involvement of loss of tolerance in the pathogenesis of PSC.
Of note, all other relevant PSC-specifc autoAbs appear 
to recognize non-biliary targets [48]. Tus, the search for 
autoantigenic targets in PSC was increasingly based on 
serological studies with IBD patients.
Akin to UC, atypical ANCA or more precisely 
p-ANNA have been one of the most debated diagnostic 
markers in PSC [48, 94]. After the promising discovery 
of a neutrophil, nuclear envelope-target molecule for 
p-ANNA, Terjung et al. [95] identifed beta-tubulin isotype 5 as a novel ANCA autoantigen in PSC. Tis target 
shares a high structural homology with the microbial cell 
division protein FtsZ. Unfortunately, this fnding could 
not be corroborated in other studies [96]. Moreover, all 
these autoAbs and their corresponding targets previously 
reported in patients with PSC do not seem to be directly 
associated with the clinical symptoms of the illness [31, 
97].
Tus, the report on PR3 autoAbs detected by a sensitive chemiluminescence assay in patients with PSC and 
its correlation with elevated liver enzymes, particularly 
with alkaline phosphatase, renewed the interest in potential ANCA targets in PSC [98]. As outlined above in the 
context of UC, the pathophysiological role of a tolerance 
loss to PR3 in PSC is controversial due to the established 
role of PR3 as a specifc autoantigenic target in GPA. Of 
note, a recent case report of a female patient with suspected hepatically localized GPA could be an illustrating 
example in this context [99]. Te frst diagnostic assumption focused on vasculitis and particularly GPA as the 
cause of clinical symptoms due to the PR3 autoAb positivity. However, because of the lack of both typical GPA 
symptoms and involvement of other organs on the one 
hand and elevated alkaline phosphatase levels on the 
other hand, this diagnosis was not confrmed [99]. In 
contrast, the PR3 autoAb positivity along with the cholestatic symptoms rather suggested the presence of PSC 
with concomitant loss of tolerance to neutrophil components and not GPA.
Besides the association of PR3 autoAb with the PSC 
phenotype, another groundbreaking fnding came into 
the spotlight of autoimmune research in PSC. Te frst 
report in the year 2015 on the association of GP2 autoAb 
with concomitant PSC in patients with UC triggered 
several studies on the role of loss of tolerance to GP2 in 
PSC [52]. Tis fnding could be corroborated by the same 
group in an elegant prospective study in patients with UC 
demonstrating a correlation of GP2 IgA and not IgG with 
UC and concomitant PSC [86]. Since GP2 autoAb has 
been confrmed as a highly specifc serological marker 
for CD, this indicates that this autoAb is associated with 
PSC and not with UC. It also provides an explanation for 
the “false-positive” UC cases for the GP2 autoAb. Tis 
assumption was supported by a seminal paper investigating two independent European PSC cohorts [100]. 
A remarkable prevalence of around 50% was shown for 
GP2 IgA in patients with PSC, secondary cholangitis and 
most intriguingly CCA. Moreover, GP2 IgA was signifcantly associated with disease severity and poor patient 
survival in this study [100]. Te latter association was 
mainly due to CCA and its corresponding high mortality rate. Whereas Tornai et al. also reported a weak but 
signifcant association of CUZD1 IgA with PSC in UC 
patients, CUZD1 IgG as well as IgA did not show any 
correlation with the disease phenotype in the two other 
European PSC cohorts [100]. Altogether, this was the 
frst report linking an autoAb with the phenotype and 
occurrence of CCA in patients with PSC. More interesting is the fact that IgA and not IgG reactivity to GP2 was 
responsible for this correlation. Tis hints at an involvement of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). 
Recently, Tornai et al. [101] confrmed the association of 
GP2 IgA with the severity of PSC in a prospective study 
demonstrating a signifcant correlation with shorter 
transplant-free survival for GP2 autoAbs. GP2 IgA was 
the only independent predictor for liver transplantation 
after adjusting for Mayo risk score with a hazard ratio of 
4.69. Another intriguing fnding was the correlation of 
GP2 IgA occurrence with elevated levels of secretory IgA 
(three times the normal value) which could be a sign of 
an increased IgA secretion by epithelia and/or reabsorption of IgA from mucosal surfaces. In contrast, this phenomenon was not revealed for all investigated microbial 
Abs and autoAbs including ANCA [101].
In total, autoAbs to four isoforms of GP2 have been 
reported in patients with IBD [102, 103]. Tese GP2 isoforms encompass two larger and two smaller isoforms 
whereby the large and small isoforms difer in only three 
amino acids (valine–proline–arginine) [64]. Intriguingly, 
autoAbs to all four GP2 isoforms, which were expressed 
as glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored membrane molecules in a human cell line, could be determined by IFA in patients with PSC from four European 
university hospitals [104]. Combined testing for IgA to 
GP2 isoforms 1 (large isoform) and 4 (small isoform) 
was superior to the analysis of autoAbs to just one GP2 
isoform and resulted in a sensitivity of 66% in the 212 
patients with PSC [104]. AutoAbs to GP2 isoforms 1 and 
4 were independent risk predictors for the severity of 

Lopens et al. Autoimmun Highlights (2020) 11:6 Page 6 of 14
disease (occurrence of cirrhosis) after adjusting for age 
and gender [104].
In summary, GP2 seems to function as a unique 
autoantigenic target in CD and in PSC. Given the close 
link with disease severity and carcinogenesis, IgA to GP2 
and its isoforms have the potential to become accepted as 
pathognomonic and predictive for PSC. It remains to be 
shown what additional diagnostic or even prognostic role 
PR3 autoAbs can play in the serology of PSC.
GP2 as an autoantigenic target in PSC—indication 
of microbial involvement?
Te novel autoantigenic target in PSC, GP2, is not 
organ-specifc nor is the PR3-AutoAb. In this context it 
is interesting to note that the much debated controversy 
on the expression of CD-specifc autoantigenic targets 
in extraintestinal organs (pancreas or oral cavity) and 
not at the site of infammation in the gut could only be 
overcome for GP2 [58, 105]. Elevated transcription of 
GP2 mRNA and translation of GP2 being a 78 kDa GPIanchored molecule with N-linked carbohydrates in intestinal biopsy samples was only shown for patients with CD 
in contrast to patients with UC [58]. Unlike for GP2, evidence for the expression of the other PAb target CUZD1 
in the intestine and a possible immunomodulating role 
thereof is still lacking [106].
In earlier studies, GP2 was identifed as the major 
pancreatic zymogen granule membrane protein with 
an assumed but non-confrmed role in zymogen granula formation [107–112]. Tus, the discovery of GP2 as 
microbiome-sensing receptor for particularly FimH-positive bacteria on microfold (M) cells of the intestinal follicle-associated epithelium (FAE) fundamentally changed 
the understanding of GP2’s physiological role [113, 114]. 
Peyer’s patches (PP) harbouring M cells and located in 
the epithelium covering MALT of the small intestine play 
a pivotal role in intestinal immune responses [115]. Along 
with the Ets transcription factor Spi-B, GP2 is a specifc 
marker of mature M cells characterized by high up-take 
activity of luminal components [116, 117]. Active infammation in CD has been shown in intestinal PP which 
are even regarded as potential sites of the infammatory 
onset [118–120]. Tere is growing evidence that intestinal dysbiosis in connection with an impaired intestinal 
immune response has a relevance to the development of 
autoimmune disorders [115]. In line with this assumption, an elevated risk for the onset of CD after gastrointestinal infections has been reported [121].
In this context, GP2’s modulating role of innate and 
adaptive immune responses by sensing microbiota and 
regulating intestinal anti-microbial immune responses is 
quite remarkable [122–126]. Te unique expression profle of GP2 in mucous glands of the upper digestive tract 
and pancreas as well as on intestinal M cells suggests a 
physiological balance in regard to the binding of FimHpositive bacteria by secreted (soluble) and membranebound GP2 in the gut [62]. High levels of adhesive E. 
coli which can target human PP via long polar fmbriae 
and point mutations in their FimH amino acid sequences 
were linked with CD [127–129]. Interestingly, a reduced 
GP2 presence on microbial surfaces in the intestine of 
CD patients has been reported, indicating a disturbed 
balance between soluble and membrane-bound variants 
of GP2 in CD infammation [51, 62]. Furthermore, the 
association of loss of tolerance to GP2 with the appearance of de novo CD-like infammation in patients with 
pouchitis supports the involvement of a disturbed interaction of GP2 with microbiota in the onset of CD [79, 
130]. Tis fnding is remarkable since an initial UC-specifc infammatory environment switched to a CD-like 
one with autoimmunity to GP2 occurring presumably 
due to the new microbiota composition in the pouch 
after colon resection. Tis alludes to a pathogenic role 
of GP2 autoAbs particularly of the IgA isotype. Tus, an 
inadequate immune response to an infectious agent or 
dysbiotic microbiota may trigger infammatory processes 
involving autoimmunity against M-cell receptors like 
GP2.
With regard to liver autoimmunity, loss of tolerance 
to similar surface receptors such as the hepatocyte-specifc asialoglycoprotein receptor interacting also with 
potential pathogens or their components has been demonstrated in patients with AIH and PSC recently [131, 
132]. Alike ASGPR autoAbs in AIH, GP2 autoAbs are 
closely associated with the severity of disease in patients 
with PSC. However, hitherto there is no report on the 
presence of GP2 in the biliary tract. Tus, autoimmune 
processes in the FAE of the gut could be responsible for 
triggering or perpetuating pathophysiological changes 
in the biliary tract in the context of the extensively discussed gut-liver axis.
Putative role of GP2 IgA in the pathophysiology 
of PSC
Given the association of both GP2 IgG and IgA to the 
fbrostenosing subtype and the severity of CD, it is quite 
remarkable that only IgA to GP2 has been linked with the 
clinical phenotype and severity in PSC. Of note, dimeric 
GP2 IgA like most of the IgA secreted by mucosal plasma 
cells could be actively transported by epithelial cells 
onto mucosal surfaces as has been shown for GP2 IgA in 
pouchitis patients with de novo CD [79]. Tus, GP2 IgA 
might interact with bacteria coated with GP2 of pancreatic origin in the intestine and further cross-link it with 
the GPI-anchored GP2 on M cells due to its dimeric 
nature. Tat would support the up-take of particularly 

Lopens et al. Autoimmun Highlights (2020) 11:6 Page 7 of 14
FimH-positive microbes by M cells and could enhance 
the transcytosis of potentially pathogenic adherent bacteria and subsequently infammatory processes in the intestinal mucosa [62]. If such a vicious cycle of perpetuating 
infammation could be established for the biliary tract in 
PSC remains to be shown (Fig.  1). It would require the 
secretion of GP2 into the bile by exocrine glands such as 
periductal mucous glands and the presence of pathogenic 
microbes in the bile. Oral, respiratory and genital mucus 
glands have been demonstrated to secret GP2 in mice 
apart from the pancreas as the main source of intestinal 
GP2 [105]. GP2 was also identifed as a major component 
of pancreatic intraductal plugs in chronic pancreatitis 
which resembled hyaline casts containing uromodulin, a 
renal GP2 homolog, in the urinary tract [133–135]. Given 
the signifcant correlation of loss of mucosal tolerance 
to GP2 to the pathophysiology of obstructive fbrotic 
changes in the biliary tract, the presence of GP2 in bile 
and its participation in gallstone formation would support a pathogenic role of GP2 IgA.
Tere is growing evidence to suggest that the biliary 
tract is not a sterile environment as previously thought 
Fig. 1 Putative pathophysiological role of mucosal autoimmunity to GP2 in PSC. After mucosal loss of tolerance to glycoprotein 2 (GP2), GP2 
IgA is actively secreted by biliary epithelial cells into bile as GP2 secretory IgA (SIgA). Simultaneously, GP2 is shed from exocrine biliary cells along 
with secretions into the bile. GP2 specifcally interacts with putative FimH-positive microbes (FimH+) and binds to GP2 SIgA. The latter could link 
the recognized microbe with GP2, membrane-bound by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor to the apical surface of biliary or intestinal 
microfold cells of the follicle-associated epithelium. M cells transcytose the GP2-microbe complex and present it to antigen-presenting cells such 
as IgA-positive (IgA+) B cells or dendritic cells (DC) of the underlying mucosa-associated immune system. Subsequently, IgA+ B cells including 
GP2-reactive cells are triggered which diferentiate directly or by CD4-positive T-helper cells (CD4+ Th) assistance into immunosuppressive 
IgA-secreting plasma cells (IgA+ PC) shedding interleukin 10 (IL10) and programmed cell-death 1 ligand (PD1-L). The latter two are considered 
suppressors of tumor-surveillance components such as cytotoxic CD8− positive T cells (CD8+ Tc). Taken together, this hypothetical vicious cycle 
suggests a new pathogenic mechanism for antibodies encompassing features of types 2 and 3 of hypersensitive immune reactions in accordance 
with the classifcation of Coombs and Gell by involving microbiota (coloured oval area). (Adapted according to [62])

Lopens et al. Autoimmun Highlights (2020) 11:6 Page 8 of 14
[136, 137]. A possible involvement of the microbiota in 
PSC could also be supported by the identifcation of a 
genetic polymorphism linked with PSC as well as CD 
that generated a dysfunctional fucusyltransferase-2 
(FUT2) [138, 139]. Tese FUT2 variants appear to 
afect carbohydrate metabolism in the gut and consequently infuence the microbiome. In this context, a 
reduced diversity particularly in the Firmicutes and 
Bacteriodetes phyla has been found in IBD [140–144]. 
A diminished content of the frmicute Faecalibacterium 
prausnitzii was linked with an elevated risk of postoperative recurrence of ileal CD [145]. Butyrate producing bacteria seem to have an anti-infammatory efect 
in CD. In PSC, clinical trials demonstrated a benefcial 
efect of antibiosis on liver enzyme levels [146]. Te 
aetiology of PSC does not appear to be associated with 
specifc changes in biliary microbial communities [136]. 
However, the genus Streptococcus is considered to play 
a putative role in the progression of PSC.
Finally, an elevated secretion and re-absorption of 
secretory IgA was reported in patients with PSC [52]. 
Te majority of GP2 IgA in the serum of CD patients 
bears a secretory piece [101]. Tis indicates that this 
particular GP2 IgA was secreted onto mucosal surfaces 
and later re-adsorbed. Indeed, GP2 IgA was detected 
in faeces of patients with CD-like infammation which 
supports the active secretion of GP2 IgA into the intestinal lumen in such conditions [79, 130].
Hence, it is tempting to speculate that GP2 as microbiota-sensing receptor and the ensuing mucosal loss 
of tolerance are not only involved in the pathophysiology of CD, but also in that of PSC (Fig. 1). It would 
provide the basis for a new pathogenic mechanism of 
antibody reaction which encompasses features of second and third types of Coombs and Gell classifcation 
of hypersensitive immune responses but requires the 
involvement of the microbiota [147]. Te reports of elevated GP2 IgA in patients with active celiac disease and 
particularly refractory variants thereof further support 
such assumption [73–75].
In CD, GP2 IgA aside from GP2 IgG has been linked 
with fbrotic changes in several studies whereas only 
GP2 IgA was associated with severity in PSC (Table 1). 
Concentric fbrosis of the intra- and extrahepatic bile 
tracts is the pathophysiological hallmark of PSC. In 
spite of the impressive number of clinical studies on the 
link of GP2 autoAbs with fbrosis, it remains to be demonstrated if the autoimmune hypothesis on the induction or perpetuation of mucosal infammation in PSC 
and CD holds true.
Te close association of GP2 IgA with tumorigenesis 
in PSC is another intriguing point regarding a putative pathophysiological role of GP2 IgA. Te two main 
precursor lesions of cholangiocarcinoma are biliary 
intraepithelial neoplasia and intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct [148].
In general, the intestinal mucosa harbours the largest 
population of immunoglobulin-secreting plasma cells 
in humans, shedding daily several grams of IgA. Tis 
exceeds the production of all other immunoglobulin subtypes in the human body [149]. IgA-positive plasma cells 
have been shown to secret immunosuppressive interleukins (IL) such as IL10 and programmed cell death 1 
ligand (PD1L) [150]. Plasma cells in the biliary mucosa 
have been considered as the likely source of most of 
the locally synthesized IgA that is secreted into human 
hepatic bile [151]. Remarkably, non-alcoholic fatty liver 
disease in mice and humans is linked with the accumulation of liver-resident IgA-secreting cells which express 
PD-L1 and IL10 [150]. Tese cells can directly suppress 
liver cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes and, thus, foster 
the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma. A similar scenario could be assumed for neoplastic changes in 
PSC with autoreactive IgA positive plasma cells as a key 
player.
Tus, in terms of a putative pathogenic role of the 
mucosal loss of tolerance to GP2 in PSC, the above mentioned fndings give rise to the following questions:
1. Does secretory GP2 IgA enhance the up-take of 
pathogenic microbes which in turn further trigger 
the generation of plasma cells secreting IgA autoAbs?
2. Is GP2 secreted into the bile by exocrine glands?
3. Is there a specifc microbe in the bile which can interact with GP2?
4. Are GP2 IgA-positive plasma cells abundant in the 
biliary mucosa in patients with PSC?
5. Do GP2 IgA-positive plasma cells have an immunosuppressive phenotype fostering neoplasia and 
impacting the immune surveillance of tumor cells?
Summary
Te putative pathogenic role of PSC-specifc (auto)
Abs has not yet been addressed by appropriate studies. 
Tere is an urgent need to shed a light on the yet unresolved pathophysiological role of autoimmunity in PSC, 
associated IBD and fnally carcinogenesis to provide 
more efective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. 
We assume that mucosal autoimmunity to GP2 could 
be a promising candidate to demonstrate active involvement of autoimmune responses based on an intestinal 
or biliary dysbiosis in the pathophysiology of PSC. Glycoprotein 2 appears to be a unique autoantigenic target 
in PSC. Tus, GP2 has been shown (i) to be discharged 
by mucus glands into the digestive tract, (ii) to interact

may improve the diagnosis and prognosis of the illness.
