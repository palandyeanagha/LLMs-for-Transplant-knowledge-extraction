Preoperative hyponatremia is associated with an increased risk of mortality on the liver transplantation 
(LT) waiting list. We sought to investigate the impact of pre- and intraoperative serum sodium levels on 
the one-year mortality after LT. We identifed 1,164 patients for whom preoperative and intraoperative 
serum sodium levels were available. Cox regression analysis with multivariable adjustment was 
performed for one-year mortality. A propensity score matching analysis was performed for preoperative 
and intraoperative serum sodium groups to compare one-year survival. The cutof of sodium level 
with minimal p-value was 130 mEq/L for both preoperative and intraoperative sodium. Intraoperative 
hyponatremia was an independent predictor of one-year mortality in the multivariable Cox regression 
analysis, while preoperative hyponatremia was not. Kaplan-Meier curve showed that there was a 
signifcant diference in the one-year mortality between preoperative and intraoperative serum 
sodium groups. However, after propensity score matching, there was no diference in the one-year 
mortality among the preoperative sodium groups, while there was a signifcant diference among the 
intraoperative sodium groups. Intraoperative hyponatremia defned by mean sodium <130 mEq/L 
was independently associated with a signifcantly high one-year mortality. Mean intraoperative serum 
sodium levels may be a better prognostic predictor than preoperative serum sodium levels.
Hyponatremia is a common yet ominous sign in patients with end-stage liver disease (ESLD)1,2
. Almost half of 
the patients with cirrhosis have serum sodium concentrations below the lower limit of the normal range (<135 
mEq/L)3
. Hyponatremia in patients with ESLD is associated with increased mortality independently of other 
indicators of liver disease severity such as the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score2,4–10. Also, preoperative hyponatremia of <130 mEq/L was associated with decreased post-liver transplantation (LT) survival11,12. 
Meanwhile, several studies also reported no signifcant association between preoperative hyponatremia and postoperative mortality13–15. Furthermore, there was no diference in the 6-month survival rate between those for 
whom MELD-Na score was used for liver allocation and those for whom the standard MELD score was used16. 
Terefore, the association of preoperative hyponatremia with postoperative mortality continue to be debated.
Additionally, the impact of intraoperative hyponatremia on post-LT mortality has not been evaluated. A previous retrospective study reported that a larger increase in serum sodium concentration afer surgery compared 
to preoperative baseline concentrations was associated with worse recipient short-term outcomes17. However, 
in this study, the impact of intraoperative hyponatremia during transplantation surgery was not evaluated. 
Intraoperative hyponatremia may be more closely related to the posttransplant outcomes than preoperative 
hyponatremia because the intraoperative serum sodium fuctuates more due to administration of a large amount 
of fuid, sodium bicarbonate, and diuretics. During surgery, frequent preload change occurs by clamping of inferior vena cava and bleeding and metabolic acidosis develops during anhepatic and reperfusion of liver graf. 
Terefore, these signifcant change in sodium homeostasis during surgery may be more strongly associated with 
postoperative mortality compared to preoperative serum sodium levels.
Additionally, among the studies reporting the impact of hyponatremia on mortality in patients with ESLD, the 
level of serum sodium used to defne hyponatremia does not seem to be standardized. Hyponatremia in patients

with decompensated cirrhosis was defned as a serum sodium level <130 mEq/L in previous studies2,18, although 
the lower limit of normal serum sodium is 135 mEq/L. Accordingly, many studies use <130 mEq/L to defne 
hyponatremia11,12,14, while other studies still use <135 mEq/L as a cutof of hyponatremia13,19. However, there 
have been no studies that attempted to fnd optimal cutof of serum sodium that is associated with increased risk 
of post-LT mortality.
Terefore, in this study, we attempted to conduct a retrospective observational study (1) to address whether 
preoperative and intraoperative hyponatremia during LT are associated with diminished post-LT survival and (2) 
to fnd the optimal cutof of preoperative and intraoperative serum sodium concentration that is associated with 
poor posttransplant survival.
Results
Recipient characteristics. A fow diagram showing the inclusion of participants in the study and the results 
of propensity score matching are shown in Supplemental Fig. S1. Tere were 1180 primary transplant recipients 
who met the inclusion criteria. Patients who were hypernatremic (mean pre- or intraoperative sodium ≥145 
mEq/L) were excluded from the fnal analysis (n=16) due to the low incidence. Patient characteristics are compared between the patients with mean intraoperative sodium level <130 mEq/L and those with mean intraoperative sodium levels of 130–145 mEq/L in Table 1. Tis cutof was determined according to the minimal p-value 
approach described later. Te distribution of sodium levels is shown in Supplemental Fig. S2. Preoperative 
sodium levels were less than 130 mEq/L in 221 patients (19.0%) and mean intraoperative sodium values were 
less than 130 mEq/L in 338 patients (29.0%). Te median (interquartile range) of preoperative sodium was 137 
mEq/L (132–141), and those of mean intraoperative sodium was 134 mEq/L (129–137). Tere were signifcant 
diferences in the baseline medical conditions and intraoperative variables between the intraoperative sodium 
groups. Patients with intraoperative hyponatremia (<130 mEq/L, n=338, 29.0%) had frequent diabetes mellitus, 
frequent alcoholic liver cirrhosis, lower preoperative hemoglobin level, lower albumin level, higher MELD score, 
higher Child classifcation, longer cold ischemic time, frequent red blood cell and fresh frozen plasma transfusion 
than those with mean serum sodium between 130 and 145 mEq/L.
Association between intraoperative sodium and mortality. To evaluate the cutof of pre- and intraoperative sodium levels that is associated with one-year mortality, the minimal p-value approach was used. Te 
results of serial multivariable Cox regression analyses according to the diferent cutofs of pre- and intraoperative 
serum sodium are shown in Table 2 (for one-year mortality). Mean intraoperative sodium <130 mEq/L showed 
the least p-value (p=0.006) and the largest hazard ratio (HR 2.34, 95% confdence interval [CI], 1.32–4.11). 
Preoperative serum sodium <130 was signifcantly associated with one-year mortality (HR 1.36, 95% CI 1.02–
1.87, p=0.044).
Using the cutof of 130 mEq/L of pre- and intraoperative hyponatremia, both preoperative and intraoperative hyponatremia was entered into the multivariable Cox regression analysis for one-year mortality and logistic 
regression analysis for in-hospital mortality. Te result of Cox regression analysis is shown in Table 3. Harrell’s 
c was 0.75 and Somer’s D was 0.55. Preoperative serum sodium <130 mEq/L was not independently associated 
with one-year all-cause mortality, while intraoperative mean sodium <130 mEq/L was independently associated with one-year mortality (adjusted Hazard ratio 2.34, 95% confdence interval [CI] 1.32–4.11). Te results of 
logistic regression analysis are shown in Supplemental Table S1. Intraoperative serum sodium <130 mEq/L was 
independently associated with in-hospital mortality, while preoperative hyponatremia was not.
Mean intraoperative serum sodium and Post-LT Survival. Te median follow-up afer LT was 365 
days (interquartile range, 365-365 days). 112 (9.6%) of the 1164 patients (9.6%) died in-hospital, and 132 patients 
(11.3%) died within one year afer LT. Figures 1 and 2 illustrates patient survival up to one year afer LT before 
and afer propensity score matching. It is apparent that there is a signifcant diference in the survival between 
both preoperative and intraoperative hyponatremic (<130 mEq/L) and normonatremic (130–145 mEq/L) 
patients, suggesting the survival of hyponatremic patients to be signifcantly shorter (preoperative: Log-rank test, 
p=0.0017, chi-square=9.8; intraoperative: Log-rank test, p<0.0001, chi-square=26.5). However, afer propensity score matching, there was a signifcant diference in survival between only the intraoperative sodium groups 
(Log-rank test, p=0.023, chi-square=9.28), while not between the preoperative sodium groups (Log-rank test, 
p=0.520, chi-square=0.41).
Table 4 shows the comparison of the secondary clinical outcomes afer liver transplantation according to the 
intraoperative mean sodium groups. Tere were signifcant diferences in the incidence of postoperative hemodialysis, length of intensive care unit and hospital stay. Table 5 shows the comparison of the cause of death during 
one year afer transplantation according to the intraoperative mean sodium groups. Te incidences of hepatic 
failure, recurred hepatocellular carcinoma and renal failure were signifcantly higher in the hyponatremia group 
than the normonatremia group.
Supplemental Figure S3 shows the results of the Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis according to frst intraoperative serum sodium groups (Na<130 mEq/L and 130≤Na≤145 mEq/L) before and afer propensity score 
matching. Tere were signifcant diferences between the sodium groups before and afer matching.
Discussion
We investigated the association between preoperative and intraoperative serum sodium levels and one-year 
all-cause mortality afer liver transplantation. Te main fnding of our analysis was that intraoperative serum 
hyponatremia defned as <130 mEq/L was an independent predictor of one-year mortality afer adjustment of 
MELD score and other perioperative covariates of the severity of illness. Tis cutof was determined according 
to the minimal p-value approach. Although preoperative hyponatremia was also associated with poor one-year

survival, the association was not signifcant afer propensity score matching and was not an independent predictor of one-year mortality in the multivariable Cox regression analysis. Terefore, our data indicated that intraoperative hyponatremia determined by a mean value<130 mEq/L may be a stronger prognostic factor that is 
associated with one-year mortality afer liver transplantation.
It has gained consensus that preoperative hyponatremia adversely affects the survival of end-stage liver 
patients, including those on the LT wait list. However, the impact of preoperative hyponatremia on post-LT survival has been debated. While several studies reported a signifcant association between preoperative hyponatremia and decreased short-term post-LT survival11,12, other studies reported no impact of preoperative

hyponatremia on survival13,14. A recent large retrospective study of 47,254 patients who underwent LT in the 
United States reported no association of preoperative hyponatremia and 90-day mortality afer LT15.
We hypothesized that the mean intraoperative serum sodium levels may be signifcantly and independently 
associated with one-year posttransplant mortality. As shown in our results, the intraoperative serum sodium 
levels tended to be lower than the preoperative value. Despite frequent metabolic acidosis during surgery and 
sodium bicarbonate administration, a large amount of crystalloid and colloid administration by hemodynamic 
derangement during surgery may lead to dilutional hyponatremia. Also, the amount of fuid administration tend 
to be excessive before declamping of inferior vena cava, and diuretics used to treat fuid overload may also contribute to intraoperative hyponatremia. Tis frequent and severe hyponatremia during surgery may be strongly 
associated with postoperative mortality than preoperative hyponatremia.
Tere could be another explanation for the strong association between intraoperative hyponatremia and postoperative mortality. First, the preoperative serum sodium levels investigated in previous studies were obtained 
at a single time point with varied interval from the time of transplantation9,13,15,19. Preoperative sodium levels 
obtained in our study was also from a single measurement in most of the cases. Meanwhile, intraoperative serum 
sodium levels were obtained during standardized pre-specifed time points during surgery in our study. Mean 
sodium levels calculated from eight intraoperative values contain information of sodium homeostasis during the 
surgery including the important periods of graf anastomosis and reperfusion. Mean sodium levels may refect 
the overall status of sodium homeostasis during LT with high validity. Second, although preoperative serum 
sodium concentration may vary depending on the factors including intravascular volume status and the amount 
of administered diuretics at the time of measurements, previous studies did not extensively adjust the potential 
covariates through propensity score matching14–17. Adjustment of many confounding factors may have revealed 
the more strong association between intraoperative sodium levels and mortality.
It is not clear whether the association between serum sodium and mortality is attributable to hyponatremia 
per se or if it simply refects the fact that patients with poorly maintained serum sodium concentration during 
the transplantation surgery tend to have a baseline and operation-related characteristics that are related to poor 
patient survival. Hyponatremia is associated with hepatorenal syndrome, ascites, and mortality from liver disease20–22. Our analysis of the cause of death during one year afer transplantation showed that the incidence of 
hepatic failure and renal failure were signifcantly higher in the patients with intraoperative hyponatremia, which

was the same in the propensity score-matched cohort. Tis means that intraoperative hyponatremia may be 
associated with the prognosis of liver graf and risk of postoperative renal failure. Furthermore, our sensitivity 
analysis of frst intraoperative sodium groups showed that there was a signifcant diference in survival between 
groups. Tis diference was also observed afer propensity score matching. Tis result supports the hypothesis 
that the intraoperative sodium levels may be more important to predict one-year mortality than the preoperative 
serum sodium level.
Specifcally, intraoperative hyponatremia is associated with postoperative central pontine myelinolysis that 
could infuence the overall mortality23. More patients in the intraoperative hyponatremia group developed 
osmotic demyelination syndrome than normonatremia group. Te comparison of baseline characteristics of our 
study population according to mean intraoperative sodium levels showed signifcant diferences in the baseline 
medical status of patients. Te patients with mean hyponatremia had higher MELD scores, received large crystalloid infusions and had more frequent intraoperative transfusions. Although these covariates were adjusted

to evaluate the association and were mated using propensity score, our results may have been biased by other 
unknown or unmeasured baseline and intraoperative characteristics.
To our knowledge, there is no previous study that reported the prognostic value of mean intraoperative serum 
sodium. A previous small retrospective study of 164 patients evaluated the infuence of a change in serum sodium 
afer surgery on the clinical outcomes afer LT17. Tey compared 30-day and one-year mortality according to 
the delta sodium, a diference between pre- and postoperative serum sodium levels. A larger increase in serum 
sodium was associated with prolonged intubation time, and ICU stay, but not mortality.
Te present study has several important limitations. First, this was a single-center retrospective study of a 
relatively small sample size. Our data showed that intraoperative serum sodium levels tend to become lower than 
the preoperative value during transplantation surgery. Tis may be because the patients become sicker at the time 
of transplant and/or fuid administration during anesthesia induction may cause hemodilution and a decrease in 
serum sodium concentration. With the same sample size, the more frequent intraoperative hyponatremia may 
be strongly associated with mortality compared to preoperative hyponatremia. Second, our data came from the 
institutional database of more than ten years. Te policy of administrating colloid, sodium bicarbonate or diuretics, and the choice of the type of main crystalloid solution may have changed over this extended period. Tird, 
the clinical implication of our fnding of an association between intraoperative hyponatremia and mortality is 
uncertain. A recent study reported that patients with hyponatremia corrected before LT had no survival beneft 
compared with the patients with normal sodium homeostasis14. However, little is known about how the correction of intraoperative hyponatremia afects long-term outcomes afer LT, except the risk of rapid correction of 
hyponatremia.
In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that intraoperative hyponatremia independently predicts 
one-year mortality afer LT, while preoperative hyponatremia did not. Te cutof of hyponatremia during LT was 
determined to be 130 mEq/L according to the minimal p-value approach. Intraoperative mean serum sodium 
levels may have prognostic value independent of other predictors of patient survival.
Methods
Data source. Tis retrospective observational study was approved by the institutional review board of Seoul 
National University Hospital (1803-096-930). All methods were carried out in accordance with the approved 
guidelines. Te need for informed consent was waived given the study’s retrospective design. We retrospectively 
reviewed the prospectively collected liver transplantation data base of our institution of 1211 consecutive adult 
patients (≥18 years old) who underwent liver transplantation for the frst time at our institution between January 
2005 and December 2015. Patients who did not have preoperative or intraoperative serum sodium concentrations 
reported (n=31) were excluded. Te remaining 1180 patients were included.
Anesthesia, Surgical technique and immunosuppression. During the study period, organs 
for non-living related transplant were allocated according to the policy of Korea Network for Organ Sharing 
(KONOS). According to the rules of KONOS, organs are allocated according to the grading of emergency. Te 
grade of emergency ranges from 1 to 5. Te emergency grade 1 is determined when fulminant hepatic failure 
develops in a patient admitted in the intensive care unit with more than one of the following conditions including 
ventilator therapy, hemodialysis and prolonged prothrombin time: international normalized ratio (>2.0). Te 
grade 1 is determined regardless of the MELD score. Te emergency grades 2 to 5 is determined according to the 
MELD score: grade 2 (MELD 38 to 40), grade 3 (MELD 31 to 37), grade 4 (MELD 21 to 30), grade 5 (MELD<20).
Te anesthesia protocol of our institution during the study period was as follows. Anesthesia was induced with 
propofol and rocuronium, and was maintained with sevofurane and remifentanil. Volume controlled ventilation 
was maintained with a tidal volume of 6–8 ml/kg and a FiO2 of 0.5. Radial and femoral arterial pressures were 
continuously monitored. A Swan-Ganz catheter was inserted through a 9 Fr Advanced Venous Access catheter 
(Edward Lifesciences, Irvine, CA) that was placed into the right internal jugular vein. Continuous cardiac index 
and right ventricle-associated variables were monitored using the Vigilance II monitor (Edward Lifesciences, 
Irvine, CA). Ephedrine and continuous infusion of dopamine and/or norepinephrine and/or epinephrine were 
used to maintain hemodynamics according to the monitored cardiac index, mixed venous oxygen saturation,

and systemic vascular resistance. Donor grafs were prepared with histidine–tryptophan–ketoglutarate solution. 
Te piggyback technique was used to anastomose the graf and donor vessels. End-to-end anastomosis of the 
hepatic artery and duct-to-duct anastomosis of the bile duct were carried out in succession. During the surgery, 
immunosuppression was induced with 1000 mg methylprednisolone (Solumedrol, Pfzer, Ballerup, Denmark) 
and 20mg basiliximab I.V. (Simulect, Novartis Pharma B.V., Arnhem, Netherlands). Intraoperative diuretics of 
furosemide 10 to 20 mg were used in patients with persistent positive fuid balance and when volume overload 
was suspected with pulmonary artery occlusion pressure being greater than 18mmHg. Sodium bicarbonate of 
40ml was administered when base excess was less than −10 mEq/L. Vasopressin was not used intraoperatively 
during the study period.
Data collection. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data at the time of LT were extracted from our liver 
transplantation database including MELD score and underlying liver disease diagnoses. Preoperative serum 
sodium levels measured within one month before transplantation were collected. If there were more than one 
measurements of serum sodium during the month before surgery, the average value was used for preoperative 
serum sodium. Mean intraoperative serum sodium levels were calculated as an average of the following eight values routinely measured according to our anesthesia protocol of our institution: afer anesthesia induction, 1hour 
afer anesthesia induction, 10min afer the beginning of the anhepatic phase, 5min before and afer graf reperfusion, 20min afer reperfusion, 5min afer the start of biliary reconstruction, and at the end of surgery. All perioperative and intraoperative serum sodium levels were corrected for hyperglycemia24. Hyperglycemia-corrected 
serum sodium levels were used to classify and match the diferent sodium groups.
Te primary outcome variable was one-year all-cause mortality afer liver transplantation. Secondary outcomes included in-hospital mortality, the incidence of osmotic demyelination syndrome, length of ICU and hospital stay, and the incidence of postoperative renal replacement therapy. Patient survival was calculated as the 
interval between LT and the last known follow-up or death.
Data analysis. SPSS sofware version 23.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) and STATA/MP version 15.1 
(StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) were used to analyze the data. For all analyses, P<0.05 was considered 
statistically signifcant. Te Shapiro-Wilk test was used to determine the normality of the data.
First, we determined the appropriate serum sodium cutof level that is associated with posttransplant all-cause 
1-yr mortality. A minimal p-value approach was used to determine the cutof of sodium levels with a range of 
120 to 140 mEq/L. We did not evaluate cutof >140 because we intended to fnd the cutof of hyponatremia. 
Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were performed using diferent cutofs for both preoperative and intraoperative serum sodium, separately. Cox regression analyses included the following covariates 
that may be associated with postoperative mortality: living versus deceased donor, recipient age, sex, body-mass 
index, history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, preoperative diuretics administration, hepatorenal syndrome, 
cold-ischemic time, warm ischemic time, MELD score, graf-recipient body weight ratio, ABO-incompatibility 
transplantation, preoperative lef ventricular ejection fraction, operation time, red blood cell transfusion during 
surgery, intraoperative mean blood glucose, preoperative hemoglobin and preoperative albumin.
Second, we attempted to evaluate the association between preoperative and mean intraoperative sodium levels 
and postoperative in-hospital and one-year mortality. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed 
for in-hospital mortality, while multivariable Cox regression analysis was performed for one-year mortality. Both 
analyses included the same covariates listed above and also included preoperative and intraoperative hyponatremia using the cutof determined by the above analysis.
Tird, a propensity score matching analysis was performed between hyponatremia and normonatremia 
groups for both preoperative and intraoperative serum sodium levels using the cutofs determined by the minimal p-value approach. Tis analysis was performed to reduce any confounding factors that contribute to the 
postoperative morality. Afer propensity score matching, the survival between the diferent sodium groups and 
the secondary outcomes variables were compared between the matched groups using the Kaplan-Meier curve. 
Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to determine the probabilities of hyponatremia and normonatremia group assignment, which was used for matching. Te following covariates were considered for the propensity score matching: living versus deceased donor transplantation, recipient age, sex, body-mass index, history 
of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, preoperative diuretics administration, hepatorenal syndrome, cold-ischemic 
time, warm ischemic time, MELD score, graf-recipient body weight ratio, ABO-incompatibility transplantation, 
preoperative lef ventricular ejection fraction, operation time, red blood cell transfusion during surgery, intraoperative mean blood glucose, preoperative hemoglobin and preoperative albumin.
Patients were matched 1:1 using a greedy nearest neighbor algorithm with a caliper of 0.1 standard deviations 
of the logit-transformed propensity score. A total of 428 patients were matched in the preoperative serum sodium 
groups while 658 patients were matched between the two intraoperative serum sodium groups (Supplemental 
Figs S4 and S5). Te Nagelkerke’s R2
 of regression model were 0.31 and 0.30 for preoperative and intraoperative 
matching, respectively. Tere was no imbalance between the matched groups (standardized diference >0.1 represents imbalance).
Fourth, a Kaplan-Meier curve analysis of one-year mortality was performed for both the preoperative and 
intraoperative serum sodium groups. Te log-rank test was used to determine statistical signifcance between the 
diferent serum sodium groups.
Fifh, as a sensitivity analysis, we evaluated the association between frst intraoperative sodium levels and 
one-year mortality. We performed a propensity score matching between frst intraoperative sodium groups. A 
Kaplan-Meier curve analysis of one-year mortality was performed between the sodium groups before and afer 
matching.

Te missingness for age, sex, body-mass index, MELD components, serum sodium, length of hospital stay, 
and mortality was 0%. Missing values of other covariates were less than 8%. We imputed the missing values 
according to the incidence of missing. If the incidence of missing was <3%, the missing was substituted by the 
mean for continuous variable and by the mode for incidence variable. Missing values of variables with a ratio of 
missing was >3% and <8% were replaced by hot-deck imputation.
