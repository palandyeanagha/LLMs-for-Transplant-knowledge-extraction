Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for takotsubo 
cardiomyopathy that developed after mitral valve 
replacement
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a transient systolic and diastolic left ventricular dysfunction 
that presents several wall-motion abnormalities, while the coronary artery shows normal 
findings. Because patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy present with symptoms similar to 
acute coronary syndrome, the initial diagnosis and treatment are often difficult. The condition 
is often precipitated by acute emotional or physical stress and frequently occurs in postmenopausal women. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy may also occur in the perioperative period after 
cardiac and noncardiac surgery; surgery-associated Takotsubo cardiomyopathy reportedly 
accounts for 3%–23% of all cases. Of these perioperative cases, cardiothoracic surgery accounted 
for 16%. However, few cases have been reported in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and 
managed with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). We report a case of Takotsubo 
cardiomyopathy managed with ECMO in a patient in the intensive care unit after mitral valve 
replacement.

Acute and Critical Care
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a transient systolic and diastolic left ventricular dysfunction involving various wall-motion abnormalities, while the coronary artery shows normal findings 
[1]. The name was first described in the Japanese literature in 1990 and derived from the shape 
of a Japanese ceramic pot (called a takotsubo); it describes the unique pattern of the left ventricle, characterized by apical ballooning and a hyperkinetic base. It is often precipitated by 
acute emotional or physical stress and frequently occurs in women in the postmenopausal 
period. This disease is also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy, Takotsubo syndrome, 
apical ballooning syndrome, or broken heart syndrome. It typically improves within 3 to 6 
months. Although several hypotheses have been proposed for the etiology, catecholamineinduced microvascular dysfunction is now the most widely accepted cause [2].
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy may occur in the perioperative period after cardiac and noncardiac surgery. However, few cases have been reported in patients who have undergone cardiac surgery and were managed with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). We 
report a case of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy managed with ECMO that occurred in a patient 
in the intensive care unit (ICU) after mitral valve replacement.

CASE REPORT
A 52-year-old woman with rheumatic heart disease and atrial 
fibrillation was scheduled to undergo a mitral valve replacement and Maze operation for severe mitral stenosis. She had a 
history of decompressive craniectomy due to cerebral swelling and right middle cerebral artery infarction 1 year prior, 
and sequela included persistent weakness of her left side. Preoperative transthoracic echocardiography revealed normal 
left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction, 63%) and 
no regional wall motion abnormalities. Anesthesia induction 
and maintenance were performed as usual, and routine cardiac anesthesia monitoring was conducted. The mitral valve 
replacement was a 27-mm St. Jude Medical valve prosthesis 
(St. Jude Medical, Saint Paul, MN, USA), and the Maze operation proceeded well under cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). 
Myocardial protection was performed via an infusion of cold 
cardioplegia via the aortic root cannula. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography showed no paravalvular leakage. Immediately after an aortic cross clamp, the cardiac activity was converted to normal sinus rhythm but returned to 
atrial fibrillation after a few minutes. Left ventricular systolic 
function remained normal. The patient was weaned from the 
CPB. After the operation, the patient was transferred to the 
ICU. The patient’s vital signs were controlled through administration of dobutamine and norepinephrine, and tachycardia 
was controlled through amiodarone. The patient’s blood pressure was maintained at 110/60 mm Hg, and her oxygen saturation was greater than 97%. Extubation was performed the 
day after the operation. However, at 2 days postoperatively, 
the patient complained of dyspnea and chest discomfort, and 
electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed a premature ventricular 
complex. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed decreased 
left ventricular ejection fraction to 26% and akinesia of the 
middle and apical wall of the left ventricle (Figure 1). Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was suspected, but coronary artery disease could not be completely ruled out. On the 4th postoperative day, the patient developed pulmonary edema and hypoxemia. The patient’s systolic blood pressure was 80 mm Hg, and 
heart rate was 150 beats/min. The ECG showed atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. The doses of norepinephrine, dobutamine, and epinephrine were continuously 
increased. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a continuously worsening ejection fraction. The patient was intubated, 
and we decided to perform ECMO insertion because coronary angiography and management were not possible at the 
time due to the patient’s condition. The results of laboratory 
tests were as follows: creatine kinase-MB, 1.5 μg/L; troponin I, 
1.73 ng/ml; and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), 4,073 pg/ml. 
The ECG showed atrial fibrillation with ST and T wave abnormality. The QT interval was 266 ms. Vasopressor support with 
norepinephrine was continued. Coronary angiography was 
performed under ECMO, and the results were normal. Thus, 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was confirmed, and conservative 
treatment and supportive care were maintained. At 11 days 
postoperatively, the ECG showed QT prolongation (582 ms).

At 21 days postoperatively, transthoracic echocardiography 
revealed that the left ventricular ejection fraction had recovered to 38%, and the ECMO was subsequently removed. Extubation was performed at 30 days postoperatively, and the patient was transferred to the general ward at 33 days postoperatively. At 35 days postoperatively, the patient’s left ventricular 
ejection fraction had recovered to 58%. The changes in BNP 
and serum troponin I levels are shown in Figure 2.
The patient was discharged on the 60th postoperative day 
after receiving rehabilitation for left-sided weakness. One year 
after the operation at a follow-up visit, the patient was without 
any complications and medicated with digitalis, diuretics, and 
warfarin.
DISCUSSION
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is an acute and usually reversible 
heart failure syndrome. Because patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy present with symptoms similar to those seen in 
acute coronary syndrome, initial diagnosis and treatment of 
this condition are difficult. Careful examination is needed to 
confirm the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy; the condition has typical characteristics that need to be specifically 
checked. New diagnostic criteria for Takotsubo cardiomyopathy were created by the Heart Failure Association (HFA) of the 
European Society of Cardiology in 2015 [3]. The criteria are as 
follows: (1) transient regional wall-motion abnormalities, (2) 
wall-motion abnormalities typically extend beyond a single 
epicardial vascular distribution, (3) absence of atherosclerotic 
coronary artery disease, (4) new and reversible ECG abnormalities, (5) significantly elevated serum BNP or natriuretic 
peptide-proBNP during the acute phase, (6) positive but relatively small elevation in cardiac troponin, and (7) recovery of 
ventricular systolic function (3–6 months). Our patient had 
transient akinesia of the mid and apical left ventricle, normal 
coronary angiography, QT prolongation, elevated serum BNP 
and troponin levels, and recovery of left ventricular systolic 
function within 1 month. Therefore, the patient’s clinical data 
adhere to the diagnostic criteria mentioned above. However, 
ECG changes and BNP level may take 6–12 months to recover 
and may persist abnormally in some cases [1].
If a patient has at least one major risk factor or two or more 
minor risk factors among the risk factors suggested by the 
HFA, the patient is classified as a high-risk patient [3]. Our patient was classified as a high-risk patient because she had two 
major risk factors (pulmonary edema and left ventricular ejection fraction <35%) as well as two minor risk factors (QT prolongation ≥500 ms and BNP ≥600 pg/ml). Management by a 
cardiologist and ICU care are essential for treating these patients. Serious complications of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy 
include congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, and cardiogenic shock. It is reported that patients experiencing cardiogenic shock had a much higher mortality [4]. These high 
risk patients often require ventilatory support, advanced cardiovascular support, and even cardiopulmonary resuscitation. 
To the best of our knowledge, there has been no randomized 
trial to define the optimal management of patients diagnosed 
with Takotsubo syndrome. Although a number of authors favor the use of an intra-aortic balloon pump to minimize or 
avoid inotropic therapy, the expert consensus suggests that the 
use of ECMO or left ventricular assist devices for patients with 
cardiogenic shock associated with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy 
yields better outcomes [5]. In our patient, we were able to diagnose Takotsubo cardiomyopathy early using transthoracic 
echocardiography and laboratory tests. Moreover, early application of ECMO enabled rapid recovery of cardiac function.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is triggered by emotional or 
physical stress. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy associated with 
surgery is reported to account for 3%–23% of all cases, and 
cardiomyopathy developing after cardiothoracic surgery accounted for 16% of these perioperative cases [6-8]. Patients 
suffer emotional stress at the prospect of undergoing a major 
surgery, and they also experience increased catecholamines 
by direct stimulation of pain. Patients undergoing cardiac surgery are particularly vulnerable to cardiac toxicity due to catecholamines since the heart is directly stimulated during surgery. Plasma catecholamine concentration is significantly elevated in patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy compared 
to levels in patients with other cardiac conditions, such as 
acute myocardial infarction. In our case, the psychological 
stress due to ICU admission and the maintenance of supportive catecholamines after surgery could be the causes of the 
disease. In addition, there is a report that a cerebrovascular 
event is associated with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy [9]. Therefore, this patient may have had an increased risk of developing 
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy because she had a history of a 
cerebrovascular event. To prevent development of Takotsubo 
cardiomyopathy after surgery, it is important to reduce the 
psychological and physical stress on the patient through aggressive pain control and adequate sedation. An agent such as 
dexmedetomidine, which controls pain and blunts the sympathetic nervous system, may be an alternative [10].
A large retrospective study of 26 centers in the United States 
and Europe found that systolic dysfunction is classified into 
four types: apical (81.7%), midventricular (14.6%), basal (2.2%), 
and focal (1.5%) [1]. Our patient was found to have the typical 
apical type. Although the dysfunction is named Takotsubo 
due to its distinctive shape, other types of systolic dysfunctions, in addition to the typical type, should be kept in mind.
In conclusion, early diagnosis of postsurgical Takotsubo 
cardiomyopathy with echocardiography and laboratory testing is important for successful patient management. If cardiac 
function has severely deteriorated, the application of ECMO 
can enable patient recovery.
