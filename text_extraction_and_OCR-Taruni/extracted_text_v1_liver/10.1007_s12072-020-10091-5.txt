Abstract
It is a well-recognized fact that implementing new guidelines in clinical practice may be difcult; therefore the Italian Society 
for Organ and Tissue Transplantation (SITO) set out to defne practical immunosuppression tools for the management of 
liver transplantation patients. In 2017, an Italian Working Group of liver transplant experts and hepatologists issued a set 
of consensus statements along with evidence-based recommendations on the use of everolimus after liver transplantation. 
This article presents the evidence- and consensus-based algorithms developed within the Italian Working Group, which are 
aimed towards guiding clinicians in the selection of immunosuppressive regimens for the management of adult liver transplant recipients in real-life practice. The liver transplant recipient population, typically managed in clinical practice, was 
divided into the following categories: (1) standard patients; (2) critically ill patients; (3) patients with a specifc etiology; 
(4) patients with hepatocellular carcinoma; (5) and patients with de novo malignancies. The algorithms are divided into two 
parts, according to the time from transplantation (0–3 months and>3 months) and are discussed here along with relevant 
supporting literature, when available. Ultimately, it is hoped that the evidence- and consensus-based algorithms developed 
within the Italian Working Group, and presented here, contribute to simplify, personalize, and optimize immunosuppression 
of liver transplantation recipients in clinical practice.

Introduction
Despite considerable progress in solid organ transplantation 
leading to increased patient and graft survival, complications 
associated with maintenance immunosuppressive therapy 
required to prevent rejection remain a major issue [1]. In 
liver transplant recipients, for example, the chronic use of 
calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) has been shown to increase the 
risk of renal dysfunction, metabolic disorders, neurotoxicity, 
and de novo malignancies [2–8]. As an example, approximately 20% of liver transplant recipients experience chronic 
renal failure within 5 years of transplantation [7].
Consequently, extensive eforts have been devoted to 
developing strategies for reducing or withdrawing CNIs 
[9]. In this regard, the mTOR inhibitors, sirolimus, and 
everolimus have attracted considerable attention because 
of their immunosuppressive and antiproliferative properties 
[1]. Furthermore, a large body of evidence has shown that 
mTOR inhibitor-facilitated CNI reduction is associated with 
nephroprotective efects in both de novo and maintenance 
liver transplant recipients [10–14].
In 2017, an Italian Working Group, composed of senior 
representatives from Italian liver transplant centers, issued a 
set of consensus statements with evidence-based recommendations on the use of everolimus after liver transplantation 
[15]. The statements addressed four areas of practical interest: (1) kidney function; (2) timing of everolimus introduction, reduction of CNI exposure, and risk of graft rejection; 
(3) antiproliferative efect of everolimus; and (4) management of everolimus-related adverse events [15]. According 
to these recommendations, strategies for the prevention of 
renal impairment should be implemented early following 
transplantation to obtain good outcomes (typically after 
4 weeks); in addition, owing to its antiproliferative properties, everolimus is also recommended for the prevention 
of de novo malignancies and recurrence of hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC) [15].
However, the implementation of new recommendations 
is rarely a straight-forward process in real-life. Indeed, the 
multicenter, observational study SURF, which assessed the 
management of patients undergoing liver transplantation in 
Italy, has shown that most liver transplant recipients with 
chronic kidney disease are not managed according to current 
guidelines, with less than 20% being switched from standard 
CNI-based immunosuppressive regimens to renal-sparing 
alternatives [16]. In addition to the previously mentioned 
recommendations [15], a further objective of the Italian 
Working Group of transplantation experts was to identify 
practical issues not fully covered by the guidelines and to 
improve the implementation of these recommendations in 
clinical practice.
This article presents the evidence- and consensus-based 
algorithms developed within the Italian Working Group and 
aimed at guiding clinicians in the selection of immunosuppressive regimens for the management of various categories 
of adult liver transplant recipients.
Methods
This project was conceived under the auspices of the Italian Society for Organ and Tissue Transplantation (SITO) 
to defne practical immunosuppression algorithms for the 
management of adult, ABO-compatible liver transplantation 
patients and was prompted by the awareness that implementing new guidelines in clinical practice may be difcult. It was 
launched in 2017 by a group of 8 Italian expert transplant 
physicians (scientifc board), most of whom were among 
the authors of the recommendations for the use of everolimus in liver transplantation published in the same year in 
Transplantation [15]. The expertise of the scientifc board 
members was substantiated by their publication records, 
participation in national/international scientifc meetings 
and clinical trials, academic rank, and clinical experience 
in liver transplant surgery or transplant hepatology, as well 
as the use of mTOR inhibitors. With regard to everolimus 
use, it should be noted that in Italy it has been used of-label 
for liver transplantation since 2006, well before the EMA 
approval in this indication, thanks to specifc legislation and 
based on evidence from phase II clinical trials. The aim of 
this project was to produce evidence- and consensus-based 
recommendations for immunosuppressive therapy in adult 
liver transplant recipients, with a focus on clinical practice.
In 2017, the scientifc board convened in Milan to share 
and discuss the clinical experience with everolimus at their 
centers and to review the relevant literature, with the purpose 
of identifying unresolved issues and producing a standard 
protocol for immunosuppression, in line with current recommendations for everolimus use [15] and based on published 
evidence when available, clinical experience, and consensus. The scientifc board used a three-step modifed Delphi 
method for reaching consensus, as previously described [15].
In Step 1, the scientifc board convened in Milan at 
a face-to-face meeting during which it was decided to 
divide the liver transplant recipient population, typically 

932 Hepatology International (2020) 14:930–943

managed in clinical practice, in the following categories: 
(1) standard patients; (2) critically ill patients; (3) patients 
with a specifc etiology; (4) patients with HCC; (5) and 
patients with de novo malignancies. ABO-incompatible 
liver transplant patients were excluded from the target 
population due to the scarcity of such practice in Italy. 
With respect to HCC patients, previous national consensus 
conferences suggested liver transplantation for T2 patients 
(≥2 cm), whilst the upper tumor size limit or stage was left 
to the discretion of each transplant center based on donor 
graft availability and transplant beneft [17]. The scientifc board drafted immunosuppressive protocols for each 
patient category. These protocols were to be submitted for 
assessment to a panel of clinicians (consensus panel). The 
consensus panel was composed of clinicians from Italian 
liver transplant centers (21 centers were invited; 16 centers 
participated with a total of 31 representatives; names and 
afliations of clinicians are listed in Appendix A).
In Step 2, the scientifc board and consensus panel 
met in Rome at a plenary meeting. The members of the 
consensus panel were asked to express their agreement 
or disagreement on the treatment protocol proposed 
for each patient category using a Likert scale from 1 to 
5 (1, strongly disagree; 2, disagree; 3, neutral; 4 agree; 
5 strongly agree). The positive consensus was defned 
by > 70% agreement on a given protocol (expressed as 
the percentage of respondents scoring the protocol with 
either 4 or 5) [15]. A positive agreement was reached on 
all immunosuppression protocols.
The treatment algorithms presented here were fnalized 
during a fnal face-to-face meeting of the scientifc board 
held in Milan (Step 3). The algorithms have been available 
since September 2018 on the SITO website (https://www.
societaitalianatrapiantidiorgano.com/).
After a period of real-world practice, the treatment algorithms were amended and approved by the consensus panel 
at a plenary meeting held in December 2019.
Strategies for immunosuppression in liver 
transplant recipients
The algorithms for immunosuppressive therapy in adult, 
ABO-compatible liver transplant recipients, according to the 
patient category, are shown in Figs. 1–5. All algorithms are 
divided into two parts, according to the time from transplantation: 0–3 months and>3 months. General remarks on the 
algorithms are shown in Table 1 and additional comments 
concerning the diferent recommended immunosuppressive 
therapies are shown in Table 2. The algorithms are discussed 
in the following sections along with relevant supporting literature, when available.
Standard patients
Defnition/description of patient category
Low-risk patients with a Model for End-Stage Liver Disease 
(MELD) score<25 and no autoimmune disease, HCC, or 
history of renal dysfunction.
Relevant supporting evidence from the literature
Early (30±5 days post-transplant) or very early (≤10 days 
post-transplant) mTOR inhibitor introduction to reduce 
exposure to CNI has been reported to improve estimated 
glomerular fltration rate (eGFR) by 8–12 mL/min/1.73 m2
at 1 year after transplantation [15]. In the H2304 study, 
which investigated de novo use of everolimus in 719 liver 
transplant recipients who were randomized at 30±5 days 
post-transplant, the adjusted change in eGFR at 12 months 
was superior in the everolimus plus reduced tacrolimus 
group using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease 
(four-variable) (MDRD4) formula (diference of 8.5 mL/
min/1.73 m2; p<0.001) [11], and remained signifcantly 
superior at 24 months (diference of 6.7 mL/min/1.73 m2; 
p=0.002) [12] compared with the standard tacrolimusbased regimen. An extension of the H2304 study demonstrated signifcantly improved renal function preservation 
for up to 3-years post-transplantation in 282 liver transplant 
recipients receiving everolimus plus reduced tacrolimus, 
with mean eGFR decreasing from randomization to month 
36 by 7.0±31.3 mL/min/1.73 m2 versus 15.5±22.7 mL/
min/1.73 m2 in the tacrolimus-control group (p=0.005) 
[18].
In the PROTECT trial, in which 203 liver transplant 
patients were randomized at 4 weeks post-transplant to discontinue CNI therapy and start everolimus or to continue 
their current CNI-based regimen, an eGFR treatment difference of 7.8 mL/min (p=0.021) in favor of everolimus 
was identifed at 12 months after transplantation using the 
MDRD4 formula [19]. At month 35 after randomization, a 
10.1 mL/min beneft in the adjusted mean eGFR in favor of 
everolimus was identifed using the Cockcroft-Gault formula 
(p=0.082 vs. CNI), 9.4 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p=0.053) using 
the MDRD4 formula, and 9.5 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p=0.028) 
using the Nankivell formula [14].
A separate study, in which 78 liver transplant patients 
were randomized to early CNI withdrawal followed by 
everolimus as monotherapy (with the initial dose of everolimus started on day 10 after liver transplantation) or to cyclosporine, identifed a signifcant improvement in renal function at 12 months after transplantation in patients treated 
with everolimus compared with cyclosporine (mean eGFR 
values [MDRD formula] were 87.6 ± 26.1  mL/min vs. 
59.9±12.6 mL/min, respectively; p<0.001) [20].

In addition, evidence from randomized studies and 
retrospective analyses shows that the improvement in 
renal function is limited if CNI-reducing strategies 
are postponed until renal function has deteriorated 
(eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) [10, 21–23].
Summary of recommendations and expert opinion
In standard patients (Fig. 1), immunosuppression is based 
on CNIs, usually tacrolimus; cyclosporine can also be 
used. Tacrolimus monotherapy is not recommended. Early 
CNI reduction is feasible with the introduction of everolimus or mycophenolic acid derivatives, and may be further 
facilitated by the administration of induction agents (usually basiliximab for liver transplant recipients). Overall, 
a steroid-free approach is recommended.
Critically ill patients
Defnition/description of patient category
Patients with one or more of the conditions listed in Fig. 2, 
namely high MELD-Na (i.e., MELD-Na>29 or MELDNa 25–29 with concomitant renal dysfunction/dialysis or 
chronic encephalopathy), national high urgency, acute gastroesophageal bleeding, renal dysfunction/dialysis, hepatorenal syndrome, sepsis, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, 
colonization by multidrug-resistant organisms, portal thrombosis, metabolic syndrome or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, 
thoracic ascites, urinary tract infection and/or ventilatory 
support and/or inotropic support, or high surgical risk are 
considered as high-risk patients. Frail patients, with sarcopenia as a distinctive characteristic, also belong to this 
category [24–27].

Relevant supporting evidence from the literature
Studies in this patient category are lacking, as most trials enroll low-risk patients (e.g., patients with no renal 
impairment).
Summary of recommendations and expert opinion
Induction therapy (basiliximab) is recommended in these 
patients to delay the introduction of CNI to 3–5 days posttransplantation. In patients with elevated MELD-Na (>29), 
the use of induction therapy should be carefully considered; CNI should be initiated at lower doses as compared to 
standard patients. CNI monotherapy is not recommended, 
and cyclosporine is a possible alternative to tacrolimus in 
particular in patients with dysmetabolic abnormalities and 
decompensated diabetes. For CNI reduction, the available 
options include mycophenolic acid derivatives and everolimus. CNI discontinuation can be considered for patients 
with signs of CNI-induced neuro-nephrotoxicity. Everolimus is particularly indicated in patients at risk of renal 
dysfunction or with renal dysfunction confrmed by eGFR 
assessments; among these patients, those with diabetes or 
metabolic disease may particularly beneft from everolimus, as this mTOR inhibitor has cardiovascular protective 
efects beside nephroprotective properties. Hyperlipidemia

and hypertriglyceridemia, if present, can be treated before 
or after the introduction of everolimus. Proteinuria requires 
accurate renal function work-up and can be treated with 
appropriate strategies.
Patients with a specifc etiology
Defnition/description of patient category
In this group, we included less frequent or emerging indications to liver transplantation in Italy, as follows: patients 
with polycystic liver disease (PLD) with or without kidney 
involvement, patients necessitating combined liver-kidney 
transplantation, patients with autoimmune liver disease 
(AILD), patients with oncological indications to transplantation as neuroendocrine tumors (NET), metastatic colorectal cancer (metaCRC), or patients with cholangiocarcinoma 
(CCA) (Fig. 3).
Relevant supporting evidence from the literature
Two inherited disorders associated with PLD can be distinguished: isolated polycystic liver disease (PCLD) and 
autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). 
Although PCLD is not associated with excess mortality

when left untreated, the quality of life supports the choice 
of liver transplantation as a therapeutic option [28, 29].
Combined liver-kidney transplantation should be considered in patients with severe renal impairment or on renal 
replacement therapy [30, 31].
Liver transplantation for NET liver metastasis may be a 
viable treatment option in selected patients as 5-year posttransplant overall survival rates of 47–97% and disease-free 
survival rates of 32–87% have been reported [32–34]. Survival outcomes after liver transplantation are similar for liver 
transplantation performed in “ideal” candidates and for those 
with HCC [33]. However, as recurrence rates remain higher, 
immunosuppressive treatment must be appropriate to the 
oncological status.
For patients with metaCRC, the role of liver transplantation requires further elucidation and defnition by ongoing 
clinical trials and real-life practice [35]. Nonetheless, a Norwegian study of 21 patients with nonresectable colorectal 
liver metastases demonstrated a 5-year survival rate of 60% 
after liver transplantation, exceeding outcomes reported for 
chemotherapy [36]. In colorectal cancer patients with nonresectable liver-only metastases, the 5-year overall survival 
rate was 83% after liver transplantation, highlighting the 
importance of improved patient selection criteria for optimal 
survival rates [37].
CCA, the second most common liver cancer, is associated with a very poor prognosis [38]. Liver transplantation 
protocols for CCA show low survival rates, given that tumor 
size (>2 cm) and multi-nodularity are risk factors for tumor 
recurrence and worse outcomes when compared with similar 
HCCs [39]. Nevertheless, clinically acceptable results were 
obtained in selected patients who underwent neoadjuvant 
chemoradiotherapy followed by liver transplantation [40]. 
In such cases, the immunosuppressive strategy must balance 
the risk of recurrence. There is also some experimental and 
clinical evidence on the antiproliferative efect of mTOR 
inhibitors in CCA-tumor cells [41] and in clinical studies 
[42].
Summary of recommendations and expert opinion
Patients with isolated PCLD can be referred to the critical 
patient path, due to complex surgery. Patients with ADPKD 
and renal impairment and/or in renal replacement therapy 
are considered for simultaneous or delayed combined liverkidney transplantation [43, 44]. In this case, the immunosuppressive therapy is directed towards the critical patient path 
or towards the standard case path depending on the clinical 
conditions and after a careful multidisciplinary evaluation 
[30, 31].
Everolimus-facilitated CNI reduction should be implemented as early as possible, to avoid further damage to 
the kidney. In patients with oncological issues, the early 
introduction of mTOR inhibitors should be considered, and 
their use is also recommended in the case of post-transplant 
recurrence [45]. This could apply also to patients with additional risk factors for post-transplant de novo malignancy 
development (i.e. alcohol-related liver disease).
AILD should be treated with tacrolimus and corticosteroids, adjusting the latter based on efcacy and side efects; 
everolimus or mycophenolates can also be added. Cyclosporine can be used instead of tacrolimus [46], mostly in 
case of relapse.
Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma
Defnition/description of patient category
Patients undergoing liver transplantation due to HCC.
Relevant supporting evidence from the literature
Antiproliferative properties of mTOR inhibitors and data 
from the literature support the use of this drug class in HCC 
patients. A large body of preclinical and clinical evidence 
has shown that mTOR inhibitors can limit HCC recurrence 
and progression in liver transplant recipients [47–49]. Sirolimus-based immunosuppression was benefcial after liver 
transplantation with signifcantly higher patient survival 
post-transplantation for HCC in a multivariate analysis of 
2491 patients (hazard ratio 0.53, 95% confdence interval 
[CI] 0.31–0.92; p≤0.05) [48]. mTOR inhibitors were also 
associated with signifcantly lower rates of HCC recurrence 
after liver transplantation when compared with CNIs (8% 
vs. 13.8%; p<0.001) in a systematic review of 3666 HCC 
liver transplant recipients [47]. However, signifcant benefts 
of mTOR inhibitors were only observed in patients within 
Milan criteria (i.e., low-risk patients) in a prospective, randomized, phase 3 clinical trial of sirolimus-based immunosuppression in 525 HCC liver transplant recipients [50]. 
Moreover, HCC recurrence-free and overall survival benefts of mTOR inhibitors were apparent for up to 3–5 years 
post-transplantation, but were not sustained thereafter. An 
analysis of the US Scientifc Registry of Transplant Recipients suggested benefcial, albeit not statistically signifcant, 
outcomes in terms of lower rates of HCC recurrence and 
cancer-specifc mortality in recipients of liver transplantations for HCC receiving sirolimus-based immunosuppression, however, efects appeared to be modifed by patient age 
at transplantation, with better outcomes identifed for transplant recipients>55 years of age than those≤55 years [51].
For patients with recurrent HCC post-transplantation, 
evidence from retrospective analyses and case reports suggests that mTOR inhibitors should be introduced to slow 
disease progression due to their antiproliferative activity 
[52–54]. The addition of everolimus to sorafenib in a 46-year 

938 Hepatology International (2020) 14:930–943
1 3
old male who experienced HCC recurrence 11 years after 
liver transplantation led to an approximately 50% reduction in tumor size after 3-months of treatment, with further 
reductions of tumor size after 8 months [52]. In a retrospective cohort study of 31 patients with recurrent HCC after 
liver transplantation, the combined use of mTOR inhibitor 
(everolimus or sirolimus) and sorafenib identifed a median 
overall survival of 19.3 months after initiation of the combined treatment, with a median time to disease progression 
of 6.77 months [54]. In a retrospective analysis of 7 liver 
transplantation recipients with HCC recurrence who were 
switched to everolimus plus sorafenib, 5 patients were alive 
after a median follow-up of 6.5 months (interquartile range 
[IQR] 14 months), 4 patients with tumor progression; the 
median time to progression was 3.5 (IQR 12) months [53].
Compared with CNI-based immunosuppression, mTORinhibitor-based immunosuppression signifcantly increased 
recurrence-free-survival at both 1- and 3-years post-transplantation (risk ratio [RR] 1.09 and 1.1, respectively) in a 
systematic review and meta-analysis of 23 studies on the 
survival and recurrence of HCC in liver transplant recipients [55]. In addition, treatment with mTOR inhibitors conferred a signifcant survival advantage in overall survival at 
1-, 3- and 5-years post-transplant (RR: 1.07, 1.1, and 1.18, 
respectively), and a signifcantly lower rate of HCC recurrence (RR: 0.67) compared with conventional CNI-based 
immunosuppression.
Summary of recommendations and expert opinion
In all HCC patients (regardless of their risk of relapse), strategies to facilitate CNI reduction should be implemented to 
limit CNI-related renal toxicities and the impact of CNI 
exposure on cancer recurrence. Steroid-free immunosuppressive schedules are preferred (Fig. 4).
Patients with de novo malignancies
Defnition/description of patient category
Liver transplant recipients who develop de novo malignancies any time following transplantation, including extrahepatic solid tumors, non-melanoma skin cancer, and lymphoproliferative diseases.
Relevant supporting evidence from the literature
A relatively large body of evidence from studies in heart, 
kidney, and liver transplant recipients suggests that the 
use of mTOR inhibitors leads to a reduced incidence of de 
novo malignancies after solid organ transplantation [15, 56, 
57]. The incidence of de novo malignancy within 963 days 
post-transplant was signifcantly lower in patients receiving 
sirolimus/everolimus compared with cyclosporine/tacrolimus (0.60% vs. 1.81%; p<0.001) in a retrospective analysis of 33,249 kidney transplant recipients, with the risk of 
developing any de novo malignancy reduced by 60% with 
sirolimus/everolimus immunosuppression (relative risk 0.4, 
95% CI 0.24–0.64; p=0.0002) [56]. A retrospective cohort 
study of 7217 kidney transplant recipients demonstrated 
a 46% signifcantly reduced risk of de novo malignancies 
in recipients treated with mTOR inhibitors compared with 
those never treated (p<0.05) [57].
Further evidence supports the use of mTOR inhibitors 
in patients with de novo malignancies after liver transplantation [58–60]. In 6 liver transplantation patients who 
converted from CNI to everolimus due to de novo malignancies, which appeared 3–4 years post-transplantation, 
83% (n=5) of patients remained disease-free after a mean 
follow-up time of 10±9 months; lung carcinoma recurred 
at 12-months following conversion in 1 patient [58]. From a 
total of 4 liver transplantation recipients who were converted 
to sirolimus-based immunosuppression due to the development of aggressive de novo malignancies, 3 patients who 
converted within 90–120 days after surgical removal of the 
malignancy remained tumor-free at 12–33 months post-conversion; 1 patient, who switched to sirolimus at 18 months 
after a mastectomy for breast cancer, died due to its recurrence [59].
In this setting, mTOR inhibitors may be used either as 
monotherapy or combined with reduced-exposure CNI, 
depending on individual risk factors (i.e., time post-transplantation, transplantation indication, age at transplantation, 
etc.) [15, 47, 48, 58–60].
Summary of recommendations and expert opinion
CNI reduction or discontinuation is recommended (Fig. 5). 
Given its antiproliferative properties, everolimus should be 
administered as soon as possible. mTOR inhibitor-based 
immunosuppression is warranted in all liver transplant 
recipients at high risk of de novo malignancies (i.e., human 
herpes virus-8-positive patients; patients with alcoholic cirrhosis; patients with concurrent infammatory bowel disease; 
recipients of grafts from donors at risk of transmission of 
malignancies; Epstein Barr virus-DNA positivity after transplantation) [15].
Acute rejection of the liver graft
Based on the available evidence and experience of the scientifc board members, the current guidelines were focused 
more on the mitigation of immunosuppression-related 
adverse events than on the treatment of acute rejection of the 
liver graft. For the management of acute rejection episodes, 
the scientifc board invites the use of the International Liver 

Hepatology International (2020) 14:930–943 939

Transplantation Society consensus guidelines on immunosuppression in liver transplant recipients [61].
Discussion
Although liver transplantation is well consolidated in Italy 
and elsewhere, a large amount of heterogeneity is apparent in the immunosuppression protocols used by diferent 
transplant centers. This is partly due to the observation 
that acute rejection of the liver graft does not afect graft 
or patient survival in adult liver transplantation, whilst 
focus is currently on the mitigation of immunosuppression-related adverse events [15]. As well as providing 
guidance to transplant physicians in the implementation 
of current recommendations for immunosuppressive therapy, the project undertaken in 2017 by the Italian Working 
Group aimed at standardizing immunosuppression regimens used in clinical practice with adult, ABO-compatible 
recipients. By dividing the population of liver transplant 
recipients into fve distinct categories and by designing 
specifc protocols for each category, the evidence- and 
consensus-based algorithms developed within the Italian 
Working Group, and presented here, may contribute to

simplify, personalize, and optimize immunosuppression 
in clinical practice.
It is important to monitor renal function with adequate 
tools (i.e., eGFR) across all categories of liver transplant 
recipients. However, there remain a number of issues that 
are still controversial/unresolved including the management 
of proteinuria, and the need for additional evidence for the 
management of critically ill patients. The role and relevance 
of mTOR inhibitors in the prevention of HCC recurrence 
are; not defnitively ascertained and need more scientifc indepth work. Evidence supporting the use of mTOR inhibitors in patients with HCC recurrence is also very limited.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the choice of the immunosuppressive regimen 
in liver transplantation should take into account a composite 
of clinical variables, including primary disease, patient status at transplantation, type of surgery, early post-operative 
events, and the expected complications associated with longterm use of CNI, namely acute and chronic renal failure and 
de novo malignancies. Strategies for the prevention or limitation of CNI-related adverse events should be implemented 
as early as possible following transplantation, according to 
patient clinical status. At present, the most efective nephroprotective strategies include the reduction of CNI exposure facilitated by the early introduction of everolimus, or 
mycophenolate mofetil if everolimus is not indicated.
