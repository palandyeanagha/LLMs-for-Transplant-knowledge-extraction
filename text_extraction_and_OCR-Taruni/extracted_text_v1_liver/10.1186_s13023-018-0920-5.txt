Abstract
Background: Oral cholic acid (CA) replacement has been shown to be an effective therapy in children with primary
bile acid synthesis defects, which are rare and severe genetic liver diseases. To date there has been no report of the
effects of this therapy in children reaching adulthood. The aim of the study was to evaluate the long-term effectiveness
and safety of CA therapy.
Methods: Fifteen patients with either 3β-hydroxy-Δ5
-C27-steroid oxidoreductase (3β-HSD) (n = 13) or Δ4–3-oxosteroid
5β-reductase (Δ4
–3-oxo-R) (n = 2) deficiency confirmed by mass spectrometry and gene sequencing received oral CA
and were followed prospectively.
Results: The median age at last follow-up and the median time of follow-up with treatment were 24.3 years (range: 15.
3–37.2) and 21.4 years (range: 14.6–24.1), respectively. At last evaluation, physical examination findings and blood
laboratory test results were normal in all patients. Liver sonograms were normal in most patients. Mean daily CA
dose was 6.9 mg/kg of body weight. Mass spectrometry analysis of urine showed that excretion of the atypical
metabolites remained low or traces in amount with CA therapy. Liver fibrosis scored in liver biopsies or assessed
by elastography in 14 patients, after 10 to 24 years with CA therapy, showed a marked improvement with disappearance
of cirrhosis (median score < F1; range: F0-F2). CA was well tolerated in all patients, including five women having 10
uneventful pregnancies during treatment.
Conclusions: Oral CA therapy is a safe and effective long-term treatment of 3β-HSD and Δ4
–3-oxo-R deficiencies and
allows affected children to reach adulthood in good health condition without the need for a liver transplantation.

Background
Inborn errors of primary bile acid synthesis are rare
inherited autosomal recessive disorders. The most
frequent defects are the 3β-Δ5
-hydroxy-C27-steroid oxidoreductase (3β-HSD) deficiency (OMIM 607765) which
is due to mutations in HSD3B7; and to a lesser extent
the Δ4
–3-oxosteroid-5β-reductase (Δ4–3-oxo-R) deficiency (OMIM 235555) due to mutations in AKR1D1
[1–7]. These defects in enzymes catalyzing key reactions
in the formation of the primary bile acids (BA), namely
cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) in
human, lead to an inadequate synthesis of primary BA
that are critical for bile formation and to the production
and the accumulation of atypical and hepatotoxic BA intermediates [8–11]. These deficiencies are most commonly manifest in neonates or infants as cholestasis and
can progress to early cirrhosis and liver failure unless
treated [1, 2, 7, 9, 10]. Absence of pruritus, normal

serum γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT) activity, and normal
or low total serum bile acid concentration are diagnostic
features of these conditions [12]. Specific diagnosis is
based on mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of urinary
bile acids showing typical bile acid profiles and on the
identification of disease-causing mutations in HSD3B7
or in AKR1D1 [1–10]. Oral primary bile acid replacement by CA or CDCA is required for these defects in
order to restore bile flow and to down-regulate endogenous bile acid synthesis [9, 10, 13–16]. CA is the major
primary bile acid in humans and is now recognized as
the bile acid of choice since it is neither hepatotoxic nor
embryotoxic/teratogenic, and is effective therapy for
3β-HSD and Δ4
–3-oxo-R deficiencies [9, 10, 14, 16–19].
CA is the only primary BA having a marketing
authorization in the USA [20] and in Europe [21] in these
two indications. Prolonged oral CA therapy is considered
safe and lifesaving during childhood as it leads to
normalization of clinical features, serum liver biochemistry and liver imaging, together with a substantial improvement of mass spectrometry bile acid profiles and liver
histology [14, 16–19]. However, published data concerning
the long-term outcome of such patients treated with oral
CA and reaching adulthood are lacking. In this study, we
updated the follow-up, after around 20 years of CA therapy, of a previously reported cohort of 15 patients with
3β-HSD or Δ4
–3-oxo-R deficiencies [14], most of whom
having now reached adulthood. The data confirm the favorable outcome with treatment, mainly the decrease in
liver fibrosis, and show that CA therapy should guarantee
a normal quality of life during adulthood.
Methods
Patients and study design
the 15 patients (13 with 3β-HSD deficiency [patients 1–
13, families A-I] and two with Δ4–3-oxo-R deficiency
[patients 14, 15, family J]), prospectively followed from
1993 to August 2007 and reported in 2009 [14] were
again followed prospectively during CA therapy from
August 2007 to 2017 (Table 1). This new 10-year period
of time of follow-up analysis represents the basis of the
study. As previously described, the follow-up evaluations
were performed every year and included: 1) physical
examination at least once a year; 2) blood liver biochemistry tests including alpha-fetoprotein and total serum
bile acids; 3) abdominal ultrasonography; 4) urine bile
acid analyses by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry
(GC-MS). Bile acid analyses in urine samples were

performed as previously described [14] and predominant
specific atypical bile acids were determined in urine and
expressed as a percentage of total urinary bile acids
(physiological plus atypical, in μmol/mmol creatinine).
In the 3β-HSD deficiency, 3β-hydroxylated-Δ5 derivatives were assayed whereas in Δ4
–3-oxo-R deficiency,
3-oxo-Δ4 derivatives were assayed. In addition, liver biopsy and/or liver elastography (Transient eslastography
(Fibroscan) (TE), supersonic shear imaging (SSI), or
acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) technologies)
were performed when indicated and according to patient
availability. Liver biopsy specimens were analyzed by the
same pathologist (C. G.) and compared to previous biopsies. Portal fibrosis and activity were scored according to
the grading system of Metavir, and severity and
localization of cholestasis were assessed as previously
described for these patients [14]. Data of the liver elastography measurements with TE, SSI, or ARFI technologies were used to estimate liver fibrosis. Because none of
these methods have been validated in hereditary defects
of primary bile acid synthesis, we chose cut-off values
for fibrosis staging (F0-F4) previously reported in
chronic liver diseases: 1) The cut off values of TE [22]
were: F1 ≥ 6.5, F2 ≥ 8.1, F3 ≥ 10.8, F4 ≥ 13.4; 2) The cut
off values of SSI [23] were: F1 ≥ 7.5, F2 ≥ 8.04, F3 ≥ 9.27,
F4 ≥ 11.12. For ARFI, a value < 1.207 m/s was considered
normal (F0) [24]. Quality of life, social status and professional activity of the patients were assessed by history
taking at each clinic visit in our centre.
Treatment
From 1993 to August 2007, patients received cholic acid
as previously reported [14]. Since August 2007, patients
received cholic acid (Orphacol, Laboratoires CTRS,
Boulogne-Billancourt, France) in two divided doses with
50 mg and/or 250 mg capsules [21]. At this date, the
mean daily dose of CA was 6.3 mg/kg and 5.3 mg/kg in
3β-HSD deficiency and Δ4
–3-oxo-R deficiency patients,
respectively [14]. One patient with Δ4
–3oxo-R deficiency
(patient 14) was still receiving daily 4 mg/kg of UDCA
(200 mg/d) given separately from CA. This small
amount of UDCA was necessary in this patient to maintain normal serum liver biochemistry tests, which were
otherwise slightly abnormal. Doses of CA were thereafter adapted individually based upon the results of the
follow-up urinary bile acid analyses by GC-MS and
serum liver tests. The dosage of 500 mg/day, corresponding to the physiologic daily synthesis rate for
primary bile acids in healthy adults [8], was considered as a maximum.
Results
The median age at last follow-up and the median time
of follow-up with treatment were 24.3 years (range:
15.3–37.2) and 21.4 years (range: 14.6–24.1), respectively
(Table 1). At last evaluation, physical examination findings and blood laboratory test (liver tests, alphafetoprotein, prothrombin time, factor V, albumin, bile acids,
and fat-soluble vitamins) were normal in all patients.
Growth in weight and height were within the normal
range in all patients. Areflexia or decreased tendon reflexes observed after 5 years with CA therapy in patients
2, 3, 6 and 7 was still observed in these four patients at
last follow-up. Liver sonograms were normal in most patients. However, hyperechogenic liver and dystrophic
liver were observed in 2 patients (patients 6, 11) and 1
patient (patient 14), respectively. None of the 15 patients
had ultrasonographic evidence for liver dysplasia. Gallstones were observed in 1 patient (patient 3). Of note, 2
patients (patients 1 and 4) underwent previously a cholecystectomy for a gallstone disease which did not recur
after surgery. Renal cysts initially present in five children
with 3β-HSD deficiency and no longer detectable after
few years of CA therapy remained undetectable at last
follow-up. Mean daily CA dose was 6.9 mg/kg of body
weight. Patient 14 still receives UDCA (200 mg/d; 3 mg/
kg/d). Mass spectrometry analysis of urinary bile acids
showed that excretion of the atypical metabolites
remained low or traces in amount with CA therapy. In
the 13 patients with 3β-HSD deficiency, at initial evaluation and before CA therapy, 3β-hydroxylated-Δ5 derivatives represented an average of 94% of total urinary bile
acids. These atypical bile acids were dramatically reduced at last evaluation in our previous report after a
median follow-up of around 10 years with CA therapy
[14]. In the present report and at last evaluation after a
median follow-up of 21.9 years with CA therapy, these
atypical metabolites were still dramatically reduced by
300 fold (mean: 0.064 μmol/mmol creatinine) and were
undetectable in six patients (patients 1, 2, 7, 11, 12. 13).
However, in case of imperfect compliance (patients 6
and 8), we observed an increase in the amount of these
atypical BA, which decreased again to their usual levels
after improvement of compliance (patient 6). In the two
patients with Δ4
–3-oxo-R deficiency, at initial evaluation
and before CA therapy, 3-oxo-Δ4 derivatives represented
an average of 89% of total urinary bile acids. These atypical bile acids were highly reduced by 30 fold at last
evaluation in our previous report after a follow-up of
around 10 years with CA therapy [14]. In the present report and at last evaluation after a follow-up of 20 years
with CA therapy, these atypical bile acids remained at
similar levels with a reduction of 37 fold (1.81 μmol/
mmol creatinine). No problem of compliance was observed in these 2 patients.

normal at age 27.9 and after 23.6 years with CA (patient
2, family B). No signs of cholestasis and of inflammatory
activity were seen in the biopsy of patient 10 (family G)
with 3β-HSD deficiency performed after 11.5 years of
treatment (Fig. 2) and in the two biopsies performed
after 16 years of treatment in patients 14 and 15 (Family
J) with Δ4
–3-oxo-R deficiency (Fig. 3). No patients developed portal hypertension. CA was well tolerated in all
patients. Sexual maturation progressed normally in all
patients (female and male), including in the two girls
who did not yet reach adult age (patients 5 and 13).
While treated with CA, four women with 3β-HSD deficiency (patients 2, 7, 9, 10) and one woman with Δ4
–
3-oxo-R deficiency (patient 14) have had nine uneventful
pregnancies and one uneventful pregnancy, respectively.
During all pregnancies doses of CA were not modified
and all newborns were healthy.
At the time of data collection, 5 patients were still
students (2 at school (college), 3 at university), 8 were
employed (1 is a nurse, 1 is a teacher, 1 is an assistant
in a pet store, 1 is a garbage collector, 1 is a sports educator, 1 is a qualified worker, 2 are engineers) and 2
were housewives. All the patients reported a normal
quality of life.
Discussion
Oral bile acid therapy has been reported to be effective
in the treatment of the most common primary bile acid
synthesis defects and CA therapy is the recommended
therapy in these rare diseases, which are commonly lethal or require liver transplantation if untreated. The
aim of this study was to make an update of the
follow-up after around 20 years of CA therapy of our
previously reported cohort of 15 patients with 3β-HSD
or Δ4
–3-oxo-R deficiencies [14], most of them having
now reached adulthood, and to evaluate the long-term
effectiveness and safety of CA therapy. The data confirm
the favorable outcome with treatment, mainly the

children with 3β-hydroxy-Δ5-C27-steroid oxidoreductase deficiency

scores were assessed according to Metavir in liver biopsy specimens
or as described in the patients and methods section in cases of
assessment using non-invasive methods. See Table 2 for the details
of fibrosis scores. Data are presented as mean +/− SD values. When
in a patient 2 values of fibrosis score were recorded during the
same time period, only the most recent score was considered to
calculate the mean +/− SD values

decrease in liver fibrosis, and show that CA therapy
is safe and should guarantee a normal quality of life
during adulthood.
The 15 children with a genetic defect in primary bile
acid synthesis received oral CA treatment for a median
period of 21.4 years. With CA therapy, the long-term
outcome and the biochemical control of the patients
were excellent. All patients are alive with their native
liver, with normal findings on physical examination, unless hypo/areflexia in 4 patients being the irreversible
consequence of prolonged vitamin E deficiency before
disease diagnosis. Also, all patients had normal serum
liver biochemistry tests and the excretion of the atypical
metabolites of bile acids remained low or traces in
amount, signing a good metabolic control of the primary
bile acid synthesis defects with CA therapy. However,
for patients with 3β-HSD deficiency, one study suggested that tandem mass spectrometry could allow a
more accurate quantification of 3β-hydroxylated-Δ5 derivatives [25]. Most patients had normal liver ultrasonography and 4 patients had minor ultrasonographic liver
abnormalities. In all patients serum alphafetoprotein level
was persistently normal and none of the patients developed hepatocellular carcinoma. Liver fibrosis scored in
liver biopsies and/or by elastography in 14 patients, after
10 to 24 years of CA therapy, seems to confirm in the
long-term the previously reported marked improvement
of fibrosis with time compared to initial scores. Of note
we observed a disappearance of cirrhosis in 3 patients, as
it has been reported in other liver diseases [26]. Among
the non-invasive methods of measuring liver stiffness that
is supposed to mainly result from fibrosis, TE, SSI and
ARFI technologies have shown good accuracy for the detection and quantification of liver fibrosis in adult series
[22–24, 27]. These series concerned patients with different
types of liver diseases, including patients with chronic

cholestasis but no patients with cholestasis due to a primary defect in bile acid synthesis were reported in these
series. Therefore, the absence of previous validation of
these technologies to evaluate liver fibrosis in the patients
reported here may represent a limitation in the interpretation of the data. Only two patients had a worsening of fibrosis score after 20 years of therapy (patients 6 (E1) and
8 (F)). In patient 6, this was transient and likely due to
chronic alcohol intake and poor compliance to therapy
since the age of 18 years; fibrosis score improved after
good compliance and alcoholic withdrawal were achieved.
In patient 8, worsening of fibrosis score can be explained
by a chronic imperfect compliance.
The study confirmed the safety of CA therapy, including during pregnancy. No serious adverse events were
observed with a cumulative duration of treatment of
more than 300 patient-years and five women treated at
therapeutic/physiologic doses have given birth to 10
healthy newborns. This shows that CA is unlikely to be
embryotoxic when taken at therapeutic (physiologic)
doses during pregnancy. Last but not least, all the patients had a social status and a professional activity similar to the general population.
Conclusions
All in all, these data show that oral CA therapy is a safe
and effective long-term treatment of the most common
primary bile acid synthesis defects. CA therapy allows affected children to reach adulthood in good health
condition without the need for a liver transplantation.
Provided a successful transition and a follow-up during
adulthood performed by a specialized hepatologist, it is
likely that CA therapy will guarantee to patients, including patients diagnosed at adult age, a normal quality of
life throughout all their lifetime [28–30].

August 2007 to September 2013, patients benefited from a “Autorisation
Temporaire d’Utilisation” delivered for each patient by the “Agence Nationale
de Sécurité du Médicament et des Produits de Santé (France)”. Thereafter,
the European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid
throughout the European Union for Orphacol on September 2013 [21].
Therefore, for the 10 year period from August 2007 to 2017 which represents
the basis of the study, consent to participate was not needed.
