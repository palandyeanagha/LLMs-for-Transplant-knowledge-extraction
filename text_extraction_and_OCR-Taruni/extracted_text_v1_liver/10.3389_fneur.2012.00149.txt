Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is recurrent obstruction of the upper airway during sleep
leading to intermittent hypoxia (IH). OSA has been associated with all components of the
metabolic syndrome as well as with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is a
common condition ranging in severity from uncomplicated hepatic steatosis to steatohepatitis (NASH), liver fibrosis, and cirrhosis.The gold standard for the diagnosis and staging of
NAFLD is liver biopsy. Obesity and insulin resistance lead to liver steatosis, but the causes
of the progression to NASH are not known. Emerging evidence suggests that OSA may
play a role in the progression of hepatic steatosis and the development of NASH. Several
cross-sectional studies showed that the severity of IH in patients with OSA predicted the
severity of NAFLD on liver biopsy. However, neither prospective nor interventional studies
with continuous positive airway pressure treatment have been performed. Studies in a
mouse model showed that IH causes triglyceride accumulation in the liver and liver injury
as well as hepatic inflammation. The mouse model provided insight in the pathogenesis of
liver injury showing that (1) IH accelerates the progression of hepatic steatosis by inducing
adipose tissue lipolysis and increasing free fatty acids (FFA) flux into the liver; (2) IH upregulates lipid biosynthetic pathways in the liver; (3) IH induces oxidative stress in the liver;
(4) IH up-regulates hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha and possibly HIF-2 alpha, which may
increase hepatic steatosis and induce liver inflammation and fibrosis. However, the role of
FFA and different transcription factors in the pathogenesis of IH-induced NAFLD is yet to
be established. Thus, multiple lines of evidence suggest that IH of OSA may contribute
to the progression of NAFLD but definitive clinical studies and experiments in the mouse
model have yet to be done.

INTRODUCTION
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder that affects
4–24% of men and 2–9% of women in the United States (Young
et al., 1993), but the prevalence of OSA exceeds 30–50% in obese
individuals Punjabi et al. (2002), Vgontzas et al. (2000), Young
et al. (1993), Tufik et al. (2010), Young et al. (2002). OSA is characterized by recurrent upper airway collapse during sleep resulting
in fragmentation of sleep and recurrent oxyhemoglobin desaturations termed chronic intermittent hypoxia (IH; Gastaut et al.,
1966). OSA markedly increases mortality and morbidity due to
the increased cardiovascular risk (Gami et al., 2005; Yaggi et al.,
2005; Marshall et al., 2008; Young et al., 2008; Punjabi et al., 2009).
The cardiovascular risk of OSA has been attributed to metabolic
dysfunction (Jun and Polotsky, 2009; Lavie and Polotsky, 2009;
Drager et al., 2010a). OSA is associated with all manifestations
of the metabolic syndrome, including visceral obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance (Levy et al., 2009; Drager
et al., 2010b; Sharma et al., 2011; Bonsignore et al., 2012). Recent
clinical data suggests that metabolic dysfunction of OSA is associated with nocturnal IH, independent of obesity (Drager et al.,
2010b; Bonsignore et al., 2012). Experiments in a mouse model of
IH mimicking oxyhemoglobin desaturations in patients with OSA
showed that IH induces insulin resistance, glucose intolerance,
and dyslipidemia in the absence of obesity (Li et al., 2005b, 2006,
2007; Iiyori et al., 2007; Savransky et al., 2007b), but the effects
of IH are particularly severe in the presence of obesity (Polotsky et al., 2003; Drager et al., 2011). Recent studies in healthy
human volunteers have also shown that IH induces insulin resistance, independent of obesity (Louis and Punjabi, 2009). Insulin
resistance and dyslipidemia induced by OSA can be reversed by
continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP; Robinson et al., 2004;
Sharma et al., 2011). OSA is associated with another manifestation of metabolic dysfunction, non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD;
Tanne et al., 2005; Jouet et al., 2007; Kallwitz et al., 2007; Polotsky et al., 2009). Animal and human data indicate that IH of OSA
may contribute to the progression of NAFLD, a common condition with the prevalence between 17 and 33% and the major risk
factors being obesity and insulin resistance (Hilden et al., 1977;
Nomura et al., 1988; Bellentani et al., 2000; Browning and Horton, 2004; Browning et al., 2004; Clark, 2006; McCullough, 2006).

relationships between OSA and liver disease and examine putative

mechanisms linking sleep disordered breathing and nocturnal IH
with NAFLD. We will begin with a brief overview of NAFLD.
NAFLD: CLINICAL OVERVIEW
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease includes a spectrum of the disease
severity, ranging from steatosis without inflammation to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and liver cirrhosis (Day and
James, 1998; Browning and Horton, 2004; Diehl, 2005). NASH is
a progressive fibrotic disease, in which cirrhosis and liver-related
death occur in up to 20 and 12% patients, respectively (McCullough, 2004). Approximately 10–30% patients with hepatic steatosis have histologicalfeatures of NASH (McCullough,2006;Tilg and
Moschen, 2010). NASH is the most common cause of cryptogenic
liver cirrhosis in the U.S. (Caldwell et al., 1999; Clark and Diehl,
2003). NASH has also been implicated in causality of at least 7%
of cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (Bugianesi et al., 2002). Multiple treatment options were considered for NASH, but, with a
possible exception of a moderate benefit from vitamin E, effective
therapy is still lacking (Kashi et al., 2008; Torres and Harrison,
2008; Vuppalanchi and Chalasani, 2009; Sanyal et al., 2010).
To this date, liver biopsy remains the gold standard to diagnose and stage NAFLD (Clark and Diehl, 2003; Vuppalanchi and
Chalasani, 2009). The Pathology Committee of the NASH Clinical Research Network developed a histological scoring system that
determines the severity of NAFLD based on a NAFLD activity
score (NAS; Kleiner et al., 2005), which is now being uniformly
used. This scoring system assesses a degree of steatosis, lobular
inflammation, hepatocellular ballooning, and fibrosis. NAS is a
sum of steatosis, lobular inflammation, and hepatocellular ballooning scores. Fibrosis was not included as a component of NAS,
because it is less reversible and does not reflect the acuteness of
the inflammatory process. NAS ≥ 5 is considered NASH, whereas
NAS < 3 excludes NASH (Kleiner et al., 2005).
Liver biopsy is an invasive procedure, therefore non-invasive
biomarkers of NAFLD is a desirable alternative. Serum alanine and
aspartate aminotransferases (ALT and AST) indicate liver injury,
but are neither sensitive nor specific to diagnose NAFLD and characterize its severity (Clark and Diehl, 2003; Browning et al., 2004).
Serum alkaline phosphatase (AP) and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) may indicate intrahepatic cholestasis, but cannot be
used to assess liver injury. Serum ferritin has been suggested as a
biomarker of NAFLD (Licata et al., 2009; Manousou et al., 2011;
Kim et al., 2012; Kowdley et al., 2012). Serrum ferritin is independently associated with advanced hepatic fibrosis (odds ratio,
OR, 1.66) and increased NAS (OR, 1.99; Kowdley et al., 2012). The
NASH Clinical Research Network currently recommends serum
ferritin to identify NAFLD patients at risk for NASH and advanced
fibrosis However, the sensitivity and specificity of ferritin for the
diagnosis of NASH are relatively low (Kowdley et al., 2012).
Over the last decade several biochemical panels were developed
and tested as surrogate markers of NAFLD. FibroTest includes α2-
macroglobulin, apolipoprotein A1, haptoglobin, total bilirubin,
and GGT adjusted for age and gender. ActiTest includes same five
components and ALT. SteatoTest and NashTest include the same
components as ActiTest plus serum glucose, triglycerides, and cholesterol adjusted for age, gender, and BMI (Poynard et al., 2012).
The value of these biochemical panels has been systematically
reviewed in a recent meta-analysis in severely obese individuals
(Poynard et al., 2012). FibroTest has very low sensitivity and negative predictive value for the diagnosis of liver fibrosis (13.4 and
51.5%, respectively), but high specificity and positive predictive
value (97.5 and 85%, respectively). Depending on the value cut-off,
SteatoTest and NashTest had either low sensitivity and relatively
high specificity or vice versa for respective diagnoses of hepatic
steatosis and NASH (Poynard et al., 2012). Other biomarker panels such as FibroSpect II (hyaluronic acid, tissue inhibitor of matrix
metalloproteinase I,α2-macroglobulin),N-terminal propeptide of
type III collagen, and others have not been validated in NAFLD
(Baranova et al., 2011). Overall, biochemical serum testing may
identify patients at risk of NAFLD and NASH but does not allow
reliably stage the disease.
Recent progress in imaging technology, ultrasound, computer
tomography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and magnetic
resonance spectroscopy (MRS) allow reliably diagnose and quantify hepatic steatosis (Springer et al., 2010; Hernaez et al., 2011;
Patel et al., 2011). A novel ultrasound technology FibroScan has
recently been developed (Friedrich-Rust et al., 2010; Myers et al.,
2012a,b). The FibroScan (Echosens, Paris, France) allows simultaneous assessment of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis. The Controlled
Attenuation Parameter (CAP) measures the degree of ultrasound
attenuation by hepatic fat simultaneously with liver stiffness measurements. CAP values significantly correlated with the degree of
steatosis on liver biopsy (r = 0.47–0.51; Myers et al., 2012a). Compared to liver histology, the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound
transient elastography in significant liver fibrosis is 0.80 for the
M probe and 0.82 for the XL probe and in liver cirrhosis is 0.91
for the M probe and 0.95 for the XL probe (Friedrich-Rust et al.,
2010). The diagnostic performance of the XL probe was found
to be superior to the M probe for liver stiffness measurements in
obese patients (Friedrich-Rust et al., 2010). Magnetic resonancebased elastography is another promising technique to detect liver
fibrosis (Bonekamp et al., 2009). Thus, non-invasive novel imaging techniques can detect hepatic steatosis and liver fibrosis with
a reasonable accuracy, but do not allow the assessment of hepatic
inflammation.
NAFLD: PATHOGENESIS
Day and James (1998) proposed a “two-hit” model to explain the
progression of NAFLD. The “first hit” involves the accumulation
of triglyceride in hepatocytes, and has been specifically attributed to insulin resistance and obesity. Obesity and insulin resistance are characterized by increased adipocyte mass and increased
hormone-sensitive lipase activity, which leads to up-regulation of
lipolysis and increased uptake of free fatty acids (FFA) by the
liver (Browning and Horton, 2004). In turn, increased FFA uptake
induces triglyceride biosynthesis and hepatic steatosis. In addition,
high levels of insulin in obese individuals may up-regulate hepatic
lipid biosynthesis de novo by activating a master-regulator of
lipid biosynthesis, a transcription factor sterol regulatory element
binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c; Foretz et al., 1999; Shimomura
et al., 1999b) and a SREBP-1-regulated enzymes of triglyceride
biosynthesis stearoyl coenzyme A desaturase 1 (SCD-1; Cohen
et al., 2002; Biddinger et al., 2005) and diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGAT). Persistent hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes

Mirrakhimov and Polotsky Obstructive sleep apnea and fatty liver
may activate another lipogenic transcription factor, carbohydrate
response element binding protein (ChREBP; Iizuka et al., 2004;
Dentin et al., 2006; Ma et al., 2006; Postic et al., 2007; Davies et al.,
2008). Over-expression of SREBP-1c has been shown to lead to
fatty liver in mouse models of insulin resistance and obesity (Shimomura et al., 1998, 1999a), and can account for the development
of hepatic steatosis in human subjects. In turn, hepatic fat accumulation increases insulin resistance stimulating gluconeogenesis
and activating protein kinase C-ε and janus kinase 1, which interfere with tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrates 1
and 2 and impair the ability of insulin to activate glycogen synthase
(Samuel et al., 2004; Savage et al., 2007).
When hepatic steatosis progresses to NASH, hepatic lobules
become infiltrated with a mixed population of inflammatory cells.
Inflammation is followed or accompanied by hepatocyte ballooning and necrosis, appearance of Mallory bodies, and, finally,
perisinusoidal fibrosis, or cirrhosis (Ludwig et al., 1997; CarmielHaggai et al., 2005). The progression of hepatic steatosis to NASH
has been attributed to a “second hit” that leads to the development
of liver inflammation and fibrosis (Day and James, 1998). Obesity,
age over 45 years, diabetes, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypertension
have been identified as risk factors for the progression of NAFLD
(Angulo et al., 1999; Dixon et al., 2001; Bugianesi et al., 2002). The
progression of NAFLD to NASH was linked to oxidative stress and
lipid peroxidation in the liver, leading to inflammation (Robertson
et al., 2001; George et al., 2003; Bergamini et al., 2004; Browning
and Horton, 2004; Laurent et al., 2004;Carmiel-Haggai et al., 2005;
Oliveira et al., 2005; Seki et al., 2005; McCullough, 2006).
“A two-hit” model of NAFLD progression has been recently
revised. Simple steatosis, which never progresses in 70–90% of
NAFLD patients, might be a separate entity from relentlessly
progressing NASH. Inhibition of DGAT-1 or SCD-1 improves
liver steatosis but worsens liver damage suggesting that accumulation of triglycerides in the liver may protect against NASH
(Yamaguchi et al., 2007, 2008; Li et al., 2009; Tilg and Moschen,
2010). NASH could be a result of multiple hits to the liver with
major contribution of pathologically enhanced lipolysis of visceral
and subcutaneous adipose tissue and ensuing hepatic lipotoxicity
(Neuschwander-Tetri,2010). Other hits include pro-inflammatory
cytokines and adipokines derived from adipose tissues such as leptin, IL-6, TNF-α as well as gut-derived factors and endoplasmic
reticulum stress (Tilg and Moschen, 2010). Recent clinical evidence suggests that OSA may lead to NAFLD progression, whereas
experimental literature showed that IH induces liver injury and
steatohepatitis.
NAFLD AND OSA: CLINICAL EVIDENCE
Several cross-sectional studies examined levels of liver enzymes
in serum of patients with OSA (Table 1). Chin et al. (2003) were
first to report abnormally elevated morning AST levels in 14 out
of 40 studied OSA patients (35%). Increased liver enzymes correlated with insulin resistance measured by the homeostasis model
assessment method (HOMA). Norman et al.(2008) demonstrated
in 109 patients with OSA that ALT and AST levels directly correlated with the severity of nocturnal hypoxia, but not with the
apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) or BMI. Increased ALT, AST, and
AP in adult patients with moderate and severe OSA have also
been reported by Shpirer et al. (2010). Gude et al. (2009) studied
a randomly selected a population sample of 220 individuals and
found that serum GGT levels directly correlated with a degree of
nocturnal hypoxemia (Tables 1 and 2). Unfortunately, all of the
above studies lacked a control group.
Several cross-sectional studies compared OSA patients to control subjects.Kheirandish-Gozal et al.(2008)reported significantly
higher serum ALT levels in children with OSA compared to children without OSA. In bariatric population, Kallwitz et al. (2007)
and Jouet et al.(2007)reported a higher prevalence of elevated ALT
levels in patients with OSA compared to those without OSA. In the
sleep clinic population, the presence of severe OSA (AHI > 50) was
an independent predictor of elevated liver enzymes (Tanne et al.,
2005). Notably, several studies in the bariatric and sleep clinic
populations found no relationship between liver enzymes and the
presence or severity of OSA (Polotsky et al.,2009;Aron-Wisnewsky
et al., 2012). Liver enzymes remained within normal limits, despite
significant changes on histopathology. One study reported a direct
correlation between a serum marker of liver fibrosis, type III procollagen, and triglyceride and fasting plasma glucose, but not
ALT or AST (Tatsumi and Saibara, 2005). The effect of CPAP
on ALT and AST level was assessed a non-randomized uncontrolled clinical trial by Chin et al. (2003), who reported that one
night of CPAP significantly decreased morning AST levels and
abolished morning increases in AST and ALT. However, the only
randomized placebo controlled study failed to find any effect of
therapeutic CPAP treatment for 4 weeks on liver enzymes compared to sham CPAP (Kohler et al., 2009). Overall, evidence that
OSA has an independent effect on liver enzyme levels remains
inconclusive and may pertain only to severe OSA with marked
nocturnal oxyhemoglobin desaturations. Given that elevated liver
enzymes are neither sensitive nor specific markers of NAFLD
and NASH (Clark and Diehl, 2003; Browning et al., 2004), studies focusing on liver enzymes could not elucidate relationships
between OSA and NAFLD. Other serum biomarkers of NAFLD
(NAFLD: Clinical Overview) have not been studied in patients
with OSA.
OSA AND LIVER IMAGING STUDIES
To our knowledge, there have been only four liver imaging studies
in patients with OSA, three of which utilized computer tomography (CT) to assess the degree of hepatic steatosis (Tatsumi and
Saibara, 2005; Shpirer et al., 2010; Hoyos et al., 2012) and one
study used MRI/MRS. Tatsumi and Saibara (2005) measured the
amount of visceral and liver fat in patients with OSA (AHI > 5/h)
compared to non-OSA subjects and found that the presence of
OSA was associated with increased visceral adiposity, but not with
the degree of hepatic steatosis (Table 1). Shpirer et al. (2010) retrospectively analyzed liver CT in 47 patients with OSA and found
an association between hepatic steatosis and the severity of OSA.
However, patients with severe OSA and hepatic steatosis on CT
had a higher BMI and, therefore, the results of the study were
confounded by obesity. The effect of CPAP treatment for 3 years
was examined in 11 patients. CPAP therapy was associated with
a decrease in hepatic steatosis in six compliant patients, despite
unchanged BMI, but not in five non-compliant patients. Hoyos
et al. (2012) recruited patients with moderate-severe OSA and

sensitivity was assessed based on fasting blood glucose and insulin;
serum leptin and adiponectin were measured. There was no effect
of CPAP on liver steatosis or any metabolic parameters at 12 weeks.
Insulin sensitivity improved at 24 weeks, while liver fat and all
other biomarkers remained unchanged. Sivam et al. (2012) performed a randomized double-blinded sham controlled trial of
CPAP for 8 weeks and reported no effect of CPAP on liver fat
or liver enzyme with exception of a mild decline in AP. Imaging
studies have not been used to assess liver fibrosis in OSA. Thus,
literature on liver imaging in OSA is fragmentary and inconclusive.
OSA AND LIVER PATHOLOGY
The gold standard of NAFLD diagnosis, staging, and prognosis is
liver biopsy. The first case report of severe NASH with intralobular
and periportal inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning, and pericellular fibrosis in a patient with obesity hypoventilation syndrome
was published in 2002 (Saibara et al., 2002). Since that time a number of studies examining relationships between OSA and findings
in liver biopsy have been conducted (Table 2). All of these studies are cross-sectional, because it is not feasible to obtain liver
biopsy repeatedly due to ethical considerations. Studies, in which
polysomnography (PSG) has not been performed could not be
used for the reliable analysis of the OSA-NAFLD association and
will not be further discussed. In the first PSG based study, Tanne

with severe OSA defined as the AHI > 50/h (n = 9), exhibited more
severe liver steatosis, necrosis, and fibrosis than subjects with the
AHI ≤ 50/h (n = 9). Other studies focused on the bariatric population taking an advantage of the availability of intra-operative
liver biopsy. Kallwitz et al.(2007) performed a retrospective review
of 101 patients who underwent gastric bypass surgery. Liver biopsy
was performed only if the liver had abnormal appearance (enlargement, yellow discoloration, or nodularity). Both PSG and liver
biopsy were performed in 85 patients. There was a trend toward a
higher prevalence of OSA in patients with inflammation and fibrosis (11/15) compared with those with inflammation alone (22/48).
There was no association between OSA and the degree of steatosis, presence of hepatitis, balloon degeneration, or fibrosis on liver
biopsy. Similarly,Jouet et al.(2007) also reported the lack of association between OSA and histological markers of NASH. However,
relationships between nocturnal hypoxemia and NASH had not
been examined. Mishra et al. (2008) studied 101 bariatric patients
with biopsy-proven NAFLD, all of whom had full PSG in a sleep
laboratory. The lowest desaturation independently correlated with
histological NASH. Both mean and lowest oxygen desaturation
were independently associated with the presence of liver fibrosis,
whereas there was no statistically significant relationships between
the AHI and RDI (the respiratory disturbance index defined as
a number of apneas, hypopneas, and respiratory effort related
arousals per hour) and liver fibrosis. Polotsky et al. (2009) studied 90 consecutive bariatric patients, all of which underwent PSG,
and reported the prevalence of OSA (the RDI > 5/h) of 81.1%.
The analysis of liver biopsies (n = 20) showed that lobular inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning, the NAS, and liver fibrosis were
associated with severe oxyhemoglobin desaturation (Figure 1),
but not the RDI and this association was independent of BMI.
Aron-Wisnewsky et al. (2012) performed continuous nocturnal
pulse oximetry in 101 bariatric patients who underwent liver needle biopsy intra-operatively. Liver histology was compared in three
tertiles of oxygen desaturation index (ODI), <6.7, 6.8–18.5, and
>18.5 /h. The BMI was similar in all tertiles varying from 45.7 to

48.3 kg/m2, whereas patients with more severe OSA had higher
prevalence of type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension.
There was a significant increase in liver steatosis, ballooning, lobular inflammation, NAS, and liver fibrosis with increased ODI.
After the adjustment for type 2 diabetes, inflammation, age, and
sex, the ODI remained independently associated with higher NAS
and the severity of liver fibrosis. Notably, similarly to Polotsky et al.
(2009), ALT and AST values were within the normal range in all
patients, regardless of the severity of OSA and NASH. Thus, emerging evidence demonstrates that there is an association between the
severity of hypoxic indexes in patients with OSA and the severity
of NAFLD diagnosed by liver biopsy. The effect of CPAP treatment
on NAFLD pathology has not been examined.
OSA AND HYPOXIC LIVER INJURY
Although the prevalence of NAFLD in patients with OSA remains
unknown, clinical evidence suggests it might be a common phenomenon. In contrast, hypoxic liver injury with hyper-acute elevation of aminotransferases >1000, liver necrosis and coagulopathy
has been described only in a handful of cases (Mathurin et al.,
1995;Henrion et al., 1997, 2003;Trakada et al., 2004). Patients with
OSA-induced liver injury uniformly had obesity hypoventilation
syndrome with daytime hypoxemia, and sleep disordered breathing in these cases was characterized by severe hypoxemia with
oxyhemoglobin saturation below 70% for prolonged periods of
time. Nevertheless, current clinical evidence demonstrates that
liver pathology in OSA by enlarge is not a result of simple liver
tissue hypoxia.
IH AND NAFLD: EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE
A mouse model of IH mimicking oxyhemoglobin desaturations
in patients with OSA has been utilized with a FiO2 fluctuating between 20.9 and 5% 60 times/h during the 12 h light phase
(9am to 9pm) when 70% of mouse sleep occurs (Polotsky et al.,
2006). O2 swings resulted in reciprocal changes in oxyhemoglobin
saturation (SpO2) from 95–98% to mid 60%–low 70% (Reinke
et al., 2011a,b). Lean C57BL/6J mice exposed to such a regimen
did not immediately develop liver injury. In fact, lipid peroxidation increased in the liver only after 4 weeks of exposure, but
serum aminotransferases remained within the normal range (Jun
et al., 2008; Drager et al., 2011). Only after 12 weeks of exposure,
lean C57BL/6J mice exhibited a mild increase in serum ALT to
∼200 U/L and exhibited moderate hepatocellular swelling without
steatosis or cellular apoptosis (Savransky et al., 2007c). The presence of obesity dramatically exacerbated effects of IH. In C57BL/6J
mice with diet-induced obesity (DIO), IH for 4 weeks increased
the degree of hepatic steatosis, induced lipid peroxidation on the
liver, elevated ALT, AST, and AP levels and exacerbated insulin

Mirrakhimov and Polotsky Obstructive sleep apnea and fatty liver
resistance, a hallmark of NASH (Drager et al., 2011). In DIO mice,
but not in lean mice, IH increased RNA and protein levels of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and MIP-2 in the liver suggesting
the progression of hepatic steatosis to steatohepatitis (Drager et al.,
2011). IH for 6 months converted diet-induced hepatic steatosis to
NASH with liver fibrosis (Savransky et al., 2007a). Thus, experimental evidence suggests that IH per se is not sufficient to cause
NAFLD in the mouse model. IH and obesity interact to exacerbate
hepatic steatosis converting it to steatohepatitis.
MECHANISMS OF NAFLD AND NASH IN OSA
Putative mechanisms by which OSA may promote the development and progression of NAFD are depicted in Figure 2. OSA
encompasses several physiological mechanisms which may predispose to NAFLD including negative intra-thoracic pressure swings,
sleep fragmentation, hypercapnea, and IH. However, the relationship between NAFLD and IH is the only one which has been studied and will be further discussed. We will first review mechanisms
by which IH may lead to hepatic steatosis.

(NASH) during intermittent hypoxia of obstructive sleep apnea. FFA,

regulatory element binding protein.
IH AND HEPATIC STEATOSIS
Intermittent hypoxia may exacerbate hepatic steatosis via systemic
and tissue specific mechanisms. Systemic mechanisms are likely
mediated via the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Obesity and
insulin resistance are characterized by increased adipocyte mass
and increased hormone-sensitive lipase activity, which leads to
up-regulation of lipolysis and increased uptake of FFA by the liver
(Browning and Horton, 2004). SNS is a major regulator of lipolysis
(Jaworski et al.,2007;Bickel et al.,2009; Lafontan and Langin,2009;
Zechner et al., 2009). Human OSA and IH in rodents activate SNS
and increase circulating catecholamine levels (Somers et al., 1989,
1995; Carlson et al., 1993; Dimsdale et al., 1995; Fletcher et al.,
1995; Hedner et al., 1995; Bao et al., 1997; Narkiewicz et al., 1998,
1999). Activation of the SNS during IH occurs through the hypoxic
chemo-reflex in the carotid body and ablation of the carotid sinus
nerve prevents IH-induced hypertension (Fletcher et al., 1992a,b;
Fletcher, 2001; Prabhakar et al., 2007; Prabhakar and Kumar,
2010). We and others have recently shown that sleep apnea raises
circulating FFA levels in proportion to the severity of hypoxia
(Barcelo et al., 2011; Jun et al., 2011) suggesting that IH leads
to exuberant lipolysis in adipose tissue. The FFA influx into the
liver may induce insulin resistance and triglyceride biosynthesis
leading to hepatic steatosis (Delarue and Magnan, 2007; Guilherme et al., 2008; Jocken and Blaak, 2008; Neuschwander-Tetri,
2010; Tilg and Moschen, 2010). In addition, high levels of insulin
in obese individuals may up-regulate hepatic lipid biosynthesis
de novo by activating SREBP-1c (Foretz et al., 1999; Shimomura
et al., 1999b) and a SREBP-1-regulated enzyme of triglyceride
biosynthesis SCD-1 (Cohen et al., 2002; Biddinger et al., 2005).
Exposure to IH for 5 days to 12 weeks uniformly activated the
SREBP-1c axis and downstream SCD-1 in both lean and obese
mice inducing triglyceride accumulation in the liver, which was
more pronounced in DIO and in mice with leptin-deficient obesity
(Li et al., 2005a,b, 2007; Savransky et al., 2007b;Drager et al., 2011).
It is conceivable that IH induces hepatic steatosis by up-regulating
hypoxia inducible factors 1 and 2, masters-regulators of metabolic
responses to hypoxia composed of constitutively expressed HIF1β and O2 responsive 1α and 2α subunits respectively (Semenza,
2007; Semenza and Prabhakar, 2007; Majmundar et al., 2010).
Obesity is associated with liver tissue hypoxia, which may be further exacerbated by IH of OSA (Reinke et al., 2011a) resulting in
HIF activation. Partial global deficiency of HIF-1 α of hypoxia
inducible factor 1α abolished SREBP-1 and SCD-1 up-regulation
and prevented triglyceride accumulation in the liver during IH (Li
et al., 2006). However, HIF-1 is implicated in carotid body activation during IH and the HIF-1α effect may be mediated systemically
via SNS rather than directly on the liver (Peng et al., 2006). Additional insight into the potential role of HIFs in the pathogenesis
of hepatic steatosis during IH has been obtained from mice with
deficiency of Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressive protein in the liver. VHL is required for HIF degradation, therefore
VHL mice exhibit a phenotype of constitutive HIF up-regulation
(Haase et al., 2001; Rankin et al., 2005). VHL deficient mice have
severe hepatic steatosis which was prevented by HIF-2α but not
HIF-1α knockout suggesting that HIF-2 contributes to the pathogenesis of hepatic steatosis (Rankin et al., 2009; Qu et al., 2011).
www.frontiersin.org October 2012 | Volume 3 | Article 149 | 7

Mirrakhimov and Polotsky Obstructive sleep apnea and fatty liver
In the VHL model HIF-2α up-regulated lipid biosynthetic genes
and down-regulated genes of β-oxidation. However, applicability
of findings in the VHL KO model to hepatic steatosis induced
by IH is uncertain. It remains unknown whether up-regulation of
lipogenic genes during IH occurs due to direct activation of HIFs in
the liver or predominantly due to the FFA flux from adipose tissue.
IH AND NASH
Putative mechanisms of NAFLD progression to NASH are depicted
in Figure 2. FFA flux to the liver induced by IH (Drager et al.,
2011; Jun et al., 2011) may up-regulate IκB kinase β resulting
in phosphorylation and degradation of IκB followed by activation of NF-κB and ensuing synthesis of pro-inflammatory
cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 6
(IL-6), macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP-2) and others (Kim et al., 2001; Sinha et al., 2004; Boden et al., 2005; Cai
et al., 2005). We have previously reported activation of NF-κB
in the liver by IH (Savransky et al., 2007c). In the presence of
obesity and hepatic steatosis, IH increased mRNA and protein
levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1, MIP-2 in liver
tissue (Savransky et al., 2007a,b; Drager et al., 2011). It is conceivable that IH and obesity interact to induce NASH via accelerated
adipose tissue lipolysis. However, this hypothesis is yet to be
proven in rodent experiments and clinical studies with lipolysis
inhibitors.
Intermittent hypoxia may also lead to NASH by up-regulating
reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation via NADPH oxidase system (Jun et al., 2008). NADPH oxidase stimulates hepatic stellate
cells to produce collagen via angiotensin II leading to liver fibrosis (Bataller et al., 2003; Novitskiy et al., 2006). NADPH oxidase
can activate NF-κB (Brar et al., 2003). Reactive oxygen may also
directly stimulate NF-κB (Li and Karin, 1999) inducing downstream inflammatory pathways (Ben-Neriah and Karin, 2011).
There is a cross-talk between NF-kB and HIF-1α, which mutually activate each other (Walmsley et al., 2005; Scortegagna et al.,
2008; Taylor and Cummins, 2009). NF-κB and HIF-1 up-regulate
synthesis of collagen, while HIF-1 also induces transcription of
lysyl oxidase resulting in cross-linking of collagen (Novitskiy et al.,
2004; Manalo et al., 2005; Copple et al., 2009, 2011; Haase, 2009).
Paradoxically, HIF-1 may be protective in ischemia-reperfusion
liver injury by preventing hepatocyte apoptosis (Schneider et al.,
2010; Lehwald et al., 2011; Nath and Szabo, 2012). However,
NASH in OSA is a fundamentally different process from ischemiareperfusion injury observed in “shock liver,” which is mediated
by the intricate interplay of systemic and tissue specific processes
described above and in Figure 2.We have previously demonstrated
that IH causes hepatic inflammation and fibrosis in mice with
diet-induced hepatic steatosis (Savransky et al., 2007a; Drager
et al., 2011). We have also shown that IH causes more severe
liver hypoxia in obese mice (Reinke et al., 2011a). It is conceivable that severe liver hypoxia in obese individuals with severe
OSA induces NF-kB and HIF-1 in the liver resulting in steatohepatitis and liver fibrosis. However, this hypothesis is yet to be
tested.
CONCLUSION
Obstructive sleep apnea and NAFLD are common complications
of obesity. The causality of NAFLD has been linked to obesity,
but mechanisms of NAFLD progression to NASH are unknown
and there is no effective treatment. Emerging evidence suggests
that OSA may contribute to the development and progression of
NAFLD to NASH. However, many questions remain unanswered.
First, the causal link between OSA and NAFLD has not been
established. Prospective clinical studies and a randomized placebo
controlled clinical trials of CPAP in patients with NAFLD and
NASH will have to be conducted. Second, mechanisms by which
OSA and IH may lead to NAFLD and NASH remain unclear. The
mouse model of IH will allow to explore such mechanisms utilizing
targeted pharmacological interventions (sympathetic blockade,
antioxidants, and lipolysis inhibitors) and transgenic animals with
liver specific knockouts of gene candidates (HIFs,NADPH oxidase,
NF-κB).
