The liver is known to be a classical immunoprivileged site with a relatively high resistance against immune
responses. Here we demonstrate that highly activated liver-specific effector CD8+ T cells alone were not sufficientto trigger immune destruction ofthe liver in mice. Only additional innate immune signals orchestrated
by TLR3 provoked liver damage. While TLR3 activation did not directly alter liver-specific CD8+ T cell function, it induced IFN-α and TNF-α release. These cytokines generated expression of the chemokine CXCL9 in
the liver, thereby enhancing CD8+ T cell infiltration and liver disease in mice. Thus, nonspecific activation of
innate immunity can drastically enhance susceptibility to immune destruction of a solid organ.
Introduction
The liver represents a so-called immunoprivileged site according 
to its relative resistance against organ rejection after transplantation (1). This is in contrast to the rapid rejection of purified transplanted allogenic hepatocytes in vivo (2). Also, autoimmune hepatitis due to attack by B and T cells is a relatively rare manifestation 
of autoimmune disease (3, 4). Interestingly, diagnostic markers of 
autoimmune hepatitis such as antimitochondrial antibodies are 
also found in healthy people (5). Together, these findings suggest 
that there exist mechanisms protecting immune attack against 
this solid organ. Some studies of immune reactivity against components of solid peripheral organs (such as pancreatic islet cells 
or salivary gland or thyroid antigens) indicate that self-reactive 
effector T or B cells alone may not be sufficient for disease induction without additional “inflammatory signals” being required for 
efficient induction of disease (6). Consistent with clinical observations, results of studies in animal models suggest that naive liverreactive T cells ignore the liver antigen (7) or become tolerized 
within the liver (8, 9). Inflammation (e.g., infection with systemic 
bacteria) may upregulate costimulatory molecules in the liver and 
can break this tolerance (10, 11).
Besides priming of an adaptive immune response, viruses 
can promote inflammatory signals through their ability to 
activate the innate immune system via TLRs (12). Recently it 
was shown that activation of TLR3 or TLR7 (which recognize 
double-stranded and single-stranded RNA [dsRNA and ssRNA], 
respectively) promotes autoimmunity in mice exhibiting high 
frequencies of functional autoreactive CD8+ T cells. Disease 
onset/progression closely correlated with IFN-α production 
(13, 14), suggesting that TLR-induced production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IFN-α and TNF-α may influence the 
development of autoimmunity.
Here we analyzed the requirements of autoimmune liver 
destruction in a mouse model where the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus–glycoprotein1–60 (LCMV-glycoprotein1–60) is 
expressed in the liver as a transgene under the control of the 
mouse albumin promoter (Alb-1 mice) (7).
Results
Requirement of TLR3 signaling for destructive autoimmunity. We injected splenocytes from TCR-Tg 318 mice in which 50% of the CD8+
T cells express a TCR recognizing the LCMV-glycoprotein33–41
epitope presented on H-2Db MHC class I molecules into Alb-1 
mice or control C57BL/6 mice. Without further treatment, those 
T cells virtually ignored the antigen in the liver and did not further expand, with no signs of liver damage (Figure 1A and Supplemental Figure 1; supplemental material available online with this 
article; doi:10.1172/JCI28349DS1) (7). Infection of such recipient 
mice with 200 PFU of the LCMV strain WE (LCMV-WE) caused 
massive expansion of gp33-specific CD8+ T cells, as detected by 
gp33 tetramer binding (7) (Figure 1B), and resulted in liver injury 
as determined by increased serum activity of alanine amino-transferase (ALT) and high bilirubin serum concentration (7) (Figure 
1B). In this experimental model, LCMV induces both a strong 
adaptive T cell response against liver antigens and a strong innate 
immune response. To separately analyze the influence of this 
innate activation, we immunized mice with gp33 peptide together 
with the TLR9 ligand CpG (ODN-1826). This treatment resulted 
in a similar expansion of tetramer-positive T cells but only a small 
increase in ALT and undetectable bilirubin in the serum (Figure 
1C). CpG (ODN-1826) is a ligand for TLR9, and its binding to 
TLR9 results in DC activation and upregulation of costimulatory 
molecules (15) but does not induce massive IFN-α production. 
In contrast, LCMV, CpG (ODN-2216), and the RNA repeat polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)] activate innate immunity 
and result in production of IFN-α (16, 17). We therefore tested 
whether poly(I:C) could mimic the ability of replicating LCMV in 
promoting liver disease. Mice adoptively transferred with autoreactive TCR-Tg 318 CD8+ T cells were immunized on days 0 and 
4 with gp33 plus CpG (ODN-1826). Peptide priming without

CpG (ODN-1826) also expanded TCR-Tg CD8+ T cells (data not 
shown); however, gp33 plus CpG (ODN-1826) yielded maximal 
T cell responses. After priming of TCR-Tg CD8+ T cells, 1 group of 
mice was additionally treated with poly(I:C) on day 7. Administration of poly(I:C) resulted in a rapid elevation of ALT and bilirubin 
in the serum, indicating hepatocyte destruction (Figure 1C). In 
separate experiments, peptide-treated mice were further treated 
with the IFN-α–inducing CpG (ODN-2216) on day 7. This activation of TLR9 resulted in a mild but significant increase in ALT, 
suggesting that other TLRs may also be able to trigger hepatitis 
(Supplemental Figure 2).
Induction of type I interferons can result in upregulation of 
MHC class I molecules on pancreatic islet cells, which correlates with onset of autoimmune diabetes (14, 18). In contrast, 
hepatocytes have been described as constitutively expressing abundant surface MHC class I (19), which was not further affected by 
interferon (Supplemental Figure 3). Thus, antigen presentation on 
MHC class I molecules did not explain the observed differences in 
immunologically induced liver destruction.
TLR3-independent CD8+ T cell effector function. Our findings might 
be explained by enhanced CD8+ T cell function as a consequence 
of TLR3 engagement. To investigate this possibility, we transfused 
naive C57BL/6 mice with 107 gp33-specific TCR-Tg CD8+ T cells 
and immunized recipient mice with gp33 plus CpG (ODN-1826) on 
days 0 and 4, with or without additional treatment with poly(I:C) 
on day 7. Thereafter, autoreactive CD8+ T cells were identified by 
tetramer binding and their expression of various activation markers analyzed by FACS analysis. First we analyzed the early activation 
markers CD25 and CD69. There was a weak expression of CD25 in 
both groups (Figure 2A). During treatment with poly(I:C), a subset 
of gp33-specific CD8 T cells upregulated CD69, known to be a 
target molecule of type I interferon (20). CD8+ T cells from either 
control or poly(I:C)-treated mice showed no difference in other 
activation markers (Figure 2B), nor were any differences observed 
in the ability of these cells to produce IFN-γ or to express granzyme B following in vitro restimulation with gp33 peptide (Figure 2C). To examine whether poly(I:C) affected effector function 
of CD8+ T cells, we performed in vitro and in vivo killing assays. 
Both mice primed with peptide and CpG (ODN-1826) alone and 
mice additionally treated with poly(I:C) generated effector CD8+
T cells capable of lysing gp33-labeled target cells in vivo and in 
vitro (Figure 2, D and E). Staining of the effector protein granzyme B directly ex vivo revealed no significant difference between 
tet-gp33+ T cells treated with and without poly(I:C) (Figure 2F). 
Recently it has been shown that CD8+ T cells can express FoxP3 
and have regulatory function (21). Peptide priming might also 
induce a regulatory status in gp33-specific CD8 T cells. However, 
we did not observe expression of FoxP3 in gp33-specific cells (Supplemental Figure 4). We found that in both C57BL/6 and Alb-1 
mice, CD4+CD25+ T cells were present in the liver after LCMV 
infection (Supplemental Figure 4). Therefore, we examined whether peptide treatment followed by poly(I:C) treatment had an effect 
on frequencies of Tregs. While peptide treatment did not result in 
any significant change in CD4+ Tregs, we have monitored a slight 
increase in CD25+FoxP3+CD4+ T cells after poly(I:C) treatment in 
the liver. We therefore concluded that TLR3 signals did not induce 
hepatitis by directly altering liver-specific CD8+ T cell function or 
by downregulation of Treg subsets.
Effects of TLR3 ligation on liver gene expression. To determine factors 
responsible for poly(I:C)-induced autoimmunity, we performed

gene array experiments. Thirty-eight genes that were likely to 
influence autoimmune disease were selected for analysis. These 
genes were involved in cell survival and apoptosis, signaling, T cell 
migration, or antiviral activity. RNA analysis was performed on 
liver samples taken from naive or poly(I:C)-treated C57BL/6 mice 
as described in Methods. Only one gene out of the selected 38, 
CXC chemokine ligand 9 (Cxcl9), showed an increased expression of 
greater than 10-fold following poly(I:C) treatment (Table 1). The 
expression of several other genes was upregulated by a factor of 
2- to 10-fold. These included the signaling molecule interferon regulatory factor 7 (Irf-7), antiviral molecules Mx-1 and Usp18, adhesion 
molecules Vcam-1 and Icam-1, the inflammatory cytokine Tnf-α, 
the chemokine Cxcl10, and the antiinflammatory cytokine Il-10
(Table 1). In addition, we found more than 2-fold upregulation of 
Il-7, Fas-ligand, and Igfbp5.
Poly(I:C) induced upregulation of mRNA for Cxcl9, Vcam-1, and 
Icam-1 as determined by quantitative RT-PCR of cDNA generated 
from liver tissue (Figure 3A). Additional immunohistological 
analysis indicated that ICAM-1 was expressed constitutively in 
the liver in naive animals (data not shown). In contrast, expression of VCAM-1 or CXCL9 was limited in livers of naive mice. 
However, expression was detectable following poly(I:C) treatment 
(data not shown). The ability to upregulate CXCL9 expression 
was TLR3 dependent. This was confirmed by poly(I:C) treatment 
of Tlr3–/– mice, which exhibited reduced upregulation (Figure 3B). 
This effect was mediated through TLR3 ligation on bone marrow–
derived cells but not on hepatocytes, as Tlr3–/– bone marrow transferred into irradiated TLR3-competent mice (Tlr3–/–→BALB/c) 
yielded a reduced Cxcl9 expression similar to that in control
Tlr3–/– mice. TLR3-competent bone marrow transferred into irradiated Tlr3–/– mice (BALB/c→Tlr3–/–) resulted in Cxcl9 expression 
similar to that in wild-type control mice (Figure 3B). Loss of TLR3 
did not completely abolish poly(I:C)-induced Cxcl9 expression, 
possibly due to the activation of other molecules, e.g., retinoic 
acid–inducible gene I (RIG-I), which can recognize dsRNA (22). 
To analyze the role of TLR3-induced cytokines such as interferons 
and TNF-α in upregulation of Cxcl9 and Vcam-1, mice deficient in 
receptors for type I or type II interferons or TNF-α were employed. 
Both IFN-α and TNF-α were produced following poly(I:C) administration (Table 1 and Supplemental Figure 5), and the absence 
of receptors for either factor abolished the ability of poly(I:C) to 
induce Cxcl9 upregulation (Figure 3C). No role for type II interferons (IFN-γ) was found, since mice deficient in interferon type 
II receptors (Ifngr–/–) revealed responses comparable to those in 
wild-type mice following poly(I:C) treatment (Figure 3C). Vcam-1
expression appeared to be regulated solely by TNF-α, with no 
obvious role observed for either type I or type II interferons (Figure 3D). Taken together, the results suggest that TLR3 engagement on bone marrow–derived cells changed liver expression of 
T cell–attracting molecules.
Enhanced CD8+ T cell recruitment into the liver by TLR3 ligation. The 
upregulation of genes involved in T cell homing prompted us 
to investigate whether poly(I:C) treatment resulted in increased 
T cell migration into the liver in vivo. It was likely that CXCL9 
could attract memory T cells, as most of the CD44+CD8+ T cells 
in C57BL/6 mice expressed its receptor CXCR3 (Figure 3E). Treatment with poly(I:C) diminished staining of CXCR3 on memory

splenocytes from LCMV-gp33/H-2Db–specific TCR-Tg 318 mice were 
injected i.v. into naive C57BL/6 mice. Mice were immunized with gp33 
(1 mg in PBS) and CpG on days 0 and 4. A separate group of mice was 
additionally treated with poly(I:C) on day 7. The phenotype and function of CD8+ T cells were analyzed 24 hours (A–E; n = 3 per group) or 
12 hours (F; n = 2–3 per group) later. (A) Splenocytes were analyzed 
by FACS for early activation marker CD25 and CD69. Histogram plots 
show cells gated on CD8 and Thy1.1 (marker for 318 T cells). Gray 
shading indicates staining with isotype control antibody. Values for 
FACS analysis give mean fluorecence intensity (MFI). For other plots in 
A, B, and C, the number of positive expressing cells (marked by bar or 
quadrant) are given. (B) Splenocytes were further analyzed for surface 
expression of CD44, CD62L, IL-7Rα, and VLA-4 (CD49d). Histogram 
plots show cells gated for CD8 expression and tet-gp33 expression 
(indicated by a black line) or tet-gp33–negative cells (control expression, indicated by gray shading). (C) Splenocytes were restimulated in 
vitro with or without gp33, then analyzed for intracellular expression of 
granzyme B and IFN-γ. Dot plots show cells gated for CD8 expression. 
(D and E) Splenocytes were analyzed for their ability to lyse peptideloaded target cells in vitro (D) or in vivo (E). Naive splenocytes served 
as negative control; splenocytes from mice infected with 2 × 106 pfu of 
LCMV-WE (WE high) served as positive control. (F) Eight hours after 
treatment with poly(I:C), splenocytes were analyzed for their expression of granzyme B (n = 2–3).

CD8+ T cells (Figure 3E), suggesting binding of its ligand CXCL9 
and consequent downregulation of CXCR3 (23). To analyze homing of gp33-specific cells, we transferred 107 TCR-Tg 318 splenocytes into C57BL/6 recipients, followed by immunization with 
gp33 on days 0 and 4 together with CpG, with or without additional poly(I:C) treatment on day 7. Again, poly(I:C) treatment induced 
an upregulation of Cxcl9 and Vcam-1, suggesting that peptide treatment had no influence on CXCL9 and VCAM-1 upregulation in the 
liver (Figure 3, F and G). After peptide priming, most gp33-specific 
cells were found to express CXCR3, which was also downregulated 
following poly(I:C) treatment (Figure 3H). gp33-specific CD8+ T 
cells were recruited from the blood twelve hours after poly(I:C) 
treatment (Figure 3I) and were found within the liver in increased 
numbers in Alb-1 mice (Figure 3J). Together these data suggest that 
an innate immune activation by poly(I:C) recruits CD8 T cells into 
the liver, which subsequently leads to liver damage.
Role of innate signals in virus-induced hepatitis. To investigate the 
role of IFN-α in virus-induced hepatitis, we crossed the Alb-1 onto 
Ifnar–/– mice. A total of 107 TCR-Tg 318 splenocytes were transferred on day –1 into Alb-1+ Ifnar–/– mice or littermate control mice 
(Alb-1+ Ifnar+/– or Alb-1+ Ifnar+/+), followed by infection with 200 
pfu LCMV on day 0. Lack of IFN-α signaling resulted in an inability to clear the virus (Figure 4A), and as a consequence all mice died 
of generalized immune pathology by day 7 (data not shown). The 
transferred CD8+ T cells expressing type I interferon receptor could 
raise a functional T cell response (24) (Figure 4B). In littermate 
control mice, immunohistologically demonstrated T cell infiltrations in the periportal liver areas correlated with increased serum 
bilirubin concentrations, reflecting liver damage. Despite high 
viral load in the liver, LCMV-infected Alb-1+ Ifnar–/– mice demonstrated a reduced infiltration of T cells into periportal liver areas 
(Figure 4A), correlating well with reduced Cxcl9 expression within 
the liver of Ifnar–/– mice (Figure 4D). The lack of T cell infiltration 
into the periportal area of the liver also correlated with reduced 
serum bilirubin concentrations (Figure 4C).
We next tested whether T cell migration into the liver could be 
inhibited while preserving the beneficial antiviral function of IFN-α.
For this purpose, we used pertussis toxin (PTX), which acts as a 
inhibitor of all G protein–coupled chemokine receptors (23). PTXtreated, LCMV-infected mice no longer displayed CD8+ T cell accumulation within the liver (Figure 4E), did not develop liver disease 
(Figure 4F), and showed limited virus antigen in the liver (Figure 
4E). To rule out the possibility that PTX treatment affected CD8+
T cell priming, we investigated the ability of CD8+ T cells isolated 
from control or PTX-treated mice to lyse gp33-loaded target cells in 
vitro. PTX treatment did not alter the CTL activity of gp33-specific 
CD8+ T cells (Figure 4G). Analysis of gp33-specific CD8+ T cells 
indicated that PTX-treated Alb-1 mice contained more circulating 
cells expressing high levels of the IL-7 receptor α (IL-7Rα) chain
(Figure 4H). Since IL-7Rα downregulation is indicative of recent 
antigenic stimulation (25), these data imply that gp33-specific 
CD8+ T cells in Alb-1 mice receiving PTX did not interact with their 
antigen, likely resulting from the lack of migration into the liver.
Discussion
The immunoprivileged status of the liver may be built of more than 
one mechanism. Immune destruction of the liver requires first the 
priming of liver-specific T cells. These activated T cells then have to 
migrate into the target organ, where autoimmunity finally occurs. 
T cell priming has been proposed to be controlled by costimulatory 
factors, innate immune signals, and Tregs (26, 27). The findings 
presented here strongly suggested that there exists a second line of 
immunoprivilege in the liver. Usually, the liver does not attract liverspecific T cells because chemokines are expressed at low levels in 
the liver. Thus, even though highly active liver-specific T cells were 
found at high frequencies in the blood, few migrated into the liver. 
Our present study further demonstrates that proinflammatory signals derived from ligation of TLR3 can lead to homing of CD8+ T 
cells to the liver with subsequent enhancement of liver disease. The 
mechanism by which TLR3 signaling promoted disease involved 
IFN-α– and TNF-α–dependent upregulation of genes and their 
products involved in T cell homing and migration. This pathogenic 
mechanism may explain earlier observations that autoimmunity, 
including hepatitis, was promoted by Listeria infection (10).

Three of 6 naive C57BL/6 mice were treated with 500 mg poly(I:C). After 24 hours, livers were removed, and mRNA was isolated. For every individual liver, 
RT-PCR assay was performed to determine expression levels of genes involved in T cell homing, inflammation, T cell survival, apoptosis, signaling, and 
antiviral activity, which were normalized to the housekeeping gene 18S RNA (see Methods). Thirty-eight of 48 genes showed measurable gene expression. 
The fold difference between the median expression in 3 naive mice and the median expression in 3 poly(I:C)-treated mice was calculated. AVcam-1 and 
Icam-1 were measured separately and were not included on a gene array (raw data are shown in Figure 3A). All other genes were analyzed in an RT-PCR 
array. Analyzed genes were sorted according to the expression difference between naive and poly(I:C)-treated mice and designated as: “highly increased”

Our findings are in accordance with previous observations indicating that expression of CXCR3 on T cells is required for the 
onset of autoimmune diabetes (28) and implicate TLR-induced 
chemokine production as a mechanism by which inflammation 
can be generated, resulting in exacerbated hepatitis (29, 30).
The most dramatic effect of TLR ligation on liver cells was the 
upregulation of CXCL9, which was dependent on production of 
type I interferon and TNF-α. These findings suggest that treatment 
of chronic HCV infection with interferon (31) may enhance infiltration of T cells in the liver and that although this may help to reduce 
viral load, it could aggravate liver destruction and cirrhosis (32) or 
accelerate the course of recurrent disease after transplantation.
We found that PTX-mediated inhibition of chemokine signaling provoked infiltration of only a small number of T cells and 
strongly reduced liver enzyme release and serum bilirubin concentrations. Virus was limited but still detectable. This finding 
correlates with a genetic polymorphism characterized by reduced 
chemokine signaling and chronic HCV infection in humans (33). 
From this data we would suggest that the inhibition of chemokine 
signaling in combination with interferon therapy might be a possible strategy for the treatment of chronic infection with HBV or 
HCV or disease recurrence following liver transplantation.
Tregs have been proposed to play an important role in the prevention of autoimmune disease and inflammatory processes (34). Here 
we have demonstrated a rise in the number of CD25+FoxP3+CD4+
T cells after LCMV infection in Alb-1 mice (Supplemental Figure 
4). Also, poly(I:C) treatment slightly increased the number of Tregs 
in the liver (Supplemental Figure 4). While the increase in Tregs

cannot explain the induction of hepatitis, it might be required for 
the observed downregulation of disease after day 7.
TNF-α–induced CXCL9 may play a role in human hepatitis, as 
there is a direct link between a mutation in the TNF-α locus and 
autoimmune hepatitis (35). These clinical observations together with 
our data suggest that inhibition of chemokines may prove an interesting therapeutic approach against immune hepatitis in humans.
In conclusion, the presented experiments revealed that highly 
activated CD8+ T cells can “peacefully” coexist with hepatocytes 
expressing the relevant autoantigen without causing overt disease. Engagement of TLR3 was required to break this immunoprivileged state of the liver and converted autoreactivity into overt 
autoimmune disease and organ destruction. Taken together, our 
results have identified TLR3 as one important mechanism of solid 
organ immune privilege.
Methods
Mice and viruses. LCMV strain WE was originally obtained from F. Lehmann-Grube (Heinrich Pette Institute, Hamburg, Germany) and was 
propagated in L929 cells. Virus titers were measured using a plaque-forming assay as described previously (36). Mice were infected with 200 PFU 
LCMV-WE. Mice transgenic for a TCR recognizing LCMV-glycoprotein33–41 
(LCMV-gp33/H-2Db–specific TCR, 318 mice), Alb-1 mice (7), Myd88–/–, 
and Tnfr1–/– mice were maintained on the C57BL/6 genetic background, 
while Ifngr–/– mice were of the 129Sv background. Ifnar–/– mice were of the 
129Sv or of the C57BL/6 background (for crossings to Alb-1). Tlr3–/– mice 
were on the BALB/c background. For generation of bone marrow chimeras, recipient mice were irradiated with 9.50 Gy on day –1. On day 0, 107
bone marrow cells were transferred i.v., and mice were used for experiments 7 weeks later. All experiments were performed with animals housed 
in ventilated cages. Animal experiments were approved and authorized by 
Figure 4
Homing is crucial for LCMV-induced autoimmune hepatitis. (A–C) 107 splenocytes from 
LCMV-gp33/H-2Db–specific TCR-Tg 318 
mice were transferred i.v. into Alb-1+ Ifnar–/–
mice (C57BL/6 background) and littermate 
controls (Alb-1+ Ifnar+/– or Alb-1+ Ifnar+/+) on 
day –1. Recipients were immunized with 200 
pfu LCMV on day 0. (A) On day 7, Alb-1+
Ifnar–/– mice died, and livers were analyzed for CD8+ T cell infiltration and LCMV 
nucleoprotein (LCMV-NP) by immunohistology (magnification, ×100). (B) CD8+ T 
cells were analyzed by tetramer staining 
and in an in vitro CTL assay. (C) Serum 
was analyzed for bilirubin concentrations, 
alkaline phosphatase activity (a marker for 
bile cholestasis), and ALT activity (n = 3 per 
group). (D) Ifnar–/– mice (Sv129 background 
without transfer of 318 T cells) and corresponding control mice were infected with 
200 pfu LCMV-WE. After 7 days, livers 
were analyzed for expression of CXCL9. 
*P > 0.05. (E–H) 107 splenocytes from 
LCMV-gp33/H-2Db–specific TCR-Tg 318 
mice were transferred i.v. into naive Alb-1 
mice or C57BL/6 mice on day –1. Recipients 
were then infected with 200 PFU LCMV-WE 
on day 0. One group was further treated with 
0.5 μg of PTX on days 0 and 3. (E) On day 
6, liver sections were analyzed for CD8+ T 
cell infiltration or for viral antigen (LCMVNP) by histology (magnification, ×100; n = 2 
per group). Serum was analyzed for bilirubin concentration and ALT activity (n = 4 per 
group) (F), and CD8+ T cell effector function 
was assessed by an in vitro CTL assay (G). 
(H) Autoreactive CD8+ T cells and their IL-7Rα
expression were analyzed in the blood 
(n = 4 per group).

Swiss animal protection law.
PTX treatment. For inhibition of G protein–coupled chemokine signaling, 
0.5 µg PTX (Sigma-Aldrich) was administered i.v. on days 0 and 3.
Immunization with peptides or TLR ligands and adoptive transfer of CD8+ T cells.
gp33 peptide (KAVYNFATM) was synthesized by Neosystems. For priming 
of LCMV-gp33/H-2Db–specific TCR-Tg CD8+ T cells, 107 splenocytes were 
adoptively transferred to Alb-1 mice or C57BL/6 mice on day –1, and mice 
were immunized with 1 mg gp33 together with CpG (ODN-1826) (50 µg; 
Coley) on days 0 and 4. To analyze the influence of TLRs, we treated mice 
with the TLR3 ligand poly(I:C) (500 µg; Sigma-Aldrich) or the TLR9 ligand 
CpG (ODN-2216) (100 µg; TIB MOLBIOL).
Cytotoxicity assay. 51Cr release assays were performed as previously 
described (36) and supernatants analyzed after 8 hours. Assays for in vivo 
cytotoxicity were performed using C57BL/6 splenocytes incubated for 
1 hour with or without gp33 and labeled for 10 minutes with 5 µg/ml 
(peptide-labeled splenocytes) or 0.5 µg/ml (unlabeled splenocytes) CFSE 
(Invitrogen), respectively. A total of 107 cells of each fraction was injected 
intravenously, and the number of CFSE-positive cells remaining in the 
spleen after 2 hours was determined by FACS analysis.
Histology. Histological analyses were performed on snap-frozen tissue. Sections were stained with rat mAbs against murine MHC class I (M1/42), ICAM-1 
(CD54, KAT-1; AbD Serotec), VCAM-1 (CD106, M/K-2; AbD Serotec), CD8 
(53-6.7; BD Biosciences), or VL4, an mAb against the LCMV nucleoprotein. 
Sections were further stained with goat anti-CXCL9 (MIG; R&D Systems) 
and anti-Thy1.1 antibody (CD90.1, HIS51; BD Biosciences). Staining was 
developed using a goat anti-rat antibody (R40000; Caltag Laboratories) 
and an alkaline phosphatase–coupled donkey anti-goat antibody (705-
055-147; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc.) with naphthol AS-BI 
(6-bromo-2-hydroxy-3-naphtholic acid 2-methoxy anilide) phosphate and 
new fuchsin as a substrate. The sections were counterstained with hemalum.
Bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and ALT. Concentrations were measured using a serum multiple biochemical analyzer (Ektachem DTSCII; 
Johnson & Johnson).
IFN-α ELISA. IFN-α ELISA was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Research Diagnostics Inc.).
FACS analysis. Tetramers were produced and FACS analysis were performed as described previously (36). Briefly, splenocytes or peripheral 
blood lymphocytes were stained using PE-labeled gp33 MHC class I tetramers (gp33/H-2Db) for 15 minutes at 37°C, followed by staining with 
anti–CD8-PerCP (BD Biosciences) for 30 minutes at 4°C. For determination of their activation status, lymphocytes were stained with anti-CD25, 
anti-CD69, anti-CD62L, anti-CD44, anti–VLA-4, and anti–IL-7Rα (BD 
Biosciences — Pharmingen) or anti-CXCR3 (R&D Systems) for 30 minutes 
at 4°C. For staining of Tregs, anti-FoxP3 antibody was used (eBioscience).
mRNA gene profiling by quantitative RT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from 
liver tissue using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s 
instructions. RNA was transcribed using ThermoScript RT-PCR System 
kit (Invitrogen) or a 1-step RT-PCR kit (Applied Biosystems). Predesigned 
TaqMan low-density arrays (format 48x8 [part no. 4342253], micro fluidic 
cards; Applied Biosystems) were used in a 2-step RT-PCR process using 
the ABI Prism 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) 
with a TaqMan Low Density Array Upgrade (Applied Biosystems). Loading 
of the low-density arrays, standard thermal cycling conditions, and data 
acquisition were done according to the manufacturer’s suggestions. Quantitative real-time PCR amplification of single genes was performed using 
an ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detector System (Applied Biosystems). TaqMan gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems) for TNF-α (assay ID Mm 
00443258_m), VCAM-1 (assay ID Mm 00449197_m1), ICAM-1 (assay ID 
Mm00516023_m1), and Cxcl9 (assay ID Mm00434946_m1) were used for 
quantification of mRNA expression of the respective genes. For analysis, 
expression levels of target genes were normalized to the housekeeping gene 
18S rRNA (ΔCt) or UBE2D2. Gene expression values were then calculated 
based on the ΔΔCt method, with data for all samples analyzed against the 
mean value for 3 untreated mice. Relative quantities (RQ) were determined 
using the equation: RQ = 2–ΔΔCt.
Statistics. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. For statistical analysis, 
1-tailed Student’s t test was used, and P values < 0.05 were considered 
statistically significant.
