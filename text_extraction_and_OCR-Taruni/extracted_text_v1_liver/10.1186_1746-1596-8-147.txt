Abstract
Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IMTs) are categorized as intermediate biologic neoplasms, whereas IMTs with
genetic features of ran-binding protein 2 (RANBP2) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement (IMT-RAs)
are possibly related to a more aggressive clinical course. However, fewer than 10 cases of IMT-RA have been
reported to date. Herein, we present 2 new cases of IMT-RA in which both tumors recurred quickly after primary
surgery; one patient died 3 months later from the disease, and the other patient has been living with the disease
for 12 months. IMT-RAs are characterized by noncohesive epithelioid and rounded tumoral cell morphology,
commonly derived from pelvic and peritoneal cavities, and frequently show larger tumor sizes. The relation
between the clinicopathologic features and poor prognosis of IMT-RA is discussed.

Background
Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IMTs) are mesenchymal neoplasms of intermediate biologic potential that
are derived from myofibroblastic cells and accompanied
by rich inflammatory infiltrates [1]. IMTs have a predilection for children and adolescents, and the most common anatomical locations are the abdominopelvic
region, lung, and retroperitoneum. IMTs show expression of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) protein triggered by ALK gene (at 2p23) rearrangement, which has
been found in 36–60% of IMTs [2]. ALK fusion oncogenes have been identified in a small proportion of
IMTs, including SEC31L1 at 4q21, ATIC at 2q35, CARS
at 11p15, TPM3 at 1p23, TMP4 at 19p13, CLTC at
17q23, PPFIBP1 at 12p11, and ran-binding protein 2
(RANBP2) at 2q13 [3]. Different fusion partners may
lead to distinct subcellular locations of the corresponding chimeric protein, which result in distinct immunostaining patterns when detected by ALK antibody. IMTs
with CARS, ATIC, and SEC31L1 fusion are generally associated with smooth cytoplasmic staining, whereas fusion with CLTC, a main structural protein of coated
vesicles, displays a granular cytoplasmic pattern [4].
RANBP2 fuses with the ALK gene through balanced or
unbalanced translocation [5]. The RANBP2 gene encodes
a 358-kd nuclear pore protein [6], thus IMTs with
RANBP2-ALK (IMT-RA) rearrangement display a unique
nuclear membrane staining pattern. Most importantly,
IMT-RA is possibly associated with a poor prognosis;
however, this relation remains inconclusive, as fewer than
10 cases of IMTs with genetically confirmed RANBP2-
ALK fusion have been reported to date [5,7-11]. Herein,
we present 2 new cases of IMT-RA with follow-up information. The relations between the histopathologic features and prognosis of IMT-RAs are discussed further.
Case presentation
Case 1 was a 19-year-old female who was hospitalized
due to paroxysmal abdominal pain combined with nausea and vomiting for 4 days. Ultrasound examination
showed a 19 × 17 × 11 cm solid mass in the pelvic cavity
and medium amounts of ascitic fluid. Intraoperatively,

the tumor was situated in the mesenterium region of the
terminal ileum, and had locally invaded into the adjacent
ileum wall. Resections of the tumor, affected terminal
ileum, and ileocecum were performed. The patient
rejected further chemotherapy. Nine weeks after the
operation, radiological imaging displayed recurrent
intra-abdominal occupations with massive ascites. Concurrently, acute renal insufficiency was identified by laboratory tests. The patient died of the disease after
3 weeks of maintenance treatment.
Case 2 was a 39-year-old male with an initial complaint of laborious urination for more than 2 months
and abdominal distention and abdominal pain for
10 days. Computer Tomography (CT) revealed a 15 ×
10 × 8 cm occupation in the pelvic cavity (Figure 1). The
neoplasm was found in the mesangial region at the junction of sigmoid and rectum during the operation, with
invasions of the neighboring sigmoid, the upper portion
of the rectum, and left ureter. The tumor and afflicted
intestines and left ureter were completely excised. The
patient was treated with epirubicin and iphosphamide
following the operation. Four months after the first excision, CT showed multiple recurrent masses in the
presacral, pararectal, and left iliac vessel regions. The
patient then underwent chemoembolization therapy.
Follow-up has continued to date, and the patient has
lived with the tumor for 12 months.
Histopathological and genetic findings
The gross and histological features were similar in Case
1 and Case 2. The tumors were solid and gray-yellowish
in the cut surface. Focal hemorrhage and a myxomatous
appearance were observed. Microscopically, the neoplasm showed a fasciitis-like pattern and the stromal
myxoid change was prominent (Figure 2A, B). The
tumor cells were generally non-cohesive, and frequently
demonstrated ganglion-like morphology of slightly
amphophilic cytoplasm, vesicular chromatin, and large
nucleoli (Figure 2C). There were also a few binucleate
cells sparsely presented in the lesion (Figure 2D). In area
of the neoplasm, some tumor cells were tightly packed
and arranged in sheets (Figure 2E). The mitotic figures
ranged from 1 to 4 per 10 high-power fields. There were
abundant admixed polymorphs infiltrates, including neutrophils, eosinophils, and lymphoplasma cells, which
were unevenly distributed throughout the lesion.
Erythrocyte extravasation was another feature found in
both cases. The tumor invaded the adjacent intestinal
tissues, involving the adventitia, muscularis propria, and
submucosa with a vague nodular pattern (Figure 2F).
Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells showed distinctive nuclear membrane staining for ALK (Dako; Clone
ALK1; Ready-to-use) (Figure 3A) in both cases. Similarly,
positive staining for CD30 (Dako; Clone Ber-H2; 1:40 dilution) (Figure 3B), desmin (Dako; Clone D33; 1:100 dilution) (Figure 3C), and SMA (Dako; Clone 1A4; 1:100
dilution) was also observed in some tumor cells in the 2
cases. In both cases, the tumor cells were nonreactive to
AE1/AE3 (Dako; Clone AE1 + AE3; 1:200 dilution),
cytokeratin 8/18 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; Clone NCL5D3; 1:100 dilution), CD117 (Dako; polyclonal; 1:100 dilution), calponin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; Clone CALP;

1:200 dilution), S100 (Dako; polyclonal; 1:500 dilution),
CD21 (Dako; Clone 1 F8; 1:25 dilution), HMB45 (Dako;
1:50 dilution), myogenin (Dako; Clone F5D; 1:50 dilution),
and Myf4 (Novocastra; Clone LO26; 1:500 dilution).
Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed
on 4 μm-thick tissue sections with bacterial artificial
chromosome probes for RANBP2 (RP11-348G16) and
ALK (RP11-984I21 and RP11-62B19). In both cases, 1
fused signal was observed in the tumor cell nucleus, indicating the presence of RANBP2 and ALK gene rearrangement (Figure 3D) by unbalanced genetic rearrangement
mechanism [5].
To pinpoint the fusion location of the RANBP2 and
ALK genes, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis was performed. Total RNA was
extracted from 15 μm-thick paraffin sections using the
RNeasy® FFPE kit (QIAGEN, Germany), and reversetranscribed using random hexamer primers. PCR was
performed using previously introduced primers [8] for
45 cycles as follows: 94°C for 30 seconds, 60°C for 30 seconds, and 72°C for 30 seconds. An expected 254-bp
amplification product was detected in Case 2 (Figure 4A).
No PCR product was identified in Case 1, which may be
due to RNA degradation in the paraffin-embedded block
since positive amplification results (285-bp) of beta-actin
as a householding gene were not found either in Case 1
but present in Case 2 (Figure 4B). Direct sequencing of
the chimeric cDNA product confirmed that the
RANBP2-ALK fusion point was composed of exon 18 of
RANBP2 to exon 20 of ALK (Figure 4C).
Discussion
IMT is regarded as a neoplasm of intermediate biologic
potential. Overall, the recurrence rate varies by anatomical sites, from 2% for tumors confined to the lung to
25% for extrapulmonary lesions. Distant metastasis of

IMT occurs in less than 5% of cases [12]. According to
the literature and the 2 cases presented herein (Table 1),
the local recurrence rate of IMT-RA is 88% (7/8) with a
metastasis rate of 25% (2/8), both markedly higher than
those of conventional IMTs. Furthermore, 2 patients
(25%, 2/8) have died from the disease within 6 months
after the tumor excision. These data suggest that IMTRAs are more invasive clinically.
The aggressive behavior of IMT-RA might be associated
with the following aspects: (1) The location and size of the
tumor: Coffin et al. [13] analyzed the clinicopathologic
features of IMTs with an invasive course, and found that
IMTs that arise in the abdominopelvic site are more likely
to recur (with a recurrence rate of 85%). In addition, recurrent and metastatic IMTs were commonly larger in
size, with mean diameters of 8.7 and 11 cm, respectively.
Of the 11 reported cases of IMT-RAs, 10 occurred in the
abdominopelvic area, and only 1 presented in the pleural
cavity (no follow-up data were provided in the case). The
average size on discovery was 14.6 cm. Thus, the aggressiveness of IMT-RA is possibly related at least in part to
its abdominopelvic origination and bigger tumor size. It is

immunostaining (A), cytomembranous CD30 immunostaining (B), and cytoplasmic desmin immunostaining (C) (A and B, 400× original
magnification; C, 200× original magnification). (D) Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed 1 fused signal (arrow) in the tumor
nucleus, indicating the presence of RANBP2-ALK translocation. One separate orange signal and 1 separate green signal indicated a normal ALK
and a normal RANBP2 locus, respectively (1000× original magnification).

was located between exon 18 of the RANBP2 gene and exon 20 of the ALK gene.

worth noting that IMT-RA seemingly prefers to afflict
male patients, as the male to female ratio is 10:1.
(2) The histological features of the tumor: The morphology of IMT-RAs is generally uniform and characterized
by loosely arrayed, ganglion-like or epithelioid neoplastic
cells distributed in a widespread myxoid stroma. In earlier
reports, IMTs with the aforementioned features were
named round cell transformation [14]. It has been well
demonstrated that IMTs with round cell transformation
behave aggressively with rapid recurrence and/or death,
compared to conventional IMTs in which spindled
tumoral cells predominate [14]. Marino-Enriquez [10]
proposed to designate this type of IMT as epithelioid inflammatory myofibroblastic sarcoma based on its histological and malignant biological characteristics. Therefore,
the distinctive histology of IMT-RAs dominated by
epithilioid neoplastic cells also intrinsically reflects the
heightened invasiveness of the tumor. However, it should
be particularly noted that not all IMTs with round cell
morphology carry the genetic alteration of IMT-RA [8].
Therefore, it is inappropriate to diagnosis IMT-RA based
solely on morphologic features.
(3) The genetic features of the tumor: The fusion point
of IMT-RAs reported to date constantly presents between exon 18 of RANPB2 and exon 20 of ALK (Table 2).
Sasaki [15] found that the RANPB2-ALK fusion gene
could lead to interleukin (IL)-3 independent growth of
Ba/F3 cells. Similarly, another study showed that bone
marrow cells transfected with the RANBP2-ALK gene
acquired an enhanced colony-forming potential and a
decreased dependency on cytokine [16]. These studies
suggested that the chimeric RANPB2-ALK gene could
promote cellular proliferation, which might be a potential mechanism for the rapid regrowth and recurrence of
IMT-RA. However, there is still a lack of direct experimental evidence linking the functions of this fusion gene
with the increased aggressiveness of IMT-RA.
From a diagnostic viewpoint, IMT-RA needs to be differentiated from a large group of tumors that manifest
epithelioid features. Immunohistochemistry is greatly
helpful in this process. Nuclear membrane staining of
ALK is a unique immunophenotype of IMT-RA, which
is observed in 82% (9/11) of cases. Unexplainably, a
cytoplasmic pattern is also detected in 18% (2/11) of
cases. In addition, the neoplasms display varied expression of desmin (89%, 8/9), CD30 (71%, 5/7), SMA (50%,
4/8), and cytokeratin (25%, 2/8), while EMA, S100,
CD117, Myf4, myogenin, caldesmin, and HMB45 expression is consistently negative. Therefore, IMT-RAs could
be easily distinguished from poorly differentiated carcinoma, malignant melanoma, epithelioid gastrointestinal
stromal tumor, epithelioid solitary fibrous tumor [17],

myofibroma [18] and alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. It is
noteworthy that a few mesenchymal mimics listed below
may also show cytoplasmic ALK staining [19] and thus
should particularly be discriminated to avoid misdiagnosis. (1) Epithelioid leiomyosarcoma (ELS): Compared
with IMT-RA, ELS commonly displays greater cellular
atypia and pleomorphism, and higher cellular density.
ELS generally lacks an extensive myxoid background
and inflammatory infiltrates. Furthermore, calponin and
caldesmin expression could be recognized in ELS but
not in IMT-RA [20]. (2) Inflammatory malignant fibrous
histiocytoma (IMFH): Clinically, IMFH is more prone to
occur in elderly individuals, which is different from
IMT-RA that typically develops in young adults (median
age, 34 years). Histologically, while the inflammatory infiltrates may be striking in both types of the tumors, the
neoplastic cells in IMFH tend to be more pleomorphic,
in contrast with the relative homogeneity in cellular
morphology of IMT-RA. The neoplastic cells in IMFH
are frequently fusiform and closely packed, and commonly arranged in a storiform pattern. Immunostaining
of CD68 favors the diagnosis of IMFH. (3) Epithelioid
malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (E-MPNST):
Most E-MPNSTs develop from the setting of neurofibromatosis. E-MPNST presents with more or fewer
spindled tumor cells in the lesion, and the myxoid
stroma is more often focal rather than abundant [21,22].
Moreover, desmin and CD30 expression have not been
discovered in E-MPNSTs. All of these features differ
from those of IMT-RA. (4) Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL): The distinction between IMT-RA and
ALCL has been described in a previous report [10].
Desmin and nuclear membrane ALK staining are suggestive of IMT-RA, as neither of these staining patterns
has been observed in ALCL.
Most of the reported IMT-RAs are treated by surgical
resection combined with chemotherapy. However, this
therapeutic regimen seems to not effectively control the
rapid recurrence of IMT-RAs. Recently, ALK inhibitor
(ALKi) has been applied in the therapy of 2 IMT-RA
cases, and a sustained partial response has been observed in at least 1 case [9]. Of note, the sensitivity of
ALKi was reduced during standing treatment because of
a secondary ALK gene mutation [15]. Thus, the longterm results of ALKi therapy remain to be further
evaluated.
Conclusions
In comparison with conventional IMTs, IMT-RAs show
enhanced aggressive behaviors, which are possibly
closely associated with their abdominopelvic origination,
large tumor size, epithelioid tumoral morphology, and
RANPB2-ALK gene rearrangement. An in-depth understanding on this entity is urgently needed to avoid misdiagnosis and provide effective treatment schedules.
