Abstract
Background Liver regeneration that occurs after portal
vein embolization (PVE) may have adverse effects on the
microscopic tumor foci in the residual liver mass in
patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Methods Fifty-four HCC patients with inadequate functional residual liver volume were offered PVE during a
seven-year period. Among them, 34 (63%) patients
underwent curative resection. They were compared with a
matched control group (n = 102) who underwent surgery
without PVE. Postoperative complications, pattern of
recurrence, and survival were compared between groups.
Results In the PVE group, a pre-embolization functional
residual liver volume of 23% (12–33.5%) improved to 34%
(20–54%) (p = 0.005) at the time of surgery. When the
two groups were compared, minor (PVE, 24%; control,
29%; p = 0.651) and major (PVE, 18%; control, 15%;
p = 0.784) complications were similar. After a follow-up
period of 35 months (standard deviation 25 months),
extrahepatic recurrences were detected in 10 PVE patients
(29%) and 41 control patients (40%) (p = 0.310). Intrahepatic recurrences were seen in 10 (29%) and 47 (46%)
cases (p = 0.109) in the PVE and control groups,
respectively. In the PVE group, 41% (n = 14) of the
recurrences were detected before one year, compared with
42% (n = 43) in the control group (p = 1). Disease-free
survival rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 57, 29, and 26% in
the control group and 60, 42, and 42% in the PVE group
(log-rank, p = 0.335). On multivariate analysis, PVE was
not a factor affecting survival (p = 0.821).
Conclusions Portal vein embolization increases the
resectability of initially unresectable HCC due to inadequate functional residual liver volume, and it has no deleterious oncological effect after major resection of HCC.
Introduction
Surgery is the treatment of choice for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [1]. Yet not all detected HCCs
are amenable to surgical resection although the resection
rate varies from center to center. A functional residual liver
volume (FRLV) in excess of 25% in a normal liver or 40%
in a diseased liver is considered necessary to avoid postoperative liver failure [2]. For patients with marginal
FRLV, portal vein embolization (PVE) increases the
resectability of tumor by a corresponding increase of the
contralateral side.
Portal vein embolization for patients with HCC raises
special considerations. The effectiveness and safety of the
procedure in the presence of background diseased liver and
progression of the primary tumor are major concerns.
Furthermore, PVE and subsequent resection may promote
microscopic tumor foci. Some consider that the same
growth factors are accountable for hepatic regeneration
following PVE, but others contradict this possibility and
suggest that different mechanisms may be involved [3, 4].

Wakabayashi [5], for instance, has reported an increase in
extrahepatic tumor recurrence following PVE, while
Tanaka et al. [6] has documented increased overall survival
in a group of 33 patients. The present study evaluated the
short-term and long-term outcomes of resection of HCC in
patients who had preoperative PVE against a matched
control group of patients who did not have preoperative
PVE.
Patients and methods
The study included 54 consecutive HCC patients with
inadequate FRLV who had undergone PVE during the
period 2002–2009. Eleven (20%) of them underwent percutaneous PVE, whereas the others (80%) were treated
with an open procedure via the ileocolic vein. The patients
were reassessed after an interval of 4–6 weeks in terms of
liver function, tumor progression, and improvement in liver
volume. Resection was considered feasible for patients
with FRLV more than 20% of a normal liver, 30% of a
fibrotic liver, and 40% of a cirrhotic liver. Patients with
liver function test results comparable to pre-embolization
results and those who had no evidence of disease progression also proceeded to surgery. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) was performed after an interval of
two weeks in cases of larger tumors or when additional
time was considered necessary for liver regeneration.
Resection was considered not to be feasible for 20
patients. They were offered other forms of therapy on an
individual basis. These included radiofrequency ablation,
high-intensity focused ultrasound ablation, and repeated
cycles of TACE. One patient underwent liver transplantation outside our center. The median overall survival in this
group was 10 months (range: 8–11 months). Overall, 34
(63%) patients who had improved FRLV underwent surgery after a median interval of 45 days (range: 26–
96 days).
Thirty-four patients (the PVE group) who had undergone resection were compared with a matched control
sample. The controls were selected by screening a database
of patients who underwent surgery as the first treatment.
For each case in the PVE group, three controls were
selected, matching the year of surgery, type of resection [7]
(grouped according to Brisbane 2000 terminology of liver
anatomy and resections), and the presence of vascular
permeation.
Postoperative complications in the two groups were
categorized according to the Clavien grading [8] for further
analysis, with grades 1 and 2 complications being considered minor and grades 3 and 4 considered major.
All patients were regularly followed up at the outpatient
clinic and were prospectively monitored for recurrence.
The standard protocol of surveillance included contrastenhanced computed tomography (CT) scan at one month
after resection, followed by liver function test, serum
alpha-fetoprotein level check, ultrasonography or CT scan,
and chest radiograph every three months. Suspected
intrahepatic recurrence was confirmed by hepatic angiography, post-lipiodol CT scan and, if necessary, percutaneous needle biopsy.
The two groups were compared in terms of their baseline clinicopathological features (Table 1). On univariate
analysis, there was a significant difference in the preoperative platelet count (p = 0.030), international normalized
ratio (p = 0.035), and resection margin (p = 0.023) between the two groups. Furthermore, 16 patients in the PVE
group underwent concurrent TACE, but none of the
patients in the control group were subjected to this procedure (p\0.001). There was no significant difference in
other factors, including maximum tumor size, number of
tumor nodules, presence of microsatellite nodules, differentiation, and American Joint Cancer Committee (AJCC)
tumor stage. The PVE group had a higher percentage of
patients with background cirrhosis, and the control group
had a higher percentage of patients with a normal liver. As
outcome measures, postoperative complications, diseasefree survival, and pattern of tumor recurrence were compared between the two groups.
Statistics
Statistical comparison between groups was performed
using the chi-squared test with the Yates correction (or
Fisher’s exact test where appropriate) for nominal data and
the Mann-Whitney U-test for numerical data. Disease-free
survival rates were computed according to the KaplanMeier method and compared with the log-rank test. The
Cox proportional hazard model was used for multivariate
analysis. All analyses were performed with the statistical
software SPSS (version 12; SPSS, Chicago, IL). A value of
p\0.050 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Role of PVE and surgery
In both the resected and non-resected groups of patients, a
significant increase of FRLV was noted after PVE. In the
non-resected group, the median pre-embolization FRLV
was 25% (16–37%) and 29% (18–46%) (p = 0.023) after
PVE. In the resected group, the pre-embolization FRLV
was 23% (12–33.5%), and improved to 34% (20–54%)
(p = 0.005) after PVE. One patient developed pleural

effusion after PVE, which resolved spontaneously. There
were no other complications reported after PVE.
Resection was not feasible in 20 (37%) patients. In 10
(18.5%) patients, increase of the FRLV was considered
inadequate. In 4 of them, the decision against resection was
taken during surgery despite apparently adequate FRLV on
the preoperative radiological assessment. In the other 10
patients, surgery was considered not to be feasible due to
(1) deteriorated liver function test results in three (5.5%),
(2) development of extrahepatic metastasis in three (5.5%),
(3) macroscopically grossly cirrhotic liver or extensive
varices in two (3.7%), (4) progression of the primary tumor
in one (2%), and (5) tumor rupture in one (Fig. 1). Thirtyfour (63%) patients underwent curative resection. There
were two (3.7%) hospital deaths; one patient died from
liver failure and the other developed sepsis and subsequent
liver failure. Overall, with the combination of PVE and
surgery, 32/54 (60%) of the patients were able to achieve
long-term survival (Fig. 1).
Comparison of the PVE and control groups
Postoperative complications are shown in Table 2. There
were two deaths in each group. Minor complications
occurred in 10/34 (29%) of PVE patients and 25/102 (24%)
of control patients (p = 0.651). Major complications were
seen in 6/34 (17.6%) of PVE patients and 15/102 (14.7%)
of controls (p = 0.784).
The mean follow-up period in the two groups was
35 months (standard deviation, 25 months). Overall, 14
(41%) patients in the PVE group developed recurrence,
compared to 54 (53%) in the control group (p = 0.322).

Extrahepatic recurrence was detected in 10 (29%) and 41
(40%) cases in the PVE group and the control group,
respectively (p = 0.310). Intrahepatic recurrence was
detected in 10 (29%) of the PVE patients and 47 (46%) of
the control patients (p = 0.109). There was no difference
in the timing of detection of recurrence. Fourteen (41%) of
the recurrence cases in the PVE group and 43 (42%) in the
control group were detected before one year (p = 1.000).
The median disease-free survival in the PVE group was
14 months (range: 1.9–94 months), and that in the control
group was 13 months (range: 1–88 months). Figure 2
shows the disease-free survival and overall survival of the
two groups. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year disease-free survival
rates were 57, 29, and 26% respectively, in the control
group and 60, 42, and 42%, respectively, in the PVE group
(log-rank, p = 0.335).
On multivariate Cox regression analysis, venous infiltration (p = 0.004; HR = 1.9; 95% CI = 1.2–3), largest
tumor diameter (p = 0.006; HR = 1.07; 95% CI = 1.02–
1.12), and tumor stage (p = 0.006; HR = 1.33; 95%
CI = 1.08–1.65) were the only individual factors associated with disease-free survival. Portal vein embolization
was not a factor affecting disease-free survival (p = 0.821;
HR = 1.056; 95% CI = 0.65–1.7).
Discussion
All 54 patients who underwent PVE were not resectable
initially due to inadequate FRLV. The combination of PVE
and surgery was effective in 60% of these patients. Portal
vein embolization was not associated with increased morbidity. Comparison of the PVE group with the controls
revealed that the rates of postoperative complications, as
well as the pattern of recurrence, were similar between the
two groups. There was no difference in disease-free survival between the PVE group and the controls.
Because of concerns for safety and efficacy, PVE was
initially limited to normal livers. In a prospective trial,
Farges et al. [9] compared the operative outcomes between
patients who underwent routine PVE before right hepatectomy and patients who were operated without PVE.
Their study showed a clear benefit of PVE in reducing
postoperative complications and kinetics of liver function
in patients having background chronic liver diseases. No
benefit was seen with normal livers. The group advocated
routine use of PVE in these patients and further recommended liver regeneration after PVE as a marker of postoperative outcomes. Portal vein embolization has been
used for cirrhotic livers with HCC in a number of other
centers [10–12], although most of the reported data relate
to small numbers of patients. In the present study, a higher
proportion of patients in the PVE group had cirrhosis and
worsened liver function, and they were expected to have
poorer postoperative outcomes. However, the PVE group
in fact showed statistically insignificant survival benefit. In
this context, our result seems to coincide with that found by
Tanaka et al. [6], who reported significantly superior survival in patients with cirrhosis.
Overall, 18.5% of our patients failed to gain adequate
increase of FRLV. Twenty-four patients who underwent
resection after PVE had cirrhosis. For four other cirrhotic
patients who had adequate increase of FRLV, surgery was
not performed because of other contraindications. This
indicates that 29/44 (66%) of the cirrhotic patients were
able to achieve adequate increase of FRLV after PVE.
Surgery is known to have the best results in patients with
HCC [1]. The outlook for patients with unresectable HCC
is bleak; their median survival is reported to be around

three months, and their 1-year survival could be as low as
8% [13, 14]. In our series, only one patient developed PVErelated minor complication. Patients in the PVE group
tolerated major resection well, and postoperative adverse
events were similar in the two groups. As a significant
proportion of patients in the PVE group had cirrhosis and
poor liver function, these results are even more significant.
Similar results have been published in the past by Tanaka
et al. [6] and Farges et al. [9] in particular, and both groups
recommended routine administration of PVE in patients
with injured livers. In view of these reports and our results,
PVE should be considered an effective procedure for cirrhotic patients who have stable liver function but are
denied resection because of limited FRLV. Routine
administration of preoperative PVE in all cirrhotic patients
appears to be effective but is beyond the results of the
present study.
The risk of progression of primary tumor is a matter of
debate. Hepatocellular carcinoma derives its blood supply
predominantly from the hepatic artery, and embolization of
the portal vein is known to alter the hepatic haemodynamics significantly. Kito et al. [15], using Doppler analysis, demonstrated a significant increase in the arterial flow
of the embolized side of the liver without a significant
alteration in the contralateral flow. Apart from altered
haemodynamics, induction of growth factors that could
influence tumor growth has been demonstrated following
PVE [16, 17]. Effects of these factors on primary tumor
remain the subject of debate.
Most clinical data on tumor kinetics are based on
colorectal liver metastasis [18]. These show increased
tumor growth during the interval period. In our series, only
one patient was found to have primary tumor progression
limiting curative resection, whereas three others developed
extrahepatic metastasis. In other reported studies on HCC,
inoperability due to tumor progression was less than 10%
[11, 19]. With these findings taken into account, tumor
progression seems a minor clinical problem.
Concurrent use of TACE has been advocated by many
authors to control primary tumor and induce liver hypertrophy [20, 21]. The efficacy of this approach remains
questionable [22]. We were selective in using TACE in our
study group. Almost half (47%) of our patients who had
tumors likely to progress or who had a marginal liver
volume were offered a combined treatment of PVE and
TACE. Only one patient (1/42, 2%) had local tumor progression. Because of the small number of patients in our
series, a subgroup analysis of our patients was not performed. However, a recent study from a Korean group
compared the outcomes of 71 patients who underwent such
combined treatment with the outcomes of 64 patients who
had PVE alone [23]. The former group of patients were
found to have a more favorable postoperative liver function. They also had better overall survival and disease-free

survival. In a smaller but well-planned study on the combined use of PVE and TACE, in addition to better clinical
outcomes and survival, pathological specimens showed
complete tumor necrosis in 15 of 18 patients [24]. In the
present study, the combination of PVE with TACE could
have contributed to the comparable outcomes in the PVE
group despite the significant proportion of cirrhotic
patients. Further TACE was offered to patients who had
worse tumors that were likely to become unresectable.
Routine administration of PVE combined with TACE
might have had a beneficial effect, although this cannot be
concluded from this study.
When tumor recurrence was evaluated, we failed to
demonstrate any significant difference in disease-free survival or the pattern of recurrence between the PVE and
control groups. Further on multivariate analysis, only
venous infiltration, tumour stage, and tumor size were
shown to be associated with recurrence. To date there are at
least three published series focusing on long-term recurrence of HCC after PVE. Tanaka et al. [6] evaluated 30
patients with and without PVE before surgery and showed
a better overall survival in patients who had undergone
PVE. However, the overall recurrence rate was not statistically different between the two groups. Palavecino et al.
[25] reported disease-free survival of 84, 56, and 56% after
PVE at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively, compared to 66, 49,
and 49% without PVE. Azoulay et al. [26] reported disease-free survival of 86, 64, and 21% with PVE versus 55,
17, and 17% without PVE at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively.
The effect of hepatic regeneration on micrometastasis
has been studied extensively. De Jong et al. [4] and
Mizutani et al. [27] have shown enhanced proliferation of
malignant cells in remnant livers after hepatic resection.
Some consider that the same growth factors are accountable for hepatic regeneration following PVE, but others
contradict this possibility and suggest that a different
mechanism may be involved [28, 29]. Vascular permeation
is a well-recognized tumor characteristic predicting recurrence. Based on this finding, potential benefits of portal
vein obliteration ahead of surgery have been discussed by
some authors [30, 31]. Transforming growth factor beta is a
polypeptide that suppresses hepatocyte growth and tumor
proliferation [32]. Its increased expression has been shown
following PVE [33].
It is likely that multiple factors affecting tumor proliferation negatively or positively are brought on by PVE.
However, all clinical data indicate that the overall effect of
PVE on future recurrence is clinically insignificant. The
apparently marginally better recurrence-free survival
noticed in clinical studies could possibly be due to the
selection of patients during PVE.
In summary, the combination of PVE and surgery was
effective in 60% of the patients with initially unresectable
HCC. Two thirds of the cirrhotic patients were able to
achieve a substantial increase in FRLV. After resection, the
patients had rates of morbidity and recurrence-free survival
comparable to those of patients who had undergone surgery
without PVE. Thus, under the goal of increasing resectability, cirrhosis should not be a limiting factor against
PVE for patients with stable liver function.
