Abstract
The Fontan procedures, designed to treat paediatric patients with functional single ventricles, have markedly improved the
patient’s survival into adulthood. The physiology of the Fontan circuit inevitably increases systemic venous pressure, which
may lead to multi-system organ failure in the long-term follow-up. Fontan-associated liver disease (FALD) can progress to liver
cirrhosis with signs of portal hypertension. Focal nodular hyperplasia-like nodules commonly develop in FALD. Imaging
surveillance is often performed to monitor the progression of FALD and to detect hepatocellular carcinoma, which infrequently
develops in FALD. Other abdominal abnormalities in post-Fontan patients include protein losing enteropathy and pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma. Given that these abdominal abnormalities are critical for patient management, it is important for radiologists to become familiar with the abdominal abnormalities that are common in post-Fontan patients on cross-sectional imaging.

Introduction
The Fontan procedure was first introduced for patients with
tricuspid atresia to allow systemic blood return to enter the
pulmonary arteries without passage through a ventricle in
1968 by Fontan and Baudet [1, 2]. Subsequently, the procedure has been applied for most forms of functional single
ventricles [3–6]. Surgical modifications of the procedure
along with advances in postoperative management led to
prolonged patient survival, frequently into adulthood [7–9].
The Fontan circuit allows the entire systemic venous return
to enter the pulmonary vascular bed directly, bypassing the
right ventricle. There are two ways to connect the systemic
venous return to pulmonary arteries: either through the right
atrium (namely atriopulmonary circulation) or by direct connection of superior vena cava (SVC) and inferior vena cava
(IVC) to pulmonary arteries (namely cavopulmonary circulation). Cavopulmonary circulation is subdivided according to
the type of IVC connection to the pulmonary artery either by
intra-atrial lateral tunnel conduit or external cardiac conduit
[10]. Due to the absence of a pumping ventricle, the transmission of pulmonary vascular resistance to the systemic venous
circulation inevitably leads to chronically elevated systemic
venous pressure. Thus, all organ systems of the body are exposed to chronic venous congestion, potentially leading to
multi-system organ failure [11–13].

Fontan-associated liver disease (FALD) has been
recognised as the disease process of liver structure and function resulting from the Fontan circulation, excluding other
plausible causes such as viral hepatitis or alcohol toxicity.
FALD is a broad term encompassing hepatic parenchymal
change, hypervascular regenerative hepatic nodules and ultimately hepatic cirrhosis [14] . FALD is considered one of the
major non-cardiac determinants of mortality in adult Fontan
patients [15–18]. Other abdominal abnormalities found in
adult patients with Fontan circulation include signs of portal
hypertension such as ascites or varices, protein losing enteropathy (PLE) and pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma.
Although the imaging features of abdominal abnormalities
after Fontan operation have been described in several publications mostly for the paediatric population [19–22], abdominal imaging findings in adult patients with Fontan circulation
have not been well described in detail. In this review, we
summarise the cross-sectional imaging findings of the hepatic
and extrahepatic abnormalities in the abdomen in adult patients with Fontan circulation.
Fontan-associated liver disease
Among the gastrointestinal system, the liver is particularly
vulnerable to the elevated systemic venous pressure in
Fontan circulation compared to other organ systems for four
principal reasons [13, 14]. Firstly, most venous return from
the gastrointestinal system passes through the liver.
Secondly, portal venous flow to the liver relies on the pressure gradient between the hepatic and portal veins that decreases as the systemic venous pressure increases, in contrast
to other organs in which the blood flow relies on the pressure
gradient between the arterial and venous systems. Third, the
natural response of diversion of gastrointestinal blood to other organs such as brain, heart and muscles further compromises already precarious circulation of the liver. Lastly, lymphatic drainage disturbance due to increased central venous
pressure causes lymphatic-mediated hepatic congestion and
sinusoidal dilatation, which in turn attributes to the liver
injury [23].
Adult patients with Fontan circulation are prone to developing FALD as they age. It frequently results in chronic hepatic congestion, liver cirrhosis, portal hypertension, focal
nodular hyperplasia (FNH)-like nodules and even hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [15, 24–26]. The possible mechanisms
of hepatic dysfunction in FALD include chronic passive venous congestion, reversed blood flow with deep intrahepatic
reflux during atrial contraction [11], and reduced hepatic
blood supply with subsequent hypoxic damage from relatively
low cardiac output after Fontan operation [27, 28].
Histopathological changes begin with sinusoidal dilatation,
parenchymal atrophy and progressive sinusoidal fibrosis in
the perivenular distribution, similar to that of right heart failure, but more exaggerated over time in patients with Fontan
circulation [11].
The severity of FALD is positively related to the duration
of the Fontan circulation, elevated hepatic venous pressure,
failing Fontan circulation and increased serological markers
such as hyaluronic acid or gamma-glutamyltransferase [11,
29, 30]. Monitoring FALD with imaging surveillance is essential in guiding patient management such as medical therapy
for liver cirrhosis, placement on the liver transplantation list or
treating HCC when it is detected. In post-Fontan patients who
are considered for heart transplantation, severe FALD is considered a contraindication for heart transplantation or combined heart-liver transplantation [16, 26, 31].
Given the clinical importance of FALD in adult patients
with Fontan circulation, various non-invasive screening/
surveillance protocols for FALD have been suggested regarding the timing, intervals, and modalities [16, 18, 26, 32, 33].
Liver biopsy still remains the “gold standard” for assessing the
severity of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. However, reported liver
changes secondary to FALD are not uniformly distributed and
therefore liver biopsy may overestimate or underestimate the
presence or nature of FALD [19, 28, 34]. Further, the risk of
biopsy-related bleeding complication is likely to be higher due
to the frequent use of warfarin and elevated systemic venous
pressures [32, 35]. Therefore, non-invasive imaging surveillance may play a major role for the surveillance of FALD and
its related changes.
Imaging of hepatic parenchymal changes
The liver may appear normal or slightly hypoechoic on ultrasound (US) at the early stage of congestive hepatopathy. As
the fibrosis develops, coarse heterogeneous hyperechoic parenchymal pattern and surface nodularity are visualised [30]
(Fig. 1a). The liver is often enlarged with caudate lobe hypertrophy similar to Budd-Chiari syndrome. Correlations
have been reported between the severity of US features and
the degree of hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis [20, 36, 37].
Irregular parenchymal fatty infiltration with perivascular distribution can be seen in US and in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with in-phase and out-of-phase sequences
(Fig. 1b-d) [22, 38]. On MRI, heterogeneous hyperintensity
on T2-weighted images and hypointensity on T1-weighted
images in the periphery of the liver, which is commonly seen
in acute or subacute Budd-Chiari syndrome, is not seen in
FALD [39–41], probably due to chronic gradual congestive
changes of the liver over a long period. Diffusion-weighted
imaging (DWI) can help estimating the degree of hepatic
fibrosis. Wolff et al. [21] reported that low apparent diffusion
coefficient values in DWI may reflect progressive liver damage due to chronic congestion and potential hypoperfusion in
post-Fontan patients.
358 Insights Imaging (2018) 9:357–367

In addition to the morphological changes of the liver,
markedly heterogeneous hepatic enhancement with mosaic
or reticular patterns, resulting from relatively slow and poor
enhancement near the congested hepatic veins, is the most
common imaging feature in FALD [19, 38]. Contrastenhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in our anecdotal experience
shows heterogeneous and decreased enhancement of the liver
in the portal venous phase similar to cirrhotic liver of other
common aetiologies (Fig. 1e). The abnormal enhancement is
more prominent in the periphery of the liver than the central
portion and is most evident in the portal venous phase
(Fig. 2a-d). The hypertrophic caudate lobe often shows more
homogeneous enhancement compared to the rest of the liver
[13] (Fig. 2b). Hepatobiliary phase MRI using a hepatocytespecific contrast agent (gadoxetate disodium; Primovist;
Bayer, Berlin, Germany) often shows heterogeneous
hypoenhancement in the hepatobiliary phase, which reflects
decreased hepatic function [42] (Fig. 2e). Hepatic fibrosis
may be seen as reticular hyperenhancement in the delayed
phase of CT or MRI. It has been reported that the degree of
hepatic dysfunction is not well correlated with the degree of
fibrosis in post-Fontan patients [18, 43]. Therefore, follow-up
with clinical and laboratory tests is also essential.
Imaging of hepatic nodules
Large regenerative hepatic nodules are commonly seen in
adult patients with FALD. The pathophysiology of the development of the nodules is not fully elucidated, although it has
been hypothesised that central venous hypertension transmitted directly to the hepatic peri-venular areas diminishes portal
blood flow and promotes arterialisation [44–46]. The prevalence of the nodules in adult patients with Fontan circulation
ranges from 20 to 30% [11, 44, 46]. The nodules have been
named both large regenerative nodules and focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH)-like nodules in the literature and can be
found in patients with other causes of hepatic venous outflow
obstruction such as Budd-Chiari syndrome or right heart failure [38, 47–49]. The nomenclature of “FNH-like nodule”
comes from imaging features [38, 46, 50] of hyperenhancement in the arterial phase and iso-enhancement in
the delayed phase (Fig. 3a-c) and from histopathological

features [44] of small islands of hepatic parenchyma separated
by bands of arterialised vascular fibrous septa with a pseudocapsule, similar to FNH.
Unfortunately, HCC can develop in adult patients with
FALD [25, 26, 32, 46, 51] (Fig. 4) although the incidence of
HCC is much lower than that of FNH-like nodules. Routine
surveillance in FALD for HCC has been suggested, but there
has been no consensus regarding the frequency of surveillance, the type of imaging modalities and the time interval
after Fontan procedure. Progression from a dysplastic nodule
to HCC is a potential stepwise pathway in liver cirrhosis
imposed by Fontan circulation. However, malignant potential
of FNH-like nodules is uncertain and has been controversial
[18, 24, 44, 46]. Alleged benign large regenerative nodules in
the chronic congested liver often mimic HCC radiologically
and may render a correct diagnosis difficult [38]. Interval increase in size, washout in the portal venous phase, mosaic
architecture, and elevated alpha-fetoprotein may be associated
with HCC [22, 38].
FNH-like nodules in FALD are often small and multiple,
and show a predilection for the right lobe in the periphery
(mostly within 2 cm of the liver surface) [20]. On CEUS,

FNH-like nodules in FALD show enhancement features similar to FNH; hyper-enhancement in the arterial phase, centrifugal enhancement, central stellate vasculature and sustained
enhancement without washout (Supplementary material 1).
MRI using liver-specific contrast agent is useful for
characterising FNH-like nodules by demonstrating iso- or
hyper-enhancement in the hepatobiliary phase. The FNHlike nodules may show central hypointensity in the
hepatobiliary phase representing a central scar (Fig. 3c).
HCC typically shows [25, 32, 51–57] arterial-phase hyperenhancement followed by late and mild washout on dynamic
contrast-enhanced imaging. CEUS is potentially useful for
indeterminate hepatic nodules in FALD on CT or MRI, especially for the patients who are contraindicated for contrastenhanced CT or MRI. Suspicion of HCC is raised upon large
size, interval change in size or echogenicity, mass-like appearance or nodules causing contour abnormality on the liver
surface (Fig. 4a). However, it is important to note that the
FNH-like nodules can infrequently demonstrate washout in
the delayed phase, mimicking HCC [58, 59] (Supplementary
material 1). The reported incidence of delayed-phase washout
in FNH-like nodules is approximately 10%, in the setting of
cardiac cirrhosis secondary to constrictive pericarditis and
alcoholic cirrhosis. The pathophysiology for washout of
FNH-like nodules is not clear. Wells et al. [22] speculated
that the washout may not be related to an abnormality of
the nodule itself, but a reflection of the background parenchymal contrast retention due to parenchymal congestion and
fibrosis.
MRI using liver-specific contrast agent may be useful for
the differentiation between FNH-like nodules and HCC, as
HCC mostly show hypointensity in the hepatobiliary phase.
DWI may be also useful in differentiating between HCC and
FNH-like nodules. In our experience of a single case of HCC
in FALD, HCC showed strong restricted diffusion, whereas
FNH-like nodules did not show diffusion restriction, compatible with the study by Wells et al. [22] (Figs. 3d and 4d). The
authors suggested other ancillary findings favouring benign
FNH-like nodules, including hypointensity on T2-weighted
images.
Imaging of vascular abnormalities
On Doppler US, normal hepatic vein shows a triphasic waveform, consisting of a hepatopetal (coming towards the liver)
phase occurring during atrial systole and two hepatofugal
phases related to atrial and ventricular diastole. Loss of the
hepatopetal phase is typically considered to represent increased stiffness of the liver such as in hepatic fibrosis,
steatohepatitis and cirrhosis [60–62].
Fontan operation inevitably alters hepatic venous waveform on Doppler US. The pattern of hepatopetal phase in
hepatic vein differs between patients with total cavopulmonary
anastomosis (including both lateral tunnels and extracardiac
conduits) and with atriopulmonary connection [63–66]
(Fig. 5a–e). Hepatopetal phase is preserved in atriopulmonary
connection, which reflects the exclusion of atrial contribution
to the venous circulation, whereas flow reversal is only
visualised during early expiration in total cavopulmonary
anastomosis. Also, similar to congestive heart failure, hepatic
veins and IVC are dilated with abnormally increased
pulsatility of the hepatic vein regardless of the anastomosis
technique [38, 61, 67].
Portal venous waveform on Doppler US normally shows
slightly phasic hepatopetal flow with mildly decreased flow
during inspiration due to transient compression of the compliant liver parenchyma and easily collapsible portal venules and hepatic sinusoids [61, 68]. In patients with
Fontan circulation, the portal veins invariably show
hepatopetal flow with variable phasicity, but the flow velocity is lower than in the normal population [69, 70]. While
the dilatation of the IVC and hepatic veins is frequently
seen in post-Fontan patients, the diameter of the main portal
vein and intrahepatic portal veins is usually small, possibly
due to reduction of portal perfusion secondary to increased
sinusoidal pressure with venous stasis [39] (Fig. 5). Bland
portal vein thrombosis seems to be rare in post-Fontan patients with no reported cases compared to Budd-Chiari syndrome, where portal vein thrombosis occurs up to 18% [71,
72]. Hepatofugal flow of the portal vein, which can be
found in severe portal hypertension or Budd-Chiari syndrome with large extrahepatic portosystemic collaterals,
has not been reported in post-Fontan patients [63, 66, 70,
73–75] . It can be explained by relatively high systemic
venous pressure in Fontan circulation, preventing the development of large extrahepatic portosystemic collaterals.
On the arterial-phase CTwith contrast injection through the
upper extremity veins, dense opacification in the dependent
portion of the IVC and hepatic veins is occasionally seen in
post-Fontan patients. This is likely due to passive retrograde
flow of the contrast material which is heavier than blood in the
absence of effective right heart function (Supplementary
material 2). This phenomenon might be different from the
opacification of IVC and all hepatic veins in patients with
right heart failure [38, 76, 77], which is the result of reflux
of contrast media into the inferior vena cava during right atrial
contraction or tricuspid regurgitation.
Extrahepatic findings
Signs of portal hypertension
Extrahepatic complications of portal hypertension secondary
to liver cirrhosis such as splenomegaly and ascites are commonly seen in adult Fontan patients. Compared to liver
362 Insights Imaging (2018) 9:357–367

cirrhosis secondary to hepatitis, extrahepatic portosystemic
shunts are uncommon or small in size in FALD, even in a
decompensated state, likely due to the high systemic venous
pressure in Fontan circulation and relatively low pressure gradient between the portal and systemic veins to promote the
formation of large portosystemic collaterals [38]
(Supplementary material 3).
Protein losing enteropathy
Protein losing enteropathy (PLE) is characterised by enteric loss
of proteins including albumin, immunoglobulins and clotting
factors. Patients with PLE present with peripheral oedema, ascites, diarrhoea, weight loss and malabsorption. The reported
incidence of PLE in Fontan patients ranges from 3 to 18%, with
a reported mortality of 50% within 5 years after initial diagnosis
[78–80]. Elevated systemic venous pressure and mesenteric
vasoconstriction, which is the natural reaction to decreased cardiac output, might be the cause of PLE. Additionally, lymphatic
dilatation, stasis and leakage, and inflammatory reaction secondary to elevated systemic venous pressure, further contribute
to the development of PLE [19, 80, 81].
Early clinical diagnosis of PLE is often difficult because the
patients may have a long asymptomatic period [80–82]. As multiple intensive therapeutic approaches enable an improved survival rate of up to 88% at 5 years [83], early recognition of excessive
enteric loss of protein is important. Suggestive imaging findings
including ascites, diffuse bowel wall thickening, and severe mesenteric oedema along the root of the mesentery on CT or MRI,
should prompt a clinical evaluation to rule out PLE [13].

Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma
Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma are neuroendocrine tumours arising from neural crest-derived cells or
organs in the adrenal gland and along the central sympathetic and parasympathetic chains, respectively. There have
been several anecdotal reports of the development of
pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma in patients with congenital cyanotic heart disease after corrective or palliative
cardiac surgery, including the Fontan procedure [84–90].
Suggested pathophysiology is a stimulation of catecholamine overproduction and chronic endocrine hyperactivity
resulting from the hypoxic state of congenital heart disease
[91]. The tumours may cause palpitations, progressive arrhythmia, fatigue and malaise. Pheochromocytoma or
paraganglioma are typically seen as heterogeneously and
avidly hyper-enhancing masses with areas of necrosis and
cystic component [92, 93] (Fig. 6).

Conclusions
Fontan procedures, designed to treat patients with functional
single ventricles, have markedly improved the patient’s survival into adulthood. The physiology of the Fontan circuit
inevitably increases systemic venous pressure, which may
lead to multi-system organ failure in the long-term followup. FALD is most common among post-Fontan abdominal
complications and can progress to liver cirrhosis with signs
of portal hypertension. FNH-like nodules frequently develop
in FALD as small multiple nodules with arterial-phase hyperenhancement and show imaging findings similar to FNH.
Imaging surveillance is often performed to monitor the progression of FALD to liver cirrhosis and to detect HCC, which
infrequently develops in FALD. Extrahepatic abdominal abnormalities in post-Fontan patients include signs of portal hypertension such as ascites, splenomegaly and varices, protein
losing enteropathy, and pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma.
Given that these abdominal abnormalities are critical for patient management, it is important to be familiar with the typical imaging findings of the abnormalities on cross-sectional
imaging.
