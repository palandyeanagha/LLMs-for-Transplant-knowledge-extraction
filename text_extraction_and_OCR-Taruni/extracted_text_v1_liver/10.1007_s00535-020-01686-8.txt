Introduction
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects at least
25% of the global adult population [1, 2], and has become
one of the leading causes of cirrhosis and hepatocellular
carcinoma in Western countries [3, 4]. Although NAFLD
appears to be milder in Asia [5], the rise in liver decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma and death due to
NAFLD is particularly steep in China [6]. NAFLD is
divided into nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL, also known as
simple steatosis) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)
according to disease severity [7]. The latter is characterized
by the presence of lobular inflammation and hepatocyte
ballooning. While NAFL can progress to NASH and vice
versa [8], on the whole, NASH patients are at a higher risk
of fibrosis progression and liver-related complications
[9, 10]. Accumulating fibrosis eventually results in cirrhosis and subsequent complications. Because fibrosis is
the path towards cirrhosis, it comes as no surprise that
fibrosis has the strongest correlation with liver-related
morbidity and mortality in longitudinal studies [11].
In the past, liver biopsy was the primary investigation to
determine the severity of NAFLD. It also serves to exclude
other liver diseases. However, it is an invasive procedure
with a 0.3% risk of bleeding. Patient acceptability is low,

and it is undesirable to perform liver biopsy repeatedly to
assess disease progression and treatment response. More
importantly, liver biopsy is not a real gold standard for the
evaluation of the histological features of NAFLD. Because
a liver biopsy sample only represents around 1/50,000 of
the entire liver volume, there is considerable sampling
variability [12]. The interpretation of individual histological features of NAFLD also suffers from intraobserver and
interobserver variability [13]. Among the key histological
features of NAFLD, the reproducibility and interobserver
concordance are particularly poor for lobular inflammation
and hepatocyte ballooning, which are both defining features of NASH. There has therefore been much interest in
the development of non-invasive tests to replace or supplement liver biopsy in the past 2 decades.
Non-invasive tests of NAFLD can be classified by the
target disease state or the type of test. Disease states of
interest include the detection of hepatic steatosis (for the
diagnosis of NAFLD or using steatosis improvement as
treatment outcomes in early phase studies), NASH, and
fibrosis. Types of tests include simple scores based on
routine clinical and laboratory parameters, specific blood
biomarkers, and imaging techniques. There have already
been numerous reviews on non-invasive tests [14, 15]. This
review focuses instead on confounding factors that affect
the performance and accuracy of non-invasive tests in
NAFLD. In addition, because biomarkers for NASH are
less well developed and few studies have examined the
confounding factors of such biomarkers, this article
restricts the discussion to non-invasive tests of hepatic
steatosis and fibrosis. As far as possible, we discuss confounding factors identified in original studies. For non-invasive tests without a clear analysis of confounding factors,
we also discuss potential confounding factors based on the
components or mechanisms of those tests.
Non-invasive tests of hepatic steatosis
Hepatic steatosis is the defining feature of NAFLD. Current
guidelines define NAFLD as the presence of C 5% hepatic
steatosis by histology in the absence of excess alcohol
consumption [7, 16, 17]. The clinical significance of the
degree of hepatic steatosis is unclear. In longitudinal
studies, histological steatosis grade and controlled attenuation parameter measurement by vibration-controlled
transient elastography had no or weak association with
overall and liver-related mortality [18–20]. In contrast,
several studies suggest that an improvement in magnetic
resonance imaging proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF)
correlate with histological improvement, defined as an
improvement in the NAFLD activity score or resolution of
NASH [21–23], though others have not observed such
correlation [24, 25].
Simple scores for hepatic steatosis
Simple scores for hepatic steatosis are typically derived by
logistic regression or other statistical methods using clinical or laboratory factors that are associated with the presence of hepatic steatosis. The Fatty Liver Index, United
States Fatty Liver Index and the Study of Health in
Pomerania (SHIP) score, for example, were derived using
abdominal ultrasonography as the reference standard
[26–28]. Other scores used more accurate measurements of
hepatic steatosis as reference standards. For instance,
SteatoTest was derived using artificial intelligence against
liver histology of patients with different liver diseases as
the reference standard [29]. The NAFLD ridge score [30]
and the Dallas Steatosis Index [31] were derived using
proton-magnetic resonance spectroscopy or MRI-PDFF as
the reference standard. The latter has the advantage of
reflecting the general population or primary care setting,
where these scores would be most applicable.
Because these scores include common clinical and laboratory parameters, they can be calculated with almost no
additional costs. However, the parameters are statistical
associations and do not directly measure hepatic steatosis;
thus, they are also subject to the influence of confounding
factors (Table 1). In particular, lipids (triglycerides and/or
cholesterol in Fatty Liver Index, SteatoTest, SHIP score,
NAFLD ridge score and Dallas Steatosis Index) and glycemic parameters (glucose, hemoglobin A1c and/or insulin
in the United States Fatty Liver Index, NAFLD liver fat
score, SteatoTest, NAFLD ridge score and Dallas Steatosis
Index) are affected by drug treatments. Patients receiving
treatment for dyslipidemia and diabetes may have a dissociation between improvements in simple scores and
improvements in hepatic steatosis. The capacity of indices
to reflect longitudinal changes in intrahepatic lipid following lifestyle intervention is also diet dependent, and can
be monitored with moderate precision in low-fat diets but
not in low-carbohydrate diets [32]. A low fat diet alters
body weight, waist circumference, triacylglycerol, and
gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, and this is reflected by
changes in NAFLD-Liver Fat Score and Fatty Liver Index.
However, a low-carbohydrate diet appears to affect liver
metabolism and insulin sensitivity differently and changes
in intrahepatic fat does not result in changes in liver fat
scores. The performance of these fatty liver scores in
patients receiving metabolic treatment and lifestyle modifications should be clarified in future studies.
On the other hand, other than exceptional circumstances
(e.g. profound weight reduction after bariatric surgery),
remission of metabolic diseases is rare. A diabetic patient
732 J Gastroenterol (2020) 55:731–741
123

would continue to be considered to have diabetes mellitus
even if she manages to lose weight and reduce the dosage
of anti-diabetic drugs. The scores do not take the severity
of disease into account. As a result, scores including
metabolic diagnoses (e.g. diabetes in Hepatic Steatosis
Index, NAFLD liver fat score and Dallas Steatosis Index;
metabolic syndrome in NAFLD liver fat score; and
hypertension in the NAFLD ridge score and Dallas
Steatosis Index) may be less suitable for the detection of
improvement in hepatic steatosis over time. This
phenomenon also applies to other irreversible factors such
as age, sex and ethnicity.
Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (in the Fatty Liver
Index, United States Fatty Liver Index and SteatoTest) is
increased with alcohol consumption [33]. Although the
diagnosis of NAFLD requires exclusion of excess alcohol
consumption, the distinction between NAFLD and alcoholrelated liver disease is arbitrary and mainly for research
purposes. In real life, many patients have fatty liver due to
both metabolic factors and alcohol, and such patients often

have more severe disease and worse outcomes [34]. The
performance of these simple scores in patients with and
without alcohol consumption is thus of practical importance and should be clarified in future studies.
In addition, haptoglobin (in SteatoTest) is affected by
hemolysis. The total bilirubin (in SteatoTest) is increased
in patients with hemolysis, biliary pathology and Gilbert
syndrome. White cell count (in the NAFLD ridge score) is
affected by infection and hematological diseases. Ferritin
(in the SHIP score) is an acute phase protein and is
increased in inflammatory states.
Imaging studies
Routine imaging studies
In routine clinical setting, abdominal ultrasonography is
primarily used to diagnose fatty liver (Table 2). Although it
is inexpensive and widely available, ultrasonography is
operator dependent. It is important to report the criteria to
diagnose NAFLD and the interobserver concordance in
clinical research using ultrasonography. Alternatively,
some studies used stored ultrasound images to define
NAFLD or validate the performance of operators [35].
While ultrasonography has good accuracy to diagnose fatty
liver when hepatic steatosis exceeds 30%, it is less sensitive to mild steatosis [36]. Besides, ultrasonography does
not perform well in patients with morbid obesity because of
poor image quality. A high riding liver and focal fatty
sparing also affect the interpretation of ultrasound images.
In a study of 171 patients with various causes of hepatitis from Taiwan, age, body mass index and fibrosis stage
were independent factors associated with discordance
between ultrasonography and liver histology in the detection of hepatic steatosis [37], but the confounding effect of
age was not observed in other studies [38]. Theoretically,
aging is associated with renal decline and changes in
echotexture. Because one of the key features of fatty liver
on ultrasonography is bright liver echotexture in relation to
the kidney, aging may affect this comparison. Likewise, the
liver echotexture is affected by advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, which in turn may influence the diagnosis of fatty
liver.
The attenuation values of computed tomography have
inverse correlation with the degree of hepatic steatosis
[39, 40]. Hepatic iron overload increases liver attenuation
and may affect the determination of hepatic steatosis [41].
Because of radiation exposure, computed tomography is
not primarily used for the detection of NAFLD.
Controlled attenuation parameter
The amplitude of ultrasound waves decreases more rapidly
in a steatotic liver. This explains why deeper tissues are
less clear when one uses ultrasonography to examine a
patient with NAFLD. Controlled attenuation parameter
(CAP) by vibration-controlled transient elastography
makes use of this physical phenomenon to measure the
attenuation of ultrasound waves and thereby estimates the
severity of hepatic steatosis. Overall, CAP has moderate
accuracy in detecting fatty liver, but there is considerable
overlap of CAP values among steatosis grades [42]. Nevertheless, a recent study showed that CAP was reduced in a
dose–response fashion during acetyl Co-A carboxylase
inhibitor treatment for NAFLD [43]. Because vibrationcontrolled transient elastography is a point-of-care test, its
role as a monitoring tool during NASH treatment deserves
further evaluation.
Similar to ultrasonography, CAP is affected by obesity.
Above all, failed examinations are more common in obese
patients [44], though this problem is largely mitigated by
the development of the XL probe [45]. Studies from
Malaysia and Japan suggest that the accuracy of CAP for
the detection of hepatic steatosis was also lower in obese

patients [46, 47]. Moreover, significant liver fibrosis may
affect ultrasound attenuation and lower the diagnostic
performance of CAP [47].
Although food intake and active hepatitis are wellknown causes of false positive liver stiffness measurement,
these factors do not appear to affect CAP [48, 49]. With
that said, because CAP and liver stiffness are measured
simultaneously during vibration-controlled transient elastography examination, clinicians should still ask patients to
fast before examination and refrain from performing
vibration-controlled transient elastography in patients with
risk factors of false positive results (see below).
Studies from Europe, the United States and Asia suggest
that the interquartile range of CAP can serve as reliability
criteria of CAP. If the interquartile range exceeds
30–40 dB/m, the accuracy of CAP measurements may be
reduced [50–52]. Although another multicenter study from
the United Kingdom suggests otherwise, that study only
included patients suspected to have NAFLD and did not
have a sufficient number of controls for comparison [53].
Magnetic resonance imaging
Proton-magnetic resonance spectroscopy and MRI-PDFF
are highly reproducible and accurate and can be considered
as the gold standard to quantify hepatic steatosis. Because
the two techniques have almost identical accuracy and
MRI-PDFF examines the entire liver and does not require
additional sequences, the former is not the preferred MRIbased technique [54]. Although iron deposition may affect
the estimation of steatosis, the overall effect is mild and
can be corrected during analysis [55].
Non-invasive tests of hepatic fibrosis
Fibrosis is undoubtedly the histological feature with the
strongest correlation with liver-related morbidity and
mortality [19, 56]. Portal hypertension and cirrhotic complications only develop in patients with cirrhosis
[13, 57, 58]. Although hepatocellular carcinoma has been
well reported in non-cirrhotic patients with NAFLD [59],
cirrhosis remains one of the most important risk factors for
hepatocellular carcinoma [60, 61], and the absolute incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in the non-cirrhotic
population is very low [62]. Thus, the diagnosis of fibrosis
and cirrhosis in patients with NAFLD has major prognostic
implications and is pivotal in selecting patients for hepatocellular carcinoma and varices surveillance.
Furthermore, because of the close association between
fibrosis and clinical outcomes, regulators such as the United States Food and Drug Administration and the European
Medicines Agency recognize histological fibrosis
improvement with no worsening of NASH as one of the
key endpoints for conditional drug approval in phase 3
NASH trials [63].
Simple fibrosis scores
Similar to simple scores for hepatic steatosis described
above, fibrosis scores were derived and validated by statistical methods using factors that were independently
associated with fibrosis (Table 3). With few exceptions,
liver biopsy was the reference standard for those scores.
For historical reasons, most of the scores were initially
tested in patients with chronic hepatitis C and subsequently
validated in patients with NAFLD. Although the diagnostic
accuracy is modest, these scores are inexpensive and can
be performed easily at primary care setting. In one study
from the United Kingdom, a referral pathway based on the
use of Fibrosis-4 index followed by the Enhanced Liver
Fibrosis panel increased the identification of patients with
advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis by four-fold [64]. Although
none of these scores is good enough to rule in advanced
fibrosis, they all have respectable negative predictive values to exclude advanced fibrosis, particularly at the community level or primary care setting [65, 66]. Importantly,
several studies have confirmed their roles in excluding
future development of liver-related morbidity and mortality
[67, 68]. Therefore, it is reasonable to apply these scores in
primary care settings. Patients with low fibrosis scores can
be safely monitored.
Few studies specifically looked at reasons for inaccurate
prediction by fibrosis scores. In a multicenter European
study of 634 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD, the
aspartate aminotransferase (AST)-to-alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ratio, NAFLD fibrosis score and Fibrosis-4
index performed poorly for the diagnosis of advanced
fibrosis in those aged 35 years or below [69]. In the same
study, the specificity of the Fibrosis-4 index and NAFLD
fibrosis score decreased to unacceptable levels in patients
aged 65 years or above. This is because age is a component
of these two fibrosis scores [70, 71]. On the other hand,
Fibrosis-4 index and NAFLD activity score do not appear
to be affected by body mass index or ALT level [72, 73]. In
contrast, in our experience, AST is often higher than ALT
in normal individuals with normal ALT level (unpublished
results from our population cohort) [74]. One should
exercise caution when interpreting scores with AST/ALT
ratio as a component in patients with normal ALT.
Platelet count is a component of the AST-to-platelet
ratio index, Fibrosis-4 index and NAFLD fibrosis score
because thrombocytopenia is a feature of cirrhosis due to
hypersplenism [70, 71, 75]. However, platelets may also
decrease in immune thrombocytopenia purpura and bone
marrow diseases. On the other hand, platelets may increase
J Gastroenterol (2020) 55:731–741 735
123

in myeloproliferative disease or in response to blood loss. It
has been reported that the accuracy of non-invasive fibrosis
scores in identifying advanced fibrosis may be reduced if
the platelet count is greater than 150 9 109
/L [76]. The
NAFLD fibrosis score also includes albumin, as protein
synthesis is impaired in patients with advanced liver disease [71]. However, hypoalbuminemia may also develop in
other conditions, such as in patients with chronic illnesses,
malnutrition, nephrotic syndrome or protein-losing
enteropathy.
In addition, the diagnostic accuracy of the non-invasive
tests may be altered depending on the ethnicity. It is well
known that the severity of NAFLD differs between ethnic
groups. South Asians develop more metabolic complications at lower body mass indices, compared to Western
populations. A study showed that the accuracy of the

NAFLD fibrosis score, AST-to-platelet ratio index (APRI),
FIB-4, AST/ALT ratio and BARD score is lower in the
South Asian population compared to the Caucasian population [76]. Furthermore, the NAFLD fibrosis score has a
lower sensitivity in patients of South Asian descent, since
most of them had a lower BMI and were younger than
Caucasian patients with a similar disease stage, and thus
had a lower score (as BMI and age are components of the
score). In contrast, another multicenter study of Southeast
Asian (Malaysian and Chinese) and Caucasians showed
that ethnicity did not affect the performance of the noninvasive tests performed [73].
Furthermore, studies from Japan and Hong Kong suggest that the BARD score is less accurate than what was
reported initially in a Caucasian cohort [65, 77]. Although
the reason for this is unclear, one possible explanation is
that BARD score includes BMI, and Asian patients have
different fat distribution at the same BMI.
Although FibroMeter NAFLD is calculated using a
proprietary formula, the components are simple clinical
and laboratory parameters: age, body weight, platelets,
AST, ALT, ferritin and fasting plasma glucose [78]. Ferritin is an acute phase protein that is increased in systemic
inflammation or infection, and glucose may be affected by
anti-diabetic treatment.
Specific fibrosis biomarkers
While the simple fibrosis scores are inexpensive, the
components are not direct measurement of fibrogenesis or
fibrinolysis and are therefore subject to various confounding effects. In contrast, there are also commercially available specific fibrosis biomarkers for the assessment of
hepatic fibrosis in different liver diseases.
The Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) panel, consisting of
procollagen III amino-terminal peptide (PIIINP), hyaluronic acid and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1
(TIMP1), has been validated in cross-sectional studies
against liver biopsy and used alongside with liver biopsy in
a number of phase 2 and 3 NASH trials [79]. In healthy
people, the ELF score is higher in men and older subjects
[80]. Besides, type III collagen is found in not only the
liver but also many other organs together with type I collagen. Elevation of PIIINP level has been reported in bone
fracture [81] and other fibrotic diseases such as burns [82],
interstitial lung disease [83] and kidney disease [84].
TIMP1 is also increased in cancer [85] and inflammatory
conditions such as psoriatic arthritis [86].
FibroTest comprises of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase,
total bilirubin, alpha-2-macroglobulin, apolipoprotein A1
and haptoglobin. Factors affecting GGT, haptoglobin and
bilirubin levels have been described under SteatoTest and
summarized in Table 3.
Pro-C3 measures the propeptide cleaved off from the
intact collagen molecule and thus reflects type III collagen
formation [87, 88]. It may also be increased in other
fibrotic diseases, but data is scarce.
Imaging studies
Ultrasound elastography
Vibration-controlled transient elastography measures the
velocity of shear wave in the liver parenchyma to estimate
liver stiffness [89]. It has been extensively validated
against liver histology [65, 90], and correlates with clinical
outcomes in longitudinal studies [91]. Although validation
studies are fewer, point-shear wave elastography and twodimensional shear wave elastography can be performed
together with a regular ultrasound examination and therefore allow structural examination and hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance within the same session [92].
Pathologies that increase liver stiffness can lead to false
positive diagnosis of advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis
(Table 4). Grossly elevated liver stiffness has been reported
in patients with acute viral hepatitis or acute exacerbation
of chronic hepatitis B [93–95], though these conditions
should have been excluded in the evaluation of NAFLD.
Food intake also increases liver stiffness, probably through
an increase in portal blood flow [96, 97]. Other wellcharacterized causes of spuriously high liver stiffness
include congestive heart failure [98], biliary obstruction
[99] and amyloidosis [100]. Solitary liver lesions such as
hepatic cysts and hemangiomas have also been shown to
increase liver stiffness measurement [101].
In addition, high body mass index and severe hepatic
steatosis have been reported to increase the false positive
rate of vibration-controlled transient elastography
[102–104]. However, the effect of hepatic steatosis is not
easily dissected from that of obesity, and the association
between hepatic steatosis and high liver stiffness has not
been consistently observed in other studies [65].
Nonetheless, a recent study suggests that steatosis does not
increase liver stiffness independent of fibrosis when the XL
probe is used in obese patients [90].
Magnetic resonance imaging
Magnetic resonance elastography measures liver stiffness
by a modified phase-contrast method to image the propagation of shear wave in the liver [105]. By head-to-head
comparison, magnetic resonance elastography has higher
applicability and accuracy than vibration-controlled transient elastography [106, 107]. Although not systematically
studied, factors increasing liver stiffness described above
should also affect the performance of magnetic resonance

elastography. Isolated reports also suggest that liver stiffness measurement by magnetic resonance elastography is
affected by iron overload, sarcoidosis and sinusoidal
obstruction syndrome. We did not identify any study on the
influence of food intake on liver stiffness measurement by
magnetic resonance elastography, though radiologists
usually advise patients to fast before MRI examinations.
Corrected T1 measurement by MRI correlates with
necroinflammation and fibrosis [108, 109], and has been
shown to predict liver-related events in a small study [110].
Data on the confounding factors of corrected T1 are
limited.
Conclusion
Because a substantial number of people in the community
have NAFLD and only a small fraction would eventually
suffer from liver-related complications, non-invasive tests
are preferred as the initial assessment. Many of the available tests have high negative predictive values to exclude
advanced fibrosis and future liver-related events, yet falsepositive diagnoses of advanced disease are common. This
review summarizes the known and potential confounding
factors affecting the performance of non-invasive tests.
Clinicians should interpret test results with caution when
the tests are applied in patients with potential confounding
factors.
