Abstract
Background: Numerous publications suggest an association between herpes virus infection and idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). These reports have employed immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization and/or PCR,
which are susceptible to specificity artifacts.
Methods: We investigated the possible association between IPF and viral RNA expression using next-generation
sequencing, which has the potential to provide a high degree of both sensitivity and specificity. We quantified viral
RNA expression for 740 viruses in 28 IPF patient lung biopsy samples and 20 controls. Key RNA-seq results were
confirmed using Real-time RT-PCR for select viruses (EBV, HCV, herpesvirus saimiri and HERV-K).
Results: We identified sporadic low-level evidence of viral infections in our lung tissue specimens, but did not find
a statistical difference for expression of any virus, including EBV, herpesvirus saimiri and HERV-K, between IPF and
control lungs.
Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publication that employs RNA-seq to assess whether
viral infections are linked to the pathogenesis of IPF. Our results do not address the role of viral infection in acute
exacerbations of IPF, however, this analysis patently did not support an association between herpes virus detection
and IPF.

Background
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive disease with insidious onset in older people that progresses
relentlessly in the absence of therapy to disability and
death [1]. Although multiple risk factors, including viral
infection, have been linked to IPF, studies are inconsistent and its etiology remains unclear. To date, more than
14 viruses have been investigated for a potential role in
initiation and progression of IPF, including RNA viruses
such as Hepatitis C (HCV), and DNA viruses such as
human herpes viruses (HHVs), adenoviruses, human
endogenous retrovirus E (HERV-E), transfusion transmitted virus (TTV) and parvovirus B19 [2–7]. However,
the studies on the relationship between virus expression
and development of IPF are conflicting. While some
studies show that virus infection is associated with IPF,
other manuscripts show no viral association with IPF
[8–11], which may be due to the differences in virus distribution and sensitivity and/or specificity of the techniques employed between studies.
Given the fact that alveolar epithelial cells are abnormal and likely contribute to the pathobiology of IPF, we
believe that epithelial perturbation may contribute to inducing and maintaining IPF. Herpes viruses can infect
many different cell types, including epithelial cells with
two infection stages, the lytic stage and the latent stage.

Both lytic genes and latent genes could interact with cellular genes to contribute to IPF initiation, progression
and/or maintenance. Viral genes may regulate cellular
gene expression and induce fibrogenesis. For example,
Type I collagen can be induced by adenovirus [12].
HSV-1 stimulates endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and
apoptosis [3], and these processes are implicated in the
pathobiology of IPF. HCMV infection induces the unfolded protein response (UPR) and it’s related signaling
pathways elF2alpha kinase PERK, and causes endoplasmic reticulum stress [13]. CMV, KSHV and EBV also induce endoplasmic reticulum stress and the UPR [14].
Murine studies demonstrate that the latent genes of
MHV-68 induce lung fibrosis in mice via TGF-β, vascular endothelial growth factor, CCL2, CCL12, TNF-α and
IFN-γ [15]. EBV lytic gene expression also activates
TGF-β expression in alveolar epithelial cell lines [16]
and in primary corneal epithelial cells [17] where EBV
can induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
[18]. Moreover, the fibrotic cytokine milieu in IPF lung
may activate virus replication and further promote virus
gene expression in fibrotic lung. TGF-β promotes EBV
reactivation from latency to the lytic replication stage
and further induces latent membrane protein expression,
which synergizes with TGF-β1 to induce EMT in lung
epithelial cells [19]. Given these mechanisms, it is reasonable to speculate that viruses may play a role in the
pathogenesis of IPF.
If viruses are responsible for causing IPF, then viral
screening or anti-viral treatment may provide a diagnostic test or a potential treatment. Previously employed
techniques, including immunohistochemistry, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), gene array and PCR,
are not sufficiently sensitive or specific. Thus, a more
sensitive and reliable technique is required to qualify
and quantity viruses at the DNA, or RNA levels. Nextgeneration sequencing offers high sensitivity, specificity
and reproducibility in the detection of low levels of gene
expression as well as a broad dynamic range afforded by
the high sequencing depth. New high throughput technologies have been used to generate comprehensive sequencing data for the identification and quantification of
known and novel genes in several diseases [20]. Moreover, RNA-seq has the potential to further elucidate the
mechanisms of pathogenesis of IPF by identifying novel
viruses not previously implicated by PCR or array based
methods. Here we have utilized RNA-seq for the detection of virus expression in lung tissue from patients with
IPF and their age-matched controls.
Methods
Sample description
Lung tissue samples for the first group were obtained
from remnants of surgical biopsies from the University
of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) according to IRB (approval number N120410001 and 12-334398E). They included 5 control lungs and 12 IPF lungs. The control
lung samples were obtained from histological diseasefree margins from patients undergoing resection of lung
adenocarcinoma. The diagnosis of IPF patients was
made by clinicians, pathologists and radiologists according to diagnostic criteria of the American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society [21]. The
detailed demographics for the first group are available at
GEO along with raw RNA-seq data (accession numbers:
GSE138239 for poly(A) selected RNA-seq data and
GSE138283 for non-poly(A) selected RNA-seq data).
The demographics and description for lung tissue samples for the second and third groups were previously
published [22–24]. IPF patients for the second group of
samples (Pittsburgh) and the third group of samples
(FFPE) were vetted using the 2000 and 2011 ATS/ERS
guidelines respectively [21, 25].
RNA-sequencing data acquisition from IPF and control
lung
For this report, we analyzed RNA expression from 3
groups that in total were derived from 28 IPF and 20
control lung specimens. The first group included samples from 12 IPF patients and 5 controls, and encompassed patients who underwent lung biopsies at the
University of Alabama at Birmingham. Total RNA was
prepared using Qiagen’s RNeasy kit (cat#74104). Poly(A)
selected RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed at
UAB for the first group (one control (3007) and one IPF
(2053) sample was not analyzed by RNA-seq because the
aliquot of RNA was considered to be of insufficient quality for these two samples). We repeated RNAsequencing on this same group at Tulane, but we did
not select for polyadenylation because some viral genes
are not polyadenylated. Non-poly(A) selected RNA-seq
was performed using the Illumina NextSeq 550 located
within the NextGen Sequencing Core at the Tulane
Center for Translational Research in Infection & Inflammation. Ribosomal RNA was removed from 1 μg total
RNA for both poly(A) selected and non-poly(A) selected
RNA-seq, and a library was prepared using TruSeq
stranded mRNA (polyA+) for poly(A) selected RNA-seq
or using TruSeq stranded total RNA ribozero [12] for
non-poly(A) selected RNA-seq from Illumina. The second group, including 10 IPF samples and 10 agematched controls, were from a poly(A) selected RNAseq dataset provided from the University of Pittsburg.
The lung tissue for the Pittsburg group was part of the
LTRC (Lung Tissue Research Consortium) specimen
bank that was funded by NHLBI biospecimen repository.
The third group, including 6 IPF lungs and 5 controls,
was obtained from a RNA-seq dataset downloaded from
Yin et al. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020) 20:81 Page 2 of 12

the sequence read archive (SRA, PRJNA326784, https://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?linkname=bioproject_sra_
all&from_uid=326784), and was generated with nonpoly(A) selected total RNA [24]. RNA from the third
group was isolated from paraffin-embedded tissue. Although we acknowledge that fixation in group 3 had the
potential to damage nucleic acids, RNA-seq for these
samples was considered reliable based on the original report (~ 62 million mapped reads in 116 million reads at
50 bp per sample) [24].
Virome analysis of the RNA-sequencing data
Raw RNA-seq data was aligned to a genome reference
containing the human genome (hg19; genome reference
consortium GRCh37) plus a library of 740 known mammalian viral sequences that have been documented by
the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information). Alignments were performed using the transcript
aligner STAR (Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference) version 2.3.0 and version 2.5.2a. Uniquely mapped
viral and human reads were quantified using in-house
computational pipelines. The first script extracts all the
reads mapping to virus sequences and writes the output
to one file for each sample. The second script takes as
input all the viral sequence information from the first
script and removes any duplicate reads. The output is a
list of all the uniquely mapped viral sequences for each
sample. The third script takes as input the uniquely
mapped reads for each sample and counts the number
of reads mapping to each virus in each sample. The output is a compiled file that contains the virus chromosome name followed by the number of occurrences in
each aligned file. As a complementary approach, we also
analyzed mapped reads using the metatranscriptomics
pipeline, RNA CoMPASS for entire metatranscriptome
analysis [26].
cDNA synthesis and RT-PCR
cDNA was synthesized with 1μg RNA following the
manufacturer’s instructions within the Bio-Rad iScriptm
cDNA Synthesis Kit (cat#170–8891). PCR was performed with 2 μl of 10X diluted cDNA in a 20 μl volume
according to the manufacturer’s protocol (BioRAD
cat#170–8880). PCR conditions: for EBV we used 3 min
at 95 °C, 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 30 s at 60 °C then
40 s at 72 °C [27]; to detect HCV, we followed the
methods of Lin et al. [28]; to detect HHV-7, we followed
Caserta’s method [29]; to detect saimiri expression, we
followed Folcik ‘s method [30] using the primers listed
on Table 1. HERV-K strand-specific nested-RT-PCR
products from primers designed to detect RNAs spliced
at the conventional envelope (env) mRNA splice junction (sense strand, 1 × −env) following the nested-PCR
and quantitative RT-PCR protocol of Agoni et al. [32].
In brief, 1x-env products were amplified with cDNA reverse transcript using primers for RT-env-1-Rev then
nested-PCR with primers env (1) & [31]. The primer sequences used for RT-PCR analysis were listed in Table
1. Relative transcript expression levels were calculated
using the ΔΔCt method and the fold change of relative
transcript expression was calculated by ΔΔCt of IPF/
ΔΔCt of control (CNTL).
Statistical analyses
RT-PCR was performed in triplicate for each sample. In
order to test the significant difference of RT-PCR data
and/or RNA-seq reads (RPHM), we used student’s ttests and F tests that were performed using GraphPad

Prism. T-tests were used to compare differences between
control and IPF groups, and the F tests were employed
to compare variance within the groups (control group or
IPF group). Differential expression analysis of RNA-Seq
was carried out using the EBSeq statistical package. Scatter plots depict the mean with the standard error of the
mean [33]. Statistical significance was defined at an
alpha value of p < 0.05. Results are expressed as mean ±
SEM.
Results
Quantitation of viral gene expression using RNAsequencing
Although we observed that the Shamonda virus averages
10 reads per million human mapped reads (RPHM) in
poly(A) selected RNA-seq, this is likely an artifact and
not true infection because viral reads were detected in
every sample analyzed, including the normal controls. In
addition, manual BLAST showed that the actual reads
hit to human sequences that were mistakenly being
called Shamonda virus, and a few repeat reads have been
clonally amplified and resulting in such a high read
number. The next most commonly detected virus was
human adenovirus C with 1 read per million human
mapped reads (Table 2). The mapped reads of other viruses were very low (under 1 RPHM, Table 2) in poly(A)
selected RNA-seq. This could be due to exclusion of
viral RNA that is not polyadenylated. To detect viral
encoded non-coding RNAs, we performed a non-poly(A)
RNA-seq using ribodepleted RNA libraries for our initial
group 1 samples (5 controls and 12 IPF lungs). Nonpoly(A) selected RNA-seq detected more virus than
poly(A) selected RNA-seq, including tick-born encephalitis virus, herpesvirus 2 (HHV-2, HSV-2), Roseolovirus
(HHV-6B) and EBV (HHV-4, Table 3, Table S3). However, there were no significant differences between control and IPF (Table 3, Tables S3, S4). These data were
confirmed by analysis of viral RNA expression using another non-poly(A) selected RNA-seq datasets (the third
group dataset, Table S5). Overall, none of the samples
from either the control or IPF groups reached a virus
detection threshold high enough to qualify as positive.
We conclude that there are no viruses associated with
IPF tissue samples (Table 2, Table S1).
Screening for EBV, HCV, HHV-7 and herpesvirus saimiri
RNA using real-time RT-qPCR
To confirm our RNA-seq results, we performed serial
RT-qPCR on the first group of specimens (12 IPF and 5
control lung RNAs). This was not performed on the second and third group because we only had the data sets
and not the RNA. EBV has two major infection gene expression programs, the latency associated gene expression program and the lytic gene expression program,
which are uniquely utilized depending on cell type. Since
it is not known which cell type might harbor EBV within
IPF lung, and to avoid “lack of detection” errors due to
EBV infection status, primers spanning the EBV latent
genes, EBNA1, Qp and LMP1, as well as the EBV lytic
gene Zta were employed for RT-qPCR. No EBV latent or
lytic gene expression was detected using RT-qPCR, suggesting that neither the latent nor the lytic forms of EBV
were present in the lungs of IPF patients or the control
group (data not shown). However, using primers that
span the EBV-encoded noncoding small RNAs, EBER1
to EBER2, we detected a very low level of EBERs expression in both the IPF and control specimens, with cycle
threshold [34] values over 33 cycles and with no significant difference between the two groups (Fig. 1a). This
data is consistent with the analysis of the non-polyA selected RNA-seq.
Other ubiquitous herpes viruses have also been reported to be associated with IPF, including herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), HHV-6, − 7 and − 8 and
cytomegalovirus (CMV) [2]. Our RNA-seq data detected
sporadic and very low virus mapped reads per million
human mapped reads (RPHM – reads per million human mapped) for these viruses; HHV-5 with 1 RPHM in
IPF lung and 2 RPHM in control lung; HHV-6 with 1
RPHM read in control and HHV-7 with 2 RPHM in IPF
(Table 2). RT-qPCR Ct values for these viruses were
around 40, and therefore not reliable for quantification
of these HHVs (data not shown). Chronic infection of
HCV has been implicated in liver fibrosis; however, it is
still debatable whether HCV can cause pulmonary fibrosis. While some research indicates that HCV infection
may play an important role in the pathogenesis of IPF
[4, 5], others have not detected HCV RNA in IPF samples, despite detection in some specimens using ELISA
[10, 35]. No HCV mapped reads were detected in any of
our IPF or control lung specimens using RNA-seq
(Table S1). A nested real-time RT-qPCR assay with
primers spanning the 5-UTR of HCV [28, 36] detected
very low levels of HCV transcripts with Ct value over 30
cycles (Fig. 1b). Importantly, the ΔΔCt for HCV was not
significantly different between IPF and controls (Fig. 1b).
More recently, Folcik et al. reported that IPF is associated with herpesvirus saimiri but not with other herpesviruses such as EBV, KSHV, CMV or HSV I/II [30].
They detected herpesvirus saimiri DNA and RNA in all
13 IPF cases and none of their controls. Herpesvirus saimiri is a member of the rhadinovirus genus, which also
includes Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, and
can infect humans and squirrel monkeys without causing
disease. Around 4.0–7.3% of humans are seropositive
and express viral proteins such as viral cyclin D [37]. Although no substantial herpesvirus saimiri virus reads
were detected in any of the IPF and control specimens

using RNA-seq (Table 2 & S1), we still performed RTqPCR to assess expression of herpesvirus saimiri using
primers against viral cyclin D1 and viral ORF73 (a conserved viral gene). We did not detect significant expression of ORF73 in IPF patient samples compared to
controls (data not shown). We observed high expression
of human cyclin D1 (Fig. 2b) and very low expression of
viral cyclin D1 (Ct value over 30, Fig. 2a) in both IPF
and control samples, indicating lack of an association
between herpesvirus saimiri and IPF.
HERV-K gene expression and coverage in IPF patients
HERV sequences make up about 4.9% of the human
genome. HERV-K research has been assessed in autoimmune disorders and oncogenesis, yet to date we are
not aware of any literature to assess its possible role in
pulmonary fibrosis. Recently, RT-PCR results have suggested that HERV-K env mRNA was increased in PBMC
and skin biopsies of morphea/localized scleroderma [38].
This study suggests that HERV-K env may be functionally linked to fibrosis. HERV-K gene expression could
theoretically promote IPF through cell stress, and
HERV-K expression is reported to be higher with EBV
infection [39]. Therefore, we evaluated whether HERV-K
genes are upregulated in IPF lung. Notably, of the viruses analyzed in poly(A) selected RNA-seq, HERV-K
was the virus with the highest read numbers (23 to 83
HERV-K mapped reads per million human mapped
reads in both IPF and control samples) (Fig. 3a & Table
S2). Statistical analysis showed about a 2-fold increase in
the 11 IPF patient samples compared 5 controls in group
1 (Fig. 3a & b). However, no statistical difference was
evident between IPF and controls in the second group
(Fig. 3a & b). These data were confirmed by non-poly(A)
selected RNA-seq in the initial group and the third
group. Non-poly(A) selected RNA-seq detected more
HERV mapped reads than poly(A) selected RNA-seq
(Table 3, Table S4, Table S5). Overall we were not able
to make an association between HERV-K gene expression and IPF.
Quantitative RT-PCR of the HERV-K env and long
terminal repeat (LTR) regions show that the expression
levels of env and LTR were higher in IPF than in controls (two-fold difference, Fig. 3d), which corroborates
the RNA-seq data. Next, strand-specific nested RT-PCR
was performed with primers spanning the HERV-K env
and LTR regions in group 1. The primers were originally
designed to detect viral 1x env splicing transcripts [32].
Since HERV-K can be transcribed from the LTR at either or both directions, the sense strand and anti-sense
strand, we performed strand-specific RT-PCR to detect
the plus strand and the minus strand using forward
(LTR-Fwd) or reverse primers (LTR-Rev) for reverse
strand transcription of the LTR. As shown in Fig. 3c, we
found no statistical difference in expression of env and

LTR from either direction between IPF and controls.
We observed that there were several different sizes of
env spliced transcripts. Eleven of 12 (91.7%) IPF samples
were env positive, compared to 3 of 5 (60%) controls,
and the majority of env transcripts were large in IPF (9
of 11), compared with 1 of 3 env in controls (Fig. 3c). In
summary, the spliced env appears preferentially
expressed in IPF, and we do not yet know whether the
large env may play a role in IPF pathogenesis.
Discussion
Here we used RNA-seq to characterize 740 virus gene
expression profiles in 28 IPF biopsies and 20 agematched controls. RNA-seq did not provide evidence for
an association between any virus and IPF. Studies using
RT-PCR for HERV-K, saimiri, EBV, HHV7 and HCV by
RT-PCR corroborated the RNA-seq results. Our findings
provide a new scope for exploring the causes of IPF by
using the sensitive RNA-seq method.
To enable us to analyze both viral poly(A) and nonpoly(A) mRNA in the same sample, we divided total
RNA extracted from surgical lung biopsies into a poly(A)
enriched fraction via oligo (dT) for poly(A)-selected
RNA-seq, and a non-poly(A) fraction for non-poly(A)-
selected RNA-seq. Similar to eukaryotic mRNAs, viral
mRNAs have two main types: poly(A) and non-poly(A)
transcripts, based on the presence or absence of a
poly(A) tail at their 3′-end. Poly(A) mRNA transcripts
represent the majority of viral mRNA, however some viruses express non-poly(A) mRNA including miRNA and
lncRNA. Important examples are herpesvirus EBVencoded non-coding small RNAs (EBER), and
adenovirus-encoded non-coding RNA VA (viral associated) RNAs. Viral-encoded non-poly(A) RNAs have an
essential role in a variety of physiological conditions and
in several illnesses, including viral life cycle and function,
host cell immune evasion and transformation [40]. Specifically, EBERs are highly abundant in all latently EBVinfected cells and play a significant role in the pathogenesis of EBV infection including contributions to EBVmediated oncogenesis such as Burkitt’s lymphoma, gastric carcinoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma through
regulation of apoptosis and/or several cytokines [41]. As
such, EBERs are the gold standard clinic markers for

detection of EBV latent infection in specimens. For this
reason, we analyzed viral poly(A) and non-poly(A)
mRNAs separately on the same sample from the first
group.
EBV appears to be the most commonly investigated
virus in IPF. Previous research has suggested that IPF is
linked to EBV, while other studies, using some common
techniques such as PCR with primers from the EBV
BamHI W repeats or the EBER gene, FISH with an
EBER probe, and IHC with antibody against the viral
capsid antigen (VCA) or the latent membrane protein 1,
have found no link [9]. Here, we did not detect EBV latent or lytic gene expression differences using RNA-seq
or real-time RT-qPCR between the lungs of IPF patients
compared to control lungs. Nevertheless, we detected
very low level of EBER in both IPF and control lung with
no difference between the two groups, and this is not
unexpected since most people are latently infected with
EBV. Notably, EBV EBERs are the most highly expressed
EBV latent genes, typically with greater than 1 million
RNA molecules per cell [42]. EBERs were detected at
very low-levels in the non-poly(A) selected RNA-seq
dataset (Table S3) and in real-time RT-qPCR, but not in
poly(A) selected RNA-seq. Their quantification failed to
demonstrate enhancement of EBV gene expression in
IPF specimens, thus implying that the EBV virus is not
associated with IPF lung any more than with normal
lung.
HERV-K expression was examined because some reports have indicated that it is elevated in other fibrotic
diseases and because conceptually HERV-K could promote fibrogenesis by inducing cellular stress. Moreover,

HERV-K expression is reportedly enhanced in response
to herpes virus infection. HERV-K protein NP9 can
negatively regulate EBV EBNA2 expression by binding
to EBNA2 [43]. The env-encoded superantigens SAg
and NP9 were increased in EBV-transformed lymphocytes, and further studies have demonstrated that the
EBV genes LMP2A and LMP1 transactivate HERV-K
gene expression [44, 45]. Given the reported association
between EBV and HERV-K, we hypothesized that gene
expression of EBV and HERV-K should have a positive
correlation. As such, we performed RT-PCR for HERVK and EBV, and found expression of HERV-K env and
LTR, but no or low expression of EBV (Fig. 2 and Fig.
1a). The absence of differences in overall HERV-K expression between IPF and control data further supports
the concept that there is no association between EBV
and IPF.
Although RNA-seq is highly sensitive technique to detect virus, there are still some limitations in our study.
Most of the mapped viral reads detected in our study
were low except for HERVs, and this potentially could
be due to the quality of RNA-seq or the script used in
our research. Additionally, the expression of RNA viruses is difficult to differentiate from genome detection
despite the fact that viral RNA may indeed reveal expression of DNA viruses such as herpes. For persistent
DNA viruses with very limited expression such as HBV,
a strategy restricted to the detection of RNA such as
RNA-seq, may miss these viruses. Finally, although a
greater number of tissue samples would add to the confidence of our findings, we suggest the lack of significant
findings in 28 IPF lungs from 3 different sources is compelling. Although our sample size makes it very unlikely
to have missed a significant difference in expression of
viral gene expression in common viruses, such as EBV,
we are not able to fully exclude that there may be a
small percentage of patients with IPF, or a specific IPF
phenotype, that have expression viral RNA in lung.
This study has bearing as clinical investigators are considering anti-herpesvirus therapy as a treatment for IPF.
A similar scenario existed for glioblastoma multiforme
(GBM) in which, based on IHC, in situ hybridization,
western blotting and RT-PCR, CMV was entertained as
a causative factor for this fatal disease [46]. A clinical

trial using anti-viral therapy to treat GBM was not effective [47]. Only after conclusion of the trial did next
generation sequencing data come to light that refuted
the role of CMV in GBM [48]. Our data indicates that a
clinical trial employing anti-herpesvirus medication for
the treatment of IPF would be unwarranted, with the
caveat that it does not address so called acute exacerbations of IPF.
Conclusions
Our study employs next generation RNA-sequencing to
assess whether viral infections are linked to the pathogenesis of IPF for the first time. Although quantification
of viral RNAs using RNA-seq in IPF lung specimens
does not support the role of viral infection in acute exacerbations of IPF, however, this analysis patently did not
support an association between virus detection especially
herpes virus detection and IPF.
