Abstract
Purpose: Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been evaluated in
several recent studies. The CyberKnife® is an SBRT system that allows for real-time tracking of the tumor. The
purpose of this study was to evaluate the prognostic factors for local control and overall survival following this
treatment.
Patients and Methods: 75 patients with 96 liver-confined HCC were treated with SBRT at the Oscar Lambret
Comprehensive Cancer Center. Fiducials were implanted in the liver before treatment and were used as markers to
track the lesion’s movement. Treatment response was scored according to RECIST v1.1. Local control and overall
survival were calculated using the Kaplan and Meier method. A stepwise multivariate analysis (Cox regression) of
prognostic factors was performed for local control and overall survival.
Results: There were 67 patients with Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) Class A and eight patients with CTP Class B.
Treatment was administered in three sessions. A total dose of 40–45 Gy to the 80% isodose line was delivered. The
median follow-up was 10 months (range, 3–49 months). The local control rate was 89.8% at 1 and 2 years. Overall
survival was 78.5% and 50.4% at 1 and 2 years, respectively. Toxicity mainly consisted of grade 1 and grade 2
events. Higher alpha-fetoprotein (aFP) levels were associated with less favorable local control (HR=1.001; 95% CI
[1.000, 1.002]; p=0.0063). A higher dose was associated with better local control (HR=0.866; 95% CI [0.753, 0.996];
p=0.0441). A Child-Pugh score higher than 5 was associated with worse overall survival (HR= 3.413; 95% CI [1.235,
9.435]; p=0.018).
Conclusion: SBRT affords good local tumor control and higher overall survival rates than other historical controls
(best supportive care or sorafenib). High aFP levels were associated with lesser local control, but a higher treatment
dose improved local control.

Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has become one of the
leading causes of death in cirrhotic patients [1]. Tumour stage,
liver function and patient general condition are the main
prognostic factors in HCC. Among the available classifications,
the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) classification is
endorsed by both US and European associations for the study
of liver diseases and oncology [2]. Surgery is the standard of
care for these patients, but only 10–30% of patients are eligible
for this treatment. When surgery is not possible, therapeutic
options include percutaneous alcohol injection, radiofrequency
ablation (RFA) [3] and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE)
[4]. When these options are not feasible, recommendations
include best supportive care, sorafenib [5] or radiotherapy [6],
performed alone or in combination [7].
Three local modalities are actually recognized as curative
treatment options for patients with early-stage hepatocellular

carcinoma: liver transplant, surgical resection, and
percutanuous radiofrequency ablation. Palliative treatments
include sorafenib, radiotherapy and TACE [8]. Conformal
radiotherapy and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) are
not included as curative options in the European Association
for the Study of the Liver practical guidelines [9] and are
consequently rarely discussed during tumor boards.
Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) delivers high
radiation doses with precision and has been used to treat
patients without other therapeutic options in clinical situations
as diverse as inoperable recurrent head and neck squamouscell carcinoma [10] or pelvic recurrences in a previously
irradiated area [11]. Liver SBRT, pioneered almost 20 years
ago by Blomgren et al. [12], can be used to treat secondary
[13] or primary tumors and is an option for local treatment of
HCC patients ineligible for surgery, TACE, chemotherapy, or
RFA. This treatment technique has shown enticing rates of
local control and low toxicity [14]. Ultimately, SBRT could be an
alternative to existing local treatments. CyberKnife®(Accuray
Incorporated, Sunnyvale, California, U.S.A.) is a robotic imageguided system that delivers hypofractionated SBRT with
intrafraction motion detection and correction. Other possible
techniques include Novalis Tx® (Brainlab AG, Feldkirchen,
Germany) and TrueBeam® (Varian, Palo Alto, California,
U.S.A.).
We already published results in patients treated for primary
and secondary liver lesions [15]. This study reports the results
of SBRT in an updated and expanded population of patients
treated for hepatocellular carcinoma only. The primary
objective was to determine the prognostic factors of tumor local
control and overall survival for these patients, in order to better
distinguish patients who are most likely to benefit from this
treatment option from those that are not.
Materials and Methods
Seventy-five HCC patients (12 women and 63 men) were
treated with SBRT from July 2007 to November 2011. The
patients included in the study had HCC, an Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score of
less or equal to 2, pre-treatment Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP)
(Table 1) scores A5–B8, and ineligibility for surgical resection,
TACE, RFA, or sorafenib. Main reasons for ineligibility were
inoperable patients and size or location of the tumor
incompatible with RFA or TACE procedures. Diagnosis was
established based on biopsy or according to the Barcelona
criteria [16]. Patients could have no more than three lesions in
order to qualify. Any previous treatments could include TACE,
chemotherapy, surgery, or RFA. Patients did not have any
distant metastases. Median follow-up for surviving patients was
10.0 months (range, 3–49 months).
Cases were discussed in a multi-disciplinary HCC board
consisting of a hepatologist, a hepatic surgeon, a radiation
oncologist, a medical oncologist, and a radiologist. This
retrospective, single-institution, cross-sectional study was
approved by our Institutional Committee on Human Research.
Treatment Planning and Delivery
All patients were treated with CyberKnife. Real-time tracking
of tumor movements was performed with MultiPlan®(Accuray)
treatment planning software and Synchrony®(Accuray)
respiratory tracking system. Gold seeds measuring 0.88 mm in
diameter by 5 mm in length (Ab Medica, Milan, Italy) were
implanted around each lesion. Treatment planning CTs were
performed at least 7 days after fiducial placement. Patients
were immobilized either in a vacuum mattress or a selfexpanding foam mattress in the treatment position (supine). A
spiral CT scan without contrast and a three-phase scan with
contrast (arterial, portal, and late phases) were acquired for
planning. Slice thickness was 1 mm. 4D-CT was not used. The
gross tumor volume (GTV) was contoured on the contrastenhancing disease visible on the partial exhale contrastenhanced CT scan. Patients were asked to exhale and then
hold their breath thereby eliminating the nooed for a gated
scan. Tumor tracking was performed during treatment using
the inserted fiducials. The clinical target volume (CTV) was
defined as the GTV with a geometrical 10-mm margin in all
directions within the liver (institutional standard). A 1.5 mm
margin was applied to the CTV to obtain the planning target
volume (PTV). A total dose of 24–45 Gy in three fractions of
8-15 Gy each was prescribed to the 80% isodose line (95%
PTV coverage) and delivered to the PTV over 10–12 days. The
dose was adjusted as necessary in order to remain within the
dose constraints of the normal tissues and surrounding organs
at risk. Dose constraints are shown in table 1.
Patient follow-up
Each patient had a clinical and biological evaluation 6 weeks
after the completion of the treatment. Clinical, and radiological
follow-up was performed every 3 months during the first 15
months following treatment and every 6 months thereafter. At
each follow-up visit, a CT scan or MRI was obtained. All
images were reviewed by a radiologist who classified
responses as partial, complete, or progressive disease based
on the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(mRECIST)[17]. Toxicity was evaluated according to the
National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria
for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0[18].
Statistics
The R statistical package version 2.15.0 (R Development
Core Team, 2012) was used for the statistical analyses. Time
to local failure was defined from the last treatment session.
Rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
Differences among survival curves were compared using the
log-rank test. The univariate analyses of local control were
performed using the Cox regression model. A p value <0.05
was chosen as the significance threshold. A stepwise
multivariate analysis with cox regression of prognostic factors
was performed for local control and overall survival.

Results
Patient and treatment characteristics
Median age was 70 years (range, 44–86 years). Cirrhosis
was due to alcohol consumption for 57 patients (76%), to viral
hepatitis for11 patients (14.9%), to hemochromatosis for 6
patients (8.1%) and to NASH for 1 patient (1%). Median alphafetoprotein (AFP) level was 18.8 ng/ml (range, 1–3091 ng/ml).
A majority of the patients (44 patients, 60.3%) had CTP A
cirrhosis. Half of the patients had already received treatment
for HCC (51% of the treated targets), the majority with
chemoembolization (22 targets, 23.7%). One patient (1,3%)
had already received radiation therapy. Median tumor diameter
was 37 mm (range, 30–145 mm). Median number of treated
lesions per patient was 1. Patients’ characteristics are shown in
Table 2 Median sum of GTVs was 130.7 cm3 (range, 34–713.7
cm3) and median hepatic volume was 1557 cm3 (range, 841–
3432 cm3). In most cases, four fiducials were inserted near the
tumor before the treatment (61.3% of cases). Mean fraction
length was 103.9 minutes (range, 35.7–156 minutes), median
number of beams per treatment was 148 (range, 29–254
beams), and median total dose was 45 Gy (range, 24–45 Gy)
with a mean 15 Gy (range, 8–15 Gy) delivered per fraction.
Treatment characteristics are presented in Table 3.
Tumor local control rate
Ninety-six targets were treated and individually evaluated for
75 patients. The actuarial 1- and 2-year local control rate was
89.8%. Seven targets (7.3%) in six patients (8%) locally
progressed after treatment. Eighteen hepatic recurrences
(24%) at a distance from the target were observed. Six patients
had distant metastasis after treatment. Kaplan-Meier curve for
tumor local control is presented in Figure 1.
We performed a univariate analysis to identify prognostic
factors affecting local control. Patients with a Cancer of the
Liver Italian Program (CLIP) score higher than 2 were more
likely to relapse (HR=10.127; CI95=2.182, 47.12; p=0.0031). A
lower risk of relapse was observed when a higher radiation

(HR=0.8634; CI95=0.789, 0.945; p<0.0001). In multivariate
analysis, a higher total dose remained significantly associated
with a lower risk of relapse (HR=0.866; CI95=0.753, 0.996;

Overall survival rate
Disease-free survival (DFS) was 61.7% at 1 year and 31.8%
at 2 years. A univariate analysis identified two factors
associated with DFS. Targets already treated with
chemoembolization were more likely to relapse (HR=2.9595;
CI95=1.390, 6.302; p=0.0049). Higher doses per fraction were
associated with better DFS (HR=0.7537; CI95=0.632, 0.899;
p=0.0016). Overall survival at 1 and 2 years were 78.5% and
50.4%, respectively. The median overall survival was 15
months (95% CI). The Kaplan-Meier curve for overall survival is
presented in Figure 1. A univariate analysis followed by a
multivariate analysis of the factors associated with overall
survival was performed. In univariate analysis, patients with a
CTP score higher than 7 appeared to have shorter overall
survival (HR=4.3309; CI95=1.128, 16.624; p=0.0327). In line
with this, patients with more than two treated targets also had
shorter overall survival (HR=6.2630; CI95=1.549, 25.327;
p=0.0101). The multivariable analysis included the following
factors: alcohol consumption, AFP initial measurements, CTP
score (<=7 vs >7), CLIP score (<=1 vs >1), number of treated
targets (=1 vs >1), sum of the size of the treated lesions, sum
of the GTVs, sum of the PTVs and total dose, dose/
fraction.CTP score higher than 7 remained a significant
predictive factor associated with worse overall survival
(HR=3.413; CI95=1.235, 9.435; p=0.0180). Detailed results are
presented in table 5.
Toxicity from radiation exposure
Overall the treatments were well tolerated. The most
common toxicities were hepatic pain (17.1%), nausea (17.1%),
vomiting (15.8%), and asthenia (15.8%), with most patients
having a grade 1 or grade 2 toxicity. No radiation-induced liver
disease (RILD) was observed, but five patients (6.6%) had
decompensated cirrhosis three months later. One of the first
treated patients, presented with a grade 4 gastric ulcer
following treatment, resulting in a digestive hemorrhage. For
this patient, the treated target was in the proximity of the
stomach. Following observation of this toxicity, the treatment
plans were reviewed and strict dose constraints were defined
for subsequent treatments (V15 Gy<3 cm3). Toxicities are
summarized in table 6. A univariate analysis was performed to
find prognostic factors for hepatic pain, hyperbilirubinemia,
nausea, vomiting, asthenia, and decompensated cirrhosis. No
factor was predictive for hepatic pain or hyperbilirubinemia.
Treatment session duration was predictive of nausea
(OR=1.029; p=0.0477), vomiting (OR=1.034; p=0.04). The
aggregate sum of the Gross Tumor Volumes was also
predictive of vomiting (OR=1.004; p=0.0236), i.e., patients with
larger tumors had a more elevated risk of vomiting. Patients
with larger healthy liver volumes were less likely to
decompensate their cirrhoses (OR=0.998; p=0.006).
Discussion
Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is not included as a
curative option in the European Association for the Study of the
Liver practical guidelines [9]. Of note, concerns have been
raised about the possibility of radiation-induced liver disease
for patients treated with external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT),
which encumbered the inclusion of EBRT in the therapeutic
strategies for cirrhotic patients. This is despite almost 20 years
have now passed since Blomgren et al. have pioneered SBRT
for liver malignancies [12].
Since then, most studies published about SBRT for liver
tumors have contained both liver metastases and
hepatocellular carcinoma. Articles about SBRT for HCC alone
are scarce. Most of these studies are retrospective, like ours,
or with a very limited number of patients. We present here the
largest study in terms of both patients (75) and the number of
lesions (96) treated.

In Blomgren’s articles, 42 tumors in 31 patients (eight with
HCC) were treated. Dose per fraction ranged from 7.7 to 30
Gy (mean, 14.2 Gy). Treatments consisted of one to four
fractions delivering a total mean dose of 8 to 66 Gy to the PTV,
respectively. The local control rate in the study was 80%. Since
then, SBRT for HCC has been explored as a local salvage
treatment after incomplete transarterial TRACE [19], as a
bridge to transplantation [20] or for recurrence treatment [21].
Four prospective studies have been published regarding
patients with HCC treated with SBRT. In the study by MendezRomero et al [22], 25 patients with liver tumors, including eight
patients with HCC, were treated. Two fractionation regimens
were prescribed depending on the tumor diameter, i.e. ,
patients with tumors smaller than 4 cm received 37.5 Gy in
three fractions, while patients with tumors larger than 4 cm had
25 Gy in five fractions. Patients who presented with local failure
were all in this latter group. Due to the occurrence of these
failures, the dose was increased to 30 Gy in three fractions for
patients with tumors larger than 4 cm. One-year local control
was 75% and 1-year survival rate 48%. One patient with CTP B
cirrhosis experienced grade 5 RILD. Two years later, Tse et al
published their own prospective study, a phase 1 trial with 41
patients among whom 31 had HCC [23]. Radiation dose was
adapted according to predicted liver toxicity, based on a normal
tissue complication model [24]. Median dose was 36 Gy
(range, 24–54 Gy) in six fractions. Median tumor volume was
173 cm3 (range, 9–1913 cm3). No patients were diagnosed with
RILD, although 26% had grade 3 liver enzymes elevation. Oneyear local control rate was 65% and median survival was 11.7
months. In 2010, Cardenes published a phase I trial of SBRT
for HCC with 17 patients (25 lesions). No dose-limiting toxicity
was reported following an escalated 48 Gy in three fractions
introduced in one to two fractions per week to patients with
Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) A cirrhosis. In line with previous
Figure 1. Kaplan Meier curves for local control and overall survival.

studies, patients with CTP B cirrhosis experienced higher
toxicity: four out of the five CTP B patients had grade 3 or
higher liver toxicity, with an overall survival less than 6 months.
Three retrospective studies have been published with HCConly patients treated with SBRT. Forty-two patients were
treated with 30 to 39 Gy in three fractions in the Kwon et al
study [25]. Median follow-up was 29 months. At 1 and 3 years,
in-field-progression-free survival was 72% and 68%,
respectively. Overall 1- and 3-year survival rates were 92.9%
and 58.6%, respectively. Patients experienced grades 1–2
toxicity but one patient died with extrahepatic metastasis and
radiation-induced hepatic failure. The same year, Seo et al
published a study including 38 patients with HCC treated with
33 to 57 Gy in three to four fractions [26]. Local control rate and
overall survival were 79% and 68%, respectively. Dose was
identified as an independent prognostic factor for survival, i.e.,
patients treated with 42 Gy in three fractions had an 81% 2-
year survival rate, while patients who received a lower dose
had a 25% rate. It is, nevertheless, difficult to draw strong
conclusions considering the limited number of patients in this
study. Six patients experienced a decline in liver function and
one patient had a grade 3 musculo-skeletal toxicity. More
recently, Andolino et al have reported on 60 patients treated
with SBRT for liver-confined HCC [27]. Like in the MendezRomero study, dose was adapted to the CTP score of the
patients, i.e., the median number of fractions, dose per fraction,

and total dose were three, 14 Gy, and 44 Gy, respectively, for
those with class A cirrhosis and five, 8 Gy, and 40 Gy,
respectively, for those with class B. The 2-year local control
and overall survival were 90% and 67%, respectively.
Regarding toxicity, 13% of the patients experienced an
increase greater than one grade of hematologic and
hepatologic dysfunction.
More recently, two studies were reported regarding patients
with active HCC unsuitable for standard locoregional therapies
treated with SBRT [28]. 102 patients were evaluable : local
control at 1 year was 87% (95% CI, 78% to 93%). Like in our
study, SBRT dose was associated with local control on
univariate analysis. Median overall survival was 17.0 months
(95% CI, 10.4 to 21.3 months). This study and our study’s
overall survival rates compare favorably with best supportive
care and even with sorafenib [29,30] the only other potentially
available therapy for these patients.
In these seven studies, SBRT showed high local control
rates in the range of 70–90% at 1 year. Our results, regarding
local control is similar to what has already been reported in the
previous studies, suggesting that SBRT is an effective
treatment, even for those previously treated for HCC. We
showed that total dose was a prognostic factor for local control
in multivariate analysis, further supporting the importance of
this factor for the success of the treatment. In the present
study, the 2-year survival rate was 50.4%, which is slightly
lower than that in the other studies. This could be attributed to
the fact that only ineligible patients for surgery, or those with
relapsed HCC after a failed prior treatment, were included,
indicating that these patients had less favorable prognoses to
begin with. This higher mortality cannot be attributed to
treatment toxicity, since it was found to be very low. In view of
the large proportion of multifocal tumors in our study population
and the difficult tumor sites for operation, this slightly lower
survival rate is not surprising.
CTP B is recognized as a prognostic factor for overall
survival and our analysis confirmed that patients with a higher
score had lower overall survival. This could also hint at the fact
that patients with advanced cirrhosis are more likely to die from
liver failure. The toxicity of SBRT consists mainly of liver
dysfunction. Other toxicities (pain, fatigue, nausea, and
vomiting) were not dose-limiting, which was also the case in
our study. A particular attention should be paid to patients with
CTP B score since they are more likely to experience liver
failure after SBRT. Our study did not confirm that result, even
though we did find that patients with larger healthy liver
volumes were less like to decompensate their cirrhosis.
Conclusion
SBRT is an effective and safe treatement. In a population of
patients without other curative local treatment options, SBRT
shows sustained local control, associated with survival rates
higher than historical controls, with a low risk of serious toxicity.
Further randomized trials are required to compare his efficacy
and safety to RFA and TACE.
