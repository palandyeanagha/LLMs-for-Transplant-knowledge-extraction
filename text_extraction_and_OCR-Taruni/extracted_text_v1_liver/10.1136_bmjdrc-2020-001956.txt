ABSTRACT
Introduction Sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) 
inhibitors have been reported to benefit liver functions 
in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) with non-alcoholic 
fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The aim of this study is to 
critically appraise existing systematic reviews in order 
to consolidate evidence associating the use of SGLT2 
inhibitors with beneficial hepatic results for patients with 
T2D with NAFLD.
Methods This umbrella review searched relevant 
published systematic reviews of clinical trials from 
PubMed and Embase between inception and September 
16, 2020. Two independent investigators appraised study 
quality using AMSTAR2 (Assessment of Multiple Systematic 
Reviews 2). The hepatic effects from SGLT2 inhibitors 
were summarized based on liver enzymes, liver fat, liver 
histology, liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Results Of 25 screened potential systematic reviews, we 
ultimately included 7 in this study. However, none of them 
could be rated as being of high methodological quality. 
Five systematic reviews indicated that SGLT2 inhibitors 
could effectively decrease liver fat and liver parameters of 
alanine aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase 
in patients with NAFLD. Two systematic reviews indicated 
that SGLT2 inhibitors could reduce hepatosteatosis, as 
supported by biopsy-proven evidence of improvement 
from a small clinical trial, but no evidence of liver fibrosis 
improvement was found.
Conclusions There is some association between SGLT2 
inhibitor use and observed benefits to liver functions 
in patients with T2D with NAFLD, although the quality 
of current systematic reviews remains relatively low. 
Further evaluation of long-term liver outcomes with SGLT2 
inhibitors in cases of liver cirrhosis and liver cancer is 
warranted.
BACKGROUND
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and non-alcoholic 
fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are both common 
and frequently occur together, whereby they 
can act synergistically, furthering undesirable 
outcomes.1 The prevalence of NAFLD among 
patients with T2D was 55.5%,2 and one out 
of five patients with T2D with normal liver 
functions had biopsy-proven non-alcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH).3
 The risk of developing cardiovascular complications of 
diabetes is increased when both T2D and 
NAFLD are present, as is the risk of greater 
severity of NAFLD, such as liver cirrhosis, liver 
cancer and death.4–6
Significance of this study
What is already known about this subject?
► Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is closely related to nonalcoholic liver disease (NAFLD) and probably increases the risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular 
carcinoma.
► Several systematic reviews have reported sodium 
glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, a novel 
antihyperglycemic medication, has beneficial liver 
effects in patients with T2D with NAFLD; however, 
comprehensive review of the current evidence available on SGLT2 inhibitors and liver outcomes remains 
unclear.
What are the new findings?
► SGLT2 inhibitors could improve liver enzymes, including alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl 
transferase, and liver fat, in patients with T2D with 
NAFLD.
► SGLT2 inhibitors could reduce hepatosteatosis, as 
supported by biopsy-proven evidence of improvement from a small clinical trial, but no evidence of 
liver fibrosis improvement was found.
How might these results change the focus of 
research or clinical practice?
► The use of SGLT2 inhibitors is a potentially rational 
option for patients with T2D with NAFLD since current evidence supports that SGLT2 inhibitor use is 
associated with liver enzyme and liver fat reduction 
in patients with T2D with NAFLD.
► Further studies conforming to high scientific standards are required to bridge the gap in evidence 
regarding SGLT2 inhibitor use and long-term liver 
outcomes, such as liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.

Pharmacotherapies for patients with T2D with NAFLD 
have not been established. Metformin, the first-line antidiabetes medication in T2D, is generally not suggested as 
specific therapy for NAFLD because its beneficial effect 
on liver histology has not been proven.7 Although pioglitazone has been shown to have favorable effects on NASH 
histology,8 side effects including weight gain, retention 
of fluid, cancer occurrence and bone fracture limit its 
clinical use.9 Some studies have indicated that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 
receptor agonists were of benefit to patients’ liver functions. However, only a few of these studies supported their 
use in patients with T2D with NAFLD.10–12 Therefore, lifestyle modifications, including diet and physical activity, 
remain the mainstay of current therapy for patients with 
T2D with NAFLD.13 14
Sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are novel antidiabetic medications that increase 
the excretion of urinary glucose and thus lower blood 
glucose levels. In addition to their hypoglycemic effects, 
SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to offer several favorable pleiotropic effects on patients’ body weight and liver 
enzymes that may potentially improve or prevent the 
progression of NAFLD.15 16 Although some systematic 
reviews and meta-analyses have demonstrated the hepatic 
benefits from SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with T2D with 
NAFLD, the quality of these systematic reviews has not 
been evaluated.17
Umbrella review is a useful tool to gain comprehensive overview of systematic reviews and meta-analyses 
published on a specific topic by examining the studies’ 
strengths and risks of bias.18 We performed an umbrella 
review to critically appraise existing systematic reviews 
to consolidate evidence of associations between use 
of SGLT2 inhibitors and beneficial hepatic effects in 
patients with T2D with NAFLD and to identify current 
unmet needs with regard to this topic.
METHODS
Search strategy
We searched PubMed and Embase to identify systematic 
reviews of SGLT2 inhibitors for patients with T2D with 
NAFLD published between inception and September 16, 
2020. Searches were supplemented by manually reviewing 
reference lists to find relevant articles in included systematic reviews. The search strategy combined selected 
keywords (eg, SGLT2 inhibitors and NAFLD) with MeSH 
or Emtree terms and directed clinical queries for systematic reviews (eg, systematic (sb) in PubMed). Languages 
were not restricted. We present the full search strategy 
applied to the two databases in online supplemental 
table 1.
Screening and final selection of systematic reviews
The articles to be included were independently selected 
by two reviewers (S-CS and L-TK) following the criteria 
defined in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement (online 
supplemental table 2). Articles eligible for inclusion were 
systematic reviews as identified by presentation consistent 
with the PRISMA statement,19 examining the effectiveness of SGLT2 inhibitors for T2D with NAFLD in clinical trials. We did not include references from animal 
studies or conference abstracts. Full-text articles of all 
references that appeared relevant were assessed individually, whereby disagreements between the reviewers were 
resolved by discussion.
Data extraction
The same reviewers then extracted relevant data from 
the systematic reviews selected. The main information 
thus retrieved from each review was then classified as 
relating to study authors and year, number of included 
studies and participants, country, exposure, duration and 
main findings. It is presented in a table.
Assessment of methodological quality
Assessment of the methodological quality of the systematic reviews selected for inclusion was performed by 
two independent reviewers (S-CS and L-TK), following 
the ‘Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews 2’ 
(AMSTAR2) criteria. These criteria offer a broadly used 
and reproducible way to evaluate systematic reviews of 
randomized controlled trials for their methodological 
quality.20 The AMSTAR2 assessment is derived from the 
results of 16 inquiries (domains) covering issues such 
as the following: evidence of a review protocol having 
been registered prior to study commencement; whether 
literature search is conducted to an adequate degree; 
where individual studies are excluded, the provision of 
justification therefor; acknowledgment and assessment 
of possible bias arising in the studies; the suitability of 
applied meta-analytic procedures; to what degree bias 
risks are taken into consideration in the interpretation of 
review results; and whether publication bias might arise 
and its likely impact. The responses are ‘Yes’ for positive 
or ‘No’ for negative or unknown, with ‘Partial Yes’ indicating incomplete adherence to the criteria. After discussion, the two reviewers (S-CS and L-TK) awarded each 
study a rating for its methodological quality. The ratings 
were ‘high’, ‘moderate’, ‘low’ or ‘critically low’, based on 
the outcome of the AMSTAR2 inquiries.
Data analysis
We carried out a descriptive analysis for the included 
systematic reviews. We summarized the conclusions drawn 
by the systematic reviews regarding SGLT2 inhibitors and 
the liver outcomes of interest, including liver enzymes 
(eg, aspartate aminotransferase, AST; alanine aminotransferase, ALT; gamma-glutamyl transferase, GGT), 
liver fat, histology, cirrhosis and liver cancer. Whenever 
more than one systematic review had been performed on 
the same liver outcome, we examined whether the main 
reported conclusions were concordant.

RESULTS
We found a total of 25 records by applying the keywords 
described aforementioned in PubMed and Embase. After 
removing duplicates and examining titles and abstracts, 
we found seven systematic reviews of clinical trials that 
met the study inclusion criteria. We present the selection 
process by PRISMA chart in figure 1.
Quality assessment
The application of the AMSTAR2 assessment standard 
yielded ‘moderate’ confidence in the review results for 
only one of the systematic reviews included, meaning it 
had more than one non-critical weakness. ‘Low’ confidence was found for the results of three of the reviews, 
implying they had one critical flaw, regardless of other 
non-critical weaknesses. ‘Critically Low’ was the AMSTAR2 
rating for confidence in the results of the remaining three 
reviews, meaning they displayed more than one critical 
flaw, regardless of non-critical weaknesses (table 1). Analysis of the 16 domain responses revealed that of the seven 
included systematic reviews, six were negative with regard 
to the same four domains: provision of a protocol prior to 
review commencement (second domain); listing excluded 
studies and justifying their exclusion (seventh domain); 
reporting any funding sources of the studies they included 
(tenth domain); and evaluating how the risk of bias in 
individual studies might impact the interpretation of the 
results (thirteenth domain). By contrast, all the systematic reviews included were positive for the following three 
domains: presentation of research questions and inclusion criteria (first domain); selection of study design to 
be included (third domain); and potential conflicts of 
interest and funding sources (sixteenth domain).

Changes in liver enzymes
In four out of seven systematic reviews reporting SGLT2 
inhibitors’ effects on liver enzymes, all, three and two 
studies reported the changes of ALT, AST and GGT levels, 
respectively (table 2). Qualitative findings of included 
systematic reviews indicated that SGLT2 inhibitors could 
effectively reduce these liver parameters in patients with 
NAFLD, compared with the placebo and other active 
comparators. However, the meta-analysis by Kumar et 
al21 showed that, to achieve significance, SGLT2 inhibitors could decrease ALT and GGT levels by −16.17U/L 
(95%CI −21.74 to −10.60) and −19.31 (95% CI −21.13 
to −17.49) while yielding no statistical difference in AST 
reduction (−7.09U/L, 95%CI −17.03 to 2.85). Notably, 
moderate to high heterogeneity among the clinical trials 
of SGLT2 inhibitors and ALT/AST evaluations was found.
Changes in liver fat
Four systematic reviews reported changes in liver fat from 
SGLT2 inhibitors (table 2). The first systematic review 
from Tang et al22 reported no difference in hepatic fat 
content improvement between dapagliflozin and placebo 
(absolute change from baseline assessed by proton 
magnetic resonance spectroscopy, −2.4% vs −1.5%), 
based on findings from a single randomized controlled 
trial. However, the more recent meta-analysis from Xing 
et al23 including two randomized controlled trials, found 
SGLT2 inhibitors could further reduce liver fat content 
by −2.07% (95% CI −3.86 to −0.28) calculated by MRI 
proton density fat fraction, compared with metformin 
or placebo. Notably, another systematic review from 
Pan and Stanley24 showed SGLT2 inhibitors moderately 
improved liver fat content, as determined by the liver 
to spleen attenuation ratio, but the effects were similar 
to the pioglitazone comparator (absolute change from 
baseline: −0.22±0.04 vs −0.21±0.03) in a randomized, 
open‐label, controlled clinical trial.
Changes in liver histology, liver cancer and liver cirrhosis
We found a systematic review by Dougherty et al25 reported 
SGLT2 inhibitors improved liver histology in patients 
with NASH according to findings from a single-arm clinical trial (table 2). However, the recent systematic review 
by Kumar et al21 demonstrated SGLT2 inhibitors may not 
reduce liver fibrosis (standard mean difference: −0.07, 
95%CI −0.33 to 0.19). No systematic review summarized 
the effects on liver cirrhosis and liver cancer after SGLT2 
inhibitor treatment.
DISCUSSION
This umbrella review summarizes existing systematic 
reviews for the purpose of consolidating dispersed 
evidence of associations between use of SGLT2 inhibitors 
and liver outcomes in patients with T2D with NAFLD. We 
found the systematic reviews demonstrated that the use of 
SGLT2 inhibitors was associated with reductions in liver 
enzymes and liver fat in patients with T2D with NAFLD. 
Notably, a clinical trial from one of the systematic reviews 
has proven histological improvement of NASH from liver 
biopsies among patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors.26
However, no sufficient evidence of SGLT2 inhibitors was

seen to significantly improve liver fibrosis. We found no 
study analyzing the association between SGLT2 inhibitor use and incidence of liver cirrhosis and cancer. On 
the basis of evaluation by AMSTAR2, we found current 
systematic reviews to be of moderate and critically low 
quality, suggesting the need for further investigation. 
Although existing systematic reviews support that SGLT2 
inhibitor use may offer beneficial effects on hepatic 
functions in patients with T2D with NAFLD, three major 
issues are noteworthy.
First, the findings from the systematic reviews were 
based on clinical trials and may not be applicable to 
patients in a real-world setting,27 28 because patients with 
hepatic impairment (eg, ALT >2.5–3 times the upper 
reference limit) were not included in the clinical trials. 
Additional real-world evidence is required to address this 
limitation. For example, a recent retrospective multiinstitutional cohort study, which included patients with 
hepatic impairment, demonstrated that the beneficial 
effects on hepatic functions remained consistent.16 In 
addition, given the liver benefits from SGLT2 inhibitors 
in patients with NAFLD have been proven by clinical 
trials with the relatively short observational period (most 
within 56weeks), future studies with longer follow-up of 
patients are warranted.
Second, the underlying mechanisms which drive liver 
function improvement through SGLT2 inhibitors in 
patients with T2D with NAFLD remain unclear. Some 
studies have suggested the decrease in liver enzymes and 
liver fat is related to improvement of blood glucose control 
or body weight after treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors.29 30
However, studies such as the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial 
reported that SGLT2 inhibitors could reduce the ALT 
values even in patients with suboptimal glucose-lowering 
or weight-lowering effects, implying that ALT reduction 
mechanisms might be independent of weight changes or 
changes in hemoglobin A1c levels.31 32 Other studies have 
suggested that potential beneficial hepatic effects of the 
SGLT2 inhibitors may be attributable to suppression of 
hepatic inflammation, attenuation of oxidative stress and 
increase in fatty acid oxidation.33 34 However, the hypothetical mechanisms have not been well verified.
Third, from the systematic reviews, we found no 
evidence regarding the association between SGLT2 
inhibitor use and reduced risk of solid outcomes such 
as liver cirrhosis or liver cancer,35 mainly because the 
included clinical trials did not cover a sufficient time 
period to observe chronic and progressive hepatic 
outcomes. However, an animal study found SGLT2 inhibitors could induce cell cycle arrest and reduce tumor 
growth by direct inhibitions of the SGLT2 in tumor cells, 
and therefore prevent the progression from NASH to 
hepatocellular carcinoma.36 This animal study provides 
foundational background for a real-world study with a 
longer observation time to determine the solid outcomes 
in patients receiving SGLT2 inhibitors.
To the best of our knowledge, this umbrella review of 
multiple systematic reviews is the first to undertake an 
evaluation of the methodological quality of included 
studies focusing on SGLT2 inhibitors for patients with 
T2D with NAFLD. We found the quality of most included 
systematic reviews to be low or critically low. Furthermore, the comparators varied among clinical trials in the 
included systematic reviews, so we suggest the findings 
should be interpreted with caution. Current evidence 
supports the idea that SGLT2 inhibitor use is associated 
with liver enzyme and liver fat reduction in patients with 
T2D with NAFLD. However, liver improvement outcomes 
based on liver biopsy from clinical trials of SGLT2 inhibitors remain scarce. Taken together, the effects on weight 
loss and the associated reduction in risk of cardiovascular 
and renal events, as demonstrated by studies,37 38 make 
the use of SGLT2 inhibitors a potentially rational option 
for patients with T2D with NAFLD. However, future 
research is warranted to verify the risks and benefits of 
SGLT2 inhibitors and to compare longer-term hepatic 
outcomes with other antidiabetes medications in patients 
with T2D with NAFLD.
CONCLUSION
This umbrella overview suggests SGLT2 inhibitors may 
bring about a reduction in liver enzymes and liver fat, 
and probably improving liver histology in patients with 
T2D with NAFLD. However, further studies conforming 
to high scientific standards are required to bridge the gap 
in evidence regarding SGLT2 inhibitor use and long-term 
liver outcomes, such as liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.
