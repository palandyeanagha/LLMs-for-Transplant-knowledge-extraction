The peculiarity of T cell is their ability to recognize an infinite range of self and foreign antigens. This ability is achieved during thymic development through a complex molecular 
mechanism based on somatic recombination that leads to the expression of a very heterogeneous population of surface antigen receptors, the T Cell Receptors (TCRs). TCRs 
are cell specific and represent a sort of “molecular tag” of T cells and have been widely 
studied to monitor the dynamics of T cells in terms of clonality and diversity in several 
contexts including lymphoid malignancies, infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases, 
and tumor immunology. In this review, we provide an overview of the strategies used to 
investigate the TCR repertoire from the pioneering techniques based on the V segments 
identification to the revolution introduced by Next-Generation Sequencing that allows 
for high-throughput sequencing of alpha and beta chains. Single cell based approaches 
brought the analysis to a higher level of complexity and now provide the opportunity to 
sequence paired alpha and beta chains. We also discuss novel approaches that through 
the integration of TCR tracking and mRNA single cell sequencing offer a valuable tool to 
associate antigen specificity to transcriptional dynamics and to understand the molecular 
mechanisms of T cell plasticity.

INTRODUCTION
Human T cells develop in the thymus from progenitors originating in hematopoietic tissues. During 
their development, they acquire the ability to recognize foreign antigens and provide protection 
against many different pathogens. This functional flexibility is guaranteed by the expression of 
highly polymorphic surface receptors called T  cell receptors (TCRs). TCR is composed of two 
different protein chains. The vast majority of human T cells express TCRs composed of α (alpha) 
and β (beta) chains while a small subset expresses TCR composed of γ (gamma) and δ (delta) 
chains. αβ T cells are key mediators of the adaptive immunity and recognize antigens presented in 
association to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class I and Class II proteins. γδ T cells 
instead are not MHC-restricted and are involved in “innate like” responses in tissues. αβ T cells 
represent more than 90% of the total T cell population and are more diversified compared to γδT; 
for this reason the vast majority of the studies to characterize TCR (1) are focused on αβ T cells.
The genes encoding alpha (TCRA) and beta (TCRAB) chains are composed of multiple noncontiguous gene segments which include variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) segments for 
TCRB gene and variable (V) and joining (J) for TCRA gene (2) (Figure 1A). The enormous diversity 
of T cell repertoires is generated by random combinations of germ line gene segments (combinatorial 

Figure 1 | Somatic V(D)J arrangement in the alpha and beta chains. (A) Genomic organization and somatic recombination of TCRB and TCRA loci. Antigen 
repertoire diversity is guaranteed by a recombination step that progressively rearranges V, D, and J segments for T cell receptor (TCR) beta chains and V and J 
segments for TCR alpha chains. This variability (combinatorial diversity) is further increased by addition or deletion of nucleotides at the junction sites (junctional 
diversity). (B) Productive arrangements of beta and alpha transcripts. (C) Organization of TCR. TCR is composed by two subunits TCR alpha and TCR beta each 
organized in a constant region and a variable region responsible for antigen recognition.

diversity) and by random addition or deletion at the junction site 
of the segments that have been joined (junctional diversity).
The sequence encoded by the V(D)J junction is called complementarity determining region 3 or CDR3. This sequence 
has the highest variability in both alpha and beta chains and 
determines the ability of a T  cell to recognize an antigen 
peptide presented by the MHC molecule (3) (Figure  1B). The 
combinatorial variability is further increased by the subsequent 
heterodimeric paring of alpha and beta chains (Figure 1C) and 
total number of possible combination is estimated to exceed 
10e18 (4). T cell repertoire is dynamic and directly reflects the 
diversity of immune responses: antigen presentation to a naïve 
T  cell in fact, in association to co-stimulatory signals, drives a 
rapid clonal expansion of cells carrying identical TCRs to generate a population of “effector cells.” After antigen clearance, a 
reduced number of these cells remain in the blood as “memory 
cells.” The characterization of the TCR repertoire has always been 
of great scientific interest because it accurately describes T cell 
dynamics in a wide range of diseases, including malignancies 
(5, 6), autoimmune disorders (7), and infectious diseases (8, 9).
TCR ANALYSIS FROM PIONEERING
TECHNIQUES TO NEXT GENERATION
SEQUENCING
Pioneering experiments to dissect the T  cell repertoire were 
performed at protein level using flow cytometry and a combination of monoclonal antibodies against the TCRBV subgroups. 
This approach is both qualitative and quantitative but limited 
by the availability of specific monoclonal antibodies and did not 
provide any information about CDR3 diversity (10). The first 
genomic based approaches, instead, were based on the analysis 
of CDR3 sequence length distribution in a population. This 
technique, called Immunoscope or CDR3 Spectratyping (11) is 
based on the electrophoretic analysis of PCR fragments derived 
from amplification of TCR transcripts across the CDR3 region 
using primers specific for the different variable segments and the 
constant region. Immunoscope compares the relative frequencies of different length products within an individual TCRBV 
subfamily, which assume a Gaussian distribution in the case of 
a polyclonal population while it is skewed in the case of clonal 
enrichment. The first molecular approaches used to interrogate 
the TCR repertoire at the nucleotide sequence level were based 
on traditional molecular cloning and Sanger sequencing (12, 13). 
This approach provided a more specific description of TCR 
repertoire but it was not powerful enough to estimate the huge 
TCR diversity. The real breakthrough in the characterization of 
the immune repertoire came from the introduction of highly 
sensitive high-throughput sequencing techniques for massive 
parallel sequencing of millions of DNA molecules instead of 
single clones to provide a comprehensive knowledge of the 
TCR arrangement (alpha chain, beta chain, or both) including 
V–J segments and the complete CDR3 sequence. The current 
sequencing techniques employ a target enrichment step starting 
from genomic DNA or cDNA to both increase the sensitivity and 
reduce the sequencing costs. The commonly used enrichment 
strategies include multiplex PCR, RNA baits enrichment, and 5′
RACE PCR. Multiplex PCR strategies employ a multiplex pool 
of forward PCR primers complementary to all the possible V 
segments and a pool of reverse primers designed on the J segments (if starting from genomic DNA) (8) or on the constant 
region of alpha and beta chain (if starting from cDNA) (14). Both 
approaches present advantages and drawbacks. PCR enrichment starting from cDNA has many advantages over genomic 
DNA: (a) it is less biased by PCR artifacts because the amplified 
fragments do not include introns and are, therefore, smaller; 
(b) cDNA analysis detects only productively arranged segments 
(the “expressed” alpha and beta chains); and (c) it enables an 
easier detection of the less represented sequences because 
mRNA transcripts are more abundant than their template 
genomic DNA. Bait based enrichment employs RNA baits to

capture TCR sequences directly from DNA or RNA sequencing 
(RNA-seq) libraries which are re-amplified after capture. Baits 
are specific for the alpha and beta transcripts and are usually 
conjugated to magnetic beads. This procedure requires few 
amplification cycles reducing the potential of PCR related biases 
(15, 16). The third approach is a transcript based approach that 
employs a 5′RACE after a template-switch step. RNA is reverse 
transcribed by an enzyme endowed with terminal transferase 
activity that adds a stretch of non- template dCTPs at the 3′ end 
of the cDNA. A non-template-switch oligonucleotide containing a poly-G tract then binds to the non-template stretch and 
allows the reverse transcriptase to switch template and to go on 
extending the template up to the end of the oligonucleotide. The 
template-switch oligonucleotide contains a universal sequence 
shared by all the transcripts including TCR chains. A forward 
primer designed on this sequence is then used together with 
reverse primers designed on the constant region of the alpha and 
beta chains to enrich for TCR transcripts amplifying fragments 
that can then be processed to generate sequencing libraries 
(16, 17). The use of genomic DNA as starting material is instead 
more challenging because enrichment is usually performed 
by multiplex PCR but the presence of introns and amplification of longer fragments can introduce more technical biases. 
In addition, non-productive rearrangements are also amplified 
and sequenced complicating the analysis of expressed repertoire. 
This revolutionary approach was first used to characterize the 
TCR repertoire diversity in healthy individuals (18) and rapidly 
adapted to the repertoire analysis in different pathological settings like tumor immunology (5) and autoimmunity (19) and in 
several clinical applications like the monitoring of hematopoietic 
cell transplantation (20). Beta chain has always been the main 
target in all the TCR repertoire studies due to its higher diversity 
related to a larger combinatorial potential compared to alpha 
chain. Moreover, beta chain represents an “unique label” for a 
T cell: T cells undergo a process called “allelic exclusion” that 
leads to the generation of only one productively arranged beta 
chain gene, while both the alpha chain alleles can be expressed 
(21). The limitation of the “bulk” approach resides in the lack 
of information about the pairing of the alpha and beta chain, 
which really reflects the biological function of a T cell in vivo
and can be achieved only with single cell analysis. Single cell 
approaches for TCR repertoire analysis employ two main strategies: a direct target amplification and sequencing starting from 
single cell cDNA or the TCR reconstruction from single cell 
RNA-seq data.
SINGLE CELL TCR ENRICHMENT 
AND SEQUENCING
The first attempts to sequence single cell TCR alpha and beta 
chains used multiplex PCR strategies associated to Sanger 
sequencing (22) or high-throughput sequencing (23). Hans and 
colleagues characterized the heterogeneity of T  lymphocytes 
infiltrating human colorectal carcinoma using a combined multiplex PCR approach to enrich both TCR sequences (Figure 2A) 
and a pool of “phenotyping genes” from the same cells. They also 
implemented a PCR-based single cell barcoding strategy to pool 
all the amplicons and sequence them by NGS. A barcode is a short 
nucleotide sequence that uniquely tags cell transcripts and is used 
to trace mRNA transcripts back to their cellular origins. Through 
this original approach they could associate the TCR sequence to 
specific T cell subsets with different functions. A similar single 
cell barcoding strategy was used to set up high-throughput methodologies to identify clones sharing the same alpha and beta TCR 
sequences and applied to tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes from 
breast and lung cancer (24).
A real breakthrough came with emulsion-based PCR 
techniques (Figure  2B). These techniques employ devices that 
pump oil-in-water emulsion where thousands of single cells can 
be captured into droplets that work like tiny reaction chambers 
along with primer and PCR reagents. This approach allows to 
drastically increase the number of cells processed in parallel and 
enables the generation of representative single cell alpha and beta 
TCR gene libraries fused together. In detail, alpha and beta TCR 
mRNAs are released in each single droplet after cell lysis and are 
reverse transcribed and amplified using multiplex PCR employing primers with overlapping ends. In a subsequent reaction the 
overlapping ends anneal allowing the 3′ end of each strand to 
prime the 3′ extension of the complementary end (25). This step 
generates a fusion fragment containing both the alpha and the 
beta sequence; fusion fragments are then further amplified in a 
PCR containing “blocking” primers that prevent unfused fragments to be amplified (26). Turchaninova and colleagues applied 
this technology to describe the T  cell repertoire from human 
blood but this approach has been extensively applied in many 
areas of research including cancer (27) and recently readapted 
in an ultra-highthroughput platform that allows the TCR paired 
sequencing of millions of cells (28).
TCR RECONSTRUCTION FROM SINGLE
CELL RNA-seq DATA
The development of single cell RNA-seq technologies opened also 
new perspectives for TCR analysis. To date, many different protocols have been developed that mainly differ in the cell isolation 
methods, cDNA synthesis and amplification, and in the library 
preparation steps (29). Single cell isolation methods have rapidly 
evolved in the past few years from manual micromanipulation to 
high-throughput isolation using microfluidics or emulsion-based 
platforms and this has provided huge advantages not only in 
terms of throughput but also in terms of sensitivity and accuracy due to very small reaction volumes employed (30). All the 
sequencing protocols are characterized by a reverse transcription 
and an amplification step before library preparation. The commonly used protocols differ in the amplification step that can be 
performed by PCR or in vitro transcription and are divided into 
two groups: tag based or full-length cDNA sequencing protocols.
Tag-based strategies introduce a “cell barcode” during 
reverse transcription reaction providing the possibility to “tag” 
the whole cDNA pool of a single cell (31–33). “Tag strategies” 
have exponentially increased the throughput because tagged 
cDNAs can be pooled during the amplification and library

Figure 2 | Overview of the available single cell T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing approaches. Direct TCR enrichment and sequencing. In (A) single cell TCR 
transcripts are enriched by a multiplex PCR performed after RT reaction using a pool of forward primers spanning all the annotated productive V alpha and V 
beta fragments and reverse primers designed on the constant region of alpha and beta chains. Barcoded adaptors then are added by PCR enabling pooling and 
sequencing by Next-Generation Sequencing. In (B) cells are captured in water-in-oil droplets using microfluidic emulsion-based devices along with specific RT and 
PCR reagents. In each droplet, TCR alpha and beta transcripts of a single cell are specifically reverse transcribed with RT primers designed on the constant region 
of alpha and beta chain. cDNA is successively amplified using a pool of forward primers designed on all the alpha and beta segments and reverse primers designed 
on the constant region. Alpha and beta primers contain overlapping sequences at their 5′ends that enable the synthesis of TCR alpha and beta fusion sequences 
through an overlap-extension mechanism. Fused molecules are pooled breaking the emulsion and further enriched by a nested amplification and sequenced. TCR 
reconstruction from single cell “full length” RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. (C) Single cells sorted in plates or captured using microfluidic devices are lysed, and 
total mRNA is reverse transcribed with an oligo dT primed reaction. Through a template-switch mechanism a universal sequence is added at the 5′ end of the 
transcript. This sequence, shared with the dT primer used in the RT reaction is then used to amplify cDNA before library preparation. In the library preparation step, 
full-length cDNA is “tagmented” using Transposase and Tag sequences inserted by transposase are then used to amplify cDNA and to insert barcoded sequencing 
adaptors (AD1 and AD2). Libraries are then sequenced and TCR sequences can be extracted from all transcriptome using dedicated bioinformatics algorithms 
(TraCer, TraPes, VDJ Puzzle). Pairing Single cell TCR sequencing and RNA-seq using emulsion-based protocols. (D) Thousands of cells in parallel are partitioned 
into oil-in-water droplets. After a lysis step their mRNA is reverse transcribed using a pool of specific RT primers containing the same “cell barcode” used to tag 
the cell transcriptome, a Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI). UMI is different for each primer enabling the digital counting of mRNA transcripts and sequencing of the 
T7 promoter. cDNA is then amplified by in vitro transcription. After amplification barcoded RNAs are pooled and processed together. Amplified RNA is then used as 
template to enrich for TCR sequences and to generate RNA-seq libraries according to the InDrop protocol. During RNA-seq library preparation RNA is fragmented 
and only the 3′ end of transcripts is sequenced. For TCR enrichment amplified RNA is reverse transcribed using a pool of RT primers spanning V alpha and V beta 
segments and then amplified using “internal” V alpha and beta primers and primers designed on the constant regions. During this PCR reaction sequencing 
adaptors are also added (AD1 and AD2). (E) Thousands of cells in parallel are partitioned into oil-in-water droplets. After a lysis step their mRNA is reverse 
transcribed using an oligo dT primer. Through a template-switch mechanism, a primer containing a cell barcode and a UMI is added at the 5′ end of the transcript. 
After RT reaction droplets are broken and cDNAs pooled and amplified using external primer designed on dT and switch oligonucleotides, respectively. Amplified 
full-length cDNA is then used as template to enrich TCR sequencing and and/or fragmented and processed to generate RNA-seq libraries. TCR enrichment is 
performed using nested PCR with a forward primer spanning the switch oligo and reverse primers designed on the constant region of alpha and beta chains. 
PCR products are then partially fragmented and sequencing adaptors are added (AD1 and AD2).

preparation drastically reducing costs and experimental 
time. The main disadvantage is that these protocols lose the 
full-length transcript coverage following cDNAs fragmentation during library preparation and have lower sensitivity 
(lower number of detectable genes) compared to full-length 
strategies. Full-length strategies are instead more expensive 
and time consuming (cDNA pool from each cell is processed 
independently to generate a single sequencing library) but are 
more sensitive and can provide a broader range of information 
concerning isoforms, splicing events, and single nucleotide 
polymorphisms. Single cell RNA-seq data generated using 
full-length approaches have been exploited to extract information about T  cell repertoire and heterogeneity. The assembly 
of full-length (TCR) sequences from scRNA-seq data allows 
for alpha and beta chain sequence pairing (not possible when 
performing “bulk” analysis) and for the integration of clonality 
information with the whole transcriptome of a single T  cell. 
This approach also presents non trivial analysis issues: the 
canonical reference-based assembly methods that rely on the 
alignment of reads to a “reference” genome are in fact biased by 
the somatic rearrangements and mutations (CDR3 is specific 
for each TCR) and the lack of a complete “reference” genome has 
required the development of de novo assembly based bioinformatic tools. All the available tools basically combine referencebased assembly (reads are aligned to annotated gene segments) 
and de novo assembly (to reconstruct the CD3 region). One 
of the first tools developed to reconstruct paired TCR alpha 
and beta chains is called TraCer (34). To validate TraCeR perfomance, Stubbington and colleagues generated single cell 
RNA-seq data using the SMART-seq protocol (Figure 2C) and 
the FluidigmC1 System (Fluidigm Corporation) isolated from 
mice spleen. In order to validate the identified clonotypes, they 
used an experimental approach to enrich TCR sequences using 
a multiplex PCR-based approach starting from the same cDNA 
used for sequencing libraries generation that was sequenced in 
parallel by NGS. A good correlation among the two strategies 
confirmed the efficiency of the approach. In the same paper, 
they applied this analysis to a mouse model of Salmonella
infection and were able to monitor the expanded clonotypes 
upon infection. The power of this approach was the association 
of TCR clonotypes to a specific gene expression profile that 
provided a detailed molecular description of the whole CD4+
T cell population and monitored the dynamics of CD4+ T cell 
subsets upon infection. This same approach was applied to 
dissect the heterogeneity of T  cell subsets to address several 
biological questions in particular related to “tumor immunity.” 
The role of T  cells in cancer has been extensively studied in 
the past few years and CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T regulatory 
cells have been broadly described to inhibit or promote tumor 
progression, respectively, in several types of cancer (35, 36). 
Recently, Zheng and colleagues used TraCer to dissect the 
landscape of T  cell infiltrating liver cancer. They analyzed 
the clonal enrichment of infiltrating Treg and CD8+ T  cells 
in order to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying 
lymphocyte recruitment in the tumor microenvironment. 
Through the dissection of the TCR repertoire they came to the 
conclusion that Treg cells do not present clonal enrichment 
in the tumor suggesting recruitment from the periphery while 
CD8+ T cells are clonally enriched suggesting clonal activation 
and expansion inside the tumor (37). Along the same lines of 
research, other tools were successively developed including 
scTCR Seq (38), TRAPes, applicable to short-reads single cell 
RNA-Seq libraries (39) and VDJ Puzzle that allows the simultaneous analysis of gene expression and TCR diversity and that 
was developed and validated on antigen-specific circulating 
CD8+ T cells (40).

NEW TECHNOLOGIES 
AND PERSPECTIVES
More recent attempts to modify tag-based strategies promise to 
couple RNA-seq and TCR sequencing from the same cells. These 
approaches have the great advantage to drastically increase the 
number of cells processed in parallel which is crucial to characterize very rare T cell populations.
A very recent publication investigated the T  cell repertoire 
in mice and human Treg cells (41). In this paper, Zemmour and 
colleagues analyzed Treg cell transcriptional phenotypes using 
different single cell RNA-seq approaches. They showed that 
Treg cells can display a broad heterogeneity with some highly 
activated subpopulation which seems transcriptionally related to 
T conventional cells. They also showed that the Treg sharing 
the same TCR were more transcriptionally similar than Treg 
with different antigen specificity providing evidence that Treg 
plasticity can be strongly influenced by TCR shaping. To analyze 
the TCR repertoire, Zemmour and colleagues used a modification of the emulsion-based InDrop protocol (Figure  2D) that 
is currently used for 3′ prime end counting (33).
In detail, cells are captured into droplets through the formation of a water-in-oil emulsion through microfluidic devices. 
Cells are captured along with lysis buffer, reagents, and specifically barcoded primer that prime RT reaction. Barcoded 
cDNAs are synthesized from thousand of cell in parallel. After 
reverse transcription cDNAs from different cells are pooled 
by breaking the droplets, linearly amplified using in  vitro
transcription and then sequencing libraries are prepared. 
As already described in this review, this pooling strategy 
exponentially increases the throughput because thousands of 
cells can be pooled in a single library. The fragmentation step, 
though, sacrifices all the information derived from the 5′ end 
of the mRNA including the CDR3 region. Zemmour and colleagues overcame this problem by introducing a TCR enrichment step after linear amplification using a multiplex RT pool 
spanning all the V alpha and beta segments. This step generates 
TCR alpha and beta libraries sharing the same barcode with 
the whole transcriptome libraries (Figure 2D). Very recently 
10x Genomics introduced a similar approach that couples 
alpha and beta chain sequencing to transcriptome analysis of 
thousands of single cells in parallel (Figure 2E). The approach 
employs a commercial emulsion-based microfluidic platform 
(Chromium 10x) that enables the generation of amplified 
cDNA used for both single cell RNA-seq libraries preparation 
and TCR target enrichment and sequencing. TCR enrichment 
is performed on amplified cDNA by PCR using reverse primers 
designed on the constant regions of alpha and beta chains and 
a universal forward primer designed on an oligonucleotide 
sequence added at the 5′ through a template-switch mechanism during the second strand synthesis. Each oligonucleotide 
contains a unique cell barcode to tag the whole transcriptome 
of a cell, including TCR transcripts.
CONCLUSION
T  cell receptor repertoire analysis has become a fundamental 
tool to understand the biology of T cells in healthy individuals 
and in several pathological conditions and is currently applied 
not only to study the biology of immune-mediated diseases but 
also to monitor the immune responses to therapies. Pioneering 
techniques such as CD3 spectratyping had been extensively 
exploited to provide information on clonal expansion but the 
real revolution in terms of throughput and applications was 
introduced by the development of NGS techniques. Sequencing 
the TCR of thousands of cells in parallel is a powerful instrument 
to dissect the complexity and diversity of the T  cell response 
repertoire. The main limit of this technology relies in the impossibility to pair alpha and beta sequencing which impairs our 
understanding of what happens in vivo. This critical issue has 
been recently overcome with the fast development and expansion 
of single cell technologies that provide sequence information on 
paired alpha and beta chains of individual cells. A further level 
of complexity derives by the efforts to associate TCR repertoire 
and gene expression profile from the same cells. This kind of 
analysis provides an unbiased classification of a population of 
interest and the association of the transcriptional landscape of 
each cell with its TCR. This approach promises to open new 
avenues to describe the specific clonality of immune cell subsets 
even of the poorly characterized phenotypic subtypes and gives 
the opportunity to monitor the effect of transcriptional dynamics in strict association to clonality.
