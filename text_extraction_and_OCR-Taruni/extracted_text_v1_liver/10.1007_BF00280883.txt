Summary. The steady-state basal plasma glucose and insulin 
concentrations are determined by their interaction in a feedback loop. A computer-solved model has been used to predict 
the homeostatic concentrations which arise from Varying degrees of/3-cell deficiency and insulin resistance. Comparison 
of a patient's fasting values with the model's predictions allows a quantitative assessment of the contributions of insulin 
resistance and deficient r-cell function to the fasting hyperglycaemia (homeostasis model assessment, HOMA). The accuracy and precision of the estimate have been determined by 
comparison with independent measures of insulin resistance 
and /3-cell function using hyperglycaemic and euglycaemic 
clamps and an intravenous glucose tolerance test. The estimate of insulin resistance obtained by homeostasis model assessment correlated with estimates obtained by use of the euglycaemic clamp (R~=0.88, p<0.0001), the fasting insulin 
concentration (P~ = 0.81, p < 0.0001), and the hyperglycaemic 
clamp, (Rs=0.69,p< 0.01). There was no correlation with any 
aspect of insulin-receptor binding. The estimate of deficient/3- 
cell function obtained by homeostasis model assessment 
correlated with that derived using the hyperglycaemic clamp 
(R~ = 0.61, p< 0.01) and with the estimate from the intravenous glucose tolerance test (R~ = 0.64, p < 0.05). The low precision of the estimates from the model (coefficients of variation: 
31% for insulin resistance and 32% for/3-cell deficit) limits its 
use, but the correlation of the model's estimates with patient 
data accords with the hypothesis that basal glucose and insulin interactions are largely determined by a simple feed back 
loop. 
Key words: r-cell function, insulin resistance, mathematical 
model, intravenous glucose tolerance test, glucose clamp, insulin receptors, Type 2 diabetes, insulin, glucose. 
The fasting plasma glucose and insulin concentrations 
in each normal subject or Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetic patient are set at a level characteristic for 
that individual for a given state of nutrition [1, 2]. The 
fasting plasma insulin concentration is largely determined by the glucose concentration [3] and the basal hyperglycaemia in diabetes appears to arise from the feedback loop between the liver and/3-cells, thereby maintaining an effective insulin action in the liver and at the 
periphery [1, 4]. The degree of basal hyperglycaemia is 
thus determined by a combination of/3-cell deficiency 
and insulin resistance. A mathematical model of the 
glucose: insulin interactions has been used to indicate 
the degree to which they combine to give hyperglycaemia with low, normal or raised basal plasma insulin 
concentrations [5, 6]. The predictions from the model 
are in accord with known data in man [5]. A formal test 
has now been undertaken of the degree to which insulin 
resistance and deficient r-cell function can be assessed 
from a patient's fasting plasma insulin and glucose concentrations. We term this interpretation of the 'set' of a 
feedback loop "homeostasis model assessment" (HOMA). 
A computer-solved model of insulin: glucose interactions has been used to plot an array of fasting plasma 
insulin and glucose concentrations that would be expected for varying degrees of/3-cell deficiency and insulin resistance. From the array one can estimate the insulin resistance and deficient/3-cell function which might 
have been expected to give the fasting plasma glucose 
and insulin concentrations observed in a patient. These 
HOMA estimates have been compared with independent estimates of/3-cell function and insulin resistance. 
The additional estimates of/3-cell function were derived 
from responses to (1) a hyperglycaemic clamp [7], and 
(2) an intravenous glucose tolerance test. Insulin resistance was independently assessed using (1) an euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp [7], (2) an hyperglycaemic 
clamp, (3) the degree of obesity, (4) the fasting plasma 
insulin levels alone, and (5) monocyte and erythrocyte

model predictions for the basal or

the model prediction of the 
steady-state plasma glucose and 
insulin concentrations for a series of 
different B-cell functions (--) and

any individual, fasting observations of 
plasma glucose and insulin may be 
entered on the grid and the estimated 
r-cell function and insulin resistance 
obtained 
insulin receptor status [8]. Both insulin resistance and rcell function estimates have been compared with those 
obtained after continuous infusion of glucose with 
mode[ assessment (CIGMA) [9]. 
Methods 
Subjects and procedures 
Diabetic subjects satisfied World Health Organisation criteria [10] at 
the time of presentation, were then treated by diet and, at the time of 
study, none had glycosuria. The studies were approved by the Oxford 
Health Authority Ethics Committee and all subjects gave their informed consent. 
Homeostasis model analysis (HOMA). The computer model of fasting 
or basal insulin: glucose interaction has been described previously [5, 
6, 9]. The /3-cell curve is based on near-steady-state C-peptide responses to 2.5-h hyperglycaemic clamps at plasma glucose concentrations of 7.5, 10 and 15 mmol/l in six normal subjects aged 40-68 years 
[11]. They had a nearly linear glucose: C-peptide dose-response curve 
with an intercept on the glucose axis of 3.5 mmol/l (Fig. 1). Five maturity-onset diabetic patients treated by diet alone and with a fasting 
plasma glucose 5.5-6.5 mmol/1, had a similar intercept with reduced 
slope. The plasma glucose:insulin response for normal subjects, 
equivalent to the C-peptide response, is insulin = 5 (glucose-3.5). With 
this steady-state measure of r-cell function, the model allows assessment of the basal, steady state plasma glucose and insulin levels 
which are appropriate for different degrees of r-cell dysfunction and 
insulin resistance (Fig. 1). Any combination of insulin resistance and 
r-cell deficit provides a unique set of plasma insulin and glucose concentrations. The deficient r-cell function and insulin resistance can 
thus be read offthis graph or obtained from a numerical array of plasma insulin and glucose concentrations. Assuming that normal-weight 
normal subjects aged < 35 years have 100% r-cell function, and an insulin resistance of 1, the values for a patient can be assessed from the 
insulin and glucose concentrations by the formulae: r-cell function 
(%)=20xinsulin/(glucose-3.5), and (near approximation) resistance = insulin/(22.5e-lngtu~~ 
Comparison of insulin resistance and r-cell function estimates by HOMA with estimates from intravenous glucose tolerance test and insulin 
receptor studies. Six normal male subjects (aged 23-67 years) and six 
Type 2 diabetic men (aged 46-68 years) were studied on three separate 
occasions in random order. Their details have been reported elsewhere [9]. On one occasion, they were admitted at 20.00 h to a metabolic ward, and a double lumen 21 G Teflon catheter (Venflon, Viggo, 
Helsingborg, Sweden) was placed under local anaesthesia into a distal 
forearm vein warmed to enhance flow. Heparin was infused through 
the outer lumen at 88 of the blood extraction rate. Blood samples 
were taken continuously (integrated sampling) [12] from the central 
lumen by a rotary pump (Watson-Marlow, Bucks, UK) into a fraction 
collector (Redirac, LKB, Bromma, Sweden), which moved forward 
each 15 rain to collect samples for overnight basal plasma insulin and 
glucose concentrations in sleeping subjects. At 08.00 hours the next 
morning, 110 ml of blood were taken for monocyte and erythrocyte 
insulin-receptor assay. The integrated sampling rate was increased to 
one fraction per minute, and glucose (0.2 g/kg ideal body weight) [13] 
was then given over 2 min through a separate cannula in an antecubital vein. The mean plasma insulin concentration between 10 and 30 
min after the glucose bolus was used as a measure of r-cell function. 
On two other mornings the patients attended hospital for tests. On 
one a euglycaemic clamp was performed and on the other a CIGMA 
test was done (vide infra) [9]. 
Samples taken at 0300 0500 h were designated 'overnight basal', 
samples taken between 06.30 and 07.30 h after the overnight study 
were designated 'basal', and samples taken when the subject came to 
the hospital in the morning for either the CIGMA or the clamp were 
termed 'stressed fasting' [2]. 
Comparison of insulin resistance measured by HOMA with the estimate 
by euglycaemic clamp. Twelve normal subjects (aged 23-67years, 
90-142% ideal body weight), and 11 Type 2 diabetic patients (aged 
46-68 years, 100-176% ideal body weight) were studied as reported 
previously [9] by the euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp technique 
[9, 14]. Insulin resistance was assessed using the glucose infusion rate 
over the last 20 rain, expressed relative to the median of values 
(0.59 g/rain for a 70 kg subject) from normal-weight normal subjects 
which was designated as 1.

Insulin resistance: hypergtycaemic clamp 
Fig.2h and B. Measures of relative insulin resistance by HOMA 
compared with those assessed by A euglycaemic clamp, and B hyperglycaemic clamp in two separate groups of normal (O) and diabetic 
9 subjects. The insulin resistance values for the clamps have been 
normalised to unity for the median of normal weight, normal subjects 
aged < 35 years [9] 
Type 2 diabetic patients came to the hospital fasting on a separate day 
for a continuous infusion of a 10 g/dl solution of glucose at a dose of 
5 mg/kg ideal body weight per min [9]. HOMA was assessed from the 
15 min 'stressed fasting' samples before the glucose infusion. 
Comparison of fl-cell function and insulin resistance measured by HOMA and the hyperglycaemie damp. Ten normal subjects (aged 
22-69 years, 90-113 % ideal body weight) and 11 Type 2 diabetic subjects treated by diet alone (aged 40-69years, 97-174% ideal body 
weight) were studied. Their details have been reported elsewhere [9]. 
A hyperglycaemic clamp at 10mmol/1 was performed on patients 
who came fasting in the morning [7, 14]. ]?-cell function was assessed 
by reference to the plasma insulin concentration achieved in the last 
20 min of a 2.5-h hyperglycaemic clamp, expressed as percent of the 
median of the values (33 mU/1) for normal weight, normal subjects 
[9]. Insulin resistance was assessed by the glucose clearance relative to 
achieved plasma insulin [9], expressed as a ratio to the median of values for normal subjects: 0.18 x[mean plasma insulin mU.l-a]/[mg 
glucose infused/kg body weight per min]. HOMA was assessed from 
the 15min 'stressed fasting' samples before the hyperglycaemic 
clamp. 
Reproducibility studies. Nine normal subjects (aged 22-29years, 
96-107% ideal body weight), and nine Type 2 diabetic subjects on diet 
only (aged 46-68years, 106-188% ideal body weight) were studied 
with a CIGMA on two separate occasions within 3 weeks. Clinical details of the diabetic patients are given in Table 1. 
HOMA was performed on two separate occasions in each of the 
11 diabetic and 10 normal subjects who attended from home on one 
morning for a hyperglycaemic clamp and on another for CIGMA. On 
both occasions, the HOMA was based on observations during the last 
15 min of the 30-min pre-infusion sampling period. 
Laboratory analyses 
Plasma insulin and glucose assays have been described previously [9]. 
The values for different tests were measured in separate assays. 
The erythrocyte separation and monocyte receptor assays were 
carried out using a modified method of Gambhir et al. [15] previously 
described [16]. The monocytes were checked for viability using Trypan 
Blue (for all suspensions viability > 95%). Monocytes were identified 
by non-specific esterase staining. The percentage of monocytes 
ranged from 12% to 28%, the other cells being almost exclusively lymphocytes identified by Leishman's stain. The same mono-iodinated 
125I [A-14] insulin was used on each of the occasions for each subject. 
Selection of samples for HOMA 
In general, the fasting plasma glucose and insulin observations used 
for HOMA were obtained on the same day as the independent clamp 
or intravenous glucose tolerance tests with which the HOMA results 
were compared. On euglycaemic clamp days, a single fasting plasma 
samples was used, but otherwise the 'fasting' plasma insulin and glucose concentrations were the means of the results on the last 15 of 30 
samples taken at 1-min intervals before the test. This period was chosen in view of the 14-min cycles of plasma insulin secretion known to 
occur in normal man [17]. 
Statistical methods 
Correlations were assessed by a non-parametric test (Spearman, R~). 
Coefficient of variation was assessed by the formula for duplicates:

Results 
Comparisons of methods of assessing insulin resistance 
HOMA compared with the euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp. The HOMA estimate of insulin resistance 
correlated with that measured by the euglycaemic 
clamp in the 12 normal subjects (P~=0.83, p<0.01), in 
the 11 diabetic subjects (P~=0.92, p<0.0001) and in 
both groups together (P~ 0.88, p<0.0001; Fig.2). The 
median insulin resistance in normal subjects was 1.21 as 
assessed by HOMA and 1.45 by euglycaemic clamp, 
while in diabetic subjects it was 2.89 by HOMA and 4.1 
by euglycaemic clamp. The single 'stressed fasting' plasma insulin values alone gave similar correlations with 
the euglycaemic clamp estimate of resistance (R~ = 0.81, 
p< 0.0001) and with the estimate by HOMA (R~ = 0.93, 
p < 0.0001). 
HOMA compared with the hyperglycaemic clamp. The 
HOMA estimate of insulin resistance from the mean of 
15 'stressed fasting' samples before the clamp correlated 
with that measured by the hyperglycaemic clamp in the 
10 normal subjects (R~ = 0.55, p < 0A), in the 11 diabetic 
subjects (R~ 0.68, p= 0.02) and in both groups together 
(R~ = 0.69, p= 0.0005, Fig. 2). The median insulin resistance for normal subjects was 1.45 as assessed by HOMA and 0.97 by hyperglycaemic clamp; for diabetic 
subjects it was 2.61 by HOMA and 1.1 by the clamp. 
HOMA compared with CIGMA. The HOMA estimate 
of insulin resistance from the mean of 15 stressed fasting samples before the CIGMA correlated with that 
measured by CIGMA in 11 normal subjects (R~ = 0.69, 
p < 0.02), in 12 diabetic subjects (R~ 0.97, p < 0.0001) and 
in both groups together (Rs = 0.87, p < 0.0001). The median resistance for normal subjects was 1.21 by HOMA 
and 1.35 by CIGMA, and for the diabetic subjects 2.89 
by HOMA and 3.9 by CIGMA. 
Comparisons with monocyte and erythrocyte insulin receptor binding data. The insulin receptor binding data 
from erythrocytes and monocytes were analysed in 
terms of insulin binding with no added insulin and 
binding at increasing concentrations of insulin. The data were analysed by both Scatchard and negative cooperativity theories. Neither receptor numbers or any 
aspect of high or low affinity binding correlated with 
other measures of insulin resistance (HOMA, clamp, 
basal insulin or CIGMA: ~ all < 0.55; NS). 
Reproducibility of estimates of insulin resistance by 
HOMA 
The coefficient of variation of the HOMA estimates of 
resistance was 40% from the 2 days on which the nine 
normal subjects had repeat glucose infusions, 30% for 
the corresponding values in the nine diabetic subjects, 
and 34% for all subjects combined.

Clamp = euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp; HG clamp = hyperglycaemic damp; IVGTr=intravenous glucose tolerance test. The 
hyperglycaemic clamp data are from ]0 normal and 11 diabetic subjects. Each line represents a Spearman rank correlation coefficient of 
0.1 units (thus 5 lines indicate R~ = 0.5); -- =p < 0.05, - ..... p > 0.05 
The coefficient of variation of the HOMA estimates 
of resistance on the 2 days that the 11 diabetic and 10 
normal subjects had CIGMA and hyperglycaemic 
clamps, was 32% in normal subjects, 23% in diabetic 
subjects, and 27% overall. The mean coefficient of variation over the two studies was 31%. 
Insulin resistance assessed from a single sample or three 
samples over 10 min 
The data from the samples were analysed to establish 
whether observations on a single 'stressed fasting' sample, or the means of observations on samples taken over 
15 min, were better for HOMA analysis. The results 
from the six normal and six diabetic subjects who were 
studied on three separate occasions were analysed 
(Table 2). HOMA estimates of insulin resistance from 
the single 'stressed fasting' sample before the euglycaemic clamp correlated better with the euglycaemic clamp 
estimate of resistance on the same day (R~ 0.77, p< 
0.005) than did the values from the mean of the 15-min 
values (on a different day) before the CIGMA (R~ 0.62, 
p< 0.04). The median HOMA values for the normal 
subjects on the single sample and 15-min samples were 
1.96 and 1.35, respectively, and those for diabetic subjects were 2.42 and 2.39, respectively. Not all 15-min 
samples needed to be analysed: the resistance estimate 
by HOMA using the mean of results of three samples at 
0, 5 and 10 min was correlated with the estimate from 
HOMA using the mean of results on 15 consecutive 
l-min samples (R~ 0.98, p<0.0001), and accordingly 
was also correlated with resistance estimated by euglycaemic clamp (R, 0.70, p < 0.021). 
Similar comparisons of sampling were done with 
the 15 consecutive 1-min samples before the CIGMA 
infusion in the 12 diabetic and 11 normal subjects who 
had an euglycaemic clamp. The resistance values from 
the mean of results from the 15 consecutive 1-min samples and from the mean of results from samples at times 
0, 5 and a0min were correlated with the euglycaemic 
clamp resistance estimates (P~=0.89 and 0.88 respectively; p < 0.0001). 
In the study of repeat glucose infusions in nine normal and nine diabetic subjects, the coefficient of variation was similar whether mean results from multiple 
samples (34%) or single plasma samples (30%) were 
used. 
Insulin resistance assessed from 'overnight basal'samples 
or from 'stressed fasting'samples 
Insulin resistance by HOMA from 'overnight basal' 
(03.00-05.00 h) samples in the six normal and six diabetic subjects correlated with the 'basal' (06.30-07.30 h) 
value on the same day (R~ = 0.90, p< 0.0001, Table 2), 
and with the HOMA results on the mean observations 
from 'stressed fasting' samples 0, 5 and 10 min before 
the CIGMA test on a different day (R~ 0.70, p= 0.011). 

D. R. Matthews et al.: Homeostasis model assessment 417 
There was no quantitative difference between the overnight basal samples and the morning basal values in respect of the insulin resistance measured by HOMA (medians: normal subjects 1.3, 2.0 respectively, diabetic 
subjects 2.5, 2.8, respectively). These values were similar 
to those obtained by HOMA on the euglycaemic clamp 
day (median: normal subjects 1.96, diabetic subjects 
2.4). 
Comparisons of methods of assessing ~3-cell function 
HOMA compared with hyperglycaemic clamp. The HOMA estimate of/3-cell function assessed from a 15-min 
period of sampling correlated with that measured by the 
hyperglycaemic clamp in 10 normal subjects alone 
(1%=0.59, p<0.05), in 11 diabetic subjects alone 
(1%=0.71, p<0.02) and in both groups together (1% 
0.61, p < 0.01 : Fig. 3). The median/3-cell function values 
were 115% by HOMA and 100% by hyperglycaemic 
clamp for normal subjects, and 80% by HOMA and 
69% by hyperglycaemic clamp for diabetic subjects. 
HOMA compared with intravenous glucose tolerance test. 
/3-cell function assessed from the plasma insulin levels 
during the intravenous glucose tolerance test correlated 
with the HOMA estimates of/3-cell function assessed 
from the basal period on the same day (in normal subjects: 1%=0.54, NS; in diabetic subjects: 1%=0.77, p< 
0.01 ; and in both groups together: 1% = 0.64, p< 0.05; 
Fig. 3). The median values of the estimates of/3-cell 
function by HOMA for normal and diabetic subjects 
were 101% and 45%, respectively. 
HOMA compared with CIGMA. The CIGMA estimates 
of/3-cell function correlated significantly with the HOMA estimates from samples taken over a 15-rain period 
on the same day in normal subjects (1% = 0.73, p< 0.01), 
in diabetic subjects (1%=0.7, p<0.01) and in both 
groups of subjects together (1% = 0.90, p< 0.0001). The 
median values for/3-cell function were 113 % by HOMA 
and 92% by CIGMA in normal subjects and 68% by 
HOMA and 52% by CIGMA in diabetic subjects. 
Reproducibility of estimate of /3-cell function by HOMA 
The coefficients of variation of the paired estimates of 
/3-cell function by HOMA performed before glucose infusions were 38% in nine normal subjects, 33% in nine 
diabetic subjects, and 35% in all subjects. 
The coefficients of variation of the paired estimates 
of/3-cell function by HOMA performed before CIGMA 
and hyperglycaemic clamps were 30% in normal subjects, 27% in diabetic subjects and 29% in all subjects. 
The mean coefficient of variation over the two studies 
was 32%. 
~3-cell function assessed from either a single sample or 
three samples over 10 min 
The data from the samples were analysed to establish 
whether a single 'stressed fasting' observation or the 
mean of data taken over 15 min was better for HOMA 
analysis. The results from the 10 normal and 11 diabetic 
subjects who had a hyperglycaemic clamp were analysed. The HOMA estimate of/3-cell function from the 
single "stressed fasting' sample before the hyperglycaemic clamp correlated with the corresponding clamp estimate of/3-cell function, whether a single sample (1% 
0.57, p = 0.007) or whether the values from the mean of 
the 15 consecutive 1-min values on the same day were 
used (1% 0.61, p= 0.003). The median values based on 
the single sample in the normal and the diabetic subjects were 115% and 80%, respectively. 
In the study of repeat glucose infusions in nine normal and nine diabetic subjects, the coefficient of variation between the HOMA estimates of/3-cell function 
was smaller when using the mean of 0, 5 and 10-min 
samples to estimate function (coefficient of variation 
35%) than when using 'stressed fasting' samples (coefficient of variation 52%). 
fl-cell function assessed from overnight basal 'samples' or 
from 'stressed fasting samples' 
HOMA estimates of fl-cell function from 'overnight 
basal' (03.00-05.00hours) samples in the six normal 
and six diabetic subjects correlated with those from the 
'basal' (06.30-07.30h) samples on the same day 
(1% = 0.78, p= 0.026, Table 2), and with those from the 
mean 0, 5 and 10 min 'stressed fasting' results before the 
CIGMA test on the different day (1% 0.64, p = 0.026). 
Median values of the HOMA estimates from 'overnight basal' and 'morning basal' samples were, respectively, 150% and 162% in normal, and 117% and 101% 
in diabetic subjects. These values differed quantitatively 
from those obtained using 'stressed fasting' samples before intravenous glucose tolerance test (101% in normal 
and 45% in diabetic subjects). 
Discussion 
The simplest aspect of the glucose and insulin homeostatic feed-back loop is in the basal state [18]. The basal 
hyperglycaemia of diabetes may be considered as a 
compensatory response with a major r61e in maintaining sufficient insulin secretion, from a reduced fl-cell capacity, to control hepatic glucose effiux [1, 4]. We have 
investigated this with a model of the interactions between insulin and glucose, based on available data on/3- 
cell, hepatic and peripheral responses [5, 6, 9]. For any 
combination of insulin resistance and p-cell function, 
the model predicts unique values for basal glucose and 
insulin concentrations. The whole array may be repre-

sented graphically (Fig. a); observations from an individual patient can be plotted and the predicted values 
for insulin resistance and/3-cell function may be obtained from the graph. 
This use of modelling to provide a reference graph 
contrasts with other models where an individual patient's data have to be entered into a computer to determine the relationships between rapidly changing variables, such as occur after an intravenous glucose test 
[a91. 
In principle, the HOMA of fasting insulin and glucose levels should be able to differentiate/3-cell deficit 
from insulin resistance without any of the problems of 
using an artificial stimulus. In practice, however, the estimation of the set of a patient's feed-back loop from 
fasting insulin values by HOMA is unlikely to be precise. The range over which insulin is measured is small 
and the results depend on the precision of the insulin 
radioimmunoassay. The pulsatility of insulin secretion 
[a7], uncertainty whether proinsulin is being measured 
as insulin [20], and the effects of stress [2] or exercise [21] 
could affect interpretation of assay results. 
The fasting insulin concentration and HOMA assessment of insulin resistance correlated with other estimates of insulin resistance. This is not surprising in view 
of the manner in which the feed-back loop is bound to 
increase the basal plasma insulin level to overcome hepatic insulin resistance [5, 6]. In this study, the assessment by HOMA correlated with the resistance assessed 
by fasting plasma insulin alone, but the diabetic patients studied did not have marked hyperglycaemia and 
Figure a shows, under these circumstances, that the insulin concentration is a simple function of insulin resistance. 
Overnight basal plasma glucose concentrations are 
slightly lower than on stressed fasting samples when the 
patient has been up [2]. HOMA provides reasonable estimates of insulin resistance in all fasting samples, but 
better estimates of/3-cell function on stressed fasting 
than overnight basal samples. HOMA assessment of/3- 
cell function is not as good for normal as for diabetic 
subjects, partly because of the proximity of different/~- 
cell function lines at normal glucose concentrations 
(Fig.a) and partly because younger normal subjects 
have a sigmoid rather than the linear/3-cell steady-state 
glucose: C-peptide response curve used in the model 
[aa]. In addition, the basal plasma glucose concentration in normal subjects depends on the 'set' of the sensitivity of their/3-cells at slightly different fasting plasma 
glucose concentrations rather than on quantitative differences in maximal/3-cell function [2a]. Nevertheless, 
HOMA results correlate with other measures of/3-cell 
function and insulin resistance, and a graphical summary of correlations between different measures is 
shown in Figure 4. The degree of the hyperglycaemia 
does not correlate significantly with either the degrees 
of abnormal fl-cell function or insulin resistance. This is 
not surprising in that the hyperglycaemia results from a 
combination of these two factors, rather than from either alone. 
It is necessary to measure the fasting plasma insulin 
over a 15-min period, in subjects who are rested, to 
avoid the confounding effects of oscillatory release [17] 
and stress [2]. A single fasting sample taken in the outpatient clinic is unlikely to be a reliable guide to a subject's insulin resistance or fl-cell function. If HOMA is 
undertaken, there are advantages in precision to be 
gained from sampling at three separate intervals 5 min 
apart. Even then, the high coefficient of variation of 
measurement of either/3-cell function or insulin resistance on different days (30%), makes HOMA less reliable than CIGMA. One advantage of CIGMA is that 
the infused glucose "expands the scale" over which the 
same homeostatic responses occur, and thus enables 
more precise assessment. 
Although the imprecision limits the clinical application of HOMA estimates from a single blood sample, 
the significant correlations of HOMA estimates with independent measurements of/3-cell function and insulin 
resistance support the theoretical background of the 
analysis. Thus, the fasting plasma insulin and glucose 
concentrations found in normal and diabetic subjects 
were similar to those which the mathematical model 
predicted, given the insulin resistance and fl-cell function as measured by other tests. Whilst this does not exclude many factors having an influence on the basal 
concentrations it accords with a major rrle for the simple interaction of plasma glucose and insulin between 
the liver,/3-cells and periphery.
