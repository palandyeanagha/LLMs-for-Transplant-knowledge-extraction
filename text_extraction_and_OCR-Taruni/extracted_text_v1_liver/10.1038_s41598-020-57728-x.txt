Increased concentrations of the vasodilator histamine have been observed in patients undergoing 
abdominal surgery. The role of histamine during orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) has only been 
studied in animals. The aim of this study was to measure plasma concentrations of histamine and its 
degrading enzyme diamine oxidase (DAO) in patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation, 
and assess whether histamine or DAO correlate with intraoperative noradrenaline requirements. 
Histamine and DAO concentrations were measured in 22 adults undergoing liver transplantation 
and 22 healthy adults. Furthermore, norepinephrine requirements during liver transplantation were 
recorded. Baseline concentrations of histamine and DAO were greater in patients, who underwent liver 
transplantation, than in healthy individuals (Histamine: 6.4nM, IQR[2.9–11.7] versus 4.3nM, IQR[3.7–
7.1], p=0.029; DAO: 2.0ng/mL, IQR[1.5–4.1] versus <0,5ng/mL, IQR[<0.5–1.1], p<0.001). During 
liver transplantation, histamine concentrations decreased to 1.8nM, IQR[0.5–4.9] in the anhepatic 
phase (p<0.0001 versus baseline), and to 1.5nM, IQR[0.5–2.9] after reperfusion (p<0.0001 versus 
baseline). In contrast, DAO concentrations increased to 35.5ng/ml, IQR[20–50] in the anhepatic phase 
(p=0.001 versus baseline) and to 39.5ng/ml, IQR[23–64] after reperfusion (p=0.001 versus baseline), 
correlating inversely with histamine. Norepinephrine requirements during human liver transplantation 
correlated signifcantly with DAO concentrations in the anhepatic phase (r=0.58, p=0.011) and after 
reperfusion (r=0.56; p=0.022). In patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation, histamine 
concentrations decrease whereas DAO concentrations increase manifold. Diamine oxidase correlates 
with intraoperative norepinephrine requirements in patients undergoing OLT.
Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is the only curative procedure for end-stage liver disease (ESLD). Patients with 
ESLD usually present with a systemic hyperdynamic cardiovascular regulation, demonstrating an increased cardiac 
output, reduced systemic vascular resistance and impaired vascular responsiveness to stress. During OLT, patients 
are exposed to further major hemodynamic alterations primarily due to temporary caval clamping, blood loss and 
ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Temporary clamping of the inferior vena cava decreases cardiac output by approximately 50% due to a reduction in venous return to the heart1,2
, while blood loss leads to hypovolemia. I/R injury, 
mainly characterized by oxidative damage and a severe infammatory response, triggers the secretion of vasoactive 
mediators into the recipients’ systemic circulation3
. Tus, OLT is frequently associated with hemodynamic instability 
of the recipient presenting clinically with hypotension, increased vasopressor support and cardiac arrhythmias.

Histamine is stored primarily in basophils and mast cells, and its release is triggered by various antigens, 
cytokines and drugs, but also by hypoxia and I/R4
. When released, histamine exerts pleiotropic physiological and 
pathophysiological regulatory functions, mainly inducing systemic vasodilation and increasing capillary permeability3
. Experimental studies have demonstrated that histamine concentrations increase in pigs undergoing OLT5. 
In clinical studies, increased plasma histamine concentrations have been observed in patients with cirrhosis6
and 
in patients undergoing abdominal surgeries7
. However, no human studies have assessed histamine concentrations 
in patients undergoing OLT.
Balance between release and clearance of histamine is of utmost importance for hemodynamic stability in 
humans. In order to prevent or minimize an overshooting systemic vasoactive response to histamine, the body 
is equipped with various defense mechanisms to tightly control the plasma histamine concentrations6
. Excessive 
enteral and likely renal re-absorption of histamine are prevented by the constitutive expression of the histamine 
metabolizing enzyme diamine oxidase (DAO)8
. Furthermore, the liver is a major organ responsible for clearing 
excessive histamine from the circulation9
.
During OLT patients are exposed to an anhepatic period. We hypothesized that in patients undergoing OLT 
the anhepatic phase induces a dysbalance between release and clearance of histamine, contributing to systemic 
hypotension during OLT. Tus, the aim of this study was to measure concentrations of histamine and its degrading enzyme DAO in patients undergoing OLT, and to correlate histamine and DAO concentrations with the 
intra-operative noradrenaline requirements.
Materials and Methods
Study subjects. Tis single-center, observational study was performed in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki. Institutional ethics committee (Medical University of Vienna) 
approval for the study was obtained. Written informed consent was obtained before enrollment into the study.
Twenty-two adult patients scheduled for OLT at the General Hospital of Vienna between August 2014 and 
August 2015 were enrolled in the study. Exclusion criteria were combined liver-kidney or liver-lung transplantation, and the need of intraoperative veno-venous bypass10. To allow direct comparison between patients with 
ESLD and healthy individuals, blood samples were additionally obtained form twenty-two healthy age-matched 
adult volunteers.
Anesthesia, surgery, and immunosuppression. Anesthesia and surgery were performed according to 
the local standards, which have already been previously described by our research group10,11. Te surgical technique was performed pursuant to the local standard technique with cross clamping of the inferior caval vein. All 
grafs were ABO compatible and matched for the graf-to-recipient-weight ratio. Immunosuppression was initiated already intraoperatively, before graf reperfusion, and continued according to the local standardized protocol 
for immunosuppression in OLT.
Data and sample collection. Demographic data, primary disease leading to ESLD, the model of end-stage 
liver disease (MELD) score, surgical reports, the anesthetic report, as well as relevant parameters from the postoperative course on the intensive care unit, including the use of blood and coagulation products were collected 
for each patient. Diagnosis of clinically signifcant portal hypertension was established in patients sufering from 
ESLD fulflling one or more of the following: hepatic vein pressure gradient >10 mmHg, gastroenteral varices, 
liver stifness measurement or imaging showing collateral circulation12,13.
Results from routinely daily measured laboratory parameters were extracted from the patient data management sofware (PDMS, Phillips, USA). Te maximal norepinephrine infusion rate and the total amount of infused 
norepinephrine during OLT were recorded. In patients scheduled for OLT, blood samples were drawn from an 
arterial line, which is placed standardly during OLT. Arterial blood samples were collected at the following 
pre-defned time points (TP): at baseline (BL) prior to surgery, during OLT in the anhepatic phase immediately 
prior to reperfusion (TP1) and 10minutes afer graf - reperfusion (TP2). Control blood samples were obtained in 
the morning from the radial artery of fasting adult volunteers. Immediately afer collection, plasma samples were 
centrifuged at 2600 g for 20minutes and stored at −80 °C until analysis.
Sample analysis. Histamine concentrations in plasma were measured using a commercially available 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Immunotech, Beckmann Coulter Company, Brea, CA) on a 
standard curve ranging from 1–90nM.
Diamine oxidase concentrations were measured using a custom-assembled ELISA as described recently14
using recombinant human diamine oxidase as a standard15. Briefy, a purifed monoclonal antibody raised against 
human DAO isolated from Caco-2 cell supernatant was coated at 5 µg/ml onto white high protein binding microtiter plates (Greiner bio-one 655074) in 50mM carbonate-bicarbonate coating bufer pH 9.6 overnight at 4 °C. 
EDTA plasma was diluted 1 to 5 with LowCross-Buffer (CANDOR bioscience 1000500; Germany). Bound 
human DAO was detected with an anti-DAO polyclonal rabbit IgG serum fraction diluted 1 to 1000. Te bound 
rabbit antibodies were detected with a 1 to 32000 dilution of donkey anti-rabbit IgG HRP-labelled antibodies 
(Sigma SAB3700928; Austria). Antibodies were incubated for 50minutes at room temperature. Bound HRP molecules were quantifed with the SuperSignal™ ELISA Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Termo Scientifc 37070; 
Vienna) using a standard chemiluminescent reader (Victor2TM 1420 Microtiter Plate Reader (Perkin Elmer). Te 
limit of blank (LOB) and detection (LOD) are 0.27 and 0.48ng/ml respectively using 42 standard curve determinations. Te estimate limit of quantifcation (eLOQ) is 0.70ng/ml. A value of 0.48ng/mL was assigned for values 
below the detection limit for conservative statistical comparisons.
Mast cell degranulation triggered by anaphylactic reactions is a frequent cause for histamine release into 
patient’s systemic circulation16, but may also be associated with DAO release17. To exclude possible intraoperative

mast cell degranulation as a potential cause for histamine release in our patients, total tryptase concentrations 
were measured in plasma of patients undergoing OLT (ImmunoCAP Tryptase ELISA Kit, Termoscientifc, 
Waltham, MA).
Diamine oxidase release is triggered by heparin18. To determine whether endogenous hepariniziation could 
explain a possible DAO release, we measured aPTT and anti-FXa activities in a subgroup of patients, and performed a thrombelastometric analysis calculating the diference between measurements with and without heparinase (INTEM – HEPTEM).
Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were performed using Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Sofware, La Jolla, 
CA) and Statistica, (Stat Sof Inc., Tulsa, OK). Results are depicted as median with interquartile ranges (IQR, 
[25–75%], unless indicated otherwise. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to verify normal distribution. A 
Friedman analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by post-hoc Wilcoxon tests, and U-tests were applied for 
comparison between groups. Correlations were calculated by the Spearman ranks correlation analysis. Receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to assess the diagnostic value of plasma histamine and DAO concentrations to discriminate the need for higher dosage of vasopressor support with norepinephrine (≥0.3mcg/kg/
min) during the anhepatic phase and reperfusion period. Statistical signifcance was set at p<0.05.
Sample size calculation. Previous studies assessed plasma histamine concentrations in healthy volunteers19, and compared histamine concentrations between cirrhotic patients and healthy individuals20. Based on 
these data we estimated an intra- and inter-subject coefcient of variation of plasma histamine concentrations 
of approximately 60% and 90%, respectively. We calculated that 19 subjects in each group would be sufcient to 
allow detection of a 2-fold greater histamine concentration in patients undergoing OLT with 80% power and an 
alpha error of <5%. We felt that this efect size is clinically justifed because plasma histamine concentrations 
greater than 2-fold the upper normal limit of 11nM might be hemodynamically relevant as demonstrated by a 
30% increase in the heart rate in healthy volunteers3
.
Ethics declaration. Approval was obtained from the local ethics committee of the Medical University of 
Vienna. Patients informed consent was obtained before enrollment in the study.
Results

measured afer reperfusion were lower in patients undergoing OLT than histamine concentrations of healthy 
volunteers at BL. Neither the amount and type of fuids, nor the number of blood products administered during 
transplantation correlated with plasma histamine concentrations.
Perioperative plasma DAO concentrations. In patients scheduled for OLT, baseline plasma DAO concentrations were signifcantly greater (2.0 ng/mL, IQR [1.5–4.1]) than in age-matched controls (<0.50 ng/mL, 
IQR [<0.5 to 1.1]; p<0.001). In patients undergoing OLT, DAO concentrations increased to 35.5 ng/mL, IQR 
[20–50] in the anhepatic phase (p=0.001 versus baseline), and to 39.5ng/mL, IQR [23–64] in the reperfusion 
period (p=0.001 versus baseline) (Fig. 1). Of note, DAO concentrations correlated inversely with histamine 
concentrations in the anhepatic phase (r=−0,68; p=0.001) and during reperfusion (r=−0.53, p=0.02). In 
patients with ESLD undergoing OLT, median DAO concentrations increased from 2.1ng/mL (IQR 1.5–4.0) at 
BL to 36.2 ng/mL (IQR 20.4–50.2) in the anhepatic phase (p=0.001 versus baseline), and further to 41.6 ng/
mL (IQR 24.6–64.3) in the reperfusion period (p=0.001 versus baseline). In one patient with acute liver failure 
undergoing OLT, DAO concentrations increased from 17.5ng/ml at BL to 20.4ng/mL in the anhepatic phase, and 
later decreased to 12.6ng/mL in the reperfusion period. Neither the amount and type of fuids, nor the number of 
blood products administered during transplantation correlated with DAO concentrations.
Efect of liver function on plasma histamine and DAO concentrations. Tere was no statistically 
signifcant correlation between MELD score, prothrombin time, serum albumin or total bilirubin with plasma 
histamine or DAO concentrations at baseline. Furthermore, no signifcant correlation was found between the 
plasma histamine or DAO concentrations and AST as a marker of I/R injury at the end of OLT or on day 1 afer 
transplantation.
Efect of clinical signifcant portal hypertension on plasma histamine and DAO concentrations. Seventeen patients (80%) with ESLD included in our study fulflled the criteria of clinically signifcant 
portal hypertension, 4 (20%) patients did not. Plasma histamine (p=0.6) and DAO (p=0.33) concentration 
were not signifcantly diferent between patients with or without clinical signifcant portal hypertension at baseline before OLT. Te median plasma histamine concentration during reperfusion was signifcantly higher in 
patients with clinical signifcant portal hypertension than in patients without (2.4nM, IQR [0.5–3.1] vs. 0.54nM, 
IQR [0.5–0.5]; p=0.03). However, there were no statistically signifcant diferences in plasma histamine or DAO 
concentrations at any other time-point between patients with or without signs of clinical signifcant portal hypertension during our study.
Norepinephrine requirements and concentrations of histamine and DAO during OLT. During 
OLT, the median norepinephrine infusion rate was 0.287 mcg/kg/min, IQR [0.1–1.0]. Te median cumulative 
norepinephrine dose administered during OLT was 4.5mg [range 1.3–20.0]. Tere was no signifcant correlation 
between plasma histamine concentrations and norepinephrine requirements. Interestingly, the maximal intraoperative norepinephrine infusion rate correlated signifcantly with DAO concentrations in the anhepatic phase 
(r=0.58; p=0.011) and afer reperfusion (r=0.56; p=0.022). Te total intra-operative norepinephrine dose 
correlated signifcantly with DAO concentrations in the anhepatic phase (r =0.46; p=0.049), but not in the 
reperfusion phase (r=0.38; p=0.11). In the ROC curve analysis, DAO during the anhepatic phase exhibited 
an AUC of 0.85 (95% confdence interval, 0.62–0.97; p=0.0001) for the norepinephrine requirement of at least 
0.3mcg/kg/min or higher. Te sensitivity and specifty for DAO in the anhepatic phase with an optimal cut-of 
value of greater than 33.4ng/mL were 80% and 89%, respectively. Results of ROC curve analysis of DAO in the 
reperfusion period and plasma histamine in the anhepatic phase and afer reperfusion were of poor prognostic 
value to predict higher vasopressor support. In our patient population, the duration of surgery did not signifcantly correlate with cumulative norepinephrine use.
Tryptase release and endogenous heparinization. To assess whether changes in histamine concentrations were due to increased mast cell activity occurring during OLT, plasma-tryptase concentrations were 
quantifed. In all except one patient, plasma-tryptase concentrations remained stable afer induction of anesthesia 
(4.3 μg/l, IQR [2.6–6.8] vs. 4.1 μg/l, IQR [2.6–6.3]. In one patient, plasma-tryptase concentrations increased by 
82% from baseline, fulflling the criteria for mast cell activation21. In this patient, we measured the highest plasma 
histamine concentration prior to skin incision (48nM; i.e.>3SDs above the median of OLT patients included 
into this study).
In 4 out of 5 patients undergoing OLT, the anti-FXa activity increased from <0.1U/mL at baseline to 0.1U/
mL [0.1–0.75] in the anhepatic phase. In addition, in all patients aPTT increased signifcantly in comparison to 
baseline, and delayed clotting was observed in thromboelastometry without heparinase. Taken together, these 
results suggest endogenous heparinization in patients undergoing OLT.
Discussion
Te present study examined the regulation of histamine and its degrading enzyme DAO in patients undergoing 
OLT, and assessed whether histamine or DAO correlate with norepinephrine requirements during OLT. Baseline 
histamine and DAO concentrations were signifcantly elevated in patients undergoing OLT. Plasma histamine 
concentrations markedly decreased during OLT, whereas DAO concentrations increased manifold, which correlated with the intraoperative norepinephrine requirements during OLT.
Previous studies have demonstrated that plasma histamine concentrations were greater in cirrhotic patients 
compared to healthy controls6,20. Our fndings are in agreement and extend those fndings to ESLD patients 
scheduled for OLT. Greater plasma histamine concentrations in patients with ESLD likely result from reduced

hepatic clearance of histamine in advanced liver disease22. In the clinical setting of OLT an anhepatic period is 
required, where the hepatic clearance of histamine is completely abolished. Terefore, it would be expected that 
histamine plasma concentrations increase during OLT. Surprisingly, plasma histamine concentrations decrease 
during the anhepatic phase and afer reperfusion in patients undergoing OLT when compared to histamine concentrations at baseline. Tis may partially be due to intravenous administration of 40mg dexamethasone before 
the anhepatic phase as part of immunosuppression protocol in our patients. In fact, there is no sufcient literature about efects of steroids on histamine and DAO levels in patients sufering from ESLD or undergoing OLT. 
Dunsky et al. described in their study that corticosteroids induce a prominent decrease in leucocyte histamine 
due to a depletion of basophils without a decrease in histamine content per basophil in atopic subjects23. Another 
study in newborn rat intestine suggested that DAO activity may be induced by hydrocortisone24. Elevated DAO 
levels observed in our patients, and consequently raised metabolism of histamine may have further decreased 
plasma histamine concentrations.
In contrast to our results, Lorenz et al. demonstrated that plasma histamine concentrations increase in pigs 
exposed to experimental liver transplantation25. However, in contrast to human OLT, no steroids have been 
administered at any time in this study. Another study showed that systemic histamine concentrations increase 
in patients undergoing major abdominal surgeries. Te increase in histamine concentrations was explained by 
administration of anesthetic drugs, infusion of plasma and manipulation of the gut7
. Although similar triggers for 
histamine release suggested by Lorenz et al. were also present during OLT in our patients, the systemic histamine 
concentration decreased. Some explanations exist for these contradicting results. Firstly, diferent anesthetics and 
muscle relaxants, which are not in routine clinical use anymore, were used by Lorenz et al. Histamine release by 
older anesthetics and muscle relaxants was a well-described phenomenon, and could be reduced by the development of newer anesthetics and muscle relaxants such as propofol, sevofurane and rocuronium, which were 
used in our study. In addition, the porcine OLTs described by Lorenz et al. were performed on porto-jugular 
bypass25, which was not the case in our study. Furthermore, in the study of Lorenz et al., abdominal surgeries 
were performed without caval clamping7
. Of note is, that physiological alterations largely difer between surgeries 
performed in bicaval clamping without bypass and those performed with bypass or without bicaval clamping. 
Tese varying physiological conditions might serve as an explanation for diferent histamine secretion patterns 
between studies.
Tis is the frst systematic investigation demonstrating elevated concentrations of DAO in patients with liver 
disease. Of note, DAO is rapidly metabolized by rat liver26. Tus, the increased baseline concentration of DAO 
might be explained by a decreased clearance of DAO in patients with ESLD. Te most striking fnding of this 
study was the manifold increase in DAO concentrations during OLT comparable in magnitude to early pregnancy27, and the likely resultant inverse correlation between DAO and histamine. Te increase in systemic concentration of DAO during OLT can explain the degradation of histamine. We have recently shown that plasma 
levels of DAO (29–52ng/mL) comparable to those observed in the anhepatic phase can rapidly lower plasma histamine concentrations by ~50–85% within 10minutes27. Tus, the increase in DAO is a mechanistic explanation 
for the observed decrease in histamine concentrations in patients undergoing OLT.
A decrease in the hepatic clearance of DAO during the anhepatic phase is conceivably a major contributor to 
the acute and massive rise in DAO. However, several other factors may increase the release of diamine-oxidase 
during OLT. Heparin is known to release DAO into the systemic circulation18,28,29, and it has been described that 
heparin metabolism is impaired in liver failure30. Our results suggest that endogenous heparinization is present 
in patients undergoing OLT. Tus, the observed increase in systemic DAO concentration during OLT might be 
explained by the absence of hepatic clearance of heparin during the anhepatic phase30–32. Moreover, prothrombin 
complex concentrates (PCC) contain variable concentrations of heparin33, and administration of PCC during 
OLT could increase systemic heparin concentrations. Te elevated heparin concentrations afer administration 
of PCC could trigger the secretion of DAO. However, we found substantial increases in DAO concentrations in 
patients not receiving PCCs, making an association between administration of PCC and elevated DAO concentrations unlikely. Another pathophysiological pathway contributing to the gradual increase of systemic DAO 
concentration during OLT might be the DAO release from the gut. Cross clamping of the caval vein leads to a 
reduction of the cardiac output and subsequently to an intestinal hypoperfusion with venous congestion, representing a period of temporary intestinal ischemia34. Te following breakdown of the intestinal mucosal barrier 
is associated with a high DAO release from the intestinal mucosa into the circulation24,35. Taken together, the 
increased DAO concentrations observed in patients undergoing OLT might be a net efect of reduced hepatic 
DAO clearance, increased heparin induced DAO release and DAO release from the gut injured by transient 
hypoperfusion during OLT.
Histamine plasma concentrations as low as 11 nM increase the heart rate by approximately 15% and widen 
the gap between systolic and diastolic pressure by 10% in healthy humans3
. Experimental studies yield conficting 
results when assessing the association between histamine and cardiovascular changes during liver transplantation. While Hansen et al. proposed that histamine does not contribute to arterial hypotension afer revascularization during OLT in pigs5
, Lorenz et al. demonstrated that administration of antihistaminergic drugs during 
porcine OLT diminished arterial hypotension in the revascularization phase25,36. In the current study, histamine 
concentrations did not correlate with the norepinephrine requirements in patients undergoing OLT. Uniformly 
low levels of histamine due to degradation by DAO may have contributed to that fnding. In contrast, we found 
that plasma DAO concentrations correlate with the norepinephrine requirements in the anhepatic phase and 
afer revascularization during OLT. Norepinephrine is used to counteract hypotension which can result in or 
refect intestinal hypoxemia, which may itself trigger DAO release. For example, hemorrhagic shock increased 
DAO levels 6-fold in rabbits27, and an hour of intestinal ischemia increased DAO concentrations 3.6-fold in rats24. 
Such an increase in DAO is conceivably accentuated in the presence of decreased clearance of DAO during the

anhepatic phase. Interestingly, DAO levels also rise 100-fold in anaphylactic shock in mastocytosis patients17, so 
that increased DAO release levels may partly refect intestinal ischemia.
Te current study has some limitations; the sample size was relatively small and therefore does not allow 
meaningful subgroup analysis according to the underlying etiology. Detailed correlation analysis between measured histamine and DAO concentrations and hemodynamic variables such as heart rate, mean arterial pressure, 
systemic vascular resistance or cardiac output could not be determined. Tus, we were unable to assess a contribution of histamine or DAO to compromised hemodynamics in patients undergoing OLT. Furthermore, the concentrations of histamine, DAO and tryptase during OLT could be underestimated due dilution by intraoperative 
crystalloid and colloid administration. Finally, this study did not directly quantify hepatic histamine clearance, 
since we have only measured histamine concentrations in the systemic circulation and not in the portal vein or 
the hepatic artery. Despite these limitations, this is the frst study assessing concentrations of histamine and DAO 
in patients undergoing OLT. Our fndings demonstrating an inverse correlation between histamine and DAO 
and the association between DAO and norepinephrine requirements in patients undergoing OLT are novel, and 
underline that the balance between histamine and DAO is of utmost importance for hemodynamic stability. 
Further studies assessing the signifcance of DAO in the clinical and experimental setting of OLT and other major 
surgeries should be promoted.
Conclusion
Te results of this study show that patients with ESLD undergoing OLT have elevated baseline plasma concentrations of histamine and its degrading enzyme DAO. During OLT, plasma histamine concentrations markedly 
decreased, whereas DAO concentrations increased manifold. Te increase in diamine oxidase is associated with 
hemodynamic compromise as measured by norepinephrine requirements in patients undergoing OLT.
