Abstract
Background: Perioperative hyperglycemia is associated with poor outcomes yet evidence to guide intraoperative
goals and treatment modalities during non-cardiac surgery are lacking. End-stage liver disease is associated with
altered glucose homeostasis; patients undergoing liver transplantation display huge fluctuations in blood glucose
(BG) and represent a population of great interest. Here, we conduct a randomized trial to compare the effects of
strict versus conventional glycemic control during orthotopic liver transplant (OLT).
Methods: Following approval by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Michigan Medical School and
informed consent, 100 adult patients undergoing OLT were recruited. Patients were randomized to either strict
(target BG 80–120 mg/dL) or conventional (target BG 180–200 mg/dL) BG control with block randomization for
diabetic and nondiabetic patients. The primary outcomes measured were 1-year patient and graft survival assessed
on an intention to treat basis. Graft survival is defined as death or needing re-transplant (www.unos.org). Three and
5-year patient and graft survival, infectious and biliary complications were measured as secondary outcomes. Data
were examined using univariate methods and Kaplan-Meir survival analysis. A sensitivity analysis was performed to
compare patients with a mean BG of ≤120 mg/dL and those > 120 mg/dL regardless of treatment group.
Results: There was no statistically significant difference in patient survival between conventional and strict control
respectively;1 year, 88% vs 88% (p-0.99), 3 years, 86% vs 84% (p- 0.77), 5 years, 82% vs 78. % (p-0.36). Graft survival
was not different between conventional and strict control groups at 1 year, 88% vs 84% (p-0.56), 3 years 82% vs
76% (p-0.46), 5 years 78% vs 70% (p-0.362).
Conclusion: There was no difference in patient or graft survival between intraoperative strict and conventional
glycemic control during OLT.
Trial registration: Clinical trial number and registry: www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT00780026. This trial was
retrospectively registered on 10/22/2008.
Background
Perioperative hyperglycemia is associated with poor
outcomes including surgical site infections, possibly related to impaired phagocytic function, [1] and increased
length of hospital stay. The evidence supporting strict
control in critically ill patients was first published
almost 16 years ago, [2] but the findings were not
confirmed within other studies, the results of which
suggest a lower risk of death with conventional control
rather than strict control [3, 4]. During cardiac surgery
[5] there is a significant reduction in pulmonary, renal
complications and death with blood glucose (BG) < 200
mg/dL although there is no improved outcome with
strict glucose control (target BG was between 80 and
100 mg/dl) [6]. Despite increasing trends towards treating high BG values in the perioperative setting the degree of control remains controversial [7].

Patients presenting for liver transplantation frequently
display insulin resistance, termed hepatogenous diabetes
[8, 9]. In addition, surgical stress, steroids, transfusion
and the onset of gluconeogenesis after reperfusion of the
new graft result in glucose instability. A retrospective
study revealed better outcomes for patients undergoing
orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) when the mean intraoperative BG was kept below 150 mg/dL [10] but prospective studies evaluating BG management during OLT
are lacking. Here, we conducted a prospective randomized trial comparing strict versus conventional glucose
control for patients undergoing OLT at a single
academic medical center. We hypothesized that strict
intra-operative blood glucose control improves one-year
survival and decreases surgical complications, including
infections, following OLT.
Methods
Study design and patient selection
Following approval from University of Michigan Medical
School Institutional Review Board, Ann Arbor, Michigan
(HUM 0016106/HUM 00139554) and written informed
consent, adult patients undergoing OLT were randomized
to either strict or conventional glycemic control (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT00780026). Block randomization was
performed by the study coordinator for diabetic and nondiabetic patients. Subjects were blinded to randomization
group but not the clinicians. Post-operative glucose control was directed by the same standard sliding scale protocol used by the intensive care unit for both study groups.
This clinical trial is in compliance with CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement [11].
Adult patients ≥18 years’ old who were undergoing liver
transplantation were approached for study participation.
The exclusion criteria included: Multi-organ transplant
recipients, patients receiving an ABO incompatible liver,
HIV infected patients, recipients of an organ from a HIV
positive donor, patients who were unable to give informed
consent, use of investigational drugs at the time of enrollment or within 30 days or 5 half-lives of enrollment, patients transplanted for hepatocellular carcinoma exceeding
3 nodules or with nodule diameter larger than 5 cm, and a
history of malignancy of any organ system treated or
untreated within the past 5 years, with the exception of
localized basal cell carcinoma of the skin.
All patients received standard induction of anesthesia
using fentanyl (1–2 mcg/kg), propofol (0.5–2 mg/kg), and
muscle relaxation using either succinylcholine and/or cisatracurium as deemed appropriate by the anesthesiologist.
Anesthesia was maintained with volatile agent. Infusions of
cisatracurium for muscle relaxation and fentanyl for analgesia were continued throughout surgery. Methylprednisolone 500 mg was given as a standard immunosuppression
to all patients. The use of inotropes and vasopressors were
at the discretion of the anesthesiologist and in response to
the patient’s hemodynamic status. Invasive hemodynamic
monitoring included arterial and central venous access for
all patients. Transesophageal echocardiography was placed
unless contra-indicated by esophageal pathology or difficulty of placement. Pulmonary artery catheters were placed
when thought necessary by the anesthesiologist.
Intraoperative blood glucose management
A dedicated peripheral IV was used for all intravenous
insulin administration and infusion tubing was flushed
with 20 mls of insulin solution before the tubing was
connected directly to the cannula without a carrier. Treatment algorithms were dictated by randomization. BG
analysis were performed on arterial blood samples (Gem
Premier 3000 ABG analyzer, Instrumentation Laboratory,
USA) and repeated every 30 min.
The BG target for intervention in the strict glycemic
control group was between 80 and 120 mg/dL. The trigger
for treatment was a single BG > 130 or two BG > 120
when checked 30 min apart. Insulin treatment was by
intravenous infusion, the rate of which was varied resultant upon glucose level and response to therapy according
to the protocol (Table 1).
The BG target for intervention in the conventional control group was 180-200 mg/dL. The trigger for treatment
included one value > 200 or two values > 180 mg/dL when
checked 30 min apart. Insulin infusion rate was titrated as
per protocol. In addition to the continuous intravenous
infusion, insulin by intravenous bolus was given if BG >
200 mg/dL (Table 2).
Hypoglycemia was defined as a single BG < 70 mg/dL
and was treated with 15 g of 50% dextrose. BG was evaluated to assess the response to treatment every 15 min until
BG > 70 mg/dL.
Outcomes
The primary outcomes were patient and graft survival at
1 year. Graft survival is defined by the United Network for
Organ Sharing (www.unos.org) as death or needing retransplant. Secondary outcomes included patient and graft
survival at 3 and 5 years, hospital length of stay, biliary
and infectious complications (30 days), cardiac, thromboembolic complications, renal failure needing dialysis, reoperation and wound dehiscence at one year.
Statistical analysis
Basic descriptive statistics were calculated for demographics. Normality of continuous measures was assessed using
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Pearson Chi-square or Fisher
exact tests (for categorical variables) and independent
two-tailed t-tests or Mann-Whitney U tests (for continuous variables) were used to assess baseline univariate clinical differences between patients who received strict

glucose control and those who received conventional
treatment. Survival and graft survival were analyzed using
Kaplan Meier curves, with the log rank test for significance on an intention to treat basis.
Analysis was performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC) and SPSS version 21.0 (IBM, Somers, NY). Computer-generated randomization was performed using STATA statistical software (StataCorp LP,
College Station, Texas). A p-value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
A sensitivity analysis was performed to compare patients with a mean BG of ≤120 mg/dL and those > 120
mg/dL regardless of randomized group. This cutoff was
chosen based on treatment threshold for the strict
control group.
Power analysis
Based on published data [2] the 1-year mortalities for the
conventional and strict arms are predicted to be 22 and 9%
respectively. A sample size of 89 has a greater than 80%
power to detect a statistical difference between groups at
the p = 0.05 level. A block randomization for diabetic and
non-diabetic patients was used to ensure equal distribution
of such patients between the treatment groups.
Results
Study populations and demographic characteristics
Of the 175 patients screened, 105 patients were consented (two transplants were cancelled before enrollment, two patients were consented but not enrolled at
transplant, one patient died during transplantation) and
100 patients completed the study; 50 were randomized
to the conventional group and 50 were randomized to
the strict glucose control group (Fig. 1). All patients
were included for analysis and no patients were lost to
follow up. There were no demographic or comorbidity
differences between groups (Table 3). Differences in
transplant characteristics and surgical factors were not
demonstrable between groups (Table 4).
Insulin dose, treatment response and hypoglycemia
Within the conventional group the mean intraoperative
BG was 143.3 mg/dL [interquartile range (IQR) 123.8 mg/
dL to 167.1 mg/dL] and for the strict group 130.7 mg/dL
[IQR 112.2 mg/dL to 154.8 mg/dL] (p = 0.020, Table 5).
Patients in the strict control group received more insulin
(median: 24.4 units [IQR 14.2 to 38.0] vs. 10.0 units [IQR
5.9 to 17.8], p < 0.001). Mean BG values over time showed
statistically significant difference (p = 0.037) between the
strict and standard control group with a divergent
trajectory following reperfusion of donor graft (Fig. 2).
Within the conventional group, seven patients were exposed to at least one hypoglycemic incident; six patients
had one episode, one patient had two episodes. Within
the strict glucose control group 13 patients exhibited one
hypoglycemic episode.
Survival and graft loss
The primary study (one-year survival) and secondary
outcomes for graft and patient (three and five-year survival) are represented in Table 6. Patient survival was
not different between conventional and strict groups respectively, (1 year: 88% vs 88%, p = 0.999; 3 years: 86% vs
84%, p = 0.779; 5 years: 82% vs 78%, p = 0.617). There
was no statistical difference in causes of mortality between the two groups (data not shown). Graft survival
was not different between conventional and strict control groups respectively, (1 year: 88% vs 84%, p = 0.564;
3 years: 82% vs 76%, p = 0.461; 5 years: 78% vs 70%,
p = 0.362). In-hospital graft survival was not statistically

(p = 0.585) and viral infection (p = 0.505) (Table 6).
Sensitivity analysis
A sensitivity analysis was performed to compare patients
with a mean BG of ≤120 mg/dL and those > 120 mg/dL,
regardless of treatment group, to assess the response to
insulin treatment or insulin resistance. The sensitivity
analysis included all 100 patients; of those with BG <
120 mg/dL, 19 (70.4%) were from the strict control
group and 8 (29.6%) were from the conventional group.
There was statistically significant improved survival for
patients with a mean intraoperative BG of ≤120 mg/dL
with a log rank p value of 0.047 (Fig. 4).
After adjustment for patient comorbidities, chronic
preoperative steroid use, and intraoperative transfusion
using a multivariable Cox proportional hazard model,
blood glucose ≤120 mg/dL did not show any significant
difference in survival.
Discussion
We report the first randomized study directly comparing
strict versus conventional glucose control during the intraoperative period of liver transplantation with comprehensive long term follow up. We found no difference in
patient or graft survival after OLT between the conventional and strict glucose control regimens when analyzed
on an intention to treat basis. However, the sensitivity
analysis revealed improved survival for those patients with
a mean blood glucose ≤120 mg/dL regardless of treatment
group, perhaps identifying a group of ‘responders’ or implying the requirement for more aggressive insulin management than that used within our strict control group.
Although patients in the strict group received greater than
twice the dose of insulin and exhibited an approximate 10%
reduction in mean intraoperative blood glucose when compared to the conventional group; these differences may not
have been large enough to produce a clinically significant difference in the outcomes measured. However, most divergence in blood glucose between groups can be appreciated
only after reperfusion perhaps illustrating that reliance on
differences in the mean of the total operative time to be limited. The strict glucose regimen was modified from the landmark NICE-SUGAR trial, [12] the most aggressive regimen
published to date, and associated with a 7% incidence of severe hypoglycemia (< 40 mg/dL). Within the conventional
group, 7 patients were exposed to at least one hypoglycemic
incident; 6 patients had one episode, 1 patient had two episodes. Within the strict glucose control group 13 patients exhibited 1 hypoglycemic episode. Numerically, hypoglycemic

episodes were higher in the strict control group although
there was no statistically significant difference between the
number of patients exposed to hypoglycemia or the total
number of hypoglycemic episodes between groups. The routine provision of abundant anesthesia resources for liver
transplantation allowed for frequent glucose monitoring and
rapid intervention for changes in plasma glucose when
detected and may enhance safety for aggressive glucose management in this patient population. Patients undergoing liver
transplant have the potential to exhibit hyperglycemia due to
insulin resistance [9] and the exogenous administration of
steroids may make hypoglycemia less likely; it appears that
aggressive insulin therapy is not associated with a greater risk
of hypoglycemia compared to conventional control and can
be managed safely during the intraoperative phase of liver
transplantation.
We found a statistically significant difference in patient
survival if mean BG was less than 120 mg/dl in the sensitivity analysis although the adjusted analysis did not show any
significant difference A recent prospective study investigated postoperative glycemic control and impact on outcomes at one year following liver transplantation and
revealed a reduced incidence of infection with BG levels of
140 mg/dl but a higher incidence of moderate hypoglycemia
(41–70 mg/dl) was described [13]. We did not continue
randomization into the postoperative period but doing so
as well as monitoring all elements of glucose control
throughout the first postoperative year are likely of critical
importance for the outcomes measured and represent a design flaw within this study.
Hyperglycemia is associated with a spectrum of poor outcomes including poor graft survival [14] and in animal
studies is associated with defective handling of calcium in
cardiac myocytes resulting in poor cardiac function [15]. Insulin treatment appears to reduce afterload and improve
ventricular relaxation although changes in myocardial perfusion or contractility have not been demonstrated [16].
Treatment of hyperglycemia, especially in patients with
non-insulin dependent DM, has been shown to improve
immune function, hypercoagulability and possibly reduce
the risk of infectious complications [1]; it is postulated that
hyperglycemia results in impaired phagocytosis secondary
to high intra-cellular calcium concentrations. In addition to
hepatgeneous diabetes, immunosuppression with steroids
and stress hyperglycemia likely contribute to profound fluctuations in BG levels during liver transplantation [8, 17, 18].
It is interesting to note that we found no differences in infectious complications between groups here. The precise
mechanism of stress induced hyperglycemia is not clear but
it is associated with poor post-operative outcomes following
non-cardiac surgery [19]. Insulin resistance is likely a primary factor and general anesthesia per se may be contributory; a recent animal study reveals an increase in insulin
resistance by almost 50% and insulin effects at the liver
were almost completely suppressed [20]. Liver transplantation is associated with potential for significant
blood loss and transfusion. Citrate phosphate dextrose
(CPD) preservative solutions contribute to serum glucose; there was no difference in transfusion requirements between treatment groups.
Despite decades of research conducted within the intensive care setting glucose control remains controversial and
strict control is currently not recommended for critically
ill patients [21]. The thresholds to treat hyperglycemia in
the cardiac surgical population may be lower compared to
non-cardiac surgical patients potentially related to the

effects of metabolic syndrome and hyperglycemia during
cardiopulmonary bypass [22]. It is possible that patients
undergoing liver transplantation share similarity with
cardiac surgical patients as signaled by the results of our
sensitivity analysis. There is a lack of robust data from the
perioperative setting in the non-cardiac surgical patients.
Our current practice is mostly based upon retrospective
investigations which suggests BG > 200 mg/dL is associated with poor outcomes [23, 24]. Any improved outcome
implied from our sensitivity analysis may not only impact
OLT but may be of broader significance for other noncardiac surgical patients as there is lack of good evidence
in defining treatment strategies As implied by our data, it
is possible to implement tight control safely with careful
monitoring of BG during the intraoperative phase of an
OLT [25]. Outcome differences in perioperative glycemic
control may not be solely related to glycemic control per
se, but may also be attributed to differences in the level of
supervision, accuracy of monitoring, clinical setting and
infusion practices [26].
Previous studies have reported that glucose variability
was associated with acute kidney injury following OLT
[24, 27, 28] which was not related directly to hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. However, this study did not detect a difference in the requirement for dialysis postoperatively between groups but we did not measure

glucose variability. In terms of detecting glucose variability, technological advances for continuous glucose monitoring and real time alerting systems may be helpful in
achieving stability of BG [29, 30]. Intravenous insulin infusions have advantage over [31] subcutaneous bolus or
the widely used sliding scale in maintaining steady state
to prevent glucose variability [32–34].
There are limitations with our study. The sample size
was small and the study population was heterogeneous.
We did not achieve the target BG in the strict group, despite the use of an aggressive insulin protocol, potentially
related to insulin resistance seen in patients with liver disease and the measurable difference in BG between groups
may have been of insufficient magnitude to result in a
meaningful clinical difference between groups. Although
current evidence does not recommend strict control in
the perioperative period, our strict control group was
defined based on the existing literature at the time of
study initiation. However, the statistically significant difference in the intraoperative BG level between groups
diverged as the case progressed. The study focused exclusively on intraoperative glycemic control; including the
immediate postoperative phase would have been a major
improvement in study design. However, differences in patient survival following liver transplant are associated with
intraoperative BG control [10] and a large retrospective
study in non-cardiac surgery found that a higher mean
intraoperative BG increased the odds for higher postoperative BG, [35] implying that control of the intraoperative phase of care is a rational research question. In
addition, poor glycemic control in the intraoperative
period adversely impacts outcome [5, 36, 37] yet the
influence of postoperative management cannot be underestimated [35]. Lastly, we did not evaluate glucose

homeostasis in donors but improved recipient outcome
has been achieved with improved glycemic control in donors [38]. A direct relationship between donor and recipient glucose variability may exist and be an unmeasured
confounder within this study.
Conclusion
In conclusion, there is no patient or graft survival advantage with strict glucose management compared to conventional glucose management during the intraoperative
phase for patients undergoing liver transplantation when
evaluated on an intention to treat basis.
