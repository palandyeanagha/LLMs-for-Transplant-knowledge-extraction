Background and Objective: It is unclear if stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT)
or transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is better for the treatment of inoperable
early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aimed to retrospectively compare
the efficacy of SBRT to TACE in patients with inoperable Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer
(BCLC)-A stage HCC.
Materials and Methods: In this multi-institutional retrospective study, a total of 326
patients with inoperable BCLC-A stage HCC were enrolled. Totally, 167 patients initially
received SBRT and 159 initially received TACE. Overall survival (OS), local control (LC),
intrahepatic control (IC), and progression-free survival (PFS) were evaluated in univariable
and propensity-score matched analyses.
Results: There was a smaller median tumor size in the SBRT group than in the TACE
group (3.4 cm vs. 7.2 cm, P < 0.001). After propensity score matching in the selection of
95 patient pairs, SBRT had better LC, IC, and PFS than TACE but showed comparable
OS. The accumulative 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates were 85.7, 65.1, and 62.8% in the
SBRT group and 83.6, 61.0, and 50.4% in the TACE group, respectively (P = 0.29). The
accumulative 1-, 3-, and 5-year PFS were 63.4, 35.9, and 27.5% in the SBRT group and
53.5, 27.4, and 14.2% in the TACE group, respectively (P = 0.049). The accumulative
1-, 3-, and 5-year LC were 86.8, 62.5, and 56.9% in the SBRT group and 69.3, 53.3,
and 36.6% in the TACE group, respectively (P = 0.0047). The accumulative 1-, 3-, and
5-year IC were 77.3, 45.9, and 42.4% in the SBRT group and 57.3, 34.1, and 17.7% in
the TACE group, respectively (P = 0.003). On multivariate analysis, treatment (SBRT vs.
TACE) was a significant covariate associated with local and intrahepatic control (HR =
1.59; 95% CI: 1.03–2.47; P = 0.04; HR = 1.61; 95% CI: 1.13–2.29; P = 0.009).

Conclusions: SBRT was an alternative to TACE for inoperable BCLC-A stage HCC
with better local and intrahepatic control. Controlled clinical trials are recommended to
evaluate the actual effects of this novel regimen adequately.

INTRODUCTION
Patients with early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are
candidates for potentially curative treatment options, such
as liver transplantation, liver resection, and radiofrequency
ablation, and they have a 5-year survival rate of 40–70% (1).
However, some patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer
(BCLC) stage A disease refuse to undergo surgery, or the
procedure may be deemed too high risk for them. There is
an urgent clinical need for a more effective therapy for HCC.
Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is an established local
treatment for patients with unresectable and non-transplantable
stages of HCC with compensated liver disease and without
extrahepatic spread (2, 3). Although the aforementioned
conditions define BCLC stage B disease, TACE can also be applied
to those with earlier-stage (BCLC stage A) disease who are not
considered for surgery or ablation (4, 5).
Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is an advanced
external beam radiation therapy technique that delivers large
ablative doses of radiation and low fractionation (6). There
is increasing evidence (primarily from non-randomized
controlled trials) supporting the clinical application of SBRT
as a non-invasive treatment in patients with unresectable or
recurrent HCC (7–10). SBRT can provide encouraging outcomes
comparable to those associated with curative treatment options,
including liver resection and radiofrequency ablation (11–13).
Several studies have reported good clinical outcomes using
SBRT in HCC with or without TACE (14–17). However, few
comparative studies have analyzed the use of SBRT vs. TACE in
BCLC-A stage HCC. In this retrospective study, we aimed to
compare the long-term survival rates after SBRT and TACE in
patients with early-stage HCC who were ineligible for resection
or ablation therapies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Datasets from January 2009 to January 2017 from two different
institutions with a tertiary-A hospital in the Guangxi region of
China, Cancer Hospital and Rui Kang Hospital, were used in this
study. All cases of TACE were collected from Cancer Hospital,
and cases of SBRT were collected from Rui Kang Hospital.
The eligibility criterion was the presence of BCLC stage
A HCC in patients who were not considered for surgery, or
refused to undergo surgery and/or local radiofrequency ablative
therapies, and received SBRT or TACE as initial treatment.
HCC diagnosis was established based on histopathology or
according to the clinical criteria for HCC diagnosis (18).
Exclusion criteria were as follows: (a) recurrence after other
treatments, (b) intrahepatic cholangiocellular carcinoma, (c)
gallbladder cancer, (d) liver metastases, and/or (e) prior history
of conventional abdominal radiotherapy. All hospital charts and
patients’ documents were carefully reviewed.
Transarterial Chemoembolization (TACE)
A French catheter (4 F−5 F) was inserted into the abdominal
aorta through the right femoral artery using the Seldinger
technique. Selective arteriography of the hepatic artery was
carried out for tumor location. Hepatic angiography was
performed for the detection of any obvious tumor staining in
the remaining liver. Subsequently, an emulsion of oxaliplatin
or lobaplatin or cisplatinum (20–100 mg), pharmorubicin or
pirarubicin (10–40 mg), and lipiodol (2–15 ml) was infused
via the catheter (15, 19). The effect of TACE was evaluated
by computed tomography (CT) at the 1-month follow-up.
Treatment was repeated one to six times (median, 3) at 3–6-week
intervals in the TACE group.
Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy
(SBRT)
SBRT was performed as described (7, 11, 20). Briefly, gross
tumor volume was outlined under the fusion image of CT
and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by comparing different
imaging phases, and the gross tumor volume was expanded by
0–5 mm for the formation of the planning target volume (PTV).
SBRT was implemented using a CyberKnife system (Accuray
Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA). A 28–50 Gy dose of radiation was
delivered in one to five fractions on consecutive days at the 55–
80% isodose line that covered at least 97% of the planning target
volume. Fractionation schedules and total doses were chosen
according to the tumor size and dose–volume constraints of the
organs at risk.
Response Evaluation and Follow-Up
The evaluations included laboratory tests and imaging with
contrast-enhanced CT and/or MRI at 1 month after the
procedure and every 3–6 months thereafter. The laboratory
examinations assessed levels of alanine transaminase (ALT),
aspartate transaminase (AST), prothrombin time, levels of
total bilirubin, albumin, and alpha-fetoprotein. The modified
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors guideline was
used to describe changes in the treated areas (21). Local
recurrence/progress was defined as the reappearance of
radiologic hallmarks of HCC for in-field-treated PTV lesions
and/or progressive increase in tumor sizes during follow-up.
Intrahepatic recurrence was defined as the reappearance of
radiologic hallmarks of HCC (hypervascularity in the arterial
phase with washout in the portal venous or delayed phases)

and out-field-treated (PTV) lesions in the whole parenchyma
of the liver. For progressive increase in tumor sizes without
typical CT/MRI characteristics, diagnosis was confirmed
by histopathology.
Statistical Analysis
R version 3.6.1 software (2019 Microsoft Corporation) was used
for the statistical analysis. P < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant. Kaplan–Meier curves with the log-rank test were
used to calculate patients’ overall survival (OS), local control
(LC) rate, intrahepatic control (IC) rate, and progression-free
survival (PFS). In addition, accumulative overall survival (OS)
was calculated starting from the date of the first treatment to
death from any cause, with patients censored at the end of
the study (April 11, 2019). Accumulative PFS was calculated
starting from the date of the first treatment to the date of any
tumor recurrence, progression, or death or the date of censoring.
Accumulative LC was calculated starting from the date of the
first treatment to the date of local tumor failure or the date of
censoring. Accumulative IC was calculated starting from the date
of the first treatment to the date of intrahepatic tumor failure or
the date of censoring.
Variables without associations between each other by chisquared/Mann–Whitney tests (Figure S1). We use univariate
and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)
to identify non-associated predictive variables that contribute
toward the final multivariate. The report concordance index gives
an indication of the predictive fit (Figure S2).
To reduce selection bias and potential confounding effect of
treatment, a 1:1 nearest neighbor matching that pairs patients
who have the closest propensity scores was performed to
create a balanced cohort. The logit of the propensity score for
matching was used with a caliper of 0.2 times its standard
deviation as recommended by Austin (22), based on the potential
confounding variables including age, gender, ALBI score, ALT,
tumor size, and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels. Only patients
who were matched were included (Figure S3).
RESULTS
Patients
During the study period from January 2009 to January 2017, 326
patients with BCLC stage A HCC, who were not considered for
surgery and/or radiofrequency ablative therapies were enrolled
retrospectively. A total of 167 patients initially received SBRT, and
159 initially received TACE. Some variables differed between the
groups, including age, ALT levels, tumor size, ALBI score, and
AFP level. After propensity score matching, 95 paired patients
were selected from the SBRT and TACE groups. There was
no significant difference between the groups, and the balance
of variables in the matched cohorts was markedly improved
(Table 1).
SBRT vs. TACE
This study was concluded on April 11, 2019. The median followup time was 35.0 months in the SBRT group and 32.0 months
in the TACE group. A total of 50 cases died, and 117 cases were
right-censored, including 31 cases lost to follow-up, while 86
cases were still alive at the end of the study in the SBRT group. On
the other hand, 66 cases died, and 96 cases were right-censored,
including 41 cases lost to follow-up, while 55 cases were still alive
at the end of the study in the TACE group. During the follow-up
period, the total local and intrahepatic recurrence after SBRT was
lower than that after TACE (69/167 vs. 98/159, P = 0.037).
Before propensity score matching, the accumulative
OS (Figure 1A), PFS (Figure 1B), LC (Figure 1C), and IC
(Figure 1D) at 12, 36, and 60 months were better in patients
undergoing SBRT than in those undergoing TACE (Table 2). The
accumulative 3-year OS was 64.7% in the SBRT group and 51.0%
in the TACE group (P = 0.005, HR = 1.71, 95% CI: 1.17–2.51).
The accumulative 3-year PFS was 38.1% in the SBRT group and
27.6% in the TACE group (P = 0.0005, HR = 1.62, 95% CI:
1.22–2.16). The accumulative 3-year LC was 63.1% in the SBRT
group and 50.2% in the TACE group (P = 0.0008, HR = 1.93,
95% CI: 1.29–2.88). The accumulative 3-year IC 49.6% in the
SBRT group and 33.5% in the TACE group (P < 0.0001, HR =
2.14, 95% CI: 1.54–2.96).
After propensity score matching in the selection of 95 wellpairs patients, we found no statistically significant difference in
OS (Figure 2A); patients in the SBRT group had better long-term
PFS (Figure 2B), LC (Figure 2C), and IC (Figure 2D) than those
in the TACE group (Table 2). The accumulative 3-year OS was
65.1% in the SBRT group and 61.0% in the TACE group (P =
0.55, HR = 1.17, 95% CI: 0.7–1.96). The accumulative 3-year PFS
was 35.9% in the SBRT group and 27.4%, in the TACE group (P
= 0.081, HR = 1.37, 95% CI: 0.95–1.97). The accumulative 3-year
LC was 62.5% in the SBRT group and 53.5% in the TACE group
(P = 0.0219, HR = 1.81, 95% CI: 1.08–3.04). The accumulative
3-year IC was 45.9% in the SBRT group and 34.1% in the TACE
group (P = 0.01, HR = 1.70, 95% CI: 1.12–2.58).
Multivariable Cox Analysis
Cox proportional hazards models accounting for clustering
were used to compare the two treatment groups. The selection
of influencing factors, which were considered for multivariate
analysis, was based on LASSO analysis (Table 3). Multivariable
cox regression analysis of OS (Figure 3A) showed that three
independent predictors were size (HR = 1.12; 95% CI, 1.06–
1.17; P < 0.001), ALBI score (HR = 2.01; 95% CI: 1.46–2.77;
P < 0.001), and AFP level >400 (HR = 1.84; 95% CI: 1.12–
3.02; P = 0.02). Multivariable cox regression analysis of PFS
(Figure 3B) showed that three independent predictors were size
(HR = 1.09; 95% CI: 1.05–1.14; P < 0.001), age (HR = 0.99; 95%
CI: 0.98–1.00; P = 0.05), and AFP level >400 (HR = 1.52; 95%
CI: 1.50–2.17; P = 0.03). Multivariable cox regression analysis of
LC (Figure 3C) showed that three independent predictors were
size (HR = 1.06; 95% CI: 1.01–1.12; P = 0.02), gender/male (HR
= 2.69; 95% CI: 1.18–6.17; P = 0.02), and treatment (SBRT vs.
TACE) (HR = 1.59; 95% CI: 1.03–2.47; P = 0.04). Multivariable
cox regression analysis of IC (Figure 3D) showed that four
independent predictors were size (HR = 1.10; 95% CI: 1.05–
1.14; P < 0.001), gender/male (HR = 1.84; 95% CI: 1.06–3.21;
P = 0.031), AFP level >400 (HR = 1.61; 95% CI: 1.06–2.46; P

In our matched cohort, multivariable cox regression analysis
showed that ALBI score was the only independent predictor of
OS (HR = 1.84; 95% CI: 1.23–2.76; P = 0.003). Tumor size was
the only independent predictor of PFS (HR = 1.12; 95% CI:
1.06–1.19; P < 0.001). Treatment (SBRT vs. TACE) was the only
independent predictor of LC (HR = 2.19; 95% CI: 1.27–3.77; P
= 0.005). Treatment (SBRT vs. TACE) and tumor size were two
independent predictors of IC (HR = 1.99; 95% CI: 1.30–3.04; P
= 0.001; and HR = 1.09; 95% CI: 1.02–1.16; P = 0.014).
In the SBRT cohort, multivariable cox regression analysis
showed that AFP level and ALBI score were two independent
predictors of OS (HR = 1.34; 95% CI: 1.04–1.73; P = 0.02;
and HR = 2.84; 95% CI: 1.72–4.71; P < 0.001). The included
influencing factors were not prognostic factors for PFS, LC,
and IC.
In the TACE cohort, multivariable cox regression analysis
showed that tumor size was an independent predictor of OS (HR
= 1.09; 95% CI: 1.04–1.13; P < 0.001). Tumor size and age were
two independent predictors of PFS (HR = 1.84; 95% CI: 1.23–
2.76; P = 0.003; and HR = 0.97; 95% CI: 0.95–0.99; P < 0.001).
Age was an independent predictor of LC (HR = 0.97; 95% CI:
0.95–0.99; P = 0.02). Tumor size and age were two independent
predictors of IC (HR = 1.10; 95% CI: 1.05–1.15; P < 0.001; and
HR = 0.98; 95% CI: 0.96–0.99; P = 0.04).
Complications and Mortality
Both treatment regimens have their own specific complications.
In the TACE group, TACE-related deaths occurred in 2 (1.3%) of
159 patients after the initial TACE. The cause of death consisted
of hepatic failure in one patient and liver abscess in the other. In
the SBRT group, treatment-related deaths occurred in 2 (1.2%)
of 167 patients after SBRT due to hepatic failure. Complications

were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03. The most
common grades of acute complications in all groups were ≤3.
Fever, hepatic pain, and increased levels of ALT or AST (≥3-
fold) were the three most common TACE-related complications.
Fatigue, nausea, and vomiting were the three most common
SBRT-related complications. Elevated Child–Pugh score was
common TACE or SBRT-related hepatotoxicity (+1 score: 28/159
vs. 20/167, P = 0.22; and +2 score: 8/169 vs. 17/167, P = 0.11).
Most of the complications and hepatotoxicity were reversed by
conservative and supportive treatment.
DISCUSSION
SBRT was shown to be an alternative option for patients with
inoperable BCLC stage A disease. Our propensity match-based
analysis after locoregional therapy for 326 inoperable patients
with BCLC stage A disease in China, where hepatitis B virus
(>86.8%) was predominant, suggests that patients undergoing
SBRT have a similar OS to those undergoing TACE, with excellent
local and intrahepatic control and PFS. On multivariate analysis,
treatment (SBRT vs. TACE, HR = 1.59; 95% CI: 1.03–2.47; P
= 0.04; HR = 1.61; 95% CI: 1.13–2.29; P = 0.009) and tumor
size (HR = 1.06; 95% CI: 1.01–1.12; P = 0.02; HR = 1.10; 95%
CI: 1.05–1.14; P < 0.001) were significant covariates associated
with local and intrahepatic control. SBRT does not seem to
compromise the measured survival outcomes after TACE. Sapir
et al. (23) also reported that 209 patients with 287 HCC tumors,
and 28 of these cases with portal vein branch thrombosis (BCLCC), were treated with TACE (n = 84) or SBRT (n = 125) in
western countries, where hepatitis C virus (70%) and alcohol
abuse (20%) were the main cause of HCC. It was also found
that SBRT can be an alternative to TACE for local HCC with
one to two tumors and provided better LC, with no difference
in OS. The 1- and 2-year OS were 74.1 and 34.9% after SBRT,
and 75.3 and 54.9% after TACE, respectively. The 1- and 2-year
LC were 47.1 and 22.9% after TACE compared to 96.5 and 91.3%
after SBRT, respectively. The 1- and 2-year intrahepatic controls
were better for patients after SBRT than after TACE (56.5, 26.9%
vs. 35.9, 10.7%, respectively), favoring SBRT significantly (HR
= 3.55, 95% CI 1.94–6.52, P < 0.001). In addition, higher
AFP, previous treatment status, and branch thrombosis were
significant covariates associated with intrahepatic control in
multivariate analysis. Shen et al. compared the local control
and overall survival between SBRT (n = 46) and TACE (n =
142) in medium-sized (3–8 cm) HCC in Taiwan. The 3-year
local control rate was 73.3% for the SBRT group and 63.0%
for the TACE group. Multivariable analyses also identified the

for liver transplant with tumor necrosis at explant, and overall
survival (24).
According to BCLC guidelines, liver transplantation, liver
resection, and RFA were recommended as first-line potentially
curative treatment options for patients with early-stage HCC,
providing a long-term survival at 5 years of more than 40–
70% (1). TACE is reserved for patients with intermediate-stage
multinodular HCC, Child–Pugh class A or B disease, and good
performance status. It can also be applied to those with BCLC
stage A disease who are not considered for surgery or ablation
(4, 5). Burrel et al. (4) found that the 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival
for such patients (n = 41) treated with drug-eluting beads (DEBTACE) was 89.7, 67.8, and 33.9%, respectively. Takayasu et al.
(5) found that the 1-, 3-, 5-, and 7-year survival rates for TNM
stage I patients (n = 489) treated with TACE were 98, 78, 52,
and 38%, respectively. Takaki et al. reported that 1-, 3-, 5-,
and 10-year survival rates were 93.3%, 83.2, 61.5, and 17.6%
in the T1 group, and 93.5, 68.7, 43.5, and 12.2% in the T2
group, respectively. The 2-, 3-, and 5- year local recurrence rates
were 46, 58, and 63% in the whole group (25). In the current
study, the accumulative 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates were 83.6,
61.0, and 50.4%, local recurrence rates were 30.7, 46.7, 63.4%,
and intrahepatic recurrence rates were 42.7, 65.9, and 82.3%,
respectively, in the TACE group after propensity score matching.
Some retrospective studies showed that SBRT for primary HCC
provides high rates of durable local control (80–100%) (7, 12, 26–
28). Our LC rate in the SBRT group compared favorably to the
published literature. Thus, given the agreement with previous
literature, the higher rate of local and intrahepatic control after
SBRT in this study is most likely due to a true difference in the
treatment effectiveness, rather than an artifact from a particularly
excellent SBRT or poor TACE procedures.
Tumor diameter was an independent prognostic factor of
OS, PFS, and intrahepatic control in TACE group based on
univariable and multivariable cox analyses. Lo et al. also reported
that a tumor diameter of ≤5 cm was a good prognostic factor
of TACE (7). Tumor control rates after TACE have varied
considerably, even in prospective studies (2, 3, 29). In the use
of interventional therapy to larger HCC, certain bottlenecks
may be encountered. Embolization of the hepatic arteries could
cause tumor necrosis because these arteries may feed nutrients
to the tumor cells. However, the liver surrounding HCCs has
arterial vessels and veins and, therefore, may not undergo
complete necrosis due to arterial embolization alone. The longterm locoregional curative effect is unsatisfactory in cases with
TACE alone, especially with large tumors, as tumor cells relapse
from the intracapsular or extracapsular HCC invasion and can
rarely be eradicated (30). TACE was feasible and associated with
a higher response rate than that of TAE alone (31). DEB-TACE
showed a better local response, lower recurrence rates, and longer
time to progression than TACE (31). DEB-TACE was associated
with a significant reduction in the occurrence of serious liver
toxicity (32). However, no apparent differences in OS were
observed between both treatment groups. These results challenge
the use of DEB-TACE in HCC (33). Y90 radioembolization led
to improved time to progression compared to TACE but did not
improve OS (34).

Unlike the mechanism by which TACE works, radiotherapy
has the advantage of directly damaging the tumor cells. On
subgroup analysis, tumor diameter has a great influence on TACE
survival time and intrahepatic control, while tumor diameter
has little effect on SBRT. SBRT can also provide encouraging
outcomes comparable to radiofrequency ablation (12, 35, 36).
In our previous study, SBRT can provide encouraging curative
outcomes comparable to liver resection for small HCC. The
5-year OS rates were 70.0 and 64.4% in the SBRT and liver
resection groups, respectively (11). In the current study, we found
that SBRT was superior to TACE, providing better local and
intrahepatic control. In recent years, there have been several
reports on the combination of TACE and SBRT, suggesting
that the combination may yield better outcomes than TACE
alone. Jun et al. reported that SBRT-TACE is superior to TACE
regarding LC in patients with one or two small HCC lesions
(37). Kimura et al. found that TACE+SBRT was not better than
SBRT alone in small HCC cases (38). It may be concluded
that SBRT has a radical curative effect in these selected HCCs.
Additional multi-institutional prospective studies are warranted
for the investigation of the real effects of SBRT. The TASABR
randomized controlled trial is underway and will compare
SBRT vs. re-TACE for HCC patients who had an incomplete
response after initial TACE (39). A randomized phase 2 trial
(NCT02182687), designed to compare TACE or SBRT as a bridge
to transplant with the primary outcome as time to first additional
intervention, is underway. Another phase 2 trial (NCT02470533),
which targets patients with one to three tumors and assesses time
to any progression after SBRT or after DEB-TACE, is ongoing.
Our findings also need to be verified prospectively in HCC
patients with BCLC-A stage who are not considered for surgery
or have refused to undergo surgery and/or local radiofrequency
ablative therapies.
This study has some limitations. First, this was a retrospective,
non-randomized study, and the follow-up period was not
lengthy, and this could have obscured late effects. Second, it
is difficult to eliminate selection bias. Some variables differed
between the groups; therefore, propensity score matching was
applied at a 1:1 ratio to reduce selection bias and potential
confounding effects of treatment. We also used the albumin–
bilirubin score instead of the Child–Pugh score to reduce
subjective errors. However, the bias of selection factors cannot be
completely avoided. Controlled clinical trials are recommended
to evaluate the actual effects of this novel regimen adequately.

Su et al. SBRT vs. TACE in HCC
Third, we cannot account for differences between the two groups
that are not known, such as the experience of institutions,
patient’s financial condition, and benefit of second-line treatment
after recurrence.
In conclusion, SBRT was an alternative to TACE for
inoperable BCLC-A stage HCC with excellent local and
intrahepatic control. Controlled clinical trials are recommended
to evaluate the actual effects of this novel regimen adequately.
