Abstract
Background: Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the recommended treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) patients at Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) B-stage, whereas sorafenib is an orally administered small
molecule target drug for BCLC C-stage. This updated systemic review and meta-analysis focuses on identifying the
efficacy of the combination of TACE with sorafenib, which remains controversial despite years of exploration.
Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus and the Cochrane Library were systematically reviewed to search for studies
published from January 1990 to May 2017. Studies focusing on the efficacy of combination therapy for unresectable
HCC were eligible. The hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for time to progression (TTP),
overall survival (OS), disease control rate (DCR) and aetiology were collected. The data were then analysed through
fixed/random effects meta-analysis models with STATA 13.0. The incidence and severity of treatment-related
adverse events (AEs) were also evaluated.
Results: Twenty-seven studies were included. Thirteen non-comparative studies reported median OS (ranging from
18.5 to 20.4 months), median TTP (ranging from 7 to 13.9 months) and DCR (ranging from 18.4 to 95%). Fourteen
comparative studies provided median OS (ranging from 7.0 to 29.7 months) and median TTP (ranging from 2.6 to
10.2 months). Five comparative studies provided DCR (ranging from 32 to 97.2%). Forest plots showed that
combination therapy significantly improved TTP (HR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.50–0.81, P = 0.002) rather than OS (HR = 0.63,
95% CI 0.55–0.71, P = 0.058), compared to TACE alone. DCR increased significantly in the combination therapy
group (OR = 2.93, 95% CI 1.59–5.41, P = 0.005). Additional forest plots were drawn and no significant differences
were observed with regard to survival outcome among various aetiologies. Forest plots for separate analysis of
regions showed the HR for TTP was 0.62 (95% CI 0.45–0.79, P = 0.002) in the Asian countries group, and 0.82
(95% CI 0.59–1.05, P = 0.504)) in western countries. The HR for OS was 0.61 (95% CI 0.48–0.75, P = 0.050) in the
Asian countries group and was 0.88 (95% CI 0.56–1.20, P = 0.845) in western countries. These data may indicate
positive TTP outcome in Asian patients but not in European patients while no positive findings regarding OS were
observed in either region. The most common AEs included fatigue, hand-foot skin reaction, diarrhoea and hypertension.

Conclusions: Combination therapy may benefit unresectable HCC patients in terms of prolonged TTP and DCR. More
well-designed studies are needed to investigate its superiority for OS.
Keywords: Hepatocellular carcinoma, Transarterial chemoembolization, Sorafenib, Systemic review, Meta-analysis
Background
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common liver
malignancy. Causing approximate 700,000 deaths per year
around the world, it is the third leading cause of cancer
death and the fifth most common malignancy globally [1].
Furthermore, Asian countries contribute a large proportion
of global HCC, making it a heavy burden in the Asia-Pacific
region [2].
Currently, the most widely perceived staging system
for HCC is the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC)
system, which integrates prognostic classification and
corresponding treatment of HCC. According to the
BCLC system, very early and early-stage HCC (BCLC 0
or A) should be treated with curative modalities [3–5],
whereas BCLC B and C HCC classified as unresectable
HCC should be considered for transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and sorafenib, respectively [1].
Previous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown
that TACE can bring survival benefits to unresectable HCC
patients [1]. However, the high recurrence rate after TACE
treatment is a major limitation of conventional TACE
(c-TACE), possibly resulting from increased expression of
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and
vplatelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Repeated TACE may
cause liver function deterioration [6]. Fortunately, as an inhibitor of many kinases, sorafenib can reduce proliferation
and angiogenesis of tumour cells, increasing tumour apoptosis by inhibiting VEGF and PDGF receptors [7]. Therefore,
combining sorafenib with TACE may be a promising strategy
to reduce the recurrence rate of disease and improve the
treatment efficacy compared to TACE mono-therapy [2].
Several clinical trials have evaluated survival outcomes
in HCC patients who received combination therapy, but
the findings differed greatly among studies and thus remain debatable. It remains a pending issue as to whether
TACE plus sorafenib enhances TACE efficacy and improves survival. This updated meta-analysis aimed to analyse relevant clinical trials in recent years as much as
possible (including comparative and non-comparative trials) to evaluate the efficacy of combination therapy used
for unresectable HCC patients and ascertain the benefits
of combination therapy.
Methods
Identification and eligibility of relevant studies
To cover as much of the relevant literature as possible, we
comprehensively searched PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus and
the Cochrane Library for studies published from January
1990 to May 2017. Search terms were as follows: “transarterial chemoembolization” or “chemoembolization” or “TACE”
AND “hepatocellular carcinoma” or “hematoma” or “HCC”
or “liver cancer” or “liver tumour” AND “sorafenib”. The references of retrieved articles were also screened. The search
was limited to English articles involving only adult patients.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Inclusion criteria
Studies that focused on combination therapy of sorafenib
plus TACE in unresectable HCC were included. Studies
were limited to English articles and adult patients. Necessary information included overall survival (OS), time to
progression (TTP), disease control rate (DCR), adverse
events (AEs) and tumour response.
Exclusion criteria
Studies that compared efficacy of combination therapy
versus sorafenib alone were excluded. Non-English studies or comments, editorials, letters, case reports, reviews
and meta-analyses were not considered. Studies unrelated to our topic or lacking useful information were also
excluded.
Definitions and standardization
Two types of TACE were analysed in our meta-analysis,
including conventional TACE (c-TACE) and TACE with
drug-eluting beads (DEB-TACE). Treatments including
TACE before or after sorafenib were both defined as
combination therapies. Patients should receive at least
one session of TACE during their treatment.
TTP was defined as the time from initial treatment to
tumour progression or last follow-up. OS was defined as
the time from first TACE to the date of death or last
follow-up. DCR was defined as the combination of
complete response rate, partial response rate and stable
disease rate.
Data extraction
After initial identification of articles from databases, two
researchers (Lin Li, Wenzhuo Zhao) screened studies
according to the abovementioned criteria by reading titles
and abstracts. At each screening step, the number of studies and the reasons for exclusion were recorded. Subsequently, the full-text of articles eligible for inclusion were
independently assessed and necessary information was
Li et al. BMC Gastroenterology (2018) 18:138 Page 2 of 13

extracted, including baseline characteristics, treatment
strategy, OS, TTP, DCR, AEs, HR and tumour responses.
Finally, all available data were pooled and analysed. Disagreements between the two researchers were discussed
until consensus was reached.
Statistical analysis
Meta-analysis was performed by STATA 13.0 according
to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of
Interventions. The quality of included RCT studies was
assessed by the Jadad scale [8], while non-RCT studies
were assessed by the methodological index for
non-randomized studies (MINORS) [9]. HR and 95% CI
of TTP, OS, DCR, as well as aetiology of various studies
were collected. I2 analysis was used to assess the heterogeneity among studies. If the I2 value was less than 50%,
a fixed-effects meta-analysis model was conducted, and
if the I2 value was not less than 50% the random-effects
meta-analysis model was performed. For all outcomes, a
P-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
Results
Identification of eligible studies
After searching the literature within several databases, a
total of 1551 studies were eventually identified for
screening. According to titles and abstracts, 1507 studies
were excluded, and the full texts of the remaining 44 articles were examined. Finally, 27 studies were included
in our analysis, with 14 comparative studies and 13
non-comparative studies. The screening flowchart of the
study is shown in Fig. 1.
Study characteristics
The 13 non-comparative studies published from 2009
to 2016 included 8 phase-II studies, 2 phase-I studies
and 3 retrospective studies (Table 1). C-TACE was
used in 9 studies, and DEB-TACE was used in 4 studies. Seven of the thirteen studies were conducted in
Asia. The number of patients per study ranged from
14 to 222. All patients in 13 non-comparative studies
were graded as either Child-Pugh (CP) class A or B,
among which most patients (65–94%) were at CP A.
The proportion of patients at BCLC B stage was 20–
100% and there were 1.9–80% at BCLC C stage. The
ECOG performance status was reported to be 0 or 1
(94–100%). Eleven studies provided aetiology information about the patients. The total rates of hepatitis
viral infection ranged from 24 to 100%. The detailed
baseline characteristics of patients, duration of sorafenib and the number of TACE sessions (ranging from
1 to 3) are displayed in Table 1.
Fourteen comparative studies enrolled 1689 patients in
total, including 3 RCTs, 4 non-randomized controlled
studies and 7 retrospective studies (Table 2). C-TACE
was used in 11 studies and DEB-TACE was used in 3
studies. The proportions of patients at BCLC B and C
stages were 15–100% and 38–100%, respectively. The

ECOG Performance Status was 0 or 1 (71–100%). For
aetiology, HBV (hepatitis B virus)/HCV (hepatitis C
virus) infection rates varied greatly. Patients in the
Asian-Pacific region were mostly infected with HBV,
while Japanese and European countries had more HCV
infections. In 13 comparative studies, patients were
TACE-responsive before sorafenib administration. Some
patients in the study of Ohki et al. were unresponsive to
TACE. Detailed procedures in treatment of each study
are also provided in Table 2.
Tumour response, DCR, TTP, OS
Non-comparative studies
In terms of the assessment of tumour response, six studies applied the response evaluation in solid tumours
(RECIST) and 6 studies applied the modified RECIST
(mRECIST). Eleven studies reported DCR ranging from
18.4 to 95%. Six studies reported median TTP ranging
from 7 to 13.9 months. Four studies reported median
OS ranging from 12 to 20.4 months (Additional file 1:
Table S1).
Comparative studies
DCR In 14 comparative studies, five studies reported
DCR in combined groups ranging from 32 to 97.2%
(Additional file 2: Table S2). For all five studies, DCR
in the combination therapy group was substantially
higher than those in the TACE alone group. The forest plot showed that the increase of DCR in combination therapy was significant (OR = 2.93, 95% CI
1.59–5.41, P = 0.005).
TTP Ten studies provided TTP with a median ranging from 2.6 to 10.2 months. Nine studies provided
available HR for TTP (Table 3). The forest plot
showed that the overall HR for TTP was 0.66 (95%
CI 0.50–0.81, P = 0.002), indicating that combination
therapy significantly prolonged TTP. The analysis was
performed in a random effect model and the I2 was
66.4% (Fig. 2). To minimize heterogeneity, TTP in
Asia-Pacific and Western studies were separately analysed by the sub-analysis of forest plots. The forest
plot showed that the HR for TTP in Asian countries
was 0.62 (95% CI 0.45–0.79, P = 0.002) and was 0.82
(95% CI 0.59–1.05, P = 0.504) in western countries
(Fig. 3). These data may indicate positive TTP outcome of statistical significance in Asian countries. Regions may show differences in survival outcome
through various factors.
OS Ten studies reported median OS ranging from 7.0
to 29.7 months, while HR of OS was available in 8 studies (Table 4). The forest plot indicated that the overall
HR for OS was 0.63 (95% CI 0.55–0.71, P = 0.058), suggesting that combination therapy may not significantly
improve OS. The analysis was performed in a fixed effect model and the I2 was 48.7% (Fig. 4). The subgroup
analysis according to different region was also performed, and the HR for OS was 0.61 (95% CI 0.48–
0.75, P = 0.050) in Asian countries and was 0.88 (95%
CI 0.56–1.20, P = 0.845) in western countries (Fig. 5),
without statistical significance across different regions.
Relationship between aetiology and survival outcome
Four studies provided HR of aetiology for OS, and 3
studies provided HR for TTP (Table 5). Using random
effect models, the forest plots indicated that the
overall HR of aetiology for OS was 1.10 (0.78–1.41,
P = 0.888) (Additional file 3: Figure S1), and the
overall HR for TTP was 0.88 (0.72–1.05, P = 0.565)
(Additional file 4: Figure S2). We may deduce that
the aetiology of HCC might not have significant influence on survival outcome.

Adverse events
AEs of combination therapy included fatigue, diarrhoea,
nausea, hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR), haematological
events, alopecia, hepatotoxicity, hypertension and rash
(Additional file 5: Table S3). Among these, the incidence
of HFSR was highest. Most patients experienced at least
one type of sorafenib-related AE during drug administration. Most AEs were mild to moderate and could be
controlled through appropriate management, including
temporary dose reduction or another syndrome-relieving
treatment. The incidence of severe AEs, such as hepatic
failure or gastrointestinal haemorrhage, was very low.
No treatment-related deaths and disabilities occurred in
these studies.
Discussion
Several clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate
the efficacy of combination therapy. Our systematic
review and meta-analysis collected the updated studies that evaluated the efficacy of combination therapy
for unresectable HCC. The studies were published
during the past 8 years, including comparative and
non-comparative trials. The comprehensive analysis of
27 studies indicated that combination therapy may
have significant superiority over TACE mono-therapy
in terms of TTP but not OS.
As the first globally randomized controlled trial
with a relatively large sample size, the SPACE trial
(sorafenib or placebo in combination with TACE for
intermediate-stage HCC) conducted by Lencioni et al.
showed no significant difference of TTP between the
combination therapy group and the TACE alone
group [10]. Later, many clinical trials conducted in
different countries also evaluated the efficacy of
combination treatment, and most reported findings
that combination therapy was more effective than
mono-therapy in terms of TTP. Among 14 comparative studies that we analysed, most studies concluded
that, compared with TACE alone, combination treatment with TIPS followed by sorafenib increased the
TTP in patients unresponsive to TACE [11–14].
Kudo et al. found the outcomes of clinical trials varied
across different races and regions. For Japanese patients,
the HR for TTP was 0.94 (95% CI, 0.75–1.19), while for
Korean patients it was 0.38 (95% CI, 0.18–0.81), suggesting that the Korean patients may benefit more from
combination therapy than Japanese patients [15]. Compared with other Asian countries, Japanese HCC patients

had higher HCV infection rates. However, our analysis
between aetiology and survival showed no significant
difference. Studies have shown that the mechanism of
HCC caused by HBV and HCV is different [16], and
pathological manifestations and gene expression differ
between HBV- and HCV-related HCC [17, 18]. In terms
of tumour survival and prognosis, some studies found
significantly better survival and smaller recurrence
rates in HCV-related HCC than with HBV-related HCC
[19, 20]. In contrast, other studies showed that the
prognosis of HCV-related HCC patients was worse
than that of HBV-related HCC patients [21]. This might
be a potential reason for our negative finding, since the
proportion of HCV-related HCC patients in the 27
studies included in this analysis was small.
The survival rate in the Asian-Pacific region was lower
than that of European countries. In particular, the mortality rate of Chinese patients was higher than the average value of other regions in the world. Our analysis of
regions showed that the TTP outcome in the Asian
group was positive, while the European group returned a
negative result. In another analysis, both groups showed
a negative OS outcome. However, regions show differences through many factors. Take treatment procedure
for example; in SPACE trials, there was a greater improvement in TTP and OS HRs in patients from Asian
countries than from non-Asian countries. Because
non-Asian patients in the sorafenib arm discontinued
TACE treatments earlier and had a shorter duration of
sorafenib, both factors may have contributed to the outcome difference and may have caused bias [10].
Well-designed studies, regular drug administration and
good control of confounding factors are needed to reflect the real efficacy of combination therapy.
C-TACE is performed by the injection of a mixture of
a chemotherapeutic drugs and lipiodol, which block
feeding vessels, and thus cause tumour necrosis [22].
DEB-TACE releases chemotherapeutic agents from
micro-beads, facilitating further, more effective and
more focused embolization [23, 24]. However, compared
with C-TACE, it appears that DEB-TACE shows similar
clinical outcomes with fewer adverse events. In terms of
efficacy, whether DEB-TACE is superior to C-TACE remains debatable [25, 26].
Although there were no positive findings regarding
OS in the meta-analysis, this does not necessarily
suggest that combination therapy was not futile for
improving the survival time of HCC patients. Many

clinical trials also have shown that combination therapy can prolong OS [4, 6, 11–13]. The heterogeneity
of patients’ physical conditions may be the primary
factor affecting OS, as candidate selection may make
a difference. Various study designs, including treatment procedure, number of TACE and duration of
sorafenib administration might also have an effect on
the outcome. In this case, reasonable study design, including proper candidate selection and appropriate
treatment administration, are of great concern [6].
Lead time bias is another factor that may have impact
on survival outcome. Lead time means the interval by
which the disease was diagnosed by screening in advance
[27]. It might create bias in observational studies of
screening efficacy and may affect the comparison of
overall survival among various studies [28]. However,
the BCLC staging system might have made a relatively
clear classification for HCC. Currently, most clinical trial
designs use inclusion criteria based on BCLC stage, possibly helping to reduce this bias to some degree.
Some studies that included HCC patients with portal
vein invasion have shown that combination therapy
was more effective than TACE alone in terms of TTP
and OS [29, 30]. However, other studies suggested
negative efficacy that combination therapy brought for
HCC patients with portal vein invasion [7, 14]. The
extent of portal vein invasion may make difference to
the survival effects. Moreover, promising OS of combined therapy with worse baseline condition may be
attributed to incorporate administered systemic therapy and loco-regional treatments [30]. Another study
focusing on combination efficacy between elderly and
non-elderly patients concluded that age was not a
prognostic factor for treatment outcome in advanced
HCC patients [11, 31].
In terms of AEs, the study by Yao et al. found that
combination therapy induced greater AEs than did
TACE mono-therapy [32]. According to the final analysis of the START trials, combination therapy did
not appear to lead to worse AEs. Moreover, the presence of some AEs such as HFSR indicated positive
correlation with anti-tumour efficacy [15].
The major potential limitations of the present study
are as follows: First, the number of studies included in
this meta-analysis was relatively large, with half being
non-comparative — the heterogeneity of available data
from these studies was correspondingly substantial. The
funnel plots also showed potential publication bias. Second, only several studies conducted OS and TTP analysis.
The detailed information available for meta-analysis was
limited. Third, the retrospective nature, small sample size,
non-randomized study design and the various treatment
procedures may increase the uncertainty of the
conclusions.
Conclusions
As a meta-analysis which included a large number of
studies, overall results of this systematic review and
meta-analysis suggest that the combination of sorafenib
plus TACE was superior to TACE alone in terms of TTP
but not OS. Nevertheless, combination therapy is still effective and promising. This study not only analysed the
relationship between combination therapy and survival
efficacy to clarify this controversial issue, but also provided conclusions that aetiological differences may not
influence survival outcomes. Separated regions analysis
contributed to less heterogeneity while other similar
studies currently lack such analysis. In the future,
well-designed, randomized-controlled, prospective trials
with optimized study designs and large sample sizes are
required.
