Review Article
Context: On the strength of epidemiological data,biological studies, and clinical findings, hepatitis C virus appears to be involved in the pathogenesis of a proportion of patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and cryoglobulinemia.
Objectives: The aim of this paper is to review the published literature focused on the current knowledge concerning hepatitis C virus and its potential role in the production of 
non-Hodgkin lymphoma and cryoglobulinemia in susceptible individuals.
Evidence Acquisition: In this review, databases such as pubMed, embase, ISI, and Iranian 
databases including Iranmedex, and SID were searched.
Results: The results of this review indicate that HCV infection may be a likely cause of 
various B cell dysregulation disorders such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma and cryoglobulinemia. 
Conclusion: Based on current findings, it has been hypothesized that NHL and cryoglobulinemia in HCV infection may have an immune-mediated pathogenesis. In HCV infected 
patients, we showed an elevated risk of these two diseases. These finding suggested a 
possible role for chronic hepatitis C in the pathogenesis of NHL and cryoglobulinemia.

1. Context
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) appears to be the virus that is 
usually associated with profound alterations in the host 
immune system, resulting in immunological abnormalities and some autoimmune disease (1-3). It has been 
proposed that HCV infects and replicates in not only 
hepatocytes but also immune cells, such as B cells. HCV 
infection of B cells is the possible cause of B cell dysregulation diseases and conditions, including mixed cryoglobulinemia (MC), rheumatoid factor (RF) production, 
and B cell lymphoproliferative disorders that may progress to non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (4). Interestingly, 
some patients develop low-grade lymphoma, composed 
of B cells that are immunophenotypically identical to the 
expanded B cells that are observed in cryoglobulinemia 
(5). Most of the extrahepatic manifestations (EHMs) of 
HCV infection are associated with autoimmune or lymphoproliferative states and are thought to be immunemediated. Patients with chronic hepatitis C infection 
(CHC) usually have immunological characteristics, such 
as circulating autoantibodies and deposits of immune 
complexes (ICs) in various tissues other than the liver, 
which may be an important pathogenic mechanism of 
extrahepatic disorders in the course of HCV infection (6). 
HCV also appears to be capable of directly infecting cells 
around the liver—a feature that may play an important 
role in determining some EHMs.
This hypothesis is supported by observations of HCV 
replication in extrahepatic tissues, such as bone marrow, 
the central nervous system, endocrine glands, lymph

nodes, spleen, monocytes, macrophages, and skin cells. 
Moreover, there is some epidemiological evidence of relationship between chronic HCV infection and some of 
these EHMs (7-9). To date, the pathogenic mechanisms by 
which HCV acts as an instigator of B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders are not fully explained—the exact mechanisms by which B cells become dysregulated during the 
course of chronic HCV infection are not known. Difficulties in identifying disease mechanisms presumably stem 
from several issues, such as the wide heterogeneity of 
disease complications. Moreover, factors affecting the 
development of the disease may be related to the host, 
the virus, and the environment (10).The purpose of this 
study was to review the literature concerning the association between HCV infection, cryoglobulinemia, and 
NHL.
2. Evidence Acquisition
2.1. Cryoglobulinemia
Cryoglobulins are immunoglobulins (Igs) that precipitate in the cold and are classified into three groups, 
based on Ig clonality (11-14). Type I cryoglobulins are 
usually associated with lymphoproliferative disorders, 
including multiple myeloma and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, and usually consist of monoclonal Ig or 
a light chain. Type II cryoglobulins are composed of a 
polyclonal IgG and a monoclonal IgM RF reacting against 
the Fc portion of the IgG; it is identified as essential MC. 
It is believed that most of these essential MC are associated with CHC. Type III MC is also specified by RF activity, 
although polyclonal IgG and polyclonal IgM exist. There 
is a well-established link between type I cryoglobulinemia and well-known hematological diseases. This type of 
cryoglobulinemia is usually asymptomatic per se; similarly, circulating mixed cryoglobulins are commonly 
identified in a large number of infectious or systemic diseases (15). The first report indicating an association between HCV and cryoglobulinemia was published in 1990 
(16). However, the number of cases of cryoglobulinemia 
associated with HCV reported annually has risen considerably. The incidence of HCV infection in MC ranges from 
40% to 90% and varies geographically (17, 18). MC can be 
observed in up to 60% of HCV-infected patients, although 
nearly 5% to 20% of these patients develop overt cryoglobulinemic syndrome (19). This prominent association rate 
represents a causative link between HCV and MC (20).
However, HCV seems to play a prominent etiological 
role in the disease, especially in the Mediterranean area. 
Patients with HCV-negative MC are more frequently identified in the same areas where the overall prevalence of 
the disease is considerably low and where its relation 
with HCV is less common. These patients may represent 
true ‘essential’ MC (17, 21). Further evidence of an association between HCV infection and cryoglobulinemia has 
been provided by recent findings relating the presence 
of HCV RNA in the serum and/or peripheral mononuclear cells of patients with type II essential MC (22, 23). HCV 
antigens are detected within the ICs that precipitate in 
many organs, including the skin and kidneys of HCV-infected patients with MC—additional evidence in humans 
of a link between cryoglobulinemia and HCV infection 
(17).
2.2. phatophysiology of HCV-Related Cryoglobulinemia
HCV infection of peripheral lymphocytes suggests that 
this virus could be the stimulating factor for the lymphoproliferation that underlies MC. The mechanisms 
responsible for the clonal amplification of autoantibody-producing B cells and chronic lymphoproliferation 
in HCV infection remain controversial. Nonetheless, it 
has now become obvious that HCV has high tropism for 
peripheral lymphocytes, which may act as its reservoir 
and a site of replication (24). On B cells, CD81, which is 
part of a complex formed by CD21, CD19, and Leu13, lowers the threshold for B-cell activation. Flint et al. showed 
that HCV attaches to the CD81 ligand tetraspanin on the 
surface of B-lymphocytes through E2 protein (the second 
portion of the HCV envelope), resulting in activation of 
these lymphocytes (25). Thus, the CD81 molecule is an 
HCV receptor, and HCV infection of B cells is the possible 
cause of different disorders of B cell dysregulation, including MC and RF production (26).
It has also been shown that isolated intrahepatic B 
lymphocytes are able to spontaneously secrete RFs that 
usually exhibit the WA crossreactive idiotype. The occurrence of oligoclonal or monoclonal patterns indicates that B cells derived from very few or single cells 
expand within the liver. It is also possible that initially, 
only polyclonal cryoglobulins are produced, after which 
a dominant B-cell clone emerges, synthesizing monoclonal Igs (27, 28). Therefore, expansion of autoantibodyproducing B-cells, due to dysregulation of anti-idiotype 
networks, may be one of the possible mechanisms for 
disease induction. Molecular mimicry represents another potential mechanism of B-lymphocyte activation 
and autoantibody production. For example, it seems 
that molecular mimicry between HCV antigens, such 
as NS5A and HCV core proteins and host autoantigens, 
triggers activation of B-lymphocytes and autoantibody 
production (29). Furthermore, the involvement of ICs 
has been suggested in the pathogenesis of disease. Various autoantibodies, including RF and cryoglobulins, are 
important in the formation of ICs (30). Moreover, the 
importance of the complement system must not be forgotten, because complement components that may be 
generated in the course of an infection are involved in 
the immune complex-mediated reactions. This system is 
highly activated in cryoglobulinemic patients (31), and efficient engagement of C1q protein by cryoglobulins may 
be the chief pathogenetic mechanism involved in the 
cryoglobulin-related pathway (32). There is no doubt that 
dysregulation of helper T cells and their cytokines aids 
in the production of autoantibodies, such as cryoglobulins. Nonetheless, there is some controversy concerning 
the pattern of cytokines in patients with HCV and cryo-

globulinemia. On one hand, Atta et al. verified that HCV 
carriers with cryoglobulinemia have increased serum 
levels of IL-5, a Th2 cell-derived cytokine (33). Therefore, 
it is possible that Th2 responses that promote autoantibody production may responsible for the pathology of 
the disease. On the other hand, Saadoun et al. indicated 
that T cells from the liver of HCV-MC vasculitis patients 
display a significantly augmented liver Th1 profile compared to MC-negative controls (34). Therefore, further 
experiments are needed to clarify the role of Th1/Th2 
cytokines in the pathogenesis of the disease. Genetic factors also appear to play a role in the disease (35). The high 
incidence of the disease among Mediterranean people 
and the association of certain human leukocyte antigen 
(HLA) specificities or alleles with disease have provided 
additional supports for this possibility. It seems that 
HLA type II polymorphisms, by interacting with T-cells, 
may influence the production of cryoglobulins (36, 37). 
In recent years, cryoglobulinemia has been a substantial focus, because it has become clear that cryoproteins 
may provoke signs and symptoms more often than previously identified. Mixed cryoglobulinemia symptoms 
(MCS) manifest in 10, 15% to 30% of MC patients and in 5, 
10% of all HCV-infected subjects (38). Due to the diverse 
clinical pictures, the presentation of MCS may significantly differ in various cases and in the same subject at 
various times. These clinical manifestations rely on the 
underlying disease; the dominant lesion of this disease 
is immune-mediated vasculitis. It may occur as a result 
of intravascular IC deposition in many organs, including 
skin, kidney, and peripheral nerves (22, 39, 40). Other frequent symptoms of MCS are weakness, arthralgias, and 
palpable purpura that usually first develops in the lower 
extremities (41). Further signs may include Raynaud phenomenon, peripheral neuropathy, sicca syndrome, and 
membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), as 
well as lung disorders, fever, hematocytopenia, and diffuse vasculitis (42-44). The optimal therapeutic strategy 
for HCV-associated MC is based on both antiviral and limited immunosuppressive therapy with regard to activity 
and severity of the underlying vasculitis and the status of 
the underlying infection (45). IFN-α and ribavirin (RBV) 
are powerful antiviral drugs and can improve many of 
the clinical manifestations of MC, including skin vasculitis and renal disease (40). In spite of its remarkable therapeutic properties, IFN-α may have unwanted effects. For 
instance, Beuthien et al. introduced a case of a chronic 
HCV-infected patient who did not demonstrate signs of 
vasculitis or neuropathy before starting IFN therapy. This 
patient presented with cryoglobulinemic vasculitis with 
rigorous peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy following 
a virologic response that had been induced by antiviral 
treatment with pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and RBV 
(46). In addition, deterioration of vasculitis in patients 
with cryoglobulins without any new onset of vasculitis 
has been described (47). This observation has been confirmed by other studies (48). As a result, it is important 
for clinicians to be aware of these potentially severe side 
effects.
2.3. Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
In 1958, Denis Burkitt recognized a new type of lymphoma in Uganda, which was named Burkitt lymphoma (49). 
In 1966, a classification of lymphoid neoplasms was proposed by Rappaport. He subsumed these cases under the 
term “NHL” (49). This disease is the most common cancer of the lymphatic system and is broadly divided into 
several subtypes, based on the predominant cell type of 
the tumor (50). The exact cause of NHL is unknown, but 
it appears that the disease is related to many risk factors, 
such as:
Certain conditions that can also weaken the immune 
system, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, 
and immunosuppressive medications, particularly after 
transplants (50).
Exposure to certain viruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus, 
human T-lymphotropic virus type 1, human immunodeficiency virus, HCV, and certain bacteria, such as Helicobacter pylori (50, 51).
Family history of NHL—for example, having a sibling 
with the disease (though no hereditary pattern has been 
established) (52).
Exposure to chemicals, such as pesticides and solvents 
(53)
A possible association between HCV infection and B-cell 
NHL (B-NHL) was first reported in 1994 in Italy (54). The 
results of this study demonstrated a significant increase 
in the prevalence of HCV in a group of NHL patients (34%) 
compared with controls (1%). Subsequently, an association between HCV infection and B-NHL has also been 
noted by several epidemiological studies, indicating a 
high prevalence of HCV infection in B-NHL, ranging between 3.6% and 37% (55, 56). Similarly, the high prevalence 
of HCV infection in patients with B lymphoma provides 
further support of the link between HCV infection and 
B-cell NHL (57). Additionally, there is a consistent association between HCV and MC. Chronic infection with HCV 
correlates with MC type II, which can progress into overt 
lymphoma in some patients (58). In light of these data, 
a strong relationship between NHL and HCV infection is 
implicated, which may be associated with extra-nodal 
involvement (especially salivary glands and liver), splenomegaly, lymphocytosis, cryoglobulins, cytolysis, and 
colestasis (59-61). The treatment strategy for HCV-associated NHL is similar to that of conventional lymphoma 
(62). Among these therapeutic methods, which may be 
implemented alone or in combination, immunotherapy 
is a newer approach. Several immunotherapeutic methods have been proposed in clinical trials, and studies 
have indicated that IFN treatment is generally well tolerated (63). With respect to NHL as an EHM of HCV infection, IFN-α appears to be an effective treatment (63, 64). 
The response to IFN therapy for chronic hepatitis C has 
been improved tremendously with the use of RBV and 
PEG-IFN (63). However, some patients do not respond to 
this therapy, and several factors can contribute to unre-

88

sponsiveness, including the characteristics of the virus, 
the subject who has been infected, and the therapy (63). 
In addition, IFN treatment has side effects. These unwanted effects can be divided into acute effects (such as 
fever, chill and rigors, headaches, myalgias, and malaise) 
that decline over time and those that are chronic (including fatigue, anorexia, neuropsychiatric symptoms) (65). 
Although antiviral therapy is an attractive therapeutic 
tool, a better understanding of the biology of IFN, its 
side effect profiles, and toxicity management will help to 
optimize its application in the treatment of HCV-related 
NHL patients.
2.4. Pathophysiology of HCV-Related NHL
The possibility of a pathogenic link between HCV and 
NHL has been strengthened by the finding of HCV antigens in tissues from patients with NHL (66), although the 
pathogenic mechanisms through which the virus induce 
clonal proliferation and transformation of B-cells are not 
known. A recent retrospective study has shown that HCV 
is associated with NHL, as well as other B cell lymphoproliferative disorders, such as Waldenström macroglobulinemia and monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (67). Moreover, despite evidence of the presence 
of HCV in malignant cells (68, 69), HCV viremia has been 
reported in up to 35% of patients with B cell lymphoma 
and nearly 90% of NHL patients with cryoglobulinemia 
(42). The data also indicate that extrahepatic manifestations of HCV infection, such as high serum levels of RF activity, cryoglobulins, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, and frank B-cell NHL, are virtually 
always associated with B-cell clonalities, which may have 
a direct impact on clinical features (70). Further evidence 
to support the hypothesis that HCV is directly involved in 
the emergence and maintenance of B-cell expansion has 
been provided by a demonstration of HCV enrichment in 
intrahepatic inflammatory infiltrates (35). This result is 
consistent with observations that HCV infects and may 
replicate in B cells (71-75) and lead to malignant transformation. However, this model can not describe the RF restriction that is seen in HCV MC, unless it is assumed HCV 
preferentially infects RF+ B cells. Nonetheless, a B cell line 
that productively releases infectious HCV has been demonstrated (74), and several groups have detected a negative HCV strand, a viral replicative intermediate, associated with lymphocytes from HCV+ patients (23, 76, 77). 
Alternatively, it has been proposed that specific HCV proteins are essential for clonal B cell expansion. This suggestion is strengthened by the following considerations:
-IgG Fc binding activity of HCV core (78), which could 
result in enhanced HCV-IC generation.
-Abrogation of p53-induced apoptosis by the NS5A protein of HCV (79)
-Elevated expression of activation-induced cytidine deaminase in CHC B cells after E2-CD81 interaction.
Cytidine deaminase is also expressed in B-NHL patients 
(80-82) and may be required for germinal center-derived 
lymphomagenesis (83). The E2-CD81 interaction could 
enhance the frequency of VDJ rearrangements in antigen-reactive B-cells (84-86), with possible Bcl-2 proto-oncogene activation (84, 85). Bcl-2 acts as an anti-apoptotic 
molecule, and its activation may be associated with the 
t (14;18) chromosomal translocation. Interestingly, this 
translocation has been observed repeatedly in B-cells 
of HCV-infected individuals, particularly in those with 
type t MC (84, 87), and could lead to abnormal B-cell 
survival (87). The extended survival of these highly selected B-cell clones may be related to the overexpression 
of genes (such as CCND1 and CCND2) in CHC B cells. This 
is an important finding, because enhanced expression 
of CCND, which changes cell cycle progression, has been 
frequently observed in different tumors and may participate in tumorigenesis (88, 89). Additionally, CCND2 
is known to be expressed at constitutively high levels in 
B-NHL patients (90) and thus may be associated with Blymphomagenesis. Recent findings also suggest that B 
cell survival that occurs in HCV MC (91-94) may be related 
to the elevated levels of B cell-activating factor. This molecule is a member of the tumor necrosis factor family 
and may play a role in the survival of autoreactive B cells. 
3. Results
Since cryoglobulin production is associated with B lymphocyte expansion, it is possible that B-cell NHL may contribute to complications of MC syndrome, usually after 
a long-lasting follow-up period (42). This occurrence, together with the remarkable association between MC and 
HCV infection, suggests a possible association between 
the same virus and ‘idiopathic’ B-cell NHL (56). The latter 
possibility is partly supported by data showing the similarities that are shared by rearranged Ig genes in B cells 
from patients with type II MC and malignant B-cells from 
HCV-positive patients with B-cell NHL (95, 96). Based on 
the facts and interpretations above, it should be noted 
that lymphomathogenesis is a complex and multistep 
process, in which HCV may act as an antigenic trigger in 
addition to other environmental and genetic factors. In 
other words, some investigators believe that one of the 
outcomes of long-term HCV infection is clonal B cell expansion of Ig (cryoglobulin)-secreting lymphocytes. This 
process, which can be regarded as one of the suspected 
environmental factors, in combination with genetic factors, may culminate in a mutational event, with activation of oncogenes, resulting in NHL. 
4. Conclusions
HCV infection has been associated with numerous 
EHMs. The majority of HCV chronically infected patients 
has no hepatic symptoms and may have normal alanine 
transaminase. In other words, sometimes, the importance of EHM is more severe than the hepatic disease 
itself. Therefore, EHMs may be the reason that patients 
seek medical care and thus have a chance to be studied, 
identified, and finally suitably treated. Some of these 
EHMs, such as cryoglobulinemia and NHL, are thought 

89

to be the result of a HCV/B-cell interaction that possibly 
predisposes one to B-cell proliferation and clonal expansion. The antigenic dependence of these B cells is demonstrated by evidence that HCV-related MC and NHL vanish 
after successful management of HCV infection. Whether 
B-cell clonal expansion of a particular specificity take 
places as a consequence of distinct selection is not obvious. The process of B-cell clonal expansion in a milieu 
that is favorable to the immortalization of one particular clone must be elucidated. Predisposing elements for 
transforming events must be recognized.
