Abstract
Purpose Microvascular invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is considered a poor prognostic factor of liver
resection (LR) and liver transplantation (LT), but its significance for lesions within the up-to-7 criteria is unclear.
This study investigated the survival benefit of primary LT
against LR for HCC with microvascular invasion and
within the up-to-7 criteria.
Methods Adult patients who underwent LR or LT as the
primary treatment for HCC were included for study.
Patients with prior local ablation, neoadjuvant systemic
chemotherapy, targeted therapy, positive resection margin,
or metastatic spread were excluded.
Results There were 471 LR patients and 95 LT recipients
(70 with living donor, 25 with deceased donor). Seventyseven (81.1%) LT recipients had HCC within the up-to-7
criteria. Twenty-five (26.3%) LT recipients had HCC with
either macrovascular (n = 4) or microvascular (n = 21)
invasion. The 5-year survival rate was 85.7% for LT
recipients with HCC within the up-to-7 criteria, unaffected
by the presence or absence of vascular invasion (88.2 vs.
85.1%). The rate was comparable with that of LR patients
with HCC without vascular invasion (81.2%, p 0.227), but
far superior to that of LR patients with lesions with vascular invasion (50.0%, p\0.0001). Overall survivals were
compromised by multiple tumors [odds ratio (OR) 1.902,
confidence interval (CI) 1.374–2.633, p = 0.0001], vascular invasion (OR 2.678, CI 1.952–3.674, p\0.0001),
blood transfusion (OR 2.046, CI 1.337–3.131, p = 0.001),
and being beyond the up-to-7 criteria (OR 1.457, CI
1.041–2.037, p = 0.028). LT was a favorable factor for
survival (OR 0.243, CI 0.130–0.454, p\0.0001).
Conclusion Primary LT for HCC with microvascular
invasion and within the up-to-7 criteria doubled the chance
of cure as compared with LR.

Introduction
Vascular invasion is a significantly poor prognostic factor
of surgical liver resection (LR) [1, 2] and liver transplantation (LT) [3, 4] for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Preoperative macrovascular [5] or microvascular [6] invasion has been considered a contraindication to LT. Nevertheless, the presence of microvascular invasion in HCC
LR specimen prompts early LT in some centers [7, 8].
However, with the shortage of deceased donor liver grafts,
when the tumor location is favorable and liver functions
acceptable, LR instead of LT is generally accepted as the
standard treatment. Only when the tumor location is
unfavorable or liver functions compromised, and when the
tumor is within standard criteria, LT is practiced [9, 10].
LT is usually reserved as a salvage treatment for recurrent
HCC after LR [7]. However, salvage LT may carry higher

rates of operative mortality, morbidity, and HCC recurrence [11].
Given the above controversies, it would be useful to
know how significant microvascular invasion is in compromising the long-term survival of LT recipients,
regardless of whether a deceased donor graft or a living
donor graft is used. It is also worthwhile to explore the
survival benefits of primary LT over LR, as proposed by
some groups, for patients with resectable HCC with or
without microvascular invasion [11, 12].
Patients and methods
From July 2000 to the end of June 2009, patients aged
16–65 years who underwent LT or LR as the primary
treatment for HCC were included. Patients who had local
ablative therapies before LT or before or during LR were
excluded. Those who received neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy or targeted therapy and those with positive
resection margin or with direct or metastatic spread of
HCC were also excluded. The date of data access was 31
December 2010.
Selection criteria for liver transplantation
When LT for HCC was started in our center, only HCC
patients who fulfilled the Milan criteria [9] and had no
significant comorbidity were considered as suitable candidates. Because subsequent data suggested that survival
outcomes might not be adversely affected by inclusion of
patients with tumors of a slightly larger size, the indications for LT have been expanded to include HCC patients
within the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF)
criteria (solitary tumor of 6.5 cm, or three nodules with the
largest diameter of 4.5 cm and a total tumor diameter of
8 cm) in recent years [10]. Only since February 2010,
patients listed for deceased donor liver transplantation
(DDLT) with United Network for Organ Sharing stage II
HCC and with no tumor progression over a 6-month period
are granted a Model for End-stage Liver Disease score of
18, and 2 points are added for every 3 months’ wait.
Selection criteria for liver resection
Assessment of the resectability of HCC at our center has
been described in detail previously [13]. In brief, absence
of distant metastasis, anatomically resectable lesion, and
adequate liver function reserve were prerequisites for LR.
Tumor invasion into hepatic veins or the portal vein branch
was not considered a contraindication to LR as reasonable
survival outcome had been reported [14]. Liver function
reserve was evaluated according to the liver biochemistry,
indocyanine green clearance test, and Child–Pugh classification [15]. With more experiences in major LR accumulated during the past decade, we have expanded the
safety limit of major liver resection by shifting the indocyanine green retention rate at 15 min from\14 to\20%
in recent years [16], allowing more cirrhotic patients with
HCC to benefit from LR [17]. Computed tomography
volumetry was used to assess liver remnant volume in
relation to standard liver volume [18, 19]. Right portal vein
embolization was performed in selected child A cirrhotic
patients with a small liver remnant (\30% of the standard
liver volume) before proceeding to extended right liver
resection or right trisectionectomy.
Patient follow-up
After LT or LR, chest radiography and computed tomography of the chest and the liver were performed every
3 months, with a serum alpha-fetoprotein assay to detect
tumor recurrence. Positron-emission tomography or radioisotope bone scintigraphy was used to detect concurrent
extrahepatic metastasis.
Statistical analysis
Data were collected prospectively and entered into a single
computerized database. Survival data were censored on 31
December 2010. All continuous variables were expressed
as median and range, and compared by the Mann–Whitney
U test. Categorical variables were compared by the v2 test.
Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan–Meier
method and compared between groups by the log-rank test.
Hospital death was defined as death after surgery during
the same hospitalization. Survival was defined as the period
from the time of operation to the time of death or time of
data censoring. Deaths from all events were censored. The
up-to-7 criteria [4] [HCC with 7 as the sum of the size (in
cm) of the largest tumor and the number of tumors] were
used for subgroup analyses of LT and LR patients. The data
of tumor size, tumor number, and vascular invasion were
derived from histopathology reports. A p value of \0.05
was considered statistically significant. All statistical
analyses were performed with the computer software SPSS
version 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
Over this 10-year period, 95 primary LTs and 471 primary
LRs performed for HCC fulfilled the inclusion criteria of
this study. The median follow-up time was 58.1 months
(range 0.03–124.29 months) in the LT group and
42.7 months (range 0.03–124.84 months) in the LR group.

Patients on both arms were of comparable age. Both groups
had a male predominance and [85% of patients were
hepatitis B carriers. There were, nonetheless, more hepatitis C carriers in the LT group (11.6 vs. 2.8%, p\0.0001).
The patients who underwent LT had poorer liver functions
as 32.6% of them were classified as Child–Pugh class C
patients while there were no such patients in the LR group
(p\0.0001). The DDLT to living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) ratio was about 1 to 3. Blood transfusion
was required in \10% of the LR patients (Table 1).
The serum alpha-fetoprotein level was lower in the LT
recipients as compared with the LR patients (26 vs.
74 ng ml-1
, p = 0.005). In the LT recipients, the HCCs
were smaller, more often multiple (p = 0.0001), and
bilobar (p = 0.001). Based on explant histopathology, the
majority of these HCCs fulfilled the Milan criteria (n = 63,
66.3%), the UCSF criteria (n = 73, 76.8%), and the up-to7 criteria (n = 77, 81.1%). The proportion of vascular
invasion was lower in the LT group (26.3 vs. 47.3%,
p = 0.0002). Among these 95 recipients, only 4 (4.2%) had
HCC with macrovascular invasion; 2 were within and 2
were beyond the up-to-7 criteria. Tumor stages were also
lower in the LT group (Table 2). The median waiting time
for LT was 60 days (range 1–2,617 days), 217 days in the
DDLT group (range 6–2,617 days), and 38 days in the
LDLT group (range 1–1,473 days). Before LT, 23 patients
had transarterial chemoembolization (DDLT 7/25, 28%;
LDLT 16/70, 22.9%).
The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall (Table 3) and disease-free
(Table 4) survival rates of the LT recipients were superior
to those of the LR patients (94.7, 87.0, and 82.6 vs. 88.5,
71.6, and 58.4%, p\0.0001; and 92.5, 87.0, and 82.6 vs.
63.0, 46.5, and 41.1, p\0.0001, respectively). The 1-, 3-,
and 5-year overall survival rates of LT recipients without
vascular invasion were comparable with those of LT
recipients with vascular invasion (92.9, 88.2, and 84.2 vs.
100, 83.6, and 78.0%, p = 0.325). The survival rates of the
latter group were very acceptable (Fig. 1) and were comparable with those of patients without vascular invasion in
the LR group (95.9, 85.9, and 76.7%, p = 0.912) (Fig. 1).
It is important to note that patients who underwent LR for
HCC with vascular invasion had very poor 1-, 3-, and
5-year overall and disease-free survival rates (80.2, 55.6,
37.8, and 46.4, 26.3, 22.8%, respectively) (Figs. 1, 2,
respectively). The superiority of the 5-year disease-free
survival rates of LT recipients versus LR patients was most
remarkable in the presence of vascular invasion (80.0 vs.
22.8%, p\0.0001) (Fig. 2).
Patients within the up-to-7 criteria
The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival rates of LT recipients with tumor status within the up-to-7 criteria were
satisfactory, irrespective of absence or presence of vascular
invasion (93.3, 89.8, and 85.1 vs. 100, 88.2, and 88.2%,
respectively, p = 0.652), and so were the overall survival
rates of LR patients without vascular invasion (97.8, 91.2,
and 81.2%) as compared with those with vascular invasion
(86.7, 66.5, and 50.0%, p\0.0001). Only half of the LR
patients with vascular invasion achieved 5-year survival
(50.0%) (Fig. 3).
Figure 4 shows that the 1-, 3-, and 5-year disease-free
survival rates of LT recipients with HCC within the up-to-7
criteria were similar to the overall survivals illustrated in
Fig. 3. These were lower in LR patients without and with
vascular invasion (82.3, 69.1, 61.0, and 64.0, 47.1, 41.2%,
respectively). In the presence of vascular invasion, the

5-year disease-free survival rate of LT recipients with
vascular invasion was twice as good as that of LR patients
with vascular invasion (88.2 vs. 41.2%). There was practically no difference between the overall and disease-free
survival rates of LT recipients with HCC within the up-to-7
criteria, irrespective of whether the patients had vascular
invasion.
The causes of death and characteristics of the LT
recipients are listed in Table 5. Only 5 of the 25 recipients
(20%) with vascular invasion and 5 of the 70 recipients
(7.1%) without vascular invasion died from recurrent HCC
(p = 0.072). However, the time to HCC recurrence was
shorter for those with vascular invasion. The courses of
disease of LT recipients with HCC recurrence are shown in
Fig. 5. The ten recipients with HCC recurrence were
treated with LR (n = 1), transarterial chemoembolization
(n = 1), resection of extrahepatic metastasis (n = 3),
radiotherapy (n = 3), or systemic chemotherapy (n = 2).
None of these recipients survived, representing the little
chance of cure and rapid demise for recipients with
recurrence after LT.
Univariable and multivariable analyses of overall
survival
A univariable analysis was performed to identify factors
that adversely affected the overall survival of all LT
recipients, LT recipients within the up-to-7 criteria, all LR
patients, and LR patients within the up-to-7 criteria. Factors with p values \0.2 or a potential correlation with
disease-free survival (gender, comorbid illness, size of the
largest tumor, number of tumor, vascular invasion, tumor
grade, and blood transfusion) were entered into multivariable analysis.

On multivariable analysis, age (OR 0.931, CI
0.874–0.990, p = 0.023) was found to adversely affect the
overall survival of the LT recipients in this cohort. None of
the factors was found to affect the overall survival of LT
recipients within the up-to-7 criteria.
The overall survivals of the LR patients were compromised
by multiple tumors (OR 2.180, CI 1.607–2.958, p\0.0001),
vascular invasion (OR 2.682, CI 1.937–3.714, p\0.0001),
blood transfusion (OR 2.388, CI 1.560–3.655, p\0.0001),
and size of the largest tumor diameter (cm) (OR 1.036, CI
1.005–1.068, p = 0.023). The overall survivals of LR patients
within the up-to-7 criteria were compromised by vascular
invasion (OR 3.196, CI 2.034–5.023, p\0.0001) and blood
transfusion (OR 9.121, CI 3.674–22.640, p\0.0001) after
adjusting for Child–Pugh grade in the model.
A side-by-side comparison of the overall survivals of
patients who underwent LT and LR showed a better survival
of*20% in relation to the up-to-7 criteria for the score of 3–5.
This survival advantage diminished when the score was 6–7
(Fig. 6). It is important to note that it was very remarkable
when the comparison was made between LT recipients and
LR patients with vascular invasion. LR patients beyond the
up-to-7 criteria had dismal 5-year survival rates (Fig. 7). For
patients with HCC within the up-to-7 criteria and with vascular invasion, the 5-year overall survival was not compromised (Fig. 8). Furthermore, only two of these 77 recipients
had macrovascular invasion of HCC (Table 2).
Univariable and multivariable analyses
of disease-free survival
A univariable analysis was also performed using diseasefree survival as an endpoint for all LT recipients, LT
recipients within the up-to-7 criteria, all LR patients, and
LR patients within the up-to-7 criteria. Selection criteria
for the factors accounting for the multivariable disease-free
model were adopted in the same way as for the overall
survival model.
Age (OR 0.927, CI 0.869–0.989, p = 0.021) and size of
the largest tumor (OR 1.146, CI 1.020–1.288, p = 0.022)
were found to be significant in the multivariable analysis of
the disease-free survival of the LT recipients. The diseasefree survival of LT recipients within the up-to-7 criteria
was better for recipients who had blood transfusion (OR
0.240, CI 0.068–0.856, p = 0.028).
The disease-free survival of the LR patients was compromised by multiple tumors (OR 2.141, CI 1.604–2.860,

and being beyond the up-to-7 criteria (OR 1.457, CI

p\0.0001), being beyond the up-to-7 criteria (OR 1.635,
CI 1.257–2.126, p = 0.0002), and blood transfusion (OR
1.676, CI 1.118–2.510, p = 0.012). LT was again a
favorable factor for disease-free survival (OR 0.126, CI
0.068–0.233, p\0.0001).
Discussion
In the 95 recipients who underwent primary LT for HCC,
81% were within the up-to-7 criteria, slightly more than
one-quarter (26.3%) had either macrovascular or microvascular invasion, and approximately three-quarters
(73.7%) underwent LDLT. A 5-year survival rate of[80%
was achieved. Younger age was found to be the sole poor
prognostic factor in overall survival. Younger age and
larger tumor size were found to significantly contribute to
the poorer disease-free survival. With the median age of
55 years taken as the cut-off point, among the 11 recipients
with HCC recurrence, 9 were younger and only 2 were
older than 55 years.
In the 77 recipients who were within the up-to-7 criteria,
the 5-year survival rate improved to 85.7%. In fact, within
the up-to-7 criteria, the absence or presence of either
macro- (n = 2) or micro-vascular (n = 15) invasion was
not important (5-year overall survival rate of 85.1 and
88.2%, respectively). Contrary to the first study reporting
the up-to-7 criteria in which the 5-year survival of recipients with vascular invasion was only 47.4%, we did not
find that the survival was compromised by the presence of
vascular invasion. However, in this large-scale study, the
proportion of recipients with salvage transplantation and
previous LR or ablation was not reported [4]. Within the
up-to-7 criteria, LT recipients with vascular invasion had
survival comparable to that of LR patients without vascular
invasion (88.2 vs. 81.2%, p = 0.854). Remarkably, their
overall survival rates were much better than those of LR
patients with vascular invasion (88.2, 81.2 vs. 50.0%).
Therefore, primary LT has an obvious survival advantage
over primary LR for HCC with vascular invasion.
Vascular invasion
LR for HCC with vascular invasion and microsatellite
nodules is associated with early tumor recurrence. Some

groups proposed early LT after LR when these adverse
features are found in the resection specimen [7, 8]. On the
contrary, HCC with vascular invasion [6, 20] or with high
grade [21, 22] is regarded as contraindication to LT
because of an increased chance of recurrence though this is
not invariable [23].
It has been shown that when there are no more than
three tumors and the tumor size is not larger than 3 cm
each, LT assures very good survival [24]. This was confirmed by Mazzaferro et al. [9]. In their series, no vascular
invasion was found in the explants. However, the incidence
of vascular invasion increases significantly when the tumor
size is[5 cm [21]. Such a single lesion is within the up-to7 criteria and has a score of 6.
In a previous study, the 3-year survival rate of patients
with well to moderately differentiated HCCs not larger
than 5 cm was 82%, and that of patients with poorly differentiated HCCs not larger than 5 cm was 67% [25]. High
histological grade of HCC and macrovascular but not
microvascular invasion were found to be independent
predictors of poorer survival in patients receiving LT for
HCC [26]. It was also shown that microvascular invasion
did not contribute to HCC recurrence after DDLT [10, 27].
Nevertheless, tumor grade was shown to have a correlation
with microvascular invasion [28]. Preoperative tumor
biopsy was proposed [29], and preoperative ultrasoundguided needle biopsy was used to exclude patients with
poorly differentiated HCC from LT [22]. Nevertheless,
biopsy heterogeneity is known to reduce the accuracy of
this management policy [30]. In fact, needle core biopsy
tumor grade often did not correlate with the grade or
presence of microvascular invasion on final pathology of
an explanted native liver [31]. Therefore, with the up-to-7
criteria, the role of HCC biopsy cannot be substantiated.
For patients with Child–Pugh A cirrhosis and HCCs
smaller than 3 cm, LR or ablation offers a good prognosis.
Justification of LDLT is therefore poor [32]. In a study
from Asan Medical Center [33], LR and LT did not cause
any difference in survival for patients with Child–Pugh A
cirrhosis and a single HCC smaller than 3 cm. In the series,
the LR group (n = 100) had a 5-year survival rate of
66.5%, whereas the LT group (n = 17) had the rate at
94.1%, and only 1 of the 17 patients died. This series was
probably underpowered by the small number of recipients
in the LT arm. However, in a series of 101 patients who
underwent LR for multiple HCCs, the overall and diseasefree 5-year survival rates were 39.4 and 15.2%, respectively. The recurrence rate after LR for two HCC lesions
was comparable with that for a single HCC, but a tumor
number of three or more resulted in a higher recurrence
rate. The features of recurrence showed again high incidences of extrahepatic metastasis and vascular invasion,
which reduced the applicability of salvage LT [34]. Poorer
outcomes would be anticipated after salvage LT or bridge
treatment to LT as compared with primary LT [11, 35].
Thus, if there are three or more lesions which meet the
eligibility criteria for LT, it may be beneficial to perform
primary LT. The patient group that carries a high chance of
local recurrence after LR (lesions with microvascular
invasion and within the up-to-7 criteria) and yet a good
chance of cure after LT should be identified. Positronemission tomography has shown a good correlation
between [18] F-FDG positivity and microvascular invasion
[36].
Salvage transplantation
Salvage LT is suitable for *60% of cases [11, 37].
However, in regions with a scarcity of deceased donors, a
salvage transplant usually requires a suitable living donor.
Our center previously showed that of 60 patients suitable
for salvage LT, only 12 (20%) received it [38]. In a previous series, survival after LT was compromised by a high
operative mortality rate of up to 28% and tumor recurrence
rate of 54% [11]. A 5.6% 30-day mortality rate and 61%
5-year survival rate were achieved in another series [7].
Salvage LT is associated with higher operative mortality as
reported by Adam et al. [11], though not in another French
series by Belghiti et al. [7] and the Korean series from
Asan Medical Center [35]. Our bad experience with salvage LT might be due to its application on patients with
treatment failure from LR, a high proportion of patients
with microvascular invasion (8 of 11), and ‘‘fast-track’’ LT.
It is important to note that microvascular invasion, however, did not compromise survival after primary LT in this
study. Aggressive HCC with vascular invasion is perhaps
better tackled by the most radical treatment, namely LT. In
a previous study from our center, the 5-year survival rate
after salvage LT was only 40% and there was no difference
in the rate between patients with recurrence and patients
who received other treatments apart from LT [39]. And in

another study, patients with stage II disease before LR and
recurrence within 1 year had a slightly better 5-year survival rate after LT (49%) [38].
Living donor liver transplantation
Liver transplantation for HCC is often limited by the shortage of deceased donors or absence of suitable living donors.
The high drop-out rate during waiting time, according to an
intention-to-treat analysis, often compromises the survival
of patients having this treatment modality [40]. Current
mathematical models [41] and treatment policies [32] are
based on the fact that there is a shortage of liver grafts for LT.
Thus, primary LR and salvage LT are advocated. Instead of
looking at this at a societal level, for an individual who
intends to undergo LDLT, it is the donor risk that has to be
considered [42]. Nevertheless, this also evades the drop-out
effect of potential recipients on the waiting list as highlighted
by the intention-to-treat analysis [40]. Shortening of the
DDLT waiting list is a secondary benefit. LDLT for HCC
does not bring about worse overall survival [43]. Mortality of
living liver donors is a reality. For right liver donation, the
estimated mortality is 0.5% and for left liver donation, it is
0.1% [44]. The risk–benefit ratio is improved by fivefolds if a
left liver LDLT is feasible.
Limitations of study
In this study, as the comparison of survival was made
between groups and at each of the seven stages and beyond
the up-to-7 criteria, the number of patients in each category
became smaller. It is, however, very important to point out
that if comparison is made of LT and LR with the Milan
criteria, for example, the average size of HCC could well
be 2–3 cm. These lesions can be effectively eradicated by
LR or local ablation, rendering total hepatectomy unnecessary. Thus, the treatment outcomes of lesions reaching or
just beyond the limit of standard criteria are not highlighted
in this study. The pattern of 5-year survivals in this study is
recognizable. The survival rates from LT and LR in relation to the up-to-7 grades initially diverge and then converge. LR patients with HCC and vascular invasion had
poorer overall survival and poorer disease-free survival
even when their up-to-7 criteria scores were low. LT
patients with higher scores had worse survival. Due to the
small number of LR patients with a score beyond 8, the
final convergence of these survival curves cannot be
demonstrated, though the pattern starts to emerge (Figs. 6,
7, 8). Pooling or accumulation of data from multiple centers will empower the study to draw a stronger conclusion.
Patients recruited from a Western center will also help to
clarify if the finding from this study is applicable to regions
with a higher percentage of patients with hepatitis C.
The two groups were not entirely comparable as there
were more patients with bilobar disease in the LT arm who
were not suitable for LR. Nevertheless, this study on primary LT and LR has provided robust data because the
possibility of dissemination of HCC by, for example, local
ablative therapy was excluded.
In conclusion, primary LT for HCC within the up-to-7
criteria irrespective of microvascular invasion results in
satisfactory survival. The chance of survival of patients
with HCC together with microvascular invasion is
improved at least twice if LT instead of LR is adopted as
the primary treatment.
