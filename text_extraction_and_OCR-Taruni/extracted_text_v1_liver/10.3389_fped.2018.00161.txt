Patients with chronic kidney disease are at substantial risk for malnutrition, characterized
by protein energy wasting and micronutrient deficiency. Studies show a high prevalence
rate of malnutrition in both children and adults with chronic kidney disease. Apart from
abnormalities in growth hormone-insulin like growth factor axis, malnutrition also plays a
role in the development of stunted growth, commonly observed in children with chronic
kidney disease. The pathogenic mechanisms of malnutrition in chronic kidney disease
are complex and involve an interplay of multiple pathophysiologic alterations including
decreased appetite and nutrient intake, hormonal derangements, metabolic imbalances,
inflammation, increased catabolism, and dialysis related abnormalities. Malnutrition
increases the risk of morbidity, mortality and overall disease burden in these patients.
The simple provision of adequate calorie and protein intake does not effectively treat
malnutrition in patients with chronic kidney disease owing to the intricate and multifaceted
derangements affecting nutritional status in these patients. A clear understanding of the
pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in the development of malnutrition in chronic
kidney disease is necessary for developing strategies and interventions that are effective,
and capable of restoring normal development and mitigating negative clinical outcomes.
In this article, a review of the pathophysiologic mechanisms of malnutrition in chronic
kidney disease is presented.

deficiency
INTRODUCTION
The American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition defines malnutrition as “an imbalance
between nutrient requirement and intake resulting in cumulative deficits of energy, protein or
micronutrients that may negatively affect growth, development and other relevant outcomes” (1).
This definition assumes a state of undernutrition, which constitutes protein energy wasting and
micronutrient deficiency. For the purposes of this review, the term malnutrition refers to nutrient
deficiency and undernutrition.
Malnutrition is prevalent in both developing and developed countries, and is an important risk
factor for morbidity and mortality. Unlike in developing countries where malnutrition is linked
to poor socioeconomic conditions, malnutrition in the developed countries typically occurs in
the context of acute or chronic illness (1, 2). While acute illness primarily affects weight, chronic
illness impacts linear growth (1). Children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are often stunted
and malnutrition is recognized as a key player in the development of growth failure in this patient
population (3–6). Depending on the clinical parameters used to define malnutrition, a prevalence
of 20–45% has been reported in various studies in children with CKD (6–8). Using the subjective

Iorember Malnutrition in Chronic Kidney Disease
global assessment scale (SGA), a recent study found a
prevalence of protein energy wasting in 31% of adults with
CKD, including dialysis and non-dialysis patients (9). The
clinical parameters used variously to assess nutritional status
in patients with CKD are shown in Table 1. In addition
to growth impairment, malnutrition has also been shown to
increase the risk of morbidity and mortality in both adult
and pediatric patients with CKD (10–12). While malnutrition
in the general population might result from decreased intake,
malnutrition in CKD is not entirely explained by reduced
nutritional intake. A delicate interplay of multiple factors,
including hormonal imbalances, decreased appetite and food
intake, inflammation, increased catabolism, nutrient losses in
dialysate and metabolic derangements predispose chronic kidney
disease patients to malnutrition (13–16). A clear understanding
of the pathophysiologic mechanisms of malnutrition in patients
with CKD is essential to planning strategic interventions to
improve growth and development and mitigate negative clinical
outcomes. The purpose of this review is to elucidate the
underlying complex mechanisms involved in the development of

PROTEIN ENERGY WASTING IN CHRONIC
KIDNEY DISEASE
The International Society of Renal Nutrition and Metabolism
(ISRNM) defines protein energy wasting as a “the state of
decreased body stores of protein and energy fuels (that is, body
protein and fat masses)” (17). This term was proposed by ISRNM
in 2008 to specifically refer to a state of decreased body stores
of protein and fat (wasting). This is to be distinguished from
protein energy malnutrition, a form of protein energy wasting
characterized purely by inadequate dietary intake. Moreover,
unlike protein energy malnutrition, protein energy wasting
cannot be corrected solely by increasing energy intake (17).
A comparison between protein energy wasting and protein
energy malnutrition can be found in Table 2. Protein energy
wasting is prevalent in patients with CKD, and is associated with

impaired growth and development in children, increased risk
of cardiovascular disease, infection and death (18). In children
with protein energy wasting, anthropometric measurements
fall 2 standard deviations below the normal weight for age
(underweight), height for age (stunting) and weight for height
(wasting) (19).
The pathogenesis of protein energy wasting is complex and
multifactorial. Decreased protein and energy intake due to
anorexia, increased protein catabolism, decreased anabolism,
chronic inflammation, metabolic acidosis and hormonal
imbalances have all been linked to protein energy wasting
as etiological factors (14, 17, 20, 21) (Figure 1). Anorexia is
common in patients with CKD and may result from alterations
in orexigenic (appetite stimulating) and anorexigenic (appetite
inhibiting) hormones, accumulation of metabolic waste products
in the body in kidney failure, abnormal taste and the effect
of medications on taste buds. Accumulative impact of these
factors results in decreased nutrient intake. The result of a
chronic inflammatory state in CKD is an increase in resting
energy expenditure, which promotes protein catabolism and
decreased anabolism. Studies have shown an increase in resting
energy expenditure ranging from 12 to 20% during dialysis
(22), suggesting an increased need for protein and energy
intake in dialysis patients. Protein catabolism, in addition to
increased protein losses (mostly amino acids) through dialysis
techniques (both hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis) and
decreased synthesis of albumin leads to a state of negative
nitrogen balance and muscle wasting (14, 23). In children on
peritoneal dialysis, peritoneal protein losses can be significant
and contribute to the development of protein malnutrition
and growth impairment. An inverse correlation between body
surface area and peritoneal losses of protein in children on
continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis is well recognized, with
younger children experiencing greater protein losses (24, 25).
These losses are especially high during episodes of peritonitis
(25). Although adequate protein intake is essential in children
with CKD to avoid negative nitrogen balance and help preserve
muscle mass, this in itself may not be adequate in preventing
protein energy wasting (21, 26). Control of co-morbidities and
the chronic inflammatory state is also necessary. The National
Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative
(KDOQI) recommends maintaining “dietary protein intake
(DPI) at 100–140% of the Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) for
ideal body weight in children with CKD stage 3 and at 100–120%
of the DRI in children with CKD stages 4–5. In children with
CKD stage 5D, it suggests to maintain DPI at 100% of the DRI
for ideal body weight plus an allowance for dialytic protein and
amino acid losses.” The KDOQI recommendations for protein
intake in children with CKD is presented in Table 3. Energy
requirements for children with CKD stages 2–5 and those on
dialysis are recommended to be at 100% of the estimated energy
requirements for chronological age (27).
MICRONUTRIENT DEFICIENCY IN
CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE
CKD predisposes patients to vitamin and mineral deficiencies,
which may contribute to comorbidities such as anemia,
cardiovascular disease, and metabolic imbalances. The overall
decrease in nutritional intake, dietary restrictions, poor intestinal
absorption, inflammatory state, metabolic acidosis, and dialysate
losses all put the CKD patient at risk for micronutrient
deficiencies (28). Studies in CKD patients including dialysis
and non-dialysis patients shows a decrease in the intake of
micronutrients such as vitamins, folate, iron, and pantothenic
acid (29). A recent examination of a cohort of children with CKD
showed that 28% were deficient in 25 hydroxyvitamin D (30).
Losses of zinc, selenium, folic acid, pyridoxine and ascorbic acid
during hemodialysis are well documented. Despite the limited
intake and dialysate losses of micronutrients, appropriate levels
of supplementation of these micronutrients in CKD patients
are yet to be clearly determined. For instance, multivitamin
supplementation in children on both hemodialysis and peritoneal
dialysis have been shown to result in intakes exceeding the
recommended daily allowance for these vitamins (28, 29, 31).
The 2009 KDOQI pediatric nutrition guidelines “suggested that
supplementation of vitamins and trace elements be provided to
children with CKD stages 2–5 if dietary intake alone does not
meet 100% of the DRI or if clinical evidence of a deficiency,
possibly confirmed by low blood levels of the vitamin or trace
element, is present. It is suggested that children with CKD
stage 5D receive a water-soluble vitamin supplement” (27).
However, these recommendations are based mostly on limited
and low quality evidence and expert opinion. A recent systematic
analysis has concluded that there is insufficient evidence to
support the routine supplementation of vitamins in patients on
hemodialysis and an individualized approach to supplementation
is recommended (32).
PATHOPHYSIOLOGIC MECHANISMS OF
PROTEIN ENERGY WASTING IN CHRONIC
KIDNEY DISEASE
Multiple risk factors underlie the pathogenesis of malnutrition in
patients with CKD. The following is an overview of the various
mechanisms involved.

Metabolic Dysfunction in Chronic Kidney
Disease
The metabolic milieu in CKD is significantly altered due to
the progressive accumulation of metabolic by-products that are
naturally cleared by the kidneys. Metabolic derangements such
as metabolic acidosis, hyperparathyroidism, insulin resistance,
upregulation of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system and
dyslipidemia are common in CKD (33). Metabolic acidosis
occurs early in CKD because of reduced excretion of the acid
load generated by metabolic activity. Multiple studies have shown
an association between metabolic acidosis and increased protein
catabolism in patients with CKD (34–36). Proteolysis induced
by an up regulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, also
facilitates the degradation of whole body protein. Metabolic
acidosis, chronic inflammation, insulin resistance and increased
angiotensin II levels, all of which are seen in CKD, also stimulate
the ubiquitin-proteasome system of enzymes (36, 37). As a
result, muscle wasting and malnutrition ensue. Uremic toxins,
which are progressively retained in CKD, are also known to
inhibit lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase resulting in lack
Frontiers in Pediatrics | www.frontiersin.org 4 June 2018 | Volume 6 | Article 161

Iorember Malnutrition in Chronic Kidney Disease
of degradation of lipids and dyslipidemia (38). Correction of
metabolic derangements through the provision of adequate
dialysis and use of available medical therapies is an important
treatment strategy in the management of malnutrition in CKD
(36). Although several reports have suggested an increase
in resting energy expenditure in patients with CKD, others
have suggested that non dialyzed CKD patients’ resting energy
expenditure is similar or even lower than their healthy age
matched controls (39, 40).
Hormonal Imbalance and Appetite
Regulation in Chronic Kidney Disease
The kidneys play a major role in the synthesis and regulation
of a wide variety of hormones in the body. As kidney
function declines, hormonal imbalance becomes a characteristic
feature and this has been implicated in the suppression of
appetite, muscle wasting and growth impairment in CKD.
Insulin resistance occurs early in CKD. Using the euglycemic
insulin clamp technique, DeFronzo and colleagues were able
to demonstrate reduced glucose metabolism and sensitivity
to insulin in uremic patients (41). This technique allows for
assessment of sensitivity of skeletal muscle to insulin, which
is the dominant site of insulin resistance in CKD. Insulin
resistance in these patients leads to increased protein catabolism
and muscle wasting. Additionally, insulin resistance has been
implicated in the progressive deterioration of kidney function in
CKD (14, 42, 43).
Growth impairment, defined by height standard deviation
score < −1.88 (less than the 3rd percentile), is common in
children with CKD and is associated with poor outcomes. The
growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and
insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGF-1BP) axis is
significantly altered in CKD. Growth impairment occurs as a
result of tissue resistance to the effects of GH and not deficiency
per se, since levels of these hormones are known to be normal
or elevated in CKD (14, 26, 44). Excessive water and salt loss,
especially in children with congenital renal disorders, contribute
to growth impairment in chronic kidney disease (45).
Another common feature of CKD is anorexia, which worsens
with deterioration of kidney function. Anorexia leads to
decreased nutritional intake, which predisposes to protein energy
wasting and micronutrient deficiency in patients with CKD. The
mechanism of appetite suppression in these patients is attributed
to complex dysregulation of neuroendocrine pathways involving
orexigenic (appetite stimulating) and anorexigenic (appetite
inhibiting) substances (Table 4). The role of insulin (produced
by the pancreas), leptin (produced by adipose tissue), ghrelin
(produced in the gastrointestinal tract), and pro-inflammatory
cytokines including IL-6 and TNF-alpha in CKD related anorexia
have been investigated in recent years. Insulin and leptin are
hormones whose levels are known to be elevated in CKD.
Elevated levels of insulin and leptin have been implicated in the
suppression of appetite and stimulation of energy expenditure
in patients with CKD (46, 47). Leptin belongs to the family
of IL-6 cytokines and also plays a pro-inflammatory role in
CKD (48). Interleukin-6 and TNF-alpha are also involved in
appetite suppression in CKD (46, 47, 49, 50). Ghrelin is an
appetite-stimulating hormone secreted by the stomach. Its role
in anorexia in CKD has been extensively investigated. It is
typically released in response to fasting and has potent appetite
stimulatory properties (51). Ghrelin exists in 3 different forms
including acyl ghrelin, desacyl ghrelin and obestatin, each of

which has a different effect on appetite (Table 4). While some
studies have demonstrated elevated levels of ghrelin in patients
with CKD, others have found no difference in the levels when
compared to healthy control subjects (48, 52–55). Administration
of ghrelin in CKD subjects has been shown to improve food
intake and lean body mass and could represent a therapeutic
approach to the treatment of protein energy malnutrition in these
patients (56–58). It is important to remember that medication use
in CKD can also affect taste and appetite, decreasing nutritional
intake.
Inflammation and Protein Energy Wasting
in Chronic Kidney Disease
Chronic systemic inflammation is highly prevalent in patients
with CKD and is associated with increased disease burden.
Markers of inflammation including pro-inflammatory cytokines
IL-6, IL-1β, IL-18, IL-6, TNFα, IL-8 and C - reactive protein
(CRP) levels are elevated in patients with CKD and have
been linked to increased mortality rates in these patients.
Hypoalbuminemia and elevated ferritin levels are other markers
of inflammation, with hypoalbuminemia being a strong predictor
of mortality in these patient (11, 23, 59). Increased hospitalization
rates, resistance to erythropoietin stimulating agents, endothelial
vascular injury, coronary calcification, increased resting energy
expenditure and catabolism leading to protein energy wasting
are all known consequences of chronic inflammation in CKD in
both children and adults (12, 23, 60–62). Chronic inflammatory
state induces anorexia, decreases protein and caloric intake and
reduces synthesis of albumin leading to protein energy wasting
and hypoalbuminemia (63). Recent studies have proposed the
use of the malnutrition-inflammation score (MIS) to more
accurately define the malnutrition and inflammatory burden in
patients with CKD, rather than the use of individual indices. This
score has shown a strong correlation with CRP and superiority
in predicting poor outcomes in dialysis patients (64–66). A
comprehensive and multifaceted approach to the treatment of
inflammation in patients with CKD might mitigate malnutrition
and lead to more favorable outcomes.
Altered Bowel Flora in Chronic Kidney
Disease
The intestinal microbial flora is significantly altered in patients
with CKD and this has been thought to play a pathogenic role in
the chronic inflammatory state seen in CKD. Quantitative studies
have shown a reduction in the total number and composition
of bacteria in patients with end stage kidney disease (67). These
changes lead to the generation and systemic accumulation of
pro-inflammatory uremic toxins including indoxyl sulfate, pcresyl sulfate, amines, ammonia and rimethylamine-N-oxide.
Moreover, disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier in
patients with CKD facilitates the systemic absorption of these
toxins. These uremic toxins induce inflammation, endothelial
injury, cardiovascular disease and protein energy wasting (68,
69). Therapeutic strategies aimed at normalizing intestinal
microbiota in patients with CKD might help ameliorate chronic
inflammation, malnutrition and other comorbidities.
Effect of Gastroparesis on Nutritional
Status in Chronic Kidney Disease
Delayed gastric emptying (gastroparesis) is common in
patients with CKD, as demonstrated in multiple gastric
emptying studies (70–72). The elevated levels of gastrointestinal
hormones including gastrin, cholecystokinin and gastric
inhibitory polypeptide may alter gastric motor function in CKD
patients (73). Gastroparesis is associated with gastrointestinal
symptoms such as dyspepsia, early satiety, bloating, vomiting,
and gastroesophageal reflux. These symptoms contribute to
decreased nutritional intake in no small measure and are an
important cause of malnutrition in patients with chronic kidney
disease (71). Dialysis therapy and the use of prokinetic agents
such as erythromycin or metoclopramide have been shown
to improve gastrointestinal motor function in these patients
(70, 74).
Effect of Dialysis Procedure and Dialysis
Dose on Nutrition in Chronic Kidney
Disease
While malnutrition is common in dialysis patients in general,
the dialysis technique itself might contribute to nutritional
deficits in unique ways. For instance, hemodialysis patients
have higher levels of CRP, inflammation, oxidative stress and
increased protein muscle breakdown when compared to other
CKD patients. This has been attributed to the induction of a
cascade of inflammatory pathways when blood comes in contact
with the dialyzer membrane (61, 75). As previously discussed,
losses of albumin are enhanced in peritoneal dialysis, putting
these patients at greater risk for protein energy malnutrition
(7, 24). Conversely, less than optimal or under-dialysis might
lead to decreased clearance of uremic toxins, predisposing
patients to the development of malnutrition. Multiple studies
have investigated the impact of dialysis dose on the nutritional
status of dialysis patients and found an improvement in the
nutritional status of those patients receiving more dialysis (76–
80). At a minimum, patients receiving dialysis should be provided
the KDOQI recommended dialysis dose for both hemodialysis
and peritoneal dialysis to avoid under-dialysis.
THERAPEUTIC CONSIDERATIONS
Treatment of malnutrition in patients with CKD requires a
multidisciplinary, multifaceted and individualized approach. The
renal dietitian is central to the assessment and monitoring
of the nutritional status of the child with CKD. Other team
members include the nephrologist, nurses, social workers,
caregivers and therapists. The KDOQI recommended clinical
parameters for the assessment of nutritional status in children
with chronic kidney disease are depicted in Table 1. These
recommendations emphasize the need to integrate these
parameters as no single marker can give an accurate assessment
of nutritional status. Once a comprehensive assessment has
been made, an individualized dietary prescription should ensure
adequate intake of calories, micronutrients and protein to
promote growth and development of the child (Table 2).
Frontiers in Pediatrics | www.frontiersin.org 6 June 2018 | Volume 6 | Article 161

Iorember Malnutrition in Chronic Kidney Disease
Supplemental feeding through nasogastric and gastric tubes
might be necessary to provide adequate intake. Treatment of
comorbidities such as metabolic acidosis, gastroesophageal reflux
disease, and constipation are necessary for effective management
of malnutrition. The provision of adequate dialysis cannot
be overemphasized in patients on chronic dialysis therapy.
Finally, careful and continuous monitoring of nutritional status
is essential for sustaining growth and development and the
recommended intervals can be found in the KDOQI clinical
practice guidelines (27).
SUMMARY AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Chronic kidney disease creates a complex pathologic
environment characterized by metabolic alterations that
affect nutrient intake, metabolism and energy expenditure,
predisposing patients to the development of malnutrition and
an increased risk for morbidity and mortality. Inflammation,
metabolic acidosis, uremic toxins and hormonal dysregulation
all play significant roles in the pathogenesis of protein
energy wasting and growth failure in children with CKD.
Supplementation of protein and calories alone may not
adequately control malnutrition. A multifaceted approach
including the treatment of comorbidities is necessary.
Therapeutic interventions that specifically target inflammation
and other metabolic derangements are essential for the
successful treatment of malnutrition in these patients. A
better understanding of the mechanisms involved in hormonal
regulation of appetite in patients with CKD might lead to the
development of novel and effective therapies for malnutrition.
