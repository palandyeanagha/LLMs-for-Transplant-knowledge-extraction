1 Summary
2 In this Grand Round presentation, the case of a woman with acute decompensation of 
3 cirrhosis due to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is described. She subsequently 
4 developed liver failure, type 1 hepatorenal syndrome, severe hepatic encephalopathy,
5 and respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Her critical illness raised several 
6 clinical and ethical dilemmas regarding prognosis, therapeutic options, and futility of 
7 care. We will discuss the utility of Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF) entity 
8 detection, the tools available for estimating outcomes, the current evidence on 
9 management of ACLF, and potential salvage therapies (including experimental).

1 Clinical Vignette
2 A 34-year-old woman with a history of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related cirrhosis 
3 was admitted to the hospital through the emergency department for an acute 
4 decompensation characterized by jaundice and ascites. A diagnosis of community5 acquired spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) complicated by bacteremia with 
6 Escherichia coli was made. Despite prompt adequate antibiotic treatment (ceftriaxone
7 for 7 days) and albumin infusion, physicians observed a severe clinical deterioration with 
8 the development of neurological and respiratory failure. The patient was referred to the 
9 intensive care unit (ICU) of University Hospital. At admission, the patient was 
10 mechanically ventilated with severe parameters (low tidal volume, positive end 
11 expiratory pressure [PEEP] of 15 cm H2O and fractional inspired oxygen [FiO2] 50%,
12 resulting in arterial oxygen partial pressure [PaO2] of 61 mm Hg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 122), 
13 stage IV hepatic encephalopathy (EH), type I hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) responding
14 to terlipressin 4 mg per day (creatinine 1.1 mg/dL), INR 3.58, and total bilirubin 22 
15 mg/dL. Thoracic computed tomography showed slight bilateral pleural effusion and left 
16 basal condensation. A systematic microbiological screening including bronchoalveolar 
17 lavage, blood, urinary and ascitic cultures did not demonstrate any overt infection. After 
18 3 days of intensive management, the clinical situation did not improve significantly 
19 (mechanical ventilation with PEEP 12 cmH2O, FiO2 50%, PaO2 65 mmHg and ratio 
20 PaO2: FiO2 of 130, stage IV EH, serum ammonia level of 376 µg/dL, INR 2.98, total 
21 bilirubin 30 mg/dL, creatinine 0.9 mg/dL under terlipressin 4 mg per day). At this time, 
22 orthotopic liver transplantation (LT) was considered to be the only long-term life-saving 
23 option for this patient by the liver transplant staff. However, this candidate seemed to be 
24 too sick to receive an organ.

1 There are many clinical questions that are prompted by this case, including:
2 1) Is the definition of Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF) useful in clinical 
3 practice?
4 2) Which precipitating events and pathogenic mechanisms are responsible for 
5 ACLF?
6 3) Do we have tools to predict outcomes and clinical courses for ACLF?
7 4) What are the current management strategies, supported by evidence, for patients 
8 with ACLF?
9 5) Is salvage LT a reasonable therapeutic option for ACLF? What is the ideal timing 
10 for LT?
11 6) Are there therapeutic (including experimental) strategies to improve survival or to 
12 bridge the patient to LT?
13
14 1 – Is the definition of ACLF useful in clinical practice? What is the burden of 
15 ACLF in acute decompensation of cirrhosis?
16
17 Intuitively, it has long been thought by hepatologists that a syndrome characterized by 
18 the presence of multiorgan failures is the final common pathway driving death in acutely 
19 decompensated patients with cirrhosis. Hepatologists used to call this syndrome “ACLF”, 
20 but its components were poorly defined [1]. In 2013, a definition of ACLF was published 
21 based on the results of a large, multicenter prospective, observational study (CANONIC 
22 study) performed under the umbrella of the EASL-CLIF Consortium in 1343 patients with 
23 cirrhosis who were hospitalized for an acute decompensation (AD) of their liver disease
24 [2]. This study provided the first evidence-based diagnostic criteria that permitted 

6
1 practitioners to distinguish between ACLF and ‘mere’ AD (i.e., traditional AD) (Table 1). 
2 Among patients hospitalized for AD, 70% had traditional AD characterized by the 
3 absence of major organ dysfunction/failure, low-grade systemic inflammation, and good 
4 prognosis [2,3]. The remaining 30% had ACLF, characterized by organ 
5 dysfunction/failure, high-grade systemic inflammation, and poor prognosis. The Kaplan6 Meier plots of the probability of survival revealed significantly poorer outcomes among 
7 patients with ACLF compared to those with traditional AD (Figure 1). Of note, the 
8 separation of the two curves occurred very early, indicating that great effort should be 
9 made to improve patient care during the first days of hospitalization. Together, these 
10 findings indicate the utility of ACLF definition for appropriate management of patients 
11 with AD.
12
13 2 - Which precipitating events and pathogenic mechanisms are responsible for 
14 ACLF?
15
16 The nature of the precipitating events leading to ACLF differs according to country [4]. In 
17 Western countries the most commonly identified precipitating factors are bacterial 
18 infection, recent excessive alcohol use, and gastrointestinal hemorrhage (Table 2) [2]. In 
19 Asia, these precipitating factors also exist but are less common than flares in patients 
20 with hepatitis B virus-related chronic liver disease. The Asian prevalence of other 
21 precipitating events such as acute hepatitis (caused by hepatitis A or hepatitis E viruses) 
22 superimposed on cirrhosis has not yet been clearly established. Of note, the European 
23 experience has shown that 13.5% of patients with established ACLF had two 
24 precipitating factors or more (Table 2) [2]. Interestingly, in ~44% of patients in the 

7
1 CANONIC study, the development of ACLF was not preceded by an identifiable 
2 precipitating factor [2].
3 The pathophysiology of ACLF is still unclear. However, there is some information 
4 available on the landscape of systemic inflammation in AD. Compared to healthy 
5 subjects, patients with traditional AD exhibit features of systemic circulatory dysfunction 
6 (SCD) (i.e., high plasma levels of renin and copeptin), and systemic inflammation (i.e., 
7 high plasma levels of cytokines and chemokines) [3]. Compared to patients with 
8 traditional AD, those with ACLF have much more marked SCD and systemic 
9 inflammation [3]. Of note, patients with AD have full-blown inflammation, involving pro10 and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Since systemic inflammation can cause SCD, it has 
11 been suggested that inflammation-induced SCD, via tissue hypoperfusion, drives the
12 development of end-organ failure in cirrhosis [5]. However, it has been recently shown 
13 that the strength of association of ACLF with excessive systemic inflammation is 
14 significantly higher than with SCD [3]. These findings suggest that the association 
15 between systemic inflammation and ACLF is independent, at least in part, of SCD, 
16 raising the question of whether immune cells orchestrated by cytokines and chemokines
17 play a major role in the development of organ failures. 
18 Environmental (e.g., bacterial infection, ‘binge’ alcohol drinking) and non-environmental 
19 (e.g., gastrointestinal hemorrhage) precipitating factors are expected triggers of systemic 
20 inflammation in ACLF. It is important to note that similar precipitating factors have been 
21 found for traditional AD (Table 2). The question now has become, for a given 
22 precipitating factor, which mechanisms explain why some patients will develop 
23 excessive inflammation and ACLF while others will develop less intense inflammation 
24 associated with traditional AD? There is no clear answer to this question. For example, 

8
1 in the context of bacterial infection, differences in severity may be related to differences 
2 in environmental factors (characteristics of infecting bacteria), host non-genetic factors 
3 (age), and host genetic factors that increase predisposition to the development of severe 
4 sepsis [6]. Future research is needed to elucidate mechanisms of excessive 
5 inflammation in response to identified precipitating events.
6 Table 2 shows that precipitating events are not detected in a substantial proportion of 
7 patients with traditional AD (with low grade inflammation) and ACLF (with high grade 
8 inflammation). One cannot exclude the existence of a bacterial infection that routine 
9 diagnostic methods failed to detect. Alternatively, patients with cirrhosis but without overt 
10 infection may have increased intestinal permeability allowing bacterial by-products (e.g., 
11 lipopolysaccharide) to translocate into the systemic circulation [4]. In this scenario, 
12 bacterial products would induce inflammation through their recognition by the innate 
13 immune system. If this hypothesis is true, it would raise important questions regarding 
14 how differences in the intensity of systemic inflammation between patients with 
15 traditional AD and those with ACLF can be explained. 
16
17 3 - Do we have tools to predict outcomes in patients with acute decompensation 
18 (AD) and a clinical course of ACLF?
19
20 The outcomes of cirrhotic patients with AD and ACLF and those with traditional AD differ 
21 dramatically in short- and intermediate-term analyses. In the CANONIC study, patients 
22 with ACLF had 28-day and 3-month mortality of 33% and 51% compared to 5% and 
23 13%, respectively, in traditional AD (see Figure 1) [2]. This last figure shows that some 
24 patients with traditional AD have a substantial risk of short-term mortality. A prognostic 

9
1 score (CLIF-Consortium score for AD patients, CLIF-C ADs) was developed especially 
2 for this group of patients based on the variables associated medium-term mortality (age, 
3 serum sodium, log-transformed white cell count, serum creatinine, and INR) [7]. A CLIF4 ADs equal to or lower than 45 predicted a very low 90-day mortality rate (2%) and a 
5 score of 60 or higher was associated with 90-day mortality of 31%. This score was 
6 externally validated and seems to be useful for discriminating AD patients who can be 
7 discharged early from those who require specific attention to prevent complications and 
8 development of ACLF.
9 When a patient with AD fulfils ACLF diagnostic criteria, we have several tools for 
10 estimating outcomes: the baseline grade of ACLF, the clinical course of the syndrome,
11 and a specific score (CLIF-Consortium ACLF score, CLIF-C ACLFs). The initial grade of 
12 ACLF is defined according the number of organ failures (OFs) and the presence of 
13 kidney and/or neurological dysfunction (see Table 1) [2]. The 28-day and 90-day 
14 mortality rates are 22% and 41% for ACLF grade 1 (ACLF-1), 32% and 52% for ACLF-2,
15 and 77% and 79% for ACLF-3, respectively. Moreover, we have shown that ACLF is an 
16 extraordinarily dynamic syndrome, evolving toward resolution or improvement in 49% of 
17 patients, showing a steady or fluctuating course in 30%, and worsening in 20% [8]. The 
18 short-term mortality of ACLF patients is accurately predicted by the clinical course of the 
19 syndrome, defined by the evolution between the initial and final ACLF grades, rather 
20 than, and independently from, the initial grade. Also, the study reported that for a large 
number of ACLF patients (81%), the final ACLF grade settled between the 3rd and 7th 21
22 day after diagnosis (d3-7 ACLF), leading to the conclusion that the d3-7 ACLF grade 
23 more accurately predicts short- and mid-term prognosis than the initial grade. Finally, a 
24 specific prognostic score for ACLF patients has been designed. The CLIF-OFs has been 

10
1 derived to simplify the original CLIF-SOFAs, assigning a sub-score based on a 3-point 
2 range to each organ system, resulting in a final CLIF-OFs ranging from 6 to 18 (Table 1) 
3 [9]. Interestingly, the prognostic significance of the cut-off levels for diagnosing OF in the 
4 original CLIF-SOFAs was confirmed in the simpler CLIF-C OFs. To improve prognostic 
5 accuracy, a third score, the CLIF-C ACLFs, was created, incorporating the CLIF-C OFs 
6 and two other independent prognostic indicators of mortality, age, and white blood cell 
7 count [9]. Compared to the MELDs, MELD-Nas, and Child-Pugh score, the CLIF-C 
8 ACLFs consistently improved prediction error rates by 19% to 28% for 28-day and 90-
9 day outcomes of ACLF patients. These results were confirmed on an independent 
10 cohort of ICU-hospitalized patients with cirrhosis.
11 Due to the high mortality rate associated with ACLF and the need for expensive 
12 resources, physicians frequently discuss the utility of prolonging life-sustaining 
13 treatment. In our experience, the 90-day mortality rate reached 100% only in patients 
14 with initial ACLF-3 and ≥ 4 OF or a CLIF-C ACLFs > 64 at 3 to 7 days after ACLF 
15 diagnosis [8]. Another study reported that patients with a bilirubin level > 22 mg/dL, HE 
16 grade 3 or 4, INR > 2.5 with either creatinine level > 1 mg/dL, or lactate > 1.5 mmol/L at 
17 baseline, and persistent derangement at day 4 or 7, had a mortality rate of 100% at 28 
18 days [10]. Thus, if therapeutic options, such as liver transplantation, are contraindicated 
19 or not available for patients fulfilling these criteria, intensive organ support should be 
20 considered to be futile. These results, obtained from relatively small series of patients, 
21 must be validated in large independent cohorts and must be challenged by new 
22 therapeutic (including experimental) strategies.
23 These scores can be calculated at the European Foundation for the study of Chronic 
24 Liver Failure (EF-CLIF) website (http://www.efclif.com).

2 4 - What are the current management strategies, supported by evidence, for 
3 patients with ACLF?
4
5 Aside from treating the underlying precipitating factor (nucleot(s)ide analogs for HBV
6 flare, corticosteroids for severe AH, antibiotics for bacterial infections, etc. see Table 3),
7 management of ACLF is poorly defined and is currently mainly supportive. Organ
8 support and intensive monitoring are the cornerstones of management of ACLF patients.
9 Currently, there is no evidence to support alternative strategies for the management of
10 organ failures in patients with cirrhosis compared to other critically ill patients (goals of
11 resuscitation, fluid therapy, norepinephrine infusion, lung protective ventilation using low
12 tidal volume) [11]. When acute kidney injury related to hepatorenal syndrome is
13 suspected, vasoconstrictors (terlipressin, octreotide/midodrine, if terlipressin is
14 unavailable, or norepinephrine) associated with intravenous albumin are recommended
15 [12]. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is frequently preferred to
16 intermittent hemodialysis in critically ill cirrhotic patients due to greater cardiovascular
17 stability [13]. Relative adrenal insufficiency (RAI), demonstrated by short synacthen test,
18 is frequent in decompensated cirrhosis (~30%) and in cirrhosis with septic shock (~70%)
19 [14,15]. In a non-randomized controlled trial with cirrhotic patients in septic shock,
20 intravenous infusion of hydrocortisone (50 mg every 6 hours) in the case of RAI
21 improved survival compared to historical data from the same unit [15].

1 5 – Is salvage LT a reasonable therapeutic option for ACLF? What is the ideal 
2 timing for LT?
3
4 The absence of improvement or resolution of organ/system failures despite maximal 
5 supportive management is associated with dramatic outcomes and leads practitioners to 
6 consider potential salvage liver transplantation (LT) [8,16]. This therapeutic option 
7 remains controversial. Indeed, transplantation in sicker recipients, in particular cirrhotic 
8 patients requiring multi-organ support, is unquestionably associated with an improved 
9 survival benefit but could result in less acceptable longer term survival rates after LT. In 
10 the context of scarcity of liver donors, the potential benefit of LT in ACLF patients must 
11 always be balanced against the need for rationing limited resources [17]. Experiences
12 with LT in ACLF patients from European centers are increasingly being published. In the 
13 CANONIC study, LT of ACLF patients (38% had ACLF grade 3 [ACLF-3]) was 
14 associated with an acceptable 1-year post-LT survival of 75% [8]. Similarly, excellent 1-
15 and 5-year survival rates of 87% and 82%, respectively, were reported in a study from 
16 Austria of LT in 32 out of 144 ACLF patients [18]. A recent retrospective study from three 
17 French liver centers reported that 73 patients with ACLF-3 received LT with an 
18 outstanding 1-year post-LT survival of 84%, suggesting that ACLF-3 per se should not 
19 be viewed as a contraindication for LT [19]. Moreover, the classical scores used to 
20 predict post-LT outcomes, such as pre-allocation survival outcomes following liver 
21 transplantation (P-SOFT), balance of risk (BAR), and UCLA futility risk score, were 
22 inaccurate predictors of post-LT mortality of transplanted ACLF-3 patients. 
23 In contrast, other studies have demonstrated unacceptable survival rates after LT. A 
24 small single center study reported that 13 ACLF-3 patients (all supported by mechanical 

13
1 ventilation and vasopressors, and 77% by renal replacement therapy) were transplanted 
2 with a 1-year post-LT survival rate of 46% [20]. Another recent small French 
3 retrospective study seemed to confirm these poor results for ACLF-3 (1-year post-LT 
4 survival rate of 43%) [21]. Post-LT complications of ACLF patients (observed in the 
5 majority of cases) were associated with longer intensive care unit and hospital stays 
6 after LT compared to patients without ACLF [19]. Due to high short-term mortality
7 associated with ACLF, organ shortages, and the reluctance of physicians to put ACLF 
8 patients on the waiting list, the likelihood of having to access to LT is low for ACLF 
9 patients. In the CANONIC experience, a minority (6%) of ACLF patients were 
10 transplanted. A mortality rate of more than 50% for ACLF patients was reported on the 
11 transplant waiting list, compared to about 15% of patients listed for other indications [18].
12 Another challenge for LT in the setting of ACLF is definition of the ideal timing for this 
13 option. Indeed, optimization of clinical condition by resolution or improvement of 
14 organ/system failures before LT is associated with a significantly better post-LT 
15 outcome. In the CANONIC experience, liver transplanted patients with resolution of 
16 ACLF had a 1-year post-LT survival of 90% compared to 75% for those with a remaining 
17 ACLF at the time of LT [8]. Moreover, the impressive post-LT results for ACLF-3 patients 
18 in the French study could also be due to the clinical improvement observed between ICU 
19 admission and LT [19]. On the other hand, in the case of clinical deterioration, a prompt 
20 decision for LT must be made but limits defining when the patient should be considered 
21 to be too sick to be transplanted and LT as futile are currently largely unknown. The 
22 concept of a timing window is suggested for LT in ACLF (see Figure 2).
23

14
1 6 – Are there therapeutic (including experimental) strategies for improving
2 survival or bridging the patient to LT?
3
4 Blood purification or detoxification systems
5
6 Liver failure is associated with a rise in various endogenous substances (such as
7 bilirubin, ammonia, protein breakdown products, lactate, glutamine, free fatty acids,
8 endogenous benzodiazepines, and pro-inflammatory cytokines) perpetuating the loss of
9 liver function and extrahepatic organ dysfunction. This provides a rationale for the use of
10 detoxification devices which attempt to remove these toxic substances. CRRT is capable
11 of removing toxic substances from the circulation but its efficacy is low because most
12 toxic substances are protein bound or have high molecular weights. In some studies,
13 patients with acute or chronic liver dysfunction on CRRT showed a significant reduction
14 in serum ammonia levels [22,23]. Albumin dialysis (molecular adsorbent recirculating
system, MARS®; fractionated plasma separation and adsorption system, Prometheus®15 )
16 failed to clearly demonstrate a survival benefit for ACLF patients but the efficacy of these
17 devices was assessed in a group of patients with ACLF that was not precisely defined
18 [24,25]. Plasma exchange (PE) has been widely used in Eastern countries in HBV19 related ACLF. Some non-randomized trials suggest a survival benefit in HBV-related
20 ACLF patients treated with PE compared to standard of care [26,27]. Only one RCT in
21 acute liver failure showed that high-volume PE improved transplant-free survival
22 compared to standard medical treatment providing a proof of concept [28].
23 Unfortunately, PE has not been assessed in patients with ACLF from other etiologies.
24

15
1 Immunomodulatory treatments
2
3 Subcutaneous administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (5 µg/kg),
4 which aims to mobilize bone marrow stem cells and promote hepatic progenitor cell
5 proliferation, has shown potential promising results in terms of short-term survival
6 benefits in two RCTs [29,30]. G-CSF improved liver function and SOFA scores and
7 prevented the occurrence of HRS, HE, and sepsis. The use of G-CSF remains
8 experimental and these results need to be confirmed in large randomized controlled
9 trials.
10
11 Cell therapy
12
13 Cell therapy is beginning to be assessed in ACLF in Asia but in small trials and with
14 different diagnostic criteria of ACLF. Cell therapy could repair damaged hepatocytes,
15 promote liver regeneration, and regulate immune responses. One open-label controlled
16 trial in HBV-related ACLF showed improved MELD scores and 90-day survival rates
17 after umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cell infusion [31]. Peripheral infusions of
18 allogenic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells significantly increased 6-
19 month survival rates in an RCT with patients with HBV-related ACLF [32]. Moreover, in a
20 small trial, the combination of umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells infusions
21 and PE improved outcomes of HBV-related ACLF compared to PE alone [33].
22
23 Back to the clinical case
24

16
1 The patient was admitted to the hospital with AD without ACLF (according EASL-CLIF 
2 criteria) triggered by SBP. At this time, her CLIF-C ADs was 55 with an estimated 
3 probability of dying of 5% at 1 month and 14% at 3 months, putting the patient in the 
4 grey zone of CLIF-C ADs (between 45 and 60) with an uncertain outcome. 
5 Unfortunately, she very quickly developed an ACLF-3 with 4 OFs (liver, coagulation, 
6 lung, and brain) requiring ICU admission and a CLIF-C ACLFs of 55 with an estimated 
7 probability of dying at 1 month of 37%. After three days of critical management, she 
8 remained in poor clinical condition without improvement (ACLF-3 and 4 OFs). According 
9 the CANONIC experience, this clinical course was associated with a mortality rate
10 without LT of 90% at 1 month and 100% at three months [8]. The option of salvage LT 
11 was considered. The most valid data about LT in ACLF-3 with 1-year post-LT survival of 
12 84% coming from three French centers suggested some limit criteria for this option: 
13 active gastrointestinal bleeding, control of sepsis for less than 24 h, hemodynamic 
14 instability requiring dose of norepinephrine > 50 µg/min, lung failure defined as a 
15 PaO2/FiO2 ratio < 150 [19]. Our patient was beyond these criteria for the lung. Then, to 
16 try to bridge the patient to LT, CRRT was started and three plasma exchange sessions 
17 were performed in parallel on 6 days. Neurological improvement (stade II EH and 
18 reduction of 69% for serum ammonia levels), in parallel with resolution of respiratory 
19 failure (PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 304) resulting in extubation, was observed. The patient was 
20 transferred to the ward and placed on the waiting list for LT with a model of end-stage 
21 liver disease (MELD) score of 27 and was transplanted two weeks later. Currently, she 
22 is still alive 6 months after LT.

1 Conclusions
2
3 There are challenges in the management of AD of cirrhosis, particularly in the distinction 
4 between those with and those without ACLF (ACLF vs. traditional AD). Indeed, these 
5 two frequent clinical situations are associated with different outcomes and therapeutic 
6 strategies. Beside identifying and treating the precipitating event, the goal is to stratify
7 patients with AD without ACLF according the risk of developing ACLF and dying. On the 
8 other hand, the principal challenges of the management of ACLF patients are to support 
9 failing organs and to estimate outcome according to clinical course. Therapeutic 
10 strategies in ACLF are mainly experimental and the objective place of salvage LT is 
11 unspecified. In summary, based on the prospective data, we have proposed an 
12 algorithm for the assessment and management of patients with AD (Figure 3).

(LT) in ACLF. The appropriate timing for LT corresponds either ideally to clinical 
improvement or deterioration that does not reach the futility limits in the pre-LT period.

The shaded area describes criteria used to define organ failures.
Grade of ACLF
 ACLF grade 1 (ACLF-1):
- Patients with single kidney failure
- Patients with non-renal organ failure plus renal dysfunction (creatinine 1.5 – 1.9 mg/dL) 
and/or brain dysfunction (grade 1 – 2 HE).
 ACLF-2: patients with two organ failures

20
 ACLF-3: patients with three or more organ failures
CLIF, chronic liver failure; RRT, renal replacement therapy; HE, hepatic encephalopathy; 
INR, international normalized ratio; MAP, mean arterial pressure; FiO2, fraction of 
inspired oxygen; PaO2, partial pressure of arterial oxygen; SpO2, pulse oximetric 
saturation.
