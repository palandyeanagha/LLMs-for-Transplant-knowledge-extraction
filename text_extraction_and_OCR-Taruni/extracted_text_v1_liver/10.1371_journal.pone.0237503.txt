Abstract
Background
Intraoperative restrictive fluid management strategies might improve postoperative outcomes in liver transplantation. Effects of vasopressors within any hemodynamic management strategy are unclear.
Methods
We conducted an observational cohort study on adult liver transplant recipients between
July 2008 and December 2017. We measured the effect of vasopressors infused at admission in the intensive care unit (ICU) and total intraoperative fluid balance. Our primary outcome was 48-hour acute kidney injury (AKI) and our secondary outcomes were 7-day AKI,
need for postoperative renal replacement therapy (RRT), time to extubation in the ICU, time
to ICU discharge and survival up to 1 year. We fitted models adjusted for confounders using
generalized estimating equations or survival models using robust standard errors. We
reported results with 95% confidence intervals.
Results
We included 532 patients. Vasopressors use was not associated with 48-hour or 7-day AKI
but modified the effects of fluid balance on RRT and mortality. A higher fluid balance was
associated with a higher need for RRT (OR = 1.52 [1.15, 2.01], p<0.001 for interaction) and
lower survival (HR = 1.71 [1.26, 2.34], p<0.01 for interaction) only among patients without
vasopressors. In patients with vasopressors, higher doses of vasopressors were associated
with a higher mortality (HR = 1.29 [1.13, 1.49] per 10 μg/min of norepinephrine).

Conclusion
The presence of any vasopressor at the end of surgery was not associated with AKI or RRT.
The use of vasopressors might modify the harmful association between fluid balance and
other postoperative outcomes. The liberal use of vasopressors to implement a restrictive
fluid management strategy deserves further investigation.
Introduction
Liver transplantation is the second most performed solid organ transplantation in the world
and is the only available treatment of end-stage liver disease and liver cancer [1, 2]. In the past
decade, while liver transplantation postoperative survival have increased, postoperative complications increased as well [3–6]. Since human organs available for transplantation are rare,
improving recipients’ postoperative outcomes is an important objective.
Several perioperative events and factors are associated with complications after liver transplantation [5, 7, 8]. Among them, hypotension and vasopressor administration have both been
associated with several harmful effects such as an increased incidence of acute kidney injury
(AKI), graft failure and mortality [7–12]. We previously suggested that restrictive fluid management strategies might be associated with less postoperative complications in liver transplantation [13].
In an observational cohort study we recently published, we suggested that a higher fluid balance was associated with longer stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and a lower survival in
liver transplantation [14]. We did not include vasopressors as one of our exposures. However,
any restrictive fluid management strategy is associated with an increased use of vasopressors
[15, 16]. Since restricting fluid administration might be beneficial in liver transplant recipients
[13, 17], but vasopressor administration seems to be associated with more complications in
some observational studies [5, 7, 8], the specific role of vasopressor use alongside any fluid
management strategy is not well-defined.
Two recent systematic reviews in patients undergoing a major surgery suggested that cardiac output-guided fluid management compared to any fixed fluid administration strategy
reduce postoperative complications by 20–30% [18, 19]. In a third meta-analysis on intraoperative cardiac output-guided management clinical trials in major surgery, the greatest reduction of postoperative AKI came from a more liberal use of vasopressors and inotropes and not
from any difference in fluid balance [20]. Patients undergoing liver transplantation were
excluded from all these studies.
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the association between intraoperative
hemodynamic management and postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) in adult liver transplant recipients. Our secondary objectives were to explore the same associations on other
patients’ postoperative outcomes.

address our new study objective. We extracted data between July 2017 and December 2019.
We included all adult liver transplant recipients who had their surgery between July 2008 and
December 2017. We excluded both patients who underwent two solid organ transplantations
simultaneously (liver + kidney or liver + lung) and patients who were on renal replacement
therapy (RRT) before their transplantation.
Organ donation, allocation and procurement was managed by our national organ procurement organization (Transplant Que´bec (www.transplantquebec.ca/en)). None of the transplant donors was from a vulnerable population and all donors or next of kin provided written
informed consent that was freely given. Donation after circulatory death is only conducted
after palliative care in our province. Donors were either previously registered in one of the
national organ donor registries (Régie de l’assurance maladie du Québec or the Chambre des
notaires du Québec organ donor registry (https://www.transplantquebec.ca/node/107)) and/or
were consented by a recognized surrogate decision maker (see S1 Appendix, for donor consent
form). Since the Province of Quebec has a universal public healthcare system, no financial
reimbursement was provided to donors families.
Exposures
Our hemodynamic management exposure was defined as the combination of vasopressors
infused at ICU admission and the total intraoperative fluid balance. We used the presence of
vasopressors at ICU admission for three reasons: all patients received vasopressors at some
point during a liver transplantation, vasopressors at this time point might better reflect the
whole fluid management strategy than vasopressor doses at any other time point (a liberal
approach would be associated with less vasopressors at the end of surgery) and data at this
time point was very well collected in our center (most of the time, intraoperative doses of vasopressors are not reported in patient charts). Fluid balance was defined as the total volume of
fluid and all blood products received (including cellsaver output transfused) to which we subtracted the diuresis, the volume of drained ascites and the total volume of bleeding measured
in the surgical suction canisters [14]. At our institution, the anesthesiology procedure included
a phlebotomy before the surgery in patients with a hemoglobin concentration above 85 g/L
and a normal renal function; this blood was transfused back to the patient in the reperfusion
phase (see S2 Appendix) [21, 22]. We considered the performance of such a phlebotomy as an
important component of the fluid management strategy: we included it in all analyses and
used it to build a propensity score in some analyses.
Use of vasopressors was thus an exposure of interest and a potential effect modifier of the
fluid balance effect on our postoperative outcomes (see S1 Fig in S2 Appendix). Because vasopressors at the end of surgery and fluid balance might also be markers of the severity of hemodynamic instability and of reperfusion syndrome, we first evaluated the aforementioned effect
modification and then analyzed vasopressors as potential confounders if no effect modification
was observed [15, 23–25]. We also converted all vasopressors to norepinephrine equivalent (in
ug per minute) and combined together to create a single total vasopressor dose variable (that we
used in subgroup and sensitivity analyses) that we used in some stratified analyses: vasopressin
was converted from units per hour to ug per minute in a 1:500 ratio (0.02 units per minute of
vasopressin = 10 ug per minute of norepinephrine) and phenylephrine was converted in a 13:1
ratio (100 ug per minute of phenylephrine = 8 ug per minute of norepinephrine) [26, 27].
Outcomes
Our primary outcome was the grade of acute kidney injury (AKI) 48 postoperative hours after
surgery [28]. Our secondary outcomes were the grade of AKI at 7 days and need for

postoperative RRT at any time after surgery. We also included time to first extubation, time to
ICU discharge and survival up to 1 year as other secondary outcomes.
Covariables
We collected patients’ demographic characteristics, liver disease diagnosis and comorbidities
as baseline characteristics. We included many perioperative variables we considered potential
confounders that might influence both hemodynamic management interventions performed
by anesthesiologists and our outcomes outside of the causal pathway. We included: age, sex,
diabetes, severity of liver failure (Model for End Stage Liver Disease Sodium (MELD)), acute
liver failure as a transplantation indication, retransplantation status, preoperative hemoglobin
concentration, preoperative creatinine concentration, baseline intraoperative central venous
pressure (CVP), the use of an intraoperative phlebotomy, length and type of vena cava clamping, length of graft cold ischemia time (CIT) and intraoperative exposure to starch (see S2
Appendix).
Data sources and measurement
We prospectively collected age, sex, intraoperative volume of fluid received, intraoperative
bleeding, diuresis, type of fluid used (crystalloids, synthetic colloids, non-synthetic colloids,
red blood cells and other blood products), the use of a phlebotomy, preoperative creatinine
and hemoglobin levels using a standardized case report form into a transplantation registry
[21, 29–31]. We completed the registry with retrospective chart review for preoperative severity of liver failure (MELD), ascites, clamping type and length, cold ischemia time and all our
outcomes, as reported in our previous publication [14]. For this study, we retrospectively collected vasopressor infusion doses at ICU admission from charts of included patients in the registry. Extracted data was kept in a coded dataset in an institutional secured server.
Sample size
We used the available sample of patients gathered for our previous publication to observe an
odds ratio of 1.05 or less in favor of a more restrictive fluid balance with an estimated incidence proportion of 48-hour AKI of 30% (with a power of 80%, a two-sided alpha level of 5%
and the inclusion of 11 covariates) [14]. The available cohort was of 532 consecutive patients
and all patients were included in our analyses.
Data analyses
We reported categorical variables as proportions and continuous variables as means with standard deviations or medians with interquartile range based on skewness. We compared fluid
balance between groups with and without vasopressors by a bivariate linear regression model.
Our outcome variables were analyzed as either ordinal (AKI), dichotomic (RRT) or as timeto-event (extubation in the ICU, ICU stay and survival). For our primary analysis, we fitted a
multivariable proportional odds regression model with the category of AKI (0, 1, 2, 3) as the
dependent variable. A similar model was fitted for our secondary AKI outcome (7-day AKI).
We fitted a logistic regression model for our RRT outcome. We used Fine and Gray models
for time to first extubation and time to ICU discharge outcomes because they are competing
risks with death and a Cox model was used for 1-year survival. We fitted all models by including vasopressor use (yes or no), fluid balance and considered their interaction by including the
product term between the two as independent variables, as well as the aforementioned confounders. When statistical interaction (effect modification) was statistically significant, we
PLOS ONE

fitted stratified models presenting the fluid balance effect by vasopressors subgroups while
adjusting the resulting models for the vasopressor dose as a continuous variable. As sensitivity
analyses, we fitted all models without significant statistical interaction with the vasopressor
dose as a continuous variable in equivalent of 10 μg/min of norepinephrine and fitted all models on complete cases only. We also explored confounding between vasopressor and fluid balance by a change-in-estimate approach.
Because some patients had repeated transplantations and were included more than once in
the cohort, our analyses were fitted by Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) (AKI and
RRT) using robust standard errors with an exchangeable correlation matrix or by time-toevent models (time to extubation, time to ICU discharge and survival) using Sandwich robust
standard errors to consider within-patient correlation. We evaluated the odds proportionality
assumption for vasopressors in our ordinal models by a likelihood ratio test and the proportionality of risks assumption in our time-to-event models by the Harrell and Lee test and a
visual inspection of the Schoenfeld residuals. Because this assumption was not always met, we
used confounder stratification, coefficient-time interaction or a phlebotomy propensity score
(that removed some variables from the model) to fit valid models. We used a phlebotomy propensity score since this variable was considered as a component of the intraoperative fluid
management strategy. We explored non-linear effects of both fluid balance and vasopressors
for all models. Multicollinearity was evaluated with the variance inflation factor. To handle
missing values, we fitted all our models on 5 datasets with imputations by chained equations
and pooled our estimates and standard errors using the Rubin’s rule. To compare baseline
characteristics between patients with and without vasopressors, we also conducted exploratory
student T tests, Mann-Whitney U tests or chi-square tests and reported them in our supplementary material. Our alpha level was set at 0.05 and we reported all results with 95% confidence intervals. We used R (R Core Team, version 3.6.1) for all statistical analyses.
Results
A total of 532 liver transplantations were available in our registry after exclusions. 527 transplantations were alive at ICU admission and 524 transplantations performed in 486 patients
had data on vasopressors (S2 Fig in S3 Appendix). We summarized patients’ characteristics in
S1 and S2 Tables in S3 Appendix for supplementary figures and tables. Two hundred and
forty-one transplantations (46%) had at least one vasopressor infusion at ICU admission.
Among them, 140 (58%) had a vasopressin infusion and 228 had a norepinephrine infusion
(95%). The median [IQR] norepinephrine equivalent dose was 25 [10, 38] μg per minute.
Patients with vasopressors at the end of surgery were older, had a higher baseline MELD, a
lower hemoglobin concentration and received less often a phlebotomy (Table 1). They also
had a longer surgery with more blood loss, higher volumes of infused fluid, a higher volume of
drained ascites and more red blood cell transfusions (Table 1). However, patients with vasopressors at the end of surgery had a lower fluid balance (mean (SD) of 0.2 L (3.9)) compared to
patients without vasopressors (mean (SD) of 1.1 L (3.3)) (p = 0.015, Fig 1).
We provided descriptive outcome results in Table 2 and results from our models in Tables
3–5 and S3 and S4 Tables in S3 Appendix. For our primary outcome, neither the presence nor
the dose of vasopressors at the end of surgery was associated with 48-hour AKI (Table 3).
Vasopressor did not modify the effect of fluid balance and fluid balance was not associated
with 48-hour AKI.
For our secondary outcomes, neither vasopressors at the end of surgery nor fluid balance
was associated with 7-day AKI (Table 3). Vasopressor did not modify the effect of fluid balance
on 7-day AKI. However, vasopressors use at the end of surgery significantly modified the fluid

balance effect on two of our secondary outcomes: risk of postoperative RRT and 1-year survival (Tables 4 and 5). In patients with vasopressors, fluid balance and dose of vasopressors
were not associated with the risk of postoperative RRT, while in the subgroup of patients without vasopressors, a higher fluid balance was significantly associated with a higher risk of postoperative RRT (OR = 1.52 [1.15, 2.01]), p for interaction < 0.001, (Table 4)). For our 1-year
survival outcome, a higher fluid balance was significantly associated with a higher mortality
(HR = 1.71 [1.26, 2.34]) in patients without vasopressors. However, in patients with vasopressors, a higher fluid balance was not associated with mortality (HR = 1.24 [0.99, 1.53]) while
higher doses of vasopressors were (HR = 1.29 [1.13, 1.47] per 10 μg/min of norepinephrine)
(Table 5 and S3 Fig in S3 Appendix). Fluid balance had thus a lesser effect on mortality in the
subgroup of patients with vasopressors (p < 0.01 for interaction) (Table 5).

Vasopressors at the end of surgery use did not modify the effect of fluid balance on our
time to extubation and time to ICU discharge outcomes. The presence of any vasopressor
at the end of surgery was associated with a lower risk of being extubated in the ICU
(HR = 0.64 [0.51, 0.81]) while fluid balance did not have any effect (S3 Table in S3 Appendix). Vasopressors use were not associated with a lower risk of being discharge from ICU
(HR = 0.91 [0.76, 1.09]), but a higher fluid balance was associated with a lower risk of
being discharge from ICU (non-linear effect, p < 0.001) (S4 Table and S4 Fig in S3
Appendix).
In our sensitivity analyses, results were robust for most outcomes (S5 and S6 Tables in S3
Appendix). For the time to ICU discharge, vasopressors had an effect when analyzed as a continuous variable (HR = 0.92 [0.87, 0.97] per 10 μg/min of norepinephrine) (S5 Table in S3
Appendix). For our time to extubation outcome, the presence of vasopressor had no more a

Effects of hemodynamic management in liver transplantation

Discussion
This study evaluated the association between intraoperative hemodynamic management and
postoperative outcomes in adult liver transplantations. Neither vasopressors nor fluid balance
had any effect on AKI. The presence of vasopressors attenuated the effect of fluid balance on
the risk of RRT and on survival. A higher fluid balance was associated with a higher risk of
RRT only in patients without vasopressors. Both higher doses of vasopressors and a higher
fluid balance were associated with a lower survival and the effect of fluid balance was worse in
patients without vasopressors.
The observation that a higher fluid balance was associated with an increased risk of RRT
and an increased risk of dying only in the subgroup of patients without vasopressors may suggest that either fluid balance had less effect when patients are hemodynamically unstable and
received vasopressors or that a restrictive fluid management strategy that includes a liberal use
of vasopressors might improve outcomes. Indeed, we observed a lower fluid balance in patients
with vasopressors although they were sicker and had higher intraoperative blood loss. This
observation might suggest that some of these patients were exposed to a more restrictive fluid
management strategy that included a more liberal use of vasopressors. A similar association
between fluid management strategies and need for vasopressors has already been suggested in
other major surgeries [15, 20]. Because vasopressor use is so closely correlated to the use of
fluid, further work is needed to better understand its effects in the context of a restrictive fluid
management strategy.
Previous studies have suggested that vasopressors use were associated with worse outcomes
after liver transplantation [32–34]. Other studies suggested that intraoperative hypotension
and hemodynamic instability were also associated with worse postoperative outcomes [8–10].
In our study, patients who remained on vasopressors at the end of surgery had more blood
loss and longer surgeries, suggesting that vasopressors are potentially markers of a more

There were 283 patients with 17 death events in the subgroup without vasopressor and 244 patients with 18 death
events in the subgroup with vasopressors. These results come from stratified multivariable models. Both Cox models
were fitted with a propensity score for exposure to a phlebotomy (preoperative hemoglobin value, preoperative
creatinine value, baseline CVP, age, preoperative MELD score and transplantation for acute liver failure). Model B
with vasopressor doses was also stratified for vasopressin infusion and exposure to a phlebotomy (for proportionality
reasons).

difficult intraoperative clinical course with more intraoperative hemodynamic instability. The
observed association between vasopressors and longer time before extubation, ICU discharge
and worse survival is thus probably not causal. Even if vasopressors were markers of hemodynamic instability and severity of the underlying clinical course, their liberal use might have
allowed a more restrictive fluid management strategy for the same hemodynamic goals as suggested by our observations. This hypothesis would be in line with similar observed effects in
this population [13]. However, in this study, the effect of an intentional use of vasopressors to
reduce intraoperative fluid balance may not be differentiated from the effect of vasopressors
use in the context of hemodynamic instability.
The main strength of this study was the evaluation of the effects of a surrogate of the intraoperative hemodynamic management on the incidence of postoperative outcomes in liver transplantation; such a work had never been done in this population. We also used several strategies
to limit biases by inclusion of consecutive patients and by limiting our exclusion criteria to
patients for whom classification of the primary outcome was impossible (patients on RRT prior
to transplantation). Classification of exposures and outcomes were made from a mix of prospectively collected and retrospectively extracted data from clinical charts, ensuring high-quality data.
Finally, multiple sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of our findings.
As for the limitations, we acknowledge a residual risk of non-differential classification bias
if data was incorrectly entered in the clinical chart. Our fluid balance exposure is a composite
exposure including the total volume of bleeding in the surgical suctions, which includes some
ascites that is impossible to measure. This could have misclassified this variable by an artificial
increase of the bleeding volume in the sicker patient with higher amount of ascites. Also, our
fluid balance variable captured similar fluid balance in patients with different blood loss and
could have induced non-differential classification bias in any direction. Many residual potential confounders might influence the association between intraoperative fluid balance or vasopressor doses and our outcomes. For example, we did not capture vasopressor doses at
different periods of the surgery, such as during the dissection phase when a phlebotomy is
used in around 50% of the patients, acute hemodynamics changes and their severity, pre-emptive actions based on surgical maneuvers and the clinical feeling of anesthesiologists, all important decision-making variables that might affect fluid administration and intraoperative
vasopressor use. Vasopressors were also used to treat hemodynamic instability and we did not
include any intraoperative hemodynamic variable in our models. We however adjusted our
statistical models for many selected covariables potentially associated with both exposure and
outcome outside the causal pathway. This study was conducted in only one center, which limits its generalizability to other populations. Finally, we conducted multiple statistical testing
that could have produced significant results by chance alone. Thus, only robust and concordant results should be interpreted accordingly.
In conclusion, this study provides new information regarding the effects of intraoperative
fluid and vasopressor administration on the postoperative course of liver transplant recipients.
The liberal use of vasopressors to implement a restrictive fluid management strategy is a potential therapeutic avenue for these patients and deserves further investigation.
