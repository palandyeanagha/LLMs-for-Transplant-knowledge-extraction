Abstract
We report studies that suggest enzyme replacement therapy
will result in a significant reduction in disease progression
and tissue pathology in patients with Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome (Mucopolysaccharidosis type VI, MPS VI). A feline
model for MPS VI was used to evaluate tissue distribution
and clinical efficacy of three forms of recombinant human
N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase (rh4S, EC 3.1.6.1). Intravenously administered rh4S was rapidly cleared from circulation. The majority of rh4S was distributed to liver, but was
also detected in most other tissues. Tissue half-life was z 2–
4 d. Three MPS VI cats given regular intravenous infusions
of rh4S for up to 20 mo showed variable reduction of storage vacuoles in Kupffer cells and connective tissues, however cartilage chondrocytes remained vacuolated. Vertebral
bone mineral volume was improved in two MPS VI cats in
which therapy was initiated before skeletal maturity, and
increased bone volume appeared to correlate with earlier
age of onset of therapy. One cat showed greater mobility in
response to therapy. (J. Clin. Invest. 1996. 97:1864–1873.)

Introduction
The mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS)1 are a group of devastating
genetic disorders, characterized at the cellular level by the
storage of mucopolysaccharides in the lysosomes of most cell
types. Storage results from a deficiency of 1 of 10 lysosomal
enzymes required for the lysosomal degradation of mucopolysaccharides. The MPS affect children in their first few
years of life and may lead to their death usually before their
10th year (1). The MPS have an overall incidence of 1:15,000
births with individual MPS types showing variable incidence
from 1:30,000 for MPS III to greater than 1:100,000 for MPS
VI (2, 3). The MPS are a subgroup of lysosomal storage disorders (LSD) which have an overall incidence of 1:5,000 births.
Clinical phenotypes observed within each MPS type vary from
relatively mild to extremely severe.
Mucopolysaccharidosis type VI (MPS VI, MaroteauxLamy syndrome), first described in 1965 (4), is due to a deficiency in N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase which results in
the accumulation of dermatan sulfate within lysosomes (1). Severely affected MPS VI patients are usually diagnosed under
two years of age, with clinical features that include gross abnormalities of the skeleton and heart, joint stiffness, cloudy
corneas, hepatosplenomegaly, dermatan sulfaturia, and premature death usually in late childhood to early adulthood.
Mildly affected MPS VI patients, with similar organ involvement, live into their forties and fifties.
For the majority of LSD, the only therapy available for patients has been bone marrow transplantation, and this has
been with limited clinical and biochemical evidence of success
(5, 6). Early attempts at enzyme replacement therapy (ERT)
for LSD patients were unsuccessful because insufficient enzyme doses were administered and enzymes lacked appropriate signals for efficient endocytosis, and therefore failed to
reach lysosomes of cells demonstrating pathology (7). More
recently, clinical efficacy of ERT was demonstrated in the
LSD Type I Gaucher disease, using glucocerebrosidase prepared from human placenta, modified to expose a-mannosides
to achieve specific and efficient uptake into macrophage-type
cells via a mannoside receptor (8, 9). Unlike severely affected
MPS I, II, and VII patients, MPS VI patients generally lack
central nervous system involvement. Therefore, as administered enzyme does not need to cross the blood brain barrier,
MPS VI is potentially more amenable to ERT than other MPS,
and is also an excellent model to evaluate the efficacy of ERT.
MPS VI has been observed in cats (10, 11) and rats (12).
The feline model of MPS VI provides a valuable opportunity
to evaluate proposed therapies since the pathology closely parallels that found in humans (10, 11). ERT has recently been
evaluated in a murine model of MPS VII using recombinant
murine b-D-glucuronidase (13, 14). Lysosomal storage of glycosaminoglycans was prevented or delayed in hepatocytes,
Kupffer cells, spleen, heart, and kidney interstitial cells and
retinal pigment epithelium, but not in corneal stroma, aortic
media and chondrocytes (14). There was also decreased lysosomal storage in some central nervous system cells including
neurons compared with no decrease in neuronal storage following bone marrow transplantation in young adult MPS VII
mice (15). ERT in MPS I dogs reduced lysosomal storage in
hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, spleen and some cells in the renal
glomeruli, but no improvement in brain, heart valves, cornea,
and chondrocytes was observed (16). Dogs were injected intravenously weekly for 3 mo at very low doses compared with the

ERT trials in MPS VII mice. These studies are promising and
indicate ERT will prove valuable in treatment of LSD patients.
N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase was originally purified
and characterized from human liver (17, 18), and subsequently
full length cDNA clones isolated (19, 20). Stably transfected
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells secrete large amounts of
recombinant h4S (rh4S) (21) in cell culture. The mannose-6-
phosphate receptor was shown to mediate uptake of CHO
rh4S in skin fibroblasts by inhibition studies with mannose-6-
phosphate (21). rh4S from a CHO cell derived mutant, the
LEC-1 cell line, which has altered N-linked glycosylation due
to a lack of N-acetylglucosamine-transferase (22) was equally
inhibited by the same concentration of mannose-6-phosphate.
However, uptake into rat alveolar macrophages was inhibited
by z 60% by mannan for LEC rh4S only, indicating differences in glycosylation between CHO and LEC rh4S (M.
Fuller, unpublished observations).
We now report the tissue distribution of three forms of
rh4S in normal cats, and the results of long term ERT in MPS
VI cats using two of these rh4S forms.
Methods
Enzyme production and purification. A rh4S construct using the human polypeptide-chain-elongation factor-1a gene promoter (23) was
inserted into CHO and LEC-1 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) to express CHO rh4S and LEC rh4S respectively. Culture medium from both expression cell lines was harvested
and purified (21), using monoclonal antibody F58.3 (24) in place of
ASB 4.1. Enzyme used for distribution studies was purified using a
four column procedure, to the same degree of purification (unpublished). Enzyme, concentrated over an Amicon YM-10 membrane
and sterile filtered into phosphate buffered saline (PBS) ready for injection, was assayed for activity within 24 h of use, using the fluorogenic substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate (18) (MUS) (Sigma
Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO). The mean specific activity of CHO
rh4S was 26,22066,025 nmol/min/mg (n 5 32) and for LEC rh4S was
29,93067,250 nmol/min/mg (n 5 15). Enzyme dose was calculated according to enzyme activity. Purified enzyme was stored at 48C until
use. To ensure uniformity of purified rh4S, each preparation was run
on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and, as previously shown
(21), all preparations contained a mixture of z 70% precursor (66
kD) and 30% mature (57, 43, 7, and 8 kD) polypeptides. There were
no other polypeptides observed.
A portion (5 mg) of the purified LEC rh4S had the terminal phosphate of the carbohydrate chain removed (denoted by LEC-P) by coincubation with 11 mg bovine intestinal alkaline phosphatase (EC
3.1.3.1, Type VII-N; Sigma Chemical Co.) in dimethylglutarate buffer
at pH 6 for 16 h at 378C. It was then run on a F58.3 monoclonal antibody column as above and dialyzed into PBS and assayed for activity
ready for injection. Specific activity remained unchanged following
dephosphorylation (32,590 nmol/min per mg).
Experimental animals. All animals used in these studies were
bred in an outdoor housed colony originally established from heterozygotes obtained from M. Haskins (School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA) (11). Normal cats
were identified as having peripheral leukocyte feline 4-sulfatase (f4S)
levels within normal limits, while MPS VI cats had non detectable
levels of f4S in peripheral leukocytes and excreted excessive amounts
of urinary dermatan sulfate. f4S activities were measured using radiolabeled trisaccharide substrate (18).
Disease progression in MPS VI cats. In the colony maintained for
these studies we have observed 38 MPS VI affected cats for various
durations. Clinical presentation and severity were variable as reported
previously (25, 26). At birth, MPS VI kittens were usually indistinguishable from their unaffected littermates, however a small proportion had lower birth weights. By 6–8 wk of age, features characteristic
of MPS VI started to become discernible and were clearly apparent
by 3 mo of age. Features included very mild corneal opacity, broad
face with shortened nose, small ears, short neck and tail, reduced
body length, and weight, abdominal distention, reduced flexibility of
the cervical spine and coxofemoral joints, and variable degrees of
pectus excavatum and kyphosis of the thoracolumbar spine. Permanent hindlimb neurological deficits of varying severity due to spinal
cord compression were observed in z 60% of untreated MPS VI cats
with onset at 4–5 mo of age, compared with spinal cord dysfunction in
z 25% of MPS VI cats observed by Haskins et al. (25).
Enzyme administration and clinical evaluation in MPS VI cats.
Three MPS VI cats were injected intravenously with two forms of
rh4S (CHO and LEC) with therapy starting at between 2 and 12 mo,
and in two cats with variable dose rates at different times (see Table
III). An untreated MPS VI cat was included as a control.
In the last 4 mo of therapy, premedication with 2 mg/cat of chlorpheniramine maleate (Niramine®, Jurox Pty Ltd, Silverwater, NSW)
was given to all cats subcutaneously (SC) prophylactically. Enzyme
was infused in a volume of 2–10 mls (diluted with PBS) into the cephalic vein over a period of 5–20 min. If signs suggestive of developing anaphylaxis occurred, enzyme infusion was stopped and reinstituted within 30 min.
A clinical and neurological examination was done on a monthly
basis, and slit lamp examinations of the corneas were performed in
the conscious animals on three occasions (at 19, 20, and 23 mo in cats
A and B and at 7, 8, and 11 mo in cat C).
The following four standard radiographic views were taken of
each cat: lateral cervical spine, lateral lumbar spine, lateral right hind
limb, and ventrodorsal pelvis. These were done under general anesthesia (xylazine, Rompun® Bayer Australia Ltd Artarmon NSW, 1.1–
2.2 mg/kg SC and ketamine, Ketamine Injection® Parnell Laboratories (Aust.) Pty Ltd Alexandria NSW, 20–33 mg/kg SC) at three
monthly intervals using detail intensifying screens at a constant focal
film distance.
Urine samples were collected by manual bladder expression with
xylazine sedation (0.5 mg/kg intravenously (IV) or 1–2 mg/kg SC) or
general anesthesia while undergoing radiological procedures. Samples were stored without preservative at 2208C until assayed. Urine
creatinine was assayed using an autoanalyzer method (Beckman Sychron CX® Systems). Total urine glycosaminoglycan content was
quantitated using a modified alcian blue spectrophotometric method
(27) and the concentration of urinary glycosaminoglycan in the sample was expressed as mg/mmol creatinine. Densitometric estimations
of the approximate relative proportions of dermatan sulfate were determined from high resolution electrophoresis on cellulose acetate
strips (28). This was then used to calculate the dermatan sulfate content in the original urine sample.
Blood samples for determination of antibody titer to rh4S were
collected on a monthly basis into EDTA or lithium heparin anticoagulant directly before enzyme administration. Plasma was separated
by centrifugation (1600 g for 5 min) at room temperature. On one occasion plasma samples were collected from cat A before rh4S infusion, then at 30 and 60 min post infusion and processed as above.
Samples were stored at 2208C until assayed. An ELISA assay using
96-well polyvinylchloride plates precoated with purified rh4S and an
anti–cat horseradish peroxidase–labeled secondary antibody was
used to titrate out antibodies to rh4S in the plasma samples (unpublished method).
To determine the effect of the high antibody titer feline plasma
(from cat A) on rh4S activity, constant amounts of rh4S were titrated
against feline plasma and a control rabbit anti-4-sulfatase polyclonal
antisera, and the 4-sulfatase activity of the resulting complex measured by MUS substrate reaction. Various amounts of plasma from
cat A, or rabbit anti-4-sulfatase polyclonal antibody (29) (0, 1, 5, 10,
15, and 20 ml of antibody) were added to 50 nmol/min/ml of rh4S in

1866 Crawley et al.
0.02 M Tris/HCl, pH 7.0 containing 0.25 M NaCl and 1% (wt/vol)
ovalbumin, in a total volume of 40 ml and incubated at 48C for 2 h. 100
ml of MUS substrate (5 mM) was added to each sample and incubated
at 378C for 20 min (18). To determine 4-sulfatase activity the level of
substrate conversion (release of methylumbelliferone) was measured
in a Perkin-Elmer spectrofluorometer at 446 nm using an excitation
wavelength of 366 nm. Results were expressed as activity units in
nmol/min per ml.
Skin biopsies were taken from cats A and B at 9 mo of age under
general anesthesia. This was 7 wk after onset of enzyme administration in cat A. This was repeated in both cats at 12 mo of age, before
the onset of enzyme administration in cat B.
Cats A and B were killed at 27 mo, 7 d after last enzyme injection,
and cat C at 15 mo, 4 d after last enzyme injection, using an overdose
of IV barbiturate. Tissues were collected (whole organs where possible) and weighed for determination of rh4S distribution then frozen
at 2208C until assayed. Samples were also taken for light and electron microscopy. For light microscopy, tissues were fixed in 10% formalin for 3–6 h then transferred into 70% alcohol and were processed
and stained with hematoxylin and eosin routinely within 96 h. Electron microscopy samples were minced to 1 mm3
 or less and fixed in
1% glutaraldehyde/4% formalin in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer
pH 7.2 for 2–3 h at room temperature then postfixed in 1% osmium
tetroxide, dehydrated and embedded in Spurrs resin. 1-mm-thick sections were stained with toluidine blue and then ultrathin sections
stained with 2% uranyl acetate/1% lead citrate and examined with a
Hitachi H-7000 electron microscope. An untreated MPS VI cat and a
normal cat were killed at 30 mo of age and were used as controls for
light and electron microscopy. The L5 vertebra was also removed,
fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in methylmethacrylate resin before sectioning using routine methods. Undecalcified tissue sections
(7 mm) were stained with von Kossa to visualize mineralized bone.
Sections were visually scanned to ensure integrity. Each vertebra was
analyzed at a magnification of 346 using an automated image analysis system (Quantimet 520 system, version 4.0; Cambridge Instruments). Mean values were calculated for each vertebra. Bone volume,
trabecular number and trabecular spacing were calculated using standard morphometric formulae (30).
Distribution studies. Seven normal cats (12–24 mo old) were sedated with 0.25 mg atropine sulfate and 0.5 mg acepromazine maleate
SC (Anamav®; Mavlab Pty Ltd., Slacks Creek, Qld, Australia). Anesthesia was induced by IV Saffan® (alphaxalone 9 mg/ml and alphadolone acetate 3 mg/ml; Jurox Pty Ltd., Silverwater, NSW, Australia at
z 9 mg/kg) and maintained on halothane. The femoral artery was
cannulated using polyethylene tubing (PE 50; Dural Plastics and Engineering, Auburn, NSW, Australia) attached to a three-way tap
filled with heparinized saline. Purified rh4S at dose 1 mg/kg (CHO,
LEC, and LEC-P) or z 7.5 mg/kg (CHO at 7.3 mg/kg and LEC at
7.95 mg/kg) was infused into the cephalic vein in a volume of 7 ml
over 40 s, with time zero taken from 20 s. Serial 1-ml heparinized
blood samples were collected from the femoral artery for up to 2 h after enzyme infusion. Samples were centrifuged (1600 g for 3 min) at
208C within 2–5 min of sampling, plasma collected and the buffy layer
was removed and immediately washed by resuspending in saline. The
buffy layer samples were recentrifuged (as above) and then separated
from any contaminating red blood cells using dextran sedimentation
(31) within 2–4 h of sampling. Buffy layer and plasma samples were
then stored at 2208C until assayed. Polyethylene tubing and threeway taps were flushed with heparinized saline between sampling
times. After 4 h, cats were killed using an overdose of intravenous
barbiturate. Tissues were collected (whole organs where possible),
weighed and then frozen at 2208C until assayed.
Three normal cats (8–66 mo old) were injected intravenously with
7 ml CHO rh4S at 1 mg/kg at 2, 4, and 7 d before killing. One additional normal cat was used for detection of f4S levels in tissues and
was not exposed to rh4S. Killing and tissue collection was performed
as above.
Tissue preparation and analysis. Preparation of tissue extracts,
detection of rh4S in feline tissues, white cells and plasma, and detection of f4S in normal control cat tissues were according to methods
described previously (24). Briefly, this involved binding sheep antimouse immunoglobulin to a 96-well polyvinylchloride plate, then
adding a second layer of either a human specific monoclonal antibody
(F66) to detect rh4S, or a polyclonal anti-h4S antibody (that cross reacts with f4S) to detect f4S. Tissue extracts were then applied to the
plates and MUS substrate used to determine rh4S/f4S activity fluorometrically. Limits of detection for the assay were 4.5 3 1023
 nmol/
min. During the development of this assay procedure, a nondialyzable inhibitor of 4S activity was shown to be present in cat liver (24).
The method clearly overcame the influence of this inhibitor.
Results
Distribution in normal cats infused with rh4S. Three forms
(CHO, LEC, and LEC-P) of rh4S with different glycosylation
structures were evaluated for plasma half-life and tissue distribution. At 1 mg/kg, LEC rh4S was cleared from circulation by
20–30 min (Fig. 1), as was CHO and LEC-P (data not shown).
At z 7.5 mg/kg there was a dose dependent clearance of CHO
rh4S (Fig. 1) and LEC rh4S (data not shown), with rh4S activity in plasma detectable for up to 120 min. Plasma half-life for
all forms of rh4S at 1 mg/kg was 13.763.2 min, and for CHO
and LEC rh4S at z 7.5 mg/kg was approximately 45 min. At
either dose, and for all three forms, rh4S could not be detected
in peripheral blood leukocytes.
4 h after administration of 1 mg/kg, the tissue distribution
of all forms of rh4S was similar (Table I) with the majority of
the infused rh4S found in the liver. Significant levels of rh4S
were also observed in spleen, lung, kidney, heart, skin, aorta,
cerebrum, cerebellum, and lymph node compared to f4S levels
in a normal control (Tables I and II). Increased dose resulted
in a proportional increase in levels of rh4S in all tissues.
Minor differences were noted in the distribution pattern
for CHO and LEC rh4S. Proportionally more CHO rh4S was
detected in lung (ninefold) and skin (twofold), whereas LEC
rh4S activity was detectable in cartilage and cornea (Table II).
Dephosphorylation of rh4S (LEC-P) resulted in lower enzyme
activities in all tissues, however the pattern of distribution remained consistent (Table II). Uptake studies in the THP-1
monocyte cell line (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) demonstrated uptake of LEC rh4S was completely

inhibited by mannose-6-phosphate whereas uptake of LEC-P
rh4S was not observed into these cells (data not shown).
Tissue half-life evaluated for CHO rh4S only, was estimated to be 2–4 d in liver, spleen, lung, kidney and heart (Fig.
2, A, B, and C). At 1 mg/kg, low but detectable levels of CHO
rh4S were observed in liver, spleen, lung, and kidney 7 d after
infusion (Figs. 2, A, B, and C), but rh4S was not detectable in
heart, skin, aorta and brain (data not shown).
Disease progression in MPS VI cats undergoing ERT.
Three MPS VI cats (A, B, and C) were treated with two forms
of rh4S, with the onset of therapy at different ages according to
the protocol (Table III).
In cat A, mild hindlimb paresis was evident by 4 mo which
progressed to almost complete hindlimb paralysis with hypertonicity and extension of the hindlimbs by 7 mo. Localization
of the upper motor neuron lesion was not performed. ERT
was instituted at 7 mo as an alternative to killing. After 4 wk,
cat A was very mobile and using hindlimbs normally although
no neurological examination was performed. By 10 mo, cat A
deteriorated exhibiting progressive hindlimb paresis eventuating in absence of extensor postural thrust. At 16 mo mobility
and proprioception was unexpectedly improved in hindlimbs,
with presence of extensor postural thrust, patellar hyperreflexia, delayed proprioceptive positioning, and a staggery unsteady gait. In subsequent months, use of his hindlimbs and
presence of extensor postural thrust was intermittent/variable
but improved mobility with greatly increased activity occurred

at 22 mo after increasing the enzyme dose to 2 mg/kg. Cat B
did not appear to develop any neurological deficits, although
gait and mobility were altered due to progression of skeletal
disease. Cat B remained the most mobile of all three cats. ERT
started at 2 mo of age in cat C, at which time only mild features
of MPS VI were evident. Very mild hindlimb paresis was first
noticed at 6 mo and progressed marginally such that the extensor postural thrust was slightly slower than normal. By 9 mo
cat C was usually sedentary and the most inactive of the three,
but was still able to walk reasonably well with a paretic gait.
Slit lamp examination of the corneas of all three cats
showed a mild degree of corneal opacity which did not change
during therapy. Radiographic changes in all three cats were
similar to the MPS VI cats described by Konde et al. (26), with
epiphyseal dysplasia resulting in severe degeneration of vertebral bodies particularly in the cervical spine, hypoplasia and
fragmentation of the dens, small deformed proximal humeral,
distal femoral, and proximal and distal tibial epiphyses, coxofemoral subluxation and remodeling of the acetabula and
femoral heads, pectus excavatum, and reduced cortical thickness of long bones. Moderate to severe kyphosis of the lumbar
spine occurred in all three cats. All lesions progressed with
age. There were no significant radiographic improvements in
the skeletal pathology of all three treated cats after treatment.
Bone morphometry. Parameters of trabecular bone development were determined from the fifth lumbar (L5) vertebra.
Bone mineral volume correlated with age of onset of therapy,
and in cat C (onset of ERT at 2 mo) bone volume was closest
to that of normal cat vertebra, compared with cat A (onset of
ERT at 7 mo). Bone volume in cat B, in which therapy was initiated after skeletal maturity (onset of ERT at 12 mo) was no
different from untreated MPS VI cat D (Table IV). Trabecular
number was improved in all the treated cats and showed the
same trend associated with the age of onset of ERT, but values
were still less than the normal control. Trabecular spacing was
also improved in cats treated prior to skeletal maturity (cats A
and C, Table IV).
Antibody response. All cats exhibited restlessness, trembling, and increased respiratory rate to varying extents, indicating possible development of hypersensitivity, but none
developed typical anaphylactic reactions during therapy. Antibody titers tended to increase after the initiation of ERT, and
ranged up to 1,024,000 in cat A, 64,000 in cat B, and 64,000 in
cat C. Titers fluctuated after reaching high levels, and did not
appear to correlate with clinical appearance of the treated cats,
such as improved or reduced mobility. Values in age matched
untreated normal control cats ranged from 4,096–32,000.
Therefore only cat A showed antibody titers significantly
above the control.
In an experiment 8 mo after onset of therapy, administration of rh4S to cat A resulted in a reduction in antibody titer
from . 512,000 before rh4S infusion, to 2,048 by 30 min and
1,024 by 60 min after rh4S infusion.
Inhibition of rh4S activity by plasma from a high titer cat.
Plasma from cat A (titer 1,024,000) and a specific 4-sulfatase
rabbit polyclonal were able to inhibit the activity of rh4S in a
dose dependent manner. The addition of the same amounts of
fetal bovine serum to rh4S had no detectable effect on 4-sulfatase activity (Fig. 3).
Urinary glycosaminoglycans. At 400 d of age, the total glycosaminoglycan content in the urine of treated MPS VI cat A
was approximately midway between that of the normal control
cats and the untreated MPS VI cat D (Fig. 4 A), and in treated
cats B and C was approximately equal to that of the normal

control cats (Fig. 4, B and C). At just under 400 d of age, the
urine dermatan sulfate content from cats A, B, and C was approximately midway between that of the untreated MPS VI
cat D and the normal control cats. Cats A and B had slightly
higher dermatan sulfate levels than cat C (Fig. 5, A, B, and C).
Gross pathology. Cats A, B, and C all developed physical
features consistent with untreated MPS VI cats observed in
the colony. Abdominal distention was prominent in cats A and
C due to the shortened body length. Cats A, B, and C weighed
2.8, 3.0, and 2.5 kg, respectively, at death compared with a normal adult male weight range of 4–7 kg.
The abdominal organs of all three cats appeared normal,
with no evidence of hepatomegaly. Heart valves in all three
cats were not grossly thickened compared with normal cats.
There was diffuse or irregular whiteness of articular cartilage
due to variable cartilage thickness in the femorotibial, coxofemoral and shoulder joints. Cartilage also appeared loosely
attached and was easily removed from the subchondral bone
in cats A and B. In cat A there was evidence of cartilage flap
formation in one femoral head and in one humeral head. Underlying subchondral bone appeared white and avascular and
in many areas, plugs of cartilage remained in subchondral
bone. The articular surface of the proximal humerus also had

Discussion
With the anticipation of ERT clinical trials with rh4S in human
MPS VI patients, the aim of the experiments reported here
was to evaluate distribution and fate of three variably glycosylated forms of rh4S and the efficacy of therapy with two of
these forms in 4-sulfatase deficient MPS VI cats.
4 h after infusion of 1 mg/kg CHO rh4S, enzyme activity
was highest in the liver followed by spleen, lung and kidney,
with levels of rh4S in these tissues above the level of f4S in a
normal control cat. Trends observed in tissue distribution were
comparable to those found in b-D-glucuronidase infused MPS
VII mice (14) b-D-hexosaminidase infusion into normal cats
(32), and a-L-iduronidase infusion into MPS I dogs (16). These
studies showed highest levels of infused lysosomal enzymes in
the liver followed generally by spleen then lung or kidney then
heart.
Although the glycosylation structures were not characterized, CHO rh4S is thought to have undergone complex oligosaccharide modifications and phosphorylation of terminal
mannose structures. Conversely high mannose structures of
LEC rh4S have undergone phosphorylation but no complex
oligosaccharide modifications. The mannose-6-phosphate receptor which recognizes phosphomannosyl terminating oligosaccharides, is involved in lysosomal enzyme targeting and is
found in many cell types including fibroblasts, myoblasts and
hepatocytes (33, 34). Other cell surface receptors recognizing
different carbohydrate structures include the mannose/Nacetylglucosamine receptor found in tissue macrophages and
the asialogalactose receptor in hepatocytes (34).
In these studies, CHO, LEC and LEC-P rh4S produced
only minor differences in uptake, with the overall pattern of
distribution being similar for each form. CHO and LEC rh4S
may have used the mannose-6-phosphate receptor for cell uptake however other receptors may also have been involved.
LEC and CHO rh4S were taken up by different receptors on
rat lung macrophages and it was hypothesized that different
uptake mechanisms reflected altered carbohydrate structures
on each rh4S form utilizing different cell surface receptors (M.
Fuller, unpublished observations). Consistent with the report
of Van der Ploeg et al. (35), that dephosphorylation of a-glucosidase completely inhibited uptake into skeletal and heart
muscle after intravenous administration to mice, LEC-P rh4S
appears to have reduced efficiency of enzyme uptake with
lower enzyme activities in tissues.
The minor differences in tissue distribution between CHO
and LEC rh4S did not appear to significantly alter the degree
of lysosomal vacuolation in the tissues of treated cats. Normalization of morphology in Kupffer cells (Fig. 6) has been demonstrated in other animal models undergoing ERT (14, 16).
The significant reduction in storage vacuoles in renal interstitial fibroblasts (Fig. 7) was not observed in MPS I dogs that underwent ERT (16). This may have been due to the lower dosage rates used in the MPS I dogs. Our study suggests that skin
biopsies may be a useful way of monitoring response to ERT
(Fig. 8). Reduction in lysosomal storage in dermal fibroblasts
was also observed by Navarro et al. (36) in a MPS I patient
who had undergone bone marrow transplantation 21 mo earlier. Lack of correction of storage seen clinically in the corneas
and demonstrated by electron microscopy in the chondrocytes
(Fig. 9) correlates with the results of our distribution studies,
as well as studies of ERT in other animal models (14, 16). The
reduction in urinary dermatan sulfate, although not completely normalized, correlated with the reduction in vacuolation seen in most tissues examined.
The estimated half-life of rh4S in cultured fibroblasts was
7–14 d (37) and this value was used to decide on the initial
dose frequency in all three treated cats. However the half-life
of CHO rh4S ranged from 2–4 d in selected tissues, suggesting
that the 7-d dose interval in cats A and B was more appropriate, than the two week interval used initially in cats A and B,

numerous enlarged lysosomes in a 15-mo-old untreated control MPS

the untreated MPS VI control there was a dramatic clearance of storage in Kupffer cells in the three treated cats and these cells appeared

and for the duration of ERT in cat C. Similar tissue half-lives
have been reported for bovine testes acid a-glucosidase in
mice (35) and for recombinant b-D-glucuronidase in MPS VII
mice (13).
Therapy was instituted in cats A and B after skeletal pathology was well established. Our studies show that at the dose
rates used, long term therapy was unable to significantly alter
the radiographic appearance of skeletal disease in these cats.
Progression of disease in cat C was clinically indistinguishable
from cats A and B, despite much earlier onset of therapy at
2 mo of age. This may reflect the different dose frequency
(fortnightly), or perhaps the clinical heterogeneity in MPS VI
cats observed within our colony and other colonies (26). However, using bone morphometry as a more objective measure,
increased bone volume appeared to correlate with earlier onset of therapy, with the highest value found in cat C (onset
ERT at 2 mo) followed by cat A (onset 7 mo) although values
still fell well below that of the normal control cat. ERT was unable to improve bone volume once skeletal maturity was

also showed reduction in the degree of fibroblast vacuolation in postmortem skin samples compared to skin biopsies taken around the 
time of onset of ERT (data not shown). Bar, 2 mm.

reached, as seen in cat B. A study investigating earlier onset of
therapy at increased dose and dose frequency is currently in
progress (unpublished).
The increased bone volume seen in the earliest treated cat,
cat C, may be due to improved enzyme availability to the
growth plate whilst undergoing rapid growth. The increased
trabecular number also seen in this cat conflicts with results
seen in bone marrow transplanted MPS VI cats where trabecular number appeared unchanged (38). Obviously this result
needs to be evaluated in more animals undergoing ERT. MPS
VII mice given multiple injections of b-D-glucuronidase improved in bone length but were not normalized and no morphometric data was reported (14). However, there may be important differences in growth plate regulation between animals
such as rats and mice, with open growth plates throughout life,
and those such as cats, dogs and humans, that show growth
plate closure on maturity. Therefore studies of skeletal pathology in the MPS and their response to therapy may be more appropriate in larger animal models with similar growth regulation to humans.
Improved mobility has been reported in patients following
bone marrow transplantation (39). The subjective improvement in mobility in one cat after onset of ERT, and after increased dose and frequency of dosing, may have been as a
result of a reduction in joint capsule storage, however, fluctuations in the use of hindlimbs in the same cat prior to ERT and
dose changes remain unexplained. Localization of spinal cord
compression at postmortem to the lower cervical/upper thoracic region in cat C differs from another report where MPS
VI cats had cord compression in the thoracolumbar region
(25). We have since observed spinal cord compression in the
cervicothoracic region of the majority of untreated MPS VI
cats as well as in the thoracolumbar region of some of these
cats (unpublished observations).
All cats tolerated enzyme administration with minimal side
effects, indicating the potential viability of long term ERT at
least in the feline model for MPS VI. It was not possible to correlate development of antibody titer and subsequent fluctuations with clinical well-being of the cats in this study. The dramatic reduction in antibody titer in cat A after enzyme
administration indicates antibody binding to the rh4S enzyme.
This antibody may have diminished the effectiveness of the
rh4S therapy in this cat as plasma antibody from the same cat
was able to inhibit rh4S activity in vitro. The rh4S/antibody
complex may also alter the availability and subsequent efficacy
of rh4S in the lysosomal compartment (40, 41). Analysis of
rh4S activity in tissues taken 7 d after enzyme infusion in cats
A and B showed that cat B had detectable rh4S in most tissues,
whereas cat A only had activity detectable in liver (data not
shown). This supports the hypothesis of reduced efficacy of
rh4S in the presence of high titer antibody as seen in cat A. In
future studies we will examine the intracellular fate of antibody bound rh4S and use f4S to evaluate any differences in antibody production and efficacy in MPS VI cats. The observed
natural titers of non-immune cats to rh4S is significant but not
unprecedented (42, 43, 44) and is also under further investigation.
In conclusion, our results show that there was response to
long term ERT histologically in liver, kidney and skin fibroblasts. There was no obvious reversal of skeletal changes radiographically, however there was a trend towards normalization of bone mineral volume in vertebral bone samples,
correlating with earlier onset of therapy. More extensive evaluation is needed in larger numbers of animals using increased
dose rates and frequency, with onset of treatment as soon as
possible after birth. The effect of antibody titer on efficacy of
therapy should be evaluated, and methods to improve penetration of enzyme to cartilage and cornea also need to be developed.
