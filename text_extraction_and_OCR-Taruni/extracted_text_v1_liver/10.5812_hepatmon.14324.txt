Background: More than 170 million people in the world are infected with Hepatitis C virus (HCV). Determination of HCV genotype before 
starting the treatment is required, because HCV genotype affects the course of treatment and drug dosage
Objectives: We aimed to evaluate HCV genotypes among patients with positive results for anti-HCV in Bandar Abbas from 2011 to 2012.
Patients and Methods: Five hundred and nine consecutive patients with established chronic HCV infection referred to Behavioral 
Diseases Consultation Center, Blood Transfusion and Center for Special Diseases from March 2011 to March 2012 were enrolled in this cross 
sectional study. Five mL of peripheral blood was taken from precipitants and viral RNA extracted after plasma separation. Hepatitis C virus 
RNA was detected by reverse transcriptase-nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-nested PCR) assay and then HCV genotypes analyzed 
using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method.
Results: In overall, 509 patients enrolled to this study. The mean age of these patients was 38.87 ± 9.55 years ranging from 1 to 90 years. Routs 
of transmission were: 238 (46.7%) inject of substance, 149 (29.3%) unknown rout, 62 (12.2%) blood transfusion, 50 (9.8%) sexual contact, and 
10 (2%) mother to child. Frequency of HCV genotypes were: 316 (62.1%) 1a, 117 (23%) 1b, and 76 (14.9%) 3a. there was no significant association 
between HCV genotypes and gender, educational degree, risk factor of Hepatitis C, job, monthly income, HIV infection, Hepatitis B virus 
(HBV) infection, Intravenous drug injection, and underlying disease (P > 0.05).
Conclusions: This results the same as many similar studies demonstrated that common HCV genotypes in Iranian patients were 1a, 3a 
and 1b, respectively. Patients with 1a and 1b genotypes have lower responses to interferon treatment, and it is reasonable to perform early 
screening to diagnose and determine HCV genotype for effective treatment and diagnose high-risk cases.
Keywords: Hepatitis C; Genotype; Iran
Implication for health policy/practice/research/medical education:
Determination of HCV genotypes is very critical for researchers and clinicians for decision in therapy and finding the main risk factors in the community. 
It helps the gastroenterologists and infectious specialists in daily practices.

1. Background
More than 170 million people worldwide are infected 
with Hepatitis C Virus (1). Hepatitis C is a blood-borne 
disease and the main risk factor is exposure to infected 
blood or blood products such as: transfusion with unscreened blood and blood products, needle-sharing 
among Intravenous (IV) drug abusers, and needle-stick 
injuries in health care workers. The most common cause 
of transmission is needle or syringe sharing among drug 
abusers with a prevalence between 31 to 89 percent according to different geographical areas. Risk of infection 
for some groups of patients such as, patients on hemodialysis, those with hemophilia infants of mothers with 
HCV infection, and multipartner individuals are dramatically higher. Prevalence of HCV among patients on hemodialysis in Iran is 5.5% to 55.9% in different cities, although 
this number for patients with hemophilia is 15.65 to 76.7%. 
HCV comprises six major genotypes (genotypes 1 to 6) 
and several subtypes (a, b, c, etc.) which have different 
geographical distribution (2). It is needed to determine 
HCV genotype prior to treatment, because this is the 
genotype which determines treatment period and drug 
dosage. In addition, genotype is an important preventive 
agent for probability of viral tolerance, and probability of 
obtaining and sustained virologic response (3).
There exists a certain geographical distribution of HCV 
genotypes. Genotype 1 is the most common one in the 
US and Europe; and genotypes 2 and 3 have the lowest 
prevalence in these regions and genotypes 4, 5, and 6 

Mousavi SF et al.

are rare. Genotype 3 is the most common in India, Far 
East and Australia. Genotype 4 is the most common 
in Africa, the Middle East, and it seems that the most 
common European type is related to IV drug abusers and 
homosexual males. Genotype 5 is the most common in 
southern Africa, and genotype 6 is the most common in 
Hong Kong, Vietnam and Australia (4-7). It sounds that 
the prevalence and incidence of different HCV genotypes 
in geographical regions and periods of time are due to 
distribution mode and evolution of risk factors (8).
Several studies were performed in Iran to explore this 
geographical distribution. In a study conducted by 
Joukar et al. (2009), in Guilan it was found that the most 
common genotypes among patients on hemodialysis are 
1a and 3a (59.38%) (9). Data gathered from 16 provinces 
in a study by Hajia et al. (2009), in Tehran indicated that 
the most prevalent genotype was 3a (46.6%) and then 
genotype 1 (1a, 1b with the prevalence of 25.73% and 17.47%) 
ranked the second. The findings of this study during 
four years showed that HCV infection with genotypes 
1b, 3a, has increased from 12.2% and 38.9% to 18.9% and 
46.5% in the fourth year (10). Another study performed 
by Samimi-Rad et al. (2008) in Markazi province revealed 
that the overall prevalence of Hepatitis C was 5.4% and the 
prevalent subtype among patients on hemodialysis was 
1a (50%), then genotypes such as 4 (25%), 3a (12.5%) and 1 b 
(12.5%) ranked second to fourth (11). Currently this disease 
is treated by pegylated IFN-α and Ribavirin which has 
severe side effects and its outcome depends totally on the 
HCV genotype (12-14).
2. Objectives
Based on the fact that HCV genotype varies in different geographical regions and since the type of effective 
treatment and response to treatment varies in different 
genotypes of this virus, these authors decided to investigate the distribution of HCV genotypes of patients with 
positive results for HCV in Hormozgan, 2011 to take more 
effective treatment decisions in this field.
3. Patients and Methods
3.1. Study Population
In this cross sectional study 509 patients with positive 
results for anti-HCV antibody and HCV-RNA tests referred 
to Behavioral Diseases Consultation Center, Blood 
Transfusion and Center for Special Diseases were enrolled 
between March 2011 and March 2012. The present study 
was approved by committee of medical student thesis 
of Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences (HUMS). 
Patients were informed about the study and then an 
informed consent was obtained from each participant. 
Inclusion criteria were positive results for plasma 
genomic HCV-RNA and anti-HCV antibodies. For all 
patients a two-part check list was prepared as follows: 
1. Questions regarding demographic information, 2. 
Questions about route of infection, time of diagnosis, 
presence of Blood born coinfections, underlying disease, 
addiction to drugs or previous abuse.
3.2. Sample Collection and RNA Extraction 
About 5 milliliter of peripheral blood was taken from 
each participant into EDTA-containing vacutainer tubes. 
Plasma was obtained from whole blood by centrifugation and storage at -80 °C for later detection. Viral RNA 
was extracted from plasma sample using High Pure Viral 
Nucleic Acid Kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, 
Germany), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 
3.3. cDNA Synthesis and Hepatitis C Virus Genotyping Using Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism Assay
The Genomic HCV-RNA in plasma sample was detected 
using reverse transcriptase-nested polymerase chain 
reaction (RT-nested PCR) method. cDNA synthesis from 
viral RNA and two round nested-PCR were performed as 
previously described elsewhere (15). 
Hepatitis C virus-genotypes were analyzed in RTnested PCR products using restriction fragment length 
polymorphism (RFLP) assay. The nested-PCR and 
RFLP assay were performed using primers from the 
5´-untranslated region (5´-UTR) as described previously 
by Pohjanpelto et al. in details (16). The second round 
of PCR products (173-bp) with digested PCR products by 
special restriction enzymes and appropriate controls 
with 50bp molecular weight size marker (Fermentas 
GmbH, St. Leon-Rot, Germany) were visualized using 3% 
agarose gel electrophoresis. Different HCV Genotypes 
were determined based on the molecular weight of each 
fragment of PCR product. The results of HCV genotyping 
by RFLP assay were confirmed by sequencing of 5´-UTR of 
HCV. The 5´-UTR was amplified from viral RNA extracted 
from plasma specimens of 10 randomly selected 
participants with Pfu DNA polymerase and the PCR 
products were sequenced using dye termination method 
by ABI 3730 XL sequencer.
3.4 Statistical Analysis
Data was analyzed by descriptive statistical methods 
(frequency, Standard Deviation, Mean) and statistical test 
Chi-square using SPSS version 13. 
4. Results
Totally 509 subjects took part in the present study. The 
average age was 38.87 ± 9.55 years ranging from 1 to 90 
years. Disease transmission methods in this study were 
IV drug abuse (%56.7, N = 238), unknown (29.3%, N = 149), 
transfusion (12.2%, N = 62), sexual contact with infected 
individuals (9.8%, N = 50), and mother to child (2%, N =

10) which this vertical transmission is more than previous results from other parts of Iran. Prevalence of HCV 
genotypes in these subjects was as follows: 316 (62.1%) 1a, 
117 (23%) 1b, and 76 (14.9%) 3a. Distribution of genotypes 
of hepatitis C with sex, HIV infection, hepatitis B (HBV) 
infection and underlying diseases has been illustrated in

5. Discussion
The most frequent genotypes in our study were 1a 
(62.1%), 1b (23%), and 3a (14.9%) respectively.
Some studies in Iran have reported different results. 
Genotype 3a (61.2%) was reported as the most frequent 
genotype in Isfahan province followed by 1a (29.5%) and 
1b (5.1%) genotypes (17). Alavian et al. reported the distribution of HCV genotypes as follows; genotype 1 in 57%, 
genotype 3 in 35%, and genotype 2 in 1%, and mixed genotype in 4% of Iranian patients with thalassemia (18).
The information about the prevalence of different HCV 
genotypes in Iran is variable according to the study population and geographical setting. We have summarized 
the results of some studies in Table 3. 
As shown in Table 3 the most frequent HCV genotypes in 
Iran were 1a and 3a. As shown in this table the frequency 
of HCV genotypes is variable based on study population 
and geographical areas. Some studies have focused on patients on hemodialysis and those with hemophilia, while 
others investigated patients with HCV referred to clinics.

(16.7%)
Also the results of studies in our neighborhood countries are different. One study in Turkey have reported 
genotype 1b in 84.7% of patients with HCV followed by 3a 
(4.2%) and 1 (3.8%), which is not compatible with our results (24). In Pakistan the most frequent genotypes were 
3a (40.96%), 3b (15.66%), and 1a (9.63%) respectively (25). 
In Saudi Arabia genotype 4 (50%) was the most common 
genotype followed by genotype 1b (40.9%), and 1a (9.1%) 
(26, 27). In China, one study on patients with HCV and 
HIV coinfection reported genotype 6a(39.3%) as the most 
frequent genotype followed by genotypes 1b (24.7%), 3b 
(18%), and 3a (9.8%) (28).
The present findings showed that there was no significant association between a variety of hepatitis C genotypes and gender, level of education, and risk factors for 
hepatitis C, job, income, HIV infection, HBV infection, IV 
drug abuse and presence of underlying diseases. In addition, the present findings indicated that there was no 
significant association between the types of HCV genotype and the underlying diseases. The results of the study 
by Amini et al. and Kabir et al. are in agreement with the 
present findings. They found no significant difference 
between the HCV genotypes and risk factors and demographic characteristics (22, 29). Keyvani et al. indicated 
an increase in frequency of genotype 1b with increasing 
age (21).
We did not find any significant association between 
HCV genotype and underlying diseases or complications 
of the disease. It is shown that patients with genotypes 1a 
and 1b tended to have more severe liver disease and lower 
response to interferon therapy (30). Also patients with 
genotype 1b are at higher risks for hepatocellular carcinoma (31). Alavian's study on patients with thalassemia 
and simultaneously HCV infection, showed that dominant genotype 1 may result in splenectomy and increased 
ferritin in blood (18). 
The importance of determination of the most frequent 
genotypes in each area is the differences in treatment response and prognosis of patients (32-36).
Our study showed that the most frequent genotypes of 
hepatitis C in Bandar Abbas are 1a, 1b, and 3a respectively. 
This frequency is different in other provinces in Iran and 
the neighboring countries. Therefore, we recommend 
more studies on the treatment options available for patients in each area based on the most frequent genotypes.
