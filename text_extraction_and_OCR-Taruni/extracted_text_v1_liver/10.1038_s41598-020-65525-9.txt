While there is a clear link between impairments of executive functions (EFs), i.e. cognitive control 
mechanisms that facilitate goal-directed behavior, and speech problems, it is so far unclear exactly 
which of the complex subdomains of EFs most strongly contribute to speech performance, as measured 
by verbal fuency (VF) tasks. Furthermore, the impact of intra-individual variability is largely unknown. 
This study on healthy participants (n=235) shows that the use of a relevance vector machine approach 
allows for the prediction of VF performance from EF scores. Based on a comprehensive set of EF scores, 
results identifed cognitive fexibility and inhibition as well as processing speed as strongest predictors 
for VF performance, but also highlighted a modulatory infuence of fuctuating hormone levels. These 
fndings demonstrate that speech production performance is strongly linked to specifc EF subdomains, 
but they also suggest that inter-individual diferences should be taken into account.
Executive functions (EFs) refer to a set of cognitive processes that allow for goal-directed behavior through the 
regulation of various cognitive subprocesses. Since EFs permeate behavior, they also impact daily activities as well 
as social and personal development, including school or job success1
. Te importance and pervasiveness of EFs 
has led diferent felds of study to investigate these control mechanisms with the goal of diferentiating the various subdomains of EFs. Tis, in turn, has resulted in a number of diferent conceptualizations based on diferent 
approaches, all attempting to subdivide EFs into diferent domains. While a consensus does not yet exist about 
how exactly to subdivide and name EFs, there is general agreement that there are three core EFs: (1) cognitive 
fexibility, (2) working memory and (3) inhibition1
 (but see Karr et al.
2,3
). Higher-order EFs, such as reasoning, 
planning and problem solving, are then built on the basis of these subdomains.
Te various sub-domains of EFs have been shown to be impaired in a number of neurological and psychiatric diseases, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)4
, Parkinson’s disease5, depression6
and schizophrenia7
. Diferent diseases present their own typical EF defcits and clinical diagnosis attempts to 
assess the specifc patterns of the disease. For example, in the case of Parkinson’s disease, patients sufer from 
difculties in dual-tasking which is refected in the defcient combination of memorizing and manipulation of 
thoughts and tasks8
 but also in impaired speech characterized by semantic paraphasias and reduced word fuency 
due to a lack of EFs5,9
. To assess these symptoms diferent test batteries have been developed. Tese batteries, 
which include tests tapping into the diferent EF sub-domains, are used for neuropsychological assessment in 
both clinical settings and lab-based environments. Commonly used batteries are the Delis-Kaplan Executive 
Function System (D-KEFS) and the Vienna Test System, both of which ofer a wide range of tests probing each 
of the EF sub-domains and have been independently validated10–12. Commonly used tasks tapping into the 
diferent sub-domains of EFs comprise the Wisconsin Card Sorting test (WCST), Tower of London (ToL) and 
Trail-Making test (TMT) to assess cognitive fexibility5,13,14, n-back tasks and the Corsi block tapping test to cover 
the sub-domain of working memory15,16 and the Stop-signal task or the Stroop test (color-word interference) to 
probe the sub-domain of inhibition. All of these are commonly used in the clinical5,17 as well as in the scientifc 
context14,18. Importantly, due to the overlap of the diferent domains of EFs, these tests cannot be assumed to 
target one specifc domain of EFs only.

Beside subdomain-specifc EF tests, clinical and research test batteries also include a speech-based task, 
namely the verbal fuency (VF) task but the explicit involvement of diferent EF subdomains in the VF task 
is reported controversially especially when considering inter-individual diferences19. Te well-established and 
ofen-used VF test assesses the number of words generated in a given time (usually 60 seconds) and has been 
found to be a sensitive measurement for testing EFs in both non-clinical groups19 as well as in neurological 
patients20. VF tests mainly comprise two types of tasks: Te phonemic/lexical VF, requiring the generation of as 
many words as possible beginning with a specifc letter (e.g. C, F); and semantic VF, in which the examinee is 
asked to produce words that belong to a specifc semantic category (e.g. fruits, animals). Additionally, most VF 
tests include a switching task in which words from two diferent categories are produced in an alternating order21.
Te relationship between VF and the various subdomains of EFs has frequently been investigated in both 
healthy controls19,22–24 and patients17,25. Concerning the relationship between VF and working memory, some 
studies showed that better working memory performance leads to less perseveration errors26 and a higher total 
score of produced words in the VF task22,27. However, a clear link between working memory and VF performance 
has so far not been found19,28. Similarly, the relationship between VF and response inhibition is not clear yet. 
While some studies report lower scores in VF concomitating with a decline of inhibition performance22 other 
studies failed to fnd a link between VF and inhibition20,29. Finally, regarding the relationship between VF and 
cognitive fexibility, studies report a positive correlation of switching between categories in VF tasks and cognitive 
fexibility performance21. However, there are also fndings which indicate that there is no relationship between 
EFs and VF performance30.
Altogether, results concerning the relationship of EFs and VF are ambiguous. Tis might, at least partly, be 
based on inter-individual variability of both EFs and VF. For example, a pronounced efect of age was identifed 
by multiple studies showing a signifcant negative correlation between age and the diferent aspects of EFs as 
well as VF performance31–34. Furthermore, fuid intelligence has been found to be related to the performance in 
EFs tasks tapping into the subdomains of planning and reasoning and35. In contrast, inhibition was shown to be 
independent of intelligence in children with problems performing attention tests36.
Te complex involvement of EFs in VF performance has also been shown to be modulated by the infuence 
of inter-individual variability like dynamically varying hormonal levels. Especially sex hormones like estradiol 
and progesterone have been shown to infuence performance in EFs tasks37,38. It was shown that cognitive performance varies during the diferent phases of the menstrual cycle with high progesterone and estradiol levels 
leading to faster reaction times and better accuracy37,39. Moreover, cortisol, which is mostly associated with stress, 
appears to impact EFs, but literature addressing this topic is ambiguous. On the one hand, studies found a positive relationship e.g. between cortisol level and working memory40 or cortisol level and performance in cognitive 
fexibility tasks41 in men. On the other hand an inverse relationship was found in cognitive fexibility tasks in 
women41 and in working memory performance42. Additionally to the infuence on EFs varying hormonal levels 
could be also linked to VF performance43. To investigate the role of varying hormonal levels studies implement 
diferent procedures: While some inject specifc hormones and assess the change of cognitive functions due to this 
injection44,45 other studies analyze intra-individual diferences measuring the naturally varying hormonal level 
at diferent points of time37,40. Test data of EFs and VF are commonly analyzed with classical statistical methods. 
For example, correlation analyses have been previously used to investigate the relationship of VF and specifc 
subdomains of EFs46. Other studies have investigated group diferences between patients and healthy controls to 
e.g. examine sex diferences in VF strategies19 or to explain the relationship of memory and VF in patients with 
Alzheimer’s disease28. Furthermore, factor analysis has also been applied to investigate common cognitive structures of VF performance24,30.
Considering previous literature investigating the relationship of EFs and VF in more detail it is obvious that 
each work contributes to a better understanding of this relationship but generalizing this knowledge is still 
difcult. Specifcally, these limitations are e.g. due to the small subject size or reduced EF test batteries which 
does not represent overall EF performance. Generalizability is also restricted due to the applied methods. All 
the above-mentioned methods are applied to investigate within-sample effects to understand the theoretical hypothesis-driven neuropsychological relationship between VF performance and EFs. However, it is so far 
unclear to what extend VF task performance refects the diferent subdomains of EFs. To address this question, 
more advanced statistical methods should lead to a more detailed insight into the complexity of VF performance. 
Machine learning models can be used to characterize complex behavior with the ultimate goal of identifying and 
predicting psychiatric diseases47,48. In contrast to classical statistical analyses, these prediction analyses use large 
sample sizes and a high number of variables as well as a cross-validation approach by training a model on part of 
the dataset and then validating it on unseen data. Applying machine learning methods on a wide variety of EF 
tests enables to capture the complex and non-linear relationship of EFs and VF performance.
To contribute to a deeper understanding of the so far inconclusive relationship between EFs and VF, the 
present study used a machine learning approach to investigate to what extent VF performance can be explained 
by subdomain-specifc EF tests. We hypothesize that VF performance can be explained by a conglomeration of 
cognitive fexibility, working memory and inhibition test scores, which is further modulated by individual variations of fuctuating hormone levels.
Methods
Participants. Te age of the 253 healthy participants was ranging from 20–55 years (mean age 35.3±11.0, 
99 males). Participants were monolingual German speakers and received diferent levels of education (fnished 
middle school: 10, professional school/job training: 70, fnished high school with a university-entrance diploma: 
76, university degree: 97). Participants were recruited in North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany) via social networks 
and the Forschungszentrum Jülich mailing list. Testing sessions took place at the Forschungszentrum Jülich, with

a duration of 150–180minutes depending on the time needed for instructions and the speed with which the participants passed the tests. A remuneration fee of €50 was paid.
Data collection. Data was collected by four diferent examiners, all of whom conducted several pilot testings 
and were instructed by the study leader to ensure a common standard. Te examiner gave standardized instructions before starting each test and help was provided by the examiner whenever the participant had any questions 
regarding the instructions or tests. Te testing session included 13 EF tests and 3 semantic VF tasks. Te EF test 
battery consisted of computerized versions of neuropsychological tests covering domains of inhibition, working 
memory and cognitive fexibility. Ten of these tests were taken from the Vienna Testsystem test battery and three 
were designed with PsyToolkit49. In this study, we assessed commonly used EF tests like the Stroop and TMT. We 
used a broad selection of EF tests to cover all subdomains of EFs and to detect most infuencing tests and their 
variables. A complete list of the tests is shown in Table 1.
Results of the neuropsychological tests can be seen in Table 2.
Te semantic VF tasks were based on the Regensburger Wortfüssigkeitstest50. Tis test is a standardized neuropsychological assessment that has been thoroughly tested for reliability, validity and objectivity50. Due to

language-specifc diferences in the frequency and usage of letters and categories51 this German version of VF task 
was used. Two of the tasks were simple semantic VF tasks in which the participant had to name animals (t1) and 
jobs (t2). Te third semantic VF task was a switching task in which the participant switched between fruits and 
sports (t3) within the same task. Each of the three tasks was performed for 2minutes. Te VF tasks were presented 
with Presentation sofware (Neurobehavioural Systems) and the participant’s responses were recorded automatically. Following the testing session, the recorded speech was transcribed and words were coded manually as being 
either correct answers or errors. Te number of correct words were counted for each task (t1, t2, t3) and the sum 
score of total number of correct words across all three VF tasks was used in all further analyses. To broadly represent VF performance, the sum of all VF tasks was selected to include diferent aspects of the task. Tis variety of 
VF performance is benefcial to build a machine learning model which is complex enough to refect the complex 
patterns of VF performance.
In addition to the main test set of EFs and VF tasks, phenotypical data was collected through questionnaires 
to gather information regarding the physical and psychological well-being of the participants. Tese questionnaires included the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) (Beck, Steer & Brown, 1996) which was used to collect 
information regarding depressive symptoms. Saliva samples were collected at the beginning and at the end of the 
test session. Te two saliva samples of each subject were sent to an external lab which pooled both samples before 
carrying out analysis for cortisol, progesterone, estradiol and testosterone. Additionally, the testing session also 
comprised further speech tests (word-picture interference task, picture description, spontaneous speech), for 
which results will not be reported here, as they will be independently analyzed. Tis additional data will then be 
described in a subsequent paper. Moreover, we aim to publish a data paper which will describe all aspects of data 
collection, test selection and testing procedure in detail while also making this data publicly available.
Collection and analyses of the data presented here was approved by the ethics committee of the Heinrich-Heine 
University Düsseldorf. We confrm that all experiments were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines 
and regulations. Moreover, informed consent was obtained from all participants.
Data analysis. Te original dataset of 253 participants was reduced to 235 due to missing data of some participants (94 males; 101 participants were aged between 20–31, 70 between 32–43, 64 between 44–55). From all 
EF tests 72 variables (Supplement 1) were extracted based on the features provided by the Vienna Testsystem and 
PsyToolkit49. VF performance was represented by the sum score of correct words across all VF tasks.
Two independent analyses were computed. In a frst analysis, Spearman correlations were computed to analyze the relationship of each EF variable and VF sum scores. Here, a reduction of the 70 EF variables was used. 
Specifcally, EF variables were selected based on the EF test manuals provided by the Vienna Testsystem in 10/13

EF tests. In cases where multiple main variables were provided by the Vienna Testsystem, the main variable was 
selected based on previous literature investigating EF performance. In contrast to the Vienna Testsystem, tests run 
within Psytoolkit are not standardized and thus do not come with associated test manuals. Tus, the selection of 
main variables of tests designed with Psytoolkit (3/13) were selected based on previous literature.
Considering the infuence of sex and age on the performance in EF and VF tasks19,22,34 data were adjusted for 
these variables by linear regression and analyses were computed with the residuals.
In a second analysis, the possibility of predicting VF from EF scores was investigated by applying supervised 
learning via a sparse (relevance vector machine; RVM) and non-sparse (partial least squares; PLS) model using 72 
EF variables (Supplement 1). Generally speaking, sparse models aim to reveal a sparse structure and detect correlations among redundant features52. Specifcally, RVM is based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) but is a 
Bayesian sparse technique which allows for the prediction of a specifc target value from a set of diferent features. 
In contrast, PLS is similar to principal components regression and is based on covariance. Results given in the 
Figure 1. Plots of signifcant correlations of executive function tests and total verbal fuency sum score. Te 
performance in verbal fuency task is represented by the total number of correct words produced across all 
three semantic VF tasks (t1+t2+t3).Te negative correlation in plot b-f are due to the divergent direction of the 
scores since these variables describe diferent types of errors, reaction or process times (the higher the worse the 
performance) while the performance in the verbal fuency is represented by the total amount of correct items 
(the higher the better).

main manuscript focus on the RVM approach, while results for the PLS analysis are given in the supplement. Sex 
and age were regressed out from VF score and from EF data in a cross-validation consistent way.
Before running the prediction analysis, data was transformed to z-scores. A 10-fold cross-validation was then 
performed for which the data set was randomly split into 10 sets, 9 of which were used for training while the 10th
set was held back and used to perform the prediction in previously unseen data. Ten replications of the 10-fold 
cross-validation were performed and thus 100 prediction models were computed. Prediction performance was 
assessed by computing the correlation between real and predicted values.
Beside testing statistical signifcance of prediction performance, we also examined which specifc EF features signifcantly impact prediction performance. To determine which EF features (EF test variables) contribute 
most strongly to the prediction, we employed an approximate permutation test procedure, in which associations 
between features (total set of EF variables) and labels (VF sum score of each participant) were randomized. Tat 
is, the VF performance score was randomly permuted while the feature matrix was kept unchanged. Te RVM 
analysis was repeated for each permutation and accuracies for 100 permutations were used to construct an empirical null distribution for each feature, which was used to compute the statistical signifcance of the contribution of 
each feature as the proportion of permutated labels achieving a better prediction than then original labels.
Results
Correlations between executive function scores and verbal fuency performance. Te correlation analyses identifed multiple signifcant results which are shown in Fig. 1.
Te highest negative correlation coefcient can be seen between the number of missed items in WAF-G
and the VF performance (r=−0.21; p=0.0009) indicating that a better performance in divided attention is 
associated with a higher VF score. Likewise, inhibition ability measured by the naming interference variable of 
the Stroop test (r=−0.20; p=0.001) shows a negative correlation with the VF score. Tis result indicates that 
participants who successfully inhibited proponent behavior in the Stroop task perform better in the VF task. 
Additionally, abstract reasoning assessed with the Raven’s Progressive Matrices test (SPM) reveals a positive correlation (r=0.19; p=0.003) to VF performance indicating a demand of cognitive fexibility and planning while 
generating words from a specifc category. Similar results were found for the TMT (r=−0.14; p=0.029) and the 
number of perseveration errors in the WCST (r=−0.14; p=0.032) which particularly refect the involvement of 
cognitive fexibility and working memory in the VF task. Additional to the EF battery we also found a signifcant 
negative correlation of the VF tasks and the Cortisol level of the subjects (r=−0.13; p=0.042).
Prediction of verbal fuency performance from EF scores. Te correlation of true and predicted values was r=0.28 (p<0.0001) (Fig. 2).
In order to quantify the contribution of the diferent EFs variables to VF performance, features with signifcant 
model weights in the approximate permutation test were identifed. As can be seen in Fig. 3, 8 features belonging 
to 4 diferent EF tests and 2 hormones were identifed.
Te EF feature with the highest impact on the prediction analysis is “mean reaction times” of unannounced 
items of the spatial attention test WAF-R. Te RVM analysis also revealed another “reaction time” feature of 
WAF-R which represents “reaction time” in items with a long stimulus onset asynchrony. Te infuence of attention on VF performance was also shown in a feature of WAF-G assessing the number of missed items in a divided 
attention test. Tese results show that participants reacting faster in attention tests also perform better in the VF 
task, identifying overall reaction speed and correctness as a central component in VF performance. Since WAF-R
is not only assessing attention but also includes inhibitory requirements, these results highlight the role of attention and inhibition during VF performance. Te explicit role of inhibition can be also detected in the variable 
“naming interference” of the Stroop test indicating that inhibition is an essential component to successfully produce words within or between two diferent categories. Te analysis also revealed the predictive meaningfulness 
of cognitive fexibility and planning, by showing that “non-perseveration errors” in WCST and “process time” in 
SPM contribute essentially to the prediction analysis. Te WAF-R was the only test presenting more than one variable represented in the most predictive features, both of which contain reaction time information. With regards 
to non-EF features, the RVM analysis also identifed stress hormone cortisol and sex hormone estradiol as highly 
predictive variables (Fig. 3).

Corresponding results of the PLS analysis revealed a correlation of true and predicted values of r = 0.35 
(p< 0.0001). However, in contrast to the results of the RVM analysis, approximate permutation test did not 
reveal any signifcant p-values identifying specifc EF features. Detailed results of the PLS analysis are given in the 
Supplementary Material (Supplement 2).
Discussion
Te aim of the study was to elucidate to what extent VF performance can be explained by diferent subdomains 
of EFs and which types of EF variables contribute most strongly to the prediction of VF performance. In a frst 
step, we correlated the diferent EF scores with the number of correctly produced words across the three semantic 
VF tasks. Tis analysis revealed signifcant correlations between SPM, Stroop, TMT, WCST, WAF-G, WAF-R
and the VF task performance. Tese EF tests tap into two EF domains, namely cognitive fexibility and inhibition. We further investigated the relationship of EF scores and VF by prediction analyses to gain insight into the 
contribution of the diferent EF test variables. We showed that EF data predict VF performance and that beside 
cognitive fexibility and inhibition, reaction time and attention play important roles in predicting VF performance. Additionally, hormonal infuences were identifed as meaningful parameters to predict VF performance, 
highlighting the infuence of inter-individual diferences in VF performance. We frst discuss the results in the 
direct context of the diferent EF subdomains cognitive fexibility, inhibition and working memory. Secondly, the 
involvement of EFs in the VF task is discussed in a more general context addressing the role of attention as well 
as the meaningfulness of reaction times. Finally, the infuence of varying hormonal levels illustrates the impact of 
inter-individual diferences on VF performance.
Multiple tests within the domain of cognitive fexibility were shown to be related to VF performance. Te 
highest correlation was found for the SPM test followed by TMT and WCST. While the correlation analysis 
revealed a relationship of these tests with VF performance, the prediction analysis confrms the importance of the 
features describing errors in WCST. Additionally, the prediction analysis highlights the component of processing 
speed during SPM which was not identifed by correlation analysis. In congruence with these results, previous 
studies have linked VF with cognitive fexibility21,53,54. Paula et al.
21 investigated this relationship in healthy adults, 
using simple and switching semantic VF tasks and three diferent EF tests, including the TMT. Tey found that 
this particular measure of cognitive fexibility correlated well with both simple and switching VF tasks. Te infuence of cognitive fexibility on VF was also examined in a study by Troyer et al.
54 who discussed the importance of 
cognitive fexibility assuming that two diferent abilities are needed for VF: (1) verbal memory for the creation of 
clusters and production of words belonging to a specifc subcategory; (2) strategic search and cognitive fexibility 
which enables shifing between clusters54.
It should be noted that the present results concerning the SPM might have to be treated with caution since 
this test also encompasses aspects of fuid intelligence55–57. Due to the relationship between EFs and fuid intelligence58,59, it may not surprise that fuid intelligence also impacts VF performance as has been shown in studies on 
schizophrenia60 and bipolar disorder patients61 as well as healthy controls60.
Altogether, considering that three out of fve cognitive fexibility tests contribute to VF performance, the present results point to a crucial infuence of cognitive fexibility on VF performance, especially to cluster words and 
switch between categories.
In addition to the domain of cognitive fexibility, inhibition tests were also identifed to play a role in VF performance. Specifcally, both the correlation analyses and prediction analysis revealed that the naming interference 
of the Stroop test is related to VF. Previous studies report ambiguous results when investigating the relationship between inhibition and speech production. For example, a positive correlation between inhibition, assessed 
with a stop-signal task, and the reaction time in picture naming46 was found but could not be validated in VF 
tasks23. Discussing these ambiguous results, the authors suggest that while stop-signal tasks measure the participant’s ability stopping a planned response (response inhibition), VF tasks tend to involve the ability of suppressing 
the activation of competitive target responses (selective inhibition). In the present study selective inhibition was 
assessed by the Stroop test. In the naming subtask of the Stroop test the participant is asked to name the color in 
which the word is printed. Incongruent items, in which the color of the word does not match the written word 
evoke a longer reaction time, indicating that prepotent responses (i.e. the meaning of the written word) have to 
be suppressed. Tis is very similar to the kind of inhibitions that participants are challenged with in the VF task 
when needing to suppress words which have already been produced. In accordance with previous literature24, the 
present suggests that selective inhibition, specifcally as refected in the naming interference of the Stroop test, is 
a key parameter to drive VF performance. An alternative interpretation of the naming interference of the Stroop
test and the total number of words produced in the VF task relates to the association between verbal processing 
speed and dominance of word reading. Individuals with a high verbal processing speed can be assumed to also 
show a stronger dominance of word reading then those with slower verbal processing. Tis stronger dominance 
of word reading, in turn, can be expected to go along with a stronger interference efect in the STROOP task, thus 
explaining the correlation between naming inference in the STROOP task and VF performance.
In addition to cognitive fexibility, working memory and inhibition we also investigated the role of attention 
in VF performance. While divided attention (WAF-G) was linked to VF performance in the correlation analysis, 
multiple variables of the spatial attention test (WAF-R) and divided attention test (WAF-G) contributed to VF 
performance in the prediction analysis.
Previous studies also described attention as a crucial cognitive function to perform VF54. In particular, it could 
be shown that divided attention particularly impacts the switching component of the VF tasks. At frst glance, 
the infuence of the spatial attention test on the speech task might be surprising since there are no spatial requirements in the VF task. Nevertheless, we assume that beside the component of attention per se the involvement of 
inhibition which is also part of this task might also have an efect on these results. With respect to the relationship

www.nature.com/scientificreports/ www.nature.com/scientificreports
of VF and divided attention, results are consistent with previous literature highlighting the infuence of divided 
attention especially in the VF switching task54. To sum up, attention might be a crucial aspect for performing VF 
task. In particular, we hypothesize that attention is a fundamental and permanent cognitive requirement during 
updating the current status of already produced words as well as being efcient in producing words within or 
between two.
Surprisingly, the present study did not fnd a relationship between working memory and VF performance in 
both the correlation and prediction analysis. However, previous studies investigating the involvement of working 
memory in VF tasks also report ambiguous results: For example, one study assessing a digit-span and spatial-span 
test did not fnd a signifcant relationship between working memory and VF28. However, other studies have 
reported results that indicate updating of information and working memory performance have a high impact on 
VF scores23,62,63. Additionally, another study found the relationship between memory performance and VF to be 
specifc to women19. Te missing link between working memory and VF in the current study might be the type 
of variable which was selected to represent VF performance. Here, the sum of correctly produced words was used 
as the main measure of VF performance. While measuring VF performance, this variable does not contain information about the types of errors that occur during the VF task. Although word repetitions (perseveration errors) 
did not count as correct produced words this error type is not analyzed separately. However, perseveration errors 
are described as a sensitive indicator of working memory performance. Additionally, the relationship between 
working memory and VF performance measured with the total sum of words has so far been mainly investigated 
in patients or older participants22,27 but rarely in healthy controls. Tus, we assume that the number of correct 
produced words might be less meaningful to refect working memory in healthy controls than error-specifc 
parameters like perseveration errors.
In general, prediction results reveal specifc EF tests and variables which are closely linked to VF performance. 
Besides diferences in the strength of the relationship between certain EFs and VF, the EF test constructs themselves might also have partially infuenced analysis. In particular, the reliability of some EF tests is discussed controversially64,65. Tus, some EF tests might not represent actual EF performance well and such a poor reliability of 
EF test might be refected in the relationship of EF to VF as studied here.
Comparing correlation and prediction analyses, crucial diferences in the results were observed. At frst 
glance, the EF tests identifed in the prediction analyses are similar to those of the correlation analyses but include 
additional variables. Specifcally, the prediction analyses reveal a number of additional variables that measure 
how fast participants completed the tests and how many errors they made. While there is limited literature about 
the infuence of processing speed in cognitive tasks on VF performance, some studies have addressed processing 
speed in general in the context of cognitive functions66,67. Another study found relationships between processing 
speed, working memory, inhibition and VF scores24. Additionally, poorer processing time has been associated 
with poorer cognitive performance in older adults66. Te association between processing speed and EFs has been 
also observed in patients with depression67. In line with these fndings, another study investigated the role of 
processing speed in schizophrenia patients and suggest that especially in working memory tasks assessing speed 
might be helpful to detect patterns of schizophrenia68. In respect to VF performance, processing speed was identifed as being closely related to speech production31 and is reported as a predictor for VF in ageing69. Based on 
previous literature and our present fndings, we assume that processing speed is a general aspect involved in both 
EFs tests and VF tasks. Particularly, it can be assumed that due to the time limit of 2minutes in the VF tasks participants are zealous to name as many words as possible. Tis general behavior might also be relevant in EF tests. 
Tus, we suggest that processing speed and reaction times indicate that people acting fast in cognitive tasks also 
perform more successfully in VF tasks than participants thinking more in detail about their answer. Additionally, 
we assume that the complex infuence of processing speed on VF performance might be beyond what can be 
described as a linear relationship. Tis might explain why the impact of speed is detectable in the prediction computation but was not found the correlation analysis.
In addition to the relationship between EFs and VF this study also assessed the infuence of hormonal fuctuations to investigate the infuence of inter-individual diferences. Te results showed that the stress hormone 
cortisol and the sex hormone estradiol have a high impact on VF performance. In line with other studies44,45 our 
analyses indicates that there is a negative correlation between cortisol level and the performance in cognitive 
functions. However, previous studies have also linked an increase of cortisol to better cognitive performance40,41. 
To our knowledge, rather little is known about the infuence of estradiol on VF performance. However, studies 
investigating the infuence of estradiol on EFs show that higher estradiol levels particularly leads to better performance in shifing and cognitive fexibility tasks37,39. Moreover, a link between hormonal contraceptives and 
VF performance43 has been shown. Tese results demonstrate that women taking hormonal contraception and 
consequently having signifcantly lower estradiol and progesterone levels, perform worse in the VF task than the 
control group43. Te high impact of cortisol and estradiol in the prediction analysis suggest that fuctuating hormones are essential parameters for predicting VF performance and that intra-individual diferences in hormone 
levels need to be considered when examining the relationship of cognitive functions and speech production tasks. 
Tus, it shows that although EF test variables are closely related to VF performance VF is a complex construct 
which is also driven by hormones and attention.
Our prediction analyses yielded important insights into the relationships between EFs, VF and inter-individual 
diferences. However, some open questions remain concerning both inter-individuality and speech related topics. 
Firstly, due to the fact that inter-individuality infuences both EFs and VF performance, further studies would 
beneft from gathering additional inter-individual parameters. For example, a test for assessing intelligence might 
be useful to control for the infuence of intelligence on each test, especially on the SPM, making it possible to 
better diferentiate the impact of cognitive fexibility on VF performance. Secondly, intra-individual diferences 
could be further investigated by gathering saliva samples at two diferent time points. In this study saliva samples of each participant were pooled. A comparison of the hormones level before and afer testing might help to

www.nature.com/scientificreports/ www.nature.com/scientificreports
provide insights into individual strategies dealing with stress. Beside inter-individual infuences of hormonal 
levels on EFs41, studies also report intra-individual variety e.g. due to diferent phases of the menstrual cycle38. 
Terefore, an analysis of hormonal levels within each participant taken at diferent time points could reveal an 
additional dimension representing intra-individual diferences.
Considering speech-specifc issues, a vocabulary test could contribute to better understand inter-individual 
diferences. Previous studies showed that the vocabulary size has a positive impact on VF performance54,70. 
Moreover, additional parameters refecting VF performance could help to gain deeper insights of searching strategies during VF tasks. In particular, semantic analyses provide details of clustering and switching24 and could 
indicate the participant’s strategies which could then be linked to EF performance.
A more general consideration is related to the predictive methods as used in this study. An independent data 
set assessing the same variables that were used in the study does not yet exist. Tus, it was not possible to validate 
our results in a totally independent dataset. Instead, we applied 10-fold cross-validation by repeatedly training 
the model on parts of the data while keeping a subset out as a validation sample. However, we are aware of the 
need to validate our results in an independent dataset to better generalize our results and suggest a replication of 
this study on an independent sample which could prevent study-specifc biases. However, due to the broad and 
specifc collection of the EF test battery fnding a similar data set could be difcult. An additional independent 
dataset with similar EF tests could be used to test split-half reliability investigating the construct of EF tests. Due 
to the high number of participants which is needed to apply machine learning methods it was not possible to split 
our data in two groups and running the prediction analysis on the split data. Te ambiguous results of the RVM 
and PLS analysis also need to be considered. While both approaches revealed a signifcant correlation between 
true and predicted values, the PLS approach did not identify any signifcant features (Supplement 2). Tis might 
be due to the fact that PLS is a non-sparse machine learning method, which will include all features in the prediction model. In contrast, it is the nature of sparse models like RVM to build the prediction model based on most 
relevant features only.
Due to the high number of participants and the large battery of EF tests this study provides a detailed view on 
the involvement of EFs in VF tasks and examines the infuence of fuctuating hormones. It investigated to what 
extent EF tests can represent semantic VF performance and shows that cognitive fexibility and inhibition are the 
main domains involved in performance on the VF task. Additionally, attention seems to be a central component 
of the VF task. Te most striking observation to emerge from the data analysis was the new and more detailed 
view of the EF tests and variables that are best at predicting VF performance. While correlation analyses provided 
frst insights into the relationship of EFs and VF, the prediction analyses revealed the importance of speed parameters. In particular, our results suggest that beside the infuence of specifc EFs, more general components such as 
attention and speed are crucial aspects of successful VF performance. Tese results also highlight the advantage 
of the prediction analysis since it revealed concrete variables of EF tests which also represents cognitive abilities 
not directly linked to specifc EF subdomains or representing standard variables.
A better understanding of the cognitive demands that are required for the successful performance of VF tasks 
can potentially lead to a more wide-spread use of VF tests in the clinical context, thus EF tests that tend to be 
time-consuming and inaccurate. Additionally, VF tests tend to better refect real-life conditions than lab-based EF 
batteries. A detailed knowledge of meaningful test variables could later on lead to insights into which subdomains 
of EFs could be replaced by VF tasks and which subdomains of EFs still have to be assessed by additional EF tests. 
Tis link between EF and VF represents a frst step towards a speech-based EF-test. Furthermore, it indicates that 
in investigating the relationship of EF and VF the complex construct of VF performance should be considered in 
research and clinical context.
Furthermore, taking the infuence of varying hormonal levels into account our study suggests that beside 
inter-individual diferences intra-individual fuctuations could play an important role in evaluating VF performance in clinical context.
