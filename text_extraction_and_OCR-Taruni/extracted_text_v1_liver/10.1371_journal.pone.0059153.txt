Abstract
Objective: In spite of the growing recognition of the specific association of waist circumference (WC) with type 2 diabetes
(T2D) and insulin resistance (IR), current guidelines still use body mass index (BMI) as a tool of choice. Our objective was to
determine whether WC is a better T2D predictor than BMI in family-based settings.
Research Design and Methods: Using prospectively collected data on 808 individuals from 42 extended Mexican American
families representing 7617.92 person-years follow-up, we examined the performance of WC and BMI as predictors of
cumulative and incident risk of T2D. We used robust statistical methods that accounted for the kinships and included
polygenic models, discrete trait modeling, Akaike information criterion, odds ratio (OR), relative risk (RR) and KullbackLeibler R2
. SOLAR software was used to conduct all the data analyses.
Results: We found that in multivariate polygenic models, WC was an independent predictor of cumulative (OR = 2.76,
p = 0.0002) and future risk of T2D (RR = 2.15, p = 3.5661029
) and outperformed BMI when compared in a head-to-head
fashion. High WC ($94.65 cm after adjusting for age and sex) was also associated with high fasting glucose, insulin and
triglyceride levels and low high-density lipoprotein levels indicating a potential association with IR. Moreover, WC was
specifically and significantly associated with insulin resistant T2D (OR = 4.83, p = 1.01610213).
Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the value of using WC as a screening tool of choice for future risk of T2D in Mexican
American families. Also, WC is specifically associated with insulin resistant T2D.

Introduction
The prevalence of Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is rapidly increasing
worldwide.1–3] This upsurge is concomitant with the sudden
global increase in the prevalence of obesity, an established risk
factor in the pathogenesis of T2D.4–7] This concomitance
indicates that the operationally easy-to-measure and accurate
anthropometric indexes that characterize obesity may also closely
associate with the risk of T2D and may therefore be used for the
screening of T2D. Such a public health intervention can be
expected to augment the programmatic yield of T2D detection
strategies and provide more opportunities for effective prevention
and control of T2D. Indeed, current guidelines by various agencies
like the WHO, ADA and German Diabetes Society (Deutsche
Diabetes Gesellschaft, DDG) recommend body mass index (BMI)
as the primary screening anthropometric index for T2D.8]
There is now a growing recognition that central rather than
general obesity is more contributory to and therefore better
correlates with the risk of T2D.9–13] Interestingly, BMI is an
indicator of generalized obesity while waist circumference (WC)
shows an excellent correlation with central obesity.13,14] Thus,
WC should be theoretically more useful than BMI to predict the
risk of T2D. In this context, we 15] and others have demonstrated
the superiority of WC over BMI for screening of T2D in
epidemiological settings.16–19] Such a paradigmatic shift from the
use of BMI to WC for screening of T2D entails that the screening
efficacy of WC should also be demonstrated in other settings such
as family studies. This is important since WC has been shown to
be a highly heritable trait 20–22]. In this regard, Gao et al. 23]
have recently shown that using WC as a monitoring tool for T2D
may be beneficial in family settings. Additional studies are

required that robustly demonstrate the screening performance of
WC in family studies across the world. Further, the relative
importance of BMI and WC in screening for T2D risk in the
families is unknown.
We conducted this study with the following research questions:
1) Is WC associated with an increased risk of current or future
T2D and its related traits in pedigreed Mexican American
individuals; and 2) Is WC better than BMI for predicting T2D
risk? To answer these two questions, we used the rich resource of
Mexican American subjects enrolled in the San Antonio Family
Heart Study (SAFHS) and examined the absolute and relative
performance of WC for the prediction of T2D in family settings.
Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
Informed written consent was obtained from all participants
before collection of samples. The Institutional Review Board of the
University of Texas Health Sciences Center at San Antonio
approved the study.
Study subjects
The SAFHS is an ongoing endeavor that focuses on 1,431
members of 42 large and extended Mexican American families in
San Antonio. Details of this study have been described elsewhere.24,25] Briefly, this collaborative research effort involving the
Texas Biomedical Research Institute and the University of Texas
Health Science Center at San Antonio began in 1991 and currently
includes data on ,2000 individuals. The SAFHS aims to quantify
the relative contributions of genetic and environmental factors to
the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases and metabolic
syndrome. Extensive phenotypic assessment for a number of traits
related to metabolic syndrome has been performed in these
individuals. As a part of this study, the participants were also
followed up prospectively. Currently data for the baseline and two
follow-up visits is available. We used this prospectively collected
data for the longitudinal component of this study.
Outcomes and predictors
We studied three primary outcomes: cumulative risk of T2D,
risk of incident T2D and risk of future insulin resistance (IR).
Cumulative risk of T2D was defined as concurrent existence or
future development of T2D. T2D was diagnosed according to
American Diabetes Association criteria.26] Participants who
reported to be under treatment with either oral anti-diabetic
agents or insulin, or who gave a history of diabetes were also
considered to have T2D. Incident T2D was defined as detection of
new cases of T2D during follow-up. IR was measured by the
Homeostasis Model of Assessment–Insulin Resistance (HOMAIR). The HOMA-IR was estimated as follows – fasting glucose
(mmol/L) x fasting insulin (mU/ml)/22.5.27] For defining IR we
used HOMA-IR cut-points of 2.6 (the commonly used clinical cutpoint for IR) and 3.8 (as specifically recommended for MexicanAmerican populations).28] We also examined associations with
several T2D-related traits as secondary outcomes. These included
fasting glucose, fasting glucose adjusted for anti-diabetic drug use,
serum insulin, triglycerides, total serum cholesterol, high density
lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), directly measured low density
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), LDL-C fraction 1 and LDL-C
fraction 2. Blood samples were obtained after a 12-hour fast for
measurement of various phenotypes including glucose, total
cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL and HDL cholesterol, and they
were collected again 2 h after a standardized oral glucose load to
measure plasma glucose. All the secondary outcomes and insulin
resistance were assessed prospectively at the second follow-up visit.
We examined the association of the following 15 anthropometric indexes with one or more of the aforementioned outcomes. The
anthropometric indexes included skin-fold thicknesses (biceps,
triceps, forearm, subscapular, abdominal, suprailiac, medial calf
and lateral calf), waist and hip circumferences, weight, height and
three composite indexes: BMI, waist/hip ratio (WHR) and
subscapular/triceps ratio (STR). Methods for measurements of
these indexes have been described previously.22,25]
Statistical analysis
We used univariate and multivariate polygenic models to study the
association of various anthropometric indexes with cumulative risk of
T2D. All the polygenic models used in this study were of the form:
Oi~mzXbkaikzgizei
where, O is the outcome of interest; m is the trait mean; a is the
covariate vector of dimension k with b as the corresponding
regression coefficients; g is the polygenic effect and e is the residual
error for an individual indexed by i. In all of these models we
included age, age2
, age*sex, age2*sex and sex as covariates. For
univariate analyses the polygenic models included the abovementioned covariates and each anthropometric index separately.
Model fits were compared using log-likelihoods (for all outcomes)
and the Kullback-Leibler R2 (K-L R2
, for dichotomous outcomes
only). For multivariate analyses, all the anthropometric indexes
were simultaneously included in a single model along with the
abovementioned covariates. However, since WHR is highly
correlated with WC by definition, we could not use a single
multivariate model including all the composite indexes (BMI, WHR
and STR) as covariates. Instead, we ran univariate polygenic models
for each of these indexes and then compared the model fits using KL R2
. For comparing regression coefficients of different indexes, we
estimated the standardized regression coefficient for each index as
the regression coefficient divided by its standard error.
Statistical significance of the regression coefficient estimated
from a polygenic model was determined by constraining the
regression coefficient to zero, estimating the difference in loglikelihoods between the constrained and unconstrained models
and applying a chi-square test. For dichotomous outcomes, the
discrete trait modeling procedure was used. The odds ratio (OR) of
a dichotomous outcome was determined as e{ ffiffi
p p b since the
SOLAR software 29] returns a negative regression coefficient from
a probit model for a positively associated covariate.
For ease of clinical usage, we estimated the optimal cut-point for
WC as a predictor of the cumulative risk of T2D. We
dichotomized WC by sliding cut-points over the observed range.
At each cut-point we used age and sex adjusted polygenic models
with the dichotomized WC as a covariate. From each model we
determined the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) [estimated as -
26Loglikelihood – 2*(number of fitted parameters)] and the OR.
The optimal cut-point was estimated as that at which the AIC was
minimum and OR was maximum. SOLAR software was
employed in all the statistical analyses and statistical significance
was assessed at a type I error rate of 0.05.

Study subjects
We studied 808 participants from 42 extended Mexican American
families on whom data for various metabolic, anthropometric and

demographic variables was available. One hundred and seventy
eight (22.02%) subjects developed T2D by visit 3 of whom 100
subjects were detected as new diabetes cases during follow-up. The
total length of follow-up was 7617.92 person-years, translating to an
incidence rate of 13.13 T2D cases/1000 population/year. The
mean age of the study sample was 37.0 (SD = 14.39) years and there
were 292 (36.1%) males. Prevalence of insulin resistance was 74.6%
based on a HOMA-IR cut-off of 2.6 and 56.1% using a cut-off of
3.8.
Anthropometric indexes and cumulative risk of T2D
We first studied the associations of various anthropometric
indexes like skin-fold thicknesses (biceps, triceps, forearm,
subscapular, abdominal, suprailiac, medial calf and lateral calf),
waist and hip circumferences, and weight and height with the
cumulative risk of T2D (Table 1). We used univariate and
multivariate polygenic regression models adjusting for age, sex and
their interaction to evaluate these associations. In univariate
polygenic analyses, all the anthropometric indexes except lateral
calf thickness and height were independently and significantly
associated with the cumulative risk of T2D (Table 1). Interestingly,
WC showed the strongest association with the cumulative risk of
T2D (b= 20.4761, p = 4.30610214). In the multivariate polygenic model (i.e. including all the anthropometric indexes in the single
model), we observed that only biceps skinfold thickness, lateral calf
skinfold thickness and WC were significantly associated with the
cumulative risk of T2D (Table 1). Notably, the strength of
association of WC with cumulative risk of T2D increased in the
multivariate context as compared to that in the univariate context
(b = 20.5746 and 20.4761; OR = 2.76 and 2.32 for multivariate
and univariate models, respectively).
WC as a predictor of future T2D
As WC was strongly associated with the cumulative risk of T2D,
we next assessed whether WC can also predict the future risk of
T2D. For this we studied the association of WC with the incident
cases of T2D (new cases during follow-up) using the polygenic
model. Indeed, WC was also significantly associated with an
increased risk of incident T2D [b= 20.43, RR (95% CI) = 2.15
(1.64–2.82) p = 3.5661029
]. Thus WC was not only associated
with the cumulative risk of T2D but also predicted the future risk
of T2D.
Comparison of WC with composite anthropometric
indexes
Subsequently, we compared the performance of WC with other
composite anthropometric indexes like BMI, WHR and STR for
predicting the cumulative risk of T2D using univariate polygenic
models. We observed that the K-L R2 values for WC, BMI, WHR
and STR were 0.20, 0.18, 0.19 and 0.13, respectively. The
standardized regression coefficients (p) for these indexes were
27.1034 (4.20610214), 26.3093 (2.44610211), 26.5005
(9.17610213) and 22.2081 (0.0456), respectively. Importantly,
WC was strongly correlated with the cumulative T2D risk.
However, the heritability of WC was marginally lower than that of
BMI (0.54 versus 0.56).
To address our second research question, we further compared
the associative performance of WC and BMI in a head-to-head
fashion. In a multivariate polygenic model we included both WC
and BMI as correlates of cumulative T2D risk. To ensure that
these analyses were not influenced by potential collinearity
between WC and BMI, we first estimated the total phenotypic
correlation between these two traits. For this reason, we used
bivariate trait analyses in which the kinship structure, age, sex and
their interactions were accounted for. We found that 23.29% of
the model variance was unique and not accounted for by the
phenotypic correlation between WC and BMI, thus mitigating the
possible influence of collinearity on our results. We estimated from
the polygenic model that WC (standardized b = 23.67,
p = 0.0002) was a more powerful predictor of cumulative T2D
risk than BMI (standardized b = 20.09, p = 0.9269). Moreover,
when we compared the performance of WC and BMI for
predicting the future risk of T2D in a multivariate polygenic
model, we observed that WC [standardized b= 27.29, RR (95%
CI) = 2.12 (1.65–2.71) p = 0.0066] was a better and stronger
predictor of incident T2D than BMI [standardized b = 20.41, RR
(95% CI) = 1.05 (0.84–1.32) p = 0.8480].
Determination of the optimal cut-point for WC
We aimed to find an age- and sex-adjusted cut-point that can
simply yet informatively dichotomize WC as a correlate of the
cumulative T2D risk. The best cut-point (as indicated by the
minimum AIC of 669.05) in this population was 94.65 cm
(Figure 1). At this cut-point the OR (95% CI) for cumulative
T2D risk was 4.53 (2.98–6.87). Interestingly, another peak in OR
was observed at a WC cut-point of 118.5 cm. While this peak
could be construed as representing a cut-point for males, we found
that the AIC at this cut-off was quite high (698.55) as compared to
that for the gender-nonspecific cut-point of 94.65 cm.
Arguably, use of a gender-agnostic cut-point may lose diagnostic
information as compared to the strategy of using a gender-specific
cut-point. To directly contrast these two strategies, we compared
the predictive performance of the gender-agnostic cut-point with
that of the recommended gender-specific WC cut-points for the
US population ($102cm for males and $88 cm for females).30]
We found that the strategy of using a single cut-point demonstrated predictive performance comparable to the strategy of using
the gender-specific cut-points (AIC of 669.05 versus 658.25, that is
an information loss of 1.6% due to gender-agnostic cut-point).
Moreover, the OR for T2D risk associated with the single cutpoint strategy (4.53) was better than that associated with the
strategy of gender-specific cut-points (3.98).
Association of dichotomized WC with T2D-related traits
We observed that dichotomized WC was significantly associated
with high fasting glucose (b = 0.5251, p = 3.81610214), fasting
glucose adjusted for anti-diabetic drug use (b= 0.3659,
p = 2.6461028
), high serum insulin (b= 0.6025,
p = 5.44610211), high triglycerides (b = 0.3422, p = 2.3861025
)
and low HDL-C (b= 20.3142, p = 0.0001) (Figure 2). Only 1.8%
of study subjects were receiving lipid-lowering drugs, and
adjustment for the use of these drugs did not alter the results
significantly (Table S1).
Association of dichotomized WC with IR and insulin
resistant T2D
The abovementioned associations are interesting because high
fasting glucose, high serum insulin, high triglycerides and low
HDL-C are all indicators of insulin resistance.31,32] Therefore,
we next assessed whether dichotomized WC is associated with IR
in general and insulin resistant T2D (defined as presence of IR as
well as T2D) in particular. We observed that dichotomized WC
was highly predictive of both IR and insulin resistant T2D
(Figure 3). Interestingly, dichotomized WC strongly predicted
T2D with HOMA-IR .3.8 [b = 20.8902, OR (95% CI) = 4.83
(3.12–7.49), p = 1.01610213, Figure3].

The definition of HOMA-IR used in our study did not consider
the concurrent use of anti-diabetic agents. To safeguard against
the potential confounding due to this, we repeated the abovementioned analyses by adjusting for the use of anti-diabetic drugs.
Our results still concurred with earlier interpretations (compare
the purple and red bars in Figure 3).
Discussion
Our results clearly demonstrate that WC is the strongest
anthropometric index that associates with insulin resistance and
T2D in Mexican American families whether examined longitudinally or cumulatively. Irrespective of age and gender, WC
exceeding 94.65 cm was most informative with regard to a
cumulative risk of T2D. Of note, in univariate or multivariate
contexts, WC was more strongly related to cumulative or incident
risk of T2D as compared to BMI. The implications of our results
need to be considered in the light of three important aspects of
research related to metabolic syndrome and T2D.
First, there is an ongoing debate on the use of WC or BMI in
screening programs for early detection of T2D.8,33] Various
clinical guidelines primarily favor the use of BMI in screening
programs, while a recent meta-analysis 33] indicates that BMI and

WC can be used interchangeably since they have similar
predicting abilities for future risk of T2D. On the other hand,
there is now a growing recognition that WC may be more suited
than BMI as a predictor of T2D risk.34] Studies in various
populations 15,18,35] have demonstrated the superiority of WC
over BMI in this regard. Our findings support the view that WC
should be used in screening programs instead of BMI because 1)
WC is strongly associated with the risk of both prevalent and
incident T2D; 2) WC is also an indicator of insulin resistance
(irrespective of the presence of T2D) and insulin resistant T2D (i.e.
insulin resistance with the presence of T2D); 3) In a single
multivariate model WC outperformed BMI as a predictor of
cumulative as well as incident risk of T2D; and 4) In spite of its
high heritability WC still independently predicted the risk of T2D

in pedigreed Mexican American families. Moreover, WC is as
simple, convenient, inexpensive and easy to use in clinical practice
as BMI and it can be easily monitored by patients themselves. For
these reasons we believe that reevaluation of existing guidelines for
screening of T2D is needed.
Second, the role of WC for prediction of T2D risk in families
has been understudied. To our knowledge, a prospective
evaluation of the importance of WC in diabetes pathogenesis in
extended pedigrees has not been studied. Our results therefore
proffer novel evidence in that regard. Since use of families as units
can improve outcomes of diabetes screening programs,36] our
findings point towards the possibility of further refining such
strategies by inclusion of WC as the primary screen. WC is one of
the requirements for the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome and the
International Diabetes Federation (IDF) recommends that WC
cut-points specific for different populations are needed.30] Our
results demonstrate that an age-, sex-adjusted cut-point of
94.65 cm was highly informative in this ethnic population. While
the generalizability of this cut-point remains limited, it is
noteworthy that the optimal WC cut-point observed in this study
for the prediction of T2D risk is practically close to the average of
the recommended gender specific cut-points (102 cm for males
and 88 cm for females) for the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome.30] This would therefore indicate that the recommended
WC cut-point for the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome might also
be useful for predicting the future risk of T2D. Further, our results
suggest that use of a single population-specific WC cut-point may
be at least as informative as gender-specific cut-points.
Third, we found that WC was specifically associated with future
risk of insulin resistance as well as insulin resistant T2D. WC is
associated with IR since it closely associates with visceral obesity,
which is a critical determinant of IR. Indeed, WC in itself is
considered to be a strong predictor of visceral fat.12] Mechanistically, increased secretion of free fatty acids and inflammatory
cytokines combined with decreased secretion of adiponectin
orchestrate in the multivariate culmination in visceral obesity
and insulin resistance.37] At the level of the adipocyte, hyperinsulinaemia characteristic of IR activates 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in the omental adipose tissue and is followed by release
of active cortisol. These changes induce a cushingoid fat
distribution and increase in WC.38] Our observations afford a
strong support to these biological underpinnings. Recent past has
seen an accretion of epidemiological evidence that bolsters the
associative/causal link between WC and IR. However, prospective
family-based studies that show such a link have generally been
lacking.
The clear strengths of our approach are a family-based
prospective study design, an ethnically homogenous sample, a
large sample size, extensive follow-up data and robust statistical
methods. However, our study suffers from limitations inherent in
any observational study of this type. First, the attrition rate in the
present study was 33.1%, which is slightly higher than that seen in
typical prospective studies. Since information on metabolic
syndrome related traits was not available for the individuals who
did not complete the follow up, it was not possible to predict the
direction of effect of this potential attrition bias on the strength of
tested associations. However, assuming that the attrition pattern
was missing-at-random, we believe that the attrition would only
under-power our interpretations and not bias them either-way.
Second, due to the nature of the periodically scheduled visits, the
exact time of event (i.e. the date of T2D occurrence) in the study
participants is unknown. Instead, we used the cumulative risk of
T2D as our primary outcome. This outcome variable captures the
existing and prospective risk of T2D development. Lastly, our
study sample represents a high risk population for metabolic
syndrome and therefore these results cannot be directly applied to
the general population.
Notwithstanding these limitations, our results provide compelling support to the burgeoning notion that WC is a simple and
accurate predictor of ensuing and impending T2D especially if IR
is concomitantly present. These results further highlight a need for
reexamination, reappraisal and revision of existing guidelines with
an aim to improve assessment of T2D risk.
