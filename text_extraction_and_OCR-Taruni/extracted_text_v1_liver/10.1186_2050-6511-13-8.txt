Low rates of hepatotoxicity among Asian patients
with paracetamol overdose: a review of 1024 cases
Abd-Rahman Marzilawati1,2, Yen-Yew Ngau2 and Sanjiv Mahadeva1*
Abstract
Background: The metabolism of paracetamol in Asians is thought to differ from Westerners. Detailed clinical
features of paracetamol -induced hepatotoxicity among Asians remains largely unreported.
Methods: A retrospective review of adult cases with paracetamol overdose over a five-year duration was performed
in two of the largest public institutions in this country. Prevalence and predictive factors for hepatotoxicity were
determined.
Results: Data on 1024 patients (median age 23 years, 82.0% female, ethnic groups: Malays 40.8%, Chinese 20.9% ,
Indian 33.2%) were obtained from January 2005 to December 2009. The median amount of paracetamol ingestion
was 10.0 (IQR 5.0 - 15.0) g and the median serum paracetamol level was 274.80 (IQR 70.0 - 640.0) μmol/L at
presentation. 75 (7.3%) patients developed hepatotoxicity. 23/ 55 (41.8%) patients who had ingested > 10 g of
paracetamol and had a delayed (> 24 hour) administration of N-acetyl cystine (NAC) developed hepatotoxicity. No
patients developed acute liver failure nor suffered any mortality (0%). Independent predictors for hepatotoxicity
were identified as Malay (OR 2.22, 95% CI = 1.13-4.37) and Chinese (OR 3.26, 95% CI = 1.55-6.84) ethnicity,
paracetamol dose > 10 g (OR 2.61, 95% CI = 1.53-4.46), prolonged duration of time from paracetamol ingestion to
hospital presentation (> 24 hours OR 10.71, 95% CI = 3.46-33.15) and prolonged duration of time from paracetamol
ingestion to NAC administration (> 24 hours OR 9.02, 95% CI = 2.97-27.45).
Conclusions: Paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity rates in a multi-ethnic Asian population was low at 7.3%.
Mortality and morbidity were non-existent despite high doses of paracetamol ingestion and delayed presentations
to hospital.

Background
Paracetamol, or acetaminophen, overdose is a common
means of self-poisoning worldwide due its wide availability and accessibility. It has been reported as the most
common drug overdose either accidentally or unintentionally in the United Kingdom (UK), Europe, United
States (US), and Australasia [1-3]. Paracetamol overdose
is recognised to cause a range of hepatic damage from
mild to severe hepatotoxicity, leading to acute liver failure (ALF) and death, despite the availability of antidote
therapy. ALF resulting from paracetamol overdose has
been extensively reported in the UK, US, France, Canada
and Australia [4,5]. ALF due to paracetamol overdose
has been reported to be most common in the U.K. (60-
75% of ALF aetiology), but less frequent in the U.S. (approximately 20% of ALF aetiology) and even lower in
certain parts of Europe (2% of ALF aetiology in France)
[4,6]. However, in recent years, the incidence of paracetamol-induced ALF cases in the US has increased exponentially [7].
In a recent review article on the differences in aetiopathogenesis of ALF between Western and Eastern
populations, it was reported that viral hepatitis remained
the commonest cause of ALF in Asians. Paracetamol
overdose resulting in ALF was believed to be infrequent
in Asia due to differences in healthcare cultural practices
and lack of availability of over-the-counter drugs [8].
Whilst the latter fact may be true in lesser developed
countries, many rapidly developing Asian nations have a

wide availability of over-the-counter drugs and cultural
practices which are similar to the West. To date, two
reports from small sample-sized studies in Hong Kong
and Penang, Malaysia, have only demonstrated low rates
of paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity ranging from 2 -
6% [9,10]. Details on predictive factors for paracetamolinduced hepatotoxicity among Asians remain uncertain.
This study aimed to examine the prevalence of hepatotoxicity in a large sample of adults with paracetamol
overdose in a multi-ethnic Asian population, and determine predictive factors for hepatotoxicity in these
patients.
Methods
Study design and data collection
Approval from the University Malaya Medical Centre
(UMMC) ethics committee was obtained prior to the
conduct of this study. In Malaysia, the majority of our
urban population is concentrated in the capital, Kuala
Lumpur. The UMMC, a 900-bedded hospital and the
General Hospital of Kuala Lumpur (GHKL), a 1000-
bedded institution, are the two oldest and largest public
institutions in the city. Both UMMC and GHKL have an
estimated 110, 000 and 150,000 admissions to their
Emergency Departments on an annual basis respectively
(local institutional statistics 2008, unpublished). A retrospective review of clinical records was performed in both
these centres for a five-year duration from 2005 to 2009.
The International Classification and Diagnosis (ICD) 9
and 10 coding systems were used to identify individuals
with paracetamol overdose from the Medical Records
units of both institutions. All patients aged ≥ 18 years of
age who had a diagnosis of paracetamol overdose from
ICD 9 and 10 coding system were included.
Information obtained from the medical records
included the following: basic demography, timings of
paracetamol overdose, presentation to Emergency
Departments and administration of N-Acetylcysteine
(NAC), estimated doses of paracetamol ingested based
on patient’s recall, concomitant ingestion of other drugs,
alcohol, history of psychiatric disorders and numbers of
overdose attempts. All blood investigations during this
period were available in both institutions' computerised
laboratory database and the following data were collected: serum paracetamol level, liver function tests, pH,
coagulation profile and renal profile. The main outcomes
in terms of duration of hospital stay and survival (i.e.
discharged or died in hospital) were also available from
both institutions' computerised data system.
Definitions
Hepatotoxicity was defined by a peak serum alanine
transaminase (ALT) level > 1000 IU/L, in accordance
with previous accepted nomenclature in the literature
[11]. ALF was defined as the presence of coagulopathy
(INR > 1.5) together with hepatic encephalopathy within
8–26 weeks of onset of symptoms in a patient without
any prior liver disease [12].
Statistics
All results were analysed using the Statistical Package
for Social Scientists (SPSS version 19.0, USA). Continuous variables were expressed as means with a standard
deviation or medians where appropriate. Categorical
data were expressed as proportions. Continuous data
were analysed using Student’s t-test, Mann–Whitney –U
test and Kruskal Wallis test where appropriate. Categorical data were analysed with chi-square test or Fischer’s
exact test where appropriate. Significant associations
with hepatotoxicity identified at univariate analysis were
subsequently analysed in a multivariate analysis to identify independent predictors of hepatotoxicity. Predictive
factors were expressed as odds ratios with a 95% confidence interval. Statistical significance was defined as a p
value of <0.05.
Results
Between January 2005 to December 2009, a total of 1,410
cases were identified as paracetamol overdose according
to ICD 9 or ICD 10 coding systems in both UMMC and
HKL. 386 cases were excluded due to a combination of
missing medical records, coding misclassification and
age < 18 years. 1024 cases of medical records were finally
available for analysis. The incidence of paracetamol
overdoses from January 2005 to December 2009 in
UMMC and KLGH are highlighted in Figure 1. In general, there had been an increase in incidence in both
institutions from 2005 to 2006, with a steady rate of
paracetamol overdose cases in the last 4 years. More
cases of paracetamol overdose had been admitted to
UMMC (n = 583) compared to KLGH (n = 441) during
the period of study.
Clinical characteristics of paracetamol overdose patients
Demographic and clinical data of the study population
are highlighted in Table 1. The median age of adults
with paracetamol overdose was 23 years, 840 (82.0%)
patients were female and the major ethnic group consisted of Malays (n = 418, 40.8%). Paracetamol overdose
resulted from deliberate self-harm in 885 (81.7%) cases,
unintentional overdose in 198 (18.3%) cases and alcohol
co-ingestion was not common (n = 46, 4.2%). The clinical presentation of patients with paracetamol poisoning
consisted mainly of gastrointestinal tract symptoms. 859
(79.3%) of patients received NAC for their paracetamol
overdose.

Clinical details of paracetamol overdose
The median amount of paracetamol ingestion in 1024
patients was 10.0 (IQR 5.0 - 15.0) g and the median
serum paracetamol level was 274.80 (IQR 70.0 - 640.0)
μmol/L at presentation. The median duration from paracetamol ingestion to hospital presentation was 4.5 (IQR
2.3 - 11.5) hours. There was a median duration of 6.50
(IQR 2.5 - 14.0) hours from timing of paracetamol ingestion to NAC administration, whilst timing from hospital
presentation to NAC administration was a median of 1.5
(IQR 0.0 to 4.1) hours, indicating that there was little
delay in the administration of NAC at presentation to the
emergency units in both hospitals. Most patients were
admitted for a median of 3 days, ranging from 2 – 4 days.
Hepatotoxicity rates and clinical outcome
75 (7.3%) patients with paracetamol overdose developed
hepatotoxicity, i.e. a peak serum ALT ≥ 1000 IU/L. 124
(12.1%) patients had a moderately raised peak serum
ALT (66–999 IU/L) whilst the remaining 825 (80.6%)
had normal liver function tests. 146 (14.3%) cases had an
INR ≥ 1.5 but none of the patients with hepatotoxicity
developed acute liver failure. 24/ 149 patients with mild
drowsiness or stupor at presentation had an INR > 1.5.
However, 10 of these patients had alcohol intoxication
and the remainder had co-ingestion or either benzodiazepines or antidepressants. All 1024 patients with paracetamol overdose were discharged well following
hospitalisation. 542 patients had ingested > 10 g of paracetamol, but only 61 (11.3%) developed hepatotoxicity.
Among these 542 cases, 23/ 55 (41.8%) patients who had
a delayed (> 24 hours) administration of NAC developed
hepatotoxicity.
Predictive factors for paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity
Potential risk factors for paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity were evaluated by univariate analysis (Table 2).
Demographically, no specific age nor gender groups
were found to have a risk of hepatotoxicity. However, a
significant association with hepatotoxicity was observed
with ethnicity (ethnic Indians 3.8% vs ethnic Malays
8.6% vs ethnic Chinese 12.1%). Clinically, a paracetamol
dose of > 10 g was associated with hepatotoxicity
(11.3% > 10 g vs 2.7% < 10 g, p < 0.001), together with a
prolonged duration of time from paracetamol ingestion
to hospital presentation (1.8% < 3.9 hours vs 8.6% 4–24
hours vs 32.4% > 24 hours) and duration of time from
paracetamol ingestion to NAC administration (1.9% < 3.9
hours vs 8.7% 4–24 hours vs 34.8% > 24 hours) (Table 2).

Independent predictors of paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity, explored by logistic regression analysis, were
found to include the following: Malay (OR 2.22, 95% CI =
1.13-4.37) and Chinese (OR 3.26, 95% CI = 1.55-6.84) ethnicity, paracetamol dose > 10 g (OR 2.61, 95% CI = 1.53-

CI = 1.60-7.43; > 24 hours OR 10.71, 95% CI = 3.46-33.15)
and prolonged duration of time from paracetamol ingestion to NAC administration (4–24 hours OR 2.94, 95%
CI = 1.07-8.00; > 24 hours OR 9.02, 95% CI = 2.97-27.45).
Discussion
This retrospective study represents one of the largest
case series of paracetamol overdoses that has been
reported to date. The duration of 5 years demonstrated
little variation in admission patterns (apart from the first
year) and there had been no major changes in the medical management of paracetamol overdose during this
period. As all cases of poisoning in this country are
solely managed in public institutions, the data from this
study is fairly representative of the population from the
largest city in this country. Furthermore, the general
Malaysian urban population consists of 3 major ethnic
groups, i.e. Malays, Chinese and Indians [13]. Hence,
our study has relevance to other populations in Asia as
well.
In this study, we have demonstrated that despite significant numbers of paracetamol overdose over a 5-year
duration, only 7.3% of this multi-ethnic Asian adult

population developed hepatotoxicity and no (i.e. n = 0)
patients developed ALF following paracetamol overdose.
Our results are in concurrence with previous reviews
that paracetamol overdose is a rare cause of ALF in
Asians. It is noteworthy that > 50% of patients who
ingested > 10 g of paracetamol and had a delayed
(> 24 hours after paracetamol ingestion) administration
of NAC did not develop hepatotoxicity. Whilst the usual
characteristics of paracetamol pharmacology such as cumulative dose and delayed timing of NAC administration predicted hepatotoxicity, this study identified that
ethnicity, particularly those of Malay (OR 2.22) and
Chinese (OR 3.26), were independent determinants of
hepatotoxicity. The latter fact may suggest, but does not
confirm, that ethnic differences in paracetamol metabolism may contribute towards paracetamol-induced
hepatotoxicity.
We have compared our case series with previous publications and summarised the salient features in Table 3.
Paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity rates, using a similar
definition as ours, in Western patients have been reported
to range from 15% to 36% [5,9,10,14-22]. The only exception was a study from Edinburgh, UK, which reported a
4% rate of hepatotoxicity among 987 patients with paracetamol overdose, but patients who presented > 15 hours
post paracetamol ingestion had been excluded [21]. Paracetamol overdose had a mortality rate of up to 7% despite
NAC administration, although mortality rates have
declined over time due to successful liver transplantation
in many centres. In contrast to Caucasian patients in
Western studies, two publications from Asia and a single
study from the Caribbean have reported hepatotoxicity
rates ranging from 2% to 7% [9,10,19]. Acute liver failure
was not a feature and no mortality had been reported in
the latter case series. The data from our large case series
of 1024 patients appears to mirror the findings from these
earlier smaller sample-sized studies.
A possible explanation for the lower hepatotoxicity
rates in non-Western studies may be explained by the
cumulative dose of paracetamol ingested by individuals.
The minimal amount of paracetamol known to cause
toxicity in adults is approximately 7.5 g and liver toxicity
is usually associated with paracetamol doses of > 10 g
[23]. In our study, we estimated that 52% of patients had
ingested > 10 g of paracetamol and the median dose in
our population was 10 g. In several of the studies that
have been reported from Western centres, the mean or
median doses of paracetamol ingested have been
reported to be higher, although not in all [17,21,22]. The
mean/ median doses of paracetamol ingested in studies
from the U.K., U.S. and Denmark have been reported as
15 g, 18 g and 25 g respectively (Table 3). However,
other studies on Caucasian populations with similar median paracetamol doses (to ours) still reported higher
hepatotoxicity rates of 14 - 31% (Table 3). An additional
point is that NAC administration in our patients was
based on normalised dosing. Asian patients may have inadvertently received higher NAC doses compared to
Western patients of a higher averaged body weight.
An alternative explanation for an increased paracetamolinduced hepatotoxicity among Western patients may be
related to alcohol co-ingestion. Chronic alcohol exposure is
recognised to increase short term toxicity from paracetamol
overdose by 2 to 3 fold increase in hepatic content of cytochrome P4502E1, the major isoform responsible for the
generation of the toxic metabolite from paracetamol [24].
About 25% of Western patients with paracetamol overdose
were documented to have a regular alcohol consumption
and excessive alcohol co-ingestion with paracetamol overdose was reported in 20-40% of cases [14,15,18]. In contrast, the rate of alcohol co-ingestion was only 4.2% in our
study and 10 - 17% in other Asian studies [10,19].
Variation in the timing of NAC administration may be
another explanation for differences in hepatotoxicity

rates between studies. Delayed administration of NAC to
patients with potentially toxic doses of paracetamol is a
recognised risk factor for hepatotoxicity, an observation
that was also demonstrated in our study. Patients with
paracetamol overdose who had received NAC > 24 hours
after paracetamol ingestion in our study were 10.4 times
more likely to develop hepatotoxicity compared to those
who received NAC earlier. Among our study cases, 92%
of patients received NAC within 24 hours. Unfortunately, data on the timing of NAC administration has
not been reported widely in the literature, and further
comparisons have not been possible. However, it is notable that despite 80% of patients receiving NAC within
24 hours of paracetamol overdose a 14% hepatotoxicity
rate (i.e. double the rate in our study) was reported in a
recent Australian study [5].
Pharmacogenetic variation in the metabolism of paracetamol between Caucasians and Orientals has previously been studied [25]. In a study comparing urinary
excretion of paracetamol metabolites in 125 Caucasians
and 33 ethnic Chinese, heterogeneity in the conversion
of paracetamol cysteine conjugates (toxic paracetamol
metabolites) to mercapturate via N-acetylation had been
demonstrated. Adults with Chinese ethnicity demonstrated relatively extensive glucuronidation but lower
sulfation in paracetamol metabolism, when compared to
Caucasians. Whilst clinical relevance of this variation in
metabolic pathways remains uncertain, it is possible that
intrinsic differences in the pharmacogenetics of paracetamol metabolism may be a major reason for differences in hepatotoxicity between Asians and Caucasians.
Conclusions
This study has obvious limitations in the light of its' retrospective design. Nevertheless, its' large sample size, representative study population and accurate capture of
computerised laboratory data are its' major strengths. We
have demonstrated that the rates of hepatotoxicity among
1024 Asian patients with paracetamol overdose is low at
7.3%. Although differences in the clinical characteritics of
paracetamol overdose between Western and Asian
patients are recognised, it is possible that intrinsic differences in paracetamol metabolism may be a contributory
factor as well. Our data supports the findings from a recent study demonstrating that N-acetyl cysteine therapy is
not cost-effective in the management of Asian patients
with paracetamol overdose [26], and treatment algorithms
developed in the West may not be appropriate in the East.
