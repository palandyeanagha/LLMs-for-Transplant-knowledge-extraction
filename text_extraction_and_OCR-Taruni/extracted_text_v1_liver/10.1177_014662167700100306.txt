The CES-D Scale: A Self-Report Depression
Scale for Research in the General Population
Lenore Sawyer Radloff
Center for Epidemiologic Studies
National Institute of Mental Health
The CES-D scale is a short self-report scale
designed to measure depressive symptomatology in
the general population. The items of the scale are
symptoms associated with depression which have
been used in previously validated longer scales. The
new scale was tested in household interview surveys
and in psychiatric settings. It was found to have
very high internal consistency and adequate testretest repeatability. Validity was established by pat- terns of correlations with other self-report measures,
by correlations with clinical ratings of depression,
and by relationships with other variables which
support its construct validity. Reliability, validity,
and factor structure were similar across a wide
variety of demographic characteristics in the
general population samples tested. The scale should
be a useful tool for epidemiologic studies of depression.
The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D Scale) was developed for use
in studies of the epidemiology of depressive
symptomatology in the general population. Its
purpose differs from previous depression scales
which have been used chiefly for diagnosis at
clinical intake and/or evaluation of severity of
illness over the course of treatment. The CES-D
was designed to measure current level of depressive symptomatology, with emphasis on the affective component, depressed mood. The symptoms are among those on which a diagnosis of
clinical depression is based but which may also
accompany other diagnoses (including &dquo;normaI&dquo;) to some degree.
This definition of the variable being measured
determines the appropriate criteria of validity
and reliability (Standards for Educational and
Psychological Tests, 1974). Content validity will
be based on the clinical relevance of the symptoms which comprise the items of the scale.
Criterion-oriented validity will include correlations with other valid self-report depression
scales, correlations with clinical ratings of
severity of depression, and discrimination between psychiatric patients and general population samples. Construct validity will be based on
what is known about the theory and epidemiology of depressive symptoms. Evidence that the
scale is reliable but is also sensitive to current
levels of symptomatology will be based on
predictability of test-retest changes in scores
(e.g., scores of patients before and after treatment, or scores of household respondents before
and after &dquo;Life Events Losses&dquo;). Since several
comparable samples (essentially replications) were tested, consistency of results across the

samples will also be shown as indirect evidence
of reliability.
The CES-D was designed for use in general
population surveys, and is therefore a short,
structured self-report measure. It is usable by
lay interviewers, acceptable to the respondent,
and not substantially influenced by the normal
range of conditions during a household interview. The scale was designed for use in studies of
the relationships between depression and other
variables across population subgroups. To compare results from one subgroup to another, the
scale must be shown to measure the same thing
in both groups. Therefore, it will be shown that
properties of the scale (validity, reliability, factor
structure) are similar for the various population
subgroups to be studied.
Development of the Scale
The CES-D items were selected from a pool of
items from previously validated depression
scales (e.g. Beck, Ward, Mendelson, Mock, &
Erbaugh, 1961; Dahlstrom & Welsh, 1960;
Gardner, 1968; Raskin, Schulterbrandt, Reatig,
& McKeon, 1969; Zung, 1965). The major components of depressive symptomatology were
identified from the clinical literature and factor
analytic studies. These components included:
depressed mood, feelings of guilt and worthlessness, feelings of helplessness and hopelessness,
psychomotor retardation, loss of appetite, and
sleep disturbance. Only a few items were
selected to represent each component. Four
items were worded in the positive direction to
break tendencies toward response set as well as
to assess positive affect (or its absence). To emphasize current state, the directions read: &dquo;How
often this past week did you ... &dquo; Each response
was scored from zero to three on a scale of frequency of occurrence of the symptom.
Pretests on small &dquo;samples of convenience&dquo;
indicated appropriate performance of the scale
and guided minor revisions for clarity and
acceptability. The 20-item scale used in the
studies reported here is shown in Table 1. The
possible range of scores is zero to 60, with the
higher scores indicating more symptoms,
weighted by frequency of occurrence during the
past week.
Field Tests: Methods
First Questionnaire Survey (Ql Survey)
The CES-D scale was included in a structured
interview containing over 300 items, including
other scales designed to measure depression or
depressed mood (Bradburn Negative Affect,
1969; Lubin, 1967), psychological symptoms s
(Langner, 1962), well-being (Bradburn Positive
Affect, 1969; Cantril Ladder, 1965) and Social
Desirability (Crowne & Marlowe, 1960). It also
included standard sociodemographic items (age, sex, education, occupation, marital status) and
measures of life events, alcohol problems, social
functioning, physical illness and use of medications. The interview, which took about an hour,
was conducted by an experienced lay interviewer
in the home of the respondent.
Probability samples of households designed to
be representative of two communities (Kansas
City, Missouri, and Washington County, Maryland) were selected. An individual (aged 18 and
over) was randomly selected for interview from
each household in the sample. Independent
samples of households were designated for each
week of the study. Strong efforts were made to
complete interviews in the assigned week, but up
to three weeks (and unlimited numbers of callbacks) were allowed to maximize response rate.
Interviewing was done from October 1971
through January 1973 in Kansas City and from
December 1971 through July 1973 in Washington County. The response rate in Kansas City was about 75%, with a total of 1173 completed
interviews; in Washington County the response
rate was about 80%, with 1673 completed interviews. Informed consent was obtained from all
respondents. Both sites had a refusal rate of
about 17%, plus a small percentage of not-athome and other reasons for nonresponse.
Demographic distributions of the samples are

Table 1. CES-D Scale
reported elsewhere (Comstock & Helsing, in
press), as are analyses of characteristics of those
who refused to be interviewed (Comstock & Helsing, 1973; Klassen & Roth, 1974). Refusals
were significantly more likely to have lower education and come from smaller households than
respondents. Analyses have been made of respondents interviewed in the assigned week (&dquo;on
time&dquo;) versus the harder to find respondents interviewed in the following three weeks (&dquo;late&dquo;)
(Mebane, 1973). Males and working people were
slightly overrepresented among the &dquo;late&dquo; respondents, but the &dquo;late&dquo; did not differ from the
&dquo;on time&dquo; on the psychological measures in the
interview, including the CES-D scale. The samples probably have some underrepresentation of
males and the poorly educated. However, they
include respondents with a wide range of demographic characteristics, in numbers adequate for
analyses of relationships among variables.
Second Questionnaire Survey (Q2 Survey)
The CES-D scale was also included in a slightly revised (mainly shortened) version of the questionnaire (Q2) used in Washington County only,
from March 1973 through July 1974 (for three
months Q1 and Q2 were used alternately). SamDownloaded from the Digital Conservancy at the University of Minnesota, http://purl.umn.edu/93227.

ples were drawn for four-week periods. The revision was not expected to affect the CES-D,
since the scale was placed very early in both interviews, with identical preceding sections. The
major differences between the 01 and Q2 surveys were: length of interview (60 vs. 30
minutes); the time-basis of the sampling frame
(weekly vs. four-week); and the site (Kansas City
and Washington County vs. Washington County
otili,). The response rate for the Q2 survey was
about 75%, with 1089 completed interviews, and
about 22% refusals. Therefore, the obtained
sample for Q2 may be slightly less representative
than that of the Washington County QI survey.
Mail-backs
From May 1973 through March 1974, each respondent to Q2 was asked to fill out and mail
back one retest on the CES-D scale either two,
four, six, or eight weeks after the original interview. A total of 419 mail-backs was received
(about 56% response rate).
Reinterview Survey (Q3 Survey)
The CES-D was also included in a reinterview
(Q3) of samples of the original respondents to
01 or Q2. In Kansas City, from July 1973
through December 1973, 343 respondents (78%
of those attempted) were reinterviewed about 12
months after the original interview. From August 1973 through April 1974 in Washington
County, 1209 respondents (about 79% of those
attempted) were reinterviewed once-either
three, six, or twelve months after the original interview.
Psychiatric Patient Samples
Two clinical validation studies have been done
in coordination with the survey program: one in
Washington County, Maryland (Craig & Van
Natta, in press) and one in New Haven, Connecticut (Weissman. Prusoff & Newberry, 1975). In
the Washington County study, seventy patients
residing in a private psychiatric facility were
selected on the basis of willingness and ability to
participate. Each patient was rated on the Rockliff Depression Rating Scale (Rockliff, 1971) by
the nurse-clinician who was most familiar with
the patient’s current status. Immediately following this, the patient was interviewed by one of
the interviewers from the Washington County
general population survey, using the original interview form (Ql). In the New Haven Study,
thirty-five people admitted to outpatient treatment for severe depression and scoring seven or
higher on the Raskin Depression Rating Scale
(Raskin et al., 1969) participated in the study.
They were given the CES-D scale and the SCL90 (Derogatis, Lipman, & Covi, 1973) as self-reports and rated by clinicians on the Hamilton
Rating Scale (Hamilton, 1960) as well as the
Raskin. The measures were taken upon admission for treatment, after one week, and after
four weeks of treatment, using psychotropic
medication and supportive psychotherapy.
Summary of Field Tests
In the present paper, results will be reported
for the following populations: All Ql Whites,
All Q2 Whites, and All Q3 Whites (these analy- ses were confined to Whites to make the samples
comparable, since the Q2 sample contained less
than 3% nonwhites). These results are treated as
replications to demonstrate repeatability of the
properties of the scale across two samples considered equivalent (Ql vs. Q2) and across two
tests on essentially the same sample (Q 1 /Q2 vs.
Q3). For test-retest reliability, scores of the same
people at different times will be compared (Q2 vs. mail-backs and Q1 /Q2 vs. Q3). To demonstrate generalizability across different groups
and thereby justify the epidemiologic uses of the
scale, results will be compared across age, sex,
race, and educational subgroups of the combined Q1 and Q2 general populations and with
the Washington County patient group.

Suitability for Use in Household Surveys
Acceptability
The CES-D scale proved acceptable to both
general and clinical populations. In the 01 and
Q2 survey data, the average nonresponse to single items was less than 0.2%. Two items were answered &dquo;don’t know&dquo; or &dquo;not applicable&dquo; somewhat more often than average: &dquo;I felt I was just as good as other people&dquo; (1.6%) and &dquo;I felt hopeful about the future&dquo; (2.2%). For comparison,
the 01 item with the highest nonresponse was
household income (8%). The entire CES-D scale
was considered missing if more than four items
were missing. This occurred only twice in the Q1 l
and Q2 data combined.
Distributions
Parameters of the distributions of CES-D
scale scores in the general population samples
and the Washington County patients are shown
in Table 2. The distribution of scores in the patient group was symmetrical, with a large standard deviation, while the general population distributions were very skewed, with a smaller
standard deviation and a much larger proportion of low scores. This pattern is consistent with
an interpretation of the scale as related to a
pathological condition more typical of a patient
population than a household sample. However,
there was a wide enough range of scores in the
general population to allow meaningful identification of relationships between depressive symptomatology and other variables.
The very skewed distributions and the fact
that groups with higher means also tended to
have higher variances should be noted. Standard
parametric significance tests on these data will
not be exact. However, several basic analyses
(e.g., analysis of variance of CES-D scores by sex
and marital status) have been replicated using
normalizing transformations and nonparametric tests. In no case was the decision (accept vs. reject Ho) reversed. Nevertheless, probability
levels reported should be considered approximate, and borderline levels should be interpreted with caution.
Conditions of Interview
Controlling for age, race, sex, marital status,
income and occupational role, analyses of conditions during the interview revealed no significant
differences in the CES-D scores associated with
the time of day, day of week, or month of year in
which the interview took .place (tables available
on request). There were some differences in the
average CES-D scores obtained by the various
interviewers, significant at borderline levels,
which warrant further analyses (Choi & Comstock, 1975; Handlin et al., 1974). The Washing- ton County Q2 survey obtained significantly
lower CES-D scores than did the Washington
County Q1 survey. The Q3 reinterview survey
(Kansas City and Washington County combined) also had significantly lower average CESD scores than the initial (Q1 or Q2) survey of the
same respondents. Further analyses will be required to assess the relative contribution of
several factors (including possible real time
trends, response bias in test-retest effects, interview forms, possible nonresponse bias, and
sampling procedures).
These possible dif’crences (among interviewers and among me three surveys) are small
in magnitude and of minor practical importance. If further analyses confirm true differences, then suitable controls could be introduced in the sampling or analytic procedures. It
is more important for present purposes that the
properties.of the scale were consistent across interviewers and questionnaire forms. Analysis of
the interviewers (excluding those who completed
fewer than 20 interviews) revealed very similar
levels of reliability and patterns of relationships
to other variables across interviewers (tables
available on request). Results from the 01. Q2
and Q3 surveys are reported separately in subsequent sections of this paper to demonstrate that
they are also very similar on these properties.

Reliability
Internal Consistency
The scale contains 20 symptoms, any of which
may be experienced occasionally by healthy people ; a seriously depressed person would be expected to experience many but not necessarily
all of these symptoms. In a healthy population,
positive and negative affect are expected to coexist, with a low (negative) correlation. However,
it has been suggested (Klein, 1974) that severely
depressed patients are characterized by absence
of positive as well as presence of negative affect,
so that positive and negative affect would be
more highly (negatively) correlated. There is also
evidence that different kinds of people may
manifest different types of symptoms; e.g., lower
socioeconomic status people report more physical symptoms while higher socioeconomic
status people report more affective symptoms
(Crandell & Dohrenwend, 1967). In summary, in
a general population sample, we would expect a
great deal of heterogeneity, with many people
experiencing a few symptoms and a few experiencing many. Therefore, some inter-item
correlations may be quite low, but the direction
of correlations should be consistent enough to
produce reasonably high measures of internal
consistency. In a patient group, we would expect
higher item means, higher inter-item correlations, and very high internal consistency.
The results support these expectations (see
Table 3). Both inter-item and item-scale correlations were higher in the patient sample than in
the general population samples (even when the
small N and, therefore, greater sampling error of
the patient sample is taken into account). Expectations were also confirmed by measures of
internal consistency (coefficient alpha and the
Spearman-Brown, split-halves method; Nunnally, 1967). They were high in the general
population (about .85) and even higher in the
patient sample (about .90).
This high internal consistency may include
some component of response bias, i.e., the tendency of an individual to answer all questions in
the same (positive or negative) direction. In the
extreme, this would result in a bimodal distribution of scores, which was not observed in the
present data. Evidence of discriminant validity
and of validity based on clinician’s ratings, independent of self-report, also suggests that response bias is not the major contributor to the
reliability of the scale.
Test-retest Correlations
Predictions regarding test-retest correlations
depend on several factors. The CES-D scale was
explicitly designed to measure current (&dquo;this
week&dquo;) level of symptomatology, which is expected to vary over time. Changes over time may
not be monotonic; they are more likely to be
cyclic in at least some individuals, and the phase
(length) of cycles may vary across individuals.
The CES-D was designed to be sensitive to possible depressive reactions to events in a person’s
life; the timing of these events is unpredictable
but presumably aperiodic. There are also
methodological complications in test-retest
measures. For example, there may be biases due
to nonresponse, biasing effects of repeated testing, and asymmetric regression toward the mean
due to the very skewed distribution of CES-D
scores. Furthermore, in the present data, the
test-retest time interval was confounded with
differences in style of data collection: all initial
scores were based on interviews; the short-interval (weeks) retests were different (i.e., self-administered mail-backs); the long-interval
(months) retests were the same (i.e., interviews).
In light of these properties of the variable being measured, we would expect only moderate
levels of test-retest correlations in the overall
samples. Shorter test-retest time intervals
should produce somewhat higher correlations
than longer intervals. However, if people were
selected by the information we have about what
happened during the time interval, the correlations should be better differentiated. Specifically, life events are expected to introduce variability (i.e., some individuals may react more than
others) and thus lower the test-retest correlaDownloaded from the Digital Conservancy at the University of Minnesota, http://purl.umn.edu/93227.

tions. Tables 4 and 5 show that the results were
consistent with these predictions.
Table 4 shows the test-retest correlations for
those who responded to the request to fill out
and mail in a retest of the CES-D (mail-backs)
and those who were reinterviewed (Q3). All
respondents were retested only once; each time
interval represents a different group of people.
The correlations were in the moderate range (all
but one were between .45 and .70) and were, on
the average, larger for the shorter time intervals.
In Table 5, all Q3 respondents (test-retest
time interval ranging from three to twelve
months) were classified by whether any one of 14
negative life events had occurred in the year
prior to the first interview and in the interval between interviews. Those with no life events at
either time had the highest test-retest correlation ; those with life events at both times had the
lowest correlation. Those with events at one time
but not the other had intermediate correlations.
The correlation for those with no events (r = .54)
might be considered the fairest estimate of testretest reliability, in the sense of repeatability
with conditions replicated, for the three- to
twelve-month time interval. In the New Haven
patient group, the correlation of CES-D scores
at admission with scores obtained after four
weeks of treatment was .53 (compared with r =
.58 for the SCL-90). In this group, &dquo;events&dquo; had
certainly occurred, but the effect of treatment
may be assumed to be in the same direction for
all or most patients. Therefore, it is reasonable
that the correlation was about the same as that
in the &dquo;no events&dquo; group.
Validity
Although not designed for clinical diagnosis,
the CES-D scale is based on symptoms of depression as seen in clinical cases. Therefore, it

should discriminate strongly between patient
and general population groups, be sensitive to
levels of severity of depressive symtomatology,
and reflect improvements after psychiatric treatment. In addition, it should correlate well with
other scales designed to measure depression and
less well with scales which measure related but
different variables; be related to a felt need for
psychiatric services; and be sensitive to possible
reactive depression in the face of certain life
events.
Clinical Criteria
The CES-D scores discriminated well between
psychiatric inpatient and general population
samples and discriminated moderately among
levels of severity within patient groups. Table 2
shows that the average CES-D score for the
group of 70 Washington County psychiatric inpatients was substantially and significantly
higher than the average for the general population samples. Seventy percent of the patients but
only 21% of the general population scored at
and above an arbitrary cutoff score of 16. In the
patient group, the correlation between the CESD scale and ratings of severity of depression by
the nurse-clinician was .56 (Craig & Van Natta,
in press). In the New Haven patient group, the
average CES-D score at admission was 39.11,
with no score below 16 (note that this group was
screened to include only those above 6 on the
Raskin scale). The correlations of the CES-D
with the Hamilton Clinician’s Rating scale and
with the Raskin Rating scale were moderate (.44
to .54) at admission. After four weeks of treatment, the correlations were substantially higher
(.69 to .75). These correlations were almost as
high as those obtained for the 90-item SCL 90
(Weissman et al., 1975).
Self-report Criteria
Table 6 shows correlations of the CES-D scale
with other self-report scales in the several samples. (Note that Q2 and Q3 did not include all
scales.) In all the samples, the pattern of correlations of the CES-D with other scales gives reasonable evidence of discriminant validity. The
highest r’s were with scales designed to measure
symptoms of depression (i.e., Lubin, Bradburn
Negative Affect and Bradburn Balance) or general psychopathology (Langner) and the Cantril
Ladder. The correlation of the CES-D with the
Bradburn Positive Affect scale was negative and
was low positive with scales designed to measure
different variables (medications, disability days,
social functioning, aggression). The CES-D correlated moderately with interviewer ratings of
depression but low negative to zero with interviewer ratings of cooperation and understanding
of the question.
Table 6 also shows support for the concept of
a &dquo;syndrome&dquo; of depression which is more consistent in the patient sample than in the general
population samples. In the patient groups, the
correlations with other depression scales were
higher positive (in the New Haven patients, correlation with the SCL-90 was .83); with the
Bradburn Positive Affect, higher negative; and
with other scales, the same low positive.
The low negative correlations with the Marlowe-Crowne scale of &dquo;social desirability&dquo; suggest that there may be some general response set
involved in the CES-D scores (see also Klassen,
Hornstra, & Anderson, 1975). However, the pattern of correlations in Table 6 suggests that this
bias is small and does not entirely mask meaningful relationships with other variables.

problem in the past week for which they felt they
needed help. The group who answered the &dquo;need
help&dquo; question &dquo;yes&dquo; or &dquo;no, because it’s no use
to look for help&dquo; are considered &dquo;at risk&dquo; of becoming patients. Table 7 shows parameters of
the CES-D scale by answers to this question.
The Washington County patient population is
included for comparison. The general population &dquo;need help&dquo; groups were more similar to
the patients than were the &dquo;not need help&dquo;
groups. The &dquo;need help&dquo; groups had high means (significantly higher than the &dquo;not need
help&dquo; groups) and standard deviations, symmetrical distributions (low skew), high percentages
of high scores (16 and above), and moderately
high correlations with the Bradburn Positive Affect scale. The patterns of correlations with the
Bradburn Positive and Negative Affect scales
can also be considered in terms of discriminant
validity.
Life Events
Past research has shown an association of illness, including mental illness, with certain significant life events (Dohrenwend & Dohrenwend, 1974). Table 8 shows the average CES-D
scores for those who do and do not report certain
events in the year (or during the retest interval
for Q3) preceding the interview. The results were
as predicted: the more negative the event, the
higher the depression score of those who experienced it. Vacations were associated with low
CES-D scores (possibly biased by socioeconomic
status); marriage was ambiguous; separation was more strongly associated with depression
than was divorce.
Table 9 shows the interview-reinterview (i.e.,
QI/Q2 vs. Q3) CES-D scores by Life Events
Losses (using the same criterion of Life Events
Losses as was used for Table 5). The overall
trend was for lower scores on Q3 than on the original interview, except in the group with no
events before the first interview and at least one
event in the retest interval. The four groups were
significantly different in amount of change in
CES-D score by several different methods of

testing change scores. These relationships of the
CES-D scores to life events are considered validation of its sensitivity to current mood state,
which is a property desired for the scale.
Improvement After Treatment
Further evidence of response to change is furnished by the New Haven clinical study (Weissman, et al., 1975). The average CES-D score,
along with the SCL 90, the Hamilton, and the
Raskin, decreased significantly from the time of
admission to one week and to four weeks of
treatment (see Table 10). The mean for each of
the 20 items was lower after four weeks of threatment than upon admission (tables available on
request). The change was particularly large for
patients rated &dquo;recovered&dquo; (by a Raskin score of
less than 7) after four weeks. The average CESD score went down 20 points in the recovered
group and 12 points in the group rated &dquo;still ill.&dquo;
Factor Analysis
Principal components factor analysis (with
ones in the main diagonal) of the 20-item scale
was done for the three general population
groups (All Ql Whites, All Q2 Whites, and All
Q3 Whites). For each group, there were four
eigenvalues greater than one, which together accounted for a total of 48% of the variance; therefore, the normal varimax rotation to four factors
was examined (see Table 11). The pattern of factor loadings is quite consistent across the three
groups. Including items with loadings above .40
in all three groups, the four factors are readily
interpretable as follows: °
I. Depressed affect (blues, depressed. lonelv.
crv sad)
II. Positive affect (good, hopeful, happy, enJoy)
III. Somatic and retarded activity (bothered,
appetite, effort, sleep, get going)
IV. Interpersonal ~un friendlv, dislike)

Including items with loadings of at least .35 in at
least two groups would add the items ,failure
fearful, happy. and enjoy to the depressed affect
factor and the items blues, mind, depressed. and
talk to the somatic factor. In all three groups,
the depressed affect factor shares the largest
proportion of the variance (about 16%) and the
interpersonal factor, the smallest proportion
(about 8%).
Similarity of factor structure of the three samples was estimated by the Factorial Invariance
Coefficient, ri, (Derogatis, Kallmen, & Davis,
197l ; Derogatis, Serio, & Cleary, 1972; Pinneau
& Newhouse, 1964). The ri, is a measure of the
correlation of the loadings of all items on one
factor in one group versus the loadings on one
factor in another group. If the factor structure of
two groups is similar, the r;,, will be very high
when loadings on the same factor in both groups
are correlated (the &dquo;diagonal&dquo; coefficients) and
very low when d(fferent factors are correlated
(the &dquo;off-diagonal&dquo; coefficients). Comparing Q1
with Q2 and Ql with Q3, the diagonal coefficients were very high (.87 to .99). The offdiagonal coefficients (i.e., the similarity of dif
ferent factors) were very low (the largest was .13).
This is very strong evidence that the CES-D has
a similar factor structure in two samples from
similar populations (Ql vs. Q2) and across two
tests on essentially the same sample (Ql vs. Q3).
The factors found in the general population are consistent with the components of depression built into the scale. However, the high internal consistency of the scale found in all groups
argues against undue emphasis on separate factors. The items are all symptoms related to depression. For epidemiologic research, a simple
total score is recommended as an estimate of the
degree of depressive symptomatology.
Generalizability Across Subgroups
To be useful fur epidemiologic studies (e.g.,
distribution of depression across demographic
subgroups), the CES-D scale must have adequate reliability and validity and a similar factor structure within each subgroup of the population. Therefore, the analyses of Tables 3, 4, 6,
7 and 11 were repeated on each of three age
groups (under 25, 25-64, over 64), the two sexes,
two races (Black and White), three levels of education (less than high school, high school,
greater than high school), and the two &dquo;need

help&dquo; groups (&dquo;need help,&dquo; &dquo;not need help&dquo;).
For these analyses, the data from Kansas City
and Washington County Q1 and Q2 were combined to maximize numbers in the subgroups.
With few exceptions, the results for the total
population were confirmed in all subgroups. (tables available on request). In all subgroups, coefficient alpha was .80 or above. Test-retest correlations were moderate (.40 or above) in all but
three groups (Blacks, age under 25, and &dquo;need
help&dquo;). The subgroup patterns of correlations
with other scales (as in Table 6) and relationships to &dquo;need help&dquo; (as in Table 7) were very
similar to those in the total population. The subgroups did not differ from each other or from
the total population in factor structure. The
&dquo;need help&dquo; group (which had been found to be
similar to the Washington County patient group
by various criteria above) was not like that patient group in factor structure but was very similar to the total general population.
Cautions and Conclusions
Some limitations in use of the scale should be
noted. It is not intended as a clinical diagnostic
tool, and interpretations of individual scores
should not be made. Even group averages
should be interpreted in terms of level of symptoms which accompany depression, not in terms
of rates of illness. Appropriate cutoff scores for
clinical screening are yet to be validated. There
are some hints that understanding of the items
may be a problem; there was a very small but
consistent correlation between the CES-D score
and the interviewer ratings of understanding of
the questions, independent of education of the
respondent. Analyses indicate that this was not
simply due to respondents who did not notice
the reversal of the positive items. Special caution
is needed with bilingual respondents (Trieman,
1975). Further study of this issue is needed, with
possible revision for simplicity of wording and
removal of colloquial expressions. There is still
some question as to the effect of the interviewer
and the interview form on the mean level of scale
scores. Until further study decides this issue, a
sampling design balanced by interviewer may be
appropriate.
On the positive side, the results reported here
are very favorable for the uses of the CES-D
scale for which it was designed. The scale has
high internal consistency, acceptable test-retest
stability, excellent concurrent validity by clinical
and self-report criteria, and substantial evidence
of construct validity. These properties hold
across the general population subgroups
studied. The scale is suitable for use in Black
and White English-speaking American populations of both sexes with a wide range of age and
socioeconomic status for the epidemiologic
study of the symptoms of depression. A group
with a high average score may be interpreted to
be &dquo;at risk&dquo; of depression or in need of treatment. The scale is a valuable tool to identify
such high-risk groups and to study the relationships between depressive symptoms and many
other variables.
