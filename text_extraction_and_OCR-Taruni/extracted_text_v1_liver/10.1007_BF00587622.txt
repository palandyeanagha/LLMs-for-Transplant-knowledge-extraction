Summary. Long-term normalization of glucose metabolism is necessary to prevent or ameliorate diabetic complications. Although pancreatic grafting is able to restore 
normal blood glucose and glycated haemoglobin, the degree of normalization of the deranged diabetic metabolism 
after pancreas transplantation is still questionable. Consequently glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, and pancreatic polypeptide responses to oral glucose and i.v. arginine were measured in 36 Type 1 (insulin-dependen0 diabetic recipients of pancreas and kidney aUografts and compared to ten healthy control subjects. Despite normal 
HbA1 (7.2_+0.2%; normal <8%) glucose disposal was norreal only in 44% and impaired in 56% of the graft recipients, Normalization of glucose tolerance was achieved at 
the expense of hyperinsulinaemia in 52% of the subjects. 
C-peptide and glucagon were normal, while pancreatic 
polypeptide was significantly higher in the graft recipients, Intravenous glucose tolerance (n=21) was normal 
in 67% and borderline in 23%. Biphasic insulin release 
was seen in patients with normal glucose tolerance. Glucose tolerance did not deteriorate up to 7 years post-transplant. In addition, stress hormone release (cortisol, growth 
hormone, prolactin, glucagon, catecholamines) to insulininduced hypoglycaemia was examined in 20 graft recipients and compared to eight healthy subjects. Reduced 
blood glucose decline indicates insulin resistance, but glucose recovery was normal, despite markedly reduced catecholamine and glucagon release. These data demonstrate 
the effectiveness of pancreatic grafting in normalizing glucose metabolism, although hyperinsulinaemia and deranged counterregulatory hormone response are observed 
frequently.

Introduction 
To prevent or ameliorate vascular and neurological complications normalization of glucose metabolism is necessary (Hanssen et al. 1986). So far the only way to achieve 
long-term normoglycaemia in Type 1 (insulin-dependent) 
diabetes is pancreatic grafting (Land and Landgraf 1987; 
Dubernard and Sutherland 1989; Groth 1989; Najarian et 
al. 1990). However, not all successfully transplanted diabetic patients have a complete normalization of their diabetic metabolism such as impaired glucose utilization 
after oral or/and intravenous glucose load (Ostman et al. 
1988; Landgraf et al. 1989; Diem et al. 1990a; Osei et al. 
1990), hyperinsulinaemia (Diem et al. 1990a; Luzi et al. 
1990) or persistence of defective counterregulatory hormonal responses to glycopaenia (Bosi et al. 1988; Landgraf et 
al. 1989; Diem et al. 1990b). The presence or absence of 
improvements of these metabolic and endocrine parameters 
are highly relevant in the judgement of the overall benefit 
of pancreas transplantation. 
Therefore, a prospective study has been undertaken in 
pancreatic transplant recipients to evaluate glucose tolerance by measuring glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, 
and pancreatic polypeptide after oral and intravenous glucose load. In addition, hormonal counterregulation to hypoglycaemia was assessed by determining glucose, C-peptide, glucagon, growth hormone, prolactin, catecholamines, and cortisol during insulin-induced hypoglycaemia. 
In this study the responses of pancreas recipients were 
compared to non-diabetic healthy control subjects. 
Subjects and Methods 
Subjects Thirty-six Type 1 diabetic recipients of pancreas and kidney allografts using duct occlusion for segmental pancreatic grafting 
(n=28) or pancreaticoduodenal-cystostomy for exocrine drainage 
(n=8) all with iliac vessel anastomoses (Land et al. 1987), were 
studied one to 103 months after successful grafting (Table 1). A graft 
was considered successfully functional when there was no further insulin requiring therapy and normal HbA I levels and normal daily 
blood glucose measurements. Immunosuppression was achieved in 
most patients with triple-drug therapy of azathioprine 

$62 
(25-75 mg daffy), cyclosporin (whole blood trough levels 200-300 
ng/ml using polyclonal antibodies) and low dose prednisone 
(6• rag; 2-20 rag/daily). Healthy volunteers of similar age/sex 
distribution and body mass index served as control subjects. All 
subjects gave their informed consent and the tests started after an 
overnight fast at 08.00 hours while on bed rest without taking immunosuppressive drags. ALl tests were not performed on all subjects. 
Oral glucose i,v. arginine tolerance tests. Oral glucose tolerance tests 
were performed on 36 pancreas recipients and 10 healthy control subjects (Control subjects 1, Table 1). The pancreas recipients were 
tested prospectively every six months. 100 g glucose (i.e. 400 ml 
Dextro-OGT Boehringer, Mannheim, FRG) was ingested within 5 
min. An intravenous line was placed in an antecubital vein for blood 
sampling for glucose, C-peptide, insulin, glucagon, and pancreatic 
polypeptide determinations. Blood samples were taken before 
(0 rain) as well as 30, 60, and 120 min after oral glucose load. 
At 120 min an intravenous arginine infusion was started for 30 min 
(250 ml 6% arginine solution = 15 g arginine) and blood was drawn 
at 125, 130, 140, 150, and 180 min after glucose load. This combined glucose/arginine test was designed to measure glucose4nduced 
glucagon suppression and arginine-induced glucose-potentiation of 
insulin release as well as arginine-provoked glucagon secretion. 
Glucose tolerance was defined as normal when basal and 2h venous 
blood glucose was less than 6.7 retool/1 (WHO criteria). 
Intravenous glucose tolerance tests. In order to compare glucose utilization after oral glucose with the response after intravenous glucose 
21 pancreas recipients were injected rapidly with glucose (0.5 g/kg 
body weight within 2 rain) and serum glucose, C-pepdde, insulin, and 
glucagon were measured before (0 rain) and 5, 10, 15, 25, 35, 45, 
55, and 65 rain after glucose load. The glucose assimilation 
coefficients (Kg) were calculated using the slope of the linear 
regression equation for the natural log glucose concentration at the 
time of 10 to 65 min. (diabetic < 0.9, borderline 0.9-1.1, normal > 
1.1%/rain).

Insulin-induced hypoglycaemia. Twenty diabetic patients with successful pancreatic grafting and eight healthy subjects (Control subjects 2, Table 1) underwent insulin-induced hypoglycaemia tests. 
Two baseline values were collected (-15 and 0 rain) before 0.075 
1U/kg human insulin was injected i.v. as a bolus and blood was collected at 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, and 120 min for measurements of 
glucose, C-peptide, glucagon, growth hormone, prolactin, epinephrine, nor-epinephrine and cortisol. The tests were performed (2- 
4 months) post-transplant. In two patients the tests were repeated 12 
months post-transplant. 
Methods Plasma glucose was measured by the glucose oxidase method 
using a Hitachi autoanalyzer (Boehringer, Mannheim, FRG). Stable 
HbA 1 was determined by an electrophoretic method (Ciba-Coming, 
Munich, FRG; normal range: 5.5-8.0%). Serum insulin and C-peptide 
concentrations were measured by a standard double antibody radioimmunoassay (I.R.E., Fleurus, Belgium). Insulin antibodies were not 
detectable in our patients. The blood samples for the determination of 
plasma glucagon according to Heding (1979), and eatecholam/nes 
according to Passon and Peuler (1973) and Peuler and Iohnson (1977) 
were transferred into prechiUed tubes with the appropriate ingredients 
quickly centrifuged at 4~ and stored at -70~ Growth hormone (yon 
Werder 1975), prolactin (yon Werder 1975), and cortisol (Stalla et al. 
1981) determinations were measured by standard analytical 
procedures. Pancreatic polypeptide was determined by 
radioimmunoassay according to Riepl et al. (1990). 
Statistical analysis. Data are given as means • SEM unless otherwise 
stated. The Mann-Whimey U test was used to test differences between 
graft recipients and control subjects. For the prospective study of 
oral glucose tolerance and islet hormone release the Wilcoxon 
signed-rank test for paired samples was applied. All tests were twotailed. Significance was considered at a p value <0.05.

Oral glucose-i.v, arginine tolerance 
Cross-sectional study 
Although there were no further exogenous insulin requirements and the patients showed normal daily blood 
glucose profiles by self-monitoring and normal haemoglobin A1 levels (7.2+0.2%) at the time of testing, oral 
glucose tolerance was completely normalized in only 
44%, whereas the others had impaired glucose disposal 
(Fig. 1). 
While C-peptide levels were within the normal range 
and differed between the patients with normal and impaired 
glucose utilization only at 60 min (p<0.025), the insulin 
secretory response after glucose stimulation was markedly 
elevated in those pancreas recipients with normal glucose 
tolerance (at 30 rain p<0.025 and at 60 rain p<0.005). 
After additional arginine stimulation insulin release was 
biphasic and higher in both diabetic recipient groups when 
compared to healthy control subjects. Glucagon levels 
were above the normal range in all patients during glucose-induced glucagon suppression and arginine-provoked 
release, although there was a high variability between 
patients. Basal pancreatic polypeptide (hPP) levels were 
significantly higher in pancreas/kidney recipients compared with control subjects (12.8+7.5 vs 29.2+5.5 
pmol/l; p<0.01). After glucose load hPP increased in 
transplanted individuals to a maximum of 43.7+9.3 
pmoYl at 30 min and decreased to basal levels, while hPP 
remained unchanged in healthy control subjects (Fig. 2).

During arginine infusion in both groups hPP was

in the graft recipients. 
Prospective study 
Time-dependent integrated responses (0-120 min) of blood 
glucose, C-peptide, insulin, and glucagon after oral glucose are depicted in Figure 3. The areas under the timeconcentration curves obtained two months posttransplant 
were set to 100% and were compared to the values 1 to 7 
years after successful grafting. Oral glucose tolerance did 
not deteriorate except temporarily at 2 years post-transplant (p<0.05) although glycated haemoglobin remained 
normal (not shown). Insulin secretory response was very 
similar in the different time periods, while C-peptide 
levels remained the same except at 4 years, where it drolY 
ped significantly (p<0.05). Glueagon response decreased 
markedly (p<0.05) 4 years post-transplant. Since polypeptide hormone levels are also dependent on renal function 
creatinine levels were analysed. They were slightly elevated (Table 1) but did not change during time, indicating 
a good and stable kidney graft function and suggest that 
decreased hormone levels are mainly due to reduced secretory capacity rather than changes in renal clearance. When 
following three pancreas recipients over more than 6 years 
post-transplant time-dependent integrated responses after 
oral glucose load, glucose tolerance remained stable independent of the initial graft function (Fig. 4). Also, I-IbA1 
levels were normal throughout the observation period (not 
shown). Hormone response fluctuated considerably with a 
clear tendency toward reduced insulin secretory capacity in 
all patients by 5 years post-transplant.

blood glucose (a), insulin (b), C-peptide (c), and glucagon (d) in graft 
recipients (n=21) with normal (left; n=14) and impaired (right; n=7) 
glucose utilization. 
Intravenous glucose tolerance 
Gastroparesis due to autonomic neuropathy might interfere 
with oral glucose tolerance, simulating normal glucose 
disposal. Therefore, i.v. glucose tolerance testing was performed in 21 graft recipients and compared to their oral 
glucose tolerance. Fourteen patients (67%) showed normal 
glucose disappearance rates (2.0 + 0.5 %/min) and seven 
had borderline Kg-values (1.01 + 0.03 %/min), none of 
them, however, was diabetic (Kg<0.9 %/min; Fig. 5). A 
biphasic glucose-induced insulin release pattern was noted 
in those patients with a normal glucose utilization. In 
contrast, patients with impaired glucose tolerance had 
much lower and monophasic insulin secretory profiles. 
The C-peptide levels increased also much more sluggishly 
in these patients. When the results of the i.v. and the oral 
glucose tolerance tests were correlated the following was 
found: normal values in both tests in eight patients, impaired glucose tolerance in both tests in four patients, normal oral glucose tolerance and impaired i.v. glucose toleInsulin-induced hypoglycaemia 
Blood glucose 
The blood glucose nadir was significantly lower in control 
patients compared with the transplant recipients (1.6 + 0.1 
vs 2.5 -+ 0.3 mmol/1; p<0.05; Fig. 6). The fall in blood 
glucose was somewhat slower in the recipients than in the 
control subjects. Blood glucose recovery was very similar 
in both groups. In two patients tested 12 months posttransplant comparable blood glucose nadirs and the same 
rate of glucose decline and recovery (up to 60 min) with 
those of the control subjects were measured. 
C-peptide 
C-peptide levels were much higher in organ recipients 
early and late posttransplant than in healthy subjects indicating insulin resistance and/or diminished renal C-peptide 
clearance. However, C-peptide was similar suppressible in 

R. Landgraf et al.: Metabolic and hormonal study after pancreas grafting 
the three subgroups (controls: A = 1.3 _+ 0.1 nghnl; recipients: A = 2.3 _+ 0.3 and 2.1 ng/ml early and late posttransplant; p<0.01). 
Glucagon 
Basal glucagon was significantly higher in normal individuals (191.2 _+ 32.6 pg/ml) than in transplant patients 
(86.6 + 11.2 pg/ml; p<0.01). There was a rapid release 
during hypoglycaemia reaching a maximal incremental 
glucagon response (Amax) in control subjects (101.5 + 
20.9 pg/ml) and in transplant patients (69.3 _+ 13 pg/ml) 
which, however, was much greater in the control subjects. 
There was no improvement of glucagon response to hypoglycaemia 12 months posttransplant. 
Catecholamines 
Epinephrine and norepinephrine release during hypoglycaemia was significantly reduced in pancreas/kidney recipients when compared to the healthy control subjects 
(Fig. 5). There was a tendency toward improved catecholamine response 12 months after transplantation, but due 
to the small number of patients tested (n=2) the data are 
only preliminary. 
Growth hormone and prolactin 
Basal growth hormone was very similar in both groups 
(Fig. 5) but was less stimulated in the pancreatic recipients when compared to the control subjects. The two patients tested 12 months post-transplant showed a marked 
stimulated growth hormone release. 
Prolactin in the basal state was higher in the recipients 
and could not be stimulated during hypoglycaemia. This 
defective hormone release could not be demonstrated 12 
months after pancreatic grafting. 
Cortisol 
Cortisol release is difficult to judge since most of the patents received prednisone for immunosuppression (4 to 
16 mg daily; the last dose 24 h prior to the test) and 
therefore the endogenous corfisol release was partially 
suppressed. One year posttransplant the two recipients 
tested had no further glucocorticoid medication and revealed a normal basal and stimulated cortisol release.

minished islet cell mass as indicated by significant reduction of insulin release after glucose challenge rather than

is very important in glucose homeostasis (Weir et al.

Discussion 
After successful pancreatic and kidney transplantation daily 
blood glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin can be normalized for many years. However, oral and intravenous 
glucose tolerance are impaired in 30 to 50% of the recipients in this cross-sectional analysis. One of the reasons for the rather high rate of impaired glucose utilization is the experimental set-up in which maximal glucose 
doses were used (100 g orally and 0.5 g/kg i.v.), and the 
criteria for normalization of glucose tolerance were very 
strict. The impaired glucose disposal might be due to diFig. 6. Blood glucose, C-peptide, growth hormone, prolactin, glucagon, cortisol, and catecholamine before and after regular insulin as 
bolus i.v. (0.075 IU/kg) in healthy control subjects (n=8; H) and

ly, loss of Beta-cells by post-operative pancreatitis and/or 
rejection episodes. Recurrence of the autoimmune process 
(Sutherland et al. 1984) in these patients is rather improbable since there was a high degree of HLA-mismatching. The transplantation of only a pancreas segment 
rather than the whole organ is probably less important, 
since only 25% of the recipients in our study with normal 

$66 
glucose tolerance had a whole pancreas graft while the 
others received prolamine duct occluded pancreatic segments. This observation is supported by findings of the 
Stockholm and Oslo groups comparing the metabolic outcome of pancreas segments vs whole organ recipients 
(Tyd6n et al. 1989). 
Assessment of glucose homeostasis by oral glucose 
tolerance tests or mixed meals in pancreas recipients with 
severe secondary diabetic complications might be 
questionable, since autonomic dysfunction with clinically 
relevant gastroparesis is common in those patients 
(Nusser et al. 1988). Therefore, intravenous glucose tolerance tests eliminating this potential problem are desirable. When 21 patients of our study group were tested, 
twelve (57%) showed corresponding test results for oral 
and intravenous glucose load, while 29% revealed impaired 
oral glucose tolerance with normal i.v. glucose tolerance 
and 14% vice versa. The statement of normalization of 
glucose metabolism in pancreas recipients therefore can 
only be relevant when the technical details of the kind of 
testing are clearly defined. 
Normal glucose metabolism is achieved at the expense 
of basal and stimulated hyperinsulinaemia. The higher 
insulin levels are mainly due to the systemic rather than 
the physiological portal venous drainage of islet cell secretory products (Diem et al. 1990a) with reduced first pass 
hepatic extraction of insulin (Eaton et al. 1983). However, 
as discussed by Diem et al. (1990a), basal elevated insulin 
and C-peptide levels in pancreas recipients may be a 
physiological response by the graft to increased glucose 
output from the liver. But hepatic glucose production both 
basal and post insulin clamp have been reported as being 
not different from healthy conlrol subjects in Type 1 diabetic patients after combined kidney and pancreas transplantation (Luzi et al. 1990). Hyperinsulinaemia might 
therefore reflect, at least to some extent, peripheral insulin 
resistance mainly caused by the steroid medication (Baron 
et al. 1987), which most of our patients received. However, that hyperinsulinaemia is not a prerequisite to 
achieving normal glucose disposal in heterotopic allogenic 
pancreas recipients is supported by our findings showing 
that 52% of the grafted patients had normal oral glucose 
tolerance plus a normal insulin secretory profile. In view 
of the potential vascular risk of chronic hyperinsulinaemia 
(Jarret 1988) normal basal and postprandial insulin levels 
have to be one of the aims of pancreatic grafting. 
Pancreatic polypeptide, which is secreted after arginine 
stimulation but not after glucose load in healthy subjects 
(Glaser et al. 1980; Schwartz 1983) could be slightly 
stimulated by glucose but not by arginine in pancreas recipients. The significantly higher PP levels in graft recipients when compared to healthy control subjects is 
probably due to a reduced renal clearance. Pancreatic 
polypepfide responses to hypoglycaemia were significantly diminished in graft recipients compared with control 
subjects (Diem et al. 1990b). However, pancreatic polypeptide values did not differ significantly in graft recipients and non-recipient Type 1 diabetic subjects. It was 
therefore suggested that secretion of this hormone occurs 
from the native pancreas only (Diem et al. 1990b). Since 
pancreatic polypeptide release requires innervation of the 
R. Landgraf et al.: Metabolic and hormonal study after pancreas grafting 
pancreas (Schwartz 1983) this hormone seems not to be 
an adequate measure of graft function. However, if in 
longitudinal studies the levels of laPP increase in pancreas 
recipients this might indicate reinnervafion of the grafted 
organ. 
Defective hormonal counterregulation after insulin-induced hypoglycaemia has been reported in insulin-dependent diabetes (Bolli et al. 1983; Amiel et al 1987). This 
might be a serious problem for the patient and reduces the 
qualitiy of his/her life. Pancreatic grafting is therefore also 
aimed at improving or even restoring the deranged counterregulation of hypoglycaemia. There are only a few reports 
on stress-hormone release and glucose-regulatory response 
to insulin-induced hypoglycaemia (Bosi et al. 1988; 
Landgraf et al. 1989; Diem et al. 1990b). In contrast to recent data (Diem et al. 1990b) basal glucagon and its responses to insulin-induced hypoglycaemia were markedly 
lower in the pancreas recipients under study compared with 
the healthy control subjects. One of the reasons might be 
that the glucose nadir after insulin injection was significantly lower in the control subjects than in the patients. 
However, this does not explain the lower basal glucagon 
values. In addition, the decreased glucagon responsivity in 
graft recipients is only seen to glycopaenic signalling but 
not observed after arginine stimulation. Normal substrateregulated glucagon release can be demonstrated not only 
for arginine-provoked release, but also for glucose-induced 
hormone suppression, indicating that the autonomic nervous system is not necessary for the glucagon release 
mechanisms. However, all data concerning glucagon release are difficult to interpret since it is not known, how 
much circulating glucagon is coming from the native 
gland and how much is released by the grafted pancreas. 
Despite hypoglucagonaemia and a significant reduction 
in catecholamine release glucose recovery from hypoglycaemia was comparable to normal subjects. The 
blunted response of epinephrine and norepinephrine release 
in our patients indicates severe autonomic dysfunction 
which could be demonstrated in all recipients by cardiac 
autonomic neuropathy. Since many patients of Diem et 
al. (1990b) were studied 3 months posttransplant which is 
comparable to our study protocol their findings of normal 
epinephrine levels before and during insulin tolerance 
testing can only be interpreted by differences in patient 
selection. The prospective analysis of two of our patients 
-although still very preliminary- shows that defective 
hormonal counterregulation especially of glucagon and 
catecholamines cannot be restored by 12 months after 
transplantation. 
From these studies it can be concluded that longterm 
improvement of the deranged diabetic metabolism is possible after successful pancreatic grafting. However, in 
long-standing diabetes some aspects of the metabolic disturbances such as defective counterregulatory responses 
cannot be reversed easily and due to the necessary chronic 
immunosuppression insulin resistance might appear or 
persist. Therefore, pancreatic grafting should only be performed in well-selected patients and in centres with the 
possibility of a multidisciplinary follow-up of the patient.
