Abstract
Objective Patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis 
(PSC) were previously shown to display a bacterial gut 
dysbiosis but fungal microbiota has never been examined 
in these patients. The aim of this study was to assess the 
fungal gut microbiota in patients with PSC.
Design We analysed the faecal microbiota of patients 
with PSC and concomitant IBD (n=27), patients with 
PSC and no IBD (n=22), patients with IBD and no PSC
(n=33) and healthy subjects (n=30). Bacterial and fungal 
composition of the faecal microbiota was determined 
using 16S and ITS2 sequencing, respectively.
Results We found that patients with PSC harboured 
bacterial dysbiosis characterised by a decreased 
biodiversity, an altered composition and a decreased 
correlation network density. These alterations of the 
microbiota were associated with PSC, independently of 
IBD status. For the first time, we showed that patients 
with PSC displayed a fungal gut dysbiosis, characterised 
by a relative increase in biodiversity and an altered 
composition. Notably, we observed an increased 
proportion of Exophiala and a decreased proportion of 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Compared with patients with 
IBD and healthy subjects, the gut microbiota of patients 
with PSC exhibited a strong disruption in bacteria-fungi 
correlation network, suggesting an alteration in the 
interkingdom crosstalk.
Conclusion This study demonstrates that bacteria and 
fungi contribute to gut dysbiosis in PSC.
Introduction
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic 
cholestatic liver disease characterised by inflammatory and fibro-obliterative lesions of the biliary 
tract. Disease course in PSC is highly variable, but 
often progressive, leading to cirrhosis. Effective 
medical therapy is currently lacking so that liver 
transplantation is the only life-extending therapeutic intervention in patients with end-stage PSC 
liver disease.1 2 Noticeably, a majority (up to 80%) 
of subjects with PSC have a concomitant IBD, 
most often UC.3
 Both IBD and PSC are multifactorial diseases the pathogenesis of which remains to 
elucidate. They share a number of common genetic 
risk factors,4
 although genetic factors account for 
only a small fraction of disease liability in PSC.5 6
There is evidence to indicate that the gut microbiota is altered and triggers an exacerbated immune 
response in IBD.7
 Alterations in the composition of 
the gut microbiota that were found in IBD include a 
reduction of microbial diversity, a decrease in some 
species of the Firmicutes phylum and an increase in 
species of the Proteobacteria phylum.8 9 Recently, 
several studies have shown that the composition 
of the gut microbiota was altered also in patients 
with PSC.10–19 Alterations that have been reported 
in PSC consist in a reduction of biodiversity, a 
decrease in bacteria of the Firmicutes phylum 
(such as Faecalibacterium) as well as an increase 
in some Proteobacteria (such as Morganella) and 
in some bacteria usually found in the oral microbiota (such as Veillonella).11 13–16 18 All studies in 
PSC have been focused on bacterial dysbiosis. 
However, other types of microorganisms colonise 
the human gut including fungi. Fungal dysbiosis 
has been described in alcoholic liver disease and 
cirrhosis,20 21 as well as in IBD.22 In the latter case, 
biodiversity was decreased and the fungi-to-bacteria 
ratio increased, notably in patients with IBD flare.22
So far, no study has addressed potential changes in 
Significance of this study
What is already known on this subject?
► Bacterial gut dysbiosis has been shown to occur 
in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis 
(PSC).
► PSC is frequently associated with IBD.
► Patients with IBD display both bacterial and 
fungal gut dysbiosis.
What are the new findings?
► Patients with PSC bear fungal gut dysbiosis, 
combining an altered composition and 
increased biodiversity.
► The signature of fungal gut dysbiosis in patients 
with PSC is distinct from that of patients with 
IBD.
► In patients with PSC, the gut microbiota is 
characterised by a disruption in the correlation 
network between bacteria and fungi.
How might it impact on clinical practice in the 
foreseeable future?
► These data suggest that gut fungi could 
contribute to the pathogenesis of PSC and 
therefore should be considered as a new target 
for future therapeutic strategies.

Gut microbiota
fungal microbiota (mycobiota) in PSC. Yet, a number of observations point out to a possible role of fungi in the pathogenesis 
or progression of PSC. First, anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies are highly prevalent in patients with PSC.23 Second, bile 
can be colonised by Candida albicans in patients with PSC and 
the presence of Candida in bile was shown to be associated with 
a poor prognosis in these patients.24 Third, genetic variants of 
caspase recruitment domain-9, a protein involved in the innate 
immunity against fungi, provide susceptibility to both PSC and 
IBD.4
 Therefore, in keeping with these lines, we hypothesised 
that the fungal microbiota might be altered in patients with PSC. 
To investigate this hypothesis, we analysed the fungal microbiota 
in a cohort of patients with PSC, including patients with and 
without IBD, in comparison with patients with IBD alone and 
with healthy subjects.
Study population and methods
Study population
Patients with PSC and/or IBD were recruited in the Hepatology 
and Gastroenterology Departments of Saint-Antoine Hospital, 
Paris, France. The diagnosis of PSC, including small-duct PSC, 
was established according to the guidelines of the European 
Association for the Study of the Liver.25 All patients with PSC 
included in the study underwent screening for IBD. IBD diagnosis was established according to clinical, radiological, endoscopic and histological criteria and only patients in remission 
were included. Remission status was attested by normal C-reactive protein concentration in serum and the absence of clinical symptoms, based on expert clinicians’ assessment. Exclusion 
criteria were the following: less than 18 years of age, secondary 
sclerosing cholangitis, decompensated cirrhosis, previous liver 
transplantation, active IBD or previous colon surgery, and intake 
of antibiotics or of colon-cleansing preparation within the last 
3months preceding stool collection. Healthy subjects were 
recruited via the healthy donor biobank of the Gastroenterology 
Department in Saint-Antoine Hospital. All recruited patients and 
healthy subjects provided written informed consent before stool 
donation. 
Collection of clinical data
Clinical data were collected by reviewing medical charts. The 
following data were recorded: the date of PSC diagnosis, the 
history of acute cholangitis and endoscopic treatment, the date 
of IBD diagnosis, IBD topography and medications for PSC or 
IBD. In patients with PSC, serum liver tests were performed at 
the time of stool collection and included alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), total 
serum bilirubin and serum albumin. In these patients, liver 
stiffness assessed by transient elastography at the time of stool 
collection ±12 months was recorded when available. Cirrhosis 
was defined histologically or by liver stiffness >14.4kPa.26
Stool collection and DNA extraction
Whole stools were collected in sterile boxes, immediately 
homogenised, and aliquots of 0.2g were frozen at −80°C for 
further analysis. DNA was extracted from the faecal samples, as 
described.22 Following microbial lysis by both mechanical and 
chemical methods, nucleic acids were precipitated in isopropanol for 10min at room temperature, incubated for 15min on 
ice and centrifuged for 30min at 20000g and 4°C. Pellets were 
suspended in 450µL of phosphate buffer and 50µL of potassium 
acetate. After RNase treatment and DNA precipitation, nucleic 
acids were recovered via centrifugation at 20000g and 4°C for 
30min. The DNA pellet was suspended in 80mL of trypsinEDTA buffer. DNA samples were then subjected to 16S and 
ITS2 sequencing for bacterial and fungal microbiota analyses, 
respectively.
16S and ITS2 DNA sequencing
Bacterial diversity in stools was determined by targeting a 
portion of the ribosomal genes in extracted DNA. A 16S 
DNA gene fragment comprising the V3 and V4 hypervariable 
regions (16S sense 5′-TACGGRAGGCAGCAG-3′ and antisense 5′-CTACCNGGGTATCTAAT-3′) was amplified using 
an optimised and standardised 16S amplicon library preparation protocol (Metabiote, GenoScreen). Briefly, 16S DNA PCR 
was performed using 5ng of genomic DNA according to the 
manufacturer’s protocol (Metabiote), 192 bar-coded primers 
(Metabiote MiSeq Primers) at final concentrations of 0.2 μmol/L 
and an annealing temperature of 50°C for 30 cycles. The PCR 
products were purified using an Agencourt AMPure XP-PCR 
purification system (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA), quantified according to the manufacturer’s protocol and multiplexed at 
equal concentrations. Sequencing was performed using a 300bp 
paired-end sequencing protocol on an Illumina MiSeq platform 
(Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) at GenoScreen, Lille, France. 
Raw paired-end reads were subjected to the following processes: 
(1) quality filtering using the PRINSEQ-lite PERL script,27 by 
truncating the bases from the 3′ end, that did not exhibit a 
quality <30, based on the Phred algorithm; (2) paired-end read 
assembly using fast length adjustment of short reads to improve 
genome assemblies,28 with a minimum overlap of 30 bases and 
a 97% overlap identity; and (3) searching for and removing 
both forward and reverse primer sequences using CutAdapt, 
with no mismatches allowed in the primer sequences. Assembled sequences, for which perfect forward and reverse primers 
were not found, were eliminated. A similar approach was used 
for fungi microbiota using the primers ITS2 (sense 5′-GTGARTCATCGAATCTTT-3′ and antisense 5′-GATATGCTTAAGTTCA
GCGGGT-3′) and the optimised and standardised ITS2 amplicon library preparation protocol (Metabiote, GenoScreen).
16S and ITS2 sequence analyses
The sequences were demultiplexed and quality filtered using 
the QIIME V.1.9.1 software package.29 The sequences were 
then assigned to operational taxonomic units (OTU) using the 
UCLUST algorithm with a 97% pairwise identity threshold 
and classified taxonomically using the Silva reference database 
(version 132) for bacteria and the UNITE ITS database (alpha 
version 12_11) for fungi.30 Rarefaction was performed (11000 
and 2900 sequences per sample for 16S and ITS2, respectively) 
and used to compare the relative abundance of OTUs across 
samples. Alpha diversity was estimated by the Shannon diversity index or the number of observed species. Beta diversity was 
measured by a Bray-Curtis distance matrix and was used to build 
principal coordinate analysis plots. Raw sequence data are accessible in the European Nucleotide Archive (accession number 
PRJEB30862).
Statistical analyses
Patients’ characteristics were expressed as median (range) 
and compared using Mann-Whitney or Χ2
 tests as appropriate. GraphPad Prism V.6.0 (San Diego, CA, USA) was used 
for analyses and graph preparation. Statistical analyses were 
performed using the two-tailed non-parametric Mann-Whitney

test or Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparison 
test. Statistical significance of sample grouping for beta diversity was performed using analysis of similarity method (9999 
permutations). Multivariate association test with linear models 
(MaAsLin), a multivariate statistical framework, was used 
to find associations between clinical metadata and microbial 
community abundance using default setting (p values <0.05 
with q values <0.25 were considered significant).31 Correlation 
networks were built using Spearman’s correlation or distance 
correlation tests,22 and figures were built using Cytoscape 
V.3.6.0. The p values were corrected using the Benjamini and 
Hochberg procedure to control for the false discovery rate. The 
relative connectedness of the networks was calculated as the ratio 
between the number of significant interactions (edges) and the 
number of taxa (nodes) in the network. In all statistical analyses, 
differences with p values <0.05 were considered significant.
Results
Characteristics of the study population
The study population included four groups: patients with PSC 
and no IBD (PSC_only, n=22), patients with PSC and IBD (PSC_
IBD, n=27), patients with IBD and no PSC (IBD_only, n=33) 
and healthy subjects (n=30). To limit the potential effects of 
active intestinal inflammation on gut microbiota, all patients 
with IBD included in the present study were in remission. Table 1
shows the study population’s characteristics. Patients with PSC 
are presented together and separately depending on whether 
they had or not concomitant IBD. A minority of patients with 
PSC had cirrhosis (approximately 10%) and none of them had 
decompensated cirrhosis. A large majority of patients with 
PSC (more than 90%) were treated with ursodeoxycholic acid 
(UDCA). The two groups of patients with PSC, that is, PSC_only 
and PSC_IBD, were comparable, notably in terms of age, gender, 
body mass index, UDCA treatment, PSC duration and severity, 
notably assessed by the Mayo risk score,32 liver stiffness and the 
presence or not of cirrhosis. The only significant difference was 
the prevalence of overlap syndrome (PSC associated with autoimmune hepatitis), which was diagnosed in four patients without 
IBD versus none of the patients with IBD. Likewise, the two 
groups of patients with IBD, that is, PSC_IBD and IBD_only, 
were comparable in terms of age, body mass index, IBD duration 
and phenotype, as well as 5-aminosalicylic acid and steroid treatments. However, patients with PSC_IBD were more frequently 
males and had more often extensive colitis (Montreal E3) than 
patients with IBD_only.
Bacterial dysbiosis in PSC
The bacterial fraction of the gut microbiota was analysed using 
16S sequencing. The analysis of beta diversity showed a clustering of samples according to the study group (figure 1A; online 
supplementary figure 1A,B). The difference observed in beta 
diversity was statistically significant between patients with IBD 
either alone or with PSC on the one hand and healthy subjects 
on the other. The difference between patients with PSC_IBD and 
those with IBD_only was also statistically significant, whereas 
the difference between patients with PSC_only and healthy 
subjects showed a trend towards significance (p=0.09). These 
results indicated that both IBD and PSC were linked to intestinal 
dysbiosis. Alpha diversity, assessed by the Shannon and Chao1 
indexes, was not significantly different between patients with 
IBD_only and healthy subjects, which could be explained by the 
fact that all patients with IBD were in remission. Yet, patients 
with PSC_IBD showed significantly lower alpha diversity than 
either patients with IBD_only or healthy subjects (figure 1B,C). 
This suggested that alterations in the gut bacterial microbiota 
diversity were aggravated when PSC was superimposed on 
IBD. In keeping with previous work, we found that in all study 
groups, the bacterial gut microbiota was dominated by bacteria 
from the Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria phyla (figure 2A) and from the Ruminococcaceae, 
Lachnospiraceae, Veillonellaceae, Rikenellaceae, Bifidobacteriaceae and Enterobacteriaceae families (figure 2B). We sought 
to determine if bacterial features were associated with disease 
phenotype, using a MaAsLin, to over-ride the effect of potential 
confounding factors such as age, gender, smoking or treatment. 
Associations between clinical features and microbiota bacteria 
thus found are shown in online Supplementary file 2. This analysis showed that the PSC status was associated with alterations 
in the abundance of several taxa, notably a decrease in members 
of the Firmicutes phylum, except for Veillonella the abundance 
of which was increased, and an increase in members of the 
Proteobacteria phylum (figure 2C; online Supplementary file 2). 
We also found negative correlations between the abundance of 
several bacteria OTUs (including the Alistipes, Blautia, Coprococcus and Roseburia genera and the Eubacterium hallii species) 
and serum liver tests (notably total bilirubinaemia) in patients 
with PSC (figure 2D). Furthermore, treatment with UDCA was 
found to be negatively associated with bacteria from the Sphingomonadaceae family (online Supplementary file 2). Bacterial 
taxa found to be associated with the IBD status are shown in 
online Supplementary file 3A.
Altered bacterial correlation network in PSC
Next, we built a bacterial abundance correlation network to 
evaluate the bacterial ecosystem structure. The detailed correlations between bacteria are reported in online Supplementary 
file 4. A rich and complex network of correlations between 
bacteria was observed in healthy controls (figure 3A, left 
upper panel). In comparison, the density of bacterial correlation network was decreased in patients with IBD_only and to 
an even greater extent, in patients with PSC, combined or not 
with IBD, as attested by a decreased relative connectedness and 
a lower number of neighbours (figure 3A,B). There was no statistically significant difference between PSC_only and PSC_IBD 
groups for these two parameters, but the network in PSC_IBD 
was smaller (nodes n=71) than in PSC_only (nodes n=128), 
suggesting a deleterious additive effect of PSC and IBD.
Fungal dysbiosis in PSC
Using ITS2 sequencing, we then assessed the composition of the 
fungal gut microbiota in the study population. The analysis of 
beta diversity showed a clustering of samples according to the 
study group (figure 4A; online Supplementary file 5A,B). Differences were statistically significant between healthy subjects and 
patients with either IBD_only or PSC_only, as well as between 
patients with PSC_IBD and patients with either IBD_only 
or PSC_only. The analysis of alpha diversity, assessed by the 
Shannon and Chao1 indexes, showed no significant difference 
between the four study groups (figure 4B; online Supplementary 
file 5C). However, globally taken, patients with PSC (ie, PSC_
only combined with PSC_IBD) displayed a significantly higher 
fungal diversity assessed by the Shannon index than patients with 
IBD_only and a trend (p=0.08) towards higher diversity than 
healthy subjects (figure 4C; online Supplementary file 5D). In 
all groups, the fungal microbiota was dominated by two phyla: 
Ascomycota and Basidiomycota (figure 4D). The most dominant

Gut microbiota
Figure 1 Biodiversity of the bacterial gut microbiota. The bacterial fraction of gut microbiota was analysed using 16S sequencing in healthy subjects 
and in patients with IBD_only, primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)_IBD or PSC_only. (A) Beta diversity was assessed by principal coordinate analysis 
of Bray-Curtis distance. PC1, PC2 and PC3 represent the top three principal coordinates that captured most of the diversity. The fraction of diversity 
captured by the coordinate is given as a percentage. Each sample is coloured according to the study group; analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) method 
was used for comparisons. Alpha diversity was estimated by (B) Shannon and (C) Chao1 indexes; Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparison 
test were used for comparisons. Means and SEM are indicated in panels (B) and (C). In all panels, *p<0.05; **p<0.01; ***p<0.001.
genera identified were: Saccharomyces, Debaryomyces, Candida,
Penicillium, Fusarium, Kluyveromyces, Exophiala, Alternaria
and Filobasidium (figure 4E). We then used MaAsLin to identify 
the fungi taxa potentially associated with the disease phenotype. 
After adjusting for confounding factors, we found that PSC was 
associated with increases in Exophiala genus and Sordariomycetes class (figure 4F). The increased abundance of Exophiala was 
particularly striking even if it was observed in only a few patients 
with PSC (figure 4F; online Supplementary file 5E). Conversely, 
PSC was associated with a decrease in the Saccharomycetales 
order, Saccharomycetes class, Saccharomycetaceae family and 
S. cerevisiae species (figure 4F; online Supplementary file 5F).

Gut microbiota
Figure 2 Composition of the bacterial gut microbiota. Global composition of bacterial microbiota at (A) the phylum and (B) family levels was 
determined in the four study groups (as defined in figure 1), and expressed as the relative abundance of operational taxonomic units (OTU) in each 
group. (C) Bacterial taxa associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) were identified using multivariate association test with linear models 
(MaAsLin) multivariate analysis. For each taxon, the fold change was calculated as the ratio of mean abundance between PSC cases and healthy 
subjects. (D) Correlations between bacterial OTUs and liver tests in patients with PSC were analysed. Only OTUs present in >50% of the samples were 
taken into account, and only significant correlations (p<0.05 after correction for the false discovery rate with Benjamini and Hochberg procedure) are 
shown. ALP, alkaline phosphatase; ALT, alanine aminotransferase; AST, aspartate aminotransferase; GGT, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase; ULN, upper

cohort of patients with IBD. The difference is explained by the 
absence of patients with active IBD in the present study, while in 
our previous study, we found that changes in fungi microbiota 
were mostly driven by active inflammation.22
Altered interkingdom network in PSC
To explore the equilibrium between fungi and bacteria diversity 
in the gut, we determined the fungi-to-bacteria diversity ratio. 
This ratio was significantly higher in patients with PSC_IBD 
than in those with IBD_only or in healthy subjects (figure 5A; 
online Supplementary file 6A). Likewise, when considered globally, patients with PSC had a higher ITS2/16S diversity ratio 
than patients with IBD_only (figure 5B; online Supplementary 
file 6B). No significant difference of the fungi-to-bacteria diversity ratio was observed between healthy subjects and patients 
with PSC_only (p=0.23 for Shannon) or all patients with 
PSC (p=0.11 for Shannon).
Next, we asked whether bacterial and fungi microbiota 
interactions were altered according to the disease phenotype. 
To address this question, we built an abundance correlation 
network at the family and genus level according to the study 
group. Detailed correlations between bacteria and fungi in each 
group are reported in online Supplementary file 7. The density 
of fungi-bacteria network was unchanged in patients with 
IBD_only, in comparison with healthy subjects (figure 5C,D). 
In PSC_only and PSC_IBD groups, the interkingdom network

Gut microbiota
Figure 3 Correlation networks of bacterial gut microbiota. Correlation networks between bacteria were built using Spearman correlation test in 
the four study groups (as defined in figure 1). (A) Abundance correlation networks are shown, in which each circle (node) represents an operational 
taxonomic unit (OTU), its colour, the bacterial phylum (blue, Firmicutes; green, Bacteroidetes; yellow, Actinobacteria; orange, Proteobacteria), and its 
size, the number of direct edges. Edges indicate the magnitude of distance correlation (positive in green, negative in red). Only OTUs present in >50% 
of the samples were taken into account, and only significant correlations (p<0.05 after correction for false discovery rate using Benjamini and 
Hochberg procedure) are shown. The table in the inset shows the networks' parameters. The relative connectedness of the networks was calculated 
as the ratio between the number of significant interactions (edges) and the number of taxa (nodes) in the network. (B) Number of neighbours; means

was disrupted, as illustrated by a decrease in the number of 
nodes and edges compared with the healthy or IBD_only groups 
(figure 5C,D; online Supplementary file 8). Indeed, the number 
of connected nodes in the largest connected network was lower 
in patients with PSC than in the other groups (50, 19, 11 and 
8 nodes in healthy subjects, IBD_only, PSC_IBD and PSC_only, 
respectively). Moreover, in PSC_only, the fungi-bacteria network 
appeared to be even scarcer than in PSC_IBD, with a significantly 
lower number of neighbours (figure 5D). These results indicated 
that PSC was associated with an alteration of the bacterial-fungi 
interactions.
Discussion
In this study, we showed that patients with PSC bore a bacterial gut dysbiosis and a fungal gut dysbiosis, compared with 
healthy subjects and patients with IBD_only. A bacterial faecal 
dysbiosis was previously reported in patients with PSC.10–19

Gut microbiota
Figure 4 Biodiversity and composition of the fungal gut microbiota. The fungal fraction of gut microbiota was analysed using ITS2 sequencing in 
the four study groups (as defined in figure 1). (A) Beta diversity was assessed by principal coordinate analysis of Bray-Curtis distance. PC1, PC2 and 
PC3 represent the top three principal coordinates that captured most of the diversity. The fraction of diversity captured by the coordinate is given 
as a percentage. Each sample is coloured according to the study group; analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) method was used for comparisons. Alpha 
diversity was estimated by the Shannon index (B) in the four study groups and (C) in all patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) (with or 
without IBD) in comparison with healthy subjects and patients with IBD_only; Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparison test were used for 
comparisons. Global composition of fungal microbiota at (D) the phylum and (E) genus levels was determined in the four study groups, and expressed 
as the relative abundance of operational taxonomic units (OTU) in each group. (F) Fungal taxa associated with PSC were identified using multivariate 
association test with linear models (MaAsLin) multivariate analysis. For each taxon, the fold change was calculated as the ratio of mean abundance 
between PSC cases and healthy subjects. Means and SEM are indicated in panels (B) and (C). In all panels, *p<0.05.
that bacterial microbiota is characterised by alterations in its 
biodiversity and composition in PSC. In keeping with previous 
reports,13 14 16 19 we found that PSC was associated with a specific 
bacterial microbiota signature, distinct from that associated with 
IBD. Our present results confirm previous findings regarding 
the altered composition of bacterial microbiota in patients with 
PSC such as the decreased proportion of Faecalibacterium and 
of Ruminococcus genera,14 and the increased proportion of 
Veillonella.
11 13–16 18 The consistently increased proportion of 
Veillonella found in several studies could suggest that Veillonella
is involved in PSC pathogenesis. However, the abundance of 
Veillonella is not specifically related to PSC and is more likely 
a marker of advanced liver disease.13 33 34 We found a negative 
correlation between Blautia abundance and serum bilirubin, as 
well as a decrease in the abundance of Blautia in the microbiota 
of patients with PSC, whereas Torres et al previously reported

Gut microbiota
Figure 5 Fungi-bacteria networks. To address the equilibrium between gut bacteria and fungi in the four study groups (as defined in figure 1), 
ITS2/16S diversity ratio was estimated by the Shannon index (A) in the four study groups and (B) in all patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis 
(PSC) (with or without IBD) in comparison with healthy subjects and patients with IBD_only; Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparison 
test were used for comparisons. (C) Correlation networks at the family and genus levels were built in the four groups using distance correlation 
test. Abundance correlation networks are shown, in which each node represents a family or a genus, its shape, the kingdom (square, fungi; circle, 
bacteria), its colour, the phylum (pink, Ascomycota; purple, Basidiomycota; blue, Firmicutes; green: Bacteroidetes; yellow, Actinobacteria; orange, 
Proteobacteria), and its size, the number of direct edges. Edges indicate the magnitude of distance correlation (positive in green, negative in red, 
according to Spearman test). Only family and genus present in >20% of the samples were taken into account, and only significant correlations 
(p<0.05 after correction for false discovery rate using Benjamini and Hochberg procedure) are shown. The table in the inset shows the networks' 
parameters. The relative connectedness of the networks was calculated as the ratio between the number of significant interactions (edges) and the

an increase.12 In this latter study, Torres et al used mucosal biopsies obtained during colonoscopy to analyse the gut microbiota, 
which can explain the discrepancy with our findings because 
of the drastic effects of colon-cleansing products administered 
before colonoscopy on gut microbiota. Indeed, more recently, 
Torres et al analysed the gut microbiota from stool samples 
instead of biopsies and like ourselves, found a decreased abundance of Blautia in patients with PSC.19
We also found correlations between several bacteria of the gut 
microbiota and liver tests in patients with PSC. The abundance 
of Alistipes was negatively correlated with the serum concentrations of ALT, ALP and GGT. This bacterium was previously

shown to be decreased in the gut microbiota of patients with 
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.35 The abundance of E. hallii was 
also negatively correlated with the serum concentrations of AST, 
ALP, GGT and total bilirubin. This bacterium is able to produce 
short-chain fatty acids (butyrate and propionate), which have 
anti-inflammatory properties.36 E. hallii was previously shown 
to be decreased in the gut microbiota of patients with IBD,37
and in a murine model of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.38 It 
was shown to improve insulin sensitivity in a murine model of 
diabetes,39 and there is evidence to indicate that this effect could 
also occur in patients with the metabolic syndrome.40 Most of 
the correlations we found between gut bacteria and liver tests 
were with bilirubinaemia, highlighting the strong link between 
cholestasis and bile acids on the one hand and gut microbiota 
on the other, as recently reported by Torres et al.19 It should 
be emphasised in this respect that bacteria and fungi are able 
to metabolise bile acids.41 Almost all patients with PSC included 
in this study were on UDCA treatment (94%), which may have 
influenced our results. UDCA has been shown to impact the 
intestinal microbiota in patients with IBD,42 or primary biliary 
cholangitis,43 but so far, no difference in bacterial gut microbiota 
has been found in patients with PSC, depending on whether 
or not they were treated with UDCA.13 19 We herein demonstrated that the network of correlations between gut bacteria was 
altered with a decreased number of correlations in patients with 
IBD and to an even greater extent in patients with PSC. These 
results suggest that the functions of the microbiota acting as a 
community in the gut may be disturbed in PSC.
For the first time in this study, we report the occurrence of 
fungal dysbiosis in patients with PSC. PSC-associated fungal 
dysbiosis was characterised by an increased biodiversity (alpha 
diversity) compared with healthy subjects or patients with IBD 
and by an altered composition, including notably a marked 
increase in the abundance of Exophiala genus in some patients. 
Exophiala is a fungi genus of the Herpotrichiellaceae family 
that has been involved in infections known as phaeohyphomycosis, particularly in immunocompromised hosts. Most of 
these infections affect the skin,44 but Exophiala can also cause 
systemic infections that involve the lungs or the central nervous 
system.44 Of particular interest, Oztas et al reported the case of 
a systemic infection by Exophiala dermatitidis mimicking PSC 
in a 24-year-old woman without immunodeficiency.45 Other 
investigators reported the case of an end-stage liver disease 
caused by E. dermatitidis and characterised by cholestasis and 
dilatation of intrahepatic bile ducts.46 Combined, these clinical 
observations and our results suggest that Exophiala could participate in the pathophysiology of PSC, at least in a subgroup of 
patients, a hypothesis that deserves to be tested in the future. In 
the microbiota of patients with PSC, we also found a decrease 
in the proportion of the Saccharomycetaceae family, including 
the species S. cerevisiae, which has been shown to be decreased 
in the microbiota of patients with IBD,22 and to have antiinflammatory properties.22 Future studies should also address 
the potential implication of S. cerevisiae in the occurrence or 
progression of PSC. Bacterial and fungal dysbiosis associated 
with PSC was different from that associated with IBD, which 
suggests a specificity of dysbiosis in PSC, distinct from that in 
IBD. The fungal microbiota of patients with PSC displayed an 
increased biodiversity and its correlation network with bacteria 
was disrupted, especially in patients with PSC_only. A disrupted 
correlation network between bacteria and fungi has been previously reported in patients with cirrhosis.21
Our study has some limitations: it is a monocentric study, the 
population size is relatively small and the design is observational. 
However, this work has also major strengths including homogeneous populations of patients with stable PSC and quiescent IBD 
and two groups of similar size for the comparison of patients with 
PSC, with and without IBD. The fact that patients were recruited 
in national reference centres for PSC and IBD is a strength as 
it ensures reliable diagnosis and rigorous phenotype for both 
diseases. However, patients followed in a reference centre may 
not be representative of the whole PSC population,1 3 which 
may also introduce a selection bias. Provided that our results are 
confirmed by others, one can envision using faecal microbiotabased biomarkers as a diagnostic tool in patients with suspected 
PSC. This type of strategy has already been proposed,13 16 18
notably by Iwasawa et al who recently reported a characteristic dysbiosis of the salivary microbiota in children with PSC.47
Furthermore, specific alterations of the gut microbiota found 
in PSC could be used to design new therapeutic strategies, as 
recently proposed for alcoholic liver disease.48
We conclude from this study that PSC is characterised by an 
altered fungal gut microbiota associated with an impaired fungibacteria correlation network. While their implications remain to 
be refined, the present findings pave the way for the development of microbiota-based biomarkers and treatment in PSC.
