Results of surgical treatment for extrahepatic biliary
atresia in United Kingdom 1980-2
Survey conducted on behalf of the British Paediatric Association Gastroenterology
Group and the British Association of Paediatric Surgeons

Abstract
A postal survey identified 114 infants with biliary atresia
(roughly one in 21 000 live births). Biliary operations
were performed on 107. Of the 105 infants who were
followed up, 35 were free of jaundice at 10 months to 31
years. Good results occurred most often in those operated
on by 12 weeks and were also related to the number of
cases operated on in each centre. Only two of 18 infants
treated in centres dealing with one case a year were free
of jaundice compared with 11 of38 at centres treating two
to five cases a year and 22 of 49 in a centre treating more
than five cases a year.
Jaundice in an infant of more than 2 weeks associated
with yellow urine or pale stools is never physiological
and requires urgent investigation to identify causes for
which effective treatment may be possible. Identification
of suspected cases by 4 weeks of age and a greater concentration of investigative and surgical skills should
improve the short term results of surgery and the long
term prognosis of biliary atresia.

hepatobiliary disease. Urgent investigation is essential to prevent
complications and to identify causes for which effective treatment may be available., Among these causes should now be
considered extrahepatic biliary atresia, a disorder in which
inflammatory destruction of the extrahepatic bile ducts is
rapidly followed by a biliary type cirrhosis. Such infants in the
first two months of life are often well nourished and have no
extrahepatic features of cirrhosis but in untreated cases have a
mean age at death of 11 months and a four year survival of
2%.2 3
Jaundice free survival after surgery for extrahepatic biliary
atresia of the "non-correctable" form-that is, in which there
is occlusion of the proximal portion of the extrahepatic bile
ducts in the porta hepatis-was first reported by Kasai and
Suzuki in 1959.' They excised the residual bile duct tissue,
exposing bile channels of 50-300 Sum in the porta hepatis at the
level of the liver capsule, and anastomosed the cut surface to a
Roux-en-Y loop of jejunum.5 By 1983 Kasai could report
41 jaundice free survivors (27% of treated patients) who were
well grown and normally active at ages ranging from 5 to 28
years, with 21 more than 10 years of age.' The radical surgical
procedure employed by Kasai gained acceptance slowly in
Japan, but by 1970 a national scheme of management of biliary
atresia had evolved.7 Such surgery has been accepted even more
slowly outside Japan, but in the past decade prolonged survival
without recurrence of jaundice has been reported in roughly
40% of cases from the United States," Australia,", Europe,10
and the United Kingdom1" by centres which have concentrated
resources on the management of this disorder. All reports have
emphasised the importance of early surgery, ideally by 60 days
of age and certainly by 90 days of age, in obtaining a satisfactory
bile flow. These studies also confirm that the pathology of
biliary artresia and the response to surgery are no different
from those observed in Japan.
The aim of this study was to ascertain the incidence of biliary
atresia in the United Kingdom over the three years 1980-2,
assess the short term results of surgical treatment, and determine the age at which surgery had been performed.

Methods
The data were obtained by a postal survey of members of the
British Paediatric Association Gastroenterology Group and the
British Association of Paediatric Surgeons, the survey having been
endorsed by these organisations. A member who reported cases was
identified in each area. A short questionnaire was sent asking for age
at surgery, findings at laparotomy, surgical procedure used, lowest
subsequent serum bilirubin concentration, presence or absence of
jaundice, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly, and results of the most
recent standard biochemical tests of liver function. Complications
were to be listed and the age at death recorded. Yearly reminders
seeking new cases were accompanied by a form on which follow up
data on identified cases were recorded. This report includes data on
children born between 1 January 1980 and 31 December 1982.
Results were analysed using the x2 test with Yates's continuity
correction factor.
Results
A.total of 114 cases of biliary atresia were reported. Two paediatric
surgeons were unable to cooperate in the study. Eight infants were
born outside the United Kingdom, giving an incidence of biliary
atresia of one in 21 000 to one in 23 000 live births in the United
Kingdom (number of births reported to the Office of Population
Censuses and Surveys). Seven infants did not have biliary surgery
owing to decompensated cirrhosis or congenital anomalies in other
systems-for example, cyanotic heart disease. Table I shows the
operations performed and the state of the infants at most recent follow
up.

Ninety five patients (83%) were treated by Kasai portoenterostomy
or a variant, and 12 underwent a conventional anastomosis between
residual elements of the bile ducts and bowel-for example, hepaticojejunostomy. The age at surgery ranged from 4 to 36 weeks (median
9-0, mean 10-7 (SD 5 5) weeks). Thirty five children were free of
jaundice at ages ranging from 10 months to 31 years (mean 2 years
3 months (SD 10 months)). Of 27 children operated on between
4 and 7 weeks, 10 (37%) were free of jaundice, as were 18 of 48
(38%) operated on between 8 and 11 weeks; only seven of 30 (23%)
operated on after 11 weeks were jaundice free. These differences
were not statistically significant.
The 114 patients were treated in 16 different centres by at least
16 different surgeons. The centres were divided into three groups to
assess whether the outcome of treatment was influenced by the
number of cases seen. Group A centres treated one case a year,
group B two to five cases a year, and group C more than five cases a
year (table II).
BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL VOLUME 290 2 FEBRUARY 1985
Nineteen infants were reported from centres in group A, and two
of 18 (11%) who underwent surgery were free of jaundice. In group B
38 of 41 had surgery, and in 11 (29%) this was successful. Surgery
was performed in 51 of 54 infants in the single centre of group C;
two were lost to follow up but 22 (43%) were jaundice free. The
difference in jaundice free survival rate between this last centre and
centres treating only one case a year was statistically significant
(p <0-05; X2 test). The mean ages at surgery in the three categories
of centres were: group A 8-4 (SD 4-7) weeks, group B 97 (3-1)
weeks, and group C 12-2 (6 9) weeks. Jaundice free survival in group A
centres occurred in one of nine children operated on at less than
8 weeks of age, one of six operated on at 8-11 weeks of age, and
none of three operated on later. Jaundice free survivals in group B
centres at the same age intervals were one of seven, nine of 22, and
one of nine, and in the group C centre eight of 11, eight of 20, and
six of 18.
The record of complications in the 64 survivors was incomplete,
but at least 12 had cholangitis and 21 presumed cholangitis. None
bled from oesophageal varices. Fluid loss from a cutaneous stoma
caused death in one child and profound shock in another. Prolapse
of the jejunum required surgical correction in another child. Four
were reported to have bled from their stoma. Rickets was reported
in 12 infants.
Discussion
The incidence of biliary atresia found in this survey (roughly
0-5/10 000 live births) was lower than in other series (0-8-
1-0/10 000 live births),12-" suggesting a degree of underreporting. Furthermore, infants with biliary atresia in the United
Kingdom may not necessarily have been managed by paediatricians or surgeons affiliated to either reporting group. Nevertheless, the magnitude of the problem created by extrahepatic
biliary atresia, with an incidence comparable to that of phenylketonuria,15 is confirmed.
In this study the various surgical procedures utilised indicate
that Kasai's radical surgical approach to biliary atresia has been
adopted by most paediatric surgeons in Britain who are dealing
with this problem. Portoenterostomy, portogastrostomy, or
portocholecystostomy had been performed in 94 (88%) of the
107 infants in whom bile drainage procedures were attempted.
The overall results of surgery with a jaundice free survival
rate of 33% suggest that the pathology of biliary artresia and its
response to surgery are no different in the United Kingdom
from those in other parts of the world.8-10
Infants who underwent surgery at centres seeing only one
case a year were significantly less likely to have a successful
outcome than those having treatment in a centre operating on
more than five cases a year, while the outcome in centres
treating two to five cases a year was intermediate. This study,
based on a very simple questionnaire, could not identify the
pathological factors or aspects of preoperative, intraoperative,
or postoperative management that might have contributed to
this difference in outcome. Nevertheless, in view of the radical
and unorthodox nature of the surgery of biliary atresia and the
fact that most major surgical procedures have a learning period
in which results are less than optimal, probably the experience
of the surgeon and the standard of perioperative care were
major factors.
The age at which surgery was performed was similar in all
centres and therefore did not account for the observed differences in outcome. In the group as a whole, however, the
incidence of successful surgery fell with increasing age at the
time of operation, but the effect of age did not reach statistical
significance. A similar trend was observed in a survey of cases
in North America with survival rates being higher when surgery
was performed before 90 days of age."' The influence of age at
surgery on outcome is more clearly seen in series reporting the
experience of one surgeon. In a recent report from Kasai's
unit 27 of 33 infants (82%) operated on at less than 60 days of
age had good bile flow, as compared with 26 of 47 (55%)
operated on between 61 and 90 days and five of 13 (38%)

operated on later.6 In the single centre in our series treating
more than five cases a year the jaundice free survival rate with
surgery before 8 weeks was 72% compared with 33% after
12 weeks. In this series three quarters of the infants were
treated after 60 days of age and one third after 90 days.
These observations and the progressive nature of biliary
atresia as evidenced by pathological studies17 18 suggest that if
more infants are to benefit from treatment they must have
surgery by 8 weeks of age. This will be possible only if suspected cases are identified earlier and referred to centres with
the diagnostic skills to distinguish biliary atresia from the many
intrahepatic causes of complete cholestasis, conditions for which
surgery is contraindicated.19 Observations at King's College
Hospital suggest that the major cause of delay in diagnosis is a
failure to appreciate the importance of jaundice in infancy,
particularly in a well grown, healthy looking baby. Parents
should be advised that any jaundice persisting into the third
week of life is unusual and requires referral to a paediatrician
for investigation and possible treatment.
Family and community physicians, health visitors, and district
nurses need reminding that persistently yellow or orange urine
or stools with reduced pigment accompanying jaundice invariably indicates hepatobiliary disease, which in infants
requires urgent investigation. Paediatric referral is often not
initiated until review in the infant clinic at 6 weeks of age. If
this examination was advanced to 4 weeks of age earlier treatment would be possible. At 4 weeks of age detection of other
structural abnormalities and assessment of developmental or
nutritional problems and of emotional difficulties in the childparent interaction-the main objectives of the examinationshould be no more difficult than at 6 w,eeks of age. In Japan infant
review is at 1 month of age and the investigation of suspected
biliary atresia has been concentrated in a few centres, in each
of which the vast majority of operations are done by one
surgeon.7 This survey suggests that a similar approach in the
United Kingdom would increase the number of infants who
become free of jaundice after surgery and may improve the
long term prognosis in biliary atresia.

Use of anti-inflammatory drugs by patients admitted with
small or large bowel perforations and haemorrhage
M J S LANGMAN, LINDA MORGAN, ANNE WORRALL
Abstract
The intake of anti-inflammatory drugs by 268 patients
with colonic or small bowel perforation or haemorrhage
was compared with that by a group of patients, matched
for age and sex, with uncomplicated lower bowel disease.
Patients with perforation or haemorrhage were more
than twice as likely to be takers of anti-inflammatory
drugs, but no association was detected with the intake
of other types of drugs, particularly cardiovascular
drugs.

The association between complicated lower bowel
disease and intake of anti-inflammatory drugs may be
causal.
Introduction
The causes of perforation of the gut below the duodenum,
except perforation occurring in association with ischaemia, are
poorly understood. Slow release enteric coated potassium
supplements are known to cause solitary ulcers in the lower
small intestine,' and it has recently been suggested that the
controlled release indomethacm preparation Osmosin may be
particularly likely to cause perforation of the lower bowel.2
Whether other pharmaceutical preparations of non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs can damage the lower bowel wall is
unknown, although anecdotal reports suggest that they may,3-5
and no general search has been made to determine if the use of
potassium supplements in general or of other cardiovascular
drugs is associated with intestinal damage. We therefore
examined the drug histories of patients admitted to hospital
