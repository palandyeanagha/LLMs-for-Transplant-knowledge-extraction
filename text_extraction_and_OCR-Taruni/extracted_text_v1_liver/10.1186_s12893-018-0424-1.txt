Abstract
Background: The indication for hepatic resection (HR) in patients suffering from liver metastases (LM) other than
colorectal and neuroendocrine tumors is one focus of current multidisciplinary, oncologic considerations. This study
retrospectively analyzes outcome after HR for non-colorectal, non-neuroendocrine (NCNNE) LM in the absence of
distant or extrahepatic metastases.
Methods: We included 100 consecutive patients undergoing HR for isolated NCNNE LM from a prospective database
in our institution, including postoperative follow-up. Primary tumors were of mesodermal origin in 44%, of ectodermal
origin in 29% and of entodermal origin in 27%. Survival analysis was performed by univariate and multivariable
methods. Mean follow-up after hepatic surgery was 3.6 years (0.25–16).
Results: Median age at the time of HR was 59.5 years. Kaplan-Meier-estimated survival after liver resection was 56.
8%, 34.3% and 24.5% after 5, 10 and 15 years, respectively. Univariate analysis after HR revealed residual disease (hepatic
or primary; p = 0.02), female gender (p = 0.013), entodermal origin (p = 0.009) and early onset of metastatic disease
(≤24 months, p = 0.002), as negative prognostic factors. Multivariable survival analysis confirmed residual disease,
female gender, entodermal embryologic origin and early onset of metastatic disease (≤24 months) as independent
negative prognostic factors.
Conclusion: Overall outcome after HR of NCNNE LM results in acceptable long-term outcome. Although individual
decision-making today mostly relies on clinical experience for this type of disease, risk factors derived from the
embryologic origin of the tumor might help in patient selection.

Background
Hepatic resection has become a standardized, well-established surgical procedure with low morbidity and mortality. Owing to growing experience in hepatobiliary
surgery, better understanding of tumor biology, effective
pharmaco- and other multidisciplinary therapies, the
therapeutic approach in metastatic colorectal carcinoma
(mCRC) has completely changed during the last two decades [1–3].
In CRC, large studies elucidated a survival benefit after
liver resection for hepatic metastases with a 5-year overall survival of up to 74% [3]. Current evidence shows a
benefit for resection of hepatic metastases in CRC independent of number or size, as long as complete tumor
clearance can be accomplished [4]. Likewise, surgical
treatment of metastases from neuroendocrine tumors
(NET) has emerged over recent years [5, 6]. In contrast to CRC, cytoreductive surgery for symptomatic
hormone-active metastases has also become an accepted treatment for NET [7–9].
In addition, surgically-unresectable NET LM are frequently treated by other local approaches such as arterial
embolization, thermo ablation, selective internal radiotherapy (SIRT) and liver transplantation [10].
As a consequence, a growing number of well-selected
patients undergo hepatic resection for NCNNE LM,
preferably after discussion in interdisciplinary tumor
boards [11]. However, substantial evidence for the benefit of such surgical treatment is still unavailable, partially
due to the relatively small number of patients being
resected with NCNNE LM compared to CRC or NET.
Also, an inherent heterogeneity of the arbitrarily defined
NCNNE groups has most probably led to the conflicting
results available today from case series [11–14]. Selecting surgical candidates for NCNNE LM resection at
present is based more on clinical decision- making for
individual patients following surgical criteria than on
oncological selection criteria.
While various risk factors and also prognostic factors have been identified [11, 12, 15–17], none of
those factors could be unanimously reproduced by
different centers.
The aim of the present study was to describe estimated Kaplan-Meier survival after HR for NCNNE liver
metastases only and to identify prognostic factors for
long-term survival in 100 patients after HR in a single
academic hepatobiliary surgical center.
Methods
Criteria for study inclusion
Our prospective liver database was analyzed from first
HR in NCNNE metastases performed from 1999 until
2015. In order to achieve a uniform data set, distinct exclusion criteria were applied: Patients with extrahepatic
disease (EHD) (except synchronous primary tumor specimen or lymph node involvement in the hepatoduodenal ligament), extra-abdominal tumor manifestation,
patients who underwent surgery for palliative causes and
incomplete (prior) resection of the primary or other
widespread extrahepatic tumor (resulting in R2 resections/debulking) were excluded from this analysis.
Concomitant peritonectomy and multivisceral resections were also excluded from further analysis.
Patients who had simultaneous resection of liver metastases and the primary tumor, however, were included in this study (Fig. 1).
Lymph node involvement extending to the hepatoduodenal ligament was considered as local metastatic
disease as long as affection was restricted to lymph
nodes number 12 a, 12 b and 12p according to the
Japanese classification [18] and these patients were
also included. Direct organ involvement by liver metastases
per continuitatem (i.e. contact with diaphragm, colon,
omentum etc.) was not defined as extrahepatic disease
(EHD) and therefore not considered as an exclusion
criterion, as long as complete resection was achieved.
Surgical technique
All HR were performed by one team of experienced
hepatobiliary surgeons. A Cavitron Ultrasonic Surgical
Aspirator (CUSA; Plainsboro, New Jersey, USA) in conjunction with bipolar (irrigated) forceps was used in all
resections. Hepatic and overall resection margins were
defined to be “negative” (R0) if at least “one cell layer” of
healthy tissue was present at the specimen (submillimeter definition).
Subgroups and definitions
For further analysis, cases were grouped according to
clinical, pathological and also embryological aspects of
the primary tumor. Factors were also retrieved to calculate a score proposed by Adam et al. [11]. This score is
derived from a retrospective pooled multicenter data
analysis and consists of 0–10 points. Factors included
are extrahepatic metastases (1 point), major hepatectomy (1 point), R2 resection (1 point), age (max. 2
points), disease-free interval between treatment of primary
(max. 2 points), primary tumor histology (max. 3 points).
Data acquisition and statistics
All patient-related perioperative data were extracted
from our prospectively- maintained hepatic surgery
database. Further data were retrieved from the electronic
patient charts at our institution. Survival status was continuously obtained at 3- month intervals from the institutional registry at our comprehensive cancer center
which is based on the local authority registration office
and/or from the computerized hospital information
Holzner et al. BMC Surgery (2018) 18:89 Page 2 of 9

system (e.g. if death occurred in-hospital). Estimated survival from the time of first HR was analyzed using the
Kaplan–Meier method, followed by a log-rank test for
the comparison of subgroups. Multivariable survival analysis was performed with the Cox proportional hazard
model (forward selection strategy using a likelihood ratio
statistic; inclusion p-value = 0.1) including the report of
relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence interval.
All data analyses were performed using SPSS (IBM
SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 23.0. Armonk,
NY; IBM Corp.).
Results
Study population
Between 1999 and 2015, 183 patients underwent HR for
NCNNE LM in our institution. A total of 100 patients
met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final
analysis (Fig. 1).
Demographics
The median age at the time of surgery was 59.5 years
(range 26–79). Half of the patients were aged 30–60
(50%), and 49 patients (49%) were older than 60 years.
Only one patient was younger than 30 years. Women
represented 60% of patients.
Mean follow-up after hepatic surgery was 3.6 years
(0.25–16).
Histology of the resected liver metastasis showed 58%
adenocarcinomas, 14% melanomas, 12% gastrointestinal
stroma tumors (GIST), 12% (soft tissue) sarcomas, 1%
squamous cell carcinomas and 3%, with primary histology
missing. Classification was based on the site of previous
surgical tumor removal and the histology of the removed
liver lesion, therefore termed “ill-defined”). Mesodermal,
ectodermal and entodermal origin was found in 44, 29
and 27%, respectively. 3 “ill-defined” primary tumors (with
missing primary histology) were placed in the entodermal
group based on the site of surgical primary removal. The
specific primary tumor sites (regardless of histological appearance) are given in Table 1.
Univariate survival
In the entire group of 100 patients, overall survival at 5,
10 and 15 years after liver resection for NCNNE-LM was
56.8%, 34.3% and 25%, respectively (Fig. 2). Univariately,
10 patients with residual tumor (7 at the hepatic margin, 2
at the site of the primary tumor and 1 the hepatoduodenal
ligament) showed a significantly lower estimated survival
compared to 90 patients with no residual disease (p = 0.02,
Fig. 3). Women were also shown to have poorer survival
(25.7 vs. 51% at 10 years, p = 0.013, Fig. 4). There was no
statistical difference between female gender specific tumors at 10 years (n = 30, e.g. breast, 30.6 vs. 37.2%) and
others (p = 0.659).

Based on histology, there was no statistically-significant
difference between adenocarcinomas, melanomas, GIST
and sarcomas (p = 0.061). Nevertheless, GIST showed best
5- and 10-year estimated survival among all entities included in this series (90 and 77.1%, respectively).
Anatomical classification according to primary tumor
origin by organ (e.g. gastrointestinal vs. genitourinary including subgroups, uveal vs. skin-derived melanoma) did
not provide interpretable results in estimated survival
differences (data not shown).
Stratification by embryologic origin revealed best survival in patients with tumors arising from the mesoderm
(66.6 and 41% estimated survival at 5 and 10 years,
p = 0.009) compared to ecto- and entodermal tumor
origin (Fig. 5).
Early onset metastatic disease as defined by diagnosis
≤24 months after primary tumor resection proved to be
a strong prognostic factor (19.8 vs. 44.1% 10-year estimated survival compared to late onset metastatic disease
(> 24 months, Fig. 6). The same was not true for synchronous (n = 20) or metachronous metastases (n = 80)
if stratified by 6 months vs. later than 6 months (p =
0.147).
Other single factors from the Adam score (age, major
liver resections and histology as shown above and for instance number and size of liver metastases resected did
not significantly influence survival in our series (data not
shown). A summary of the results is given in Table 2.
Multivariable survival analysis
Multivariable (Cox) analysis of survival revealed that residual tumor was the strongest independent negative
prognostic factor after resection of NCNNE LM (relative

risk (RR) 4.2). Further independent negative prognostic
factors were female gender (across all primary tumors)
(RR 2.5), entodermal origin of the primary tumor (RR
2.5) compared to mesodermal origin, which has been set
as the reference (RR 1) and early onset of metastatic disease ≤24 months (RR 2.7) (Fig. 7).
Discussion
Today, only a few series exceeding 50 or 100 patients
have been published shedding more light on future
clinical decision-making by retrospectively analyzing
outcomes [14–17, 19–24]. Adam et al. have published a
paramount multicenter series in 2006, including 1452
patients with NCNNE from 1983 until 2004 [11]. Based
on their collective, they have also developed a risk model
in an attempt to predict long-time survival. Their score
is based on the factors extrahepatic disease (EHD),
major hepatectomy, incomplete (R2) resection, patient
age, tumor histology and disease-free interval [11]. Hoffmann et al. demonstrated the applicability of this score
Fig. 3 Resection status no residual vs. residual tumor
Fig. 4 Male vs. Female Gender
Holzner et al. BMC Surgery (2018) 18:89 Page 5 of 9

in their own series [17]. Our study failed to reproduce
those results presumably for two reasons. First, the
Adam score was not applicable to the full extent here,
because we have purposely excluded extrahepatic/
extra-abdominal disease. Second, the proportion of
tumor entities in the Adam series differs from our study
population. Reason for this could be the rather large proportion of patients with melanoma as the primary tumor
in our series (“worst” Adam score, 3 points, 14% vs. 7%
Adam et al.) and the considerably smaller proportion of
patients with breast cancer (“best” Adam score, 0
points,15% vs. 31% Adam et al.) [11]. Therefore, universal
application of this score might be difficult and might indirectly correlate with the proportion of patients included
in the inaugural paper. The group at the Memorial Sloan
Kettering Cancer Center emphasize that hepatic resection
in the setting of NCNNE clearly plays a role in multimodal therapy, but most likely is not per se a curative

attempt [25]. The proportion of patients with EHD was
around 30% in the studies cited by Tan et al., whereas
again EHD in our series was specifically excluded. Hence,
to strive for complete R0 resection as a “curative” attempt
seems to be associated with prolonged survival in our
series. Either way, Adam et al. estimate only 1–10% of patients with hepatic metastases from NCNNE tumors to be
candidates for liver surgery [11].
This study focused on individual prognostic factors rather than including them in a score. With the exclusion
of patients with extrahepatic or extra-abdominal disease,
“curative” intent surgery was regarded as one mainstay
of patient selection. This approach is supported by the
result that residual disease has been shown to be the
strongest predictive factor with an RR of 4.2 with regard
to long-term survival. Even after adjusting for female
specific tumors (30%, i.e. breast, ovarian, uterine, fallopian tube), female gender seems to have a negative
prognostic impact in our series (RR 2.5). There is no
conclusive explanation for this finding, especially after
results from the largest series did not confirm this
gender-specific difference on multivariable analysis.
Therefore, we do not recommend precluding females or
female gender- specific tumors from surgical therapy.
There has been a debate on how to define metachronous disease in NCNNE patients. Clearly, as shown by
Adam et al., the “6 months rule” applied in CRC LM
seems to fall short of being able to stratify patients with
NCNNE. Metachronous (or late onset) metastatic disease heralds a potentially longer survival due to “slower”
progression over time. Hoffmann et al. analyzed 150 patients using a cutoff of 24 months for “late onset” metastatic disease and were able to show metachronous
disease to be associated with significantly longer survival
on multivariate analysis [17]. It is of note that all survival
data assessed in our study are calculated from the time
of liver resection. We feel that this is particularly important in a “curative attempt” setting, because it takes into
account that many patients with the diagnosis of
NCNNE LM are not immediately referred to a surgeon.
On the other hand, we could show that simultaneous resections of synchronous disease in select cases are not
futile and can also yield long-term survival. It has to be
stated that, on average, these patients are rare in our
clinical setting. Probably owing to fact that synchronous
LM from NCNNE are regarded as being “incurable” and
therefore surgically “untreatable” by many teams. In conclusion, a “test of time” approach with a cutoff of
24 months to HR in NCNNE LM is probably helpful to
select the best candidates, but not required per se for
the indication of surgery.
Some insight into the highly varying results with regard
to “tumor biology” might come from the comparison of
the embryologic origin of the NCNNE LM primary tumor.
This discussion has been fueled by findings addressing the
right or left-sided location of the CRC primary tumor as
an embryologically-driven potential key factor in survival
[26]. Unfortunately, embryologic stratification alone does
not eliminate overlap of groups with regard to e.g. the
gender or the histologic classification of the primary. On
multivariable analysis (with mesodermal origin defined as
an RR of 1) entodermal origin was associated with poorer
survival (RR 2.5). Ectodermal origin does seem to fall between the two other groups, and did not show any statistically- significant survival difference compared to either
group. In summary, tumors from mesodermal origin, especially GIST, seem to have the most favorable long-term
survival across a wide selection of published series [27,
28]. Therefore, some authors even advocate the exclusion
of GIST from pooled NCNNE analyses in the future.
These tumors have also been termed “non-sarcoma” liver
metastases [16, 22].

There are several shortcomings in a retrospective
study like this. Apart from clinically- based decision
making in selecting patients over a time span of more
than 15 years, there seem to be large differences between
centers with regard to the proportion of patients sent for
surgical evaluation and the timing of referral. Extrahepatic/extra-abdominal disease is also quite common in
patients with NCNNE LM. Excluding them from analysis was done to achieve a homogeneous group. It does
not reflect a policy to offer them no surgical treatment.
We point out that at this point all negative predictive
factors we found in this study are still not exclusion criterion for surgery at our center as long as “curative attempt surgery” can be planned.
Conclusion
Hepatectomy for isolated NCNNE LM in well-selected
patients is a feasible approach and results in a 5-year estimated survival after LR of 57% (including a 10-year
and 15-year survival rate: 34% and 25%, respectively).
Negative surgical margins, male gender, mesodermal origin of the primary and late onset metastatic disease (>
24 months) after therapy of the primary malignancy have
proven to be robust positive prognostic factors in this
study. In the absence of unanimously-reproducible
established prognostic factors, individual decision-making in multidisciplinary discussion teams seems indispensable. Multicenter or prospective registry analysis of
NCNNE-LM with regard to embryologic origin of the
primary could provide more conclusive results, hopefully
improving patient selection.
