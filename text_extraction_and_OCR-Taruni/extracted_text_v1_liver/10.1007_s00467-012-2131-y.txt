Abstract
Background Mutations in complement factor H (CFH), factor
I (CFI), factor B (CFB), thrombomodulin (THBD), C3 and
membrane cofactor protein (MCP), and autoantibodies against
factor H (αFH) with or without a homozygous deletion in
CFH-related protein 1 and 3 (ΔCFHR1/3) predispose development of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS).
Methods Different mutations in genes encoding complement
proteins in 45 pediatric aHUS patients were retrospectively
linked with clinical features, treatment, and outcome.
Results In 47% of the study participants, potentially pathogenic genetic anomalies were found (5xCFH, 4xMCP, and
4xC3, 3xCFI, 2xCFB, 6xαFH, of which five had ΔCFHR1/
3); four patients carried combined genetic defects or a mutation, together with αFH. In the majority (87%), disease onset
was preceeded by a triggering event; in 25% of cases diarrhea
was the presenting symptom. More than 50% had normal
serum C3 levels at presentation. Relapses were seen in half
of the patients, and there was renal graft failure in all except
one case following transplant.
Conclusions Performing adequate DNA analysis is essential
for treatment and positive outcome in children with aHUS.
The impact of intensive initial therapy and renal replacement
therapy, as well as the high risk of recurrence of aHUS in renal

Introduction
Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is a rare disease characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia,
and acute renal failure secondary to thrombotic microangiopathy [1]. It is distinguished from typical or Shigatoxinproducing Escherichia coli (STEC) HUS by the absence of
STEC infection. In recent years, aHUS has been found to be
associated with complement alternative pathway dysregulation. In almost 60% of aHUS patients, mutations in genes
encoding complement-regulating proteins are reported [2,
3]. Aside from mutations in these genes, aHUS has also
been reported in cobalamin C (cblC) disease caused by
mutations in the cblC MMACHC gene [4].
With respect to complement-regulating proteins, most
mutations are seen in factor H (CFH) [3, 5, 6], but mutations
in membrane cofactor protein (MCP or CD46) [3, 5–9] and
factor I (CFI) [3, 5, 6, 9–11] are also known to predispose
development of aHUS. Additionally, gain-of-function mutations in factor B (CFB) [6, 12, 13] and complement C3 (C3)
are reported [6, 14]. Some patients have combined mutations. Functional CFH deficiency due to autoantibodies
against CFH (αFH) have recently been described, which is
highly associated with a polymorphic homozygous deletion
of genes encoding CFH-related protein 1 and 3 (ΔCFHR1/3)
[15–18]. Finally, mutations in the thrombomodulin gene
(THBD), encoding membrane-bound thrombomodulin that
modulates complement activation on cell surfaces, have
been reported in aHUS [19]. Genetic complement anomalies
are thought to be risk factors rather than the only cause of
the disease, as patient relatives with the same mutation do
not always exhibit disease activity. AHUS represents approximately 10% of pediatric HUS cases. More than 80%
of cases are sporadic [2], with a better prognosis overall
than familial cases, which have a higher mutation rate [6].
Knowledge about the impact of mutations in complementregulating genes upon disease characteristics, response to
treatment, and outcome in pediatric aHUS patients could
help define therapeutic guidelines and be of prognostic
value. Therefore, the aim of this study was to: (1) document the frequency of known genetic complement abnormalities in a cohort of Dutch and Belgian children
diagnosed with aHUS, and (2) describe and compare disease characteristics, treatment, and clinical outcome of
these children.
Methods
Study population
From 2001 to 2010, genomic DNA was analyzed for genetic
disorders in complement-regulating genes (CFH, CFI, MCP,
CFB, C3, THBD, and ΔCFHR1/3 with αFH) in 45 Dutch
and Belgian pediatric patients diagnosed with aHUS by
pediatric nephrologists at six university medical centers in
The Netherlands and one in Belgium. Diagnosis of aHUS
was based on the following findings: hemolytic anemia
characterized by a hemoglobin (Hb) level <10 g/dl, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count <150 x 109
/l, elevated
levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and a negative
Coombs test, all in association with acute renal impairment.
Patients with STEC HUS were excluded by stool cultures,
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Shiga toxin, and/or
serologic antibodies against LPS O157. Genetic analyses
were combined with retrospectively obtained information
about patient clinical presentation, received treatment, and
outcome. Genetic analysis of 25 of these 45 patients has
been published before in a cohort of adults and children by
Westra et al. [9]. Patients in that and this study are indicated
in the authors’ earlier study [9] by the following numbers 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 9,15, 16, 18, 21, 24, 33, 36, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44,
45, 46, 48, 54, 58, 62. When two or more members of the
same family were affected by the disease at least 6 months
apart, it was considered as familial aHUS. Sporadic aHUS
patients had no family history of the disease. Complete
remission was defined by normalization of hematologic
parameters (Hb >10 g/dl, thrombocytes >150x109
/l, LDH
<450U/l) and renal function [glomerular filtration rate
(GFR) >80 ml/min/1.73 m2
, no proteinuria]. In patients with
partial remission, hematologic normalization was seen, but
with renal sequelae (GFR <80 ml/min/1.73 m2 and/or proteinuria and/or hypertension). The presence of proteinuria
was defined as >0.2 g/24 h or positive dipstick for proteins.
Hypertension was defined as a consistent blood pressure
>p95 for age and length. Recurrence was reported when a
new episode of aHUS presented >4 weeks after remission.
Chronic treatment was defined by the use of dialysis or
plasma therapy for >3 months. The average follow-up time
was 7.5 years, varying from two weeks in one patient
previously diagnosed and still hospitalized at time of inclusion, to 17 years in one patient who reached adulthood.
Permission to study DNA material was given by all patients
and/or their parents.
Genetic analysis of genes encoding CFH, CFI, MCP, C3,
CFB, and THBD
Genomic DNA was amplified for CFH [National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) RefSeq NM_000186.3],
1284 Pediatr Nephrol (2012) 27:1283–1291

CFI (NM_000204.3), MCP (NM_002389.3), C3
(NM_000064.2), CFB (NM_001710.4), and THBD
(NM_000361.2) by means of PCR. Primer data are available
upon request. Fragments included DNA sequences of the
individual exons and the splice donor and acceptor site.
Amplimers were subjected to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)
sequence analysis on an ABI 3130 xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Sequence analysis was performed using
Sequencher 4.8 software. Detected genetic aberrations were
confirmed on a second PCR product. Genomic DNA from
>100 healthy ethnically matched control individuals was used
to confirm sequence variations that might be potentially pathogenic. Potential pathogenicity of genetic alterations was further checked in the literature, evolutionary conservation, and
in silico prediction programs (Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant [SIFT; http://sift.jcvi.org/] and Polymorphism Phenotyping v2 [PolyPhen-2; http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2/]).
For evolutionary conservation, the 17-way vertebrate alignment from the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC)
Genome Browser (http://genome.ucsc.edu) was used.
Autoantibodies against factor H (αFH) and homozygous
deletion of CFHR1 and CFHR3 genes
Serum samples were tested for the presence of αFH by
means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA),
as described previously [20]. A positive control sample
was kindly obtained via Dr. Dragon-Durey (Paris, France).
Test results were considered positive if they were above
twice the standard deviation (SD) calculated from controls,
and samples were tested at least three times independently,
as described by Dragon-Durey et al. [15]. Homozygous
deletion of CFHR1 and CFHR3 was identified as described
previously [9]. In short, genomic DNA was amplified by
PCR using specific primers located in a 100-kb region
downstream of CFH. Amplification of one of the fragments
failed in case of ΔCFHR1/3. This method does not detect a
heterozygous deletion of the two genes or the presence of a
hybrid CFH/CFHR1 gene.
Results
Patients
Data on CFH, CFI, MCP, CFB, and C3 mutation characteristics are reported in Table 1. Data on patient characteristics
at presentation, treatment, and clinical outcome for each
type of mutation are reported in Tables 2, 3, 4. Due to the
small number of patients per mutated complement protein,
data were analyzed descriptively without statistical comparisons. Clinical data on the four patients with a combined
mutation or a mutation in combination with a homozygous
deletion in CFHR1/3 and αFH are given in Table 5. Forty-five
patients diagnosed with aHUS from six different university
medical centers in The Netherlands and one in Belgium were
included. Approximately as many males as females were
included in this study.
Genetic anomalies
In 20 of the 45 patients (44%) heterozygous mutations in
complement regulating genes and/or autoantibodies against
CFH were found, all but one with a homozygous deletion in
CFHR1/3 (Table 1). Five patients (overall 11%) carried a
mutation in CFH, four (overall 9%) in MCP and also four in
C3 (overall 9%). Three patients (overall 7%) had a mutation in
CFI and two (overall 4%) in CFB. Six patients (overall 13%)
had autoantibodies against CFH. Two of these patients with a
genetic anomaly carried a combined mutation (CFI/MCP and
CFI/C3). One patient had a CFI mutation and αFH with
ΔCFHR1/3, and in one patient αFH were seen in combination
with a C3 mutation but without ΔCFHR1/3. Patients with
combined mutations are included in both their mutation groups
in Tables 2, 3, 4. Characteristics at onset, treatment, and outcome of the four patients with combined genetic anomalies are
also summarized separately (Table 5). No mutations in THBD
were found in our cohort.
Clinical characteristics
Familial vs sporadic
Eleven patients (24%) had familial aHUS, of whom all
except two had an associated mutation. We included one
family with three sisters with a CFH mutation and another
family with two cousins with a mutation in CFB. Of the
other six patients with familial aHUS, only one family
member was included in this study because further data
were not available. All four patients in this study with a
C3 mutation have familial aHUS. Sporadic aHUS was seen
in all four patients with MCP mutation and all five patients
with αFH and ΔCFHR1/3.
Onset
In ten patients (22%), aHUS onset was before 1 year of age,
with the youngest patient being only 1 month old. In only one
of these patients was a mutation found (C3/αFH), and only
two patients had familial aHUS. The majority of aHUS
patients (53%) presented between the age of 1 and 7 years,
which is also the most common age for children with typical
HUS to present with the disease, which suggests that age at
onset cannot always help distinguish between typical and
aHUS. In 38/45 patients aHUS onset followed a triggering
event, such as gastrointestinal symptoms (74%), upper
Pediatr Nephrol (2012) 27:1283–1291 1285

respiratory tract infection (45%), and fever (32%). A combination of triggering events was seen as well; for instance,
vomiting and fever were seen in 8/45 patients. Diarrhea was
seen in 11 patients, five of whom also had fever. One patient
developed aHUS a few days after a hepatitis B vaccination,
and one patient was positively tested for a Bordetella pertussis
infection a few days before aHUS onset. Other triggers were
infection with Haemophilus influenza (n01) and a streptococcal infection (n01).
Hypertension (blood pressure >95th percentile for age)
was present at first presentation in 71% of patients. Six
patients had involvement of the central nervous system
due to malignant hypertension or cerebral infarction during
their first aHUS flare. Two of these patients had a mutation
(C3 and CFB) and one patient had αFH with ΔCFHR1/3.
These three patients had severe seizures; the other three
patients were extremely agitated or had reduced consciousness. One patient had additional visual handicap, and one
showed apraxia and aphasia. Pancreas involvement during
the first episode was seen in only two patients, both without
a genetic defect. In 18 of the 37 patients (49%) for whom
data were available, biochemical evaluation showed reduced
C3 levels (minimum 210 mg/l, reference range 900–
1,800 mg/l). Four of these patients had a mutation (2xCFB,
1xCFI, 1xC3), and four had αFH, of which three also had
ΔCFHR1/3. Low C3 levels were always linked with high
levels of the activation product C3d. However, we also
found elevated levels of C3d in six patients with normal
levels of C3. Of the 25 genetically undefined patients, 11
showed reduced C3 levels, and in seven, elevated levels of
C3d were found, showing evidence of alternative pathway
activation. Remarkably reduced C4 levels were seen in six
of the 31 tested patients (19%), with an extreme lowest level
of 30 mg/l (reference range 150–400 mg/l). A systemic
disease, such as systemic lupus erythamatosis (SLE) or
cryoglobulinemia as cause of these low C4 levels was ruled
out because of the clinical and laboratory results combined
with medical history. One of these patients had a CFH
mutation.
Treatment and outcome of first episode
The majority of patients (60%) were treated with plasma
therapy, including plasma infusion (PI) and/or plasma exchange (PE) (Table 2). Plasma therapy was applied in 12
patients with a genetic defect vs 15 patients without a
known genetic anomaly. In 11 patients, plasma therapy
was combined with dialysis. Nine patients were treated
conservatively, three of whom had a genetic defect (1xC3,
1xMCP, 1xαFH with ΔCFHR1/3). In only 3/20 patients
(15%) with a genetic defect (2xCFH, 1xMCP) was complete
remission reached after the first episode, compared with 9/

24 patients (38%) in the other group. One of these patients
(CFH mutation) was treated with plasma therapy (four infusions with fresh frozen plasma), one with dialysis (CFH
mutation), and one patient recovered spontaneously (mutation in MCP). All other patients with a genetic anomaly
reached partial remission after the first flare. Of the nine
patients without plasma therapy or dialysis, only three
reached complete remission (1xMCP, 2xno genetic
anomaly).
Chronic plasma therapy and/or dialysis was applied more
often in the group with than in the group without a genetic
defect (40% vs 30%). One patient died during the first
aHUS episode due to consequences of the disease. This
was the youngest patient in the study, only 1 month old. A
genetic defect in complement proteins was not found in this
patient.
Long-term outcome
Almost half of the aHUS patients (n021) had a relapse
(Table 3). In the group with a genetic anomaly, 13/20
(65%) of patients relapsed. In the group without known
anomalies, relapse occurred in only 8/25 (32%) patients. A
total of 43 relapses was seen, of which 29 (67%) occurred in
patients with any of the genetic subtypes. A maximum of
five relapses was seen in one patient with αFH and
ΔCFHR1/3. Of all patients with a relapse, 38% had familial
aHUS. Most relapses occurred after a viral infection, usually
of the upper respiratory tract. Time between aHUS onset and
the first relapse varied widely, from 1 month after remission
to a maximum of 8.5 years. In 9/21 patients, aHUS relapsed
within 1 year, five had a genetic defect (1xCFH, 1xMCP,
1xC3/CFI, and 2xαFH with ΔCFHR1/3). Ten patients with

a relapse were initially treated with plasma therapy, eight of
whom received chronic plasma therapy. In most patients,
plasma therapy was intensified during the relapse.
In 54% of patients, chronic hypertension was seen after
the first flare; in 47%, proteinuria sustained. Most of these
patients had to be treated for several months with antihypertensive agents. In four patients, neurological involvement
was seen later during the course of disease. Two of these
patients presented with seizures due to malignant hypertension (MCP and C3/CFI); one patient without a genetic
defect had reduced consciousness [computed tomography
(CT) scan showed no abnormalities], and one patient had
dysphasia and sensibility disorders due to an arteria
cerebralis media stenosis (CFH). Another patient developed
necrotizing pancreatitis with transient diabetes mellitus 10
years after first presentation, for which a partial pancreatectomy was performed. No mutation or deletion was found in
this patient.
Seven patients (2xCFH, 1xMCP, 1xC3/CFI, and three
without a known genetic defect) received a total number of
13 renal transplants, but in 10/13 grafts, aHUS recurred.
Three of these patients had familial aHUS. No recurrence
was seen in patient with MCP mutation. Time between
transplantation and first relapse in renal graft patients varied
between 6 days and 4 years. Additionally, one graft was lost
due to arteria renalis thrombosis 1 day after transplantation;

one graft was lost due to rejection after 4 years. One patient
died during the acute phase of aHUS. Three other patients
died later during the course of disease. One patient with no
genetic defect died 9 years after onset because of massive
cerebral bleeding due to malignant hypertension. Another
patient with an MCP mutation, who had no recurrence of
aHUS in the renal transplant, developed pulmonary venoocclusive disease (PVOD), which led eventually to the
finding of an inborn error of cobalamin metabolism, and
he died 7.5 years after his first presentation [21]. The last
patient died 12 years after aHUS onset but not due to the
consequences of aHUS.
Discussion
In this study, we found that in 45 children diagnosed with
aHUS, genetic disorders in complement-regulating genes
encoding CFH, CFI, MCP, CFB, C3, and THBD, as well
as the presence of αFH with or without a homozygous
deletion in CFHR1/3, are linked with clinical presentation,
treatment, and outcome. In almost 50% of this pediatric
aHUS cohort, a genetic defect in complement-regulating
genes was found. This finding is compatible with the previous French pediatric report of Sellier-Leclerc et al. and the
Italian adult/pediatric registry reported by Noris et al. [3, 6].
Most mutations (overall 13%) were found in CFH, which
corresponds to the literature [3, 5, 6, 9]. The number of
mutations in MCP and C3 were equal (overall 9%). Fewer
mutations (overall 7%) were found in CFI, just as seen in
the pediatric French cohort. Mutations in CFB are relatively
rare [6, 9] and according to the literature occur in only 1–2%
of patients with aHUS [2]. We identified a genetic aberration
in CFB in 4.4% of our patients, but it must be mentioned
that these two patients were related. Delvaeye et al. report
that about 5% of patients with aHUS have mutations that
impair thrombomodulin function [6, 19]. Remarkably, in
our cohort, no aHUS-associated thrombomodulin mutations
were found.
Dragon-Durey et al. were the first to describe the association between αFH and aHUS [15], and more recently an
association between the presence of αFH and a homozygous
polymorphic deletion in CFHR1/3 was described [17]. In
our population, 13% of all patients had αFH, and 83% of
these patients (overall 11%) had an additional ΔCFHR1/3,
which corresponds well to previous published data [15–18].

One of the most important observations in this cohort is
that 74% of aHUS patients showed gastrointestinal symptoms, of which 25% presented with diarrhea. This clearly
shows that postdiarrheal onset does not exclude the possibility of aHUS. This makes differentiating between typical
HUS and aHUS for the general pediatrician sometimes even
more difficult and may even result in a delay of adequate
treatment in these patients. Also, relapses seem to occur
most often after a triggering event, usually an upper airway
infection or gastroenteritis. Remarkably, in one patient,
aHUS relapsed twice after a cytomegalovirus infection for
which daily PE and ganciclovir were initiated [22]. In one
other patient, aHUS onset followed a hepatitis B vaccination
a few days earlier. The triggering role of vaccination in this
patient was confirmed by a relapse shortly after combined
anti-diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus-polio vaccination.
In only 18 of the 37 tested patients (49%) were C3
plasma levels reduced, which indicates, as shown by others,
that normal C3 levels in aHUS patients do not reflect complement activation on the endothelial cell surfaces. Normal
C3 levels also do not rule out the existence of mutations in
genes encoding complement-regulating proteins. Breakdown products of C3 activation, such as C3d, as well as
soluble complement complex C5b-9 (SC5b-9), might be a
better serum marker for complement activation in aHUS
patients.
Although at this time results of the use of eculizumab in
patients with aHUS look very promising [23, 24] and might
replace plasma therapy in the near future, at present, plasma
therapy is considered the gold standard treatment in patients
with aHUS and should be started within 24 h of diagnosis
[25]. However, only 60% of our population received plasma
therapy (with or without dialysis). This is due to the fact that
in our study, patients were included at the time their DNA
was sent to the laboratory between 2001 and 2010, a time
when knowledge about aHUS treatment was growing. However, those patients’ first or even second HUS episode was
sometimes long before that period, when no clear therapy
schedules were available. Of the patients treated without
plasma therapy, 44% were diagnosed and already treated
before 2000. Only in recent years have new treatment guidelines for aHUS been published [25]. Since the latest guideline in 2008, every patient in this study was treated with
plasma therapy.
In our cohort, seven patients received a total number of
13 kidney transplants. In five of these seven patients, transplantation was performed before the existence of genetic
complement mutations was known and before plasmapheresis as treatment of aHUS was well accepted. Four of these
patients had a genetic defect (1xMCP, 2xCFH, and 1xCFI/
C3). All except one (MCP) graft failed (93%), again demonstrating that kidney transplantation is compromised by the
risk of recurrence [2, 3, 5, 6, 26, 27]. Renal transplantation
in patients with aHUS should not be performed without
DNA analysis for all involved complement genes due to
the fact that this leads to a better defined risk profile for
relapses.
Currently, aHUS patients having a CFH or CFI mutation
who will have a single kidney transplantation are advised to
combine this with prophylactic plasmapheresis and life-long
PE [28], or else these patients are advised to have a combined liver–kidney transplantation with preoperative PE,
intraoperative PI, and posttransplant anticoagulation [27].
In the near future, one might expect that lifelong prophylactic treatment with complement inhibitors will replace the use
of plasma and /or the combination of plasma with liver and/
or renal transplantation in aHUS patients with CFH or CFI
mutations [23, 24].
In conclusion, in almost 50% of pediatric aHUS patients,
a genetic abnormality was found. In 87% of patients, aHUS
onset followed a triggering event; 25% of cases presented
with diarrhea, which makes differentiating between typical
and aHUS difficult. Half of the patients (21/43) had a
relapse (67% of them with a genetic anomaly), and all
except one renal graft failed, so renal transplantation should
not be performed before adequate DNA analysis of the
involved complement genes. In the near future, nextgeneration sequencing methods, such as whole exome or
genome sequencing, will more easily facilitate DNA mutation analysis, and new genes will probably be identified that
might be associated with aHUS as well. With the use of
complement inhibitors in the ongoing trials in aHUS
patients, a new era in the treatment of patients with aHUS
has begun. It has yet to be demonstrated whether this treatment will improve the overall results in aHUS patients and
hopefully reduce the requirement for dialysis and renal
transplantations.
