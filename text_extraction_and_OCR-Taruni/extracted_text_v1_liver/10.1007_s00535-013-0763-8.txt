Abstract
Background A combination of hepatitis B immunoglobulin and nucleos(t)ide analogues is the current standard of
care for controlling hepatitis B recurrence after orthotopic
liver transplantation (OLT). However, frequent immunoglobulin treatment is expensive and inconvenient. This
study investigated the efficacy of hepatitis B virus (HBV)
vaccination in preventing the recurrence of hepatitis B after
living donor OLT.
Methods Twenty-seven patients who had undergone living donor OLT participated in the study; five had acute
HBV infected liver failure (ALF-OLT) and 22 had HBV
related liver cirrhosis (LC-OLT). Hepatitis B surface
antigen (HBsAg)-containing vaccine was administered to
them for at least 1 year after transplantation and continued
once monthly for up to 36 months post-OLT. Patients who
had anti-HBs antibody titers above 100 mIU/mL for a
minimum of 6 months without immunoglobulin administration were defined as good responders; the others were
defined as poor responders. Interferon-c enzyme-linked
immunospot assays against HBs and HBc antigens were
used to assay cellular immune responses.
Results All five of the ALF-OLT patients had good
responses after a median of four (range 2.5–5) vaccinations. Nine of the 22 LC-OLT patients had good responses
after a median of 19 (range 11.5–30) vaccinations. Among
the LC-OLT group, those with livers donated by relatively
higher-aged, marital and high-titer anti-HBs antibody
donors were good responders. LC-OLT patients classed as
good responders showed interferon-c responses comparable to those of the ALF-OLT patients.
Conclusions The ALF-OLT and LC-OLT patients who
received livers from relatively higher-aged, marital, high-titer
anti-HBs antibody donors were the best candidates for HBV
vaccine administration. Boosting donors before transplantation may facilitate later vaccine response of the recipients.

Introduction
Prior to the introduction of effective post-transplantation
antiviral prophylaxis, liver transplantation for hepatitis B
virus (HBV)-related disease was usually followed by
immediate HBV reinfection of the allograft, resulting in a
fatal hepatitis B recurrence [1–3]. Recent studies have
found that treatment with a combination of hepatitis B

immunoglobulin (HBIg) and nucleos(t)ide analogues
decreases the risk of hepatitis B recurrence, and achieves a
higher rate of graft survival [4–8]. However, long-term
administration of HBIg is associated with several unresolved issues, including limited availability and extremely
high cost, so several protocols for treatment with low-dose
HBIg in combination with nucleos(t)ide analogue have
been reported [9–12]. Previously, we reported that treatment with high-dose HBIg in the early period post-transplantation followed by low-dose HBIg with nucleos(t)ide
analogues offers reliable, cost-effective control of hepatitis
B recurrence [13]. However, even with such a simplified
protocol, patients would still need to receive a drip infusion
or intramuscular injection of hundreds to thousands of units
of HBIg every 2–3 months.
Active immunization of post-orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) recipients with HBV vaccine is a recently
emerging approach. However, most studies report low
response rates, even with double concentration of vaccines
or prolonged vaccination regimens [14, 15]. Patients who
had not been HBV carriers [e.g., acute liver failure (ALF)
patients following sexual transmission of HBV as an adult;
or non-chronic HBV carrier patients who received hepatitis
B core antibody (HBcAb)-positive livers] are accepted as
good candidates for vaccine administration [15, 16]. Vaccination in patients who have been HBV carriers or liver
cirrhosis (LC) patients typically yields disappointing
results [14, 15]. Understanding how different cohorts
respond to HBV vaccination is critical to the design of safe,
cost-saving, and custom-designed prophylaxis protocols.
It remains unclear to what extent cellular immune
responses may contribute to protection from HBV reinfection. Since non-carrier patients respond well to the HBV
vaccination, immune tolerance is expected to play a large
role in this process. Yet only a few reports have mentioned
T cell immune reaction after HBV-related OLT [14].
In this report, we assessed a monthly, long-term vaccination protocol starting 1 year after OLT, to investigate
those characteristics that could discriminate between the
vaccine-responsive and non-responsive patients. In addition to anti-hepatitis B surface (anti-HBs) antibody titer
due to a humoral immune response, CD4 T cell immune
responses to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) were
used to assess the cellular immune response to vaccination
in immunocompetent patients.
Methods
Patients
From October 1996 to June 2011, OLT was performed in
264 adults at Okayama University Hospital. Of these, ten
patients had ALF due to acute HBV infection. Thirty-seven
patients had end-stage LC due to chronic life-long HBV
infection. Five-year survival rates were 88 and 87 % for
HBV-related ALF patients and for HBV-related LC
patients, respectively.
The HBV vaccine was administered to five ALF patients
(ALF-OLT) and 22 LC patients (LC-OLT). The general
characteristics of the patients included in this study are
summarized in Table 1. All of them received living donor
liver transplantation (LDLT). The numerical data are
expressed as median and interquartile range values, and
categorical data are presented as positive counts or percentages in all tables.
For analysis of the HBV-specific cellular immune
response (Table 2), the study enrolled all five ALF-OLT
patients, along with 15 of the 22 LC-OLT patients. Additionally, 11 healthy volunteers who had received the HBV
vaccine and developed a successful anti-HBs antibody
response (termed ‘Healthy vaccine’), ten patients with
chronic hepatitis B (termed ‘Chronic hepatitis’), and five
patients who recovered from acute hepatitis B (termed
‘Self-limited’) were enrolled as controls. The five patients
who recovered from acute hepatitis B had a history of acute
hepatitis B diagnosed with high-titer IgM-HBc antibody
response, and presented as HBsAg negative, anti-HBs
antibody positive, anti-HBc antibody positive at the time of

the study. The chronic hepatitis B patients were followed
for several years at our hospital and all were HBsAg
positive with a median HBV-DNA titer of 2.5 (interquartile
range 2.1–4.2) logcopies/mL. The healthy volunteers had
no HBsAg and anti-HBc antibodies, and the median antiHBs antibody level was 240 (interquartile range
100–797) mIU/mL.
Informed consent was obtained from each patient
included in the study, and the study protocol conformed to
the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki,
as reflected in the approval by the Ethics Committee at the
Okayama University Hospital.
Antiviral prophylaxis
Our HBV prophylaxis protocol was as follows. We
administered HBIg at 200 IU/kg intraoperatively. Recipients were administered another 2000 IU/week HBIg for an
additional 1 week post-operatively. HBIg (2000 IU) was
administered thereafter only when anti-HBs antibody titers
fell below 100 mIU/mL. After 6 months, HBIg was
administered only to maintain anti-HBs antibody titers at
[10 mIU/mL. We measured levels of HBsAg and antiHBs antibody and/or HBV-DNA every month for 6 months
after LDLT, and every 2–3 months thereafter. Three of the
ALF-OLT patients were anti-HBs antibody positive at the
time of OLT, these patients were not administered nucleos(t)ide analogues. The remaining two ALF-OLT patients,
and all of the LC patients were given nucleos(t)ide analogues. The two ALF-OLT patients were given lamivudine
(LAM), and of the 22 LC-OLT patients, 14 received LAM,
six were given LAM ? adefovir dipivoxyl (ADV), and two
received entecavir (ETV). Administration of nucleos(t)ide
analogues was started a minimum of 1 month pre-operatively, when possible.
Post-OLT re-activation of HBV was defined as continuous positivity for serum HBsAg and/or serum HBVDNA.
HBV vaccine protocol
HBV vaccine administration was initiated at least 1 year
after OLT, and when patients showed no active infection or
rejection episode in the preceding month. The vaccine
consisted of recombinant purified HBsAg (Bimmugen;
Kaketsuken, Kumamoto, Japan). Ten micrograms were
administered every 1–2 months. Based on the effect of
the vaccine, patients were classified as ‘‘good responders;
LC-OLT good’’ or ‘‘poor responders; LC-OLT poor’’.
Patients who showed anti-HBs antibody titers above
100 mIU/mL without HBIg for a minimum of 6 months
were defined as good responders, since all of these patients
did not need HBIg administration for an additional 2 years
(median) of follow-up. All other patients were defined as
poor responders. Patients who showed a good response
within 36 months were given additional vaccinations when
their anti-HBs antibody titer decreased, whereas vaccination was stopped in patients who showed no good response
after 36 months.
Immune suppression
Patients were treated using a standard immunosuppressive
regimen (tacrolimus or cyclosporine A with steroids and/or
mycophenolate mofetil). One patient was free from calcineurin inhibitors at the time of vaccine administration.
Routine laboratory tests and serum HBV-DNA assay
Hepatitis B surface antigen, anti-HBs antibody, hepatitis
Be antigen (HBeAg), and anti-HBe antibody (HBeAb)
levels were measured routinely using a commercially
available chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay system
(Lumipulse System; Fujirebio, Tokyo, Japan). HBV-DNA
levels were measured using a transcription-mediated
amplification assay (TMA) (SRL, Tokyo, Japan), a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay (Amplicor HBV

Monitor assay; Roche Diagnostics, Tokyo, Japan), or a
real-time PCR assay (COBAS TaqMan HBV Test; Roche
Diagnostics).
HBV recombinant proteins for cellular immune
response analysis
Hepatitis B virus recombinant protein HBsAg was purchased from Advanced ImmunoChemical, Inc. (Long
Beach, CA). Recombinant protein hepatitis B core antigen
(HBcAg) was purchased from the Institute of Immunology
(Tokyo, Japan). These proteins were used as stimulating
antigens at 1 lg/mL for the enzyme-linked immunospot
(ELISPOT) assay.
CD14-positive monocyte isolation and myeloid DC
generation
Mononuclear cells were separated from peripheral blood
by centrifugation on the Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient
(Amersham Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden), as previously
described. CD14-positive monocytes were purified using
microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) in accordance
with the protocols of the manufacturer. Subsequently,
CD4-positive T cells (T4) were positively sorted in the
same way. T4 cells were frozen immediately. CD14-positive cells were cultured at 1 9 106
/mL in RPMI containing
5 % heat-inactivated human AB serum (ICN Biomedicals;
Aurora, OH) supplemented with 100 ng/mL of granulocyte
macrophage colony-stimulating factor (kindly provided by
Kirin Pharma, Tokyo, Japan) and 50 ng/mL of interleukin4 (kindly provided by Ono Pharmaceuticals, Osaka, Japan)
at 37 C in 5 % CO2 for 5 days. Cells were confirmed to be
CD11c-positive myeloid immature dendritic cells (DC).
Interferon-c (IFNc) ELISPOT assay with myeloid DC
and CD4-positive T-cells
The immature DC cultures were exposed to recombinant
HBsAg and HBcAg (1 lg/mL each) for 1 day. To mature
the DCs, 1 ng/mL of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Sigma, St.
Louis, MO) was added to the culture 1 day after HBV
protein addition. On the same day, mouse anti-human
interferon-c antibody (MABTECH, Sweden) was diluted to
5 lg/mL with ELISPOT buffer (0.159 % Na2CO3,
0.293 % NaHCO3) and coated overnight at 4 C onto
96-well filtration plates (Millipore, Billerica, MA) at
100 lL per well. The coated plate was washed with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and blocked with 10 %
fetal calf serum in RPMI1640 medium for 1–2 h. Myeloid
DCs were counted and seeded at 5 9 103
/well. Cryopreserved T4 cells were thawed, counted, and seeded at
2 9 105
/well. On the next day, the plate was washed six
times with PBS. Wells were coated with rabbit anti-interferon-c serum (diluted to 1/800 in PBS), and the plate was
incubated at 37 C for 2 h. The plate was washed six times
with PBS and coated with goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin
G-alkaline phosphatase (IgG-AP; Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL) diluted to 1/2000 with PBS. After a 1 h
incubation at 37 C, the plate was washed six times with
water and spots were developed using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-
indolyl phosphate p-toluidine salt and nitroblue tetrazolium
chloride (BCIP/NBT) as a substrate. Spot development was
stopped after 10 min by washing with distilled water. The
spots were viewed and counted under a microscope.
Statistical analysis
Statistical comparisons were performed using JMP version
9 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). The Wilcoxon rank-sum
test was used to compare the continuous data and the Chisquare test was used to compare categorical data. For
multivariate analysis, logistic regression analysis was used.
The Steel–Dwass test was used for multiple group analysis.
A p value of \0.05 was considered significant.
Results
The effects of HBV vaccination
None of the patients in the ALF-OLT group showed
reactivation of the virus. One patient of the LC-OLT group
showed transient positive responses for HBsAg and HBV
DNA, however, these became negative again with frequent
HBIg administration. At the final observation point, no
patients showed HBsAg or HBV DNA-positive response.
All five ALF-OLT patients had good responses to vaccination (Table 3). A median of four (range 2.5–5) vaccinations were sufficient to induce a good response. In
contrast, LC-OLT patients were less responsive, with only
nine of 22 displaying a good response. Additionally, these
nine good responders required a median of 19 (range
11.5–30) vaccinations before these patients could be
weaned from HBIg administration (Fig. 1).

Vaccine safety
None of the patients showed any adverse reactions as
judged by their general condition, or by laboratory examination. One patient reported itchiness after injection of the
eighth vaccination dose, although the symptom subsequently stopped.
The characteristics of vaccine responsiveness
in LC-OLT patients
To determine the characteristics for defining a good
response in LC-OLT patients, clinical data from recipients
and donors were investigated (Table 4). The background
data of the recipients, including HBV-DNA levels, HBeAg
positive reactions, HBsAg levels at the time of OLT, and
the anti-HBs antibody titer at the time of the initial vaccination did not differ between the good and poor
responder groups (Table 5). However, the donor-related
factors did differ. Notably, the good responders’ donors
were relatively high in age (p = 0.019) and not blood
relatives of the recipients (p\0.001). These donors (to
good responders) showed high anti-HBs antibody titers at
the time of OLT (p = 0.038). Since all of the patients in
this study received LDLT, non-blood-related donors all
corresponded to spouses of the OLT recipients. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was carried out with the
following variables: donor age at OLT C47, non-bloodrelated donor, donor anti-HBs antibody titer[100 mIU/mL
(Table 6). A status of non-blood-related donor was identified as a significant independent predictor of a good
response to vaccination. Since the donor anti-HBs antibody
was one of the factors associated with a good response, we
asked whether the donors had received vaccination, and
found that none of them had ever received an HBV vaccine. As shown in Table 4, none of the donors showed the
anti-HBc antibody-negative, anti-HBs antibody-positive
condition which indicates vaccine-induced seropositivity to
the HBs antigen.
HBV antigen-specific immune responses
To determine the effectiveness of vaccine-induced cellular immune responses in post-OLT patients, we used the
IFN-c ELISPOT assay. First of all, we analyzed the
clinical characteristics of those patients showing strong
HBsAg-specific T cell immune responses when compared
with those of non-transplanted patients, and vaccineinduced anti-HBs antibody-positive, healthy volunteers
(Fig. 2). The patients with stronger HBsAg-specific CD4
T cell IFN-c responses (equal or more than the median; 7
spots) showed lower levels of HBV DNA, lower HBsAg,
higher anti-HBs antibody titer, and higher HBcAg-specific
immune responses. The HBsAg and HBcAg-specific CD4
T cell immune response under different clinical conditions
is shown (Fig. 3). Volunteer controls who were positive
for anti-HBs antibodies (as a result of previous vaccine
administration) showed numerous HBsAg-specific IFNc
spots. Spot numbers were reduced in control chronic
hepatitis B patients, but remained high (against both
HBsAg and HBcAg) in acute resolved hepatitis B
patients. The ALF-OLT and LC-OLT good responders
had relatively higher HBsAg-specific T-cell immune
responses than LC-OLT poor responders. The LC-OLT
patients with successful vaccine-induced humoral immune
responses also showed higher cellular immune responses
than control chronic hepatitis B patients. The LC-OLT
patients with poor vaccine responses also had low cellular
responses, similar to those seen in chronic hepatitis B
patients.
Discussion
In this study we found that HBV vaccination was effective
in OLT patients whose donors were relatively high in age,
marital (non-blood-related), with high-titer anti-HBs antibodies. The multivariate analysis revealed that a marital
(non-blood-related) donor was the only factor that associated strongly with a good response to vaccine. Among
these OLT recipients, a good response to vaccination
included effective responses in both the humoral and cellular arms of the immune system.
Controlling HBV reactivation after OLT is critical. In
the absence of prophylaxis, hepatitis B recurs very frequently and results in early graft failure. The prophylaxis
protocols have progressed from HBIg immunoprophylaxis
in the early 1990s, to lamivudine in the late 1990s, to the
more recent application of HBIg combined with nucleos(t)ide analogues. In 1991, Muller et al. [17] reported the
first use of long-term HBIg immunoprophylaxis, reducing
the HBV recurrence rate to 25 % after 6 months of OLT
and 18 % after 12 months. A multicenter study revealed
that the three-year risk of HBV recurrence was 75 ± 6 %
without HBIg, 74 ± 5 % with short-term (2-month) HBIg,
and 36 ± 4 % with long-term ([6-month) HBIg treatment
[18]. Patients who were positive for HBeAg or HBV-DNA
displayed the greatest risk of recurrence (83 %); patients
with acute fulminant liver failure showed the lowest risk
(16 %).
In 1996, Grellier et al. [19] reported a trial of LAM as a
prophylactic treatment, achieving 18 % recurrence of HBV
at 6 months after OLT. However, the long-term recurrence
rate at 3 years after OLT progressed to 41 %, indicating
that LAM monotherapy is not recommendable for posttransplantation prophylaxis.

Although monotherapy with HBIg or LAM resulted in a
high rate of recurrence, a combination of these agents has
been administered with reasonable success. In 1998,
Markowitz et al. [20] reported no recurrences after 1 year
of combination therapy. Since HBIg is very expensive,
several reports have described modified combination

with short-term, high-dose HBIg followed by low-dose
HBIg (sufficient to maintain an anti-HBs antibody titer of
[10 mIU/mL) is cost-effective and powerful enough
to control HBV recurrence after LDLT [13]. With this
cost-saving method, no clinical evidence of HBV recurrence has been seen.
In 2000, Sanchez-Fueyo et al. [21] reported an 82 %

used three cycles of double-dose recombinant HBsAg
vaccine for immunization over 6 months, with a target
antibody titer of [10 mIU/mL. The cohort included six
acute infected patients and 11 chronic carriers. However,
recent reports show that chronic HBV carrier recipients did
not respond well, with response rates ranging from 7.7 to
12.5 % [22, 23]. Acute HBV-infected patients who
underwent OLT were often positive for the anti-HBs
antibody even before OLT, with strong immune responses.
Such patients might be expected to respond well to vaccination, since these individuals (unlike chronic carriers)
have not developed a tolerance to HBV. In our patients,
five acute infected patients showed good responses to
vaccination, responding after a median of only four vaccinations. These results indicate that while acute HBVinfected patients are good candidates for HBV vaccination
post-OLT; chronic HBV carriers are poorer candidates for
this protocol. However, as some HBV carriers did respond
to vaccination; further studies should be performed to
clarify the differences between the good and poor
responders.
Several reports have identified the differences between
good responders and poor responders in non-HBV-infected
patients who received HBcAb-positive donor livers.
Lacking previous HBV exposure, these recipients should
not have developed tolerance to the virus and so should
have been good responders. Of these, good responses were
seen in pediatric cases where the recipients had higher antiHBs antibody titers at the time of OLT and lower tacrolimus levels at the time of vaccination [24]. The present
study revealed that repeated vaccine administration resulted in successful immunization in 40 % of the LC-OLT
recipients. For these recipients, the strength of the response
did not correlate with recipient characteristics, not even
with age, one of the most important factors for successful
immunization [25]. In contrast, the characteristics of the
donor were important. The good responders’ donors were
relatively high in age, non-blood-related and had high antiHBs antibody titers before donation. Note that, in our trial,
the term ‘‘non-blood-related donor’’ indicates the spouse of
the recipient, since deceased donor liver transplantation is
not widely accepted in Japan [26]. The donors with hightiter anti-HBs antibody probably were infected with HBV
by the recipients after their marriage, resulting in the antiHBs antibody boost. These donors’ immune systems
should not have developed tolerance to the virus. This
elevated immunity might be the reason why our patients
had relatively better outcomes following vaccination than
those of previous reports [27]. Adoptive immune transfer
of HBV-specific immune response could be possible [28].
For successful transfer of immune memory to the recipients, the anti-HBs antibody titer of the donors should be
high, and vaccine-induced anti-HBs antibody might be less
effective than antibodies produced in a previous self-limited infection. Luo et al. [29] have shown that a particularly
high anti-HBs antibody titer ([1000 IU/L) in the donor is
essential for adoptive immune transfer. The results of the
present study suggest that HBV vaccination of non-bloodrelated living donor candidates having a lower anti-HBs
antibody titer (\100 mIU/mL) might facilitate improved
vaccine response post-OLT in LC recipients.
The present study of HBV vaccine efficacy in ALF-OLT
and LC-OLT patients revealed that the vaccine response
depended on the immune tolerance to the virus in both
recipients and donors. The liver is the biggest immune
organ in the abdomen and so can play a critical role in
immune responses. Multiple populations of non-hematopoietic liver cells, including sinusoidal endothelial cells,
stellate cells located in the subendothelial space, and liver
parenchymal cells, take on the roles of antigen-presenting
cells [30]. The viral-specific immune competence of the
grafted liver might overcome the general immunotolerance
to the virus in chronic HBV carriers.
In conclusion, patients who received OLT due to acute
infection of HBV were good candidates for HBV vaccination. The chronic HBV carrier recipients who received
livers from donors who were non-blood-related (i.e, the
recipient’s spouse) and who harbored high anti-HBs antibody titers were the best candidates for HBV vaccine
administration. Vaccine-induced, HBV-specific immune
responses were strong enough to induce not only humoral
but also cellular responses in vitro.
