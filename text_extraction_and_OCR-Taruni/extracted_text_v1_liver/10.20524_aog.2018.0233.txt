Abstract Background The objective of this study was to investigate the incidence, demographics, tumor 
characteristics, treatment, and survival of patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma.
Methods Data on Klatskin tumors between 2004 and 2013 was extracted from the Surveillance, 
Epidemiology and End Results Registry. The epidemiology of these tumors was then analyzed.
Results A total of 254 patients with Klatskin tumors were identified. The overall age-adjusted incidence 
of Klatskin tumors between 2004 and 2013 was 0.38 per 1,000,000 per year. A gradual decline in the 
incidence was noted, with the highest (0.44) in 2005 and lowest (0.24) in 2010. Males had a higher 
incidence of Klatskin tumors compared to females (0.47 vs. 0.25 per 1,000,000 per year). These tumors 
were more common among Asian and Pacific islanders, who had an age-adjusted incidence rate of 
0.48 per 1,000,000. Incidence increased with age, with the peak incidence between the ages of 80 and 
84 years. The majority of the tumors were extrahepatic (67.3%). Approximately one-fourth (22.4%) of 
these patients had metastatic disease at presentation. Only 26.8% of patients had surgically resectable
disease at presentation. One-  and 5-year cause-specific survival for Klatskin tumors was 41% and 
10.4%, respectively, with a median survival of 7  months. On Cox proportional hazard regression 
analysis, extrahepatic tumors (hazard ratio [HR] 0.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37-0.80, P=0.02) 
and those treated surgically (HR 0.47, 95%CI 0.29-0.77, P=0.003) had significantly better outcomes.
Conclusions Klatskin tumors are rare and have a very poor prognosis with low survival rate. 
Among these tumors, extrahepatic and surgically treated tumors tend to have better outcomes.

Introduction
Cholangiocarcinomas (CCAs) are rare tumors, comprising 
3% of all gastrointestinal tumors originating from the intra- or 
extrahepatic bile duct epithelium. They represent the second 
most common primary hepatic malignancy [1]. Approximately 
50% of CCAs are perihilar or hilar, 40% are distal extrahepatic, 
and only 10% or less are intrahepatic [2]. In 1965, Klatskin 
identified CCAs originating from the hepatic duct bifurcation 
and named these hilar tumors as Klatskin tumors [3]. Klatskin 
tumors, or hilar CCAs, are bile duct tumors that involve the 
common hepatic duct bifurcation but may arise from the 
intrahepatic (IHCCA) or extrahepatic (EHCCA) portion of 
the biliary tree [4]. It has also been suggested that EHCCA 
and IHCCA should be combined as perihilar CCA, given 
the similarities in their behavior and treatment methods  [5]. 
A comparison of the 10-year prevalence of these tumors between 
1990 and 2000 in the United States showed a high age-adjusted 
prevalence of IHCCA in Hispanics, with the lowest prevalence 
among African Americans and Asian Pacific islanders [1].
Our current knowledge of the pathogenesis of CCA in general, 
in comparison to other gastrointestinal tumors, is limited. Genetic 
abnormalities and molecular defects in various oncogenes may 
play a role. A role for chronic inflammation and cholestasis in 
carcinogenesis has been also stipulated [1]. Various risk factors 
have been identified: primary sclerosing cholangitis [6-8], parasitic 
infestation (Clonorchis [9], Opisthorchis [10]), cholelithiasis [11], 
fibrocystic liver disease  [12], toxins (thorotrast, rubber and 
chemical industries)  [13], chronic liver disease [14-17], Lynch

syndrome and biliary papillomatosis [18]. Histologically, the 
majority of these tumors are adenocarcinomas followed by 
squamous cell carcinomas.
International Classification of Disease – Oncology (ICD-O) 
consists of two coding systems to describe a tumor: i) the 
topographical code, which describes the anatomical site of origin 
of the tumor; and ii) the morphological code, which describes 
the histology of the tumor along with the behavior (malignant 
or benign). ICD-O-3 has been available since 2000 and was 
last revised in 2013. In the prior version, i.e. ICD-O-2, Klatskin 
tumors were assigned to the topography code for intrahepatic 
biliary duct tumors only, whereas in ICD-O-3, these hilar tumors 
were reassigned topographical codes for either intrahepatic 
or extrahepatic biliary duct tumors. Previous analysis of 
Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) data [19] 
noted that, before ICD-O-3, 91% of the Klatskin tumors were 
incorrectly coded as intrahepatic biliary duct (IHBD) tumors, 
leading to an overestimation of the latter’s incidence by 13% and 
an underestimation of extrahepatic biliary duct (EHBD) tumors. 
The switch to ICD-O-3 in 2001 resulted in Klatskin tumors being 
coded as EHBD, with a subsequent rise in their incidence [19,20]. 
In addition, ICD-O-3 referenced hilar CCA histology code 
8162/3 to topographies for both IHCCA and EHCCA.
Although several studies have reported on CCAs and their 
extrahepatic, intrahepatic and hilar types, studies focusing 
on Klatskin tumors are lacking. In this study, we present the 
epidemiology, tumor characteristics, treatment, and survival 
profile of Klatskin tumors diagnosed between 2004 and 
2013. We further evaluate differences between extra-  and 
intrahepatic Klatskin tumors, as prior reports suggest that they 
tend to present and behave differently.
Patients and methods
Data were extracted from the National Cancer Institute’s SEER 
registry. The SEER registry is an extensive data center of cancer 
incidence, staging, treatment and survival from population-based 
cancer registries of the United States. The SEER Program registries 
collect data on patient demographics, primary tumor site, tumor 
morphology, and stage at diagnosis, treatment, and follow up, and 
publish cancer incidence and survival data from cancer registries 
covering approximately 30% of the US population. SEER includes 
26% of African Americans, 38% of Hispanics, 44% of American 
Indians and Alaska Natives, 50% of Asians, and 67% of Hawaiian/
Pacific islanders. It comprises 18 cancer registries that gather data 
from 18 geographical areas of United States [21].
Data collection
Between 2004 and 2013, all cases of Klatskin tumors were 
extracted from the population-based cancer registries of the 
program. These dates were selected to avoid inclusion of the 
incorrectly coded tumors prior to the implementation of ICD-O-3 
[22]. To identify the cases, various combinations of topographical 
and histology codes based on ICD-O-3 were used [23]. The 
topographical codes used for Klatskin tumors were: C22.0, C22.1, 
and C24.0. The ICD-O-3 histological code used for Klatskin tumors 
was 8162/3. Only malignant and microscopically confirmed cases 
were included. American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 2004 
staging was available for the majority of cases and this was used. 
Survival was calculated for first primary Klatskin tumors only. 
Cases in which survival duration was unknown were excluded.
Statistical analysis
The incidence rates were calculated as the number of new 
cases per 1,000,000 person-years, age-adjusted to the 2000 US 
population. Significance for a trend in incidence was evaluated 
by testing the hypothesis that the annual percentage change was 
equal to zero. SEER*Stat 8.3.2 [23] was used to calculate ageadjusted incidence, age-wise distribution, and annual percentage 
change in incidence. For all other demographic and survival 
data, cases were copied to Excel and then analyzed using SPSS 
(IBM Corp. Released 2012. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, 
Version 21.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp). Pearson’s chi-square test 
was used for all categorical variables, while the Mann-Whitney 
U test was used to compare medians between continuous 
variables. Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted for survival analysis 
and 1- and 5- year survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier 
method. A Cox proportional hazard regression model was then 
used to determine predictors of survival.
Results
Incidence
The overall age-adjusted incidence of Klatskin tumors 
between 2004 and 2013 was 0.38 per 1,000,000 per year 
(Table 1). There was a higher incidence of Klatskin tumors in 
males compared to females (0.47  vs. 0.25 per 1,000,000 per 
year). These tumors were more common among Asian and 
Pacific islanders, who had an age-adjusted incidence rate of 
0.48 per 1,000,000. A  gradual decline in the incidence was 
noted, with the highest incidence (0.44) in 2005 and the lowest 
(0.24) in 2010 (Fig. 1). Incidence increased with age, with peak 
incidence between the ages of 80 to 84  years. No cases were 
reported in patients younger than 24 years of age (Fig. 2).

Demographics and tumor characteristics
A total of 254 patients with Klatskin tumors who met our 
inclusion criteria were identified from the SEER database. The 
demographic and tumor characteristics are shown in Table 2. 
The majority of the tumors were extrahepatic (67.3%) and 
moderately differentiated (15.7%). The most common stage at 
presentation was Stage II (22.8%), followed by Stage IV (22.4%). 
The majority (72.0%) of these tumors received radiation therapy, 
whereas only 26.8% were amenable to surgical resection.
Cause-specific survival and predictors of survival
One- and 5-year cause-specific survival for Klatskin tumors 
was 41% and 10.4%, respectively, with a median survival 
of 7  months (Fig.  3, Table  3). On Cox proportional hazard 
regression analysis, extrahepatic tumors (hazard ratio [HR] 
0.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37-0.80, P=0.02) and 
those treated surgically (HR 0.47, 95%CI 0.29-0.77, P=0.003) 
were noted to have better outcomes (Table  4). Patients’ age, 
sex, race, year of diagnosis, tumor grade, staging, and radiation 
exposure did not affect outcomes.

Discussion
Klatskin tumors, or hilar CCAs, are rare in the US 
population, but recent data suggests a rising incidence [24,25]. 
Our study provides the most recent comprehensive information 
on Klatskin tumors from the SEER cancer registry. The SEER 
database was used for this analysis as it is an extensive data center 
for cancer incidence, staging, treatment, and survival derived 
from population-based cancer registries of the United States. 
Contrary to prior reports [24], our study highlights a decline in 
the annual incidence of these tumors, with the highest incidence 
in 2005 and the lowest in 2010 (Fig. 1). The exact reason for this 
decline is not clearly understood. However, it may in part be 
explained by a possible decrease in incidence of the risk factors 
for Klatskin tumors in the US population. Further studies are 
warranted for a better understanding of this decreasing trend.
Klatskin tumors had the highest incidence among Asians 
and Pacific islanders, who had an age-adjusted incidence rate of 
0.48 per 1,000,000. Factors that explain this racial predisposition 
for Asians to developing Klatskin tumors include the increased 
rate of hepatolithiasis and liver-fluke infections among these 
patients. The highest prevalence of CCA has been reported 
from Southeast Asia [5,19,24]. The reason behind the increased 
predisposition to these tumors among Asians in the United 
States who lack the usual risk factors may, however, suggest an 
alternative pathogenesis. Our analysis noted that the incidence of 
Klatskin tumors increases with age, with a peak between 60s-80s. 
It can affect all age groups, but the age distribution seen in our 
study is similar to prior reports [26]. We noted that no cases 
were reported in patients younger than 24 years, which suggests 
chronic long-standing inflammation with advancing age leading 
to hyperplasia as an underlying pathogenic mechanism.
In a SEER analysis between 1992-2000, 91% (246 of 269) of 
hilar CCAs were reported as IHCCA. In contrast, for the years 
2001 and 2002, after the switch to ICD-O-3, 54% (22 of 41) of hilar 
CCAs were reported as IHCCA [19]. In our analysis (2004-2013), 
67% (n=171) were reported as EHCCA while only 29% (n=73) 
were IHCCA, showing an increasing trend towards EHCCA. The 
rise in incidence can in part be explained by the change in coding 
system from ICD-O-2 to ICD-O-3. However, further studies are 
needed to understand the underlying factors for this trend.
Several classification systems have been published to classify 
hilar CCA, such as the Bismuth-Corlette system, TNM staging 
by the AJCC group, and the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer 
Center classification. The AJCC staging is the most widely used 
to determine prognosis and treatment [26-28]. Our analysis 
suggests that the majority of the patients present in advanced 
stages (Stages 3-4 and T3-T4) per this staging system.
The only curative treatment for hilar CCA is margin-negative 
surgical resection, which usually consists of en bloc resection of 
the bile duct, extended liver resection and portal vein resection 
[29]. There are no trials that demonstrate a therapeutic benefit for 
radiation, chemotherapy or combination therapy. The majority of 
the patients in our analysis were treated with radiation; however, 
those treated surgically fared better. Our study notes that, even 
though surgery is the preferred treatment for these tumors, only a 
minority (26.8%) of them were amenable to surgical resection. This 
is probably because most of these patients present in stages where 
the disease is too advanced for recovery by surgical resection.
We acknowledge several limitations in our study. First, it 
had an observational and retrospective design. Though the 
SEER database is large, our sample size of 254 Klatskin tumors 
is small. In addition, SEER does not provide data on various 
topics, including chemotherapeutic regimen and dose, local and 
distant recurrence data, and comorbidities. Another limitation 
of SEER is related to the ICD-O coding error of Klatskin tumors. 
We minimized this limitation somewhat by excluding cases 
before 2004; by doing this, we were able to avoid the coding error 
associated with ICD-O-2, where Klatskin tumors were assigned 
to the topography code for intrahepatic biliary duct tumors. 
However, ICD-O-3 uses the histology code 8162/3 for either 
intra- or extrahepatic bile duct tumors and does not use specific 
codes for intra- or extrahepatic, rendering our analysis imperfect 
given the possibility of coding misclassification. This issue can 
only be solved when specific histology codes are assigned to these 
tumors. Furthermore, the SEER database lacks data regarding risk 
factors, clinical presentation, duration of symptoms, diagnostic 
modalities employed, or the use of endoscopic ultrasonography, 
cholangioscopy, fluorescence in situ hybridization for tissue 
diagnosis, positron emission tomography scan data, or details 
regarding biliary drainage, which would have made our study 
even more robust and comprehensive.

In conclusion, Klatskin tumors, or hilar CCAs, are rare 
gastrointestinal tumors that have declined in incidence over 
the past decade in the United States. The majority of these 
tumors are diagnosed in their advanced stages with metastases. 
Surgery is regarded as the best treatment modality for these 
tumors. However, only a small number of patients are treated 
surgically, probably because they present in advanced stages. 
The tumors continue to carry a poor prognosis, with median 
survival duration measured in months.

Summary Box
What is already known:
•	 Klatskin tumors, or hilar cholangiocarcinomas, are
rare in the United States population but they may 
have a rising incidence
•	 The incidence of Klatskin tumors increases with age
and patients younger than 20 years of age are rare
•	 The only curative treatment for hilar
cholangiocarcinoma is margin-negative surgical 
resection
What the new findings are:
•	 The annual incidence ofKlatskin tumors has actually
declined in the United States over the past decade
•	 Even though surgery is the preferred treatment,
only a minority (26.8%) of patients are amenable 
to surgical resection, as they present in advanced 
stages with metastases
•	 These tumors continue to carry a poor prognosis,
with median survival duration measured in months
