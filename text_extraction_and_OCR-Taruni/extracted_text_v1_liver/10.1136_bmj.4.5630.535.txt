Summary: In view of the extreme sensitivity of the
human liver to ischaemic damage, the organization of
clinical transplantation is of necessity complicated. From
our preliminary experience of five human liver allografts
we feel that active collaboration between hospitals is
essential in order to practise human liver transplantation.
It is unnecessary and undesirable to interfere in any way
with potential liver donors. Nevertheless, the nature of
the surgical technique requires that the liver is cooled
within 15 minutes of death if satisfactory function is to
result in the grafted organ.
This report describes technical difficulties that were
encountered which can limit successful liver transplanta.
tion. The first patient was in severe liver failure and had
an accessory liver graft in the splenic fossa after splenectomy. This liver suffered irreversible ischaemic
damage, which led to an uncontrollable haemorrhagic
state with exsanguination that resulted in death the day
after operation. The second patient, a 10-month-old
infant with biliary atresia and liver failure, died from
cardiac arrest shortly after the operation.
The remaining three transplants developed good
initial function. One patient survived 11 weeks, and one
has returned to work
Introduction
The liver can be transplanted to the normal anatomical position
(orthotopic) or to an abnormal situation (heterotopic). A variety
of heterotopic techniques have been described (Starzl et al.,
1966), but none is ideal. It is difficult to accommodate an
extra liver in the abdomen in such a way that it receives arterial
and portal blood and drains hepatic venous blood and bile.
There is a danger that the multiple anastomoses will be kinked
or otherwise compromised. Orthotopic liver transplantation
requires preliminary hepatectomy of the recipient (Moore et
al., 1960; Starzl et al., 1960). This provides the liver with
normal anatomical surroundings, and revascularization and
biliary drainage are straightforward.
Renal function can be replaced artificially by dialysis, which
is used to support the patient before and if necessary after renal
transplantation. There is no comparable method of replacing
liver function. The two categories of fatal liver disease for
which transplantation may be indicated are progressive liver
failure with cirrhosis and primary malignant tumours of the

liver. If the liver is malignant then hepatectomy is an obvious
prerequisite, but with non-malignant progressive liver disease
there are theoretical advantages in leaving the residual function
of the patient's own liver and avoiding a dangerous and difficult hepatectomy. The unsatisfactory surgical features of
heterotopic liver transplantation may, however, make this an
unwise choice.
If the liver is left at 37° C. without a blood supply for more
than 15 minutes serious damage is likely to occur. The liver
cell necrosis results in impairment of function and also appears
to be responsible for the uncontrollable haemorrhagic syndrome
that occurred in our first case. To prevent this damage it is
therefore essential to cool the liver within 15 minutes of death,
by infusion of a chilled innocuous fluid through the portal vein.
If this is followed by a cold plasma/bicarbonate/dextrose
solution the liver can be kept at 4° C. with little deterioration
for two hours (Schalm, 1968). Slow deterioration does, however, occur, and, since hepatectomy of the recipient can be an
extremely difficult and time-consuming operation, longer preservation is desirable. The most satisfactory method so far
described by Brettschneider et al. (1968) utilizes hyperbaric
oxygen, hypothermia, and continuous perfusion with diluted
blood. With this technique excellent preservation of canine
livers for eight hours has been achieved, and an identical method
has been used to preserve human livers for transplantation by
Starzl et al. (1968a). Before laparotomy of the donor, while
the preservation apparatus is being prepared, it may be helpful
to cool the cadaver by means of a heart-lung machine with a
refrigeration unit (Marchioro et al., 1963).
Organization
It follows from the above remarks that the requirements for
a clinical liver transplantation are as follows: a recipient with
fatal liver disease at a terminal stage, but who is nevertheless fit
enough to withstand a major and prolonged operation, and a
donor whose liver can be cooled within 15 minutes of death.
It is not surprising that clinical liver transplantation has been
slow in developing. Of five heterotopic liver transplants in
man the longest survival was 35 days (Starzl et al., 1967).
Previous to July 1967 nine orthotopic liver transplants were
performed in man and the longest survival was 23 days. Since
that time the clinical liver transplantation programme at Denver
has had more success (Starzl et al., 1968a, 1968b). Of 17 transplants in 16 patients the longest survivor was more than a year,
the patient eventually dying from secondary deposits of his
original primary hepatoma. Of the seven patients surviving at
the present time, one has received a second liver transplant
after the first had been rejected and removed (Starzl, Brettschneider, and Porter, personal communication).

Liver Transplantation in Man-Calne and Williams
In view of the major organizational requirements for a
successful liver transfer it is necessary for there to be a period
of warning during which arrangements can be made. The
recipient should therefore have sufficient residual liver function
to permit him to wait for the availability of a transplant. The
most suitable donors are cases in which resuscitation has been
performed, but where irreversible brain damage has occurred
and a decision has been made, quite irrespective of any transplantation considerations, to cease resuscitation. When recovery
is impossible it is customary to cease artificial ventilation and
support of the circulation. This was true before the development
of organ transplantation, and we feel it is unnecessary to
modify the procedure in any way for the purposes of transplantation. The medical staff caring for the patient should
not be involved in the transplantation operation. After resuscitation has been abandoned no procedures are started on the
donor until it is clear that there is no spontaneous respiration
or heart beat, and death has been confirmed by independent
medical staff, Liver transplantation can then be performed
entirely within the confines of long-established ethical medical
treatment. All that is necessary is for the doctors who have
decided to stop resuscitation to inform the transplantation team,
who will then be prepared.
Since the availability of suitable donors in any one institution
is limited, it is felt that if clinical liver transplantation is to be
developed in the United Kingdom it will be necessary for hospitals to collaborate. We do not feel justified in moving a
potential donor from one hospital to another for the purposes
of organ transplantation. Instead, we move the transplant team
and the recipient to the same hospital as the donor. A close
liaison has been established between Addenbrooke's Hospital,
Cambridge, and King's College Hospital, London, where there
are complementary interests in liver transplantation and liver
disease. It is proposed to undertake a definitive programme of
liver transplantation, collaborating with other hospitals where
this is possible.
This report summarizes certain technical aspects of our first
five cases. The full clinical details of Cases 3 and 4 are given
in an accompanying article at p. 541 (Calne et al., 1968).
Reports of the anaesthesia and tissue typing are in preparation.
Case 1
A 47-year-old man was admitted to Addenbrooke's Hospital on
23 May 1967 with gastrointestinal bleeding. He had a past history
of alcoholism which had led to liver failure, with ascites and periods
of coma.
On examination he was pale, jaundiced, and ill-looking. The
liver was not palpable, but the spleen could be felt below the left
costal margin. There was marked ascites. Haemoglobin was 11.3 g./
100 ml., white blood cell count 5,400/cu. mmn., platelets 60,000/
cu.mm., prothrombin ratio 17-13, and bilirubin 2 mg/100 ml. (1.6
mg./100 ml. conjugated). Spleno-portogram showed large gastrooesophageal varices. Serum albumin varied between 1.9 and 2.3 g./
100 ml. The patient had had two previous attacks of haematemesis
and melaena requiring transfusion and had been comatose for one
week. He recovered from coma and became fully alert. In view of
his continued gastrointestinal bleeding, low albumin, clinical jaundice, and a previous history of coma, it was felt that any surgical
procedure aimed at reducing portal venous pressure would result in
irreversible coma. His liver disease was considered to be beyond
conventional therapy. The possibility of hepatic transplantation
was discussed with the patient, who was anxious that this should be
tried.
The donor was a 50-year-old woman who died from a head
injury. She was brought into hospital dead and attempts at resuscitation were made for half an hour. There was no response to the
resuscitative efforts.
Via a midline abdominal incision the superior mesenteric vein
was cannulated and perfused with 1 litre of chilled balanced salt
solution. An incision was made in the right common iliac vein to
allow egress of perfusate. While perfusion was in progress the liver
BRImSH
MEDICAL JOURNAL
was rem. ved and put into a plastic bag surrounded by cold perfusion
fluid. The hepatic artery was similarly perfused and the plastic bag
was surrounded with ice. This procedure was used in the four subsequent cases.
Before the start of perfusion there had been a period of one hour
in which the liver at 370 C. had been unperfused.
Recipient Operation
Under light general anaesthesia a left subcostal incision was made
and extended across the midline. Ascitic fluid was aspirated. The
spleen, which was extremely large, was removed. The liver was
taken out of the plastic bag at 11.30 a.m., three hours after the
death of the donor. It was rotated so that the hilus faced towards
the midline and it was placed in the splenic fossa, the shrunken
cirrhotic liver allowing room for the transplant. The gall bladder
faced anteriorly and the suprahepatic inferior vena cava faced
towards the renal vein. The anastomoses were performed as shown
in Fig. 1. The coeliac artery was anastomosed end-to-end to the
splenic; the superior mesenteric vein was anastomosed end-to-end
to the splenic vein, and the splenic vein of the transplant was
anastomosed to an accessory splenic vein, which lay in the tail of
the pancreas. Clamps were removed from the splenic vessels and
blood was allowed to perfuse the liver. The infrahepatic inferior
vena cava was ligated. The suprahepatic inferior vena cava was
anastomosed end-to-side to the left renal vein. The liver appeared
to perfuse satisfactorily. The common bile duct was ligated and
the gall bladder was anastomosed to the end of a Roux loop of
jejunum. The anastomoses took an hour, so that the total ischaemia
time was four hours. The wound was closed in layers with drainage. Though no heparin had been given after operation there was
a continuous steady loss of blood from the drains. Two hours after
the operation bleeding became more profuse; blood oozed from the
wound and around the intravenous infusion. The blood clotted
and then underwent complete fibrinolysis after about 20 minutes.
The patient did not recover consciousness.
FIG. 1.-Diagram of operative procedure in Case 1, showing heterotopic liver allograft in the splenic bed.
The wound was reopened and bleeding was seen to be coming
from the whole operative site and particularly from the caval anastomosis, where additional sutures were inserted. Haemorrhage
continued in spite of the administration of aminocaproic acid, intravenous fibrinogen, and fresh blood. In all, 23 litres of blood were
transfused. The patient died at 5.30 next morning.
The biopsy taken shortly after transplantation of the liver showed
marked degenerative changes in many of the liver cells (Special Plate,
Fig. 2). Necropsy revealed the typical changes of severe portal
cirrhosis of the patient's own liver with large gastro-oesophageal
varices. The transplanted liver was severely congested. The anastomoses were all patent, though the inferior vena caval anastomosis
was narrowed by the additional sutures. Histology of the transplant showed congestion, haemorrhage, and areas of liver necrosis.
Some liver cells were reasonably well preserved. There was n&,
regular zonal distribution of these changes.
Comment.-This liver was removed from a cadaver after
irreversible ischaemic damage had occurred, and this led to an

uncontrollable haemorrhagic state. The heterotopic situation
of the liver was not satisfactory and congestion of the liver at
necropsy indicated poor venous drainage.
Case 2
A child of 10 months was admitted to Addenbrooke's Hospital
on 11 June 1968 with jaundice which had developed shortly after
birth. Laparotomy at the age of 2 months confirmed the diagnosis
of biliary atresia. During the two months preceding admission the
child had developed biliary cirrhosis with ascites and was considered
to be unsuitable for any further treatment.
Haemoglobin was 8.6/100 ml., bilirubin 8.2 mg./100 ml. (5.7
mg. conjugated), total protein 6.2 g./100 ml. with a moderate
increa3e in a2- and y-globulin.
On examination he was extremely jaundiced, with enormous
abdominal distension, dilated superficial veins coursing over the
anterior abdominal wall, and gross ascites. The liver was markedly
enlarged. The spleen was just palpable. An umbilical hernia was
present.
It was felt that the prognosis was hopeless, and the parents
requested that an attempt should be made to perform a liver transplant.
The donor was a child of 2 who had died as a result of upper
respiratory tract infection which led to cardiac and respiratory
arrest. The time of death was 4.35 p.m. Cardiac massage and
artificial ventilation were attempted without any result. At 4.57
p.m. a transverse upper abdominal incision was made, a cannula
was inserted into the superior mesenteric vein, and the liver was
perfused with 1 litre of cold Hartmann's solution containing 2,000 i.u.
of heparin and then with 500 ml. of plasma/bicarbonate/glucose
solution' (Schalm, 1968). An incision was made into the inferior
vena cava to allow the perfusate to escape. An accessory right
hepatic artery was found to be arising from the superior mesenteric
artery; this was preserved together with the other vessels and the
bile ducts.
Recipient Operation
A bilateral subcostal incision was made. Dilated anastomotic
veins in the anterior abdominal wall were individually ligated and
divided. Ascitic fluid was aspirated. Dense adhesions between the
bowel, the parietes, and the liver were divided. The liver was huge,
green, and embossed with bile cysts; there were large lymph nodes
at the hilus. Removal of the diseased liver was time-consuming.
The liver was skeletonized until it was attached only by its vascular
connexions. The portal vein and inferior vena cava were temporarily occluded, and since this produced no deterioration in the
general condition of the patient no vascular shunts were used.
Hepatectomy was completed at 7.35 p.m., when the donor liver was
removed from ice.
The vena cava was anastomosed to the vena cava above the liver,
and the portal vein was anastomosed to the portal vein end-to-end.
The clamp was removed from the portal vein at 7.55 p.m. and
blood was allowed to perfuse the liver. After 10 ml. of blood
had been discharged from the inferior vena cava below the liver
this vessel was clamped and the vascular clamp was removed from
the inferior vena cava above the liver. The aorta was mobilized
and cross-clamped, a Carrel patch with the coeliac artery of the
donor was anastomosed end-to-side to the aorta of the recipient.
The superior mesenteric artery of the donor was anastomosed endto-end to the recipient's hepatic artery and the inferior vena cava
was anastomosed end-to-end to the inferior vena cava below the
liver. All anastomoses were completed by 8.50 p.m. The bile duct
was ligated and the gall bladder was anastomosed to a Roux loop
of jejunum (Fig. 3). The liver was rather pale and blotchy and
did not appear to be perfusing well, but all anastomoses looked
satisfactory. The falciform ligament of the transplant was sutured
to that of the recipient. No heparin was used, 4 mg. of fibrinogen
was given intravenously, haemostasis was achieved, and the wound
was closed in layers. Intravenous dextrose and bicarbonate were
given.
Preservation fluid containing 400 ml. of reconstituted human plasma,
10 ml. of 2% procaine, 8 ml. of 5% glucose, and 20 ml. of 1.4%
sodium bicarbonate.

The child's condition improved at the end of the operation; he
was breathing spontaneously and regained consciousness. Half an
hour after the end of the operation there was a sudden cardiac and
respiratory arrest, the cause of which was not determined. Attempts
at resuscitation failed. At necropsy no cause of death could be
found. All anastomoses of the transplant were patent. Microscopy of the transplant showed slight centrilobular necrosis of
many lobules and oedema of the portal tracts with dilatation of
lymphatics. There was a slight neutrophil infiltrate of the hepatic
capsule. Most of the liver parenchyma was well preserved.
FIG. 3.-Diagram of operative procedure
in Case 2.
Comment.-It was felt that the extensive operative procedure
in an exceedingly ill child was too great for it to withstand, but
the liver preservation appeared to be adequate.
Case 3
A 46-year-old woman was admitted to Addenbrooke's Hospital
on 7 February 1968 with a primary cholangiocarcinoma which had
caused obstructive jaundice and gastrointestinal haemorrhage.
Chlorambucil treatment for her tumour resulted in marrow depression and septicaemia. Full details are reported elsewhere (Calne
et al., 1968).
Though in an extremely ill state, the patient was most anxious
to have a liver transplant, and in spite of persisting marrow damage
liver transplantation was performed.
The donor was a 5-year-old child who had died as a result of
mumps encephalitis. Death occurred at 4.50 p.m. A transverse
abdominal incision was made and the superior mesenteric vein was
perfused with cold heparinized Ringer's solution at 5.05 p.m. An
incision was made in the right common iliac vein to allow egress
of perfusate. The perfusate was changed to plasma bicarbonate
dextrose solution. Similar perfusate was used in the hepatic artery.
Recipient Operation
A bilateral subcostal incision was made. The liver was found
to be huge, with deposits of growth palpable in both lobes but no
ascites and no evidence of growth outside the liver. There were
dense vascular adhesions between the porta hepatis, omentum, and
duodenum. The liver was skeletonized until it was attached only
by its vascular connexions. During the dissection the patient's blood
pressure tended to fall, probably owing to manipulation of the liver
causing embarrassment of respiration and cardiac action and intermittent obstruction of the vena cava. The patient was systemically
heparinized with 10,000 units of heparin. The portal vein was
clamped at 6.08 p.m. and portal venous blood was shunted to the
right internal jugular vein (Fig. 4). It was felt that the inferior
vena cava of the recipient was much too large to be anastomosed
to the vena cava of the small donor liver; therefore the liver was
filleted off the vena cava, clamping the main hepatic vein and
ligating all other branches. The malignant liver was removed at
6.20 p.m. and the donor liver was removed from the ice at
6.40 p.m.

The suprahepatic inferior vena cava was anastomosed end-to-end
to the main hepatic vein. The portal vein was anastomosed end-toend to the portal. There was considerable discrepancy in size, and
plication was necessary in order to complete the anastomosis. The
clamp was removed from the portal vein at 7.11 p.m. and blood was
allowed to perfuse the liver. After 30 ml. of blood had been discharged from the inferior vena cava below the liver this vessel was
ligated and the clamp on the hepatic vein was removed. The
coeliac artery with a rim of aorta was anastomosed end-to-end to

continuous 4/0 chromic catgut. The anastomosis lay in a satisfactory position, afid bile was seen to be produced from the liver at
this stage. The common bile duct was then ligated. The falciform
ligament was sutured to the diaphragm, and a minute liver biopsy
was taken. Yates drains were brought out of the lateral extremities
of the wound, which was closed in layers. Every attempt was made
to secure haemostasis, but the whole of the operation site was oozing
blood at the end of the operation and the patient felt cold. The
heparin was reversed with protamine. Fibrinogen was given, and
the patient was warmed with blankets. Significant bleeding from
the wound ceased in the subsequent two hours. During the operation the patient received 7 litres of blood, 100 ml. of 20% mannitol,
and intravenous dextrose and bicarbonate solutions.
Biopsy of the transplanted liver shortly after revascularization
showed well-preserved liver cells. Initial function of the liver was
considered to be good (Fig. 6). The patient rapidly regained
consciousness. Full postoperative details are recorded elsewhere
(Calne et al., 1968).

the divided hepatic artery of the recipient (Fig. 5). This anastomosis
was completed at 7.23 p.m., and on release of the arterial clamp
an excellent pulse was felt throughout the length of the hepatic
artery of the donor and the liver changed from a dark red colour to
bright salmon pink with a normal consistency. The diameter of the
common bile duct of the recipient was 0.7 cm., while that of the
donor was 0.3 cm. An end-to-end anastomosis was felt to be
surgically unsatisfactory. The alternative of anastomosing the gall
bladder to the bowel was felt to be undesirable because of the danger
of ascending cholangitis. Accordingly the gall bladder was mobilized
from its bed.

The patient died 11 weeks after operation following partial infarction of the liver. This appeared to be caused by a clot arising in
the recipient hepatic artery, where it had been clamped during
the operation.
Case 4
A 41-year-old man was admitted to King's College Hospital on
23 September 1968 with a primary liver cell cancer. Full details
are reported elsewhere (Calne et al., 1968). There was massive
enlargement of the liver, but the patient was not jaundiced and was
ambulant. In view of the hopeless prognosis he was anxious to
have a liver transplant.
The donor was a 13-year-old child who had died as a result of a
head injury. Death occurred at 11.27 p.m. A bilateral subcostal
incision was made, and the superior mesenteric vein was perfused
with 2 litres of cold heparinized Hartmann's solution followed by
200 ml. of plasma bicarbonate dextrose solution. The cold infusion
began at 11.40 p.m. An incision was made in the right common
iliac vein to allow egress of perfusate. An accessory right hepatic
artery was found to be arising from the superior mesenteric artery.
This was preserved together with the other vessels and the bile ducts.
The liver was immersed in cold saline in a bowl surrounded with ice
at 12.35 a.m.
Recipient Operation
A bilateral subcostal incision was made. The liver was grossly
enlarged, and there were numerous vascular adhesions between the
liver, parietes, and surrounding viscera. These were ligated and
divided. Huge veins were coursing over the surface of the liver,
which bled on touch. During mobilization of the liver bleeding
occurred whenever the venous outflow was obstructed. There was
no evidence of extrahepatic spread of tumour, but the whole of the

left lobe of the liver was replaced by tumour and multiple small
tumour deposits were scattered through the right lobe. During the
final stages of the skeletonization of the liver the infrahepatic vena
cava was divided; both ends were controlled and ligated. The
patient's systolic blood pressure fell to 60 mm. Hg, but gradually
rose with replacement of blood. The hepatectomy was completed
at 1.00 a.m., when the donor liver was removed from the ice. The
vena cava was anastomosed to the vena cava above the liver; the
portal vein was anastomosed to the portal vein end-to-end. The
clamp was removed from the portal vein at 1.26 a.m., and blood
was allowed to perfuse the liver. After 30 ml. of blood had been
discharged from the inferior vena cava below the liver this vessel
was clamped and the suprahepatic caval clamp was removed. The
liver rapidly assumed a satisfactory colour of pale pink and normal
consistency. The coeliac artery was anastomosed end-to-side to the
proximal hepatic artery of the recipient, a Carrel patch being used.
The donor superior mesenteric artery was anastomosed end-to-end
to the cut distal hepatic artery (Fig. 7). The clamp was removed
from the hepatic artery at 1.55 a.m., and the infrahepatic vena caval
anastomosis was made end-to-end.
FIG. 7.-Operative procedure in Case 4. The long
arm of the T tube emerges through the recipient's
common bile duct.
The common bile duct was anastomosed with 4/0 interrupted
catgut sutures end-to-end over the upper limb of a rubber T-tube,
which was brought out through the recipient's common duct below
the anastomosis. Bile was seen to be produced by the liver at this
stage. The T-tube was brought out through a stab incision.
Haemostasis was achieved, the falciform ligament was sutured to the
diaphragm, and a minute liver biopsy was taken. Two grammes
of ampicillin dissolved in 50 ml. of saline was introduced under the
diaphragm and in the subhepatic space. Yates drains were brought
out by stab incisions through both flanks from both subdiaphragmatic
areas and from the subhepatic space of the right side. The wound
was closed in layers.
The patient's general condition at the end of the operation was
good and he woke immediately from the anaesthetic, but continuous
haemorrhage occurred from the drainage site on the right side, and
after 12 hours the abdomen was re-explored. One litre of clotted
blood was found in the peritoneal cavity; this was removed. No
bleeding could be found at any point in relation to the liver or
elsewhere. The wound was closed, and haemorrhage was then seen
to be coming from the drain site in the right flank. This wound
was opened further, and an artery in the subcutaneous tissue was
found to be bleeding; this was oversewn, and other small vessels
near by were clamped. Bleeding then ceased, and the patient's
general condition became excellent. He had received mannitol,
bicarbonate, dextrose, and 22 litres of blood. The transplant biopsy
taken shortly after revascularization showed well-preserved liver
parenchyma (Special Plate, Fig. 8).
The subsequent postoperative course is recorded elsewhere (Calne
et al., 1968). At the time of writing the patient is clinically well
and has returned to work, having been discharged from hospital
on the seventeenth postoperative day.

Case 5
A 46-year-old man was admitted to King's College Hospital on
27 October 1968 with a primary cholangiocarcinoma which had
caused obstructive jaundice. In view of the hopeless prognosis he
was anxious to have a liver transplant.
The donor was a 64-year-old man who had died as a result of
a head injury. Death occurred at 10.26 p.m. A bilateral subcostal incision was made, and the superior mesenteric vein was
perfused with 2 litres of cold heparinized Hartmann's solution followed by 200 ml. of plasma/bicarbonate/dextrose solution. Cold
infusion began at 10.30 p.m. An incision was made in the right
common iliac vein to allow egress of perfusate. The liver was
removed and placed in cold saline at 11.15 p.m.
Recipient Operation
A bilateral subcostal incision was made. The liver was grossly
enlarged, but there was no evidence of growth on the surface of
the liver or elsewhere in the peritoneal cavity. There were dense
adhesions in the region of the aditus. The common bile duct was
extremely fibrotic, and it was felt that it would be unsuitable for
anastomosis. It was therefore divided and ligated just above the
duodenum. Some purulent material discharged from the hilus of
the liver; this was cultured. Hepatectomy was completed at
11.15 p.m., when the donor liver was removed from the ice.
The vena cava was anastomosed to the vena cava above the
liver, and the portal vein was anastomosed to the portal vein endto-end and blood was allowed to perfuse the liver. After 30 ml.
of blood had been discharged from the inferior vena cava below the
liver the vessel was clamped and the suprahepatic vena caval clamp
was removed. The liver rapidly assumed a satisfactory colour of
pale pink and normal consistency. The coeliac artery of the donor
was anastomosed to the hepatic artery of the recipient end-to-end.
The clamp was removed from the hepatic artery at 12.15 a.m., and
there was an excellent arterial pulse up to the hilus of the liver, with
no evidence of kinking or obstruction (Fig. 9). The infrahepatic
vena caval anastomosis was made end-to-end, and the fundus of the
gall bladder was anastomosed to a Roux loop of jejunum which was
brought up through the mesocolon. There was considerable bleeding
from the jejunal wall in spite of the fact that diathermy had been
used to open it, but it appeared that the all-coats catgut layer had
stopped the bleeding. Two grammes of ampicillin dissolved in
50 ml. of saline was introduced under the diaphragm and in the
subhepatic space. A Yates drain was brought out through the
right extremity of the main wound, which was closed in layers.

540 30 November 1968 Liver Transplantation in Man-Calne and I1illiams MEDITALJSHRNAL
was therefore performed, and the bleeding was found to be coming
from the jejunal side of the cholecystduodenostomy. The bleeding
points were individually ligated and the anastomosis was redone.
The transplant biopsy taken shortly after revascularization showed
a well-preserved liver. He received, in all, 7 litres of blood, 4 g. of
fibrinogen, and 200 mg. of hydrocortisone in addition to mannitol,
bicarbonate, and dextrose. No heparin or protamine was given.
The postoperative course was complicated by further gastrointestinal
haemorrhage, jaundice, and peritonitis. Death from sepsis occurred
after three weeks.
Discussion
These five cases allow several conclusions to be made. The
irreversible ischaemic damage in Case 1 leading to an uncontrollable haemorrhagic syndrome reinforces the importance of
reducing the warm ischaemic time to a minimum of 15 minutes
between death of the donor and cooling of the liver. In the
subsequent four cases the donor liver was cooled within 15
minutes of death, and in Cases 3-5, with total ischaemic times
(from death of donor until revascularization with portal blood)
of 141, 106, and 94 minutes, excellent preservation was achieved
by the simple cooling that was used (Schalm, 1968).
The extremely serious liver failure in Case 1 by the time the
transplantation was performed made the likelihood of success
unlikely even with a well-preserved and satisfactorily transplanted heterotopic liver. Though the splenic fossa provided
room for the liver transplant, and the anastomoses appeared
satisfactory at the time of the operation, the venous drainage
was inadequate, and the other anastomoses might have been
compromised if the patient had adopted an upright posture. We
feel that the orthotopic site is preferable.
In Cases 1, 2, and 5 biliary drainage was to a Roux loop of
jejunum. This was felt to be preferable to cholecystduodenostomy, though less desirable than biliary drainage, which retains
the patient's own sphincter of Oddi, as in Cases 3 and 4.
The cause of death in Case 2 was not apparent; however, the
child was extremely frail and ill, and the recent rapid development of ascites indicated terminal liver failure.
In Case 3 there were technical difficulties in fitting a small
child's liver into an adult. The infarction of the transplant,
however, was not due to the discrepancy in size, since the
arterial thrombus arose on the recipient hepatic artery where the
vascular clamp had been applied. The cholecystcholedochostomy appeared satisfactory and well vascularized at the time
of operation.
One patient (Case 4) was less ill than the others. The hepatectomy was particularly difficult, but he withstood the operation extremely well.
We are in full agreement with Starzl et al. (1968b) that in
humans it is unnecessary to shunt blood from the inferior caval
and portal systems when the patient is anhepatic. It is, however, desirable to have two intravenous infusions set up in the
superior vena caval system before clamping the inferior vena
cava, so that the return of blood to the heart can be augmented
should there be a precipitous fall in blood pressure.
At present we believe the most suitable cases for liver transplantation are patients with primary hepatic or biliary tract
carcinoma and biliary atresia. Some idea of the number
of such cases present in this country was obtained by
Terblanche and Riddell (1967) from an analysis of the Registrar
General's Statistical Review of England and Wales for the year
1964. There were 429 deaths from primary hepatic carcinoma
and 1,070 deaths from primary biliary carcinoma (gall bladder
and bile duct) for all age groups, with corresponding figures
for those dying between 0 and 60 years of 145 and 195. Orthotopic transplantation of the liver is a major surgical procedure,
and it is unlikely that patients over the age of 60 will often be
considered, in view of the high incidence of associated disease,
particularly of the cardiovascular system. About 30% of
primary hepatic tumours may have distant metastases by the
time of diagnosis, and perhaps another third of such patients
are treatable by hepatic lobectomy. Carcinomas of the hepatic
and common bile duct are often slowly growing and metastasize
late, so that about 130 to 160 patients from these two groups
may be suitable for hepatic transplantation each year.
Biliary atresia, though rare, is another condition with an
almost uniformly poor prognosis, in which the defect can
rarely be corrected surgically. In the same year in the 0-60
age group there were 490 deaths from cirrhosis, 106 from acute
viral hepatitis, and 54 from acute hepatic failure due to other
causes, including drugs. All these are potential recipients, but
the metabolic derangements of hepatic coma, the portal hypertension, and the frequently attendant renal impairment usually
present in these patients are likely to increase the operative and
immediate postoperative mortality considerably. Operating on
patients with acute viral hepatitis may also carry grave dangers
to the surgical and nursing teams.
With regard to the availability of donors in 1964 there were
1,135 deaths from subarachnoid haemorrhage and primary brain
tumour and 2,478 from motor-vehicle accidents with a fractured
skull or head injury in the 0-45 age group (Terblanche and
Riddell, 1967). In both these groups some of the patients are
likely to be maintained on respirators until the final demise. The
patients dying in the older age groups carry a higher risk of
their livers containing an occult secondary carcinoma. Despite
an apparent adequate supply of donors, there will be major
problems in organization for the individual patient, as already
outlined. These problems will persist until organ preservation
techniques have been developed, which will enable the donor
liver to be preserved for periods of more than two to three
hours.
Though the indications for liver transplantation will be
widened in the future, at the present time the most suitable
cases are adults with fatal hepatic disease who are too ill for
an independent existence outside hospital, but have not yet
reached a moribund stage.
We wish to thank our medical, nursing, and technical colleagues
who have helped to initiate this transplantation programme. We
have had most generous assistance from so many people that it
would be invidious to mention individual names. We are particularly indebted to the anaesthetics, bacteriological, biochemnical,
pathological, haematological, radiological, and medical illustration
departments of Addenbrooke's Hospital and King's College Hospital.
We thank Mrs. M. Allen for preparing the drawings.
