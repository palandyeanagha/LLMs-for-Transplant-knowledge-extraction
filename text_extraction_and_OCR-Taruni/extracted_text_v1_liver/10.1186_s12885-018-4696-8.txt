Abstract
Background: As stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has shown to be effective and safe in patients with
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the aim of our propensity score matched analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of
SBRT in comparison to transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) in intermediate and advanced HCC.
Methods: Patients treated with TACE (n = 367) and patients allocated to SBRT (n = 35) were enrolled in this study.
Propensity score matching was performed to adjust for differences in baseline and tumor characteristics of TACE
and SBRT patients. Local tumor control (LC) 1 year after treatment, overall survival (OS) and 1-year mortality were
assessed.
Results: Patients treated with SBRT have received more prior HCC treatments compared to TACE patients. The LC
1 year after treatment in the unmatched cohort was 74.4% for TACE patients compared to 84.8% in the SBRT group.
Patients treated with TACE showed significantly improved OS (17.0 months vs. 9.0 months, p = 0.016). After propensity
score matching, the LC in the TACE (n = 70) and SBRT (n = 35) group was comparable (82.9% vs. 84.8%, p = 0.805) and
OS did not differ significantly in both groups.
Conclusions: SBRT after prior HCC therapy in selected patients shows comparable LC at 1 year, OS and 1-year
mortality compared to patients treated with TACE.

Background
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is often diagnosed in
intermediate or advanced tumor stages and treatment
options are limited [1, 2]. According to the Barcelona
Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) classification [1, 3], patients
with intermediate HCC (BCLC B) are treated with
transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) [4] and there
is growing evidence that patients with BCLC C without
complete portal vein thrombosis (PVT) and even with
extrahepatic metastases may also benefit from TACE [5].
During the last years, stereotactic body radiation therapy
(SBRT) has emerged as another local ablative non-invasive
treatment approach in patients with HCC [6–8]. It has
been reported that SBRT can achieve high rates of local
tumor control with acceptable toxicity in patients with
HCC, also in carefully selected patients with impaired liver
function [6, 9]. Although these reports have shown that
SBRT is a feasible and well-tolerated treatment option for
patients with HCC, there is no consensus in which setting
SBRT should be used. SBRT was also used to bridge to
liver transplantation as an alternative treatment option to
TACE with favorable results [10–12]. However, there are
no studies evaluating the efficacy of SBRT compared to
TACE in patients with intermediate HCC outside the

transplantation setting. In order to analyze this important
clinical issue, we performed a single-center, retrospective
analysis by using propensity score matching focusing
on local tumor control, overall survival (OS) and
1-year-mortality.
Methods
Selection of patients
The TACE cohort consisted of patients who had been
treated at the University Hospital Freiburg (Germany)
between January 2003 and January 2015. In summary,
1030 HCC patients were included in an HCC database.
Of these patients, 407 were initially treated with TACE.
Patients with extrahepatic metastases who had been
treated by TACE in an individual treatment approach
were excluded from this analysis. Further, we excluded
patients with BCLC A, who received TACE as a bridge to
surgery or liver transplantation. In summary, 367 patients
who have been treated with TACE were included in these
analyses.
The SBRT cohort consisted of 35 consecutive patients
with 49 HCC lesions who have been treated in the
Department of Radiation Oncology of the University
Hospital Freiburg (Germany) between 2012 and 2016
and which have partly been published elsewhere [6, 13]. Patients treated with SBRT who received prior TACE were
not included in the TACE group. Treatment decisions
were made at the dedicated institutional multidisciplinary HCC tumor board following institutional, national
and international guidelines. Typically, TACE was the
first-line treatment in patients without complete portal
vein thrombosis. SBRT was performed after TACE failure, as an alternative to systemic treatment with sorafenib
or after progression during sorafenib. Therefore, these patients have mainly received prior HCC therapy.
Definitions
HCC was staged using the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer
(BCLC) classification. Diagnosis of HCC was made according the current guidelines mainly by imaging (computer
tomography [CT] or dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic
resonance imaging [MRI]) when lesions showed the typical
arterial phase hyperenhancement and portal venous and/or
delayed washout [1, 3]. The number of focal hepatic lesions
and the maximum diameter as well as the presence of portal
vein thrombosis (PVT) were assessed. We summarized the
intrahepatic lesions in oligonodular (one or two intrahepatic
lesions) and in multifocal HCC (three or more lesions
or diffuse HCC growth pattern).
TACE procedure
TACE was performed using a selective or super-selective
approach. Intra-arterial infusion of the chemotherapeutic
agent and lipiodol was performed after having localized
the target lesion. Epirubicin or mitomycin were used as
chemotherapeutic agents. The chemotherapeutic agent
was not defined in the study protocol. The lipiodol infusion was stopped when intra-arterial stasis was observed in
the angiographic control. Further, gelatin sponge particles
or PVA particles were used for embolization. In 41 patients
(11.2%) drug-eluting beads TACE (DEB-TACE) was
performed.
SBRT techniques
In order to exactly define the radiation field, patients
were immobilized in supine position with a vacuum
cushion (BlueBAG BodyFIX, Innovative Technologies
Völp, Innsbruck, Austria) and underwent 4 dimensionalCT (4D CT, Brilliance CT Big Bore, Philips Medical
Systems, Cleveland, OH) as previously described [6, 13].
For the 4D acquisition (Mayo Clinic Respiratory feedback
system), we monitored breathing which was reduced with
an abdominal compression method. Lesions with contrast
enhancement in the arterial phase and with washout in
the venous phase and/or delayed phase including the portal vein thrombosis (PVT) were defined as gross tumor
volume (GTV). The internal target volume (ITV) was created to account for the extent and the position of the
tumor at all motion phases of the 4D-CT data set, and the
PTV a uniform expansion of 4 mm of the ITV. Further,
for using image guide radiotherapy (IGRT) lipiodol deposits from previous TACE sessions were used. In the absence of lipiodol as a marker, fiducial markers were
implanted before beginning of radiotherapy. The decision
for the numbers of fractions which were delivered to the
patients was based on the proximity to organs at risk such
as the stomach, the small intestine and the colon: In patients without a close proximity to these critical structures 3 fractions (3 × 12.5–15 Gy) were preferred. In
contrast, 12 fractions (12 × 4–5.5 Gy) were applied if there
was a close contact to the OARs and 5 fractions (5 × 7–
10 Gy) were used in case of intermediate closeness to the
OARs. On every treatment day, before starting radiation
therapy, a cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) with
oral contrast for visualizing the stomach and/or the duodenum was performed. Therefore, according to the
current location of the OARs, corrections in the radiation
fields were done on each treatment day if necessary.
In some lesions, dose constraints could not be achieved.
In these patients, we used a simultaneous integrated protection (SIP) dose prescription without reducing the dose
to the entire PVT [14]. During the study period, treatments
were either prescribed to the 60% and 80% encompassing
isodose (between 2007 and 2013) or according to ICRU
report 83 (after 2013). The prescribed doses were converted to equieffective doses for 2 Gy fractions (EQD2)
using an α/β ratio of 10 Gy and 3 Gy to account for
tumour and late reacting bowel tissue, respectively.

Radiological assessment
Radiological response was assessed every 3 months after
TACE or SBRT by using the mRECIST criteria (version 1.1)
[13]. Complete remission, partial remission or stable disease was summarized as local tumor control (LC). Patients
treated with TACE with detection of residual HCC within
the target lesion during follow-up imaging were allocated
to further TACE sessions. Concerning the LC at 1 year in
TACE patients we included the target lesions and reported
the response assessment at 1 year. Patients who received
more than one TACE session due to residual tumor disease
in the target lesion were not classified as non-responders.
For response assessment in patients treated with SBRT,
imaging was reviewed by comparing the treatment plan
for SBRT. By using this approach, we were able to define
if there was local recurrence or a new untreated tumor.
The LC of SBRT patients was assessed considering all
treated lesions (n = 49).
Statistical analyses
The present study was a retrospective observational study.
Baseline characteristics of the patients were analyzed
before TACE or SBRT. The primary outcome in our
analysis was LC 1 year after treatment and the secondary
outcome were overall survival (OS), 1-year-mortality and
toxicity. Continuous variables are reported as mean with
standard deviation whereas categorical variables are
expressed as frequencies and percentages (in parentheses)
unless stated otherwise. For continuous variables, differences were determined using Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney
and Kruskal-Wallis tests. We used non-parametric tests as
there was no Gaussian distribution of the data which was
confirmed by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test before starting the analyses. χ2 tests or Fisher’s Exact tests were used
for categorical variables. P values < 0.05 were considered
being significant.
Overall survival was defined from the day prior to
TACE or SBRT until death or last follow-up. At the end
of the observation period (01/07/2017) 358 patients
(89.1%) in the whole cohort and 86 patients (81.9%) in
the matched cohort had died. Survival was calculated
using Kaplan-Meier analyses. Differences in survival were
assessed using logRank tests.
As the outcome parameters may be influenced by
patient selection for either TACE or SBRT, we performed
propensity score matching. For development of the propensity score, we performed multivariable logistic regression model including the following parameters: ECOG 0
vs. 1/2, segmental portal vein thrombosis (PVT), hepatic
tumor expansion (oligonodular vs. multifocal), tumor size,
Child score and viral liver disease. Due to the large differences of the frequency of previous treatment between the
treatment groups, we were not able to adjust for this bias,
as this would have resulted in very small numbers in each
group after propensity score matching. After the propensity score has been established, we preformed 2:1
matching. For matching we used the nearest-neighbour
matching method with a calliper with of 0.01 without
replacement. Standardized differences were calculated in
order to assess post-hoc balance [15]. The standardized
differences before and after matching are presented in the
supplementary file.
Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS (version
24.0, IBM, New York, USA) and GraphPad Prism
(version 6, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).
Results
Patient characteristics
Baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 1. In
the TACE cohort there were significantly more patients
with viral liver disease compared to the SBRT cohort
(31.1% vs. 11.4%, p = 0.018). Patients treated with SBRT
presented with more advanced tumor disease compared
to patients with TACE as they were more often classified as
BCLC C (18.5% vs. 31.4%, p = 0.046). 60.8% of the patients
treated with TACE had multifocal HCC compared to 83.0%
of the patients in the SBRT group (p = 0.010). Only 5
patients (1.3%) in the TACE group had been treated before
study inclusion compared to 83.0% in the SBRT group
(p < 0.001). SBRT patients presented with a higher Child
score compared to TACE patients (5.9 ± 1.3 vs.8.4 ± 7.1,
p = 0.001). Technical data of SBRT are summarized in
Table 1.
Local tumor control at 1 year, OS and 1-year mortality in
patients treated with TACE or SBRT
In patients treated with TACE the LC at 1 year was
74.4% compared to 84.8% in patients treated with SBRT
(p = 0.146). There was a trend to a better LC in patients
treated with SBRT (Table 3). Patients with TACE had a
median OS of 17.0 [14.4–19.6] months compared to 9.0
[6.7–11.3] months in SBRT patients (p = 0.016) (Fig. 1a).
1-year-mortality was higher in patients treated with
SBRT compared to TACE patients but did not reach statistical significance (38.4% vs. 53.1%, p = 0.073, Table 3).
Toxicity
The most common toxicity in patients treated with
TACE was abdominal pain (n = 118, 32.2%), fever (n = 84,
22.9%) and nausea and vomiting (n = 51, 14.0%). These
complications developed shortly after TACE and were
explained by a postembolization syndrome. Thirteen
patients (3.5%) developed hematoma after puncture of
the femoral artery for angiography during the TACE
procedure. Three patients (0.8%) developed liver abscess
after TACE which was treated by insertion of a percutaneous drain and antibiotic treatment.
Bettinger et al. BMC Cancer (2018) 18:807 Page 3 of 9

The adverse events of the SBRT patients included in
this study have partly been published in previous studies
[6, 13]. Three of these patients developed gastric ulcer
bleeding, three, four and 5 months after treatment.
These patients were treated with proton pump inhibitors (2 patients, CTC grade 2) and transfusion (1 patient, grade CTC 3). Importantly, the patient who
developed CTC grade 3 gastroduodenitis had previously
been treated with SBRT for another HCC lesion
4 months ago. Liver-associated toxicity with a deterioration of liver function assessed by an increase of the Child
score was observed in 4 patients mainly with a small
increase of the Child score (Child B7 to B8 and Child A6
to B7, Child A5 to A6). Only one patients showed an
increase of two points of the Child score (Child A6 to B8)
which was attributed to RILD. But this patient fully recovered from this deterioration of liver function and died
9 months after SBRT due to renal failure which was not
attributed to treatment. The patient with an increase of
the Child score from A5 to A6 after SBRT developed
further hepatic decompensation without HCC progression
and died 4 months after SBRT. One patient developed a
necrotic abscess of the liver due to a dislocation of an
indwelling Pigtail-catheter of the bile duct after stentexchange which was surgically managed and was not
related to the SBRT.
Propensity score matching
As treatment allocation for TACE or SBRT is biased due
to different patient and tumor characteristics, we performed
propensity score matching to adjust for the imbalance
concerning these factors. Multivariable logistic regression

(Additional file 1: Table S1) analysis was performed and 105
patients after 2:1 matching (70 patients in the TACE group
and 35 patients in the SBRT group) with comparable
patients and tumor characteristics were identified (Table 2).
In the matched cohort, the LC at 1 year in the TACE
group was 82.9% compared to 84.8% (p = 0.805, Table 3).
With regards to the OS in both cohorts, patients treated
with TACE had similar OS compared to patients treated
with SBRT (11.0 [5.9–16.1] months for TACE patients
vs. 9.0 [6.7–11.3] months in SBRT patients, p = 0.492,
Fig. 1b). 1-year-mortality was 52.9% in the TACE cohort
compared to 53.1% in the SBRT group (p = 0.989, Table 3).
Local tumor control and 1-year-mortality in patients with
BCLC B and BCLC C
We further assessed LC at 1 year and 1-year-mortality in
patients in BCLC stage B and C (Table 3). In the
matched cohort LC was comparable in BCLC B patients
treated with TACE compared to SBRT patients (83.7%
vs. 82.6%, p = 0.847). In patients with BCLC C LC was
higher in patients by trend higher in patients treated
with SBRT compared to TACE patients (87.0% vs. 81.0%),
but without reaching statistical significance (p = 0.648).
1-year mortality was similar in patients with BCLC B,
however in BCLC C patients there was a trend to a higher
1-year mortality in patients treated with TACE (81.0% vs.
54.5%, p = 0.397, Table 3).
Discussion
SBRT is currently not included in the HCC treatment
algorithm of the current European guidelines [1, 3, 16].
However, there is growing evidence that SBRT can
achieve good local tumor control in patients with HCC,
even in patients with advanced liver disease with acceptable toxicity [6, 17]. Furthermore, SBRT as a bridging treatment to liver transplantation showed promising results
and can be used as an alternative to conventional bridging
treatments [2, 3, 8, 11]. Wahl et al. showed that SBRT was
equally effective compared to radiofrequency ablation [18].
Since many patients are diagnosed with intermediate or
even advanced stages HCC, it is therefore important to
evaluate the role of SBRT in this clinical setting. In patients
with intermediate HCC, TACE is the treatment of choice
[19]. Importantly, many patients are treated with several

TACE sessions to achieve a good local tumor control and
in some patients further transarterial approaches may be
limited due to impaired vascular architecture after several
embolization procedures. In these patients sorafenib is
standardly used by applying the concept of treatment stage
migration. However, sorafenib is associated with several
adverse events such as diarrhea and hand-foot syndrome
which may limit treatment duration and therefore efficacy
[20]. With regard to these adverse events which significantly reduce quality of life, SBRT may be a well-tolerated
treatment [21–23]. Importantly, as shown in our
unmatched cohort, patients treated with SBRT often
present with advanced tumor stages. Therefore, SBRT
patients had larger tumors and more often portal vein
thrombosis (Table 1). In summary, there are significant
differences in baseline characteristics in patients who
are allocated to TACE or SBRT for HCC treatment.
Being aware of these differences, we performed propensity
score matching in order to adjust for these parameters
which may be important for the analyzed outcome. However, as 98.6% of the patients treated with TACE had no
prior HCC treatment and 83.0% of the SBRT patients had
been previously been treated for HCC, we were not able
to adjust for this variable as the differences were too large
and sample size of the SBRT patient was too small.
After propensity score matching, we analyzed LC at 1 year
after TACE or SBRT. The LC of 84.8% in SBRT patients
was comparable to the LC of 82.9% in TACE patients
(p = 0.805). Moreover, our LC at 1 year after SBRT was
comparable to those reported in previous studies [6].
Further, we set out to determine the OS in our patients
treated with TACE or SBRT. In the unmatched cohort,
patients with TACE had significantly better OS compared to patients treated with SBRT (17.0 [14.4–19.6]

months vs. 9.0 [6.7–11.3] months, p = 0.016) which may
be explained by the significantly different baseline characteristics as they are well-known strong prognostic
factors. However, after adjusting for these confounders,
OS in patients with SBRT was similar to those of patients
treated with TACE (11.0 [5.9–16.1] months in TACE
patients vs. 9.0 [6.7–11.3] months in SBRT patients, p =
0.492). In accordance with the OS, the 1-year mortality rate
in patients treated with SBRT was comparable to TACE
patients (52.9% vs. 53.1%, p = 0.989). Our sub-group
analyses in the matched cohort showed a trend to a
higher 1-year-mortality in BCLC C patients treated with
TACE compared to SBRT while LC was by trend higher
in SBRT treated patients. Although not being statistically
significant, these results may be the rationale for preferring TACE in BCLC B patients if technical feasible while
BCLC C patients may be allocated to SBRT treatment.
However, this suggestion has to be verified in prospective
trials, especially taking into account prior HCC treatment,
failure to previous TACE and technical feasibility of
recurrent TACE.
Moreover, we evaluated adverse events after TACE and
SBRT treatment. In patients treated with TACE, symptoms
of postembolization syndrome occurred which resolved
during symptomatic treatment. In patients treated with
SBRT, although having received prior HCC treatment, toxicities were also moderate in concordance to published literature [6, 24]. Furthermore, radiotherapy is a very well
tolerated treatment in terms of quality of life with the
only observed deficits being temporary worsening of
appetite and fatigue [23]. Combining the good local tumor
control and the few adverse events, SBRT may emerge as
an effective and safe treatment in patients with
intermediate HCC and also in selected patients with advanced HCC.
We have to acknowledge several limitations of our
study. Our study was a retrospective, single-center observational study with a limited sample size, especially of the
SBRT patients. The decision for TACE or SBRT depended
on several different factors such as intrahepatic tumor
expansion, extent of PVT, liver function, the performance
status of the patients and previous HCC therapies. We
tried to reduce this bias by propensity score matching.
However, matching was not perfect as we were not able to
adjust for previous HCC therapies which would have
resulted in a very small sample size without the possibility
to perform statistical analyses. Therefore, prior HCC
therapy may have affected outcome in patients with SBRT,
especially as many of our SBRT patients had previous
TACE treatment. However, according to the BCLC classification (TACE) is recommended as first-line treatment in
patients with intermediate HCC. Only if TACE is technically
not feasible or if contraindications do not allow to perform
TACE, these patients may be allocated to SBRT treatment
after multidisciplinary discussion. In summary, in everyday
clinical practice, SBRT is currently not used as first-line

treatment in these patients and therefore, these patients
have received more prior HCC treatment compared to
TACE patients so that this scenario represents everyday
clinical practice. By considering this drawback, our results
may indicate that patients who are treated with SBRT after
prior HCC treatment including TACE have similar LC compared to patients who are only treated with TACE.
Conclusion
Nevertheless, our results may be the rational for designing
prospective, randomized-controlled trials to analyze the
efficacy of SBRT compared to TACE. With these preliminary results in mind, we have already started a prospective, single-center study comparing TACE and SBRT
in this clinical setting (HERAKLES, DRKS number:
DRKS00008566) in order to determine the role of SBRT
in the treatment algorithm of HCC.
