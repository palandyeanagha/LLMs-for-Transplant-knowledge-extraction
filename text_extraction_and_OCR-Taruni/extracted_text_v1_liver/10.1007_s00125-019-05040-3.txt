Abstract
Gender and biological sex impact the pathogenesis of numerous diseases, including metabolic disorders such as diabetes. In most
parts of the world, diabetes is more prevalent in men than in women, especially in middle-aged populations. In line with this,
considering almost all animal models, males are more likely to develop obesity, insulin resistance and hyperglycaemia than
females in response to nutritional challenges. As summarised in this review, it is now obvious that many aspects of energy
balance and glucose metabolism are regulated differently in males and females and influence their predisposition to type 2
diabetes. During their reproductive life, women exhibit specificities in energy partitioning as compared with men, with carbohydrate and lipid utilisation as fuel sources that favour energy storage in subcutaneous adipose tissues and preserve them from
visceral and ectopic fat accumulation. Insulin sensitivity is higher in women, who are also characterised by higher capacities for
insulin secretion and incretin responses than men; although, these sex advantages all disappear when glucose tolerance deteriorates towards diabetes. Clinical and experimental observations evidence the protective actions of endogenous oestrogens,
mainly through oestrogen receptor α activation in various tissues, including the brain, the liver, skeletal muscle, adipose tissue
and pancreatic beta cells. However, beside sex steroids, underlying mechanisms need to be further investigated, especially the
role of sex chromosomes, fetal/neonatal programming and epigenetic modifications. On the path to precision medicine, further
deciphering sex-specific traits in energy balance and glucose homeostasis is indeed a priority topic to optimise individual
approaches in type 2 diabetes prevention and treatment.

Introduction
In the last few years, addressing gender and sex differences
has emerged as a priority topic in several medical areas,
including metabolic diseases [1]. While gender mainly refers
to the socially constructed identities of individuals, sex dimorphism relies on the fundamental biological disparities that
differently influence physiological or pathophysiological
processes in males and females. Although not fully understood, underlying mechanisms largely involve sex steroid
hormones and sex chromosomes but also include sex specificities in fetal/neonatal programming and epigenetic modifications. Recent guidelines, thus, emphasise the need to
consider such sex differences during preclinical (cellular and

animal models) to clinical research efforts, avoiding the traditional male predominance when using these approaches [2].
It is now obvious that sex has a significant impact on the
pathogenesis of metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes.
The first dimorphic aspect concerns diabetes prevalence, with
a male predominance reported in humans and also in most
animal models, with females being generally protected from
diet-induced metabolic disorders [3]. Therefore, the present
review aims to discuss how sex differences in energy balance
and metabolic homeostasis influence susceptibility to diabetes, with a specific focus on the protective actions of endogenous oestrogens.
Diabetes is more prevalent in men:
epidemiological evidence
Except in some parts of the world, such as the Middle East
and North Africa, diabetes is more prevalent in men than in
women, especially in middle-aged populations. Analysing
751 population-based studies (4.4 million adults from 146
countries), the NCD Risk Factor Collaboration first
showed that age-standardised prevalence rates more markedly increased in men (4% to 9%) than in women (5% to
8%) between 1980 and 2014, despite some substantial
disparities across geographical areas [4]. Similarly, the
US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
recently reported a higher prevalence of diabetes among
men compared with women (13% vs 11% for the 2013–
2016 period, in adults aged 20–79 years) [5]. The last
global estimates published by the International Diabetes
Federation also indicate sex differences in worldwide
diabetes prevalence in adult populations (9.1% in men vs
8.4% in women), suggesting that about 12.3 million more men
than women worldwide were living with diabetes in 2017.
The peak in diabetes prevalence occurs earlier in men (65–
69 years of age) than in women (70–79 years of age) and male
predominance is, therefore, specifically observed in middleaged populations (35–69 years of age) [6].
Studies offering systematic screening procedures in large
populations confirmed a male predominance when diagnosis
of diabetes was based on fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and/or
HbA1c measurements, but not when considering 2 h plasma
glucose after an OGTT (2hPG-OGTT). Among the 7680 men
and 9251 women included in the European Diabetes
Epidemiology: Collaborative analysis Of Diagnostic criteria
in Europe (DECODE) study, undiagnosed diabetes and
impaired fasting glucose, both defined by isolated FPG, were
more prevalent in men in the 30–69 years age range. However,
the prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance, was higher in
women in all age groups [7]. In 13,016 inhabitants (aged 30–
60 years) of the Copenhagen county (Denmark) who participated in the Inter99 study, diagnosis of dysglycaemia was
reported in 49.6% (95% CI 43.4%, 55.6%) of men and
34.6% (95% CI 28.6%, 41.0%) of women by the age of
60 years. The risk of diabetes (OR 1.7 [95% CI 1.3, 2.1])
and impaired fasting glucose (OR 3.0 [95% CI 2.4, 3.7]),
but not of impaired glucose tolerance (OR 1.0 [95% CI 0.9,
1.2]), appeared to be higher in men than in women [8]. In
individuals with normal glucose tolerance, women generally
exhibit lower FPG and HbA1c levels but increased 2hPGOGTT levels, as compared with men [9, 10]. However, these
differences could be the consequence of challenging all individuals with the same amount of glucose, regardless of sexdependent characteristics, such as body size, muscle mass or
physical fitness [9], but they could also be owing to delayed
gut glucose absorption in women as compared with men [11].
These later observations perfectly illustrate the need for
considering both sexes, as well as their phenotypic and biological specificities, in all studies devoted to metabolic
regulation.
A critical role for sex steroid hormones
in diabetes susceptibility
Both clinical and experimental studies indicate that postpubertal sex steroid hormones largely contribute to sex
differences in diabetes susceptibility. The protective role
of endogenous oestrogens in women is evidenced by the
deleterious impact of the menopause on body composition
and glucose homeostasis, leading to an increased incidence
of metabolic disorders vs premenopausal women [12].
Early menopause and premature ovarian insufficiency are
associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes as
compared with premenopausal women, while a 21–35%
reduction in diabetes incidence has been reported in menopausal women receiving oestrogen-based hormonal therapy vs placebo [13–15]. Further demonstrating the contribution of the oestrogen pathway to diabetes susceptibility
in humans, rare loss-of-function mutations in the gene
encoding either aromatase (the enzyme that converts
androgens into oestrogens) or oestrogen receptor α
(ERα) result in dysmetabolic phenotypes in individuals
of both sexes [16]. Similarly, deletion of aromatase or
ERα in transgenic mice also leads to obesity, insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance [17, 18]. Moreover,
in all animal models, oestrogen-associated protection of
females from high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced obesity and
hyperglycaemia is totally abolished by bilateral ovariectomy, but restored by oestrogen administration [18, 19].
Androgens are also associated with metabolic risks, but
mainly in pathophysiological situations leading to unbalanced
androgen/oestrogen ratio. In men with hypogonadism, low
testosterone plasma concentrations are correlated with an
increased risk of type 2 diabetes and vascular diseases, while
454 Diabetologia (2020) 63:453–461

testosterone supplementation clearly improves glucose and
lipid homeostasis [20]. However, besides the direct activation
of androgen receptors, part of the metabolic actions of testosterone can also result from indirect mechanisms, through its
aromatisation into oestrogens. Conversely, androgen excess
can lead to significant metabolic alterations in women. High
testosterone plasma levels are thought to favour insulin resistance and diabetes in women with polycystic ovary syndrome
(PCOS), but the most direct demonstration comes from the
development of metabolic disorders in transsexual people on
high-dose androgens [3]. Furthermore, dihydrotestosterone
administration was recently reported to predispose female
mice to diabetes by promoting insulin resistance and beta cell
failure through androgen receptor activation in neurons and
beta cells, respectively [21]. Overall, it is now clear that androgens play a complex role in the pathogenesis of obesity and
type 2 diabetes in both males and females, as recently
reviewed [21, 22].
In summary, although the androgen/oestrogen ratio
undoubtedly has an impact on metabolic regulation, both
human and animal studies demonstrate that endogenous
oestrogens protect females from type 2 diabetes, at least
during their reproductive life. As detailed below,
oestrogens largely contribute to sexual dimorphisms in
energy balance and metabolic homeostasis, which are
the main determinants of sex differences in type 2 diabetes susceptibility. The main sexually dimorphic body
composition and metabolic traits in humans, and the
tissue-specific actions of oestrogens (as reported in
animal models) are summarised in Figs 1 and 2,
respectively.
Biological sex as a determinant of energy
balance and body composition
Sex influences energy partitioning The sexual dimorphism
regarding energy partitioning is classically viewed as an
evolutionary adaptation allowing females to better withstand
periods of undernutrition, with the ultimate aim of preserving
their reproductive functions. Energy storage is generally
favoured in females, whereas males predominantly mobilise
energy stores to enable sustained physical activity [3]. Sex
differences in adipose tissue distribution respond to these
physiological considerations, with a predominance of subcutaneous tissue in women, which is better adapted for large and
long-term storage. Further supporting functional differences
in adipose tissue, sex-specific gene expression signatures were
recently found in human abdominal and gluteal subcutaneous
depots [23].
Sex also influences the utilisation of carbohydrates
and lipids as fuel sources. At rest and during the postabsorptive state, women are more likely to incorporate
NEFAs into triacylglycerols, thus promoting fat storage,
whereas men are more prone to produce energy through
plasma NEFA oxidation. Metabolic adaptation during
exercise also differs between the sexes since women
preferentially oxidise lipids while men use carbohydrates as the predominant fuel source [3].
Known to play a critical role in the regulation of energy
storage and metabolic fluxes, in a functional perspective, the
liver is undoubtedly one of the most sexually dimorphic
organs [24]. Indeed, in order to regulate fertility in relation
to nutrient availability, activation of ERα in hepatocytes

adapts hepatic metabolism in female mice to control lipid
synthesis, lipoprotein production and IGF-1 expression [24].
Moreover, while male mice restrain lipogenic and
gluconeogenic pathways to preserve amino acid reserves in
conditions of short-term fasting, female mice maintain hepatic
lipid synthesis using amino acids as a fuel source, clearly
illustrating sex differences in liver-associated metabolic adaptations [25].
Sex specificities in energy expenditure Contrasting with
observations in rodent models, clear differences have not been
demonstrated in energy expenditure between women and men
when adjusted for lean mass [26]. The relative contribution of
fat mass to resting metabolic rate is higher in women than in
men, even after adjustment for plasma sex steroid concentrations, body fat distribution and insulin sensitivity [27]. This
female trait correlates with higher expression of genes
involved in mitochondrial function in subcutaneous adipose
tissues, including UCP1 [27]. Accordingly, upon the recent
study of sex differences in cardio-metabolic traits in a large
panel of inbred mouse strains, males were found to have
reduced mitochondrial function in adipose tissues, which
was associated with an increased susceptibility to obesity
and metabolic disorders. These sex differences correlated with
the expression of a cluster of genes involved in adipose tissue
‘beiging’ and mitochondrial functions in adipose tissues [28].
In line with this observation, oestrogens have recently been
demonstrated to enhance thermogenesis in brown adipose
tissue and to promote beiging of white adipocytes. Indeed,
in vitro and in vivo approaches have demonstrated that selective activation of ERα induces adipose tissue beiging through
induction of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and
adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL)-mediated lipolysis,
resulting in NEFA generation and uncoupling protein 1
(UCP-1) activation [29]. Finally, as revealed by 18F-fluoro2-deoxy-d-glucose ( 1 8F-FDG) positron-emission
tomography–computed tomography (PET–CT) scanning,
brown adipose tissue is better preserved and more metabolically active in women than in men, thus contributing to
enhanced energy expenditure in the former [30, 31].
Besides their influence on adipose tissues, oestrogens
contribute to sexual dimorphism in energy balance through
direct effects on the central nervous system (CNS). In rodent
models, ERα activation in hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin
(POMC) and steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) neurons controls
food intake and energy expenditure, respectively [32]. More
specifically, ERα signalling induces AMPK inhibition in the
ventromedial nucleus, leading to enhanced thermogenesis in
brown adipose tissue through the sympathetic nervous system
[33]. Oestrogens also enhance leptin sensitivity within the
brain, reinforcing their impact on food intake [34]. In addition,
as compared with males, female mice are less prone to HFD-

induced hypothalamic inflammation and lipotoxicity; in the
CNS they have lower concentrations of saturated fatty acids
and sphingolipids but higher amounts of polyunsaturated fatty
acids [35].
In contrast, oestrogen-induced peripheral signals are also
able to regulate energy expenditure. For instance, ERα activation in hepatocytes indirectly promotes energy expenditure
in female mice by enhancing fibroblast growth factor 21
(FGF21) synthesis, thus conferring protection against adipose
tissue accumulation [36].
Consequences on body composition and ectopic fat As
compared with age-matched men, healthy premenopausal
women exhibit higher global fat mass and reduced fat-free
mass due to lower skeletal muscle mass. As previously
mentioned, women are characterised by an increased propensity to store adipose tissue in subcutaneous sites, especially in
gluteofemoral locations, as compared with preferential deposition in visceral area in men. This leads to significant sex
differences in body composition [3, 26]. Of note, women are
also less susceptible to ectopic fat deposition in most tissues,
such as the liver or the myocardium. Women are, thus,
protected from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)
before menopause, with the protective role of oestrogens
having been evidenced experimentally [37]. Consistent with
this, lower dietary fatty acid oxidation and a sustained increase
in de novo lipogenesis in the liver have been reported in
healthy men, as compared with women [38]. Conversely,
women have a higher propensity to accumulate
intramyocellular lipids in leg skeletal muscles, but without
deleterious consequences on insulin sensitivity [39]. This
probably explains why, despite a female predominance in
the worldwide prevalence of obesity, diabetes is more prevalent in men [3]. Interestingly, at least in middle-aged populations of European origin, women have a higher BMI than men
at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes [40].
Although ageing induces body composition changes in
both sexes, menopause triggers the progressive accumulation
of visceral fat that contributes to the increased risk of metabolic disorders [12]. Sex steroids influence body composition
in both sexes and post-menopausal changes, thus, illustrates
the beneficial role of oestrogens in women. Recent data from
mouse models also reveal that oestrogen signalling in adipocytes protects mice from adipose tissue inflammation and
fibrosis and, thus, contributes to the prevention of obesity
[41]. However, sex steroids are not the only contributors to
the sexual dimorphism in body composition. Indeed, new
mouse models that allow us to dissociate the specific contribution of sex chromosomes from the influence of gonadal
hormones have recently provided evidence that the number
of X chromosomes is positively associated with weight gain
and adiposity, whereas the Y chromosome exerts deleterious
effects on glucose metabolism [42].
Finally, it is obvious that such sex-specific biological traits
interfere with environmental determinants to modulate individual susceptibility to obesity and type 2 diabetes in humans.
For instance, gender-specific patterns in dietary behaviour,
mainly influenced by cultural and social factors, are likely to
have an impact on the incidence of metabolic disorders in both
sexes [43].
Sex-dimorphic traits in the regulation
of glucose homeostasis
Females are more insulin sensitive than malesIn a large population of individuals with normal blood glucose levels, insulin
sensitivity was assessed with the oral glucose insulin sensitivity index and found to be higher in women than in men, even
after adjustment for age and BMI [10]. However, this sex
advantage disappears when glucose tolerance deteriorates
towards type 2 diabetes, with a similar extent of insulin resistance observed in both sexes [44]. Hyperinsulinaemic
−euglycaemic clamp studies confirm that healthy women are
more sensitive to insulin than men when matched for physical
fitness (41% increase in whole body insulin sensitivity). This
is due to enhanced glucose uptake by skeletal muscle in
women [45, 46]. In agreement with this, sex differences have
been reported in muscle characteristics, with a higher proportion of type I fibres and capillary density in women, which
both favour enhanced insulin action [46].
The observation that women are less prone to insulin resistance than men is rather unexpected considering their
increased fat mass, circulating NEFA levels and lipid content
in myocytes, as well as a lower skeletal muscle mass. As a
plausible explanation, experimental data indicate that women
are protected from NEFA-induced insulin resistance and, thus,
more resistant to lipotoxicity, especially in skeletal muscles
[47]. Oestrogens confer protection against insulin resistance
through activation of the ERα pathway in insulin-sensitive
tissues, as demonstrated in mouse models [18, 19]. For example, in mice with specific myocyte ERα deletion, muscleassociated oxidative metabolism was altered and
hyperglycaemia developed, indicating that oestrogens
preserve mitochondrial function and insulin sensitivity [48].
The liver is also involved in this phenomenon, since ERα
signalling in hepatocytes mediates protective effects against
steatosis and insulin resistance in HFD-fed female mice [49].
Sex also has an impact on pancreatic endocrine function In
normoglycaemic individuals, estimations of beta cell function
following an OGTT or a standardised meal suggest that
women exhibit a greater insulin secretion capacity than men
[10]. Insulin secretion is more markedly increased in obese
men, as a way to compensate for a higher level of insulin
resistance. However, type 2 diabetes is characterised by
Diabetologia (2020) 63:453–461 457

similar impairments in beta cell function in both sexes [44].
Besides functional differences, analysis of pancreatic biopsies
from human donors recently estimated that islets from women
contain 6% more beta cells than those from men [50].
Using human islets or rodent models, experimental studies
demonstrate that sex hormones act as key regulators of islet
biology in a sex-specific manner. More specifically, endogenous oestrogens stimulate insulin synthesis and secretion and
exert protective effects on islets from females, preserving beta
cell function and preventing apoptosis induced by metabolic
injuries, such as oxidative stress and lipotoxicity [51].
Interestingly, the beneficial actions of oestrogens on beta cells
could explain why the male predominance in diabetes prevalence is not restricted to type 2 diabetes but also applies to
insulin-deficient forms of diabetes, such as type 1 diabetes,
that are diagnosed post puberty [52]. Indeed, type 1 diabetes
incidence is characterised by a sex ratio close to 1 in children,
but a significant male excess (sex ratio ~1.7) is reported in the
15–40 year age range, mainly in populations of European
origin [53].
Finally, it has been proposed that enhanced insulin secretion in women could also reflect sex differences in glucosedependent glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion.
Normoglycaemic women were, indeed, characterised by a
20% increase in serum GLP-1 concentrations following an
OGTT as compared with men, even after adjustment for
BMI. This sex difference was no longer observed in individuals with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes, irrespective of age or
weight [54]. Further supporting the enhancing effect of
oestrogens on incretin response, oestradiol was demonstrated
to positively regulate proglucagon-derived peptide secretion
in mouse and human alpha and L cells [55].
Future directions: how far are we
from a sex-specific medicine in diabetes?
Alongside the critical roles of oestrogens (as described in this
review), the complex mechanisms responsible for sexdimorphic metabolic regulation need to be further
characterised. It is suggested that analysis of sex steroid
balance in males and females cannot be restricted to circulating hormones levels but should also integrate their molecular
regulation at the tissue level. For example, aromatisation
should be further considered, especially in well-recognised
sites of oestrogen biosynthesis, such as the brain or adipose
tissues. In addition, it is also important to consider the regulation of local steroid activity resulting from sulfonation and
desulfation processes, which lead to hormonally deactivated
or activated molecules, respectively. In mouse models, both
steroid sulfatase and oestrogen sulfotransferase (EST) have
been demonstrated to interfere with the pathogenesis of type
2 diabetes in a sex-specific manner [56]. For instance,
inactivation of EST, the enzyme responsible for oestrogen
deactivation, increases energy expenditure, improves insulin
sensitivity, and reduces hepatic gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis in different mouse models of obesity-related metabolic
disorders, but only in females [57]. Although not easy to
address (and largely underestimated until now), such fine
regulation of the paracrine and intracrine actions of sex
steroids could be crucial for local metabolic regulation in both
sexes.
Interesting new insights have been provided into the contribution of sex chromosomes to dimorphic gene expression in
metabolic tissues [58]. New fields are also currently being
explored, such as the role of the gut microbiome in sexbiased susceptibility to metabolic disorders [59]. Finally, in
addition to genetic differences, sex-specific epigenetic modifications in responses to various physiological or pathophysiological situations, including exposure to hyperglycaemia and
environmental factors, undoubtedly represent an additional
layer for integration into the determinants of sex differences
in metabolism [3, 60]. Therefore, the study of sexual dimorphism in metabolism should no longer be limited to the period
of reproductive life alone, but considered from the preconception period and during the entire life.
Deciphering sex-specific traits in energy balance and
glucose homeostasis is certainly of major interest to optimise
individual approaches to diabetes prevention and treatment.
Sex has already been reported to influence therapeutic
responses in type 2 diabetes. For instance, insulin-naive
women initiating a basal insulin regimen showed a smaller
improvement in HbA1c associated with an increased rate of
hypoglycaemia vs men [61]. This may be related to the fact
that women exhibit reduced counter-regulatory hormonal
response (glucagon and adrenaline [epinephrine]), together
with lower rates of endogenous glucose production compared
with men [62]. More widely, to definitely consider sex as a
pillar of precision medicine, sex dimorphisms in metabolic
pathways still need to be better characterised in humans,
considering the effect of age, ethnic origin and pathophysiological status, such as the different phenotypical clusters of
diabetes.
Finally, studying sex differences in metabolism could also
lead to the development of new therapeutic approaches
targeting sex-dimorphic metabolic pathways or sex hormone
receptors. Countering the deleterious metabolic effects of
menopause in women at risk of type 2 diabetes is obviously
a priority objective in terms of public health. Beyond lifestyle
adaptations, hormone replacement therapy has been associated with reduced type 2 diabetes incidence in clinical trials, as
previously mentioned [14, 15], but the uncertainties regarding
its benefit–risk balance do not allow for its extended use in
this context. Menopausal women could, thus, particularly
benefit from new selective oestrogen receptor modulators that
are able to mediate the protective actions of oestrogens on
458 Diabetologia (2020) 63:453–461

body composition and glucose metabolism with limited side
effects on reproductive tissues [63]. Tissue-specific targeting
could also be a relevant strategy, as illustrated by the protection conferred by a GLP-1–oestrogen conjugate against dietinduced obesity and glucose intolerance in mice via selective
ERα activation in the CNS and the pancreas [64].
Conclusion
It is now clear that many aspects of energy and glucose
homeostasis are regulated differently in males and females,
influencing their predisposition to diabetes and associated
metabolic disorders. Moreover, sex biases have also been
described in the occurrence and the progression of diabetic
complications, reinforcing the need for sex-specific
approaches in diabetes management [65]. As in almost all
diseases, personalised management of diabetes should take
into account the sex of the patient.
