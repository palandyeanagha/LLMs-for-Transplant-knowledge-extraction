ABSTRACT
Professor Eberhard F. Mammen greatly contributed to the understanding of the
relationship between hemostatic abnormalities and liver diseases. The physiology of the
hemostatic system is closely linked to liver function because the liver parenchymal cells
produce most of the factors of the clotting and fibrinolytic systems. Acute or chronic
hepatocellular diseases and hepatic failure including liver cirrhosis, vitamin K deficiency,
liver surgery including liver transplantation, and sclerotherapy of bleeding esophageal
varices, which were classified by Prof. Mammen, show various hemostatic abnormalities in
the coagulation system, fibrinolytic system, platelets, and the reticuloendothelial system.
Hemostatic abnormalities in patients with hepatic failure or in those that have undergone
liver surgery are similar to those in disseminated intravascular coagulation. Prof. Mammen
also contributed to the study of vitamin K–dependent clotting factors, antithrombin, and
hemostatic molecular markers. Partly based on this work, the prothrombin time–international normalized ratio, several hemostatic molecular markers, and antithrombin therapy
have been recently developed for the diagnosis and treatment of thrombosis.

The physiology of the hemostatic system is
closely linked to liver function because the liver parenchymal cells produce most of the factors of clotting and
of the fibrinolytic systems and because the liver regulates
the activation or inhibition of both systems.1 Professor
Eberhard F. Mammen greatly contributed to the understanding of the relationship between hemostatic abnormalities and liver diseases.1–4 A disturbed liver
parenchymal cell function adversely impacts the hemostasis system, the extent of which correlates with the
degree of disease. These changes may be modest in
patients with mild liver disease but are severe in patients
with grossly compromised liver function. A wide spectrum of hemostatic defects is found in patients with liver
cirrhosis. Thrombocytopenia and thrombocytopathy
usually complicate the clinical presentation in patients
with liver cirrhosis, and systemic activation of the fibrinolytic system is always seen in cirrhotic individuals. The
reticuloendothelial system (RES) of the liver greatly
participates in the clearance of breakdown products of
activated clotting factors such as fibrin-related products,
thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT), plasmin–plasmin-inhibitor complex (PPIC), and activated platelets.
Prof. Mammen was an early pioneer in the investigation
of various hemostatic abnormalities associated with many
liver diseases including liver cirrhosis, and several liver
abnormalities due to liver transplantation5 or bone marrow transplantation6 have been recently noted.

HEMOSTATIC FACTORS PRODUCED
BY THE LIVER
With few exceptions, such as von Willebrand factor
(VWF), tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), thrombomodulin (TM), and urokinase-type plasminogen activator
(uPA), all other coagulation proteins and inhibitors are
either solely or partially synthesized by liver parenchymal
cells1–3 (Table 1).
Vitamin K–Dependent Factors
Four procoagulant factors of the clotting system (factors
II, VII, IX, and X), two anticoagulant factors (protein C
and protein S), and protein Z require post-ribosomal
modification after synthesis for proper physiologic function. These so-called vitamin K–dependent factors possess a specific number of glutamic acid residues that
function as potential binding sites for calcium bridges
in the NH2-terminal region. The glutamic acid residues
are converted to g-carboxyglutamic acids, and this modification is facilitated by a carboxylase that requires the
fat-soluble vitamin K as a cofactor. Both vitamin K
epoxide reductase (VKOR) and g-glutamyl carboxylase
exist in the liver.7 A failure of carboxylation, as in any
form of vitamin K deficiency or during therapy with oral
anticoagulants, will yield proteins (proteins induced by
vitamin K absence; PIVIKA) that cannot be bound by
calcium bridges to structural phospholipid surfaces, a
prerequisite for activation complex formation such as
tenase complexes, prothrombinase complexes, and extrinsic pathway complex. PIVIKA-II is also a tumor
marker of hepatocellular carcinoma.8 The resulting impaired functioning of the clotting system is often reflected
by changes in the activated partial thromboplastin time
(APTT), prothrombin time (PT), thrombin time (TT),
hepaplastin test, and thrombo test. Hemostatic defects,
especially of factor VII (FVII), thus depend on the extent
of residual liver function. Therefore, liver function is now
evaluated using the PT9 and hepaplastin test.
Other Factors
Other clotting factor such as fibrinogen, FV, FVIII,
FXI, FXII, prekallikrein, and high-molecular-weight
kininogen, proteins in the fibrinolytic system such as
plasminogen and a2-antiplasmin inhibitor, plasmin inhibitor (PI) and anticoagulant protease inhibitors such as
antithrombin (AT),10 heparin cofactor II,11 protein C
(PC), protein S (PS), and tissue factor pathway inhibitor
(TFPI) are also synthesized by the liver.
Prof. Mammen reviewed AT in detail.12,13 AT is
a single-chain glycoprotein in plasma and belongs to the
family of the serpins. It is synthesized in liver parenchymal cells, and its plasma concentration is between
112 and 140 mg/L. AT is a unique inhibitor of the
clotting system and neutralizes most of the enzymes
generated during activation of the clotting cascade,
especially thrombin, FXa, and FIXa. Equimolar, irreversible complexes are formed between AT and the
enzymes including TAT. A TAT assay has been developed as a sensitive marker for thrombosis such as pre–
disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).14 The
interaction between AT and the activated clotting factors is at least 1000-fold increased in the presence of
heparin and its derivatives. Heparins bind to multiple
sites of the AT molecule, resulting in a steric reconfiguration. Heparins contain a specific pentasaccharide unit
that is the minimum requirement for AT binding. The
glycosaminoglycan (GAG) heparan sulfate found on
endothelial cell surfaces also contains this pentasaccharide and can thus ‘‘activate’’ AT. It is traditionally
acknowledged that much of the physiologic inactivation
of enzymes by AT occurs on the endothelium, mediated
by heparan sulfate. The binding of AT to the GAGs also
releases prostacyclin, which possesses strong antiinflammatory properties.15 In a clinical trial of highdose AT treatment for severe sepsis,16 AT significantly
reduced the mortality in patients treated without heparin
or in those with DIC.17 Decreased AT concentration in
plasma is rarely due to genetic abnormalities18 but is
usually acquired in patients with liver disorders or those
with DIC.12 In patients with DIC, especially due to
sepsis, increased consumption of AT is frequently observed. During acute and severe DIC, clotting factors
and inhibitors are consumed faster than they can be
reproduced. Therefore, the observation of reduced
plasma AT levels not only helps the diagnosis but also
predicts outcome in patients with septic DIC.19 The
important role of AT in DIC and sepsis is the basis for
considering AT concentrates as an additional therapeutic modality.12,16,17

In the fibrinolytic system, Prof. Mammen and his
co-workers reported two families and one single patient
with a heterozygous PI deficiency that is a rare congenital bleeding disorder.20 All patients and most relatives
with the defect had a mild bleeding tendency. Mammen
and colleagues suggested the incorporation of the PI
assay for all patients who have a bleeding disorder with
normal platelet studies and normal clotting profiles.
After the study of PI, the PPIC assay21 was developed
to measure plasmin generation. The assay of PI or PPIC
is useful to monitor anti-fibrinolytic therapy or fibrinolytic therapy such as that using tPA or uPA.
Hemostatic factors such as thrombopoietin22 and
a disintegrin-like and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motifs 13 (ADAMTS13)23 in platelets
were recently reported to be synthesized by the liver.
Thrombopoietin promotes thrombopoiesis, regulates the
number of platelets in bone marrow, and is reduced after
liver resection, and this thus causes thrombocytopenia.24
ADAMTS13 cleaves the ultralarge multimers of VWF
to prevent hyperaggregation of platelets, and the deficiency of ADAMTS1325 is known to cause thrombotic
thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is sometimes observed during liver
transplantation, and reduction of ADAMTS13 is
thought to be one of the important causes of TMA.26
HEMOSTATIC ABNORMALITIES DUE
TO VARIOUS LIVER DISEASES
Prof. Mammen identified many hemostatic abnormalities
associated with various liver diseases after several types of
liver disturbance1–3 (Table 2). Acute or chronic hepatocellular diseases, liver cirrhosis, vitamin K deficiency, liver
surgery including liver transplantation, and sclerotherapy
of bleeding esophageal varices are associated with various
hemostatic abnormalities, which involve the coagulation
system, fibrinolytic system, platelets, and RES. Patients
with hepatic failure including liver cirrhosis may present
with the entire or wide spectrum of factor deficiencies
and may even develop a peculiar form of DIC.27,28
Except for FVIII:C and VWF, all procoagulant and
inhibitory factors are reduced, as a result of impaired
protein synthesis. Abnormal fibrinogen29 and prothrombin molecules can be identified, and both the platelet
count and function are altered.
Prof. Mammen and co-workers developed a fully
automated procedure for the determination of fibrin(ogen) degradation products (FDPs) known as the I. L.
Multistat Centrifugal Analyzer (MCA; Instrumentation
Laboratories, Lexington, MA).30 The assay is based on
the turbidometric measurement of the interaction between antibodies and human fibrinogen and defibrinogenated specimens. This method makes the accurate
quantization of degradation products between 10 and
160 mg/mL possible with high reproducibility. The
method can be adapted to existing automated coagulation
procedures and can become part of coagulation panels.
Recently, many fibrin-related markers such as soluble
fibrin (SF) and D-dimer and fibrin and FDPs have been
automatically measured, representing a valuable parameter for the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/
pulmonary embolism (PE) or DIC.31,32 D-dimer tends
to be used to reduce the need for invasive and costly

imaging by exclusion of thrombosis when a D-dimer
value below the method-specific cutoff is observed in the
outpatient setting.32
Acute or Chronic Hepatocellular Disease
Patients with acute or chronic liver infection or with
toxic or drug-induced hepatitis may have an impaired
hemostatic system that can predispose the patient to
bleeding.1–3 The degree of disturbance is related to the
extent of liver parenchymal cell damage. Some patients
with mild hepatitis may display no abnormal findings.
Others may have slightly prolonged PT that can be
traced back to slightly below normal levels of FVII,
which with PC represents the most sensitive of all the
vitamin K–dependent factors. The plasma levels of other
vitamin K–dependent factors and non-vitamin-K–
dependent factors may also be decreased. These changes
are readily noticeable by prolonged PT and APTT, but
the TT and fibrinogen levels are usually within the
normal range. Abnormal fibrinogen and prothrombin
molecules can also be identified, though less frequently.
The levels of FVIII and VWF, which are acute inflammatory proteins, are usually elevated. All procoagulant
and inhibitory factors, except for FVIII:C and VWF, are
decreased, which is a reflection of impaired protein
synthesis. Mild thrombocytopenia can be encountered
in patients with hepatitis, but this appears to be clinically
insignificant in bleeding, and currently platelet count is
one of the most useful indicators for success of interferon
therapy for hepatitis.33
Liver Cirrhosis
Patients with cirrhosis have a broad spectrum of hemostatic abnormalities involving the clotting system, the
fibrinolytic system, and platelets.1–3 Because of the
impaired protein synthesis, most factors and inhibitors
of the clotting and the fibrinolytic systems are markedly
reduced. In addition, abnormal vitamin K–dependent
factors and fibrinogen molecules are frequently encountered. Most patients have hyperfibrinolysis and thrombocytopenia, and nearly all patients have some bleeding
tendency. Blood transfusion34 is sometimes required in
severe bleeding. These changes are reflected in a progressively prolonged PT and APTT. As the procoagulant factors decrease, the regulators of the clotting system
(AT, PC, and PS) also will decline. Fibrinogen levels are
usually decreased, especially in severe forms of cirrhosis,
and abnormal fibrinogen molecules29 can be detected.
Plasminogen and PI are also affected by liver parenchymal cell damage and are usually below the normal range.
In contrast, tPA, uPA, and PAI-1 levels usually remain
unchanged, and evidence of an activated fibrinolytic
system in many patients can be shown by shortened
euglobulin lysis times (ELT) and elevated D-dimer. The
mechanism of activated fibrinolysis is due to elevated
levels of activators, especially tPA, resulting from
the impaired clearance of activators and decreased
levels of inhibitors, including histidine-rich glycoprotein
(HRGP).35 Hemostatic molecular markers such as
TAT, PPIC, and D-dimer are frequently elevated in
patients with cirrhosis. Thrombocytopenia, due to pooling of platelets in an enlarged spleen, is a common
feature of liver cirrhosis. In addition, increased consumption, folic acid deficiency, and decreased thrombopoiesis may contribute to the low platelet counts.
Therefore, Prof. Mammen suggested that severe liver
cirrhosis has laboratory findings similar to those of DIC,
indicating that a differential diagnosis between DIC and
severe liver failure is still challenging.36
Vitamin K Deficiency
Hepatobiliary diseases such as obstruction and fistulas,
intravenous nutrition, and prolonged use of certain oral
antibiotics may lead to vitamin K deficiency.1–3 The
hemostatic defects related to vitamin K deficiency are
limited to the vitamin K–dependent procoagulants and
anticoagulants (FII, FVII, FIX, FX, and PC and PS); all
other parameters remain in the normal range. The drop
in the levels of PC parallels the decline in FVII. Therefore, measurement of both FVII and PC is useful for the
diagnosis of PC deficiency in patients treated with oral
anticoagulant therapy.37 The decrease in procoagulants
will initially result in a slightly prolonged PT and
ultimately in a markedly abnormal PT and APTT. All
other screening tests and clotting factor levels are normal. These factors indicate that the monitoring of oral
anticoagulant therapy by prothrombin time–international normalized ratio (PT-INR) is useful for anticoagulation therapy.38 An examination of VKOR and
cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) genes may be helpful in determining the initial amount of coumarins and
the individual response for adjusting the dosage accordingly.39,40
Liver Surgery
Liver transplantation has become an established procedure for patients with severe, life-threatening liver disease, especially in patients with end-stage hepatitis B
infection. In addition to orthotopic liver transplantation,
patients are subjected to partial liver resections and
peritoneovenous (LeVeen) shunts (Table 3). Surgery
associated with the liver leads to major hemostatic
alterations.1–3 The disturbances associated with liver
surgery depend on the underlying liver problem, surgical
procedure, and host reaction. Prof. Mammen and his coworkers studied AT, prekallikrein, and fibronectin levels
in 290 surgical patients.41 The AT (49%  17), prekallikrein (26%  12), and fibronectin (128 mg/mL  72)

levels in septic patients were significantly lower than
those in the patients without sepsis. The AT level in
patients who died (42%  22) was significantly lower
than that in patients who survived. They suggested that
AT, prekallikrein, and fibronectin levels in critically ill
surgical patients might allow earlier diagnosis and more
effective treatment of sepsis.
Bleeding associated with a partial liver resection is
mostly mechanically induced, but chronic DIC may also
be present. Orthotopic liver transplantation can be
associated with severe hemorrhage, which is partly due
to the preexisting hemostasis defects and partly to a form
of DIC with a marked fibrinolytic response. This is
especially noted during the anhepatic phase and when
the donor liver is perfused by the recipient’s blood.
Recently hemostatic abnormalities during liver transplantation have been classified into five periods42: preoperative period, preanhepatic stage, anhepatic phase,
reperfusion and post-reperfusion phase, and postoperative period. Postoperative recovery is quick, provided
the graft is not rejected. Postoperatively, there may be an
initial hypercoagulable state, which could be related to
the thrombosis occasionally encountered.43,44 TMA is
also reported to be one of the most important complications in liver transplantation.5,45
Perioperative defects in the hemostasis system can
be extensive and depend on the underlying disease. They
usually resemble those illustrated in Table 4. The first
major hemorrhages are encountered when the patient’s
liver has been removed and when the patient is in an
anhepatic phase. There is a significant activation of the
fibrinolytic system, apparently due to a major release of
tPA. This fibrinolytic ‘‘burst’’ is apparently due to a
massive release of tPA from the patient’s endothelial
cells and a reduction in phagocytosis capacity of the
RES. A second fibrinolytic burst arises as the donor liver
is perfused. Once again, extremely high tPA levels and
very low PAI-1 levels can be found. Some of the
laboratory findings in DIC may be a reflection of
decreased hepatic clearance of activation products by
the RES of the diseased liver. Severe bleeding due to
the activation of the fibrinolytic system is encountered in
orthotopic liver transplantation.46 Therefore, DIC has
been postulated in these patients, as elevated TAT and
D-dimer levels have been observed. It is unclear whether
this fibrinolytic response is primary or secondary. Antifibrinolytic drugs, if used cautiously, result in markedly
reduced bleeding, thus decreasing the need for blood and
blood-product substitution.2
The LeVeen shunt is invariably related to DIC;
hemorrhages seen in conjunction with peritoneovenous
shunt operation are usually caused by a DIC-like presentation with a profound activation of the fibrinolytic
system. This complication seems to be due to the influx
of ascites fluid containing tissue factor (TF), tPA, uPA,
and fibrin-related products, and so forth. TF,47 the
activator of the extrinsic pathway in the coagulation
system, is considered to be the cause of DIC.
Sclerotherapy of Bleeding Esophageal Varices
Prof. Mammen and co-workers reported hemostatic
activation during sclerotherapy of bleeding esophageal
varices.48 Sclerotherapy of bleeding esophageal varices
has now become a common procedure in liver cirrhosis,
but little had been known about the possible entry of
sclerosants into the systemic circulation since 1991. A

mixture of thrombin, sodium tetradecyl, and cefazolin
was injected to study the effect of those factors on several
hemostatic parameters. In 24 patients with liver cirrhosis
(Child’s classification C), almost all patients had elevated
D-dimer, tPA, and PAI-1 levels, but they had decreased
fibrinogen, AT, PI, and PC levels, whereas TAT levels
were within the normal range before the injection.
Immediately after the injection, the TAT, D-dimer,
and tPA levels rose significantly, whereas the PAI-1
and PC levels decreased, and the AT, PI, and fibrinogen
levels remained unchanged. These data indicate that
thrombin entered the systemic circulation (elevated
TAT) and that the hemostasis system was briefly systemically activated (elevated D-dimer). In spite of these
changes in the hemostasis system, there were no clinically detectable thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications.
CONCLUSION
Professor Eberhard F. Mammen greatly contributed to
the understanding of the relationship between hemostatic abnormalities and liver diseases, that is, that the
physiology of the hemostatic system is closely linked to
liver function, and consequently many clinical applications have been developed partly based on his contribution.
