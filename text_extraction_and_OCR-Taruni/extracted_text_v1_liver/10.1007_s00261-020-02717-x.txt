Abstract
Chronic liver disease afects 185 million population worldwide. It encompasses a heterogenous disease spectrum, but all 
can lead to the development of liver fbrosis. The degree of liver fbrosis is not only a prognosticator, but has also been used 
to guide the treatment strategy and to evaluate treatment response. Traditionally, staging of liver fbrosis is determined on 
histological analysis using samples obtained from an invasive liver biopsy. Ultrasound-based liver elastography is a noninvasive method of assessing difuse liver disease in patients with known chronic liver disease. The use of liver elastography 
has led to a signifcant reduction in the number of liver biopsies performed to assess the severity of liver fbrosis and a liver 
biopsy is now reserved for only select sub-groups of patients. The aim of this review article is to discuss the key fndings 
and current evidence for ultrasound-based elastography in difuse liver disease as well as the technical challenges and to 
evaluate the potential research direction.

Introduction
Chronic liver disease afects 185 million people worldwide [1]. It encompasses many disease aetiologies with the 
vast majority of cases secondary to viral hepatitis, alcohol 
induced, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), autoimmune hepatitis 
(AIH). The common pathological consequence for all these 
diferent aetiologies involves the development of liver fbrosis; a result of chronic infammation. Untreated, liver fbrosis can lead to end stage liver disease and cirrhosis both of 
which are associated with a high morbidity and mortality. 
Assessment of the degree of liver fbrosis is clinically relevant in guiding treatment, evaluating response and predicting associated complications. Ultrasound-based elastography is an adjunctive tool to traditional B-mode ultrasound 
for assessing patients with chronic liver disease. It is inexpensive, quick to perform and has a short period of training 
for the operator.
Liver elastography guidelines are available from European Federation of Societies for Ultrasound in Medicine and 
Biology (EFSUMB) [2], World Federation for Ultrasound 
in Medicine and Biology (WFUMB) [3, 4] and Society of 
Radiologists in Ultrasound Consensus [5]. The aim of this 
review article is to discuss the key fndings and current 
evidence for ultrasound-based elastography in difuse liver 
disease as well as technical challenges and potential further 
research.
Types of elastography
Elastography is a method of studying tissue stifness. The 
diferences in tissue stifness between healthy and pathological tissue allows for the inference of the presence and 
severity of disease. There are two types of ultrasound-based 
elastography techniques; strain elastography (SE) and shear 
wave elastography (SWE).
Strain elastography
In SE the elasticity of the tissue of interest is assessed by 
comparing the degree of distortion with adjacent healthy 
tissue induced by an external manual compression or cardiac

pulsation [6, 7]. The output is a colour coded map of tissue 
elastogram super-imposed on the B-mode image (Fig. 1). 
This shows the relative degree of distortion between the 
tissue of interest and adjacent tissue. Therefore, the stain 
ratio between the pathological and healthy tissue is a relative 
measure of tissue elasticity.
Strain elastography was frst available commercially on 
the Hitachi platform also known as Real-time Tissue Elastography (RTE™, Hitachi Inc, Japan). Semi-quantitative 
analysis can be performed by calculating the liver fbrosis index (LFI) from 11 imaging features including mean 
relative strain value (MEAN), standard deviation of relative strain value (SD), percentage of lower strain area (% of 
blue colour area−% area), complexity of lower strain area, 
Skewness (SKEW), Kurtosis (KURT), Entropy (ENT), textural complexity, inverse diference moment (IDM), angular 
second moment, contrast (ASM), and correlation (COR) [8] 
(Fig. 1). The results from a RTE™ study is more operatordependent and requires additional training when compared 
to using the SWE techniques [9]. There have been far fewer 
publications using SE compared to SWE and these studies 
were predominantly performed in East Asian populations, 
where obesity is less prevalent. Meta-analysis showed the 
AUROC for signifcant fbrosis (F>2), advanced fbrosis 
(F>3) and cirrhosis (F=4) were 0.79, 0.94 and 0.85 using 
LFI [10]. Furthermore, few studies have compared diagnostic performance of RTE™ against SWE [9, 11]. The use 
of RTE™ in assessing stages of liver fbrosis has not been 
incorporated in EASL, EFSUMB [6], SRU [5] and WFUMB 
guidelines [3, 4].
Assessment of liver stifness using both SWE (2D-SWE) 
and SE can be simultaneously performed on ARIETTA

Hitachi 850 known as Combi-Elasto (Hitachi Medical Corporation). Assessing liver stifness using combined RTE™ 
and the shear wave technique could potentially identify the 
infuence of any confounding factors on liver stifness such 
as acute infammation, biliary obstruction or hepatic congestion. During follow-up studies changes in relative strain 
during RTE™ examination is thought to be rarely afected 
by these factors [9].
Shear wave elastography
In SWE, an acoustic impulse is generated by the transducer 
and transmitted from the transducer to the region of interest 
(ROI) where the propagation speed of the resultant shear 
wave is measured. Tissue elastic modulus is calculated 
through the equation, E=3ρc2, where E is tissue elasticity, 
C is shear wave velocity, and ρ is the density of the tissue 
in kg/m3
. Therefore, shear wave velocity is a quantitative 
method of determining the absolute tissue elasticity. Shear 
wave elastography encompasses several diferent methods 
of measuring shear wave velocities: transient elastography 
(TE), point shear wave elastography (pSWE) and twodimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE). There are 
many commercially available machine platforms allowing 
users to perform a liver elastography study are listed, but 
not exclusively, in Table 1.
TE is more commonly known by the brand name FibroScan™ (Echosens, Paris, France). TE displays shear wave 
velocity by converting this to kilopascals (kPa) but does not 
have the capability of forming a B-mode image of the liver 
during the elastography examination. This cannot be used 
in patients with abdominal ascites as measurements will be 
unreliable and has technical limitations with obese patients. 
This may be overcome by using a diferent transducer, the 
XL transducer, which is designed for obese patients.
pSWE and 2D-SWE are performed with conventional 
ultrasound machines which allows simultaneous B-mode 
imaging allowing for a comprehensive liver assessment. 
The diference between pSWE and 2D-SWE is that the former emits a single shear wave at a single frequency for each 
measurement, while the latter emits multiple shear waves 
simultaneously. Conventionally the measurements are 
expressed as a velocity, although many manufacturers are 
able to also display measurements in kPa. Conversion from 
velocity measurements to kPa results in additional inaccuracies but TE and FibroScan™ have established the kPa as 
a readily identifable measurement in hepatology practice.
Elastography examination techniques
Patients are required to fast for at least a minimum of 2 h 
and rest for 10 min prior to the examination to avoid falsely 
elevated liver stifness measurements [12]. The examinations are performed with patients lying in supine position 
with their right arm extended over their head to increase 
intercostal space. Measurement should be taken from the 
right lobe of the liver via intercostal costal approach. Using 
the FibroScan™ technique, there is no region of interest to

place as there is no visualization of the liver, and readings 
are obtained from the perceived correct area of liver. With 
ultrasound-based techniques, where the liver is visualized, 
operators should place the region of interest (ROI) box in 
the right lobe of the liver avoiding any rib shadows, large 
blood vessels and the biliary tree. There are a number of 
commercial systems which incorporate both pSWE and 
2D-SWE examinations within the machine functionality, as 
summarized in a recent review [13].
For pSWE examination, the ROI box should be placed 
1–2 cm below the liver capsule to avoid reverberation artefact and the subcapsular liver parenchyma which is stifer, 
a consequence of the proximity to the liver capsule tissue 
(Fig. 2). This is not strictly necessary for 2D-SWE, as a 
colour map of tissue elastogram will be displayed for the 
ROI box and subsequent separate analysis box can be placed 
within the ROI box, avoiding any reverberation artefact 
(Fig. 3). Additionally, for both pSWE and 2D-SWE, the 
transducer should be perpendicular to the liver capsule.
Using the median of 10 measurements as the stiffness value was recommended as standard practice when 
using the FibroScan™ machine and has subsequently 
been adopted as the required number of measurements in 
clinical practice by majority of pSWE studies, and has 
become the accepted requisite number of measurements 
supported by both the EFSUMB and WFUMB guidelines 
[4, 14]. However, recent evidence has suggested that fewer 
measurements may be acceptable when using pSWE [15]. 
For 2D-SWE, the availability of the colour stifness map 
prior to selecting the analysis box reduces the data variability allowing few measurements [16]. EFSUMB and 
WFSUMB both suggested that a minimum of three measurements be taken [4, 14] and recent meta-analysis from 34 
2D-SWE studies showed fewer unreliable measurements 
in those studies which obtained more than three measurements [17]. All guidelines recommend the use of interquartile range over median (IQR/M), an indicator for data 
variability, to assess data quality when performing liver 
stifness measurement using TE and pSWE techniques. 
Liver stifness values with IQR/M of ≤ 30% are associated with increased accuracy for staging liver fbrosis [15, 
18–20] as well as has a better agreement among diferent 
elastography machines [21]. Reducing the number of liver 
stifness measurements has also been shown to have little 
efect on diagnostic accuracy using measurements with 
IQR/M≤30% [15]. However, IQR/M can only be obtained

once the study has been completed and more advanced 
stages of fbrosis can also infuence the data variability, 
hence afecting the IQR/M. Newer systems have incorporated reliability indicators for each measurement displayed 
at the time of study, which allows the examiner assess the 
data reliability at the time of the examination [22–24].
Normal values of shear wave velocities and 
potential confounding factors
Current literature for liver stifness measurement in healthy 
volunteers is summarized by Dong et al. [25]. Among the 
larger studies, the mean/median liver stifness value using 
FibroScan™ ranges between 4.1 to 5.5 kPa with calculated 
highest upper 95% percentile of 8.7 kPa [26–32]. The mean 
or median shear wave velocity measurements using pSWE 
are available for most commercial systems VTQ™ [33–37], 
ElastPQ™ [38, 39], Samsung RS80A [40] and these measurements are between 1.03 to 1.19 m/s, with the calculated 
highest upper 95% percentile value of 1.69 m/s and mean/
median value of 4.95 kPa to 5.5 kPa with 95% percentile 
value of 8.04 kPa [41–45].
Liver elastography measures tissue stifness which can 
be increased in circumstances other than the presence of 
liver fbrosis. There are known confounding factors which 
include post prandial status [46], physical exercise [12], any 
liver disorders causing acute infammation associated with 
a transaminase rise [47], right heart failure causing liver 
congestion [48], the Valsalva manoeuvre during the examination and biliary obstruction [49]. Age, gender and body 
mass index are not thought to infuence the liver stifness 
value. The impact of hepatic steatosis on liver stifness is 
uncertain. Although steatosis has not been proven to afect 
liver stifness values, it will attenuate the shear wave.
Performance of shear wave elastography
Staging of fbrosis in chronic liver disease
SWE has been widely used to assess the degree of liver 
fbrosis in the management of patients with chronic liver 
disease in the last 5 years. In many centres, it has gradually 
replaced the “gold standard” of liver biopsy. In comparison 
to liver biopsy, liver elastography is non-invasive, has high 
patient compliance, good intra- and interobserver reproducibility [17, 50–55], whereas a liver biopsy is invasive with 
signifcant mortality and mobility [56, 57]. A liver biopsy 
is prone to sampling errors and the histological analysis has 
a high observer variability [58, 59].
The European Association for the Study of the Liver 
(EASL-ALEH) recommend TE as part of the non-invasive 
tests for evaluating severity and prognosis of liver disease 
by determining the stage of liver fbrosis [60]. In the United 
Kingdom, the National Health Service Institute for Health 
and Care Excellence (NICE) have also recommended the 
use of VTQ™ (pSWE, Siemens Healthineers, Germany) to 
assess liver fbrosis in patients with viral hepatitis B and 
C [61]. A number of meta-analyses have shown good to 
excellent diagnostic accuracy using TE in determining signifcant and severe liver fbrosis when the results were correlated with pathological classifcation of liver fbrosis with 
Area Under the Curve Receiver Operating Characteristic 
(AUROC) of 0.82–0.88 for signifcant fbrosis and 0.91–0.93 
for severe fbrosis [62–64]. Similar AUROC values for signifcant fbrosis and severe fbrosis using pSWE (VTQ™) 
(0.88—signifcant fbrosis; 0.91—severe fbrosis) [65] and 
2D-SWE AUROC (0.91—signifcant fbrosis; 0.95—severe 
fbrosis) [66] were reported. Both pSWE and 2D-SWE techniques have persistently demonstrated a higher technical 
success rate compared with TE [67, 68]. This is likely due 
to the ability to visualize the liver with the B-mode ultrasound component and place a region of interest within the 
liver, avoiding vascular/biliary structures, at the optimal 
depth during the pSWE and 2D-SWE examinations. Higher 
diagnostic accuracy has been reported for 2D-SWE compared to TE for all aetiologies of liver disease [69]. There 
are very few studies which have compared the diagnostic 
performance between 2D-SWE and pSWE; one early study 
showed a higher diagnostic performance using 2D-SWE in 
predicting signifcant fbrosis than with pSWE (VTQ™) [70] 
and later studies have showed similar performances [71, 72].
According to the EFSUMB guidelines, the optimal 
cut-of values for predicting signifcant fbrosis and cirrhosis in the presence of viral hepatitis C, for VTQ™ is 
1.21 m/s–1.34 m/s and 1.55 m/s and 2.00 m/s. In the presence of viral hepatitis B, a meta-analysis has indicated that 
the optimal cut-of for predicting signifcant fbrosis and cirrhosis is 1.35 m/s and 1.87 m/s respectively [73]. The optimal cut-of measurement for a mixed aetiology is reported in 
a meta-analysis to be 1.30±0.07 m/s for predicting signifcant fbrosis and 1.80±0.16 m/s for cirrhosis [74].
Measurement variation
More advanced stages of fbrosis will result in higher shear 
wave velocities, and this has been demonstrated in numerous studies. Whist these shear wave velocities difer signifcantly between the METAVIR classifcation categories 
of F1 and F4 liver fbrosis, the range of shear wave velocities can overlap signifcantly among the early and intermediate stages of fbrosis (F1 to F3). It has been also been 
observed that individual cut-of values for diferent fbrosis 
stages may also vary depending on disease aetiology and 
signifcantly, machine manufacturer, as absolute shear wave

velocities measurements are not transferable between different machines [21, 52, 75–77]. This is an issue associated 
with the technique of measurement and calculation with 
each manufacturer processing the data obtained diferently. 
This limitation may be overcome by using the same machine 
for all studies, but this may not be practicable. WFUMB 
has recommended applying a ‘rule of 5’ when interpreting 
liver stifness values and managing patients; measurement 
<5 kPa is normal, value between 5 and 10 kPa rules out 
compensated advanced chronic liver disease in the absence 
of known clinical signs, values between 10 and 15 kPa 
rules out advanced compensated chronic liver disease, values between 15 and 20 kPa highly suggests compensated 
advanced chronic liver disease and a value exceeding 20 kPa 
is in keeping with clinically signifcant portal hypertension 
[4]. This emphasizes the importance of interpreting liver 
stifness measurement by liver specialists in conjunction 
with patient’s other clinical data rather than being used as a 
screening tool in the general population [60].
Anti‑viral therapy
There are increasing numbers of hepatitis C patients with 
a sustained virological response when treated with the new 
generation of anti-viral therapy [78]. Although histology 
regression of fbrosis has been demonstrated [79], the role 
and timing of liver elastography in assessing regression of 
liver fbrosis is yet to be established. This is because the 
established cut-of values may not be applicable following 
eradication of viral hepatitis and it may be difcult to diferentiate the reduction of liver stifness as being due to reduction of infammation or regression of fbrosis. Abrupt reduction in liver stifness values assessed have been reported 
immediately after anti-viral treatment [80, 81].
Non‑alcoholic fatty liver disease
NAFLD is increasingly prevalent and is becoming the most 
common cause of chronic liver disease worldwide [82, 
83] with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) becoming 
the main indication for liver transplantation in the United 
States [84]. Liver fibrosis has been reported to be the 
strongest predictor for long term disease specifc mortality [85]. The EASL-ALEH clinical guidelines recommend 
non-invasive screening for liver fbrosis in NAFLD patients 
[60] with liver biopsy reserved for patients at high risk of 
advanced fbrosis if the non-invasive tests were unable to 
exclude advanced fbrosis [86]. Diagnostic performance of 
using TE, pSWE and 2D-SWE have all been reported in 
the literature. A recent meta-analysis reported cut-of values 
for severe fbrosis ranging from 7.6 to 9 kPa using TE with 
sensitivity between 83 and 89% and specifcity between 77 
and 78% [87]. Unreliable liver stifness values and increased 
technical failure rate in NAFLD patients appears to be associated with obesity and use of M transducer on the FibroScan™ machine, both of which increases the false positive 
rate, using the XL transducer can overcome these issues 
[88]. Fewer studies are available for pSWE and 2D-SWE 
[89–91]. A recent meta-analysis reported good and comparable diagnostic performance with AUROC between 0.86–0.95 
and 0.85–0.94 for TE and pSWE respectively [68]. A single 
meta-analysis has reported a superior diagnostic accuracy 
using 2D-SWE than TE [87].
Alcoholic liver disease
For patients with alcoholic liver disease, there is no consensus in terms of the optimum cut-of values for signifcant 
fbrosis, severe fbrosis and cirrhosis due to a wide range 
of cut-of values reported from TE studies [92–96]. There 
are a limited number of studies using pSWE and 2-SWE. 
Currently, WFUMB recommends the use of shear wave 
elastography (including TE, pSWE, 2D-SWE) in patients 
with alcoholic liver disease to rule out advanced disease 
[4], while EFSUMB only recommends the use of TE for this 
indication [14]. Signifcantly reduced liver stifness values 
have been reported in patients who have stopped consuming 
alcohol and falsely elevated values are seen in patients with 
acute alcohol intoxication with increased transaminases, 
bilirubin or gamma-glutamyl transferase. It is suggested 
that the best time to assess liver fbrosis is after a period of 
abstinence [97].
Assessment of portal hypertension
Patients with significant and severe portal hypertension are at increased risk of developing varices and consequently acute variceal bleeding. The gold standard of 
assessing the presence and severity portal hypertension is 
through an invasive angiographic technique; venous pressure gradient (HVPG) measurement with a cut-of value 
of HVPG≥10 mmHg indicating clinical signifcant portal 
hypertension and a HVPG≥12 mmHg indicating the potential for variceal bleeding [98, 99]. SWE has also been used 
as a non-invasive tool for assessing the severity of portal 
hypertension in patients with chronic liver disease. A metaanalysis has shown consistent evidence supporting the use of 
a liver stifness value as a biomarker for clinically signifcant 
portal hypertension, although the optimal cut-of value calculated from diferent studies varies from 15 to 25 kPa [100]. 
A further meta-analysis showed 2D-SWE values of 14 kPa 
or less can rule out clinically signifcant portal hypertension 
in cirrhotic patients with a reported AUROC value of 0.88 
and sensitivity value of 91%. However, this does not predict severe portal hypertension with the presence of varices 
needing treatment [101]. The current evidence suggests that 

Abdominal Radiology (2020) 45:3463–3472 3469
1 3
liver stifness values show a good correlation with HVPG 
up to 12 mmHg but cannot replace invasive assessment for 
assessing the severity and progression of the portal hypertension, primarily as the SWE values are less dependent on 
intrahepatic resistance with the development of fbrosis [60]. 
According to the Baveno VI consensus, patients with liver 
stifness of <20 kPa and platelet count of >150,000 can 
avoid screening endoscopy for esophageal varices [102].
Artifcial intelligence
The use of artificial intelligence (machine learning) in 
analysing medical images has experienced an exponential 
growth in recent years due to the arrival of deep learning 
methods using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) [103] 
and its superior accuracy compared to traditional supervisor classifcation methods [104]. Most recently, Wang et al. 
showed superior diagnostic performance in predicting 
severe liver fbrosis (F≥3) and cirrhosis (F4) in patients 
with chronic hepatitis B by analysing images from 2D-SWE 
studies using deep learning radiomics compared to 2D-shear 
wave velocity measurements [105]. Gatos et al. also demonstrated that by identifying areas of high and lower temporal 
stability from 2D-SWE images by means of deep learning 
algorithm, the diagnostic accuracy and inter observer variability are better when using areas of high temporal stability (reliable areas) than that from lower temporal stability 
(unreliable areas) [106].
Conclusion
Ultrasound-based elastography ofers a cost-efective, noninvasive and accurate method of assessing the severity of 
difuse liver disease. Currently, it has superior accuracy in 
predicting cirrhosis rather than signifcant fbrosis. Its high 
negative predictive value should be incorporated into the decision-making process in managing patients with chronic liver 
disease. Individual optimal cut-of values of fbrosis stages for 
diferent aetiologies are yet to be validated in large prospective studies.
