Abstract
A novel human coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified in
Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Since then, the virus has made its way across the globe to affect over 180
countries. SARS-CoV-2 has infected humans in all age groups, of all ethnicities, both males and females while
spreading through communities at an alarming rate. Given the nature of this virus, there is much still to be learned;
however, we know that the clinical manifestations range from a common cold to more severe diseases such as
bronchitis, pneumonia, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ failure, and even death. It is
believed that COVID-19, in those with underlying health conditions or comorbidities, has an increasingly rapid and
severe progression, often leading to death. This paper examined the comorbid conditions, the progression of the
disease, and mortality rates in patients of all ages, infected with the ongoing COVID-19 disease. An electronic
literature review search was performed, and applicable data was then collected from peer-reviewed articles published
from January to April 20, 2020. From what is known at the moment, patients with COVID-19 disease who have
comorbidities, such as hypertension or diabetes mellitus, are more likely to develop a more severe course and
progression of the disease. Furthermore, older patients, especially those 65 years old and above who have comorbidities and are infected, have an increased admission rate into the intensive care unit (ICU) and mortality from the
COVID-19 disease. Patients with comorbidities should take all necessary precautions to avoid getting infected with
SARS CoV-2, as they usually have the worst prognosis.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a global
pandemic that initially started in Wuhan, China, and spread
extremely quickly, making its way to over 180 countries. As
the novel coronavirus continues to evolve, there are still many
limitations to our knowledge of who exactly this virus would
impact critically. Older adults and people of any age who have
underlying medical conditions, such as hypertension and diabetes, have shown worse prognosis [1]. Diabetic patients have
increased morbidity and mortality rates and have been linked
to more hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions [1]. People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) or any respiratory illnesses are also at higher risk for
severe illness from COVID-19 [2]. The risk of contracting
COVID-19 in patients with COPD is found to be 4-fold higher
than patients without COPD [2].

A retrospective study of middle-aged and elderly patients with COVID-19 found that the elderly population is
more susceptible to this illness and is more likely to be
admitted to the ICU with a higher mortality rate [3]. The
age-related changes in the geriatric population may be due
to the changes in lung anatomy and muscle atrophy which
results in changes in physiologic function, reduction of
lung reserve, reduction of airway clearance, and reduction
of the defense barrier function [3].
The clinical outcomes and length of stay directly correlate with the underlying conditions and age of the COVID19 patient. Researchers in China studied 344 patients in the
ICU with COVID-19. Of the 344 subjects, 133 patients
died on the 28th day with a median survival of 25 days
[4]. Of these patients, there were many with different comorbidities with 141 patients having hypertension [4]. In
survivors, the median duration of hospitalization for a negative test result was 12 days [4]. Furthermore, another
study conducted in China studied 633 COVID-19 patients,
of whom 247 patients had at least one comorbidity and that
concluded that older individuals, greater than 60 years,
were more likely to exhibit a more severe form of
COVID-19 disease [5]. During the study, 25 patients with
a median age of 69.3 years died giving an effective mortality rate of 3.77% [5].
It has been concluded that the older the patients are,
the more likely they are to succumb to the COVID-19
disease. In the USA, the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) uses COVID-NET in 14 states
to monitor the demographics of COVID-19 patients
who are being hospitalized [6]. From March 1 through
30, 2020, there were a total of 180 patients on COVIDNET, of which 89.3% of the patients had an underlying
comorbidity [6]. Of the 180 patients, 94.4% aged
65 years and older had at least comorbidity [6]. The
most common comorbidities found were obesity, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus [6]. The purpose of this
paper is to review these comorbidities, given that most
patients with severe COVID-19 cases had comorbidity.
Furthermore, we would like to examine specific comorbidities in relation to the COVID-19 disease progression
and outcomes based on the literature report since the
outbreak.
Methodology
An electronic literature search was performed using
PubMed, Google Scholar, EBSCOhost, Mendeley, and
MedLine Plus. The search was limited to peer-reviewed
articles published from January to April 20, 2020. An article was selected if it included keywords such as coronavirus, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, clinical features,
comorbidity, diabetes, and hypertension. Articles were
then reviewed and included based on the applicability to
the topic.
Presence of Comorbidities and the Clinical
Characteristics and Outcomes of COVID-19
Clinical Characteristics
Confirmed and reported cases of COVID-19 have a wide
range of symptoms from mild complaints, such as fever and
cough, to more critical cases associated with difficulty in
breathing [7]. Some of the most common symptoms include
cough, fever, chills, shortness of breath (SOB), muscle aches,
sore throat, unexplained loss of taste or smell, diarrhea, and
headache [8]. Symptoms can start as mild and become more
intense over 5 to 7 days, worsening if pneumonia develops in
patients [8]. Approximately, 1 out of 6 infected individuals
become seriously ill and develop difficulty in breathing, especially in the elderly with underlying health conditions [9].
A meta-analysis study of COVID-19 patients, as depicted
in Fig. 1, showed fever (88.8%) as the most common symptom, followed by dry cough (68%) and fatigue (33%) [10].
Other symptoms noted were productive cough (28.5%), SOB
(17%), muscle pain (14.4%), sore throat (11.4%), and headache (10.2%) [10]. The least common symptoms were diarrhea (4.4%), nausea and vomiting (4.1%), rhinorrhea (3.2%),
abdominal pain (0.16%), and chest pain (0.11%) [10].
Symptoms of COVID-19 may appear anytime from 2 to
14 days after exposure; therefore, 14-day quarantine is recommended [7]. The average incubation period for COVID-19 is
approximately 5.2 days [11]. In Wuhan, China, the most common symptoms observed from the onset of this outbreak include fever, cough, and fatigue, while some features that were
not so prevalent were sputum production, headache, hemoptysis, and gastrointestinal (GI) symptom such as diarrhea [12,
13]. Another study that was conducted in Beijing, China,
showed that the average age of patients with COVID-19 was
35.5 years and had a mean of 3.5 days from the onset of
symptoms to admission in the hospital [14]. The same study
also showed that fever was present in 87.5% of patients, which
persisted for 6.5 days, and symptoms resolved 2.5 days after a
negative test result [14].
Some individuals who are infected do not develop any
symptoms at all, and about 80% of positive cases recover
from the disease without any treatment [9]. However,
there have also been instances of transmissions of
COVID-19 from one person to another before the person
became aware of being sick, or the symptoms were so
mild that the person did not know he/she had the illness
[15]. It becomes essential to seek medical attention immediately if a person suspects that he/she may have been

infected or is a confirmed case of COVID-19 experiencing respiratory distress, has blue lips, is in constant pain,
or has pressure in the chest [7]. Also, it is important to
note that COVID-19 is more infectious than SARS-CoV
and MERS-CoV due to its numerous epidemiological and
biological characteristics [16].
Comorbidities
Due to COVID-19 being a relatively new and understudied
disease, the data available is limited. However, from the cases
that emerged, it was observed that comorbidities increase the
chances of infection [7]. Based on current information and
clinical expertise, the elderly, especially those in long-term
care facilities, and people of any age with serious underlying
medical conditions are at a greater risk of getting COVID-19
[7]. The elderly, a vulnerable population, with chronic health
conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular or lung disease
are not only at a higher risk of developing severe illness but
are also at an increased risk of death if they become ill [15].
People with underlying uncontrolled medical conditions such
as diabetes; hypertension; lung, liver, and kidney disease; cancer patients on chemotherapy; smokers; transplant recipients;
and patients taking steroids chronically are at increased risk of
COVID-19 infection [7].
A meta-analysis study on COVID-19 comorbidities, as
depicted in Fig. 2, had a total of 1786 patients, of which
1044 were male and 742 were female with a mean age of
41 years old [10]. The most common comorbidities identified in these patients were hypertension (15.8%),
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular conditions (11.7%),
and diabetes (9.4%) [10, 17]. The less common comorbidities were coexisting infection with HIV and hepatitis B
(1.5%), malignancy (1.5%), respiratory illnesses (1.4%),
renal disorders (0.8%), and immunodeficiencies (0.01%)
[10].
Patients with moderate to severe asthma are at a disadvantage because this virus affects their respiratory tracts,
leading to increased asthmatic attacks, pneumonia, and
acute respiratory distress [7]. According to the CDC’s morbidity and mortality weekly report, 34.6% of patients aged
18 to 49 years old have an underlying chronic lung disease,
such as asthma [6]. In Iran, a case study reported that genetic predisposition to COVID-19 can increase the probabilities of getting infected with SARS-CoV-2 and can lead
to death from this virus [18]. This genetic predisposition
was seen in 3 brothers in Iran who were 6 years apart in age
(54, 60, and 66) years who died due to COVID-19, despite
no identified comorbidities and living separately from one
another [18]. As of January 2, 2020, Wuhan, China, had 41
patients admitted to the hospital who tested positive for
COVID-19, of which 73% (30/41) were men with a median age of 49 years old, 66% (27/41) of these patients had
been exposed to the Huanan market, 32% (13/41) had underlying diseases such as diabetes 20% (8/41), hypertension 15% (6/41), and cardiovascular 15% (6/41) [12].
Patients who are HIV positive, along with a low CD4 count
and not on antiretroviral therapy, have a higher risk and
incidence of other medical issues including COVID-19 [7].

who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive,
taking antiretroviral treatment, and do not have a low
CD4 count will have the same risk of having COVID-19
as one without HIV [19, 20].
As depicted in Fig. 3, a population-based surveillance report via COVID-19-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance
Network (COVID-NET) reported clinical data on 1478
COVID-19-positive patient hospitalizations from March 1 to
March 30, 2020 [6]. Among the 1478 patients studied, 12% of
adults showed clinical data of underlying medical conditions
with the most prevalent being hypertension (49.7%) and obesity a close second (48.3%) [6]. Other medical conditions
included chronic lung disease (34.6%), diabetes mellitus
(28.3%), and cardiovascular diseases (27.8%) [6].
Outcome
COVID-19 can cause severe disease leading to hospitalization
in ICU and potentially death, especially in the elderly with
comorbidities [21]. According to the CDC, 8 out of 10 deaths
reported in the USA occurred in adults 65 years old and above
[7]. Roughly 80% of COVID-19-positive cases result in full
recovery from the illness without any hospitalizations or interventions [9]. There are still many facts that we do not know
about COVID-19 due to gaps in knowledge; therefore, many
studies are underway to better understand this virus [15].

in Fig. 4 [12]. Of the 41 patients with confirmed COVID-19 in
the hospital, 100% had pneumonia, 29% developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), 15% exhibited an acute
cardiac injury, and 12% acquired a secondary infection [12].
The majority of these patients (68%) were discharged, 17%
remained hospitalized, 10% ended up in the ICU, and 15%
ended in death [12].
From February 20 to March 5, 2020, a study was conducted in Evergreen, Washington, on the characteristics and outcomes of 21 critically ill patients with confirmed COVID-19
diagnosis [22]. This study showed that 71% of these patients
required mechanical ventilation and acute respiratory arrest
was seen in all of them [22]. Within 72 h of developing
ARDS, 53% of these patients showed increasing severity of
respiratory problems, leading to poor short-term outcomes
and a higher risk of death [22]. As of March 17, 2020, the
mortality rate was 67% in these patients, with 24% critically ill
and 9.5% discharged from hospital [22].
As shown in the CDC’s mortality and morbidity weekly
report in Fig. 5, case mortality increased as the patient’s age
increased [21, 23]. Among the age group ≤ 19 years, no ICU
admission or mortality was reported [21]. COVID-19 has also
been noticed in children, but the disease took a more moderate
course when compared with adults. The prognosis was also
seemingly better, and deaths were infrequent [24].
On April 29, 2020, WHO reported over 3 million confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide, with over 200,000 of
these cases resulting in mortality [25]. The majority of these

deaths are within the USA with over 50,000, followed by Italy
with over 25,000 and Spain with over 20,000 [25]. New York
is being hit the hardest by the novel coronavirus spreading
across the USA, with more cases and deaths per capita than
any other state. Table 1 reports that over 86% of COVID-19
deaths involved at least one comorbidity, according to the
New York State Department of Health [26].
Discussion
Multiple comorbidities are associated with the severity of
COVID-19 disease progression. Many of the poorer outcomes
for COVID-19 have been related to cardiovascular comorbid
conditions [27]. However, this may be a direct result of the
cardiovascular condition itself or attributed to other comorbidities along with a cardiovascular condition [27]. Patients with
type 2 diabetes were also more likely to have increased severity of COVID-19 [28]. In a cohort study of 7337 patients with
COVID-19 with and without type 2 diabetes, it was shown
that those with type 2 diabetes required increased interventions for their hospital stay versus those that were nondiabetic
[28]. It was shown that those with poorer blood glucose control had an all-around increased mortality rate than those with
better glucose control [28]. The study concluded that patients
with blood glucose specifically those in the range of 3.9 to
10.0 mmol/L had overall decreased composite adverse events
and mortality [28]. It was noted that poor blood glucose control resulted in a substantially increased risk of complications
and death [28]. Among other comorbidities, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has also been associated with
poor disease progression. A meta-analysis of multiple studies
in China found that there was a four-fold increase in mortality
in patients with preexisting COPD that were diagnosed with
COVID-19 [29]. In this analysis, the smoking status of patients and severity of COVID-19 were also studied. Only one
study was found to have an association with smoking and
severe course of COVID-19 [29]. After this study was removed, there was no significant association with smoking
and severe COVID-19 disease [29].
Patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure associated with the novel coronavirus may be
linked to a prothrombotic coagulopathy [30]. The autopsy of
COVID-19-related deaths revealed dispersed microthrombi in
the pulmonary vasculature, demonstrating an occlusive etiology of respiratory failure [30]. A 38 to 100% improvement
was noted in three cases with COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure, following treatment with intravenous (IV) antithrombotic
alteplase [30]. The results, although reassuring, were transient
in two of the three cases with recovery succumbing posttreatment [30]. The use of anti-thrombolytic therapy needs to be
further studied to ascertain that the results are due to treatment
and not chance alone [30]. A retrospective meta-analysis including 1558 COVID-19 patients was conducted until
March 1, 2020, on subjects with underlying comorbidities
and the risk for acquiring COVID-19 [31]. Common comorbidities such as hypertension, COPD, diabetes, and cardiocerebrovascular disease were observed to be the more significant risk factors in subjects when compared with other underlying disease states [31]. Other than intense supportive measures, a definitive treatment has yet to be identified [31].
Authorities speculate that subjects with comorbidities were
linked to a more severe disease outcome when infected with
the novel coronavirus when compared with patients with no
underlying disease [31]. The study was met with barriers due
to the diminutive sample size and some subjects having more
than one underlying comorbidity [31]. In literature and earlier
research, underlying diseases increase the mortality rate in
patients who acquired COVID-19 with cardiac disease and
diabetes being the most significant risk factors [32]. Once
again, insufficient sample size and inadequate time have led
to limitations in the data collected [32].
Conclusion
Over 180 countries have been affected by COVID-19,
resulting in mass death worldwide. As cases evolve globally,
it has been noted that persons with underlying chronic illnesses are more likely to contract the virus and become severely ill.
Due to SARS CoV-2 being a relatively new virus, the data
available is limited. However, patients with comorbidities
have more deteriorating outcomes compared with patients
without. COVID-19 patients with history of hypertension,
obesity, chronic lung disease, diabetes, and cardiovascular

disease have the worst prognosis and most often end up with
deteriorating outcomes such as ARDS and pneumonia. Also,
elderly patients in long-term care facilities, chronic kidney
disease patients, and cancer patients are not only at risk for
contracting the virus, but there is a significantly increased risk
of death among these groups of patients.
Of the cases reported worldwide, symptoms of COVID-19
ranged from mild respiratory disease to severe illness, which
requires intubation and mechanical ventilation. Since there is a
period where the patient is asymptomatic, and the incubation
period is between 2 and 14 days, it is difficult to establish an
early diagnosis, much less curb the transmission of the infection if the patient is unknowingly exposed. However, within
this period, if respiratory symptoms develop, it is important to
seek immediate care.
Therefore, patients with comorbidities should take all necessary precautions to avoid getting infected with SARS CoV2, as they usually have the worst prognosis. These precautions
include regular handwashing with soap and water or use of
alcohol-based hand sanitizer, limiting person-to-person contact and practicing social distancing, wearing a face mask in
public places, and overall limiting going to public areas at this
time unless it is necessary. Hence, there is a need for a global
public health campaign to raise awareness, on reducing the
burden of these comorbidity illnesses causing deaths in
COVID-19-infected patients.
