Abstract
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disease of unknown aetiology
characterised by inflammation and fibrosis of the biliary tree. The mean age at diagnosis is 40 years
and men are affected twice as often as women. There is a reported annual incidence of PSC of 0.9–
1.31/100,000 and point prevalence of 8.5–13.6/100,000. The onset of PSC is usually insidious and
many patients are asymptomatic at diagnosis or have mild symptoms only such as fatigue, abdominal
discomfort and pruritus In late stages, splenomegaly and jaundice may be a feature. In most, the
disease progresses to cirrhosis and liver failure. Cholangiocarcinoma develops in 8–30% of patients.
PSC is thought to be immune mediated and is often associated with inflammatory bowel disease,
especially ulcerative colitis. The disease is diagnosed on typical cholangiographic and histological
findings and after exclusion of secondary sclerosing cholangitis. Median survival has been estimated
to be 12 years from diagnosis in symptomatic patients. Patients who are asymptomatic at diagnosis,
the majority of whom will develop progressive disease, have a survival rate greater than 70% at 16
years after diagnosis. Liver transplantation remains the only effective therapeutic option for
patients with end-stage liver disease from PSC, although high dose ursodeoxycholic acid may have
a beneficial effect.
Disease name
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).
Definition
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disease of intra and/or extrahepatic bile ducts. A
concentric obliterative fibrosis occurs which leads to bile
duct strictures, which in turn can progress to biliary cirrhosis and liver failure. Cholangiocarcinoma develops in
8–30% of patients [1,2].
Secondary sclerosing cholangitis (SSC) is a sclerosing
cholangitis that occurs secondary to a known pathogenic
process or injury such as obstruction of the bile ducts due
to tumour or gallstones; surgical, chemical or ischaemic
injury; bacterial infections or congenital abnormalities.
SSC has clinical features similar to those of PSC.
Associated diseases
Primary association

Complications
Colorectal cancer, cholangiocarcinoma.
Epidemiology
PSC occurs with a 2:1 male predominance. Little is known
about the incidence and prevalence of PSC. There is a
reported annual incidence of PSC of 0.9–1.31/100,000
and point prevalence of 8.5–13.6/100,000, which appears
to be increasing [3-5]. This probably reflects ascertainment bias rather than a true increase. Patients usually
present in the third to fifth decade but PSC is recognised
as a cause of chronic liver disease in children. It is also
unusual to find more than one family member affected.
PSC is frequently associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially ulcerative colitis and, less often,
with colonic Crohn's disease. Approximately three quarters of Caucasian patients with PSC have IBD [6,7] and 2–
7.5% of patients with ulcerative colitis have PSC [8-10].
This may be an underestimate as patients with PSC may
have normal liver function tests. The symptoms of IBD
may predate or follow the diagnosis of PSC. The clinical
course of ulcerative colitis in PSC patients is often mild
and there is a higher prevalence of rectal sparing compared with controls (52% vs 6%). There is also a higher
prevalence of backwash ileitis (51% vs 7%) [11]. The risk
of colonic dysplasia and colorectal cancer is higher in
those with PSC. A long history of IBD is also a risk factor
for cholangiocarcinoma development. Colectomy does
not alter the course of PSC [12].
Clinical description and diagnostic methods
The diagnosis of PSC is based on a combination of clinical
features and cholestatic liver function tests with typical
cholangiographic findings and confirmed by characteristic histological abnormalities. In small duct disease,
patients have typical biochemical and histological features but a normal cholangiogram. All secondary causes of
cholangitis and other causes of liver disease should be
excluded.
Clinical features
The clinical course of PSC is highly variable. Patients may
present with abnormal liver function tests on a background of IBD. Patients may remain asymptomatic for
years or may develop symptoms of fatigue, abdominal
discomfort, pruritus and weight loss. Ultimately patients
may develop liver failure or cholangiocarcinoma.
Examination may be normal early in disease. As the disease progresses, patients may develop hepatomegaly. In
late stages splenomegaly and jaundice may be a feature.
Signs of liver failure and portal hypertension are late signs.
Laboratory tests
Alkaline phosphatase is usually raised and transaminases
and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) can also be
elevated. Patients with PSC often have marked fluctuations in liver function tests and these are not predictive of
prognosis [29]. Results of hepatic synthetic function, i.e.
serum albumin and prothrombin time (PT), become
abnormal with advanced disease.
Some immunological tests may help in the diagnosis of
PSC. Hypergammaglobulinaemia occurs in a third of
patients and immunoglobulin M (IgM) levels are
increased in 50% of patients with advanced disease.
Imaging
Once abnormal biochemistry is revealed on the liver function tests (LFTs), diagnosis is made mainly on the basis of
the cholangiogram. A magnetic resonance cholangiogram
(MRCP) is being used more frequently for diagnosis and
endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERCP) is performed more as a therapeutic procedure.
Typical cholangiographic findings show diffuse stricturing
of intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts with dilatation
of the areas in between (See Figure 1).

More advanced disease is associated with long strictures.
The presence of a dominant stricture should raise the possibility of a cholangiocarcinoma as a complication of PSC.
In small duct disease the cholangiogram will be normal.
Ultrasound can be helpful in excluding other causes of biliary obstruction such as gallstones and malignancy.
Histology
In early stages, changes associated with PSC can be focal
and may be missed on liver biopsy or the changes may be
non-specific. The characteristic finding is of concentric
"onion-skin" fibrosis surrounding the bile ducts (See Figure 2). Other bile duct abnormalities may include necrosis of epithelial cells, inflammatory infiltrates and fibrosis.
There may be intrahepatic bile duct proliferation with
ductopaenia or oedema in some portal tracts. In advanced
cases, loss of bile ducts can be a feature (vanishing bile
duct syndrome). The parenchyma usually shows non-specific changes [30]. Copper storage protein may be seen in
advanced cases.
Differential diagnosis
Differential diagnosis should exclude other liver diseases
such as autoimmune hepatitis (can coexist with PSC,
termed overlap syndrome), primary biliary cirrhosis, viral
hepatitis, as well as secondary causes of cholangitis.
Aetiology and pathogenesis
The aetiology and pathogenesis of PSC are still unknown.
The following may be important in the development of
PSC.
Immunology
Lymphocytic portal tract infiltration and associations with
human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes and autoantibodies are suggestive of an immune mediated basis for
this disease. Autoimmune diseases are more frequent in
patients with PSC than in patients with IBD who do not
have PSC. The most common are diabetes mellitus, coeliac disease and Grave's disease [17]. Rheumatoid arthritis
has also been described in association with PSC and may
be a clinical marker for those at high risk of rapid progression to cirrhosis [18].
A high prevalence of atypical anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic
antibodies (ANCA) are present in the serum in PSC (33–
88%). They are also found in ulcerative colitis (60–87%)
and type I autoimmune hepatitis (50–96%) [17,18].
These antibodies are not involved in the pathogenesis of
PSC and probably represent an epiphenomenon. Other
autoantibodies can be detected in patients with PSC but
their presence is not useful for diagnosis or prognosis and,
therefore, is of unclear relevance.
Hypergammaglobulinaemia occurs in one third of
patients with PSC and IgM levels are increased in 50% of
advanced cases [19]. Other immunological changes
include a decrease in circulating T cells and an increased
ratio of CD4 to CD8 cells.
Grant et al. hypothesised that T Lymphocytes derived from
the inflamed gut act as long-lived memory cells [20]. They
enter the enterohepatic circulation to gain access to the
liver and cause disease when then activated by a certain
stimulus [20].
Genetics
PSC is probably acquired through inheriting a combination of genetic polymorphisms that interrelate to cause
disease susceptibility. Six different HLA molecules have so
far been associated with PSC [21]. Non-MHC (major histocompatibility complex) genes may also play a part but
data remains controversial. The importance of genetics in
PSC is not fully understood and still being actively
researched.
Infections/toxins
The association of PSC and IBD led to Vierling's hypothesis that PSC may be triggered by infections or toxins acting
as molecular mimics entering the portal circulation
through a permeable colon [22]. The Kupffer cells are activated and cause activated neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes and fibroblasts to be attracted, which in turn
could then lead to ischaemia, atrophy, cholestasis, fibrosis
and then cirrhosis of the biliary cells. However, as PSC can
run an independent course from IBD, this suggests bacteraemia on its own is not the cause of PSC development.
Smoking/surgery
There is a well established increased risk of ulcerative colitis in non-smokers when compared to controls. PSC also
seems to be a disease of non-smokers, independently of
whether the patient has IBD. Previous tonsillectomy may
be associated with a decreased risk of PSC. Whilst appendicectomy is not associated with a decreased risk, it may
be associated with a delayed onset of PSC. Further studies
are required to analyse this association [23-26].
Management including treatment
Since the aetiology and pathogenesis of PSC are still
unknown, establishing treatment strategies is difficult.
Treatments should ultimately improve symptoms and
aim to improve survival. Liver transplant remains the only
definitive treatment.
Ursodeoxycholic acid
Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is a naturally occurring
bile acid that improves liver enzyme function in PSC but
its effect on liver histology remains controversial. In PSC,

Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2006, 1:41 http://www.OJRD.com/content/1/1/41
Page 4 of 7
(page number not for citation purposes)
there is evidence that high doses (20–30 mg/kg/d) of
UDCA may be more effective than moderate doses (10–
15 mg/kg/d) at slowing progression of liver fibrosis and
cholangiographic appearances [27,28]. The results of a
controlled trial with high dose UDCA for the treatment of
PSC has shown a trend towards a prolonged survival in
the high dose UDCA group [29]. Studies using immunosuppressant therapy in combination with UDCA show
some beneficial effects and need further analysis, as does
treatment with antibiotics. In a few patients, features of
both PSC and autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) may be
present and this is one of the so-called overlap syndromes.
This overlap syndrome, in particular, may be more common in children. Immunosuppression appears to be beneficial in this group [30-32].
Dysplasia and cancer
The risk of colorectal dysplasia and colorectal cancer is
increased in those with ulcerative colitis who have PSC
[33]. Although not evidence-based, current consensus is
that these patients should be entered into a surveillance
programme and undergo yearly colonoscopies once the
diagnosis of PSC has been made. UDCA treatment in
patients with PSC and ulcerative colitis has been shown to
decrease the risk of colorectal dysplasia and colorectal
cancer [34,35].
Cholangiocarcinoma develops in 8–30% of adult patients
with PSC. Hepatocellular carcinoma and gallbladder carcinoma have also been described in PSC. There is also a
suggestion of an increased risk of pancreatic carcinoma.
Hepatobiliary malignancy is only detected in a proportion
of those it is suspected in [36]. Of those PSC patients with
cancer, one third will already have hepatobiliary malignancy at the time of or within a year after PSC diagnosis.
The risk of hepatobiliary carcinoma is constant after the
first year of PSC diagnosis with an incidence rate of 1.5%
per year [37]. Measurement and detection of elevated
CA19-9 may be a signal to investigate further, but it can
also be raised in benign biliary disease [23,38]. Biliary
Mac-2 binding protein has been suggested as a novel diagnostic marker for biliary tract carcinoma, especially when
used in combination with biliary CA19-9 levels [39]. Early
detection of cholangiocarcinoma is difficult as it may be
indistinguishable on cholangiogram from a benign dominant stricture. Brush cytology of dominant strictures has
not been shown to have a predictive value [40].
Other complications
Pruritus is a frequent complication and can be disabling.
Agents such as cholestyramine (4–16 g/d), rifampicin or
naltrexone may all be used [41,42]. Extra corporeal albumin dialysis has been tried in small numbers of patients
with cholestasis, and appears to be an effective alternative
for the treatment of patients with pruritus who do not
respond to other therapeutic methods [43].
People with advanced PSC are often deficient in the fatsoluble vitamins A, D, E, K and replacement therapy can
be given. In osteoporosis, physical exercise and maintenance of adequate calcium and vitamin D may be sufficient in the early stages. Patients with more advanced
disease, especially those with IBD, should undergo bone
density scanning. Bisphosphonates may be of value.
Recurrent bacterial cholangitis is common, especially in
those with strictures, and should be treated with broadspectrum antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin, which has a
high biliary tract penetration. Prophylaxis with oral quinolones may decrease the frequency of cholangitis in
those who have a history of recurrent episodes. Cholelithiasis and choledocholithiasis probably occur secondary to
chronic cholestasis. ERCP can be used for balloon dilatation or stent placement in the treatment of dominant
strictures, and may provide relief of symptoms [44].
Surgery
Liver transplant is an option in the treatment of PSC for
those who develop advanced disease. It is difficult to evaluate these patients with regard to timing of transplantation, as disease course is unpredictable. At least 20% of
patients undergoing liver transplantation develop recurrent PSC within 5 years [45]. The 5-year survival post
transplant is around 75% [46]. The presence of cholangiocarcinoma is traditionally a contraindication to transplant but one study shows a 5 year survival of around 35%
for those with cholangiocarcinoma. Thus, if cholangiocarcinoma is only suspected and not definitely diagnosed,
the patient should be considered for transplant. Incidental finding of a cholangiocarcinoma during transplant
does not affect patient survival significantly [36,47].
Inflammatory bowel disease symptoms may become
more severe post transplantation prompting proctocolectomy, and 5–10% of those with IBD develop colorectal
cancer after liver transplant [48].
Prognosis
Median survival has been estimated to be 12 years from
diagnosis in symptomatic patients [1,6,7]. Patients who
are asymptomatic at diagnosis, the majority of whom will
develop progressive disease, have a survival rate greater
than 70% at 16 years after diagnosis [49].
Patients who have cholestatic liver function tests and a
clinical diagnosis of PSC with features consistent with this
diagnosis on the liver biopsy, but who have a normal
cholangiogram, have small duct PSC; 6–11% of the PSC
population have small duct disease. Patients with small
duct disease follow a benign course and have a favourable

prognosis with regard to survival, transplantation and
development of cholangiocarcinoma. The small duct disease does, however, progress in a small number (12%) to
large duct disease [50-52].
Unresolved questions
The aetiology of PSC is still unknown.
More needs to be known about the natural history of PSC.
The availability of predictors for development of colonic
and bile duct cancer would be useful.
