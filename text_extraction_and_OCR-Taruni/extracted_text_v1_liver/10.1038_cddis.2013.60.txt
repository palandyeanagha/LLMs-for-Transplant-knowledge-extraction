Targeting cellular metabolism to improve cancer
therapeutics
Y Zhao1,4, EB Butler2,4 and M Tan*,2,3
The metabolic properties of cancer cells diverge significantly from those of normal cells. Energy production in cancer cells is
abnormally dependent on aerobic glycolysis. In addition to the dependency on glycolysis, cancer cells have other atypical
metabolic characteristics such as increased fatty acid synthesis and increased rates of glutamine metabolism. Emerging
evidence shows that many features characteristic to cancer cells, such as dysregulated Warburg-like glucose metabolism, fatty
acid synthesis and glutaminolysis are linked to therapeutic resistance in cancer treatment. Therefore, targeting cellular
metabolism may improve the response to cancer therapeutics and the combination of chemotherapeutic drugs with cellular
metabolism inhibitors may represent a promising strategy to overcome drug resistance in cancer therapy. Recently, several
review articles have summarized the anticancer targets in the metabolic pathways and metabolic inhibitor-induced cell death
pathways, however, the dysregulated metabolism in therapeutic resistance, which is a highly clinical relevant area in cancer
metabolism research, has not been specifically addressed. From this unique angle, this review article will discuss the
relationship between dysregulated cellular metabolism and cancer drug resistance and how targeting of metabolic enzymes,
such as glucose transporters, hexokinase, pyruvate kinase M2, lactate dehydrogenase A, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, fatty
acid synthase and glutaminase can enhance the efficacy of common therapeutic agents or overcome resistance to
chemotherapy or radiotherapy.

The metabolic properties of cancer cells are different from
those of normal cells. Cancer cells are more dependent on
aerobic glycolysis, fatty acid synthesis and glutaminolysis for
proliferation.1 This difference suggests that targeting metabolic dependence could be a selective approach to treat
cancer patients. In 1956, Warburg observed that the rate of
glycolysis was abnormally high in cancer cells, yet a smaller
fraction of this glucose is broken down by oxidative
phosphorylation. This ‘Warburg effect’ indicates that cancer
cells prefer glycolytic breakdown of glucose for energy, rather
than mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.1–9 Although the
molecular mechanisms that define the Warburg effect are not

yet fully understood, the increased glycolysis observed in
cancer cells is well accepted to be important for the support of
malignant phenotypes (Box 1).8
In addition to the dependency on glycolysis, cancer cells
exhibit other metabolic characteristics such as increased fatty
acid synthesis and glutamine metabolism. Enhanced fatty
acid synthesis provides rapidly proliferating tumor cells lipids
for membrane biogenesis, conferring both a growth and
survival advantage.10 Similarly, cancer cells are extremely
sensitive to glutamine deprivation and cannot proliferate in
culture without it. ‘Glutamine addiction’ results in enhanced
production of byproducts necessary for rapidly proliferating
cells, such as amino-acid precursors.11,12
Recently many review articles on cancer and metabolism13–21 have been published. However, dysregulated
metabolism in therapeutic resistance, a highly clinical relevant
area in cancer research, has not been specifically addressed.
Here we will discuss the relationship between cellular metabolism and drug resistance in cancer cells and how to improve
cancer therapeutics and to overcome drug resistance by
targeting dysregulated metabolic enzymes and pathways.
Dysregulated Metabolism has been Linked to Drug
Resistance
The ability to reduce chemoresistance would be a significant
boon for cancer patients, demonstrating the importance of
research into the mechanisms underlying how chemoresistance arises (Box 2). Mounting evidence supports the idea that
dysregulated cellular metabolism is linked to drug resistance in
cancer therapy.22–25 In the glycolytic pathway, lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) contributes to paclitaxel/trastuzumab
resistance in breast cancer and pyruvate dehydrogenase
Box 1 The Warburg effect and cancer.
The Warburg effect is defined by an increased utilization of
glucose via glycolysis as a cellular resource, and is a
common phenotype of cancerous cells. The characteristic
enhanced glucose uptake observed in cancer cells has
been used to detect and image cancers via PET detection
of 2-18F-2-deoxyglucose, which preferentially concentrates within tumors as a result of their rapid uptake of
glucose. Although normal cells require growth factor
signaling to utilize available resources for anything more
than preservation, cancer cells often display dysregulated
metabolism and freely take advantage of the abundant
resources available within the body. Breaking these
resources down via glycolysis and glutaminolysis is more
to feed and protect the cell as it grows than provide energy
to maintain cellular functions. Intermediates produced
through glycolysis and glutaminolysis are diverted to
biosynthetic pathways that are necessary to produce the
basic building blocks of cellular growth. Carbon and
nitrogen from glucose and glutamine fuel nucleoside and
amino-acid synthesis, whereas pyruvate feeds the citric
acid cycle supporting continued fatty acid synthesis by
supplying acetyl- and malonyl-CoA. The metabolic
changes, such as the Warburg effect, observed in cancer
allow readily available resources to be converted into
biomass in an efficient manner. This metabolic shift
releases cells from the typical restraints on growth, and
provides a potential way to distinguish them from healthy
cells – allowing for treatments that may be selective for
cancerous cells. In addition, there are many links between
cancer metabolism and drug resistance and compounds
that influence dysregulated cellular metabolism often have
the ability to increase the effect or reduce resistance to
current anticancer treatments.
Box 2 Anticancer agents that can be potentiated by
metabolic inhibitors.
In general, anticancer agents work by interrupting critical
events within the cellular lifecycle resulting in either
irreversible damage to the cell or induction of apoptotic
pathways. DNA replication is directly or indirectly a feature
targeted by a wide variety of compounds. Both the cisplatin
and temozolomide families of compounds modify the DNA,
either by forming bulky adducts or by alkylating the bases,
preying on the limited or compromised DNA repair ability
that is common within many cancers. Similarly, nucleoside
mimics such as gemcitabine and 5-FU disrupt replication
by inhibiting the synthesis of deoxynucleotides – through
the inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase or thymidylate
synthase, respectively. More indirect methods of disrupting DNA replication target the topoisomerases, using
families of compounds such as adriamycin and doxorubicin. These intercalating drugs stop DNA replication by
stabilizing topoisomerase II, which prevents progression of
the replication fork and ultimately leads to cellular death.
Similarly, taxol class drugs indirectly target replication by
stabilizing tubulin. This blocks progression of the cellular
cycle, as metaphase chromosomes can no longer achieve
the correct configuration, ultimately resulting in cell
checkpoint activation and/or stalling of the cell cycle.
Although DNA replication is a common target for current
clinical anticancer drugs, it is not the only clinically effective
target. Other classes of drugs affect the signaling pathways that have gone awry within cancer. The unchecked
activation of these signaling networks often results in
increased angiogenesis and unregulated growth. Selective
estrogen receptor modulators, such as tamoxifen and
raloxifen, modulate signaling through the estrogen receptor-mediated pathways and have been particularly effective for patients with certain types of breast cancer.
Similarly, the EGFR family has been effectively targeted
using drugs such as lapatinib (tyrosine kinase inhibitor
active against EGFR and HER2) and trastuzumab (a
humanized antibody targeting the HER2 receptor). The
EGFR family, and specifically HER2, are aberrantly active
in many types of cancers and initiate signaling pathways
that lead the cells to grow aggressively and often results in
a less positive outcome than seen in non-HER2 expressing
tumors. We anticipate that as the molecular mechanisms
defining differing subsets of cancer are better understood
new drug families exploiting those characteristics will be
successfully developed for clinical use.

kinase 3 (PDK3) contributes to hypoxia-induced drug resistance in cervical and colon cancer. Fatty acid synthase
(FASN), a key complex catalyzing fatty acid synthesis, is
linked to acquired docetaxel/trastuzumab/adriamycin resistance in breast cancer or intrinsic gemcitabine and radiation
resistance in pancreatic cancer. Finally, glutaminolysis is
linked to cisplatin resistance via the activation of mammalian
target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling in gastric
cancer (Table 1). In this review, we will discuss the role of
these enzymes or processes in drug resistance in detail below.
Targeting Cellular Metabolism to Improve Cancer
Therapeutics
Targeting glycolytic enzymes. As a central energetic
resource for the cell, glucose metabolism is quite complex.
Many enzymes contribute to the series of reactions
necessary for the glycolytic breakdown of glucose. Below
we will discuss glycolytic inhibition as an anticancer strategy
in the context of selected components of the glycolytic
pathway, such as glucose transporters (GLUTs), hexokinase
(HK), pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) and LDHA.
Glucose transporters. The first rate-limiting step of glucose
metabolism is the transport of glucose across the plasma
membrane. The GLUT family of proteins is responsible for
this, and are often found dysregulated or overexpressed in
malignant cells.26 The human GLUT family consists of 14
members (GLUT1-14 or SLC2A1-14).26–28 Here we will focus
on targeting GLUT1, GLUT3 and GLUT4 for improving
cancer therapy.
WZB117 is an inhibitor of GLUT1 that decreases glucose
uptake, intracellular ATP levels and glycolytic enzymes
leading to a lowered rate of glycolysis and cellular growth.
Exogenous ATP rescues growth of WZB117-treated cancer
cells, suggesting that reduction of ATP is an important
mechanism of WZB117’s anticancer effect. WZB117
also induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress leading to
cell-cycle arrest. The combination of WZB117 and cisplatin or
paclitaxel displayed synergistic anticancer effects
(Table 1).29,30 Under hypoxia, the GLUT1 inhibitor phloretin
significantly enhances daunorubicin’s anticancer effects
(Table 1) and overcomes hypoxia-conferred drug resistance.
Inhibition of glucose uptake by phloretin sensitizes P-glycoprotein overexpressed doxorubicin-resistant cells to daunorubicin via enhancing daunorubicin-induced apoptosis only
under hypoxia.27
Multiple myeloma (MM) cells are dependent on GLUT4
activity for basal glucose consumption, maintenance of Mcl-1
protein levels, growth and viability. Ritonavir displays

off-target inhibitory effects on GLUT4 and inhibits glucose
consumption and proliferation by reducing Mcl-1 expression
to induce apoptosis. Ritonavir also inhibits viability of primary
myeloma cells and increases the sensitivity to doxorubicin
(Table 1).28 Temozolomide is used with radiation and
chemotherapy to treat glioblastoma, yet nearly all glioblastoma patients develop resistance. Long-term treatment of
glioblastoma cells with temozolomide in vitro induces partial
resistance in vivo through upregulation of GLUT3, suggesting
involvement in temozolomide resistance and that selective
targeting of GLUT3 could delay the acquisition of such
resistance in glioblastoma cells.31 Inhibiting glucose uptake
may potentiate cancer therapeutics or overcome hypoxia/
drug-induced resistance.
Hexokinase. HK has important roles in both glycolysis and
apoptosis and inhibitors of HK, such as 2-deoxyglucose (2-
DG), 3-bromopyruvate (3-BrPA) and lonidamine (LND) are in
pre-clinical and early phase clinical trials. The effects of 2-
DG, 3-BrPA and LND on cell death in combination with
chemotherapy or radiotherapy have been reviewed in
detail.17 We will discuss the impact of these inhibitors on
cell death and their use to combat drug resistance.
2-DG is a glucose analog that is phosphorylated by HK to 2-
DG-phosphate, which cannot be further metabolized. Accumulation of 2-DG inhibits glycolysis causing ATP depletion,
cell cycle inhibition and cell death.32,33 Under normoxic
conditions, 2-DG can interfere with N-linked glycosylation
and induce an unfolded protein response, leading to
subsequent induction of some proapoptotic BH3-only proteins.17,34 There are no ongoing clinical trials using 2-DG as a
single agent as in some systems it does not have a significant
effect on tumor growth in vivo.
35 However, combining 2-DG
with radiation or chemotherapeutic treatments potentiates the
tumor-destroying effects and enhances the clinical efficacy.36
Bcl-2 family proteins have an important role in the regulation
of apoptosis, tumorigenesis and cellular response to cancer
therapeutics. Bcl-2 family proteins are divided into three
groups: anti-apoptotic members (Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Bcl-w, Mcl-1
and A1); pro-apoptotic members (Bax and Bak); and those
with only a BH3 domain that promote apoptosis by binding
anti-apoptotic proteins (Bad, Bid, Bim, Noxa and Puma).37
BH3-mimetics, such as ABT-737 and ABT-263, are smallmolecule inhibitors of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Bcl-w, but not Mcl-1.
Several recent studies have demonstrated that 2-DG or LND
enhances ABT-263/737-induced apoptosis both in vitro and
in vivo (Table 1).38–40 There are two proposed mechanisms
explaining the effect of 2-DG on ABT-263/737-induced
apoptosis. In the first 2-DG decreases Mcl-1 levels indirectly
by inhibiting glycolysis and depleting ATP levels, leading to
activation of AMP-activated protein kinase and inhibition of
Mcl-1 translation.38,39,41 In the second mechanism, 2-DG
weakens the interaction between Bak and Mcl-1, which
increases the ability of ABT-263/737 to release Bak from the
Mcl-1/Bcl-XL/Bak heterotrimer, thus inducing apoptosis.40
Both 2-DG and ABT-737 are well tolerated by patients and in
clinical trials, suggesting 2-DG-ABT-737 co-treatment has the
potential to be developed in treating ABT-737 resistance.
Trastuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against
ErbB2 and has shown efficacy treating ErbB2-positive breast
cancer patients, yet acquired trastuzumab resistance occurs
in most patients.42–48 Our previous studies showed that
overexpression of ErbB2 promotes glycolysis and increases
their sensitivity to glycolytic inhibition.49 Trastuzumab-resistant human cells also have increased glucose uptake and
lactate production, indicative of increased glycolysis. Trastuzumab also inhibits glycolysis via downregulation of HSF1 and
LDHA in breast cancer (Figure 1).23 We found 2-DG/
trastuzumab combination therapy synergistically inhibits
growth of both trastuzumab-sensitive and trastuzumabresistant human breast cancers in vitro and in vivo
(Table 1), because of more efficient glycolysis inhibition.23
These results suggest that 2-DG can effectively enhance
efficacy of trastuzumab in treating ErbB2-positive human
breast cancer cells and overcome trastuzumab resistance.
3-BrPA is a glycolysis inhibitor that targets HKII and
depletes cellular ATP reserves, a key determinant of
chemoresistance in certain cancer types.50,51 In leukemia
and MM cells increased glycolysis raises ATP levels, which
activates ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and
confers drug resistance via enhanced drug efflux activity
(Figure 1). 3-BrPA causes ATP depletion, decreasing ABC
transporter activity and drug efflux, therefore enhancing drug
retention in cells producing preferential cell death in malignant
cells. Glycolysis inhibition by 3-BrPA not only enhances the
cytotoxic effects of daunorubicin and doxorubicin, but also
markedly suppresses tumor growth when used with doxorubicin to treat MM-bearing mice (Table 1).52 In addition to
activating ABC transporters, increased ATP levels from
elevated glycolysis upregulate HIF-1a and enhance HIF-1amediated signaling, which can confer chemoresistance
(Figure 1). ATP depletion by 3-BrPA partially reversed the
resistant phenotype and resensitized cells to chemotherapeutic agents such as oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU;
Table 1).53 These findings demonstrate that glycolysis
inhibition by 3-BrPA causes ATP depletion, which can
improve cancer therapeutics or overcome chemoresistance.
Most treatment failure in childhood acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL) is ascribed to glucocorticoid (e.g., prednisolone) resistance. Increased glycolysis is directly associated to
glucocorticoid resistance and inhibition of glycolysis by 2-DG,
3-BrPA or LND increases prednisolone-induced toxicity in
leukemia cells (Table 1).54 Importantly, 2-DG can reverse
glucocorticoid resistance in primary leukemia cells isolated
from pediatric ALL patients.54
Pyruvate kinase M2. Pyruvate kinase (PK) is the last ratelimiting enzyme in the glycolytic pathway and catalyzes the
conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate and ADP into pyruvate
and ATP. There are four isoforms of PK in mammals (M1,
M2, L and R), which are expressed in different cell types.14,55
PKM2 is expressed predominantly in tumor cells56 and is
important for cancer metabolism and tumor growth.57
Several studies showed a negative correlation between
PKM2 expression and drug resistance.58–60 Decreased
PKM2 protein and activity is linked to cisplatin resistance
while suppression of PKM2 expression by siRNA increased
cisplatin resistance.60 Both PKM2 mRNA and protein levels
are downregulated in oxaliplatin-resistant cells and PKM2
mRNA levels are inversely correlated with oxaliplatin

resistance in a panel of eight colorectal cancer cell lines. Low
PKM2 mRNA levels in patients are associated with high p53
protein levels and predict poor response to oxaliplatin.59 In
contrast, PKM2 levels are significantly upregulated in
secreted proteins of the 5-FU-resistant colon cancer cell
line. Moreover, increased PKM2 is also observed in sera and
tissues from colorectal cancer patients with poor response to
5-FU. These findings suggested that upregulation of PKM2 is
linked to 5-FU resistance in colon cancer.61
Changes in PKM2 expression are associated with drug
resistance in different tumor. This indicates that PKM2 is a
potential target for adjuvant cancer therapy. For example,
shRNA targeting PKM2 improves the therapeutic efficacy of
cisplatin by increasing apoptosis and inhibiting proliferation
(Table 1).62 Silencing of PKM2 enhances the efficacy of
docetaxel because of increased inhibition of proliferation and
apoptosis-inducing activity both in vitro and in vivo (Table 1).63
A possible mechanism for the sensitization of lung cancer
cells to docetaxel is that shPKM2 decreases ATP levels
leading to intracellular accumulation of docetaxel.63 These
results indicated that targeting PKM2 can effectively improve
the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs.
Lactate dehydrogenase A. LDHA catalyzes the final step in
the glycolytic pathway, the conversion of pyruvate and NADH
to lactate and NAD þ , and has a critical role in tumor
maintenance. Knockdown of LDHA in tumor cells produces
increased mitochondrial respiration, decreased cellular ability
to proliferate under hypoxic conditions, and suppressed
tumorigenicity.64 LDHA knockdown in the fumarate hydratase knockdown background results in increased apoptosis
via ROS production, resulting in a reduction in tumor growth
and indicating that LDHA might be a promising therapeutic
target.65 Inhibition of LDHA by siRNA or FX11 treatment
reduces ATP levels and induces significant oxidative stress
resulting in cell death.66 Importantly, combining FX11 with
FK866, an NAD þ synthesis inhibitor, induces lymphoma
regression in a xenograft model (Table 1).66
Paclitaxel (taxol) is a widely used chemotherapeutic agent
in the treatment of a variety of human cancers (Table 1).
LDHA expression and activity is higher in taxol-resistant
breast cancer cells than in taxol-sensitive cells, and downregulation of LDHA resensitizes taxol-resistant cells to taxol.
Taxol-resistant cells are more sensitive to oxamate, a
pyruvate analog that inhibits glycolysis by inhibiting the
conversion of pyruvate to lactate. These results indicate that
LDHA and lactate metabolism have an important role in the
resistance to paclitaxel. Moreover, combination of paclitaxel
with oxamate shows synergistic inhibitory effect on taxolresistant cells (Table 1) by promoting cellular apoptosis.24
Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) is the master regulator of the
heat shock response in eukaryotes. HSF1 functions primarily
Figure 1 Dysregulated metabolism affects chemoresistance via multiple cellular pathways. Glycolytic intermediates generated by dysregulated cancer metabolism fuel
expanded cellular growth and contribute to clinical resistance. ATP generated by the glycolytic breakdown of glucose fuels the active export of chemotherapeutic agents by the
ABC transporters and induces HIF-1a expression. Export of the glycolytic end product, lactate and expression of carbonic anhydrases shift the pH ratio of the interior and
exterior of the cell resulting in decreased passive transport of basic drugs. Signaling pathways activated by dysregulated metabolism also contribute to resistance, either via
repressing pro-apoptotic signaling or activating compensatory pathways to circumvent drug-induced signal inhibition

to coordinate the response to heat shock, but recent studies
demonstrate HSF1 exhibiting non-heat shock functions
important for cancer development.67–69 Dai et al70 reported
that HSF1 increases glucose uptake, lactate production and
LDH activity. Our previous study showed that ErbB2 promotes
glycolysis partially through upregulation of HSF1 and LDHA
(Figure 1), whereas downregulation of HSF1 leads to
decreased glycolysis.49 Our recent studies showed that
trastuzumab-resistant cells have significantly higher HSF1
protein levels than trastuzumab-sensitive cells. Moreover, we
found that inhibition of HSF1 sensitizes cells to trastuzumab
and overexpression of HSF1 increased trastuzumab resistance, demonstrating that HSF1 can have an important role in
resistance to trastuzumab.23
We reported that increased glycolysis via HSF1 and LDHA
contributes to trastuzumab resistance. Importantly, we found
that combination of trastuzumab and oxamate synergistically
inhibits growth of both trastuzumab-sensitive and trastuzumab-resistant cancer both in vitro and in vivo (Table 1),
because of more efficient glycolysis inhibition.23 Overall, highrate glycolysis confers chemoresistance and HSF1 and LDHA
may potentially act as excellent targets for overcoming this
resistance in cancer patients.
Targeting PDK. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is responsible for the rate-limiting conversion of pyruvate to acetylCoA, which enters the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to
generate ATP. PDK phosphorylates PDH and inhibits its
enzymatic activity. Four isotypes of PDK (PDK1–4) have
been identified with PDK3 demonstrating the highest activity
coupled with a lack of inhibition in response to high
concentrations of pyruvate.71 Hypoxia induces PDK3 expression via upregulation of HIF-1a, which binds to the promoter of
PDK3, resulting in a switch from mitochondrial respiration to
glycolysis for energy production. Hypoxia-mediated PDK3
induction or forced PDK3 overexpression significantly inhibits
cell apoptosis and increases resistance to cisplatin or
paclitaxel (Figure 1). Knockdown of PDK3 inhibited hypoxiainduced glycolysis and increases susceptibility of cancer cells
to anticancer drugs such as cisplatin, paclitaxel or oxaliplatin
(Table 1).71,72 Moreover, PDK3 levels are elevated and
correlated with the HIF-1a level in patient colon cancer tissues
and strongly correlates with the severity of the cancer while
predicting poor disease-free survival outcomes.72 These
findings indicate that PDK3 contributes to hypoxia-induced
drug resistance and is potentially a novel target for improving
chemotherapy or overcoming drug resistance.
Dichloroacetate (DCA) inactivates PDK leading to reactivation of PDH and a metabolic switch from glycolysis to
mitochondrial respiration.55,73 The preclinical trials on DCA
have shown its effectiveness in a variety of tumors via
induction of apoptosis.74–78 However, its effect as a solitary
agent is limited in the ongoing clinical trials.79,80 Combinational therapy has displayed more effectiveness; cotreatment
with DCA and omeprazole exhibits synergistic antitumor
activity (Table 1).79 Cotreatment of DCA, omeprazole and
tamoxifen completely blocks the proliferation of fibrosarcoma
cells (Table 1), whereas the same combination does not affect
the proliferation of human normal fibroblast cells. Moreover,
these three drugs were prescribed to a cholangiocarcinoma
patient and successfully blocked the disease progression for 3
months.80 Owing to its low price, low toxicity, oral administration, long history of clinical use and ability to overcome cancer
cells apoptosis resistance DCA serves as a potential
metabolic-targeting molecule for sensitizing cancer cells to
chemotherapy or radiotherapy.76 DCA potentiates the anticancer effects of 5-FU (Table 1) via inducing more mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis.81 Sulindac, a FDA-approved nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, has anticancer activity. The
combination of DCA and sulindac enhances killing of lung and
squamous cell carcinoma cells (Table 1), but not normal cells.
The selective killing mechanism involves ROS production,
loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, JNK-mediated
signaling and apoptotic death.82 DCA can also increase the
sensitivity to radiotherapy.75 Cao et al75 reported that DCA
sensitizes both wild-type and Bcl-2-overexpressing cancer
cells to radiation (Table 1) by potentiating the apoptotic
machinery via interaction with Bcl-2. In summary, targeting
PDK can sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy, radiotherapy or overcome drug resistance.
Targeting FASN. The fatty acid biosynthesis pathway
catalyzes lipid synthesis from basic metabolites like acetyland malonyl-CoA. The FASN complex facilitates lipogenesis
by synthesizing palmitate from its base components. FASN
expression in normal adult tissues is generally very low or
undetectable, and it is significantly upregulated and correlates
with poor prognosis in many types of cancer. The metabolic
products of the FASN complex are rapidly consumed by
actively dividing cells and recent data demonstrates that
FASN expression is important for tumor growth and survival,
suggesting that FASN is a metabolic oncogene.83
FASN has an active role in ErbB2-induced breast cancer
chemoresistance to docetaxel,84 while trastuzumab-resistant
breast cancer cells gain high sensitivity to FASN inhibition
indicating that FASN is also important in ErbB2-induced
resistance in breast cancers.85 FASN is overexpressed and
its activity is increased in the multidrug-resistant breast cancer
cell line MCF7/AdVp3000.22 Increased palmitic acid production from ectopic FASN overexpression is also shown to
decrease adriamycin and mitoxantrone-induced apoptosis.22
In pancreatic cancer, there is also a positive correlation
between FASN expression and resistance to chemo- or
radiotherapy. FASN expression is significantly upregulated in
pancreatic cancer and inhibition of FASN by siRNA or the FAS
inhibitor orlistat reduces gemcitabine resistance, whereas
ectopic overexpression of FASN contributes to intrinsic
resistance to gemcitabine and radiation. FASN-induced
radiation resistance may result from decrease in radiationmediated ceramide production, leading to reduced caspase 8-
induced apoptosis. However, the mechanism of FASNinduced gemcitabine resistance remains to be elucidated.86
To date, several FASN inhibitors have shown antitumor
activity including cerulenin, C75, orlistat, C93, GSK 837149A
and natural plant-derived polyphenols. Both cerulenin and
C75 are early small-molecule FASN inhibitors. Cerulenin is a
natural compound isolating from Cephalosporium caerulens
and contains an epoxy group that reacts with FASN to inhibit
its activity. C75 is derived from cerulenin and interacts with
FASN to inhibit its activity.83 Both cerulenin and C75 induce

cancer cell apoptosis by similar mechanism including malonyl-CoA accumulation,87 p53 accumulation,88 induction of
ER stress89 and suppression of DNA replication.90 FASN
blockade by cerulenin synergistically enhances the efficacy of
docetaxel against ErbB2-overexpressing and docetaxelresistant SKBR3 cells (Table 1) in part via decreasing ErbB2
expression.84 Inhibition of FASN activity with cerulenin/C75 or
by siRNA upregulates the expression of PEA3, a transcriptional repressor of ErbB2, leading to downregulation of ErbB2
in ErbB2-overexpressing breast and ovarian cancer cells.84 A
combination of the FASN inhibitor cerulenin and trastuzumab
synergistically downregulates ErbB2 expression, leading to
more effective tumor growth inhibition (Table 1). Furthermore,
inhibition of FASN activity synergistically enhances trastuzumab-induced apoptosis in ErbB2-overexpressing breast
cancer cells.91 The model proposed by Menendez et al91
describes crosstalk between FASN and ErbB2 and suggests
that FASN has a role in regulation of proliferation and cell
survival by assisting in the maintenance of the cancerous
phenotype. FASN inhibition affects the phospholipid partitioning and the formation of lipid rafts, which may result in the
internalization and degradation of ErbB2 rather than successfully migration to the cell surface. This depletion of cell
surface-associated ErbB2 could enhance the antitumor
effects of trastuzumab (Table 1).92 In addition to enhancing
the efficacy of docetaxel and trastuzumab, cerulenin
increases 5-FU-induced growth inhibition (Table 1).93 Similarly, C75 and trastuzumab synergistically decrease ErbB2
expression and enhance apoptotic cell death (Table 1).85
Orlistat is a b-lactone compound and an irreversible
inhibitor of FASN. Orlistat induces cell cycle G1/S arrest by
downregulating Skp2, a component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase
that controls the turnover of p27Kip1, leading to activation of
the retinoblastoma protein pathway.94 Orlistat inhibits
endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis.95 In addition
to cytostatic effects, orlistat also has cytotoxic effects through
activation of caspase-8-mediated apoptosis because of
negative regulation of the mTOR pathway by upregulation of
DNA damage-inducible transcript 4.96 FASN inhibition with
orlistat increases sensitivity to adriamycin and mitoxantrone in
FASN-overexpressing breast cancer cells (Table 1) but not in
the normal mammary epithelial cell line.22 Orlistat treatment of
pancreatic cancer cells increases the response to gemcitabine (Table 1).86 In summary, FASN is a promising anticancer
target that may result in chemosensitization or enhanced
efficacy when FASN function is disrupted as part of a
combinatorial treatment regimen.
Targeting glutaminolysis. Glutamine has an important role
in cell growth and energy metabolism. Glutaminolysis,
consists of two steps: the first is catalyzed by glutaminase
(GLS) and converts glutamine to glutamate, whereas the
second is catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and
converts glutamate to a-ketoglutarate (a-KG).97 There are
two types of GLS in mammalian cells, kidney-type GLS
(GLS1) and liver-type GLS (GLS2).98 Metabolic flux experiments tracking 13C show that cancer cells exhibiting
Warburg-like metabolism do not stop utilizing the TCA cycle
– instead these cells come to rely on glutamine as the carbon
source for the TCA cycle.99 This allows the intermediates
generated by the TCA cycle to feed other biosynthetic
pathways as precursors.98 Therefore, cancer cells are
dependent on glutamine to maintain the TCA cycle.
Glutaminolysis co-induced by glutamine and leucine activates mTORC1 signaling, which triggers cell growth and
inhibits autophagy.97 The mTOR pathway is involved in
cisplatin resistance in highly malignant AFP-producing
gastric cancer (AFPGC).100 This indicates that elevated
glutaminolysis is linked to drug resistance.
Bis-2-[5-phenylacetamido-1,2,4-thiadiazol-2-yl] ethyl sulfide
(BPTES), an inhibitor of GLS, caused decreased aerobic cell
proliferation and hypoxic cell death.101 Inhibition of GLS by
siRNA or BPTES slows the growth of glioblastoma cells with an
isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutation. BPTES treatment
inhibits GLS activity, lowers glutamate and a-KG levels and
increases glycolytic intermediates, suggesting that simultaneous inhibition of GLS and glycolysis may be a more efficient
strategy to treat mutant IDH1 patients.102 An inhibitor of Rho
GTPase-dependent cellular transformation, named 968, was
found to block the growth of human breast cancer and B
lymphoma cells without affecting normal cells. 968 Targets GLS
C, a specific carboxy-terminal splice variant form of GLS1.
Elevated levels of basal GLS activity has been shown to be
dependent on Rho GTPases and NF-kB activity in transformed
fibroblasts and breast cancer cells, which is blocked by 968.25
This demonstrates that oncogenic transformation can be
inhibited by targeting GLS activity, a potential therapeutic
strategy against human malignancies.11,16,25
Rapamycin, a mTORC1 inhibitor, enhances the antitumor
effect of cisplatin in AFPGC both in intro and in vivo.
100
Inhibition of mTORC1 by NVP-BEZ235, a dual PI3K/mTOR
inhibitor, synergizes with chemotherapeutic agents such as
cyclophosphamide, cytarabine and dexamethasone in T-cell
ALL cell lines. Moreover, NVP-BEZ235 can sensitize vincristine-resistant Jurkat cells, indicating that inhibition of
mTORC1 activity may revert chemoresistance.103 Glutaminolysis activates mTORC1 signaling and inhibition of glutaminolysis via GLS inhibitors (DON and BPTES) or siRNAtargeting GLS or GDH, prevents mTORC1 activation.97 It is
reasonable to predict that targeting glutaminolysis or GLS
may sensitize cancer cells to common chemotherapeutic
agents by reducing mTORC1 activity.
Conclusions
Cancer cells reprogram their metabolism in order to satisfy
their bioenergetic and biosynthetic requirements. Increased
aerobic glycolysis, fatty acid synthesis and glutamine metabolism has been linked to therapeutic resistance in cancer.
We speculate that deregulated cancer metabolism promotes
cell proliferation because of increased energy production and
metabolite synthesis, which decreases drug-induced apoptosis, conferring therapeutic resistance. Molecular mechanisms
of drug resistance are complex and include increased drug
efflux, drug inactivation, enhanced DNA damage repair and
activation of pro-survival signaling (Figure 1). Increased
glycolysis produces higher ATP and NADPH levels. Chemotherapeutic drugs display antitumor effects in part by
inducing oxidative damage. NADPH is a critical antioxidant
and high levels maintained through increased glycolysis in

cancer cells may contribute to chemoresistance. ATP exerts
two effects on drug resistance: elevated ATP levels can
activate ABC transporters leading to increased drug efflux and
upregulate HIF-1a signaling inducing hypoxia-associated
drug resistance. Both increased drug efflux and upregulation
of HIF-1a signaling result in therapeutic resistance.
HIF-1a-mediated resistance occurs through a variety of
mechanisms. Upregulation of the enzymes necessary for
glycolysis facilitates a metabolic shift that enhances nonmitochondrial mechanisms of ATP production.104 Reduced
reliance on mitochondria results in less reactive oxygen
species, which prevents the DNA damage that would
activate both DNA repair and stress response pathways,
steps that help set the stage for the induction of apoptotic
pathways.105,106
The increase in glycolytic metabolism also results in the
production of lactate, whose export results in the acidification
of the extracellular environment. The resulting extracellular
acidification coupled with HIF-1a-induced expression of
carbonic anhydrases causes a significant change in the pH
ratio between the intracellular and extracellular environments.107–109 This pH shift decreases the passive absorption
of many drugs that would otherwise accumulate at a greater
concentration within the cell. Active drug efflux is also fueled
by glycolytic ATP production and HIF-1a-induced transporter
overexpression resulting in a significant decrease in the
cytoplasmic retention of many anticancer agents.110,111
HIF-1a overexpression also induces cellular compensations that can bypass the mechanisms on which common
drugs rely. Inhibitors of EGFR family signaling may demonstrate reduced effect under high HIF-1a expression because
of an upregulation of c-MET, which allows alternative
signaling networks to produce similar phenotypic effects in
the presence of reduced EGFR family signaling.112,113 In
addition, HIF-1a induces a shift in b-tubulin isoform expression, undermining the effect of microtubule destabilizing
agents.114,115 Downregulation of other drug targets, such as
topoisomerase II or estrogen receptor a (ERa), can occur
when HIF-1a expression is high and reduces the effect of
drugs such as tamoxifen and etoposide.116–118
Finally, HIF-1a induces expression of genes that promote
survival through anti-apoptotic signaling (survivin, Bcl-XL,
Mcl-1) or other survival mechanisms such as autophagy
(BNIP3, BNIP3L).119–123 HIF-1a expression also decreases
pro-apoptotic signaling by inducing the expression of decoy
receptors (such as DcR2) that compete for pro-apoptotic
signaling factors like tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosisinducing ligand, thereby decreasing productive signaling
through apoptosis inducing receptors including DR4 and
DR5.124,125 Attenuation of pro-apoptotic signaling allows cells
to tolerate a higher level of chemotherapeutic insult before
inducing cellular death pathways. HIF-1a signaling works with
glycolytic metabolism to trigger a variety of anti-drug
mechanisms that generate in vitro and clinical resistance
(Figure 1). We have provided examples of how disrupting the
cancer metabolism can short circuit the feedback loops that
provide protection from anticancer agents.
Targeting key metabolic enzymes enhances therapeutic
efficacy or combats drug resistance by promoting druginduced apoptosis of cancer cells. ATP depletion by glycolytic
inhibitors promotes intracellular drug accumulation, leading to
increased drug sensitization. However, the molecular
mechanisms by which targeting metabolism could impair
chemoresistance is not fully understood and deserves further
investigation. Combining chemotherapeutic agents with targeted disruption of dysregulated cellular metabolism represents a promising strategy to overcome drug resistance and
improve the efficacy of current chemotherapeutic agents in
cancer patients. Although therapeutic resistance can arise by
multiple mechanisms, the examples listed above demonstrate
that targeting a common feature across multiple types of
cancer – dysregulated metabolism – can result in reduction of
chemoresistance in a wide array of cancer types. Further
investigation into the workings of cancer metabolism and
resistance will help us to design more selective metabolic
inhibitors allowing for a wide array of options and a more
individually tailored response to chemoresistance.
