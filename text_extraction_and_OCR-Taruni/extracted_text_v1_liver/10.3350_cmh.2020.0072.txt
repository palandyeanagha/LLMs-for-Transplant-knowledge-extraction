INTRODUCTION
Before the introduction of the brain death law, transplant organs were taken from non-heart beating donors, now commonly 
referred to as donation after circulatory death (DCD) donors. Due 
to better outcomes, however, the majority of liver transplantations 
have been performed using donation after brain death (DBD) donors. With an increasing demand for donor organs, a living donor 
option was added to mitigate waitlist mortality. To further expand 
the donor pool, transplant centers were forced to accept donors 
with increased risks. In the 1990s, DCD donors started regaining 
attention as a valuable source of liver grafts. Despite growing experiences of DCD in liver transplantation, increased risks of graft 
failure and ischemic biliary complications remain critical concerns.
The definition of DCD is organ donation from patients who have 
suffered a catastrophic brain injury but do not meet the criteria 
for brain death.1
 In 1995, an international workshop to examine 
issues surrounding non-heart beating donors was held in Maastricht, Netherlands. The workshop resulted in the classification of 
DCD donors into four categories: category I (dead on arrival), catLiver graft from donation after circulatory death donor:

Donation after circulatory death (DCD) is an increasing source of liver grafts for transplantation, yet outcomes have been 
inferior compared to donation after brain death liver transplantation. These worse outcomes are mainly due to the severe 
graft injury resulting from mandatory warm ischemia during DCD organ recovery. New evidence, however, indicates that 
improved donor selection and surgical techniques can decrease the risk of graft failure and ischemic cholangiopathy (IC). 
Under current best practices, DCD organs are retrieved with the super-rapid technique, optimizing timing and protecting 
the liver graft from detrimental warm ischemia. Graft viability is influenced by both the quantity and quality of warm 
ischemia, which is unique to each donor and causes various degrees of pathophysiologic consequences. Evidence 
also shows that the choice of preservation solution and premortem heparin administration influences graft viability. 
Additionally, although the precise mechanism of IC remains unknown, stasis of blood during donor warm ischemia 
may cause the formation of microthrombi in the peribiliary vascular plexus and ischemia of the bile duct. Importantly, 
thrombolytic protocols show a possible preventive modality for IC. Finally, while ex vivo machine perfusion technology 
has gained an interest in DCD liver transplantation, further studies are necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of this 
evolving field to improve graft quality and transplant outcomes. (Clin Mol Hepatol 2020;26:401-410)

egory II (unsuccessful resuscitation), category III (awaiting cardiac 
arrest), and category IV (cardiac arrest in brain dead donor).2
 Currently, the majority of DCD liver grafts are recovered from category III donors under a controlled environment (controlled DCD). 
While uncontrolled DCD donors (category II) have been used in 
some European countries with acceptable outcomes, many transplant centers are reluctant to use them due to unknown warm 
ischemic time.3
Organs recovered from DCD donors inevitably experience warm 
ischemic injury, which is the primary element distinguishing DCD 
from DBD (Fig. 1).1
 A progressive drop in blood pressure and oxygen saturation during an extended withdrawal period is detrimental to graft viability. Since the liver graft is vulnerable to warm 
ischemic injury, DCD liver transplantation is associated with an increased risk of graft failure and surgical complications.4,5 Nonetheless, with the need for liver transplantation is increasing worldwide, DCD donors will continue to be an essential source of 
lifesaving liver grafts. For the best use of DCD donors, it is crucial 
to understand the mechanisms of tissue injury of DCD liver grafts 
and how to maintain graft viability (Table 1). This article reviews 
the current practice of DCD organ recovery as well as DCD donor 
selection, which is essential to achieve successful outcomes in 
DCD liver transplantation. Further, critical advancement in this 
field will be discussed regarding preventive modalities for ischemic biliary complications and graft failure.
Figure 1. Timeline of DCD organ recovery. The definition of the agonal phase varies based on each program’s policy regarding its cutoffs of MAP and 
SpO2. Generally, the agonal phase begins when blood pressure or SpO2 drops to certain levels (70–80 mmHg in systolic pressure, 50–60 mmHg in 
MAP, or 60–80% in SpO2). The standoff (no touch) time lasts at least 2 minutes, but not more than 5 minutes, to confirm the irreversibility of circulatory 
death. Time from incision to cross-clamp (*) is the only period that is surgically modifiable to shorten donor warm ischemia. DCD, donation after circulatory death; MAP, mean arterial pressure; SpO2, peripheral oxygen saturation.

DCD DONOR SELECTION
Donor age is one of the most potent indicators of graft survival 
in DCD liver transplantation. According to the Scientific Registry 
of Transplant Recipients data from September 2001 to April 2009 
(n=1,576), donor age of 50–60 years increased the risk of graft 
failure by 39% when compared to younger donors. Moreover, the 
risk jumped to 88% for donors older than 60 years.6
 Similarly, 
based on UK national data on risk factors for graft failure 
(n=1,153) from January 2000 to December 2015, donor age has 
been included as an essential element of the DCD donor risk 
score.7
On the other hand, conflicting results have been reported by 
single-center studies from high volume programs. For instance, a 
retrospective study by Mayo Clinic showed that recipients who received liver grafts from DCD donors ≥50 years of age achieved 
comparable graft survival to those who received liver grafts from 
younger DCD donors.8
 Our experience at Cleveland Clinic also 
demonstrated no significant impact of donor age on graft survival 
with an age cutoff of 45 years.9
 However, it should be noted that 
such favorable outcomes could have partly been achieved due to 
stringent donor and recipient selection criteria. Since the use of 
DCD donors per se is an independent risk factor, the coexistence 
of multiple risk factors should be avoided, such as high donor 
body mass index (BMI), graft steatosis, and high Model for EndStage Liver Disease (MELD) score in recipients. In the Birmingham 
group’s single-center study, an age cutoff of 60 years failed to 
distinguish recipients with poorer graft and patient survival.10
However, when donor age was combined with donor BMI 
≥25 kg/m2
, graft survival was significantly compromised.10 Since 
high donor BMI is often associated with macrosteatosis in the liver graft, a graft biopsy may be necessary during organ recovery to 
further evaluate the degree of steatosis. Further, cold ischemia 
has a significant impact on outcomes in DCD liver transplantation.6,11 Indeed, each hour in cold ischemia time increases the risk 
of graft failure by 6%.6
 Accordingly, when accepting aged DCD 
livers, careful risk assessment is essential to avoid not only donorand recipient-related risks, but also long warm and cold ischemic 
time. It should also be noted that the use of younger DCD donors 
does not guarantee a promising outcome, particularly when other 
unfavorable factors exist.9
DCD ORGAN RECOVERY
End of life care and withdrawal of life support
After an imminent death is identified, the Organ Procurement 
Organization (OPO) is notified to initiate an evaluation process to 
determine whether a patient is suitable to be an organ donor. If 
the patient does not fulfill the criteria of brain death despite a 
catastrophic brain injury, a discussion takes place with the family 
as to whether they wish to proceed with the withdrawal of life 
support. If the family agrees to proceed, a matched recipient(s) is 
identified, and an organ recovery team(s) arrives at the donor 
hospital. Withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy, which includes 
termination of cardiopulmonary support and all essential medications, often occurs in the operating room or intensive care unit in 
the presence of the family, depending on the OPO or hospital policy. The family needs to have as much time as needed to say 
goodbye to their loved one. Generally, the operating room is a 
preferred location to withdraw life support because the time for 
transport can be shortened to minimize warm ischemia. Indeed, 
not only is graft and patient survival better, but the incidence of 
complications is mitigated when life support is withdrawn in the 
operating room.12 With all comfort care measures in place, the 
donor is extubated, and life-sustaining treatments are terminated. 
For the pronouncement of death in DCD organ recovery, the hospital staff must use objective and auditable criteria that are standardized by the law. If the patient does not expire within the time 
that makes organ donation possible, the process of organ recovery is aborted, and the patient is transferred back to intensive 
care unit. The donor surgical team needs to wait for at least two 
minutes, and not more than five minutes, of “standoff time” before starting organ recovery, depending on local policy after donor death is declared (Fig. 1).1
 This standoff time is vital to confirm 
the irreversibility of circulatory death. It should be noted that operating room personnel who will be involved in organ recovery or 
transplantation must not be present when withdrawal of life support takes place. 
Organ recovery by super-rapid technique
After the required standoff time, the surgical team begins organ 
recovery with a midline incision from the suprasternal notch to the 
symphysis pubis.13 After placing a Balfour retractor, an assistant 
holds the small intestine upward to expose the sacral promontory. 
At approximately 5 cm superior to the sacral promontory, which 

404 https://doi.org/10.3350/cmh.2020.0072 http://www.e-cmh.org
Volume_26 Number_4 October 2020
may vary based on age, gender, and race, the bifurcation of the 
aorta can be identified in the retroperitoneum.14 It is crucial to 
stay at the midline to avoid inadvertent injury of the ureters. The 
distal aorta is incised to insert a cannula to commence cold perfusion (Fig. 2). Then, the inferior vena cava next to the aorta is incised to vent blood. A pool suction tip is inserted into the vena 
cava to assist venting. Next, the sternum is split, and the thoracic 
aorta is cross-clamped. Finally, the pericardium is opened, and 
the inferior vena cava is incised below the right atrium to decompress the transplant organs further. The abdominal cavity is then 
filled with ice slush. If a thoracic team is present, the supraceliac 
aorta, instead of the thoracic aorta, is cross-clamped between the 
esophagus and the caudate lobe of the liver. When the lesser sac 
is opened to gain access to the aorta, special attention should be 
paid to avoid inadvertent injury to the left accessory hepatic artery. While the inferior mesenteric vein can be cannulated to perfuse the portal system, there is no evidence that this improves 
graft quality in DCD. Once core cooling is achieved, the liver is recovered using the same technique for DBD organ recovery. With 
an experienced surgical team, the process from skin incision to 
cross-clamp can be done within a few minutes.
Premortem heparin administration
Systemic administration of heparin is universally adopted in DBD 
organ recovery to prevent thrombus formation in transplanted organs. In DCD donors, however, premortem heparin administration 
(30,000 units) is ethically controversial because systemic heparinization may hasten the death of donors due to theoretical concerns of intracranial hemorrhage or worsening of bleeding.15 According to the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients data, 
premortem heparin is currently used in >90% of DCD donors as a 
critical component of the DCD protocol.16 When premortem heparin is prohibited due to a local policy, heparin can be mixed in an 
initial bag of the cold preservation solution. Without premortem 
heparin, the risks of graft failure and primary non-function increase by 18% and 81%, respectively.16 Premortem heparin does 
not improve the discard rate of DCD livers.16
Preservation solution
The selection of preservation solutions may be critical to maintaining the viability of DCD livers. Conflicting data exists regarding the comparison between University of Wisconsin solution versus histidine‐tryptophan‐ketoglutarate (HTK) solution in DCD liver 
transplantation.17-19 Early studies failed to demonstrate significant 
differences in graft survival when comparing these solutions, possibly due to the small sample size. According to data from the 
United Network for Organ Sharing database from July 2004 to 
February 2008, however, the use of HTK solution was associated 
with an increased risk of graft failure by 44% in DCD grafts compared to University of Wisconsin solution (P=0.025), especially 
when cold ischemia time was >8 hours.20 Despite the data, some 
transplant centers prefer HTK solution due to lower viscosity, 
which might be beneficial to prevent biliary complications.17
QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF DONOR WARM 
ISCHEMIA TIME
In early experience, Feng et al.21 reported that the use of DCD 
donors was one of the most substantial risk factors for liver graft 
failure. Compared to DBD, the inferiority of DCD mainly stems 
from a poorer quality of liver grafts. Donor warm ischemia time 
(dWIT) is generally defined as the time from extubation to crossclamp (Fig. 1), the length of which has been considered a potent 
indicator of poor outcomes.22-24 Since early experience has demFigure 2. DCD organ recovery with the super-rapid technique. Aortic

onstrated that prolonged dWIT is associated with a lower graft 
survival and an increased risk of biliary complications, many transplant centers have adopted 30 minutes of dWIT as a cutoff to accept DCD livers. Indeed, the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients data demonstrated that the risk of graft loss increased by 
84% when dWIT was ≥35 minutes.6
 However, many studies have 
shown an equivocal association between dWIT and transplant 
outcomes.25-28 Such conflicting findings are mainly attributable to 
the heterogeneity of dWIT. Namely, from the withdrawal of life 
support to circulatory death, a wide range of hemodynamic perturbations is seen among donors. Changes in tissue perfusion and 
oxygenation during the agonal phase are not equal in each donor. 
Therefore, the trajectory of donor hemodynamics should be considered as an essential parameter to assess DCD liver graft quality. 
During DCD organ recovery, the donor surgical team receives a 
minute-by-minute update of donor hemodynamics, including 
blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and heart rate. Peripheral arterial pressure and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) are closely 
related to graft quality, and are particularly important. It is essential to understand that the time from withdrawal of life support to 
asystole consists of the pre-agonal and agonal phases (Fig. 1). 
Generally, the agonal phase begins when blood pressure or SpO2
drops to certain levels (70–80 mmHg in systolic pressure, 50–60 
mmHg in mean arterial pressure [MAP], or 60–80% in SpO2) in 
DCD organ recovery. During the agonal phase, donors become 
progressively hypotensive and hypoxic. However, no donor has an 
identical change of these hemodynamic parameters to others, and 
the exact timing of the onset of liver graft injury is unknown (Fig. 3).
Based on the clinical data of 87 DCD donors at Cleveland Clinic, 
trajectories of MAP were categorized into three clinically meaningful phenotypes (Fig. 4).28 The patient group who had the worst 
graft survival (1-year graft survival, 68.9%) was the group of patients who received liver grafts from Cluster 1 donors. With minimal or short pre-agonal phase, MAP declined gradually to asystole with a prolonged agonal phase (≥15 minutes, slow decliner) 
(Figs. 4, 5). The median dWIT of Cluster 1 was 27 minutes (interquartile range [IQR], 24–30 minutes). While dWIT was comparable (median, 29 minutes; IQR, 25–32 minutes), Cluster 2 donors 
maintained stable MAP during the pre-agonal phase over 10 minutes, which was followed by a rapid decline with a short agonal 
phase (<15 minutes) (Fig. 4). Finally, Cluster 3 donors had the 
shortest dWIT (median, 19 minutes; IQR, 16–22 minutes; P<0.001 
vs. Cluster 1 and 2) with a rapid decline of MAP from withdrawal 
to asystole (agonal phase <15 minutes). Interestingly and despite 
the longer dWIT, recipients who received Cluster 2 liver grafts had 
comparable graft survival to recipients with Cluster 3 donors (1-
year graft survival, 90.9% in Cluster 2 and 91.3% in Cluster 3). 
This favorable outcome in Cluster 2 is probably due to the pre-agonal phase of dWIT, which appears to help maintain adequate 
perfusion and oxygenation of the liver graft. With a similar phenotype in the agonal phase, Cluster 2 and 3 donors can be categorized as the rapid decliner, who has better graft survival than 
the slow decliner (Figs. 4, 5). The difference between these phenotypes indicates that both the quantity (length) and quality of 
dWIT play a crucial role in determining graft survival. Similar findings were seen with SpO2 trajectories.28
Taner et al.29 reported that time from asystole to cross-clamp 
was important to determine the viability of DCD liver grafts. This

asystole-cross clamp time consists of two critical periods, including the first portion as standoff time (2–5 minutes) to confirm the 
irreversibility of circulatory death, and the second portion which is 
the surgical time from incision to cross-clamp (Fig. 1). Both periods are critical because the liver graft receives no perfusion or oxygenation in the donor body due to stasis of blood. To shorten 
this asystole-cross clamp period, mandatory standoff time can be 
minimized to 2 minutes as recommended by the American Society 
of Transplant Surgeons.1
 However, it is also imperative to maintain 
public confidence in the irreversibility of death determination. 
Since the second portion is the only time that is surgically modifiable, it is essential for the surgical team to commence cold perfusion and cross-clamp as quickly as possible (Fig. 1).
ISCHEMIC CHOLANGIOPATHY (IC)
Increased risk of biliary complications is the Achilles’ heel of 
DCD liver transplantation. IC causes diffuse or focal intrahepatic 
biliary stricture, liver abscess, and necrosis, resulting in graft failure and retransplantation. The incidence of IC in DCD liver transplantation has been reported to be as high as 30–50%, and is 
one of the reasons transplant centers hesitate to accept DCD donors.17,22,25,30,31 Patients who develop IC have significantly inferior 
graft survival compared to those who do not, because there is no 
effective therapeutic modality to salvage liver grafts from IC.5
Therefore, it is vital to prevent the development of IC.
The precise mechanism for the development of IC remains unFigure 5. Graft survival of the slow decliner (Cluster 1) and rapid decliner (Cluster 2 and 3) with respect to (A) MAP (P=0.038) and (B) SpO2 (P=0.039).

known. Interestingly, clinical and radiological presentations of IC 
are similar to those of hepatic artery thrombosis. The peribiliary 
vascular plexus of the human liver receives blood supply only via 
the hepatic artery.32,33 Therefore, a similar ischemic etiology may 
play a role in the development of IC. If microthrombi are formed 
in the peribiliary vascular plexus due to stasis of blood during 
warm ischemia, microcirculation of the intrahepatic bile duct can 
be disturbed. If this is the case, the formation of microthrombi 
causes ischemic biliary necrosis (Fig. 6).33
Study results offer conflicting evidence regarding microthrombi 
formation in DCD livers. An animal model demonstrated an experimental evidence of microthrombi formation in the peribiliary 
vascular plexus.34 A human study also demonstrated that peribiliary vascular injury with microthrombi is more prominent in DCD 
compared with DBD liver grafts, which correlates with the incidence of IC.35 On the other hand, Verhoeven et al.36 reported no 
evidence of increased microthrombi formation in human DCD liver 
grafts.
An early study from the Pittsburgh group demonstrated the 
usefulness of thrombolytic therapy with surgical revascularization 
to rescue liver grafts from hepatic artery thrombosis.37 When such 
urgent intervention is conducted before irreversible tissue damage 
occurs, thrombolytic therapy can help prevent biliary necrosis.38
According to these clinical findings, the use of thrombolytic 
agents may be of benefit to prevent the development of IC. 
In August 2005, Cleveland Clinic implemented a new DCD protocol to use tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) to prevent IC. The 
protocol was used in 68 patients until December 2013; 22 patients in an initial pilot study33 and 46 patients in a following prospective study.39 Assuming the formation of microthrombi is the 
mechanism of IC, tPA (Activase®
 1 mg/mL, 0.5 mg per 100 g liver 
weight; Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA) was injected into the donor hepatic artery on the back table. After portal reperfusion, the hepatic artery was kept clamped for 10–15 
minutes. To minimize the systemic introduction of tPA, the hepatic 
artery was unclamped before arterial anastomosis to allow excess 
tPA to back-bleed and discard the effluent. In the initial pilot 
study, the protocol dose of tPA was used in 12 grafts. Reduced 
doses (0.2–0.4 mg per 100 g liver weight) were used in 10 grafts 
based on the presence of various risk factors for bleeding such as 
donor age, dWIT, cold ischemia time, MELD score, and previous 
history of major laparotomy in recipients. Among the 22 patients 
in the pilot study, only two recipients (9%) developed IC, including one with diffuse necrosis requiring retransplantation and another with focal stricture of the intrahepatic bile duct with a functioning graft.33 However, the randomized prospective study failed 
to demonstrate a preventive effect of tPA for IC (7% [3/46] with 
tPA vs. 3% [1/33] without tPA, P=0.6). Although there was a 
trend toward lower incidence of early allograft dysfunction with 
tPA (17% vs. 34%, P=0.07), there was no difference in the incidence of primary non-function, hepatic artery thrombosis, and retransplantation.39 Since 2014, Cleveland Clinic abandoned the 
thrombolytic protocol based on the results of the prospective 
study, as well as the low incidence of IC even without the tPA 
treatment. 
University of Toronto and Ochsner Clinic also adopted a new 
thrombolytic protocol.40,41 With the Ochsner Clinic protocol, 2 mg 
of tPA was injected after 5 mg of verapamil into the donor hepatic

artery after portal vein anastomosis. The University of Toronto 
protocol injected tPA (100 μg/kg donor body weight) into the donor hepatic artery before portal vein anastomosis. While 21.2% of 
patients at Ochsner Clinic and the University of Toronto experienced IC without tPA (n=33), IC occurred in less than 3.5% of patients with the tPA protocols (n=56 at Ochsner Clinic, n=29 at 
University of Toronto; P<0.005).40 A subsequent study by Ochsner 
Clinic with 100 DCD liver transplantations demonstrated that the 
tPA protocol achieved comparable graft and patient survival compared with DBD liver transplantation, with an IC incidence of only 
3%.41 Indiana University developed a different thrombolytic protocol along with a systematic approach, including shorter donor 
and recipient ischemia time, as well as shorter operation time.42 In 
their protocol, 100 mg of tPA was mixed with 1 L of room temperature normal saline, which was administered via the donor 
aorta as an initial flush solution in organ recovery. This protocol 
achieved a zero incidence of IC in 30 patients who received DCD 
liver grafts.
Due to the risk of excessive bleeding, transplant centers are 
generally reluctant to adopt the use of thrombolytic agents. Yet 
results from the Centers that used these existing thrombolytic 
protocols do not support this concern.33,40-42 Still, since coagulopathy, fibrinolysis, and thrombocytopenia are not uncommon in DCD 
liver transplantation, the risk of bleeding should not be underestimated even with the small dose of thrombolytic agents.33
EX VIVO MACHINE PERFUSION
Ex vivo machine perfusion technology has recently gained the 
increased interest in DCD liver transplantation. Several single-center studies in the hypothermic setting have demonstrated less 
graft tissue damage, better graft survival, and lower incidence of 
IC, compared with static cold preservation.43-45 On the other hand, 
normothermic machine perfusion, which creates more physiologic 
conditions to preserve, assess, and potentially repair liver grafts, 
is expected to improve outcomes for DCD liver transplantation 
even further. To date, however, clinical data are not available to 
support normothermic machine perfusion as a preventive and 
therapeutic modality.46-48 While a randomized clinical trial of normothermic machine perfusion achieved a 50% reduction of graft 
injury, the study demonstrated no significant difference in survival 
or IC rates compared to static cold preservation.49 It should be 
noted, however, that normothermic machine perfusion helped decrease the organ discard rate, providing an opportunity to increase the donor pool.49 Future studies are necessary to further 
explore the potential of this evolving technology in terms of graft 
viability and ex vivo organ repair.
CONCLUSION
In real practice, the DCD liver graft increases access to lifesaving organs for patients awaiting liver transplantation. While the 
increased risks of graft failure and IC are of concern, outcomes 
after DCD liver transplantation have improved over the last two 
decades with a better understanding of donor selection and organ recovery techniques. It is vital to understand the importance 
of not only the quantity but also the quality of donor warm ischemia to determine DCD graft viability because each donor has 
different nature of warm ischemia, which induces various degrees 
of pathophysiologic consequences. Potential interventions, using 
thrombolytic agents and ex vivo machine perfusion technology, 
are evolving with encouraging reports from major transplant centers. Continued research is necessary to optimize existing protocols as well as develop new therapeutic approaches.
