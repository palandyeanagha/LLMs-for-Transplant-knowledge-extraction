Objectives: Impairment of cardiac function and arrhythmias often coexist in patients with liver diseases. Many studies have proved this 
coexistence and put forward various theories toward its pathophysiology. This narrative review tries to find the answers with supporting 
evidence on five main questions:
• Do high serum bilirubin levels have a strong association with cardiac arrhythmias?
• Can corrected QT interval (QTc) be relied upon for predicting a risk factor toward imminent arrhythmias?
• Is there an association between QTc prolongation and mortality?
• Are high serum bilirubin and cardiac dysfunction closely associated?
• What is the probable pathophysiology behind this association?
Materials and methods: Clinical evidence was obtained by using search engines, namely, Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Google Scholar. 
Studies published in journals in the English language, between January 1969 and December 2019, which mentioned the relationship between 
cardiac arrhythmia and liver disease, were included. We used the keywords: jaundice, bilirubin, arrhythmia, ECG, QTc interval, QT dispersion, 
liver, and cirrhosis. Relevant animal or human studies answering the five main questions were extracted and reviewed.
Conclusion: The evidence included in our review sheds light on the fact that approximately 50% of liver cirrhosis cases develop cirrhotic 
cardiomyopathy (CC) and there has been an association between liver abnormalities and cardiac pathology. The present review also supports 
that there exists a strong association between high levels of serum bilirubin levels and cardiac arrhythmias, QTc value can be relied upon as 
a risk factor for predicting imminent arrhythmias, and that it is associated with mortality. Its basic pathophysiology can be explained by the 
potential action of bile acids in prolonging the QT interval. It also causes cardiac hypertrophy and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes leading to 
cardiac dysfunction.

In t r o d u c tio n
Liver disease rates are steadily increasing over the years. According 
to National statistics in the UK, liver diseases have been ranked as the 
fifth most common cause of death. Liver diseases are recognized as 
the second leading cause of mortality among all digestive diseases 
in the US.1,2 The global prevalence of cirrhosis falls in the range 
between 4.5 and 9.5% of the general population. It was estimated 
that more than 50 million people in the world suffer from chronic 
liver disease.3,4 Deaths from cirrhosis are constantly increasing and 
it would make it the 12th leading cause of death in 2020.5
Cardiac arrhythmias are frequently seen in patients with 
jaundice, especially in cases with “acute decompensation of chronic 
liver disease”, frequently admitted to intensive care units. Mostly 
these are new-onset arrhythmias, and they pose a real challenge to 
the intensivists in understanding their pathophysiology and hence 
managing them. They are often resistant to treatment and tend to 
recur. It has been estimated that these arrhythmias are associated 
with 200% higher mortality, longer hospital stay, and therefore 
higher expenditure on medical management. It is also associated 
with higher rates of shock, respiratory, and kidney failures. Due to 
this reason, it is suggested that a robust system needs to be evolved 
toward screening and follow-ups of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) 
patients for dysrhythmias.6,7
In this narrative review, we aim to find and agree upon a 
reliable parameter that can predict impending cardiac arrhythmias

which if found can be acted upon promptly and hence would 
prevent a significant amount of morbidity and mortality. We have 
summarized evidence that supports the relationship between high 
serum bilirubin levels and cardiac arrhythmias. A detailed literature 
search was also done to explain the pathophysiology behind this 
phenomenon. Therefore, the objective is set to find answers with 
supporting evidence on five main questions:
• Do high serum bilirubin levels have a strong association with 
cardiac arrhythmias?
• Can corrected QT interval (QTc) be relied upon for predicting a 
risk factor toward imminent arrhythmias?
• Is there an association between QTc prolongation and mortality?
• Are high serum bilirubin and cardiac dysfunction, closely 
associated?
• What is the probable pathophysiology behind this association?

Data Sources and Search Strategy
We used the Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, and PubMed to 
search for the eligible studies. English language studies which were 
published in journals during the years 1969–2019, addressing the 
relationship between cardiac arrhythmia and liver dysfunction. 
We used the keywords: jaundice, bilirubin, arrhythmia, ECG, 
QTc interval, QT dispersion, liver, and cirrhosis. Letters to editor, 
conference papers, book reviews, book chapters, newspaper, expert 
opinions, and theses or dissertations were not used. We excluded 
the articles that were not published in the English language. 
Relevant studies answering the five main questions were extracted.
Titles were screened first, then abstracts, based on inclusion 
and exclusion criteria. Questionable eligibility based on title and 
abstract was read in full and judged for eligibility. Duplicates were 
eliminated and irrelevant articles were excluded from the review. 
The references of all articles, selected for full-text evaluation, were 
reviewed for the potentially eligible studies.
Dis c u s sio n
The functioning of the liver and the heart interact mutually. Often 
liver induced cardiac disease goes underdiagnosed due to its 
complex pathophysiology. The present review was conducted 
to find evidence regarding this interaction with the help of 
five questions. The very first question raised in our review is 
whether cardiac arrhythmias have a strong association with 
serum bilirubin levels or not. We found that there is a significant 
coexistence between the functioning of the liver and heart, a liver 
disease affecting the heart, and vice versa.
8
 The heart is the most 
affected organ in the patient with liver cirrhosis and the frequent 
cardiac symptoms experienced with liver failure are palpitations, 
dyspnea, angina chest discomfort, electrocardiographic changes, 
tachycardia, and bradycardia.9
The risk of arrhythmia is influenced by factors, such as, cirrhotic 
cardiomyopathy (CC), cardiac-ion-channel remodeling, impaired 
autonomic functions, impaired electrolyte balance, hepatorenal 
syndrome, and impaired drug metabolism, which advocates 
closed monitoring of cirrhotic patients.10 In the mid-70s, a study 
demonstrated a high incidence of cardiac arrhythmias in patients 
with fulminant hepatic failure. A high number of these patients 
suffered from heart block and developed bradycardia. A quarter of 
these patients had sudden cardiac death. More than a quarter of the 
total number of patients enrolled showed T wave and ST-segment 
changes, out of which, only 10% of patients who had arrhythmias 
survived. Almost 50% of the patients who died of arrhythmias 
did not show any macroscopic changes in the heart on autopsy. 
Therefore, this study strongly advocated close cardiac monitoring 
in acute hepatic failure cases.11
Nakasone et al.12 and Yamamoto and Friedman13 in their case 
report found that Torsade de Pointes, a rare, life-threatening 
arrhythmia, is associated with alcoholic liver cirrhosis and CC, 
respectively. Even peripheral autonomic neuropathy which is often 
seen in cirrhotic patients can cause arrhythmias.14
Yet, another study done in the late 70s found that 35% of 
patients with alcoholic liver disease showed PR prolongation and 
intraventricular conduction defect was seen in 50%.15 A study done 
in recent years showed a high incidence and prevalence of atrial 
fibrillation in patients with liver disease. It also showed that the 
magnitude of liver disease, as estimated by model end-stage liver 
disease (MELD), is a good predictor for new-onset atrial fibrillation.16
The second question was to find out whether QTc can be relied 
upon as a risk factor or for predicting imminent arrhythmias. A few 
studies have demonstrated that there exists a strong association 
between high bilirubin levels and QTc. Corrected QT interval 
refers to the length of ventricular electric inactivity during cardiac 
repolarization, its prolongation increases chances of impairment 
of the cardiac function and ventricular arrhythmias.17 Reddy and 
Boddu showed that QTc was significantly higher in patients with 
liver cirrhosis who were admitted to special care units.18 Earlier a 
study done by Kempler demonstrated that patients with primary 
biliary cirrhosis had remarkable prolongation of the QTc.19
Prolongation of QT interval is multifactorial caused by 
acquired conditions like electrolyte imbalance, alcohol toxicity, 
coronary disease, an autonomic imbalance with sympathetic 
factor hyperactivity, and vagal neuropathy.20,21 QT, QTc, and their 
dispersions were significantly longer (p < 0.01) in patients with 
cirrhosis than in controls.22 QT prolongation was common in liver 
cirrhosis23 and ESLD.24,25 Corrected QT interval prolongation is 
correlated not only with the severity of the cirrhosis but also with 
some of the most severe complications of liver disease, such as, 
hepatorenal syndrome and hepatic encephalopathy.26 Additionally, 
the Child-Pugh score which depicts the severity of cirrhosis is 
statistically related to QTc duration.27 Yet, another study found 
that sudden cardiac deaths due to QTc prolongation in patients 
prepared for liver transplant result in significant loss of resources.28
Since we have got sufficient evidence that QTc can be used 
as a reliable risk factor for eminent arrhythmias, we now need to 
find that “is there a strong association between QTc prolongation 
and mortality?”. Few previous studies by Mahmud et al.,29 Liang 
et al.,30 and Bernal and Wendon31 demonstrated that acute or 
acute-on-chronic liver disease is associated with high short- and 
long-term mortalities. The commonest cause of death among 
patients admitted to the hospitals was liver failure (24%).32 Most 
of the patients with “well-compensated cirrhosis” do not require 
hospital admission and they stay at home. This group of patients, in 
particular, is at high risk of having sudden cardiac death. This could 
be prevented if QTc values are recorded and managed promptly 
by starting empirical anti-arrhythmic medications and by keeping 
such patients under close monitoring.33,34
A prolonged QT interval is associated with an increased risk 
of sudden death due to arrhythmias.35–37 According to various 
studies, after in-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR),

the outcomes are usually poor in patients with ESLD and even 
worse than patients with metastatic cancer, sudden death is also 
considered an important feature of CC.38,39
Corrected QT interval prolongation is commonly found in 
patients with ESLD and it is a significant independent predictor 
of mortality (OR = 1.69, p = 0.039).40 Prolonged QTc (>440 ms) is 
associated with increased mortality (p< 0.05) in liver cirrhosis and 
therefore, QT-prolonging drugs must be prescribed cautiously 
in such patients.41 But a study done by Bal and Thuluvath found 
conflicting results with the studies mentioned above. They 
showed that prolonged QTc interval was common in patients 
with cirrhosis, but its presence had no independent effect on 
mortality.42
Many studies explored the probable pathophysiology behind 
dysrhythmias in jaundiced patients. In this review article, we 
have also tried to find the answer to this question. Experiments 
conducted in humans and animals with cirrhotic liver disease 
have shown marked hemodynamic changes. In the heart, basal 
contractility, responsiveness to β-adrenoceptor activation, and 
excitation-contraction coupling (ECC) are negatively affected in 
models of cirrhosis and portal hypertension with portosystemic 
shunting (PVS) and these events comprise the CC. It was realized 
that the reason behind these events may be the increased levels 
of circulating levels of bile acids.
Zavecz and Battarbee investigated the action of bile acids in 
rats which were anesthetized, and then cirrhosis was induced. 
They found that the bile acids act as a toxicant to myocardial 
cells, as demonstrated by exposing cardiac muscle in vitro to bile 
acids impair the cardiac, in addition to that, there was a depressed 
β-adrenoceptor-mediated inotropism and decreased calcium 
entry during the depolarization phase. These findings suggest 
that lipophilic bile acids have a potential role in the myocardial 
consequences of chronic portal vein stenosis and carbon-tetra 
chloride (CCl4) induced cirrhosis.43
Binah et al. studied the effects of bile acids on ventricular 
muscle and electrophysiological properties, they found that all 
types of bile acids (primary, conjugated, and secondary) in the 
plasma of patients with cholestatic jaundice showed a negative 
inotropic effect. Bile acids caused a reduction in the duration 
of the ventricular action potential, but resting potential, action 
potential amplitude, and maximum upstroke velocity of phase 0 
depolarization remain unaffected.44 Gazawi et al. in a study on in 
rat cardiac membrane demonstrated the effects of deoxycholic 
acid (DCA), chenodeoxycholic acid (C-DCA), and their taurine 
conjugates, namely T-DCA and T-CDCA, on the binding features 
of β-adrenoceptors, membrane fluidity, and the extent of lipid 
peroxidation. They proposed that bile acid is a causative factor 
for the cardiomyopathy of cholestatic liver disease as they cause 
negative inotropism and chronotropism and attenuate cardiac 
responsiveness to sympathetic stimulation. They also modify 
membrane fluidity and generate reactive oxygen species (ROS).45
The role of β-adrenoceptor signal transduction in the 
pathophysiology of CC was studied by Ma et al. in a rat model of 
cirrhosis. They found that it is the contractile element of the heart 
that is impaired in cirrhosis, associated with altered β-adrenergic 
receptor signaling function and guanine nucleotide-binding protein 
expression.46 The relationship between bile acid metabolism and 
cardiac dysfunction has been determined with both in vitro systems 
and experimental models in intact animals.
Direct effects of bile acid exposure can be observed in vitro
using isolated cardiomyocytes and muscle strips. The indirect 
effect of bile metabolism can also be determined through animal 
models of cirrhosis which are known to result in CC.47 Ferreira et 
al. conducted a study to test a hypothesis that bile acids are toxic 
to heart mitochondria for concentrations that are relevant for 
cholestasis. The mitochondria of heart cells were isolated from the 
rat and subjected to incubation with selected bile acids. The authors 
concluded that the bile acids alter mitochondrial bioenergetics 
and cause impairment of mitochondrial function. This may be 
an important cause for the observed cardiac dysfunction during 
cholestasis.48
Torregrosa et al. found that patients with cirrhosis had higher 
left ventricular wall thickness (p < 0.05) and ejection fraction (p <
0.001) than controls.49 Bogin et al., in their experiment, studied the 
effect of jaundiced serum and bile salts on the beating heart cells. 
The jaundiced serum which was collected from the common bile 
duct ligated rats were added to cultured heart cells. It was seen that 
the beating rate of the cultured heart cells decreased, with early 
cessation of beating occurred, associated with the production of 
higher levels of lactate in the media. These findings suggest that 
patients with liver failure produce deoxycholate which is the main 
toxic substance responsible for altering heart function.50 Vasavana 
et al. in their study demonstrated that an elevation of serum bile 
acid concentration is associated with impaired cardiac function, 
the formation of CC.51
The last question raised in our review article was whether high 
serum bilirubin is associated with cardiac dysfunction. It has been 
estimated that almost half of all cases of liver cirrhosis result in the 
development of CC, which shows systolic and diastolic dysfunction, 
changes in the electrophysiology of the heart.52 Chronic liver 
disease is frequently associated with cardiovascular complications, 
such as, tachycardia, myocardial infarction, and congestive heart 
failure as shown in retrospective studies conducted by Matsumori 
et al. and Baratta et al.53,54
Ward et al. conducted a study in a rat model, with induced 
cirrhosis, to explore the underlying mechanisms for the 
electrophysiological abnormalities that develop as a consequence 
of cirrhosis of the liver.55 Various review articles also proved that 
liver disorders have an association with heart abnormalities.56,57
A study designed to assess the cardiac involvement in jaundiced 
patients found a significantly reduced response to intravenous 
dobutamine, as compared to, that seen in the normal controls. It 
suggests that such myocardial refractoriness to β-1 stimulation 
makes jaundiced patients more susceptible to postoperative shock 
and multiorgan failure.58
Ward et al. in their study concluded that cardiac contractility 
is depressed in cirrhotic patients due to malfunction of the Ca2+
-regulatory system.59
On the contrary, Demir et al.60 conducted a study among 102 
patients with non-valvular chronic atrial fibrillation without any 
other cardiovascular disease (mean age 62.51 ± 5.88) and found that 
total, direct, and indirect serum bilirubin levels were significantly 
lower among persons with atrial fibrillation when compared with 
controls (p < 0.001), respectively. They concluded that an inverse 
relationship exists between serum bilirubin and non-valvular 
atrial fibrillation. Similarly, Cüre et al.61 in their observational study 
found that Gilbert syndrome patients are associated with increased 
bilirubin levels which consequently might decrease the incidence

of cardiac arrhythmias, suggesting myocardial protection provided 
by serum bilirubin levels.
Co n c lu sio n
The evidence included in our review suggested that cardiac 
arrhythmias are associated with high levels of serum bilirubin 
levels, QTc is a reliable risk factor for imminent arrhythmias, and it 
is associated with mortality. Approximately 50% of liver cirrhosis 
cases develop CC. The basic pathophysiology behind this is the 
bile acids that cause prolonging the QT interval. They cause cardiac 
hypertrophy and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. Also, a high level 
of serum bilirubin is associated with cardiac dysfunction. These 
observations directly suggest that there has been an association 
between liver abnormalities and cardiac pathology.
Fu t u r e Pe r spe c tiv e
We have tried our best to depict the relationship between the 
pathologies of liver and heart and the probable mechanism behind 
this association through the evidence present in the literature but 
further randomized controlled studies are needed to establish the 
causality between these two.
