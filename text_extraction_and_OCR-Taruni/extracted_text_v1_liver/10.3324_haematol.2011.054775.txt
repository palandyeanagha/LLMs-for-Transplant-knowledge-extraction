Background
Studies evaluating risk factors for in-hospital venous thromboembolism in children are limited
by quality assurance of case definition and/or lack of controlled comparison. The objective of
this study is to determine risk factors for the development of in-hospital venous thromboembolism in children.
Design and Methods
In a case-control study at The Children’s Hospital, Colorado, from 1st January 2003 to 31st
December 2009 we employed diagnostic validation methods to determine pediatric in-hospital
venous thromboembolism risk factors. Clinical data on putative risk factors were retrospectively collected from medical records of children with International Classification of Diseases, 9th
edition codes of venous thromboembolism at discharge, in whom radiological reports confirmed venous thromboembolism and no signs/symptoms of venous thromboembolism were
noted on admission.
Results
We verified 78 cases of in-hospital venous thromboembolism, yielding an average incidence of
5 per 10,000 hospitalized children per year. Logistical regression analyses revealed that
mechanical ventilation, systemic infection, and hospitalization duration of five days or over
were statistically significant, independent risk factors for in-hospital venous thromboembolism
(OR=3.29, 95%CI=1.53-7.06, P=0.002; OR=3.05, 95%CI=1.57-5.94, P=0.001; and OR=1.03,
95%CI=1.01-1.04, P=0.001, respectively). Using these factors in a risk model, post-test probability of venous thromboembolism was 3.6%.
Conclusions
These data indicate that risk of in-hospital venous thromboembolism in children with this risk
factor combination may exceed that of hospitalized adults in whom prophylactic anticoagulation is indicated. Substantiation of these findings via multicenter studies could provide the basis
for future risk-stratified randomized control trials of pediatric venous thromboembolism prevention.

ABSTRACT

Introduction
Venous thromboembolism (VTE), comprised of deep
venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE),
affects an estimated 350,000 to 600,000 Americans each
year, and together, DVT and PE are estimated to contribute to at least 100,000 deaths each year.
1 The recognition of the public health burden imposed by VTE, and the
extent to which many cases (particularly hospital-acquired
VTE) are preventable prompted a Call-to-Action by the
United States Surgeon General in 2008.
1 As part of this
effort, a Surgeon General’s Working Group identified
research into risk factors for development of VTE in children, and adverse outcomes of VTE in this population
(such as the development of post-thrombotic syndrome
following limb DVT) as an important priority.
2
While the incidence of VTE is considerably lower in
children than adults, and has been estimated at 5 per
10,000 per year from the National Hospital Discharge
Survey,
3 more recent data suggest that pediatric VTE incidence may be dramatically increasing.
4 At the same time,
the consequences of DVT and PE in children are substantial. Sixteen to 20% of children with VTE have objectively
confirmed PE,
5 and retrospective data from the Hospital
for Sick Children indicated a VTE-specific mortality rate of
9% among pediatric PE cases.
6 The risks of long-term pulmonary insufficiency and of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension following PE in children remain
undefined. Additionally, a systematic review of the pediatric literature has demonstrated that at least 20% of children with limb DVT develop post-thrombotic syndrome
(PTS), a syndrome of chronic venous insufficiency often
associated with limitation in age-appropriate physical
activities that are critical to normal growth and development.
7
Recommendations for prevention of hospital-acquired
VTE in adults are well established8 and have been
informed by evidence from randomized controlled clinical
trials. In pediatrics, such recommendations and data are
largely lacking, historically attributable to the rarity of
VTE in this population. A non-selective (i.e. non-riskstratified) approach to VTE prevention in hospitalized
children through prophylactic anticoagulation would
undoubtedly expose an excess of these young patients to
bleeding risks in order to prevent relatively few deaths and
long-term sequelae from VTE. While registries and cohort
studies have identified central venous catheterization and
infection as highly prevalent among pediatric VTE cases,
few well-designed case-control studies employing diagnostic validation have been published that establish a significant increase in odds of VTE associated with these or
other candidate risk factors for a selective approach to
VTE prevention in hospitalized children. The development of such evidence, and its substantiation via subsequent multicenter studies, would provide the basis for
future risk-stratified RCTs of pediatric VTE prevention.
Accordingly, the objective of this work was to determine risk factors for the development of in-hospital VTE
in children, in the context of a single institution case-control study. We employed diagnostic validation methods to
overcome the limitations of International Classification of
Diseases, 9th edition (ICD-9) codes in pediatric VTE (for
which evidence of validity and diagnostic performance
has not been published), as well as the challenge of distinguishing pre-hospital versus in-hospital onset of VTE.
Design and Methods
Subjects
We retrospectively reviewed medical records of consecutive
children (age birth through to 21 years old) hospitalized at the
Children’s Hospital Colorado, a 300-bed, tertiary care pediatric
referral center with approximately 20 subspeciality sections, from
1st January 2003 to 31st December 2009 in whom ICD-9 diagnosis
codes at discharge included VTE (cases), as well as records of children in whom these diagnoses were absent (contemporaneous
controls). The pertinent ICD-9 codes were 453.2 (inferior vena
cava thrombus), 453.4 (venous thromboembolism of deep vessels
of the lower extremity), 453.8 (embolism or thrombosis of other
specified veins), 453.9 (embolism and thrombosis of unspecified
site), and 415.1 (pulmonary embolism and infarction). Case definition of in-hospital VTE was further refined by the following validation criteria: 1) supporting radiological evidence of VTE, as previously defined9 (using compression ultrasonography with
Doppler imaging for objective confirmation of extremity DVT,
with CT or MRI for suspected extension into deep pelvic or
abdominal veins, and spiral CT for PE confirmation), no sooner
than Day 2 of hospitalization; 2) absence of documentation of
signs or symptoms consistent with VTE in the admission history
and physical exam; 3) length of hospitalization at least two days.
Presence of risk factors (including central venous catheters, CVCs),
was defined according to the admission history, and hence preceded the diagnosis of VTE (as per criterion #1 above). Controls were
selected from a patient database provided by the institution’s
Clinical Research Data Warehouse based upon stated eligibility
criteria, and then matched with cases on age (exact year-matching), gender, and hospital unit location (pediatric intensive care
unit, PICU; neonatal intensive care unit, NICU; cardiac intensive
care unit, CICU; and non-ICU floor) at time of VTE diagnosis.
Subsequently, controls were assigned a study ID number, and for
each case, 2 controls were randomly selected, using a web-based
random number generator program. Definition of hospitalized
controls was further refined by duration of hospitalization of at
least two days, and the validation criterion of absence of an
impression of VTE among reports in the radiological record. Case
and control criteria were confirmed by 2 independent reviewers
(BB and NAG). The study was approved by the Colorado Multiple
Institutional Review Board.
Data collection
Demographic data were extracted on age, gender, date of
admission, and hospital unit location. In addition, clinical data on
putative risk factors for VTE were retrospectively collected on
cases and controls, including duration of hospitalization and presence/absence (and details) of the following: mechanical ventilation, systemic infection, central venous catheterization, chronic
inflammatory disease, malignancy, surgery, dehydration, and obesity (measured as body mass index > 95th percentile for age, using
CDC criteria).
10 Chronic inflammatory disease included Crohn’s
disease (n=1), ulcerative colitis (n=1), graft-versus-host-disease
(n=1), autoimmune encephalitis (n=1) and necrotizing enterocolitis (n=1). Dehydration was identified based upon its notation in
the admission history, and infection was noted based upon a
description of systemic (non-localized) infection present in the
admission or discharge history. Presence of central venous
catheter (CVC) was divided into long-term CVC (Broviac,
Mediport, etc.) versus short-term CVC (PICC line, temporary internal jugular or femoral line, etc.).
Statistical analyses
Descriptive statistics were used to define distributions of con510 haematologica | 2012; 97(4)

tinuous variables and frequencies and proportions of categorical
variables, which were then compared between cases and controls via Mann-Whitney U and χ2 tests, respectively. Fisher’s
exact test was used in lieu of χ2 in instances of a two-by-two
table with a frequency value of 5 or under in at least one cell.
Univariate and multiple logistic regression was employed to
evaluate for unadjusted and adjusted associations between putative risk factors and case/control status; results were expressed
as odds ratios (ORs), with accompanying 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) calculated by the Wald method. A significance
threshold defined a priori as P<0.2 was used for inclusion of
explanatory variables into multiple logistic regression.
Otherwise, for all hypothesis testing, P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. All hypothesis tests were two-tailed. χ2 tests
were performed using Epi Info version 3.3.2 (Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA), and all other
hypothesis tests were conducted using SAS 9.1 statistical software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Positive likelihood ratios
were calculated as sensitivity + (1-specificity), and negative likelihood ratios were calculated as specificity + (1-sensitivity), with
corresponding confidence intervals determined as previously
described.

Results
Seventy-eight cases of in-hospital VTE were confirmed
during the 7-year period of observation, after application
of the validation criteria (see Design and Methods section).
Figure 1 provides a flow diagram of case selection.
Notably, the discharge diagnosis ICD-9 codes used to
identify cases were found to have a specificity of 38%
(131 of 345) for VTE, and of 23% (78 of 345) for in-hospital (i.e. hospital-acquired) VTE, in children. Given 22,094
hospitalizations of at least two days during the seven
years of the study, this yielded an average in-hospital VTE
incidence of 5 per 10,000 hospitalized children per year.
Cases were matched by age, gender, date of hospitalization, and hospital unit location (PICU, CICU, NICU, and
non-ICU floor) to 160 randomly selected controls.
Demographic characteristics and frequency of putative
risk factors for VTE are shown in Table 1 for cases versus
controls. Peak VTE frequency was observed in infancy.
The median time from hospital admission to VTE diagnosis was seven days (range 1-73 days). Nearly 80% of cases
were mechanically ventilated, and the prevalence of sysFigure 1. Flow diagram showing the inclusion and exclusion criteria for selection of

temic infection was approximately 60%. Long-term CVCs
(Broviacs, Mediports, etc.) were identified in fewer than
20% of catheterized patients, with the remainder having
short-term CVCs (PICC lines, temporary internal jugular
or femoral lines, etc.). Short-term catheterization was
present in approximately 50% of cases and in 27% of controls. No difference in the presence of long-term catheterization was noted between the cases and controls. The
proportion of children that had three or more putative risk
factors for VTE was significantly greater among cases than
controls (80% vs. 38%, respectively; P<0.001). This corresponded to an OR of 6.06 (95%CI 3.22-11.4; P<0.001) for
VTE development during hospitalization in patients who
have three or more risk factors. Rate of previous hospitalization within 30 days was similar between cases and controls (13% vs. 14%; P=1.00).
Table 2 presents the results of unadjusted and adjusted
odds of VTE associated with putative risk factors among
all subjects, from univariate and multiple logistical regression. In univariate analyses, mechanical ventilation, a central venous catheter, systemic infection, and length of hospitalization were identified as statistically significant risk
factors for development of in-hospital VTE. In multiple
logistic regression, mechanical ventilation, systemic infection, and length of hospitalization served as statistically
significant, independent risk factors for development of inhospital VTE (OR=3.29, 95%CI=1.53-7.06, P=0.002;
OR=3.05, 95%CI=1.57-5.94, P=0.001; and OR=1.03,
95%CI=1.01-1.04, P=0.001, respectively). The odds ratio
for length of hospitalization indicated that, with each
additional day of hospitalization, the odds of in-hospital
VTE increases by 3%.
Subgroup analyses of risk factor profiles by hospital unit
location revealed no statistically significant VTE risk factors for patients in the CICU. In the NICU, univariate
analyses identified surgery and length of hospitalization as
statistically significant risk factors for the development of
in-hospital VTE (OR=4.22, 95%CI=1.25-14.3, P=0.02; and
OR=1.02, 95%CI=1.00-1.04, P=0.006, respectively). In
multiple logistic regression, however, only length of hospitalization of five days or more was a statistically significant, independent risk factor (OR=1.02, 95%CI=1.003-
1.04, P=0.02). In the PICU, mechanical ventilation, systemic infection, cancer, and length of hospitalization were
each shown to be statistically significant, independent risk
factors for in-hospital VTE (OR=4.96, 95%CI=0.97-25.4,
P=0.005; OR=12.6, 95%CI=2.86-55.8, P<0.001; OR=45.8,
95%CI=1.51-999, P=0.03; and OR=1.08, 95%CI=1.03-
1,12, P=0.001, respectively).
The combination of mechanical ventilation, systemic
infection, and length of hospitalization of five days or over
had a hospital-wide sensitivity of 45% (95%CI: 34-57%)
and a specificity of 95% (95%CI: 90-98%) for development
of in-hospital VTE. Using these factors in a risk model,
post-test probability of VTE was 3.1%. This same combination of risk factors when applied specifically in the PICU
setting had a sensitivity of 47% (95%CI: 31-64%) and a

specificity of 88% (95%CI: 77-94%) for development of inhospital VTE. The post-test probability of in-hospital VTE
using these factors in a risk model was 0.95% in the specific setting of the PICU. Corresponding likelihood ratios and
pre- and post-test probabilities using the model from multivariate data in Table 2 are shown in Table 3.
Discussion
The present work provides unique data on risk factors
for development of pediatric in-hospital VTE, by means of
a case-control study employing diagnostic validation. It
reveals that patients who possess any three or more putative risk factors shown in Table 1 have a 6-fold increase in
odds of in-hospital VTE. A specific risk factor model,
based upon the statistically significant independent risk
factors of in-hospital VTE in children identified in this
study, comprises mechanical ventilation, systemic infection, and length of hospitalization greater than or equal to
five days. This risk factor model is 45% sensitive and 95%
specific for in-hospital VTE with a post-test probability of
VTE of 3.1% in a hospital-wide setting, and 0.95% in the
PICU setting.
The presence of a central venous catheter was statistically significant in univariate analyses and has been consistently shown in the literature to be clinically important
as a risk factor for VTE in children.
12 However, since CVC
are frequently placed temporarily in hospitalized children
for blood sampling, fluid resuscitation, and medication or
blood product administration, and yet the incidence of
VTE in children is rather low, it was not surprising that the
presence of a short-term CVC was only shown in unadjusted analyses to be a significant risk factor for pediatric
in-hospital VTE, and not as an independent risk factor in
analyses adjusted for other demonstrated risk factors.
While our analysis did not support long-term CVC as an
independent risk factor for in-hospital VTE, it is possible
that there may still be an independent association for outpatient VTE in children.
Prior data on risk factors for in-hospital VTE in unselected children are limited to a few studies. In a recent restrospective analysis using the Kids’ Inpatient Database, independent risk factors for development of DVT in hospitalized children included age 15 years or over, obesity,
inflammatory bowel disease, hematologic malignancy,
and thoraco-abdominal or orthopedic surgery.
13 By contrast, in a retrospective analysis of the Riley Children’s
Hospital experience, Sandoval and colleagues observed no
consistent trend of increasing VTE risk with age, but
rather a bimodal distribution of age with respect to hospital-acquired DVT, with peaks in infancy and adolescence.
14 In one of the only prospective studies of in-hospital DVT, Rohrer and colleagues observed one case of inhospital DVT in 59 at-risk children (defined by the presence of two risk factors, including surgery, trauma, immobility, stroke, cancer, sepsis, femoral venous catheterization, prior VTE, and known thrombophilia), from among
1,779 consecutive hospitalized children over a 6-month
period at the University of Massachusetts Medical
Center.
15 This finding emphasizes the need for further
risk-stratification (i.e. greater selection) in identifying
those hospitalized children at appreciably increased risk of
VTE; yet, such efforts are hindered by the lack of evidence
substantiating risk factors for in-hospital VTE from welldesigned pediatric case-control studies.
Review of pediatric trauma-specific literature reveals
many of the same VTE risk factors determined in the present work. A recent study from the Children’s Hospital of
Wisconsin PICU demonstrated increased VTE risk in trauma patients with multiple risk factors such as immobility,
poor perfusion, and CVC, with a median of nine days
until VTE diagnosis, suggesting that it is critical to identify
children at highest risk for VTE.
16 This study found that
each additional risk factor caused a 3-fold increase in risk
for VTE development, which is similar to our findings, as
shown in Table 1. An analysis of the 2003 Healthcare Cost
and Utilization Project Kids' Inpatient Database showed
that VTE was identified in 2.7 per 1,000 pediatric trauma
discharges (using ICD-9 codes for trauma definitions) and,
using ICD-9 codes or procedure codes for risk factor identification, also demonstrated that VTE risk was strongly
correlated with surgery, CVC, and severity of injury.
17 The
use of a risk score to identify patients more likely to develop VTE may help mitigate the increased resource utilization by these patients by targeting them for preventative
measures.
The lack of published data regarding validity of ICD-9
codes in pediatric VTE and the registry structure of data
collection in pediatric VTE poses challenges to data quality
of the existing literature on risk factors for VTE. Indeed,
the discharge diagnosis ICD-9 codes used to identify cases
in our study had a specificity of only 38% for VTE, and of
only 23% for in-hospital VTE, in children. Among the
aforementioned studies, only Sandoval et al. utilized radiological confirmation of VTE as a validation criterion for
ICD-9-based VTE diagnosis, and of in-hospital (vs. prehospital) VTE based upon absence/presence of these ICD9 codes among the admission diagnoses.
14 Unfortunately,
while that study showed a high prevalence of CVC, infection, surgery, and malignancy among children with in-hospital DVT, it did not establish an increased risk in VTE
associated with these predisposing conditions, via comparison of their frequencies among a control group of hospitalized children who did not develop VTE in the hospital. We employed a similar validation criteria approach to
Sandoval and colleagues,
14 but further evaluated each
admission record for the presence of signs and symptoms
(unilateral limb pain/swelling) compatible with limb DVT,
in order to exclude pre-hospital DVT episodes in which

Pediatric in-hospital VTE risk factors

diagnosis was delayed.
Previous work has also evaluated risk factors for pediatric VTE outside a hospital setting, focusing on specific
medical conditions. VTE risk factors identified in children
with nephrotic syndrome have included age over 12 years,
severity of proteinuria, and prior history of VTE.
18 In addition, among children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia
undergoing induction chemotherapy, a meta-analysis has
identified E. coli-derived L-asparaginase, concomitant corticosteroid use, presence of a CVC, and genetic thrombophilia as putative risk factors for VTE development.
19 A
subsequent multicenter European cohort study confirmed
that higher risk scores (based upon greater number of
these risk factors) were associated with heightened VTE
risk in pediatric ALL, and on an exploratory basis suggested that use of enoxaparin prophylaxis during induction in
these children reduced the risk of VTE.
20
Anticoagulant primary prevention against VTE in hospitalized adults is well established both with respect to surgical and medical prophylaxis.
21 By contrast, evidence for
efficacy and safety of anticoagulant primary prophylaxis
against VTE in hospitalized children is largely lacking. The
few clinical trials that have evaluated anticoagulant prevention against VTE in hospitalized children,
22 and those
that have involved both inpatient and outpatient settings,
23,24 have generally failed to show efficacy; this is likely due in large part to the need for greater risk-stratification of these populations (pediatric cardiac surgery
patients with a central venous catheter, pediatric cancer
patients with a central venous catheter, etc.). The recent
findings of Raffini and colleagues from the Children’s
Hospital of Philadelphia, demonstrating increased use of
VTE prophylaxis in high-risk patients by using risk-based
guidelines,
25 are a testament to the importance of risk evaluation as a basis for appropriate prevention strategies.
Our present findings, if substantiated by further prospective studies, provide the basis for greater risk stratification
for pediatric in-hospital VTE.
Key limitations of the present work include the retrospective nature of the analysis, the lack of follow up after
hospital discharge to determine if any symptoms of VTE
had developed beyond hospitalization (hence the pertinence of our findings to “in-hospital” rather than “hospital-acquired” VTE), and the heterogeneity of the patient
population. It should be recognized that restriction of case
identification to the period of hospitalization is likely to
underestimate the magnitude of the problem. Also, the
sensitivity of ICD-9 discharge diagnosis codes for VTE in
children has not been established, and therefore the rate of
VTE identified in the present work may be an underestimate. To that end, we have addressed the suboptimal utility of sensitivity of ICD-9 discharge diagnosis codes for
clinical research in pediatric VTE in a separate manuscript
via a different study design (prospective inception cohort)
involving known thrombosis patients followed longitudinally via our subspeciality thrombosis clinic.
In addition, given the limitations posed by the number of
cases identified, most risk factors were analyzed as broad
categories (e.g. surgery, inflammatory condition), such that
differential risk within these groupings (e.g. orthopedic surgery vs. thoraco-abdominal surgery, systemic lupus erythematosus vs. inflammatory bowel disease, emergent vs. elective central venous catheterization) was not analyzed, and
should be evaluated in larger cooperative studies. Similarly,
given the small numbers of patients with cancer, the magnitude of this risk factor shown to be significant in the
PICU setting is imprecise. We were unable to discern risk
factor profiles in the CICU, likely due in part to frequent
use of prophylactic anticoagulation in the post-operative
period in the CICU at our institution in children weighing
less than 10 kg with a CVC in place. Furthermore, we had
only limited ability to discern risk factors in the NICU.
While patient heterogeneity is a potential limitation of the
study, it can also be perceived as advantageous with regard
to external validity (i.e. generalizability) of our findings to
the pediatric in-hospital VTE population at large.
Nevertheless, our data from the Children’s Hospital
Colorado, are most applicable to pediatric tertiary care hospitals, and may not be generalizable to community hospitals where children are admitted.
A few more minor limitations are also noteworthy.
While we were unable to readily determine usage of prophylactic anticoagulation given the limitations of pharmacy data (including dosing, duration, and indication), it
should be noted that prophylactic anticoagulation was not
the standard of care at our institution, except in the postoperative subgroup of CICU patients as mentioned above.
In addition, because length of hospitalization cannot be
precisely known at the time of admission, this identified
risk factor presents challenges for implementation in a
VTE prevention algorithm upon hospital admission.
Indeed, this limitation is shared by many studies in the
VTE risk factor literature, which have consistently implicated length of stay as an important risk factor. At the
same time, the number and severity of problems/underlying conditions noted on admission are often used clinically
to grossly estimate anticipated duration of hospitalization
for patient disposition purposes. Therefore, the use of a
length of hospitalization threshold of at least five days in
the present risk model is felt to be pragmatic for future
application based upon anticipated length of stay.
Alternatively, prophylactic anticoagulation could be withheld until the length of hospitalization reaches five days
(in the presence of the other described risk factors), recognizing that such an approach may not prevent VTE in
cases in which the pathophysiological process has begun
soon after admission.
Notwithstanding these limitations, the validation criteria employed toward the definition of in-hospital VTE in
the present work provide high-quality retrospective data
on risk factors for development of in-hospital VTE in children. Our findings identify a combination of clinical risk of
factors that has prognostic utility for the development inhospital VTE in children. Their substantiation via subsequent prospective multicenter studies would provide the
basis for a future pilot study of safety and preliminary efficacy of primary prophylactic anticoagulation in the highest-risk group of patients. If this pilot study yields favorable results, a more definitive multicenter risk-stratified
RCT of pediatric VTE prevention could be performed.
