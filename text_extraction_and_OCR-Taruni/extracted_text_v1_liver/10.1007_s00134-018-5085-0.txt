The Surviving Sepsis Campaign Bundle: 
2018 update

Introduction
Te “sepsis bundle” has been central to the implementation of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) from the 
frst publication of its evidence-based guidelines in 2004 
through subsequent editions [1–6]. Developed separately 
from the guidelines publication by the SSC, the bundles 
have been the cornerstone of sepsis quality improvement since 2005 [7–11]. As noted when they were introduced, the bundle elements were designed to be updated 
as indicated by new evidence and have evolved accordingly. In response to the publication of “Surviving Sepsis 
Campaign: International Guidelines for Management of 
Sepsis and Septic Shock: 2016” [12, 13], a revised “hour-1 
bundle” has been developed and is presented below 
(Fig. 1).
Te compelling nature of the evidence in the literature, 
which has demonstrated an association between compliance with bundles and improved survival in patients 
with sepsis and septic shock, led to the adoption of the 
SSC measures by the National Quality Forum (NQF) and 
subsequently both by the New York State (NYS) Department of Health [14] and the Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services (CMS) [15] in the USA for mandated 
public reporting. Te important relationship between the 
bundles and survival was confrmed in a publication from 
this NYS initiative [16].
Paramount in the management of patients with sepsis is the concept that sepsis is a medical emergency. As 
with polytrauma, acute myocardial infarction, and stroke, 
early identifcation and appropriate immediate management in the initial hours after development of sepsis 
improves outcomes [7–11, 14, 16–21]. Te guidelines 
state that these patients need urgent assessment and 
treatment, including initial fuid resuscitation while pursuing source control, obtaining further laboratory results, 
and attaining more precise measurements of hemodynamic status. A guiding principle is that these complex 
patients need a detailed initial assessment and then ongoing re-evaluation of their response to treatment. Te elements of the 2018 bundle, intended to be initiated within 
the frst hour, are listed in Table 1 and presented in the 
following. Consistent with previous iterations of the SSC 
sepsis bundles, “time zero” or “time of presentation” is 
defned as the time of triage in the emergency department or, if referred from another care location, from the 
earliest chart annotation consistent with all elements 
of sepsis (formerly severe sepsis) or septic shock ascertained through chart review. Because this new bundle is 
based on the 2016 Guidelines publication, the guidelines 
themselves should be referred to for further discussion 
and evidence related to each element and to sepsis management as a whole.
Hour‑1 bundle
Te most important change in the revision of the SSC 
bundles is that the 3-h and 6-h bundles have been combined into a single “hour-1 bundle” with the explicit 
intention of beginning resuscitation and management 
immediately. We believe this refects the clinical reality 
at the bedside of these seriously ill patients with sepsis 
and septic shock—that clinicians begin treatment immediately, especially in patients with hypotension, rather 
than waiting or extending resuscitation measures over a 
longer period. More than 1 h may be required for resuscitation to be completed, but initiation of resuscitation and 
treatment, such as obtaining blood for measuring lactate 
and blood cultures, administration of fuids and antibiotics, and in the case of life-threatening hypotension, initiation of vasopressor therapy, are all begun immediately.

It is also important to note that there are no published 
studies that have evaluated the efcacy in important 
subgroups, including burns and immunocompromised 
patients. Tis knowledge gap needs to be addressed in 
future studies specifcally targeting these subgroups. Te 
elements included in the revised bundle are taken from 
the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines, and the level 
of evidence in support of each element can be seen in 
Table 1 [12, 13]. We believe the new bundle is an accurate 
refection of actual clinical care.
Measure lactate level
While serum lactate is not a direct measure of tissue 
perfusion [22], it can serve as a surrogate, as increases 
may represent tissue hypoxia, accelerated aerobic glycolysis driven by excess beta-adrenergic stimulation, or 
other causes associated with worse outcomes [23]. Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated a signifcant 
reduction in mortality with lactate-guided resuscitation 
[24–28].
If initial lactate is elevated (>2  mmol/L), it should be 
remeasured within 2–4  h to guide resuscitation to normalize lactate in patients with elevated lactate levels as a 
marker of tissue hypoperfusion [24].
Obtain blood cultures prior to antibiotics
Sterilization of cultures can occur within minutes of the 
frst dose of an appropriate antimicrobial [29, 30], so cultures must be obtained before antibiotic administration 
to optimize the identifcation of pathogens and improve 
outcomes [31, 32]. Appropriate blood cultures include at 
least two sets (aerobic and anaerobic). Administration of 
appropriate antibiotic therapy should not be delayed in 
order to obtain blood cultures.
Administer broad‑spectrum antibiotics
Empiric broad-spectrum therapy with one or more intravenous antimicrobials to cover all likely pathogens should 
be started immediately [21] for patients presenting with 
sepsis or septic shock. Empiric antimicrobial therapy 
should be narrowed once pathogen identifcation and 
sensitivities are established, or discontinued if a decision 
is made that the patient does not have infection. Te link 
between early administration of antibiotics for suspected 
infection and antibiotic stewardship remains an essential 
aspect of high-quality sepsis management. If infection 
is subsequently proven not to exist, then antimicrobials 
should be discontinued.

Administer intravenous fuid
Early efective fuid resuscitation is crucial for the stabilization of sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion or septic 
shock. Given the urgent nature of this medical emergency, initial fuid resuscitation should begin immediately upon recognizing a patient with sepsis and/or 
hypotension and elevated lactate, and completed within 
3  h of recognition. Te guidelines recommend this 
should comprise a minimum of 30 ml/kg of intravenous 
crystalloid fuid. Although little literature includes controlled data to support this volume, recent interventional 
studies have described this as usual practice in the early 
stages of resuscitation, and observational evidence is supportive [7, 8]. Te absence of any clear beneft following 
the administration of colloid compared with crystalloid 
solutions in the combined subgroups of sepsis, in conjunction with the expense of albumin, supports a strong 
recommendation for the use of crystalloid solutions in 
the initial resuscitation of patients with sepsis and septic 
shock. Because some evidence indicates that a sustained 
positive fuid balance during ICU stay is harmful [33–37], 
fuid administration beyond initial resuscitation requires 
careful assessment of the likelihood that the patient 
remains fuid responsive.
Apply vasopressors
Urgent restoration of an adequate perfusion pressure to 
the vital organs is a key part of resuscitation. Tis should 
not be delayed. If blood pressure is not restored after initial fuid resuscitation, then vasopressors should be commenced within the frst hour to achieve mean arterial 
pressure (MAP) of≥65 mm Hg. Te physiologic efects 
of vasopressors and combined inotrope/vasopressor 
selection in septic shock are outlined in a large number of 
literature reviews [38–47].
Summary
Previous iterations of the sepsis bundle were introduced 
as a means of providing education and improvement 
related to sepsis management. Te literature supports the 
use of sepsis bundles for improving outcomes in patients 
with sepsis and septic shock. Tis new sepsis “hour-1 
bundle,” based on the 2016 guidelines, should be introduced to emergency department, foor, and ICU staf as 
the next iteration of ever-improving tools in the care of 
patients with sepsis and septic shock as we all work to 
lessen the global burden of sepsis.
