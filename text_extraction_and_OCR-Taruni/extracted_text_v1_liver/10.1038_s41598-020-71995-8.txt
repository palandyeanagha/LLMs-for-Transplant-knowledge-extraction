Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is major health burden lacking efective pharmacological 
therapies. Clinical trials enrol patients with histologically-defned NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver 
disease) activity score (NAS)≥ 4 and Kleiner-Brunt fbrosis stage (F)≥ 2; however, screen failure rates 
are often high following biopsy. This study evaluated a non-invasive MRI biomarker, iron-corrected 
T1 mapping (cT1), as a diagnostic pre-screening biomarker for NASH. In a retrospective analysis of 
86 biopsy confrmed NAFLD patients we explored the potential of blood and imaging biomarkers, 
both in isolation and in combination, to discriminate those who have NAS≥ 4 and F ≥ 2 from those 
without. Stepwise logistic regression was performed to select the optimal combination of biomarkers, 
diagnostic accuracy was determined using area under the receiver operator curve and model validated 
confrmed with and fvefold cross-validation. Results showed that levels of cT1, AST, GGT and fasting 
glucose were all good predictors of NAS≥ 4 and F ≥ 2, and the model identifed the combination of 
cT1-AST-fasting glucose (cTAG) as far superior to any individual biomarker (AUC 0.90 [0.84–0.97]). This 
highlights the potential utility of the composite cTAG score for screening patients prior to biopsy to 
identify those suitable for NASH clinical trial enrolment.
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is one of the most common forms of chronic liver disease, and a 
component of the metabolic syndrome, afecting 60% to 70% of patients with type 2 diabetes1–3
. Non-alcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH) is a more progressive subtype of NAFLD with a 3–12% prevalence4,5
, and is predicted to 
become the leading aetiology for liver transplantation6
. NASH is characterised histologically by the presence of 
hepatocyte ballooning degeneration, hepatic lobular infammation and presence of hepatic steatosis with patients 
at increased risk of fbrosis and progression to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, cardiovascular disease, and 
death7
. Te frst pharmacological treatment for NASH, the FXR agonist obeticholic acid, is expected to receive 
regulatory approval in 20208
, but there are a further 5 drugs in phase III clinical trials with approximately 130 
active trials in total. Te NAFLD Activity Score (NAS), proposed by the NASH Clinical Research Network 
(NASH-CRN) is one of the most frequently used histological scoring systems in NASH clinical trials. NAS is 
derived by summing the histological staging for liver fat (stage 0–3), lobular infammation (stage 0–3), and

ballooning (stage 0–2), with a NAS of 4 or greater typically regarded NASH9. While fbrosis stage does not form 
part of the NAS, enrolment criteria for NASH clinical trials now typically requires patients to not only have a 
NAS≥4 but also evidence of fbrosis of stage 2 or more (scored using the Kleiner-Brunt (0–4) scale. Tis is as a 
result of rapidly evolving understanding of disease pathology, progression, and a growing body of evidence to 
support the bi-directional nature of fbrosis and its prognostic value in both liver-related and overall mortality, 
independent of NASH10,11. Identifying patients most likely to meet the NASH-CRN enrolment criteria on biopsy 
is an on-going challenge, with existing clinical indicators lacking both sensitivity and specifcity. As a result, 
NASH trials ofen sufer from high levels of screen failure following central review of the baseline liver biopsy. 
In fact, 73% and 65% of biopsied subjects from PIVENS and CENTAR NASH clinical trials, respectively, did not 
meet the eligibility criteria12,13. Pre-biopsy enrichment strategies are becoming increasingly popular to reduce the 
number of screen failures and metrics derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) such as iron-corrected 
T1 (cT1)-mapping and proton density fat fraction (PDFF) are emerging as promising non-invasive diagnostic 
biomarkers in NASH.
T1 mapping has shown promise as an efective imaging biomarker of infammation (I) and fbrosis in 
myocardium14,15 and liver16, and as a prognostic biomarker for predicting clinical outcomes in chronic liver disease patients17,18. Te presence of iron however, which can be accurately measured from MRI-T2star relaxation 
time (T2*), opposes the MR signal and artifcially shortens the T1 relaxation time19, thus needs to be accounted 
for. LiverMultiScan (Perspectum Ltd, UK) quantifes iron-corrected T1 (cT1)20, by removing the confounding 
efect of elevated iron on liver T1. Liver cT1 has been shown to correlate with the hallmarks of fbro-infammatory 
disease16,20,21 and shows promise as a risk stratifcation tool in NASH16. PDFF distinguishes the proportion of 
the MR-visible protons due to fat from all MR-visible protons (attributable to both fat and water) expressed as a 
percent, and has been widely reported to correlate very well with histologically graded liver steatosis22–28. Despite 
PDFF not routinely being reported to show correlation with the other histological features of NASH, and in fact 
decreases with advancing fbrosis27,29, it has been well accepted by the NASH community as a biomarker for 
clinical trials, both as a screening tool to identify suitable participants for trial enrolment, and as an exploratory 
endpoint for treatment efcacy30,31.
Many biomarkers have been investigated to identify NASH patients including clinical, biochemical, metabolic, 
and lipid analytes that predict some of the molecular mechanisms of the pathogenesis and progression of NAFLD. 
NAFLD pathogenesis is complex and it is very unlikely that a single biomarker can reliably distinguish NASH32. 
With this in mind, this study aimed to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of image-derived biomarkers and a host 
of circulating biomarkers that were acquired as part of standard care, both independently and in combination, 
for identifying NAFLD patients with clinical trial enrolment criteria of NAS≥4 and F≥2.
Methods
Study design, setting. Tis was a retrospective analysis of data combined from two prospective, cross-sectional studies into the utility of MRI methods to evaluate liver disease. Te CALM study33 invited adult patients 
scheduled for a standard-of-care liver biopsy to investigate known or suspected liver disease from two large 
tertiary UK liver centres (Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham and Royal Infrmary of Edinburgh) between 
February 2014 and September 2015. Te RIAL/NICOLA study34 invited all patients referred for liver biopsy at 
two UK study centres (Oxford and Reading) between March 2011 and May 2015 to take part. Patient exclusion 
criteria were inability or unwillingness to give fully informed consent, any contraindication to MRI, and liver 
biopsy targeted at a focal liver lesion. For the purpose of this analysis only those patients with a primary diagnosis of either NAFLD or NASH who had not undergone liver transplantation were included. Patients underwent 
standard of care liver function blood tests and liver biopsy, and also underwent LiverMultiScan to measure cT1 
and PDFF. We refer to the combination of RIAL/NICOLA and CALM data sets as the ‘original dataset’.
Both the studies were conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki 2013 
and Good Clinical Practice Guidelines. Te RIAL study was approved by the institutional review departments 
at the University of Oxford and by the National Review Ethics Service (South Central; Ref: 11/H0504/2). Te 
CALM study was approved by the institutional review departments at the University of Birmingham and by the 
National Review Ethics Service (West Midlands—Te Black Country; Ref: 14/WM/0010). All participants gave 
written informed consent. Te RIAL study was registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01543646) and was sponsored by the University of Oxford. Te CALM study was registered with the International Standard Randomised 
Controlled Trial Number registry (ISRCTN39463479) and the National Institute of Health Research portfolio 
(15,912). Te study sponsor was the University of Birmingham.
Histological analysis of liver biopsy samples. All biopsies were reported by at least 2 liver histopathologists for both studies34,35, and adequacy assessed using the defnition of the Royal College of Pathologists36. 
Histology was graded according to the NASH-CRN for Kleiner-Brunt Fibrosis; hepatocellular ballooning; lobular infammation; steatosis and the composite NAS. All pathologists were blinded to patient characteristics and 
non-invasive assessment data. Biopsy scores used for the analysis were those collected as part of the three independent studies and were not re-read centrally.
Magnetic resonance imaging protocol. Te LiverMultiScan MRI scanning protocol was installed, calibrated and phantom tested on all the MR systems in these trials in a standard way37. Patients underwent their 
MRI (SIEMENS MAGNETOM TrioTim, Magnetic Field Strength 3 T) having fasted for at least 4 h. Te average 
scan time for this protocol was 10 min. Te protocol included a shortened modifed look-locker inversion recov-

multi-echo spoiled-gradient-echo chemical shif encoded acquisition (DiXON_T2Star_GRE [TR 600 ms; TE 
2.46 ms, 7.38 ms, 12.3 ms, 17.22 ms, 22.14 ms; FA 20; Slice Tickness 3 mm]) to calculate T2* and PDFF maps in 
most cases, although some PDFF values were generated using in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy 
(MRS), a specialised magnetic resonance technique that measures fat by quantifying the overall volume fraction of lipids in the liver parenchyma. Four single transverse slices were captured through the liver centred on 
the porta hepatis. Anonymised MR data were analysed of-site using LiverMultiScan sofware by image analysts 
trained in abdominal anatomy and artefact detection, who were blinded to the clinical data and risk grouping. 
For T2* (measured in milliseconds, ms) and PDFF (measured in %), three 15 mm diameter circular regions of 
interest (ROIs) were selected on the transverse maps to cover a representative sample of the liver parenchyma. 
For cT1 (ms) ROIs were placed on the central slice within the typical percutaneous biopsy region. Median values 
from all pixels within the ROIs were calculated and used as the representative score. Example cT1 and PDFF 
maps acquired using the LiverMultiScan protocol are displayed in Fig. 1.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using R sofware version 3.5.338 and a p-value less 
than 0.05 was considered statistically signifcant. Case-wise deletion was employed to include only complete 
cases for NAS, Kleiner-Brunt Fibrosis score and cT1 and PDFF, ALT, AST, albumin, bilirubin, GGT, and fasting 
blood glucose scores. Descriptive statistics were used to summarise baseline participant characteristics. Mean 
and standard deviation (SD) were used to describe normally distributed continuous variables, median with 
interquartile range for non-normally distributed, and frequency and percentage for categorical variables. Mean 
diference in biomarker values between those with NAS≥4 and F≥2 on biopsy versus those without, were compared by Student t-test with common variance and Fisher’s exact test, respectively.
To discriminate patients with progressive NASH, defned as having a NAS ≥4 (in the presence of ballooning≥1 and lobular infammation≥1), with Kleiner-Brunt Fibrosis≥2, from NAFLD patients not meeting these 
criteria, univariable logistic regression analysis was performed for all the potential predictors which included 
cT1, PDFF; and the serum measures acquired as part of standard clinical care: fasting glucose, AST, GGT, ALT, 
albumin and bilirubin. Following this, stepwise logistic regression analysis was performed using Akaike information criterion39 to select the optimal combination of MRI and blood serum derived predictors (model 1). All 
potential biomarkers were normalised using the z-score (linearly transformed data values having a mean of zero 
and standard deviation of 1), to allow for a meaningful interpretation because of the diferences in the range and 
magnitude of the diferent units for all biomarkers. Risk scores were extracted from the odds ratio estimates of 
having NAS≥4 and F≥2 as calculated in the logistic regression model. Overall diagnostic accuracy produced by 
individual metrics and model 1 was estimated as the area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) with 95% CI.
Model 1 was validated using fvefold cross-validation by randomly splitting into 5 equal subsamples; 4 subsamples were used to train the model and the one lef to test the model. Tis process was repeated 5 times, so 
every subsample was used once as a test dataset. Te AUC was extracted as the mean across the 5 estimates 
from the fvefold cross-validation method. To investigate the potential efect of age and gender on discriminating patients with NAS≥4 and F≥2 from those without, model 1 was further adjusted (model 2) as a sensitivity 
analysis. Te Wald test was used40 to investigate if signifcant improvement was added to the ft of model 1, when 
age and gender were included; and DeLong’s non-parametric test41 was used to compare the overall diagnostic 
performance between nested models 1 and 2.
Results
362 biopsied patients were initially included in the dataset. Afer applying the exclusion criteria, 86 patients were 
included in the analysis (Fig. 2). Mean interval between biopsy and MRI was 66 days (SD: 86 days, range 0–311). 
39.5% of patients were classifed in the NAS≥4 and F≥2 group (Table 1). Te blood serum metrics of bilirubin, 
albumin, GGT, and ALT had similar distributions in both groups. AST and fasting glucose were signifcantly

higher in the NAS≥4 and F≥2 group (p=0.001 and p<0.0001, respectively). Te mean cT1 was signifcantly 
higher in patients classifed as NAS≥4 and F≥2 compared to those without these criteria (934 ms vs. 854 ms; 
p-value=0.0006, Table 1). PDFF did not difer signifcantly between the two groups. 
Univariate analysis of the discriminatory ability of each of the biomarkers revealed a one unit increase in 
the normalised cT1, fasting glucose, AST and GGT, signifcantly increased the odds of having NAS≥4 and F≥2 
by 2.34 (95% CI 1.42–4.15), 3.61 (95% CI 1.96–8.07), 2.49 (95% CI 1.51–4.55) and 1.53 (95% CI 1.04–2.42), 
respectively. Figure 3 illustrates the odds ratios of this univariable analysis. Stepwise multivariable logistic regression selected cT1, fasting glucose, and AST as the optimal combination to predict NAS≥4 and F≥2. Model 1 
showed that a one unit increase in the normalised cT1, fasting glucose, and AST had a signifcant increase of 
2.40 (95% CI 1.21–5.30), 4.56 (95% CI 2.34–11.67) and 3.13 (95% CI 1.62–7.20), respectively, in the odds ratio 
of having NAS≥4 and F≥2.
Te individual biomarkers cT1, AST, and fasting glucose yielded overall diagnostic performance of 0.73 
(95% CI 0.62–0.84), 0.71 (95% CI 0.6–0.82) and 0.78 (95% CI 0.68–0.88), respectively (Fig. 4), in discriminating those with NAS≥4 and F≥2. Te composite of the three biomarkers, abbreviated as the “cTAG” risk score 
(as extracted by model 1), yielded the highest diagnostic performance of 0.90 (95% CI 0.84–0.97) (Fig. 4). Te 
diagnostic accuracy and test performance characteristics (sensitivity and specifcity) for all potential cTAG 
cut-ofs are displayed in Fig. 5. Selecting a cut-of from the model to achieve at least 90% sensitivity, yielded 
34%; this gave a sensitivity of 92% and a specifcity of 79% (Table 2). Cut-ofs for the individual biomarkers in 
cTAG, that represent 90% sensitivity and 90% specifcity are available in Tables S1 and S2 in the supplementary 
material respectively.
Model 1 resulted in the following equation for the cTAG risk score of having NAS≥4 and F≥2. cT1, AST and

Sensitivity analysis: potential efect of age and gender. Model 2 showed that a one unit increase in 
the normalised age, and being male increased the odds of having NAS≥4 and F≥2 by 1.17 (95% CI 0.96–3.26) 
and 1.11 (95% CI 0.29–4.24), respectively; however, neither of these were statistically signifcant, while one unit 
increase in cT1, fasting glucose and AST, signifcantly increased the odds of having NAS≥4 and F≥2 by 2.54 
(95% CI 1.27–5.26), 3.85 (95% CI 1.98–9.69) and 3.36 (95% CI 1.67–3.85) respectively. Tere was insufcient 
evidence to suggest that adding age and gender to the cTAG score discriminates more accurately those with 
NAS≥4 and F≥2 (Wald test between nested model 1 and 2, (p=0.7690); DeLong test between the AUROC of 
the risk scores produced by models 1 and 2 (p=0.76).
Model validation. Te overall discriminative performance of model 1 in the fvefold cross-validation was 
AUROC=0.84 (95% CI 0.75–0.94) (Fig. 6).
cTAG for trial enrichment. Te potential impact of screen failure rate, defned as the proportion of individuals who pass through screening but do not meet the histological criteria of NAS≥4 and F≥2 afer biopsy, 
was explored for all potential cut-ofs (Fig. 5). In a worked example, a cTAG risk score of 34% resulted in a screen 
failure rate of 13%, compared to 61% without. Using the same cTAG cut-of, 26% of patients that received a positive result failed to meet the histological criteria (false discovery rate, is defned as 100%-PPV). Te selection of 
the optimal cut-of for trial enrichment will ultimately depend on the required balance between screen fail and 
missed cases rate.

Discussion
In this retrospective cohort study, we highlight the utility of a novel composite score, cTAG, that combines cT1, a 
non-invasive MRI-derived biomarkers of liver disease with standard serum biomarkers, to identify patients with 
progressive NASH. In line with previously-used defnitions of this high-risk NASH group42, and common enrolment criteria for NASH clinical trials (e.g. Regenerate NCT02548351; Resolve-IT NCT02704403; Maestro-Nash 
NCT03900429) we have targeted the identifcation of patients with histologically-determined NAS≥4 and F≥2.
In this study, fasting glucose, AST, GGT and the MRI biomarker cT1 each had good diagnostic performance 
to discriminate those with progressive NASH. Somewhat surprisingly given its common use as a screening tool 
and endpoint in NASH trials, PDFF demonstrated poor performance in discriminating these patient groups. 
Tis may be explained by the observed reduction in PDFF with advanced fbrosis which drops signifcantly 
afer F3 thus diverging from the positive relationship27,29. Of the imaging and serum markers evaluated, the 
optimal combination: cT1, AST and fasting glucose (cTAG), demonstrated excellent performance in identifying 
patients with NAS≥4 and F≥2 (AUROC=0.90) in this dataset, which was corroborated with cross-validation 
(AUROC=0.84). Modelling the impact of using the cTAG score to enrich the population selected for liver biopsy 
revealed a reduction in screen failure rate from 61 to 13%, corresponding to an 87% higher chance of a selected 
patient meeting the histological criteria of NAS≥4 and F≥2. Tis highlights a potential role for this composite 
biomarker in both NASH clinical trials to reduce the number of avoidable invasive liver biopsies, and in secondary clinical care to evaluate NASH status. Health economic modelling has demonstrated LiverMultiScan to be 
cost efective for the detection of patients with NASH35, a value that is likely to even greater if the full cost of liver 
biopsy, accounting for complications was considered. Further research into the cost implications of non-invasive 
biomarkers for NASH in a variety of healthcare settings is warranted.
Te utility of cT1 in distinguishing between these groups derives from the signifcantly higher cT1 in the 
progressive NASH group. To put the 79.8 ms diference in context, the reported standard deviation for cT1 
reproducibility (same patient scanned across diferent MRI scanners) is 41.4 ms37 and 31.9 ms for a longitudinal 
test–retest study over 16 weeks43. Although the data reported in this study is not longitudinal, the magnitude of 
the diference between the two risk groups, relative to the reported repeatability and reproducibility, supports 
the utility of cT1 as a sensitive biomarker for monitoring changes in disease state44. Regarding the observed 
results for the blood-based biomarkers, the usual pattern of abnormal liver enzymes due to NAFLD is increased 
transaminases, with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels exceeding those of aspartate aminotransferase (AST). 
As NAFLD progresses to NASH and fbrosis the AST may increase and lead to a resultant rise in the ratio of 
AST/ALT45,46; the γ glutamyl-transferase (GGT) level can also increase. Although ALT and AST are useful tests, 
they are not reliable in predicting NAFLD. It has been found that up to 50% of NAFLD patients can have normal levels of AST and ALT47,48. Similarly, insulin resistance is a factor associated with NASH49, HOMA-IA for 
example has been identifed as an independent predictor of advanced fbrosis in patients with NAFLD50 and the 
prevalence of NAFLD is estimated to be 60% in patients with type 2 diabetes1,2
. Te liver is also the main location of glucose production during fasting conditions thus fasting glucose a good marker of insulin resistance. 
Patients with hepatic steatosis may have increased fasting glucose51 but not always. Tese fuctuating patterns of 
the biomarkers in NASH highlight the added potential of augmenting the information available by combining

variables were normalised (with z-scores).

imaging and circulating biomarkers to build a more accurate profle of underlying liver disease, an area that 
is rapidly evolving as evidenced by the wealth of emerging research into combined biomarkers (e.g. FAST42, 
ADAPT52). Te promise of such approaches may not only match the prognostic performance of liver biopsy but 
likely one day surpass it by forming a basis for precision medicine.
Whilst the results of this analysis are very promising, the research is not without its limitations. Te role of a 
single fasting glucose measurement to act as a predictor of NAS≥4 and F≥2 can be an inferior predictor compared 
to some other indicator of glycaemic control such as HbA1c, HOMA-IA, previous diagnosis of diabetes or current 
usage of antidiabetic medications, but none of these were consistently collected in the analysed dataset. Fasting 
glucose varies afer meals, exercising or antidiabetic medications and this whilst it is common for glucose measurements to be assumed fasting, they may in fact refect recent food intake, which can introduce bias. However, other

studies suggested that fasting glucose is higher in patients with NASH, highlighting the potential use as a predictor 
of coexisting diabetes and NASH51,53. Another consideration that should be noted in studies of this nature is the 
potential for discordance with biopsy results as a result of a large time interval between measurements. Te mean 
time interval for this study was 66 days, in which one would not expect any major change in the health of the liver 
in the absence of pharmaceutical intervention; however, in some cases the interval was up to 10 months. Whilst 
fbrosis has been reported to take up to 7 years to progress54, these intervals may infuence the interpretability of 
the data in this cohort. Further validation studies should aim to minimise this interval where possible. It should 
also be noted that the sample size analysed in this study was relatively small, and future studies with larger datasets 
are required to independently validate the diagnostic performance of the model.
Conclusion
While the individual biomarkers of cT1, fasting glucose and AST yielded good discriminatory performance in 
identifying progressive NASH, a composite of all three, the cTAG score, greatly improved the performance. Te 
non-invasive, objective and organ-specifc nature of cT1 compliments these routinely measured blood analytes. 
Together, this highlights the potential utility of cTAG in identifying patients at increased risk of disease progression who would be suitable for pharmacological therapy, either as part of a clinical trial or in routine clinical 
practice as treatments become available. Further research, possible exploring more stable and accurate markers 
of insulin resistance, are warranted in order to validate the model in independent cohorts with larger sample 
sizes and varying disease prevalence.
