Abstract The introduction of imatinib to clinical practice
revolutionized therapy of advanced gastrointestinal stromal
tumors (GIST), but its long-term results have been only just
collected. We have attempted to identify factors related to
the long-term survival. We have analyzed the data of 430
inoperable/metastatic/recurrent GIST patients treated with
imatinib in reference centers, assessed the factors influencing the long-term overall survival (OS), and compared
the outcomes in three periods of initiation of imatinib
therapy during one decade (2001–2003, 2004–2006,
2007–2010). During analyzed time periods, we have found
decrease in median largest tumor size at the start of
imatinib therapy: 90.5 mm (2001–2003) versus 74 mm
(2004–2006) versus 58 mm (2007–2010) (p = 0.002).
Median progression-free survival (PFS) on 1st line imatinib
was 37.5 months, without differences in PFS between three
groups. Median OS was 5.8 years, 8-year OS rate was
43 %, and no difference in OS was demonstrated for
patients treated in analyzed time periods. Independent good
prognostic factors for longer OS were as follows: surgery
of residual disease, initial WHO performance status 0/1,
normal baseline albumin level, and the presence of exon 11
KIT mutations. Current median OS in advanced GIST
reaches 6 years. The long-term survivors were characterized by smaller maximal tumors at imatinib start, better
blood tests results, better performance status, and the surgical removal of residual disease. The latter might reduce
the impact of tumor size and equalize the long-term results
of therapy during last decade from introduction of imatinib.

Introduction
The introduction of imatinib to therapy of advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) has dramatically
improved the outcomes of these tumors [1, 2]. Imatinib as
tyrosine kinase inhibitor inhibiting KIT/PDGFRA (plateletderived growth factor receptor alpha) and their downstream
signaling cascade in GIST cells is currently standard of
care in the first-line therapy of inoperable and/or metastatic
tumors [3], and became the model of targeted therapy of
solid tumors. Its efficacy has been also proven recently in
adjuvant setting after resection of primary high-risk tumors
[4, 5]. However, a majority of patients eventually develop
clinical resistance to imatinib. Over the last few years,
major progress has been made in elucidating the mechanism of disease progression and resistance to imatinib such
as secondary mutations in KIT and/or PDGFRA kinase
domains. Currently, the sole-approved second-line drug is
sunitinib—a multi-targeted agent [6]. Moreover, a number
of new generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (as regorafenib, registered recently in USA), alone or in combination,
are being evaluated at present alongside treatment options
alternative to inhibiting the KIT signaling pathway [7].
There are limited data regarding the long-term outcomes
of metastatic GIST outside the clinical trials in routine
practice. The aim of this large contemporary series of
inoperable/metastatic GIST was to identify factors related
to progression-free and overall survival (OS) of patients
starting imatinib therapy as well as to attempt to identify
the factors related to subgroup of patients with the longterm survival.
Patients and methods
Patients
In this observational study, we analyzed collected prospectively data of 430 consecutive patients treated initially
with imatinib mesylate (according to approved registration)
due to inoperable and/or metastatic histologically confirmed, CD117-positive GIST, who were treated or referred
to tertiary sarcoma center within framework of the Polish
Clinical GIST Registry between September 1, 2001 and
December 31, 2010. Each patient provided informed
consent for the study. The study has been approved by the
local Bio-Ethics Committee according to Good Clinical
Practice Guidelines. Patients did not undergo any further
selection. The distribution of clinical and pathological data
of patients included in the study is listed in Table 1. There
were 226 male and 204 female patients, with median age at
the start of imatinib therapy 58 years (range 15–89).
All but eight patients (who started imatinib therapy from
800 mg/day) were treated with imatinib in initial dose of
400 mg daily. All patients were followed carefully with
median follow-up time for survivors of 51 months. The
objective response of GIST to imatinib therapy was evaluated with serial CT examinations (performed every
2–3 months), according to Response Evaluation Criteria in
Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0 [8]. In doubtful cases
of progressive disease, additional Choi’s criteria were
applied [9]. In the case of progression or unacceptable
toxicity (three cases), patients were treated with imatinib at
the higher doses (600–800 mg daily) or the therapy was
immediately changed to sunitinib. One hundred and eightyeight progressing patients were thereafter treated with
sunitinib (since 2005). Subsequently, patients were treated
according to decision of treating physician with either best
supportive care, experimental therapy (nilotinib or regorafenib), off-label use of sorafenib, reintroduction of
imatinib, or chemotherapy.
Multidisciplinary team evaluated possibility of surgical
treatment of residual lesions (liver and/or intraperitoneal
metastases), which had been estimated as resectable after
maximal response to imatinib (as described previously)
[10].
Genomic screening was performed for the presence of
the KIT (exons 9, 11, 13, and 17) or PDGFRA (exons 12,
14, and 18) genes mutation in randomly selected 220 cases,
based on DNA isolated from paraffin-embedded or freshfrozen imatinib-naive tumor tissues, as previously described [11].
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using R 2.10.1
statistical program.1 For the survival analysis, the Kaplan–
Meier estimator was used with the log-rank tests for
bivariate comparisons. The primary objective of the study
was to assess the OS of advanced GIST treated initially
with imatinib as well as to identify the factors related to
longer OS time. The secondary objectives were to estimate
progression-free survival (PFS) on imatinib therapy and to
describe the factors related to improved PFS time. OS time
was calculated from the date of the start of imatinib
treatment to the date of the most recent follow-up or death.

PFS time was calculated from the date of the start of
imatinib treatment to the date of the most recent follow-up,
or progression or death due to the disease. The survival was
assessed with respect to the following variables: demographic data (age at the start of imatinib therapy B40 or
[40 years; gender), the period of initiation of imatinib
therapy (2001–2003 vs. 2004–206 vs. 2007–2010), primary
tumor genotype (KIT exon 11, KIT exon 9, PDGFRA exon
18 D842V mutations, wild type, and other cases), the
maximal diameter of the largest tumor at imatinib start, the
presence versus absence of liver metastases, primary tumor
site (gastric vs. duodenum vs. small bowel—ileum or
jejunum vs. large bowel vs. other or intraperitoneally with
unknown primary origin), baseline (1–7 days before start
of imatinib therapy) albumin level (low\35 g/l vs. normal
[35 g/l), baseline (1–7 days before start of imatinib therapy) hemoglobin level (low \11 g/100 ml or normal
C11 g/100 ml), baseline (1–7 days before start of imatinib
therapy) neutrophils count (high [5 9 109
/l vs. normal
\5 9 109
/l), baseline (1–7 days before start of imatinib
therapy) performance status according to World Health
Organization (WHO) (good: 0–1 vs. poor C2), and the fact
of resection of GIST residual disease during imatinib
therapy. In multivariate analysis of the factors associated
with PFS, we used Cox proportional hazards models,
applying the stepwise model building procedure that
included all covariates significant at 20 % level in bivariate
analysis. The best model was based on Akaike’s criterion.
The differences were considered statistically significant if
the p values were \0.05.

11 KIT, 13 %—exon 9 KIT, 4.1 %—exon 18 PDGFRA
D842V, and 4.1 %—other types of mutation).
Progression-free survival on imatinib therapy
Progression of disease during imatinib therapy was
observed in 246 cases (57 %). Median PFS was
37.5 months, and estimated 5- and 8-year PFS rates were
37.0 and 27 %, respectively.
We have not observed significant differences in PFS
between three analyzed periods of time (Fig. 1).
In univariate analysis, the following factors correlated
with shorter PFS (Table 2a): lack of resection of residual
disease during imatinib therapy, primary tumor located in
duodenum or intraperitoneally with unknown primary origin, the maximal tumor diameter of the largest tumor
[100 mm, tumor mutation other than KIT exon 11, the
younger age, low baseline albumin level, high baseline
neutrophils count, low baseline hemoglobin level, and poor
performance status.
In the multivariate analysis (final Cox model), we
identified the following independent predictive factors,
which correlated with poorer PFS (Table 3a): worse
baseline WHO performance status, high baseline neutrocyte count, low baseline hemoglobin level, younger age,
the lack of resection of residual disease, primary tumor site,
and tumor mutation other than KIT exon 11.
Overall survival
At the time of analysis, 241 (56 %) patients were alive.
Median OS was 37.5 months, and estimated 5- and 8-year
PFS rates were 57 and 47 %, respectively (Fig. 2a).
We have not observed significant differences in OS
between three analyzed periods of time (data not shown).
The following factors significantly influenced OS in
bivariate analysis (Table 2b): poor baseline WHO performance status C2, baseline high neutrocyte count, baseline
low albumin level, low baseline hemoglobin level, the
maximal diameter of the largest tumor [10 cm (Fig. 2b),
and the lack of resection of residual disease during imatinib
therapy (Fig. 2c). Patients with primary tumors carrying
mutation D842V in exon 18 PDGFRA had substantially
shorter OS reaching median OS only 15.5 months
(Fig. 2d).
The following factors were found to be independent
predictors of better OS according to multivariate analysis
(Table 3b): good baseline WHO performance status, normal baseline albumin level, the resection of residual disease during imatinib therapy, the presence of exon 11 KIT
mutations, and (with borderline significance) the maximal
tumor diameter of the largest tumor [10 cm.
Discussion
Our data comprise the largest series of advanced GIST
patients treated in routine practice and were collected
prospectively in tumor-type-specific national registry with
the long follow-up. Several conducted clinical trials confirmed high efficacy of imatinib in the treatment of inoperable/metastatic GIST [1, 2, 12, 13] as compared to
historical clinical data with median survival of patients
being 10–19 months [3, 14], with the current survival being
strikingly superior [15]. The median OS reported until now
in few studies reached only from 4.0 to 6.4 years [12, 13,
16–21]. Our data confirm this superior survival. Moreover,
although the spectacular response to imatinib therapy is
time-limited and followed by the development of secondary resistance (after initial stabilization or response) in the
majority of patients, still 1/4 of patients have not been
progressing at 8 years of therapy with imatinib. The current
PFS in our series on first-line therapy with imatinib is
approximately 3 years, what is almost the same as in the
recent Taiwanese one-institution study [20], and it did not
improve significantly over decade from the turning point of
introduction of imatinib to clinical practice. However, we
have found systematically decrease in maximal tumor
burden during this period of time, what is probably related
to better follow-up of patients after resection of primary
tumor and earlier detection of recurrent disease. The cutoff value for tumor bulk which had significantly inferior
impact on PFS and OS was 10 cm in our series defined as
the single largest size of measurable lesions. It confirms the
previous data that largest tumor may be related to higher
likelihood of development of resistant clones and secondary mutations [13, 20, 22–25], and it underlines the utility
of tumor bulk assessment by the single largest lesion.

We have previously identified some predictive factors
for the benefit of imatinib therapy in terms of inhibition of
disease progression in advanced GIST [26]. Also, van
Glabbeke and co-authors [27] had reported data on distinctive predictive clinicopathological factors for initial and
late resistance to imatinib in advanced GISTs, but this
analysis did not include the genotyping of the tumor as well
as the strategy of removal of residual disease during therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Currently, we have
expanded the variables predictive for the long-term outcomes and survival of inoperable and/or metastatic GISTs
treated initially with imatinib. Based on these results of
univariate and multivariate analyses, we can identify the
patients’ factors which are related to benefits of longer
survival: initial better performance status and laboratory
test results (especially normal albumin level), primary
tumor genotype (exon 11 KIT mutants and genotype other
than exon 18 PDGFRA D842V), the smaller maximal size
of the largest tumor, and resection of residual disease
during imatinib therapy. These factors may account for the
basis for development of the nomogram for PFS and OS
[28]. Laboratory factors as high granulocyte count, low
hemoglobin level, or low albumin level together with poor
general performance status were previously implied as
predictive factors for resistance to imatinib therapy [12, 13,
17, 18, 23, 26, 27]. Consistently with the results of present
series, these factors can be related to generally more
advanced and aggressive tumors, with higher inflammatory
component influencing pharmacokinetics of the drug [13,
17, 27, 29, 30].
In patients with available data on tumor genotype, we
found consistently with results already reported [12, 31–
34] that the mutational status had significant impact on
prognosis, with the best results for KIT exon 11 mutants in
terms of PFS and OS. For OS, the effect of presence of KIT
exon 11 as compared to KIT exon 9 mutations was less
evident, which may be related to the impact of subsequent
lines of therapy (mainly with sunitinib, which is more
active for KIT exon 9 mutants [35]. Notably, according to
Blanke et al. [13], the effect of exon 11 KIT mutations on
OS mainly resulted from their strong effect during the first
30 months of treatment. We could not analyze the influence of higher dose of imatinib on PFS in subgroup of
patients with KIT exon 9 mutations because all but eight
patients started therapy from registered dose of 400 mg.
The available data (from EORTC-ISG-AGITG 62005 trial
Fig. 2 Overall survival: in the entire group of patients (a); according to maximal diameter of tumor at start of imatinib therapy in mm (b);
according to the lack of resection of residual disease during imatinib therapy (c); and according to initial mutational status (d)

and meta-analysis with S0033) have shown that the
response of patients with exon 9 KIT mutations depends on
the dose of the drug and that these patients under higher
does (800 mg daily) of imatinib demonstrate significant
improvement of PFS as compared to a standard dose of
400 mg daily (without impact on OS) [17, 36]. Furthermore, although the presence of PDGFRA D842V mutation
is related to more indolent disease in primary resectable
GIST [37], it is poor prognostic factor in advanced disease,
as this mutation is insensitive to commonly used tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (including imatinib and sunitinib) [33, 38]
and is responsible for primary resistance to imatinib.
Surgery of residual disease in situation of absence of
disease progression was found as the most independent
prognostic factor for better outcomes in advanced GIST.
Some studies have already reported favorable outcomes of
surgery in responding patients [10, 39–42]. The present
series demonstrate clear improvement in the long-term
term survival in the group of patients operated after
response to imatinib therapy (median PFS and OS were not
reached). Although we cannot exclude selection bias as the
role of surgery in metastatic GIST has never been confirmed in prospective study (as the initiated studies failed
because of slow recruitment) [43], we still believe in real
impact of this strategy on natural course of the disease. It
can theoretically prolong durable remission, because the
excision of the tumor is performed before the development
of imatinib resistance, and thus, the risk of resistant clone
selection is reduced. We have rather liberally used surgical
removal of residual disease after individual decision made
on multidisciplinary tumor board, as more than 20 %
patients responding to systemic therapy underwent surgery
following imatinib therapy, what might reduce the impact
of initial tumor size at advanced setting.
Although imatinib is the most important therapy in
GIST, predominantly influencing survival in advanced
disease, the difference between median PFS and OS on
initial therapy with imatinib in our study is more than
2.5 years. There are several reasons for these results, suggesting relative efficacy of salvage therapy after imatinib
failure. Multidisciplinary approach after progression on
initial dose of imatinib includes increase of the dose of
imatinib to 800 mg daily [44], surgical resection, or ablation of focally progressive disease [10, 39, 42], using
therapy with alternative receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(as second-line registered multi-targeted tyrosine inhibitor
sunitinib, or further line therapy with sorafenib or regorafenib, which recently has been approved in USA) [7, 45].
We have recently analyzed the results of sunitinib therapy
in series of 137 patients after failure of imatinib therapy and
demonstrated survival exceeding 1.5 years from start of
sunitinib [36], as well as we have also proven that contrary
to imatinib, tumors initially (pre-imatinib treatment)
bearing KIT exon 9 mutation or with wild-type genotype
have a higher chance to respond to sunitinib. We also
actively used therapy with alternative tyrosine kinase
inhibitors after progression on imatinib and sunitinib (not
only best supportive care), which also may be related to
better OS observed in our study [46] and lack of differences
between different periods of treatment.
To summarize, the current median survival in advanced
GIST reaches 6 years. The long-term survivors (with OS
exceeding 5 years) were characterized by smaller maximal
tumors at start of imatinib therapy, better laboratory tests
results, better performance status, and more commonly use
of surgical removal of residual disease. The latter might
reduce the impact of tumor size and equalize the long-term
results of therapy during last decade from the introduction
of imatinib. In addition, after introduction of subsequent
lines of therapy, the effect of primary mutational status
(with exception of PDGFRA-D842V) on long-term OS is
less visible.
