Abstract
Purpose: To evaluate the spectrum of celiac axis, common hepatic artery (CHA), right, left, middle hepatic artery and gastroduodenal 
artery variations by using spiral computed tomography (CT). Materials and Methods: A retrospective review of Multidetector 
CT (MDCT) abdominal angiography scans was performed in patients sent for various liver and other abdominal pathologies between 
January 2012 and February 2013. A total of 600 patients were evaluated. Defi nitions of CHA, ambiguous celiac axis, course and 
division patterns of CHA, replaced hepatic artery, accessory hepatic artery and middle hepatic artery were used as proposed by 
Song et al., Covey et al., and Wang et al. The pattern of the aortic origin of branches of celiac axis, common hepatic artery and 
its branches was analyzed. Results: Six types of celiac axis anatomic variations were identifi ed in our study. A total of 546 of the 
600 patients had a normal celiac axis anatomy. Anatomic variations were seen in 5.5% of patients. Ambiguous anatomy was seen 
in 3.5% of the patients. CHA originated from celiac axis in 95.83% of the patients. Variations in anatomic origin of CHA were seen in 
8 patients. Ambiguous dual pathway was seen in 4 patients. Normal Sp-preportal course of CHA was identifi ed in 97.78% of cases, 
Sp-retroportal course in 7 patients, Tp-preportal course in 2, Tp-retroportal in 1, Ip-preportal in 1 and through Ligamentum venosum 
in 2 patients. Normal origin of RHA from HAP was seen in 79.6% patients. Replaced origin of RHA was seen in 15.16% cases and 
Accessory origin of RHA was seen in 5.16% cases. LHA originated from HAP in 81.5% patients. Replaced LHA origin was seen in 
10.8% cases and Accessory LHA origin seen in 7.6% cases. MHA originated from RHA in 41.3% patients, LHA in 27.83% and from 
CHA in 4.5% cases. Origin of MHA could not be defi ned in 26.3% of patients. GDA originated from CHA in 97.6% of patients, from 
celiac axis in 1.6%, from RHA in 0.33% in patients. Trifurcation of CHA was seen in 7.16% and quadrifurcation of CHA in 2.16%. 
Conclusion: CT Angiography is a safe and highly sensitive and accurate modality for evaluation of arterial anatomy and its variants.

Introduction
The importance of celiac axis, common hepatic artery 
variations, and origin of middle hepatic artery has been 
an area of great interest and research since 1756 when 
Haller fi rst described celiac axis variations. In 1955, Michel 
described the classifi cation scheme for describing anatomic 
variation in the hepatic arterial blood supply based on 
the results of dissecting 200 cadavers [Table 1].[1] In 1969, 
Vandamme et al., did extensive research on hepatic artery 
anomalies on 156 cadavers.[2] Then, in 1971, Suzuki et al.,
published their series on 200 patients based on angiography 
study and also highlighted the importance of hepatic artery 
variations.[3] In 2010, Song et al., published the largest series 
of their work in celiac axis and hepatic artery variations in 
5002 patients.[4]
Recently, with the advent of newer interventional and 
surgical options for patients with primary and metastatic

hepatic malignancies, partial hepatectomy for liver 
transplantation and laparoscopic cholecystectomy, 
surgeons and interventional radiologists are now relying 
on accurate imaging and assessment of the hepatic 
arterial supply. A road map of the arterial vascularity of 
the donor and recipient is a prerequisite for transplant 
surgery [Table 2].[5] Detailed hepatic arterial anatomy and 
its variations has its signifi cance in liver surgeries and 
interventional hepatic procedures, relative to the hepatic 
lobe involved [Table 3].[5]
The purpose of this study was to study the anatomic 
variations in the origin and course of celiac axis, common 
hepatic artery and its branches – right, left , middle hepatic, 
and gastroduodenal arteries.
Materials and Methods
Patients
Approval for the study was obtained from the ethical board 
of the Institution. Multidetector CT (MDCT) abdominal 
angiography scans were obtained in patients sent for various 
liver and other abdominal pathologies in which biphasic 
contrast-enhanced CT was indicated. The time period of the 
study was from January 2012 to February 2013. A total of 
600 patients were evaluated. The study population comprised 
413 men and 187 women (mean age 39.8 years). We excluded 
patients with a history of major upper abdominal surgery.
CT examination protocol
MDCT angiography was performed on Philips Brilliance 
40-slice aft er injecting maximum of 120 mL of nonionic 
iodinated contrast material (iodine concentration, 
370 mg/mL) through an 18-20-gauge antecubital intravenous 
cannula at a rate of 5-7 mL/sec. The detailed multidetector 
CT angiography technique is summarized in Table 4.
Image interpretation
The raw imaging data obtained from MDCT were processed 
on a commercially available workstation for multiplanar 
reformation as well as 3D reconstruction with maximum 
intensity projection (MIP) and volume rendering. The 
images were analyzed independently by three radiologists 
Radiologist 1 (B.S.) with 5 years, Radiologist 2 (M.S.) 
with 20 years and Radiologist 3 (M.K.M) with 24 years of 
experience in interpreting CT scans. The abbreviations used 
in this study are listed in Table 5. We analyzed the celiac axis 
anatomy and origin of the four major arteries – the common 
hepatic, splenic, left gastric, and superior mesenteric arteries. 
We also studied the origin of right hepatic artery (RHA), left 
hepatic artery (LHA), middle hepatic artery (MHA), and 
gastroduodenal artery (GDA). The course and relationship 
of common hepatic artery (CHA) to the surrounding 
structures (portal vein, pancreas head, or uncinate process) 
was also analyzed. We used some key defi nitions described 
by various authors for evaluating these arteries.

Results
Celiac axis variations
A total of 546 (91%) of the 600 patients had a normal celiac 
axis anatomy, i.e. hepatogastrosplenic trunk and SMA 
originating separately from the aorta. Six types of celiac axis 
anatomic variations were identifi ed in our study [Table 6]. 
These were seen in 33 (5.5%) of the patients. Ambiguous 
anatomy was seen in 21 (3.5%) patients.
CHA variations
CHA originated from the celiac axis in 575 (95.83%) of the 
patients. Variations in anatomic origin of CHA were seen 
in eight patients (origin from SMA in six and from aorta in 
two patients). Ambiguous dual pathway (hepatomesenteric 
trunk) was seen in 4 (0.66%) patients. The origin of CHA 
could not be determined in 13 (2.16%) of the patients.
Normal suprapancreatic (Sp)-preportal course of CHA was 
identifi ed in 576 (98.12%) of the cases. Sp-retroportal course 
was seen in seven patients, transpancreatic (Tp)-retroportal

ligamentum venosum in two patients. Detailed fi ndings of 
CHA variations are summarized in Table 7.
RHA, LHA, MHA, and GDA variations
Normal origin of RHA from hepatic artery proper (HAP) 
was seen in 478 (79.6%) patients. Replaced origin of RHA was 
seen in 91 (15.16%) cases and accessory origin of RHA was 
seen in 31 (5.16%) cases. LHA originated from HAP in 
489 (81.5%) patients. Replaced LHA origin was seen in 
65 (10.8%) cases and accessory LHA origin seen in 46 (7.6%) 
cases. MHA originated from RHA in 248 (41.33%) patients, 
from LHA in 167 (27.83%), and from CHA in 27 (4.5%) cases. 
Origin of MHA could not be defi ned in 158 (26.3%) of the 
patients. GDA originated from CHA in 586 (97.6%) of the 
patients, from celiac axis in 10 (1.6%), and from RHA in 
2 (0.33%) patients. Origin of GDA could not be determined 
in two cases. Detailed anatomic variations of RHA, LHA, 
MHA, and GDA are summarized in Table 8.
Other variations
Trifurcation of CHA was seen in 43 (7.16%) and 
quadrifurcation of CHA in 13 (2.16%) of the patients. Early 
branching of RHA was seen in 5 (0.83%) and early branching 
of LHA in 3 (0.5%) of the patients. Double hepatic arteries 
were seen in 14 (2.33%) patients. Late origin of GDA was 
seen in two patients.
Discussion
By using clear definitions pertaining to the origin and 
course of these vessels as already mentioned, we performed 
systematic analysis of CT angiography images and were able 
to identify and classify the comprehensive spectrum of celiac 
axis, CHA, RHA, LHA, MHA, and GDA variations, including 
their variant origins and 3D anatomic courses. According to 
Tandler et al.,
[8] four primitive ventral branches arise from the 
abdominal aorta that are interconnected by an anastomotic 
channel during embryogenesis. It is the persistent overgrowth 
or regression of these primitive vascular channels which leads 
to the development of variations of the celiac axis and the SMA. 
On the basis of this hypothesis, 15 types of celiac axis variation 
are possible.[9] Six of these 15 types were found in this study. 
According to Michels, the prevalence of a normal celiac axis 
anatomy is 89%. In our study, normal celiac axis anatomy was 
seen in 91% [Figure 1]. The most common anatomic variation 
was of hepatosplenic trunk with separately originating left 
gastric artery (LGA) and SMA (2.83%) [Figure 2]. This result 
was consistent with the results obtained by Song et al.
[4] The 
next common anatomic variation in our study was that 
of gastrosplenic trunk with separate origins of CHA and 
SMA (0.83%) [Figure 3], followed by that of gastrosplenic 
trunk and a common hepatomesenteric trunk. This variation 
was seen more frequently in our study as compared to that 
observed by Song et al.
[4] Ambiguous celiac axis anatomy 
was identified in 21 (3.5%) of the patients. Ambiguous 
anatomy due to persistent anastomotic channel was seen 
in 8 patients [Figure 4] and due to absent CHA was seen in 
13 patients [Figure 5]. This persistent anatomic channel is also 
known as the Arc of Buehler. The Arc of Buehler is a remnant 
of a ventral anastomosis that interconnects embryonic ventral 
segmental arteries.[8,10,11]
Normal CHA origin was seen in 575 (95.83%) of the 
cases. Normal Sp-preportal course of CHA was seen in 
576 (98.12%) patients. The SMA has been known as the 
most common origin site of a variant CHA. In our study

also, we found similar fi ndings with six cases of CHA 
arising from the SMA. CHA, aft er arising from the SMA, 
has three levels of pathways relative to the pancreatic 
head and the uncinate process – supra-, trans-, and 
infrapancreatic courses – as described by Song et al. The 
Sp-retroportal course was the most common type of variant

CHA that arose from the SMA. In our study, four cases of 
CHA arising from the SMA had Sp-retroportal course, one 
case had Tp-retroportal course [Figure 6], and one had 
Ip-preportal course. A separate origin of the CHA from the 
aorta is a rare variation, and the prevalence of this variation 
in our study was only 0.33%. The reported prevalences of 
this anomaly in two previous dissection studies were 0.2% 
and 0.7%, respectively.[12,13]
RHA origin from HAP was seen in 478 (79.6%) patients. 
Replaced origin of RHA was seen in 91 (15.16%) of the cases. 
The most common site of origin of replaced RHA was from 
SMA (13.49%) [Figure 7] followed by celiac axis (1.33%) and 
aorta (0.33%) [Figure 8]. Accessory origin of RHA was seen 
in 31 (5.16%) of the cases. The most common site of origin 
of accessory RHA was from the SMA followed by celiac 
axis and aorta [Figure 9]. LHA origin from HAP was seen 
in 489 (81.5%) patients. Replace origin of LHA was seen 
in 10.8% cases, with the most common site being from the 
LGA (10.46%) followed by aorta (0.33%). Accessory origin of 
LHA was seen in 7.6% cases, with all of them arising from the 
LGA in our study. In our study, all replaced and accessory 
RHA had retroportal course and replaced/accessory LHA 
had course through the ligamentum venosum.
Origin and course of MHA has not been given much 
importance in many textbooks of anatomy or surgery. 
However, MHA origin has relevance in liver transplant 
surgery while evaluating liver donors. Michels[14]
characterized the MHA as an artery in the umbilical fossa that 
supplies hepatic segment 4. In our study, MHA originated 
from RHA in 248 (41.33%) patients [Figure 10], from LHA in 
167 (27.83%) [Figure 11], and from CHA in 27 (4.5%) cases. 
MHA could not be defi ned in 158 (26.3%) cases. There was no 
instance of MHA originating from an accessory hepatic artery 
in our study. Interestingly, in almost all the cases in which 
replaced LHA origin from LGA was seen, MHA originated 
from the RHA, and in cases in which replaced RHA origin 
from SMA or celiac axis was identifi ed, MHA originated from 
the LHA. Five types of MHA have been defi ned according 
to Wang et al., which are as follows:[7]
• Type I MHA: Origin from RHA in patients with a normal 
hepatic arterial confi guration
• Type II MHA: Origin from LHA in patients with a 
normal hepatic arterial confi guration
• Type III MHA: Origin from RHA in the presence of a 
replaced LHA
• Type IV MHA: Origin from LHA in the presence of a 
replaced RHA
• Type V MHA: Origin from CHA, HAP, and the right 
anterior hepatic artery (RAHA)
Normal origin of GDA was seen in 586 (97.6%) of the cases. 
In 10 cases, GDA origin was directly from the celiac axis and 
in 2 cases, the origin was from RHA [Figure 12]. GDA was

not defi ned in two cases. Late origin of GDA was seen in 
two cases. Double hepatic artery is diff erentiated from late 
origin of the GDA by the presence of a CHA. In the case of 
a double hepatic artery, there is no CHA and the GDA may 
originate from either hepatic artery. In case of a distal origin 
of the GDA, GDA originates from one hepatic artery aft er 
the division of the CHA into the RHA and LHA.
In our study, double hepatic arteries were seen in 
14 patients, trifurcation of CHA [Figure 13] was seen in

43 (7.16%), and quadrifurcation of CHA in 13 (2.16%) 
of the patients [Figure 14]. Early branching of RHA 
[Figures 15 and 16] was seen in 5 (0.83%) and early 
branching of LHA in 3 (0.5%) of the patients [Figure 17]. The 
importance of these anatomic variations has its relevance in 
advanced intervention procedures like transcatheter arterial 
chemoembolization (TACE), transarterial radionuclide 
therapy (TART), and placement of infusion pumps. When 
placed surgically, these catheters are typically placed in 
the GDA in a retrograde direction with the catheter tip 
in the proximal GDA or in the HAP. The GDA distal to 
the catheter insertion site and the right gastric artery and 
branches supplying blood to the stomach and duodenum 
are ligated to prevent nontarget infusion.[15] In this position, 
the catheter perfuses the RHA and LHA in a patient 
with standard anatomy. When placed percutaneously, 
catheters are typically positioned in the HAP to infuse both 
hepatic arteries. In cases of a double hepatic artery and 
trifurcation or quadrifurcation of the CHA, an alternate 
catheter position or more than one catheter must be 
considered preoperatively to ensure adequate tumor 
perfusion.[15,16]
There are three main types of liver transplantation: 
cadaveric, live donor liver transplantation, and split-liver 
graft ing. The right lobe of liver is resected and the left lobe 
left behind in living adult donors, while in children, the 
left lobe is resected. The incision for hemihepatectomy 
plane is close to Cantlie line, which is a relatively avascular 
plane running 1 cm to the right of the middle hepatic

vein connecting the gall bladder and the inferior vena 
cava. Hepatic arterial variants that need extra caution, in 
liver transplant donors, include the MHA arising from 
the RHA, as the hepatectomy plane would cut this artery, 
trifurcation of CHA, and early branching of RHA/LHA 
as ligation of the CHA can cause gastric or duodenal 
hypoperfusion. Similarly, arterial variants relevant for 
transplant recipients are short RHA, celiac artery stenosis, 
replaced or accessory LHA, and replaced hepatic trunk 
arising from the SMA, as these variations increase the 
complexity during the surgery. Since the entire native 
liver is resected in the recipient, MHA variants are not of 
signifi cance for these patients. Excessive manipulation 
of RHA during surgery, which occurs usually due to its 
anomalous course, can result in biliary complications 
like stricture and cholangitis, ultimately leading to graft 
failure. This can be prevented with accurate preoperative 
knowledge of the arterial anatomy. In patients with normal 
arterial anatomy, the chemotherapy pump is placed in 
the hepatic artery aft er the origin of the gastroduodenal 
artery to avoid turbulence within the hepatic artery and 
maintain long-term patency. Adequate assessment of the 
arterial anatomy prior to placement of the infusion pumps 
reduces the chances of complications like extrahepatic 
misperfusion and chemotoxicity, chemical cholangitis, 
bleeding, and duodenitis.
Ishigami et al.,[17] studied the signifi cance of variant hepatic 
artery anatomy in liver transplant recipient patients and 
found that a small-caliber CHA oft en coexists with variant 
hepatic artery anatomy. Diameter of the CHA was measured 
near the origin of the GDA. The diameter of CHA was 
smaller in patients (mean 5.8 mm) with variant hepatic 
artery anatomy compared to those with classic hepatic 
artery anatomy (mean 6.3 mm). They concluded that 
variant hepatic artery anatomy in a liver transplant recipient 
increases the risk of post-transplantation hepatic artery 
complications like stenosis and thrombosis due to coexisting 
small caliber of CHA in these patients. Such patients can 
benefi t from meticulous preoperative evaluation of the 
arterial anatomy and careful surgical planning. Accessory 
hepatic artery is less likely to increase the risk of such 
complications than a completely replaced hepatic artery 
because the caliber of the CHA is usually normal in cases 
of accessory hepatic artery.
Arterial anatomy of the celiac axis and SMA is of great 
value in pancreatic and hepatobiliary surgeries as direct 
visualization of the surgical field is limited during 
surgeries, especially in obese and patients with prior 
history of surgery. Thus, preoperative knowledge of 
anatomic variations would help surgeons to avoid extensive 
dissection and vascular damage. Identifi cation of a replaced 
RHA is important as it usually courses posterior to the 
portal vein, and knowledge of such anatomy prevents 
complications such as bleeding during surgery. In surgeries

of fi ne arterial networks could have been missed and was 
beyond the capability of CT examination. Second, the new 
nomenclature system described by Song et al., Covey et al., 
and Wang et al., has not been assessed on the interventional 
and surgical procedures by us. However, we have tried to 
describe detailed 3D anatomy of the variations observed 
by us.
This study is the fi rst of its kind which comprehensively 
describes variations of celiac axis and hepatic artery 
branches. In today’s scenario, the role of MDCT angiography 
in preoperative evaluation of patients undergoing 
hepatobiliary surgeries and advanced interventional 
procedures cannot be underestimated in order to avoid 
life-threatening complications.

for malignancies of head/uncinate process of the pancreas, 
information on the presence or absence of a replaced RHA 
is critical. Since these patients are jaundiced, utmost care 
needs to be taken to preserve this artery if it is not involved, 
as hepatic necrosis is more common in these patients if the 
arterial fl ow is also compromised.[18] Anomalous origin of 
RHA from the celiac axis or aorta is more prone to iatrogenic 
injury. An accessory LHA needs to be ligated separately 
in surgeries where blood supply in the porta hepatis is 
occluded. Anomalous course of CHA should be mentioned 
in pancreatico-duodenal surgeries as it may be inadvertently 
injured during resection.
