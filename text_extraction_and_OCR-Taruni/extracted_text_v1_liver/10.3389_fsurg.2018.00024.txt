Introduction: The component separation technique (CST) was introduced to abdominal 
wall reconstruction to treat large, complex hernias. It is very difficult to compare the 
published findings because of the vast number of technical modifications to CST as well 
as the heterogeneity of the patient population operated on with this technique.
Material and Methods: The main focus of the literature search conducted up to August 
2017 in Medline and PubMed was on publications reporting comparative findings as well 
as on systematic reviews in order to formulate statements regarding the various CSTs.
Results: CST without mesh should no longer be performed because of too high 
recurrence rates. Open anterior CST has too high a surgical site occurrence rate and 
henceforth should only be conducted as endoscopic and perforator sparing anterior 
CST. Open posterior CST and posterior CST with transversus abdominis release (TAR) 
produce better results than open anterior CST. To date, no significant differences have 
been found between endoscopic anterior, perforator sparing anterior CST and posterior 
CST with transversus abdominis release. Robot-assisted posterior CST with TAR is the 
latest, very promising alternative. The systematic use of biologic meshes cannot be 
recommended for CST.
Conclusion: CST should always be performed with mesh as endoscopic or perforator 
sparing anterior or posterior CST. Robot-assisted posterior CST with TAR is the latest 
development.

Introduction
The component separation technique (CST) was introduced for abdominal wall reconstruction to 
treat large, complex hernias (1). The options for closing large and complex abdominal wall defects, 
including primary repair, mesh, and distant muscle flaps, have yielded suboptimal results (1). Albanese 
and Ramirez first developed the CST to address this issue (2–6). “CST is based on the concept of 
re-establishing a functional abdominal wall with autologous tissue repair” (1). “The procedure involves 
dividing the relatively fixed external oblique aponeurosis and muscle, elevating the rectus abdominis 
muscle from its posterior rectus sheath, and then mobilizing the myofascial flap consisting of the 
rectus, internal oblique, and transversus abdominis medially” (1).

Scheuerlein et al. CST for Abdominal Wall Hernia
In the meantime numerous different CSTs have been described. 
In the “classic” CST a distinction is made between the open anterior 
and posterior approach. In recent years a special type of posterior 
CST, transversus abdominis release (TAR), was introduced. 
Furthermore, endoscopic variants of the anterior and posterior 
CST have been developed. The most recent innovations are the 
laparoscopic and robot-assisted TAR.
By now, there are several studies and reviews that report on the 
CST range of topics. But this is hampered by the, in some cases 
fundamental, technical differences, widespread heterogeneity of 
the data, different methodological approaches to data evaluation 
and results assessment, and accordingly the overall large variance 
in the quality of the studies. The postulated advantages of CST are 
thought to derive especially from lower recurrence and morbidity 
rates. While at first glance these advantages appear plausible, to 
date it has not been possible to demonstrate any tangible benefit 
conferred by CST. On the contrary, wound infection rates of up to 
57% have been identified (1).
The following review of the literature presents the different CST 
variants followed by a summary of the findings for each variant. 
The main focus here is on ascertaining the preferred CST variant 
based on the available data. Accordingly, particular attention will be 
paid to the findings of systematic reviews and combined literature 
sources.
Systematic Literature Search
The literature search was carried out up to August 2017 using 
Medline (PubMed). CST related-topics were systematically 
searched using appropriate search terms (component/s separation, 
component separation technique, fascial component separation, 
separation of components, component release, separation of parts, 
complex ventral hernia repair, complex abdominal wall repair, 
giant hernia). In addition, a manual search of the references was 
performed to identify relevant publications. All types of clinical 
trials and systematic reviews were included at first.
Duplicate publications, when identified, were excluded. Likewise 
excluded were studies with n < 10 patients or with highly specific 
key questions which did not appear to lend themselves for literature 
comparison purposes (e.g., case reports, parastomal hernias, purely 
experimental studies, pediatric abdominal wall defects, studies with 
exclusively post-traumatic abdominal wall defects, CST performed 
in the setting of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy 
(HIPEC) or CST conducted essentially in conjunction with flap 
surgery).
CST Modifications
Using as search term “CST”, numerous different techniques 
can be found in the literature. However, direct comparison 
is hampered by the, in some cases fundamental, anatomical 
differences. The current literature does not permit any clear 
statement to be made regarding a particular CST type. CST types 
can be distinguished on the basis of the following criteria: on the 
one hand, anterior versus posterior CST and, on the other hand, 
open versus minimally invasive techniques. Ramirez et al. (4) 
demonstrated in anatomical studies “that the external oblique 
muscle can be separated from the internal oblique muscle in a 
relatively avascular plane”. The rectus muscle with its overlying 
rectus fascia can be elevated from the posterior rectus sheath. The 
compound flap of the rectus muscle, with its attached internal 
oblique and transversus abdominis muscles, can be advanced 
10 cm around the waistline. The external oblique has limited 
advancement.
The “classic” anterior component separation technique is well 
described by Clarke (7):
“Midline scar excision is followed by extensive skin flap 
mobilization. The lateral border of the rectus muscle is located, 
as well as a point 1 cm lateral to the rectus, the external oblique 
aponeurosis and muscle are divided from the inguinal region 
to the costal margin. Lateral dissection deep to the external 
oblique allows creation of a “sliding myofascial flap” consisting 
of internal oblique and transversus muscles. Cephalad to the 
costal margin, where the rib cage protects against herniation, 
the lateral border of the rectus may be released to allow these 
muscles to be mobilized from the chest wall and apposed in the 
midline to “fill” the epigastrium. Attenuated tissue around the 
hernia is resected, and the posterior rectus sheath may also be 
incised longitudinally, if additional mobilization is desirable. The 
midline is then closed with a single layer of heavy monofilament 
suture” (7).
Carbonell et al. (8) have published the technique of “classic” 
posterior component separation:
“A midline laparotomy is performed with complete lysis 
of adhesions. Retromuscular space is developed by incising 
the posterior rectus sheath and dissecting the rectus muscle 
anteriorly. Once the lateralmost edge of the rectus sheath is 
reached, the posterior rectus sheath is incised, dividing the 
posterior aponeurotic sheath of the internal oblique muscle. 
This allows access to the plane between the internal oblique and 
transversus abdominis muscle. Dissection is carried out as far 
lateral, inferior, and superior as desired, allowing for a large mesh 
underlay. The posterior rectus sheath is then reapproximated 
in the midline with a running suture. The mesh is placed in 
the retromuscular space and secured with sutures. The anterior 
rectus sheath is then reapproximated in the midline to cover 
the mesh” (8).
Novitsky et al. (9) have described the novel technique of 
transversus abdominis release (TAR) (Figure 1B):
“The retromuscular plane is developed toward the linea 
similunaris, visualizing the junction between the posterior and 
anterior rectus sheaths. The perforators to the rectus muscle 
(branches of the thoracoabdominal nerves, penetrating the 
lateral edge of the posterior rectus sheath) are visualized and 
preserved. Starting in the upper third of the abdomen, about 
0.5 cm medial to the anterior/posterior rectus sheath junction, 
the posterior rectus sheath is incised to expose the underlying 
transversus abdominis muscle. The muscle is then divided 
along its entire medial edge using electrocautery. This step is 
initiated in the upper third of the abdomen where medial fibers 
of the transversus abdominis muscle are easiest to identify and 
separate from the underlying fascia. This step allows entrance 

Scheuerlein et al.

CST for Abdominal Wall Hernia
to the space between the transversalis fascia and the divided 
transversus abdominis muscle. Once similar release is performed 
on both sides, the posterior rectus sheaths are reapproximated 
in the midline with a running monofilament suture. The mesh is 
placed as a sublay in the retromuscular space and secured with 
sutures. The anterior rectus sheaths are then reapproximated 
in the midline to restore the linea alba ventral to the mesh”(9).
Clarke (7) has also reported about the details of the anterior 
component separation technique with perforator preservation using 
balloon dissection:
“Fascial separation is done through separate inguinal incisions. 
After incising the external oblique aponeurosis as in standard 
inguinal hernia repair, the balloon dissector is placed between 
the external and internal oblique muscles, advanced cephalad, 
and inflated . The lateral border of the rectus muscle acts as an 
anatomical barrier and forces the balloon to expand laterally, 
creating the necessary space. With headlamp illumination 
and a narrow retractor, a sponge forceps completes the fascial 
separation . Ultrasonic shears are then used to incise the elevated 
external oblique aponeurosis and the muscular portion found 
more cephalad. After fascial release has been done bilaterally, 
the midline scar is excised and minimal skin flaps are raised to 
free the hernia sac, thus preserving the periumbilical perforator 
vessels. The posterior rectus sheath is incised from within the 
midline incision. Midline closure is done as described for the 
“classic” anterior CST” (7).
Rosen et al. (10) have reported their initial experience with 
the endoscopic anterior component separation technique of parts
(Figure 1A):
“The operation begins with a 1 cm incision just below the 
costal margin lateral to the rectus abdominis muscle. The 
subcutaneous tissues are bluntly divided, exposing the external 
oblique aponeurosis. The fibers are split in their natural 
orientation and the internal oblique muscle is exposed. The 
potential space between the internal and external oblique is 
created using a bilateral endoscopic inguinal hernia balloon 
dissector. A structural balloon port is then placed in this space 
to maintain insufflation pressures of 12 mmHg. The tip of a 10 
mm 30° laparoscope is utilized to bluntly dissect the space under 
direct vision. Two additional 5 mm ports are then placed. The 
external oblique is then released from the costal margin to the 
inguinal ligament using coagulating scissors or ultrasonic shears. 
The process is repeated on the opposite side. If additional release 
is deemed necessary, the posterior rectus sheath is incised from 
the midline wound” (10).
Belyansky et al.  (11) have presented the novel technique 
of laparoscopic posterior component separation technique and 
transversus abdominis release:
“Typically three ports are placed bilaterally. After reduction of 
the hernia content and adhesiolysis, the posterior rectus sheath 
is released approximately 0.5 to 1 cm lateral to the edge of the 
defect and linea alba. The incision in the posterior rectus sheath 
is performed along its whole length from cephalad to caudal 
direction. Hook electrocautery combined with laparoscopic 
scissors sharp dissection are used to achieve this release, which 
exposes the posterior portion of the rectus abdominis muscle. 
When performed appropriately it can allow up to 3 cm of medial 
mobilization of the edge of the defect. Once the posterior rectus 
sheath is released, atraumatic graspers are used to retract the 
free edge of posterior rectus sheath medially to facilitate blunt 
dissection in the retrorectus space laterally toward the linea 
semilunaris. The neurovascular bundles that travel between the 
internal oblique and transversus muscles and then perforate the 
rectus abdominis muscle are identified laterally in this space 
and are preserved to prevent rectus defunctionalization and 
atrophy. With preservation of the neurovascular bundle about 
0.5–1 cm medial to the anterior/posterior rectus sheath junction, 
the posterior rectus sheath is incised to expose the underlying 
transversus abdominis muscle. Hook electrocautery is then 
used to elevate the transversalis muscle fibers and cauterize 
them. As the transversus fibers are cut the posterior layer of 
glistening transversalis fascia is exposed. Transversalis release

Scheuerlein et al. CST for Abdominal Wall Hernia
is performed in this fashion in a cephalad to caudal direction. 
Blunt dissection just posterior to the transversus muscle and 
superficial to the transversalis fascia is performed and is carried 
past the midaxillary line. Unilateral TAR can achieve up to 7 
cm of fascial medial mobilization. After closure of the posterior 
rectus sheath in a running fashion, the mesh is placed behind 
the muscles and fixed. The anterior fascial defect is then sutured 
“upside down” (11).
The use of robotic surgery to perform the transversus abdominis 
release technique has also been reported meanwhile (12).
Should the “Classic” CST (Anterior Open) 
Without Mesh Be Performed?
“Among patients with midline abdominal incisional hernias, 
mesh repair is superior to suture repair with regard to the 
recurrence of hernia, regardless of the size of the hernia” (13, 14). 
As repair of ventral hernias with mesh has substantially improved 
long-term outcomes, it is therefore accepted as the standard of 
care (15, 16). Against that background the question arises as 
to whether the CST without mesh as reported by Ramirez (4) 
can be performed with acceptable results. In a review article 
Tong et al. (17) compared open CST with and without mesh. 
Patients who had open CST with mesh appeared to do better 
than those who had open CST alone. Open CST with mesh 
compared with open CST alone appeared to be associated with 
fewer hernia recurrences with mesh (16.7%) vs without mesh 
(27%) and overall complications (with mesh: 21% vs without 
mesh: 59%) (17).
A systematic review by Deerenberg et al. (18) found seven 
studies of incisional hernia repair with the “classic” CST, 
including one randomized controlled trial. A total of 219 large 
incisional hernias were repaired using CST without mesh. In 
approximately 40% of cases, patients had a complex incisional 
hernia. Postoperative complications occurred in almost 50%. 
Infection or necrosis of the wound occurred in 20%, hematoma 
in 8% and seroma in 9%. Recurrence after CST occurred 
in 16% (18).
In a systematic review of autologous tissue repair of large 
abdominal wall defects, CST was the best documented procedure 
(19). It was associated with a high morbidity rate of 24.0%. After 
a follow-up period of at least one year the recurrence rate was 
18.2% (19).
In a qualitative systematic review for treatment of giant 
incisional hernias the authors concluded that mesh repair 
appeared to be superior to CST without mesh with regard to 
the recurrence rate (20). In open CST without mesh outcomes 
were beset with high morbidity, related mainly to major 
wound complications, skin necrosis, hematoma, pulmonary 
complications (23–100%) and a high clinical recurrence 
rate (5–53%) within a follow-up period ranging from 15 to 
52 months (20).
Slater et al. (21) performed their own prospective study and 
compared their results with a literature review. Prospective 
patient follow-up was undertaken of consecutive patients who 
underwent repair of large and complex ventral hernias using CST 
without mesh utilization (21). Primary outcome was recurrent 
hernia determined by clinical examination at least one year after 
surgery. Meta-analysis of the current literature was performed 
regarding outcomes and mode of follow-up. This included 75 
patients with a mean age of 52.2 years and mean defect size of 
214.9 cm2
. Twenty-nine patients (38.7%) had a recurrent hernia 
after a mean of 40.9 month follow-up, and this was significantly 
higher than in the literature (14.0%, p < 0.01). Sixty-four per 
cent of studies in the literature were unclear about the method 
of determining recurrent hernia or included telephone follow-up 
and questionnaires (21). The authors concluded that repair of large 
ventral hernias using CST without mesh coincides with a high 
recurrence rate (21).
In the only prospective randomized study comparing CST 
without mesh vs mesh repair in giant midline abdominal wall 
hernia, the recurrence rate in the CST group without mesh after 
36 months was 52.6% (22).
In a case series of 85 patients with repair of complex abdominal 
wall hernias using CST, the overall recurrence rate after a mean 
follow-up of 14.4 months was 14.1 and 11.1% when a mesh was 
used to reinforce the repair technique (23).
In conclusion, the hernia recurrence rates remain high 
without mesh reinforcement even when using tension-reducing 
procedures such as CST (24) and should therefore no longer be 
performed. In an expert consensus guided by systematic review 
of ventral hernia management, the avoidance of CST without 
mesh reinforcement is therefore recommended (24).
Do Perioperative Complication Rates 
Justify Performance of “Classic” (Anterior 
Open Without Mesh) or Modified (Anterior 
Open with Mesh) CST?
Unfortunately, standard anterior CST is not without its own 
procedural morbidity (1). The extensive lateral dissection 
required to create large subcutaneous skin flaps leads to marked 
wound complications (1). “Specifically, ligating a significant 
proportion of the perforating abdominal wall blood vessels 
predisposes the flap to ischemia and infection, in addition to 
potential formation of hematomas and seromas in the dead 
space (1). Wound infection rates have been shown to range from 
25 to 57%” (1).
In the review by Tong et al. (17) the overall complication rate 
was reported to be 21% with mesh and 50% without mesh. In 
their review Deerenberg et al. (18) identified for anterior open 
CST without mesh a postoperative complication rate of almost 
50% and for anterior open CST with mesh of 55%.
In the review of surgical treatment for giant incisional hernias 
by Eriksson et al. (20), the total morbidity following CST with 
or without mesh ranged between 15 and 100%.
In the only randomized controlled trial the wound 
complication rate after “classic” anterior open CST without mesh 
was reported to be 52.6% (22).
Against a background of the high complication rate 
associated with the “classic” and modified anterior open CST, 
the guidelines recommended performance of the alternative 
CST, such as a perforator sparing, endoscopic or posterior CST 
technique (16, 24).

CST for Abdominal Wall Hernia
Does Perforator Sparing or Endoscopic 
Anterior CST Have Advantages Compared 
to “Classic” or Modified Anterior Open 
Techniques?
In a retrospective comparative study Clarke (7) reported 
significantly higher rates of skin necrosis (p < 0.001) and chronic 
pain (p = 0.003) for the “classic” technique vs the perforator 
preservation procedure with fascial release through separate 
inferolateral incisions.
In a review Pauli et al. (25) showed for perforator sparing CST 
a wound complication rate of 3.1%-26.3% and a recurrence rate 
of 3–13.8%.
Switzer et al. (1) have published a systematic review and metaanalysis with inclusion of 63 primary studies (seven controlled 
studies and 56 cases series) and 3,055 patients comparing 
endoscopic anterior vs open CST. “The total wound complication 
rate was lower for endoscopic anterior CST (20.6%) compared to 
open CST (34.6%). Endoscopic anterior CST compared to open 
CST was shown to have lower rates of superficial infections (3.5 
vs 8.9%), skin dehiscence (5.3 vs 8.2%), necrosis (2.1 vs 6.8%), 
hematoma/seroma formation (4.6 vs 7.4%), fistula tract formation 
(0.4 vs 1.0%), fascial dehiscence (0 vs 0.4%), and mortality (0.4 
vs 0.6%). The open CST did have lower rates of intraabdominal 
abscess formation (3.8 vs 4.6%) and recurrence rates (11.1 vs 
15.1%)” (1). Four further studies not included in the systematic 
review come to the same conclusions (26–29).
A recent systematic review of CST for giant incisional hernia 
reported for open anterior CST and endoscopic anterior CST 
surgical site occurrences of 21.4 and 20.3%, respectively, and 
recurrence rates of 11.9 and 7%, respectively (30).
The guidelines recommend that preference be given to the 
endoscopic anterior CST over the “classic” or modified anterior 
open CST (24).
Does Posterior CST Have Better
Results Than Anterior CST?
Retromuscular or sublay hernia repair with mesh ”has proven to 
be a durable technique for ventral hernia defects, and completely 
avoids subcutaneous flap elevation” (8). “Technically, the 
retromuscular technique requires developing the space dorsal to 
the rectus abdominis muscles up to the edge of the rectus sheath” 
(8). “In the average patient, this translates into a 6–8 cm lateral 
space on each side of the midline” (8). “Repair of large hernia 
defects with diameters greater than 15 cm may require a larger 
mesh overlap than can be afforded by dissection limited to the 
confines of the rectus sheath” (8). “By incising the posterior rectus 
sheath and creating the plane between the internal oblique and 
transversus abdominis muscles (“classic” posterior CST), there is 
a space virtually unlimited in size in which to place large meshes 
for hernia repair” (8).
In a case series of 20 patients with a “classic” posterior CST three 
developed wound complications (15%) and none complained of 
long-term pain or abdominal wall deformity (8). There has been 
one recurrence (5%) after a mean 12 month follow-up (8).
Novitsky and Rosen (9) developed a novel technique of 
posterior component separation using transversus abdominis 
muscle release (TAR). This modification allows for significant 
posterior rectus fascia advancement, wide lateral dissection, 
preservation of the neurovascular supply, avoids subcutaneous 
tissue undermining, and provides a large space for mesh sublay 
(9). In the case series by Novitsky and Rosen (9) the TAR technique 
was used in 42 patients with complex ventral hernia, including 32 
recurrences, with an average number of previous repairs of 2.9 
(range, 1–8). Postoperative wound complications occurred in 10 
(24%) patients with three (7%) major wound infections (9). At 
a median follow-up period of 26.1 months, there have been two 
(4.7%) recurrences (9).
In a review by Pauli et al. (25) the outcome for posterior 
component separation including TAR, showed a wound 
complication rate of 3.4–31% and a recurrence rate of 1.1–7.3%.
In a retrospective comparative study by Krpata et al. (31) wound 
complications occurred in significantly more open anterior CST 
than open posterior CST (48.2 vs 25.5%, p = 0.01). The recurrence 
rate was also higher in the open anterior CST group (14.3 vs 3.6%, 
p = 0.09) (31).
Posterior component separation with transversus abdominis 
release also successfully addresses recurrent ventral hernia 
following anterior component separation (32).
For complex incisional hernias in kidney transplant recipients, 
TAR is associated with low perioperative morbidity and durable 
repair (33).
In the largest case series of 428 consecutive TAR procedures 
80 (18.7%) surgical site events occurred, of which 39 (9.1%) were 
surgical site infections. Three patients required mesh debridement; 
however, no instance of mesh explantation occurred. Of the 347 
(81%) patients with at least one-year follow-up (mean 31.5 months), 
there were 13 (3.7%) recurrences (34).
The recent systematic review by Cornette et al. (30) included 
22 studies with 1,348 cases for open anterior approach and eight 
studies with 761 cases for posterior CST with transversus abdominis 
release (TAR). They found surgical site occurrence rates of 21.4% 
for the open anterior approach and 20.3% for posterior CST with 
TAR. The recurrence rates were 11.9 vs 5.25% (p < 0.001) (30).
The guidelines of an expert group contain a statement that 
posterior CST is associated with a lower wound complication rate 
in comparison to standard anterior CST (24). However, the findings 
of the systematic review tend to show advantages for posterior CST 
with TAR with regard to the recurrence rate rather than to surgical 
site occurrences (30).
Are There Differences Between the 
Perforator Sparing Anterior, Endoscopic 
Anterior and Posterior CST?
While there are no prospective randomized trials or meta-analyses, 
the available data demonstrate that preference should be given to 
the perforator sparing anterior, endoscopic anterior and “classic” or 
TAR posterior CST over the “classic” and modified anterior CST. A 
mesh should always be used for CST. Among these remaining CST 
cases there is no consensus in the guidelines of an expert group on 
the best CST technique because of a lack of high quality data (24).

Frontiers in Surgery | www.frontiersin.org 6 March 2018 | Volume 5 | Article 24
Scheuerlein et al. CST for Abdominal Wall Hernia
The best comparative analysis can be found in the recently 
published systematic review by Cornette et al. (30). In addition 
to eight studies and 761 cases related to TAR, this included 13 
studies with 193 cases for endoscopic anterior CST and five studies 
with 242 cases for anterior perforator sparing CST. The identified 
surgical site occurrence rates were 16.0% for perforator sparing 
anterior CST, 20.3% for endoscopic anterior CST, and 23.7% for 
TAR. The corresponding recurrence rates were 6.47, 7.02 and 
5.25%, respectively. Based on that systematic review, no relevant 
differences were identified between these techniques.
This serves as confirmation of the statement issued by the expert 
committee on that comparison (24). Accordingly, high quality 
studies are urgently needed to explore this key question.
Robotic Posterior CST with
Transversus Abdominis Release 
(TAR)
The introduction of posterior CST with transversus abdominis 
release using a robot-assisted technique is the latest development 
in the CST setting (12). Warren et al. (34) compared 103 standard 
laparoscopic ventral hernia repairs with 53 robotic posterior CST 
with transversus abdominis release (Table 1). The hernia width was 
similar in both groups (6.9 vs 6.5 cm, p = 0.508). Fascial closure 
was achieved more often with the robotic technique (96.2 vs 50.5%; 
p < 0.001). But the operative time was longer with the robot (245 
min vs 122 min; p < 0.001). Seroma was more common after robotic 
posterior CST with TAR (47.2 vs 16.5%; p < 0.001), but surgical site 
infection was similar (3.8 vs 1%; p = 0.592). The median length of 
stay was shorter after robot-assisted CST with TAR (1 vs 2 days; 
p = 0.004).
Bittner et al. (36) compared 76 open posterior CST with TAR 
and 26 robot-assisted posterior CST with TAR. Patients were 
comparable regarding age, gender, body mass index, and the 
presence of comorbidities. Diabetes was more common in the open 
group (22.3 vs 0%; p = 0.001). Most ventral hernias were midline 
(89.5 vs 83%; p = 0.47) and recurrent hernias (52.6 vs 58.3%; 
p = 0.65). Hernia characteristics were similar regarding defect size 
(260 ± 209 vs 235 ± 107 cm2
; p = 0.55). The average operative 
time was longer in the robot cohort (287 ± 121 vs 365 ± 78 min; 
p < 0.01). Robot posterior CST with TAR trended toward lower 
morbidity (39.2 vs 19.2%; p = 0.09), less severe complications, and 
similar rates of surgical site events and readmission (6.6 vs 7.7%; 
p = 1.00). In addition, robotic posterior CST with TAR resulted in a 
significantly shorter median hospital length of stay compared to the 
open procedure (6 days, 95% CI 5.9–8.3 vs 3 days, 95% CI 3.2–4.3).
Martin-del-Campo et al. (37) compared 38 consecutive patients 
undergoing robotic posterior CST with TAR to 76 matched open 
posterior CST with TAR. Patient demographics were similar 
between the groups. The average operative time was significantly 
longer in the robotic TAR group (299 ± 95 vs 211 ± 63 min, 
p < 0.001) and blood loss was significantly lower for the robotic 
TAR group (49 ± 60 vs 139 ± 149 mL, p < 0.001). Wound morbidity 
was minimal in the robotic TAR group, but the rate of surgical 
site events and surgical site infection did not differ between the Table 1 | Results of robotic transversus abdominis release and retromuscular repair compared to laparoscopic or open repair.

groups. Systemic complications were significantly less frequent 
in the robotic TAR group (0 vs 17.1%, p = 0.026). The length of 
hospitalization was significantly reduced in the robotic TAR group 
(1.3 ± 1.3 vs 6.0 ± 3.4 days, p < 0.001).
In a matched pair analysis, Carbonell et al. (38) compared 
111 robot-assisted retromuscular ventral hernia repairs with 222 
open retromuscular ventral hernia repairs from the Americas 
Hernia Society Quality Collaborative Database (AHSQC). 
Median length of stay was significantly decreased for robotic 
retromuscular ventral hernia repair (2 days vs 3 days, p < 0.001). 
No difference was observed in 30 day readmissions or surgical 
site infection. Higher surgical site occurrences were noted with 
the robotic technique, consisting mainly of seroma that did not 
require intervention.
From the comparative investigations conducted to date it 
can be concluded that the use of a robot results in a prolonged 
operative time but a shorter hospital stay. So far no clear evidence 
has been found of advantages in terms of wound complications. 
The robot technique also appears to be associated with a higher 
seroma rate.
Once sufficient experience has been gathered with robotassisted posterior CST with TAR, the role of this technique 
compared with perforator sparing anterior, endoscopic anterior 
and open posterior CST with TAR must be ascertained in future 
comparative studies. With greater experience leading to a shorter 
operative time and lower robot costs per use, robot-assisted 
CST with TAR could become a mainstay for repair of complex 
abdominal wall hernias.
Does the Use of Biologic vs
Synthetic Meshes in CST Lead to a
Better Outcome in Repair of 
Complex Abdominal Wall Hernias?
In a review by the BioMesh Study Group of the evidence available 
on the use of biologic meshes in abdominal wall reconstruction, 
studies that compared complex abdominal wall hernia repair 
with CST using biologic vs synthetic meshes were analyzed (39). 
Based on only comparative studies, CST reinforced with biologic 
meshes has no significantly higher recurrence rate vs synthetic 
meshes in patients with complex abdominal wall hernia repair 
and at increased risk for surgical site occurrences/surgical site 
infections (39). The number of major surgical site occurrences/
surgical site infections, including the need for reoperation, does 
not seem to be decreased substantially by the use of biologic vs 
synthetic meshes (39). Therefore, the systematic use of biologic 
meshes in complex abdominal wall hernia repair in the absence 
of contamination is not recommended (39).
Conclusions
•  The “classic” anterior CST without mesh and “modified” anterior 
CST with mesh should no longer be performed because of too 
high surgical site occurrence rates. Besides, the “classic” anterior 
CST without mesh is associated with too high a recurrence rate.
•  Endoscopic and perforator sparing anterior CST are better alternatives to anterior CST.
•  Likewise, the “classic” posterior CST and posterior CST with 
transversus abdominis release produce better findings than the 
“classic” and “modified” anterior CST.
•  Based on the data available so far, no significant differences can 
be identified between the findings obtained for endoscopic anterior CST, perforator sparing anterior CST and posterior CST with 
transversus abdominis release.
•  At present, it is not possible to evaluate the role of laparoscopic 
and robot-assisted posterior CST with TAR.
•  The systematic use of biologic meshes in CST for complex abdominal hernia repair in the absence of contamination is not 
recommended.
•  The introduction of robot-assisted posterior CST with TAR is the 
latest development. While the findings so far reveal a prolonged 
operative time for the robot technique, they also show a shorter 
length of stay. To date, no conclusive findings are available regarding the perioperative complications.
