Hypertension is one of the most common cardiovascular co-morbidities after
successful kidney transplantation. It commonly occurs in patients with other metabolic
diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. The pathogenesis
of post-transplant hypertension is complex and is a result of the interplay between
immunological and non-immunological factors. Post-transplant hypertension can be
divided into immediate, early, and late post-transplant periods. This classification
can help clinicians determine the etiology and provide the appropriate management
for these complex patients. Volume overload from intravenous fluid administration is
common during the immediate post-transplant period and commonly contributes to
hypertension seen early after transplantation. Immunosuppressive medications and
donor kidneys are associated with post-transplant hypertension occurring at any time
point after transplantation. Transplant renal artery stenosis (TRAS) and obstructive
sleep apnea (OSA) are recognized but common and treatable causes of resistant
hypertension post-transplantation. During late post-transplant period, chronic renal
allograft dysfunction becomes an additional cause of hypertension. As these patients
develop more substantial chronic kidney disease affecting their allografts, fibroblast
growth factor 23 (FGF23) increases and is associated with increased cardiovascular
and all-cause mortality in kidney transplant recipients. The exact relationship between
increased FGF23 and post-transplant hypertension remains poorly understood.
Blood pressure (BP) targets and management involve both non-pharmacologic and
pharmacologic treatment and should be individualized. Until strong evidence in the kidney
transplant population exists, a BP of <130/80 mmHg is a reasonable target. Similar
to complete renal denervation in non-transplant patients, bilateral native nephrectomy

Tantisattamo et al. Approach and Management Post-KTx HTN
is another treatment option for resistant post-transplant hypertension. Native renal
denervation offers promising outcomes for controlling resistant hypertension with no
significant procedure-related complications. This review addresses the epidemiology,
pathogenesis, and specific etiologies of post-transplant hypertension including TRAS,
calcineurin inhibitor effects, OSA, and failed native kidney. The cardiovascular and survival
outcomes related to post-transplant hypertension and the utility of 24-h blood pressure
monitoring will be briefly discussed. Antihypertensive medications and their mechanism
of actions relevant to kidney transplantation will be highlighted. A summary of guidelines
from different professional societies for BP targets and antihypertensive medications as
well as non-pharmacological interventions, including bilateral native nephrectomy and
native renal denervation, will be reviewed.

INTRODUCTION
Barring contraindications, kidney transplantation is the
treatment of choice for advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD)
and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (1). Survival benefit and
quality of life are significantly improved after a successful
kidney transplantation with renal allograft function. Since
the introduction of calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) in the 1980’s,

short-term renal allograft survival has greatly improved, but
there has been no significant effect on long-term renal allograft
survival (2, 3).
Several immunological and non-immunological causes
contribute to long-term renal and patient survival outcomes.
Similar to non-transplant patients, cardiovascular diseases
(CVD) remain the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in
kidney transplant recipients (4). Hypertension (HTN) is a usual
finding in this population and one of the most common risk
factors for CVD (5).
This article will review the pathogenesis of posttransplant HTN, including transplant renal artery stenosis
(TRAS) and differing management options based on the
etiology of hypertension in different clinical transplant
recipient scenarios. Determining when non-pharmacological
interventions, including transplant renal artery angioplasty
and/or stenting, bilateral native nephrectomy, and native
renal denervation (RDN), are appropriate will also
be discussed.
EPIDEMIOLOGY OF POST-TRANSPLANT
HYPERTENSION
Depending on the definition and methods of blood pressure
(BP) measurement utilized, the prevalence of post-transplant
HTN has been widely reported, and it has generally increased
over time. This greater incidence of post-transplant hypertension
maybe related to the introduction of cyclosporine (CsA) (6–8). A
study in Spain looked at patients transplanted in three different
years (1990 vs. 1994 vs. 1998) and noted a progressive increase
in the incidence of post-transplant HTN with subsequent years
for all those three periods. The number of antihypertensive
medications required in more recent transplants also increased
compared to patients who were transplanted earlier (9). Overall
prevalence of post-transplant HTN has ranged from 24 to 90%
(5, 8–19).

DEFINITION OF POST-TRANSPLANT
HYPERTENSION
Post-kidney transplant HTN can be defined as a persistently
elevated BP or normotension with use of antihypertensive
medications after successful kidney transplantation.
However, the main question that remains is what is a
normal BP level? Different studies have defined posttransplant HTN with different cutoff levels for systolic
and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) and
different requirements for the use of antihypertensive
medications. Table 1 summarizes the details of these studies
(8, 9, 16–18).
In addition to the defining normal BP levels, the presence
or absence of HTN during the pre-kidney transplant period
may further categorize kidney transplant recipients into
four groups: persistent HTN, recovered HTN, persistent
normotension, and post-transplant HTN. Persistent HTN
occurs in patients with HTN both in the pre- and posttransplant periods, whereas patients with recovered HTN
have HTN only during the pre- but not the post-transplant
period. Persistent normotensive patients have no history
of HTN preceding transplant and remain normotensive
post-transplant. Post-transplant HTN requires developing
de novo HTN after kidney transplant (Figure 1). MalekHosseini et al. (17) reported the incidences of persistent
HTN, recovered HTN, persistent normotension, and posttransplant HTN as 40, 28, 13, and 19%, respectively.
In this review, post-kidney transplant HTN refers to
persistent and post-transplant (de novo) HTN unless
otherwise specified.
Isolated forms of HTN both systolic and diastolic still
occur after kidney transplantation. The European Society
of Hypertension and the European Society of Cardiology
guidelines defined isolated systolic HTN in the general
population as SBP ≥140 and DBP <90 mmHg (20). This
is the most common phenotype of HTN in elderly patients
(21). Linear increase in systolic and diastolic BP occurs
with age until the fifth or the sixth decades of life when
SBP continues increasing, but DBP tends to decrease (22).
Pathogenesis of isolated systolic HTN involves in both intrinsic
alterations resulting from normal aging process accompanied
by development of modifiable risk factors leading to increased
arterial stiffness (23).

Alternatively, diastolic HTN is defined as DBP of ≥90 mmHg,
with a SBP <140 mmHg, and is more common in younger,
sedentary individuals with a higher body mass index (BMI) (24).
A recent large randomized controlled clinical trial of
blood pressure management in non-diabetic patients (SPRINT)
demonstrated cardiovascular (CV) benefits of tighter BP control
(25) leading to new BP guidelines and re-defined HTN for
the general population as systolic blood pressure (SBP) >130
or DBP >80 mmHg (26, 27). Although there has been
a change in the definition of HTN in the non-transplant
population, the definition of HTN in kidney transplant recipients
remains controversial, and hard outcomes related to BP
levels are still limited. A recent 2017 American College of
Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines
recommend a target BP of <130/80 mmHg (26, 27). Until there

is stronger evidence of an association between BP level and
outcomes in kidney transplant recipients, a BP ≥130/80 mmHg
may be a reasonable definition for HTN in this population.
PATHOGENESIS OF POST-TRANSPLANT
HYPERTENSION
The change in prevalence of post-transplant HTN across
different post-transplant periods may reflect the differences
in pathogenesis of post-transplant HTN over time (Figure 2).
Identifying when post-transplant HTN first occurred can narrow
the differential diagnosis for the etiology of post-transplant HTN
and lead to tailored therapy.
Immediate Post-transplant Period
During this time, post-transplant HTN is generally a result of
external factors like transplant surgery, IV fluids, and high doses
of steroids.
Peri-transplant Hypervolemia
IV fluid given during surgery and in the immediate postoperative period can lead to hypervolemia, particularly
in patients with delayed graft function (DGF). A singlecenter cross-sectional study showed that the prevalence of
hypervolemia measured by multifrequency bioimpedance
analysis for extracellular fluid in stable kidney transplant
recipients was 30%, and up to 5% had severe hypervolemia. This
study showed that hypervolemia was significantly associated
with elevated systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressures (28).
Although this study enrolled 123 kidney transplant recipients
with a median duration of enrollment at 5 years post-transplant,
hypervolemia most commonly occurred during the immediate

Tantisattamo et al. Approach and Management Post-KTx HTN
post-transplant period, and weight gain above the pre-transplant
estimated dry weight was associated with HTN.
Several indicators can be used to estimate volume status.
These include conventional measurements such as BP, heart
rate, urine output, central venous pressure, and pulmonary
artery pressure as well as non-conventional measurements
such as intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography and
non-invasive dynamic cardiac output technology, e.g., pulse
contour analysis, pulse wave transit time, thoracic electrical
bioimpedance/bioreactance, and carbon dioxide rebreathing
technologies (29, 30). Although many of the non-conventional
measurements are useful for volume assessment, they are not
readily available during peri-transplant period and conventional
measurements remain the standard in clinical practice.
High-Dose Steroids
High-dose steroids are commonly used immunosuppressive
medications during the peri-transplant period. The incidence
of steroid-induced HTN during the immediate post-transplant
period is unknown. The mechanism of steroid-induced HTN is
unclear, but it may result from alterations in intrinsic pressor
response leading to arterial vascular resistance (31). Since a
steroid dose of more than 20 mg of prednisone per day is
the threshold for having HTN (32), high-dose IV steroids can
contribute to HTN during immediate post-transplant period.
Rebound Hypertension
ESRD patients commonly have uncontrolled HTN and require
several medications to control their BP. During the immediate
post-transplant period, it is common practice to hold some if
not all of the pre-transplant BP medications in an effort to
avoid early hypotension. However, this abrupt discontinuation of
antihypertensive therapy can lead to rebound hypertension, an
elevated BP above pretreatment levels, as a result of sympathetic
overactivity. Beta-adrenergic agonists, clonidine (both oral and
transdermal forms) (33), and beta-blockers are commonly
associated with this phenomenon, particularly when abruptly
stopped. Geyskes et al. demonstrated that almost all patients
who took clonidine 900 mcg per day for more than 1 month
developed hypertension after the medication was discontinued.
Sympathetic overactivity without renin angiotensin system
mediation plays a major role in the mechanism of rebound HTN
from clonidine (34).
Similar to clonidine, rebound HTN from beta-blockers causes
elevated BP and heart rate. It also leads to cardiac events
including angina, myocardial infarction, or sudden cardiac death
in patients with underlying coronary artery disease (CAD) (35–
39). Increased sympathetic activity associated with upregulated
adrenergic receptors in individuals taking beta-blockers is
thought to be the mechanism of beta-blockers rebound HTN (36,
38, 40). Given the cardiac risk with peri-operative beta-blocker
withdrawal (41, 42), the 2014 ACC/AHA guidelines give a class
I recommendation with B level evidence for the continuation of
beta-blockers during the peri-operative period in patients who
chronically use them (43).
Inappropriate Pain Management
Acute pain is associated with elevated BP via sympathetic nervous
system activation, leading to increases in peripheral vascular
resistance, heart rate, and stroke volume. In addition stimulation
of the neuroendocrine system via hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal axis leads to pain-induced HTN (44). Inadequate perioperative pain control is one of the most common causes of HTN
immediately post-transplant. Opioid analgesic is commonly used
for pain management during immediate post-transplant period.
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) can provide
effective pain relief, but should be avoided in the post-transplant
period because of their negative renal effects, including reduced
renal plasma flow particularly in patient without establishing
renal allograft function or those with DGF.
Early Post-transplant Period
There has not been a period after kidney transplantation that
has been classically defined as the early post-transplant period.
However, we found that systolic HTN (≥140 mmHg) occurred at
the mean duration of 26–50 weeks after kidney transplantation
(45), while the baseline renal allograft function and stable dose
of maintenance immunosuppressive medications are generally
reached around 3–6 months post-transplant. Therefore, we
define the early post-transplant period for this review as the time
between 24 and 52 weeks post-transplantation. During which
time several factors contribute to HTN.
Weight Gain
Between 6- and 12-months post-transplantation, weight gain
commonly occurs (46, 47). The mean weight gain and increase
in BMI at 1 year post-transplant is 6.2 ± 10.7 kg and 2.1 ± 3.8
kg/m2, respectively (47). Obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2
) after kidney
transplantation is significantly associated with post-transplant
HTN (48). Positive fluid intake from intra-and post-operative IV
fluid is a common cause of weight gain during the early posttransplant period (49). The amount of sodium in the IV fluid
can contribute to HTN. However, after regaining renal allograft
function, urinary excretion of the fluid gain can mobilize sodium
and water. This can partly help to control BP.
Calcineurin Inhibitors
The prevalence of HTN in kidney transplant recipients is between
70 and 90% (50, 51), which is greater than the prevalence during
pre-CNI era of 40–50% (52, 53). There are two main mechanism
of CNI-induced post-transplant HTN resulting from interfering
vascular tone and renal sodium transport handling.
Altered vascular tone
Both increased vasoconstriction and impaired vasodilation
contribute to CNI-induced post-transplant HTN; although, the
latter is thought to be the main mechanism (54).
Renal vasoconstriction. Renal vasoconstriction is mediated by
endothelin, a vasoconstrictor, rather than angiotensin II, as
captopril does not prevent CsA-induced renal vasoconstriction
(55). However, the vasoconstrictive effect on renal or systemic
vasculature remains unclear (56). There are inconsistent reports
on the effect of angiotensin II on blood vessels. CsA causes

Tantisattamo et al. Approach and Management Post-KTx HTN
local effect on smooth muscle cells by increasing the number of
angiotensin II type 1 receptors resulting in vasoconstriction (57).
Renal vasodilation. Impaired vasodilation is a result of CNIinduced reduction of nitric oxide, a vasodilator. CNIs inhibit
inducible nitric oxide synthase in vascular smooth muscle
cells (58).
Increased renal sodium transport handling
Sympathetic nervous system activation. CsA causes sympathetic
excitation and subsequent sodium retention (59). There is a
link between CNI-induced HTN and phospho-protein synapsin
found on microvesicles in renal sensory nerve endings (60).
With-No-K(Lys)—STE20/SPS1-related proline/alanine-rich
kinase—Sodium Chloride Cotransporter (WNK-SPAKNCC) pathway. CNI induces salt-sensitive HTN via activation
of the WNK- SPAK-NCC pathway similarly to a rare genetic
form of HTN, called familial hyperkalemic hypertension (FHHt,
also called Gordon syndrome or pseudohypoaldosteronism
type 2) (61). FHHt results from a loss-of-function mutation
of WNK kinases that activate NCC (62) and manifests as
hyperkalemic hypertension with a non-anion gap metabolic
acidosis and hypercalciuria (61). In normal circumstances,
calcineurin, a phosphatase, inhibits some kinases, including
the kinases WNK3, WNK4, and SPAK in the distal convoluted
tubule (DCT), which interact to phosphorylate and activate NCC
(54, 63). CNI inhibits calcineurin and leads to phosphorylation
and activation of WNK and SPAK kinases and NCC. Therefore,
sodium and chloride reabsorption in the DCT is increased and
salt-sensitive HTN occurs. Low fractional excretion of chloride
supports increased NCC activity (64), and a decreased plasma
aldosterone level is consistent with volume expansion (54). From
a mechanistic standpoint, thiazide diuretics should be effective
for CNI-induced HTN (54, 65).
Steroids
Since steroids can cause HTN, steroid avoidance or withdrawal
(SAW) maintenance immunosuppressive medication regimens
can be considered. However, the effect of SAW on post-transplant
HTN has yielded conflicting data. Curtis et al. (10) showed that
the prevalence of HTN decreased in patients taking alternateday steroid therapy. A systematic review and meta-analysis
revealed that steroid avoidance or withdrawal significantly
decreases CV outcomes including HTN but increases risk of
acute rejection (66). It is common for steroids to be reintroduced
after a diagnosis of acute rejection in recipients who were
initially managed with a SAW regimen. A randomized control
trial, however, demonstrated no difference in blood pressure
change between alternative day and daily prednisone (67). SAW
protocols should be considered in select patients, specifically
those who would be at greater risk for CV outcomes but be
immunologically lower risk of rejection.
Hypertensive Donor Kidney
Salt intake can lead to water retention and HTN, especially in saltsensitive individuals (68). In addition, several animal studies have
demonstrated a renal role in the development of HTN (69–73).
Kidney transplantation from idiopathic hypertensive rat donors
to genetically normotensive recipients led to post-transplant
HTN resulting from decreased renal salt excretion. On the
other hand, transplantation from genetically normotensive rat
donors to hypertensive rats with pre-transplant bilateral native
nephrectomy led to normotension after transplantation (74).
A study in kidney transplant recipients who had
undergone native nephrectomy before kidney transplantation
from normotensive donors found that all recipients were
normotensive post-transplant without need for antihypertensive
therapy (75). Another study in kidney transplant recipients from
normotensive families found a net increase in antihypertensive
requirement antihypertensive requirement after kidney
transplantation when kidneys came from donors with
hypertensive families compared to those receiving kidneys
from donors with normotensive families. However, in recipients
with familial HTN, kidney transplantation from any type of
kidney did not influence the prevalence of post-transplant
HTN (76). In addition, among kidney transplant recipients
with no family history of HTN, patients receiving kidneys from
donors with family history of HTN required 10 times greater
antihypertensive medication requirement as compared to those
who receive kidneys from donors without a family history of
HTN (77). This all suggests a role for kidney and genetic kidney
disease in developing HTN.
Transplant Renal Artery Stenosis (TRAS)
Vascular complications are one of the major causes of poorer
transplant outcomes. TRAS is a well-recognized and common
vascular complication, which leads to worse renal allograft
function and CV complications including post-transplant HTN.
It is crucial to recognize this early since treatment cause reverse
those negative outcomes. Approximately 1–5% of post-transplant
HTN is secondary to TRAS (78, 79). However, because of
differing definitions applied in studies, the incidence of TRAS
was reported to increase from 1 to 23% (80). Wong et al. (81)
reported that the prevalence of TRAS increased from 2.4 to
12.4% after the introduction of color Doppler ultrasonography
(CDU) in 1985, likely related to improved detection with noninvasive testing. TRAS may occur at any time after kidney
transplantation but is generally diagnosed between 3 and 24
months post transplantation (82–84). Unlike renal artery stenosis
(RAS) in non-transplant patients, pathogenesis of TRAS is
complex and involves non-immunological and immunological
factors (81, 85). The non-immunological factors include vascular
damage at the time of surgical anastomosis between the donor
renal artery and recipient artery as well as the presence of
native vascular diseases in both donor and recipient arteries
(86). Because the recipient iliac artery, not the abdominal
aorta, is the most common vascular target for donor renal
artery anastomosis, the connection between these smaller arteries
may be predisposed to narrowing and subsequent development
of TRAS physiology (87). Fibromuscular dysplasia is not a
common cause of RAS in transplant patients. Immunological
factors leading to vascular endothelial dysfunction can cause
TRAS. Other transplant-related risk factors have been reported
including cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection (88). Similar to
Frontiers in Medicine | www.frontiersin.org 6 June 2020 | Volume 7 | Article 229

Tantisattamo et al. Approach and Management Post-KTx HTN
non-transplant patients, atherosclerotic disease can cause TRAS,
but pathogenesis of atherosclerotic TRAS may be different.
Atherosclerotic TRAS is unlikely to occur in the early posttransplant period unless there is pre-existing donor and/or
recipient atherosclerotic diseases (89). In addition to traditional
risk factors for atherosclerotic disease, some immunologic factors
may be at play in atherosclerotic TRAS. For example, diffuse
stenosis may suggest immune-mediated vascular endothelial
injury (90). Moreover, similar histological findings between
vascular rejection and stenotic transplant renal arteries (82, 91)
as well as an association between post anastomotic TRAS and de
novo class II donor-specific antibodies (92) raise the possibility of
immunologic contribution to atherosclerotic TRAS.
Symptoms and signs of TRAS are non-specific; however,
common clinical clues that should lead to a work-up for TRAS are
unexplained worsening renal allograft function or uncontrolled
HTN (79). Since renal hypoperfusion causes increased renin,
angiotensin, and aldosterone, salt retention can lead to peripheral
edema, congestive heart failure, and flash pulmonary edema.
Notably, paradoxical normotension or hypotension can be seen
with use of high-dose diuretics and/or angiotensin-converting
enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor blockers
(ARB) (93). Bruits over transplant renal allografts site are
common but non-specific. Bruits may be related to other causes
like arteriovenous fistula (AVF) in a kidney after biopsy (94).
Several imaging studies can be used to diagnose TRAS. CDU
is often the initial imaging study used because it is non-invasive,
widely available, and relatively inexpensive. However, the image
quality and interpretation are dependent on ultrasonographer
technique and experience. Peak systolic velocity (PSV) of the
main renal artery and poststenotic intrarenal arterial resistive
index (RI) are used to determine and grade the severity of
TRAS (79). However, since the diagnostic value of CDU is
operator dependent, other imaging modalities may be utilized
to verify the diagnosis. Renal artery computed tomography (CT)
or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) should be utilized to
further delineate or confirm the diagnosis. However, the risk of
contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) and nephrogenic systemic
fibrosis would need to be considered and may limit the use of
these imaging studies. Renal artery angiography remains the gold
standard diagnostic test for TRAS, but it is invasive and can lead
to CIN. Carbon dioxide (CO2) angiography can mitigate some of
the risk of CIN, but, in most cases, small amounts of IV contrast
are still required to attain sufficiently detailed images.
Three therapeutic options for TRAS are pharmacological
therapy alone or pharmacologic therapy in addition to renal
artery angioplasty with stenting or surgical revascularization (90).
For pharmacological therapy, the pathophysiology of TRAS is
similar to that of bilateral RAS in the non-transplant population.
A decrease in renal blood flow to a transplant renal allograft
causes increased RAAS activation resulting in salt and water
retention and subsequent HTN. ACEI or ARB plus diuretics
are a likely effective regimen for BP control. However, this
pharmacologic therapy is limited by decreasing renal function
resulting from decreases in systemic BP leading to reduced renal
perfusion and intraglomerular pressure below the limitation
of autoregulation. This increases efferent arteriolar resistance
mediated by angiotensin II. By blocking the action of angiotensin
II, autoregulation is blunted, and GFR is reduced (95). Volume
depletion from diuretics may also contribute to rising serum
creatinine in these instances. For this reason, it is not common
to utilize RAAS and/or diuretics during early post-transplant
period. Once baseline renal allograft function is established,
however, and there are no contraindications for RAAS and/or
diuretics, such as rising serum creatinine, hyperkalemia, or
volume depletion, medical therapy may be utilized to control
blood pressure (79). Statins and acetylsalicylic acid may also
be part of pharmacological therapy although there is no clear
evidence for these use specifically in TRAS (79).
Patients with worsening serum creatinine and/or uncontrolled
HTN attributable to TRAS should undergo renal artery
angioplasty with stenting. There is no randomized controlled
clinical trial (RCT) comparing the efficacy of angioplasty
± stenting vs. surgical revascularization vs. pharmacological
therapy alone in the kidney transplant population. Data from
non-transplant patients from 4 RCT (96–99) did not show
the benefit of angioplasty on BP control, and 4 RCT (97, 99–
101) did not demonstrate better renal outcomes. However,
several observational studies demonstrate highly successful both
technical and clinical outcomes (88–100 and 65–94%) with varied
procedure-related complications (0–25.5%) in kidney transplant
recipients (102–105). Long-term renal allograft and patient
survival with up to 21 years of follow-up is not different between
patient with TRAS undergoing percutaneous angioplasty or stent
placement and patients that without TRAS (105). A single study
showed that both immediate and long-term success rate were
lower in angioplasty compared to surgical revascularization;
however, the former was still a preferred procedure when TRAS
is recent, linear, and distal. Whereas, surgical revascularization
is performed primarily in individuals with kinking and proximal
TRAS (106). There are several surgical techniques, including
resection and revision of the anastomosis, saphenous vein bypass
graft of the stenotic segment, localized endarterectomy, and
excision/reimplantation of the renal artery (90, 107). Generally,
surgical revascularization is reserved for cases of unsuccessful
angioplasty. Long-term renal allograft function and survival with
a mean follow-up of 9.8 ± 2.1 years has demonstrated the efficacy
and safety of surgical revascularization (108).
Late Post-transplant Period
Apart from the above-discussed factors contributing to HTN in
the early post-transplant period, some factors may contribute to
HTN in the late post-transplant period.
Chronic Renal Allograft Dysfunction
A causal relationship between chronic renal allograft dysfunction
and HTN has not been proven but follows on from a logical
examination of pathophysiology. Renal allograft injury—both
acute and chronic—is associated with HTN. Common causes
of renal allograft injury include acute allograft rejection—both
acute antibody-mediated—and acute cellular rejection. Chronic
renal allograft injury results from persistent antibody-mediated
rejection, interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy, thrombotic
microangiopathy, and recurrent glomerular disease in the renal

Tantisattamo et al. Approach and Management Post-KTx HTN
allograft (19). An animal study in rats showed that HTN alone led
to chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN). This study utilized rats
with deoxycorticosterone acetate and salt-induced hypertension
and compared them to normotensive rats. The hypertensive
rats had higher proteinuria, smooth muscle cell-growth factors,
platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), tubular cell expression of
proliferating cell nuclear antigen, extracellular matrix deposition,
and presence of class I and II major histocompatibility complex
(MHC). This suggests that HTN and immunologic factors affect
the expression of growth factors in renal allografts and may be
the cause of chronic renal allograft dysfunction (109).
Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) 23
After kidney transplantation, FGF23 levels decrease. The rate at
which FGF23 levels normalize after transplantation is dependent
on shorter dialysis vintage before kidney transplantation and
the time to normalization of renal allograft function including
mineral metabolism (110, 111). FGF 23 is a known independent
risk factor of renal allograft loss, cardiovascular and allcause mortality in kidney transplant recipients (112, 113). The
relationship of FGF 23 levels in the pre- and post-kidney
transplant period to BP level or development of HTN after kidney
transplantation is unknown. However, given that a higher level
of FGF23 is associated with increased SBP and DBP as well as an
incident HTN in 1,758 non-hypertensive young adults without
CKD or CVD (114), this association may hold true for the
transplant population. Despite this, further studies are necessary.
Obstructive Sleep Apnea
Prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in kidney transplant
recipients varies with the severity of OSA. The prevalence of
mild, moderate, and severe OSA in kidney transplant recipients
participating in Sleep disorders Evaluation in Patients after
kidney Transplantation (SLEPT) Study who had a mean eGFR
of 52 ± 19 ml/min/1.73 m2 was 18, 11, and 14%, respectively.
In this study, kidney transplant patients with OSA required
a significantly higher number of antihypertensive medications
and tended to have higher SBP as compared to non-OSA
patients (115).
Similar to the non-transplant population, risk factors for OSA
in kidney transplant recipients are male gender, obesity, use
of hypnotic drugs, presence of severe comorbidity (e.g., heart
disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease,
diabetes mellitus), and impaired kidney function (116). There
is a relationship between HTN, CKD, and OSA, and they have
common risk factors and pathophysiology, including increased
sympathetic activity, endothelial dysfunction, increased
inflammatory markers, hyperaldosteronism, and chronic volume
overload. In addition, these three conditions are associated with
CV risks, morbidity, and mortality (117). If any of these three
diseases is uncontrolled or progress the other two conditions
tend to worsen or become more difficult to manage. Therefore,
appropriate management of OSA is an essential component of
the antihypertensive therapy in kidney transplant recipients who
later develop renal allograft dysfunction especially with resistant
HTN. Moreover, kidney transplant recipients who have risk
factors for OSA should undergo early screening (115, 118) and
be appropriately treated.
In summary, the pathogenesis of post-transplant HTN may
be categorized by the time period during which hypertension
develops after kidney transplantation. Another approach to
differentiate the etiologies of post-transplant HTN is by dividing
the causes into immunological and non-immunological factors.
Immunological factors, as discussed, mainly include renal
allograft dysfunction and immunosuppressive medications; while
non-immunological factors involve the donor, recipient, and
surgical related factors (Figure 3).
OUTCOMES OF HYPERTENSION AFTER
KIDNEY TRANSPLANTATION
Pre-transplant BP is associated with renal allograft and patient
survival outcomes after kidney transplantation. Very low pretransplant SBP (<110 mmHg) and DBP (<50 mmHg) are
associated with a decrease in renal allograft loss. Specifically
during dialysis lower pre- and post-dialysis DBP are associated
with better patient survival post-transplantation (119).
During the post-transplant period, elevated BP is associated
with poorer renal allograft and patient outcomes. However,
as discussed above, various forms of renal allograft injury
are also associated with post-transplant HTN. Several studies
have demonstrated an association between post-transplant
HTN and renal allograft failure (120–122). Opelz et al. (120)
conducted a retrospective study of 29,751 kidney transplant
recipients followed for over 7 years. Increased post-transplant
SBP and DBP were associated with progressively decreased
renal allograft function and death-censored chronic graft failure.
Another study from the same cohort database examined the
association between changes in BP levels at 1- and 3-years
post-transplantation and long-term graft outcomes up to 10
years following transplantation. They found that patients with
a SBP >140 mmHg at 1 year who were controlled to a SBP
≤140 mmHg at 3 years post-transplantation had improved renal
allograft outcomes and reduced CV death compared to those
with persistent SBP of >140 mmHg both at 1 and 3 years
post-transplantation (123).
There is insufficient information about CV and mortality
outcomes related to isolated diastolic HTN in kidney transplant
recipients, and more studies are required to determine
appropriate management targets for isolated diastolic HTN
in this population.
Cardiovascular Outcomes-Related to Post-transplant
Hypertension
HTN is one of the most important risk factors for heart
failure, particularly heart failure with preserved ejection fraction
(HFpEF) (124). Kidney transplant recipients with left ventricular
hypertrophy (LVH) or HFpEF have increased morbidity and
mortality and are at high risk for cardiac-related events. Both
pressure and volume overload contributed to LVH, which is
further exacerbated by age, genetic factors, vascular hemodialysis
access, dialysis vintage, diabetes, and blood pressure (125).

graft function; HTN, hypertension; KTx, kidney transplantation; OSA, obstructive sleep; TRAS, transplant renal artery stenosis.
Renal insufficiency is involved in the pathogenesis of HFpEF
(126) and causes salt-sensitive HTN (126, 127). Importantly, a
vicious cycle of cardio-renal dysfunction can result from salt
and volume overload (126). Therefore, BP control, renal allograft
function, and heart function are closely related. Uncontrolled
HTN after kidney transplantation leads to structural damage
to both the renal allograft and heart eventually resulting in
decreased renal and cardiac functions.
BLOOD PRESSURE MEASUREMENT
BP is one of the most common vital signs obtained in all
clinical settings; however, it may frequently be unreliable due to
variation of physiologic response to internal and external stimuli
as well as inappropriate BP measurement techniques. Reliable
BP measurement should be mandatory in clinical practice and
can be standardized with the following definitions: the mean
of three non-invasive BP measurements is referred to as office
blood pressure (OBP); recording at least twice the daily average
of two home blood pressure readings over a minimum of 4 days is
referred to as home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM), and 24-
h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (24-h ABPM), which
requires wearing an electronic blood pressure measurement
device to record and averages multiple readings over a 24 h
period (128). Purpose, clinical context, and practicality should
be taken into consideration when selecting the appropriate BP
measurement methods. The different BP measurement methods
provide different information, which can be useful for sorting
out the pathophysiology of post-transplant HTN. It is important
to be knowledgeable about the different definitions for HTN
with each method in order to appropriately manage BP after
kidney transplantation.
A 24-h ABPM provides the average of both day and night
BP readings. Physiological decreases in nocturnal BP further
classifies patients into dippers, non-dippers, and reverse dippers.
Lee et al. (129) demonstrated a significant decrease in the
nocturnal reduction in SBP (1SBP) after kidney transplantation.
In addition, decrease in 1SBP was associated with a lower
renal allograft function. In this study, the mean OBP and
24-h ABPM did not change at 1-year post-transplantation
when compared to the BP measurements before kidney
transplantation. However, they found that the proportion of
patients who took antihypertensive medications and the numbers
of antihypertensive medications required were significantly
decreased after kidney transplantation.
A 24-h ABPM can address and assist with the common
misclassification of HTN diagnosed traditionally by OBP or
HBPM. Compared with OBP, a 24-h ABPM led to 61%
disagreement in diagnosis (58% and 3% due to masked and
white-coat HTN, respectively) (130).
Although a 24-h ABPM can provide useful information to
diagnose patterns of HTN like white coat and masked HTN, OBP
and HBPM are more commonly used in clinical practice. Since
transplant renal allografts are very sensitive to BP hemodynamic
changes, HBPM appears to be a common utilized method of
following BP after kidney transplantation. One study in patients
Frontiers in Medicine | www.frontiersin.org 9 June 2020 | Volume 7 | Article 229

Tantisattamo et al. Approach and Management Post-KTx HTN
who were 1–10 years after kidney transplantation revealed a
higher correlation between a 24-h ABPM and HBPM than 24-h
ABPM and OBP (131).
Though elevations in both day and night SBP obtained from
24-h ABPM were associated with risk of declining renal allograft
function, and nighttime elevation in SBP exhibited a stronger
association (132). An elevated 24-h average SBP was significantly
associated with a composite endpoint of graft loss, cardiovascular
events and death over a 5-year follow-up period in kidney
transplant recipients with diabetes, lower eGFR, proteinuria,
young age, and who were female (133). An average (day and
night) 24-h DBP between 65 and 80 mmHg was associated with
greater long term survival during a 9-year follow-up period after
kidney transplantation when compared to those who had average
DBP <65 or >80 mmHg (134).
Although HBPM is widely available, better correlated to
24-h ABPM, and superior to OBP when predicting hard
outcomes, we used HBPM in conjunction with OBP for our
kidney transplant patients to minimize misclassification of HTN
diagnosis, monitor possible white coat or masked HTN, and
adjust antihypertensive medications.
BLOOD PRESSURE MANAGEMENT
Non-pharmacologic interventions, such as diet, exercise, and
stress reduction, should always be part of treatment of
HTN. Since the majority of kidney transplant recipients have
pre-transplant HTN requiring antihypertensive medications
(persistent HTN) and only small number of patients become
normotensive without blood pressure medications (recovered
HTN), pharmacological intervention remains the cornerstone of
BP control in this population. Additionally, other interventions
specific to certain etiologies of resistant HTN, such as transplant
renal artery angioplasty ± stenting and treatment for OSA,
should be implemented. Renal sympathetic denervation of the
native kidneys either by bilateral native nephrectomy or catheter
ablation is also treatment option for resistant HTN in this
population (Table 2). In this review, we focus on antihypertensive
medications and briefly review bilateral native nephrectomy and
RDN of native kidneys.
PHARMACOLOGICAL MANAGEMENTS
Use of Antihypertensive Medications
A recent retrospective cross-sectional analysis from a single
transplant center in Poland reported the trend of commonly
used antihypertensive medications in their kidney transplant
recipients over 14 years. They examined antihypertensive therapy
data from transplant recipients first outpatient visits from 2001,
2006, 2011, and 2014 (135). Beta-blockers were the most common
antihypertensive medication used in this cohort followed by
calcium channel blockers. Uses of ACEI, diuretics, and alphablockers were about the same. ARB therapy was utilized least.
The average number of antihypertensive medications required
was reported to be 2.24 ± 1.03–2.55 ± 1.25. This is slightly
lower than what has been reported for CKD patients who on
average require 3.5 medications (136). The lower number of

BLOOD PRESSURE CONTROL DURING
PERI-TRANSPLANT PERIOD
Antihypertensive Medications
The majority of advanced CKD and ESRD patients have HTN.
Volume overload is the most common cause of uncontrolled
BP in ESRD patients (137). In the immediate pre-transplant
period, particularly in deceased donor renal transplantation
when surgeries are often performed emergently (138), BP can
be uncontrolled particularly if the patient was due for dialysis at
the time of surgery. Volume-dependent HTN is managed with
fluid removal during dialysis. However, it is common practice
to remove less fluid from patients who are about to undergo
transplant, leaving them with a post-dialysis weight slightly above
their established dry weight in an effort to avoid intra- and
post-operative hypotension. Additionally, ACEI and ARB are
generally held following a transplant. An alpha2 agonist like
clonidine, however, may need to be continued during peritransplant period to avoid rebound HTN.
Providers taking care of kidney transplant recipients have
different opinions when selecting antihypertensive medications
during peri- and post-transplant period. Their decision may
Frontiers in Medicine | www.frontiersin.org 10 June 2020 | Volume 7 | Article 229

Tantisattamo et al. Approach and Management Post-KTx HTN
mainly be driven by protocols or common practices followed
at their kidney transplant centers. Specific information relevant
to kidney transplantation should guide the selection of
antihypertensive medications, but, as in other scenarios, it is
rational to individualize BP management for certain kidney
transplant recipients.
Diuretics
Diuretics are not commonly used as the first line antihypertensive
medication in kidney transplant recipients. They may cause
volume depletion, electrolyte disturbances, and worsening renal
allograft function. However, they are indicated and should not be
avoided in certain patients in the peri-transplant period.
Loop Diuretics
Volume control rather than BP control is the indication
for loop diuretics in kidney transplant recipients, especially
during immediate and early post-transplant periods. Kidney
transplant recipients generally receive peri-transplant IV
fluid to keep up with an increased urine output from a new
functioning renal allograft. Volume overload presenting
with peripheral edema, pulmonary congestion, or HTN
may occur when the establishment allograft function
lags behind the volume resuscitation provided. Diuretics
can be used to control both volume and BP in this
common scenario.
There is also evidences that loop diuretics have a vasodilator
effect and can decrease edema, congestion, and oxygen
requirements. Theoretically they can decrease ischemic renal
injury and risk of DGF in kidney transplant recipients. However,
despite their common use in clinical practice, there is no
consistent data to support using loop diuretic to increase urine
output and prevent DGF. In addition, there is no strong evidence
showing an association between loop diuretic and improvement
in initial or long-term graft function (139). On the other
hand, loop diuretic use has been associated with increased risk
of UTI during the first 5 years after kidney transplantation
(140). This is because there use depletes medullary NaCl
gradient (140), which is known to modulate the adaptive
and innate immune response (141). Renal medullary myeloid
mononuclear cell phagocytes are classified as pro-inflammatory
(M1) and reparative/profibrotic (M2) cells. Decreasing M1/M2
ratio from altering renal medullary NaCl gradient with loop
diuretics impairs the natural antibacterial host response (142–
144).
Furosemide is the most commonly used loop diuretic. It has
been used to predicting progression of AKI with the so-called
furosemide stress test (FST) in non-transplant patients (145, 146).
Loop diuretics can also provide prognostic value in regard to
renal allograft function in the immediate post-transplant period.
An inadequate response, urine output <350 ml within 4 h, to
a single IV furosemide dose of 1.5 mg/kg given 3 h after renal
allograft anastomosis predicts increased risk of DGF (146).
Given the wide range of risks and benefits with loop diuretics,
clinicians should individualize their use in transplant recipients.
Additional RCTs are required to determine the efficacy and safety
of loop diuretic in kidney transplant recipients.
Thiazides
Thiazide diuretics are commonly used antihypertensives
in general population. They are however uncommon in
the management of kidney transplant recipients because of
their metabolic side effects which include hyperglycemia,
hyperuricemia, hypercalcemia, and hyponatremia (147, 148).
Thiazides however, may theoretically control CNI-induced
HTN. Since CNI-induced HTN is salt sensitive (59, 149) via
activation of the WNK-SPAK-NCC pathway (63, 150), thiazides,
which inhibit Na-Cl co-transporter, should control CNI-induced
HTN. A randomized non-inferiority crossover trial comparing
the effects of chlorthalidone and amlodipine in kidney transplant
recipients taking tacrolimus showed that chlorthalidone was
not inferior to amlodipine in controlling BP (147). Given
the vasodilator effect of calcium channel blockers, they are
commonly used antihypertensives in kidney transplant recipients
intended to counteract the systemic and renal vasoconstrictive
effect of CNI via endothelin I (151–153). However, their side
effects, including peripheral edema and proteinuria, may make
thiazides a suitable alternative for BP control particularly in
individuals with peripheral edema (147).
Although loop diuretics are generally favored over thiazide
diuretic for volume control, they can lead to additional
renal magnesium wasting. Thiazides can be considered in
transplant patients who already have other reasons for and
often struggle with hypomagnesemia. However, because CNI
and loop diuretics act on the common mechanism to lower
luminal electro-positivity decreasing paracellular magnesium
reabsorption, using a loop diuretic in concert with CNI
may not cause further urinary magnesium loss (154). A
retrospective study in heart transplant recipients taking CNI
showed that the group receiving loop diuretic did not have
lower serum magnesium levels or require higher magnesium
supplementation compared to the group not receiving loop
diuretics (154). Thiazide diuretics, on the other hand, increase
serum magnesium when used with CNI. In non-transplant
patients without CNI, acute thiazide diuretic use results in
increased magnesium reabsorption. However, long-term thiazide
diuretic use can result in urinary magnesium wasting when
there is concomitant hypokalemia (154). Transplant recipients
on CNIs commonly have hyperkalemia, and, therefore, thiazide
diuretics may not worsen hypomagnesemia from CNI but
instead increase magnesium levels. The previously mentioned
study demonstrated that heart transplant recipients receiving
thiazide diuretics had higher serum magnesium level and
required less magnesium replacement compared to those not on
thiazides (154). Therefore, in the setting of volume overload and
concomitant hypomagnesemia, thiazide diuretic may be used to
mitigate the hypomagnesemic effect of CNI therapy (154).
Thiazides may be considered for kidney transplant recipients
with CNI-induced salt-sensitive HTN and hypomagnesemia.
Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists
Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MCRA) have CV
benefits (155, 156) and antiproteinuric effect but are not
commonly used antihypertensives in kidney transplant
recipients, especially those with impaired renal allograft

Tantisattamo et al. Approach and Management Post-KTx HTN
function. Hyperkalemia is a common side effects of MCRA
and it may be worse in kidney transplant recipients who have
CNI-induced hyperkalemia.
One pilot study evaluating the antiproteinuric effect of
spironolactone 25 mg/day given to 11 kidney transplant
recipients whose mean proteinuria was 4.4 ± 1.4 g/day on both
ACEI and ARB. Proteinuria was decreased more than 50% with
a mean reduction of 85% in nine patients after 6 months on
spironolactone. Renal allograft function slightly decreased with
GFR, changing from 52 ± 12.7 to 48 ± 14.2 mg/dL, and serum
potassium did not significantly increase (4.6 ± 0.4–5 ± 0.62
mEq/L) (157). Another study looked at the safety of eplerenone
in kidney transplant recipients with eGFR between 30 and 50
mL/min/ 1.73 m2. After 8 weeks of eplerenone 25 mg/d, nine
out of 31 patients had serum potassium of >5 mmol/l, and one
patient had serum potassium of >5.5 mmol/l. Mean baseline
eGFR was 41 (26–59) ml/min/1.73 m2after 8 week of eplerenone
therapy and was not significantly different between patients who
did and did not develop hyperkalemia (36.0 [95% CI 26.0–53.0]
vs. 44.5 [95% CI 26.0–59.0], p = 0.17). Having a baseline serum
potassium >4.35 mmol/l was associated with increased serum
potassium of >5 mmol/l once starting eplerenone (158).
CNIs can cause vascular vasoconstriction via activation of
mineralocorticoid receptor in smooth muscle leading to impaired
renal allograft function. MCRAs bind mineralocorticoid
receptors in principle cells of collecting ducts and are potentially
reno-protective by blunting the renal vascular resistance induced
by CNI therapy (159).
Spironolactone decreases cardiac left ventricular volume and
mass, but studies are required to determine its effect in kidney
transplant recipients (160). In addition, there is a lack of
evidence in terms of CV and mortality benefits in kidney
transplant recipients.
With some evidence for antiproteinuric effect and their
established safety in transplant recipients even when in
combination with ACEI or ARB, MCRA may be a new
option for BP control in individual with CNI-induced HTN
and proteinuria.
Beta-Blockers
The cardioprotective effects and survival benefit of beta-blockers
make them a favored medication in the general (161) and
ESRD populations (162–165). In kidney transplant recipients, a
recent retrospective study from 2001 to 2014 showed that betablockers are the most common used antihypertensive medication
(135). In addition, Aftab et al. (166) conducted a single center
retrospective study in 321 kidney transplant recipients over a
10 ± 4 year follow-up period and found that those who took
beta-blockers had a significant survival advantage compared to
those who did not. Moreover, the authors showed that betablocker has additive effect on ACEI or ARB with greater survival
in kidney transplant patients on this combination compared
to those who received either medication alone or neither. The
possible protective mechanism of beta-blocker is via mitigation
of the sympathetic nervous system, which is stimulated in failed
native kidneys (167–169). In addition, beta-blockers decrease
proinflammatory cytokines, which are known to increase the risk
for atherosclerosis (170).
Although beta-blockers provide survival benefit in
kidney transplant recipients, they can cause metabolic side
effects, including proteinuria, hyperkalemia, and masking of
hypoglycemic symptoms. Therefore, caution should be used
when using beta blockers in kidney transplant recipients who are
at risk to develop these side effects.
Calcium Channel Blockers
Calcium channel blockers inhibit entry of calcium into vascular
smooth muscle cells, resulting in vascular vasodilation (171).
Since the vasoconstrictive effect of CNIs leads to post-transplant
HTN (172), calcium channel blockers are thought to be an
appropriate agent for post-transplant HTN. Theoretically their
vasodilatory effect can counteract the vasoconstrictive effect of
CNIs and improve BP control (171, 173, 174).
In addition to blood pressure control, calcium channel
blockers also prevent post-transplant acute tubular injury (ATI)
or DGF. One prospective trial looked at diltiazem use in
patients who received deceased donor renal transplantation
(DDRT). Participants were randomized to kidneys that had
been given diltiazem (Euro-collin’s solution (20 mg/l) at time
donor nephrectomy; meanwhile, the recipients received a bolus
injection of diltiazem (0.28 mg/kg) pre-operatively followed by
an infusion 0.0022 mg/min/kg for 2 days before transitioning to
oral diltiazem vs. a control group, which did not receive diltiazem
but otherwise received the same induction immunosuppression
regimen with CsA. The diltiazem group had lower incidence of
ATI, higher GFR with primary function, and lower incidences of
rejection at 1 month post-transplant. They however had higher
CsA level compared to control group. The total CsA required was
lower in the diltiazem group, as might be expected, to achieve
comparable CsA levels between the two groups. The lower posttransplant ATI in the diltiazem group was postulated to be
secondary to lower ischemic damage in the renal allograft and
reduced CNI nephrotoxicity (175). A Cochran review of 13 trials
with a total of 724 participants also concluded that peri-operative
calcium channel blocker significantly decreased incidence of
post-transplant ATI and DGF. There was no difference in graft
loss, mortality, or requirement for hemodialysis, but there was
insufficient evidence to draw conclusions regarding adverse drug
reactions (176). There was another randomized placebo control
study comparing renal allograft outcomes between patients who
received pre-transplant isradipine vs. those who received a
placebo. The former group had greater renal allograft function
as compared to the latter. However, the rate of DGF and biopsyproven acute rejection was not different in this study (177).
Although calcium channel blockers provide better renal
allograft function, several studies showed no difference in terms
of BP control when using verapamil compared to enalapril or
doxazosin (178). No difference in GFR, serum creatinine level,
protein excretion, or BP when nitrendipine or nifedipine was
compared to the placebo (179). Moreover, one retrospective
study showed 2.26 time greater risk of ischemic heart disease
in kidney transplant recipients who received dihydropyridine
calcium channel blockers (180).

Tantisattamo et al. Approach and Management Post-KTx HTN
The evidence for the benefits of calcium channel blockers
appears inconsistent; however, a recent systematic review and
meta-analysis of 60 trials including 3,802 patients showed that,
compared to placebo or no treatment, calcium channel blockers
decreased graft loss [risk ratio (RR) of 0.75, 95% confidence
intervals (CI) 0.57–0.99] and increased GFR [mean difference
(MD) 4.5 mL/min, 95% CI 2.2–6.7]. Compared to ACEIs,
patients treated with calcium channel blockers tend to have
a higher GFR; although there is inconclusive data regarding
graft loss between these two groups (181). Given the available
information, calcium channel blockers remain a preferred
antihypertensive agent for kidney transplant recipients barring
there are no specific indications for other antihypertensive agents
or contraindications to calcium channel blocker therapy.
Adverse drug reactions and drug–drug interaction between
calcium channel blockers and other commonly used medications
should be taken into consideration. Calcium channel blockers
can result in peripheral edema and muscle weakness especially
when used in combination with steroids. Gum hyperplasia is also
more common when calcium channel blockers are used with CsA
(171). Although dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers do
not inhibit the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 isoenzyme, they are
metabolized by a CYP3A4 isoenzyme and can compete with CNI.
This leads to increase in both calcium channel blocker and CNI
exposure levels. Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers
inhibit CYP3A4 isoenzyme and significantly increase CNI level.
Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors
(ACEI) and Angiotensin II Receptor
Blockers (ARB)
Since proteinuria is a surrogate marker for renal disease, lowering
proteinuria is one strategy to slow the progression of CKD.
ACEIs and ARBs are antihypertensive agents with known
antiproteinuric effect. ACEIs inhibit angiotensin-converting
enzyme, which converts renin to angiotensin. ARBs act on
angiotensin II receptors and subsequently inhibit RAAS pathway.
A systematic review and meta-analysis of 21 clinical trials,
including 1,549 patients, revealed no difference in the MAP
change between ACEI or ARB group and the control group.
Serum potassium was also not different between the two groups.
However, the ACEI or ARB group had a decrease in proteinuria,
eGFR, and hematocrit when compared to the control group.
There was insufficient data regarding the benefits of ACEI or ARB
therapy in terms of patient or renal allograft survival (182). In
the aforementioned systematic review and meta-analysis, eGFR
in the ACEI group was not different from that in the placebo
group but was lower than the calcium channel blocker group.
A comparison of data regarding graft loss between ACEI and
calcium channel blocker therapy was inconclusive (181).
RAAS activation is associated with interstitial fibrosis and
tubular atrophy (IF/TA), one of the most common causes of
renal allograft loss (183, 184). The ACEI perindopril was shown
to prevent cortical interstitial expansion, a marker of fibrosis in
CKD patients with biopsy-proven diabetic nephropathy (185).
One RCT in kidney transplant recipients who received losartan
100 mg daily within 3 months post-transplant and continued it
for 5 years compared to matched placebo controls did not show
a benefit of ARB therapy in terms of reduction in a composite
interstitial expansion or ESRD from IF/TA (186).
ACEIs and ARBs can lead to regression of LVH in kidney
transplant recipients (187, 188), but these same studies did
not demonstrate an improvement in all-cause mortality (189).
A recent systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated
a survival benefit with ACEI or ARB therapy in kidney
transplant recipients but only from pooled cohort studies and not
RCTs (190).
Although ACEIs and ARBs provide antiproteinuric effect,
they are generally not the drugs of choice during the immediate
and early post-transplant periods. This is mainly because they
are known to decrease GFR. This side effect is reversible,
but it leads to a confusion early on differentiating their role
from other causes of renal allograft dysfunction and may lead
to unnecessary workups, including invasive investigation, e.g.,
transplant renal biopsy.
While there is no robust evidence for CV or survival
advantages with the use of ACEIs, ARBs, and MCRAs, these
antihypertensive medications may be considered. They may be
considered in transplant recipients, particularly those with LVH,
congestive heart failure, and proteinuria.
Alpha1-Antagonists
Alpha1-antagonists are rarely used as the initial or as a single
antihypertensive agent in kidney transplant recipients. Although
they reduce BP by decreasing peripheral vasoconstriction and
theoretically should counteract with vasoconstrictive effect of
CNI, there is no evidence that alpha1-antagonists provide
superior antihypertensive effect or slows progression of renal
allograft dysfunction when compared to other antihypertensive
medications. A study with long-term follow up in 88 hypertensive
kidney transplant recipients who were divided into three
groups, verapamil, enalapril, and doxazosin, demonstrated
that doxazosin provided the same efficacy in BP control
compared with the others while maintaining an excellent safety
profile. However, up to 38% of patients in the doxazosin
group needed additional antihypertensive medications compared
to only 8 and 13% in verapamil and enalapril groups,
respectively (178). Alpha1-antagonist may have a role as an
adjunctive therapy rather than first line antihypertensive agent
in transplant recipients.
Alpha2 Agonists
Centrally acting alpha2 agonists work on presynaptic alpha2
adrenoceptors in the central nervous system and suppress central
sympathetic activity (191). Specifically, activation of alpha2A
receptors causes a sympatho-inhibitory effect and lowers BP.
However, stimulating alpha2A receptors in blood vessels causes
a peripheral vasoconstriction (192). On the other hand, alpha2B
receptor activation leads to a sympatho-excitatory effect (192).
Two of the oldest alpha2 agonists, methyldopa and clonidine,
have long been used for BP control (193). Clonidine is
currently the most commonly used alpha2 agonist. When used
as monotherapy, methyldopa is associated with antihypertensive
tolerance, edema, and weight gain. Clonidine is also associated
with weight gain and progressive resistance with continued use.
Chronic use is not associated with sodium and water retention or
Frontiers in Medicine | www.frontiersin.org 13 June 2020 | Volume 7 | Article 229

Tantisattamo et al. Approach and Management Post-KTx HTN
body fluid volume expansion (193). It instead causes a decrease
in exchangeable body sodium and plasma volume, which may be
another antihypertensive mechanism of clonidine (194).
Similar to other groups of antihypertensive medications,
clonidine has an effect on renal hemodynamics and lowers
renal vascular resistance. A study in 13 essential hypertensive
patients who received long-term clonidine showed that it lowered
plasma renin activity, modulated renal vascular resistance,
and subsequently lowered MAP (195). A study of the effect
of clonidine on renal hemodynamics was conducted in six
kidney transplant recipients who initially received furosemide
for 2 weeks before the addition of clonidine titrated to
BP control found that GFR and effective renal plasma flow
measured by inulin and amino-hippurate sodium clearances was
unchanged (196).
Clonidine is an effective antihypertensive medication. Many
ESRD patients who are on kidney transplant waiting lists have
uncontrolled HTN and are on clonidine in addition to their
other antihypertensive agents. However, as previously discussed,
rebound HTN is common after discontinuation of clonidine,
and patients who are on clonidine prior to kidney transplant
tend to have uncontrolled HTN resulting from this rebound
phenomenon. In these patients, clonidine is often re-started and
be tapered off during early post-transplant period. Therefore,
clonidine is rarely used as a single antihypertensive agent
following kidney transplantation.
In summary, there is no drug of choice for BP control
after kidney transplantation. Several factors are involved in
selecting the appropriate antihypertensive medications include
immunologic and non-immunologic factors as well as the time
after kidney transplantation.
Different from the non-transplant CKD population, betablockers and calcium channel blockers are the most frequently
used combination in kidney transplant recipients. Beta-blockers
provide a cardioprotective effect for kidney transplant patients,
who likely have underlying CAD (166). Calcium channel blockers
have vasodilatory effect that counteracts the vasoconstrictive
effect of CNIs (197). ACEIs and ARBs, on the other hand,
are not routinely used antihypertensive medications in kidney
transplant recipients. This is especially true during the early
post-transplant period when baseline renal allograft function is
not well-established. They can, however, be considered when
there is a specific indication for their use, such as proteinuria
and posttransplant erythrocytosis. Rising serum creatinine from
ACEI or ARB therapy, although reversible, is the main reason
they are avoid. This change is serum creatinine can be difficult
to differentiate from other causes of worsening renal allograft
function, particularly acute renal allograft rejection, leading to
unnecessary workups and possibly unnecessary renal allograft
biopsies. Similarly to ACEIs and ARBs, diuretics are not generally
used as the first line for BP control in kidney transplant
recipients. It may be used for volume control at immediate or
early post-transplant.
From the characteristics, clinical outcomes, and side effect
profiles of antihypertensive medications, we routinely use
dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and/or beta-blockers
as first-line antihypertensive medications. Since the majority of
patients do not achieve BP control during the immediate or
early post-transplant period, the combination of dihydropyridine
channel blockers with beta-blockers is commonly used in our
transplant center. Once renal allograft function is established
and stable, we consider adding or replacing ACEI or ARB
for dihydropyridine channel blockers and beta-blockers if
there are appropriate indications, such as proteinuria or posttransplant polycythemia.
Table 3 summarizes characteristics of the most commonly
used antihypertensive medications and rationales for selecting
each BP medication in kidney transplant recipients (154, 175,
176, 198–204).
BLOOD PRESSURE GUIDELINE FOR
KIDNEY TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS
BP targets have been a controversial topic not only in the nontransplant population but also in kidney transplant recipients.
Several professional societies from different countries have
created clinical practice guidelines with some similarities and
differences (Table 4) (26, 27, 205–212).
Until there is strong clinical outcome evidence in terms
of CV, patients, or renal allograft survival, BP targets should
be individualized, taking into account immunologic and nonimmunologic factors that are contributing to HTN in each kidney
transplant recipient.
OTHER MANAGEMENT FOR BLOOD
PRESSURE
Native Nephrectomy
In ESRD patients with resistant HTN, defined as uncontrolled
BP with at least three antihypertensive medications of which one
is a diuretic, secondary HTN should be considered. Apart from
renovascular and hormonal causes of secondary HTN, failed
kidneys can contribute to HTN or be the cause of uncontrolled
HTN in ESRD patients. In ESRD secondary to ADPKD, the
mechanism of HTN from failed kidneys is related to intrarenal renin instead of systemic renin (213, 214). In kidney
transplantation, the presence of failed native kidneys is associated
with post-transplant resistant HTN. This is presumed in part
related to the effect of angiotensin II (215). In these kidney
transplant recipients with resistant HTN, ACEIs and native
nephrectomy may need to be considered.
There is evidence that kidney transplant recipients with preor post-transplant native nephrectomy have decreased BP when
compared to those without native nephrectomy (Table 5) (216–
221). The majority of these studies were notably conducted in
patients with ADPKD as the cause of ESRD.
Native Renal Sympathetic Denervation
Apart from the angiotensin II pathway, sympathetic overactivity
from failed native kidneys is another mechanism that leads to
resistant HTN. Renal and systemic sympathetic hyperactivity
contributes to the pathophysiology of resistant HTN. The effect
of RDN on BP control was established (222). In kidney transplant

Surgical Renal Denervation by Bilateral
Native Nephrectomy
Complete RDN can be performed by bilateral native
nephrectomy. A retrospective study in 32 kidney transplant
recipients undergoing pre-transplant bilateral native
nephrectomy revealed lower SBP, a number of antihypertensive
medications, left ventricular mass index, and left atrial
volume index but higher left ventricular diastolic dysfunction
compared to a matched (age, gender, creatinine levels, eGFR,

therapy) control group (221). This data supports the effect of
RDN as treatment options for HTN in this population.

Although native nephrectomy can improve posttransplant HTN, both pre- and post-transplant native
nephrectomy can lead to surgical complications, which
can cause impaired renal allograft function. Therefore,
native nephrectomy for the purpose of BP control in
kidney transplant recipients should be performed in select
patients with severely uncontrolled post-transplant HTN
whom, without treatment, would have deterioration of
renal allograft function or be at increased risk of CV
complications. Patients who undergo bilateral native
nephrectomy for alternative indications such as recurrent
infection, discomfort from large polycystic kidneys, or suspicious
native renal tumors may have the added benefit of improved
BP control.
Catheter Ablative Renal Denervation
Partial reinnervation of the human transplanted kidney has
been shown histologically. Axonal regeneration in a human
transplant kidney started at 28 days to 5 months post-kidney
transplantation and was complete within 8–12 months to 2
years (224, 225). The function of efferent renal nerves that
reinnervate transplanted renal arteries, however, may not be
the same as what occurs in native renal nerves (226, 227).
One study of renal hemodynamics, sodium excretion, and
tubular function after noradrenaline infusion (2 µg h−1 kg−1)
and lower body negative pressure (−27 mmHg) in 25 kidney
transplant recipients and 10 normal subjects concluded that the
reinnervated efferent renal nerves in the human transplanted
kidney are still essentially functionally denervated (228). Since

complete RDN by bilateral native nephrectomy in kidney
transplant recipients is invasive and carries a risk of additional
operation, native RDN is another option, and it should be
reserved for selected patients.
Two reported kidney transplant recipients with resistant HTN
had improved BP control after RDN of native kidneys (229,
230). An investigator-initiated, prospective, single-center RCT
with 6-month follow-up of 18 kidney transplant recipients with
resistant HTN compared the feasibility and efficacy of renal
sympathetic denervation as compared to medical therapy alone.
The former group had a significantly decreased office SBP of
23.3 ± 14.5 mmHg and a higher proportion of patients who
converted from non-dippers to dippers. Nocturnal BP recorded
with 24-h ABPM, but not daytime BP, was also lower by
10.38 ± 12.8 mmHg in the RDN group, though this was not
statistically significant. Safety endpoints including changes in
renal allograft function and renovascular complications were
not different between the 2 groups (231). Although native RDN
is effective in controlling BP, larger RCTs with a sham-control
are required.
CONCLUSIONS
HTN is a very common disease in CKD and ESRD and remains so
after kidney transplantation. The pathogenesis of post-transplant
HTN is complex. BP measurement is still the main barrier to
accurately diagnose and follow-up in HTN management. A 24-h
ABPM, though the gold standard, is inconvenient and not wildly
utilized. The choice of antihypertensive medication requires
the clinician to take transplant and immunological factors into
the consideration. Management for OSA and interventions
for resistant HTN, such as transplant renal artery angioplasty
± stenting, bilateral native nephrectomy, and native RDN,
remain options for resistant HTN in selected kidney transplant
recipients. There is no conclusive BP target for this population
and therapy targets need to be individualized. Further research
to develop a stronger body of evidence for the pathogenesis of
post-transplant HTN and guide clinicians on the appropriate
BP measurement method, use of antihypertensive medications,
surgical or procedural interventions, and establish BP targets for
kidney transplant recipients.
