Introduction
Budd–Chiari syndrome (BCS) is a rare disorder caused by
obstruction of the hepatic venous outflow tract at any level
between the small hepatic veins and the right atrium, hence
also known as hepatic venous outflow tract obstruction
(HVOTO) (Fig. 1a–c). This obstruction leads to venous
stasis resulting in congestive hepatopathy [1]. This congestive hepatopathy results in increased sinusoidal pressure
with hepatic sinusoidal thrombosis as evidenced by fibrin
deposition within sinusoids [2]. This sinusoidal thrombosis
in turn causes reduced hepatic perfusion leading to ischemia and necrosis of hepatocytes especially in perivenular
zones leading to fibrosis and portal hypertension [1, 2].
BCS may result due to primary venous problem or may
be secondary to compression/invasion of venous outflow
by a space occupying lesion within or outside the liver [3].
The onset of disease may be fulminant/acute, sub-acute or
chronic and accordingly the presenting complaints of the
patients [3]. The recognizable causes for BCS include
inherited or acquired hypercoagulable state. Other risk
factors for the development of BCS include pregnancy,
malnutrition, and the use of oral contraceptives. There is a
difference in presentation of BCS in developed nations and
the developing nations. Acute presentation is more common in the West, whereas sub-acute or chronic form is
more often seen in the East [1–4]. Further, while myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) account for 35–50% of
cases in European countries with JAK-2 mutations seen in
about 90% of patients, no major causal factors have been
identified in patients from China [4]. The frequency of
MPNs is also low in India, Middle East and Mediterranean
regions.
Clinical presentation and diagnosis
Clinical presentation may vary from no symptoms to
abdominal discomfort or ascites with splenomegaly and
signs of portal hypertension in chronic cases. Subacute
disease may present with ascites or variceal bleeding. In
acute disease, patients present with tender hepatomegaly,
ascites and jaundice [1, 3, 4].
The diagnosis of BCS is made by clinical presentation
and confirmatory investigations. Deranged liver function
tests are a cardinal feature; however, it may remain normal
in some patients. Serum aspartate and alanine aminotransferase levels may increase up to more than five times
the upper limit of the normal in fulminant and acute BCS
[3–5]. Findings suggesting a suspicion for BCS are presented in Table 1. Whenever one or more of these findings
are present, then BCS should be ruled out by further
investigations. Radiological imaging is the most important
tool to confirm the diagnosis and should be carried out even
when there is low clinical suspicion [3–5].
BCS may affect any age group but is commonly seen in
third to fifth decade [6]. The clinical presentation is different for pediatric and adult patients and same has been
reported. However, the disease is frequently seen involving
adolescents but the literature remains sparse. In this issue
of the Journal, Shukla et al. present data of 43 adolescents
with a different presentation for this age group [6]. They
found hepatomegaly leading to abdominal discomfort
without ascites as the most common presentation as compared to ascites being a common presentation in adults as
well as pediatric population in the previous reports. Also,
thrombophilic disorders unlike adults were uncommon in
these adolescents, as also seen in pediatric age. Outcomes
to the treatment were better in adolescents as compared to
children and similar to adults [6].
Shukla and colleagues highlight in this article that the
disease has a milder form of presentation in adolescents,

which could be due to better angiogenesis and collateral
formation, secondary to hormonal changes in this age
group and hence, the response to medical management is
better as compared to pediatric and adult patients [6]. This
hypothesis is based on a study demonstrating better collateral formation in young rabbits due to high VEGF levels
in young subjects. However, authors did not study the
expression of VEGF in the study population, hence, leaving
this hypothesis open for discussion and further study. This
finding suggests that severe form of disease seen in adults
may probably be the result of delayed diagnosis. This may
open up a debate whether patients diagnosed with BCS
with minimal or no symptoms should be offered treatment
to decongest the liver to prevent progression of disease or
the treatment to decongest the liver should be offered only
if patients become symptomatic for the disease while
patients being only on medical management.
Liver stiffness measurements (LSM) using Fibroscan
can be a promising tool to decide regarding the time of
intervention. In asymptomatic patients, serial LSM may be
used to assess the changes in liver congestion with medical
management and in case of rising LSM, the patient may be
offered endovascular treatments for liver decongestion [7].
LSM can also be used as a non-invasive tool to assess
hepatic congestion before and after venous outflow
restoration [8]. It is an indirect method to assess the outcome and therapeutic benefits of interventions aimed at
decongesting the liver [8].
The management of patients with BCS remains complex
mostly due to a plethora of clinical presentations, resulting
from venous flow, potential of collateral development,
vascular compliance, endothelial integrity and pro-coagulant status of an individual. These local factors in addition
to causing venous occlusion, also lead to development of
hepatic parenchymal injury by ischemia and compression.
These could result in hepatic fibrosis which if progressive
could mimic cirrhosis of the liver. Liver biopsy, though
challenging, is an important guide to detect the level of
fibrosis/necrosis and to plan treatment in BCS. For fulminant disease, the jury is clear and mandates liver transplantation; whereas there is no specified guideline available
for the management of BCS with or without cirrhosis.
There is, therefore, a need for a comprehensive algorithm taking into consideration both the venous occlusion
and the stage of liver disease while deciding treatment for
BCS. The BCS may be subcategorized into three subgroups

suprahepatic IVC leading to formation of small intrahepatic venovenous collaterals trying to drain into right atrium with reversal of
flow in IVC and portal vein (treatment in this case would be IVC
recanalization), b shows patent IVC with occlusion hepatic veins at
the osteum and treatment in this case would be recanalization of the
best hepatic vein. c shows patent IVC and complete occlusion of all
three native hepatic vein with very small intrahepatic veno-venous
collaterals. The treatment in this case would be creation of
portosystemic shunt (TIPS/DIPS). d shows the treatment option
available in all three varieties of outflow occlusion consisting of IVC/
Hepatic vein recanalization or creation of TIPS/DIPS

(BCS-A–C) depending upon severity of hepatic fibrosis
and accordingly treatment may be offered and follow-up
may be designed. A simplified algorithm is proposed
(Fig. 2).
Management options for BCS include medical,
endovascular interventions and surgical, including liver
transplantation.
Medical management focuses on control of portal
hypertension and ascites with systemic anticoagulation.
Medical management is effective in cases with good
venous collateralization and is effective in about a quarter
of the patients [4, 6]. Anticoagulation remains the most
important aspect in the management in all situations
(a) whether a prothrombotic disorder is identified or not,
(b) whether a patient is only on medical management or
requires an endovascular/surgical interventions. As, most
patients will require endovascular or surgical intervention,
a long-term anticoagulation for maintaining the patency of
the collateral or recanalized vein, transjugular intrahepatic
porto-systemic shunt (TIPS)/surgical shunt is mandatory
[4, 5].
The goal of endovascular treatment is to relieve hepatic
congestion resulting in restoration of hepatocyte perfusion
and relieving portal hypertension as well as its symptoms
thereby halting further deterioration of hepatic function
(Fig. 1) [9]. Whenever possible, early recanalization of the
obstructed hepatic venous outflow should be the first line of
treatment in BCS, because these patients with recanalizable
hepatic vein/inferior vena cava (IVC) generally have mild
fibrosis with good post intervention outcome [7]. For the
patients reported by Shukla et al., whether such an
approach should be undertaken remains a debatable question, due to the adolescent age.
Surgical management is considered if endovascular
treatments are not feasible and includes membrane resection with/without IVC reconstruction, portosystemic/mesoatrial/portoatrial shunts, and liver transplant [4, 5]. Liver
transplant remains the preferred treatment for patients with
fulminant BCS [4, 5, 7]. Most authors agree that not all
patients with BCS should undergo liver transplant and that
this therapeutic option should probably be used exclusively
in patients with fulminant BCS or in patients with chronic
cirrhosis [5, 9].
Outcome and prognosis
Several scores have been available and evaluated in BCS,
such as, the Child–Pugh, MELD, Clichy PI, Rotterdam
score, New Clichy PI and BCS-TIPS and may be used to
predict the outcomes and prognosis of the disease [6]. The
prognosis is better if disease is identified early and treatment is started [7]. Whether these approaches are feasible
and provide long-term benefit in the pediatric and adolescent patients remains to be seen. The young BCS provides
a unique opportunity to study the natural history and longterm outcome of interventions, to the hepatology and
radiology community; one more reason for collaborative
work!
