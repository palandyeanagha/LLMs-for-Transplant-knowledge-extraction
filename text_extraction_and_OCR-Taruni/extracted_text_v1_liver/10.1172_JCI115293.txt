Abstract
Endothelin (ET), a peptide synthesized by endothelial cells
(EC), causes a decreased renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate and an increased mean arterial pressure when infused
in animals. In tissue culture, ET causes smooth muscle cell
(SMC) proliferation and contraction by influx of extracellular
calcium, which is inhibited by calcium channel antagonists. Infusion of cyclosporine (CSA) hemodynamically parallels ET
action, and knowing that CSA effects EC, we hypothesize that
the vasoconstrictive effects of CSA are a result of ET synthesis
by EC.
Varying concentrations of CSA were incubated with EC resulting in ET present in the supernatants in a dose-dependent
manner peaking at 75% above basal activity. Coincubation of
either cremophor alone or cycloheximide with CSA resulted in
minimal ET present in the EC supernatants (P < 0.01 each).
Incubation of conditioned media from CSA-treated EC with
SMC caused proliferation at 114% above basal activity, which
did not occur in the presence of CSA alone (P < 0.01). This
activity is specifically inhibited in the presence of an anti-ET
antibody or nonspecifically in the presence of calcium channel
antagonists (P < 0.01 each).
Therefore, CSA stimulates EC synthesis of ET which in
turn causes SMC proliferation. This action is inhibited by the
coincubation of a specific antibody to ET or a calcium channel
antagonist. These findings may help in the understanding of
CSA-induced hypertension and vasculopathy. (J. Clin. Invest.

merular mesangial cells (GMG) which contain specific ET binding sites, resulting in cellular contraction and proliferation (4-
13). Infusion of ET in animals results in vasoconstriction with
a decrease in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal
blood flow (RBF), as well as an increase in the mean arterial
blood pressure (MAP) (14-16). Separate investigators have
demonstrated inhibition of the vascular constrictive effects of
ET by the administration ofcalcium channel blockers (17, 18),
suggesting that the constrictive effects ofET are in part calcium
channel dependent, the specificity of which is under investigation.
CSA, an immunosuppressive agent used widely in organ
transplantation, has similar hemodynamic properties of ET
(19). Upon infusion of CSA into animals, a decrease in the
GFR and RBF occurs along with an increase in the MAP,
contributing to diminished renal function (20). Calcium channel blockers have been used to decrease the degree of acute
tubular necrosis and diminished renal function induced by
CSA in transplanted allografts (21, 22).
Due to the parallel hemodynamic effects of CSA and ET
upon SMC, we hypothesized that CSA may induce endothelin
synthesis by endothelial cells which in turns acts upon vascular
SMC. Also, knowing that the hemodynamic effects ofboth ET
and CSA are somewhat blunted by the use of calcium channel
blockers, we further hypothesized that if CSA stimulates the
synthesis of ET, then the concomitant administration of calcium channel blockers may inhibit the SMC effects in the CSA
recipient.
Methods
Tissue culture. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HVEC) were
grown using standard techniques (23). The tissue culture media contained M199 (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO), 0.015 M Hepes
(Sigma Chemical Co.), Amphotericin (0.025 mg/ml)/Penicillin (100
U/ml)/Streptomycin (100 mg/ml) (Sigma Chemical Co.), and 10% NuSerum (Collaborative Research, Bedford, MA) pH 7.3-7.4. HVECs
were grown in 95% air and 5% CO2 at 370C. Primary cultures were
grown to confluency on 0.2% gelatin-coated (Sigma Chemical Co.) culture flasks and all experiments were carried out on first passage HVEC
in 24- or 96-well plates (Fisher, St. Louis, MO). The HVECs were
passaged using a 0.5 mg/ml trypsin and 0.25 mmol EDTA solution
(Sigma Chemical Co.). The endothelial cells were identified by their
typical monolayer cobblestone appearance, positive immunofluorescence for anti-Factor VIII antibody (Bio Products for Science, Indianapolis, IN), and by their positive uptake ofdiacetytlated LDL (Biomedical Technologies, Stoughton, MA) (23, 23).
hSMC (CRL-1692) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). These cells were grown in media identical to that used with the HVEC in T-75 flasks (Fisher) until the proliferation experiments.
Pharmacologic agents used in these experiments included CSA in
cremophor or cremophor alone (Sandoz Corp., Basel, Switzerland),
Verapamil (Quad Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Indianapolis, IN), a sterile
preparation of Nifedipine (Pfizer Laboratories, New York) cycloheximide (ICN Biomedical, Irving, CA), and PDGF (Sigma Chemical Co.).

Both the RIA kit used to measure ET and the anti-ET antibody
were purchased from Peninsula Laboratories, Belmont, CA. The crossreactivity of measured human ET using this kit is 100% of ET- 1, and
7% with ET-2 and -3 each, while the anti-ET antibody preparation is
100% cross-reactive with human ET-1, -2, and -3.
First passage HVECs were plated in duplicate wells at a density of
25,000 cells per well in 24-well plates and allowed to grow to confluency (7-8 d) as determined by observation using a Nikon inverted
microscope. At the time of confluency, the media was changed to 200
ul of media containing CSA in cremophor or equal concentrations of
cremophor alone at concentrations of 0, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, and
500 ug/liter. These concentrations were chosen due to the range of
therapeutic levels of CSA used clinically. After 24 h of incubation, the
supernatants were removed and assayed for the presence of ET. This
experiment was repeated on two separate occasions and the data is a
summary of all three assays.
Next, we repeated the initial experiments incubating confluent
HVECs with 200 ul of media containing CSA at the previously described dosages, along with cycloheximide (10 Mg/ml) for inhibition of
protein synthesis. After 24 h ofincubation, each supernatant was separately assayed for the presence of ET. As in the first set ofexperiments,
these experiments were repeated on two separate occasions and the
data is a summary of all three assays.
The initial experiment was again repeated and the media from
CSA-treated HVEC (conditioned media) after 24 h of incubation was
removed. 100 ul of conditioned media was combined with 100 g1
(40,000) ofHSMC and 50 ild of[3H]thymidine (20 .Ci/ml) for proliferation studies as described by others (15). This experiment was then repeated in three separate experiments in the presence of (a) anti-ET
antibody (1 Il/well), (b) Verapamil (100 sg/ml), or (c) Nifedipine (10
MM). Lastly, in order to exclude proliferative effects of CSA directly
upon HSMC, CSA, in media at concentrations previously described,
was incubated directly with HSMC and analyzed for proliferation. As
in the first set of experiments, these experiments were repeated on two
separate occasions and the data is a summary of all three assays.
We next evaluated calcium channel antagonists independent of
CSA to insure that these agents did not have unto themselves direct
effects upon hSMC. hSMC proliferation was evaluated as previously
described in the presence of the following: (a) non-CSA (i.e., 0 Mg/liter
CSA concentration) containing stock media not incubated with
HVEC, (b) non-CSA containing media incubated with HVEC for 24 h,
(c) non-CSA containing media incubated with HVEC for 24 h containing Verapamil, or (d) Nifedipine. The concentration of calcium channel antagonists were as previously described. Each experiment was run
on two separate occasions and the data is a summary ofall three assays.
Finally, we looked at hSMC proliferation by an unrelated peptide to
determine the specificity ofthe anti-ET antibody. In these experiments,
parallel wells of [3H]thymidine-labeled hSMC were incubated in the
presence and absence of 5 ng/ml of PDGF and analyzed for proliferation. These experiments were repeated in the presence of the anti-ET
antibody at concentrations of 1 ul/well. Each experiment was run on
two separate occasions and the data is a summary of all three assays.
All incubations were carried out in duplicate and statistical significance was determined using the Student's t test at P < 0.01. Where
applicable, the data is presented as the mean±SEM.
Results
Fig. 1 demonstrates a CSA dose-dependent increase of ET in
the HVEC supernatants as compared with their basal synthesis
(P < 0.01). The maximum synthesis of ET is 75% above basal
levels resulting in a peak concentration of75±3.2 mmol, which
is in the range of ET synthesis reported by Chabrier et al. from
unstimulated HVEC (17). Cremophor alone incubated with
confluent HVEC failed to result in ET synthesis (P < 0.01).

minished amounts of ET within the supernatants with a peak
concentration of ET of 5% above basal at 500 ,gg/liter of CSA
(Fig. 1). This is compared with the concentration ofET of 75%
above basal at 500 /Ag/liter of CSA alone (P < 0.01).
Conditioned media from the HVECs incubated with the
CSA resulted in hSMC proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the direct incubation of CSA with hSMC resulted
in no proliferation above basal levels (P < 0.01, Fig. 2). The
conditioned media of the high dose CSA resulted in proliferation 1 14% above basal levels (P< 0.01). The degree ofproliferation was diminished at all CSA concentrations of the conditioned media with the coincubation of a specific ET antibody
(P < 0.01, Fig. 2).
Separate coincubation of Verapamil and Nifedipine with
hSMC and condition media resulted in inhibition ofproliferation similar to that seen with the coadministration of the antiET antibody (P < 0.01, Fig. 3).
Comparison of hSMC proliferation by non-CSA containing media incubated with HVEC in the presence or absence of
calcium channel antagonists failed to result in any statistical
difference in hSMC proliferation (Fig. 4). Yet, comparison of
HVEC-incubated media versus stock media did result in a significant increase in hSMC (P < 0.01, Fig. 4).
Incubation of PDGF resulted in significant proliferation of
hSMC as compared with baseline (P < 0.01), which was unaffected by the presence of anti-ET antibody (Table I).
Discussion
CSA-induced hemodynamic effects of diminished GFR and
RBF as well as increased MAP have been shown to be due to
progressive luminal narrowing ofthe afferent arteriole secondary to progressive SMC proliferation (25). Perico et al. recently
have shown that the use of CSA results in the progressive increased peripheral vascular resistance leading to preglomerular
vasoconstriction and eventual loss of glomerular blood flow
(26). These studies provide a histologic basis of understanding
ofthe changes in GFR with both the acute as well as the chronic
administration ofCSA. The use ofCSA in recent renal allograft
transplants results in a reversible form of renal insufficiency

while the chronic use of CSA may lead to progressive and
nonreversible renal failure (27, 28).
This vasoconstrictive effect of CSA does not totally explain
the end result of irreversible loss of glomerular flow and localized thrombosis that may occur with chronic CSA administration (29, 30). The known effect of CSA upon endothelial cells
as demonstrated in tissue culture experiments may contribute
to the understanding of these irreversible changes. In vivo experiments have demonstrated that the direct incubation of
CSA with vascular endothelial cells increased cell membrane
disruption, as demonstrated by chromium 51 release, diminished Pgl2 synthesis, diminished extracellular matrix production, and caused detachment of vascular endothelial cells (31-
36). Further, diminished Factor VIII, as demonstrated by in
vivo techniques, occurs in the face of CSA exposure (36). This
may be due to increased release of Factor VIII by endothelial
cells, for Factor VIII levels have been shown to be increased in
renal transplant patients receiving CSA (37).
Thus, this combination ofvasoconstriction as well as direct
effect of CSA upon vascular endothelial cells may additively
result in the Shwartzman-like effect upon glomeruli (29, 30).

The peptide endothelin has been found to be synthesized by
endothelial cells derived from animals and humans (1-3). In
tissue culture experiments, ET binds to specific binding sites on
smooth muscle cells as well as glomerular mesangial cells resulting in proliferation and contraction (4, 11, 12).
Due to its known vasoconstrictive effects, ET, as a causative
agent in acute renal failure, has been suggested based on known
hemodynamic animal data (38). Following this hypothesis in
the area of transplantation, it has been speculated that ET is a
contributor to the mechanism of CSA nephrotoxicity (39)
The etiology ofthe vasoconstrictive effects ofCSA has been
shown in animal experiments to be due to the presence of ET
and its subsequent effect upon vascular SMC (26, 40). In these
studies, the vasoconstriction of CSA is reversed or prevented
with either the coadministration or pretreatment with an antibody specific to ET. The applicability to human tissue is yet to
be determined, for it is recognized that endothelial cells from
animals and humans respond differently to identical stimuli
(41, 42). Our findings of basal ET synthesis by HVEC that is
increased with CSA provocation is supported by work of separate investigators. Clozel and Fischli have shown that ET is
present in the supernatants of unstimulated HVEC (3), while
Grieff et al. reported that plasma ET levels are increased in
renal transplant recipients relative to the administration of
CSA (43). Grieffet al. suggest that the mechanism of the vasoconstrictive effects of CSA is stimulation of vascular endothelial cells to synthesize ET, which in turn acts upon the perivasTable I. Smooth Muscle Cell Proliferation

cular smooth muscle cells, resulting in a diminished GFR and
RBF. Finally, investigators have shown that CSA increases the
ET binding sites in cardiac smooth muscle cells (44) and may
possibly increase binding sites in other cells as well. Therefore,
from these in vivo as well as in vitro studies, it is demonstrated
that HVEC can synthesize ET, which is present in rodents as
well as humans who receive CSA. Further, these animal studies
reveal diminished RBF secondary to CSA, which is reversed
with the coadministration of a specific antibody to ET (26, 40).
The use of CSA in recent renal allograft transplants results
in a reversible form of renal insufficiency that is improved with
the use of a calcium channel antagonist (21, 22). The prevention of posttransplantation ischemia by coadministration of a
calcium channel antagonist may be partially explained by what
is known of ET's effect upon vascular smooth muscle cells. The
mechanism of action of ET to induce constriction of SMC
involves influx of extracellular calcium (45). Conflicting studies indicate that the constrictive effects of ET upon SMC may
be inhibited by calcium channel antagonists such as Verapamil
or Nitrendipine, while other calcium channel antagonists such
as Nifedipine or Diltiazem may have little effect (7, 17). This is
further borne out in studies with Nicardipine. This dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channel antagonist has been shown by
some investigators to affect extracellular calcium influx into
rodent SMC in response to ET stimulation, while other investigators are in disagreement (4, 18). This conflict may be due to
methodologic or species variations.
Nitrendipine, used in clinical trials, as well as the other
calcium channel antagonists available for clinical use (Verapamil, Nifedipine and Diltiazem) have each been shown to be
effective for the use ofhypertension as well as renal perfusion in
the transplanted renal allograft (46, 47). Therefore, while calcium channel antagonists may have various responses to ET's
effect upon SMC, clinically available calcium channel antagonists each appear to be useful for the treatment ofhypertension
and diminished RBF that is clinically evident in recipients of
CSA (21, 22, 47). This conflict between the clinical and in vivo
effects of calcium channel antagonists may be due to hemodynamic effects of CSA other than that induced by ET. Other
explanations include species as well as methodologic variations
that require further investigation.
This study demonstrates that ET is present in the supernatants ofCSA-stimulated HVEC in a CSA dose-dependent manner. The presence of ET appears to be an effect of synthesis as
opposed to cytotoxicity, for ET is not found in the supernatants
ofCSA-stimulated HVEC in the presence ofa protein synthesis
inhibitor.
Knowing that ET stimulates SMC proliferation and contraction, we have demonstrated that ET present in the supernatants of CSA-stimulated HVEC induces hSMC proliferation.
This effect is not a function of CSA upon hSMC, for these
experiments show that no proliferation occurs when CSA is
directly incubated with hSMC. Further, this study demonstrates that in the presence of a specific anti-ET antibody no
proliferation occurs, supporting the hypothesis that the proliferative effect of the CSA-stimulated HVEC is from ET. To ensure that anti-ET antibody does not have specific proliferative
inhibitory effects upon hSMC regardless ofthe cause ofproliferation, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) was incubated
with hSMC to induce proliferation. Comparing PDGF-induced proliferation in the presence or absence ofanti-ET antibody, no significant difference in proliferation occurred. Therefore, the inhibition ofconditioned media-induced hSMCproliferation by an anti-ET antibody appears to be specific to ET
present in the conditioned media, thus supporting our hypothesis.
Calcium channel antagonists have been shown to inhibit
ET-induced SMCproliferation and contraction (8). These studies support our interpretation that ET is present from CSAstimulated HVECwhich subsequently induces hSMCproliferation. In the presence of calcium channel antagonists, hSMC
proliferation from conditioned media is inhibited. We agree
with Wallnofer et al. that this inhibition is not ET specific, yet
more likely speaks to the mechanism of action of ET upon
SMC (8). The suggestion that ET is an endogenous calcium
channel agonist that can be specifically inhibited by calcium
antagonists is tempting yet has been found not be valid. The
calcium channel antagonist effect is parallel to that of other
SMC mitogens (e.g., norepinephrine or PGF2 alpha) whose actions upon SMC also can be inhibited by calcium channel antagonists.
The findings presented here support the role of ET as a
mediator of vasoconstriction with resulting hemodynamic effects due to CSA administration. The role of calcium antagonists as an approach to diminishing immediate posttransplantation renal allograft dysfunction is supported by our study, yet
the mechanism ofenhancing RBF by calcium channel antagonists may be due to a multitude of causes including ET-induced SMC constriction. Further studies are needed in order to
identify other mediators of changes in renal hemodynamics.
This study, in consort with others, may contribute to the further understanding of CSA-induced vasculopathy and hypertension, which may in turn result in specific ET as well as other
antagonists for the prevention or reversibility ofthese problematic complications of CSA.
