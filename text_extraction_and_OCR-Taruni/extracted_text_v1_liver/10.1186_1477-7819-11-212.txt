Abstract
Background: To investigate the prediction value of preoperative serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level for the
prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), by comparing pathological characteristics, recurrence rate and survival
rate after hepatectomy.
Methods: 108 cases of HCC patients who received liver resection in our hospital from 2005 to 2011 were enrolled
in this study. According to preoperative serum AFP level, the patients were divided into AFP ≤ 20 ng/mL group,
AFP 20 to 400 ng/mL group and AFP > 400 ng/mL group, and the clinicopathological and cytopathological
features were compared. All the patients were followed up for 24 months, the postoperative recurrence rates and
survival rates were compared and analyzed, and the risk factors for HCC postoperative survival rate were studied by
multifactor regression analysis.
Results: Of the 108 cases of HCC patients, there were 42 cases in AFP ≤20 ng/mL group, 28 cases in AFP
20–400 ng/mL group and 39 cases in AFP > 400 ng/mL group. It was shown that cell differentiation degrees
(χ
2 = 20.198, P = 0.000) and microvascular invasion rates (χ2 = 20.358, P = 0.000) were significantly different among
the three groups. The AFP ≤ 20 ng/mL group showed higher cell differentiation degrees and significantly lower
microvascular invasion rates compared to the other groups (P < 0.05). The follow-up data showed that postoperative
2-year recurrence rate (χ
2 = 6.164, P = 0.046), 18-month survival rate (χ2 = 7.647, P = 0.022) and 24-month survival rate
(χ
2 = 6.725, P = 0.035) of the three groups were significantly different, and we found that the AFP ≤ 20 ng/mL
group had lower postoperative 2-year recurrence rate, and higher 18-month survival rate and 24-month survival
rate than the other two groups (P <0.05). Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that tumor diameter
(≥ 5 cm) and preoperative serum AFP level (> 400 ng/mL) were closely correlated with HCC postoperative
survival rate (P <0.05).
Conclusions: It is shown that preoperative serum AFP level has considerable predictive value for the malignant
feature and prognosis of HCC. It is suggested that HCC patients with no contraindication of operation and serum
AFP ≤ 20 ng/mL can benefit most from primary treatment of hepatectomy. While HCC patients with serum AFP
higher than 20 ng/mL need comprehensive therapy besides surgical resection and close follow up.

Background
Primary liver cancer is one of the common malignant
tumors in China and is the second leading malignant
tumor with high mortality rates [1]. There are three main
types, namely, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), bile duct
carcinoma and mixed-type HCC, and more than 90% are
HCC. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a glycoprotein, mainly
from the yolk sac and embryo liver; serum AFP levels are
very low in adults. Since the 1970s, AFP has been used as
a tumor marker for the diagnosis of HCC. Serum AFP
levels in nearly 75% of cases of HCC are higher than
10 ug/L [2]. Serum AFP lever is still regarded as the
most important serum marker for HCC diagnosis today,
though it can be high in some non-cancerous liver disease
and can be at a low level in some HCC patients [3,4]. In
patients with cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis C
infections, AFP is the most important serum marker to
predict liver cancer occurrence [5,6]. The serum AFP level
not only has diagnostic value but also has predictive value
for the prognosis of HCC. As a relatively cheap and
mature method, serum AFP has been regarded as an
important indicator of postoperative HCC recurrence
and metastasis [7]. In addition, a high serum AFP level
has been associated with larger tumor size, bilobar
involvement, massive or diffuse-type tumors, and portal
vein tumor thrombus [8]. Nevertheless, no consistent
correlation has been established between serum AFP
level and tumor stage, degree of tumor differentiation,
or extrahepatic metastasis [9]. In this study, we analyzed
the correlation of preoperative serum AFP levels with
HCC malignant features and survival after hepatectomy,
through 24 months of follow up of 108 patients with
HCC, who underwent hepatectomy at a single center.
Methods
Ethical approval
This study was approved by the institutional review
board (IRB) of the first affiliated hospital of Zhejiang
University.
Patient selection
Patients who underwent hepatectomy for primary liver
cancer (n = 108) were enrolled in this study. Written
informed consent for each patient was given before
participating in the study. All patients were diagnosed as
primary HCC on both imaging and histopathological
study. All the histopathological diagnoses were confirmed
to be HCC with distinctive microscopic features and
immunohistochemistry staining results. Patients with
serious heart, lung, kidney, or blood diseases, autoimmune
liver disease, or the presence of other malignant tumors,
were excluded. All the patients underwent surgical
resection as their initial treatment. Radical resection
was performed in patients with a regional tumor, and
patients with a portal vein tumor thrombus received
tumor resection plus portal vein thrombectomy or
postoperative portal vein perfusion chemotherapy.
Preoperative and postoperative tumor assessment
Preoperative tumor staging was performed by dynamic
computed tomography (CT), assessing tumor size, tumor
number, portal vein involvement and regional tumor
invasion. Postoperative tumor assessment was made by
pathological study of the degree of tumor differentiation,
vascular involvement, nerve involvement, lymphatic involvement and non-cancerous liver tissue fibrosis. Adjacent non-cancerous liver tissue was examined by reticular
fiber staining, according to the Ishak scoring system
(1995) for scoring the degree of fibrosis. Histopathological
immunohistochemistry staining of hepatocytes and CK7
were studied by using the EnVision (Zhongshan biotechnology, Beijing) two-step method.
Measurement of serum AFP
Serum AFP concentrations were determined within 1
month before surgery using a commercially available
chemiluminescence immunoassay kit. According to preoperative serum AFP levels, the patients were divided into
three groups: (1) AFP negative, AFP ≤ 20 ng/mL (n = 41);
(2) AFP low, AFP 20 ng/mL to 400 ng/mL (n = 28); (3)
AFP high, AFP > 400 ng/mL (n = 39).
Follow up
All the enrolled patients were followed up for 2 years.
The postoperative recurrence rate was assessed at 1 and
2 years, and survival was assessed at 6, 12, 18, and 24
months.
Statistical analysis
All the data were statistically analyzed using the SPSS 15.0
software. Quantitative data were presented as mean ± SD
(x ± s). The ages and diameters of tumors in the three
groups of patients were compared by analysis of variance;
the rate and constituent ratio were compared by the
chi-square test; comparisons between two of the three
groups with performed by the Student-Newman-Keuls
method. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to ascertain the independent risk factors for HCC
postoperative prognosis. For study time points (tK) of 6,
12, 18, and 24 months after surgery:
Survival rate = Number of survival cases at tK time

disease did not differ between the three groups (P > 0.05),
as shown in the Table 1.
Preoperative clinicopathologic variables
The clinicopathologic variables in the three groups of
patients, including tumor volume, total tumor diameter,
portal vein tumor thrombus, adjacent tissue invasion, and
lymph node involvement, were analyzed by statistical
software. None of the variables above were statistically
different (P > 0.05), as shown in the Table 1.
Pathological features
The difference in the degree of tumor differentiation and
vascular involvement were evaluated by the chi-square
test. Both HCC tissue differentiation (χ2
= 20.198, P =
0.000) and vascular involvement were statistically different (χ2 = 20.358, P = 0.000) among the three groups
of patients. Through paired comparison, the differences
between the AFP-negative and AFP-low group, and
between the AFP-negative and the AFP-high group
were both statistically significant (P < 0.05), whereas
the difference between the AFP-low and AFP-high
groups was not (P > 0.05), as shown in Table 2. Differences in nerve involvement, lymphatic involvement,
and para-cancerous liver fibrosis, were not statistically
significant (P > 0.05), as shown in Table 1.
Follow up
All patients received consecutive follow up for 2 years.
One-year recurrence rates between the three groups
of patients showed no statistical difference (χ2 = 0.448,
P = 0.799), however, 2-year recurrence rates between
the three groups, showed statistically differences (χ2 =
6.164, P = 0.046), as shown in Table 1. Two-year
recurrence rates were compared in the three groups;
between the AFP-negative and AFP-low groups, and
the AFP-high and AFP-low groups, the differences were
not statistically significant (P > 0.05); between the AFPnegative and the AFP-high group the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05), as shown in Table 2. In all the
108 patients who underwent hepatectomy, 33 patients had
recurrence within 2 years. Among them, six patients had a
second surgical excision, seven had microwave ablation
therapy, eighteen had trans-hepatic arterial chemotherapy
and embolization, and two patients had no further
treatment.
The Kaplan-Meier method was employed to analyze
the correlation between preoperative serum AFP levels
and the prognosis of HCC. The survival rates in the
three groups of patients at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months are
shown in Table 1, and the survival curves in Figure 1.
Our results show that higher preoperative AFP levels
correlate with poorer prognosis. Among them, the survival
rates at 18 months (χ2 = 7.647, P = 0.022) and 24 months

(χ2 = 6.725, P = 0.035) were statistically different
between the three groups. On paired comparisons, the
differences were not statistically significant (P > 0.05) in
the AFP-negative compared to the AFP-low group, or
in the AFP-low compared to the AFP-high group,
whereas the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05)
in the AFP-negative compared to the AFP-high group,
as shown in the Table 2.
Multivariate analysis
We performed univariate analysis of risk factors for
HCC postoperative recurrence and survival, including
age, gender, HBsAg-positive status, family history of liver
cancer, degree of fibrosis, tumor volume, tumor diameter,
and AFP level. Only tumor diameter and AFP level were
statistically significant (P < 0.05), as shown in Table 3.
Moreover, on multiple logistic regression analysis, tumor
diameter and preoperative serum AFP levels were closely
correlated with HCC postoperative survival rates (P < 0.05),
as shown in Table 4.
Discussion
Primary liver cancer is a common malignant tumor. In
many countries, including China, the incidence, recurrence
and mortality rates of liver cancer remain high. Clinical
studies have shown that there is a close relationship
between the level of serum AFP and HCC incidence,
recurrence and metastasis, and serum AFP level has
been used as the main index of prediction for HCC
prognosis after hepatectomy [5,10,11].
From pathological studies, there is literature showing
that in normal liver tissue and serum AFP-negative
HCC, AFP and AFP receptors are not expressed; AFP
receptors are expressed only in the AFP-positive HCC
tissues [12]. Other scholars conducted a comparative
study of the ultrastructural and immunohistochemical

features of the AFP-negative and -positive HCC tissues
[13], and found the TN (Thomsen-Friedenreich-related
antigen) protein expression level and positive rate in
an AFP-negative group was significantly higher than in
an AFP-positive group. The expression of AFP in the
AFP-negative group was significantly lower than in the
AFP-positive group. Under the electron microscope, AFPnegative HCC cells show simple organelles and rich
free ribosomes; in AFP-positive ones, rich organelles,
particularly the rough endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria and Golgi complex can be clearly observed in
the cytoplasm. Whether these features are associated
with AFP expression in HCC needs further study.
Through the retrospective study on the 108 patients
with HCC, we found that the degree of differentiation in
the AFP-negative group was higher than that in the
AFP-low and the AFP-high groups, and the vascular
infiltration rate in the AFP-negative group was lower
than that in the other two groups, though the differences
were not statistically significant between the AFP-low
group and AFP-high group. Tumor size, number of portal
vein tumor thrombi, adjacent organ invasion and lymph
node involvement were not significantly different among
the three groups. However, the above pathological characteristics were less severe in terms of malignant features
in the AFP-negative than in the AFP-positive group,
which might explain its better prognosis. On follow up,
there were no significant differences in recurrence or
survival rates between the three groups during the first
12 months. On 24-month follow up, patients in the
AFP-negative group had a lower recurrence rate and
higher survival rate when compared with the AFP-high
group; however, the differences between the AFP-low
and the AFP-high group were not significant. We also
observed remarkable pathologically different features in
the AFP-negative compared to the AFP-low group;
however, the recurrence rate and survival rate were not
significantly different. Our results showed that patients
who had higher preoperative AFP levels were more
likely to experience recurrence on short-term follow
up. We need longer a follow-up period to confirm the
long-term prognosis.
Conclusions
In summary, based on the results of the current study,
we revealed that the extent of malignancy and long-term
recurrence rate of AFP-negative HCC is lower, survival
rate is higher, and prognosis is better. Therefore, preoperative serum AFP level has considerable predictive value
for the malignant features and prognosis for patients
with HCC. Meanwhile, multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that preoperative serum AFP level (> 400
ng/mL) was an independent prognostic factor for HCC
postoperative survival rates. Results from other studies
also showed the AFP level was an important prediction
factor for the recurrence and prognosis of HCC after
resection, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) or
radiofrequency ablation (RFA) treatment [6,14-16], and
it could be used to evaluate the prognosis of HCC as
an independent influential factor [17,18].
For years, radical hepatectomy has been considered
the standard treatment for resectable primary carcinoma
[19]. From the results of this study, hepatectomy was
shown to be less effective in HCC patients with higher
preoperative AFP levels (> 400 ng/mL) compared to the
AFP-negative patients, and similar results were reported
in other studies [12]. Therefore, comprehensive therapy,
needs to be considered as well as surgery, in patients with
HCC and higher AFP levels (> 400 ng/ml); a combination
with postoperative TACE or portal vein chemotherapy
may lead to a better prognosis [12]. On the other hand,
for the HCC patients with AFP levels between 20 and
400 ng/mL, the extent of malignancy is higher than
that in AFP-negative patients, and long-term prognosis
after resection need to be further studied; our group
will continue to follow up these patients. Close follow

up is needed of patients with preoperative AFP levels
higher than 20 ng/mL.
In addition, in this study we found the degree of differentiation of AFP-negative HCC is relatively higher, and
microscopic vascular involvement is less common. In
the AFP-negative HCC the rate of tumor growth would
probably be expected to be relatively slow and tumor
staging might be lower than in AFP-positive HCC.
However, at the time of clinical diagnosis of liver cancer,
the staging of AFP-negative HCC was tantamount to that
in AFP-positive HCC patients, which may be related to
the lack of extensive use of a highly sensitive screening
index. The use of a sensitive serum biomarker to detect
the early recurrence and metastasis of AFP-negative HCC
is rare before signs are apparent on imaging studies. It was
reported that to some extent, high-sensitivity AFP-L3,
AFP-IgM complex, calcium, GP73, DCP bursin, VEGA,
GPC-3, and other markers can improve the sensitivity for
detection of tumor recurrence in AFP-negative HCC
[20-23], and have predictive value for the HCC therapeutic
effect [24]. However, they have not been applied widespread because of the limitations in the technique and the
cost of detection. As a result, novel serum markers that
can predict recurrence in AFP-negative HCC need further
investigation.
