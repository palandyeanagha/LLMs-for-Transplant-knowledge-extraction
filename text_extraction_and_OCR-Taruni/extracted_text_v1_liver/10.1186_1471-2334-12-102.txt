Abstract
Background: Co-infection with hepatitis C (HCV) is very common in human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1)
infected patients. Although HIV co-infection clearly accelerates progression of HCV-related fibrosis and liver disease,
controversy remains as to the impact of HCV on HIV disease progression in co-infected patients. HIV can cause
immune dysfunction, in which the regulatory function of T helper (Th) cells is very essential. Moreover, cytokines
derived from Th cells play a prominent role in viral infection. Investigating the functional changes of Th1 and Th2
cells in cytokine level can improve the understanding of the effect of co-infected HCV on HIV infection.
Methods: In this study, we measured the baseline Th1/Th2 cytokine concentration in sera by using flow cytometry
in HIV/HCV co-infection, HIV mono-infection, HCV mono-infection, and healthy control group, as well as the
dynamic changes of these cytokine levels after receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).
Results: The ratio of Th1 and Th2 cytokine concentration in HIV/HCV co-infection was higher than HCV monoinfection and healthy control group, while lower than HIV mono-infection group. After HAART was initiated, the
Th1/Th2 ratio of HIV/HCV co-infection group decreased to the same level of healthy control, while HIV monoinfection group was still higher than the control group.
Conclusions: There was no significant evidence showing co-infected with HCV had negative effect on HIV related
diseases. However, co-infected with HCV can decrease Th1/Th2 ratio by affecting Th1 cytokine level, especially the
secretion of IFN-g. With the initiation of HAART, Th1 and Th2 cytokine levels were progressively reduced. HIV was
the main stimulating factor of T cells in HIV/HCV co-infection group.
Background
Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) co-infected
with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is very common because
they share the same route of infection. These HIV/HCV
co-infected persons account for approximately 25% of
all HIV-infected persons all over the world [1]. Injection
drug users (IDUs) are shown to be the highest risk factor of HIV/HCV co-infection [2-5]. According to a
study investigation performed in 2008, approximately
63.2% of HIV-infected patients were co-infected with
HCV in different areas of China [6], and the prevalence
was 96.6% in IDUs and 92.9% in former paid blood
donors (FBD) [7]. The previous studies indicated that
HIV/HCV co-infection was associated with accelerated
progression of liver disease and decreased survival rate
among HCV-infected individuals comparing with HCV
mono-infection [8-10]. Since the widespread and effective introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy
(HAART) has successfully inhibited HIV-related diseases, the chronic liver diseases related to HCV have
become one of the major causes of death in HIV/HCV
co-infected patients [11,12]. However, studies of the
impact of HCV on HIV-infection have opposite conclusions. Some indicated HCV infection has a significant
effect on the progression of HIV to AIDS defining illness and AIDS related mortality [13-16], while others
found that HCV co-infection has no significant effect on
HIV progression [17-22]. Neither of their mechanisms
has been defined.

Immunological impairment is the main characteristic
of HIV pathogenesis. With the progressive loss of CD4+
T cells in HIV infection, the dysfunction in the T cells
compartment is reflected by cytokine expression levels
[23-25]. In experimental models, it is widely accepted
that susceptibility of BALB/c mice to L. major infection
is associated with interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10 produced
by Th2 cells, whereas resistance is related to early and
persistent interferon (IFN)-g produced by Th1 cells [26].
Simultaneous production of IFN-g, tumor necrosis factor
(TNF)-a, and IL-10 by antigen-stimulated peripheral
blood mononucleaer cells (PBMCs) from patients with
active lesions [27] and IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, and IFN-g
mRNAs were demonstrated in biopsy samples taken
from active lesions [28-30]. IL-10 expression was also significantly higher in patients who responded poorly to
pentamidine treatment [28]. Many studies indicated that
HIV-induced immunodeficiency often ascribed to a bias
of Th1/Th2 balance towards Th2 cytokine responses
[31], and this unbalance may recovered slightly when
patients received antiretroviral therapy (ART). However,
patients with weak immune response before treatment
may retain deficiency of immune function, despite of successful inhibition of HIV viral load and increase CD4+
T cell counts, including patients with impaired lymphoproliferative responses, antibody responses to vaccination
and cutaneous delayed-type hypersensitivity responses
[32]. In addition, HCV-induced liver diseases also affect
Th1/Th2 orientation by increasing Th1-type cytokine
production [33]. After stimulation by viral peptides or
antigen, the Th1 and Th2 cytokine levels were reduced in
mono-HIV infected women and more extensively in
women with HCV/HIV co-infection when compared
with mono-HCV infection [34]. However, the expression
profile of Th1/Th2 cytokine in HIV/HCV co-infected
patients and their dynamic changes during HAART is
rarely known.
In this study, we investigated the cytokine levels putatively produced by Th1 and Th2 cells in HIV/HCV coinfected, mono-HIV and mono-HCV infected patients as
the antiviral treatment proceeding. Our prospection is to
illustrate the difference of Th1/Th2 unbalance between
HIV/HCV co- and mono-infection by correlating the production of cytokines, which would be a convincible evidence of effect of HCV on HIV infected patients.
Methods
Study participants
A cohort including four groups in this study was established: HIV/HCV co-infected (n = 20), HCV monoinfected (n = 10), HIV mono-infected (n = 20), and
healthy controls (n = 10). For all participants, HCV infection was diagnosed according to the criteria as positive
plasma HCV antibodies and detectable baseline HCV
RNA (> 50 copies/ml); HIV infection was diagnosed
according to the criteria as seropositive for HIV and
nadir CD4+ T cell counts with 350 cells/μl. Healthy control subjects were negative for both HCV and HIV antibodies. All study participants were recruited from the
Department of Infectious Diseases of Tangdu Hospital
(Xi’an, China) and the Guangzhou 8th Hospital (Guangzhou, China). Neither the anti-HIV-positive nor antiHCV-positive patients had received ART treatment. All
studies were conducted with the approval of the ethical
review board of each institution. The inform consent was
get from each individual in this study.
Antiretroviral therapy criteria
HIV/HCV co-infected patients started HAART treatment
immediately after recruitment if their CD4+ T cell counts
were < 200 cells/μl. When the CD4+ T cell count was
achieved at > 200 cells/μl and kept stable within 3 months,
anti-HCV ART (Peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin) was
initiated. If the CD4+ T cell counts were between 200 and
350 cells/μl, HAART was started first, anti-HCV ART was
initiated after 12 weeks. HIV and HCV mono-infected
patients started HAART and anti-HCV ART treatment
directly after recruitment.
Viral load and lymphocyte subsets test
Both HIV and HCV plasma viral loads were analyzed by
the immunofluorescence quantifying PCR assay (Roche
Corporation, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. T-lymphocyte subsets were enumerated in 50
μl freshly obtained EDTA-anticoagulant whole blood
using 20 μl directly labeled mAbs (TriTEST: CD4-FIITC/
CD8-PE/CD3-PerCP) (BD Bioscience, USA) according to
the “lyse-no-wash” procedure. All samples were acquired
with a four-color FACS Calibur and analyzed using MultiSET software (Becton Dickison, USA).
Th1 and Th2 cytokines test
Six cytokines putatively produced by Th1 and Th2 cells,
including IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, TNF-a and IFN-g, were
detected using CBA Th1/Th2 cytokine kit (BD™ Cytometric Bead Array, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instruction. BD CellQuest software is required for acquiring samples and formatting data. Standard curves and
sample cytokine concentration were calculated using the
BD CBA Software (BD Bioscience, USA). Th1 cytokine
levels were represented by the amount of concentrations
of IFN-g, IL-2 and TNF-a; Th2 cytokine levels were represented by the amount of concentrations of IL-4, IL-5 and
IL-10.
Statistical Analysis
Data were expressed as the Median (interquartile range).

parameters was performed by SPSS 13.0 using standard
nonparametric statistical methods (Wilcoxon signedrank test and Mann-Whitney U test). Statistical analysis
of cytokine concentration between groups was performed using GraphPad Prism version 5.00 for Windows
(GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) using the Bonferroni post-test. The differences of Th1/Th2 ratio between
groups were compared using the Bonferroni’s Multiple
Comparison Test. Spearman correlation analysis was
performed for correlation analysis. All tests were twotailed, and p values of < 0.05 indicated statistical
significance.
Results
Study population characteristics and antiretroviral
therapeutic situation
Four groups of patients were recruited into this study:
HIV/HCV co-infected, HIV mono-infected, HCV monoinfected, and healthy controls. The demographics and
laboratory parameters of the four groups are summarized
in Table 1. The mean age of HIV/HCV co-infections was
older than HIV mono-infections (p > 0.05), as well as significantly younger than HCV mono-infections (p < 0.05).
The main transmission route of HIV/HCV co-infected
patients was IDU (80%). The HIV mono-infections has
the lowest nadir CD4 T cell count (p < 0.05) and highest
HIV-1 RNA levels in plasma (p < 0.05) comparing with
the other three study groups. The HCV RNA levels in
plasma of HIV/HCV co-infection group were higher than
HCV mono-infection group without statistical difference
(p > 0.05).
All patients infected with HIV were treated with combined ART according to currently accepted guidelines
(2NRTI + PI or 2NRTI + NNRTI). Patients infected with
HCV were treated for 48 week with pegylated IFN alfa-2a
(180 μg/week) and ribavirin (900 to 1,200 mg/day,
depending on body weight). HIV and HCV RNA levels
were measured at six time points: before the start of therapy (baseline) and at 4, 12, 24, 36 and 48 weeks of antiretroviral therapy (Figure 1). HIV/HCV co-infected
patients were more sensitive to HAART comparing with
HIV mono-infected patients. However, after 48 weeks of
HAART all patients had reached lower HIV-1 RNA level
which could be considered as a great viral response to
antiretroviral therapy (Figure 1A). HCV antiretroviral
therapeutic situation indicated that HIV/HCV coinfected patients were slower to reach sustained virologic
response (SVR) than HCV mono-infected patients
(Figure 1B).
Th1 and Th2 cytokine concentration between four groups
at baseline
Six cytokines were detected using CBA Th1/Th2 cytokine kit, Th1/Th2 cytokine standard curves were shown
in Figure 2. Cytokine concentration of plasma in patients
was calculated according to the standard curves with
20 pg/ml ~ 5000 pg/ml quantifiable ranges. Results of six
cytokines’ concentration of plasma in four study groups
were shown in Figure 3. IFN-g concentration was significantly lower in HIV/HCV co-infection group comparing
with HIV mono-infection group (p < 0.001), while higher
comparing with both HCV mono-infection (p < 0.001)

compared with the other three groups, but it was only
shown a statistical raise when compared with healthy

group, IL-2 concentration was the highest without statistical difference (p > 0.05). Co-infection group and HIV

IL-5 concentration when compared with HCV monoinfection and healthy control group (p > 0.05), while the
same level between HIV mono-infection. TNF-a concentration was detectable in the people who were infected
with HIV. Co-infection group has lower IL-4 concentration compared with both HIV mono- and HCV monoinfection group, while higher than healthy control group.
Furthermore, we estimated the ratio of Th1 and Th2 by
calculating Th1/2 cytokines’ concentration, thus to evaluate the change of Th1/Th2 expression balance. The ratio
of Th1 and Th2 cytokine concentration was presented in
Figure 4, illustrating the HIV mono-infection group had
the highest ratio than the others (p < 0.001); the ratio of
HIV/HCV co-infection group was significantly lower than
HIV mono-infection group (p < 0.001) and higher than
HCV mono-infection (p < 0.05). Comparing with healthy
controls, infected with HIV could induce higher Th1 cytokine levels, however, infected with HCV could induce
higher Th2 cytokine level. Considering these two opposite
effects, we observed a coordinative result in the HIV/HCV
co-infection group, which was higher than HCV monoinfection and lower than HIV mono-infection group.
Dynamic changes of Th1 and Th2 cytokines during
HAART
After initiating HAART, we estimated Th1 and Th2 cytokine levels of the HIV mono-infection and the HIV/HCV
co-infection group at series time-points (baseline, 4 weeks,
12 weeks, 24 weeks and 48 weeks). Concentration of IFNg at 48 weeks after HAART in HIV/HCV co-infected
patients indicated a significant decrease comparing with
the other time points (p < 0.01) (Figure 5A), while the
other cytokine levels presented no statistical differences.
However, concentration of IFN-g in HIV mono-infection
group was more variable during HAART (Figure 5B). IFNg was secreted at the highest level at the baseline (p <
0.001), fell sharply at 4 weeks after HAART (p < 0.05),
rebounded at 24 weeks (p < 0.001), and fell down again at
48 weeks (p < 0.001). Concentrations of IL-2 shown peak

level at baseline, descended quickly at 4 weeks (p < 0.01),
and ascended slightly as time-varying (p > 0.05). IL-4 was
secreted at first (p < 0.05), descended progressively after
HAART in 12 weeks (p < 0.05), rebounded abruptly at 24
weeks (p > 0.05), and fell off at 48 weeks (p < 0.05). TNFa, IL-10 and IL-5 levels remained the same level of baseline as HAART was proceeding.
The change of Th1/Th2 ratio of mono- and co-infection
group was demonstrated in Figure 6, which indicated that
co-infection group has a complete different pattern during
HAART; Th1/Th2 ratio in co-infection group was stabilized at first then elevated at 12 weeks, and descended
after 12 weeks; while in HIV mono-infection group Th1/
Th2 ratio fell sharply in 4 weeks then kept stable after
with a slightly ascending trend. After 48 weeks treatment
of HAART, Th1/Th2 ratio of HIV/HCV co-infected
patients stayed in the same level of healthy control group.
However, HIV mono-infection group was still higher than
the control group.
Furthermore, we evaluated the changes of Th1 and Th2
cytokine levels of the entire HIV infected patients who
had received HAART. There was an obviously time-varying descending pathway (Figure 7). Th1 cytokine levels
seemed more sensitive to HAART than Th2.

Relationships between Th1/Th2 cytokines, CD4+
T lymphocyte count and virus load
We analyzed the correlations between the main factors
concerned, included CD4+ T lymphocyte count, HIV viral
load, concentration of Th1 and Th2 cytokines (IL-2, IL-4,
IL-5, IL-10, TNF-a and IFN-g) and Th1/Th2 ratio, the
results were exhibited on Table 2. Statistic results indicated that HIV-1 viral load had strong positive correlation
with most Th1 and Th2 cytokine levels, especially in IFNg (r = 0.537; p < 0.01), IL-2 (r = 0.592; p < 0.01), IL-10 (r =
0.381; p < 0.01) and IL-5 (r = 0.360; p < 0.01), while negative correlation with TNF-a (r = -0.405; p < 0.05). CD4+ T
lymphocyte count had significant negative correlation with
HIV viral load (r = -0.519; p < 0.01), IL-2 (r = -0.335; p <
0.01) and IL-5 (r = -0.317; p < 0.01) concentration, and
Th1/Th2 ratio (r = -0.236; p < 0.05). IFN-g, IL-2, IL-10,
Th1 cytokines levels and Th2 cytokines levels all had
strong positive correlations with the cytokine concentration except TNF-a. Moreover, TNF-a was the most insensitive immune cytokine which did not correlated with the
others except a negative correlation with HIV viral load
(r = -0.405; p < 0.05). As the proceeding of HAART, HIV
viral load was inhibited, CD4+ T lymphocyte count
aroused, TNF-a expression raised, the concentration of
IFN-g, IL-2, IL-5 and IL-10 progressively decreased. However, Th1 cytokine behaved more sensitive than Th2 cytokine under the effect of HAART. IFN-g secretion had a
strong and intense relationship with Th1 cytokine levels
(r = 0.969; p < 0.01), which indicated that IFN-g might
play an important role in Th1/Th2 balance.
Discussion
Although HIV co-infection clearly accelerates progression of HCV-related fibrosis and liver disease [35-38],
the role of HCV in HIV disease progression remains
controversial. HIV and HCV are intracellular parasites,
therefore T-cell responses are crucial for antiviral
defense and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) play a principal task by destructing infected cells [39,40]. Moreover,
viral gene expression can be suppressed by the antiviral
cytokines. Thus, both of the quantity and quality of T
cells are essential on disease pathology [41]. Cytokines
derived from CD4+ T cells play a prominent role in
viral infection, fostering elimination of intracellular
pathogen and promoting host viral responses including
CTL generation and natural killer cell activation (Th1),
or driving humoral immune responses and inhibit the
development of Th1 responses (Th2) [42]. Therefore, it
seems to be a delicate balance between the beneficial
and detrimental effects of HCV co-infection on the HIV
related disease progression and therapeutic results
which require further study.
To investigate the imbalance of Th1 and Th2 cytokines
in the peripheral blood of patients with HIV and/or HCV
infection, we evaluated the cytokine levels by using flow
cytometry in plasma, as well as the dynamic changes of
cytokine concentrations during HAART. We found that
HIV/HCV co-infected group had statistically higher CD4
+ T lymphocyte count, lower HIV viral load, and older
mean age than HIV mono-infected patients. This fact
may be an indirect evidence to support that co-infection
with HCV has no effect on the progression of HIV to
AIDS. We also found a higher detection level of HCV
RNA in the HCV/HIV co-infected group compared to

the HCV mono-infected group; these findings are consistent with other studies [43]. At the baseline level, coinfected with HCV can decrease the cytokine levels produced by both Th1 and Th2 cells comparing with HIV
mono-infection except IL-10; HIV mono-infection had
the highest Th1 immune responses by secreting IFN-g
compared with other groups; Th2 cytokine levels were
lower than Th1, demonstrated a profile dominated by
Th1 cytokines before HAART. HIV or HCV mono-infection with higher Th1 cytokine expressions may account
for a milder course of liver disease in HCV mono-infection [33,44]; Th1 to Th2 switch led to the contraction of
AIDS [45]. Therefore, we suggested that co-infection
with HIV didn’t worsen liver diseases by the performance
of cytokine levels.
HIV infection specifically depressed CD4+ T cell and
kept viral replication at high levels, which ultimately led to
AIDS syndromes. On the other hand, many studies found
that infected with HIV could cause cytokine expression of
Th1 to Th2 during progresses of AIDS. By analyzing the
former factors related with diseases progression. We found
that HIV/HCV co-infection group had lower Th1/Th2
ratio, the CD4+ T lymphocyte count and HIV viral load
was higher than HIV mono-infected group. Therefore, we
reached a conclusion that there’s no sufficient corroboration for that co-infected with HCV has negative effect on
HIV related diseases. As we mentioned before, the influence of HCV on HIV infected patients was probably in the
functional disorder of the T cells, which can not be determined by the quantity of cytokine levels. Infected with different viruses could lead to different characteristic
performances of Th1/Th2 imbalance. Contrasting with the
healthy control, the cytokine levels were dominated by Th1
cytokines in HIV mono-infection group, while in HCV
mono-infection the advantage of Th1 was replaced by Th2
cytokines, thus for co-infection group Th1/Th2 balance
was medium between the two mono-infections. These
findings were similar to the study of P. Price et al. [34],
which indicated that compared with single infected
patients, the T helper response of co-infected with HIV
and HCV was markedly reduced. Thus, co-infected with
HCV could cause a lower Th1/Th2 ratio by decreasing
Th1 cytokine expressions, especially in the IFN-g level.
HIV/HCV co-infection and HIV mono-infection group
presented differently after HAART. As HAART successfully inhibited HIV replication and elevated CD4+ T lymphocytes, the reactivity of Th1 and Th2 cells was changed
evidently from baseline. Co-infected with HCV seemed to
play a role in deregulating both Th1 and Th2 cytokine
expressions. Th1/Th2 balances in different study groups
during HAART were also performing in two different
ways, which implied co-infected with HCV affected mostly
on Th1 cytokine expressions leading to a progressive
decrease. The strong and positive correlation between HIV
viral load and Th1 and Th2 cytokine levels indicated that
HIV was an essential influencing factor on the reactivity of
Th1 and Th2 cells. Therefore, Th1 and Th2 cytokine levels
were reduced as HAART proceeding. As there’s no significant correlation between CD4+ T lymphocyte count and
Th1 and Th2 cytokine levels, we proposed the possible reason for increasing cytokine expression was the HIV itself. It
was the stimulation of the HIV protein on T cells that
caused the high cytokine expressions, which needed further
study to reveal the molecular mechanism of this effect.
Conclusions
In summary, this study investigated the differences of

infection and HIV or HCV mono-infection group as
well as the change of Th1/Th2 balance during HAART.
There was no significant evidence that co-infected with
HCV had any negative effects on HIV related diseases.
However, co-infected with HCV can decrease Th1/Th2
ratio by affecting Th1 cytokine expression. With initiating of HAART, Th1 and Th2 cytokine levels were progressively reduced. HIV was the main stimulation factor
of T cells in co-infection. Additional studies are needed
to illustrate the mechanism behind reduced HCV-specific T helper responses, as well as the clinical implications of reduced cytokine responses in co-infected
patients.
