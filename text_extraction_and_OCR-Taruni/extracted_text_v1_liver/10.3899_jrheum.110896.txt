Home Parenteral Nutrition in Patients with Systemic
Sclerosis: A Retrospective Review of 12 Cases
HANI JAWA, GAIL FERNANDES, OLIVIA SAQUI, and JOHANNE P. ALLARD
ABSTRACT. Objective. To evaluate the effect of home total parenteral nutrition (HTPN) on the nutritional and
functional status of patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc). 
Methods. Retrospective review of SSc patients from the HTPN database at the University Health
Network, Toronto, Canada, from 1998 to 2010.
Results: In total 12 subjects (9 females, 3 males) with SSc were identified. At initiation of HTPN,
the age was 48.75 ± 3.94 years and the median body mass index was 16.8 kg/m2 (range 12.3–21.3).
This significantly increased to 18.3 kg/m2 (17.0–21.7) at 6 months and to 19.7 kg/m2 (17.0–24.6) at
12 months. The mean Karnofsky score at baseline was 58.00 ± 3.27, and the score at 12 months of
39.00 ± 13.29 did not change significantly. 
Conclusion. HTPN improved the nutritional status of these patients with SSc but it did not improve
their functional status. (First Release March 1 2012; J Rheumatol 2012;39:1004–7; doi:10.3899/

Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a progressive, multisystem disorder that has significant morbidity and mortality1. About
50% to 90% of patients have gastrointestinal (GI) involvement, which includes gastroesophageal reflux disease, gastroparesis, intestinal pseudoobstruction, and malabsorption2. A recent study looking at 586 Canadian patients with
SSc revealed that 18% were at high risk of malnutrition with
significant correlates being disease duration, number of GI
complaints, diffuse disease, physician global assessment of
disease severity, hemoglobin, oral aperture, abdominal distention, and possible malabsorption3.
There is minimal literature providing guidance on how to
manage malnourished patients with SSc and on the effect of
home total parenteral nutrition (HTPN) on nutritional characteristics, functional status, and survival in patients with
SSc. The aim of our study was to evaluate these outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients. Charts of University Health Network patients receiving HTPN
were reviewed from 1998 to 2010, and 12 subjects with SSc were identified. These subjects were either already receiving HTPN or started HTPN
during the study period. For HTPN, patients were assessed by a multidisciplinary nutrition support team consisting of a dietitian, pharmacist, nurse,
and physician. The criteria for acceptance into the HTPN program included the inability to maintain a normal nutritional status due to intestinal failure from underlying SSc. This was assessed by the physician who investigated and made the diagnosis of intestinal failure. All patients with SSc had
significant GI involvement with gastroesophageal reflux disease, gastroparesis, and intestinal pseudoobstruction.
The nutritional status of all patients was assessed using the Subjective
Global Assessment (SGA), which is a well validated tool for screening malnutrition based on features of history and physical examination. Patients
were classified as well nourished (SGA-A), moderately malnourished
(SGA-B), or severely malnourished (SGA-C)4.
Data collected from the HTPN registry and clinical monitoring include
demographics, body mass index (BMI) in kg/m2, hemoglobin values, blood
biochemistry, and quality of life (QOL) scores. For blood biochemistry, the
following were measured using standard hospital methods: Serum albumin
(normal range 38–50 g/l), plasma creatinine (normal range 50–98 µmol/l),
alanine aminotransferase (normal range 7–40 U/l), aspartate aminotransferase (normal range 5–34 U/l), and alkaline phosphatase (normal range
40–150 U/l) were measured using the Architect c8000 system (Abbott
Laboratories Ltd., Saint-Laurent, Quebec, Canada).
The functional status of patients with SSc taking HTPN was assessed
by the Karnofsky score5 in order to measure the level of patient activity and
medical care requirements. The Karnofsky performance score ranges from
0 to 100, where 0 indicates a patient is deceased and 100 indicates a patient
has normal functioning with no evidence of active disease. The Karnofsky
score was measured by the HTPN nurse. Survival rate while taking HTPN
was also assessed.
Our study was approved by the Research Ethics Board, University
Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
Statistical analysis. Data collected from the HTPN registry were entered
into a Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp., USA) spreadsheet, and subsequently transferred to the statistical program SPSS (Version 16.0; SPSS,
Chicago, IL, USA) for analysis. Preliminary exploratory analysis examined
the normality of data for the continuous variables. Descriptive statistics are
reported as median (range) or percentage of population. Friedman test was

done to compare the 3 timepoints for clinical and biochemical data. Where
there was a significant difference, Wilcoxon signed-ranks test was done to
compare baseline to 6 months and baseline to 12 months. In addition, survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS
In total, 12 patients with scleroderma were enrolled in the
HTPN program at our center between 1998 and 2010. Their
baseline characteristics are described in Table 1. All the
patients in the study had SSc by American College of
Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for classification of SSc, and
GI involvement. However, patients had varying degrees of
severity of SSc. The main indication for HTPN was poor
nutritional status as a result of chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction and bacterial overgrowth of the small intestine that
did not improve with dietary and pharmacologic interventions such as prokinetics and cyclic antibiotics. The mean
age of patients with SSc requiring HTPN was 48.75 ± 3.94
years and the majority of patients were female (9/12).
Eleven patients had sclerodactyly, only 1 patient had normal
skin, 2 patients had renal involvement, 3 patients had cardiac involvement, and 4 patients had varying degrees of pulmonary involvement.
Caloric intake, as assessed by the TPN dietitian, was poor
in all patients despite maximum medical treatment. In some
patients enteral nutrition was started, with no success
because of their underlying severe intestinal pseudoobstruction (details not available for all patients). In 1 patient, a gastrojejunal tube had been placed, but was subsequently
removed because of significant local discomfort related to
skin tightness.
Eight patients out of the 12 were underweight with BMI
< 18.5 kg/m2. Four patients had normal BMI at baseline. All
patients were deemed to be moderately to severely malnourished (SGA-B in 4 patients and SGA-C in 8 patients).
Therefore, all SSc patients referred for HTPN met entry criteria, and patients were admitted for HTPN.
In patients receiving HTPN, weight increased significantly over the period of 12 months (Table 2). Median BMI
increased in 6 months on HTPN from 16.8 kg/m2 (range
12.3–21.3) to 18.3 kg/m2 (17.0–21.7) (p < 0.001) and further increased to 19.7 kg/m2 (17.0–24.6) at 12 months
(Table 2). At baseline 7/12 (58%) patients had albumin level
< 35 g/l. At 6 months, albumin increased from 31 g/l (range
22–40) to 34 g/l (25–43), and further increased to 36 g/l
(25–49) at 12 months. Individual BMI and albumin measurements are shown in Figure 1. There was no significant
change in liver enzymes and bilirubin. The mean hemoglobin at HTPN initiation was 99.1 g/l (range 80–135).
Mean Karnofsky score at baseline was 58.00 ± 3.27;
although there was a decrease in score at 12 months to 39.00
± 13.29, this did not reach significance (p = 0.222).
Within the first year of HTPN initiation, 1 of 12 patients
died from complications related to SSc, 10 patients continued receiving HTPN, and in 1 patient HTPN was tapered
and switched to enteral feeding. Within 2 years from HTPN
initiation, a total of 5 patients died, all from causes related
to SSc and not related to TPN. Therefore, the 2-year survival
was 58%. Overall, looking at the entire HTPN duration,
including the first 12 months after initiation, HTPN duration
ranged between 5 and 270 months. The mean survival while
receiving HTPN was 228.8 ± 29.2 months. If we exclude a
patient with mild SSc who had pseudoobstruction and survived 270 months on HTPN, the mean survival was 72.6 ±
9.9 months. As fewer than half the subjects had died at the
end of 2 years, median survival could not be determined.
DISCUSSION
Results from our study indicate that HTPN improved nutritional status of patients with SSc but did not improve functional status, and observed survival at 2 years was only 58%.
Very few studies have investigated the effects of HTPN
on patients with SSc. Ng, et al reported successful HTPN
therapy in 15 patients with severe bowel disease related to
SSc, including intestinal pseudoobstruction, malabsorption,
and malnutrition6. In that study, line complications and survival were reported. With 15,700 catheter-use days there
were only 2 episodes of septicemia and 2 episodes of superior vena cava obstruction. The authors reported improved
QOL, but a specific QOL assessment tool was not described.
Seven patients died, likely from SSc complications unrelated to GI disease or parenteral nutrition. Brown, et al confirmed the longterm safety of HTPN for SSc-related intestinal failure; however, in that study, the effect on nutritional
characteristics and QOL was not examined7. In our study,
we did not record HTPN-related complications such as line
infection as this was not well recorded in patients’ charts.
Measurements of nutritional status in patients with SSc
can be challenging due to the effect of the underlying disease on anthropometric characteristics based on skin elasticity (skin-fold measurements), or plasma proteins that can be
affected by renal function. In our patients, we found significant gain in BMI despite the small sample size. Although
SGA was performed at baseline, repeated assessments were
not recorded in patients’ charts.
Regarding albumin, a significant increase was seen on
HTPN, suggesting improvement in nutritional status.
Although this was small and did not normalize, this

increase was likely a reflection of improved nutrition, since
these patients were clinically stable and also presented concomitant weight gain while receiving HTPN. Albumin has
its limitation as a nutritional marker because it may be
affected by factors such as infection, liver synthetic dysfunction, and renal losses of protein. Recently, research
from the Canadian Scleroderma Research Group stated that
albumin was not a useful marker for malnutrition in SSc
patients8.
In our study, we did not see a significant effect of HTPN
on functional status of SSc patients as assessed by the
Karnofsky scoring system. We should note that this score
has never been validated in SSc. Also, it is possible that
HTPN in these patients may have improved other QOL
aspects not assessed by the Karnofsky score.
Our observed 2-year survival rate was 58%. For those
who died, the primary cause of death was not TPN-related
but reported to be SSc-related by their primary physicians.
Since these patients died at different hospital centers scattered throughout the Province of Ontario, it was not possible
to get specific information related to their deaths. In some of
our patients, the disease progressed rapidly and involved
multiple organs, resulting in death secondary to pulmonary,
cardiac, or renal failure. In other patients, although SSc disease may have involved various organs, it remained relatively stable for long periods of time. One patient with SSc
had cardiac involvement and pulmonary hypertension and
died within 1 year of HTPN initiation, with the other 4 dying
in the second year of HTPN. On the other hand, another
patient with SSc with the longest survival on HTPN (270
months) had no significant organ involvement except for GI
involvement.
In patients with SSc, there is a disparity in the number of
years lived. Our results are close to those of Amiot, et al,
who reported a 2-year survival rate of 37% in adults with
SSc and chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction receiving
HTPN9. A study conducted in 264 patients with diffuse cutaneous SSc from the Scleroderma Criteria Cooperative Study
from 1973 to 1977 showed that renal, cardiac, pulmonary,
and GI involvement in SSc predicted reduced survival10.
The poorest prospects for survival were patients < 64 years
of age with a hemoglobin level < 11 g/dl, and in those > 64
years old with a blood urea nitrogen level > 16 mg/dl. In a
more recent study in 309 French Canadians, Cox regression
revealed that independent predictors of mortality were skin
involvement of the trunk, age, carbon monoxide diffusion
capacity of the lungs ≤ 70% of normal value, erythrocyte
sedimentation rate ≥ 25 mm/h, and hemoglobin level ≤ 125
g/dl11. All but 1 patient in our population had hemoglobin
values ≤ 125 g/dl at HTPN initiation (mean 99.1 g/l).
Although we did not compare SSc patients receiving to
those not receiving HTPN, our study may support findings
by Grabowski and Grant that adequate nutritional support
does not alter the natural history of systemic scleroderma12.
However, HTPN may help avoid progressive debilitation
due to nutritional depletion.
There are limitations to our study. Although the data from
the HTPN registry were collected prospectively, these
results are based on a retrospective review of the HTPN registry along with patients’ charts. In addition, the number of
patients was small because very few patients with SSc are
referred to the HTPN program. It is not clear whether this is
due to the rarity of significant malnutrition or to the fact that
malnutrition is underrecognized. Considering that 18% of
SSc patients are reported to be at high risk of malnutrition,
it is possible that nutrition support (enteral or parenteral) is
underprescribed. Longterm complications from HTPN such
as cholestasis, osteoporosis, and frequency of line infections
were not assessed. Also, not all independent predictors of
mortality were examined because of the retrospective design
of this study and the small number of patients.
The use of HTPN was beneficial in improving the nutritional status of patients with SSc but did not improve performance status, and patients’ survival remained low.
