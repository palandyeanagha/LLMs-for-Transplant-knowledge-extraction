Abstract
Background: The most common sites of recurrence after liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
have been reported to be the liver, lung, bone, and adrenal glands, but there have also been many reports of cases
of multiple recurrence. The prognosis after recurrence is poor, with reported median survival after recurrence of
HCC ranging from 9 to 19 months. Here, we report a case of long-term survival after recurrence of pharyngeal
metastasis following living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT) for HCC within the Milan criteria, by resection of the
metastatic region and cervical lymph node dissection.
Case presentation: A 47-year-old man with a Model End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score of 11 underwent LDLT
for HCC within the Milan criteria for liver cirrhosis associated with hepatitis B virus infection, with his 48-year-old
elder brother as the living donor. One year and 10 months after liver transplantation, he visited a nearby hospital
with a chief complaint of discomfort on swallowing. A pedunculated polyp was found in the hypopharynx, and
biopsy revealed HCC metastasis. We performed pharyngeal polypectomy. Two years later, cervical lymph node
metastasis appeared, and neck lymph node dissection was performed. Although recurrence subsequently occurred
three times in the grafted liver, the patient is still alive 12 years and 10 months after recurrence of pharyngeal
metastasis. He is now a tumor-free outpatient taking sorafenib.
Conclusion: It is necessary to recognize that the nasopharyngeal region is a potential site of HCC metastasis.
Prognostic improvement can be expected with close follow-up, early detection, and multidisciplinary treatment,
including radical resection.

Background
In 1996, Mazzaferro et al. reported that when liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was restricted to patients with early-stage disease (defined as a
single tumor less than 5 cm in diameter, or up to three
tumors less than 3 cm in diameter, without vascular invasion or extrahepatic metastasis), the 4-year survival
rate was 75%, similar to survival rates for patients with
non-HCC liver disease [1]. These criteria, which were
soon termed the “Milan criteria,” became the worldwide
benchmark for liver transplantation criteria for HCC.
The Milan criteria, limiting the indications for liver
transplantation for HCC, have reduced the postoperative
recurrence rate of HCC. However, HCC still recurs in
1.6–13% of recipients within the Milan criteria after liver
transplantation [1–6]. There have been many reports of
cases with multiple instances of recurrence due to systemic recurrence caused by extra-hepatic circulating
tumor cells. The prognosis after recurrence of HCC is
poor, with reported median survival ranging from 9 to
19 months in major transplant centers in both Western
and Eastern countries [4, 7–12]. However, if the recurrence remains local, such as within the liver, lung, or adrenal gland, surgical resection may improve prognosis,
and cases of long-term survival have been reported [4,
6–8, 10, 11, 13]. Here, we report a case of long-term survival after resection of the pharyngeal metastasis due to
HCC recurrence after living-donor liver transplantation
(LDLT).
Case presentation
A 47-year-old man with a Model End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score of 11 and liver cirrhosis associated
with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection underwent LDLT
for HCC, with his 48-year-old elder brother as the living
donor, in November 2004. He had received transarterial
chemoembolization (TACE) 5 months before liver transplantation and was assessed as having a partial response
according to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria
in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) [14]. The patient had no
history of other diseases, and there were also no diseases
of note in his family history. The right lobe of the donor
was harvested and weighed 710 g (graft-to-recipient
weight ratio, 1.09). The donor and recipient had the
same blood type. Preoperative abdominal computed
tomography (CT) revealed liver cirrhosis with three
hypervascular nodules, diagnosed as HCC, which were
2.0, 2.5, and 2.8 cm in diameter and met the Milan criteria (Fig. 1a). Preoperative tumor marker levels were as
follows: α-fetoprotein (AFP), 5 ng/ml; and des- -

carboxy prothrombin (DCP), 327 mAU/ml. Pathological
examination of the resected liver revealed one moderately differentiated HCC with necrotic change in a 2.4-cm
area, and multiple well-differentiated HCC lesions measuring a few millimeters that appeared to indicate multicentric
occurrence. Microvascular invasion was not seen (Fig. 1b, c,
d). We used tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)
as posttransplant immunosuppressive agents; no steroids
were employed. The early postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged 74 days postoperatively. He received epirubicin at a dose of 10 mg/m2 during
surgery, but did not receive postoperative chemotherapy.
He was followed up by abdominal ultrasonography (US)
every 3 months and by abdominal CT at 1, 3, 6, and 12
months after surgery, and every 6 months thereafter. The
AFP and DCP levels were checked monthly. Lamivudine
was administered to control HBV virus, and HBV DNA
was consistently negative after transplantation. In September 2006, 22 months after LDLT, he visited a nearby hospital with a chief complaint of discomfort on swallowing. A
pedunculated polyp was found in the hypopharynx (Fig.
2a), and biopsy revealed HCC metastasis. Cervical CT revealed a pharyngeal polyp on the right side of the epiglottis;
also, faint fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) accumulation was recognized, consistent with a pharyngeal polyp on FDG positron emission tomography (PET)-CT examination (Fig. 2b,
c). Polypectomy was performed on October 2006.
Histological examination revealed that the tumor cells
were positive for anti-hepatocyte antigen staining and a
diagnosis of metastasis of HCC was made (Fig. 2d, e).
He was administered tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil (TS-1)
after polypectomy. Two years after pharyngeal polypectomy, recurrence in neck lymph nodes was detected
(Fig. 2f, g), and neck lymph node dissection was performed. Recurrence subsequently occurred three times
in the graft liver, and local treatment with TACE and
radiofrequency ablation therapy was performed. The
patient was started on oral sorafenib 3 years ago, is still
alive 12 years and 10 months after recurrence of
pharyngeal metastasis, and is now a tumor-free outpatient in good health continuing to take a low dose of
sorafenib (Fig. 3).
Discussion
Liver transplantation is the only curative treatment for
HCC associated with severe liver cirrhosis [15–17]. The
critical shortage of deceased donor organs has led to the
rapid development of LDLT in Eastern countries, including
Japan, Korea, and China. And in contrast to deceased donor
liver transplantation, recipient selection for LDLT is not
limited by organ allocation systems. Subsequently, many
centers have developed expanded center-specific criteria

with acceptable results, including the University of California San Francisco criteria, Extended Toronto criteria, and
Kyoto criteria and others [18–24].
A major issue with liver transplantation for HCC is
that recurrence of HCC is associated with a high risk of
death within a short time. The prognosis after recurrence is very poor, with reported median survival times
ranging from 9 to 19 months [4, 7–11]. No effective
postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for HCC after liver
transplantation has been established. To date, the best
outcomes have been achieved by limiting the indications
for transplantation according to tumor status. The Milan
criteria have become the global standard guidelines for
liver transplantation for HCC. Nevertheless, rates of
recurrence of HCC within the Milan criteria after liver
transplantation have been reported to be 1.6–13% [1–6].
The most commonly reported initial sites of local
recurrence after liver transplantation for HCC are the
grafted liver (15%), lung (20–30%), bone (20–25%),
abdominal lymph node (15%), and adrenal glands (5%)
[2–4, 10, 25]. However, the rate of initial recurrence in
multiple sites was reported to be approximately 40%
when systemic recurrence is promoted by circulating
tumor cells; solitary recurrence is very rare, except at
those sites [2, 9, 10, 25]. There are seven published cases
of pharyngeal metastasis from HCC, which are summarized along with our case in Table 1 [26–32]. The reports all describe male patients with a median age of 70
years (range 49–71 years). Four cases of synchronous
metastasis and four cases of metachronous metastasis
have been reported. The time between the first treatment and pharyngeal metastasis was 17–58 months in
cases of metachronous metastasis. Five patients, including our case, underwent surgery for pharyngeal metastases. The prognosis for all cases except ours was poor;
four died within 1 year, two underwent difficult curative
treatment, and one experienced multiple recurrences of
pharyngeal metastasis at 1 year after surgery [28–32]. Our
report is the second to describe solitary recurrence in the
pharyngeal region after liver transplantation and includes
the longest surviving case of HCC with pharyngeal
metastasis.
The mechanism of metastasis to the pharyngeal region
is controversial, although it has been speculated that there
are two main pathways: tumor cells may circulate through
the vena cava and be distributed to the pharyngeal region
via the arterial systemic circulation, or may reach the head
and neck by bypassing the lungs, possibly through the
portal–vertebral venous plexus (Batson’s theory) [33]. The
vertebral venous plexus consists of the internal vertebral
venous system distributed around the spinal canal, the external vertebral venous plexus distributed in front of the
vertebral body, and the vertebral vein that anastomoses
both of those sites. This plexus communicates with the
intercostal vein and the azygos vein in each site. In the
head and neck region, the plexus communicates with the
pterygium venous plexus, cavernous venous plexus, and
pharyngeal venous plexus around the nasal and paranasal

Tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil were used as posttransplant immunosuppressive agents, with no steroid administration. Epirubicin was
administered during surgery. Pharyngeal metastasis occurred at 1 year and 10 months after LDLT. In addition, at 2 years after pharyngeal
polypectomy, recurrence of HCC was detected in the regional neck lymph nodes. Recurrence subsequently occurred three times in the grafted
liver, and local treatment with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization and radiofrequency ablation therapy were performed. The patient took
TS-1 orally after pharyngeal polypectomy for approximately 1 year and 6 months, and oral administration of sorafenib was started after the
second liver graft recurrence

sinuses [34]. As there is no venous valve in the vertebral
vein, the blood is thought to easily flow backward when
the intrathoracic pressure or abdominal pressure rises
[33]. HCC metastasis through the portal vein is considered
to be common, such that tumor cells that have entered
the vertebral vein plexus from the portal vein flow back
to the pharyngeal venous plexus due to an increase of
intraperitoneal pressure, and metastasize to the pharynx [33–35]. In this case, metastasis first occurred as a
pharyngeal polyp, and recurrence occurred in the regional
lymph node on the same side 2 years later. During this
time, metastasis to other organs, including the lungs, did
not occur; thus, it was strongly suspected that it had
spread to the pharynx via the vertebral vein plexus of
Baston. In 2005, Oida et al. reviewed 10 cases of HCC
with pharyngeal metastasis (non-English articles included)
[28]. In addition, Hou et al. reported 30 cases of HCC metastasis in the gingival region [36]. Collectively, these cases
imply that oral cavity and nasopharyngeal metastasis via
the portal-vertebral venous plexus represent a primary
HCC metastatic pathway.
The Milan criteria are based on the size and number
of HCCs. In addition to tumor size and number, the
grade of histological differentiation, microvascular invasion, and underestimation of HCC burden based on
preoperative imaging are reported to be associated with
recurrence [2, 4, 37, 38]. Furthermore, there is an increased desire for further information on tumor biology
and surrogates of tumor biology when determining
transplant suitability. Consequently, some transplantation centers include tumor markers in their patient
evaluations, such as AFP and DCP, the levels of which
are correlated with HCC recurrence rate [2, 20, 39]. The
HCC response to pretransplant locoregional therapy is
an important surrogate marker for survival, as well as an
indicator of tumor biology. Some authors reported that
the 5-year overall survival rate and recurrence rate were
significantly associated with pretransplant treatment for
HCC [40, 41]. In this case, pretransplant TACE for HCC
resulted in a partial response, small multiple welldifferentiated HCCs that appeared to represent multicentric occurrence were observed during pathological
examination, and the DCP level was high preoperatively.
Therefore, this case fell within the Milan criteria based
on preoperative imaging, but the risk of recurrence was
considered high.
Even if the vertebral vein system develops as a collateral
pathway, this does not manifest in any specific symptom,
and its recognition as a transportal-vertebral metastatic
pathway remains poor. In addition, metastasis in
pharyngeal regions is difficult to detect because such regions represent the border between the head and chest on
CT examinations. Metastasis in pharyngeal regions may be
missed by common follow-up imaging procedures, such as
US and CT, such that recurrence may be discovered only
after metastasis to other sites. Early detection is the only
factor associated with effective treatment after recurrence.
Careful follow-up involving the analysis of tumor markers
and imaging analysis of frequent metastatic recurrence
sites, including the pharyngeal and cervical regions, are important, especially in high-risk patients.
Over the last decade, we have significantly improved
our understanding of the molecular landscape of HCC
[42]. Numerous studies have investigated the utility of
molecular biomarkers, such as DNA alterations, to predict outcomes in patients following liver transplantation

for HCC [42]. Circulating miRNA has emerged as one of
the most attractive tools for the early diagnosis of cancers [42–44]. Some authors have reported that miRNA
markers were useful predictors of HCC recurrence after
liver transplantation [42, 45–47]. In the near future, it is
expected that the understanding of tumor biology will
advance through further analysis of these molecular
mechanisms, facilitating individual risk stratification
for HCC patients who will benefit from liver
transplantation [42].
The concept of oligorecurrence, introduced by Hellman
and Weichselbaum in 1995, suggests that survival is improved by aggressive local treatment depending on the
number and location of recurrent tumors [48]. Extrahepatic
recurrence of HCC often occurs at local sites after liver
resection, and survival can be prolonged by surgical resection in such cases [49, 50]. Even after liver transplantation,
prolongation of survival can be expected if radical resection
is performed for local recurrence [4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13].
Although there are no strict surgical indications for HCC
recurrence after liver transplantation, the recurrence time
following liver transplantation is 12–24 months or more;
the prognosis of surgery for recurrence is good [4, 10, 13].
Other prognostic factors have been revealed, such as an
AFP level of 100 ng/ml or greater, bone metastasis,
three or more tumors, and tumor size at the time of
recurrence [8, 10, 11, 13]. About 10–23% of patients
with recurrence survive for a long time after surgical
therapy [6, 8, 51]. The median survival of unresectable cases was reported to be 5–15 months, while that
of resectable cases with local recurrence was reported
to be 28–65 months; cases of long-term survival after
resection of the grafted liver, lung, and adrenal metastasis have also been reported [52–55].
The factor responsible for the favorable clinical
course in our case is thought to be that surgery could
be performed easily to treat pharyngeal recurrence because of the pedunculated polyp-like shape at the site
of recurrence, and radical resection of subsequent
lymph node recurrence was possible. In addition, we
used a steroid-free postoperative immunosuppressant
regimen. After recurrence of HCC, TS-1 and sorafenib
were used as antitumor agents. Several studies have
indicated that immunosuppressant therapy including
steroid can impact HCC recurrence after liver transplantation [56]. The mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) inhibitors sirolimus and everolimus have been
reported to be effective as immunosuppressants after
liver transplantation for HCC [57, 58]. However, data
on the utility of mTOR inhibitors for treating HCC recurrence after liver transplantation remain scarce [48].
Recently, new anticancer and molecular targeted drugs,
such as sorafenib, regorafenib, lenvatinib, ramucirumab,
and nivolumab, have been clinically applied to treat HCC.
The efficacy of these drugs for treating recurrence after
liver transplantation for HCC has been studied; several reports indicated prolongation of survival, but there is no
established therapeutic regimen and there is some concern
regarding adverse effects on liver function [59–62]. Clinical
trials of chemotherapy for patients with HCC recurrence
and/or postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for patients
at high risk of recurrence after liver transplantation are
required [63].
Conclusion
In summary, we have reported a rare case of pharyngeal
metastasis following LDLT for HCC. The cervical region
must be recognized as a primary site of extrahepatic metastasis of HCC via the portal–vertebral venous plexus. Even
with recurrence in the pharyngeal region, patients can
achieve long-term survival, as in the present case. Early
diagnosis of recurrence via careful periodic follow-up examinations of the cervical to nasopharyngeal region, together
with frequent sites of metastatic recurrence such as the
lungs, grafted liver, adrenal glands, bone, and abdominal
lymph nodes, is required. At present, there is no established
immunotherapy or adjuvant chemotherapy after liver transplantation that suppresses HCC recurrence. In addition, the
effectiveness of surgical treatment for the oligo-recurrence
of HCC after liver transplantation has been reported,
but there is no effective treatment for multiple recurrences. Multidisciplinary treatment with radical resection and various subsequent treatments, including
immunosuppressive treatment and anti-tumor therapy,
are also needed according to the patient’s condition.
