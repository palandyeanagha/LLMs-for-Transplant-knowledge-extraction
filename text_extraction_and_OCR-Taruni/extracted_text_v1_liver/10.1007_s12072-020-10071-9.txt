Abstract
Background Liver function derangements have been reported in coronavirus disease (COVID-19), but reported rates are 
variable.
Methods We searched PubMed and Embase with terms COVID and SARS-COV-2 from December 1, 2019 till April 5, 
2020. We estimated overall prevalence, stratifed prevalence based on severity, estimated risk ratio (RR), and estimated 
standardized mean diference (SMD) of liver function parameters in severe as compared to non-severe COVID. Random 
efect method utilizing inverse variance approach was used for pooling the data.
Results In all, 128 studies were included. The most frequent abnormalities were hypoalbuminemia [61.27% (48.24–72.87)], 
elevations of gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) [27.94% (18.22–40.27)], alanine aminotransferase (ALT) [23.28% (19.92–
27.01)], and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) [23.41% (18.84–28.70)]. Furthermore, the relative risk of these abnormalities was higher in the patients with severe COVID-19 when compared to non-severe disease [Hypoalbuminemia—2.65 
(1.38–5.07); GGT—2.31 (1.6–3.33); ALT—1.76 (1.44–2.15); AST—2.30 (1.82–2.90)]. The SMD of hypoalbuminemia, 
GGT, ALT, and AST elevation in severe as compared to non-severe were −1.05 (−1.27 to −0.83), 0.76 (0.40–1.12), 0.42 
(0.27–0.56), and 0.69 (0.52–0.86), respectively. The pooled prevalence and RR of chronic liver disease as a comorbidity 
was 2.64% (1.73–4) and 1.69 (1.05–2.73) respectively.

Conclusion The most frequent abnormality in liver functions was hypoalbuminemia followed by derangements in gammaglutamyl transferase and aminotransferases, and these abnormalities were more frequent in severe disease. The systematic 
review was, however, limited by heterogeneity in defnitions of severity and liver function derangements.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was frst brought to 
light with the appearance of cases of viral pneumonia in 
December 2019 in Wuhan city of the Chinese Hubei province [1]. Since then, the disease has spread globally and 
is recognized as a global pandemic by the World Health 
Organization (WHO). The disease, caused by severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has 
been responsible for large numbers of hospital admissions 
and mortality, resulting in a severe stress on health care 
resources. With time, the understanding of the disease has 
also improved and it has become apparent that it involves 
not just the pulmonary system but also the gastrointestinal 
system, heart, and the liver [2].
The hepatic involvement has been well recognized in the 
two recent pathogenic coronaviruses, i.e., SARS-COV and 
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERSCOV). These two viruses had striking genetic similarity 
(especially SARS-COV) with the novel coronavirus, i.e., 
SARS-CoV-2 and, therefore, hepatic involvement in this is 
not entirely unexpected [3]. Indeed, multiple reports have 
suggested that elevation of liver transaminases does occur

with the infection of SARS-CoV-2. The purported mechanisms include the possibility of direct efect of the virus 
on hepatocytes or biliary epithelium, liver injury related to 
accentuated immune response (cytokine storm) and immune 
mediated damage, drug toxicity (because of drugs like acetaminophen, antivirals and hydroxychloroquine), and ischemic 
hepatitis which could occur in patients having multiorgan 
dysfunction including hemodynamic instability [4]. The 
biliary epithelium expresses the angiotensin-converting 
enzyme (ACE-2) receptor which is the known binding site 
of SARS-CoV-2, while the expression in hepatocytes is possibly much lower. However, the receptor expression has been 
shown to be upregulated in animals’ models of liver injury 
[4].
The literature regarding hepatic involvement in COVID19 is heterogenous with variability in the defnitions of liver 
dysfunction and diferences in the clinical presentation and 
disease severity of patients included in the published reports 
[5, 6]. Therefore, we planned to systematically study the 
occurrence of liver injury in COVID-19 and also determine 
the frequency of liver involvement in COVID-19. We also 
planned to identify any diferences in frequency of liver dysfunction with varying disease severity, and identify diferences in frequency of liver dysfunction in COVID-19 vis-avis non-COVID disease and also the frequency of underlying 
liver as a comorbidity in COVID-19 disease.
Materials and methods
We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis as 
per the guidance provided by the PRISMA statement [7].
Search and study selection
We searched PubMed and Embase on 5th April 2019 for 
publications using the keywords ‘COVID”, “Novel coronavirus” or “SARS-CoV-2” for all publications after 1st 
December 2019. No other restrictions for language or ethnicity or type of papers were used. The detailed search strategy 
is shown in Supplementary Table 1. The results obtained 
from the two databases were then combined and duplicates 
removed. Two reviewers (PKM, SM) separately did a title 
and abstract screening to select any studies reporting on data 
about underlying hepatic comorbidities or liver dysfunction. 
The studies selected for full-text screening were seen by two 
authors (SM and VS) for data extraction. Three other authors 
checked the data for accuracy and completeness (DKJ, JS, 
and AC). The bibliography of selected papers and relevant 
reviews were also sought to identify any additional eligible 
papers and an additional search was done using the original 
search terms AND “Liver” (both databases) to identify any 
additional papers as on 23rd April 2020. The detailed fow 
of the study selection is shown using the PRISMA fowchart 
(Fig. 1).
Selection of studies
Two investigators (VS and SM) separately determined if 
the studies were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis 
and the disagreements were discussed with the third author 
(PKM) for fnal decision.
We included studies (1) reporting on frequency of various liver function abnormalities including serum bilirubin, 
alanine aminotransferases (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), or gamma-glutamyl 
transferase (GGT) in human patients infected with SARSCoV-2, (2) reporting their median/mean levels for severe 
and non-severe disease or (3) reporting the frequency of 
underlying liver disease as a comorbidity in patients with 
COVID-19.
These studies were included irrespective of age, gender, ethnicity of the reported population, the study designs 
(cohort, case series, randomized trials), and the language 
of publication. We excluded the studies (1) if number of 
patients were<5, (2) if studies did not have confrmed cases 
of COVID-19, (3) if none of the relevant liver functions or 
data on liver disease as a comorbidity were reported, and (4) 
study designs like comments, editorials, reviews and systematic reviews which did not provide primary data. These studies were, however, looked at to identify additional papers 
from bibliography.
Study groups and analysis plan
We planned to fnd the pooled prevalence of liver function abnormalities in cases of COVID-19 and compare 
the frequencies of liver derangements between severe and 
non-severe COVID-19. We also planned to compare the 
frequencies of liver derangements between COVID cases 
and non-COVID cases if such data were available. We also 
planned to determine the pooled prevalence of underlying 
liver disease in patients with COVID-19 and compare if this 
frequency was diferent between severe and non-severe disease and between COVID and non-COVID disease. Additionally, we planned to compare the standard mean diference between severe and non-severe COVID and COVID 
and non-COVID cases.
Data extraction
We extracted data as per: authors, location of study, type 
of study, type of included patients, number of included 
patients, frequency of various hepatic derangements (elevation of serum bilirubin, ALT, AST, GGT, ALP, serum 
albumin) in patients with COVID-19 and separately for 

714 Hepatology International (2020) 14:711–722

those with severe and non-severe disease, mean/median 
values with standard deviation/interquartile range/range 
of these parameters from studies which compared severe 
and non-severe disease and also COVID and non-COVID 
cases. The details regarding the defnition of disease severity in each study and details of defnition of acute hepatic 
injury (or hepatic dysfunction) were also extracted.
Statistical analysis
The statistical analysis was performed using R statistical 
software (version 3.6.1) [8]. In addition to the base package, meta, readxl, and ggplot2 packages were used [9–11]. 
The number of events were summarized as events per 
100 observations. The inverse variance method with logit

transformation along with Clopper Pearson confidence 
interval for individual studies was used for the meta-analytic pooled prevalence in the overall and subgroup population. For diference in prevalence between subgroups, the 
inverse variance method was used for summarizing. A continuity correction of 0.5 was applied for studies with zero 
cell frequency. For continuous variable standardized mean 
diferences (SMD) were computed between the evaluated 
subgroups and inverse variance method was used for summarizing. Hedges’s g correction was used for bias correction 
of standardized mean diferences. For studies reporting mean 
and standard deviation, we directly took the reported values 
for analysis. For studies reporting median and interquartile 
range or median and range, the mean and standard deviation 
were computed from the reported values based on Luo 2018 
and Wan 2014 methodology [12, 13]. For studies reporting 
only mean along with p value, the t statistics were computed, 
which was then used for calculation of standard deviation. 
For studies reporting individual data, we computed mean 
and SD from the data. Heterogeneity of prevalence, RR, and 
SMD were tested with p value of heterogeneity (p<0.10) 
and I

 value was taken for reporting for 
heterogeneity as, in addition to quantifying heterogeneity, 
it also assesses the impact of heterogeneity on the metaanalysis. Random efects models were used for summarizing 
results irrespective of heterogeneity. For prevalence, 95% C.I 
of pooled prevalence was reported. For studies comparing 
prevalence and SMD between two groups, p value of<0.05 
was considered statistically signifcant and 95% confdence 
intervals (CIs) were reported. The forest plots were constructed for visualization of results.
Results
Search results and included studies
The search yielded a total of 6053 citations and additional 28 
papers were identifed from other sources like bibliography 
search. After removal of 2206 duplicates, 3875 papers were 
screened for title and abstract. After removal of 3559 papers 
for various reasons (Fig. 1), a total of 316 papers were eligible for full-text screening. Eventually a total of 128 papers 
were included in at least one of the diferent analyses which 
were conducted as part of the meta-analysis (Supplementary 
Table 2).

Comparison between COVID and non‑COVID disease
The RR of ALT and AST abnormality in the COVID as 
compared to non-COVID subgroups were 1.09 (95% CI 
0.55–2.15; I

 21%) and 1.02 (0.45–2.30; 48%), both statistically non-signifcant (Figs. 2e and 3e). The SMD for 
SGPT and SGOT concentration between the COVID and 
non-COVID group were 0.18 (0.05–0.32; 0%) and 0.02 
(−0.47 to 0.52; 91%) (Figs. 2f and 3f). The SMD of bilirubin, GGT, and albumin concentration between COVID 
and non-COVID subgroups were −0.27 (−0.49 to −0.05, 
28%), 0.12 (− 0.24 to 0.48; 58%) and 0.82 (0.30–1.33; 
82%), respectively (Figs. 2e, 5e, 6e).
Hepatic histological fndings in COVID‑19
Only limited cases have reported fndings on liver histology using either post-mortem histology or liver biopsy in 
patients with COVID-19 and are tabulated in Supplementary Table 3. The fndings reported are non-specifc and 
include sinusoidal dilatation, mild activity in portal area, 
and lobules and occasional necrosis. It is unclear if these 
are a manifestation of virus mediated liver injury or due 
to other factors like drugs or immune injury.

COVID‑19 in liver transplant recipients
Some case reports and studies have reported the outcomes 
of COVID-19 in patients with liver transplant and are shown 
in Supplementary Table 4.
Discussion
In this systematic review, we found that the derangements 
of liver functions were frequently noted in patients with 
COVID-19. The most frequent abnormality noted was 
hypoalbuminemia followed by elevations of gamma-glutamyl transferase, aminotransferases, bilirubin, and alkaline 
phosphatase. Furthermore, when comparison of severe with 
non-severe COVID-19 cases was done, liver function abnormalities like hypoalbuminemia, GGT, and aminotransferase 
and bilirubin elevations were more frequent in those with 
severe disease. However, serum alkaline phosphatase elevations were not signifcantly higher in the severe group of 
patients. The pooled frequency of elevation of ALT and AST 
was similar in the overall COVID cases, but, interestingly, 
the prevalence of AST elevations was more than ALT in the 
severe COVID disease.
The most frequent abnormality noted in our meta-analysis was hypoalbuminemia. This is possibly related to the 
fact that albumin is a negative acute phase reactant rather

meta-analysis confrms that the liver enzyme elevations in 
COVID-19, even in the severe COVID category, are mildto-moderate in most of the cases. Although there are a few 
reports of aminotransferase elevation to a high degree (>10 
times of upper limit), this is an uncommon phenomenon 
[14, 15]. Furthermore, liver failure is exceedingly rare with 
only a single case report available in a patient who had 
severe COVID associated with use of multiple drugs and 
progression of liver function derangement after admission 
[14]. As of now, it is not possible to conclusively ascribe 
these elevations to be related to direct viral injury. Most of 
the studies included in our analysis reported use of multiple drugs like antibiotics, antivirals (lopinavir/ritonavir 
combination, arbidol, oseltamivir, favipiravir, remdesvir, 
hydroxychloroquine), and steroids. Many of these drugs 
could have contributed to occurrence of liver dysfunction 
after hospitalization. Furthermore, ischemia and immune 
mediated injury due to cytokine storm could be responsible 
for liver dysfunction in patients with severe COVID disease.
SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE-2 receptor for gaining entry 
into the cells including the type 2 alveolar epithelial cells 
in the lungs. Chai et al. analyzed the expression of ACE-2 
receptors in liver tissue and found that their expression on 
cholangiocytes (59.7%) was much stronger than on hepatocytes (2.6%) [16]. It has also been observed that ACE-2 
expression increases in hepatocytes, in cases of liver injury 
[4, 17]. At least, one report suggests that viral RNA could 
be detected in liver tissue raising the possibility of viral 
mediated liver injury [18]. On the other hand, Chu et al. 
demonstrated a signifcant replication of SARS-CoV-2 on

Huh7 (hepatic) cell lines. They also noted that cytopathic 
efects were seen in a minority of cases, cautioning against 
an over reliance on the same [19]. Yet, the limited histological reports available fail to demonstrate clear cytopathic 
changes of SARS-Cov-2 (See Supplementary Table 3). Furthermore, the comparison of liver function showed that most 
abnormalities were equally frequent in non-COVID disease 
suggesting the lack of any specifcity for the diagnosis of 
COVID.
Another interesting fnding was that the elevations in 
GGT were similar in frequency to elevations in aminotransferases and were higher than the elevations in alkaline 
phosphatase. Furthermore, the frequency of patients with 
elevation of GGT was higher in severe COVID disease when 
compared to non-severe disease, but this was not noted with 
alkaline phosphatase. The exact reason for this is unclear, 
but GGT is recognized as a surrogate marker for increased 
oxidative stress and chronic infammation [20]. It is uncertain if these elevations are related to acute infammatory 
stress or are a marker of biliary injury and this fnding needs 
further evaluation.
We also looked at the prevalence of underlying liver disease as a comorbidity in the patients with COVID-19 and 
compared the frequency of liver disease as a comorbidity 
in severe and non-severe COVID cases. We found that the 
underlying liver disease was found in a signifcant number of 
patients with COVID-19. However, the frequency of underlying liver disease was statistically not diferent between 
severe and non-severe diseases. Unfortunately, our metaanalysis cannot directly provide evidence regarding the 
efect of underlying liver disease on outcomes of disease 
or whether it predisposes to severe COVID illness. Furthermore, the group ‘total liver disease’ is also a heterogeneous 
group comprising chronic hepatitis B, non-alcoholic fatty 
liver disease, and chronic liver disease. Therefore, we also 
did additional analysis of the frequency of chronic liver disease and underlying hepatitis B separately, and the fndings 
regarding frequency of underlying liver disease in severe and 
non-severe COVID did not seem to change except that the 
relative risk of underlying chronic liver disease was more in 
those with severe COVID disease. The efect of COVID on 
patients with previous transplant has been reported infrequently and data are still unclear if these patients are at an 
increased risk of severe disease. (Supplementary Table 4).
There are some limitations to the current systematic 
review and meta-analysis. The most important concern is 
the variability in the defnitions of liver dysfunction or 
acute liver injury (Supplementary Table 5), diferences 
in the normal values of liver enzymes in various studies, 
and heterogeneity in defnition of severe and non-severe 
COVID groups, while most studies defned severe disease 
as per WHO criteria, many others have defned severe

disease as ICU admissions, non-survivors, etc. (Supplementary Table 6). This adds signifcant heterogeneity, 
because a study only on ICU patients (which compares 
survivors and non-survivors) is likely to have almost all 
cases qualifying to the WHO defnition of severity [1]. 
Similarly, although we compared the liver dysfunction in 
COVID and non-COVID disease, the analysis was limited 
by the small number of participating studies and heterogeneity in defnition of non-COVID cases in various reports. 
Furthermore, although some studies indicate that the elevation of liver enzymes is a delayed phenomenon and may 
occur in the second week of illness, we are not able to 
clarify if this is because of worsening infammation as part 
of disease course, or other factors like multiple drugs used 
in these patients [21]. Also, most of the included studies 
are from China, the country of initial impact of COVID19, and, therefore, may not be representative of diferences 
among various populations. Furthermore, the impact of 
COVID-19 on outcomes in patients with underlying liver 
disease is less clear. Some case reports have suggested 
that SARS-CoV2 could be the cause of acute deterioration 
in patients with underlying chronic liver disease, resulting in Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF) [22, 23]. 
However, there are multiple strengths of the meta-analysis, 
as we have compared multiple parameters of liver function, and for most of these, a fair number of studies were 
available. Also, the study clarifes the frequency of liver 
function abnormalities in severe and non-severe diseases. 
Furthermore, the pooled prevalence of underlying liver 
disease as a comorbidity has also been clarifed.
To conclude, liver function abnormalities, especially 
hypoalbuminemia, GGT, and aminotransferase elevations, 
are frequent in patients with COVID-19 disease and the 
patients with severe disease are more likely to have these 
liver function derangements.
