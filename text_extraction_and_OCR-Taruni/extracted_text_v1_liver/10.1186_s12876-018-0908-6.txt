Abstract
Background: To investigate the diagnostic performance of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte
ratio (NLR) as well as their combinations with other markers.
Methods: Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), AFP and levels as well as the
numbers of neutrophils and lymphocytes of all enrolled patients were collected. The NLR was calculated by
dividing the number of neutrophils by the number of lymphocytes. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve
analysis was conducted to determine the ability of each marker and combination of markers to distinguish HCC
and liver disease patients.
Results: In total, 545 patients were included in this study. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) values for AFP, ALT,
AST, and NLR were 0.775 (0.738–0.810), 0.504 (0.461–0.547), 0.660 (0.618–0.699), and 0.738 (0.699–0.774) with optimal
cut-off values of 24.6 ng/mL, 111 IU/mL, 27 IU/mL, and 2.979, respectively. Of the four biomarkers, AFP and NLR showed
comparable specificity (0.881 and 0.858) and sensitivity (0.561 and 0.539). The combination of AFP and NLR showed the
highest AUC (0.769) with a significantly higher sensitivity (0.767) and a lower specificity (0.773) compared to AFP or NLR
alone, and it had the highest sum of sensitivity and specificity (1.54) among all combinations. In patients with AFP < 20
ng/mL, the NLR showed the highest AUC and combination with other markers did not improve the diagnostic
accuracy.
Conclusions: Our data indicate that the combination of AFP and NLR offers better diagnostic performance than either
marker alone for differentiating HCC from liver disease, which may benefit clinical screening.

Background
Liver cancer is the sixth most common cancer and the third
leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide [1, 2]. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which accounts for 70–85%
of liver cancer cases, is always diagnosed in an advanced
stage and is associated with a poor prognosis, with a 5-year
overall survival rate of less than 15% [3, 4]. At present,
treatments such as surgery and liver transplantation for
early-stage HCC result in better outcomes with a 5-year
overall survival rate of more than 70% [5–7]. Therefore,
diagnosis of HCC during an early stage is pivotal for improving the clinical outcomes of patients.
Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is the most widely used serum
marker for screening and initial diagnosis of HCC in clinical practice. However, the sensitivity of AFP is only about
60% at a cut-off value of 20 ng/mL, and the specificity is
low [8–10]. Moreover, AFP levels remain normal in 15–
30% of patients with advanced stage disease and increase
in some patients with chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and

other liver diseases [4, 11], leading to high negative and
false-positive rates. Therefore, novel markers that complement the limitations of AFP are needed to for screening
and more accurate diagnosis of HCC.
Crosstalk between cancer cells and their inflammatory
microenvironment plays critical roles in the initiation and
progression of cancer, including the promotion of angiogenesis, proliferation, and metastasis [12–14]. Inflammatory
infiltrates in the tumor microenvironment largely influence
the biological behavior of HCC [15–18]. The
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is one parameter
reflecting the presence of a systemic inflammatory response
and can be readily determined at low cost through routine
blood examination. The baseline NLR has been reported to
be a valuable predictor in many cancers, including colorectal
cancer [19], renal cancer [20], diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
[21, 22], and HCC [23]. The NLR also has been reported to
be diagnostic marker for peptic ulcer perforation [24], acute
mesenteric ischemia [25], and lung cancer [26, 27].
Thus, we questioned whether the NLR can be used as
a supplementary diagnostic marker with AFP. This study
aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of AFP in combination with the NLR for HCC. To better investigate
the relative diagnostic value of serum biomarkers, two
common serum biomarkers for liver function, aspartate
aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase
(ALT), also were analyzed in the present study.
Methods
Patients
Patients diagnosed with HCC and liver disease were
enrolled at the three centers (Peking University 1st Hospital, Xi’an Jiaotong University 1st Hospital and The Second Hospital of Nanjing, Affiliated to Medical School of
Southeast University) between July 2013 and July 2016.
HCC was diagnosed according to the Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver (APASL) consensus
recommendations on HCC [28]. Only newly diagnosed
and treatment-naïve patients with HCC were enrolled in
the present study. Liver disease samples were mainly
from patients infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or
hepatitis C virus (HCV) and include samples from patients with hepatitis and cirrhosis, which were diagnosed
according to APASL guideline.
This study was conducted according to the Declaration
of Helsinki and approved by the Ethics of Committee.
Data collection
Serum AST and ALT concentrations and the numbers of
neutrophils and lymphocytes were recorded from routine
clinical testing. Serum AFP was measured using the Abbott
ARCHITECT hepatitis B surface antigen chemiluminescent
microparticle immunoassay (Abbott Diagnostics, Abbott
Park, IL, USA). The NLR was calculated by dividing the
number of neutrophils by the number of lymphocytes.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (version
21; IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Data are presented as mean
± standard derivation for normally distributed continuous
data, as median (interquartile range, Q25–Q75) for abnormally distributed continuous data, or as actual values for
categorical data. Comparisons between two groups were
performed using t test, Wilcoxon test, or chi-square test.
Receiver operation characteristic (ROC) curves were used
to compare the diagnostic performance of each biomarker.
The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for each biomarker
for distinguishing HCC and liver disease patients as well
as the optimal cut-off value, sensitivity, specificity, positive
predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value
(NPV) were calculated using MedCalc. Combinations of
markers were analyzed, and the related parameters were calculated with the online statistical software OpenEpi (http://
www.openepi.com/Menu/OE_Menu.htm). A P value < 0.05
was considered to indicate a statistically significant
difference.

Results
Clinical characteristics of the participants
In total, 545 patients, 369 with HCC and 176 with liver
disease (21 cases of cirrhosis, 130 cases of hepatitis, and
25 cases of other diseases including autoimmune liver
disease and alcoholic liver disease) were included in this
study. The clinical characteristics of all participants are
shown in Table 1. While ALT levels did not differ significantly, HCC patients were older, more likely to be male,
had fewer neutrophils and lymphocytes, had a higher
NLR, and had higher AST and AFP levels than liver disease patients (all P < 0.001).
Diagnostic accuracy of serum biomarkers for detecting
HCC
The ROC curves for serum biomarkers (AFP, ALT, AST,
and NLR) for diagnosing HCC are shown in Fig. 1. The
AUC values for AFP, ALT, AST, and NLR were 0.775
(0.738–0.810), 0.504 (0.461–0.547), 0.660 (0.618–0.699),
and 0.738 (0.699–0.774) with optimal cut-off values of
24.6 ng/mL, 111 IU/mL, 27 IU/mL, and 2.979, respectively. When applying the common cutoff value of 20 ng/
mL for AFP, the AUC was 0.664 (0.6224–0.703) (Table 2).
Of the four biomarkers, ALT showed the highest specificity (0.909) with the lowest sensitivity (0.184), and AFP
and NLR individually showed both higher specificity
(0.881 and 0.858) and higher sensitivity (0.561 and
0.539) compared to AST (Table 2).
Because both AFP and NLR showed low sensitivity
values, the diagnostic value of biomarker combinations
was evaluated. The AUC, sensitivity, specificity, PPV,
and NPV as well as optimal cut-off values for each
marker and different combinations of biomarkers are
summarized in Table 3. As diagnostic biomarkers for
HCC, among all combinations of two biomarkers, the
combination of AFP and NLR showed the highest AUC
(0.769) with a significantly higher sensitivity (0.767) and
a lower specificity (0.773) compared to AFP or NLR
alone. In addition, this combination had the highest sum
of sensitivity and specificity (1.54) among all the
two-marker combinations. However, the combination of
NLR and AST was the most sensitive (0.892) with a specificity of 0.409. Among all combinations with three biomarkers, the combination of AFP, NLR, and AST was
the most sensitive (0.927) with a specificity of 0.409 and
showed the same accuracy as the combination of all four
biomarkers (Table 2). The combination of AFP, NLR,
and ALT showed the highest AUC (0.773) with the highest sum of sensitivity and specificity (1.524) among all
the three-marker combinations.

For combinations of markers, similar results were obtained when applying the common cutoff value of 20 ng/
mL AFP or the optimal cutoff value of 24.6 ng/mL AFP
(Table 4). When used in combination, AFP and NLR
showed the highest sum of sensitivity and specificity
(1.511).
Diagnostic accuracy of AFP with different cut-off value as
well as in combination with three other biomarkers
Next, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV for AFP at
different cutoff values were analyzed. As shown in Table 2,
with the increase in cutoff value, AFP showed decreased
sensitivity (from 0.577 at 20 ng/mL to 0.396 at 200 ng/mL)
and increased specificity (from 0.852 at 20 ng/mL to 0.955
at 200 ng/mL), with the highest AUC of 0.775 at 24.64 ng/
mL. Then we used the cutoff value of AFP with 95% specificity, which was 188.40 ng/mL, in combination with other
markers. If the sensitivity was as high as 90%, the cut-off
values for AST, ALT, and NLR were 26.4–26.6, 20.8, and
1.7, respectively, and the cutoff values for AST and ALT
were 29.6 IU/mL and 23.5 IU/mL.
Diagnostic accuracy of NLR in patients with low AFP (<
20 ng/mL)
In the present study, 156 (42.3%) HCC patients and 149
(85.1%) liver disease patients had an AFP level less than
20 ng/mL. We also evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of
these biomarkers for HCC in these patients. As shown
in Fig. 2 and Table 5, among all three biomarkers, the
NLR showed the highest AUC (0.685). ALT and AST
showed the same AUC and cutoff values as in the whole
population, whereas the NLR had a lower AUC (0.685 vs
0.738) and a higher cutoff value (3.355 vs 2.979) with an
increased specificity (0.926 vs 0.858) in patients with a low

AFP level. Among biomarker combinations, NLR and
ALT together showed the highest AUC (0.682) with the
highest sum of sensitivity and specificity (1.423; Table 6).
Discussion
In the present study, the diagnostic values of AFP, NLR,
AST, and ALT as well as their combinations were evaluated and compared. The data showed that AFP remained
the best single marker, and the NLR was a comparable
single marker to AFP. The combination of AFP and
NLR had the best diagnostic performance (with a sum of
sensitivity and specificity of 1.54) compared to all other
combinations, even in patients with AFP < 20 ng/mL.
Combination of three or four markers did not improve
the diagnostic performance compared to the combination of AFP and NLR. In patients with AFP < 20 ng/
mL, the NLR showed the best AUC as a single marker,
and the combination of NLR and ALT showed the best
AUC as a combination marker.
At present, early diagnosis of HCC is still a challenge.
Although AFP is a well-known and widely used clinical
marker for screening, diagnosing and monitoring HCC,
the low sensitivity restricts its clinical application [4, 10].
Researchers are looking for new efficient diagnosis
markers. microRNAs, osteopontin, glypican-3, and
Cavin-2 are several biomarkers reported to be potential
diagnostic indicators of HCC [4, 11, 29–31]. However,
these biomarkers show limited improvement or even no
improvement in HCC diagnosis compared to AFP, and
they are not competitive candidates. Several studies also
have investigated the combination of AFP with other
biomarkers such as osteopontin, Dickkopf-1(DKK-1),
protein induced by vitamin K absence (PIVKA-II) and
Lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive fraction of AFP
(AFP-L3) [10, 32]. However, the conclusions from different studies are controversial. Lim et al. found that PIVK
A-II was the most accurate diagnostic marker and diagnostic accuracy was improved by combining the AFP,
PIVKA-II, and AFP-L3 markers compared to each
marker alone for HCC diagnosis [32]. Jang et al. found
that AFP was still the most useful single biomarker and
diagnostic accuracy was improved by combining AFP
and DKK-1 but not other biomarkers [10]. Moreover,
these added biomarkers are not common clinically measured parameters. Considering the limited diagnostic accuracy improved by combination, it is not cost-effective
to introduce such new biomarkers in routine clinical detection. The diagnostic accuracy of AFP combined with
some more common and available markers from routine
examinations should be investigated.
The NLR is a simple biomarker of inflammation and
clinically available through routine examination. It has
been proposed to be of prognostic value in HCC. The
NLR can predict HCC recurrence after liver transplantation or in recurrent HCC patients following thermal
ablation [33, 34], and an elevated NLR indicates a poor
prognosis for HCC patients [23]. All these data indicate
that the NLR may reflect the disease status of the patients and may be used for screening.
In the present study, we investigated the diagnostic
values of AFP, NLR, AST, and ALT alone as well as their
combinations. Our data indicate that AFP is still the
most effective single diagnostic marker for HCC, although the NLR is comparable to AFP. The AUC for
AFP at the optimal cutoff value of 24.64 ng/mL was
0.775, which is consistent with previous reports [10, 32].

However, when applying the most common cutoff value
of AFP (20 ng/mL), the AUC was only 0.664, indicating
that in our study population, 20 ng/mL is not an optimal
cutoff value. The AUC for the NLR in the present study
was 0.738, suggesting the NLR is a promising diagnostic
marker for HCC.
Further evaluation of biomarker combinations showed
that the combination of AFP and NLR had the highest
diagnostic accuracy, and the AUC for this combination
was 0.769 with a sensitivity of 0.767 and specificity of
0.773, which showed a comparable diagnostic accuracy
to the combination of AFP and DKK-1 or AFP,
PICKA-II, and AFP-L3 as previously reported [10, 32].
Our data indicate that combination of AFP and NLR is a
promising diagnostic marker for HCC.
When we evaluated the diagnostic value of NLR in patients with AFP < 20 ng/mL, we found that compared to
AST and ALT, the NLR still showed a relative high AUC
(0.685) with a sensitivity of 0.423 and specificity of 0.926,
and the PPV was 0.857, indicating its possible application
in this population. Further analysis of combinations of biomarkers showed that addition of other biomarkers did not
improve diagnostic accuracy beyond that of NLR alone.
There are a few limitations in the present study. First,
this was a retrospective study, and thus, selection bias
could not be avoided. Second, only patients with liver
disease caused by HBV or HCV infection were enrolled
as the control group, and thus, the influencing factors
may not be complex enough to reflect the whole liver
disease population. Therefore, the conclusions should be
further confirmed. Third, we did not collect enough data
for HCC stage, and thus, the association between the
screening value of AFP and HCC stage cannot be evaluated. Fourth, due to a lack of follow-up data, the impact of
AFP/NLR on the development and progression of HCC
over time cannot be evaluated. We will evaluate the longitudinal significance of AFP/NLR in a future study.
Conclusions
In conclusion, a combination of AFP and NLR showed
better accuracy than either marker alone for differentiating HCC from liver disease. Because the NLR is a readily
measurable marker on routine examination, this study
provides further insight into their clinical applications.
