ABSTRACT
Background. ALPPS is found to increase the resectability
of primary and secondary liver malignancy at the advanced
stage. The aim of the study was to verify the surgical and
oncological outcome of ALPPS for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC).
Methods. The study cohort was based on the ALPPS
registry with patients from 31 international centers between
August 2009 and January 2018. Propensity score matched
patients receiving chemotherapy only were selected from
the SEER database as controls for the survival analysis.
Results. One hundred and two patients undergoing ALPPS
were recruited, 99 completed the second stage with median
inter-stage duration of 11 days. The median kinetic growth
rate was 23 ml/day. R0 resection was achieved in 87
(85%). Initially high rates of morbidity and mortality
decreased steadily to a 29% severe complication rate and
7% 90-day morbidity in the last 2 years. Post-hepatectomy
liver failure remained the main cause of 90-day mortality.
Multivariate analysis revealed insufficient future liver
remnant at the stage-2 operation (FLR2) to be the only risk
factor for severe complications (OR 2.91, p = 0.02). The
propensity score matching analysis showed a superior
overall survival in the ALPPS group compared to palliative
chemotherapy (median overall survival: 26.4 months vs
14 months; 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rates: 82.4%, 70.5%
and 39.6% vs 51.2%, 21.4% and 11.3%, respectively,
p\ 0.01). The survival benefit, however, was not confirmed in the subgroup analysis for patients with
insufficient FLR2 or multifocal ICC.
Conclusion. ALPPS showed high efficacy in achieving R0
resections in locally advanced ICC. To get the most
oncological benefit from this aggressive surgery, ALPPS
would be restricted to patients with single lesions and
sufficient FLR2.
Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) is the second
most common primary liver tumor and its incidence is
increasing worldwide.1–3 Liver resection (LR), mostly
major hepatectomy, is the gold standard treatment with
curative intention.4–6 For patients presenting with unresectable ICC, systemic chemotherapy remains the mainstay
palliative treatment modality without long-term survival.7,8
Five-year overall survival after liver resection has been
reported in the range 22–44%,9 whilst approximately 58%
present with tumor recurrence within 24 months.10 To
judge the resectability, sufficient future liver remnant
(FLR) is a main factor beside the possibility of vascular as
well as biliary resections and reconstructions.11–13
In order to avoid post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF),
various procedures, including two-stage hepatectomy and
portal vein ligation known as associating liver partition and
portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS), have
been performed to induce hypertrophy of the FLR. ALPPS
was first reported by Schnitzbauer et al. in 2012.14,15 This
innovative technique was rapidly adopted by hepatobiliary
centers in the management of advanced liver tumors due to its
promising high R0 resection rate.16–19 Nevertheless, some
legitimate concerns were raised due to its high morbidity and
mortality in comparison to conventional major hepatectomies.20–23 The mid- and long-term oncological outcomes of
the ALPPS procedure performed for locally advanced ICC
patients remain unverified. The potential oncological benefit
ALPPS for Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma 1373

of this aggressive surgical approach over alternative therapeutic modalities such as chemotherapy has not been
investigated to date.
AIM
The primary objective of this study was to investigate
the oncological benefit of the ALPPS procedure for locally
advanced ICC in comparison to chemotherapy. Knowing
that ALPPS is associated with high morbidity and early
mortality, identifying the risk factors as well as the subgroup of patients that might not benefit from this procedure
was the secondary objective.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Study Design
The present cohort was composed of data derived from
the International ALPPS Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov:
NCT01924741). The study was approved by the Scientific
Committee of the ALPPS Registry on June 18, 2017 (http://
www.alpps.net/?q=node/88). Other hepatobiliary centers
that were not on the registry at that time were encouraged
to register themselves. Questionnaires were sent to all
centers to complete the items required, especially perioperative outcome as well as long-term outcome of the
ALPPS procedure for ICC patients. Since patients undergoing ALPPS were those usually regarded as
unresectable and would have had palliative chemotherapy,
a group of patients receiving only palliative chemotherapy
in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) database (https://seer.cancer.gov) was chosen
as a comparison to study the oncological benefits of the
ALPPS procedure.
The study consisted of three main parts: (1) analyzing
the safety and efficacy (in terms of resectability) of ALPPS
in a multi-centric database and identifying the risk factors
for postoperative morbidity and 90-day mortality; (2)
comparing the overall survival with a propensity-score
matched group of patients who received palliative
chemotherapy from a national database; and (3) a supplementary analysis was performed to identify a subgroup of
patients who might not benefit from the ALPPS procedure.
Study Population
The registry data of ALPPS was first exported for the
latest analysis on November 11, 2017. All centers updated
the information until May 22, 2019. Patients with primary
ICC who received chemotherapy without surgical resection
were retrieved from the SEER database.
Variables Definition
For the ALPPS group, data on patient demographics,
comorbidities, reason for performing ALPPS, volumetric
data, procedure details, postoperative complications, liver
parenchyma status, tumor pathology, and follow-up with
details on recurrence and survival status were provided by
the ALPPS registry as well as by the participating centers.
For the chemotherapy group, the SEER * Stat statistical
software (version 8.3.2) was utilized to select the study
population. In this version, data of patients classified by the
7th edition of the AJCC TNM staging system were available during the period from January 2010 till December
2013. The primary site code ‘‘C22.1’’ referred to the
intrahepatic bile duct, and the ICDO-3 histology/behavior
code ‘‘8160/3’’ was for cholangiocarcinoma. The
chemotherapy data were labeled as ‘‘Yes’’ vs ‘‘No/unknown’’. Only cases labeled ‘‘Yes’’ for chemotherapy were
included in the study. The chemotherapy regimens were
not described in detail. Patients with ICC were identified
according to the International Classification of Diseases for
Oncology, 3rd edition, ICD-O-3/WHO, 2008. The codes
for patient demographics, tumor size, multifocality, vascular invasion, lymph node metastases and survival were
interpreted using the Collaborative Stage data set (http://
web2.facs.org/cstage0205/liver/Liverschema.html).
Outcome Assessment
Volumetry study was represented by FLR to standard
total liver volume24 (FLR/sTLV) ratio and FLR to body
weight (FLR/BW) ratio. The median values of FLR/BW
and FLR/sTLV after stage-1 and stage-2 hepatectomies
were utilized as cut-off values for logistic regression
analyses. To standardize kinetic growth, a mean volume
(ml and %) increase per day was calculated assuming a
linear growth model.25 Growth was expressed in FLR
increase per day in percent. Complications were identified
according to liver surgery specific clinical endpoints
(CEP).26,27 The five elements of CEP beside mortality are
PHLF, ascites, bile leak, infection and post hepatectomy
hemorrhage (PHH). Complications were graded according
to the definitions of the International Study Group of Liver
Surgery (ISGLS) and the Clavien-Dindo classification.28–31
We defined severe complications as a Clavien-Dindo grade
3b or greater, including postoperative mortality (i.e., grade
5). The histological data consisted of TNM staging
according to the 7th edition of AJCC staging system and
tumor resection margin status. The follow-up data in the
ALPPS group included the survival status, reason for death,
recurrence status, time to recurrence, or death. Time to
recurrence was defined as being from the stage-2 operation
until recurrence (hepatic or extrahepatic). Overall survival
1374 J. Li et al.

(OS) was defined as the date of the first stage operation of
ALPPS until death or last follow-up.
In the chemotherapy group the outcome included survival status and cause of death. The survival per month
variable in the SEER data is explicitly reported in numbers,
which represent the time from diagnosis to death (for
deceased patients) or last follow-up (for alive patients).
Cause of death was reported as ‘‘death due to cancer,’’
‘‘death due to other cause,’’ or ‘‘unknown.’’
Statistical Analysis
Continuous variables are expressed as median (range)
and were analyzed by the Mann–Whitney U test. Categorical-nominal variables are presented as a number
(percentage) and were analyzed by the C2 or Fisher’s exact
tests, as appropriate. All the represented percentages in the
result section have excluded the missing values.
For the ALPPS group, uni- and multivariate logistic
regression analyses were performed to verify risk factors
for severe complications including the 90-day mortality. In
order to understand the correlation between risk factors, the
phi coefficient was calculated between nominal variables
or between nominal variables and modified categorical
variables. The Kaplan–Meier method was utilized to calculate overall survival and recurrence, and the log-rank test
was used to assess the difference between curves. Cox
proportional hazard regression was performed to evaluate
risk factors associated with prognosis. Variables with
p\ 0.1 in the univariate analysis were further included in
the multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression
analysis with a stepwise forward conditional selection.
Based on the propensity score, one-to-one nearest neighbor
matching with replacement was adopted to overcome
selection bias and minimize differences between the
chemotherapy group and the ALPPS group. The propensity
scores calculated by a logistic regression model represent
the probability of each patient being assigned to each
treatment. The variables included in this model were: age,
gender, tumor stage, and lymph node status. Two-tailed
p\ 0.05 values were considered statistically significant
and all statistical calculations were performed using SPSS
version 21.0 (Chicago, IL, USA).
RESULTS
Demographics and Clinical Features
A total of 102 patients with ICC undergoing ALPPS in
31 institutes from 18 countries between August 2009 and
January 2018 were included. The median number of
patients per center was two (range, 1–12). Ten centers
performed C 5 ALPPS for ICC each.
There were 46 men and 56 women, median age 65 years
(32–84) (Table 1). The reason for performing ALPPS was
insufficient FLR for one-stage hepatectomy according to
the surgeon’s assessment. In 86.6% of patients the decision
to perform the ALPPS procedure was taken solely
according to the liver volume. Insufficient liver function
due to diseased liver parenchyma with limited liver volume32 was mentioned in 5.2% of patients. No details were
given in the other 8.2% of patients.
Based on preoperative radiological assessment, a single
lesion centrally located was reported in 72.2%. Multiple
lesions in the right lobe were reported in 18.6%. Bilobular
tumors requiring clearance of FLR was found in 8.8%.
Preoperative chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin
was carried out in 7.9% (Table 1). Preoperative biliary
drainage by means of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or percutaneous transhepatic
cholangiography (PTC) was performed in 5%.
Procedure Details
For stage-1 operations intraoperative blood transfusion
was reported in 22% of patients. Lymphadenectomy was
performed in 67.4%. Tumor resection in the FLR was
reported in 12.2%. Biliary digestive anastomosis was performed in 13.7%. Vascular reconstruction was reported in
2%. Full laparoscopic resection was performed in 6%.
Hybrid ALPPS33 was performed in 5%. The median
intensive care unit (ICU) stay after a stage-1 operation was
1 day (0–30).
In total, 99 patients underwent a stage-2 operation. The
median inter-stage duration was 11 days (3–49). The stage2 operation could not be carried out in three (2.9%)
patients. Insufficient FLR hypertrophy as well as tumor
progression were the reasons reported in two patients. The
third patient died due to postoperative hemorrhage after a
stage-1 operation.
In stage-2 operations intraoperative blood transfusion
was reported in 33.1%. Right trisectionectomy was performed in 78.7% of cases. Right hepatectomy was
performed in the remaining cases. Biliary digestive anastomosis was performed in 22%. Vascular reconstruction
was performed in 12.1%. Full laparoscopic resection was
performed in 9.6%. Lymphadenectomy was performed in
20.9%. The median ICU stay after a stage-2 operation was
1 day (0–43).
Volumetry Study Outcome
For stage-1 operations the median FLR/sTLV ratio
(FLR1/sTLV) was 22% (9–39%). The median FLR1/BW
ALPPS for Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma 1375

ratio was 0.46% (0.19–0.84%). For stage-2 operations the
median FLR/sTLV ratio (FLR2/sTLV) was 40%
(16–69%). The FLR increase was 75% (range, 3–192%).
The median FLR2/BW ratio was 0.84% (0.35–1.51%). The
median kinetic growth rate (KGR) was 7.3%/day
(0.4–24.2%) or 23 ml/day (2–70). The median KGR was
found to be higher in patients with age \ 65 years compared to patients with age C 65 years (8.7%/day vs
6.0%/day, p = 0.021). The quality of liver parenchyma was
not confirmed as a factor influencing the KGR (p = 0.426).
Postoperative Morbidity and Mortality (Table 2)
(a) After stage-1 operation:
The overall morbidity after a stage-1 operation was
25%. Liver surgery specific complications were reported as
PHLF in 10.8%, ascites in 16.7%, bile leak in 12.6%,
infection complications in 13.7%, and PHH in 26.3%.
Severe complications (Clavien-Dindo grades 3b to 5)
were reported in six patients (6.1%). Among them, three
were infection complications and the other three were
PHH. No grade C PHLF or bile leak according to the
ISGLS classification were reported. One patient died on
13th day after the stage-1 operation due to PHH.
(b) After stage-2 operation:
The overall morbidity after a stage-2 operation was
76.8%. Liver surgery specific complications were reported
as PHLF in 34.9%, ascites in 51.3%, bile leak in 30.9%,
infection complications in 43.8%, and PHH in 31.3%
(Table 2).
Severe complications (Clavien-Dindo grades 3b to 5)
were reported in 41.4% of the cases, including a 90-day
mortality of 21.2% (21 patients). The morbidity and mortality rates steadily decreased over the years (Fig. 1).
Among the severe complications, infection complication
was reported in 12.5%. Grade C PHLF, bile leak, and PHH
were reported in 12.8%, 7.2%, and 3.1%, respectively.
Therapy refractory ascites (defined as a daily ascites volume more than 1000 ml despite medical treatment after
POD 7) developed in 20.3% patients.

analysis identified FLR2/sTLV \ 40% as the only statistically significant risk factor for 90-day mortality (OR 5.52,
p = 0.01).
Histopathological Results
Among the studied population, adenocarcinoma was
reported in 93.7% of cases (Table 3). Other subtypes of
ICC were not specified. Positive lymph nodes were identified in 37.2% (n = 35). Tumor multifocality was reported
in 60%. In non-tumor liver parenchyma, fibrosis was found
in 26.2%, cirrhosis in 2.4%, and steatosis [30% in 7.1%
patients.
Based on the 7th edition of the AJCC staging system,
the disease was classified as stage I in 7.1%, stage II in
39.3%, stage III in 11.9%, and stage IVa in 41.7%. A
negative margin was achieved in 87 patients (87.9%).
Follow-Up
The median follow-up by the reverse Kaplan–Meier
method was 31.8 (17.4–46.2) months. Overall mortality
was reported in 49.5% (n = 49). The median OS was
26.4 months. The overall survival rate at 1, 2, 3, and
5 years postoperatively was 64.3%, 52.5%, 38.8% and
22.0%, respectively. At the end of follow-up, tumor
recurrence (including intra- and extrahepatic recurrence)
was reported in 53 patients (55.8%). The median recurrence time was 9.3 months (5.9–12.73). The overall
recurrence rate at 1, 2, and 3 years postoperatively was
55.1%, 74.3%, and 92%, respectively. The intrahepatic
recurrence rate at 1, 2, and 3 years postoperatively was
49.7%, 68%, and 82.9%, respectively. The extrahepatic
recurrence rate at 1, 2, and 3 years postoperatively was
29.1%, 48.2%, and 53.4%, respectively.
According to preoperative imaging, a subgroup analysis
of two groups of patients was performed: Group A with
single lesion (n = 70); Group B with multiple lesions
(n = 27). The 1-, 2-, and 3-year recurrence rates were
54.2%, 71.5%, and 91.1% in Group A and 67.8%, 100%,
and 100% in Group B, with a median recurrence time of 11
(6.6–15.5) months in Group A and 4.5 (3.1–6) months in
Group B (p = 0.03). Group B had a higher rate of extrahepatic recurrence than Group A (1-, 2-, and 3-year
recurrence rates were 51.1%, 77.7%, and 77.7% in Group
B vs 22.6%, 39.4%, and 46.1% in Group A, p = 0.01)
while the hepatic recurrence rate was similar in both
groups.
Propensity Score Matching Analysis
Data with TNM staging from the AJCC 7th edition were
only available between January 2010 and December 2013
in the SEER database. Within this time period, 453 patients
with pathological confirmation of ICC, who received
chemotherapy only, were identified.
After propensity score matching by age, gender, tumor
stage and lymph node status, 88 patients in each group
were included for further analysis. The median age was
65 years in the ALPPS group and 64 years in the
chemotherapy (CTx) group. The stage distribution of

tumors was stage I in 10.2%, stage II in 38.6%, stage III in
13.6%, and stage IVa in 37.5% (Table 4).
The 90-day mortality in the ALPPS group was higher
than in the CTx group (21.8% vs 12.9%). Despite this, a
superior OS was found in the ALPPS group with a median
OS of 26.4 (12.6–40.2) months compared to 14 (11.4–16.6)
months in the CTx group. The 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival
rates were 66.0%, 55.9%, and 40.1% in the ALPPS group
and 52.6%, 14.1%, and 11.3% in the CTx group, respectively (p\ 0.01, Fig. 2).
By multivariate COX regression survival analyses, three
statistically significant prognostic factors for poor overall
survival were identified: (1) patients receiving chemotherapy only (HR = 1.734, p = 0.012); (2) age [65 years (HR
1.561, p = 0.034); and (3) lymph node metastasis (HR
1.653, p = 0.022).
As a FLR2/BW ratio less than 0.8% was the only significant risk factor for Clavien-Dindo grade C 3b
complication in the multivariate analysis (OR 2.91,
p = 0.02), a subgroup analysis with FLR2/BW as the cutoff was analyzed. The benefit of ALPPS in regard to OS
was confirmed in the subgroup with FLR2/BW ratio
C 0.8% (p\0.001) but not in the subgroup of FLR2/
BW \0.8% (p = 0.231) compared to the CTx group
(Fig. 3).
When the study population was divided according to
preoperative imaging as Group A with a single lesion with
the tumor centrally located and Group B with multiple
lesions, the benefit of ALPPS on OS was confirmed in
Group A (p = 0.004) but not in Group B (p = 0.247) when
compared to the CTx group (Fig. 4).
DISCUSSION
Recently, ALPPS has been introduced as a novel solution that enables curative resection in marginally
resectable tumors.34 Reports of the short-term outcomes of
ALPPS in colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), perihilar cholangiocarcinoma
(CCA), but not ICC, have been published in the
past.20,23,35,36 A look into the current literature reveals that
definitive evidence showing a benefit of the ALPPS procedure in terms of survival and oncological outcome in
patients with ICC is still lacking. Additionally, there is no

large comparative study available to evaluate the risk–
benefit balance of the ALPPS procedure in comparison to
standard chemotherapy.
The results of our comparative survival analysis provide
evidence for superior long-term outcomes of the ALPPS
procedure over chemotherapy only. Despite the 90-day
mortality, ALPPS shows superior 3-year overall survival
rates compared to chemotherapy only (39.6% vs 11.3%,
p = 0.01). The benefit of overall survival at 2 years was
even greater, with a difference of 41.8% between the two
groups (Fig. 2). Therefore, we believe that extensive liver

resection by ALPPS procedure could provide better outcomes for patients with locally advanced ICC lesions, who
are usually directed toward palliative chemotherapy. Longterm survival in this group of patients has also been
achieved: the first ALPPS patient at the University
Hospital Mainz celebrated her 10-year survival in August
2019. Except for an early intrahepatic recurrence during
the 1st postoperative year, which was treated by repeated
liver resection, the patient is now still disease free.
High morbidity and mortality rates after stage-2 operations were observed in patients with ICC, comparable with
morbidity and mortality rates following ALPPS for other
primary liver malignancies, such as HCC or perihilar
CCA.20,23 The high complexity of surgery in this group of
patients may be one of the main reasons for this observation. Indeed, trisectionectomy was performed in 78.7% of
cases, biliary reconstruction in 35.6% and complex vascular reconstruction in 12.1%. Liver surgery specific
complications were reported as PHLF in 30.3%, ascites in
49.3%, bile leak in 30.3%, infection complications in 42%,
and PHH in 35.3%. Interestingly, when analyzing the risk
factors for developing severe complications, lower future
liver remnant volume at the stage-2 operation (FLR2),
represented either by FLR2/BW \0.8% or FLR2/
sTLV \ 40%, was the only statistically significant factor in
the multivariate analysis. Moreover, FLR2/BW \0.8% or
FLR2/sTLV \40%, was found to be correlated with PHLF
(p\0.01). Till now there has been no recommendation for
defining the threshold FLR volume heading into a stage-2
operation in ALPPS. A FLR/BW C 0.5% in a non-cirrhotic liver is usually deemed as safe in one-stage
hepatectomy.37 The cut-off of FLR/BW for a safe liver
resection was indicated to be 0.8% in this study, much
more liver volume than 0.5% in one-stage hepatectomy. It
further supported the conclusion that liver volume does not
necessarily equal liver function in the setting of ALPPS.38
Recently, 99mTc-mebrofenin hepatobiliary scintigraphy
has been reported to be a valuable technique to estimate the
risk of PHLF.39,40 In ALPPS, a liver function test has been
applied in several institutes to ensure a safe outcome.41
However, a clear cut-off is still not available. Moreover,
the liver function test by 99mTc-mebrofenin hepatobiliary
scintigraphy was not routinely performed at the majority of
centers at the time of the current study. Based on the data
on liver volume, the current study demonstrated that FLR2/
BW \0.8% or FLR2/sTLV \ 40% was a risk factor for
PHLF and severe complications. Thus, a threshold of
FLR2/BW as 0.8% or FLR2/sTLV as 40% is recommended
in ICC patients waiting for stage-2 operation whenever
liver function tests are not available.
The 90-day mortality of 20.8% in our study is undisputedly high in comparison with mortality rates for
conventional major hepatectomies or ALPPS performed for
non-primary hepatobiliary malignancies.18,21,42 We would
like to emphasize that the reported results of early mortality in our cohort represent both initial and recent
experiences. In 2017 and 2018, the 90-day mortality was
7% (1/14), which had dropped significantly from 40%
before 2012. We therefore conclude that the learning curve
and improved patient selection will eventually lead to
acceptable mortality rates.
The high rate of severe postoperative complications also
had a significant impact on the survival benefit of the
ALPPS procedure over chemotherapy only. Among the
propensity score-match (PSM) analysis, the 90-day mortality in the ALPPS group was higher than in the CTx
group (21.6% vs 12.5%). Despite this, a superior overall
survival was found in the ALPPS group with a median
survival time of 26.4 months compared to 14 months in the
CTx group. Therefore, minimizing severe postoperative
complications, especially the 90-day mortality, was among
the most important tasks of ALPPS development. During
recent years, major focus has been put on the surgical
refinement of stage1 operations.42 A variety of methods for
liver partition have been proposed.17,43–45 Accordingly,
postoperative morbidity and mortality rates have been
reduced.42 However, the importance of sufficient FLR at
stage-2 has not been previously emphasized. In the current
study, we found that a small FLR at stage-2 was the only
statistically significant risk factor regarding 90-day mortality. In PSM analysis, the benefit of ALPPS on overall
survival was confirmed in the subgroup with FLR2/BW
ratio C 0.8% (p = 0.001) but not in the subgroup of FLR2/
BW \0.8% (p = 0.294) in comparison to the chemotherapy only group. Indeed, achieving complete tumor
resection (R0 in 87.9%) in this study arguably led to higher
postoperative morbidity and mortality rates. Decision
making for the timing of stage-2 operations remains a
major challenge, especially when quantitative liver function tests are not available. Caution should be taken when
the FLR/BW ratio prior to stage-2 operation is below 0.8%.
This may well be the most important lesson learned over
the course of this study.
The risk for high postoperative morbidity and mortality
rates in the ALPPS procedure with R0 resection should be
weighed against alternative approaches. Until now, portal
vein embolization (PVE) has been the mainstay for
inducing FLR hypertrophy preoperatively in many institutions, whereas the superiority of ALPPS to PVE has been
demonstrated in patients with CRLM.36 In the majority of
cases in this cohort, PVE would have been technically very
demanding or even impossible due to the tumor mass and
location. A propensity score-match to compare ALPPS
with PVE in this group of patients was unfortunately not
feasible due to the small numbers in both groups. However,
the choice of either ALPPS or PVE in the treatment of ICC
ALPPS for Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma 1381

needs to be investigated. Furthermore, the role of neoadjuvent chemotherapy with or without PVE in selected
patients should be studied. Locoregional treatment strategies for advanced ICC include transarterial
chemoembolization, yttrium-labeled selective internal
radiation therapy, and hepatic arterial infusion.46,47 Despite
promising results reported, the conclusive evidence for
efficacy of these strategies is still lacking.1,8
In a large multi-institutional series of 301 patients with
ICC, more than half of the patients experienced recurrence
after resection.48 The majority of patients in that cohort had
T1 category tumors (58.1%). In the current cohort the
patients suffered from more advanced tumor disease, with
53.4% showing AJCC stage III or IVa (T1 tumors were
found only in 14%; 60.2% patients had multiple lesions;
lymph nodes metastases were found in 40.7%). The
advanced tumor stage led to a high tumor recurrence rate of
65.6% with a median recurrence time of 8 months. Intrahepatic recurrence was observed more frequently than
extrahepatic recurrence. Patients with multiple lesions
developed intrahepatic tumor recurrence earlier (4.5 vs
9 months in median) as well as more extrahepatic recurrence when compared to patients with a single lesion
(52.2% vs 23%). In a recent meta-analysis of 4756 patients,
ICC with multiple lesions was confirmed as one of the most
important factors predicting shorter overall survival.6 In the
current study with PSM analysis, the benefit of ALPPS on
overall survival was only confirmed in patients with single
lesion, not in patients with multiple lesions, in comparison
to systemic chemotherapy. Therefore, because of high
postoperative morbidity and mortality rates as well as the
limited benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy,8 extensive liver
resection using ALPPS could not be recommended as a
better option than chemotherapy for ICC patients with
multiple lesions. Since multiple lesions could represent
systemic hematogenous metastatic intrahepatic dissemination or true multifocal disease, the prognostic relevance of
them might be different. The former is definitely not an
appropriate resection candidate.
The main limitation of this study is the retrospective
methodology that leads to selection bias in both groups,
especially that caused by under-reported cases with poor
outcomes in patients undergoing ALPPS. The difference in
experience of total cases of ALPPS per center as well as
number of ICC patients might also have an influence on
outcomes. Nevertheless, the use of propensity score matched analysis along with multivariate COX proportional
hazard modeling has strengthened the degree of evidence
and reduces this bias, and is more robustly precise than
standard multivariable methods. The classifications used
for the propensity score matching are pT and pN for the
ALPPS group vs cT and cN for the chemotherapy-only
group. This may underestimate the tumor stage in
chemotherapy-only patients and lead to a negative selection bias. Moreover, comorbidity as well as Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status was not
included in the propensity score matching, which may lead
to an overestimation of the overall survival in the ALPPS
group. A randomized control trial to investigate short- and
long-term outcomes would provide more reliable results.
We have utilized the AJCC staging system, 7th edition,
in our analysis that was in line with the staging system
utilized in both the ALPPS and SEER databases. Recently,
the AJCC has released a new staging system for ICC in its
8th edition. Nevertheless, the 8th edition staging system for
ICC has not shown a significant advantage over the 7th
edition in overall prognostic discrimination except for
stage III, which represent only 8.7% of patients included in
this study.49
From another aspect, a major advantage of this study
was utilizing the ALPPS registry database as a baseline to
create an international ALPPS prospective cohort with a
longitudinal study design by retrieving new data on the
ALPPS approach not reported by the registry web site. This
advantage will facilitate the establishment of further studies to investigate long-term oncological outcomes of the
ALPPS procedure and allow for risk adjustment analyses.
Further work is needed to achieve significant improvements in regard to the quality of the data available for
patients undergoing ALPPS. Therefore, we urge all surgeons performing this procedure to share their experiences
and data through registration in the ALPPS registry (ww
w.alpps.net).
In conclusion, this multicentric study demonstrated a
high resectability of 97% and R0 resection of 85.3% in 102
patients with initially ‘‘unresectable’’ locally advanced ICC
by ALPPS. Superior 1-, 2-, and 3-year overall survival
rates were found in the ALPPS group compared with the
chemotherapy only group, despite high 90-day mortality
rates. Better patient selection and improved interstage
decision making over time contributed to the decrease in
mortality with time. PHLF was observed in 35% of the
patients, with 12.8% classified as grade C. A threshold of
FLR/BW of 0.8% (or 40% if FLR/sTLV is used) is recommended in patients waiting for the stage-2 operation
whenever liver function tests are not available. The benefit
of ALPPS on overall survival was confirmed in ICC
patients with a centrally located single lesion, but not for
patients with multiple lesions when compared to
chemotherapy only.
