Human monocyte-derived cells with individual
hepatocyte characteristics: a novel tool for
personalized in vitro studies
Andreas Benesic, Nora L Rahm, Samuel Ernst and Alexander L Gerbes
Gender, ethnicity and individual differences in hepatic metabolism have major impact on individual drug response,
adverse events and attrition rate during drug development. Therefore, there is an urgent need for reliable test
systems based on human cells. Yet, the use of primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) is restricted by limited availability,
invasive preparation and short-term stability in culture. All other cellular approaches proposed so far have major
disadvantages. We investigated whether peripheral human monocytes after cultivation according to our novel protocol
(monocyte-derived hepatocyte-like cells (MH cells)) can serve as an in vitro model for hepatocyte metabolism. Enzyme
activities, synthesis parameters (coagulation factor VII and urea) and cytochrome (CY) P450 activities and induction were
investigated. Furthermore, MH cells were compared with PHH from the same donor. Using our protocol, we could
generate cells that exhibit hepatocyte-like properties: These cells show 71±9% of specific ALT activity, 41±3%
of CYP3A4 activity and 65±13% of factor VII secretion when compared with PHHs. Consequently, CYP-mediated
acetaminophen toxicity and drug interactions could be shown. Moreover, the investigated parameters were stable in
culture over at least 4 weeks. Furthermore, MH cells retain gender-specific and donor-specific CYP activities and toxicity
profiles, respectively. MH cells show quantitative and qualitative approximation to human hepatocytes concerning
CYP-metabolism and toxicity. Our data support individual prediction of toxicity and CYP metabolism. MH cells are a novel
tool to investigate long-term hepatic toxicity, metabolism and drug interactions.

The liver is an important site of drug metabolism and
hepatocytes are mainly responsible for toxification and
detoxification of substances. A huge array of enzymes
and transporters allows the hepatocyte to metabolize, conjugate
and finally excrete xenobiotics and endobiotics. The first step,
also referred to as phase-I metabolism, is performed predominantly by enzymes of the cytochrome P450 (CYP450)
enzyme family. The CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4 and
3A5 are found in hepatocytes with great abundance.1 Most
CYP enzymes can be induced, that is, their activity in the
hepatocyte is increased to manage greater amounts of xenobiotics. This induction is mediated by receptors, such as the
pregnane-X-receptor (PXR),2 the aryl-hydrocarbon receptor3
and the constitutive androestendione receptor.1 Knowing the
way a substance is metabolized and how a substance interacts
with co-medication is crucial for modern drug design.
Therefore, hepatocyte models are urgently needed for drug
development, because no other cell possesses a comparable
equipment of metabolism pathways. The complexity of this
system is augmented by different activities of CYP enzymes
dependent on sex, age, ethnicity and individual factors,
including co-medication.4–7 Pharmacogenomics is a powerful
tool to identify different individual metabolism patterns,8 yet
this method only detects genetic polymorphisms, which not
always predict the actual function of the enzyme.9,10 On the
search for a valid in vitro hepatocyte model, several different
cell types have been investigated.
Obviously, the use of primary hepatocytes as an in vitro
model should be the golden standard for metabolism and toxicity
studies in vitro. On the first glance, primary hepatocytes

possess all the required activities and short-term studies can
be performed with valid results.11,12 Yet, primary hepatocytes
dedifferentiate in culture dependent on the used culture
conditions (plated monolayer, sandwich culture and suspension culture). This dedifferentiation process results in a
loss in CYP450 activities and inducibility within few days.13
Using co-cultures and 3D-models, dedifferentiation can be
slowed, yet these improvements do not enable experiments
over 28 days as required by regulatory authorities. This
precludes the use of primary hepatocytes for long-term
experiments. Another drawback of primary hepatocytes is their
low abundance and the invasive way of preparation (liver
biopsy, partial liver resection, hepatocytes from cadaveric
livers). Ethical concerns preclude the gain of primary human
hepatocytes (PHHs) in many countries. On this basis, human
hepatocytes can be acquired in a sufficient amount for
in vitro experiments, but because of the mentioned restrictions, it is very difficult to investigate gender, ethnic or
individual differences using primary hepatocytes. In order to
screen a substance, the use of hepatocytes from animals can
be an alternative, but species differences in dose–effect relation can be of significant relevance.
In order to overcome the problems with primary hepatocytes, different technologies using stem cells were developed
in the recent years. Promising results with respect to hepatocyte characteristics could be obtained using the differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ES cells) into hepatocytes.
However, the ethics of using ES cells are controversially
discussed and there are major restrictions on ES cell research
in many countries. There is evidence for bone marrow stem
cells, mesenchymal stem cells or inducible pluripotent stem
cells to be a potential in vitro or even in vivo replacement for
primary hepatocytes. Yet, the generation of these cells takes
about 4–6 weeks, the yield is rather low and functional
hepatocyte characteristics are inconsistent. None of these
models has been established as an alternative for hepatocytes
in vitro and because of the low yields and long generation
times the process of validation will be cumbersome.
Another way to use cells with high yields and hepatocytecharacteristics is the use of immortalized hepatoma cells,
which retain hepatocyte function despite malignant
dedifferentiation. Cell lines such as HepG2, Hep3B and Huh-7
are well established, but they lack several hepatocyte functions. HepG2 cells, for example, exhibit functional CYP450
enzymes, yet their function strongly depends on source and
culture conditions14 and they lack a functional urea-cycle.15
Other hepatoma cell lines that have been proposed as better
models for in vitro hepatocyte research include Fa2N-4, HC04 and HepaRG cells, which show active and inducible
CYP450 metabolism and similar toxicity profiles as human
hepatocytes. An important drawback of these tumor cell
models is the origin from only one donor and the difficulty
to predict stable functions.14
A very innovative way to generate hepatocyte-like mouse
cells was shown in the work of Sekiya and Suzukai16 as well as
Huang et al.
17 These groups could show that the genetic
induction of special combinations of transcription factors
can convert mouse fibroblasts to hepatocyte-like phenotype.
In the last years, there were reports that human peripheral
blood mononuclear cells or monocytes can acquire hepatocyte characteristics without genetic modifications under
certain conditions. For example, it has been shown that
peripheral monocytes from hepatitis B-infected individuals
can engraft into mouse liver and express different hepatocyte
typic molecules, such as albumin.18 Another work showed
that monocytes are capable to attenuate liver damage by
acetaminophen (APAP) in a mouse model.19 Plasticity of
monocytic cells and the possibility to transdifferentiate across
lineage barriers, as shown for lymphocytes,20 has been proposed. Prior work showed first evidence for acquisition of
hepatocyte-like properties in monocytes,21 yet the protocol
was afflicted with problems.22 The use of autologous donor
sera seems to alleviate the standardization problems with this
model to some degree, yet the use of serum makes cells
susceptible for variations caused by different batches of
serum.23
Thus, the generation of cells with hepatocyte characteristics from monocytes could be a promising alternative
solution of the problems, which the current in vitro models
are afflicted with: short-lived enzyme activities, missing
possibilities for individualization, difficult or cumbersome
generation and low abundance of material.
We here present the features of our in vitro hepatocyte
model from human peripheral monocytes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Culture
Monocyte isolation and culture
Human peripheral monocytes were acquired from healthy
donors after informed consent. Blood was collected and cell
processing started immediately. Monocytes were isolated
after centrifugation of whole blood over a Ficoll gradient.
Afterward the interphase was collected, washed three times
with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and cells were
plated in the appropriate culture vessels. Cells were cultured
at 37 1C and 5% CO2 in a standard incubator. Serum-free
incubation medium was composed according to the standard
operating procedure reported in our patent application (EPA
#10172639.6 and PTC/EP2011/063871). Cells were cultured
in medium 1 (DMEM/HAM-F12 containing 2% human
albumin, 100 IE/100 mg penicillin/streptomycin, 1 ng/ml
recombinant human interleukin-3, 0.5 ng/ml recombinant
human macrophage colony-stimulating factor, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 nM adenosine, 10 mM deoxycholate and 50 mM
caffeine) for 5 days and in medium 2 (DMEM/HAM-F12
containing 2% human albumin, 100 IE/100 mg penicillin/
streptomycin, 3 ng/ml recombinant human fibroblast growth
factor-4, 2 mM L-glutamine, 5 IE/ml unfractionated heparin,
0.28 mU/ml recombinant human insulin, 5 nmol/l recombinant human glucagon, 10 ng/ml recombinant human epidermal

growth factor, 10 mM deoxycholate and 10 mM caffeine) for
the following culture period up to a total of 42 days (from
isolation). Experiments were conducted at the end of the
generation process at day 10 or later after isolation. Typically,
cells were used for experiments 14 days after isolation (day 0)
up to 28 days in culture.
Cryoconservation was performed using DMEM/HAM-F12
medium containing 20% DMSO, L-glutamine 2 mM, penicillin/streptomycin and 2% human serum albumin and
sterile PBS containing 1% human serum albumin in a 1:1
mixture. Cells were stored at 80 1C for 14 days.
Patient monocytes were obtained according to the guidelines of the charitable state controlled foundation HTCR
(Human Tissue and Cell Research, www.htcr.de; see also next
paragraph).
PHH isolation and culture
PHHs were obtained from the foundation human tissue and
cell research (www.htcr.de). Tissue samples and annotated
data were obtained and experimental procedures were performed within the framework of the non-profit foundation
HTCR, including the informed patient’s consent.24 Three
patients donated blood samples for monocyte preparation
before partial liver resection. Hepatocytes were cultured as
described elsewhere25 and were used for experiments at day 4
after isolation. Before stimulation or induction experiments,
cells were starved in medium without additives to exclude
possible interactions of medium components and chemicals.

determined using P450-GloTM Assay (Promega) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cells were induced
for various periods with known CYP-inducers in media
without additives.28 Luminescence values were normalized
for protein content.
Factor VII-ELISA
For analysis of secreted factor VII, a direct ELISA was performed as described in Supplementary Material.
Western Blotting
Protein expression of CYP2E1, 2C9 and 3A4 in cell lysates
and factor VII in supernatants was determined by western
blotting. Detailed information is provided in the Supplementary Files.

instruction. After synthesis of biotinylated c-RNA and
hybridization according to the manufacturer’s instructions,
expression levels of genes were analyzed by X-ray detection
and analysis of array signal using TIGR spotfinder software.
Gene expression was expressed as log2 normalized to betaactin.
Statistics
The data are presented as mean values±s.d. Significance of
differences was tested by the paired or unpaired Student’s
t-test or ANOVA as appropriate (SPSS Software version
15.0). Differences were considered significant at Po0.05.
N represents the number of donors. Measurements from cells
of a single donor were performed as triplicates or quadruplicates.
RESULTS
Cell Characteristics and Yield
During culture of monocytes using our protocol there is a
marked increase in cell size and at day 14 cells show an
epitheloid growth pattern (microscope images are provided
in the Supplementary Files). FACS analysis after the isolation
process reveals 64±15% CD14-positive cells with a small
percentage (CD3-positive cells 8±6%) of contaminating
lymphocytes. In all, 88±8% of the cells were CD45-positive
(n ¼ 10 donors). During culture, there is a moderate increase
in cell number (2.3±0.3-fold; Po0.05, n ¼ 4), this is paralleled by a marked increase in cellular protein (8.8±1.7-fold,
Po0.05, n ¼ 12) and RNA-content (4.4±1.7-fold, Po0.05,
n ¼ 3) most probably due to hypertrophy. Using FACS analysis, cells at day 14 stained positive for CYP2E1 and 3A4
(data not shown).
At day 14, cells show activities of various hepatocyte
characteristic enzymes such as DPP IV, LDH, gamma-GT and
the liver-specific ALT. Compared with PHHs these enzymes
reach specific activities of 78±19% (DPP IV), 94±11%
(gamma-GT), 71±12% (ALT) and 73±28% (LDH) in cells
of monocytic origin (n ¼ 8 for MH cells and n ¼ 3 for PHH,
see also Supplementary Material).
MH Cells Display CYP450 Activity and Induction
In order to measure CYP450 activities in MH cells, we used
luminescence based assays for CYP450 1A2, 2C9 and 3A4.28
MH cells exhibit activities of the CYP450 enzymes 3A4,
2C9 and 1A2. CYP3A4 shows highest luminescence values,
followed by 1A2 and 2C9 (Figure 1a). This activity pattern is
comparable to the situation in the liver.
To investigate induction of CYP enzymes cells were incubated with the inducers rifampicin and 3-methylcholanthrene (3MC). This led to a significant increase in CYP
activities (Figure 1a). Protein content, as a crude marker for
cell viability was not reduced by treatment with rifampicin
(124±12% of control) or 3MC (118±15% of control).
As CYP-induction is dose dependent, we tested different
concentrations of the CYP 1A2-inducer 3MC on CYP1A2
and rifampicin on CYP3A4 activity. The results shown in
Figures 1b and c provide evidence for a dose-dependent CYPinduction in MH cells.
To test CYP-induction via different pathways rifampicin,
phenytoin, carbamazepin, artemisin1 and 6-(4-chlorophenyl)-
imidazo[2,1-b][1,3]-thiazole-5-carbaldehyde O-(3,4-dichlorobenzyl)oxime (CITCO)29 and dexamethasone1 were used.
The results are shown in Figure 1d: all tested substances
affected an increase in CYP3A4 activity. None of these substances caused relevant toxicity during the 48-h incubation
period or had significant influence on protein content
(phenytoin 5 mM: 102±21%; phenytoin: 91±8%, carbamazepin: 99±22%, CITCO: 111±9%, artemisin: 88±25% and
dexamethasone: 86±8% of control).
In order to support the results obtained with CYP function, CYP enzymes and their induction were investigated by
western blotting using specific antibodies for CYP 2E1, 3A4
and 2C9. The presence of these enzymes is confirmed by
specific western blot bands. Furthermore, there is also an
increase in CYP-protein after pre-treatment of the cells with
inducers (ethanol for 2E1, rifampicin for 2C9 and 3A4;
Figure 1e).
MH Cells are Susceptible to Hepatotoxic Drugs and Drug
Interactions
As toxification of substances is a major problem in drug
development, we investigated, whether MH cells are able to
toxify APAP, an analgesic drug that is known to be converted
to toxic N-acetyl-pbenzoquinone-imine in the liver by CYP
2E1.30 APAP exposure led to a time and dose-dependent
increase in LDH-release (Figure 2a), suggesting cytochromemediated generation of toxic metabolites. By measurement of
free thiols, we found in parallel to the mechanism described
in hepatocytes a decrease in thiols in MH cell after APAP
exposure (Figure 2b).
Diclofenac is a hepatotoxic analgesic that causes liver
damage through direct toxicity, toxicity of metabolites and
allergic reaction.31,32 Figure 2c shows time and dose
dependency of diclofenac toxicty in MH cells.
As MH cells are susceptible to toxicity induced by APAP
and diclofenac, respectively, interactions of these drugs with
inducers of CYP enzymes were assessed. CYP2E1 has a role in
alcohol metabolism and progression of hepatic fibrosis.33 To
test CYP2E1 involvement in the toxicity of APAP in MH cells,
cells were pre-treated 48 h with ethanol to increase CYP2E1
content.34 The results shown in Figure 2d indicate that
ethanol pre-treatment increases APAP toxicity. This finding is
in parallel to clinically relevant aggravation of APAP-induced
liver damage by ethanol consumption.
N-acetyl-cysteine is used as an antidote for APAP
poisoning and has been shown to be protective in vivo and
in vitro. As in the clinical setting, N-acetyl-cysteine
co-administration prevented APAP toxicity in MH cells
(Figure 2e).

As metabolism of diclofenac by CYP2C9, 2C19 and 3A4
can enhance toxicity by formation of toxic metabolites, we
investigated diclofenac toxicity after CYP induction using
48 h pre-incubation with rifampicin. CYP induction using
48 h pre-incubation with 100 mM rifampicin led to an
increase in diclofenac toxicity, depicted in Figure 2f.
MH Cells Show Hepatocyte Characteristic Synthesis
An important function of hepatocytes is the detoxification
of ammonia to urea, therefore we investigated urea secretion
of MH cells. Basal urea secretion was increased after
incubation with different ammonium chloride concentrations (Figure 3a). These data provide evidence for a functional ammonia detoxification by hepatocyte-like cells of
monocytic origin.
Another fundamental characteristic of hepatocytes is the
ability to synthesize coagulation factors. As synthesis
coagulation factor VII in the liver is vitamin K dependent, we
tested whether MH cells secrete factor VII into the supernatant and the dependence on vitamin K. After incubation
with different concentrations of menadione, specific western
blot bands in cell culture supernatant and ELISA-signals
revealed a menadione-dependent secretion of factor VII
(Figures 3b and c).

MH Cells Exhibit Stable Hepatocyte Characteristics Over
28 Days
To investigate superiority of the cell model presented in the
article, we investigated the stability of the hepatocyte-like functions.
Toxicity and CYP activities and induction were of special interest.
CYP3A4 activity over time in culture, CYP induction and APAP
toxicity are summarized in Table 1. There is only a slight loss in
basal activity during a culture period of 4 weeks. Furthermore,
CYP inducibility seems also to be stable over 4 weeks in culture.
Moreover, toxicity of APAP is stable over 28 days in culture.
MH Cells Characteristics Show Approximation to PHHs
In order to investigate hepatocyte characteristics
quantitatively, enzyme activities, CYP activities and
inducibility as well as synthesis of urea and factor VII
were analyzed in comparison with PHHs. By western
blotting, we found 47.2±4.4% of CYP3A4 content in
lysates of MH cells compared with PHHs. CYP 2E1
was found with an even higher expression of 58.2±10%
of primary hepatocytes (Supplementary Material).
Analysis of cell culture supernatant revealed 54.7±
13.6% of PHH factor VII secretion (Table 2; n ¼ 3).
Furthermore, we compared the functional characteristics of PHHs from three individual donors who
underwent liver resection and donated hepatocytes.
MH cells derived from peripheral monocytes show
remarkable approximation to PHHs from the same donor
(Table 2).

MH Cells Reflect Gender Differences in Toxicity and CYP
Activity
Gender differences in hepatic metabolism are subject of
intensive investigations and their importance is underlined
by the fact that women suffer twice as often from druginduced liver injury compared with men. In order to evaluate whether monocyte-derived cells could prove useful for
individualized toxicity testing, we incubated cells of female
and male donors with APAP and diclofenac. As shown in
Figure 4a, there is no difference in APAP toxicity between
cells derived from female and male donors. Yet, there is a
significant greater toxicity of diclofenac (which is predominantly metabolized by 3A4) in cells derived from
female subjects. This finding is paralleled by a significantly
higher activity of 3A4 in cells derived from female donors,
as shown in Figure 4b.
MH Cells can be Cryoconserved
In order to establish a cell bank from different donors,
cryoconservation of the cells is required. Comparison of fresh
and cryoconserved MH cells revealed an increase in LDH
release after 24-h exposure to 20 mM APAP of 21.6±9.0% in
fresh vs 25.0±9.2% in cryoconserved MH cells (n ¼ 5,
P ¼ 0.39). Moreover, 24-h challenge with 1 mM diclofenac
induced a rise in LDH release to 58.2±9.8% in fresh and
50.3±9.6% in cryoconserved cells, respectively, (n ¼ 5;
P ¼ 0.24). Thus, cryopreservation of MH cells seems possible
without loss of important features.
MH Cells Reflect Individual Differences in CYP Activity
and Expression
As there seem to be gender differences in toxicity and CYP
activities of MH cells, we investigated individual CYP activities and their inducibility in hepatocytes and cells of
monocytic origin derived from the same donor. As shown in
Table 3, basal activities and the induction of CYP3A4 and

2C9 in primary hepatocytes seem to be reflected by MH cells
derived from the same donor.
To investigate this more in detail, we used c-RNA microarrays to analyze gene expression profiles in MH cells and
PHHs from the same donor. Comparing expression of
transcription factors, a close correlation between MH cells
and the corresponding PHH was observed in all three donors
(Figure 5a). Expression of CYP-RNA was of special interest
and data are shown in Figures 5b and c. The mRNA levels of
important CYP450 enzymes seem to correlate between MH
cells and PHHs, supporting the presented functional data.
Thus, there is evidence for reflection of individual hepatic
CYP450 equipment by MH cells.
DISCUSSION
The aim of this study was to investigate the potential usefulness of hepatocyte-like cells of peripheral monocytic origin
as a tool for in vitro research. There is urgent need for a valid,
stable and predictive tool for liver-specific toxification
and detoxification processes as well as CYP450 metabolism.
Primary hepatocytes can be of use, but these cells dedifferentiate
in culture.12 Therefore, primary hepatocytes are not suited
for long-term experiments. Other models have been proposed which make use of immortal human hepatoma cell
lines that retain to some extent hepatocyte-specific function,
especially CYP450 enzyme activities and their inducibility.
Yet, tumor cell lines are derived from only one ‘donor’ and
most probably do not reflect the situation in the population
properly. Moreover, hepatoma cell lines are not cultivated
under stringent conditions and therefore research data may
vary between laboratories.13 To overcome these problems,
stem cells hold great promise, but the generation of hepatocytes from stem cells is burdened by ethical problems as

well as the difficult, time consuming and expensive generation process. Another innovative approach is the direct
conversion of fibroblasts to hepatocyte-like cells by genetic
modifications.16,17 Yet, this procedure has until now not been
established for human tissue and possible interferences of the
genetic modifications with individual cell functions are not
predictable.
As a possible solution we propose MH cells. MH cells can
be generated from peripheral monocytes efficiently in a
period of 10 days and show several specific enzyme activities
that are also present in PHHs. These enzyme activities are
found with low variability and high reproducibility, suggesting a robust generation protocol. Furthermore, MH cells
show urea secretion dependent on ammonium chloride
exposure and menadione-dependent secretion of coagulation
factor VII. Thus, there seem to be several hepatocyte-like
features in this cell model. MH cells possess inducible
CYP450 enzymes and their CYP functions are preserved for
at least 4 weeks in culture.
Using luminescent assays, we could show that there are
relevant activities of the CYP enzymes 1A2, 2C9 and 3A4 in
MH cells, which are inducible as in PHHs. Moreover, protein
expression of CYP 3A4 and 2E1 was confirmed by western
blotting showing 50–60% of CYP3A4 and 2E1 protein
expression in MH cells compared with PHHs. As this is the
first article that describes the properties of MH cells and the
luminescent technique is only applicable for selected CYP
enzymes not all of the important members of the CYP450
family were investigated. More data are needed for CYP2C19,
2A6 and 2B6. Studies employing metabolite analyses to
measure activities of the other important CYP enzymes are
under way. CYP2C19 is of special interest, because it is
inducible and genetic polymorphisms of this enzyme are
well characterized. One of the next steps will be the analysis
of S-mephenytoin metabolism and its induction in donors
with known 2C19 genotype. Our data support hepatocytelike functional CYP induction in MH cells by ligands of the
PXR, of the aryl-hydrocarbon receptor, of the glucocorticoid
receptor and of the constitutive androstendione receptor.
The latter is lacking in some hepatoma cell models,21 but
its presence is crucial for the predictive value of induction
studies. Evidence for the presence of nuclear orphan
receptors is also supported by the microarray data, a more
detailed study of nuclear orphan receptors in MH cells is
planned.
Furthermore, MH cells exhibit toxicity of APAP, which has
to be metabolized by CYP 2E1 to exert toxic effects. In MH
cells, APAP induces depletion of thiol groups as a surrogate
marker for oxidative stress, which is in accordance with the
pathophysiology of APAP hepatotoxicity. These data highlight the capacity of the cells for metabolic activation of drugs
via the CYP450 enzyme system. Our data show the clinically
important interaction of ethanol and APAP, a prime example
for modulation of drug toxicity. MH cells prove to be a
model for this dangerous interaction.
Moreover, long-term stability could make MH cells a
unique model to investigate individual metabolic capacities
and perhaps even a tool for metabolic phenotyping, for
example, a diagnostic marker to prevent drug toxicity. As
there are no data available on another in vitro model that
maintains hepatocyte functions for 42 weeks without
complicated culture methods, this unrivalled feature of MH
cells could enable replacement of animal testing for longterm hepatic toxicity and drug interactions.
Interestingly, MH cells seem to reflect gender characteristics of their donors. We found that there are gender-specific
differences in CYP450 enzyme activities, which translate
into different in vitro toxicities, as shown for diclofenac.
Moreover, the CYP metabolism of these cells allows
experimental set-ups that can uncover potentially
dangerous drug interactions in the preclinical development
as we could show for the prime example of ethanol and
APAP and the interaction of rifampicin and diclofenac.
The enhanced toxicity of APAP after prior exposure to
ethanol is a clinical setting that is reflected by the MH cells,
underlining the possibilities of this model. MH cells can be
cryoconserved and this enables the establishment of a
cell bank, which can be used together with clinical data
to screen substances for toxicity and metabolism in silico
in a ‘population’ of donors. Thus, hepatocyte-like MH
cells could be an enabling tool in drug discovery and
development.
In a small group of patients, we found that monocytederived cells reflect donor-specific CYP activities and
induction. Similar results were found by analysis of gene
expression pattern focusing on genes involved in metabolism
and toxicity. Thus, it is conceivable, that cells from an

The activities of PHH are reflected by the corresponding MH cells, suggesting
the possibility to predict individual CYP activities using MH cells.

individual patient could be applied in clinical medicine to
screen in advance a potentially toxic drug regimen for a given
patient. Most interesting, the best correlations were found in
expression of transcription factors. This could point toward
an induction of hepatocyte gene expression in monocytes by
the applied culture protocol. Yet, this has to be validated
further.
In summary, we introduce a new model for in vitro toxicology and CYP metabolism research, which has several
advantages: the system is stable and reproducible and provides a good approximation to PHHs. In contrast to stem cell
approaches, cell yield is high and the generation process is
cost effective and quick. The cells can be cryoconserved to
enable the establishment of a cell bank and the further
research on cells from a specific donor. CYP activities show
long-term-stability for at least 28 days, which can be used for
chronic toxicity experiments. Moreover, the ability of MH
cells to model drug interactions in vitro provides novel
possibilities for investigation of drug interaction together
with long-term experiments. The differences between
individuals and genders that are supported by our findings
in combination with cryoconservation enables research
on individuals as well as a ‘population-based’ approach
using MH cells from donors with different gender and
co-medications.
