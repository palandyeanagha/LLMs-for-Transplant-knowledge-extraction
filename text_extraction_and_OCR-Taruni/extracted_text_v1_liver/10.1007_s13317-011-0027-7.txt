Abstract Environmental and genetic factors appear to be
involved in the pathogenesis of primary biliary cirrhosis
(PBC), a chronic cholestatic liver disease characterized by
immune-mediated destruction of the small and medium
sized intrahepatic bile ducts. Environmental factors include
exposure to various infectious, xenobiotic and chemical
compounds. These exposures may occur occupationally,
through water or air contamination, pharmacological
administration or by elective exposure, to name a few. Hair
dyes are compounds that have been implicated in the
development of several autoimmune diseases, including
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and PBC. So far, only
epidemiological studies have addressed the role of hair
dyes in PBC, with limited results. Hair dyes in SLE have
been examined, and have recently demonstrated an association, both epidemiologically and immunologically. This
follows a series of negative studies, which may not have
taken into account several features of hair dye use. This
review will examine the literature surrounding hair dye use
and SLE, and compare this to data surrounding PBC.
Treating physicians should be prepared for questions surrounding the need to take precautions against repeated hair
dye use and this topic is discussed further.

Introduction
Environmental factors combined with genetic susceptibility
are largely believed to be essential working partners in the
development of autoimmune disease [1–4]. The term ‘environmental factors’ or ‘environmental agents’ in the discussion
of the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease, is a blanket term
to address environmental components such as microbial
agents, vaccines, diet, drug exposure, heavy metals, ultraviolet radiation and smoking, among many others [3–9].
Monozygotic concordance rates below 50% are indicative that
environment as well as genetics are involved [10–13]. As well,
studies on genetically similar populations living under different conditions have demonstrated different incidence rates
of autoimmune disease. The induction of autoimmune disease
by these exposures may be through various mechanisms such
as the alteration of autoantigen structure, altered expression of

antigens, stimulatory effects on the immune system, T-cell
dysregulation, apoptosis-mediated autoimmunity, molecular
mimicry and immunological cross-reactivity [5, 14–18].
Cigarette smoking is one example of non-infectious
agents which have been studied in rheumatoid arthritis (RA),
autoimmune thyroiditis, inflammatory bowel disease, and
primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) [19–22]. Cigarette smoke
has been shown to increase the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and reduce the levels of anti-inflammatory
cytokines. Free radicals contained in cigarette smoke can
provoke cellular destruction and release of intracellular
autoantigens. Various toxins found within cigarette smoke
may cause DNA damage and genetic mutations, as well as
stimulate autoreactive T cells [21]. An alteration in oestrogen metabolism, which has been indicated as a feature in
autoimmune disease, has also been found to occur in active
smokers [23, 24]. However, the effect of tobacco smoke in
the loss of self-tolerance may be more complicated, as it
appears that smoking abstinence exacerbates gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). Such
an effect has not been noted in patients with Crohn’s disease,
the other major inflammatory bowel disease.
Silica exposure has also been investigated as a factor
involved in autoimmune disease [12, 25, 26]. Silica has been
linked with scleroderma, RA, vasculitis and systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE) [12, 25, 26]. Silica acts as an immune
stimulant, increasing pro-inflammatory cytokine production,
as well as inducing apoptosis and necrosis [12, 25, 26].
Interestingly, silica has also been shown to increase autoantibody production [27] and immune complex formation in
animal models. Animals exposed to silica have demonstrated
increases in B and CD4 T cell counts, as well as altering
T helper and T regulatory cell ratios [28]. Apart from silica,
exposure to solvents such as trichloroethylene, mineral spirits,
and petroleum based products have been linked to scleroderma
and other undifferentiated connective tissue diseases [29].
Primary biliary cirrhosis is one autoimmune disease in
which multiple environmental factors have been implicated. Hair dyes have been added to this list, but very few
studies address these compounds. Hair dyes have been
previously explored in relation to SLE, both epidemiologically and immunologically. This review will examine
the literature surrounding the use of hair dyes in SLE in
relation to PBC. As PBC and SLE very rarely co-occur in
an affected individual, the effect of hair dyes in either
disease may help us understand the complex role of these
compounds as environmental triggers of autoimmunity.
Primary biliary cirrhosis
PBC is a chronic cholestatic liver disease of autoimmune
origin, characterised by inflammatory destruction of the
small intrahepatic bile ducts, fibrosis progressing to cirrhosis and subsequent liver failure [30–32]. Many patients
are asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis [33–35]. PBC is
characterised by anti-mitochondrial (AMA) and diseasespecific antinuclear antibody (ANA), which are also found
in asymptomatic patients with normal or abnormal biochemical blood tests indicating cholestasis [30, 34, 36–38].
The most common presenting symptoms are those of fatigue, pruritus and arthralgias [30, 34, 39]. More severe
presenting symptoms are related to portal hypertension and
hepatic decompensation (jaundice, ascites or variceal
bleeding), leading to the need for liver transplantation [30,
34, 39]. However, North American and European studies
indicate that the percentage of patients with PBC who
require liver transplantation has fallen significantly [32]. In
general, the course of PBC is slow but unpredictable [30,
34, 35, 39]. Early treatment with urseodeoxycholic acid
(UDCA) has greatly improved survival rates and quality of
life in PBC patients [30–32]. Whether UDCA is solely anticholestatic or is also immunomodulatory is to be established [30, 32, 40, 41].
PBC is diagnosed on the basis of AMA in serum, biochemical markers of cholestasis, and histological features
diagnostic or compatible with PBC [30–32]. Biochemical
indices of cholestasis include increased levels of alkaline
phosphatase and cGT [30–32]. AMA and disease-specific
ANA are usually present at high titres [30, 36–38]. Occasionally, some patients are found to be negative for AMA
[36, 37, 42–47]. AMA titres do not appear to correlate with
the severity of the disease and do not seem to have any
known clinical significance. Disease-specific ANA appear
to be able to identify PBC patients with a more aggressive
disease [36–38, 44, 48–59]. PBC specific ANA patterns
detected by indirect immunofluorescence, include the
‘‘multiple nuclear dot’’ and ‘‘nuclear membrane/rim like’’
patterns [37, 38, 54, 60–62]. The ‘‘multiple nuclear dot’’
pattern is given by antibodies directed against nuclear body
proteins such as Sp100, Sp140, promyelocytic leukaemia
nuclear body proteins, and small ubiquitin-like modifiers
[30, 37, 38, 50, 56, 57, 59, 63–68]. The ‘‘nuclear envelope/
rim like pattern’’ corresponds to reactivities specific for
gp210 and nucleoporin p62 and other less studied antigens
of the nuclear membrane [54]. Up to 50% of PBC patients
are positive for these patterns in isolation or in combination,
compared to less than 1% of the pathological and healthy
controls indicating their significant disease specificity
[1, 54, 57]. Immunoglobulin M (IgM) is usually found to be
raised. Histological features typical for PBC include
destruction of biliary epithelial cells and loss of small bile
ducts with portal inflammatory cell infiltration [30–32].
The mechanisms responsible for the induction of autoimmunity are poorly understood. Several articles published
in this, as well as previous issues of the journal, are

focusing on the investigation of mechanisms inducing
autoimmunity and indeed autoimmune disease [18, 69–83].
The mechanism of molecular mimicry and immunological
cross-reactivity between infectious agents or xenobiotics
and disease-specific autoantigens has been used to explain
the loss of immunological tolerance in autoimmune gastrointestinal and liver diseases, including PBC [84–100].
Several environmental factors have been also implicated
in the development of PBC [6, 40, 41, 84, 92, 101–108].
These have included recurrent urinary tract infections [109,
110], xenobiotics [111, 112], and oestrogen deficiency [20,
113] to name a few. Clustering of PBC cases in New York
State [114], and the north of England [115] raise further
suspicion of environmental factors being involved [6, 104].
Epidemiological studies in PBC and hair dyes use
Epidemiological studies on PBC have demonstrated varying results as to whether hair dye use is a factor in the
development of PBC. A French study involving 222 PBC
patients and 509 controls was based on a questionnaire of
200 questions covering medical, surgical and reproductive
history, demographics and lifestyle [116]. Although exposure to cigarette smoke was found to be associated with
PBC, hair dye use was not [116]. In the PBC group, it was
found that the average exposures per year was 3.4 (±4.6),
which was not significantly different from the control
group with the average number of exposures being 3.5
(±4.5) [116]. A much larger study from the US involved
1,032 PBC patients and 1,041 controls matched for sex,
age, race and geographical location [20]. The PBC cohort
consisted of patients from 23 tertiary care centers for liver
disease across the US [20]. Controls were obtained from
random-digit dialing of individuals with listed phone
numbers [20]. All participants were given a questionnaire
by trained personnel, which evaluated social, demographic,
personal and family medical histories, lifestyle, and
reproductive factors. PBC patients were found to have used
hair dyes more frequently than controls (38 times per year
compared to 35 times per year) [20]. Nail polish use was
also found to be associated with PBC, and of note, the
authors indicated that this involved female cases only,
which does not appear to be the case with hair dyes [20]. A
large epidemiological study from the UK has also found an
association between PBC and hair dyes [113]. That study
involved two cohorts of PBC patients, with one group
consisting of 318 patients in an epidemiological group, and
2,258 patients from a PBC support group [113]. The control group was composed of 2,438 age and sex matched
controls. All participants were sent a postal questionnaire
on PBC risk factors. An association between hair dye use
and PBC was found in both groups of PBC patients. Hair
dye use preceded PBC diagnosis in 86% of the epidemiological PBC cases, and 87% of cases from the support
group [113]. It should also be noted that 50% of women in
all test groups reported previous hair dye use, compared to
only 1% of male participants [113].
These epidemiological studies do not appear to analyze
the relation of hair dyes with PBC separately in women and
men with this disease. In fact, it does not appear that an
analysis of hair dye use was limited to females in any
epidemiological study of PBC, unlike studies on hair dye
use in SLE [117–125]. As well, many epidemiological
reports do not indicate the time length of hair dye use, and
very few indicate whether hair dye use preceded the
diagnosis of PBC.
Hair dyes in SLE
Much like PBC, several pharmacological and chemical
materials have been implicated in the development of SLE,
including exogenous sex hormones, silica, silicone, solvents, pesticides, mercuric chloride and hair dyes [121].
Hair dyes are of particular interest, as they contain aromatic amines that have been found to induce SLE-like
symptoms [123]. An early case study by Freni-Titulaer
et al. [119] indicated a positive association between the use
of hair dyes and connective tissue disease. A larger study
was carried out by Petri and Allbritton [122] involving 218
SLE patients from the Hopkins Lupus Cohort, who were
asked to fill in a questionnaire on hair product use. Controls
were administered the same questionnaire, and consisted of
two groups, the first being 178 first and second degree
relatives, and the second being 168 best friends of the
patients [122]. That study found no significant relationship
between hair dye use and the development of SLE [122]. In
a prospective study of 106,391 patients, patients and controls were assessed (based on self-reporting) on hair dye
use every 2 years, from 1976 to 1982 [125]. Again, no
association was found, even in women with more than
15 years of hair dye use [125]. A longitudinal study by
Jimenez-Alonso and colleagues [120] examined whether
hair dyes played a role in the prognosis and course of SLE.
That study was comprised of 91 SLE and 22 cutaneous
lupus patients, divided into non-hair dye users, permanent
users, and users but not permanent ones (indicating occasional use, such as bleaching or lowlights) [120]. No significant difference was found in relation to a more severe
disease course in the two groups which used hair dyes, and
in fact, non-users had more renal involvement than the two
user groups [120].
Earlier studies into hair dyes and SLE largely pointed
away from hair dyes being involved, however more recent
studies have drawn attention back to hair dyes, with an

examination of the immunemodulatory effects of hair dye
use. A study by Cooper and colleagues [117] into SLE and
hair dye use, subdivided hair dye use into dyes and permanent compounds, as well as limiting their analysis to
females, due to the extremely low usage of hair dyes among
males. Two hundred and sixty-five SLE patients were
obtained from 34 rheumatology practices in Eastern and
Southern Carolina, with 355 age, sex, and geographically
matched controls obtained through a drivers licence registry
[117]. Both smoking and hair dye use were assessed through
a 60 min interview. No association between SLE and
smoking was found, however, permanent hair dye use was
associated with a small increase in the risk of developing
SLE, especially if they had used dark coloured dyes [117].
This association increased with a longer duration of use, and
there was little evidence of an association with temporary
use, or the use of hair straighteners [117]. As ANA is the
serological hallmark of SLE, Cooper et al. [118] examined
the association between ANA positivity and exposure to
environmental toxins, including hair dyes. Serum samples
from 266 population-based subjects were obtained, as were
occupational and hair dye usage histories [118]. Positivity
for ANA was found in 21 (8%) subjects, with an increased
prevalence found in those who had been exposed to silica,
dust, pesticides and UV radiation, and a smaller association
was found with hair dye usage [118].
The immunological effects of hair dye usage have been
examined recently in a study by Rubin and colleagues
[124], who studied the immune responses in mice repeatedly exposed to p-phenylenediamine (PPD), which is a
component of many hair dyes. Mice had PPD applied to the
dorsum of their ears, which was washed away after 30 min,
which was done over several weeks [124]. The same was
done for controls, which were exposed to a mixture of olive
oil and acetone [124]. Analyses were conducted over several weeks, in which the area of application was histologically examined, and lymph node extracts were analysed by
flow cytometry [124]. Increased cellular infiltration was
seen after multiple exposures, with the inflammatory
response peaking after 4 weeks of exposure to PPD [124].
After 4 weeks, it appeared that the inflammatory response
levelled off, indicating that a balance between pro and antiinflammatory mechanisms had occurred [124]. Flow
cytometry demonstrated increased proliferation of both
CD4? and CD8? T cells in mice exposed to PPD, with the
number of Th1 cells increasing with increased numbers of
exposure [124]. CD4?Foxp3? T regulatory (Treg) cells
gradually increased up to the fourth week of exposure, at
which point they outnumbered the IFNc and IL-17 producing T cells, and comprised 14% of the total CD4?
population [124]. A second series of analyses were conducted with hair dyes (as opposed to PPD alone), which
produced similar results, with the exception that there was
a higher Treg increase seen after hair dye exposure [124].
The above studies have demonstrated that hair dye use can
induce a pro-inflammatory immune response, as well as
possibly influencing the autoantibody profile. It appears
also that dye use may indeed lead to the manipulation of
suppressor mechanism which depending on the timing may
have an anti-inflammatory effect. As well, studies which
took into account the higher female preponderance of hair
treatment usage, in addition to examining various product
types, demonstrated a positive association between SLE
and hair product usage.
Hair dyes as a risk for PBC: time to revisit?
Studies examining the association between PBC and hair
dyes have been, at best, limited. Several factors addressed
in the analysis between hair dye use and SLE, have not
been addressed in PBC. First, epidemiological studies do
not appear to separate male from female PBC patients,
which may lead to an inaccurate prevalence of hair dye use.
Accepted risk factors for PBC, such as recurrent urinary
tract infections and oestrogen deficiency, have been analysed with the factor of female preponderance being taken
into account, but it is not clear as to whether this has been
done in regards to hair dyes. As well, they do not appear to
define various types of hair dyes, such as dark or light
colourings, as well as products used to straighten hair. Nor
do they address in detail the length of time that the patients
used the hair products for. Refinement of studies to address
these issues in SLE demonstrated a positive association
between exposure and disease.
Immunological studies have found an increase proinflammatory response in mice exposed to PPD and hair
dyes, which was followed by an increased regulatory T cell
response [124]. An increase in CD4?Foxp3? Tregs has
also been demonstrated in peripheral blood mononuclear
cells of PBC patients, also with increased IFNc [126].
Altered Treg function has been demonstrated to be a feature of PBC, or PBC-like pathology [127–130]. It could be
argued that exposure to chemical compounds may induce
pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses, the
former prevailing in genetically susceptible individuals,
thus contributing to the development of autoimmune disease. It would be of interest to see if any liver pathology is
present in animal models of hair dye exposure.
Hair dyes as a risk for advanced PBC: simple questions,
straight answers
A significant proportion of patients with PBC are aware
of the current research surrounding PBC risk factors.
4 Autoimmun Highlights (2013) 4:1–9
123

This information is readily available on the internet, as well as
in support groups for PBC patients. As a result, treating physicians should be prepared for questions surrounding the need
to take precautions against risk factors, such as repeated hair
dye use. In our practice, we ensure that patients are aware that
the number of studies performed, as well as the small cohort
sizes, prohibits any definitive conclusions from being made.
We also make clear to the patient, that the cessation of hair dye
use will likely not alter the course of their disease. It needs to
be clarified that there are no data to suggest that the continuous
exposure to synthetic dyes leads to more advanced disease.
We do not encourage patients with PBC to follow any specific
instructions, and avoid making any recommendations or
advice concerning specific products. Patients with chemical
sensitivities or allergies to unspecified chemical compounds
are advised to follow conventional precautions applied for
everyone. In a culture obsessed with beauty, youth and wellbeing, changing hair colour has become very common. There
is no doubt that hair dye use will continue among men and
women despite the potential risks, and it is likely that PBC
patients are not the exception.
Conclusion
The list of chemical compounds implicated in the development of autoimmune disease is immense. Hair dyes have
demonstrated an association with SLE development, but
only after study refinement. It is apparent that when taking
into account environmental components in the induction of
the disease, care must be given to analyse those results in
the context of the study population. Hair dyes are predominantly used by women, and studies must take this into
account. As well, the variety of products available must
also be addressed, as variability within a compound group
may give differing results. These factors are likely to be
involved in the limited studies associating hair dye use with
PBC. As well, animal models may clarify the immunological mechanisms involved in the process of PBC
induction and exposure to chemical compounds.
