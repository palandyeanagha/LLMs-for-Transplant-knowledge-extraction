Abstract. Acute liver damage is considered to be the major 
cause of mortality after massive hepatectomy. Prostaglandin 
E1 (PGE1) and somatostatin (SST) have been shown to 
protect against hepatic injury of rats after partial hepatectomy. 
However, the precise mechanisms remain largely unknown. 
In this study, we examined the effects of PGE1, SST and the 
combination of these two drugs on acute liver damage of rats 
after 90% hepatectomy. We found that animal survival was 
improved when pretreated with PGE1 and SST. Portal venous 
pressure (PVP), serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and 
aspartate aminotransaminase (AST), tumor necrosis factor-α
(TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were all reduced after 
administration of PGE1 and SST. In addition, apoptosis was 
inhibited via upregulation of Bcl-2 and downregulation of Bax 
and caspase-3 in drug treatment groups. Furthermore, pretreatment with PGE1 and SST alleviated endoplasmic reticulum 
(ER) stress by induction of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) 
and glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), but suppression of 
transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). Our 
data suggest that administration of PGE1 and SST, particularly 
in combination, may prevent acute liver damage of rats after 
massive hepatectomy by inhibiting inflammatory responses, 
apoptosis and ER stress.
Introduction
Liver cancer, particularly primary liver cancer, is the leading 
cause of cancer-related mortality in both men and women 
in China (1,2). At present, hepatectomy is recognized as the 
first-line therapeutic method for primary and metastatic liver 
tumors (3). However, liver resection is restricted by the need 
to preserve a sufficient amount of hepatocytes to maintain 
normal physiological function (4,5). Owing to improved 
understanding of the segmental anatomy of the liver and 
developments in surgical techniques, the mortality rate after 
liver resection has been reduced to 0-5% (6,7). Postresection 
liver failure (PLF), which is considered to be caused by excess 
inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen intermediates, 
apoptosis and disturbances of hepatic microcirculation, is 
the major cause of mortality following massive hepatectomy 
(8-11). Therefore, development of agents to prevent acute liver 
damage, particularly PLF, following liver resection, is of great 
significance in clinical application.
Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) exerts a broad range of effects 
on cytoprotection and is widely used as a vasodilator in 
clinical practice (12). It has been shown that administration of liposome PGE1 (Lipo-PGE1) in rats could suppress 
ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury of the liver by improving 
microcirculation, reducing portal venous pressure (PVP) and 
alleviating parenchyma injury (13). Matsuo et al (14) reported 
that PGE1 induces heat shock proteins (HSPs) immediately 
after hepatic I/R. The intraportal infusion of PGE1 prevents 
the accumulation of excessive ascites and hyperbilirubinemia in patients with small-for-size graft (15). Moreover, it 
has been demonstrated that pretreatment of rats with PGE1 
could improve the survival rate after massive hepatectomy 
by inhibiting apoptosis and stimulating hepatocyte proliferation as well as heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) accumulation 
(16-19). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms by 
which PGE1 exerts its protective effects on rats after massive 
hepatectomy are not fully elucidated. Therefore, a better 
understanding of such mechanisms will greatly promote the 
application of PGE1 to prevent acute liver damage after liver 
resection in the clinical setting.
Somatostatin (SST), a regulatory peptide hormone, is 
widely distributed in the body and is involved in multiple 
biological processes (20,21). Previous reports have documented that SST was able to suppress hepatic I/R injury (22)

and reduce PVP (23). Additionally, it has been shown that 
administration of SST or its analogues, octreotide, could 
exert protective effects against hepatic injury of rats undergoing partial hepatectomy and liver transplantation (24-28). 
However, it remains unknown whether SST possesses similar 
effects on rats undergoing massive hepatectomy.
In the present study, we used 90% hepatectomy of rats 
as a model to investigate whether SST can potentiate the 
therapeutical effects of PGE1 on rats undergoing massive 
liver resection. Our results showed that co-administration of 
PGE1 with SST attenuated acute liver damage after massive 
hepatectomy in rats more efficiently than either drug alone. 
The underlying mechanisms are associated with inhibition of 
inflammatory responses, apoptosis and endoplasmic reticulum 
(ER) stress.
Materials and methods
Animals and drugs. Male Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing 
250-350 g, were purchased from the Experimental Animal 
Center of Shengjing Hospital. They were housed in an airconditioned room at 25˚C with a controlled 12 h dark/light 
cycle. The animals received human care with unlimited access 
to chow and water. The surgeries were performed between 
9 a.m. and 5 p.m.. All rats were fasted for 12 h before surgery. 
The animal study protocol was reviewed and approved by 
the Ethics Committee of China Medical University. SST 
(100 µg/vial) was obtained from Sandoz (Basel, Switzerland) 
and dissolved in physiological saline. PGE1 (10 µg/vial) 
was purchased from Tide Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Beijing, 
China). One hundred micrograms PGE1 were dissolved in 
20 ml physiological saline. A dose of 0.5 µg/kg/min PGE1 and 
20 µg/kg body weight SST were used in the present study.
Experimental protocol. All rats were randomly divided into 
the control, SST, PGE1 or combined treatment group, with 
26 rats each group. Rats in the SST group were injected intravenously with SST (20 µg/kg body weight, dissolved in 1 ml 
physiological saline) 30 min before the operation. During the 
surgery, physiological saline was continuously pumped intravenously and the total volume was the same as PGE1 treatment. 
Another intravenous injection of SST (20 µg/kg body weight) 
was given after the hepatectomy. Rats in the PGE1 group 
received 1 ml physiological saline 30 min before the operation 
and continuous intravenous pumping (0.5 µg/kg/min) during 
the surgery. Instead of SST, 1 ml physiological saline was given 
after the operation. For the combined group, the treatment 
protocol was the same as the PGE1 group, except that SST 
(20 µg/kg body weight) was injected before or after the operation instead of physiological saline alone. Rats in the control 
group received physiological saline during the entire process. 
All animals were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital 
(40 mg/kg) and the surgery was performed as described by 
Togo et al (18). Briefly, the rats were placed in a supine position 
and then a midline incision was made. After detaching from 
surrounding tissues, the liver was pushed out. All rats received 
a hypodermic injection of 10% glucose after the hepatectomy. 
Animals were sacrificed (16 rats in each group) at 10 min, 6, 
12 and 24 h after the operation, except for survival observation 
(10 rats in each group). Liver specimens and blood samples 
were collected at each time point. The residual livers were 
fixed in 10% formalin or frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately, 
and were then subjected to histological examination or western 
blot analysis. PVP was measured by presser transducer which 
was placed into the portal vein after puncturing the vein with 
a 23-gauge needle. Activities of ALT and AST in serum were 
determined by the automatic Biochemistry Analyzer (Abbott 
Laboratories, Irving, TX, USA).
Histological examination. The remnant liver tissues were 
collected at 10 min, 6, 12 and 24 h after 90% hepatectomy for 
all groups. Liver samples were fixed in 10% neutral buffered 
formalin and then frozen section was performed. Subsequently, 
these sections were stained with routine hematoxylin and eosin 
(H&E) to evaluate the morphological alterations by using a 
standard protocol.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). ELISA kits 
(Senxiong Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) were 
used to measure the concentration of tumor necrosis factor-α
(TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in serum according to the 
manufacturer's instructions. The sample concentrations were 
calculated from a standard curve and expressed as pg/ml.
Western blot analysis. Liver tissues were obtained at 10 min, 
6, 12 and 24 h after 90% hepatectomy from all groups. The 
samples were weighed, sectioned and then washed with 0.9% 
NaCl. The homogenates were sonicated for 5 sec, 20-30 times, 
and then centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 30 min at 4˚C. Following 
centrifugation, supernatant was collected and the protein 
concentrations were determined using a bovine serum albumin 
(BSA) standard line. Equal amounts of protein were separated 
on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 
(SDS-PAGE) and then transferred electrophoretically onto 
polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore, 
Bedford, MA, USA). The blotted membranes were blocked with 
5% non-fat dry milk (w/v) in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% 
Tween-20 (TBST). Subsequently, the membranes were incubated with anti-TNF-α, IL-6, Bax, Bcl-2, caspase-3, HSP70, 
glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and CHOP antibodies, 
respectively (1:1,000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., 
Santa Cruz, CA, USA) overnight at 4˚C. After three rinses 
with TBST at 10-min intervals, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG 
(1:5,000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.,) for 2 h at 
room temperature. Then, protein bands were visualized by an 
ECL plus chemiluminescence kit (Millipore). Glyceraldehyde3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as a loading 
control.
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end 
labeling (TUNEL) staining. Apoptosis was evaluated by the 
TUNEL staining which was performed with a commercially 
available in situ cell death detection kit (ZSGB-Bio Co., Ltd., 
Beijing, China), according to the manufacturer's instructions. 
Liver samples were embedded in paraffin and then sectioned 
at a thickness of 4 µm. The sections were dewaxed in xylene 
and rehydrated through a graded series of ethanol (100-70%). 
Then, the sections were digested with proteinase K (40 µg/ml) 
for 10 min at 37˚C. After digestion, the sections were incubated 

418 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR MEDICINE 31: 416-422, 2013
with 3% H2O2 for 10 min at room temperature to block the 
endogenous peroxidase activity. The slides were covered with 
citric acid buffer for 5 min and then with working solution 
which contained TdT enzyme overnight at 4˚C. After washing 
with PBS, the slides were incubated with peroxidase for 1 h 
at 37˚C. The color was developed with the DAB substrate kit 
and the reactions were terminated by tap water. The sections 
were then counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated and 
mounted. Total hepatocytes and apoptotic cells were counted 
from 5 random high-power fields for each section. Apoptotic 
index (apoptotic cells/100 hepatocytes) was used to evaluate 
the effect of PGE1 and SST on apoptosis after 90% hepatectomy.
Statistical analysis. All data analyses were performed with 
SPSS 17.0 software package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) 
and are presented as the means ± standard deviation (SD). 
Statistical analysis was evaluated by one-way ANOVA followed 
by LSD test unless otherwise stated. Survival rates after 90% 
hepatectomy were expressed using the Kaplan-Meier curves. 
The log-rank test was used for the survival statistics. P<0.05 
was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.
Results
Co-administration of PGE1 with SST improves survival in 
rats after massive hepatectomy. To investigate the protective 
effects of PGE1 and SST on rats after massive hepatectomy, 
rats were treated as described in Materials and methods, and 
the survival of these rats was recorded for 7 days after 90% 
hepatectomy. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze 
the obtained results. We found that both PGE1 and SST 
ameliorated the survival rate of rats after 90% hepatectomy 
compared with the control group (P<0.05, log-rank test). The 
survival rate was improved significantly by co-administration 
of these two drugs (P<0.01, log-rank test) (Fig. 1). Our data 
suggest that co-administration of PGE1 with SST exerts a 
much stronger protective effect on rats following massive 
hepatectomy than either drug alone.
Co-administration of PGE1 with SST attenuates liver injury 
in rats following massive hepatectomy. Previous reports have 
shown that acute portal hypertension after hepatectomy could 
induce liver injury (29,30). To determine whether PGE1 and 
SST can attenuate liver injury caused by acute portal hypertension in rats after massive hepatectomy, PVP was measured 
at different time points. As shown in Fig. 2A, rapid increases 
in PVP were observed 10 min after 90% hepatectomy in rats 
in all treatment groups. However, pretreatment with PGE1 and 
SST, either alone or in combination, significantly inhibited the 
increase in PVP compared to the control group (P<0.01).
Next, we analyzed the releases of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransaminase (AST) in 
serum which was used as an indicator of liver injury. The 
obtained results showed that the serum levels of ALT and 
AST were elevated postoperatively in all groups. In contrast 
to the control group, co-administration of PGE1 with SST 
significantly reduced ALT and AST in serum (P<0.001) 
(Fig. 2B and C). H&E staining results showed that no obvious

histological alterations were observed 10 min after 90% 
hepatectomy (Fig. 3). However, pathological changes, such 
as disorder structure of hepatic lobules, enlarged hepatic 
sinus, liver cell swelling and partial necrosis, appeared 24 h 
after massive hepatectomy in the control group (Fig. 3). 
Co-administration of PGE1 with SST abated these changes 
more efficiently than either PGE1 or SST alone (Fig. 3). 
Collectively, our data demonstrate that co-administration of

PGE1 with SST attenuates liver injury in rats after massive 
hepatectomy.
Production of inflammatory cytokines is suppressed in rats 
after massive hepatectomy by co-administration of PGE1 
with SST. Inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-6, 
have been shown to be involved in liver failure after massive 
resection (31,32). Therefore, contents of TNF-α and IL-6 
were determined in serum and the remnant liver. As shown 
in Fig. 4A and B, TNF-α and IL-6 were minimally expressed 
10 min after 90% hepatectomy in serum from all groups. 
Twenty-four hours postoperatively, the levels of TNF-α and 
IL-6 were greatly increased in the control group. By contrast, 
these increases were significantly attenuated by administration of PGE1 and SST. Pretreatment with PGE1 alone was 
more effective than combined with SST in terms of inhibiting 
inflammatory cytokine accumulation in serum. We found 
similar results in remnant liver, except that co-administration 
of PGE1 with SST exhibited the most effective inhibition 
effect than either drug alone (Fig. 4C).
Co-administration of PGE1 with SST inhibits apoptosis in 
rats after massive hepatectomy. To investigate the effects of 
PGE1 and SST on apoptosis, TUNEL assays were performed. 
The results indicated that the apoptotic index (AI) increased 
over time for all groups. Twenty-four hours postoperatively, 
the AI value decreased from 40.25±2.99% for the control 
group to 29.25±2.21, 31±2.16, 24.5±2.08% for the SST, 
PGE1 and combined treatment groups, respectively (Fig. 5A). 
Co-administration of PGE1 with SST suppressed apoptosis 
more efficiently than either alone as evidenced by less TUNELpositive staining (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, we observed that 
pretreatment with PGE1 and SST downregulated expression 
levels of Bax and caspase-3 and upregulated Bcl-2, particularly in the combined treatment group (Fig. 5C). These results 
indicate that co-administration of PGE1 with SST suppresses 
apoptosis in rats after liver resection.
Co-administration of PGE1 with SST alleviates ER stress 
in rats after massive hepatectomy. In order to eliminate ER 
stress, eukaryotic cells initiate unfolded protein response 
(UPR) which involves suspension of protein synthesis and 
upregulation of molecular chaperones. To explore whether 
PGE1 and SST alleviate ER stress, we analyzed the expression of UPR related proteins. Western blotting results showed 
that the expression levels of two molecular chaperones, HSP70 
and GRP78, were significantly increased by co-administration 
of PGE1 with SST compared to the control group (Fig. 6). 
Transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), 
whose expression is upregulated by ER stress, is involved in 
ER stress-induced apoptosis (33). We found that pretreatment 
with PGE1 and SST significantly inhibited the expression of 
CHOP, particularly in the combined group (Fig. 6). These data 
suggest that co-administration of PGE1 with SST alleviates 
ER stress in the remnant liver.
Discussion
In the present study, we examined the protective effects 
of PGE1 and SST in rats after 90% hepatectomy. Our data 
demonstrated that co-administration of PGE1 with SST 
attenuates liver injury and improves the survival rates in rats 
after massive hepatectomy more efficiently than either treatment alone. The underlying mechanisms include inhibition of 
inflammatory responses and apoptosis, and alleviation of ER 
stress.
Liver failure after massive hepatic resection is considered a 
major contributor to postoperative mortality (3). The development of liver failure involves several causes, such as excess 
inflammatory response, impaired liver regeneration and 
induction of apoptosis, abnormal hemodynamics, I/R injury 
and sepsis (34). Therefore, drug combinations which can 
exert multiple therapeutical actions are preferable. According 
to earlier findings, both PGE1 and SST have been shown to 
protect against liver injury produced by I/R injury and partial 
hepatectomy (13,16,22,25). The results obtained in the present 
study showed that application of PGE1 or SST significantly 
improved survival, reduced PVP, ALT, AST and alleviated the 
histological changes of rats after 90% hepatectomy. In particular, the combination of these two drugs exhibited a much 
stronger protective effect than either drug alone. It should also 
be noted that co-administration of PGE1 with SST did not 
show a significant difference in reducing PVP compared to 
PGE1 or SST alone. This may be due to the major effect of 
PGE1 on liver hemodynamics in increasing portal venous flow 
rather than reducing PVP (35).
Typically pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and 
IL-6, participate in the initiation of liver regeneration (36). A 
previous report showed that impaired liver regeneration after 
partial hepatectomy in ICAM-1 deficient mice is associated 
with a marked decrease in tissue TNF-α and IL-6 levels. In 
addition, injection of recombinant IL-6 could restore the proliferation of hepatocytes (37). Receptor for advanced glycation 
end products (RAGE) inhibits regeneration after massive liver 
injury by suppression of TNF-α (38). It has been shown that 
cold ischemia suppresses liver regeneration after partial liver 
transplantation in rats by decreasing the production of TNF-α
and IL-6 in rats (39). However, excessive releases of these 
cytokines are tightly related to liver failure after massive hepatectomy. Ogata et al (32) reported that suppression of excessive 
TNF-α production using ONO-SM362, a TNF-α suppressant, 
ameliorates liver failure after 85% hepatectomy. Another study 
Figure 6. Effects of PGE1 and SST on ER stress. Western blotting results

results of three independent experiments are shown. GAPDH was used as a 
loading control.

also showed that enhanced expressions of TNF-α are detected 
in rats after 85% hepatectomy which exhibit extensive patchy 
necrosis as compared with 70% hepatectomy (31). The results 
obtained in our present study are consistent with previous 
reports. We found that expressions of TNF-α and IL-6 were 
significantly increased 24 h after 90% hepatectomy both in 
serum and the remnant liver. Furthermore, application of PGE1 
and SST was able to downregulate the excessive expressions 
of TNF-α and IL-6 and thus alleviate liver injury. In addition, 
these cytokine levels were relatively higher even after administration of PGE1 and SST. This may be a benefit for maintaining 
and promoting regeneration of the remnant liver. However, the 
mechanisms animals use to maintain the balance of TNF-α
and IL-6 between liver injury and regeneration remain to be 
elucidated. Co-administration of PGE1 with SST inhibited 
the production of TNF-α and IL-6 in the remnant liver more 
efficiently than in serum.
Apoptosis and necrosis of the remnant hepatocytes further 
aggravate liver injury and eventually result in liver failure 
following massive hepatectomy (8). Upregulation of caspases 
and Fas and downregulation of Bcl-2 have been found in rats 
which died of hepatic failure within 96 h after 95% hepatectomy (40). A previous study demonstrated that pretreatment 
with PGE1 significantly increases the expression levels of 
Bcl-xL in rats after 95% hepatectomy and thus improves the 
survival of these animals (16). Our results further confirmed 
the above findings. We observed that apoptosis increased 
significantly in rats 24 h after 90% hepatectomy. However, 
co-administration of PGE1 with SST reduced the occurrence 
of apoptosis markedly compared to the control group. Further 
analyses demonstrated that administration of PGE1 or SST 
in rats after 90% hepatectomy downregulated the expression 
levels of pro-apoptotic Bax and caspase-3, whereas it induced 
the accumulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and eventually 
inhibited apoptosis. Therefore, PGE1 and SST exert protective 
effects on rats after massive hepatectomy at least partially by 
inhibiting apoptosis.
The accumulation of misfolded proteins in the lumen of the 
ER results in ER stress. UPR, including suspension of protein 
synthesis, upregulation of molecular chaperones and accumulation of folding enzymes, is activated to eliminate such stress 
(41). ER stress has been observed among various liver diseases, 
such as chronic viral hepatitis B and C, I/R injury and alcoholinduced liver injury (42). However, the precise role of ER stress 
in rats after massive hepatectomy has yet to be demonstrated. 
HSP70 and GRP78 are two molecular chaperones that facilitate protein folding and thus eliminate ER stress. Enhanced 
expression of HSP70 has been found in rats after 95% hepatectomy (18). However, sustained ER stress can lead to apoptosis 
(41). It has been shown that deletion of the transcription factor 
CHOP protects against ER stress-induced apoptosis (33). In 
the present study, we found that co-administration of PGE1 
with SST greatly upregulated the protein expression levels 
of HSP70 and GRP78 and thus may contribute to alleviating 
the ER stress induced by hepatectomy. Moreover, CHOP was 
significantly inhibited when pretreated with the combination 
of PGE1 and SST. Therefore, co-administration of PGE1 with 
SST may exert a protective effect against rats after massive 
hepatectomy partially by inhibiting apoptosis induced by 
excessive ER stress.
In conclusion, our data demonstrated that co-administration of PGE1 with SST attenuated the acute liver damage 
of rats after 90% hepatectomy. The potential mechanisms 
included inhibition of inflammatory responses and apoptosis, 
and alleviation of ER stress induced by hepatectomy. Our findings have broad implications in promoting the application of 
the combination of these two drugs in clinical settings against 
liver failure after massive hepatectomy.
