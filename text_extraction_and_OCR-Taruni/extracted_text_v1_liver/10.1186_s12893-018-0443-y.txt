Abstract
Background: Laparoscopic Kasai portoenterostomy (LKPE) is performed for biliary atresia (BA). As LKPE is a
technically demanding operation, a learning curve should be defined to guide training. The aim of this study
was to identify the learning curve of LKPE for BA.
Methods: Metrics of perioperative safety and efficiency for 100 cases of LKPE were evaluated. Outcomes were
followed to 67.2 ± 12.1 months. Cumulative sum (CUSUM) analysis was used to identify inflexion point corresponding
to the learning curve. Outcome measures included operative time (ORT), rate of clearance of jaundice (CJ) and survival
with native liver (SNL).
Results: Between May 2009 and May 2013, 100 consecutive patients with BA underwent LKPE. The rate of conversion
from LKPE to open Kasai portoenterostomy (OKPE), intraoperative transfusion and any perioperative complications was
11, 26 and 16%, respectively. There was no perioperative mortality. The CUSUM analysis revealed a learning curve of 50
for LKPE. Precipitous ORT reductions from an initial mean operative time of 316.3 min that was observed in the first 50
to 232.2 min of the late 50 cases (P < 0.01). Subsequently, cases 1 to 50 were considered ‘early experience’, whereas
cases 51 and higher were considered as ‘late experience’ for statistical analysis. The rate of CJ and SNL was significantly
higher after the early 50 cases (P < 0.05). In contrast, the rate of intraoperative transfusion, the median time of oral
feeding initiated after operation, and the length of hospital stay was not different between the both groups (P > 0.05).
Conclusions: In this experience, improved perioperative and postoperative parameters for LKPE were observed in the
last 50 patients when compared with the first 50 patients. The dedicated training is likely to contribute to significantly
shorter learning curves in future adopters.

Background
Laparoscopic Kasai portoenterostomy (LKPE) has first
been applied to biliary atresia (BA) by Esteves in 2002
[1]. Previously, LKPE had not been showed to be as
efficacious as the open Kasai portoenterostomy (OKPE)
[2–4]. However, recent reports revealed that the 3- and
5-year survivals with native liver (SNL) after LKPE were
not inferior to that after OKPE [5, 6]. Similar to other
laparoscopic procedures, a learning curve may exist for
LKPE, which, if identified, may allow new adopters to
improve their insight. For LKPE, the learning curve may
entail the mastery of key points of this specific procedure. These key points include optimal port placement,
the full exposure of porta hepatis, the appropriate level
of resection of fibrous cone, the demanding technique of
portoenterostomy, the development of close coordination between the console surgeon and bedside assistant,
and the overcoming of the loss of tactile feedback.
The present paper reports the clinical data of the first
100 cases of LKPE, which were accomplished at our hospital, with the purpose of discerning major inflexion
points and landmarks in the optimization of perioperative outcomes. * Correspondence: xzcxewk@163.com 1

Methods
Design and study population
The first 100 consecutive cases of LKPE were reviewed
retrospectively. All operations were carried out by the
same surgical team with substantial laparoscopic experiences at West China Hospital of Sichuan University between May 2009 and May 2013. Approval was obtained
from the West China Hospital of Sichuan University Institutional Review Board. All procedures followed the research protocols approved by Sichuan University and
West China Hospital of Sichuan University and was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Written
informed consent was provided by the patients’ parents
for their clinical records to be used in this study.
Operative technique
The operative technique of LKPE has already been described in a previous study from our group [7]. Briefly, a
percutaneous suture was used to snare the round and
falciform ligament and retract the liver. Afterward, another two percutaneous transhepatic sutures were introduced individually into the left lobe and right lobe for
better hilar exposure. The atretic gallbladder and cystic
duct were dissected free from the gall bladder fossa. The
distal part of the extrahepatic duct was divided behind
the duodenum with 5 mm monopolar hook. After the
base of the fibrous cone was reached, the fibrous cord
was transected carefully with laparoscopic scissors. The
level of resection of fibrous cone was depended on the
appearance of bile juice secreted at the fibrous stump.
Bleeding from the fibrous remains of portal plate was
controlled by direct pressure with moist gauze. Next, a
25-cm Roux-en-Y limb was fashioned and delivered to
the hilum through a retro-colic path after the pneumoperitoneum was re-established.
Definitions and postoperative management
ORT was calculated as the length of time between skin incision and closure. Perioperative complications were complications that occurred during the perioperative period.
Theses perioperative complications included wound infection, umbilical hernia, displacement of peritoneal drainage, omentum prolapsed through the trocar wound,
respiratory infection, intestinal anastomotic fistula, adhesive intestinal obstruction, etc. Clearance of jaundice (CJ)
or jaundice free was defined as the total bilirubin level <
1.2 mg/dL. Early CJ or jaundice free was defined as the
total bilirubin level < 1.2 mg/dL within 6 months postoperatively. Incidence of cholangitis was defined as
elevated serum bilirubin (> 2.5 mg/dL), leukocytosis
with left shift, and normal to acholic stools in a febrile
patient (> 38.0 °C).
Steroids, intravenous antibiotics and ursodeoxycholic
acid were prescribed to all patients. Methylprednisolone
was administered intravenously one day postoperatively
at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day for at least 2 weeks. The intravenous antibiotics were administered postoperatively for
2–4 weeks. Patients were followed up regularly until the
end of the study.
Statistical analysis
The software applied for statistical calculation was IBM
SPSS 22.0 for windows 10.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA). In addition to ORT, the rate of CJ, survival with
native liver (SNL) and other demographic data were also
analyzed. The differences of SNL among the two groups
were analyzed by the Kaplan–Meier Method with endpoints of death or liver transplantation and compared by
using the log-rank test. Student’s t-test and chi-squared
were used to analyze continuous variables and qualitative variables, respectively. P-values less than 0.05 were
considered to be statistically significant.
Cumulative sum analysis of operative time
Cumulative sum (CUSUM) is the accumulated total difference between each data point and the mean of all
data points for a particular metric. CUSUM analysis was
well suited to and widely employed in the assessment of
new technical skills [8–10]. CUSUM analysis was performed starting with the earliest surgical date. All patients were ordered chronologically. The difference
between ORT of each of the 100 cases and the mean
ORT of all cases (M-ORT) was then obtained. The
CUSUM of ORT was obtained by adding up the calculated difference from the overall mean, starting with the
first case to the next cumulatively. If the ORT for a case
is more than M-ORT, the addition to the running value
of CUSUM of ORT is a positive number (upwards slope
on the graph). Conversely, it is a negative number if
the ORT for a case is less than M-ORT (downwards
slope). This cumulative process is sustained until
CUSUM of ORT for the last case is calculated as
zero. This allows for a graphical representation of the
learning curve, which can be calculated and plotted
with the software of Matlab 2016a for Windows 10.0
(Mathworks, Natick, MA).
Results
Perioperative outcomes for the entire cohort
Table 1 demonstrates perioperative parameters for the entire cohort of patients (n = 100). All included cases were
non-syndromic BA. The Type III, II and cyst were 97, 2
and 1%, respectively. A total of 64.0% were female. The median age of the patients was 82.8 days. The median weight
was 4.4 kg. The median time of ORT, oral feeding initiated
after operation and length of hospital stay was 274 min, 4.2
days and 23.6 days, respectively. The rate of conversion
from LKPE to OKPE, intraoperative transfusion and any

perioperative complications was 11, 26 and 16%. No patients died during the perioperative period. After a median
time of 67.2 months follow-up, the rates of cholangitis and
CJ were 66 and 62%, respectively. The 1-year, 3-year and
5-year SNL rate were 66, 49 and 34%, respectively.
Identification of learning curve based on CUSUM of ORT
CUSUM revealed ORT as the one of variables to exhibit
improvement across all the patients, whose results of
ORT were divided into 10 groups chronologically (Fig. 1).
We found that ORT was the only variable to exhibit

improvement across the 10 groups (data not shown). A
significant reduction in ORT was displayed after the first
50 cases (from 316.3 min to 232.2 min; P < 0.01) (Fig. 2).
These findings confirmed that the two distinct phases of
the learning curve in the first 50 cases, followed by a
predominantly downward slope. Patients were stratified
into 2 groups of 50 patients, with chronological order
defining early and late experience. Furthermore, the
ORTs beyond the learning curve continued to improve
gradually.
Perioperative outcomes in relation to the learning curve
Based on the identification of the ORT learning curve of
50 cases, an analysis of perioperative outcomes comparing those of in the learning curve cohort (first 50 cases
were assigned to ‘early experience’ or group A), with
those in the later experience (post-learning curve cohort:
cases 51–100 were assigned to group B) was performed.
The two groups were homogeneous with respect to age,
female ratio, weight, and type of BA of patients (Table
1). The conversion rate from LKPE to OKPE in group A
was much higher than that in group B (P < 0.01). The
perioperative complications in group A were more common than that in group B (P < 0.05). When compared
between the both groups, the rate of intraoperative
transfusion, the median time of oral feeding initiated
after operation, and the length of hospital stay was not
different respectively. The postoperative cholangitis in
Group B was significant lower than that in Group A (P
< 0.01). In contrast, the CJ rate in Group B was significant higher than that in Group A (P < 0.05). The median
time of follow up was 76.7 months in Group A and 57.5
months in Group B, respectively. The Kaplan–Meier
method analysis showed that SNL rate in Group A was
significant difference when compared with that in Group
B (P < 0.05) (Fig. 3).
Discussion
The adaptations of new technologies are challenges particularly in the practice of medicine [11–15]. There is
evidence that the effect of experience is clearly cumulative and can be carried over to later performance [11–
18]. With the aim to better understanding of surgeons’
performance during our experience with LKPE, we used
CUSUM technology, with combination of CJ and SNL
rates, to identify the number of cases that are necessary
to achieve the competence of LKPE. These efforts could
facilitate more effective training and improve the results
of LKPE.
The CUSUM technique is widely used to analyze the
learning curve for surgical procedure [11, 12] and transforms raw data into running total data deviation from
their group mean, enabling investigators to visualize the
milestone of learning curve. In this analysis, CUSUM
yielded a parabolic curve showing two distinct phases
from which correlates of the LKPE learning curve can be
assessed. The median ORTs during the first and second
phases were 316.3 min and 232.2 min, respectively. The
first phase of steep CUSUM of ORT rapidly rise at case
1~ 20, with a relative stabilization at case 20~ 50, can be
attributed to increased familiarity with the ‘basics’ of the
performance. These include the optimal port placement,

CUSUM of ORT is plotted on the vertical axis against the respective case number. Phase 1 reveals a sharp rise in CUSUM of ORT before the first
20 cases. Phase 2 displays a significant reduction in CUSUM of ORT after case 20, followed by a very slow increase in CUSUM of ORT with
stabilization near case 50. Phase 3 indicates a significant reduction in CUSUMORT after case 50

the full exposure of porta hepatis, the initial improvement of skills in dissection, the hemostasis, and the portoenterostomy. The phase 2 after case 50 is likely to
represent the steep learning curve that reflects the surgeon’s development of ability.
As shown, patients in both groups were similar in
terms of demographics, weight, and type of BA, suggesting that minimal selection bias was present to influence our results. The conversion rate from LKPE
to OKPE, any perioperative complications rate, and
cholangitis rate was 20, 24 and 78% in group A, each
of which was significant higher than that observed in
group B. In addition, the CJ rate and SNL rate in
group A were worse than that in group B. All perioperative results of both groups mentioned above are
highly consistent with the learning curve of LKPE,
which was plotted by the cumulative calculation of
CUSUM of ORT. A possible explanation for these
progression observed in the late-experience period is
that the surgeons became more comfortable with
postoperative care as they gained experience with the
operation.
Interestingly, we observed similar rates of rate of intraoperative transfusion. Although perioperative complications rate increased substantially in group B, this finding
did not translate into an overall prolonged hospital
length of stay. We found that the median time of oral
feeding initiated after operation and the length of hospital stay was not different between two groups.
The 50 cases of learning curve in our study was more
than that reported by Li et al. [19]. The authors drew
the conclusion that without the usage of Cumulative
sum analysis for ORT and Kaplan–Meier analysis for
SNL. Nevertheless, we agree with Li that LKPE is really
a demanding procedure, especially for novices and those
in hospitals with low caseload of BA. In addition, the 50
cases of learning curve of LKPE is more than that of laparoscopic procedure for choledochal cyst reported by
Diao’s (35 cases) [20] and that of LPCC reported by
Zhe’s (37 cases) [21]. The younger age at operation, the

poor exposure of porta hepatis, the difficult assessment
for level of dissecting biliary fibrous cone, the challenging procedure for portoenterostomy, all of which may
contribute to the “long” learning curve of LKPE.
The age at operation from 1 month to 4 months in
our study means that the peritoneal space for manipulation of LKPE is limited. Usually, the full exposure of
porta hepatis is often difficult, especially during the
initial phase of learning curve. We found that the
porta hepatis could be totally displayed by suspension
of the segment IV only with percutaneous transhepatic
suture. Under the magnification of laparoscopy, the
view of operative field can be shown clearly and stably
on the screen. Furthermore, the proper level of resecting the bilious fibrous cone is hard to be reached
under laparoscopy. Our experiences are that the fibrous cone should be dissected between the first bifurcation of portal vein, and gradually pushed deeper
until the leakage or oozing of bile-like liquid is found
on the surface of the fibrous stump. Therefore, the
base of the fibrous cone would be kept intact. When
the portoenterostomy is undertaken, the seams of the
anastomoses should be kept as far as possible from the
surface of the stump. In addition, the rigorous steroids
and prophylactic antibiotic treatment for cholangitis
after operation is also necessary for achievement for
better long-term results.
Although the outcomes of LKPE are not satisfied with
OKPE in some reports [6, 22, 23], our recent study revealed that the 3-year and 5 year SNL rates after LKPE
were not different compared to those after OKPE. Because BA is a rare disease, the experiences of LKPE are
incapable to be cumulated to proficiency in a short time,
especially in hospitals or centers with the low caseload
of BA. However, the learning curve of LKPE can be
shortened by training in the animal experiments, the
training devices, such as laparoscopic box and the virtual
reality laparoscopic simulator.
Our study has several limitations. Firstly, as a retrospective review, nearly all cases are typeIII nonsyndromic BA, which may not fully represent the entire
population of BA. Most patients of syndromic BA in our
hospital were given up by their parents, which could
have an impact on the learning curve of LKPE. Secondly,
the learning curve may actually be shorter than 50 cases
for surgeons already experienced in some facets of
laparoscopic surgery. The staffs with prior laparoscopic
experience and training have been able to climb this
learning curve much more rapidly, especially that there
are many cases of BA performed each year. Thirdly, the
present learning curve analysis is based mainly on ORT,
CJ and SNL, which probably failed to display constant
significant improvements as a result of small sample
sizes.
Conclusions
In conclusion, the current study identifies the learning
curve of LKPE to be approximately 50 cases performed
by one team of surgeons with some laparoscopic experiences. The learning curve of LKPE is perhaps more
pronounced than many other advanced laparoscopic
procedures. The mentorship and dedicated training are
likely to contribute to the significant shortening of the
learning curve of LKPE in future adopters.
