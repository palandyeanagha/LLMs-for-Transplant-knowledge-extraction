BACKGROUND: Cure from chronic hepatitis C virus
(HCV) infection is readily achievable with direct-acting
antivirals (DAA), but little is known about optimal management after treatment. Weight gained after DAA treatment may mitigate benefits or increase risk for liver disease progression. As the single largest sample of HCVinfected individuals receiving DAA treatment in the United States, the Veterans Affairs (VA) Birth Cohort is an ideal
setting to assess weight gain after DAA treatment.
METHODS: We performed a prospective study of patients
dispensed DAA therapy from January 2014 to June 2015.
Weight change was calculated as the difference in weight
from sustained virologic response (SVR) determination to
2 years later. Demographic, weight, height, prescription,
laboratory, and diagnosis code data were used for covariate definitions. We used multiple logistic regression to
assess the association between candidate predictors and
excess weight gain (≥ 10 lbs) after 2 years.
RESULTS: Among 11,469 patients, 78.0% of patients
were already overweight or obese at treatment initiation.
Overall, SVR was achieved in 97.0% of patients. After
2 years, 52.6% of patients gained weight and 19.8%
gained excess weight. In those with SVR, weight gain
was as high as 38.2 lbs, with the top 10% gaining ≥
16.5 lbs. Only 1% of those with obesity at treatment initiation normalized their weight class after 2 years. Significant predictors of post-SVR weight gain were SVR
achievement, lower age, high FIB-4 score, cirrhosis, and
weight class at treatment initiation.
CONCLUSION: Weight gain is common after DAA treatment, even among those who are overweight or obese
prior to treatment. Major predictors include age, baseline
weight, alcohol, cirrhosis, and SVR. Everyone receiving
DAAs should be counseled against weight gain with a
particular emphasis among those at higher risk.

INTRODUCTION
Now that sustained virologic response (SVR) with directacting antivirals (DAA) exceeds 90%, we need evidence to
inform management in the post-DAA treatment setting.1–3 For
those achieving SVR, the American Association of the Study
of Liver Diseases (AASLD) recommends “evaluation for
modifiable risk factors for liver injury, such as … fatty liver,
and diabetes mellitus,” and to “continue disease-specific management to optimize weight loss and glycemic control”.
4 SVR
is also thought to reduce liver-related and overall mortality and
improve extrahepatic manifestations such as diabetes.5–8
However, as obesity and insulin resistance are important risk
factors for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), weight
gain after DAA treatment may limit or even reverse the
benefits gained from SVR achievement.

There is little research describing weight change after DAA
treatment, since weight loss was a common adverse effect of
prior, interferon-based therapies.9–11 There is some evidence
that weight gain may occur after DAA treatment and SVR
achievement. Recently, increased skeletal muscle mass without weight gain12 and modest weight gain of 3.2 lbs13 have
been reported. However, these studies were limited by small
sample sizes (32 and 76 patients) and 1-year follow-up.
Further study is warranted because weight gain in patients
after attaining SVR may predispose them to liver disease
progression, including NAFLD, incident diabetes mellitus,
and liver fibrosis progression.14 At present, NAFLD is a
growing public health issue in the United States (U.S.) and
has been worsening since the 1980s concurrently with the
obesity epidemic.15–17 NAFLD is the second most common
liver disease among adults awaiting liver transplantation and
in the near future is expected to substantially increase in
prevalence.18, 19 NAFLD and fibrosis progression may in turn
place these patients at risk for cirrhosis and hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC).20–22 Thus, we aimed to explore and characterize weight gain after DAA therapy and identify predictors
of weight gain, using a nationwide prospective cohort of
veterans treated in the U.S. Veterans Affairs (VA) Healthcare
System. We hypothesized that this patient population would
gain weight after 2 years of follow-up.
METHODS
Study Database
The VA Birth Cohort is a nationwide, prospective cohort study
of all U.S. veterans born in 1945–1965. This population bears
a disproportionate burden of HCV disease compared with
other birth years, leading to recommendation for one-time
HCV screening, regardless of other risk factors.23, 24 Information was obtained from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse, the
central repository of nationwide patient-level data of veterans
receiving care from all U.S. VA care sites. Extracted data
included patient-level demographic, anthropometric, clinical,
prescription, laboratory, procedure, and diagnosis data. Inpatient and outpatient diagnoses were obtained through International Classification of Diseases, 9th and 10th revisions (ICD9/10) diagnosis codes. Surgical procedures were recorded by
Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes. This data is
hosted and accessed through the VA Informatics and Computing Infrastructure (VINCI).23, 25
Study Design and Inclusion Criteria
Using prescription fill data, we identified 11,469 patients
initiating DAA treatment between January 1, 2014, and
June 30, 2015. Those with known SVR status and weight data
before and after SVR determination were included in analysis.
The observation period for weight change occurred from the
time of SVR determination until 2 years after (Fig. 1). SVR
achievement was defined as having a negative hepatitis C
polymerase chain reaction viral load at least 11 weeks after
DAA treatment completion to allow for a 1-week buffer for
those receiving early testing before clinic follow-up, expected
at 12 weeks after DAA completion.
Body Weight, Weight Change, and Weight
Class
Body weight was obtained at three time points: (1) DAA
initiation using the closest measure in the prior 90 days; (2)
SVR determination using the closest weight in the following
90 days; and (3) follow-up, 2 years after SVR determination.
Follow-up weight was defined as (a) the closest weight within
30 days of the 2-year time point or average if two equidistant
values, (b) if not available, then the closest value within
90 days, or (c) if not available, then the interpolation of the
two closest weight values within 180 days. The observation
time period was chosen to exclude the treatment time period to
exclude the possibility of DAA-induced weight changes and
before SVR determination since unknown treatment outcome
was an exclusion criterion. We calculated the weight change in
the time period from treatment initiation to SVR determination
and found no large mean weight change (− 0.1 ± 11.7 lbs),
though noted 1468 (12.8%) of patients gained ≥ 10 lbs.
Weight change was defined as the difference between
weights at SVR determination and at 2-year follow-up. The
primary outcome, excess weight gain, was defined as weight
change ≥ 10 lbs over the 2-year observation period, chosen to
be clinically practical while also beyond the degree of weight
gain expected with aging (1 to 2 lbs per year).26
Weight class was defined using height and weight to calculate the body mass index (BMI), categorized using standard
cutoffs (underweight < 18.5 kg/m2
; normal 18.5 to < 25; overweight 25 to < 30; class 1 obesity 30 to < 35; class 2 obesity 35
to < 40; and class 3 obesity ≥ 40).27 Height was defined as the
average between measures at SVR determination and at follow-up. Class 2 and 3 obesity groups were combined due to
small sample sizes.
Covariates at DAA Initiation
Covariates obtained at the time of DAA initiation, chosen a
priori, included age, sex, and race (White, Black, or other),
DAA regimen (classified as sofosbuvir-based or nonsofosbuvir), pre-treatment viral load (log-transformed), viral
genotype (1, 2, 3, or 4–6/multiple), Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) (categorized as < 1.45, 1.45–3.25, and > 3.25),28 renal glomerular
filtration rate (GFR, in mL/min/1.73 m2
),29 Alcohol Use Disorders Identifications Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C) scores,
and smoking status (current, former, or never smoker). International Classification of Diseases, 9th modification (ICD-9),
diagnosis codes (with 2 outpatient codes or 1 inpatient code)
were used to define cirrhosis, depression or severe mental
illness (depression, major depressive disorder, post-traumatic
stress disorder, schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder), diabetes,

illicit drug use, and alcohol use disorder. Smoking status was
defined using health factors (current, former, or never
smoker).
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics including graphical assessment of weight
at DAA initiation, SVR determination, follow-up, and weight
change were used to assess weight distributions overall and
across SVR determination groups. Across these same groups,
we also compared average differences in weight change. Significance of differences in proportions and continuous variables were tested with chi-square tests and t tests, respectively.
Univariate and multiple logistic regression models were performed to identify important predictors of weight gain from
the list of a priori covariates. We used a full-model approach,
and then restricted only to patients achieving SVR and used
the strongest predictors to estimate the probability of excess
weight gain based on patient clinical characteristics. We conducted sensitivity analyses to assess the effect of heterogeneity, by excluding patients with extreme weight changes (< 1st
and > 99th percentile) and those not achieving SVR. To account for potential bias introduced by missing data, we performed multiple imputation using 10 imputed datasets produced by fully conditional specification method on missing
covariate data (range of missing data 0 to 5.4% for all variables).30 Statistical significance for all tests was defined with a
two-tailed p value of < 0.05. Institutional review board approval for this study was obtained from both the VA Connecticut Healthcare System, West Haven, and from Yale University School of Medicine. All data analyses were performed
with SAS 9.4 statistical software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary,
NC, USA).
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
The analytic dataset contained 11,496 patients, with complete
covariate data available in 10,596 patients (92.4% of eligible
sample). It was comprised of 96.4% males, 59.9% White race,
85.2% genotype 1 infection, 37.9% with elevated FIB-4 score
> 3.25, and 38.5% patients with cirrhosis by diagnosis code.
SVR was achieved in 97.0% of patients. At the time of
treatment initiation, 78.1% of patients were overweight or obese,
including 41.3% overweight (BMI 25–29.9) and 36.8% obese
(BMI 30 or higher). Those with weight gain ≥ 10 lbs were more
likely to have achieved SVR (97.7% vs. 96.8%) and to have FIB4 score > 3.25 (43.4% vs. 37.2%), cirrhosis (43.4% vs. 37.2%),
and obesity class 1 (25.8% vs. 24.3%) or class 2/3 (15.1% vs.
11.4%, p < 0.05 for all), but did not differ in other comorbidities
(Table 1). Those with and without SVR were similar regarding
age, gender, race, DAA regimen, renal function, diabetes, alcohol
use, and mental illness. However, those not achieving SVR had
higher rates of genotype 2 and 3 infection (15.6% vs. 8.7% for
genotype 2; 16.2% vs. 4.5% for genotype 3), FIB-4 score > 3.25
(48.4% vs. 37.6%), cirrhosis (46.4% vs. 38.3%), HCC (12.5%
vs. 3.8%), and obesity at treatment initiation (44.4% vs. 35.6%),
drug use (49.3% vs. 41.9%), and current smoking (65.4% vs.
57.6%, p < 0.05 for all).
Body Weight Change
Overall, the weight change over 2 years was (mean ± standard
deviation) 0.44 ± 12.9 lbs. The mean weight change was 0.56
± 12.8 lbs in those achieving SVR and − 3.43 ± 14.6 lbs in
those without SVR (p < 0.0001). Over the 2-year observation
period, 6027 (52.6%) patients gained weight; this was more
common in those achieving SVR compared with no SVR
(52.9% vs. 40.9%, p < 0.0001). Overall, 2275 patients
(19.8%) gained ≥ 10 lbs; again, more common in those achieving SVR compared with those not achieving SVR (21.5% vs.
16.2%, p = 0.01). On graphical assessment and assessment of
weight change percentiles (Fig. 2), those achieving SVR had
more weight gain or less weight loss across all percentiles of
weight change. With SVR, the weight gain was as high as
38.2 lbs for those in the top percentile, with 10% of patients
gaining at least 16.5 lbs.
In those with normal BMI at treatment initiation, 22% became
overweight during follow-up (Fig. 3). Among those who were
obese at treatment initiation, very few patients (1%) normalized
their BMI at 2 years, but many patients progressed to higher BMI
classes. Of those overweight, 16% became obese. Of those with
class 1 obesity, 14% progressed to class 2/3 obesity.
Multivariable Models for Excess Weight Gain
In the all-inclusive multiple logistic regression model (Table 2),
factors associated with excess weight gain included SVR

achievement (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.14, 2.10), FIB-4 score > 3.25
(OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.06, 1.44), and cirrhosis (OR 1.20, 95% CI
1.08, 1.34). Additionally, we observed a dose-effect relationship
with BMI class at DAA treatment initiation: overweight, obesity
class 1, and obesity class 2/3 were associated with significant and
increasing odds of excess weight gain (OR 1.17, 1.25, and 1.50,
respectively). Factors associated with lower odds of excess
weight gain included older age ≥ 65 years (OR 0.70, 95% CI
0.57, 0.85) and no alcohol use compared with moderate use (OR
0.80, 95% CI 0.69, 0.94).
Sensitivity Analyses
A missing covariate data was present in 873 (7.6%) of
the 11,469 study-eligible patients. Analyses using multiple imputation models (Supplemental Table 1), and excluding patients with extreme weight changes (n = 229)
(not shown) or without SVR achievement (n = 322) (not
shown), revealed the same predictors of excess weight
gain observed in the primary model. In the assessment
of the clinical characteristics of those with missing data
(Supplemental Table 2), there were notably more

excluded White patients, as well as fewer with cirrhosis,
diabetes, substance use, or mental health disorders.
Probability Estimates for Weight Gain
The four most influential variables were age (< 65 vs. ≥
65 years), cirrhosis (diagnosis code or FIB-4 > 3.25), BMI
class at treatment initiation (combining under- and normal
weight), and alcohol use (combining hazardous use and alcohol use disorder). To aid in clinical decision-making and better
illustrate their impact, we estimated probability of weight gain
> 10 lbs employing only these variables in a logistic regression. The estimated probability of excess weight gain ranged
from 12.7 to 34.1%, with the highest probability observed in
younger patients, with cirrhosis, class 2/3 obesity, and moderate alcohol use; and the lowest probability in under/normal
weight, older patients, without cirrhosis, and no alcohol use
(Table 3).
DISCUSSION
In this nationally representative, prospective study of 11,469
veterans treated for HCV with DAA, we found that despite
78.1% of patients already being overweight or obese at treatment initiation, over half of patients gained weight and nearly
20% gained ≥ 10 lbs after 2 years. The highest risk for excess
weight gain was observed younger patients with cirrhosis,
obesity, and moderate alcohol consumption. Dependent on
important clinical characteristics (age, presence of cirrhosis,
weight at treatment initiation, and alcohol use habits), patients
can expect from 1 in 5 to a 1 in 3 chance of excess weight gain
after 2 years. Over the observation period of this study, most
patients gained weight; only a small minority decreased or
normalized weight.
Several mechanisms may explain weight gain after SVR,
including removal of chronic inflammation or infectious burden, increased nutritional intake, and improved hepatic anabolic function. Chronic systemic infection or inflammation are
processes which may lead to metabolic diseases such as diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia.31, 32 These processes may
lead to excess metabolic burden, suppressing weight gain that
might otherwise have occurred. In this setting, SVR achievement might result in weight gain in the absence of lifestyle
changes to promote weight loss. This may also explain our
finding of failed SVR associated with weight loss, which may
be due to ongoing chronic infection, metabolic burden, and
progressive hepatic fibrosis with cirrhosis.
Increased energy intake may be another explanation for
weight gain after SVR. HCV is known to lead to reduced
quality of life, depression, and fatigue,33, 34 all of which may
lead to reduced intake and resultant weight loss. Additionally,
advanced liver disease is associated with protein-calorie malnutrition and sarcopenia, which might also lead to weight
loss.35 HCV cure may result in improvement in well-being
or changes in hunger-inducing hormones, which can result in
increased nutritional intake and therefore weight gain.
Reduced hepatic anabolic function in advanced fibrosis and
cirrhosis has been associated with a reduced skeletal muscle
mass.36, 37 HCV without cirrhosis has also been associated
with reduced muscle mass.38, 39 Thus, HCV cure may improve
liver synthetic function and increase skeletal muscle mass
production. In this study, we found that both advanced fibrosis
and cirrhosis are associated with excess weight gain after

DAA treatment, which may correlate with improved hepatic
synthetic function from SVR.
However, with age, decreases in skeletal muscle and bone
mass have been observed, with concurrent increases in fat
mass.40 This may suggest that the observed weight gain in
this middle-aged population might be from fat accumulation.
Our finding of older age associated with lower odds of weight
gain may also be explained by age-related reduction in skeletal
and muscle mass. Future studies are needed to better characterize the metabolic risk associated with weight gain in this
population.
Most importantly, weight gain in a cohort with 78.1%
baseline prevalence of overweight or obesity raises concern
for increased risk of obesity-related disease. It is concerning
that 16% of overweight patients became obese at 2 years, and
14% of class 1 obesity patients at baseline progressed to class
2 or 3 obesity at 2 years. Further, fewer than 1% of patients
with obesity at baseline normalized weight during the 2 years
of observation. We found an increased odds of excess weight
gain in those with the highest baseline weight. This is
concerning as those already at risk for obesity complications
are at higher risk for excess weight gain. All patients in this
study are already middle-aged at the time of DAA initiation.
Thus, it is possible that the long-engrained lifestyle habits
which led some to higher weights by the time of treatment
initiation could contribute to even more weight gain after
DAA treatment.
Although we defined a 10-lb weight gain as clinically
important in this study, smaller magnitudes of weight gain
can still pose health risks. For example, for those with human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, every 5 pounds
gained has been associated with a 14% increased risk of
incident diabetes in just the first year after antiretroviral therapy initiation.41 Conversely, a modest weight loss of 5% body
weight is known to improve insulin resistance, blood pressure,
dyslipidemia, and risk of cardiovascular or NAFLD-related
steatohepatitis.42–44 Thus, although a 10-lb threshold is important, any weight gain may be associated with harm.
The AASLD recommends counseling on weight gain
avoidance in all who achieve SVR.4 However, it is currently
unclear who stands to benefit most from these measures, or
whether counseling is sufficient to prevent weight gain. Our
findings suggest that DAA treatment is an opportune time to
discuss post-SVR management and to frame the importance of
weight in long-term metabolic risk and associated liver and
non-liver outcomes. Although prevention of weight gain can
be advised as currently recommended, it should be considered
a minimum measure, and active weight loss is necessary for
most patients who already are overweight or obese.
Another recommendation based on our results is stricter
alcohol reduction or even abstinence. We found that moderate
alcohol use predicted a higher odds of weight gain. Alcohol is
both an appetite stimulant and a carbohydrate load, resulting in
positive energy balance when consumed in moderate quantities.45 However, with excess use, it is also known to cause
multiple complications including protein-calorie and micronutrient malnutrition, sarcopenia, and chronic liver disease.46 In
this sample, those with moderate alcohol use likely consume
enough to obtain positive energy balance without suffering
other complications leading to weight loss. Thus, those
achieving SVR may be at risk for excess weight with moderate
alcohol use (in addition to any potential direct liver injury from
alcohol) and may benefit from alcohol abstinence to prevent
further weight gain.
The economic burden of end-stage liver disease is immense,
with direct costs estimated to be $2.5 billion and indirect costs
as much as $10.6 billion.47 Prevention of liver disease progression through treatment of excess weight and prevention of
weight gain holds potential to reduce healthcare burden, decrease extrahepatic complications of HCV, and increase

quality of life in patients after DAA treatment.14 Beyond liver
disease, the healthcare costs associated with obesity are immense, estimated to be $150 billion per year in the U.S..48 This
underscores the importance of identifying weight gain in this
population since worsening obesity would be expected to
reduce any healthcare cost-savings obtained through successful HCV cure.
Finally, we developed a simplified model of predictors of
post-SVR weight gain to estimate the predicted probabilities
of excess weight gain. Although the majority of patients have
a high probability of gaining weight, with these results
(Table 3), clinicians may identify those at the highest risk for
excess weight gain at the time of DAA initiation. For example,
a 55-year-old patient with moderate alcohol use who has
cirrhosis and class 2 obesity at treatment initiation would be
expected on average to have a 34.1% probability (95% CI
29.9%, 38.4%) of gaining at least 10 lbs in 2 years. The use of
a risk stratification tool may allow clinicians to identify patients for whom focused counseling, interventions, and resources for weight loss can be prioritized. Using a
probability-based tool may allow policymakers and clinicians
to establish benchmarking criteria to systematically identify
and assess patients for obesity risk factors after completion of
HCV treatment, though further research is needed to identify
predictors and to consolidate those factors in to a simple and
effective tool.

JGIM Do et al.: Post-SVR Weight Gain After DAA for HCV 2031

This study aimed to describe weight change in this sample
of patients, rather than make comparisons with alternative
groups. The rationale for this approach is due to concern for
validity of such comparisons. Comparing with those with
chronic HCV not receiving DAA therapies, there is a concern
for confounding by factors leading to decision not to treat,
such as comorbid substance abuse, decompensated cirrhosis,
or other coinfections. Comparing those achieving SVR with
non-SVR, other factors may be confounding such as drug
adherence, prior undiagnosed cirrhosis, and comorbidity. In
consideration of comparison with an uninfected veteran sample, we observe an obesity prevalence of 37.7% in our sample,
in contrast to 41% in the general veteran population, suggesting our sample is distinct.15, 49 Additionally, our rationale for
defining excess weight gain as > 10 lbs in 2 years is that it is
distinct from age-related weight gain, which occurs at a rate of
1 to 2 lbs per year.50, 51
Our study benefits from several strengths. To the best of our
knowledge, this study is the largest known analysis to date to
assess post-SVR weight gain with the longest period of follow-up. Our findings are also strengthened by the utilization of
a large, nationally derived, individual-level, longitudinal database with directly measured weights, prescription, and laboratory data. Additionally, the persistence of regression modeling findings in sensitivity analyses and after covariate adjustment strengthens the validity of our results. These findings of
weight gain after SVR are not alternatively due to DAA
medication effect as weight change was defined by a period
starting approximately 3 months after treatment was already
completed.
However, our study has several limitations. We were unable
to differentiate the type of weight gain observed (skeletal,
muscular, or adipose tissue), which would be possible with
bioelectrical impedance or imaging-based tests. Further, a
two-year observation period may be too short to observe a
significant loss of non-fat mass, and this study did not include
body composition data. The 2-year follow-up duration is the
longest follow-up period for a study investigating weight gain
after SVR, but weight changes may follow a different trajectory after 2 years. Longer follow-up will be particularly relevant given increasing HCV disease burden affecting younger
patients undergoing treatment earlier in life.52 It will also
provide the opportunity to measure the impact post-SVR
weight gain has on the incidence of comorbidities such as
diabetes, HCC, and NAFLD. The difference observed in those
achieving SVR compared with those without SVR suggests
that HCV cure modifies the natural history of weight gain.
However, patients not achieving SVR are likely to be clinically different from those with SVR in other ways besides body
weight, which limits comparability between these groups and
forms our basis for not using a comparison group. We emphasize that this study is primarily investigating weight change
after SVR attainment and factors associated with excess
weight gain. While we did not exclude patients failing to
achieve SVR, we also found no difference in sensitivity analysis excluding this subgroup. To enhance the argument for or

against causality in future studies, utilization of advanced
analytic methods such as propensity score matching or
interrupted time series design can be considered. Finally, this
sample of primarily male veterans may limit the generalizability of these findings to the U.S. population, and studies including women and non-veteran civilians are warranted.
Confirmatory studies of these predictors of weight gain and
investigation of other potential factors would better allow identification of those at high risk for weight gain and of new predictors
of weight gain after SVR. This could allow us to focus healthcare
resources on those who would stand to benefit the most. Linking
weight gain to liver and metabolic diseases such as NAFLD,
cirrhosis, HCC, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular diseases
would facilitate development of clinical prediction tools these
diseases. Further study of special populations will be important,
such as those receiving liver transplantation, for whom weight
gain and graft steatosis have been reported.53, 54 Also, further
elucidation of mechanisms resulting in weight gain after HCV
cure may inform specific targets for intervention.
CONCLUSION
We report weight gain in a large proportion of patients after DAA
treatment in a large, nationwide, cohort of 11,469 U.S. veterans
with chronic HCV infection. In this prospective sample, we
observed that 78% were overweight or obese at the time of
DAA initiation, and over 20% of patients achieving SVR gained
excess weight of at least 10 lbs over 2 years. Weight gain was
more commonly observed with younger age, baseline overweight
or obesity, cirrhosis, and moderate alcohol use. Future studies are
needed to clarify the long-term implications and both liver and
non-liver outcomes associated with weight gain in the post-SVR
context, as well as the role of clinical interventions to prevent
weight gain after DAA treatment.
