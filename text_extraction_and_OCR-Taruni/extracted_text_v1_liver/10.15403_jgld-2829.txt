INTRODUCTION
Liver transplantation (LT) 
is a well-established therapy 
for patients with end-stage 
chronic liver disease and acute 
fulminant hepatitis. Initially, 
LT was a high-risk procedure, 
with extensive mortality. 
However, with surgical technical 
advances, introduction of 
ne w immunosuppressive 
regimens, and improvements 
in the hospital care of patients, 
survival after transplantation 
has increased significantly [1-3]. 
Several contemporary studies 
have reported 90% survival after 
1 year of LT, 75% after 5 years 
and 70% after 10 years [3, 4].

ABSTRACT
Aim: This study goal was to evaluate the long-term quality of life of patients who underwent cadaveric liver 
transplants (CLT) in two Brazilian hospitals. 
Methods: Medical records of all patients who underwent CLT and survived over 10 years were revised. The 
international validated questionnaire Short-Form 36 was employed to assess the quality of life. Patients data 
were obtained from electronic medical records and study protocols. 
Results: A total of 342 patients underwent CLT, of which 129 were alive and 93 fully answered the questionnaire 
and were included in the study. The group consisted of 62 men (66.6%) and 31 women (33.4%), with average 
age of 40.1±15.9 years. Follow-up time was 16±4.1 years. The most common indication of CLT was hepatic 
cirrhosis caused by hepatitis C virus, 24.7%. Transplanted patients had lower scores than the general population 
in mental health [62.9 (95%CI: 60.1-65.7,) vs. 74.5, p < 0.001]. In all other domains, transplanted patients had 
similar (emotional aspect limitiation, pain, and general health status) or superior (physical aspect limitation, 
social aspects, functional capacity, and vitality) scores than the general population. Functional capacity score 
was lower in patients with long-term complications, who were aged more than 50-years, and unemployed. 
Conclusions: The quality of life in patients with more than 10 years after CLT was similar or superior than 
the general population, except for the mental health domain.
Key words: liver transplantation − quality of life − liver cirrhosis.

With the significant improvement in survival of patients 
undergoing LT, several authors have begun to focus attention 
on quality of life (QOL) after LT [2, 3, 5, 6]. Complete recovery 
from the procedure may take several months due to pre-LT 
debilitated general status and the frequent occurrence of 
significant complications following LT. Some patients may 
have recurrence of their primary disease, such as viral hepatitis, 
immunological diseases, and hepatocellular carcinoma. 
In addition, all liver transplant recipients require lifelong 
treatment with immunosuppressive agents and regular followup to detect and treat long-term complications.
Several studies have evaluated the various aspects of QOL 
after LT, such as growth and development, return to school 
and work, sex life and hormonal changes [3, 6]. However, in 
Latin America, most of these evaluations are limited to patients 
undergoing LT in the short term [7-9]. To the best of our 
knowledge there are no Latin America studies that assessed 
the long-term QOL of patients who underwent LT. 
The aim of the present study was to evaluate the QOL of 
patients who underwent cadaveric liver transplants (CLT)

after 10 years of transplantation at the Clinical Hospital of 
the Federal University of Paraná and at the Nossa Senhora 
das Graças Hospital Curitiba, Brazil, and to identify potential 
factors that might be associated with impaired QOL.
METHODS
Medical records of all patients with more than 10 years LT 
performed at the University Hospital of the Federal University 
of Paraná and Nossa Senhora das Graças Hospital, Curitiba, 
Brazil, by the same transplantation team, were retrospectively 
evaluated.
Data regarding patient demographics, diagnosis, ChildPugh classification, peri-transplant clinical factors, transplant 
technique, graft function and complications were obtained 
from electronic medical records and study protocols. Before 
May 2006, when Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) 
was officially introduced in Brazil, this score was retrospectively 
calculated based on the exams performed on the day of the 
transplantation. Liver transplantation was performed using 
standard surgical techniques. After LT, patients were placed on 
standard immunosuppressive protocol consisting of tacrolimus 
or cyclosporine, azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil, and 
prednisone.
Subjective QOL was assessed through Short-Form 36 (SF36), a generic, self-rated health survey designed to compare 
health status across diverse populations. This questionnaire is an 
internationally accepted general QOL survey validated by several 
authors, included for application in Brazilian population [10, 11] 
and is the most commonly used generic questionnaire [12]. It 
offers broad-spectrum questions applicable to a variety of patient 
groups and enables comparison between different populations. 
The questionnaire includes 36 questions divided into 8 
subscales on general health, physical functioning, physical 
role functioning, bodily pain, mental health, emotional role 
functioning, social functioning, and vitality, as well as aggregate 
scores for physical and mental health. For each question, a 
score was attributed. Calculation was performed according 
to the SF-36 questionnaire protocol, composed by the data 
weighting phase and raw scale calculation phase 2, with scores 
ranging from 0 to 100. 
All patients who underwent LT in our Hospitals before 
December 31, 2008, known to be alive and whom we had 
a telephone number or an e-mail address were contacted. 
The study was duly explained to the patients. A letter with 
explanations, the SF-36 questionnaire, and the consent form 
to participate of this study were given personally or sent to 
the patients by e-mail. A few patients preferred to answer the 
questionnaire by phone or completed the questionnaire during 
routine medical consultation. Strict confidentiality was assured, 
and it was made clear that the transplant members would not 
have access to answers from any individual patient.
Values were expressed as average with standard deviation 
(average±SD), median (minim-maxim values) and others with 
95% confidence interval (95%CI). To evaluate the QOL in 
relation to the age at the transplant day, the gender, employment 
and late complications, the Mann-Whitney nonparametric test 
was applied. To analyze the QOL of the patients in relation to 
the average of the general population and the population of 
the South of Brazil, the student t test for a sample was used, 
comparing the averages of each SF-36 domain for the analyzed 
population [10, 11]. Results with p value <0.05 were considered 
as statistically significant. The statistical software SPSS 22.0 was 
employed to organize the charts and analyze the data.
The protocol of this study was approved by the Research 
Committee of the University Hospital of the Federal University 
of Paraná, Brazil (CAAE 91362818.7.0000.0096).
RESULTS
A total of 420 patients underwent 440 LTs in the period 
of September of 1991 through December of 2008. There were 
342 patients who underwent CLT and 78 patients who were 
subjected to living donor LT. Of the patients who underwent 
CLT, 129 (37.7%) were alive on December 31, 2018 (Fig. 1). In 
addition to the patients who were subjected to living donor LT 
and the ones who died, we excluded from the study patients 
who had no follow-up in our hospital (n= 29), who opted not 
to participate in the research or did not answer all the questions 
(n=5) and who had incomplete medical records (n=2). The 
remaining 93 patients were subjected to the study.

number of those who were alive until 2018 and have participated in 
the study.
Clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the 93 
patients who have participated in the study are shown in Table 
I. There were 62 men (66.6%). The average age was 40.1±15.9 
years (9-66) at the time of transplantation, with average body 
mass index (BMI) of 24.5±4.5 Kg/m² (14.3-40.1 Kg/m²) for 
n=86. At the time of the study the average age was 56±15.1 years 
(24-82). The average follow-up time was 16±4.1 years (10-25). 
Child-Pugh classification and MELD score were used to 
determine the severity of the liver disease. MELD ranged from 
9 to 40 points (n=74), with an average of 16.9±5.1 and median 
of 16 points (Table I). For this purpose, additional points were 
not added to the MELD score of patients with associated 
hepatocellular carcinoma. Of the 83 patients who had the 
classification of Child-Pugh available in the medical records, 
14 (17%) were class A, 49 (59%) class B and 20 (24%) class C.

Long-term quality of life after a liver transplant 613
J Gastrointestin Liver Dis, December 2020 Vol. 29 No 4: 611-616 
The most common indications for cadaveric liver 
transplantation (CLT) were liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis C 
virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV), representing 24.7% 
and 18.3% of causes, respectively. The remaining indications 
are listed in Table I. All patients with alcoholic cirrhosis had 
abstained from alcohol for at least 6 months prior to LT. 
Early postoperative complications occurred within 30 days 
of CLT or until patient discharge and were observed in 52 
patients (66%). Acute liver rejection was the main complication 
(34.6%) and pulse therapy was used as treatment in 88.8% of 
the cases (16 out of 18 patients). 
Late postoperative complications were defined as any 
complication that occurred from the 30th postoperative day 
until the day of the last evaluation for data collection for the 
present manuscript. Seventy patients (75.3%) had one or 
more complications. Of 23 patients with HCV hepatitis who 
underwent LT, 18 had viral recurrence (78%). Only 6 patients 
with HCV recurrence were treated with ribavirin. 
Late complications were divided into four categories: 
cardiovascular and renal diseases (n=35; e.g., arterial 
hypertension, renal dysfunction), hepatitis C virus recurrence 
(n=18), biliary duct stricture and other complications (n=22; 
e.g., rejection, abdominal hernia, lymphoma). Five patients 
developed de novo malignancy after LT, three posttransplant 
lymphoproliferative diseases, 1 prostate carcinoma, and 1 skin 
cancer. All patients responded well to treatment, with no tumor 
recurrence. No hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence or de 
novo was recorded in the present study, which included only 
patients who survived more than 10 years after LT. Twentythree patients (24.7%) had no late complications. Patients 
with late complications needed more posttransplant hospital 
readmissions than patients without late complications (4.2±0.5 
vs. 1.3±0.1; p=0.01).
Retransplantation was performed in 5 patients (5.4%) 
due to chronic rejection (n=3) and hepatic artery thrombosis 
(n=2). The surgery was performed 2.9±3.5 years after the 
initial transplant. One patient needed a third transplant, 
performed three days after the second, due to hepatic artery 
thrombosis.
In comparison with data obtained from the general Brazilian 
population constituted of 12,423 randomly selected Brazilian 
men and women aged 18 years old or more from urban and 
rural areas of all five Brazilian regions who completed the SF36 questionnaire (Social Dimensions of Inequalities Study), 
our study showed some important findings. The data were 
expressed as average with 95%CI in transplanted patients vs. 
average of general Brazilian population. Transplanted patients 
had lower scores than the general population in mental health 
[62.9 (95%CI: 60.1-65.7,) vs. 74.5, p<0.001]. In all other 
domains, transplanted patients had similar (emotional aspects, 
pain, and general health status) or superior (physical aspects, 
social aspects, functional capacity and vitality) scores than the 
general population (Table II).
When compared with the population of the south Brazilian 
region, transplanted patients had also lower scores in mental 
health [62.9 (95%CI: 60.1-65.7) vs. 73.8, p<0.001] (Table II). In 
all other domains, transplanted patients had a better quality of 
life, except in the general health status [69.3 (95%CI: 65.8-73) 
vs. 71.1, p=0.307], in which there was no difference between 
the two groups.
Transplanted patients were also divided into groups 
and quality of life compared according to age, gender, and 
posttransplant employment (Table III) and occurrence of 
late complications (Table IV). These data were expressed 
in average±SD. Functional capacity score was better in 
transplanted patients with ≤50 years years of age than in 
patients with >50 years (92.8±10.8 vs. 83.4±23.7, p=0.026) 
and in employed than in non-employed (94.9±9.3 vs. 85±20, 
p=0.01) (Table III). The social aspects score was lower for 
females than males (84.7±18.4 vs. 91.1±19.8, p=0.018) (Table 
III). 
Late complications showed a significant association 
with some aspects of quality of life. Functional capacity 
was worse in patients that had cardiovascular and/or renal 
complications and HCV recurrence than in patients who had 
no complications (Table IV).

DISCUSSION
There is a dearth of data on long-term survival and QOL 
after LT in Latin America. The few publications on this subject 
is limited to patients with follow-up less than 5 years after LT 
[7-9]. The present study includes patients who were subjected 
to CLT with at least 10-year survival. Our 37.7% survival for 
patients with more than 10 years after CLT is lower than that 
of most American and European institutions. Our average 
follow-up time was 16 years. 
Presently, 10-year survival rate of patients subjected to LT 
in the United States and Europe is 50 to 60% [2, 3, 5, 6, 12, 13]. 
This difference is possibly due to several medical limitations 
of developing countries, such as Brazil, mainly shortage of 
appropriate hospital resources and patients´ economic and 
cultural differences.
The outcome of LT has improved dramatically over the past 
two decades in terms of reducing the morbidity and mortality. 
It is also of paramount importance to determine whether the 
LT is able to restore the QOL [4, 13]. Several studies have 
evaluated the various aspects of QOL after LT, such as growth 
and development, return to school and work, sex life and 
hormonal changes, both in short-term and long-term after 
the transplant [3, 14-19]. These studies have documented a 
significant QOL improvement, with most patients returning 
to normal life. 

Long-term quality of life after a liver transplant 615
J Gastrointestin Liver Dis, December 2020 Vol. 29 No 4: 611-616 
Several studies demonstrated that QOL improves and 
remains stable over the years after transplantation but does 
not reach the level of the general population in one domain, 
namely physical activity [1-3, 5, 12]. This may be due to the 
presence of comorbidities, side-effects of immunosuppressors, 
and recurrence of liver disease in some patients.
There is, however, little information on the long-term QOL 
in patients after LT in Latin America [7-9, 14-16]. Long-term 
follow-up for LT has been defined as at least 5 years duration 
based on average, median or final recorded time of follow-up 
[3]. Our report presents the findings of a single-transplant 
team study of QOL in patients with more than 10 years after 
successful LT.
The World Health Organization Committee for QOL defined 
that QOL is a “multidimensional construct that is affected by 
physical health, psychological health, functional status, social 
relationships, personal beliefs” [20]. The method of QOL 
evaluation used in our study was the SF-36, which has been 
validated in several countries, including in Brazil. This QOL 
questionnaire was developed by Ware and Sherbourne [10] in 
the English language and translated and validated in Brazil by 
Ciconelli et al. [11] in 1999. It assesses 8 domains on general 
health, functional capacity, physical aspects, bodily pain, mental 
health, emotional aspects, social functioning, and vitality.
Our study showed that mental health was the only QOL 
domain lower in CLT patients than the general Brazilian 
population [21] or the population of the southern region of 
the country [22]. In all other QOL domains, CLT had similar 
or superior scores than the general or southern population 
of Brazil. A possible explanation for mental health status to 
be the only QOL domain that was reduced in our study may 
be related to the distress and fear reported by our patients of 
depending exclusively on the Federal Brazilian Government 
to obtain expensive medications (e.g. immunosuppressants, 
antivirals), and to perform surgical procedures to treat 
potential complications for the rest of their lives. Other authors 
have also reported lower mental health scores following LT, 
possibly due to fear of losing disability or Medicaid benefits, 
adverse effects of medications, recurrence of liver disease, and 
other potential complications [23, 24].
Several studies demonstrated that the socioeconomic status, 
such as marital status, education level, social support, income, 
profession, and employment are crucial factors that influence 
QOL after LT [3, 12, 25]. Since Brazil is a large country with 
enormous socioeconomic and cultural differences between 
the Brazilian regions, we considered that it was important to 
compare QOL of the CLT patients not only with that of the 
general population, but also with that of the south Brazilian 
region, where our hospitals are located. Another important 
aspect that should be considered is the gratitude that most 
patients have for the success of the transplant. This may have 
contributed to a positive result in QOL of our study.
Contrary to our findings, the studies from the transplant 
centers at the University of California, USA and at the 
University of Cambridge, England, showed no mental 
health domain difference between transplanted patients and 
the general population [1, 5]. These two studies have also 
demonstrated that physical aspects domain was inferior in 
transplanted patients. Our study as well as that of Drent et al. 
[26] showed no reduction in physical aspects in transplanted 
patients. The QOL evaluation is difficult and conflicting 
results may be due to different questionnaires employed and 
distinct patients’ expectation. QOL of some patients is already 
diminished prior to the LT due to the physical, emotional, and 
social limitations imposed by the liver disease. Therefore, it is 
not surprising that many patients may compare positively their 
present QOL with the one they had before the LT.
Similar to our findings, several studies demonstrated no 
reduction in other QOL domains assessed (general health, 
physical aspects, bodily pain, emotional aspects, social aspects 
and vitality) in transplanted patients as compared to the general 
population [1, 5, 12].
Social factors, such as marital status, family support, and 
employment are important factors to improve QOL following 
LT [12, 28]. These factors help to restore the functional role 
of the patients in society. Similar to Desai et al. [1] and Zahn 
et al. [27], we observed that the functional capacity score was 
better in LT recipients with ≤50 years of age and in patients 
employed after the transplant. We also recorded that the social 
aspect score was lower in females than in males . 
Presence of long-term complications following LT, such 
as HCV recurrence, cardiovascular complications, and renal 
complication, may impact QOL of LT recipients [12, 28]. Most 
patients with these severe complications may need repeated 
hospital readmissions for evaluation and treatment. In addition 
to the physical suffering, these patients may experience 
anxiety, stress, depression, and expectation reduction. These 
important changes may contribute to QOL reduction. As 
previously demonstrated by other authors, the present study 
showed a reduced functional capacity in patients with these 
late complications [12, 23, 24, 28]. 
Mental health domain reduction observed in our 
transplanted patients is an important finding. Transplanted 
patients should have routine mental health evaluation 
and therapeutic measures instituted when mental health 
changes are recognized. A multidisciplinary approach with 
psychological treatment and social intervention may be helpful 
for rehabilitating these patients.
The major strength of our study is the large number 
of patients with more than 10 years of survival after liver 
transplantation. In addition, the percentage of living patients 
who have participated in the study is high. 
The major limitation of our study is the retrospective 
evaluation of the data of our patients. This is minimized 
because all medical and surgical procedures were coordinated 
and supervised by the same transplant team and the data were 
retrieved from electronic medical records and study protocols.
CONCLUSIONS
In our study QOL in patients with more than 10 years after 
LT is similar or superior than in the general population, except 
for the mental health domain which is inferior.
