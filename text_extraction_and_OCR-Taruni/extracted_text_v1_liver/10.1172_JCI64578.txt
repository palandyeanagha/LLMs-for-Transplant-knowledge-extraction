The prevention and treatment of acute chest syndrome (ACS) is a major clinical concern in sickle cell disease 
(SCD). However, the mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of ACS remains elusive. We tested the hypothesis that the hemolysis byproduct hemin elicits events that induce ACS. Infusion of a low dose of hemin caused 
acute intravascular hemolysis and autoamplification of extracellular hemin in transgenic sickle mice, but 
not in sickle-trait littermates. The sickle mice developed multiple symptoms typical of ACS and succumbed 
rapidly. Pharmacologic inhibition of TLR4 and hemopexin replacement therapy prior to hemin infusion 
protected sickle mice from developing ACS. Replication of the ACS-like phenotype in nonsickle mice revealed 
that the mechanism of lung injury due to extracellular hemin is independent of SCD. Using genetic and bone 
marrow chimeric tools, we confirmed that TLR4 expressed in nonhematopoietic vascular tissues mediated 
this lethal type of acute lung injury. Respiratory failure was averted after the onset of ACS-like symptoms 
in sickle mice by treating them with recombinant hemopexin. Our results reveal a mechanism that helps to 
explain the pathogenesis of ACS, and we provide proof of principle for therapeutic strategies to prevent and 
treat this condition in mice.
Introduction
Sickle cell disease (SCD) affects an estimated 100,000 people in the 
United States and millions more around the world (1). Acute chest 
syndrome (ACS) is the second most common reason for hospital 
admission of SCD patients (2) and the leading cause of referral to 
intensive care units (3), and it is associated with a high mortality rate 
(4). ACS diagnosis is associated with decreasing hemoglobin (Hb) 
concentration, hypoxemia, and multilobular lung infiltration (5). 
Lung injury in ACS is characterized predominantly by edema formation (6). Because the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved 
are unknown, management of this condition is entirely supportive.
Antecedent clinical events associated with ACS development 
include intravascular sickling (7), fat emboli, hypoxia (8), microvascular in situ thrombosis (8), infection (9), and acute painful 
vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) (5). There have been attempts to model 
ACS in transgenic sickle mice using endotoxin (10), severe hypoxia 
(11), progressive hypoxia (12), and hypoxia/reoxygenation (13, 14). 
To date, no preclinical ACS model has been successfully established, which poses a major barrier to progress in the management 
of this condition. In addition, ACS diagnosis is a major challenge, 
as evidenced by the failure to find a specific etiological factor 
in nearly 50% of cases in the study by the National Acute Chest 
Syndrome Study Group (5). Regardless of the initial symptoms, 
however, most SCD patients experience acute hemolysis before 
showing evidence of oxygen desaturation (8, 15, 16). Thus, danger-associated molecular pattern molecules derived from the lysis 
of erythrocytes may ultimately contribute to lung injury in ACS. 
Among the potential candidates, hemin (the oxidized prosthetic 
moiety of Hb) is prototypical. It is a potent inflammatory agonist 
(17) and activator of TLR4 (18). Hemolysis inevitably results in the 
release of hemin into the extracellular space. This process is probably accelerated in SCD because of the enhanced auto-oxidation of 
sickle-cell oxyhemoglobin (19–22) and the presence of free hemin 
at high concentrations (∼1 μM) inside sickle erythrocytes (23).
In the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease, severe acute 
hemolysis was the only predictor of sudden death due to ACS 
(15). A polymorphism that increases the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), the rate-limiting hemin degradation enzyme, is 
associated with lower rates of hospitalization for ACS (24). These 
data, together with the observation that oxidative stress (a promoter of hemin release) increases markedly in patients with ACS 
(25), enhances the logic that hemin may play a central role in the 
pathogenesis of this condition. Here, we investigated the idea 
that extracellular hemin may trigger events that recapitulate the 
inflammation associated with ACS in clinically relevant transgenic 
mouse models of SCD.
Results
Extracellular hemin elevation causes a lethal hemolytic crisis in sickle mice. To 
mimic acute extracellular hemin release, transgenic Townes sickle 
mice (referred to herein as SS mice; see Methods) and control sickletrait (AS) and wild-type human Hb (AA) mice were infused with 
a relatively low dose of purified hemin (35 μmol/kg). No adverse 
effects were seen in the control mice, but a majority of SS mice 
developed labored breathing and died within 2 hours (Figure 1A). 
We confirmed these acute adverse effects in a second murine 
model of SCD (Berkeley sickle mice; see Methods) and showed that 
the lethality rate was dependent on the dose of hemin (Figure 1B). 
A previous study had shown that 40 μmol/kg hemin given i.p. did 
not cause any fatalities in the Berkeley sickle mouse (26). A higher 
dose (70 μmol/kg) given i.v. had no adverse effects in wild-type 
mice (17, 27); moreover, the SS mouse deaths occurred 24 hours 
before hepatic failure onset, due to hemin overload in septic mice 
(28). Thus, our results in the SS mice revealed an unusual effect of 
extracellular hemin that had not previously been described.
Plasma hemopexin (Hx) levels decreased sharply in all animals, 
coincident with nearly 50% clearance of the hemin bolus within

30 minutes in control animals (Figure 1, C and D). Unexpectedly, 
total plasma hemin (TPH) increased in SS mice approximately 
200 μM beyond the amount of hemin infused, concomitant with 
a sharp decrease in total Hb (mean, 1.4 g/dl; Supplemental Figure 1; supplemental material available online with this article; 
doi:10.1172/JCI64578DS1). Whole blood co-oximetry revealed 
a 4-fold increase in percent methemoglobin (metHb; Figure 1E), 
indicative of a robust and sustained increase in oxidant stress exclusively in SS mice. In agreement with these changes, the concentration of plasma free hemin (PFH) increased sharply and remained 
elevated in SS mice (Figure 1F). These results demonstrated a phenomenon of hemin autoamplification that had not been described 
before, which we named extracellular hemin crisis (EHC).
EHC is a prodrome to lethal acute lung injury in SS mice. Respiratory 
dysfunction in ACS patients is investigated routinely using pulse 
oximetry (16, 29). We adopted this approach to monitor SS mice 
using a validated mouse pulse oximeter (30, 31). Baseline levels of 
pulse oximetry oxygen saturation (SpO2) were not different in SS 
and control mice, as reported previously (32). After challenge with 
70 μmol/kg hemin, SpO2 in SS mice decreased progressively, reaching 
approximately 85% for the majority within 30 minutes (Figure 2A). 
In contrast, SpO2 for the control animals remained unchanged 
throughout the experiment. The breath rate reflected the changes — or lack thereof — in SpO2 (Figure 2, A and B). To confirm 
hypoxemia, we measured arterial blood gases. This experiment 
required full anesthetization of mice with ketamine and xylazine, 
which causes mild respiratory depression in rodents (33, 34). 
The baseline levels of arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) and pH were 
closer to normal in AA mice, but reduced in SS mice (Table 1). 
Arterial oxygen saturation (SO2) for the SS mice matched previously reported values (35). Blood samples obtained 20 minutes 
after injection with 70 μmol/kg hemin revealed severe hypoxemia 
and worsening hypercapnia and acidosis — all hallmarks of acute 
lung injury (ALI) — in SS mice; no significant changes occurred in 
AA mice (Figure 2C and Table 1). SO2 values obtained using the 
2 methods correlated with high significance (r = 0.97, P < 0.0001, 
n = 22; data not shown). Lungs of SS mice that succumbed to 
hemin revealed vascular congestion, edema, alveolar wall thickening, and hemorrhage (Figure 2, D–F).
Components of EHC associated with lethal ALI in SS mice. To determine whether intravascular hemolysis per se causes ALI in SS mice, 
we studied the phenylhydrazine hemolysis model. Raised plasma 
Hb levels confirmed acute intravascular hemolysis in mice challenged with phenylhydrazine (Supplemental Figure 2A). However, 
hemolysis was relatively modest, was not specific to the SS mice, 
and did not significantly raise PFH or exhaust plasma Hx levels 
(Supplemental Figure 2, B and C). Importantly, SS mice that experienced phenylhydrazine-induced intravascular hemolysis did not 
develop ALI (Figure 2F). To further define the hemolytic components involved in the hemin ALI model, a random cohort of SS 
mice (n = 14) was challenged with 35 μmol/kg hemin. As expected, 
approximately 30% of these animals survived, while the majority 
developed severe respiratory symptoms and died within 2 hours 
(data not shown). Analysis of blood samples taken 5 minutes after 
hemin challenge showed no difference in the acute levels of metHb 
percentage, plasma Hb, or TPH in association with these 2 dispaFigure 1

rate outcomes (Figure 3, A–C). However, compared with the animals that survived, those that died had significantly higher acute 
PFH, consistent with the approximately 2-fold lower mean baseline 
plasma Hx (Figure 3, D and E). A significantly higher lung wet/dry 
weight ratio confirmed that the nonsurviving SS mice had severe 
ALI (Figure 3F). Collectively, these results suggested that PFH, not 
plasma Hb or metHb, was the major ALI trigger in this model.
Low plasma Hx is a risk factor for hemin-induced lethal ALI in SS mice. 
To test whether Hx plays a protective role in this new model of 
ALI, 3 groups of SS mice (defined by baseline Hx level) were challenged with 35 μmol/kg hemin. All animals in the low-Hx group 
(<0.1 mg/ml or <1.67 μM; n = 7) developed respiratory symptoms 
and died within 2 hours, and 50% of the high-Hx group (>0.25 mg/ml 
or >4.16 μM; n = 10) survived, while the medium-Hx group 
(0.1–0.25 mg/ml or 1.67–4.16 μM; n = 9) had an intermediate 
prognosis (Figure 4A). Next, we assessed the prophylactic potential of recombinant human Hx (rhHx), and to exclude the potential contribution of LPS contamination of hemin to ALI. SS mice 
were randomized to receive 1 mg rhHx, 50 μg polymyxin B, 1 mg 
human IgG, or 200 μl Hx carrier vehicle, and then challenged with 
70 μmol/kg hemin. Mice pretreated with Hx did not develop 
ALI and remained alive, while all others developed severe respiratory symptoms and succumbed within 2 hours (Figure 4B). These 
results unambiguously identified PFH as the dominant factor 
responsible for lethal ALI in SS mice. In another experiment, a 
cohort of SS mice was challenged with hypoxia (8% oxygen) for 
3 hours, followed by reoxygenation for 4 hours. None of these mice 
succumbed, consistent with the lack of acute adverse outcome in 
previous studies using similar hypoxia/reoxygenation protocols 
(data not shown). SpO2 and breath rate did not change from baseline at the end of reoxygenation, and histology showed no evidence 
of lung injury (Figure 4, C–E). Interestingly, hypoxia/reoxygenation 
decreased plasma Hb, while PFH remained unchanged, in SS mice 
(Supplemental Figure 3A and Figure 4F). These data were corroborated by increased plasma concentrations of Hx and haptoglobin in 
the same animals (Figure 4G and Supplemental Figure 3B).
Extracellular and intracellular hemin toxicities are organ specific. 
Excess circulating hemin has previously been implicated in the 
development of hepatic failure (28). We reasoned that the mechanism of hepatic and lung toxicity described herein is unique. To

test this idea, groups of SS mice were injected with 70 μmol/kg 
hemin to induce EHC or with 25 μmol/kg to create a noncritical elevation in extracellular hemin (NCEH). EHC caused severe 
hypoxemia and 100% lethality within 2 hours, while NCEH was 
characterized by normal SpO2 and 45% lethality 12–72 hours 
later (Figure 5, A and B). SS mice at baseline showed raised plasma 
concentrations of alanine transaminase (ALT; SS, 150.5 ± 26.5 IU/l; 
AS, 57.7 ± 13.2 IU/l; AA, 29.5 ± 8.3 IU/l; n = 6; P = 0.0006) 
and aspartate transaminase (AST; SS, 321.6 ± 39.4 IU/l; AS, 
185.5 ± 31.1 IU/l; AA, 154.7 ± 32.3 IU/l; n = 6; P = 0.0086), indicative of underlying liver disease. ALT and AST levels in SS mice 
with EHC remained unchanged at the median time of death. 
Meanwhile, ALT and AST rose 3.0- and 4.3-fold, respectively, 
24 hours later in NCEH animals (Figure 5, C and D), which implicated hepatic failure in the death of these animals (Figure 5B). 
Histological analysis of H&E-stained sections confirmed the 
organ-specific damage: iron was more abundant and diffusely 
distributed in the cytoplasm in the hepatocytes of SS mice with 
NCEH (Figure 5E). These results showed that excess 
circulating hemin caused at least 2 spatiotemporal 
pathologies defined by the extra- and intracellular 
compartmentalization of hemin.
The TLR4 antagonist TAK-242 protects SS mice from 
hemin-induced ALI. To define the primary mediator of 
the acute inflammatory response to PFH, we focused 
on TLR4, a known hemin receptor (18). TAK-242 
binds to Cys747 of the intracellular domain of TLR4 
and inhibits downstream signaling (36). A cohort of 
SS mice was given i.v. TAK-242 or its intralipid vehicle, 
and then EHC was induced with 35 μmol/kg hemin. 
TAK-242 and vehicle did not alter hemin scavenging: 
lung function remained normal in the majority of SS 
mice pretreated with 5 mg/kg TAK-242, whereas those pretreated with vehicle developed hypoxemia (Figure 6, A and B). 72% of 
SS mice given 5 mg/kg TAK-242 were protected, compared with 
57% and 26% given 3 mg/kg TAK-242 and vehicle, respectively 
(Figure 6C). The prophylactic effect of TAK-242 against ALI was 
confirmed by histology (Figure 6, D and E).
Extracellular hemin causes lethal ALI in wild-type mice, but not TLR4-
null mice. To confirm the involvement of TLR4 in this new model 
of ALI, we studied mutant mouse strain B6.B10ScN-Tlr4lps–del/JthJ 
(referred to herein as B6TLR4–/–), with a small deletion in the 
mouse Tlr4 gene, and its wild-type control (B6TLR4+/+) (37). A relatively high dose of hemin (210 μmol/kg) was required to raise PFH 
in these mice to comparable levels in the SS mice given 35 μmol/kg. 
Whereas B6TLR4+/+ mice developed lethal ALI, B6TLR4–/–
mice remained asymptomatic (Figure 7, A–E). The high 210-μmol/kg 
hemin dose used in this experiment was also lethal in AS and AA 
mice (Supplemental Figure 4A). These results confirmed that the 
basic mechanism responsible for the lung injury in our model

is independent of SCD. Previous studies have shown that other 
porphyrins do not activate TLR4 (18). In agreement with those 
findings, sodium protoporphyrin IX (Na-PPIX) and iron mesoporphyrin [Fe(III)MPIX] had no adverse effects in B6TLR4+/+ mice 
(Supplemental Figure 4B). To further confirm the involvement 
of TLR4, we performed experiments in the C3H/HeJ mouse. This 
strain was also protected from the severe respiratory symptoms 
and sudden lethality associated with PFH, whereas its wild-type 
control (C3H/HeOuJ) was not (Supplemental Figure 5). However, all C3H/HeJ mice died within 2 days, with evidence of severe 
hepatic failure (Supplemental Figure 6, A–D). Thus, TLR4 mediated the lethal ALI induced by PFH, while the hepatic toxicity 
involving intracellular hemin was TLR4 independent.
The TLR4-mediating lethal ALI in SS mice resides in the vessel wall. To 
identify the key cell population involved in this new ALI model 
involving hemin, we used bone marrow chimeras to isolate the 
effects on hematopoietic (e.g., neutrophil) or resident nonhematopoietic (e.g., endothelium) components. Bone marrow from 
SS mice was transplanted into B6TLR4+/+ and B6TLR4–/– mice to 
generate sickle hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic chimeras, 
respectively (referred to herein as SSTLR4+/+ and SSNH/TLR4–/–). The 
chimeras acquired a hematological phenotype similar to that of 
wild-type SS (SSWT) mice 8 weeks after transplantation (Supplemental Table 1). EHC was successfully induced in both chimeras 
(Table 2). Subsequently, SSTLR4+/+ chimeras developed labored 
breathing, became hypoxemic, and suffered a high rate of lethality, 
whereas SSNH/TLR4–/– chimeras remained asymptomatic (Figure 8, 
A–C). These findings were corroborated by histology and gravimetric analysis (Figure 8, D–F).
Hx and TAK-242 treatment prevents respiratory failure in SS mice. 
We examined the feasibility of hemin sequestration and TLR4 
blockade as a therapeutic strategy to treat the acute effects of 
excess extracellular hemin. Random cohorts of SS mice were 
treated with rhHx and TAK-242 at the onset of hemolytic crisis, immediately after challenge with 35 μmol/kg hemin. None 
of the Hx-treated animals developed respiratory symptoms, and 
they all survived; >70% of mice given 7.5 mg/kg TAK-242 were 
also effectively treated. However, a lower 5-mg/kg TAK-242 dose, 
which was effective as prophylaxis in our earlier experiments, was 
not effective as a therapeutic in this experiment (Figure 9A). At 
20 minutes after initiation of treatment, SpO2 was normal in all 
mice given Hx, and in a majority 8 of 11 (73%) given 7.5 mg/kg 
TAK-242. SpO2 values were <95% in 3 of 11 (27%) SS mice given 
TAK-242 and in 5 of 6 (83%) untreated mice, none of which 
recovered (Figure 9B).
Analysis of blood samples collected 30 minutes after treatment 
showed that rhHx effectively cleared hemin from the mouse circulation (Figure 9C). As expected, TPH remained elevated in TAK-242–
treated mice (Figure 9C), since the mechanism of action of this 
drug is TLR4 blockade, not hemin sequestration. ALI, assessed 
by histology and lung wet/dry weight ratio, was consistent with 
our lung physiology and survival data (Figure 9, D–F). Finally, in a 
subset of SS mice, we initiated treatment when there was evidence 
of respiratory distress, as determined by significant reductions in 
SpO2. Treatment with rhHx reversed the decline in SpO2, followed 
by steady improvement in breath rate and normalization of lung 
function (Figure 9, G and H). TAK-242 did not rescue these SS 
mice, analogous to prior findings in a mouse endotoxin model 
when the drug was given after the disease process involving LPS 
was already well underway (38).

vention, and treatment of ACS. First, we identified an autoamplification of extracellular hemin phenomenon in SCD. Second, 
we found that the hemin amplification was associated with ALI 
development and sudden death in mouse models of SCD. PFH 
was identified as the trigger, and low plasma Hx as the risk factor, for these sequelae. Third, TLR4 expressed in the vessel wall 
was found to be essential for the pathogenesis of this murine 
model of ALI. Finally, we demonstrated therapeutic as well as 
prophylactic roles for targeting the acute adverse effects of PFH 
with Hx and by TLR4 blockade. Thus, a vascular inflammatory 
response to excess extracellular hemin may play a central role in 
the pathogenesis of ACS.
SCD patients have raised plasma hemin concomitant with low 
Hx level (39, 40); however, the clinical significance of this interrelated anomaly had not previously been defined. Indirect evidence from clinical studies suggests that alterations in hemin 
catabolism contribute to the development of ACS. In a candidate 
gene study of 945 children in the silent infarct transfusion trial, a 
polymorphism in the HMOX-1 gene (which enhances expression 
of HO-1, the rate-limiting hemin degradation enzyme) was associated with lower rates of ACS incidence (24). More recently, using 
multivariable regression analysis, we found that in children with 
SCD, higher baseline PFH is associated with increased odds of 
ACS (P = 0.016; odds ratio, 2.56; confidence interval, 1.19–5.47; 
ref. 41). These studies provide important clinical relevancy to our 
present findings that free hemin in the intravascular space directly caused lethal ALI, reminiscent of ACS, in 2 different mouse 
strains of SCD (Figures 1 and 2).
Acute hemolysis involving the loss of a large concentration of 
Hb (mean, 0.7–3.6 g/dl) preceding ACS is well documented in 
humans (2, 5–9, 15), and we observed a similar phenomenon in 
mice. In the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease, in which 
there were 1,722 episodes of ACS in 939 patients, severe acute 
hemolysis that potentially increased extracellular Hb by 3.6 g/dl 
(equivalent to ∼2.23 mM hemin) was the only predictor of sudden death (15). Elevated LDH levels during ACS indicate that 
the hemolysis preceding this condition is largely intravascular 
(6), although not all the liberated Hb may become converted to 
hemin. Nonetheless, when we gave less than 20% of the hemin 
concentration associated with sudden death in the aforementioned human trial (i.e., 0.43 mM) to the SS mice in this study, 
70% developed lethal ALI. This result suggests that the amount 
of hemin we used to trigger the ACS-like disease in SS mice is 
clinically reasonable.
Sickle erythrocytes trapped in vasoocclusions with reduced 
flow, shielded from plasma scavengers, and undergoing acute 
lysis are most likely the major sources of acute elevation in local 
extracellular hemin concentrations in patients. Thus, it may 
be challenging to directly determine the concentration of PFH 
that triggers ACS in patients. Our recent study suggests a highFigure 5

range, 0.61–2.92 μM; n = 38; P < 0.01). One potential explanation for this difference is that, in common with other primates, 
human albumin forms a stable complex with hemin, unlike albumin from rodents (42). Indeed, the level of methemalbumin in the 
plasma of SCD patients is markedly elevated (43), highlighting 
the additional buffering of hemin in humans that is not available 
in mice. Albumin and other plasma proteins ultimately transfer 
hemin to Hx for delivery to the liver, the hemin/Hx complex is 
internalized, and hemin is degraded by HO-1. This catabolism 
occurs at an extremely rapid rate in SCD patients (40). Consequently, the Hx concentration in human SCD plasma is very low 
(39, 40), which we have previously confirmed (0.24 ± 0.02 mg/ml, 
or 4.0 ± 0.33 μM; n = 81; ref. 41). In the present study, we demonstrated that SS mouse plasma had a similarly low level of Hx 
(0.15 ± 0.01 mg/ml, or 2.5 ± 0.16 μM; n = 78) that was inadequate 
to counter a clinically feasible elevation in extracellular hemin 
that ultimately resulted in lethal ALI.
While our model recapitulates the key clinical features of human 
ACS defined by the National Acute Chest Syndrome Study Group 
(5), these features are not found in existing animal models of 
sickle-lung injury based on infection (10), hypoxia, and hypoxia/
reoxygenation (14, 35, 44). Therefore, we believe our model represents a major breakthrough in this field. However, like many 
other animal models of ALI, it is potentially limited by the firstpass effect. Several evidentiary examples from our study mitigate 
this concern. The most compelling was the successful treatment of 
SS mice with rhHx several minutes after receiving a hemin bolus. 
This recovery can be explained by the sequestration of a residual 
of the hemin bolus, or more likely endogenous hemin released by 
the ensuing EHC. Ironically, the SS mice in our study had 10-fold 
higher concentrations of plasma HO-1 (data not shown), which 
suggests they were more poised than the control mice to rapidly 
degrade the hemin bolus in the systemic circulation as well as in 
the liver, where expression of this enzyme is also upregulated in 
SCD (45, 46). Our data suggest that it was the Hx in the systemic 
circulation, and not hepatic metabolism, that greatly reduced the 
potency of the hemin bolus to cause lung injury in SS mice.
Importantly, we excluded LPS, a potential contaminant of 
commercial preparations of hemin, as the source of ALI in our 
model. In addition, key features of ALI are substantially different for the hemin model described here and for LPS (47). However, there are similarities with other ALI models characterized 
by rapid hypoxemia and sudden lethality (48, 49). Because of the 
high concentration of TPH required to induce it in nonsickle 
mice, the hemin ALI may be unique to SCD, with in vivo amplification of hemin playing a potentially central role. In addition, 
free hemin modulates the expression of COMMD7 in cultured 
pulmonary endothelial cells (50). This gene is highly expressed 
in the lung (51) and interacts with NF-κB signaling (51, 52), and 
a recent study found that it contains a polymorphism with an 
array-wide significant association with ACS (P = 4.1 × 10–7) in the 
Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease cohort (50). Although 
more work is needed to clarify the role of the endothelium in our 
model, these results, together with our present findings using chimeric SS mice, add further evidence in support of a role for hemin 
signaling in the pulmonary endothelium in ACS.
One of the most fascinating findings of this study is the discovery of extracellular hemin autoamplification. This phenomenon

may help to explain a paradox reported nearly 50 years ago: that 
the plasma of SCD patients contains inexplicably higher concentrations of hemin discordant with the corresponding levels 
of plasma Hb (39). It is too early to know exactly what controls 
this process; however, several clues emerged from our present 
findings. Whereas oxidation of intracellular Hb by extracellular 
hemin occurred at a faster rate in SS than control mice, other 
oxidants do not show this differential effect for sickle-cell Hb 
(HbS) in vitro (53). The newly formed metHbS persisted probably because of the low activity of metHb reductase in sickle 
erythrocytes (54). In addition, hemolysis in sickle mice occurred 
more rapidly than in wild-type mouse erythrocytes exposed to 
similar concentrations of free hemin ex vivo (55, 56). Collectively, 
these observations provide a framework for further research to 
delineate the factors that influence EHC and to examine its role 
in end-organ damage in SCD.
The current state-of-the-art management of ACS is entirely supportive, involving interventions such as supplemental oxygen, empiric 
antibiotics, and blood transfusions (57). These therapies are not targeted or standardized; furthermore, they are associated with multiple 
risks. Consequently, a major clinical objective in SCD is to prevent 
ACS, using various disease-modifying approaches, particularly in 
patients with repeated episodes and in those hospitalized with VOC. 
Thus, a major strength of our study is that it may help to refine this 
prophylactic strategy by targeting specific molecules, such as hemin, 
and other pathways directly involved in causing lung injury. A targeted approach may also be effective therapeutically, as shown here for 
SS mice with respiratory distress that were saved from respiratory failure using rhHx. We have also identified TLR4 antagonists as potential 
agents for drug repurposing in SCD, despite their recent setbacks in 
sepsis trials (58–60). There is an emerging consensus that these drugs 
perform poorly in sepsis trials because it may be too late to block

Tlr4 gene; stock no. 007227), wild-type C3H/HeOuJ (stock no. 000635), 
and C3H/HeJ congenics, with a point mutation in the mouse Tlr4 gene 
(stock no. 000659). Mice were injected with (a) freshly prepared solutions 
of hemin, hemin analogs, and saline (i.v.); (b) rhHx (i.v.; 1 mg/mouse), 
for which the lyophilization buffer (25 mM MES, 0.15M NaCl) for 
the preparation of rhHx was used as vehicle; (c) phenylhydrazine (i.p.; 
100 mg/kg); (d) TAK-242 or intralipid vehicle (i.v.); and (e) aqueous solution of Polymyxin B as previously described (63). For hypoxia/reoxygenation experiments, SS mice housed in their standard cages were transferred into a hypoxia chamber (BioSpherix) fitted with a ProOx 110 gas 
controller (BioSpherix) in line with a high pressure double gauge mixed 
gas primary nitrogen regulator fitted onto a vaporized nitrogen source. 
Mice were exposed to 8% oxygen for 3 hours and returned to room air 
(reoxygenation) for 4 hours as previously described (35). Mice were phlebotomized by retro-orbital bleeding using a capillary tube internally coated with heparin/EDTA anticoagulant.
Whole blood co-oximetry. Total Hb concentration and percent metHb were 
measured in venous whole blood using a portable CO-oximeter (AVOXImeter 
4000; ITC) as described previously (64). The device measures the level of 
different Hb parameters using novel optics and multiple wavelengths (65). 
Plasma Hb concentration was determined by colorimetric method using a 
Quantichrome Hb assay kit (Bioassay Systems).
Plasma biomarker analysis. Freshly collected EDTA anticoagulated blood 
samples were centrifuged at 1,200 g, 4°C, for 10 minutes to collect plasma. 
In some experiments, this unfractionated plasma was subjected to a second 
spin through a Microcon YM-3 column (Millipore) at 20,000 g, 4°C, for 
2 hours to prepare a protein-depleted plasma fraction devoid of molecules 
of MW >3 kDa. Hemin content in the unfractionated and protein-depleted 
plasma was quantified to obtain TPH and PFH, respectively, using a colorimetric assay kit (Bioassay Systems) as described previously (64, 66). ELISA 
TLR4 once septic shock is already underway. Although TAK-242 was 
not effective in SS mice with established respiratory distress, it prevented respiratory failure when administered at the onset of hemolytic crisis. Importantly, a majority of SCD patients (up to 70% in one 
study; ref. 6) who develop ACS present initially with well-defined antecedent events that are interceded by acute hemolysis. Thus, acute prophylaxis using TLR4 blockade may be an attractive strategy to alter 
the course of ACS clinically. In conclusion, we offer a mechanism to 
explain the pathogenesis of ACS and a rational strategy that may help 
to develop targeted therapies for this life-threatening condition.
Methods
Reagents and drugs. Hemin [Fe(III)PPIX; Frontier Scientific Inc. and 
Sigma-Aldrich] was prepared by dissolving in 0.25M NaOH, pH was neutralized to 7.4 with HCl, and the solution was adjusted to required concentration with PBS, filter sterilized, and used immediately. Na-PPIX and Fe(III)
MPIX (Frontier Scientific Inc.) were dissolved and used as described for 
hemin. Endotoxin contamination in porphyrin preparations was screened 
using the Toxin Sensor Chromogenic LAL Endotoxin Assay Kit (GenScript). 
rhHx (>90% purity) was custom prepared and lyophilized in 25 mM 
MES, 0.15 M NaCl buffer (R&D Systems). Human IgG protein was procured from Abcam. TAK-242, a small-molecule inhibitor of TLR4 signaling, 
was purchased from Invivogen and dissolved in intralipid (Sigma-Aldrich). 
Polymyxin B and phenylhydrazine were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.
Mice and procedures. We have established colonies of both the Townes 
(SS; ref. 61) and Berkeley (62) sickle mice in our laboratory, as previously 
reported (46). Mouse genotypes were confirmed either by PCR or Hb gel 
electrophoresis. The following mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory: B6TLR4+/+ (wild-type C57BL/6J; stock no. 000664), B6TLR4–/–
congenics (B6.B10ScN-Tlr4lps–del/JthJ, with a small deletion in the mouse

then dried in an oven at 80°C containing desiccant crystals for 24 hours, dry 
weight was determined, and lung wet/dry weight ratios were calculated (67).
Bone marrow transplantation. B6TLR4+/+ and B6TLR4–/– mice were maintained on acidified drinking water for 7 days and subjected to 2 doses of 
6-Gy irradiation given 4 hours apart. Irradiated mice were transplanted 
with 5 × 106 whole bone marrow cells harvested from SS mouse donors. 
The transplanted SSTLR4+/+ and SSNH/TLR4–/– chimeras were maintained on 
medicated water (0.5 mg/ml neomycin, 0.0125 mg/ml polymyxin B) for 
1 week. Blood samples were collected from transplanted mice 8 weeks after 
transplant for complete blood count (CBC) using a HemaTrue hematology analyzer (Heska) and to assess engraftment of donor bone marrow and 
reticulocyte count using flow cytometry.
Histopathology. Lungs and livers were harvested immediately after 
death, or removed at the end of specific experiments (usually 2 hours), 
and fixed uniformly with 10% buffered formalin. Tissue sections were 
stained with H&E and examined using an Olympus AX70 microscope, 
and images were recorded with an Olympus U-CMAD3 DP70 camera and 
Olympus DP70/DP30 BW software (version 02.0201.147). Histopathological analysis was performed by a modified extensive scoring system, 
as previously described (35, 68, 69). 4 criteria were used to score lung 
injury: edema, hemorrhage, alveolar wall thickening and vascular congestion. Sections were scored as follows: 0, absent; 1, mild; 2, moderate; 
with specific commercial kits (Kamiya Biomedical Co.) was used to measure 
Hx and haptoglobin concentration according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Enzyme activity of ALT and AST was measured using a colorimetric 
method (Teco Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Pulse-oximetry. The MouseOx pulse-oximeter (Starr Life Sciences) was 
used (31) to measure real-time SpO2 (percentage of functional arterial 
Hb) and breath rate per minute in awake conditions. Hairs from the collar region (back of the neck) were removed using a depilatory agent 1 day 
before actual measurement. A disposable sensory collar clip attached to the 
pulse-oximeter was placed on the hairless area, and measurements were initiated through MouseOx software (version 6.3; provided by the manufacturer) when data displays were without error codes. Recorded values were 
pooled for each consecutive 5-minute interval, and mean values were then 
used for analysis where continuous screening was presented.
Blood gas analysis. Animals were anesthetized using recommended doses 
of ketamine and xylazine given i.p. A left ventricular heart puncture was 
performed with a heparinized syringe to collect the arterial blood. PaO2
was measured, and SO2 was determined immediately from the whole blood 
using a VitalPath blood gas and electrolyte analyzer (Heska).
Gravimetric analysis of lung edema. The whole lungs were harvested from 
mice, either immediately after death or 2 hours after hemin injection, and 
weighed using an isometric transducer (Harvard Apparatus). Lungs were

3, severe; 4, very severe. Individual scores were tabulated from the mean 
score from 6 random focal areas (magnification, ×100) to obtain an 
overall score ranging 0–16. The mean injury score was determined for 
lungs from each animal in an experimental group (n = 3–6) to generate 
a cumulative lung injury score. In addition to H&E, liver tissue sections 
were stained with Perls’ Prussian blue and counterstained with fast-red 
to detect intracellular iron.
Statistics. To analyze statistical significance, 2-tailed unpaired Student’s t
test or 1-way ANOVA was used as appropriate. Survival rates were compared 
by log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. GraphPad Prism 5 software was used for all 
statistical analyses. A P value less than 0.05 was considered significant.
Study approval. All mice studies were approved by IACUC of Emory University (protocol no. DAR-2001829-070813).
