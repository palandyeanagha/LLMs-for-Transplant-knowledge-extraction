Abstract
Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF) is a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by a clonal myeloproliferation
and a myelofibrosis. The concomitant presence of neoangiogenesis and osteosclerosis suggests a deregulation of
medullar stem cell niches in which hematopoietic stem cells are engaged in a constant crosstalk with their stromal
environment. Despite the recently discovered mutations including the JAK2Val617F mutation, the primitive molecular
event responsible for the clonal hematopoietic proliferation is still unknown. We propose that the “specificity” of
the pathological process that caracterizes PMF results from alterations in the cross talk between hematopoietic and
stromal cells. These alterations contribute in creating a abnormal microenvironment that participates in the
maintenance of the neoplasic clone leading to a misbalance disfavouring normal hematopoiesis; in return or
simultaneously, stromal cells constituting the niches are modulated by hematopoietic cells resulting in stroma
dysfunctions. Therefore, PMF is a remarkable “model” in which deregulation of the stem cell niche is of utmost
importance for the disease development. A better understanding of the crosstalk between stem cells and their
niches should imply new therapeutic strategies targeting not only intrinsic defects in stem cells but also regulatory
niche-derived signals and, consequently, hematopoietic cell proliferation.
Introduction
Philadelphia-negative chronic myeloproliferative neoplams (Ph- MPNs) are clonal hemopathies that arise
from the oncogenic transformation of hematopoietic
stem/progenitor cells that conserve full differentiation
potential with qualitative and quantitative abnormalities
[1]. They share several common features in including
abnormal proliferation of hematopoietic cells from one
or more cell lineages with a hypersensitivity to growth
factors and decreased apoptosis [2]. In contrast to
chronic myeloid leukaemia, the molecular mechanisms
leading to Ph- MPN progression have remained unclear
until the recent finding of the V617F JAK2 mutation in
most of Polycythemia Vera (PV) and half of Essential
Thrombocytosis (ET) and Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF)
cases ([3], see for review [4]). This discovery has
revolutionized the understanding of the biology of at
least PV, by showing that kinase pathway alterations are
part of the pathological process leading to hematopoietic
proliferation and growth factor hypersensitivity. However, the fact that the JAK2+ syndromes exhibit various
clinical features raises the question of how a single mutation can generate different MPNs and strongly suggests
that other acquired events have to occur, at least in ET
and PMF.
Besides the potential role of altered growth factor signaling pathways, a number of converging arguments suggests that changes within the hematopoietic environment
also take part in MPN pathogenesis. The most significant
elements in favor of this assumption emerge from studies
on PMF that is the rarest and most complex Ph- MPN.
Primary myelofibrosis is characterized by an extramedullary hematopoiesis with progressive hepato-splenomegaly
resulting from the prominent mobilization of hematopoietic progenitors from bone marrow to spleen and
liver. Such alteration of hematopoiesis is constantly associated with profound modifications of the bone marrow

and spleen stroma as demonstrated by the presence of
myelofibrosis, osteosclerosis and neoangiogenesis in PMF
patients [5] (Figure 1).
Recently, evidences are accumulating that stromal cells
may play an active role in the promotion or maintenance
of myeloproliferative disorders in mice and that stromal
dysfunction can even act as a primary enabler of inefficient
hematopoiesis and secondary hematopoietic neoplastic
transformation [6,7]. In human MPNs and especially in
PMF, we hypothesised that alterations of stromal cells
contribute to the hematopoietic clone development [8],
therefore revisiting the “good seeds (stem cells) in bad soil
(stroma)” model [9] in the “bad seeds in bad soil” concept.
Hematopoiesis is regulated by medullar niches
According to A. Spradling, “the true nature of stem cells
can be learned only by discovering how they are regulated” [10]. In the bone marrow, the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) are under
control of cellular and humoral regulatory signals created
by the hematopoietic stem cell niches (see for review
[11]). Within these niches, HSC are engaged in a constant crosstalk with their environment, responding to
numerous signals such as secreted growth factors, oxygen
and calcium variations, and are maintained in close contact with stromal cells within the proximity of the endosteal surface and of the vascular network via adhesion
molecules.
Whether the concept of hematopoietic niches is dating
from Schofield in 1978 [12], their exact location in the
bone marrow is still under debate. In healthy adult
mice, it is commonly accepted that most HSCs are
located close to the endosteal lining cells in the trabecular area. Staining of sections of adult hematopoietic tissues also revealed the presence of HSCs around bone
marrow sinusoids (perivascular niches) (Figure 2). However, it is uncertain whether both locations represent
niches and, if so, whether they are spatially distinct
niches or whether endosteal cells and perivascular cells
collaborate to form a common niche in which mesenchymal stem cells would be an essential link [13-15].
Furthermore, it remains to be determined whether these
locations actively promote the maintenance of HSCs, or
whether HSCs simply pass through some of them during their migration.
Several cellular components have been suggested to
comprise the endosteal niches; these include osteoblasts,
CXCL12 abundant reticular cells (CAR), osteoclasts and
sympathetic neurons [13,16-18]. Dormant HSCs are probably tightly anchored in endosteal niches through interactions with numerous adhesion molecules such as Ncadherin, CD44 and various integrins. Several growth factor- and chemokine-receptors expressed by HSCs that
bind soluble or membrane-bound ligands produced by
niche cells have been shown to be crucial for inhibiting
HSC division by retention within the niche, thus preserving
their dormancy and progressive lost by exhaustion [13,14].
Anatomical relationships of HSCs with bone marrow
stroma cells have also implied vascular endothelial-cadherin+ sinusoidal endothelial cells (SECs) [19,20], perivascular cells and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) [15,21] as
additional components of the niche. Both osteoblastic
[16] and endothelial cells [22] can promote the maintenance of HSCs in culture, and both cell types influence
each other, which makes it difficult to attribute specific
functions to the endosteal or perivascular niches [23].
Moreover, a significant number of HSCs are not localized
adjacent to the endosteum and sinusoids, suggesting that
additional cells, including adiponectin-secreting adipocytes, may also contribute to the maintenance of HSCs
in vivo [24].
Primary Myelofibrosis, a disease associating a
clonal myeloproliferation and an alteration of
hematopoietic stroma
The clonal myeloproliferation
In PMF patients, the myeloproliferative process is characterized by several abnormalities [9,25] including : i) the
multipotency of the hematopoietic clonal stem cells with
myeloid and lymphoid differentiation although an absolute lymphopenia has been described in peripheral blood,
ii) the progressive dominance of clonal hematopoiesis
Figure 1 Pathophysiological characteristics of PMF. Primary
myelofibrosis is characterized by a clonal amplification of
hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and a prominent proliferation of
“dystrophic” megakaryocytes (MK) that partly result from the
presence of gain-of-function mutations involving JAK2 and MPL
genes and that is associated with a migration of HSC from bone
marrow (BM) to spleen and liver through peripheral blood (PB).
Such myeloproliferation is associated with alterations of stroma
featured by a myelofibrosis, an osteosclerosis and a
neoangiogenesis. This stromal reaction is reported to be secondary
to the stimulation of stromal cells including fibroblasts, osteoblasts
and endothelial cells by growth factors (GFs) produced in excess by
cells from the hematopoietic clone and especially by MK cells.

over normal polyclonal hematopoiesis, resulting in the
overproduction of one or more of the mature blood elements, iii) the hypersensitivity of hematopoietic progenitors (HP) to growth factors, iv) a striking involvement of
the megakaryocytic (MK) lineage, with hyperplasia and
dysplasia resulting in an excessive production of a number of cytokines and chemokines and, v) the lack of a
consistent cytogenetic abnormality but the presence of
mutations in the JAK2 and in the MPL thrombopoietin
receptor genes.
Whereas the JAK2Val617F acquired mutation represents
the first reliable molecular marker of Ph- MPN, it might
not be the first genetic event and the molecular causes of
the clonal myeloproliferation in PMF patients are still
enigmatic. The pathogenic role of mutated JAK2 and
more recently of mutated Mpl most likely goes through
abnormal activation of signaling molecules including
STAT and MAPK pathways that has been suggested to
take part in the hematopoietic proliferation and increased
sensitivity to cytokines [26,27]. Several other mechanisms
have been proposed to participate in the dysmegakaryopoiesis, including NF-B [28] activation, IL-8 [29] overexpression and more recently FL/Flt3 activation [27].
The stromal reaction
It is accepted that myelofibrosis associating the clonal myeloproliferation is a multifactor process resulting from
alterations of fibroblasts leading to the modified expression
of adhesion molecules and to an increased deposit of extracellular matrix components [30]. This accumulation is suggested to be the consequence of intramedullary release of
growth factors by the malignant hematopoietic clone and
especially by dysplastic megakaryocytes [31]. Among these
growth factors, some would further activate mesenchymal
cells (PDGF, bFGF, TGFb...), leading to the myelofibrosis,
as well as endothelial cells (bFGF, VEGF, IL-8...), participating in the neoangiogenesis [32] (Figure 3). It has been
hypothesized that an increased production of osteoprotegerin by stromal and endothelial cells contributed to the
unbalanced osteoblast production leading to the osteosclerosis frequently associated with myelofibrosis and to
vascular complications [33]. The abnormal trafficking of
CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors and endothelial precursors that features PMF is likely resulting from modification
of their adherence to the bone marrow stroma allowing
them to escape from this niche into the circulation with
homing to the spleen and liver. Several mechanisms,
including disturbance of CXCL12/SDF-1a-CXCR4 signal
[34] through a hypermethylation of its CXCR4 receptor
resulting in a down-regulation of its expression [35], and
an increased extracellular matrix proteolytic activity [36],
also participate in this migration. Thus, in PMF, whereas
the primitive molecular event is still unknown, the “specificity” of the pathological process would result from
Figure 2 Schematic representation of the medullar niches. In healthy adults, hematopoiesis occurs in the bone marrow where
hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are engaged in a constant crosstalk within specific niches. Very schematically, these haematopoietic stem cell
niches are conceptually divided into two niches: The endosteal niche in which osteoblasts, derived from Mesenchymal Stromal Cell (MSC)
differentiation and contributing to bone formation and osteoclats, derived from HSCs, and participating in bone resorption played a crucial role.
The vascular niche in which endothelial cells, resulting from the proliferation and differentiation of Endothelial Stem Cells (ESC), are in close
contact with HSC within the perivascular spaces. Beyond cell-cell contacts through receptor-ligand and adhesion molecule interactions,
extracellular matrix component (EMC), cytokines and chemokines, proteases, calcium and oxygen concentrations are essential environmental
components of these niches.

alterations in the cross talk between hematopoietic and
stromal cells. In this process, stromal cells are conditioned
by growth factor produced by malignant hematopoietic
cells and reciprocally, by acquiring new properties, stromal
cells create a pathological microenvironment that takes
part in the development and maintenance of the clone,
leading to an imbalance that compromises normal hematopoiesis (Figure 4). Therefore, ignoring the environmental
cues that control HSC fate during homeostasis, neoplastic
HSCs can survive at anatomical sites (i.e., spleen and liver)
unable to support normal adult hematopoiesis [8].
Primary Myelofibrosis and the “bad seeds in bad soil”
concept
In PMF, it could be suggested that in response to several environmental factors including cytokines, chemokines, proteases, adhesion molecules, alteration of
calcium and oxygen concentration... there is an imbalance between endosteal and vascular niches within the
bone marrow. Such disequilibrium would favor the proliferation and mobilization of pathological stem cells
including hematopoietic, mesenchymal and endothelial
stem/progenitor cells from the bone marrow to the
blood, leading to bone marrow aplasia and stem cell
mobilization. These stem cells would then migrate into
the spleen where newly created or reinitialized vascular
niches would favor their homing and abnormal differentiation resulting in an extramedullary hematopoiesis at
Figure 3 Role of growth factors in PMF stromal reaction. In PMF, myelofibrosis is a multifactor process resulting from alterations of
fibroblasts/MSC leading to an increased deposit of extracellular matrix components resulting from growth factors released by malignant
hematopoietic cells and especially MK and monocytes. These growth factors would further activate stromal cells, leading to myelofibrosis,
osteosclerosis and neoangiogenesis.
Figure 4 PMF; the “Bad Seeds in Bad Soil” model. In PMF,
whereas the initial molecular defect at the origin of the
hematopoietic clone is still unknown, altered interactions between
CD34+ HSCs and stromal cells in the medullar environment would
result in an increased cytokine production by the clonal
hematopoietic cells and especially by dystrophic megakaryocytes
and monocytes. Production in excess of hematopoietic, fibrogenic,
and angiogenic growth factors would stimulate myelofibrosis,
osteosclerosis and angiogenesis through activation of stromal and
endothelial cells. Consequently, by acquiring new properties, stromal
cells would create a pathological microenvironment that
participates in the development and maintenance of the
hematopoietic clone. Mk: Megakaryocytes; Mo: Monocytes; Ne:

the origin of the splenomegaly that features this disease
[8] (Figure 5). Therefore, by contributing to the hematopoietic clone development, alterations of stromal cells
within hematopoietic stem cell niches are key actors of
PMF pathogenesis process illustrating the “Bad Seeds in
Bad Soil” concept that we proposed (Figure 4).
While chromosomal abnormalities have not been
described in stromal fibroblasts, it could be questioned
whether the initial oncogenic event leading to the MPN
development might occur in a primitive mesodermal stem
cell. The discovery, in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia, of bi-potent hemato-endothelial stem cells which harbor the Ph translocation supports such hypothesis. In
PMF, while the clonality of hematopoietic stem cells is
clear, the contribution of mesenchymal and/or endothelial
stem cells (participating in the hematopoietic niche) to the
malignant clone is not obvious and is still a matter of
debate [37,38]. However, till now, the absence of recurrent
genomic abnormalities in PMF patients does not allow us
to definitively conclude on this challenging concern.
Conclusion and perspectives
Therefore, by combining a clonal proliferation and a
mobilization of hematopoietic stem cell(s) with marked
alterations of the bone marrow and spleen stroma, PMF
illustrates a unique model in which a “hematopoietic
stem cell niche” deregulation plays a key role in the myeloproliferative process. In this manuscript, we have
reviewed clinical parameters and key experimental results
showing that an unbalanced between endosteal and vascular niches in bone marrow and spleen participates in
the development and maintain of the clonal hematopoietic stem cell proliferation leading to this myeloproliferative syndrome. Whereas progress in the understanding of
the role of hematopoietic microenvironment in PMF is
obvious, a number of concerns still remain to be
addressed. Among them: Why is bone marrow stem cell
homing changed? Are spleen niches newly created or
reinitialized and how is spleen stem cell homing developed? Why are bone marrow/endosteal niches disadvantaged to the benefit of spleen/endothelial niches? Do
PMF HSCs exhibit different sensitivity with respect to
the two types of niches and if so, is there a role for the
JAK2 and MPL mutations in this altered sensitivity? Are
there correlations between clinical phenotype and alterations of the niches? Are niche-initiating stem cells
(MSCs) mobilized?...
Besides the conceptual importance of these issues,
new insights into the possible role of hematopoietic
niche deregulation in the pathogenesis of PMF should
open innovative therapeutic strategies for patients whose
treatment has been largely palliative until now. Of
course, innovative therapies must target HSC and treatments with JAK2 inhibitors are currently under clinical
trials with remarkable results on spleen size and constitutional symptom reduction. However, the lack of benefits on stromal alteration including myelofibrosis and on
anemia in anti-JAK2 treated patients argues in favor of
the need for therapies also targeting hematopoietic
niches. These niche-targeted drugs would manipulate
the competitive balance between endosteal and vascular
niches and therefore would modify the stem cell trafficking and homing. By forcing specific niches to reassume a normal function, such treatments would limit
the proliferation and dissemination of the malignant
clone. Therefore, therapeutic approaches based on associating drugs acting on the stem cell clone and on their
regulatory niches might be promising!
