Between June–September 2018, 20 hepatitis A cases 
were notified in six counties in Sweden. Combined 
epidemiological and microbiological investigations 
identified imported frozen strawberries produced in 
Poland as the source of the outbreak. Sequence analysis confirmed the outbreak strain IB in the strawberries with 100 % identity and the respective batch was 
withdrawn. Sharing the sequence information internationally led to the identification of 14 additional 
cases in Austria, linked to strawberries from the same 
producer.
Hepatitis A virus is an important cause of food-borne 
diseases and has been associated with several 
European outbreaks linked to berries [1-4]. Here, we 
describe an ongoing outbreak of hepatitis A virus (HAV) 
in Sweden and Austria and the confirmation of frozen 
strawberries imported from Poland as the source of 
infection. The aims are to highlight the importance of 
sequencing in outbreak investigations and, due to the 
long shelf-life of the food vehicle, to increase awareness and warnings towards HAV infections related to 
frozen strawberries in Europe.
Outbreak identification
On 14 June 2018, the Public Health Agency of Sweden 
(PHAS) received a notification from the Regional Office 
of Communicable Disease Control and Prevention of a 
suspected local outbreak of HAV in County A with five 
cases. An epidemiological investigation was initiated 
by county A together with PHAS and the National Food 
Agency (NFA).
Between 11 June and 27 July 2018, 20 confirmed and 
probable cases were reported from six counties (Figure 
1). HAV genotyping of 17 of the 20 cases confirmed an 
identical genotype IB strain (the outbreak strain).
Case definition
A confirmed case was defined as a person with laboratory-confirmed hepatitis A and dates of symptoms onset after 1 May 2018 (Sweden) or 1 June 2018 
(Austria) and with a sequence identical to the HAV subgenotype IB outbreak strain (MH730560, submitted to 
GenBank), based on an overlapping fragment of the 
VP1/P2A region. Probable cases were those diagnosed 
with hepatitis A with an epidemiological link to the 
strawberries of the identified producer but who were 
not sequence-confirmed.
Epidemiology
As at 09 October 2018, the outbreak in Sweden comprised 20 cases, of whom 17 were confirmed cases and 
three were probable. Dates of symptom onset ranged 

2 www.eurosurveillance.org
from 30 May to 10 July 2018 (Figure 2). The age of the 
cases ranged from 9–92 years (median 41.5 years) and 
the majority of the cases were women (n = 13/20). All 
cases had domestically acquired HAV infections and 
came from six different counties in Southern Sweden 
(Figure 1). The epidemiological investigation was 
coordinated by PHAS and included a standard questionnaire for hepatitis A on exposures and telephone 
interviews, conducted by the local Regional Offices 
of Communicable Disease Control and Prevention. 
Results showed that all cases had consumed strawberries within 30 days before disease onset and at least 10 
cases had consumed strawberry smoothies at two different juice bars of the same franchiser (county A). Five 
cases had consumed a dessert with sauce made from 
frozen strawberries at three different elderly homes 
(county A, B and E) and two cases (from county C and 
D) reported eating a mix of berries at a breakfast buffet 
at the same hotel in county A. One case had a strawberry smoothie at a restaurant (county A). The two 
cases from county F consumed strawberry smoothies 
served at a school. Environmental investigations and 
interviews with kitchen personnel revealed that in 
none of the cases had the strawberries been heated 
adequately before serving. Strawberries were the only 
food item that all the cases had in common. 
As at 04 October 2018, a total of 36 cases of laboratory-confirmed acute hepatitis A were reported to public health authorities in Austria (since June) of which 
14 fulfilled the definition of a confirmed outbreak case 
and four were classified as non-outbreak cases based 
on sequence-typing data; for the remaining 18 cases, 
sequence-typing data are not available and questioning 
regarding food exposure during their incubation period 
is ongoing. For the 14 confirmed outbreak cases, disease onset ranged from 8 June to 20 September (Figure 
2), the median age was 21.0 years (range 5–70 years) 
including eight males and six females. Thirteen were 
residents in three neighbouring provinces in Eastern 
Austria. Telephone interviews using a standardised 
questionnaire on food exposure and purchasing behaviour were conducted with the 14 confirmed outbreak 
cases and 12 revealed consumption of strawberry ice 
cream during the incubation period. Out of these, nine 
remembered the restaurants where they ate the ice 
cream.
Microbiological findings
In Sweden, 17 cases were confirmed by sequencing 
of an overlapping region (692 nt) of the HAV genome 
(VP1/2A; M14707 position 2683–3374), covering the 
460 nt fragment recommended for typing by the global 
HAV network HAVNET [5]. Six cases, from counties B-F,

had not visited the juice bars in county A or other franchisers connected to it (Figure 1); sequencing of those 
cases quickly linked them to the outbreak in county A 
and interviews later confirmed the cases had all consumed strawberries.
In Austria, the 14 confirmed outbreak cases were identified by sequencing the 460 nt fragment as recommended by HAVNET. Phylogeny revealed that all cases 
were genetically 100% identical (Figure 3). 
Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) [6] and 
HAVNET were used to find an indication of the geographical origin of the outbreak strain (MH730560). No 
similar or related sequences were identified in neither 
of the databases. The most closely related sequences 
were involved in an outbreak of HAV in travellers returning from Egypt in 2013 [7,8] and from the HAV outbreak 
affecting the Nordic countries in October 2012–June 
2013, which was likely caused by frozen strawberries 
(Figure 3) [1]. However, the low sequence similarity 
(98%) suggests that there is no relation between these 
outbreaks.
Food investigation and outbreak control
In Sweden, the Environmental Health Offices in counties A and B traced back the origins of the frozen 
strawberries used at the juice bars, the elderly homes, 
schools and at the hotel breakfast buffet (nine locations in total) (Figure 4). Food wholesaler X was identified as a common supplier of frozen strawberries to 
all locations. From wholesaler X, the strawberries were 
traced back through a trader in Sweden who had purchased frozen strawberries from producer Y, residing 
in Poland. Left over strawberries from the wholesaler 
X were found in the freezer in one of the elderly homes 
and were sent in to the NFA. On 26 June, wholesaler 
X initiated the withdrawal of the incriminated batch 
of frozen strawberries from the market. The batch 
was labelled with the best-before date 06 April 2020 
(Environment and Health Administration of Stockholm 
Municipality, Stockholm, personal communication). 
In total, 1,664 packages with 5 kg strawberries each 
(corresponding to 8,320 kg) were withdrawn from the 
Swedish market.
NFA did a laboratory investigation and confirmed the 
presence of HAV in the left over strawberries on 28 
June 2018 by reverse transcription (RT) real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Viral RNA was isolated 
and sequence analysis demonstrated the presence of 
the outbreak strain IB in the strawberries with 100% 
identity (Figure 3). The identification of the outbreak 
strain IB confirms the imported frozen strawberries as 
the common source of this outbreak.
As a consequence of the outbreak, the juice bar chain 
decided to stop using frozen strawberries in their 
smoothies and changed to pasteurised frozen pellets 
of strawberries instead. Staff of the juice bar chain, the 
elderly home and other persons who had contact with 
cases were tested for HAV. Other public health measures included preventive vaccination and administration of gamma globulins.
In Austria, AGES performed an extended trace back 
analysis focusing on the supply of the frozen strawberries used for the production of the outbreak-related 
strawberry ice cream. The same producer in Poland 
that had been identified by the Swedish authorities 
was identified as source of the particular frozen strawberries (Figure 4). Since mid-May 2018, only one wholesaler in Austria has purchased frozen strawberries 
from the producer Y in Poland—these strawberries had 
been further distributed to at least 13 wholesalers, two 
hospital food service kitchens (in Austria), two wholesalers (in Slovakia) and to one ice cream producer (in 
Italy). In total, about 90 restaurants and cafeterias in 
Austria were identified as recipients of frozen strawberries originating from producer Y in Poland (Figure 
4).
Six of these restaurants and cafeterias could be linked 
to eight Austrian outbreak cases, through the consumption of strawberry ice cream during the incubation period. Food samples collected from stored 
packages of frozen strawberries originating from producer Y in Poland (best-before dates 06.03.2020 and 
26.06.2020), tested negative for HAV.
The single Austrian importer of frozen strawberries 
from producer Y, who is expecting a frozen strawberry 
supply of 22 tonnes at the end of 2018, has requested 
evidence for a HAV-negative test result of samples from 
the next incoming strawberry supply. Furthermore, the 
Austrian importer has requested a guarantee from the

International enquiry
On 21 June 2018, the PHAS launched an urgent enquiry 
in the European Centre for Disease Prevention and 
Control (ECDC) Epidemic Intelligence Information 
System for Food- and Waterborne Diseases and 
Zoonoses (EPIS-FWD). At that time, nine countries 
reported that they had not observed any HAV infections associated with the outbreak sequence (name 
in EPIS-FWD: ‘SW 18–09763’). The sequence was 
also uploaded and shared on HAVNET. On 27 June 
2018, Stockholm municipal authority sent a notification to the national contact point for the European 
Commission’s Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed 
(RASFF) (Reference number 2018.1813).
On 25 July 2018, Austria reported the first case infected 
with the same genotype IB outbreak strain in EPIS-FWD 
(Figure 1).
Discussion
In Sweden, the incidence rate for hepatitis A infections 
is low with an average of 0.9 cases per 100,000 population per year from 2010 to 2017 (data not shown). 
In 2017, it increased slightly due to the ongoing outbreak of hepatitis A disproportionally affecting men 
having sex with men (MSM) [9-12]. A similar incidence 
rate holds for Austria with an average of 0.8 cases per 
100,000 population per year over the same period; in 
both countries, hepatitis A is a notifiable disease. In 
Sweden, cases fulfilling the European Union (EU) case 
definition for hepatitis A (IgM or HAV RNA positive, with 
clinical criteria of an acute hepatitis) [13] are reported 
to PHAS by clinicians or laboratories via an electronic 
system called SmiNet. Samples are send to PHAS for

typing on a voluntary basis (60–70% of the notified 
cases). In Austria, a case fulfilling the EU case definition is reported by the clinician or diagnosing laboratory to the relevant public health authorities via a 
web-based, case-recording system called “Elektrisches 
Meldesystem” (EMS). Within the described hepatitis A 
outbreak since beginning of August, AGES has implemented an intensified monitoring of cases of hepatitis 
A registered in the EMS. This includes the prompting to 
transfer HAV-IgM positive serum samples of reported 
hepatitis A cases from the primary laboratories to 
the national reference laboratory (Center for Virology, 
Medical University of Vienna) for genotyping.
Hepatitis A virus is transmitted through faecal-oral 
route, via direct person-to-person contact or contaminated food and water [14]. In the current multi-country 
HAV outbreak with a total of 31 confirmed cases so far, 
imported frozen strawberries were identified as the 
vehicle of the outbreak agent. Several large multi-country outbreaks have been reported in the last 5 years 
related to contaminated berries [1-4], demonstrating 
that berries are a common source of contamination 
with HAV and suggesting that they should always be 
considered in HAV outbreak investigations. On 26 July 
2018, almost 2 months after the initial outbreak alert in 
Sweden, Austria reported a case of HAV infection with 
a strain indistinguishable from the Swedish outbreak 
strain, genotype IB. As at 4 October, a total of 14 cases 
fulfilled the definition of a confirmed outbreak case in 
Austria. Due to rapid sharing of the outbreak sequence 
and information on food exposure in the EPIS-FWD 
enquiry from Sweden, strawberry ice cream was identified as the common link among the Austrian outbreak 
cases. Trace back investigations in Austria revealed 
that the respective frozen strawberries were from the 
same producer Y in Poland as the frozen strawberries 
identified as vehicle for the Swedish HAV outbreak.
There are several challenges with HAV outbreaks 
related to berries: first, the trace back can be difficult as berries are typically harvested by one producer, then packed by another food business operator 
whereby batches may then be mixed or split. In this 
outbreak, the country of origin of the strawberries was 
identified to be Poland and the wholesaler in Sweden 
who bought the strawberries acted quickly and withdrew the incriminated batch. Since they were only

distributed to canteen kitchens or large-scale catering 
establishments (not to retail stores), a list of recipients 
was available allowing for fast withdrawal of the strawberries from the market. Nevertheless, frozen berries 
can be stored for a long time in the freezer or end up in 
multiple different dishes (desserts, smoothies, cakes, 
etc.), which can complicate tracing. In Sweden, the fast 
withdrawal together with timely public health measures such as preventive vaccination and administration of gamma globulins to contact persons at affected 
facilities and heating of frozen strawberries contained 
the outbreak. As a result, case numbers were relatively 
small compared with previous reported HAV outbreaks 
related to frozen berries (e.g. 1,803 cases in Italy, 
2013/14) [4].
Although frozen strawberries were also highly suspected during the large HAV outbreak affecting the 
Nordic countries 2012/13, it was not possible to detect 
HAV in any of the strawberry samples [1]. In the current 
outbreak, leftovers from the suspected frozen strawberries in Sweden were sent to NFA and the presence 
of HAV could be confirmed by real-time PCR and Sanger 
sequencing, providing evidence for the source of infection. While being invaluable in tracing the source of 
infections, the molecular detection of viruses in food is 
challenging [15,16]. Reverse transcription (RT) real-time 
PCR is the standard method for monitoring viral contamination in food [17], but strawberries often contain 
inhibitors which cause an inefficient amplification of 
the RNA target sequence [18]. Moreover, the viral load 
in berries is often low and the viral particles have to 
be concentrated before performing RT real-time PCR. 
Many concentration methods are inefficient and may 
cause co-purification of RT and/or PCR inhibitors present in the food sample [19]. These factors in combination can lead to an underestimation of the viral load as 
described for other enteric viruses [20]; false negative 
results are therefore common.
Another point to consider during HAV outbreak investigations is the long incubation period of hepatitis A (up 
to 6 weeks). After such a long time, it can be difficult 
to recall food consumption and collect food leftovers. 
Furthermore, the time from the onset of symptoms to 
a primary diagnosis and the sequence information can 
take several weeks.
This HAV outbreak linked to imported frozen strawberries gives reason to re-evaluate the national recommendations for the handling of frozen berries in 
Sweden. HAV remains infectious during frozen storage and washing with water before consumption has 
limited effects in removing HAV from berries and 
herbs [21]. During the large HAV outbreak due to frozen berries in the Nordic countries in 2012/13, the NFA 
in Sweden recommended to heat frozen strawberries 
before consumption to inactivate enteric viruses. After 
the outbreak, this recommendation was dismissed 
for strawberries. However, the NFA recommends consumers and food business operators to boil frozen, 
imported raspberries due to the risk of norovirus. The 
current outbreak demonstrates that boiling recommendations could be considered for frozen strawberries, or 
all frozen berries as in Denmark, Finland and Norway 
[1]. This recommendation has been also given in the 
current hepatitis A outbreak by the Austrian public 
health authorities.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the combined epidemiological and microbiological investigations and food trace back analyses 
identified frozen strawberries as the vehicle of the 
two-country HAV outbreak. In Sweden, the findings 
led the wholesaler to voluntarily withdraw this product 
from the Swedish market. While there were no further 
reported cases in Sweden since 27 July 2018, the latest outbreak case in Austria occurred in calendar week 
34. Based on findings of the trace back analyses identifying supply of the particular frozen strawberries to 
Slovakia and Italy, occurrence of further cases in other 
European countries is possible. Increasing awareness 
will help to accelerate a fast public health response.
This report highlights the importance of fast collaborations between different agencies, and the crucial role 
of sharing sequencing data of HAV samples between 
European countries. Without the sequence information, 
it would have been difficult to allocate single cases in 
county B-F and cases in Austria to the same outbreak.
