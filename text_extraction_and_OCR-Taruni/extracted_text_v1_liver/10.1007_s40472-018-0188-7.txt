Abstract
Purpose of the Review Machine perfusion (MP) is a novel technology recently introduced in liver transplantation, redefining the
current practice of organ preservation and pushing the limits of high-risk liver utilisation. This review highlights the key benefits
of machine perfusion over conventional static cold storage (SCS), demonstrated in human liver research and clinical transplants.
Recent Findings The first clinical trials have demonstrated both safety and feasibility of MP. The most recent transplant series and
result from a randomised trial suggest the technology is superior to SCS. The key benefits include extended period of organ
preservation, decreased incidence of early allograft dysfunction and reduction of biliary complications. Normothermic liver
perfusion allows viability testing to guide transplantability of the highest-risk organs. This technology also provides opportunities
for therapeutic interventions to improve liver function and quality in organs that are currently declined for clinical use.
Summary Machine perfusion is likely to transform the liver preservation pathway and to improve utilisation of high-risk grafts.

Introduction
A recent report from the British National Health Service identified that 13% of the 1769 patients registered for liver transplantation in the United Kingdom between 2016 and 2017 died
or were removed from the waiting list after becoming too ill for
transplantation [1]. Similar data are reported from many other
countries reflecting that organ shortage in the context of rising
incidence of liver disease is a worldwide phenomenon [2]. To
address shortfalls in supply of standard criteria donors, transplant teams have progressively extended the criteria to accept
marginal, high-risk organs [3]. Such extended criteria donors
(ECD) include donors after circulatory death (DCD), fatty
livers, and organs from donors with higher risk behaviour or
advanced age with multiple comorbidities [3]. ECD grafts are
more susceptible to ischaemic injury and detrimental effects
caused by static cold storage (SCS) and are associated with
an increased rate of early allograft dysfunction,

post-transplant biliary complications and recipient mortality
[4–6]. Consequently, an increasing number of procured livers
are being declined for transplantation [7]. Steatosis is the leading cause worldwide of livers being discarded (40%), followed
by prolonged donor warm ischaemia, poor organ flushing and
logistical reasons [8, 9]. Confronting the ongoing decline of
standard criteria donors, the increased need for transplantation
can be achieve only by more successful transplants from marginal grafts and increased utilisation of high-risk livers [10].
The inferior outcomes of ECD grafts have exposed shortcomings of SCS and directed research towards finding superior means of liver preservation. Following encouraging data
from pre-clinical experiments and breakthroughs achieved in
heart, lungs and kidney preservation, several teams around the
world have reported successful transplantation of
machine-perfused livers, and this promising technology has
attracted the attention of the transplant community worldwide
[3, 11•, 12–14].
Machine liver perfusion has become a rapidly progressing
field. Whilst the initial case series demonstrated the technology
is safe and feasible in standard criteria livers, subsequently conducted randomised trials have evaluated its efficacy on a whole
spectrum of currently utilised organs [11•, 15•, 16, 17•, 18, 19•]
Table 1. In keeping with promising experimental data, the current evidence suggests that machine perfusion (MP) will be
most beneficial when applied to extended criteria livers.
Recently several teams have started programmes to recondition marginal grafts and to explore frontiers of high-risk
organ utilisation. The predominantly used perfusion temperatures are hypothermic (8–12 °C) and normothermic (37 °C),
although sub-normothermic and rewarming alternatives have
been reported [20–22, 23•].
The hypothermic perfusate is similar to conventional cold
storage preservation fluid, and the perfusion technique simpler
and cheaper than normothermic machine perfusion. It does
not pose additional risks of graft loss compared to SCS and
can reveal pre-existing organ damage; however, in a clinical
setting, it does not generate the data necessary to assess liver
function and transplantability [24, 25].
Sub-normothermic perfusion encompasses the temperature
range 12–35 °C, although the majority of experiments were
performed at temperatures close to 21 °C [21, 26, 27]. Whilst
this perfusion modality delivered promising data in
pre-clinical testing, to date, there have not been published data
from clinical use. Several teams have investigated graft
rewarming, gradually increasing the perfusion temperature
from 4 to 21 °C with promising results [22, 28•, 29]. Both
these perfusion approaches achieve a partial recovery of liver
metabolic function with oxygen requirements that can be met
without a dedicated oxygen carrier in the perfusion fluid.
Normothermic machine perfusion of the liver (NMP-L)
requires a blood-based perfusate and preserves the liver in
near-physiological, fully functioning condition, generating
real-time data allowing assessment of its viability [15•, 30,
31]. It can be used as an alternative to SCS and such application has been currently tested in prospective clinical trials
across Europe and North America. NMP-L has arguably the
most potential to minimise any deleterious effects of the cold
ischaemia, but is less flexible, costlier and logistically more
demanding [32]. Liver reconditioning provides a more flexible alternative, commencing the perfusion on its arrival at the
transplant centre. Several groups have used this technique to
resuscitate graft function prior to transplantation, including
our team’s work on viability assessment of declined livers
[15•, 16]. It can be applied selectively to grafts with suboptimal macroscopic appearance or livers deemed too high-risk
for any other reason.
Extending the Liver Preservation Times
The progressive detrimental effect of cold ischaemia on graft
quality is the fundamental limitation of static cold storage.
Shortening cold ischaemic times (CIT) to the bare minimum
has become a key aspect of successful utilisation of extended
criteria organs and many more livers could have been used
had the organ arrived to the transplanting centre earlier [33].
The benefit of machine perfusion on removing the constraints
due to CIT has previously been shown in the first-in-man
NMP-L series where the longest preservation time was close
to 19 h [11•].
Subsequently, the first randomised trial comparing NMP-L
with SCS performed by the Consortium for Organ Preservation
in Europe (COPE WP2 trial, ISRCTN 39731134) identified that
clinicians started to exploit this logistic advantage, and livers in
the NMP-L group were preserved for significantly longer compared to SCS (11 h 39 min vs 7 h 21 min, p < 0.01). Despite this,
the organs suffered from less early allograft dysfunction (12.6 vs
29.9%; p = 0.002; Nasralla et al., data presented at the British
Transplant Society Congress in 2017). Recently, Watson et al
reported successful implantation of an extended criteria donor
liver 26 h after procurement; in this example, NMP-L was used
to assess the organ and the transplant was deferred until
extra-hepatic malignancy in the recipient was excluded [34•].
This case report highlights the logistical advantages of NMP-L
and the differences in specification of available devices in terms
of the maximum liver preservation times [11•, 15•, 30, 35].
Liberation from the CIT constraints might redefine multiple aspects of current liver transplant practice in the future, including
new opportunities for supra-regional graft sharing and
super-urgent allocation, transformation of donor—recipient
matching or streamlining operating theatre logistics and transplant teams’ workforce management.
The limits of extending the NMP-L preservation are yet to
be defined, though experimental work has demonstrated successful perfusions beyond 24 h [34•, 35–37]. Whilst 24 h
114 Curr Transpl Rep (2018) 5:113–120

preservation would be sufficient to achieve significant improvements in organ sharing and transplant logistics, machine
perfusion may preserve livers for significantly longer. Several
research groups have reported experiments with 72-h canine
and porcine liver perfusions [36, 38]. The prolonged perfusion
will undoubtedly impose new challenges to overcome. For
example, red blood cells (RBCs) have clear biophysical limitations when exposed to sheer stress from the circuit tubing
and abrasive mechanical insult from centrifugal or roller
pumps, leading to an unavoidable degree of haemolysis
[39]. To address the problem, our team investigated the feasibility of replacing RBCs with an acellular haemoglobin-based
oxygen carrier (HBOC), Hemopure, in a human model of
NMP-L. Our results demonstrated similar metabolic and flow
parameters, whilst the HBOC-perfused livers extracted more
oxygen than those perfused with RBCs (O2ER 13.75 vs
9.43% × 105 per gram of tissue, p = 0.001) without increased
apoptosis or necrosis, tested in vitro hepatic cell lines [32].
Exploring strategies to maintain prolonged perfusion will
clearly require intensive research to optimise the perfusate
composition and device design, but achieving this goal will
open new possibilities for using machine perfusion as a tool
for therapeutic intervention and regeneration of the
highest-risk liver grafts.
Pushing the Limits of High-Risk Organ
Utilisation
While the initial series of machine perfused transplants included essentially standard criteria organs, the technology’s
greatest benefit is preservation of marginal livers [40].
Guarrera et al. applied hypothermic perfusion to 31 extended
criteria livers donated after brainstem death (DBD) and, despite their model not providing the organs with oxygen, the
authors observed a decreased rate of biliary complications and
hospital stay compared to matched SCS controls [19•].
Compelling data were reported by the Zurich group using
hypothermic oxygenated perfusions (HOPE) of DBD livers
[41]. Consequently, Dutkowski and colleagues achieved
nation-wide adoption of HOPE by the Swiss healthcare for
all DCD livers, utilising these marginal organs with superior
outcomes. Comparison of their results with matched controls
from the Netherlands and UK demonstrated the incidence of
non-anastomotic biliary strictures in 25 HOPE-perfused livers
compared to 50 SCS matched DCD transplants was significantly lower (0 vs 22%, P = 0.015), together with superior
1-year graft survival (90 vs 69%, P = 0.035) [17•]. Most recently, the data from the COPE WP2 multi-centre European
study enrolling 272 donors (consisting of 194 DBD and 78
DCD organs) showed significantly lower organ discard rate in
the normothermic arm (NMP-L 16 vs SCS 32 livers; p = 0.01;
Nasralla et al., data presented at the British Transplant Society
Congress in 2017). The data regarding biliary complications
and survival at 6-months from this trial are not yet available
Table 1.
The development of normothermic perfusion enabled objective assessment of the liver function, advancing the graft
selection process, and several teams researched the development of criteria for viability assessment including perfusate
pH, bile production, transaminase levels or lactate clearance.
Through pre-clinical experiments, our team observed a
close relationship between liver function and perfusate lactate
metabolism. The organs able to achieve lactate clearance below 2.5 mmol/L within 120 min of commencing perfusion
retained physiological perfusate acid base milieu and did not
require any interventions to maintain extended perfusion.
Transforming the observations into clinical practice, we proposed composite criteria, based on the lactate clearance and
bile production in combination with vascular flows and macroscopic appearance [16]. These were applied on a pilot series
of six livers declined for transplantation by all the UK transplant centres and subjected to normothermic perfusion. The
study enrolled four DCD and two DBD grafts, commencing
perfusion after a period of CIT ranging from 387 to 474 min
[15•]. The liver viability was assessed within a 2-h window,
and five of the organs met the criteria and were successfully
transplanted. In all recipients, we observed immediate graft
function recovery with a short hospital stay, and normalised
liver function tests within the first post-transplant month [15•].
We have consequently conducted the VITTAL clinical trial
(VIability Testing and TrAnsplantation of discarded donor
Livers; NCT02740608), further testing the boundaries of the
highest-risk organ utilisation by criteria principally based on
lactate metabolism, extending the assessment period up to 4 h.
NMP-L provides the opportunity to explore multiple parameters relevant to liver function, and it is still to be determined which can best predict post-transplant outcomes. The
Cambridge group advocated graft assessment based on the
perfusate transaminases and bile pH [42]. The authors observed a significant correlation between the alanine transaminase (ALT) in the perfusate measured after 2 h perfusion and
the peak ALT post-transplant levels within the first week [42].
In this report, Watson et al. also hypothesise that the liver
capacity to produce an alkaline bile (pH > 7.4) might be a
marker of good cholangiocyte function, possibly allowing selection of organs with a low risk of developing intrahepatic
cholangiopathy. If validated, this observation might revolutionise DCD liver utilisation, preventing futile transplantation
of grafts with a limited life span. We expect that future organ
functional assessment will include more sophisticated
methods and markers based on perfusate omics or
microRNA analyses [43, 44].
Although the viability testing data have already shown
benefits of NMP-L in high-risk graft utilisation and reduced
risk of early graft failure, the evidence that MP improves
Curr Transpl Rep (2018) 5:113–120 115

long-term transplant outcomes is still elusive. A pertinent cohort in which to study this subject are DCD livers. To date, the
only clinical evidence comes from retrospective observations
published by the Zurich and Groningen groups [17•, 41, 45•].
The experimental evidence from normothermic perfusion
suggests a protective effect of peri-biliary glands [46–48]. The
evaluation of the biliary complication data from the
randomised COPE trials is eagerly awaited.
New Frontiers and Therapeutic Interventions
during Machine Perfusion
Designing a machine perfusion clinical trial powered to demonstrate differences in post-transplant graft or patient survival
is very challenging, and researchers often use a validated surrogate endpoint as a substitute. A difference in the
post-transplant transaminase levels or incidence of delayed
graft function have often been used, or markers proving less
ischaemia-reperfusion injury which has been a reported
endpoint with many MP series [11•, 15•, 17•, 28•, 40, 49].
The circulating perfusate in the liver itself prevents accumulation of succinate and other metabolic products and removes
the debris and necrotic or apoptotic cells, likely decreasing the
post-reperfusion transaminases and having a beneficial effect
on the graft [19•, 50]. The major benefit is, however, the
oxygenation preventing the damage caused by ischaemia
and anaerobic metabolism [50]. The pre-clinical research
gathered mechanistic evidence of multiple aspects of cellular
metabolism pathways influenced by machine perfusion with
several teams focused in particular on energy metabolism and
mitochondria function [51]. The HOPE perfusion was shown
to induce mitochondrial function with down-regulation of the
respiratory rate, associated with adenosine tri-phosphate synthesis. Such 60 to 120-min duration perfusion achieves recovery of the liver energy resources together with prevention of
mitochondrial reversal flow of electrons during the organ
re-warming, decreasing production of reactive oxygen species
mitigating activation of the inflammatory processes involved
in the reperfusion injury [52, 53].

Despite an extensive knowledge on a cellular level of the
mechanisms of hepatic function protection during HOPE,
NMP-L has the advantage of allowing the exploration of
targeted therapeutic interventions analogous to conventional
medical approaches. For example, to combat the anticipated
risks of bacterial contamination and overgrowth, antibiotics
are universally added to the normothermic perfusate fluid
composition [30, 32]. Targeted antibiotics added to the perfusate for livers from positive culture donors might be an easy
intervention to improve transplantability of organs from donors with infections. A proof of concept with NMP-L antiviral
pre-treatment during machine perfusion in a porcine model
was recently reported by the Toronto group [54]. The same
group also explored strategies to further enhance the protective MP mechanisms in a sub-normothermic porcine DCD
liver model, enriching the perfusate with anti-inflammatory
drugs (alprostadil, n-acetylcysteine, carbon monoxide and
sevoflurane). This intervention significantly lowered the perfusate levels of aspartate aminotransferase, interleukin 6, tumour necrosis factor alpha and galactosidase, and increased
interleukin 10 levels compared to the untreated controls.
Machine perfusion itself reduces activation of the
post-reperfusion inflammation cascade, and despite the improvements in reperfusion injury markers not achieving statistical significance, this concept to enhance the protective mechanisms merits further research [52, 53].
Another frequent reason for discarding donor livers is a
suboptimal flushing. Addition of a thrombolytic agent together with the standardly included heparin might improve graft
circulation without increasing the bleeding risks for the organ
recipient [31, 55].
Steatotic livers are the largest group of poorly utilised
organs, and resuscitation of fatty livers is an important
goal whilst combating the growing obesity epidemic
[56]. The concept of pharmacological intervention to reverse steatosis during NMP-L has been explored by several teams including our own. We performed NMP-L on
severely steatotic donor human livers, exposing the organs to a combination of de-fatting drugs. We observed
solubilisation of the liver fat, commencing within 3 h, and
continuing until the end of 24-h perfusions (unpublished
data). Although it is unclear whether removal of fat from
a viable liver during NMP-L would be relevant in improving its post-transplant function and outcome, the treated
organs showed significantly better metabolic parameters
compared to matched controls, and the histological improvement became apparent after only 6 h. A potential
shortfall of machine perfusion with metabolically active
livers might be re-circulation of harmful or toxic metabolites [57]. In the described experiment the mitochondria
fatty acids β-oxidation increased ketone production and
continuously increased the perfusate apolipoprotein and
cholesterol levels. Removal of the metabolism
by-products from the device circuit is an interesting issue
requiring more research.
The perfusion model of steatotic livers also demonstrates
that different graft categories may benefit from different machine perfusion modalities. Cooling the hepatic fat leads to
changed lipid consistency, increasing its droplet volume
which ultimately compromises the liver microcirculation.
The optimal strategy to minimise any post-procurement damage might be minimising exposure to the cold by normothermic preservation. Following a period of SCS, however, the
disturbed hepatic microcirculation makes subsequent machine
resuscitation and perfusion processes challenging and the optimal temperature and combination of different approaches is
yet to be determined.
The feasibility of the therapeutic interventions discussed
has been demonstrated by animal or proof of concept human
research. In the near future, MP will be studied as a method to
deliver cell-based and small molecule therapies, aimed at improving the condition of high-risk liver grafts, following the
emerging evidence showing efficacy of these novel concepts
in promoting organ regeneration [58–61].
Conclusion
Machine perfusion is a rapidly progressing field which is
likely to change multiple aspects of liver preservation and
transplantation practice in the future. This superior organ
preservation mode has already shown benefits by enabling
functional liver assessment with normothermic perfusion or
reduction of non-anastomotic biliary strictures by hypothermic perfusion. Machine perfusion looks likely to set new
limits for organ preservation times, increase utilisation of
the highest-risk DBD grafts and improve long-terms outcomes in DCD livers. The perfusion procedure will provide
an opportunity for liver regeneration and therapeutic intervention. Different type of livers may benefit from different
perfusion strategies or their combination.
