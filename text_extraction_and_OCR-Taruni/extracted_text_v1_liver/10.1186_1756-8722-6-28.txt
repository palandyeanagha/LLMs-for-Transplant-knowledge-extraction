Abstract
The definition of immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP) as a peripheral blood platelet count less than 100 × 109/L instead
of the historical criteria of 150 × 109
/L renders subjects with platelets between 100 and 150 × 109/L without a
diagnosis. Here, we demonstrated that these subjects have enhanced levels of proinflammatory cytokines linked to
Th1 and Th17 cell response, and are more frequently carriers of polymorphisms in genes that code cytokines
involved in the commitment of Th1 and Th17 immune response, when compared with controls, similarly to that
observed in patients with ITP.

To the editor
According to the International Working Group consensus
panel [1], primary Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP) is
defined as a peripheral blood platelet count less than
100 × 109
/L in the absence of any obvious cause of
thrombocytopenia. The recommendation of this value as
the threshold for diagnosis of ITP, instead of the historical
criteria of 150 × 109
/L, was first proposed by Rodeghiero
et al. [2] based on the results of Stasi et al. [3] showing
that healthy individuals with incidentally discovered platelet count between 100 and 150 × 109
/L have a 10-year
probability of developing persistent thrombocytopenia of
only 6.9% and of developing autoimmune disorders other
than ITP of 12%. However, in addition to the fact that this
criterion has not been formally validated yet [4], patients
with platelet count between 100 and 150 × 109
/L remain
without a diagnosis [5]. Recently, our group evaluated the
serum cytokine profile of 98 patients with chronic ITP
(platelet less than 100 × 109
/L) [6] attending the University
Hospital, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Brazil
and demonstrated higher levels of Th17 cell-related
cytokines, in addition to Th1-associated cytokines in the
patients than in blood donor controls. We have also demonstrated [7] that IL1RN VNTR and IL2-330 allele polymorphisms were associated with increased concentrations
of IL-1β and of IL-2, respectively and were risk factors for
chronic ITP. In this study, we compared serum Th1 and
Th17 cytokine profile of 28 individuals (13 female and 15
male, mean age 49.2 years, range from 19 to 79 years) with
persistent borderline thrombocytopenia with that of
chronic ITP patients and controls we have previously evaluated [6]. None of the included individuals had obvious
predisposing conditions or factors associated with
thrombocytopenia. The platelet count of the subjects
ranged from 101 to 138 × 109
/L with a mean (±SD) of 120
(±10) × 109
/L and the duration of the thrombocytopenia
varied from one to 12 years with a mean (±SD) of 4.7
(±3.6) years. The serum cytokine concentrations (picogram per milliliter, pg/mL) were assayed in duplicate by
ELISA (Biosource, Camarillo, CA). This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Institution and informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Data were
analyzed with SPSS software package version 17.0 (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL) and as the data showed significant departures from normality even after log transformation,
comparisons among the groups were done by the two-

tailed Mann-Whitney U-test. The level of significance was
set at p ≤ 0.05.
Of note, the cytokine profile of the studied individuals
with platelet count between 100 and 150 × 109
/L did not
differ from that of ITP patients we have previously studied [6] (IL-17A: 165.0 vs. 169.0 pg/mL, p = 0.55; IL-1β:
2.9 vs. 3.5 pg/mL, p = 0.40; IL-6: 11.9 vs. 14.0 pg/mL,
p = 0.32; IL-23: 22.6 vs. 17.7 pg/mL, p = 0.10; IL-2: 18.7
vs. 17.3 pg/mL, p = 0.71; IFN-γ: 23.4 vs. 24.7 pg/mL,
p = 0.84; and IL-12p70: 9.0 vs. 7.3 pg/mL, p = 0.46, respectively), but was significantly different from the cytokine profile observed in the healthy blood donors
(Figure 1). A 6.3-fold increased serum level of IL-17A,
the signature pro-inflammatory cytokine of the Th17
cell, and a 2.5-, 5.0-, and 85.6-fold increased of IL-1β,
IL-6 and IL-23, Th17-associated cytokines (p < 10-3 for
all) were observed in the studied group when compared
with the control group (Figure 1). Upregulation of the
Th1 cytokines characterized by increased levels of IL-2
(6.3-fold increased, p < 10-3), IL-12 p70 (31.0-fold increased, p < 10-3) and IFN-γ (2.8-fold increased,
p = 0.001) were also observed (Figure 1). Also, the patients with ITP and individuals with platelet count between 100 and 150 × 109
/L did not differ in respect to
the mean age (p = 0.32), gender (p = 0.20) and duration
of thrombocytopenia (p = 0.82). Here we also reanalyzed
the data of cytokine gene polymorphisms of 122 patients
with platelet count bellow 150 × 109
/L published elsewhere [7] by stratifying the group into those with platelet count less than 100 × 109
/L and those with platelets
between 100 and 150 × 109
/L. The presence of at least
one allele 2 of IL1RN and one G polymorphic allele of
IL2-330 was more frequently observed in the group of
subjects with platelet count between 100 and 150 × 109
/L
(p = 0.04 and p = 0.03, respectively) than in the controls,
as well as in the patients with platelets less than 100 ×
109
/L (p = 0.007 and p = 0.02, respectively) than in the
controls, but they did not differ between the patient
groups (p = 0.8 and p = 0.7 for IL1RN and IL2 polymorphisms, respectively). The polymorphisms were associated with enhanced concentration of IL-1β (6.3 vs.
2.5 pg/mL, p = 0.002) and IL-2 (22.8 vs. 14.9 pg/mL,
p = 0.02) in the IL1RN*2 and IL2-330G carriers, respectively, in the group of subjects with platelet count
between 100 and 150 × 109
/L. Also, in the patients with
platelet count less than 100 × 109
/L, increased serum
concentrations of IL-1β (6.3 vs. 2.8 pg/mL, p < 10-3) and
IL-2 (22.6 vs. 14.8 pg/mL, p < 10-2) were observed in the
carriers of IL1RN*2 and IL2-330G polymorphic alleles,
respectively. In conclusion, individuals with platelet
count between 100 and 150 × 109
/L have enhanced
levels of proinflammatory cytokines linked to Th1 and
Th17 cell response, and are more frequently carriers of
polymorphisms in genes that encode cytokines involved
in the commitment of Th1 and Th17 immune response,
similarly to that observed in patients with chronic ITP,
which points to the need of a careful follow-up of this
group of individuals and to search for pathogenic mechanisms associated with this condition.
