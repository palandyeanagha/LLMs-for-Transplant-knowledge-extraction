Abstract
Background: Community-acquired (CAP) and nosocomial pneumonias contribute substantially to
morbidity and hospital resource utilization. Hyponatremia, occurring in >1/4 of patients with CAP,
is associated with greater disease severity and worsened outcomes.
Methods: To explore how hyponatremia is associated with outcomes in hospitalized patients with
pneumonia, we analyzed a large administrative database with laboratory component from January
2004 to December 2005. Hyponatremia was defined as at least two [Na+] < 135 mEq/L within 24
hours of admission value.
Results: Of 7,965 patients with pneumonia, 649 (8.1%) with hyponatremia were older (72.4 ± 15.7
vs. 68.0 ± 22.0, p < 0.01), had a higher mean Deyo-Charlson Comorbidity Index Score (1.7 ± 1.7
vs. 1.6 ± 1.6, p = 0.02), and higher rates of ICU (10.0% vs. 6.3%, p < 0.001) and MV (3.9% vs. 2.3%,
p = 0.01) in the first 48 hours of hospitalization than patients with normal sodium. Hyponatremia
was associated with an increased ICU (6.3 ± 5.6 vs. 5.3 ± 5.1 days, p = 0.07) and hospital lengths
of stay (LOS, 7.6 ± 5.3 vs. 7.0 ± 5.2 days, p < 0.001) and a trend toward increased hospital mortality
(5.4% vs. 4.0%, p = 0.1). After adjusting for confounders, hyponatremia was associated with an
increased risk of ICU (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.20–2.08), MV (OR 1.75 95% CI 1.13–2.69), and hospital
death (OR 1.3, 95% CI 0.90–1.87) and with increases of 0.8 day to ICU and 0.3 day to hospital LOS,
and over $1,300 to total hospital costs.
Conclusion: Hyponatremia is common among hospitalized patients with pneumonia and is
associated with worsened clinical and economic outcomes. Studies in this large population are
needed to explore whether prompt correction of [Na+] may impact these outcomes.
Background
Community-acquired (CAP) and nosocomial pneumonias represent a substantial burden to the US healthcare
system. CAP alone is responsible for over 1 million hospital admissions annually [1] and $4.4 billion in hospitalization costs [2]. In addition to CAP, there are nearly

130,000 cases of non-ICU hospital-acquired pneumonia
(HAP) and over 100,000 cases of ICU-acquired pneumonia annually [3], the incremental hospital costs of which
have been reported to range from $5,800 to $20,000 per
case [4-6]. Because of pneumonia's staggering clinical and
economic burden, it is important to identify and fully
understand all modifiable factors that influence its hospital course.
Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte imbalance
seen in clinical practice [7]. It also frequently accompanies
pulmonary diseases, both infectious and neoplastic [8]. In
mixed patient populations, others have documented that
hyponatremia adversely affects clinical outcomes [9].
With respect to pneumonia, a recent single-center cohort
study found the incidence of hyponatremia at hospital
admission among CAP patients to be 28% [10]. Importantly, the presence of hyponatremia was associated with
not only prolongation of hospitalization (HLOS), but
also an increase in hospital mortality.
To extend our understanding of the epidemiology and
outcomes of hyponatremia at the time of hospitalization
among subjects with pneumonia, and to clarify the association of hyponatremia with the measures of hospital
resource utilization, such as the need for mechanical ventilation (MV) and the need for and LOS in the ICU, we
conducted a large retrospective cohort study. We hypothesized that hyponatremia at admission is associated with
an increased risk of hospital death among patients with
pneumonia and that this condition additionally adds significantly to HLOS and costs.
Methods
No human subjects were prospectively enrolled in the
study, and therefore an independent Institutional Review
Board (Copernicus Group IRB, Research Triangle Park,
NC, USA, #ICO1-08-252) granted an exemption and
waived the informed consent requirement.
Data source description
Data were obtained from Solucient's ACTracker® database,
a sample of hospitals that contribute general dischargelevel information, in addition to specific drug and laboratory information. Approximately 27 hospitals contribute
data at any point in time, with 39 unique hospitals represented over the two-year study period from January 2004
through December 2005. The data source is de-identified
in compliance with HIPPA regulations.
Subjects
We identified persons with pneumonia based on the presence of the International Classification of Disease version
9, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) 3-digit disease code
for the principal discharge diagnosis of pneumonia (ICD9-CM code 486) [11]. We required that patients have at
least one laboratory value for serum sodium [Na+] available during their hospital admission. For those patients
who did not meet the laboratory definition for
hyponatremia (see below), we further required that s/he
have no primary or secondary diagnosis of hyponatremia
(ICD-9-CM code 276.1).
Hyponatremia definition
Hyponatremia discharges were required to have an admission [Na+] below 135 mEq/L on the first or second day of
admission. To improve specificity for the diagnosis, we
defined hyponatremia to be present if there was at least
one additional [Na+] below 135 mEq/L within 24 hours
of the admission value. We did not specifically seek to
exclude pseudohyponatremia.
Outcomes
Hospital mortality served as the primary study outcome;
vital status was determined based on the presence of a
hospital discharge disposition of "Died". Because it may
be related to severity of illness, we secondarily examined
the relationship of admission hyponatremia and the need
for MV and ICU in the first 48 hours, on LOS in the ICU,
as well as on overall HLOS and incremental hospital costs.
A patient's MV utilization was identified by an ICD-9-CM
procedure code of 96.7 within 48 hours of admission. An
ICU stay was identified by a laboratory test or drug utilization within the ICU in the first 48 hours of admission.
By counting the distinct number of days on which a
patient had a lab test or drug record in the ICU, we derived
the ICU LOS. Costs were estimated using claim charges
and adjusted to 2005 US dollars using the medical component of the Consumer Price Index. These adjusted
charges were then multiplied by the hospital-specific costto-charge ratio, estimated from a Medicare Provider Analysis Review (MEDPAR) file, to yield hospital costs in 2005
US dollars.
Covariates
We examined multiple potential confounders of the outcomes of interest. In all models covariates were age, gender, race, geographic region, teaching status of the
hospital, admission source, principal payer, and DeyoCharlson Comorbidity Index (Deyo-CCI) score [12,13].
The CCI is a score derived from data abstracted from medical records to arrive at a measure of comorbidity burden
[12]. The Deyo-CCI is an adaptation of this method
applied to administrative datasets using ICD-9 codes to
generate a comorbidity score [13]. The hospital cost and
LOS models adjusted for the additional covariates of mortality and ICU and MV stay in the first 48 hours, while the
ICU LOS model adjusted for mortality and MV stay in the
first 48 hours.

Statistical analyses
All of the covariates were examined in univariate analyses
comparing their prevalence among those with and without hyponatremia. We subsequently adjusted our estimates of the impact of hyponatremia on the outcomes of
interest by entering them into multivariable regression
models. All unadjusted between-group comparisons were
performed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test or Median
score test for continuous variables, and the chi-square test
for categorical variables. We used generalized linear models (GLM) to estimate the costs and LOS (both hospital
and ICU) that were attributable to hyponatremia in this
population, adjusted for covariates. Costs were log-transformed due to the skewed distribution of medical expenditures, and the negative binomial distribution was used
to model LOS to account for overdispersion. Logistic
regression modeling was performed to estimate the excess
risk of MV and ICU need, as well as for hospital mortality,
conferred by hyponatremia. Covariates were included in
these models based on previous evidence of associations
with the outcomes or on biologic or clinical plausibility of
such an association. Goodness of fit for these models was
assessed using the scaled deviance and Pearson's chisquare statistic. For all analyses, statistical significance was
reached when a two-tailed p-value was less than 0.05.
All analyses were performed using SAS 9.1.3 (SAS Institute, North Carolina).
Results
Of the 198,281 patients in the database, 7,965 (4%) had
been diagnosed with pneumonia and met the inclusion
criteria, and of those 5,916 had complete cost data.
Patients with pneumonia were 45% male, 85% Caucasian, had a mean age of 68.4 ± 21.6 years, and a mean
Deyo-CCI (13) of 1.6 ± 1.6. Eight percent (n = 649) of the
entire pneumonia population had evidence of
hyponatremia.
The baseline characteristics by hyponatremia status are
shown in Table 1. Patients with hyponatremia were more
likely to be older, and had a greater burden of comorbid
illness as signified by a higher Deyo-CCI. There were no
gender or racial differences between the groups. Patients
with pneumonia who also had hyponatremia were more
likely to be at a teaching hospital than at a non-teaching
facility.
Hospital mortality, though low in both groups, was
greater among patients with hyponatremia (5.4% vs.
4.0%). This difference, however, only approached statistical significance (p = 0.099) (Table 2). The proportion of
patients requiring MV (3.9% vs. 2.3%, p = 0.014) or any
ICU admission (10.0% vs. 6.3%, p < 0.001) was significantly higher in the hyponatremic than the normonatremic group. Hyponatremia also was associated
with increased ICU LOS, and HLOS. Reflecting this, hospital costs were higher among those with hyponatremia
(Table 2). Thus, aggregate median hospital costs exceeded
$7,000 in the population with hyponatremia compared
to $5,732 in persons with no hyponatremia at admission.
When the relationship of hospital mortality with
hyponatremia was examined in a multivariable logistic
regression, adjusting for age, gender, race, geographic
region, teaching status of the hospital, admission source,
principal payer, and Deyo-CCI score, we observed that
hyponatremia was associated with a trend towards an
increase in the risk of hospital death (adjusted odds ratio

1.75, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.69) and ICU care (OR 1.58, 95%
CI 1.20 to 2.08) within 48 hours of hospital admission
were elevated in the group with hyponatremia as well
(Figure 1). Hyponatremia was also found to contribute on
average 0.8 (95% CI -0.25 to 2.04) and 0.3 (95% CI 0.01
– 0.69) days excess in ICU and HLOS, respectively (Table
3). The marginal hospital costs associated with
hyponatremia were $1,324 (95% CI $98 to $2,682)
(Table 3). Both the scaled deviance and Pearson's chisquare statistic for these models were close to one, indicating an excellent model fit.
Discussion
We have shown that hyponatremia frequently accompanies hospitalization for pneumonia. Our findings further
confirm the independent influence of hyponatremia on
hospital length of stay. In addition, we have shown that
hyponatremia exerts a negative impact on multiple outcomes such as the need for MV and ICU care, as well as the
duration of ICU stay. Financially, hyponatremia adds over
$1,300 to the costs of care.
Previous investigations found that hyponatremia in association with a severe Legionella pneumonia requiring an
ICU stay is a strong independent predictor of mortality
[14]. However, only one prior cohort study from a single
institution evaluated the relationship between
hyponatremia and outcomes among all patients hospitalized with CAP [10]. In this prospective cohort study, performed between 2002 and 2005, Nair and coworkers
found the prevalence of hyponatremia, defined as [Na+] <
135 mEq/L in the first hospital-obtained sample, to be
28% among 342 patients enrolled in the study. Although
hyponatremia was mostly mild, the investigators found
an increase in crude HLOS of 2.3 days and a near tripling
of hospital mortality among hyponatremic patients when
compared to those without hyponatremia. After adjusting
for covariates, the presence of hyponatremia was associated with a 7% (p = 0.03) increase in the risk of hospital
death.
Our study, although finding a lower prevalence of
hyponatremia, adds to this earlier work. First, by employTable 2: Hospital outcomes of pneumonia patients by hyponatremia status

ing a more restrictive definition, we confirm the general
impact of hyponatremia on multiple outcomes and help
clarify the importance of this factor. We further extend the
earlier work in that our data derive from a larger and more
generalizable multi-center cohort of patients with pneumonia. Simply put, with a sample size more than ten-fold
greater we were able to explore more precisely the impact
of hyponatremia on economic outcomes and measures of
resource use. The lack of effect of hyponatremia on mortality likely reflects the overall low rate of mortality in our
cohort. Reliance on a more stringent definition of
hyponatremia may have also contributed to this discordant finding regarding mortality. Since we required a second [Na+] measurement, patients with hyponatremia at
admission who died prior to having a second [Na+] drawn
are by definition not included in our mortality analysis.
Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, ours is the first
study to show an association of hyponatremia with such
important components of the hospitalization as the need
for MV and the need for and LOS in the ICU, as well as to
derive hospital costs attributable to hyponatremia.
Pneumonia is an important driver of healthcare costs. The
full burden of hospitalization with pneumonia in the US
approaches 1.5 million cases annually and its economic
impact may be close to $8 billion [1,2,4-6] in hospital
costs alone. Although the majority of patients with CAP
are treated in the outpatient setting, hospital-based management is responsible for over 90% of the costs of care
for this disease [2]. Several risk stratification algorithms,
such as CURB, CURB-65 and Pneumonia Severity Index
(PSI), have been developed to help identify patients at
high risk of CAP-related complications, and to make
appropriate site-of-care decisions [15-17]. The more
detailed 20-point PSI containing points for hyponatremia
([Na+] < 130 mEq/L) has been found to be better than
CURB or CURB-65 at identifying low-risk CAP patients,
and thus more helpful at avoiding potentially costly and
unnecessary hospitalizations [18]. However, the simplicity of both of the CURB instruments makes them attractive bedside clinical tools. The current study gives rise to
the possibility that predictive abilities of the CURB instruments may benefit from the addition of the initial [Na+]
value without compromising its simplicity.
Along similar lines, and once the decision to admit to the
hospital has been made, attention to modifiable determinants of hospital outcomes becomes a critical component
of care in patients with pneumonia. As an illustration, a
randomized controlled trial showed that a simple intervention consisting of making sure that a CAP patient is sitting out of bed or ambulating for at least 20 minutes
during the first 24 hours of hospitalization cut the average
HLOS fully by 1 day without an increase in adverse events
[19]. Approaches like this demonstrate that identification
of and attention to important determinants of outcomes
can result in substantial gains in those outcomes. By
defining the marginal contribution of hyponatremia to
the HLOS and associated costs, our study provides further
evidence that hyponatremia needs to be evaluated as a
potential target for intervention among hospitalized
patients with pneumonia.
Although somewhat novel among patients with pneumonia, hyponatremia has been identified as a predictor of
hospital outcomes in other populations. For example,
among patients with heart failure there is a well-recognized inverse relationship between admission [Na+] and
hospital mortality [20,21]. A recent large cohort study of
nearly 50,000 patients with acutely decompensated heart
failure reported the prevalence of hyponatremia (defined
as admission [Na+] < 135 mEq/L) of 20% and noted that
there is a 20% increase in the risk of hospital death for
each 3 mEq/L decrease in [Na+] below 140 mEq/L; admission hyponatremia was also independently associated
with increased HLOS [22]. Chua et al., in a cohort of 103
geriatric hospitalized patients in the United Kingdom
found an 18% prevalence of hyponatremia ([Na+] < 135
mEq/L) and a similar association between hyponatremia
and outcomes [23]. Contrary to these observed associations, Brouwer and coworkers, while finding a high prevalence of admission hyponatremia (30%), did not
uncover any influence on the outcomes among patients
hospitalized with community-acquired bacterial meningitis; HLOS, however, was not examined [24]. To sum up,
the preponderance of evidence points to a significant
association between the presence of hyponatremia at
admission and worsened outcomes. The current study furthers this evidence base to the hospitalized population
with pneumonia and additionally demonstrates that
hyponatremia impacts every component of the aggregate
hospital outcomes.
Our study has several important limitations that should
be acknowledged. Firstly, because of its observational
nature, the crude associations between hyponatremia and
outcomes are likely confounded. Notably, we have
attempted to address this limitation by performing multivariable analyses. However, the possibility of residual
confounding remains. Secondly, by virtue of its retrospective design, the study is prone to several forms of bias.
Thirdly, the fact that the data source is not clinical but
administrative in nature makes our case definition prone
to misclassification. Although the presence of laboratory
data and our stringent definition of hyponatremia eliminated that as a limitation of exposure classification, the
definition of pneumonia was somewhat less precise, as it
relied on the presence of the corresponding ICD-9-CM
code. Conversely, our stringent definition of
hyponatremia may have itself resulted in an immortal

time bias, such that our current estimate of mortality rate
among hyponatremic patients is an underestimate of the
actual risk of death. That is, by excluding cases without a
confirmatory [Na+] value we may have eliminated a substantial number of patients with hyponatremia who died
prior to having the opportunity to have had the second
[Na+] checked. As far as the diagnosis of pneumonia, misclassification remains a potential concern, though, if
present, it is most likely non-differential leading the estimated associations to appear less strong. Along the same
lines, it is also possible that at least some of the included
patients were actually misclassified cases of congestive
heart failure. Though our dataset precludes us from confirming or refuting its presence, this misclassification is
not unusual in clinical practice, and thus should not
detract from the relevance of our estimates. Finally, we
have not attempted to separate our cohort by the origins
of pneumonia (e.g., CAP vs. HAP). Although of importance for future investigations, our aim for the current
analysis was to answer a more general question of what
role hyponatremia may play in any patient with an infection of the lower respiratory tract, regardless of its etiology.
Conclusion
In summary, we have shown that hyponatremia is common among hospitalized patients with pneumonia and
independently associated with worsened clinical outcomes, as well as with an increase in the utilization of MV,
ICU and hospital resources. Future research needs to focus
not only on how hyponatremia may affect subpopulations of patients with pneumonia, but also how severity of
hyponatremia impacts hospital outcomes. Most importantly, studies are needed to evaluate the role of currently
available therapies aimed at correction of hyponatremia
in improving the outcomes of patients with pneumonia.
