Abstract
Inhibition of the sodium–glucose cotransporter (SGLT) 2 in the proximal tubule of the kidney has a broad range of effects on
renal function and plasma volume homeostasis, as well as on adiposity and energy metabolism across the entire body. SGLT2
inhibitors are chiefly used in type 2 diabetes for glucose control, achieving reductions in HbA1c of 7–10 mmol/mol (0.6–0.9%)
when compared with placebo. This glucose-lowering activity is proportional to the ambient glucose concentration and glomerular
filtration of this glucose, so may be greater in those with poor glycaemic control and/or hyperfiltration at baseline. Equally, the
glucose-lowering effects of SGLT2 inhibitors are attenuated in individuals without diabetes and those with a reduced eGFR.
However, unlike the glucose-lowering effects of SGLT2 inhibitors, the spill-over of sodium and glucose beyond the proximal
nephron following SGLT2 inhibition triggers dynamic and reversible realignment of energy metabolism, renal filtration and
plasma volume without relying on losses into the urine. In addition, these processes are observed in the absence of significant
glucosuria or ongoing natriuresis. In the long term, the resetting of energy/salt/water physiology following SGLT2 inhibition has
an impact, not only on adiposity, renal function and blood pressure control, but also on the health and survival of patients with
type 2 diabetes. A better understanding of the precise biology underlying the acute actions of SGLT2 inhibitors in the kidney and
how they are communicated to the rest of the body will likely lead to improved therapeutics that augment similar pathways in
individuals with, or even without, diabetes to achieve additional benefits.

Introduction
Inhibitors of sodium–glucose cotransporter (SGLT) 2
have a wide range of clinically relevant actions in those
with type 2 diabetes. Although SGLT2 inhibitors are
primarily indicated as glucose-lowering agents, the consequences of reducing the renal threshold for glucosuria
extend beyond simply reducing plasma glucose levels.
Most attention has focused on the pleiotropic effects of
SGLT2 inhibitors on cardiac function and their potential
benefits with regards to heart failure and mortality rates.

In this review, we examine the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on glucose metabolism and also explore their
glucose-independent actions on adiposity, renal function
and blood pressure. These additional actions are clinically important as most individuals with type 2 diabetes
struggle to reduce or maintain their weight, at least every second patient has chronic kidney disease (CKD)
and the majority of people with type 2 diabetes also
have hypertension. Consequently, an intervention that
reduces hyperglycaemia, aids weight loss and blood
pressure control, and modulates kidney function has an
important place in the management of type 2 diabetes.
SGLT2 inhibitors and glucose control
SGLT2 inhibitor therapy in type 2 diabetes reduces plasma
glucose levels proportional to the ambient glucose concentration and the glomerular filtration of this glucose. In clinical
trials, SGLT2 inhibitors are associated with a reduction in
HbA1c by 7–10 mmol/mol (0.6–0.9%) vs placebo, regardless
of background therapy [1]. This finding is similar in magnitude to results with other oral glucose-lowering agents.
However, owing to elevated glucosuria and hyperfiltration,
greater reductions may be seen in patients with poor
glycaemic control, potentially to a greater extent than with
other agents [1]. As most clinical studies have been performed
in participants with poor glycaemic control, it is often suggested that add-on therapy to SGLT2 inhibitors has superior
efficacy compared with SGLT2 inhibitor monotherapy [2].
However, smaller reductions in HbA1c following SGLT2 inhibitor treatment are observed in participants with better control at baseline, especially at a low dose [3–5], and these reductions may be less than those with use of other agents for
which the mechanism of action is not glucose-dependent.
SGLT2 inhibitors reduce fasting plasma glucose (FPG)
concentrations by 1–2 mmol/l, a greater reduction than that
achieved with other glucose-lowering strategies [1]. This apparent advantage may partly reflect the marked elevation of
FPG in patients with poor glucose control [6] and the greater
glucosuria achieved following SGLT2 inhibitor therapy in this
setting. SGLT2 inhibitors also reduce postprandial glucose
levels and improve markers of blood glucose viability [7, 8],
consistent with their mechanism of action.
The glucose-lowering effect of SGLT2 inhibitors is dosedependent, at least in patients with HbA1c <64 mmol/mol
(8%), in whom high-dose therapy produces superior glucoselowering compared with low-dose formulations [1]. In those
with poor glucose control, however, improvements in
glycaemic control are statistically similar with both high- and
low-dose SGLT2 inhibitors. This reflects the pharmacodynamic actions of SGLT2 inhibitors: the modest additional reduction in the threshold for glucosuria achieved by high-dose vs
low-dose formulations is most apparent when glucose filtration is closest to this threshold, and least apparent in patients
with a very high HbA1c, in whom the filtered glucose load
greatly exceeds the absorptive capacity for glucose. As a
corollary, the preferred strategy is to initiate patients with poor
glucose control with low-dose formulations of SGLT2 inhibitors, escalating to higher doses as clinically indicated; although
this approach remains to be formally studied. In patients with
only moderately elevated glucose levels, initiating treatment
with high-dose formulations may be more appropriate for facilitating early efficacy and reinforcing ongoing adherence.
Interestingly, the SGLT2 inhibitor canagliflozin (300 mg) has
been associated with modestly greater effects on HbA1c and
FPG compared with other SGLT2 inhibitors [1]. This is possibly due to its inhibitory actions on SGLT1 in the intestine [9]
and activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) [10],
but also the higher dose used compared with other SGLT2
inhibitors. However, no head-to-head trials directly comparing
individual SGLT2 inhibitors have been conducted to date.
Finally, the glucose-lowering effect of SGLT2 inhibitors
also depends on the renal filtration of glucose; at the same
ambient glucose levels, individuals with a high eGFR filter
more glucose into their primary urine than those with a lower
eGFR [11]. This further explains the greater degree of
glucosuria seen with SGLT2 inhibitors in those with poor glucose control, as glucose-mediated hyperfiltration and ambient
hyperglycaemia in these individuals combine to increase glucose filtration by the kidneys. By contrast, the glucoselowering effects of SGLT2 inhibitors are attenuated in patients
with eGFR <60 ml min−1 [1.73 m]−2 and almost absent when
eGFR is <30 ml min−1 [1.73 m]−2 [11]. Hence, the use of
SGLT2 inhibitors for glucose-lowering is not recommended
or contraindicated in individuals with renal impairment. To
maximise glucose-lowering effects in individuals with an
eGFR <60 ml min−1 [1.73 m]−2
, initiating treatment with a
high-dose formulation of an SGLT2 inhibitor may be preferred.
Glucose lowering with SGLT2 inhibitor use is independent of
insulin The urinary excretion of glucose induced by SGLT2
inhibitors does not require insulin, so SGLT2 inhibitors also
exert glucose-lowering effects in type 1 diabetes. Moreover, in
type 2 diabetes, insulin requirements are modestly reduced
following SGLT2 inhibition [12], while glucosuria and improved insulin sensitivity as a result of SGLT2 inhibition also
causes a modest fall in endogenous insulin secretion [8, 13]
(Fig. 1). Whether this reduced workload also preserves beta
cell function beyond amelioration of glucose toxicity and peripheral insulin resistance remains to be established. However,
the long-term sustainability of the glucose-lowering effects of
SGLT2 inhibitors appears to be better than with sulfonylureas
[14], with which beta cell exhaustion, as well as nonadherence due to hypoglycaemia or weight gain, often leads
to a progressive loss of glycaemic control.

Acute changes in glucagon, glycogen and gluconeogenesis
The loss of glucose into the urine following treatment with
SGLT2 inhibitors triggers several compensatory pathways
(Fig. 1). There is a rapid early increase in plasma glucagon
following SGLT2 inhibitor use [13], likely arising from a reduction in (inhibitory) paracrine signalling within the islet, as
well as central signals triggered by falling glucose levels.
SGLT2 inhibitors may also act directly on alpha cells, at least
in vitro and at high doses, to reduce SGLT1-dependent glucose
uptake and promote glucagon release [15]. The resulting reduction in insulin:glucagon ratio triggers an increase in hepatic
glucose production (HGP), mediated by glycogenolysis and
subsequently gluconeogenesis [13]. Over time, the demand
for increased glucose production is supplanted by other metabolic compensations and glucagon, hepatic glycogen and HGP
return to normal [16]. Initiation of a low-carbohydrate diet induces similar dynamic metabolic changes. However, renal gluconeogenesis is also modulated following SGLT2 inhibition
[17] and this may affect glucose control in the post-absorptive
state, as gluconeogenesis-derived glucose is normally provided
in almost equal amounts by the proximal tubule and the liver.
Chronic shifts in metabolic substrate utilisation and ketogenesis Depletion of liver glycogen [18, 19], and other signals
that increase HGP following SGLT2 inhibition (Fig. 1),
modulates the uptake and utilisation of glucose in peripheral
tissues. Together, these actions protect the brain’s glucosedependent metabolism. Indeed, in this context SGLT2 inhibition may induce a state that is considered as ‘pseudofasting’. As in the fasting state, any unnecessary utilisation
of glucose is limited via increased peripheral oxidation of
fat [20] due to increased lipolysis and NEFA uptake from
the circulation. At the same time, NEFA is used by the liver
to generate ketones, which can act as an alternative and
efficient energy substrate for metabolism, and may be preferred by some tissues, such as the heart [13]. Unlike the
transient changes in glucagon and HGP, the contribution of
lipolysis and ketogenesis to overall energy metabolism
strengthens with ongoing SGLT2 inhibitor treatment [13].
SGLT2 inhibition is also associated with changes in amino
acid utilisation (as an alternative energy substrate) and protein catabolism (to provide amino acids) [21], although lean
mass is not lost with SGLT2 inhibition.

Fig. 1 The nexus of metabolic changes contributing to reduced plasma
glucose and adiposity following inhibition of SGLT2. SGLT2 inhibitor
treatment triggers a reduction in insulin:glucagon ratio that increases hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Renal gluconeogenesis is also
modulated by SGLT2 inhibition. The unnecessary utilisation of glucose is
constrained by increased peripheral oxidation of fat facilitated by increased lipolysis in adipose tissue and augmented NEFA uptake from
the circulation. Ketones are also generated by the liver and act as an
alternative and efficient energy substrate for metabolism. Other efficacies
in peripheral energy metabolism are also triggered, including changes in
mitochondrial network homeostasis. SGLT2 inhibition increases hunger
and modulates central regulation of glucose control and adiposity. In
adipose tissue, altered fat utilisation may also reduce inflammation and
augment fat browning. In the long term, there are additional effects in the
pancreas to reduce beta cells stress and improve incretin sensitivity. This

SGLT2 inhibitors and weight control
Most people with type 2 diabetes are obese, overweight or, at
the very least, have increased fat deposition inside and around
their internal organs. This ectopic fat has an important
influence on health, illustrated by the profound effects of
bariatric surgery on glycaemic control, insulin resistance, beta
cell function, dyslipidaemia and hypertension, as well as
broader effects on morbidity and mortality [22]. For overweight or obese individuals, it is widely recommended that
an initial target of losing 5–10% of body weight is appropriate,
with additional targets being set once this initial goal is met.
Meeting these targets is challenging and can be made more
difficult by the competing goal of glucose control and the
addition of glucose-lowering agents that promote weight gain
(e.g. sulfonylureas, insulin, thiazolidinediones). Hence, interventions to produce and sustain significant weight loss as well
as glycaemic control in people with type 2 diabetes are held in
high regard by patients and physicians alike.
Glucosuria and weight loss The presence and severity of
glucosuria is associated with weight loss in people with uncontrolled diabetes. Weight loss is often a presenting feature of
diabetes, alongside polyuria and polydipsia. In the second
century AD, diabetes was described by the Greek physician,
Aretaeus of Cappadocia, as a condition associated with ‘the
wasting of flesh and limbs into urine’. The emaciated condition of people with type 1 diabetes prior to the discovery of
insulin graphically demonstrates this phenomenon. Treatment
with insulin, once it became available, resulted in lowered
glucose levels, dramatic weight/fat gains and restoration of
physical health, mainly due to elimination of glucosuria. In a
seminal study performed in people with type 1 diabetes [23], it
was estimated that 70% of the weight gained following intensive insulin treatment was due to improved renal conservation
of ingested energy. Equally, in a randomised trial of night-time
insulin and morning glipizide use in people with type 2 diabetes, the reduction in glucosuria largely accounted for the
weight gain reported [24]. Moreover, people with type 2 diabetes presenting with little or no glucosuria do not present
with weight loss [25].
SGLT2 inhibitors and energy balance While SGLT2 inhibitors
are not licensed for use in weight loss therapy, it is apparent
that, by promoting glucosuria, they provide an opportunity to
achieve a negative energy balance. Consistent with this, a
large number of clinical trials have reported that SGLT2 inhibitors are associated with a dose-dependent reduction in
body weight [1, 26]. Initial weight loss may be rapid, with
losses of 1 kg being observed within 7 days of starting therapy,
and most studies reporting loss of 2–3 kg over the initial
6 months of treatment. High doses of canagliflozin may induce modestly greater weight loss than other SGLT2
inhibitors [1], possibly due to its additional actions [9, 10]
and the higher dose used. Weight reduction is also greater in
individuals with the highest HbA1c at baseline and is attenuated in those with good glucose control at baseline [27].
This is partly due to the magnitude of glucosuria resulting
from SGLT2 inhibition and its impact on overall energy
balance. In contrast, weight loss does not appear to be associated with baseline BMI, sex, race or background therapy [1].
SGLT2 inhibitors and adiposity Much of the early decline in
body weight with SGLT2 inhibitor use follows depletion of
hepatic glycogen and associated water loss. In the longer term,
SGLT2 inhibitor-induced weight change mainly results from
loss of fat mass, including reductions in steatosis and visceral
and subcutaneous adipose tissue [28], mediated by enhanced
fatty acid release from adipocytes to meet the demands for
increased fatty acid oxidation (as detailed above). The potential for SGLT2 inhibition to specifically reduce hepatic fat
accumulation, especially in individuals with fatty liver
disease, remains under investigation. Increased fat use following SGLT2 inhibition could reduce hepatic fat stores.
However, this may be offset by improved hepatic insulin sensitivity and increased uptake of NEFA liberated by peripheral
lipolysis. Increased fat utilisation in white adipose tissue
following SGLT2 inhibition may also reduce inflammation
within fat and augment fat browning [29] (Fig. 1).
Why isn’t weight loss greater or ongoing following SGLT2
inhibitor use? A daily loss of 60–80 g glucose into the urine
every day equates to an energy loss of 1000–1300 kJ (230–
310 kcal) per day, similar to that expended by running for
30 min each day. An individual with diabetes whose weight
is stable (i.e. energy intake is equal to energy expenditure)
beginning SGLT2 inhibitor treatment, might therefore be expected to generate a negative energy balance of 1000–1300 kJ
(230–310 kcal) per day, and lose ∼7 kg in body weight over
6 months if this negative balance were continued. However,
the actual weight lost following SGLT2 inhibitor therapy is
less than half this amount. Moreover, although clinical studies
with SGLT2 inhibitors demonstrate an acute decline in body
weight [1, 26], a nadir is reached after approximately 6 months
and ongoing weight loss is not observed despite ongoing
glucosuria and associated energy losses. This pattern implies
that energy loss must be initially partly, and eventually fully,
offset by other factors, as ultimately a new energy balance and
stable weight is reached.
It has been suggested that SGLT2 inhibition may increase
hunger (Fig. 1) [30], especially for sugar-rich foods [31], in a
manner similar to exercise, low-carbohydrate diets and newonset diabetes. Theoretically, a modest increase in energy intake may not balance initial heavy glucosuria, resulting in
early weight loss with SGLT2 inhibitor use. However, as
glucosuria declines with improving glucose control, (lesser)
Diabetologia (2018) 61:2098–2107 2101

energy losses may become fully offset by increased food intake, achieving a new energy balance and plateau in weight.
Surprisingly, this would not require a large increase in energy
intake—just the equivalent of one (1200 kJ) muffin extra
every day, and such small dietary changes may be easily
missed. At the same time, increased dietary adherence, such
as that achieved when adopting a new diet, may help promote
additional weight loss when starting SGLT2 inhibitor
treatment, although caution is required with very-lowcarbohydrate diets to prevent excessive ketogenesis.
People that adopt a low-carbohydrate diet experience an
early increase in resting energy expenditure, almost half of
which is due to the energy demands of gluconeogenesis
[32]. This extra energy expenditure potentiates acute weight
loss. By contrast, long-term adherence to a low-carbohydrate
diet may be associated with a depressed metabolic rate [33] as
energy-demanding gluconeogenesis is normalised and other
energy-efficient compensations take over. These include
changes in substrate utilisation, mitochondrial network homeostasis and downregulation of mammalian target of
rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)-dependent pathways. One
can speculate that similar changes occur following SGLT2
inhibition as well [21], whereby in the short term, glycogen
depletion and enhanced energy-dependent HGP drive early
weight loss. However, as gluconeogenesis normalises [16],
hepatic glucagon receptors are downregulated [34] and
energy-saving efficiencies are brought into force; a new steady
state (weight) is reached with lower total energy expenditure,
balancing ongoing energy losses associated with glucosuria.
Weight loss in people with CKD It is widely regarded that
glucosuria, and its associated energy losses, is the primary
driving factor for weight loss following SGLT2 inhibition.
However, in people with reduced eGFR, impaired glomerular
filtration of glucose reduces SGLT2 inhibitor-induced
glucosuria, yet weight loss still occurs [11]. Hence, it is not
simply the magnitude of glucosuria, but the magnitude of
glucosuria per nephron, that potentially triggers feedback signals that initiate lipolysis and weight loss. However, the
mechanisms that underlie this feedback pathway remain to
be fully elucidated.
SGLT2 inhibitors and renal function
Proximal tubular sodium handling The glomeruli of the human kidney filter 400–600 g of sodium from the plasma every
day; the proximal tubule subsequently reabsorbs between 60
and 80% of this. SGLT2 plays a small but significant role in
this process, reabsorbing one Na+ ion for every glucose molecule from the lumen of the early proximal tubule. In the late
proximal tubule, the high-affinity/low-capacity SGLT1 reabsorbs two Na+ ions for every glucose molecule but this
pathway is underused in the healthy kidney as >90% of the
filtered glucose is reabsorbed via SGLT2. Overall, ~25 g of
sodium (alongside ~180 g of glucose) is reabsorbed by SGLTdependent pathways in the proximal tubule each day,
amounting to 4–6% of the total filtered sodium load [35].
In diabetes, glucose-mediated renal hypertrophy, increased
expression and activity of SGLT2 and full recruitment of
SGLT1 mean that almost 50 g of sodium (over 10% of the
filtered sodium load) may be reabsorbed via SGLT-dependent
pathways [35]. Enhanced proximal sodium reabsorption
strongly affects energy-dependent sodium transport further
along the nephron, which is strongly impacted by sodium
delivery to each segment. Of note, increased sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule causes reduced sodium uptake at
the macula densa (Fig. 2), activating tubuloglomerular feedback pathways to reduce synthesis of vasoconstrictive molecules, leading to augmented renal plasma flow and increased
intraglomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure (PG) [36]. The
‘vacuum effect’ of enhanced proximal tubular sodium absorption also reduces the hydrostatic pressure in Bowman’s space
(PBow) [37, 38]. The higher pressure above and lower pressure
below the filtration surface creates a pressure gradient (i.e.
increased PG − PBow), so the filtration rate in each nephron
(single-nephron GFR [SNGFR]) increases (Fig. 2).
SGLT2 inhibition has the opposite effect. Sodium and glucose that is not absorbed proximally via SGLT2 passes distally. Sodium and glucose retrieval by SGLT1 in the S2/3 segments of the proximal tubule partly compensates for this,
albeit at limited capacity. In addition, Na+
/H+ exchanger-3
(NHE3)-dependent sodium uptake may also fail to compensate following SGLT2 inhibition [38], possibly due to overactivity of SGLT1. Together, these changes result in increased
delivery of sodium to the macula densa, triggering a fall in PG
following SGLT2 inhibition [38–41]. Simultaneously, the
osmotic effect of glucose and sodium also increases PBow to
further reduce transglomerular pressure (PG − PBow) and
SNGFR.
SGLT2 inhibition and solute handling In diabetes, energydependent sodium and glucose reabsorption in the proximal
tubule increases hypoxia in the renal medulla, contributing to
nephron dropout and functional decline. The high energy demands of the proximal tubule also make it sensitive to imbalances between renal oxygen delivery and oxygen consumption. This vulnerability is best illustrated by acute kidney injury
(AKI), which occurs following volume depletion and is more
common and severe in those with diabetes. By transferring
some of the energy burden of sodium reabsorption away from
the proximal tubule, SGLT2 inhibitors may protect against
AKI. Indeed, in the Empagliflozin, Cardiovascular Outcome
Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients (EMPA-REG
OUTCOME) study [42], the incidence of AKI was lower in
participants receiving empagliflozin when compared with
2102 Diabetologia (2018) 61:2098–2107

placebo. However, volume depletion following SGLT2 inhibitor use may precipitate AKI in some settings [36, 43].
The sodium and glucose not absorbed in the proximal
tubule following SGLT2 inhibition also influences solute
handling elsewhere in the nephron. This distal shift in sodium
reabsorptive burden following SGLT2 inhibition may increase
medullary oxygen demand [44], possibly driving compensatory erythropoietin production (Fig. 2) [45]. In diabetes, however, erythropoietin production fails to increase despite renal
hypoxia [46].
Tubular glucose can also be exchanged for uric acid by
luminal GLUT9, which becomes more active in the presence
of glucosuria [47]. The resulting uricosuria may explain the
decline in plasma urate levels observed with SGLT2 inhibitor
therapy [48]. Equally, SGLT2 inhibition is also associated
with a reduction in phosphate clearance due to increased
activity of the Na+
/PO4
3− cotransporter, leading to a 3–5%
increase in serum phosphorous and compensatory effects on
parathyroid hormone, fibroblast growth factor 23 and vitamin
D [49]. SGLT2 inhibition has no direct impact on potassium
homeostasis. The incidence of hyperkalaemia was reduced by
SGLT2 inhibitor (empagliflozin) use in the EMPA-REG
OUTCOME trial; although this was not observed in the
Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study (CANVAS)
[42, 50], possibly reflecting differences in incident renal impairment between the two trial cohorts (Fig. 3).
SGLT2 inhibitors and kidney function Realignment of renal
sodium handling following SGLT2 inhibition is associated
with a modest acute reduction in eGFR of 3–4 ml min−1
[1.73 m]−2 [42, 50, 51]. This occurs after a single dose, persists with chronic dosing and is rapidly reversible after discontinuation of therapy [42]. Notably, a fall in eGFR following
SGLT2 inhibitor use is also observed in individuals with

Fig. 2 Physiological mechanisms implicated in changes in renal function
following inhibition of SGLT2. (a) Natriuresis activates tubuloglomerular
feedback, which decreases PG and increases PBow, thereby reducing the
transcapillary pressure gradient, GFR and albuminuria. The natriuretic
effects of SGLT2 inhibitors are also associated with a sustained contraction in plasma volume and enhanced distal delivery of solutes to medullary nephron segments. Increased energy requirements for solute reabsorption are offset by a compensatory increase in erythropoietin production, which raises the haemoglobin concentration. Finally, SGLT2 inhibition is also associated with suppression of tubular injury pathways, and
reduced circulating and tissue markers of inflammation and oxidative
stress in experimental models. (b) Glucosuria is associated with improved
glycaemic control and weight loss. (c) Sodium and glucose loss in urine
may reduce proximal tubular ischaemia. This may also affect energy
utilisation pathways in the medulla, thereby increasing erythropoietin
production to enhance renal oxygen delivery. DCT, distal convoluted

diabetes but without overt hyperfiltration, poor glycaemic
control or CKD or, even, in those without diabetes altogether
[45, 52], suggesting it is not merely an outcome of improved
diabetic state or correction of hyperfiltration, or mediated by
glucosuria.
SGLT2 inhibitors are also associated with a rapid reduction
in urinary albumin excretion, independent of glycaemic
effects [53]. It is likely that the reduction in PG − PBow, which
acutely reduces the eGFR, also reduces albuminuria [42, 53].
However, other changes in tubular endocytosis arising from
changes in flow, intraluminal pressure or contact time with the
primary urine following SGLT2 inhibition may also modulate
handling of filtered protein in the proximal tubule (Fig. 1).
Long-term treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors is also associated with reduced progression of albuminuria and slower
decline in renal function when compared with placebo [42,
50, 51]. Again, this appears to be independent of improvements in blood glucose levels, weight or blood pressure and
occurs in individuals with and without CKD [53].
Although the number of renal events was small, fewer participants receiving SGLT2 inhibitor therapy (vs placebo) in the
EMPA-REG OUTCOME study and CANVAS experienced
doubling of serum creatinine, incident dialysis, renal transplantation and/or renal death (Fig. 3) [42, 50]. In addition,
the Canagliflozin and Renal Endpoints in Diabetes with
Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE)
study (ClinicalTrial.gov registration no. NCT02065791) was
stopped prematurely due to clear benefits towards the primary
composite endpoint of doubling of serum creatinine, incident
dialysis, renal transplantation, renal or cardiovascular death.
SGLT2 inhibitors and blood pressure control
Most people with type 2 diabetes have hypertension or require
antihypertensive therapies to control blood pressure. Current
guidelines recommend achieving a target blood pressure of
<140/90 mmHg [54] to prevent micro- and macrovascular
complications, disability and death [55]. However, lower targets may be appropriate for individuals with, or at high-risk of,
cardiovascular disease or CKD [54].
Although not indicated as an antihypertensive agent, treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors is associated with sustained lowering of systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 4–6 mmHg
and 1–2 mmHg, respectively [1, 56]. This reduction is observed in hypertensive and non-hypertensive individuals, regardless of background therapy, although the reduction may
be greater in the former due to increased sodium/volume sensitivity in people taking vasodilators (rendered sodium/volume
sensitive by sustained vasodilatation) [56]. A reduction in
blood pressure is also observed in individuals with reduced
eGFR [11], even though the glucose-lowering efficacy of
SGLT2 inhibitors is attenuated in this setting. Furthermore,
reductions in blood pressure with SGLT2 inhibitor use are also
observed in renal transplant recipients, arguing against a direct
neurogenic mechanism (as a transplanted kidney is denervated) [57]. Finally, a reduction in blood pressure is observed
regardless of glucose control in both individuals with and
without diabetes [45, 52], arguing that it does not represent
reversal of renal or vascular pathology, at least in the short
term. The most likely mechanism for the acute fall in blood
pressure following SGLT2 inhibitor therapy is a sustained reduction in plasma volume (Fig. 2).
SGLT2 inhibitors and plasma volume Plasma volume is tightly
controlled and rapidly recovers from imposed alterations
through modulation of compensatory pathways. For example,
a 5% reduction in plasma volume can activate the sympathetic
nervous system and the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, and suppress natriuretic peptides, resulting in overall
promotion of sodium and water reabsorption in the kidney
and restoration of plasma volume. Increases in plasma osmolality also mobilise fluid into the extracellular space.
SGLT2 inhibitors cause an acute contraction in plasma
volume within hours of therapy initiation, manifested by a
3–7% increase in haemoglobin, albumin and urea concentrations. Unlike other causes of plasma volume loss, that induced
by SGLT2 inhibitors continues, even over years of therapy
[42]. The underlying mechanism is not merely natriuresis, as
the natriuresis associated with SGLT2 inhibition is modest
when compared with conventional diuretics and is transient
(24 h sodium excretion returns to pre-treatment levels within
days, despite ongoing treatment) [58]. Nor is it dependent on
the osmotic diuretic effects of glucosuria, since similar changes in plasma volume are observed in SGLT2 inhibitor-treated
individuals without diabetes, and those with a reduced eGFR,
despite minimal glucosuria [11, 45]. It is likely that, following
SGLT2 inhibition, the osmotic effect of glucose and increased
sodium flow beyond the early proximal tubule, are interpreted
by the nephron as signs of excessive filtration, such as may
occur following inappropriate expansion of plasma volume or
sodium loading. However, plasma volume and sodium are not
elevated. In fact, total body sodium is actually diminished
following SGLT2 inhibition [59]. Nonetheless, these signs
trigger homeostatic changes as if they were, including resetting of a new (reduced plasma volume) steady state.
Conclusions
The spillover of sodium and glucose beyond the proximal
nephron following SGLT2 inhibition triggers a dynamic and
reversible realignment of energy metabolism, renal function
and plasma volume. These acute changes have consequences
for the health and survival of people with type 2 diabetes. The
outcomes from recent cardiovascular safety studies in
2104 Diabetologia (2018) 61:2098–2107

participants with cardiovascular disease support this assertion
[42, 50]. However, the much longer-term benefits of SGLT2
inhibitor use arising from improved glycaemic control, beta
cell preservation, and reductions in adiposity, blood pressure
and plasma volume, as well as better preservation of renal
function may prove equally important and more broadly
applicable.
Unlike the glucose-lowering effects of SGLT2 inhibitors,
effects on weight, renal function and plasma volume do not
rely on ongoing losses into the urine, and occur in the absence
of significant glucosuria [11] or ongoing natriuresis [58].
Subtle changes in the solute/water/energy balance in the proximal tubule following SGLT2 inhibition cause the kidney to
take control of a perceived imbalance, modulating not only
eGFR and plasma volume, but also metabolic processes
across the entire body. A better understanding of the precise
biology underlying the acute actions of SGLT2 inhibitors in
the kidney and how these are communicated to the body will
likely lead to improved therapeutics, augmenting similar pathways in people with, and even without diabetes, to achieve
augmented benefits.
