Abstract
Introduction Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is
described as a decrease in platelet count associated with
heparin administration and is an immune-mediated adverse drug
reaction that can cause both arterial and venous thromboses. It
can be a life-threatening complication of heparin exposure. Little
data concerning incidence, predisposing factors, or outcome in
critically ill surgical patients are available.
Methods All critically ill, postoperative patients admitted
between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2001, to a
surgical intensive care unit (SICU) who tested positive by an
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the HIT antibody (HPIA;
Diagnostica Stago, Inc., Parsippany, NJ, USA) were identified.
Patient risk factors and outcomes were abstracted
retrospectively from the medical record and compared with
those from control patients matched for age, gender, diagnosis,
severity of illness, and date of SICU admission.
Results Two hundred and ten patients out of 2,046 patients
(10%) admitted to the SICU had HIT assays performed.
Nineteen patients (0.9% of admissions; 9% of tested
individuals) had positive tests. HIT-antibody-positive patients,
compared with 19 matched controls, had an increased risk of
death or major thrombotic complications (37% versus 10%; P
< 0.05) and prolonged length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay
(20 days versus 10 days; P < 0.05). Exposure to heparin via
intravascular flushes alone was sufficient to generate HIT
antibodies in 12 of 19 (63%) patients. Five patients received
platelet transfusions after the diagnosis of HIT was known; four
of these patients died.
Conclusion Heparin flushes were the most common cause of
HIT in this study. HIT-antibody-positive patients had an
increased risk of death or major complications and a prolonged
length of ICU stay. Platelet transfusions often were administered
despite a positive HIT test result and were associated with a
high mortality rate. Treatment algorithms that minimize exposure
to heparin and contraindicate platelet transfusions merit further
study.
Introduction
Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) (type II) is a potentially life-threatening complication of heparin exposure. It is
defined as a decrease in platelet count associated with
heparin administration in patients with detectable HIT antibodies. It is one of the most common immune-mediated adverse
drug reactions, with 1% to 3% of all patients receiving unfractionated heparin at therapeutic levels (4 to 14 days) developing HIT [1]. It may develop sooner in patients who have
previously received heparin [2]. The platelet count will usually
decrease below 100 × 109 per liter or 50% of the baseline
value and then return to normal after the heparin is discontinued, usually within 7 to 10 days [3]. Many patients develop
arterial or venous thrombosis. Arterial thrombosis most commonly affects the cerebral or large lower limb vessels, presenting as thrombotic stroke or acute limb ischemia. Venous
thrombotic complications, in particular proximal deep vein

thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, are common sequelae
of HIT [2].
Extensive literature exists documenting the prevalence and
clinical significance of HIT in hospitalized populations [1-5].
Seroconversion is extremely common (51% of patients) after
cardiac bypass surgery, but the occurrence of thrombocytopenia and thrombotic complications is relatively uncommon [6-
8]. Among critically ill surgical patients, in whom exposure to
heparin is commonplace, there are limited data concerning the
incidence, risk factors, and outcome of HIT. What has been
demonstrated in the hospitalized population is a higher incidence of HIT in surgical patients than in medical patients and
that heparin administered intravenously in large doses and for
an extended period increases the risk of HIT [9,10]. Case
studies have also demonstrated the probability of developing
HIT with minimal heparin exposure via intravascular flushes to
maintain patency of indwelling arterial or venous catheters
[11-15]. In the current study, the outcomes of mortality, morbidity, length of stay, and platelet transfusions were measured
for frequency among HIT patients and control patients who
had undergone surgery and were exposed to heparin in the
surgical intensive care unit (SICU).
Materials and methods
The study was approved by our Institutional Review Board.
Our hospital's laboratory was used to identify patients who
tested positive for HIT by commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (HPIA; Diagnostica Stago, Inc., Parsippany, NJ, USA) based on a threshold optical density (OD)
measurement that is specific for each test day. All SICU
patients who tested positive for HIT between January 1, 2000,
and December 31, 2001, were enrolled in the study.
To further support the diagnosis of HIT, an objective clinical
probability scoring system was used to retrospectively calculate the likelihood of HIT according to criteria of '4 T' score
developed by the International Society on Thrombosis and
Haemostasis SSC (Scientific and Standardisation Committee) Subcommittee on Platelet Immunology [16,17]. We used
a modified version by Lo et al. [18] in which three clinical probability scores were divided into high (6 to 8 points), intermediate (4 to 5 points), and low (0 to 3 points) groups based on
the final score (Table 1).
All patients had been admitted to the SICU for reasons other
than HIT. The clinical course, risk factors, and outcomes of
mortality, length of stay, morbidity, and occurrence of platelet
transfusions were compared with data derived from control
patients. We matched control patients by gender, similar
admitting diagnosis, age (within 10 years of the HIT-positive
[HIT+] patient), and severity of illness based on Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores taken
on the day of admission to the SICU. Each control patient
resided in the unit within the same time period as the study
patient and was thrombocytopenic.
We hypothesized that heparin exposure, extensive surgical
procedures, large blood loss during surgery, trauma, and bacteremia might be possible risk factors that influence the incidence or outcome of HIT. Through chart review, we compared
these risk factors and the clinical course in both study and
control patients and related them to the occurrence of HIT.
Results and Discussion
During the study period, 2,046 patients were admitted to the
SICU. Of these patients, 210 (10%) had HIT assays performed because of clinical suspicion of HIT. Nineteen patients
(9% of patients tested; 0.9% of admissions) had positive
tests, supporting the clinical diagnosis of HIT. These 19 HIT+

patients were well matched to 19 control patients with respect
to gender, age, admitting diagnosis, and severity of illness
based on APACHE II scores obtained on the day of admission
to the SICU. Their clinical characteristics are listed in Table 2.
The majority of the patients tested for HIT antibodies had a
high positive ELISA OD titer measurement, whereas the four
controls had a negative titer (Table 3).
All controls except two were thrombocytopenic while in the
SICU. The two controls who were not thrombocytopenic did
show a decrease in platelet count of 38% (from 480 to 318)
in one and 7% (from 242 to 226) in the other. Only four controls were tested for HIT antibodies, and the results were negative. When the '4 T' scoring system of Lo et al. was applied
to our HIT patients, four (21%) HIT patients were in the category of 'high' probability and 15 (79%) were in the 'intermediate' category. The 'high' probability scores supported the
clinical diagnosis of HIT. These patients had a greater than
50% decrease in platelet count between 5 and 10 days after
heparin exposure, and all developed a thrombus. The 'intermediate' scores strongly suggested the diagnosis of HIT, but
according to the '4 T' scoring system this cannot be completely definitive, because these patients were also bacteremic, receiving antibiotics, had multiple system organ failure,
and/or experienced postoperative bleeding. These patients
had a greater than 50% decrease in platelet count between
five and ten days after heparin exposure. None of these
patients developed a thrombus, but we did observe platelet
counts returning to normal within ten days after cessation of
heparin, supporting the diagnosis of HIT. When the same
scoring system was applied to the 17 controls who were
thrombocytopenic, they fell into the 'low' probability category,
as did the two controls without thrombocytopenia. Seventeen
controls had a platelet count decrease between 25% and
50% and an onset of three to ten days after heparin exposure.
The controls matched in this study had undergone extensive
procedures and had large blood losses during surgery; this
may be the cause of the low platelet counts. One control died
of coagulopathy after extensive trauma and several surgical
procedures.
Heparin exposure before diagnosis was limited to intravascular 'flush' solutions in 12 of 19 HIT+ patients (and in 11 of 19
controls). Of these 12 HIT+ patients, seven had some previous
exposure to heparin (four prior to the SICU admission and
three from another hospitalization). The remaining five had no
known previous exposure to heparin and received only intravascular flush solutions. The standard flush solution is 1,000
units of heparin in 1,000 ml of 0.45% normal saline. Five units
of heparin are delivered every hour to flush the intravascular
line. An arterial catheter would receive 120 units in the course
of a 24-hour period. A central venous catheter would receive
240 units and a pulmonary artery catheter would receive 360
units in a 24-hour period. The average lengths of stay in the
SICU were 14 days for study subjects and 6 days for the
controls. There was no association between HIT and extensive
surgical procedures, large blood loss or trauma.
Platelet count decreased by 50% or more compared with the
count upon admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) in all 19
patients who tested positive for the HIT antibody. Eleven of the
19 HIT+ patients had a typical onset of thrombocytopenia
occurring four days or more from the initial exposure to heparin
in the SICU. The remaining eight of the 19 HIT+ patients had a
rapid onset of less than four days from the initial exposure to
heparin in the SICU. Normalization of platelet count within ten
days after cessation of heparin was observed in 14 of the HIT+
patients. The remaining five patients expired before their platelet counts could return to normal.
Statistical analysis
We performed an analysis of demographic and clinical factors
and outcome. Normally distributed continuous data are presented as mean ± standard deviation unless otherwise
indicated. Nonparametric data are presented as median ±
95% confidence interval (CI). Bivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the association between outcome variables
and each of the dependent variables. For continuous data,
comparisons between groups were made by unpaired t tests.

Comparisons of discrete dependent and independent variables were performed with the Fisher's exact test, and odds
ratios and 95% CIs were calculated for 2 × 2 comparisons.
Survival analysis was performed by the Kaplan-Meier method.
Results were considered statistically significant at a two-tailed
P < 0.05. NCSS 97 software (NCSS, Kaysville, UT, USA) was
used for all analyses.
Outcomes
The presence of HIT was associated with an increased risk of
death (relative risk 6.0, 95% CI 0.8 to 131.5; P = 0.09) (Table
4). The length of stay in the ICU was doubled for HIT+ patients
compared with controls. Among patients surviving to hospital
discharge, HIT patients had fewer ICU-free days compared
with control patients during the first 28 days. Overall hospital
length of stay was increased in patients with HIT compared
with controls.
Four of 19 HIT+ patients had major thromboses (femoral vein
thrombus, left atrial thrombus, ischemic stroke, and subclavian
vein thrombus). One control patient had a deep venous thrombosis. The presence of HIT was associated with an increased
risk of a combined endpoint of the occurrence of death or
major thrombotic complications (relative risk 4.5, 95% CI 1.1
to 29; P < 0.05).
Twelve HIT+ patients (versus five controls) received platelet
transfusions either during surgery or postoperatively in the
SICU. Five HIT+ patients received platelet transfusions after
the diagnosis of HIT was known; four of these patients died.
Two of the four patients who died were actively bleeding,
which influenced the decision to give platelets. A clear indication for platelet transfusion could not be determined from the
medical record in the other two cases; both had postoperative
complications of sepsis and multiple system organ failure, and
thus we cannot attribute their deaths entirely to HIT and platelet transfusions. Four control patients were tested for HIT antibodies, and the results were negative. All controls except two
were thrombocytopenic while in the SICU, and five received
platelet transfusions. Of these five, one died from coagulopathy and the others did not display any further complications.
Platelet transfusions were administered despite the HIT status
being suspected and confirmed by positive test results. For
several reasons, platelet transfusions are not recommended in
the setting of HIT. First, thrombocytopenia is due to accelerated consumption and not decreased production. Second,
HIT is known to be associated with platelet-based thrombotic
complications. Third, the platelet count is not predictive of the
risk of hemorrhage in patients with HIT; and, fourth, bleeding
complications are rare [19-22]. Nevertheless, in some cases,
our clinicians appeared to react to the low platelet count by
administering platelet transfusions.
Conclusion
The occurrence of HIT after exposure to only small quantities
of heparin has been reported [23-25], but the fact that the
majority of HIT was due to flushes alone was unexpected, as
this was previously believed to be an uncommon occurrence.
Clinicians should consider the occurrence of HIT in patients
who experience a platelet count decrease while receiving
heparin flushes. When thrombocytopenia occurs, heparin from
flushes may not be suspected initially as a cause of thrombocytopenia and may go unnoticed. This oversight may postpone
the treatment of HIT and could result in serious morbidity and
mortality. Heparin should be discontinued if HIT is suspected,
with or without evidence of thrombosis, and alternative anticoagulation should be started [26,27].

Limitations in this retrospective case-control study were
encountered in extracting accurate data concerning previous
heparin exposure from the medical record. Some of the
patients in this study were referred to our institution from other
hospitals. Thus, we did not have access to all previous medical
records and, due to regulations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, could not request the
charts retrospectively. Several of the patients in this study
were trauma patients admitted through the emergency room.
Their complete medical history prior to the emergent admission was unknown. We recorded previous heparin exposure in
our data collection only when it was clearly documented in the
medical records available to us. Another limitation is that control patients did not all receive testing for HIT antibodies even
though they all had a decrease in platelet count and 17 displayed thrombocytopenia. Only four control patients had HIT
ELISAs performed while in the SICU. Patients were otherwise
matched for age, gender, admitting diagnosis, date of admission, and severity of illness based on APACHE II score, however, suggesting strongly that the outcome differences that we
observed were due to the presence of HIT. Of course, the
results of this study cannot be generalized to other populations of patients in other intensive care settings.
As this was a retrospective study, we had only the ELISA test
available to detect HIT antibodies, and this test has a high sensitivity and a relatively low specificity [28]. We were unable retrospectively to perform another test that has higher specificity,
such as the serotonin release assay or the heparin platelet
aggregation test, given that our hospital does not store blood
specimens. Such tests would possibly have provided further
support of the diagnosis of HIT in our cases. The clinical probability scoring system of '4 T' confirmed high probability in four
cases and clinically supported the diagnosis of HIT. Fifteen
cases had scores of 'intermediate,' which strongly suggests
HIT, but other factors such as bacteremia, antibiotics, multiple
organ system failure, and postoperative bleeding may have
contributed to the diagnosis. Retrospectively, if we had been
able to perform another test with high specificity (serotonin
release assay) on these 15 cases to distinguish pathogenic
immunoglobulin G (IgG) class antibodies from nonpathogenic
IgM and IgA class antibodies, we would have additional verification of the diagnosis of HIT.
This study suggests further investigation, including randomized clinical trials of alternatives to standard unfractionated
heparin as intravascular flush solutions in critically ill patients.
Treatment algorithms that would minimize exposure to heparin
(including flush solutions) and algorithms that would prevent
unnecessary platelet transfusions also merit further study. As
a result of this review, we identified two process variables that
could be improved: identification of the patient as HIT+ and
prevention of platelet transfusions among HIT+ patients.

Key messages
• There are little data available in the literature related to 
incidence, predisposing factors, or outcomes in critically ill surgical patients diagnosed with HIT.
• This retrospective observational study examined risk 
factors that might predispose surgical patients to HIT.
• There was no association between HIT and extensive 
surgical procedures, large blood loss, or trauma.
• The study did discover that minimal exposure to heparin 
via intravascular flushes in the majority of the subjects 
was sufficient to generate HIT, and this was previously 
believed to be an uncommon occurrence.
• Lastly, the study showed that platelet transfusions were 
administered in five cases despite the diagnosis of HIT 
being known, which suggests the need for treatment 
algorithms that would prevent unnecessary platelet 
transfusions.
