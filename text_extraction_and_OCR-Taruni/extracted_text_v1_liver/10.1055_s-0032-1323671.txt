tional and unintentional overdose (acute VPA 
intoxications) [ 7 ] .
 Within the normal dose range, VPA is often clinically administered in combination with other 
antiepileptic drugs, antidepressants or antipsychotics. Side eff ects typically evolve acutely, and 
most frequently observed side eff ects include 
fatigue, nausea, vomiting, haemorrhages, seizures, and ataxia. Liver failure, bleeding, and 
 pancreatitis represent rare but life-threatening 
adverse events [ 8 , 9 ] . The severity of hepatotoxicity can range from reversible hepatic dysfunction 
to irreversible liver failure [ 10 ] . Reports of fatal 
liver failure related to VPA monotherapy are 
anecdotal, and systematic analyses of these complications are scarce. Large pharmacovigilance 
studies specifi cally addressing VPA-associated 
hepatotoxicity with both fatal and non-fatal outcome covering children and adults are lacking. 
Bryant and Dreifuss focussed on VPA-associated 
fatalities in the U.S.A. and reported 29 deaths 
identifi ed between 1987 and 1993 [ 11 ] . Koenig 
and co-workers performed a questionnaire-based

Introduction

 Valproic acid (VPA, 2-propylvaleric acid) was fi rst 
synthesised as an organic solvent by the US 
chemist Burton in 1881. Its anticonvulsant properties were recognised incidentally in seizure 
experiments with VPA as a vehicle [ 1 ] . VPA was 
fi rst released in France in 1967 and has been 
approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of epilepsy, bipolar aff ective 
disorder [ 2 ] and migraine and cluster headaches 
 [ 3 ] . Potentiation of GABA-ergic transmission 
by inhibition of GABA transaminase [ 4 ] , direct 
eff ects on potassium channels [ 5 ] , and attenuation of NMDA-receptor-mediated neural excitation [ 6 ] have all been assumed to play a role in 
the neurochemical activity of VPA, whereas the 
mood-stabilising function appears to be related 
to cellular inositol depletion.
 VPA is considered to be safe when administered 
according to the well-established therapeutic 
serum drug level. Nonetheless, Sztajnkrycer 
described 373 cases of major toxicity and 16 
deaths in the USA in the year 2000 after intenAuthors M. M. Schmid 1, *, R. W. Freudenmann 1, *, F. Keller 2, B. J. Connemann 1, C. Hiemke 3, M. Gahr 1, W. Kratzer 4,

Abstract
▼
Introduction: Little is known about hepatotoxicity associated with valproic acid (VPA), a widely 
used substance in neuropsychiatry.
Methods: All reported cases to the German 
Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices 
between 1993 and 2009 of VPA-induced serious 
hepatic side eff ects were evaluated.
Results: A total of 132 cases of serious VPAassociated liver failure were identifi ed. Approximately one third (34.8 %) occurred under VPA 
monotherapy, while the majority was seen with 
VPA plus co-medication, most frequently antiepileptics (34.8 %) and benzodiazepines (16.7 %). A 
subgroup of 34 cases (25.8 %) had a fatal outcome, 
the largest number reported to date. Of these, 
32.4 % were under VPA monotherapy and 67.6 % 
under VPA plus concomitant medication. Within 
the study period a signifi cant increase in the total 
number of reported cases and the subgroup of 
fatal cases was found.
Discussion: This fi rst pharmacovigilance study 
of VPA-associated liver failure indicates a higher 
rate of non-fatal and fatal liver failure when VPA 
is given with co-medication as compared to 
monotherapy. However, co-medication per se 
does not increase the risk of fatalities.

pharmacovigilance study that investigated drug-induced hepatic 
injury in children between 12 and 17 years of age [ 12 ] .
 We set out to study the frequency and risk factors of VPA-associated liver failure in a fi rst pharmacovigilance study using data 
from the German federal authority, irrespective of VPA indication. We sought to determine the roles of the absence or presence of co-medications, gender and age.
Methods
▼
 To investigate VPA-associated liver failure, we analysed all 
reported cases of VPA-associated hepatopathy and liver failure 
in Germany that had been submitted to the responsible federal 
authority, the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical 
Devices (Bundesinstitut für Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte 
[BfArM], UAW Datenbank, Germany), between 1993 and 2009. 
BfArM is responsible for the surveillance of risks due to medical 
products in Germany. Among other functions, BfArM records 
spontaneous reports about serious adverse events from clinicians and gains information through systematic studies of published reports from Germany. Each BfArM report is documented 
in a separate standard form fi lled out by the reporting clinician. 
Each case report about VPA-associated liver failure includes age, 
gender, co-medication, and outcome (fatal vs. non-fatal). Admittance to the data base of cases with VPA-associated hepatotoxicity requires causality classifi ed by BfArM as either “suspected” 
or “possible”. Cases in which a causal relationship between liver 
failure and VPA use was regarded unlikely were not evaluated 
because they are not recorded by the BfArM.
 The cases were analysed irrespective of the indication for administration of VPA or diagnosis and they were studied systematically, regardless of whether they occurred with VPA monotherapy 
or under a regime of VPA plus comedication. In addition, the correlation between occurrence of VPA-associated hepatotoxicity 
and gender or age was assessed. In a second step we evaluated 
the subgroup of fatal VPA-associated liver failures among all 
cases of VPA-induced hepatotoxicity. We calculated the relative 
association (percentage) of VPA-associated liver failure for each 
substance used as a comedication with VPA to establish a rank 
order of risk for the entire set of cases and for the subgroup of 
fatal cases. Additionally, case-fatality rates were determined 
within the medication groups.
 Finally, we evaluated the number of reported cases of VPA-associated liver failure between 1993 and 2009 and divided the 
results in 4 time periods (1993–1997, 1998–2001, 2002–2005, 
and 2006–2009) for all cases and for the fatal cases. The frequencies of reported cases across these 4 time intervals were compared with the chi 2 test assuming an equal distribution over 
time. Furthermore, the association between gender and outcome (non-fatal vs. fatal) was tested for signifi cance using the 
chi 2 test. Age diff erences between the 2 outcome groups were 
tested with the the Mann-Whitney U test.
Results
▼
 A total of 132 cases of serious hepatic adverse eff ects associated 
with application of VPA were reported to the German federal 
authority (BfArM) between 1993 and 2009 ( ●▶ Table 1 , left 
 column); of these, 34 cases had a fatal outcome and this subgroup is further described below ( ●▶ Table 1 , right column).
 The total sample of 132 cases consisted of 76 female and 54 male 
(gender not reported for 2) patients, resulting in a female-tomale ratio of 1.41–1. The median of age was 16.0 years (range 
10 months to 86 years; age not reported for 11).
 In 46 of the 132 cases, hepatic adverse eff ects were reported to 
have occurred under VPA monotherapy (34.8 %), while in the 
majority of the reported cases, VPA was administered with other 
comedication (86 of 132 = 65.2 %).
 Comedications grouped by substance classes are provided 
in ●▶ Table 1 (left column). They came from a wide range of 
 substance groups. In descending order, they were antiepileptics (34.8 %), benzodiazepines (16.7 %), antipsychotics (6.8 %), 
antidepressants (5.3 %), diuretics (6 %), antibiotics (4.5 %), proton 
pump inhibitors (3.8 %), non-steroidal anti-infl ammatory drugs 
(NSAID) (3.8 %), hypnotics (3 %), heparin (2.3 %) and propofol 
(1.5 %). Among all licensed antiepileptics, topiramate, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and ethosuximide showed the highest 
number of serious hepatic adverse eff ects with additional VPA 
medication.
Sub-group with fatal liver failure
 34 out of the 132 patients with VPA-associated liver failure 
deceased during the further course, representing a fatality rate 
of 25.8 % ( ●▶ Table 1 , right column and ●▶ Table 2 for further clinical details). Of these, eleven (32.4 % of all 34 fatal cases) were 
treated with VPA monotherapy, while the remaining 23 (67.6 % 
of all 34 fatal cases) were treated with VPA and various comedications (see ●▶ Table 1 right column for details). The relative 
number of fatal cases was similar in patients with mono-therapy 
(11 out of 46 = 23.9 %) or with combined medications (23 out of 
86 = 26.7 %). A disproportionally high rate of fatal outcomes was

found for propofol (2 out of 2 = 100 %), heparin (2 out of 3 = 66.7 %), 
diuretics (5 out of 8 = 62.5 %), antibiotics (3 out of 6 = 50 %), carbamazepine (5 out of 11 = 45.5 %), and phenytoin (2 out of 
5 = 40 %) ( ●▶ Table 1 ).
 In contrast to a preponderance of female patients in the total 
number of cases, no diff erences in the number of fatal cases 
were found for men and women (17 vs. 17). However, the association between gender and outcome (fatal vs. non-fatal) was 
not statistically signifi cant (chi 2 = 1.36, df = 1, p = 0.244). Regarding age, there was no overall signifi cant diff erence between the 
groups (fatal and non-fatal liver failure) (z = − 1.61, p = 0.106) 
(age not reported for 2 of the fatal cases). When inspecting the 
age distribution of the 2 groups ( ●▶ Fig. 1 ), there seemed to be an 
increased occurrence of serious hepatic side eff ects in children 
under 11 (0–10) years while the number of fatalities seemed 
equally distributed. An exploratory post hoc test of signifi cance 
revealed that children under 11 have a lower risk of fatality (9 
out of 54 = 17 %) as compared to patients with higher age (23 out 
of 67 = 34 %) (chi 2 = 4.79, df = 1, p = 0.029).
Frequency of reported liver failure cases (1993–2009)
 The number of reported cases of VPA-associated liver failure 
between 1993 and 2009 was evaluated. Therefore, all cases and 
fatal cases were subdivided according to the date of report in 4 
time periods: 1993–1997, 1998–2001, 2002–2005, and 2006–
2009. There were 14 reports from 1993 to 1997, 12 reports from 
1998 to 2001, 29 reports from 2002 to 2005, and 111 reports 
from 2006 to 2009. 4 fatal cases were reported between 1993 
and 1997, 2 from 1998 to 2001, 6 from 2002 to 2005, and 22 
cases from 2006 to 2009. The chi 2 test indicated a signifi cant 
increase in both, in all cases (chi 2 = 159.3, df = 3, p < 0.001) and 
the subgroup of the fatal cases (chi 2 = 29.5, df = 3, p < 0.001).
Discussion
▼
 This is the fi rst pharmacovigilance study that evaluated all cases 
of VPA-associated liver failure with fatal or non-fatal outcome 
irrespective of the indication of VPA covering all ages (children 
and adults). Within a total sample of 132 cases of VPA-associated 
liver failure 34 fatalities occurred, representing the largest 
 published sample of fatal liver failure to date [ 11 ] . As compared 
with available studies, our pharmacovigilance study based on 
reported data to the German federal authority between 1993 
and 2009 has a comparatively long observation period of 17 
years (e. g., 7 years in [ 11 ] ).
 Considering the total number of cases with serious hepatic 
adverse eff ects a preponderance of female patients was observed 
resulting in a female-to-male ratio of 1.41–1. Regarding comedication, one third of the hepatic adverse eff ects were reported to 
have occurred under VPA monotherapy, while in the majority of 
the reported cases, VPA was administered with other comedication, most frequently substances with extensive hepatic metabolism such as antiepileptics, benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, 
diuretics, antidepressants and antibiotics. Approximately one 
quarter of patients who developed serious hepatic adverse 
eff ects due to VPA-treatment deceased in the further course 
(fatal VPA-associated hepatotoxicity). This observation showed 
no statistically signifi cant diff erence regarding gender and age of 
aff ected patients. While children under the 11 years of age seem 
to be particularly at risk for developing any serious hepatic AE 
related to VPA this age group might feature a lower risk of fatal 
liver failure. Of the reported fatal cases one third were treated 
with VPA monotherapy, while two thirds received comedication 
in addition to VPA. The relative number of fatal cases was similar 
in patients with monotherapy or with combined medications 
(about a quarter).
 To put our results in a larger perspective, Binek and colleagues 
estimated a risk of 1:5 000 to 1:10 000 of fatal liver failure with 
VPA in adults [ 13 ] . Dreifuss et al. found this risk to be approximately 1 in 37 000 in adults with VPA monotherapy [ 14 ] ; as for 
children between 0 and 2 years old receiving valproate as polytherapy, they found a much higher risk of fatalities (1 out of 500 
cases). A particularly high risk for fatal hepatotoxicity under VPA 
was described for patients on additional antiepileptic drugs, 
with congenital metabolic disorders, with severe epileptic seizures in mental retardation or children, especially those under 
the age of 2 years (Box Warning [ 15 ] ). Thus, the risk of VPAinduced hepatotoxicity in adults without these additional risk 
factors was thought to be defi nitely lower. This is in contrast 
with the study by Koenig et al. who counted 9 fatalities resulting 
from VPA-induced hepatopathy in Germany from 1994 to 2003 
from questionnaires sent to all members of the German section 
of the League against Epilepsy [ 8 ] . They found that 5 out of 9 
reported fatalities occurred in adults and 3 out of 9 patients had 
VPA monotherapy. Hence, this study was not in line with the 
generally accepted concept that VPA-induced hepatopathy 
occurs only in children or adults with risk factors such as polypharmacy [ 11 ] . Bauer et al. even reported a case of fatal fulminant liver failure under VPA monotherapy in a patient with 
bipolar aff ective disorder without any comorbidity [ 16 ] .
 The present study supports the view that VPA hepatotoxicity is 
not restricted to specifi c risk constellations except for age and 
comedication. We found a slightly higher occurrence of nonfatal hepatic injury in children younger than 11 years while the 
risk of a fatal outcome was about 2 times lower than in older 
patients. Otherwise no eff ect of age was observed. The majority 
of VPA-induced liver failure occurs in patients with VPA plus 
comedication. This fi nding is consistent with the earlier assumption that polypharmacy is still an important factor in VPAinduced hepatotoxicity. If comedication was present, substances 
that are extensively metabolised in the liver were found to be

common (see ●▶ Table 1 for details), so that in the presence of 
such substances liver function should be monitored even closer 
than in VPA monotherapy. The observed increase of registered 
cases of serious and fatal hepatic side eff ects over time might be 
explained by either changes in prescription practise or increased 
reporting to the BfArM pharmacovigilance data base.
 We are aware of some limitations of our study. As a pharmacovigilance study, it is retrospective and fully depends on the 
physicians’ reporting discipline (leaving room for an unknown 
number of unreported cases) as well as the quality of the data 
provided. We cannot explain whether the observed increase in 
the occurrence of VPA-associated liver failure depends on a better reporting practice or the increased use of VPA in general. 
 Further, it appears to be possible that comedication was not 
reported in every case, leading to an overestimation of hepatotoxicity in VPA monotherapy. Our study does not allow for 
 drawing either general causality conclusions or aetiological considerations about VPA-related fatalities and fully relies on the 
factors reported to the federal authority such as age, gender and 
comedication. We cannot provide any information regarding the 
time interval between onset of VPA treatment and the development of liver failure because the BfArM data base does not contain usable information for this important question. In addition, 
our German data cannot be generalised for other countries. 
Thus, similar studies in other countries would be desirable.
 Across countries the recommended laboratory function tests 
before and after starting VPA therapy diff er signifi cantly. In Germany, the summary of product characteristics recommends several baseline tests (coagulation parameters including fi brinogen, 
total protein, whole blood cell count, bilirubin, transaminases, 
gamma-glutamyl-transferase, lipase and amylase, and serum 
glucose) and monthly clinical and laboratory controls (transaminases, bilirubin, coagulation parameters and amylase) for half a 
year; in case of pathologies after 4 weeks, 3 further controls with 
a maximum delay of 2 weeks each and subsequent monthly controls until 6 months after initiating VPA treatment should be 
performed [ 17 ] . In children, additional safety measures are recommended (laboratory controls at every second clinical appointment and parent education about signs of liver dysfunction) 
 [ 17 ] . For the United States, the manufacturer recommends that 
“liver function tests should be performed prior to therapy and 
at frequent intervals thereafter, especially during the fi rst 6 
months” (without providing details about the tests and the 
intervals) [ 15 ] . Some authors highlighted that severe VPA-associated hepatotoxicity usually manifests within the fi rst 90 days 
after treatment initiation [ 18 ] and thus, in addition to abovementioned controls recommended by the manufacturers particular attention to clinical and laboratory signs of liver 
dysfunction should be paid for the fi rst 3 months.
 Management of VPA-associated hepatoxicity is largely supportive, and the prognosis for patients with acute liver failure due to 
idiosyncratic drug reactions is poor, with a 60–80 % mortality 
rate without liver transplantation [ 19 ] . In 2001, Bohan et al. proposed the intravenous use of carnitine because carnitine defi -
ciency, either as a pre-existing condition or induced by VPA 
therapy, appears to promote VPA-induced liver failure [ 20 ] . Carnitine is well tolerated and has been shown to reduce fatal 
 outcomes if supplementation therapy was initiated early in 
severe VPA-induced hepatic dysfunction, especially in children 
 [ 9 , 21 , 22 ] . However, further investigation is needed to evaluate 
its clinical value and the appropriate dosage.
Conclusion
▼
 Our study indicates a higher rate of both non-fatal and fatal liver 
failure associated with VPA plus comedication as compared to 
VPA monotherapy. However, comedication per se does not 
increase the risk of fatalities, but is reported in the majority of 
non-fatal and fatal cases. Particular attention to liver function 
should be paid when co-medications with extensive hepatic 
breakdown, e. g.. other antiepileptics (topiramate, carbamazepine, or lamotrigine in particular), benzodiazepines and 
antipsychotics, are used with VPA. Some comedications such as 
propofol or heparin appear to have a disproportionally high risk 
of fatal liver failure when used with VPA.
 Considering the growing number of reported cases of VPAinduced hepatic failure greater focus on the early detection of 
VPA-related hepatotoxicity is warranted. From a patient’s perspective, detailed knowledge of possible VPA side eff ects is 
indispensable and patients need suffi cient information about 
early clinical signs. While patients on VPA should be instructed 
to immediately seek medical help if gastrointestinal symptoms, 
general weakness, gait ataxia, or elevated temperature occur, 
future advances in proteomics, metabonomics and genomics 
will hopefully pave the way to personalised medications in 
which the benefi cial eff ect of VPA is maximised and its toxicity 
minimised.
