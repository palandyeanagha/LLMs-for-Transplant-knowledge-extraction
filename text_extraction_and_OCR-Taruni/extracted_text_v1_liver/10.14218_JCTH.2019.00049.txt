Abstract
Primary biliary cholangitis, formerly known as primary biliary
cirrhosis, is a chronic, autoimmune, and cholestatic disease
ameliorating the biliary epithelial system causing fibrosis and
end-stage liver disease, over time. Patients range from an
asymptomatic phase early in the disease course, to symptoms of decompensated cirrhosis later in its course. This
review focuses on the current consensus on the epidemiology,
diagnosis, and management of patients with primary biliary
cholangitis. We also discuss established medical management as well as novel and investigational therapeutics in the
pipeline for management of PBC.

Introduction
Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), formerly known as primary
biliary cirrhosis, is an autoimmune, T-cell-mediated condition
affecting the biliary epithelial cells. The granulomatous
destruction and subsequent necrosis of cholangiocytes
creates an accumulation of inflammatory infiltrates, which
eventually leads to cholestasis and fibrosis. Because of its
cumulative nature, PBC can present as a spectrum of disease
severity – from no symptoms to cholestasis to biliary cirrhosis
resulting in end-stage liver disease. Patients may present
with symptoms of pruritus, fatigue, other autoimmune diseases (including Sjogren’s syndrome, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis
and/or rheumatoid arthritis), decreased bone mineral density,
hyperlipidemia, and xanthelasma.1,2 Without a prompt diagnosis, treatment may be delayed; as such, the chronic inflammation and destruction of intrahepatic ducts contributes
significantly to disease-related mortality and morbidity.
The terminological and paradigm shift from “primary
biliary cirrhosis” to “primary biliary cholangitis” reflects a
variety of changes within the PBC landscape in recent years,
including understanding of its pathogenesis and development
of novel therapeutics. Since the majority of patients with the
diagnosis do not progress to cirrhosis, this change in the
name was made to more accurately represent the histologic
hallmarks of cholestasis and cholangitis.2
Despite ongoing efforts to improve treatment options for
patients with PBC, disease progression to cirrhosis and liverrelated complications contribute to recurrent hospitalizations,
increased healthcare resource utilization, and increased morbidity and mortality overall.3 Improvement in the diagnosis,
detection of early-stage disease, and understanding different
treatment modalities are essential to reducing disease burden
and complications. Thus, the aim of this paper is to elucidate
current trends in the epidemiology and diagnostic approaches
of PBC by clarifying the current understanding of serologic and
histologic factors associated with PBC. Additionally, we discuss
the management of PBC, with use of both approved and investigational agents, and discuss how to identify at-risk patients to
reduce late-stage complications, morbidity, and mortality.
Epidemiology
The overall prevalence and incidence of PBC remains low
compared to other liver disorders. PBC cases represented
only 165 of the 8,250 liver transplantations done in 2018,
according to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation
Network.4,5 Despite not being a leading indication for liver
transplantation, the overall global rate of PBC incidence continues to rise, with a marked increase since the 1980s.4,6–8
Originally, PBC was thought to be a very rare disease, largely
because of small sample sizes and lack of large longitudinal
studies; moreover, reported prevalence and incidence data
have often been dramatically different between different
studies and regions across the world (and even within different states in the USA).4
In the USA, there are currently no longitudinal studies on
the epidemiology of PBC. In 2018, the Fibrotic Liver Disease

Consortium reported a 12-year point prevalence of PBC of
23.9 per 100,000 persons, but even this number varied
significantly by geographic region and patient demographics
within the USA.9 Their study found that prevalence increased
by over 72% among women (33.5 to 57.8 per 100,000
persons) and by over 114% among men (7.7 to 15.4 per
100,000 persons) during the 12-year period. Studies from
Europe and Asia have also generally reported a steadily
increasing prevalence of PBC within as early as the past
decade.10,11
Geographic clusters
It is estimated that the incidence of PBC ranges from 0.33 to
5.8 per 100,000 persons, with the reported point prevalence
ranging from 1.91 to 33.8 per 100,000 persons, with large
differences seen in geographic region.12–15 Data on specific
epidemiological trends and global incidence is scarce, again
largely due to the lack of a large longitudinal populationbased studies and the marked geographic heterogeneity
within different regions.4,8,16
Both genetic and environmental factors contribute widely
to the pathogenesis of PBC, with epidemiologic data indicating variable prevalence rates of disease into distinct and
different geographical areas, or clusters.17 For example, the
incidence of PBC developing in a well-defined population from
Rochester, Minnesota (USA) was 4.5 per 100,000 personyears for women, and 0.7 per 100,000 person-years for
men, with age and gender-adjusted prevalence for women
being 65.4 per 100,000 persons and 12.1 per 100,000
persons for men.18 Another study aimed to highlight the epidemiology of PBC in Hong Kong; this study found that the
average age/sex adjusted annual incidence rate increased
from 6.7 to 8.1 per million person-years and the age/sex
adjusted prevalence increased from 31.1 to 82.3 per million
between 2000 and 2015.14
Europe and North America have the highest reported
prevalence of PBC worldwide, as reflected in the increasing
rate of PBC-related hospitalizations over the last 30
years.7,16,19 Recently, a large population-based analysis of
both inpatient and outpatient registries in Sweden found
that the prevalence of PBC increased steadily from 5.0 to
34.6 per 100,000 persons from 1987 to 2014, respectively.20
Data collected from an Italian cohort between 2014 to 2015
reported that the point-prevalence of PBC was 27.9 per
100,000 people in Italy.21
In addition to the scarcity of large population-based
studies, misdiagnoses and underreporting of patients may
also contribute to the incidence and prevalence of PBC, as
5–10% of patients may be antimitochondrial antibody (AMA)-
negative.16,22,23 Despite these limitations, data support the
observation that global rates of PBC are rising, as many countries continue to improve diagnostic accuracy, reporting
measures, and surveillance of PBC patients.4,16,19,22,23
Heterogeneity
Heterogeneity in prevalence can in part be explained by
regional variation in diagnostic awareness or access to care;
however, several studies have suggested that environmental
exposures may play a role in the development of specific
regional clusters of PBC.8,16,24 Some studies support a high
concordance among monozygotic twins and human leukocyte
antigen alleles; yet, only about 15% of PBC variability has
been accounted for by genetics.16,25–29 PBC frequently develops around the ages of 40–60 years, with women more commonly affected than men (at a ratio of 9:1).4,11,30 This femaleto-male ratio also persists in other countries, such as Taipei
(9:1), Japan (9.1:1), and mainland China (6.82:1).31,32
Although there is a female predominance, men who develop
PBC tend to have a more severe and aggressive disease
process with more severe lobular inflammation.33 Men are
also more likely to be unresponsive to the conventional firstline treatment, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA).33
Etiopathophysiology
Significant progress has been made in understanding the
immune responses involved in the pathophysiology of PBC.
However, many aspects of the etiology and pathogenesis of
the destruction of biliary epithelial cells remains incompletely
explained.4,23,34 It is known that PBC involves a predominantly T-cell mediated destruction of intrahepatic bile ducts,
likely initiated when a genetically susceptible individual
comes into contact with an antigen in the environment such
as an infectious pathogen, medication or other compound,
triggering an autoimmune event.2
Regardless of the autoimmune trigger, the disease begins
with specific AMA targeting of the lipoic acid on the 2-oxo acid
dehydrogenases, which are located on the inner mitochondrial
membrane. This enzyme then targets the E2 subunit of the
pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, which eventually leads to
biliary epithelial cell destruction. In addition, peptides from
viruses or bacteria that are structurally similar to pyruvate
dehydrogenase complex-dihydrolipoyltransacetylase (referred
to as PDC-E2) epitopes can trigger an autoimmune response
through molecular mimicry.2,34–36 An increase in PDC-E2 may
lead to a loss of humoral tolerance and increases the differentiation of T-cells in the liver, resulting in damage to the intrahepatic biliary epithelial cells, scarring, fibrosis, and ductal
destruction.2,34–36 The exposure of extraductular liver parenchyma to bile acids contributes to hepatocyte injury, fibrosis,
and eventually cirrhosis.
Clinical manifestations of PBC
Signs, symptoms, and associated autoimmune
conditions
The clinical presentation of PBC can vary greatly. Up to 50–
60% of patients with PBC are asymptomatic at the time of
diagnosis, and only present with abnormal liver function
tests.37 Fatigue is one of the most common symptoms, which
is present in almost 80% of patients with PBC; however, there
is no correlation between fatigue and disease severity or duration.2,19,22 It is reported that 20% of these patients will have
concomitant thyroid disorders, making it important for patients
with PBC to get yearly thyroid function testing.2 Pruritus is a
common symptom of PBC, which tends to be worse at night, in
the heat, and during pregnancy, and can affect up to 20–70%
of patients.22,38 Dermatologic findings including hyperpigmentation, jaundice, xanthomas, xanthelasmas, xerosis, and dermatographism are all common among patients with PBC.23,39
Patients with PBC often have other rheumatologic or autoimmune diseases as well, most commonly Sjogren’s syndrome
and autoimmune thyroid diseases, which can affect up to
40–65% of patients.23,39 About 5–10% of patients will also
present with cutaneous scleroderma, and up to 10% of
50 Journal of Clinical and Translational Hepatology 2020 vol. 8 | 49–60
Galoosian A. et al: Updates in primary biliary cholangitis

patients may have concomitant rheumatoid arthritis.39 During
the end stages of PBC, patients may develop symptoms of
portal hypertension, which is typically seen in patients with
at least bridging fibrosis.22,30,40
Natural history
The natural history and prognosis of PBC has changed and
improved significantly over the last several decades. The
disease, without any treatment, has gone from a slow,
progressive disease resulting in liver fibrosis and cirrhosis to
eventual hepatic decompensation and death, to a disease
process with slower rates of progression and fibrosis, and
higher rates of clinical remission.41,42 This can be explained
partially by both the earlier diagnosis and earlier treatment of
PBC. Without treatment, the intrahepatic bile ducts are
destroyed, causing bile acid to build up within the liver,
leading to cholestasis. Cholestasis contributes to chronic
granulomatous inflammation, which eventually leads to fibrosis and the subsequent development of cirrhosis and portal
hypertension, along with its associated complications, including a predisposition to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).43
With increasing awareness and understanding of the
natural history of the disease, as well as earlier diagnosis
and prompt treatment initiation, the progression to fibrosis
and cirrhosis among PBC patients is becoming increasingly
rarer, as demonstrated by the decrease in the indications of
liver transplantation for PBC patients.19,41,44 The introduction
and use of UDCA for treating PBC has impacted the natural
history of the disease.
Diagnostic criteria
Serological features
Environmental triggers and autoimmunity may play crucial
immunologic roles in the development of PBC. The current
etiologic understanding suggests that the development of PBC
requires both a genetic predisposition and exposure to an
unknown environmental trigger, thereby initiating the immunologic cascade that destroys biliary cells.5,38 Autoantibodies
are commonly found in patients with PBC and are often used to
aid diagnosis. Approximately 90–95% of patients with PBC
have detectable AMA, an autoantibody that targets lipoic acid
present on the 2-oxo-acid dehydrogenase complexes within
the inner mitochondrial membrane that has high disease specificity.23,27,45 A large proportion of these patients also have
elevated levels of antinuclear antibodies, alkaline phosphatase
(ALP), polyclonal IgM, and inflammatory cytokines, which
include TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-1, and IL-6.5,27,38,45–47
Approximately 50% of patients are found to have antinuclear
antibody positivity, most commonly of nuclear-rim or nucleardot patterns, which are highly specific for PBC.38,48
Between 5–10% of patients with PBC are AMA-negative,
leading to potential misdiagnosis and under-treatment of the
actual disease.16,22,23 The American Association for the Study
of Liver Diseases (AASLD) recently updated its practice guidelines to include the antibodies against sp100 and gp210 as
serum markers, with the intent of helping to identify patients
who are negative for AMA, via indirect immunofluorescence.
These PBC-specific antinuclear antibodies are present in over
30% of AMA-negative patients, allowing for more accurate
diagnosis in those who did not meet previous diagnostic
guideline criteria.
Liver biochemistry and diagnostic algorithm
Previous diagnostic guidelines focused on serologic, histologic, and immunologic testing for a diagnosis of PBC. In
2018, the AASLD released updated practice guidelines, in
which they outlined the currently used diagnostic criteria for
PBC.23 Accordingly, a diagnosis of PBC today is established
based on the presence of two of three of the following:
1. An elevated serum-based ALP level (>1.5 times the upper limit
of normal (ULN))
2. Histologic evidence of chronic nonsuppurative biliary ductal destruction (florid duct lesion)
3. The presence of AMA at a titer of 1:40 or greater
ALP levels are not only used for diagnosis but are associated
with both the severity of inflammation and ductopenia.49 ALP
levels also reflect markers of cholestasis, and higher levels of
ALP are associated with higher risk of liver transplantation and
death.50,51 Similarly, aminotransferase and IgM levels reflect
inflammation and the severity of periportal and lobular
necrosis.49,52,53 Bilirubin has also been studied in PBC as a
potential early marker for hepatic dysfunction; in conjunction
with low albumin and low platelets, an elevated serum bilirubin
may precede the development of cirrhosis and portal hypertension, and has been shown to be an important biomarker to
assess disease severity.49,52,53 The discovery of more serologic
markers known to be associated with PBC will aid considerably
in the diagnosis of patients with atypical clinical presentations.
Patients with symptoms typical for autoimmune-related biliary
disease or patients with features of PBC-autoimmune hepatitis
overlap syndrome may benefit from more accurate markers of
disease. Patients may also present with dyslipidemia, particularly with an elevated high-density lipoprotein level.
Role of liver biopsy
As stated above, the diagnosis of PBC can be made on the basis
of clinical features, liver biochemical and autoantibody testing,
and imaging to exclude extrahepatic biliary obstruction. Liver
biopsy is not required in most cases but can be helpful in cases
without a certain diagnosis by evaluating for concomitant
conditions such as autoimmune hepatitis and nonalcoholic
steatohepatitis (NASH). Liver biopsy also holds prognostic
value, based on disease activity and fibrosis stage. A classic
histologic characteristic of PBC is chronic nonsuppurative
cholangitis affecting the interlobular and septal bile ducts.
Fibrosis in PBC can be staged using the METAVIR system,
which is a four-point scale, in which stage 0 represents normal
liver, stage 1 represents portal inflammation with or without
florid duct lesions, stage 2 represents periportal fibrosis, stage
3 represents bridging fibrosis, and stage 4 represents cirrhosis.54,55 The presence of cirrhosis is associated with a worse
prognosis and increased risk of developing complications.
Radiographic features and noninvasive imaging
modalities
Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography and/or magnetic resonance imaging are a noninvasive method of imaging
the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary tree. These imaging
modalities are not required but can aid in the exclusion of
patients with other cholestatic liver diseases, such as primary
sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), and to rule out concomitant
pancreatic or biliary masses causing biliary obstruction.2,56
Journal of Clinical and Translational Hepatology 2020 vol. 8 | 49–60 51
Galoosian A. et al: Updates in primary biliary cholangitis

There are also newer imaging modalities, such as transient
elastography, that evaluate disease progression, prognosis,
and treatment response. Transient elastography-derived
liver stiffness measurement has been used as a surrogate
marker of liver fibrosis in PBC patients, allowing noninvasive
monitoring over time.54 A prospective performance analysis
was completed in 2012 which showed the benefit of noninvasive testing using transient elastography in patients with PBC
using UDCA. Using a generalized Cox linear regression model,
the authors showed that, in general, patients had about an
overall progression rate of 0.48 + 0.21 kPa/year (p = 0.02).54
A cutoff value of 2.1 kPa/year was associated with an 8.4-fold
increased risk of liver decompensations, liver transplantations, or deaths (p < 0.001).54 Accuracy is limited in patients
with ascites obesity. Progression of liver stiffness over time is
predictive of poorer outcomes, and patients with response to
UDCA showed improvement in liver stiffness scores.54,56 The
authors also purported that transient elastography is superior
in determining liver fibrosis compared to using biochemical
testing alone, which is important in the prognostication of
PBC patients over time.
PBC complications
Patients with PBC are at an increased risk of developing HCC,
though at a lower rate compared to those with other chronic
liver diseases.37,43 In a multicenter study involving over 4,500
patients over a 40-year period, Trivedi et al.57 showed that the
incidence of HCC among PBC patients was 3.4 cases per 1,000
person-years. In particular, PBC patients with advanced age at
diagnosis, advanced disease, male sex, and suboptimal
response to UDCA are at higher risk for development of
HCC.23 However, biochemical nonresponse to treatment has
been shown to be a significant predictor of future risk for developing HCC. According to one study, biochemical nonresponse
to treatment for PBC after one year had a hazard ratio of 3.44
(p < 0.001) in developing HCC on multivariate analysis.57
Development of HCC in patients with PBC is associated
with notably worse transplant-free and overall survival.43
Given this, PBC patients with known or suspected cirrhosis
should receive screening ultrasounds for HCC with or
without alpha fetoprotein at regular 6 month intervals. Development of portal hypertension can also occur in these
patients with cirrhosis or in some patients before full-blown
cirrhosis, given granulomatous inflammation leading to presinusoidal portal hypertension.
PBC patients are also at higher risk of osteopenia and
osteoporosis, mostly related to decreased bone formation
and concomitant vitamin D deficiency, which places them at
higher risk of fracture. Baseline bone mineral density scans
should be done at diagnosis and then subsequent screening
should be continued on the basis of risk.23,43 General management includes calcium and vitamin D supplementation,
encouraged weight-bearing exercises, and bisphosphonates
to improve bone mineral density, though their effectiveness
in PBC is not clear.23 Because of chronic cholestasis, hyperlipidemia is common but rarely of clinical significance; lipid-lowering therapies should be considered in patients with other
coexisting cardiovascular risk factors. Fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies are possible as well and can be treated with appropriate supplementation. Table 1 suggests a common follow-up
schedule for patients with PBC in the primary care setting.
In terms of managing symptom complications, no good
treatment exists for the treatment of fatigue in patients with
PBC. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study
was conducted to evaluate the effects of modafinil with
fatigue in patients with PBC, however no beneficial effects
on fatigue were found when compared with placebo.58 A clinical trial is currently in the enrollment phase to study the efficacy and impact of mindfulness-based interventions for the
treatment of moderate to severe fatigue in patients with PBC
(ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03684187).
Medical management
Without treatment, patients with PBC progress, on average,
one histologic stage within 2 years.59 Treatment of PBC is
aimed at reducing symptoms of cholestasis, preventing fibrosis progression and avoiding complications of end-stage
disease.23 Previous data had shown the median survival of a
patient with PBC not on treatment was dependent on symptoms, with median survival of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients of 7.5 years and 16 years, respectively.44,60
Recent data suggest, however, that asymptomatic patients
with PBC often have less severe disease at diagnosis than
those with symptomatic PBC; yet, the absence of symptoms
alone is not associated with a better prognosis and does not
show a mortality benefit.61 Unlike other autoimmune diseases, biologic and immune-based therapies have not been
shown to be effective in treating patients with PBC.62 Herein,
we describe approved treatments, off-label therapies, and
drugs in development for the treatment of PBC (see Fig. 1
for a detailed schema of treatment options).
The main treatment paradigms of disease management for
patients with PBC include slowing the progression of the disease
and managing the symptoms and complications of chronic
cholestasis. The only two Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
medications that are approved for the treatment of PBC are
UDCA and obeticholic acid (OCA); however, over the last several
years, there have been several therapies, currently under different phases of clinical trials, that have been shown to be effective
as both primary and adjuvant medications for the treatment of
PBC. Herein, we will discuss the approved therapies for PBC,
followed by the novel and investigational therapies that have
been under clinical investigations over the last several years.
Approved therapies: What is established
UDCA
UDCA is a naturally occurring, hydrophilic bile acid that was
originally used for gallstone dissolution. It was noted that
Table 1. Follow-up schedule for patients with PBC in the primary care

suspected cirrhosis, including evidence of synthetic liver dysfunction in labs

patients treated with UDCA had associated decreases in their
ALP levels, leading to the eventual approval for its treatment
of PBC. UDCA is incorporated into the bile acid pool, replacing
other more toxic bile acids and reducing inflammation,
cholestasis and cell lysis.63 Although UDCA has changed the
landscape of PBC treatment, only 40% to 60% of patients
with PBC respond adequately to UDCA.64 However, because
of its limited side effects (up to 2% report diarrhea and pruritus), current guidelines recommend UDCA as the first-line
treatment for PBC, at a dose of 13–15 mg/kg/day.63 Further,
higher doses have not been shown to be effective in PBC.51
To investigate the impact of UDCA on the incidence of
cirrhosis-related complications and on overall survival in PBC,
Harms et al.65 reviewed data from 16 liver centers in 10 countries in Europe and North America in the Global PBC Study
Group. This large study found that early diagnosis and early
treatment are independent protective factors in delaying PBCrelated complications. Additionally, patients with higher aspartate aminotransferase to platelets ratio index (commonly
known as the APRI) and patients who were UDCA nonresponders were both more likely to experience disease complications;
patients who had both an elevated APRI score and proved to be
UDCA nonresponders experienced a 10-year complication rate
of 37.4% compared to 3.2% in those with a lower APRI score
and a response to treatment.2,65
Guidelines continue to support the role of UDCA as firstline therapy for patients with PBC. After patients are placed on
an adequate dose of UDCA, treatment response should be
measured after 1 year of treatment. Disease response is
defined by biomarkers such as ALP and total bilirubin, based
on the Rochester I, Barcelona, Paris I, Rotterdam, Toronto,
Paris II, Rochester II, and Global treatment response criteria.42,50,52,53,66–68 Although many models exist for determining risk of disease progression, including the GLOBE and UKPBC risk scoring systems, there is insufficient evidence to
recommend one scoring system over another.50,69,70 Both
the GLOBE and UK-PBC risk scoring systems were found to
be predictive of cirrhosis-related complications based on a
recent multicenter Turkish study.71 Table 2 provides a
review of current prognostication models.
Patients with incomplete biochemical response to UDCA
and hence with risk of progressive liver disease and complications, should be evaluated for a second-line agent or be
considered for available clinical trials.
OCA
OCA was first approved in May 2017 to be used in conjunction
with UDCA for PBC patients with an inadequate response to
UDCA, or as monotherapy for those who cannot tolerate
UDCA. OCA is a modified bile acid farnesoid X receptor
(FXR) agonist which when activated, modulates various
steps in bile acid homeostasis, which culminates to a
decrease in bile acid synthesis and an increase in its clearance. The FXR agonist also plays an important role in downregulating inflammatory signaling, which reduces
inflammation and cholestasis in the liver.72 Overall, OCA is
well tolerated and has been shown to decrease ALP and
total bilirubin.65,73,74 In the landmark phase 3 Perioperative
Ischemic Evaluation Study (POISE) trail, the primary

endpoint of an ALP level of less than 1.67 times the ULN
range, with a reduction of at least 15% from baseline and a
normal total bilirubin level met in an intention-to-treat analysis. The primary endpoint occurred in more patients in the 5–
10 mg titration group (46%) and the 10 mg group (47%) than
in the placebo group (10%; p < 0.001 for both comparisons).74,75 Changes in noninvasive measures of liver fibrosis
did not differ significantly between either treatment group or
the placebo group at 12 months. However, the most common
adverse event of OCA is dose-dependent pruritus. Up to 56%
of patients in the 5–10 mg titration group and 68% of patients
in the 10 mg group discontinued OCA compared to 38% in the
placebo arm.73,74 Pruritus returned back to baseline during
the open-lab extension phase of the study. Despite the
increase in pruritus, discontinuation rates remained low in
either arm of the study, with 0% of patients in the placebo
group versus 1% of patients discontinuing the drug in the
5–10 mg titration group and 10% of patients discontinuing
the drug in the higher than 10 mg OCA dose group.76 In addition, OCA has also been studied in Child-Pugh Class A PBC
patients in the POISE trial, with ongoing study in those
Child-Pugh Classes B and C with dose-reduction or caution
for usage in Child-Pugh Classes B and C. The data show that
plasma exposure to OCA and its active conjugates and
metabolites increases significantly in patients with moderate
to severe hepatic impairment.23 For example, compared to
patients with normal liver function, Child-Pugh Class A
patients have a 1.1-fold increase in OCA conjugates compared to a 4-fold increase in Child-Pugh B and 17-fold
increase in Child-Pugh C patients.77 As such, it is recommended for Child-Pugh B and C patients to start patients on 5 mg
OCA weekly; then, doses can be increased to 10 mg twice
weekly (3 days apart) after 3 months.
Additionally, OCA has been showed to sustain improved
liver biochemistry for up to 6 years in patients with PBC; the
results of the 5-year open-label extension of the phase III,
placebo-controlled POISE trial was reported most recently
during the AASLD 2019 Liver Meeting. POISE included a 12-
month double-blind phase with the 5-year open-label extension.78,79 As many as 97.5% of patients (193 of 198 patients)
enrolled in the open-label extension and received OCA, but
only 60% of patients completed 5 years of the OCA treatment
and 52 patients who had received OCA in the double-blind
phase of the trial completed 6 years of treatment after the
open-label extension was complete. The mean total bilirubin
remained stable through 72 months of OCA treatment, and
throughout the study, there was no significant worsening in
hepatic stiffness as measured by transient elastography in a
subset of patients. During the open-label extension, only
eight patients (4%) discontinued treatment due to pruritus.76
Adverse events were consistent with the established safety
profile of OCA in PBC, with no new safety observations
during long-term treatment, out to 6 years.
Samur et al.80 conducted a simulation analysis of the clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of OCA for the treatment of
PBC. This study found that over a 15-year period, UDCA +
OCA dual therapy could decrease the cumulative incidences
of decompensated cirrhosis from 12.2% to 4.5%, of HCC
from 9.1% to 4.0%, of liver-related mortality from 16.2%
to 5.7%, and of liver transplantations from 4.5% to 1.2%.
This combination also increased transplant-free survival
from 61.1% to 72.9%.80 Despite these substantial improvements in long-term outcomes, the authors concluded that
OCA is not currently cost-effective, as the lifetime cost of
PBC treatment would increase from $63,000 to $902,000 (a
1,330% increment) per patient.80
Emerging therapies: What is new and what is in the
pipeline
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha
and -gamma agonists
The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) subfamilies include a, b, d, and g, which regulate the transcription
of various genes. PPAR-g is primarily found in the adipose
tissue and the heart. An example of PPAR-g are the thiazolidinediones. PPAR−d (also known as PPAR-b) is primarily
found in the liver and in the peripheral tissues, and includes

Galoosian A. et al: Updates in primary biliary cholangitis

drugs such as seladelpar (primarily PPAR-d agonist). PPAR-a
(i.e. fibrates), which is found in the liver, muscle, and kidneys,
is involved in the beta oxidation of fatty acids and regulation of
lipid metabolism. In addition, both PPAR-a and PPAR-d are
important regulators of bile acid homeostasis.72 Both PPAR-a
and PPAR-d work by acting on transcription factors which
reduce inflammation (thus lowering IgM) and increase bile
acid excretion. The most common type of PPAR agonists are
the fibrates, which include fenofibrate (more PPAR-a selective)
and bezafibrate (pan-selective).
A recent trial of fibrates in PBC enrolled 100 Korean patients
with UDCA-refractory PBC, including 71 patients who received
UDCA monotherapy and 29 patients who received UDCA +
fibrate therapy (either 160 mg/day fenofibrate or 400 mg/day
bezafibrate). At follow-up after 18 months, the UDCA + fibrate
group showed a higher probability of normalizing ALP levels
compared to the UDCA monotherapy group (hazard ratio =
5.00, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.87–8.73, p < 0.001).81
Another randomized controlled trial in Europe included 100
patients with PBC treated for 2 years with either UDCA +
placebo or UDCA + bezafibrate (the BEZURSO trial).82 In this
study, combination therapy was associated with improvement
in ALP and 30% of patients saw normalization on all liver function tests. The combination group in this study also reported
improvement in pruritus. Bezafibrate, however, is not currently
approved for use in the USA.
More recently, during AASLD’s The Liver Meeting in 2019,
it was published that bezafibrate was superior to placebo for
the treatment of pruritus in cholestatic liver diseases, and
authors concluded that it should be the first-line treatment of
pruritus for patients with PBC and PSC, as determined from
the Fibrates for Cholestatic ITCH Trial.83 The primary endpoint
of the study was a 50% reduction in pruritus on a visual analogue scale, and 43.7% of patients in the bezafibrate treatment arm achieved the primary endpoint compared to only
11% in the placebo arm (p = 0.003).42
In addition, another pan-selective PPAR agonist, elafibranor, which targets both PPAR-a and PPAR-d, has been studied
in patients with PBC and results were discussed at the 2019
European Association for the Study of the Liver International
Liver Congress Meeting. A phase 2 multi-center, double-blind,
randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial was reported to
evaluate the efficacy and safety of elafibranor after 12 weeks
of treatment in patients with PBC with inadequate response to
UDCA. Forty-five patients were randomized into three arms:
1) elafibranor at 80 mg, 2) elafibranor at 120 mg, or 3)
placebo. The primary endpoint of the study was a change in
serum ALP at the end of 12 weeks compared to baseline. Both
doses of elafibranor demonstrated a significant change in ALP,
a decrease of 48% from baseline in the 80 mg group and 41%
decrease in the 120 mg group; as expected, there was a ;3%
increase in ALP from baseline in the placebo group. A key
secondary endpoint from this trial was the responder rate for
patients achieving the composite endpoint of serum ALP
<1.67 3 the ULN, and ALP decrease >15%, and total bilirubin
<ULN. This secondary endpoint was achieved in approximately 67% patients for the 80 mg group (p = 0.001) and
79% of patients in the 120 mg group (p < 0.001), as compared to only 6.7% in the placebo group. As such, in July
2019, the USA FDA and the European Medicines Agency
have granted Orphan Drug Designation to elafibranor for the
treatment of PBC in addition to an upcoming phase 3 trial.
Seladelpar, a selective PPAR-d agonist, has been studied in
a randomized control trial of patients with PBC and NASH84
with primary endpoint of ALP levels < 1.67 3 the ULN in
patients with PBC. In a phase II study, 70 patients were
screened at 29 sites in North America and Europe. During
the recruitment phase of the study, three of the seventy
patients developed a reversible and asymptomatic increase
in their alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels (one patient
on the 50 mg dose, and two on the 200 mg dose), ranging
from just over 5- to 20-times the ULN. As such, the original
study with higher doses was terminated, and a newer lowdose phase II study (5 mg and 10 mg of seladelpar groups)
was initiated and the 12-week interim results were first published at the AASLD Liver Meeting in 2017,85 showing 45%
and 82% of patients on the 5 mg group and 10 mg group,
respectively, achieved the primary endpoint. Additionally,
12% of the 5 mg group and 45% of the 10 mg group had
ALP less than the ULN at week 12. This 12-week analysis
also revealed improvements in other biochemical parameters
as well, including significant decreases in ALT and cholesterol
levels.85 Given the promising results of the interim analysis,
the study entered open enrollment extension phase to extend
the duration, increase study participants, and add a 2 mg arm
to assess the minimally effective dose.
Additionally, a phase III multicenter and international
study (ENHANCE) was initiated at the end of 2018, and
enrolled 265 patients by mid-November 2019. However, on
November 25, 2019, the open-label extension phase of the
study was placed on hold after a similar study which was
evaluating the effectiveness of seladelpar in NASH patients
found that patients receiving seladelpar had atypical histologic findings characterized as interface hepatitis. As such,
although the interim data was promising, further investigations are placed on hold until investigators can try to identify a
mechanism of action and to understand if the observed
histological changes in patients taking seladelpar are NASHspecific or if this adverse event is universal among all liver
disease etiologies.
Fibroblast growth factor-19 analogues (antifibrotic
and anti-inflammatory)
Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-19 is an endocrine hormone
that is induced by the activation of the FXR in ileal enterocytes.86 After its activation, FGF-19 acts on hepatocytes to
repress bile acid synthesis and gluconeogenesis, and to stimulate hepatic glycogenesis and protein synthesis (Fig. 2).86
FGF-19 is part of a signaling pathway that regulates the
enterohepatic response of bile acid synthesis. In the normal
liver, FGF-19 expression is absent; however, in cholestatic
liver diseases, FGF-19 expression is increased in the liver, in
response to both extrahepatic and intrahepatic cholestasis.87
Recent evidence also suggests an antifibrotic activity of FGF19 analogues.87 For example, FGF-19 is also involved in the
regulation of proinflammatory cytokines in the cholangiocytes.87 Serum levels of FGF-19 correlate with worse liver
enzyme biochemistry levels; an elevated serum FGF-19 was
also seen in UDCA nonresponders, allowing one study to conclude that PBC induces changes in bile acid synthesis and that
FGF-19 levels correlate with liver disease severity in cholestatic liver diseases.88 That same study found that administering an FGF-19 mimetic can increase circulating FGF-19 and
thus suppress bile acid synthesis.
In a multicenter randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial is investigating the use of
NGM282 (FGF-19 analogue) for the treatment of PBC in
Journal of Clinical and Translational Hepatology 2020 vol. 8 | 49–60 55
Galoosian A. et al: Updates in primary biliary cholangitis

patients who had inadequate response to UDCA.51 The
authors conclude that the administration of NGM282 (14
patients in the 0.3 mg group, 13 patients in the 3 mg group,
and 15 patients in the placebo group) reduced ALP levels and
transaminase levels, as well as markers of cholestasis, hepatocellular injury and inflammation (IgM levels) in a follow-up
of 28 days. The 0.3 mg group had an average of 15.9%
decrease in ALP levels (95% CI: 3.9%–25.6%, p < 0.001)
versus an average of 19.0% decrease in ALP in the 3 mg
group (95% CI: 6.7%–29.0%, p < 0.001). However, longer
length studies are needed to assess overall effectiveness and
tolerability.
Other FXR agonists (nonsteroidal)
FXRs are nuclear hormone receptors that are integral in
bilirubin metabolism, primarily in the liver. The most
common FXR agonist studied and approved for treatment of
PBC is OCA. Bile acids are the naturally occurring ligands of
FXR. FXRs regulate the rate-limiting step in bile acid synthesis
(Fig. 2).89 FXR activation protects against cholestatic-induced
liver injury, and other studies have shown a protective effect
of FXR activation in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver
disease.89,90 Additional FXR agonists are being investigated
for PBC, including in a phase II dose-ranging, randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, currently recruiting
participants to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of EDP-305 in patients with PBC with or
without incomplete response to UDCA (ClinicalTrials.gov
Identifier: NCT03394924).
In a recent phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo
controlled trial of 71 patients, the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of cilofexor (GS-9674, which is a non-steroidal FXR
agonist) evaluated in patients without advanced PBC. Fig. 2
shows the mechanism of action of this drug. This trial was
completed recently, and the results of the phase II trial were
presented at AASLD’s The Liver Meeting in 2019. The authors
demonstrated that patients treated with cilofexor at 100 mg
had significant decreases (compared to placebo) in serum ALP,
gamma-glutamyltransferase, and ALT levels (ALP mean reduction of -13.8%, p = 0.005; gamma-glutamyltransferase mean
reduction of 47.7%, p < 0.001; ALT mean reduction of
-17.8%, p = 0.08).91 The study also showed a significant
reduction in primary bile acids compared to placebo (reduction
of −30.5%, p = 0.0008). At the same meeting, patientreported outcomes in patients with PSC during treatment
with cilofexor were reported.92 Patient-reported outcomes
are important markers in clinical outcomes and contribute
greatly to the efficacy of a drug. During long-term treatment
with 100 mg cilofexor, patients experienced improvement in
some aspects of their patient-reported outcomes.92
Antifibrotic agents
Cholangiocyte injury and leakage of bile acid into the liver
parenchyma are the key events in fibrosis progression in PBC
Fig. 2. Steroidal and nonsteroidal FXR agonists and FGF-19 mechanism of action. FXR is a nuclear hormone receptor that is highly expressed in the gastrointestinal
tract, adrenal glands, kidneys, and the liver. FXR is the primary regulator of BA homeostasis. By activating FXR, OCA is a steroidal FXR agonist and it is expected to do three things:
1) decrease fibrosis by decreasing fibrogenesis, stellate cell activation, and increase matrix degradation, 2) decrease inflammation, and 3) regulate BA homeostasis by decreasing
its synthesis, uptake and absorption, and increasing its secretion. GS-9674 is a nonsteroidal FXR agonist in the intestine, which triggers release of FGF-19 from the intestinal
mucosa. FGF-19, which is an endocrine hormone, then binds to hepatic receptor complex tyrosine kinase FGFR4 and its co-receptor b-klotho, which inhibits the gene transcription
of the CYP7A1 BA synthesis gene (encoding cholesterol 7-alpha-hydroxylase), the SREBP1c lipogenic gene (encoding sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1C), and the
G6PC gluconeogenic gene (encoding the glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit), leading to decreases in BA synthesis, lipogenesis, and gluconeogenesis. Concurrently, FXR in
the liver induces SHP, a negative nuclear receptor, which in turn also inhibits gene transcription of CYP7A1, SREBP1c, and G6PC. Cilofexor (GS-9674) has been shown to significantly reduce fibrosis and portal hypertension in a murine model of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, to have anti-inflammatory property in vivo, and to increase eNOS.

and other cholestatic liver diseases.93 Hepatic stellate cell
activation is ultimately the final common pathway in the formation of fibrosis in chronic liver diseases. NADPH oxidase
(referred to as NOX) plays a role in stellate cell-mediated
fibrogenesis. In vivo data has demonstrated that setanaxib
(a dual inhibitor of NOX1 and NOX2) may be an effective antifibrotic drug in PBC.93 Additional studies are needed,
however, to prove the efficacy of this and other compounds
in human patients.
Norursodeoxycholic acid and tauroursodeoxycholic
acid
The molecular structure of norursodeoxycholic acid (norUDCA)
is similar to UDCA, except that it lacks a methylene group in
its side-chain. In theory, norUDCA can then allow for
cholehepatic shunting of bile salts, instead of by enterohepatic circulation. norUDCA can also stimulate secretion
of cholangiocytes found in bile ducts, which can help flush
the ducts of bile salts and reinforce the ductal wall epithelium. The use of norUDCA as treatment has been shown to be
beneficial in PSC, yet its usefulness in PBC has yet to be
elucidated. Multiple animal studies have shown improvement in fibrosis and inflammation in mice with cholestatic
liver diseases treated with norUDCA, including PBC.94,95 A
multicenter, double-blind trial in China comparing tauroursodeoxycholic acid and UDCA was completed in 2013 and
showed that tauroursodeoxycholic acid was non-inferior to
UDCA in biochemical response and had a better profile in
mitigating symptoms associated with PBC.96 Further
studies are needed in the USA to account for external validity
of this trial.
Ileal apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter
inhibitors
The apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT) is
found in the brush-border membrane primarily expressed in
the distal ileum. It is responsible for the reuptake of bile acids
and the maintenance of the enterohepatic circulation. ASBT is
up-regulated in PBC patients; therefore, the inhibition of
ASBT may counteract the toxicity caused by bile acids.
Studies have shown that by inhibiting ASBT, both cholestatic
injury and fibrosis improves by increasing bile acid excretion
in fecal matter.97 There is currently a phase II trial underway
that is comparing combination therapy of a selective ASBT
inhibitor (lopixibat) with UDCA; the preliminary results,
however, show poor effects on ALP and pruritus, though
there are reductions in transaminases.98
Immunomodulating agents
Since PBC is an autoimmune disease, various immunological
hallmarks have been implicated in its pathogenesis, including humoral, cytotoxic and the innate immune response in
destroying the small bile ducts. Rituximab is an anti-CD20
monoclonal antibody that selectively decreases B cells and
which has been used for years in other autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, and other immunemediated disorders.99 Although this drug is used in other
autoimmune disorders, a study evaluating 14 patients who
did not respond to UDCA were given rituximab. Six months
after starting infusion therapy, there was a decrease in autoantibody production and a significant decrease in pruritus
but no significant decrease was observed in ALP levels.99
Another phase II trial was completed in the UK to evaluate
symptoms of fatigue in 71 patients with PBC.100 Using an
intention-to-treat analysis, this study found significant
decrease in fatigue at 3 months between the rituximab and
placebo arms (adjusted mean difference −0.9, 95% CI:
−4.6–3.1). Another open-label, active treatment study was
recently completed in 2018, which studied the efficacy and
safety of abatacept for the treatment of PBC in patients with
incomplete response to UDCA. This study showed that, much
like other biologic therapies, the treatment was ineffective in
achieving biochemical responses associated with improved
clinical outcomes.101
In addition, another biologic therapy has failed to show
significant reductions in biochemical markers of cholestasis. A phase 2 open-label trial using ustekinumab, an antiinterleukin-12/23 monoclonal antibody, for PBC patients
with inadequate response to UDCA showed a modest
decrease in ALP after 28 weeks of therapy that was not
significant, and overt proof-of-concept was not established
per the a priori primary endpoint’s proposed efficacy.45,102
Conclusions, remarks, and future directions
PBC is a chronic and slowly progressive cholestatic liver
disease that is caused by the autoimmune and non-suppurative destruction of the bile ducts which can lead to fibrosis
and eventually cirrhosis. Mainstay treatments include UDCA
as first-line standard of care therapy, while OCA is used as an
adjuvant therapeutic agent for patients with incomplete
response to UDCA or as a first-line agent for patients who
cannot tolerate UDCA. Although UDCA continues to be the
mainstay treatment, UDCA leaves over one-third of patients
at risk for disease progression by using methods described in
Table 2. Other than UDCA and OCA, there are no other FDAapproved treatment agents for PBC at this time. As such, this
review provides information regarding the promising therapeutic landscape for PBC, including many agents which are
currently under clinical trials. New anticholestatic pharmacologic agents, such as PPAR agonists, choleretics, bile acid suppressants, antifibrotics and anti-inflammatories, provide
promising outlooks for treatment of PBC and possibly other
diseases of cholestasis and NASH. In addition, early emerging
data indicates combination therapy may also contribute to the
landscape of PBC treatments with improved efficacy and
potential benefits in symptoms such as pruritus and fatigue,
and in quality of life.
