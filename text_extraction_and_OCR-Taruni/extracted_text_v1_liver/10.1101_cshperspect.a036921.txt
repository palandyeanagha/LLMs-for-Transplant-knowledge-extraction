The hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects 71.1 million persons and causes 400,000 deaths annually
worldwide. HCV mostly infects the liver, causing acute and chronic necroinflammatory
damage, which may progress toward cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In addition,
HCV has been associated with several extrahepatic manifestations. The advent of safe and
effective direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) has made the dream of eliminating this public health
scourge feasible in the medium term. Prospective studies using DAA-based regimens have
shown the benefit of HCV clearance in terms of both liver- and non-liver-related mortality.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection poses a
major global health threat. In 2015, HCV
was estimated to infect ∼71.1 million persons
worldwide and to cause approximately 400,000
deaths annually, two-thirds attributable to decompensated cirrhosis, and one-third to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (www.who.int/
hepatitis/publications/global-hepatitis-report20
17/en). The figures provided by the Polaris Observatory (H Razavi, pers. comm.) for 2016 are
only slightly different; with a viremic pool, at the
beginning of 2016, at 71.1 million infected persons, an annual input of 1,498,000 acute infections of which 270,000 were spontaneously
cured, whereas, as output, there were a total of
1,615,000 patients cured by antiviral treatment,
342,000 liver-related and 794,000 non-liver-related deaths (Fig. 1).
The real figures are, however, unknown because of the fact that a high proportion of
deaths attributable to HCV are not reported as
such, with hepatitis C not even being mentioned in the death certificate (Mahajan et al.
2014; Keiser et al. 2018). Another reason suggesting that the global health burden caused
by HCV is underestimated is the fact that
many infected patients may also die of disorders
that are non-liver-related and yet are caused
by HCV. Indeed, HCV may contribute to the
pathogenesis of many extrahepatic disorders,
potentially leading to death, although a precise
estimate of the fraction of mortality attributable
to HCV is difficult to obtain. These figures may
be relevant, and yet were not included in the
tally reported by the WHO Global Hepatitis Report (WHO 2017).

The incidence of new HCV infections remains high; there was an estimated 1.75 million
cases in 2015, particularly in resource-poor
countries mostly attributable to unsafe injections from both IV drug use and in some health
care settings. In these countries, the number of
new infections may largely outpace the number
of patients cured of their hepatitis C after antiviral therapy (Hill et al. 2017). Coupled with the
relentless progression of hepatitis C toward endstage liver disease, it is likely that in these areas
the burden of HCV will increase in the coming
years, jeopardizing the WHO goal of eliminating HCV as a public health threat by the year
2030. This article deals with the natural history
of hepatic and extrahepatic diseases associated
with HCV infection, and with the benefits of
HCV infection cure with direct-acting antivirals
(DAAs).
HEPATIC DISEASES: ACUTE HEPATITIS C
HCV mostly infects hepatocytes. Early after
acute infection, serum levels of HCV increase
rapidly to reach a plateau. Although HCV infection is not cytolytic, it triggers innate and adaptive immune responses. The cellular immune
response is the most prominent histological
hallmark of hepatitis C, mediating the killing
of infected and uninfected hepatocytes, in
synergy with an array of cytotoxic cytokines released by the local inflammatory infiltrate.
The biochemical correlate of this response is
the elevation of transaminases witnessing hepatocyte lysis.
A robust, broad HCV-specific CD8+ T-cell
response is reputed to play a pivotal role in eradicating the infection (Rehermann and Thimme
2019). On the other hand, HCV is capable to
mount complex strategies of evasion leading to
persistence in most patients. On average, only
25% of acutely infected patients clear the virus
(Grebely et al. 2014). Although a symptomatic
infection is an important predictor of viral
clearance (Gerlach et al. 2003), factors like female sex and HCV genotype may play a role
(Grebely et al. 2014). In addition, host genetic
factors contribute prominently to the fate of primary HCV infection (for review, see Gauthiez
et al. 2017). Genome-wide association studies
(GWAS) have consistently identified polymorphisms in IFNL3/IFNL4 as associated with HCV
clearance (Ge et al. 2009). Variants in MHC and
KIR genes (Suppiah et al. 2011) and the GPR158
(Vergara et al. 2019) additively predict clearance, whereas variants in other genes involved
in the immune response, such as IFNG-AS1 and
STAT1, seem relevant only among patients of
European ancestry (Huang et al. 2017). Of particular interest seem recent data on the role of

which 270,000 spontaneously cleared, whereas 1,228,000 persisted, thus contributing to the pool. At the same
time, an estimated 1,700,000 were treated with antivirals, of which 95% achieved sustained virologic response
(SVR), corresponding to 1,615,000 cleared infections. In addition, 342,000 died of liver-related deaths associated
with their HCV infection, whereas another 794,000 people infected with HCV died of non-liver-related causes
(an unknown of the latter causes included extrahepatic disorders caused by HCV; see text for further discussion).

some ERAP1 polymorphisms, because these
may alter the CD8+ T-cell repertoire (Kemming
et al. 2019).
Clinically, most cases of acute hepatitis C are
symptomless or characterized by nonspecific
symptoms, like fatigue or abdominal discomfort, and may proceed unnoticed. Severe hepatitis C, requiring hospitalization, is infrequent.
The role of HCV in acute liver failure is controversial but may be relevant when primary HCV
infection occurs in patients with a preexisting,
chronic liver damage, such as chronic hepatitis B
(Féray et al. 1993; Liang et al. 1993). So, the
clinical impact of acute hepatitis C is essentially
related to the high risk of chronicity.
HEPATIC DISEASES: CHRONIC
HEPATITIS C
Chronic hepatitis C is a progressing liver disease,
which may evolve to cirrhosis, usually after decades from infection. Cirrhosis caused by HCV
may then progress to decompensation, liver failure and/or HCC at a rate of 2%–6% per year.
These complications account for the majority of
liver-related morbidity and mortality associated
with HCV.
HCV induces fibrosis via two major mechanisms. First, fibrosis proceeds via a typical
wound-healing process that accompanies the inflammatory infiltrate elicited by the infection
(Bataller and Brenner 2005). This secretes soluble factors that activate hepatic stellate cells to
secrete collagen and indeed, the single most
important factor affecting the rate of fibrosis
progression is the extent of intrahepatic inflammation (Leandro et al. 2006). Accordingly,
patients with persistently normal alanine
transaminase (ALT) have little inflammatory
infiltrate and, on average, a slow liver disease
progression (Mathurin et al. 1998; Zeuzem
et al. 2006). Because a small minority of these
may have advanced liver disease, it has been
postulated that a second mechanism may
account for fibrosis deposition, that is, the direct
secretion of profibrogenic mediators—for example, the transforming growth factor β1—by infected hepatocytes (Schulze-Krebs et al. 2005).
This may then explain the frequent observation,
at liver histology, of extensive fibrosis with a remarkable paucity of infiltrate.
The variability of liver disease progression in
chronic hepatitis C patients is significant. The
fibrosis progression rate (FPR) is modified by
several factors, which may act alone or in combination, albeit to a different extent (Rüeger
et al. 2015), but the risk of HCC development
is also affected by diverse factors. As far as viral
factors are concerned, although the baseline serum HCV RNA level is not associated with
prognosis, HCV genotype 3 is associated with
accelerated FPR (Bochud et al. 2009; Probst et al.
2011). Patients with cirrhosis and HCV genotype 3 are at increased risk of end-stage liver
disease (McMahon et al. 2010) and HCC
(Kanwal et al. 2014).
However, more relevant liver disease modifiers are host and environmental factors. A
study assessing the FPR in African-Americans
versus Caucasian-Americans failed to show a
significant difference (Terrault et al. 2008). A
large Veterans Administration (VA) study,
however, showed that patients of Hispanic
ancestry were at the highest risk of having cirrhosis (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.28, 95%
confidence interval [CI] = 1.21–1.37) and HCC
(1.61, 95% CI = 1.44–1.80), whereas AfricanAmericans had a lower risk of progression to
both cirrhosis and HCC compared with nonHispanic whites, after adjusting for HCV genotype, HCV treatment, diabetes, body mass
index (BMI), and other factors (El-Serag et al.
2014). It is likely that genetics explains only in
part the variance in FPR attributed to ethnicity,
and that lifestyle and access to care may have
some impact as well.
Although the male sex is also associated with
accelerated FPR (Poynard et al. 1997) and increased incidence of HCC, after menopause, the
FPR risk also increases in women, via unclear
mechanisms (Di Martino et al. 2004). Women
with history of multiple pregnancies and those
receiving estrogen-replacement therapy are partially protected against accelerated fibrosis progression (Di Martino et al. 2004).
Several candidate gene studies have suggested a role for numerous host gene polymorphisms, alone or in combination, leading to the

elaboration of scores predictive of liver disease
progression. Among the variants found to affect
fibrosis progression, some lie in proximity of
IFNL3/IFNL4 and, interestingly, are the same
that are associated with an increased viral clearance. However, only a few polymorphisms have
been confirmed by more robust GWAS. A multicohort study (Patin et al. 2012) identified singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in RNF7 (a
gene encoding for an antioxidant protecting
against apoptosis), MERTK and TULP1 (two
factors involved in the phagocytosis of apoptotic
cells by macrophages), as associated with accelerated FPR. Additionally, several genetic variations within the MHC region are also predictive
of cirrhosis (Urabe et al. 2013). A more recent
meta-analysis of four independent cohorts, focusing on the attributable fraction of risk of accelerated FPR, identified the variants of TULP1,
PNPLA3, MERTK and within the MHC region
as being significantly and independently associated to FPR, with the SNPs in MERTK being the
most relevant in terms of attributable fraction
(14.4%) (Rüeger et al. 2015). The prognostic role
of SNPs in MERTK was confirmed by a longitudinal study (Jiménez-Sousa et al. 2018). On
the other hand, PNPLA3 variants are associated
with an increased risk of HCC (Valenti et al.
2011).
Age at infection is, by and large, the most
important feature affecting prognosis (Poynard
et al. 1997; Minola et al. 2002), contributing to at
least one-third of the FPR (Rüeger et al. 2015).
However, this should not underestimate the
unquestionable impact on both fibrosis progression and HCC development played by
modifiable factors, especially the excessive alcohol consumption (Poynard et al. 1997; Tagger
et al. 1999) and the metabolic syndrome (Veldt
et al. 2008; Bugianesi et al. 2012). Also, tobacco
and cannabis smoking may contribute to fibrosis progression, although the data is scantier
(Hézode et al. 2005; Mallat et al. 2008).
Finally, coinfections with hepatitis B virus
(HBV) and the human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) are of major clinical relevance, because of
the frequent overlapping of transmission routes.
HBV coinfection increases the risk of incident
HCC in cirrhosis patients (Tagger et al. 1999),
whereas FPR is accelerated in patients coinfected with HIV (Thein et al. 2008; Konerman et al.
2014), an outcome only partially prevented by
antiretroviral therapy (Deng et al. 2009). A low
CD4 count is also a risk factor for HCC (Ioannou et al. 2013).
HCV-ASSOCIATED EXTRAHEPATIC
DISEASES
HCV infection is associated with several extrahepatic manifestations (EHMs), although the
level of causality has not been definitely proven
for all of them (Table 1; Lodi et al. 2010; Negro
et al. 2015; Younossi et al. 2016a; Balakrishnan
et al. 2017; Ramos-Casals et al. 2017; Sayiner et
al. 2017; Segna and Dufour 2017; Cacoub et al.
2018a). These EHMs add significantly to the
HCV-related morbidity and mortality. As
many as 38%–76% of patients with chronic hepatitis C develop at least one EHM (Himoto and
Masaki 2012). Regrettably, the health burden
caused by HCV-induced EHMs has not received
the same attention as its liver-related outcomes,
probably in part because of the difficulty in estimating the mortality risk fraction directly
attributable to HCV. Many EHMs largely occur
and progress independently of HCV, such as
B-cell lymphoma or type 2 diabetes, and only
recently the relative contribution of the virus has
been appreciated owing to studies reporting on
the benefits of antiviral therapy.
Specific recommendations on the management of EHMs in HCV-infected persons exist
(Ramos-Casals et al. 2017). Although the current treatment indication is universal in case of
detectable HCV RNA (European Association
for the Study of the Liver 2018), the presence
of severe symptoms associated with EHMs are
one among many reasons for prioritizing antiviral therapy.
The causal link between EHMs and HCV
has been established based on epidemiological
and clinical data (Lee et al. 2012; Negro et al.
2015; Younossi et al. 2016a), whereas treatmentinduced viral clearance is associated with clinical improvement of many EHMs (Cacoub et al.
2018a). Furthermore, the availability of potent
interferon (IFN)-free regimens has made possiF. Negro

ble the treatment of patients in whom IFN was
contraindicated (e.g., with EHMs related to autoimmunity), hence providing the opportunity
to verify the causal association between infection and disease.
The pathogenesis of HCV-related EHMs
proceeds via diverse mechanisms, not necessarily involving the replication of HCV at extrahepatic sites, reported only in selected cases,
although data have not been independently
validated (Zignego et al. 2007; Fletcher and
McKeating 2012).
Extrahepatic Manifestations Related to
Chronic Immune Stimulation
Immunostimulation, autoimmune, or cytokinemediated mechanisms have been advocated
(Negro et al. 2015). Mixed cryoglobulinemia
(type II or III) is historically the first EHM to
have been found associated with HCV infection
(Pascual et al. 1990). Type II cryoglobulinemia is
rather specific of HCV, because up to 95% of
patients have HCV infection (Sene et al. 2004).
It is a lymphoproliferative disorder characterized
by the production and extravascular deposition
of immune complexes formed by monoclonal
and polyclonal immunoglobulins. According
to a meta-analysis, on average, ∼30% of hepatitis
C patients have cryoglobulinemia, with an 11-
fold increased risk versus controls (Younossi et
al. 2016a), although only ∼5% of patients may
present with the classical triad of symptoms
(fatigue, arthralgia, and palpable purpura).
Complexes tend to precipitate in small-to-medium-sized blood vessels, with a leukocytoclastic
vasculitis as the typical histopathologic hallmark. Several organs, primarily the skin but
also the central nervous system (CNS), gut, and
peripheral nerves, can be affected with clinical
consequences encompassing, respectively, atypical strokes, digestive bleeding, and sensitive
neuropathy.
Deposition of immune complexes may affect the kidneys, resulting in glomerulonephritis, mostly of the membranoproliferative type,
that may lead to kidney failure. There is a 26%
risk increase of developing chronic kidney disease in HCV-infected versus -uninfected persons, although not all of them are attributable
to cryoglobulinemia (Younossi et al. 2016a). In
any case, according to the recently revised
KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global
Outcomes) guidelines, all patients with chronic
kidney disease should be screened for HCV and,
conversely, all patients with hepatitis C should
undergo an assessment for the presence of kidney damage (Kidney International Supplements
2018). Another ominous complication is the occurrence of several subtypes of B-cell nonHodgkin’s lymphoma (Pozzato et al. 1994).
The risk of lymphoma is 60% higher in patients

with HCV infection compared with uninfected
controls (Younossi et al. 2016a).
Insulin Resistance and Diabetes
HCV is also associated with a higher risk of
developing type 2 diabetes (Bugianesi et al.
2012). This proceeds via the establishment of
peripheral insulin resistance and affects primarily patients who are already at risk for glucose
metabolism alterations, in whom diabetes may
develop at least one decade earlier than in uninfected persons (Mehta et al. 2003). In a recent
longitudinal study, HCV is an independent predictor of diabetes even after correction for transaminase elevations, suggesting that glucose metabolism disturbances are partly independent of
liver inflammation (Lerat et al. 2017; Lin et al.
2017). Chronic hepatitis C with type 2 diabetes
are at a higher risk of decompensated cirrhosis
(Elkrief et al. 2014) and HCC (Veldt et al. 2008).
Cardiovascular Disorders
Among the other prominent EHMs associated
with HCV, cardiovascular disorders merit a special mention as a significant cause of mortality.
The risk of cardiovascular disease in HCV is 20%
higher than among uninfected persons, whereas, more specifically, that of stroke is 35% higher
(Younossi et al. 2016a). Patients with HCV infection tend to develop surrogate markers of
cardiovascular mortality (intima-media thickness and carotid plaques) at an earlier age than
uninfected persons, especially if presenting with
advanced liver fibrosis (Petta et al. 2018).
Neurological Disorders
HCV infection has been associated with neuropsychiatric manifestations (Yarlott et al. 2017).
Indirect mechanisms of CNS dysfunction encompass the hepatic encephalopathy—a nonspecific condition affecting patients with advanced liver disease and portal hypertension
—and cerebritis, reported in occasional patients
with cryoglobulinemia (Cacoub et al. 2005).
However, a wealth of neurological and psychiatric alterations has been reported in hepatitis C
patients even in the absence of advanced liver
damage or cryoglobulinemia. The most prominent is fatigue (Goh et al. 1999; Poynard et al.
2002), the severity of which bears no correlation
with the liver disease activity or common parameters of autoimmunity. In a recent metaanalysis (Younossi et al. 2016a), the pooled
mean fatigue score was 3.90, that is, 1.60 points
higher than score reported by healthy controls,
suggesting a significant fatigue linked to HCV.
The pathogenesis is unclear. Although a study
has pinpointed an association with some inflammatory markers (Huckans et al. 2014), fatigue is a multifactorial condition, potentially
affected by several social and psychiatric factors
unrelated to HCV. Thus, it is impossible to establish a priori whether fatigue in any given patient is specifically linked to the viral infection,
or what the effect of a successful antiviral therapy will be.
Depression is another prominent condition
reported in chronic hepatitis C patients (Fontana et al. 2002), and has been a formidable
impediment to the widespread use of IFN-αbased therapies before the advent of DAAs
(EASL 2018). Based on a meta-analysis, the
risk of developing depression is about twofold
in HCV-infected versus uninfected controls
(Younossi et al. 2016a). Although depression
may be associated with drug abuse and thus
precedes HCV infection, an indirect viral effect
mediated by the host immune activation has
been suggested (Pawlowski et al. 2014).
A third complex of neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with HCV are collectively referred to as cognitive dysfunction (Forton et al.
2001). The role of viral infection in its pathogenesis has been disputed in the past, owing to the
fact that chronic hepatitis C patients may present with several confounding factors that may
result in cognitive impairment per se (e.g., drug
abuse or psychiatric conditions). However, recent data from clinical trials assessing cognitive
dysfunction longitudinally, that is, before and
after successful antiviral therapy, has allowed
confirming a viral pathogenesis for many such
symptoms (see below). Dysfunctions observed
in chronic hepatitis C patients include diminished concentration and attention span, imF. Negro

paired memory, poor speed of processing, and
learning efficiency (Yarlott et al. 2017), whereas
motor performance and visuospatial functions
seem relatively preserved, suggesting some specific mechanisms of damage (Weissenborn et al.
2004). Sophisticated imaging studies have analyzed the neuroanatomical basis of cognitive
dysfunctions linked to HCV, although the small
study size and the heterogeneity of the assessment protocols limit the robustness of findings.
The current evidence suggests that HCV may
not only induce brain inflammation, but, more
specifically, reduce brain metabolism and interfere with dopaminergic signaling (Yarlott et al.
2017).
Fatigue, depression, and cognitive impairment largely account for the reduction in
health-related quality of life (HRQOL) universally reported by chronic hepatitis C patients, a
finding that challenges the dogma of an asymptomatic condition usually attributed to chronic
hepatitis. A large body of evidence exists confirming the reduced HRQOL in chronic hepatitis C, irrespective of the assessment instrument.
In particular, demographic features and study
design do not affect HRQOL scores as do most
clinical features with the exception of cirrhosis,
which reduces the physical component score
(Younossi et al. 2016a). The mental health domains are those who score the worst (in particular, social functioning), compared with physical health domains (Younossi et al. 2016a).
Anxiety, stigmatization, and especially labeling
following diagnosis may play a role (Rodger et al.
1999), although this has been later disputed by a
study conducted in blood donors unaware of
their HCV serostatus (Strauss et al. 2014). The
recent clinical trials assessing HRQOL before
and after antiviral therapy have contributed significantly to clarify these issues (see below).
ADVENT OF DAAs AND THEIR IMPACT
ON HCV-RELATED MORBIDITY AND
MORTALITY
DAAs are not only very efficacious, but are also
characterized by a high level of safety. Contraindications and safety issues are rare. An important consequence is the ease of use also among
patients with severe liver dysfunction (with the
notable exception of protease inhibitors) or extrahepatic comorbidities. This has allowed the
unprecedented opportunity to reduce HCV-related morbidity and mortality in subgroups of
patients at high risk of fatal complications and in
whom IFN-α was contraindicated. I will outline
some of the most important observations related
to the impact of DAAs on the risk of liver decompensation, HCC, EHMs, and mortality.
SVR AND DECOMPENSATED CIRRHOSIS
The efficacy of DAAs in patients with decompensated cirrhosis became evident because of
early studies using a combination of sofosbuvir,
ledipasvir, and ribavirin (SOLAR-1 study)
(Charlton et al. 2015). In the following phase
III study (SOLAR-2), patients were randomized to the same combination given for 12 or
24 weeks. Among those with genotype 1 (the
vast majority of enrolled), SVR was achieved
by 20/23 (87%) child B patients with 12 weeks
of treatment and 22/23 (96%) child B patients
with 24 weeks of treatment, 17/20 (85%) of child
C patients (12 weeks of treatment), and 18 (78%)
of 23 child C patients (24 weeks of treatment)
(Manns et al. 2016). These regimens were also
sufficiently well tolerated, although the ribavirin
dose had to be adjusted frequently. The latest
combination of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir was
tested in a further clinical trial (ASTRAL-4).
Here, 267 patients with child B cirrhosis were
randomized to receive sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for
12 weeks without or with ribavirin, or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 24 weeks (Curry et al. 2015).
The SVR rates were, respectively, 83%, 94%, or
86%. Among the 250 patients with Child-PughTurcotte with data available at baseline and 12
weeks after the end of therapy, about one-half
improved their score. The MELD (model for
end-stage liver disease) score improved in 114/
223 (51%) of those with a score <15 at baseline,
and in 22/27 (81%) of those who had a score of
15 or higher.
These data were confirmed by real-world
studies (Table 2), which also analyzed in more
detail the clinical outcomes. The UK Expanded
Access Program showed a successful eradication

of HCV in 381/467 (81.6%) patients (409 with
decompensated cirrhosis at enrollment) (Foster
et al. 2016). Most importantly, in the follow-up
(FU) study, SVR was associated to a reduction in
incident decompensation events, from 28%

MELD score worsen. The improvement of liver
function and MELD score in patients with decompensated liver disease waiting for liver
transplantation may lead to patients’ delisting.
A European study showed that after achieving
SVR, one out of five candidates were removed
from the liver transplant waiting list because of
improved liver function (Belli et al. 2016). A
more recent reassessment of the ELITA (European Liver and Intestine Association) cohort,
based on a longer FU, showed that the proportion of delisted patients may be as high as 30.9%
(Perricone et al. 2018). Another recent study
from Spain confirmed these data, reporting
that about one-quarter of patients with decompensated cirrhosis were delisted because of an
improved MELD score (Pascasio et al. 2017).
Indeed, the extended use of DAAs in cirrhotic
patients, even before decompensation episodes
have occurred, has led to a significant decrease
of the proportion of patients with HCV infection listed for liver transplantation, both in the
United States, with a 30% decrease since the
introduction of DAAs (Flemming et al. 2017),
and in several European series (Crespo et al.
2018; Ferrarese et al. 2018; Vaziri et al. 2019).
The DAA-induced clinical benefit in patients with decompensated cirrhosis seems to
be limited to patients with a baseline MELD
score <18 (Fernández-Carrillo et al. 2017) or
<20 (Belli et al. 2016; Pascasio et al. 2017). Those
with higher scores were less likely to be removed
from the waiting list because of insufficiently
improved liver parameters. A decrease in
MELD score may not necessarily be sufficient
to delist patients or, even worse, it may lead to
delisting without being accompanied by an improved quality of life or a reduced risk of potentially lethal complications, such as rapidly progressing HCC (Perricone et al. 2018). Relisting
may also occur (Perricone et al. 2018). Thus, in
some cases, patients may no longer qualify for
liver transplant, while still being at risk of complications and even death, an untoward situation
that has be referred to as“MELD purgatory.” To
avoid this, guidelines have suggested to treat patients with DAAs only if the MELD score is
below 18–20, and to transplant first and treat
later if the MELD score is higher (EASL 2018),
although these rules should be modulated based
on local trends and availability of organ donors.
For example, patients with a MELD score ≥18–
20 and an expected waiting time before transplantation higher than 6 months may be treated
without delay.
SVR AND HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA
Several meta-analyses have shown that IFN-induced SVR is consistently associated with a
significantly reduced risk of developing HCC,
including among patients with previous HCC
ablative therapy (Ikeda et al. 1999; Morgan
et al. 2013; Moon et al. 2015). Because IFN
was limited to patients without advanced liver
damage, the introduction of safe and effective
DAAs allowed the evaluation of the benefit of
viral clearance on HCC incidence in advanced
cirrhosis. A first manuscript (Reig et al. 2016)
opened a fierce debate challenging this optimistic outlook, befuddling expectations. In a retrospective cohort study of 58 patients treated first
for HCC and then with DAAs, these investigators reported a staggering HCC recurrence rate
of 27.6% after a median FU of 5.7 months (Reig
et al. 2016). Despite some criticism (e.g., the
study was underpowered, the design was retrospective, and the limited FU was calculated using the time from DAA initiation instead of the
time from HCC treatment), these results were
supported by another study from Italy, with a
29% HCC recurrence rate after SVR (Conti et al.
2016). Here, in addition, the incidence rate of de
novo HCC was 3.16%, not dissimilar from historical rates in untreated patients. Other studies
soon followed, in which the incidence of HCC in
patients with SVR was relatively high (Cardoso
et al. 2016; Kozbial et al. 2018), whereas the
HCC recurrence rate in patients who had undergone ablative therapy was variable (Kolly
et al. 2017; Nagata et al. 2017; Shimizu et al.
2017; Hassany et al. 2018; Persico et al. 2018b;
Nishibatake Kinoshita et al. 2019). In some
studies, the HCC pattern of recurrence also
seemed unusually aggressive in terms of BCLC
(Barcelona Clinic for Liver Cancer) staging, vascular invasion, and short-term mortality, suggesting not only a potential lack of benefit of

HCV clearance on the incidence of de novo
HCC, but also an increased risk of rapidly progressing HCC after ablative therapy. Overall, it
seems as if IFN-based regimens provide an additional benefit, particularly in terms of protection against incidence of de novo liver cancer,
arguing in favor of an immunomodulatory effect
on top of a mere antiviral effect, such as that
afforded by DAAs (Bielen et al. 2017).
These data were not confirmed by all studies
(Bielen et al. 2017; Ioannou et al. 2017; Virlogeux et al. 2017). An important (although retrospective) study on 62,354 patients from the
VA (Ioannou et al. 2017) showed that DAA-induced SVR was associated with a significant reduction in de novo HCC risk, both in cirrhotic
and noncirrhotic patients. The analysis was adjusted for many confounders, encompassing all
major risk factors for HCC, including age, sex,
alcohol abuse, and diabetes. Most importantly,
these adjustments allowed fair comparisons between patients’ populations treated with IFNbased regimens versus those having been treated
with DAAs, known for having more advanced
liver disease. Thus, SVR was associated with a
significantly decreased risk of HCC irrespective
of the type of antiviral regimens, with a risk
reduction of 71% ( patients treated with DAAs
only), 52% (when treated with DAAs plus IFN),
and 68% (after treatment with IFN-based regimens but without DAAs).
An FU study also from the VA confirmed the
benefit of DAAs, although among patients with
SVR and cirrhosis, it remained clear that the
absolute risk of HCC remained somehow high
(1.82/100 person-years), requiring patients’ surveillance even after viral clearance (Kanwal et al.
2017). Another large study from Spain (Calleja
et al. 2017) reported a lower incidence of de
novo HCC (0.93%), a figure still far from zero.
Thus, the questions to be addressed are (1)
whether the risk of de novo HCC is indeed reduced by successful treatment with DAAs and to
what extent, which may influence the need (or
lack thereof ) for a strict surveillance after SVR,
and (2) whether treatment with DAAs in patients having received ablative therapy for HCC
may be protected from recurrence, and if not,
whether the recurrence rate may be higher and
characterized by the appearance of more aggressive tumors, potentially impacting survival.
These concerns were analyzed in a metaanalysis (Waziry et al. 2017) of 26 studies on
HCC occurrence and 17 on HCC recurrence.
The meta-regression adjusting for study FU
and age, DAA therapy was not associated with
higher HCC occurrence (risk ratio [RR] 0.68,
95% CI 0.18–2.55; P = 0.55) or recurrence (RR
0.62, 95% CI 0.11–3.45; P = 0.56), suggesting
that no evidence could be put forth supporting
a differential HCC occurrence or recurrence risk
following SVR from DAA and IFN-based regimens. These investigators rightly pointed out
how, at baseline, DAA-treated patients had a
higher HCC risk profile than IFN-treated patients, that is, they were older, had more advanced cirrhosis, and presented more frequently
with esophageal varices and low platelets,
among other features. Furthermore, in most
studies (i.e., 19 out of 24), the timing of FU for
HCC detection was calculated from the end of
antiviral treatment. A consequence of this was
that HCC cases undiagnosed at baseline were
more likely to be diagnosed as de novo HCC
whenever the antiviral treatment duration was
short (for DAAs, ranging from 12 to 24 weeks),
compared with long (a typical IFN-based schedule lasting up to 48 weeks). Thus, a higher HCC
risk together with its progressive decrease with
time (i.e., a typical cohort effect) corresponds to
a higher HCC risk profile at the start of DAA
therapy, and may be explained by the diagnosis
of HCC early after DAA therapy ends. Adjustment for age and FU time annulled the difference between DAA- and IFN-based regimens.
The investigators concluded that there is no evidence that DAA therapy is associated with
HCC development, and that clearance of HCV
following DAA therapy in patients with cirrhosis (63% in subgroup analysis) should afford the
same benefit (i.e., risk reduction), as an IFNbased therapy (77% in a historical meta-analysis) (Morgan et al. 2013). Following studies corroborated this view regarding the incidence of
de novo HCC, that is, once differences in severity (e.g., lower platelet counts, lower albumin,
previous episodes of decompensation, prior
treatment failure, or presence of esophageal varF. Negro

ices) or age are accounted for, the benefit of
DAAs is evident. This was shown by both retrospective (Innes et al. 2018; Li et al. 2018) and
prospective studies (Calvaruso et al. 2018; Nahon et al. 2018; Lleo et al. 2019; Pinero et al.
2019).
The French prospective CirVir cohort (Nahon et al. 2018), enrolling 1270 patients with
compensated, biopsy-proven HCV-associated
cirrhosis since 2006, merits a mention. Here,
the treatment effect of DAAs from the time until
HCC was evaluated by constructing a robust
time-dependent Cox regression model was
weighted by the inverse probability of treatment
and censoring (IPTCW). Patients receiving
DAAs were older, with more frequently diabetes, portal hypertension, or severe liver dysfunction. Although the crude 3-year cumulative incidence of HCC was 5.9% in the DAA group and
3.1% in the IFN-cleared group, after Cox analyses weighted by IPTCW, there was no statistically significant increase in risk of HCC associated with DAA use (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.46–
1.73). Furthermore, patients treated with
DAAs were also less likely to undergo strict surveillance. The investigators concluded that the
apparent increase in HCC incidence observed in
patients with cirrhosis treated with DAAs compared with patients who achieved SVR following
an IFN therapy can be explained by patient
characteristics (age, diabetes, reduced liver function) and lower screening intensity. The pattern
of aggressiveness of HCC was not increased at
the time of diagnosis in DAA-treated patients.
An additional prospective study on 3917 patients from Italy with advanced fibrosis showed
a yearly incidence of HCC comparable or slightly smaller to a historical untreated control
group, at least during the first year of FU, but
that this risk would further decline thereafter,
suggesting that early de novo HCC may be because of small, undetected HCC predating DAA
therapy, and that the DAA beneficial effect
would only be evident at a later stage (Romano
et al. 2018). The importance of the length of FU
was also suggested by another prospective study
from Japan on 401 patients without history of
HCC, followed for 12.7 months from SVR and
analyzed by a sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (Toyoda et al. 2019). This study failed to
show any difference in the incidence of hypervascularization or the new emergence of nonhypervascular hypointense nodule between
SVR and untreated patients, matched for propensity scores. The investigators concluded that
SVR did not promote HCC (Toyoda et al. 2019).
Possibly, the apparent lack of suppression may
have been related to the short FU after SVR, as in
the Italian cohort.
Finally, a vast prospective cohort study in
adult patients with chronic hepatitis C enrolled
at 32 expert centers across France (HEPATHER
cohort) (Carrat et al. 2019) analyzed 7344 patients treated with DAAs and followed for a
median of 33.4 months. Patients with decompensated liver disease were excluded (Figs. 2
and 3). Another 2551 patients remained untreated. In the adjusted multivariable analysis, compared with untreated patients (adjustments were
made, among other factors, for age, sex, BMI,
geographical origin, infection route, fibrosis
stage, being naive of HCV therapy, HCV genotype, alcohol consumption, diabetes, arterial hypertension), SVR after DAAs was definitely associated with a decreased incidence of HCC.
The above studies demonstrated a reduced
risk of de novo HCC (or at least the lack of increased risk, in some studies with short postSVR FU) in patients with cirrhosis treated with
DAAs. However, because a residual risk has
been shown in all studies, this raises the unresolved question of how to conduct appropriate
surveillance after SVR. It has been suggested that
patients with portal hypertension (esophageal
varices, lower platelet count) may be a candidate
for stricter surveillance, whereas those fulfilling
the extended Baveno criteria (i.e., platelets >110
G/L and liver stiffness measurement <25 kPa)
may have a relaxed surveillance (Lleo et al.
2019), although the precise modalities remain
to be established. In the CirVir cohort (Nahon
et al. 2018), before weighting for IPTCW, an
increased risk of HCC was observed in patients
who were older and had diabetes, indicating
which patients may benefit from closer surveillance, but the modalities of this are unclear.
Properly adjusted analyses on patients with
prior HCC therapy showed that the risk of HCC

recurrence and its aggressiveness do not seem to
be increased by DAA therapy (Guarino et al.
2018; Huang et al. 2018a,b; Mashiba et al.
2018; Ide et al. 2019), with a single important
exception from Egypt (El Kassas et al. 2018).
Clearly, there is increasing evidence that weighting methodologies are necessary to avoid biased
interpretations, and when applied properly
there is no evidence that DAAs increase the
risk of HCC, either de novo or recurrent after
ablative or palliative therapy. In the latter cases,
whether treatment with antivirals should be
started early or after HCC cure has been ascertained remains possibly the only open question.
EFFECT OF SVR ON EXTRAHEPATIC
MANIFESTATIONS
A recent meta-analysis (Cacoub et al. 2018a),
supported by a rigorous assessment of the quality of published evidence, reported that SVR is
associated with a ∼50% reduction in HCV-related extrahepatic mortality. This not only adds
to the evidence in favor of universal antiviral
treatment, but provides a strong evidence supporting the causal link between HCV infection
and EHMs. The issue has been debated for a
long time, mostly because of the fact that studies
assessing the effect of antiviral therapy on EHMs
were rarely randomized, but also in part because
of the inconsistency of case definition, or the
scarcity of data altogether, both in terms of
number of patients and of duration of postSVR FU.
Mixed Cryoglobulinemia, Kidney Disease,
and B-Cell Lymphoma
Early data were obtained with IFN-based regimens, which posed the known safety issues and
contraindications, preventing their expanded
use to more severe cases, especially if presenting
with severe kidney dysfunction. Moreover, some
manifestations associated with cryoglobulin
deposition seemed to be in part irreversible.
An important prospective study analyzed the
effect of a treatment with pegylated IFN-α and
ribavirin in 253 chronic hepatitis C patients with
mixed cryoglobulinemia (121 symptomatic) and
158 controls (Gragnani et al. 2015). Although
this study was primarily aimed at assessing
whether the presence of cryoglobulins may independently decrease the response to the above
combination, more importantly, its results confirmed that SVR was invariably associated with a
clinical response. On the other hand, the symptom improvement was not universal, because
21.1% of patients still reported weakness at the
end of FU, 18% still complained of sicca syndrome and 13.1% of peripheral neuropathy
(Gragnani et al. 2015). It is possible that in these
cases the long-standing deposition of cryoprecipitate in small and medium vessels may have
caused irreversible damage, with particular regard to vasa nervorum. This limitation of antiviral treatment was frequently observed also in
recent studies using DAAs. In the prospective
international multicenter cohort study of 148
patients with symptomatic HCV-related cryoglobulinemia vasculitis (The VASCUVALDIC3
study) (Cacoub et al. 2019), all treated with different DAA regimens, a complete response was
observed in 106 (73%), a partial in 33 (22.6%),
and no response in only seven patients (4.8%).
At the end of FU (lasting a median of 15.3
months), cryoglobulins disappeared in slightly
above one-half of patients, despite a 97% SVR
rate. Factors predicting lack of complete response included severity of damage and peripheral neuropathy. Although more long-term FU
studies are needed, a large-scale benefit on the
long-term consequences of the cryoglobulinemia syndrome, especially kidney damage and
B-cell lymphoma is expected to the same extent
as reported in patients treated with IFN-based
regimens (Mahale et al. 2018). However, early
treatment is to be advocated, that is, before irreversible end organ damage is constituted, because the size of the clinical benefit seems to be
inversely correlated with the time from diagnosis to antiviral therapy initiation (Mahale et al.
2018). Another limitation seems to be represented by the fact that B-cell clones persist in a “dormant” state long after SVR has been reached,
and that may reactivate leading to recurring cryoglobulinemia syndrome (Visentini et al. 2019).
The limited beneficial effect of antiviral-induced viral clearance is particularly serious in

patients with stage 4 and 5 chronic kidney disease. Treatment with a 12-week course of a combination of grazoprevir and elbasvir, or glecaprevir and pibrentasvir failed to result in
improved renal function in all dialysis patients
(Roth et al. 2015; Gane et al. 2017). However, in
the first study only two patients had cryoglobulinemia, whereas in the second trial no specific
information was provided.
B-cell lymphoma can be induced into remission by IFN therapy (Peveling-Oberhag et al.
2016; Cacoub et al. 2018a). In the DAA era,
data is still scarce, but the pattern seems to be
consistent with historical reports. An observational study on 46 patients with indolent B-cell
non-Hodgkin lymphoma (37 had marginal
zone type) or chronic lymphocytic leukemia
treated with different DAA regimens (Arcaini
et al. 2016). SVR was reached in 98% of cases.
A lymphoproliferative disease response was observed in 67% of patients and was complete in
26%. The 1-year progression-free and overall
survival (after a median FU of 8 months) was
75% and 98%, respectively.
The response seems favorable also in diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma, where DAAs were given
together with rituximab-containing chemotherapy (Persico et al. 2018a). The overall survival at
1 year was similar to a historical control group
not receiving antivirals. However, the diseasefree survival was better in patients treated with
DAAs. Importantly, there were no toxicity issues
deriving from the combinations of the antivirals
and chemotherapy agents. In another study
(Merli et al. 2018) on 47 consecutive patients
with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma treated with
DAAs concurrently or subsequently to chemotherapy (25% with cirrhosis), a complete tumor
response was observed in 46 cases. After a median FU of 2.8 years, two patients had died, corresponding to a 2-year overall survival of 97.4%.
Liver toxicity was more frequent in patients having received chemotherapyfirst; theinvestigators
argued for a concomitant administration.
Insulin Resistance and Type 2 Diabetes
SVR leads to a decreased level of insulin resistance and a reduced risk of incident diabetes and
its complications, such as end-stage renal disease, ischemic stroke, and retinopathy (Lee et al.
2012; Cacoub et al. 2018; Li et al. 2019). The
effect afforded by SVR induced by IFN seems
confirmed by the experience with DAAs (Li
et al. 2019). Glucose metabolic alterations are
overall improved after SVR induced by DAAs.
The beneficial effects encompass the fasting glucose level (Ciancio et al. 2018; Drazilova et al.
2018; Weidner et al. 2018), a reduced rate of
impaired fasting plasma glucose (Weidner et
al. 2018), and reduced hemoglobin A1C levels
(Ikeda et al. 2017; Ciancio et al. 2018). Some
diabetic patients may even reduce the dose of
antidiabetic medicines, if not suspending them
altogether (Dawood et al. 2017; Ciancio et al.
2018), although it is unclear whether this benefit
will be long-lasting. These benefits are independent of other factors such as presence of cirrhosis or BMI.
Cardiovascular Disorders
As far as cardiovascular outcomes are concerned, DAA-induced SVR seems to impact
some surrogate markers of cardiovascular outcomes. In a series of 182 consecutive patients
treated with DAAs (all SVR), intima-media
thickness decreased significantly at FU, together
with a reduction of the proportion of patients
with carotid thickening (from 43% to 17%)
(Petta et al. 2018). No changes were observed
for carotid plaques. Stratification of patients
for cardiovascular risk factors and liver disease
severity did not affect the results. The investigators concluded that clearance of HCV improves
carotid atherosclerosis, although they were cautious regarding the long-term clinical impact of
these data.
Neurocognitive Impairment
The advent of IFN-α-free treatment regimens
has allowed confirming the role of HCV in neuropsychiatric manifestations, which had for a
long time been a major obstacle to IFN-α therapy. In a large study encompassing data collected in 1952 on patients enrolled in three landmark clinical trials, assessing the efficacy of

sofosbuvir and ledipasvir with or without ribavirin (Younossi et al. 2015), HRQOL improved
as quickly 2 weeks after initiation of treatment,
in parallel with the inhibition of viral replication. For most patient-reported outcomes
(PROs) measured by the SF-36 and the FACIT-F instruments, an improvement bigger
than the minimal clinically important difference
was observed in about one-half of treated subjects at the end of therapy. The persistence of
HRQOL improvement after the end of therapy
was definitely proven by the large placebo-controlled clinical trial using a combination of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir (Younossi et al. 2016b).
PROs improvements persisted up to 24 weeks
after the end of active treatment, although they
were not noted among those who received placebo. The multivariable analysis, including clinical and demographic factors, also showed that
treatment-emergent modifications of PROs
were independently associated with the antiviral
therapy, at least for some summary scores. Fatigue, depression, and anxiety all improved with
successful therapy. Similar results were reported
for other antiviral regimens (Younossi et al.
2016c; Back et al. 2019). It is important to mention that these data on the amelioration of depression symptoms are at odds with a recent
meta-analysis assessing data on IFN-α-treated
patients (Cacoub et al. 2018a), possibly because
of the extensive difference among the treated
populations. On the other hand, data on the
effects of DAAs on brain metabolism are scanty.
A magnetic resonance spectroscopy analysis of
patients receiving sofosbuvir and ledipasvir
showed the normalization of cerebral N-acetyl
aspartate in patients in whom HCV was suppressed, suggesting a virally induced neuronal
dysfunction (Alsop et al. 2014).
Non-Liver-Related Mortality
Data on non-liver-related mortality is already
available. The retrospective analysis carried on
the large ERCHIVES, U.S. VA database (Butt
et al. 2019) identified 4436 chronic hepatitis C
patients who had been treated with pegylated
IFN-α and ribavirin and 12,667 treated with
DAAs. Treated patients were matched for age,
race, sex, and baseline values with untreated
control patients. Patients with cardiovascular
events at enrollment were excluded. The incidence of cardiovascular disorders was the lowest
among those treated with DAAs, that is, 16.3 per
1000 patient-years, approximately one-half as
many as observed in untreated controls, and
about one-third less than in patients receiving
pegylated IFN-α and ribavirin. Overall, SVR was
associated with a 13% decreased risk of incident
cardiovascular disorders, especially if treated
with DAA.
Three prospective cohort studies also support these observations. First, the above-mentioned prospective French cohort (Carrat et al.
2019) showed that, after appropriate and thorough adjustments, SVR after DAAs was associated with a decrease in all-cause mortality,
including both liver- and non-liver-related mortality. Importantly, because adjustments had
been made for markers of liver failure and comorbidities, and a sensitivity analysis excluding
the first 12 months of FU confirmed the overall
results, the investigators could reasonably rule
out a reverse causality, that is, the risk that patients may have been withheld DAAs if they
presented with a significant risk of death from
any cause other than liver-related.
The French ANRS/CirVir prospective study
of 1323 patients with compensated, histologically proven cirrhosis (enrolled between 2006 and
2012) and treated with different regimens (including DAAs) analyzed SVR versus non-SVR
patients matched for propensity scores and followed for a median of 58.2 months (Nahon et al.
2017). SVR patients had a reduced incidence of
HCC (−71%), decompensation events (−74%)
and cardiovascular events (−58%). The decrease
in mortality was also significant (−73%), for
both liver- and non-liver-related causes.
Finally, in a prospective cohort study of
878 patients with histologically proven cirrhosis
without history of decompensation (Cacoub
et al. 2018b) treated with a variety of regimens
(including DAAs) and followed for a median of
57.5 months, 62 had incident major cardiovascular events. The multivariate analysis
showed that SVR was an independent predictor
of decreased risk of events (HR = 0.35, 95% CI

0.09–0.97; P = .044). Asian ethnic origin, arterial
hypertension, smoking, and low serum albumin
level were predictors of events. In addition, the
5-year survival was 60.1% in patients with cardiovascular events versus 87.5% in patients
without (P < .001).
Evidence showing the specific effect of
DAAs on other less frequent EHMs is scanty.
Small sample size, retrospective study design,
and lack of control of untreated arms characterize most cases series. Because DAA regimens are
now used without restrictions in elimination
strategies, data on less frequent EHMs will become common with time.
CONCLUSIONS
Several prospective studies using DAAs have
now shown the benefit of viral clearance induced
by these agents in terms of hard clinical outcomes, that is, liver- and non-liver-related mortality. The benefit is clear when compared with
properly matched, untreated cohorts. With regard to EHMs, data suggest that viral clearance
should be reached earlier than later. Thus, this
adds to the current evidence supporting universal treatment, irrespective of disease stage. Considering also the benefit deriving from improved
quality of life, reduced risk of onward transmission, and other social and economic gains, the
overall social return from the resources invested
in treating all HCV-infected patients (i.e., irrespective of their clinical profile) is unquestionable, and fully supports the WHO goal of eliminating HCV as a public health threat by the year
2030.
