Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) constitutes a diverse group 
of malignancies emerging in the biliary tree. CCAs are 
divided into three subtypes depending on their anatomical site of origin: intrahepatic (iCCA), perihilar (pCCA) 
and distal (dCCA) CCA1,2 (Fig. 1). Of note, considered 
as an independent entity, mixed HCC–CCA tumours 
are a rare type of liver malignancy sharing features of 
both iCCA and HCC and presenting an aggressive disease course and poor prognosis3,4
. iCCAs arise above the 
second-order bile ducts, whereas the point of anatomical distinction between pCCA and dCCA is the insertion of the cystic duct. pCCA and dCCA can also be 
collectively referred to as ‘extrahepatic’ (eCCA)5
. In the 
USA, pCCA is the single largest group, accounting for 
approximately 50–60% of all CCAs, followed by dCCA 
(20–30%) and iCCA (10–20%)1,6,7
. CCA is the second 
most common primary hepatic malignancy after hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), comprising approximately 
15% of all primary liver tumours and 3% of gastrointestinal cancers1,6,7
. CCAs are usually asymptomatic in early 
stages and, therefore, often diagnosed when the disease 
is already in advanced stages, which highly compromises 
therapeutic options, resulting in a dismal prognosis1,8
. 
CCA is a rare cancer, but its incidence (0.3–6 per 100,000 
inhabitants per year)1
 and mortality (1–6 per 100,000 
inhabitants per year, globally9
, not taking into account 
specific regions with incidence >6 per 100,000 habitants 
such as South Korea, China and Thailand) have been 
increasing in the past few decades worldwide, representing a global health problem. Despite advances in

Abstract | Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) includes a cluster of highly heterogeneous biliary malignant 
tumours that can arise at any point of the biliary tree. Their incidence is increasing globally, 
currently accounting for ~15% of all primary liver cancers and ~3% of gastrointestinal malignancies. 
The silent presentation of these tumours combined with their highly aggressive nature and 
refractoriness to chemotherapy contribute to their alarming mortality, representing ~2% of all 
cancer-related deaths worldwide yearly. The current diagnosis of CCA by non-invasive approaches 
is not accurate enough, and histological confirmation is necessary. Furthermore, the high 
heterogeneity of CCAs at the genomic, epigenetic and molecular levels severely compromises 
the efficacy of the available therapies. In the past decade, increasing efforts have been made to 
understand the complexity of these tumours and to develop new diagnostic tools and therapies 
that might help to improve patient outcomes. In this expert Consensus Statement, which is 
endorsed by the European Network for the Study of Cholangiocarcinoma, we aim to summarize 
and critically discuss the latest advances in CCA, mostly focusing on classification, cells of origin, 
genetic and epigenetic abnormalities, molecular alterations, biomarker discovery and treatments. 
Furthermore, the horizon of CCA for the next decade from 2020 onwards is highlighted.

CONSENSUS
Statement
NAture RevIewS | GASTROENTEROLOgy & HEPATOLOgy

CCA awareness, knowledge, diagnosis and therapies, 
patient prognosis has not improved substantially in the 
past decade, with 5-year survival (7–20%) and tumour 
recurrence rates after resection still disappointing10–17. 
Therefore, a detailed study of these types of cancers is 
urgently needed to improve patient welfare and outcomes. Considering the high heterogeneity of CCAs, 
individual characterization of these tumours at the 
genomic, epigenetic and molecular levels is an indispensable approach to ascertain their pathogenesis, paving 
the path for new therapeutic options and personalized 
medicine. In this expert Consensus Statement, which 
is endorsed by the European Network for the Study of 
Cholangiocarcinoma (ENS-CCA), we provide a comprehensive and critical overview of current knowledge 
and what is envisaged on the horizon for CCA, focusing on epidemiology, risk factors, clinical presentation, 
diagnosis, genetic and epigenetic landscape, molecular 
perturbations, chemoresistance and therapies.
Methods
This international group of multidisciplinary experts in 
CCA (that is, oncologists, surgeons, hepatologists, geneticists, immunologists, basic scientists) has been intensively collaborating within the ENS-CCA since 2015 
with the main aims of improving our understanding of 
CCA and the management of patients. In this regard, 
this expert consensus is endorsed by the ENS-CCA. 
The overall goal of this multidisciplinary statement is 
to provide a detailed critical overview of the current 
knowledge in this field, proposing some expert recommendations and highlighting what is envisaged for the 
next decade.
J.M.B. and G.J.G. identified the areas of interest, 
stratified the consensus statement into the sections presented in the document and assigned them to selected 
ENS-CCA members or non-European collaborators 
(L.R.R., S.G., S.I.I., J.H. and G.J.G.) who are expert in 
each field of knowledge and research. To write this document, a PubMed search was conducted by combining 
the term ‘cholangiocarcinoma’ with the following terms: 
‘epidemiology’, ‘risk factors’, ‘classification’, ‘cells of origin’, ‘diagnosis’, ‘staging’, ‘genetics’, ‘epigenetics’, ‘signalling pathways’, ‘epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition’, 
‘cancer stem cells’, ‘tumour microenvironment’, ‘immunobiology’, ‘in vitro and in vivo models’, ‘biomarkers’, 
‘surgery’, ‘liver transplantation’, ‘therapies’, ‘clinical trials’ 
and ‘chemoresistance’. No specific search dates were 
used. All the sections were merged into a first draft by 
P.M.R and J.M.B. and then extensively revised to create 
the final document that was later circulated among 
all the authors for further correction, improvement, discussion and approval. The data presented in Fig. 2 were 
obtained by combining the values of mortality rates in 
men and women for both iCCA and eCCA reported 
in 2019 by Bertuccio et al.9
. For the recommendations 
on CCA management and research priorities, ideas were 
proposed, discussed and approved after final revision by 
all the authors to reach a consensus.
Epidemiology and risk factors
The global mortality for CCA increased worldwide 
during the periods 2000–2004, 2005–2009 and 2010–
2014 (Fig. 2), according to the WHO and Pan American 
Health Organization databases for 32 selected locations 
in Europe, America, Asia and Oceania9
. Furthermore, 
CCA mortality was higher in men than in women worldwide, and in countries/regions in Asia versus those in 
the West. Accordingly, Asian individuals were reported 
to have the highest mortality (2.81 per 100,000 men 
in Japan). However, in the USA, the more noticeable 
increases in mortality between 2004 and 2014 were 
found for African American individuals (45%), followed 
by Asian (22%) and white (20%) individuals18. The 
age-standardized incidence of CCA shows considerable 
geographical variation, with the highest incidence in 
Eastern countries/regions; incidence varies from 85 per

100,000 in northeastern Thailand (the highest reported 
value globally) to 0.4 per 100,000 in Canada12. Variations 
in incidence probably reflect differences in local risk 
factors and potential genetic predispositions1,2,19.
The three subtypes of CCA can have different risk 
factors, pathobiology, clinical presentations, management and prognosis, as well as distinct epidemiological trends1,2
. Over the past few decades, the reported 
age-standardized incidence for iCCA has been steadily increasing in most locations worldwide, whereas 
the age-standardized incidence for eCCA has been 
decreasing2,19. However, these trends need cautious 
interpretation given that all versions of the main 
International Classification of Diseases (ICD) have so far 
failed to include a separate code for the largest group of 
CCA (pCCA) and previous versions of ICD–Oncology 
(ICD-O) have cross-referenced pCCA (technically 
extrahepatic) to iCCA. Importantly, for the first time, 
subsequent iterations of both ICD and ICD-O (ICD-11 
and ICD-O-4, respectively) — which are due to come 
into effect by 2021 — will have separate codes for recording iCCA, pCCA and dCCA20. Having clearly defined 
codes for the three subtypes of CCA might facilitate 
more accurate and meaningful epidemiological data. 
In the meantime, reported epidemiological trends for 
CCA and/or biliary tract cancer need to be interpreted 
carefully.
Furthermore, in the USA, the incidence of iCCA is 
higher in older people (≥45 years old) than in younger 
people and in Hispanic individuals than in non-Hispanic 
individuals, and is associated with a worse 5-year 
survival in both these populations21. Worse overall survival (OS) rates have also been reported for African 
Americans, followed by American Indians and Alaska 
Native groups21,22. Of note, the hospital charges associated with iCCA management almost doubled from 
2005 to 2014 in the USA22, and male patients with low 
annual incomes (<US$37,999) tended to show shorter 
OS, pinpointing socioeconomic treatment discrepancies 
that clearly affect outcome23. Other factors that affect 
the interpretation of CCA incidence trends include the 
unknown effects of improved diagnostics (imaging, 
endoscopy, histology), greater awareness and the acceptance of performing a biopsy even when imaging is 
highly suggestive of HCC (in accordance with current 
guidelines), and increasing the detection of combined 
HCC–CCA or iCCAs3,24–28. Furthermore, there is substantial global variation in rates of microscopically verified (that is, histologically or cytologically confirmed) 
cases of CCA reported to cancer registries worldwide. 
For example, Khon Kaen in Thailand, despite being 
believed to have the highest overall age-standardized 
incidence of CCA worldwide, has one of the lowest morphologically verified percentages (only 9% of all cases of

Fig. 1 | Anatomical classification of cholangiocarcinoma. On the basis of the anatomical site of origin, 
cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is classified into intrahepatic CCA (iCCA), perihilar CCA (pCCA) and distal CCA (dCCA). 
iCCA is defined as a malignancy located in the periphery of the second-order bile ducts, pCCA arises in the right 
and/or left hepatic duct and/or at their junction, and dCCA involves the common bile duct (that is, the choledochus). 
Grossly, CCA can show three main patterns of growth: mass-forming, periductal-infiltrating, and intraductal-growing. 
Mass-forming CCA is a mass lesion in the hepatic parenchyma. Periductal-infiltrating iCCA grows inside the duct wall 
and spreads longitudinally along the wall. Intraductal-growing CCA is a polypoid or papillary tumour growing towards 
the duct lumen.

liver disease)29. In this regard, CCA can be notoriously 
difficult to accurately diagnose due to its location often 
being inaccessible to histology or cytology, a lack of clear 
diagnostic imaging criteria, and inaccurate non-invasive 
tumour biomarkers1,2
.
Several risk factors, both common and rare, have 
been linked to CCA (Table 1). Although some risk factors 
are shared by all forms of CCA, others seem to be more 
specific for one subtype and seem to be more important 
in different regions. A common characteristic amongst 
many of these risk factors is that they are associated with 
chronic inflammation of the biliary epithelium and bile 
stasis19. Several recognized risk factors have increased 
globally over recent decades (1990–2016) and could 
be contributing to increasing CCA rates. For instance, 
high alcohol consumption, tobacco smoking and viral 
infections (hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus 
(HCV)) have been reported to increase the risk of CCA 
development30. Moreover, it is also important to highlight the global obesity pandemic, as well as the metabolic syndrome and/or presence of nonalcoholic fatty 
liver disease, as risk factors that deserve future central 
attention30. However, in most locations, the majority of 
CCA cases remain sporadic, without any identifiable 
risk factor present. A number of studies are examining 
the potential influence of commonly used drugs such as 
aspirin31–33 and lipid-lowering statins34,35 in the prevention of CCA. Notably, post-diagnosis aspirin usage has 
been found to be associated with a reduced risk of death 
(HR 0.71) among patients with CCA36. Polymorphisms 
of host genes encoding enzymes involved in xenobiotic detoxification, DNA repair, multidrug resistance, 
immune response and folate metabolism have been 
linked to CCA development19. There are currently no 
published genome-wide association studies (GWAS) 
in CCA, but an appropriately powered one is eagerly 
anticipated.
Classification and cells of origin
iCCA can emerge at any point of the intrahepatic biliary 
tree, ranging from bile ductules to the second-order bile 
ducts (segmental bile ducts). In contrast to HCC, iCCA 
usually develops in non-cirrhotic liver37. pCCA can arise 
in the right and/or left hepatic duct and/or at their junction (so-called perihilar bile ducts)38, and dCCA involves 
the common bile duct39. The current term eCCA is now

discouraged as it combines subtypes with distinct clinicopathological features, prognosis and therapeutic 
options, and also due to the difficulties in discriminating 
between intrahepatic and extrahepatic origins of pCCA.
iCCA can show three main patterns of growth: massforming, periductal-infiltrating, and intraductalgrowing1,38 (Fig. 1); pCCA and dCCA present as flat 
or poorly defined nodular sclerosing tumours or, less 
frequently, as intraductal papillary tumours40. CCA can 
be preceded by pre-invasive lesions39. Histologically, 
although the vast majority of pCCA and dCCA are 
conventional mucin-producing adenocarcinomas or 
papillary tumours40, iCCA shows several histological 
variants (that is, conventional, cholangiolocarcinoma 
and rare variants)41 (Fig. 3; Table 2). Conventional iCCA 
can be further classified into two main histological 
subtypes according to the level or size of the affected 
duct42–46 (Fig. 3; Table 2). Small bile duct iCCA presents 
as a small-sized tubular or acinar adenocarcinoma with 
nodular growth invading the liver parenchyma, and 
with no or minimal mucin production42–46. Large bile 
duct iCCA arises in large intrahepatic bile ducts and 
comprises mucin-producing columnar tumour cells 
arranged in a large duct or papillary architecture38,46–49. 
Remarkably, the histological subtyping parallels the high 
molecular heterogeneity of CCAs and can be ascribed 
to different cells of origin and pathogenesis41. Small bile 
duct iCCA can be characterized by isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1, IDH2) mutations or fibroblast growth 
factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) fusions40,50–55. By contrast, 
large bile duct iCCA, similar to pCCA and dCCA, 
shows a high frequency of mutations in KRAS and/or 
TP53 genes51,53,56,57. Interestingly, dCCA is also associated 
with ELF3 mutations58. Growing evidence demonstrates 
that distinct cells of origin within an organ can give rise 
to different subtypes of cancer, typically tissue-specific 
stem and progenitor cells59–62. Evidence regarding the 
cells of origin of CCA in humans was obtained by phenotyping the candidate tissues and/or cells of origin with 
respect to CCA subtypes through histological and gene 
expression analysis38,44,46,63–68, whereas indirect evidence 
might be derived from risk factors67,68.
Small bile duct and cholangiolocarcinoma iCCA 
subtypes emerge at the level of smaller intrahepatic 
bile ducts, including bile ductules38,44,46,69. In these portions of the biliary tree, hepatic stem or progenitor cells 
(HpSCs) and cuboidal cholangiocytes represent surface 
epithelium and are the putative cells of origin of these 
malignancies38,44,46,69 (Fig. 3; Table 2). Interestingly, HpSCs 
have been implicated in CK19+ HCC70 and in combined 
HCC–CCA4,64,71. Notably, CCA-like HCC tumours display embryonic stem cell-like expression traits, further 
substantiating the involvement of bipotent hepatic progenitor cells, and in humans display a worse prognosis 
than HCC72. In line with these findings, nestin, a maker 
of bipotent progenitor oval cells, is greatly increased 
in HCC–CCA tumours and is associated with a worse 
prognosis, and has been proposed as a new possible 
diagnostic and prognostic biomarker3,26. Small bile duct 
and cholangiolocarcinoma iCCA usually develop on a 
background of chronic liver disease (such as chronic 
viral hepatitis and cirrhosis)38,46,70, characterized by 
HpSC activation71,73,74.
Large bile duct iCCA, pCCA and dCCA derive 
from columnar mucous cholangiocytes or peribiliary 
glands38,44,46,47,49,69 (Fig. 3), which are also implicated in 
the origin of precursor lesions (such as intraductal papillary neoplasm)46. These malignancies mainly develop 
in ducts affected by chronic inflammation as in primary 
sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) or liver fluke infection46,49,69.

In PSC, peribiliary gland cell proliferation, mucinous metaplasia, and dysplasia to cancer progression 
take place within bile ducts and along the biliary tree, 
mimicking the cancerization field (‘field defect’)49,75.
Controversies exist regarding the cellular origins of 
iCCA based on lineage tracing studies in experimental carcinogenetic models76. Indeed, there is evidence 
in favour of HpSC, cholangiocyte or hepatocyte origin 
of iCCA from these experimental settings76–81. Thus, 
a definitive determination of the origin of iCCA in 
humans cannot be reached based on current evidence 
and requires further research. Moreover, it should be 
underlined that current experimental models of liver 
damage do not fully recapitulate the pathogenesis of 
human chronic liver disease, including proliferative 
senescence in hepatocytes66,82,83, and that lineage 
tracing studies must be conducted and interpreted 
cautiously76,84–87.
Clinical presentation
Diagnosis
CCAs are usually asymptomatic during early stages. The 
most frequent symptom of pCCA and dCCA is jaundice 
due to biliary tract obstruction88. In iCCA, jaundice is 
less frequent and mostly associated with advanced 
disease. Other symptoms of advanced disease include 
asthenia, abdominal pain, malaise, nausea, anorexia 
and weight loss. iCCA is an incidental finding in around 
20–25% of cases88. In patients with cirrhosis, ultrasonography surveillance for HCC enables iCCA diagnosis

Fig. 3 | Histological classification and putative cells of origin in cholangiocarcinoma. Based on the duct size, the 
intrahepatic biliary tree can be further subdivided into small and large intrahepatic bile ducts (iBDs). Small iBDs are lined 
by small cuboidal cholangiocytes whereas columnar and mucous cholangiocytes line large iBDs. Typically, large iBDs 
contain peribiliary glands within their wall. The extrahepatic biliary tree shares anatomical features with large iBDs. 
Histological cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) variants reflect the phenotype of the involved duct and the putative cell of origin. 
Conventional intrahepatic CCA (iCCA) has two main variants: small duct-type iCCA arises in small iBDs with cuboidal 
cholangiocytes representing the putative cell of origin, and large duct-type iCCA involves large iBDs and is considered to 
be derived from columnar cholangiocytes and peribiliary glands (seromucous glands; mucous acini are shown in light pink, 
serous acini are shown in green). Cholangiolocarcinoma (CLC) is a frequent histological variant of iCCA and its phenotype 
suggests the origin from bile ductules or ductular reaction (DR) that occurs in chronic liver diseases. The vast majority of 
perihilar CCA (pCCA) and distal CCA (dCCA) are considered to originate from the lining epithelium and peribiliary glands. 
This histological subtyping underlies distinct clinicopathological and molecular features as summarized in Table 2.

at an asymptomatic, early stage89. Unfortunately, the 
majority of iCCA cases occur in the absence of known 
risk factors90, when the only chance for early diagnosis is 
by cross-sectional imaging performed for other reasons.
Imaging techniques, such as ultrasonography, 
contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS), CT and 
MRI, play a key part in the management of CCA in 
terms of diagnosis, staging, follow-up and assessment 
of treatment response. Their diagnostic accuracy is 
influenced by the anatomical location and growth patterns of CCA, and their use for staging varies according to tumour location91. CT is considered the standard 
imaging method for the preoperative assessment of both 
iCCA and pCCA; it provides a comprehensive evaluation of the primary tumour, the relationship with adjacent structures, and potential thoracic and abdominal 
spread91. MRI has similar accuracy to CT for diagnosis 
and staging, but it incorporates specific sequences such 
as diffusion-weighted imaging and the potential for performing magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography 
(MRCP), which is critical for pCCA staging92. The most 
frequent imaging patterns displayed by iCCA on both 
CT and MRI are arterial peripheral rim enhancement 
with progressive homogeneous contrast agent uptake 
until the delayed or stable uptake during late dynamic 
phases93,94. A targetoid pattern defined as arterial rim 
enhancement, peripheral washout and delayed central enhancement can also be present in iCCA95. When 
gadoxetic acid is used, the washout should be read in 
the portal phase instead of in delayed phases to prevent 
misclassification between HCC and iCCA in a cirrhotic 
liver96. More controversial is the use of CEUS in iCCA, 
particularly in the setting of underlying chronic liver 
disease. iCCA exhibits homogeneous arterial hyperenhancement followed by venous washout in near 50% 
of patients, a pattern indistinguishable from that found 
in HCC94,97. However, in a relevant proportion of patients 
with iCCA, washout takes place earlier than 60 s after 
contrast agent injection; this feature is rarely observed in 
HCC, and the intensity of washout in the portal phase is 
more marked in iCCA than in HCC89. These refinements 
might decrease the risk of misdiagnosis in HCC98, and 
have been adopted by the Liver Imaging Reporting Data 
System (LI-RADS) for CEUS (LI-RADS-CEUS)99. No 
evidence supports the use of 18F-FDG PET for completion of staging, which could be of special value to exclude 
the presence of lymph node or distant metastases100.
As no specific CCA radiology pattern exists, histopathological or cytological analysis is mandatory to 
confirm the diagnosis1,28. This diagnosis is based on the 
WHO classification of biliary tract cancer showing an 
adenocarcinoma or mucinous carcinoma101, with tubular and/or papillary structures and a variable fibrous 
stroma102.
Staging
There is no widely used staging system for CCA, 
although it can be staged according to the American 
Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM system103,104. 
Despite providing a clinically meaningful classification correlated with prognosis105, the current TNM 
classification has some limitations. First, it has limited 
discriminatory ability between T2 and T3 tumours in 
surgically resected iCCAs105,106. T2 tumours include 
multifocal disease or disease with intrahepatic vascular 
invasion that probably reflect disseminated disease and 
the OS in patients with these tumours does not differ 
from the OS in patients with extrahepatic metastatic 
disease105. Similarly, there is also evidence supporting 
the negative effect of the presence of multifocal iCCA 
(iCCA with liver metastases; T2) on prognosis (OS) 
when compared with other early stages, which might 
require consideration in future versions of the AJCC 
TNM classifications107. Second, although size has been

included for the first time as a prognostic factor for iCCA 
in the eighth edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, 
the only cut-off size considered is 5 cm in T1 tumours. 
Several authors have shown that a 2 cm cut-off value 
might identify very early tumours with very low likelihood of dissemination and potential long-term survival 
with low recurrence rates24,108. Finally, the TNM classification misses relevant prognostic factors such as the 
presence of cancer-related symptoms (such as abdominal 
pain or malaise) or the degree of liver function impairment. As previously shown with HCC, future proposals from society guidelines should focus on stratifying 
non-surgical patients for clinical studies using clinical 
and imaging data. Notably, Chaiteerakij et al. proposed a 
new staging system for pCCA based on tumour size and 
number, vascular encasement, lymph node and peritoneal metastasis, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
(ECOG) performance status (ECOG-PS), and CA19-9 
level, which has shown a better performance in predicting survival than the TNM staging system109. Also, 
important for stratification in clinical trials, radiographic 
staging parameters need to be developed in the absence 
of histological staging, and a radiographic staging system 
has been proposed for pCCA109.
Genetics and epigenetics
Genomics
Initial efforts using integrative genomics approaches to 
stratify CCA based on prognosis have highlighted extensive deregulated transcriptomic landscapes showing augmented anti-apoptotic signalling, angiogenesis, signal 
transduction and transcriptional control8,110. The main 
oncogenic networks comprised WNT-CTNNB1, MYC, 
ERBB, TNF and VEGF signalling, emphasizing cell 
survival signalling pathways in patients with poor OS8
. 
Regarding genomic alterations, CCA falls midway in 
the mutational spectrum of cancers111, with an approximately equal content of genomic alterations in iCCA 
(median 39 non-synonymous mutations per tumour) 
and eCCA (median 35 non-synonymous mutations 
per tumour)56. Massive sequencing studies56,112–121 have 
improved our understanding of the causal mechanisms 
in CCA, emphasizing the genomic complexity in prevalent oncogenic modules affecting: cell cycle regulation; 
DNA damage and genomic instability (TP53, CDKN2A, 
CCND1, ATM, ROBO2, BRCA1 and BRAC2); MYC 
amplification; epigenetic regulation including NADPH 
metabolism (IDH1 and IDH2), de-ubiquitination 
(BAP1), SWI–SNF complex (PBRM1, ARID1A, ARID1B, 
ARID2, SMARCA2, SMARCA4 and SMARCAD1) and 
histone (de-)methylation (MLL2, MML3, KMT2C, 
KDM4A, KDM5D, KDM6A and KDM6B); kinase 
signalling (KRAS, ERBB1–3, BRAF, PIK3CA, PTEN, 
STK11, SMAD4 and FGFR1–3); immune dysregulation 
(JAK–STAT3 signalling); FGFR2 and PRKCA–PRKCB
fusions; the WNT–CTNNB1 pathway (APC); Hippo 
signalling (NF2, SAV1 deletion); METLL13 amplifications; and deregulated Notch signalling. Interestingly, 
the predominant genomic alterations in CCA are associated with epigenetic processes122. Indeed, the most 
clinically significant genomic breakthroughs in iCCA 
are the discovery of hotspot IDH mutations (IDH1R132
and IDH2R172) that cause an accumulation of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG)57, as well as the 
constitutive active gene fusion event between FGFR2 and 
many different partners, including the most prevalent 
(BICC1 (refs50,112–114), PPHLN1 (ref.
115), TACC3 (ref.112)
and MGEA5 (ref.
112)). These alterations are important as 
they are driving current marker-based phase III clinical 
trials testing specific agents targeting these alterations in 
FGFR2 fusion-positive CCA (NCT03773302)123,124 and 
IDH-mutated CCA (NCT02989857).
To date, information on the inherited predisposing 
genetic risk factors causing CCA is very limited125. Data 
mostly stem from GWAS of patient cohorts diagnosed 
with PSC25,126, with increased risk of CCA. However, the 
only detailed genomic association with aetiological risk 
factors investigated by genome sequencing has been the 
association with liver fluke infection (Opisthorchis viverrini and Clonorchis sinensis), with fluke-positive tumours 
showing an overall higher mutational rate (median 
4,700 versus 3,143 somatic mutations per tumour)116
with prevalent mutations in SMAD4 and TP53 as well 
as ERBB2 amplifications116–118. Furthermore, although 
not in a high proportion, KRAS mutations have been 
recurrently found in all CCA subtypes56,116,117. A statistically significant association has also been observed 
between TP53 mutation and HBV infection119,120. Few 
studies have investigated the molecular distinction 
between iCCA, pCCA and dCCA8,56,116,121. Nakamura 
et al. emphasized the difference in anatomical location of the tumour, highlighting IDH, EPHA2 and 
BAP1 mutations and FGFR2 fusions in iCCA, whereas 
extrahepatic tumours specifically show PRKACA and 
PRKACB fusions as well as mutations in ELF3 (similar to 
tumours in the ampulla of Vater)127 and ARID1B56. Based 
on these fundamental causal alterations, tumours in distinct anatomical sites should probably be treated differently. Besides linking IDH mutations with the response 
to ivosidenib128, few studies have related genomic 
alterations to high-throughput drug screening119,129,130. 
Among these, Nepal et al. used an approach of integrative genomics in a large cohort of iCCAs to elucidate 
unique mutational signatures, structural variants and 
epigenomic alterations, emphasizing specific oncogenetic mechanisms in four distinct subsets of patients 
with potential drug responses and categories: RNA synthesis inhibition, IDH mutant; microtubule modulator, 
KRAS mutant; topoisomerase inhibition, TP53 mutant; 
and mTOR inhibitors119.
Epigenetics
Epigenetics was shown to play an important part in the 
initiation and progression of CCA, affecting tumour phenotype in the absence of changes in DNA sequences131. 
Deregulated patterns of methylation, histone modifications and aberrant expression of non-coding RNAs 
promote unbalanced transcription and gene expression 
that impair cell homeostasis and sustain malignant 
transformation. Growing evidence supports deregulated 
methylation motifs in CCA cells compared with their 
normal counterparts, with a prevalent hypermethylation of multiple CpG sites occurring in CCA132,133. One 
of the largest studies of integrative genetic and epigenetic

analyses in CCA, including 489 CCAs from ten countries/regions, has shown how the molecular make-up of 
CCA goes beyond the differentiation according to anatomical site116. Indeed, by combining DNA sequencing 
with transcriptomic and DNA methylation analyses, 
four clusters of CCA with different clinical outcomes 
were identified. Two sets of hypermethylated CCAs 
stood out, with an interesting association between CpG 
island hypermethylation and liver fluke-related tumours, 
increased mutation rate, downregulation of the DNA 
demethylation enzyme TET1, upregulation of the histone methyltransferase EZH2 and an increased level of 
deamination events. Conversely, the subgroup of iCCAs 
with enrichment in IDH1/2 and BAP1 mutations, as well 
as FGFR translocations, showed hypermethylation of 
the CpG shores (the regions immediately flanking CpG 
islands, up to 2kb away). This different pattern suggests 
how early epigenetic deregulation caused by external 
carcinogenic events (for example, liver flukes) are at the 
basis of CCA development in the first cluster, whereas in 
the second cluster, epigenetic aberrations probably arise 
as a downstream consequence of somatic mutations 
(IDH) that produce oncometabolites responsible for the 
DNA hypermethylation. These differences have remarkable clinical implications, because on the one hand early 
epigenetic events might be used for early detection of 
tumours in the first cluster (by using quantitative DNA 
methylation markers in the bile of individuals at risk)80
and on the other hand, the tumour clonal mutations 
might be a marker of effective targeted therapies (such 
as IDH inhibitors).
Methylome data can also provide insights into the 
cells of origin of CCA. Tumours with high genetic and 
epigenetic occurrence seem to have an enrichment 
of events within embryonic stem cell-related bivalent 
regulation134–136. IDH-mutated tumours instead seem to 
resemble the profile of cholangiocellular CCAs that show 
gene expression traits of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)136. Histone modifications have been less 
studied in CCA. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes 
are responsible for regulation of histone acetylation that 
ultimately affects chromatin organization. HDAC were 
found to be upregulated in CCA in vitro137, and are being 
investigated as targets of treatment. Evidence also suggests that HDAC inhibitors, as well as dasatinib, might 
be particularly active in IDH-mutated tumour cells129,130. 
Non-coding RNAs account for around 98% human RNAs 
and include microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding 
RNAs, among others. These non-coding RNAs regulate 
the expression of a plethora of target genes affecting 
all the hallmarks of the cancer phenotype from cell proliferation and migration to EMT and the regulation of the 
primary cilium in cholangiocytes138–142 (Fig. 4).
Signalling and molecular networks
CCA often arises in the setting of prolonged biliary 
inflammation and/or cholestasis, which contribute to 
carcinogenesis. According to transcriptomic profiles, 
the ‘inflammation’ (38%) and ‘proliferation’ (62%) subtypes of iCCA were previously identified and reported 
to be differentially enriched with activation of the proinflammatory and oncogenic pathways, respectively110. 
The inflammation subclass of tumours was characterized by induction of immune-related signalling pathways. By contrast, the proliferation subclass was enriched 
in classic oncogenic pathways, including deregulated 
EMT or migration or invasion

receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signalling, RAS–RAF–
ERK, PI3K–AKT–mTOR, insulin growth factor 
receptor 1, MET, polo-like kinase 1, aurora kinase A, 
KRAS mutations and stem-like genomic traits as well 
as a focal deletion in the Hippo pathway (SAV1)8,110,143. 
Notably, patients with the proliferation subtype of iCCA 
displayed decreased OS (median 24.3 months versus 
47.2 months for those with the inflammation subtype; 
P=0.048).
Cholangiocarcinogenesis is orchestrated by a 
complex interplay of extracellular ligands (such as 
pro-inflammatory cytokines, growth factors and bile 
acids, among others), which are present in the tumour 
microenvironment (TME), and increased expression 
and/or aberrant activation of cell surface receptors and 
the deregulation of intracellular signalling pathways, 
finally leading to cell proliferation, survival and genetic 
and/or epigenetic alterations (Fig. 5).
Chronic inflammation and fibrosis facilitate cholangiocyte transformation in a multistep manner, providing extracellular ligands that modulate several signalling 
pathways. In particular, sustained IL-6–STAT3 signalling 
was shown to contribute to mitogenesis by upregulating myeloid cell leukaemia 1 (MCL1) or altering EGFR
promoter methylation144,145. Similarly, bile acids are not 
genotoxic but might also promote cholangiocarcinogenesis through a mechanism involving the activation of 
EGFR, induction of COX2, MCL1 and IL-6, and downregulation of farnesoid X receptor (FXR)146,147. Of note, 
FXR expression was reported to be decreased in human 
CCA tumours compared with surrounding normal liver 
tissue, correlating with tumour differentiation140. By contrast, the levels of TGR5, another bile acid receptor, were 
found to be increased in CCA tumours and to be correlated with a worse prognosis (perineural invasion)140.

Fig. 5 | Signalling pathways involved in cholangiocarcinoma development and progression. The process of cholangiocarcinogenesis, and further tumour evolution and growth, involves complex and heterogeneous processes that include the 
interplay of extracellular ligands (such as pro-inflammatory cytokines, growth factors and bile acids, among others), which 
are present in the tumour microenvironment, and increased expression and/or aberrant activation of cell surface receptors 
and the deregulation of intracellular signalling pathways, finally leading to cell proliferation, survival and migration or 
invasion. The most common genes that might be mutated or amplified resulting in the overactivation of some of these 
pathways are KRAS, BRAF, ARID1, PBRM1, BAP1, IDH1 and IDH2. The activation of these signalling pathways might also 
occur as a result of the interaction between the tumour epithelia and the tumour reactive stroma. 2-HG, 2-hydroxyglutarate;

derived factor 1 (SDF1), platelet-derived growth factor 
(PDGF)-B and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins148.
Although there are marked differences in the 
genomic features depending on the anatomical location and risk factors, activation of the RTK signalling 
pathway is a common event in CCA across subtypes. 
In this regard, aberrant EGFR, ERBB2 and MET RTK 
expression has been found in different CCA subclasses 
that are associated with worse prognosis8,110. RTK signalling mainly triggers the activation of the RAS–MAPK 
and PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathways. Furthermore, RAS–
MAPK pathway activation due to KRAS-activating 
mutations is found in all CCAs without distinction, 
whereas BRAF mutations are more prevalent in iCCA149. 
Interestingly, chromosomal oncogenic gene fusion 
rearrangements involving FGFR2 RTK occur almost 
exclusively in iCCA50,52,56,112,113. Besides FGFR2 fusions, 
ROS1 kinase protein fusions have also been identified 
in iCCA150. Thus, RTK signalling pathways present 
actionable molecular alterations that are amenable 
for therapeutic targeting at multiple levels. IDH1 and 
IDH2 encode metabolic enzymes that interconvert 
isocitrate and α-ketoglutarate51,53,113,117,151. Mutations in 
IDH1 and IDH2 lead to the production of high levels 
of 2-hydroxyglutarate, an oncometabolite that interferes with histone and DNA demethylases and inhibits the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Indeed, 
IDH-mutant CCAs were shown to exhibit high levels of 
mitochondrial and low levels of chromatin modifier gene 
expression, such as low ARID1A expression due to DNA 
hypermethylation121. Besides epigenetic silencing, inactivating mutations in multiple chromatin-remodelling 
genes (including BAP1, ARID1A and PBRM1) are 
common in iCCA151.
Developmental pathways, including Notch, WNT 
and transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) signalling 
pathways are prominently active in iCCA compared with 
HCC, as shown by integrated microarray analysis152. 
During liver repair and in inflammatory conditions 
(known risk factors for iCCA), signalling pathways 
involved in biliary development are activated in ductular reactive cells, including Notch, WNT, Hippo–YAP 
and Hedgehog. The Notch pathway is known to be 
involved in biliary repair, growth, tubulogenesis, fibrosis and maintenance of the stem cell niche; defective 
Notch function due to JAG1 or NOTCH2 mutations 
causes impaired regeneration and Alagille syndrome153, 
whereas increased Notch activity has been associated 
with primary liver tumours154. Overexpression or aberrant Notch receptor expression has been reported both 
in iCCAs and eCCA, including pCCA and dCCA155–157. 
Activation of Notch signalling was shown to mediate 
transdifferentiation of hepatocytes into cholangiocytes 
during carcinogenesis79–81,158. In this regard, experimental 
overexpression of the intracellular domain of NOTCH1 
receptor (NICD1) in hepatocytes has been associated 
with the development of iCCA in mouse models79,80,158. 
Similarly, inhibition of NOTCH2, the expression of 
which has been shown to be related to well-differentiated 
iCCA155, markedly reduced tumour burden in various 
mouse models of liver cancer (including iCCA)81,159, 
whereas overexpression of NOTCH3 was associated with 
the development and progression of iCCA, promoting 
cell survival via PI3K–AKT signalling160. Several Notch 
inhibitors are being developed, and their availability 
increases interest in this pathway161.
The WNT–β-catenin signalling pathway is also 
known to be activated in most CCAs, in part as an effect 
of the release of Wnt ligands by inflammatory macrophages infiltrating the stroma162,163, but also as a consequence of DNA methylation alterations targeting this 
pathway133 and/or mutations encoding key components 
of the canonical WNT–β-catenin signalling pathway164. 
Notably, the promoter of the WNT–β-catenin pathway 
inhibitor SOX17 was hypermethylated in CCA tumour 
tissue compared with healthy tissue, correlating with a 
worse prognosis after tumour resection132. Noteworthy, 
SOX17 was shown to regulate cholangiocyte differentiation and to act as a tumour suppressor in CCA in vitro132. 
WNT inhibitors successfully inhibit tumour growth in 
experimental models163 and clinical trials with agents 
targeting this pathway are currently being explored164. 
The Hippo–YAP signalling pathway regulates organ size 
and cell proliferation, among other functions165. YAP is 
a transcriptional co-activator that is usually inhibited 
by Hippo (MST1 or MST2), but can be activated by 
Hippo-independent signals, such as inflammation and 
changes in ECM composition and stiffness166. Several 
groups have reported increased nuclear expression of 
YAP in CCA specimens and correlation with a worse 
prognosis167–169. In vitro studies on CCA cell lines have 
shown that YAP can be activated by IL-6, PDGF and 
fibroblast growth factor170,171. PDGF and fibroblast 
growth factor form a feed-forward loop activating 
YAP; YAP transcriptional targets are genes of these signalling pathways, such as FGFR1, FGFR2 and FGFR4
(refs170–172). Genetic alteration of the YAP pathway seems 
to be uncommon in CCA, according to an integrative 
genomic analysis of CCA specimens121. However, mutations in ARID1A have been reported in up to 14% of 
CCAs149. ARID1A encodes a subunit of the SWI–SNF 
chromatin-remodelling complex that among other 
functions reduces YAP transcriptional activity173.
EMT, stemness and plasticity
EMT is a cell plasticity-promoting phenomenon initially 
reported to occur during embryogenesis, but that also 
takes place in cancer, enabling epithelial cancer cells to 
acquire mesenchymal features with invasive properties that lead to metastatic colonization174. The prototype inducer of EMT is the TGFβ-dependent pathway, 
whose signature has been identified in iCCA stroma8,175. 
In CCA, TGFβ induces EMT directly or cooperates with 
other major EMT inducer pathways such as EGFR176,177. 
During this plastic EMT programme, tumour cells lose 
their epithelial traits and gain mesenchymal features178. 
Although initially considered as a binary process, it is 
now well established that epithelial cells undergoing 
EMT become mesenchymal in a gradual manner, known 
as partial EMT178,179. Thus, EMT is a dynamic process 
NAture RevIewS | GASTROENTEROLOgy & HEPATOLOgy volume 17 | September 2020 | 567
ConSenSuS S tatement

that gives rise to intermediate cellular states with both 
epithelial and mesenchymal traits, contributing to cell 
heterogeneity and a broad range of functions from 
cancer initiation to progression178,179. Notably, EMT is 
orchestrated by transcription factors (EMT-TFs), comprising SNAIL, ZEB and TWIST family, that regulate the 
expression of epithelial and mesenchymal genes180. CCAs 
express EMT-TFs, which are associated with poor prognosis regardless of anatomical localization181. Beyond the 
EMT programme, EMT-TFs display pleiotropic roles 
linking EMT to stemness, metabolic reprogramming, 
immune evasion and drug resistance178,182,183.
Increasing evidence suggests associations between 
EMT and acquisition of cancer stem cell (CSC) properties in different cancer types65,184, and this might also 
contribute to CCA heterogeneity as well as resistance to 
anticancer drugs. Importantly, CSCs represent a peculiar subcompartment of the tumour cell population 
crucially involved in recurrence, metastasis and drug 
resistance185–187. A growing body of evidence indicates 
that CSCs express EMT traits in human CCAs65,187–189. 
Interestingly, CCA emerging in patients with PSC are 
characterized by EMT features and high expression of 
stem and/or progenitor cell markers in peribiliary glands, 
suggesting a connection between EMT and stemness in 
tumour initiation49. Indeed, EMT-TFs, such as ZEB1, 
regulate expression of CSC markers by inhibiting miR200 family members, well-known potent stemness 
repressors190. In stem-like iCCA, a signature linking 
miR-200c with EMT regulators such as ZEB1 and TGFβ 
has been identified191. Besides EMT, TGFβ is known to 
promote stemness in CCA cells in vitro (human CCA 
cell line TFK-1)192. A statistically significant correlation between TGFβ1 and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 
(ALDH1), a functional CSC marker, has been found in 
both iCCA and eCCA192. Furthermore, TGFβ-induced 
EMT resulted in acquisition of mesenchymal traits, 
ALDH expression and resistance to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 
in vitro192. Moreover, new evidence suggests that cell plasticity promoted by the EMT programme confers immunosuppressive effects on carcinoma cells by mechanisms 
not completely understood178; one mechanism identified 
so far is the regulation of the immune checkpoint PD1 
ligand (PDL1) by ZEB1 in breast cancer cells193.
Tumour microenvironment
CCA tumours contain a diverse range of cellular types 
(Fig. 6). Although the tumour epithelium is considered as 
the coordinator of tumour growth, the importance of the 
TME cannot be understated. Histopathologically, CCA 
is typified by an extensive cellular and acellular stroma 
that can comprise the bulk of the tumour194. CCA shares 
many characteristics with scars that form around bile 
ducts in premalignant disease, as usually found in PSC 
and congenital hepatic fibrosis, suggesting that the origin of the tumour stroma can be found in the regenerative microenvironment during bile duct repair195. The 
CCA stroma consists of cancer-associated endothelial

Fig. 6 |Central role of cancer-associated fibroblasts in promoting tumour growth and metastasis of cholangiocarcinoma.
Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are recruited and persistently activated by cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) cells, in response 
to the effects of PDGF-D, and of FGF and TGFβ1, also released by tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs). In turn, CAFs 
enhance cell proliferation and the invasive ability of CCA cells directly, or by influencing the activity of other cells in the tumour 
microenvironment. CAFs stimulate tumour-associated lymphangiogenesis (lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC)), support M2 
polarization of TAMs and the activation of regulatory T (Treg) cells, while dampening the activity of CD8+
 T cells, natural killer (NK) 
and dendritic cells. CAFs also induce heavy remodelling of the extracellular matrix (ECM), which becomes stiffer and affects 
mechanotransduction of CCA cells, leading to activation of intracellular pathways, including YAP–TAZ. Soluble factors 
mediating each cell–cell interplay are shown in boxes of different colours according to their origin (orange from CAFs, green 
from CCA cells, light blue from TAMs, red from ECM). Mediators in bold are those with proven effects, the rest are putative 
signalling molecules. CAF-derived short-range (Hedgehog (Hh)) and direct (NOTCH3) cell–cell developmental cues also 
underlie interactions with CCA cells (lower right corner).TH2 cell, T helper 2 cell.

cells, CAFs and a complex group of inflammatory cells, 
including macrophages, neutrophils, natural killer 
(NK) and T cells196. In addition to this complex cellular 
microenvironment, the tumour stroma also contains an 
extensive network of ECM proteins such as collagens, 
laminin and fibronectin197,198. The TME directly interacts 
with the cancer epithelium to support epithelial proliferation and tumour growth, among which CAFs have been 
the most extensively investigated.
Cancer-associated fibroblasts
CAFs are a heterogeneous population of spindle-shaped 
cells with mesenchymal origin that contribute to tumour 
progression in many human cancers199. In CCA, the 
abundance of CAFs positively correlates with tumour 
growth and poor survival200. CAFs most likely originate 
from several different cells types, namely tissue-resident 
portal fibroblasts, hepatic stellate cells, pericytes, bone 
marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells and monocyte 
precursor-derived fibrocytes via transdifferentiation and 
activation181,201,202. This activation process also results in 
a metabolic reprogramming that enhances proliferation, cellular motility, as well as secretion of regulatory 
molecules and components of the ECM. Importantly, 
although CCA cells express mesenchymal markers they 
do not transdifferentiate into CAFs, but they do secrete 
PDGF-D to stimulate fibroblast migration203. In CCA, 
the persistent activation of fibroblasts is induced primarily by TGFβ, fibroblast growth factor and PDGF, which 
are released from tumour-associated macrophages 
and CCA cells204. TGFβ was reported to be pivotal in 
promoting an iCCA-desmoplastic phenotype in a 3D 
rat organotypic culture model205, and targeting the 
TGFβ pathway in thioacetamide-treated rats improved 
fibrosis and reduced CCA burden206. CAFs secrete 
a multitude of signalling molecules (such as IL-1β, 
PDGF-B, heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor and 
SDF1) that promote cancer progression by enhancing 
proliferation, survival, chemotaxis and angiogenesis148. 
Furthermore, CAFs have also been shown to promote 
CCA growth through short-range and direct cell–cell 
morphogenetic signals, such as NOTCH3 (ref.
160) and 
Hedgehog207. By secreting immunomodulatory factors, CAFs can also promote an immunosuppressive 
TME208: they regulate innate immunity by supporting 
M2 macrophages, and decreasing NK cell activation. 
Regarding adaptive immunity, CAFs promote regulatory T cells and T helper 2 cells, and disable dendritic 
cells and cytotoxic T cells208. Data support the ability 
of CAFs to interact with lymphatic endothelial cells209. 
Following stimulation by PDGF-D originated from the 
tumoural cholangiocytes in vitro, CAFs secrete VEGF-A 
and VEGF-C, which recruit and assemble lymphatic 
endothelial cells in vascular structures susceptible to 
tumour cell intravasation209.
Cell interactions within the TME are favoured by 
the ECM, which is gradually ‘transformed’ into a compact and stiff scaffold, enabling mutual communications and exchange of paracrine factors between the 
different cell elements210. The ECM is continuously 
remodelled by deposition of newly synthesized matricellular proteins, including tenascin C, osteopontin and 
periostin, in concert with an intensive degradation by 
matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs; MMP1, MMP2, 
MMP3 and MMP9) that are copiously released by 
CAFs, tumour-associated macrophages and malignant 
cholangiocytes210. Thanks to these phenotypic changes, 
ECM boosts key pro-invasive functions of tumour cells. 
In cooperation with collagen I, tenascin C and integrins 
(α5β1, α5β3, α5β5 and α6β4), periostin stimulates cell 
proliferation of malignant cholangiocytes in a PI3K–
AKT-dependent manner in vitro211. Increased ECM 
stiffening is also instrumental in the activation of intracellular mechanosensors, such as YAP–TAZ, involved in 
tumour initiation and progression. Whereas soft ECM 
inhibits YAP–TAZ activity by favouring its sequestration by the SWI–SNF chromatin-remodelling complex 
through ARID1A, stiff ECM induces YAP–TAZ to 
detach from SWI–SNF and to bind to TEAD, unfolding 
a transcriptional programme and promoting cell proliferation, CSC traits, plasticity and reprogramming173,212. 
Overall, the multifaceted interplay of CAFs with tumour 
cells, immune cells, lymphatic endothelial cells and ECM 
is continuously evolving (Fig. 6) and could offer potential 
therapeutic targets. Importantly, selective pro-apoptotic 
targeting of CAFs with subsequent reduction in tumour 
growth and lymph node metastases has been demonstrated in a CCA rat model213. Overall, the signalling 
networks that govern CCA tumours are the result of the 
intrinsic genomic and epigenetic alterations of tumour 
cholangiocytes, as well as their interplay with CAFs, 
immune cells and ECM. The secretion of proinflammatory, oncogenic and fibrogenic factors from CCA cells 
could contribute to the recruitment of other cells to the 
TME, which in turn will activate and sustain specific signalling pathways in cancer cells, thus perpetuating CCA 
growth and progression.
Immunobiology
Transcriptomic sequencing of CCA tumours has 
demonstrated that the subset of patients with the poorest 
prognosis have an elevated tumour mutational load and 
enhanced expression of immune checkpoint molecules56. 
Importantly, the presence of T cell-infiltrated TMEs, 
characterized by infiltration of CD8+ T cells, chemokines and molecules responsible for T cell priming 
and immune infiltration, is associated with higher 
response to immune checkpoint blockade, whereas 
non-T cell-infiltrated TMEs have poorer responses214,215.
Regarding innate immune responses, activated 
or ‘M2-like’ tumour-associated macrophages are 
anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive. M2-like 
macrophages stimulate WNT signalling with consequent CCA progression163, and are associated with 
inferior patient outcomes216,217. High numbers of M2 
tumour-associated macrophages are linked to poor 
disease-free survival in patients with iCCA217. Similarly, 
in a retrospective study of patients with pCCA who 
had undergone surgical resection, high density of 
tumour-associated macrophages in the tumour invasive front correlated with increased local and tumour 
recurrence216. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells are 
another immunosuppressive element in the TME. 
Fibroblast activation protein-positive (FAP+) CAFs

promote myeloid-derived suppressor cell infiltration in 
desmoplastic tumours218. Moreover, increased stromal 
FAP expression in human resected CCA specimens has 
been linked to poor patient outcomes218. The presence 
of CD83+ dendritic cells in human resected CCA specimens was associated with better outcomes219. Although 
NK cells comprise 30–40% of all hepatic lymphocytes220, 
current knowledge on the role of these cells in CCA is 
limited. Culture of CCA cells (human CCA cell lines, 
Hucct1 cells and OZ cells) with the anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab augmented CCA cell death 
via NK cell-induced antibody-dependent cellular 
cytotoxicity221. Similarly, infusion of ex vivo-expanded 
human NK cells in CCA mouse xenograft models 
resulted in tumour regression222.
CCA progression has been associated with a decrease 
in the components of the adaptive immune response223. 
Immunohistochemical analyses have demonstrated 
a preponderance of CD8+ T cells within the tumour 
and CD4+ T cells in the tumour–liver interface224, as 
well as an association with longer OS and the presence 
of tumour-infiltrating CD4+ or CD8+ T cells223,225–227. 
Similarly, the presence of B cells has been linked to a 
favourable prognosis in CCA223,224. Factors associated 
with a higher likelihood of response to immune checkpoint blockade include the presence of biomarkers such 
as PDL1, genetic aberrations such as DNA mismatch 
repair (MMR) deficiency and/or microsatellite instability (MSI), and the cumulative tumour mutational 
burden2
. On the basis of small cohorts of patients with 
CCA (range 41–104 patients across the studies), PDL1 
is expressed in 42–72% of tumours228–230, and seems to 
be present primarily on immune cells228,229. MMR deficiency has been reported in 5% of pCCA or dCCAs and 
10% of iCCAs231. Of note, hypermutation was found in 
6% of CCAs and MMR deficiency and/or MSI was present in 36% of these hypermutated tumours56. MSI-high 
tumours are generally ‘hot’ tumours with an increased 
number of neoepitopes, CD8+ T cell infiltration, and 
improved responses to immune checkpoint blockade 
in cancer generally215. In a cohort of 86 patients with 
MMR-deficient tumours, including four patients 
with CCA, immune checkpoint blockade with the antiPDL1 monoclonal antibody pembrolizumab resulted in 
a complete response in one of the patients with CCA 
and stabilization of disease in the other three232. These 
data indicate that immune-directed therapies including 
immune checkpoint blockade are a promising approach 
for, at least, this subset of patients with CCA.
In vitro and in vivo experimental models
Over the past decade, a number of in vitro and in vivo 
models of cholangiocarcinogenesis have been generated 
to clarify the phenotypic, biochemical and biological 
events occurring during the transformation of normal cells into fully malignant cholangiocytes (Table 3). 
In vitro cell lines, mainly derived from human CCA 
specimens, have been used widely as a tool to study 
this disease76,233–235. Cell lines exhibit various advantages 
over animal models: they are free from non-tumourous 
and necrotic tissues, their growth can be synchronized, 
relatively high numbers of cells can be produced, cell 
proliferation and apoptosis can be accurately determined, and they can be molecularly modified (that is, 
by overexpression or silencing of genes, using antisense 
oligonucleotides, small interfering RNAs, CRISPR–Cas, 
and so on), therefore enabling the study of single genes 
or signal transduction pathways. Furthermore, cell lines 
can be subjected to drug administration. However, 
in vitro passaging renders cell lines increasingly different from the original tumours. Primary cultures of CCA 
cells from tumour tissue are used shortly after derivation 
and grown under serum-free growth factor-enhanced 
conditions; therefore, more closely resembling the 
in vivo situation236,237. Unfortunately, important shortcomings also apply to this system; in particular, primary cultures are time-consuming and elimination of 
non-tumour cells can be complicated. Furthermore, primary cultures can only be established from surgically 
resected specimens, limiting the applicability to a subset of patients with CCA who have undergone surgery. 
Also, primary culture cells lack realistic intercellular and 
cell–matrix interactions236,237. Importantly, preneoplastic 
(for example, PSC-derived cholangiocytes) and/or normal cholangiocyte primary cultures should be used as 
controls132,140,238,239.
To recapitulate more adequately the in vivo tumour 
tissue structure and to investigate the interaction 
between CCA and the TME, 3D model systems, 
known as tumour spheroids and organoids, were 
developed240,241. Tumour spheroids are self-assembled 
cultures of cancer cells in the presence or absence of 
stromal cells within a hydrogel, mimicking the basement 
membrane, where cell–cell interactions predominate 
over cell–substrate interactions241. By contrast, tumour 
organoids are self-organizing stem cell-like structures 
cultured and expanded in a hydrogel76,242,243. Organoids 
are successfully established from resected tissue biopsy 
and needle biopsy samples, faithfully recapitulating the 
patient tumour at the histopathological level, both in 
culture and as xenografts in immune-deficient mice242,244. 
However, to recapitulate CCA tumours in  vivo, 
organoids should be co-cultured with stromal cells. 
Importantly, whole-exome sequencing revealed that 
the vast majority of the mutations are retained in liver 
cancer organoids derived from resected tissues, whereas 
mutation retention is heterogeneous in biopsy-derived 
liver cancer organoids76,242,243. Furthermore, CCA organoids have been shown to be a reliable system for drug 
testing and personalized medicine applications, and 
possess an almost negligible capacity to differentiate 
into hepatocytes76,245. As an alternative method, CCA 
organoids can be established by inducing genetic mutations in healthy organoids via viral transduction and 
CRISPR–Cas9 genome editing approaches, thus enabling the characterization and elucidation of the roles of 
oncogenes and/or tumour suppressor genes, either alone 
or in combination, in cholangiocarcinogenesis76,246.
Mouse models of CCA enable the investigation of 
the pathobiology of the disease and treatment response 
in a context that more closely recapitulates the human 
disease76,247–249. Multiple approaches have been used 
to induce CCA formation in mice and the principal 
mouse models can be classified into four major groups:

chemically induced models, in which a chemotoxic 
drug is responsible for the oncogenic insult(s); genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM); implantation 
models; and transposon-based models. As human CCA 
can develop in the setting of a diseased liver, various 
methods have been developed to mimic liver alterations, such as those induced in humans by viral hepatitis, 
chronic inflammation and cholestasis, further increasing the similarity with the human situation. Another 
major advantage of in vivo models is that they enable 
the study of CCA starting from early pre-neoplastic to 
fully progressed lesions, meaning researchers can dissect the specific molecular events occurring at various 
stages of cholangiocarcinogenesis. In addition, in vivo 
models enable real-time monitoring of tumour development and response to therapies using imaging modalities such as CT or MRI, or other techniques involving 
bioluminescence.
Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers
The current ‘omics’ era is enabling the discovery of new 
and promising biomarkers in biofluids (serum, urine, bile, 
saliva) and tumour tissue that could change the paradigm 
in disease diagnosis and management in the upcoming 
years (Supplementary Figure 1).
Circulating nucleic acids found in biofluids after active 
transport or resulting from dying cells are promising diagnostic and prognostic tools for human disorders250–252. 
Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has been envisaged as mirroring 
changes in tumour aggressiveness and size, being found 
both in tumour tissue and plasma from patients with 
CCA253. Detection of cfDNA in plasma samples could 
also guide potential mutational-based therapeutic interventions as de novo multiple point mutations in FGFR2
kinase domain were detected in cfDNA, primary tumours 
and metastases from patients with CCA with acquired 
resistance to the pan-FGFR inhibitor BGJ398 (ref.
254). 
On the other hand, miRNAs have received special attention due to their increased stability and abundance in 
biofluids. Two meta-analyses have evaluated their diagnostic value for CCA, and found a pooled area under the 
receiver operator curve (AUC) of ~0.9 (refs255,256). Notably, 
bile represented the biological fluid with the highest 
diagnostic capacity, followed by serum, tissue and urine 
(AUC 0.95, 0.913, 0.846 and 0.745, respectively)256. In this 
regard, some bile miRNAs have already been shown to 
display increased diagnostic capacity for CCA, in comparison with healthy individuals (miR-9, miR-145)257 and 
also when comparing patients with PSC-derived CCA 
and isolated PSC (miR-412, miR-640, miR-1537, miR3189)258. Importantly, combining miR-1537 with CA19-9 
resulted in higher diagnostic values than CA19-9 alone 
(AUC 0.91 versus 0.88; P>0.05)258. In serum, the levels of 
miR-21 (refs259–261), a well-known onco-miR, were found 
to be increased in patients with CCA, compared with 
healthy individuals, positively correlating with clinical 
stage and poor survival, although the translation of this 
miRNA into clinics should be performed carefully since 
it is usually increased in serum and/or plasma of patients 
with HCC and other liver diseases and cancers262,263. 
Other miRNAs were also differentially found in the 
serum and/or plasma of patients with CCA compared

with control individuals264–270, but with some inconsistency, which underscores the necessity for conducting 
further studies for validation in large, biopsy-proven 
and well-characterized cohorts of patients and adequate 
controls.
Proteins and cytokines are now regarded as potential 
diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarkers. A soluble fragment of cytokeratin-19 (CYFRA 21-1), MMP-7, osteopontin, periostin and IL-6, among others, were shown 
to be enriched in the serum of patients with CCA, when 
compared with healthy individuals as controls and/or 
patients with benign biliary diseases (such as PSC)271–282. 
Among these biomarkers, increased CYFRA 21-1 and 
osteopontin levels showed superior diagnostic capacity for identifying CCA compared with CA19-9 and 
CEA271,275, and also showed prognostic value. Of note, 
increased serum periostin levels were also associated 
with decreased OS, and the serum periostin level was 
an independent prognostic factor (HR 3.197)282. As cancer cells display marked metabolic alterations, measuring metabolites in distinct biological samples is now 
regarded as an encouraging alternative to find diagnostic 
and/or prognostic biomarkers. Up to now, only a limited 
number of studies have addressed this issue. Bile acids 
and phospholipids have been highlighted as promising 
metabolites in bile for the diagnosis of CCA, as their 
levels are increased in patients with CCA compared 
with healthy individuals and patients with HCC283–287. 
Serum metabolomics has also revealed promising diagnostic biomarkers288,289. An international collaborative 
study including patients with biopsy-proven iCCA, 
HCC or PSC and healthy individuals found that several 
metabolites had higher diagnostic capacity for iCCA 
than CA19-9, and the authors proposed an algorithm 
containing six metabolites that was able to differentially 
diagnose iCCA and HCC (AUC 0.9) in discovery (n=20 
per group) and validation phases (independent cohorts 
of 14–15 patients per group)289. Interestingly, proteomic 
analysis of serum extracellular vesicles from patients 
with CCA, HCC or PSC and healthy individuals as controls revealed candidate proteins with high accuracy for 
the differential diagnosis of these liver diseases, having 
higher AUC values than either CA19-9 or α-fetoprotein 
levels239. Furthermore, another study identified an extracellular vesicle-derived miRNA panel in bile (miRNAs 
miR-191, miR-486-3p, miR-1274b and miR-484) for 
the discrimination of CCA from non-malignant biliary diseases290. Although few studies have addressed 
the potential role of circulating tumour cells (CTCs) as 
diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarkers in CCA, in a 
study investigating the associations between numbers of 
CTCs, patient and tumour characteristics and survival in 
patients with biliary tract cancer, 17–25% of the patients 
showed elevated numbers of CTCs (two or more per 
7.5mL of blood)291–293, and <10% of the patients showed 
five or more CTCs per 7.5mL of blood292. Elevated numbers of CTCs were correlated with greater tumour extent 
and with reduced overall and disease-free survival292,293. 
Nevertheless, novel isolation techniques are warranted 
since the available ones are mainly based on the presence 
of epithelial cell adhesion molecule, which is elevated in 
only ~10–20% of CCAs291.
Specific biomarkers in tumour tissue represent promising tools to predict prognosis and treatment response 
to potential adjuvant therapies in resected CCAs. In two 
large and independent cohorts of patients with iCCA who 
had undergone tumour resection (n=137 in one study56; 
n=292 in the other119), mutations in KRAS (12–16%) and 
TP53 (13–20%) were associated with shorter OS and an 
increased rate of tumour recurrence when compared 
with patients with IDH1 or IDH2 mutations or an 
‘undetermined’ group (with none of the aforementioned mutations)56,119. According to the transcriptomic 
profile of iCCA tumours110, the proliferation type was 
linked with a worse prognosis. Furthermore, a specific 36-gene signature was strongly associated with 
poor survival in patients with resected iCCA8
, and a 
meta-analysis of 73 studies (including 4,126 patients 
with CCA) revealed 77 prognostic protein biomarkers, 
of which fascin, EGFR, mucin 1 (MUC1), MUC4 and 
p27 were independently associated with OS: high levels of EGFR, MUC1, MUC4 and fascin expression were 
associated with reduced survival, whereas a high level of 
p27 expression was associated with increased survival294. 
Increased levels of miR-21 expression in iCCA were also 
positively correlated with clinical stage at diagnosis, 
tumour differentiation status and were linked with poor 
overall and progression-free survival259,295.
Management
Treatment of localized and advanced disease stages
Surgery is a potential curative option for CCA. However, 
most patients (∼70%) are diagnosed at late stages due to 
lack of specific symptoms104. When disease is unresectable, only palliative treatment is possible104,296. Figure 7
summarizes the experience and recommended management of patients diagnosed with CCA according to 
current guidelines, and lists upcoming potential treatments (see also Supplementary Table 1 for a summary 
of relevant clinical trials of drugs for CCA).
Surgery. Most patients with CCA have metastatic 
or locally advanced (that is, unresectable) disease at 
presentation, and only ∼25% are eligible for resection297.
The majority of patients with iCCA present with 
large tumours (median size 6cm)298. In ∼15% of patients 
the tumour grows towards the hepatic hilum causing 
biliary obstruction. A biopsy is not needed to confirm 
the diagnosis in patients with characteristic CCA imaging, elevated serum levels of CA19-9 and normal IgG4 
levels, or after excluding other primary tumours (that is, 
colorectal, gastric and breast). The goal of surgery is a 
complete margin-negative resection (R0) with an adequate future liver remnant. Most patients require an 
(extended) hemi-hepatectomy with lymphadenectomy 
of at least six locoregional lymph nodes for adequate 
staging103. Staging laparoscopy is recommended by clinical guidelines, especially in patients with a high CA19-9 
level or major vascular invasion299.
Regarding pCCA, pre-operative drainage of the 
future liver remnant is performed to improve liver function and avoid post-hepatectomy liver failure300,301. For 
this purpose, imaging (CT and/or MRCP) should be 
performed prior to biliary drainage for accurate staging 
NAture RevIewS | GASTROENTEROLOgy & HEPATOLOgy volume 17 | September 2020 | 573

and surgical planning. Surgery typically involves an 
(extended) hemi-hepatectomy, including the caudate 
lobe with en-bloc resection of the extrahepatic bile duct 
and regional lymph nodes. Staging laparoscopy should 
precede laparotomy to exclude occult metastatic disease 
that occurs in ∼15% of patients302. The 90-day postoperative mortality is up to 10% in experienced centres in 
Europe, with most (~48%) of those who die dying from 
post-hepatectomy liver failure303,304. In the largest centre 
in Asia, overall mortality was 4.7% for the period 1977–
2010, with the rate markedly decreasing from 11.1% 
to 1.4% for the periods 1977–1990 and 2006–2010, 
respectively305. Patients with metastatic pCCA clearly 
do not benefit from resection305. However, patients with 
locally advanced disease undergo resection. The presence of Bismuth type IV pCCA (involving both the right 
and left intrahepatic ducts) is no longer an absolute contraindication for complete resection since it is associated 
with an OS similar to that in patients with less extensive 
biliary extension306. Moreover, resection and reconstruction of the portal vein and hepatic artery are increasingly 
performed307,308. However, tumour abutment on imaging of the main portal vein or common hepatic artery 
exceeding 180° is associated with a poor prognosis297. In 
most patients with extensive vascular involvement, the 
small potential benefit of resection might not justify 
the considerable surgical mortality rate. Future research 
should improve pre-operative assessment of the biliary 
extent of pCCA to reduce the number of R1 resections 
and of the function of the future liver remnant to reduce 
the likelihood of post-hepatectomy liver failure. Surgical 
strategies for dCCA usually require performing a pancreaticoduodenectomy, with removal of the head of the 
pancreas, the first part of the duodenum, the gallbladder 
and the bile duct296.
Patients with distant metastatic disease or involvement 
of aortocaval or truncal nodes are unlikely to benefit 
from resection309. In a 2018 SEER analysis, even patients 
with positive regional lymph nodes had similar OS 
after resection and adjuvant systemic chemotherapy310. 
Most guidelines recommend resection only for solitary tumours28,296,299. In a study investigating long-term 
outcomes after resection of iCCA, the median OS in 
patients with a solitary iCCA was 43.2 months, versus 
21.2 months in those with two tumours and 15.3 months 
in those with three or more tumours311. Patients requiring 
major vascular resection for iCCA increasingly undergo 
resection with an acceptable median OS of 33 months312.
Resectable disease: role of adjuvant therapy. Frequent 
post-surgical relapse313,314 has led to multiple attempts 
to identify patients at increased risk of relapse315,316 and 
also to a number of studies of adjuvant therapy. Three 
phase III randomized clinical studies have been reported, 
and in all of them patients with resected biliary tract 
cancer (CCA and gallbladder cancer) were randomly 
assigned to observation alone or chemotherapy317–319. The 
chemotherapy arm was gemcitabine in the BCAT study

(pCCA or dCCA only)317, gemcitabine and oxaliplatin 
(all biliary tract cancers) in the PRODIGE-12 study318, 
and capecitabine in the BILCAP study (all biliary tract 
cancers)319. A total of 226, 196 and 447 patients were randomly assigned in each study, respectively320. Although 
the BCAT and the PRODIGE-12 study failed to show 
a benefit from gemcitabine-based chemotherapy, the 
BILCAP study showed a benefit from adjuvant capecitabine in the pre-planned sensitivity analysis when compared with observation alone, in terms of OS (HR 0.71); 
however, no statistically significant benefit was observed 
in the intention-to-treat OS analysis. The BILCAP study 
did show a benefit in favour of capecitabine in terms of 
relapse-free survival (HR 0.75). Based on the partial benefits reported in the BILCAP trial, international guidelines 
published in 2019 recommend adjuvant capecitabine for 
a period of 6 months following curative resection of CCA 
as the current standard of care321. The role of chemoradiotherapy remains unclear and might be of benefit in 
patients with pCCA or dCCA with microscopic positive surgical margins (R1)321,322 or other high-risk factors, although this approach needs to be confirmed in 
prospective studies. Ongoing studies are evaluating the 
role of combination chemotherapy such as cisplatin 
and gemcitabine (ACTICCA-1 trial, NCT02170090; 
ClinicalTrials.gov) in the adjuvant setting.
Liver transplantation for intrahepatic and perihilar 
CCA. The inability to obtain a complete resection 
remains a limitation. Liver transplantation for pCCA 
was initially determined to be contraindicated due to a 
high rate of recurrence (~50%)323–325. However, following promising initial single-centre reports, a 
multicentre retrospective study in 216 patients with earlystage, unresectable pCCA treated with neoadjuvant 
chemoradiotherapy followed by liver transplantation 
in 12 centres in the USA demonstrated 5-year diseasefree survival of 65%, with an intent-to-treat 5-year 
survival of 53%326–328. An area of uncertainty is that in 
a subgroup of patients, no malignancy was ever confirmed (either pre-operatively or in explanted specimens)329. Subsequent studies have replicated these 
findings, and identified risk factors for wait-list dropout as well as for disease recurrence, thus identifying 
potential candidates for more effective future systemic 
therapies329–332. Still, in an Irish cohort, short-term mortality (10–58 months) was observed in patients with 
CCA undergoing liver transplantation and receiving 
neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy330.
The efficacy of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and 
liver transplantation in patients with unresectable disease has led to the question of whether similar therapy 
should be offered to patients with resectable pCCA. 
The extremely limited supply of liver allografts and the 
need for life-long immunosuppression are important 
obstacles to this strategy. However, a retrospective 
multicentre study found that patients with unresectable pCCA undergoing combined neoadjuvant therapy 
plus liver transplantation had longer 5-year survival 
(64% versus 18%; P<0.001) than patients undergoing 
resection who otherwise met liver transplantation criteria, and this difference remained statistically significant 
in an intention-to-treat analysis, even after accounting 
for tumour size, nodal status and PSC333.
The data for liver transplantation in the setting of 
iCCA are more preliminary than for pCCA, but might 
be of great value for patients with cirrhosis and tumours 
smaller than 2 cm. In an initial Spanish study, 5-year 
survival following transplantation in patients with 
small, incidental iCCA (<2 cm) was 65%, and this was 
confirmed in a larger international retrospective analysis using similar selection criteria24,334. In a small series 
of patients (n=6) with very large, unresectable iCCA 
treated with liver transplantation after a prolonged 
period of disease stability following treatment with 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the 5-year survival was 83% 
although, importantly, recurrence was noted in 50% of 
the patients335.
Palliative chemotherapy. At the time of assessment of 
patients with CCA for palliative treatment, the following 
three aspects need to be considered: patient fitness as 
assessed in terms of ECOG-PS (patients with an ECOGPS of ≥3 are unlikely to benefit from treatment and 
should be managed with best supportive care); disease 
distribution (patients with oligometastatic disease or with 
liver-only disease might be suitable for specific treatment 
approaches); and accessibility of tumour profiling.
Robust data support the used of first-line cisplatin 
and gemcitabine chemotherapy in patients with advanced disease336,337. The ABC-02 trial randomly assigned 
410 patients with ECOG-PS ≤2 to systemic chemotherapy with gemcitabine alone or cisplatin–gemcitabine336; 
the study showed an OS benefit in favour of cisplatin–
gemcitabine (HR 0.64), a benefit confirmed in the 
Japanese randomized phase II BT22 study337. Although 
patients with bilirubin more than twice the upper limit 
of normal were excluded from the ABC-02 trial, safety 
and feasibility data support its use in patients with a good 
ECOG-PS (PS 0 or 1) with jaundice who have refractory biliary obstruction due to endoluminal disease338. 
More intensive triple-chemotherapy combinations are 
being explored in the first-line setting, such as cisplatin–
gemcitabine combined with nab-paclitaxel339 or with S1 
(tegafur, gimeracil and oteracil)340, and FOLFIRINOX 
(5-FU, oxaliplatin and irinotecan; AMEBICA study, 
NCT02591030). Acelarin (NUC-1031) is a first-in-class 
nucleotide analogue, which, unlike gemcitabine, is independent of hENT2 (also known as SLC29A2) cellular 
transport and is not metabolized by cytidine deaminase, 
resulting in greater intracellular concentrations. Acelarin 
with cisplatin341 will be compared with gemcitabine 
and cisplatin combination therapy in a phase III study 
(NCT04163900).
After progression on first-line chemotherapy, the 
benefit of second-line treatment remained unclear 
until the past few years342. The phase III ABC-06 clinical trial randomly assigned 162 patients diagnosed 
with advanced biliary tract cancer (72% CCA) who had 
already progressed on first-line cisplatin–gemcitabine to 
active symptom control (81 patients) or active symptom 
control with FOLFOX (folinic acid, 5-FU and oxaliplatin) second-line chemotherapy (81 patients), with OS 
as the primary end-point343. The ABC-06 trial showed 
NAture RevIewS | GASTROENTEROLOgy & HEPATOLOgy volume 17 | September 2020 | 575
ConSenSuS S tatement

a benefit from second-line chemotherapy (adjusted HR 
0.69). Although differences in median OS were modest (5.3 versus 6.2 months) between study arms, differences in survival at 6 months (35.5% versus 50.6%) and 
12 months (11.4% versus 25.9%) were clinically meaningful. Based on these findings, FOLFOX can be considered 
a new standard of care in the second-line setting.
Liver-directed therapies and management of oligometastatic disease. The benchmark for liver-directed 
therapies was set by a subgroup analysis of the ABC 
trials including only those 32 patients who received cisplatin and gemcitabine for unresectable iCCA without 
extrahepatic metastasis344. The median OS in cisplatintreated and gemcitabine-treated patients with iCCA 
was 16.7 months and the 3-year OS was 0%. Patients 
diagnosed with iCCA in liver-predominant disease 
might be considered for liver-directed therapies345,346. 
Options for intra-arterial therapy include transarterial 
radioembolization (TARE) with yttrium-90 (ref.
347) and 
liver chemosaturation232. TARE is the most developed 
approach but robust evidence supporting its activity is 
modest347–350, and the randomized SIRCCA clinical trial 
evaluating the benefit of adding TARE to gemcitabine 
and cisplatin in liver-only locally advanced iCCA was 
prematurely interrupted because of poor recruitment 
(NCT02807181). Options for local therapy, in the form 
of external beam radiation351, are also available. Data are 
awaited from prospective studies (such as the ABC-07 
study; EudraCT 2014-003656-31) to evaluate the benefit derived from such approaches in combination 
with systemic chemotherapy. A phase II trial including 38 patients with unresectable iCCA who received 
hepatic intra-arterial pump chemotherapy with floxuridine found an impressive radiological response rate of 
58% and a 3-year OS exceeding 40%352.
Targeted therapies. Inhibitors of IDH1 (AG120, 
IDH305), IDH2 (AG221) and pan-IDH1–IDH2 (AG881) 
are currently being tested in patients with iCCA. AG120 
(ivosidenib) was tested in 73 patients with IDH1-mutant 
advanced CCA in a phase I study353. The only treatmentrelated grade 3 or worse adverse event present in more 
than one patient was fatigue (two patients, 3%), and 
5% had a confirmed partial response. In a preliminary 
phase  III trial in which 185 patients with IDH-1
mutant CCA were randomly assigned to ivosidenib 
or placebo128, ivosidenib showed a benefit in terms of 
progression free-survival (HR 0.37). Median OS was 
10.8 months in patients receiving ivosidenib and 
9.7 months in patients receiving placebo (HR 0.69); after 
adjustment of the OS estimation in the placebo arm for 
crossover (57% of patients in the placebo arm crossed 
over to ivosidenib at time of disease progression), the 
median OS in the placebo arm was 6 months. This landmark study provided level A evidence for the efficacy 
of targeted therapy in CCA and mandates the provision 
of molecular profiling in this cancer.
There have been promising preliminary data 
for FGFR inhibitors from phase II studies123,354–357. 
Hyperphosphataemia has been shown to be a class 
effect due to on-target blockade, and requires monitoring and active management356. Some FGFR inhibitors are currently being evaluated earlier in the 
disease course (first-line setting; for example, the FIGHT302 study (NCT03656536), and the PROOF study 
(NCT03773302)). Furthermore, some pan-tumour 
studies including patients with neurotrophic RTK 
fusions (TRK inhibitors)358,359 or WNT pathway alterations such as RNF43 mutations (porcupine inhibitors; 
NCT03447470)118 are relevant to CCA, but only for a very 
small percentage of patients.
Role of immunotherapy. To date, the clinical data 
on immune-directed therapies in CCA are limited. 
Immunotherapy approaches such as vaccines have been 
tested in CCA without notable success360. Early data are 
also available for CAR T cell immunotherapy361. In some 
patients, immune checkpoint blockade with monoclonal antibodies has shown remarkable and durable 
response rates in a variety of human malignancies362. 
Checkpoint inhibitors were shown to be effective in patients with MMR-deficient tumours (including some 
patients with CCA) achieving objective responses in up 
to 40% of patients363. The KEYNOTE-028 basket trial of 
pembrolizumab included patients with advanced biliary 
tract cancer. The objective response rate in this subset was 
17% (4 of 23) with a median progression-free survival of 
1.8 months364. However, the KEYNOTE-158 trial failed to 
confirm such activity in biliary tract tumours, with only 
6% of patients responding, with a median progressionfree survival of 2 months (NCT02628067) according to a 
preliminary report230. The probable way forward for the 
development of immunotherapy in CCA (in tumours 
without MMR deficiency, which respond better) requires 
either combination immunotherapeutic approaches 
targeting both the innate and adaptive immune system 
and/or combined strategies involving chemotherapy or 
radiation, already planned as part of some of the ongoing 
clinical trials (ABC-09 trial; NCT03260712). Overall, recommendations for CCA management are summarized 
in Box 1.
Mechanisms of chemoresistance
A major limitation in the management of patients with 
CCA is the lack of response to pharmacological treatment.

Box 1 | Recommendations for cholangiocarcinoma management
•	Surgical resection (based on the TNM criteria) is currently a potential curative option 
for cholangiocarcinoma (CCA).
•	Adjuvant chemotherapy with capecitabine for 6 months after surgical resection with 
curative intent is recommended for intrahepatic CCA.
•	Liver transplantation is a potentially curative option for intrahepatic and perihilar 
CCA; promising results in terms of overall survival have been reported and it must be 
considered for patients with cirrhosis and intrahepatic CCA tumours ≤2cm.
•	Combination of cisplatin and gemcitabine is the standard of care for patients with 
unresected tumours, as a palliative treatment.
•	FOLFOX (folinic acid, fluorouracil and oxaliplatin) can be recommended as 
second-line standard of care chemotherapy.
•	Molecular profiling of cancer tumour tissue is highly recommended because it could 
provide access to effective, personalized, treatment options; phase III trials with 
IDH1–IDH2 or FGFR inhibitors as first- and/or second-line treatment are ongoing.

the marked multidrug resistance phenotype of CCA are 
still poorly understood365. Nevertheless, to identify the 
so-called resistome, including a set of proteins involved 
in the lack of response to chemotherapies, is required 
to predict treatment failure and to adapt the therapeutic strategy to the evolving defences of the tumour366. 
Genes involved in MOC are expressed by normal cholangiocytes, with different roles in their physiology, such 
as protection against potentially harmful compounds 
present in bile. Their expression during carcinogenesis 
accounts for intrinsic chemoresistance, whereas upregulation in response to treatment contributes to acquired 
chemoresistance365,367.
On the basis of their mechanism of action, MOC 
genes have been classified into seven groups365,366
(Fig. 8). For instance, impaired expression and/or function of plasma membrane solute carriers involved in 
drug uptake (MOC-1a) results in decreased sensitivity 
to drugs that cannot reach their intracellular targets. 
Downregulation of concentrative nucleoside transporters and equilibrative nucleoside transporters, 
involved in the uptake of nucleoside analogues, such 
as gemcitabine and 5-FU, or the copper transporter 
CTR1, involved in cisplatin uptake, lead to reduced 
sensitivity of CCA cells to these drugs368,369. OCT1 
downregulation in CCA369–371 is involved in the lack of 
response to sorafenib372. ATP-binding cassette pumps 
are important factors accounting for the low intracellular concentrations of anticancer drugs (MOC-1b). 
The multidrug resistance protein 1, able to export 
etoposide, doxorubicin, paclitaxel and vinblastine, has 
been detected in gallbladder epithelium373, whereas the 
multidrug resistance-associated proteins MRP1 and 
MRP3 have been observed in CCA369. MRP1 expression 
has been associated with poor prognosis of patients with 
iCCA374. Changes in metabolic enzymes can reduce the 
proportion of active drugs inside tumour cells (MOC-2). 
Uridine monophosphate synthase, thymidine phosphorylase and uridine phosphorylase 1, which transforms 
5-FU and gemcitabine into their active metabolites, are 
upregulated in many 5-FU-sensitive CCA tumours375. 
Glutathione S-transferase P, which inactivates drugs, 
such as cisplatin, by conjugation with glutathione, is 
highly expressed in CCA376.
Importantly, the response to anticancer agents is 
dependent on the expression and/or function of their 
molecular targets (MOC-3). High expression of thymidylate synthase in human biliary tract carcinoma cells 
has been related to insensitivity to 5-FU377. Studies in 
CCA cells expressing oestrogen receptors have suggested that selective agonists could be a therapeutic 
option in patients with CCA378. Expression levels of 
EGFR have been associated with the sensitivity of CCA 
cells to targeted agents379. Moreover, increased ability 
of tumour cells to repair drug-induced DNA damage 
(MOC-4) can also contribute to chemoresistance. The 
endonuclease DNA excision repair protein 1 removes 
bulky DNA adducts, whose levels have been associated 
with the response to cisplatin in patients with CCA380.

involved in DNA MMR, such as human MLH1, affect 
prognosis in CCA381. Upregulation of ribonucleotide 
reductase p53R2 has been proposed as a predictive 
marker of CCA resistance to gemcitabine382. Decreased 
expression and/or function of pro-apoptotic proteins 
results in reduced efficacy of chemotherapy (MOC-5a). 
Downregulation of NK4 in response to 5-FU treatment 
induces resistance in CCA cells to this drug in vitro55. 
Downregulation of BAX, BAK, caspase 3 and caspase 9 
has been associated with drug resistance in cancer383. 
Interaction of Fas cell surface death receptor with 
calmodulin inhibits Fas-induced apoptosis and results 
in CCA chemoresistance384. By contrast, enhanced 
expression and/or function of anti-apoptotic proteins 
also reduces the efficacy of chemotherapy (MOC-5b). 
Overexpression of ERK and BCL-2 or the overactivation 
of the PI3K–AKT and RAF–MEK–ERK pathways have 
been associated with chemoresistance in CCA cells385. 
CCA usually shows lower vascularity than in HCC — 
probably as a result of its extensive stroma — which is 
associated with greater malignant potential386. Moreover, 
this reduced vascularity due to extensive stroma can 
limit the access of administered drugs to all tumour 
cells (MOC-7). This feature and other characteristics 
that affect the TME, including hypoxia and reduced 
pH, could reduce the effectiveness of anticancer drugs 
(MOC-6)387. It has been proposed that ECM proteins, 
such as laminin-332, induce resistance to doxorubicin 
and sorafenib in CCA197. Finally, activation of EMT is 
also involved in resistance to chemotherapy (MOC-7)366. 
High mobility group A1 protein promoted CCA tumorigenicity and conferred resistance to gemcitabine in vitro 
in CCA cell lines388.
Future directions and recommendations
The known risk factors for CCA are only involved in 
∼20% of cases, indicating the urgent need to ascertain 
other causes of disease to improve awareness and screening policies for early diagnosis, which might substantially influence patient outcomes. However, considering 
some established risk factors, potential prevention strategies and lifestyle-modifying concerted actions should 
be developed to increase awareness. For instance, HBV 
vaccination, improvements in treatment of HBV infection, HCV infection and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, 
and promotion of specific campaigns aiming to reduce 
alcohol and tobacco consumption, as well as obesity, 
might markedly influence both the incidence and 
mortality of CCA.
The accurate recording of epidemiological data (incidence and mortality of each subtype of CCA) and the 
elucidation of the environmental risk factors and their 
interplay with genetic and molecular determinants in 
cholangiocarcinogenesis are extremely important. In this 
regard, a new coding system was recently approved 
(ICD-11 and ICD-O-4)20 that better reflects the CCA 
subtypes — intrahepatic, perihilar and extrahepatic 
(distal) CCAs — and will start to be used in 2021. 
Importantly, diagnostic data need to be recorded uniformly and accurately by clinicians, administrators and 
cancer registries. Awareness of the historical miscoding 
of CCA should be raised amongst all members of the 
multidisciplinary team, and at all levels. We need to 
ensure the appropriate education of coding personnel, 
who should have senior clinician input to check the 
accuracy of coding data. Furthermore, accuracy of coding data should be regularly audited. In the future, given 
advances in our understanding of the genetic drivers for 
subtypes of CCA, perhaps coding of CCA might also 
involve molecular profiling.
CCAs are highly heterogeneous at both the intertumoural and intratumoural levels, and have a very poor 
prognosis. The high heterogeneity and chemoresistance 
of CCAs represent a limitation for common therapeutic 
strategies, but it is a unique opportunity for personalized, targeted therapies. Up to 50% of CCAs have current druggable mutations, amplifications or fusions (for 
example, IDH1, IDH2, BRAF, FGFR, HER2, PIK3CA, 
MET, among others), opening a new opportunity for 
therapeutic intervention that deserves intense basic 
and clinical research. In fact, targeting these mutations 
is amenable and is already a reality in other types of 
cancer389,390. In this scenario, the treatment of patients 
with breast cancer or colorectal cancer with trastuzumab (anti-HER2)391 and cetuximab–panitumumab 
(anti-EGFR)392 is an example of the successful use of 
targeted therapy. Therefore, exploration of targeted therapies on a background of standard of care chemotherapy 
should be continued for CCA. In addition, combined 
efforts should be made to develop curative therapies. 
Cost is a major drawback and funding opportunities should be revisited and improved, in parallel with 
increased awareness amongst the research community, 
general society, funding agencies and the pharmaceutical 
industry. Concerted action aimed at increasing the cooperation of these entities should be realized to achieve 
new effective therapies.
Interactions between cancer cells, CSCs and the 
TME, as well as the evident clonal evolution and cellular aberrations (genomic, genetic, epigenetic and molecular) contribute to CCA heterogeneity. New technical 
approaches such as single-cell RNA or DNA sequencing 
could provide novel critical information about cellular 
heterogeneity, in both the tumour compartment and the 
stroma, by capturing genomic and/or genetic alteration 
with a resolution at the level of the single cell.
New classifications of CCAs based on the combination of clinical, radiological, histological, genomic and 
molecular features, and later evaluation of their associations with prognosis and treatment response, are 
mandatory. In addition, it is fundamental to include 
the resistome in this equation, since the baseline and 
acquired MOCs will undoubtedly contribute to the success of the therapies tested. The potential determination 
of the resistome in liquid biopsies (that is, in cfDNA) 
would open a new avenue for personalized treatment. 
Future clinical trials should consider the stratification of 
patients considering clinicopathological subtyping and 
risk factors, as well as the genomic landscape. Moreover, 
patient selection for surgery, local therapies, chemotherapy and targeted therapies must be improved. Similar to 
the tumour compartment, a better stratification of these 
alterations within the microenvironment could help in 
the design of innovative treatment options including

immunotherapies (such as immune checkpoints and 
CAR T cell therapy) and ECM-oriented treatments. 
The majority of clinical trials performed so far for 
advanced CCA did not take all these considerations 
into account, which might explain, at least in part, the 
disappointing results obtained. Thus, action needs to be 
taken to bring together experts across different fields. 
In addition, robust circulating biomarkers are needed 
for the accurate diagnosis of CCA, as well as to predict 
prognosis and treatment response. Non-coding RNA, 
specifically miRNAs, long non-coding RNAs and circular RNAs393,394 and circulating proteins and/or metabolites could represent such promising biomarkers, due 
to their easy detection and stability in biological fluids, 
either free or encapsulated into extracellular vesicles. 
In this regard, international collaborative projects, such 
as the ESCALON project (competitively funded by 
the European Union as part of the Horizon 2020 programme), are warranted to improve the understanding, 
prediction (risk factors) and diagnosis (biomarkers) of 
CCA not only in Europe and North America, but also in 
Latin America and other continents.
CCA management nowadays requires dedicated 
centres with multidisciplinary expertise that enable the 
proper translation of basic investigations to clinical practice. International collaborative networks of multidisciplinary scientists such as the ENS-CCA are especially 
important as they are accelerating acquisition of scientific knowledge on this cancer, which then influences 
clinical practice. In particular, it is important to highlight the ENS-CCA Action EURO-CHOLANGIO-NET, 
a European Horizon 2020 competitive programme 
(2019–2023) that has the objective to create and boost 
multidisciplinary and cross-sectional studies to decipher the biological jigsaw of CCA. This open, structured initiative has received the support of the European 
Commission and is endorsed by the European Association for the Study of the Liver, the International Liver 
Foundation, several research and development companies, and the CCA patient associations (including 
the Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation in the USA and the 
Alan Morement Memorial Fund (AMMF) in the UK). 
During the coming years, EURO-CHOLANGIO-NET 
will concentrate in the following objectives: shorten 
the current gaps in CCA knowledge and applications 
by overcoming the limitation of the small number of 
cases through the development of international clinical, 
histological and radiological registries, which are necessary to dissect the multilevel heterogeneity of CCAs; 
improve translation by generating consensus on appropriate experimental models of CCA, diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarkers and imaging techniques, and clinical 
management; dissect intertumoural and intratumoural 
heterogeneity to define specific features for early diagnosis 
of each CCA subtype; rationalize cost-efficient, personalized, targeted therapies for CCA by defining the driver 
mutations, epigenetic alterations, and transcriptome of 
each CCA histomorphological subtype; and develop 
novel drugs and therapeutic strategies. The ENS-CCA, 
together with dedicated foundations such as the AMMF 
and the Cholangiocarcinoma Foundation, as well as other 
international networks and collaborators have contributed to the creation of the Global Cholangiocarcinoma 
Alliance, which has the aim of joining forces to increase 
awareness of this cancer and to establish a global voice 
in CCA through community collaborations. In Asia, 
an important consortium was created — the Thailand 
Initiative in Genomics and Expression Research for 
Liver Cancer (TIGER-LC) — to identify genomic and 
endemic factors that could modify CCA and HCC susceptibility and progression395. Combining the efforts from 
experts worldwide will definitely contribute to improved 
understanding of CCA and will reinforce the necessary 
link between basic and clinical science, and therefore 
hopefully improve patient welfare.
Conclusions
CCAs are highly aggressive and heterogeneous, at both 
the intertumoural and intratumoural levels, resulting 
in poor prognosis. Different risk factors, interactions 
between cancer cells, CSCs and the TME, as well as 
the evident clonal evolution and genetic and/or epigenetic aberrations contribute to CCA heterogeneity. Different CCA molecular subtypes, with distinct 
prognoses and responses to therapy, have already been 
described. Tumour resection is still the only potentially

percentage of patients are eligible and the percentage 
recurrence is high. We still lack of accurate noninvasive 
biomarkers for the diagnosis and to estimate the prognosis in patients with CCA. Furthermore, knowledge of 
the MOCs of these cancers needs to be expanded, but 
current information should be included in the future 
treatment decisions. Although important information 
has already been unveiled, CCA is still an open field 
of research, with important gaps that need to be filled 
(Table 4). Therefore, all the efforts must be gathered to 
try to go beyond and decipher the complexity of CCA.
