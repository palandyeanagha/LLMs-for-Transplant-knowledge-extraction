Abstract
Background
Depression is prevalent in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) patients. Our aims were to
examine the effects of depression and antidepressants on hepatic outcomes of PBC
patients.
Methods
We used the UK Health Improvement Network database to identify PBC patients between
1974 and 2007. Our primary outcome was one of three clinical events: decompensated cirrhosis, liver transplantation and death. We assessed depression and each class of antidepressant medication in adjusted multivariate Cox proportional hazards models to identify
independent predictors of outcomes. In a sensitivity analysis, the study population was
restricted to PBC patients using ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA).
Results
We identified 1,177 PBC patients during our study period. In our cohort, 86 patients (7.3%)
had a depression diagnosis prior to PBC diagnosis, while 79 patients (6.7%) had a depression diagnosis after PBC diagnosis. Ten-year incidence of mortality, decompensated cirrhosis, and liver transplantation were 13.4%, 6.6%, and 2.0%, respectively. In our adjusted
models, depression status was not a predictor of poor outcomes. After studying all classes
of antidepressants, using the atypical antidepressant mirtazapine after PBC diagnosis was
significantly protective (Adjusted HR 0.23: 95% CI 0.07–0.72) against poor liver outcomes
(decompensation, liver transplant, mortality), which remained statistically significant in
patients using UCDA (HR 0.21: 95% CI 0.05–0.83).

Conclusions
In our study, depression was not associated with poor clinical outcomes. However, using
the antidepressant mirtazapine was associated with decreased mortality, decompensated
cirrhosis and liver transplantation in PBC patients. These findings support further assessment of mirtazapine as a potential treatment for PBC patients.
Introduction
Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an autoimmune disease characterized by immune-mediated destruction of small hepatic bile ducts[1]. The bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has
been the only available therapy for PBC for over two decades. Unfortunately, 30% to 40% of
patients with PBC do not fully respond to UDCA and are at risk of progressing to cirrhosis,
liver failure, and death[2].
PBC is commonly associated with significant systemic symptoms[1, 3]. The prevalence of
depressive symptoms, such as depressed mood, impaired cognition, social withdrawal and loss
of interest among PBC patients, is very high (30–45%)[4–7]. Interestingly, significantly fewer of
these patients are typically assigned a formal depression diagnosis based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV (DSM-IV) criteria[4]. In the context of clinical trials, depression is often measured with standardized self-reported questionnaires. However, significant overlap can exist in
many of these questionnaires between disease-related symptoms (eg. fatigue, loss of interest)
and neurovegatative symptoms of depression[4–6]. This overlap in turn can lead to the reporting of a higher frequency of depressive symptoms amongst patient groups compared to a lower
frequency of patients with formal diagnoses of depression. Similar observations have been
made in PBC[4]. Importantly, antidepressant usage is common among PBC patients due to the
high prevalence of both depression and depressive symptoms [8].Over the last decade, depression has been recognised as a risk factor for poor outcomes in various autoimmune and chronic
inflammatory conditions[9–14]. Remarkably, depression was also identified as a risk factor for
developing autoimmune diseases in a large population based study[15]. Moreover, depression
was associated with increased mortality and poor clinical outcomes in decompensated cirrhosis
patients [16, 17].
Antidepressants can impact immunity and modulate inflammatory responses[18–20]. In
addition, recent animal model studies have shown that serotonin can regulate hepatic immunity and decrease tissue damage [21–23]. While antidepressant usage in liver transplant
patients decreased rates of cellular rejection, the clinical impact of antidepressant usage on a
variety of liver conditions has not been established [24].
The effect of depression, or antidepressants, on disease outcomes in PBC patients is
unknown. Therefore, we used data extracted from a large clinical database to examine the
effect of depression and antidepressant medication treatment on hepatic outcomes of PBC
patients, including hepatic decompensation, transplantation, and death.

THIN have demographic and mortality distributions comparable to the general UK population[26, 27]. Data from participant general practitioners across the UK is exported to the
THIN administrators and database, which is updated every 3 months[28]. The THIN database
records demographic data and clinical events using Read codes, prescription medications, and
laboratory values[29]. The validity of the THIN database coding system (Read Codes) has been
assessed in previous studies [30–33].
Study population and outcomes
We identified patients >18 years with PBC Read code “J6160” from April 1974 until May
2007. This cohort was followed until May 1, 2012. Patients with overlap syndromes with autoimmune hepatitis or primary sclerosing cholangitis were excluded. The first code of PBC identified in the THIN database was considered the index (i.e. diagnosis) date. Fig 1 provides a
flow diagram illustrating the study population selection. The primary outcome was first occurrence of one of three events following the diagnosis of PBC: (1) decompensation of cirrhosis
(ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, variceal bleeding, jaundice, or hepatocellular carcinoma) which were all defined by using Read
codes; (2) liver transplantation; or (3) death. Patients who did not develop an outcome during
the follow-up period were censored on May 1, 2012. All accessed data were fully anonymized.
Exposure variables of interest
Read codes were used to identify patients diagnosed with depression (i.e., at least one code for
a depressive disorder). Read codes associated with only symptoms of depression, bipolar disorder, mania or hypomania were excluded[34]. Depression was coded as follows: (1) never

diagnosed with depression; (2) past depression diagnosis prior to 90 days from PBC diagnosis;
and (3) current depression diagnosis if a diagnosis was made within 90 days before or after a
PBC diagnosis. Using THIN database therapy files, we assessed the impact of antidepressant
medications on PBC patient outcomes (mortality, decompensation, and liver transplant).
For each antidepressant medication use was defined as follows: (1) never used the medication; (2) past use defined as a previous code for medication use prior to 90 days of PBC
diagnosis; and (3) current medication user if the medication code was identified within 90
days before or after a PBC diagnosis. We assessed the effect of each of the following typical
and atypical antidepressant medications on study outcomes separately, as follows: Atypical
antidepressants included agomelatine, mirtazapine and bupropion; Typical antidepressants
included the following groups: (a) Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRI): citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine and sertraline; (b) Selective-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRI): desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, milnacipran and
venlafaxine; (c) serotonin modulators: nefazodone, trazodone and vilazodone; (d) tricyclics
and tetracyclics: amitriptyline, amoxapine, clomipramine, desipramine, doxepin, imipramine, maprotiline, nortriptyline and protriptyline, trimipramine; (e) monamine oxidase
inhibitors: isocarboxazid, phenelzine, selegiline and tranylcypromine.
Study covariates
We assessed age at PBC diagnosis, sex, and the presence of coexisting liver disease (defined as
having chronic liver disease; either viral, alcoholic, or fatty liver disease; yes/no). Smoking status was classified (current, former, never smoked, or unknown status), and alcohol consumption was classified (current, former, never consumed alcohol, or unknown status), both at the
time of PBC diagnosis. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) usage (ever/never recorded) was also
determined.
Data analysis
In our primary analysis we assessed demographic, clinical, and medication variables in the
PBC cohort according to depression status. Where appropriate, we used the Fisher Exact test
or Chi-Square test for categorical data, and the Kruskal-Wallis or Student’s t-test for continuous data. Univariate analysis using Log Rank test and multivariate Cox Proportional Hazards
models were used to assess the impact of depression or antidepressant medications on PBC
outcomes as defined by death, decompensated cirrhosis, or liver transplant. Each outcome was
studied separately in sensitivity analyses. In all models, we adjusted for age, sex, UDCA usage,
and depression status. We assessed for interaction between depression status and antidepressant usage, if both were included in the same model. Estimates were reported as hazard ratios
(HR) and accompanying 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The proportional hazard model
assumption was tested and not violated in any models.
Sensitivity analysis
To assess the validity of our findings, we restricted the study population to PBC patients only
using UDCA. Different survival analyses were performed to identify survival predictors in
each of our study outcomes separately (cirrhosis decompensation, liver transplant, mortality).
All analyses were performed using Stata 14.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) using alpha of
0.05. Both the Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board at the University of Calgary and The Scientific Review Committee of THIN approved the study protocol (ID:16THIN031).

Results
Cohort characteristics
1,177 PBC patients were identified from April 1974 to May 2007. In this cohort, 86 patients
(7.3%) were diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) prior to the diagnosis of PBC,
while 79 patients (6.7%) had a depression diagnosis after their PBC diagnosis. Demographic
and clinical characteristics of PBC patients according to depression status are shown in Table 1.
PBC patients with prior or current depression were younger than those without depression
(median age 59 and 58 versus 63 years, P = 0.009), and were more commonly female (93% and
96% versus 87%, P = 0.02). Prevalence of coexisting liver disease was similar among the three
groups (P = 0.19), Table 1.
Clinical outcomes
Approximately 70% of PBC patients were prescribed UDCA, which did not differ by depression status (see Table 1). The cumulative incidence of mortality at 3, 5, and 10 years was 6.5%,
13.4%, and 25.4%, respectively. The cumulative incidence of decompensated cirrhosis and
liver transplant at 3, 5, and 10 years were 4.1%, 6.6%, 13.0% and 0.1%, 2.0%, 4.0%, respectively.
During a median follow-up of 92 months (range: 58–143 months), overall decompensated cirrhosis, liver transplant, and mortality rates were similar amongst our study groups (overall
mortality: 27.1% for non-depression cohort, 19.8% for previously diagnosed with depression,
and 26.6% for currently depressed patients, P = 0.34).
Antidepressant medication usage
Usage of anti-depressant medications was variable amongst our study groups (see Table 1).
Interestingly, among PBC patients without a diagnosis of depression, 24.6% were using antidepressants after their PBC diagnosis, while 11.1% used antidepressants prior to their PBC diagnosis. Mirtazapine was prescribed at a lower rate for patients with no history of depression (2.7%)
or with a previous depression diagnosis (3.5%), compared to those with a current depression
diagnosis (6.3%), P<0.001. Details on anti-depressant usage are shown in Table 1.
Impact of depression and antidepressants on PBC patient survival
PBC patients with depression were less likely to die, compared to PBC patients without depression (HR 0.52: 95% CI 0.31–0.87). To examine this association further and to assess the role of
antidepressants on this protective effect, we used adjusted models for age, gender, UDCA
usage, alcohol intake, depression status, and assessing for each of the aforementioned antidepressant classes and drugs separately. Mirtazapine was the only antidepressant independently associated with a decreased risk of decompensated cirrhosis, transplantation, or death
(Table 2). In our adjusted models, using mirtazapine after PBC diagnosis was significantly protective (Adjusted HR 0.23: 95% CI 0.07–0.72) against poor outcomes (decompensation, liver
transplant, mortality). Interestingly, current depression status was not a significant predictor
of poor outcomes (Adjusted HR 0.65: 0.38–1.12). There was no interaction between depression
status and mirtazapine usage in our models. See Table 2 and Fig 2.
Sensitivity analysis
First, we limited our cohort to only patients who were using UDCA (n = 793, 67.4%). In
adjusted Cox Regression models, current usage of mirtazapine was protective against decompensated cirrhosis, liver transplant, and mortality (Adjusted HR 0.21: 95% CI 0.05–0.83). We
assessed mirtazapine as an independent predictor for each of our outcomes separately

(cirrhosis decompensation, liver transplant, and mortality). Current usage of mirtazapine was
a significant predictor of decreased mortality (adjusted HR 0.22: 95% CI 0.05–0.89), but not
significantly protective for liver decompensation (adjusted HR 0.22: 95% CI 0.03–1.60). None
of the PBC patients who had ever used mirtazapine required liver transplant in our cohort.
Discussion
This is the first study to describe the effect of depression and antidepressant usage on clinical outcomes of PBC patients. The current mainstay of medical treatment for PBC is UDCA[1]. However, 30–40% of PBC patients fail to respond to UDCA treatment[1, 2] and are at risk for disease
progression to cirrhosis, liver failure, transplantation or death[2]. We used a large clinical database to study the effect of depression and antidepressants usage in a cohort of 1,177 PBC patients.
In our cohort of PBC patients, 14% had been diagnosed with depression (with ~7% having
a depression diagnosis after their PBC diagnosis). The depression rate in our PBC cohort is
consistent with previously reported rates of depression amongst PBC patients. In Al-harthy
et al, the prevalence of depression among PBC patients was 12%[8], while Os et al reported a
lower rate of 4% (95%CI 0–15%). Although the latter study included a small number of
patients (PBC patients n = 55), it was the only study to validate the prevalence of depression
among PBC patients with depressive symptoms (38%) according to DSM-IV criteria[4].
Depressive symptoms are common amongst PBC patients, likely due to the overlap of depression and disease-related symptoms such as fatigue within this population[3, 5]. In fact, fatigue
has been reported in up to 80% of PBC patients [5–7]. Although depression is more prevalent
in PBC than in the general population[35], no detailed study evaluated the impact of depression on PBC natural history. As for antidepressant usage, only one study assessed the effect of
the antidepressant fluvoxamine on fatigue in PBC patients[36]. Nonetheless, no study has evaluated the effect of antidepressants on PBC clinical outcomes.
Amongst our PBC cohort, patients who suffered from previous or current depression were
younger than patients with no history of depression (median age 59, 58 vs. 63). This finding is
consistent with previous studies[4, 5]. Although the difference between groups was not clinically
significant, one possible explanation is that younger patients are more likely to seek medical
care and are subjected to a diagnosis bias. Moreover, PBC patients complaining of fatigue
appear to be younger than older PBC patients[8]. Therefore, younger PBC patients are more
likely to be exposed to further medical evaluation and subsequently diagnosed with depression.
In our patient cohort, the risk of death 10 years following PBC diagnosis was 25%. This
high risk of death is consistent with previously published cohorts of PBC patients[1, 2, 37] and
was associated with the occurrence of decompensated cirrhosis and transplantation. We
explored the potential therapeutic effect of antidepressants on PBC prognosis following our

observation that PBC patients with depression were less likely to die, compared to PBC
patients without depression. Interestingly, after adjusting for antidepressant usage, the effect of
depression on adverse liver outcomes was no longer observed. However, we found that use of
the antidepressant mirtazapine had a significant protective effect against poor outcomes in our
PBC patient cohort. Specifically, mirtazapine was responsible for a striking greater than fourfold protective effect against liver decompensation, transplantation, or death, which was robust
following adjustment for potential confounders including age, sex, and alcohol use. The effect
of mirtazapine was independent of UDCA use, as the association was consistent following
adjustment for UDCA use in the Cox proportional hazard model. Moreover, our sensitivity
analysis, that restricted the study population to patients with PBC taking UDCA, showed that
mirtazapine’s protective effect was consistent in this cohort. Such a protective effect was not
observed with any other antidepressant. While Fluoxetine had a protective effect in univariate
analysis, this effect was not observed in our adjusted models.
Although mirtazapine was originally approved for the clinical treatment of depression, its’
unique pharmacological profile has facilitated widespread clinical use to treat numerous other
clinical disorders, including sleep disturbance, addiction, and anxiety[38, 39]. Consistent with
this, the majority of PBC patients in our cohort who were prescribed mirtazapine did not have
a coexisting diagnosis of depression.
Mirtazapine exhibits a complex pharmacology, having both central and peripheral effects
[38]. It can act as a 5HT2A and 5HT2B serotonin receptor antagonist, a 5HT2C serotonin
receptor inverse agonist, and an antagonist for 5HT3 and histamine (H1) receptors[38].

Therefore, given its’ complex pharmacology, mirtazapine could plausibly improve hepatic outcomes in PBC patients through a number of potential mechanisms involving serotonin receptor modulation or inhibition of histamine effects. In a number of animal models serotonin has
been shown to regulate hepatic immunity, altering inflammatory responses and associated tissue damage that ultimately leads to progressive liver fibrosis[21–23]. Serotonin has been linked
to the regulation of hepatocyte proliferation during liver regeneration via activation of 5HT2
receptors[40], and to enhanced tissue repair in hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury[41]. It also
has been involved in inhibiting cholangiocyte proliferation and cholestasis via 5HT1A receptor
activation[42], and shifting tissue macrophages towards a more anti-inflammatory phenotype
[43]. In contrast, serotonin worsens experimental viral hepatitis[44] and contributes to disease
progression in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease[41]. Importantly, platelets represent a rich
source of serotonin and platelets significantly accumulate in the liver of PBC patients[45].
Therefore, mirtazapine modulation of serotonergic signaling in the liver of PBC patients could
significantly alter hepatic immunity, which in turn could improve clinical outcomes, as
observed in our patient cohort.
The protective effect of mirtazapine in PBC patients was supported by the large patient sample
size and magnitude of the risk estimate. However, several limitations should be considered. We
used a clinical database based on general practitioners’ electronic medical records, which raises
the potential for misclassification error of codes used to define the study population and outcomes. Misclassification errors were evaluated with sensitivity analyses that mandated multiple
codes to define PBC[46], and a sensitivity analysis that restricted the population to those with a
code for PBC and a prescription for UDCA. In our study, we could not evaluate the biochemical
response to UDCA as this data is not included in THIN. To minimize the effect of this limitation,
we performed a sensitivity analysis limiting our cohort to patients who were treated with UDCA.
We feel that our findings support future prospective studies evaluating the impact of mirtazapine
in PBC patients according to UDCA biochemical response. In addition, an epidemiological association cannot prove causality or explain the biological mechanism of mirtazapine’s effect in
PBC. Therefore, future studies should explore potential mechanisms underlying this beneficial
impact of mirtazapine in PBC patients.
In conclusion, we have described the effect of depression and antidepressant usage in a
large PBC patient cohort. We identified that use of the atypical antidepressant mirtazapine was
associated with decreased mortality, reduced need for liver transplantation, and lower rates of
decompensated cirrhosis amongst our PBC patients. This protective association of mirtazapine
was independent of the role of depression, prescription of other antidepressants, or the use of
UDCA. We suggest that these findings support the examination of mirtazapine as a potential
novel therapy for PBC patients.
