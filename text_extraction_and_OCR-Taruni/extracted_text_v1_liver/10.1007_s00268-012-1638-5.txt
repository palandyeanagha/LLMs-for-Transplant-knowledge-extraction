Abstract
Background Radical resection remains the only curative
treatment for hilar cholangiocarcinoma (HCCA). Only a
limited proportion of patients, however, are eligible for
resection. The survival and prognostic factors of these
patients are largely unknown. The aim of this study was to
evaluate survival and prognostic factors in unresectable
patients presenting with HCCA.
Methods We performed a cohort study of the denominator of HCCA patients seen in a tertiary referral center
between March 2003 and March 2009. Demographics,
treatment, pathology results, and survival were analyzed.
Results A total of 217 patients with suspected HCCA
were identified. Ninety-five patients (40 %) underwent
laparotomy, and in 57 (63 %) of these patients resection
was performed. Overall median and 5-year survival of
resected patients were 37 months and 43 %, respectively,
as compared to 13 months and 7 % in unresectable
patients. In unresectable patients, median survival was
better in patients with locally advanced disease
(16 months) as compared to patients with hepatic and
extrahepatic metastases (5 and 3 months, p\0.001). Of
the 160 unresectable patients, 17 (10 %) survived longer
than 3 years.
Conclusion Of the patients presenting with HCCA in our
center, 26 % proved resectable. The 7 % long-term survival rate of unresectable patients is remarkable and
emphasizes the indolent growth of some of these tumors.
Patients with metastases had a much worse prognosis with
a median of 4 months.
Introduction
Survival data regarding resected hilar cholangiocarcinoma
(HCCA) are well described, with 5-year survival rates
varying from 20 to 40 % in most series in recent literature
[1, 2]. Many clinical, surgical, and pathological factors
have been shown to impact long-term outcome, including
negative histological margin status, concomitant hepatic
resection, nodal status, well-differentiated tumor grade,
papillary tumor morphology, and lack of perineural invasion [2, 3]. However, these studies included only those
patients who had undergone resection so, consequently,
these study populations are highly selected.
Much less is known about the survival and prognostic
factors of unresectable patients, and although survival is
mentioned in some papers [4–8], no prognostic factors for
unresectable patients have been reported. Indeed, most
patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma are found unresectable at either presentation, after diagnostic laparoscopy, or
during exploration [9]. Criteria for unresectable disease
include locally advanced tumor, distant metastases, and
lymph node metastases beyond the hepatoduodenal ligament. In addition, patients must be in an acceptable condition to undergo major surgery (encompassing extended
hemihepatectomy in most cases). Locally advanced disease

is based on the extent of proximal infiltration into the biliary ductal tree, the portal venous system, and the hepatic
artery or its branches. Therefore, unresectability of patients
with HCCA can result from local (including vascular) and
nodal status, as well as the presence of distant metastases
and comorbidity of the patient. Although ill-defined, these
different causes of unresectability are likely to influence
survival. The aim of this study was to evaluate overall
survival in a group of patients with unresectable HCCA
and to define prognostic factors in these patients.
Materials and Methods
Patients and staging
All consecutive patients suspected of HCCA who presented
in the AMC over a 7-year period (from March 2003 to March
2009) were evaluated. Only patients with a tumor arising
from the biliary confluence or the right or left main hepatic
ducts were included. Patients with tumors originating in the
proximal common hepatic duct were included if the tumor
extended into the biliary confluence (Bismuth–Corlette
classification II–IV). Cross-sectional imaging studies such
as CT and MRI were used in addition to ultrasound with
Duplex to assess liver parenchymal invasion, vascular
invasion in the portal venous system and/or hepatic arteries,
and hepatic metastases, lymph node metastases, and extrahepatic metastases, as previously described [10].
After imaging studies were concluded, resectability was
discussed in a hepatobiliary multidisciplinary meeting.
Patients considered to have potentially resectable tumors
underwent further evaluation with a staging laparoscopy,
and in the last 2 years of this study, with an additional PETCT [11]. Staging laparoscopy was routinely performed in
resectable patients when feasible, although staging laparoscopy was omitted in some patients with limited BC type I or
II tumors, as we recently described in more detail [12].
Furthermore, 99mTc-mebrofenin scintigraphy [13] was performed in conjunction with CT volumetry to determine the
function of the future remnant liver [13]. Portal vein embolization was performed when the future remnant liver function or volume ([35–40 %) was deemed insufficient [14].
When no distant metastases were found during further
evaluation, patients were planned for resection, and preoperative biliary drainage was performed on at least the future
remnant liver, either percutaneously or endoscopically [15].
Treatment
During laparotomy, the abdomen was inspected for peritoneal
seeding or liver metastases, and for lymph node involvement
outside the liver hilum, in the hepatoduodenal ligament, and
along the common hepatic artery until the celiac axis. In
patients deemed to be resectable, a radical resection was
undertaken encompassing excision of the liver hilum en bloc
with (extended) hemihepatectomy, including the caudate
lobe, and complete lymphadenectomy of the hepatoduodenal
ligament [2, 10, 16]. The portal vein bifurcation was excised
and reconstructed when involved by tumor.
In case of unresectability, only a cholecystectomy was
performed. In some selected cases diagnosed as Bismuth type
I or II tumors with incurability due to locally advanced disease, a palliative (R1-2) local hilar resection was performed
with biliary-enteric anastomoses. These patients with incurable disease were scored as unresectable. In patients with
unresectable disease, biliary drainage was accomplished by
definitive internal stenting by either PTC or ERCP using metal
expandable stents, usually within the same hospital admission.
Adjuvant therapy was not administered after resection in the
patients of this study period. The use of palliative therapy was
not protocol driven and was administered at the discretion of
the surgeons and medical oncologists. Recently, palliative
treatment consisting of gemcitabine plus cisplatin is routinely
advised for unresectable HCCA patients in view of the
encouraging results of the ABC-02-trial [17].
Brush cytology obtained during ERCP has low sensitivity and often does not result in a definitive tissue diagnosis; thus, pathological proof of malignancy is hard to
obtain in all HCCA patients [18, 19]. As a result, and since
pathological proof was not essential in patients undergoing
palliative stenting only, cytological or histological proof
was not available in all patients (Table 1).
Scoring
The reason for unresectability was scored at the moment of the
final assessment (during the hepatobiliary meeting, after staging laparoscopy, or during exploration). Thus, when a patient
was considered unresectable following imaging based on
locally advanced disease, the patient was scored as locally
advanced, even when liver metastases appeared later in the
course of the disease. Likewise, a patient who was diagnosed
with peritoneal metastases during exploration was scored as
extrahepatic metastases. If more causes of unresectability were
found, the cause of unresectability was scored in the following
decreasing order: liver metastases, extrahepatic metastases,
positive lymph nodes, locally advanced disease. Patients who
refused resection or were not in a condition to undergo major
surgery were not included in the survival analysis.
Almost all patients initially underwent biliary drainage
procedures using plastic stents inserted by either ERCP or
PTC. After confirmation of unresectable disease, plastic
stents were generally replaced by metal stents. When
patients received a metal stent after initial plastic stenting,
this was scored as metal stent.

Survival
Survival data were obtained from our database or that of
local hospitals and, if necessary, updated by contacting the
primary-care physicians. Furthermore, additional survival
data were collected through contacting registry databases.
Survival (in months) was measured from the date of initial
presentation at our center to the date of death or the date of
last contact when alive.
Statistical analysis
The data were analyzed using SPSS ver. 16.0 software
(SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Overall survival times
were evaluated from the time of initial presentation at our
center to the time of death. Kaplan–Meier estimates of
survival were obtained. Prognostic factors for overall survival were evaluated using log-rank test statistics, and
when significant in univariate analysis (p\0.05), factors
were also examined using multivariable Cox proportional
hazards modeling. The following predictors were considered: age, sex, Bismuth stage, histological confirmation,
reason of unresectability, and palliative treatment. P values\0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Results
Patient characteristics and resectability
The clinical characteristics of the study population are
summarized in Table 1. A total of 217 patients were
included in this evaluation. Of these, 103 patients were
deemed unresectable on the basis of imaging studies
(Table 1). Another 18 patients were found to be unresectable during staging laparoscopy, mostly because of peritoneal or liver metastases. During exploration, a further 38
patients were judged to be unresectable due to peritoneal
metastases (n = 5), liver metastases (n = 3), lymph nodes
beyond the hepatoduodenal ligament (n = 13), or locally
advanced disease (n = 14). Two of these patients underwent local hilar resection and biliary-enteric anastomosis.
The remaining 57 patients (26 %) underwent resection.
Surgical and pathological details of these patients are given
in Table 2. The reasons for unresectability in all patients
not resected (n = 160) were locally advanced disease
(n = 81), extrahepatic metastasis (n = 20), liver metastasis (n = 16), lymph node involvement beyond the hepatoduodenal ligament (n = 23), and unfitness for major
surgery (n = 19). Palliative chemotherapy, radiotherapy,
or photodynamic therapy was administered in 22, 8, and 8
patients, respectively.
Histological proof of malignancy was available in 168 of
the 217 (77 %) patients. In four patients, final histology of
the resection specimen showed benign inflammatory disease. No histological proof of malignancy was available in
the remaining 49 patients, generally after several negative
ERCP brush cytologies. Nonetheless, of these 49, 42 died
during follow-up, making malignancy the likely cause.
Survival
Mean and median follow-up time of all patients were 21 and
16 months (range = 0–100 months), respectively, and for
patients who had undergone resection, median survival was
30 months. Mean and median follow-up time of patients
alive were 48 and 46 months (range = 16–87 months),
respectively. Overall median and 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival
rates were 33 months and 85, 49 and 42 %, respectively, for

patients who underwent resection, excluding patients with
benign disease. Including the patients with benign disease,
these values were 37 months and 85, 51, and 43 %, respectively. Forty-four patients (83 % of resected patients with
malignant pathology) had a R0 resection with a median
survival of 49 months compared to a median survival of
19 months for patients with a R1 resection (p = 0.02).
Overall median and 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates of unresectable patients were 13 months and 52, 12 and 7 %,
respectively (Fig. 1). Survival of patients who underwent R1
resection was not significantly better than survival of unresectable patients (p = 0.22).
Survival of unresectable patients
Univariate and multivariate analyses of clinicopathological
parameters revealed that the cause of unresectability and
biliary drainage with a metal stent were the only independent predictors of survival (Table 3). Patients with liver
or extrahepatic metastases had a worse prognosis than
patients with other causes of unresectability (Fig. 2). There
was no difference in median survival in patients with
(13 months) or without (10 months) histological confirmation of malignancy (p = 0.10).
Seventeen unresectable patients (12 %) survived longer
than 36 months (range = 36–77 months); details of these
patients are given in Table 4. Most patients received a
metal stent, and when no metal stent was placed, the plastic
stents were replaced usually every 3 months. Interestingly,
six of eight patients still alive had no pathological confirmation of malignancy.
Discussion
This study assessed survival in the denominator of HCCA
patients referred to a tertiary referral center during a 7-year
period and evaluated prognostic factors of unresectable
patients. Twenty-six percent of these patients underwent
resection. Five-year overall survival rates of patients who
underwent resection and of unresectable patients were 43
and 7 %, respectively. This study represents one of the
largest published series of patients with HCCA (more than
200 patients) that also included unresectable patients. The
resectability rates vary substantially among published series (from 19 to 56 %) but are comparable with the 27 %
found in the current series, as seen in Table 5. The variation in resectability rates inherently depends on the referral
pattern of referring centers.
The 5-year-survival rate of 43 % in patients who had
undergone resection is high in comparison with other series, as seen in Table 5, but is consistent with survival data
from a more recent series from Japan [16]. We have
previously shown that long-term survival has steadily

improved in specialized centers over the years worldwide
[10], and the survival rate found in the current series seems
a promising continuation of this upward trend.
Still, 74 % of HCCA patients in the current study were
ultimately deemed unresectable and have a considerably
worse prognosis with a median survival of 13 months and
5-year survival of only around 7 %. On the other hand, the
7 % long-term survival in unresectable patients with
HCCA is rather surprising. We and others have shown that
around 10–15 % of pathology specimens of patients suspected for HCCA ultimately show benign disease [20].
Furthermore, the diagnosis of malignancy can be falsepositive as an effect of inflammation and stents. The
diagnosis of adenocarcinoma was confirmed histologically
in 77 % of patients, which is higher or in accordance with
other studies [8, 21]. However, a few patients in the group
with histologically unconfirmed malignancy may have
harbored benign disease, which in part explains the prolonged survival of unresectable patients found in this study.

However, there was no difference in survival of patients
with confirmed or unconfirmed unresectable disease,
whereas most patients with unconfirmed disease died during follow-up (42 of 49), suggesting a malignant cause of
their hilar obstruction. Lastly, long-term survival was also
found in patients with histologically confirmed malignancy, as seen in Table 4. Hence, besides patients with
benign lesions mimicking malignancy, the majority of
unresectable patients showing long-term survival apparently had indolent, slow-growing tumors, with a relatively
good survival, provided that adequate biliary drainage was
maintained to prevent death from unresolvable cholangitis.
In our perception, many patients die not as a result of the
expanding tumor but as a result of unresolvable cholangitis
complicating the clinical course. Nonetheless, we have
currently no data to support this and consequently this
remains speculation.
We also looked at the impact on survival of metal stents
versus plastic stents. This analysis was, however, substantially biased since almost all patients initially received
a plastic stent, which ideally was replaced by a metal stent
when unresectability was confirmed. Since most patients
who received a metal stent already had a plastic stent in
place, a valid comparison could not be made.
Clearly, the most important prognostic factor for
patients with HCCA is whether a resection can be performed. However, the only significant prognostic factor in
multivariate analysis for patients with unresectable disease

was the cause of unresectability; patients diagnosed with
liver metastasis or extrahepatic metastasis fared significantly worse than patients with other causes of unresectability. This finding is not surprising, yet in discussing
prognosis with a patient, it is helpful to present these
median survival times associated with the different causes
of unresectability. Furthermore, future studies exploring
interventions in patients with unresectable HCCA should
stratify the cause of unresectability since the cause substantially influences expected survival.
We realize the limitations of this study. First, data were
retrieved in a retrospective manner with its inherent
methodological drawbacks. Second, patients were treated
in a single tertiary referral center and results obviously
could be different in other hospitals. Finally, as described
above, pathological confirmation of unresectability was not
available in 25 % of patients and therefore maybe patients
with benign disease mimicking malignancy were included.
However, considering the median survival of only
10 months in patients without histological proof and the
high number of these patients who died during follow-up,
this group should be limited. Nonetheless, one should keep
in mind that patients diagnosed with unresectable HCCA
may ultimately have benign disease. Until we find more
accurate techniques to differentiate benign from malignant
biliary lesions, these patients will remain being diagnosed
with HCCA in the future.
Notwithstanding the above-mentioned limitations,
HCCA is a rare disease and because of the small numbers
encountered, even in specialized centers, randomized
studies are difficult to perform. As a result of the small
numbers, the study period of many studies is quite long,
introducing possible biases due to changes in management.
By including only patients over a 6-year period, we minimized this effect. By assessing an unselected group of
patients, we believe this study shows the daily management
of this disease.
In conclusion, of the patients who presented with HCCA
in our center, 26 % proved resectable. Five-year survival of
resected and unresectable patients was 43 and 7 %,
respectively, the latter including long-term survivors. The
5-year survival rate of 7 % for unresectable patients is
remarkable in the absence of effective chemotherapy or
radiation therapy, emphasizing the indolent growth of some
of these tumors. Patients with metastases had a much worse
prognosis with a median of 4 months.
