Percutaneous Angioplasty of Portal Vein
Stenosis that Complicates Liver
Transplantation: The Mid-Term
Therapeutic Results 
Objective: We wanted to valuate the mid-term therapeutic results of percutaneous transhepatic balloon angioplasty for portal vein stenosis after liver transplantation.
Materials and Methods: From May 1996 to Feb 2005, 420 patients underwent
liver transplantation. Percutaneous transhepatic angioplasty of the portal vein
was attempted in six patients. The patients presented with the clinical signs and
symptoms of portal venous hypertension or they were identified by surveillance
doppler ultrasonography. The preangioplasty and postangioplasty pressure gradients were recorded. The therapeutic results were monitored by the follow up of
the clinical symptoms, the laboratory values, CT and ultrasonography.
Results: The overall technical success rate was 100%. The clinical success
rate was 83% (5/6). A total of eight sessions of balloon angioplasty were performed in six patients. The mean pressure gradient decreased from 14.5 mmHg
to 2.8 mmHg before and after treatment, respectively. The follow up periods
ranged from three months to 64 months (mean period; 32 months). Portal venous
patency was maintained in all six patients until the final follow up. Combined
hepatic venous stenosis was seen in one patient who was treated with stent
placement. One patient showed puncture tract bleeding, and this patient was
treated with coil embolization of the right portal puncture tract via the left transhepatic portal venous approach.
Conclusion: Percutaneous transhepatic balloon angioplasty is an effective
treatment for the portal vein stenosis that occurs after liver transplantation, and
our results showed good mid-term patency with using this technique. 
nastomotic stenosis of the portal vein is a relatively infrequent vascular
complication that follows liver transplantation, and it is a potentially
serious complication that can possibly lead to graft loss (1, 2). With the
increasing incidence of living related or reduced size liver transplantation, percutaneous transhepatic angioplasty and stent insertion of the portal vein have gained
world-wide acceptance as a viable therapeutic alternative for these patients (3, 4). 
There have been a few reports that have dealt with the intermediate term follow-up
results of angioplasty for portal vein stenosis after liver transplantation (5, 6).
However, there have been very few reports on the mid-term and long-term follow up
for post-transplant portal venoplasty, and especially for the results of this procedure in
the Asian population. 
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the mid-term follow up on the therapeutic
responses to balloon angioplasty for portal venous stenosis after liver transplantation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Of the 420 consecutive liver transplantations performed
from May, 1996 to February, 2005, six patients (five males
and one female) underwent percutaneous transhepatic
angioplasty of the portal vein due to anastomotic stenosis.
Of the six patients, two of them were children and the
others were adults. The patients ranged in age from one
year to 53 years (mean age; 27 years). Five patients
received transplants from living related donors and one
patient underwent orthotopic liver transplantation. For the
patients who underwent living related liver transplantation, three patients received the left liver and two patients
received the right liver. The diseases underlying these liver
transplantations were as follows; three cases of liver cirrhosis, one case of hepatocellular carcinoma and two cases of
biliary atresia. 
The patients suffering with portal venous stenosis after
liver transplantation were identified by their clinical signs
and symptoms of portal hypertension or by surveillance
Doppler ultrasonography. The three patients who were
without any specific clinical manifestations were identified
on routine Doppler ultrasonography. Three patients
showed clinical symptoms and ascites. All the clinically
symptomatic patients also underwent Doppler sonography
and this confirmed their portal stenosis. The summary of
the patients is shown in Table 1.
The criteria of Doppler sonography for the detection of
portal vein stenosis were more than a 50% narrowing of
the stenotic segment diameter compared with the main
portal vein on the gray scale images in the adults, and a
portal vein segment diameter below 2.5 mm in the
pediatric patients. An increase of the portal flow velocity
to more than 40 cm/sec at the anastomosis site or a
postanastomotic jet flow noted on the Doppler US was
also used as the diagnostic criteria for portal vein stenosis. 
Technical success of the procedure was defined as less
than 30% residual stenosis being observed on venography
with the absence of variceal filling or collaterals. All the
stenoses were located at the extrahepatic portal vein
anastomosis sites. The ratio of the stenotic segment to the
patent main portal vein was measured for each patient. 
An informed consent was obtained from all the patients
or their guardians. The procedures were performed under
local anesthesia for four patients. The two pediatric
patients had their procedures performed under general
anesthesia. The transplanted liver was punctured with a
22G Chiba needle under fluoroscopic and ultrasound
guidance, and the needle was targeted to the peripheral
branch of the subcapsular portal vein. After achieving
confirmation of the portal puncture with a test dose
injection of contrast media, a 0.018-inch platinum-coated
nitinol guide wire (M.I. Tech, Seoul, Korea) was advanced
into the main portal vein. After changing the nitinol guide
wire to a 0.035-inch guide wire (Glidewire; Terumo,
Tokyo, Japan), a 6 8 Fr vascular sheath (COOK,
Bloomington, IN, USA) was inserted. The portal venogram
was obtained with a 5Fr Kumpe catheter (COOK,
Bloomington, IN, USA). The portal pressure was measured
at the postanastomotic main portal vein or at the level of
the hepatic hilar portal bifurcation. A disposable pressure
monitoring kit (Biosensors international, Singapore) was
used for measuring the portal pressure.
The stenotic segment was passed with the guide wire and
the prestenotic portal pressure was also measured.

Angioplasty was performed with the same diameter or
with a 10% larger diameter balloon than the diameter of
the nonstenotic extrahepatic portal vein. Careful serial
elevation of the balloon pressure was achieved by using
inflation devices (Merit Medical Systems, South Jordan,
UT, USA), and the balloon dilatation was continued until
there was a loss of the balloon’s waist. The elevated
balloon pressure at the fully dilated state was maintained
for 2 minutes. No intravenous or systemic heparinization
was used. Postangioplasty anticoagulation was achieved by
oral administration of aspirin 100 mg with or without
dipyridamole 25 mg per day. After the balloon dilatation
was completed, the postangioplasty portogram was
obtained and the puncture tract was embolized with
gelfoam (Cutanplast, Mascia Brunelli, Milano, Italy)
pledgets through the sidearm of the vascular sheath or the
angiographic catheter.
The clinical signs and symptoms, the laboratory values
including the liver function test, and the radiologic
monitoring of the Doppler sonographic results after the
balloon dilatation of the portal vein were performed.
RESULTS
The technical success rate of the portal vein angioplasty
was 100% (6/6). The clinical success rate was 83% (5/6). A
total of eight sessions of portal vein angioplasty were
performed in six patients. In two patients, two sessions of
angioplasty were performed and the recurrent stenoses
developed at 21 months and 31 months, respectively, from
the time of the initial angioplasty. In one pediatric patient
who had recurrent portal venous stenosis, the balloon
diameter was increased up to 30% more than the initial
procedure, and this stenosis was due to the age-related

growth of the portal vein that was noted at the time of the
second procedure. The repeated angioplasty procedures
led to clinical and angiographic improvement in these two
patients.
The balloon diameters ranged from 4-mm to 24-mm. The
diameters of the stenotic segments ranged from 1.4 mm 5
mm (mean; 2.9 mm) and the percent of stenosis ranged
from 75% to 85% (mean; 79%). The portal vein stenoses
occurred at between one and 31 months after liver
transplantation (mean period; 13.3 months).
The ratios of the stenotic segment to the main portal vein
were elevated to be from 0.2 to 0.66 before and after
treatment, respectively. The mean pressure gradient of the
portal vein before treatment was 14.5 mmHg and this was
decreased to 2.8 mmHg immediate after balloon dilatation.
In four patients, the difference of the pressure gradients
before and after angioplasty was 10 23 mmHg (mean
difference; 16.2 mmHg). In the other two patients, the
differences were 4 mmHg and 1 mmHg, respectively. All
the patients showed poststenotic dilatation of the intrahepatic portal vein on portal venography.
Portal vein thrombosis was seen in one patient and we
attempted to macerate the thrombus with the Hydrolyzer
thrombectomy catheter (Cordis, J&J Medical Systems, FL,
USA) system. However, this procedure was ineffective in
removing the thrombus, so we successfully macerated the
thrombus by using a large bore balloon (18 mm/4 cm)
catheter.
A complication occurred for one pediatric patient. This
patient received the left lobe lateral segment from the
donor and the transplanted left liver wholly occupied the
original liver bed from the right upper abdomen to the
midabdomen. The patient showed massive postprocedural
bleeding through the portal puncture tract at the right flank
in spite of performing gelfoam embolization of the tract.
Coil embolization of the portal puncture tract and the
adjacent peripheral portal branch was performed by using
the left transhepatic portal approach, and the bleeding was
finally stopped. 
One patient showed a subsequent increase in the amount

of ascites in spite of the successful portal venoplasty. The
CT scan revealed a combined hepatic venous stenosis and
it was treated with the insertion of a 14 mm diameter/4 cm
length self-expandable metallic stent (SMART Control,
Cordis, J&J Medical Systems, Miami Lakes, FL, USA). The
ascites decreased thereafter and the elevated liver enzymes
were normalized. However, this patient showed further
deterioration of the liver function in spite of the hepatic
venous stent placement. Repeated portal venograms were
performed, but portal vein flow and lumen were observed
to be well preserved. This deterioration finally led to graft
failure.
The length of the follow-up period ranged from three
months to 64 months (mean follow up; 32 months). Five
patients were completely free of their clinical symptoms
after their portal vein angioplasty. Postprocedural follow
up with doppler ultrasonography was performed in all six
patients and CT follow up was performed in three patients.
In four of the six patients, preprocedural doppler sonography showed a mean peak flow velocity of 125 cm/sec in
the stenotic segment of the portal vein. On the follow up
doppler sonography after portal venoplasty, we observed
the preservation of the dilated portal vein diameter and a
stable continuous wave on the spectral Doppler with less
than 40 cm/sec of peak flow velocity at the dilated
segment in all four patients. The other two patients showed
widely patent portal veins on their follow up CT scans.
DISCUSSION
Portal vein complications after liver transplantation,
including anastomotic stenosis or thrombosis, are relatively
uncommon vascular complications that occur in only 0.5
3% of patients (7 9). The incidence of these complications
is high for pediatric patients, for reduced-size liver
transplantation and for patients requiring intraoperative
reconstruction of the portal vein due to the discrepancy of
the vessel’s sizes, the limited length of the donor portal
vein and the grafts that are prone to delayed stenosis (6,
8). Although these complications have been traditionally
treated by such surgical interventions as retransplantation,
portacaval shunting or resection and reconstruction of the
anastomosis, such interventions are technically difficult for
surgeon to perform due to the postsurgical fibrosis around
the graft and the several complicating factors that
accompany this procedure (9 11). 
Since the first report of portal venoplasty by Raby et al.
(12), percutaneous balloon angioplasty for the portal vein
stenosis that occurs after liver transplantation has been a
widely accepted procedure for alleviating the symptoms of
portal hypertension and for preserving the graft. 
Although the long term follow up results of portal
venoplasty after liver transplatation in children and adolescents have already been reported on by Funaki et al. (13),
we now have some limited data regarding the mid-term
and long-term results. The mid-term results of portal vein
angioplasty after liver transplantation, as reported by
several authors, have dealt with the 28 33 month follow
up data (5, 6). Our study included both full-grown adults
and pediatric patients, and we presented the relatively
long-term follow up until 64 months. The patency of the
portal vein was well maintained in all the patients without
any clinical deterioration being noted. 
Thirty-three percentage of the patients in this study
required repeated sessions of portal venoplasty after liver
transplantation without the placement of stents. In one
patient who had recurrent stenosis of the portal vein, there
was no hemodynamically significant decrease of the
transstenotic pressure gradients. There was only a 4 mmHg
decrease in the pressure gradient after portal venoplasty in
this patient. Although some reports have considered a
transstenotic pressure gradient of more than 5 mmHg as
abnormal (2, 6, 8, 11), no standard guidelines for the
significant pressure gradient have yet been established. In
this patient with a 4 mmHg gradient, the post venoplasty
gradient was 0 mmHg and the clinical symptoms were
improved, along with the good follow up Doppler sonography results. However, the other patient with a 1 mmHg
post-venoplasty gradient showed further deterioration of
the liver function, and this led to graft failure. Godoy et al.
have reported on a case where in spite of the hemodynamically significant pressure drop (14 mmHg to 1 mmHg)
after portal venoplasty, the clinical symptoms persisted (2).
In addition, some authors believe that anastomotic stenosis
of the portal vein will respond differently to percutaneous
balloon angioplasty depending on their cause, the size of
the stenosis and the patients’ ages (6). Therefore, the
transstenotic pressure gradient does not seem to have any
direct correlation with the clinical and therapeutic results.
As seen in our case, portal venoplasty might not be so
helpful for patients whose clinical symptoms are possibly
related with graft dysfunction and not with the stenosis.
One pediatric patient showed restenosis of the portal vein
nine months from the first intervention, and the 24 months
follow-up CT after the second angioplasty showed a wellpreserved portal vein lumen and there was good function
of the graft.
One patient in our study showed a combined portal
venous thrombosis with their stenosis. The reports in the
literatures have shown that there is a high incidence of
portal vein thrombosis when the vascular conduits are used
to reconstruct the donor’s and the recipient’s portal veins

(13, 14). We attempted using the Hydrolyzer
Thrombectomy Catheter system to macerate the thrombus,
but the procedure was not successful. Portal vein occlusion
or thrombosis after liver transplantation has been treated
by a combination of thrombolysis, stent placement and
mechanical fragmentation (15 17). Therefore, we
performed a large profile balloon (18 mm/4 cm) dilatation
in the main portal vein to achieve both thrombus maceration and the portal vein dilatation. The follow up Doppler
ultrasonography showed that the small fragmented
thrombi had dislodged themselves into the intrahepatic
portal veins, and these were clinically insignifcant. The
fragmented thrombi completely disappeared on the final
follow up sonography.
Although the number of patients in our study was small,
our series showed clinical and therapeutic results equivalent to or slightly better that the previously published
midterm and long-term data regarding portal venoplasty
after liver transplantation. Metallic stenting was not
definitely indicated for the cases with recurred stenosis in
our series. The two patients who underwent a second
session of angioplasty maintained portal patency during
the 26 months and the 33 months follow up from the time
of the second session portal venoplasty, respectively. One
patient showed an unrelated graft dysfunction two months
after our initial intervention. However, the clinical
responses to balloon dilatation of portal venous stenosis
after liver transplantation can be unpredictable.
Morphologically and hemodynamically failed angioplasty
or the immediate recoiling of the stenotic segment will
require placement of a metallic stent. Because physicians’
total experience with posttransplantational portal stenosis
is somewhat limited, larger clinical studies are needed that
will include long term follow up.
In conclusion, portal venous angioplasty after liver
transplantation is a safe procedure for alleviating the signs
and symptoms of portal hypertension. Although stent
placement is a limited option for failed angioplasty,
repeated balloon dilatation is helpful for the majority of
cases.
