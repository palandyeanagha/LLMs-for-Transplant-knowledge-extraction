Abstract
In the absence of reliable data on the burden of hepatitis E virus (HEV) in high endemic
countries, we established a hospital-based acute jaundice surveillance program in six tertiary hospitals in Bangladesh to estimate the burden of HEV infection among hospitalized
acute jaundice patients aged �14 years, identify seasonal and geographic patterns in the
prevalence of hepatitis E, and examine factors associated with death.
We collected blood specimens from enrolled acute jaundice patients, defined as new
onset of either yellow eyes or skin during the past three months of hospital admission, and
tested for immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies against HEV, HBV and HAV. The enrolled
patients were followed up three months after hospital discharge to assess their survival status; pregnant women were followed up three months after their delivery to assess pregnancy outcomes. From December’2014 to September’2017, 1925 patients with acute
jaundice were enrolled; 661 (34%) had acute hepatitis E, 48 (8%) had hepatitis A, and 293
(15%) had acute hepatitis B infection. Case fatality among hepatitis E patients was 5% (28/
589). Most of the hepatitis E cases were males (74%; 486/661), but case fatality was higher
among females—12% (8/68) among pregnant and 8% (7/91) among non-pregnant women.
Half of the patients who died with acute hepatitis E had co-infection with HAV or HBV. Of the
62 HEV infected mothers who were alive until the delivery, 9 (15%) had miscarriage/stillbirth, and of those children who were born alive, 19% (10/53) died, all within one week of
birth. This study confirms that hepatitis E is the leading cause of acute jaundice, leads to
hospitalizations in all regions in Bangladesh, occurs throughout the year, and is associated
with considerable morbidity and mortality. Effective control measures should be taken to

Author summary
In the absence of reliable surveillance data on the burden of hepatitis E in endemic countries, we conducted a hospital-based acute jaundice surveillance study over a two and a
half year period in six tertiary hospitals in Bangladesh. The study confirms that HEV
infections occur throughout the year, and is a major (34%) cause of acute jaundice in tertiary hospitals in Bangladesh. Three-quarters of the acute hepatitis E cases were male, and
HEV infection was higher among patients residing in urban areas than patients in rural
areas (41% vs 32%). The overall case fatality rate of acute HEV infections in hospitals was
5%, but was higher among pregnant women (12%). Hepatitis E patients who died were
more likely to have co-infection with HAV or HBV than the HEV infected patients who
did not die. Fifteen percent of HEV infected mothers had miscarriage/stillbirth. Of the
children who were born alive, 19% died, all within one week of birth. Considering the
high burden of hepatitis E among hospitalized acute jaundice patients, Bangladesh could
take control measures to reduce this risk including improvements in water quality, sanitation and hygiene practices and the introduction of hepatitis E vaccine in high-risk areas.
Introduction
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection causes inflammation of the liver and is an important cause
of acute jaundice, especially in resource-poor countries, where fecal contamination of drinking
water is common [1–3]. HEV genotypes 1 and 2 are predominantly spread by the fecal-oral
route [4]. By contrast, HEV infection in high-income countries occasionally occurs as a result
of zoonosis of genotypes 3 and 4, being transmitted via exposure to wild animals, and consumption of undercooked pork or game meat [5,6]. HEV genotypes 1 and 2 in high-income
countries are generally limited to travellers to hepatitis E endemic countries [7,8].
HEV can cause sporadic cases and small outbreaks [9], but is often responsible for epidemics in Asia and many parts of Africa [1,10–12]. The most common clinical feature of symptomatic HEV infection is jaundice; it is symptomatically indistinguishable from other causes of
acute viral hepatitis [13]. Symptomatic illness due to HEV infection is infrequent in children
[14,15]; the infection primarily affects young adults, and is generally mild and self-limiting
[2,16,17]. However, the case fatality among HEV-infected pregnant women has been reported
to be as high as 6–30% [2,18–22]. Miscarriages, stillbirths and neonatal deaths are frequently
observed among HEV-infected pregnant women [20,23–25].
The World Health Organization (WHO) identified viral hepatitis as a global health problem
and set a goal to eliminate viral hepatitis by 2030 [26]. Even though an effective low-cost hepatitis E vaccine is available [27,28], the vaccine is not recommended for general use in endemic
countries, largely because the burden of disease is not quantified and so it is unclear if use of
the vaccine is appropriate and cost effective [29]. Hepatitis E disease surveillance data are limited to a few high-income countries [30,31]; most of the data from endemic countries are limited to disease outbreak and case series reports.
While hospital-based surveillance represents only the burden of severe HEV disease, it can
provide valuable insights, especially regarding the contribution to mortality among severe

acute jaundice patients. Patients with acute jaundice commonly present to hospitals in many
resource-poor hepatitis E endemic countries, including Bangladesh [32–34]. However, there
are few studies in hepatitis E endemic countries that systematically enrolled patients with
acute jaundice to estimate the burden of acute HEV infection in hospital settings, especially
the case fatality rate and delivery outcomes of pregnant women [35,36]. Previous hospitalbased studies in Bangladesh suggest that most of the cases of acute jaundice (22–64%) were
due to HEV infection, however, those studies were limited to a single study site or a short
study period which may not be a representative estimate of the burden of hepatitis E among all
hospitalized acute jaundice patients in Bangladesh [34,37,38].
The International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) in collaboration with the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) of the Government of Bangladesh, and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), conducted a hospital-based acute jaundice surveillance study in six tertiary hospitals
located in five regions of Bangladesh. The main objectives of this study were to estimate the
prevalence of HEV infection among acute jaundice patients aged �14 years admitted to tertiary hospitals in Bangladesh and estimate the case-fatality among these patients. Secondary
objectives included describing seasonal and geographic trends in the prevalence of HEV disease, identifying factors associated with mortality, measuring pregnancy outcomes and neonatal mortality of children born to mothers with acute HEV infection.
Methods
Surveillance sites and methods
Hospital-based acute jaundice surveillance was established in six tertiary hospitals, located in
five of seven divisions (the second highest level of geographic and administrative areas) in Bangladesh (Fig 1). Five of these were government teaching hospitals and one was a private teaching hospital. Severely ill patients are generally referred to these tertiary hospitals from lower
level hospitals located in the adjacent districts of the surveillance hospitals. The surveillance
started between 6 December 2014 and 27 March 2015 (depending on the hospital) and continued until 30 September 2017 in all six sites.
We recruited a physician in each of the six hospitals from the existing staff to oversee the
surveillance activities. A field assistant from icddr,b in each hospital assisted the surveillance
physicians to collect patient information and blood specimens, and to store and transport samples to the laboratory in Dhaka. Every weekday morning, the surveillance physicians visited
the obstetrics and gynaecology wards and the adult medicine wards of the hospitals and
reviewed admission records from the previous day to determine if any patients aged �14 years
met the case definition of acute jaundice. Due to resource constraints, we were unable to conduct surveillance in all wards in each hospital; therefore we restricted enrolment to adult medicine, obstetrics and gynaecology wards (where patients aged > 14 years are admitted) as
children have been reported to have less severe presentations of HEV infection [14,15].
Patients with acute jaundice admitted on Friday were enrolled on the next working day, as
study staff did not work on Fridays. Acute jaundice was defined as new onset of either yellow
eyes or skin for less than 3 months, and continuing on the day of admission. The field assistants also visited the intensive care unit (ICU) every weekday to ensure that no acute jaundice
cases were overlooked. If anyone met the case definition of acute jaundice, the surveillance
physicians recorded enrolled patients’ illness history and relevant clinical information (S1
Table) along with basic demographic information and contact information in a handheld
computer using a structured case investigation form. The surveillance physicians also collected
a 5 ml blood specimen for laboratory testing.

Sample processing and laboratory testing
On the same day of sample collection, the field assistants centrifuged the blood specimen and
prepared three aliquots of sera. One aliquot containing about 400μl of serum was sent to the
hospital laboratory the same day of sample collection to test for bilirubin and glutamic-pyruvic

transaminase to assess liver function. Two aliquots of serum were stored at the surveillance
hospitals in a liquid nitrogen dry shipper and transported to the laboratory of IEDCR in
Dhaka every two weeks. The samples were kept in a freezer at IEDCR at -80˚C until they were
tested. The samples were tested for IgM and IgG antibodies to HEV using enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits manufactured by Wantai, China (Beijing Wantai Biologic
Pharmacy Enterprise Co., Ltd, Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Acute HEV infection was defined as a positive test result for anti-HEV IgM antibodies. We
also tested all samples for hepatitis A virus IgM antibodies (anti-HAV IgM) (a marker of HAV
infection) and hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) (a marker of acute or chronic HBV
infection). The samples that were positive for HBsAg were also tested for hepatitis B virus core
IgM antibodies (anti-HBc IgM; a marker of acute HBV infection). Chronic HBV infection was
defined as a positive test result for HBsAg but negative test result for anti-HBc IgM. HBsAg
negative samples are generally negative for anti-HBc IgM [40], therefore, only the HBsAg positive samples were tested for anti-HBc IgM. ELISA test kits manufactured by DiaSorin, Italy
were used for testing anti-HAV IgM, HBsAg and anti-HBc IgM.
We sent a subset of samples (collected between December 2014 and December 2016) to the
Division of Viral Hepatitis Laboratory of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), Atlanta, USA to test for HEV RNA. All samples from patients with onset within three
weeks of the blood draw were selected for RNA testing. For other patients, a random sample of
20% of anti-HEV IgM positive samples, 20% of anti-HEV IgG positive samples, 20% of samples negative for both IgM and IgG were chosen to test for HEV RNA. Serum samples were
tested for HEV RNA using a quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) assay, capable of detecting HEV genotypes 1–3 with a limit of detection of 25
IU/ml, targeting a 69-bp fragment of open reading frame (ORF) 3 of HEV genome [41]. For
quality assurance, the samples that were sent to CDC were also retested for anti-HEV IgM
using the same ELISA kit as was used at the laboratory in Bangladesh.
Patient follow-up
All enrolled patients were followed up during their hospitalization by the surveillance physicians to monitor the outcomes of the illness episode and the pregnancy outcomes for pregnant
patients. If the pregnancy ended during hospitalization and the outcome was a live birth, the
surveillance physician examined the newborn to collect clinical information and note any
signs or symptoms of jaundice. All enrolled patients and the newborns were followed up 3
months post hospital discharge to ascertain their vital status. If a pregnant woman with jaundice was released from the hospital before the end of her pregnancy, the field assistants followed up with her by phone one week after the expected date of delivery and three months
after the date of delivery to check on the health of the mother and the newborn (S2 Table). For
patients who did not have a phone, the field assistants visited their home to follow-up. Follow
up three months post hospital discharge was not possible for the patients who were admitted
to surveillance hospitals after June 30, 2017, as the surveillance ended on September 30, 2017.
Data analysis
We calculated the prevalence of acute HEV infection among patients with acute jaundice in
each surveillance hospital and overall. Seroprevalence of acute hepatitis E was also calculated
by patients’ demographic characteristics and rural-urban area of residence. We compared the
signs and symptoms during illness, pregnancy complications, pregnancy outcome and case
fatality between acute jaundice patients with and without evidence of acute HEV infection. We
examined potential risk factors of death among patients with acute hepatitis E including coHepatitis E surveillance in Bangladesh

infection with other hepatitis viruses (HAV, HBV). Comparison between categorical variables
was performed using the chi-squared test or Fisher exact test where appropriate and comparison between continuous variables (non-normal distribution) was performed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. The 95% confidence interval for proportions was calculated by using the
Wilson method for a binomial distribution [42]. We examined the monthly trends in the number of patients with anti-HEV IgM antibodies. We also calculated the proportion of patients
positive for anti-HEV IgM and anti-HEV IgG by duration of illness at the time of admission to
hospital. The onset of illness was defined as the date when any sign and symptom developed,
including experiencing yellow eyes or skin or nausea/vomiting, or also fever, anorexia, abdominal pain, melaena, or unconsciousness. Analyses were conducted in Stata 14 (StataCorp).
Human subjects
The surveillance physicians sought consent from the patients, or their guardians in the case of
severely ill patients, to enrol them in the study. Written informed consent was obtained from
patients aged over 17 years. For patients aged between 14 and 17 years, written assent was
taken from the patients as well as obtaining written consent from their parents or guardians.
The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board of the icddr,b
(Protocol # PR-14060). US CDC involvement in the study did not constitute engagement in
human subjects research and therefore, CDC relied on appropriate IRB or ethics committee
approval of engaged institutions.
Results
Patient characteristics
In the six surveillance hospitals, a total of 2,091 patients aged �14 years met the case definition
of acute jaundice during December 2014 to September 2017. Of them, 1,925 (92%) agreed to
be enrolled in the study and provided a blood specimen for laboratory testing (S1 Fig). Of the
enrolled patients, 1,314 (68%) were male and 958 (50%) were aged between 14 and 29 years.
Of the female patients, 192 (31%) were pregnant. Patients admitted to the surveillance hospitals resided in 56 out of 64 districts in Bangladesh; however, a higher number of patients lived
near surveillance hospitals (Fig 1).
Laboratory testing and HEV seroprevalence
Among the 1,925 enrolled patients, 661 (34%) had IgM antibodies detected against HEV
(acute HEV infection) and 652 (99%) of these also had IgG antibodies against HEV. Overall,
1,036 (54%) patients had detectable anti-HEV IgG antibodies. There were 148 (8%) patients
who were positive for anti-HAV IgM antibodies and 663 (34%) who were positive for HBsAg.
Of the 663 HBsAg positive patients, 293 (15% of all patients) had acute HBV infection. Among
the 661 acute HEV patients, 9 (1%) also had acute HAV infection, 15 (2%) had acute HBV
infection and 132 (20%) had chronic HBV infection.
Of the 661 patients with acute HEV infection, 483 (73%) resided in rural areas, 486 (74%)
were male; their median age was 25 years (IQR: 20–33). Acute hepatitis E prevalence varied
across the hospital sites, ranging from 17% in Sylhet to 61% in Dhaka (Table 1). Among the
patients with acute jaundice, those who were male, aged between 20 to 39 years, resided in
urban areas, educated, or whose monthly family expenditure was >15,000 takas (US$188)
were more likely to have acute HEV infection (p<0.001). Acute HEV infection was higher
among the pregnant women with acute jaundice than the non-pregnant women with acute
jaundice (39% vs. 24%, p<0.001). The higher rate of acute HEV infection among educated and

higher income group patients with acute jaundice in the study hospitals was consistent in the
analysis by rural-urban area of residence (S3 Table).
Patients who were admitted to hospital between three and four weeks of onset of illness had
the highest anti-HEV IgM positivity (46%; Fig 2). The proportion who were anti-HEV IgM
positive declined with time after four weeks of onset of illness (χ2 for trend: 8.1; p <0.01).

Patients admitted to hospital with acute HEV infection were detected every month but no specific seasonal pattern was observed during the surveillance period (Fig 3). However, the number of hepatitis E cases generally increased over time.
Most of the signs and symptoms were similar for anti-HEV IgM positive and negative patients
(Table 2). However, oedema, distended abdomen, melaena and unconsciousness were observed
more often among anti-HEV IgM negative patients than anti-HEV IgM positive patients. The
median serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase level was significantly higher among anti-HEV
IgM positive patients than the anti-HEV IgM negative patients [520 (range: 221–1100) IU/L vs.
140 (range: 60–394) IU/L; p <0.001]. We included a list of clinical signs and symptoms of acute
jaundice patients that were collected at the time of hospital admission as an appendix (S1 Table).
Of the 115 anti-HEV IgM positive samples that were sent to CDC, 73 (64%) were positive
for HEV RNA; none of the anti-HEV IgM negative samples (n = 403) were positive for HEV
RNA. In CDC laboratory, all of the samples that tested anti-HEV IgM negative in Bangladesh
except one were negative (402 of 403) and all of the anti-HEV IgM samples that tested positive
in Bangladesh except two were positive (113 of 115).
Patient follow-up
Of the 1,925 patients with acute jaundice, we followed up 1,765 (92%), and of them 302 (17%)
died. Among those who died, 65 (22%) died during hospitalization and the remaining died

with HAV or HBV than the HEV infected patients who did not die (Table 3). Fourteen of the
28 deaths in HEV infected patients (50%) and 67 of 274 deaths in HEV uninfected patients
(24%) occurred within the first week of hospitalisation.
Among the 192 enrolled pregnant women, we followed up 173 (90%) until the outcome of
their pregnancy. Among the 66 mothers who were anti-HEV IgM positive, 53 (80%) had a live
birth and among the 107 mothers who were anti-HEV IgM negative, 72 (67%) had a live birth
(Table 4). Nineteen percent (10/53) of the live-born babies born to mothers with acute HEV
infection died compared to 7% (5/72) of babies born to women without HEV infection
(p = 0.038). The median age at death of the babies who were born to HEV infected mothers
was two days (IQR: 1–3 days; all within one week) and was five days (IQR: 2–8 days) for those
born to HEV uninfected mothers (p = 0.207). Of the 62 HEV infected mothers who were alive
until the delivery, 9 (15%) had a miscarriage/abortion or stillbirth.
Discussion
This study confirms that HEV is a major cause of acute jaundice, is often serious enough to
require hospitalization in all regions in Bangladesh, occurs throughout the year, and is associated with considerable mortality, especially among pregnant women and those co-infected
with other hepatitis viruses (HAV or HBV). Fifteen percent of HEV infected pregnant women
had a miscarriage or stillbirth, and of the children who were born alive, 19% died, all within
one week of birth. Three-quarters of the acute hepatitis E cases in hospitals were male, and
HEV infection was higher among patients residing in urban areas than patients in rural areas
(41% vs 32%).
Previous estimates of hepatitis E prevalence among hospitalized acute jaundice patients in
other endemic countries ranges from 10–70% [35,36]. One study in Bangladesh tested 22 fulminant hepatitis patients admitted in a tertiary hospital and detected acute HEV infection
among 64% of the patients [37]. Another study in Bangladesh tested 69 retrospectively collected samples from admitted acute-on-chronic liver failure patients in the hepatology unit of
a tertiary hospital and identified acute HEV infection among 22% of the samples [34]. The
large variation of hepatitis E prevalence might be due to the small number of patients
recruited, geographic location of hospitals, and the types of patients recruited. One study that
recruited a large number of acute hepatitis patients (685 patients during four years) from the
liver clinic of a tertiary hospital in India reported the prevalence of hepatitis E as 39% [43],
which is similar to the estimate in our study.
About three-quarters of laboratory-confirmed HEV infected patients were males. One
explanation for this may be that males are more involved in outdoor activities than females in
low- and middle-income countries [44], putting them at higher risk for exposure to contaminated drinking water. Other reasons for this observation could be due to gender differences in
health-seeking behaviour and access to health services. A recent study noted that healthcare
expenditure on females is significantly lower than on males in low-income settings [45].
Hepatitis E patients were more likely to be more educated, reside in urban areas and from a
high-income group than HEV negative acute jaundice patients. Higher HEV infection rates
among educated and high-income group patients might be associated with higher exposure to

contaminated drinking water due to their greater involvement in jobs outside the home as
reported in previous studies [12,46]. An alternative explanation might be that children in low
socio-economic groups are exposed to pathogens frequently at a young age and so develop
robust immunity that protects them from clinically severe illness later in life [47]. This pattern
of higher risk of illness among wealthier adolescents and young adults has been observed in
some other fecal-oral transmitted diseases, most notably hepatitis A and typhoid fever [48–50].
Higher HEV infection among patients who resided in urban areas might be related to higher
possibility of fecal contamination of drinking water sources in urban settings. In large cities in
Bangladesh, municipal water pipes are commonly exposed to sewerage lines which may lead to
fecal contamination of drinking water [51].
Although males and non-pregnant females who were HEV IgM negative were more likely
to die than those with HEV infection, the case fatality in pregnancy was similar between both
groups. Furthermore, the occurrence of stillbirths and miscarriages was also common in both
HEV and non-HEV acute jaundice patients. However, the neonatal mortality among children
born to mothers with HEV infection was significantly higher than the children born to mothers without HEV infection. The higher proportion of neonatal deaths among mother with
HEV infection might be explained by the well-described risk of maternal to child transmission
of HEV, or the frequency of pre-term delivery [23,25,52]. However, further research is
required to understand the contribution of the vertical transmission of HEV to fetal and neonatal mortality, and the mechanism of maternal response to HEV infection.
Although most reported hepatitis E epidemics have been related to fecally contaminated
drinking water in the rainy season and hot summer months [13], we did not observe any
strong seasonal trend. However, an increase in the number of HEV IgM positive cases was
reported from the Chittagong Medical College Hospital during Sep-Oct, 2016 and from the
Barishal Medical College Hospital during Jun-Sep, 2017. The unusually high number of cases
suggests that there might have been an outbreak in those months which was undetected in
real-time, perhaps due to delays in laboratory testing. There were no reported hepatitis E outbreaks in Bangladesh during the surveillance period. A previous study conducted in a private

laboratory in Dhaka identified small outbreaks of HEV infections throughout the year [9]. The
patients in our surveillance hospitals might be sporadic cases of hepatitis E or cases from small
outbreaks that occurred throughout the year, as was observed in that study [9].
There are a number of limitations of our study. We observed a declining trend in HEV
infection positivity by the duration of onset of illness at the time of hospitalization (Fig 2).
Anti-HEV IgM antibody titres might have waned for patients who were admitted to hospital
in the later stage of their illness [53]; this may lead to an underestimate the rate of HEV infection among acute jaundice patients. In our study, we used Wantai ELISA which is largely
accepted as the most sensitive among the available commercial assays [54]. However, the study
conducted by Huang et al. observed that about 3% of acute hepatitis cases (defined as acute
liver damage evidenced by a 2.5 fold upper limit of the normal level of alanine aminotransferase) were negative for anti-HEV IgM (using the Wantai kit) but had a 4-fold rise in anti-HEV
IgG in their convalescent sera [53], which indicates an acute HEV infection [55–57]. Therefore, our results likely underestimate the true prevalence of acute hepatitis E due to the performance of the test kit. HEV infections are generally self-limiting and do not require
hospitalization [2] and the patients admitted in tertiary hospitals are severely ill; therefore, the
findings in our study represent only the prevalence of hepatitis E among severely ill patients.
Finally, in our study, the etiological agent of acute jaundice was unknown for about one-third
of the patients, and the samples were not tested for hepatitis C virus.
This study provides a reliable estimate of the prevalence of HEV infection among hospitalized patients with acute jaundice in a hepatitis E endemic country by enrolling patients admitted from a wide geographic area through systematic surveillance over a two and a half year
period. It confirms that hepatitis E is the leading cause of acute jaundice in Bangladesh. We
identified a high prevalence of hepatitis E among patients with acute jaundice in all of the hospitals included in the study and throughout the multiple ecological zones in Bangladesh. Hepatitis E is therefore a considerable public health problem in Bangladesh. Considering the high
burden of HEV among hospitalized patients with acute jaundice, Bangladesh could consider
to take control measures to reduce this risk including improvements in water quality, sanitation and hygiene practices and the introduction of hepatitis E vaccine in high-risk areas. An
improved understanding of the burden of hepatitis E is required in other endemic countries to
plan for effective global actions to prevent HEV infections including the introduction of hepatitis E vaccine.
