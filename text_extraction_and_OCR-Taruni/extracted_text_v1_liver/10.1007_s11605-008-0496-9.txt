Abstract
Objective This study was undertaken to examine the effect of cirrhosis on elective and emergent umbilical herniorrhapy
outcomes.
Methods Procedures were identified from the Veterans’ Affairs National Surgical Quality Improvement Program at 16
hospitals. Medical records and operative reports were physician abstracted to obtain preoperative and intraoperative
variables.
Results Of the 1,421 cases reviewed, 127 (8.9%) had cirrhosis. Cirrhotics were more likely to undergo emergent repair
(26.0% vs. 4.8%, p<0.0001), concomitant bowel resection (8.7% vs. 0.8%, p<0.0001), return to operating room (7.9% vs.
2.5%, p=0.0006), and increased postoperative length of stay (4.0 vs. 2.0 days, p=0.01). Best-fit regression models found
cirrhosis was not a significant predictor of postoperative complications. Significant predictors of complications were
emergent case (OR 5.4; 95% CI 3.1–9.4), diabetes (OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.2–3.8), congestive heart failure (OR 4.0; 95% CI 1.4–
11.4), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR 2.0; 95% CI 1.1–3.6). Among emergent repairs, cirrhosis (OR 4.4;
95% CI 1.3–14.3) was strongly associated with postoperative complications.
Conclusion Elective repair in cirrhotics is associated with similar outcomes as in patients without cirrhosis. Emergent repair
in cirrhotics is associated with worse outcomes. Early elective repair may improve the overall outcomes for patients with
cirrhosis.

Introduction
The prevalence of umbilical hernias in cirrhotic patients with
ascites is as high as 20%, with recurrence rates after repair in
those patients as high as 60%.1,2 Obesity, chronic cough,
smoking, and ascites are contributing factors to the development of umbilical hernias in adults.3 The increased intraabdominal pressure associated with ascites is thought to
predispose cirrhotic patients to the development of umbilical
hernias.
Cirrhotic patients are considered to be high surgical risk,
with increased perioperative morbidity and mortality.4,5
Among good risk patients, umbilical herniorrhaphy is a
relatively straightforward operation with low morbidity and

mortality. Complications of umbilical hernias in cirrhotic
patients include leakage, ulceration, rupture, and incarceration.2 Repair of umbilical hernias in the cirrhotic patients has
been associated with elevated morbidity, mortality, and
recurrence rates.6 Surgery in cirrhotic patients is considered
by many surgeons to be high risk, and there is a tendency to
reserve umbilical hernia repair (UHR) until bowel-related
complications develop, such as incarceration, strangulation,
rupture, ulceration, and leakage of ascitic fluid.7 The
development of incarceration, strangulation, ulceration, and
rupture further elevate the risk of surgical repair. Additionally, surgical repair of incarcerated hernias in cirrhotic
patients is associated with an elevated morbidity and
mortality rate.2,7,8
Prior studies have documented increased morbidity and
mortality among cirrhotic patients undergoing emergent
surgical procedures.9,10 The aim of this study is to describe
the effect of cirrhosis on short-term UHR outcomes. We
examine the effect of preoperative comorbidities obtained
from the Veterans’ Affairs National Surgical Quality
Improvement Program (VA NSQIP) data and surgery
specific variables obtained from operative note abstraction.
We specifically focus on the effect of emergent or elective
case status on UHR outcomes, especially postoperative
complications and hospital resource allocation.
Materials and Methods
Study Design
This is a retrospective cohort analysis of subjects undergoing
UHR at 16 VA Medical Centers (VAMC) affiliated with
surgical residency programs across the USA between 1998
and 2002. Institutional review board approval and waiver of
informed consent was obtained at all participating VAMCs.
Eligible procedures were identified by querying the VA
NSQIP database by Current Procedure Terminology (CPT)
codes for ventral hernia repair (49560, 49561, 49565, 49566,
49568, 49570, 49572, 49580, 49585, 49587, 49590, and
49659). Individual operative notes obtained from each site
were physician abstracted to identify the type of hernia repair,
method of repair, intraoperative enterotomy or bowel resection, and other operative variables. Outcome variables were
obtained from the VA NSQIP, the VA National Patient Care
Database, and the computerized patient record system
(CPRS).
Study Databases
The VA NSQIP prospectively collects data from all 123 VA
facilities that perform surgery and includes preoperative,
intraoperative, and postoperative outcome variables. The
VA NSQIP accrues the CPT code and date of procedure on
all non-cardiac cases performed in the VA system.
Additional risk variables are collected on a subset of
patients based on a sampling algorithm that minimizes bias
from high-volume centers and roughly includes 70% of all
major operations performed.11,12 Thirty-day morbidity and
mortality data, operative time, and length of stay were
obtained from the VA NSQIP database.
The VA National Patient Care Database is comprised of
the Patient Treatment File (PTF) and the Outpatient Care
Files (OPC).13 The PTF is a national VA database that
includes all admissions to VA hospitals along with up to ten
ICD-9 diagnostic and procedure codes. The OPC is a
national VA database that contains information on all
ambulatory contacts with VA staff.
The CPRS is the comprehensive electronic medical record
available through web access. Chart abstraction for patients
with cirrhosis identified from the PTF and the OPC was
performed to confirm the diagnosis of cirrhosis.
Study Population
Based on VA NSQIP query, we identified all patients at the
16 VA hospitals with CPT codes listed above. Patients were
excluded if the repair was not an umbilical hernia repair
(i.e., incisional hernia repair or ventral hernia repair), if
there was a same site concomitant procedure (i.e., cholecystectomy or planned colectomy), if their operative note
was not available for abstraction, or if the case had one or
more missing NSQIP preoperative risk variables.
Study Variables
The main variable of interest, cirrhosis, is not included in the
VA NSQIP dataset. Cirrhosis was defined by the presence of
an associated ICD-9 code in the medical record. The PTF and
OPC were queried with ICD-9 codes for chronic liver disease
and cirrhosis (571), alcoholic cirrhosis of liver (572.2),
cirrhosis of liver without mention of alcohol (571.5), and
biliary cirrhosis (571.6). The presence of ascites is a VA
NSQIP variable defined as the presence of fluid accumulation
within the peritoneal cavity noted on physical examination or
abdominal imaging within 30 days before the operation.
Additional variables of interest were patient-level demographics (age and gender), preoperative comorbid conditions, technique of repair, history of prior repair, and
intraoperative variables. The presence of any full-thickness
bowel-wall injury recorded in the operative note was
considered an enterotomy. The occurrence of a bowel
resection documented in the operative record that was not
planned before operation was included in this analysis. The
presence of bowel strangulation or obstruction recorded in
the operative note was considered an indication of
676 J Gastrointest Surg (2008) 12:675–681

compromised bowel. Preoperative risk factors were defined
using the VA NSQIP definitions. A dichotomous variable
was constructed for technique of repair to classify repairs as
either suture or mesh.
The effect of cirrhosis on UHR outcomes was examined.
Dichotomous outcomes of interest were the occurrence of one
or more postoperative complications or return to operating
room within 30 days of the original operation. Continuous

outcomes of interest were operative time and postoperative
length of hospitalization.
Statistical Analysis
Univariate analysis of demographics and operative variables
were performed to describe the study population. Chi-square
tests were performed to examine differences in proportions
between cases based on the diagnosis of cirrhosis and the
occurrence of one or more postoperative complications.
Multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine
the effect of cirrhosis on postoperative complications by case
status. Those variables with p<0.1 in testing of univariate
association with complications were used as main effects in
logistic regression analysis. Stepwise backward elimination
was employed to achieve a best-fit logistic regression model.
All statistical tests were performed using Statistical Analysis
Software (SAS version 9.1; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
Results
Of the 1,421 procedures available for analysis, 1,370 (97.7%)
were on men, and the median age was 55 years old. Overall,

there was documentation of cirrhosis in 127 (8.9%) UHR
procedures. History of ascites was documented within 30 days
before operation in 53.5% (n=68) of patients with cirrhosis.
The study population is comprised of 1,302 (92.5%) primary
and 105 (7.5%) recurrent umbilical hernia repairs. Elective
procedures accounted for 93.3% of the study population.
There were no differences in patient gender, race, age,
chronic steroid use, congestive heart failure (CHF), diabetes,
or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) based on
the presence of cirrhosis (Table 1). There was a higher
prevalence of smoking and alcohol abuse among cirrhotic
patients. A higher proportion of cirrhotic patients underwent
emergent repair (26.0% vs. 4.8% p<0.0001) and repair of a
recurrent hernia (11.8% vs. 7.0% p=0.05) compared to
patients without cirrhosis. A higher proportion of cirrhotic
patients had indications of compromised bowel at the time of
UHR (10.3% vs. 1.4% p<0.0001). Recent history of ascites
was documented in 22.1% (n=28) of cirrhotics who
underwent emergent repair.
Postoperative complications occurred in 6.1% (n=86) of
patients undergoing UHR (Table 2). There were six deaths
documented within 30-days of the operation, one of those
patients had cirrhosis. Overall, patients with cirrhosis,
alcohol abuse, tobacco, or chronic steroid use were no
more likely to develop postoperative complications within
30 days. There was an increased incidence of complication
among patients with ascites, CHF, diabetes, and COPD.
Complications were more likely after emergent repair
(24.2% vs. 4.8%, p<0.0001) and repair with indications
of compromised bowel (32.3% vs 5.4%, p<0.0001). There
was a significant association between cirrhosis and the
occurrence of bowel resection (8.7% vs. 0.8%, p<0.0001),
as well as emergent case status and occurrence of bowel
resection (19.0% vs. 0.2%, p< 0.0001). Additionally,
patients with cirrhosis were more likely to return to the
operating room within 30 days of UHR (7.9% vs. 2.5%, p=
0.0006). Patients who underwent emergent repair, compared to elective repair, were no more likely to return to the
operating room within 30 days of UHR.
There was a significant difference in operative time and
postoperative length of stay in patients with cirrhosis versus
those without cirrhosis (Table 3). Additionally, postoperative
length stay was greater in emergent compared to elective
UHR. However, comparing only elective UHR in patients
with and without cirrhosis, there was no difference in
operative time or postoperative length of stay. Whereas
patients with cirrhosis undergoing emergent UHR had a
longer length of stay compared to non-cirrhotics undergoing
emergent repair.
Best-fit logistic regression models of predictors of postoperative complications demonstrated that cirrhosis was not a
significant predictor of complications in the overall study
group or among elective UHR patients. However, cirrhosis
was a predictor of a greater than threefold increase in
complications among emergent UHR patients (Table 4). The
overall model incorporates age, case status, indications of
bowel compromise, smoking status, diabetes, COPD, CHF,
cirrhosis, and hernia repair history. The elective and
emergent models incorporates age, indications of bowel
compromise, smoking status, diabetes, COPD, CHF, cirrhosis, and hernia repair history.

Discussion
In this multi-site study, we found that elective UHR in
cirrhotics is safe and associated with similar outcomes as in
patients without cirrhosis. We found that patients with
cirrhosis were more likely to undergo emergent UHR.
Patients with cirrhosis had poor outcomes after emergent
UHR, and cirrhosis is a significant predictor of postoperative complications after emergent UHR.
Our data demonstrates that cirrhosis is not a significant
predictor of postoperative complications for the overall study
population or patients undergoing elective UHR. Prior studies
have documented increased morbidity and mortality among
cirrhotic patients undergoing emergent surgery.5,9,10 A previous study demonstrated an increased incidence of emergent
hernia repair among cirrhotic patients, as well as increased
complications, hospital resource utilization, and mortality.8
Our data demonstrates that cirrhosis is a significant predictor
of postoperative complications after emergent UHR only.
Other studies have demonstrated that cirrhotic patients
tolerate elective hernia repair, especially if ascites is
controlled preoperatively.14,15 Our study supports elective
repair of umbilical hernias among cirrhotic patients.
We found a significant association between cirrhosis and
bowel resection, likely due to the incidence of strangulation, incarceration, and obstruction leading to the emergent
UHR. We have previously shown that the occurrence of an
enterotomy or bowel resection in elective incisional hernia
repair is associated with increased postoperative complications, rate of return to the operating room, operative time,
and postoperative length of stay.16
Our models of postoperative complications illustrate the
role of diabetes and COPD on the development of complications regardless of case status. Previous studies have found
that hyperglycemia is an independent predictor of short-term
infectious complications.17,18 Among critically ill patients,
intensive insulin therapy (glucose level less than 110 mg/dl)
is associated with decreased incidence of blood stream
infections, acute renal failure, blood transfusion, ventilator
support, intensive care utilization, and reduced overall inhospital mortality.19 Other studies have shown COPD to be
an independent risk factor for the development of surgical
site infections.20,21 Our data reinforces the importance of
optimizing medical comorbidities before UHR.
Our study has several limitations. The incidence of
cirrhosis was ascertained from administrative data and
likely underestimates the true incidence. Similarly, the
mortality data was ascertained from administrative data
and may underestimate the mortality rate. Unfortunately, a
number of cirrhotic patients are missing preoperative lab
values, which limits our ability to classify the degree of
hepatic impairment among the cirrhotic patients. Finally,
the incidence of postoperative complications in elective
umbilical hernia repair is low, and we may lack power to
detect a difference in complications between patients with
and without cirrhosis in the elective subgroup.
Conclusion
We found that elective UHR in cirrhotics is safe and
associated with similar outcomes as in patients without
cirrhosis. However, emergent repair of UHR in patients
with cirrhosis is associated with worse outcomes. Early
elective repair of umbilical hernias may improve the overall
outcomes for patients with cirrhosis.
