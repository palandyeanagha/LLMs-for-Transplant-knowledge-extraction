Many physiological properties of the renal system influence nutrient metabolism,
elimination, and homeostasis. Kidney failure poses significant challenges to maintaining
adequate nutrition, most of which transplantation ameliorates. Comprehensive
recommendations for managing nutritional derangements for patients with chronic kidney
disease and end stage renal disease exist; however, there are only sparse guidelines
for post-transplant malnutrition and adverse outcomes. Not only are guidelines limited,
but little is known about dietary trends of post-kidney transplant recipients. This review
describes guidelines for prevalent metabolic and nutritional complications post-kidney
transplantation and also evaluates changes in caloric intake and diet composition after
transplantation. This topic is important because nutrition influences allograft function
and a number of cardiovascular risk factors including blood pressure, dyslipidemia,
weight, and diabetes. In addition, many dietary recommendations and modifiable lifestyle
changes should be tailored for specific complications of transplant patients, namely
immunosuppression side effects, dietary restrictions, and electrolyte imbalances.

INTRODUCTION
Many physiological properties of the renal system influence nutrient metabolism, elimination,
and electrolyte homeostasis. Kidney failure poses a significant challenge to maintaining adequate
nutrition and muscle mass. Protein-calorie malnutrition and muscle mass loss, which has been
linked to increased mortality after transplant (1, 2), is prevalent in up to a fifth of kidney transplant
recipients at time of transplant (3). Thus, establishing a healthy diet and metabolic profile to
correct pre-transplant malnutrition and prevent progression or development of malnutrition
post-transplant is of vital importance.
Prevention of several adverse post-transplant outcomes such as cardiovascular disease,
dyslipidemia, new onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT), and even bone loss can be
achieved through diet and exercise. Although numerous studies report weight gain after kidney
transplantation (KT) (4–7) there are limited guidelines addressing diet or physical activity for this
population to deter this unwanted gain.
Transitioning from end stage renal disease to transplantation poses a metabolic challenge due
to hormonal shifts, energy expenditure variance, and the metabolic derangements associated with
immunosuppression therapies. Additionally, food restrictions vary pre- and post-transplant, from

Nolte Fong and Moore Nutiriton Considerations for Kidney Transplant Recipients
avoiding phosphorus-rich dairy and high-potassium foods
on dialysis to avoiding food-borne pathogens post-transplant
[although there is limited evidence to support this particular
common diet recommendation (8)]. These, along with other
lifestyle changes, influence the health behaviors of kidney
transplant recipients.
The purpose of the article is to review current nutritional
guidelines for post-kidney transplant patients and highlight
nutrition trends and results from dietary interventions.
Pre-transplant malnutrition along with a full review of
micronutrients and electrolytes are not the scope of this
paper, however, should not go without consideration.
METHODS
PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic
Reviews were searched for the articles included in this review.
These articles were also reference-mined for determining
other relevant references. Articles focusing on micronutrient
contribution to nutrition pre-KT were excluded. Due to the
volume of micronutrient and electrolyte derangements, the top
three most frequently studied micronutrients were included.
PRACTICE GUIDELINES
There are seven major authorities with similar approaches
for creating renal clinical practice guidelines worldwide (9).
The Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO)
workgroup developed clinical practice guidelines based on a
methodic evidence-based analysis process specifically focused
on prevention of post-transplant complications (10). The
KDIGO guidelines do not offer insights specifically on dietary
recommendations for kidney transplant recipients. Rather,
the guidelines focus more on the management of metabolic
derangements: diabetes mellitus and NODAT; hypertension,
dyslipidemia, and obesity; cardiovascular disease; and transplant
bone disease.
Furthermore, a systematic review in 2009 revealed that
of 119 relevant articles, there was no scientific evidence of
a grade I or II that exists for dietary recommendations for
kidney transplant recipients (11). Although guidelines exist for
common comorbidities of KT for the general population, specific
considerations in KT must be incorporated into developing
quality guidelines to prevent or control metabolic disorders posttransplant.
MACRONUTRIENTS
Macronutrients comprise a pivotal aspect of nutrition guidelines.
Here we briefly explore each macronutrient with post-transplant
complications and comorbidity prevention in mind.
Fat
Lipids present a large portion of the American diet (12), and
it is recommended for adults to consume between 20 and
35% of calories from fat while maintaining 10% or less from
saturated fatty acids (13). Comorbidities associated with elevated
fat intake include dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, cardiovascular
disease, and high blood pressure—all elevated risk factors after
kidney transplantation—enhance the likelihood of developing
cardiovascular disease (CVD) (14).
Mechanisms of energy storage and utilization link free fatty
acids (FFAs) to insulin resistance (IR) through various cell
signaling pathways that are regulated by insulin (15). Weight
gain, particularly visceral fat gain, elevates FFA concentration and
enhances insulin resistance via inhibiting insulin receptors on the
cellular membrane (16).
In a cohort of 85 KTR, insulin resistance [measured by the
homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR)] had no significant
association with FFA (p = 0.09) nor controls (p = 0.24). However,
when controlling for sex, an association between FFA and IR
was found in males (p = 0.002) but not females (p = 0.04).
Regarding atherosclerotic events, FFA have shown contrasting
impact on renal epithelium in vivo (17). Albumin, filtered
through the proximal tubule during proteinuria, serves as a
carrier protein for FFA, and these protein-bound fatty acids may
contribute renal damage caused by proteinuria (18). Klooster
et al. demonstrated that non-esterified fatty acids bound to
albumin showed a reduced risk of graft failure (HR = 0.61,
p < 0.001) in a model controlling for gender in KTR (n = 461)
(19). Mechanisms for this effect have not been elucidated, nor has
the exogenous fatty acid profile been scrutinized to optimize the
renoprotective benefits. This study also found no difference in
diabetic parameters, i.e., HgbA1c and insulin resistance, among
tertiles of non-esterified fatty acids concentrations.
Furthermore, studies showing the protective effect on renal
epithelium associated with monounsaturated fatty acids (20, 21)
and polyunsaturated fatty acids [eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA),
docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA)],
have mixed outcomes within the KTR population (22). A posthoc analysis of 673 KTR with food frequency questionnaires
demonstrated a relationship between omega-3 fatty acids and
graft and patient outcomes (23). When divided into tertiles based
on dietary ALA intake, the highest tertile was associated with
twice the risk of mortality compared to the lowest tertile (HR
2.21; 95% CI 1.23, 3.97). The authors suggested glucocorticoid
steroids may contribute to this by altering the ALA:EPA-DHA
ratio through inhibition of the 15 and 16 desaturates (24)—the
rate limiting step in converting ALA into EPA and DHA (24, 25).
No omega-3 fatty acids were associated with graft loss.
A Cochrane database review demonstrated that there is not
enough evidence to recommend the use of omega-3 fatty acid
supplementation due to only modest improvements in high
density lipoprotein and diastolic blood pressure (22). The main
concern regarding this topic in transplantation is a lack of welldesigned, prospective, placebo-controlled studies of omega-3
fatty acid supplementation (or a dietary regimen).
Dietary lipids can have a direct impact on the health and
function of renal tissues, but stored body fat, in particular as
a result of post-transplant weight gain, plays a role in disease
development as well. Although the prevalence of sarcopenia
and malnutrition are high pre-KT (2), clinicians must be
cognizant of the type of weight gained and where the weight is
deposited.

Nolte Fong and Moore Nutiriton Considerations for Kidney Transplant Recipients
Protein
Dietary recommendations for protein intake have been studied
extensively in patients with CKD (26) but very few guidelines
exist for kidney transplant recipients. Increased protein intake is
associated with elevated blood pressure, secondary graft failure,
and cardiovascular events.
Important considerations post-transplant include preventing
muscle loss after surgery and achieving positive nitrogen balance.
Associated short-term factors include wound healing and the
added stress of surgical insult to the body. The early increased
need for protein utilization should be accompanied by adequate
dietary intake to limit a negative protein balance. Protein
recommendations immediately post-operatively range from 1.3
to 2 g/kg of body weight (27).
A review concluded that there is no definitive guideline
regarding protein recommendations peri-operatively for kidney
transplant patients (28). With a lack of long-term evidence for
protein needs post-transplant, an acceptable range to consume
for allograft and overall physiological maintenance is 0.75 g/kg/d
for females and 0.8 g/kg/d for males (28).
Carbohydrate
Despite increased awareness of NODAT and complications early
post-transplant, there is no consensus on treatment or therapies
(29). Carbohydrates (CHO) contribute the highest amount of
energy in the typical American diet, making up 50% of total
kilocalories from a recent report from 2007 to 2012 NHANES
data (12). The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend
a diet with carbohydrate intake of 45–65% of total kilocalories
(13). Hyperglycemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in nontransplant patients who followed a low glycemic diet were found
to have reduced risk of micro- and macro-vascular complications
(30).
Persistent excess CHO intake that is broken down into
glucose causes an increased risk for developing dyslipidemia,
metabolic syndrome and NODAT. In a recent retrospective
analysis of 407 patients, age (p = 0.018), high density lipoprotein
(HDL) (p = 0.010), and average tacrolimus trough level
(p < 0.0001) were risk factors for hyperglycemia post-transplant
(31). Similarly, predictors of recurrent hyperglycemia included
age (p < 0.0001), HDL (p = 0.003), non-White race (p = 0.002),
and using steroids (p = 0.007). Conversely, a larger retrospective
study found that incidence of NODAT depended on the
immunosuppression regimen and that steroid-free regimens
reduced the odds of developing diabetes after transplantation
by 42% after 3 years (32). To date, the only prospective,
double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of the use
of corticosteroids vs. placebo in kidney transplant recipients
determined that early (day 7 post-transplant) withdrawal of
corticosteroids had little impact on the development of NODAT
over the 5-year follow-up period (33). This study further
demonstrated no difference in weight gained between the
corticosteroid withdrawal group and the group maintained on
corticosteroids during the 5-year study (34), strongly suggesting
that the development of NODAT and the post-transplant weight
gain is not due to the use of corticosteroids in the current era.
This study did not evaluate dietary intake of the participants.
Considerations peri-transplant involve high dose
corticosteroid use and wound healing (35). Furthermore,
the innate stress response from the surgery initiates a cascade
of hyperglycemia. Elevated serum glucose increases the risk of
blood stream infections (36) and hampers wound healing (37)
Furthermore, hyperglycemia increases reactive oxygen species
that may exhaust antioxidants pools (38).
KEY MICRONUTRIENTS
There are several electrolytes and micronutrients that use
the renal system for excretion and reabsorption, most of
which are altered by immunosuppression therapies and residual
derangements prior to transplant. Considerable research on
three main micronutrients emerged in KTR: phosphorous,
magnesium, and vitamin D. Trends in their relationship
to transplantation are listed below and relevant nutrient
information is listed in Table 1.
Phosphorus
Post-transplant patients tend to revert to hypophosphatemia
immediately post-transplant (39) due to several factors including
hyperabsorption from bones, secondary parathyroidism, and
fibroblast growth factor 23 normalization (40). In a study
analyzing over 28,000 phosphate measurements for 957 KTR,
researchers observed the lowest median serum phosphate level
around 1 month post-KT (41). They also found an association
between low phosphate levels and a reduced risk in graft failure
and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, but not all-cause
mortality.
Data from the Folic Acid for Vascular Outcome Reduction
in Transplantation (FAVORIT) trial (42) also investigated longterm KTR phosphorus status and found an increased in
transplant failure and total mortality but not CVD (HR: 1.36,
95% CI 1.15–1.62, HR: 1.21, 95% CI 1.04–1.4, and HR 1.06, 95%
CI 0.92–1.22, respectively). Two recent studies showed elevated
serum phosphorus was associated with KTR mortality and graft
loss (43, 44). Conversely, there are studies that do not find
correlations or increased risk with serum phosphorus and graft
outcomes (45).
Magnesium
Magnesium (Mg) deficiency is common but often undiagnosed
in KTR due to physiological regulation. The surge of calcineurin
inhibitors (CNI) use increases magnesium wasting through
down regulating the Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin 6
(TRPM6) in the distal collecting tubule (46, 47). In large cohort
(48) and meta-analysis studies (49–52), hypomagnesaemia
and poor Mg dietary intake are associated with T2DM in
non-KTR. This is observation has been explored through
randomized controlled trials (RCTs), yet outcomes do not fully
support the hypothesis the supplementation impacts glucose
homeostasis.
Some supplementation studies have been poorly tolerated,
underpowered, or showed minimal increase in Mg serum status.
A recent study supplemented hypomagnesaemic KTRs within 2
weeks of transplantation for 3 months and compared glucose

homeostasis to a control group (53). This study showed an
11.5 mg/dL improvement in fasting glucose but no difference
in insulin sensitivity. Mg supplementation (450 mg magnesium
oxide, three times daily for 6 months) on hypomagnesaemic
KTRs often does not demonstrate any change in insulin secretion
(54–56).
Vitamin D
Inadequate or deficient vitamin D status is common in
KTR compared to non-transplant controls (57) irrespective
of sun exposure seasons (58). Vitamin D has been
linked to several post-transplant comorbidities including
polyoma virsus, acute rejection, and diabetes, yet there
is evidence of providing a reno-protective effect as
well (59).
DISCUSSION
The lack of dietary intake is a limitation among the majority
of research studies investigating nutrient roles in kidney
transplantation. In 1990, a group of 66 renal dietitians were
surveyed to indicate nutrition recommendations for patients
up to 21-days post-transplant (60). Dietary recommendations
focused on normalizing nitrogen balance and minimizing
diabetes and hyperlipidemia. Suggested macronutrient profiles

Nolte Fong and Moore Nutiriton Considerations for Kidney Transplant Recipients
included protein at 1.2–1.5 g/kg body weight, carbohydrates
40–50% of total energy, and fat <30% of total energy.
Current Dietary Trends
Few studies investigate dietary intakes and trends of KTR,
especially longitudinally. The onset of NODAT within the first 6
months post-KT often occurs (61), therefore, early monitoring
and intervention of dietary behavior could be very beneficial
in combating post-KT comorbidities. In a cohort of 31 KTR,
dietary recalls pre-KT and at 3 and 12 months post-transplant
revealed different intakes at each time point, with the highest
total energy, total fat, and saturated fat consumption at 3 months
(62). Mean dietary fat increased 26 g/d (p = 0.01) and 18.3 g/d
(p = 0.02) at 3 and 12 months compared to pre-KT. On the other
hand, a prospective analysis of dietary intake by 24 h recalls of
44 KTR, showed no significant difference in intake between time
of transplant and 3 and 6 months post-KT (63). Mean total fat
provided ∼37% of energy intake, CHO 44%, and protein 18%.
In a study investigating dietary patterns with a mean
transplant duration of 5.6 years (n = 637), macronutrient profiles
were 36% fat, 15% protein, and 45.8% carbohydrates (23), which
are similar to the Dietary Guidelines discussed in previous
sections.
In a dietary analysis of 632 Dutch KTR, the Dietary Approach
to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score was calculated through food
frequency questionnaires administered over 5 years (64). The
highest tertile of DASH scores had more than a 50% reduction
in both renal function decline (HR = 0.57; 95% CI, 0.33–0.96,
P = 0.03) and all-cause mortality (HR = 0.52; 95% CI, 0.32–0.83,
P = 0.006) when compared to the lowest group after controlling
for age, kidney function, transplant characteristics, and sex.
In another trial comprised of two groups, Group 1 had insulin
resistance or NODAT (n = 36) and received active lifestyle
counseling, and Group 2 had normal glucose tolerance (n = 79)
and only received leaflets on health behavior (65). Group 1
experienced a reduction in NODAT (n = 7 vs. n = 3) while Group
2 experienced an increase in the number of participants who were
glucose intolerant (n = 12). This study demonstrated that active
lifestyle modification reversed insulin resistance compared to a
passive approach.
Dietary Intervention Studies in Kidney
Transplantation
Protocols that are underway or planned reveal strategies
to investigate dietary and lifestyle interventions in KTR.
A randomized controlled trial in Brittan is investigating
the difference of active vs. passive lifestyle intervention on
cardiometabolic outcomes of KTR (66). Similarly, the INTENT
trial (67) randomizes patients at least 1-month post-KT to either
standard of care or frequent visits of motivational interviewing
techniques with a dietitian and exercise physiologist for 12
months. The Active Care after Transplantation trial (68) plans
to enroll 216 KTR and randomize participants into one of three
groups: standard of care, exercise only intervention, and diet plus
exercise therapies for over 15 months.
Prior to these studies, very few RCT on dietary intervention
have been conducted (69) and non-randomized trials showed
mixed degrees of weight loss and impact on outcomes (65, 70, 71).
Dietary Recommendations
Dietary recommendations are scarce for the post-KT community
with most major international regulatory and advisory
committees excluding this important aspect in clinical care
guidelines. Dietary recommendations should be given with the
intent to reduce comorbidities and micronutrient deficiencies.
With few RCTs, it proves difficult to provide recommendations
other than a targeted, individualistic approach. Many established
diets including the DASH diet and Mediterranean diets are
suitable for KTR, however, no longitudinal studies have
been conducted in this population to date. Many factors in
addition to lifestyle change and food preferences must be
considered, namely immunosuppression regimens and postoperative course (i.e., recurrent infections or poor wound
healing).
CONCLUSION
Dietary patterns change over time and monitoring risk factors for
developing metabolic complications post-transplant should be a
clinical priority. Post-transplant weight gain, particularly visceral
fat gain, increases the risk of developing NODAT, dyslipidemia,
and CVD. Higher quality research studies, namely randomized
controlled trials, are needed to properly develop guidelines
and implement clinical protocols to prevent malnutrition posttransplant.
