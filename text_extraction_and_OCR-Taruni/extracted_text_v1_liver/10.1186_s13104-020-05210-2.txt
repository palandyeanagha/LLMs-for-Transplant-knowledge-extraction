alfa in pleural space infection with once daily 
concurrent administration: a retrospective 
cohort study

Abstract
Objective: The use of intrapleural tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and dornase alfa (DNase) is common in the 
management of pleural space infection. We review our experience with the efcacy and safety of this therapy. We 
performed a single center, retrospective study of consecutive patients with complicated parapneumonic efusion or 
empyema who received tPA/DNase therapy. Treatment success was defned as radiographic and clinical improvement 
in pleural space infection that precluded the need for surgical intervention, and the absence of mortality related to 
pleural infection.
Results: Fifty-six patients received concurrent once daily tPA/DNase therapy (median 3 days) from July 2014 to July 
2019. Fifty-two patients (92.9%) had treatment success. Median duration of chest tube therapy was 10 days and 
length of stay was 15 days. Signifcant pleural bleeding requiring transfusion therapy occurred in fve patients (8.9%). 
Of these, three patients (5.4%) required operative intervention. Concurrent once daily administration of tPA/DNase 
in patients with pleural infection yielded comparable rates of treatment success as compared to twice daily concurrent or sequential administration. However, adverse events highlight potential safety concerns with using once daily 
concurrent administration of tPA/DNAse.

Introduction
Empyema and complicated parapneumonic efusions 
(CPE) are estimated to cost the United States healthcare system at least 500 million dollars a year [1] and 
the former is associated with a mortality of at least 15% 
[2]. Fibrinolytic therapy for intrapleural infections has 
been available since 1949, when it was initially described 
by Tillet and Sherry, as a therapy to facilitate improved 
drainage of infected pleural efusions [3].
Te use of intrapleural alteplase (tPA) and dornase 
alfa (DNase) in the management of complicated parapneumonic efusions and empyema was demonstrated to 
improve chest tube drainage, reduce the requirement for 
thoracic surgical intervention, and reduce hospital length 
of stay as compared to placebo and alteplase use alone 
[4].
Intrapleural hemorrhage requiring blood transfusion 
was observed in 3.8% of the patients receiving combination therapy [4]. In a “real world” study, pleural bleeding

requiring blood transfusion also occurred at a similar 
1.8% rate [5]. At our institution, we utilized a once daily 
concurrent administration technique and experienced 
good clinical efcacy. However, we observed a higher rate 
of signifcant pleural bleeding as compared to the above 
studies.
Main text
Methods
We reviewed the charts of all patients admitted to our 
hospital with complicated parapneumonic efusion or 
empyema from January 1, 2014 to July 1, 2019. Patients 
were identifed using ICD codes and pharmacy records. 
Patients were included if there was: (1) a complicated parapneumonic efusion defned by a non-purulent efusion 
in a patient with pleural fuid pH less than or equal to 7.2, 
pleural fuid glucose less than 60 mg/dL, pleural fuid lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) greater than 1000 IU/L, and/
or radiographic evidence of loculations; or (2) empyema 
defned by purulent pleural fuid or microbiological identifcation within the fuid [6].
Te dose of DNase (Pulmozyme; Genetech, South San 
Francisco, CA) was 5  mg in 30  mL of sterile water and 
the dose of tPA (Activase; Genetech, South San Francisco, CA) was 10  mg in 10  mL of 0.9% NaCl. Concurrent administration (i.e. injection of tPA followed by 
DNase one after the other) of these agents was followed 
by a 10 mL saline fush. Te chest tube was clamped for 
60  min before it was opened to a gravity bag. Routine 
therapy was given once daily. Te total number of days 
of administration was at the discretion of the treating 
physician.
In contrast, the sequential administration method 
refers to: (1) the administration of tPA followed by a 10- 
to 25-mL fush of saline followed by a 60 min clamp, (2) 
an unclamp followed by a 60 min open drainage period, 
(3) the administration of DNase followed by a 10- to 
25-mL fush of saline followed by another 60 min clamp, 
and (4) an unclamp to open drainage.
Electronic medical records were reviewed for patient 
demographics, clinical characteristics, treatment, outcomes, and safety. Te primary efcacy outcome was 
treatment success, which was defned as clinical and 
radiologic improvement without the need for surgical intervention or mortality. Clinical and radiographic 
improvement were assessed by documentation by the 
treating physician. Radiographic improvement was 
defned as signifcant improvement of the opacifed 
hemithorax on chest x-ray. Other clinical outcome measures included need for operative intervention for treatment failure, need for operative intervention for pleural 
bleeding complications, mortality related to pleural 
infection or bleeding complications, cumulative volume 
of pleural fuid drainage, length of chest tube therapy, and 
length of hospital stay.
Incidence of major bleeding was defned according to 
the International Society of Trombosis and Haemostasis 
[7] as (1) Fatal bleeding, and/or (2) Symptomatic bleeding in a critical organ such as intracranial, intraspinal, 
intraocular, retroperitoneal, intraarticular, intrathoracic, 
pericardial, or intramuscular with compartment syndrome, and/or (3) Bleeding causing a fall of hemoglobin 
of 2 g/dL or more leading to a transfusion of two or more 
units of packed red blood cells (pRBC).
Further, we defned “pleural bleeding” as a change in 
chest tube drainage to a bloody appearance accompanied 
by signs and symptoms of bleeding (i.e. worsening respiratory symptoms, incident pleuritic chest pain, worsening radiographic appearance, and/or decrease in serum 
hemoglobin values). Evidence of pleural bleeding found 
during surgery was also considered “pleural bleeding.”
Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft 
Excel. Descriptive statistics for continuous data are 
expressed as mean (standard deviation [SD]) if normally 
distributed and as median (interquartile range [IQR]) if 
non-normally distributed; for categorical data statistics 
are expressed as N (%). Te study was approved by the 
Jamaica Hospital Medical Center Institutional Review 
Board (IRB# 1527223).
Results
Patients
Our study included 56 patients with CPE or empyema who received concurrent tPA/DNase therapy. All 
patients meeting inclusion criteria during the defned 
time period were included. Complete data was available 
for all patients. Te baseline demographics and pre-existing medical conditions of these patients are outlined in 
Table 1. Te mean age was 64.8 (±16.2) years with 64.2% 
being male. Twenty-one patients (37.5%) were on an antiplatelet agent or anticoagulant. Only fve (8.9%) were on 
full dose anticoagulation for a pre-existing indication.
Clinical, radiographic, microbiological, and treatment 
data are shown in Table 2. Evidence of loculations on CT 
chest imaging were noted in 78.6% of the patients. Purulence of pleural fuid was noted in 30.4% of patients and 
46.4% of the sampled efusions yielded a positive bacterial culture. Te predominant microorganisms isolated 
were Streptococcus milleri (n=8) and Staphylococcus 
aureus (n=9; methicillin sensitive, n=5; methicillin 
resistant n=4). Te majority of patients received three or 
fewer doses of tPA/DNase (92%). Te reasons for using 
fewer than three doses varied on a case by case basis, 
including rapid resolution of clinical and radiographic 
features (n=6), patient refusal due to intractable chest 
pain (n=3), and change in hemodynamics (n=2).

Outcomes
Outcome data is presented in Table 3. Fifty-two out of 
ffty-six (92.9%) of the patients experienced treatment 
success. Te median number of days from chest tube 
insertion to frst dose of intrapleural treatment was 
1 day (IQR, 0–2) with 66.1% receiving the frst dose of 
intrapleural tPA/DNase within 24 h. Te median chest 
tube outputs at 24  h and 72  h after intrapleural therapy were 447.5  mL (IQR, 177.5–769.8) and 1470  mL 
(IQR, 717.5–1989.8), respectively. Median chest tube 
duration was 10 days (IQR, 7–14) and median hospital 
length of stay was 15 days (IQR, 11–28).
Four patients (7.1%) experienced treatment failure, 2 of which received surgical intervention. Tese 
two patients underwent video assisted thoracoscopic 
surgery (VATS) with decortication and both were successfully discharged and survived beyond 30 days. Te 
other two patients with treatment failure had refractory septic shock and were not considered operative 
candidates.
Adverse events
Nine patients (16.1%) experienced pleural bleeding as 
defned in “Methods” section. Of these, only fve (8.9% 
of all patients) developed pleural bleeding signifcant 
enough to require transfusion of at least 2 units of pRBC. 
Tree of these fve patients (5.4% of all patients) required 
surgical intervention with VATS for evacuation of hematoma. No patients experienced major bleeding at any 
other predefned sites.
All nine patients who experienced pleural bleeding 
received three or more doses of tPA/DNase. Mean hemoglobin loss was 3.5 g/dL (±1.1) and the median units of 
pRBC transfusions was 2 units (IQR 2–5). Tere was no 
mortality related to pleural bleeding at 30  days. Of the 
fve patients requiring ≥2 units of pRBC, one was on 
full dose anticoagulation (rivaroxaban), which was held 
for 2 days prior to chest tube insertion but was resumed 
during the time this patient received fbrinolytic therapy. 
Tree patients were on aspirin alone. In comparison, of 
the 47 patients who had no evidence of pleural bleeding 
while receiving tPA/DNase, 21 patients (44.7%) were on 
some form of antiplatelet agent or an anticoagulant (12 
patients on aspirin alone, 4 patients on aspirin and clopidogrel, 1 patient on rivaroxaban, 1 patient on apixaban, 1 
patient on enoxaparin, and 1 patient on warfarin).
Te 30-day mortality rate due to pleural infection 
was 3.6% (2 out of 56 patients). Tese two patients both 
received three doses of tPA/DNase and passed away at 
days 14 and 27. Both were in the intensive care unit setting with septic shock due to empyema and acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation.
Discussion
Empyema and CPE are associated with signifcant morbidity and mortality [1, 2, 8]. Intrapleural administration of tPA (with or without DNase) at 10 mg has been 
reported to lead to pleural bleeding at rates between 1.8 
and 12.0% [5, 9–13]. Based on one pharmacologic study, 
the bleeding risk of intrapleural tPA appears to be dose 
dependent [13].
Te MIST-2 trial [4], which utilized 10 mg of alteplase 
and 5  mg of dornase alfa twice daily, demonstrated a 
3.8% rate of pleural bleeding. However, a retrospective 
study using the same dosing regimen [13], led to a pleural bleeding rate of 5.4%. Tere is conficting data as to 
whether reducing the dose of tPA will lead to a reduction 
in pleural bleeding [14, 15].

Conversely, a study utilizing extended tPA/DNase dosing (mean 9.8 doses) in patients who were not surgical 
candidates, demonstrated a similar efcacy rate as six 
doses but a higher pleural bleeding rate at 10% [16]. Two 
studies investigated the efect of concurrent administration of tPA and DNase. One study showed comparable 
treatment success rates but an increased rate in pleural 
bleeding as compared to MIST-2 [13]. Te other showed 
treatment success comparable to MIST-2 trial but with 
no pleural bleeding [15].
Our data shows that a concurrent once daily dosing 
strategy was associated with a similar rate of treatment 
success as previous studies that utilized a twice daily, 
sequential dosing strategy. Rates of treatment failure 
requiring VATS decortication in our cohort (5.4%) were 
comparable to the rates found in previous studies of 4.0 
to 9.6% [4, 5, 13]. Given apparent similarities in the clinical and biochemical characteristics of our patient cohort 
in comparison to these other studies, it is reasonable to 
conclude that a once daily concurrent dosing regimen is 
as efective as twice daily concurrent dosing.
Although our treatment success rate was comparable to that of previously reported studies, our patients 
experienced a longer duration of chest tube therapy 
and length of hospital stay compared to prior studies. 
Tis raises the possibility that the reduced dosing or 
the concurrent administration of medications leads to 
a longer duration of drainage time before completion 
of therapy. Alternatively, this could refect variations in 
local treatment practices or the absence of rigid protocols of a clinical trial setting that may have led to earlier 
removal of chest tubes.
Despite using a lower total dose of alteplase, our 
study revealed an overall pleural bleeding rate of 16.1%. 
Te rate of pleural bleeding requiring at least 2 units 
of pRBC was 8.9% (5 patients). Tree patients (5.4%) 
required VATS for hematoma evacuation. Tis stands 
in contrast to previous studies which showed overall 
rates of pleural bleeding ranging from 0 to 5.4% and no 
reports of pleural bleeding requiring VATS for hematoma evacuation [4, 5, 9, 13, 15, 16]. Te use of antiplatelet or anticoagulant medications may have led to 
the increased bleeding rate. Further, we speculate there 
may be a synergistic efect of concurrent administration 

Jiang et al. BMC Res Notes (2020) 13:368 Page 5 of 6
of tPA/DNase leading to the increased pleural bleeding 
rate.
Conclusion
In this single center, retrospective study of patients presenting with complicated parapneumonic efusion or 
empyema, the use of once daily concurrently administered tPA/DNAse led to comparable rates of the primary 
efcacy outcome of treatment success as prior studies 
utilizing twice daily concurrent or sequential dosing.
Limitations
• Tis retrospective design and relatively small sample 
size limits defnitive conclusions.
• A component of our defnition of clinical success 
included physician assessment, which is subjective in 
nature.
• Assessment of radiographic improvement was based 
on radiologist interpretation and not by objective 
quantitative means, such as CT volumetry.
