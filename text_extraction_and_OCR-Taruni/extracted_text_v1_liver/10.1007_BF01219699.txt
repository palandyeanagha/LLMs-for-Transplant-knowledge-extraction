Summary. Adult rat islets harvested by the collagenase digestion/Ficoll separation technique were injected into the splenic pulp in 9 syngeneic (Lewis- 
-->Lewis and WaG-~WaG) and 13 allogeneic [(DA 
X Lewis) Fl--~Lewis] experiments. Normal serum 
glucose levels and 24 hour urine volumes were restored in all 9 syngeneic recipients and in 11 out of 
the 13 allogeneic recipients in a mean of 3.3 days. 
Splenectomy performed on 3 of the 9 syngeneic recipients 110-178 days after transplantation resulted 
in a prompt return to the diabetic state. In all the 
remaining syngeneic recipients, normal values have 
persisted for the current period of observation of 6 
months. In 5 untreated allogeneic recipients, rejection occurred in a mean of 5.2 days. The administration of a short course of ALS (1 ml I. P. days - 1, 1, 
3 and 5) to the remaining 6 animals greatly prolonged graft survival with all animals remaining normoglycaemic for at least 4 weeks. These results were 
not significantly different from those recorded in 
comparable groups of intra-portal allogeneic islet 
recipients. 
Key words: Pancreatic Islets, transplantation, 
spleen, rejection, normoglycaemia. 
The results of human whole or segmental pancreatic 
transplantation remain disappointing. Although 51 
such transplants have been performed throughout 
the world to date, only one patient is at present alive

and with a functioning graft [1]. In contrast, the 
early results of experimental free islet cell transplantation have been more encouraging. Reversal of experimentally induced diabetes in animals has been 
achieved by implanting islet tissue into a variety of 
sites, including the peritoneal cavity [2, 3, 4, 5], the 
portal vein [6, 7, 8, 9 10], beneath the renal capsule 
[11], and at the root of the mesentery [9]. However, 
only the intra-portal method of administration has 
consistently resulted in the permanent restoration of 
normoglycaemia. Unfortunately the liver carries the 
inherent disadvantage that it is a vital organ and, as 
such, cannot be removed if problems arise following 
transplantation and, indeed, we have recently drawn 
attention to the possible association between longterm successful intra-portal transplantation and the 
development of multiple biliary cysts of the liver 
[12]. It is thus possible that this site will be unsuitable for clinical use. 
The spleen, on the other hand, is not a vital organ and can be removed without seriously endangering the patient's life. Like the pancreas it possesses a portal venous drainage and, as with the liver, it 
is a highly vascular organ and likely to provide a 
similar environment for the successful nutrition of 
implanted islet tissue. Furthermore, it should be 
possible in clinical practice to implant tissue into the 
spleen by transfemoral catheterisation of the splenic 
artery thus avoiding the need for laparotomy under 
general anaesthesia - a procedure that could be repeated many times as more islets became available 
from culture, cytopreservation, or multiple donors. 
We have therefore studied the effect of transplantation of isolated islet tissue into the splenic 
pulp in both syngeneic and allogeneic strain combinations, and compared the results of allogeneic 
transplants with those obtained with the intra-portal 
method of administration.

Experimental Design 
To study the metabolic effects of the intra-splenic 
transplantation of isolated rat islets without the 
problem of immunological rejection, 600-800 adult 
islets were implanted into the splenic pulp of streptozotocin-diabetic syngeneic recipients in 9 consecutive experiments (3 Lewis---~Lewis, 6 WaG---~WaG). 
In a further 23 transplant experiments performed to 
study the effect of the rejection response on islets 
situated in the spleen compared with those in the 
liver, allogeneic islets from (DA X Lewis) F1 donors 
were transplanted into Lewis recipients. In 13 recipients, the islets were transplanted into the splenic 
pulp and in the remaining 10 animals were injected 
into the portal vein. To compare the ease with which 
the rejection response could be modified by immunosuppression, half of the successful transplant 
recipients in each group were treated with a short 
course of rabbit anti-rat lymphocyte serum (1 ml 
I. P. days -l, 1, 3, and 5), the remaining animals in 
each group receiving no form of immunosuppression 
and acting as controls. 
Splenectomy was performed on 3 of the 9 
syngeneic recipients 110-180 d after transplantation 
to study the histological appearance of the transplanted islets and the metabolic effects of graft 
removal. 
Materials and Methods 
Rats 
All rats were virgin females between 12 and 16 
weeks old and weighed between 150 and 225 g. Da 
(AgB4), Lewis (AgB 1) and the (DA X Lewis) F1 
Hybrid were bred and reared in the animal house of 
the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford. WaG (AgB 2) rats 
were supplied by Bantin and Kingman Ltd. of East 
Grimston, Yorkshire. 
Induction of Diabetes 
Diabetes was induced in recipients by the intravenous injection of streptozotocin (65 mg/kg body 
weight) given into a tail vein. Only those animals 
with non-fasting serum glucose levels > 400 rag/100 
ml and 24 h urine volumes of > 50 ml on two consecutive occasions at least ten days after injection 
were considered to have established diabetes for the 
purposes of these experiments. 
Islet Isolation and Transplantation 
Islets were isolated by a modification of the Collagenase digestion/Ficoll separation technique [2]. 
This has previously been described in detail [10]. 
D. R. A. Finch et al.: Splenic Transplantation of Islets 
The abdominal cavity of intra-portal recipients 
was opened under ether anaesthesia and the islets, 
suspended in 1 ml of Hanks solution in a Iml disposable syringe, were injected into the portal vein 
through a 25 FG needle. Repeated aspiration and 
injection of small quantities of portal blood was 
necessary to transfer all islets from the syringe into 
the vessel. 
For intra splenic recipients, the islets were suspended in 150 gl of Hanks solution and aspirated 
into a 250 gl Hamilton's syringe into which a bolus 
of 100 gl of Hanks solution had previously been 
drawn. The needle of the syringe was passed 
through the length of the pulp space of the spleen in 
the long axis of the gland, and the islets slowly injected as the needle was withdrawn - the 100 gl of 
Hanks solution ensuring transfer of all islets out of 
the dead space of the needle. 
Post Transplantation Measurements 
Following transplantation all animals were confined 
to individual metabolic cages and allowed free access to food and water. Blood samples were obtained by amputating the tip of the tail. Non-fasting 
serum glucose levels, 24 h urine volumes, urine glucose and body weights were recorded daily for the 
first 14 d, on alternate days from 16-40 d, and less 
frequently thereafter. Serum glucose estimations 
were performed on an Analox GMT4 Glucose analyser (Analox Instruments Ltd., Oxford). Urinary 
glucose was estimated with Clinistix (Ames Co., 
Slough). 
Anti-Lymphocyte Serum 
Rabbit anti-rat lymphocyte serum was prepared in a 
single batch in our laboratory by the intraperitoneal 
injection of 108 rat thoracic duct lymphocytes on 
three occasions at weekly intervals into an adult rabbit. The serum was collected at weekly intervals 
over the next seven weeks and pooled. A further 
booster dose of 1() s lymphocytes was given at the 
end of the fourth week of collection. The serum was 
stored in 1 ml aliquots at -40 ~ 
Each recipient received 1 ml of ALS intraperitoneally 24 h before transplantation, and a 
similar volume was given on the first, third and fifth 
days after transplantation. 
Results

Of the 9 syngeneic intra splenic recipients, 6 were 
normoglycaemic within the first three days of transplantation, and the remaining three became nor-

moglycaemic on the 4th, 5th and l lth days. 
Splenectomy was performed on three recipients 110, 
165, and 178 d after transplantation with a return of 
the diabetic state (serum glucose > 400 mg/100 ml) 
in all three animals within 24 h. Histological study 
of the spleen excised at 110 d showed well granulated beta cells lying within the splenic pulp along 
the implantation tract (Fig. 1). All remaining animals have remained normoglycaemic with normal 
24 h urine volumes and in good health for the current period of observation (6 months) (Table 1). 
2. Allogeneic Intra-Splenic and Intra-Portal 
Recipients (Table 2). 
In two of the 13 intra-splenie recipients normoglycaemia was not reached before rejection occurred. The results of the 11 successful intra-splenic 
transplants and of 10 intra-portal allogeneic transplants in the same donor-recipient strain cOmbination are shown in Table 2. 
Rejection of intra-splenic islets in recipients not 
receiving immunosuppression occurred in a mean of 
5.4 d compared with 4.8 d when the intra-portal 
route of administration was used. There is no significant difference between these two values (p > 
0.05). 
The addition of a short course of anti-lymphocyte serum greatly prolonged the survival of intrasplenic islets with all recipients remaining normoglycaemic for at least 4 weeks. Administration of 
ALS to intra-portal recipients produced a wider 
range of results (20 - > 100 d) but these results 
were not significantly different from those obtained 
in the intra-splenic group (p > 0.05). 
Discussion 
Previous reported attempts to correct streptozotocin 
induced diabetes in experimental animals by the intra-splenic transplantation of islet tissue have met 
with only limited success. Ziegler et al. [13] transplanted both fetal pancreata and isolated adult islets 
under the splenic capsule of syngeneic recipients 
without success. Colin and Baillat [14] demonstrated 
significant but incomplete regression of diabetes by 
the administration of isolated adult islets into the 
splenic pulp of recipients of the same inbred strain, 
although subsequent transplants by this group have

been more successful [15]. More recently Koncz et 
al. [16] have also produced amelioration of the 
diabetic state, but failed to produce normoglycaemia. Using similar techniques we have consistently achieved restoration of normoglycaemia. The 
failure of other workers to obtain similar results may 
have been due to the difficulty experienced in transferring all the islets harvested into the splenic pulp. 
In two preliminary experiments, not reported in this 
series, we attempted to implant islets into the spleen 
using the standard 1 ml disposable syringe and needle which had proved entirely satisfactory for intraportal administration. However, when used for intrasplenic implantation it was obvious that a large 
number of islets were remaining in the dea~tspace of 
the needle. These two animals did not become normoglycaemic until 18 and 20 d after transplantation 
and reverted to the diabetic state 67 and 95 d later. 
However, once the complete yield of islets was 
transferred to the splenic pulp by the introduction of 
the technique already described, identical results to 
those seen in syngeneic intra-portal recipients were 
achieved. The demonstration of a prompt return to 
the diabetic state in all three of the syngeneic recipients submitted to splenectomy 110-178 d after 
transplantation suggests that it is unlikely that the 
maintenance of normal values in our long term survivors is due to regeneration of the recipients' own 
islet tissue. Spontaneous recovery from streptozotocin induced diabetes does undoubtedly occasionally 
occur, but in our experience generally manifests itself within the first few weeks of injection. 
Our allogeneic results are particularly encouraging. It has been suggested that the liver may play an 
important role in suppressing immune responses to 
histocompatibility on sheep red cell antigens [17, 
18], and that the intra-hepatic transplantation of 
free endocrine allografts confers upon them an immunological advantage compared to other sites. 
Barker [19] reported prolonged survival of a series 
of intra-portal islet transplants compared with intraperitoneal transplants, and Pfeffermann et al. [20] 
reported significant prolongation of survival of 
parathyroid allografts when placed in the liver compared with the thigh hamstring muscle. However, in 
both series prolonged survival was only seen when 
the tissue was implanted across a minor histocompatibility barrier. In contrast, the implantation of 
antigenic tissue directly into lymphoid tissue might 
be expected to evoke a more rapid rejection process 
which would be more difficult to suppress. Our allogeneic experiments, carried out across a strong 
histocompatibility barrier, have failed to demonstrate any significant difference between intrasplenic and intra-hepatic allograft survival, and islets 
in both sites appear equally susceptible to immunosuppression with ALS. This finding is surprising and at present inexplicable. Local suppression of 
antigen sensitive cells by the high local concentration of antigen, or direct stimulation of suppressor T 
cells, which are present in the spleen in abundance, 
are theoretical explanations. Furthermore as the 
spleen functions as a trap for antigen in the circulation, the placing of islets in the pulp space of the 
spleen rather than intra-arterially might expose the 
islets to a different population of lymphocytes in the 
pulp space to that around arteries. 
Thus the splenic pulp may prove a more suitable 
site for the clinical transplantation of pancreatic free 
grafts than other sites hitherto evaluated. Certainly, 
in experimental animals, results comparable to those 
obtained with the intraportal method of administration can be achieved in both syngeneic and allogeneic recipients.
