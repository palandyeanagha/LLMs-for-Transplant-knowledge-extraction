Abstract
Background: Specialist physician concentration in urban areas can affect access and quality of care for rural
patients. As effective drug treatment for hepatitis C (HCV) becomes increasingly available, the extent to which rural
patients needing HCV specialists face access or quality deficits is unknown. We sought to determine the influence of
rural residency on access to HCV specialists and quality of liver care.
Methods: The study used a national cohort of 151,965 Veterans Health Administration (VHA) patients with HCV
starting in 2005 and followed to 2009. The VHA’s constant national benefit structure reduces the impact of insurance
as an explanation for observed disparities. Multivariate cox proportion regression models for each quality indicator
were performed.
Results: Thirty percent of VHA patients with HCV reside in rural and highly rural areas. Compared to urban
residents, highly rural (HR 0.70, CI 0.65-0.75) and rural (HR 0.96, CI 0.94-0.97) residents were significantly less likely
to access HCV specialty care. The quality indicators were more mixed. While rural residents were less likely to
receive HIV screening, there were no significant differences in hepatitis vaccinations, endoscopic variceal and
hepatocellular carcinoma screening between the geographic subgroups. Of note, highly rural (HR 1.31, CI 1.14-1.50)
and rural residents (HR 1.06, CI 1.02-1.10) were more likely to receive HCV therapy. Of those treated for HCV, a
third received therapy from a non-specialist provider.
Conclusion: Rural patients have less access to HCV specialists, but this does not necessarily translate to quality
deficits. The VHA's efforts to improve specialty care access, rural patient behavior and decentralization of HCV
therapy beyond specialty providers may explain this contradiction. Lessons learned within the VHA are critical for US
healthcare systems restructuring into accountable care organizations that acquire features of integrated systems.

Introduction
Geography has long been recognized as an access to care
barrier. This problem is perhaps most apparent in those
needing care from specialist physicians. Specialists are even
more likely than generalists to live and work in urban
environments[1]. Yet some therapies, such as mental health,
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment and cancer
care, that have good evidentiary support for their effect on
health, require specialist participation, placing rural-residing
patients at a potential access deficit[2,3]. This maldistribution
has been postulated as one reason for observed urban-rural
disparities in specialist utilization and health related quality of
life[1,4]. Geography is not the only reason that rural residents
might have impaired access to specialty care or quality deficits,
however. Rural residents are also more likely to be uninsured
or publicly insured [5].

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) presents an
excellent test system for disentangling these two possible
mechanisms for the observed effects of rurality on specialist
care. VHA has a constant national benefits structure, making
access to care differences due to insurance less likely. VHA
specialists, like their non-VHA counterparts, are concentrated
in urban areas. VHA specialists typically work in central,
usually urban, locations termed Veteran Affairs Medical
Centers (VAMCs) and are the specialty referral reservoir for
outlying primary care clinics, known as community based
outpatient clinics (CBOCs). For example, the San Francisco
Veterans Affairs Medical Center (SFVAMC) is the specialty
care center for four CBOCs located 6, 60, 115 and 270 miles
away. Some previous research has found that health-related
quality of life may lag in rural veterans as it does in
nonveterans, and that they may suffer delays in accessing
specialty mental health and HIV care [3,4,6-10].
HCV provides an excellent disease model for examining the
impact of rurality on specialty care access. HCV treatment
regimens are increasingly effective in eradicating viremia, but
are complex to manage, fraught with side effects, and require
substantial specialist input [11,12]. With more than 5% of
veterans chronically HCV-infected, four-fold more than the
general United States (US) population, the VHA is the largest
single provider of medical care to people with HCV in the US
[13,14]. Without treatment, 30-40% of patients with chronic
viremia eventually develop cirrhosis[15,16]. The prevalence of
HCV-infected patients with cirrhosis and related sequelae is
rising over the past decade, including rising hospitalization
rates and an eight-fold increase in hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) cases, a malignancy which typically develops in the
setting of cirrhosis[17-19]. Studies conducted within VHA and
other healthcare systems find that patients with HCV who have
not received a gastroenterology (GI) or hepatology visit are
less likely to receive HCV therapy and quality liver care, such
as hepatitis A and B vaccinations[20-23]. However, rural
populations with HCV-associated chronic liver disease have
not generally been included in these studies.
We sought to determine the influence of rural residency on
access to HCV specialists and quality of HCV care. We
hypothesized that rural veterans would be less likely to access
care, receive vaccinations, HIV screening, treatment and
cirrhosis management.
Methods
Data Sources
We created a national, geo-coded, cohort that contains
151,965 VHA patients with confirmed HCV viremia identified in
2005 and followed to 2009. We used the VHA’s HCV Clinical
Case Registry (HCV-CCR) - a national dataset of HCV viremic
confirmed Veterans. The HCV-CCR data elements include
demographics as well as outpatient and inpatient pharmacy
data, laboratory data, diagnoses and procedure codes. The
HCV-CCR was merged with the Planning Systems Support
Group (PSSG) geo-coded file containing urban, rural or highly
rural categorization of patient residence [24]. Urban residents
are defined as anyone living in a US Census defined urbanized
area. Rural residents include anyone not defined as urban.
Highly rural residents live in counties with average population
density of fewer than 7 civilians per square mile. In addition,
these PSSG files include each enrollee’s distance and travel
times to reach the nearest VA facilities that provide primary,
secondary, and tertiary care. Distance and travel time
calculations are sophisticated and considerations include
vehicular approach to the facility, vehicular ferries, toll roads
and U-turns. We further narrowed our cohort to patients who
rely upon the VHA for their regular source of care defined as at
least one VHA family practice, geriatrics, primary care or
women’s clinic visit within a year of cohort entry.
Definition of Outcome Variables
Our primary outcome variables were receipt of a GI or
hepatology visit as well as select indicators of quality liver care
developed and validated within the VHA population[25-27].
These indicators are vaccination for hepatitis A and B, HIV
screening, HCV therapy, and among patients with cirrhosis,
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and endoscopic variceal
screening. Receipt of hepatitis vaccination was defined as
either current procedural terminology (CPT) code for
vaccination or testing for hepatitis A or B immunity followed by
vaccination if found non-immune by searching laboratory
records for test codes and names. We searched laboratory
records for receipt of HIV screening utilizing test indicator
codes. We ascertained receipt of HCV therapy by capturing
pharmacy codes and variations of pharmacy names of
pegylated interferon and ribavirin, standard therapy for HCV at
the time. Among patients with cirrhosis, we identified HCC
screening, occuring one year after diagnosis of cirrhosis, by
searching in radiology files for abdominal imaging (computed
tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or
ultrasound). Among patients with cirrhosis, we considered
receipt of outpatient endoscopic variceal screening, identified
by CPT codes at any time point between 2007 and 2009. We
were broad with this quality categorization as endoscopic
variceal screening did not become guideline-recommended
standard of care until 2007 [28].
Definition of Exposure Variables
Patient residence, distance to care and facility
rurality. Our primary predictor variable was patient residence
subdivided into urban, rural and highly rural. The PSSG data
file was accessed twice, once in 2006 and again in 2008,
during cohort follow-up to capture residence changes. If
residence did change, receipt of quality indicators was tied to
most recent residence. To complement patient residence
categorization, we ascertained distance and travel time in
minutes to the nearest secondary or tertiary care facility,
whichever one was closer. We determined the location of GI or
hepatology care (i.e. VAMC or CBOC) by linking the associated
clinic stop codes with facility codes and names. We identified
the site of HCV therapy by noting the facility of medication
dispensation and location of prescribing provider. We further
categorized facilities as rural or urban to adjust for facility
geography in multivariate modeling described herein.

Patient variables. We captured patient demographics of
age and race/ethnicity (Caucasian, African American, Hispanic
and Unknown). We identified more advanced stages of liver
disease and co-morbid conditions. Cirrhosis was identified by
one inpatient or two outpatient International Classification of
Diseases 9th Revision (ICD-9) diagnostic codes and CPT codes
of cirrhosis or sequelae of end stage liver disease (i.e. ascites,
hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome and variceal
bleed) occurring on different dates[29]. Additional covariates
included medical and psychiatric co-morbidities identified
utilizing the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality ICD-9
codes for cardiac disease, diabetes, HIV co-infection, obesity,
psychiatric disorders, pulmonary disorders, renal failure and
substance use.
Ethics statement
The HCV-CCR was managed by the VHA Center for Quality
Management in Public Health (CQMPH). Request for data
download was reviewed by CQMPH staff and, upon local site
investigator IRB approval, requested data elements are made
available for download in de-identified form with each patient
assigned a national random number identifier. The data was
linked to the PSSG geo-coded file using this random number
identifier. All downloaded data is stored on secured VHA
servers and accessible only to investigators and staff listed in
the approved IRB protocol as well as the CQMPH data request
form. This study was approved by the University of California,
San Francisco (UCSF) Institutional Review Board and the San
Francisco Veterans Affairs Research and Development
Committee. The study was conducted in accordance with the
guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and the principles of
Good Clinical Practice.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical comparisons of means, medians and proportions
of baseline cohort characteristics between urban, rural and
highly rural were calculated using ANOVA and chi-square
tests, respectively. We used cox proportion hazard analysis to
examine the association between geographic region and
receipt of GI/Hepatology clinic visits as well as the
aforementioned liver quality of care indicators. Significant
associations (p≤ 0.05) between patient variables and outcome
variables were evaluated in multivariable models. Patient
residence, the primary predictor of interest, was inserted in all
multivariable models.
We used multivariate cox proportion hazard models to
determine whether geographic distribution, after adjusting for
confounders, significantly predicts liver care utilization and
receipt of quality of care indicators. Proc PHREG was used for
model building following a backward selection approach with
patient geography, facility rurality, race/ethnicity and substance
use forced into all models. Variable p-values >0.15 were not
included in the final model. All analyses were performed using
SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
Results
Patient demographics and receipt of quality live care
Patient residence and distance to care (Table 1). 
Among 151,965 VHA patients with HCV, 30.5% reside in
rural (29.3%) and highly rural (1.2%) areas. Highly rural and
rural residents were more likely to be white and, particularly
among the highly rural sub-group, less likely to have a medical
co-morbid condition. As expected, for all geographic subgroups, rates of cirrhosis rose over the four year follow-up.
While highly rural residents with HCV began the cohort with the
lowest proportion of patients with cirrhosis (5.0%), at the end of
follow-up, the proportion of patients with cirrhosis rose to
12.8% (number of patients with cirrhosis increases by 2.56
times). This rate of rise in patients with cirrhosis is comparable
to rural and urban sub-groups (2.49 and 2.60 respectively).

There is no significant difference in all-cause mortality (13.4%
overall).
Distance and drive time to specialty care was significantly
greater among highly rural and rural veterans with HCV
compared to urban. The median drive time to specialty care
was 155 minutes (IQR 102,219) and 72 (IQR 45, 107) minutes
for highly rural and rural residents, respectively. Median drive
distances to specialty care were significantly greater among

treatment. A portion of HCV treatment was delivered outside
the confines of specialty care as 26.8% of highly rural and
23.3% of rural received therapy from a non-GI/hepatology or

There was no significant difference between rural- and urbanresiding residents in receipt of endoscopic variceal screening
and HCC screening. However, both highly rural (HR 1.30, CI

the geographic groups. Rural residents were significantly less
likely to receive HIV screening.
Discussion
The relationship between access to specialty care and
rurality of patient residence is complex, influenced by patient’s
health status, geography and health system structure. Our
study found lower likelihood of access to GI or hepatology
specialty care among rural and highly residents, consistent with
previous literature and Jarvis’ law which holds that the greater
the distance to care, the less likely it is accessed[30]. However,
a portion of HCV treatment and management is occurring
outside of specialty care clinics and these health system
structural factors appear to improve among rural and highly
rural residents.
Two recent trends are relevant to our work. First, in recent
years, HCV care has been decentralized from specialists in
large urban medical centers to generalists in community
settings[31,32]. Approximately 20% of our cohort received HCV
therapy outside of a GI, hepatology or infectious disease clinic
suggesting that a portion of specialty liver care is delivered
outside of the specialty clinics. Highly rural and rural residents
with HCV were significantly more likely, compared to urban
residents, to access specialty providers that are based within
smaller, predominantly primary care based clinics. This shift
from medical center to community clinic care possibly reflects
the VHA’s broader efforts to disseminate specialty care beyond
larger medical centers. However, it is not clear in our analyses
whether providing HCV therapy through non-specialty clinics is
what accounts for higher treatment rates among highly rural
veterans with HCV.
A second factor that is important to consider in the
interpretation of our results is the influence of health system
structure on access to care. Urban centralization of specialists,
a characteristic of the VHA’s health system structure, could
potentially place distant residing residents at a significant
disadvantage in specialty clinic access. Rural and highly rural
veterans with HCV drive distances nearly 4.6 and 9.7 times
that of urban Veterans with HCV to seek specialty care, an
additional 55 and 138 minutes, respectively. These distances
to specialty care clearly result in reduced access to specialty
clinics, particularly among highly rural residents with cirrhosis
who may be too ill to travel long distances. However, there are
Table 4. Adjusted associations between geographic
residence and receipt of quality liver care.

several important structural elements within the VHA
healthcare system that may mitigate distance related barriers
to specialty clinic access. The VHA staffs the large secondary/
tertiary centers, termed VAMCs, as well as select small,
predominantly primary care staffed clinics, termed CBOCs, with
specialists. To ease the cost associated with travel, the VHA
travel reimbursement program in 2008 increased its
reimbursement rates from 11 cents per mile to 28 cents per
mile resulting in a 10% increase in outpatient visits[33]. The
VHA also provides free shuttle service for veterans with
transportation, particularly distance-related, needs. Veterans
who require an overnight stay due to transportation-related
fatigue or recovery from procedures are provided overnight
hotel-like accommodations. It is possible that these efforts have
reduced the impact of geographic distance on access to
specialty care in the VA.
Our study points to the need for a better conceptualization of
rurality. There is little difference in quality of liver care received
between rural and urban veterans with HCV, possibly a result
of overlapping definitions or highly rural, rural, and urban
residential areas. The lower limit quintiles in distance and time
to specialty care among rural veterans with HCV approximate
the upper limit quintiles of urban veterans with HCV suggesting
that the rural and urban categorization is not robust. In addition
to the lack of clarity in the construct of rurality, we suspect that
the complex findings of our study are a result of diversity in
rural populations. As US topography varies, we can anticipate
that rural populations experience varying degrees of impact of
geography on travel. The PSSG data file, while detail-rich, is
potentially susceptible to pitfalls common to geo-coding
datasets such as capturing variations in travel time due to
traffic. For example, urban-residing veterans may, due to traffic
or the availability of public transportation, experience similar
travel times as their rural-residing counterparts. Finally, as 65%
of highly rural veterans received HCV therapy in urban centers,
this study may also be capturing a phenomenon known as rural
hospital bypass behavior; an effect in which a subset of highly
rural and rural patients who are highly motivated to pursue
therapy will forgo locally available resources to pursue care in
urban-based centers that are potentially perceived as more
specialized [34]. Patterns of specialty care utilization among
rural populations are a complex area that requires further
exploration beyond quantitative analysis.
Lessons learned within the VHA population are critical for US
healthcare systems restructuring into accountable care
organizations that take on many of the features and incentives
of integrated systems. Many US health systems are
encountering a rising demand for specialist level of care in
HCV and other conditions. However, our study suggests that
impaired access to specialty care clinics does not necessarily
translate into across-the-board quality of care deficits. This
raises the possibility that certain aspects of specialty level care
may be occurring outside the purview of specialists without a
significant difference in quality of care delivered. Judicious and
targeted use of expensive specialist management while also
strengthening and expanding the skills of primary care
physician and non-physician providers, may be one of the more
important lessons translated from the VHA system into other

healthcare systems. The policies of integrated systems like the
VHA’s (e.g. shuttle service for geographically isolated veterans,
expansion of video-telemedicine services, staffing specialists
within primary care clinics, etc.) may mitigate quality of care
deficits that could potentially be more striking in other
healthcare systems that have not built as intense specialistgeneralist collaboration structures. Continuing to understand
the interplay between health system structure and patient level
factors (e.g. rurality, comorbidities, income, and education) can
inform models of care that can improve equity and accessibility
of specialty care.
