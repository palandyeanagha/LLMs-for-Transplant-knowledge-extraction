ABSTRACT
Primary biliary cholangitis (formerly known as primary 
biliary cirrhosis, PBC) is an autoimmune liver disease in 
which a cycle of immune mediated biliary epithelial cell 
injury, cholestasis and progressive fibrosis can culminate 
over time in an end-stage biliary cirrhosis. Both genetic 
and environmental influences are presumed relevant to 
disease initiation. PBC is most prevalent in women and 
those over the age of 50, but a spectrum of disease is 
recognised in adult patients globally; male sex, younger 
age at onset (<45) and advanced disease at presentation 
are baseline predictors of poorer outcome. As the disease 
is increasingly diagnosed through the combination 
of cholestatic serum liver tests and the presence of 
antimitochondrial antibodies, most presenting patients 
are not cirrhotic and the term cholangitis is more 
accurate. Disease course is frequently accompanied by 
symptoms that can be burdensome for patients, and 
management of patients with PBC must address, in a 
life-long manner, both disease progression and symptom 
burden. Licensed therapies include ursodeoxycholic 
acid (UDCA) and obeticholic acid (OCA), alongside 
experimental new and re-purposed agents. Disease 
management focuses on initiation of UDCA for all 
patients and risk stratification based on baseline and 
on-treatment factors, including in particular the response 
to treatment. Those intolerant of treatment with UDCA 
or those with high-risk disease as evidenced by UDCA 
treatment failure (frequently reflected in trial and clinical 
practice as an alkaline phosphatase >1.67× upper limit 
of normal and/or elevated bilirubin) should be considered 
for second-line therapy, of which OCA is the only 
currently licensed National Institute for Health and Care 
Excellence recommended agent. Follow-up of patients is 
life-long and must address treatment of the disease and 
management of associated symptoms.
Executive summary
Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is a chronic autoimmune liver disease. It continues to have a burden 
of morbidity and mortality that spans both the 
consequences of a sometimes progressive biliary 
injury, alongside a symptom profile notably encompassing pruritus, sicca complex, fatigue, abdominal 
discomfort and arthralgias/bone pain. UK-PBC and 
the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) have 
partnered to develop a comprehensive guideline 
document to provide detailed advice and recommendations on the best approaches to the management of the disease. A series of recommendations 
and audit standards are proposed to ensure that 
patients are offered timely licensed therapy (ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), obeticholic acid (OCA)) in 
addition to being actively managed for symptoms as 
well as complications of progressive liver disease.
In brief its key recommendations, based on the 
GRADE classification system (Strong/Weak; quality 
of evidence: High/Moderate/Low/Very low), are:
1. The presence of antimitochondrial antibodies 
(>1 in 40) or highly PBC-specific antinuclear antibodies, in the appropriate context of 
cholestatic liver biochemistry, without alternative explanation, is usually sufficient for confidently reaching the diagnosis of PBC (Strong; 
High).
2. All patients with PBC should be offered structured life-long follow-up, recognising that 
different patients have different disease courses and may require different intensity of follow-up (Strong; Moderate).
3. Risk assessment should evaluate disease severity and activity at baseline and on treatment. 
We recommend a combination of serum liver 
tests (to identify those with an elevated bilirubin, a platelet count <150 or biochemical 
disease activity on treatment), imaging (liver 
ultrasound to identify overt cirrhosis and splenomegaly; transient elastography to identify 
increased liver stiffness) and recognition of 
young age at disease onset (<45 years) and 
male sex (Strong; Moderate).
4. To identify those at greatest risk of disease progression, we recommend that all patients have 
individualised risk stratification using biochemical response indices following 1year of 
UDCA therapy (Strong; High). We suggest that 
UDCA treated patients with an alkaline phosphatase (ALP) >1.67 x upper limit of normal 
(ULN) and/or elevated bilirubin <2 x ULN 
represent a group of high-risk patients in 
whom there is randomised controlled trial evidence for the addition of second-line therapy 
(Weak; Moderate).
5. We recommend oral UDCA at 13–15mg/kg/

all patients with PBC. If tolerated, treatment should usually 
be life-long (Strong; High).
6. In patients with inadequate response to UDCA (or UDCA 
intolerance) as defined by ALP >1.67 x ULN and/or elevated bilirubin <2x ULN, the addition of OCA has been 
associated with improvements in biochemical surrogates of 
disease activity reasonably likely to predict improved outcomes. We therefore recommend, in keeping with the NICE 
evaluation of OCA, that the addition of OCA for patients 
with an inadequate response to UDCA, or intolerant of 
UDCA, is considered. We recommend dose adjustment in 
patients with advanced liver disease as per the drug label 
(Strong; Low).
7. We recommend all patients should be evaluated for the presence of symptoms, particularly fatigue and itch. Clinicians 
should recognise that severity of symptoms does not correlate with stage of disease (Strong; Moderate).
8. True overlap with autoimmune hepatitis is probably rare 
and we suggest that, when suspected, liver biopsy with expert clinicopathological review is needed to make the diagnosis and guide treatment (Strong; Moderate).
9. We recommend that patients with PBC should be offered 
the chance to seek support from patient support groups 
(Strong; Moderate).
10. We recommend that clinicians caring for patients with PBC 
should consider introducing clinical audit tools to document and improve the quality of care delivered to patients 
(Strong; Low).
Introduction
Primary biliary cholangitis (formerly known as primary biliary 
cirrhosis, PBC), is a life-long autoimmune cholestatic liver 
disease that is a rare but important cause of chronic liver disease. 
More than 15000 individuals in the UK live with the risks and 
consequences of chronic biliary inflammation. New advances in 
clinical disease understanding have highlighted individual risk, 
and demonstrated the value to patients of approaches to risk 
stratification. At present, care remains predominantly led by 
secondary and tertiary care physicians, who confirm diagnosis, 
initiate therapy and coordinate ongoing follow-up. These guidelines are targeted predominantly towards those gastroenterologists and hepatologists leading the care of patients with PBC. 
However, in addition they will be of value to nurses, primary 
care physicians and those more broadly involved in patient care, 
as well as patients themselves. The guidelines have been developed as a partnership between the BSG and UK-PBC, a Medical 
Research Council (MRC)-funded National Institute for Health 
Research (NIHR) Rare Disease adopted, stratified medicine 
initiative in PBC (www.uk-pbc.com). The guideline development 
has followed the BSG established pathway (http://www.bsg.org.
uk/images/stories/docs/clinical/guidelines/general/bsg_guidelines_advice_document_may2016.pdf),1
 and includes development of a broad membered cholestasis Guidelines Development 
Group, including patient participation.
The impact for patients living with PBC reflects the risk of 
development of advanced cirrhotic and portal hypertensive liver 
disease as well as marked effects on quality of life (QoL) from 
associated symptoms. Treatment is available for patients with 
PBC and some of its symptoms, increasing the importance of 
timely evaluation and diagnosis. Stratification of personal risk 
of complications is emerging and highlights the ‘at-risk’ individuals for whom additional new therapies may ultimately be 
suitable.
Diagnostically, PBC should always be considered in patients 
with otherwise unexplained repeated elevation of usually serum 
alkaline phosphatase (ALP), but also gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT). Autoantibody status should be checked in all such 
patients and the presence of clinically significant antimitochondrial antibody (AMA or anti-M2 ELISA according to local practice) is sufficient to confirm the diagnosis in the absence of biopsy 
in most patients. The presence of specific anti-nuclear-rim, 
anti-nuclear-dot or anti-centromere antibodies (or anti-gp210 
or sp-100 by ELISA) can frequently be sufficient to diagnose 
AMA-negative PBC. True autoantibody-negative disease exists 
and can only be diagnosed on biopsy.
Oral ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) therapy is appropriate for 
all patients at a dose of 13–15mg/kg/day. Crossover features 
suggestive of a potentially corticosteroid-responsive autoimmune hepatitis-type liver injury should be considered in patients 
only after further investigation, usually including a liver biopsy 
and expert hepatopathological review. Inadequate response to 
UDCA (defined using validated criteria) has been robustly associated with increased risk of death or need for liver transplantation. The concept of treatment failure with UDCA is evolving 
and no single risk tool has been identified as ideal; however, 
the concept that the lower the serum ALP value, the better the 
patient outcome is reflected in all tools, alongside other predictive factors such as bilirubin, age and platelet count. Those classified by their clinicians as having an inadequate response to 
UDCA have a clear enhanced risk of liver disease progression, 
and in particular such patients should be subject to long-term 
monitoring for the complications of cirrhosis. At the time of 
writing, although there are numerous risk scores proposed for 
patients with PBC, there is insufficient evidence to recommend 
one over another on the grounds of head-to-head data; each 
stratifier as discussed has, however, been validated. Despite 
this, it should be noted that the ‘Toronto’ biochemical stratification (an ALP value of at least 1.67 times the upper limit 
of the normal (ULN) range and/or an abnormal total bilirubin) 
has been used in clinical trial settings and represents a simple 
and easily applied stratifier of risk for clinicians and patients. 
Second-line therapy in the UK has been licensed and recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the form of obeticholic acid (OCA). Patients 
failing UDCA, or those intolerant of UDCA, therefore now have 
the opportunity to consider (conditionally) licensed therapy 
other than UDCA. In addition, other therapies (repurposed and 
new) continue to also be evaluated.
Given the heightened awareness of poorer outcomes, attention should be given to managing high-risk, younger and UDCA 
non-responsive patients in specialist centres. Deterioration of 
PBC can be rapid in the end stages (particularly once a patient 
is jaundiced) and timely referral for consideration of transplantation, which is an effective treatment for end-stage disease, is 
essential. Recurrence of disease post-transplant is reported, but 
only rarely clinically relevant.
While the majority of patients will have good QoL, for a significant and important minority, impairment is notable and clinicians should enquire specifically about symptoms. Cholestatic 
pruritus affects about a third of patients and effective first-line 
(bile acid sequestrants) and second-line (rifampicin) therapies 
exist, although with tolerability and side effect concerns. Fatigue 
is a significant problem in up to half of patients and is complex 
in nature. Social isolation is an important factor in poor QoL in 
fatigued patients with PBC. There is no single effective therapy 
for fatigue and a structured approach, including effective treatment of comorbid conditions such as pruritus (nocturnal itch

Guideline development process
These guidelines are designed primarily with the hospital physician in mind. They nevertheless underpin the management of 
PBC across all specialities and between primary and hospital 
care. The guidelines have been produced as a consensus document of the BSG Liver Section and UK-PBC with the aim of 
assisting clinicians in the diagnosis and management of patients 
with PBC. The guidelines were initiated by the Liver Section of 
the BSG and approved by the BSG Clinical Services and Standards Committee (CSSC), with internal peer review by the BSG. 
Members of the writing committee included gastroenterologists, hepatologists, transplant physicians, liver pathologists and 
patient representatives. Additional review has been sought from 
experts spanning primary and secondary care, as well as patient 
charities. Where possible, clear, clinically applicable recommendations are provided.
Guidelines Development Group (GDG)
The Guidelines Development Group (which met twice in person 
and regularly by email) had a broad constitution. All members 
declared their conflicts of interest to the BSG prior to guideline writing. Consensus was reached for therapeutic guidance 
where perceived conflicts were possible. Feedback was received 
from the British Liver Trust, LIVErNORTH, Royal College of 
General Practitioners, Nurse Representation (Sam Ducker) and 
the British Association for the Study of the Liver, as well as the 
Liver Section of the BSG. In addition to this, draft guidelines 
were posted on the UK-PBC website for a time limited period 
for open comment.
These guidelines have been produced using a systematic review 
of publications identified using PubMed, Medline and Cochrane 
database searches in line with the Appraisal of Guidelines 
Research & Evaluation (AGREE) instrument II (www.agreetrust.
org). The primary keywords for baseline searches (completed 
in June 2017) were ‘primary biliary cirrhosis’, ‘primary biliary 
cholangitis’ and 'autoimmune overlap syndrome’. Additional 
keywords were included for specific searches such as ‘therapy’ 
and ‘ursodeoxycholic acid’.
Evidence levels (as per Grading of Recommendations, 
Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) system)
The recommendations are based on the GRADE classification 
system (Strong/Weak; quality of evidence: High/Moderate/Low/
Very low).
GRADE classifies recommendations as strong or weak. 
Strength of recommendation is determined by the balance 
between desirable and undesirable consequences of alternative management strategies, quality of evidence, variability in 
values and preferences, and resource use. The larger the difference between the desirable and undesirable effects, the higher 
the likelihood that a strong recommendation is warranted. 
The narrower the gradient, the higher the likelihood that a 
weak recommendation is warranted. The higher the quality of 
evidence, the higher the likelihood that a strong recommendation is warranted. The more values and preferences vary, or the 
greater the uncertainty in values and preferences, the higher the 
likelihood that a weak recommendation is warranted. The higher 
the costs of an intervention—that is, the greater the resources 
consumed—the lower the likelihood that a strong recommendation is warranted. Strong recommendations mean that most 
informed patients would choose the recommended management 
and that clinicians can structure their interactions with patients 
accordingly. Weak recommendations mean that patients’ choices 
will vary according to their values and preferences, and clinicians must ensure that patients’ care is in keeping with their 
values and preferences.
Bac kground
PBC is a chronic autoimmune cholestatic liver disease.2 3
Previous guidelines have included the European Association for 
the Study of the Liver (EASL) and American Association for 
the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) practice guidelines which 
review prior literature and cite many important references.4–6
These current guidelines build from previous documents and 
include an approach to the management of PBC wherein care is 
delivered to patients based on individual risk of disease-associated complications.
The characteristics of PBC are sustained elevation (>6 months) 
above the ULN for serum ALP activity, the presence of frequently 
granulomatous inflammation of the portal tracts accompanying 
lymphocytic mediated damage to (and destruction of) the small 
intrahepatic bile ducts, with accompanying cholestasis, and a 
typical pattern of serum and secretory autoantibodies reactive 
predominantly with mitochondrial antigens (AMA; reactivity 
with PBC-specific antinuclear antibodies (ANA) is also seen). 
The condition is progressive in most patients, with the development of biliary fibrosis and, ultimately, cirrhosis. The rate of 
progression to cirrhosis is variable between patients and modified by treatment with UDCA.7 8 Criteria defined for the study 
of the epidemiology of PBC have entered widespread clinical 
use and underpin inclusion criteria for current trials.9
 The presence of all three of cholestatic liver biochemistry, AMA or other 
PBC-specific autoantibody at a titre of >1/40, and diagnostic 
or supportive liver histology indicates definite PBC; two out of 
three indicates the presence of probable PBC. In clinical practice, the vast majority of patients are appropriately and confidently diagnosed without a liver biopsy, and in clinical practice 
the term 'probable PBC' should not be used with patients.10
Response to UDCA is variable, and incomplete response is associated with increased risk of death from PBC or need for liver 
transplantation.11–18
Epidemiology
The epidemiology of PBC has been studied extensively.19
PBC meets the criteria for rare disease status (prevalence 
<50/100000) in all populations studied.20 Data from the 
largest UK study, in the north-east of England, suggest a prevalence of definite or probable disease of 35/100000, with an 
annual incidence of 2–3/100000.21 22 Comparison with other 
Northern European and North American cohorts suggest these 
rates are broadly typical.23–30 Reported prevalence appears stable 
following several years of increase. This may reflect a now fully 
evolved change in diagnostic activity and practice linked to 
increased awareness of the disease.
PBC prevalence is asymmetrical within the population with 
markedly higher rates being seen in women than men (the difference is 10-fold).19 UK data suggest that PBC is diagnosed at a 
later stage in men, potentially reflecting perception bias among 
clinicians.12 PBC is also typically a disease of older patients 
with the median age at diagnosis being 65 years. The dual 
effects of age and sex mean that PBC can reach a prevalence 
of as high as 1 in 800 in women over the age of 45 years. PBC 
is yet to be reliably diagnosed pre-menarche (youngest report

is of a girl aged 15 years).31 There are potentially important 
differences in the clinical expression of PBC between men and 
women and between older and younger patients, although the 
basic approach to management is the same in all demographic 
groups.12 The impact of ethnicity on presentation is not well 
described, but there are reports internationally of how ethnicity 
affects the presentation of autoimmune liver disease, and clinicians should be aware that classical descriptions of disease are 
frequently derived from Caucasian-only populations.32–36
Familial PBC is clearly recognised, with familial rates similar 
to those seen in other autoimmune conditions. The reported 
sibling relative risk for PBC is 10.37 The relative risk for familial 
disease is greatest, at 35, for the daughters of mothers with PBC, 
reflecting in part the disease demographics. Patients with PBC 
typically have an increased incidence, in both themselves and 
their families, of other autoimmune diseases (over half of patients 
with PBC have another autoimmune condition), reflecting 
shared genetic predisposition (most notably but not exclusively 
celiac disease, scleroderma, thyroid disease and Sjögren’s).37–43
Aetiology
PBC is an immune-mediated biliary injury. Evidence supports 
the interaction of immunogenetic and environmental factors 
in the aetiology of PBC.3
 The presence of genetic susceptibility 
is supported by the increased concordance rate in monozygotic twins44 and confirmed by the identification of significant 
numbers of associated genetic loci in Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and other large-scale, high-quality 
genetic approaches.45–54 Identified genetic associations mirror 
the pattern and nature seen in autoimmune diseases with the 
combination of a significant number of genetic associations 
with low OR for risk, typically in genes regulating the magnitude and nature of the immune response.55 Study of the genetic 
basis of PBC remains a research tool and has, as yet, had no 
impact on clinical practice.56 The existence of disease clustering 
points to environmental triggers, and research has supported 
both infectious and chemical triggers.22 28 57–61 Case–control 
study approaches, which explore risk history in patients and 
matched controls, have confirmed cigarette smoking and recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) as being strongly associated 
with PBC; cholestasis and/or pruritus during prior pregnancy is 
also associated with future diagnosis of PBC.40 42 43 62 Other identified (but not confirmed) associations include hair dyeing and 
perming.63 At present there is no consensus as to causality of any 
environmental association, and the science relating to disease 
triggering is again a research tool with no immediate clinical 
relevance in terms of disease prevention in at-risk individuals. 
It is relevant to document smoking history, recurrent UTIs and 
pregnancy-related cholestasis; additionally, smoking is associated with more advanced disease at presentation, and guidance 
regarding cessation is appropriate.
How is PBC diagnosed?
Modes and routes of presentation
Increased awareness of the serological associations of PBC 
and the widespread use of blood test-based screening in the 
community has led to an evolution of the mode of presentation 
of PBC in recent years, away from presentation with clinically 
overt disease (eg, advanced liver disease)64 towards presentation 
following identification of liver biochemical abnormality on 
screening65(figure 1). Increasing awareness of PBC as a cause of 
chronic fatigue and pruritus may have led to an increase in diagnosis following symptomatic presentation. Given the efficacy 
of UDCA treatment in slowing disease progression, it makes 
sense that early diagnosis may facilitate better outcomes. Treatment failure is seen more commonly in those presenting with 
cirrhosis and in the ductopenic variant of PBC. Despite awareness of PBC and its target demographic, occasional patients still 
present with very advanced disease at the point of needing liver 
transplantation.
Blood tests
The diagnostic accuracy of the combination of cholestatic serum 
liver tests and PBC-specific serological markers (>95% for both 
sensitivity and specificity) means that blood tests lie at the heart 
of PBC diagnosis.10
Liver biochemistry
PBC is characterised, in its early stages, by elevation in serum 
ALP and GGT. Multiple studies on the biochemical response to 
UDCA therapy demonstrate the value of ALP following therapy 
as a useful prognostic marker. It is unclear at present whether 
ALP values are markers of response to other emerging forms of 
therapy in PBC, but recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
regulatory review has suggested there is at least reasonable 
evidence to consider ALP as a surrogate marker of treatment 
efficacy in PBC. Elevation in bilirubin and fall in serum albumin 
are features of advanced disease and are also important prognostic markers. Given the more diverse causes of elevations in 
GGT, to date the utility of GGT determination in patients with 
PBC has been to confirm a biliary origin of ALP, and not usually 
to reach a diagnosis or guide therapy. Further studies need to be 
performed before GGT can replace ALP with regard to diagnosis 
and treatment, although in the context of classical cholestasis a 
strong correlation between the two laboratory markers exists.
Autoantibodies
PBC is characterised serologically by autoantibodies specific for 
mitochondrial, nuclear and centromere antigens, some of which 
are unique to PBC.66–78 They are present in ~95% (mitochondrial) and ~30% (nuclear) of patients. Unlike in many other 
autoimmune diseases, these autoantibodies are, as a result of 
their sensitivity and specificity, extremely useful in diagnosis and 
have contributed significantly to the decline in the need for liver 
biopsy, at least for the purposes of diagnosis. Originally defined 
in terms of immunofluorescence (IF) patterns (AMA, anti-nuclear dot, anti-nuclear rim, anti-centromere, etc), the identification of the relevant autoantigens (2-oxo-acid dehydrogenase 
enzymes in the M2 mitochondrial fraction (in particular the E2 
component of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH)) and the Sp100 
and gp210 nuclear membrane proteins, respectively) has allowed 
the development of ELISA-based diagnostic kits and/or specific 
immunoblotting. The nature of the approach used for serodiagnosis in PBC (IF vs ELISA) is largely based on local experience 
and availability, and there is no clear evidence of superiority. IF is 
operator-dependent and reporting variability can relate to laboratory operator experience. There are also issues around availability and cost of composite tissue block substrates. IF, however, 
allows subtle autoantibody specificity variations (eg, the non-E2 
2-OADC antigens) to be detected. ELISA can have greater sensitivity and is less prone to non-specificity of reactivity resulting 
from the high levels of polyclonal immunoglobulin M (IgM) seen 
in PBC. Where PBC-related autoantibodies are detected in the 
context of an autoantibody profile performed following clinical 
suspicion of an alternative autoimmune disease, the possibility of

undiagnosed PBC must always be considered and liver function 
tests (LFTs) measured.77
A titre of >1 in 40 for any autoantibody linked to PBC is 
conventionally regarded as being positive.9
 Caution should be 
applied in interpreting lower titre autoantibody values because 
of the risk of non-specific reactivity and thus false positivity. Such 
findings need to be interpreted in the broader context of clinical 
presentation and other investigations, including other autoantibody assessment modalities such as ELISA following initial IF 
assessment. It is common practice in many centres to replicate 
AMA identified by IF by use of anti-M2 or other ELISA. For 
routine cases, with clear-cut high-titre reactivity in the primary 
assay used, there is usually no additional value from a confirmatory second assay.
There is no evidence to suggest that the concentration of AMA 
above the diagnostic threshold holds any prognostic significance. Repeat measurement is therefore not recommended once 
a clear-cut diagnosis is established. Additionally, the titre can 
fall on UDCA therapy and repeated measurement may therefore confuse unnecessarily. There is evidence to suggest that 
PBC-linked ANA (in particular anti-gp210/anti-nuclear rim antibody) may be associated with more rapidly progressive disease 
and disease which is less responsive to UDCA therapy.76 79–82
The clinical significance of AMA detected in the presence of 
normal liver biochemistry is currently unclear. Cohort studies 
from the 1980s showed that such AMA-positive patients with 
normal LFTs had a high frequency of biliary features of PBC 
on liver biopsy, and the majority went on to develop classical 
PBC over prolonged follow-up (although notably not advanced 
liver disease).83 84 More recent large-scale blood donor and 
population studies have suggested that low titre AMA positivity 
in the context of normal LFTs is seen in ~0.5% of the population.85 86 Whether this apparent increase in AMA positivity 
reflects false positivity arising, for example, in the context of 
other chronic inflammatory conditions, increased sensitivity of 
the modern assays, or a true increase in the prevalence of AMA 
resulting, for example, from increased environmental triggering 
with the potential to be followed by a significant increase in 
PBC incidence over time is unclear. The clinical context of any 
AMA result is therefore critical and further research is needed 
in this area. Given the benign prognosis in patients presenting 
with AMA and normal LFTs even in the historical series, neither 
biopsy nor use of UDCA therapy is recommended in this group. 
Follow-up of liver biochemistry in primary care (following 
initial assessment in the secondary setting) is suggested. Standard advice is for the patient to have serum liver tests repeated 
annually. If those tests become abnormal, patients should either 
be re-referred to secondary care (most common practice) or have 
UDCA commenced if the abnormality in ALP is for longer than 
6 months. Additionally, the context of the immunological profile

needs to be considered with a lower threshold for intervention 
in patients with other classic autoimmune diseases such as celiac 
disease or primary Sjögren’s syndrome.
Immunoglobulins
Changes in immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM concentrations 
are seen in patients with PBC. A polyclonal elevation of IgM is 
characteristic of PBC,87 88 with the majority of patients having a 
non-specific elevation in IgM concentration. In one well-characterised cohort of patients with PBC,89 the mean IgM concentration was 2.4 x ULN, and 1.16 x ULN for IgG at baseline. 
High IgM concentrations (which do not reflect the presence of 
IgM autoantibody) do not form part of standard diagnostic paradigms but can be useful in making a clinical diagnosis in patients 
with atypical other features. IgM reduction with UDCA and 
experimental second-line therapies has been reported, but the 
prognostic significance of such change has yet to be established 
and IgM response does not currently feature in any response 
assessment paradigms.90 91 Further research is needed in this 
area. Elevation of serum IgG can be a feature of the presence 
of additional autoimmune hepatitis (AIH)-like features in PBC, 
but is also more commonly reported in AMA-negative series, 
and is additionally likely equally frequently to be a reflection of 
advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis generally.
Recommendat ion 1
We recommend that any patient with persistently elevated 
cholestatic liver biochemistry (raised ALP or GGT) without 
an alternative cause should have autoantibodies checked for 
anti-mitochondrial (AMA) and anti-nuclear (ANA) reactivity. 
(Strong; High)
Recommendat ion 2
We recommend that the presence of AMA (>1 in 40) or highly 
PBC-specific ANA, in the appropriate context of cholestatic liver 
biochemistry, without alternative explanation, is usually sufficient for confidently reaching the diagnosis of PBC. (Strong; 
High)
Recommendat ion 3
We recommend that, for patients in whom the clinical suspicion 
for PBC is high but classical indicators of disease are discordant 
(eg, normal liver biochemistry, serology at a low titre), further 
investigation and review is required prior to establishing a diagnosis of PBC or initiating therapy. (Strong; Moderate)
Imaging
The role of imaging in the diagnosis of PBC is largely to exclude 
alternative diagnoses, particularly biliary and infiltrative disease, 
such that for the vast majority a screening ultrasound suffices. 
Particular attention to exclusion of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and its mimics by magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is warranted for seronegative patients. 
Gallstones are a frequent finding in patients with PBC and are 
typically clinically silent. The over-interpretation of the presence 
of gallstones in patients of the typical PBC demographic, with the 
failure to consider PBC as the underlying diagnosis, is a potential 
reason for delayed diagnosis of PBC. MRCP is typically normal 
in patients with PBC. Enlargement of the peri-portal lymph 
nodes is common in PBC (and liver disease generally) and can 
cause concern about the possible presence of malignancy. Biopsy 
of such nodes typically shows the presence of reactive/inflammatory changes and the enlargement is thought to be part of the 
underlying disease process in PBC. Clinical judgement should 
be used as to whether the rare concern about the possibility of 
haematological or other forms of malignant disease is sufficient 
to warrant biopsy exclusion on a case-by-case basis. In end-stage 
PBC, imaging to screen for the complications of cirrhosis should 
be routine as for cirrhosis of other aetiology.
Histological features of PBC
Histopathological evaluation of liver biopsy tissue in PBC can be 
challenging and interpretation of histological findings needs to 
be correlated with clinical and immunological features, given the 
frequent patchy nature of PBC throughout the liver as well as 
the importance of recognising that, in early stage disease, characteristic features may be absent. As with all liver biopsy interpretation, but notably in the context of biliary disease, adequate 
biopsy size is essential. The adequacy of any biopsy is of course 
related to the clinical question, but broadly a liver biopsy should 
be of large enough size to view a representative amount of 
parenchyma and number of portal tracts (proposed to be more 
than 11).92 Hallmarks of PBC include destructive granulomatous 
lymphocytic cholangitis affecting interlobular and septal bile 
ducts leading to progressive bile duct loss, chronic cholestasis, 
fibrosis and cirrhosis. Other features that are seen include 
lymphocytic interface activity, parenchymal necro-inflammation 
and nodular regenerative hyperplasia.93 94 The significance of 
features such as interface hepatitis is best interpreted through 
joint clinicopathological discussion. While historically staging of 
liver disease with biopsy was frequently undertaken, increasingly 
it is recognised that risk stratification is more relevant to clinical 
practice, and staging of disease (as is required to determine the 
need for surveillance of cirrhotic complications) can usually be 
adequately evaluated non-invasively. Nevertheless, in those for 
whom biopsy is indicated either because of clinical trial entry 
or because of concern over diagnosis and/or presence of overlap 
features, histological stage, presence of ductopenia (>50%bile 
duct loss) and severity of lymphocytic interface activity are 
significant predictors of fibrosis progression.18 95 96
Role of liver biopsy and other staging investigations
Liver biopsy for the diagnosis of PBC in cases with clear cut 
autoantibody reactivity and cholestatic liver biochemistry is not 
recommended as it does not add to the diagnostic accuracy.10 It 
is also not uncommon to see areas of non-involved liver within 
even cirrhotic liver which, if sampled at biopsy, can confound 
diagnosis.97 Moreover, the yield for diagnostic lesions characteristic of PBC falls to less than 50% in early disease (ie, false-negative biopsies are likely in very early stage disease).98 Liver 
tissue abnormality in PBC can be highly patchy in nature, with 
reports of all disease stages from 1 to 4 (cirrhosis) being found 
in the same explanted organ at liver transplantation.99 For these 
reasons, staging biopsy to determine disease progression and 
establish or exclude the presence of cirrhosis is also not recommended routinely. The existing concept of AIH overlap disease 
which potentially may benefit from corticosteroid therapy, and 
the emerging concept of high-risk disease with a low level of 
response to UDCA and the concomitant need for second-line 
therapy, mean that liver biopsy may have a value in disease stratification and selection of appropriate additional or second-line 
therapy in PBC. The precise value and timing of prognostic liver 
biopsy in PBC remains to be established, as does the role of 
specific pathological scoring systems. A brief discussion of histological scoring systems100–104 which have been used in PBC is 
included in the legend to figure 2.

Both enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF)105 and transient elastography (TE)106 107 (eg, FibroScan) have, in cross-sectional studies, 
shown accuracy in determining disease stage as confirmed by 
biopsy. There are no data, at the individual patient level, regarding 
change in these parameters with time and their relationship to 
change in the disease characteristics. While their use is increasing 
in clinical practice because of access to ELF testing and/or TE 
machines, their optimal use is currently a research question and 
the findings are not, in routine practice, as yet linked into paradigms for location and intensity of patient follow-up. Systematic 
evaluation of these approaches, together with recently described 
laboratory parameter-based scoring formulae,108 109 in identifying high- and low-risk patients in whom to target enhanced

Figure 2 The histopathology of PBC classical staging systems for PBC divide the histological injury of PBC into four stages: florid duct lesions and 
portal inflammation without interface activity (stage 1), interface hepatitis, ductular proliferation and periportal fibrosis (stage 2), bridging necrosis 
or bridging fibrosis (stage 3), and cirrhosis (stage 4).93 These systems are easy to apply and are quite reproducible. However, their practical utility is 
limited because of the uneven distribution of diagnostic histological lesions of PBC and different disease stages co-existing at any time.93 Furthermore, 
they incorporate features such as inflammation, which are more appropriately regarded as a manifestation of disease activity (histological ‘grade’) 
rather than disease progression (histological ‘stage’). A more recent scoring system described by Nakanuma and colleagues sums up individual 
scores for fibrosis, bile duct loss and severity of chronic cholestasis based on copper-associated protein deposition to assess disease stage and 
provides a separate system for grading necroinflammatory activity based on cholangitic and hepatitic features.100 Similar to the classical staging 
systems, the Nakanuma staging system correlates well with clinical and laboratory features. Subsequent studies have suggested that the Nakanuma 
system is more useful than previously described staging systems in predicting adverse outcomes in patients with PBC101 102 and may also be helpful 
in predicting treatment responses.79 Another recently described histological scoring system for PBC based on prognostically significant lesions (ie, 
fibrosis, bile duct loss and lymphocytic interface hepatitis) showed better interobserver agreement and correlation with biochemical abnormalities 
than traditional scoring systems, but predictive value for adverse outcomes could not be assessed.103 Problems with sampling variability apply to all 
of the histological staging systems that have been described for patients with PBC, which limits the utility of liver biopsy to assess disease severity in 
routine clinical practice, but they may still have a role in the context of clinical trials where liver biopsies have been used for risk stratification and as 
a surrogate marker of treatment outcomes. (A) Early PBC is characterised mainly by portal lesions and mild necroinflammatory changes in the acini. 
Portal tracts may show cholangiocentric granulomatous inflammation composed of lymphocytes, occasionally numerous plasmacytes, and polymorphs 
including eosinophils. Lymphoid follicles with germinal centres may form. The lymphoid inflammatory infiltrate extends to the biliary epithelium 
(cholangitis) (arrow), disrupting the basement membrane sometimes leading to bile duct destruction (florid duct lesion). Granulomas, ranging from 
small collections of histiocytes to easily discerned non-caseating epithelioid granulomas, may be present in portal tracts near damaged bile ducts 
and less often in the acini. In the progressive lesion of PBC, lymphocytic interface hepatitis may predominate blurring the portal tract boundary and 
extending into the acinus (arrowheads). Ductular proliferation at the portal-parenchymal interface may be prominent with associated stromal oedema 
and neutrophilic inflammation. Parenchymal necroinflammatory activity and hepatocellular injury are usually mild. Small and large cell change 
and hepatocellular regeneration may be seen (H&E, x20). (B) Keratin 7 immunostaining highlights loss of bile ducts (arrowhead indicates a keratin 
7-positive bile duct epithelial remnant) leading to chronic cholestasis with features of feathery degeneration, Mallory-Denk bodies, copper-associated 
protein deposition in periportal/periseptal hepatocytes (cholate stasis), cholestatic rosettes and biliary metaplasia of hepatocytes (arrow) (keratin 7 
immunostain, DAB chromagen, x10). (C) Loss of canals of Hering in acinar zone 1 (arrowheads) detected by keratin 19 immunostaining has recently 
been proposed as an early feature of PBC in the absence of the classic destructive biliary lesions.104 Focal intraepithelial inflammation (cholangitis) is 
noted in the K19-positive interlobular bile duct (arrow) (keratin 19 immunostain, DAB chromagen, x20).

use) or the presence of overlapping autoimmune hepatitis, either at 
diagnosis or during follow-up. (Strong; Moderate)
What other conditions should be considered in 
the differential diagnosis of PBC?
The diagnosis of PBC usually causes little confusion because 
of the specificity and sensitivity of PBC-associated autoantibodies.110 Care must be taken in autoantibody-negative disease, 
with the chief differential being small duct PSC. Other differential diagnoses which should be considered include sarcoid, 
graft-versus-host disease (in appropriately at-risk individuals), 
idiopathic ductopenia, drug-induced liver injury and variants 
of genetic cholestatic syndromes. Care must also be taken with 
patients with ‘low titre’ AMA because of the danger of autoantibody false positivity in inflammatory conditions, in particular 
NAFLD, where low level rises in ALP are not infrequent.
What conditions are associated with PBC?
PBC is principally associated with other autoimmune conditions 
reflecting shared immunogenetic susceptibility.19 38 The strongest 
association is with Sjögren’s syndrome (most frequently secondary 
‘sicca complex’ although primary Sjögren’s syndrome is associated) 
and the management of the symptoms of sicca complex can be an 
important part of controlling the overall symptom burden in PBC. 
The presence of associated thyroid disease (present in up to 25% 
of patients) or anaemia with an immune/autoimmune aetiology 
(including pernicious anaemia, autoimmune haemolytic anaemia 
and celiac disease) should be considered in patients with prominent fatigue. At presentation and follow-up, consideration should 
be given to testing for these conditions.
Osteoporosis is frequent in PBC, although it is best regarded as a 
complication of the metabolic changes seen in cholestasis including 
reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamins.111–113
Recurrent UTIs have been associated with PBC in several epidemiological studies.62 114 It is unclear whether the association is a 
cause or a consequence of PBC, and thus whether aggressively 
treating UTIs may have any impact on the natural history of PBC. 
Recurrent UTIs are, however, a potential cause of impaired QoL in 
PBC and should be effectively managed for this reason.
Despite elevation of cholesterol being a frequent feature in PBC, 
there is no robust evidence to suggest that ischaemic heart disease 
or other forms of atherosclerotic disease are seen at increased 
frequency in the condition.115–118 This is likely to reflect the fact 
that cholesterol elevation is typically high-density lipoprotein 
(HDL) and lipoprotein X. There is no evidence that statin therapy 
is associated with increased risk of liver injury and these drugs 
can be used as would be indicated in patients without PBC.119–121
Of relevance to cardiac risk is the observation from case–control 
epidemiology studies that there is a significant rate of cigarette 
smoking in PBC.43 122 123
Recommendat ion 9
We suggest that at baseline it is reasonable to screen all patients 
with PBC for celiac, thyroid disease and Sjögren’s syndrome. 
During follow-up, patients should be monitored clinically, and we 
suggest testing considered for the development of associated autoimmune conditions including celiac, thyroid disease and Sjögren’s 
syndrome based on clinical need. (Weak; Moderate)
Recommendat ion 10
We recommend that there is no substantiated evidence that the 
hyperlipidaemia of PBC is associated with an elevated cardiac 
risk, and a patient’s need for lipid-lowering therapy should be 
evaluated using cardiovascular risk assessment, focusing on 
identification of patients with PBC and metabolic syndrome 
(with high cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol and high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels). There is no added 
contraindication to the use of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in 
patients with PBC. (Strong; Low)
What is the natural history of PBC?
PBC is a chronic disease, generally characterised by a slow 
progression. The clinical course can, however, be highly variable. The majority of patients diagnosed today are asymptomatic 
at diagnosis and one contemporary series showed that nearly 
90% do not have fibrosis when first identified (although others 
have shown higher rates potentially reflecting case mix).11 12 26 27
The initial 10-year follow-up report of asymptomatic disease 
suggested that 50% of asymptomatic patients became symptomatic over this period of time.124 More recent studies with longer 
follow-up indicate that, although asymptomatic disease tends 
to progress at a much slower rate than symptomatic disease, 
survival of both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with 
PBC is significantly less than that of the general population.125 126
It should be noted, however, that in many earlier studies of 
symptomatic disease the definition of symptomatic included 
the presence of features such as jaundice or ascites which would 
more accurately be regarded as features of advanced disease, the 
association of which with poor prognosis is unsurprising. One 
UK study suggested absolute survival was the same regardless 
of symptoms, although notably the cause of death in those who 
were asymptomatic was more commonly non-hepatic, and those 
without symptoms had less severe disease at diagnosis.65 There 
are significant issues with aspects of this historical literature such 
as age differences in study groups (asymptomatic patients are 
frequently older at presentation than symptomatic) and the use 
of symptomatic versus asymptomatic disease as an approach to 
determining prognosis in practice has largely fallen out of favour. 
What can be concluded from these and other studies is that PBC 
is not a benign disease, symptoms are important and frequent, 
and they should be evaluated more consistently.
Importantly, the presence or absence of cirrhosis taken in 
isolation is not a highly predictive surrogate marker for risk 
of death in PBC. A detailed review of liver histology suggests 
that the presence of a lymphoplasmacytic interface hepatitis is a 
marker of more rapidly progressive disease14 96 and, in another 
report of four cases, rapidly progressive bile duct loss, even in 
the absence of cirrhosis, led to liver failure; this is the so-called 
‘pre-cirrhotic ductopenic’ variant of PBC, characteristic of early 
onset symptomatic (pruritus) disease.127
It is relevant to appreciate rates of histological progression: 
Corpechot et al described the progression toward cirrhosis in 183 
patients treated with UDCA.96 The incidence of cirrhosis after 
5 years of UDCA treatment was 4% and 59% among patients 
followed-up from stages 1 (early disease) and 3 (fibrosis), respectively (17% and 76%, respectively after 10 years). The median 
time for developing cirrhosis from stages 1 and 3 was 25 years 
and 4 years, respectively. The independent predictive factors of 
cirrhosis development were serum bilirubin >17 µmol/L, serum 
albumin <38g/L and moderate to severe lymphocytic interface 
hepatitis. Future validation of this observation regarding the 
importance of interface hepatitis is significant, as are identifying other potential factors. There is no good evidence that the 
AMA titre correlates with the course of PBC (although it can 
fall with treatment),90 but some groups have suggested specific 
anti-nuclear antibodies may delineate subtypes of PBC (gp210

Recommendat ion 11
We recommend all patients with PBC should be offered structured life-long follow-up, recognising that different patients 
have different disease courses and may require different intensity 
of follow-up. (Strong; Moderate)
Stratification of future risk and prognostic
scoring systems
PBC is primarily a biliary disease, so when signs of failure 
of hepatocyte function develop, such as coagulopathy (not 
corrected by vitamin K) or jaundice, these usually indicate 
advanced and typically irreversible disease (assuming there is no 
additional reversible element such as drug injury). There are no 
symptoms present in patients with purely compensated disease 
which correlate with outcome (neither fatigue nor pruritus 
correlate with the severity of disease as judged by serum bilirubin 
or the Mayo risk score; indeed, pruritus frequently diminishes 
as the disease progresses).130 In one report of development of 
advanced disease features in 770 patients, ascites was present in 
20% and bleeding varices in 10.5% after 10 years of follow-up.65
The outlook for patients who develop these complications is 
worse, and new portal hypertension complicated by ascites is an 
indicator of poor short-term prognosis. In 143 patients who first 
developed ascites or peripheral oedema, the mean time to death 
was 3.1 years.131 Once a patient develops jaundice, the natural 
history of disease in the absence of treatment is more predictable, with the degree of bilirubin elevation correlating strongly 
with survival. The liver insufficiency phase is characterised by 
worsening jaundice and is typically pre-terminal: mean survival 
once the bilirubin is 34 μmol/L is 4 years, and when the bilirubin 
reaches 102 μmol/L mean survival is only 2 years.132 This underpins the concept of thinking about liver transplantation once a 
patient has a bilirubin level >50 μmol/L and, if otherwise appropriate, listing for liver transplantation when bilirubin is >100 
μmol/L. Hepatic encephalopathy (HE), when it occurs, is usually 
during this phase. As with pruritus, ALP and cholesterol may all 
paradoxically improve in the pre-terminal stage. The introduction of UDCA therapy, which was demonstrated in early studies 
to reduce serum bilirubin concentrations, has been shown not to 
invalidate either the absolute serum bilirubin or the Mayo risk 
score as prognostic markers.133
More sophisticated risk scores designed to predict prognosis 
in patients with PBC have been developed, and in particular 
recent approaches to survival analysis have addressed whether 
simple assessments of biochemical response to treatment, in 
particular with UDCA, may be useful clinically, and whether 
variability in such response may underpin the heterogeneity of 
earlier treatment and outcome studies (table 1).134 Stratification 
by biochemistry has now been reproduced widely across cohorts 
and is recommended for all patients after 1year of UDCA 
therapy. This is in order to identify those high-risk patients who 
are predicted to have reduced survival and are considered likely 
to benefit from new disease-modifying therapy trials. In addition 
to stratification by biochemistry, large-scale studies have been 
able to confirm clinical observations that age at presentation and 
gender are also stratifiers of risk. It is currently unclear as to 
which risk/response criteria are optimal for use in clinical practice. At present it is unclear what the significance is of meeting 
response criteria prior to therapy and what impact this should 
have, if any, on the use of UDCA therapy. Conversely, classifying 
low risk more effectively may have value in reducing secondary 
care follow-up for many. To that effect, more dynamic linear 
risk models have been developed, but at this stage we need more 
information about how to implement these clinically.108 109
Appreciating the evolution of these risk scores is, however, 
important in understanding the strengths and weaknesses associated with biochemical risk stratification in PBC. Historically, the 
Mayo PBC risk score130 (age, serum bilirubin and albumin, coagulation time and the presence of fluid retention and/or use of 
diuretics) was used to predict outcome in late-stage PBC. Similarly, generic scoring systems such as the Model For End-Stage 
Liver Disease (MELD)135 136 or United Kingdom Model for 
End-Stage Liver Disease (UKELD)137 scores are of value once 
again when the disease is advanced. Parés et al assessed the 
course and survival of patients with PBC treated with UDCA and 
compared this with the survival predicted by the Mayo model 
and the estimated survival of a standardised population.13 In this 
study a response to treatment was defined by an ALP decrease 
greater than 40% of baseline values or normal levels after 1year 
of treatment (‘Barcelona criteria’). The observed survival free of 
transplant was higher than that predicted by the Mayo model, 
but lower than that of the control Spanish population. Just under 
two-thirds of patients responded to treatment according to the 
study definition, and the survival of responders was significantly 
higher than that predicted by the Mayo model and similar to 
that estimated for the control population (but only if they were 
treated at an early stage of disease). In a French study, biochemical response to UDCA was correlated with long-term prognosis 
in 292 patients.14 Those showing ALP <3ULN, AST<2ULN 
and bilirubin ≤17 µmol/L after 1year of UDCA had a 10-year 
transplant-free survival rate of 90% compared with 51% (‘Paris I 
criteria’). A further evolution of this model has focused on early 
stage disease (‘Paris II criteria’),15 while a stratification based on 
ALP treatment response correlates biochemistry and histological progression (‘Toronto criteria’).18 The ‘Rotterdam criteria’ 
are focused towards liver function/stage, including albumin and 
bilirubin.17 Huet et al have used a different approach looking 
at portal hypertension.138 A total of 132 patients had porto-hepatic gradient and biochemical values measured at inclusion and 
every 2 years. After 2 years of treatment, a decreased or stable 
porto-hepatic gradient (HR 4.64; 95% CI 2.01 to 10.72) and 
normalisation of AST level (HR 2.89; 95% CI 1.03 to 8.05) were 
predictive of better survival on multivariate analysis. Responders 
(defined as either stable or improved porto-hepatic gradient and 
normalised AST level at 2 years) had a 15-year survival similar 
to that of a matched local Canadian population. In keeping with 
this, Trivedi et al in a cohort of over 1000 patients confirmed 
that the AST:platelet ratio is not only independently associated 
with outcome, but is additive to classic biochemical stratifiers.139
Further refinement of stratification tools has been possible by 
use of large cohorts, and this has led to two important non-categorical scores: the Global PBC score109 and the UK-PBC risk 
score.108 These scoring systems derive from large multicentre 
cohorts and convey probability of survival on a continuous, as 
opposed to dichotomous, scale (area under the receiver operator curve >0.9). In addition to being internally validated, the 
latter in particular has been compared against a healthy age- and 
sex-matched control population.
It is of course clear that there are varied criteria for evaluating 
treatment response. In clinical practice the expert group noted 
that criteria applied to recruitment into clinical trials were the 
ones seemingly used in wider spread practice at the current time 
in the UK that is focused around an ALP >1.67 x ULN.

Recommendat ion 12
Risk assessment should evaluate disease severity and activity at 
baseline and on treatment. We recommend a combination of 
serum liver tests (to identify those with an elevated bilirubin, 
a platelet count <150 or biochemical disease activity on treatment), imaging (liver ultrasound to identify overt cirrhosis 
and splenomegaly; TE to identify increased liver stiffness) and 
recognition of young age at disease onset (<45 years) and male 
sex. These can all aid risk stratification for patients with PBC.

To identify those at greatest risk of disease progression, we 
recommend that all patients have individualised risk stratification using biochemical response indices following 1year of 
UDCA therapy. (Strong; High)
Recommendat ion 14
Prospective research is required to better evaluate risk stratification tools, but we suggest that UDCA treated patients with an 
ALP >1.67x ULN and/or elevated bilirubin <2x ULN represent a group of high-risk patients in whom there is randomised 
controlled trial evidence for the addition of second-line therapy.

Recommendat ion 15
It is unclear as to when to repeat risk evaluation in patients stratified to a low-risk group. However, we suggest that all patients 
with PBC should have annual serum liver tests and documented 
repeat risk assessment every 3 years. Low-risk patients can be 
considered to be those without cirrhosis who have an ALP 
<1.67x ULN and a normal bilirubin. (Weak; Moderate)

hypertension or complex symptoms have disease for which 
hospital-led care is indicated. We suggest that patients with 
non-cirrhotic, UDCA-responsive disease without high symptom 
burden may have disease that, in the context of appropriate 
service configuration and agreed care pathways, can be led from 
primary care. (Weak; Low)
How should pat ients with PBC be managed?
The care of patients with PBC encompasses many aspects 
addressing disease progression and symptom control (figure 1).
Drug therapy to prevent disease progression
Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)
Oral UDCA has been studied widely and discussed in depth with 
regard to its efficacy.140 The use of UDCA is recommended for 
all patients with PBC by AASLD and EASL, as well as in this 
guideline.141–151 A number of other agents have been studied 
including immunosuppressants, but reproducible and/or consistent evidence of benefit has been universally lacking. Prior studies 
of failed alternative therapies are not reviewed here in detail.2
UDCA normally accounts for about 4% of bile acids, but with 
pharmacotherapy it becomes the predominant bile acid.152–154
Several studies have confirmed a correlation between the degree 
of bile enrichment and improvement in liver biochemistry. 
Overall, the data suggest that the optimum dose is 13–15mg/
kg per day, which can be given as a single oral daily dose or 
in divided doses if tolerability is an issue. When evaluating the 
UDCA trial data, note must be taken of the treatment dose used 
because some earlier studies applied lower than optimal treatment paradigms. In PBC, a dose of 13–15mg/kg/day has been 
shown to be superior to 5–7mg/kg/day or 23–25mg/kg/day. 
UDCA at the recommended dose is very safe with minimal side 
effects (weight gain of ~3kg in the first 12 months, hair loss and, 
rarely, diarrhoea and flatulence are reported). There are no data 
to suggest that UDCA is teratogenic. Evidence-based advice over 
use in pregnancy is lacking, but expert clinical practice generally 
includes safe use before and during the first trimester; a good 
safety profile exists from its use in intrahepatic cholestasis of 
pregnancy.155 156
Many studies have attempted to demonstrate clinical efficacy 
for UDCA and most trials show beneficial effects on biochemical parameters in particular. With such a slow natural history, 
however, any individual trial in PBC will inevitably lack the 
power to address end points such as death or liver transplantation. Additional criticism can be made for assuming that every 
patient benefits equally—that is, identifying and treating more 
patients with mild disease may be self-fulfilling if those patients 
were never destined to progress, and historical failure to stratify 
patients may have confused the literature.
Three large double-blind randomised trials used the same 
dose of UDCA (13–15mg/kg/day), and thus the results have 
been analysed according to an intention-to-treat principle. In 
two of these a composite ‘treatment failure’ outcome measure 
was used, and in the third the percentage change in total serum 
bilirubin over 2 years was used as the primary outcome measure. 
Few adverse effects of UDCA were reported and the withdrawal 
rate was less than 20% in all three studies. In two of the three 
trials a crossover design was adopted, with some patients initially 
randomised to placebo switching to open-label UDCA after the 
first 24 months. However, the results were analysed according 
to intention-to-treat, so that those patients initially randomised 
to receive placebo and subsequently switched to receive UDCA 
remained in the placebo group for the purposes of analysis. 
Ultimately then, this combined analysis of the three trials (548 
patients) showed a one-third reduction in the risk of death or 
transplant for patients with moderate to severe PBC. Subgroup 
analyses showed that survival free of liver transplantation was 
significantly improved in medium- and high-risk groups (serum 
bilirubin 1.4–3.5 or >3.5mg/dL; P<0.0001and P<0.03, respectively) and histological stage IV subgroup (P<0.01). One other 
concern raised was the observation that those patients crossed 
over to UDCA continued to have a poorer clinical course. 
A further large trial (151 patients) employed a lower dose 
(10–12mg/kg bodyweight daily) and a different preparation of 
UDCA. After 2 years of treatment no difference in survival was 
seen, there being eight deaths in those randomised to UDCA and 
12 in those randomised to placebo. Prolonged follow-up also 
showed no survival benefit.
A key factor in the debate over UDCA efficacy is the limitations 
in the quality of the underlying source trial data with varying, 
and often inadequate, sample size and duration of several studies, 
as well as inclusion of data from trials using suboptimal doses. 
Since not all placebo or non-intervention patients were eventually given UDCA (although a majority were), the evaluation of 
the non-randomised phases of these trials has biases with implications for the basis for an intention-to-treat analysis. Of the 
16 randomised clinical trials evaluating UDCA against placebo, 
nearly half of the trials had a high risk of bias. In all studies, 
the administration of UDCA was associated with an improvement in liver biochemistry. An updated Cochrane meta-analysis 
shows that overt ascites and obvious jaundice are less frequent 
in patients randomised to UDCA, but there was no difference in 
the number of patients with bleeding varices or HE. These data 
suggest that prolonged treatment with UDCA, started at early 
stages of disease, are likely required to exert a maximal positive effect on the natural course of disease. The meta-analysis 
that was confined to trials using an appropriate dose of UDCA 
(>10mg/kg/day) and with sufficient follow-up (at least 2 years) 
included a total of 1038 patients (522 who received UDCA and 
516 who received placebo). Treatment with UDCA resulted in 
significant improvement in liver biochemical values. Histological 
evidence of disease progression was similar for the two treatment 
groups, but subjects without evidence of fibrosis (stages 1 and 2) 
who were treated with UDCA had slower disease progression 
than subjects in the control group. A total of 160 patients who 
were treated with UDCA and 186 control subjects died or underwent liver transplantation. This difference was significant in a 
fixed-effect model (OR 0.76; 95% CI, 0.57 to 1.00; P=0.05) 
but not in a random-effects model (OR 0.77; 95%CI 0.50 to 
1.21; P=0.30).
Recommendat ion 18
We recommend that oral UDCA at 13–15mg/kg/day is used as 
the first-line pharmacotherapy in all patients with PBC. If tolerated, treatment should usually be life-long. (Strong; High)
Obeticholic acid (OCA)
OCA is a semi-synthetic hydrophobic bile acid analogue that is 
highly selective for farnesoid X receptor (FXR), having exponential activation potency relative to the endogenous counterpart 
chenodeoxycholic acid. OCA also induces expression of gut-derived hormones, in particular fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19). The nuclear receptor FXR is a central transcriptional sensor 
of bile acid metabolic cascades, and FXR is highly expressed in 
the liver and in enterocytes. The main FXR target gene in the 
gut is FGF-19, which is an enterokine secreted into the portal

blood on bile acid stimulation. FGF-19 reaches the liver where 
it activates the duo fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4)/
beta KLOTHO on the hepatocyte basolateral membrane triggering intracellular pathways that repress cholesterol 7-α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), which is the rate-limiting enzyme in bile 
acid synthesis. FXR signalling directly regulates genes involved 
in bile acid synthesis, secretion, transport, absorption and detoxification; additionally, FXR signalling impacts on inflammation, 
metabolic regulation and liver fibrosis.157
Relevant trial data reflect studies spanning phase II and III 
drug development. In a phase II randomised double-blind 
controlled trial of OCA in PBC, the therapeutic efficacy of three 
doses (10, 25 and 50mg/day) as add-on therapy to UDCA in a 
multicentre study restricted to patients having persistent elevations in serum ALP (>1.5 × ULN) was evaluated.91 The primary 
endpoint was a significant reduction in serum ALP from baseline, and was met across all three doses of OCA versus placebo. 
Moreover, 87%, 69% and 7% of all OCA-treated patients 
completing therapy achieved a decline in serum ALP of at least 
10%, 20% or complete normalisation (vs 14%, 8% and 0% 
with placebo). In a phase III clinical trial (PBC OCA International Study of Efficacy), patients with PBC with high-risk PBC 
(prior biochemical non-response according to modified Toronto 
criteria; ALP >1.67 x ULN and/or elevated total bilirubin 
<2 x ULN) were evaluated in a randomised placebo-controlled 
manner.158 The primary endpoint during the 12-month doubleblind period was attainment of both an ALP value <1.67 ×ULN 
(with a ≥15%reduction from baseline) and a normal serum 
bilirubin. In an intention-to-treat analysis, biochemical response 
was met in 10% of the placebo group and in 47% and 46% in 
the 10mg and 5–10mg dose-titrated OCA groups, respectively 
(P<0.0001 for both). Moreover, the mean decrease in serum 
ALP from baseline was 39% and 33% in the 10mg and titrated 
OCA groups, respectively, versus 5% for patients in the placebo 
group (P<0.0001 for both). Both OCA groups met predefined 
secondary endpoints including reduction in serum AST and total 
serum bilirubin (both OCA groups P<0.001vs placebo).
Longer-term efficacy of OCA and generalisability to the 
patient population as a whole needs confirmation in prospective follow-up studies. Survival benefit has yet to be demonstrated and, for that purpose, a long-term randomised trial is 
currently ongoing. In using OCA, attention is important to 
assessing the likelihood of benefit, and in those patients with 
advanced disease dose adjustment is important. More experience is needed in patients with advanced liver disease and, while 
there were patients with cirrhosis in the pivotal trial of Nevens 
et al,
158 there were no patients with decompensation. As per 
the drug label, OCA is dose adjusted to 5mg weekly initially 
(with a maximum dose of 10mg twice weekly) in Child Pugh B 
or C liver disease. It may well also be prudent when initiating 
therapy in a patient with Child Pugh A liver disease to also dose 
adjust in the presence of portal hypertension. Cirrhotic patients, 
particularly once evidence of portal hypertension exists, should 
have intensified early safety evaluation (e.g. repeat blood tests 
monthly at outset) and, in the context of development of decompensation or progression of liver disease, OCA dose adjustment 
or treatment cessation may be indicated.
Treatment with OCA is associated with a dose-dependent 
exacerbation in pruritus leading to treatment discontinuation in 1–10% of patients. These observations emphasise the 
importance of dose titration with or without timelyprovision 
of therapy (rifampicin may be preferred, given potential interactions with bile acid sequestrants leading to fecal OCA loss) 
for symptom control. OCA-treated patients may also exhibit 
(reversible) alterations in serum lipid levels; specifically, most 
notably a small decrease in HDL. It is not yet known whether 
these consequences impact the long-term cardiovascular risk.
NICE has appraised OCA (https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/
ta443) and recommended OCA within its marketing authorisation as an option for treating PBC in combination with UDCA 
for people whose disease has responded inadequately to UDCA 
or as monotherapy for those who cannot tolerate UDCA. NICE 
recommended that clinicians assess the response to OCA after 
12 months and that treatment should only continue if there is 
evidence of clinical benefit.
Recommendat ion 19
In patients with an inadequate response to UDCA (or UDCA 
intolerance) as defined by ALP >1.67 x ULN and/or elevated 
bilirubin <2 x ULN, the addition of OCA (initial dose 5mg/day, 
titrating to 10mg/day at 6 months if tolerated) has been associated with improvements in biochemical surrogates of disease 
activity reasonably likely to predict improved outcomes. We 
recommend, in keeping with the NICE evaluation of OCA, that 
the addition of OCA for patients with an inadequate response to 
UDCA, or intolerant of UDCA, is considered. We recommend 
dose adjustment in patients with advanced liver disease as per 
the drug label, and careful evaluation of potential benefits and 
risks, as well as monitoring, in patients with very advanced liver 
disease (Child Pugh A liver disease with portal hypertension; 
Child Pugh B and C liver disease). (Strong; Low)
Off-label therapies
Off-label use of drugs such as budesonide and fibrates has not 
gained much traction in clinical practice in the UK, in contrast to 
other countries such as France and Japan. Recommendations for 
unlicensed therapies in the UK are not presently made pending 
review and publication of phase III trials as below; this is in 
keeping with recent guidelines from EASL.6
In patients with PBC exhibiting ‘florid’ interface hepatitis on biopsy, there are reports demonstrating the efficacy of 
budesonide in improving liver histology and biochemistry when 
used in combination with UDCA. A randomised placebo-controlled trial (n=39) was the first to study budesonide (9mg/
day) as add-on therapy to UDCA in patients with early-stage 
PBC.159 Over the 2-year study period, patients with combination 
therapy exhibited a significant reduction in serum ALP as well 
as improvement in liver histology according to the Ludwig classification system. Moreover, in a subsequent 3-year randomised 
non-blinded study performed in non-cirrhotic PBC patients 
(n=77), budesonide 6mg/day plus UDCA (n=46) was associated with a 25% regression in liver fibrosis.160 However, despite 
encouraging results, note must be taken of a high rate of fibrosis 
progression (an increase of 70%) in patients receiving UDCA 
monotherapy. In a US open label study of 22 biochemical non-responders (ALP persistently >2 x ULN), only a very minimal 
additional benefit of budesonide to UDCA was reported, with a 
significant increase in the Mayo PBC score prognostic index and 
significant deterioration in bone mineral density; true comparison is challenging, however, because this cohort may have had 
patients at later stages of disease.161 Most notably, a phase III 
double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial evaluating 
UDCA+budesonide vs UDCA +placebo awaits reporting (Eudra 
CT number 2007-004040-70).

leading to bile acid synthesis.162 It is important for practising 
clinicians to take clinical note that, while there is long-standing 
interest regarding these agents in cholestatic liver disease, in 
the UK drug labelling has documented contraindication to their 
use in PBC because of concerns over reported hepatotoxicity. 
Fibrates at high dose inhibit some CYP enzymes, in particular 
CYP2C9. At therapeutic doses, fibric acid derivatives increase 
serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and AST levels which may 
relate to known transcriptional effects on liver transaminase 
synthesis. For creatinine elevations it may also be that hyperproduction from muscle occurs, and concern over nephrotoxicity requires ongoing investigation and caution. Other adverse 
effects are recognised: 5–10% of patients, mostly with bezafibrate, develop musculoskeletal pain.
Studies from the 1990s evaluated the use of bezafibrate 
(400mg/day) as an adjunctive therapy to UDCA, in which 
normalisation of serum ALP was reported in ~45% of UDCA 
non-responders versus ~18% taking placebo.163 More recently, 
a non-blinded prospective randomised controlled study (n=27; 
100–120 months of treatment) reported that serum ALP 
levels were significantly lower following combination therapy 
(UDCA+bezafibrate) and associated with a trend toward 
improved overall survival (log rank P=0.057).164 Data from an 
open-label study (n=28) also provide evidence of a significant 
improvement in itch severity with bezafibrate, wherein all 12 
patients who reported itch prior to starting treatment achieved 
complete or partial symptom resolution.165 Moreover, 20 and 24 
UDCA non-responders attained a serum ALP reduction >40% 
within 6 and 12 months, respectively, with combination bezafibrate therapy.
Improvements in serum ALP is also evident through pilot 
studies using fenofibrate+UDCAcombination therapy, with 
a pooled complete biochemical response rate evident in 69% 
of patients according to one systematic review and meta-analysis.166 167 In a retrospective uncontrolled study, improvements 
in short-term, liver decompensation-free and transplant-free 
survival using combination UDCA+fenofibrate therapy independently of liver biochemical changes and across a cohort of 
120 prior UDCA non-responders (P<0.001) were described.168
However, concern remains about patient ascertainment, and 
deterioration of some patients with rising bilirubin values.
The biochemical improvements associated with fibric acid 
derivatives have not been shown to sufficiently alter long-term 
probability of liver-related death or need for transplantation 
when stratified according to the UK-PBC risk score,169 and may 
be counterbalanced by a possible negative impact on renal function.164 As such, meta-analysis of existing bezafibrate randomised 
clinical trials show no significant improvement in patient 
survival compared with UDCA monotherapy,170 although liver 
transplantation and liver-related death were not presented as 
clinical endpoints. Peer-reviewed results from a phase III clinical 
trial of bezafibrate in PBC (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/
NCT01654731) are, however, awaited.
Symptom management
The symptoms associated with PBC are important and have a 
significant impact on life quality for patients.171 Data from the 
UK-PBC patient cohort have shown that there is significant 
variation in management between centres and individual clinicians.12 It is hoped that these guidelines will help standardise 
the approach to symptom management by clinicians. It is our 
expert opinion that screening for the presence of symptoms 
by asking about them specifically, followed by offering formal 
quantification of their impact in patients reporting their presence, can be helpful in understanding the impact on individual 
patients (approaches can include Likert or visual analogue scales, 
which are well established for itch particularly and the use of 
more complex patient-derived measures such as the multi-domain PBC-40 QoL measure172 173). Therapies for symptoms 
should be continuously evaluated rather than on an ad hoc 
basis, and it is important to re-evaluate symptoms and response 
to therapy. There is also a risk of recurring symptoms on stopping therapy and most patients require treatment long term. The 
symptoms of PBC typically do not correlate with disease severity 
and do not improve with UDCA therapy.12
Recommendat ion 20
We recommend all patients should be evaluated for the presence 
of symptoms, particularly fatigue and itch. Clinicians should 
recognise that the severity of symptoms does not correlate with 
stage of disease. (Strong; Moderate)
Pruritus
Pruritus is one of the characteristic cholestatic symptoms in PBC 
and results in impaired health-related quality of life (HRQoL).174
Approximately 80% of patients experience pruritus at some time 
during the course of their disease.175 It can occur at any stage 
of the disease process, but it is important to note that itch can 
improve as liver disease worsens.64 Patients with the ductopenic 
variant of PBC have particular problems with itch.127 Follow-up 
of patients and evaluation of change in pruritus and potential 
side effects is appropriate when changes are made in anti-pruritic 
therapy.
Bile duct obstruction must be excluded as the cause of 
pruritus, given the increased risk of gallstone disease in PBC,176
although in practice this distinction is rarely problematic. Bile 
sequestrants are used as first-line therapy but tolerability is often 
an issue with side effects including bloating and constipation.177
Cholestyramine is a non-absorbable resin that may help relieve 
pruritus. It is important to note that bile sequestrants must be 
given 2–4hours before or after other medications (in particular 
UDCA) as they interfere with intestinal absorption.178 Patient 
education is important here (by clinicians and pharmacists) to 
avoid drug interactions. There is limited evidence to suggest that 
UDCA has any effect on pruritus.12 179 Colesevelam is a newer, 
often better tolerated, bile sequestrant which may have a role in 
management given the better side effect profile compared with 
cholestyramine. Despite clinicians describing anecdotal experience of benefit, and significant decreases in serum bile acid 
levels, a recent placebo-controlled trial failed to demonstrate 
effectiveness.180
Rifampicin is a useful second-line agent probably acting 
through its pregnane X receptor (PXR) agonist function.181
Several prospective randomised placebo-controlled trials have 
shown rifampicin to be effective in the management of cholestatic pruritus.182–185 This effect has been confirmed in meta-analyses.186 187 There are concerns over potential side effects with 
rifampicin (including hepatotoxicity and haemolysis), so patients 
commenced on treatment need regular blood tests.188 It is also 
important to remember that rifampicin affects vitamin K metabolism and can lead to an increase in the international normalised 
ratio (INR), most notably in icteric patients.189 Additionally, 
appropriate consideration should be given to balancing benefits 
against risks of antimicrobial resistance.

sensation of itching and scratching activity.186 190–192 Naltrexone 
should be started at a low dose to avoid opiate withdrawal-like 
reactions in the first few days of treatment.193 Long-term tolerability can be an issue, with many patients having ongoing opiate 
withdrawal-like reactions or reduced threshold to pain.194 195
Other drugs which are used empirically in the management 
of cholestatic itch, typically in patients with pruritus unresponsive to other agents, are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors 
(SSRIs; eg, sertraline) and gabapentin. SSRIs presumably act 
via altering the concentrations of neurotransmitters within the 
central nervous system. There are some reports of efficacy in the 
literature, but only a single small placebo-controlled trial.196 Side 
effects of SSRIs include dry mouth and patients should be warned 
about this. Gabapentin has been suggested as a potential treatment due to the theoretical benefit of increasing the threshold 
to experience nociception. However, a small trial failed to show 
benefit over placebo.197 Further evaluation of gabapentin may 
be warranted given the clinical experience. Antihistamines sometimes have a non-specific anti-pruritic effect which may be due 
to their sedative properties but are not recommended as specific 
therapy; they are, however, useful adjuncts for some. Table 2
shows an approach to the treatment of cholestatic pruritus.
Cholestatic pruritus is an area of active research with a 
number of experimental agents and approaches under development and evaluation. Trials of novel agents, including bile acid 
reuptake inhibitors and drugs targeting the autotaxin/lysophosphatidic acid pathway recently implicated in cholestatic pruritus, 
are ongoing or in development.181 198 New therapies are likely 
to emerge in the near future but need evaluation in a clinical 
setting. Physical approaches, such as nasobiliary drainage,181 199
MARS (molecular absorbance recirculating system) and ultraviolet (UV) light therapy are all experimental with case reports/
series showing benefit but no formal trial evaluation.200 201
UV light therapy is relatively easy to access in comparison to 
the other treatments. Nasobiliary drainage appears to provide 
transient relief of itching but requires repeated treatments, is 
technically complicated and is difficult to tolerate; pancreatitis 
is recognised as a potentially significant complication. These 
techniques require further investigation. In extreme situations, 
temporary relief has been obtained with plasmapheresis or

Liver transplantation for cholestatic pruritus is highly effective in terms of rapid reduction in pruritus severity (frequently 
within the first 24hours of transplantation).204 Pruritus that is 
‘persistent and intractable’ after therapeutic trials is one of the 
variant syndromes which are indications for liver transplantation 
according to current guidelines.
Recommendat ion 21
We recommend, given the safety profile of bile acid resins, 
that cholestyramine remains the first-line therapy for pruritus 
and should be taken separately to UDCA to avoid interaction. 
(Strong; Low)
Recommendat ion 22
We recommend that rifampicin can be a safe and effective secondline therapy for pruritus; prescribers must, however, evaluate the 
risks and benefits of use and ensure appropriate monitoring for 
side effects. (Strong; Moderate)
Fatigue
Although fatigue is not specific to PBC, it is frequently reported 
by patients (over 50%) and when severe, as it is in 20% of 
patients, is a significant cause of QoL impairment.12 171 205–208
There are peripheral and central components to it, with central 
fatigue frequently associated with cognitive impairment (poor 
memory and concentration) which can be mistaken for HE.209 210
Fatigue is, with the exception of very endstage patients where it 
is the norm,211 not related to severity of liver disease and is not 
responsive to UDCA therapy.12 The approach to fatigue and its 
management therefore needs to run, as is the case for pruritus, in 
parallel with the management of the underlying disease process. 
Post-transplant patients with PBC typically have ongoing fatigue, 
and transplant for severe fatigue in the absence of other indications is not appropriate.12 211 High quality clinical trials in this 
area have been limited to date, and there is no licensed therapy. 
Fatigue in PBC as in other chronic diseases is inherently complex 
in nature and a structured approach to it is essential if improvement is to be seen.212 A structured approach to management, 
quantifying fatigue and its impacts (through the use of tools 
such as the PBC-40 QoL measure), addressing contributing and 
exacerbating factors and supporting patients to cope with its 
impact has been shown to be effective.212 It is important, when 
addressing fatigue, to identify other disease processes and therapies linked to PBC either directly or indirectly which may be 
contributing to fatigue. These include other autoimmune conditions such as hypothyroidism or autoimmune anaemias and 
demography-associated conditions and therapies such as type 2

diabetes and antihypertensive therapy.38 The steps to management of fatigue in PBC, which should be taken sequentially, are 
outlined in table 3. There is no evidence to suggest that exercise 
is harmful in PBC fatigue. Indeed, there are pilot data to suggest 
that structured exercise initiated at levels which can be tolerated 
by fatigued patients may be beneficial.213
Recommendat ion 23
We recommend that alternative causes of fatigue should be 
sought and treated. (Strong; Moderate)
Sicca complex
Sicca complex is common in PBC, with symptoms of dry eyes 
and/or dry mouth frequently seen in patients.38 214 Most patients 
have sicca symptoms rather than primary Sjögren’s syndrome. 
Other symptoms may include dysphagia and vaginal dryness. 
Clinicians should specifically enquire about these symptoms. 
Artificial tears and saliva are often helpful. Pilocarpine or cevimeline (muscarinic receptor agonists) can be used if symptoms are 
refractory.215 216 Patients with severe xerostomia should be given 
oral hygiene advice to prevent the development of dental caries. 
Clinicians should also be vigilant of the risk of oral candidiasis 
in patients with severe xerostomia. Vaginal moisturisers may be 
helpful but the use of oestrogen creams should be directed in 
primary care or by a gynaecologist (there are no concerns from a 
hepatology perspective). Specific guidelines for the management 
of sicca symptoms and Sjögren’s syndrome should be consulted 
for further details.217 If serological positivity (anti-Ro/La) or 
extraglandular features are found, evaluation for multisystem 
disease associated with Sjögrens disease by an expert clinician 
may be appropriate. Further patients with refractory symptoms 
should also be referred for specialist management, as evolving 
new therapies may be available.
Miscellaneous
Up to one-quarter of patients with PBC have Raynaud’s 
phenomenon which occurs due to spasmodic arterial contraction in the extremities (usually fingers and toes, but sometimes 
ears and nose).38 Patients should be asked specifically about 
the classical symptoms of their extremities turning white, then 
blue and finally red, often associated with pain/burning/tingling 
when the blood flow returns. Practical measures, such as wearing 
gloves, using hand warmers and avoiding cold environments, are 
often all that are needed for mild symptoms. For more marked 
symptoms, vasodilators such as calcium channel blockers can 
be used.218 Specialist rheumatological advice should be sought 
for severe symptoms and those at risk of digital ulceration. 
Approximately 8% of patients with PBC have limited scleroderma (CREST syndrome: Calcinosis, Raynaud’s phenomenon, 
oEsophageal dysmotility, Sclerodactyly, Telangiectasia).38 These 
symptoms and signs should be sought and, if present, patients 
should be referred for rheumatology advice. Social isolation, 
fatigue, anxiety and depression are important predictors of 
poor perceived QoL in PBC.219 Primary care providers should 
consider assessing patients for features of depression and, where 
appropriate, a trial of antidepressants may be helpful.
Recommendat ion 24
We suggest that patients with symptoms resistant to medical 
therapy should be referred for specialist management regardless 
of disease severity. (Weak; Moderate)
How to manage the clinical needs of a patient with PBC and 
advanced liver disease
Patients with decompensated liver disease are easy to recognise, 
allowing institution of appropriate management. It can be more 
difficult, however, to identify patients with PBC with well-compensated cirrhosis and even liver biopsy can be falsely reassuring 
due to the patchy nature of disease severity within the liver. 
There are no defined cut-offs and it is an assessment of relative 
risk which allows clinicians to decide when a patient requires 
screening for the complications of cirrhosis.
A practical approaching to identifying cirrhosis in clinical practice is to consider cirrhosis as defined by either confirmation by 
liver biopsy or on the basis of radiological findings (nodular liver 
with enlarged spleen) with either a history of complications of 
liver disease (ascites, variceal bleeding, encephalopathy, pervious 
bacterial peritonitis) or supportive laboratory findings (low 
platelets, low albumin, prolonged prothrombin time or INR). 
Liver stiffness measurement (LSM), assessed by vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE), has been shown as one 
of the best surrogate markers for the detection of cirrhosis or 
severe fibrosis (ie, bridging fibrosis) in patients with PBC.107 220
With increasingly greater access to VCTE now occurring across 
secondary and tertiary care, many clinicians now use VCTE as an 
adjunctive tool to help establish whether a patient has significant 
underlying liver fibrosis/cirrhosis; the results must, however, 
be interpreted in the clinical context of the patient. In one 
study, diagnostic thresholds of liver stiffness in discriminating

Autonomic dysfunction
Strongly associated with fatigue and in vasomotor forms 
can cause significant falls; volume repletion and assessment 
(through 24 hours blood pressure (BP) monitoring and, where 
appropriate, tilt testing) and adjustment of inappropriate 
antihypertensive therapy can be helpful
Sleep disturbance
Daytime somnolence can be strongly associated with fatigue; 
assessment and treatment for obstructive sleep apneoa can 
be beneficial; case series of the use of modafinil for severe 
daytime somnolence in PBC with improvement in linked 
fatigue
Assist with effecting 
lifestyle adjustments 
and developing 
coping mechanisms
Patients need to be advised and supported to develop coping 
strategies while retaining ownership of the problem. Pacing 
strategies (using available energy to its best advantage) and 
timing strategies (fatigue is worse later in the day typically 
so arranging key tasks for earlier in the day can make them 
more achievable) are recommended
Support Fatigue in PBC can reduce life quality. Awareness and 
understanding from carers is helpful in developing positive 
patient attitudes and coping strategies

Guidelines
fibrosis stages ≥F1, ≥F2 ,≥F3 and=F4 were 7.1, 8.8, 10.7 and 
16.9kPa, respectively.107 One large collaborative study showed 
LSM and IQR/median as the two independent criteria of VCTE 
reliability221; EASL-Asociación Latinoamericana para el Estudio 
del Hígado (ALEH) clinical practice guidelines provide current 
recommendations on performing VCTE, and clinical interpretation of LSM measurements should account for whether such 
recommendations are implemented locally—for example, in 
particular time of VCTE and whether the patient is fasting.222
As a result, a combination of clinical markers are used 
including:
1. Evidence of portal hypertension: thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly and/or varices
2. Histology: biopsy-proven cirrhosis
3. Predictive formulae: for example, Newcastle Varices Score
4. Imaging: ultrasound, cross-sectional evidence of cirrhotic liver/splenomegaly or TE
5. Serum markers of fibrosis: for example, ELF test
In terms of monitoring patients for the development of 
advanced disease, those who are non-responders to treatment 
who did not have advanced disease at presentation should have 
life-long follow-up and annual monitoring for evidence of 
progression (eg, ultrasound, TE (evidence not clear but accumulating),106 107 223 routine blood tests).105 Those patients with mild 
disease and near normal liver biochemistry tests do not require 
this intensity of follow-up and should have yearly LFTs.
Once a patient with cirrhosis has been identified or the clinical 
decision has been taken to monitor as if cirrhotic, they should be 
followed up in accordance with other relevant treatment guidelines for patients with cirrhosis.4 5 224–226 Clinical decompensation is, along with bilirubin >50µmol/L, a predictor of adverse 
outcome in PBC and such patients should be discussed with a 
hepatologist experienced in managing advanced disease and who 
is linked to a transplant programme.
Recommendat ion 25
We recommend that, in all patients with bilirubin >50 µmol/L 
(including those treated with UDCA) or evidence of decompensated liver disease, consideration should be made regarding 
suitability for liver transplantation through discussion with a 
hepatologist linked to a liver transplant programme. (Strong; 
High)
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
Patients with PBC who have cirrhosis are at increased risk 
of HCC as in other forms of chronic liver disease.227 228 The 
majority of HCC in patients with PBC occurs in those with 
cirrhosis, although there are reports of HCC in patients who are 
non-cirrhotic.229 There are some important factors which identify patients as being at increased risk (in addition to cirrhosis). 
Non-responders to treatment are at greater risk and men are 
more likely to get HCC than women in PBC (of note given that 
PBC is much less common in men).229 230 Screening should be 
undertaken in accordance with international guidelines.224–226
There is currently an absence of specific UK guidelines. International guidelines currently advise abdominal ultrasound at 
6-monthly intervals. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) has recently been 
removed from some international guidelines but is still widely 
used in clinical practice alongside abdominal ultrasound. The 
discussion of the health economics of HCC screening in PBC is 
outside the remit of these guidelines, but note should be taken of 
increasing locoregional therapies for HCC applicable to patients 
of all ages.
Recommendat ion 26
We recommend that, in patients where cirrhosis is suspected, 
HCC surveillance should be carried out according to NICE 
guidelines. (Strong; Moderate)
Portal hypertension
The incidence of varices in patients with PBC is significant, 
with approximately one-third of patients with advanced disease 
developing oesophageal varices over a median of 5.6 years.5
 At 
present, relevant guidelines for endoscopic screening do not risk 
stratify patients. All patients known to have PBC with cirrhosis 
require endoscopic screening according to prior guidelines.231–233
The possibility of occult cirrhosis should also be considered in all 
patients and factored into decisions about the appropriateness of 
endoscopic screening. Table 4 shows the various tools available 
to help identify patients at risk of varices and who might benefit 
from endoscopic screening. The Baveno VI guidelines use the 
term ‘compensated advanced chronic liver disease (cACLD)’ to 
reflect the spectrum of disease in asymptomatic patients and 
encourage the use of TE in clinical practice.231 Patients with a 
liver stiffness <20kPa and platelet count >150000 are at very 
low risk of having varices that require treatment, although it is 
acknowledged that patients with PBC were not well represented 
in the studies to date. Annual assessment using TE and platelet 
count should be considered. This approach may decrease the 
number of screening endoscopies required. These tools can be 
used to help decision making regarding which patients require 
endoscopic screening, but clinical concern about the presence 
should always be followed up with endoscopy.

Guidelines
It is important to note that patients with PBC can develop 
varices even in the absence of established cirrhosis, although 
in clinical practice pre-sinusoidal varices are relatively 
unusual.234–236 Non-cirrhotic portal hypertension can occur in 
PBC and the possibility of its presence should be considered in 
all PBC patients with a GI bleed.
Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) should 
be considered for patients with variceal bleeding that fails to 
respond to endoscopic or pharmacological therapy.237 238 Patients 
with portal hypertension may also develop ascites which should 
be managed according to current guidelines.233 239 240 TIPS has a 
role in the management of patients with refractory ascites, with 
a recent randomised controlled trial showing that covered TIPS 
stents increase the proportion of cirrhotic patients with recurrent ascites surviving transplantation-free for 1year compared 
with repeated large volume paracentesis.241 Portal hypertension 
in PBC often has a slowly progressive course and patients may 
do well with a TIPS.
Recommendat ion 27
We recommend that patients with suspected portal hypertension 
should be screened for gastro-oesophageal varices according to 
BSG guidelines. (Strong; Moderate)
Hepatic encephalopathy (HE)
HE can be the cause of significant life quality impairment in 
patients with advanced disease but is relatively unusual in PBC 
(and should not be mistaken for the much commoner cognitive 
impairment associated with fatigue). Where present, HE in PBC 
characteristically affects older patients. The first-line management is with lactulose (at a dose achieving 2–3 soft stools per 
day). Some patients may require regular enemas in addition to 
lactulose. In any patient with HE, it is important to rule out 
secondary causes such as constipation, dehydration, infection 
and upper GI bleeding. For patients with refractory encephalopathy, rifaximin is frequently used and is now NICE approved.242
Rifaximin is a non-absorbable antibiotic that improves HE, 
reduces hospital admission rates due to HE and the incidence of 
recurrent HE.243–245 It must be remembered that patients with 
HE cannot drive.
Recommendat ion 28
We recommend that ascites and hepatic encephalopathy should 
be treated as in standard practice. (Strong; Moderate)
Transplantation
Liver transplantation is an established and successful procedure 
that prolongs the life of patients with chronic liver disease and, 
in certain settings, improves their QoL as well. PBC was among 
the very early indications for liver transplantation and remains 
a strong disease indication for surgery.246 Liver transplantation, 
however, remains a challenging procedure and, in most settings, 
organ availability has a significant impact on determining the 
precise timing and indications for surgery.
In the UK, patients should have a clear indication for transplantation as well as, usually, a UKELD score of 49 or greater 
(ie, meet minimal listing criteria based on a biochemical marker 
of disease severity calculated using the latest bilirubin, INR, 
creatinine and sodium). Patients with certain variant indications 
are eligible for listing for transplantation in the absence of an 
elevated UKELD score, and for patients with PBC this may be 
relevant (pruritus in particular).247
The UKELD score is effective in risk stratification in the 
context of transplantation and most UK patients are listed for 
transplantation based on an elevated UKELD score with accompanying liver failure/end-stage liver disease (jaundice, ascites, 
encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, sarcopenia, HCC) that is not 
responsive to medical therapy. Fatigue in isolation is not an indication for transplantation. Intractable pruritus unresponsive to 
medical therapy is an indication for transplantation with good 
outcomes in terms of pruritus.
In practice it is optimal to ensure patients who may be potentially eligible for transplantation are referred early and/or 
discussed with centres linked to transplant programmes because 
this facilitates ready access to transplant services. In practice, in 
view of the varied nature and timescale for overt decompensation, clinicians should actively consider whether transplantation is the best treatment in any patient with advanced PBC as 
evidenced by a UKELD score >49, jaundice, portal hypertension 
or signs of early decompensation (eg, ascites, encephalopathy, 
sarcopenia).
Recurrent PBC (rPBC) post liver transplant is well recognised 
but clinically relevant for only a few.246 248 It can only be 
confirmed histologically given that many complications 
post-transplant (biliary, rejection, vascular) present with an 
elevated ALP, and serologic features of PBC persist post-transplant so are not additive diagnostically. Protocol liver biopsies 
are no longer commonly performed and there may be minor 
changes in liver biochemistry that are not histologically evaluated in patients, therefore the rate of rPBC is an estimate in the 
literature but is at least ~20% by 10 years. Across studies the 
reported prevalence rate of rPBC, however, ranges from 0% to 
35%. The median time to rPBC ranges between 3 and 5.5 years. 
Graft loss is possible with rPBC but rare (~1%), and recurrent 
disease can occur in a second graft. Seemingly, the use of tacrolimus is associated with increased risk of PBC recurrence in the 
allograft, and some have advocated cyclosporine in patients 
with PBC as a result249; the low clinical relevance of rPBC has, 
however, meant that practice has not changed. Others have 
proposed all patients are routinely given UDCA post-transplant, 
but no consensus exists on this248; however, there are recent data 
supporting UDCA as preventing recurrence. No overwhelming 
evidence for particular immunosuppressive strategies exist; in 
particular, there is no evidence to support long-term prednisolone, although in the early post-transplant period a slightly 
higher rate of acute rejection can be expected.
Recommendat ion 29
We recommend that liver transplantation can be an effective 
treatment for advanced PBC and eligibility should be assessed in 
line with national guidelines. (Strong; Moderate)
Recommendat ion 30
We recommend that pruritus refractory to all medical therapy 
can be an indication for liver transplantation in highly selected

Guidelines
with chronic cholestasis, particularly once individuals become 
jaundiced.250 251 Routine measurement of vitamin levels is not 
usually additive or necessary but, in patients with advanced 
icteric disease, consideration should be given to oral supplementation of vitamins A, D, E and K using standard preparations.
Osteoporosis
Osteoporosis affects 20–44% of patients with PBC with the 
resultant risk of fragility fractures, while the majority of patients 
have osteopenia.111 Risk factors for osteopenic bone disease in 
PBC include female gender, menopausal status, low body mass 
index (through the effects of disordered bile acid homeostasis 
and the pancreatic insufficiency seen in some patients with PBC), 
older age, advanced disease and chronic cholestasis with resultant vitamin D deficiency.112 Patients with PBC also have higher 
markers of bone resorption (urinary hydroxyproline) and lower 
markers of bone formation (osteocalcin).112
Patients should be given general lifestyle advice to prevent 
loss of bone density (weight-bearing exercise, smoking cessation, 
minimising alcohol intake, etc). Falls are seen with increased 
frequency in PBC due to associated autonomic dysfunction and 
add to the increased fracture risk presented by osteoporosis.252
Patients with a clinical history of falls should be referred to a 
specialist falls clinic for multidisciplinary assessment, including 
for the presence of autonomic dysfunction.252
All patients with cirrhosis and those with other recognised risk 
factors (eg, female gender, post-menopausal women, low body 
mass index, older age) should be assessed for osteoporosis and 
fracture risk. The FRAX score (the WHO fracture risk assessment tool can be used with or without bone mineral density 
(BMD) values) or QFracture (BMD values cannot be incorporated into the risk algorithm) should be used to estimate 10-year 
predicted absolute fracture risk. Following risk assessment with 
FRAX (without a BMD value) or QFracture, consider measuring 
BMD with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in people 
whose fracture risk is in the region of an intervention threshold 
and recalculate absolute risk using FRAX with the BMD value.253
National guidelines should be referred to for treatment algorithms.253 Vitamin D deficiency should be corrected and an 
adequate dietary intake assured. The use of calcium alongside 
vitamin D supplementation depends on the adequacy of dietary 
intake. If a bisphosphonate is required, alendronic acid is usually 
used first line.254–257 Specialist referral should be considered for 
patients who are unable to tolerate alendronate or risedronate. 
Treatment options include strontium ranelate, raloxifene, denosumab and teriparatide. There is a widely held view that oral 
bisphosphonates are unsafe in patients with varices because of 
the risk of superficial erosion and enhanced bleeding risk. The 
evidence to support this view is limited. Intravenous bisphosphonates can be used if there is clinical concern. There are limited 
data regarding the use of hormone replacement therapy and its 
efficacy in osteoporosis prevention in PBC.258 259
Recommendat ion 32
We recommend that all patients with PBC should have a risk 
assessment for osteoporosis. Treatment and follow-up should be 
according to national guidelines. (Strong; High)
When should patients be considered for clinical trials?
For many years following the original UDCA trials there has 
been little or no trials activity in PBC. This is now changing with 
a number of trials targeting areas of perceived unmet clinic need 
in the condition,260 261 with progress to new licensed second-line 
therapies such as OCA,158 which has FDA and EMA approval, 
as well as NICE evaluation in the UK. Currently there are trials 
in three distinct areas and patients should be offered the opportunity to participate if they fall into targeted groups (see https://
clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=primary+biliary+cirrhosis+
OR+primary+biliary+cholangitis&Search=Search).
High-risk/UDCA-unresponsive disease
The significantly worse clinical outcome seen in patients showing 
an inadequate response to UDCA has focused interest on trials 
of enhanced or second-line therapy. Trials currently under development target two aspects of the disease process—namely, the 
upstream autoimmune response causing initial bile duct injury 
(typically but not exclusively using second-generation biological-based approaches) and the cycle of cholestatic injury (using 
second-line bile acid-targeting therapeutics such as FXR agonists 
that suppress bile acid production and fibrates, which have anecdotal evidence but as yet no randomised placebo-controlled 
data). The standard approach in current and proposed enhanced 
disease therapy trials is to target patients not meeting UDCA 
response criteria at the end of 1year of treatment at 13–15mg/
kg/day (or who are intolerant of UDCA) and any patient failing 
to meet this criterion should be considered for participation in 
ongoing trials of second-line or enhanced therapy.
Pruritus resistant to current therapy
Current and proposed trials are targeting resistant pruritus 
including through breaking of the enterohepatic circulation for 
bile acids and, it is proposed, targeting the autotoxin pathway. 
Protocols vary, but typically target patients with significant 
residual pruritus (defined in terms of severity and/or frequency) 
following first and established second-line therapy or who are 
intolerant of current therapy, and should therefore be considered for participation in clinical trials.
Fatigue
Trials targeting fatigue are complex, reflecting the nature 
of the clinical problem.262 They form part of the management approach undertaken in specialist centres and patients 
with severe fatigue should be considered for referral to such 
centres. Critical for trials of fatigue in PBC is the need to 
exclude confounding causes, and the systematic approach to 
addressing such confounding processes outlined elsewhere in 
these guidelines should be followed before trial participation 
is considered.
Management of special populations
Variant presentations of PBC
The classical presentation of PBC is in a woman with the combination of cholestatic LFTs and positive AMA, with or without 
the systemic symptoms of PBC. Important variants are seen in 
the clinic:
1. AMA-negative (AMA −ve) PBC: Approximately 5% of patients with PBC are negative for AMA (or anti PDC-E2/M2 
by ELISA), although this figure in practice reflects the assays 
employed.263 264 The majority of these patients will be positive for the PBC-specific nuclear antibodies.265 Such antibodies are equivalent to AMA in terms of diagnostic accuracy for 
PBC and AMA −ve, ANA +ve patients do not need biopsy 
for diagnostic confirmation. True autoantibody-negative PBC 
cannot be diagnosed without biopsy. In terms of management, AMA −ve disease should be treated in the same way as 
AMA +ve. There are data to suggest that ANA +ve patients

Guidelines
progress more rapidly.76 At present this information does not 
influence therapy decisions, although this may change in the 
future with the development of stratified treatment models.
2. AMA +ve with normal LFTs: Up to 0.5% of the population 
in screening studies are found to be AMA +ve with, typically, 50% of those having normal liver biochemistry.266 Earlier 
studies suggested that over prolonged follow-up the majority 
of patients with AMA and normal LFTs seen in the formal 
clinical setting went on to develop typical PBC biochemical abnormality and symptoms, although the relevance of 
this to the broader AMA +vepopulation is unclear.84 Over 
18 years of follow-up, however, none developed cirrhosis, 
needed transplant or died of PBC.267 Individuals found to be 
AMA +ve with normal LFTs should be screened every year 
for biochemical abnormality development and then treated 
as for classical PBC if such abnormality is seen. This follow-up can take place in primary care unless there are specific individual factors such as associated autoimmune disease 
warranting secondary care follow-up. With the background 
rate of AMA reactivity in blood donors reaching 1 in 200 in 
some studies, and the rising prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty 
liver disease, it is also inevitable that AMA reactivity will be 
identified in patients clinically most likely to have metabolic 
liver disease. As noted already, such patients may need liver 
biopsy to identify the dominant liver injury, particularly as 
an elevation in ALP alone can also be found in patients with 
NAFLD.
3. PBC/AIH overlap syndromes: A small minority of patients 
with PBC can also have simultaneous AIH features. The 
management of this group is discussed in detail below.
4. AMA +ve AIH: A small minority of patients with AIH are 
AMA +ve, typically in the context of other AIH-characteristic 
autoantibodies.268 269 Such cases do not usually present a diagnostic challenge because of the presence of a biochemical 
pattern characteristic of AIH rather than PBC (ALT/AST and 
IgG elevation rather than ALP and IgM). AMA +ve AIH 
should be treated as for AMA −ve AIH.
Overlap syndromes
A small proportion of patients with PBC also exhibit some or 
all of the clinical features of AIH. The nature of such ‘overlap’ 
syndromes, the criteria for their diagnosis and the optimal 
approach to treatment has been a source of debate for a number of 
years.270 271 PBC/AIH overlap is best not considered as a distinct 
pathological entity, but rather the reflection of an inherent distribution of clinical features across patient populations presenting 
with autoimmune liver disease. There have been only a small 
number of reported putative cases of overlap between PBC and 
PSC. The critical question is how does the possibility of overlap 
impact on clinical management? The key distinction is between 
‘true’ overlap, where patients are exhibiting definitive features of 
both conditions, and situations where patients with PBC exhibit 
features more typically associated with AIH but which fall short 
of classical diagnostic criteria. The importance of this distinction 
has been increased by the emerging data suggesting that clinical 
features which might be superficially suggestive of AIH (elevated 
serum aminotransferase activity and interface hepatitis on liver 
biopsy) are in fact also strongly associated with aggressive PBC, 
predicting both poor outcome and UDCA non-response.
Criteria have been proposed by the Paris group for ‘true’ PBC/
AIH overlap,272 with two out of three of (a) ALT>5 x ULN, 
(b) IgG >2 x ULN or positive anti-SMA and (c) liver biopsy 
with ‘moderate or severe periportal or periseptal lymphocytic 
piecemeal necrosis (interface hepatitis)’ being suggested as diagnostic of overlap in the context of a PBC diagnosis. Although a 
diagnosis of PBC/AIH overlap syndrome could theoretically be 
made without a liver biopsy, uncertainty about establishing the 
diagnosis means that liver biopsy is still recommended in this 
situation.273
The International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group (IAIHG) 
does not recommend the use of their criteria, which were developed to identify AIH in isolation not in conjunction with other 
autoimmune liver conditions, for the diagnosis of overlap.273
Based on robust diagnostic criteria, such as the Paris criteria, true 
PBC/AIH overlap is uncommon (<2% of Caucasian patients),274
although there may be differences between different ethnic 
groups in keeping with ethnic differences in autoimmune disease 
risk.36 275 Where present, however, the outcome may be worse 
than for classical PBC, with increased risk of the development 
of complications.276 Given the poorer outcome associated with 
the presence of overlap identified using definitive criteria, treatment augmentation should be considered, with a combination 
of approaches used to treat both disease elements. Meta-analysis 
supports the use of combination of immunosuppressive therapy 
and UDCA in patients with true overlap, but the challenges 
of disease classification impact directly on the value of such 
meta-analyses per se.170 There is evidence to support the use 
of budesonide in combination with UDCA, an approach which 
improves survival in comparison to UDCA monotherapy and is 
associated with fewer side effects than other immunosuppressive regimes.170 Caution must be applied, however, when using 
budesonide in patients potentially with cirrhosis/portosystemic 
shunts. Evidence is lacking as to how to approach long-term 
maintenance therapy in overlap patients stepping down from 
corticosteroids. It would be reasonable, however, to extrapolate 
from management regimes for pure AIH with the use of azathioprine (used in conjunction with long-term UDCA).
Patients with parameters diagnostic of PBC or AIH, and associated non-diagnostic features of a second condition, should 
be treated for the predominant disease in the first instance (in 
PBC predominant disease with UDCA at 13–15mg/kg) and the 
response to therapy assessed,273 the rationale being the fact that 
such AIH-like features are also characteristic of UDCA non-responsive PBC. It is likely that the emerging second-line bile acid 
therapeutic agents will become the recommended agents for use 
in such patients following failure to respond to UDCA.
Recommendat ion 33
True overlap with AIH is probably rare and we suggest that, 
when suspected, liver biopsy with expert clinicopathological 
review is needed to make the diagnosis and guide treatment. 
(Strong; Moderate)
Recommendat ion 34
We suggest that biochemical evidence of marked hepatitic activity 
(transaminases >5x ULN), alongside elevated IgG concentrations, are most relevant in considering who should have a liver 
biopsy. (Weak; Moderate)
Recommendat ion 35
We suggest that the presence of severe interface hepatitis in the 
correct context is usually required to initiate immunosuppression after the risks and benefits of treatment, particularly with 
corticosteroids, have been discussed with the patient. (Weak;

Guidelines
Pregnancy and PBC
While most patients are diagnosed at an age when pregnancy is 
not a relevant consideration, a significant minority of patients 
with PBC are women of reproductive age. In this younger age 
range of PBC, pregnancy may either be a reason for diagnosis 
(failure of resolution of obstetric cholestasis) or may be complicated by worsening pruritus. Significant medical risks are infrequent but can be relevant if patients have cirrhosis and portal 
hypertension. In this setting, management is no different from 
any other aetiology of cirrhosis (eg, gastroscopy if concern over 
portal hypertension; exclusion of splenic artery aneurysm by 
ultrasound).
PBC specific experience is limited to case series, but expert 
clinical opinion is that UDCA is safe during conception, pregnancy and post-partum.277 Additionally, cholestyramine and 
rifampicin (second trimester onwards) are considered safe 
in pregnancy, although the data are limited.155 278 Rarely, itch 
during pregnancy becomes unbearable and plasmapheresis may 
help.279 In those with notable cholestasis, fat-soluble vitamin 
deficiency should be avoided. Post-partum cholestatic flares have 
been described and clinical follow-up in the post-partum period 
is important.
Pre-pregnancy counselling should be pragmatic; recognition 
that in those with a marked ductopenic variant of PBC, disease 
progression from intense added cholestasis during pregnancy 
does need consideration. Similarly, patients with portal hypertension have the greatest risks associated with pregnancy and 
should be appropriately counselled. Variceal bleeding can occur 
in patients with cirrhosis of any aetiology as a consequence of 
pregnancy-related increase in portal pressure. Such patients 
should be electively endoscoped in the second trimester and 
managed appropriately. Pregnant patients with PBC should be 
screened for anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies, as their presence 
would change obstetric practice regarding fetal screening for 
bradycardia.
Recommendat ion 36
Pregnancy is typically well tolerated in non-cirrhotic patients 
with PBC, but pruritus can be exacerbated. We recommend 
specialist advice as appropriate for pregnant patients with PBC, 
including guidance over use of UDCA and treatment of pruritus. 
While data regarding UDCA in pregnancy are limited, we recommend that expert practice is to continue use peri-conception, 
peri-partum and post-partum. (Strong; Moderate)
Recommendat ion 37
Pregnancy in patients with cirrhosis carries a higher risk of 
maternal and fetal complications. We recommend patients with 
features to suggest advanced liver disease have pre-conception 
counselling and subsequent interdisciplinary specialist monitoring during pregnancy. (Strong; Moderate).
Familial screening
Awareness of the increased risk of PBC seen in the first-degree 
relatives of patients with PBC and the role played by genetic 
factors in disease pathogenesis can give rise to anxiety among 
patients with regard to the risk that their relatives run of developing the condition. There can be particular concern in the 
daughters of mothers with PBC because of the female predominance of the disease. Screening for any disease must balance any 
benefit resulting from earlier diagnosis of the condition against 
the individual and healthcare costs associated with the screening 
activity. In the case of PBC, the sibling relative risk is 10 (siblings 
of a patient with PBC have a 10.5-fold higher risk of developing 
the disease than age- and sex-matched community controls), 
while the relative risk rises to 35 for the daughters of patients 
with PBC.37 The prevalence of PBC in the UK population has 
been estimated as being 350/million (700/million women), 
giving a prevalence for PBC among the daughters of mothers 
with the disease of ~2%. Given the low likelihood of screening 
being positive, the lack of time-dependent therapy where early 
diagnosis materially alters the nature of therapy, and anecdotal 
reports of people being screened for PBC subsequently having 
difficulty getting life and travel insurance, formal screening for 
PBC in relatives of patients is not recommended. Patient anxiety, 
however, needs to be taken into account and may be a relevant 
factor to consider in deciding about ad hoc familial screening.
Recommendat ion 38
We recommend that the relatives of patients with PBC do not 
need to be routinely screened for PBC. (Strong; Moderate).
Patient support and patient education
NICE recommends in the guideline ‘Patient Experience in Adult 
NHS Services: Improving the Experience of Care for People 
Using Adult NHS services’ that clear, consistent, evidencebased, tailored information is available to patients throughout 
all stages of their care.225 In PBC, evidence exists from qualitative research to show that factors such as knowledge, information, consistency, a positive approach, simplification and 
repetition lead to a positive diagnosis experience.280 Findings 
were used to develop a patient information DVD with expert 
clinicians describing PBC and patients talking about their experiences. This DVD allows consistent evidence-based information to be provided to patients. It is available to patients and 
professionals by contacting the patient charity LIVErNORTH 
(info@livernorth.org.uk; http://www.livernorth.org.uk/pages/
factsheet.htm#DVD). Answers to some frequently encountered 
concerns over PBC care are shown in box 1 and table 5. NICE 
(https://www.nice.org.uk) also recommends that patients are 
given both oral and written information. Leaflets are available 
from a number of national and local patient support groups and 
are written by clinicians with patient input (The British Liver 
Trust, The PBC Foundation and LIVErNorth). Leaflets can be 
obtained by contacting UK-PBC via the website (http://www.ukpbc.com/). Leaflets should be made readily available to patients.
Box 1 Situations to consider consultation with a centre 
hosting a specialist hepatology programme
► Disease unresponsive or under-responsive to UDCA

of progressive disease
► Approaching need for consideration of liver transplantation

Guidelines
The use of international web sites by patients is not recommended as the clinical practice described may differ from that in 
the UK, causing confusion.
Fatigue has been shown to be the symptom with the biggest 
impact on patients. Fatigued patients perceive a poor QoL 
compared with controls and their levels of social engagement 
are lower.171 219 Very little is written in relation to social isolation and improving support mechanisms in PBC, but there are 
a number of telephone helplines and patient support groups 
that offer free qualified peer support to patients. It is recommended (based on expert opinion) that details of helplines can 
be suggested to patients who may be at risk of social isolation.

There may be scope for psychological approaches, such as 
cognitive behavioural therapy, to be used to support patients 
with PBC. Such approaches have been found to be effective in 
other chronic conditions for managing distress resulting from 
debilitating symptoms. Blackburn et al explored the psychological impact of fatigue in PBC using semi-structured interviews 
and validated assessment tools for psychological symptoms. 
Patients with PBC who report high levels of fatigue were found 
to be more vulnerable to emotional distress and are more likely 
to perceive that their QoL has been negatively affected.281 We 
therefore advise that a patient with profound psychological 
distress associated with fatigue should be referred to appropriate 
psychological services for assessment.
Recommendat ion 39
We recommend that patients with PBC should be offered the 
chance to seek support from patient support groups. (Strong; 
Moderate).
Service standards/audit recommendat ions for PBC
Opportunities exist to implement the BSG/UK-PBC PBC guidelines into clinical practice through audit of current and future 
clinical care. We propose that the following service standards 
and targets be adopted by clinical teams caring for patients with 
PBC, with the goal being improved and more effective and 
uniform care for patients with PBC:
1. To exclude alternative aetiologies for cholestasis, all patients 
with suspected PBC should have an abdominal ultrasound as 
part of their baseline assessment (standard 90%).
2. All patients should be offered therapy with UDCA. UDCA at 
13–15mg/kg/day is recommended for first-line use in all patients with PBC (standard 90% of patients receiving therapy 
at adequate dose or documented to be intolerant).
3. To facilitate the identification of patients at risk of progressive disease, individualised risk stratification using biochemical response indices is recommended following 1year of 
UDCA therapy (standard 80% of patients receiving UDCA 
therapy to have their response status recorded in the notes 
and the criteria used recorded).
4. To highlight the impact on QoL and to ensure appropriate 
investigation and treatment, all patients should be evaluated 
for the presence of symptoms, particularly fatigue and itch 
(standard 90% of patients have the presence/absence of fatigue and pruritus recorded in the notes in the last year).
5. To maximise the opportunity for all patients to be considered 
in a timely way for liver transplantation, all patients with a 
bilirubin >50 µmol/L or evidence of decompensated liver 
disease should be discussed with a hepatologist linked to a 
Table 5 Frequently encountered clinical questions
Frequently asked 
questions Current opinion
Can patients with PBC 
take exercise?
It is perfectly safe to take exercise with PBC and in fact 
there is some pilot trial evidence that exercise therapy 
is helpful for the treatment of fatigue.213 Patients with 
PBC frequently lack confidence to undertake exercise so 
support can be useful291
Do patients with PBC 
need to follow a specific 
diet?
Expert opinion is that the vast majority of patients with 
early stage disease, and who are not overtly cholestatic, 
have no dietary problems and can eat a normal healthy 
diet. Where patients have cholestasis or one of the 
associated malabsorption syndromes, fat malabsorption 
can be an issue which can lead to nutritional problems.292
In this group, fat-soluble vitamin deficiency should be 
considered251 293
Should patients with PBC 
give up smoking?
General advice for health is to stop smoking. There is, 
however, also specific evidence in PBC to suggest that 
smoking is more prevalent,294 and may be associated with 
more aggressive disease.122 There is therefore a specific 
rationale for patients with PBC to avoid smoking
Can patients with PBC 
drink alcohol?
There is no evidence to support an association between 
either the development of PBC or disease severity, and 
expert opinion is therefore that there is no reason why 
patients with PBC cannot drink alcohol within accepted 
safe limits. Patients with advanced liver disease are 
however advised to abstain from alcohol
Are any drugs 
contraindicated in PBC?
As with any liver disease, expert opinion is that caution 
must always be applied in therapeutics; however, there 
are no specific concerns regarding drug toxicity in PBC 
per se
Is PBC associated with 
cancer risk?
This issue has been extensively looked at295 and the only 
malignancy associated with PBC is HCC in patients with 
advanced disease296 (with a particularly increased risk in 
UDCA non-responding patients and in male patients.297
Previous concerns regarding breast cancer risk have not 
been substantiated in well-designed studies298
Is PBC inherited? Daughters in particular of patients with PBC show a 
slightly increased risk of the disease, but this does not 
represent Mendelian inheritance.37 It is thought to 
represent either shared immunogenetic susceptibility or, 
potentially, shared exposure to environmental triggers. 
The lifetime risk of the daughter of a patient with PBC in 
the UK developing PBC is less than 1%, and on this basis 
screening is not routinely recommended
Is cardiac risk increased 
in PBC?
This has been extensively explored and there is no 
robust evidence to suggest that cardiac atherosclerotic 
risk is increased in PBC,299 300 despite the elevations 
in cholesterol seen in the disease. Patients with PBC 
do, however, have a normal level of cardiac risk 
and appropriate cardiac preventative screening and 
intervention is recommended. Differential cholesterol 
assessment is necessary because of the HDL 
hypercholesterolaemia of the condition and the smoking 
association is key
Is PBC transmissible to 
others?
No; although infectious agents have been postulated 
as triggers for disease, there is no evidence that shared 
exposure triggers disease and patients should be advised 
and reassured

discussion has taken place within 3 months of the bilirubin 
exceeding 50 µmol/ L and the actions taken recorded) 
6. To optimise prevention of osteoporotic bone fractures, all 
patients with PBC should have a risk assessment for osteoporosis. Treatment and follow-up should be according to 
national guidelines (standard 80% assessment within the last 
5 years).
7. To ensure timely but considered diagnosis and treatment, 
overlap with AIH should be recognised as rare and, when 
suspected, liver biopsy with expert clinicopathological assessment is recommended to make the diagnosis (standard 
90% of patients in whom the diagnosis of overlap is made 
having had liver biopsy confirmation and the clinicopathological assessment discussion noted).
Recommendat ion 40
We recommend that clinicians caring for patients with PBC 
should consider introducing clinical audit tools to document and 
improve the quality of care delivered to patients. (Strong; Low)
