ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVE
To delineate the clinical characteristics of patients 
with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) who died.
DESIGN
Retrospective case series.
SETTING
Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China.
PARTICIPANTS
Among a cohort of 799 patients, 113 who died and 
161 who recovered with a diagnosis of covid-19 were 
analysed. Data were collected until 28 February 2020.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Clinical characteristics and laboratory findings were 
obtained from electronic medical records with data 
collection forms.
RESULTS
The median age of deceased patients (68 years) 
was significantly older than recovered patients (51 
years). Male sex was more predominant in deceased 
patients (83; 73%) than in recovered patients (88; 
55%). Chronic hypertension and other cardiovascular 
comorbidities were more frequent among deceased 
patients (54 (48%) and 16 (14%)) than recovered 
patients (39 (24%) and 7 (4%)). Dyspnoea, chest 
tightness, and disorder of consciousness were 
more common in deceased patients (70 (62%), 55 
(49%), and 25 (22%)) than in recovered patients 
(50 (31%), 48 (30%), and 1 (1%)). The median time 
from disease onset to death in deceased patients 
was 16 (interquartile range 12.0-20.0) days. 
Leukocytosis was present in 56 (50%) patients who 
died and 6 (4%) who recovered, and lymphopenia 
was present in 103 (91%) and 76 (47%) respectively. 
Concentrations of alanine aminotransferase, 
aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, creatine 
kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, cardiac troponin I, 
N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and D-dimer 
were markedly higher in deceased patients than in 
recovered patients. Common complications observed 
more frequently in deceased patients included acute 
respiratory distress syndrome (113; 100%), type I 
respiratory failure (18/35; 51%), sepsis (113; 100%), 
acute cardiac injury (72/94; 77%), heart failure 
(41/83; 49%), alkalosis (14/35; 40%), hyperkalaemia 
(42; 37%), acute kidney injury (28; 25%), and 
hypoxic encephalopathy (23; 20%). Patients with 
cardiovascular comorbidity were more likely to 
develop cardiac complications. Regardless of history 
of cardiovascular disease, acute cardiac injury and 
heart failure were more common in deceased patients.
CONCLUSION
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
infection can cause both pulmonary and systemic 
inflammation, leading to multi-organ dysfunction 
in patients at high risk. Acute respiratory distress 
syndrome and respiratory failure, sepsis, acute 
cardiac injury, and heart failure were the most 
common critical complications during exacerbation of 
covid-19.
Introduction
Coronaviruses are important pathogens of humans 
and animals that can cause diseases ranging from the 
common cold to more severe and even fatal respiratory 
infections. In the past two decades two highly 
pathogenic human coronaviruses, the coronavirus 
responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome 
(SARS-Cov) and the coronavirus responsible for 
Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-Cov),1 2 have 
emerged in two separate events. They induced lower 
respiratory tract infection as well as extrapulmonary 
manifestations, leading to hundreds or thousands 
of cases with high mortality rates of up to 50% in 
certain populations. In December 2019 a new strain of 
coronavirus, officially named severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), was first 
isolated from three patients with coronavirus disease 
2019 (covid-19) by the Chinese Center for Disease 
Control and Prevention,3 4 connected to the cluster of 
acute respiratory illness cases from Wuhan, China.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC
As of 28 February 2020, more than 2858 people had died of coronavirus disease 
2019 (covid-19), with the highest mortality rate of 4.5% in Wuhan, China
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) infection causes 
clusters of severe and even fatal pneumonia
Clinical characteristics of patients with covid-19 who died have not been fully 
elucidated yet
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
Certain patients with covid-19, particularly those with advanced age and 
hypertension, were in a critical condition on admission and progressed rapidly to 
death within two to three weeks from disease onset
SARS-Cov-2 infection can cause both pulmonary and systemic inflammation, 
leading to multi-organ dysfunction in high risk populations
In addition to acute respiratory distress syndrome and type I respiratory failure, 
acute cardiac injury and heart failure may also contribute to the critical illness 
state associated with high mortality

Recent epidemiological reports have provided evidence 
for person to person transmission of the SARS-Cov-2 in 
family and hospital settings.5 6 As of 28 February 2020, 
the number of patients infected with SARS-Cov-2 has 
exceeded 83 652 globally, and more than 2858 have 
now died of covid-19, with the highest mortality rate 
of 4.47% in Wuhan. On 30 January 2020, the World 
Health Organization declared that the outbreak of 
SARS-Cov-2 constituted a public health emergency of 
international concern.
Evidence indicates that substantial similarities 
exist between severe acute respiratory syndrome and 
covid-19. A recent study reported a 79.5% genome 
sequence identity between SARS-Cov-2 and SARSCov, and SARS-Cov-2 was 96% identical in terms of 
whole genome sequence to a bat coronavirus.7
 Clinical 
and pathological features of patients with covid-19 
have recently been reported, showing that the SARSCov-2 infection causes clusters of severe and even 
fatal pneumonia with clinical presentation greatly 
resembling that of SARS-Cov infection, associated with 
admission to intensive care units and high mortality.8
The first study of the initial 41 laboratory confirmed 
cases with covid-19 showed that 28 (68%) of 41 
patients had been discharged and six (15%) had died.8
A larger case series involving 138 consecutive patients 
admitted to hospital with covid-19 showed that 47 
(34%) patients were discharged and six died (overall 
mortality 4.3%).9
 Demographic, clinical, laboratory, 
and radiological differences between patients who 
were and were not admitted to the intensive care unit 
have been fully evaluated. Given that the numbers of 
patients in these studies is relatively small, information 
about the clinical characteristics of patients who died 
is scarce. No vaccine or specific antiviral treatment 
for covid-19 has yet been shown to be effective, so 
supportive therapy that eases the symptoms and 
protects multi-organ function may be beneficial. 
Identifying or more promptly treating patients in high 
risk groups is crucial to decrease the mortality rate.
In this study, we did a comprehensive evaluation 
of deceased patients and patients recovered among 
those with confirmed covid-19 who were previously 
transferred or admitted to the isolation ward of 
Wuhan Tongji Hospital, which is one of the designated 
hospitals assigned by Chinese government for patients 
severely or critically ill with covid-19. We aimed to 
compare the demographic, clinical, laboratory, and 
radiological features of patients with different clinical 
outcomes.
Methods
Study participants and data collection
From 13 January to 12 February 2020, 799 moderately 
to severely ill or critically ill patients with confirmed 
covid-19 were transferred from other hospitals or 
isolation sites or admitted from fever clinics to Tongji 
Hospital. Tongji Hospital was urgently reconstructed 
and has been assigned by Chinese government as a 
designed hospital for severely or critically ill patients 
with covid-19. As of 28 February 2020, 113 of the 799 
patients had died, with a mortality rate of up to 14.1%, 
and 161 patients had recovered and been discharged. 
The remaining 525 patients were still in hospital and 
receiving medical care. All patients were diagnosed as 
having covid-19 and classified as being moderately, 
severely, or critically ill according to the Guidance 
for Corona Virus Disease 2019 (6th edition) released 
by the National Health Commission of China.10 All 
the recovered patients with covid-19 had completely 
resolved symptoms and signs, had significant 
improvement in pulmonary and extrapulmonary 
organ dysfunction, and no longer needed supportive 
care, with confirmed viral clearance by repeated tests 
for SARS-Cov-2 before hospital discharge. Written 
informed consent was waived owing to the rapid 
emergence of this infectious disease.
We obtained epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, 
and radiological characteristics, as well as treatment 
and outcome data, from electronic medical records 
for deceased patients and recovered patients by 
using data collection forms. We collected data on 
demographics, medical history, exposure history, 
underlying chronic diseases, symptoms and signs, 
laboratory findings, computed tomographic scans of 
the chest, and treatment (including antiviral therapy, 
antibiotics, corticosteroid therapy, and oxygen 
support) during the hospital admission. The clinical 
data were monitored up to 28 February 2020. The 
research team of experienced clinicians from Tongji 
Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University 
of Science and Technology analysed patients’ medical 
records. A trained team of physicians and researchers 
independently entered and cross checked data in a 
computerised database. If the core data were missing, 
we sent requests for clarification to the coordinators, 
who subsequently contacted the clinicians 
responsible for the treatment of the patients. As some 
patients presented with various forms of disorder of 
consciousness on admission, we obtained data on 
their medical histories and pre-admission information 
through contact with their close relatives and by 
accessing medical records from previous hospital 
visits.
The supplementary table shows the criteria and 
definitions for the diagnosis, clinical classification 
(mild, moderate, severe, and critically ill),10 and 
complications (acute respiratory distress syndrome, 
acute kidney injury, sepsis, shock, acute liver injury, 
acute heart failure, and cardiac injury)8 11-13 for 
covid-19.
Laboratory measurements
Real time reverse transcription polymerase chain 
reaction assay for SARS-Cov-2
Throat swab samples were collected for extracting 
SARS-Cov-2 RNA from patients. The respiratory sample 
RNA isolation kit (Biogerm, Shanghai, China) was used 
to extract total RNA within two hours. Briefly, 40 μL 
of cell lysates were transferred into a collection tube 
followed by vortex for 10 seconds. After standing at 
room temperature for 10 minutes, the collection tube

was centrifuged at 1000 revolutions per minute for five 
minutes. The suspension was used for real time reverse 
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay 
of SARS-Cov-2 RNA. Two target genes—open reading 
frame 1ab (ORF1ab) and nucleocapsid protein (N)—
were simultaneously amplified and tested during the 
real time RT-PCR assay. Target 1 (ORF1ab) comprised 
forward primer CCCTGTGGGTTTTACACTTAA, reverse 
primer ACGATTGTGCATCAGCTGA, and the probe 
5′-VIC-CCGTCTGCGGTATGTGGAAAGGTTATGGBHQ1-3′. Target 2 (N) comprised forward primer 
GGGGAACTTCTCCTGCTAGAAT, reverse primer 
CAGACATTTTGCTCTCAAGCTG, and the probe 5′-
FAM- TTGCTGCTGCTTGACAGATT-TAMRA-3′. The 
real time RT-PCR assay was conducted using a SARSCov-2 nucleic acid detection kit according to the 
manufacturer’s protocol (Shanghai Bio-germ Medical 
Technology company). The reaction mixture contains 
12 μL of reaction buffer, 4 μL of enzyme solution, 4 μL 
of Probe primers solution, 3 μL of diethyl pyrocarbonate 
treated water, and 2 μL of RNA template. The RT-PCR 
assay was conducted under the following conditions: 
incubation at 50°C for 15 minutes and 95°C for five 
minutes, 40 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 15 
seconds, and extending and collecting fluorescence 
signal at 55°C for 45 seconds. A cycle threshold value 
less than 37 was defined as a positive test result, and 
a cycle threshold value of 40 or more was defined as a 
negative test. These diagnostic criteria were based on 
the recommendation by the National Institute for Viral 
Disease Control and Prevention (China) (http://ivdc.
chinacdc.cn/kyjz/202001/t20200121_211337.html). 
A medium load, defined as a cycle threshold value of 
37 to less than 40, required confirmation by retesting.
Clinical laboratory measurements
Initial clinical laboratory investigation included 
a complete blood count, serum biochemical tests 
(including liver and kidney function, creatine kinase, 
lactate dehydrogenase, and electrolytes), a coagulation 
profile, and cytokine tests. Respiratory specimens, 
including nasal and pharyngeal swabs, or sputum were 
tested to exclude evidence of other viral infections, 
including influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, avian 
influenza, parainfluenza virus, and adenovirus.
Principles of management of patients
Supportive therapy
Vital signs and oxygen saturation should be monitored 
(every eight hours; patients with severe disease 
need continuous monitoring), supportive treatment 
strengthened, sufficient calories provided, and the 
stability of the internal environment, such as water, 
electrolyte, and acid-base balance, maintained. The 
intake and output volumes should be strictly balanced, 
especially in critical ill patients.
Oxygen therapy
Supplemental oxygen therapy should be given 
immediately to patients with hypoxaemia. Oxygen 
therapy can be started at a flow rate of 5 L/min, and 
the target oxygen saturation is pulse oxygen saturation 
≥90% in non-pregnant adult patients, ≥92-95% in 
pregnant patients, and ≥94% in patients who are 
critically ill with severe respiratory distress, shock, or 
coma.
If standard oxygen therapy fails, mechanical 
ventilation should be considered; high flow nasal 
catheter oxygen or non-invasive ventilation (for 
example, bilevel positive airway pressure mode) can 
be used. If no improvement is seen within one hour 
of non-invasive mechanical ventilation, invasive 
mechanical ventilation should be used. Experienced 
experts can recommend extracorporeal membrane 
pulmonary oxygenation according to their evaluation 
of the patient’s situation.
Empirical antimicrobial therapy
If a history of seasonal or local influenza epidemiology 
exists, empirical therapy may be considered.
Blood purification therapy
Continuous renal replacement therapy can be used in 
critically ill patients.
Statistical analysis
We present categorical variables as numbers and 
percentages and continuous variables as mean and 
standard deviation if they were normally distributed 
or median and interquartile range if they were not. 
We compared means for continuous variables by 
using independent group t tests when the data were 
normally distributed; otherwise, we used the MannWhitney test. We compared proportions for categorical 
variables by using the χ2
 test. We used Fisher’s exact 
test in the analysis of contingency tables when the 
sample sizes were small. For unadjusted comparisons, 
we considered a two sided P value below 0.05 to be 
statistically significant. We used SPSS (version 19.0) 
for all analyses.
Patient and public involvement
This was a retrospective case series study, and 
no patients were involved in the study design or 
in setting the research questions or the outcome 
measures directly. No patients were asked to advise on 
interpretation or writing up of results.
Results
Demographics and baseline characteristics of 
deceased patients and recovered patients
From 13 January to 12 February 2020, 799 moderately 
to severely ill or critically ill patients with confirmed 
covid-19 were transferred or admitted to Tongji 
Hospital. As of 28 February 2020, 113 of these 
patients had died of covid-19 and 161 patients had 
fully recovered and been discharged. As shown in 
table 1, the median age of deceased patients was 68 
(interquartile range 62.0-77.0) years, which was 
significantly older than recovered patients (51 (37.0-
66.0) years); 94 (83%) deceased patients and 59 
(37%) who recovered were aged 60 or older. Male

sex was more predominant in deceased patients 
(83; 73%) than in recovered patients (88; 55%). 
Overall, 71 (63%) patients who died and 62 (39%) 
who recovered had at least one chronic medical 
condition. Hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and 
cerebrovascular disease were much more frequent 
among deceased patients (54 (48%), 16 (14%), and 
4 (4%)) than among recovered patients (39 (24%), 
7 (4%), and 0 (0%)). Few patients had a current or 
former cigarette smoking history of at least 30 pack 
years. The proportion of healthcare workers among 
deceased patients (1; 1%) was significantly lower 
than among recovered patients (18; 11%). Likewise, 
the proportion of patients with a history of close 
contact with previously confirmed patients tended 
to be lower in deceased patients (44; 12%) than in 
recovered patients (33; 20%).
Fever and cough were the most prevalent symptoms 
at disease onset in both deceased patients (104 (92%) 
and 79 (70%)) and recovered patients (145 (90%) and 
106 (66%)), and the proportions of patients reporting 
these symptoms in the two groups were comparable. 
Other prevalent symptoms at onset of illness in 
deceased patients included fatigue, dyspnoea, chest 
tightness, and sputum production; less common 
symptoms included anorexia, diarrhoea, and 
myalgia. Dyspnoea and chest tightness were much 
more common in deceased patients (70 (62%) and 
55 (49%)) than in recovered patients (50 (31%) 
and 48 (30%)). Twenty five (22%) people who died 
and only one (1%) who recovered had disorders of 
consciousness on hospital admission. Nine deceased 
patients and 16 who recovered had no fever, with 
fatigue, cough, dyspnoea, myalgia, or diarrhoea as 
the initial symptoms. Among these, one patient with 
no symptoms who recovered was diagnosed as having 
covid-19 during routine physical examination, and 
another complained only of stinging eyes for two 
weeks before being admitted to hospital.
Among the deceased patients, the median time 
from onset of symptoms to hospital admission was 
10.0 (interquartile range 7.0-13.0) days, which 
tended to be longer than for recovered patients (9.0 
(6.0-12.0) days). The median time from onset of 
symptoms to death in deceased patients was 16 (12.0-
20.0) days, and the median time from first symptoms 
to discharge in recovered patients was 26 (21.8-29.0) 
days. The median time from admission to death was 5 
(3.0-9.3) days and the median time from admission to 
discharge was 16 (14.0-19.0) days.
Measures of vital signs were recorded on the day of 
hospital admission for all patients. Median systolic 
blood pressure was significantly higher in deceased 
patients (137.0 mm Hg) than recovered patients 
(125.0 mm Hg). More patients who died than who 
recovered had arterial pressure of 140 mm Hg or 
higher (50 (44%) v 33 (20%)). Heart rates were 
much higher in deceased patients (101.0 beats per 
minute) than in recovered patients (91.0 beats per 
minute). Respiratory rates were significantly higher 
in deceased patients (24.0 breaths per minute) than 
in recovered patients (20.0 breaths per minute). 
Deceased patients more often developed tachycardia 
and tachypnoea (respiratory rate ≥24 breaths per 
minute) (56 (50%) and 66 (58%)) than did recovered 
patients (48 (30%) and 22 (14%)). Seventy two (64%) 
deceased patients and only 19 (12%) who recovered 
had percutaneous oxygen saturation of 93% or below 
on admission.
Laboratory parameters of deceased pa
ients and recovered patients
We observed substantial differences in laboratory 
findings between patients who died of covid-19 and 
those who recovered from it (table 2). Fifty six (50%) 
deceased patients and only six (4%) who recovered 
developed leukocytosis (white blood cell count 
≥10×109
/L). Deceased patients had persistent and 
more severe lymphopenia than recovered patients; 
44 (39%) deceased patients and eight (5%) recovered 
patients had lymphocyte counts below 0.5×109
/L. 
Median platelet counts were significantly lower in 
deceased patients.
Concentrations of alanine aminotransferase, 
aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, alkaline 
phosphatase, and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase 
were markedly higher in deceased patients than 
in recovered patients. Fifty nine (52%) deceased 
patients and 25 (16%) who recovered had abnormal 
aspartate aminotransferase concentrations (>40 U/L). 
Albumin concentrations were significantly lower in 
deceased patients than in recovered patients. Seventy 
four (65%) deceased patients and 22 (14%) recovered 
patients developed hypoalbuminaemia (albumin 
<32 g/L). Concentrations of blood urea nitrogen, 
creatinine, potassium, triglycerides, creatine kinase, 
and lactate dehydrogenase were significantly higher 
in deceased patients than in recovered patients. 
Concentrations of hypersensitive cardiac troponin 
I and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide were 
markedly higher in deceased patients (40.8 pg/mL and 
800.0 pg/mL) than in recovered patients (3.3 pg/mL 
and 72.0 pg/mL), with eight deceased patients having 
cardiac troponin I above 1000 pg/mL and two above 
10 000 pg/mL. In addition, deceased patients more 
often had increased cardiac troponin I and N-terminal 
pro-brain natriuretic peptide concentrations (68/94 
(72%) and 68/80 (85%)) than did recovered patients 
(15/109 (14%) and 17/93 (18%)).
Median prothrombin time was significantly longer 
in deceased patients than in recovered patients, 
whereas activated partial thromboplastin time 
was comparable between the two groups. D-dimer 
concentrations were markedly greater in deceased 
patients (4.6 μg/mL) than in recovered patients 
(0.6 μg/mL). Thirty four (35%) of 97 deceased 
patients and only three (2%) of 150 recovered 
patients had D-dimer concentrations above 21μg/
mL. Concentrations of procalcitonin, high sensitivity 
C-reactive protein, and ferritin, as well as erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate, were significantly higher in 
deceased patients than in recovered patients. Thirty

five (36%) of 96 deceased patients and three (2%) of 
140 recovered patients had procalcitonin of 0.5 ng/
mL or higher. Thyroid stimulating hormone and free 
triiodothyronine concentrations were significantly 
lower in deceased patients (0.7 mIU/mL and 2.8 
pmol/L) than in recovered patients (1.4 mIU/mL and 
4.3 pmol/L). Serum circulating immunoglobulin A, 
immunoglobulin G, and immunoglobulin M did not 
differ significantly between the two groups, whereas 
complement 3 and complement 4 concentrations were 
markedly lower in deceased patients than in recovered 
patients.
Of patients with available data, concentrations 
of interleukin 2 receptor, interleukin 6, interleukin 
8, interleukin 10, and tumour necrosis factor α
were significantly higher in deceased patients than 
in recovered patients. Deceased patients more 
often had increased concentrations of interleukin 
2 receptor, interleukin 6, interleukin 8, interleukin 
10, and tumour necrosis factor α than did recovered 
patients. Most (48/53; 91%) deceased patients had 
undetectable concentrations of interleukin 1β. Forty 
two (86%) of 49 deceased patients and 58 (50%) of 
117 recovered patients had proteinuria, and 40 (82%) 
of 49 deceased patients and 44 (38%) of 117 recovered 
patients showed microscopic haematuria.
On admission, abnormalities on chest radiographs 
were seen in all patients (fig 1); 113 (100%) deceased 
patients and 152 (94%) recovered patients had bilateral 
involvement on chest radiographs. Typical findings 
on chest computed tomography images on admission 
of deceased patients showed bilateral ground glass 
opacity and subsegmental areas of consolidation (fig 
1, A and C), which then progressed rapidly with mass 
shadows of high density in both lungs (fig 1, B and D). 
Representative chest computed tomography images 
of recovered patients showed right middle lobe and 
lower lobe ground glass opacity and consolidation 
(fig 1, E and F); then bilateral ground glass opacity 
and bilateral consolidation of the lungs progressed 
but right middle lobe consolidation resolved (fig 1, G). 
Follow-up images showed obviously resolved bilateral 
ground glass opacity and consolidation (fig 1, H).
Arterial blood gases were measured in 35 deceased 
patients and 32 recovered patients (table 3). Five (14%) 
deceased patients and 3 (9%) recovered patients had 
pH below 7.35, whereas 14 (40%) deceased patients 
and five (16%) recovered patients had pH 7.45 or 
above. The median arterial partial pressure of oxygen 
in deceased patients was 59.2 mm Hg, which was 
significantly lower than that of recovered patients 
(121.0 mm Hg). Eighteen of 35 deceased patients and 
none who recovered had arterial partial pressure of 
oxygen below 60 mmHg, and all of these had partial 
pressure of carbon dioxide below 50 mmHg, indicating 
that they had type I respiratory failure. The median 
arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired 
oxygen ratio was significantly lower in deceased 
patients (105.1) than in recovered patients (350.0). 
Moreover, all the deceased patients and 14 (44%) 
recovered patients had an arterial partial pressure 
of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio of 300, 
indicating that these patients had developed acute 
respiratory distress syndrome, whereas severe acute 
respiratory distress syndrome (≤100) developed only 
in deceased patients (16; 46%). Actual bicarbonate 
and total carbon dioxide concentration were markedly 
lower in deceased patients than in recovered patients.
Complications and primary interventions of 
deceased patients and recovered patients
Among the deceased patients, respiratory and cardiac 
complications were numerous (table 4). Common 
complications observed in deceased patients included 
acute respiratory distress syndrome (113; 100%), 
type I respiratory failure (18/35; 51%), sepsis (113; 
100%), acute cardiac injury (72/94; 77%), heart 
failure (41/83; 49%), shock (46; 41%), alkalosis 
(14/35; 40%), hyperkalaemia (42; 37%), acute kidney 
injury (28; 25%), and hypoxic encephalopathy (23; 
20%). These were significantly more frequent than in 
recovered patients, showing their potential association 
with the clinical outcome. Less common complications 
in deceased patients included acidosis, disseminated 
intravascular coagulation, and acute liver injury. One 
patient who died developed gastrointestinal bleeding. 
Patients with cardiovascular comorbidities were more 
likely to develop acute cardiac injury and heart failure. 
In addition, although more deceased patients had 
chronic hypertension, among patients with available 
data regardless of history of coexisting cardiovascular 
disease, cardiac complications were more frequent in 
deceased patients than in recovered patients.
Fewer deceased patients (89; 79%) than recovered 
patients (147; 91%) received monotherapy 
or combination therapy with antiviral agents 
(oseltamivir, arbidol, or lopinavir/ritonavir), whereas 
more deceased patients (99; 88%) than recovered

patients (118; 73%) were given glucocorticoid therapy, 
considering the severe pneumonia and “cytokine 
storm” observed in patients who died. One hundred 
and five (93%) deceased patients and 144 (89%) who 
recovered received empirical antibacterial therapy 
(moxifloxacin, cefoperazone, or azithromycin). Forty 
four (39%) deceased patients and 59 (37%) who 
recovered received intravenous immunoglobulin 
therapy. Fewer deceased patients (25; 22%) than 
recovered patients (64; 40%) received interferon α
inhalation treatment. Significantly more deceased 
patients (93; 82%) than recovered patients (26; 16%) 
received mechanical ventilation. Invasive mechanical 
ventilation was needed in 17 (15%) deceased 
patients, one of whom received extracorporeal 
membrane pulmonary oxygenation as rescue therapy.

Three deceased patients received continuous renal 
replacement therapy.
Discussion
Our study comprehensively described the major 
differences in clinical features between the patients 
who died of covid-19 and those who recovered from it. 
The median age of deceased patients was significantly 
older than that of recovered patients. Male sex was 
more predominant in patients who died than in those 
who recovered. Chronic hypertension and other 
cardiovascular comorbidities were more frequent 
among deceased patients than recovered patients. 
Symptoms related to hypoxemia were more common 
in deceased patients than in recovered patients. 
Deceased patients more often developed systematic 
inflammation and multi-organ dysfunction than did 
recovered patients. The indicators of cardiac injury 
showed more frequent or prominent abnormalities 
in deceased patients than in recovered patients. The 
information provided will further enrich knowledge 
about this critical disease and may consequently help 
to improve patients’ outcomes and lower the fatality 
rate.
Comparison with other studies
The clinical spectrum of covid-19 varies widely, 
ranging from an asymptomatic infection to severe 
and critical pneumonia with high fatality rates. The 
Chinese Centers for Disease Control recently reported 
that most of the confirmed cases were classified as 
mild or moderate, 13.8% as severe, and only 4.7% as 
critically ill.14 The overall fatality rate for confirmed 
covid-19 cases was found to be higher in male than in 
female patients, with the risk of death rising with age 
for both sexes. The highest fatality rate was in people 
aged 80 and above.
The overall mortality rate of covid-19 is much lower 
than for severe acute respiratory syndrome (10%) and 
Middle East respiratory syndrome (30%).15 16 However, 
covid-19 has ultimately proven more deadly as it has 
spread to many more people globally than did the 
others, owing to rapid person to person transmission 
and atypical symptoms at an early stage in certain 
patients.5 9 Here, we report a relatively high mortality 
rate for covid-19 of up to 14.1%, which is higher 
than in recent reports.9
 This is partly due to a large 
proportion of severely or critically ill patients admitted 
to Tongji Hospital, one of the designated hospitals 
for severe covid-19, and to the medical resource 
limitations at the beginning of the covid-19 outbreak. 
These resources were improved by early February, with 
prompt supply of medics and medical necessities from 
across the nation to Wuhan. 
In accordance with the recent reports on 
characteristics of patients with covid-19 who needed

management in intensive care units,8 9 17 advanced 
age (>60), male sex, and comorbidities (particularly 
hypertension) are believed to be risk factors for severe 
disease and death from SARS-Cov-2 infection. Thus, 
early vigilant monitoring along with high quality 
supportive care are needed in patients at high risk. 
It is notable that healthcare workers as well as close 
contacts of previously confirmed patients were likely 
to have a good outcome, which is consistent with 
the relatively low fatality rate (0.3%) reported in 
healthcare workers.18 This could be explained by the 
fact that in our study the median age of the healthcare 
workers was much younger than that of the remaining 
patients (data not shown). It could also be partly 
due to the lower mortality observed in the second 
generation of SARS-Cov-2 infection,19 as well as to the 
early awareness of potential infection in that scenario 
meaning that people would seek medical care or 
start treatment promptly. Furthermore, the time from 
onset of symptoms to hospital admission was longer 
in deceased patients, as some of them had been in a 
critical condition before being transferred from other 
healthcare units to Tongji Hospital. This highlights the 
need to develop community awareness about prompt 
seeking of medical care and earlier referral to the 
intensive care unit for high risk populations.
The incidence of symptoms including fever, cough, 
fatigue, anorexia, myalgia, and diarrhoea did not differ 
significantly between deceased patients and recovered 
patients, whereas dyspnoea, chest tightness, and 
disorders of consciousness were more common in 
those who died. Moreover, the vital signs data showed 
that most deceased patients had tachycardia and/or 
tachypnoea as well as pulse oxygen saturation of 93% 
or lower. These signs and symptoms indicated that 
most deceased patients had been in a severe or critical 
condition on admission, and the onset of certain 
symptoms may help physicians to identify the patients 
at risk of a poor outcome.
The differences in abnormalities of laboratory 
findings between the deceased patients and the 
survivors were substantial. Most of the deceased 
patients and only a few recovered patients developed 
leukocytosis, and one third of deceased patients and 
only few who recovered had procalcitonin above 0.5 
ng/mL, indicating that a large proportion of deceased 
patients might have had secondary bacterial infection, 
which could be strongly associated with death. 
Deceased patients had persistent and more severe 
lymphopenia compared with recovered patients, 
suggesting that a cellular immune deficiency state 
was associated with poor prognosis. In addition, 
other common laboratory abnormalities in deceased 
patients included coagulation disorder (elevation of 
prothrombin time and D-dimer), impaired liver and 
kidney function (mild or moderate elevation of alanine 
aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, 
total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, γ-glutamyl 
transpeptidase, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine 
and frequent hypoalbuminaemia, haematuria, and 
albuminuria), electrolyte disturbance (hyperkalaemia 
and hypernatraemia), elevated inflammatory markers 
(high sensitivity C-reactive protein, ferritin, and 
erythrocyte sedimentation rate), and cytokine storm. 
Most notably, markedly higher concentrations of 
creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, cardiac 
troponin I, and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic 
peptide were seen in deceased patients than in 
recovered patients. Increase in cardiac troponin I and 
N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide was much 
more frequent and significant than that in the recent 
reports,8 9 likely owing to the relatively small number 
of deceased patients and more patients at earlier stages 
of the disease included in those studies.
In the later stages of the disease, patients who 
die may develop pulmonary and extrapulmonary 
organ damage, including acute respiratory distress 
syndrome, type I respiratory failure, sepsis, acute 
cardiac injury, heart failure, acute kidney injury, 
hypoxic encephalopathy, shock, acidosis or alkalosis, 
disseminated intravascular coagulation, and acute 
liver injury, although the last two complications were 
less frequent. Development of respiratory, cardiac, 
and neurological complications is strongly associated 
with poor outcome in patients with covid-19. Patients 
with cardiovascular comorbidities were more likely to 
develop cardiac complications. Cardiac complications 
were frequent not only in deceased patients with 
cardiovascular comorbidities but also in those without 
cardiovascular comorbidities, suggesting that the high 
risk of cardiac complications in deceased patients could 
not be entirely ascribed to coexisting cardiovascular 
disease. Furthermore, in addition to acute respiratory 
distress syndrome and respiratory failure, acute 
cardiac injury and heart failure could be major factors 
contributing to the fatality risk of covid-19 regardless 
of history of previous cardiovascular disease. However, 
the pathological report of covid-19 associated with 
acute respiratory distress syndrome at present shows 
that pulmonary oedema with hyaline membrane 
formation in the lungs, but no obvious histological 
changes in heart tissue, was identified from one 
single case report.20 This suggests that the underlying 
mechanism of cardiac injury needs further exploration. 
The median time from onset of symptoms to death in 
deceased patients was 16 days, and the median time 
from first symptoms to discharge in recovered patients 
was 26 days. In covid-19, the evolution of pulmonary 
and systemic inflammation in the first two weeks may 
determine the physiological progression (resolving 
or progressing) and outcome of disease (death or 
survival).
To date, no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment 
for covid-19 has proven to be effective, so supportive 
therapy that eases the symptoms and protects important 
organs may be most beneficial. In this study, for 
patients without second bacterial infection, empirical 
antimicrobial treatment seemed to be ineffective. Fewer 
deceased patients than recovered received antiviral 
monotherapy or combination antiviral therapy, as 
well as interferon α inhalation treatment. Considering 
the severe pneumonia and “cytokine storm” observed

in deceased patients, more of these patients were 
given glucocorticoid therapy than recovered patients. 
Because of hypoxaemia, significantly more deceased 
patients than recovered received ventilation. We cannot 
conclude from this study which antivirals given at the 
right time would be beneficial, or whether steroid use 
would be beneficial, for patients with covid-19; further 
investigation is needed.
Substantial similarities exist between covid-19 
and severe acute respiratory syndrome, from 
the virus homology to the potential origin, main 
transmission route (respiratory droplets), identified 
receptor (angiotensin converting enzyme 2), clinical 
manifestation, and disease dynamics.21 Risk factors for 
severe covid-19 or severe acute respiratory syndrome 
outcomes are old age and comorbidities. Progression 
for patients with severe disease follows a similar 
pattern for both viruses.21 Although both viruses 
can cause severe and even lethal lower respiratory 
tract infection and extrapulmonary manifestations, 
myocardial injury and heart failure are more frequently 
reported in patients with covid-19, indicating a unique 
pathophysiology.22 These findings will alert clinicians 
to pay special attention not only to the development of 
respiratory dysfunction but also to the signs of cardiac 
complications.
Limitations of study
Our study has several limitations. Firstly, almost 
all the deceased patients were classified as being 
severely or critically ill, whereas a large proportion 
of recovered patients might be classified as having 
moderate disease. This patient setting reflects the 
real world situation where most confirmed cases are 
mild or moderate. Nevertheless, the high incidence of 
cardiac complications in deceased patients is of great 
importance, raising awareness of the need for earlier 
monitoring and cardiac supportive care. Secondly, 
nearly a third of deceased patients developed 
disorders of consciousness on admission, ranging 
from somnolence to deep coma, which may result in 
a loss of some information (particularly a detailed 
history and subjective symptoms). Additionally, some 
laboratory tests (for example, cardiac troponin I, 
N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and arterial 
blood gas tests) were not done in all the patients, and 
missing data or important tests might lead to bias of 
clinical characteristics. Thirdly, the median length of 
hospital admission before death was about five days, 
information on the dynamic changes in laboratory 
variables in deceased patients was lacking, and the 
data collected for each patient on admission may have 
been from different disease stages. Therefore, further 
study is warranted to gain a better understanding 
of risk factors for and outcome of covid-19, which 
ultimately may help to guide efforts aimed at reducing 
the fatality rate.
Conclusions and policy implications
Certain patients with covid-19, particularly those with 
advanced age and hypertension, were in a critical 
condition on admission and progressed rapidly to 
death within two to three weeks from disease onset. 
SARS-Cov-2 infection can cause both pulmonary 
and systemic inflammation, leading to multi-organ 
dysfunction in high risk populations. In addition 
to acute respiratory distress syndrome and type I 
respiratory failure, acute cardiac injury and heart 
failure may also contribute to the critical illness state 
associated with high mortality, which highlights 
the importance of earlier cardiac monitoring and 
supportive care in such patients.
