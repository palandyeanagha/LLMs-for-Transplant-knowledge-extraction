During 2001–2011, hepatitis E virus (HEV) was found in 
the blood of patients in Nanjing, China. All HEV-positive patients had virus genotype 4; subgenotype 4a was predominant. The effective population of HEV in Nanjing increased 
in ≈1980 and continued until ≈2003 when it plateaued.
Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a positive-sense, singlestranded RNA virus of the family Hepeviridae. Strains 
of HEV infecting swine, boars, deer, mongooses, rabbits, 
and humans belong to the genus Hepevirus (1). Hepeviruses are divided into 4 genotypes that cause sporadic and 
epidemic outbreaks of hepatitis E in humans. Epidemic 
outbreaks occur primarily in developing countries in Asia 
and Africa, and sporadic outbreaks occur worldwide (2,3). 
A study showed that HEV causes autochthonous hepatitis 
E in industrialized countries (4).
Genotypes 1 and 2 are transmitted from human to human and cause epidemic and sporadic outbreaks (3,5). Genotypes 3 and 4 are transmitted to humans zoonotically (6) and 
cause primarily sporadic cases of hepatitis E. The dominant 
genotype of HEV in China is genotype 4 (5,7,8). The purpose of this study was to analyze the prevalence and genotypes of HEV among infected patients in Nanjing, China.
The Study
A total of 15,910 patients admitted to the Second 
Hospital in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China, because of 
suspected acute viral hepatitis during January 1, 2001–
April 30, 2011, were evaluated by physicians to determine whether they were infected with HEV. Informed 
consent was obtained from all patients participating in this 
study. This study was conducted in accordance with national ethics regulation and was approved by the research 
ethics committee of Southeast University in Nanjing. Because several physicians evaluated the patients, a variety 
of clinical symptoms were used to diagnose viral hepatitis. 
Patients were tested for HEV by using serologic analysis. 
A total of 813 patients who were positive for IgM against 
HEV were tested for HEV RNA.
ELISAs for antibodies against HEV (Wan Tai Biologic Pharmacy Enterprise Co. Ltd, Beijing, China) were 
performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Inhouse sandwich enzyme immunoassays were used according to Dong et al. (9).
HEV primers were designed to amplify a 691-
bp segment from open reading frame 2 genotypes 1–4 
(Table 1). RNA extraction and cDNA sequencing were 
performed as described (10). Sequences identified 
have been deposited in GenBank under accession nos. 
JX997438–JX997647).
A total of 210 sequences were aligned by using 
ClustalX (11) and trimmed at their termini to remove 
gaps by using BioEdit version 7.0.5.3 (12). All sequences (n = 178) without a collection date were removed 
from the dataset. This sequence set was analyzed to estimate the time to the most recent common ancestor and to 
generate a skyline plot. These sequences align with open 
reading frame 2 sequence at nt 6454–6966 (GenBank accession no. AJ272108).
Sequencing confirmed that all 210 HEV RNA–positive 
patients were infected with HEV genotype 4. This exclusivity probably reflects the recent trend from infection by 
genotype 1 toward infection by genotype 4, and the dominance of genotype 4 in Nanjing is similar to that in other regions of China (7–9,13). Although the year of collection for 
serum specimens was recorded during 2006–2011, before 
2006, specific years of collection were not recorded. Records show there were 11 HEV RNA–positive patients at 
the hospital during 2001–2003 and 16 HEV RNA–patients 
during 2004–2005. During 2006–2010, the increase in the 
number of HEV RNA–positive patients was nearly linear. 
The total number of acute hepatitis E cases during 2011 
could not be determined because patients were examined 
only through the end of April 2011 (Figure 1).
Subgenotypes were determined by creating a neighborjoining phylogenetic tree from all patient sequences and 
reference sequences obtained from GenBank: EF077630 
for subgenotype 4a, EU676172 for 4b, AB193177 for 4c, 
GU361892 for 4d, AY723745 for 4e, AB220974 for 4f, and 
AB108537 for 4g by using ClustalX (11). Subgenotypes 
detected were 4a, 4b, 4c, 4d, 4g, and 3 sequences that appear to belong to an undescribed subgenotype and are most 
similar to GenBank sequences AB369690, AB521805, 
AB521806, DQ450072, and EF570133. The predominant

HEV Genotype 4, Nanjing China, 2001–2011
subgenotype was 4a (50.2%) (Table 2). Subgenotypes 4b, 
4c, 4d, and 4g had prevalences of 5.4%, 9.3%, 32.7% and 
1.0%, respectively. The unknown subgenotype had a prevalence of 1.5%.
To examine whether there was a change in the prevalence in any of the 3 most abundant subgenotypes (4a, 4c, 
and 4d) detected, we conducted χ2 analyses. Numbers of 
subgenotype sequences found for each subgenotype were 
compared with every other subgenotype in adjacent time 
intervals. In addition, numbers of subgenotypes were compared between the first time period (2001–2003) and 2010 
and 2011. The p values for all comparisons were >0.11 except for comparison between subgenotypes 4a and 4c from 
2008 with those from 2009 (p = 0.04). Values for subgenotypes 4b, 4g, and the unknown subgenotype were all within 
2 SD of their respective means (Table 2). This finding indicates that there were no major differences in subgenotype 
prevalence over time.
BEAST version 1.71 (14) was used to estimate the 
time to the most recent common ancestor and to create a 
skyline plot as described (13) but with use of the Kimura 
3-parameter substitution model. Calculation of the time to 
the most recent common ancestor for sequences with confirmed dates of collection estimated that the most recent 
common ancestor for these sequences existed 102.5 years 
ago (range 69.1–141.4 years ago). A skyline plot created 
from the dated sequences suggests that the effective population of HEV in Nanjing increased slightly more than 1 
log. This increase started in ≈1980 and continued until 
≈2003, when the effective population of HEV genotype 4 
in Nanjing reached a plateau (Figure 2).
Conclusions
The current findings are different from those reported 
by Purdy and Khudyakov (13), which showed an increase 
in the effective population of HEV genotype 4 in China 
from ≈1900 through ≈1940 when the effective population plateaued. Although both plots show an increase in 
the effective population that plateaus, the periods for these 
changes differed.
There are 3 potential causes for these differences. First, 
because the earlier plot (13) was constructed with fewer sequences, sampling error may be a factor. Second, the earlier plot nonetheless used longer sequences with many more 
segregating sites. Third, the earlier plot included sequences 
originating from a larger geographic area. The second and 
third reasons could potentially result in more sites with substitutions, resulting in higher sequence diversity, which could 
extend time estimates further into the past. Because of these 
3 disparate factors, we cannot ascertain which plot would be 
more accurate or whether both plots are correct within their 
specific contexts. Nevertheless, the common feature of both 
plots is that the effective population of HEV genotype 4 has 
increased and subsequently reached a plateau.
These data suggest that HEV genotype 4 has undergone 
a relatively recent expansion in the late twentieth century in 
Nanjing. The most dominant subgenotype is 4a, and subgenotype distribution has not changed over the past decade. 
Therefore, a stable population of genotype 4 HEV has been 
established in the Nanjing region of China. This finding is 
consistent with the trend observed in other areas within China in which decreases in the prevalence of HEV genotype

1 have been accompanied by increases in the prevalence of 
genotype 4 (5,7,8). Whether this replacement of genotype 1 
by genotype 4 reflects changes in the environment, changes 
in mode of transmission, or introduction of HEV genotype 4 
to animal reservoirs to which humans have been exposed requires further studies. Such investigations are particularly urgent given the continuing increase in China of the prevalence 
of acute hepatitis E associated with HEV genotype 4 (15).
