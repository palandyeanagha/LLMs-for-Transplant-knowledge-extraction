Objective: To assess the technical feasibility and local efficacy of percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) combined 
with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) for an intermediate-sized (3-5 cm in diameter) hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC) under the dual guidance of biplane fluoroscopy and ultrasonography (US).
Materials and Methods: Patients with intermediate-sized HCCs were treated with percutaneous RFA combined with TACE. 
RFA was performed under the dual guidance of biplane fluoroscopy and US within 14 days after TACE. We evaluated the rate 
of major complications on immediate post-RFA CT images. Primary technique effectiveness rate was determined on one 
month follow-up CT images. The cumulative rate of local tumor progression was estimated with the use of Kaplan-Meier 
method.
Results: Twenty-one consecutive patients with 21 HCCs (mean size: 3.6 cm; range: 3-4.5 cm) were included. After TACE 
(mean: 6.7 d; range: 1-14 d), 20 (95.2%) of 21 HCCs were visible on fluoroscopy and were ablated under dual guidance of 
biplane fluoroscopy and US. The other HCC that was poorly visible by fluoroscopy was ablated under US guidance alone. 
Major complications were observed in only one patient (pneumothorax). Primary technique effectiveness was achieved for 
all 21 HCCs in a single RFA session. Cumulative rates of local tumor progression were estimated as 9.5% and 19.0% at one 
and three years, respectively.
Conclusion: RFA combined with TACE under dual guidance of biplane fluoroscopy and US is technically feasible and 
effective for intermediate-sized HCC treatment.

INTRODUCTION
Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is used widely for the local 
treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (1). Although 
the therapeutic efficacy of RFA of small HCC (i.e., < 2 cm) 
is comparable to surgical outcome (2), RFA has shown poor 
local tumor control when the tumor size exceeds 3 cm (3). 
This is because in these cases, an ablation zone created 
by RFA is not adequate enough to cover the large primary 
tumor and any microscopic satellite nodules that may be 
present at approximately the primary tumor (4). Therefore, 
it is generally agreed that patients with HCCs < 3 cm in the 
greatest diameter are the best candidates for RFA according 
to the guidelines for the management of HCC (5, 6). 
Recently, combined transcatheter arterial 
chemoembolization (TACE) and RFA has attracted attention

RFA and Chemoembolization for Hepatomas Under Dual Guidance of Fluoroscopy and US
as a more promising technique for improving the local tumor 
control of HCCs, even lesions with a maximum diameter > 3 
cm (7-10). Combined TACE and RFA have several advantages 
over RFA treatment alone. Theoretically, hypoxic injury by 
embolization along with the chemotherapeutic effect is 
synergic to thermal ablation by lowering the convection 
by blood flow and decreasing the impedance in the tumor 
(11, 12). In addition, a disruption of the intratumoral septa 
after chemoembolization may facilitate heat distribution 
within the tumor and decreased perfusion-mediated tissue 
cooling by embolization results in a larger ablation zone 
during the RFA procedure (13). Moreover, satellite nodules, 
which are found more commonly around large HCCs can be 
controlled by TACE (14).
In terms of the guidance for electrode placement during 
the RFA procedure, the retained iodized oil by prior TACE 
is a good landmark for accurate targeting and overlapping. 
This merit is magnified when the size of the tumor is 
large, thereby requiring multiple overlapping treatments. 
Therefore, biplane fluoroscopy (both anteroposterior and 
lateral projections), which can facilitate easier targeting 
and overlapping ablations using accumulated iodized oil by 
prior TACE as a landmark, can be considered an alternative 
guiding modality in this setting (15). On the other hand, 
ultrasonography (US) or CT/CT fluoroscopy have been used 
exclusively for the guidance of RFA in combined TACE and 
RFA (7, 8, 10, 16, 17), but few have described the dual 
guidance of biplane fluoroscopy and US for intermediatesized (3-5 cm) HCC (15). Therefore, the purpose of this 
study was to evaluate the technical feasibility and local 
efficacy of RFA combined with TACE for intermediate-sized 
HCCs under the dual guidance of biplane fluoroscopy and 
US.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
This retrospective study was approved by the institutional 
review board and the need for informed consent was waved. 
From February 2009 to September 2010, patients who met 
the following inclusion criteria were assessed and treated 
with combination of TACE and RFA: 1) 3 or less HCCs, 2) 
the size of the largest tumor ranging in size from 3 cm 
to 5 cm; 3) Child-Pugh class A or B; 4) no evidence of 
vascular invasion or extrahepatic metastases on the CT 
or MR images; 5) absence of severe coagulopathy (i.e., 
prothrombin activity < 40% or platelet count < 40000/
mL); and 6) tumor located at least 1 cm away from the 
hilar bile duct. All patients suspected of having HCC 
underwent a routine physical examination, blood laboratory 
tests, and dynamic CT and/or MRI. The diagnosis of HCC 
was based on the American Association for the Study of 
Liver Diseases guidelines (18) as follows: typical vascular 
pattern (hypervascular in the arterial phase, and washout in the portal/delayed phase) of the liver nodule in at 
least one of the dynamic CT or MRI. No patient underwent a 
percutaneous biopsy. The location and size of each patient’s 
HCC was evaluated using the CT or MR images. Tumor size 
was defined as the maximum diameter measured on the 
CT or MR images, and the segmental location of the tumor 
was recorded in the data sheet according to the Couinaud 
nomenclature.
During the study period, 21 consecutive patients with 
HCCs were included (Tables 1, 2). Among them, 2 patients 
had 2 HCC nodules each. Both patients had one tumor larger 
than 3 cm at the longest diameter and the other smaller 
than 3 cm, making a total of 23 HCCs. Percutaneous RFA was 
also performed for these 2 HCCs < 3 cm, but these 2 lesions 
were not of our interest in this study, and thus excluded 
from the analysis. Of the 21 patients, 16 patients had no 
treatment history of HCC, whereas the other 5 patients had 
a previous treatment history using the following methods: 
hepatic resection (n = 3) or percutaneous RFA (n = 2). The 
size of 21 HCCs was 3.6 ± 0.4 cm in the longest diameter

RFA and Chemoembolization for Hepatomas Under Dual Guidance of Fluoroscopy and US
with a range of 3-4.5 cm (median: 3.5 cm). Seventeen 
(81.0%) HCCs were located in the subphrenic region, either 
directly contacting the diaphragm or within 1 cm from the 
diaphragm.
Planning US for RFA
For the patients who met the inclusion criteria, planning 
US was performed by one certificated abdominal radiologist 
with at least 8 years’ experience in liver US (more than 
15000 cases) and US-guided interventional procedures (more 
than 2000 cases) including biopsy, drainage and RFA, at 
the beginning of this study. Through the planning US, the 
radiologist searched for the HCC thoroughly and evaluated 
the expected electrode path, adjacent organ vulnerable to 
thermal injury, tumor size, lesion conspicuity, and heatsink effect to determine if percutaneous RFA was feasible. 
All planning US were performed with a multi-frequency 4C1 
convex array probe (Acuson Sequoia 512, Siemens Medical 
Solutions, Mountain View, CA, USA). At the time of planning 
US, the radiologist was aware of the patients’ clinical 
information and liver CT and/or MR images. After a careful 
evaluation of the prior liver CT and/or MR images, the 
radiologist searched for the HCC thoroughly and evaluated 
the expected electrode path, adjacent organ vulnerable to 
thermal injury, tumor size, lesion conspicuity, and heat-sink 
effect to determine if percutaneous RFA was feasible (19).
Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization
All TACE procedures were performed on an inpatient basis 
by one of 2 interventional radiologists with at least 9 years 
of experience in interventional radiology at the starting 
point of this study. The hepatic artery was catheterized 
after celiac and superior mesenteric arteriography using 
a 5 Fr catheter (Cook, Bloomington, IN, USA). Depending 
on the size, location and arterial supply of the tumor, the 
3 Fr microcatheter (Microferret; Cook, Bloomington, IN, 
USA) was advanced toward the tumor-feeding arteries for 
selective embolization. Therefore, segmental embolization 
of the tumor supplying artery was performed, sparing 
the majority of hepatic parenchymal arterial supply, 
using an emulsion of iodized oil (Lipiodol; Andre Gurbet, 
Aulnay-sous-Bois, France) and doxorubicin hydrochloride 
(Adriamycin RDF; Ildong Pharmaceutical, Seoul, Korea). An 
infusion of this emulsion was performed until arterial flow 
stasis had been achieved and/or iodized oil was visualized 
in the portal branches. The dose of embolization agent was 
determined according to the tumor size, tumor number, 
feeding vessels and liver function status. This procedure 
was followed by the embolization of gelatin sponges (1-
mm in diameter; Gelfoam; Upjohn, Kalamazoo, MI, USA). 
After embolization, angiography was performed again to 
determine the extent of the vascular occlusion and the 
presence of any residual tumor staining.
Radiofrequency Ablation
Within 14 days after TACE, percutaneous RFA was 
performed by a radiologist with more than 4 years’ 
experience (> 200 cases) in RFA of HCC at the starting 
point of this study. The patients were placed in the supine 
position and treated under local anesthesia or general 
anesthesia depending on the tumor size and location. When 
the index tumor was abutting the portal vein, we preferred 
general anesthesia rather than local anesthesia. RFA was 
performed in an interventional suite equipped with a flatpanel biplane fluoroscopy/angiography instrument (Allura 
Xper FD 20/10, Philips Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands). 
US guidance was used concurrently to determine the safe 
skin entry site and to enable accurate targeting of the 
index tumor, as well as monitoring of the ablation process. 
Seventeen-gauge, internally cooled electrodes with a 3 
cm-long exposed tip (Cool-tip; Valleylab, Boulder, CO, 
USA or Well-point RF Electrode; STARmed, Goyang, Korea) 
were used. RF energy was delivered using an impedancebased control algorithm of the generator according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions for each device. Artificial ascites 
was infused, whenever it was required, to improve the 
sonic window and decrease the degree of collateral thermal 
injury to the adjacent diaphragm or colon (20, 21). The 
site of skin puncture was determined based on the findings 
of both biplane fluoroscopy and US. Therefore, traversal of 
the critical structures, such as colon, gallbladder, and large 
vessels, was avoided in all cases. Although the tumor was 
located in the subphrenic region, a transhepatic approach 
not traversing the thoracic cavity was possible in almost all 
cases using the oblique approach. 
Real-time biplane fluoroscopy was used to place the 
radiofrequency electrode through the tumors, if the index 
tumor was visible on both anteroposterior and lateral 
projections due to iodized oil retained from prior TACE. 
The targeting time, which is the time measured from the 
skin puncture of the electrode to the placement of the 
electrode through the index tumor, was typically within 
one minute. To achieve adequate ablative margin (at least 
0.5 cm), multiple overlapping ablations were applied as 

252 Korean J Radiol 14(2), Mar/Apr 2013 kjronline.org
Min et al.
needed, depending on the tumor size, shape, and location. 
The number of radiofrequency electrodes was dependent 
on the visibility of the target tumor on fluoroscopy and 
the location of the tumor. Generally, multiple electrodes 
(up to 3 electrodes) were used if the lesion conspicuity 
on fluoroscopy was not radiopaque enough for multiple 
overlapping treatments. In addition, if the tumor was 
located close to any critical structures vulnerable to thermal 
injury, multiple electrodes were used for precise placement 
of the electrode. When multiple electrodes were used, 
sequential ablation of each electrode was performed since 
generator capable of delivering RF energy with switching 
mode was not available at the time of the study period. 
Multiple overlapping treatments were possible in most 
tumors under the real-time guidance of biplane fluoroscopy, 
because the visibility of iodized oil retained remained 
almost unchanged after ablation cycles. The ablation time 
was variable and dependent on the US findings. If a large 
echogenic zone was obtained in 3-6 min, the tip of the 
electrode was repositioned under real-time guidance of 
biplane fluoroscopy. In other words, a short ablation time 
with a multiple overlapping strategy rather than a standard 
12 min single ablation (i.e., 6 min x 2 overlapping ablations 
rather than 12 minutes x 1 ablation) was adopted because 
we believe that the former could create a larger ablation 
zone than the latter. If the index tumor was not clearly 
demonstrated on the fluoroscopic imaging, US guidance 
alone was used for the RFA procedure. At the end of the 
procedure, tract ablation was performed to prevent bleeding 
or tumor seeding. 
Follow-Up after RFA
Computed tomography was performed immediately after 
RFA to evaluate the technical success and procedure-related 
complications. When the CT images depicted the presence 
of a nonenhancing area surrounding the entire tumor, it 
was defined as a technical success (10, 22). A second RFA 
session was undertaken only when nodular enhancement 
was observed near the accumulated iodized oil at the CT 
images (10, 22). The patients were then followed up with 
contrast-enhanced CT, one month later, and then every 
three months after treatment. The overall follow-up time 
was defined as the interval between the first RFA and either 
local tumor progression or the last follow-up visit by May 
23, 2012. 
Analysis on Therapeutic Efficacy
The presence of major complications was evaluated based 
on the previous guideline of standardized terminology 
(23), which is defined as any event leading to substantial 
morbidity and disability, increased level of care, 
lengthened hospital stay, or a required blood transfusion or 
interventional drainage procedure. All other complications 
were deemed to be minor. 
In addition, therapeutic efficacy of RFA was assessed 
based on standardization paper of image-guided tumor 
ablation (23). Technical success was assessed based 
on immediate post-RFA CT images. Primary technique 
effectiveness was evaluated by dynamic CT performed one 
month after the combined TACE and RFA. At dynamic liver 
CT, local tumor progression was defined as a new enhancing 
lesion within or adjacent to the ablation site (23). The 
cumulative rate of local tumor progression was estimated 
with the use of Kaplan-Meier method. A distant metastasis 
was defined as a new HCC in the liver distant from the 
treated nodule or in extrahepatic regions.
RESULTS
Treatment Process
Radiofrequency ablation was performed with a 2-week 
interval after initial TACE. At the starting point of this 
study, a sufficient time interval between the 2 procedures 
was preferred due to the safety concerns of the patients. On 
the other hand, the time interval between the 2 procedures 
was subsequently reduced to less than a week. The mean 
time interval between the 2 procedures was 6.7 d, ranging 
from 1 to 14 d. Artificial ascites was introduced in 17 
(81.0%) patients immediately before placing the electrodes 
to minimize collateral thermal injury and enhance the 
sonic window. A single electrode was used in 16 (76.2%) 
patients and 3 electrodes were used in the other 5 (23.8%) 
patients. After segmental TACE, 20 (95.2%) out of 21 
HCCs were visible on fluoroscopy, and were ablated under 
biplane fluoroscopy guidance assisted by US. The remaining 
HCC nodule, which was poorly visible on fluoroscopy, was 
ablated under US guidance alone. Multiple overlapping 
ablations under US guidance alone were technically difficult 
due to the echogenic zone induced by prior ablation cycles. 
A long RFA procedure time (total ablation time: 31.1 ± 
9.0 min; range, 17.5-47 min) was required to achieve 
a sufficient ablative margin using multiple overlapping 
ablations (the number of overlapping ablations: 5.9 ± 2.0; 

kjronline.org Korean J Radiol 14(2), Mar/Apr 2013 253
RFA and Chemoembolization for Hepatomas Under Dual Guidance of Fluoroscopy and US
range: 3-12). 
Therapeutic Efficacy and Complication
On the CT images, the mean diameters of the ablation 
zone for the long and short axes induced by RFA were 5.2 
± 0.4 cm and 3.8 ± 0.2 cm, respectively. Technical success 
was achieved in all 21 HCCs after a single RFA session (Fig. 
1). Primary technique effectiveness based on the onemonth follow-up CT was also achieved in all 21 HCCs. 
There were no treatment-related deaths. There was 
only one major complication, which was a pneumothorax 
necessitating chest tube placement for 4 days. This 
was an unexpected complication due to an unplanned 
transpulmonary approach. It may have been caused by 
a transgression of the lower margin of the basal lung 
by the lesser caudal angled approach, which could have 
been avoided easily if a steeper approach to transgress 
the liver, not the lung, had been performed. There were 8 
minor complications: post-ablation syndromes (n = 5) and 
diaphragmatic thermal injury (n = 3).
Local tumor progression was found in 4 (19.0%) of 21 
HCCs during the follow-up period (mean follow up: 24.8 ± 
9.9 months; range: 6.5-37.3 months). Cumulative rates of 
local tumor progression were estimated as 9.5% and 19.0% 
at 1 and 3 years, respectively (Fig. 2). Four HCCs, which 
were found to have local tumor progression 7, 11, 15, and

RFA and Chemoembolization for Hepatomas Under Dual Guidance of Fluoroscopy and US
16 months after the combined treatment, had an adequate 
ablative margin after the initial combined treatment. The 4 
HCCs with local tumor progression were treated with RFA (n 
= 3) and TACE (n = 1), respectively. A distant intrahepatic 
metastasis was found in 11 (52.4%) of 21 patients, which 
were managed with repeated RFA (n = 2), TACE (n = 3), 
combined TACE and RFA (n = 5) or radiation therapy (n = 1). 
None of the patients died during the follow-up period.
DISCUSSION
This study demonstrates that RFA combined with 
TACE under dual guidance of biplane fluoroscopy and 
US is technically feasible and effective in controlling 
intermediate-sized HCCs. Technical success was achieved 
after single RFA session in all 21 HCC nodules through 
multiple overlapping treatments (mean: 5.9 times). This 
treatment method seems to have an acceptable rate of 
local tumor progression of 19.0% (4/21) at the end of the 
third year. Pneumothorax was a major complication in only 
one patient and was resolved after chest tube insertion. 
Therefore, this dual guiding method can be considered a 
viable option for RFA combined with TACE.
In terms of combined TACE and RFA for intermediate-sized 
HCCs, several studies have employed US alone as a guiding 
modality for RFA (9, 10). In a study by Kim et al. (9), RFA 
was performed 3 days to 2 weeks after TACE, which was 
similar to our study (1 to 14 days after TACE). Although the 
mean size of the tumors between the 2 studies is similar (our 
study: 3.6 ± 0.4 cm versus the study by Kim et al. (9): 3.8 
± 0.5 cm), the number of overlapping ablations was larger 
in this study than in that study (5.9 ± 2.0 vs. 3.1 ± 1.7). 
Consequently, second RFA session was not required in our 
study, whereas it was 5.3% (3/57) for patients in Kim et 
al. (9) Moreover, although statistical significance was not 
reached (p = 0.1088, Fisher’s exact test), the local tumor 
progression rate at the end of the third year was lower 
in our study (19.0%, 4/21) than Kim et al. (9) (40.4%, 
23/57). This suggests that the dual guidance of biplane 
fluoroscopy and US has an advantage over US guidance 
alone. In general, large HCCs are often difficult to ablate 
under US alone guidance because multiple overlapping 
ablations are technically difficult due to echogenic zone 
generated by previous ablation cycles obscuring the target 
tumor and electrode. Furthermore, the US visibility of the 
tumor is sometimes poor when the index tumor is located 
in the subphrenic region (24, 25). In addition, in cases of 
combined treatment, prior chemoembolization can alter the 
sonographic conspicuity of the index tumor owing to the 
variable uptake of iodized oil and chemotherapeutic agent 
in the tumor and adjacent hepatic parenchyma (26).
Recently, Morimoto et al. (10) reported combined TACE 
and RFA of intermediate-sized HCC performed on the 
same day. The mean size (3.6 ± 0.7 cm) of the tumors in 
Morimoto et al. (10) was similar to that (3.6 ± 0.4 cm) 
of our study. Although statistical significance was not 
reached (p = 0.3451, Fisher’s exact test), the local tumor 
progression rate at the end of the 3rd year was lower in 
Morimoto et al. (10) (5.3%, 1/19) than in our study (19.0%, 
4/21). On the other hand, the number of overlapping 
ablations (1.6 ± 0.6) was significantly smaller in Morimoto 
et al. than in our study (5.9 ± 2.0). Nevertheless, the size 
of the ablation zone (long axis: 5.8 ± 1.3 cm and short 
axis: 5.0 ± 1.1 cm) in Morimoto et al. (10) was slightly 
larger than that in our study (long axis: 5.2 ± 0.4 cm and 
short axis: 3.8 ± 0.2 cm). This can be explained by the fact 
that the time interval between TACE and RFA was different 
(the study by Morimoto et al: same day versus this study: 
mean 6.7 d, range: 1-14 d). Although there is no consensus 
regarding the ideal time interval between TACE and RFA, 
it is believed that the shorter time interval between the 2 
procedures provides better therapeutic efficacy with a larger

ablation zone by the reduction of perfusion-mediated tissue 
cooling using embolization, which is supported by Morimoto 
et al. (10). In our study, the retained iodized oil was not 
radiopaque enough to place the electrode under biplane 
fluoroscopy guidance due to the washout of iodized oil from 
the target tumor when RFA was performed 2 weeks after 
TACE. In addition, the size of the ablation zone by RFA after 
TACE was smaller than expected with a 2-week interval after 
TACE. The size of the ablation zone would decrease with 
time after TACE. Therefore, the time interval between the 
2 procedures was reduced to less than a week during the 
study period. Technical success was achieved after 1.1 ± 0.2 
RFA sessions by Morimoto et al. (10) and after a single RFA 
session in our study, which suggests that US alone guidance 
for RFA is technically difficult for intermediate-sized HCCs 
compared to dual guidance of biplane fluoroscopy and US 
(Fig. 1).
The merit of biplane fluoroscopy-guided RFA for HCC 
after TACE is well documented in a recent study (15). The 
point that deserves emphasis is that targeting and multiple 
overlapping ablations during RFA procedure for HCC with 
retained iodized oil can be performed easily under realtime guidance of biplane fluoroscopy. This is because 
simultaneous visualization of the anteroposterior and lateral 
projection images improves the spatial relationship of the 
tumor with the retained iodized oil, which contributes to a 
faster and more efficacious procedure. Unlike US, the lesion 
conspicuity was not hindered by microbubbles generated 
by previous ablation cycles on fluoroscopy; thereby 
multiple overlapping ablations can be performed with high 
confidence. In this study, multiple overlapping ablations 
were performed up to 12 times. Although US was also used 
as an adjuvant guiding modality, US was used to avoid 
traversing the critical intrahepatic or extrahepatic structures 
during targeting the tumor and monitoring the ablation 
procedure.
Computed tomography fluoroscopy has also been used as 
a guiding modality for RFA combined with TACE (7, 8, 16). 
Similar to guidance under biplane fluoroscopy, microbubbles 
within and around the tumor does not prevent repositioning 
of the electrode in the tumor with CT fluoroscopy, and 
the accumulation of iodized oil in a tumor is helpful for 
inserting the electrode precisely in the tumor. On the other 
hand, the major drawback of this method is the substantial 
radiation exposure to both the patients and physicians 
(16). In addition, targeting a hepatic dome HCC would be 
technically cumbersome because transhepatic approach 
(oblique approach) is sometimes difficult due to the limited 
range of CT gantry tilting. Although the transthoracic 
approach for a dome lesion is generally considered safe, 
a pneumothorax can occur in 38-70% of cases, requiring 
frequent chest tube placement (27-29). Compared to CT 
fluoroscopy, the major strength of biplane fluoroscopy is 
the relatively low radiation exposure to the patients and 
physicians. Furthermore, the easier targeting of subphrenic 
HCCs, which is often difficult to visualize on US, through 
an oblique approach without thoracic transgression is a 
potential advantage of biplane fluoroscopy guidance. One 
drawback of biplane fluoroscopy guidance compared to CT 
guidance is that not all HCCs with retained iodized oil are 
clearly visible on fluoroscopy. In the present study, 4.8% 
(1/21) of HCCs treated previously with TACE was poorly 
visible on fluoroscopy; hence US alone-guided RFA was 
performed. 
Recently, Lee et al. (30) reported promising results of 
switching monopolar RFA with multiple electrodes for 3.1-
5.0 cm sized HCC without combining chemoembolization. 
In that study, technique effectiveness was achieved in 
29 (96.7%) of 30 patients and local tumor progression 
occurred in 3 (10.3%) of 29 patients with technique 
effectiveness during the follow-up period (mean, 12.5 
months). Although long-term results are not available, this 
switching monopolar RFA with multiple electrodes may have 
a potential to obviate the need for combining TACE and RFA 
for intermediate-sized HCC. Further study with long-term 
results is warranted to verify the therapeutic efficacy of 
switching monopolar RFA with multiple electrodes.
There were several limitations in this study. First, all 
RFA procedures were performed by a single radiologist in 
a single institution. Therefore, the results of this study 
might have been influenced by the experience of the 
radiologist and patient population. In addition, unlike US, 
the accessibility of biplane fluoroscopy is not high in most 
institutions because it is more expensive than monoplane 
fluoroscopy. On the other hand, if biplane fluoroscopy is 
available, using both biplane fluoroscopy and US would 
be helpful for the guidance of RFA for HCCs with retained 
iodized oil. Second, the number of patients included was 
relatively small. Therefore, a large cohort of patients and 
prolonged follow-up period will be needed to assess its 
long-term therapeutic efficacy.
In conclusion, percutaneous RFA combined with TACE 
under dual guidance of biplane fluoroscopy and US is 
technically feasible and effective for the treatment of

RFA and Chemoembolization for Hepatomas Under Dual Guidance of Fluoroscopy and US
intermediate-sized HCCs. This dual guiding technique 
facilitates accurate targeting and overlapping ablations 
using the iodized oil retained in the tumor as a landmark. 
Although the HCC lesions are located in the subphrenic 
region, the transthoracic approach can be avoided using 
this technique.
