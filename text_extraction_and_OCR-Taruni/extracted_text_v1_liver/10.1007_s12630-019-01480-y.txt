Abstract
Purpose Restrictive fluid management strategies have
been proposed to reduce complications in liver transplant
recipients. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate
the effects of restrictive perioperative fluid management
strategies, compared with liberal ones, on postoperative
outcomes in adult liver transplant recipients. Our primary
outcome was acute kidney injury (AKI). Our secondary
outcomes were bleeding, mortality, and other postoperative
complications.
Source We searched major databases (CINAHL, EMB
Reviews, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and the grey literature)
from their inception to 10 July 2018 for randomizedcontrolled trials (RCTs) and observational studies
comparing two fluid management strategies (or
observational studies reporting two outcomes with
available data on fluid volume received) in adult liver
transplant recipients. Study selection, data abstraction,
and risk of bias assessment were performed by at least two
investigators. Data from RCTs were pooled using risk
ratios (RR) and mean differences (MD) with random-effect
models.
Principal findings We found seven RCTs and 29
observational studies. Based on RCTs, fluid management

strategies did not have any effect on AKI, mortality, or any
other postoperative complications. Intraoperative RCTs
suggested that a restrictive fluid management strategy
reduced pulmonary complications (RR, 0.69; 95%
confidence interval [CI], 0.47 to 0.99; n = 283; I2 =
27%), duration of mechanical ventilation (MD, -13.04 hr;
95% CI, -22.2 to -3.88; n = 130; I2 = 0%) and blood loss
(MD, -1.14 L; 95% CI, -1.72 to -0.57; n = 151; I2 = 0%).
Conclusion Based on low or very low levels of evidence,
we did not find any association between restrictive fluid
management strategies and AKI, but we observed possible
protective effects of intraoperative restrictive fluid
management strategies on other outcomes.

syste´matique visant a` e´valuer les effets des strate´gies de
prise en charge liquidienne pe´riope´ratoire restrictives, par
rapport a` des strate´gies libe´rales, sur les pronostics
postope´ratoires des re´cipiendaires adultes de
transplantation he´patique. Notre crite`re d’e´valuation
principal e´tait l’insuffisance re´nale aigue¨ (IRA). Nos
crite`res secondaires e´taient les saignements, la mortalite´
et les autres complications postope´ratoires.
Source Nous avons effectue´ des recherches dans les
principales bases de donne´es (CINAHL, revues EMB,

randomise´es controˆle´es (ERC) et les e´tudes
observationnelles comparant deux strate´gies de prise en
charge liquidienne (ou les e´tudes observationnelles
rapportant deux crite`res d’e´valuation et comportant des
donne´es disponibles sur les volumes liquidiens rec¸us) chez
les re´cipiendaires adultes de transplantation he´patique. La
se´lection des e´tudes, l’extraction des donne´es et
l’e´valuation du risque de biais ont e´te´ re´alise´es par au

Constatations principales Nous avons retenu sept ERC
et 29 e´tudes observationnelles. Selon les ERC, les
strate´gies de prise en charge liquidienne n’ont eu aucun
effet sur l’IRA, la mortalite´, ou toute autre complication
postope´ratoire. Selon les ERC intraope´ratoires, les
strate´gies de prise en charge liquidienne
restrictives re´duisaient les complications pulmonaires
(RR, 0.69; intervalle de confiance [IC] 95 %, 0,47 a`
0,99; n = 283; I2 = 27 %), la dure´e de la ventilation

Conclusion En se fondant sur des niveaux de donne´es
probantes faibles ou tre`s faibles, nous n’avons trouve´
aucune association entre des strate´gies de prise en charge

Liver transplantation is the only effective therapy for
severe end-stage liver disease and is increasingly
performed throughout the world.1,2 On average, liver
transplant recipients suffer from more than three early
postoperative complications (renal, pulmonary, and
infectious being the most common), with over half of
them being severe.3,4 Perioperative variables, including
hemodynamic variations and transfusion volume, have
been associated with these complications.5-11 Nevertheless,
very few interventions are known to decrease their
incidence.12,13
A recent clinical trial conducted in adult patients
undergoing major abdominal surgery showed that a fixed
restrictive fluid management strategy was associated with
an increased risk of acute kidney injury (AKI).14 On the
other hand, evidence from systematic reviews of a wide
range of surgical procedures (including abdominal surgery)
suggest that the use of restrictive or cardiac output-guided
perioperative fluid management strategies improve
postoperative outcomes.15-18 None of the latter studies or
systematic reviews included liver transplant recipients and
no such high-quality data are available in this population.19
Despite the uncertain level of evidence, restrictive fluid
management strategies including phlebotomies,
normovolemic hemodilution, and conservative volume of
fluid administration have been recommended to improve
the outcome in this population.20-22
Considering the growing use of restrictive fluid
management strategy in liver transplant recipients, it
behooves us to understand its impact on the risk of
postoperative complications.20,21 As such, we conducted a
systematic review on the effects of restrictive fluid
management strategies compared with liberal ones on
clinically important outcomes in adult liver transplant
recipients.

Methods
We designed this systematic review according to the
standard methodology developed by the Cochrane
Collaboration23 and reported the results according to the
PRISMA statement.24 We previously published its
protocol.25
Search strategy and information sources
We developed a search strategy that incorporated key words
liver transplantation and fluid therapy. We used key words
from controlled vocabulary (MESH, EMTREE, and others)
and free text searching (see Electronic Supplementary Material
[ESM]). We searched the following databases: CINAHL
Complete, EMB Reviews, EMBASE, MEDLINE from
inception up to 10 July 2018, as well as the grey literature
(CADTH, Clinical Trials, National Guideline Clearing House,
NICE, MedNar, Google Scholar, and Open Grey). We
searched for other studies within the references of selected
studies. We searched for relevant abstracts published in the
annual meeting supplements of the following organizations for
the years available on their website: American Association for
the Study of Liver Diseases, European Association for the
Study of Liver, International Liver Transplantation Society,
American Society of Transplantation, and European Society of
Organ Transplantation.
Study eligibility
Participants
We included studies conducted in adults (defined as more
than 80% of participants of C 18 yr old or as defined in
individual studies) undergoing liver transplantation. We
excluded studies with more than 20% of the patients
receiving another concurrent solid organ
transplantation (kidney, lung, or heart).
Intervention
We considered any restrictive fluid management strategy,
defined as any fluid management strategy or protocol that
limited the amount of administered fluid, instituted in the
intraoperative and/or postoperative period (e.g., restrictive
early-goal directed protocols, restrictive weight-based
protocols, low-central venous pressure [CVP] protocols,
phlebotomies, restrictive fixed volume management
protocols, retrospectively restrictive classified groups, etc.).
Comparator
We considered any fluid management strategy that was
more liberal than the intervention.
Outcomes
Our primary efficacy outcome was the incidence of acute
kidney injury (AKI), as defined by authors (any definition)
up to 30 postoperative days. Our secondary outcomes were
mortality (hospital and latest in time reported), pulmonary
complications (pneumonia, pulmonary edema, acute
respiratory distress syndrome), duration of mechanical
ventilation (MV) (or ventilation-free days at latest in time
reported), graft complications (graft failure, biliary leak,
strictures and/or post-transplant cholangiopathy),
cardiovascular complications (myocardial infarction,
arrhythmias, shock, thromboembolic events), nonpulmonary infections, intraoperative bleeding, intensive
care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS), ICU readmission, and
hospital LOS (any definition). We selected AKI as a
primary patient-centred outcome because of its high
incidence (between 13% and 71 %) and its association
with both intraoperative and postoperative outcomes such
as mortality and burden of care.3,4,8,9,26,27
Types of studies
We included randomized-controlled trials (RCTs), quasi
randomized trials, and comparative non-randomized
studies (prospective or retrospective). Studies were
considered if at least two different fluid management
strategies were compared, one being more restrictive than
the other, or if at least two different volumes of fluid were
administered. Observational studies were also included if
the volume of fluid received could be extracted from at
least two different outcome-based groups categorized on
one of our outcomes of interest
Study selection and data extraction
We used Endnote X8.2 software to merge retrieved titles,
remove duplicates, and screen titles and abstracts. Four
investigators independently selected potentially eligible
studies (F.M.C. and a second reviewer (P.A., M.C., or S.I.).
Two investigators (F.M.C., M.C.) did a full-text review of
selected citations to confirm their eligibility. Studies in a
language other than French or English were translated before
data extraction. We contacted authors for additional
information when deemed necessary for inclusion (missing
data on outcome or exposure); no author answered our queries.
Two investigators (F.M.C. and H.T.W.) independently
extracted data from included studies using a standardized
123
Restrictive fluid and liver transplantation 111

electronic data extraction form that included study and
population characteristics, intraoperative and postoperative
type and volume of fluid received, bleeding, the amount of
blood products transfused, major co-interventions and every
reported outcome relevant to this review (see ESM).
Disagreements were resolved by consensus.
Risk of bias assessment
For RCTs, we assessed the risk of bias (RoB) using the
Cochrane RoB 2.0 assessment tool for our primary
outcome (AKI), or the primary outcome of the study
itself if AKI was not reported.28 For cohort studies, we
used the same approach for both exposure-based
(intervention vs control) and outcome-based studies
(patients with the outcome vs patients without the
outcome) and assessed RoB for the primary outcome of
the study (or AKI if no primary outcome was mentioned)
with the ROBINS-I tool.29 We classified any reported
association without adjustment for confounders as
‘‘critical’’ in the ‘‘confounding’’ domain and all outcomebased cohort studies as ‘‘critical’’ for the ‘‘classification of
intervention’’ domain. Two investigators (F.M.C. and
H.T.W.) independently assessed the RoB for all studies.
Disagreements were resolved by consensus. Risk of bias
was used for some subgroup analyses and for the GRADE
summary of findings table. We planned to assess
publication bias by funnel plots if more than ten
manuscripts were included per outcome.23
Data synthesis
We quantitatively pooled data from RCTs. We calculated
risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using
the Mantel-Haenszel method for dichotomous outcomes
and mean differences (MD) with 95% CI using the inverse
variance method for continuous outcomes. We used
reported medians in pooled analyses and calculated
standard deviations (SD) by dividing the interquartile
range [IQR] by 1.35. Means were reported with SD and
medians with IQR. We used random-effect models to
consider the underlying variation across studies. We
reported the I2 measure of consistency to evaluate
statistical heterogeneity. We performed three subgroup
analyses: period of interventions (intraoperative vs
postoperative), subtypes of interventions (studies using
low CVP as the restrictive fluid management strategy vs
others) and studies’ RoB (high vs low or some concerns of
RoB). We also performed sensitivity analyses by removing
studies reporting a median and by using a Bonferonni
correction to adjust for the multiple statistical tests we
performed through secondary outcome analyses (eight
statistical tests using 99.4% CI). For observational studies,
we calculated individual odds ratios (OR) with 95% CI and
MD with 95% CI for continuous outcomes. We performed
statistical analyses in Review Manager 5.3 (The Cochrane
Collaboration, 2014) and R (version 3.5.2). We generated a
summary of findings table with the quality of cumulative
evidence according to GRADE criteria with the
GRADEpro web-based tool (gradepro.org).30
Results
A flowchart of the study selection is presented in Fig. 1.
The studies and population characteristics are summarized
in Table 1 and eTable 1 (available as ESM), and the RoB
assessment is summarized in Fig. 2. We could not assess
publication bias because the number of included studies
was too low.
We found seven RCTs meeting our eligibility
criteria.31-37 We considered five of them at high
RoB.32,34-37 Five RCTs31-35 were conducted in the
intraoperative period: four of them used a low-CVP goal
as the restrictive fluid management strategy31,32,34,35 and one
used a strategy based on vasopressor use (norepinephrine vs
placebo) to restrict fluid intake.33 Two RCTs were
conducted in the postoperative period36: one compared
CVP with stroke volume or right ventricular end diastolic
volume as variables to guide fluid administration36; the other
study compared the administration of albumin with usual
care.37 Populations were comparable among RCTs, except
one study34 that included patients with more severe liver
failure than other studies (eTable 1 as ESM).
We found 29 observational cohort studies,38–66 with all
except two studies40,43 being considered at high or critical
RoB. Among the 14 exposure-based cohort studies,38-51
nine collected data from the intraoperative period: three
compared low CVP with another strategy (one compared
two centres using different protocols38; one compared two
groups retrospectively classified as to CVP values after
reperfusion39; and one compared low CVP with goaldirected therapy in a before-after study)40; one compared
stroke volume variation (SVV) goal-directed therapy with
high-CVP management41; two from the same centre
compared the use of phlebotomies with either unmatched
historical controls (before-after study)42 or contemporary
controls43; two compared two retrospectively classified
groups (one based on SVV44 and one based on the volume
of fluid received)45; and one compared two groups in a
before-after study (practice changed over time toward a
more restrictive approach).46 Three studies collected data
for the complete perioperative period (intraoperative and
postoperative periods): two before-after studies compared
patients receiving a restrictive fluid management (either
restrictive goal-directed therapy47 or a fast-track bundle
123
112 F. M. Carrier et al.

that included restricting fluid)48 with unmatched historical
controls and one compared two retrospectively classified
albumin-treated groups.49 Two before-after studies
collected data during the postoperative period: one
compared albumin administration to no administration50
and one compared patients receiving a goal-directed
therapy to unmatched historical controls.51 For the 15
outcome-based cohort studies,52-66 we compared volumes
of fluid received between reported groups in each outcome
section. The volume of fluid received, the amount of blood
products transfused, and other co-interventions are
presented in eTable 2a–c (available as ESM).
We summarized results by outcomes. Individual study
results and RCTs’ pooled results are reported in eTable 2
and eTable 3a–j (ESM) and Fig. 3 and eFig. 1 (ESM).
Subgroup and sensitivity analyses are reported in eFig. 2
and eFig. 3 (ESM).
Acute kidney injury (AKI)
Four out of seven RCTs reported data on AKI.31,35-37 Data
pooling was not possible because of outcome
heterogeneity. One study did not show any difference in
the risk of developing postoperative AKI without providing
any definition (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.35 to 2.20; n = 86)31
and one study reported no need for postoperative renal
replacement therapy (RRT) in either group.35 One
intraoperative RCT35 and two postoperative RCTs36,37
reported creatinine levels and did not show any difference
between groups (Table 2).

Seven exposure-based (restrictive vs liberal fluid
management) observational cohort studies reported data on
AKI (Table 2).38,40-42,44,49,67 Three intraoperative studies
and one perioperative study did not show any effect.41,44,49,67
One study reported that a restrictive strategy significantly
increased the need for RRT (not supported by our calculated
OR; see Table 2).38 One before-after intraoperative study
showed a higher incidence of AKI in the restrictive group

(the ‘‘before’’ group), without increased need for RRT.40 One
before-after study reported similar creatinine levels at
postoperative day 1, but lower levels in the restrictive
group (the ‘‘after’’ group) on postoperative day 3.42
Six studies used AKI as an outcome to categorize their
cohort.52-57 One intraoperative study did not show any
difference on the volume received between groups56 and
two intraoperative studies reported similar intraoperative
mean crystalloid volumes but different intraoperative mean
(SD) colloid volumes between groups [307 (438) mL AKI
vs 102 (202) mL no AKI, P = 0.005; 2259 (1382) mL AKI
vs 1453 (1618) mL, no AKI P = 0.06].55,57 One
perioperative study also showed higher median [IQR]
colloid volumes in the AKI group (2100 [0–4600] mL
(AKI) vs 1500 [500–2500] mL (no AKI) of intraoperative
colloid (P = 0.01), and 3850 vs 2000 mL of postoperative
colloid, respectively, no P value).54 Finally, one study
reported a higher mean (SD) fluid balance at postoperative
day 4 in patients with AKI [11841 (5395) mL (AKI) vs
8690 (3463) mL no (AKI), P = 0.05]52 and one study
reported a higher mean (SD) postoperative water balance at
day 1 in patients with AKI requiring RRT [2735 (2139) mL
(AKI) vs 1711 (1763) mL (no AKI), P = 0.01]53
(eTable 2c).
Mortality
Two RCTs reported mortality (eTable 3a).34,36 Pooled data
from reported mortality, the latest available in each study,
did not suggest any effect (RR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.54 to 2.15,
n = 118, I2 = 0%) (Fig. 3a). Of these two RCTS, the one
performed in an intraoperative setting reported no deaths at
1 month and a comparable one-year mortality between
groups (RR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.48 to 2.47; one study, n =
65).34 The second RCT performed during the postoperative
period reported a comparable three-month mortality
between three different groups.36 Among the twelve
cohort studies reporting data on mortality, eleven studies
did not show any effect38–42,44,47-50,67 and one study
reported a lower one-year mortality with the use of
intraoperative phlebotomy as part of a restrictive strategy
(OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.92)43 (eTable 3a).
Pulmonary complications
Four intraoperative RCTs reported pulmonary complications
either as a category or separately (pulmonary edema,
pneumonia or pleural effusion)31,33-35 and one
postoperative RCT reported incidence of pleural
effusions.36 Pooled data did not suggest any effect of fluid
management on pulmonary complications (RR, 0.78; 95%
CI, 0.51 to 1.17; five studies; n = 336; I2 = 69%)31,33–36
(Fig. 3b). In our first subgroup analysis, intraoperative
restrictive fluid management strategies decreased the risk
of pulmonary complications (RR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.47 to
0.99; four studies; n = 283; I2 = 27%)31,33-35 (Fig. 3b). No
effect in either RoB group (high, some concerns) was
observed (eFig. 2a). Nevertheless, we observed an effect
of intraoperative low-CVP management (RR, 0.61; 95% CI,
0.44 to 0.85; three studies; n = 218; I2 = 3%)31,34,35
(eFig. S2b). These subgroup analyses also identified
variables, such the period of intervention, that accounted
for the statistical heterogeneity (see Fig. 3a and eFig. 1a–b).

Duration of MV
We retrieved four RCTs reporting data on the duration of MV
(eTable 3c).33,34,36,37 Pooled results did not show any effect
of fluid management on duration of MV (MD, -0.62 days;
95% CI, -3.38 to 2.14; four studies; n = 223; I2 =
68%)33,34,36,37 (Fig. 3c). In our first subgroup analysis,
intraoperative restrictive fluid management strategies were
associated with a shorter duration of MV (MD, -13.04 hr;
95% CI, -22.20 to -3.88; two studies; n = 130; I2 = 0%)33,34
(Fig. 3c); this analysis also completely accounted for
statistical heterogeneity. In our second subgroup analysis,
no effect in either RoB group (high, some concerns) was
observed (eFig. 2c). One study used a low-CVP management
as their restrictive strategy and suggested an effect (MD,
-20.0 hr; 95% CI, -36.8 to -3.2; one study; n = 55).34
Four exposure-based (restrictive vs liberal fluid
management) observational studies reported duration of
MV.40,47,51,67 Two studies did not show any effect of fluid
management strategies.51,67 One study reported a
significantly longer duration of MV with a restrictive
strategy, not supported by our calculated MD (MD, 1.26;
95% CI, -0.19 to 2.71),40 and one study reported a shorter
median [IQR] duration of MV with a restrictive strategy
(20 [16–28] vs 94 [49–189] hr; P \ 0.01)47 (eTable 3c).
Two other studies used MV to categorize their cohort. One
study reported that patients with postoperative MV longer
than 48 hr did not receive more intraoperative fluid64 and
another study reported that ICU-extubated patients
received a lower mean (SD) intraoperative crystalloid
volume compared with patients extubated in the operating
room [3771 (454) vs 5306 (561) mL; P \ 0.05]65
(eTable 2c).
Other postoperative complications
In the four RCTs31,34,36,37 and five observational
studies38,39,41,49,67 reporting graft complications (graft
failure and acute rejection), fluid management strategy
was not associated with these outcomes (eFig. 1a and
eTable 3d). Only one perioperative cohort study reported
cardiovascular complications (hypotension requiring
vasopressors, myocardial infarction, pulmonary
embolism, deep vein thrombosis, and postoperative
hypertension requiring intravenous antihypertensive
agents) but did not show any effect (eTable 3e).49 Three
RCTs31,36,37 and six observational studies39,41,46,47,49,67
reported non-pulmonary infection-related complications
(reported as either sepsis,31,41,46,47 infections as a
category,36,37,39,67 or specific site infections)49; RCTs did
not suggest any effect (eFig. 1b). Only one before-after
study suggested a reduced incidence of infection-related
complications with restrictive fluid management strategy
(16% vs 48%) (eTable 3f).46
Intraoperative bleeding
Three intraoperative RCTs using a low-CVP target as their
restrictive fluid management strategy reported
intraoperative bleeding (eTable 3g); pooled data
suggested that an intraoperative restrictive fluid
management strategy reduced intraoperative bleeding
(MD, -1.14 L; 95% CI, -1.72 to -0.57; three studies; n =
226; I2 = 0%)31,32,34 (Fig. 3d). When the two studies at
high RoB were removed32,34 the effect was still significant
in the study with low RoB (MD, -1.19 L; 95% CI, -1.88 to
-0.49; one study; n = 86)31 (eFig. 2d). Removing the study
in which we used median values gave the same results
(eFig. 2e).32
Five observational studies reported intraoperative
bleeding; three of them did not show any effect39–41 and
two studies from the same centre (that included duplicated
patients) showed a reduced blood loss with intraoperative
phlebotomy42,43 (eTable 3g). A third study, also originating
from the same centre, reported data dichotomized as to
bleeding under or over the median from a larger cohort;
patients who bled less received less mean (SD)
intraoperative crystalloid [3637 (1153) vs 4491 (1839)
mL; P \ 0.00001] and were more likely to have had a
phlebotomy (65% vs 49%; P \ 0.0001).66 Part of this
cohort was included in previous publications from these
authors.42,43
Length of stay
Five RCTs reported ICU LOS (eTable 3h); pooled data did
not show any association between fluid management and
ICU LOS (MD, -0.26 days; 95% CI, -0.92 to 0.41; five
studies; n = 311; I2 = 71%)31,33,35–37 (Fig. 3e). In our
subgroup analyses, we observed a shorter ICU LOS
associated with intraoperative restrictive fluid
management strategies (MD, -0.79 days; 95% CI, -1.00 to
-0.58; three studies; n = 218; I2 = 0%)31,33,35 (Fig. 3e) as
well as with an intraoperative low-CVP management (MD,
-0.8 days; 95% CI, -1.02 to -0.59; two studies; n = 153; I2 =
0%)31,35 (eFig. 2h); these subgroup analyses explained the
observed statistical heterogeneity. We did not observe a
differential effect based on the RoB of the included studies.
We also observed no difference in effect when the study
reporting medians was removed (eFig. 2f and eFig. 2g).31
Three RCTs considered hospital LOS; none of them
suggested any effect (eFig.1c and eTable 3i).
Nine observational studies reported ICU
LOS38–40,44,47-50,67 and six of them showed no
effect.39,40,44,47,50,67 One intraoperative study suggested
122 F. M. Carrier et al.
123

an increased LOS with the use of a restrictive fluid
management strategy even though they reported it as nonsignificant38 and two intraoperative and postoperative
studies suggested a decreased LOS48,49 with the use of a
restrictive fluid management strategy (eTable 3h). Eight
studies reported hospital LOS38,39,42,44,47,67,68; four did not
show any effect,42,44,47,67 two reported an increased LOS
with the use of a restrictive fluid management strategy38,39
(one of them reported it as non-significant38 and two
suggested a decreased LOS48,49 with the use of a restrictive
fluid management strategy (eTable 3i). Two observational
studies reported ICU readmissions and did not show any
effect of the fluid management strategy48,67 (eTable 3j).
Sensitivity analyses for multiple statistical testing
We performed our meta-analyses using larger CIs to adjust
for multiple statistical testing (99.4%). The potential
protective effects of intraoperative restrictive fluid
management strategies on pulmonary complications were
no more statistically significant, but significant effects of
intraoperative restrictive fluid management strategies were
still observed for the duration of MV, intraoperative
bleeding, and ICU LOS (eFig. 3).

across studies, imprecision, and indirectness (as defined in
the GRADE methodology) the overall quality of evidence
was either low or very low.30
Discussion
Our work summarized evidence on perioperative fluid
management strategies in adult liver transplant recipients.
Based on a low or very low quality of evidence from RCTs,
fluid management strategies did not seem to have any
effect on the risk of AKI or mortality. Intraoperative
restrictive fluid management strategies might be associated
with fewer pulmonary complications, reduced duration of
MV, lower intraoperative blood loss and a reduced ICU
LOS. Limited data on other important outcomes, such as
graft, cardiovascular, and infection-related complications,
were reported. Even though the subgroup analyses of this
review suggest that an intraoperative restrictive fluid
management strategy might have a protective effect on
some of these complications, the level of certainty is
insufficient to support any recommendation.21,22,69
The majority of RCTs’ restrictive protocols were
intraoperative low-CVP management protocols based on
restricted fluid administration and were associated with
most of the observed effects. Further insight into different
types of fluid management protocols was provided by data
gathered from observational studies. Most of these studies
compared either CVP-oriented management with usual care
or retrospectively classified groups, and suggested that
pulmonary complications and bleeding might be reduced by
a restrictive fluid management strategy. Although the two
RCTs that reported no effect on AKI used an intraoperative
low-CVP management,31,35 one of the two observational
studies at moderate RoB compared low-CVP management
with goal-directed therapy and suggested an increased risk
of AKI with low-CVP management.40 This effect might be
explained by a temporal improvement effect, but a real
harmful effect of low-CVP management or a real protective
effect of goal-directed therapy might also be possible.
Central venous pressure is a poor predictor of fluid
responsiveness70 and low CVP-based fluid management
protocols probably do not achieve the same benefits as other
goal-directed strategies, such as stroke volume
optimization.17 We found one small (n = 53) postoperative
RCT at high RoB36 and five observational studies that used a
stroke volume based goal-directed therapy in at least one
group,40,41,44,47,51 which provided insufficient evidence to
draw firm conclusion on these strategies.
In many other surgical populations, there is good
evidence to support a protective effect of goal-directed
fluid management strategies that limit and tailor volume
administration to physiological parameters, such as stroke
volume, while fixed restrictive fluid management protocols
might increase AKI.14,17,18,71 Liver transplant recipients
may have concomitant cardiorespiratory comorbidities,
which may require specific fluid management strategies.
Goal-directed fluid strategies tailored to the various
surgical phases might be more effective than a fixed fluid
management strategy. The effects of such goal-directed
protocols in this population should be further explored.
Levels of CVP have been directly correlated with portal
hypertension and bleeding in liver transplant
recipients,66,72,73 which concurs with the association of
reduced blood loss with intraoperative low-CVP
management protocols that we observed.31,32,34 This
benefit was particularly robust in the subgroup and
sensitivity analyses. The addition of a phlebotomy to an
overall low-CVP strategy was described in one
centre.42,43,66 Phlebotomy was consistently associated
with lower blood loss and, even though this study had
residual and uncontrolled confounding, was the only
intervention associated with a lower mortality in the two
studies with moderate RoB.43
Many cohort studies conducted in this population
suggested an association between perioperative variables,
such as hypotension, vasopressor dose, or number of
transfusions and postoperative complications, such as
mortality, AKI, graft failure, and pulmonary and
infection-related complications.6-9 In our study, we
observed potential effects of fluid management on
important postoperative outcomes that should be further
explored. Observational cohort studies suggested an
association between hypotension and the need for high
doses of vasopressors and increased postoperative
complications. The potentially confounding effects of
vasopressor requirement and fluid management strategies
on outcome merits further research in this population.
This review has some limitations. The major limitation
is the small number of RCTs and the overall limited quality
of evidence. Most RCTs (five out of seven) had a high RoB
and most of the observed effects were from these studies.
Although we identified many observational studies, most of
them had either a high or critical RoB, and were beforeafter studies that did not adjust for temporal effects; these
did not improve our level of certainty. We included all
types of protocols and perioperative periods, with inherent
clinical diversity and between-studies variability. Results
came mostly from intraoperative studies, and so there is
limited information regarding postoperative interventions.
Differential effects associated with various fluid
management protocols or periods of intervention
(intraoperative vs postoperative) on any outcome had to
be obtained from several subgroup meta-analyses; the
multiple statistical testing could indicate a ‘‘significant’’
effect simply by chance alone. Nonetheless, most of our
124 F. M. Carrier et al.
123

findings were statistically significant using a very
conservative adjustment for multiple statistical testing on
secondary outcomes. Statistical heterogeneity was also
explained by our subgroup analyses and our results were
consistent across outcomes, strengthening the robustness of
our findings. The main strength of this review is the
thorough evaluation of the currently available evidence by
a very systematic approach that limits the chances of
missing any important study reporting at least one
clinically significant postoperative outcome. Another
strength is that we assessed the RoB with two novel tools
recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration.
Clinical equipoise on the best fluid management strategy
to adopt in this population still remains and high-quality
data are needed to improve perioperative quality of care in
these patients. Outcomes such as intraoperative bleeding,
duration of MV, ICU LOS, and pulmonary complications
seemed to be improved by a restrictive fluid management
strategy and should be included in future research outcome
studies. We strongly suggest that hemodynamic goals be
integrated into any future RCT concerned with a fluid
management protocol in liver transplant recipients.
Based on low or very low levels of evidence, we did not
observe any association between restrictive fluid
management strategies and AKI. Nevertheless,
intraoperative restrictive fluid management strategies
might have protective effects on other clinical outcomes,
such as blood loss, duration of MV, ICU LOS, and
pulmonary complications. This review will help to guide
the design of future clinical trials concerned with the
optimal perioperative fluid management strategy for
patients undergoing liver transplantation.
