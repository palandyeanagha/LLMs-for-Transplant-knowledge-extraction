Abstract
Background: Patients with suspected alcoholic hepatitis and a Discriminant Function ≥32 underwent liver biopsy
to confirm the diagnosis. Of these (n = 58), 43 had histological features of alcoholic hepatitis and 15 (25%) did not.
We aimed to determine the laboratory features that differentiated those patients with a histological diagnosis of
alcoholic hepatitis from those without, and assess potential clinical utility.
Methods: Laboratory investigations at presentation for each of the histologically confirmed cases of alcoholic
hepatitis (n = 43) were compared to those without (n = 15) to determine whether there were differences between
the two groups. Univariate analysis was by Mann Whitney U Test and Multivariate analysis was by a stepwise
approach.
Results: White cell count (16.2 ± 10.5 v 6.9 ± 3.5 (× 109
/L); p = 0.0001) and platelet count (178 ± 81 v 98.4 ± 43
(× 109
/L); p = 0.0005) were higher in the patients with histological features of alcoholic hepatitis than in those
without. The area under the ROC curve for AH diagnosis was estimated to be 0.83 (0.73, 0.94) and 0.81 (0.69, 0.93)
for white cell count and platelet count respectively.
Conclusions: Clinicians cannot accurately differentiate patients with or without alcoholic hepatitis without liver
biopsy. This is critically important when deciding on specific therapies such as corticosteroids or when interpreting
data from future trials in which biopsy is not mandated. In situations where liver biopsy is unsuitable or unavailable
the white cell and platelet counts can be used to determine the likelihood of histological alcoholic hepatitis and
guide treatment.

Background
Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is defined by a constellation of
histological abnormalities. These consist of liver cell damage (in the form of ballooning degeneration), a neutrophil
inflammatory cell infiltrate, Mallory bodies and pericellular
fibrosis [1]. This fibrosis characteristically commences in
the perivenular zone [2] and has a “chicken wire appearance”. These histological features are associated with a
clinical syndrome of alcoholic hepatitis, but the severity of
the clinical syndrome does not closely reflect the severity
of the histology. The clinical syndrome can be mild with
non-specific symptoms and mild liver transaminase abnormalities, or severe with jaundice, ascites and encephalopathy [3,4].
Prognosis in alcoholic hepatitis correlates with the severity of the underlying histological lesion [5,6]. In severe cases, however, this prognostic information is hard
to obtain as transabdominal liver biopsy is precluded on
the grounds of coagulopathy associated with the liver
failure. Transjugular liver biopsy is an alternative but is
not always available. In addition, it has a small but definite mortality in this population [7-9]. For this reason,
prognostic scores based on clinical parameters such as

the prothrombin time, bilirubin, white cell count and
renal function have been developed [10,11]. These are
now used in many units to make treatment decisions, particularly to decide whether to give the patient corticosteroids or not. The clinical utility of these scores means that
many physicians do not confirm the diagnosis of alcoholic
hepatitis with biopsy but treat according to Maddrey’s
Discriminant Function (DF) [10] or the Glasgow Alcoholic
Hepatitis Score [11] This has a pragmatic attraction, particularly in centres where transjugular liver biopsy is not
available. There is a concern however that some cases that
are treated are not alcoholic hepatitis at all but decompensated cirrhosis. The outcome of these patients when
treated with steroids is not known.
In this study, our aims were to report on the frequency
with which the clinical diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis is
inaccurate and to determine if there were any clinical differences between the group with or without alcoholic
hepatitis on biopsy. We also sought to assess the clinical
utility of any observed differences between the two groups.
Methods
Patients with suspected alcoholic hepatitis and a DF ≥ 32
underwent liver biopsy to “confirm” alcoholic hepatitis.
Most of these patients underwent biopsy prior to entry
into a randomized controlled trial of antioxidants versus
placebo in alcoholic hepatitis, which was carried out in
the Freeman Hospital Liver Unit in Newcastle upon
Tyne, UK [12]. The inclusion criteria were a recent history of alcohol excess, jaundice and a discriminant function ≥32 [13]. Exclusion criteria were active infection,
spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, upper GI bleed and
previous cardiac or respiratory disease [12]. All patients
that fulfilled the criteria were biopsied to confirm or refute the clinical suspicion of alcoholic hepatitis [12].
Some patients were subsequently excluded because they
had no histological features of alcoholic hepatitis. To increase patient numbers we have included patients subsequently admitted to our unit who were biopsied to
investigate presumed alcoholic hepatitis and were found
not to have the relevant histological features, using the
same criteria.
Laboratory data (full blood count, serum bilirubin, liver
enzymes, prothrombin time (PT), creatinine and albumin)
from the time of admission were collected. From these
data, the Child-Pugh Score [13] and Discriminant Function
[10] were derived. Liver biopsies were reviewed, classified
and staged by an expert pathologist (ADB) according to
criteria published previously [1].
Descriptive statistics are provided as the mean (±SD),
median and range or percentage for quantitative and
qualitative variables, respectively. Comparisons between
groups were performed with the Mann–Whitney U test.
For multivariate analysis a stepwise approach was used.
Fisher’s exact test was used to test the association of
histological stage with presence of histological AH. A p
value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis
was used to assess the utility of White Cell Count and
Platelet Count in the diagnosis of AH. IBM SPSS 17 was
used to perform all analyses.
Patients gave written informed consent for entry into
the trial. Ethics for the original antioxidant trial was
granted by Newcastle and North Tyneside Local Ethics
Committee [12]; research was conducted in compliance
with the Helsinki Declaration.
Results
The main characteristics of the 58 patients are given in
Table 1. Of these, 49 patients were included from the
original antioxidant study, with 9 additional patients identified subsequently. From these 58, 43 (74%) had histological features of alcoholic hepatitis and 15 were found to
be cirrhotic with no histological features of alcoholic
hepatitis. Of the 43 patients with histological features of
alcoholic hepatitis, 35 (81%) were found to be cirrhotic.
Histological features of the 58 patients are given in Table 2.
Lab indices according to fibrosis stage are given in Table 3.
Diagnoses of 12 patients without histological features of
alcoholic hepatitis were spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,
pneumonia, sepsis of unknown source or GI bleed. In the
remaining three patients no clear diagnosis could be made
other than end stage alcoholic cirrhosis.
White cell count (16.2 ± 10.5 v 6.9 ± 3.5 (×109
/L); p =
0.0001) and platelet count (178 ± 81 v 98.4 ± 43 (× 109
/L);
p = 0.0005) were higher in the patients with histological
features of alcoholic hepatitis than in those with none.
Both clinical parameters remained significant on multivariate analysis.
Using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve approach, we next calculated potential
cut-off values to separate patients with AH from those
without AH based on White Cell Count and Platelet
Count. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was estimated to be 0.83 (0.73, 0.94) (Figure 1) for white cell
count and 0.81 (0.69, 0.93) for platelet count (Figure 2).
We chose a cut off of 10.75 × 109
/L for white cell count
and 147.5 × 109
/L for platelet count for further analysis. A
white cell count of > 10.75 × 109
/L had a sensitivity of 65%
and a specificity of 93% for detecting AH (PPV 97% and
NPV 48%). A platelet count of >147.5 × 109
/L had a sensitivity of 56% and a specificity of 93% (PPV 96% and NPV
56%). A white cell count > 10.75 × 109
/L and a platelet
count of >147.5 × 109
/L was seen in 19 patients and had a
sensitivity of 44% and a specificity of 100% for detecting
AH (PPV 100% and NPV 38%).
We then chose a cut off of 5.95 × 109
/L for white cell
count and 86 × 109
/L for platelet count to determine a

cut off below which we could accurately detect patients
without AH. A white cell count of <5.95 × 109
/L had a
sensitivity of 47% and a specificity of 93% for detecting
patients that did not have AH (PPV 70% and NPV 83%).
A platelet count of <86 × 109
/L had a sensitivity of 47%
and a specificity of 93% (PPV 64% and NPV 83%). A
white cell count <5.95 × 109
/L and a platelet count
<86 × 109
/L had a sensitivity of 45% and a specificity of
98% for detecting those patient without AH (PPV 87.5%
and NPV 83%).
By using both upper and lower cut-off values we were
able to develop an algorithm (Figure 3), which could be
used to avoid (transjugular) liver biopsy in 24/58 patients while maintaining good diagnostic accuracy.
Fishers exact test was non significant (p = 0.08) in determining an association between fibrosis stage and
presence of AH on biopsy. Only WCC remained statistically significant (p = 0.0084) when groups were analysed
according to fibrosis stage (see Table 3).
Discussion
For pragmatic reasons, treatment decisions are often
made without liver biopsy in those patients with suspected
severe alcoholic hepatitis. These reasons include the availability and safety of transjugular liver biopsy. They also reflect the trials of therapy in severe alcoholic hepatitis.
While there have been positive trials of steroids where all
patients were biopsied [14], there have also been positive
studies where biopsy was not a requirement [15]. This
leaves the hepatology community in two camps regarding
the importance of biopsy, and this is reflected in practice
guidelines where precise indications for liver biopsy are
not well established [16-18]. Recent EASL Guidelines recognise that many centres rely on clinical criteria, and do
not consider biopsy as routine practise. However the guidance includes biopsy in the therapeutic algorithm and
recommends that it should be considered in high risk patients according to prognostic assessment with Maddrey’s
for example [18].
We wanted to know the frequency with which a patient with a clinical presentation suspicious of alcoholic
hepatitis and a DF > 32 had alcoholic hepatitis on liver
biopsy. In addition, we wanted to know whether laboratory factors could be used to improve accuracy.
We found that 74% of patients with a high clinical suspicion of alcoholic hepatitis had this confirmed histologically. Had the group not undergone biopsy, 25% (n = 15)
of the total number would have undergone specific treatment without having the clinical condition the treatment
was specifically targeted to. This supports the conclusions
of the EASL guideline for the use of liver biopsy in the setting of alcoholic hepatitis.
When we analysed the laboratory features at presentation we found two interesting findings. The first is that the
group with alcoholic hepatitis on liver biopsy had a higher
platelet count (178 ± 81 v 98.4 ± 43 (× 109
/L); p = 0.0005)

than those without alcoholic hepatitis. This is likely to be
due to the fact that patients with no AH have more advanced fibrotic liver disease with portal hypertension leading to decompensation. The second was that the group
with alcoholic hepatitis on liver biopsy had a higher mean
white cell count (16.2 ± 10.5 v 6.9 ± 3.5 (× 109
/L); p =
0.0001). Using a cut off value of >10.75 × 109
/L for white
cell count and >147.5 × 109
/L for platelet count, accurately
diagnoses AH with a combined specificity 100%. A lower
boundary of <5.95 × 109
/L and <86 × 109/L for white cell
count and platelet count respectively, accurately rules out
AH as a diagnosis with a combined sensitivity of 98%.
There are two important clinical ramifications of this
finding. The first is that there should be suspicion regarding labelling patients with a normal white cell count as alcoholic hepatitis. The second is that alcoholic hepatitis is
an inflammatory condition and a high white cell count is
entirely in keeping with this. A raised white cell count
should not therefore be used as a reason not to give treatment because of concerns about infection when there are
no other features of overt sepsis.
Together these laboratory tests may help the clinician
to make a decision about whom to biopsy; particularly if
this means sending them to another hospital. We would
advise caution in making a diagnosis of acute alcoholic
hepatitis, regardless of the clinical presentation in any

patient with a normal white cell count, particularly if
this is associated with a very low platelet count.
The majority of the patients in our study were cirrhotic 50/58 (86%). As expected, all 15 of the patients
that were found to not have alcoholic hepatitis on liver
biopsy were cirrhotic. These are the patients that
progressed to decompensation due to very advanced
liver disease rather than superimposed hepatitis. 8/43
patients with AH were non-cirrhotic; all of these were
F3. When we compared laboratory indices between the
cirrhotic patients and the non-cirrhotic patients we
found the only statistically significant finding to be the
difference in average WCC. This is largely due to the
fact that the F4 cohort contained all the patients that did
not have histological alcoholic hepatitis.
Our results suggest that in future clinical trials where
biopsy is not mandated, 25% of patients maybe falsely
included. This clearly has implications for the validity
and reliability of data testing specific therapies in patients whom may not suffer from the disease they are
targeted to; this is reflected in the EASL Clinical Practical Guideline in Alcohol whereby performing liver biopsy prior to trial commencement is recommended.
What is needed now are data from large prospective
studies where biopsy is included in the diagnostic algorithm but where patients are included in the therapeutic
study regardless of the result. This will help to elucidate
the response of the patient presenting with the alcoholic
hepatitis syndrome but a non-confirmatory biopsy to
standard of care treatment. Should these studies show
that treatment is detrimental to this group, biopsy
should in future be mandated prior to commencing
treatment. In situations where transjugular biopsy is impractical or simply unavailable the surrogate markers of
white cell count and platelet count may prove to be of
great use in determining which patients receive treatment.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have shown that the diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis is difficult on clinical grounds; we have
also found two clinical parameters that can assist the
clinician with the diagnosis. This may in time prove to
be very useful when determining treatment strategies.
