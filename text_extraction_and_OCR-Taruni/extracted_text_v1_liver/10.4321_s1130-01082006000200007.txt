INTRODUCTION
Since the modifications introduced by Menghini in
1957 (1,2) regarding the technique for liver biopsy collection, the use of this procedure has become widespread,
which has allowed a better understanding of the pathology and course of liver diseases, and the basing of our diagnoses on objective, pathologic grounds. Presently, liver
biopsy is considered a procedure indicated: a) to establish
the origin of abnormal liver tests; b) to assess activity extent and stage in chronic hepatitis; c) to evaluate alcoholrelated liver disease; d) to study fever of unknown origin;
e) in the diagnosis of multisystemic infiltrating and granulomatous diseases; f) to evaluate cholestatic conditions;
g) in the diagnosis of neoplasm; h) in the assessment of
drug-induced liver lesions; i) in the diagnosis of hereditary metabolic disease; j) in the assessment of response to
therapy; k) in the evaluation of the liver following a liver
transplantation; and l) to evaluate obscure jaundice, acute
hepatitis, and hepatomegaly (3).
The etiologic identification of liver conditions using noninvasive methods has advanced a lot in recent years, and
markers to reveal the extent and stage of liver disease have
been sought. Such achievements have begun to question the
absolute need for liver biopsy before treatment onset. 
Indeed, most liver conditions are defined by histologic
lesions; however, considering that the material obtained
with this technique usually represents as little as
1/100,000 to 1/30,000 of the whole organ, representativity is arguable. Classic studies demonstrated that the information obtained from such biopsies was not reliable in
the diagnosis of liver cirrhosis. For instance, Maharaj et
al. (4) failed to identify this disease in 50% of patients.
Abdi et al. (5) were more successful and recognized cirrhosis in 80% of cases. Poniachik et al. (6) histologically
identified cirrhosis in only 68% of laparoscopic cirrhoses, and detected this disease in only 0.8% of cases
overlooked by laparoscopy. The uncertainty of histologic
diagnosis is also apparent when results obtained from
two biopsies in one liver, one each from the right and left
lobules, are compared, with 25-33% of cases showing
relevant differences (7,8). A great part of diagnostic limitations regarding liver biopsy result from the small size
of samples obtained by percutaneous puncture. Several
studies demonstrating that diagnostic reliability depends
on sample size have been reported in recent years. In a
study including 161 liver biopsies, Colloredo et al. (9)
found that the shorter or thinner the sample fragment, the
more benign were inflammation extent and fibrosis stage
interpreted to be. In the opinion of these authors, a correct assessment of histologic lesions required 11 portal
spaces at least, and this was achieved only when biopsy
samples were 2-cm long and 1.5-mm wide. Conclusions
reached in the study by Badossa et al. (10) raised sample
length to 2.5 cm, and Hohlund et al. (11) reduced it to 1.5 cm
when using a 18g needle.
Difficulties derived from assessment subjectivity add
to those mentioned on representativity. Various studies
have shown great variability in lesion interpretation
among pathologists (interobserver variability) and even
in one single pathologist when assessing one sample at
two different times (intraobserver variability). In a recent
study, Petz et al. (12) showed that interobserver variabiliCurrent indications of liver biopsy

POINT OF VIEW

ty was 58%, and intraobserver variability was 56%. In
39-46% of cases, differences in activity extent reached 1
point, and two or more points in 12-17% of patients. Differences regarding stage assessment were 1 stage in 27-
44% of patients, and 2 or more stages in 12-19% of patients. In the METAVIR study, samples were examined
by 10 different pathologists, all of them experts in liver
pathology, and while some lesions were assessed in a superimposable manner by all, other items revealed severe
differences. These included erosive necrosis, activity,
lobular necrosis, and Knodell index (13). In the study by
Westin et al. (14), comparing the interpretations of lesions by three different pathologists, coincidences
amounted to 84%; however, the authors were more tolerant in this study, and accepted differences up to 1 point as
coincident diagnoses. 
Obviously, liver biopsy is not a harmless test. It is usually painful (30%) and may originate serious complications (0.3%), including bleeding and biliary peritonitis,
which may be even fatal (0.03%) (15,16). This precludes
repeat procedures as frequently as desired to gain insight
into disease progression or assess therapy response. 
All the above questions the absolute value usually
granted to liver biopsy in the diagnosis of liver disease,
and hence the need for a risky, painful, anxiogenic, and
costly test. Therefore, we should wonder whether this diagnosis may be reached without recourse to biopsy.
Based on the study by Spycher et al. (17) we may answer
that this is certainly possible on most occasions. In 365
patients these authors reported that biopsy confirmed the
previous diagnosis in 84.4% of cases. Only in 6.8% of
patients did biopsy demonstrate lesions other than those
expected. Biopsy most commonly contributed to point at
the nature of lesions (8.8%), besides the confirmation of
suspected diagnoses, (8,8%) or to add further data
(steatosis, siderosis, granulomas, etc.) of potential prognostic or therapeutic interest (10.5%). Similar conclusions were arrived at by other groups of authors (18-20).
The presence of liver steatosis is a major factor in the
progression of hepatitis C (21,22). Liver biopsy alone
may assure on steatosis absence. Similarly, the presence
of iron in the liver may only be detected with a liver biopsy. Its presence has been associated with disease progression and response to antiviral therapy (23,24). The frequency of previous diagnosis modifications by liver
biopsy in this study is similar to that found by other authors
(25-27) in their studies. Pre-biopsy diagnostic accuracy
results from the fact that many tests are currently available for the diagnosis of liver disease with no need for
biopsy. Such is the case of viral, autoimmune, and metabolic hepatitis, non-alcoholic fatty liver, primary biliary
cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and commonly
toxic-related liver disease. Interestingly, diseases unidentifiable without a biopsy procedure are those who less often may benefit from treatment (25). 
Here I will review the need for liver biopsy in the assessment of patients with the three most common problems in our setting: a) viral hepatitis; b) alcohol-related
liver disease; and c) non-alcoholic fatty liver.
LIVER BIOPSY FOR CHRONIC VIRAL LIVER
DISEASE
Chronic hepatitis C
Arguments supporting liver biopsy in patients with
chronic viral hepatitis include: a) liver biopsy allows a
definitive diagnosis and rules out other conditions; b) assesses lesion significance and prognosis, and therapy urgency; and c) helps predict response to therapy. Several
consensus meetings held during the late 1990s (26-31)
recommended the routine performance of liver biopsy
procedures before antiviral therapy onset. Such need was
determined by a low response rate to antiviral therapy.
However, ever since the conclusions of the first meeting
were reported, voices questioning this need arose, and in
the French Consensus Conference in 2002, as well as in
the Guidelines issued by the American Association for
the Study of Liver Diseases it was decided that liver
biopsy was no mandatory requirement for treatment
(32,33). 
A relevant argument supporting liver biopsy in patients
with chronic hepatitis C is that it allows the assessment of
lesion significance, and hence disease prognosis and the
urgency of therapy onset. No doubt, liver biopsy is the
most effective means to assess the condition’s process rate
(necroinflammatory activity grade) and progression phase
(stage). Biopsy is obviously warranted when decisive information regarding therapy may be obtained, which cannot be collected by other means. Treatment urgency and
need will not be the same for advanced-stage disease (F3-
F4) with severe necroinflammatory activity, and for minimal activity and fibrosis. The question is whether this information may be obtained without a biopsy. This is a
topic that has drawn researchers’ attention during the last
decade. Patient symptoms and physical examination findings are of little value because they are only present when
liver disease is already advanced. ALT will not reveal disease evolutionary stage; however, when elevated, it suggests a potentially progressive activity requiring treatment
(34). In contrast, in patients with persistently normal ALT
values lesions are considered usually as early, with no activity or tendency to progression (35-38). For such reasons,
when ALT is elevated in patients with hepatitis C an antiviral therapy will be likely necessary regardless of histologic lesions. In contrast, when ALT is persistently normal
biopsy usually reveals minimal changes (39) with little activity or progression (37,40-43), and thus both liver biopsy
and treatment have been considered unnecessary. However, all studies show a small proportion of patients with normal ALT levels where biopsy reveals advanced lesions
(34). Similarly, in some patients with elevated ALT
(24.5%) (34) biopsy reveals scarcely evolved changes

(F0-F1), and antiviral therapy would be neither needed nor
urgent. The study by Pradat et al. (34) found up to 13% of
patients who despite showing normal transaminase levels
had advanced fibrosis stages (F ≥ 2) or even liver cirrhosis.
These not always were inactive, scarring lesions, as even
among those with an F1 stage 24% had moderate to severe
necroinflammatory activity, and hence progressive disease
requiring therapy. That is, if these patients had not undergone a biopsy because of their normal ALT, a significant
amount of patients in need of treatment would have received none. In contrast, liver biopsy in patients with elevated ALT almost consistently showed F ≥ 1 fibrosis
stages, and F ≥ 2 stages in 75% of cases. That is, in such
cases patient treatment would be almost always warranted
despite the absence of liver biopsy. The logical consequence of this study is that biopsy is likely not essential before treatment onset in patients with elevated ALT, but it is
in patients with normal ALT values. If biopsy confirms
that lesions and necroinflammatory activity are mild, therapy would not be required. On the contrary, therapy would
be required for advanced stages and moderate to severe activity. Other studies advocate for treating patients with elevated transaminase levels even in the absence of an ensuring biopsy. In the study by Ghany et al. (44), ALT
elevations beyond five times the upper normal limit were
associated with a yearly fibrosis progression of 0.96
stages, which means that cirrhosis may develop in five
years. Therefore, who may doubt that these patients should
be treated, and that such decision may be made in the absence of a biopsy procedure? In the study by Marcellin et
al. (45), this accelerated course of disease is also seen in
patients with ALT values twice above normal.
The need for biopsy to decide therapy is based on its
capacity to discern between different disease stages and
the various inflammatory activity grades, mainly between F0-F1 and F ≥ 2. Is such distinction possible in the
absence of liver biopsy? When chronic hepatitis C is advanced and cirrhosis has already developed, laboratory
parameters may probably show changes raising suspicion
of this lesion. Such is the case with an AST/ALT ratio
above 1 (40,45,46), and with decreased platelet rates or
prothrombin activity (47), which in various studies predict the presence of liver cirrhosis. These are signs with
low sensitivity even though their specificity may be high.
In the last few years special attention has been paid to
the search for markers able to identify liver disease stage,
and hence patients most in need for etiologic therapy.
Various extracellular matrix breakdown or synthesis
byproducts, and a number of enzymes involved in matrix
metabolism have been assessed in this respect [laminin,
procollagen type-III amino-terminal peptide (PIIINP),
hyaluronic acid, collagen IV, metalloproteinases (MMP1, MMP-2, MMP-9), tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP-1, TIMP-2), etc.]. Amongst these, those
with seemingly a higher predictive value for fibrosis include (SE, 10-88%; SP, 59-100%) and laminin (SE 57-
80%; SP, 78-85%) (48). PIIINP sensitivity (SE) oscillated from 24 to 89%, and specificity (SP) from 38 to 88%
(48). Despite this, results obtained with the use of single
markers are not satisfactory, and thus marker combinations have been sought to better discriminate between the
various stages of chronic hepatitis. Several markers have
been proposed, and overall it may be concluded that these
allow to adequately distinguish early from advanced
stages in chronic hepatitis, but poorly discriminate between intermediate stages. For example, combining
MMP-2, collagen IV 7S fragment, and hyaluronic acid
may reveal absent or minimal fibrosis with an SE of 68%
and SP of 73% (48). Multivariate models have allowed to
recognize up to 94% of patients with liver cirrhosis (49).
An age- and sex-adjusted index including α2-macroglobulin, haptoglobin, total bilirubin, GGT, and apolipoprotein A1 (FibroTest) [4.467 x log α2-macroglobulin (g/L) -
1.357 x log haptoglobin (g/L) + 1.017 x log GGT (UI/L)
+ 0.0281 x age (years) + 1.737 x log bilirubin (µmol/L) -
1.184 x apolipoprotein A1 (g/L) + 0.301 x sex (female =
0; male = 1) -5.540] (50) was highly capable in excluding
moderate and severe fibrosis grades (F2, F3, F4) [negative predictive value (NPV) when lower than 0.31 was
91%], that is, patients requiring therapy. Similarly, when
this index is above 0.72 said fibrosis grades may be predicted (PPV, 76%) with great accuracy. By adding serum
ALT to FibroTest these same authors developed an additional index (ActiTest) for the recognition of necroinflammatory activity extent. When necroinflammatory activity
is mild, this index is lower (0.26 ± 0.20) than for moderate (0.5 ± 0.24) or severe (0.59 ± 0.17) activity. ActiTest
NPV and PPV are 85 and 77%, respectively, when cutoffs are 0.36 and 0.60, respectively (51). Forns et al. proposed another simple model that also allows the exclusion of advanced fibrosis stages. This model considers
platelet count, blood GGT and cholesterol rates, and age
[7.811 – 3.131 x ln platelets (109
/L) + 0.781 x ln GGT
(UI/L) + 3.467 x ln age (years) -0.014 cholesterol
(mg/dl)] (52). More recently the European Group for the
Study of Liver Fibrosis developed another index also including age, hyaluronic acid, PIIINP, and TIMP-1, which
has proven highly capable of discriminating liver fibrosis
extent both in viral hepatitis and alcohol-related liver disease, as well as in non-alcoholic liver steatosis [-0.014 x
ln age (years) + 0.616 x ln hyaluronic acid (ng/ml) +
0.586 x ln PIIINP (ng/ml) + 0.472 x ln TIMP-1 (ng/dl) -
6.38]. NPV for indices lower than 0.063 in the exclusion
of advanced fibrosis stages was 94.9%, and PPV for indices higher than 0.56 in the acknowledgment of advanced fibrosis was 83.3% (53). Finally, a system recognizing the amount of fibrous tissue based on organ
rigidity (Fibroscan) was developed to identify liver fibrosis stage. Its usefulness has been recently assessed by two
research teams (54,55), and it seemingly discriminates
adequately between patients with and without cirrhosis.
For rigidity values higher than 14.6, PPV is 78% and
NPV is 97%. The optimum value to differentiate absent
or mild fibrosis (F0, F1) from advanced fibrosis was 8.8,
124 J. A. SOLÍS HERRUZO REV ESP ENFERM DIG (Madrid)
REV ESP ENFERM DIG 2006; 98(2): 122-139

and a PPV and NPV of 88% and 56% were obtained, respectively. In general, these methods manage to distinguish advanced from initial fibrosis stages, but discrimination between intermediate stages is poor. They are
particularly unreliable to differentiate between stages F1
and F2, and hence to separate patients requiring treatment
from those who do not need it. Castéra’s group suggests
that liver biopsy may be disregarded when FibroTest and
Fibroscan results are in agreement (55). This situation develops in 70 to 80% of patients. In such cases, liver biopsy results are usually consistent with those obtained with
these two noninvasive tests (55). Therefore, it may be too
early to affirm that liver biopsy may be dispensed with in
the workup of patients more in need of therapy; however,
tests are being developed that bring hope that such identification will be possible in the forthcoming years.
Another argument for biopsy performance in patients
with chronic hepatitis C is that it helps predict whether
patients will respond to antiviral therapy. There is
enough evidence to confirm that patients with more advanced lesions are less likely to respond to treatment
when compared to patients with milder lesions (48).
However, patients with advanced lesions are precisely
those more in need for treatment, as they will more easily
develop liver cirrhosis. Therefore, the decision to treat
patients cannot be solely based on biopsy results. According to these, patients with early lesions should receive treatment given they are more likely to respond. Patients with advanced lesions should also be treated in
view of their greater risk for liver cirrhosis. 
From all the above, the indication of liver biopsy for
hepatitis C should be currently applied on an individual
basis. For instance, biopsy may be disregarded: a) in case
of patient refusal (32,33). It is no longer acceptable that
therapy is conditioned by biopsy results, and therefore
treatment cannot be denied based on the availability of a
histology study; b) in case of treatment delay. In such
cases, biopsy, if needed, will be performed as close as
possible to treatment onset; c) in patients infected by
genotypes 2 and 3. In these patients treatment is mandatory no matter the lesion’s nature, since probabilities for
sustained viral response are in excess of 70%; d) when
therapy indication is not liver disease itself [infected
healthcare staff, infected mothers-to-be, cryoglobulinemia, HCV/HIV coinfection (32)]. In the latter case antiviral therapy is recommended regardless of liver lesions to
prevent side-effects from dual anti-HCV and anti-HIV
medication; e) non-invasive tests clearly suggest lesion
type. For example, several tests are consistent regarding
fibrosis stage assessment; and f) when ALT is elevated,
mainly above five-fold the normal value. In contrast, liver biopsy is indicated and of help for decision making
when: a) the patient is infected by genotype-1 hepatitis C;
b) when ALT is normal or scarcely elevated; c) when
non-invasive tests are inconclusive regarding disease
stage; d) the patient wishes treatment to be based on precise knowledge regarding lesion severity; e) in the presence of factors predicting poor response to treatment
(very high viral load; obesity; insulin resistance); and f)
before treatment withdrawal in a patient with no biopsy
when tolerance is poor. In the latter two instances, treatment may be spared when lesions are mild. Obviously,
when antiviral medications sufficiently effective against
infection by HCV most resistant genotypes become
available, liver biopsy indications for chronic hepatitis C
will dramatically decrease.
Chronic hepatitis B
Liver biopsy has been recommended in chronic hepatitis
B before antiviral therapy onset in order to confirm the
chronic hepatitis B diagnosis, to identify other causes of
liver disease, and to assess necroinflammatory activity
grade and disease stage (56,57). The latter issues are of
prognostic interest (58), may determine therapy, and ultimately may predict response to treatment (59). However, a
chronic hepatitis B diagnosis may be reached in the absence
of biopsy. Indeed, such diagnosis is warranted for patients
remaining HBsAg-positive for more than six months, with
high HBV-DNA levels [(above 105
copies/ml (20,000
IU/mL) or, under selected circumstances, 104
copies/ml
(2000 IU/mL)] and inflammatory activity. Several studies
have shown that such viral load allows differentiation between patients with inactive disease who do not require
therapy, and patients with active disease in need of treatment (56,60,61). Serum ALT elevations are considered a
marker of necroinflammatory activity (62). In this infection, liver biopsy should be warranted when the information it may provide may impact therapeutic decisions. 
Chronic infection by HBV may impact patients in various ways, resulting in differing diagnostic and therapeutic attitudes.
In some cases patients are HBsAg carriers only.
HBeAg is negative, anti-HBe antibodies are positive,
HBV-DNA load is very low or non-detectable, and blood
ALT levels are normal. These patients are chronic, inactive HBsAg carriers. In them, biopsy is not warranted and
neither is treatment. In cases when these patients underwent a biopsy procedure, a lack of necroinflammatory activity was confirmed. Nothing but surveillance every 6 to
12 months should be attempted in these patients. 
Other patients, besides being HBsAg-positive, are
HBeAg carriers; blood HBV-DNA levels are fairly high
(>107
-1010 copies/ml or 2 x 106to 2 x 109IU/mL), and serum
ALT levels are normal. These patients are immunotolerant
to HBV. While some controversy exists on what should be
done in such cases, it is considered that they should undergo
neither biopsy nor treatment. Biopsy usually reveals the
presence of minimal, if any, necroinflammatory activity
(56,63), and antiviral therapy is commonly ineffective (59).
These patients should be periodically followed every 6 to 12
months for loss of immunotolerance. This will be recognized from increased transaminase levels.
Vol. 98. N.° 2, 2006 CURRENT INDICATIONS OF LIVER BIOPSY 125
REV ESP ENFERM DIG 2006; 98(2): 122-139

Some patients with active chronic hepatitis B are
HBeAg carriers, and have negative anti-HBe antibodies,
blood HBV-DNA levels higher than 105
copies/mL
(> 20,000 IU/mL) and high transaminase titers. These
patients would require antiviral therapy. However, response to therapy relates to blood ALT levels. For elevations smaller than 2 times the upper normal limit, response probabilities with HBeAg (+) to anti-HBe (+)
seroconversion are low (5%). In contrast, when ALT rises
2- to 5-fold, seroconversion is reached in 26%, and for elevations in excess of 5 times the upper normal limit response rates go up to 64% of cases (59). Given this, antiviral therapy with no need for liver biopsy is warranted
for ALT values above 2-fold the upper normal limit. If a
biopsy is performed, it will confirm the presence of
necroinflammatory activity, and the progressive nature of
disease. In contrast, for ALT elevations smaller than
2-fold, response probabilities with HBeAg seroconversion are scarce, and indefinite antiviral therapy will likely
be required. On the other hand, inflammatory activity is
usually low. Hence, therapy should be warranted in terms
of lesion progression before onset, and this can only be
assessed with a biopsy. If biopsy reveals that grade and
stage remain below 2, treatment can wait. If these histologic markers reveal an active, progressive disease, antiviral therapy is mandatory. Therefore, a biopsy should
be performed for serum ALT levels smaller than 2-fold
the upper limit of normal. Liver biopsy is not essential for
values higher than this limit, and patients may be treated
without it. If seroconversion is not achieved by treatment,
a liver biopsy should be performed prior to indefinite
maintenance, in order to assess whether lesion severity
warrants it. Appropriate interpretation of such biopsies
requires having in mind that antiviral therapy transiently
improves lesions, even if it will not reach viral eradication (64). 
A final group of patients with chronic hepatitis B lack
HBeAg and carry anti-HBe antibodies, as do inactive
HBsAg carriers, but blood HBV-DNA and ALT rates are
high. Blood HBV-DNA levels associated with disease activity are usually lower than those seen in HBeAg (+)
chronic hepatitis B (62). In such cases, cut-off viremia to
discriminate active from inactive disease is 104
copies/mL (2000 IU/mL). In these chronic hepatitis
forms, normal transaminase levels do not ensure disease
inactivity, and thus ALT levels not always help assess
what patients should receive treatment and what patients
should not (62). However, if viremia is higher than 104
copies/mL (2000 IU/mL) and serum ALT levels are
greater than 2-fold the upper limit of normal, disease may
be presumed to be active, and patients should receive indefinite therapy with no need for liver biopsy. In contrast,
if blood ALT titers are smaller than twice the normal value, or within the normal range, but viral load is greater
than the aforementioned level, disease activity or progression cannot be excluded (65,66). A liver biopsy is required to assess this and then establish therapy needs. If
biopsy reveals moderate or severe activity or a stage
equal to or greater than F2, indefinite treatment is indicated. Treatment withdrawal and the development of antiviral drug resistance are automatically followed by an increase first in viral load and then in transaminase levels
(67). 
Fibrosis stage recognition using non-invasive methods
has also been attempted in chronic hepatitis B. Markers
evaluated include the abovementioned FibroTest. When
this test provides values below 0.20, severe fibrosis may
be fairly safely excluded (NPV, 92%). In contrast, when
FibroTest provides values above 0.80, advanced fibrosis
is a sure issue (F2-F4) (PPV, 92%) (68). If such data are
confirmed by other groups, and there is no particular interest in knowing hepatitis stage, liver biopsy could be
dispensed with in nearly 50% of patients with chronic hepatitis B, and restricted to patients with FibroTest results
between 0.20 and 0.80. Between these limits, this test
cannot appropriately discriminate lesion stage.
To summarize liver biopsy indications in chronic hepatitis B, it may be said it is recommended when
transaminase levels are low –below 2-fold normal– and
viral load is greater than 105
copies/ml (20,000 IU/ml) if
HBeAg is positive, and 104
copies/ml (2000 IU/ml) if
HBeAg is negative. Biopsy is not required for inactive
HBsAg carriers or immunotolerant individuals. Therapy
may be initiated in chronic hepatitis patients –with either
negative or positive HBeAg– without a previous liver
biopsy when transaminase levels are high.
LIVER BIOPSY IN ALCOHOLIC LIVER DISEASE
(ALD)
The need for liver biopsy in ALD has been based on its
potential to establish a diagnosis, and to assess the presence of lesions with prognostic value.
Studies performed in the 1970s showed that, among
drinkers with suspected ALD, liver biopsy revealed a
failed diagnosis and causes other than alcohol for hepatic
changes in 20% of patients (69). However, the study by
Levin et al., including patients who drank less than 80 g
alcohol/day, was performed when there were still no
means for hepatitis C recognition, and included patients
with transaminase levels that had not improved following
withdrawal for several months. In 1988, Talley et al.
found that pre-biopsy, clinical-laboratory diagnosis was
correct for only 71% of alcoholics, with a specificity of
79% and a sensitivity of 90%. Nevertheless, errors would
have been less common should laboratory workup have
been more exhaustive (70). In 1989, Van Ness and Diehl
(26) showed that sensitivity and PPV in the pre-biopsy
diagnosis of ALD were 91 and 88%, respectively, whereas specificity and NPV were 96 and 97%, respectively.
That is, according to the latter results, the presence or absence or ALD may be fairly certainly predicted based on
clinical and laboratory criteria alone. However, while al126 J. A. SOLÍS HERRUZO REV ESP ENFERM DIG (Madrid)
REV ESP ENFERM DIG 2006; 98(2): 122-139

coholic liver disease may be fairly confidently diagnosed
without recourse to liver biopsy, the latter may be required for diagnostic certainty (26,71-73) in atypical clinical-laboratory profiles, when a parameter raises suspicion of a different etiologic factor, and when liver
changes do not regress to normal after 3 to 6 months of
alcohol withdrawal. 
Liver biopsy is no doubt the most reliable test to identify lesions with prognostic value, specifically those of alcoholic hepatitis (AH). Sorensen et al. (74) found that the
presence of AH, lipogranulomas, and Mallory bodies is of
prognostic value and predicts the development of liver cirrhosis after 13 years in 50% of cases. Similarly, Marbet et
al. (75) showed that AH severity, fibrosis stage, presence
of sclerosing hyaline necrosis, and central vein sclerosis
predicted progression to cirrhosis in upcoming years. The
study by Chedid et al. (76), based on the analysis of 281 alcoholic subjects, found that 2-year survival was only 58%
when biopsy revealed AH, 49% when there was liver cirrhosis, and 35% for concurrent cirrhosis and AH. In almost
all studies AH is a first-order prognostic factor. However,
the clinical-laboratory diagnosis of AH is unreliable. Various studies have shown this diagnosis to be correct in only
10 to 15% of patients (77,78). Difficulties in recognizing
AH are particularly high in cirrhotic patients. In such cases, encephalopathy, ascites, reduced prothrombin activity,
and increased bilirubin may result from cirrhosis, not AH.
In addition, recognizing its presence is important to initiate
specific treatments (79-81). Therefore, a diagnosis of AH
most often requires a liver biopsy. However, many of these
patients have severe coagulation disturbances, and hence
biopsy may be particularly dangerous or contraindicated.
In such cases recourse to a transjugular biopsy may be had.
When using aspirating needles, the yield of this biopsy is
lower when compared to modern, TruCut-like needles
(82,83). Using the latter, average sample length is 1.2 cm
(0.2-2.0 cm), and portal space count is 8.8 (1-21 portal
spaces). Therefore, samples obtained through the transjugular route may be adequate for histologic assessment
in 71% of patients. Also for AH non-invasive methods
helping in the recognition of these lesions in patients with
ALD have been sought. In 80 patients with liver cirrhosis
and clinically suspected AH, Castéra et al. (84) found that
laminin and collagen IV recognized the presence of this lesion with a sensitivity of 90 and 87%, respectively, and a
specificity of 77 and 77%, respectively. This sensitivity
and specificity of laminin regarding AH has been also confirmed by Annoni et al. (85). PIIINP and collagens I and
III seem to be of lower diagnostic value regarding AH.
Liver biopsy is the safest test to assess ALD stage.
However, non-invasive markers allowing the assessment
of disease stage with no need for biopsy have also been
searched in this condition. PIIINP, collagens I, III and IV,
laminin, and YKN-40, a growth factor belonging to the
bacterial chitins class, all correlate with fibrosis, inflammation and necrosis extent in ALD, and have been suggested as markers for fibrosis stage; however, their diagnostic utility has not been well assessed (86-91). YKN-40
and PIIINP are associated with the presence of liver fibrosis, but stage discrimination is poor. Despite this, increased serum levels for these markers are associated
with poorer prognosis (90,91). Poynard et al. showed that
prothrombin activity, GGT, and apolipoprotein A1 (PGA
index) also fairly confidently predict cirrhosis in liver
biopsy samples. They applied this index in 333 alcoholic
patients, and showed that, when smaller than two, cirrhosis possibilities were nil, and normal or minimal-change
liver possibilities were 86%. In contrast, when this index
was above 9, cirrhosis probabilities were 86%, and normal or minimal-change liver probabilities were 0% (92).
When used in patients with ALD, FibroTest, developed
by this same team led by Poynard to assess liver fibrosis
stage, showed a sound discrimination between F0-F1 patients and F2-F4 patients, and thus, in these authors’
view, this test may contribute to a reduction in liver biopsy needs (93). An algorithm by Rosemberg et al. (53) also
effectively discriminates between patients with mild fibrosis and patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis.
Sensitivity and NPV for this index in the recognition of
F3 and F4 stages were both 100%. 
From all the above, it may be concluded that liver
biopsy is not essential in the diagnosis of ALD or the
recognition of most advanced liver fibrosis stages, but it
is for AH identification and when accurate data on disease stage are wanted.
LIVER BIOPSY IN NON-ALCOHOLIC FATTY
LIVER DISEASE (NAFLD)
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a most
common lesion in the West, represents a range of lesions
from simple fatty liver to so-called non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).
Liver biopsy is considered the gold standard in the diagnosis of this condition; as the latter is defined by strong
histologic criteria (liver steatosis, ballooning degeneration, inflammation in the absence of alcohol abuse) (94),
liver biopsy allows to differentiate this liver disease from
other liver conditions resulting in unexplained laboratory
changes, and is the only test to separate simple fatty liver
from NASH.
While ultrasonography has been known for years to
identify liver steatosis (95,96), the usefulness of imaging
techniques is limited. Saadeh et al. (97) showed that the
minimum amount of liver steatosis detectable by ultrasonography or axial tomography was 33%. For such
steatosis extent, these tests’ sensitivity was 100% and
93%, respectively, and PPV was 62 and 76%. That is,
these imaging techniques only detect moderate or severe
fatty degeneration. Laboratory tests are also unreliable in
the assessment of this condition (98). Its presence may be
presumed in the face of abnormal liver tests with no other
etiologic laboratory markers in a patient with metabolic

REV ESP ENFERM DIG 2006; 98(2): 122-139

syndrome (obesity, type-II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia). In a study including 81 patients with no etiologic markers for liver disease, biopsy
showed the presence of simple steatosis in 41 and of
steatohepatitis in 26 (99). That is, most patients of this
kind have NAFLD. These possibilities are even greater
when ultrasonography shows a glossy liver. In such cases, biopsy is not needed to confirm the diagnosis of
NAFLD. However, when suspected NASH is to be confirmed, having recourse to liver biopsy is mandatory. Ultrasonographic or radiographic signs of steatosis are absent for non-severe extents of fat deposition (100), and
NAFLD may exist in the absence of metabolic syndrome
signs. NAFLD is found in 2.4% of thin subjects (101). 
Even when there is a fair number of patients in whom
liver biopsy would be unnecessary to diagnose NAFLD,
this procedure would certainly be warranted to differentiate simple fatty liver from NASH. This differentiation is
relevant as fatty liver is considered a benign disease with a
very low potential for progression, whereas NASH is more
prone to progress to cirrhosis and result in complications.
For instance, the study by Teli et al. (102) states that no patient with simple liver steatosis developed more severe lesions during 11.5 years on average. These same results
were reported by Ratzius et al. (103). In contrast, NASH
progresses to more advanced stages in 43% of patients and
cirrhosis in 14%. Powell et al. (104) found that patients
progressing to cirrhosis were those with fibrosis in their
initial biopsy. In the study by Harrison et al. this progression was witnessed in one third of their patients (105). This
prognostic meaning has been reported by other authors. In
the study by Matteoni et al., after 10 years of follow-up liver cirrhosis was found in 4% when steatosis was the initial
lesion, and in 20% when NASH was the initial lesion
(106). To this date we have no reliable means to differentiate whether lesions restrict themselves to simple steatosis
or there is already NASH in a patient with NAFLD. In the
study by Saadeh et al. (97) none of the assessed imaging
tests could differentiate this, and no NASH-defining histologic changes were identified using these techniques. Angulo et al. (107) also found no factors allowing to differentiate NASH from simple steatosis. In the study by Dixon et
al. (108) more advanced NAFLD stages were found to be
associated with higher insulin resistance indices, high
blood pressure, and elevated ALT. More recently, Sumida
et al. (109) showed that serum thioredoxin, a marker for
oxidative stress, is significantly higher in patients with
NASH (60.3 ng/ml) versus those with simple steatosis
(24.6 ng/ml). However, the true diagnostic utility of this
test remains to be revealed. Thus, even though biopsy may
be in some cases unnecessary for the diagnosis of NASH,
it is needed to assess whether a liver lesion corresponds to
simple, unimportant steatosis or else consists of progressive NASH.
As with liver disease with other etiologies, prognosis is
also defined by stage, which un turn depends on liver fibrosis grade. Biopsy is a definitive tool in defining NASH
stage. Means to obtain this information without having recourse to biopsy have been explored. However, not many
are available, less so the useful ones. The study by Angulo
et al. (107) reports that age, diabetes mellitus, and
AST/ALT ratio predict severe fibrosis in patients with
NASH; however, they do not tell patients with severe fibrosis from those with mild fibrosis. Even though the
study by Sorbi et al. (98) reports that AST/ALT ratio increases with liver fibrosis extent in NASH, the study by
Mofrad et al. (110) shows that many patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis exhibit normal transaminases. More recently, Lédinghen et al. (111) showed that
advanced fibrosis grades were significantly associated
with transaminase rates above two times normal. Fibrosis
markers have also been used in NASH to assess disease
stage (112,113). According to data provided by Sakugawa
et al. (113), the combination of collagen-IV 7S domain
(> 5.0 ng/ml) and hyaluronic acid (> 50 ng/ml) detects advanced fibrosis with a sensitivity of 54.2%, a specificity of
92.2%, a PPV of 83.9%, and a NPV of 72.8%. The algorithm suggested by Rosenberg et al. (53), which includes
hyaluronic acid, PIIINP, TIMP-1, and age, allows to recognize these same stages in NASH with a sensitivity of 89%,
a specificity of 96%, a PPV of 80%, and a NPV of 98%. If
these results are confirmed, the need for liver biopsy in
these patients would be questioned.
Those who question the need for liver biopsy in these
patients, besides the already noted general reasons (pain,
risk, concern about sample representativity), base their
concerns in the scarce probabilities that biopsy results
will force a therapy change. In most patients with hypertransaminasemia and no cause to warrant it, a manageable disease is rarely found (114). This is particularly true
in NASH, as we lack therapies with proven efficacy for
this condition. In the near future we may possibly have
proven-efficacy therapies available; till then, we shall
keep on recommending these patients just what we advised before biopsy availability: “alcohol withdrawal,
weight loss, increased exercise, and avoidance of potentially hepatotoxic drugs” (98). The few therapeutic implications of biopsy results in NASH should be reported to
patients before they accept the procedure. 
To summarize the indication of liver biopsy in
NAFLD, we must point out that no consensus has thus far
been reached among those involved in this topic. It is
widely accepted that biopsy is the surest test for NAFLD
diagnosis, to differentiate simple fatty liver from NASH,
and to establish disease stage. Therefore, biopsy cannot
be disregarded in controlled studies where patient diagnosis must be assured. In clinical practice, biopsy indication will have to be individualized, and consider issues to
be solved (115). Ramesh and Sanyal have suggested that
biopsy should be performed in patients with abnormal
transaminase levels of unknown etiology and no metabolic syndrome. For patients with metabolic syndrome
biopsy will be necessary only if it may yield information
allowing therapy changes (116). If in the future we have
128 J. A. SOLÍS HERRUZO REV ESP ENFERM DIG (Madrid)
REV ESP ENFERM DIG 2006; 98(2): 122-139

effective, well tolerated therapies available that may be
administered to all patients with this disease, biopsy will
likely be unnecessary. If such therapies only benefit a
particular patient subgroup, biopsy will be necessary to
establish whether our patient belongs to the subgroup
where therapy is indicated.
In summary, if we wish to have enough information to
decide a treatment regimen as required by a particular patient, biopsy indication will have to be made on an individual basis, and be likely dispensed with on many occasions. If, on the contrary, we wish to assume no risks
regarding our decision, and want to be absolutely sure
about our diagnosis, know the presence of other factors
associated with the primary etiologic factor (virus, fat,
iron, etc.), or accurately establish liver lesion stage and
necroinflammatory activity extent, there will be no
choice but to obtain a liver biopsy sample with the appropriate length, thickness, and number of portal spaces.
Currently available non-invasive tests are not sensitive
enough to provide all these data.
