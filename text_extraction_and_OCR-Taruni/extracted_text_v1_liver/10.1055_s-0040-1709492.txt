The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is increasing worldwide, and is now the fifth most common tumor and
the third most common cause of cancer mortality.1 In the
United States, mortality for HCC has increased faster than for
any other tumor primarily due to cirrhosis from hepatitis C
virus as well as other etiologies such as alcohol, nonalcoholic
fatty liver disease, and hepatitis B virus.2,3 The increased
incidence of HCC combined with the demonstrated efficacy
of liver transplantation (LT) for HCC treatment and a favorable allocation policy have led to HCC being the most
common indication for LT in the United States.4
This dramatic rise in transplantation for HCC is particularly
remarkable considering that the early experience with LT for
HCC produced such uniformly dismal results that in 1989 the
Department of Health and Human Services listed HCC as a
contraindication for LT.5,6 The initial unfavorable outcomes of
LT in the setting of HCC led to the conclusion that LT was not
suitable as a treatment for HCC, though this was largely due to
the use of LT as a “last resort” only for those with very extensive
tumors. Patients undergoing LT for other indications who were
found to have incidental tumors demonstrated excellent survival rates, suggesting that patients with limited tumor burden
may benefit from LT. The landmark publication from Mazzaferro et al in 1996 demonstrated 83% recurrence-free survival
and 75% actuarial survival at 4 years for patients undergoing LT
for HCC within specific criteria, clearly defining the essential
role of patient selection.7
Due to these encouraging findings as well as validation
from other reports,7–9 LTwas once again approved in the U.S.
as a treatment option for patients with HCC, though access to
transplantation for patients with HCC was significantly
limited by the national organ allocation system, which prior
to 2002 was based on waiting time and medical status. Since
that time, the field of HCC has evolved to include the option of
living donor LT (LDLT) for adults beginning in 1998, the
adoption of the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD)-
based organ allocation system, as well as advancements in
liver-directed therapies used as a bridge to transplantation or
as primary therapy, and the approval of modestly effective
systemic therapies for advanced HCC.
Importantly, in the U.S. from 2000 to 2002, HCC was one of
the most common indications for LDLT as there was no other
viable option. However, while the use of LDLT for treatment
of patients with HCC has continued to flourish around the

Abstract Liver transplantation (LT) is an optimal treatment option for early-stage unresectable
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with cirrhosis as it provides a treatment for
underlying liver disease as well as a decreased incidence of recurrent cancer compared
with alternative treatment strategies. A primary barrier to LT for HCC is the critical
shortage of available liver allografts. The system of prioritization and access to
deceased donor transplantation for patient with HCC in the United States has
continued to evolve, while variable approaches including no additional priority, are
in use around the world. While the Milan criteria remain the most well-established
pretransplantation selection criteria, multiple other algorithms which expand beyond
Milan have been proposed. The current review focuses on liver allocation for HCC as
well as the principles and varied models available for pretransplant patient selection.

world, most notably in Asia, the combination of a widely
published donor death and the adoption of the MELD system
in 2002, which included an overprioritization for HCC
patients, led to a marked reduction in the use of LDLT for
HCC patients in the United States. Initial concern of an
increased risk of HCC recurrence in the setting of LDLT for
HCC have instead been determined to be related to patient
selection, and perhaps related to changes in organ allocation
policy as well as the ongoing critical organ shortage. LDLT is
once again rising in the U.S. both for patients with and
without HCC.
Evolution of Allocation Policy for Patients
with HCC
The MELD-based system for allocation of deceased donor
livers was adopted in the United States in 2002, and has been
associated with a decrease in waitlist mortality and an
increase in post-LT survival.10,11 This system was updated
to include sodium in 2016, which has led to a further
decrease in waitlist mortality without any impact on postLT survival12,13 Patients with HCC as well as other complications of cirrhosis and certain metabolic conditions have an
increased mortality risk (without access to timely LT) which
is not predicted by their calculated MELD or MELD-Na score.
Therefore, they are allowed to receive assigned MELD scores
(commonly referred to as MELD exception scores). Since
inception, the MELD system has continued to evolve through
multiple revisions as summarized in ►Fig. 1.
The process of awarding exception scores for HCC in the
United States is automated for patients whose tumors are
within designated criteria. Historically, assigned MELD score
exceptions started at a score intended to reflect a 15% risk of
waitlist drop out over a 3-month period, and this score increased every 3 months by a value anticipated to reflect a 10%
increased risk of mortality without transplantation. The initial
scores of 24 for T1 and 28 for T2 were reduced twice as they
awarded too much priority to HCC patients, relative to non-HCC
patients.14,15 Until very recently, patients who presented with
HCC beyond Milan criteria who were successfully downstaged
by liver-directed therapy had to undergo an appeals process to a
review board.
While this system of MELD score exceptions allowed access
to LT for patients with HCC, several important issues arose.
First, despite the two early downward adjustments of the initial
assigned score, except in parts of the United States with the
longest wait times, patients with HCC exception scores still had
a markedly higher transplant rate and a significantly lower
waitlist dropout rate than nonexception patients, leading to a
major disparity in access to transplant between patients in
the U.S. with and without HCC.16–18 Second, it was noted that
the median MELD score at the time of transplant continued to
rise yearly in nearly every area of the country, and this “MELD
inflation” was hypothesized to be related to the system of

impact. T1/T2: T1 a single tumor 1–2 cm, and T2 1–2 tumors between 1 and 3 cm or 1 tumor 2–5 cm. Share 35: a change which shared liver

exception scores which created large concentrations of relatively stable patients at specific score thresholds reflective of
the exception scores granted for patients every 3 months (22,
25, 28, 29, etc.).19 Finally, it was noted that the regional review
systemwas highlyinconsistentin the approach to patientswith
HCC outside of standard criteria, as well as for patients with
other non–policy-based MELD exception requests.20 These
issues were some of the most important challenges to the U.S.
system.
Balancing Access for HCC and Non-HCC Patients
The issue of unequal access to LT for HCC and non-HCC
patients is of particular importance given that this disparity
is primarily a result of organ allocation policy. This differs
from the critical shortage in available deceased donor organs
overall, which relates a shortage of donors relative to the
number of potential recipients. Allocation policy in the
United States begins with the organ-specific committees of
the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network
(OPTN), which are made up of volunteer representatives of
the transplant community from around the country, and
after an extensive process of statistical modeling, gathering
public feedback, and subsequent revision, the final policy is
ultimately determined by the governing board of the OPTN,
which is also made up of representatives of the transplant
community as well as the public.
The overprioritization for HCC patients was addressed by
the “cap and delay” policy revision, which after favorable
modeling, was adopted in 2015.21 This revision added a 6-
month waiting period before patients could be transplanted
based on their assigned HCC exception score, though the
score granted after 6 months was MELD 28 (the same as they
would have had after waiting 6 months under the prior
system). This avoided further disadvantaging patients waiting in high MELD regions, yet allowed for biologic selection
by essentially mimicking what was already happening in the
higher MELD areas where the transplant rates between HCC
and non-HCC patients were noted to be more similar. By
prolonging the waiting time, tumors with poor biology will
be identified and futile transplantation may be reduced, as
supported by an analysis of U.S. data by Halazun et al
demonstrating worse outcomes for HCC patients transplanted in U.S. regions with very short waiting times compared with regions with long wait times.22 A recent analysis
of transplant rates for HCC and non-HCC patients in the U.S.
in the 2 years just prior to and just after the policy change
determined that HCC candidates had a 37% lower risk of
waitlist mortality/dropout prepolicy and a comparable risk
of mortality/dropout postpolicy, and concluded that the
revised policy established equity between HCC and nonHCC waitlist candidates.23
Improved Standardization for HCC Exception Patients
Addressing the issues of MELD inflation and inconsistent
approaches by regional review boards for HCC and non-HCC
patients required a more significant change. First, a national
policy to address patients who initially presented with HCC
beyond the Milan criteria but who were successfully downsized to within Milan criteria was implemented in December
of 2017. This change adopted the downstaging criteria
initially proposed by University of California San Francisco
(UCSF) to define the allowable tumor burden prior to downstaging treatment (1 lesion between 5 and 8 cm, 2–3 lesions
with at least one greater than 3 cm though none greater than
5 cm and sum of all less than 8 cm, 4–5 lesions all less than
3 cm and sum less than 8 cm), as well as a cap on the
maximum α-fetoprotein (AFP) at 1,000 ng/mL, creating a
consistent national downstaging policy for these patients.
Both changes were adopted to factor biologic behavior in the
prediction of both waitlist and post-LT outcomes.
Second, in May of 2019, a National Liver Review Board
(NLRB) was adopted, changing the regional review board
system of exception review to a national review system. The
main goal was to improve consistency around the U.S.,
making things more equitable for patients and addressing
concerns that some areas had more liberal acceptance of
non–policy-based exception requests. A secondary purpose
was to improve efficiency. The newly adopted NLRB has three
distinct boards, including one specifically to handle HCC
exception requests which do not meet policy criteria. Guidance documents addressing the most common non–policybased exception requests were created for all three boards to
provide criteria to guide the board and centers when considering or preparing non–policy-based exception requests.
To address the conundrum of how to set a national score in
the setting of marked regional differences in the score
required to access transplant across the U.S., as well as
concern over the previously described “MELD inflation,” a
fixed score set 3 points below the median score required to
access transplantation in the area of distribution where the
candidate is listed (MMaT-3) was adopted with the adoption
of the NLRB. The new exception score does not increase every
3 months, but remains a fixed score, so that allocation for
exception patients relies on time waiting with approved
exception. This is in contrast to the prior elevator system
which also relied heavily on time waiting, but allowed
patients with exceptions to be transplanted at a significantly
higher rate than non-exception patients as previously noted.
The median MELD is recalculated every 6 months using the
previous 12 months of data and scores are subsequently
adjusted. The primary goal of the use of MMaT is to assign a
score that is adjusted based on the score required to access
transplant in the area where the patient is waiting, given
there are differences around the U.S. in the median score
required to access to transplant, while secondary goals are to
continue to address overprioritization of HCC patients
(though this may have been largely addressed by the cap
and delay policy adopted in 2015) and to ameliorate MELD
inflation. While data on how this system may perform is not
yet available, based on modeling, it is anticipated that this
may lead to at least stabilization of the median MELD score
and potentially a decrease, as well as standardize the approach to exception patients. Importantly, similar to prior
policy changes, it is possible that further adjustments to the
assigned score of MMaT -3 (either lower or higher) may be
needed to achieve better parity with nonexception patients.

The current system for HCC patient selection and organ
allocation is summarized in ►Table 1.
In addition to the major changes impacting patient selection and organ allocation policy for HCC highlighted earlier,
more modest but still important policy changes have also
occurred as noted in ►Fig. 1. The adoption of a standardized
pathology form provided required elements including the
size, location, number, and grade of HCC lesions found in the
explant which are reported using a standardized format,
which allows for improved documentation and interpretation as well as data which can be used to guide future policy
revision. Adoption of standardized imaging criteria to ensure
centers were following a minimum acceptable standard for
the noninvasive diagnosis of HCC was also necessary to
ensure that patients had findings that would justify additional waitlist prioritization.
Other options for addressing access to transplantation for
patients with HCC have been adopted around the world. For
example, in the U.K., a benefit model was adopted in 2018
which gives priority to urgent cases as well as to those with
the highest anticipated benefit from transplant based on a
formula combining multiple donor and recipient parameters, including the recipient diagnosis of HCC.24 The Transplant Benefit concept ranks candidates by combining the
principles of both urgency and utility. Importantly, the
period of time over which benefit is measured will impact
the allocation, as a longer time will favor younger candidates
and a shorter time will favor older candidates, provided they
have a higher waitlist mortality. There are also considerable
challenges to the identification of pretransplant factors
beyond age which may reliably predict long-term posttransplant outcome, and thus, the model adopted by the U.K. will
surely provide valuable guidance and insight into the feasibility of a more widespread adoption of a benefit-based
system.25 Euro-transplant utilizes a MELD-based system
with additional exception points awarded for HCC and
increased every 90 days; Italy uses a MELD-based system
with additional HCC points at the time of listing, while
France uses a system which incorporates AFP and requires
HCC treatment.26,27 While a thorough discussion of the
evolution of HCC allocation around the world is beyond
the scope of the review, it is essential to know that there
are multiple approaches utilized by countries around the
world with varied degrees of overlap, each typically relying
on the assessment of tumor biology by the use of tumor size,
number of nodules, biomarkers, or/and response to therapy
with perhaps the one common theme being all systems
require ongoing monitoring and revision.
Selection Criteria for Liver Transplantation
for HCC
Just as the system for allocation of livers for patients with
HCC has evolved, so too has the criteria by which patients
with HCC are selected, and the most common selection
criteria are summarized in ►Table 2. As described above,
in the U.S. those presenting within the Milan criteria as well
as those who are initially outside of Milan but who undergo
successful downstaging to within Milan are eligible for an
assigned MELD exception score and access to deceased donor
transplantation. This modest expansion beyond the Milan
criteria was based on the observation that excellent outcomes can be achieved with LT for HCC both for those within
Milan and for a subset of patients beyond Milan criteria. One
of the earliest to be developed is the UCSF criteria, in which
patients with a single lesion up to 6.5 cm, or up to 3 lesions
none greater than 4.5 and a total tumor burden < 8 cm were
demonstrated to have outcomes equivalent to those within
the Milan criteria, with approximately 80% survival at 5 years,
though another reports from centers outside of UCSF have
not had as favorable results.28,29
In addition to the Milan and UCSF criteria, several other
systems have been proposed for pretransplant selection for
patients with HCC (see ►Table 2). The overall principal
underlying the drive for expanded criteria is well-captured
by the “Metroticket” concept, again by the group in Milan,
which recognizes that transplanting patients with more advanced tumors does impact posttransplant outcome, in a
stepwise and potentially predictable way such that “price”
that is paid in terms of HCC recurrence and inferior outcomes
or reduced access to transplantation for other non-HCC
patients is proportionate to how far beyond standard HCC
selection criteria the system is willing to go (the up-to-seven
criteria—the sum of thelargest tumor in cm plus the number of
tumors is  7).30 The recently published Metroticket 2.0 uses a
model based on level of AFP, tumor size, and tumor number
Table 1 U.S. selection and allocation for HCC in 2020
Selection for automatic exception score:
• AFP < 1,000 ng/mL. If AFP 1,000 ng/mL, it must fall
below 500 ng/mL after treatment and
remain < 500 ng/mL
AND
• Patients within Milan criteria: 1–2 tumors between 1 and
3 cm, or 1 tumor between 2 and 5 cm
OR
• Downstaged to Milan criteria by liver-directed therapy
from initial downstaging criteria: 1 tumor between 5 and
8 cm, 2–3 none greater than 5 cm and sum < 8 cm, 4–5
lesions all less than 3 cm and sum < 8 cm
Awarded MELD exception score:
• MMaT-3. After 6-month wait, patients are awarded a fixed
score of 3 points lower than Median MELD at Transplantation (MMaT-3) for patients transplanted within the area
of distribution where the candidate is listed (distribution is
a concentric circle model as of February 4, 2020.) MMaT is
recalculated every 6 months based on the previous 1 year of
data
Appeal to National Liver Review Board:
• Pathway for patients outside of above criteria or who may
require a higher priority score. Center must provide adequate medical justification for prioritization over other
waiting candidates

which was intended to achieve at least 70% tumor-specific
5-year survival. For patients with an AFP < 200 ng/mL, the sum
of the number of tumors and size in cm should be less than 7,
while for AFP 200 to 400 ng/mL, the sum of tumor number plus
size should be  5, and if thelevel of AFP is 400 to 1,000 ng/mL,
the sum of the number and size of tumors should be  4. This
model was developed with multi-institution data from Italy
and validated in a population from China.31
Other proposed systems also use a biologiccomponent to the
score, and generally, the size of the largest lesion is the component with the strongest prognostic role. Toso et al proposed a
system using a population of HCC patients from Canada and
Switzerland based on total tumor volume < 115 cm3 and
AFP < 400 ng/mL, while French have proposed and validated
in Italy a system including AFP, as well as number and size of
nodules, with each variable being assigned a specific number of
points between 0 and 4, and those with 2 or less points being
considered low-risk.32,33 The primary difference of these two
models compared with either the Milan criteria or the UCSF
criteria is the use of AFP, which was independently predictive of
worse outcomes even for patients within Milan criteria. A
continuous risk score, Hazard Associated with Liver Transplantation for HCC has also been developed and validated in an
international cohort, and includes AFP and tumor burden, plus
MELD-Na, and they have recently published a larger application.34TheKyoto criteriainclude a restriction on totalnumber of
tumors ( 10) as well as size of the largest tumor ( 5 cm) and
des-gamma-carboxy-prothrombin < 400 mAU/mL, and for
those within these criteria, a remarkably low recurrence rate
of just 4% at 5 years is reported though the number meeting
these criteria in this study was just 147 out of a total of 198.35
Recently, investigators have also proposed the use of machine
learning decision tree techniques to optimize selection criteria
both for HCC and non-HCC patients based on a large number of
variables for waitlisted and transplanted patients already collectedin OPTN data from 2002 to 2016 to developmore accurate
prediction of 3-month risk of waitlist dropout due to death or
becoming unsuitable for transplantation. Perhaps not surprisingly, the same variables of tumor number, size, and AFP are also
part of this system.36
Conclusion and Future Directions
While the advantages of LT for HCC include excellentlong-term
disease-free survival as well as treatment of underlying cirrhosis, a primary disadvantage especially for patients who do
not have a potential living donor option, is the critical shortage
of available deceased organs, leading for the need for an
allocation system as well as the need to carefully select which
HCC patients are most likely to benefit from transplantation.
Regardless of whether the system is a MELD-based system
with exceptions for patients with HCC within specific criteria
as in the U.S., or a different system, there will be need to
balance the risk of disease progression and potential for
waitlist drop out for both HCC and non-HCC patients. The
most essential step for the future following any organ allocation or distribution policy change is an objective, efficient, and
collaborative effort by the transplant community to optimize

the new system. The most recent changes in the U.S. have been
significant both for HCC and non-HCC patients andwill require
additional and likely ongoing revision such as adjusting the
size of the distribution circles according to population density,
or determining whether MMaT-3 is the optimal prioritization
for HCC, or if it should be raised or lowered. It would be ideal if
updated analysis tools could be developed, potentially using
artificial intelligence or machine learning to facilitate such
efforts. If instead of optimizing the newly developed system,
the community is instead directed to embark on the development of an entirely new system, such as the borderless
allocation model, in addition to the risk of further discord
within the transplant community, there is also a risk that
patients will be subjected to a nonoptimized allocation system
for a prolonged period while a new system is developed.
