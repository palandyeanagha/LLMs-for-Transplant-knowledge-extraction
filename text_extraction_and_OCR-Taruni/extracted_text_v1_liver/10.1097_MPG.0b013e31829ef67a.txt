This review was developed by the Mitochondrial Liver Diseases Working Group of the 
Childhood Liver Disease Research and Education Network (ChiLDREN), supported by the 
National Institute of Digestive, Diabetes and Kidney Diseases, NIH, to guide evaluation of 
children with suspected mitochondrial liver disease. Data informing the evaluation guideline 
was supported by Medline searches of published English language literature and expert 
opinion from a committee of pediatric hepatologists and a mitochondrial metabolism 
specialist.

Mitochondrial respiratory chain defects can affect any tissue, with the most energydependent organs being most vulnerable.(1) In general, clinical manifestations include 
multisystem involvement such as brain, muscle, heart, or kidney, with acute or chronic liver 
dysfunction, sometimes in the presence of lactic acidosis, a biomarker of limited sensitivity.
(2, 3) Heterogeneous clinical presentations can be explained by the fact that the 
mitochondrial quantity and function are uniquely influenced by both nuclear and 
mitochondria DNA (mtDNA) or by the fact that cells in various tissues can contain different 
mixtures of normal and abnormal mitochondrial genomes (heteroplasmy). Most 
mitochondrial proteins and enzymes are coded by nuclear genes with Mendelian inheritance, 
while some respiratory chain subunits, ribosomal and transfer RNAs are encoded by 
mitochondrial genes that are maternally inherited.(4) Mutations, deletions, or duplications in 
either of these classes can cause disease, and mutations in nuclear genes that control 
mitochondrial DNA replication, transcription, and translation may lead to mtDNA depletion 
syndrome or to a translational disorder.(5-7)
The respiratory chain, consisting of 5 multimeric complexes (I-V) in the mitochondrial inner 
membrane, generates energy as ATP via electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation 
(Figure 1). Defects in the respiratory chain enzymes or mitochondrial membrane transport 
proteins result in injury to energy-dependent organs, especially brain, retina, muscle, heart, 
and liver.(8) In addition, hepatic mitochondria oxidize fatty acids forming ketone bodies, an 
important source of energy for the brain in the fasting state. Fatty acid oxidation defects, an 
important group of primary bioenergetic defects, can present similarly with hepatopathy or 
encephalopathy, often with nonketotic hypoglycemia, acidosis and hyperammonemia, and 
are thus included in the differential diagnosis and should be simultaneously evaluated.(9)
Establishing the diagnosis of primary mitochondrial bioenergetic defects in patients with 
liver disease requires a high index of suspicion in specific clinical scenarios. A tiered 
diagnostic evaluation is useful (Table 1). Although mitochondrial hepatopathies are a 
heterogeneous group of disorders, there are several general laboratory investigations in 
blood and urine which can reveal an altered redox status suggestive of respiratory-chain 
defects (lactate:pyruvate molar ratios and ketone body ratios). Specific laboratory tests are 
considered in those with unique clinical presentations as well, and either tissue analysis or 
genotyping is used to identify the etiology. Other typically involved organ systems should 
be evaluated when mitochondrial hepatopathy is suspected (Table 2). Several important 
management issues should be addressed during this evaluation process. These guidelines 
outline the evaluation of the infant or child with suspected mitochondrial hepatopathy. Two 
summary tables (Table 3 and 4) describing each genetic etiology follow; reference clinical 
laboratories for the genetic tests can be found on www.genetests.org
I. Clinical Scenarios Suggesting Possible Mitochondrial Liver Disease
Mitochondrial liver disease can present acutely in a child with no history of hepatic 
dysfunction, or with chronic liver and CNS disease. Fulminant or acute liver failure is one 
important presentation of mitochondrial disease.(10) Especially in a young child or in one 
with pre-existing or disproportionate central nervous system (CNS) involvement, 
mitochondrial disease is in the differential diagnosis of acute liver failure. Importantly, if

liver transplant is being considered, careful attention must be paid to potential extrahepatic 
manifestations of mitochondrial dysfunction. Another clinical presentation is chronic liver 
disease, manifested by elevated aminotransferases, hepatomegaly, cholestasis, cirrhosis and 
especially steatohepatitis; these may be accompanied by other indicators of mitochondrial 
disease including hypoglycemia or lactic acidosis. Thirdly, liver disease accompanied by 
chronic neuromuscular disease or disease in other organ systems may be a sign of 
mitochondrial disease.
II. Tiered Diagnostic Evaluation
A wide array of tests which are useful in establishing the diagnosis of mitochondrial 
hepatopathies is available. These tests range from simple, inexpensive, easily available 
screening tests to very expensive widely ranging genetic studies. In the child who is 
suspected of having a mitochondrial disease, a tiered approach to diagnostic testing is 
recommended. Early screening tests (Tier 1) might provide clues to abnormalities in energy 
metabolism and results of these tests might guide subsequent confirmatory testing to 
establish a molecular diagnosis. Genotyping is available clinically for the more common 
mitochondrial diseases (Tier 2); the clinical scenario or results of screening tests can inform 
the choice of genetic tests. For example, a panel screening for specific gene mutations in 
DGUOK, POLG1, and MPV17 responsible for infantile liver failure with lactic acidosis and 
mitochondrial DNA depletion is readily available and might be useful early in evaluation 
(see Table 3). The diagnostic role of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), which is now 
allowing sequencing of more than 100 genes involved in mitochondrial diseases with a 
single blood test and at relatively low cost, (11) or even whole exome or genome 
sequencing, will become increasingly important and will eventually replace genotyping 
single genes or small panels of genes in Tier 2; however, the identification of multiple gene 
variants of uncertain significance will require detailed clinical and biochemical confirmation 
for interpretation. Tissue may also be needed to make a specific biochemical diagnosis, 
particularly if the liver is the major or sole affected organ (tier 3; Figure 2). Occasionally, 
diagnostic findings will only be revealed in liver tissue rather than in blood, muscle, or skin 
fibroblasts. When further clarification is needed, genotyping for less common diseasecausing genes may be required (Tier 4); however, the use of NGS earlier on in the 
evaluation process in the future (in Tier 2) may obviate the need for this step in the 
evaluation paradigm. At present, the diagnostic yield of NGS of all mitochondrial genes is 
high in patients with well characterized mitochondrial disease, in particular with 
biochemical evidence of mitochondrial enzymatic dysfunction (11), but is low in patients 
with only a clinical suspicion.(12) Biochemical studies evaluating the structure and function 
of mitochondrial subunits in the affected tissue can be performed as needed, specifically to 
determine if new genetic variants have a functional effect (Figure 3). Thus, a combination of 
biochemical and molecular studies may be needed to confirm the pathologic nature of new 
gene variants to be described in the future. Table 1 below outlines a tiered approach to 
diagnostic evaluation.
The following Tables 3 and 4 catalog known mitochondrial hepatopathies and briefly 
describe the mutation, defect, clinical description, and diagnostic testing. The typical hepatic 
presentation, ranging from hepatic failure to cholestasis to steatohepatitis to cirrhosis is

briefly outlined; neurologic symptoms and other systems involved are briefly reviewed and 
references are provided. The disorders are separated into those with a neonatal or infantile 
presentation (Table 3) and those with later or more chronic onset (Table 4). There is, 
however, overlap between these two, and new diseases and presentations are recognized 
frequently.
III. Evaluation for Disease in Other Organ Systems
As part of the evaluation for mitochondrial hepatopathies, a systematic approach also needs 
to be instituted to search for involvement of other affected organ systems (Table 2). This 
takes on particular significance when liver failure occurs in a child with suspected 
mitochondrial disease, as the decision to consider liver transplantation is especially 
challenging. Because mitochondrial disease usually involves multiple organ systems and is 
generally progressive in other organs even following liver transplantation, there are many 
uncertainties regarding liver transplantation. Possible post-transplant appearance of new 
progressive symptoms in organs uninvolved prior to liver transplantation also needs to be 
considered.(43-46). Establishing criteria for liver transplantation in mitochondrial 
hepatopathies is beyond the scope of this report. However, in the evaluation for 
transplantation, meticulous evaluation for disease in other organ systems is paramount, 
especially since results of testing for specific disorders can be delayed by weeks. Evaluation 
of the central nervous system is critical. Besides a careful neurologic examination, MRI of 
the brain is done to evaluate for Leigh disease, cerebellar atrophy, leukodystrophy, and 
cerebral atrophy. MR spectroscopy can be especially helpful, but blood lactate >3 mmol/L 
may affect interpretation. Evaluation can also include EEG and CSF examination (see 
above). To evaluate for cardiomyopathy, EKG and echocardiogram should be done. A 
detailed ophthalmologic exam may reveal ophthalmoplegia in DGUOK deficiency, 
retinopathy in LCHAD or respiratory chain defects, corneal abrasions in MPV17, or optic 
atrophy in POLG disease. Serum electrolytes, serum and urine phosphorus and creatinine, 
urine amino acids, urinalysis, and urine protein are measured to evaluate renal function since 
abnormal tubular function may suggest a defect in BCS1L. Because diabetes and even 
adrenal insufficiency can be seen in mitochondrial disorders, HbA1c and morning cortisol 
level should be considered. Pancreatic insufficiency is seen in some mitochondrial diseases 
and may be detected by measuring fecal pancreatic elastase. Hearing screening should be 
performed.
IV. Management during Evaluation for Possible Mitochondrial Disease
The child with mitochondrial disease can be vulnerable to metabolic perturbations such as 
hypoglycemia or acidosis; close monitoring is important. It is important to discontinue or 
avoid medications that may exacerbate hepatopathy or impair mitochondrial function or 
mtDNA translation or transcription, including sodium valproate, tetracycline and macrolide 
antibiotics, reverse transcriptase inhibitors (particularly AZT), chloramphenicol, quinolones, 
and linezolid.(47) Use of Ringer’s lactate intravenous solution should be avoided because 
the liver may not be able to metabolize lactate; propofol should be avoided during anesthesia 
or sedated procedures since the drug can interfere with mitochondrial function.(48) The goal 
is to maintain anabolism using a balanced intake of fat and carbohydrates with at least 75% 
Molleston et al. Page 4

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript

of normal caloric intake while avoiding unbalanced intakes (e.g., glucose only at high 
intravenous rate) or fasting for >12 hours.(49) In patients with preexisting lactic acidosis, 
lactate levels should be monitored around procedures to avoid excessive lactic acidosis.
Conclusion
Mitochondrial disease can present from infancy to adulthood with varying degrees of 
hepatic and extrahepatic involvement. In the last decade, there has been a rapid expansion of 
newly recognized mitochondrial diseases and their molecular bases. Available technology to 
aid in diagnosis has improved substantially. Nonetheless, diagnosis of suspected 
mitochondrial disease in children is complicated; a systematic clinical, biochemical, and 
molecular approach can aid in making a timely, accurate, and cost-effective diagnosis.

Urine acylglycines and 2-ethylmalonic quantification (if multiple acyl-CoA
dehydrogenase deficiency is suspected).
Thymidine (plasma) (especially in cases with coexistent intestinal dysmotility
concerning for MNGIE syndrome).
Coenzyme-Q levels in leukocytes, not serum (for CoQ deficiency; leukocyte levels
correlate better with tissue coenzyme Q levels, whereas serum levels reflect
nutritional status).
Quantitative serum methylmalonic acid (elevated in SUCLA and SUCLG1
deficiencies).
CSF analysis: Lactate and pyruvate (if blood lactate is normal but evidence of
CNS involvement), amino acids (especially elevated CSF alanine), and protein
concentration (note CSF protein can be elevated in POLG1 disease early on, even
when lactate is normal).
Tier 2 Genotyping for More Common Genes
Most common with liver involvement: POLG1 (15, 16), DGUOK (17-19), MPV17
(20, 21) , SUCLG1 (22), C10ORF2/Twinkle (23), TRMU (see Tables 3 and 4).
If neuromuscular features suggest MELAS (Mitochondrial Myopathy
Encephalopathy, Lactic Acidosis and Stroke-like Episodes) or pancreatic
insufficiency suggests Pearson’s marrow/pancreas syndrome: mitochondrial DNA
point mutations/deletions.(24)
If methylmalonic acid is elevated: SUCLG1.(22)
If acylcarnitines and/or urine organic acids suggest specific fatty acid oxidation
(FAO) defects: Genotyping for Long Chain 3-Hydroxyacyl-CoA Dehydrogenase
Deficiency (LCHAD) (25), Carnitine Palmitoyl Transferase Deficiency (CPTI & II
deficiency) (26, 27), or Multiple Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency (MADD =
Glutaric acidemia II = ETF & ETF-DH deficiency) (28), SLC25A20 for carnitine–
acylcarnitine translocase (CACT deficiency).(29)
For recurrent acute liver failure: TRMU, ACAD9, CPTI, SUCLGI.(22, 26, 30, 31)
Identification of TRMU mutations is urgent in infants with acute liver failure since
these patients frequently recover without the need for transplantation.(31, 32)
Note: Next Generation Sequencing (e.g., exome sequencing) will allow for
simultaneous evaluation of panels of all nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial
proteins and all mitochondrial DNA genes at considerably lower cost in the future,
encompassing the above gene tests, and will eventually replace single gene
sequencing. It is already available in some countries.
Tier 3 Tissue Evaluation
Liver biopsy:
1. Light microscopy, electron microscopy (place specimen in glutaraldehyde);
 consider oil red O stain for fat on frozen section; consider iron stain if DGUOK

 or BCS1L are suspected (Figure 2).
2. Frozen tissue for respiratory chain enzyme activity analysis.
3. Frozen tissue for DNA quantification (mitochondrial DNA depletion analysis).
4. Consider storing frozen tissue for future studies if amount adequate. Consider
 blue native PAGE gel analysis with in-gel activity staining (Figure 3).
Skin biopsy for fibroblast culture. Can be used for fatty acid oxidation enzyme
activity, respiratory chain enzyme activities, blue native PAGE (BNP) testing.(33)
FAO probe studies (especially if carnitine profile is abnormal), or high resolution
respirometry.(34) Note: Because of heteroplasmy of mitochondrial genes or due to differential tissue expression of nuclear genes, 
abnormalities in patients with mitochondrial hepatopathy can sometimes only be confirmed in liver tissue.
Muscle biopsy, especially if muscle involvement is present: light and electron
microscopy. Consider histochemistry for respiratory chain complexes, respiratory
chain enzyme assays, blue native PAGE (BNP) analysis, mtDNA depletion
analysis, mtDNA whole genome sequencing and/or deletion analysis.
Tier 4 Further Molecular and Biochemical Evaluation
Additional genes to consider: TRMU (31) BCS1L (35), SCO1 (36), TSFM (37),
TWINKLE (5, 23), ACAD9 (30) (the latter especially if episodes of liver failure and
fatty acid oxidation defect) (see Tables 3 and 4). Not all of these tests may be
clinically available. A microarray is available to evaluate for large deletions or
duplications in nuclear or mitochondrial genes.(38) Note: Next Generation
Sequencing (e.g., exome sequencing) will allow for simultaneous evaluation of
panels of all nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins and many or all
mitochondrial DNA genes at considerably lower cost in the future, and will
eventually replace single gene sequencing. At present, its efficacy is highest in
clinically and biochemically well characterized patients.
Targeted molecular analyses based on the results of tissue-based respiratory chain
enzyme assays and primary liver disease as presentation:
1. Isolated complex I deficiency: ACAD9 (30)
2. Isolated complex III deficiency: BCS1L (35)
3. Isolated complex IV deficiency: SCO1 (36)
4. Combined complex I, III, and IV deficiency with incompletely assembled
complex V bands on blue native PAGE: (This signifies a generic defect in the
 processing of mtDNA encoded subunits.(39) It can be caused by a deficiency
 of mtDNA (mtDNA depletion syndromes) or by a defect in transcription or
 translation.
A) If mtDNA content is <5% of normal in liver: mtDNA depletion syndrome:
POLG1, POLG2, TWINKLE, DGUOK, and TYMP.(40)
B) With normal or mildly decreased mtDNA but with multiple deletions (assay
with long range PCR or with NextGen mtDNA analysis): Same as above,
but more often with POLG or TWINKLE or TYMP.
C) With normal or (more common) elevated mtDNA: translation defects such
as EF-Tu, EGF-1, TSFM, TRMU, FARS2 (and other tRNA synthase genes,
tRNA modification genes, ribosomal genes, translation initiation,
elongation and termination factors).(31, 37, 41) Consider exome or mito
exome sequencing for the many genes associated with the translational
machinery.
D) Deficiency of combined complex II-III assay but normal isolated assay II
and normal III indicates a likely coenzyme Q deficiency. Obtain coenzyme
Q levels, and review for causes of coenzyme Q deficiency.(42)
