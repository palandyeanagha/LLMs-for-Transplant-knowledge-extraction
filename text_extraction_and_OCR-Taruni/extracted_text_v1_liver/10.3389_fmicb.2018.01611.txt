Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection imposes a severe burden on global public
health. Currently, there are no curative therapies for millions of chronic HBV-infected
patients (Lok et al., 2017). Interferon (IFN; including pegylated IFN) is an approved antiHBV drug that not only exerts direct antiviral activity, but also augments immunity against
HBV infection. Through a systematic review of the literature, here we summarize and
present recent progress in research regarding the interactions between IFN and HBV as
well as dissect the antiviral mechanisms of IFN. We focus on inhibition of HBV replication
by IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) as well as inhibition of IFN signaling by HBV and viral
proteins. Finally, we briefly discuss current IFN-based HBV treatment strategies. This
review may help to better understand the mechanisms involved in the therapeutic action
of IFN as well as the crosstalk between IFN and HBV, and facilitate the development of
both direct-acting and immunology-based new HBV drugs.

INTRODUCTION
More than 50 years have passed since the identification of human hepatitis B virions, initially
named “Dane particles,” in the late 1960s; and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a serious
global health problem (Hirschman et al., 1969; Cossart and Field, 1970; Dane et al., 1970; ZanenLim, 1976; Glebe, 2007). Three-quarters of the world’s population live in HBV endemic regions, and
one-third of them have been exposed to HBV. Despite the implementation of HBV vaccination for
nearly 30 years, 240 million of 2 billion HBV-infected people worldwide have become chronically
infected. Approximately 39 million chronic HBV infections occur in the region of Southeast
Asia (Childs et al., 2018), and there are an estimated 100 million HBV surface antigen (HBsAg)-
positive people in both China and Africa who are at high risk for developing liver cirrhosis and
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (El-Serag and Rudolph, 2007; Levrero and Zucman-Rossi, 2016).
The World Health Organization estimates that there were 1.34 million HBV infection-related
deaths in 2015, which is comparable to the annual deaths caused by tuberculosis and is higher
than HIV-related mortality (Breakwell et al., 2017).
Interferons (IFNs) are a group of signaling proteins made and released by host cells in response
to various pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites (De Andrea et al., 2002; Lee and
Baldridge, 2017). Based on the receptor type to which they bind, human IFNs are classified into type
I, II, and III (Isaacs and Lindenmann, 1957; Wheelock, 1965; Sheppard et al., 2003; Vilcek, 2006;
Table 1). IFN-α and pegylated IFN-α have been approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B
(De Andrea et al., 2002; Liang et al., 2015). In addition, IFN-α has been reported to inhibit HBV

replication in in vitro systems (Wieland et al., 2003; Pollicino
et al., 2013; Lin and Young, 2014). HBV infection can activate
the innate immune response in the liver and trigger the local
production of type I or type III IFN (Wieland et al., 2004;
Shlomai et al., 2014b; Sato et al., 2015). However, it also has
been reported that the host’s response to HBV infection does not
induce production of either type I or III IFN (Cheng et al., 2017).
Many IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) have been shown to inhibit
HBV infection and replication through different pathways, and
many studies have tried to understand why IFN signaling is weak
in an HBV-infected liver. In this review, we discuss the crosstalk
between IFN and HBV based on the results generated in our
lab and those published by others, which may shed new light
on the interaction between IFN and HBV as well as provide
insight into new HBV drug discovery and development. This
review consists of three sections: (1) the HBV life cycle and the
classical IFN induction pathway in response to viral infection;
(2) a systematic discussion of the crosstalk between IFN and
HBV, with a focus on two-way inhibition: the inhibition of HBV
infection and replication by ISGs as well as the inhibition of IFN
signaling by HBV and HBV proteins; and (3) a brief discussion of
the current IFN-based HBV treatment strategies.
HBV GENOME ORGANIZATION AND
LIFE CYCLE
Hepatitis B virus belongs to the Hepadnaviridae family and
contains a 3.2-kb partially double-stranded DNA (Evans and
Seeger, 2007). Once entered into blood circulation, HBV binds
to its receptor, currently known as sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP), a multiple transmembrane
transporter predominantly expressed in hepatic cells (Yan et al.,
2012), resulting in viral entry. In the cytoplasm, the virus is caught
by the endosomes. In response to endosome maturation, the viral
envelope fuses with the endosome membrane and releases the
free nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm (Hayes et al., 2016). The
nucleocapsid is translocated to the nucleus where relaxed circular
DNA is released. And under the help of cellular replicative
machinery (Levrero et al., 2009; Koniger et al., 2014), the relaxed
circular DNA is converted into a covalently closed circular DNA
(cccDNA), which further interacts with histone proteins to form a
minichromosome. HBV synthesizes the capsid in the cytoplasm.
It appears that cccDNA in infected cells is difficult to eliminate
(Tong and Revill, 2016).
The HBV genome contains four overlapping open reading
frames (S, C, P, and X) (Figure 1). HBV cccDNA functions
as a transcription template, encoding four major viral RNA
species: pregenomic RNA (pgRNA, 3.5 kb), preS1 HBs RNA
(2.4 kb), preS2/S HBs RNA (2.1 kb), and HBV X protein RNA
(HBx, 0.7 kb) (Figure 1; Tuttleman et al., 1986; Newbold et al.,
1995). The viral RNA transcription is initiated by activating four
promoters (the core, pre-S1, pre-S2/S, and X promoters) with
host-specific transcriptional factors such as hepatocyte nuclear
factors (NFs) and epigenetic modifications (Pollicino et al.,
2006; Kim et al., 2016). The HBV genome also contains two
enhancer sites (En I and En II) for upregulation of transcription
(Hu and Siddiqui, 1991). Viral mRNAs are then transferred to
the cytoplasm where they function as templates either for the
synthesis of viral proteins or for the synthesis of minus-strand
DNA (reverse transcription) (Shlomai et al., 2014a). The HBV
mRNAs encode seven proteins depending on the locations of the
initiation codon in the RNA transcripts: preC mRNA for HBV e
antigen (HBeAg) (3.5 kb), pgRNA for HBV c antigen (HBcAg)
and Pol (3.5 kb), preS1 for large S (2.4 kb), preS2/S mRNAs for
middle and small surface proteins (MS and HBsAg, 2.1 kb), and
HBx mRNA for HBxAg (0.7 kb) (Figure 1; Liang, 2009). Once
viral protein synthesis reaches a certain level in the cytoplasm,
pgRNA is selectively packaged into the “HBcAg house” along
with Pol protein, which form the immature nucleocapsid, and
then pgRNA is reversely transcribed to the minus-strand DNA
catalyzed by the reverse transcriptase domain of Pol. A variable
length of plus-strand HBV DNA is synthesized using the minus
strand as the template to generate the HBV genome. The mature

HBV capsid is either enveloped with HBsAg and released from
hepatocytes or recycled to the nucleus for amplification of the
cccDNA pool (Figure 2; Rehermann and Nascimbeni, 2005).
CLASSICAL IFN AND ISG INDUCTION
PATHWAYS IN RESPONSE TO VIRAL
INFECTION
In response to viral infection, IFN production can be efficiently
induced in many types of cells by the activation of patternrecognition receptors. Activation of type I IFN family genes
constitutes one of the earliest transcriptional responses, perhaps
representing the most important innate immune response to
viral infection. Most nucleated vertebrate cells are able to both
produce and respond to type I IFN. The detection of intracellular
microbial DNA and RNA in macrophages and/or infected cells
is critical to elicit an appropriate innate immune response.
During viral infection, virus-derived nucleic acids (both RNA and
DNA) are mainly sensed by certain cytosolic pattern-recognition
receptors. For instance, viral RNA is recognized by retinoic
acid inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors, including RIGI (Pichlmair et al., 2006; Myong et al., 2009) and melanoma
differentiation associated protein 5 (Takeuchi and Akira, 2008,
2009), leading to its association with the mitochondrial antiviralsignaling protein (MAVS). DNA is sensed by DEAD-box protein
(DDX) 41, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), and γ-IFNinducible protein 16 (IFI16) (Unterholzner et al., 2010; Zhang
et al., 2011; Sun et al., 2013; Bhat and Fitzgerald, 2014), all of
which lead to the activation of stimulator of IFN genes (STING).
Both MAVS recruitment and STING activation after RNA or
DNA viral infection lead to TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1)
phosphorylation and activation of IFN regulatory factors (IRFs),
which are primarily responsible for IFN production (Sato et al.,
2000). Cytosolic RNA polymerase III is specialized to detect
foreign and aberrant DNA, which is converted into RNA. RNA
synthesized in the cytosol contains 50
-triphosphate, which can be
detected by RIG-I. Therefore, RNA polymerase III can act as a
DNA sensor that triggers the innate immune response through
the RIG-I pathway (Chiu et al., 2009; Figure 3).
The antiviral function of type I IFN is cascaded via binding
to type I IFN receptor (IFNAR1), activating the Janus tyrosine

(STAT) pathway, and subsequently inducing approximately 300
ISGs (Ivashkiv and Donlin, 2014). Different ISGs can inhibit
different stages of the viral life cycle (Liu et al., 2013; Chen et al.,
2014). The HBV replication steps that can be inhibited by ISGs
are illutrstated in Figure 3.
HOW HBV INTERACTS WITH IFN
INDUCTION AND SIGNALING
As reported previously, the lack of a functional innate DNAsensing pathway in hepatocytes allows HBV to establish infection
and to replicate (Thomsen et al., 2016). As a consequence of
co-evolution, viruses have acquired the ability to counter the
antiviral response induced by type I IFN. First, some host factors
that are pro-HBV replication or antagonize the innate immunity
are induced after HBV infection. For instance, NF-κB essential
modulator (NEMO) has an essential role in the production of
IFN-β by phosphorylating and activating IFN regulatory factor
3 (IRF3) in a polyubiquitin-dependent manner (Clark et al.,
2013); and rubicon, a virus-induced protein, has been reported
to bind to NEMO, which inhibits the ubiquitination of NEMO
and further inhibits type I IFN production (Wan et al., 2017).
In addition, HBV-induced parkin can recruit a linear ubiquitin
assembly complex (LUBAC) to mitochondria and modulate K63 and the linear ubiquitin chain on the MAVS signalosome,
which abrogates IFN-β synthesis (Khan et al., 2016). These two
reports clearly indicate the mechanism of HBV in regulating
some of the critical factors in IFN production. Moreover, HBV
is also reported to inhibit IFN signaling by regulating IFNAR1,
and HBV-activated collagen triple helix repeat containing 1
(CTHRC1) reduces IFNAR1/2 expression and downregulates the
activity of type I IFN (Bai et al., 2015). However, how IFNAR1/2
is reduced has not been clarified. Interestingly, another report
has shown that HBV can induce matrix metalloproteinase 9
(MMP9), which binds to IFNAR1, promotes its degradation via
ubiquitination, and suppresses IFN/JAK/STAT signaling (Chen
et al., 2017).
Second, HBV or viral proteins also have been clearly reported
to inhibit IFN production. Major vault protein (MVP) is a
novel virus-induced cellular protein that upregulates type I
IFN production. The middle domain of MVP (amino acid
residues 310–620) is essential for MyD88 binding; interestingly,
both HBsAg and HBeAg have been shown to suppress the
interaction between MVP and MyD88 (Kawai et al., 2004),
which leads to limiting the downstream IFN signaling (Liu S.
et al., 2015). In addition, HBV Pol has been shown to interact
with STING and to decrease the Lys63-linked polyubiquitination
of STING dramatically, resulting in inhibiting the activation
of STING-stimulated IRF3 and decreasing the induction of
IFN-β (Liu Y. et al., 2015). Moreover, Pol has been reported
to evade the innate immune response in the early phase of
infection, thus interrupting the interaction between the inhibitor
of NF-κB kinase (IKK) ε and DDX3 DEAD box RNA helicase
as well as inhibit TBK1/IKKε activity (Wang and Ryu, 2010).

FIGURE 3 | Classical interferon (IFN) and IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) induction in response to viral infection. In the cytoplasm, viral DNA is recognized by cGAS,
DDX41, or IFI16, leading to the activation of STING, which further recruits TBK1 for IRF activation and translocates to the nucleus to initiate IFN production. Viral
RNA is detected by RIG-I and MDA5, and recruits another adaptor protein: MAVS (IPS-1), resulting in TBK1 activation, IRF phosphorylation, and IFN induction. Then,
IFNs are secreted from the cells and bind to IFNAR1/2, leading to JAK/STAT activation. The activated ISGF3 trimer or STAT1 dimer bind to the ISRE or GAS
sequence and promote the expression of ISGs. ISGs inhibit HBV as shown in the black box. cGAS, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase; DDX41, DEAD-box protein 41; IFI16,

Interestingly, HBV viral particles have appeared to readily inhibit
the innate immune response through virion/cell interactions
(Luangsay et al., 2015), which might partially explain the
“stealthy” characteristics of HBV. In vitro, upon infection of
primary hepatocytes with HBV, both type I and III IFN transcripts
were suppressed to 10% of the levels observed in uninfected
cultures, suggesting an active role for HBV in suppressing innate
immune activation from the side (Ortega-Prieto et al., 2018).
Another viral protein is HBx, which is a 17-kDa protein,
consisting of an N-terminal negative regulatory domain and
a C-terminal transactivation or co-activation domain (Gong
et al., 2013). HBx may function as a transactivator and appears
to regulate the expression of cellular genes; in addition, it is
implicated in the development of HCC (Zhang et al., 2017).
HBx interacts with several cellular proteins and impacts HBV
replication through these interactions. The best-characterized
HBx binding partner is damage-specific DNA binding protein
1 (DDB1), and the interaction between HBx and DDB1 is
essential for HBV replication (Hodgson et al., 2012). HBx induces
cytokine signaling 3 and protein phosphatase 2A suppression,
impairing IFN signaling (Tsunematsu et al., 2017). HBx has been
reported to elevate MSL2 expression and degrade APOBEC3B,
leading to cccDNA accumulation and hepatocarcinogenesis (Gao
et al., 2017). HBx also has been shown to induce a single CpG
methylation in the 50-UTR of the tripartite motif 22 (TRIM22)
gene and inhibit IFN-induced TRIM22 expression (Lim et al.,
2017). These reports demonstrate that HBx has a negative impact
on interrupting IFN signaling and producing both IFN and
ISGs. Several reports have shown that HBx targets the structural
maintenance of chromosomes (SMC)5/6 complex to enhance
HBV gene expression from episomal cccDNA (Murphy et al.,
2016; Livingston et al., 2017). It has been reported that the
SMC complex is not induced by IFN. However, SMC5/6 forms
the foundation of a multi-subunit DNA repair complex and
is a restriction factor that selectively blocks extrachromosomal
DNA transcription (Uhlmann, 2016). Moreover, it has been
demonstrated that HBx binds to the DDB1 subunit of the DDB1-
containing E3 ubiquitin ligase and forms an HBx-DDB1-cullin
4-ROC1 E3 ligase complex for ubiquitin-mediated degradation
of SMC5/6 complexes (Decorsiere et al., 2016), which lift the
restriction of HBV gene expression from episomal cccDNA.
A disruption of the interaction between HBx and host proteins
might increase the efficiency of IFN treatment (Figure 4).
Hepatitis B virus DNA has been reported to be recognized
by cGAS, resulting in activation of the cGAS-STING pathway,
which can suppress HBV replication by inducing ISG56 (IFIT1)
(Dansako et al., 2016). However, IFN induction is not presented
in this report. In addition, HBV pgRNA can be recognized by

Tan et al. When Hepatitis B Virus Meets Interferon
FIGURE 4 | Hepatitis B virus interrupts interferon (IFN) signaling. As indicated, HBV induces several host factors, including rubicon, parkin, MMP9, and CTHRC1.
These proteins inhibit IFN production in a different mechanism, and HBV proteins including HBx, Pol (polymerase), HBsAg, and HBeAg can also block IFN induction
or directly inhibit ISG induction. Please see the text for details. MVP, major vault protein; MMP9, matrix metalloproteinase 9; NEMO, nuclear factor-κB essential

RIG-I, leading to induction of type III but not type I IFN (Sato
et al., 2015). HBV replication generates both DNA and RNA
species; therefore, many more studies are required to elucidate
the complicated mechanisms involved in the immune response
to HBV infection.
Hepatitis B virus pgRNA represents another target by the
host immunity as it is recognized by RIG-I, thus eliciting type
III IFN induction (Sato et al., 2015), which can also inhibit
HBV replication (Hong et al., 2007; Pagliaccetti et al., 2010;
Tian et al., 2014). In our recent study, we have found that
type III IFN inhibits HBV replication through inducing corebinding factor beta (CBFβ). It is known that CBFβ suppresses
the formation of the HBx-DDB1-SMC5/6 complex, which blocks
HBx transcriptional activity (Xu et al., 2018).
Taken together, there is complicated crosstalk between HBV
and IFN/ISGs. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the
mechanisms responsible for the HBV-mediated inhibition of IFN
is needed for designing and developing immunology-based HBV
therapy.
HOW ISGs INHIBIT HBV REPLICATION
Many ISGs are known to inhibit HBV replication. One of them is
the APOBEC gene, which encodes a family of cytidine deaminases
that edit DNA and/or RNA bases by deaminating cytidine and
converting it to uridine. A total of 11 members of this family
are encoded by the human genome (Vieira and Soares, 2013),
among which APOBEC3A/B has been shown to be induced by
IFN, resulting in cytidine deamination, apurinic/apyrimidinic
site formation, and finally cccDNA degradation that prevents
HBV reactivation in HBV-infected cells (Lucifora et al., 2014).
We also have reported that APOBEC3G inhibits HBV replication
and that IFN-induced APOBEC3G is STAT3 but not STAT1
dependent. However, A3G expression is reduced in HBV-infected
patients, which might due to the inhibition of STAT3 by HBsAg
(Xu et al., 2016).
In addition, ISG20 inhibits HBV replication through directly
binding to the epsilon stem-loop structure of pgRNA (Liu et al.,
2017). Indoleamine-pyrrole 2,3-dioxygenase, an IFN-induced
enzyme catalyzing tryptophan degradation, has been found to
reduce the intracellular HBV DNA level efficiently by tryptophan
deprivation without altering the steady-state level of viral RNA
(Mao et al., 2011). Myxovirus resistance protein 1 (MxA)
interacts with the HBV core protein, which might interfere with
capsid assembly (Li et al., 2012). The 20,50-linked oligoadenylate
is synthesized by a family of enzymes named oligoadenylate
synthetases, a type I IFN-inducible gene. RNase L binds to
2
0
,50-linked oligoadenylate to activate it, thus inhibiting HBV
RNAs (Park et al., 2014). In addition, squamous cell carcinoma
Frontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 6 July 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 1611

Tan et al. When Hepatitis B Virus Meets Interferon
antigen recognized by T cells (SART) is involved in regulating
ISG expression against HBV infection after IFN treatment (Li
et al., 2016). Interestingly, miR-122 also has been reported to be
induced by IFN, thus inhibiting HBV replication by targeting
suppressor of cytokine signaling 3, a molecule contributing to
inactivation of the IFN signaling pathway (Gao et al., 2015;
Figure 3).
In recent years, several TRIM-containing family members,
which are also categorized as ISGs, have been found to be
important in regulating IFN signaling and inhibiting HBV
replication (Zhang et al., 2013). They comprise a really interesting
new gene (RING) domain, one or two B-box domains, and an
associated coiled-coil domain in the amino-terminal region and
share RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (Torok and Etkin,
2001; Ozato et al., 2008; Rajsbaum et al., 2014). As reported
by us and others, TRIM expression is induced in response
to IFN stimulation and is required to control viral infections
(Uchil et al., 2013; Versteeg et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2016; Tan
G. et al., 2017). We have found that TRIM25 expression is
elevated under the induction of type I IFN in an interleukin27-dependent manner, thus inhibiting HBV replication through
augmenting IFN production (Tan G. et al., 2017). TRIM22
also has been shown to inhibit HBV core promoter activity
(Gao et al., 2009). Among the TRIMs, TRIM14 has recently
emerged as an attractive gene that regulates IFN signaling.
TRIM14 recruits ubiquitin-specific protease 14 to cleave the
lysine (Lys) 48-linked ubiquitin chains of cGAS at Lys414 and
facilitates the activation of type I IFN signaling, thus inhibiting
p62-mediated autophagic degradation of cGAS (Chen et al.,
2016). TRIM14 undergoes Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination at
Lys-365 and recruits the NEMO to the MAVS signalosome,
activating both the IRF3 and NF-κB pathways, which enhance the
innate immune response (Zhou et al., 2014). In addition, RIG-Imediated innate antiviral immunity has been reported to require
TRIM14 to form a Werner helicase interacting protein–TRIM14–
phosphoprotein phosphatase 6C mitochondrial signalosome
(Tan P. et al., 2017). TRIM31 also has been shown to inhibit
HBV replication and regulate IFN signaling. Mechanistically,
the interaction between TRIM31 and MAVS catalyzes the Lys63
(K63)-linked polyubiquitination of Lys10, Lys311, and Lys461 on
MAVS, which forms prion-like aggregates of MAVS in response
to viral infection (Liu et al., 2016). In addition, additional
TRIMs (e.g., TRIM56, Tsuchida et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2011;
Shen et al., 2012 and TRIM38, Hu et al., 2016), potential
regulators of HBV replication, have been shown to regulate IFN
production (Figure 3). TRIMs might be potential targets for HBV
therapy.
RATIONAL FOR IFN-BASED TREATMENT
OF CHRONIC HEPATITIS B
Interferon-α has been used for treating chronic hepatitis B for
over two decades. Three guidelines are recommended by the
American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD):
(1) risk for virological relapse, hepatic decompensation, liver
cancer, and death; (2) financial concerns; and (3) preference of
the patient (Ghany, 2017). Because of parenteral administration,
severe side effects, and less effective inhibition of HBV DNA
replication, IFN-α is not a first-line drug recommended by the
guidelines, nor has it been widely used in the clinic (European
Association For The Study Of The Liver, 2012). Injectable
formulations of pegylated IFN-α (peg-IFN-α-2a and α-2b) are
available for HBV therapy (Tang et al., 2018). peg-IFN has a
longer half-life compared with standard IFN, so less frequent
dosing is required and more sustained viral suppression has been
shown in clinical trials compared with standard IFN (Cooksley
et al., 2003). The injection of pegylated IFN-α is administered
once a week in a dose of 180 µg for 48 weeks (Liaw et al., 2011).
Its use is limited by adverse effects including flu-like symptoms,
thyroid dysfunction, gastrointestinal symptoms, neutropenia,
and so on (Marcellin et al., 2004; Janssen et al., 2005; Lau et al.,
2005). According to the three major liver societies, the AASLD,
the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL), and
the Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver (APASL),
the IFN-α treatment guidelines are all similar (reviewed in Sato
et al., 2015).
Currently, 7 therapies are approved, including standard and
peg-IFN, and 5 nucleos(t)ide analogs (NAs) (NUCs: ADV,
adefovir; ETV, entecavir; LMV, lamivudine; TBV, telbivudine;
TDF, tenofovir), in which Peg-IFN, ETV, and TDF was
recommended by the guidelines of major liver associations
(Lok and McMahon, 2009; European Association For The
Study Of The Liver, 2012; Liaw et al., 2012). Despite the
adverse effects, IFN shows a better efficacy in inducing higher
percentages of HBeAg loss as well as HBsAg loss compared to
nucleoside or NAs (Konerman and Lok, 2016). Several reports
showed that the outcome of peg-IFN combining with LMV
treatment was similar compared to peg-IFN alone (Marcellin
et al., 2004; Janssen et al., 2005; Lau et al., 2005; Buster et al.,
2008). It was also reported that TDF plus peg-IFN treatment
increased the loss of HBsAg than those receiving TDF or pegIFN alone (Marcellin et al., 2016). Peg-IFN-α-2b combination
with ADV therapy inhibited viral productivity by 99% and
subsequent ADV monotherapy by 76%, while with only a small
number of patients involved (24 patients), this clinical trial
is limited (Lutgehetmann et al., 2008). Switch to TBV after
24 weeks of Peg-IFNα-2a therapy was shown to promote HBeAg
seroconversion that merits investigation in HBeAg-positive CHB
patients (Luo et al., 2017). Sequential approaches with pegIFN and NUCs were also tested, however, no significant benefit
was noted (Xie et al., 2014; Brouwer et al., 2015). It was
reported that patients started to resistant to NUCs after long
term therapy, interestingly, after subcutaneous peg-IFN add-on
treatment, anti-HBs antibody appeared, which suggested pegIFN might benefit HBsAg seroconversion (Ouzan et al., 2013;
Stanzione et al., 2016). And peg-IFN monotherapy showed
greater advantages in HBeAg seroconversion compared to pegIFN-LMV combination or LMV monotherapy (32 and 27% vs.
19%) (Lau et al., 2005). The combination of high-dose peg-IFN
and NAs resulted in sustained loss of serum HBV DNA and other
HBV markers in an immunodeficient mouse model (Uchida
et al., 2017), suggesting that HBV replication can be effectively
inhibited by antivirals in the absence of a cellular immune

response. A recombinant human serum albumin (rHSA)-IFNα2a fusion protein is under development and aims to extend the
in vivo half-life of IFN-α. The data from clinical trials reveal that
rHSA/IFNα2a is well tolerated and effective at inhibiting HBV
DNA (Ding et al., 2017).
Interferon treatment stayed a good alternative for people with
a good prognosis (young age, low viral load, and female gender)
(Sokal et al., 1998; Roberts, 2000). And due to different HBV
genotype, HBeAg positive or negative stage of liver disease PegIFN therapy shows different response and outcome (Konerman
and Lok, 2016), therefore, precision treatment should be created
for every individual patient.
Recently, a combination therapy of IFN-λ with entecavir was
assessed for its efficacy in treating chronic hepatitis B patients,
and the trial data showed a more profound decrease in the levels
of HBV DNA, HBsAg, and HBeAg compared with entecavir
monotherapy (European Association For The Study Of The Liver,
2012; Phillips et al., 2017). Since only 13 patients were involved
in this clinical trial, the results need to be further confirmed
with many more chronic hepatitis B patient samples. Despite
the severe side effects, the NAs may induce IFN-λ3 production,
which triggers the expression of ISGs and reduces the HBsAg
level (Murata et al., 2018). If we can clarify the exact inhibition
mechanism involved in this process, a cure for HBV infection will
be just around the corner.
GS-9620, a toll-like receptor 7 agonist, which was first
evaluated in HBV-infected chimpanzees in 2013 (Lanford
et al., 2013), has demonstrated a prolonged inhibition of HBV
replication via a type I IFN-dependent mechanism (Niu et al.,
2017). In combination with a NA, GS-9620 appears to increase
T-cell and natural killer cell responses and to reduce the
ability of natural killer cells to suppress T cells in chronic
hepatitis B patients, raising the possibility that GS-9620 might
potentially be used as an adjunct drug in HBV treatment to
augment the immune response to HBV (Boni et al., 2018).
However, comparing the data from chimpanzees and woodchuck
models (Lanford et al., 2013; Menne et al., 2015), a much
lower efficacy of GS-9620 in clinical trials in humans has
been reported, since no significant effect was shown on serum
HBsAg levels, tempering the previous expectation (Agarwal
et al., 2018; Boni et al., 2018). The reason for this finding
might be that the animals received higher doses (in terms
of concentration and/or frequency) than those used in CHB
patients.
Hepatitis B virus cccDNA resides as an episomal template in
nuclei of infected hepatocytes. Although the average cccDNA
copy number per cell is low (10 copies in a duck liver
cell and 0.1–1 copies in a human liver cell) (Zhang et al.,
2003; Volz et al., 2013), persistent or residual cccDNA is
the reason why recurrent HBV infection occurs in resolved
patients. A complete cure of HBV infection is a functional cure
plus cccDNA elimination (Durantel, 2017). The impact of IFN
treatment on cccDNA is a subject for debate. For instance,
in some reports, cccDNA remains at a similar level in IFNtreated primary human hepatocytes (Niu et al., 2017; Shen
et al., 2017; Mutz et al., 2018). However, other reports have
shown a significant decrease in the cccDNA level after IFN
treatment (Chuaypen et al., 2017; Mu et al., 2017). In addition,
IFN-α has been shown to repress HBV cccDNA transcriptional
activity by an epigenetic modification (Belloni et al., 2012).
Moreover, a novel site-specific PEGylated recombinant human
IFN-β (TRK-560) demonstrates a stronger antiviral potency
by inducing a higher expression of ISGs and a stronger
stimulation of immune cell chemotaxis compared with PEGIFN-α2a. Furthermore, the reduction of cccDNA under TRK-560
treatment in vivo was significantly higher than that by PEGIFN-α2a treatment (Tsuge et al., 2017). However, the cccDNA
synthetic process involves several host enzymes that could be
difficult to target as they are also required for other biological
functions. Eradication of HBV from an infected liver requires
elimination of cccDNA (Nassal, 2015), which appears to be
unrealistic at this moment.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE OUTLOOK
Evolution has equipped the human immune system with effective
strategies to defend against viral infections. IFN production
and signaling represent the most studied as well as the earliest
immune response. Upon HBV infection, both HBV DNA and
pgRNA can be recognized by both a DNA sensor (cGAS) and
an RNA sensor (RIG-I). However, only type III but not type I
IFN is induced in infected hepatocytes, which might reflect a
lack of or inactive DNA sensing pathways in hepatocytes (Cheng
et al., 2017). IFN-α has demonstrated the ability to reduce the
levels of HBV DNA, HBsAg, and cccDNA efficiently. Specific
and efficient activation of the IFN pathway in HBV patients
might represent one treatment strategy to eradicate HBV from an
infected liver. However, the challenge is that the antiviral function
of IFN is compromised by the presence of HBV. As discussed
above, most crosstalk between IFN and HBV is mediated by
the interactions between ISG proteins and HBV proteins. For
example, rubicon binds to NEMO, MMP9 binds to IFNAR,
Pol interacts with STING, parkin recruits LUBAC, and HBx
targets SMC5/6. All these protein interactions are deleterious
to IFN signaling and benefit HBV infection. Therefore, small
molecules designed to interfere with these interactions may
interrupt the inhibition of IFN signaling by HBV and viral
products.
