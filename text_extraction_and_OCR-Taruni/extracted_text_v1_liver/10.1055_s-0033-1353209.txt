Olive Oil Attenuates the Cholesterol-induced 
Development of Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Despite 
Increased Insulin Resistance in a Rodent Model
 NASH development is thought to begin with 
hepatic steatosis due to diet-induced dysregulation of hepatic lipid metabolism with an overstraining of hepatic fatty acid metabolism, 
decreased fatty acid export, and increased lipogenesis; this is aggravated by an increased 
peripheral lipolysis in obese subjects [ 5 – 8 ] . 
Hepatic steatosis increases cellular susceptibility 
to various stressors, for example, fatty acidderived oxidative stress, environmental toxins or 
proinfl ammatory cytokines arising from the portal venous system leading to endoplasmic reticulum stress and the activation of hepatic stellate 
cells, which is the key event of hepatic fi brosis 
 [ 9 ] . The well-documented perturbations of insulin action and the altered adipokine profi le associated with diet-induced obesity such as 
decreased adiponectin and elevated leptin levels 
add to the proinfl ammatory context [ 10 ] .
 One area of uncertainty in this hypothesis is the 
role of the fat type in hepatic fat deposition, 
development of hepatic infl ammation and the 
Introduction

 In the last years, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis 
(NASH) has emerged not only as a new feature of 
the metabolic syndrome but also as one of the 
main underlying factors behind cryptogenic liver 
fi brosis and cirrhosis [ 1 ] . In a recent study, the 
prevalence of NASH in biopsies obtained after 
sonographic screening of middle-aged US-Americans was as high as 12 % [ 2 ] , which points to the 
tremendous impact of this disease in the general 
population. This is even more aggravated in 
obese subjects, where, depending on the histopathologic criteria used, NASH prevalence rates 
between 25 and 75 % have been reported [ 3 ] . 
Although the association between diet-induced 
hepatic fat deposition, insulin resistance, and 
liver fi brogenesis has clearly been shown in multiple studies (recently reviewed in [ 4 ] ) the exact 
causal relationship between these phenomena as 
a basis for future therapeutic concepts remains 
to be defi ned.

Abstract
▼
 It is indefi nite whether nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) results as by-product from general 
metabolic perturbations and adipokine dysregulations or whether defi ned dietary factors also 
play a pathogenetic role. Here, we examine the 
eff ects of a modifi cation of dietary lipids in a 
NASH inducing diet on metabolic changes as well 
as hepatic steatosis, infl ammation, and fi brosis 
in rats. Male Wistar rats were fed with variations of the atherogenic diet (AD), which induces 
pathophysiological changes resembling human 
NASH. Dietary variants (AD without cholesterol, 
cholate, or choline; change of neutral fat to olive 
oil or coconut oil) were fed for 8 weeks. Insulin 
resistance, adipokine profi le, liver histology, and 
lipid content as well as expression of proinfl ammatory and profi brogenic genes were examined. AD led to clear signs of hepatic steatosis 
and infl ammation together with an increase in 
TNF and collagen type 1 expression. AD without 
cholesterol showed markedly less liver damage 
without changes of insulin action and adipokine 
profi le. AD with olive oil and AD without cholate clearly attenuated hepatic infl ammation, 
whereas fat deposition and features of the metabolic syndrome were increased in these animals. 
Insulin resistance and hepatic fat deposition per 
se do not cause signifi cant hepatic infl ammation 
in this rodent model. However, dietary cholesterol is an important causal agent for the development of NASH. Olive oil plays a protective role 
in this respect, which might be due to the high 
content of monounsaturated fatty acids.

associated metabolic dysregulation. Clinical studies have demonstrated an increased dietary intake of saturated fatty acids 
and cholesterol as well as a decreased ratio of dietary polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acids in patients with NASH [ 11 , 12 ] . 
Saturated fatty intake also correlated with hepatic triglyceride 
accumulation and insulin resistance [ 11 ] . In high fat fed rodent 
models, diff erential eff ects with respect to insulin resistance and 
liver fat accumulation were detected depending on the type of 
dietary fat: saturated fat dominated diets led to both hepatic 
steatosis and insulin resistance, whereas monounsaturated fats 
only increased liver triglyceride content without signifi cantly 
changing insulin action [ 13 ] . Experimental data at the cell culture level show increased apoptosis of hepatocyte [ 14 ] and disruption of endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis [ 15 ] induced by 
saturated fatty acids; this was not seen when employing polyunsaturated controls.
 High fat feeding in itself does not reliably induce hepatic infl ammation in mice or rats [ 13 ] . The lack of a purely diet-induced 
rodent NASH model has been a drawback for the further elucidation of NASH pathogenesis, as hepatitis models employing toxins, bile duct ligation or nutrient defi cient diets do not refl ect 
the clinical situation well. Recently, an atherogenic diet initially 
described by Paigen et al. [ 16 , 17 ] has been shown to induce 
hepatic fat deposition and infl ammation, and appears to be suitable for the dissection of diet-phenotype interactions in NASH. 
In this study, we have therefore examined morphologic, metabolic, and molecular parameters of diet-induced nonalcoholic 
steatohepatitis in diff erent variations of the atherogenic diet 
with respect to fat components and fatty acid subtypes.
Materials and Methods
▼
Experimental animals
 Male Wistar rats were purchased at the age of 6 weeks from 
Charles River (Sulzfeld, Germany). The rats were caged singly 
with free access to water and subjected to diff erent dietary 
regimes as described below. The standardized diets were prepared in pellet form by ssniff GmbH (Soest, Germany) using 
purifi ed components. Animals were held on a 12:12-h light-dark 
cycle. All animal procedures complied with the German Law on 
Animal Protection as well as the UFAW Handbook on the Care 
and Management of Laboratory Animals, 2010.
Experimental design
 After 3 days of acclimatization, the rats (5 animals per group) 
were fed ad libitum with either a standard rodent chow (SC, fat 
content 11 energy percent), or the atherogenic diet (AD) fi rst 
described by Paigen et al., containing approximately 15 weight 
percent of neutral fat, 1.25 % cholesterol, and 0.5 % cholate by 
mass [ 17 ] , or with variants of AD. For this, diff erent dietary components of AD were selectively omitted, resulting in the diet 
types (i) AD without cholesterol (AD-cholesterol), (ii) AD without choline (AD-choline), and (iii) AD without cholate (AD-cholate), respectively. In other AD variations, only the diet’s 
predominant fatty acid was changed by using alternative neutral 
fat sources to achieve a pronunciation of either monounsaturated cis- or middle chain saturated fatty acids: (iv) AD with 
olive oil, (AD/O) and (v) AD with coconut oil (AD/C). All diets 
were stored at 4 °C, feeding quality was verifi ed by measuring 
food intake on a daily basis. After 8 weeks, the animals were sacrifi ced after an overnight fast (16 h). Venous blood was drawn 
from the heart into EDTA-coated vials, and plasma was prepared 
and stored at − 20 °C pending further analysis. The right ventral 
liver lobe was removed, partially fi xed in 10 % neutral buff ered 
formaldehyde and partially frozen in liquid nitrogen. In H & E 
stained sections liver steatosis and infl ammation were semiquantitatively assessed by a blinded liver pathology expert 
(E.G.). The degrees of steatosis and infl ammation were scored 
separately (0 = no steatosis/infl ammation, 1 = minimal steatosis/
infl ammation, 2 = moderate steatosis/infl ammation, 3 = severe 
steatosis/infl ammation). Ten fi elds of view were examined at a 
400 × magnifi cation from each liver section, and the mean scores 
of steatosis and infl ammation were calculated fi rst for each individual animal and then for the diff erent experimental groups. 
Unless otherwise stated, all reagents were purchased from 
Sigma (St. Louis, USA) or Merck Eurolab (Darmstadt, Germany) 
at the highest purity grade available.
Biochemical measurements
 Plasma glucose was measured enzymatically with an appropriate commercial kit (Sigma); insulin, leptin, and adiponectin 
were measured using rat-specifi c ELISA kits (Mercodia, Uppsala, 
Sweden; Linco Research, St. Charles, USA). The HOMA-Index was 
calculated as follows: HOMA-Index = Glucose (mmol/l) × Insulin 
(pmol/l)/155 [ 18 ] . Plasma aminotransferases, cholesterol and 
triglycerides were measured by standard assays on the cobas 
8 000 analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) in the 
Clinical Chemistry laboratory of the Nuremberg Hospital. The 
liver tissue triglyceride content was determined after lipid 
extraction using a GPO-triglyceride kit (Sigma, St. Louis USA) as 
described previously [ 13 ] .
mRNA analysis
 Total RNA from liver was isolated using a Qiagen RNeasy R kit 
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Real-time RT-PCR was performed as 
described in detail elsewhere [ 6 ] . In brief, fi rst strand complementary cDNA was synthesized from equal amounts of total 
RNA by priming with arbitrary hexamers. For subsequent PCR 
amplifi cation (Standard RT-PCR and LightCycler TM system, Roche 
Diagnostics, Germany), the following primer pairs (1 μmol/l, 
Metabion, Martinsried, Germany) were employed: i) rat collagen 
I, 5′-AAG AGG CGA GAG AGG TTT CC-3′ (sense)/5′-AGA ACC ATC 
AGC ACC TTT G-3′ (antisense); ii) rat tumor necrosis factor, 5′- 
GTC GTA GCA AAC CAC CAA GC-3′ (sense)/5′-TGT GGG TGA GGA 
GCA CAT AG-3′ (antisense), iii) rat 18 s rRNA, 5′-TCA AGA ACG 
AAA GTC GGA G-3′ (sense)/5′-GGA CAT CTA AGG GCA TCA CA-3′
(antisense). After verifi cation of the RT-PCR products by gel electrophoresis, a LightCycler TM analysis was performed with the 
same temperature protocol. The formation of primer-dimers 
was ruled out by melting curve analysis. The cDNA content for a 
specifi c gene in each sample was semiquantitatively assessed by 
comparing the experimentally determined crossing point with 
the crossing points and respective concentrations of a pooled 
standard cDNA.

Weight gain and basal metabolic characterization
 During the diet phase no signifi cant diff erences in food intake 
were noted. The animals’ mean body weight increased 2.9 ± 0.1-
fold during the diet phase; signifi cant diff erences between the 
diet groups with respect to relative weight gain or fi nal body

weight ( ●▶ Table 1 ) were not noted. Fasting blood glucose and 
leptin did not diff er between the diff erent dietary regimes. The 
fasting insulin level was approximately doubled in AD/O rats 
when compared to AD (p < 0.05), which resulted in an almost 
3-fold increase in the HOMA-index in this specifi c group compared to AD (p < 0.05), while the diff erence was not signifi cant 
when comparing to SC. AD/O rats also showed the lowest adiponectin levels of all AD variations: compared to AD, adiponectin was lowered by approximately 35 % (p < 0.05), and compared 
to SD it decreased by almost 60 % (p < 0.05). While all AD variations showed higher liver triglyceride (TG) levels than SD, this 
diff erence was most pronounced in AD-cholate, where liver TG 
was elevated almost 6-fold compared to SD and almost doubled 
when compared to AD (p < 0.05). Liver TG levels tended to be 
decreased in AD-cholesterol when compared to AD, but this difference did not reach statistical signifi cance. Plasma cholesterol 
was approximately 2-fold higher in animals fed with original AD 
compared to AD-cholesterol and not signifi cantly diff erent 
between the other groups ( ●▶ Table 2 ). While the absolute 
plasma levels of the alanine (ALT) and aspartate (AST) aminotransferase where not clearly diff erent between the groups, 
the deRitis quotient (AST/ALT) as a marker of hepatocellular 
damage was elevated in original AD and signifi cantly lowered in 
AD-cholesterol as well as in AD/O.
Liver histology
 The eff ect of the diff erent atherogenic diet variations on hepatic 
steatosis and infl ammation was fi rst examined histologically. 
Representative H & E stained sections and the histological score 
values for these parameters are shown in ●▶ Fig. 1, 2 .
 Animals fed with original AD diet revealed moderate to severe 
periportal infl ammation with some single cell necrosis and 
severe hepatocellular steatosis, whereas standard chow fed controls showed neither signs of infl ammation nor of steatosis. 
Omitting the choline component did not signifi cantly aff ect 
hepatic infl ammation or steatosis, but rats fed with AD lacking 
cholate (AD-Cholate) or lacking cholesterol (AD-Cholesterol) 
showed marked improvements of both parameters into the 
range of standard chow fed rats (p < 0.05). When changing the 
dietary neutral fat to olive or coconut oil, we observed no change 
in the extent of hepatic fat deposition, while the infl ammation 
score was signifi cantly decreased from 2 ± 0.75 to 0.5 ± 0.5 in 
AD/O compared to AD (p < 0.05).
Expression of proinfl ammatory and profi brogenic 
molecules
 To verify the histologic changes described above, we examined 
the mRNA expression of collagen I as marker of fi brogenesis and 
of tumor necrosis factor as marker of infl ammation in liver tissue from diff erentially fed rats. As can be seen in ●▶ Fig. 3 , collagen I expression was reduced to standard chow diet levels in rats 
fed with AD-cholesterol and AD-cholate, and it was reduced by 
70 ± 20 % and 80 ± 10 %, respectively in rats fed with AD/O and 
AD/C (p < 0.05). Tumor necrosis factor expression was lowered 
signifi cantly only in AD-cholesterol by 60 ± 30 %; in AD-cholate, 
AD/O and AD/C there was a trendwise reduction of about 50 %, 
which did not reach statistical signifi cance. Omitting choline 
from the diet did not lead to any signifi cant expression changes.
Discussion
▼
 In this study, we have demonstrated that dietary fat components, in particular cholesterol and certain acyl moieties, 
determine the degree of diet-induced hepatic steatosis and 
infl ammation. Unexpectedly, these fat-induced eff ects on the 
liver appear to be independent of the metabolic profi le in the 
rodent model of non alcoholic steatohepatitis employed in this 
study.

diet, AD) we observed marked hepatic fat deposition and periportal infl ammation in comparison to conventionally fed rats. 
Furthermore, this diet leads to a signifi cant upregulation of the 
proinfl ammatory cytokine TNF, which is known to play an 
important pathophysiological role in NASH progression. Moreover, rats fed with this diet revealed increased hepatic collagen 
type I expression, indicative of beginning fi brosis.
 Variations of this diet have been routinely used up to now to 
generate and modulate atherosclerosis, respectively, but only 
few researchers have examined the eff ects of this dietary intervention on liver histology before. An AD-induced activation of 
the transcription factor NFΚB in the liver tissue was observed as 
early as 1993 [ 19 ] but the link between steatohepatitis and the 
metabolic syndrome was not known at that time. Similar to our 
results, recent reports by Dorn et al. and Matuszawa et al. demonstrated hepatomegaly together with histologic features 
resembling human NASH such as steatosis, fi brosis, cellular ballooning and increased TNF and MCP-1 levels in C57/BL6 mice

after 12–24 weeks of an atherogenic diet composed nearly equal 
to the AD employed in this study [ 17 , 20 ] .
 In order to further characterize the individual pathophysiological 
impact of AD components on hepatic damage and metabolic perturbations we modifi ed the diff erent diet components such as the 
cholesterol concentration and the diet’s fatty acid composition. 
The dietary triacylglycerol content itself was not increased, as this 
might lead to a severe nutritional imbalance in such an “atherogenic-high fat” diet, which could be argued to be of harm in itself.
 This approach led to several observations. An AD variation without cholesterol supplementation, but with same energy content 
derived from fat, did not cause relevant hepatic steatosis, infl ammation or fi brosis. This clearly argues for an important pathophysiologic role of dietary cholesterol in this steatohepatitis 
model. Several recent animal studies and clinical observations 
underscore the assumption that dietary cholesterol is associated 
with hepatic infl ammation. In patients suff ering from NASH, 
mean cholesterol intake was elevated when compared to healthy 
controls and hepatic free cholesterol increased gradually from 
NAFLD to NASH [ 11 , 18 , 21 ] . In LDL receptor knockout mice, 
NMR-metabolomic studies indicate a causal association between 
dietary cholesterol and hepatic infl ammation [ 22 ] , which might 
be mediated by Kupff er cell scavenger receptors [ 23 ] . A further 
study showed only a slight infl ammatory reaction in the liver as 
assessed by expression analysis of proinfl ammatory markers 
when using a high fat diet containing only 0.2 % cholesterol [ 24 ] , 
which is substantially less than in the AD used in this study. 
Interestingly, the inhibition of endogenous cholesterol synthesis
does not seem to exert positive eff ects in human NASH, as a 
recent clinical study shows that cholesterol-synthesis blocking 
statins do not decrease the extent of hepatic infl ammation in 
patients with NASH [ 25 ] . Taken together, these data together 
with our results hint to a possibly dose-dependent eff ect of dietary cholesterol on hepatic infl ammation and argue against an 
unspecifi c toxic reaction. Therefore, dose-response eff ects as 
well as the eff ect of regulatory cholesterol intermediates (e. g., 
oxysterols) should be examined in further studies.
 Notably, in our model, cholesterol did not appear to have an 
intrinsic steatogenic eff ect with respect to liver triglyceride content, as suggested by Basciano et al. when looking at a hamster 
model [ 26 ] . In contrast to our study, these authors employed a 
combination of a high fructose (40 weight %) and much more 
neutral fat enriched (30 weight %) dietary regimen, so it might 
be speculated that cholesterol facilitated hepatic triglyceride 
deposition from these external sources. Whether dietary reduction of cholesterol intake can infl uence human NASH progression should be determined in clinical studies.
 There is ample evidence that the dietary fatty acid structure 
infl uences aspects of immune response and infl ammation 
(reviewed in [ 27 ] ). Therefore, we examined the eff ect of AD variations containing either mainly medium chain length saturated 
acyl moieties (derived from coconut oil) or long chain monounsaturated oleic acid (from olive oil) with the standard AD, which 
predominantly consists of the long chain saturated palmitic acid 
from lard. The cholesterol component was not changed between 
the diets. Here, we found clear histological and at least trendwise molecular evidence for a protective eff ect of dietary olive 
oil on hepatic infl ammation, whereas the degree of steatosis 
itself was not decreased as previously described in rats fed with 
a methionine-choline defi cient diet [ 28 ] . The coconut oil containing AD variation did not show signifi cant changes to the 
original AD. Recent studies suggest several mechanisms, which 
could explain the diff erential dietary fatty acid eff ects observed 
here. Saturated fatty acids lead to endoplasmic reticulum stress 
and can induce c-Jun NH(2)- terminal kinase-mediated apoptosis, which is not the case for monounsaturated FFAs as oleate or 
palmitoleate [ 29 – 31 ] . In rats and rabbits challenged with an 
atherogenic diet, dietary olive oil has been reported to decrease 
microsomal lipid peroxidation and improve the hepatic antioxidant system [ 32 , 33 ] . Lipid peroxidation and tissue damage 
induced by chronic ethanol exposure in rats were reduced when 
the animals were fed with a virgin olive oil rich diet [ 34 ] , showing that the protective eff ects of olive oil are – at least to some 
extent – independent of the underlying damaging cause. However, it cannot be ruled out that indirect actions of olive oil on 
cholesterol metabolism also contribute to these benefi cial 
observations, as several reports have demonstrated that 
monounsaturated fatty acids also decrease hepatic cholesterol 
accumulation and increase biliary cholesterol clearance [ 35 , 36 ] . 
Additionally, it must be remembered that data coming from 
these experimental dietary regimes in rodents cannot be directly 
transferred to the human disease of steatohepatitis.
 Whereas the omission of dietary choline did not lead to signifi -
cant histologic or molecular changes, rats fed with AD lacking 
cholate showed a decrease of hepatic infl ammation and collagen 
synthesis. As other authors have found decreased intracellular 
cholesterol levels when omitting cholate from cholesterol rich 
diets [ 37 ] , it can be speculated that cholate contributes to intes1.4

circulation. Interestingly, the changes in AD-cholate were noted 
although the absolute liver triglyceride content was clearly elevated, which argues against the notion of hepatic fat being a 
causal factor for the infl ammatory process per se. When further 
examining the association between hepatic triglyceride content, 
metabolic changes, and infl ammation we found that the diet 
group with the lowest histological hepatic infl ammation index 
(AD-O) showed the lowest adiponectin and highest insulin levels 
together with an increase in hepatic triglyceride. This dissociation between early features of the metabolic syndrome and 
hepatic infl ammation has been noted before [ 38 ] . These observations demonstrate that insulin resistance and hypoadiponectinemia do not uniformly lead to rapidly developing 
hepatic infl ammation and point at a stronger causal role for singular dietary fat components than the general metabolic profi le.
 In summary, this study for the fi rst time demonstrates how individual diet components can infl uence diff erential aspects of 
fatty liver disease in rodents. In the experimental AD diet, the 
component mainly contributing to diet-induced steatosis is cholate, whereas variations of the neutral fat acyl moiety (at a fi xed 
content of 15 weight percent) turned out not to change the 
extent of hepatic triglyceride deposition. The component mainly 
contributing to diet-induced infl ammation was cholesterol, 
which could be counteracted most eff ectively by changing the 
neutral fat component from lard to olive oil. Infl ammation was 
not dependent on the degree of steatosis. Based on these fi ndings, variations of the atherogenic AD are a new unique model to 
study the diff erent steps in the pathogenesis of steatohepatitis 
without using a nutritionally imbalanced high fat or high fructose diet. Whether these data apply similarly to human steatohepatitis should be examined in prospective studies linking the 
individual uptake of distinct lipids and liver histology.
