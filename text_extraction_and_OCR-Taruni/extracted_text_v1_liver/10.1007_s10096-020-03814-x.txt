Abstract
Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patient groups at risk. We have previously
shown that the anti-CMV IgG seroprevalence in an urban region of Germany has changed over the last decades. Overall, a
decline from 63.7 to 57.25% had been observed between 1988–1997 and 1998–2008 (p < 0,001). Here, we continuously follow
the trends to the most recent decade 2009 to 2018. In a retrospective analysis, we determined the seroprevalence of CMV IgG
antibodies in our patient cohort, stratified by gender and selected groups at risk (e.g., patients with HIV infection; women of
childbearing age). The overall prevalence of anti-CMV IgG non-significantly declined further from 57.25% in 1998–2008 to
56.48% in 2009–2018 (p = 0.881). Looking at gender differences, overall CMV seroprevalence in males declined to 52.82%
(from 55.54% in 1998–2008; p = 0.0254), while it non-significantly increased in females to 59.80%. The high seroprevalence in
patients with a known HIV infection further increased from 87.46% in 1998–2008 to 92.93% in the current period (p = 0.9999).
In women of childbearing age, no significant changes over the last three decades could be observed. The CMV seroprevalence in
oncological patients was determined to be 60.64%. Overall, the former significant decline of CMV seroprevalence between the
decades 1988–1997 and 1998–2008 in this urban region of Germany slowed down to a non-significant decrease of 0.77% (1998–
2008 vs. 2009–2018). This might be an indicator that CMV seroprevalence has reached a plateau.

Introduction
Primary CMV infection in immunocompetent hosts may be
asymptomatic, or may cause mostly mild, self-limiting disease
with fever, fatigue, headaches, and myalgia [1, 2]. After primary infection, the virus remains latent. Infants and toddlers
are an import source of infection, as they can shed the virus by
urine or saliva for months or even years after infection [3, 4].
Primary infection, reactivation, or reinfection shortly before or during pregnancy can result in congenital CMV infection, which is estimated to lead to permanent disability in 1 to
2 cases per 1000 pregnant women in Germany [5], making it
the most common infectious cause of birth defects. Permanent
sequelae include sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), microcephaly, seizures, neurologic deficits, and retinitis.
Counseling about hygiene can lower the risk of anti-CMV
IgG negative women to get infected during pregnancy [5, 6].
The rate of SNHL appears to be similar for children born after
primary and non-primary maternal CMV infection, but seems
to be more severe in the primary maternal infection group [7].
In immunocompromised hosts, CMV poses a major burden
of disease. People living with HIV/AIDS usually have a high
rate of CMV seropositivity. Therefore, the risk of primary
CMV infection is low, but reactivation or reinfection as an
opportunistic infection most commonly manifests as retinitis,
colitis or esophagitis, hepatitis, encephalitis,
myeloradiculopathy, or pneumonia. Otherwise immunocompromised hosts, such as oncological patients and solid organ
or stem cell transplant recipients, are additional groups affected by increased risk of morbidity and mortality associated
with CMV.

Insight into the dynamics of CMV epidemiology is therefore highly relevant for diverse, vulnerable groups of patients.
Different areas of the world can be divided in low (50 to
70%) and high seroprevalence settings (> 70%) [8]. It is usually higher in low income countries [9–14]. A limited number
of studies have focused on the CMV seroprevalence in
Germany. In children and adolescents in Germany, a study
of the CMV IgG seroprevalence (KiGGS study, 2003–2006)
found a range between 21.4% in boys at 1–2 years of age and
33.5% in girls at 14–17 years of age. CMV seroprevalence
increased with age in both genders. Risk factors for higher
seroprevalence included migration background, place of birth
other than Germany, having attended daycare, and having
younger siblings [15]. In a study in the adult population of
Germany, sera collected throughout Germany in 1998, published 2018, the overall CMV seroprevalence was 56.7% and
also increased with age. It was higher in females (62.3%) than
in males (51.0%). Total seroprevalence in women of childbearing age (18 to 45 years of age) was 51.7%. The study also
identified risk factors associated with seropositivity, with
country of birth and age being the strongest independent factors [11].
The comparative changes of CMV seroprevalence
among the patients of the urban University Hospital of
Frankfurt, Germany, over the period of 1988 to 1997
and 1998 to 2008 have previously been assessed. An
overall decline in CMV seroprevalence among its patients without a known HIV infection from the first to
the second decade, decreasing from 63.70% to 57.25%,
was observed. This decrease in CMV seroprevalence
has also been observed in other studies in Germany
[13, 16] and, in some groups, in Spain [14], but not
in the USA [12]. The decrease has also been observed
in bone marrow donors in Germany [16]. In the former
study conducted in Frankfurt, females had a slightly
higher CMV seroprevalence than men (63.83% compared with 65.54% in 1988–1997 and 58.73% compared
with 55.54% in 1998–2008). Patients with a known
HIV infection had a significantly higher CMV seroprevalence (in females, 83.17% in 1988–1997 and 87.80%
in 1998–2008, in males, 88.76% in 1988–1997 and
87.32% in 1998–2008) [13].
In the current study, we set out to determine whether the
decline continued to the most recent decade, and especially
observed the changes over in time in two selected groups of
vulnerable patients, the developing fetus, examined in proxy
by the status of their pregnant mothers, as well as people living
with HIV/AIDS.
As another important group affected by CMV disease, we
also looked at oncological patients. We determined the accumulated CMV seroprevalence of those patients whose samples were sent in from oncology wards, stratified by pediatric
and adult patients.
Material and methods
We conducted a retrospective analysis of the data routinely
acquired during patient care at the University Hospital of
Frankfurt. All results of anti-CMV IgG antibody tests from
our Institute of Medical Virology in the time frame January 1,
2009, and December 31, 2018, were analyzed. The University
Hospital of Frankfurt is the largest hospital and a maximum
care provider in Germany’s fifth largest city. It treats about
49,000 in-patients and 229,000 out-patients a year.
All anti-CMV IgG tests (Enzygnost anti-CMV IgG, Dade
Behring, Marburg, Germany) were performed on the Behring
ELISA Processor BEP 2000, the results were recorded semiquantitatively as arbitrary units per milliliter (AU/mL). The
test results of the decade 2009–2018 were compared with
the two decades of the former study (1988–1997; 1998–
2008) [13] in which the same diagnostic test had been used.
Patient collective
Due to the possibility of maternal antibody detection, infants
below the age of 1 year were excluded. Of each patient, only
the first CMV IgG test in the time period was considered, and
seropositivity defined as a positive result in the anti-CMV
antibody IgG assay. Patients with an unspecific or borderline
reactivity on the CMV IgG test were excluded. Group, ageand gender-dependent analysis was performed. The mathematical median of the positive test results was calculated.
Patients with a confirmed HIV infection were analyzed
separately to avoid bias by a higher-than-average CMV seroprevalence within this group and overrepresentation in our
patient cohort. Positive HIV status was defined as a positive
result in a 4th generation antibody/antigen-HIV screening test
followed by a positive confirmation test by HIV immunoblot
and/or HIV-PCR in the studied time period.
The data of all three decades was revisited to determine the
CMV IgG seroprevalence of women of childbearing age. We
chose samples of women of childbearing age sent in by our
Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, as testing of those
samples was presumed to be indicated by pregnancy or birth.
We compared the CMV seroprevalence in this group between
the three decades, and formed four age groups for comparative
analysis. Patients younger than 16 or older than 45 years of
age were excluded from age-dependent analysis, since there
were a relatively low number of those samples, and therefore,
CMV seroprevalence could not be determined with confidence. In addition, we determined the accumulated CMV seroprevalence of patients whose samples were sent in from an
oncological department or ward. We stratified by pediatric and
adult patients, defined by patient age. All patients younger
than 18 years of age were considered to be pediatric.
Statistical testing was performed using BiAS® for
Windows (version 11.10, epsilon-Verlag, Hochheim,
1096 Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis (2020) 39:1095–1102

Germany, 2019), including the calculation of the 95% confidence intervals. P values were calculated using the two-tailed,
not Yates rectified chi-squared test. A p value of ≤ 0.05 was
defined as statistically significant.
Figures were created using GraphPad Prism 6.
Results
Samples of a total of 31,401 patients above the age of 1 year
had been tested for anti-CMV IgG antibodies in the years
between 2009 and 2018. A total of 258 patients who had
borderline or unspecific test results were excluded, leaving
31,143 patients with an unambiguous result.
All patients after exclusion of those known to be HIV
positive
The overall CMV IgG seroprevalence in the cohort in the
decade 2009–2018, after exclusion of 1740 patients with
known HIV infection, was 56.48% (n = 29,403). The median
value in the HIV-negative population was 1400 AU/mL.
When comparing anti-CMV IgG seropositivity to the data
of the former decades, a continuous decline is visible: from
63.70% (n = 29,374) in the decade 1988–1997 and 57.27%
(n = 20,397) in the decade 1998–2008.
While the slight overall decrease from the previous to the
most recent decade (1998–2008 to 2009–2018) of 0.77% was
not statistically significant (p = 0.0881), a significant decrease
can confidently be assessed when looking at the age groups
“20 to 29,” “40 to 49,” “50 to 59,” and “60 years of age and
older,” respectively (p values < 0.0001) (Fig. 1). CMV seroprevalence throughout all age groups declined significantly
when compared with the decade 1988–1997. A sustained decrease spanning all three decades can be observed in the group
of 1 to 9 year olds, and in all age groups 40 years and older
(Fig. 1).
CMV seroprevalence by gender
The overall CMV seroprevalence in the most recent decade
2009–2018 was significantly higher in females (59.80%, n =
15,420) than in males (50.82%, n = 13,983, p < 0.0001).
During the studied period of 30 years, CMV seroprevalence
decreased in both sexes. However, from the time period of
1998–2008 to 2009–2018, there was a non-significant increase in females (p = 0.0811) (Fig. 2), and a significant decrease of 2.72% in males (p = 0.0254).
Looking at the most recent decade only, CMV seroprevalence is higher in females in all age groups, however, not
statistically significant in the age groups 1 to 9 and 10 to
19 years of age (p = 0.1046 and p = 0.2503, respectively),
while significant in all other age groups. In the group 20 to
29 years of age, there is a sharp increase in females of 10.69%
and a decline in males, resulting in a large gap between the
genders of 17.09% (39.75% in males, 56.84% in females). In
males, CMV seroprevalence increases sharply between the
age groups 20 to 29 and 30 to 39 years of age, by 10.58%.
Finally, CMV seroprevalence in both sexes merge toward a
linear increase, with seroprevalence in females about 7.5%
higher than in men (Fig. 3).

Women of childbearing age
There was no major change in the overall CMV seroprevalence of women of childbearing age presenting to the
Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics during the last
three decades. A slight increase from 64.18% (n = 3395) in
the decade 1988–1997 to 65.95% (n = 2429) in 2009–2018
cannot be asserted with confidence (p = 0.1627) (Fig. 4).
A look at the distribution between different age groups
spanning all three decades reveals the highest seroprevalence
rate in the youngest age group (16 to 20 years of age), that is
declining up to the age group 31 to 35 years of age, followed
by a continuous increase with progressing age (Fig. 5). The
decrease from 16 to 20 years of age (76.22%) to 31 to 35 years
of age (60.13%) is statistically highly significant (p < 0.0001).
CMV seroprevalence in HIV-positive patients
In our cohort, 1740 patients had a known HIV infection. Of
those, 1617 had a positive anti-CMV IgG test result; the seroprevalence was 92.93%. The median of all positive samples
was 2409 AU/mL. Compared with the data of the two previous

by gender and decade. *Data

group (Lübeck et al.) [13]

decades, we could observe an increase in seropositivity of
5.47%, which is not statistically significant (p = 0.9999).
When looking at the genders separately, the largest increase
was in females with a known HIV infection, with an increase
of 6.81% when compared with 1998–2008, and 11.44% when
compared with 1988–1997. Between the former two decades,
the increase had little confidence, since the 95% confidence
intervals overlapped. When compared with 1988–1997, however, the increase is highly significant (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 6).
A significant difference in CMV seroprevalence between
males and females with a known HIV infection had not been
observed in the decades of 1988–1997 and 1998–2008. In the
most recent decade, however, the CMV seroprevalence of
females with a known HIV infection was higher than in males

(94.61% and 92.36%, respectively), but with little confidence
(p = 0.1099).
High CMV seroprevalence in patients with a known HIV
infection could be observed in all age groups with little variation. In the analysis by sex and age in the group of patients
with a known HIV infection, the sample size was too small to
confidently identify differences.
CMV seroprevalence in oncological patients
In patients whose samples were sent in from oncological departments, we determined a combined CMV seroprevalence
of 60.64% (n = 2091). It was lower in the pediatric population,
where it was 51.60% (n = 219), and higher in the adult population (61.70%, n = 1872).
Discussion
In this study, we present an overview of the changes in CMV
IgG seroprevalence of the patients of the urban University
Hospital of Frankfurt over a time period of 30 years.
In the most recent decade (2009 to 2018), the overall CMV
seroprevalence in patients without a known HIV infection was
56.48%. This number is within the wide range of the previously published data for population groups in Europe of 30.4
to 89.7%. [9, 11, 13–19]. The slight decrease of 0.77% from
the previous decade (1998 to 2008) was not statistically significant (p = 0.0881). Therefore, the decline in overall CMV
seroprevalence in Germany, that has also been observed in
other studies [16], appears to be slowing down or even halting.
Changes in lifestyle, such as well-documented tendency toward smaller households [20] in Germany, with fewer young
children as possible sources of infection [21] during the last
decades, may have been a driver behind the decreasing trend,
which was continuously observed in the age group of 20 to
29 years of age and all groups above the age of 40 years. In our
youngest patients, below the age of 20 years, and in the age
group 30–39 years, however, the trend halted or even reversed. In the youngest patients, this might be associated with
more children below the age of 3 years attending daycare,
where the exposure to potentially infectious toddlers as a
source of infection is increased, a known factor associated
with CMV seropositivity in Germany [15]. Notably, from
2006 to 2017, the percentage of children below the age of
3 years attending day care in Germany increased from 13.6
to 33.1% [22]. Another factor offsetting the decreasing trend
in CMV prevalence might be associated with increased migration from non-EU countries, especially to the urban centers
of Germany. This could most markedly affect the age group
with the largest number of patients: 30 to 39 year olds saw an
increase of 1.28% in CMV seroprevalence (Fig. 3). Non-EU
nationals currently make up 22.08% of all 25- to 44-year olds
living in Frankfurt. Non-EU nationals living in Frankfurt
largely stem from regions with high CMV seroprevalence,
most markedly Turkey [23], where CMV seroprevalence is
reported to be between 94.9% and 96.4% in pregnant women
[19, 24]. Especially in children, migration background is well
characterized as a factor associated with a higher CMV seroprevalence [15]. It remains unclear if the overall declining
trend in CMV seroprevalence possibly continued in the subpopulation of patients without a migration background, as we
did not have information on the ethnicity of our patients.
In the most recent decade (2009–2018), women had a significantly higher CMV seroprevalence than men (59.80 versus
50.82%), a surplus of 8.98%. Other studies also observed a
higher seroprevalence in females [11, 13, 16]. Even though
this phenomenon has been observed before, it is not entirely
understood why women have a higher CMV seroprevalence.
While social factors like earlier and more extensive involvement in the care of potentially infectious toddlers and infant
might be contributing, this would not explain the higher CMV

by gender and decade of patients
with known HIV infection. *Data

group (Lübeck et al) [13]

seroprevalence in females of all age groups. A sharp increase
in CMV seroprevalence occurs in females between the age
groups 10 to 19 and 20 to 29 years of age, and in males
between the age groups 20 to 29 and 30 to 39 years of age
(Fig. 4). The delayed increase in men, as well as the higher
overall prevalence in women after puberty, might be attributed
to CMV, like other sexually transmitted infections, being sexually transmitted at a higher rate from infectious men to susceptible women than from infectious women to susceptible
men [25].
In women of childbearing age presenting to the Department of
Obstetrics and Gynecology, we observed a CMV seroprevalence
of 65.95%, which is significantly higher than the overall rate of
59.80%. There was no significant change during the last 30 years
(Fig. 4). Other studies in women of childbearing age in Germany
reported lower rates in pregnant women, ranging from 34% in a
small group of 34 pregnant women from all over Germany [11]
to 46–52%, with data from a central German University Hospital
[11, 18]. Stratified by age group and spanning over three decades,
we could see the highest CMV seroprevalence in young women
(76.22% in the age group 16 to 20 years of age) that was declining up to the group 31 to 35 years of age. This phenomenon has
previously been observed in studies from 1991 (Friese et al.) and
2011 (Enders et al.) [16, 17], and might be due to women with
lower socioeconomic status [26] as well as women with migration background from non-EU countries [27] tending to give
birth to their first child earlier in life, both factors associated with
higher CMV prevalence [16, 18, 28]. In the following age
groups, CMV seroprevalence rises continuously (Fig. 4).
In patients with a known HIV infection, a further increase
in the already high CMV seroprevalence could be observed,
most strikingly in women, who had a CMV seroprevalence of
94.61%, an increase of 6.81% when compared with the former
decade. In males, CMV seroprevalence also increased, but not
quite as much, and was 92.36%. Especially in women with a
known HIV infection, this trend might be associated with
migration from Sub-Saharan Africa after 2013 [29], where
CMV seropositivity in asymptomatic, HIV-positive patients
approaches 100% [10]. It is noteworthy that the median value
of all positive samples was higher in the group of patients that
are known to be HIV positive, with a value of 2409 AU/mL,
as compared with 1400 AU/mL in the HIV-negative group. It
needs to be taken into account that this does not represent the
mathematical mean, which could not be calculated due to a
recorded upper limit in the AU/mL value, and it is unclear if
this less than twofold difference represents a clinically relevant gap. In patients that could be identified as oncological, a
CMV seroprevalence of 60.64% (n = 2091) was determined in
the current decade. In pediatric patients, it was 51.60%, and
61.70% in adult patients. The excess from the overall seroprevalence of 56.48% in the HIV-negative cohort is statistically significant (p = 0.0002), but there are no numbers available in the literature to which we could compare this result of
all combined oncological patients. The main goal of this study
was the description of changes in CMV seroprevalence over
time. In the case of oncological patients, however, we cannot
compare this number to the previous decades, as the structures
of our University Hospital as well as the data accompanying
the samples has changed in the last 30 years, and no congruent
groups could be defined. Patients could also not be divided
into further subgroups of interest, such as solid organ or stem
cell recipients, since such data was not easily attained. This is
an area that should be further examined in future studies.
Other limitations of our study include our hospital cohort
setting in an urban region of Germany, which is not representative of the general population. We also cannot be sure that
the sent-in practices for CMVassays in our university hospital
did not change during the examined period of 30 years, and
influenced the comparability of the studies. During the last
three decades, there was an increased awareness of the dangers of primary CMV infection during pregnancy, and therefore, more testing occurred in pregnant women, distorting the
overall numbers by over-representing this group.
The strength of this study lies in the large number of patients (31,401 in the decade 2009–2018), and the good comparability of the test results, as the same diagnostic test had
been applied over the last three decades.
Overall, the former significant decline of CMV seroprevalence between the decades 1988–1997 and 1998–2008 in this
urban region of Germany slowed down to a non-significant
decrease of 0.77% (1998–2008 vs. 2009–2018). This might
be an indicator that the dynamic of the CMV seroprevalence
has reached a plateau. It remains unclear whether the herein
described changes in CMV immunity over time have a tangible impact on the incidence of CMV disease in groups at risk.
In women of childbearing age, there was no significant change
in CMV seropositivity in the last three decades, and therefore,
no change in the proportion of women who are at risk of
primary CMV infection during pregnancy.
