Abstract
Background Primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) is a multisystemic metabolic disorder caused by an excessive production of
oxalate by the liver. The majority of patients presenting in early infancy have end-stage renal disease (ESRD). While awaiting the
results of sRNAi trials, the current standard treatment is combined liver-kidney transplantation. Recently, Stiripentol has been
reported as a promising drug in the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria by reducing urinary oxalate (UOx). Stiripentol is an anticonvulsive drug used in the treatment of children suffering from Dravet syndrome. It causes blockage of the last step in oxalate
production by inhibition of hepatic lactate dehydrogenase 5 (LDH5).
Case We administered Stiripentol as compassionate use in an anuric infant with dialysis-dependent PH1 over a period of
4 months. Although achieving plasma concentrations of Stiripentol that were recently reported to lower UOx excretion, we did
not observe significant reduction to plasma oxalate concentrations (POx).
Conclusion We conclude that Stiripentol may not be useful to reduce POx in PH patients with advanced chronic kidney disease
(CKD), but larger studies are needed to confirm this finding.

Background
Primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) is one of the three genetically classified forms of inherited primary hyperoxalurias [1]. All
forms belong to the group of rare metabolic diseases. PH1 is
caused by homo- or compound heterozygous mutations in the
gene which codes for the hepatic peroxisomal enzyme alanineglyoxylate aminotransferase (AGXT). As a consequence of a
mal- or non-functioning enzyme alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT), its substrate, glyoxylate, cannot be converted into
glycine but is converted via the enzymes glycolate oxidase (GO)
as well as LDH5 into oxalate [1]. The excessive production of
oxalate causes deposits particularly in the calcium-oxalate form
in the kidney and leads to a mechanical but also inflammatory
kidney injury followed by a decrease of glomerular filtration rate
(GFR) and progression to ESRD [1, 2]. In the absence of sufficient oxalate excretion by the continuously decreasing kidney
function, oxalate accumulates with rising concentrations of plasma oxalate, and crossing the saturation threshold crystalizes
throughout the body, e.g., the bone, vessel walls, skin, heart,
retina, bone marrow, and central nervous system (systemic
oxalosis) [3]. Systemic oxalosis leads to progressive severe illness and death. Vitamin B6 acts as a co-factor of AGT, and
therapy with vitamin B6 leads to reduction of endogenous oxalate production in some patients with residual AGT activity. The
current standard of PH1 treatment is, except for the vitamin B6-
dependent forms, a combined liver and kidney transplantation,
either simultaneously or sequentially [4]. As this procedure confers many short- and long-term risks (5-year survival rate is
76%), there is urgent need for alternative, less invasive therapies
[5]. Novel approaches of substrate-reduction therapies by RNA
interference (RNAi) technology are in development [6].
However, data on the effectiveness of RNAi therapy in patients
with advanced kidney disease is not expected until the end of

2020 [7]. Metabolic effects of RNA interference that targets
hepatic LDH5 needs further investigation [8].
Stiripentol, a well-known anticonvulsive drug, has been
shown to inhibit lactate dehydrogenase 5 isoenzyme
(LDH5), targeting glyoxylate transformation. In 2019, Le
Dudal and colleagues described (a) the successful use of
Stiripentol to lower UOx excretion in cell cultures and an animal model of oxalate nephropathy, (b) lower UOx excretion in
patients treated with Stiripentol for Dravet syndrome, and (c)
decreased UOx excretion in a PH1 patient with preserved kidney function [9]. With respect to these promising results, we
administered Stiripentol in a PH1 patient with ESRD over a
period of 4 months and report the results here.
Case report
A 17-month-old male boy of northern African origin presented to our hospital. At that time, he was in established renal
failure, having been commenced on peritoneal dialysis (PD) at
the age of 9 months in his home country. Diagnosis of PH1
has been confirmed within the first year of life by genetic
analysis revealing a homozygous mutation in the AGXT gene
(Ile244Thr). We measured free plasma oxalate (POx) concentrations following a protocol previously established in our
laboratory. Using this protocol, POx concentrations between
20 and 40 μmol/L are commonly obtained in general ESRD
patients [10]. In our patient, POx concentration was
128.9 μmol/L at presentation. In the further course, samples
for control of POx concentration were taken after nocturnal
peritoneal dialysis and pre-hemodialysis. The patient demonstrated slight pancytopenia, but no signs of retinopathy, echocardiography, and Speckle tracking echocardiography were
unremarkable. He was initially anuric, and during the course
of his hospitalization, urine output slightly improved (less
than 0.1 ml/kg BW/h). The patient had already received pyridoxine (9 mg/kg BW per day) for several months prior to
admission as responsiveness to this medication has been described in patients with the Ile244Thr genotype [1]. As his PD
program has been insufficient to effectively lower POx concentration, we first introduced a daily program (10 dwells of
80 min with 300 mL each, Glc 1.5%; Ca2+ 1.25%) according
to GPN standard. In addition to PD, we placed a tunneled
catheter via the right vena jugularis interna and started our
patient on continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration
(CVVHDF, 5 sessions of 2–3 h per week; dialysate flow 5-
7 L/h; blood flow 50–60 mL/min). Following initiation of this
regimen, POx concentration dropped to 80.8 μmol/L (Fig. 1).
For the compassionate use of Stiripentol, the parents gave
written informed consent. Subsequently, Stiripentol was introduced with a starting dosage of 4.7 mg/kg/d and increased
stepwise up to 61 mg/kg/d for the duration of 2 months. At
the end of the trial, we administered a dosage slightly above
the recommended dosage; however, Stiripentol plasma measurements by high-performance liquid chromatography
showed values within a non-toxic range. The manufacturer’s
recommendations were followed specifically concerning dietary precautions. Most frequent side effects (≥ 1/100) of
Stiripentol are loss of appetite and weight, dizziness, insomnia, irritability, hyperkinesia, nausea and vomiting, elevated
GGT, and neutropenia. Adverse reactions were not observed
in our patient. During the whole 3.5-month period of
Stiripentol administration, we did not observe a decrease in
POx concentration and, therefore, stopped administration.
Four weeks after discontinuation, POx concentrations were
found to remain within the same range, suggesting that the
withdrawal did not increase oxalate load further.
Conclusion
PH1 is a rare life-threatening disorder. With the exception of
responsiveness to pyridoxine, mostly in patients with the
Gly170Arg and Phe152Ile mutations, and its mediated effects

like protein stability, catalytic activity, and peroxisomal transport, there is no drug known to improve or even to stabilize
this condition. Also, association between age at onset and
mutation is of high intrafamilial phenotypic heterogeneity [3].
Stiripentol has recently been reported as being effective in a
PH1 cell culture model and in patients suffering from Dravet
syndrome and PH1 [9]. Despite administering a dosage that is
comparable with that administered to Dravet patients and the
patient reported by Le Dudal et al., we were not able to demonstrate lowering of POx concentrations. In contrast to the
patient reported in the literature, our patient suffered from
more advanced disease when Stiripentol administration was
initiated. Stiripentol dosage and plasma concentrations were
within the reference ranges [11]. Therefore, there are different
considerations to explain our findings: the effect of Stiripentol
on the reduction of POx concentration might be less powerful
than expected and might only be detectable in patients with
mild courses of PH1. Alternatively, the inhibition of LDH 5
by Stiripentol might be depending on eGFR, so only patients
with preserved kidney function in the early course of disease
might benefit from its therapy.
Our findings provide evidence that Stiripentol is not useful
in our patient; however, larger studies have been initiated to
demonstrate the efficacy of Stiripentol in patients suffering
from PH [12]. In contrast to options of GO inhibiting therapy
for PH1 patients, blockage of the last step of oxalate production by inhibition of LDH5 could also be of therapeutic value
for patients with PH2 or PH3. It is necessary to establish if
Stiripentol is capable of lowering POx concentrations consistently in PH patients and if this relates to the level of renal
dysfunction. Moreover, Stiripentol may need to be compared
with other RNA interference substrate-reduction therapies to
demonstrate whether it achieves sufficient inhibition of LDH5
to substantially reduce POx generation in PH1 patients in the
different stages of CKD.
