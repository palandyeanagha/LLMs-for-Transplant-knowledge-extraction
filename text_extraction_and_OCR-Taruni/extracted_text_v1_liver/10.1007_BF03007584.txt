Perioperative stroke 
Part II: Cardiac surgery 
and cardiogenic 
embolic stroke 
The major mechanism of stroke in cardiac surgery, is embolization. The risk is higher in intracardiac than in extracardiac 
surgery. The incidence of stoke associated with CABG is about 
5%. The cerebral protective properties of isoflurane and 
thiopentone, acid-base management, and monitoring of cerebral perfusion during cardiopuhnonary bypass are discussed. 
Prophylactic carotid endarterectomy Jbr patients with asymptomatic carotid disease before cardiac surgery is not necessary. 
Symptomatic carotid disease increases the risk of stroke, and the 
management of patients who have both symptomatic coronar), 
and carotid artery diseases is discussed. Cardiogeaic embolism 
is probably responsible for many perioperative strokes. Patients 
with atrial fibrillation, valvular disease, and prosthetic heart 
valves are at high risk of cardiogenic embolism. Strokes 
associated with cardioversion, pacemaker insertion, coronary 
arteriography and angioplas~, are explored.

Cardiac surgery 
Stroke associated with cardiopulmonary bypass 
The incidence of neurological injury in patients undergoing cardiac surgery varies with the methods of evaluation. These may be based on clinical examination, 
neuropsychological testing, biochemical variables or 
EEG. The incidence of abnormalities tends to be underestimated in retrospective chart reviews,~ and in studies 
performed by non-neurologists. 2 
Because of an increased risk of embolization, neurological complications are more frequent following intracardiac surgery such as valve replacement than following 
extracardiac procedures such as coronary artery bypass. 
Earlier studies reported persistent neurological deficits in 
more than 15% of patients following intracardiac surgery. 3-s In a survey of 1689 consecutive patients who 
underwent isolated aortic valve replacement at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation from 1972 through 1989, stroke 
occurred in 29 patients (I.7%). 6 In 1980 Sotaniemi's 
prospective study of I00 patients undergoing valve 
replacement surgery showed a 37% incidence of postoperative deficit, but only 7% had a persistent severe 
deficit. 7 
Most retrospective studies of coronary artery bypass 
surgery show a low neurological complication rate. Lee et 
al. reported an occurrence of cerebral infarction in 0.7% 
of 943 patients. 8 In Gonzaalez-Scarano and Hurtig's 
series of 1427 patients, there were 19 (I.3%) who 
developed postoperative neurological complications. 9 
Martin and Hashimoto reported postoperative stroke in 
eight patients among 253 (3.7%). to In a series of 3206 
patients reported by Boiar et al., there were 32 (I %) who 
developed major neurological deficits, t t Coffey et al. 
reported 63 of 1669 patients (3.8%) developed postoperative neurological complications such as altered mental 
state, stroke or seizure. 12 On the other hand, prospective 
studies revealed a higher incidence of stroke. In the 
prospective study of Shaw et al. neurological complications occurred in 191 oftheir 312 patients (61%), and 15 
patients (4.8%) suffered a stroke. ~3 Similarly, Breuer et 
al.'s prospective study or 421 patients revealed 22 (5.2%) 
postoperative strokes. 14 Thus the current incidence of 
perioperative stroke associated with cardiac surgery is 
about 5% (Table 1). 
Following cardiac transplantation, 50 to 60% of patients developed neurological complications. IS't6 Cerebral infarcts were present in 20% of cases in autopsy series 
and in 13 to 15% in clinical series,IS't7 and were primarily 
due to embolism. Intracerebral haemorrhage occurred in 
5% of early transplants, and were probably due to relative 
cerebral hyperperfusion from abrupt increases in blood 
pressure and cerebral blood flow in the presence of a 
disordered cerebral autoregulatory response, i8 
Mechanism of intraoperative neurological injur), 
Neurological damage may result from inadequate cerebral 
perfusion or embolization. The primary mechanism causing focal ischaemia and infarction associated with cardiac 
surgery is embolization. 
SURGICAL FACTORS 
Gaseous or particulate emboli may be introduced into the 
arterial circulation during surgery, especially when the 
heart or aorta are opened. Embolic phenomena are more 
common in intracardiac surgery than in closed cardiac 
procedures, t9 Gaseous microemboli can be detected in 
the majority of cases by using an ultrasonic microbubble 
detector 2~ or oesophageal M-mode echocardiography.2 t 
Surgical manoeuvres such as detection and removal of 
intracardiac air, filling the heart with fluid before 
unclamping the aorta greatly reduces gaseous microembolism. 22-25 Lowering the head ~6 and digital compression of the carotid arteries 27 may prevent emboli from 
entering the cerebral circulation when the heart begins to 
eject at the time of coming off cardiopulmonary bypass. 
Avoidance of nitrous oxide may help to minimize the 
potential exacerbation of neurological injury. 28 
Calcification and atheroma of the ascending aorta 29'3~ 
and thrombi in the left ventricle 3t are important sources of 
emboli. It has been suggested that, in patients with severe 
calcific disease of the aorta, femoral artery cannulation is 
preferable to aortic cannulation to avoid aortic manipulation. 32 
CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS 
Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) may introduce a wide 
variety of material, including air, fat, antifoaming agents, 
plastic chips, leukocytes, platelets and fibrin aggregates,

Proper priming procedures can reduce foreign particles

solid and gaseous microparticles and reducing the number 
of microemboli delivered to the arterial circulation. Some

Intraoperative management 
PROTECTIVE EFFECT OF ANAESTHETIC AGENTS 
Many animal and clinical studies have attempted to 
examine if isoflurane provides cerebral protection against 
ischaemia (Table ll). 

474 CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA 
Newberg and Michenfelder reported that the survival 
time of severely hypoxaemic mice was increased when 
they were exposed to 1.0% and 1.4% isoflurane. 48 In 
normocarbic mechanically ventilated cats, isoflurane at 
0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 MAC,caused nochanges in CBF, greater 
decreases in CMRO2, and less impairment of autoregulation than comparable MACs of halothane. 49 Baughman et 
al. found that, in rats with incomplete cerebral ischaemia 
produced by carotid artery occlusion, combined with 
haemorrhagic hypotension, isoflurane and halothane both 
provided better neurological and histological outcomes 
than N20 controls. 5~ In dogs, a dose-related decrease in 
cerebral oxygen consumption (CMRO2) was evident until 
the onset of isoelectric EEG, which occurred at an 
isoflurane end-expired concentration of 3%. Further 
increases of the isoflurane concentration did not produce 
any more reduction of the CMRO2. The normal concentrations of ATP and phosphocreatine in the brain biopsies 
suggested that this concentration of isoflurane had no 
direct toxic effect on the cerebral metabolic pathways. 5~ 
Nehls et al., however, in a focal ischaemia model using 
transorbital middle cerebral artery occlusion in baboons, 
could not demonstrate any protective value of isoflurane 
in concentrations sufficient to maintain burst suppression 
on the EEG, when compared with thiopental. 52 One 
possible explanation for the apparent negative effects was 
that isoflurane, in contrast to the cerebral vasoconstricting 
properties of thiopentone, was a mild cerebral vasodilator 
and could cause an unfavourable redistribution of blood 
flow during regional ischaemia. Furthermore, Young et 
al. showed that although the CBF was greater during 
halothane than during isoflurane or fentanyl anaesthesia 
in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy, there was 
no demonstrable difference in the CMRO2 between the 
three anaesthetic agents. 53 
The cerebral effects of isoflurane during hypotension 
have also been studied. The cerebral energy stores of ATP 
and phosphocreatine, and the cerebral energy charge in 
dogs, during a nine-minute haemorrhagic hypotension to 
30 mmHg, were sustained at much higher levels when 
exposed to 3% isoflurane than N20 controls. 48 Normal 
aerobic metabolism was preserved in association with 
decreases in both the CBF and the CMRO-, during 
isoflurane-induced hypotension in dogs. $4 During isoflurane-induced hypotension to a mean arterial pressure of 
50 mmHg in patients undergoing craniotomy for clipping 
of cerebral aneurysms, Newman et al. found that the 
CMRO2 was reduced while the mean CBF remained 
relatively unchanged, indicating that the global oxygen 
supply-demand balance was favourably influenced by 
isoflurane. 5-s Artru found no adverse effect on cerebral 
metabolism and the EEG during hypocapnia (to PaCO2 of 
20 mmHg) plus isoflurane-induced hypotension (cerebral 
perfusion pressure to as low as 40 mmHg for 30 minutes) 
in dogs. 56 Mutch et al. showed that during isoflurane 
anaesthesia (at inspired 1.5 MAC) in rats subjected to 
haemorrhagic hypotension, phenylephrine infusion did 
not cause cerebral vasoconstriction and effectively maintained both total and regional CBF. 57 Ruta and Mutch 
found that, in rabbits, isoflurane-induced hypotension to a 
mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 50 mmHg (the lower 
limit of the autoregulatory range) produced regional 
differences in cerebral perfusion, with decreased rCBF to 
the supratentorial structures, increased rCBF to the 
cerebellum and the brain stem, and unchanged total CBF 
(tCBF). The rCBF to all regions of the brain became 
pressure passive, as expected, when MAP was further 
decreased to 30 mmHg by haemorrhage. Raising the 
MAP back to 50 mmHg by a reduction of the inspired 
isoflurane concentration, restoration of blood volume, or 
infusion of phenylephrine was effective in improving the 
tCBF and the rCBF to the supratentorial structures. 
However, reduction of the inspired isoflurane concentration did not improve the rCBF to the posterior fossa 
structures. Nevertheless, the rCBF to these structures at 
this time was not different from that before hypotension 
was induced with isoflurane. The rCBF autoregulation 
curve was shifted downward and to the right in the 
infratentorial structures. 58 
Messick et al., in a study on isoflurane anaesthesia for 
carotid endarterectomy, found that the level of r'CBF 
below which EEG signs of ischaemia occurred (critical 
rCBF) was < 10 ml" I00 g-~ 9 rain -I, much lower than that 
previously reported for halothane (18-20 ml. 100 g-t. 
min-I).59 This lower value of critical rCBF for isoflurane 
was also found by Michenfelder et al. in their retrospective review of 2010 carotid endarterectomies in which 
both EEG and CBF were measured. 6~ 
It appears that isoflurane is the preferred volatile 
anaesthetic for protection against cerebral ischaemia. The 
mechanism of cerebral protection is similar to that of the 
barbiturates, and is mainly by a reduction in CMRO~ 
through a depression of synaptic transmission. The 
reduction in CMRO2 is maximum when the EEG becomes 
isoelectric. A high inspiratory concentration of isoflurane 
(2.5 to 3.5%) is required to induce EEG burst suppression. Woodcock et al. compared the cerebral haemodynamic and metabolic effects of isoflurane and thiopentone 
EEG suppression during CPB. The thiopentone-induced 
EEG suppression was associated with a reduction of both 
the CMRO2 and the CBF. However, although isofluraneinduced EEG suppression reduced the CMRO2, it was not 
associated with a reduction of CBF. 6~ The authors 
suggested that the thiopentone-induced reduction in CBF 

Wong: PERIOPERATIVE STROKE 475 
would produce a proportionate reduction in the delivery of 
emboli to the cerebral circulation. In addition, the 
cerebral vasoconstriclive properties of thiopentone may 
induce a more favourable redistribution of CBF towards 
an ischaemic focus. 
Isoflurane may produce myocardial ischaemia by 
inducing coronary steal. The studies by Slogoff et al. and 
Tuman et al., however, did not show deleterious effects 
of isoflurane in CABG. 6L63 On the other hand, lnoue et 
al. showed that isoflurane produced significantly worse 
outcomes than enflurane when used in CABG, with 
higher postoperative myocardial infarction (4.0% vs 
1.8%) and higher in-hospital deaths (2.1% vs 0.3%). 
Cardioplegic solutions were not used for myocardial 
protection, and the volatile agent was used as the primary 
anaesthetic during CPB in this series. 64 
Barbiturates in high doses suppress neuronal electrical 
activity and reduce cerebral metabolic demands. The 
reduction of cerebral metabolism is maximal when the 
EEG becomes isoelectric, at which level the membrane 
ion pumps remain intact. 65-67 Barbiturates, in sufficient 
dosage to cause electrical silence in nonischaemic brain, 
may divert flow to ischaemic areas. 68 However, to 
provide cerebral protection, they must be given either 
before or soon after an insult, and the protection is 
effective in temporary, ralher than permanent, focal 
ischaemia. 69 Nussmeier et al., in a prospective randomized study of open-ventricle operations requiring CPB, 
found that thiopentone, given in sufficient doses to 
maintain electroencephalographic silence for the duration 
of bypass, reduced the neuropsychiatric dysfunction of 
cerebral embolism associated with open heart operations. 
The neuropsychiatric dysfunction, which included hemiparesis, homonymous hemianopsia, dysarthria, disorientation, memory loss, excessive lethargy, hallucinations, 
delusions and hostility, occurred in 5.6% of 89 patients 
treated with lhiopentone, and in 8.6% of 93 patients not 
treated. By the tenth postoperative day, all neuropsychiatric abnormalities disappeared in the thiopentonetreated patients, but persisted in 7.5% of patients in the 
untreated group. 7~ The authors recommended this therapy 
for patients undergoing valve replacement, resection of 
ventricular aneurysms, and other operations requiring 
opening of the ventricle. However, barbiturates in such 
doses may create additional problems of cardiovascular 
instability and prolonged emergence from anaesthesia. 
HYPOTHERMIA, HAEMODILUTION AND ACID-BASE 
MANAGEMENT 
Mild hypothermia (28 to 30~ and haemodilution (20 to 
30%) are used routinely during CPB. Hypothermia 
reduces cerebral requirements for oxygen and glucose 
and, theoretically, may confer protection in cerebral 
ischaemia. 7~'72 As hypothermia increases blood viscosity, haemodilution is used during bypass to minimize 
driving pressures required to maintain flow. 73 
While we generally agree that the normal arterial pH 
and PCO2 values at 37" C are 7.4 and 40 mmHg 
respectively, the values at lower body temperatures that 
we consider to be ideal are not clear. The solubility of CO2 
in blood increases as temperature decreases, such that 
PCO2 decreases and pH increases. Results from blood gas 
analysis corrected to the patient's temperature will indicate respiratory alkalosis. Whether we should use values 
temperature-corrected to actual body temperature or 
uncorrected at the measuring electrode's temperature is 
controversial. 
Some believe that it is desirable to maintain a normal 
acid-base relationship, and adjust the pH to 7.4, and 
PCO2 to 40 mmHg, irrespective of the temperature. TM 
This is the "pH-stat" approach. It is often necessary to add 
CO2 to the oxygenator to achieve these values during 
hypothermic CPB. These values would correspond to 
hypercapnia and acidosis at the electrode temperature. 
The temperature chosen for correction is inconsistent, and 
may be nasopharyngeal, oesophageal, tympanic, bladder 
or that of the perfusate. Over- or under-correction often 
results as temperature gradients exist between tissues 
during cooling and rewarming. 
Cold-blooded animals behave quite differently from 
this in a cold environment. As their body temperature 
falls, their arterial PCO2 decreases and pH increases, and 
the content of CO2 remains constant. The pH of their 
arterial blood is maintained at 7.4 when measured with a 
37 ~ C electrode without temperalure correction. The 
charge state of the imidazole radical of histidine (the alpha 
charge), upon which many enzymatic and transport 
activities are dependent, is influenced by the arterial 
PCO2. Maintenance of a constant alpha charge allows the 
cold-blooded animal to survive at low temperatures in an 
active state. 75 The "alpha-slat" approach imitates the 
cold-blooded animals, maintaining uncorrected values at 
normal ranges. As the pH of neutrality (where H § = 
OH-) increases when temperature decreases, this approach maintains electrochemical neutrality. 
McConnell et al. showed that, in dogs undergoing 
hypothermic CPB at 28 ~ C, an increase of the arterial pH 
from 7.40 to 7.70 produced an increase in coronary blood 
flow and myocardial lactate utilization with an improvement of the left ventricular performance. 76 Ohmura et al. 
found that, in dogs subjected to surface-induced hypothermia to 24 ~ C, maintaining normocarbia by the 
addition of CO2 caused a rapid decrease in the cardiac 
index and an increase in both pulmonary and systemic 

476 CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA 
vascular resistances. 77 The alpha-star approach thus 
appears to be more beneficial to the cardiovascular system 
than the pH-stat approach, 
However, the cerebral circulation is a concern here. 
Since both hypothermia and low PCO2 decrease CBF, 
cerebral ischaemia is a potential problem with the 
alpha-stat approach. Differences in the anaesthetic techniques and the methods of CBF measurements resulted in 
conflicting data regarding the effect of COz on CBF 
during hypothermic CPB. Henriksen et al. reported that, 
in patients anaesthetized with enflurane during the prebypass period, hypothermic CPB was associated with an 
increase in CBF and impairment of CO~ responsivehess. 78 Govier et al., on the other hand, using diazepam 
and fentanyl, found that CBF decreased during hypothermic CPB, and the responsiveness of the CBF to changes in 
PaCO2 was maintained. 79 Prough et al. also found that 
CBF remained responsive to changes in PaCO2 during 
hypothermic, nonpulsatile CPB in patients anaesthetized 
with high-dose fentanyl. 8~ H~igerdal et al. found that, in 
rats, although the CBF decreased with decreasing PaCO2 
during hypothermia, there was no evidence of tissue 
hypoxia, as the CMRO2 decreased with hypothermia, st 
Murkin et al. found that, during hypothermic CPB in 
patients anaesthetized with fentanyl and diazepam, the 
cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO2) was reduced. In patients managed with the pH-stat approach 
(temperature-corrected), the CBF was higher, and was 
independent of CMRO2, but correlated with cerebral 
perfusion pressure (CPP). This led to hyperperfusion 
relative to the cerebral oxygen demand. On the other 
hand, in patients managed with the alpha-stat approach 
(non-temperature-corrected), the CBF was lower, and 
correlated well with CMRO2, but not with CPP. s2 The 
fact that most centres use temperature-corrected CO2 for 
acid-base management suggests that the particular 
method of acid-base management may not be crucial. 82 
However, any unnecessary increase in CBF may increase 
the delivery of micro-emboli to the cerebral circulation. 
Furthermore, unnecessary elevations of PaCO~ may lead 
to intracerebral steal phenomenon in patients with cerebrovascular disease. It remains to be seen if clinical data 
can substantiate these theoretical concerns. 
CEREBRAL PERFUSION 
Pulsatile perfusion techniques offer theoretical advantages such as better distribution of myocardial perfusion, 
capillary perfusion, urine output, and preservation of 
normal pituitary-adrenal stress-response. 83-91 However, 
they have the disadvantage of creating increased turbulence of blood flow and thus increased haemolysis. No 
study has yet shown that pulsatile perfusion can improve 
neurological outcome in cardiac surgery. The safety and 
simplicity of the nonocclusive roller nonpulsatile pump 
make it the most widely used system. 
The limits of hypotension that can be tolerated during 
CPB without neurological injury have not been precisely 
defined. While early studies showed an increased incidence of neurological damage when the mean arterial 
pressure decreased below 50 mmHg, 5'92-9s the association has not been confirmed subsequently. 7'9'19'96 It 
appears that, when alpha-star acid-base management is 
used, cerebral perfusion is well maintained at a decreased 
systemic flow and pressure during CPB.79'8~ Nevertheless, maintenance of adequate flow and pressure can 
minimize the autoregulatory cerebral vasodilatation associated with marginal cerebral perfusion pressures. Following an unavoidable hypotensive episode, an even 
higher cerebral perfusion pressure is required to overcome 
the no-reflow phenomenon. 94'97-10o 
MONITORING OF CEREBRAL PERFUSION 
Since perioperative stroke occurs in about 5% of patients 
undergoing CABG and CPB, monitoring techniques 
capable of early detection of potentially reversible problems would be most useful. The EEG has helped to 
identify inadequate cerebral perfusion during carotid 
surgery, and it is logical to extend its use in cardiac 
surgery. 
Witoszka et al., in a retrospective study, found no 
relationship between the intraoperative EEG abnormalities and the outcome of a selected group of patients 
(consisting of five intraoperative deaths, 45 postoperative 
deaths, and 50 survivors) who had cardiac surgery and 
CPB. They concluded that localizing neurological deficits 
were likely related to embolism, and were not detectable 
by the EEG. I~ Salerno et al., in a prospective study of 
the value of EEG monitoring during CABG and valve 
replacement in 1 18 patients, found EEG abnormalities in 
22 patients (I 8.6%). Most ofthese were transient, but five 
patients showed severe EEG suppression, which led to the 
correction of technical problems and subsequent return of 
normal EEG, and no neurological damage. However, two 
patients who had normal intraoperative EEG developed 
postoperative cerebral infarction. They had severe calcific aortic stenosis. The deficit was either missed by the 
EEG, or developed postoperatively, to2 
Computer-processed EEG monitors can make the 
interpretation much easier than with conventional EEG. 
Many models have been evaluated for use during cardiac 
surgery and CPB. In 1973, Schwartz et al. compared 
retrospectively the neurological outcome of 100 patients 
undergoing cardiac surgery, with the information obtained from the Cerebral Function Monitor (CFM, Devices Ltd.), which produced a filtered and compressed 
EEG signal as a single trace from a pair of parietal 

Wong: PERIOPERATIVE STROKE 477 
electrodes. It was possible to predict correctly the 
neurological outcome in 83% of the patients by simple 
quantification of the CFM trace alone. ~o3 The Cerebral 
Function Analysing Monitor (CFAM), which analyzed 
both the amplitude and the frequency of the EEG as 
recorded from biparietal electrodes, was evaluated by 
Nevin et al. in a prospective study on 65 patients 
undergoing CABG. Unexplained acute changes in both 
amplitude and frequency distribution (such as sudden 
reduction in amplitude and frequency, or opening up of 
the amplitude envelope together with slowing) lasting 
more than three minutes were considered to be significant 
CFAM changes. These occurred at various times throughout the operation, although mostly at the beginning of 
bypass. All patients with two or more CFAM changes 
during the course of their operation were found to have 
significant postoperative neuropsychometric deficits. 
However, 21% false positive results were seen. io4 EI-Fiki 
and Fish reported the detection of two ischaemic episodes 
in a patient undergoing myomectomy for idiopathic 
hypertrophic subaortic stenosis, using a two-channel 
Cerebro Trac 2500 EEG Monitor (SRD, Peekskill, NY) 
which displayed the power/frequency spectrum in DSA 
and spectral edge frequency set at 95%. An accidental 
pump disconnection led to an almost total loss of the EEG 
activity within ten seconds. The EEG recovered in four 
minutes after perfusion was restored. Air embolization 
occurred during manipulation of the heart to remove air 
from the left ventricle. This was associated with severe 
and prolonged EEG changes. Thiopental infusion was 
given for protection. The patient recovered with only 
minimal neurological deficits. 1~ Jones and Scheller 
reported a case of unexpected interruption in CPB which 
resulted in profound EEG changes easily detected with a 
Lifescan processed EEG monitor (Neurometrics, San 
Diego, CA) in a patient undergoing mitral valve replacement and CABG. The change in the EEG spectral edge 
(95%) was easily seen, and returned to normal when 
perfusion was restored.I~ 
The EEG is used to provide warning of decreases in the 
cerebral perfusion to marginal levels as evidenced by a 
decrease in the frequency and amplitude of electrical 
activity. However, EEG changes are commonly seen at 
the onset of CPB. ,04, io5 Slowing of the EEG may also be 
caused by hypothermia 1~ or high-dose narcotic anaesthesia, ~os, Io9 both of which are commonly used in cardiac 
surgery. In addition, roller-pumps often produce EEG 
artifacts, t~o The development of permanent neurological 
damage depends on both the severity and the duration of 
ischaemia, and therefore not all ischaemic EEG changes 
are associated with postoperative morbidity. Furthermore, strokes caused by small emboli may not be detected 
by EEG monitoring. For these reasons, routine use of 
EEG monitoring during cardiac surgery has not been 
shown to reduce neurological morbidity, except in the 
presence of unexpected events, tos,lo6 On the other hand, 
the EEG may be useful in detecting unexpected cerebral 
hypoperfusion in patients with cerebrovascular disease. ~11 
However, von Reutern et al., using transcranial Doppler 
ultrasonography, could not demonstrate any significant 
reduction of blood flow in the middle cerebral artery on 
the side of a severe (>80%) carotid obstruction during 
CPB. The authors concluded that carotid obstruction 
could not be considered a significant risk factor for the 
development of intraoperative stroke, t~2 
Cardiac surgical patients with carotid artery disease 
The natural histories of carotid and coronary artery 
atherosclerosis are closely related. Indeed, transient 
ischaemic attacks should be looked upon as a warning for 
cardiac as well as cerebrovascular disease, t t3 The risk of 
stroke associated with coronary artery revascularization is 
increased in patients with symptomatic carotid artery 
disease, i t4 On the other hand, myocardial infarction is a 
major cause of morbidity and mortality associated with 
carotid endarterectomy. ~15-iis 
ASYMPTOMATIC BRUIT OR CAROTID STENOSIS 
Central nervous system complications are more common 
and more severe after CABG surgery than after peripheral 
vascular surgery. 119 Does the presence of asymptomatic 
bruit or asymptomatic carotid stenosis increase the risk of 
perioperative stroke during cardiac surgery using CPB? 
Reed and associates compared 54 patients who developed stroke or transient ischaemic attacks following 
coronary artery bypass surgery, with 54 randomly selected patients who also had the same operation but had no 
neurological complications. The number of patients with 
bruits was small. Nonetheless, their analysis showed that 
the presence of a preoperative carotid bruit increased the 
risk of stroke or TIAs by a factor of 3.9. Their study was 
not specifically directed to asymptomatic bruits, and the 
postoperative deficits observed were not necessarily 
related to the side of carotid bruit. 12o 
Since cervical bruits are not exclusively due to carotid 
artery disease, noninvasive evaluation of the carotid 
system should be performed. Using OPG or Doppler 
techniques, haemodynamically important carotid stenosis 
can be found in about 20% of patients with asymptomatic 
bruits. ~21-1z3 Barnes et al. found no significant difference in the perioperative stroke rate between patients with 
Doppler-documented significant carotid obstruction 
(2.5%) and those who had normal or minor lesions in the 
carotid arteries (I.8%). t22 Ivey et al., in their study of 
1433 patients undergoing CPB, found no case of stroke in 
the 82 patients who had asymptomatic bruits, 66 of which

Furlan and Craciun studied the risk of stroke associated 
with CABG surgery in 144 patients with internal carotid 
artery (ICA) disease documented by angiography ( I I with 
bilateral lesions). Ipsilateral stroke occurred in one among 
90 patients with 50 to 90% ICA obstruction ( I. 1%), in one 
among 16 patients with more than 90% ICA obstruction 
(6.2%), and in one among 49 patients with total ICA 
occlusion (2.0%). The authors concluded that asymptomatic unilateral ICA stenosis less than 90% or ICA 
occlusion did not increase the risk of stroke during 
coronary artery bypass surgery ~5 (Table III). 
It is logical to maintain a higher perfusion pressure and 
flow than normal during CPB, and to use EEG monitoring 
to evaluate cerebral perfusion in patients with carotid 
stenosis. Gibbs et al. have demonstrated that cerebral 
blood flow ipsilateral to ICA occlusion was inappropriately low. 126 However, recent studies on cerebral blood flow 
monitoring in patients with severe carotid stenosis or 
occlusion during nonpulsatile hypothermic bypass showed 
no evidence for decreased cerebral perfusion. 112,127 
There is no evidence to justify routine prophylactic 
carotid endarlerectomy for patients with asymptomatic 
carotid disease before cardiac surgery. ~28 Patients can 
undergo cardiac procedures without carotid surgery as 
safely as if the carotid artery were repaired. ~29 
SYMPTOMATIC CAROTID ARTERY DISEASE 
Patients with symptomatic carotid artery disease, on the 
other hand, have an increased risk of perioperative stroke 
if they are subjected to CBP. tt4'130'13t These patients 
need revascularization of both the carotid and coronary 
arteries, and the choice is between staged and combined 
operations. A staged approach with carotid endarterectomy as the first procedure may result in some patients 
dying of cardiac complications before coronary surgery 
can be undertaken. Conversely, initial coronary revascularization may result in a high incidence of fatal stroke. ~32 
Under appropriat.e circumstances, both lesions can be 
treated simultaneously, t32- ~35 
The approach to the management of these patients 
varies among institutions. In general, each patient is 
assessed according to the severity of the disease, both 
clinically and anatomically, in each system. Staged 
procedures with carotid endarterectomy before coronary 
artery bypass is preferable for patients who have a low 
cardiac risk presenting with one- or two-vessel disease 
and stable angina. Combined procedures are appropriate 
for neurologically symptomatic patients who are at high 
cardiac risk presenting with left main coronary artery 
disease, severe multivessel lesions with inadequate collateral perfusion, or unstable angina. 136.137 
The combined carotid endarterectomy and coronary 
artery bypass procedure appears to be a logical approach 
for patients with high-risk cerebrovascular and coronary 
artery diseases, although it is not clear whether this 
approach increases or decreases the morbidity and mortality, compared with staged operations. A review of the 
combined procedures from 1972 to 1988 (a total of 1345 
patients) revealed a mean operative mortality rate of 
5.7%, permanent stroke rate of 3.0%, and myocardial 
infarction rate of 3.8%. 13a These figures are unacceptable 
for elective CABG in most institutions, and many 
institutions have discontinued the combined procedure 
approach. On the other hand, the recent experience from 
the Massachusetts General Hospital is encouraging. From 
1983 to 1987, there was no significant difference in either 
operative mortality (2.0% vs 2.2%) or perioperative 
stroke (2.0% vs 0.6%) in palients undergoing combined 
procedures and isolated coronary bypass grafting, 
respectively. 13s 
Few patients are suitable for the combined procedures: 
9.5% of 679 carotid endarterectomies performed at the 
Johns Hopkins Hospital, 139 and 2.8% of 9714 coronary 
artery bypass procedures at the Cleveland Clinic. ~4~ 
Perler et al. found that mortality associated with the 
combined procedures was influenced by age, left main 
coronary artery disease, male sex, history of congestive 
heart failure, and presence of bilateral carotid disease. 139 
Until further prospective studies are performed, the 
authors expressed caution in recommending the combined 
approach in elderly candidates or in those with three or 
more of the above risk factors. 

Wong: PERIOPERATIVE STROKE 479 
Perioperative cardiogenic embolic stroke 
Cardiogenic embolism accounts for 6 to 23% of all 
ischaemic strokes and is a frequent cause of fatal brain 
infarction. 141 Although data are lacking, cardiogenic 
embolism probably accounts for many perioperative 
strokes. Cardiogenic embolism is difficult to diagnose 
with certainty. Yasaka et al. found that intracardiac 
thrombi were frequently detected by repeated echocardiographic examination in patients with cerebral embolism. Dehydration seems to accelerate thrombus formation that is reflected by a decrease in antithrombin 111. ~42 
As cardiogenic strokes tend to be functionally devastating, and occur without warning, the primary emphasis 
must centre on their prevention. Perioperative cardiogenic stroke is more likely to occur in patients with some 
cardiac diseases, and may be associated with diagnostic 
and therapeutic procedures done to the heart. 
Cardiac diseases 
Patients who are at high risk of cardiogenic embolism 
include those with atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease and prosthetic heart valves. ~4~, ~43-~,~5 
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION 
Reed et al. found that atrial fibrillation increased the risk 
of perioperative stroke following CABG threefold. ~2~ 
Taylor et al. reported ten focal neurological deficits in a 
series of 453 patients undergoing CABG. Six of the 
deficits occurred in 86 patients who had postoperative 
atrial fibrillation (7%), and four occurred in 367 patients 
who had no postoperative atrial fibrillation (I%). 146 
Atrial fibrillation is found in 0.4% of the adult 
population; the prevalence increases with age, being 
2-4% after 60 years of age. It is the most common 
underlying cardiac disorder predisposing to systemic 
embolism. In the Framingham Study, the risk of a 
cerebral infarct in patients with chronic atrial fibrillation 
was found to be 5.6 times greater than in patients with 
sinus rhythm. The risk of first stroke is 4. 1% per year in 
patients with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation, and 4.5% 
per year in patients with atrial fibrillation associated with 
rheumatic valve disease. Once cerebral embolism has 
occurred, the risk for recurrent stroke is considerably 
higher, with recurrence rates of approximately 20% for 
~,~7 the first year and 37% for three years. 
Petersen and Hansen found that atrial fibrillation in the 
absence of rheumatic heart disease was associated with a 
more than five-fold increase in stroke incidence, whereas 
atrial fibrillation with rheumatic heart disease had a 
17-fold increase when compared with patients without 
atrial fibrillation. ~4s The risk of embolism is particularly 
high at the onset of atrial fibrillation. ~49, ~5o 
The first clinical presentation with an ischaemic stroke 
syndrome may not be the first episode of cardiogenic 
embolic brain infarction; cerebral emboli causing infarction may be asymptomatic. Silent cerebral infarctions are 
often demonstrated by computed tomogram in patients 
with chronic atrial fibrillation. ~5~.~52 
Long-term warfarin therapy is indicated when atrial 
fibrillation is associated with documented systemic embolism or mitral valvular disease. ~4s,~53,~,~4 
VALVULAR HEART DISEASES 
Rheumatic mitral valve disease is associated with a higher 
risk of systemic embolism than any other common form of 
heart disease. It is estimated that a patient with rheumatic 
mitral valve disease has at least a 20% chance of having a 
clinically detectable systemic embolus during the course 
of the disease, t55 When patients with mitral valve disease 
develop atrial fibrillation, the risk of systemic embolization increases dramatically. Therefore, all patients with 
rheumatic mitral valve disease associated with chronic or 
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, or who have documented 
systemic embolism, should receive long-term warfarin 
therapy sufficient to prolong the prothrombin time to 1.5 
times control. 143 
Mitral valve prolapse is the most common valve disease 
in adults, and is present in 2.5 to 17% of the general 
population.56- is8 Although it is generally innocuous, 
mitral valve prolapse may be associated with an increased 
incidence of atrial fibrillation, mitral regurgitation, infective endocarditis and embolic phenomena. The exact role 
of mitral valve prolapse in cerebral ischaemia is not 
clear. 1~9 Sandok and Giuliani reported a four-fold increase in strokes in persons with mitral valve prolapse 
compared to the normal population, a~ However, in large 
prospective series of stroke patients, mitral valve prolapse 
is detected in only 0 to 5%. ~6~-~66 
In young patients without other major risk factors for 
stroke, the presence of mitral valve prolapse may constitute a risk for cerebral ischaemia. 167 However, the overall 
incidence of stroke in young individuals with mitral valve 
prolapse is low, approximately one per 6,000 per year, or 
0.2%.168 Patients with asymptomatic mitral valve prolapse need not be on antithrombotic therapy. However, if 
unexplained TIAs occur, long-term aspirin is recommended. 143 
Aortic valve disease is associated with a low frequency 
of systemic thromboembolism, and long-term antithrombotic therapy is not indicated. 143 
PROSTHETIC HEART VALVES 
The risk of thromboembolism depends on the type and site 
of the valve. Tissue valves are generally less thrombogenic than mechanical valves. 144'169 The velocity of 
blood flow across the mitral valve is less than across the 

480 CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA 
aortic valve. With a greater deposition of platelets and 
fibrin on the mitral valve, the risk of emboli arising from 
the mitral prosthetic valve is therefore greater than that 
from the aortic prosthetic valve. ~7o 
Patients with mechanical prosthetic valves are at a 
significant risk for thromboembolism and require longterm anticoagulation, 171 and also antiplatelet agents 
postoperatively. ~72 Patients with tissue valves also require anticoagulation during the first 6 to 12 postoperative 
weeks. Anticoagulation is required for all patients with 
prosthetic valves if they have chronic atrial fibrillation or 
a previously documented embolic event. ~7~,173 The risk 
of embolism is reduced by therapy, but in about 2% of patients on long-term warfarin, the treatment is complicated 
by serious, frequent, intracranial haemorrhage. 174,175 
PERIOPERATIVE MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS ON 
LONG-TERM ANTICOAGULANT THERAPY 
The cardiac lesions for which long-term warfarin therapy 
is recommended by the American College of Chest 
Physicians and the National Heart, Lung and Blood 
Institute to prevent systemic embolism and stroke include: 
(I) atrial fibrillation with a history of systemic emboli, 
mitral valve disease, cardiomyopathy or thyrotoxicosis, 
(2) mitral valve disease with a history of systemic emboli, 
chronic or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, (3) mitral valve 
prolapse with atrial fibrillation, (4) mechanical prosthetic 
heart valves, and (5) bioprosthetic heart valves with mitral 
placement, history of systemic emboli, atrial fibrillation 
or left atrial thrombus. 1,13-i,.15 
In patients receiving long-term anticoagulation therapy 
and undergoing noncardiac operations, maintenance of 
anticoagulation can be associated with perioperative 
bleeding, and discontinuation can lead to thromboembolism. 176 For patients with isolated aortic prosthetic valves, 
warfarin should be discontinued two to three days before 
surgery to produce a normal prothrombin time on the day 
of operation, and resumed two days after the operation.176-178 Tinker and Tarhan found that discontinuing 
anticoagulation to restore the prothrombin time to within 
20% of control did not cause excessive perioperative 
bleeding, and was not associated with thromboembolic 
complications. 179 The risk of thromboembolism is greater 
in patients with mitral or combined prosthetic valves. In 
these patients, and in other patients at highest risk for 
thromboembolic complications, anticoagulation should 
be continued to within 24 hr of their surgery. The warfarin 
effect may be reversed with parenteral vitamin K or 
fresh-frozen plasma. 176,177 Intravenous heparin is started 
12 hr after the procedure when adequate haemostasis has 
been secured. The partial thromboplastin time is maintained at 1.5 to 2.5 times the levels of normal controls. 
When adequate surgical haemostasis is assured, usually 
three days after operation, oral anticoagulation with 
warfarin is resumed and the heparin is stopped when the 
prothrombin time reaches a therapeutic level. 176,177 
Alternatively, anticoagulation can be switched from 
warfarin to heparin. Heparin is started two to three days 
preoperatively, stopped 8 to 12 hr before surgery, and 
restarted postoperatively as soon as haemostasis is assured. Warfarin is resumed two to three days later. 
Heparin is discontinued when the prothrombin time has 
returned to the desired range.178 For the patient with a 
high risk ofthromboembolism, who has a prosthetic heart 
valve, chronic atrial fibrillation or persistent congestive 
heart failure, it may be safe to perform minor operations 
such as dental extractions or other procedures in accessible areas, while maintaining anticoagulation. ~78 
PERIOPERATIVE PROPHYLACTIC ANTIBIOTIC THERAPY 
Infective endocarditis may lead to septic embolism, 
causing ischaemic stroke and intracranial haemorrhage, iso.lsl Prophylactic antibiotic coverage during the 
perioperative period is important to prevent endocarditis 
in patients with valvular disease and prosthetic valves. 
Davenport and Hart retrospectively reviewed the outcomes of 61 patients with 62 episodes of prosthetic valve 
endocarditis. Eleven patients (I 8%) suffered an embolic 
stroke, usually within three days of diagnosis of endocarditis. No protective effect of anticoagulation therapy with 
warfarin was observed, and no specific risk of haemorrhagic stroke was evident with anticoagulant therapy. 182 
It appears that antibiotic treatment is more important than 
anticoagulation for preventing neurological complications in patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis. 
PATENT FORAMEN OVALE AND VENTRICULAR SEPTAL 
DEFECT 
Patent foramen ovale may be present in up to 40% of 
routine autopsies.~S3Recent reports suggest paradoxical 
embolism is responsible for an increased incidence of 
stroke in patients with patent foramen ovale, ~84- ~86 and 
perioperative stroke due to paradoxical embolism has 
been reported, ts7'lsa Black et al., using preoperative 
precordial echocardiography along with the Valsalva 
manoeuvre, detected right-to-left shunting in only six of a 
series of 101 patients scheduled for neurosurgical procedures in the sitting position. As a result of these findings, 
five of the six patients had their surgery performed either 
in the horizontal or in the prone position. Transoesophageal echocardiography further detected right-to-left shunting in four of these patients during surgery. ~s9 
Normally, the pressures in the left chambers of the 
heart are higher than in the right, but coughing or the 
Valsalva manoeuvre may increase right-sided pressures 
so that a venous thrombus may pass into the systemic 
circulation and lead to cerebral embolism. 
Paradoxical embolism and stroke may occur through 

Wong: PERIOPERATIVE STROKE 481 
similar mechanisms in patients with other intracardiac 
shunts, such as ventricular septal defect.t9~ Ventricular 
septal defect is found in 0.25 to 1% in autopsy studies, but 
its true incidence is difficult to assess, as many of the 
defects close spontaneously, t9~ 
The therapeutic implications in the perioperative period 
for patients with intracardiac shunts are obvious. Sources 
of venous emboli, such as deep venous thrombosis and 
those introduced through venous access lines, are to be 
prevented, and pressure increases on the right side of the 
heart, such as coughing and Valsalva manoeuvre, should 
be avoided. 
Diagnostic and therapeutic procedures 
oc CARmOVERSION 
Systemic embolism may complicate cardioversion of 
atrial fibrillation, especially in patients with mitral stenosis, prosthetic mitral valves, history ofembolic phenomena, enlarged hearts, or congestive heart failure. Bjerkelund and Orning reported embolization complicating 
cardioversion in 5.3% of patients without anticoagulation, but in only 0.8% in those receiving anticoagulant 
therapy, t92 It is recommended that anticoagulation be 
started three weeks before elective cardioversion to 
maintain the prothrombin time in the therapeutic range of 
!.2-1.5 times control. Anticoagulation should be continued for at least four weeks after cardioversion. This will 
reduce the formation of a new clot in a noncontractile 
atrium if mechanical resumption of atrial activity is 
delayed, t,~5 
PACEMAKER INSERTION 
Disturbances of cardiac rhythm and manipulation of wires 
in the heart may generate thrombi, However, the risk of 
stroke associated with the insertion of intravenous endocardial pacemakers is not known. Patients with the sick 
sinus syndrome are at risk for cardioembolic stroke. 
Stroke after pacemaker insertion for sick sinus syndrome 
occurs often in the presence of paroxysmal or sustained 
atrial fibrillation. Pacing with a ventricular-demand pacemaker does not appear to be protective. 193 
CORONARY ARTERIOGRAPHY AND CORONARY 
ANGIOPLASTY 
Stroke occasionally complicates coronary arteriography. 
Adams et al., in a survey of complications in 46,904 cases 
of coronary arteriography in 1970 and 1971, found that 
the incidence of cerebral embolism was 0.23%. The risk 
was higher when the femoral route was used for catheter 
access.tga Bourassa and Noble reported central nervous 
complications in ten of 5250 cases. Five patients had 
transient cerebral iscbaemia, two had temporary disorientation, and three had transient blurred vision. ,gs Transient

visual disturbance occasionally complicates cardiac catheterization. Oliva and Scherokman reported computedtomography-documented occipital lobe infarction in two 
patients with this complication. 196 Dawson and Fischer, 
in a survey of over 1000 cases, found ten cases of central 
nervous dysfunction. Nine of these were embolic in 
origin, mostly with local disorder in the vertebrobasilar 
territory. 197 Sones found four cases of cerebral emboli 
resulting in long-term deficits among 52,953 cases. 198 In 
a study of 30,000 cardiac catheterizations, Lockwood et 
al. found 37 central nervous system complications, with 
two global ischaemia, 15 in the carotid, and 20 in the 
vertebrobasilar distribution. While the neurological deficit resolved in 19, and persisted in 16, two of the patients 
died. Embolization and hypotension were responsible in 
most of the cases. Cerebrovascular disease, ventricular 
hypokinesia, mural thrombus and valvular disease were 
found to be contributing factors. 199 
From these studies, the overall incidence of stroke 
associated with coronary arleriography is less than I% 
(Table IV). 
Stroke has been reported following percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Although stroke was not 
listed in an initial report of 631 cases from the registry of 
the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, 2~176 five 
central nervous system events were seen in a subsequent 
report of 1500 patients (0.3%). There was one anoxic 
encephalopathy, one cerebrovascular accident, and three 
transient neurological deficits. 2~ Galbreath et al. reported 
a similar experience, with four (0.2%) central nervous 
system complications among 1829 patients having 1968 
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasties. One 
patient had a TIA, two had hemispheric infarcts, and one 
had a brainstem infarct. 2~ 
Conclusion 
Stroke, defined as a focal neurological deficit, in the 
perioperative period is an uncommon but devastating 
complication. Although medical risk factors for stroke are 
well defined in the general population, no large scale data 
are available that identify the importance of the individual 
risk factors as a cause of perioperative stroke. In most 
clinical situations including general surgery, carotid 

482 CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA 
endarterectomy, and cardiac surgery involving CPB, 
thromboembolism appears to be the most important cause 
of perioperative stroke. 
Cardiogenic embolism is a recognized complication of 
atrial fibrillation and valvular heart disease, and most 
perioperative strokes probably have a similar origin. With 
adequate monitoring and protection of the cerebral circulation, stroke associated with carotid surgery is most 
likely due to thromboembolism. Air and particle emboli 
are also the major causes of neurological deficits associated with CPB and open ventricle surgery. Patients with 
asymptomatic carotid disease do not appear to be at a 
higher risk of perioperative stroke than those with normal 
arteries. However, symptomatic carotid disease or critical 
carotid stenosis may increase this risk. 
Because of prolonged changes of regional cerebral 
blood flow and enhanced thrombin activity following a 
stroke, elective surgery should be postponed for six to ten 
weeks. Anaesthetic agents such as isoflurane and thiopentone have cerebral protection properties, but they have to 
be given in sufficient doses to produce burst suppression 
in the EEG. Their use has been recommended in high-risk 
patients or procedures, but can be associated with 
cardiovascular instability and prolonged emergence from 
anaesthesia.
