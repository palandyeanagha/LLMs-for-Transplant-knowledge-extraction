Replication and amplification of the viral genome is a key process for all viruses. For hepatitis
C virus (HCV), a positive-strand RNA virus, amplification of the viral genome requires the
synthesis of a negative-sense RNA template, which is in turn used for the production of new
genomic RNA. This process is governed by numerous proteins, both host and viral, as well as
distinct lipids and specific RNA elements within the positive- and negative-strand RNAs.
Moreover, this process requires specific changes to host cell ultrastructure to create microenvironments conducive to viral replication. This review will focus on describing the processes and factors involved in facilitating or regulating HCV genome replication.
The ∼9600-nucleotide hepatitis C virus
(HCV) RNA genome possesses one large
open reading frame (ORF) that is flanked
by highly structured 50 and 30 untranslated regions (UTRs) (Fig. 1). cis-acting RNA elements
(CREs) present within the UTRs as well as the
protein-coding region contribute to RNA translation and/or genome replication (for review,
see Adams et al. 2017). Synthesis of the HCV
proteins is mediated by the internal ribosome
entry site (IRES) located in the 50
UTR and facilitated by distinct elements in the 30
UTR as well
as CREs within the protein-coding region (Fig.
1). The IRES is composed of three stem-loop
(SL) domains. Of these, SLII and SLIII reside
in the 50
UTR and adopt an extended structure;
SLIV overlaps with the 50 end of the core coding
region and forms a short, rather unstable stem
that contains the start codon of the HCV ORF
(Fig. 1; Pérard et al. 2013; Quade et al. 2015).
Mechanistically, SLIII plays an important role in
IRES function because it facilitates the IRES–
40S ribosome subunit interaction by a conserved
base-pairing between the 18S rRNA and a sequence in SLIII (Matsuda and Mauro 2014). In
addition, SLII tightly associates with the head of
the 40S subunit, whereas SLIII displaces eIF3 to
allow the assembly of a translation-competent
ribosome (Hashem et al. 2013; Yamamoto
et al. 2015). Apart from the SL domains in the
50
UTR, several elements downstream of the
IRES impact RNA translation, including SL47
and SL87 (also called SLV and SLVI, respectively) in the core coding region (see below)
(McMullan et al. 2007; Vassilaki et al. 2008).
RNA translation is also modulated by the liv4

er-specific microRNA (miR)-122 that binds to
numerous sites within the viral genome (Jopling
et al. 2005).
Translation of the viral RNA leads to the
production of an ∼3000 amino acid polyprotein
from which the individual viral proteins are liberated through the cumulative activity of both
host and viral proteases (Fig. 1; Table 1). The
structural proteins (i.e., core and the envelope
glycoproteins E1 and E2) are the main constituents of HCV particles, whereas the viroporin
p7 and nonstructural protein (NS) 2 are involved in virion assembly but are not incorporated into the virus particle (see Shimotohno
2019). The remaining nonstructural proteins
(i.e., NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B)
have specific roles in viral genome amplification.
NS3 has several functions. The amino-terminal
domain, together with the cofactor NS4A, is a
serine-type protease required for polyprotein
cleavage and proteolytic processing of host cell
factors (Failla et al. 1994; Bartenschlager et al.
1995; Meylan et al. 2005). The carboxy-terminal
NS3 domain is a helicase and possesses an additional NTPase activity that is required for
RNA unwinding (see below). Moreover, NS3,
via interaction with the NS2 protease domain,
is involved in the assembly of HCV particles

(Counihan et al. 2011). NS4B is a highly hydrophobic protein involved in inducing membrane
alterations that are required for the biogenesis of
the viral replication organelle (RO). NS5A is a
multifunctional phosphoprotein required for
both RNA replication and assembly. NS5B
shows RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity and therefore plays the central role for the
amplification of the viral genome. Each of the
viral proteins are bound to intracellular membranes by various means, including complex
transmembrane domains (e.g., NS2, NS4B), a
monotopic α-helix (e.g., NS5A), or a single
transmembrane helix (e.g., NS5B) (Fig. 1).
Therefore, the HCV replication cycle occurs
on membrane surfaces, thus reducing dimensionality.
HCV-INDUCED MEMBRANE ALTERATIONS
Early electron microscopy (EM) studies of liver
tissues from infected patients or chimpanzees
indicated that HCV induces membrane alterations in infected hepatocytes (Jackson et al.
1979; Shimizu et al. 1990; Shimizu 1992), which
is a hallmark of all positive-strand RNA viruses.
With the advent of robust cell culture models for
HCV, it became possible to study structure–
function relationships of HCV proteins. It was
found that the expression of individual viral
proteins induced membrane alterations (Egger
et al. 2002). Notably, the sole expression of
NS4B induces a condensed membrane structure, consisting of single-membrane vesicles in
a membranous matrix. This structure was given
the designation “membranous web,” and it was
also found in cells containing a subgenomic replicon of moderate replication competence (Gosert et al. 2003). However, in hepatoma cells
containing a highly replication-competent
HCV isolate, designated JFH-1, because it was
isolated from a Japanese patient with fulminant
hepatitis (Kato et al. 2003), the predominant
virus-induced membrane structure is doublemembrane vesicles (DMVs) that accumulate in
the cytoplasm, often in close proximity of lipid
droplets (Fig. 2). Although single-membrane
vesicles were detected rather sporadically, multimembrane vesicles were observed primarily at
late time points after infection and are thought
to reflect a stress response induced by high-level
virus replication (Ferraris et al. 2010; RomeroBrey et al. 2012; Paul et al. 2013). DMVs are
heterogeneous in size, with an average diameter
of ∼200 nm, and are morphologically similar to
membrane alterations identified in cells infected
with coronaviruses (Gosert et al. 2002; Knoops
et al. 2008) or picornaviruses (Belov et al. 2012).
In the case of HCV, double-stranded RNA
(dsRNA) and nonstructural proteins have been
found in association with DMV membranes
(Ferraris et al. 2010; Romero-Brey et al. 2012;
Paul et al. 2013). This result and the observed
correlation between DMV abundance and viral
RNA replication argue that DMVs are the sites
of viral genome replication (Ferraris et al. 2010;
Romero-Brey et al. 2012; Paul et al. 2013). However, it is still unclear whether all DMVs are
engaged in HCV replication and whether RNA
replication occurs on the interior or exterior
membrane surface of the DMV.
Several studies have reported that viral proteins and RNA associated with the viral ROs are
protected from exogenously added proteases or
nucleases, indicating that RNA replication occurs in a membranous environment that is segregated from the surrounding cytoplasm (Miyanari et al. 2003; Quinkert et al. 2005; Hsu
et al. 2010; Paul et al. 2013). Interestingly, most
DMVs appear to be closed structures and only a
minority (∼8%) have an opening pore toward the
cytosol (Fig. 2; Romero-Brey et al. 2012). This
morphology suggests that if replication occurs
on the interior surface of DMVs, then a transport
mechanism must be present to allow import of
metabolites required for replication as well as export of viral RNA for translation or virion assembly. Alternatively, in a model in which replication
occurs on the outer surface of DMVs or on open
DMVs, a more complex architecture of the RO
must exist to explain the protection of viral RNA
from attack by exogenously added nucleases. In
either case, the protected nature of the viral RNA
indicates a transport mechanism to mediate the
movement of macromolecules between cellular
compartments. This model is supported by observations that HCV hijacks specific cellular components involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport,

Figure 2. HCV replication organelle. After entering the cell, the HCV genome is released into the cytosol and
translated at the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Viral proteins, in cooperation with host factors, induce
intracellular membrane alterations consisting of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs), single-membrane vesicles
(SMVs), and multimembrane vesicles (MMVs). DMVs, usually found in close association with lipid droplets
(LDs), are protrusions of the ER that contain nonstructural proteins required for genome amplification (inset A).
These vesicles are open toward the cytosol or are closed (represented as gray shaded vesicles), possibly reflecting
different stages of DMV “maturation” (early and late, respectively). Viral RNA amplification may occur inside
DMVs, which would allow the exit of newly synthetized viral genomes as long as the DMV is open. RNA
molecules might be delivered by NS5A and NS3 to nearby assembly sites enriched in core protein and E1-E2
envelope glycoprotein complexes that are associated with p7 and NS2. Alternatively, replication might occur on
the outer surface of DMVs (not represented). Particles are formed by budding into the lumen of the ER. (Inset B)
DMVs emanate from ER membranes that are tightly wrapped around LDs as revealed by a combination of live
cell imaging and electron tomography. (Left) Single tomographic slice of an HCV-infected cell revealing two
classes of LDs. First, an LD (LD) that is tightly wrapped by the ER and that stains positive for E2 and NS5A as
revealed by fluorescence microscopy (not shown) and, second, several LDs that are not wrapped by the ER and
that do not stain for E2 and NS5A (LD) suggesting that HCV proteins trigger LD wrapping by ER membranes.
(Right) 3D reconstruction of the membranes surrounding LD. ER membrane and DMVs are shown in yellowgray; the LD monolayer membrane is shown in violet. Note the DMVs originating from the wrapping ER
membrane. In some cases, a stalk-like connection between DMVs and the ER is visible. Assuming that RNA
replication occurs in these DMVs, only short-distance trafficking of viral RNAwould be required to the ER lumen
to allow virus budding (as indicated in the schematic above). (Images in inset B are adapted from images in Lee

and that these cellular factors are involved in
maintaining a selective barrier between the cytosol and the interior of viral ROs (Neufeldt et al.
2013, 2016). However, the mechanisms underlying this transport process as well as the nature of
the barrier between replication compartments
and the surrounding cytosol remain unclear.
Viral Factors Involved in HCV Replication
Organelle Formation
Although individual expression of the nonstructural proteins induces membrane alterations,
NS5A was found to be the only protein capable
of inducing DMV formation on its own (Egger
et al. 2002; Romero-Brey et al. 2012). However,
the efficiency of DMV formation is rather low,
but is greatly enhanced when NS5A is expressed
as part of an NS3–NS5B polyprotein fragment.
Mutation analyses identified important motifs
in HCV proteins required for DMV formation.
These include the helicase domain in NS3,
glycine zipper motifs in NS4B, the amino-terminal NS5A membrane anchor, and domain 1 of
NS5A (Romero-Brey et al. 2015; Paul et al. 2018).
The important role of NS5A in HCV RO formation is best illustrated by the observation that
highly active NS5A inhibitors such as daclatasvir
block formation of the HCV RO independent of
RNA replication (Berger et al. 2014). Molecular
docking studies and the positioning of daclatasvir resistance mutations suggest that the drug
binds to the membrane-proximal side of NS5A
domain I (Berger et al. 2014; Nettles et al. 2014).
Therefore, NS5A inhibitors appear to block formation of the HCV RO through disturbing the
positioning, folding, and/or flexibility of the
linker segment connecting the amino-terminal
α-helix and domain I.
In addition to NS5A, NS4B also plays a central role in HCV RO biogenesis. NS4B has a
complex membrane topology that is comprised
of four amphipathic α-helices, two at the
amino-terminal and two at the carboxy-terminal region, which flank four transmembranespanning α-helices (Fig. 1; for review, see
Bartenschlager et al. 2013). These terminal protein domains can alter membrane properties
and likely undergo posttranslational membrane
topology changes (Palomares-Jerez et al. 2012,
2013), presumably in an NS5A-regulated manner (Lundin et al. 2006). Additionally, NS4B
forms oligomeric complexes via self-interaction,
which is mediated in part by a glycine zipper
within transmembrane segments 2 and 3 (Paul
et al. 2018). This self-interaction is required for
HCV RNA replication and the formation of
functional ROs (Gouttenoire et al. 2010, 2014;
Paul et al. 2011).
The insertion of the amino-terminal amphipathic α-helix of NS5A, which was shown to
alter model membranes in vitro (PalomaresJerez et al. 2010), into just one membrane layer
and the formation of conically shaped protein
complexes in the membrane, as might be the
case with NS4B, could facilitate membrane curvature required for RO formations (McMahon
and Gallop 2005; McMahon and Boucrot 2015).
In addition to these direct roles, viral proteins,
especially NS5A, might contribute to membrane
alterations by recruiting host factors required for
RO biogenesis.
Host Factors and Processes Involved in HCV
Replication Organelle Formation
In addition to viral proteins and the RNA genome, host cell factors and machineries also
contribute to DMV biogenesis. One example is
macro-autophagy, the bulk degradation and recycling of cytosolic proteins or organelles. It was
shown that HCV induces autophagy, and that
the depletion of specific autophagy factors impairs HCV RNA replication and reduces the
number of DMVs (for review, see Wang and
Ou 2018). Moreover, HCV-induced DMVs
have a striking morphological similarity to autophagosomes, which are also cytosolic doublemembrane structures. However, DMVs induced
by HCV have an average diameter of ∼200 nm
and thus are smaller than autophagosomes,
which have a diameter of 500–1000 nm. It
may be that HCV induces DMV formation by
using only specific components of the autophagy pathway, in combination with viral proteins,
leading to the formation of vesicular structures
that have similar membrane topology but differ
in overall size.

Although HCV-induced DMVs are derived
from the ER membrane, their lipid composition
is different from the originating membrane,
having much higher levels of cholesterol and
sphingolipids. NS5A recruits and activates the
lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIIα
(PI4KA) (Berger et al. 2011; Reiss et al. 2011),
which produces phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) at HCV protein-containing membranes (Fig. 3, inset). NS5A also binds to and
recruits, likely via VAP-A/B, lipid-transfer proteins, most notably oxysterol-binding protein
(Wang et al. 2014). By analogy to results obtained in the yeast system (Mesmin et al. 2013,

(PI4KA) to produce a local accumulation of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P). This may determine the
directionality of cholesterol transfer by lipid transfer proteins (LTPs), such as oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP),
which is recruited by NS5Avia VAP-A/B and releases cholesterol in exchange for PIP4 at these membrane contact
sites. VAP proteins might serve as anchors for additional host proteins promoting the formation of endoplasmic
reticulum (ER)–late endosome (LE) membrane contacts. Here NPC1, possibly in coordination with NPC2,
mediates the export of unesterified cholesterol that might be accepted by lipid transfer proteins recruited by
HCV (indicated with a question mark). (B,C) HCV infection activates the transcription of lipogenic genes by two

2017), we hypothesize that oxysterol-binding
protein (OSBP) delivers cholesterol into the
DMV membrane in exchange for PI4P (Paul
and Bartenschlager 2015). Another lipid-transfer protein, NPC1, possibly together with NPC2
transports unesterified cholesterol to DMVs and
contributes to the establishment of a microenvironment conducive for efficient HCV RNA
replication (Fig. 3, inset; Stoeck et al. 2017). Additionally, the glucosylceramide transfer protein
FAPP2 might be recruited to DMVs to release
lipids in exchange for PI4P into the membrane
of DMVs (Khan et al. 2014). Overall, these cellular lipid transfer proteins contribute to the
enrichment of distinct lipids that could form
lipid rafts assumed to be required for high-level
HCV replicase activity and possibly the assembly of infectious HCV particles.
Although numerous studies have provided
important insights into the biogenesis and
function of HCV-induced ROs, many questions
related to DMV formation remain unanswered.
For instance, what is the exact site of HCV RNA
replication? Is it SMVs or DMVs? What is the
relationship between these two vesicle species?
Assuming that DMVs are the site of RNA replication, are they all engaged in replication or
only a subpopulation? The observation that
only ∼8% of DMVs analyzed at a given time
point have a pore-like opening argues that the
latter is correct. Alternatively, DMVs might be
transient structures that are actively engaged in
RNA replication as long as they have an opening to the cytosol, but on closure might become
inactive and released out of the cell as extracellular vesicles (Grünvogel et al. 2018). Other
questions relate to the molecular mechanisms
by which DMVs and MMVs are formed from
intracellular (ER-derived) membranes. What is
the role of autophagy in this process? Are
MMVs a by-product resulting from a cellular
stress response induced by HCV? And how is
viral cargo transported between HCV-induced
subcellular compartments (i.e., sites of RNA
translation, RNA replication, and virion assembly)? How is this transport coordinated? These
questions illustrate that more studies are required to clearly define the roles of virus-induced membrane alterations in the replication
cycle of HCV, and positive-strand RNA viruses
in general.
GENOME REPLICATION
RNA Elements Involved in Genome
Amplification
Amplification of the viral genome requires a concerted effort from viral proteins and RNA elements as well as specific host factors. Outside the
context of protein production, RNA structural
elements found in both the positive-sense viral
genome and the negative-strand replication intermediate are essential for viral genome replication. RNA structures found in the 50
UTR of the
positive-strand RNA are primarily involved in
translation initiation, but several SL structures
designated SLI and SLII have been linked to genome replication (Fig. 4; Friebe et al. 2001; Friebe
and Bartenschlager 2002). This link is likely associated with the 30 end of the negative-strand
RNA, which forms distinct secondary structures
from those found in the positive strand (Fig. 4).
In fact, several independent studies have confirmed SL elements in the 30 terminal region of
the negative-strand RNA, including SLI0
, SLIIz0,
SLIIy0
, SLIIIa0, and SLIIIb0; additional elements
have been suggested but specific structures and
functions remain uncertain (Schuster et al. 2002;
Dutkiewicz et al. 2008). Sequence pertaining to
the regions of SLI0 and SLIIz0 has been genetically
mapped as the minimal requirements for synthesis of the positive-strand RNA from the negative-strand RNA template, and functional assays show that SLIIy0 is also required for RNA
synthesis (Friebe et al. 2001; Friebe and Bartenschlager 2009). The importance of the SLI0
element has also been confirmed by in vitro approaches, which also indicate a role for SLIIIb0
in promoting RNA synthesis. However, contrary
to the in cellulo analysis, biochemical assays suggested that SLIIz0 inhibits rather than promotes
RNA synthesis (Astier-Gin et al. 2005; Masante
et al. 2008; Mahias et al. 2010). This discrepancy
may indicate the presence of additional control elements in host cells that are required to
regulate the structure of the SLIIz0 region or its
function in viral genome replication.

Downstream of the positive-strand RNA
50
UTR, several RNA elements have been identified in the core coding region that promote full
genome replication, including SL87 (also designated SLVI or SL427) and the SL248 element
(also called SL588) (Fig. 4; McMullan et al.
2007; Vassilaki et al. 2008; Pirakitikulr et al.
2016). For SL87, which has previously been
described as a translational promoter, this may
indicate a dual role in both RNA translation and
genome replication. The SL248 element has
been linked to replication in the context of full
genome virus, but genomes in which this structure has been genetically altered are still replication-competent and produce infectious virus
(Vassilaki et al. 2008; Pirakitikulr et al. 2016).
Interestingly, mutually exclusive interactions
between SL248 and the adjacent SL87 might
serve as a molecular switch between efficient
replication and infectious virus production (Pirakitikulr et al. 2016). This suggests that RNA
structures found throughout the viral genome
contribute complex mechanisms involved in
regulating different viral processes.
In addition to the 50 end of positive-strand
RNA, several RNA elements present in the
30
UTR and the NS5B-coding region are essential for genome replication. The 30
UTR is comprised of a variable region, a poly(U/UC) tract of
variable length and a highly conserved 30 region
designated the 30
X-tail (Fig. 4; Tanaka et al.

gions contribute to viral replication with the 30
X
and a minimal poly(U/UC) region being essential and the variable region contributing to efficient replication (Tanaka et al. 1995, 1996; Kolykhalov et al. 1996, 2000; Blight and Rice 1997;
Yanagi et al. 1999; Friebe and Bartenschlager
2002; Smith et al. 2002; Yi and Lemon 2003a,
b; Friebe et al. 2005; You and Rice 2008). Initiation of negative-strand RNA synthesis begins at
the terminal uridine that is base-paired to a guanosine in the 30
X SL1. In this structure, access of
the terminal nucleotide for the NS5B polymerase is limited, suggesting that alternative RNA
structures are involved in regulating the initiation of RNA synthesis (Fricke et al. 2015). In
addition, in the NS5B-coding region, a cis-acting RNA element (CRE; also called 5BSL3.2)
has been identified as a crucifix-like structure
and forms a kissing loop interaction with the
30
X SL2, which is essential for replication (You
et al. 2004; Friebe et al. 2005). This CRE also
forms long-range interactions with SLIII in
the 50
UTR (Fig. 4) and has been proposed to
regulate switching between replication and
translation (Lee et al. 2004; You et al. 2004; Romero-López and Berzal-Herranz 2009, 2012,
2017). Additional long-range interactions
between 30 and 50 elements, facilitated by
trans-acting host factors, have been shown to
potentiate viral genome replication (for review,
see Niepmann et al. 2018). Three other SL elements within the coding region have also been
linked to replication, SL6038, J7880, and J8880
(Fig. 4), but the specific functions of these elements remain to be determined (Mauger et al.
2015; Pirakitikulr et al. 2016).
Virus Protein Contributions to Genome
Replication
NS5B Polymerase
A plethora of studies examining NS5B, which
harbors RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
(RdRp) activity (Behrens et al. 1996; Lohmann
et al. 1997), have given us significant insights
into its structural and functional properties.
NS5B is a tail-anchored protein composed of
an amino-terminal catalytic domain that makes
up the majority of NS5B, and a carboxy-terminal trans-membrane domain tethering the protein in the membrane (Fig. 1). The trans-membrane domain is essential for RNA replication in
cells, most likely to allow proper insertion into
the membranous replicase machinery, yet dispensable for enzymatic activity and is therefore
deleted in most biochemical or structural assays
to increase solubility of the protein. Like all viral
RdRps, NS5B has a “right-hand”shape containing palm, thumb, and fingers domains (for
review, see Sesmero and Thorpe 2015). Additionally, HCV NS5B contains a β-flap domain
that is specific to Flaviviridae RdRps and a linker
domain that is common to de novo initiating
enzymes. Through well-defined mechanisms,
each of these domains contributes to specific
steps in viral RNA synthesis (for review, see
Sesmero and Thorpe 2015).
RNA synthesis processes governed by NS5B
can be divided into four steps: RNA binding,
initiation, processive elongation, and termination at the end of the template. Although early
reports show that NS5B can initiate RNA synthesis using both primer-based and de novo
mechanisms, structural evidence suggests that
NS5B uses de novo initiation to replicate the viral
genome in cells (Behrens et al. 1996; Lohmann
et al. 1997; Luo et al. 2000; Sun et al. 2000; Zhong
et al. 2000). It is thought that initiation starts
directly at the 30 end of the viral RNA genome
and requires high levels of GTP that bind to an
allosteric site in the enzyme to act as a structural
support to prime the initiation process (Lohmann et al. 1999b). As discussed above, the 30
end of the positive-strand RNA is a poor template for de novo initiation, as it is concealed
within an SL structure. In contrast, the 30 end
of the negative-strand RNA consists of a stem
loop with an overhang (Fig. 4) that serves as a
highly efficient initiator of RNA synthesis. This
difference likely has a role in regulation of the
replication processes and might contribute to
the 10-fold excess of positive- over negativestrand RNA. It is highly advantageous for
HCV to regulate production of negative-strand
RNA, as increased RNA synthesis interferes with
translation and excess dsRNA intermediates
would stimulate innate immune responses.

NS5B can bind to many RNA target sequences and initiate RNA syntheses both internally within the viral genome and on circular
RNA templates, arguing for a lack of specificity
for the viral genomic RNA ends (Lohmann et al.
1997; Shim et al. 2002; Ranjith-Kumar and Kao
2006). These properties indicate that the enzyme is not limited to the “closed” conformation
that is suggested by most structural analysis. In
fact, recent studies identified an NS5B open state
that can also accommodate primer and template
RNA, which is consistent with early reports that
purified NS5B can initiate using both primerbased and de novo mechanisms. These observations argue that, in solution, there is equilibrium
between open and closed states that may serve
different functions in the replication cycle. Additionally, several reports have shown that NS5B
can bind to 30
UTRs of specific host mRNAs
(Yuhashi et al. 2014). In combination with low
specificity for RNA targets, these observations
lend to the hypothesis that NS5B can amplify
host RNAs, which could be involved in regulation of host protein production or in activation
of innate immune responses (Yu et al. 2012).
Although NS5B alone does not seem to have
specificity for the viral genome, genetic studies
argue that an interaction between the NS3 helicase, NS5A, and NS5B is required for initiation
of RNA synthesis (Binder et al. 2007) indicating
that template specificity is conferred by a combination of viral factors. In addition, the HCV
replicase is tethered in intracellular membranes,
which limits access to cellular RNAs.
NS3-4A
HCV NS3 is a bifunctional enzymatic protein
containing a carboxy-terminal DExD-box helicase domain (NS3h) and an amino-terminal
protease domain that function in conjunction
with the cofactor, NS4A (Fig. 1). Whereas the
protease domain is indirectly involved in replication through its role in polyprotein processing, the helicase domain has a more direct role in
RNA synthesis. Consistent with this assumption, specific NS3h mutations alter HCV replication fitness and a correlation between nucleic
acid unwinding activity and replicative ability
was observed (Stross et al. 2016; Zhou et al.
2018). Several studies have indicated an allosteric mechanism that governs a switch between
protease activity and helicase activity, with the
“open or extended form” showing higher DNA
unwinding function and representing the biologically relevant state for RNA replication
(Ding et al. 2011; Saalau-Bethell et al. 2012).
Thus, in the current model, the protease domain
also contributes to the activity of the helicase
domain (Beran et al. 2007). Although the
DNA unwinding mechanism of HCV NS3h is
well characterized (Gu and Rice 2010), its precise function within the viral replication cycle
remains elusive. Specifically, the helicase activity
could be required for the dissociation of highly
structured single-stranded RNA elements before NS5B-mediated template-guided RNA synthesis or it could function in dissociating dsRNA
following replication. In either case, the NS3
helicase activity is critically required for HCV
RNA replication.
NS5A
NS5A is a promiscuous viral protein that has
roles at several stages of the viral life cycle (for
review, see Ross-Thriepland and Harris 2015).
NS5A can bind to RNA and forms homodimers
and probably also higher-order structures. It
contains three defined domains, linked by lowcomplexity sequences (LCSs), and an aminoterminal amphipathic α-helix that facilitates
membrane association and is essential for genome replication (Fig. 1; Penin et al. 2004). Domain I contains an RNA-binding motif and is
linked to virus replication as well as RO biogenesis (Huang et al. 2005; Romero-Brey et al.
2015), whereas domain III functions primarily
in virion assembly (Appel et al. 2008). Although
the major part of domain II is dispensable for
replication, specific residues in the carboxyl
terminus are required for genome replication
(Appel et al. 2008; Tellinghuisen et al. 2008;
Ross-Thriepland and Harris 2014). These different NS5A functions seem to be regulated via
differential phosphorylation states. Early studies
described two prominent phospho-isoforms
for NS5A that could be separated by sodium

dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and were designated the
basally phosphorylated p56 and the hyperphosphorylated p58 (Kaneko et al. 1994). However,
this view has been challenged by opposing data
sets obtained from experiments performed with
genotype 1b versus 2a HCV strains. Additionally, recent reports showed that the NS5A p58
isoform consists of several independently phosphorylated species that perform different functions and argue for an essential role of p58 in
both assembly and RNA replication (Masaki
et al. 2014; Harak et al. 2016; Schenk et al.
2018). In any case, reports have consistently
linked several phospho-acceptor-sites in the
LCS1 region to viral genome replication, and
showed that limiting phosphorylation of these
sites by blocking the casein kinase I isoform α
(CKIα) limits replication and virion assembly
(Appel et al. 2005; Quintavalle et al. 2006;
Pietschmann et al. 2009; Masaki et al. 2014;
Harak et al. 2016; Goonawardane et al. 2018).
This suggests that phosphorylation in this region
may function as a regulatory switch between
RNA replication and virion assembly. The combined data on NS5A highlight the multipurpose
nature of this protein and the complexity of regulating its different functions through multiple
phosphorylation events. This complexity makes
experimental characterization of specific NS5A
functions exceedingly difficult. At the same
time, the multiple functions exerted by NS5A
might explain the exceptional antiviral potency
of NS5A inhibitors that most likely block several
steps of the viral life cycle such as RNA replication and virion assembly (Berger et al. 2014;
McGivern et al. 2014). Although the precise
mechanisms for how this multifunctionality is
achieved are unknown, it is tempting to speculate that various NS5A phosphovariants bind to
distinct host cell factors, such as PI4KA, VAPA/
B, or apolipoprotein E, that exert the required
function.
HOST CELL FACTORS OF RELEVANCE TO
HCV GENOME REPLICATION
We can assume that for each individual step of
the HCV life cycle, host cell factors are required.
These can be proteins, lipids, and/or nucleic acids. During the last years, numerous factors of
this kind have been identified and characterized,
but only a few key examples can be mentioned
here because of space limitations. The reader
interested in more in-depth discussion of this
aspect is referred to more recent reviews (RossThriepland and Harris 2015; Sarnow and Sagan
2016; Wang and Tai 2016).
miRNAs are a class of small noncoding
RNAs with an approximate length of 22 nucleotides, which are involved in the posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression. Certain
miRNAs are expressed ubiquitously, whereas
miR-122 is specifically expressed in the liver.
Interestingly, binding sites for miR-122 are present in the 50
UTR, 30UTR, and the NS5B-coding
regions of the HCV positive-strand RNA genome (Fig. 4) and are linked to various viral
processes (for reviews, see Sarnow and Sagan
2016; Bernier and Sagan 2018). Original studies
showed that HCV RNA mutated in miR-122-
targeting 30
UTR sequence was replicated as
well as wild-type, whereas HCV RNA mutated
in 50
UTR target sequence affected RNA accumulation and translation (Jopling et al. 2005),
suggesting that HCV replication is dependent
on miR-122 binding. On one hand, in typical
interactions of miRNAs with mRNA, miRNAs
promote translational repression and/or degradation of the target RNA. On the other hand, in
the case of HCV, miR-122 has a positive effect
by binding to the viral RNA genome in association with Agonaute-2 (Ago2) and protecting
the viral genome from nucleolytic degradation
by host 50
-30 exoribonucleases 1 (XRN1) and
XRN2 (Fig. 3; Shimakami et al. 2012; Li et al.
2013b, 2015). XRN activity is usually specific to
50 monophosphate transcripts and not the 50
triphosphate product of viral polymerase. In
this case, the 50 RNA triphosphatase, DUSP11,
functions together with XRNs to restrict HCV, a
process that is prevented by miR-122 binding
(Fig. 3; Amador-Cañizares et al. 2018a; Kincaid
et al. 2018). It is also reported that miR-122
binding contributes to the folding of a functional IRES by suppressing energetically favorable
alternative secondary structures (Amador-Cañizares et al. 2018b; Schult et al. 2018; Chahal
HCV Replication

et al. 2019). Additionally, a recent study of the
miR-122-binding sites in the NS5B-coding region correlated miR-122 binding with genome
replication (Gerresheim et al. 2017). Specifically,
mutations in the miR-122-binding site denoted
5B.2 (Fig. 4) caused a significant decrease in
HCV RNA accumulation. However, compensatory mutations in this region that restore miR122 binding failed to rescue viral RNA accumulation indicating that this RNA region has a role
beyond that of direct miR-122 binding (Bernier
and Sagan 2019). Together, these studies show
that miR-122 is intricately involved in regulating
different stages of the HCV infection cycle. It is
an essential HCV host dependency factor and its
depletion renders cells nonpermissive for this
virus under physiological conditions.
Another host factor required for HCV replication is the prolyl-peptidylcis-transisomerase
cyclophilin A (CypA), which alters the conformation of proteins by interconverting the cis and
trans isomers of peptide bonds with the amino
acid proline. CypA is ubiquitously expressed in
tissues and inhibited by cyclosporine A (CsA) or
nonimmunosuppressive compounds binding
tightly to CypA. Initial studies showed that
CsA treatment efficiently suppressed viral replication (Watashi et al. 2003). Subsequent studies
showed that CypA interacts with NS5A, and that
binding appears to catalyze the isomerization of
peptidyl-prolyl bonds in NS5A domain I and
domain II, resulting in conformational changes
in NS5A (Badillo et al. 2017, and references cited
therein). These alterations may stimulate the
RNA-binding capacity of NS5A and enhance
viral replication. Interestingly, CypA and NS5B
competitively bind to a similar region of NS5A
suggesting a regulatory role for CypA in the formation of virus protein interactions and genome
replication (Rosnoblet et al. 2012; Ngure et al.
2016). CypA activity also seems to be required
for the formation of HCV Ros, because CypA
antagonists such as cyclosporine D block de
novo formation of ROs (Madan et al. 2014).
The development of tools such as subgenomic replicons (Lohmann et al. 1999a), the
infectious HCV cell culture system that was
based on the unique viral isolate JFH-1 (Wakita
et al. 2005) and highly permissive hepatoma cell
lines (Blight et al. 2002; Friebe et al. 2005; Zhong
et al. 2005), enabled us to study different aspects
of the HCV life cycle. However, replication of
primary isolates contained in patient serum has
been notoriously difficult. Recently, two discoveries have been made that provide explanations
for this difficulty. The first discovery was reported by Saeed and colleagues who found that overexpression of SEC14L2 in Huh7.5 cells allowed
some replication of nonadapted HCV isolates
(Saeed et al. 2015). SEC14L2 is a phosphatidylinositol transfer protein involved in the regulation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/
Akt signaling pathway, cholesterol synthesis,
and vitamin E metabolism (Kempná et al.
2003; Mokashi and Porter 2005; Mokashi et al.
2005; Ni et al. 2005; Neuzil et al. 2006). Although the precise mode of action of SEC14L2
in the HCV replication cycle is unknown, part of
the mechanism appears to be an enhanced vitamin E–mediated inhibition of lipid peroxidation
(Saeed et al. 2015). Consistently, replication of
HCV isolates resistant to lipid peroxidation,
such as JFH-1, is not stimulated by SEC14L2
expression. The second discovery was made by
Harak and coworkers, who studied the mechanism by which RNA replication–enhancing
mutations that accumulate in natural HCV sequences on passage in cell culture stimulate
HCV replication in hepatoma cell lines. The
authors found that these genetic changes are
loss-of-function mutations that attenuate the interaction between HCV NS5A and PI4KA
(Harak et al. 2016). As alluded to above (see
Host Factors and Processes Involved in HCV
Replication Organelle Formation), this lipid kinase is required to render HCV-remodeled
membranes conducive to RNA replication
(Fig. 3, inset). Of note, the majority of hepatoma
cell lines express high levels of PI4KA, which
appears to be deleterious to robust HCV replication. This defect can be compensated either by
mutations that impair the interaction with this
lipid kinase, which is the case with HCV replication–enhancing mutations, or by pharmacological inhibition of PI4KA (Harak et al. 2016).
Thus, enhanced HCV replication in cell culture
is mediated, at least in part, by loss-of-function
mutations.

LIPID-MODULATING HOST CELL FACTORS
OF RELEVANCE TO HCV GENOME
REPLICATION
The extensive remodeling of intracellular membranes induced by HCV and the assembly of
highly lipidated HCV particles require the production and accumulation of distinct lipids.
Consistently, lipidomic profiling of HCV-infected cells revealed distinct alterations of host
cell lipid composition (Diamond et al. 2010). In
addition to the importance of cholesterol in
HCV replication described above, fatty acid biosynthetic pathways are also required for efficient
HCV replication. Indeed, inhibition of fatty acid
synthesis by blocking acetyl-CoA carboxylase
decreases viral replication (Kapadia and Chisari
2005). Furthermore, increases in saturated and
monounsaturated fatty acids enhance HCV replication, whereas increases in polyunsaturated
fatty acids suppress replication (Kapadia and
Chisari 2005). These results suggest that specific
lipids and membrane fluidity are important for
the function of the membranous HCV RO.
Moreover, distinct lipids might form lipid rafts
required for assembly and activity of the viral
replicase. Consistent with this assumption, extraction of cholesterol from the replicase complex impairs replicase activity (Paul et al. 2013).
In addition, sphingolipids were shown to stimulate HCV replicase activity (Weng et al. 2010;
Hirata et al. 2012).
Lipid metabolism is regulated by a family of
sterol regulatory element–binding proteins
(SREBPs). SREBPs are transcription factors
that activate the expression of more than 30
genes involved in biosynthesis or uptake of cholesterol, fatty acids, triglycerides, and phospholipids. In the case of HCV, virus-induced ER
stress or viral proteins such as NS4B (Waris
et al. 2007; Park et al. 2009) trigger the normally
ER-localized inactive SREBP precursor to traffic
to the Golgi, where it is proteolytically cleaved
by site 1 protease (S1P) and S2P (Fig. 3). The
released amino-terminal fragment is transported into the nucleus and activates transcription of
target genes such as fatty acid synthase and
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA), which is the rate-limiting
enzyme of the cholesterol biosynthetic mevalonate pathway. Moreover, SREBPs are also activated by the cellular RNA helicase DDX3X. It
was shown that the 30
UTR in the HCV RNA
genome binds to DDX3X, which acts as an intracellular sensor to activate a signaling cascade
that induces, via CBP-p300, the expression of
SREBP, which in turns activates the expression
of lipogenic genes (Li et al. 2013a). Finally, NS5B
was reported to bind to fatty acid synthase,
which activates the viral polymerase; however,
this activation appears to be mediated by direct
protein–protein interaction rather than by lipids
produced by the synthase (Huang et al. 2013).
Although these results illustrate the profound
effect of HCV on host cell lipid metabolism,
further studies are needed to clarify how distinct lipids contribute to or regulate viral RNA
replication.
CONCLUDING REMARKS
The plethora of studies focused on uncovering
the mechanisms of HCV RNA replication have
had a significant impact on both our basic understanding of these biological processes and in
the production of HCV-specific direct-acting
antiviral drugs. However, there remain many
unanswered questions in regard to these viral
processes, and addressing them will improve
our understanding of the basic principles of
HCV replication. Some of the key unresolved
topics in HCV replication are the mechanisms
driving RO biogenesis, the precise subcellular
location of viral RNA replication, the 3D architecture and functionality of the viral replicase
machinery, the mechanisms responsible for
governing the fate of newly synthesized viral
RNA, including the trafficking of this RNA between different viral compartments, the host cell
factors involved in HCV RNA replication, the
mechanism whereby NS5A exerts its multiplicity of functions, and how HCV replication intermediates are concealed from the immune response. A greater mechanistic understanding of
these processes will not only give insight into
HCV replication strategies but also will generate
knowledge that might be applicable to a large
range of human pathogens. For instance, all posHCV Replication

itive-strand RNA viruses induce the reorganization of cellular membranes, several of which,
including coronaviruses and picornaviruses, induce membrane structures similar to HCV (Paul
and Bartenschlager 2013; Neufeldt et al. 2018).
The similarity of these structures invites speculation that similar mechanisms are operating
with these viruses. Therefore, insights gained
from the study of HCV replication and membrane manipulation have the potential for application to related viruses and could lead to the
identification of novel strategies for development of broad-spectrum antivirals by targeting
host cell pathways and factors that are commonly used by these viruses. Moreover, the study of
how HCV interacts with its host to create an
environment conducive to replication has also
contributed to our understanding of basic cellular processes. Examples of this include important insights into polymerase or helicase structure and activity, cellular lipid metabolism and
the role of distinct lipids for robust viral replication, ER membrane dynamics, exploitation of
miRNAs to protect the viral genome from degradation and to alter RNA structure, and sensing
of viral RNA and viral countermeasures to suppress innate immunity. Thus, the combined research on HCV replication has had an enormous
impact on various fields, far beyond HCV itself.
Taking into account the excellent toolbox that
has been generated to study this virus, we can
expect that continued research of HCV–host cell
interaction will continue to make important discoveries with far-reaching implications.
