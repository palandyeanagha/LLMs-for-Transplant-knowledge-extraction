Abstract
Several international recommendations address the assessment of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) after hematopoietic cell
transplantation (HCT). This position statement by GvHD experts from the European Society for Blood and Marrow
Transplantation (EBMT), the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Center for International Blood and Marrow
Transplant Research (CIBMTR) reviews the existing guidelines for both acute and chronic GvHD, addresses potential
confusions that arise in daily practice and proposes consensus definitions for many key terms. We provide a historical
perspective on the currently available guidelines and recommend the Mount Sinai Acute GvHD International Consortium
(MAGIC) criteria for acute GvHD and the NIH 2014 criteria for chronic GvHD as the most comprehensive and detailed
criteria available. This statement also offers practical guidance for the implementation of these recommendations and a set of
consensus definitions for commonly used GvHD terms in order to facilitate future clinical and translational research. To
assist the dissemination of these recommendations, a web-application based on this position statement is available
(https://www.uzleuven.be/egvhd). We believe that adherence to a common set of GvHD assessment criteria is vitally
important to improve the quality of data, compare results of retrospective studies and prospective clinical trials, and make
therapeutic recommendations based on quality evidence.

tissues of the transplantation recipient. It is the most serious
complication of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Its recognition and control are key elements of
a successful outcome. In fact, the World Health Organization stipulates that data collection and data analysis are
integral parts of therapy [1].
In practice, however, the application of basic concepts
pertaining to the diagnosis and staging of this condition
differs widely among HCT clinicians. The use of the templated data collection forms (such as those used by the
Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant
Research (CIBMTR), the European Society for Blood and
Marrow Transplantation (EBMT), and the National Institutes
of Health/National Cancer Institute (NIH/NCI)) improves
standardization by collecting data elements as proposed by
published consensus documents but demands significant
time from healthcare professionals and researchers.
Several studies have shown a lack of adherence to
recommendations and inconsistencies in GvHD evaluation
[2–9]. Weisdorf et al. showed in one multi-center study that
acute GvHD (aGvHD) grading at HCT centers significantly
underestimated disease severity compared to a central,
expert review board, with inaccurate evaluation of grade III
GvHD in 18% of cases [7]. In a recent chronic GvHD
(cGvHD) intervention trial, up to 10% of patients entered by
GvHD Consortium centers were excluded from study analysis post hoc due to failure to meet diagnostic criteria at the
time of inclusion [8].
Such discrepancies are concerning because they can
significantly affect the interpretation of GvHD data in
clinical trials. Misclassifications have been observed even
among experienced HCT and GvHD professionals, and
inaccuracies are therefore likely to be even more prominent
among less experienced centers. In fact, a recent survey of
practice patterns completed by transplant professionals
during the annual 2017 EBMT conference showed wide
variations in the types of reference guidelines used for
GvHD assessments, and up to one third of the survey participants reported a lack of confidence in their ability to
apply these guidelines [9]. Of interest, the GvHD assessments of two clinical vignettes became much more consistent and compliant with recent international guidelines
when the same cases were evaluated using an electronic
tool, the eGvHD App [9] (available at https://www.
uzleuven.be/egvhd).
The use of electronic tools to streamline and increase the
reliability of the GvHD evaluation process has been advocated by several groups [4, 9–12], but such tools require a
clear and broad consensus regarding reference guidelines to
guarantee their internal validity. GvHD experts from the
EBMT, NIH, and CIBMTR have therefore joined forces to:
(1) review the existing guidelines for both acute and chronic
GvHD and recommend those best supported by clinical
evidence; (2) address confusions that arise in real-life scenarios encountered in clinical practice; and (3) develop
consensus definitions for key terms frequently used in the
evaluation and monitoring of GvHD. All three issues were
addressed during a series of conference calls and manuscript
draft reviews between May and October 2017. The mission
of this effort is to advance GvHD research through a
transparent and unbiased standardization of common elements in GvHD terminology, thereby increasing the quality
and precision of the data collected in HCT clinical research
and practice.
Issue 1: Standardized assessments of GvHD:
a historical perspective
Acute GvHD definition
Acute GvHD refers to the appearance of an allogeneic
inflammatory response in exclusively three organs: the skin
(inflammatory maculopapular erythematous skin rash), the
liver (hyperbilirubinemia due to cholestatic jaundice), and
the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract (upper and/or lower GI tract
manifestations: anorexia with weight loss, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, severe pain, GI bleeding and/or ileus)
[13–16]. The diagnosis must occur in the absence of manifestations of cGvHD [17, 18] (Fig. 1a) and should ideally
be supported by positive histological findings, but this is not
strictly necessary if no alternative etiology is present.
The Glucksberg aGvHD classification was first proposed
in the 1970s based on a cohort of 60 patients evaluated for
aGvHD after myeloablative conditioning. This classification
staged skin, lower gastrointestinal tract and liver, each on a
scale of 0 (absent) to 4 (severe) points (Table 1), to create a
final overall grade of I (mild) to IV (life-threatening) [13].
The overall aGvHD grade typically corresponds to the
highest grade conferred by the individual staging of each
organ, as described in Table 2. Approximately 20 years
later, the Keystone aGvHD consensus panel reviewed the
outcome of the Glucksberg classification in almost 6000
patients and confirmed the predictive value of maximum
aGvHD grade for day 100 mortality [14]. Three major
recommendations that resulted from that review were: (1)
upper GI tract manifestations, in the presence of a positive
biopsy, should be classified as overall grade II aGvHD; (2)
GI stage 4 should be based on severe symptoms such as
severe pain, bleeding and/or ileus and not diarrhea volume;
and (3) functional status should be eliminated as an element
of overall grade because of its non-specific and multifactorial etiology. In parallel, the CIBMTR proposed the
IBMTR aGvHD classification: this alternative algorithm
was based on similar raw organ staging (Table 1) and
resulted in a final grade of A−D (Table 2), which provided
1402 H. M. Schoemans et al.

a slightly more accurate prediction of mortality [15].
Recently, MacMillan and colleagues published a further
adaptation of the Keystone consensus criteria: the Minnesota aGvHD grading, which limited overall grade IV
aGvHD to skin and gut stage four, instead of skin and liver
stage four as described in the Keystone criteria [19]
(Table 2). In this study, no particular grading system was
superior in predicting survival. The availability of these
different options to assess aGvHD can give rise to controversy when healthcare professionals do not clearly define
which grading system is used.
Most recently, the Mount Sinai Acute GvHD International Consortium (MAGIC) has revisited these criteria
based on a review of their extensive database containing
detailed clinical information on aGvHD, and recommended
more precise definitions for grade IV aGvHD [16].

Specifically, stage 4 cutaneous involvement requires the
presence of ulcerations or bullous formations on a minimum
of 5% of the body surface area. Stage 4 lower GI aGvHD is
also considered an overall grade of IV, better reflecting its
dismal prognosis [20]. Guidance for the classification of GI
involvement is given with thresholds for both upper GI
(based on a minimum number of precisely defined symptoms, with or without a positive biopsy) and lower GI tract
(based on the number of liquid stool episodes and/or average volume per episode) (Table 1). The MAGIC criteria are
actively used by several international consortia (the BMT
Clinical Trials Network and the Children’s Oncology
Group) and in biomarker development research. In the
opinion of this panel, the MAGIC criteria are considered the
most current and detailed criteria to diagnose and score the
severity of aGvHD, especially for the clarity of what constitutes clinically significant upper GI symptoms and stage
4 skin and GI involvement. It should be noted that there is
little difference anticipated between the MAGIC and modified Glucksberg criteria when grades III and IV are combined for analysis. The changes in the definition of upper GI
GVHD could affect assignment to overall grades I or II.
Of note, the MAGIC group also introduced the concept
of diagnostic confidence levels for acute GvHD:
“confirmed”, “probable”, “possible” and “negative” correlating with histological confirmation, initiation of treatment,
resolution without therapeutic intervention, and definitive
alternative histologic diagnosis, respectively. Further prospective validation of the confidence categories is underway
to formally assess their predictive value and reliability.
Chronic GvHD definition
Chronic GvHD was originally defined in the early 1980s in
a cohort of 20 Seattle patients, as any GvHD present beyond
day 100. cGvHD severity was categorized as “limited”
(localized skin lesions with or without limited hepatic
involvement) or “extensive” (generalized skin involvement,
major hepatic complications, or involvement of any other
organ) [21]. 20 years later, a survey of transplant professionals’ responses to clinical cGvHD vignettes demonstrated wide variations in scoring practices [3] and led to a
refinement of the original Seattle criteria (Table 3) [22].
In 2005, the first NIH “expert-opinion” consensus conference for cGvHD defined precise criteria for the diagnosis
and staging of individual organ severity, based on functional disability, and eliminated the requirement that all
GvHD occurring after day 100 be considered cGvHD [17].
The conference proposed that the diagnosis of cGvHD rely
on either specific diagnostic signs or other distinctive signs
accompanied by additional confirmation (e.g. biopsy or
other objective diagnostic test) in at least one target organ
(skin and appendages, mouth, eyes, genitalia, esophagus,
lungs and muscles and fascia). The “overlap cGvHD subtype” was defined by the diagnosis of cGvHD together with
acute GvHD manifestations of the skin, liver or gut
(Fig. 1a). The severity of cGvHD (either classic or overlap)
was scored by patient symptoms as well as functional organ
impairment, ranging from 0 (absent) to 3 (severe) for each
involved organ. A final global severity score for cGvHD is
“mild” when a maximum of two organs are scored 1,

“severe” if any organ is scored 3, and “moderate” for all
other combinations. Lungs provide the single exception to
this rule, where a lung score of 1 results in a global score of
“moderate”, and a lung score of 2 results in an overall
“severe” score because of the potential irreversibility of
pulmonary lesions and the poor prognosis for patients so
affected [23, 24].
In 2014, a second NIH consensus conference revisited
and updated these criteria based on the evidence generated
during the intervening decade [18]. One major recommendation was to eliminate from the severity score any
dysfunction unequivocally caused by an alternative
etiology. Several further refinements to single organ staging were also recommended. In the opinion of this task
force, the NIH 2014 criteria are the most accurate and
widely accepted standard for the diagnosis and scoring of
cGvHD.
Issue 2: Application to clinical practice
Because the above-mentioned guidelines were developed
for research purposes, their application to “real-life” scenarios can be quite challenging for healthcare professionals.
This section offers guidance for the application of these
international standards in clinical practice.
Assessment of the global severity of GvHD
The patient’s global severity assessment (overall grade)
evaluates exclusively three organs for aGvHD (skin, liver,
and GI tract) and eight organs for cGvHD (skin, mouth,
eyes, GI tract, liver, lungs, muscles/joints/fascia and genitals), based on the highest score of organ involvement
as described above (Tables 2 and 3). No other abnormalities
have an impact on the global severity scoring. The patient’s
functional status is documented by Karnofsky−Lansky
scores, but it does not contribute to the overall score of
either acute [14–16, 19] or chronic GvHD [17, 18]. Similarly, “undefined other” cGvHD manifestations or the
“opinion of the evaluator” should be recorded but should
not have an impact on the final global score [18].
Multiple causes of organ impairment
For both acute and chronic GvHD, a given organ is not
considered in the overall GvHD grade if the manifestation is
solely due to a non-GvHD cause (e.g. zoster skin infection,

1406 H. M. Schoemans et al.

chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, steroid myopathy,
etc...). In the case of both GvHD and concomitant nonGvHD etiologies, it is useful to document the non-GvHD
causes but there is currently no justification to downgrade
an organ score due to concurrent additional causes (e.g.
simultaneous liver GvHD and veno-occlusive disease)
[18, 25].
Organ-specific issues
Acute GvHD typically only involves three organs: the skin,
the liver, and the GI tract [16]. Alloimmune manifestations
in other organs are to be linked to chronic GvHD (Fig. 1a)
[18]. For instance, oral GvHD with lichen planus-like
changes is always considered to be a chronic manifestation
even if it appears in the early post-transplantation phase
(where it needs to be differentiated from alternative etiologies). Obstructive lung manifestations are also always
considered to be chronic features, provided they are either
confirmed by biopsy or meet strict diagnostic criteria and
are accompanied by at least one diagnostic or distinctive
manifestation of cGvHD elsewhere [18].
Some patients have atypical signs and symptoms that
might be considered cGvHD but fall outside of the current
diagnostic, staging and response criteria [18, 27]. Such
manifestations of potential alloreactivity (e.g. ascites, serositis, nephrotic syndrome, membranous glomerulopathy,
myasthenia gravis, peripheral neuropathy, polymyositis,
weight loss in the absence of GI symptoms, Raynaud’s
phenomenon, cardiac involvement, eosinophilia, decreased
platelet counts, thyroid disorders, etc...) [18] can occur at
any time after transplantation. If attributed by the treating
physician to cGvHD, they should be categorized as
“undefined other cGvHD” (Fig. 1a). This category may
represent 10–15% of patients (Kirk Shultz, personal
communication). Capturing these data in prospective
cohorts is recommended to understand the full spectrum
and true incidence of immunological complications after
HCT, especially when such manifestations drive management decisions (e.g. the treating physician alters immunosuppression suspecting a link with cGvHD). All
manifestations treated as cGvHD should thus be documented, irrespective of whether they meet NIH diagnostic
criteria, provided that their “undefined other” nature is
clearly noted.
Similarly, isolated increase of transaminases is relatively
common during the taper of immunosuppression or after
donor lymphocyte infusions. This increase should also be
assigned to the “undefined other cGvHD” group, provided it
is treated as GvHD in the absence of meeting NIH diagnostic criteria and no histopathological confirmation of liver
GvHD has been obtained. Because of their invasive character, liver biopsies are rarely performed and the nature of
hepatic enzyme disturbances remains therefore uncertain.
This further emphasizes the need for prospective recording
of such abnormalities [28].
Overlap chronic GvHD
Overlap cGvHD is a subtype of cGvHD which has been
associated with a poor prognosis [29, 30]. It is characterized
by the simultaneous presence of acute and chronic GvHD
features (Fig. 1a). Chronic GvHD that is accompanied by
acute GI manifestations (anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, GI bleeding, and/or ileus) is
categorized as overlap cGvHD [17, 18]. However, skin
manifestations of aGvHD (maculopapular erythematous
rash) can be difficult to differentiate from those of cGvHD.
Similarly, the elevation of bilirubin (often accompanied by
elevated hepatic enzymes) suggests involvement of the
liver, but cannot be unequivocally attributable to either an
acute or a chronic process. Given these uncertainties, we
currently recommend systematic documentation of aGvHD
manifestations (in any organ) and subclassification of such
cases as overlap cGvHD, while awaiting future “biologybased” classifications.
Specific guidance for the assessment of chronic
GvHD
Skin, muscle, and fascia involvement
In cGvHD, MRI can sometimes be a useful tool to detect
fascia involvement [31], yet distinguishing between skin
and muscle/fascia fibrosis as the cause of functional
impairment is frequently challenging. Once movement is
impaired, muscles and fascia are generally involved and are
almost always associated with sclerotic skin GvHD [32].
Therefore, skin and fascia involvement should then be
documented, even if skin involvement is the primary
manifestation. Furthermore, although photographic-range of
motion (P-ROM) ratings have been recognized as a sensitive way to capture fascia involvement and response to
treatment [33], they cannot be directly translated into
severity scores of joints-fascia involvement [18]. Finally,
muscle cramps are frequently reported by GvHD patients
but are not specific and are not included in the severity
score.
Scheduling pulmonary function tests and genital exams
Clinical practice rarely allows time and resources for an
exhaustive patient evaluation of cGvHD at every visit. For
example, pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and genital
examinations typically require third-party input, which can
be challenging to obtain on the same day.
EBMT−NIH−CIBMTR Task Force position statement on GvHD terminology 1407

Although both the dyspnea and lung function scores
should ideally be recorded, PFTs are the best way to
describe lung involvement and should be obtained at
diagnosis of GvHD and then minimally every 3–6 months
thereafter in patients on systemic therapy for active cGvHD
[34, 35]. However, if recent (maximum 3–6 months old)
PFTs are missing, we recommend that symptomatic dyspnea score be used for scoring [18] until updated PFTs are
available. Documentation should ideally allow tracing of
which source of information (symptoms or PFTs) was used,
to allow for meaningful comparisons over time.
A formal genital exam or inspection should ideally be
performed at diagnosis and at every GvHD evaluation
thereafter in patients with active cGvHD. In clinical practice, this is not always feasible; therefore, we recommend
this exam be performed within 3 months of cGvHD

diagnosis followed by a regular follow-up every
9−12 months [35, 36]. At other time points, a genital exam
is recommended when a patient reports specific discomfort
or new lesions in the genital area.
Of note, both pulmonary and urogenital complications
can go undetected if not specifically queried, with potentially dramatic clinical consequences [23, 24, 37–39].
Patients should be asked about symptoms and functional
impairments at every visit, since early recognition of these
complications can often be addressed with relatively simple
therapeutic measures, including local or limited systemic
immunosuppressive treatment [36, 40, 41].
Controversies in chronic GvHD
In spite of the extensive harmonization effort of the cGvHD
NIH consortium, some criteria would benefit from further
clarification. For instance, weight loss is categorized based
on the percentage decrease of bodyweight occurring over a
3-month period [18]. It is unclear how to classify patients
who lose a significant amount of weight initially but have
stabilized by the time of evaluation. For now, we recommend to limit the impact of weight loss on severity scoring
to the last 3 months preceding the GvHD assessment time
point. Another controversial issue is the use of therapeutic
measures to define severity (e.g. the placement of punctal
plugs for severely dry eyes [18, 27], the use of specific eye
ware to relieve pain [18, 27] or the dilatation of esophageal
stenosis [18]). Given the lack of empirical data, clarification
of these issues will require consensus and validation efforts
in the future. In the meantime, we recommend to track
therapeutic interventions and specify in clinical protocols
and/or standard operating procedures whether the severity
score considers treatments/procedures ever received or
within a specific timeframe.
Pediatric considerations
Three primary areas differ in the pediatric population with
regards to GvHD assessment: (1) some criteria used in
adults are difficult to apply in young children (e.g. PFTs and
Schirmer’s test for children under the age of 6 [18]); (2) the
incidence of cGvHD appears lower in children [42, 43];
and (3) approximately 50% of pediatric transplants are
performed for nonmalignant disorders, where tissue repair
defects that may impact development of GvHD are more
common (e.g. increase of aGvHD in Fanconi Anemia
patients [44]).
Currently, the only organs with specific pediatric modifications recommendations for GvHD assessment are: (1)
adapted body surface area maps for skin involvement; (2)
appropriate reference values for lung function; and (3)
weight-adapted measures for diarrhea [16, 18]. Moreover,
as PFTs are unreliable for children under the age of 6 years,
diagnosis and scoring of lung GvHD relies instead on
clinical evaluation, imaging, and lung biopsy [18]. The high
frequency of usually transient viral erythema, which can be
mistaken for manifestations of aGvHD, is another issue in
children. There is thus clearly an unmet need for developing
pediatric population-adapted GvHD symptom scales and
assessments [45].
Issue 3: A standardized GvHD terminology
In clinical practice, GvHD presentations can range from a
rapidly progressive extensive inflammatory syndrome
requiring immediate and aggressive systemic immune suppression, to purely fibrotic, cicatricial manifestations with
fixed deficits that are unlikely to respond quickly or completely resolve with therapy [26]. Between these extremes,
the large spectrum of presentations, occurring in the context
of a wide variety in GvHD prevention and treatment regimens, is more challenging to describe. Many of the terms
frequently used to communicate with patients and colleagues lack clear, broadly accepted definitions. We propose
here several definitions for a standardized GvHD terminology in order to facilitate future research and allow more
accurate comparisons among studies (Table 4).
GvHD activity
In the setting of clinical trials, response to treatment compares disease burden at specific points in time, usually with
regards to a particular treatment. It is based on a number of
clinical findings, sometimes including fixed deficits. Classical categories of response are complete response (CR),
partial response (PR), and lack of response (which includes
no change, mixed response and progression), as established
by the NIH consortium for chronic GvHD [27]. For acute
GvHD, similar criteria have been described by the MAGIC
consortium [46].
However, GvHD activity may be distinct from response
if the disease burden includes fixed deficits that are no
longer responsive to treatment. Identification of such deficits can be difficult but is essential to the accurate
description of complex clinical phenotypes, particularly in
cGvHD. Determination of GvHD activity is often the
principal driver in therapeutic decisions (e.g. intensification,
reduction (taper) or discontinuation of immunosuppression)
and is likely to be critical for biomarker validation.
We therefore propose a classification of GvHD activity
that incorporates both the presence of disease manifestations and the use of immunosuppression, consistent with
the NIH Consensus task force model of GvHD physiopathology [26].
EBMT−NIH−CIBMTR Task Force position statement on GvHD terminology 1409

GvHD is considered “clinically active” if the patient has
inflammatory or worsening manifestations (either acute or
chronic) regardless of the use of immunosuppressive therapy. After the inflammation resolves, GvHD manifestations
can either disappear without residua or fixed deficits may
remain. Such fixed or irreversible deficits represent scars in
the affected organ due to either permanent damage or
aberrant tissue repair (e.g. skin color change, stable fibrotic
features, sicca syndrome) that persist regardless of immunosuppressive treatment [26].
Once all signs of clinical activity have disappeared,
GvHD activity can be described in three different ways. If
immunosuppression is still ongoing or has been discontinued for less than 12 weeks [26] or 24 weeks [47] for
acute and chronic GvHD respectively, GvHD activity can
be considered “controlled” regardless of the presence of
fixed sequelae. If immunosuppression has been discontinued for more than the above mentionned periods of
time without recurrence of inflammatory signs, GvHD is
termed “resolved” if there are no fixed deficits and “inactive” if such fixed deficits persist.
GvHD onset
GvHD onset refers to the presentation of the first episode of
clinically evident alloreactivity of the donor against the
recipient host (Fig. 1b, c).
“Classic acute GvHD” refers to the initial diagnosis of
acute GvHD within the first 100 days following transplantation or DLI infusion (whichever happened last) [17].
“Late acute GvHD” occurs beyond day 100 and can be:
“late onset” (new onset of aGvHD with no prior history of
classic aGvHD), “recurrent onset” (recurrence of aGvHD in
a patient with prior history of classic aGvHD whose
symptoms became controlled, inactive or resolved); or
“persistent” if active aGvHD signs persist beyond day 100
in the absence of cGvHD manifestations [17].
Chronic GvHD is referred to as having “de novo onset”
if cGvHD is diagnosed [18] for the first time in a patient
who did not previously experience acute GvHD [17, 18].
“Quiescent onset” is defined as cGvHD that appears for the
first time after all acute GvHD manifestations have become
controlled, inactive or resolved [17, 18]. “Progressive
onset” refers exclusively to the initial presentation of
cGvHD manifestations while acute GvHD symptoms are
still active [17, 18]. It is therefore always a form of overlap
cGvHD (Fig. 1a), although not all overlap cGvHD syndromes present with a progressive onset. “Progressive
onset” is also distinct from “progression”, which is a
response criterion that refers to an increase in severity of
acute or chronic GvHD symptoms over time [27, 46].
“Progressive onset” cGvHD has been associated for over 30
years with inferior prognosis and poor response to treatment
[48–60]. Yet, it should be noted that because these studies
used a variety of definitions, some patients, who did not
present with new cGvHD manifestations, would now be
reclassified as “persistent late acute GvHD”. Interestingly,
Stewart et al. showed that after the dose of prednisone was
taken into account, “progressive onset” no longer predicted
long-term survival [60], suggesting that the level of chronic
immunosuppression at diagnosis influences the prognosis
for cGvHD with this type of onset.
There is currently no formal nomenclature to refer to the
pattern of GvHD recurrence after an initial diagnosis. The
term “flare” is sometimes used to define the reappearance or
worsening of any signs of GvHD. Although this might
reflect the natural course of the disease, this term currently
lacks a validated definition. For written scientific communications, we recommend instead the precise terminology
that refers to disease onset [17] or the classical clinical trial
response criteria [27], as appropriate.
Response to steroids
Acute GvHD steroid refractoriness or resistance is most
often referred to as either (1) progression in any organ within
3 [61–71], 4 [72–76], or 5 [77–79] days of therapy onset
with ≥2 mg/kg/day [61–63, 69–71, 73, 74, 76–78, 80–84] of
prednisone equivalent, (2) failure to improve within 5 [67] to
7 [61, 62, 64–66, 68, 69, 72, 74–76, 78, 80, 81, 83] days of
treatment initiation [71, 79, 85] or (3) incomplete response
after more than 28 days of immunosuppressive treatment
including steroids [46]. For the determination of eligibility in
prospective clinical trials, alternative definitions for aGvHD
steroid refractoriness may include other aspects such as:
incomplete response after 14 days of therapy [64–66, 75, 78,
79, 86] or use of an additional immunosuppressive agent
[86]. Chronic GvHD steroid refractoriness or resistance is
typically referred to as either: (1) progression of GvHD
while on prednisone at ≥1 mg/kg/day for 1 [87] to 2 [88]
weeks; or (2) stable GvHD on ≥0.5 mg/kg/day (or 1 mg/kg
every other day) of prednisone for 1 [87, 89] to 2 months
[65, 88].
Steroid dependence has been defined for aGvHD as the
inability to taper prednisone under 2 mg/kg/day after an
initially successful treatment of at least 7 days [74, 80, 81] or
as the recurrence of aGvHD activity during steroid taper [68,
79]. The relevance of this term was shown by Martin and
colleagues who demonstrated that the highest CR rates with
secondary therapy were seen when aGvHD recurred during
the taper phase of the primary glucocorticoid treatment,
thereby distinguishing it from steroid refractory aGvHD [90].
In cGvHD, steroid dependence refers to the inability to
control GvHD symptoms while tapering prednisone below
0.25 mg/kg/day (or 0.5 mg/kg every other day) in at least two
individual attempts, separated by at least 8 weeks [87].
1410 H. M. Schoemans et al.

Finally, the term “steroid intolerance” has not been formally validated but refers to the emergence of unacceptable
toxicity (e.g. uncontrolled infections, avascular necrosis,
arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, myopathy, osteoporosis, etc.) attributed to corticosteroids, as evaluated by a
healthcare professional [91, 92].
Conclusions
This report stresses the critical importance of a common,
international approach to describe the variety of GvHD
clinical manifestations observed after HCT. In the era of
electronic patient records and e-health applications, it is
possible to apply complex algorithms at the bedside and
follow internationally vetted guidelines in daily clinical
practice. Several efforts in this direction [4, 9–12], such as the
eGVHD app (available at https://www.uzleuven.be/egvhd),
are already developing more standardized and accurate
methods to capture “real-world” GvHD data. This progress
underlines the responsibility of transplantation societies to
help clarify definitions, to facilitate comparisons of clinical
research results and to set standards for clinical practice.
This task force panel advocates the use of the MAGIC
criteria for aGvHD and the NIH 2014 criteria for cGvHD as
the most comprehensive and detailed criteria currently
available. In addition, this statement provides consensus
definitions for a lexicon of commonly used GvHD terms
and concepts in order to facilitate GvHD clinical research.
The standardization of GvHD assessments should be a
dynamic process that can incorporate progress in new
diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Even as refined
classifications improve communication among clinicians,
they should also be prospectively evaluated for their predictive potential. Furthermore, in the absence of any
pathognomonic signs or test for GvHD, subjective elements
remain an integral part of the final clinical assessment. As
prospective biomarkers that detect underlying GvHD
pathophysiology are validated, they may assist clinicians by
offering objective laboratory metrics in addition to clinical
GvHD manifestations. But the formal validation of these
markers requires accurate and reliable clinical assessment of
GvHD severity in all organs.
We hope that this position statement will serve as the
cornerstone of a larger scale consensus project. Consistent
adherence to common sets of criteria, such as those
endorsed here, will help the transplantation community to
improve the quality of data capture across all types of
GvHD manifestations and therapeutic strategies. Harmonization of standards for the accurate assessment of GvHD is
an essential prerequisite for the formulation of recommendations [85, 93] regarding GvHD prophylaxis and treatment
that are based on quality evidence.
