Abstract
Background: Sorafenib induces frequent dose limiting toxicities (DLT) in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC). Sarcopenia has been associated with poor performance status and shortened survival in cancer patients.
Patients and Methods: The characteristics of Child Pugh A cirrhotic patients with HCC receiving sorafenib in our institution
were retrospectively analyzed. Sorafenib plasma concentrations were determined at each visit. Toxicities were recorded
during the first month of treatment, and sarcopenia was determined from baseline CT-scans.
Results: Forty patients (30 males) were included. Eleven (27.5%) were sarcopenic. Eighteen patients (45%) experienced a
DLT during the first month of treatment. Sarcopenic patients experienced significantly more DLTs than non-sarcopenic
patients did (82% versus 31%, p = 0.005). Grade 3 diarrhea was significantly more frequent in sarcopenic patients than in
non-sarcopenic patients (45.5% versus 6.9%, p = 0.01), but not grade 3 hand foot syndrome reaction (9% versus 17.2%,
p = 1). On day 28, median sorafenib AUC (n = 17) was significantly higher in sarcopenic patients (102.4 mg/l.h versus
53.7 mg/l.h, p = 0.013).
Conclusions: Among cirrhotic Child Pugh A patients with advanced HCC, sarcopenia predicts sorafenib exposure and the
occurrence of DLT within the first month of treatment.

Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for more than
24,000 new cases per year in the United States, and causes
approximately 19,000 deaths yearly [1]. The incidence of HCC is
increasing in Western countries, and HCC is diagnosed at
advanced stages in up to 60% of all patients [2].
Sorafenib (Nexavar; Bayer Healthcare, Wayne, NJ) is an orally
active multi–kinase inhibitor that targets BRAF, RET, PDGFR-b,
VEGFR-1, and VEGFR-2 [3]. At a dose of 400 mg bid, sorafenib
displays clinical activity in patients with advanced HCC [4].
Sorafenib-induced toxicities (diarrhea, hand-foot syndrome, rash,
fatigue and hypertension) may limit patient’s ability to receive fulldose treatment, and resulted in dose reductions in 26% and
treatment termination in 44% of patients included in the pivotal
phase III trial [4].
Little is known on factors predicting sorafenib toxicity.
Recently, the condition of low muscle mass named sarcopenia
[5,6] was identified as a significant predictor of toxicity in patients
with metastatic renal cancer treated with sorafenib 400 mg bid
[7]. Sarcopenia has been studied mainly in geriatric populations
[5], but also more recently in cancer patients, in whom sex-specific
cut-offs were determined, based on mortality risks [8]. Sarcopenia
and overall lean body mass may represent an occult condition in
cancer patients with normal or even high body mass index (BMI).
Sarcopenia has been associated with poor PS, capecitabine and
epirubicin toxicity, and shortened survival in cancer patients
[8,9,10].
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 May 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 5 | e37563

The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether
sarcopenia could predict the occurrence of early dose-limiting
toxicities (DLT) in HCC patients treated with sorafenib. We
hypothesized that an increased toxicity, as well as a higher drug
exposure, would be observed in sarcopenic HCC patients.
Materials and Methods
Participants
We performed a retrospective electronical medical record
review of consecutive patients with advanced HCC treated with
sorafenib in our institution from June 2007 to December 2010.
From October 2008, a population pharmacokinetics study
including patients receiving sorafenib for various malignancies
was initiated [11]. The pharmacokinetic data of patients with
HCC were extracted for the present study.
Ethics
All patients provided written informed consent, and the study
was approved by the local ethics board according to good clinical
practice and applicable laws, and the declaration of Helsinki.
Treatment, toxicity and activity assessment
Adult patients with HCC received sorafenib at a starting dose of
200 mg bid or 400 mg bid according to their ECOG PS and comorbidities, at the discretion of the treating physician, as described
by other authors [12]. Patients were treated in an outpatient setting,
and toxicity was assessed at visits on days 14 and 28 after the
initiation of sorafenib (or before if clinically indicated), then monthly.
Sorafenib dose was reduced to 200 mg bid in the case of severe
toxicity (grade 3 or 4 toxicity according to the NCI-CTC v3.0),
except for patients with grade 3 hypertension in whom antihypertensive drugs were introduced according to current guidelines [13]. If toxicity was not thereby resolved, treatment was
terminated, and if so, patients were returned to the initially
scheduled dose.
A DLT was defined as any toxicity leading to dose reduction,
temporary or permanent or discontinuation of treatment. Following the design of a previous study [9], only DLTs occurring during
the first month of treatment were examined for the present
analysis (Figure 1).
Treatment activity was assessed every three months by CTscan, or before if clinically indicated, according to RECIST v1.0.
Patients’ characteristics are described in Table 1. Patients
presented with a broad range of LBM. Therefore, the administered dose of sorafenib was markedly variable when expressed per
kg of LBM, ranging from 3.8 to 16.8 mg/kg LBM bid. Eleven
(27.5%) of 40 patients had sarcopenia (10 men and 1 woman).
Anthropometric measurements
Weight was measured with a medical balance beam scale and
height was measured with a stadiometer. Body mass index (BMI)
was calculated [weight (kg)/height (m2
)] and the World Health
Organization (WHO) categories were used: underweight,
BMI,18.5; normal, 18.5,BMI,24.9; overweight,
25,BMI,29.9; obesity, BMI.30. Body surface area (BSA) was
calculated using the Mosteller formula: body-surface area
(m2
) = ([height (cm)6weight (kg)]/3600)1/2.
Image analysis
Body composition was evaluated using CT-scan, as previously
described [14,15]. Regional adipose tissues (visceral and
subcutaneous) and muscle tissues were assessed on CT images,
which had been performed for diagnostic and follow-up
purposes. Images taken within 30 days before initiation of
sorafenib were included (Figure 1). Images were analyzed using
ImageJ software v1.42q (National Institutes of Health, http://
rsb.info.nih.gov/ij).
The third lumbar vertebra (L3) was chosen as a standard
landmark, as previously described [7]. Muscles were identified
based on their anatomic features, and the structure of those
specific muscles were quantified based on pre-established thresholds of Hounsfield units (229 to +150) of skeletal muscle tissue
[15]. Cross-sectional areas (cm2
) of the sum of all of these muscles
were computed for each image, and the mean value for two
consecutive images was computed for each patient.
Total lumbar skeletal muscle cross-sectional area (cm2
) and total
lumbar adipose tissue area (cm2
), are linearly related to wholebody muscle and adipose tissue mass [16,17]. These values were
normalized for stature as is conventional for BMI and body
composition components [8,16] and expressed in units of cm2
/m2.
The sex-specific cut-offs for sarcopenia [8] determined in patients
with digestive malignancies (55.4 cm2
/m2 for males and
38.9 cm2
/m2 for females) were used.
Total lean body mass (LBM) was estimated from muscle crosssectional areas as described by Mourtzakis et al. [16]: LBM
(kg) = 0.306[skeletal muscle at L3 using CT (cm2
)]+6.06.
Pharmacokinetic measurements
On each visit, blood samples were drawn to determine sorafenib
plasma concentrations. Sorafenib concentration determination
was conducted using a previously described high-performance
liquid chromatography method [18]. The accuracy, within-assay
and between assay precision of this method were 96.9–104.0%,
3.4–6.2% and 7.6–9.9%, respectively. A specific bayesian estimator developed in our institution [11] allowed estimating individual
sorafenib area under the plasma concentration–time curve from 0
to 12 hours (AUC). A 1-compartment model with saturated
absorption, first-order intestinal loss and linear elimination was
implemented in the ADAPT II software package, then used to
estimate sorafenib exposure (AUC).
Statistical analysis
Prevalence of toxicity was compared by Fisher’s exact test. The
Wilcoxon test was used for comparison of continuous variables,
and the Mann-Whitney U-test was used for comparisons between
AUCs. AUCs were normalized to a dose of 400 mg sorafenib
twice daily to investigate their relation with BMI, LBM or adipose
index. Dose-standardized AUCs were also used to compare the
drug exposition between non- and sarcopenic patients. The impact
of baseline parameters, including sarcopenia, on the occurrence of
DLT during the first month of treatment was evaluated by
Figure 1. Study timelines.

multiple regression with 3000 bootstrap iterations. All p values
were two-sided, and the level of significance was p,0.05.
Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were
measured from the date of first treatment administration to the
date of disease progression or death for the former, and the date
of death for the latter. Kaplan-Meier estimates of the
distribution of times from baseline to outcome were computed,
and the groups were compared using the log-rank test.
Calculations were performed with NCSSTM 2007 software
(NCSS, Kaysville, UT).
Results
Patients
Among 45 patients received sorafenib for advanced HCC from
June 2007 to December 2010, 42 had computerized tomography
(CT) images that met criteria for analysis. Three patients were
excluded from the investigation because they had either no CT
scans on record (n = 2), or a CT scan .30 days from treatment
initiation (n = 1). Finally, two additional patients with Child B
cirrhosis were also excluded. Overall, 40 patients with advanced
HCC and Child A cirrhosis were selected for the present analysis
(Figure 2), and AUCs on day 28 were available for 17 (43%)
patients.
Sorafenib toxicity
Eighteen patients (45%) experienced a DLT during the first
month of treatment (Table 2). The dose was reduced to 200 mg
bid for the 12 patients who had been started on sorafenib at a dose
of 400 mg bid. In the remaining 6 patients, who had been started
on sorafenib 200 mg bid, the treatment was discontinued.
DLTs included grade 3 diarrhea in 7 cases, grade 3 hand-foot
syndrome in 6 cases, and grade 4 upper GI bleeding in 1 case. The
remaining four patients had multiple, simultaneous grade 2
toxicities, with grade 3 fatigue. Grade 3 hypertension occurred
in 3 patients (all non-sarcopenic), but was not considered as doseTable 2. Comparisons between patients with and without sarcopenia.

limiting since it was controlled by the introduction of oral antihypertensive agents, without modification of sorafenib dosing.
The comparison between sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic
patients is summarized in Table 2. Six of 11 sarcopenic patients
had been started on sorafenib 200 mg bid, a higher proportion
than that observed in non-sarcopenic patients (54.5% vs. 17.2%,
p = 0.04). However, no difference was observed regarding
sorafenib dose/kg of LBM, age, height, weight, BMI and BSA.
As expected, significant differences in serum albumin, lumbar
skeletal muscle index and LBM were seen between sarcopenic and
non-sarcopenic patients.
Overall, patients with sarcopenia presented with a higher
prevalence of DLT (81.8% or 9/11) compared with nonsarcopenic patients (31.0% or 9/29, p = 0.005; Table 2,
Figure 3a). When considering each toxicity separately, only grade
3 diarrhea was significantly more prevalent in sarcopenic patients
(5/11 patients or 45.5% vs. 2/29 patients or 6.9%, p = 0.01,
Figure 3b). No significant difference was found for other toxicities,
especially hand-foot skin reaction (Figure 3c). By multivariate
analysis, only sarcopenia was an independently correlated with the
occurrence of DLT (p = 0.03).
Sorafenib pharmacokinetics
The median calculated dose-adjusted AUC on day 28 was
higher in sarcopenic patients than in non-sarcopenic patients
(median: 102.4 mg/l.h, range: 48.0–137.8 vs. 53.7 mg/l.h, range:
24.5–74.5, respectively, p = 0.013, Figure 3d). No correlation was
found between AUC and BMI, LBM or adipose index (p = 0.34,
0.11 and 0.23, respectively). Patients who experienced a DLT
during the first 28 days of treatment had higher AUCs on day 28
(median: 106.4 mg/l.h, range 48–177.8 vs 56.7 mg/l.h, range
24.5–136.7), although this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.09). As well, no statistical difference was found between
AUC on day 28 in patients with or without grade 3 diarrhea
(median: 102.4 mg/l.h, range 48–137.8 vs. 56.9 mg/l.h, range
24.5–136.7, respectively, p = 0.10).

Survival analysis
The median PFS and OS for the study population (n = 40) were
4.6 (95%CI: 2.5–7.7) and 8.9 months (95%CI: 7.4–16.5),
respectively. No significant differences were observed between
non-sarcopenic and sarcopenic patients regarding median PFS
[4.6 (95%CI: 2.5–7.7) vs. 2.5 months (95%CI: 1.3–16.1),
respectively, p = 0.94] and median OS [11.0 (95%CI: 7.7–16.5)
vs. 7.4 months (95%CI: 1.9–19.3), respectively, p = 0.28] (Figure
4).
Discussion
The present retrospective analysis is the first study evaluating
relationships between body composition and chemotherapy
toxicity and pharmacokinetics in patients with HCC. In a daily
practice population of 40 patients with HCC and Child A
cirrhosis, we found a proportion of 27.5% of patients with
sarcopenia, a proportion similar to that observed in other series
[19].
Sarcopenic patients received more frequently an initial dose of
sorafenib of 200 mg bid based on the clinical judgement of the
treating physician, a finding consistent with the knowledge that
sarcopenia has been associated with poor PS in cancer patients [8].
Interestingly, despite the apparent heterogeneity in sorafenib
dosing between sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic patients, the doses
of sorafenib/kg of LBM were identical in both groups.
During the first month of treatment, sarcopenic patients
experienced significantly more DLTs, mainly grade 3 diarrhea.
DLTs were frequent in our patients, probably because they
represents a daily practice population, more frail and more prone
to develop severe toxicity than patients treated in clinical trials.
Sarcopenic patients had higher sorafenib AUC on day 28 than
non-sarcopenic patients, but we found no significant correlation
between AUC and the occurrence of DLT or grade 3 diarrhea,
although a trend was observed (p = 0.09 and p = 0.10, respectively). This negative result may be due to the small number of
patients with pharmacokinetic data, since routine monitoring of
sorafenib plasma concentrations has recently started in our
institution. We therefore hypothesize that the ongoing collection
of pharmacokinetic data in our institution could allow the
demonstration of a relationship between increased exposure and
the occurrence of severe diarrhea. Of note, phase I trials have
failed to demonstrate a clear correlation between sorafenib
exposure and other toxicities [20].
Several hypotheses accounting for increased exposure and
increased toxicity in sarcopenic patients with HCC can be raised.
Firstly, sarcopenia might result in alterations in the distribution,
metabolism and clearance of anticancer drugs. Prado et al. [10]
have recently evidenced a critical role for LBM in the
pharmacokinetics of epirubicin. In line with Prado’s hypothesis
regarding epirubicin, it is of interest to underscore that sorafenib is
highly protein-bound (.99%, mainly to albumin). Binding might
also occur in lean body tissues, and not exclusively to serum
albumin. Hence, patients with sarcopenia would have high intratissular exposure to unbound sorafenib. A potential confounding
factor could be hypoalbuminemia, which was more prevalent in
sarcopenic patients in our study. The pharmacokinetics of
sorafenib in patients with low albuminemia remains unknown.
Miller et al. [21] investigated total and free sorafenib exposure in
cancer patients with varying degrees of hepatic dysfunction
receiving a single-dose of sorafenib 400 mg. In contradiction to
a priori hypothesis, sorafenib unbound fraction in a cohort
including patients with severe hypoalbuminemia (,25 g/L) were
not significantly different from those measured in the cohort with
normal hepatic function. However, the clinical relevance of this
study using a single-dose of sorafenib 400 mg is limited, because it
does not provide information on sorafenib pharmacokinetics and
toxicity when the steady-state has been reached. Hence, the
consequences of hypoalbuminemia in patients receiving sorafenib
remain to determine.
Secondly, Antoun et al. [7] found that sarcopenia and low BMI
could predict DLT (at any time during the treatment) in patients
with advanced renal cancer. The authors hypothesized that in
patients with low BMI and sarcopenia, sorafenib flat-dosing
(400 mg bid) could result in increased exposure, and thereby in
excessive toxicity. Our results confirm this hypothesis, although we
found no relationship between BMI and the occurrence of
sorafenib-induced DLT in patients with HCC. This may be due
to the fact that patients with Child-Pugh A cirrhosis might develop
lower limb oedema and mild ascites, leading to erroneously
normal calculated BMI. Antoun et al. [7] underscored that
sarcopenic patients have an increased propensity for nosocomial
infections and other complications in hospital [22], a possible
reflect of a global frailty that might include vulnerability to
sorafenib toxicity.
Thirdly, systemic inflammation underlies sarcopenia [6], and
might play a role in the occurrence of DLT. Indeed, inflammation
has a negative impact on the activity of CYP3A4 [23], one of the
enzymes involved in the metabolism of sorafenib. Hence,
sarcopenic patients with high baseline CRP levels could experience high exposure to sorafenib due to low CYP3A4 activity, and
subsequently excessive toxicity. In the present study, we found no
difference in baseline CRP levels between sarcopenic and nonsarcopenic patients. However, the impact of sarcopenia on
CYP3A4 activity deserves further investigations, including phenotypic and genotypic testing.
The limitations of the present study include its retrospective
nature and the small number of patients. Further prospective
studies including a PK/PD approach are needed to validate these
results in larger populations of patients. Our results also pinpoint
that the evaluation of LBM based on CT-scan analysis is worth
being investigated in patients treated with sorafenib, rather than
other clinical parameters such as body weight, BSA or BMI.
In conclusion, our results highlight the emerging role of
sarcopenia assessment to improve the anticipation of sorafenibrelated toxicities, opening gates to drug dosing individualization in
patients with advanced HCC. This concept warrants validation in
further prospective studies evaluating toxicity after drug dosing
based on pre-treatment evaluation of sarcopenia.
