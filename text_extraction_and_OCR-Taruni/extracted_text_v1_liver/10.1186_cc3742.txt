Abstract
Valproic acid (VPA) is a broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug and is
usually well tolerated, but rare serious complications may occur in
some patients receiving VPA chronically, including haemorrhagic
pancreatitis, bone marrow suppression, VPA-induced hepatotoxicity (VHT) and VPA-induced hyperammonaemic encephalopathy (VHE). Some data suggest that VHT and VHE may be
promoted by carnitine deficiency. Acute VPA intoxication also
occurs as a consequence of intentional or accidental overdose and
its incidence is increasing, because of use of VPA in psychiatric
disorders. Although it usually results in mild central nervous system
depression, serious toxicity and even fatal cases have been
reported. Several studies or isolated clinical observations have
suggested the potential value of oral L-carnitine in reversing
carnitine deficiency or preventing its development as well as some
adverse effects due to VPA. Carnitine supplementation during VPA
therapy in high-risk patients is now recommended by some
scientific committees and textbooks, especially paediatricians. Lcarnitine therapy could also be valuable in those patients who
develop VHT or VHE. A few isolated observations also suggest
that L-carnitine may be useful in patients with coma or in preventing
hepatic dysfunction after acute VPA overdose. However, these
issues deserve further investigation in controlled, randomized and
probably multicentre trials to evaluate the clinical value and the
appropriate dosage of L-carnitine in each of these conditions.
Introduction
Valproic acid (VPA) is a broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug
(AED) that has been used for more than 30 years and is
effective in the treatment of many different types of partial and
generalized epileptic seizure. It is also prescribed to treat
bipolar and schizoaffective disorders, social phobias and
neuropathic pain, as well as for prophylaxis or treatment of
migraine headache. VPA is a branched chain carboxylic acid
(2-propylpentanoic acid or di-n-propylacetic acid), with a
chemical structure very similar to that of short chain fatty
acids (Fig. 1) [1].
It is usually well tolerated. Indeed, VPA has fewer common
side effects than do other AEDs, especially on behaviour and
cognitive functions. Moreover, its adverse effects can often
be minimized by initiating the drug slowly. However, rare
serious complications may occur in some patients receiving
VPA chronically, including fatal haemorrhagic pancreatitis,
bone marrow suppression, VPA-induced hepatotoxicity (VHT)
and VPA-induced hyperammonaemic encephalopathy (VHE).
Some data suggest that VHT and VHE may be promoted
either by a pre-existing carnitine deficiency or by deficiency
induced by VPA per se.
Acute VPA intoxication also occurs as a consequence of
intentional or accidental overdose. Its incidence is increasing
[2-5], probably because of the use of VPA in psychiatric
disorders. It usually results in mild and self-limited central
nervous system (CNS) depression. However, serious toxicity
and even deaths have been reported [2,6,7].
This paper reviews clinical evidence concerning the use of
carnitine supplementation in the management of VHT, VHE
and acute VPA poisoning. The potential benefit of carnitine
supplementation in the prevention of VHT of VHE in the
setting of chronic VPA dosing is also briefly discussed.
Pharmacology of valproic acid
VPA potentiates γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic functions
in some specific brain regions that are thought to be involved
in the control of seizure generation and propagation by
increasing both GABA synthesis and release [8]. Furthermore, VPA reduces the release of the epileptogenic
γ-hydroxybutyric acid and attenuates the neuronal excitation
induced by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate
receptors [9]. Finally, VPA could also exert direct effects on
excitable membranes, and alter dopaminergic and serotoninergic neurotransmissions [10].

VPA is available as oral immediate-release, enteric-coated
and delayed-release preparations, and as an intravenous
formulation. Therapeutic daily doses range from 1 to 2 g in
adults, and from 15 to 60 mg/kg in children [11].
Non-enteric-coated preparations of VPA are rapidly and
nearly completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract,
with peak plasma concentrations occurring 1–4 hours after
ingestion [12]. Peak plasma concentrations occur only
4–5 hours after therapeutic doses of enteric-coated tablets.
Peak plasma concentrations may be markedly delayed
following acute overdose [11-14].
Therapeutic serum concentrations range from 50 to 125 µg/ml
[11,15]. At such therapeutic concentrations VPA is 80–90%
bound to plasma proteins, but the percentage decreases at
higher VPA levels. VPA has a small volume of distribution
(0.13–0.23 l/kg) [11,15,16].
VPA is extensively metabolized by the liver via glucuronic acid
conjugation, mitochondrial β- and cytosolic (endoplasmic
reticulum) ω-oxidation to produce multiple metabolites, some
of which may be biologically active (Fig. 2). However,
because of their low plasma and brain concentrations, it is
unlikely that they contribute significantly to the anticonvulsant
effects of VPA [10]. Nevertheless, some of them may be
involved in toxic effects of VPA, either in patients on chronic
dosing or after an acute overdose. For example, 2-propyl-2-
pentenoic acid (2-en-VPA), a byproduct of β-oxidation, and
2-propyl-4-pentenoic acid (4-en-VPA), a byproduct of
ω-oxidation, have been incriminated in the development of
cerebral oedema and in the hepatotoxicity of VPA, respectively [17-24]. 4-en-VPA and propionic acid metabolites
resulting from ω-oxidation could also promote hyperammonaemia [19,24]. Other metabolites, such as 3-cetoVPA
or 4-cetoVPA, may produce a false-positive urine ketone
determination [25].
Mitochondrial β-oxidation of VPA involves its transport within
the mitochondrial matrix, using the same pathway as do longchain fatty acids. This pathway consists of several steps and
is sometimes called the ‘carnitine shuttle’ (Fig. 3). First, in the
cytosol, VPA is activated and links with reduced acetyl
coenzyme A (CoA-SH) to form valproyl-CoA (by the ATPdependent medium-chain acyl-CoA synthetase, located on
the outer side of the mitochondrial membrane). Valproyl-CoA
then crosses the outer mitochondrial membrane. Under the
effect of the palmityl carnitine transferase (PCT)1,
valproylcarnitine is formed; this step is needed because the
inner mitochondrial membrane is not permeable to
acylcarnitines. Valproylcarnitine is then exchanged for free
carnitine by carnitine translocase. In the mitochondrial matrix,
PCT2 transformes valproylcarnitine into valproyl-CoA, which
is able to enter a slow β-oxidation process [26]. Carnitine
also helps to prevent valproyl-CoA accumulation [27].
The ω-oxidation is normally responsible for only a small
component of VPA metabolism (Fig. 2). However, during
long-term or high-dose VPA therapy, or after acute VPA
overdose, a greater degree of ω-oxidation occurs, potentially
increasing the risk for toxicity.
Less than 3% of VPA is excreted unchanged in the urine
[10,14,15], much of which is in the form of valproylcarnitine
[27,28].
Elimination of VPA follows first-order kinetics, with a half-life
ranging from 5 to 20 hours (mean 11 hours). However,
following overdose the half-life may be prolonged to as long
as 30 hours [11,16,17].
Carnitine
Carnitine (3-hydroxy-4-trimethylamino-butyric acid or β-hydroxygamma-N-trimethylamino-butyrate) thus appears essential to
ensure proper metabolism of VPA. This amino acid derivative

is an important nutrient; 75% comes from the diet, particularly
in red meat and dairy products. It is not a true vitamin
because it is also biosynthesized endogenously from dietary
amino acids (methionin, lysine), especially in the liver and in
the kidneys [29,30].
Most body carnitine is stored in skeletal muscles, but it is also
stored in other tissues with high energy demands
(myocardium, liver, suprarenal glands; 2.5–4 µmol/g tissue)
[31]. Plasma carnitine represents less than 0.6% of total
body stores. Indeed, the total plasma concentration (free
carnitine + acylcarnitine) is only 45–85 µmol/l.
The two main metabolic functions of carnitine are to facilitate
fatty acyl group transport into mitochondria and to maintain
the ratio of acyl-CoA to free CoA in the mitochondria [32].
Transport of long-chain fatty acids
Carnitine facilitates transport of long-chain fatty acids from the
cytosol compartment of the muscle fibre into the mitochondria,
where they undergo β-oxidation and produce acetyl-CoA,
which enters the Krebs cycle [27]. Indeed, esterification as
acylcarnitine is indispensable for transport of long-chain fatty
acids through the mitochondrial membrane [33]. This
transport process includes several steps (‘carnitine shuttle’),
which are described above for VPA [34,35].
Prevention of the intramitochondrial accumulation of
acyl-CoA
Carnitine facilitates prevention of intramitochondrial
accumulation of acyl-CoA by transforming acyl-CoA into
acylcarnitine. In this way, carnitine protects the cell from the
membrane-destabilizing effects of toxic acyl groups, as well
as their restraining effects on several enzymes that participate
in intermediary metabolism and energy production in the
mitochondria. Carnitine thus plays a central role in the
metabolism of fatty acids and energy by regulating the
mitochondrial ratio of free CoA to acyl-CoA.
Formulations of L-carnitine
L-Carnitine is available in some countries as an oral
preparation (1 g/10 ml solution, 330 mg tablets) or as an
injectable drug (intramuscular or intravenous, 1 g/5 ml
solution; e.g. Levocarnil® [Sigma-Tau, Ivry-sur-Seine, France]
and Carnitor® [Sigma-Tau, Gaithersburg, MD, USA]). It has
been administered in senile dementia, metabolic nerve
diseases, HIV infection, tuberculosis, myopathies,
cardiomyopathies, renal failure and anaemia, and has been
included in baby foods and milk [31]. Carnitine
supplementation has also been advocated in chronic VPA
treatment, but data are limited (see below).
Carnitine deficiency
A typical, well balanced omnivorous diet contains significant
amounts of carnitine (20–200 mg/day for a 70 kg person) as
well as the essential amino acids and micronutrients needed
for carnitine biosynthesis. Even in strict vegetarian diets (as
little as 1 mg/day exogenous carnitine for a 70 kg person),
endogenous synthesis combined with the high tubular
reabsorption rate is enough to prevent deficiency in generally
healthy people. Thus, carnitine deficiency is an unusual
problem in the healthy, well nourished adult population [36].
Primary carnitine deficiency is rare and is caused by a genetic
defect in membrane carnitine transporter in muscle and/or
other organs. Both the myopathic and systemic forms are
inherited autosomal and recessive.
Secondary carnitine deficiency is associated with several
inborn errors of metabolism and acquired medical conditions
[29,36]. Preterm neonates develop carnitine deficiency
because of impaired proximal renal tubule carnitine
reabsorption and immature carnitine biosynthesis. The final
step in carnitine synthesis that occurs in liver and kidney
depends on the enzyme γ-butyrobetaine hydroxylase, which
may be deficient in children. An increasing number of
problems are reported in relation to carnitine metabolism in
preterm infants not receiving an exogenous source of
carnitine. Children with various forms of organic acidaemia
have carnitine requirements that exceed their dietary intake
and biosynthetic capability, in order to permit excretion of
accumulating organic acids.
In cirrhosis and chronic renal failure, endogenous carnitine
biosynthesis is impaired. Patients with renal disease also
appear to lose carnitine via haemodialysis treatment – a loss
that cannot be repleted simply by endogenous biosynthesis
and dietary intake. Other chronic conditions such as
malabsorption, Fanconi syndrome, diabetes mellitus, heart
failure and Alzheimer’s disease have also been associated
with carnitine deficiency. Carnitine deficiency is also
observed in critical conditions that involve increased

catabolism, such as trauma, sepsis and organ failure, which
result in increased need for exogenous carnitine.
Finally, several drugs, especially VPA but also anti-HIV
nucleoside analogues, pivalic acid-containing antibiotics and
some chemotherapy agents (e.g. ifosfamide, cisplatin and
doxorubicin), are associated with decreased carnitine levels
and occasionally with true carnitine deficiency [36,37].
With respect to VPA, this agent depletes carnitine stores,
especially during long-term or high-dose therapy, through
various synergistic mechanisms [22,38-41]. First, as a
branched chain fatty acid, VPA combines with carnitine to
form valproylcarnitine, which is excreted in urine [42].
However, because this excretion accounts for less than 1% of
total acylcarnitine elimination in urine [43], it is unlikely that
excretion of VPA alone is sufficient to produce carnitine
deficiency in well nourished patients [44]. Second, a reduction
in tubular reabsorption of both free carnitine and acylcarnitine
has been reported during VPA treatment [45,46], Third, VPA
reduces endogenous synthesis of carnitine by blockade of the
enzyme butyrobetaine hydroxylase. Fourth, valproylcarnitine
inhibits the membrane carnitine transporter, thereby
decreasing the transport of extracellular carnitine into the cell
and the mitochondria. VPA also induces reversible inhibition of
plasmalemmal carnitine uptake in vitro in cultured human skin
fibroblasts [47]. Fifth, VPA metabolites combine with
mitochondrial CoA-SH. The pool of free CoA-SH decreases,
so that free mitochondrial carnitine stores cannot be restored
from acylcarnitine (including valproylcanitine) under the action
of CPT2. Finally, the mitochondrial depletion of CoA-SH
impairs β-oxidation of fatty acids (and VPA) and ATP
production. ATP depletion further impairs the function of the
ATP-dependent membrane carnitine transporter.
Although systematic assessment of carnitine status has been
recommended in VPA-treated patients [27,29], hypocarnitinaemia has not been confirmed in all studies. For example, in a
recent cross-sectional surveillance study conducted in 43
paediatric patients taking VPA [48], only two were found to
have carnitine levels below the normal limit, suggesting that
routine carnitine level checking is not justified. Indeed, VPAtreated patients may be carnitine depleted despite having
normal carnitine serum levels [49].
Risks factors for carnitine depletion include age under
24 months, the presence of concomitant neurologic or metabolic disorders, and receipt of multiple AEDs. Measurement
of carnitine levels is probably warranted in those patients who
are at risk for carnitine deficiency in order to identify those
who need carnitine supplementation.
Carnitine depletion has several adverse effects. First, it can
impair the transport of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix, with subsequent decrease in β-oxidation,
acetyl-CoA and ATP production. In turn, the impairment in
β-oxidation can shift the metabolism of VPA toward
predominantly peroxisomal ω-oxidation, resulting in excessive
production and accumulation of ω-oxidation products,
including 4-en-VPA – a metabolite that is incriminated in
VPA-induced hepatotoxicity. Carnitine depletion can also
result in intracellular accumulation of toxic acyl-CoA, resulting
in impairment in several enzymatic processes (α-ketoacid
oxidation and gluconeogenesis, among others). Finally,
carnitine depletion can impair the urea cycle, resulting in
accumulation of ammonia (Fig. 4) [4,38]. This effect may be
due either to inhibition of carbamyl phosphate synthase
(CPS) I by ω-oxidation metabolites (CPS I is the first
mitochondrial enzymatic step of the urea cycle) or to
decreased synthesis of N-acetyl glutamic acid (NAGA) from
acetyl-CoA and glutamate by NAGA synthetase (NAGA is an
important cofactor of CPS I).
Carnitine supplementation in valproic acid
induced toxicity
Because VPA-induced hyperammonaemia and VHT could be
mediated at least in part by carnitine deficiency, it has been
hypothesized that L-carnitine supplementation may prevent,
correct, or attenuate these adverse effects. Although strong
recommendations were made by the Paediatric Neurology
Advisory Committee in 1996 and reproduced in many
textbooks, the role of carnitine remains ill defined. Three
conditions – VHT, VHE and acute VPA overdose – receive
separate focus below.
Valproate-induced hepatotoxicity
In up to 44% of patients chronic dosing with VPA may be
associated with elevation in transaminases [23] during the

first months of therapy. Usually, it resolves completely when
the drug is discontinued. Severe VHT in association with
hepatic failure is rare, but it may develop as an idiosyncratic
reaction that is often fatal. It usually occurs during the first
6 months of VPA therapy and is commonly but not always
preceded by minor elevations in transaminases. Reports of
severe VHT following acute VPA overdose are rare [50].
The most common clinical presentation consists of lethargy,
jaundice, nausea, vomiting, haemorrhage, worsening seizures
and anorexia [23]. Histological changes are similar to those
observed in the Reye’s syndrome, with early production of
microvesicular steatosis followed by development of centrilobular necrosis [23].
Risks factors include age under 24 months (especially those
with organic brain disease), developmental delay, coincident
congenital metabolic disorders, previous liver dysfunction, or
severe epilepsy treated with polytherapy or ketogenic diets
[23,51,52]. Although the overall incidence is estimated at
1/5000 to 1/50,000, the occurrence of fatal hepatotoxicity
could be as high as 1/800 to 1/500 in these high-risk
groups [11].
The mechanisms of both subacute and idiosyncratic VHT
remain incompletely understood, but it has been believed
since the early 1980s – based on limited experimental and
clinical evidence [53-56] – that hypocarnitinaemia,
subsequent imbalance between β-oxidation and ω-oxidation,
and accumulation of 4-en-VPA are involved. Additionally,
carnitine deficit may result in disruption of mitochondrial
functions due to depletion in CoA-SH [23,27,51].
Reduced serum free carnitine as well as reduced levels of 3-
keto-VPA, the main metabolite of β-oxidation of VPA, was first
reported in 1982 by Bohles and coworkers [53] in a 3-yearold girl who developed acute liver disease with typical
features of Reye’s syndrome after treatment with VPA for
6 months. Reduced free carnitine and increased serum and
urine acylcarnitine levels were also demonstrated in patients
with VPA-induced Reye-like syndrome [45]. In a patient with
fatal VHT, Krahenbuhl and coworkers [57] demonstrated a
reduction in free and total carnitine in plasma and liver.
Laub and coworkers [58] prospectively examined the
influence of VPA on carnitinaemia, as well as the possible
aetiological role of carnitine in fatal VHT. Total carnitine, free
carnitine and acylcarnitine were measured in the serum of 21
paediatric patients receiving VPA therapy, 21 healthy
matched control individuals, and 21 patients receiving various
AEDs other than VPA. The free carnitine level was the lowest
(P < 0.05) and the short-chain acylcarnitine/free carnitine
ratio was the highest (P < 0.01) in the VPA group. Moreover,
patients receiving polytherapy including VPA had lower total
carnitine values than did patients receiving VPA monotherapy
(P < 0.05). However, the authors suggested that carnitine
deficiency cannot be the only reason for fatal VHT, because a
3.5-year-old girl developed hepatic failure under VPA therapy
despite normal serum carnitine values, and died despite oral
L-carnitine supplementation.
Other mechanisms such as VPA-induced lipid peroxidation and
glutathione depletion could also contribute to hepatotoxicity
[59]. Indeed, 4-en-VPA is transformed through β-oxidation to
reactive intermediates such as 2-propyl-2, 4-pentadienoic acid
(2, 4-dien-VPA) that are capable of depleting mitochondrial
GSH, as suggested by rat studies [60]. Unsaturated VPA
metabolites (4-en-VPA and 2, 4-dien-VPA) are potent inducers
of microvesicular steatosis in rats, whereas VPA itself failed to
induce discernible liver lesions at near lethal doses [60].
Studies in rats [61] also suggested that both VPA and its
unsaturated metabolites inhibit β-oxidation through different
mechanisms, such as sequestration of CoA-SH and direct
inhibition of specific enzymes in the β-oxidation sequence by
CoA esters, particularly 4-en-VPA-CoA.
Role of carnitine
The common mild elevation in aminotransferases is usually
reversible when VPA therapy is discontinued or the dose
reduced. Even in severe VHT, the prognosis seems to be
improved if VPA therapy is promptly discontinued [62]. Some
experimental and clinical evidence also suggests that the
early administration of intravenous L-carnitine could further
improve survival in severe VHT. Intravenous rather than oral
supplementation is recommended because it is likely to
ensure higher levels of carnitine in the blood (L-carnitine has
poor gastrointestinal bioavailability, which is further
compromised by digestive dysfunction).
In an experimental study conducted in rats treated with
therapeutic and toxic doses of VPA, Shakoor [63] found that
carnitine supplementation was able to prevent fatty infiltration
and liver necrosis induced by VPA. No animal study has
evaluated the effect of L-carnitine when hepatotoxicity has
already developed. There is also a lack of human controlled
studies. Among cases of severe hepatotoxicity occurring
during VPA therapy, survival has been reported mainly in
those patients treated with carnitine [64-67], and this
approach is likely to be biased. However, failures of carnitine
therapy have occasionally been reported [58].
In a series of 92 patients (most of whom had features of
chronic illness or were malnourished children) with severe,
symptomatic VHT, Bohan and coworkers [68] observed that
48% of the 42 patients treated with L-carnitine survived,
whereas only 10% of the 50 (historical) patients treated
solely with aggressive supportive care survived (P < 0.001).
Moreover, the 10 patients who were diagnosed within 5 days
and treated with intravenous L-carnitine survived. Although
these observations are interesting, the comparison with
historical control individuals is a serious limitation in the
interpretation of these results.

Valproate-induced hyperammonaemic encephalopathy
In chronic VPA dosing hyperammonaemia occurs in nearly
50% of patients, but this remains asymptomatic in almost
50% of cases [39]. VHE is a rare phenomenon in adults,
especially when VPA is used as monotherapy. VHE is
typically characterized by acute onset of impaired consciousness, focal neurologic symptoms and increased seizure
frequency [69]. It may occur after both ‘acute on chronic’
overdosage and regular chronic use of VPA [16-
19,24,25,38,70]. Very high ammonia levels have been
reported, even with normal liver function tests [71].
Various mechanisms have been implicated in the development of VPA-induced hyperammonaemia. Matsuda and
coworkers [45] demonstrated a considerable reduction in
serum free carnitine concentration in five patients with
hyperammonaemia associated with VPA therapy (of whom
three had a Reye-like syndrome). Various authors have shown
that serum ammonia concentrations directly correlate with the
dose or serum concentrations of VPA, and inversely with
serum concentrations of carnitine [22,38,39]. Lokrantz and
coworkers [72] recently reported the case of an old woman
taking VPA monotherapy for her partial epilepsy in whom a
typical hyperammonaemic encephalopathy was precipitated
by treatment for a urinary tract infection with pivmecillinam –
an antibiotic known to decrease the serum concentration of
carnitine. Also, metabolites of VPA ω-oxidation (including
propionic derivatives and 4-en-VPA) inhibit the mitochondrial
CPS I, which is the first enzyme necessary for ammonia
elimination via the urea cycle in the liver [19,24]. This effect
appears related to the dose of VPA [73]. As acetyl-CoA
stores are depleted, the synthesis of NAGA – an important
cofactor of CPS I – from acetyl-CoA and glutamate by NAGA
synthetase is decreased.
VHE is more frequently observed in patients with congenital
defects of the urea enzymatic cycle or with carnitine
deficiency [69]. It may also be precipitated by a protein-rich
diet [74,75] or catabolism induced by fasting [76,77].
An increase in the renal production of ammonia could be
another factor that contributes to the development of hyperammonaemia in VPA-treated patients. Indeed, VPA promotes
the transport of glutamine through the mitochondrial
membrane, thereby enhancing glutaminase activity. Ammonia
is released as a result of the transformation of glutamine into
glutamate [78,79]. Both animal [76] and human [77] studies
suggest that VPA-induced hyperammonaemia may be
enhanced via renal rather than hepatic mechanisms.
The pathogenesis of hyperammonaemic encephalopathy is
still incompletely understood, and a detailed discussion of the
topic is beyond the scope of this review. Ammonia readily
crosses the blood–brain barrier and is thought to inhibit
glutamate uptake, thereby increasing extracellular glutamate
concentrations in the brain and resulting in activation of
NMDA receptors. NMDA receptor activation is associated
with a decrease in phosphorylation by protein kinase C,
activation of Na+–K+ ATPase and ATP depletion. Activation of
the NMDA receptors is a major factor in the pathogenesis of
hyperammonaemic encephalopathy and is probably the cause
of seizures. However, other factors may be involved, including
accumulation of lactate, pyruvate, glutamine and free glucose,
and depletion of glycogen, ketone bodies and glutamate.
With respect to VHE, Verrotti and coworkers [69] demonstrated an increase in glutamine production in astrocytes
whereas glutamine release was inhibited. Glutamine
accumulation increases intracellular osmolarity, promoting an
influx of water with resultant astrocytic swelling, cerebral
oedema and increased intracranial pressure [68]. The VPA βoxidation metabolite 2-en-VPA is another agent that can
promote cerebral oedema when it accumulates in brain and
plasma. Although β-oxidation is impaired in the setting of VPA
toxicity, this metabolite has a prolonged elimination half-life
and could be responsible for the prolonged coma that is
sometimes observed despite the normalization in plasma VPA
concentrations [17,18].
Conversely, there is no evidence for accumulation of valproylCoA in brain tissue, suggesting that the effects of VPA in the
CNS are independent of the formation of this metabolite [80].
Development of cerebral oedema is not clearly correlated
with the dose of VPA ingested [20].
Role of carnitine
Carnitine supplementation (50 mg/kg per day) for 4 weeks
was shown to correct both carnitine deficiency and hyperammonaemia in 14 VPA-treated patients [38]. Administration
of exogenous carnitine is thought to decrease ammonia levels
by binding to VPA, thereby enhancing the β-oxidation
process and production of acetyl-CoA, and relieving the
inhibition of urea synthesis.
Bohles and coworkers [81] investigated the effects of
carnitine supplementation in 69 children and young adults
treated with VPA monotherapy. Their mean plasma ammonia
concentration was within the normal range, but 24 patients
(35.3%) with ammonia concentrations above 80 µg/dl were
considered hyperammonaemic and 15 of these 24 (22.1%)
had ammonia concentrations above 100 µg/dl. Total plasma
carnitine concentrations were determined in 48 out of 69
patients and were found to be rather low, as was the
percentage of free carnitine. Fourteen hyperammonaemic and
one normoammonaemic patients were supplemented with
L-carnitine (500 mg/m2, twice daily). Prolonged L-carnitine
supplementation was associated with normalization in plasma
ammonia concentrations and marked increase in carnitine
concentration in all 15 patients. The plasma ammonia
concentrations were significantly correlated with the
percentage of free plasma carnitine in plasma (r = –0.67,
P < 0.0001). These findings indicate that carnitine suppleCritical Care October 2005 Vol 9 No 5 Lheureux et al.

mentation allows normalization of elevated plasma ammonia
concentrations. However, a correlation between ammonia
levels and clinical condition is not always observed.
Borbath and coworkers [82] reported the case of a 51-yearold woman who received 10 mg/kg VPA daily to prevent
seizures after a neurosurgical procedure, and who developed
VHE (ammonia concentration 234 µmol/l) without any sign of
hepatic dysfunction. VPA was stopped and L-carnitine
supplementation (100 mg/kg) was administered intravenously.
Ammonia levels rapidly decreased within 10 hours (to
35 µmol/l), the neurological condition improved and triphasic
waves on the electroencephalogram disappeared. However,
the initial plasma carnitine level was normal in this patient.
Conversely, Hantson and coworkers [83] recently reported
the case of a 47-year-old epileptic man in whom parenteral
VPA therapy was associated with a severe hyperammonaemic encephalopathy (peak ammonia concentration
411 µmol/l) without any biological signs of hepatotoxicity.
VPA treatment was discontinued and L-carnitine supplementation (100 mg/kg per day) was initiated. Although subsequent normalization in the blood arterial ammonia level was
observed within 4 days, the patient remained comatose for
3 weeks. The clinical course was correlated with magnetic
resonance imaging and multimodal evoked potential findings,
but not with ammonia levels.
Acute valproic acid overdose
Acute VPA intoxication is an increasing problem and this
topic was recently reviewed [4]. The clinical and biological
manifestations that may be encountered reflect both
exaggerated therapeutic effect and impairment in metabolic
pathways.
CNS depression is the most common manifestation of
toxicity, ranging in severity from mild drowsiness to profound
coma and fatal cerebral oedema [20,50]. However, the
majority of patients only experience mild to moderate lethargy
and recover uneventfully with only supportive care [4,84,85].
Although there is no close relationship between plasma VPA
concentrations and the severity of CNS toxicity [11,86],
patients who ingest more than 200 mg/kg VPA and/or have
plasma concentrations greater than 180 µg/ml usually
develop severe CNS depression. In such severe cases,
cerebral oedema becomes clinically apparent 12 hours to
4 days after the overdose [18,20,50,87], although CNS
depression may be delayed if a slow-release preparation has
been ingested [12,50].
Other clinical findings include respiratory depression, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhoea, hypothermia or fever, hypotension, tachycardia, miosis, agitation, hallucinations, tremors, myoclonus
and seizures. In contrast to poisoning with phenytoin or
carbamazepine, nystagmus, dysarthria and ataxia are rarely
noted following VPA overdose. Other recognized but rare
complications of overdose include heart block, pancreatitis,
acute renal failure, alopecia, leucopenia, thrombocytopenia,
anaemia, optic nerve atrophy and acute respiratory distress
syndrome [18,50]. Acute VPA poisoning is rarely associated
with a minor and reversible elevation in transaminases [17,18].
Hyperammonaemia, anion gap metabolic acidosis, hyperosmolality, hypernatraemia and hypocalcaemia [18,20,50] may
also develop.
Management of acute VPA intoxication is largely supportive.
Patients who present early may benefit from gastrointestinal
decontamination with a single dose of activated charcoal.
Other interventions may involve blood pressure support with
intravenous fluids and vasopressors, and correction of
electrolyte abnormalities or acid–base disorders (commonly
an anion gap metabolic acidosis). Mechanical ventilation may
be necessary in patients who require airway protection or
who develop cerebral oedema or respiratory depression.
In patients with renal dysfunction, refractory hypotension,
severe metabolic abnormalities, active seizure, or persistent
coma, extracorporeal removal by haemodialysis or
haemofiltration may be considered, although there are no
controlled trials that demonstrate an improvement in outcome
with these measures [88-90]. Similarly, there is no evidence
that multiple doses of activated charcoal do increase the
elimination of VPA or toxic metabolites.
Role of carnitine
Although data in this setting are sparse, consisting of
anecdotal case reports, it has been suggested that carnitine
supplementation could hasten resolution of coma, prevent
development of hepatic dysfunction and reverse mitochondrial
metabolic abnormalities in patients with acute VPA intoxication
[22,70]. For example, a healthy, nonepileptic, 16-month-old
child ingested a massive overdose (approximately 4 g) of VPA
[22]. Upon admission to the hospital he was in a deep coma
and had generalized hypotonicity and no response to pain. His
serum and urinary concentrations of VPA were 1316.2 and
3289.5 µg/ml, respectively. Urinary concentrations of the βoxidation metabolites of VPA were low, whereas
concentrations of ω-oxidation metabolites were high.
Moreover, the hepatotoxic compound 4-en-VPA was detected
in urine. Gastric lavage and general supportive measures were
undertaken, including intravenous infusion of saline to increase
urine output, and oral L-carnitine was administered for 4 days
to correct hypocarnitinaemia. Subsequently, the β-oxidation
metabolites increased, the ω-oxidation metabolites decreased
and 4-en-valproate was no longer detected in urine. However,
the child only regained consciousness on day 4, when his
serum VPA concentration reached therapeutic levels. The
patient completely recovered and was discharged from
hospital on day 8 without any sequelae.
In another child who accidentally ingested 400 mg/kg VPA,
decreased β-oxidation and markedly increased ω-oxidation
Available online http://ccforum.com/content/9/5/431

438
were also observed, and the concentration of 4-en-VPA was
markedly increased, although there was neither hyperammonaemia nor signs of liver dysfunction [70]. After L-carnitine
supplementation for 3 days, VPA metabolism returned to
normal. Once again the child remained comatose until day 3.
The level of valproylcarnitine was not increased and was not
affected by L-carnitine supplements.
Minville and coworkers [91] recently reported a case of
severe VPA poisoning in a 36-year-old man. Haemodialysis
was initiated to decrease the high serum VPA concentration
and L-carnitine therapy (50 mg/kg per day for 4 days) was
empirically started. Despite this treatment, cerebral oedema
appeared on the third day. With usual neuroprotective
measures, the patient improved after 4 days and finally
recovered without sequelae.
Because hepatotoxicity is rare after acute overdose, the lack
of transaminase elevation following prophylactic carnitine
administration does not demonstrate its hepatoprotective
properties. As far as CNS depression is concerned, the
clinical observations do not suggest that carnitine is able to
hasten the recovery of consciousness. Nevertheless, in 1996
the Paediatric Neurology Advisory Committee recommended
carnitine supplementation for children with VPA overdoses.
Subsequent, more restrictive recommendations limit carnitine
supplements to those children with overdoses above
400 mg/kg.
Carnitine supplements in the prevention of
valproic acid toxicity
Raskind and El-Chaar [41] extensively reviewed the pathophysiology and significance of VPA-induced carnitine
deficiency and evaluated the literature pertaining to carnitine
supplementation during VPA therapy in children. Despite the
lack of prospective, randomized clinical trials, a few studies
have shown carnitine supplementation in patients receiving
VPA to result in subjective and objective improvements and
to prevent VHT, in parallel with increases in carnitine serum
levels. The Pediatric Neurology Advisory Committee in 1996
and some textbooks and manuals strongly recommended
carnitine supplementation (50–100 mg/kg per day) during
VPA therapy for children at risk for developing a carnitine
deficiency, in VPA overdose and in VHT [33,92,93]. Carnitine
supplementation has been classified ‘grade C’ (may be
useful) in patients treated with VPA for seizure disorders [94].
There is no clear evidence that appreciable toxic effects are
associated with use of carnitine. Moreover, when it is used to
prevent carnitine deficiency, carnitine did not seem to alter
the anticonvulsant properties of VPA in an experimental
model in mice [95].
Until further data become available, L-carnitine supplementation may be recommended in those children on VPA
therapy at greatest risk for hepatotoxicity (<2 years of age,
more than one anticonvulsant, poor nutritional status,
ketogenic diet). In older children or adults it may be
considered if there are clinical symptoms suggestive of
carnitine deficiency (hypotonia, lethargy), a significant
decrease in the serum free carnitine levels, an impairment in
hepatic function tests, or hyperammonaemia, even in the
absence of VHE.
Conclusion
The potential value of oral L-carnitine in reversing carnitine
deficiency and preventing adverse effects due to VPAinduced dysfunction of β-oxidation is suggested by several
studies and isolated observations. Carnitine supplementation
is now recommended in acute overdose, VHE and VHT by
some scientific committees and textbooks, especially in highrisk paediatric patients.
Carnitine supplementation does not appear to be harmful and
could be beneficial in patients with VHT or hyperammonaemia, regardless of whether the exposure was acute,
chronic, or both. Conversely, although carnitine appears to
normalize the metabolic pathways of VPA in acute overdose,
the few clinical data that are available do not support the use
of carnitine in patients with VPA-induced CNS depression.
Finally, prophylactic supplementation with L-carnitine seems
reasonable in high risk patients.
However, better delineation of the therapeutic and prophylactic roles of L-carnitine in these conditions will require
further investigations in controlled, randomized and probably
multicentre trials to evaluate the clinical value and the
appropriate dosage of L-carnitine in each of these conditions.
