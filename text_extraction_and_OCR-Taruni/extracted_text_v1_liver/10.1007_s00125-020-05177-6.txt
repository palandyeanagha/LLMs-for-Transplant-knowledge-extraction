Abstract
Regular exercise is a formidable regulator of insulin sensitivity and overall systemic metabolism through both acute events driven
by each exercise bout and through chronic adaptations. As a result, regular exercise significantly reduces the risks for chronic
metabolic disease states, including type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Many of the metabolic health benefits of
exercise depend on skeletal muscle adaptations; however, there is plenty of evidence that exercise exerts many of its metabolic
benefit through the liver, adipose tissue, vasculature and pancreas. This review will highlight how exercise reduces metabolic
disease risk by activating metabolic changes in non-skeletal-muscle tissues. We provide an overview of exercise-induced
adaptations within each tissue and discuss emerging work on the exercise-induced integration of inter-tissue communication
by a variety of signalling molecules, hormones and cytokines collectively named ‘exerkines’. Overall, the evidence clearly
indicates that exercise is a robust modulator of metabolism and a powerful protective agent against metabolic disease, and this
is likely to be because it robustly improves metabolic function in multiple organs.

Introduction
Regular exercise can reduce the risks for developing obesity [1]
and the metabolic complications and disease associated with
obesity, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)
[2] and type 2 diabetes [3]. Exercise has these powerful effects
on metabolism, not only because of its well-known effects on
skeletal muscle metabolism, but also as a result of the metabolic
adaptations it confers in multiple other tissues. Herein we
provide an overview of the evidence that exercise is a powerful
tool for the prevention of metabolic disease and that it exerts its
protective effects by improving the metabolic phenotype of nonskeletal-muscle tissues, including the liver, vasculature, adipose
tissue and pancreas. We also highlight that these multi-tissue
adaptations occur not only through exercise activating intrinsic
signalling events in each tissue but also through the unique,
exercise-induced integration of inter-tissue communication by
a variety of signalling molecules, hormones, cytokines, changes

in substrate flux and blood flow. Rather than drilling down on
specific mechanisms of action, this perspective provides a broad
overview. We also seek to leverage this evidence to suggest that
a certain minimum volume of exercise or physical activity is
required for normal metabolic function.
Overview of metabolic disease pathology
Insulin resistance, the inability of insulin to effectively stimulate glucose uptake into metabolic tissues (skeletal muscle,
adipose and liver), turn off hepatic glucose production and
reduce adipose lipolysis, is a primary event underlying type
2 diabetes. Insulin resistance not only contributes to
hyperglycaemia in type 2 diabetes but also putatively plays a
role in the inappropriate excess storage of fat (ectopic) in the
liver (hepatic steatosis) [4]. In turn, higher levels of ectopic
storage of lipids in muscle and the liver is also associated with
insulin resistance. Causality between hepatic steatosis, intramuscular lipid storage and insulin resistance remains controversial, but evidence clearly shows that insulin resistance is
often associated with greater ectopic fat storage [5]. For
reasons not understood, the liver becomes selectively insulin
resistant in controlling glucose output but remains highly
sensitive to the lipogenic effects of insulin [6]. Finally, insulin
resistance also plays a fundamental role in reduced metabolic
flexibility, which is defined as the capacity to switch between
metabolic substrates depending on which is most readily
available [7].
Inflammation, oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum
stress have also been linked to metabolic dysfunction through
both lipid- and non-lipid-mediated pathways (for an extensive
review, see [8]). In general, these pathways are believed to
impair molecular insulin signalling pathways in metabolic
tissues, resulting in tissue-specific and systemic metabolic
alterations that, when combined with chronic positive energy
balance, can lead to NAFLD and type 2 diabetes. A prevailing
view is that obesity precedes and causes insulin resistance, and
this is followed by hyper insulin secretion by the pancreatic
beta cells to compensate for impaired insulin signalling [9].
However, emerging evidence indicates that hyperinsulinaemia
is likely to contribute to metabolic dysfunction and the development of obesity in a feed-forward manner [10]. This effect is
witnessed in humans who transition from highly active to very
inactive lifestyles for 1–2 weeks, and display elevated insulin
responses paired with rapid gains in adiposity [11, 12].
Exercise and prevention of metabolic disease
Only recently has the biomedical scientific community fully
recognised the powerful effects of exercise in the prevention
and treatment of metabolic disease, even proving to be more
beneficial than some low-performing pharmacological agents.
Type 2 diabetes and NAFLD are two primary metabolic
disease states with prevalence rates that are increasing at
epidemic rates but can be prevented with regular exercise.
Prevention of type 2 diabetes A daily threshold for a relatively small volume of physical activity (>3500 steps/day or
>20 min/day) [13, 14] has been shown to be protective in
reducing the transition of those with impaired glucose tolerance to frank type 2 diabetes. Overall, pooled results show that
150 min/week of moderate to vigorous physical activity will
reduce the risk for type 2 diabetes by 30% [15]. More information on this effect has been reviewed previously [3].
Individuals who maintain a long-term habit of moderate
volume but vigorous running have a significantly reduced risk
for obesity and type 2 diabetes [16] and, in a more recent
report, indices of volume, distance and intensity in leisure
runners were all linearly associated with reduced risk for type
2 diabetes [17]. Furthermore, studies have repeatedly shown
that a threshold of measured cardiorespiratory fitness (i.e.
aerobic capacity or maximum oxygen consumption [V˙ O2max
]) of ~9–10 metabolic equivalents (METs) also lowers risk for
transitioning to a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes [18].
Prevention of NAFLD Excessive intrahepatic fat storage
(hepatic steatosis), is the entryway to NAFLD, an umbrella
condition that also encompasses steatohepatitis, fibrosis and
cirrhosis. The development of hepatic steatosis also increases
the risk for type 2 diabetes. Despite being an important target
for the pharmacological industry, NAFLD currently has no
treatment other than lifestyle interventions, including weight
loss and exercise. Overall, there are far less data available on
how exercise impacts NAFLD because it is a newer problem
and because NAFLD can only be evaluated with invasive liver
biopsies or with technologically advanced imaging methodologies. However, higher volumes of physical activity have
been shown to reduce intrahepatic lipid levels [19].
Cardiorespiratory fitness, a measurable marker of regular
exercise, has been shown to independently reduce the risk of
NAFLD [20, 21], an effect that is independent of, or only
moderately impacted by, obesity status [19].
Exercise also induces a large number of other positive
effects, including improved weight management, improved
bone density, reduced frequency and severity of cardiovascular disease and hypertension and of depression and anxiety,
reduced risk for specific forms of cancer, reduced dementia,
and improved strength, mobility and healthspan. In fact,
increased risk for 35 chronic disease conditions have been
independently linked to physical inactivity [22], leading us
to speculate that daily physical activity and exercise may be
required for normal health and function. Thus, our drive for
technological advances and ease of daily living is working in
opposition to our biology [22]. The excessive consumption of
Diabetologia (2020) 63:1464–1474 1465

hyperenergetic, nutrient-poor diets further synergises with
inactivity to drive epidemic rates of metabolic disease.
There is no doubt that skeletal muscle adaptations to exercise are important; however, physical exercise is not possible
without the orchestrated cooperation of several tissues to
support muscular work and maintain metabolic homoeostasis.
Exercise training therefore results in adaptations to other
tissues involved in these processes, including adipose tissue,
liver, endothelium and pancreas.
Muscle-centric vs integrative view
of the impact of exercise on metabolic health
In the following sections, we discuss the acute (Fig. 1) and
chronic (Fig. 2) effects of exercise on each of the peripheral
organs involved in the regulation of whole-body insulin
sensitivity and metabolic health, and the associated systemic
health effects. Unless otherwise specified, only data from
human studies are presented. A growing body of work
implicates hundreds or even thousands of proteins secreted
by the main peripheral tissues (i.e. myokines by skeletal
muscle [23], hepatokines by the liver [24] and adipokines
by adipose tissue [25]) involved in the regulation of energy
homeostasis and whole-body insulin sensitivity. However,
only a few have been characterised and had their biological
function demonstrated. During exercise, some of these
proteins, collectively named ‘exerkines’, are secreted, and
create a complex inter-organ network that contributes to
the systemic metabolic health effects of exercise [26]. We
also posit that ‘substrate flux’ between organs may work in
concert with exerkines or independently to induce adaptations. Here we mention the molecular factors that have been
recently identified and thought to potentially coordinate the
inter-organ crosstalk in response to exercise (Fig. 3).
Undoubtedly, numerous other signalling molecules will be
identified in the years ahead, and future research will need to
delineate the respective contribution of such molecules. In
addition, because this area is still relatively new, controversies exist, and whether the findings from animals can be
translated to humans is questionable.
Skeletal muscle adaptations Skeletal muscle is the largest
metabolic tissue in the human body and a critical site for
glucose disposal both at rest and during exercise [27].
During exercise, skeletal muscle uses both muscle glycogen
stores and circulating plasma glucose as sources of fuel.
Muscle contractions, even at low intensity and low volume
[28], activate both oxidative and non-oxidative glucose
disposal and glucose uptake via insulin-dependent and

-independent mechanisms [29], optimising insulin action and
both glucose oxidation and storage. Continuation of regular
exercise further augments skeletal muscle oxidative capacity,
mitochondrial biogenesis [30] and mitochondrial quality
control mechanisms (mitophagy, fission, fusion), although
this has been less well examined [31, 32]. Endurance training
promotes the trafficking of dietary fatty acids away from
storage and towards oxidation via an increased capacity for
myocyte fatty acid transport paired with increased fatty acid
oxidation in mitochondria in both normal weight and overweight adults [33]. In addition, exercise training increases
intramuscular triacylglycerol turnover and reduces lipid intermediate (diacylglycerols and ceramides) content [34].

Fig. 2 Chronic effects of exercise on key peripheral organs involved in
the regulation of energy homeostasis and associated whole-body metabolic effects and systemic health effects. Exercise training improves
V˙ O2max, decreases resting heart rate and blood pressure, and increases
total muscle mass. Microvascular network is expanded and microvascular
dilatory response is improved. Beta cell function is improved along with a
greater blood glucose uptake by muscle, adipose tissue and liver, and
peripheral tissue insulin sensitivity is ameliorated. Capacity for
mobilisation of NEFA from adipose tissue is improved along with a
greater capacity of liver for glucose production and decrease in de novo
lipogenesis. Capacity for oxidising fat in liver and muscle in association
with greater mitochondrial oxidative capacity and biogenesis is also
increased. This results in reduced visceral adipose tissue depots and
ectopic fat storage. Altogether these structural, functional and metabolic
adaptations improve aerobic capacity, whole-body insulin sensitivity,
glucose control, oxidative capacity and reduce triglycerolaemia and
chronic inflammation. These changes reduce the risk of developing insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, NAFL and CV diseases, the metabolic
syndrome, obesity and, ultimately, early mortality. CV, cardiovascular;

exercise would lead to hypoglycaemia if it was not paired with
a rapid upregulation of hepatic glucose output. Thus, exercise
also drives critical acute and chronic adaptations to hepatic
metabolism.
As previously reviewed [26, 35], the skeletal muscle secretory response, including a constellation of myokines, extracellular vesicles and their cargo, and metabolites, has recently
been implicated in exercise-mediated multisystemic adaptations that improve metabolic health. They can act in a
paracrine/autocrine or endocrine manner. Although numerous
molecular analytes have been detected, the functions of only a
few are well established. For example, levels of brain-derived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF), proteins belonging to the natriuretic peptide family (e.g. B-type natriuretic peptide [BNP]),
musclin, IL-15, IL-6, apelin, secreted protein acidic and rich in
cysteine (SPARC), fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF-21),
decorin, myonectin and irisin have been shown to increase
in the circulation in response to exercise and these molecules
are likely to play a role in the control of muscle mass and
skeletal muscle metabolism in an autocrine fashion, as
reviewed elsewhere [36, 37]. The effect of some of these
molecular factors have been studied in rodents or in in vitro

Fig. 3 Inter-organ crosstalk and substrate fluxes during exercise. Based
on recent data in animals and humans, the following cascade of events is
hypothesised to occur during exercise. ATP turnover, glycogen depletion
and/or muscle contraction trigger the secretion of myokines that will act
in a paracrine way and act on skeletal muscle mass and metabolism
including IL-6 and IL-15, apelin, musclin and BDNF or in an endocrine
fashion on metabolism and function of liver (myonectin, IL-6), pancreas
(IL-6), microvasculature (VEGF-B, NO) and adipose tissue (IL-6,
FGF21, irisin, GDF15) or other tissues (SPARC and decorin).
Pancreatic secretion of glucagon is increased and insulin is decreased,
catecholamines are secreted by the sympathetic nervous system and
ANP by the heart. These multiple actions concertedly contribute to
activate skeletal muscle use of intramuscular fatty acid, fat oxidation,
plasma glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity, stimulates adipose tissue
NEFA mobilisation, and activates hepatic endogenous glucose production. Together these molecular factors are likely to contribute to the exercise health benefits, i.e. increase in muscle mass, reduced
triacylglycerolaemia, improved insulin sensitivity and glucose control.

studies but have not been (fully) confirmed in human studies.
Circulating levels of IL-6, the first myokine to be discovered
[38], rapidly increase in response to an acute bout of exercise
[39]. Its secretion seems to be influenced by the mechanical
workload of the exercise [39], skeletal muscle glycogen
content [40] and, potentially, glucose ingestion and/or plasma
glucose levels [41]. IL-6 may therefore act as an energy
sensor. In humans, exercise-released IL-6 stimulates the
mobilisation of intramuscular triacylglycerol [42], fatty acid
oxidation [42], translocation of GLUT4 from the cytosol to
the membrane [43] and improves skeletal muscle insulin
sensitivity [43].
Liver adaptations During short bouts of activity and highintensity exercise, muscles rely predominantly on intramuscular stores of glucose and fat. However, when exercise is
sustained, a larger supply of substrates from outside the
muscle is required [44]. The requirement of glucose uptake
for the working muscle must be paired with increased rates of
hepatic glucose output to maintain euglycaemia [44]. Exercise
therefore increases hepato-splanchnic glucose flux, an effect
that is not seen by sampling blood glucose, but, rather,
requires tracer methodology to measure glucose turnover/flux.
Exercise first increases the mobilisation of hepatic glycogen
(the biggest glycogen store in the body) into plasma, and this
is followed by increased rates of gluconeogenesis during
longer exercise bouts [45]. To fuel these processes, exercise
also increases the uptake of the gluconeogenic precursors
(lactate, pyruvate, glycerol) [46]. Exercise-induced changes
in gluconeogenesis are dependent on the rise in glucagon
and the drop in insulin that occur during exercise [44].
During each bout, the exercise-induced decrease in insulin
sensitises the liver to the effects of glucagon. Exercise training, in the absence of weight loss, improves the ability of
insulin to suppress glucose production by the liver [45]. As
in skeletal muscle, exercise stimulates a reduction in lipogenic
processes and a simultaneous increase in lipid oxidation
[47–49], which is likely to underlie the effects of habitual
exercise in the prevention of NAFLD and maintenance of
reduced intrahepatic lipid storage [19].
The liver faces other challenges during exercise, such as
recycling metabolites, clearing toxic compounds, and buffering the by-products of lipid oxidation released by the muscle
during exercise (e.g. medium-chain acylcarnitines) [45, 46].
The liver also produces ketones, which fuel neuronal tissues
during exercise if there has been a prolonged period since the
last meal [50]. Thus, via adaptive responses in glucose and
fatty acid metabolism, a well-controlled crosstalk exists
between the liver and muscles to exchange substrates and
maintain metabolic homeostasis during exercise.
Changes in liver metabolism during exercise are regulated,
at least in part, by exercise-released myokines. IL-6 enhances
hepatic fat oxidation and glucose production during exercise
[51]. Myonectin also improves systemic lipid metabolism. It
does so by increasing liver fatty acid uptake through upregulation of fatty acid transporter genes, at least in rodents [52]. In
addition, during and immediately after exercise, liver
hepatokines are released, including FGF21, follastin and
angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4), which are involved in the
regulation of circulating triacylglycerol concentrations, skeletal muscle mass and strength, and metabolism in rodents and
humans [45, 53].
Adipose tissue adaptations Whole-body fat oxidation rates
increase with prolonged exercise or physical activity, particularly in postabsorptive conditions. The energy demands of
muscles and the liver are met by NEFA mobilisation from
adipose tissues, the largest source of stored energy in the
human body. Increased mobilisation of NEFA from adipose,
paired with increased oxidation, permits sustained exercise by
delaying hypoglycaemia [54]. Moreover, increased NEFA
oxidation in the liver during exercise is necessary to fuel the
high energy costs of gluconeogenesis. Storage and
mobilisation of NEFA are under the control of insulin
(lipogenic and anti-lipolytic hormone) and catecholamines
(epinephrine and norepinephrine, lipolytic hormones) and
the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP, lipolytic factor) [55].
During exercise, levels of circulating catecholamines, via
sympathetic nervous system activation, and ANP release by
the heart are enhanced and the plasma insulin level is
decreased [56]. The combined action of these factors induces
lipolysis. Even low-intensity exercise is sufficient to increase
adipose tissue NEFA mobilisation [57]. Exercise training
improves the sensitivity of adrenergic receptors to catecholamines in adipose tissue [58], while also enhancing markers of
mitochondrial biogenesis and function [59], blood flow and
glucose uptake [60]. However, the improvements in adipose
tissue metabolism and in blood flow in response to acute exercise are less pronounced in overweight and obese adults than
in their lean healthy counterparts [61]. An acute bout of exercise also increases lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity [62].
Although this may appear counterintuitive given that LPL
stimulates fat storage in adipose tissue, it makes sense given
the effect of an increase in systemic and muscle LPL activity
[63] is the promotion of fat uptake by muscle. Importantly,
because this latter effect is long lasting (12–18 h) after a single
bout of activity [64], prior exercise reduces the net delivery of
dietary fat to adipose tissue (arterial triacylglycerol) [64] and,
potentially, fat storage. In line with this, exercise training leads
to a modest reduction in adiposity even in the absence of
weight loss [65]. Furthermore, it decreases two variables with
negative metabolic health outcomes, namely, central adiposity
(at least in men) [65] and fat cell size (at least when associated
with energy deficit). Although some studies suggested a greater effect of exercise on visceral than subcutaneous adipose
tissue mass, potentially because visceral adipose tissue mass
Diabetologia (2020) 63:1464–1474 1469

is more responsive to adrenergic activation [66], metaanalysis and reviews failed to report a differential effect on
fat depots [67]. The existence of an independent effect of
regular exercise on visceral adipose tissue is currently debated. Finally, exercise in rodents has been shown to lower
adipose inflammation, which tracks with improved wholebody insulin sensitivity [68]; however, data in humans suggest
that exercise-induced changes in adipose inflammation are
minimal unless paired with caloric restriction-induced weight
loss [69]. In summary, adipose tissue adaptations to exercise
together contribute to improved systemic metabolic homeostasis and improved exercise performance.
Muscle–adipose tissue crosstalk also exists. As reviewed
elsewhere [26], skeletal muscle release of IL-6, FGF-21 and
irisin increases in response to exercise and influences adipose
tissue metabolism, oxidative capacity and glucose uptake.
Following the depletion of glycogen stores, IL-6 is released
by the contracting muscles during exercise. IL-6 may stimulate adipose tissue lipolysis and NEFA mobilisation during
exercise, and plays a major role in the reduction of visceral
adipose tissue in response to exercise training in humans [70].
However, other in vivo and in vitro studies are not as conclusive, and the role of IL-6 in adipose tissue biology is still under
investigation. Similarly, the effects of muscle-released FGF21 and irisin on adipose tissue in humans are either still
unknown or under debate. A novel exerkine produced by
skeletal muscle contraction has recently been identified that
targets human adipose tissue to promote lipolysis, namely,
growth and differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) [71]. In terms
of adipose tissue, adipokines modulate inflammation, lipid
and glucose metabolism, blood pressure and atherosclerosis
[56]. Via its effect on fat mass, exercise can indirectly modulate levels of leptin and adiponectin, the two most well-studied
adipokines, which are positively and negatively associated
with fat mass, respectively. Although leptin and adiponectin
have been associated with insulin sensitivity, the specific
effect of exercise training on leptin and adiponectin is unclear
[56]. Recently, TGF-β2 has been shown to be secreted from
adipose tissue in response to exercise and play a role in
glucose homeostasis in mice [72]. Results still need to be
confirmed in humans.
Pancreas adaptations Pancreatic glucagon and insulin orchestrate the regulation of blood glucose by facilitating glucose
disposal in insulin-sensitive tissues and hepatic gluconeogenesis. Insulin secretion is primarily adjusted according to the
amount of glucose taken up by beta cells. Insulin secretion
during a glucose challenge is dramatically altered by exercise
undertaken during the previous days and hours in both healthy
individuals and in those with insulin resistance and type 2
diabetes [73]. Exercise cessation drives up insulin secretion,
while one bout of exercise can lower insulin secretion, showing that insulin secretion is tightly regulated by exercisedriven pathways [74]. The pancreas contributes to the capacity
of acute exercise to increase hepatic glucose production by
reducing insulin secretion (hepatic insulin clearance is also
likely to be important) and increasing glucagon secretion
[44]. In adults with impaired glucose tolerance and type 2
diabetes, exercise improves peripheral sensitivity and pancreatic beta cell function (greater insulin secretion in response to
circulating glucose) [75]. The combination of enhanced insulin sensitivity and improved beta cell function is defined as the
disposition index, which is the product of insulin sensitivity
multiplied by the amount of insulin secreted in response to
blood glucose [76]. Unlike drug therapies for type 2 diabetes,
which typically only influence one component of the index
independently, exercise has the capacity to improve the disposition index by enhancing both components [77]. Emerging
evidence shows that factors secreted from contracting skeletal
muscle boost beta cell insulin secretion and that the improvements in glucose homeostasis in type 2 diabetes patients in
response to chronic aerobic exercise may be more closely
related to improved beta cell function than insulin sensitivity
[78]. Although controversies still exist and mechanisms have
not been fully elucidated as yet, crosstalk between skeletal
muscle and pancreatic alpha and beta cells seems to exist via
myokines. Two of the proteins that have been proposed to
play a role in the muscle–pancreas crosstalk are musclereleased IL-6, because of its link with the protective effect of
exercise against proinflammatory-induced beta cell loss [79],
and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC1α)-dependent myokine irisin (precursor protein
fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 [FNDC5]),
because of its protective effect against beta cell apoptosis
induced by lipotoxic conditions [80]. Other unknown
exercise-induced myokines may also play a role in modulating
beta cell function. Further work in this area could highlight
novel therapeutic targets for type 2 diabetes.
Endothelium and cardiovascular system adaptations The
skeletal muscle microvascular ensures that delivery of oxygen
and substrates (NEFA, triacylglycerols-rich lipoproteins and
glucose) matches the metabolic demands of the muscle fibres
(and other metabolic tissues) under resting conditions and
during exercise. The microvasculature of human skeletal
muscles has a complex 3D structure and is subject to a large
number of complementary blood-flow regulation mechanisms, but the exact cascade of events and regulatory processes remain unknown, especially in humans [81, 82]. Because of
accessibility to tissues and the capacity to perform ex vivo
preparations, rodents have served as an important model to
explore the regulation of endothelial function and blood flow
in the control of skeletal muscle metabolism.
Under resting conditions, insulin increases microvascular
perfusion through both vasodilatory and vasoconstrictory
activities. On the one hand, insulin acts on terminal arterioles
1470 Diabetologia (2020) 63:1464–1474

and increases nutritive blood flow to skeletal muscle [83],
which can also result in increased blood flow in upstream
conduit arteries. On the other hand, data from rodents shows
that insulin-mediated endothelin-1 (ET-1) [84] increases the
vasoconstriction of arterioles that control access to the nutritive capillary beds of muscle, which receive little or no blood
flow in the basal state. ET-1 in skeletal muscle arterioles is
increased in individuals with obesity or type 2 diabetes
compared with healthy control individuals [85]. In addition,
there is evidence in humans [86] and rodents [87] that increasing insulin resistance is associated with reduced capillary
density. Although the vascular effects of insulin seem to be
markedly compromised in type 2 diabetes, exercise-mediated
pathways are likely to be maintained [88].
During exercise, there are increases in cardiac output, via a
rise in cardiac stroke and heart rate, and blood pressure. Acute
exercise increases muscle insulin sensitivity by a coordinated
increase in insulin-stimulated microvascular perfusion and
molecular signalling that improves glucose delivery and
increases muscle glucose uptake and disposal [89]. This
insulin-stimulated increase in microvascular perfusion is likely
to be linked to the exercise-mediated increases in muscle
membrane permeability to glucose and muscle blood flow
[90]. The increased haemodynamic forces, i.e. shear forces
exerted by blood flow, are also translated by the glycocalyx
layer (glycoproteins and proteoglycans) located on the luminal
surface of endothelium into a vasodilatory response. This
pulsatile flow-induced shear stress and release of nitric oxide
induces a dynamic regulation of vascular tone via ET-1
synthesis/release [91], which could also potentiate the nonnutritive route of the blood flow. Vasodilation and additional
microvascular units expand the endothelial surface area, thus
enabling the delivery of nutrients to the muscle. Exercise training reduces resting blood pressure, heart rate and cardiac hypertrophy, improves the vasodilator response of the muscle microvasculature to insulin and exercise [88] and enlarges the microvascular network via angiogenesis and arteriogenesis [81].
These adaptations have been linked to a variety of changes in
tissue metabolism and signalling, including the production and
release of nitric oxide and prostacyclin from the vascular endothelium [82]. The finding that vascular endothelial growth
factor B (VEGF-B) produced by skeletal muscle links endothelial NEFA uptake to the oxidative capacity of skeletal muscle
by controlling the expression of fatty acid transporter proteins
in the capillary endothelium represents a major recent discovery [92]. Regulation of the expression of these proteins may
prevent lipotoxic NEFA accumulation, the dominant cause of
insulin resistance in muscle fibres. The effects of exercise on
endothelial adaptations and the underlying mechanisms continue to be explored and much is yet to be learnt, especially related
to how adaptations occur in those with obesity or type 2 diabetes vs a non-diseased state [93, 94]. The ability of exercise to
influence endothelial transport of insulin and glucose [44] and
to mediate enhanced insulin-stimulated blood flow via both the
nutritive and non-nutritive routes [88] is likely to be particularly
important for the prevention of type 2 diabetes. Finally, emerging data from rodents indicate that exercise also positively
impacts endothelial function and vascular biology in adipose
depots [95] and is likely to play a role in other key organs, such
as the brain, liver and pancreas.
Conclusion
Regular exercise and/or moderate to vigorous physical activity has a pronounced protective effect against metabolic
disease. We posit that the multi-tissue adaptations induced
by exercise underly its powerful disease-modifying impact.
Detailed studies blocking individual effects in each tissue
using reductionist approaches may be needed to provide greater mechanistic insight. That being said, because exercise activates so many pathways in so many tissues, it may be that
target knockdown studies would not reveal that one metabolic
pathway is essential, but, rather like the layers of an onion,
multiple factors with built in redundancies contribute to the
metabolic protection provided by regular exercise.
Nevertheless, it is an exciting time to investigate and observe
how exercise mediates metabolic benefits beyond the mechanisms found in skeletal muscle.
