Prevalence in England of Antibody to Human
Polyomavirus (B.K.)

British Medical J'ournal, 1973, 1, 77-78
Summary
Over 500 human sera were tested by complement
fixation and haemagglutination inhibition tests for
antibody to the human polyomavirus (B.K.). Both tests
showed that antibody to this virus was very common in
the population and began to be acquired after the age of
1 year. No clinical illness has so far been associated with
the development of this antibody in a series of paired
sera from children.
Introduction
Gardner et al. (1971) described the isolation of a polyoma-like
virus (B.K.) from the urine of a Sudanese patient who developed
ureteric obstruction four months after a renal transplant
operation. The virus was recovered from his urine on five
separate occasions over a period of 16 days, and a noticeable
increase in antibody to this virus was found in serial sera obtained from him. Both the patient and his donor brother were
found to have antibody at the time of the transplant.
B.K. virus belongs to a group of animal viruses which have an
oncogenic potential. As it was isolated from man it was clearly of
importance to determine how common it was in the population
and whether it was associated with any particular clinical
condition.
A serological survey was therefore begun to assess the
prevalence in England of antibody to this apparently new virus
by the techniques of complement fixation and haemagglutination
inhibition.
The results of these investigations are presented in this report.
Materials and Methods
Serum Samples.-Over 500 sera were obtained from various
sources as follows: (a) single sera from infants, children, and
adults aged between 26 and 50 years submitted for cytomegalovirus studies or antistreptolysin 0 estimations; (b) sera from
healthy university students; (c) sera from healthy adult volunteers over the age of 50 years; (d) sera from healthy children
attending primary schools in North-west England, given by Dr.
D. Reid; and (e) paired sera from children suffering from a
variety of clinical illnesses, kindly supplied by Dr. M. H.
Hambling.
Antibody Tests.-Details of the preparation of antigens and
techniques used for the complement fixation (C.F.) and haemagglutination inhibition (H.I.) tests have been described (Gardner
et al., 1971). The H.I. test was slightly modified and a micromethod was used with unit volumes of 0-025 ml. Serial twofold dilutions of serum from 1/20 to 1/20,480 were made in
disposable plastic plates using Microtiter loops supplied by
Cooke Instruments Ltd., and 8-16 haemagglutinating units were
added to each serum dilution. Titres of 40 or more were regarded
as specific. In the C.F. test sera were screened initially at a
dilution of 1/8 and those showing fixation at this level were then
titrated. Sera from some age groups which were C.F.-negative
at this dilution were retested at lower dilutions when H.I.
antibody was shown to be present.
Results
The distribution of C.F. and H.I. antibody to B.K. virus at
various ages is shown in Tables I and II.

The results with both tests showed that a substantial proportion of people in England have antibody to this virus. This
developed rapidly after the age of 1 year, and in this series by
the age of 10 years 71% of children had C.F. antibody and 83%
had H.I. antibody.
The proportion of persons with C.F. antibody began to
decline after the age of 50 years, and after the age of 25 years
the titres were, on the whole, lower. By the age of 50 years only
33 % of people had titres of 8 or more. When titres of 2 or more
were considered, this percentage rose to 53. Both values are
shown in table I.
The H.I. test is a more sensitive method than the C.F. for
detecting antibody. The percentage of persons with H.I.
antibody in the older age groups was only slightly lower than
that seen in children and young adults.
Generally there was good correlation between the results of
the two tests. Sera with the highest C.F. titres had correspondingly
high H.I. titres. It was possible to find H.I. antibody in all C.F.-
positive sera with the exception of two C.F.-positive infants.
One mentally retarded infant of 9 months and a second infant
aged 10 months with jaundice had C.F. titres of 16 and 8
respectively but neither had developed H.I. antibody. Another
mentally retarded infant aged 4 months had a C.F. titre of 1/2
and an H.I. titre of 1/40. In this case the low levels of antibody
may have been passively acquired from the mother.

Since many of the sera tested were from ill children these
results might not give a true picture of the prevalence of antibody. Sera from a group of healthy primary schoolchildren
were therefore examined and, as shown in table II, the
incidence of antibody in this group was of a similar order.
The highest incidence of antibody to B.K. virus occurred
between the ages of 6 and 17 years. It is also in this age range
that the proportion of sera with high H.I. titres of 2,560 or
greater were found (table II). The highest C.F. titres were
observed in the age group 1-10 years. These findings suggest
that the virus is actively transmitted throughout the period of
childhood.
In an attempt to associate infection with some clinical
condition a small number of paired sera were examined. These
were obtained from children suffering from a wide range of
undiagnosed illnesses of a possible viral aetiology. No seroconversions or fourfold increase in titres were found (table III),
and the distribution of antibody was similar to that in other
groups.

Discussion
It has been known for some time that polyoma-like viruses may
exist in man. ZuRhein and Chou (1965) described particles,
morphologically identical with polyomaviruses, which they
observed in brain cells in a rare neurological disease-progressive
multifocal leucoencephalopathy.
All attempts to culture this virus were unsuccessful until, by
using human fetal glial cells, Padgett et al. (1971) reported the
isolation of a virus (J.C.) from a brain extract of a patient with
progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy. This virus appeared
to be unrelated to the mouse polyomavirus and simian virus 40
(SV40). The frequency of antibody to this J.C. virus in the
general population has not been described.
Further virus isolations from two additional cases ofprogressive
multifocal leucoencephalopathy have been reported (Weiner
et al., 1972). In these cases the viruses isolated were thought to
be identical with SV40.
Antibody to SV40 virus has been found in sera from persons
who received contaminated poliovaccine or who had contact
with monkeys, both known sources of this virus. It has also
been found in persons not in these categories (Shah, 1972).
However, the number of persons with antibody has been found
to be small and the titres low. This suggested that if another
source of SV40 exists or if there is an antigenically identical
human virus, infection is not common. Shah et al. (1971)
suggested the possibility that the antibody detected in these
persons might be the result of a cross-reaction with another
member of the polyoma-SV40 group of viruses.
With the report of the isolation of the polyoma-like virus
(B.K.) from the urine of an immunosuppressed patient it was
evident that infection can occur in man without involving the
central nervous system. In this patient virus particles were
found by electron microscopy in infected ureteric cells as well
as in the urine (Gardner et al., 1971). The presence of antibody
before the renal transplant in both patient and donor suggested
that the virus could be common in man and with immunosuppressive therapy could become activated.
The serological results presented in this paper indicate that
infection with B.K. virus is indeed widespread. However, no
clinical illness has so far been associated with the infection nor
is it known yet how the virus is transmitted.

Summary
When breathing air, the average arterial oxygen tension
in eight patients with acute pulmonary oedema was significantly higher than in eight other patients suffering
from an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, but the
mixed venous oxygen tension was very similar in both
groups. This largely arose from the smalier arterioUniversity of Edinburgh, Department of Medicine, Royal Infirmary,

venous difference of oxygen content in the bronchitic
cases, presumably due to their higher cardiac output,
associated with raised arterial CO2 tensions. Oxygen
therapy (60-90% for pulmonary oedema, 30% for the
bronchitics) raised the mixed venous oxygen tensions to
a similar level in both groups. We suggest that the major
need for oxygen therapy lies in patients who maintain
their oxygen consumption but show a reduction in
mixed venous tension when breathing air. Although
partial correction of arterial hypoxaemia is adequate in
chronic bronchitis-in which the cardiac output is maintained-high concentrations of oxygen are necessary in
pulmonary oedema, in which the cardiac output is low.
Introduction
Most agree that hypoxia should be corrected in both acute and
pulmonary oedema and in acute exacerbations of chronic bronProtected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies.
