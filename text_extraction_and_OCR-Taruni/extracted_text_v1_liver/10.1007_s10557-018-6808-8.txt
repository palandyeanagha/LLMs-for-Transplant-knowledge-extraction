Introduction
Thiamine (vitamin B1) is an essential water-soluble vitamin
required for cellular energy production. Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) is a coenzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway
for transketolation of glucose-6-phosphate to ribose-5-phosphate. In the Kreb’s cycle, TPP is needed for the functioning
of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (which converts pyruvate to acetyl CoA) and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase
(which converts alpha-ketoglutarate to succinate). These reactions are needed for aerobic metabolism and production of
ATP. Thiamine also helps in the conduction of nerve impulses,
independent of its coenzyme functions. It is important for
maintenance of nerve membrane stability and modulates
membrane ion channels for efficient nerve conduction [1].
Humans neither synthesize thiamine nor store it in large
quantities [2]. Thus, oral intake is the primary determinant
of thiamine stores in the body. As per the 1980 Committee
on Dietary Allowance, Food, and Nutrition Board, the recommended daily allowance of thiamine for adults is about 1.2 mg
daily for men and 1 mg daily for women [3]. Thiamine levels
can be estimated in different ways. Direct measurement of
serum thiamine is not a reliable indicator of total body thiamine stores as most of it is present inside the cells. The erythrocyte transketolase activity (ETKA) is an indirect measure of
thiamine levels in the body and has high sensitivity as erythrocytes are the first cell line to be affected by low thiamine
levels [4]. Another useful method is high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) to directly measure TPP concentration in erythrocytes.
Deficiency of thiamine is far more common in underdeveloped and developing countries due to high incidence of
poor nutritional status. In developed countries, thiamine deficiency is seen in patients with chronic alcohol use, patients on
total parenteral nutrition, and in patients who have undergone
weight loss surgery. Clinical signs of marginal thiamine deficiency are non-specific, like anorexia, weight loss, fatigue,
sleep disorders, and depression [5]. Severe thiamine deficiency in diet causes beriberi. Dry beriberi presents as a symmetric
peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy. On the other hand, the
major manifestations of wet beriberi are tachycardia,
cardiomegaly, high-output heart failure, and pedal edema, in
addition to neuropathy. Direct impairment of myocardial energy production has been proposed as a possible basis for the
development of heart failure state seen in beriberi (because of
loss of thiamine’s beneficial role in metabolic reactions) [6].
Decreased activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase due to thiamine
deficiency results in build-up of pyruvate, which is then
shunted towards anaerobic conversion into lactate [7]. This
accumulation of lactate causes a decrease in peripheral resistance, thereby increasing venous return to the heart (preload).
This increase in preload coupled with myocardial dysfunction
has been proposed to be a basis of congestive heart failure in
thiamine deficiency [8].
Heart failure is a major cause of mortality and morbidity in
the West. Around 6.5 million Americans have heart failure and
nearly a million new cases are being identified annually [9].
Though thiamine supplementation is recommended in highoutput heart failure state seen in severe thiamine deficiency,
its utility in the heart failure patients at large is unclear. Heart
failure being a prominent feature of thiamine deficiency, several
investigators have evaluated the potential of thiamine therapy in
heart failure patients. In this review, we aim to discuss the utility
of thiamine therapy in patients with heart failure.
Thiamine Deficiency in Heart Failure
Multiple studies have shown that thiamine deficiency is more
prevalent in heart failure patients than that in general population [10]. In a meta-analysis of nine observational studies,
irrespective of the type of assay used for measuring thiamine

(ETKA or TPP-HPLC), the incidence of thiamine deficiency
in patients with heart failure has been reported to be higher
compared to that of control subjects without heart failure (OR
2.53 [95% CI 1.65–3.87]). The incidence of thiamine deficiency has ranged from 3 to 91% in various studies conducted
in both inpatient and outpatient settings [10]. Some of the
proposed mechanisms for thiamine deficiency in heart failure
are (a) decreased thiamine intake and its poor absorption due
to cardiac cachexia and splanchnic congestion, (b) increased
urinary excretion related to use of diuretics, and (c) altered
thiamine metabolism. The increased urinary excretion of thiamine in patients with heart failure who are on high-dose loop
diuretics, such as furosemide, is thought to be the most important factor contributing to thiamine deficiency in these patients
(Fig. 1) [11].
The first study to analyze thiamine deficiency in humans
on high-dose furosemide was conducted by Seligmann et al.
[12] in 1991. They selected 23 hospitalized heart failure patients, who were being treated with high-dose furosemide (80–
240 mg for a duration ranging from 3 to 14 months) and
compared the incidence of thiamine deficiency with control
group (non-heart failure patients, n = 16). Out of the 23 heart
failure patients on furosemide, 21 had thiamine deficiency
measured by ETKA, compared to 2 out of 16 in control group
(P < 0.001). Urinary thiamine levels were inappropriately elevated in the furosemide-treated heart failure patients compared to those of the control group. Rieck et al. [13] also
suggested that increased urinary flow is a likely cause of increased urinary thiamine excretion. In their study, six healthy
adults were treated with varied doses of intravenous furosemide; urinary thiamine excretion increased in these patients
with furosemide use and then returned to baseline after furosemide use was stopped. Importantly, urinary thiamine excretion was found to be proportional to urinary flow rate.
A counter argument to these proposed mechanisms is that
heart failure itself is a risk factor for thiamine deficiency and
the presence of thiamine deficiency with high furosemide
doses merely indicates the severity of heart failure [10].
Zenuk et al. [14] studied this concept in 32 patients with heart
failure who were on at least 40 mg/day of furosemide per day
for 3 months. They found that patients who received > 80 mg/
day had a significantly higher incidence of thiamine deficiency (24 of 25 patients) compared to those who were on a lower
dose of furosemide (4 of 7 patients). Thus, thiamine deficiency may be more common when high doses of furosemide (>
80 mg per day) are used for long periods.
However, not all diuretics cause a decline in thiamine levels
as seen with furosemide. Rocha et al. [15] selected 22 ambulatory patients with NYHA III/IV heart failure on high-dose
loop diuretics. They observed that patients on spironolactone,
in addition to loop diuretics, had significantly higher thiamine
levels than those who were only on loop diuretics (p < 0.001).
This led to the conclusion that factors in addition to increased
urinary excretion may be playing a role in inducing thiamine
deficiency in patients treated with loop diuretics.
There are no reliable human studies that specifically evaluated thiamine absorption and metabolism in heart failure patients. However, animal experiments have shown that thiamine depletion causes increased reactive oxygen species concentrations and increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis [16, 17].
In essence, the overall incidence of thiamine deficiency
was consistently found to be high in heart failure patients
when compared to that of non-heart failure controls, perhaps
related to use of large doses of loop diuretics in the former. It
may be postulated that thiamine deficiency may worsen heart
failure state in these patients [11, 14]. However, the evidence
for loop diuretics causing thiamine deficiency is limited due to
the small sample size studies.

Effect of Thiamine Supplementation
in Chronic Systolic Heart Failure
Based on the observations of thiamine deficiency, several small
trials have been conducted to determine the effects of thiamine
supplementation in patients with heart failure (Table 1). In almost all studies, patients with identifiable causes of thiamine
deficiency like alcoholism, malnutrition, and catabolic state, as
well as those on vitamin supplements, were excluded. In the
study by Seligmann et al. [12], six heart failure patients were
treated with intravenous thiamine for 7 days. Functional capacity improved by at least one NYHA class in all six patients.
Also, the left ventricular ejection fraction increased from 24.0 ±
4.3% to 37.0 ± 2.4% in four of five patients studied by echocardiography, and was unchanged in the remaining patient.
Though this was the first study to examine this concept, the
intervention was without any placebo control.
Pfitzenmeyer et al. studied 35 hospitalized geriatric (age
76–95 years) heart failure patients who were age- and sexmatched with controls, i.e., 35 hospitalized geriatric patients
without heart failure. There was no difference in the baseline
thiamine status between the heart failure group and the nonheart failure group. Of note, only 20 of the heart failure patients were on furosemide, dose range 20–40 mg/day in this
study. The heart failure patients were then divided into two
groups and randomly allocated to either receive thiamine therapy or not receive thiamine. After 7 days, there was no significant difference in NYHA class or the clinical status between
thiamine-treated heart failure patients and patients not treated
with thiamine. The low dose of furosemide used, absence of
significant thiamine deficiency in the study population at
baseline, and absence of echocardiographic evaluation limit
the generalizability of this study [5].
Recently, Jikrona et al. performed a cross-sectional prospective observational analysis on 32 male patients with stage II
heart failure on prolonged diuretic therapy. Sixteen of these
32 patients received 300 mg/day of thiamine for 28 days. The
authors reported a 13.5% increase in ejection fraction in thiamine recipients (p = 0.021) when compared to heart failure
patients who did not get thiamine supplementation [18].
However, this study is marred by lack of defined inclusion
criteria, unclear dose and duration of furosemide use among
patients, and poor representation of echocardiographic data
and results.
Shimon et al. randomized 30 hospitalized heart failure patients secondary to myocardial ischemia and administered intravenous thiamine for 7 days or placebo in a double-blind
manner followed by 6 weeks of oral thiamine 200 mg/day in
all patients [19]. Only patients who were on at least 80 mg or
more of furosemide for minimum of 3 months were included
in the study. The study showed an increase in left ventricular
ejection fraction (28 ± 0.11% to 32 ± 0.09%, p < 0.05) in the
thiamine group at the end of 7 days. However, it is unclear
from the study whether this improvement in left ventricular
ejection fraction was significant compared to that in the placebo group. In addition, 27 patients who completed the full
intervention (including 6 weeks of oral thiamine) had a 22%
increase in ejection fraction as compared to the baseline value
(p < 0.01). Small sample size and high degree of variability in
left ventricular ejection fraction and lack of a clear comparison
to the placebo group are some of the limitations of this study.
Likewise, Schoenenberger et al. in a randomized doubleblind placebo-controlled cross-over study in nine symptomatic patients with heart failure were able to demonstrate an increase in left ventricular ejection fraction from 29.5 to 32.8%
(p = 0.024) after supplementation with oral thiamine 300 mg/
day for 28 days [20]. There was also a non-significant improvement in walking time in six of nine patients. A washout
period of 6 weeks was given between cross-over from thiamine to placebo or from placebo to thiamine. Free thiamine
concentration was measured in the study using HPLC.
Though, by using a cross-over study design, the investigators
were able to account for inter-individual variabilities, it is
unclear whether 6 weeks of washout period is enough to reinstate thiamine deficiency in placebo group who were previously treated with thiamine supplementation prior to crossover. In addition, small sample size and short follow-up period
are other limitations.

A meta-analysis of the above-mentioned randomized,
double-blind placebo-controlled trials [19, 20] showed a small
increase in left ventricular ejection fraction (3.28%, 95% CI
0.64–5.93%, I
2 = 0%) with thiamine therapy in heart failure
patients compared to placebo [21]. Given the small sample size
and inherent limitations within the individual studies, the results
of this meta-analysis should be interpreted cautiously.
In a more recent study, Mousavi et al. randomized 52 patients with heart failure (left ventricular ejection fraction <
40%) who were already on optimal medical therapy to receive
300 mg/day of thiamine or a matching placebo for a period of
1 month [22]. No significant difference was observed in either
systolic or diastolic echocardiographic parameters, or dyspnea
between these patient groups. However, patients in the thiamine group showed significant improvement in peripheral
edema (34.6 vs 3.8%, p = 0.005). It is to be noted that the
proportion of patients who were on furosemide in this study
was low (10 out of 52) and the dose of furosemide was not
reported. Further, spironolactone was prescribed to most (22
out of 26) patients in the thiamine group which may have
caused a decrease in the incidence of thiamine deficiency in
this cohort. Unlike furosemide, spironolactone use has been
shown to be associated with a small increase in blood thiamine
level in patients who are on loop diuretics [15]. Further, thiamine levels were not obtained at any point in this study.
The reasons for the variations in the results from multiple
studies may be due to a wide range of incidence of thiamine
deficiency in heart failure patients, small sample size, and
geographical and environmental factors.
Conclusion
It is known that thiamine supplementation significantly improves heart failure state caused by severe thiamine deficiency, but it is not clear if thiamine supplementation will be useful
in patients with heart failure at large. The preliminary studies
presented here suggest that it may be prudent to screen all
patients with heart failure for thiamine deficiency. Those
who exhibit low thiamine levels may be given thiamine supplementation. High oral doses often result in high blood concentrations [23]. Thiamine is a relatively safe drug and no
major side effects have been reported at high doses in the
range of 300–900-mg daily dose. With low cost and relatively
few side effects, it is likely that thiamine supplementation may
be useful in some patients, especially those on high doses of
loop diuretics. Notably, majority of the studies on thiamine
supplementation conducted until to date are old, and were
conducted before the establishment of contemporary therapies. Further, these studies were of small sample size and short
duration. There is lack of good-quality data on improvement
in functional status of the patients after thiamine supplementation; this is especially important as symptoms of thiamine
deficiency are often non-specific. High-quality large sample
size, long duration, and randomized control studies are essential to suggest or refute the routine use of thiamine. Based on
the available evidence, it is not unreasonable to evaluate heart
failure patients for thiamine deficiency, or even empirically
provide thiamine supplementation to heart failure patients on
high doses of furosemide.
