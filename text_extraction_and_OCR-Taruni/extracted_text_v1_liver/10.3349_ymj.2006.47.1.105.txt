The five-year survival rate of patients after curative
resection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been reported
to be 30 to 50 %, however the actual survival rate may be
different. We analyzed the actual 5-year survival rate and
prognostic factors after curative resection of HCC. Retrospective analysis was performed on 63 HCC patients who underwent curative resection from 1998 to 1999. A total of 63 cases
were reviewed, consisting of 53 men and 10 women, with a
median age of 49 years. These cases included all four pathologic T stages (pT stage) and had the following representation:
stage 1 (1 case), stage 2 (17 cases), stage 3 (38 cases), and
stage 4 (7 cases). In our study, the actual 5-year survival rate
was 57.0% and the median survival time was 60 months. In
addition, the patients in our study had an actual 5-year diseasefree survival rate of 50.2% and a median disease-free survival
time of 46 months. Thirty-one patients had recurrences, with
a majority occurring within one year (65%). These patients
with early recurrences had a poor actual 5-year survival rate
of 5%. A univariate analysis showed that the prognostic factors
influencing survival rate were the presence of satellite nodules,
increased pT stage, HCC recurrence, and the time to recurrence (within one year). Interestingly, microvascular invasion
made a difference in survival rate but was not statistically
significant (p = 0.08). Furthermore, factors influencing the
disease free survival rate include the presence of satellite
nodules, microvascular invasion, and pT stage. Multivariate
analysis identified pT stage as the only statistically related
factor in determining the disease-free survival rate. The most
important prognostic factor of HCC is recurrence. Moreover,
the major risk factor for recurrence is an advanced pT stage.
Therefore, performing prospective studies of postoperative
adjuvant therapy is necessary to prevent recurrences after
hepatic resection. Furthermore, active preventative treatment
and early diagnosis of recurrences should be of the highest
priority in the care of high-risk patient groups that have an
advanced pT stage.

INTRODUCTION
The best therapeutic modality for hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) is a curative resection. However,
the percent of patients able to be resected is
reported to be between 10 and 50% due to
impaired liver function and delayed diagnosis.
1-3
Recently, the incidence of hepatic resection has
increased due to the development of imaging
modalities, early diagnosis by screening high risk
groups with serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) for
protein-induced vitamin K absence or antagonistII (PIVKA-II), increased understanding of liver
anatomy, and the development of hepatic resection techniques. Due to the increasing rates of
hepatic resection, many reports on results of these
resections have been published. Such studies
report that the five-year cumulative survival rate
after hepatic resection for HCC is 55 to 60% in
Korea,
4-6
and 30 to 50% in other countries.
7-11
While the actual 5-year survival rates are rarely
reported limited studies have reported these rates
to be to be about 30 to 50%.
12-14
These statistics
reveal a difference between the actual 5-year survival rate and the statistical survival rate. These
differences are thought to result from factors
affecting survival rates after hepatic resection.
Even though a great number of studies have
searched for prognostic factors of HCC after
hepatic resection, the results of these studies vary

In this study, we analyzed the actual 5-year
survival rates and prognostic factors for patients
with HCC who underwent curative resection and
had more than 5 years of follow-up care in the
Severance Hospital of the Yonsei University
College of Medicine.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
We examined the medical records of 66 HCC
patients who underwent hepatic resection from
January, 1998 to December, 1999 in our institution
and who had more than 5 years of follow-up care.
Three patients were excluded from the study. Two
of the three excluded patients died of postoperative complications from hepatic failure, and the
third had an obvious residual tumor at the time
of surgery and underwent palliative resection
after several treatments of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for multiple HCC. A retrospective analysis was performed using operation
records and pathologic reports. Five years after
hepatic resection, we investigated the survival
status and evaluated both the long-term and
disease-free survival rates in these patients.
The preoperative studies included screening for
serum tumor markers using AFP and/or PIVKAII), analysis of residual liver function using a liver
function test and the indocyanine green retention
rate at 15 minutes (ICG R15), and finally, radiological imaging studies by either ultrasonogram,
computerized tomography scan (CT-scan), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or hepatic artery
angiogram. Preoperative PIVKA-II levels were not
determined during the study period.
The HCC pathologic stage, both pre- and postoperatively, was defined according to the modified UICC stages outlined by the Korean Liver
Cancer Study Group (Table 1). All patients were
monitored regularly for recurrences by serum
AFP screening and CT-scans at the out-patient
clinics. Recurrence was diagnosed when imaging
studies showed a hypervascular nodule or was
diagnosed as HCC by a radiologist.
20,21
Follow-up
periods lasted between 4 and 85 months with a
median follow-up period of 62 months for the
entire study.
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS
(Windows, version 11.5) and all calculations are
reported as median values. Survival and diseasefree survival rates were calculated by the KaplanMeier method. Univariate analysis was performed
using a log-rank test, and multivariate analysis
was performed using Cox's proportional hazard
model. Statistical significance was defined as p <
0.05.
RESULTS
Clinical findings, preoperative study, and treatment
A total of 63 patients, 53 male and 10 female,
were reviewed. The ages of the patients in this
study ranged from 26 to 69 years with a median
age of 49. Fifty-eight patients had chronic hepatitis, with 53 of these cases derived from B-viral
infection. In addition, 27 patients had liver cirrhosis, while 23 cases had macronodular cirrhosis.
The median preoperative serum AFP level was
17.8 IU/mL (ranging from 0.5 to 50,000). Sixty-one

injection (6 cases), systemic chemotherapy (2
cases), and surgical resection (1 case).
Preoperative T stage was defined by imaging
studies. The number of patients per stage was as
follows: stage 1, 5 cases, stage 2, 51 cases, and
stage 3, 7 cases (Table 2).
Operation types and pathologic findings
Twenty-four patients had received a lobectomy,
and thirty-nine had received a segmentectomy or
wedge resection.
The median tumor size was 5 cm and ranged
from 1.0 to 15.0 cm. Thirty-four patients had
tumors less than 5 cm. Multiple nodules were
noted in the gross findings of five patients, and
in 11 patients, satellite nodules were found by
microscopy. Thirty-eight patients had microvascular invasion. The median distance from the
tumor to the resection margin was 1.35 cm (ranging from 0 to 7.0 cm).
The number of cases in each pathologic T stage
(pT stage) was as follows: stage 1, 1 case, stage 2,
17 cases, stage 3, 38 cases, and stage 4, 7 cases
(Table 3).
Survival rate and factors affecting survival
The actual 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were
85.7%, 69.8%, and 57.0%, respectively The median
survival time was 58 months. The actual 1-, 3-,
and 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates were
68.1%, 51.9%, and 50.2%, respectively. The median
DFS time was 46 months (Fig. 1). A total of 31
patients (49.2%) had recurrences.
A univariate analysis showed the prognostic
factors for survival were the presence of satellite
nodules (p = 0.03), pT stage (p = 0.02), recurrence
(p < 0.01), time to recurrence (p < 0.01), and extrahepatic metastasis (p = 0.02). In contrast, tumor
number and the presence of microvascular invasion were not statistically significant factors (Table
4). Patient age, ICG R15 values, AFP levels, preoperative treatments, extent of hepatic resection,
intraoperative transfusions, tumor size and surgical margins were also not significant factors.
Univariate analysis revealed that the following
factors affected DFS rates: tumor number (p =
0.046), the presence of satellite nodules (p = 0.013),
microvascular invasion (p = 0.035), and pT stage
(p= 0.02) (Table 5).
Multivariate analysis showed that pT stage was
the only factor affecting survival rate, and that no
factors affected DFS (Table 6).

tistical Office, in 2002, HCC was the third most
common malignancy in Korea. Curative resection
is the most effective therapy for HCC. However,
many HCC patients are not able to have resections
and show poor prognosis due to many factors.
These factors include difficulty in achieving an
early diagnosis, multiplicity, vascular invasion,
and advanced liver cirrhosis. Recently, the incidence of hepatic resection has been increased by
early diagnosis through screening high risk
groups, improving imaging study modalities such
as CT-scans or MRI, having an increased understanding of liver anatomy, developing surgical
techniques and instruments, improving perioperative management, and decreasing the high rate of
postoperative complications and mortalities. Despite these advances, long-term survival rates
remain low because of high recurrence rates.
Until now, the 5-year cumulative survival rate
was reported as 30 to 60%,
4-11
and the actual 5-
year survival rate was reported as 30 to 50%.
12-14
Subjects of this study are patients with HCC who
underwent hepatic resection during a two year
period from January 1998 until December 1999.
According to this study, the actual 5-year survival
rate is 57%, which is higher than previous studies,
and is similar to or better than the cumulative
survival rate reported recently in other studies.
The actual 5-year DFS rate in this study is 50%,
which is similar to or better than the 15 to 50%
5-year DFS rate reported in other studies.
All previous studies have reported different
prognostic factors affecting the long term survival
after HCC resection. The factors found in these
studies include: HBsAg, HBeAg, AFP, Child-Pugh
classification, ICG R15, perioperative transfusion,
intrahepatic tumor characteristics, tumor size and
number, satellite nodules, vascular invasion, resection margin distance, and stage.
4-19
In this study, we classified pT stages according
to the modified UICC stages defined by the
Korean liver cancer study group. Multiplicity was
defined as the gross presence of multiple nodules
or the presence of satellite nodules that were
observed by microscopy. Vascular invasion was
defined as either the gross or microscopic presence of vascular invasion. Large differences
between pT stage and preoperative T stage were
present because the preoperative T stage did not
include microscopic findings such as microscopic
satellite nodules and microvascular invasion.
In this study, there were differences in the 5-
year survival rate of patients with microvascular
invasions and with an increased tumor number.
However, these factors were not statistically
significant (0.05 < p 0.1). The five-year survival
rate of patients who did not have satellite nodules
was 63.2%. Interestingly, this rate is much higher
than that of patients who had satellite nodules (p
= 0.034). The 5-year survival rate was lowered significantly in patients with a high pT stage. In a multivariate analysis, pT stage was the only prognostic factor. Thus, three factors, such as tumor size,
tumor number, and vascular invasion, affect tumor
stage cumulatively rather than independently.
Tumor recurrence is the most important prognostic factor in HCC. Recurrence is classified as
either early or late. Early recurrence is defined as
recurrence within 12 months or 3 years and consists of a residual tumor that has spread from the
primary tumor remaining in the residual liver. In
contrast, late recurrence results from multicentric
tumor development.
7
Prognosis is worse in cases
of early recurrence or concurrent extrahepatic
metastasis.
7
In this study, we defined early recurrence as a tumor recurring within one year after
curative resection. Thirty-one out of 63 patients
(49%) in our study had recurrences, and the 5-

year survival rate of patients with recurrences
(19.4%) was much lower than those of patients
who did not have recurrences (93.4%). Twenty
patients (65%) had recurrences within 1 year. The
5-year survival rate of these patients with early
recurrences was significantly lower than the five
year survival rate of patients who had recurrences
after 1 year (5% versus 45.5%, respectively).
Nineteen of 31 patients who had recurrences
within 1 year had a high pT stage (pT3, 16 cases,
pT4, 3 cases). Fourteen patients exhibited microvascular invasion, while 10 patients had tumors
greater than 10 cm in diameter.
The five-year survival rate of patients with
extrahepatic metastasis was 5.9%. This rate was
lower than that of patients without extrahepatic
metastasis (38.5%). Seventeen patients with extrahepatic metastasis showed pT3 (15 cases) and
pT4 (2 cases), while 12 of these patients exhibited
microvascular invasion.
Some studies have found that the factors affecting tumor recurrence are: AFP, tumor number
and size, satellite nodules, portal vein invasion,
and microvascular invasion.
6,9,10
In contrast, other
studies did not find any significant factors.
12
In
this study, tumor number, satellite nodules, and
microvascular invasion significantly affected the
5- year DFS. These are the same factors that were
found in other studies. However, in our study no
significant factors were found using multivariate
analysis.
Factors that were found to affect survival and
recurrence rates in previous studies were not
statistically significant in this study. These factors
included: age, ICG R15, preoperative treatment,
AFP, intraoperative transfusion, type of hepatic
resection, tumor size, and resection margin distance.
In this study, the 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival
rates of HCC patients after hepatic resection were
85.7%, 69.8%, and 57.0%, respectively, and the 1-,
3-, and 5-year DFS rates were 68.1%, 51.9%, and
50.2%, respectively. Recurrences, especially then
they occurred within 1 year, were the most adverse prognostic factor in long-term survival rates.
The pathologic characteristics of HCC (satellite or
multiple nodule and microvascular invasion) were
found to be significantly adverse prognostic factors. Moreover, tumor recurrence was affected by
the pT stage. Early recurrence and extrahepatic
metastasis were more frequent in patients with
higher pT stages. Hence, reducing early recurrences requires an aggressive treatment strategy
that includes postoperative adjuvant therapy. Furthermore, in patients with high pT stages, prospective study is needed for adequate adjuvant
therapy.
In conclusion, the rate of HCC recurrences after
resection is high, and recurrences are the most
adverse prognostic factor of HCC. However until
now, postoperative adjuvant therapy was not
established for prevention of recurrence. Therefore, the prospective study of postoperative adjuvant therapy is necessary for the prevention of
recurrences after hepatic resection. In high-risk
groups such as patients with advanced pT stages,
effort should be put forth to look for early
recurrences while an active strategy for recurrence
prevention should be implemented in follow-up
treatment regimens.
