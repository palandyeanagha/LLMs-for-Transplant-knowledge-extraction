Second Serial Transverse Enteroplasty Procedure in an Infant 
with Extreme Short Bowel Syndrome
The serial transverse enteroplasty (STEP) procedure is a novel technique to lengthen and 
taper the bowel in patients with short bowel syndrome. The advantages of STEP include 
not only technical ease and simplicity, but also the ability to repeat the procedure. Herein, 
we report a case of extreme short bowel syndrome that was successfully treated by the 
second STEP procedure. A 3-day old newborn girl underwent STEP because of jejunal 
atresia with the small bowel length of 15 cm, but her bowel elongation was not enough to 
escape from short bowel syndrome. At the age of 6 months, she underwent a second STEP 
procedure. The bowel lengthening by the second STEP made her tolerable to enteral 
feeding with body weight gain and rescued her from short bowel syndrome. This case 
showed that second STEP is very helpful in treatment of extreme short bowel syndrome.

INTRODUCTION
Since the introduction of serial transverse enteroplasty (STEP) 
in 2003 (1), this procedure has become popular in the surgical 
management of short bowel syndrome because of its easy and 
simple operative technique (2, 3). However, in cases of extreme 
short bowel, the lengthening of the bowel from one STEP is not 
enough to escape from short bowel syndrome. Recent studies 
have reported that STEP could be performed again as a second 
procedure after primary STEP (4-7). 
Herein, we present a case of extreme short bowel syndrome 
that was successfully treated by the second STEP procedure.
CASE DESCRIPTION
A 2.63-kg, 36-week gestation female neonate was born by elective cesarean delivery. At the third day of life, she underwent 
laparotomy and high jejunal atresia was found (Fig. 1). The proximal bowel was only 10 cm in length from the Treitz ligament 
with dilatation, and the distal bowel was 5 cm in length from 
the ileocecal valve. STEP was performed using 6 Endo GIA staplers on the proximal small bowel that resulted in an increase 
in intestinal length from 10 cm to 15 cm. The entire small bowel 
length was 20 cm after primary anastomosis with the distal 
small bowel (Fig. 2). Postoperatively, parenteral nutrition was 
discontinued because of cholestatic jaundice, but she was able 
to gain weight very slowly by enteral feeding, even though she 
needed intravenous electrolyte solution to prevent dehydration. By 6 months of age, the patient’s body weight had increased 
to 3.71 kg, but she still required intravenous electrolyte solution 
and her small bowel was dilated again. As a result, we decided 
to perform the second STEP. The patient had relatively even dilatation of the small bowel with 4-5 cm in width. The previous 
proximal small bowel had gained length, from 15 cm to 30 cm, 
and the distal small bowel had grown from 5 cm to 12 cm. The 
second STEP was performed using 5 Endo GIA staplers on the 
previous proximal small bowel that resulted in an increase in 
intestinal length from 30 cm to 45 cm. The entire small bowel 
length was 57 cm (Fig. 3). After the second STEP procedure, the 
patient was tolerable to enteral feeding with body weight gain. 
At 8 months of age (2 months after the second STEP), her body 
weight was 4.41 kg after weaning the intravenous fluid, and she 
was discharged from the hospital. At the age of 2 yr, she has 
shown good growth and her body weight has increased to 9.8 kg, 
although her body weight is still in the low percentile of the 
growth chart (4th percentile) and she has developed vitamin D 
deficiency.
DISCUSSION
In the management of short bowel syndrome, the length of the 
small intestine is one of the important treatment factors (8). Although few reports have shown successful results in the short 
segment of the intestine, favorable outcomes are usually seen

in cases of relatively long segments of intestine (9). For this reason, various types of intestinal lengthening procedures have 
been developed (10-12). STEP, the most recently developed 
method, is favored for its simple technical feasibility (3). Originally this procedure was designed for longstanding short bowel 
syndrome patients with a dilated small bowel, and it could easily be adapted to newborn patients who have proximal jejunal 
atresia with short dilated residual small bowel (6, 13), such as 
our case. 
However, in cases of extreme short bowel, bowel lengthening 
by STEP has not been enough to escape from short bowel syndrome, and subsequent TPN and its complication would still 
be a major risk factor of survival. In such cases, the second STEP 
is a very helpful procedure. After animal studies of second STEP 
(7), several reports revealed and supported its advantages (4-6). 
This procedure offers not only the original advantages of technical ease and simplicity, but it also apparently has the benefit 
of additional intestinal length. The intestinal elongation produced by second STEP could be a critical length of intestine in 
treating short bowel syndrome. Our case also supports the utiliA B

ty of second STEP. In our study, the patient was able to survive 
without TPN after the first STEP, but her bowel length was not 
enough to escape from short bowel syndrome. Although natural growth of the small bowel would be helpful in managing 
short bowel syndrome, elongation of the small bowel length by 
the second STEP would be critical lengthening to rescue the 
patient from short bowel syndrome. 
While our second STEP was performed without major difficulties, several points of caution must be noted. First, application of the stapler should be safe from ischemic bowel changes. 
Deformed mesenteric blood supply and uneven dilatation of 
the bowel, which had happened after the first STEP in our case, 
are problematic to staple firing. The surgeon has to ensure that 
the blood supply between each staple line is not injured by the 
staples. Second, there are few options for placing the staple lines 
to make a uniform diameter of bowel and reduce the blind ends 
(4-7). We adopted a simple addition of staple line between previous staple lines without further modification. Because of limitations of previous studies, it is difficult to recommend the best 
method of making staple lines, but it should be tailored to individual cases. In addition to these concerns, unquestionably, abdominal exploration should be performed very carefully to avoid 
unexpected injury to the bowel.
Our case was successful in weaning the patient off the TPN 
and freeing her from intravenous fluid by the second STEP. However, the patient is still in a very low percentile in body weight 
and height. She also has vitamin D deficiency, which probably 
originated from the short length of her bowel. This indicates that 
nutritional evaluation and support should be an essential part 
of management, even when the second STEP is successful.
