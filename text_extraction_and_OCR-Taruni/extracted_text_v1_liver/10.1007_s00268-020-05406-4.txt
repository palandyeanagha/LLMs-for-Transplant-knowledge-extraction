Abstract
Background Donor variational arteries often require complex reconstruction.
Methods We analysed the incidence of different variations, types of arterial reconstructions and their impact on postoperative results from 409 patients undergoing liver transplantation at Karolinska Institute between 2007 and 2015.
Results A total of 292 (71.4%) liver grafts had a standard hepatic artery (SHA), and 117 (28.6%) showed hepatic
artery variants (HAV). 58% of HAV needed reconstruction. The main variations were variant left hepatic artery
(45.3%) from the gastric artery; variant right hepatic artery (38.5%); and a triple combination of variant right and left
hepatic artery and the proper hepatic artery from the common hepatic artery (12.8%); other 3.4%. Patients/graft
survival and arterial complications were not different between SHA and HAV. Incidence of biliary stricture was
numerically higher in left hepatic artery variants (p = 0.058) and in variants where no arterial reconstruction was
performed (p = 0.001). Operation and arterial warm ischaemia time were longer in the HAV group. The need for
intraoperative re-reconstruction was higher in the HAV group (p = 0.04). Intraoperative bleeding was larger after
back-table reconstruction than with intraoperative reconstruction (p = 0.04).
Conclusion No overall differences were found between the HAV and the SHA groups. Occurrence of a variant left
hepatic artery and HAV with no reconstruction seems to increase the risk of biliary strictures.

Introduction
The documented variation of hepatic artery in the population is between 31 and 49% [1]. There are several studies
that define the anatomic classification systems of hepatic
arteries, and Michel’s classification is used the most [2–6].
The presence of all hepatic arteries that are accessory or
as a replacement should be demonstrated during donor

liver operation or back-table work. However, that might
not always be possible to determine whether an artery is
replaced or accessory due to intrahepatic arterial branches
which are not dissected, and angiography is not performed
routinely. Once the hepatic artery variations have been
recognized, it is possible to assess the necessity of arterial
reconstruction to provide an optimal arterial blood supply
for the graft. Hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT) is a lifethreatening complication in liver transplantation and may
require retransplantation. HAT presents 3–9% of all
orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) [7]. The risk factors
for HAT have been identified; however, systematic analysis assessing the role of HAV and the type of reconstruction on the outcome is rare [1, 8, 9]. The quality of
reconstruction of those arteries is essential to prevent
arterial thrombosis, which in turn leads to biliary complications and graft loss [10–13].
The purpose of this study was to analyse the impact of
the HAV and the effect of hepatic artery reconstruction on
patients and grafts survival in full-sized adult OLT patients.
Additionally, we analysed its effect on primary graft
function, HAT and biliary complications.
Materials and methods
Analysis has been done from the data of all patients who
18 years of age or older, undergoing whole organ liver
transplantation at Karolinska University Hospital in
Stockholm between May 2007 and June 2015. Living
donor liver transplantation, domino transplantation, multiorgan transplantation, intraoperative death, portocaval
transposition and arterial interposition grafts, split and
reduced grafts were excluded from the study. Furthermore,
in cases of patients receiving a second liver graft within
3 years after the first transplantation, only the outcome of
the first transplantation was included in the study analysis.
Donor arterial anatomy was recorded as it was described
in operative notes from the donor operation and the
recipient transplantation procedures. At that time during
the study period, we did not perform routine radiological
examination before organ harvesting. However, today,
partially based on the result from this study we perform
routinely CT liver scan in every donor in part to recognize
arterial variations and to estimate liver graft volume. Cases
with extra arteries, accessory or replaced, were defined as a
hepatic artery variant (HAV); replaced or accessory right
hepatic artery (RHA) from superior mesenteric artery
(SMA) or elsewhere, Michel’s (M) type III and VI was
classified as variant RHA; accessory or replaced left hepatic artery (LHA) from left gastric artery (LGA) (M type II
and V), which was classified as variant (LHA); RHA from
SMA ? LHA from LGA ? common hepatic artery (CHA)
from truncus coeliacus (M type VII and type VIII), which
was classified as triple; both LHA from LGA and RHA
from SMA with absence of CHA, double replaced system
(M type IV), which was classified as other (Fig. 1).
Arterial anastomosis was performed using 6/0 or 7/0
running or interrupted vascular sutures Prolene with using
loupe glasses in magnifications raging from 2.2 to 3.2. The
reconstruction method and whether reconstruction was
done during back-table work or during the recipient operation and it was chosen by the recipient surgeon under
consideration of the anatomy of the graft and the anatomical arterial variation found in the recipient. The principle
was to reconstruct any of the variational arteries. In the
cases with appropriate artery, we used branch patch in both
donor and recipient artery to perform anastomosis. If patch
creation was not possible, end-to-end anastomosis was
performed with running or interrupted suture based on
diameter of the vessel. In the variant artery group, arterial
anastomosis was performed either with a trunk patch on the
graft side with one anastomosis (‘‘no-reconstruction’’
group) (Fig. 2a) or used donor or recipient branch patch for
extra anastomosis to reimplant variant arteries (‘‘reconstruction’’ group) (Fig. 2b, c). Portal and arterial blood
flow was measured intraoperatively after reperfusion with
ultrasonic flow measurement (Vingmed). The first protocol liver biopsy (zero biopsy) was taken after reperfusion
of the liver graft just before closure of the abdomen.
Routine Doppler ultrasound examination was performed on
the first post-operative day to evaluate portal or arterial
thrombosis. In the patients with questionable ultrasonographic findings and/or clinical suspicion of HAT or portal
thrombosis, computed tomography angiography was performed to verify diagnosis. If normal circulation was
shown in liver in the first USG examination, the next
examination was performed only if there were any clinical
indication, such as elevated liver blood tests. After the first
examination within the first 24 h after transplantation,
artery surveillance includes control Doppler ultrasound at
3-month and 1-year check-up.
Immunosupressive protocols were based on basiliximab
therapy followed by tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil
and prednisolone triple therapy. The standard thrombosis
prophlaxis was 500 ml of dextran daily intravenous infusion during the first five days after transplantation followed
by daily peroral 75 mg acetylsalicyl acid for a one year
after transplantation.
Donor variables were age, sex, BMI, serum liver functions and sodium, days of stay at intensive care unit (ICU),
cold ischaemia time (CIT) (from donor cold organ perfusion start time to recipient portal reperfusion time), arterial
warm ischaemia time (from portal reperfusion to the end of
the total hepatic arterial reperfusion) reason of the brain
dead and rate of liver steatosis in the zero biopsy. Recipient

variables tested were age, sex, BMI, indication of transplantation, MELD score, time of waiting list, warm
ischaemia time (WIT) (from liver in the abdomen and
portal reperfusion), days of stay at ICU, total days of
hospitalization and preoperative serum transaminases as
well as on post-operative days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 14 and 30.
Primary graft non-function defined as UNOS definition,
dead due to graft non-function and retransplantation in
10 days after transplantation, early allograft dysfunction
defined as followings: alanine transaminase (ALT) and/or
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) [2000 IU/l ([34 lkat/l)
within the first 7 days, bilirubin C10 mg/dl (C171 lmol)
on day 7 [14], acute rejection up to day 30 post-transplantation, and biliary and vascular complication (arterial
thrombosis, pseoudoaneurysm and portal thrombosis) were
also evaluated. Biliary complications were evaluated by
our local transplant registry, review of radiological
assessment and patient journals. Biliary complications
were divided as: non-anastomotic strictures and only
anastomotic strictures, followed by ERCP or PTC intervention at least once [15]. Biliary stricture occurred within
1 year of transplantation defined as early stricture and if
occurred after more than 1 year defined as late stricture.
Biliary leakage was diagnosed by cholangiography or bilious secretion and considered as a primary complication.
Patient death and graft loss were included in the analysis
regardless of etiology. The results were analysed in relation
to the presence of a standard hepatic artery, hepatic artery
variations, need for arterial reconstruction, arterial reconstruction on back table versus during recipient operation,
and the location of variant arterial anastomosis. The need

for perop arterial re-reconstruction after primary arterial
reperfusion was also analysed.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were used for donor/recipient
parameters. The data are presented as mean values ± standard deviations and median (minimum–maximum).
Patients and graft survival were evaluated with the Kaplan–
Meier analysis. To compare categorical variables, the Chisquare and Fisher’s exact analysis was used. Homogeneity
and normality of data were evaluated with the Kolmogorov–Smirnov analysis. The Mann–Whitney U test
was used to evaluate nonparametric variables. The student
t test was used to evaluate parametric variables. Continuous
variables among the groups were compared with the oneway analysis of variance (ANOVA). Multivariate logistic
regression analysis was used to analyse of the risk factor
assessment for biliary stricture. The analysis was carried
out with variable which found to be statistically significant
with student t test or Chi-square analysis and also on
variables which had potential clinical relevance, including
CIT, arterial WIT, total bleeding/transfusion, donor age
and HAT. The SPSS 21.0 statistical software (SPSS, Inc.,
Chicago, IL) was used to perform statistical analysis. The
results were considered to be significant if p value \0.05.
Results
Between May 2007 and June 2015, 546 orthotopic liver
transplantations were performed at our centre. According
to the exclusion criteria, 137 patients were excluded from
the study. 409 patients were included; 292 (71.4%) liver
grafts had standard hepatic artery (SHA) and 117 (28.6%)
presented a hepatic artery variant (HAV). Mean follow-up
was 42 ± 28 months (1–105 month) for SHA group and
47 ± 28 months (3–104 month) for HAV group
(p = 0.07). In the SHA group, donor mean age was
54.1 ± 15.8 years and 52.3 ± 17.6 years in the HAV
group (p = 055). Donor characteristics were similar
between the groups (data not shown). In the SHA group,
recipient mean age was 51.6 ± 12.3 and 49.1 ± 13.5 in
the HAV group (p = 0.09). Other recipient’s baseline
characteristics were not different between the groups (data
not shown).
The variations of graft hepatic artery were: variant LHA
(M type II and V); 53 donors, 12.9%; variant RHA (M type
III and VI, 45 donors, 11% (2 from GDA, 1 directly from
aorta, 42 from SMA); triple artery (M type VII and type
VIII) 15 donors, 3.7%; other variations (M type IV, 4
donors, 1%) (Fig. 1).
The artery used for graft main arterial reconstruction
was different between the SHA and HAV groups and
consisted of the following: in SHA, 7 (2.4%) using graft
celiac trunk, 150 (51.7%) using graft GDA, 24 (8.3%)
using graft CHA, 15 (5.2%) using graft hepatica propria, 86
(29.7%) using graft splenic artery, 8 (2.8%) using graft
aortic patch. In the HAV group: 27 (23.1%) using graft
celiac trunk, 12 (10.3%) using graft GDA, 15 (12.8%)
using graft CHA, 14 (12%) using graft hepatica propria, 29
(24.8%) using graft splenic artery, 16 (13.7%) using graft
aortic patch and 4 (3.4%) using graft SMA for main artery
reconstruction (p\ 0.001).
The intraoperative parameters are presented in Table 1.
Type of hepatic vein reconstruction, bile duct reconstruction and use of bile duct stent were not different between
the groups. The rate of perioperative artery re-reconstruction due to intraoperative arterial thrombosis, unsatisfied
artery flow or kinking was 5.5% in the SHA group and
12.8% in the HAV group (p = 0.01). Signs of ischaemia on
zero biopsy were not different between the two groups
(p = 0.09).
Pre-transplantation and post-transplantation blood
chemistry tests and post-transplantation liver enzymes
were not different between the both groups (data not
shown). Incidence of post-operative complications such as
biliary complications, primary non-function, re-operation
due to bleeding, allograft dysfunction and portal thrombosis was not different between the SHA and HAV groups.
The total post-transplant arterial thrombosis rate was 0.7%.
Arterial complications occurred in 3 (1%) patients
(thrombosis in one patient, arterial pseudoaneurysm in two
patients) in the simple artery group and in 4 (3.4%) patients
(2 patients with thrombosis, and 2 with arterial pseudoaneurysm) in the variant artery group (p = 0.09). All the
patients with pseudoaneurysm died due to septic complications after coiling (diffuse biliary strictures, duodenum
and pancreas necrosis, intrahepatic abscesses) within
3–15 months after transplantation. Of the three patients
with arterial thrombosis, one was retransplanted due to
biliary complications and one underwent thrombectomy
with revision of artery anastomosis and survived with good
graft function and open artery. A liver abscess occurred in
the third patient and was drained percutaneously. This
patient died three months after transplantation due to pulmonary embolism.
The overall and 1, 12, 60 month graft survival rates
were 79% and 97%, 92%, 76% in the SHA group and 86%
and 99%, 95%, 84% in the HAV group, respectively
(p = 0.07) (Fig. 3). The overall and 1, 12, 60 month patient
survival rates were 82% and 98%, 92%, 79% in the SHA
group, 86% and 100%, 96%, 85% in the variant group,
respectively (p = 0.18) (Fig. 4).

Comparison of subgroups regarding arterial
variants and the results of different arterial
reconstructions
Comparisons of different variation of arteries are shown in
Table 2. Biliary strictures showed a tendency to occur
more frequently in livers with variant LHA (M type II/V)
group than the other groups (p = 0.058). When comparing
the two most common arterial variations (M type II/V to
the M type III/VI), biliary strictures were more common in
patients with variation M type II/V (p = 0.01). Posttransplantation liver blood tests were not different between
the subgroups (data not shown).
In 42 liver grafts (35.9%) with HAV, no reconstruction
was performed because the arterial supply was ensured by
a common trunk [M type II and V in 37 donors (88.1%), M
type III and VI in 4 donors (9.5%), and M type VII and
VIII in 1 donor (2.4%)]. A total of 68 (58.1%) HAV which
required additional arterial anastomosis reconstruction
performed on back table or intraoperatively: M type III and
VI in 40 donors (58.8%); M type IV in 4 donors (5.9%); M
type VII and VIII in 14 donors (20.6%); M type II and V in
10 donors (14.7%), (p\0.001). Biliary strictures, both,

anaostomotic and non-anastomotic were more common in
variant cases without arterial reconstruction than in cases in
which reconstruction was performed (p = 0.001). This
difference was confirmed by logistic regression multivariate analysis that showed the absence of reconstruction was
an independent risk factor for biliary stricture (p = 0.002,
OR = 8.3, 95% CI: 2.1–32.4). Additionally, donor age,
leakage, total bleeding and total blood transfusion under
operation were the other independent risk factor for biliary
stricture.
In the LHA variant group, reconstruction was performed
in 10 out of 53 (18.9%) patients. No patient in LHA
variants group with reconstruction developed biliary strictures. However, in 10 (27%) patients without such reconstruction, biliary strictures of clinical significance occurred
(p = 0.09).
A total of 6 patients with LHA variants and 1 RHA
variant could not be repaired due to too small diameter of
the artery or it was severely injured during the donor
procurement (4 cases with irreversible damage from donor
operation, and 3 cases with technical failure mainly due to
too small vessel diameter). Biliary strictures occurred in 2
of 6 patients with ligated LHA variants and were not different when compared with no-reconstructed LHA variants
[2 (33%) vs. 10 (27%) p = 0.7]. Additionally, biliary
stricture was not different in reconstructed LHA variants
when compared with ligated LHA variants [0 (0%) vs. 2
(33%) p = 0.12].
The arteries used for arterial reconstruction consisted of
the following: 26 (38.8%) RHA to graft GDA; 10 (14.9%)
RHA anastomosed to graft splenic artery; 11 (16.4%) RHA
to the recipient’s GDA or right hepatic artery, 3 (4.5%)
RHA to graft celiac trunk, 7 (10.4%) LHA to graft GDA, 1
(1.5%) LHA to graft splenic artery, 4 (6%) LHA to the
recipient’s GDA or left hepatic artery, in two patients
(3.0%) combined RHA to graft GDA and LHA to splenic
artery. In 3 (4.5%) patients, arterial anastomosis was performed either as a side-to-side to the graft main artery or to
a small branch on the graft main artery. Intraoperative total
bleeding, total blood transfusions and cold ischaemia time
were bigger and longer in patients after arterial reconstruction (Table 3).
Impact of the back-table versus intraoperative
reconstruction
A total of 68 (58.1%) HAV required back-table or intraoperative additional arterial anastomosis reconstruction.
Twenty were reconstructed at back table and 47 intraoperatively after portal reperfusion. In one patient, there is no
clear information regarding timing of artery reconstruction.
In all intraoperative reconstruction cases, reconstruction of
an additional artery was performed after portal reperfusion
and partial arterial reperfusion after reperfusion of the liver
graft via the main artery (Table 4). Similar types of variants were seen in the two groups. Rate of preoperative
artery re-reconstruction due to unsatisfied artery flow,
thrombosis or kinking was higher in the intraoperative
reconstruction group (p = 0.05). Intraoperative total
bleeding was much more in the back-table reconstruction
group (p = 0.04). Arterial WIT was longer in the intraoperative reconstruction group (p = 0.004). Overall graft/patient survival and biliary complication was similar between
the two groups.
Impact of the site of arterial reconstruction,
recipient or donor side
In 68 HAV, which required arterial reconstruction, 15
reconstructions were performed with the recipient’s arteries and the remaining 52 using graft arteries. In one patient,
there was no information regarding the position of reconstruction. Similar types of variants were seen in the two
groups. Arterial WIT, CIT, operation time, blood flow,
bleeding the necessity of perop re-reconstruction, arterial
complication, biliary complications and patient/graft survival were not different between groups (data not shown).
Is a graft artery with gastroduodenal artery (GDA)
patch for anastomosis superior to other alternatives
in patients with standard hepatic artery?
A graft artery with GDA patch was used in 150 patients. In
141 transplantations, other alternatives were used. There
were no differences between two groups in term of recipient and donor demographic characteristics except for
lower donor BMI in the GDA patch group (p = 0.025). In
the GDA group, operation time was shorter (p = 0.003).
There were no arterial flow differences between the groups,
but portal flow was higher in the non-GDA group
(p = 0.027). A higher post-operative bilirubin level on days
3–7 was seen in the non-GDA group (p = 0.02). There
were no differences in term of graft/patient survival and
biliary complications (Table 5).
Discussion
Hepatic arterial complications such as thrombosis after
liver transplantation have a significant effect on mortality
and morbidity [16]. It has previously been reported that
donor anatomical variations of hepatic artery, which needs
complex arterial reconstruction, might be associated with a
higher incidence of arterial complications [17]. However,
some studies have also pointed out that arterial variations
do not affect the arterial or biliary complications [18].
World J Surg (2020) 44:1954–1965 1961
123

Previous studies have also showed that liver function was
not effected by arterial reconstruction [1, 10, 19]. In our
series, incidence of HAV was found in 28.6% liver grafts.
However, there were a longer arterial warm ischaemia time
and higher rate of preoperative arterial re-reconstruction in
the variant group. There were no overall differences
between the variant and the standard artery groups
regarding biliary and arterial complication or graft and
patient survival. Interestingly, the occurrence of biliary
strictures was significantly associated with presence of
variant LHA. This may indicate the importance of reconstruction of a left hepatic artery variant to prevent biliary
strictures. Furthermore, this is also underscored by the
reduced incidence of biliary strictures in the reconstructed
cases in comparison with the cases where reconstructions
were judged not to be necessary.

During harvesting of organs, it is important to correctly
identify the graft arterial anatomy to avoid damage and to
do reconstruction planning. Soliman et al. analysed patients
with hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT) after complex arterial reconstruction [17]. In their study, the presence of a left
accessory artery resulted in 12% incidence of HAT compared with 7.4% with a right accessory artery. However,
this difference was not statistically significant (p\ 0.1). In
the presented study, HAT was not different between the
variant and standard artery group and total HAT incidence
was low (0.7%). This could be probably due to our postoperative intensive thrombosprophylaxis procedure which
can reduce the incidence of HAT [20].
Back-table reconstruction may prolong the backtable work, but the CIT is not inevitable prolonged [13]. In
our study, CIT was not different between back table and
intraoperative reconstruction groups. However, arterial
warm ischaemia time was prolonged when variational
artery reconstruction was performed during recipient
operation. Artery reconstruction during back table correlates with more bleeding during the operation but lower
incidence of re-reconstruction after arterial reperfusion.
This did not seem to have any negative effect on outcome.
Pe´rez-Saborido et al. [1] showed that the presence of a
graft RHA variant and the need for reconstruction was
associated with longer CIT and shorter overall survival.
The findings of our study did not indicate any differences
between arterial variations regarding cold ischaemia time,
patient and graft survival. However, we observed that biliary strictures were more common in liver with LHA
variation (including 10 reconstruction on LHA and 37
reconstructions on trunk level). Incidence of biliary stricture was higher in such variant cases when no arterial
reconstruction was performed because the arterial supply
was ensured for both main and variant LHA by a common
trunk. Absence of reconstruction was shown as an independent risk factor with regression analysis as well. Variants of LHA were less often reconstructed with an extra
anastomosis when compared to other variants. The need for
this may be underestimated by the possibility of having a
common trunk. Reconstruction of variant LGA with an
extra anastomosis with graft or recipient branch artery,
such as GD, might improve the arterial supply rather than
leaving a long graft artery using a common trunk for
anastomosis to supply blood for both main and variant
artery. Reconstruction of a variant LGA rather than leaving
a long graft artery using a common trunk should be considered. Preservation of the aberrant LHA during liver
transplantation is recommended; however, it may also be a
risk factor for HAT if long graft artery is used to do only
one anastomosis. Herrero et al. [21] presented in their study
that the use of a long graft artery to create arterial reconstruction is an independent risk factor for early HAT.
Montalti et al. showed in their prospective study that the
incidence of non-anastomotic biliary strictures was significantly higher in cases where accessory LHA non-ligated
than in the ligated group. They conclude that an aberrant
LHA if demonstrated as an accessory can be safely ligated
[22].
Localization of the graft to recipient arterial anastomosis
is dependent on the both donor and recipient individual
anatomy but also on the preference of the surgeon. A
typical anastomosis in grafts with standard anatomy is
between a graft GDA patch and the corresponding place in
the recipient by an opening in the proper and common
hepatic artery using a wide patch to side anastomosis with
running sutures [23]. We compared this typical anastomosis to all other variants in standard anatomy cases and
found no differences in arterial complications, graft survival or arterial flow. However, portal flow after

reperfusion and post-operative first month bilirubin level
was higher in the non-GDA group.
In some HAV cases, it might not be possible to use the
graft artery to perform a reconstruction. In these cases,
recipient right/left hepatic artery, recipient gastroduodenal
artery or recipient accessory artery might be used for
reconstruction. In our study, it did not affect patients/graft
survival and the occurrence of complications.
The presented study has limitations: This is a retrospective study with relatively few patients with variant
arteries. Variant arteries could not be investigated as if
accessory or replaced because we did not perform routine
radiological examination before organ harvesting in the
time of study period and we did not investigate with
ultrasound examination to show if there was a back flow in
any of the reconstructed artery.
In conclusion, in our material, 28.6% of donor grafts
presented an arterial variant. In 58% of them, reconstructions involving at least two arterial anastomoses were
needed. Total incidence of HAT was 0.7%. Reconstruction
seems to compensate for longer arterial warm ischaemia
time and the higher preoperative artery re-reconstruction
rate that occur when a variant hepatic artery is present.
Reconstruction of variant LGA with an extra anastomosis
with graft or recipient branch artery, such as GD, seems to
be beneficial rather than leaving a long graft artery using a
common trunk for anastomosis to supply blood for both
main and variant artery. Graft/patient survival rates were
not inferior in patients receiving HAV graft.
