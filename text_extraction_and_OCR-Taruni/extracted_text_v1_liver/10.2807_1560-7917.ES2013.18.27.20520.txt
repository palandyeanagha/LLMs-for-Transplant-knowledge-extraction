The Nordic countries faced a food-borne outbreak 
of hepatitis A that started in October 2012 and was 
ongoing with 103 reported cases as of 27 June 2013. A 
case–control study in Denmark, Finland, Norway and 
Sweden, combined with trace-back investigations, 
has identified frozen strawberries as the likely cause 
of the outbreak. The origin of the berries is still being 
investigated.
Hepatitis A seroprevalence is under 10% in Nordic 
countries [1] where endemicity is very low [2]. In 
February 2013, Denmark noticed an increase in the 
number of notified hepatitis A virus (HAV) infections 
among individuals with no travel history. On 1 March 
2013, following an urgent enquiry posted through the 
European Epidemic Intelligence Information System for 
food- and waterborne diseases (EPIS-FWD), Finland, 
Norway and Sweden reported a similar increase and 
identified cases that were infected with the same IB 
genotype and sequence (KC876797) as the Danish 
cases, as well as cases with closely related sequences 
[3]. In March 2013, a case–control study conducted in 
Denmark identified frozen berries, particularly frozen 
strawberries, as the likely vehicle of the outbreak, but 
could not exclude other frozen berries [3]. As a result 
of this finding, the four Nordic countries recommended 
boiling all frozen berries before consumption [3]. 
While public health institutes in the four country 
coordinated their data collection methods to pool the 
analysis of the country-specific case–control studies 
to identify the vehicle of the outbreak more precisely, 
investigators compared the outbreak strains with the 
HAV network (HAVNET) database [4] to gain information on the probable phylogenetic origin of the outbreak strains, and food agencies analysed product 
distribution and tested fruit specimens.
Methods
Case definitions 
A probable case was defined as a person living in 
Denmark, Finland, Norway or Sweden who developed 
clinical illness compatible with HAV infection on or 
after* 1 October 2012 (1 December 2012 for Sweden) 
and was positive for IgM antibodies against HAV. 
We excluded cases who (i) reported travel outside of 
Western European countries two to six weeks before 
onset of symptoms, (ii) were living in the same household as a patient with HAV infection typed with a genotype or sequence not belonging to the outbreak and 
(iii) reported other risk factors for hepatitis A exposure 
including injection drug use, homelessness or male-tomale sexual contact (the exposures under (iii) were not 
ascertained in Swedish and Finnish cases). 
A confirmed case was defined as a probable case 
infected with HAV genotype 1B with the sequence identified by GenBank number KC876797 (hereafter called 
sequence 1) or a sequence that differed by no more 
than 2% from sequence KC876797 [3], and was isolated 
in at least two of the four affected countries.
A secondary case was defined as a probable or confirmed case with symptom onset two to six weeks after 
close contact with a primary probable or confirmed 
case. 
Descriptive epidemiology
We described the distribution of cases by age, sex, 
country of residence, disease status (confirmed, probable, secondary) and HAV sequence. 
Case–control studies
Each country conducted a matched case–control study 
based on the Danish case–control study protocol, 
modified according to findings from their own trawling 
questionnaires. Early and regular communication by 
email and teleconferences, as well as sharing of study 
plans and questionnaires, ensured that data could be 
used for joint analysis.
Control selection and invitation
Each country randomly selected controls using national 
population registries, matched on age, sex and place 
of residence (municipality in Denmark, Norway and 

2 www.eurosurveillance.org
Finland; county in Sweden). Controls were excluded if 
they were vaccinated against HAV, reported a previous 
HAV infection, or if they had been travelling for more 
than two weeks in western Europe or any length of 
time outside of western Europe in the six weeks prior 
to recruitment.
Data collection
In Denmark, investigators telephoned potential controls until two controls per case had been recruited. 
In Norway, the same procedure was followed for two 
to three controls per case. Sweden invited six controls 
per case by post and Finland invited 30 controls per 
case, by phone. The latter two countries included all 
controls who accepted the invitation.
Cases and controls were asked about the consumption 
of a range of food items, including berries, during the 
six weeks before onset of illness (cases) or recruitment 
(controls). Norway asked controls about exposures 
during the period corresponding to the exposure period 
of the cases (January to February 2013).
Data analysis 
The pooled analysis regrouped primary confirmed 
cases included in the national studies with at least 
one matched control (Denmark, Norway, Sweden) or 
before 24 May (Finland). The strength of the association between HAV infection and consumption of food 
items present in at least three country questionnaires 
was estimated using matched odds ratio (mOR) and 
95% confidence intervals (CI) using conditional logistic regression. Statistically significant exposures at 
the alpha=0.05 level were fitted in a multivariable 
conditional logistic regression model to adjust for confounding. We stratified the analysis by HAV sequence 
isolated in cases [3] and compared cases with HAV 
sequence 1 and cases with HAV sequence 2 in terms of 
consumption of berries using Fisher’s exact test.

The Swedish case–control study (including confirmed 
cases only) was also analysed individually. As controls 
could not be recruited for every case, the match was 
broken (after checking that matched and unmatched 
ORs were of the same magnitude) and odds ratios (OR) 
with 95% CI were calculated using logistic regression, 
adjusting for age.
Identification of strain origin
Laboratory confirmation of the cases has been 
described previously [3]. To look for indications of the 
geographical origin of the outbreak strains, we analysed the phylogeny using the HAVNET database that 
contains sequence data of viruses from patients from 
non-endemic countries, many of whom contracted 
the infection in a foreign country (67% of sequences 
in HAVNET are from isolates from Dutch patients). A 
total of 442 nucleotides in the VP1-P2A region and 466 
nucleotides in the VP1 region of the genome were analysed separately. The probable origin of the cluster of 
sequences including the outbreak strains was ascertained as previously described [5]. 
Product distribution analysis 
In Norway and Denmark sales receipts obtained 
from the cases were used to ascertain the types and 
brands of berries purchased before symptom onset. 
Supermarkets chains assisted in tracing suppliers and 
countries of origin of the berries. 
Danish, Finnish, Norwegian and Swedish, national 
food authorities collected soft fruit specimens (berries 
and mango) from confirmed cases’ freezers and from 
shops selling suspected batches. Denmark, Norway 
and Sweden analysed the specimens applying the 
same standardised HAV detection method [6] based 
on reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-PCR). In addition, Denmark and Norway followed 
a protocol specifically developed for soft fruits [7]. 
Specimens from Finland were tested in Denmark.
Results
As of 27 June 2013, 103 cases (59 confirmed, 34 probable and 10 secondary) were reported, 66 in Denmark, 
17 in Sweden, 13 in Finland and seven in Norway (Figure 
1). The age range was 4–76 years (median: 24 years) 
and 61% were female. No cases with the outbreak 
sequences were excluded because of other hepatitis 
A risk factors. The most recent case (as of June 27) 
was reported in Norway (illness onset 14 June 2013). 
Sequence 1) was isolated from 42 of 59 confirmed 
cases, whereas a second sequence with 1.7% difference to sequence 1 over 847 bp (GenBank accession 
number KC876799, hereafter called sequence 2) was 
isolated from 17 of 59 cases. 
Case–control studies
After excluding cases that did not have a matched control, the multicountry analysis included 26 confirmed 
cases (Denmark: 12, Sweden: 6, Norway: 4, Finland:

4) and 56 controls, with one to five controls per case. 
In the univariable analysis, eating frozen strawberries 
(mOR 8.8; 95% CI 2.5–30), frozen raspberries (mOR 7.3; 
95% CI 2.1–26), berry-containing smoothies (mOR 8.3; 
95% CI 1.8–38) and frozen mixed berries (mOR 11; 95% 
CI 1.3–86, Table) was associated with being a case. 
Of the 26 confirmed cases, 22 reported eating frozen 
strawberries, 16 reported eating frozen raspberries, 
and eight reported eating frozen mixed berries. When 
including strawberries, raspberries and mixed berries 
in a multivariable model, only strawberries remained 
significantly associated with being a confirmed case 
(mOR 11.4; 95% CI 1.9–70, Table). When restricting the 
analysis to cases with sequence 1, eating strawberries 
and raspberries were both associated with HAV infection (crude mOR 6.1; 95% CI 1.7–22 and mOR 5.6; 95% 
CI 1.1–27, respectively). However, only eating strawberries was associated with being a confirmed case 
in multivariable analysis (mOR 5.8; 95% CI 1.2–27 
for strawberries, mOR 5.3; 95% CI 0.77–36 for raspberries). When restricting the analysis to cases with 
sequence 2, eating frozen raspberries was also associated with being a confirmed case (crude mOR 11; 95% 
CI 1.3–92). Since all sequence 2 cases consumed frozen strawberries, an mOR for frozen strawberries could 
not be calculated, but the association was statistically 
significant. Cases with sequence 1 were as likely to 
have eaten strawberries and raspberries as cases with 
sequence 2 (Fisher’s exact test: p=0.54 and p=0.35, 
respectively).
The Swedish case–control study included eight confirmed cases and 18 controls. Frozen strawberries 
were the only exposure significantly associated with 
HAV infection (crude OR: 24; 95% CI 1.9–1,200) (Table), 
which remained significant after adjusting for age (OR: 
82; 95% CI 1.7–3,929). 
Identification of strain origin
The most frequently represented countries of infection 
included in HAVNET were Egypt (n=30), Morocco (n=21) 
and Turkey (n=15). All samples were from travellers. A 
comparison of the two investigated genomic regions 
indicated that the outbreak strains were associated 
with strains commonly isolated in travellers infected in 
Egypt (p<0.001, Figure 2). Sequence 1 and 2 differed by 
1.22% over 1,233 bp and by 1.26 % over 397 bp, respectively, from the strain causing a concurrent outbreak in 
travellers returning from Egypt [4].
Product investigation analysis
As of 27 June, 54 soft fruit specimens (17 from Denmark, 
14 from Finland, 11 from Sweden, 12 from Norway) were 
tested, 23 of which were strawberries. HAV was not 
detected in any of the specimens. 
Trace-back analysis was ongoing as of 27 June 2013, 
pointing at strawberries from several countries. 
Public health actions
On 22 May 2013 Public Health and Food agencies 
in Denmark, Finland and Norway issued statements 
identifying strawberries as the likely vehicle of the 
outbreak, but maintained previous recommendations 
to boil all frozen berries before consumption due to 
the potential implication of other berries. Sweden 
restricted the boiling notice to strawberries only. On 30 
May 2013, one supermarket chain in Denmark, Norway 
and Sweden voluntarily recalled frozen strawberries 
from Egypt and Morocco packed in Belgium [8,9].

Discussion
After pooling data from the four affected countries, 
consumption of frozen strawberries, frozen raspberries and mixed frozen berries (which can contain both 
strawberries and raspberries) were significantly associated with being a confirmed case. Although the pooled 
analysis was restricted to earlier confirmed cases, this 
is unlikely to have introduced bias since there was no 
reason to believe later cases were different from earlier ones. Hepatitis A outbreaks have been previously 
linked to both strawberries [10,11] and raspberries 
[12,13], and frozen mixed berries are suspected in two 
hepatitis A outbreaks that were ongoing as of 27 June 
2013 in Italy and the United States (US) [14,15]. Frozen 
strawberries were most strongly associated with being 
a confirmed case and were the product most commonly eaten by cases. Additional elements pointed to 
the strawberries as the vehicle of the outbreak: Firstly, 
strawberries were most strongly associated with being 
a case in the Swedish national case–control study 
as well as national case–control studies in Denmark 
and Norway [3]. Secondly, strawberries were the only 
exposure significantly associated with being a confirmed case in the multicountry multivariable analysis. 
Thirdly, the preliminary food trace-back investigations 
pointed towards strawberries. Finally, when restricting 
the analysis to individuals who did not consume raspberries, the association between being a confirmed 
case and frozen strawberries remained significant. 
The strength of association between raspberries and 
being a confirmed case in the multicountry analysis 
was weaker than for strawberries. In addition, raspberries were not associated with illness in the Swedish 
study. Restricting the analysis to people who had not 
eaten strawberries was difficult because only four 
cases did not eat strawberries. Trace-back analysis 
found no evidence to implicate raspberries, but based 
on the epidemiological analyses, we cannot completely 
exclude that raspberries or frozen mixed berries may 
have played a role in the outbreak. 
The outbreak included two distinct (less than 2% different) HAV sequences that were found in the four 
countries during the outbreak period. There was no 
evidence that one outbreak strain was more strongly 
associated with one vehicle than the other. The HAV 
mutation rate is low [16], suggesting the two sequences 
identified in the outbreak represented distinct strains 
rather than a sporadic mutation. Such multi-strain 
food-borne hepatitis A outbreaks have been reported 
previously [17,18]. At this stage we do not know where 
in the production chain or in which country the contamination occurred. While the comparison of strains 
in the HAVNET database indicated an association with 
strains from travellers infected in Egypt, we cannot 
exclude that these strains also circulate in other countries. As HAV is not genotyped routinely, the known 
genetic diversity is biased towards more densely sampled regions. Finally, the trace-back investigation has 
not yet pointed to a single country. The origin of the 
contaminated strawberries or the point of contamination can therefore not be identified at this moment.
This outbreak occurred in the context of several hepatitis A outbreaks affecting Europe and EU residents 
[4,14,19] as well as another genotype 1B outbreak in 
the US related to frozen mixed berries [15]. The US and 
Nordic HAV strains are both genotype 1B and originate 
from the same geographic region but there is no evidence so far they are related [15].
HAV has as yet not been detected in the tested berries. Possible reasons could be that the HAV concentration in the samples collected may have been below 
the detection limit, or that other berries from the same 
batch contained HAV.
In conclusion, during this outbreak, combined evidence from case–control studies and the food traceback contributed to implicate frozen strawberries as 
the source of the outbreak, leading one supermarket 
chain voluntary recall this product. Investigations of 
the source will continue in order to identify the producer and batch and to test berries in the laboratory. 
In view of the long incubation period of hepatitis A [20] 
and of notification delay, more cases can be expected 
to occur for at least another few months, and possibly 
even later, despite interventions, as frozen berries can 
be stored in freezers for up to two years.
