The liver is to date the best example of a sexually dimorphic non-reproductive organ.
Over 1,000 genes are differentially expressed between sexes indicating that female
and male livers are two metabolically distinct organs. The spectrum of liver diseases is
broad and is usually prevalent in one or the other sex, with different contributing genetic
and environmental factors. It is thus difficult to predict individual’s disease outcomes
and treatment options. Systems approaches including mathematical modeling can aid
importantly in understanding the multifactorial liver disease etiology leading toward
tailored diagnostics, prognostics and therapy. The currently established computational
models of hepatic metabolism that have proven to be essential for understanding of
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are limited
to the description of gender-independent response or reflect solely the response of the
males. Herein we present LiverSex, the first sex-based multi-tissue and multi-level liver
metabolic computational model. The model was constructed based on in silico liver
model SteatoNet and the object-oriented modeling. The crucial factor in adaptation
of liver metabolism to the sex is the inclusion of estrogen and androgen receptor
responses to respective hormones and the link to sex-differences in growth hormone
release. The model was extensively validated on literature data and experimental data
obtained from wild type C57BL/6 mice fed with regular chow and western diet.
These experimental results show extensive sex-dependent changes and could not be
reproduced in silico with the uniform model SteatoNet. LiverSex represents the first
large-scale liver metabolic model, which allows a detailed insight into the sex-dependent
complex liver pathologies, and how the genetic and environmental factors interact with
the sex in disease appearance and progression. We used the model to identify the most
important sex-dependent metabolic pathways, which are involved in accumulation of
triglycerides representing initial steps of NAFLD. We identified PGC1A, PPARα, FXR, and
LXR as regulatory factors that could become important in sex-dependent personalized
treatment of NAFLD.

INTRODUCTION
The pharmacological and clinical discussions about the influence
of gender on drug metabolism and disease susceptibility are
raising, while on the other hand studies that would reveal
the molecular basis of sex-based differences in humans are
limited (Flórez-Vargas et al., 2016). Sexual dimorphism in animal
kingdom has been known for centuries. Despite this, the majority
of studies still focus on one sex and the results are discussed
in a generalized manner. The choice of males as the dominant
research model was justified by studies that showed females
having higher biological variability associated with fluctuation of
sex hormones during the reproductive cycle (McGregor et al.,
2016).
Sexual dimorphism is a widespread phenomenon of somatic,
physiologic, and behavioral differences between females and
males (Söder, 2007; Urlep et al., 2017). Genes regulated by sex
hormones differ in their tissue expression, which is particularly
true for liver metabolism (Gustafsson et al., 1983). Transcriptome
and proteome studies report that scope of described sexually
dimorphic gene expression is significantly larger than previously
recognized. Thousands of genes differ in expression between
females and males not only in the liver (Laz et al., 2004; Yang
et al., 2006; Waxman and Holloway, 2009) but also in adipose
tissue and muscle, while brain expression seems to be less
sexually dimorphic (Yang et al., 2006). In the context of the
liver pathologies dissimilarities of sex hormones are listed among
the main reasons for the differences in the prevalence of liver
diseases. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is more frequent in
males (Zheng et al., 2017), while females have increased risk
of autoimmune liver diseases and exacerbated liver damage in
alcoholic liver disease (Guy and Peters, 2013). In non-alcoholic
fatty liver disease (NAFLD) the distinction is less clear with
inconsistent reports of increased incidence in males and postmenopausal women, possibly due to increased tendency for
visceral fat accumulation (Suzuki and Abdelmalek, 2009; Pan and
Fallon, 2014).
A recent comprehensive review of NAFLD studies (Ballestri
et al., 2017) identified age, sex, body construction, susceptibility
to gaining weight, existence of metabolic syndrome and
genetically determined characteristics as critical factors
influencing NAFLD onset and/or progression. Studies show
that the progression of NAFLD in males is independent of age
(Kojima et al., 2003; Xu et al., 2013). This is in contrast to the
correlation between age and NAFLD incidence in females, where
NAFLD occurrence is decreased in premenopausal, but not in
postmenopausal women (Hamaguchi et al., 2012; Florentino
et al., 2013). Another study reported that women with NAFLD
are approximately 10 years older than men (Carulli et al., 2006).
Based on these studies, premenopausal women might be better
protected from developing NAFLD compared to men and
postmenopausal women. Estrogens might provide part of the
explanation, as it has been reported that women with NAFLD
have lower concentrations of serum estradiol than woman
without NAFLD (Gutierrez-Grobe et al., 2010).
To describe the complex nature of liver metabolism and
predict all possible consequences of genetic and metabolic
insults computational approaches are applied (Petta et al.,
2016; Hoehme et al., 2017; Lorente et al., 2017). Several largescale metabolic models have been established to investigate
liver metabolism (Holzhütter et al., 2012; Drasdo et al., 2014)
and liver related diseases, such as NAFLD (Mardinoglu et al.,
2014; Naik et al., 2014) and HCC (Agren et al., 2014). Largescale metabolic models of liver metabolism and their clinical
applications have recently been reviewed (Cvitanovic et al., ´
2017). Among the most popular state-of-the-art computational
approaches are genome-scale metabolic networks, where omics
data are integrated to better understand the genotype-phenotype
relationships (Lewis et al., 2012). Large-scale metabolic models,
however, do not differentiate between genders and are mostly
established and validated on the unified or male data. Genderbased differentiation has been performed only in smaller models,
which do not account for the whole liver metabolism. Matthews
et al. (2007) constructed a database and a model to predict
reproductive toxicity in both genders, fetal dysmorphogenesis,
functional toxicity, mortality, growth, and new-born behavioral
toxicity of untested chemicals. A computational model of
oxygenation and transport of solutes in the kidneys of
spontaneously hypertensive female rats was used to investigate
the sex differences in nitric oxide levels (Chen et al., 2017). Agren
et al. (2014) established a liver metabolic model that indirectly
accounted for gender-related differences. They reconstructed a
personalized genome-scale metabolic model for each of the 27
patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Ten of the 27 patients
were females, which shows that personalized approaches can and
should take gender into account. The major reason for the lack
of human gender-based large-scale metabolic models might be
an insufficient number of liver transcriptome-based studies that
would account for both sexes (Zhang et al., 2012; Oshida et al.,
2016).
Herein we present LiverSex, the first gender based multi-tissue
and multi-level liver metabolic model. The construction of the
model was performed with the extension and adaptation of the
SteatoNet model (Naik et al., 2014), which was generated to
investigate hepatic metabolism and liver related deregulations.
SteatoNet as well as LiverSex feature two crucial characteristics:
they account for (1) interactions between hepatic metabolic
pathways and extra-hepatic tissues, and (2) regulations on
transcriptional and post-translational levels. The experimentally
observed sexual differences in liver gene expression were
successfully reproduced in silico with LiverSex. Finally, the
sensitivity analysis was applied to identify sex-dependent liver
metabolic network deregulations that transform healthy liver to
NAFLD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
SteatoNet and Object Oriented Modeling
SteatoNet (Steatosis Network) (Naik et al., 2014) represents
a dynamic semi-quantitative model based on a steady-state
analysis of differential algebraic equations (DAEs). SteatoNet
was established in object-oriented modeling language Modelica.
It is based on the Systems Biology library SysBio (Belic et al., ˇ
2013), which was constructed to describe biological pathway

entities. The SysBio library includes objects corresponding to
the biological behavior of enzymes, metabolites, non-enzymatic
regulatory proteins, mRNAs, flux sources, gene expression
regulations, etc. Using object-oriented modeling approach
models are easy to construct by linking the basic objects of
SysBio library into a meaningful and hierarchical composition.
Due to the steady-state normalization of the observed quantities
most of the parameters describing the dynamics of the observed
system are lumped when using SysBio library. This simplifies the
model establishment, since only a small set of parameters needs
to be evaluated. The main parameters governing the dynamical
properties of the established models describe the metabolic
flux distributions in each of the pathway branches. SteatoNet
includes all major pathways of mammalian liver metabolism.
Pathways that are included in the model were manually acquired
from KEGG (Du et al., 2014) and REACTOME (Croft et al.,
2011) databases and from the literature. SteatoNet additionally
describes the transport of metabolites between liver, adipose
tissue, pancreas, other extra-hepatic tissues, and macrophages
via blood. The external sources of nutrients [influx of fatty acids
and triglycerides (TG), glucose, cholesterol, and essential amino
acids] have also been included into the model. Details of its
structure have been extensively described before (Naik et al.,
2014).

Modelica simulation environment OpenModelica, which can be

Construction of LiverSex
The hormonal regulation is simplified to a level that still ensures
normal function. All included hormones are arranged into three
groups: growth hormone, androgen, and estrogens. Androgen or
estrogen groups represent any steroid hormones that regulate
the development and maintenance of sex characteristics in
vertebrates by binding to corresponding steroid hormone
receptor (Sharma et al., 2017). Each group of hormones has
its own source of flux. These sources display differences in
hormonal regulation of liver between females and males. The
growth hormone source acts as a daily oscillator in males or
has a constant concentration in females (Norstedt and Palmiter,
1984; Waxman and O’connor, 2006). The female estradiol source
mimics the monthly estrous cycle that cannot be found in males
(Ciana et al., 2003; Shanle and Xu, 2010; Villa et al., 2012). In
males, the androgen source is 10-fold higher than the estrogens
source (Domonkos et al., 2017), while in females the androgen
source is three-fold lower than the estrogen source (Simpson,
2003). Every hormone source is connected to its respective
receptor. Each hormone receptor has an active and inactive
form, which allows us to simulate different diseases connected
with the perturbations of receptor functions. Active form of the
receptors is in addition linked to SteatoNet according to the
literature evidence (Heine et al., 2000; Barclay et al., 2011; Gårevik
et al., 2012) and these connections than finally lead to the female
and male LiverSex model. A more detailed description of sexdependent hormonal regulation of liver metabolism is included
in the Supplementary Data.
Validation of LiverSex
Expression profiling data (GEO database GSE78892) obtained
from the hepatocyte specific Cyp51 knockout mice (Cyp51flox/flox;
Alb-Cre) (Lorbek et al., 2013, 2015) are used for direct LiverSex
validation. Female and male mice of mixed genetic background
(129/Pas × C57BL/6J, close to 90% C57BL/6J) were included in
the experiment and after the weaning period (age 3 weeks) put
on a standard laboratory chow (Altromin) or isocaloric high-fat
diet with 1.25% (w/w) of cholesterol (western diet) for another 16
weeks. For validation of LiverSex three objects defining the diet
have been included in the model: sources of glucose, cholesterol,
and triglycerides. Experimental conditions were simulated in
the model by altering the nutrient (triglyceride and cholesterol)
influx into the network, thus mimicking the experimental
diets. Inconsistencies between biological observations and model
simulations mainly occurred due to the missing components and
regulatory connections in the model. A series of simulations
was executed to identify the network components that caused
erroneous behavior. Further in-depth literature searches were
performed in the context of these components to identify the
regulations that were absent in the network or were incorrectly
depicted. The western diet was replicated in silico by increasing
the influx of triglycerides (10-fold) and cholesterol (five-fold)
(fold-changes were estimated from the strict composition of
western diet and standard laboratory chow).
Sensitivity Analysis
Sensitivity analysis can provide valuable insight in the robustness
of the computational model in dependence on the perturbations
of model inputs, i.e., parameters values (Bentele et al., 2004).
Moreover, sensitivity analysis can identify parameters with the
greatest impact on the observed outputs. These parameters
present potential targets for further experimental analysis (Zi,
2011). Sensitivity analysis has an important function in the
analysis of computational models in systems biology and
medicine (Ingalls, 2008). Metabolic Control Analysis (MCA)
presents a sensitivity analysis method (Fell and Sauro, 1985)
that was initially focused to the analysis of metabolic networks.
The method was later adapted to the models of other biological
networks such as cell signaling models, models of genetic
networks, and models of other biological processes (Westerhoff
et al., 1984; Heinrich and Schuster, 1996). MCA assesses the
sensitivity of the model output with respect to the selected
input with evaluation of control coefficients. Here, metabolic
fluxes through the observed metabolic reactions or concentration
of metabolites can be used as model outputs while model
parameters can be used as model inputs. The MCA of the
distribution of the metabolic fluxes in each of the pathway
branches can be performed with the following equation:

According to our previous experimental data and the
literature data the NAFLD pathogenesis can be associated with
de novo lipogenesis (Lorbek et al., 2013, 2015; Green et al.,
2015; Sanders and Griffin, 2016; Softic et al., 2016). Our analyses
of NAFLD progression were thus based on the observation of
triglyceride accumulation. The variations in their accumulation
were observed in dependence on the distribution of metabolic
fluxes at pathway branch points, which can be described as
model inputs. The concentration control coefficient from the
Equation (1) was thus defined as a partial derivate of the
alterations in triglyceride concentration with respect to the
small changes in the distribution of fluxes at pathway branch
points:

their corresponding metabolic pathways, which have the largest
gender-dependent influence on NAFLD progression.

To evaluate the sensitivity of hepatic triglyceride
concentration in dependence on the metabolic flux distribution
of LiverSex, the triglyceride influx into the model was raised
by 10-fold to imitate high fat diet. The distribution parameter
for each branch point in the pathway model was varied
incrementally by 5% up to a maximum of 30%. Further
investigation was focused on the analysis of gender-based
influences of regulatory factors on the previously identified
metabolic pathways. We calculated the concentration control
coefficient of regulatory factors, i.e., C

where X is replaced with regulator R from the list of molecular

for each of the molecular regulators.
RESULTS
Construction of LiverSex by Modeling
Hormonal Regulation With SysBio Library
LiverSex is composed of mathematical expressions of
relationships between sex hormones and growth hormone,
their corresponding receptors in hepatocytes and is based on
literature evidence. An object named hormonal regulation is
inserted into the blood section of the model. This object is
connected with corresponding pathways in the hepatocyte. As
explained in detail in the Materials and Methods section, it
includes androgens, estrogens, and growth hormone (Figure 1).
Each group of hormones has an effect on its corresponding
receptor. The behavior of hormones is determined by gender,
which results in two gender-specific models.
LiverSex Validation With Experimental Data
Three objects describing the diet have been included in LiverSex:
glucose source, cholesterol source, and triglyceride source.
Experimental conditions were mimicked in the model by altering
the substrate (triglyceride and cholesterol) influx into the
network in dependence on the experimental diets investigated
(standard laboratory diet and western diet).
The set of 45 genes that were differentially expressed between
females and males in mice fed with altromin and western diets
(Lorbek et al., 2013, 2015) was screened for genes that are
regulated inversely in females and males: either upregulated
in males and downregulated in females or vice versa. Three
inversely expressed genes were obtained (Figure 2A). The 1-
AcylGlycerol-3-Phosphate O-AcylTransferase gene Agpat which
is involved in lipid and glucose metabolism, and Protein
Kinase AMP-Activated catalytic subunit Alpha gene Prkaa were
downregulated in males and upregulated in females, while the
Insulin Receptor Substrate gene Irs, which is involved in insulin
signaling pathway, was upregulated in males and downregulated
in females. While the simulation results obtained by the SteatoNet
could only be attributed to males (Figure 2B), LiverSex correctly
described the data from both genders (Figures 2C,D).

standard laboratory diet and western diet). For these genes, we looked up the log2 fold change values and p-values for the comparison of both diets in wild-type
female and male mice. (B) SteatoNet simulation results represent only the male gender. (C) LiverSex simulation results represent the male gene expression response

That Trigger NAFLD
With sensitivity analysis we were able to identify metabolic
reactions with the largest gender dependent influence on hepatic
triglyceride accumulation, which is considered as the initial stage
of NAFLD. Table 1 shows concentration control coefficients with
respect to hepatic triglyceride accumulation listed in direction
from the maximal to the minimal differences in sensitivity
values for males and females. Only the first 20 parameters
are listed in Table 1 (see Supplementary Material for the full
list of parameters—Supplementary Table 1). If we classify the
metabolic reaction with C
TG
f >1 as highly sensitive with respect
to hepatic triglyceride accumulation, only 3 reactions can be
regarded as highly sensitive: transformation of monoacylglycerol
to glycerol (k159), transport of triglycerides from liver to
adipose triglyceride lipid droplets (k177), and transformation
of acetoacetate to β-hydroxybutyrate (k152). Transformation
of monoacylglycerol to glycerol and transport of hepatic

triglycerides to adipose triglyceride lipid droplets are highly
sensitive metabolic pathways in both genders, but metabolic
reaction from acetoacetate to β-hydroxybutyrate, which is a part
of the body ketone metabolism, shows a higher tendency for
female hepatic triglyceride accumulation only.
The concentration control coefficients reflect the impact
of perturbations on metabolite concentration. In our case,
these coefficients measure the relative steady-state change in
triglyceride accumulation in response to the relative change in
fluxes at metabolic branch points. Data obtained with sensitivity
analysis are sorted by descending absolute difference of sensitivity
values between male and female. It is interesting that the first
few pathways show a predominant effect in females (Figure 3).
The terminal degradation of triglycerides by conversion of
monoacylglycerol to glycerol (k159) seems to be the most
powerful flux in the network in both sexes. However, upon
perturbation with the diet, triglyceride accumulation is affected
more in females. Hepatic glycerol utilization is a metabolic
pathway, which is preferentially connected with carbohydrate
metabolism in men and lipid metabolism in women (Rodríguez
et al., 2015). Females display a higher sensitivity to ketone
body metabolism (k152), transport of triglycerides (k177), and
VLDL transport (k500), which carries triglycerides from the liver,
possibly to avoid the development of fatty liver, taking them to
the peripheral tissues for storage in adipose or for use in skeletal
muscle.
Regulatory Factors Involved in
Sex-Dependent Differences in NAFLD
Progression
Pathway branch points with the most significant absolute
difference of C
TG
f
between sexes were further investigated to
identify regulatory factors, which are sensitive to alterations
in flux distribution at these branches. By calculating C
R
f with
respect to various regulatory factors in the LiverSex, we
obtained results presented in Table 2 and Supplementary
Table 2. Figure 4 illustrates the regulatory factors with high
sensitivity to alterations in flux distributions within the respective
metabolic pathways. PGC1A (Peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha, known also as PPARGC1A),
which induces mitochondrial biogenesis, PPARα (Peroxisome
Proliferator Activated Receptor alpha), the major regulator of
lipid metabolism, FXR (Farnesoid X Receptor), a regulator of
bile acid synthesis and excretion, LXR (Liver X Receptor),
involved in lipid and cholesterol metabolism, and ADIPO
(adiponectin), which is involved in glucose regulation and
fatty acid oxidation, display global sensitivity to alterations
in metabolic flux distribution at the majority of the high
sensitivity pathway branches, indicating the broad role of these
transcription factors.
DISCUSSION
Object oriented modeling can be successfully employed to
support hierarchical structuring, reuse and evolution of more
complex models, independently of the application domain.

This also holds true for the LiverSex, where SteatoNet is
reused for adaptation to gender specific data. An object with
hormonal regulation is added to the SysBio library and after that
positioned into SteatoNet and connected to the liver based on
literature data. These models are constructed manually, i.e., by
connecting the SysBio objects that correspond to the biological
entities within the observed network. We are, however, currently
working on the automation of this construction process. The
LiverSex model by itself has certain limitations, which mainly
originate from the derivation of the SysBio library, which is
used for model construction. In order to reduce the space of
unknown parameters, the SysBio library objects presume the
normalized steady-state of the system. Obtained results thus
do not correspond to the actual concentrations of observed
metabolites due to the normalization of their concentrations
(Naik et al., 2014). The LiverSex was, however, successful in
replicating the results that correspond to different mice strains
as well as human data found in the literature.
The mechanism responsible for NAFLD progression in
humans is not yet fully understood. Furthermore, sex differences
have a big impact on the prevalence of NAFLD. Based on
the current data, premenopausal women are better protected
from developing NAFLD compared to men and postmenopausal
women (Ballestri et al., 2017). In this study, we tried to
expose the sexual differences in NAFLD based on hepatic
triglyceride accumulation. After performing sensitivity analyses,
metabolic differences between sexes in NAFLD were identified
(see Figure 4). Sensitivity analyses pinpointed to metabolic
pathways, in which the same perturbations cause the largest
differences in hepatic triglyceride accumulation. According to
the literature data all metabolic pathways with a high sensitivity
for hepatic triglyceride accumulation as reported by LiverSex are
involved in the earliest stage of NAFLD pathogenesis (Cohen
et al., 2011). One of the initial steps of NAFLD is hepatic steatosis,
which is characterized by the deposition of triglycerides as lipid
droplets (Reingold et al., 2005) and according to the results of
the sensitivity analyses of LiverSex, this metabolic step is more
sensitive in females.
Microsomal triglyceride transfers protein (MTTP) facilitates
triglyceride, cholesteryl ester, and phospholipid transport
between phospholipid surfaces (k500). A defect in lipid export
from the liver may also contribute to the pathogenesis of steatosis
(Fabbrini et al., 2008). MTTP is necessary for the assembly and
secretion of VLDL from hepatocytes (Jamil et al., 1995). It is
responsible for lipoprotein assembly by transferring triglycerides,
to nascent apolipoproteins B. The LiverSex demonstrates that
transferring triglycerides by MTTP, which is involved in NAFLD
progression, is more sensitive in females. It was previously
reported that MTTP expression is sex-dependent and that female
GH secretory pattern has a significant influence on its expression
(Améen and Oscarsson, 2003).
Hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) converts monoacylglycerides
to free fatty acids and glycerol (MGLL or MAGL) (k159) and
this step regulates the quantity of fatty acids, which are used as
signaling molecules and have been shown to promote cancer cell
migration, invasion and tumor growth (Nomura et al., 2010).
MAGL is a crucial lipolytic enzyme and an important regulator
of tumor progression. It can promote hepatocellular carcinoma

progression and was recently suggested as a potential therapeutic
target and as a biomarker for prognosis in patients with HCC
(Zhu et al., 2016). Expression of HSL is decreased in NAFLD
compared with normal liver (Kohjima et al., 2007), which was
also observed in our simulation results. There is currently no
literature data describing the sex-specific differences in the
expression of liver HSL. However, differences were reported
previously in skeletal muscles, where women were found to have
a higher intramuscular triacylglycerol during exercise than men,
and also higher mRNA levels of HSL in the muscle. Yet, as HSL
activity during prolonged exercise is higher in men it is likely
that the enzyme-substrate interactions differ between the sexes
(Roepstorff et al., 2006). In addition, our results show that women
have a higher susceptibility to changes in lipolysis. show that
women have a higher susceptibility to changes in lipolysis.
Removal of FA from the liver occurs by secretion as VLDL
(k500) and by FA oxidation (k152) (Hodson and Frayn, 2011).
Some studies suggest women have enhanced production and
clearance of VLDL compared to men (Wang et al., 2011). Few
studies have investigated sex-specific differences in FA oxidation
and found out that after a prolonged overnight fasting, women
metabolize FA toward 3-hydroxybutyrate (3OHB) to a greater
extent than men (Halkes et al., 2003; Marinou et al., 2011).
Other studies (Koutsari et al., 2011; Marinou et al., 2011) indicate
that women exhibit a higher non-oxidative FFA disposal (i.e.,
esterification and storage as triglycerides) and, after an overnight
fast, they are prone to partition fatty acids toward ketone
body production rather than VLDL. These differences were also
reflected by our LiverSex model.
Partition of fatty acids to ketone body production, VLDL
synthesis and fatty acids oxidation, together with deposition of
triglycerides as lipid droplets are considered as parts of NAFLD
pathology, which were all found to be more sensitive in females
in response to a high-fat diet challenge. The ability to partition
fatty acids into different pathways might be one of the possible
protective mechanisms in females leading to delayed NAFLD
progression compared to males. However, further research is
needed to confirm this hypothesis.
There are few metabolic pathways for which regulators
do not show sexual dimorphism, such as transformation of
monoacylglycerides to glycerol, fructose-1,6 bisphosphate to
dihidroxyacetone phosphate and transport of cholesterol from
blood to peripheral tissues. However, transport of fatty acidsfrom
blood to peripheral tissues and cholesterol from blood to the
adipose tissue are pathways, in which regulatory factors differ
substantially between genders. The activity of regulatory factors
such as PGC1A, PPARα, FXR, and LXR is highly related to gender
(see Figure 4).
Several studies have focused on the analysis of mice with
liver-specific knockouts crucial for growth hormone signaling

proteins indicating an important role of growth hormone in
hepatic triglyceride secretion (Cui et al., 2007; Fan et al., 2009;
Barclay et al., 2011; Sos et al., 2011). Pgc1a has been proposed
as one of the transcriptional targets responsible for steatosis (Cui
et al., 2007; Fan et al., 2009; Barclay et al., 2011; Sos et al., 2011)
and based on our observations women are more susceptible for
this. Skeletal muscle-specific PGC-1a overexpression increased
glucose uptake, glycogen and lipid droplets quantity (Mormeneo
et al., 2012), raising the possibility that PGC1A could also
promote triglyceride accumulation into adipose lipid droplets as
predicted by our model.
PPARα is known to be highly expressed in the liver and
exhibits a sex-dimorphic nature. In the liver, PPARα promotes
fatty acid oxidation, which makes it a possible drug target
for treating hypertriglyceridemia (Rando and Wahli, 2011). In
PPARα-null mice, gross hepatic abnormalities, disclosed to the

steatotic liver and hepatomegaly, were found in males, but
not females (Costet et al., 1998). LiverSex revealed a higher
capacity of females to secrete triglycerides via VLDL compared
to males, which was also the presumed cause for the increased
steatosis resistance in female PPARα-null mice (Lindén et al.,
2001).
Literature search did not reveal any sex-dependent FXR and
LXR correlation to liver. FXR modulates hepatic inflammation,
thus, FXR sex-dimorphic function in that context is less
clear (Rando and Wahli, 2011). Indication that many of the
FXR, PPARα, LXRα overlapping binding sites are functional
(Boergesen et al., 2012) might present the reason for sexdimorphic behavior of these nuclear receptors. Higher FXR
sensitivity to the triglycerides accumulation in females could
be correlated with higher binding of Retinoic X Receptor
(RXRα), which is obligate heterodimerization partner of FXR
to female hepatic chromatin for the essential lipid processing
genes (Kosters et al., 2013). In addition, these sex-specific
binding patterns and differences in ligand responsiveness may
be the reasons for sex-specific distinctive effects of drugs.
LXRs act as liver lipid sensors and regulate the metabolism of
cholesterol and fatty acids (Schultz et al., 2000). LXR indirectly
regulates Srebp1c, which is directly acting on Pnpla3 (Huang
et al., 2010). It has been previously reported that LXR is not
the subject of regulation by either dietary cholesterol or sex
(Lorbek et al., 2013; Feillet et al., 2016), but LiverSex reported
higher sensitivity of LXR in males in the initial steps of
NAFLD.
Several nuclear receptors together with their molecular
cascades are promising pharmacological targets for NAFLD
treatment (Serviddio et al., 2013). Based on the results obtained
by LiverSex, PGC1A, PPARα, FXR, and LXR could provide
novel pharmacological targets for sex-based therapy in the
future. Although the various studies emphasize the importance
of regulators in modulating hepatic lipid homeostasis, data
regarding the sex-dependent effects on the development of
steatosis is still missing, emphasizing the need for further studies.
Our results suggest that one of the major hepatic
characteristics is its sexually dimorphic nature. Sex steroids
and growth hormone play a crucial role in fine-tuning the
sex-dependent metabolic pathways in the liver. Further studies
of sexually dimorphic genes and pathways as well as differences
in their expression, are required for better insights into the
complex functions of the liver and the relation to disease
progression in both sexes. LiverSex and its future extensions
in the context of personalized models may help with finding
preventive approaches for NAFLD as well as other liver related
sex-specific diseases.
