We conducted a phylogenetic analysis of 19 hepatitis 
B virus strains from Laos that belonged to 2 subgenotypes 
of a new genotype I. This emerging new genotype likely developed outside Southeast Asia and is now found in mixed 
infections and in recombinations with local strains in a geographically confi ned region.
As a result of mutations and recombinations, hepatitis B virus (HBV) has evolved into 8 known genotypes 
(A–H), with a putative new genotype I recently found in 
Asia (1,2). Some genotypes have been associated with distinct clinical patterns, and their detection and identifi cation 
are important for virus and disease surveillance.
In Laos, 8.7% of the population are chronically infected with HBV, and perinatal transmission is the most 
common route of infection. Here, we present the phylogenetic analysis of 19 related strains found in voluntary blood 
donors from Laos that cluster with the new genotype I.
The Study
Phylogenetic analysis of sequences obtained from 
hepatitis B surface antigen–positive fi rst-time blood donors from donation centers in Vientiane City and central 
provinces of Laos showed that 163 (42.2%) strains were 
of genotype B, and 204 (55.4%) were of genotype C. Subgenotypes included B2 (18), B3 (1), B4 (128), and B5 
(16), as well as C2 (190), C3 (1), and C5 (13) (Figure 
1, panel A). Nineteen strains, including 15 complete sequences, did not group with any of the known genotypes 
A–H. These sequences formed 2 clusters, which were 
emerging from a common node (bootstrap value of 100%; 
Figure 1, panel A). One of the clusters grouped with a 
recently reported single strain from Vietnam, for which 
we had previously defi ned a new genotype I (2). The 2 
new groups from Laos will be referred to here as subgenotypes I1 and I2. Notably, all I1 strains were of serotype 
adw, whereas all I2 subgenotypes were of serotype ayw. 
With 1 exception, all genotype I strains were found in donors living in Vientiane City. Strains recovered from Hanoi, Vietnam, 8 years ago and reported as aberrant strains 
(3) also group with subgenotype I1.
Detailed analysis of full genome sequences showed 
that genotype C strains as a group were most closely related 
to genotype I (average Kimura distance of 7.89%, Table 
1). The closest subgenotype was C3 with a 7.0% average 
Kimura distance (data not shown). The bootstrap value of 
the separating node was 92% (Figure 1, panel A), which is 
well above the bootstrap value of the G/DE node. On the S 
gene level, genotype I was most closely related to genotype 
G with a distance of 4.23% and a bootstrap value of 96% 
at the separating node (data not shown). Within the 2 subgenotypes I1 and I2, an average diversity over the complete 
genome of 1.19% and 0.94% was calculated; this difference increased to 2.33% when all strains were considered 
as a single group. The maximal genetic distance between 
2 full-length genotype I strains was 4.3%. All cluster-

ings were verifi ed by maximum likelihood tree construction (data not shown). Thus, in accordance with published 
criteria (4), these values warrant the defi nition of a new 
genotype I with 2 subgenotypes I1 and I2.
Most current genotypes of HBV seem to be the result of 
1 or several recombination events (5). In particular, this is 
evident for the B/C recombinant, which has spread in mainland Asia (6) and has been defi ned as genotype Ba. Also 
genotypes B and C show some similarity with each other 
(Figure 2). Bootscan analysis (7) of all genotype I strains, 
including M04–3665, amplifi ed by complete genome PCR, 
showed similarities with genotype C (nt 1400–3000), A (nt 
3000–400), and G (nt 400–1400) by using a window size 
of 800 nt (Figure 2). Smaller bootscan windows tended to 
blur the relatedness. Phylogenetic reconstruction (Figure 1, 
panels B–D) and BLAST searches (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov) (Table 2) of the above fragments of genotype I 
sequences confi rmed the results of the bootscan analysis, 
which suggests that this genotype may also have evolved 
from a series of recombination events in a distant past.

New Hepatitis B Virus Genotype, Southeast Asia
The genotype C–like fragment was most closely related 
to subgenotype C3 (Table 2), thus far found only in the Pacifi c, except for a single incomplete strain in Laos (from this 
study). C1, found in Japan, Korea, the People’s Republic of 
China, and Uzbekistan (8,9), is the second most closely related subgenotype. The genotype A–like fragment was most 
similar to subgenotypes A3 and A4, recently found by us 
and confi rmed by others in sub-Saharan Africa (10–12). The 
apparent relatedness with the defective genotype G is even 
more surprising, since it has only been found sporadically 
in the United States, Japan, Germany, and France (13–15). 
Thus, none of the contributing genotypes or subgenotypes 
have ever been identifi ed in Southeast Asia, which evokes 
questions about the origin of genotype I in this region.
To further exclude artifacts of mixed infections, various genome regions of 15 genotype I strains were cloned. 
The 92 clones analyzed clustered with the same group as 
the uncloned parent sequences. In just 2 cases, for which 
only the preS/S gene was available for analysis (M05–0659 
and M04–2769), a mixed infection with several genotypes 
was found. The fi rst (M05–0659) contained an I1 and I1/
B4 recombinant sequence (B4 on the last 300 nt), while the 
second (M04–2769) contained 5 different species: 1 B5/C2 
recombinant (C2 on the last 400 nt), 1 C5/C2 recombinant 
(C2 on the last 400 nt), 1 genotype C2 sequence, 4 genotype C5 sequences, and 1 C/I2 recombinant (C subgenotype unclear; I2 on nt 200–600).
Four strains with no signs of mixed infections in the 
sequence electropherograms clustered inconclusively in the 
phylogenetic analysis of partial sequences (data not shown). 
These strains were cloned and identifi ed by bootscan analysis as recombinants between several genotypes and/or subgenotypes. In 3 recombinants, only subgenotypes I1 and 
I2 were involved (M04–3739, M04–2531, and M04–0309). 
The 2 latter recombinants had identical bootscan patterns 
(I1 between nt 1400–1900), while in the fi rst recombinant, 
the I2 sequence was shifted downstream by 200 nt (data 
not shown). Strain C04–0790 showed a similar pattern to 
M04–3739, but the I1 sequence was replaced by a C2 sequence. Bootscan analysis of a previously reported strain 
(GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ no. AB231909) showed a B4/I1 
recombinant with the I1 sequence identifi ed between positions 600 and 1864. The most similar strains for each of 
the distinct regions of these recombinants are virtually all 
circulating in Laos (this study). In fact, the C2 sequence 
of the C04–0790 recombinant strain was identical to the 
C04–1257 strain found in a different district of Vientiane. 
This strain could have been a potential donor strain.
Conclusions
In a preliminary report, we discussed the need to assign a new genotype (I) to strains that we had found in Laos 
(1). More recently, Tran et al. defi ned a new genotype I 
on the basis of a single, similar strain from Vietnam (2). 
Here we analyzed a larger number of new sequences which 
formally comply with the defi nition of a new genotype (I) 
and 2 subgenotypes of it. A complex recombination pattern 
suggests that genotype I was formed by recombinations 
outside of Southeast Asia before spreading within Laos and 
Vietnam, and giving birth to a new genotype with subgenotypes, which later recombined with regional strains. Identifi cation and analysis of genotype I strains provide further 
evidence of the importance of recombination in the evolution and genesis of new HBV genotypes, a complexity not 
fully acknowledged by the current genotype classifi cation.
