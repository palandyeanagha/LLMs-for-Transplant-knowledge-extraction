Clinical observations and experimental studies have determined that systemic acid-base
disturbances can profoundly affect the heart. A wealth of information is available on
the effects of altered pH on cardiac function but, by comparison, much less is known
about the actions of the organic anions that accumulate alongside H+ ions in acidosis.
In the blood and other body fluids, these organic chemical species can collectively
reach concentrations of several millimolar in severe metabolic acidoses, as in the case
of inherited organic acidemias, and exert powerful biological actions on the heart that
are not intuitive to predict. Indeed, cardiac pathologies, such as cardiomyopathy and
arrhythmia, are frequently reported in organic acidemia patients, but the underlying
pathophysiological mechanisms are not well established. Research efforts in the area
of organic anion physiology have increased dramatically in recent years, particularly for
propionate, which accumulates in propionic acidemia, one of the commonest organic
acidemias characterized by a high incidence of cardiac disease. This Review provides a
comprehensive historical overview of all known organic acidemias that feature cardiac
complications and a state-of-the-art overview of the cardiac sequelae observed in
propionic acidemia. The article identifies the most promising candidates for molecular
mechanisms that become aberrantly engaged by propionate anions (and its metabolites),
and discusses how these may result in cardiac derangements in propionic acidemia. Key
clinical and experimental findings are considered in the context of potential therapies in
the near future.

INTRODUCTION
Inherited metabolic disorders (IMDs), classically known as inborn errors of metabolism, are
a collection of over 500 diseases, each caused by an inherited defect in genes coding for
a metabolic enzyme. Although individually rare, as a collective they affect 1 in 2,000 births
worldwide (1). IMDs exist for essentially every metabolic pathway, from fatty acid oxidation, to
the urea cycle, and a number of them can be detected during newborn screening by tandem
mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Recently, the role of whole-exome sequencing was evaluated as an

Park et al. Cardiac Complications in Organic Acidemias
innovative methodology to aid in the diagnosis of infants
with abnormal MS/MS screens (2). Organic acidemias (OAs),
sometimes referred to as organic acidurias, are a subset of 17
IMDs that are characterized by the excessive accumulation of
organic acids in body fluids. OAs have been divided into three
categories: (1) systemic, (2) cerebral, and (3) ketolytic/ketogenic
(3), although this naming system is problematic because changes
related to the brain are common in all OAs and the canonical
cerebral OAs can also develop non-neurologic manifestations
(4). With the advent of chemical assays capable of defining the
metabolite milieu of blood, OAs have been related to specific
metabolic signatures, some of which have diagnostic value.
Modern genetic techniques have described the gene mutations
that give rise to the metabolite disorder, and even provided some
degree of insight into gene-function relationships.
A feature of many OAs is the accumulation of organic acid
metabolites that directly relate to the mutated enzyme, typically
accompanied by a build-up of various other acidic metabolites
particularly during stages of metabolic decompensation, such
as lactate, 3-hydroxybutyrate or acetoacetate. The clinical
management of OAs is broadly based on the same principles,
namely, the reversal or prevention of catabolism, limiting
exposure to precursors of the substrate that cannot be
metabolized, and scavenging toxic intermediates (3).
OAs are severe diseases that can affect multiple organ systems.
Many OAs present in the neonatal or infantile period with
a wide anion gap, metabolic acidosis and hyperammonemia.
However, of the 17 known OAs, around half are known
to cause cardiac dysfunction (Organic Acidemia Association,
2020). The disorder most strongly associated with cardiac
sequelae is the life-threatening disease, propionic acidemia (PA),
first reported by Dr. Barton Childs in 1961. PA, a relatively
frequent type of OA, is characterized by an accumulation of
propionate and other related metabolites, and is a systemic
disorder resulting in widespread end-organ damage (5). Acute
illness is typically a result of metabolic decompensation and
acidosis. A common complication in PA is cardiomyopathy and
arrhythmia, and while the underlying mechanisms are not yet
fully established, notable achievements have been made recently
(6–8). Methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), a condition closely
related to PA, is also recognized to produce cardiac dysfunction,
albeit not as frequently as in the case with PA. Similarly, there
have been documented cases of heart disease in glutaric aciduria
type II (multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency) and type II
D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria.
As their name implies, OAs have two distinct chemical
components: H+ ions (which determine pH) and the conjugate
organic anions. In aqueous solution, these ionic species are, in
essence, fully dissociated, and can act via separate mechanisms.
The maintenance of a favorable pH is a homeostatic priority,
which is manifested by the observation that plasma pH is
regulated within a narrow range of 7.35 to 7.45. The principal
pH buffer present in plasma is CO2/HCO−
3
, therefore the
concentration of H+ ions, HCO−
3
ions and CO2 gas is in a
dynamic equilibrium. Acid-base disturbances can emerge from
a change in [HCO−
3
] at constant partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2),
referred to as a metabolic acidosis (fall in [HCO−
3
]) or metabolic
alkalosis (rise in [HCO−
3
]) (9). The type of acid-base disturbance
encountered in OAs is a metabolic acidosis (Figure 1A). A wealth
of information is now available on the effects of H+ ions on
the heart (10–12). By acting as post-translational modifiers of
proteins, H+ ions can alter biological functions by protonating
amino acid residues, such as histidine. The low extracellular pH
in uncompensated metabolic acidoses can modulate the heart by
directly acting on surface-expressed proteins (13). Additionally,
extracellular acidity can drive a fall in intracellular pH (14), and
thus gain access to a myriad of intracellular targets, most of which
show some degree of pH-sensitivity, including most elements of
excitation-contraction coupling (10, 15, 16). For example, even
minor reductions in pHifrom its physiological set-point (near
7.2) is capable of eliciting acute contractile depression, deranged
Ca2+ handling, intracellular Na+ overload, and triggering of
arrhythmias (10, 17).
In contrast, much less is known about the biological actions
of the various organic anions associated with OAs. As organic
acids accumulate in OAs, the concentrations of H+ ions and
organic anions increase in tandem, but since the former is
heavily buffered, its relative rise is orders of magnitude smaller.
Whereas, the drop in pH during a metabolic acidosis may
be equivalent to a sub-micromolar change in free [H+], the
accumulation of organic anions in blood may reach millimolar
levels (18–20) (Figure 1B). Furthermore, because the body’s pHregulatory apparatus is designed to sense and handle H+ ions,
rather than organic anions, the latter may accumulate with little
homeostatic oversight. OAs can result in the production of
several different types of organic anions (e.g., lactate, propionate),
and their collective concentration can be estimated from the socalled anion gap, usually calculated as [Na+] + [K+] – [Cl−]
– [HCO−
3
]. A high anion gap metabolic acidosis is a frequent
observation in organic acidemias, attributable to a high collective
concentration of organic acids that are not measured routinely
in blood tests (9). A metabolic acidosis can become compensated
by hyperventilation to reduce pCO2. Whereas, this compensatory
maneuver can restore normal pH, albeit at a reduced pCO2 and
[HCO−
3
], it does not per se remove the organic anion disturbance
(Figure 1A).
It is becoming increasingly clear that organic anions are not
biologically inert (21–24), and at least some of the common
presentations of OAs are attributable to actions of these
metabolites, rather than the pH per se. This notion is exemplified
by the fact that not all OAs are associated with cardiac disease. For
example, heart disease is not observed in isovaleric acidemia (25)
or pyroglutamic acidemia (5-oxoprolinemia) (26), two examples
of OAs associated with profound metabolic acidosis.
Studies of OAs provide a unique opportunity to appreciate
the biological actions of organic anions on integrated biological
systems. Here, we provide a historical account of all known
OAs that feature cardiac complications, starting with the first
documented case. We begin by presenting the commonest
OAs and aim to present the remaining disorders grouped
by the affected metabolic pathway. In order to better
understand the pathophysiology of cardiac dysfunction
in OAs, we take a focused approach on PA, the organic
acidemia that is most strongly associated with heart disease,
and which has been subject to a relatively larger number of
mechanistic studies.

]; if this
is associated with a fall in pH, it is known as an uncompensated metabolic acidosis (uMAc) and its trajectory is along the 5% CO2 isobar. This metabolic acidosis can
be compensated (cMAc) by hyperventilation to reduce CO2 and thus restore the [HCO−

metabolic acidosis, even small changes in pH can be related to major disturbances in the levels of organic anions, the conjugate bases of metabolic acids. Change in
pH was calculated as amount of acid added divided by buffering capacity. Buffering capacity due to non-carbonic sources was 35 mM/pH, and attributable mainly to
hemoglobin in red cells. Buffering capacity due to CO2/HCO−
3 was calculated assuming constancy of CO2 at 5% (i.e., 2.303×[HCO−3
]), as expected for an open
system. The calculation assumes a 0.2 pH gradient between plasma and red blood cell cytoplasm, and a hematocrit of 45%.
HISTORICAL OVERVIEW OF ORGANIC
ACIDEMIAS WITH CARDIAC
COMPLICATIONS
Cardiac complications have been reported in several organic
acidemias. For completion, we briefly describe all OAs associated
with cardiac disease, irrespective of whether they are a frequent
complication or only reported sporadically (Table 1). The
discovery of each OA is described, along with noteworthy
case studies describing cardiac complications. The metabolic
pathways implicated in the OAs discussed in this Review are
illustrated schematically in Figure 2.
SYSTEMIC ORGANIC ACIDEMIAS
Methylmalonic Acidemia (MMA) and
Propionic Acidemia (PA)
Metabolic Lesion and Presentation
MMA and PA are amongst the most frequent OAs and are
often considered in tandem because their enzymatic defects occur
along the same metabolic pathway. MMA and PA are inborn
errors of the catabolism of propionate, a short-chain fatty acid,
from branched chain amino acids (valine, isoleucine, methionine,
threonine), odd-chain fatty acids (OCFAs), and cholesterol (28).
PA is caused by defects in propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC),
a biotin-dependent enzyme that carboxylates propionyl-CoA
to D-methylmalonyl-CoA. PCC is a α6β6 heterododecamer
composed of PCCA and PCCB subunits, encoded by PCCA
and PCCB, respectively, and PA can result from mutations
in either gene (29). D-methylmalonyl-CoA is subsequently
racemized by methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase (methylmalonylCoA racemase) to L-methylmalonyl-CoA. Disorders of MMA
includes a heterogeneous group of disorders caused by several
different deficiencies: (1) in methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase; (2)
in L-methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MCM), which isomerizes Lmethylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA; (3) defects in cobalamin
absorption or intracellular trafficking; (4) intracellular defects
involving the distal steps of the cobalamin processing pathway
(cblA, cblB, cblD2) impacting solely on the synthesis of the cofactor adenosylcobalamin essential for MCM activity, resulting
in isolated MMA; (5) intracellular defects involving the proximal
steps in the cobalamin processing pathway (cblC, cblD, cblE, cblF,
cblG, cblJ) impacting on the synthesis of both methylcobalamin,
the co-factor for methionine synthase, and adenosylcobalamin,
the co-factor for MCM activity, resulting in combined MMA and
homocystinuria (28, 30).
The reduction in MCM activity causes the characteristic
systemic accumulation of methylmalonyl-CoA and
methylmalonic acid. However, because of the proximity of the
biochemical lesion to PA, MMA shares many of the metabolites
that are detected during plasma and urinary screening, including
propionyl-carnitine, 2-methylcitrate, 3-hydroxypropionate,
propionyl-glycine, and glycine (5). MMA and PA generally
manifest with a more severe early-onset neonatal form, and a
milder late-onset form presenting later in infancy, childhood,
or adolescence (although there is no clear definition of what
is considered “late”) (5). Their initial clinical presentations are
similar. In the neonatal onset form, patients typically present
with pancytopenia and encephalopathy, as well as a string of

Whilst cardiac dysfunction has been reported in both of the commonest OAs, PA and MMA, cardiac disease only occurs commonly in PA. Collated information from the U.S. NIH

metabolic disturbances, including high anion gap metabolic
acidosis, ketoacidosis, and hyperammonemia (5). Chronically,
MMA and PA typically present with similar signs and symptoms,
such as developmental delay, dystonia, recurrent vomiting
with ketoacidosis, and failure to thrive. However, they tend to
differ clinically, in that MMA patients predominantly develop
chronic renal failure, whereas PA patients commonly present
with cardiomyopathy and prolonged QT intervals (5, 28).
Cardiac disease has been noted in MMA. Prada et al.
(31) reported HCM in a 22-year-old who died of ventricular
fibrillation (VF)-induced cardiac arrest (see Box 1 and Box 2).
In the same series, they documented a 4-years-old who had
paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and heart failure (HF)
secondary to DCM, who died due to cardiorespiratory arrest. It
should be noted however that cardiac disease is not common in
MMA. In a large case study of 273 MMA patients, only 4 (∼1%)
had cardiomyopathy (32). In contrast, cardiomyopathy is a lot
more common in PA, with an incidence rate of ∼9–23% (28),
whilst the incidence of long QT syndrome has been reported to
be as high as 70% (33). Since PA is a focus of this Review, we have
dedicated an entire section (Cardiac Dysfunction In Propionic
Acidemia) on providing a detailed account and analysis of the
cardiac complications encountered in PA.
The seminal report describing MMA was made by Oberholzer
et al. (34) in two unrelated infants, and included the results
of a thorough metabolic workup enabling identification of
the metabolic defect. The discovery of PA was the least
straightforward of all the OAs, spanning a decade of research
between the 60 and 70’s. The index patient was a Caucasian
male born in 1957 and admitted to Johns Hopkins Hospital at
8 months of age with numerous signs and symptoms, including
vomiting, intellectual disability, ketosis, hyperglycinemia and

hyperglycinuria in the neonatal period. The seminal report was
published by Dr. Barton Childs in 1961, with the disorder
initially being referred to as “idiopathic hyperglycinemia,” based
on the most unusual biochemical finding being significantly
raised plasma glycine (35). Their key observation was that
when specific amino acids were administered (leucine, isoleucine,
valine, threonine, methionine), the patient’s symptoms worsened,
whereas a decrease in blood acidosis, glycine, and ketones
was observed when these amino acids were restricted in
the diet (36).
Interestingly, the first hint of the basic defect underlying
idiopathic hyperglycinemia was borne not from studying the
disease itself, but rather the closely related, MMA. Following the
discovery of MMA by Oberholzer et al. (34), a study published
by a team from Yale (37) provided speculation that the primary
biochemical lesion in idiopathic hyperglycinemia was at the level
of PCC.
The first report actually using a term close to PA was a case
report published by Hommes et al. (38) from the Netherlands,
describing fatal “propionic acidemia” in a male neonate with
severe metabolic acidosis and very high propionic acid in
blood (5.4 mmol/L). The boy presented at 60 h of age with
hyperventilation and marked hypotonia but died at 104 h of age.
Initial laboratory studies showed a mild ketosis, and notably
a severe metabolic acidosis (pH 6.98). Importantly, Hommes
et al. applied the gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) method
developed by Tanaka et al. (39) employed in the discovery of
isovaleric acidemia (another OA), to measure plasma short-chain

BOX 1 | Glossary of cardiomyopathies encountered in OAs.
Around 5% of all IMDs are associated with cardiomyopathy (156), a
group of cardiac muscle disorders characterized by abnormal chamber
size, wall thickness and/or contractile function (157). Classifications
of cardiomyopathies are known by either AHA/ACC (American Heart
Association/American College of Cardiology) or ESC (European Society
of Cardiology) standards (142, 158). The types of cardiomyopathy
associated closely with OAs include dilated (DCM), hypokinetic non-dilated
(HNDC), hypertrophic (HCM), and left-ventricular non-compaction (LVNC)
cardiomyopathies (142).
HCM is defined as the presence of a hypertrophied, non-dilated ventricle, in
the absence of hemodynamic causes that are capable in eliciting the wall
thickening (e.g., physiological hypertrophy due to exercise, or pathological
hypertrophy due to aortic stenosis) (158). Common histological findings
include myocyte disarray and fibrosis (152). The genetic causes of HCM
are almost exclusively due to mutations of sarcomeric genes, unlike DCM.
Although HCM has been associated with several IMDs (158), it is not
frequently observed in OAs.
HNDC is a relatively new category introduced to describe patients
that have LV or biventricular systolic dysfunction (hypokinesia, or decreased
“wall-motion”), in the absence of dilatation or hypertrophy, or abnormal
loading conditions and coronary artery disease (142).
DCM is defined by the presence of left-ventricular (LV) or biventricular
dilatation, and systolic dysfunction (based on ejection fraction; EF), in the
absence of abnormal loading conditions (hypertension, valve disease),
or coronary artery disease. DCM is a common type of cardiomyopathy
worldwide and is the most frequent form observed in IMDs. DCM can occur
due to disorders isolated to the heart, for example from mutations in classical
“disease genes” such as the sarcomeric proteins titin (TTN) and myosin
heavy chain 7 (MYH7). However, unlike HCM, it can also be due to mutations
in genes accounting for different aspects of cell function, such as those
involved in energy production, myofilament activation and Ca2+ handling
(152). Notably, DCM can also occur due myocardial damage secondary
to systemic diseases, such as metabolic disorders (142, 143, 158). Key
complications with DCM include arrhythmias, decompensated heart failure
(HF), and cardiogenic shock (159).
LVNC is characterized by an outer compacted myocardial layer, and
an inner non-compacted layer featuring prominent trabeculations coincident
with large intertrabecular recesses (160). The pathophysiology of LVNC
is fascinating in its own right. Trabeculae are finger-like projections of the
myocardium and are a distinguishing feature of the developing embryonic
heart. Since the early developing heart is devoid of coronary vascularization,
the diffusion of nutrients and oxygen to the embryonic myocardium is
achieved by increasing surface area through the formation of trabeculae.
During the later stages of chamber maturation, the trabeculae itself
undergoes remodeling (compaction) whereby they collapse, compact, and
the spaces between the trabeculae gives rise to capillaries (161). However,
in LVNC, this compaction phase fails, leading to the characteristic trabeculae
that can be seen on cardiac imaging modalities.
fatty acids. Although isovaleric acid was absent, there was a
large peak coinciding with that of propionic acid, which was
calculated as being 40,000 µg/100 mL (5.4 mmol/L) using the
chromatogram peak area; Tanaka et al. (39) reported a normal
value of 28 µg/100 mL (3.8 µmol/L) propionic acid in healthy
control children. Based on this observation, and given that a
biosynthetic route of propionate is through the oxidation of
OCFAs, Hommes et al. performed GLC for free fatty acids and
triglycerides on post-mortem liver tissue, finding that C15/C17
BOX 2 | Glossary of arrhythmias encountered in OAs.
Cardiac arrhythmias can be grossly classified as supraventricular or
ventricular based on their anatomical site of origin. Ventricular arrhythmias
can be life-threatening as they can rapidly evolve to result in hemodynamic
instability and if untreated, cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death (SCD).
The ventricular arrhythmias frequently observed in OAs are ventricular
tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF). Though technically VF is
the “lethal” ventricular arrhythmia, VT can also be dangerous, as in the
absence of prompt treatment, it can progress to VF and circulatory arrest.
Ventricular arrhythmias usually occur due to abnormal structural substrates
(e.g. infarction, cardiomyopathy) or electrophysiological substrates (e.g. long
QT) in the myocardium.
Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is characterized by prolongation of the QT
interval in the electrocardiogram (EKG), and occurs due to abnormal cardiac
repolarization. The QT interval is related to the action potential duration. It is
normally reported as corrected QT (QTc), which normalizes for variation in
heart rate, since action potential duration changes with pacing frequency.
QT prolongation is a major pro-arrhythmic substrate that can cause sudden
cardiac death from life-threatening arrhythmias, notably VF and torsades de
pointes (TdP; polymorphic ventricular tachycardia) (162).
LQTS can either be congenital or acquired. There are 15 congenital
LQT sub-types (LQT1-LQT15), each associated with their own gene. The
majority of congenital LQTS is accounted for by mutations in KCNQ1 (IKs),
KCNH2 (IKr), or SCN5A (INa) (163). Acquired LQTS, the most likely form to
occur in OAs, can be due to a number of causes, including bradycardia,
drugs, and electrolyte disturbances (150). It is also known that additional
non-genetic factors (demographic and environmental) can act as disease
modifiers in LQTS, including for example, autonomic nervous system
neurotransmitter signaling (149). It has been shown that the KCNH2 channel
(hERG; IKr) accounts for almost all cases of acquired LQTS (162, 164).
OCFAs were raised. Taken together, given the block in conversion
of propionic acid to methylmalonic acid, and the increased
number of OCFAs (C15/C17) detected in liver, the authors
postulated that the observed disorder was consequent to an
absence of PCC.
Subsequent reports consolidated on the findings by Hommes
et al. (38), although their coining of “propionic acidemia” was
not immediately adopted by all research groups, with some
authors still referring to it as idiopathic hyperglycinemia. Hsia
et al. (40) published a study on propionate metabolism in
peripheral leukocytes obtained from a patient with “ketotic
hyperglycinemia,” and one with MMA. The authors had
renamed the term idiopathic hyperglycinemia to distinguish the
condition from other diseases that manifest hyperglycinemia,
but without ketoacidosis (41). In leukocytes from a ketotic
hyperglycinemia patient, Hsia et al. (40) found normal
metabolism of methylmalonate, but a failure to metabolize
propionate. In contrast, leukocytes from an MMA patient
could not metabolize methylmalonate, but propionate could
be successfully metabolized. The authors concluded that the
biochemical lesion in ketotic hyperglycinemia (i.e., PA) was in
the carboxylation of methylmalonate and speculated this was
due to defective PCC.
The study by Gompertz et al. (42) performed PCC and
MCM enzyme activity assays on mitochondria isolated from
post-mortem liver in a patient with fatal “propionic acidemia.”

Gompertz et al. found the level of PCC in the patient to
be 9.7% that of controls, whilst MCM activity was normal,
definitively localizing the enzymatic defect in PA to PCC. In
a subsequent study, Hsia et al. (43) performed flux isotope
tracer studies in cultured fibroblasts from a patient with “ketotic
hyperglycinemia” and found that they were unable to oxidize
propionate-14C to 14CO2, but oxidized methylmalonate-14C and
succinate-14C normally. PCC activity was determined to be <2%
normal activity in the fibroblasts. Furthermore, PCC activity was
∼50% of normal in both parents of the patient. Based on the
collective evidence from their study, combined with the work
of Gompertz et al. (42), Hsia et al. (43) concluded that “ketotic
hyperglycinemia” and “propionic acidemia” are the same disease,
caused by defective PCC, and that the defect is inherited as an
autosomal recessive trait.
Although propionate and propionyl-CoA are the first and
primary metabolites to accumulate with PCC dysfunction,
they are challenging substances to measure accurately from
a technical standpoint. Thus, the diagnosis of PA has relied
on more downstream metabolites directly borne from excess
propionate. The markers used clinically today to diagnose PA
include elevations of propionyl-carnitine, 2-methylcitrate, 3-
hydroxypropionate and propionyl-glycine in physiological fluids
(28, 44). Isotope tracer studies are frequently employed to study
propionate metabolism (or rather, IMDs in general), and the
discovery of these markers were borne from such studies. The use
of 3-hydroxypropionate and 2-methylcitrate as clinical markers
of PA were initially reported from the laboratory of Dr. William
Nyhan in the 1970’s through studying the metabolic flux of
[1-
14C] propionate intravenously infused into PA and MMA
patients (45, 46). Indeed, these markers have stood the test of
time, being the principle biochemical markers by which PA is
diagnosed today.
3-Methylglutaconic Aciduria Type II (Barth
Syndrome)
Metabolic Lesion and Presentation
3-methylglutaconic aciduria (3-MGA) type II, more commonly
referred to as Barth syndrome (BTHS), is a systemic OA
caused by mutations in the TAZ gene that codes for tafazzin
(previously known as G4.5). It is X-linked, occurring almost
exclusively in males (although one female has been reported
who had the mutation in both X chromosomes) (47). BTHS
results from a loss-of-function mutation of tafazzin, an acyltransferase located in the inner mitochondrial membrane
that catalyzes the remodeling of cardiolipin; cardiolipin has
been implicated in numerous aspects of physiology, but is
critically important in maintaining mitochondrial structure and
apoptosis (47, 48). Patients with BTHS have increased urinary
excretion of 3-methylglutaconic acid, and typically present with
a triad of key clinical features: dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM),
neutropenia and skeletal myopathy (47). Additionally, BTHS has
been associated with numerous cardiac pathologies, including
left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy (LVNC) and
ventricular arrhythmias, as discussed further below.
In the first study of its kind, examination of the BTHS registry
in 2012 found that ∼70% of BTHS patients have a form of
cardiomyopathy in their 1st year of life (49). We highlight below
a few reports only, including the historical study by Dr. Barth,
and reports describing common cardiac complications seen in
BTHS (DCM, LVNC, ventricular arrhythmias). We refer the
reader to reviews by Clarke et al. (47) and Jefferies (48) for more
comprehensive overviews on cardiac complications encountered
in BTHS.
BTHS was first described in a preliminary communication
by Dr. Peter Barth in 1981 and in the subsequent publication
(50), which reported the death of three boys from a large Dutch
family in the neonatal or infancy period due to cardiac failure
or septicemia, despite normal delivery and full-term gestation.
One boy (“case V-11”) presented at 4 days of age with severe
metabolic acidosis (arterial pH 6.94), cardiomegaly (chest Xray) and high white cell counts. The patient died 3 h after
admission due to sepsis, as confirmed by bacterial cultures
from multiple sample types. Another boy (“case V-12”) had
neutropenia on birth so was kept in hospital. Electrocardiogram
(EKG) and chest X-ray were normal, but a progressive lactic
acidosis was noted up till 10 days of age. After being discharged at
6 weeks of age, the patient presented at 15 months with dyspnea,
hypothermia, hypoglycemia and coma. On examination his EKG
was normal but had a gallop rhythm and significant cardiomegaly
(presumably DCM), and died of cardiac arrest the same day.
Associated Cardiac Defects
DCM and chronic heart failure (CHF) are common findings
in BTHS. One of the earlier published case series for these
conditions were by Kelley et al. (51), in which the boys in
this 7-patient series died either from HF or sepsis. “Patient
1” and “Patient 2” had signs of DCM and CHF at 2 days
of age which was treated with positive inotropes (digoxin)
and diuretics (furosemide). The boys had increased urinary
3-methylglutaconate and 3-methylglutarate and experienced
very poor growth during their 1st year. Although their cardiac
condition remained relatively stable, there was persistent DCM
(biventricular enlargement) and low left ventricular (LV)
fractional shortening (measure of contractility). “Patient 5”
presented with respiratory distress at 3 months of age. Further
investigation showed marked cardiomegaly, biventricular
dilatation, and severely reduced LV fractional shortening.
This patient was treated with carnitine, as well as digoxin and
furosemide, but no improvement in cardiac size and function
was seen at 4 years of age. “Patient 3” and “Patient 7” experienced
a similar syndrome, albeit over different timelines.
LVNC is another common cardiomyopathy encountered in
BTHS as described by Roberts et al. (49). Bleyl et al. (52) described
a family in which 6 individuals exhibited cardiomegaly and HF.
Aside from the sixth patient for which there is no data available,
all other patients in this series had chamber dilatation and coarse
trabeculation, indicative of LVNC.
A large observational cross-sectional study of cardiac
complications in BTHS patients demonstrated that DCM,
LVNC and ventricular arrhythmias remained a common
finding in a more reflective pool of patients (53). Ventricular
Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine | www.frontiersin.org 7 December 2020 | Volume 7 | Article 617451

Park et al. Cardiac Complications in Organic Acidemias
arrhythmias are particularly common in adolescents and young
adults with BTHS. Spencer et al. (54) reported a series
of 5 adolescent/young-adult BTHS patients with DCM and
lethal ventricular arrhythmias. One boy, of 11 years with
DCM, collapsed during play with cardiac arrest. Interestingly,
torsades de pointes (polymorphic ventricular tachycardia) was
documented for this patient. From his EKG, the corrected
QT interval (QTc) was 444 ms, which could be considered
as “borderline” elongated (55). He was managed with an
implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), and episodes of
short-lived ventricular tachycardia (VT) and VF were noted.
Multiple Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase
Deficiency (MADD; Glutaric Aciduria Type
II)
Metabolic Lesion and Presentation
Multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD; also
known as glutaric aciduria type II) is an inborn error of
fatty acid oxidation and amino acid (lysine and tryptophan)
catabolism. MADD can be caused by mutations in three genes:
ETFA and ETFB (encoding for electron-transfer flavoprotein,
ETF) and ETFDH (encoding for electron-transfer flavoprotein
dehydrogenase, ETFDH) (56). The clinical phenotype can vary,
but MADD patients can be broadly classified intro three groups
according to disease severity: (1) neonatal onset with congenital
anomalies; (2) neonatal onset without congenital anomalies;
(3) mild and/or later onset (57). Regardless of disease severity,
there will be some degree of glutaric acid accumulation in
fluid compartments, as well as increased concentrations of
medium- and long-chain acyl-carnitines. The neonatal onset
form is typically more severe, presenting with metabolic
acidosis, non-ketotic hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia and
cardiomyopathy (56).
Przyrembel et al. (58) were the first to describe MADD
(as glutaric aciduria type II) in a 2-hour-old neonate admitted
to hospital due to tachypnea of 80 breaths per minute. At
16 h of age, the patient was in compensated metabolic acidosis
with significant hypoglycemia. Despite glucose and sodium
bicarbonate infusion, the patient had cardiorespiratory arrest at
32 h of age. Although resuscitation was successful, the metabolic
acidosis and hypoglycemia persisted, leading to bradycardia and
hypothermia. At 70 h, severe metabolic acidosis became apparent
(blood pH 6.6), followed by cardiac arrest. Subsequent organic
acid profiling found abnormally large elevations of glutaric acid
in plasma and urine.
Associated Cardiac Defects
There are several reports describing cardiomyopathy in MADD
(59–61). The study by van Hove et al. (59) described three
patients with MADD, two of whom had cardiomyopathy,
who were phenotypically rescued with D,L-3-hydroxybutyrate
treatment. The authors postulated that the improvement was
attributable to increased energy bioavailability in the heart in the
form of ketone bodies (a source of energy that can be used by the
heart without need for fatty acid oxidation, which is normally the
energy source used by the heart).
CEREBRAL ORGANIC ACIDEMIAS
Type II D-2-Hydroxyglutaric Aciduria (Type
II D-2-HGA)
Metabolic Lesion and Presentation
2-hydroxyglutaric acid (2-HG) a five-carbon dicarboxylic acid,
and due to the chirality of the hydroxyl group on the second
carbon, it exists as enantiomeric dextro- (D) and levo (L) forms.
2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (2-HGA) is unique, in that different
enzymatic defects can result in the systemic accumulation of
D-2-HG, L-2-HG, or a combination of these, to result in three
distinct organic acidurias: L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (L-2-
HGA, caused by defects in the housekeeping enzyme L-2-
hydroxyglutaric dehydrogenase, L2HGDH); Type I and Type II
D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (Type I and Type II D-2-HGA,
see below for further details); combined D,L-2-hydroxyglutaric
aciduria (D,L-2-HGA). GC-MS or LC-MS/MS is required for
chiral differentiation during diagnosis (62).
It is remarkable that the simple chirality of 2-HG results
in some shared features, but also markedly distinct clinical
presentations. Both D-2-HGA and L-2-HGA patients typically
present with unexplained developmental delay and/or
neurological dysfunction (62). However, whilst L-2-HGA is
generally associated with neurological signs (e.g., intellectual
disability, motor developmental delay, extrapyramidal
symptoms), D-2-HGA, and specifically Type II D-2-HGA,
tends to present earlier in life with more severe symptoms (vs.
its Type I counterpart), and commonly manifests with DCM.
Although both types of D-2-HGA share the accumulation of
D-2-HG in physiological fluids, they have genetically distinct
defects. Type I D-2-HGA is caused by mutations in D2HGDH,
causing defects in D-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (63),
whereas Type II D-2-HGA, is caused by gain-of-function
mutations in IDH2 (encoding for isocitrate dehydrogenase
2) (64).
The first report of L-2-HGA was by Duran et al. (65). D2-HGA was described in the same year by Chalmers et al.
(66). Combined D,L-2-HGA was described several years later
by Muntau et al. (67). Combined D,L-2-HGA is caused by
impaired function of the mitochondrial citrate carrier (CIC)
due to pathogenic mutations in SLC25A1 (68), however cardiac
disease is not known to occur in D,L-2-HGA (69). D-2-HGA was
not recognized as a distinct neurometabolic disorder until the late
90’s. In the study by van der Knaap et al. (70), eight patients were
identified with D-2-HGA. In a recent article by Kranendijk et al.
(62), the authors included their own observations on 14 Type
I and 19 Type II D-2-HGA patients. In this cohort, no Type I
patient had cardiomyopathy. Of the 19 Type II patients, nine had
cardiomyopathy, with most of these being dilated.
Malonic Acidemia (MA)
Metabolic Lesion and Presentation
Malonic acidemia (MA) is a cerebral OA occurring as a result
of malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MCD) deficiency and is caused
by pathogenic variants in MLYCD (71). The disease phenotype
is variable, but patients typically present with developmental
delay, seizures, as well as cardiomyopathy. Laboratory findings
Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine | www.frontiersin.org 8 December 2020 | Volume 7 | Article 617451

Park et al. Cardiac Complications in Organic Acidemias
can include metabolic acidosis and hypoglycemia. Typical
biochemical abnormalities include significant accumulation of
malonyl-carnitine and malonic acid in physiological fluids, and
sometimes, combined elevations of malonic and methylmalonic
acids (72). Malonyl-CoA is unique in that it is an important
and dynamic regulator of fatty acid oxidation (FAO). At
high concentrations, it inhibits carnitine palmitoyl-transferase
1 (CPT1), an enzyme that mediates mitochondrial FAO by
converting acyl-CoAs into acyl-carnitines. Conversely, a fall in
malonyl-CoA activates CPT1, FAO, and specifically in hepatic
tissue, ketogenesis (73). It is especially important to maintain a
normal level of malonyl-CoA in the heart since it is an organ
primarily reliant on FAO as its primary fuel source (74); although
in certain specific pathological circumstances such as ischemiareperfusion injury, inhibiting FAO via malonyl-CoA is regarded
as being cardioprotective (75). In MA, there is some evidence to
suggest that cardiomyopathy can be improved by supplementing
the diet with medium-chain triglycerides, which can be converted
into ketone bodies by the liver and utilized by the heart as an
energy source (76).
Associated Cardiac Defects
Between 1984, when MA was first reported, and 2014, fewer than
30 cases have been described (77). The first case of MA was
described by Brown et al. (78) in a 5-year-old boy presenting
with short-stature, abdominal pain and vomiting. The first case
of cardiomyopathy was reported in a short communication by
Matalon et al. (79) in a 7-month-old boy who presented with mild
developmental delay and hypotonia. The infant had excessive
levels of urinary malonic, methylmalonic, and ethylmalonic
acids, accompanied by an abnormally high ratio of esterifiedto-free carnitine (>15-fold), with malonyl-CoA decarboxylase
determined as being ∼30% of normal wild-type activity. M-mode
echocardiography revealed LV dilatation (increased LV diastolic
dimension) and reduced contractile function, indicative of DCM.
Cardiac involvement is common in MA. In a case series of
8 new patients, heart disease (including cardiomyopathy, CHF,
mild LV hypertrophy) was reported in three patients, equivalent
to an incidence rate of 38% (71). Salomons et al. additionally
reviewed all 15 previously reported cases, which also had similar
incidence of cardiomyopathy (40%; 6/15). It is worth noting that
CHF due to HCM has also been reported in MA, in a 2-monthold boy presenting with severe tachypnea (80). Left chest lead Twave inversion and borderline QT interval prolongation was also
reported for this infant. Finally, more recently, mild LVNC has
been noted in a 1-year-old boy identified by newborn screening,
although his cardiac function was normal (81).
KETOLYTIC/KETOGENIC ORGANIC
ACIDEMIAS
3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl-CoA Lyase
(HMGCL) Deficiency
Metabolic Lesion and Presentation
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase (HMGCL) deficiency or
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric aciduria results from mutations in
the HMGCL genes, and is an OA affecting leucine metabolism.
HMGCL is also required for the synthesis of the ketone bodies
acetoacetate and 3-hydroxy-n-butyrate (82). HMGCL catalyzes
the last step in leucine catabolism involving the cleavage of 3-
hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA to acetoacetate and acetyl-CoA
(83). Patients typically present in the neonatal period with acute
metabolic decompensation and non-specific symptoms such as
vomiting and seizures. Key laboratory findings include metabolic
acidosis, raised anion gap, hypoglycemia, abnormal blood acylcarnitines, as well as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acid and its
derivatives in urine (84).
HMGCL deficiency was first described by Faull et al.
(85) in a 7 month-old neonate presenting with diarrhea,
vomiting, drowsiness and apnea. In this patient, initial laboratory
investigations showed metabolic acidosis and hypoglycemia. Out
of a total 211 cases of HMGCL deficiency identified and reviewed
in a recent meta-analysis by Grünert and Sass (82), cardiac
complications were reported in four cases. Grünert et al. (84)
reported DCM and cardiac arrest in one patient from a larger
case series of 37 patients.
Associated Cardiac Defects
The first case was fatal arrhythmia associated with
cardiomyopathy in a 7-month-old boy reported by Gibson
et al. (86). The child originally presented at 4 months of age with
vomiting, respiratory arrest, hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia
and metabolic acidosis. No cardiac abnormalities were present,
but at 7 months of age, he was re-hospitalized due to metabolic
decompensation and febrile upper respiratory illness. On
examination he had VT that rapidly progressed to VF, coincident
with poor LV function on echocardiography and cardiomegaly
on chest X-ray. The patient died 50 h after admission despite
aggressive resuscitation. There was no evidence of myocarditis,
but four-chamber dilatation and mild pulmonary edema was
noted on autopsy, indicative of DCM.
Leung et al. (87) reported a 23-year-old adult male with
HMGCL deficiency and acute HF secondary to DCM. The patient
was diagnosed with HMGCL deficiency at 9 months of age and
was managed conservatively with L-carnitine, and was largely
absent of symptoms. He presented at the age of 23 following a
2-month history of exertional dyspnea and progressive malaise.
Urinary organic acid analysis showed significant amounts of
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric and methylglutaconic acids. Brain
natriuretic peptide (BNP) was elevated indicative of myocardial
strain, although cardiac troponin I was undetectable, thus
excluding overt myocardial injury (88). EKG showed sinus
tachycardia and chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly. Further
investigation using CMR demonstrated poor ejection fraction
(EF; 15%), severe left-ventricular (LV) enlargement (significantly
raised LVEDV), severe right-ventricular dysfunction and bi-atrial
enlargement. The patient was diagnosed with HF secondary
to DCM.
Most often, IEMs and OAs are associated with
cardiomyopathy, which is typically dilated. However, Köksal
et al. (89) interestingly reported LVNC in an 8 month-old
boy with HMGCL deficiency. The patient presented with
vomiting, respiratory distress and tonic-clonic seizures.
Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine | www.frontiersin.org 9 December 2020 | Volume 7 | Article 617451

Park et al. Cardiac Complications in Organic Acidemias
Laboratory investigations showed metabolic acidosis,
hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, and raised urinary organic
acids characteristic of HMGCL deficiency. LVNC was revealed
upon echocardiography.
2-methylacetoacetyl-CoA Thiolase (MAT)
Deficiency (β-Ketothiolase)
Metabolic Lesion and Presentation
2-methylacetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (MAT; also known as βketothiolase, acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase, T2) deficiency results
from pathogenic variants in ACAT1, and is an organic aciduria
involving defects in ketone body metabolism (ketolysis) and
BCAA catabolism (90). MAT is involved in two metabolic
pathways: (1) isoleucine catabolism, where it cleaves 2-
methylacetoacetyl-CoA to propionyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA; (2)
utilization of ketone bodies (ketolysis), cleaving acetoacetylCoA to acetyl-CoA (91). MAT deficiency was first described
by Daum et al. (92) as β-ketothiolase deficiency in a 6-
year-old boy with severe metabolic acidosis and significant
concentrations of the organic acids α-methyl-β-hydroxybutyric
acid and α-methylacetoacetate in urine. Acetoacetate, which is
normally raised in MAT deficiency, was not commented upon in
this article.
Most patients typically present with a ketoacidotic crisis
between 6 and 36 months of age but are largely asymptomatic
between intermittent ketoacidoses. It can present clinically
similar to ketotic hypoglycaemia and succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid
CoA transferase (SCOT) deficiency (see next Section), thus
enzymatic diagnosis to confirm MAT deficiency is important
(90). In total, 244 patients have been identified and reported thus
far (91) but only one case had cardiac complications, an 8-yearold girl who died due to HF secondary to severe DCM (93).
Other Organic Acidemias With Reported
Cardiac Involvement
Other organic acidemias/acidurias that have reported cardiac
complications in a handful of patients, with little information, are
briefly mentioned in this section for completion.
Mevalonic aciduria is considered a cerebral organic acidemia
(3). It results from a deficiency in mevalonate kinase (involved in
the early steps of cholesterol biosynthesis), however a defect in
mevalonate kinase can also result in hyperimmunoglobulinemia
D syndrome. The typical biochemical finding is elevated
mevalonic acid and mevalonolactone (94). It was first described
by Hoffmann et al. (95) in a 2-year-old boy presenting with
severe failure-to-thrive, developmental delay and dysmorphic
features, with massive increases in both urinary and plasma
mevalonic acid. In a case series of 11 patients by Hoffmann et al.
(96), cardiomyopathy and heart block was identified in one of
these patients.
Succinyl-CoA:3-ketoacid CoA transferase (SCOT) catalyzes
the first, and rate-limiting step of ketone body utilization
(ketolysis) by activating acetoacetate to acetoacetyl-CoA;
acetoacetyl-CoA is then metabolized by acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase
into two acetyl-CoA molecules to enter the Krebs cycle (97).
SCOT deficiency is caused by pathogenic variants in OXCT1,
resulting in the inability of extra-hepatic organs to utilize ketone
bodies, and thus patients experience episodic ketoacidosis (98).
In a case series by Saudubray et al. (99), the authors claimed
that one patient (6 month-old boy) with SCOT deficiency had
cardiomegaly, although no other information was reported. It is
unlikely cardiac disease is a consistent observation in this disease.
Although not strictly an OA, succinyl-CoA ligase (SUCL)
deficiency is an IMD caused by mutations in SUCLA2 and
SUCLG1, and is associated with a methylmalonic aciduria (100).
SUCL catalyzes the conversion of succinyl-CoA and ADP or
GDP, to succinate and ATP or GTP. SUCLG1 is ubiquitously
expressed with the highest expression in heart, brain, kidney and
liver, and 14% of patients with SUCLG1 mutations from a large
case series of 71 patients presented with HCM (100).
CARDIAC DYSFUNCTION IN PROPIONIC
ACIDEMIA
Among the OAs, PA is most commonly associated with cardiac
disease. Further, it is one of the most frequent OAs, and therefore
has received a greater share of research interest from the scientific
community. A detailed description of cardiac dysfunction in PA
is therefore provided in this Section.
First Observations and Typical Clinical
Features of Heart Disease in PA
Heart disease in PA was first reported by Massoud and Leonard
(101) in a series of 19 pediatric patients. Six individuals had
evidence for cardiomyopathy, one of whom (Case 6) also
had a prolonged QT. This patient presented in the neonatal
period with metabolic acidosis, emesis and hypotonia. She
was diagnosed with PA at 3 days of age and managed
conservatively. At 4 years of age, the patient presented with
a 2-months history of breathlessness, skeletal myopathy and
cardiomyopathy. EKG findings included ST segment depression
and prolonged QT intervals (although duration was not
reported). On echocardiography, reduced contractile function
was noted, and after developing acute HF, the patient died.
As eluded to, cardiac complications account for significant
morbidity and mortality in PA patients, most commonly in
the form of cardiomyopathy and prolonged QT intervals (28,
102). Although HCM (103) and possibly LVNC (104) have been
reported, patients typically have DCM. In one of the largest case
series to date, cardiomyopathy had a prevalence rate of 23%
occurring in six out of 26 patients, all of whom had DCM, with a
mean age of the onset of 7 years (105).
More recently, a longitudinal observational monocentric
study of 18 PA patients spanning 28 years was published by
Kovacevic et al. (106). Here, patients were categorized into
“early” or “late-onset” (PA symptoms within 28 days, or after 28
days of life). Most patients (14/17; 82%) had an early-onset form
of PA, and cardiomyopathy was seen in 7 patients (7/18; 39%), all
of whom were from the early-onset cohort. Two of the patients
with cardiomyopathy (2/18; 11%) had DCM (LV dysfunction
and dilatation) whilst 5 patients (5/18; 28%) had hypokinetic
non-dilated cardiomyopathy (HNDC; LV dysfunction only).
Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine | www.frontiersin.org 10 December 2020 | Volume 7 | Article 617451

Park et al. Cardiac Complications in Organic Acidemias
QTc in these patients were on average normal (445 ± 18 ms).
Interestingly, there was no difference in QTc between earlyonset and late-onset patients, and no ventricular arrhythmias
were recorded in either group. Furthermore, longer QTc was
associated with a larger LV end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), and
critically, the number of metabolic decompensations per case
had no significant effect on either the onset of cardiomyopathy
or QTc duration. The latter point supports the idea that PAinduced cardiac dysfunction is uniquely due to propionate and
its metabolites, as opposed to an effect due to pH disturbances.
Interestingly, diastolic function was also assessed in the study
by Kovacevic et al. (106) using Doppler echocardiography. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first clinical study in PA
patients to evaluate diastolic function. Pulsed-wave Doppler was
used to measure the mitral E/A wave ratio, a marker determined
by the left atrial (LA)-LV pressure gradient during different
phases of diastole. A higher E/A is predictive of increased LV
filling pressure (which would impose greater diastolic wall stress,
“preload”). E-wave velocity (LA-LV pressure gradient in earlydiastole) is dependent on LV relaxation, whilst A-wave velocity
(LA-LV pressure gradient during late-diastole) is dependent on
LV stiffness and LA contractility (107). Kovacevic et al. found
evidence for diastolic dysfunction (based on E/A ratios) in 61%
(11/18) of their PA patient cohort, and diastolic dysfunction
typically preceded the cardiomyopathy seen in the seven patients
(7/18; 39%) in this study; four patients (4/18; 22%) had diastolic
dysfunction in the absence of any LV systolic dysfunction.
Despite the observations in the study by Kovacevic et al. (106),
prolongation of the QT interval is an established observation in
PA (28, 33, 108). In a large multi-center study of 55 pediatric and
adolescent PA patients from 16 European metabolic centers, 22%
of patients (12/55) had a prolonged QTc (108). No ventricular
arrhythmias were noted. Although, Grünert et al. comment that
only 38/55 patients of their cohort had an EKG documented,
and that in most cases, no stress-testing or Holter monitoring
was performed.
Baumgartner et al. (33) found a higher incidence of
prolonged QTc intervals in their longitudinal study of 10 PA
patients (median age of 9 years). Patients underwent cardiology
investigation including 12-lead EKG, 24-h Holter monitoring,
exercise-tolerance test (where possible) and echocardiography.
Prolonged QTc >440 ms was found in 70% (7/10) of patients,
with a markedly prolonged QTc >460 ms in 60% (6/10) of
patients. In this subset of patients, abnormal repolarization
was evident in the form of pre-terminal T-wave inversion
(which can be a sign of ventricular hypertrophy). Twenty
percent (2/10) of these children were found to have arrhythmic
events including sinus bradycardia, ventricular ectopic beats
(ventricular premature beats) and couplets (salvos). LV function
(LV FS) was reduced in 40% (4/10) of patients with prolonged
QTc, and one patient had DCM. Intriguingly, no correlation was
found between prolonged QTc and biochemical and metabolic
indices (pH, ammonia, amino acids, acyl-carnitines, etc.).
Although the arrhythmias documented by Baumgartner et al.
(33) were relatively innocuous, life-threatening arrhythmias
in conjunction with QT prolongation have indeed been
documented in PA. Jameson and Walter (109) reported successful
resuscitation following sudden cardiac arrest in a 13-year-old
girl who was diagnosed with PA shortly after birth whilst
playing netball. Her echocardiogram was normal with no
evidence of cardiomyopathy. However, 24-h Holster showed
QTc prolongation of 450 ms, which was confirmed on exercise
testing when QTc increased to ∼500 ms during the recovery
phase. The patient recovered well and was discharged with βblockade therapy. However, cardiac arrest in association with
cardiomyopathy in PA has also been described. Tan et al. (110)
reported a 25-year-old man confirmed with PA at 2 years of
age, who collapsed whilst jogging. Following cardiopulmonary
resuscitation, paramedics identified VF which was successfully
defibrillated. Initial investigation showed raised anion gap
metabolic acidosis and lactic acidemia, but normal cardiac
biomarkers and serum ammonia. QTc was normal (425 ms) and
was unchanged from previous clinic EKGs as part of routine PA
follow-up. However, post-arrest echocardiography showed LVEF
to be reduced (35%), which was a further decrease from 3 months
prior to cardiac arrest (49%).
Liver Transplantation in the Treatment of
PA-Induced Cardiomyopathy: Providing
Clues to Underlying Mechanisms
Although PA treatment is not a focus of this Review,
liver transplantation (LT) requires mentioning as it provides
insights into the potential mechanisms of PA-induced cardiac
dysfunction. For a more complete review of LT for the treatment
of cardiac disease in PA, we refer readers to a recent study by
Berry et al. (111). In brief, liver transplantation (LT) has been
proposed to be an effective way to treat PA by Leonard (112).
The liver is the major site for propionate metabolism (113). Since
PCC is expressed in all tissues of the body, LT is not expected to
be a metabolic cure, but rather to stabilize patients and minimize
decompensations. Indeed, LT has been shown to be effective in
improving clinical outcome in PA and to largely eliminate ketolactic-acidosis crises (114, 115). Intriguingly, there have been
several studies to suggest that LT can resolve cardiomyopathy
in PA, beginning with the seminal report by Romano et al.
(105), and indeed, LT is now considered a valid treatment for
cardiac disease in PA. More recently, however, Berry et al.
(111) reported a child whose cardiomyopathy had recurred
following LT. This child was diagnosed with PA at 5 months
and presented with signs of CHF at 9 years of age; subsequent
echocardiogram found DCM with reduced LV EF (20%), and
prolonged QTc (480 ms). These complications were successfully
managed with inotropes and diuretics and cardiac function
resolved. He received a successful LT at 10 years for other
clinical indications. However, at 14 years of age he presented with
cardiogenic shock and significantly elevated plasma propionylcarnitine, 2-methylcitrate and glycine. He died at 18 years with
pulmonary edema secondary to HF.
The pathogenesis of cardiomyopathy in PA is unclear. It
appears to be unrelated to metabolic crises, since LT successfully
reduces these episodes and improves overall outcomes. It should
be noted, however, that propionate metabolites can remain
elevated post-transplantation (111, 116). This leads to the

Park et al. Cardiac Complications in Organic Acidemias
credence that these “propionate metabolites” may be the key
drivers of cardiac pathogenesis (insights into the mechanisms
underlying cardiac dysfunction in PA from experimental
animal models).
Molecular Basis and Metabolic Signature
of PA
PA occurs due to defective propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC), a
biotin-dependent mitochondrial enzyme that normally catalyzes
the carboxylation of propionyl-CoA to D-methylmalonyl-CoA,
which eventually enters the Krebs cycle as succinyl-CoA
(Figure 2). This is an important reaction since propionate
is generated from various propiogenic substrates found in
normal diets, including branched-chain amino acids (isoleucine,
valine, methionine and threonine), odd-chain fatty acids and
cholesterol (29).
PCC is encoded by PCCA and PCCB and missense, nonsense,
and splicing mutations can occur in either of the genes (6). More
than 150 variant alleles in each gene have been reported [(117),
Human Gene Mutation Database Professional 2020.3 Release].
In both genes, missense mutations are predominant (∼50%)
and functional analyses have been used to identify functionally
“null” mutations associated with the most severe phenotypes,
as well as some hypomorphic alleles correlating with milder,
late onset presentations (118, 119). However, most patients
are compound heterozygotes, hindering the establishment of
genotype-phenotype correlations in most cases (102, 120).
Regardless of which mutation is involved, the ensuing defect
in PCC results in the accumulation of propionate and a myriad
of its metabolites, including propionyl-CoA, propionyl-carnitine,
3-hydroxypropionate and 2-methylcitrate. It is clear that the
accumulation of these substances is what is central to the
pathophysiology of PA, for several reasons: (1) PA patients
develop normally in utero, despite raised concentrations of
propionate metabolites (e.g., propionic acid, 2-methylcitrate),
and only develop symptoms following birth, as it is assumed
that propionic acid crossing into the maternal circulation will
be cleared by maternal hepatic PCC (121); (2) management of
PA is centered around reducing the propionate-load, through
dietary interventions and suppression of the gut flora; (3)
although LT has largely shown success in managing PA as
a “clinical syndrome,” propionate metabolites remain elevated
post-transplant and recurrence of cardiomyopathy has been
reported (see preceding Section); (4) despite being closely related
biochemically, cardiac complications are far more common in
PA compared to MMA, where there is less accumulation of
propionate metabolites. Therefore, the question remains, which
of these propionate metabolites are involved in the pathological
remodeling of the heart, and why does it happen?
Insights Into the Mechanisms Underlying
Cardiac Dysfunction in PA From
Experimental Animal Models
PA is a complex, heterogeneous disease, affecting multiple organ
systems and cellular pathways. It is therefore unlikely that a
single mechanism is responsible for driving the heart disease in
these patients (Figure 3). Whereas, the cardiomyopathy seems
to appear mainly during childhood (mean onset age 7 years)
(105), the long QT syndrome observed in PA has been shown
to be progressive with age. The available evidence suggests that
the DCM and prolonged QT are a secondary consequence of
PCC dysfunction.
Here, we review the pathogenic mechanisms proposed to
underpin cardiac dysfunction in PA. This knowledge-base has
largely been borne from laboratory studies, exploiting a variety of
experimental models. Broadly, two general “systems” have been
used in studying cardiac dysfunction in PA: (1) in vitro systems,
using patient-derived cells, immortalized cell lines, or primary
rodent cells (which may or may not have been exogenously
treated with propionate metabolites); (2) Pcca−−/− (A138T)
mice, an in vivo mouse model of PA generated by Dr. Michael
Barry (Mayo Clinic, US). Since this mouse model has been
utilized by numerous studies, it will be briefly described here.
Pcca−/− (A138T) mice are estimated to have ∼2% PCC
activity as measured by a radiometric activity assay in liver
homogenates (122). This residual level of activity results in the
necessary minimum clearance of propiogenic substrates to allow
these animals to survive to adulthood. Guenzel et al. (122)
found these animals to present with a mild-to-moderate PA
phenotype and have raised plasma markers characteristic of PA
such as propionyl-carnitine and 2-methylcitrate. Furthermore,
these animals have raised Nppb in their hearts, which encodes
for the hormone brain-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), a
classical biomarker released during hemodynamic stress (when
ventricles are dilated, hypertrophic, or subjected to increased wall
tension) (123).
Mitochondrial Dysfunction: Energetic Deficiency,
Oxidative Stress, and Metabolic Dysfunction
The heart is a highly energy-demanding organ, with an
average adult human heart consuming ∼6 kg of ATP per
day, despite only having enough stored for a few heartbeats.
Thus, perhaps not surprisingly, mitochondrial dysfunction has
been implicated as a major driver of pathological cardiac
remodeling in cardiomyopathy (124). Although decreased
energy supply is considered as the main consequence of
mitochondrial dysfunction, recent advances have shown that
it contributes to the pathogenesis of HF, beyond the idea of
simply inadequate energy provision (125). Available evidence
suggests mitochondrial dysfunction is an underlying etiological
factor contributing to cardiomyopathy in PA in the form
of ultrastructural changes, electron transport chain (ETC)
deficiency, oxidative stress, and metabolic dysfunction (6,
102).
The accumulation of propionate metabolites can impair or
interfere with mitochondrial biochemical pathways. PropionylCoA has been shown in vitro to be a major mitochondrial
toxin in PA and to impair oxidative phosphorylation through
the synergistic inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex,
α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, and ETC Complex III
(126). Deficiencies in ETC Complex I (103) and ETC Complexes
III/IV (127) have also been detected in the hearts of PA patients.

Park et al. Cardiac Complications in Organic Acidemias
FIGURE 3 | Overview of the potential mechanisms that may contribute to cardiac dysfunction in PA. The available evidence suggests that cardiac dysfunction in PA is
driven by the toxic accumulation of metabolites, secondary to defective propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC). Multiple mechanisms have been identified, which are likely
to be interrelated and acting in tandem. HDAC, histone deacetylase; miRNA, microRNA; mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; PA, propionic acidemia.
Baruteau et al. (128) presented a PA patient with severe DCM
who was found to have enlarged mitochondria, atypical cristae,
reduced Complex IV activity, as well as markedly reduced
coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinone) on myocardial biopsy. Interestingly,
the DCM improved with ubiquinone supplementation, which
may be related to positive effects from reducing oxidative stress
(see next).
There is a wealth of literature supporting that oxidative stress
has a detrimental effect on the heart, including pathological
remodeling, fibrosis, and contractile dysfunction (129). The
redox state in the heart is balanced by sources of reactive
oxygen species (e.g., mitochondrial electron transport, NADPH
oxidases, uncoupled nitric oxide synthase) and intrinsic
antioxidants/antioxidant systems (e.g., ubiquinone, vitamin C,
superoxide dismutase) (129). Since oxidative phosphorylation
is inhibited in PA, a redox imbalance and increased oxidative
stress are predicted for PA hearts. Indeed, oxidative stress has
been implicated as an important mechanism involved in the
pathophysiology of PA (30), which is likely to be involved
in PA-induced cardiac dysfunction. Increased intracellular
hydrogen peroxide has been detected in PA patient fibroblasts,
indicating increased oxidative stress is apparent in PA (130).
In experimental studies, increased superoxide production has
been shown in the hearts of Pcca−/− (A138T) mice (131).
In a subsequent study, treatment of Pcca−/− (A138T) mice
with antioxidants was found to normalize the increase in
expression of Nppb mRNA (BNP) in the heart (132). The
relevance of oxidative stress as a mechanism contributing to
cardiomyopathy is supported by the clinical experience of
ubiquinone supplementation improving DCM, as described in
the previous paragraph.
The heart relies on FAO as its primary substrate for ATP
production. However, it also displays a remarkable ability to
utilize different substrates, including ketone bodies and amino
acids, with a so-called “metabolic flexibility” (133). Despite
this flexibility, a hallmark of pathological hypertrophy and HF
is a “switch” in substrate-dependence from fatty acids toward
glucose and ketone bodies (124, 134). Using an isotope-based
metabolic flux approach in Langendorff-perfused rat hearts,
Wang et al. (135) found that the perfusion of propionate
led to an accumulation of propionyl-CoA. This accumulation
caused significant mitochondrial CoA trapping and altered
pool sizes of Krebs cycle intermediates. FAO was inhibited,
with a concomitant increase in glucose oxidation (despite
Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine | www.frontiersin.org 13 December 2020 | Volume 7 | Article 617451

Park et al. Cardiac Complications in Organic Acidemias
glycolysis being unchanged). Interestingly, supplementing the
hearts with L-carnitine did not relieve the CoA trapping
or reverse the fuel-switch mediated by propionate, because
the authors showed that the heart lacks the specific enzyme
that catalyzes this reaction. Thus, there is good evidence for
metabolic dysfunction contributing toward cardiac dysfunction
in PA. Furthermore, this hindering of cardiac energy metabolism
is likely to be exacerbated by 2-methylcitrate, a commonly
elevated metabolite in PA, formed from propionyl-CoA, which
has been shown to act as an inhibitor of Krebs cycle
enzymes (136).
MicroRNAs
Whilst only 3% of the human genome codes for proteins, the
remainder is still extensively transcribed, producing long noncoding RNAs (>200 nucleotides) and microRNAs (miRNAs;
∼22 nucleotides), which are recognized to play important roles
in transcriptional regulation (137). miRNAs are short, noncoding, single-stranded RNAs that anneal with complementary
mRNA sequences to suppress protein expression. There are
a plethora of miRNAs that have been discovered which have
been implicated as key players in the pathophysiology of heart
disease, and are uniquely detected in different cardiac pathologies
like arrhythmia, cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure (138).
For example, Wahlquist et al. (139) showed 15 miRNAs to be
uniquely upregulated in a mouse model of HF. Interestingly,
miRNA-25 was found to reduce expression of SERCA, a key
cardiac protein important in excitation-contraction coupling
(see excitation-contraction coupling). Perhaps more importantly,
anti-miRNA-25 therapy was found to restore cardiac function
in these failing mice, along with reduction of fibrosis and
normalization of cardiomyocyte size.
Dysregulated miRNAs have also been detected in a range
of tissues (e.g., brain, liver) in Pcca−/− (A138T) mice (140).
More recently, Fulgencio-Covian et al. (141) performed analysis
of cardiac-enriched miRNAs in a cohort of PA patient plasma
and in two experimental models: (1) the hearts of Pcca−/−
(A138T) mice, and (2) propionate treatment in HL-1 cells, an
immortalized atrial cell line. The authors found a significant
upregulation of several miRNAs involved in cardiac pathology in
Pcca−/− (A138T) mouse hearts, for example miRNA-22 which
has been implicated in cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis that acts
via the PI3K/AKT pathway. To support the relevance of these
findings, Fulgencio-Covian et al. found upregulation of several
genes involved in the PI3K/AKT pathway that are important for
the heart (e.g., Fos, Jun). Finally, experiments were performed
on HL-1 cells treated with propionate, which confirmed the
upregulation of several miRNAs increased in PA mice, providing
evidence that propionate is a toxic metabolite in PA.
Histone Acetylation and Propionylation
DCM is frequently inherited through mutations in the “classical
DCM genes” such as TTN (titin) and LMNA (lamin A/C) (142).
Although the evidence to-date shows that cardiomyopathy in
PA can occur without a change in expression of the DCM
genes, the possibility exists that PA acts as a modifier of an
“unknown” DCM-related gene, or of genes critical to normal
cardiac function (143). Post-translational modification of histone
proteins, in the form of acylation, is a major mechanism of
regulating gene expression, and epigenetic alternations in cardiac
gene expression programs are known to be involved in adverse
cardiac remodeling (144). It is established that acetyl-CoA is not
the only metabolite that can participate in this process, but rather
a plethora of metabolites such as butyryl-CoA, succinyl-CoA and
notably, propionyl-CoA (145).
There are two pathways implicated as potential mechanisms
in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression in PA: (1)
the inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs) by propionate,
promoting histone acetylation, which is known to be involved
in pathological cardiac remodeling (146); (2) propionyl-CoA
acting as a false-substrate for histone acetyltransferases (HATs)
to result in histone propionylation. Butyrate (C4) is a wellestablished, potent inhibitor of HDACs, and propionate (C3)
has shown to also have HDAC inhibition properties (147). It
would be expected that the accumulation of propionate in PA
would result in HDAC inhibition and an increase in histone
acetylation. Histone 3 propionylation at lysine 14 (H3K14pr)
has recently shown to be a modification that is a signature of
transcriptionally active chromatin. The study by Kebede et al.
(148) showed that H3K14pr is present in the liver of Pcca−/−
(A138T) mice and that it is mediated in vivo by HATs (GCN5
and PCAF). They also showed that H3K14pr levels return to
baseline wild-type levels in those mice that underwent PCCA
gene therapy.
Ion Channel Function and the Cardiac Action
Potential
Prolongation of the QT interval, as seen in long QT-syndrome
(LQTS), is a major pro-arrhythmic substrate that can precipitate
in sudden cardiac death due to VF and torsades de pointes (149).
LQTS can be both acquired (e.g., drug-induced, cardiomyopathyinduced) and inherited (due to mutations in genes, e.g.,
KCNQ1, KCNH2) (150). Thus, whilst the small possibility
exists that PA patients carry mutations in genes encoding for
both PCC (i.e., PA) and ion channel subunits (i.e., congenital
LQTS), this has never been reported, and indeed, whole-exome
sequencing is frequently employed during IMD diagnosis (2,
119). Furthermore, as Baumgartner et al. (33) pointed out,
mutations in ion channel subunits are unlikely to be the
cause of LQTS in PA patients, since QT prolongation was not
permanently present in PA, and because prolongation of the
QT appeared to worsen with age as a progressive process (vs.
congenital LQTS, which typically presents at birth) (see first
observations and typical clinical features of heart disease in PA).
Therefore, LQTS in PA is most likely to be the acquired form,
due to cardiomyopathy, and/or, the toxic effect of propionate
metabolites. Although, it should be noted that Baumgartner
et al. (33) found no correlation between prolonged QTc and
biochemical and metabolic indices (pH, ammonia, amino acids,
acyl-carnitines, etc.).
QT intervals recorded on surface EKGs are ultimately a
manifestation of the ventricular action potential (AP). Since
Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine | www.frontiersin.org 14 December 2020 | Volume 7 | Article 617451

Park et al. Cardiac Complications in Organic Acidemias
LQTS can be caused by a defect in a variety of currents
underlying the AP (primarily IKr and IKs), direct examination
of these currents by electrophysiology is required to identify
the underlying ionic mechanism (and therapeutic target). Bodi
et al. (151) interrogated the pathophysiology of LQTS in PA
using electrophysiology. Their study investigated the acute and
chronic effects of various propionate metabolites (propionic
acid, propionyl-carnitine and 2-methylcitrate) on IKr (KCNH2)
and IKs (KCNQ1), the most important repolarizing currents.
Although IKr gating properties were found to be affected by
propionate metabolites, the main effects were found to be on
IKs. Acute application of propionate metabolites significantly
decreased IKs current densities (tail and end-pulse currents),
and these effects were reversible (upon washout). The effect
of a chronic application of propionate metabolites on protein
expression found KCNQ1 to be reduced, but only by propionylcarnitine and 2-methylcitrate (propionic acid paradoxically
increased KCNQ1 expression, although this had no effect on IKs
current density). Finally, propionic acid significantly prolonged
AP duration (APD) in human-induced pluripotent stem cellderived cardiomyocytes, but not in KCNQ1-deficient rabbits
lacking IKs. Collectively, their results suggested a reduction of IKs
may account for the observed APD prolongation and QT interval
prolongation in PA.
Excitation-Contraction Coupling
Cardiac excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling is the process by
which mechanical contraction is triggered by an electric stimulus.
Cardiomyocyte Ca2+ handling and E-C coupling frequently
becomes dysregulated in a number cardiac pathologies, including
cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia (152, 153). Following an AP,
depolarization of the myocyte causes Ca2+ entry via voltagegated L-type Ca2+ channels as an inward current (ICa,L). This
Ca2+ entry triggers a much larger release of Ca2+ from the
myocyte’s intracellular Ca2+ store, the sarcoplasmic reticulum
(SR), via ryanodine receptor release channels in a process termed
Ca2+-induced Ca2+-release (154). Contraction is triggered by
the rise in free intracellular [Ca2+], causing Ca2+ to bind to
troponin C on the myofilament and promoting cross-bridge
formation (88). Relaxation occurs through removal of Ca2+ from
the cytoplasm through a combination of (1) Ca2+ being pumped
back into the SR by the SR-Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA), and (2) Ca2+
extrusion out the cell by Na+/Ca2+-exchange (NCX) (153).
Identifying which E-C coupling protein is defective for
a given pathology is important for therapeutic strategies.
Only one study has been published to-date interrogating
E-C coupling in PA. Tamayo et al. (7) performed Ca2+
imaging on ventricular myocytes isolated from Pcca−/− (A138T)
mice. Compared to wild-type controls, they found electricallyevoked Ca2+ transients were smaller, and took longer to
recover, indicative of reduced SERCA activity. NCX activity
was found to be unchanged (probed from the caffeineevoked Ca2+ transient). Although SERCA protein expression
was unchanged, SERCA pump activity (assayed by ATP
hydrolysis) was reduced, which the authors attributed to reduced
energy metabolism (that is typical in PA), and oxidation of
SERCA (secondary to increased ROS in these myocytes). Since
reduced SERCA function is a hallmark of cardiomyopathy
(152) and aberrant Ca2+ handling increases the propensities
for arrhythmias (155), remodeled E-C coupling could be
another mechanism contributing to adverse cardiac function
in PA.
CONCLUSIONS
Genotypically, organic acidemias could be considered as “simple”
enzymatic lesions, but their phenotypic presentation can be very
complex, highlighting the breadth of actions of the metabolites
associated with the defect. Cardiac dysfunction is a common
complication in several OAs, including Barth syndrome and
propionic acidemia. However, the mechanistic basis underlying
this dysfunction has yet to be fully elucidated, both owing to the
complexity and rarity of these diseases.
There has been a growing interest in the biology of propionate
and in the research effort to understand the mechanisms
underlying gross organ dysfunction in PA, particularly in
the past decade. Although it is theoretically possible that
PA patients have congenital defects in PCC and in proteins
that are typically mutated in DCM or LQTS, this is highly
unlikely. Rather, available evidence suggests that these cardiac
pathologies are driven by the accumulation of toxic metabolites,
including propionate, propionyl-CoA and 2-methylcitrate. There
are multiple mechanisms that have been identified, including
mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress and changes in
gene expression. However, it is unlikely that there is a single
mechanism acting in isolation. A greater understanding of these
processes and identifying the molecular targets in the hearts of
PA patients will help in formulating better therapeutic strategies
for the future.
