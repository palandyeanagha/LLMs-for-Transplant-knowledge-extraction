Fungal bloodstream infections are associated with significant patient mortality and health care costs.
Nevertheless, the relationship between a delay of the initial empiric antifungal treatment until blood culture
results are known and the clinical outcome is not well established. A retrospective cohort analysis with
automated patient medical records and the pharmacy database at Barnes-Jewish Hospital was conducted. One
hundred fifty-seven patients with a Candida bloodstream infection were identified over a 4-year period (January
2001 through December 2004). Fifty (31.8%) patients died during hospitalization. One hundred thirty-four
patients had empiric antifungal treatment begun after the results of fungal cultures were known. From the time
that the first blood sample for culture that was positive was drawn, 9 (5.7%) patients received antifungal
treatment within 12 h, 10 (6.4%) patients received antifungal treatment between 12 and 24 h, 86 (54.8%)
patients received antifungal treatment between 24 and 48 h, and 52 (33.1%) patients received antifungal
treatment after 48 h. Multiple logistic regression analysis identified Acute Physiology and Chronic Health
Evaluation II scores (one-point increments) (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI],
1.18 to 1.31; P < 0.001), prior antibiotic treatment (AOR, 4.05; 95% CI, 2.14 to 7.65; P  0.028), and
administration of antifungal treatment 12 h after having the first positive blood sample for culture (AOR, 2.09;
95% CI, 1.53 to 2.84; P  0.018) as independent determinants of hospital mortality. Administration of empiric
antifungal treatment 12 h after a positive blood sample for culture is drawn is common among patients with
Candida bloodstream infections and is associated with greater hospital mortality. Delayed treatment of Candida
bloodstream infections could be minimized by the development of more rapid diagnostic techniques for the
identification of Candida bloodstream infections. Alternatively, increased use of empiric antifungal treatment
in selected patients at high risk for fungal bloodstream infection could also reduce delays in treatment.
Nosocomial bloodstream infections are serious infections
associated with significant mortality and health care costs (39).
Fungal bloodstream infections, primarily those caused by Candida species, are now the fourth most common bloodstream
infection in the United States (21, 29, 30, 42). Risk factors for
the development of Candida bloodstream infection are well
recognized and include previous administration of antimicrobial agents (4, 33, 40), corticosteroids (14, 16), or chemotherapeutic agents (14, 16, 34); hematologic or solid-organ malignancy (16); neutropenia (14, 41); extensive intra-abdominal
surgery or burns (3, 14, 16); mechanical ventilation or admission to an intensive care unit (2, 4, 25, 28, 33, 37); indwelling
central venous catheter or parenteral nutrition (2–4, 14, 16,
40); hemodialysis (40); and prior fungal colonization (4, 14, 28,
37, 40, 41). More recently, there has been an increase in the
number of non-Candida albicans Candida species associated
with bloodstream infection (1, 36). Prior patient exposure to
antifungal therapy, particularly with fluconazole, appears to be
a predictor for bloodstream infection with non-C. albicans
Candida species (9, 29, 35).
Appropriate initial antimicrobial therapy has been shown to
be an important predictor of outcome for patients with microbiologically confirmed nosocomial infections, including bloodstream infections and severe sepsis (8–13, 17–20). One group
of investigators has been able to demonstrate a significant
relationship between the percentage of inappropriate initial
antimicrobial treatment administered for the treatment of nosocomial bloodstream infections caused by specific pathogens,
including Candida species, and overall hospital mortality (12).
Unfortunately, most prior studies of Candida bloodstream infection have not specifically evaluated the role of delayed appropriate antimicrobial therapy on clinical outcomes.
Due to the overall importance of bloodstream infections
attributed to Candida species, we performed a retrospective
cohort analysis with two main goals. First, we wanted to identify the prevalence of the delay of empiric antifungal treatment
for patients with a Candida bloodstream infection until after
the results of blood cultures were known. Our second goal was
to determine whether the delay of the administration of antifungal treatment until the results of blood cultures were known
influenced the clinical outcomes in patients with Candida
bloodstream infections.

Study design and data collection. A retrospective cohort study design was
employed, with the main outcome measure being hospital mortality. We also
assessed secondary outcomes, including microbiologic clearance of the infection,
the duration of hospitalization, and the length of stay in the intensive care unit.
For all study patients, the following characteristics were recorded by one of the
investigators (M.M.): age, gender, the presence of underlying malignancy, neutropenia, seropositivity for the human immunodeficiency virus antibody, diabetes
mellitus, bone marrow or solid-organ transplant, abdominal or cardiothoracic
surgery, and hypotension. These characteristics were determined at the time that
the initial blood sample that was obtained for culture and from which a fungal
pathogen was isolated was drawn. The white blood cell count, body temperature,
and serum creatinine level were also assessed at the time that the initial positive
blood samples for culture were collected and 72 h later. The severity of illness,
based on Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores
(15), was calculated on the basis of clinical data available from the first 24-h
period following identification of a positive blood culture result. The specific
processes of medical care examined during the patients’ hospital stays included
mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure, the administration of vasopressors
for circulatory shock, the presence of a central venous catheter and its duration
of use prior to having a positive blood culture, the administration of parenteral
nutrition, prior antimicrobial administration, prior antifungal therapy, and the
number of ventilator days and intensive care unit days before the positive blood
sample for culture was drawn. Variables describing the fungal bloodstream
infection and their treatment were also assessed. All patient-level data were
recorded from automated patient medical records (EMTEK Health Care Systems Inc., Tempe, AZ, and Clinical Desktop, BJC Healthcare, St. Louis, MO)
and the Barnes-Jewish Hospital Pharmacy automated database, all of which
contain prospectively entered information.
A computerized list of patients with a positive Candida blood culture was
generated by the Microbiology Laboratory at Barnes-Jewish Hospital, which
allowed identification of potential study patients. Patients could be entered into
the study only once.
Definitions. All definitions were selected prospectively as part of the original
study design. The timing of administration of antifungal therapy was determined
as the interval between the time when the first Candida-positive blood sample for
culture was drawn and the time when antifungal treatment was first administered
to the patient. We segregated these times as being less than 12 h, 12 to 24 h, 24
to 48 h, or greater than 48 h.
The antimicrobial guideline employed for the empiric treatment of suspected
nosocomial bloodstream infections at Barnes-Jewish Hospital recommends initial treatment with a combination of an antistaphylococcal drug (vancomycin for
methicillin-resistant staphylococci) and at least one antibiotic, usually a betalactam, with activity against gram-negative bacteria (24). For patients at increased risk for infection with antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteria (e.g.,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species), two antibiotics directed
against gram-negative bacteria are initially recommended (an antipseudomonal
beta-lactam or a carbapenem in combination with an aminoglycoside or a fluoroquinolone). The addition of empiric antifungal therapy is left to the discretion
of the treating physicians, but treatment is recommended for high-risk patients
(e.g., patients with prolonged neutropenia, prior antimicrobial exposure, or
bowel perforation or patients receiving parenteral nutrition). The antibiotic
guideline also recommends modification of the initially prescribed empiric antimicrobial regimens based on the results of clinical cultures and the antimicrobial
susceptibilities of the pathogens identified. Deescalation or narrowing of the
initial empirically prescribed antimicrobial regimens was routinely monitored by
hospital pharmacists and had to be approved by the patient’s primary physician
team (13, 24).
For the purposes of this investigation, inappropriate antimicrobial treatment
of a fungal bloodstream infection was defined as the microbiologic documentation of infection (i.e., a positive fungal blood culture result) that was not being
effectively treated at the time that the causative microorganism was identified
(12, 17, 19). Inappropriate antimicrobial treatment could occur due to omission
of antifungal treatment or administration of an antifungal drug to which the
fungal isolate was likely to be resistant. The microbiology laboratory at BarnesJewish Hospital does not perform routine antimicrobial susceptibility testing of
fungal isolates. The use of fluconazole was assumed to be inappropriate if it was
prescribed for fungal bloodstream infections caused by Candida krusei (9, 27, 35).
Hypotension was defined as mean arterial pressures lower than 55 mm Hg for
at least 1 h, despite adequate fluid replacement and treatment with more than 5
g/kg of body weight of dopamine or current treatment with epinephrine or
norepinephrine (26). Additionally, urinary output of less than 0.5 ml/kg of body
weight for at least 1 h was required as a definition of circulatory shock. Respiratory failure was defined as the need for mechanical ventilation applied either
by an endotracheal tube or by a mask. The number of central vein catheter days
prior to fungal bloodstream infection included the time from when the catheter
was first placed, even if this preceded the current hospitalization.
Blood culture technique. Blood samples for culture were obtained from two
peripheral sites by nurses or hospital-trained phlebotomists. Before collection of
the blood samples, the skin was disinfected with 70% isopropyl alcohol, followed
by 2% iodine tincture. The antecubital fossae were the preferred sampling sites,
and sterile needles and syringes were used. When only one peripheral site was
available and the patient had a central vein catheter in place, the second blood
culture sample was obtained from the central vein catheter. Injection of 5 ml or
less of blood into a blood culture bottle was not permitted to avoid false-negative
results (38). All blood samples were inoculated into aerobic media and processed
by using the BACTEC blood culture system (Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD).
BACTEC fungal medium bottles were available but had to be specifically requested by the physician ordering the blood cultures.
Statistical analysis. All comparisons were unpaired, and all tests of significance were two tailed. Continuous variables were compared by the Student t test
for normally distributed variables and the Mann-Whitney U test for nonnormally
distributed variables. The chi-square or Fisher’s exact test was used to compare
categorical variables. The primary data analysis compared hospital nonsurvivors
with survivors. Values are expressed as the means  standard deviations (continuous variables) or as a percentage of the group from which they were derived
(categorical variables). All P values were two tailed, and P values of 0.05 or less
were considered to indicate statistical significance.
We performed multiple logistic regression analysis using SPSS, version 11.0 for
Windows (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). Multivariable analysis was performed by
using models that were judged a priori to be clinically sound (5). This was
prospectively determined to be necessary to avoid the production of spuriously
significant results with multiple comparisons. All potential risk factors significant
at the 0.2 level were entered into the model. A stepwise approach was used to
enter new terms into the logistic regression model, where hospital mortality was
the dependent outcome variable, and 0.05 was set as the limit for the acceptance
or removal of new terms.
RESULTS
Patients. A total of 157 consecutive patients with Candida
bloodstream infections were evaluated. No patient with a Candida bloodstream infection was excluded from evaluation during this study period. The mean age of the patients was 56.0 
16.7 years (range, 19 to 97 years), and the mean APACHE II
score was 13.9  5.7 (range, 3 to 29). There were 79 (50.3%)
men and 78 (49.7%) women; 34 (21.7%) patients were neutropenic, 36 (22.9%) had undergone either abdominal or cardiothoracic surgery, 31 (19.7%) had received an organ transplant, and 83 (52.9%) had an underlying malignancy (Table 1).
Patient characteristics according to hospital mortality. Fifty
(31.8%) patients died during hospitalization. The 30-day mortality rate for this cohort of hospitalized patients was also
31.8%. Hospital nonsurvivors were statistically more likely
than hospital survivors to have neutropenia, hypotension, and
lower body temperature at the time that the initial positive
blood samples for cultures were drawn; greater APACHE II
scores; and higher serum creatinine values when positive blood
samples for culture were initially drawn and 72 h later (Table
1). Additionally, hospital nonsurvivors more often required
vasopressors, had more days on mechanical ventilation, and
longer intensive care unit lengths of stay prior to the identification of a positive Candida blood culture than survivors (Table 2).
Fungal isolates and antimicrobial treatment characteristics.
Candida albicans was the most common fungal isolate recovered from the blood cultures (Table 3). Six (3.8%) patients had
two fungal species isolated from their blood cultures. Hospital

mortality was similar for patients with Candida albicans isolated from a blood culture and patients with non-Candida
albicans species isolated from a blood culture (28.6% versus
35.6%; P  0.345). Only five patients were treated with appropriate antifungal therapy at the time that the blood samples for
culture were collected. One hundred thirty-four patients had
empiric antifungal treatment started after the results of the
fungal cultures were known. Among these 134 patients, 4 received empiric treatment with an agent to which the fungal
isolate was presumed to be resistant.
From the time that a positive blood sample for culture was
drawn, 9 (5.7%) patients received antifungal treatment within
12 h, 10 (6.4%) patients received antifungal treatment between
12 and 24 h, 86 (54.8%) patients received antifungal treatment
between 24 and 48 h, and 52 (33.1%) patients received antifungal treatment after 48 h. The relationship between hospital
mortality and the timing of the administration of antifungal
treatment is shown in Fig. 1. Patients receiving antifungal
treatment within 12 h of having a positive blood sample for
culture drawn had a lower, but not statistically significantly
different, risk of hospital mortality than patients begun on
antifungal treatment after 12 h (11.1% versus 33.1%; P 
0.169). When the patients were stratified by severity of illness,
patients receiving antifungal treatment within 12 h of having a
positive blood sample for culture drawn also had a lower risk
FIG. 1. Relationship between hospital mortality and the timing of
antifungal treatment. The timing of antifungal therapy was determined
to be from the time when the first blood sample for culture positive for
fungi was drawn to the time when antifungal treatment was first administered to the patient.

of mortality than patients begun on antifungal treatment after
12 h for patients with APACHE II scores less than or equal to
15 (n  90) (0.0% versus 23.5%; P  0.583) and for patients
with APACHE II scores greater than 15 (n  67) (25.0%
versus 46.0%; P  0.622).
Twenty-three (14.6%) patients received at least one dose of
empiric appropriate antifungal treatment prior to notification
of a positive Candida blood culture result. The hospital mortality rate for these patients was lower, but not statistically
significantly different, than those for patients receiving appropriate antifungal treatment after notification of a positive
blood culture result (21.7% versus 33.6%; P  0.260). There
was no statistical difference in APACHE II scores between
patients receiving at least one dose of empiric appropriate
antifungal treatment prior to notification of a positive Candida
blood culture result and patients receiving appropriate antifungal treatment after notification of a positive blood culture
result (14.9  5.6 versus 13.8  5.7; P  0.375).
A similar analysis was conducted for the patients identified
as having Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis, or Candida
tropicalis isolated from their blood cultures (n  130). This was
done, as these isolates are generally susceptible to fluconazole,
eliminating the potential influence of fluconazole resistance in
other strains of Candida. The hospital mortality was again
found to be lower for patients receiving antifungal treatment
within 12 h of having a positive blood sample for culture drawn
(14.3% versus 31.7%; P  0.437).
Multivariable analysis. Multiple logistic regression analysis
identified increasing APACHE II scores (one-point increments), prior antibiotic treatment, and administration of antifungal treatment after 12 h of having the first positive blood
sample for culture drawn as independent determinants of hospital mortality (Table 4). All other combinations of variables
entered into the logistic regression analysis yielded a final
model with administration of antifungal treatment after 12 h of
having the first positive blood sample for culture drawn as an
independent determinant of hospital mortality.
Secondary outcomes. Among the hospital nonsurvivors, the
causes of death included sepsis and multiorgan failure not
directly attributed to Candida infection (n  31), sepsis and
multiorgan failure directly attributed to Candida infection (n 
11), cardiac arrest (n  6), and pulmonary embolism (n  2).
Patients receiving empiric antifungal treatment within 12 h of
having blood samples for culture drawn had statistically shorter
durations of mechanical ventilation and intensive care than
patients receiving empiric antifungal treatment after 12 h of
having blood samples for culture drawn. Hospital nonsurvivors
had statistically longer durations of mechanical ventilation and
intensive care unit lengths of stay (Table 5). Microbiologic
clearance of the fungal pathogens and the overall duration of
hospitalization did not differ between the survivors and the
nonsurvivors. There were no statistically significant differences
in any of the secondary outcome variables between patients
infected with Candida albicans and patients infected with
non-C. albicans Candida species. Among the 139 patients with
a central vein catheter in place at the time that a positive blood
sample for culture for Candida was drawn, the catheters were
removed from 106 (76.3%) patients within 48 h of reporting of
the positive blood culture result.
DISCUSSION
Our study demonstrated that initial empiric treatment of
fungal bloodstream infection after 12 h of having the first
positive blood sample for culture drawn is common and is
associated with a greater risk of hospital mortality than treatment with appropriate antifungal agents within 12 h of having
a positive blood sample for culture drawn. Multiple logistic
regression analysis identified administration of antifungal therapy after 12 h of having the first positive blood sample for
culture drawn as an independent predictor of hospital mortality. Additionally, our analysis showed that prior antimicrobial
exposure and greater APACHE II scores were independently
associated with hospital mortality.
Previous investigations have demonstrated that antimicrobial regimens lacking activity against the microorganisms that
have been identified and that are causing serious infections
(e.g., hospital-acquired pneumonia and bloodstream infections) are associated with greater rates of hospital mortality
(11, 12, 17). More recently, the same finding has been demonstrated for patients with severe sepsis (8, 10). Inappropriate

antimicrobial treatment has been shown to be an important
independent risk factor for mortality among hospitalized patients with serious infections, including bloodstream infections
(12, 19). Unfortunately, changing of the antimicrobial therapy
to an appropriate regimen after identification of a microorganism and its antimicrobial susceptibility has not been demonstrated to improve clinical outcomes (20, 32). These studies
suggest that clinicians should strive to administer appropriate
initial antimicrobial treatment to patients with serious infections, including fungal bloodstream infections, at the earliest
time possible after suspecting the presence of infection. In
addition to selecting an appropriate initial antimicrobial regimen, optimal dosing, an optimal interval of drug administration, and an optimal duration of treatment are required for
antimicrobial efficacy, limiting toxicity, and prevention of the
emergence of bacterial resistance (18).
Harbarth et al. examined 224 episodes of bloodstream infection among patients admitted to a surgical intensive care
unit (11). They found that appropriate antimicrobial therapy
was an independent determinant of survival and that mortality
rates were highest for patients infected with pathogens causing
infections most likely to be treated with inappropriate initial
antimicrobial regimens (Candida species, Enterobacter species,
and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Similarly, we previously showed
for individual microorganisms that there is a statistically significant correlation between the rates of inappropriate antimicrobial treatment for bloodstream infections and the associated hospital mortality rates (12). Fungal bloodstream
infections had among the highest rates of inappropriate initial
treatment and hospital mortality for all etiologic agents of
bloodstream infections examined (12). Three recent studies of
patients with severe sepsis, many of whom had bloodstream
infections, including fungal bloodstream infections, also demonstrated that inappropriate initial antimicrobial therapy was
associated with greater hospital mortality (6, 8, 10). These
investigations support the importance of avoiding delays in the
administration of appropriate antibiotics to patients with serious infections, including Candida bloodstream infections.
The studies that have evaluated inappropriate initial treatment for bloodstream infections suggest that the most common
cause of inappropriate treatment for fungal bloodstream infections is the omission of initial empiric treatment (11, 12).
An important problem preventing the earlier recognition and
treatment of fungal bloodstream infections is the lack of specific clinical findings suggesting this diagnosis. Most authors
recommend the use of clinical risk factors to identify patients
at higher risk for fungal bloodstream infection (21, 30, 42).
These risk factors can be used to identify patients who may
benefit from empiric treatment for fungal bloodstream infection in the appropriate clinical setting. Additionally, the presence of prior antifungal treatment, especially with fluconazole,
may identify patients who would potentially benefit from empiric treatment with alternative antifungal agents until the
blood culture results become available (9, 35). Another approach is to consider the use of prophylactic antifungal treatment in high-risk patients in order to reduce the occurrence of
fungal bloodstream infections (7, 22). Unfortunately, this approach still does not directly address the problem of treatment
delays when fungal bloodstream infections eventually occur.
The more rapid diagnosis of Candida bloodstream infection
may be the optimal method for avoiding delays in the treatment of this important infection. PCR is a method that has
been evaluated to more rapidly identify the presence of Candida species, as well as other microorganisms, from clinical
specimens, including blood, spinal fluid, and tissue biopsy specimens (23). Proteomics-based identification of novel Candida
antigens for the diagnosis of systemic candidiasis offers an
alternative potential approach to the more rapid diagnosis of
this infection (31). Future clinical studies are needed to determine the overall operating characteristics of these diagnostic
techniques and whether molecular diagnostics can be developed to be used cost-effectively in the clinical laboratory setting.
Our study has several important limitations. First, we did not
identify risk factors for the development of fungal bloodstream
infection. Earlier reports have demonstrated that prolonged
hospitalization, prior treatment with antibiotics (particularly
broad-spectrum antibiotics), and colonization with Candida
species increase the likelihood of infection with this pathogen
(4, 33, 40). The presence of such risk factors has been advocated as a trigger for the empiric treatment of potentially
antibiotic-resistant bacteria and, when appropriate, fungal
pathogens (18). Second, our study was performed at a single
site, and the results may not be applicable to other settings.
However, the consistent relationship between inappropriate
treatment of serious infections and outcome that has been
demonstrated suggests that this is a more universal finding,
with applicability to patients with fungal bloodstream infections (11, 12). Third, we did not routinely perform susceptibility testing with the clinical isolates identified. Therefore, we
could not determine the overall occurrence of inappropriate
antifungal treatment when it was prescribed. Nevertheless, the
main goal of our study was to evaluate the influence of temporal delays in the administration of antifungal treatment on
patient outcomes. Fourth, we had only nine patients receiving
appropriate antifungal treatment within 12 h of having a positive blood sample for culture drawn, which limits the generalization of our results. Finally, we were able to demonstrate by
multivariable analysis a statistically significant relationship only
between the administration of empiric antifungal treatment
after 12 h from having a positive blood sample for culture
drawn and hospital mortality. This underscores the complex
nature of variables potentially influencing patient outcomes in
the presence of serious infections.
In summary, we demonstrated that the administration of
appropriate antimicrobial treatment more than 12 h after the
first positive blood sample for culture is drawn is associated, at
least by multivariable analysis, with hospital mortality. This
underscores the clinical importance of providing early appropriate treatment to patients with fungal bloodstream infections. Future studies are needed to define the optimal strategy
for the empiric treatment of fungal bloodstream infections.
Until such data become available, clinicians may consider the
use of empiric antifungal therapy in patients at high risk for
this infection to avoid delays in treatment.
