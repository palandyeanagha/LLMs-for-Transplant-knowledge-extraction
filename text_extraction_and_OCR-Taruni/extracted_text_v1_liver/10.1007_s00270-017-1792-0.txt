Abstract
Introduction Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty
(PTA), with or without stent placement, has become the
treatment of choice for portal vein complications (PVC)
following liver transplantation. We aimed to assess longterm outcomes of intervention in paediatric transplant
recipients, in a single institution.
Materials and Methods 227 children received 255 transplants between November 2000 and September 2016. 30
patients developed PVC of whom 21 had percutaneous
intervention. Retrospective clinical and procedural outcome data on these 21 patients were collected.
Results 21 patients, with median age 1.7 years (range
0.4–16.2), underwent 42 procedures with PTA with or
without stenting. 36 procedures were for PV stenosis and 6
for PV thrombosis. Treatment was with primary PTA, with
stenting reserved for suboptimal PTA result or restenosis
within 3 months. 28 procedures were performed with PTA
and 13 with stenting. Technical success ([50% reduction
in mean pressure gradient, absolute pressure gradient
B4 mmHg or venographic stenosis\30%) was achieved in
41 procedures. Failure to recanalise a thrombosed PV
occurred in 1 procedure. There were no major procedural
complications. Patients were followed-up with serial
Doppler ultrasound surveillance. Kaplan–Meier estimated
median primary patency was 9.9 months, with primaryassisted patency of 95% after median follow-up of
45.5 months (range 11.1–171.6).
Conclusion With regular surveillance, excellent patency
rates can be achieved following percutaneous intervention
for PVC post-paediatric liver transplantation.

Introduction
Portal vein complications (PVC) following paediatric liver
transplantation have an incidence of \3–14% [1] and can
lead to graft failure resulting in significant morbidity and
mortality [2–4]. Risk factors for PV thrombosis (PVT) or
PV stenosis (PVS) include age under 1 year old at first
transplant, lower body weight, preexisting portosystemic
shunts with decreased PV flow [5–7] and hypoplasia of the
PV, commonly seen in patients with biliary atresia [8–10].
Clinical manifestations of PVC are those of portal hypertension, including new onset ascites, splenomegaly and
variceal bleeding. Abnormal liver function tests and even
liver failure may occur with early PVT post-liver transplant. Some patients are asymptomatic [4].
Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) with or
without stent placement, first reported by Raby in 1991 [11],
has become the primary treatment option for PVC following
liver transplantation. The surgical alternative would be
either reconstruction of the portal vein, placement of an
interposition graft (from the recipient living donor or
cadaveric donor) or use of a mesenterico-left portal shunt
(so-called meso-Rex shunt). In a small child with a postoperative abdomen, a surgical approach can be challenging.

In this paper, we report the midterm and long-term
technical and clinical outcomes of PV intervention from a
single paediatric transplant centre.
Materials and Methods
Patients
Patients under 18 years old, who underwent liver transplantation at our institution between November 2000 and
September 2016, were identified retrospectively from a
local paediatric transplant database.
Post-transplantation ultrasound Doppler (USD) was
performed at days one, two, three, five and seven, months
three and twelve, and thereafter annually. PVC was suspected at follow-up if there were clinical signs and symptoms of portal hypertension, or if on USD there was a
velocity ratio of three or more, absolute velocity of greater
than 200 cm/s, or no flow. In selected patients suspected of
PVT (non-visualisation of the main PV or PV conduit,
together with low-velocity intrahepatic PV flow), additional CT or MRI was performed prior to intervention to
confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of thrombosis. Patients suspected of having PVC underwent portal
venography and pressure measurements, with percutaneous
intervention when indicated. If PVT occurred within
2 weeks post-transplantation, surgical anastomotic revision
was the preferred option.
Retrospective outcome data, on those who developed
PVC and underwent percutaneous intervention, were collected from the radiology information system, and from
electronic and hard copy patient records. Demographic
information, technical success of the procedure, clinical
success, procedural complications, primary and primaryassisted patency and current patient status were determined. Follow-up data were collected up to and including
15th July 2017.
Procedural Technique
Informed consent was obtained from parents/guardians and
where appropriate the patients, for all procedures. All
procedures were performed under general anaesthesia. The
exact procedural technique has been adapted over time due
to changes in available consumables and devices. The
following is a description of our current technique.
Ultrasound guided percutaneous PV access is gained
using a micropuncture access set (Cook Medical Inc,
Limerick, Ireland), and a 5F arterial sheath is inserted. The
stenosis is crossed with a Cobra 2 or Berenstein catheter
(Cordis, Baar, Switzerland) and angled glide wire (Terumo
UK Ltd, Bagshot, UK). Where difficulty in crossing the
lesion is experienced either arterioportography (n = 1) or
trans-splenic puncture (n = 1) are performed to provide
more anatomical detail and assist in traversing the lesion.
Portal venography (Fig. 1A) and pressure measurements
are taken. If a significant stenosis is confirmed, PTA is
performed (Fig. 1B). Heparin 75 IU/Kg is administered.
The balloon diameter is based on the pre-stenotic PV
diameter, inflated to between nominal and rated burst
pressure, for 1 min. Repeat pressure measurements and
venography are then performed to confirm success
(Fig. 1C). Stenting is reserved for patients with a residual
stenosis or significant pressure gradient following prolonged balloon inflation for 2–3 min, or patients who have
early restenosis within 3 months. Stents are placed eccentrically across the lesion minimising stent coverage of the
recipient PV. Finally, a gelatin sponge pledget is used to
plug the transhepatic tract. Unless contraindicated, patients
are placed on a single antiplatelet agent (Aspirin) longterm. Post-procedure anticoagulation with Heparin or
Warfarin is not routine.
Follow-Up
Patients having intervention had clinical and DUS followup, along with serum albumin levels and platelet count, at
Fig. 1 Portal vein PTA procedure from a 9-year-old male with PVS.
A Initial venography after crossing the lesion demonstrates a focal
high-grade PV stenosis at the surgical anastomosis, and pressure
gradient of 3 mmHg B PTA balloon inflated across the stenosis.
C Venography following PTA shows a markedly improved appearance, with no residual stenosis, and pressure gradient of 0 mmHg.

the following intervals: pre-discharge, at 3, 6, 12, 18,
24 months and then annually.
Definitions
Technical success was defined as having at least one of the
following apply: a pressure gradient B4 mmHg; C50%
drop in pressure gradient from baseline and\30% residual
venographic stenosis.
Clinical success of each procedure was assessed using four
separate indicators: reduction in complications of portal
hypertension, defined as ascites, variceal bleeding, splenomegaly with moderate thrombocytopenia (platelet count
\100 9 109
/L), hepatorenal syndrome, or hepatopulmonary
syndrome; reduction in spleen size measured on ultrasound;
increased platelet count and increased serum albumin. For
each indicator, results were compared from just prior to the
procedure to the first result at least 3-month post-procedure.
Patency is reported as primary and primary-assisted
patency, according to Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS)
reporting standards [12]. Primary patency was defined as
time from primary intervention to first imaging diagnosis
of either restenosis or thrombosis. Primary-assisted patency
was defined as time from primary intervention to first
imaging diagnosis of thrombosis.
Complications were graded according to SVS reporting
standards (mild, moderate and severe) [12] and Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe
(CIRSE) standards (grade 1–6) [13].
Statistical Analysis
Two-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to evaluate differences between paired data. p\0.05 was considered statistically significant. The Kaplan–Meier method
was used to determine the cumulative primary and primary-assisted patency. Microsoft Excel 2016 and IBM
SPSS Statistics 22 were used for data collection and statistical analysis, respectively.
Results
Demographics
Between November 2000 and September 2016, 227 paediatric patients (aged\18 years) received 255 liver
transplants at our institution. Median age at transplantation
was 3.3 years (range 0.1–17.8). Post-transplantation follow-up identified 30 patients with PVC, 29 transplanted at
our institution and one elsewhere: Seven had operative PV
reconstruction, two had no treatment and 21 had percutaneous intervention.
Those with PVC transplanted at our institute (n = 29)
were younger (median age 0.9 vs. 3.3 years) and of lower
weight (median weight 7.1 vs. 14.0 kg) than our overall
transplant population, and a greater proportion had biliary
atresia as their indication for transplant (65.5 vs. 30.8%).
Table 1 summarises the demographics of the 21 patients
who underwent percutaneous intervention for PVC.
Technical Success
42 interventions were performed by four consultant interventional radiologists (34 by authors JP and NT), 36 for
PVS and six for PVT, with a median of two per patient
(range 1–5). Of the six instances of PVT, one was associated a large portal cavernoma (Fig. 2), two with smaller
hilar portal collaterals and large varices, one with large
oesophageal varices alone and in two cases, no cross-sectional or venographic imaging of the extrahepatic portal/
splanchnic veins was available. Technical success was
achieved in 41 of 42 interventions (97.6%). In one case,
there was failure to recanalise a thrombosed PV. This
patient underwent re-transplantation 12 months later for
long-standing recurrent cholangitis, unrelated to the PVT.
28 of 41 procedures required PTA alone (with 6–10 mm
balloons). 13 procedures (11/21 patients) required stent
insertion (7–12 mm stents; eight Palmaz Blue, three Wallstent, one Luminexx and one Prote´ge´) (Cordis, Baar,
Switzerland; Boston Scientific, Clonmel, Ireland; BARD
GmbH/Angiomed, Karlsruhe, Germany and Medtronic Ltd,
Watford, UK). Four stenting procedures were for poor PTA
result, three for PVT plus two recurrences in one patient and
one for PVT in another patient. Nine patients had single
stent procedures for early restenosis, seven at their second
procedure (one subsequently developed in-stent restenosis
requiring PTA) and two at their third. Where data were
available (n = 28), there was a recorded median fluoroscopy time of 10.3 min (range 2.5–47.1), dose area product (DAP) of 258 cGy/m2 (range 35–3831) and overall
procedure time (time from patient arrival in the department
to completion of the procedure) of 135 min (range 60–280).
Pre-intervention and post-intervention pressure gradients were measured in 34 of 41 procedures, with a significant fall in the median gradient from 10.5 mmHg (range
2–22) pre-intervention to 2.0 mmHg (range 0–10) postintervention (p\0.001). The patient with a pre-procedure
pressure gradient of 2 mmHg had a venographic stenosis of
63%, and therefore, fulfilled the criteria for intervention.
Procedural Complications
There was one mild/grade 1 complication. This patient with
PVT developed a small groin haematoma following an arterioportogram, which resolved without active intervention.

There were two moderate/grade 3 complications. Each
patient had a focal, small, non-occlusive thrombus and
brisk flow within an intrahepatic PV branch at the end of
the procedure. They were commenced on therapeutic
heparin post-procedure for 48 h and 14 days, respectively.
Neither had residual thrombus on ultrasound pre-discharge
and at 14 days.
Clinical Success
Six procedures had no 3-month follow-up, five due to reintervention within 3 months and one technical failure.
These were, therefore, excluded from this analysis.
Incomplete availability of paired pre/post-intervention data
for splenomegaly with platelet count \100 9 109
/L
excluded a further four patients for this indicator.
Seven procedures (six patients) were associated with
complications of portal hypertension pre-intervention: two
splenomegaly with platelet count \100 9 109
/L, one
ascites, four variceal bleeding, one hepatorenal syndrome.
All had resolved by 3 months.
There was significant reduction in spleen size
(10.5 to 9.8 cm, p = 0.032) and significant increase in
platelet count (191 to 204 9 109 g/L, p = 0.022), but no
significant change in serum albumin (41 to 42 g/L,
p = 0.444). Although platelet count increased,

thrombocytopenia (platelet count\150 9 109
/L) was only
present prior to 12 of 31 interventions with paired data
available.
Patency
Ultrasound follow-up was available for a median of
45.5 months (range 11.1–171.6). Median primary patency
was 9.9 months, with rates falling early in the study period.
Primary patency was 42.9, 42.9, 35.7 and 28.6% at 1, 3, 5
and 10 years, respectively. Surveillance and re-intervention
maintained good rates of primary-assisted patency. One
patient had early reocclusion of a stent at 8 months,
resulting in a primary-assisted patency of 95.0% at 1 year,
and maintained to 10 years (Fig. 3).
Current Patient Status
Outpatient clinical follow-up was available for a median of
65.0 months (range 13.1–189.5). All 21 patients were alive
at last follow-up. Two had re-transplantation for chronic
recurrent cholangitis and chronic rejection, at 12 and
25 months following the last intervention, respectively. Two
had biliary strictures requiring repeated interventions. The
remaining 17 are clinically well with good graft function.
Discussion
Portal vein complications are seen more frequently in
paediatric patients following liver transplantation than in
adults. This is due, in part, to greater use of split liver grafts
in children. In addition, biliary atresia is a common indication for paediatric liver transplantation, and the associated PV hypoplasia contributes to PVC [8–10]. In our
institution, the incidence of post-transplantation PVC was
11.4% (29/255), at the higher end of reported rates [1], but
comparable to those with a similar median age at transplantation [8, 14, 15].
Consistent with evidence that younger age and biliary
atresia represent risk factors for development of PVC
[5, 7, 9], in our study patients who developed PVC were
younger than the general paediatric liver transplant population at our institution, and there was a greater proportion
of patients transplanted for biliary atresia in the PVC group

with hepatopulmonary syndrome. She had a whole graft liver
transplant at the age of 1 year for biliary atresia. A Initial portal
venography following percutaneous right PV access demonstrates
patent intrahepatic PV branches with an intact PV bifurcation.
B Following traversal of the occluded PV, venography shows
occlusion extending from the main SMV trunk, with an occluded
PV confluence and an associated large portal cavernoma. C After
deployment of overlapping self-expanding stents, there is in-line PV
flow from the SMV into the liver and the cavernoma is no longer seen
to perfuse. Small volume non-occlusive thrombus is noted at the
origin of the left portal vein, adjacent to the stent. This resolved
following 48 h of therapeutic heparinisation. There was resolution of
the hepatopulmonary syndrome post-procedure and the patient
remains clinically well at 9 years’ follow-up. PV portal vein, SMV

compared to the overall transplant population (65.5 vs.
30.8%). Younger and lower weight patients, and those with
biliary atresia, have smaller recipient portal veins and are
more likely to have donor-recipient vessel mismatch
requiring a PV conduit, both of which are likely to predispose to PV complications [5, 9].
PVC may be found incidentally on USD surveillance or
present clinically with graft dysfunction and/or complications of portal hypertension. Similar to other series, our
institution’s cross-specialty consensus opinion is to
actively intervene in patients with PVS, whether symptomatic or incidental, to prevent subsequent complications
of portal hypertension, graft dysfunction or progression to
PVT [1, 16]. We only consider intervening in asymptomatic patients if PV Doppler velocity gradient is three or
more. PVT adversely affects patient and graft survival, and
thrombus extending to the PV confluence makes re-transplantation more complex [9]. Furthermore, crossing a
stenosis during percutaneous intervention is simpler than
crossing a thrombosed PV. Our only technical failure was
in a patient with PVT.
Our technique for PV intervention with either a transhepatic or transhepatic/trans-splenic approach is similar to
other series [17, 18] and resulted in high-technical success
(97.6%). A trans-splenic approach was only required in one
of the six cases with PVT and in none of the cases with
PVS. In the former case, the trans-splenic puncture was
used for venography to clarify the diagnosis of PVT, which
remained unclear despite a CT scan, and to assist in
crossing the lesion from a combined transhepatic/transsplenic approach. In contrast to Carnevale et al. [19], we
did not routinely perform an arterioportogram, this being
required in only one patient with PVT. No patients had
transileocolic access.
We take a selective approach to stenting because stents
will not grow with the child, and may eventually result in a
‘fixed stenosis’. Nevertheless, just over half of our patients
eventually required stent placement. Future developments
in stent technology, such as biodegradable stents, may
change our approach. Our current preference is to use a
7-mm-diameter Palmaz Blue stent (Cordis, Baar and
Switzerland), which can be dilated further to 8 mm, if
required, whilst still maintaining its structural integrity.
Dilatation beyond this may result in loss of hoop strength
or stent fracture, but would make future insertion of a
larger, adult size stent feasible [20, 21]. Being a balloon
expandable stent, the Palmaz Blue can be positioned
accurately, minimising the length of stent extending into
the recipient PV. If too much of the stent extends into the
recipient PV, this may not leave sufficient length of PV for
an end-to-end anastomosis if re-transplantation becomes
necessary. The patient would then require a conduit from

the recipient superior mesenteric vein (SMV) onto the
donor PV. Precision of stent placement also becomes
important if there is subsequent stent thrombosis, since an
intact splenic-mesenteric confluence leaves available the
option of future surgical bypass with a meso-Rex shunt to
restore hepatopetal PV flow.
The four largest comparable published series to date are
summarised in Table 2 [1, 16, 17, 19], with comparator
results from the present study also included. The number of
interventions reported in these studies ranged from eight to
66. Technical and clinical success ranged from 76 to 100%.
However, the reporting and definitions of technical success
and clinical success varied between the studies, limiting
direct comparison of outcomes.
The largest study, with the longest follow-up, and only
study reporting primary and primary-assisted patency
showed primary patency of 83, 78, 76 and 70%, and
primary-assisted patency of 100, 100, 100 and 96%, at 1,
3, 5 and 10 years, respectively [1]. Lower primary
patency rates in our study may reflect the younger age
and associated smaller PV diameter at first intervention.
Difference in suturing techniques for the portal venous
anastomosis may also play a role, with continuous
suturing used at our centre, but interrupted suturing preferred in Japanese centres. Continuous suturing is associated with poorer compliance of vascular anastomoses
[22, 23]. However, suturing technique was not reported by
Yabuta et al. [1]. Our primary-assisted patency rates are
comparable.
PV intervention, especially in the context of PVS, is a
relatively low-risk procedure; only one of 36 of the interventions for PVS and two of six for PVT were associated
with a complication. Two of these required additional
medical treatment. None required additional intervention
or surgery. Two of the other series do, however, describe
complications directly related to the intervention requiring
additional invasive procedures [1, 16].
Other published studies reporting PV intervention following paediatric liver transplantation are limited by very
small numbers of cases, short durations of follow-up,
combined reporting of outcomes in paediatric and adult
patients or reporting of outcomes of stent placement alone
[11, 24–28].
Limitations of the current study include those inherent to
a retrospective case series, including incomplete data
availability. Small patient numbers precludes more rigorous study designs at single institutions. Variation in technique and developments in technology over the prolonged
time course of the study makes results less generalisable to
future patients, though technological advances are likely to
improve outcomes.
Good long-term patency and clinical outcomes are
achievable with judicious surveillance following
percutaneous intervention for post-transplantation PVC in
paediatric patients. Future developments in biodegradable
stents may overcome the issue of fixed stenoses in growing
children and may improve primary patency, reducing reintervention. Despite the need for ongoing surveillance and
re-intervention, in the absence of a low-risk alternative,
PTA remains the treatment of choice.
