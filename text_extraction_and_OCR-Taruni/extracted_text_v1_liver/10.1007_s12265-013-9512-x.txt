Abstract This phase II, open-label, single-treatment arm
study evaluated the pharmacodynamics, efficacy, and safety
of tafamidis in patients with non-Val30Met transthyretin
(TTR) amyloidosis. Twenty-one patients with eight different
non-Val30Met mutations received 20 mg QD of tafamidis
meglumine for 12 months. The primary outcome, TTR
stabilization at Week 6, was achieved in 18 (94.7 %) of 19
patients with evaluable data. TTR was stabilized in 100 % of
patients with non-missing data at Months 6 (n =18) and 12
(n =17). Exploratory efficacy measures demonstrated some
worsening of neurological function. However, health-related
quality of life, cardiac biomarker N-terminal pro-hormone
brain natriuretic peptide, echocardiographic parameters, and
modified body mass index did not demonstrate clinically
relevant worsening during the 12 months of treatment.
Tafamidis was well tolerated. In conclusion, our findings
suggest that tafamidis 20 mg QD effectively stabilized TTR
associated with several non-Val30Met variants.

Introduction
Transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) is both an inherited and an
age-related amyloidosis. The most common phenotypic presentations of hereditary ATTR are sensorimotor and autonomic
polyneuropathy (TTR familial amyloid polyneuropathy (TTRFAP)) and cardiomyopathy [1]. The protein implicated in
ATTR, TTR, is a tetrameric transport protein for thyroxine
and the retinol-binding protein–retinol (vitamin A) complex
[2, 3]. TTR is synthesized primarily in the liver [4]. Mutations
in the gene that encodes for TTR cause dissociation of the TTR
tetramer to monomers. This leads to the formation of insoluble
fibrillar proteins (or amyloid) that accumulate and produce
deleterious effects on tissues and organ function [5–8].
The age at onset of ATTR varies between the second and
ninth decades of life, and there is great heterogeneity in

genetic penetrance, depending on phenotype, genotype, and
environmental factors [1, 9]. However, the outcome of ATTR
is invariably progressive and fatal: After a mean interval of
10 years from initial presentation of symptoms, patients usually die from progressive and relentless worsening of the
neuropathy, secondary infections, cachexia, or cardiac complications [1, 9, 10].
More than 100 amyloidogenic TTR point mutations have
been identified in patients with familial ATTR [11, 12]. The
most common genetic variant associated with polyneuropathy
is Val30Met (valine replaced by methionine at position 30 of
the amino acid chain), which accounts for ≈85 % of TTR-FAP
cases worldwide [13, 14]. Generally, non-Val30Met mutations
are associated with greater cardiac involvement than
Val30Met mutations [12, 14], and patients with nonVal30Met mutations and a cardiac phenotype tend to be older
men and have lower survival rates [15].
Liver transplantation, which removes the main site of mutant TTR production, has been the only disease-modifying
treatment option for TTR-FAP. Following transplantation,
mutant transthyretin protein becomes undetectable in serum
[16, 17]; neurological symptoms frequently halt or improve
[18]; and the reported 5-year survival rate is 77 % [18, 19].
However, cardiac disease tends to progress even after successful liver transplantation, especially in non-Val30Met patients,
most likely due to the deposition of wild-type TTR on preexisting amyloid deposits [1, 9]. Indeed, several nonVal30Met variants, including Glu42Gly, Ala36Pro [20],
Ser52Pro, and Ile84Thr [21], have been linked to rapid postoperative progression of TTR cardiac amyloidosis. This partially explains why, according to recent data from the Familial
Amyloid Polyneuropathy World Transplant Registry, the rate
of survival at 5 years is significantly worse in patients with
non-Val30Met mutations compared to patients with the
Val30Met mutation (59 % versus 82 %; p <0.0001) [14] and
has led to the proposal to consider the extremely challenging
procedure of combined heart and liver transplantation in certain ATTR patients with cardiac involvement [1, 22]. Taken
together, this underlines the need for additional treatment
options not only for patients with ATTR in general but also
for patients with non-Val30Met mutants in particular.
Tafamidis meglumine (Pfizer Inc, New York, NY, USA) is
an oral agent that occupies the two thyroxine binding sites on
TTR. This is associated with inhibition of dissociation of TTR
into monomers, the rate-limiting step in amyloid formation
[11, 23]. In an 18-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
randomized trial, tafamidis demonstrated TTR stabilization
and slowed the progression of peripheral neurological impairment compared with placebo in patients who had TTR-FAP
associated with Val30Met mutations [24]. Individuals with
other TTR variants were excluded from that study. The primary objective of our open-label, single-arm study was to
determine the pharmacodynamic stabilization effects of
tafamidis on non-Val30Met TTR variants. The safety and
exploratory efficacy of tafamidis were also evaluated.
Materials and Methods
Study Design
This 12-month study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00630864) enrolled men and women at four research centers in France,
Germany, Italy, and the United States between June 2008 and
January 2010. An open-label design was used, given the low
prevalence of non-Val30Met mutations and the fact that TTR
stabilization is a laboratory-determined measure that would not
be influenced by knowledge of treatment assignment.
The study was conducted in two parts. In part 1, patients
received tafamidis 20 mg QD for 6 weeks. At Week 6, blood
samples were collected to determine TTR stabilization. Patients who did not demonstrate TTR stabilization at Week 6
were to be discontinued from the study. In part 2, all patients
demonstrating stabilization at the Week 6 visit continued to
receive tafamidis 20 mg QD for up to a total of 12 months.
Additional laboratory evaluations for TTR stabilization were
performed at Months 6 and 12. The study was approved by the
local institutional review boards at each site and conducted in
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients gave
written informed consent.
Study Population
Men and nonpregnant women aged 18–75 years were eligible if
they had symptomatic, biopsy-confirmed TTR amyloidosis
with a Karnofsky Performance Status of ≥50 and a known
pathogenic TTR-FAP mutation other than Val30Met or
Val122Ile. Other exclusion criteria were primary or secondary
amyloidosis, prior liver transplant (or expected liver transplant
within 12 months of enrollment), hepatitis B or C or HIV
infection, impaired renal or hepatic function, a New York Heart
Association functional class of ≥3, other causes of sensorimotor
neuropathy (e.g., vitamin B12 deficiency, diabetes mellitus), any
prior non-amyloid cardiac disease or cardiomyopathy, or a life
expectancy of <12 months due to any comorbidity. Two patients who were over 75 years of age but met all other inclusion
criteria were granted waivers and enrolled in the study.
Outcome Measures
TTR stabilization was determined by a validated immunoturbidimetric method [23]. Briefly, the TTR tetramer concentration in each plasma sample was measured before and after
2 days of denaturation in 4.8 M urea. The ratio of the postdenaturation to the pre-denaturation values was recorded as the
fraction of initial (FOI) tetramer concentration. Because the
1012 J. of Cardiovasc. Trans. Res. (2013) 6:1011–1020

mechanism of action of tafamidis is to bind to TTR and inhibit
dissociation, it should result in a higher FOI than pretreatment
baseline values in patients. The FOI at each on-study timepoint
was compared with the pretreatment FOI, yielding a percent
stabilization using the following formula: [25]
Percent %ð Þstabilization ¼ 100  ð Þ FOI dosed–FOI baseline =FOI baseline
A stabilization cut-off value was derived from data obtained
from placebo-treated healthy volunteers in a phase I single and
multiple ascending-dose study. Values above the 95 % confidence interval (CI) of placebo-treated healthy volunteers (32 %)
were classified as “stabilized” [25].
Neurological impairment was assessed using the Neuropathy
Impairment Score (NIS), which captures clinically meaningful
changes in neurological function (i.e., sensation, muscle weakness, reflexes) over time [26, 27]. The NIS has been validated in
patients with diabetic neuropathy [28, 29]. Measures included
both of the lower limbs (NIS-LL; 0–88 points) and upper limbs
(NIS–UL; 0–156 points) NIS subscales, as well as the composite
NIS score (0–244 points). In addition, large nerve fiber function
was assessed using the summated five nerve conduction study
normal deviate (Σ5 NCS nds) composite score, which combines
results from five nerve conduction studies (sural nerve sensory
nerve action potential, peroneal nerve compound muscle action
potential, peroneal nerve motor conduction velocity, peroneal
nerve distal motor latency, and tibial nerve distal motor latency)
[30]. Scores range from −15 to 15, with higher scores indicating
poorer large-fiber neurological function.
Quality of life (QOL) was evaluated using the Norfolk
Quality of Life–Diabetic Neuropathy (Norfolk QOL-DN)
questionnaire [31]. The 35-item version of this patientcompleted questionnaire was used, which yielded a total
QOL (TQOL) score ranging from −2 to 138, with higher
scores indicating worse QOL.
The modified body mass index (mBMI) was calculated by
multiplying the BMI (kilograms per square meter) by the
serum albumin concentration (grams per liter) to correct for
weight gains due to swelling and edema, common features of
TTR amyloidosis [32]. The mBMI provides a more accurate
indicator of malnutrition and gastrointestinal dysfunction than
the BMI and is an important measure of wasting in patients
with TTR-FAP [32].
Troponin I and N-terminal pro-hormone brain natriuretic
peptide (NT-pro-BNP) are cardiac biomarkers; the latter may
have prognostic value for patients with ATTR [33]. Measurements of both biomarkers were made from patient plasma
samples, and changes from baseline were calculated at each
follow-up visit. Given the likelihood of cardiac involvement in
patients with ATTR, echocardiography was performed at baseline and at Months 6 and 12 according to the American Society
of Echocardiography and the European Association of Echocardiography guidelines [34] and was centrally over-read by a
core laboratory to ensure consistent interpretation. Measurements included left ventricular (LV) wall thickness (LVW);
interventricular septal thickness (IVS); left atrial diameter; LV
Mass; left ventricular ejection fraction; and ratio of mitral peak
velocity of early filling to early diastolic mitral annular velocity
(E/E’ ratio). Likewise, conventional 12-lead electrocardiograms were recorded at baseline and throughout the study.
Adverse events (AEs) were monitored from the start of the
study through 30 days after administration of the last tafamidis
dose. Serious AEs (SAEs) were those that resulted in death, were
considered life-threatening, required hospitalization, resulted in
significant disability/incapacity, or were otherwise considered
important medical events by the principal investigator.
Statistical Analysis
The primary endpoint was TTR stabilization (percent stabilization response defined as >32 %) at Week 6 compared with
baseline; secondary endpoints were TTR stabilization at
Months 6 and 12. The number and proportion of patients who
achieved stabilization were calculated at each point, and the
95 % CI of the proportion of patients stabilized was calculated.
Exploratory efficacy endpoints included change from baseline
at Months 6 and 12 in the NIS, NIS-LL, NIS-UL, TQOL score,
Σ5 NCS nds composite score, mBMI, and cardiac biomarkers.
For these, change from baseline over time was summarized at
each follow-up visit by descriptive statistics, with the 95 % CI
calculated for mean changes. Analyses were performed based
on observed data from the intent-to-treat population, defined as
all patients who received at least one dose of study medication.
We undertook a post hoc analysis to assess changes in NTpro-BNP levels in patients whose concentrations of this biomarker suggested an increased risk for heart failure (NT-proBNP >1,000 pg/mL) or a lower risk for heart failure (NT-proBNP <300 pg/mL). These NT-pro-BNP cut-off points were
based on studies of patients presenting to the emergency
department with dyspnea: Higher NT-pro-BNP concentrations
have been demonstrated to be a strong predictor of heart
failure mortality at 1 year [35], while the lower concentration
has been used as a cut-off to rule out heart failure [36, 37]. The
mean and median changes in NT-pro-BNP levels from pretreatment (the average of the screening and baseline levels)
were examined at Months 6 and 12.
An additional post hoc analysis was performed to examine
changes from baseline in echocardiographic parameters at
Month 12 in patients meeting the primary echocardiographic
criterion for amyloid heart involvement defined as thickness
of the interventricular septum >12 mm [1, 38].
Safety analyses, including assessment of AEs, treatmentrelated AEs, and SAEs, were performed on the safety population, which included all enrolled patients who received at
least one dose of study medication.

A sample size of up to 24 patients was chosen for the study
based on the underlying size of the TTR-FAP population and
as sufficient to adequately characterize the 95 % CI for the
point estimate for TTR stabilization at Week 6. With a sample
size ranging from 18 to 24 patients, assuming ≤2 patients did
not achieve TTR stabilization at Week 6, the TTR stabilization
rate would be ≥88 % and the lower bound of the two-sided
95 % CI would be ≥65 %.
Results
Patients
Of the 21 patients enrolled, 18 (85.7 %) completed the trial.
One patient discontinued in part 1 due to an SAE (transient
ischemic attack), and two patients discontinued in part 2 due to
organ transplants. The baseline demographics for the intent-totreat population are presented in Table 1. The mean (±standard
deviation (SD)) duration of ATTR-related symptoms at baseline
was 64.7±60.8 months (median, 45.5 months), with a mean
age at onset of 59.3±9.2 years (median, 61.0). Table 2 displays
the results of the patients’ baseline assessments. The patients
demonstrated significant impairment in neurological function
(NIS: mean ± SD, 48.7±44.3 and median, 45.0; Σ5 NCS: mean
± SD, 6.1±5.9 and median, 6.7) and disease-specific QOL
(mean ± SD Norfolk TQOL score, 47.8±35.1; median, 38.0).
Of note, the mean mBMI at the baseline visit was 1,052.5±
206.7 kg/m2
×g/L (median, 1,047.8), which meaningfully exceeds the screening threshold associated with improved survival following liver transplantation of 600 kg/m2
×g/L [39].
The enrolled patients had eight different non-Val30Met TTR
mutations (Table 1). All patients except one reported symptoms
of peripheral neuropathy, 13 of 21 (62 %) reported symptoms of
cardiac involvement, and 5 of 21 (23.8 %) had peripheral and
autonomic neuropathy plus cardiomyopathy. All patients demonstrated at least one echocardiographic abnormality, the most
common being left ventricular posterior wall thickness and left
ventricular septal thickness of >12 mm, which were each
observed in 17 of 19 (89.5 %) patients. Abnormalities on
electrocardiography were also common at baseline, occurring
in 16 of 21 (76.2 %) of patients. Of these, conduction abnormalities were the most common, in 13 of 21 (61.9 %) patients,
and left anterior hemiblock and first-degree atrioventricular
block were the most frequent conduction abnormalities.
TTR Stabilization
TTR stabilization at Week 6 was achieved in 18 (94.7 %) of
the 19 intent-to-treat patients for whom both baseline and
Week 6 data were available (Table 3). Two intent-to-treat
patients were not included in the analysis at Week 6: One
discontinued prior to Week 6 due to a SAE, and one had a
missing baseline assay value (thus, postbaseline TTR stabilization could not be determined for this patient at any
timepoint). Only one patient (TTR mutation Gly47Ala) did
not demonstrate TTR stabilization at Week 6. In the absence
of apparent issues with compliance or AEs, this patient was
reassessed at Month 3 and allowed to continue in the study
because he did achieve stabilization at Months 3 and 6 but
discontinued before Month 12 to undergo an organ transplant.
At Months 6 and 12 (the secondary endpoints), 100 % of the
patients available for assessment achieved TTR stabilization
(Table 3).
Changes in Neurological Function
At Month 12, the mean increases from baseline in NIS, NISLL, and NIS-UL were 5.3 (95 % CI, –1.0, 11.5; median change,
1.6), 2.7 (95 % CI, –0.4, 5.8; median change, 1.0), and 2.5
(95 % CI, –1.2, 6.2; median change, 0.5), respectively (Fig. 1).
Patients with a higher baseline NIS (>70) experienced a greater
increase in NIS (i.e., a worsening of impairment) after
12 months compared with patients whose baseline scores were

lower. Twelve of the 18 patients with data at Month 12 experienced a change in NIS of ≤4 points at 12 months. These 12
patients represented all enrolled mutations, suggesting a similar
treatment effect across mutations.
There was a small mean increase of 0.2 (95 % CI −1.5, 1.8)
in Σ5 NCS nds score from baseline to Month 12, with a
median change of −0.1. When the analysis was performed
excluding patients with maximal abnormality in large nervefiber function at baseline (and, thus, no possibility of further
worsening), the results at Month 12 were similar, with a mean
change of 0.3 (95 % CI −2.1, 2.6).

Cardiac Function and Progression of Amyloid Heart Disease
Table 4 summarizes echocardiographic parameters in the
study group at baseline and 12-month follow-up (prespecified analysis). Values remained relatively stable from
baseline to Month 12, with no clinically relevant changes.
Results of the post hoc analysis in patients with amyloid
heart involvement at baseline (based on the standard diagnostic criterion IVS >12 mm [1, 38]) and a valid assessment at
Month 12 (n =12) were consistent with the findings for the
entire group; no clinically meaningful changes in morphological or functional parameters were observed over the
12-month treatment period. Four of the 12 patients did demonstrate disease progression as indexed by International Society of Amyloidosis criteria (increase in IVS thickness ≥2 mm
[38]).
Mean baseline troponin I concentrations were normal compared with established laboratory test ranges and remained
stable throughout the study. Baseline mean and median NTpro-BNP levels were elevated in all patients, with no clinically
relevant changes over time. Mean increases in NT-pro-BNP
concentrations were 228.4 (95 % CI −186.8, 643.6) pg/mL at
Month 6 and 306.6 (95 % CI −464.8, 1078.0) pg/mL at Month
12. Median values for change from baseline in NT-pro-BNP
were 66.5 pg/mL at Month 6 and 75.5 pg/mL at Month 12.
Figure 4 indicates the median baseline values and median
changes from baseline in NT-pro-BNP levels in: (a) the ten
patients classified as having a high likelihood of heart failure
(based on NT-pro-BNP levels >1,000 pg/mL at the Screening
or baseline visit); and (b) in the nine patients with a low
likelihood of heart failure (based on NT-pro-BNP levels
<300 pg/mL at the Screening or Baseline visit). Patients with
a high likelihood of heart failure had a median increase in NTpro-BNP levels of 521 pg/mL at Month 12, compared with a
median increase of 47 pg/mL in patients with a low likelihood
of heart failure. Nine of the ten patients with a high likelihood
of heart failure had a pretreatment history of cardiac events,
including heart failure/dyspnea (three patients) and arrhythmias (three patients). While on treatment, six of these ten
patients experienced events that were suggestive of heart
failure (four occurrences of peripheral edema and two of
dyspnea were reported). One of the cases of moderate peripheral edema occurred in a high likelihood heart failure patient
with no reported cardiac history at baseline. In addition, one of
these patients was recognized to have moderate coronary
artery stenosis during treatment and one required the insertion

Fig. 3 Change from baseline in mBMI scores (expressed as kilograms
per square meter×grams per liter) in the intent-to-treat population.
Starting with a relatively normal mBMI at baseline (mean ± SEM,
1,052.5±46.2; median, 1,047.8), the mBMI decreased slightly from
baseline to Month 6 (mean change ± SEM, –22.4±18.7; median change,
–26.7) and subsequently increased, producing a small positive overall
change from baseline to Month 12 (mean change ± SEM, 16.6±22.3;
median change, 8.3), indicating that the overall nutritional status was
maintained after 12 months of tafamidis treatment. The mBMI has been
adapted as a measure of nutritional status in TTR amyloidosis patients, as
multiplying the BMI (kilograms per square meter) by serum albumin
level (grams per liter) corrects for weight gains due to swelling and edema

of a pacemaker. In the patients considered to be at low likelihood of heart failure, one experienced arrhythmia while on
treatment with no identified prior history of arrhythmia.
Safety Results
Seventeen patients (81 %) experienced at least one AE, the
most common of which (reported in ≥10 % of patients) were
falls (five patients, 24 %), diarrhea (five patients, 24 %),
extremity pain (four patients, 19 %), and dizziness, dyspnea,
vomiting, and constipation (three patients each, 14 %). Four
SAEs occurred that were considered possibly related to treatment (ankle fracture, malaise, urinary retention, and transient
ischemic attack). The transient ischemic attack was considered
mild, and the patient had a history of hypertension and ATTRrelated congestive heart failure. This patient discontinued but
was treated and recovered. No patient died during the study.
Abnormalities observed on echocardiography and electrocardiography after the beginning of treatment did not indicate
adverse treatment effects of tafamidis and were consistent with
underlying cardiac morbidity. The most frequently reported
treatment-emergent electrocardiograph abnormality was arrhythmia, which occurred in 3 of 21 (14.3 %) patients at
baseline and 8 of 18 (44.4 %) patients on treatment. The most
common arrhythmia was represented by premature atrial contractions. Analysis of heart rate and electrocardiography interval measurements showed no effect of tafamidis on cardiac
conduction or repolarization. Similarly, most echocardiographic
parameters remained stable throughout the 12-month study
period, and reported changes were not considered clinically
meaningful (Table 4).
Discussion
In this phase II, open-label study, we demonstrated the efficacy of tafamidis in stabilizing TTR in a series of patients with
TTR-FAP associated with eight different non-Val30Met TTR
mutations. Stabilization of TTR was seen in all but one patient
at the 6-week primary endpoint and in all patients remaining at
the 6- and 12-month secondary endpoints. This finding was
accompanied by some worsening of neurological function at
Month 12 (NIS-LL score) but also with maintenance of QOL
(Norfolk QOL-DN total score) and mBMI.
A relationship between TTR tetramer stabilization and clinical outcomes has been established in carriers of the Val30Met
mutation that simultaneously carry an Arg104His or Thr119Met
trans-suppressor mutation on their second TTR allele [40–42].
Such compound heterozygotes develop mild pathology or no
disease because the trans-suppressor mutation increases the kinetic barrier for tetrameric dissociation, thereby blocking the
rate-limiting step of amyloid formation [40–42]. Given that
tafamidis also increases the threshold for tetramer dissociation,
it appears reasonable to assume a similar causal relationship

between TTR stabilization and the positive clinical outcomes
seen in this trial.
The finding of TTR stabilization in this study is consistent
with the 18-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of
tafamidis in patients with Val30Met TTR-FAP, in which 98 %
of patients treated with tafamidis achieved TTR stabilization at
18 months [24]. Overall, tafamidis has been shown to stabilize
TTR in 36 of 37 studied genotypes. In addition to the nine
variants in these two studies, these genotypes include Val122Ile
and wild-type TTR (from an open-label study in TTR amyloid
cardiomyopathy) [43], as well as an additional 25 of 26 mutations tested in an ex vivo study, with one TTR mutation
(Pro24Ser) demonstrating equivocal results potentially related
to the long storage time of the plasma sample [23, 25]. This
consistent response across variants is notable, given the large
number of point mutations that are associated with ATTR [12].
One unexpected finding is that the one patient who did not
achieve TTR stabilization at Week 6 (but was allowed to
continue tafamidis treatment as a protocol deviation) did
actually achieve stabilization at later time points. This interesting result shows that a decision to exclude this patient based
on the Week 6 assessment would have been premature and
will be reflected in our future study designs.
In the double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial
of tafamidis, patients on active treatment had 52 % less
neurological deterioration on the NIS-LL after 18 months
compared with placebo (a secondary endpoint), with a
change from baseline of 2.81 versus 5.83 points, respectively; p =0.027 [24]. In the present study, a similar change from
baseline (2.7 points) was observed on the NIS-LL after
12 months of treatment. It is possible that our trial duration
was not long enough to detect a significant change in
neurological course of the disease. The patients in our study
were also older than those in the double-blind trial, with
more severe cardiac involvement and more advanced neuropathy [24].
It should be noted that efforts to address the need for data
on long-term outcomes of treatment are in progress. Longerterm data are expected from an open-label extension study
that includes the patients who completed the current trial as
well as those from the 18-month trial (NCT00925002). All
patients will be followed in the open-label study until
tafamidis is commercially available in their respective countries. Of note, since European Medicines Agency approval
in 2011, tafamidis is now available in most European countries for the treatment of TTR amyloidosis in adult patients
with Stage 1 symptomatic polyneuropathy. In addition, longterm data on TTR-FAP patients enrolled in the Transthyretin
Amyloidosis Outcomes Survey (THAOS) registry, including
data from tafamidis-treated patients, will become available.
These efforts are also expected to provide data on survival
and functional outcomes such as ambulation.
Because of the reported high prevalence of cardiac manifestations in non-Val30Met ATTR, we assessed cardiac
involvement by multiple modalities, including cardiac biomarkers, electrocardiography, and echocardiography. Only
one patient had elevated concentrations of troponin I at
baseline which remained elevated at all post-baseline
timepoints. Patients with NT-pro-BNP levels >1,000 pg/mL
(high risk for heart failure) experienced cardiac events consistent with the presence of heart failure while receiving
treatment, including peripheral edema and dyspnea. This
group demonstrated a median increase in NT-pro-BNP of
520.5 pg/mL over time. Patients with baseline NT-pro-BNP
concentrations of <300 pg/mL (low risk for heart failure)
demonstrated a median increase in NT-pro-BNP concentrations of 47 pg/mL during treatment.

some of which were of several years duration, there was very
little apparent change in cardiac morbidity during the year of
treatment. Only four patients demonstrated an increase in IVS
thickness of ≥2 mm.
Tafamidis appeared to be well tolerated over 12 months.
The AEs reported were not unexpected for the age, neurological status, and cardiac conditions of patients in the study.
In addition to its relatively short duration, this study has
several other limitations, most notably the single-arm, openlabel design that makes it impossible to determine the efficacy
of tafamidis to slow or halt disease progression. While a doubleblind, placebo-controlled trial is ideal, the exceedingly low prevalence of TTR-FAP associated with mutations other than
Val30Met made such a design impractical. An inherent limitation
of the primary endpoint measure is that the immunoturbidimetric
assay performed under non-physiological conditions has been
developed as a qualitative measure of TTR stabilization and thus
cannot quantitate the degree of stabilization in vivo. The cardiac
biomarkers (troponin I and NT-proBNP) may be influenced by
other factors, such as sodium and fluid ingestion, blood pressure,
and paroxysmal supraventricular arrhythmia.
Overall, in patients with TTR-FAP due to the eight mutations evaluated, tafamidis at a dose of 20 mg QD was well
tolerated and effectively stabilized TTR in all but one patient
by Week 6 and in all patients by Month 6. Although some
worsening of neurological function was observed, mBMI and
QOL were maintained, and there did not appear to be clinically relevant worsening in cardiac status. Longer-term
follow-up is needed to delineate the potential longer-term
effects of TTR stabilization on these outcomes, as well as
controlled trials specifically evaluating the effects of tafamidis
on cardiac function and outcomes.
