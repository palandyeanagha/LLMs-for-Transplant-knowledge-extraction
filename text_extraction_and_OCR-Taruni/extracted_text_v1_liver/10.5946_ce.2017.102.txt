Gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy plays an indispensable role in the diagnosis and management of various pediatric GI disorders. While 
the pace of development of pediatric GI endoscopy has increased over the years, it remains sluggish compared to the advancements in 
GI endoscopic interventions available in adults. The predominant reasons that explain this observation include lack of formal training 
courses in advanced pediatric GI interventions, economic constraints in establishing a pediatric endoscopy unit, and unavailability of 
pediatric-specific devices and accessories. However, the situation is changing and more pediatric GI specialists are now performing 
complex GI procedures such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and endoscopic ultrasonography for various 
pancreatico-biliary diseases and more recently, per-oral endoscopic myotomy for achalasia cardia. Endoscopic procedures are associated 
with reduced morbidity and mortality compared to open surgery for GI disorders. Notable examples include chronic pancreatitis, 
pancreatic fluid collections, various biliary diseases, and achalasia cardia for which previously open surgery was the treatment modality 
of choice. A solid body of evidence supports the safety and efficacy of endoscopic management in adults. However, additions continue 
to be made to literature describing the pediatric population. An important consideration in children includes size of children, which in 
turn determines the selection of endoscopes and type of sedation that can be used for the procedure. Clin Endosc 2018;51:142-149

Introduction
Pediatric endoscopy is being performed over several decades and is an important diagnostic and therapeutic modality in the management of various pediatric gastrointestinal 
(GI) disorders. A major constraint for the development of endoscopy in children was unavailability of scopes of the desired 
size, inadequate expertise of pediatric gastroenterologists in 
performing advanced endoscopic procedures, and economic 
constraints in developing a dedicated endoscopy unit for children. Adult duodenoscopes used for endoscopic retrograde 
cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and echoendoscopes used 
for endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) have diameters that 
may compress the soft airways of young children. With the 
availability of pediatric scopes, diagnostic and therapeutic 
endoscopy has become easier and safer in infants and smaller 
children. The primary constraint with use of pediatric scopes 
is the smaller size/diameter of working channels, which may 
not allow the passage of many useful accessories. 
Another significant barrier in the growth of pediatric GI 
endoscopy includes economic constraints, which may hamper 
the establishment of a dedicated endoscopy suite for children, 
and a majority of centers utilize endoscopy suites, which have 
been designed for adults. Moreover, advanced therapeutic 
procedures are less commonly performed in pediatric patients 
compared to adults, further emphasizing the cost-issues of 
setting up a pediatric endoscopy unit. 
The need for advanced GI endoscopic procedures cannot 
be underestimated in pediatric patients. These procedures poReceived: June 16, 2017 Revised: September 2, 2017

tentially minimize morbidities associated with several surgical 
procedures and are useful in diseases such as chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic fluid collections (PFCs), and achalasia cardia 
(AC). 
Our subsequent discussion will focus on recent advancements in state-of-the-art therapeutic GI endoscopic procedures in the pediatric population.
Pre-procedural considerations 
in children – sedation and scopes 
There are two unique issues that demand attention prior to 
considering any endoscopic intervention in children. The first 
issue is selection of scopes and the second is type of sedation 
to be used. Unlike in adults, the selection of various endoscopes is based on the size of children. Similarly, a significant 
proportion of children require general anesthesia in contrast 
to adults where most therapeutic endoscopic procedures can 
be performed under conscious sedation or deep sedation. 
With the availability of pediatric duodenoscopes (outer diameter of 7.5 mm), the size of children usually does not hinder successful outcomes of an ERCP performed in children. 
Several studies describe the successful use of adult duodenoscopes (outer diameter of 11.3–11.6 mm) in children. A primary advantage associated with use of an adult duodenoscope 
is its wider channel (up to 4.2 mm), which allows the use of 
accessories that might not be compatible with pediatric duodenoscopes. Pediatric duodenoscopes (outer diameter of 7.5 
mm) do not allow passage of triple lumen sphincterotomes 
and stents larger than 5 Fr. The guidelines established by the 
European Society of Gastroenterology (ESGE) and the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and 
Nutrition (ESPGHAN) recommend pediatric duodenoscopes 
with an outer diameter of 7.5 mm for children weighing <10 
kg and adult duodenoscopes in those weighing >10 kg.1,2
With regard to EUS, commercially available EUS scopes 
(outer diameter of 11–14 mm) limit the use of EUS in infants 
and small children. Additionally, the stiff distal tip of the scope 
increases the risk of cervical esophageal perforation. ESGE/
ESPGHAN guidelines recommend the use of endobronchial 
ultrasonography in children weighing <15 kg.3
The second issue is the type of sedation used to perform endoscopic procedures in children. Advanced therapeutic procedures like ERCP and EUS may have an unpredictably long 
procedure time. Additionally, small children and infants have 
soft airways and therefore present a higher risk of compression by scopes. The risk of hypoxia is further exacerbated by 
the prone position, which is often used during an ERCP. The 
recently published ESGE/ESPGHAN guidelines suggest use 
of general anesthesia with tracheal intubation for an ERCP or 
EUS performed in children. Deep/conscious sedation without 
tracheal intubation may be considered for children >12 years 
of age.2

Endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography in 
children
The procedure of ERCP has increased manifolds over 
the last few decades in children. An increasing body of evidence supports the safety and efficacy of ERCP in children 
(Table 1).4-13 An ERCP is performed in children primarily for 
pancreatico-biliary indications such as biliary obstruction, 
chronic pancreatitis, recurrent acute pancreatitis, choledochal cysts, trauma, and sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. The 
therapeutic success of ERCP in large pediatric case series was 
demonstrated to be >90% with a complication rate of approximately 5%–10%. Therefore, the efficacy and safety rates of an 
ERCP performed in children are comparable to adults. 
The most convincing evidence of the efficacy of ERCP 
exists with respect to chronic pancreatitis in children.10,14 A 
recent study has revealed that complete and partial pain relief 
was achieved in 63.6% and 21.6% of children, respectively 
after endotherapy was performed.10 Extracorporeal shock 
wave lithotripsy (ESWL) has also been shown to be safe and 
effective in children with pancreatic ductal calculi (Fig. 1). 
ESWL is usually performed for large pancreatic ductal calculi 
(≥5 mm). Complete clearance of calculi was achieved in 86% 
of children in whom ERCP was performed after an ESWL.15
Mild post-ERCP pancreatitis was the most common adverse 
event observed after the ESWL procedure. 
The safety of ERCP has been evaluated in several recent 
studies.10,16,17 A recent systematic review and meta-analysis 
has shown a pooled complication rate of 6% (95% confidence 
interval 4%–8%) including post-ERCP pancreatitis (4.7%), 
bleeding (0.6%), and infections (0.8%).17 The risk factors 
for post-ERCP pancreatitis in children include injection of 
contrast into the pancreatic duct and pancreatic sphincterotomy.18 Cho et al., analyzed the adverse events and long-term 
outcomes associated with an endoscopic sphincterotomy in 
a pediatric population.16 In this retrospective study, early adverse events (<30 days) included pancreatitis (5.7%), bleeding 
(2.0%), sepsis (1.0%), and perforations (0.7%). Long-term adverse events (>30 days) including cholangitis and minor papilla restenosis were noticed in 6.1% of children.16 Post-ERCP 
pancreatitis is the most common adverse event as mentioned 
above. Unlike adults, there are no studies specifically addressing this issue, and strategies to prevent post-ERCP pancreatitis 
are unclear in children. However, expert guidelines from 
ESPGHAN and ESGE recommend the use of nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs such as diclofenac/indomethacin 
suppositories for the prophylaxis of post-ERCP pancreatitis 
in children older than 14 years.2
 There appears to be significant heterogeneity in published literature with respect to the 
reported prevalence of adverse events. This may be due to differences in types of cases, operator’s experience, and the definition used to describe adverse events. Unfortunately, there is 
no accepted definition to grade the severity of adverse events 
in the pediatric population. This is in contrast to adults where 
a standard grading system exists and is widely utilized across 
studies. 
ERCP is a technically demanding procedure compared to 
an upper or lower GI endoscopy. Additionally, the potential 
for complications is higher and therefore, careful patient 
selection is paramount. With the availability of excellent 
non-invasive imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance

cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), a therapeutic ERCP is 
preferred over a diagnostic procedure and is commonly performed to minimize the associated complications. 
ENDOSCOPIC ULTRASONOGRAPHY IN
CHILDREN
EUS is being increasingly used for both diagnostic and 
therapeutic indications. Emerging data suggests excellent safety and efficacy of EUS in the pediatric age group (Table 2).19-26
EUS has been utilized in children predominantly for diagnostic indications in various pancreatico-biliary disorders. This is 
in contrast to adults in whom EUS is being increasingly used 
as a therapeutic modality. Indications of a diagnostic EUS in 
children include evaluation of idiopathic recurrent pancreatitis, tissue sampling or pancreatic cyst aspiration for analysis, 
suspected choledocholithiasis, submucosal lesions (esophageal, 
gastric, rectal), and congenital disorders (esophageal stenosis, 
tracheobronchial remnants, duodenal duplication cysts).27-29
EUS has also been used for assessing portal hypertension and 
performing a liver biopsy when required.30
The advantages of EUS include a high axial resolution for 
accurate evaluation of the pancreatico-biliary system and the 
ability to sample the lesion (fine-needle aspiration or core needle biopsy) when required. Therefore, EUS scores over other 
imaging modalities like MRCP, contrast computed tomography (CT) and transabdominal ultrasonography in situations 
where tissue sampling may be necessary. Moreover, an MRCP 
requires patient cooperation, transabdominal ultrasonography 
is associated with limitations in terms of not always facilitating visualization of the distal common bile duct, and contrast 
CT is associated with radiation exposure. EUS can confirm 
the presence or absence of choledocholithiasis and avoid unnecessary ERCPs. However, an ERCP can be performed at 
the same time using the same sedation after confirmation of 
common bile duct calculi. A recent study wherein EUS was 
performed in 20 children with suspected bile duct calculi, 
EUS confirmed the absence of calculi in 13 children in whom 
ERCP could be avoided.25
The therapeutic use of EUS in children is limited and includes drainage of PFC, biliary drainage, and performing a 
celiac plexus block. EUS-guided drainage of PFC is safe and 
efficacious in children and is associated with reduced morbidity compared to percutaneous and surgical drainage. The 
advantages of EUS-guided drainage compared to non-EUSguided endoscopic drainage include the fact that the optimal 
site for drainage can be chosen and intervening vessels can 
be avoided. Additionally, it facilitates effective drainage of 
non-bulging collections.31
Recently, Nabi et al. evaluated the long-term outcomes of 
EUS-guided drainage of PFCs in 30 children.32 This study 
involved EUS-guided placement of one or more cystogastric double pigtail plastic stents. EUS-guided drainage was

successfully completed in 29 children (96.7% technical success). All the drainage procedures were effectively carried 
out under deep sedation using an intravenous injection of 
propofol. Clinical success was achieved in 28/30 (93.3%) 
children. Plastic stents were not removed in children with 
a disconnected pancreatic duct. Using this approach, only 
two recurrences of PFC were noticed at median follow-up 
of 829 days (range, 150–1,230 days).32 A few other small 
series of studies involving pediatric patients have also concluded that EUS-guided drainage of PFC in children is safe 
and associated with good outcomes.33-35 Plastic stents have a 
smaller caliber and may get clogged easily in cases of walledoff necrosis which have debris present inside. In such cases, 
specially designed metal stents have proven their ‘mettle’ 
with excellent results in multiple large series of studies performed in adults.36-39 The advantages of new dedicated metal 
stents include a wider lumen, which allows efficient drainage 
and endoscopic necrosectomy. These stents are fully covered, 
which prevents tissue in-growth and allows easy removal. 
Moreover, these stents are either bi-flanged (Nagi stent; Taewoong Medical Co, Goyang, Korea) or have lumen-apposing properties (Axios stent; Xlumena, Mountain View, CA, 
USA) that help to reduce migration rates.36 More recently, 
the use of novel self-expanding metal stents has also been 
described in children with walled-off necrosis (Fig. 2).40,41
In a retrospective study, 21 children (mean age, 14.9 +/– 
2.34 years, 9–18 years) with walled-off necrosis underwent 
EUS-guided drainage using metal stents. The technical and 
clinical success rates were observed to be 100% and 95%, 
respectively.41 None of the children enrolled in this study required endoscopic necrosectomy. In a few other case reports, 
necrosectomy has been reported in children with walled-off 
necrosis.42,43
The safety of EUS-guided drainage has been established in 
adults and major adverse events are uncommon. However, 
data are limited in children and a greater number of studies 
are required to establish the safety of endoscopic drainage of 
PFC in the pediatric population. Major complications that 
have been described include bleeding, perforation, and infection. A recent study performed in a pediatric population reported three major adverse events noticed during endoscopic 
drainage of PFC. These included occurrence of bleeding 
requiring arterial embolization in one and perforation in two 
children of which one required surgery (cystogastrostomy).32
Therefore, it is important that endoscopic drainage procedures 
in children should be performed by experts at well-equipped 
centers with availability of a multidisciplinary team including 
surgeons and interventional radiologists for timely intervention in cases of emergencies.

Per-oral endoscopic myotomy in 
children 
AC is a rare neurodegenerative disorder resulting in 
aperistalsis and defective lower esophageal sphincter (LES) 
relaxation,44 showing an incidence of 0.1–0.18/105 population/
year in the pediatric age group.45 The mainstay of endoscopic 
management is pneumatic balloon dilatation. However, the 
response after balloon dilatation is often short lived and repeated sessions of dilatation are frequently required. 
Per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) has evolved as an 
outstanding endoscopic treatment modality for the management of AC. Multiple large case series have established the 
safety and efficacy of POEM in adults diagnosed with AC.46,47
Data in children is limited to small case series and case reports.45,48-50 Nevertheless, the outcome of POEM in these case 
series is encouraging (Table 3).
Existing literature suggests that the procedure can be safely performed in an endoscopy suite in adults as well as in 
children.51,52 Equipment and accessories required for POEM 
include a gastroscope equipped with a water jet, a tapered 
tip transparent cap fitted on the distal end of the scope, an 
electrosurgical unit, a carbon dioxide (CO2) insufflator, a low 
flow gas tube, coagulation forceps, an electrosurgical knife, 
and endoscopic clips.
POEM is performed under general anesthesia with the 
patient in a supine position. The technique of POEM involves 
a series of steps: (1) mucosal injection to raise a bleb, (2) muTable 3. Studies Depicting the Outcomes of Per-Oral Endoscopic Myotomy in Children

cosal incision using a needle knife, (3) submucosal tunneling 
using an electrosurgical knife (triangular or hybrid knife), (4) 
myotomy using the same knives, and (5) closure of the mucosal incision using endoclips (Fig. 3). Authors have previously 
described this procedure in detail in a video format.53
The clinical success rate of POEM in pediatric patients presenting with achalasia ranges from 90%–100% (Table 3).45,49-51,54
In a retrospective study, Nabi et al. evaluated the outcomes of 
POEM in 15 children with AC.45 Significant improvement was 
noticed in mean LES pressures (36.64±11.08 mm Hg vs. 15.65±5.73 
mm Hg), Eckardt scores (7.32±1.42 and 1.74±0.67) and barium 
emptying after POEM.45 Unfortunately, no long-term follow-up 
study has been performed in children in contrast to adults diagnosed with AC. A study performed with a relatively long-term 
follow-up (24.6 months, range, 15–38 months) has reported 
clinical success in all children evaluated.49
POEM is a safe procedure when performed by experts. 
Most complications are minor in nature and can be easily 
managed intraoperatively. Adverse events associated with 
POEM include insufflations-related complications (capnoperitoneum, capnothorax, capnomediastinum), mucosal injuries, 
and bleeding. The incidence of insufflation-related adverse 
events is higher if air is used for insufflation instead of CO2
because the latter has a higher diffusion capacity. A prospective study has reported that the incidence of gas-related adverse events was significantly higher with use of air compared 
to CO2 (84.6% vs. 16.7%, p<0.04).49
With innovations in the development of new devices and 
techniques, the procedure may become easier and less time 
consuming. A recent study evaluated the efficacy of a new 
triangular tip knife equipped with a water jet function in 
pediatric patients. Authors concluded that the procedure was 
technically easier, and the time required to complete the procedure was shorter than that observed in the conventional 
triangular knife group.51
Based on the available data, it can be concluded that 
POEM is a promising treatment modality that can be used 
in pediatric patients, although further prospective studies 
with a larger sample size are required to conclusively establish its usefulness. Additionally, comparative studies with 
established treatment modalities such as Heller’s myotomy 
and pneumatic balloon dilatation are essential to conclusively establish the role of POEM in pediatric patients presenting 
with AC.
Conclusions
The horizon of therapeutic GI endoscopy in children is 
now expanding. Because most procedures have been adapted 
from adults, devices and accessories have not been designed 
specifically for use in children. For this same reason, a large 
proportion of advanced endoscopic procedures in the pediatric age group continue to be performed by gastroenterologists operating in the adult domain. The size of adult scopes 
may be disproportionate for smaller airways in children and 
demand general anesthesia in a large proportion of cases 
compared to adults. The indications of advanced endoscopic 
procedures are different and fewer in children compared 
to adults, thereby explaining the slow development of the 
same in children. Newer devices suitable for pediatric use are 
required. It seems prudent to propose that a formal training 
program should be introduced to train pediatric gastroenterologists in these procedures. Until then pediatric and adult 
gastroenterologists can work in collaboration to optimize the 
outcomes of advanced endoscopic procedures performed in 
children.
