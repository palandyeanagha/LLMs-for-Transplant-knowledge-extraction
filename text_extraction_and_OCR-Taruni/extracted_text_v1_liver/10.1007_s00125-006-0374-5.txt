Abstract
Aims/hypothesis The Edmonton Protocol for islet transplantation has provided hope for type 1 diabetic patients.
However, this protocol requires lifelong immunosuppression, specifically sirolimus, a cellular antiproliferate. The
effect of sirolimus on human pancreatic ductal cells (HDCs)
is not known. This may be important since HDCs are
believed to be islet precursors. Since neonatal porcine islets
(NPIs), which contain many ductal precursor cells, could be
a potential clinical source of islets, we also tested the effects
of sirolimus on this tissue.
Methods HDCs (n=4), NPIs (n=9) and human islets (n=5)
were cultured with and without sirolimus (20 ng/ml) for 6 days.
Results HDCs and NPIs cultured with sirolimus showed a 50
and 28% decrease, respectively, in cell number relative to
control (p<0.05). Control cultures expanded 1.65- and 2.44-
fold relative to time 0. Decreases in cell number of
sirolimus-treated HDCs were not due to apoptosis as
measured by TUNEL staining. No functional effects on
human islets or NPIs were observed following static
incubation with high glucose. Treatment of syngeneically
transplanted and naïve BALC/c mice with sirolimus resulted
in altered OGTT profiles with prolonged elevation of
hyperglycaemia and weight gain. There was no difference
in graft and organ insulin content between treatment groups.
Conclusions/interpretation Our results indicate that sirolimus decreases ductal cell numbers in culture and alters
glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in vivo. The administration of sirolimus to islet transplant recipients is likely to
impair graft function as a result of decreasing ductal
neogenesis and induction of insulin resistance.

Introduction
The clinical success of islet transplantation has provided an
effective treatment for type 1 diabetic patients [1, 2]. Key
elements for this success are the immunosuppressive
protocol and transplantation of sufficient islet cell mass.

transplant recipients to prevent islet graft rejection [3].
While this cocktail is free of steroidal drugs, which are
known to have diabetogenic side effects [2], these agents
may still affect the long-term function and survival of
human islet grafts.
Several studies have investigated the effects of these
immunosuppressive agents on beta cell function in human
cell lines [4], rodent beta cells [5] and human beta cells [6–
8]. These studies have shown that high doses of tacrolimus
and sirolimus can cause significant exocytosis of cellular
insulin [4], inhibition of insulin secretion upon stimulation
by glucose [5, 8] and induction of apoptosis in both beta
and alpha cells [6]. A recent clinical update of patients with
long-term islet grafts shows that graft function diminishes
over a 5-year period [1], necessitating exogenous insulin
administration for the maintenance of tight glycaemic
control. Graft function as demonstrated by persistent Cpeptide secretion is maintained, but the amount of insulin
generated by the graft is no longer sufficient to maintain
euglycaemia in the absence of usually small amounts of
supplemental injected insulin. This reduction in insulin
production may be the result of beta cell death coupled with
impaired beta cell regeneration.
Finegood et al. [9] reported that the average life span of
a beta cell is 1 to 3 months. Therefore dynamic beta cell
turnover occurs within the pancreas to maintain a critical
mass of functional beta cells. This also suggests that beta
cell turnover occurs within islet grafts to maintain longterm function after transplantation. The source of pancreatic
beta cell progenitor cells remains unknown. Using a genetic
lineage tracing approach, Dor et al. reported that adult
pancreatic beta cells are formed by self-duplication rather
than differentiation from an undifferentiated stem cell [10].
Others have suggested that pancreatic ductal cells can serve
as multipotent progenitor cells and that external stimuli can
direct the differentiation of these cells to endocrine, acinar,
or mature ductal cell phenotypes [11–15]. Other investigators have shown that the population of bone marrow or
spleen cells may contain stem cells that can differentiate
into beta cells [16–18].
The working hypothesis of our group is that ductal
cells are the beta cell progenitors within the pancreas,
contributing via neogenesis to the generation of new
beta cells. We have recently shown that islet recipients
who receive greater numbers of ductal cells within islet
grafts have better graft function at 2 years post
transplant as measured by acute insulin response to
glucose [19]. Since ductal progenitors within the grafts
may contribute to long-term graft function, it is important
to determine the effect of immunosuppressive agents on
these cells. Indeed, long-term immunosuppression may
reduce graft function either by direct drug effects on the
beta cells themselves or by effects on ductal cell
progenitors that are transplanted with the islets (ductal
cells form 20–30% of islet grafts) [19].
Sirolimus is a non-specific antiproliferative drug administered to patients receiving islet grafts. Sirolimus inhibits
the clonal expansion of activated lymphocytes by interacting with the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR),
inhibiting progression from the G1 to the S phase of the cell
cycle [20]. Since the proteins bound by sirolimus are not
unique to T cells, it is possible that sirolimus exerts this
antiproliferative effect on other cell types. Studies have
shown that sirolimus inhibits proliferation of coronary
artery smooth muscles, hepatic stellate cells, small lung
cancer cells, mouse proximal tubular cells and pancreatic
cancer cells [21–25]. If sirolimus inhibits the proliferation
of pancreatic duct cells or even existing beta cells within
the islet grafts, this drug may impede new beta cell
formation and thus limit graft longevity and function.
In the present study we have evaluated the effect of
sirolimus on the function and proliferation of human
pancreatic ductal cells (HDCs) and human islet cells. We
have also tested the effects of sirolimus on neonatal porcine
islets (NPIs). NPIs constitute a potential source of cells for
clinical transplantation because of their inherent ability for
proliferation and differentiation [26]. Recently, we provided
the first evidence that allogeneic NPIs can reverse diabetes
in a large animal model [27, 28].
Materials and methods
Study ethics
All experimental protocols used in this study were
approved by the Research Ethics Board of the University
of Alberta.
Cell preparation
Human
Human pancreases were removed from cadaveric donors,
who had previously given informed consent, and processed
according to previously described protocols [29]. Briefly,
pancreata were stored in chilled University of Wisconsin
solution before islet isolation. Islet isolation, gradient
purification and tissue collection was performed as previously described for human islets [2, 30]. For the in vitro
insulin secretion experiments fresh (n=3) or cryopreserved
(n=2) (donor ages 24–64 years) human islets were cultured
in non-tissue-culture-treated plates for 2 to 3 days with
RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco/Invitrogen, Burlington, ON,
Canada) + insulin–transferrin–selenium (ITS)/BSA with
10% FCS prior to experimentation.
2342 Diabetologia (2006) 49:2341–2349

Following islet purification, the ductal/acinar fraction
was collected and washed three times with Hanks’ balanced
salt solution (HBSS; Mediatech Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville,
ON, Canada) supplemented with 0.5% BSA (fraction V;
Sigma). This fraction (n=4; donor ages 11–67 years) was
cultured in suspension for 4 to 6 days with RPMI 1640
medium supplemented with 1% ITS/0.5% BSA. Medium
was exchanged at day 1 post culture and every 2 days
thereafter. At the end of the culture period these preparations are composed of 68% cytokeratin (CK)-19, 16%
amylase, and 1% beta cells [31].
Pig
The isolation method for NPIs has been described [26].
Briefly, pancreases from Landrace–Yorkshire neonatal pigs
(1–3 days old, 1.5–2.0 kg body weight) were removed and
digested in 2.5 mg/ml of collagenase (Sigma). After
filtration (500 μm), cells were cultured for 6 days in HAMs
F10 medium (Gibco) containing 10 mmol/l glucose, 50 μm
isobutylmethylxanthine (ICN Biomedicals, Montreal, QC,
Canada), 0.5% BSA, 2 mmol/l L-glutamine, 10 mmol/l
nicotinamide (BDH Biochemical, Poole, UK), 100 IU/ml
penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The medium was
replaced every second day. After this culture period, the
NPIs are routinely composed of 35% endocrine and 57%
ductal endocrine precursor (CK7-positive) cells [26].
Mouse
Islets were isolated from BALB/c mice (purchased from The
Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA); pancreases were
distended with collagenase solution (1 mg/ml), surgically
removed and digested. Following dextran gradient centrifugation, islets were picked off gradient interfaces, washed with
HBSS and cultured overnight in Hams F10 [32].
Cell expansion and characterisation
After isolation and 4 to 6 days of culture [31] HDCs were
cultured at ∼1.5×105 cells/well with and without 10 or
20 ng/ml sirolimus (Rapamune; Wyeth-Canada Laboratories, Markham, ON, Canada). NPIs (535 aggregates/well)
were cultured as experimental cultures with 20 ng/ml of
sirolimus added to the base media or as control cultures
grown in base media alone. All cells were cultured in 12-
well tissue-culture-treated plates with RPMI 1640 (Gibco)
and HEPES buffer, sodium pyruvate, 100 IU/ml penicillin,
100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10% FBS, 2-beta-mercaptoethanol
and 20 ng/ml endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast
growth factor (Invitrogen) to induce cell proliferation. Cell
preparations were assessed for cell number by measuring
DNA content at time 0 and day 6 of culture. We have
previously shown that human islet cells contain 6.6 pg
DNA/cell [31] whereas NPI cells have 7.1 pg DNA/cell
[26]. Cellular insulin content and cellular composition of
the NPI cultures were also characterised at these timepoints.
Cell characterisation
To determine cell number, aliquots of the cell suspension
were measured in triplicate for total cellular DNA content
using a fluorometric assay (Hoefer DyNa Quant 200;
Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, San Francisco, CA, USA)
as described previously [26]. Insulin content was measured
after cellular extraction by RIA (porcine) or by ELISA
(human) [26].
The cellular composition of NPI and HDC cultures was
determined by immunohistochemistry using the avidin–
biotin complex–3,3 diaminobenzidinetetrahydrochloride
method. Briefly, cellular aggregates were dissociated into
single cell suspensions and adhered to histobond slides
(Marienfeld Glassware, Bad Mergentheim, Germany).
Slides were fixed in Bouin’s fixative for 12 min before
storage at 4°C in 70% ethanol. Cells were quenched with
20% H2O2/methanol followed by microwave antigen
retrieval for CK 7 and 19 in sodium citrate. Primary
antibody concentrations were as follows: 1/1,000 guinea
pig anti-porcine insulin (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), 1/50
mouse anti-human CK19 (Dako), 1/200 mouse anti-human
CK7 (Dako). Antibodies to CK7 and 19 were used as
markers for pancreatic ductal epithelial-type cells as
previously described [33]. All biotinylated secondary antibodies were obtained from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA, USA) and used at a concentration of 1/200.
Single cell counts were performed on 500 cells per sample
and percentages calculated.
Apoptosis in control and sirolimus-treated HDCs was
quantified using TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labelling
(TUNEL) staining. Single cells were adhered to histobond
slides and fixed as described above. Cells were stained for
CK19 to identify ductal cells using mouse anti-human
CK19 (1:25; Dako) and labelled using Cy3-conjugated antimouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West
Grove, PA, USA). Next, the apoptotic nuclei were labelled
with fluorescein isothiocyanate-dUTP (Roche, Laval, Quebec, Canada) using the TdT enzyme (Deadend Fluorometric
TUNEL System; Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The
stained slides were analysed using fluorescent microscopy
and cells were counted as described above.
Islet secretory activity
Human islets and NPIs were suspension-cultured in 79-cm2
dishes with 10 ml of RPMI + ITS/BSA, 10% FCS (human
islets) or Hams F10 (NPIs), with 20 ng/ml of sirolimus
Diabetologia (2006) 49:2341–2349 2343

included in experimental cultures. Control samples were
cultured in base media. All cultures were maintained at
37°C (5% CO2, 95% air) in humidified air for 6 days, with
medium changed every second day. Samples were taken at
day 0 and day 6 for analysis of DNA and insulin content,
glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and immunohistochemical composition.
Human islet and NPI secretory response to glucose
were determined using static incubation assay [34]. Islet
cell aliquots were washed with Hams F10 media without
glucose and incubated for 120 min in 1.5 ml of Hams
media with either 2.8 or 20 mmol/l glucose. The supernatant was then sampled and assayed for insulin using ELISA
(human) or RIA (porcine). The insulin content of the
supernatant was expressed as a percentage of the total
content (i.e. tissue plus medium). Stimulation indices were
calculated by dividing the amount of insulin released
at 20 mmol/l glucose by that released at 2.8 mmol/l
glucose [26].
In vivo studies
Effect of sirolimus on mouse islet graft function
We transplanted 500 mouse islets that had been cultured for
1 day under the left kidney capsule of halothane-anaesthetised diabetic BALB/c mice (The Jackson Laboratory).
Diabetes (glycaemia >8.4 mmol/l) was induced using
275 mg/kg body weight of streptozotocin (Sigma) injected
intraperitoneally 2 days prior to transplantation. Transplanted
mice were randomly separated into two groups control
(untreated) and experimental (sirolimus-treated). Sirolimus
treatment consisted of daily i.p. injection of 0.2 mg/kg
sirolimus commencing the day after transplant and continuing for 26 days. Blood glucose levels were monitored
weekly between 08:00 and 11:00 hours. An OGTT [26] was
performed 48 h prior to graft removal on recipients that had
achieved normoglycaemia (blood glucose ≤8.4 mmol/l).
After a 6-h fast, a bolus of 50% dextrose (3 mg/g body
weight) was administered intragastrically to non-anaesthetised mice. Tail vein blood samples were obtained at 0, 15,
30, 60, 90 and 120 min. Nephrectomy of the graft-bearing
kidney was performed and the insulin content of the graft
was determined after organ extraction by RIA.
Effect of sirolimus on native pancreatic islet function
Naïve BALB/c mice were divided into control (n=11) and
experimental (n=11) groups. Experimental animals received
a daily i.p. injection of sirolimus (0.2 mg/kg) for 26 days as
detailed above and control animals received daily injections
of saline. Blood glucose was monitored weekly and OGTT
tests were performed at day 26 to assess pancreatic islet
function. Pancreases were removed 48 h post-OGTT and
organs assayed for insulin content. In a subset of animals
(n=4), whole blood was collected post-OGTT into EDTAtreated tubes via cardiac puncture and sirolimus content
was measured by RIA.
Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as mean±SEM of n independent
observations. Statistical significance was calculated with a
two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test or a one-way ANOVA
in the case of multiple comparisons.
Results
Sirolimus inhibits proliferation of human pancreatic ductal
cells and NPIs
Monolayers of HDCs were cultured for 6 days in medium
containing no sirolimus (control) and either 10 or 20 ng/ml
sirolimus. Human ductal cells cultured in control media
showed a 1.65-fold expansion (increase in cell number)
relative to time 0, while in sirolimus-treated HDCs
expansion was inhibited and cell number relative to time
0 decreased (Fig. 1). With sirolimus treatment, cell
expansion was inhibited relative to control by 53% with
10 ng/ml and 50% with 20 ng/ml sirolimus (p<0.05). A
dose of 20 ng/ml sirolimus was maintained in subsequent
experiments, based upon the target trough levels in human
islet transplantation (12–15 ng/ml for the first 3 months and
7–10 ng/ml thereafter) and in vivo experimental models [1,
2]. Decreases in the cell number of sirolimus-treated HDCs

were not due to drug-induced cell death as measured by
TUNEL staining for apoptosis following 6 days of drug
treatment. Control cultures showed that 19.27±3.52% (n=2)
of CK19-positive ductal cells were undergoing apoptosis,
compared with 17.55±7.05% (n=2) of CK19 cells in
sirolimus-treated cells.
Monolayers of NPIs were cultured on tissue-culturetreated plates for 6 days in medium containing no sirolimus
(control), or 20 ng/ml sirolimus. NPIs expanded in number
under both control and sirolimus treatment conditions
relative to time 0 (Table 1). Control-treated samples showed
a 2.44±0.62-fold increase and sirolimus-treated samples a
1.77±0.59-fold increase in cell number relative to time 0.
Relative to control cultures, sirolimus treatment significantly reduced cell number to 28% of control (p<0.05).
Examination of cell composition showed that there was
differential expansion of cell types; with a decrease in
insulin-positive cells after 6 days of culture and an increase
in CK7-positive ductal cells regardless of treatment
(Table 1).
Sirolimus does not alter in vitro function of human
islets or NPIs
The secretory activity of human islets cultured in the
presence or absence of 20 ng/ml sirolimus was tested by
comparing the percentages of cellular insulin that were
released at low glucose (2.8 mmol/l) and high glucose
(20 mmol/l). No statistically significant differences were
noticed in the amounts of insulin secreted at low and
high glucose between treatment groups. The stimulation
index, a measure of islet responsiveness to glucose, was
not significantly different in samples at time 0, or in
control- or sirolimus-treated human samples (Table 2).
Stimulation indices of control- and sirolimus-treated cultures were 3.51±1.91 (n=5) and 2.40±0.65 (n=5), respectively, which was slightly, though not significantly, elevated
against time 0 values, 1.42±0.12 (n=4).
The insulin secretory activity of NPIs cultured for
6 days in suspension with medium containing 20 ng/ml
sirolimus was not different from controls (Table 2).
Stimulation indices of control and sirolimus-treated cultures
were 3.01±0.86 and 1.98±0.33, respectively, which was not
statistically different from time 0 values of 1.96±0.34.
Sirolimus impairs the function of syngeneic BALB/c mouse
islet grafts and innate pancreatic islets
To examine the effect of sirolimus in vivo, BALB/c mouse
islets were implanted beneath the kidney capsule of diabetic
BALB/c mice and sirolimus treatment was administered as
described (see ‘Methods’ section). Sirolimus had no effect
on the daily blood glucose of animals, and animals in both
treatment groups were normoglycaemic by 1 week post
transplantation (Fig. 2). OGTT tests demonstrated that mice
that received daily injections of sirolimus had elevated

blood glycaemia at 15, 30 and 60 min post bolus
administration of dextrose compared to controls. At
60 min this trend was statistically significant (p<0.05)
(Fig. 2). Insulin content of grafts by organ extraction
showed decreased insulin content in sirolimus-treated
animals. However, due to large variability, these differences
were not statistically significant. Control grafts yielded
90.88±47 (n=6) μg insulin/graft, whereas sirolimus-treated
grafts yielded 4.5±2.5 (n=6) μg insulin/graft.
To examine the effect of sirolimus on pancreatic islet
function, we injected naïve non-diabetic mice with
sirolimus (0.2 mg/kg, i.p.) daily for 26 days. Sirolimus
content of whole blood was 37.03±4.0 ng/ml following
the injection regime. We found no differences in daily
blood glucose levels (Fig. 3) or pancreatic insulin content
between sirolimus-treated and control mice. Pancreatic
organ extraction for insulin content yielded 27.15±2.9 μg/
pancreas in control-treated animals and 24.06±1.5 μg/
pancreas in sirolimus injected animals. OGTTs, however,
showed that at 30, 60, 90 and 120 min sirolimus-treated
mice had significantly higher blood glucose than controls at
matched timepoints (Fig. 3). Sirolimus-treated mice also
showed a tendency towards increased weight gain relative
to controls, with the difference between start and end
weights approaching significance (control 0.30±0.3, sirolimus 1.49±0.5; p=0.078).
Discussion
Prior to this study the effect of sirolimus on pancreatic
ductal cell proliferation was not known. We have evaluated
the effect of sirolimus on ductal cell expansion, islet
function and the in vivo function of islet grafts and
pancreas. We found that in HDCs and NPIs, which contain
57% ductal cells, cell expansion was inhibited by 50 and
33%, respectively, relative to untreated controls. These
results are not surprising since sirolimus interacts with the
FK506 binding protein intracellular binding proteins. The
sirolimus–FK506 binding protein complex binds directly
with mTOR and blocks its function. By inhibiting mTOR
function, the protein translation necessary for cell growth
and proliferation is inhibited and sirolimus halts the cell
cycle in the G1 phase [35]. We observed that porcine ductal
cells are more resilient to sirolimus than HDCs, a finding of
clinical importance for xenotransplantation. If porcine

tissue shows enhanced resilience to the negative effects of
immunosuppressive drugs such as sirolimus, the graft
longevity of porcine cells may be enhanced compared with
human cell equivalents.
We found that sirolimus-treated HDCs did not show
increased apoptosis relative to controls following 6 days of
drug treatment. Although we did not culture our cells with
[
3
H] thymidine, it has been shown that in human
preadipocytes sirolimus inhibits proliferation as measured
by this method [36]. The absence of elevated apoptosis in
our study, coupled with the absence of proliferation
reported by others [36], suggests that the decreased cell
number within our sirolimus-treated cultures is probably
primarily due to an inhibition of ductal proliferation. When
HDCs were cultured with sirolimus, cell viability decreased
to below that of time 0 (Fig. 1), indicating that sirolimus
treatment induced cellular toxicity possibly by an early
induction of apoptosis or necrotic cell death prior to day 6,
and thus was not detected when we assessed our cultures at
day 6. In addition to its anti-proliferative properties,
sirolimus has been shown by others to exhibit cellular
toxicity, with a reduction of islet viability as measured by
MTT and Calcein assay occurring at high concentrations
(100 ng/ml) [6].
Clinically, patients receiving higher numbers of ductal
cells have better long-term graft function despite sirolimus
treatment, indicating that the high number of ductal cells
present in islet grafts is sufficient to overcome the
antiproliferative effects of sirolimus. However, sustained
treatment with sirolimus may have an antiproliferative
effect that is sufficient to diminish graft function as
observed over time [1].
To study the systemic effects of sirolimus, mouse islets
were transplanted beneath the kidney capsule of diabetic
BALB/c mice. Sirolimus-induced changes were observed in
the OGTT profile, with mice showing elevated blood
glycaemia during the glucose challenge followed by a
return of levels to normal by the end of the test period.
The observed differences in OGTT profile may be due to
poor vasculature caused by inhibition of angiogenesis, altered
islet function resulting from ectopic transplantation, inhibition of islet function or reduced ductal proliferation. To
determine if differences were due to poor vasculature or
ectopic site, we treated naïve mice with daily injections of
sirolimus. These mice had normal daily blood glucose, but
also showed exacerbated changes in blood glucose regulation
upon OGTT testing. The sirolimus content of whole blood
from these mice was 37.03±4.0 ng/ml, which is higher than
the initial trough target levels of 10 to 12 ng/kg in human islet
transplant recipients. We feel, however, that the high levels of
sirolimus to which the animals are exposed may accurately
represent the high peak drug concentrations within the portal
circulation, to which human and large animal islet grafts are
exposed after being infused into the recipient liver [37].
Similar decreases in insulin response to glucose have been
reported in an allograft porcine model of islet transplantation
and in the clinical setting of patients who receive islet
transplantation [27, 38]. In both reports transplant recipients
received sirolimus as part of their immunosuppressive
regime and demonstrated elevated glucose following a
glucose challenge test.
The sustained hyperglycaemia observed during OGTT
testing, together with increased weight gain in sirolimustreated animals, suggests the initiation of insulin resistance
in these animals. Sirolimus decreases the phosphorylation
of serine 307 on IRS-1 in adipocytes, thereby inhibiting
efficient insulin signalling in human adipocytes and
mimicking what is seen with type 2 diabetes [39]. In our
work we did not observe any effect on GSIS in human or
porcine islets exposed to sirolimus in vitro. However,
altered OGTT profiles were observed in vivo when
sirolimus was administered to naïve mice and diabetic mice
transplanted with syngeneic islet grafts. It is likely that
sustained hyperglycaemia during OGTT testing resulted
from an inhibition of efficient signalling in the adipocyte,
leading to decreased efficiency of insulin-induced glucose
sequestration by the adipocyte. It is also known that
sirolimus inhibits insulin-induced synthesis of glycogen
and protein in muscle [40, 41], which may also contribute
to the sustained hyperglycaemia observed by us in vivo but
not in vitro upon hyperglycaemic challenge.
This study presents convincing evidence that sirolimus
inhibits the proliferation of pancreatic ductal cells and alters
GSIS in vivo. Therefore, by administering sirolimus to islet
transplant recipients, we are probably inhibiting long-term
graft function by decreasing ductal neogenesis and inducing
insulin resistance. Future work in this area will include the
investigation of new immunosuppressive drugs and tolerance induction protocols to replace the use of sirolimus for
effective immunosuppression. Indeed, there are many
promising new drugs, such as sphingosine-1-phosphate
receptor agonists or the costimulation inhibitor belatacept,
which are now undergoing clinical trial and which may
provide specific T cell inhibition with fewer diabetogenic
side effects [42, 43].
