Soon after the 1991 molecular cloning of hepatitis E virus (HEV), recombinant viral capsid
antigens were expressed and tested in nonhuman primates for protection against liver disease
and infection. Two genotype 1 subunit vaccine candidates entered clinical development: a
56 kDA vaccine expressed in insect cells and HEV 239 vaccine expressed in Escherichia coli.
Both were highly protective against hepatitis E and acceptably safe. The HEV 239 vaccine was
approved in China in 2011, but it is not yet prequalified by the World Health Organization, a
necessary step for introduction into those low- and middle-income countries where the
disease burden is highest. Nevertheless, the stage is set for the final act in the hepatitis E
vaccine story—policymaking, advocacy, and pilot introduction of vaccine in at-risk populations, in which it is expected to be cost-effective.
I
dentification of a novel virus pathogen that is
geographically dispersed, transmissible by the
fecal–oral route, responsible for massive disease
outbreaks, and capable of producing serious and
life-threatening illness in vulnerable populations invariably stimulates an effort to develop
prevention and control measures—first and
foremost being a prophylactic vaccine. Hepatitis
E virus (HEV) is such a pathogen. This review
describes the 35-year history of hepatitis E vaccine development from 1983 to 2017.
Our account begins with the identification
of an infectious virus-like particle (VLP) associated with enterically transmitted non-A, non-B
hepatitis that was unable to be propagated in
cultured cells. As molecular virology advanced,
the HEV RNA genome was cloned and sequenced. This enabled development of diagnostic methods to define its epidemiology. Two
hepatitis E vaccine candidates were invented,
and each produced using a different platform
for recombinant expression of a fragment of
the HEV capsid protein. These vaccine candidates were shown to be highly effective with acceptable safety; one is now licensed for use in
China. Nevertheless, vaccine prevention and
control of hepatitis E remains elusive, awaiting
generation of additional evidence that immunization programs in at-risk populations are suitable and cost-effective. We close with a discussion of the information gaps that exist and steps
that might be taken to make vaccination against
hepatitis E available to those who need it.
IMMUNITY TO HEV
Early studies of HEV infection and disease in
humans and animal models were hampered by
the lack of reference reagents and the necessity

to use immune electron microscopy to detect
virus or anti-HEV. Nevertheless, by 1988, Bradley and colleagues at the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) reported immune electron microscopy data (Bradley et al.
1988), showing that one antigenically related
class of viruses, visualized as antibody-coated
32-nm VLPs, is responsible for the majority of
human disease that was at the time termed enterically transmitted non-A, non-B hepatitis.
They used human stool suspensions containing
abundant 32-nm VLPs that were collected from
a patient with acute hepatitis in Tashkent, Uzbekistan and a patient in Telixtac, Mexico to
show that acute illness serum specimens from
numerous other patients with well-documented
non-A, non-B hepatitis in the USSR, Pakistan,
Nepal, Burma, Sudan, Somalia, and Mexico
contained immunoglobulins that bound to
these VLPs.
Following the determination of the first
complete RNA sequence of the HEV genome
(Tam et al. 1991), the complete RNA sequence
of another HEV isolate (SAR-55) from a hepatitis E outbreak in a secondary school located in
Sargodha, Pakistan was determined (Tsarev
et al. 1992) and used to produce recombinant
HEV antigens using a baculovirus expression
system. These enabled serologic tests for antiHEV to be developed (Tsarev et al. 1993) and
set the stage for a burst of epidemiologic field
studies to characterize humoral immunity to
HEV and preclinical studies to evaluate recombinant hepatitis E vaccine candidates.
ANIMAL MODELS TO EVALUATE IMMUNITY
Transmission of HEV from an infected human
volunteer to cynomolgus monkeys by intravenous inoculation of a virus-containing stool extract was first reported in 1983 (Balayan et al.
1983). This landmark report presented evidence
that 27- to 32-nm VLPs visualized by immune
electron microscopy in a pool of stool extracts
from patients with presumed acute enterically
transmitted non-A, non-B viral hepatitis caused
acute hepatitis after an incubation period of ∼35
days when administered orally to an adult
volunteer. A stool filtrate from that volunteer
collected 42 days postinoculation also contained
antigenically similar VLPs. This filtrate caused
acute hepatitis when administered intravenously to two cynomolgus monkeys; similar VLPs
were observed in the monkeys’ stool specimens
beginning 10 and 16 days after inoculation.
Transmission of acute hepatitis after an incubation period of several weeks by intravenous
inoculation of nonhuman primates with VLPcontaining stool filtrates was replicated repeatedly thereafter (Kane et al. 1984; Andjaparidze
et al. 1986; Bradley et al. 1987; Arankalle et al.
1988). The development of this nonhuman primate model of disease resulted in the generation
of virus-containing materials (feces, bile, and
liver) that enabled isolation of the first complementary DNA (cDNA) clone coding for a
portion of the HEV RNA genome (Reyes et al.
1990).
The first report of a hepatitis E vaccine candidate was published in 1993 by scientists at the
CDC who assessed protection of cynomolgus
macaques elicited by trpE-C2 protein, a trpEHEV fusion protein that represented the carboxyl two-thirds of the open reading frame 2
capsid protein ( pORF2) from a genotype (gt)1
HEV isolate (Burma) expressed in Escherichia
coli (Purdy et al. 1993). Two animals immunized thrice with the candidate were protected
from biochemical and histopathologic hepatitis
when challenged with HEV (Burma) or HEV
(Mexico). This pilot study was notable, as it offered the first evidence that vaccine prevention
of hepatitis E may be feasible.
An important advance came when investigators at the U.S. National Institutes of Health
(NIH) titrated the infectivity of the SAR-55
strain of HEV in cynomolgus macaques (Tsarev
et al. 1994a), thereby generating a virus stock
enabling reproducible challenge experiments
necessary for testing the efficacy of vaccine candidates. This group then produced a recombinant baculovirus-expressed pORF2 polypeptide
(initially termed a 55 kDa polypeptide, but subsequently characterized as a 56 kDa species),
purified it chromatographically, and adsorbed
it to aluminum hydroxide (AlOH) as a hepatitis
E vaccine candidate. Cynomolgus monkeys were
then administered saline placebo or the vaccine

candidate (one or two 50-µg doses 4 weeks
apart) and challenged intravenously with SAR55 HEV 4 weeks after immunization. All control
animals developed histopathologically confirmed hepatitis with HEV RNA detected in serum (viremia) and feces; all vaccinated animals
developed anti-HEV (reciprocal titers at the
time of challenge ranged from 100 to 10,000)
and were protected from hepatitis and viremia,
although animals receiving only a single vaccine
dose were infected as evidenced by detection of
HEV in feces, whereas animals receiving two
vaccine doses were not (Tsarev et al. 1994b).
The anti-HEV was optimally detected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using vaccine-homologous antigen. As part of the
same challenge experiment, four additional animals received late convalescent plasma from a
cynomolgus monkey that had been infected experimentally with a Chinese isolate of HEV,
having the same capsid protein amino acid sequence as SAR-55. These animals had anti-HEV
reciprocal titers of 40–200 when challenged, but
these levels decayed during the days immediately after virus challenge. Three of four animals
were protected from histopathologic signs of
hepatitis, but all four animals were infected as
manifested by serum viremia and multiweek excretion of HEV in feces.
PRECLINICAL EVIDENCE THAT IMMUNITY
TO A 56 kDa RECOMBINANT HEPATITIS E
VACCINE CANDIDATE CONFERS
HETEROLOGOUS PROTECTION
By 2001, an analysis of full length genomic sequences for HEV isolates collected from humans and animals on several continents clarified that HEV has evolved into at least four
antigenically related genotypes (Schlauder and
Mushahwar 2001): gt1 is represented by patient
isolates from Asia and North Africa, gt2 by patient isolates from Mexico and West Africa,
gt3 by patient and swine isolates from the United States and Europe, and gt4 by patient and
swine isolates from China (see Smith and Simmonds 2018). Initial vaccine discovery efforts
assessed candidate vaccines composed of polypeptides representing portions of pORF2 from
gt1 HEV isolates, as this genotype appears to be
responsible for the largest amount of human
disease.
The CDC vaccine candidate based on the gt1
Burma HEV isolate discussed above (Purdy et al.
1993) was not evaluated further, and was quickly supplanted by the NIH’s hepatitis E vaccine
development program, which reported protection data in 1994 (Tsarev et al. 1994a). The NIH
candidate was a recombinant capsid polypeptide from a different gt1 HEV (SAR-55, Pakistan) expressed in Sf9 cells of the fall armyworm,
Spodoptera frugiperda, using a baculovirus vector (Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus). The production and purification process for this 56 kDa HEV capsid protein vaccine
was further developed (Robinson et al. 1998)
and, by 1998, a vaccine lot suitable for investigational use in humans was manufactured. To
evaluate the breadth of protection afforded by
the 56 kDa HEV vaccine, immunized rhesus
monkeys were challenged via the intravenous
route 8 weeks after vaccination with 10,000
50% monkey-infective doses with SAR-55 (gt1,
vaccine homologous strain), Mex-14 (gt2, vaccine heterologous strain), and US-2 (gt3, vaccine heterologous strain). Two-dose vaccination
with either 1- or 10-µg doses afforded 100%
protection relative to control animals (immunized with hepatitis A vaccine) against hepatitis
(monitored by alanine aminotransferase levels
in serum) and 63%–84% protection against infection manifest as serum viremia (Purcell et al.
2003). The level of serum anti-HEV immunoglobin (Ig)G by ELISA using vaccine homologous antigen (SAR-55) was quantified in specimens collected before virus challenge. Results
were determined in World Health Organization
(WHO) units/mL, based on use of the WHO
Reference Reagent for HEV (The National Institute for Biological Standards and Control,
NIBSC code 95/584; see www.nibsc.org/
documents/ifu/95-584.pdf ). Fully protected animals (two-dose recipients) had a geometric
mean concentration (GMC) of anti-HEV IgG
of 483 WHO U/mL; partially protected animals
(one-dose recipients) had a GMC of 61 WHO
U/mL. These results provided important preclinical evidence that a gt1 recombinant hepatiImmunization against Hepatitis E

tis E vaccine could broadly protect humans
against hepatitis E.
NEUTRALIZING EPITOPES IN THE HEV
CAPSID PROTEIN
An important function of the humoral immune
response to viruses is virus neutralization. Detection of HEV replication in a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (PLC/PRF/5) over 3
weeks by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) created a means to detect virus neutralization in
vitro (Meng et al. 1997). Using this test, antibodies against an HEV recombinant “C2” protein
comprising the carboxy-terminal two-thirds
(225–660 aa) of the HEV Burma strain pORF2
capsid protein were shown to neutralize HEV
strains from Burma, Mexico, and Pakistan
(Meng et al. 1998). Subsequently, the location
of the neutralizing epitope in the capsid protein
was mapped using overlapping 30-mer synthetic peptides spanning the entire C2 protein and
31 overlapping recombinant proteins of different sizes derived from the entire Burma pORF2
to immunize mice (Meng et al. 2001). Immune
sera were tested by the in vitro neutralization
assay. Antibodies against synthetic peptides
and recombinant polypeptides <100 amino acids in length had no neutralizing activity, suggesting that the HEV neutralizing epitope is
conformational rather than linear. In line with
this observation, antibodies against recombinant proteins containing amino acids 452–617
showed cross-reactive HEV neutralizing activity, supporting the concept that the neutralizing
epitope resides within this carboxyl-terminal
portion of the capsid protein. This work was
extended when two monoclonal antibodies
that neutralized HEV were used to identify a
subregion of the ORF2 capsid protein spanning
amino acids 459–607 as the shortest peptide to
form the corresponding neutralization epitopes
(Zhou et al. 2004). An ELISA that was based on a
recombinant protein spanning amino acids
458–607 in ORF2 of the SAR-55 strain (gt1)
was efficient in detecting anti-HEV in nonhuman primates that had been experimentally infected with HEV gt1, gt2, gt3, or gt4 (Zhou et al.
2004). These data indicate that HEV exists as a
single serotype despite the characterization of
four phylogenetically distinct genotypes, and
imply that immunity elicited by a vaccine containing a fragment of the gt1 ORF2 capsid protein comprising the carboxyl-terminal neutralization epitope will be cross-protective.
IMMUNITY TO HEV IN HUMANS
The development of an HEV ELISA (SAR-55
strain) enabled sero-epidemiology studies to be
conducted, including a retrospective study of the
outbreak in Pakistan that yielded the SAR-55
strain (Bryan et al. 1994). There were two critical
observations in that outbreak study. The first
was that hepatitis E in young adults is the outcome of a primary HEV infection, as anti-HEV
IgM was detected in virtually every case. More
importantly, the presence of anti-HEV IgG was
correlated with resistance to hepatitis E. Among
contacts of patients with hepatitis E, 33% of
those with neither anti-HEV IgM nor IgG
when initially studied were later hospitalized
with hepatitis E. In contrast, no individuals
with anti-HEV IgG but without IgM were later
hospitalized.
An ELISA to quantitate total Ig to HEV,
using the 56 kDa capsid protein expressed by
recombinant baculovirus in insect cells as the
immunoassay antigen, was validated in anticipation of its use to assess the immunogenicity of
recombinant hepatitis E vaccine in clinical trials
(Innis et al. 2002). The test was used to quantify
the antibody responses of six healthy pregnant
women in Nepal who had serum collected while
healthy ( preinfection), when they became ill
with hepatitis E (with jaundice, elevated alanine
transaminase [ALT] levels in serum, and detection of HEV RNA by reverse transcription PCR
[RT-PCR] in stool or serum specimens), and
during late convalescence. Antibody levels
were expressed in Walter Reed (WR) U/mL;
however, these units could be converted to
WHO U/mL by multiplying by 0.125. Among
these six women, the geometric mean antibody
level pre-illness was 0.9 WHO U/mL, rose to
240 U/mL on the day of illness evaluation, and
declined slightly to 90 WHO U/mL, a median of
140 days later (range, 38–275 days). The kinetics

of anti-HEV Ig in serum as determined by the
same immunoassay were further characterized
in a cohort of 62 adults from Nepal with acute
hepatitis E (Myint et al. 2006); the median acute
Ig level was 788 WHO U/mL, which declined
rapidly over 3 months and then at a slower
rate. Late convalescent samples from ∼400
days later in 16 patients ranged from 4 to 125
WHO U/mL (median value ∼31 WHO U/mL).
An ELISA to quantitate IgM to HEV using
the same 56 kDa capsid protein as the immunoassay antigen was also validated in anticipation
of its use to support diagnosis of acute hepatitis
E in clinical trials of the vaccine (Seriwatana
et al. 2002). Among 36 patients hospitalized
with acute hepatitis E, the geometric mean level
of anti-HEV IgM was 3000 WR U/mL a median
of 8 days after symptom onset, declining to 100
WR U/mL, a median of 190 days after symptom
onset. Anti-HEV IgM >100 WR U/mL was detected in serum from >95% of 197 patients with
acute hepatitis E diagnosed by detection of HEV
RNA in serum by RT-PCR. In this series of 197
cases, 189 were considered primary infections
based on the ratio of IgM to total Ig. On the
other hand, among the eight cases with low
IgM-to-Ig ratios, the levels of IgM were low
and the levels of total Ig were extremely high.
These findings extended the results of Bryan
et al. (1994) and strengthened the observation
that typical hepatitis E occurs following a primary HEV infection, although a small fraction
of disease may occur following reinfection characterized by an anamnestic antibody response
having a low level of IgM and a very high level
of IgG.
CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE 56 kDa
VACCINE CANDIDATE
The U.S. Department of Defense has considered
hepatitis E to be a potential medical threat to
military and peacekeeping operations in Asia
and Africa since the 1980s, when it noted
that military personnel of the Soviet Union sustained high rates of hepatitis during operations
in Afghanistan. Accordingly, the U.S. Army
Medical Research and Materiel Command
(USAMRMC) sponsored research directed at
developing a hepatitis E vaccine as early as
1985. The initial aim was to develop diagnostic
methods for enterically transmitted non-A,
non-B hepatitis, as hepatitis E was first designated, and to describe its epidemiology. Staff from
the Uniformed Services University of the Health
Sciences, the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), and the Army Medical College, Rawalpindi established the Pakistan-U.S.
Laboratory for Sero-Epidemiology, which conducted important field studies describing outbreaks of hepatitis E among military personnel
(Iqbal et al. 1989; Ticehurst et al. 1992; Bryan
et al. 1994, 2002). Biological specimens from
this group’s outbreak investigations resulted in
recovery and sequence analysis of the SAR-55
strain of HEV, development of a sensitive ELISA
for serology, and ultimately creation of the
NIH’s hepatitis E vaccine candidate.
At the same time, the WRAIR was supporting field studies of non-A, non-B hepatitis in
Kathmandu, Nepal, prompted by an outbreak
investigation of widespread epidemic hepatitis
in 1981–1982, conducted by the CDC and the
Ministry of Health, Nepal (Kane et al. 1984). A
notable feature of that epidemic was the description of a 21% case fatality ratio in affected pregnant women. Subsequent work with staff from
the Teku Infectious Diseases Hospital (Kathmandu) of the Ministry of Health and the Nepalese Army Medical Department documented
the importance of hepatitis E as a common
cause of serious disease among civilian and military personnel (Clayson et al. 1995, 1997, 1998).
Sequence analysis of six stool specimens collected from patients hospitalized with hepatitis E in
Kathmandu between 1987 and 1995 showed
that all were closely related to contemporary
isolates of HEV from Burma and India, that is,
gt1 (Gouvea et al. 1997).
When the possibility of vaccinating humans
against hepatitis E was suggested by nonhuman
primate studies conducted by the NIH, the
USAMRMC and WRAIR entered into a collaboration with the NIH and GlaxoSmithKline
(GSK) to evaluate the feasibility of developing
a vaccine against hepatitis E. This collaboration
built on the relationships among these same
partners, which resulted in GSK developing

the first vaccine to be licensed for prevention of
hepatitis A (Hoke et al. 1992).
The hepatitis E vaccine candidate developed
by the NIH that was evaluated by the
USAMRMC was the same purified 56 kDa
product, expressed by a recombinant baculovirus in Sf9 cells and adsorbed to 0.5 mg of aluminum as AlOH per 0.5 mL dose, which Purcell
and colleagues used for preclinical tests of safety
and efficacy. Investigators at the WRAIR conducted a phase I randomized, open-label escalating dose trial in 88 healthy HEV-seronegative
U.S. adults 18–50 years of age to evaluate the
safety and immunogenicity of a range of vaccine
doses (1, 5, 20, or 40 µg of capsid protein) administered three times on a 0-, 1-, and 6-month
schedule. All dose levels had an acceptable safety
profile; the three highest dose levels elicited an
anti-HEV Ig response 1 month after dose 3 to at
least 5 WHO U/mL in ≥88.9% of subjects with
GMCs of 24, 38, and 31 WHO U/mL, respectively (Safary 2001). Investigators at the Walter
Reed-Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences Research Unit Nepal then conducted a phase II dose confirmation trial of the vaccine candidate in healthy adults in Kathmandu.
Forty-four seronegative subjects were randomly
allocated (1:1) to dose levels of 5 and 20 µg administered on the same three-dose schedule.
One-month post–dose 3, the anti-HEV Ig seropositivity (i.e., ≥2.5 WHO U/mL) rates and
GMCs were 94% and 17 WHO U/mL (5 µg
group) versus 100% and 47 WHO U/mL (20
µg group) (BL Innis, pers. comm.). The safety
profile in both groups was acceptable. Based on
these two studies, the 20-µg dose was selected for
a phase II proof-of-concept study to assess the
vaccine’s protective efficacy.
As the proof-of-concept trial was designed
to provide a preliminary assessment of safety
and efficacy with a limited sample size, the investigators elected to screen volunteers for antibody to HEV by ELISA so that only susceptible
individuals would be randomized to vaccine or
placebo (Shrestha et al. 2007). Plans to conduct
the trial in the city of Lalitpur, adjacent to Kathmandu, were set aside when local government
officials objected (Stevenson 2000). As the burden of hepatitis E among military personnel was
similar to that among civilians, the Nepalese
Army, with the concurrence of the Ministry of
Health, agreed to host the study among soldiers
based in the Kathmandu Valley, a decision that
generated some controversy in retrospect despite ethical review of the proposed study in
both the United States and Nepal (Bhattarai
2007). Nevertheless, the double-blind trial was
initiated in 2001, with more than 40,000 soldiers
being informed about the study, 5323 consenting to screening, 3323 (62%) being considered
seronegative, and 2000 soldiers (mean age 25
years, range 18–62 years, 99.6% male) consenting to be randomized 1:1 to receive three doses
of vaccine or placebo.
Surveillance for acute hepatitis was conducted among 1566 subjects who were followed for a
median of 804 days. The Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) reviewed 111 episodes of
acute hepatitis and certified 87 as definite hepatitis E before unblinding the trial. These cases
were confirmed by biochemical markers of liver
disease (ALT >2.5 times upper limit of normal
and/or total serum bilirubin >2.0 mg/dL), detection of HEV RNA in serum or stool, and
anti-HEV IgM or total Ig in serum. The median
duration of illness was 29 days; the median maximum serum alanine aminotransferase was
1248 U/L; the median maximum serum total
bilirubin was 9.0 mg/dL.
The trial’s primary objective was to evaluate
the efficacy of a three-dose vaccination course.
From 14 days after the third vaccine dose until
study end, 69 subjects developed hepatitis E—
three in the vaccine group (0.3%) and 66 in the
placebo group (7.4%)—for a vaccine efficacy of
95.5% (95% CI, 85.6–98.6). A secondary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of a two-dose
vaccination course. From 14 days after the second vaccine dose until the administration of
the third dose (∼5 months later), eight subjects
developed hepatitis E—one in the vaccine
group (0.1%) and seven in the placebo group
(0.7%)—for a vaccine efficacy of 85.7% (95%
CI, −16.0–98.2).

cally notable differences between the vaccine
and control groups with respect to spontaneously reported adverse events or serious adverse
events (SAEs). Although there were six deaths
in the vaccine group and only one in the placebo
group, none of the deaths were considered to be
related to vaccination. Given the modest size of
the trial, however, the accumulated safety experience was insufficient to assess the risk of rare
vaccine-related adverse events.
The vaccine was immunogenic. Among subjects in the immunogenicity subgroup who received vaccine, 81.3% had a level of anti-HEV Ig
of at least 2.5 WHO U/mL 1 month after the
second vaccine dose, and 100% had this level 1
month after the third vaccine dose. By study end,
the proportion had declined to 56.3%. Despite
the declining proportion of seropositive vaccine
recipients, there was no apparent diminution of
protection, consistent with the establishment of
immunologic memory, recallable in time to limit infection and prevent disease during the average 5- to 6-week incubation period of hepatitis E.
The results of the proof-of-concept trial
strongly supported the feasibility of preventing
hepatitis E by vaccination and clearly showed
the important contribution of hepatitis E to
overall morbidity among the subjects in the
study, as hepatitis E was the most common medically significant illness resulting in hospitalization and disability in the placebo group. The
investigators concluded that vaccination against
hepatitis E had high potential to improve wellbeing among adults with similar disease exposures.
At the conclusion of the trial, GSK sought
public-sector partners who were willing to invest
in further development of the 56 kDa vaccine
candidate for use where hepatitis E is endemic.
None were forthcoming. Moreover, public
health systems in countries where hepatitis E
remains endemic have made introduction of
life-saving rotavirus and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines for infants a higher priority. Given
these obstacles, and the emergence of a competing hepatitis E vaccine manufactured using a less
costly bacterial expression system (HEV 239,
described below), GSK halted development of
the 56 kDa vaccine.
DISCOVERY AND PRECLINICAL
DEVELOPMENT OF THE HEV 239 VACCINE
CANDIDATE IN CHINA
Hepatitis E is endemic in China. In an epidemiological review from 1991, Zhuang and colleagues (Zhuang et al. 1991) reported the occurrence of nine putative hepatitis E outbreaks
since 1982, the largest of which caused more
than 120,000 cases between September 1986
and April 1988 in Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous
Region in China’s northwest. In this outbreak,
there were 707 deaths with 414 occurring in
pregnant women. Analysis of stool specimens
from patients in this and other outbreaks confirmed the etiology as HEV belonging to gt1
(Aye et al. 1992; Yin et al. 1993). In response
to the growing recognition of the hepatitis E
burden in China, a research program at Xiamen
University was established in 1998 to develop a
diagnostic kit to facilitate diagnosis and, in parallel, a hepatitis E vaccine to prevent disease
(Wu et al. 2012a).
The hepatitis E vaccine development program aimed to express a polypeptide from the
HEV capsid protein in E. coli that contained
neutralizing epitopes presented in particulate
form. The full-length capsid protein can be divided into the S domain (amino acids 118–313),
the P1 domain (amino acids 314–453), and the
P2 domain (amino acids 456–606). The P2 domain containing 153 amino acids is the outermost moiety of the viral capsid. Termed the protrusion domain, it is essential for viral–host
interaction, and contains the known neutralizing epitopes (Li et al. 2009).
To achieve their aim, the developers generated varying lengths of the capsid gene from a
human isolate of a gt1 virus first isolated from
the fecal extract of a patient in the Xinjiang
Uighur Autonomous Region in 1988 (DNA
Data Bank of Japan [DDBJ] accession no.
D11092) (Aye et al. 1992). These were cloned
into the pT0-T7 expression plasmid to generate
recombinant proteins of different length using
an expression system. These various proteins
were evaluated for structure and immunoreactivity with acute patient serum. The HEV E2
capsid polypeptide, consisting of amino acids

394–607, was an early candidate vaccine antigen
as it self-assembled into dimers. This was desirable because Zhang and others, using murine
monoclonal antibodies to the HEV capsid protein, showed that its major neutralizing epitopes
are formed by discontinuous amino acids between positions 470 and 606, and are associated
with a dimeric rather than a monomeric conformation (Zhang et al. 2005). The E2 polypeptide
elicited neutralizing antibodies and protected
against viral challenge when administered to
macaques with Freunds adjuvant. However, E2
without Freunds adjuvant was poorly immunogenic in mice and monkeys (Li et al. 2005b).
Consequently, the developers systematically
evaluated the role of the amino acids between
the amino terminus and carboxyl terminus in
dimer and particle formation. Although the
minimal dimerization domain was located at
amino acids 459–601, further extension of the
amino terminus to amino acid 368 was necessary for particle formation (Li et al. 2005a; Wei
et al. 2014). Thus, a second candidate antigen,
HEV 239 (amino acids 368–606) that had an
amino-terminal extension relative to E2, was
evaluated and found to form dimers that selfassemble into VLPs. Biophysical analysis of the
HEV 239 VLPs by high-performance size-exclusion chromatography, analytical centrifugation, and electron microscopy clearly showed
particles with diameters of 20–30 nm (Li et al.
2005b). HEV 239 was selected as the vaccine
antigen because it showed 200-fold enhancement in immunogenicity in mouse and primate
experiments compared with E2 (Li et al. 2005b;
Wu et al. 2007). HEV 239 VLPs present neutralizing epitopes as confirmed by binding studies
using well-characterized neutralizing murine
monoclonal antibodies 8C11 (specific for gt1
and gt2) and 8G12 (cross-genotype reactive)
(Wei et al. 2014; Zhao et al. 2015). HEV 239
VLPs adsorbed to AlOH were administered as
two doses 4 weeks apart at either 5, 10, or 20 µg
per dose and completely protected rhesus macaques from hepatitis and infection when challenged at week 7 with 104 genome copies (100
infective doses) of homologous gt1 or heterologous gt4 HEV. At a higher challenge dose of 105
infective doses, all dosing regimens completely
protected against hepatitis and partially protected against infection (Li et al. 2005b).
CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE HEV 239
VACCINE CANDIDATE PRELICENSURE
The HEV 239 vaccine candidate evaluated in a
phase I study in 44 healthy HEV seronegative
adults contained 20 µg HEV 239 adsorbed to
AlOH. When administered twice by the intramuscular route at a 1-month interval, it had an
acceptable reactogenicity and safety profile. Subsequently, a phase II clinical trial was conducted
in two parts to assess schedule and dose escalation. Part A enrolled 457 adults, all seronegative
for HEV, who received 20 µg of HEV 239 twice
(months 0 and 6) or thrice (months 0, 1, and 6).
Subjects in the three-dose group had similar seroconversion rates to those in the two-dose
group (100% vs. 98%), but a higher GMC of
anti-HEV IgG (15.9 vs. 8.6 WHO U/mL (Zhang
et al. 2009). Part B was a dose-finding study in
155 high school students at least 16 years of age,
each of whom received three doses of HEV 239
(0-1-6) at one of four different dose levels (10,
20, 30, or 40 µg). All four groups had 100% seroconversion with the three higher dose groups
having better anti-HEV GMCs than the 10-µg
dose group. Adverse event profiles were similar
across all groups (Zhang et al. 2009). Based on
these results, a three-dose regimen of 30 µg of
HEV 239 adsorbed to 0.8 mg AlOH and suspended in 0.5 mL of buffered saline administered intramuscularly at months 0, 1, and 6
was advanced to phase III.
The safety and efficacy of HEV 239 vaccine
was evaluated in a randomized, double blind,
placebo-controlled, single-center phase III clinical trial conducted in a known endemic location, Dongtai, Jiangsu Province, China from August 2007 to May 2009 (Zhu et al. 2010). A total
of 112,604 subjects 16–65 years of age were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive HEV 239 or a
licensed hepatitis B control vaccine intramuscularly at 0, 1, and 6 months. Hepatitis E cases were
identified by active surveillance performed at
205 sentinel sites. The hepatitis E case definition
included (1) clinical symptoms of acute hepatitis
illness lasting for at least 3 days, (2) diagnosis of

acute hepatitis by ALT ≥2.5 times the upper
limit of normal, and (3) at least two of three
positive HEV markers (anti-HEV IgM, HEV
RNA, or a fourfold or greater increase in antiHEV IgG). Safety and efficacy were first assessed
and reported at 1 year (beginning 30 days after
the final dose), and again after an extended follow-up analysis at 55 months.
The trial’s primary objective was to evaluate
prevention of hepatitis E during the first year of
follow-up beginning 30 days after the last dose
(Table 1). The DSMB certified 23 cases of hepatitis E before unblindingfor the primary analysis.
Among cases, the mean maximum serum ALT
was 30.8 times upper limit of normal and the
mean duration of illness was 57.1 days with 15
patients admitted to a hospital. Per-protocol vaccine efficacy was 100% (95% CI, 72.1–100) with
no cases of hepatitis E among vaccine recipients
and 15 cases among placebo recipients. In an
intention-to-treat analysis considering all who
received at least one dose, there was one case of
hepatitis E among vaccine recipients (this participant had received only one dose). All remaining 22 cases were in the placebo group, resulting
in a vaccine efficacy of 95.5% (95% CI, 66.3–99.4)
(Zhu et al. 2010). The efficacy after administration of two doses measured during the 5-month
interval between dose 2 and 3 was also 100%
(95% CI, 9.1–100), which suggests that two doses
administered 1 month apart in an emergency or
outbreak setting might offer protection for at
least 5 months. Of note, the Chinese State Food
and DrugAdministration (SFDA) in their review
of the HEV 239 vaccine’s license application applied a less stringent criterion for biochemical
evidence of liver injury to redefine cases of hepatitis E, that is, ALT greater than the upper limit
of normal. Whereas this cutoff is more sensitive
for detecting mild cases of illness associated with
HEV infection, it likely misclassified mild illness
in both groups as medically important hepatitis
E and biased the efficacy estimate downward.
With the less stringent case definition, the analysis identified nine cases of hepatitis E in the
vaccine group and 26 in the control (as compared with 0 and 15 cases in the per-protocol
analysis) with 48,500 person-years observed in
each group. The resulting vaccine efficacy estimates reported in the approved product insert
are 65% (95% CI, 26–84) for the per-protocol
analysis and 67% (95% CI, 38–82) for an intention-to-treat analysis. They should be viewed as
conservative estimates of vaccine benefit.
In the extension of the phase III clinical trial,
the blind was maintained and all subjects were
followed out for 4.5 years (55 months) using the
same surveillance system. The efficacy of HEV
239 vaccine against clinically apparent hepatitis
E disease according to the protocol case definition (ALT >2.5 times upper limit of normal) was
93.3% (95% CI, 78.6–97.9) in a per-protocol
analysis and 85.1% (95% CI, 67.1–93.3) in an
intention-to-treat analysis (Zhang et al. 2015).
An analysis of follow-up at 7 years postvaccination is ongoing (W Huang, pers. comm.).
As was expected in the geographic area of
the clinical trial, 26 of 29 HEV isolates obtained
from subjects were gt4; the others were gt1. The
high efficacy afforded by the gt1 HEV 239 vaccine against disease caused by gt4 HEV supports
the concept that the diverse HEV genotypes
form a single serotype and HEV 239 vaccine
can protect against all genotypes. Further supporting this concept are immunogenicity data
generated with a monoclonal antibody competition assay using the broadly cross-neutralizing
murine monoclonal 8G12, which detected
broadly cross-neutralizing antibody in serum
specimens from HEV 239 vaccine recipients
(Wu et al. 2017).
Prevention of subclinical infection by administration of HEV 239 vaccine was first shown
in the phase II study and confirmed in the phase
III immunogenicity cohort (Zhang et al. 2009,
2014). In both studies, subclinical infections
were identified by comparing paired serum
samples collected at intervals starting 30 days
after the last dose. A subclinical infection was
defined by seroconversion (from negative to
0.154 WHO U/mL twice the test cutoff level),
or a fourfold or greater increase in titer. In the
phase II study, two doses of 20 µg HEV 239
administered 1 month apart afforded efficacy
against subclinical infection of 86% (95% CI,
18–99) over a 4-month period (Zhang et al.
2009). In the phase III trial, the efficacy against
subclinical infection over a 24-month period

postvaccination was 78% (95% CI, 65–86) in a
per-protocol analysis and 77% (95% CI, 65–85)
in an intention-to-treat analysis.
Reactogenicity data in the phase III trial was
solicited from a subset of participants (∼2600)
from one township; these subjects were intensively followed for solicited and spontaneously
reported adverse events (Table 2). Most adverse
events were mild. Although the frequency of
solicited injection site adverse events was higher
in the vaccine group than the hepatitis B vaccine
control group (2.8% vs. 1.9%, perhaps because of
the 30 µg versus 5 µg disparity in antigen content), the frequency of solicited systemic adverse
events was similar between the two groups. Additionally, adverse events in the phase III trial were
collected from the total vaccinated cohort (Table
2). No safety signal was detected during the first
19 months of the trial. Over the extended 4.5-year
follow-up period, a similar number of participants reported SAEs in the vaccine and placebo
groups. None of the SAEs were attributed to the
investigational vaccine. Overall, HEV 239 was
considered to have an acceptable safety profile.
Although pregnancy was an exclusion criterion for enrollment, there were 37 women in the
vaccine group and 31 in the control group who
were inadvertently administered vaccine during
pregnancy (Wu et al. 2012b). The rates of adverse events were similar between the women in
the HEV 239 group and the control vaccine recipients, as were the anthropometrics and gestational ages of the infants.
More than 11,000 vaccine and control recipients were included in an immunogenicity subset and had serum samples taken before vaccination and 1 month following the third dose. A
complete three-dose course of HEV 239 elicited
antibody responses in 99.9% of those seronegative at baseline with peak GMC of antibody of
15 WHO U/mL 1 month after the last vaccination. This titer is considerably higher than found
in persons after they recover from natural infection (0.6 WHO U/mL) but is lower than that
elicited by acute hepatitis E (80.9 WHO U/
mL) (Zhang et al. 2014).
At 55 months after first vaccination, 87%
percent of these subjects remained seropositive;
however, the GMC had declined to 0.27 WHO
U/mL. Despite this antibody decline, vaccine
efficacy remained high at 93% (95% CI, 79–
98). The antibody levels of subjects seronegative
at baseline who received only two doses of HEV
239 were only slightly lower than the levels induced by three doses at 55 months, suggesting
that a two-dose regimen might be a feasible future vaccination strategy. A modeling analysis to
estimate the long-term persistence of antibody
was conducted using a subpopulation from the
per-protocol immunogenicity cohort that had
serum samples collected at multiple time points
out to 5 years from one township, followed by a
similar validation subpopulation from a second
township to assess the robustness of the model.
A well-fitted modified power-law model, which
accounts for both activated and memory B-cell
decay, predicted that half of the baseline seronegative subjects would have detectable antibody titers for more than 30 years (Andraud
et al. 2012; Chen et al. 2015). Among those seropositive at baseline, antibody levels were indistinguishable at 55 months regardless of whether
the subject received one, two, or three doses of
HEV 239.
Although there were seven breakthrough
cases of hepatitis among vaccine recipients
over the course of the 55-month follow-up,
none of them occurred in the immunogenicity
cohort; therefore, a protective antibody level
could not be estimated within this trial (Zhang
et al. 2015). Using the immunogenicity cohort of
the phase III trial, Zhang and colleagues looked
at the relative risk of 2-year cumulative infection
rates among subjects, irrespective of whether
they had vaccine or naturally induced antibody,
against different HEV antibody levels at 1-
month post–last dose. They found that those
with an anti-HEV IgG level >1.0 WHO U/mL
were significantly more protected against infection (Zhang et al. 2014).

HEV 239 vaccine, named Hecolin (Hepatitis E
vaccine, E. coli), was approved for use in persons
16 years of age and older in December 2011.
From isolation of the parent gt1 virus from a
patient to registration of the recombinant vaccine, the development of Hecolin took 14 years
(Wu et al. 2012a). Following the product launch
in 2012, the vaccine is available in the private
market in China, but Innovax is seeking approval of the HEV 239 in Pakistan, Nepal, India, and
Thailand (W Huang, pers. comm.).
Further studies of the vaccine are in progress. The safety and immunogenicity of HEV
239 vaccine in healthy individuals infected at
baseline with hepatitis B virus (HBsAg-positive)
has been assessed in an exploratory subanalysis
in the phase III trial, and found to be similar to
that of the general trial population (Wu et al.
2013). It is known that individuals with chronic
liver disease (CLD) have a higher risk of severe
hepatitis E if infected, similar to the effect of
acute hepatitis A or B on patients with CLD,
and would therefore be an important target population for this vaccine (Wang et al. 1986; Dalton et al. 2007). Hepatitis A and B vaccines have
been found to be safe and immunogenic in individuals with CLD, and are recommended for
use in patients without the corresponding infection. A post-licensure study to assess the safety
and immunogenicity of HEV 239 in subjects

Grade 3 pain, headache, and fatigue were defined as prevention of normal activities; grade 3 swelling was defined as a
diameter of more than 30 mm; grade 3 itch was defined as body itch; and grade 3 fever was defined as temperature greater than
39.0°C. Symptoms with frequency more than 1% in any group are listed. a
p Values are two-sided and were calculated by Fisher’s exact test. b
Unsolicited adverse events included any adverse events that happened from day 4 to day 30 after each dose and any adverse
events within 3 days after each dose, but had not been listed in the diary card for registering solicited adverse events. Most often,
unsolicited adverse events in the study included upper respiratory tract infection, headache, fever, and gastritis. c
The Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) did not deem any of the serious adverse events to be related to vaccination.

Twenty-two participants died within 30 days after each vaccination. Of the 10 participants in the vaccine group that died,
eight died as the result of an accident, one died of a cerebral hemorrhage, and one died of liver cancer after 10 years with chronic
hepatitis B. Of 12 participants in the placebo group that died, six died as the result of an accident, three died of myocardial
infarction, two died of cerebral hemorrhage, and one died of stomach cancer. (From Zhu et al. 2010; reprinted, with permission,

with CLD is currently underway in Shandong
Province, China with results expected in 2018
(NCT02964910; W Huang, pers. comm.).
In another post-licensure study conducted
in China, the safety and immunogenicity of
HEV 239 vaccine is being evaluated in healthy
individuals over 65 years of age, with results
expected in 2018 (NCT02189603; W Huang,
pers. comm.). Moreover, a study to evaluate
the immunogenicity of an accelerated dosing
regimen of the HEV 239 vaccine that might be
better suited for outbreak settings was initiated
in Zhejiang Province, China. The study will
compare the approved vaccination schedule (0,
1, 6 months) with dosing at 0, 7, and 21 days,
with results expected in 2019 (NCT03168412;
W Huang, pers. comm.). Finally, a study to determine the effectiveness of HEV 239 vaccine in
preventing hepatitis E disease among women
of childbearing age is ongoing in Bangladesh
(NCT02759991). As gt1 HEV is predominant
in Bangladesh, this study may provide empiric
confirmation that HEV 239 protects an important risk group against disease caused by this
vaccine-homologous genotype that is thought
to be more pathogenic for humans than gt4.
No studies of HEV 239 vaccine have been
conducted in immunosuppressed or immunocompromised patients such as solid organ transplant recipients, HIV-positive subjects, or those
receiving chemotherapy.
RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE WHO
In May 2015, the WHO published a hepatitis E
vaccine position paper (World Health Organization 2015). In that paper, the WHO Scientific
Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) acknowledged the significant public health problem
posed by hepatitis E, particularly among special
populations such as pregnant women and individuals living in displaced persons camps,
yet also noted that there are significant data
gaps concerning the incidence of HEV infection
and disease worldwide. Although Hecolin was
considered to be a promising vaccine, the WHO
SAGE concluded that there were insufficient
data to justify a recommendation for routine
use. It was acknowledged that national authorities may decide to use the vaccine based on their
local epidemiology, and certain high-risk situations, such as outbreaks, warranted consideration for vaccine use. The WHO SAGE suggested specific areas of additional study for Hecolin,
which included immunization of individuals
under 16 years of age, the elderly, and highrisk groups such as pregnant women, immunocompromised persons, and those with CLD. In
addition, the WHO SAGE suggested that evaluation of vaccine impact in outbreak situations
would be valuable, as would exploration of
alternative and abbreviated dosing schedules
more suitable for outbreaks. Finally, the WHO
SAGE noted that vaccine efficacy had only been
shown against disease caused by gt4 (World
Health Organization 2015).
Since vaccine registration in China in 2011,
there has been no use of Hecolin outside of China other than the ongoing effectiveness study in
Bangladesh. Although there is great interest
among humanitarian aid agencies to deploy
this vaccine preemptively in high-risk displaced
population camps and hepatitis E outbreaks,
several barriers remain. The vaccine has not
yet been prequalified by the WHO, a necessary
product endorsement that would allow United
Nations (UN) procurement agencies to purchase the vaccine for use in health emergency
settings. For the WHO to consider a vaccine for
prequalification, there must be a set of written
standards (Technical Report Series) that detail
the required specifications for a product. To
date, no such technical documents have been
developed for hepatitis E vaccine. Recently, the
WHO convened its first meeting to develop
these technical documents. Once these technical
documents are approved (expected in 2018), a
hepatitis E vaccine manufacturer can submit a
dossier requesting prequalification. It remains to
be seen whether the WHO will prequalify Hecolin for general use or in an emergency setting,
in spite of the absence of clinical data concerning protection against hepatitis E caused by gt1–
gt3, administration of the vaccine to children
less than 16 years of age, or to persons who are
immunocompromised, and the sparse data concerning vaccine use in women who are pregnant
or breastfeeding. In addition, the current preB.L. Innis and J.A. Lynch

sentation (bulky single-dose packaging without
auto-disable syringes) and the three-dose schedule increase the challenges to widespread use of
the vaccine in the most needed settings.
CONCLUDING REMARKS
Here, we have summarized the abundant evidence that hepatitis E vaccine is acceptably safe
and effective for prevention of disease caused by
HEV, regardless of genotype, in persons 16 years
of age and older. We have also discussed the
information gaps that exist and steps that might
be taken to make vaccination against hepatitis E
widely available. Hepatitis E vaccine is approved
in China, but there is no recommendation for its
use in China’s national immunization program
as a result of the low incidence of hepatitis E (2.1
cases per 10,000 person-years in the phase III
control group [Zhang et al. 2015]) and the complexity of delivering vaccination to persons at
increased risk. On the other hand, there are
adult populations in low- and middle-income
countries in Asia and Africa where the risk of
hepatitis E is 100-fold greater, making targeted
vaccination programs more cost-effective if the
product were available in those countries. Regrettably, the value of hepatitis E vaccination
in these populations is not reliably documented.
These deficiencies have prevented funding agencies from prioritizing hepatitis E disease and
committing the financial support needed to enable greater access to vaccine.
We assert that hepatitis E vaccine can save
lives, particularly among women of reproductive age living where hepatitis E is endemic. A
value proposition for its use in high-burden settings and a demand forecast must be generated
by the international health community while the
manufacturer pursues WHO prequalification.
We look forward to a future when control of
hepatitis E by vaccination is a possibility for
those who need it.
