Busulphan (Bu) is a myeloablative drug used for conditioning prior to hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation. Bu is predominantly metabolized through glutathione conjugation, a reaction that 
consumes the hepatic glutathione. N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) is a glutathione precursor used in the 
treatment of acetaminophen hepatotoxicity. NAC does not interfere with the busulphan myeloablative 
efect. We investigated the efect of NAC concomitant treatment during busulphan conditioning on 
the liver enzymes as well as the clinical outcome. Prophylactic NAC treatment was given to 54 patients 
upon the start of busulphan conditioning. These patients were compared with 54 historical matched 
controls who did not receive NAC treatment. In patients treated with NAC, aspartate transaminase 
(AST), alanine transaminase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were signifcantly (P<0.05) 
decreased after conditioning compared to their start values. Within the NAC-group, liver enzymes were 
normalized in those patients (30%) who had signifcantly high start values. No signifcant decrease in 
enzyme levels was observed in the control group. Furthermore, NAC afected neither Bu kinetics nor 
clinical outcome (sinusoidal obstruction syndrome incidence, graft-versus-host disease and/or graft 
failure). In conclusion: NAC is a potential prophylactic treatment for hepatotoxicity during busulphan 
conditioning. NAC therapy did not alter busulphan kinetics or afect clinical outcome.
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a curative treatment for malignancies such as leukemia, 
lymphomas and some solid tumors, as well as non-malignant diseases such as metabolic disorders and aplastic anemia1
. Several acute and chronic complications may occur and hamper treatment success, including 
graf-versus-host disease (GVHD), infections and sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS, previously called 
venoocclusive disease, VOD).
Te conditioning regimen is an important step during HSCT. Conditioning regimens contains either total 
body irradiation (TBI)-based (TBI and cytostatics) or chemotherapy-based (combinations of cytostatics without 
TBI). According to the administered doses (intensity), conditioning regimens can also be divided into myeloablative and non-myeloablative regimen2
.
Busulphan (Bu) is chemotherapeutic agent that has been in clinical use since 19523
. Busulphan is predominantly metabolized in the liver by conjugation with glutathione (GSH)4–7
. Cytosolic glutathione S-transferases 
(GSTs) have been identifed as the enzymes catalyzing this conjugation. GSTA1 is the most active glutathione 
transferase in catalyzing Bu-GSH conjugation, while GSTM1 and GSTP1 are less active8,9
. Tis conjugation 
results in the formation of sulfonium ion that is an unstable intermediate and is degraded to tetrahydrothiophene 
(THT). Oxidation products of THT, such as THT 1-oxide, sulfolane and 3-hydroxy sulfolane represent the majority of identifed Bu metabolites4–7

Busulphan was previously reported to cause liver toxicity such as SOS in patients undergoing HSCT10–13. 
SOS is an early complication and the most common causes of death in these patients10,11. SOS was defned by 
McDonlad et al. as the onset of two of the following occurring before day 30 post-HSCT: (1) jaundice (bilirubin>27µmol/L), (2) tender hepatomegaly and (3) ascites or weight gain. While Jones et al. narrowed the defnition to the following: onset before day 21 post-HSCT of hyperbilirubinemia (bilirubin>34µmol/L) as well as two 
of the following: (1) hepatomegaly, (2) ascites and (3) weight gain14,15.
Busulphan was reported to consume up to 60% of the hepatic GSH in vivo and 50% in vitro, thus; cells lacking 
GSH are more sensitive to Bu toxicity16. GSH is an important intracellular antioxidant and its exhaustion by cytotoxic drugs and/or radiation may contribute to the development of SOS. Moreover, endothelial cell damage due 
to the toxicity of conditioning regimen may lead to activation of several clotting factors13,17.
N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) is a GSH precursor that increases the cellular content of GSH18. NAC is used in the 
treatment of hepatotoxicity caused by acetaminophen as well as for the treatment of SOS19,20. We have reported 
the use of NAC in the treatment of three patients who developed SOS afer HSCT. Later, the liver enzymes of these 
patients decreased and all three patients achieved normal bilirubin levels and prothrombin times20. We have also 
reported that NAC does not interfere with the myeloablative efect of Bu in vitro or in animal models, and that 
it can be considered for SOS prophylaxis during Bu conditioning21. Later, these fndings have been confrmed 
in ten patients at high risk for SOS due to pre-transplant liver disorders or elevated liver enzymes. NAC did not 
afect Bu kinetics or its myeloablative efect. Moreover, liver enzymes were normalized in all patients and none of 
them developed SOS22. Currently, all patients treated with Bu are receiving prophylactic NAC upon the start of 
Bu conditioning according to the hospital protocol.
In this study, we investigated the efect of prophylactic treatment of NAC during Bu conditioning on the clinical outcome in terms of liver enzymes, relapse, SOS, GVHD and graf rejection.
Results
Liver enzymes. In patients treated with NAC, aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT) 
and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were signifcantly (P<0.0001, P=0.016 and P=0.0002 respectively, t-test) 
decreased afer conditioning compared to their start values before the initiation of conditioning. AST mean 
value was 0.36±0.16 µkat/L afer conditioning compared to 0.66±0.32 µkat/L before the start of conditioning 
(Fig. 1A). ALT mean value was 0.62±0.47 µkat/L afer conditioning compared to 0.91±0.69 µkat/L before the 
beginning of conditioning (Fig. 2A). Finally, ALP mean value was 1.39±0.82µkat/L afer conditioning compared 
to 2.39±1.32µkat/L before the initiation of conditioning (Fig. 3A).
On the other hand, no signifcant decrease of these enzymes levels was observed in the control group (P=0.15, 
P=0.39 and P=0.12, t-test) for AST, ALT and ALP, respectively. Te mean values for AST before and afer conditioning were 0.65±0.43 µkat/L and 0.50±0.61 µkat/L, respectively (Fig. 1A), ALT before and afer conditioning 
were 0.80±0.85µkat/L and 1.04±1.81µkat/L, respectively (Fig. 2A), and ALP before and afer conditioning were 
3.67±4.94µkat/L and 2.50±1.92µkat/L, respectively (Fig. 3A).
Patients treated with NAC were further divided into two subgroups. Te frst subgroup involved patients with 
normal liver status before the start of the conditioning (n=37 patients). Teir mean values were 0.49±0.16µkat/L, 
0.55±0.28µkat/L and 1.21±0.25µkat/L for AST, ALT and ALP respectively. Te second group had high liver values before the start of the conditioning (1.03±0.25µkat/L, 1.87±0.51µkat/L and 3.14±1.16µkat/L for AST, ALT 
and ALP, respectively, n=17 patients).
A significant decrease in the liver values (AST mean = 0.41 ± 0.15 µkat/L, P < 0.0001 (Fig. 1B), ALT 
mean=0.96±0.53 µkat/L, P<0.0001 (Fig. 2B), ALP mean=2.29±0.97 µkat/L, P=0.046, t-test (Fig. 3B)) was 
observed afer conditioning in patients who had high liver enzymes before treatment started. Te mean values for AST, ALT and ALP in patients with normal liver status did not increase but further decreased (AST 
mean = 0.33 ± 0.16 µkat/L, P < 0.0001 (Fig. 1B), ALT mean = 0.53 ± 0.41 µkat/L, P = 0.75 (Fig. 2B), ALP 
mean=1.06±0.24 µkat/L, P=0.19, t-test (Fig. 3B)). Patients in the control group were also divided into two 
subgroups according to their liver status before the start of the conditioning and presented in the Supplementary 
Fig. S1. In addition, the individual values for each patient are presented in the Supplementary Figs S2–S6.
Clinical outcome.
a. No signifcant diference was observed in Bu exposure as expressed as area under the concentration-time 
curve (AUC) in both NAC and control groups. Te mean Bu AUC afer the frst dose was 10588ng.hr/L 
compared to 9324ng.hr/L in the control group. Bu AUCs have been calculated over the 4 days of treatment 
in NAC group. No signifcant diference was observed through the conditioning period. Te mean Bu 
AUCs were 10588, 11008, 11813 and 11000ng.hr/L from day 1 to day 4.
b. No signifcant diference was observed between the two groups in regard to clinical outcome such as SOS, 
acute or chronic GVHD, relapse, graf failure and survival (Figs 4, 5, and 6). Te survival was followed up 
for three years in the control group while in NAC group the follow up time was three years in 50 out of 54 
patients and over 100 days in 4 patients.
Bilirubin values at day +20 were highly elevated in the control group compared to NAC group; in patients 
treated with NAC, the mean value for bilirubin at day +20 was 24.2±36.0µmol/L compared to 7.2±4.9 µmol/L 
before the start of conditioning (P=0.001, t-test). On the other hand, the mean value for bilirubin at day +20 
in the control group was 42.4±85.4 µmol/L compared to 10.4±10.1 µmol/L before the start of conditioning 
(P=0.005, t-test) (Fig. 7A). At day +20, there were only 4 patients with bilirubin>40 µmol/L in NAC group 
compared to 15 patients in the control group (P=0.01).

Patients with bilirubin>40µmol/L (n=19, 4 patients from NAC group and 15 patients from control group) at 
day +20 showed signifcantly lower survival compared to patients with bilirubin≤40µmol/L, P=0.005 (Fig. 7B).
Relapse was relatively higher in the control group (16 patients compared to 13 patients treated with NAC). 
Interestingly, none of the patients treated with NAC developed any molecular relapse compared to 5 patients in 
the control group (Table 1).

Discussion
HSCT is a curative treatment for several malignant and non-malignant diseases. However, the results are far from 
satisfactory due to life threatening toxicities and adverse-efects. Tese toxicities are mostly due to the conditioning regimen used prior to HSCT and several strategies have been introduced to improve the clinical outcome23–31.
Busulphan is mainly used as a myeloablative agent and as an alternative to TBI32. Several serious complications 
such as elevated liver enzymes, SOS, hemorrhagic cystitis, interstitial pneumonia and mucositis have been correlated to high-dose busulphan10–12,15,33. Busulphan is known to have a narrow therapeutic window and its adverse 
efects are delayed34,35.
As mentioned earlier, busulphan is conjugated to GSH via GSTs, mainly GSTA19
. Diferent GSTA1 polymorphisms in addition to the involvement of other isoforms such as GSTP1 and GSTM1 were reported to afect Bu 
kinetics8,9,36. NAC is known to increase the cellular content of GSH18 and it is used in the treatment of SOS and 
hepatotoxicity caused by acetaminophen19,20. Moreover, it was reported that NAC increases liver blood fow and 
improves liver function in septic shock patients37.

(TRM), no signifcant diference was observed between the two groups of patients. Some of the patients treated 
with NAC were transplanted recently, so we were unable to follow their survival for more than one year. 4 
patients are still within the frst year of survival afer transplantation. Solid line=NAC, dashed line=Controls.
Figure 3. Te mean alkaline phosphatase (ALP) values before and afer busulphan conditioning for patients 
treated with N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) versus the control group. In patients treated with NAC (n=54), 
ALP was signifcantly (P=0.0002) decreased afer conditioning compared to the values before the start of 
conditioning. ALP mean value was 1.39±0.82µkat/L afer conditioning compared to 2.39±1.32µkat/L 
before the start of conditioning (A). On the other hand, there was no signifcant decrease for the same 
enzyme in the control group (P=0.12, n=54). Te mean values for ALP before and afer conditioning were 
3.67±4.94µkat/L and 2.50±1.92µkat/L, respectively (A). Patients treated with NAC were further divided 
into two subgroups; the frst subgroup involved patients with normal ALP before the start of conditioning (the 
mean value was 1.21±0.25µkat/L, n=37), while the other group had high ALP before the start of conditioning 
(3.14±1.16 µkat/L, n=17). Afer conditioning, there was a signifcant decrease in ALP for those patients who 
had high levels (mean=2.29±0.97 µkat/L, P=0.046) (B). Te mean values for patients with normal ALP did 
not increase but further decreased (ALP mean=1.06±0.24µkat/L, P=0.19)(B). Symbols present both mean

In our present study, we investigated the role of NAC as prophylactic treatment during Bu therapy in reducing 
liver toxicity if NAC treatment started at the beginning of conditioning, not afer the elevation of liver enzymes. 
Our group has previously reported that NAC does not interfere with the myeloablative efect or kinetics of Bu and 
can be used as SOS prophylactic during Bu treatment21,22.
In patients treated with NAC, AST, ALT and ALP were signifcantly decreased afer conditioning compared to 
their start values. No signifcant decrease in these enzymes was found in the control group (afer Bu treatment). 
However; ALT, which is known to be more specifc for liver injury38 was further elevated by the end of conditioning. Te reduction in the mean values for AST and ALP in the control group can be due to the administration of 
the liver prophylactic drug, ursodeoxycholic acid39,40. Moreover, the standard deviations for all enzymes afer Bu 
treatment were higher in the control group compared to that seen in patients received prophylactic NAC treatment. One possible explanation is that NAC may have an additive efect that signifcantly caused a decrease in the 
liver enzymes and improved its function.
Patients treated with NAC were further divided into two subgroups according to their liver status before Bu 
conditioning. Interestingly, for patients with high liver values AST, ALT and ALP were signifcantly decreased or 
normalized by the end of conditioning. Additionally, the mean values for patients with normal liver status before 
conditioning did not increase, but further decreased.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the frst study containing relatively large number of well-matched group of 
patients to report a signifcant reduction in liver enzymes using NAC as prophylactic treatment during high-dose 
Bu-treatment. Our group has previously reported normalized liver values in ten patients received concomitant 
NAC treatment along with Bu conditioning22.
De Leve et al. showed that treatment with Bu depleted GSH, while increased levels of GSH in hepatocytes is 
protective against Bu toxicity16. GSH is exhausted due to the efect of cytostatics or radiation as reported previously and may contribute to SOS development41. Animals treated with NAC were protected against SOS induced 
by GSH exhaustion by monocrotaline42. On the other hand, depletion of GSH increases the toxicity of alkylating 
agents both in vivo and in vitro43. In the present study, there was no signifcant diference in SOS in both groups

that can be due to Bu dose adjustment; however, liver toxicity, expressed as elevated liver enzymes, was much 
lower in patients treated with NAC.
In a pilot study, NAC showed positive efects on liver status in three patients who developed SOS afer HSCT. 
In all the three patients, liver enzymes decreased and bilirubin levels and prothrombin times were normalized20. 
On the other hand, in a randomized study from our hospital, it has been shown that NAC did not improve liver 
toxicity afer HSCT. Te negative fndings are most probably due to the fact that NAC treatment was started at the 
frst sign of liver toxicity. Unfortunately, neither a group for prophylactic treatment with NAC nor a control group 
was included in the study44. In the present study, we started prophylactic treatment with NAC for all patients upon 
the beginning of conditioning regardless of their liver status. In agreement with the previous study, NAC did not 
afect SOS incidence44.
It has been previously reported that the occurrence of SOS is correlated with an increased bilirubin 
>27 µmol/L before day 3014 or >34 µmol/L at day 2115,45,46. Our investigation showed that only four patients 
with bilirubin>40 µmol/L were observed in NAC group compared to 15 patients found in the control group. 
Te present results confrm that NAC has signifcantly improved the liver functions during high dose busulphan 
treatment compared to the control group and hence NAC treatment may reduce the risk for SOS development. 
Tis hopefully can improve the clinical outcome, however; further long-term follow up studies are urgently warranted to confrm these fndings.
Furthermore, the present results are in agreement with several previous studies showing that patients who had 
bilirubin levels of >40µmol/L at day +20 showed signifcantly lower survival rate compared to these patients who 
had bilirubin<40µmol/L45,47.
Defbrotide is a deoxyribonucleic acid derivative that is used as an anticoagulant for the prophylaxis and 
treatment of SOS and which was approved by the FDA in April 2016 for the treatment of SOS followed HSCT48. 
Several studies have reported the importance of defbrotide as a prophylactic treatment for SOS. However, this 
drug is rather expensive. Veenstra et al., have reported that the budget impact of defbrotide for a transplantation 
center is relatively modest compared to the overall cost of transplantation and that it provided an important 
survival advantage for SOS with multi-organ dysfunction patients, which makes it cost-efective49. On the other 
hand, another study has concluded that prophylactic treatment with defbrotide for children at risk for SOS is 
not cost-efective with respect to transplantation-related mortality and length of hospital stay50. According to 
both McDonalds and Jones criteria, SOS is correlated to signifcant increase in bilirubin. In the present study, we 
have shown that NAC treatment has signifcantly reduced the liver enzymes levels as well as the bilirubin levels at 
day +20, thus we suggest that NAC can be a well-afordable potential prophylaxis of SOS if given concomitantly 
during Bu conditioning before the start of liver toxicity. However; further studies are warranted to confrm these 
fndings.
Moreover, SOS was reported to be afected by Bu dose adjustment and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). 
Te incidence of SOS was decreased from 24.1% to 3.4% in patients when dose individualization was introduced28. Copelan et al., found a signifcant positive correlation between high Bu AUC and SOS and early mortality; however, long-term outcome of the patients was not signifcantly infuenced by Bu levels51. In our study, Bu 
dose adjustment for all patients may explain the low incidence of SOS observed in both groups.

Our present results showed that NAC did not afect Bu-kinetics since there was no signifcant diference in the 
mean AUC of Bu in patients treated with NAC compared to the control group. Furthermore, the Bu mean AUCs 
were almost constant over the 4 days of conditioning. Our current results are in good agreement with the previously 
reported results showing that NAC did not afect the pharmacokinetics or myelosuppressive properties of Bu21,22.
Busulphan administration is known to be followed by several acute and late complications afer HSCT, such 
as GVHD, graf failure and relapse52–55. In our study, some of the patients treated with NAC were transplanted 
recently, so we were unable to follow the long term survival or late complications. However, for the rest of the 
patients, NAC did not afect the clinical outcome and no signifcant diference was observed between the two 
groups. Karlsson et al., have reported that NAC can increase acute GVHD in transplanted patients56. However, 
in their study, NAC was administered for a median of 15 days (up to 89 days in some patients) and started afer 
transplantation, with early liver toxicity. Tere was no patient data, such as age, sex or diagnosis, in their report56.
Busulphan/cyclophosphamide (Cy) is one of the most common conditioning regimens used in the clinical 
setting. Cyclophosphamide is a prodrug that is converted to its active metabolite, 4-hydroxy cyclophosphamide 
(4-OH-Cy), through cytochrome P-450. GSH is an important enzyme for 4-OH-Cy detoxifcation57,58. Possible 
accumulation of the cytotoxic 4-OH-Cy due to GSH consumption by Bu may cause hepatic damage and increase 
the incidence of SOS29. Te time interval between the last Bu dose and the frst Cy-dose is important for the development of SOS. A signifcant lower incidence of SOS was found when time interval was >24hours compared to 
that seen when the interval was 12 hours29. Moreover, alteration of the administration order of Bu-Cy to Cy-Bu 
gives the same engrafment outcome but reduces the toxicity of the conditioning regimen both in patients and 
mice59,60. Additionally, at steady state concentration (Css) of 800–900ng/mL, none of the patients with myelofbrosis experienced SOS when Cy was administered prior to Bu compared to 30% in patients conditioned with Bu 
followed by Cy61.

In conclusion, N-acetylcysteine is a potential prophylactic treatment against the hepatotoxicity during 
busulphan-based conditioning regimens. NAC therapy did not afect the clinical outcome in terms of SOS, 
GVHD, relapse rate, survival rate, etc. NAC therapy is safe and does not alter busulphan pharmacokinetics or 
pharmacodynamics as we reported previously. Te present results can be utilized for personalized medicine 
which in turn may afect treatment related toxicity and hence improve clinical outcome in HSCT patients.
Patients and Methods
One hundred and eight patients were included for this study. All patients were undergoing HSCT at the Center 
for Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation (CAST), Karolinska University Hospital, Huddinge, Sweden. Te study 
was approved by the ethical committee of Karolinska Institutet (616/03) and informed consent was obtained from 
the patients(or their parents). All methods were carried out in accordance with the guidelines and regulations of 
Karolinska University Hospital.
Patients were divided into two groups; each group consisted of 54 patients (32 males and 22 females in each 
group). Te frst group of patients received NAC twice daily at a dose of 100mg/kg upon the start of Bu conditioning during the period of 2011–2016. Te second historical group (control group) did not receive any NAC during 
busulphan conditioning and were being treated between 2000 and 2010 before NAC was introduced as a part of 
the treatment protocol. Te control group was matched for the most important factors, such as sex, age, diagnosis, 
donor, stem cell source and GVHD prophylaxis. All patients received the same supportive care in both groups. 
Furthermore all patients received ursodeoxycholic acid as prophylactic treatment against liver toxicity39,40. SOS 
was diagnosed according to McDonlad criteria14. Patient characteristics and clinical outcome have been collected 
and presented in Table 1.
Busulphan was administered orally at a dose of 2mg/kg B.I.D for 4 consecutive days30. Twenty four hours afer 
the last dose of Bu, Cy was administered as i.v. infusion (60 mg/kg/day) once daily for two days to all patients. 
Blood samples were collected at several time points during Bu conditioning for TDM in order to perform dose 
adjustment. All patients received myeloablative treatment with a target Bu AUC of 9.000–12.000 ng.hr/L per 
dose30. Te level of Bu in plasma was determined using gas chromatography (GC) afer drug extraction, according 
to our previously published protocol30.
Liver enzymes such as AST, ALT and ALP are routinely measured before and afer Bu conditioning. According 
to the hospital protocol, liver enzymes are evaluated in the morning (8 am) one day before the start of Bu 
conditioning and on day 5 morning (8 am, 24 h afer Bu last dose) and the normal liver values are as follows: 
AST<0.76µkat/L, ALT<1.1µkat/L, ALP<1.9µkat/L. Additionally, to confrm the efect of busulphan treatment 
on the liver status, the peak bilirubin at day +20 was measured as an evidence for the clinical outcome45–47.
GVHD prophylaxis consisted mainly of cyclosporine (CsA) in combination with four doses of methotrexate 
(MTX)62. During the frst month, blood CsA levels were maintained at 100ng/mL for patients transplanted from 
sibling donors and at 200–300ng/mL for patients transplanted from matched unrelated donor (MUD). In the 
absence of GVHD, CsA was successively discontinued in patients with sibling donors afer three to four months 
and in patients with MUD afer six months. Patients receiving a cord blood graf received CsA and prednisolone 
(n=6). Five patients were given tacrolimus and sirolimus63.
Most patients received peripheral-blood stem cells (PBSC) (n=71), while 31 received bone marrow and six 
patients received a cord blood graf. Before aphaeresis, all donors of PBSC were treated subcutaneously once a 
day with G-CSF (Rhône-Poulenc Rorer, Lyon, France or Amgen-Roche Inc., Tousand Oaks, CA, USA), 10 μg/
kg/day for 4 to 6 days63.
Acute and chronic GVHD were diagnosed on the basis of clinical symptoms and/or biopsies (skin, liver, 
gastrointestinal tract, or oral mucosa) according to standard criteria64. Te patients were treated for grade I acute 
GVHD with topical steroids, while higher grades of acute GVHD were treated with prednisone, starting at a 
dosage of 2 mg/kg/day, which was successively lowered afer the initial response. Chronic GVHD was initially 
treated with CsA and steroids. In most cases, daily prednisone at 1mg/kg per day and daily CsA at 10mg/kg per 
day were used65.
Data was normally distributed and all statistical analyses and graphs were carried out using GraphPad Prism 
(version 4.0, GraphPad Sofware, Inc.) and SigmaPlot (version 12.5, Systat sofware, Inc.). Busulphan kinetics 
parameters including AUC were calculated using one-compartment open model (WinNonLin, version 2.0). Te 
level of probability (P) for t-test is deemed to constitute the threshold for statistical signifcance when P<0.05.
