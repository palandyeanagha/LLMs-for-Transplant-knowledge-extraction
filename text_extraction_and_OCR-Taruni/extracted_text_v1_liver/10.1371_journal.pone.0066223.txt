Abstract
Objective: To examine the role of antiretroviral drugs (ART), HIV-related and traditional risk factors on the incidence of
chronic kidney disease (CKD) in HIV-infected patients.
Design: Prospective hospital-based cohort of HIV-infected patients from 2004 to 2012.
Methods: CKD was defined using MDRD equation as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 60 ml/mn/
1.73 m2 at 2 consecutive measurements $3 months apart. Poisson regression models were used to study determinants of
CKD either measured at baseline or updated. ART exposure was classified as ever or never. We additionally tested the role of
tenofovir (TDF), whether or not prescribed concomitantly with a Protease Inhibitor (PI), taking into account the cumulative
exposure to the drug.
Results: 4,350 patients (74% men) with baseline eGFR.60 ml/mn/1.73 m2 were followed for a median of 5.8 years. At the
end of follow-up, 96% had received ART, one third of them (35%) jointly received TDF and a PI. Average incidence rate of
CKD was 0.95% person-years of follow-up. Incidence of CKD was higher among women (IRR = 2.2), older patients (.60 y vs
,45 y: IRR = 2.5 and 45–60 y: IRR = 1.7), those with diabetes (IRR = 1.9), high blood pressure (IRR = 1.5), hyperlipidemia
(IRR = 1.5), AIDS stage (IRR = 1.4), low baseline eGFR (IRR = 15.8 for 60,eGFR,70 ml/mn/1.73 m2 vs .90 and IRR = 7.1 for
70,eGFR,80 ml/mn/1.73 m2
), current CD4+,200 cells/mm3 vs .500/mm3 (IRR = 2.5), and exposure to TDF (IRR = 2.0).
Exposure to TDF was even strongly associated with CKD when co-administered with PIs (IRR = 3.1 vs 1.3 when not,
p,0,001). A higher risk of CKD was found when tenofovir exposure was .12 months [IRR = 3.0 with joint PIs vs 1.3 without
(p,0.001)]. A vast majority of those developing CKD (76.6%) had a baseline eGFR between 60 and 80 ml/mn/1.73 m2
.
Conclusion: In patients with eGFR between 60 and 80 mL/min/1.73 m2, a thorough control of CKD risk factors is warranted.
The use of TDF, especially when co-administered with PIs, should be mentioned as a relative contraindication in presence of
at least one of these risk factors.

Introduction
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined by the National
Kidney Foundation as evidence of either kidney damage or
glomerular filtration rate (GFR) below 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 that
persists for at least 3 months [1]. CKD is an important risk factor
of cardio-vascular morbidity, hospitalizations and mortality, in the
general population as in HIV-infected patients [2,3]. Among
untreated HIV-infected individuals, the occurrence of renal
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 June 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 6 | e66223

impairment is mainly due to HIV-associated nephropathy
(HIVAN), although this was mainly described in black population
[4]. Since the widespread availability of combination antiretroviral
therapy (ART), HIVAN is rare but a longer survival of treated
HIV-infected patients may expose them to other harmful factors
for renal function. Therefore, in the ART era, the prevalence of
CKD may reach 5 to 10% in several observational studies [5–8].
Traditional risk factors of CKD previously identified in the
general population [9,10] are frequently reported among HIV
infected patients [6,11,12]. In addition, low CD4 count, high
plasma HIV RNA or a history of AIDS-defining diagnosis, have
been associated with a higher incidence of CKD [7,11–13].
The role of antiretroviral drugs on renal function is beneficial on
average but some specific drugs have nevertheless been identified
as nephrotoxic. Nephrotoxicity of indinavir, tenofovir and more
recently of boosted protease-inhibitors (PI/r) others than indinavir,
have been reported [11,14]. Moreover, concomitant exposure to
PIs has been associated with a larger TDF exposure [15], a slower
renal clearance of TDF [16] and a larger reduction of glomerular
filtration rate [17–22]. Recently, Kalayjan et al reported a higher
CKD risk when ART regimens contained tenofovir plus PI/r [23].
In a large ongoing clinic-based cohort of HIV-infected patients,
we analysed the respective role of traditional versus HIV-related
risk factors of CKD and the potential interaction between
exposure to TDF and boosted PIs.
Methods
Written informed consent was taken from all the study
participants. The study was approved by the Ethics committee
of Bordeaux University Hospital (Comite´ de protection des
personnes).
The ANRS CO3 Aquitaine Cohort is a prospective hospitalbased cohort of HIV-1 infected patients under routine clinical
management, initiated in 1987 in the Bordeaux University
Hospital and four other public hospitals in the Aquitaine region,
South Western France. Inclusion criteria are: adult patients of the
participating hospital wards with confirmed HIV-1 infection,
having at least one follow-up after the first report, and having
given informed consent. Visits occur usually every three months if
the patient is treated, every six months otherwise. Detailed
presentation of the cohort has been reported elsewhere [24].
Estimation of Kidney Function
As creatinine was measured using a kinetic compensated Jaffe
assay traceable to an Isotopic Dilution Mass Spectrometry (IDMS)
determination, and as ethnicity was not registered in our cohort,
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was estimated by the IDMStraceable MDRD equation without ethnicity [25]:
eGFR = 1756(serum creatinine mmol/L60.0113) 21.1546age
20.20360.742 (if female).
CKD-Epi Equation was not used as it is validated only with
enzymatic assays [26].
Eligibility Criteria
Patients were included in this analysis if they had a follow-up
visit between January 2004 and June 2012. Their follow-up was
taken into account until December 2012. Patients were not
included in this analysis if MDRD was not validated to estimate
GFR (pregnant women, Body Mass Index (BMI) ,18 kg/m2 or
BMI .30 kg/m2
, creatininemia ,30 mmol/L, ascites) or when
data were not sufficient enough to calculate MDRD formula, or if
their first eGFR measure was ,60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (i.e prevalent cases), or if they had less than two eGFR measures after a first
normal measurement.
Study Variables
Our main outcome was the incidence of chronic kidney disease
(CKD), defined as two eGFR measures ,60 ml/min/1.73 m2
three months apart.
Explanatory variables were either fixed or updated. Fixed
variables included gender, HIV transmission group (injection drug
user or other), initial eGFR (60–70, 70–80, 80–90 or .90 mL/
min/1.73 m2) and age (,45, 45–60 or .60 years). Updated
variables included BMI, AIDS stage, delay since HIV diagnosis,
having reached the AIDS stage, Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) coinfection (defined as the detection of anti-HCV antibodies at least
once at baseline or during follow-up), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) coinfection (defined as the detection of HBV antigen at least once),
history or presence of diabetes (defined by use of antidiabetic
drugs, or fasting glycaemia .11 mmol/L or diagnosis reported by
physician), history or presence of high blood pressure (defined by
the use of antihypertensive agents or systolic blood pressure
.140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure .90 mmHg or diagnosis
reported by physician), history or presence of hyperlipidemia
(prescription of lipid lowering drugs, or fasting total plasma
cholesterol .6.5 g/L or fasting triglyceridemia .2.2 g/L or
diagnosis reported by physician), plasma HIV1-RNA ($50
copies/mL), CD4 cell count and exposure to ART.
We computed the cumulative exposure to each class of ART
since enrolment in the ANRS CO3 Aquitaine Cohort including
nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), non-nucleoside
reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI), protease inhibitors (PI),
and to each individual ART. We used dichotomous variables (ever
vs never) to avoid biases due to the modification of drugs regimens
according to the evolution of renal function assessment (i.e
discontinuation of a specific drug when renal function deteriorates).
Statistical Analyses
Person-years accrued from inclusion in this analysis (January
2004 or after) until the earliest of chronic kidney disease, loss to
follow-up (LTFU) or close of the dataset (31 December 2012).
LTFU was defined as not having attended the clinic since at least
24 months while being alive and without CKD at the last visit.
Incidence rate of CKD was calculated as the number of cases of
CKD divided by the number of person-years of follow-up (PYFU).
Cumulative probability of having CKD was estimated by the
Kaplan-Meier method. Poisson regression models were used to
study determinants of CKD whether measured at baseline or
updated.
A multivariable final model was obtained by fitting a backward
selection procedure from an initial model containing all variables
with a p,0.25 in the univariable analyses. Statistical significance
for selection was set at 0.05.
Tenofovir exposure was processed in different ways. In a first
analysis, exposure to tenofovir was classified as ever/never as other
ART-exposures. In order to investigate our hypothesis about
increased nephrotoxicity of tenofovir when co-administrated with
PI, two additional analyses were performed:
– firstly, tenofovir exposure was classified in four categories:
never exposed, exposed less than 6 months, expose more than 6
months with joint exposure to PI during at least 6 months and
ever exposed more than 6 months without joint exposure to PI
during at least 6 months.
Risk Factors of CKD in HIV Infection
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 June 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 6 | e66223

– secondly (and despite biases mentioned above), cumulative
tenofovir exposure was classified in five categorical variables
[0–6 months, 6–12 with or without concomitant (at least 6
months) exposure to PI and .12 with or without concomitant
(at least 6 months) exposure to PI].
Results
Between January 2004 and December 2012, 5,283 patients had
at least one contact reported in the ANRS CO3 Aquitaine cohort.
Among them, 933 were excluded from the analysis for the
following reasons: estimation of eGFR by MDRD formula was not
applicable for 412 patients (pregnant women, Body Mass Index
(BMI) ,18 kg/m2 or BMI .30 kg/m2, creatinine concentration
,30 mmol/L, ascites, insufficient data to use and calculate
MDRD formula), 260 patients had MDRD ,60 mL/min and
were considered prevalent cases of CKD and 261 patients had less
than two eGFR measures after the first normal one. The main
characteristics which differ (p,0.05) between included and nonincluded patients were: male gender (74.4% in included patients vs
63.8%), diabetes (8.0% vs 3.9%), hyperlipidemia (40.2% vs
36.3%), high blood pressure (19.5% vs 10.5%), HCV co-infection
(26.6% vs 21.2%) and AIDS stage (24.4% vs 19.6%).
Baseline characteristics of the 4350 patients included in the
analysis are shown in table 1.
During a median duration of follow-up of 5.8 years (IQR 2.5–
7.5–) accounting for 21983 PYFU, CKD occurred in 209 patients
within a median time of 2.1 years (IQR 0.9–4.4). Incidence of
CKD was 0.95 cases per 100 PYFU, 95% CI (0.83–1.09). Median
annual eGFR decline in patients who progressed to CKD was
9.0 ml/mn/1.73 m2 [IQR: 3.8; 17.8].
Figure 1 shows that CKD occurred nearly always in patients
with baseline eGFR,80 mL/min.
Six hundred and eighty four patients (15.7%) were LTFU.
One hundred and eighty seven (5.9%) patients without CKD
died during follow-up and 22 (10.5%) among the 209 patients with
CKD.
At the end of follow-up (table 1), 96% of patients had received
ART (mean total cumulative exposure since enrolment in the
ANRS CO3 Aquitaine Cohort: 9.1 years) among whom 35%
jointly received tenofovir and a PI for at least 6 months any time
during follow-up: atazanavir/r (33%), lopinavir/r (31%), fosamprenavir (13%), nelfinavir (12%) saquinavir (8%), others (3%).
Factors significantly associated (p,0.05) with a higher incidence
of CKD in univariable analysis are shown in table 2. Among PIs,
indinavir (Incidence Rate Ratio: IRR = 1.8; 95% CI [1.4–2.5])
and atazanavir (IRR = 1.4 [1.0–1.8]) were also significantly
associated with CKD. Other PIs were not significantly associated
although a trend was observed for lopinavir (IRR = 1.3 [1.0–1.7],
p = 0.05).
In the multivariable analysis (Table 2), factors independently
associated with a higher incidence of CKD were: older age, female
gender, history or presence of diabetes, history or presence of
hyperlipidemia, history or presence of high blood pressure, current
CD4+ lymphocytes cell count ,200/mm3
, AIDS stage, baseline
creatinine clearance ,80 ml/mn and exposure to tenofovir
(IRR = 2.0; 95% CI [1.4–2.8]). When introduced individually in
the final model, none of individual PIs was significantly associated
with higher incidence of CKD, data not shown.
In a first additional analysis, taking into account concomitant
exposure $6 months of PIs and tenofovir, exposure to tenofovir
was associated with a higher incidence of CKD when coadministrated with PIs: IRR = 3.0 (95% CI [2.0–4.4]) vs 1.3
[0.9–2.0] without joint PIs (p,0.001), data not shown.
In a second additional analysis, taking into account cumulative
exposure to tenofovir, we found that tenofovir exposure .12
months was independently associated with a higher incidence of
CKD when concomitant exposure to PI was noticed: IRR = 3.0
(95% CI [2.0–4.4]) vs 1.3[0.9–1.9] without joint PIs (p,0.001).

Risk Factors of CKD in HIV Infection
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 June 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 6 | e66223

When cumulative exposure to tenofovir was between 6 and 12
months, the difference between risk of CKD, whether or not PIs
were concomitantly prescribed, was close to the statistical
significance [IRR: 4.3 and 1.8 respectively, p = 0.07].
Among 209 patients who developed CKD, 184 (88.0%) had a
baseline eGFR between 60 and 90 ml/min/1.73 m2 and 160
(76.6%) a eGFR between 60 and 80 ml/min/1.73 m2.
All patients developing CKD but four carried at least one non
HIV-related risk factors of CKD (female gender, age .45 years,
diabetes, hyperlipidemia, baseline MDRD ,80 mL/min/
1.76 m2), 186 (89.0%) carried at least two of them and 133
(63.6%) at least three. A distribution of these factors stratified by
exposure to tenofovir is shown in table 3.
Discussion
In a large clinic-based cohort of HIV-infected patients, we
report a two fold increase of incidence of CKD when tenofovir was
administered in combination with PIs (IRR = 3.1 vs 1.3 in the
absence of PIs).
We report an incidence rate of CKD (0.95% PYFU) very close
to those already reported in other cohorts; i.e 1.12% PYFU in the
John Hopkins HIV Clinical Cohort (using MDRD equation) and
1.05% PYFU in the EuroSIDA Cohort (using Cockcroft-Gault
formula) [7,11]. Among patients with incident CKD, the median
annual decline of eGFR was 9.0 ml/mn/1.73 2 which is of clinical
significance [27].
As others, we found that traditional risk factors (older age,
diabetes, hyperlipidemia and pre-existing mild renal dysfunction)
were associated with a higher incidence of CKD [3].
The impact of age reflects the physiological change of the
glomerular filtration rate when ageing. With improvement of life
expectancy in ART-treated HIV patients, an increasing number of
elderly patients is surviving with HIV and a high risk of CKD in
patients aged over 60 years can be observed: (IRR = 2.5 when age
.60 years compared to age ,45 years).
As expected, high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus and
hyperlipidemia had a deleterious role on the onset of CKD.
Therefore, these characteristics are important to consider in the
daily management given their high prevalence in patients
receiving ART and their modifiable nature. The potential
confounding role of PIs in the associations of metabolic disorders
with higher incidence of CKD was taken into account by
maintaining the inclusion of the use of PIs in the final multivariate
model.
More constantly than in HIV-negative population, women have
a higher incidence of CKD among HIV-infected individuals
[7,11,20]. Physiological differences between men and women may
explain such effect but we cannot exclude that the adjustment of
the simplified MDRD equation in females (i.e60.742), which takes
into account a lower relative muscle mass among women
compared to men, yield an overestimation of MDRD. Indeed,
differences in muscle mass between men and women may be lower
in HIV infected population because of their frequent sarcopenia
[28].

PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 June 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 6 | e66223

Specific HIV-related factor independently associated with a
higher risk of CKD in our study were, as reported by other
reports, history of AIDS [14,23] and a low current CD4 count
[11,14] The specific nephrotoxicity of AIDS-defining diseases
treatments or prophylaxis (such as the use of trimethoprimesulfamethoxazole) could not be assessed by lack of reliable data.
We chose to include current CD4 count rather than CD4 nadir as
the latter is often of unknown value when case management of
patients started prior to their enrolment in the ANRS CO3
Aquitaine cohort: we acknowledge that CD4 nadir could have
better revealed consequences associated with AIDS defining
conditions, which was nevertheless assessed in our study by taking
into account the history of AIDS stage.
In accordance with other cohort studies showing a deleterious
impact of tenofovir on renal function [11,17,20,22,29–31] we
found, as published by Mocroft et al [11] and more recently by
Scherzer et al. [32] a significant association between exposure to
tenofovir and higher incidence of CKD. This result does not

Risk Factors of CKD in HIV Infection
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 5 June 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 6 | e66223

contradict data from several clinical trials assessing the renal safety
of tenofovir as, in trials, patients have usually higher baseline
eGFR than in observational cohorts like ours where patients are
unselected, older with more risk factors such as hypertension,
diabetes and dyslipidemia [33,34]. Tenofovir may be associated
with glomerular and above all proximal tubular dysfunction
including development of Fanconi syndrome [35]. In a cross
sectional analysis performed in the same cohort, cumulative
exposure to tenofovir was associated with an increased risk of
proximal renal tubular function whether treatment was ongoing or
had been discontinued, leading to concern about the reversibility
of the phenomenon [36]. If many factors could influence the risk
of developing tubular dysfunction, Rodriguez-Novoa et al demonstrated an association between this dysfunction and the
homozygosity for the C allele at position 224 of the ABCC2 gene
encoding drug transporters [37] but this association was not
confirmed by several other investigations.
Conversely to the Euro-SIDA group study cohort [11], we did
not find an independent role of the protease inhibitors as a class in
our multivariable analysis. We found a significant impact of
exposure to ritonavir-boosted Protease Inhibitors either as a whole
or for some individual PI (indinavir, atazanavir and a tendency for
lopinavir) on the incidence of CKD, but only in the un-adjusted
analysis. Among PIs, Scherzer et al. mentioned an increased risk
of CKD only with indinavir [32] but Mocroft et al showed that a
longer cumulative exposure to indinavir/r, atazanavir/r or
lopinavir/r was associated with a higher rate of CKD. Nevertheless we observed that risk of CKD was higher when TDF was
taken concomitantly (during at least 6 months) with PIs than when
taken without concomitantly PIs, as relative risks of progression to
CKD were respectively 3.0 and 1.3. This result can be compared
to the report by Kalayjan et al. [23] who found that tenofovir plus
PI/r was associated with a higher risk of CKD (Hazard Odds
Ratio = 3.35 [95% CI, 1.40–8,02]). Moreover, when cumulative
exposure to tenofovir was taken into account, we found that a
concomitant tenofovir and PIs intake was associated with a higher
risk of CKD than exposure to tenofovir without PIs mainly when
cumulative exposure to tenofovir was .12 months. These findings
are consistent with those of other cohort studies showing that
patients receiving tenofovir in combination with PI/r had an
increase decline in renal function compared with those receiving
tenofovir and NNRTIs [17–22]. These results may have
significant clinical impact in the case management of tenofovirtreated patients as limiting or avoiding concomitant use of PI/r
might be important, mainly among those having other risk factors
of progressing to CKD, as in our study, no patient developed
CKD when exposure to tenofovir was the only risk factor of CKD.
PIs studied in our report were mainly the following boosted PIs:
atazanavir, lopinavir, fosamprenavir and saquinavir. We cannot
assert that our findings could be extrapolated to unboosted PIs or
more recently available drugs such as darunavir. The interaction
between TDF and PIs on nephrotoxicity in HIV-infected patients
should be confirmed in independent larger databases also in order
to examine whether this effect is homogeneous or not among
different PIs.
In few reports, where drugs were analysed individually,
zidovudine, didanosine and efavirenz were associated with
increased incidence of CKD [20,32]. In our report, where ART
were studied as a class, we did not find a deleterious impact of
exposure to NRTIs and NNRTIs.
Conversely to a recent report [38], we did not find any
association between HCV co-infection and progression to CKD,
but we were not able to distinguish patients with active HCV
infection as in the Eurosida Study.
The susceptibility to renal impairment of black patients,
considered as especially susceptible to HIVAN, could not be
evaluated in our study as ethnicity is not registered in our
database, where patients are mostly (.90%) white.
As in the Euro SIDA cohort, progressing to CKD was very
infrequent in our study when the estimated GFR at baseline was
above 90 mL/min/1.73 m2. The vast majority of patients who
developed CKD (77%) had a baseline estimated renal clearance

Risk Factors of CKD in HIV Infection

between 60 and 80 mL/min/1.73 m2. This level of eGFR
appeared to be the main contributing risk of the occurrence of
CKD. This result seems to us an important message that remains
somewhat under-appreciated by clinicians while it should have
implications for closer monitoring and specific care management
of HIV infected individuals. It seems moreover interesting to
notice that we found a relatively similar incidence of CKD during
each year of follow-up leading to a regular increase of the
cumulative risk over time. This evolution suggests that the
monitoring of the glomerular filtration rate needs to be regularly
performed throughout the follow-up regardless of the level of
initial measurement.
Presence of proteinuria, identifying early kidney renal dysfunction, was not assessed in our study. Although no study had
examined the usefulness of its systematic screening in HIV infected
individuals, there is some evidence that early recognition of
chronic renal impairment might be beneficial [39–41].
We know that the MDRD equation was developed in people
with CKD, and, as such, that its major limitations are imprecision
and systematic underestimation of measured GFR at higher levels
[25]. As these limitations are present among patients taking
tenofovir whether or not concomitant PIs intake, we think that
using MDRD formula may be associated with a non differential
measurement bias, leading statistical association measurements
(RR, IRR) to null value (i.e. 1). Finding IRR .1 actually reinforce
our significant results.
In conclusion, incidence of CKD occurs frequently among
treated HIV-infected patients and, with ageing of HIV-infected
population, might represent an important issue in terms of
mortality and incidence of cardiovascular diseases in the next
future. Regular assessment of renal function and evaluation of
other CKD risk factors are warranted in HIV-infected patients
from the time of HIV diagnosis [40] and should be taken into
account in the choices of ART. Our results provide evidence that,
in patients with eGFRs between 60 and 80 ml/mn/1.73 m2, a
thorough control of CKD risk factors (mainly high blood pressure,
diabetes and hyperlipidemia) is warranted and that use of TDF,
especially when co-administered with PIs, should be mentioned as
a relative contraindication in presence of additional risk factors of
CKD.
