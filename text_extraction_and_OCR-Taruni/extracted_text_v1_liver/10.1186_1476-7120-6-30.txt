Abstract
Background: Recent American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines
state that "dobutamine stress echo has substantially higher sensitivity than vasodilator stress echo
for detection of coronary artery stenosis" while the European Society of Cardiology guidelines and
the European Association of Echocardiography recommendations conclude that "the two tests
have very similar applications". Who is right?
Aim: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of dobutamine versus dipyridamole stress
echocardiography through an evidence-based approach.
Methods: From PubMed search, we identified all papers with coronary angiographic verification
and head-to-head comparison of dobutamine stress echo (40 mcg/kg/min ± atropine) versus
dipyridamole stress echo performed with state-of-the art protocols (either 0.84 mg/kg in 10' plus
atropine, or 0.84 mg/kg in 6' without atropine). A total of 5 papers have been found. Pooled weight
meta-analysis was performed.
Results: the 5 analyzed papers recruited 435 patients, 299 with and 136 without angiographically
assessed coronary artery disease (quantitatively assessed stenosis > 50%). Dipyridamole and
dobutamine showed similar accuracy (87%, 95% confidence intervals, CI, 83–90, vs. 84%, CI, 80–
88, p = 0.48), sensitivity (85%, CI 80–89, vs. 86%, CI 78–91, p = 0.81) and specificity (89%, CI 82–
94 vs. 86%, CI 75–89, p = 0.15).
Conclusion: When state-of-the art protocols are considered, dipyridamole and dobutamine
stress echo have similar accuracy, specificity and – most importantly – sensitivity for detection of
CAD. European recommendations concluding that "dobutamine and vasodilators (at appropriately high
doses) are equally potent ischemic stressors for inducing wall motion abnormalities in presence of a critical
coronary artery stenosis" are evidence-based.
Background
Pharmacological stress echocardiography is widely used
for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease [1,2], and the
two most employed pharmacological stresses are dipyridamole and dobutamine, first proposed more than 20
years ago [3,4]. The latest 2006 European Society of CarPublished: 19 June 2008

diology (ESC) guidelines for stable angina conclude that
"the two tests have very similar applications and the choice as
to which is employed depends largely on local facilities and
expertise" [5]. This statement was corroborated by a metaanalysis of the published literature, included in the guidelines, and showing comparable accuracy, sensitivity and
specificity of dobutamine and vasodilator stress echocardiography. However, and paradoxically, on the basis of
the same existing literature, the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) guidelines stated that "dobutamine stress echo has higher sensitivity
than vasodilator stress echo for detection of coronary artery disease" [6,7]. The recent 2007 recommendations on stress
echocardiography of the American Society of Echocardiography conclude that "although vasodilators may have
advantages for assessment of myocardial perfusion, dobutamine
is preferred when the test is based on assessment of regional wall
motion" [8]. Who is right? The question has profound clinical relevance, since tens of millions of cardiac stress testing are performed each year [9], and the projected rises is
of + 4,900% in the next decade or so [10]. In addition,
pharmacological stress imaging with simultaneous assessment of perfusion and function is also at the basis of the
growing application of stress-CMR imaging [11]. A source
of ambiguity is represented by the presence of several different protocols of vasodilator stress echo proposed over
the years, in the continuing quest of the ideal accuracy:
one protocol is suitable for perfusion imaging [12,13],
another for viability detection [14], and still another one
for ischemia induction [15-17]. When true ischemia and
regional wall motion abnormalities are the diagnostic
end-point, we need high dipyridamole doses (0.84 mg/
kg), either with atropine co-administration [16] or with a
fast infusion rate [17]. Any sound meta-analysis should
only include these state-of-the-art protocols, present in
the literature since 15 years [17], in a head-to head comparison with dobutamine stress echo on consecutive populations studied in the same laboratories and with
angiographic verification independent of stress results.
Methods
Study selection
We designed our search to identify all studies assessing the
comparison between dipyridamole and dobutamine
stress echocardiography state of the art protocols in their
diagnostic accuracy. We conducted a PubMed search from
1985 through 2007 combining stress echocardiography
(2777 citations) AND diagnosis (2665 citations) AND
dobutamine (1659 citations) AND dipyridamole (201
citations). In a second step we excluded "prognosis" (143
citations). After limiting to human studies we identified
86 citations. There was no language restriction used. Metaanalysis, editorials, letters have been excluded. We only
considered original papers addressing head to head comparison between dobutamine stress echo (40 mcg/kg/min
± atropine) and dipyridamole stress echo with state of the
art protocols (0.84 mg/kg plus atropine or 0.84 mg/kg in
6 minutes without atropine). The inclusion criteria for
this meta-analysis were:
(1) dipyridamole and dobutamine stress echocardiography were performed on the same population of patients,
on different days and in random order;
(2) the 2 tests were performed under identical antiischemic therapy, if any;
(3) coronary angiography information was used as a reference standard.
Based on this, 5 articles have been selected (from Serbia,
Holland, Spain, Italy and Finland) totalling 435 patients
with coronary angiography for evaluation of diagnostic
accuracy.
We followed the QUORUM guidelines on the reporting of
meta-analysis [18]. The selection process of the relevant
literature is summarized in Figure 1. Studies performed
with protocols not considered today as state-of-art (such
as high dose dipyridamole in 10' without atropine) have
been excluded [18-26]. Studies without angiographic
information and with only prognostic information available were also excluded [27-29]. Studies from the same
group were considered only once, to avoid partial recounting of data [29,30] and only the latest, and largest,
study was used as source study. Based on this selection criteria, 5 source studies have been selected (from Serbia,
Holland, Spain. Italy and Finland) totalling 435 patients
with coronary angiography for evaluation of diagnostic
accuracy [31-35]. A vessel was considered to have a significant obstruction ≥ 50% by quantitative or visual analysis
(Table. 1). At time of the tests, 282 patients were off antiischemic therapy; 77 patients had history of previous
myocardial infarction.
Data extraction
The following data were extracted per source study:
author, journal, year of publication, type of test, total
number of patients, mean age, proportion of men, proportion of previous myocardial infarction, prevalence of
significant disease, definition of significant disease, summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity. In addition to
these variables, the absolute number of true-positive,
false-negative, false-positive, and true-negative results
were extracted per source study.
Data synthesis
The pooled weighted estimation of sensitivity, specificity
and accuracy were reported in Table. 2. Calculations of
sensitivity, specificity and accuracy have been performed

Cardiovascular Ultrasound 2008, 6:30 http://www.cardiovascularultrasound.com/content/6/1/30

according to standard definitions and goal of a meta-analysis, with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals
(CI). We also calculated the pooled values of sensitivity,
specificity and accuracy weighted for sample size with
fixed effect model (Comprehensive Meta-Analysis program – Biostat Englewood, NJ). Differences in sensitivity,
specificity and accuracy have been compared by the oddsratio statistics. We expressed continuous data as mean ±
SD, and dichotomous variables as percentages. We considered statistically significant a P value < 0.05.
Results
Individual absolute numbers and percent values for each
study are reported in Table 1. Standard dose dobutamine
protocol (40 mcg/Kg/min) plus atropine was used in all 5
articles. High dose dipyridamole protocol (0.84 mg/kg in
10 minutes) with atropine was employed in 3 studies and
287 patients, and the fast accelerated protocol (0.84 mg/
kg in 6 minutes) in 2 studies and 148 patients. Raw data
of sensitivity (Figure 2), specificity (Figure 3), and accuracy (Figure 4) values for individual articles and in overall
cumulative analysis were not significantly different. Variance-weighted pooled analysis is shown in Table 3, again
showing similar values between the two tests.
Discussion
When state-of-the art protocols are considered, dipyridamole and dobutamine stress echo have similar accuracy,
and – most importantly – the same sensitivity for detection of CAD.
Comparison with previous studies
Several previous meta-analysis pooled data of dipyridamole stress echocardiography, including standard dose
with high dose and high dose plus atropine [36-39]. All
these studies concluded that dipyridamole has a higher
specificity than dobutamine, with a trend to lower sensitivity in less severe forms of single vessel disease. In the
most recent and updated of these meta-analyses, Heijenbrook et al. analyzed 58 patients series with dipyridamole
echo and 102 with dobutamine echo, and showed a very
similar overall accuracy, with higher specificity for dipyridamole (94.6% vs. 84.1% of dobutamine) and higher
sensitivity for dobutamine (81% for dobutamine and
71.9% for dipyridamole) [39]. These data can be easily
reconciled with the findings of the present study, since the
inclusion of old, now obsolete, vasodilator protocols,
such as low dose, or high dose without atropine, decreases
sensitivity without affecting specificity [26]. Our data also
explain the recent findings of stress-CMR, conceptually
germane but less operator-dependent than stress echo,
showing that the fast high dose dipyridamole protocol is
the best choice to catch "two birds with a stone", i.e. to
image function and perfusion ("two birds") in one sitting
with a single stress ("one stone") [40,41]. This approach
is obviously simpler than the "two birds, two stones"
approach (with separate testing of perfusion with adenosThe flow-chart of selection of so Figure 1 urce studies for the meta-analysis

ine and function with dobutamine). It is however imperative that your "stone" (stress) is of sufficient weight (high
cumulative dose) and thrown with sufficient speed (fast
infusion rate) in order to catch the two birds.
Pathophysiological basis
It seems counterintuitive that dipyridamole is a strong
coronary vasodilator which does not importantly increase
myocardial oxygen demand and is also a powerful
ischemic stressor. It is conventional wisdom that "as long
as the oxygen demand is not increased in these segments there
is no ischemia and consequently no wall motion abnormality"
[42]. It can appear even more puzzling that the same
active principle, given intravenously, is an effective antiischemic drug [43], a viability test capable to recruit contractile reserve through a direct metabolic cardioprotective
effect [14], a hyperaemic stressor with limited capacity to
evoke ischemia [12,13] and – at high, fast doses – a strong
ischemic stress [44]. Dipyridamole looks like a character
of an Agatha Christie's novel."Perfectly", said Poirot, "The
matter begins to clear up wonderfully! The murderer was a man
of great strength – he was feeble – it was a woman – it was a
right-handed person – he was a left-handed person. Ah, C'est
rigolo, tout ça!" [45]. The results of this meta-analysis may
help us to enter the second half of the Agatha Christie's
novel. Dipyridamole acts through accumulation of
endogenous adenosine, which is a key retaliatory metabolite [46] with a variety of anti-ischemic and cardioprotective effects [47-49] – but too much of a good thing can be
dangerous [50]. A low level, gradual exposure to adenosine – or even a high level exposure in absence of steal
prone anatomy – can have exert a powerful anti-ischemic
and cardioprotective effect, due to the "cold light" of
direct cardioprotective effects independent of flow
increase, mainly mediated by stimulation of high affinity
A1 and A3 myocardial receptors [50]. A higher level of
adenosine accumulation will induce a stronger hyperemic
effect: warm coronary vasodilation that will produce a differential tanning (myocardial tracer uptake or coronary
flow increase) of regions perfused by coronary stenoses of
different severity. This effect is achieved with standard
doses, through stimulation of A2a adenosine receptors on
coronary arterioles smooth muscle cells and is convenient
for hyperemic imaging [50]. At high doses, the A2a-mediSensitivity values in individual Figure 2 studies and cumulative analysis

ated pro-ischemic effect prevails. The exposure of stealvulnerable myocardium to excessive amount of adenosine
will "burn" the myocardium, with ischemia induction
which is the necessary end-point for vasodilator stress
echocardiography (Figure 5). In this context, the vulnerable "phototype" is represented by the presence of a coronary anatomy with tight stenosis (necessary for vertical
steal phenomena), especially with complex-type morphology (with endothelial damage reducing the epicardial dilatory effects of adenosine), and abundant coronary
collateral circulation (i.e., the anatomical background
enhancing horizontal-steal phenomena). The burning
effects of excessive coronary arteriolar vasodilation can be
effectively prevented, or attenuated, by anti-ischemic therapy with beta-blockers, nitrates, or calcium-antagonists,
which exert a powerful anti-steal effect, with enhanced
redistribution of hyperaemic flow towards the subendocardium [51], acting therefore as a protective "sunshade
umbrella" for the steal-prone myocardium. With this conceptual framework, we can enter the second half of the
Agatha Christie's novel: the same drug, in the same
patient, can have different effects according to the dose
employed, the infusion rate, and the underlying coronary
anatomy (Fig. 5).
Study limitations
We did not exclude studies based on the quality of data
reported. Juni et al showed that studies should not be
excluded based on composite quality scores because
many quality scales are more closely related to reporting
quality than to the internal validity of the studies [52].
Instead, relevant methodological aspects should be
assessed individually and their influence on effect sizes
explored. Therefore, we only included studies that used
the same anatomic reference standards, i.e. a (visually or
quantitatively assessed) coronary artery stenosis ≥ 50%
and with remarkably similar methodology regarding the
visual assessment of regional wall motion analysis.
Another potential confounder is the publication bias.
Stern and Simes have shown that positive results are not
only more likely to be published than negative results, but
they also have a significant shorter time to publication
[53]. However, in this particular case it is not clear what is

a positive finding, since 2 stress tests were compared, and
the results appear consistent across the different studies,
without detectable changes related to the year of the
study, the male predominance, the percentage of previous
myocardial infarction, the prevalence of CAD, or the concomitance of antianginal therapy. All these factors are
known to affect the stress test accuracy in absolute terms –
but in this study they are averaged out, since only intertest differences applied to the same population are considered.
We focused only on diagnostic accuracy. Other aspects of
the test are at least equally important and include the
prognostic value, the safety, the feasibility rate, the quality
of echocardiographic imaging and the capability to recognize myocardial viability. There are extensive data in the
literature that the prognostic accuracy of the 2 tests is very
similar [28,29,54,55], whereas the number of minor, but
limiting, and major life-threatening complications is
about 2 times higher with dobutamine than with dipyridamole [56-58]. Submaximal studies are found in 5%
patients with dipyridamole, and 10% with dobutamine.
Life-threatening complications occur in 1 out of 600
patients with high dose dipyridamole and 1 in 300 with
dobutamine [49,50]. Regarding image quality degradation during stress, only 2 studies – both not included in
the present metaanalysis since the high dipyridamole
dose without atropine was used – addressed semi-quantitatively [23] or qualitatively [21] the issue of image degradation during stress. Sochowsky et al described that a
worsening of image quality occurred significantly more
frequently during dobutamine than with dipyridamole
stress [23], due to tachycardia and hyperventilation. Beleslin et al compared head to head 136 patients with treadmill exercise, dobutamine and dipyridamole stress echo
and concluded that "from the technical viewpoint, dipyridamole represents the primary school, dobutamine the
secondary school, and exercise the University in the stress
echo cursus studiorum" [21]. For recognition of myocardial viability, both tests have similar diagnostic and prognostic value [59,60], but the wealth of data clearly favors
low dose dobutamine, which is currently the only stress
echo test with this class 1 indication for viability assessment in guidelines [5,6].

Conclusion
The recent ESC [5] guidelines on stable angina and EAE
recommendations on stress echocardiography [61] are
evidence-based in concluding that "dobutamine and
vasodilators (at appropriately high doses) are equally
potent ischemic stressors for inducing wall abnormalities
in presence of a critical coronary artery stenosis." The
implications are far-reaching for the better understanding
of pathophysiology of ischemic heart disease and the
practice of cardiac stress testing.
