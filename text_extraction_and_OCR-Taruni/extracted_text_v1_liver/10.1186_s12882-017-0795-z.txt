Abstract
Background: Despite pre-kidney-transplant cardiovascular (CV) assessment being routine care to minimise perioperative
risk, the utility of such assessment is not well established. The study reviewed the evaluation and outcome of a
standardised CV assessment protocol.
Methods: Data were analysed for 231 patients (age 53.4 ± 12.9 years, diabetes 34.6%) referred for kidney transplantation
between 1/2/2012-31/12/2014. One hundred forty-three patients were high-risk (age > 60 years, diabetes, CV disease,
heart failure, peripheral vascular disease) and offered dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE); 88 patients were low-risk
and offered ECG and echocardiography with/without exercise treadmill test.
Results: At the end of follow-up (579 ± 289 days), 35 patients underwent kidney transplantation and 50 were active on
the waitlist. There were 24 events (CV or death), none were perioperative. One hundred fifteen patients had DSE with
proportionally more events in DSE-positive compared to DSE-negative patients (6/34 vs. 7/81, p = 0.164). In 42 patients
who underwent coronary angiography due to a positive DSE or ischaemic heart disease symptoms, 13 (31%) had events,
6 were suspended, 11 removed from waitlist, 3 wait-listed, 1 transplanted and 17 still undergoing assessment. Patients
with significant coronary artery disease requiring intervention had poorer event-free survival compared to those without
intervention (56% vs. 83% at 2 years, p = 0.044). However, the association became non-significant after correction for CV
risk factors (HR = 3.17, 95% CI 0.51–19.59, p = 0.215).
Conclusions: The stratified CV risk assessment protocol using DSE in all high-risk patients was effective in identifying
patients with coronary artery disease. The coronary angiograms identified the event-prone patients effectively but
coronary interventions were not associated with improved survival.

Background
Atherosclerotic coronary artery disease is a welldocumented complication of renal disease with the incidence and severity increasing as the glomerular filtration
rate decreases [1, 2]. Coronary angiography (CA) in
asymptomatic patients with end stage renal disease
(ESRD) have shown coronary artery disease (defined as
luminal occlusion >50%) in between 37 and 58% [3–5].
In the general population without renal failure, it is
widely accepted that percutaneous coronary artery intervention in asymptomatic and stable coronary artery
disease (CAD) does not reduce mortality and may only
confer a modest improvement in quality of life that
dissipates over time [6–8]. These studies have largely
excluded patients with severe renal failure and therefore
these findings cannot be applied to these patients.
The gold standard treatment for patients with ESRD is
a kidney transplantation which offers better survival and
quality of life compared to other forms of renal replacement therapy [9]. However there is a significant risk of
cardiovascular (CV) events during transplantation and
the risk continues to be high before and after kidney
transplantation [10–14]. Death has been reported as the
leading cause of graft loss in patients aged above 40 years
with cardiovascular disease and infection responsible for
the majority [15].
Most transplant centres therefore implement a screening programme to identify asymptomatic patients with
coronary artery disease and treat with pharmacological
therapy, percutaneous coronary artery intervention (PCI)
or coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG) to reduce CV
events and exclude patients with very high risk from being
listed for transplantation. The ideal approach to cardiovascular screening is unknown and differs from centre to
centre. Some units have adopted a risk-stratified approach
using non-invasive techniques followed by coronary angiography for high risk patients only, others offer coronary
angiography to all potential transplant recipients undergoing evaluation [16–20]. However, the benefit of cardiovascular screening is unclear, particularly if this does not
result in coronary revascularisation and/or leads to delays
in transplantation.
The practice at our renal transplant centre is to evaluate
the cardiovascular risk pre-transplantation for all potential
kidney transplant recipients and offer coronary angiography
only to those with symptoms of myocardial ischaemia or
suggestion of cardiac ischaemia on dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the results of a standardised protocol, using DSE and
CA, to screen prospective renal transplant recipients for
coronary artery disease. Although we also examined the incidence of cardiac events among those who were screened,
this study could not address whether screening and preemptive intervention reduced the rates of those events.
Methods
This study was a retrospective cohort study. Data was
obtained using medical chart review. All prospective
renal transplant recipients were assessed according to
the same work-up protocol (Fig. 1). The clinical evaluation protocol used during the period of study was based
on published recommendations from European Renal
Best Practice, UK Renal Association and British Transplant Society, European Association of Urology and
American Society of Transplantation [21–24]. All patients referred for evaluation for suitability for cadaveric
or live-donor kidney transplantation between 1st February 2012 and 31st Dec 2014 were included. Each patient
underwent cardiac risk stratification and was assigned to
a ‘high-risk’ group, i.e. those older than 60 years of age
or 60 and below with at least one of the following
cardiac risk factors: diabetes, ischaemic heart disease,
peripheral vascular disease, congestive cardiac failure; a
‘low-risk’ group i.e. those patients aged between 40 to
60 years old with none of the mentioned cardiac risk
factors; and a ‘minimal risk’ group i.e. those younger
than 40 with none of these risk factors. The ‘low-risk’
group adopted in the data analysis comprised patients
belonging to the minimal-risk and low-risk cohorts of
the protocol. Other CV risk factors such as smoking history, family history of CV disease or dialysis duration
were not included in the protocol. After the risk stratification, cardiac investigations were requested according
to our recipient evaluation protocol (Fig. 1); high-risk
patients requiring DSE; minimal-risk patients below age
40 years undergoing transthoracic echocardiogram
(TTE); and low-risk patients between ages 40-60 years
requiring an exercise treadmill test (ETT). The low-risk
patients with positive or inconclusive exercise treadmill
test or abnormal TTE were assessed with DSE. The patients with positive DSE, symptomatic angina or acute
coronary syndrome (ACS) underwent coronary angiography. If the coronary lesions were felt to be amenable
to coronary stenting by the treating cardiologist, these
were deployed at the time of coronary angiography. For
more complex lesions, revascularisation strategy (i.e.
coronary stenting, CABG or pharmaceutical therapy)
was determined at a multidisciplinary meeting between
cardiology and cardiothoracic specialties. The caserecords of each patient were reviewed from the date of
referral to the end of the study.
A positive DSE was defined as one with ≥ 2 ischaemic
segments and significant CAD as coronary artery luminal stenosis ≥ 50%. Events included the standard definition for major adverse cardiovascular events and were
defined as the occurrence after referral for transplant
evaluation of a non-fatal cardiovascular event (myocardial infarction, unstable angina, congestive heart failure,
stroke, transient ischaemic attack and amputation) and

sudden cardiac death or death from any cause. Events
were captured by review of patient medical records and
out-of-hospital events reported by the patient to the
dedicated transplant coordinator who contacts the
prospective transplant recipients yearly.
The pre-transplant CV assessment is only one aspect
of a holistic approach to ensuring transplant candidate
suitability. Hence, successful completion of the CV assessment did not result in activation on the transplant
wait-list unless all aspects of the transplant candidate
work-up had been completed.
The results were analysed using the statistical software
package IBM SPSS (version 20). Continuous variables
were expressed as mean ± standard deviation except
where stated. Annual event rate (AER) represents the proportion of patients having events per year. The difference
between groups were analysed using chi-squared tests,
event-free survival estimated by Kaplan-Meier method
and the effect of DSE and coronary angiographic findings
were assessed using the cox-proportional hazard model
with correction for age, diabetes, ischaemic heart disease,
hypertension, stroke or Transient Ischaemic Attack (TIA),
cholesterol, Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT) modality
and cardiac medication. Results with a p value less than
0.05 were considered significant. The study was approved
as an audit by the St George’s Clinical Audit department
and hence exempted from formal ethics approval process.
Results
Characteristics of patients screened
Two hundred thirty-one patients were evaluated and
mean length of follow up was 579 ± 289 days. One hundred forty-three patients were deemed ‘high-risk’. As
shown in Table 1, these patients were older, had a higher
BMI and were more likely to have cardiovascular risk
factors. In total, 115 patients underwent a DSE, 42 CA,
31 ETT and 77 TTE. Figure 2 shows the number of patients belonging to the risk stratification groups adopted
for this study and their subsequent investigations.
At the end of follow-up, pre-transplant cardiac assessment was completed in 181 patients (70 in ‘low-risk’ and
111 in ‘high-risk’ groups); 50 patients were active on the
transplant wait-list (24 ‘low-risk’ and 26 ‘high-risk’) and
35 had received a transplant.
Events during follow up
There were a total of 24 events in 21 (9.1%) patients -
none in the perioperative period (Table 2). The mean

length of time to first event was 354 ± 197 days. The overall AER was 5.7% per year. Table 3 shows the characteristics of the patients who had and did not have events.
Patients who had events were older, more likely to have
diabetes, ischaemic heart disease and were more likely to
be on typical cardiac medications. Unsurprisingly, all but
one had been stratified as ‘high-risk’ (Table 3).
A total of 9 people died during the follow-up period.
Eight had been stratified as ‘high risk’. Causes of death
included myocardial infarction (1), intracerebral haemorrhage (1), sepsis (2), metatstatic cancer (1), cardiac arrest
of unknown cause (2) and unknown (2). One patient
belonged to the ‘low-risk’ cohort and died following an
intracerebral haemorrhage.
There were no events in the 35 patients who received
a kidney transplant during follow up. Of these, 18 were
high risk, 21 had DSE, 1 had CA, none had significant
CAD and none underwent preoperative coronary
intervention.
Patients undergoing Dobutamine stress
echocardiography
Although there were 143 patients in the high-risk group,
only 103 of these patients had a DSE. Eleven patients
went straight to coronary angiography thus bypassing
the need for DSE. The remaining 29 did not have a DSE
as they were deemed unsuitable for transplantation at
this stage (outstanding medical issues; stable eGFR) or
for the following reasons: patient undecided, missed
appointments, transferred to other unit or died.
Twelve low-risk patients had a DSE following an
abnormal TTE (e.g. regional wall motion abnormalities

and/or left ventricular dysfunction), positive or inconclusive ETT or were unable to do an ETT (e.g. poor
mobility). Three of the 12 low-risk patients had a
positive DSE of whom 2 had CA (1 awaiting CA)
which did not reveal CAD and none of these 12 had
events.
In total, 115 patients had a DSE of whom 34 (30%) were
positive (i.e. ≥ 2 ischaemic segments). Table 4 shows the
characteristics of patients who had a DSE. Patients with a
positive DSE were more likely to have diabetes and ischaemic heart disease as well as already be on antiplatelet
agents and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.
Thirty patients had both DSE followed by CA (26 DSE
positive). Out of the 26 patients with a positive DSE, 16
(62%) patients were found to have significant CAD (≥ 50%
stenosis) on CA. Four patients with negative DSE had CA
for the following reasons: severely impaired left ventricular
function on DSE (1), acute coronary syndrome after DSE
(2) and multiple cardiovascular risk factors (1). All 4
patients were found to have significant CAD with 3
requiring PCI and 1 referred for CABG. Three of these 4
patients had events (2 ACS and 1 death from sepsis). One
patient who had an ACS was awaiting CABG.
There were numerically more events but no statistical
difference in patients with a positive DSE i.e. Six of 34

5.4%) with a negative DSE (Pearsons Chi-square p =
0.164). Patients who had a positive DSE had 94% and
85% event-free survival at 1 and 2 years respectively
compared to 96% and 91% in those patients with a negative DSE (log rank p = 0.193, Fig. 3). Similarly, using a
Cox proportional hazard analysis, the risk for events was
not significantly different between DSE positive patients
compared to DSE negative patients (HR = 0.573, 95% CI
0.093 – 3.527, p = 0.549).
Patients undergoing coronary angiography
Forty-two patients had CA of whom 30 (71.4%) were
found to have significant CAD. Eighteen of 42 (42.9%)
patients went on to have PCI or were referred for CABG
and 13 patients had events (AER 19.5%). Events were
predominantly ACS (8), but also included stroke or TIA
(1), amputation (1) and all cause deaths (4). One death
was due to ischaemic heart disease, 2 due to sepsis and
1 due to an unidentifiable cause. Seven patients were referred for CABG. Three of these 7 patients had had
CABG during follow up. There were 2 events in 2 patients awaiting CABG (1 death of unknown cause and 1
ACS). Overall there were 6 ACS, 1 stroke and 1 death in
the patients requiring coronary intervention.
Event rates were numerically higher but statistically
not significant in patients requiring coronary artery
intervention i.e. PCI or CABG (8 out of 18, AER 28.0%)
compared to those who did not require intervention (5
out of 24, AER 13.1%; Pearson Chi-square p = 0.101).

and 2 years when compared to those patients with significant CAD requiring coronary intervention (100% and
83% vs 67% and 56%, log rank p = 0.044). However,
using a cox proportional hazard analysis, the risk for
events was no longer significantly different (HR = 3.17,
95% CI 0.512 – 19.591, p = 0.215).
Eleven patients had CA without a prior DSE (10 for
cardiac symptoms and 1 for impaired left ventricular
function in association with significant cardiac risk factors) and 6 of these 11 were found to have significant
CAD requiring intervention (2 PCI and 4 referred for
CABG). Two patients had acute coronary syndrome
events and 1 died of an unknown cause.
In the 42 patients who had CA, only 1 patient with
mild (<50% stenosis) single-vessel CAD received a
transplant (no events at end of the follow-up period), 3
patients were active on the transplant waitlist, 6 were
suspended (1 awaiting CABG, 2 on dual-anti-platelets, 1
awaiting CA after repeat DSE was positive and 2 undergoing further medical investigations), 11 were removed
from waitlist (10 medically unfit, 1 declined CABG),17
are still undergoing assessment, 1 was transferred to
another centre and 4 died.
Low risk patients
Eighty-eight patients were stratified as low-risk. Thirtyone had ETT and 77 had TTE. Twelve patients had DSE
for abnormal/suboptimal ETT or abnormal TTE (7) or
were unable to do an ETT (5). Three DSEs were positive
and 2 subsequently had CA which revealed no CAD (1

CA pending). None of the 5 DSEs done without a prior
ETT or TTE were positive. There was only 1 event in
the low-risk group which was a death caused by an intracerebral haemorrhage (AER 0.7%). Ten patients did
not have an ETT or TTE (5 had DSE because of inability
to perform an ETT, 1 waiting for DSE, 3 stable renal
function and therefore further assessment currently
postponed and 1 missed several appointments).
Discussion
The major findings in this “real life” study of protocol
driven CV work-up for all kidney transplant recipients
were as follows. Firstly, risk stratification identified 143
(62%) potential renal transplant recipients as high-risk
who underwent DSE and if necessary CA yet only 18
(12.6%) underwent coronary artery intervention or
CABG. Secondly event rates in the low-risk group were
minimal (AER 0.7%) indicating that clinical risk stratification was an effective tool to avoid unnecessary testing
in these patients. Thirdly, 74% of cases with a positive
DSE had CAD on CA suggesting a positive DSE was at
least a fair predictor of CAD on CA.
The event rate amongst the low-risk patients in this
study is very low (0.7% per year). Indeed, there was only
one event in this group. The process of risk stratifying potential renal transplant recipients at the onset of the evaluation process correctly identifies those patients least likely
to have cardiovascular events or death from any cause
around the transplantation period and during follow-up.
Unsurprisingly these patients are younger and less likely
to have important cardiovascular risk factors such as previous ischaemic heart disease, diabetes and tend to have a
lower BMI. However, we also recognise duration of
follow-up for this group was 569 ± 285 days which when
compared to previous studies is much shorter. Kasiske et
al. [16] report an incidence of 0.5% in the first year for
low-risk patients not screened for CV disease (13 patients
had a coronary event out of 224 patients during a mean
follow-up of 88 months) and Lewis et al. [17] reported 1
of 94 patients belonging to their low-risk group having a
cardiac death during a mean follow-up of 28 months. In
another study of 600 patients undergoing renal transplantation, Patel et al [18]. reported 19/426 patients in their
low-risk group having CV events over a mean follow-up
of 42 months. The mean length of follow-up for this study
was 579 ± 289 days and a longer follow-up period may
yield more events, but the available data suggest the event
rates will remain low in a low CV risk group. Transplantation may further improve the CV risk profile for these
patients thus they should be considered for activation on
the kidney transplant waitlist without further delay in
keeping with ACC/AHA guidelines for perioperative CV
evaluation in non-cardiac surgery and European Renal
Best Practice Guidance [21–25].
Contrary to the above, event rates occur more frequently in patients with high CV risk and in our study
all but one event were in the high-risk group (23 events
in 20 patients out of 143 patients; AER 8.9%). Several
studies have evaluated the appropriateness of DSE in
evaluation of CAD in the general population [26–28]
and in patients with ESRD [29, 30]. In a relatively small
study of 50 renal transplant candidates, Herzog et al.
[29] reported high sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of DSE in
predicting CAD; 52%, 74%, 70% and 57% respectively for
coronary artery stenosis of 50%; and 75%, 71%, 45% and
90% respectively for stenosis greater than 70%. Similarly,
Sharma et al. [27] reported sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of
88%, 94%, 86% and 95% respectively in detecting coronary artery disease (stenosis >70%) in patients with ESRD.
Admittedly the two studies are small and evidence may
not be generalisable. In this study, 62% of all patients
with a positive DSE were found to have significant CAD
on CA. Four patients with a negative DSE had a CA and
all were found to have significant CAD (3 requiring coronary intervention). These patients belonged to the
high-risk group and the indications for CA were strongly
suggestive of unstable CAD (2 ACS, 1 severely impaired
left ventricular function and multiple CV risk factors
with previous ACS and PCI). Thus, the occurrence of
symptoms even after negative DSE merit further invasive
investigations.
Our study relies on DSE as a non-invasive test, which
is supervised by a single operator who is a cardiologist
with an interest in the pre-transplant population. However other non-invasive tests have been utilised such as
MPS, PET and SPECT. DSE, MPS and SPECT have
similar sensitivities in detecting coronary artery disease
[31]. PET scanning has the ability to show coronary flow
reserve in addition to ischaemia for better prediction of
adverse outcomes. However, most centres rely on DSE
or MPS [31].
In the present study, there was a non-significant trend
toward worse event-free survival in patients with a
positive DSE compared to patients with a negative DSE
(Fig. 3). This is consistent with Herzog et al. [29] who
reported 6 events (20%) in 30 negative DSE patients and
11 (55%) events in 20 patients with positive DSE with an
average follow-up of 22 ± 10 months.
In the present study, CA was offered to patients with a
significant ischaemic burden on DSE with the goal to
identify angiographic significant CAD lesions and offer
definitive treatment as appropriate. The majority underwent PCI and a few (7) were referred and even fewer (3)
had CABG during follow-up. The decision for CA intervention was taken by the interventional cardiologist at
the time of angiography based on visual determination
Ramphul et al. BMC Nephrology (2018) 19:2 Page 9 of 12

of CAD stenosis and was therefore a subjective decision.
Pressure-wire studies were occasionally used in borderline cases. The goal of pre-emptive revascularisation was
to reduce risk of CV events perioperatively and allow activation on the waitlist. However, there was significantly
worse event-free survival in patients with significant
CAD requiring intervention compared to those not requiring intervention. This observation is supported by
Herzog et al. [29] who reported significantly worse
cardiac event-free survival in patients with at least one
stenosis ≥ 50% and Patel et al. [19] who reported 99 patients undergoing CA with 17 undergoing PCI or CABG
and no significant difference in mortality between those
patients undergoing PCI or CABG compared to those
who underwent CA without intervention or no CA.
Thus the results of screening were important predictors
of survival, but did not lead to event-free survival benefit
with intervention and perhaps did little more than exclude some patients from transplantation. This is in
keeping with trials in the non-ESRD population which
have shown that prophylactic coronary artery revascularization in asymptomatic patients does not reduce allcause mortality or improve outcomes in high-risk
patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgery [6, 32].
Overall there were 6 ACS, 1 stroke and 1 death in the
patients requiring coronary intervention. This is more
likely to be a reflection of high CV disease burden and
coexisting comorbidity amongst these patients and suggests these most-at-risk patients were correctly identified
in the pre-transplant assessment.
Thus, there is little evidence in support of more invasive
CV assessment with CA and coronary intervention in patients evaluated for kidney transplantation. The case for
CA for all, however, has been put forward by Kumar et al.
[20] where cardiac event-free survival amongst those who
underwent intervention (n = 168) was particularly high,
98% and 88% at 1 and 3 years respectively as opposed to
75% and 35% in patients who declined intervention (n = 16,
with similar baseline characteristics) with 10 of 16 deaths
attributed to a cardiac cause. Only 1 of 20 (5%) and 1 of 30
(3.3%) of their patients died of CV causes whilst on the
waitlist or after transplantation respectively. Although there
were no reported complications of CA including decline in
renal function requiring premature renal replacement therapy in this study, this remains a concern when considering
CA. Whether coronary intervention in CKD patients with
moderate ischaemia on non-invasive stress testing is useful
will be addressed in the ongoing ISCHAEMIA- Chronic
Kidney Disease trial (NCT01985360) due to report in 2019.
The limitations of this study includes a short followup period resulting in fewer cardiovascular events overall. However, the main conclusions of this study are unlikely to change significantly with a longer follow-up as
suggested by the available literature. Some CV risk
factors such as dialysis duration and length of diabetes
were not included in the data analysis as this data was
not available. Although a few patients did not follow the
protocol strictly, this did not alter their pathway through
the CV assessment and is unlikely to have a significant
impact on the results of this study. An observational
study such as this to investigate impact of coronary
intervention in asymptomatic patients with CAD has
significant limitations due to lack of randomisation and
a parallel non-intervention group.
Given that, coronary artery intervention in asymptomatic individuals with CAD is not recommended in the general population [6–8], the current practice for screening
these asymptomatic patients prior to transplantation is
questionable especially as there has been no conclusive
evidence of benefit in the studies reported to date.
However, with cardiovascular event rates and death from
cardiovascular disease a leading cause of morbidity and
mortality following transplantation [10–15], this practice
has been widely adopted in the transplant community in
the belief that recognition and intervention will result in
lower cardiovascular events and death.
The study demonstrates that the standardised protocol
is successful in identifying the patient with high risk, and
non-invasive testing identifying the patients at highest risk,
however the role of intervention is not clear as these patients remained the most at risk. It is for these highest risk
patients that a randomised control trial is required to identify the few patients who may benefit from intervention.
Renal transplantation confers better long-term survival
and quality of life compared to patients awaiting
transplantation [9] and therefore should be available to all
suitable prospective recipients. Until better evidence for
cardiovascular disease risk management emerges, the decision for coronary revascularisation, optimisation of medical management and transplantation should be made on a
case by case basis and involve transplant and nephrology,
cardiology and cardiothoracic teams.
Conclusion
The study suggests that using a standardised protocol to
identify high-risk patients with DSE for screening is effective at identifying those patients with coronary artery disease in a cohort referred for kidney transplantation. The
coronary angiogram triggered by positive DSE or clinical
symptoms, correctly identifies the patients likely to suffer
from death and CV disease during follow-up but coronary
intervention does not seem to alter prognosis. Given CV
disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in
potential transplant recipients on the waitlist and after
transplantation, the role of coronary angiography and coronary intervention which are costly, not without risk and
generously employed in this context need to be evaluated
in prospective randomised trials.
