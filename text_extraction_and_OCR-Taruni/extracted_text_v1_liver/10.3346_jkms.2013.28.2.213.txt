Feasibility and Efficacy of Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy for 
Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer-C Stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma
The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility and efficacy of stereotactic ablative 
radiotherapy (SABR) for liver tumor in patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC)-C 
stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 
35 patients between 2003 and 2011. Vascular invasion was diagnosed in 32 patients, 
extrahepatic metastases in 11 and both in 8. Thirty-two patients were categorized under 
Child-Pugh (CP) class A and 3 patients with CP class B. The median SABR dose was 45 Gy 
(range, 30-60 Gy) in 3-5 fractions. The median survival time was 14 months. The 1- and 
3-yr overall survival (OS) rate was 52% and 21%, respectively. On univariate analysis, CP 
class A and biologically equivalent dose ≥ 80 Gy10 were significant determinants of better 
OS. Severe toxicity above grade 3, requiring prompt therapeutic intervention, was 
observed in 5 patients. In conclusion, SABR for BCLC-C stage HCC showed 1-yr OS rate of 
52% but treatment related toxicity was moderate. We suggest that patients with CP class 
A are the best candidate and at least SABR dose of 80 Gy10 is required for BCLC-C stage.

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly prevalent disease 
in many Asian countries including Korea, accounting for 80% of 
the cases worldwide (1). Screening programs improve the detection of early HCC and have a positive impact on survival, but 
the majority of HCC patients in Asia still present with advanced 
stage disease (2). However, there is no consensus guideline in 
Asia; and most Asian countries follow their own HCC staging 
system. In Korea, the Clinical Practice Guidelines for HCC management, introduced in 2003 and revised in 2009, are followed 
(3). Although the Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the 
Liver proposed a treatment algorithm for HCC to develop a consensus management strategy, this algorithm is not thoroughly 
validated (4). On the other hand, the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system has been externally validated in the 
USA, Europe, and Taiwan, and is endorsed by both the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the European Association for the Study of the Liver (5-9). 
According to the BCLC system, sorafenib, which is the first 
targeted agent with survival benefits proven by 2 large, randomized clinical studies, is the standard treatment for patients with 
BCLC-C stage (10, 11). However, sorafenib for BCLC-C stage is 
still not easy for Asian physicians to prescribe due to high cost 
(2). In Korea, sorafenib has been subsidized by the National Insurance Scheme since 2011. Among patients with advanced 
HCC, those unsuitable for local treatment or with inoperable 
lesions are eligible for 1 yr. Therefore, according to the treatment 
algorithm of Korea, not only sorafenib, but also other therapeutic options, including surgical resection, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) or external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) 
could be indicated for treating advanced HCC (Fig. 1).
Previously, the role of EBRT for HCC has been limited because of the low tolerance of the whole liver to RT and the risks 
of radiation-induced liver disease (12). However, further radiotherapeutic developments have gradually expanded EBRT indication from a palliative to a curative modality, whereby high 
dose can be delivered to the tumor more safely, without adversely affecting liver function (13). Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is an emerging treatment method that enables 
high precision and high dose to the tumor using a small number of fractions. The Korea Cancer Center Hospital has used 
SABR to treat patients with HCC since 2003. Recently we have 
reported the promising outcomes of SABR in patients with inoperable HCC previously treated with incomplete TACE (14, 15). 
In this study, we assessed the feasibility and efficacy of SABR for

liver tumor in patients with BCLC-C stage HCC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with 
HCC treated with SABR between 2003 and 2011 at the Korea 
Cancer Center Hospital. We found 35 patients with BCLC-C 
stage HCC, who were treated with SABR for liver lesion. All patients presented Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 
performance status of 1 or 2 and had either vascular invasion 
(VI) or extrahepatic metastases (EHM) confirmed by computed 
tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). 
SABR technique
Planning CT with free breathing for SABR was performed with 
each patient in the supine position with both arms raised above 
the head. Thin-slice CT scanning was performed with a slice 
thickness of 2 mm, and the data were entered into the CyberKnife 
planning system (Accuray Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA) in 12 patients or the Eclipse treatment planning system (Varian Medical 
Systems, Palo Alto, CA, USA) in 23 patients. Entire visible lesions 
were included for radiation target in 18 patients (curative field). 
Otherwise, part of the visible lesions was included in 17 patients 
(palliative field): VI only (8 patients); primary HCC only (6 patients); primary HCC and EHM (2 patients); and VI and EHM (1 
patient). Gross tumor volume (GTV) was identified and contoured on the axial CT images. Sometimes, MRI and PET/CT 
scan were used to delineate the GTVs accurately. GTV was considered to be equal to the clinical target volume (CTV). Planning 
target volume (PTV) was defined as CTV plus 4 mm in the longitudinal direction and CTV plus 2 mm in all other directions. 
Radiation doses were prescribed at 56%-83% isodose line of the 
maximum dose in CyberKnife and at 91%-100% in RapidArc to 
cover at least 95% of the PTVs. 
We adopted the following constraints: 1) at least 700 mL of 
the normal liver (entire liver minus PTV) had to receive a total 
dose of < 17 Gy in 3 fractions; 2) the maximum dose to the spinal cord should not exceed 22 Gy in 3 fractions and 0.25 mL or 
less of irradiated volume of the spinal cord > 18 Gy in 3 fractions. 
Besides, although other normal tissue constraints were not considered, dosages to the kidney, colon, and stomach were restricted to the lowest levels as possible. 
Various fractionation schedules were used considering the 
expected morbidity based on the target volume, the patients’ 
performance, and normal tissue constraints. Total SABR doses 
were converted into biologically equivalent dose (BED) for the 
comparison purpose, assuming that α/β was 10 Gy.

Follow-up after SABR
All patients were regularly followed up at 1 month after the completion of SABR and then at 2-3 month intervals with CT or PET/ 
CT. Radiographic in-field tumor responses were evaluated by 
CT performed 1 month after SABR. Complete response (CR) 
was defined as the disappearance of contrast enhancement in 
the tumor during the arterial phase according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumor. A partial response 
(PR) was defined as a decrease in volume of an enhancing area 
by > 30% of the initial tumor size. Stable disease (SD) was defined as a decrease in initial tumor volume < 30%, and progressive disease (PD) as defined as an increase in tumor volume 
≥ 20%. As various target volumes (curative or palliative field) 
were applied, the further recurrences in RT field following SABR 
were classified in-field failure. Treatment related toxicity was 
scored according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0. 
Statistical analysis
Survival rates were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and 
the groups were compared using the log-rank test. Multivariate 
analysis was performed to assess the relationships between the 
overall survival (OS) and the possible prognostic variables using the Cox proportional hazards model. All calculations were 
performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 
software version 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), and P values 
< 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Ethics statement
This study was approved of permission by the institutional review board of Korea Institute of Radiological & Medical Sciences (IRB No. K-1206-002-029). Informed consent was waived by 
the board.
RESULTS
Patients’ characteristics
Thirty-five patients, treated with SABR for liver lesion of BCLCC stage HCC between 2003 and 2011, were retrospectively reviewed. Thirty-three patients received various courses (range, 
1-9 courses) of previous treatments, including surgery, radiofrequency ablation, TACE and SABR. The age range of the patients was 34 to 67 yr (median age, 56 yr). There were 30 males 
(86%) and 5 females (14%). Twenty-six patients (74%) presented ECOG performance status of 1 and 9 (26%) presented of 2. 
Twenty-four patients (69%) had VI, 3 (8%) had EHM and 8 (23%) 
had both VI and EHM. Among the patients with EHM, 8 had 
regional lymph node (LN) metastases, 2 had lung metastases 
and 1 had adrenal metastases. Before SABR, 2 patients with lung 
metastasis received chemotherapy or sorafenib. At SABR, 5 patients with LN metastases and 1 patient with adrenal metastases also was treated with SABR for the metastatic lesion. On the 
other hand, 3 patients did not receive local treatment for LN metastases; 2 patients treated with further TACE and 1 patients 
treated with sorafenib after SABR. According to the Child-Pugh 
(CP) class, 32 patients (91%) had class A and the remaining 3 
(9%) class B (CP score of 7 in 2 patients; 8 in 1). Liver cirrhosis 
was present in 23 patients (66%). The alpha-feto protein levels 
ranged from 1 to 338100 IU/mL (median, 183 IU/mL). Main portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) was observed in 8 patients 
(23%). The median PTV was 131 mL (range, 21-2,189 mL). The 
median SABR dose was 45 Gy (range, 30-60 Gy). The number of 
fraction was 3 in 21 (60%), 4 in 11 (31%) and 5 in 3 patients (9%). 
When the total SABR doses were converted into BED, the median BED was 101 Gy10 (range, 58-180 Gy10). Twenty patients 
(57%) received further treatment after SABR.
Radiographic in-field tumor response after SABR
One patient (3%) achieved CR 1 month after SABR. Ten patients 
(28%) had a PR, 21 (60%) had SD and 3 (9%) had PD. The objective response rate (defined as CR plus PR) was 31%. During follow-up, 10 patients (29%) experienced in-field failure. The infield failure free survival rates at 1- and 3-yr were 69% and 51%, 
respectively. 
Overall survival and prognostic factors
The median follow-up period after SABR was 14 months (range, 
1-44 months). The median survival time was 14 months. The 
OS rates at 1- and 3-yr were 52% and 21%, respectively (Fig. 2). 
On univariate analysis, CP class and BED were significant determinants of OS (Table 1). Fig. 3 shows OS according to CP class 
and BED. On multivariate analysis, CP class (hazard ratio = 8.26, 
P = 0.042) was the only significant prognostic factor for OS.

major cause of death with 15 cases. One patient died of a combination of SABR-related toxicity and intrahepatic progression. 
One patient died of complication of underlying liver cirrhosis 
without disease progression and 1 patient died of pneumonia 
associated with lung metastases. One patient died of aortic dissection without disease progression, while no information was 
available for 3 patients. 
Treatment-related toxicity 
Eight patients (23%) experienced toxicity of CTCAE grade ≥ 3. 
Three patients had grade 3 elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Among these, 1 patient also had grade 3 hyperbilirubinemia. However, all patients had pre-existing grade 2 elevation of AST or hyperbilirubinemia and experienced progression 
of intrahepatic HCC. There were 5 patients (14%) with severe 
toxicity, requiring prompt therapeutic intervention (Table 2). 
Grade 3 hepatic failure without progression of intrahepatic HCC, 
and colonic ulcer were developed in each 1 patient 1 month after SABR. One patient experienced grade 4 myelitis 18 months 
after SABR. One patient suffered from panperitonitis due to 
grade 4 gastric perforation but he refused operation and received 
conservative management at the hospital. One patient experienced 2 severe toxicities. He underwent hemicolectomy due to 
grade 4 colonic perforation at 3 months and received transfusion due to duodenal ulcer bleeding at 5 months. He eventually 
died from hypovolemic shock. However, it was difficult to conclude that the cause of death was absolutely attributable to the 
treatment related toxicity because he had progression of intrahepatic HCC and also suffered from aspiration pneumonia. 
DISCUSSION
This is the first study to evaluate the efficacy of SABR for BCLC-C 
stage HCC with the largest population. Table 3 shows recently

published reports of various treatment modalities for BCLC-C 
stage (9-11, 16-20). The median survival time of BCLC-C stage 
was 2-28 months. One-year and 3-yr OS rates were 6%-70% and 
1%-41%, respectively. The best treatment outcome was associated with surgery. However, surgery is indicated in highly selected patients among BCLC-C stage. Vitale et al. (16) reported 
that liver transplantation could result in survival benefit for patients with HCC and advanced liver cirrhosis (BCLC-D stage) 
and in those with intermediate tumors (BCLC-B/C stage), regardless of the nodule number-size criteria, provided that macroscopic VI and EHM were absent. Yang et al. (17) evaluated 
long-term outcomes of surgical resection in patients with BCLCC stage. In this study, 314 patients (61%) were diagnosed with 
BCLC-C stage not because of the presence of VI or EHM but because of ECOG performance status of 1-2. One hundred ninetyseven patients with VI and/or EHM had a lower 1- and 3-yr OS 
rate than the other 314 patients (48% and 17% vs 84% and 56%). 
Recently, improvement in radiotherapy technique has allowed 
RT to be used as an alternative treatment option for primary 
HCC. With regard to BCLC-C stage, RT for PVTT, in particular, 
shows good responses with the promising outcomes (13, 18, 
19). Our study showed the median survival time of 14 months, 
and 1- and 3-yr OS rates of 52% and 21%, respectively. This result is comparable with other published reports, especially those 
that employed sorafenib: a multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor 
(10, 11). Therefore, SABR would be considered a treatment option for BCLC-C stage, especially in Asian countries, where there 
is a practical limitation on the use of sorafenib. 
Our study showed that CP class was the most significant prognostic factor for OS on univariate and multivariate analysis.

Child-Pugh class is generally considered as one of the most important prognostic factors, because HCC is a complex neoplasm 
inserted on a preneoplastic cirrhotic liver and thus variables of 
both diseases leading to death should be taken into account (21). 
In very early, early or intermediate stages, the best candidates 
for curative treatment are patients with CP class A. In intermediate stage, patients with hepatic decompensation or failure (CP 
class B or C) are not considered as the candidate for TACE because ischemic insults can lead to severe adverse events in these 
cases (22). In current study, 3 patients with CP class B received 
SABR. They eventually died from hepatic decompensation accompanied by infection or progression of intrahepatic HCC at 1, 
3, and 5 months. Therefore, we suggest CP class A is the best 
candidate for SABR in patients with BCLC-C stage.
While several studies have showed promising results using 
various SABR doses, there is no standard SABR dose for optimal 
tumor control in HCC. Kwon et al. (23) reported a 2-yr local control rate of 72% with a median dose of 33 Gy (range, 30-39 Gy) 
in 3 fractions for primary HCC treated with SABR. Andolino et 
al. (24) reported a 2-yr local control rate of 87% with a median 
dose of 40 Gy (range, 24-48 Gy) for CP class A and 44 Gy (range, 
30-48 Gy) for CP class B in 3-5 fractions. On the other hand, in 
our hospital, SABR dose for HCC was escalated from 33 to 57 Gy 
in 3 fractions and 2-yr local control rate was 66% (14). Dose of 
SABR ≥ 42 Gy was the only significant prognostic factor for OS. 
Because we observed several local recurrences at 51 or 54 Gy, 
we escalated SABR dose to 60 Gy in 3 fractions and recently published results of a phase 2 clinical trial (15). The 2-yr local control rate was 95% with median dose of 57 Gy (range, 42-60 Gy) 
in 3 fractions. In current study, SABR dose of BED ≥ 80 Gy10
was a significant prognostic factor for OS on univariate analysis. 
Based on our experience, a higher SABR dose would be needed 
to achieve optimal treatment outcomes. However, there are limitations on an application of higher SABR dose in BCLC-C stage 
because of the proximity of tumor in the gastrointestinal track, 
the larger extent of disease and the smaller normal liver volume. 
Based on aforementioned and current studies, SABR dose of at 
least 80 Gy10 would be required to achieve a considerable treatment outcome for BCLC-C stage and higher dose ≥ 80 Gy10
would be indicated in selected patients according to tumor site 
and normal tissue constraints.
There are no guidelines to indicate whether to target visible 
lesions entirely or partially for BCLC-C stage because most patients have huge and infiltrative HCC. Kim et al. (18) reported 
outcomes of 3-dimentional conformal RT (3D-CRT) in 70 patients with unresectable HCC for whom TACE was ineffective 
or not indicated. Portal vein tumor thrombosis was present in 
41 patients. All gross lesions (PVTT plus HCC) were included 
within radiation field. The median survival time was 9 months 
in HCC patients with PVTT. Yoon et al. (19) reported 3D-CRT 
plus TACE in 412 patients with HCC invading PVTT. Only PVTT 
was included within radiation field in 343 patients (83%). The 
median survival time was 11 months. The former with 3D-CRT 
alone for entire visible lesion and the latter with combination of 
limited field RT and TACE showed the similar promising result. 
In our study, there was no difference in survival between patients with curative field and patients with palliative field. There 
are similar limitations on applications of curative field as discussed for SABR dose. Therefore, curative field would be applied 
to selected patients, who can be treated with SABR dose of BED 
≥ 80 Gy10 for entire visible lesion. If this approach is impossible, 
palliative field would be applied with at least SABR dose of 80 
Gy10 and should consider additional treatments, including TACE 
or sorafenib. A multidisciplinary approach would overcome the 
limitation of an application of SABR for BCLC-C stage and have 
better survival. 
In our study, 8 patients (23%) experienced toxicity of CTCAE 
grade ≥ 3. Among these, 5 (14%) required prompt therapeutic 
intervention. Severe gastrointestinal toxicity of grade 3-5 developed in 3 patients. Because there are no definite constraints regarding gastrointestinal tract for SABR, we restricted the dosages 
to stomach, duodenum, and colon to the lowest levels as possible until last year. Recently, we published the analysis for predictor of severe gastroduodenal toxicity after SABR with 3 fractions from our experience (25). The maximum point dose of 
35 Gy and 38 Gy in the gastroduodenum were respectively associated with a 5% and 10% probability of developing severe 
gastroduodenal toxicity. This severe gastroduodenal toxicity 
would be reduced, applying this dose constraint strictly. One 
patient experienced myelitis of grade 4. Last year, we had published the corresponding case report (26). After experience of 
this severe toxicity, we have maintained faithfully constraints of 
spinal cord. One patient had grade 3 hepatic failure. He received 
SABR for the right hepatic vein and inferior vena cava tumor 
thrombosis. Although the normal liver volume received < 17 
Gy was 1,460 mL, hepatic encephalopathy of grade 3 developed 
1 month later. He had unchanged liver function after SABR, 
while reporting a history of constipation 2 days before onset of 
hepatic encephalopathy, which rapidly subsided by lactulose 
enema the following day. We think his hepatic encephalopathy 
may have been due to constipation-induced excessive nitrogen 
load and not due to SABR related toxicity. 
There were some limitations in current study. First, this study 
was a single-institutional retrospective analysis. Therefore patients with a better prognosis among BCLC-C patients might be 
selected previously to receive SABR. Second, this study had a 
small sample size. Because of the limited number of patients, 
we could not form a definite conclusion. To confirm the efficacy 
of SABR in BCLC-C stage HCC, further prospective trials should 
be needed.
In conclusion, SABR for BCLC-C stage HCC showed 1- and 
3-yr OS rates of 52% and 21%, respectively. SABR would be con-

sidered a treatment option for BCLC-C stage, especially in Asian 
countries. However, treatment related toxicity requiring prompt 
therapeutic intervention was moderate. We suggest that CP class 
A is the best candidate for SABR in patients with BCLC-C stage. 
In addition, SABR dose of at least 80 Gy10 would be required to 
achieve a considerable treatment outcome. If the entire visible 
lesion dose not included in SABR target, we suggest a multidisciplinary approach of palliative field with BED ≥ 80 Gy10 and 
additional treatments, including TACE or sorafenib.
