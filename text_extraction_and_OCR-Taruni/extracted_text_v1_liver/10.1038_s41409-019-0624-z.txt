Abstract
Information on incidence, and factors associated with mortality is a prerequisite to improve outcome after hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Therefore, 55′668 deaths in 114′491 patients with HSCT (83.7% allogeneic) for leukemia
were investigated in a landmark analysis for causes of death at day 30 (very early), day 100 (early), at 1 year (intermediate)
and at 5 years (late). Mortality from all causes decreased from cohort 1 (1980–2001) to cohort 2 (2002–2015) in all posttransplant phases after autologous HSCT. After allogeneic HSCT, mortality from infections, GVHD, and toxicity decreased
up to 1 year, increased at 5 years; deaths from relapse increased in all post-transplant phases. Infections of unknown origin
were the main cause of infectious deaths. Lethal bacterial and fungal infections decreased from cohort 1 to cohort 2, not
unknown or mixed infections. Infectious deaths were associated with patient-, disease-, donor type, stem cell source, center,
and country- related factors. Their impact varied over the post-transplant phases. Transplant centres have successfully
managed to reduce death after HSCT in the early and intermediate post-transplant phases, and have identified risk factors.
Late post-transplant care could be improved by focus on groups at risk and better identification of infections of “unknown
origin”.
Introduction
Besides the risk of relapse, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains associated with significant early
and late treatment related mortality (TRM). Infections,
toxicity, and (after allogeneic HSCT only), graft-vs.-host
disease (GVHD) are the main causes of death. An earlier
EBMT (European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation) analysis of patients with good risk leukemia
transplanted between 1980–2001 had shown a significant
increase in the 5-year survival rate from the 1980ies to the
1990ies, primarily due to a marked reduction of infectious
deaths [1]. Since then, HSCT has become established as a
valuable treatment option. The number of transplants has
substantially increased [2–4], indications for HSCT have
broadened [5], and new technologies have been introduced
[4, 6–8]. It is estimated today that more than 1.4 million
transplants have been performed so far worldwide; about
70′000 patients are now being treated annually with HSCT,
half of them in Europe [3].
The improvement in outcome in the 1990ies has been
confirmed by a single centre study for the years 1993–2007
in the United States. It showed a reduction of deaths from
organ damage, infections, and severe acute GVHD [2]. No
in depth large analysis has been conducted since. New
antibiotics, new antifungal and antiviral agents have been
introduced [9–14]. The large expansion of unrelated donor
registries and the use of haploidentical transplants have
given access to donors for many more patients [4]. The
introduction of reduced-intensity conditioning transplants

made HSCT accessible for elderly and frail patients [6].
Still, it remains unknown whether deaths from infections
continued to decline since 2001. Furthermore, factors
associated with death from infections, a prerequisite for
further improvement, are largely unknown. We therefore
designed the study to analyse the causes of deaths after
HSCT over calendar year time, at specified post-transplant
time phases, and searched for factors associated with it. We
hypothesized that the key factors differ depending on the
time phase after HSCT, both after allogeneic and
autologous HSCT.
Patients and methods
Study design
This retrospective, observational study included all patients
with HSCT from all donor types and stem cell sources for
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) between
1980 and 2015, reported by 588 centers from 51 countries
to the EBMT database. This patient selection and the two
time periods (cohort 1 from 1980–2001and cohort 2 from
2002–2015) were based on a previous study, but did include
now all disease stages, not only first CR patients [1]. There
were no exclusion criteria. All data collection was performed by the IDWP Data Office (Leiden) according to
EBMT guidelines (http://www.ebmt.org/retrospectivestudies).
The analysis followed a stepwise approach. First, the
data cohort was set up: all transplants in the EBMT data file
from 1980 to 2015 were retrieved and assessed for completeness as specified below. In the second step, this file
with complete information was closed as of January 1st
2017, and recoded for the specific new grouping of donor
type and centre and country specific economic parameters.
Data were verified, and the descriptive analysis was
performed.
All EBMT teams are required to obtain patients’ consent
for data transfer to EBMT and to have internal review board
approval for their transplant programs. The data set was
locked and anonymized. No centers were contacted for
missing information. No additional ethics approval was
mandated.
Study population
The study comprised a total number of 114′491 patients
with HSCT, 95′789 (84%) allogeneic and 18′702 (16%)
autologous, for AML (57.2%), ALL (25.4%), or CML
(17.4%); of these 42′997 (37.6%) were in cohort 1, and 71′
494(62.4%) in cohort 2. There were 56.5% male, 43.5%
female patients with a median age of 37 years (0–84 years
range) (Table 1).
Working definitions
Death after transplant was categorized as previously defined
[1, 15] into death from relapse (RM, relapse mortality: any
death after relapse) and death from causes other than relapse
(GVHD, toxicity, infection, other and unknown causes).
Infectious deaths were analysed as total, and split by bacterial, fungal, viral, parasitic, mixed, and unknown
infections.
Disease stage was defined as early disease (CR1 in ALL
and AML; first CP in CML) or late disease (all other: ≥CR2,
progression, refractory/relapsed).
Donor type was analysed in 10 types as previously
described: autologous, syngeneic, HLA-identical sibling
donor HY-
, HLA-identical sibling donor HY+, matched
family donor HY-
, matched family donor HY+, matched
unrelated donor HY-
, matched unrelated donor HY+, mismatched unrelated donor, mismatched family donor (HY+
refers to a female donor for a male recipient; HY- to all
other donor-recipient sex combinations) [16]. Matching was
used as classified by the reporting team, at the time of first
report.
Acute GVHD was graded according to previously published criteria [17]. Chronic GVHD was graded as limited
or extensive.
Centre specific microeconomic and country specific
macroeconomic factors were integrated as previously
described [18]. Centre size was defined for each transplant
by the number of transplants performed in the centre for the
main disease of the patient in the year of the transplant (0–4,
5–19, 20+ transplants). Centre experience in years was
defined by the number of years that the centre had performed transplants until the year of the transplant of the
patient (0–4, 5–19, 20+ years of program). Country macroeconomic status was defined by gross national income
(GNI/capita) in 2016: high income, upper middle income,
lower middle income (source: www.worldbank.org). Geographical regions were defined as: north-western eastern
and southern (see Table 3A and Table 3B for details).
JACIE accreditation status (accredited, expired, withdrawn
and not accredited) in 2016 was used.
Statistical analysis
The primary endpoint was to compute the cumulative
incidence (CumInc) of overall post-transplant mortality in
cohorts 1 and 2. The CumInc of death was reported at
specified time phases after the transplant (very early: day
+30, early: day +100, intermediate: +1 year and late: +5
years) in a landmark approach. Analysis at day +30

included all patients, the analyses at day +100, year +1,
year +5 included patients alive at day +30, day +100,
year +1, respectively.
Secondary endpoints were, as in the previous report [1],
the CumInc of mortality due to relapse, GVHD, infection,
other and unknown causes. GVHD was used as “any
GVHD ever”, not separated by acute or chronic GVHD.
The cumulative incidence estimator was applied, with the
Gray test being used to compare different groups. Differences in CumInc rates without overlapping of the 95%CI’s
were considered as significant.
The cause-specific Cox model was used to detect the
factors related to the infection death for the four posttransplant phases. The death due to infection was considered as event of interest and death due to other causes as
competing event.
Factors integrated into the analysis were sex and age of
the patients, main diagnosis (ALL or AML or CML), stage
of the disease, donor/recipient sex matching (HY- vs HY+),
type of donor (HLA-matched sibling vs other donor types),
type of conditioning (RIC vs MAC), source of stem cells
(PB vs BM vs CB), year and number of transplantation and
presence or absence of in vivo and ex vivo T-cell depletion,
and macro- and microeconomic center data as explained
above. Factors with a p-value < 0.2 from the univariate
analysis were included in the multivariate analysis. Factors
with a p value of <0.05 were considered as significant.
Comparisons for categorical variables were done using
the Fisher’s exact test or the χ2 test. The proportional hazard
assumption was verified using graphical methods: scaled
Schoenfeld [19] residuals and graphical checks proposed by
Klein-Moeschberger [20] were performed without finding
evidence of relevant violations. All the analyses were performed using the statistical software SAS (SAS Institute
Inc., Cary, NC, USA) version 9.4.
Results
Patient population and demographic changes over
calendar time
There were significant differences in absolute numbers, in
patients, disease and donor characteristics, as well as in
transplant procedure techniques between the two cohorts.
Median age increased from 33.1 years to 41.0 years. The
proportion and the absolute numbers of patients with AML
and ALL increased, the ones of CML decreased. There were
more allogeneic HSCT in the second cohort, more transplants with reduced intensity conditioning and more transplants with peripheral blood as stem cell source. Economic
factors showed changes, with more transplants in the second
cohort from eastern and lower income countries and within
non accredited centres; there was an increase in transplants
in more experienced centres by patient volume and years of
transplants (Table 1).
Main causes of death and changes over posttransplant phase and calendar time
A total of the 55′668 patients were reported as having died,
52′448 thereof during the observation period (45.8% of all
patients; 43′930 after allogeneic, 8′518 after autologous
HSCT): 22′518 (42.9%) died from relapse, 8′361 (15.9%)
from GvHD, 11′701 (22.3%) from infections, 8028 (15.3%)
from other, and 1540 (2.9%) from unknown causes
(Table 2A and Table 2B). There were major differences
between allogeneic (Table 2A, S5) and autologous
(Table 2B, S6) HSCT, regarding main causes of death,
changes over post-transplant phases and changes over
calendar year time (Figs. 1–3, Fig. S1A). Main cause of death
was relapse after both, allogeneic (38.7%) and autologous
(64.5%), followed by infections (23.8% allogeneic; 14.8%
autologous), and GvHD (19.0% allogeneic only). After
allogeneic HSCT, 15′418 (35.1%) of all deaths occurred
during the first 100 days, 10′174 (23.0%) between 1 and 5
years after the transplant, in contrast to autologous HSCT
with 1587 (18.6%) of deaths within the first 100 days and
2925 (34.3%) of deaths between 1 and 5 year post-transplant.
The changes in mortality from cohort 1 to cohort 2 differed between allogeneic and autologous HSCT for the four
post-transplant periods. In the landmark analysis, the
cumulative incidence of overall mortality decreased from
cohort 1 to cohort 2 at +30d (p < 0.001), at +100d (p <
0.001), and at +1y (p < 0.001), but increased at +5y (p <
0.01) (Fig. 1, Table 2A and Table 2B, Table S1A). After
autologous HSCT, the cumulative incidence for overall
mortality decreased in each of the four post-transplant
phases for each cause of death, including relapse except for
“other” causes of death in very late phase (Table 2A and
Table 2B, S1B). After allogeneic HSCT, mortality from
GVHD, and other causes decreased in the very early, early,
and intermediate phases, but increased in the late phase for
GVHD and for other causes (Fig. 2, Table 2A and Table 2B,
S1C). Mortality from relapse increased in all post-transplant
phases. As a result, overall mortality decreased in the very
early (+d30; p < 0.0001) and early phase (+d100; p <
0.0001), but increased in the late phase (+5y: p < 0.0001)
(Table 2A and Table 2B, S1C).
Causes of infectious death and changes over posttransplant phase and calendar year time
A total of 11′941 patients died of infectious complications.
The majority of lethal infections (59.4%) were of unknown
etiology, 14.7% were of bacterial, 10.6% of fungal, 9.2% of

viral, 1% of parasitic, and 5.2% of mixed origin (Fig. 3,
Fig. S1B). Mortality from mixed/unknown infections
increased from cohort 1 to cohort 2 in the very early phase
(+30d: 1.35; 95%CI 1.25–1.47 vs 1.54; 95%CI 1.45–1.63).
Mortality from bacterial, viral, fungal and parasitic infections decreased in very early, early, and intermediate phases
(Fig. 3, Fig. S1B). In the late phase, mortality from bacterial
and fungal infections decreased, while mortality from viral,
mixed or unknown infectious etiology did not change
(Table S1A). The pattern of infectious deaths, including
bacterial, viral, fungal and parasitic infections was similar
for allo- and auto-HSCT, but with a distinct and constantly
lower CumInc for all types of infections at all phases after
HSCT for auto-HSCT (Tables S1BC, Tables S2-S6).
Factors associated with death from infections
Factors associated with death from infection after HSCT
related to patient, disease, donor-type, stem cell source, year
of transplant and center specific macro- or micro-economic
properties. Their impact varied significantly depending on
main donor type (autologous vs. allogeneic) and the phase
after transplant (Table 3A and Table 3B, Fig. S2AB).

type, and second or later transplant were associated with
increased risk of infectious death in all phases and for all
donor types. Patient sex showed no associations at all.
Peripheral blood as stem cell source was associated with
less infectious deaths in all post-transplant phases after autologous HSCT; it was associated with more infectious deaths
after allogeneic HSCT in the late phase, reflecting the higher
probability of chronic GvHD with peripheral blood. This
same association with GvHD in the late phase is reflected by
the higher rate of deaths from infections in the HY+ donor
recipient combinations (Table 3A and Table 3B, Fig. S2AB).
Of note, country specific macro-economic factors, GNI/
capita and geographic region, were associated only during
the very early and early post-transplant phase; the same
applied to centre specific micro-economic factors. Centres
with more than 20 years of disease specific transplant
experience had significantly less infectious death in the
early and intermediate post-transplant phases. No significant
association could be documented between death from
infections and JACIE accreditation status, in contrast to the
association with overall mortality.
Discussion
The results of this comprehensive study are clear: the European transplant teams have successfully managed to
reduce all-cause mortality after autologous HSCT at all
post-transplant time phases. In allogeneic HSCT, they were
successful in reducing deaths from GVHD, infections and
other causes in the very early and early post-transplant time
phases, despite an increase in the patient pre-transplant risk
profile. In contrast, data did not show a reduction of death
from relapse after allogeneic HSCT, and no reduced mortality in the late post-transplant phase. The latter observation
is of concern, but indicates areas for improvements.
The analysis confirmed well established disease, patient,
donor, transplant and center-related risk factors for death
from all causes and from infection after transplant [1, 2, 21].
Novel is the observation that not all factors are equally
relevant during all post-transplant time phases. Advanced
disease stage at time of transplant remains associated with
increased risk of mortality from all causes throughout the
whole post-transplant phase, and so is increasing age of the
recipient, with the exception of the very early phase where
other factors dominate. During all post-transplant phases,
allogenicity dominates. Of note, the HY+ effect adds bearing
on mortality primarily after day 100; the early beneficial
effect of peripheral blood stem cells reverts to a detrimental
effect beyond 1 year. As observed earlier, accreditation status
of the center is associated with mortality of the patients and
with overall improvement over calendar year time [22].
The same risk factors were associated with death from
infections. Late disease stage was in all post-transplant
phases associated with more infectious deaths. Increasing
age contributed to risk of death from infection in a hierarchical effect by decade. Of interest, despite an increase in
age in cohort 2, deaths from infections were still reduced,
reflecting the possible benefit of better management of
infectious complications, through novel diagnostic methods,
drugs and guidelines [9–11, 23–25]. Cord blood as a stem
cell source was associated with a higher rate of infectious
deaths in the first three post-transplant phases, but no longer
after 1 year. Peripheral blood as a stem cell source was
associated with a lower rate of deaths in the first three
phases, not in the last. These results might have been
influenced by an additional, indirect late GVHD effect of
peripheral blood stem cells. This is supported by the
increased risk of infectious deaths in HY+ donor recipient
combinations. Of note, disease specific center experience in
years was strongly associated with reduced infectious
deaths in the early post-transplant phase [22].

There are major caveats in this study. It looks at very
heterogeneous data over a long time period with many
changes in disease indications, choice of donor type, stem
cell source. over calendar year time. Data were derived from
a multitude of centers from many countries with different
micro- and macroeconomic backgrounds. Some data, such
as cytogenetic profiles were not in the data set. Some
decisions had to be arbitrary, such as the use of economic
factors as of the year 2016. Centers had varying attitudes
regarding data collection, and potentially different interpretations of “cause of death”. Simply, we used the data as
they were reported to the database, and we accepted the
information as given by the center, including the high rate
of deaths and infectious deaths of “unknown” origin. Still,
the consistency of the findings in the four post-transplant
phases, and the confirmation of key risk factor elements are
strong arguments that the data are valid. They were as well
in line with our pre-set hypotheses, that factors associated
with overall mortality and from infections would differ
depending on the post-transplant phase. This was the case,
but is of concern. Mortality was reduced early post-transplant, but increased in the late phase after allogeneic HSCT.
Hence, improvements were more rapidly visible than deteriorations; the increase in late mortality years after the
transplant might not be recognized to the same extent, with
patients frequently at distance from the center. Lethal

Centre size was defined for each transplant by the number of transplants performed in the center for the main disease of the patient in the year of
the transplant (0–4, 5–19, 20 + transplants). Centre experience in years was defined by the number of years that the center had performed
transplants until the year of the transplant of the patient (0–4, 5–19, 20 + years of program). Country macroeconomic status was defined by gross
national income (GNI/capita) in 2016 (high income, upper middle income, lower middle income) (source: www.worldbank.org). Geographical
regions were defined as: north-western (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden,
Switzerland, UK), eastern (Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Lithuania, Macedonia, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia) and southern
(Cyprus, Greece, Israel, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, and other EBMT countries). JACIE accreditation status (accredited, expired, withdrawn and
not accredited) in 2016 was used. HR > 2.0 is highlighted in orange; HR > 1.5 is highlighted in yellow.
Death after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: changes over calendar year time, infections and. . . 133

infections caused by bacteria and fungi were reduced at any
time point, but not infections of unknown origin.
This high rate of “unknown “ infections is intriguing and
of prime concern. The constant pattern in all reporting centers, over calendar year time and over all post-transplant
phases indicates that it might be a real entity, but without the
same awareness as any specified infection. There is no
information in the data set, whether the appropriate tests were
not done, were not successful, or whether organ-related
infections, such as pneumonia with negative microbiological
work up were simply classified as such [15]. It will be
essential for the future to learn whether “unknown” includes
hitherto unknown infectious agents, or might be a set of
multiple immune response syndromes. The focus on specified
risk groups will support such strategies. Late infectious
mortality as an entity remains of concern. It presents a
complicated issue, probably resulting from the negative
effects of many variables such as GVHD, inadequate immune
recovery, poor graft function, increasing co-morbidities with
increasing age. It might reflect as well the variable expertise
of health care providers in the different transplant centers for
the long-term follow-up of their patients.
What are the consequences of this report? The positive
message is that outcomes were and can be improved. With
similar efforts in late post-transplant care, it will be possible
to improve outcome beyond 1 year as well. The first step is to
become aware of the reality, to shift efforts, and to focus on
preventable and reversible late complications. Strategies will
need to include efforts for better identification of causes and
treatment of mixed and “unknown” infections through collaborative efforts. Older patients, those with a second or later
transplant and those with mismatched allogeneic transplants
remain at higher risk, even years after transplant. They might
require targeted follow-up programs. Prospective studies
assessing causes of death 5 years or more after HSCT could
help to characterize and possibly to target efforts to prevent
late mortality. Finally, the major role of “allogeneicity” in
death after allogeneic compared to autologous HSCT might
lead to reconsider more carefully risk adapted indications for
allogeneic HSCT.
Public health bodies and transplant teams need to
recognize that fatal events can occur many months or years
after the transplant procedure. Early detection and rapid
treatment, particularly of infections, requires allocation of
resources. Support includes data collection and data analysis which are integral parts of any transplant therapy [26].
Recent FACT-JACIE standards have incorporated longterm follow-up strategies between specialist transplant
centers and local health-care services. Given the long time
horizons, this will require support in planning and resources

by public health bodies [27–29]. Furthermore, in the era of
precision medicine and targeted therapies, HSCT has to
provide best outcome regarding overall survival, quality of
life and costs compared to any other treatment strategy [16].
Careful and continuing analysis of large data sets will help
to achieve this goal.
