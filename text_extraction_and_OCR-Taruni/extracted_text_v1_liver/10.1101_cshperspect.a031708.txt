Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is transmitted by the fecal–oral route and is a major cause of acute viral
hepatitis. The clinical manifestations of HAV infection range from asymptomatic infection to
acute liver failure (ALF), but do not include progression to chronic hepatitis. Risk factors for
severe acute hepatitis A are older age (>40 years) and preexisting liver disease. Some patients
may show atypical clinical features such as relapsing hepatitis, prolonged cholestasis, or
extrahepatic manifestations. Almost all hepatitis A patients spontaneously recover with supportive care. However, in the case of ALF (<1%), intensive care and urgent decision on liver
transplantation are required. Liver injury during hepatitis A is not directly caused by HAV but
is known to be caused by immune-mediated mechanisms. In this review, the natural history
and clinical manifestations of hepatitis A are described. In addition, mechanisms of immunopathogenesis in hepatitis A are discussed.
Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is transmitted by the
fecal–oral route and is a major cause of
acute viral hepatitis, which can lead to acute liver
failure (ALF) and mortality in severe cases. The
number of global hepatitis A cases was ∼1.4
million with 27,731 deaths in 2010 (Havelaar
et al. 2015). HAV infection often causes symptomatic hepatitis in adults, whereas it tends to
result in an asymptomatic subclinical infection
in children. Following socioeconomic development and public health improvement, the global
incidence of HAV infection has been decreasing.
However, an increasing number of individuals
are infected at older ages, leading to more severe
clinical manifestations and greater disease burden (Murphy et al. 2016). The clinical manifestations of HAV infection range from asymptomatic infection to ALF, and some patients show
atypical features such as relapsing hepatitis or
prolonged cholestatic hepatitis, as well as extrahepatic manifestations. In this review, we consider pitfalls in the diagnosis of hepatitis A, therapeutic considerations including predictors for
urgent liver transplantation, and mechanisms of
pathogenesis.

gents. HAV inactivation requires heating foods
(>85°C) for 1 min or disinfecting surfaces with a
1:100 dilution of sodium hypochlorite (household bleach) for 1 min (Nainan et al. 2006). After ingestion of HAV through the fecal–oral
route, HAV survives the acidic stomach environment and is ultimately delivered to the liver.
Whether it first replicates at a primary site within the gastrointestinal tract is uncertain. HAV
replicates in hepatocytes and is then secreted
into bile and thus back into the gastrointestinal
tract. It is finally excreted via feces or transferred
to the liver through an enterohepatic cycle until
virus neutralization (Cuthbert 2001).
Following an incubation period of 15–50
days (mean, 30 days) after HAV infection, patients develop symptoms of acute hepatitis with
elevated levels of serum aspartate/alanine aminotransferases (AST/ALTs) (Fig. 1). Before
symptoms, there are waves of viremia and copious amounts of fecal viral shedding. Feces are
the primary source of HAV transmission because of their high viral load. In comparison,
serum HAV concentrations are two or three
log10 units lower than in the feces (Martin and
Lemon 2006). Therefore, risk of transmission is
highest during the prodromal phase before
symptoms or biochemical manifestations. The
virus is also shed in the saliva at even lower
concentrations (Amado Leon et al. 2015). Concordant with clinical hepatitis, anti-HAV immunoglobulin M (Ig)M and subsequently antiHAV IgG appear in the serum and saliva, accompanied by a marked reduction of fecal virus
shedding and viremia (Fig. 1). Although antiHAV IgM is detectable for up to 6 months, antiHAV IgG persists, conferring lifelong immunity
(Normann et al. 2004).
CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS OF
HEPATITIS A
Clinical Signs and Symptoms of Acute
Hepatitis A
The clinical manifestations of HAV infection
range from asymptomatic infection to ALF,
but it does not progress to chronic hepatitis.
Development of symptomatic hepatitis is associated with patient age. Relatively few children
under 6 years of age (<30%) manifest hepatitis
symptoms, whereas the majority of adults
(>70%) develop symptoms that persist for 2–8
weeks (Fig. 2) (Armstrong and Bell 2002). The
onset of hepatitis A is often abrupt with fever
(18%–75%), malaise (52%–91%), nausea or
vomiting (26%–87%), abdominal discomfort
(37%–65%), and then dark urine (28%–94%)
and jaundice. Less commonly, pruritus, diarrhea, arthralgia, or skin rash develop. When

the patient seeks medical advice, the fever has
usually disappeared. On physical examination,
hepatomegaly (78%) and jaundice (40%–80%)
are frequently detected (Koff 1992; Khan et al.
2012).
Laboratory Findings and Diagnosis
Laboratory results show elevated levels of total
bilirubin (mean peak level of 7–13 mg/dL), alkaline phosphatase (mean peak level of 319–
335 IU/L), and ALT (mean peak level of 1952-
3628 IU/L). Sometimes, very high levels of ALT
(∼10,000 IU/L) are observed, but this is not a
poor prognostic indicator (Tong et al. 1995; Jung
et al. 2010b). Prolonged prothrombin time ([PT]
<40%) and high bilirubin levels in the absence of
hemolysis indicate severe hepatitis with a potential risk for ALF. Radiological findings of hepatitis A include hepatomegaly, gallbladder wall
thickening more than 3 mm (80%) with arterial
heterogeneity, periportal tracking, and perihepatic lymph node enlargement (>7 mm in diameter) (Fig. 3) (Park et al. 2013). Gallbladder
wall thickening is associated with high bilirubin
levels and may be an independent factor of severe hepatitis, which is defined as PT ≤ 40% or
bilirubin ≥10 mg/dL (Suk et al. 2009).
Because symptoms or biochemical laboratory findings are nonspecific for HAV infection,
serological confirmation is essential for diagnosis. Detection of serum anti-HAV IgM via commercially available assays is the primary diagnostic method in clinical settings. However,
6%–11% of symptomatic patients do not show
a detectable anti-HAV IgM at clinical onset, especially during the early symptomatic phase
(Jung et al. 2010b; Lee et al. 2013). Therefore,
repeated examination of anti-HAV IgM 2 to 5
days after the first examination should be performed if there is clinical suspicion. Seroconversion to anti-HAV IgM positivity on the second
examination leads to the correct hepatitis A diagnosis. Rarely (8%–20%), anti-HAV IgM can
be transiently detected in persons who have recently received an HAV vaccine (Nainan et al.
2006). Previous HAV infection is diagnosed by a
positive serum anti-HAV test in the absence of
IgM anti-HAV. Although saliva anti-HAV IgM
testing can be used as a screening test in the
setting of outbreak investigations, its sensitivity
is lower than serum testing (Amado Leon et al.
2015).
Complications of Acute Hepatitis A
HAV infection is self-limited and does not progress to chronic hepatitis. However, 10%–20% of
patients develop relapsing hepatitis or prolonged cholestasis lasting for more than 6

Figure 2. The clinical outcomes of hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection. Clinical manifestations of HAV infection
depend on the age of patients. Most adult patients develop symptomatic hepatitis, whereas most young children
do not. Common hepatitis symptoms are fever, malaise, nausea or vomiting, abdominal discomfort, and dark
urine and jaundice. Reported extrahepatic complications include acute kidney injury, acalculous cholecystitis,
pancreatitis, pleural or pericardial effusion, hemolysis, hemophagocytosis, pure red-cell aplasia, acute reactive
arthritis, skin rash, and neurological manifestations such as mononeuritis, Guillain–Barré syndrome, and transverse myelitis.

months (Fig. 2). Relapsing hepatitis develops in
up to 12% of patients after initial hepatitis resolution but is mostly a milder form of hepatitis
compared with the initial one. Viremia and fecal
viral shedding reappear with relapsing hepatitis
(Glikson et al. 1992). A study using a chimpanzee model suggested that relapsing hepatitis
might be associated with rapid contraction of
or failure to maintain virus-specific CD4+ Tcell responses (Zhou et al. 2012).
Prolonged cholestasis (total bilirubin level
>5 mg/dL lasting for >4 weeks) is observed in
5%–7% of patients and presents with pruritus
and fatigue. It is related to preexisting chronic
hepatitis B, prolonged PT, and high total bilirubin at initial examination (Jung et al. 2010b).
Although these patients show severe cholestasis
with total bilirubin levels of up to 40 mg/dL,
patients are generally in good condition with
nearly normal levels of AST/ALT and PT and
finally recover.
Acute Liver Failure in the Setting
of HAV Infection
Hepatitis A severity is related to age at infection
and preexisting liver diseases. ALF, which develops in 0.015%–0.5% of hepatitis A patients, has

the highest rates in older adults (>40–50 years of
age) and patients with underlying chronic liver
diseases with limited hepatic functional reserve
(Chen et al. 2016; Murphy et al. 2016). In a
prospective, multicenter study in South Korea
of 595 adult hepatitis A cases (mean age of 31
years), 99.5% of patients spontaneously recovered, 0.5% developed ALF, and 0.2% experienced ALF-related mortality (Jung et al.
2010b). The 1988 Shanghai hepatitis A epidemic, which affected >300,000 people mostly in
their 20s to 40s, showed a similar case fatality
rate (0.015%). In that study, the case fatality rate
of hepatitis A with underlying chronic hepatitis
B (0.05%) was 5.6 times higher than in those
without hepatitis B virus infection (0.009%)
(Keeffe 1995; Cooksley 2000).
The effect of HAV viral load on the ALF risk
is controversial. One study reported that lower
serum HAV viral load was associated with a
higher risk of ALF (Rezende et al. 2003). However, more recent studies have shown that a higher viral load is related to ALF (Lee et al. 2015).
Variable blood sampling times and the fluctuating nature of viremia during the acute phase may
be related to this discrepancy. Likewise, although
nucleotide sequence variation in the 50 nontranslated segment of the HAV genome has been associated with severe acute hepatitis A, this has
not been confirmed (Fujiwara et al. 2002; Kanda
et al. 2010; Ajmera et al. 2011). A human genetic
polymorphism, 157insMTTTVP, in the gene encoding T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-1 (TIM1)/HAVCR1 was associated with
ALF in Argentinean patients (Kim et al. 2011).
TIM1 is a phosphatidylserine receptor that facilitates cellular entry of many enveloped viruses.
Recent studies show that it does not play an
essential role in HAV entry, but TIM1 does enhance uptake of quasi-enveloped “eHAV” virions (Das et al. 2017).
HAV-related ALF outcomes from a U.S.
study (n = 29) and a South Korean study (n =
35) similarly showed that 55%–57% of patients
spontaneously recovered, 31–38% underwent
liver transplantation, and 6%–14% died without
transplantation (Fig. 2). A prognostic model incorporating serum ALT <2600 IU/L, creatinine
>2.0 mg/dL, intubation, and pressor use was
proposed for predicting transplantation or
death (Taylor et al. 2006). An independent factor for spontaneous survival was degree of hepatic encephalopathy in the Korean study (Kim
et al. 2008).
Extrahepatic Manifestations
Reported extrahepatic manifestations include
acute kidney injury, acalculous cholecystitis,
pancreatitis, pleural or pericardial effusion, hemolysis, hemophagocytosis, pure red-cell aplasia, acute reactive arthritis, skin rash, and neurological manifestations such as mononeuritis,
Guillain–Barré syndrome, and transverse myelitis (Jeong and Lee 2010). Acute kidney injury
(AKI), defined by serum creatinine level >2.0
mg/dL or at least a 1.5-fold increase from baseline serum creatinine level, develops in 1.5%–
7.6% of hepatitis A patients (Jung et al. 2010b;
Choi et al. 2011). Prerenal azotemia, interstitial
nephritis, and acute tubular necrosis predominantly contribute to AKI in hepatitis A along
with intravascular hemolysis, direct hepatotoxicity of hyperbilirubinemia, or immune complex-associated glomerulopathy. It is associated
with older age (>40 years), male sex, diabetes,
high alcohol intake, leukocytosis, elevated C reactive protein (CRP) level, higher bilirubin level,
higher AST/ALT level, or low albumin level. In
nonfulminant hepatitis A, 10%–50% of AKI
cases require renal replacement therapy (Jung
et al. 2010a). Rare cases of autoimmune hepatitis
following hepatitis A have been reported. However, prior HAV infection has been associated
with a lower probability of having hay fever and
asthma (Matricardi et al. 2002).
Hepatitis A during pregnancy is generally
benign. However, preterm uterine contraction
is commonly associated with HAV infection, especially during the second and third trimester.
This may be associated with proinflammatory
cytokines or hyperbilirubinemia. In Israel, 13
pregnant cases showed a high rate (9/13, 69%)
of gestational complications such as premature
contraction, placental separation, premature
rupture of membranes, and vaginal bleeding
(Elinav et al. 2006). In 12 South Korean pregnancy cases, there were two preterm labors, one

premature rupture of membranes, and one fetal
ascites and intraabdominal calcification, which
spontaneously resolved (Cho et al. 2013). Fetal
meconium peritonitis may be related to intrauterine HAV infection, which in two reported
cases led to neonatal small bowel perforation
(Leikin et al. 1996; McDuffie and Bader 1999).
However, fetal outcome is generally benign and
mother-to-child transmission is very rare. Although HAV RNA may be detected in breast
milk, breastfeeding is not contraindicated.
Management
There is no specific antiviral therapy for hepatitis A. Supportive care such as adequate hydration and symptomatic control of fever or vomiting with antipyretics or antiemetics is generally
performed. Extrahepatic complications must
be monitored, and renal function support via
hemodialysis may be required. In the case of
prolonged cholestasis, a few studies have reported response to corticosteroid therapy. However, corticosteroid treatment should be used
with caution, considering the prolonged presence of HAV RNA (up to 12 months) in the liver
(Lanford et al. 2011) and potentially harmful
effects of corticosteroids on the immune control
of HAV. Administration of ursodeoxycholic
acid or cholestyramine may be considered for
pruritus control (Jeong and Lee 2010). Furthermore, hepatitis A-associated ALF may rapidly
progress within a week. Thus, intensive,
multidisciplinary care and recognition of poor
prognostic factors are needed to facilitate urgent
decision-making situations regarding liver
transplantation.
PATHOGENESIS
Viral Replication in the Host
According to a recent study, a quasi-enveloped
form of HAV (eHAV) is detected in the serum
and plasma of infected hosts, whereas a nonenveloped, naked form of HAV is shed through
feces (Fig. 4) (Feng et al. 2013). eHAV is released
from hepatocytes and subsequently loses its lipid envelope following exposure to high concentrations of bile salts in the biliary canaliculus
(Walker et al. 2015; Hirai-Yuki et al. 2016b).
HAV can take advantage of the specific characteristics of eHAV and nonenveloped HAV for
immune evasion and efficient viral transmission, respectively. Within infected hosts, the
quasi-envelope of eHAV cloaks the capsid, sequestering it from neutralizing antibodies that
target capsid proteins (Feng et al. 2013). Nonenveloped, naked HAV is very stable and is shed
in feces via the intestinal tract while preserving
its infectivity. Moreover, in the environment,
nonenveloped, naked HAV is highly transmissible to other hosts because of its high physicochemical stability (Walker et al. 2015).
During acute hepatitis A, peaks of fecal
shedding of the virus and viremia are followed
by hepatocellular injury, which is manifested by
elevation of liver enzymes in the serum such as
ALT (Fig. 1) (Shin et al. 2016a). After the first
increase in serum ALT levels, viral shedding in
feces usually continues for ∼2 to 3 weeks, although sensitive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction methods may detect it for
longer periods (Martin and Lemon 2006). Clinical relapse with fecal viral shedding can occur
following the resolution of hepatitis A (Sjogren
et al. 1987), and prolonged viremia has also been
reported in some adult patients with hepatitis A
(Normann et al. 2004). A chimpanzee study reported the persistence of hepatitis C virus
(HCV) RNA in the liver for months after cessation of fecal virus excretion (Lanford et al. 2011).
Meanwhile, protracted forms of HAV infection
were strongly associated with a specific HLA-DR
allele, HLA-DRB11301 (Fainboim et al. 2001).
Extrahepatic sites of HAV replication have
been suggested. In fact, HAV antigens can be
detected in not only hepatocytes but also in
the spleen, lymph nodes, and kidneys of infected
nonhuman primates (Mathiesen et al. 1978).
HAV antigens have also been detected in small
intestine crypt cells in owl monkeys (Aotus trivirgatus) orally inoculated with HAV (Asher et al.
1995); this has not been confirmed in humans.
In addition, HAV has been detected in the
tonsils and saliva shortly after viremia (Cohen
et al. 1989) although the viral titer in saliva is
very low.

Liver Injury
As described above, acute HAV infection often
causes severe liver injury in adults, whereas it
tends to result in a subclinical, asymptomatic
infection in children (Shin et al. 2016a). ALF
develops in extreme cases. In the liver with hepatitis A, hepatocyte degeneration and infiltration
by mononuclear inflammatory cells are observed. Activation of Kupffer cells and disruption of bile canaliculi may also be observed.
The mechanism for liver injury during hepatitis A has not yet been clearly elucidated.
Moreover, the reason why adults tend to experience symptomatic liver injury after HAV infection is poorly understood. However, it is
known that the liver injury is not caused by
direct cytopathic effect of HAV (Siegl and Weitz
1993). This is indirectly supported by the fact
that viral replication and fecal excretion both
peak before serum ALT level elevation. Moreover, HAV-infected cells do not show cytopathic
effects, and their metabolism is not impacted
when infected by HAV in vitro (Gauss-Muller
and Deinhardt 1984), further indicating that
hepatitis A liver injury is not caused by virusinduced cytopathology. Instead, liver injury in
hepatitis A is caused by immune-mediated
mechanisms involving both innate and adaptive
immune responses to the virus (Shin et al.
2016a). Indeed, patient studies indicate possible
roles for T cells, cytokines, and chemokines in
liver injury during hepatitis A, as described
below.

MECHANISMS OF
IMMUNOPATHOGENESIS
T Cells
During hepatitis A, the appearance of T cells in
the liver temporally coincides with an increase
in serum ALT levels (Fig. 1), suggesting an important role for T cells in liver injury (Shin et al.
2016a). At the same time, viral titers in feces and
serum start to decrease. Virus-specific CD8+ T
cells may contribute to both viral control and
liver injury in HAV-infected hosts. Early studies
reported that peripheral blood lymphocytes or
liver-derived CD8+ T-cell clones from hepatitis
A patients exert cytotoxicity against HAV-infected cells (Kurane et al. 1985; Vallbracht et
al. 1986, 1989) and produce IFN-γ (Kurane
et al. 1985; Maier et al. 1988; Fleischer et al.
1990), which can amplify inflammation at the
infection site. Following on these early reports,
other studies suggest a role for HAV-specific
CD8+ T cells in the induction of liver injury in
hepatitis A. A recent study described CD8+ Tcell responses targeting multiple epitopes of
HAV and observed an activated phenotype of
HAV-specific CD8+ T cells in the blood of patients with acute HAV infection (Schulte et al.
2011). On the contrary, a chimpanzee study
showed that HAV-specific CD8+ T cells were
undetectable in the blood during acute HAV infection or were nonfunctional if detected (Zhou
et al. 2012). Instead, HAV-specific CD4+ T cells
were detected and polyfunctional. In summary,
how T cells contribute to liver injury in hepatitis
A has yet to befully elucidated, including antigen
specificity, subsets, activating signals, and effector molecules, all of which need to be further
clarified.
A role for natural killer T (NKT) cells was
suggested in relation to the 157insMTTTVP
polymorphism described above in the gene encoding TIM-1/HAVCR1 (Kim et al. 2011).
TIM1 was previously considered to be an essential cellular receptor for HAV, but is now known
to contribute only to the cellular entry of quasienveloped virions (Das et al. 2017). Severe HAVinduced liver injury was associated with the six
amino acid insertion in TIM-1 (Kim et al. 2011).
Moreover, NKT cells expressing the long form
of TIM-1 exerted stronger cytolytic activity
against HAV-infected cells than those expressing the short form (Kim et al. 2011).
Antibodies and Immune Complexes
Early clinical studies showed immune complex
deposition in the liver and reduced levels of serum complement in hepatitis A patients (Inman
et al. 1986; Margolis et al. 1988). These immune
complexes contained IgM and IgG antibodies,
HAV capsid proteins, and C3 complement
cleavage products (Margolis et al. 1988). However, it is not clear whether immune complexes
and complement activation contribute to liver
inflammation and injury during hepatitis A.
A recent study with peripheral blood from
hepatitis A patients showed that a substantial
number of antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) have
specificities to antigens unrelated to HAV, a bone
marrow plasma cell–like phenotype, and dominantly secrete IgM during acute HAV infection
(Hong et al. 2013). These data suggest that preexisting plasma cells are mobilized and released
into the circulation and contribute to antigennonspecific IgM secretion during acute HAV infection.However, the role of the antigen-nonspecific IgM response in the immunopathogenesis
of HAV infection has not yet been clarified.
Cytokines and Chemokines
Diverse cytokines and chemokines play a role in
immune-mediated host injury by their effector
and immunomodulatory functions. In hepatitis
A patients, serum levels of several cytokines and
chemokines are increased compared with
healthy controls, including interleukin (IL)-6,
IL-8, IL-18, IL-22, CXC-chemokine ligand
(CXCL)9, and CXCL10, although the cells that
produce them have not been identified (Shin
et al. 2016b). In addition, serum levels of granzyme B and soluble Fas ligand, which are molecules involved in T-cell cytotoxicity, are also
increased in hepatitis A patients. Among them,
serum levels of Fas ligand and IL-18 significantly correlate with serum ALT levels and total
bilirubin levels, respectively, in hepatitis A patients (Shin et al. 2016b), suggesting that differE.-C. Shin and S.-H. Jeong

ent immune mechanisms may contribute to hepatocellular injury and cholestatic injury during
hepatitis A. Moreover, serum levels of CXCL9
and CXCL10 significantly correlate with serum
ALT levels (Shin et al. 2016b). CXCL9 and
CXCL10 are chemokines that recruit effector T
cells to peripheral inflammatory sites by binding
to CXCR3, which is typically expressed by effector helper 1 CD4+ T cells and cytotoxic CD8+ T
cells. Amplification of liver injury by antigennonspecific mononuclear cells, which are recruited to the liver by CXCL9 and CXCL10, is
well known, although studied in a murine model
of hepatitis B (Iannacone et al. 2007).
Very recently, a unique mechanism for
CXCL10 production in HAV-infected cells was
elucidated. HAV RNA is sensed by pathogen-associated molecular pattern receptors such as
MDA5 in the cytosol or TLR3 in the endosome
(Fig. 5). However, downstream signals are interrupted byHAVproteins.Anintermediateproduct

3CD, cleaves TRIF (Qu et al. 2011). In addition,
the HAV 3Cpro protease cleaves NEMO (Wang
et al. 2014). Although HAV blocks signals downstream from MDA5 and TLR3 by such mechanisms, type III interferon (IFN)-λs and CXCL10
are produced by HAV-infected cells, particularly
at an early stage of HAV infection (Sung et al.
2017).CXCL10is producedinHAV-infected cells
in a MAVS and IRF3-dependent manner (Fig. 5)
(Sung et al. 2017). However, secreted type I or
III IFNs are not requiredfor CXCL10 production.
This finding corresponds to the fact that CXCL10
expression is increased in the liver and blood of
HAV-infected chimpanzees, whereas IFN responses are minimally induced in the infected liver (Lanford et al. 2011). This mechanism may be
pivotal for liver inflammation during HAV infection, as it induces the production of CXCL10 even
without IFNs. Similarfindings have been reported
in a murine model of hepatitis A (see below)
(Hirai-Yuki et al. 2016a).
Regulatory T Cells
In immune-mediated host injury, regulatory T
(Treg) cells can modulate effector T-cell activity.
Treg cells have been shown to play a role in liver
injury regulation during acute HAV infections.
The number of circulating CD4+
CD25+Foxp3+
Treg cells is diminished by Fas-mediated apoptosis during hepatitis A (Choi et al. 2015). In
addition, the suppressive function of Treg cells
can be directly inhibited by the binding of HAV
particles to TIM-1 expressed by Treg cells (Manangeeswaran et al. 2012). Furthermore, the
number of Treg cells in the blood and the suppressive activity of the total Treg cell population
are inversely correlated with serum ALT levels
(Choi et al. 2015). These data indicate that decreased CD4+
CD25+Foxp3+ Treg cell population activity is associated with severe liver injury
during hepatitis A. However, the frequency of
circulating Treg cells does not correlate with the
frequency of HAV-specific, IFN-γ-producing
CD8+ T cells in the blood (Choi et al. 2015).
Further studies are required to identify the effector cells mainly targeted by the suppressive
activity of Treg cells during hepatitis A and to
clarify how reduced Treg cell population frequencies and activities are related to liver injury.
A Murine Model of HAV Infection
As described above, the mechanisms responsible for immune-mediated liver injury have not
yet been clearly elucidated. This is in part attributed to the absence of a small animal model for
HAV infection and hepatitis A. Recently, a murine model of HAV infection with human hepatitis A features was described (Hirai-Yuki et al.
2016a). In this study, mice lacking the type I IFN
receptor or both type I and II IFN receptors were
inoculated intravenously with HAV, resulting in
the development of features typifying human
hepatitis A, including fecal virus shedding, viremia, increased serum ALT levels, necrosis or
apoptosis of hepatocytes, and infiltration of the
liver by inflammatory cells, including macrophages, natural killer cells, and CD4+ and
CD8+ T cells (Hirai-Yuki et al. 2016a). Further
analyses with this model revealed that hepatocellular apoptosis and hepatic inflammation occurs by a MAVS and IRF3/7-dependent, but
IFN-independent mechanism (Hirai-Yuki et
al. 2016a). In this model, multiple cytokines

and chemokines were expressed in the liver by
the same mechanism (Hirai-Yuki et al. 2016a),
corresponding with the recent finding in human
cells described above (Sung et al. 2017). This
study revealed the critical role of MAVS signaling in liver injury induced by HAV infection
using a unique murine model. However, it remains to be confirmed whether this model exactly recapitulates the mechanisms of pathogenesis of hepatitis A in humans.

hepatocytes. HAV RNA is sensed by MDA5 in the cytosol or TLR3 in the endosome. However, downstream signaling is interrupted by HAV proteins as described in the text. Nonetheless, interferon λ (IFN-λ) and CXCL10 are
produced from HAV-infected cells, particularly at an early stage of HAV infection. CXCL10 is produced in HAVinfected cells in a MAVS- and IRF3-dependent but IFN-independent manner. CXCL10 can contribute to liver
inflammation and hepatocyte injury by recruiting CXCR3+ immune cells to the HAV-infected liver.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
In regions with inadequate levels of sanitation,
HAV is readily propagated among children and
often results in a self-limited, asymptomatic,
and subclinical infection, which induces neutralizing antibodies that confer lifelong protective immunity. Thus, improvements in sanitation increase the size of the HAV-naïve adult
population susceptible to HAV infection. In
this situation, increasing numbers of individuals
can be infected at older ages, leading to more
severe clinical manifestations and greater disease burden. Currently, inactivated HAV vaccines that elicit neutralizing antibodies are available, and vaccination will largely reduce the
incidence of HAV infection and symptomatic
hepatitis.
Although liver injury in hepatitis A is known
to be caused by immune-mediated events, the
exact pathogenesis mechanisms have not yet
been clarified. Immune-mediated mechanisms
of liver injury are common to the pathogenesis
of hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C (Shin
et al. 2016a). Elucidating the immunopathogenesis of hepatitis A will not only lead to better
clinical management of hepatitis A patients,
but could also facilitate the development of novel therapeutic approaches reducing liver injury
in patients with hepatitis B or C.
