The goal of a virus particle is to transport
its genome in a replication-competent form
from an infected cell to an uninfected cell.
To enter a new host cell, the majority of
viruses take advantage of the endocytic
mechanisms of the cell and wait
until reaching endocytic vacuoles or
other cytoplasmic compartments before
penetrating into the cytosol. After
penetration, viruses and viral capsids
exploit the cytoplasmic transport systems
of the cell, moving to sites of replication
within the cytosol (most RNA viruses) or
the nucleus (most DNA viruses). The final
step in the entry process generally involves
uncoating of the viral genome.
After numerous entry studies with a
variety of viruses in different cell systems,
the overall picture of entry of animal virus
into the host cell is becoming increasingly
complete. There are essentially six locations
for penetration. These are: (1) the plasma
membrane, (2) the early endosome, (3)
the maturing endosome, (4) the late
endosome, (5) the macropinosome and
(6) the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).
Endolysosomes, amphisomes and
lysosomes also remain possible penetration
sites, but evidence is lacking. Some viruses
can use more than one pathway, for example,
by engaging different receptors.
Although the molecular details of virus–
cell surface interactions are complex and
highly variable, the number of pathways
that allow the viruses to reach their sites of
penetration seem to be limited to a handful
of endocytic mechanisms. The subsequent
trafficking steps involve key organelles in
the endocytic network that are utilized by
endogenous cargo. Only a few viruses
seem to be capable of penetrating directly
through the cell surface by fusing their
envelope with the plasma membrane.
Thus, the ‘trail map’ that is available to
incoming viruses is complex, but far from
incomprehensible.
In this Cell Science at a Glance article,
we describe the stepwise entry program of
animal viruses of different families.
As illustrated in the poster, the process
can be broken down into five discrete
steps – attachment, signaling, endocytosis,
(See poster insert)

penetration and uncoating. A more detailed
description can be found in previous
reviews (Damm and Pelkmans, 2006;
Greber, 2002; Grove and Marsh, 2011;
Gruenberg, 2009; Marsh and Helenius,
2006; Mercer and Helenius, 2009; Mercer
et al., 2010; Schelhaas, 2010; Sieczkarski
and Whittaker, 2002).
Attachment
The first step involves attachment of the
virus particle to the cell surface.
Depending on the virus, the viral proteins
responsible for binding form either
projections (glycoprotein spikes, fibers)
or depressions in the virus surface. The
cell surface molecules and groups that
serve as binding partners comprise a large
spectrum of proteins, lipids and glycans
(see poster) (Barth et al., 2003; Bartlett and
Park, 2010; Bose and Banerjee, 2002;
Byrnes and Griffin, 1998; Chen et al.,
1997; Drobni et al., 2003; Kroschewski
et al., 2003; Spear et al., 2000;
Summerford and Samulski, 1998). The
binding specificity of a virus defines in
many cases cell and tissue tropism as well
as the nature of diseases caused by the
virus.
Some of the attachment factors used by
viruses might simply help to concentrate
the virus particles to the cell surface.
Others involve true receptors, which in
addition to binding, actively promote virus
endocytosis, mediate conformational
changes in the virus particle and trigger
signaling pathways that promote the
infection process. Individual contacts
between viral proteins and receptors are
often highly specific but of low affinity
(reviewed by Skehel and Wiley, 2000).
However, being multivalent, viruses
usually bind to multiple receptors. This
not only enhances avidity, but also allows
the formation of receptor-rich membrane
microdomains that might induce transbilayer signaling, support membrane
curvature generation and activate
endocytosis. Receptors often follow the
virus into the cell during endocytosis
(Helenius, 2007).
Cell surface lectins, such as dendritic
cell-specific intercellular adhesion
molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DCSIGN, also known as CD209), constitute
a group of receptors that are subject to
current interest. They function as receptors
for incoming viruses because they bind to
high-mannose N-linked glycans in
glycoproteins of viruses such as HIV1,
Sindbis, hepatitis C, phlebo-, dengue and
Ebola (Geijtenbeek et al., 2000; Klimstra
et al., 2003; Lozach et al., 2011b; Lozach
et al., 2003; Po¨hlmann et al., 2001;
Simmons et al., 2003; Tassaneetrithep
et al., 2003). While playing an important
role in the immunological defense against
these and other pathogens, DC-SIGN can
thus inadvertently open the door for
infection by allowing virus entry and by
promoting virus spread in the body
(reviewed by Svajger et al., 2010).
After binding to the cell surface, many
viruses move laterally along the cell
surface before internalization. The
movement can either involve random
diffusion or it can be directed. The latter
is the case for viruses that bind to filopodia
and ‘surf’ towards the cell body through
actin retrograde flow (Burckhardt et al.,
2011; Coller et al., 2009; Lehmann et al.,
2005; Mercer and Helenius, 2008;
Schelhaas et al., 2008) (reviewed by
Burckhardt and Greber, 2009).
Signaling
Following attachment and receptor
clustering, many viruses prime the cell
for entry and infection by activating the
signaling systems of the cell (see poster)
(reviewed by Greber, 2002; Mercer et al.,
2010; Nemerow, 2000). The signaling
pathways are best characterized for
viruses that trigger plasma membrane
ruffling and macropinocytosis for
endocytic uptake. These include vaccinia
virus (VACV), Ebola virus, Kaposi’s
sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV),
adenovirus and influenza A virus (IAV)
(Amstutz et al., 2008; Brindley et al., 2011;
Chakraborty et al., 2011; de Vries et al.,
2011; Eierhoff et al., 2010; Hunt et al.,
2011; Ka¨lin et al., 2010; Meertens et al.,
2012; Meier et al., 2002; Mercer and
Helenius, 2008; Nanbo et al., 2010;
Raghu et al., 2009; Saeed et al., 2010;
Schmidt et al., 2011; Shimojima et al.,
2006; Valiya Veettil et al., 2010).
Typically, the process involves
activation of receptor tyrosine kinases
(RTKs), integrins and phosphatidylserine
receptors of the TIM (T cell/
transmembrane, immunoglobulin and
mucin) and TAM (Tyro3, Axl, Mer)
families, followed by activation of
downstream players, such as Na+
/H+
exchangers, Rho GTPases (RAC1 and
CDC42), p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1),
PI3Ks, Src kinases, protein kinase C
(PKC), myosins, and membrane fission
and fusion factors. The dynamics of the
actin cytoskeleton are transiently modified
and the viruses are internalized in large
uncoated vacuoles (reviewed by Mercer
and Helenius, 2012; Wolfrum and Greber,
2013).
The caveolar and lipid raft-mediated
entry of SV40 into HeLa cells is
regulated by more than 40 kinases,
including focal adhesion kinase (FAK),
Src kinase and members of cell adhesiondependent signaling, such as FYN and
AKT1 (Pelkmans et al., 2005). Binding of
Group B coxsackievirus (CVB) to its
receptor GPI-anchored protein decayaccelerating factor (DAF) on the
epithelial surface induces DAF clustering.
This triggers activation of Abl kinase to
deliver the virus to the tight junctions
where it interacts with its receptor CAR,
and by activation of FYN to induce
endocytosis (Coyne and Bergelson, 2006).
Fusion at the plasma membrane
Only a few viruses can deliver their
capsids to the cytosol by fusing their
envelope directly with the plasma
membrane (see poster). For example,
alpha herpesviruses undergo such fusion
events following the engagement of the
glycoproteins gB and gD with cellular
receptors (Arii et al., 2010; Geraghty et al.,
1998; Montgomery et al., 1996; Satoh
et al., 2008; Shukla et al., 1999; Suenaga
et al., 2010) (reviewed by Eisenberg et al.,
2012). After binding of gp120 to CD4,
further interactions with chemokine
receptor CCR5 or CXCR4 trigger gp41-
mediated fusion of HIV1 (Alkhatib et al.,
1996; Choe et al., 1996; Deng et al., 1996;
Dragic et al., 1996; Feng et al., 1996;
Klatzmann et al., 1984) (reviewed by
Klasse, 2012).
Endocytosis
Endocytosis of viruses can take
many forms, including clathrin-mediated
endocytosis (CME), caveolar or lipid raftmediated endocytosis, macropinocytosis
and still poorly characterized variations
of these themes (see poster) (reviewed by
Mercer et al., 2010). Some viruses are able
to use more than one pathway, which
introduces a further level of ambiguity to
the classification of virus entry pathways.
For example spherical IAV can activate
macropinocytosis (de Vries et al., 2011).
However, in most of the cases, the virus
recruits clathrin and epsin1, and enters
clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) through
clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) (Chen and
Zhuang, 2008; Matlin et al., 1981; Rust
et al., 2004).
1290 Journal of Cell Science 126 (6)

Journal of Cell Science
CME is commonly observed as the
uptake mechanism for viruses of small
and intermediate size (Helenius et al.,
1980). Clathrin-coated vesicles have a
diameter of 60–200 nm (Kirchhausen,
2000; Pearse, 1976), but as shown for
vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), the
vesicles can be deformed to fit larger
particles (Cureton et al., 2009). Some
viruses, such as dengue, enter preexisting
CCPs (van der Schaar et al., 2008),
whereas others, such as reovirus, VSV
and IAV, induce formation of CCPs at
their site of binding (Ehrlich et al., 2004;
Johannsdottir et al., 2009; Rust et al.,
2004).
Macropinocytosis is an actin-dependent,
transient, endocytic process for the
nonspecific uptake of fluid, solutes and
sometimes particles in response to the
activation of cell surface receptors (Meier
et al., 2002; West et al., 1989). It is an
important entry pathway for a growing
number of predominantly larger viruses,
such as poxviruses, filoviruses, IAV,
adenovirus and HIV1 (Brindley et al.,
2011; Callahan et al., 2003; de Vries
et al., 2011; Hunt et al., 2011; Mercer
and Helenius, 2008; Nanbo et al., 2010;
Saeed et al., 2010; Shimojima et al.,
2006). As already mentioned, the process
involves the activation of a complex
signaling pathway that transiently
modifies the dynamics of the actin
cytoskeleton. The virus-containing
macropinosomes then move deeper into
the cytoplasm where they undergo
acidification, maturation and fusion with
late endosomes or lysosomes.
To elicit macropinocytosis, some viruses
have learned to disguise themselves as cell
debris or apoptotic bodies. For example,
VACV uses phosphatidylserine on its
membrane to mimic an apoptotic body
that is destined for degradation (Mercer
and Helenius, 2008). This mode of entry is
also used by lentiviral vectors and dengue
virus (Meertens et al., 2012; Morizono
et al., 2011).
Viruses in the polyomavirus family bind
to gangliosides on the cell surface. They
either enter through caveolar indentations
in the plasma membrane or generate such
indentations by tight binding to receptors.
Internalization occurs in small tight-fitting
vesicles that are devoid of a clathrin coat
(Eash et al., 2006; Ewers et al., 2010;
Hummeler et al., 1970; Kartenbeck et al.,
1989). Like viruses that are internalized by
CME, these viruses are transported to early
endosomes and they follow the flow to late
endosomes. Eventually, they reach the ER
where initial uncoating and penetration
into the cytosol occurs (Engel et al., 2011;
Geiger et al., 2011; Inoue and Tsai, 2011;
Schelhaas et al., 2007).
Endosomes
The endosomal network that receives the
incoming viruses is composed of several
different types of organelles. These are
dynamic, and are involved in complicated
trafficking and sorting processes that
include hundreds of cellular factors. The
internalized viruses are either directed to
early endosomes or they move along as
cargo in newly formed macropinosomes.
Both endosomes and macropinosomes
are mildly acidic and contain cargo that
is being targeted to lysosomes for
degradation. In both cases, transport
involves a maturation process that
prepares the vacuoles for fusion with
the hydrolase-filled lysosomes. The
maturation process of endosomes involves
further acidification, followed by the
formation of intralumenal vesicles, a
switch from RAB5 to RAB7, a switch
in phosphatidylinositides and, finally,
microtubule-mediated movement towards
the perinuclear region (reviewed by
Huotari and Helenius, 2011).
Depending on the requirements, which
differ between viruses (for example the pH
needed to activate membrane fusion),
penetration into the cytosol is triggered
either in the early or in the late endosomes
or macropinosomes. Thus, late penetrating
viruses, unlike those that exit from early
endosomes, not only depend on a further
drop in pH, but also on factors that are
required for the maturation process, such
as RAB5, RAB7, and ESCRT (endosomal
sorting complex required for transport)
components (Lozach et al., 2011a). For
example, we have found that depletion of
histone deacetylase 8 (HDAC8) blocks
centrosome cohesion and microtubule
organization (Yamauchi et al., 2011),
and depletion of Cullin-3 affects
endolysosomal trafficking (Huotari et al.,
2012). Infection by IAV, which is a late
penetrating virus, is blocked in both cases.
Penetration
The penetration event involves the delivery
of the genome and accessory proteins to
the cytosol. It is one of few events during
virus entry that requires an active process
initiated by the virus. In the case of
enveloped animal viruses, penetration
invariably involves membrane fusion,
which is mediated by specific viral
glycoproteins. As a result of fusion, viral
capsids are released into the cytosol.
Endosomes and macropinosomes are the
most common sites for these fusion events.
Here, the viruses fuse their envelope with
the limiting membrane of the endocytic
vacuoles from the lumenal side (Helenius
et al., 1980).
The viral fusion proteins are oligomeric
type I integral membrane proteins. After a
conformational change, which is induced
by cellular cues such as the low pH, they
expose hydrophobic peptides in their
ectodomains. By inserting these peptides
into the target membranes, the viral fusion
proteins form a bridge between the virus
and the endosomal membrane (reviewed
by Harrison, 2005). Fusion occurs when
further conformational changes in the
fusion proteins bring the two membranes
into close contact. Cues other than pH,
such as lipid composition, proteolytic
cleavage and redox reactions, can also
have a role in the reaction (Bertram et al.,
2011; Simmons et al., 2011; Simmons
et al., 2005; Wahlberg and Garoff, 1992;
Zaitseva et al., 2010).
The mechanisms of penetration by
non-enveloped viruses are less well
characterized. Adenoviruses cause the
lysis of endosomes, allowing escape
into the cytosol (Meier et al., 2002).
Picornaviruses undergo a conformational
change that allows the particles to form a
pore through which the viral RNA is
released into the cytosol (Prchla et al.,
1995; Schober et al., 1998). Parvoviruses
have acid-activated phospholipase activity,
which is thought to help their escape
from vacuoles (Farr et al., 2005).
Polyomaviruses pass through the ER
and take advantage of ER-associated
degradation (ERAD) pathways to
penetrate into the cytosol (Geiger et al.,
2011; Inoue and Tsai, 2011; Schelhaas
et al., 2007).
Intracellular transport
After reaching the cytosol, viruses and
viral capsids have to find their way to the
site of replication in the nucleus or to
specific locations in the cytoplasm. Many
associate with microtubule-based motors,
such as dynein and dynactin, and move
along microtubules towards the nucleus
(Bremner et al., 2009; Dodding and Way,
2011; Do¨hner et al., 2002; Engelke et al.,
2011; Leopold et al., 2000; Radtke et al.,
2010; Sodeik et al., 1997; Suomalainen
et al., 1999; Yamauchi et al., 2008). For
Journal of Cell Science 126 (6) 1291

Journal of Cell Science
transport into the nucleus, they bind
nuclear import receptors, such as
importins, by using them to target their
capsids or genome to nuclear pore
complexes (NPCs) (Darshan et al., 2004;
Klucevsek et al., 2006; Nakanishi et al.,
2002; Schmitz et al., 2010; Wodrich et al.,
2006) (reviewed by Puntener and Greber,
2009).
Large virus capsids, such as those of
herpes- and adenoviruses, are too large to
enter the nucleus through the NPCs. They
have evolved mechanisms to release only
their DNA genome through NPCs (Greber
et al., 1997; Jovasevic et al., 2008; Ojala
et al., 2000; Pasdeloup et al., 2009; Preston
et al., 2008; Strunze et al., 2011). Viruses
with smaller capsids, such as hepatitis B
and polyoma viruses, can enter through the
pores in either an intact or modified form
(Kann et al., 1999; Nakanishi et al., 1996;
Qu et al., 2004; Rabe et al., 2009; Rabe
et al., 2003). Influenza virus has solved the
problem of excessive genome size by
dividing its genome into eight separate
RNA segments, which are packaged
individually into viral ribonucleoproteins
(vRNPs) that are small enough to enter
through the pores. Each vRNP contains
nuclear localization signals necessary for
importin a- and b-mediated nuclear import
(Boulo et al., 2007; Cros et al., 2005;
Kemler et al., 1994; Mayer et al., 2007;
Wu et al., 2007).
Uncoating
The final step in the entry program of most
viruses is the release of the genome from a
protective, confining capsid structure to
enable transcription and replication. As a
rule, this occurs once the virus capsids
have reached the final location. This is
because the viral RNA or DNA cannot be
easily moved once liberated from the
capsid. Actually, uncoating is typically a
stepwise process that occurs during
different stages of entry. In some cases,
such as polyoma and adenoviruses,
disassembly of the particle already begins
before penetration into the cytosol
(reviewed by Cerqueira and Schelhaas,
2012; Suomalainen and Greber, 2013). In
the case of picornaviruses, uncoating is an
integral part of penetration, as the viral
RNA enters into the cytosol leaving the
capsid behind in the endosome (reviewed
by Fuchs and Blaas, 2010).
The picture emerging from uncoating
studies suggests that mechanisms are
highly variable. Some viruses rely on
host cell factors, such as ribosomes,
proteasomes and molecular motors,
whereas others employ their own
structural components, such as proteolytic
enzymes (Helenius, 2007). Adenoviruses
exploit dynein, kinesin and nucleoporins to
impose physical forces to open up viral
capsids that are attached to the NPC (see
poster) (Greber et al., 1993; Pe´rez-Berna´
et al., 2012; Strunze et al., 2011).
Uncoating of HIV1 is determined by host
factors, such as cyclophilin A and
TRIM5a, by the stability of the capsid,
and by reverse transcription of viral RNA
into DNA, and is stimulated by TNPO3, a
nuclear import receptor (Arhel et al., 2007;
Sayah et al., 2004; Shah et al., 2013;
Stremlau et al., 2004; Stremlau et al.,
2006).
Perspectives
Ongoing studies in the field of endocytic
membrane trafficking are providing us
with increasingly detailed information
about the interactions between host cells
and pathogens. Screening efforts using
drugs and small interfering RNAs are, at
the same time, rapidly expanding our
understanding of the cellular factors
involved. Whereas viruses themselves
owing to their relative simplicity offer
few targets for antivirals, the virus–cell
interactions provide numerous potential
targets. However, in order to be able to
develop antiviral strategies aiming at
cellular rather than viral targets, more
information is required regarding the host
cells, especially about the processes by
which the cells promote and oppose
infection. To fully exploit such
information, which is increasingly
complex, interdisciplinary approaches will
be necessary, combining cell biology,
infection biology, systems biology,
bioinformatics, medicine and other fields.
Important questions remain: will it be
possible to make use of the information
regarding virus entry to develop new
drugs? Can processes, such as
macropinocytosis and endosome
maturation, temporarily be shut off to
prevent infection and give the immune
system time to set up its defenses? Can one
interfere with receptor binding and
signaling? Can infection be impeded
without major side effects to the
host? Some successful examples, such
as enfuvirtide (fusion inhibitor) and
maraviroc (CCR5 antagonist) used in
patients infected with HIV1 (Dorr et al.,
2005; Kilby et al., 1998; Matthews et al.,
2004), suggest that these approaches are
realistic.
