Abstract
Microfibrillar-associated protein 4 (MFAP4) is located in the extracellular matrix (ECM). We sought to identify tissues with
high levels of MFAP4 mRNA and MFAP4 protein expression. Moreover, we aimed to evaluate the significance of MFAP4 as a
marker of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and to correlate MFAP4 with other known ECM markers, such as fibulin-1,
osteoprotegerin (OPG), and osteopontin (OPN). Quantitative real-time PCR demonstrated that MFAP4 mRNA was more
highly expressed in the heart, lung, and intestine than in other elastic tissues. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated
high levels of MFAP4 protein mainly at sites rich in elastic fibers and within blood vessels in all tissues investigated. The
AlphaLISA technique was used to determine serum MFAP4 levels in a clinical cohort of 172 patients consisting of 5 matched
groups with varying degrees of CVD: 1: patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), 2: patients with non-STEMI,
3: patients destined for vascular surgery because of various atherosclerotic diseases (stable atherosclerotic disease), 4:
apparently healthy individuals with documented coronary artery calcification (CAC-positive), and 5: apparently healthy
individuals without signs of coronary artery calcification (CAC-negative). Serum MFAP4 levels were significantly lower in
patients with stable atherosclerotic disease than CAC-negative individuals (p,0.05). Furthermore, lower serum MFAP4 levels
were present in patients with stable atherosclerotic disease compared with STEMI and non-STEMI patients (p,0.05). In
patients with stable atherosclerotic disease, positive correlations between MFAP4 and both fibulin-1 (r = 0.50; p = 0.0244)
and OPG (r = 0.62; p = 0.0014) were found. Together, these results indicate that MFAP4 is mainly located in elastic fibers and
is highly expressed in blood vessels. The present study suggests that serum MFAP4 varies in groups of patients with
different cardiovascular conditions. Further studies are warranted to describe the role of serum MFAP4 as a biomarker of
stable atherosclerotic disease.

Introduction
Microfibrillar-associated protein 4 (MFAP4) is a matricellular
protein belonging to the fibrinogen-related protein superfamily.
This family also includes fibroleukin, ficolins, FIBCD1, angiopoietins, and tenascins, which play multifaceted roles in innate
immunity, the development of the cardiovascular system, and the
normal functioning of the endothelium [1–5]. The MFAP4 gene
consists of a signal peptide, a short N-terminal region comprising
an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence followed by the C-terminus [6].
The RGD sequence is the ligand motif for cell surface integrins
and is associated with cell adhesive activity [7]. The MFAP4
protein is a disulfide-linked dimer that forms higher oligomeric
structures [8].
MFAP4 has considerable sequence homology with the 36-kDa
bovine microfibril-associated glycoprotein (MAGP-36), which was
first discovered in porcine aorta and has since been detected in a
wide variety of elastic tissues [9,10]. Both MFAP4 and MAGP-36

bind to elastin and collagen fibers [8,11–13]. Elastic fibers and
collagen fibers are components of the extracellular matrix (ECM)
that ensure the structural integrity of the ECM by maintaining the
elasticity in the arterial wall, lungs, skin, and other dynamic
connective tissues [14]. The biological function of MFAP4 is not
fully documented; however, MFAP4 may interact with fibrillin-1
in dermal tissue, suggesting a role for MFAP4 in skin homeostasis
during skin photobleaching [12]. MFAP4 has been proposed as a
new candidate gene for left-sided congenital heart syndrome [15],
and using proteome analysis, MFAP4 expression has been
associated with aortic aneurysms [16,17], pulmonary hypertension
[18] and cirrhotic disease [19]. In cirrhotic tissues, MFAP4
synthesis is associated with ECM remodeling, and the accumulation of MFAP4 was observed in cirrhotic tissues and in the
circulation of cirrhotic patients, suggesting measurements of serum
MFAP4 levels as a biomarker for cirrhotic disease [19].
Altered vascular and cardiac ECM remodeling is evident in
cardiovascular diseases (CVD) [20]. The use of biomarkers in
CVD has become increasingly important because pathologyrelated vascular and cardiac remodeling is initiated before the
appearance of clinical symptoms [21]. Biomarkers that reflect
abnormal remodeling might be beneficial for the early diagnosis of
CVD, and circulating proteins from ECM turnover are thought to
identify such changes [22,23].
In the current study, we initially aimed to establish the presence
and localization of MFAP4 in human tissues. We used molecular
biology techniques to characterize the gene expression profile of
MFAP4 in various normal human tissues. qPCR was used to
compare the mRNA expression levels and immunohistochemistry
analysis was performed to investigate the localization of the
MFAP4 protein. Cell culture experiments were implemented to
determine relevant cell types synthesizing MFAP4. Subsequently,
we evaluated whether the amount of serum MFAP4 is associated
with different degrees of atherosclerotic CVD in a clinical cohort
(n = 172) with comparable gender and age profiles.
Materials and Methods
Production of Monoclonal Anti-MFAP4 Antibodies
C57BL6/N MFAP4-null mice were immunized for the
production of monoclonal antibodies against MFAP4. In brief,
the mice were immunized five times with approximately 10 mg of
recombinant V5-His tagged MFAP4, produced as previously
described [8], with two weeks between each immunization. The
mice were boosted three times with 10 mg of recombinant V5-Histagged MFAP4 diluted in 200 ml of PBS by injection into the
dorsal tail vein. Mice were terminated by cervical dislocation and
B-cell hybridomas were produced by fusion between splenocytes
and myeloma cells (ATCC, CRL-2016, Sp2/mIl-6) as described
previously [24]. Antibodies were purified using a HiTrap Protein
G column (GE Healthcare cat. no. 17-0404-01) on A¨ KTA FPLC
system (GE Healthcare). Mice were housed in Macrolon type II
cages. Cages contained aspen woodchip bedding (Tapvei,
Brogaarden, Gentofte, Denmark) and nesting material (EnviroDri,
Brogarden, Gentofte, Denmark). All mice had access to chow,
Altromin 1324 (Altromin International, Germany), and water ad
libitum. The environment was controlled with respect to
temperature (21–24uC), humidity and illumination (12 hour
light/dark cycle with a 30 minute sunrise and dawn function.
The use of the C57Bl6/N MFAP4-null mice and production of
monoclonal antibodies were performed under a license obtained
from The national Animal Experiments Inspectorate.
Cell Culture
In general, cells were grown at 37uC in a 5% CO2 humidified
incubator (Hera cell, Heraeus). The human cardiomyocytes from

Innoprot were cultured in Cardiac Myocyte Medium (Innoprot)
for two days. Fetal human aorta vascular smooth muscle cells
(VSMCs) (Cell Application, Inc.) derived from the normal human
tunica intima and tunica media of fetal aortas were allowed to
differentiate in a VSMC differentiating medium for ten days (Cell
application, Inc.). Once the cell cultures reached 90% confluence
the cell culture supernatants were removed and centrifuged at
10006g for 10 min. Then, 0.05% azide was added, and the cell
culture supernatant was stored at 4uC until further analysis. The
cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and used
for RNA and protein analysis.
Quantitative Real-time PCR (qPCR)
Total RNA was obtained from whole organs from various
human tissues (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). cDNA synthesis was
performed from 1 mg of purified RNA using an oligo(dT)18 primer
and the Superscript III reverse transcriptase according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations (Invitrogen).
Total RNA was obtained from human cardiomyocytes and
differentiating VSMCs using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen,
Ballerup, Denmark). RNA extraction was quantified on a
NanoDrop spectrophotometer by measurement of the optical
density at 260 nm, and cDNA synthesis was performed from 1 mg
of purified RNA using the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription kit
according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (Qiagen).
The Taqman primers and probes for MFAP4
(Hs00412974_m1) and b-actin (Hs99999903_m1) genes were
obtained from Applied Biosystems. Analysis was performed in
triplicate using cycles of 50uC for 2 min and 95uC for 10 min,
followed by 40 cycles of 95uC for 15 s and 60uC for 1 min on a
7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The normalized quantity of MFAP4 was calculated as 22DCt, where DCt was
obtained directly by subtracting Ct for MFAP4 from Ct for the bactin gene.
Ethics Statement
Human tissues were used for analysis by immunohistochemistry.
Human healthy tissues and tissues from patients with acute
myocardial infarction (AMI) were obtained from the diagnostic
Biobank at the Department of Pathology, Odense University
Hospital (Odense, Denmark). The Regional Scientific Ethical
Committee for Southern Denmark approved the use of the healthy

human tissue sections for research purposes (Ref. No
VF20050070) and samples were obtained from patients with
written informed consent. Moreover, the Regional Scientific
Ethical Committee for Southern Denmark approved the use of
diseased tissue sections with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) (S20130056).
Immunohistochemistry Procedure
Immunohistochemical staining was carried out on a Dako
Autostainer Universal Staining System (Dako, Denmark A/S,
Glostrup, Denmark). The 4-mm paraffin sections were dewaxed
with xylene and rehydrated through a gradient of alcohols.
Endogenous biotin reactivity was blocked with 1.5% hydrogen
peroxide. Epitope retrieval was performed by protease treatment
(0.05% protease type XIV; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO).
Sections were then incubated for 60 min with monoclonal antiMFAP4 (HG-HYB7-14) antibody diluted in TNT Antibody
Diluent (Dako Denmark A/S). Visualization of the antigen–
antibody complex was carried out with the PowerVision+ (Leica,
Denmark A/S) detections system according to the manufacturer’s
manual. DAB was used as a chromogen (K3468, Dako). Finally,
sections were counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin (Bie &
Berntsen, Herlev, Denmark) for 2 min, and coverslips were
mounted with Aquatex (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). The

specificity of the immuno-staining was verified by omission of the
primary antibody. Tissues were photographed with a Leica
DMLB microscope and a Leica DFC 300 FX camera using the
computer image analysis system LASV3.6.
Protein Purification and Western Blotting
After removing the culture supernatant, VSMCs and cardiomyocytes were washed in PBS, followed by adding 600 ml/flask of
cold RIPA buffer consisting of TBS, 1% NP-40 (Sigma-Aldrich),
1% sodium deoxycholate (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.1% SDS, and a mini
complete protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche). Subsequently,
the flask was put on ice and allowed to incubate on a shaking table
for 20 min. The cell suspension was transferred to an Eppendorf
tube and centrifuged at 10,0006g for 10 min. The supernatant
was transferred to a new Eppendorf tube and stored at 220uC
until further protein analysis. SDS-PAGE samples were mixed
with SDS-PAGE buffer (40% (v/v) glycerol, 8% (W,v) SDS, 25%
(v/v) 4x lower Tris (pH 8.8), 0.002% brophenol blue) and added
0.02 M iodoacetamide (IAA). The samples were heated to 100uC
for 1 min and finally alkylated by the of 1.4 M IAA. Protein lysates
and culture supernatant were separated on 4–12% (w/v)
polyacrylamide gradient gels (CriterionTM XT Precast Gel) with
a discontinuous buffer system (MOPS SDS running buffer,
NuPAGE, Invitrogen) and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride
membrane (PVDF) membrane (Amersham HybondTM-P). The
pre-stained precision plus protein standards (Bio-Rad) marker was
used.
Two membranes were prepared with either protein lysate or cell
culture supernatant. The membranes were incubated with
monoclonal anti-MFAP4 (HG-HYP 7-5) antibody diluted to
0.5 mg/ml in TBS, 0.1% (w/w) TWEEN 20 with 5% (w/v) nonfat milk (Bio-Rad) at 4uC overnight. In addition, the membrane
with protein lysate was incubated with mouse monoclonal antiGAPDH antibody (6C5, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted to
1:10,000. Next day, the membranes were washed and incubated
with rabbit anti-mouse HRP-labeled immunoglobulin (Dako)
diluted to 1:20,000 in TBS containing 0.1% (w/w) TWEEN 20
and supplemented with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk for 1 h at RT.

University Hospital in Denmark. The groups were chosen to
investigate the associations between biomarkers and differences in
the degree or type of ischemic heart disease. Each group was
matched with regard to sex and age. Groups 1 and 2 included
patients initially enrolled in the DEF-AMI [25,26]. This study
consecutively enrolled patients admitted with suspected myocardial infarction, and for the present study, 29 patients diagnosed
with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and 23 patients
diagnosed with non-STEMI were selected. Blood sampling was
performed within the first 24 h of symptom onset. Group 3
included patients from the Odense Artery Biobank, which collects
spare arterial tissue and blood samples from coronary bypass and
other operations. Of the included patients, 30 patients with stable
atherosclerotic disease underwent elective coronary artery bypass
grafting, carotid atherectomies, or other bypass surgery. The
patients were enrolled prior to the operation. Blood samples were
taken the day before the bypass operation. Groups 4 and 5
comprised individuals initially enrolled in the DanRisk study [27],
a population-based survey of patients born in either 1949 or 1959
living in the southern region of Denmark. Persons with diagnosed
CVD or diabetes mellitus were excluded from the study. All
subjects in groups 4 and 5 underwent a cardiac CT scan with
assessment of the coronary artery calcium score (Agatston score).
Group 4 (CAC-positive) included persons with CAC (n = 30),
defined as an Agatston score above the 90th percentile for healthy

individuals of the same age and gender (498–4220). Subjects in
group 5 (CAC-negative) had no CAC (n = 60).
In all groups, blood samples were drawn in tubes with EDTA
and centrifuged at 2,0006g for 10 min. Serum was stored at
280uC until biochemical analysis. The protocols were approved
by the Regional Scientific Ethical Committee for Southern
Denmark (S-20080140, S-20100044, and S-20090082) and were
conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Written
informed consent was obtained from each participant.
Detection of Serum MFAP4 by the AlphaLISA Technique
Monoclonal anti-MFAP4 (HG-HYB 7–14) antibody was
conjugated to AlphaLISA Acceptor beads (Perkin Elmer) at a
concentration of 0.1 mg antibody/mg acceptor beads following
the manufacturer’s instructions. Monoclonal anti-MFAP4 (HGHYB 7–18) was modified by labeling with (+)-biotin N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Sigma H1759) to permit binding to
AlphaLISA streptavidin-coated donor beads. The AlphaLISA
procedure was performed using 384-well microtiter plates (white
opaque OptiPlateTM from Perkin Elmer) containing 5 ml of diluted
serum (final dilution 1:100), 2 nM biotinylated HG-HYB 7–18,
and 10 mg/ml HG-HYB 7–14 conjugated to Acceptor beads in a
total of 20 ml AlphaLISAHHiBlock Buffer (PerkinElmer). The
reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 60 min.
Streptavidin donor beads were then added to reach a final
concentration of 40 mg/ml, and the plate was incubated at room
temperature in the dark for another 30 min, after which time it
was read on an EnVision reader (PerkinElmer) using the
AlphaScreen protocol. Briefly, the AlphaScreen protocol used
AlphaScreen label 384-well Packard OptiPlates and the AlphaScreen 570 emission filter, a flash/time ratio of 0.55, a measurement
height of 1 mm, an excitation time of 0.18 s, and an emission time
of 0.37 s.
The experiments were performed in duplicate except for the
standards and quality controls, which were performed in
quadruplicate. The duplicate sample covariance was accepted if
it was #10%. Standards were prepared by the serial dilution of
MFAP4 overexpressing CHO cell culture supernatant in AlphaLISAHHiBlock Buffer. The concentration of the standard was
estimated by the spiking of a known concentration of rMFAP4 into
the samples. Standards included serial dilutions from 8000 mU/
ml to 7.8 mU/ml. The concentration of rMFAP4 was determined
using Amino Acid Analysis by Alphalyse A/S (Odense, Denmark).
When measured in serum, 1 U/ml = 38 ng/ml. Quality controls
were prepared from human serum pools and from rMFAP4 pools.
One pool was prepared to contain a low content of MFAP4
(QLow), and two pools were spiked with purified rMFAP4 (QMid)
and (QHigh). The three quality controls were included in each
plate. Interplate variation was accepted if all quality control
measurements were within two standard deviations obtained from
.10 consecutive runs.
Quantification of Fibulin-1, Osteoprotegerin, and
Osteopontin in Serum
The serum concentration of fibulin-1, OPG, and OPN was
determined by modified sandwich immunoassays using Europiumlabeled streptavidin and biotin-labeled secondary antibodies for
detection. In the fibulin-1 assay, an affinity-purified polyclonal
antibody was used for coating, and a monoclonal antibody was
used for detection, together with placenta purified fibulin-1 as the
standard, as previously described [28]. Ingredients for the
modified sandwich immunoassays for OPG [29] and OPN were
obtained from R&D systems (cat no. DY805 and DY1433).
Statistical Analysis
Serum MFAP4 levels, stratified by groups, are presented as the
median and 95% confidence intervals. Due to the non-normal
distribution of serum MFAP4, approximation to normal distribution was achieved by logarithmic transformation (ln) before further
statistical analysis. Comparison between groups was done using
ANOVA with the Student t-test as the post hoc analysis. The
association between continuous variables was evaluated by a
pairwise correlation with Sidak-adjusted significance levels. The
association between variables was evaluated with Spearman’s rank
correlation. A p-value below 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
Results
MFAP4 mRNA Expression in Human Tissues
qPCR was performed in 15 different human tissues to
determine MFAP4 mRNA transcript levels. Relative MFAP4
mRNA transcript levels were highest in the heart, small intestine,
and lung, as shown in figure 1. MFAP4 expression was also
observed in the kidney, testis, uterus, smooth muscle, spleen, and
adrenal gland, whereas a low expression of MFAP4 mRNA
transcripts was observed in the trachea, liver, salivary gland, and
prostate. No detectable expression of MFAP4 was observed in the
thymus and brain. All samples were normalized with respect to bactin.
Immunohistochemistry of MFAP4 Protein in Human
Tissues
Human paraffin-embedded tissue sections were stained with the
monoclonal MFAP4-antibody (HG-HYB 7–14) directed against
human MFAP4. In the myocardium, MFAP4 was intensely
detected in elastic fibers located within blood vessels and the
surrounding connective tissue. No staining was seen in cardiomyocytes (Figure 2A). In the lungs, the intensive MFAP4 immunoreactivity was localized to the pulmonary arterioles (Figure 2C)
and interalveolar walls (Figure 2E) but not in alveolar type I and
type II cells. MFAP4 staining was also observed in the tela
submucosa layer of the trachea (Figure 2F). MFAP4 staining of
elastic fibers was observed in the adrenal gland (Figure 3A) and in
the skin (Figure 3B). In the spleen, MFAP4 staining was localized
to the central arteries (Figure 3D) and the trabeculae (Figure 3E).
In the kidney, MFAP4 staining was localized to blood vessels
(Figure 3G). In the liver, staining was seen in blood vessels and the
connective tissues in portal areas (Figure 3H). In the duodenum,
MFAP4 staining was intensely detected in blood vessels located in
the submucosa layer (Figure 3J) and MFAP4 staining was observed
in the lamina propria (Figure 3K). In the genitals, MFAP4 was
visualized in the basal membrane of the testis (Figure 4A) and
prostate (Figure 4F) as well as in the spiral arteries of the uterus
(Figure 4, C and E). In negative control sections with omission of
the primary antibody, no staining was observed. In all sections,
MFAP4 staining appeared extracellularly and was associated with
ECM fibrils.
MFAP4 Synthesizing Cells
We investigated whether MFAP4 protein synthesis was
produced by VSMCs or/and cardiomyocytes. We included
differentiated/contractile human VSMCs and human cardiomyocytes. qPCR revealed that MFAP4 mRNA transcripts were
strongly expressed by differentiated/contractile VSMCs, whereas
in cardiomyocytes, a low expression profile was observed
(Figure 5A). Using protein lysate from the cells, a band of
66 kDa in the unreduced state was detected for MFAP4 in
MFAP4 and Cardiovascular Diseases

differentiated/contractile VSMCs using Western blot analysis
(Figure 5B). Next, we analyzed the cell culture supernatant from
the cell cultures and found that MFAP4 was detected in the cell
culture supernatant from differentiated/contractile VSMCs
(Figure 5C). The data indicate that MFAP4 expression is primarily
synthesized from VSMCs and that cardiomyocytes exhibit a
limited MFAP4 synthesis.
Demographics
Demographic information and biochemical measurements are
presented in Table 1.
Serum MFAP4 Levels in the Systemic Circulation after
AMI Injury
Recent work has revealed that MFAP4 is present in serum [19],
and because we observed MFAP4 to be highly expressed in
VSMCs, we sought to investigate whether serum MFAP4 could
reflect ECM turnover in blood vessels in a clinical cohort with
different degrees of atherosclerotic CVD. The serum MFAP4
median value with 95% confidence intervals was 14 [12;17] U/ml
in the STEMI group, 17 [9;21] U/ml in the non-STEMI group,
10.5 [9;13] U/ml in the stable atherosclerotic disease group, 12
[10;13] U/ml in CAC-positive individuals, and 13 [12;14] U/ml
in CAC-negative individuals (Figure 6). ANOVA demonstrated
that MFAP4 varied significantly among the patient groups.
Confounding variables such as gender, cigarette smoking status,
and hypertension did not affect this relation. Serum MFAP4 levels
were significantly lower in stable atherosclerotic disease patients
compared with CAC-negative individuals (p,0.05). Furthermore,
serum MFAP4 was lower in patients with stable atherosclerotic
disease compared with patients with STEMI and non-STEMI
(p,0.05). In addition, a significant difference was observed in nonSTEMI compared with CAC-positive patients (p,0.05). A
borderline significance was observed in STEMI patients compared
with CAC-positive individuals (p = 0.05).
MFAP4 in Myocardial Injury
To investigate whether cardiomyocytes were able to synthesize
MFAP4 during myocardial necrosis, paraffin-embedded sections
from patients with AMI were included. Histological examination
revealed that cardiomyocytes in the infarcted area showed nucleus
disruption and provided evidence for white blood cell infiltration
(Figure 7A). MFAP4 staining was visualized to elastic fibers located
within the blood vessel and the surrounding connective tissue, and
no staining was detected in the cardiomyocytes (Figure 7B).
Serum MFAP4 Levels Correlate with Fibulin-1, OPG, and
OPN
We sought to further delineate the role of MFAP4 by a
comparison of serum MFAP4 variation with that of fibulin-1,
OPG, and OPN, which are known to be associated with CVD
[25,28,30–32]. As indicated in Table 2, we observed a positive
correlation between serum MFAP4 and fibulin-1 (r = 0.57;
p = 0.0324), OPG (r= 0.74; p = 0.0005), and OPN (r = 0.65;
p = 0.0060) in non-STEMI patients. In patients with stable
atherosclerotic disease, positive correlations between MFAP4
and fibulin-1 (r = 0.50; p = 0.0244) and OPG (r = 0.62;
p = 0.0014) were found. No information on fibulin-1, OPG, and
OPN was available for STEMI patients.
Discussion
Mature elastic fibers consist of elastin and additional ECM
proteins that aid in assembly and link the fibers to the surface of
surrounding cells [33–35]. MFAP4 is an ECM protein that is
thought to play a role in elastin fiber formation and MFAP4 has
been associated with ECM remodeling processes during vascular
injury [12,17,36]. However, localization of MFAP4 in human
tissues has been characterized in a limited number of published
studies [8,12,37,38], and given the paucity of publications on
human MFAP4, we sought to characterize this in further detail.
Furthermore, we included a cohort with different degrees of
atherosclerotic CVD to investigate whether MFAP4 may be
released and detected in the circulation during CVD events.
To investigate the MFAP4 gene expression profile, MFAP4
mRNA transcripts were investigated in 15 human tissues by
qPCR. MFAP4 mRNA transcripts were highly expressed in the
heart, lung, and intestine. These findings are in agreement with a
previous study using Northern blotting [6]. Weak expression was
found in the trachea, liver, salivary gland, and prostate. In the
thymus and brain, no MFAP4 staining was observed, which is in
agreement with another study [6]. However, mRNA expression
may not directly correlate to protein expression as not all mRNA
transcripts are translated into protein. Therefore, immunohistochemistry was included to localize the MFAP4 protein in human
tissues. When using the monoclonal anti-MFAP4 (HG-HYB 7–14)
antibody, MFAP4 protein was visualized at sites rich in elastic
fibers, as observed in the heart, lung, skin, adrenal gland, spleen,
kidney, liver, testis, prostate, and uterus. MFAP4 staining was
further visualized within blood vessels in all tissues investigated.
We have previously shown that human MFAP4 is localized to the
alveolar wall and to elastic fibers in pulmonary arteries using
another monoclonal anti-MFAP4 antibody showing the same
localization pattern as the MFAP4 antibody used in the present
study [8]. MFAP4 expression has further been localized to the skin
[12,39], which is in agreement with our findings. Moreover,
molecular biology techniques such as electron microscopy and
Western blotting have demonstrated that the bovine MAGP-36
protein was accumulated in rat tissues such as the aorta, skin,
kidney, spleen, and lung [9,11,13]. In the liver, MFAP4 staining
has previously been shown in the walls of blood vessels in portal
areas, which is in accordance with our finding. Thus, in
histological cirrhotic liver sections, MFAP4 showed intense
staining patterns, suggesting that hepatic stellate cells induce
MFAP4 synthesis during liver injury [19].
Since MFAP4 was located within blood vessels in almost every
tissue investigated, we aimed to verify whether MFAP4 synthesis in
the heart was produced by VSMCs or cardiomyocytes. To address
this issue, we included in vitro studies to clarify whether human
VSMCs and/or human cardiomyocytes were able to synthesize
MFAP4. Both qPCR analysis and Western blotting revealed that
MFAP4 synthesis was mainly derived from VSMCs.
The role of MFAP4 in cardiovascular diseases is still unknown,
and therefore we studied serum MFAP4 in a clinical cohort to
establish a link between serum MFAP4 levels and different stages
of atherosclerotic CVD. Lower serum MFAP4 levels were
observed in patients with stable atherosclerotic disease compared
with CAC-negative individuals. Furthermore, the range of serum
MFAP4 levels of CAC-positive patients was between the serum
ranges of patients with stable atherosclerotic disease and CACnegative patients. This finding suggests that MFAP4 synthesis from
VSMCs within calcified blood vessels is differently regulated based
on the severity of the atherosclerotic state. Vascular calcification of
blood vessels occurs in the intima or/and the medial layer [40].
MFAP4 and Cardiovascular Diseases
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 9 December 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 12 | e82243

Calcification in coronary arteries occurs mainly within the intima,
and it was recently demonstrated by proteome analysis that
MFAP4 was downregulated in biopsies from atherosclerotic
coronary intima compared with nonatherosclerotic intima [36].
Because we observed lower amounts of serum MFAP4 in patients
with stable atherosclerotic disease relative to CAC-positive
patients, we can speculate that the calcification in the more
severely diseased patient group is located both in the intima and in
the media and interferes with MFAP4 synthesis in both layers of
the vessel wall whereas calcification in coronary arteries mainly is
located within the intima layer suggesting that MFAP4 synthesis
may still be released from VSMCs in the media layer into the
circulation. Another explanation for the depressed serum MFAP4
levels may be that elastase activity increases proportionally to the
extent of atherosclerotic changes, thereby decreasing the elastin
content in atherosclerotic blood vessels [41,42], which may affect
MFAP4 synthesis negatively as a result of the inadequate binding
properties of MFAP4 to elastin in the ECM.
We observed increased serum MFAP4 levels in STEMI and
non-STEMI patients relative to patients with stable atherosclerotic
disease. We assume that CAC is present in STEMI and nonSTEMI patients; however, compared with CAC-negative patients,
MFAP4 levels increase to the same or greater levels. However,
because MFAP4 is a matricellular protein, we investigated whether
MFAP4 was upregulated in cardiomyocytes during myocardial
necrosis, as previously described for the matricellular proteins
OPN and OPG [25,30–32]. Paraffin-embedded sections from
AMI patients revealed that MFAP4 did not appear to be
upregulated in cardiomyocytes during myocardial necrosis.
Therefore, we suggest that the increased MFAP4 levels observed
is released from the blood vessel wall into the circulation during
myocardial ischemia, leveling out the serum MFAP4 depression in
atherosclerotic patients.
In the present study, serum MFAP4 levels correlate with fibulin1 in non-STEMI patients and patients with stable atherosclerotic
disease. Fibulin-1 is expressed in elastin-containing fibers and is
found in the heart and in atherosclerotic lesions [28,43,44]. A
stronger and positive association was further observed between
MFAP4 and OPG in non-STEMI patients and in patients with
stable atherosclerotic disease. OPG is involved in atherogenesis
and vascular calcification and is expressed in cardiomyocytes after
AMI [25,30,31]. Moreover, serum MFAP4 levels correlated
strongly with OPN in non-STEMI patients. OPN is an ECM
protein and plays a role in the healing process after AMI [32]. The
data indicate that serum MFAP4 correlates with other cardiovascular risk markers, suggesting that MFAP4 may further expand the
list of clinically assessed measures of ECM turnover. Fibulin,
OPG, and OPN were not measured in the STEMI group.
It has previously been demonstrated that MFAP4 may serve as a
biomarker for liver cirrhosis, where MFAP4 serum concentrations
increase significantly with the progression of fibrosis development
[19]. In fibrotic conditions, cell insensitivity to normal regulatory
signals leads to excessive ECM deposition, and we can therefore
only speculate that MFAP4 synthesis or ECM turnover is
regulated differently in different organs or diseases, as MFAP4
levels were decreased in patients with stable atherosclerotic disease
who were expected to have significant cardiovascular fibrosis.
The present findings must be interpreted in the context of
several limitations. First, the sample size is small, and additional
investigations with larger cohorts of healthy individuals and
patients are needed to extensively evaluate MFAP4 as a potential
biomarker in comparison with other CVD biomarkers. Secondly,
the MFAP4 biomarker information was limited to a single
measurement point, and monitoring heart injury might be
achieved by using information from biomarker values over time.
Third, the data indicate that serum MFAP4 levels could divide
non-STEMI patients into two distinct groups. Non-STEMI
patients represent a more heterogeneous group than STEMI
patients, consisting of relatively more type 2 myocardial infarction
patients, but the majority of the patients are of type 1 myocardial
infarction like STEMI patients. This heterogeneity may possibly
provide an explanation for the apparent distribution of serum
MFAP4 into two distinct groups in the non-STEMI patients and
larger studies with more patients within each category and with
more detailed information about the type of myocardial infarction
are warranted.
Conclusion
In this study, we demonstrated that the MFAP4 protein is
mainly localized to elastin-containing fibers within blood vessels. In
vitro studies verified MFAP4 synthesis from VSMCs. Serum
MFAP4 is decreased in the systemic circulation in stable
atherosclerotic disease patients compared with CAC-negative
individuals and STEMI and non-STEMI patients. Furthermore,
serum MFAP4 can be correlated with known ECM proteins, such
as fibulin-1, OPG, and OPN. MFAP4 is a component of the
vascular ECM, and the data suggest that serum MFAP4 reflects
the severity of the degree of atherosclerosis/calcification meaning
that MFAP4 synthesis from VSMCs might be suppressed when
both the intima and medial layer is calcified. Moreover, alternative
studies of the biomarker MFAP4 should include atherosclerotic
disease as a confounding effect. Although further investigation of
the distribution and function of MFAP4 in atherosclerosis as well
as its relation to the ECM are warranted, this may be addressed in
future studies.
