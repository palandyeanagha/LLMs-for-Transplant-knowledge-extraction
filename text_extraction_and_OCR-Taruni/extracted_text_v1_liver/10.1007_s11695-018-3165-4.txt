Abstract
Introduction Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) causes more rapid and enhanced absorption of alcohol. RYGB patients have
also been reported to use more inpatient care for alcohol-related disease than do patients after other bariatric procedures. The
present study was designed to evaluate alcohol consumption level before and after gastric bypass using a sensitive and specific
alcohol biomarker.
Materials and Methods Two separate consecutive groups of patients and a group of healthy blood donors, as reference group,
were included in the study. Alcohol intake was assessed using the alcohol marker phosphatidylethanol (PEth) at preoperative
baseline and at 1 and 2 years postoperatively. In the first patient group (n = 133), neither surgeon nor patient was informed about
the results of PEth testing. In the second group (n = 214), PEth results above 0.30 μmol/L were considered to indicate excessive
alcohol consumption and led to preoperative alcohol counseling. The groups were followed for 2 and 1 year, respectively.
Results PEth results were significantly lower in both patient groups at baseline as well as postoperatively compared with the
reference group. In both patient groups, there was a significant increase in PEth values at postoperative follow-up compared to
baseline.
Conclusions Several physiological changes postoperatively have to be considered when interpreting PEth results in obese
patients with dramatic weight reductions. According to results for PEth, obese patients treated with bariatric surgery would seem
to have lower alcohol consumption compared with the reference group. Although slightly increasing their PEth values postoperatively, the RYGB patients did not reach the PEth values of the reference group.

Introduction
Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is a commonly performed
bariatric procedure. In the USA alone, more than 50,000
RYGBs are performed each year, i.e., approximately 45% of
all bariatric procedures [1]. RYGB is even more widely used
in the Nordic countries and presently accounts for 82% of all
bariatric surgery in the Scandinavian Obesity Registry,
SOReg, [2]. Gastric bypass leads to profound changes in eating behavior and metabolism, in turn leading to dramatic
weight reduction and often the disappearance of obesityrelated comorbidities [3]. Although these effects lead to increased life expectancy and improved quality of life, the operation has also been reported to have side effects [4, 5].
RYGB has been reported to cause more rapid and enhanced
absorption of alcohol resulting in a faster rise and higher peak
blood alcohol concentrations [6–8]. In a retrospective
population-based cohort study, Östlund et al. found that

gastric bypass patients postoperatively used more inpatient
care for alcohol-related disease compared with patients operated with gastric band or vertical banded gastroplasty [9]. In
another prospective cohort study of RYGB patients, the presence of alcohol use disorders increased in the second postoperative year compared to the year prior to surgery [10].
So far, alcohol consumption in bariatric patients has been
assessed with different questionnaires, e.g., the Alcohol Use
Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) [11]. Since selfreported alcohol consumption can be biased, an alternative approach would be to assess alcohol consumption with a specific
alcohol marker, e.g., phosphatidylethanol (PEth). PEth is a collective term for a group of abnormal phospholipid homologs,
the most prevalent being PEth 16:0/18:1, formed in the membranes of erythrocytes only in the presence of ethanol [12].
Being an alcohol metabolite, the theoretical specificity of
PEth as an alcohol marker is 100% [12]. There is a correlation
between alcohol consumed and PEth value [13, 14]. PEth has a
half-life of approximately 1 week, thus reflecting alcohol consumption during several weeks before sampling [15, 16].
The present study was designed to examine alcohol consumption level in obese patients selected for RYGB and investigate whether gastric bypass induces a change in consumption level as estimated with a specific and sensitive alcohol marker.
Materials and Methods
Patient Selection and Outpatient Routines Patients were seen
preoperatively by a bariatric surgeon and standard anthropometric data were obtained. The indications for gastric bypass
followed the European guidelines on surgery of severe obesity
[17]. Patients were informed at baseline about the pros and
cons of surgery, including the accentuated and protracted effects of alcohol intake. All patients were informed in writing
that a Bstandard battery^ of laboratory tests was to be performed at baseline and at follow-up (FU). Two consecutive
groups of gastric bypass patients were recruited into the study.
Group 1: During 1 year, 133 patients were included and
followed annually for 2 years. The first year of FU was in our
own outpatient unit and the 2-year FU was performed by the
patients´ primary care physician. PEth results but no measured
body weights were available at the 2-year FU.
Group 2: When all patients had been included in group 1, a
second group of patients was recruited and followed for 1 year
(n = 214).
In group 1, PEth testing was included but the results were
blinded to the attending surgeon as well as to the patient. In
group 2, patients were made aware that the test was taken and
of its result. PEth results > 0.30 μmol/L (indicative of excessive alcohol consumption) occurred in only two cases at the
first visit and led to special counseling about alcohol intake.
Patients then had to show, by a second test 3 weeks later, that
they were able to minimize their alcohol intake (which both
patients successfully managed) before being accepted for
operation.
Operative Procedure The surgical procedure has been described in detail previously [18]. In brief, a small gastric pouch
(15 mL) is created, and the jejunum brought up, first as an
Bomega^ loop in an antecolic and antegastric fashion. A
gastrojejunostomy is created using linear stapling, then a
side-to-side enteroanastomosis is likewise stapled, and finally,
the omega loop is transected between the anastomoses.
Routine limb lengths were 150 cm for the alimentary limb
and 60 cm for the bilio-pancreatic limb. The mesenterial openings were closed.
Reference Values A matched group of 323 healthy blood donors of the same age range and from the same catchment area
as that of the study groups was created for comparison. Blood
samples for PEth were collected after informed consent during
the first year of enrolment of patients in group 1. Neither the
blood donors nor the patients knew in advance that blood
sampling for PEth was to be performed upon inclusion in
the study.
PEth Determination Whole blood concentration of PEth 16:0/
18:1 was measured by liquid chromatography tandem-mass
spectrometry, described in detail previously [19]. There is an
agreement between Swedish laboratories on how to report and
interpret a PEth value. Thus, no numerical results are reported
< 0.05 μmol/L and such values are interpreted as low
(moderate) or no consumption, whereas values > 0.30 are
interpreted as corresponding to excessive consumption [19,
20]. Hence, the limit of quantification was set to 0.05 μmol/
L and used as cut off in the present study.
Statistics Data were prospectively stored in a proprietary database. Descriptive statistics and statistical evaluation were
done with SPSS for Windows (version 22, IBM Corp.,
Armonk, NY). Friedman testing was performed for multiple
comparisons. The Wilcoxon signed rank test, Fisher’s exact
test, and the Mann-Whitney U test were used as appropriate
for within and between groups analysis. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.
Results
All operations were performed according to standard protocols. There were no major complications and postoperative
hospital time was 1.1 days. Patient anthropometric and weight
loss data for both groups are shown in Table 1. There were
statistical differences between the groups according to gender,

age, anthropometric, and weight loss data, but not in PEth
results neither at baseline (p = 0.53) nor at 1-year FU (p =
0.41).
PEth Results in Groups 1 and 2 and Reference Group (Table 2
and Fig. 1) In both patient groups, a minority of the patients
had PEth results ≥ 0.05 μmol/L at all blood sampling occasions. In group 1, there was a number of drop-outs at the 2-
year FU (n = 96 at 2-year FU, compared with n = 133 at baseline and n = 131 at 1-year FU); for further details v.i. and
Table 3. Ninety-four patients in group 1 had complete FU,
i.e., PEth results at baseline and at 1- and 2-year FU. In the
reference group of blood donors, 44% had PEth ≥ 0.05 μmol/
L, the same proportion for males and females.
In comparison with the reference group, both patient
groups had a significantly lower proportion of PEth results
≥ 0.05 μmol/L, at baseline (p < 0.000) as well as at 1-year
FU (p < 0.000). Likewise, group 1 had a lower proportion of
PEth values ≥ 0.05 μmol/L compared with the reference group
at the 2-year FU (p = 0.012).
Comparison of PEth Results in Groups 1 and 2 The hypothesis
that RYGB induces higher levels of alcohol intake in susceptible
individuals was further tested by analyzing 1- and 2-year results
stratified by their preoperative baseline values (Table 2). For
group 1, Friedman testing indicated differences within the
PEth values (p < 0.001). Further testing with Wilcoxon signed
rank test showed no significant difference (p = 0.068) between
baseline and 1-year PEth results, but showed significantly higher
PEth results both at the 2-year FU compared with baseline (p =
0.016) and at the 2-year FU compared with the 1-year FU (p =
0.002). Twenty-eight percent of the patients in group 1 dropped

completed the study and those who dropped out at the 2-year

In group 2, the frequency of PEth results ≥ 0.05 μmol/L

Discussion
The obesity epidemic has made RYGB common since bariatric surgery is the only treatment achieving long-term weight
reduction [21]. Considering the large number of patients operated, it is important to address possible drawbacks with the
surgical procedure, e.g., altered alcohol metabolism and increased risk for alcohol use disorders.
Since self-reported alcohol consumption can be unreliable, there is a need for methods that can provide objective
information about patients´ alcohol use [22–24]. PEth is an
alcohol marker with high sensitivity in groups with excessive alcohol consumption (96–100%) [13, 14, 25]. The
clinical sensitivity has been more varied in groups with
low or moderate alcohol consumption, largely due to differences in sensitivity between analytical methods [14, 16,
26, 27]. Hence, it has been reported that PEth can be used
as a marker for low or moderate alcohol consumption using
a method with improved analytical sensitivity [28]. In the
present study, we used PEth as an objective marker of
alcohol consumption level and of potential changes in its
level after RYGB.
There is a correlation between PEth and alcohol consumption level, PEth likely reflecting the exposition to alcohol over
time, i.e., average blood alcohol concentration during several
weeks before sampling [13, 14]. However, in addition to the

amount of alcohol consumed, body mass also influences
blood alcohol concentration as indicated in the Widmark’s
formula [29].Weight loss will lead to a reduction not only in
adipose tissue but also in total body water, which was shown
in a study on six obese women treated with bariatric surgery
[30]. The weight development curves for our two patient
groups show drastic reductions in body weight suggesting
corresponding reductions in total body water as well. PEth
values showed a significant increase between baseline and
1-year FU in group 2. Although not statistically significant
(p = 0.068), a similar tendency between baseline and 1-year
FU was seen in group 1 (Fig. 1). Since ethanol is distributed in
total body water, the same amount of ethanol consumed will
result in higher blood ethanol concentrations postoperatively
and consequently to increased PEth values. The increased
PEth results at 1-year FU can thus be due to the decrease in
total body water and does not necessarily need to be a consequence of increased alcohol consumption. The weight reduction at 1-year FU was more pronounced in group 2 compared
with group 1 (Table 1). This may at least partly explain the
significant increase in PEth values at 1-year FU seen in group
2 but not in group 1.
In group 1, there is a significant increase in PEth results
at 2-year FU, which is in line with King et al., where the
alcohol consumption increased at the 2-year FU according
to AUDIT [10]. Weight data for our 2-year FU are not
available, but other studies show that weight reduction
has ceased already at 1-year FU [4]. The results in group
1 suffer from 28% drop-out rate. The drop-outs had significantly higher PEth results at 1-year FU compared to the
patients with complete FU (Table 3), so it is possible that
the frequency of PEth ≥ 0.05 μmol/L at 2-year FU would
have been higher if more patients had completed the study.
Hence, this may indicate an increase in alcohol consumption between 1 and 2 years postoperatively. Nonetheless,
neither patient group reached the PEth values obtained in
the reference group of healthy blood donors.
It seems reasonable that further changes postoperatively
can contribute to increased blood alcohol concentrations,
resulting in higher PEth despite unaltered alcohol intake.
Gastric emptying of liquid seems to be faster after RYGB
resulting in a faster absorption of alcohol [31]. In two different
studies, RYGB patients were their own controls and were
given the same dose of alcohol pre- and postoperatively.
Increased peak alcohol level and longer time to reach zero
concentration were seen postoperatively compared to preoperatively [7, 8]. Another possible mechanism that can contribute to an increased alcohol exposure is the decreased contact
with gastric mucosa and thereby to the action of gastric alcohol dehydrogenase after RYGB. In a study on patients after
total gastrectomy compared with controls, gastric alcohol dehydrogenase proved to be responsible for a significant part of
the first pass metabolism of alcohol [32].
Almost half of the blood donors in the reference group had
PEth results ≥ 0.05 μmol/L. In the study by Kechagias et al.,
study participants consumed 1 or 2 glasses of wine/day for
3 months. This consumption corresponds to 1.3 or 2.7 alcohol
units/day (one unit = 12 g alcohol) and resulted in a median
PEth concentration of 0.022 μmol/L after 3 months [28].
Moderate alcohol consumption is defined slightly different
in different countries. In the USA, the upper limit for moderate
drinking is one drink (one drink = 14 g alcohol) per day for
women and up to two drinks per day for men, while in
Sweden, the corresponding limits are 9 and 14 units (12 g/
unit) per week [33, 34]. This indicates that a significant proportion of the blood donors in the reference group consumed
more than moderate amounts of alcohol.
It seems plausible that the weight of the blood donors reflects the Bnormal^ weight in the Swedish population. The
prevalence of BMI > 30 is estimated to be 15% in Sweden
[35]. Most likely, there is a difference in body weight and total
body water content between the patients and the reference
group, probably less pronounced at FU as a consequence of
the weight reduction. The proportion of PEth results ≥
0.05 μmol/L is at all time points lower in the patient groups
compared with the reference group (Fig. 1). This must not
necessarily mean that the patient groups have a lower absolute
alcohol intake than the reference group, but rather that their
average blood alcohol concentrations were lower.
There was no significant difference in the proportion of
PEth ≥ 0.05 μmol/L between groups 1 and 2 neither at baseline nor at the 1-year FU. It is not possible to evaluate whether
the preoperative information on PEth in group 2 influenced
the outcome.
There are some shortcomings of the present study such as
the high drop-out rate and missing body weights at 2-year FU
in group 1. Measurement of total body water pre- and postoperatively in the patient groups as well as in the reference group
would have been of interest for the interpretation of PEth
results. Another point of concern is the FU time; long-term
follow-up is advantageous to fully elucidate patterns of alcohol intake after RYGB. However, the fact that we used an
objective marker for assessment of alcohol intake provides
support for the reliability of our results.
Conclusions
Several physiological changes postoperatively have to be considered when interpreting PEth results in obese patients with a
dramatic weight reduction. According to results for PEth,
obese patients treated with bariatric surgery would seem to
have lower alcohol consumption compared with the reference
group of healthy blood donors. Although slightly increasing
their PEth values postoperatively, the RYGB patients did not
reach the PEth values of the reference group.
