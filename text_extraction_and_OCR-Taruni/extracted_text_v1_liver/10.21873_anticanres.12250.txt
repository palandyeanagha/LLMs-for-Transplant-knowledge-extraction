Abstract. Background/Aim: We report the outcomes of
sorafenib therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) in our Department. Patients and Methods: Thirty-eight
patients with unresectable HCC who were administrated
sorafenib from 2009 to 2015 were investigated retrospectively.
Results: The 1-year overall survival rate was 59.3%. The
macroscopic vascular invasion and response rate were
independent prognostic factors of survival. Surgical resection
after sorafenib achieved long-term survival in two cases. Case
1: A patient with locally unresectable HCC showed significant
response induced by sorafenib, which allowed complete
surgical resection. This tumor tested positive for FGF4. Case
2: A patient with a history of hepatectomy for HCC had
multiple distant metastases. Most lesions were reduced in size
after sorafenib therapy and new lesions in the remnant liver
and residual lung metastases were resected. The sorafenibresistant lesions were negative for FGF4. Conclusion:
Sorafenib combined with surgical resection is a feasible option
in advanced HCC patients, if sorafenib has been effective.
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a major health
problem throughout the world, and it accounts for more than
600,000 new cases per year. The well-known risk factors of
HCC are chronic infection with hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C
virus, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, alcohol abuse, cigarette
smoking and intake of aflatoxins. Complete surgical resection
or liver transplantation for HCC is the only chance for a cure;
therefore, down-staging therapy for advanced HCC is essential
for long-term survival. However, no useful systemic therapy
existed before the introduction of sorafenib.
Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor that targets Raf kinase,
vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1, 2, and 3, and
platelet-derived growth factor receptor β. Sorafenib has been
the standard treatment for first-line therapy (1, 2) for
advanced or metastatic HCC in patients with Child-Pugh A
liver function. Recently, several authors have reported that
sorafenib is a viable therapy that can achieve significant
pathological tumor regression and allow complete surgical
resection (3, 4). However, the response rate to sorafenib
therapy is low (between 2% and 3.3%) (1, 2). In 2012, Arao
et al. reported that fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 3/4
amplification was a potentially useful biomarker for sorafenib
responsiveness by comparative genomic hybridization (5).
We present the outcomes of sorafenib treatment in our
department and report the cases of a patient who showed
significant histopathologic response induced by sorafenib
treatment, which allowed complete surgical resection in a
patient with locally unresectable HCC and a patient who
underwent salvage hepatectomy after sorafenib treatment. In
addition, the resected tumor of the first patient and the
primary tumor of the second patient were positive for FGF4
using immunohistochemistry.
Patients and Methods
This study was performed in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration
of the World Medical Association. This retrospective study enrolled
38 patients with advanced HCC treated at Tokushima University
Hospital from 2009 to 2015. Of these, 18 patients who underwent
initial surgical resection with curative intent and 5 patients who
underwent another previous therapy were included in this study.
The 38 patients included 28 men and 10 women, of mean±SE age
63.6±1.9 years (range=33-84 years). The median patient follow-up for
all patients was 13.3 month (range=2.0-98.5 months). Staging was

defined according to the criteria of the Liver Cancer Study Group of
Japan. Fourteen patients diagnosed with stage IVa and the population
of each stage IVb, III and II were 11, 12 and 1, respectively. Any
adverse effects occurred in 20 patients (50%) and hand-foot syndrome
accounted for 64% of adverse effects. In all 38 patients, the mortality
due to the side effects of sorafenib was 0%. In the follow-up
observations, the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST) criteria were used as a radiological assessment tool for
determining the response rate. Serum des-γ-carboxy prothrombin
(DCP) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels were measured before
sorafenib administration as a base line. The DCP and AFP variation
rate (ΔDCP (%) and ΔAFP (%)) were defined as the percentage of
change between the baseline and the 3 months after administration (6).
Informed consent statement. All procedures were in accordance with
the ethical standards of the responsible committee on human
experimentation (institutional and national) and with the Helsinki
Declaration of 1964 and later revision. Informed consent or substitute
for it was obtained from all patients for being included in the study.
Statistical analysis. Univariate analysis of differences between
groups was determined by log-rank tests and multivariate analysis
by chi-squared tests. Survival curves were plotted using the Kaplan–
Meier method and 1-year OS rate was analyzed. Two-sided p-values
<0.05 were considered statistically significant. All statistical
analyses were performed using JMP version 13 statistical software
(SAS, Campus Drive Cary, NC, USA).
Results
Overall survival. Survival curves of the 38 patients were
plotted by the Kaplan–Meier method. The 1-year OS rate
was 59.3% and median overall survival was 13.3 months
(SD 2.48) (Figure 1).
Univariate and multivariate analysis of clinicopathological
features associated with overall survival. Table I shows
univariate analyses of clinicopathological features associated
with OS. The macroscopic vascular invasion (MVI)
(p<0.01), AFP ≥100 ng/ml (p<0.03), ΔAFP (%) ≥42%
(p<0.03), response rate (progressive disease (PD)) (p<0.01)
and surgical intervention after sorafenib administration
(p<0.05) were significantly prognostic of 1-year OS. Table
II shows multivariate analyses of clinicopathological features
associated with OS. MVI (p<0.05) and response rate (PD)
(p<0.03) were independently prognostic of survival in this
patient cohort. Surgical intervention after sorafenib
administration was exclude from multivariate analyses
because of the smallness of population; the following two
cases.
Case 1
Conversion hepatectomy. A 50-year-old male with a history
of hepatitis type B was referred to our hospital because of a
liver tumor. He had never had anti-hepatitis B treatment
including interferon or nucleoside analogues. Serum DCP
was 23,635 mAU/ml and AFP was 2,308 ng/ml. A computed
tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) showed a large HCC, 12 cm in diameter, on the right
anterior segment of the liver. In addition, multiple
intrahepatic metastases were detected in posterior and medial
segment (Figure 2A and B). For a curative resection, an
extended right lobectomy was needed; however, the
estimated remnant liver volume using simulation software
was less than 30%.
Sorafenib was administered orally at a dose of 800 mg
twice daily. One month later, elevation of transaminase
occurred that required discontinuation of treatment. Both
DCP and AFP were dramatically decreased to 577 mAU/ml
and 17 ng/ml, respectively. After resolution of elevated
transaminase, sorafenib was reintroduced at a dose of 400 mg
orally. Two months after starting sorafenib treatment, serum
AFP and DCP levels were within normal range. After 3
months of sorafenib treatment, a CT scan showed that the
tumor size had been reduced dramatically and that it had a

large necrosis area. No intrahepatic metastasis lesions were
detected on a CT scan or MRI (Figure 2C). A right lobectomy
was performed for curative surgical resection.
Macroscopically, the resected specimens showed extensive
necrosis in most parts of the tumor. Histopathologically, the
main tumor showed a pathologic complete response without
any viable cells (Figure 2D). A small stellate nodule with
viable tumor cells, 2 cm in diameter, was found (Figure 2E).
In this nodule, tumor cells were positive for FGF4 (Figure
2F). The patient remained well, without any evidence of
recurrence 4.5 years after surgery.
Case 2
Salvage hepatectomy. A 60-year-old male with a history of
hepatitis type B had HCC in the right liver lobe, and
underwent right lobectomy in 2007. Pathologically, the
tumor was moderately to poorly differentiated HCC with
microscopic portal vein invasion and intrahepatic metastasis,
and it was positive for FGF4. Eighteen months after
hepatectomy, multiple lung metastasis and hilar lymph node
(LN) metastasis occurred (Figure 3A) and the patient
received general chemotherapy. A regimen of gemcitabine
plus low-dose 5-FU/CDDP and Tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil
(TS-1) combined with interferon alpha were administered,
but it was not effective, and sorafenib was started at a dose
of 800 mg, 29 months after hepatectomy. At this point,
serum DCP was 130 mAU/ml and AFP was 8 ng/ml. Three
months later, serum DCP decreased to 40 mAU/ml and a CT
scan showed a reduction in the lung and LN metastases
(Figure 3B). Serum AFP level didn’t change.
The sorafenib dose was reduced to 400 mg/day because
the patient reported having diarrhea, but sorafenib was
administered continuously. Under careful observation, 25
months after starting sorafenib treatment, a CT scan showed
a recurrent tumor in the medial segment (Figure 3C) that was
increasing in size. Other metastatic lesions were controlled,
and medial segmentectomy was performed (Figure 3D).
Pathologically, the recurrent tumor showed moderately to
poorly differentiated HCC that was negative for FGF4
(Figure 3E).
Sorafenib was then re-introduced and continued, but one
lung tumor remained and it was gradually increasing in size
(Figure 3F). The residual lung tumor was resected 40 months
after hepatectomy (Figure 3G), and the patient was diagnosed
with HCC metastasis that was negative for FGF4 (Figure
3H). The patient’s postoperative course was uneventful and
he remained alive 8 years after sorafenib induction.
Discussion
Since sorafenib was approved in Japan, it has been
administered to many patients with advanced HCC, and it
was expected to improve survival and the time to progression
in these patients (1, 2). However, among the advanced HCC
patients treated with sorafenib, a few achieved complete
response (CR) and there are no definitive biomarkers for
predicting effect of sorafenib. A recent study reported that
early AFP response to sorafenib may be useful for predicting
survival in patients with advanced HCC (7). In our study,
serum AFP level at baseline and the percentage of change

between the baseline and the 3 months after administration
(ΔAFP (%)) were significantly prognostic of 1-year OS in
only univariate analyses. Finally, macroscopic vascular
invasion and response rate were independent prognostic
factors of survival in multivariate analyses.
Curtit et al. reported the first case of a patient who achieved
CR with sorafenib therapy before surgical resection (3). To
obtain better outcomes and achieve a cure, complete surgical
resection has been essential in patients with HCC. Reported

Figure 2. Findings of case 1. Axial contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) during the portal phase revealed a lesion with hypervascularity in
the right liver lobe with intrahepatic metastatic lesion (circle) (A). A Gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid-enhanced magnetic
resonance imaging (Gd-EOB-MRI) showed intrahepatic metastatic lesion in medial segment (arrows) (B). After sorafenib therapy, a CT scan showed
significant reduction in the lesion size (C). A curative right hepatic lobectomy was performed and the tumor showed significant pathological response
with necrotic change. Microscopically, there was massive necrosis and no viable cells in the tumor (★). Non-tumor tissue (★) (magnification ×100)
(D). Tissue from the stellate lesion with viable cells showed moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (magnification ×200) (E) and
it was positive for FGF4 (Anti-FGF4 antibody: HPA011209, Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) (magnification ×200) (F).

Figure 3. Findings of case 2. A hilar lymph node (LN) metastasis (arrow head) (A) and multiple lung metastasis (not shown) occurred 18 months
after hepatectomy for HCC. Sorafenib was introduced and a CT scan showed a size reduction in LN metastasis (arrow) 3 months after starting
sorafenib therapy (B). A recurrent tumor in the medial segment (circle) appeared 25 months after starting sorafenib therapy (C). Medial
segmentectomy was performed (D) and it showed moderately to poorly differentiated HCC that was negative for FGF4 (magnification ×200) (E).
A CT showed a residual lung tumor (arrow) (F). Partial lung resection was performed (G) and the resected tumor showed metastatic HCC that

are rare (3, 4, 8-10) (Table III). We reviewed seven cases, and
all of these cases showed long-term recurrence-free survival.
One of the main concerns with sorafenib therapy before
surgical resection is the safety of performing a hepatectomy
because sorafenib, a molecular-targeted drug, can increase
bleeding and thrombosis, and impair liver regeneration (11).
Barbier et al. reported the safety of liver resection for HCC
after sorafenib therapy using a case-matched multicenter
study (12). In this report, the volume of the blood loss, time
of surgery, and incidence of postoperative complications in
the sorafenib group was similar to the control group.
Identifying positive responders to sorafenib is a critical
issue because of the low response rate to sorafenib therapy.
Thus, it is important to define new biomarkers of
responsiveness to aid in patient selection (13). If we can
identify responders and non-responders to sorafenib, we can
avoid unnecessary sorafenib therapy administered to nonresponders. Non-responders need to undergo other therapeutic
options, such as radiation or transarterial chemoembolization,
which has a higher response rate compared with sorafenib.
For FGF4, it has been reported that a comparative genomic
hybridization analysis using one frozen HCC sample from a
sorafenib responder demonstrated that the 11q13 region, a
rare amplicon in HCC including the loci for FGF3 and FGF4,
was highly amplified. Arao et al. validated FGF3/4
amplification using a real-time polymerase chain reactionbased copy number assay with responder or non-responder
tumor tissue. Moreover, a growth inhibitory assay using a
FGF3/4-amplified cancer cell line showed hypersensitivity to
sorafenib, and it was effective against exogenously expressed
FGF4 tumors (5). Therefore, FGF4 may be a novel candidate
biomarker for sorafenib therapy. In both of our 2 patients,
primary HCC was positive for FGF4, but sorafenib-resistant
lesions including intrahepatic recurrence and HCC lung
metastasis were negative for FGF4. In conclusion, this study
showed that macroscopic vascular invasion and response rate
were independent prognostic factors of survival in patients
with advanced HCC treated with sorafenib. A significant
pathological response was observed in patients described in
the current cases and sorafenib therapy before surgical
resection could be a useful therapeutic option for patients
with advanced HCC, especially if they are FGF4-positive.
