Abstract
Introduction Hepatic adenomas (HAs) are benign tumors of the liver, which can be solitary or multiple, and have a definite
risk of malignant degeneration.
Discussion The pathogenesis and natural history of this disease entity were previously unknown. Recent research into the
molecular pathogenesis of this condition has provided evidence for the malignant transformation of some of these adenomas.
In the current article, we discuss the current evidence on the molecular biology underlying malignant transformation of hepatic
adenomas and the implications for the surgical management of this disease.

Introduction
Hepatic adenoma (HA) is a benign neoplasm usually occurring in an otherwise normal liver. There are two entities
described so far. The first condition is solitary adenoma
associated with the use of oral contraceptives or anabolic
steroids, and the second is hepatic adenomatosis, first described by Flejou and colleagues, whereby the patient develops multiple adenomas (usually ten or more).1, 2 Uncomplicated adenomas are usually asymptomatic making their
true prevalence difficult to assess. The two main complications of hepatic adenoma are hemorrhage from rupture and
malignant transformation. The current treatment strategy for
hepatic adenomas is poorly defined. Traditionally, the
treatment for large, solitary hepatic adenomas will be surgical resection.3 However, in patients who have asymptomatic,
small lesion or multifocal disease not amenable to resection,
the treatment strategy is less clear-cut. The controversy that
plagues the “watch-and-see” approach is the risk of malignant transformation, which is hitherto poorly characterized.
The purpose of the current review is to summarize our
current understanding of the molecular biology of hepatic
adenomas in an attempt to address the fundamental question
if hepatic adenomas are premalignant and can transform into
a cancer. This review will provide the background for future
rationalization of the treatment of this disease entity.
Methods
A literature search was performed using PubMed (1960 to
2013) with the keywords “hepatic adenomas,” “liver cell
adenomas,” “pathogenesis,” “etiology,” “malignant transformation,” “treatment,” and/or “surgical treatment.” We focused
on articles addressing the pathogenesis of hepatic adenomas
and the process of malignant transformation. Articles
discussing the etiology and pathogenesis of hepatocellular
carcinoma were excluded. Further, studies reporting case/s
of hepatic adenoma with malignant transformation were identified. The references of identified articles were assessed for
further relevant papers. In Table 1, the clinical cases found to
have malignant transformation of hepatic adenomas were
summarized, with level of evidence provided according to

Epidemiology and Risk Factors for Hepatic Adenomas
HAs are rare tumors which are more common in females, with
an estimated incidence of approximately 1 case per 100,000
women.5 In the past, the incidence of HAs rose following the
introduction of oral contraceptives. It was estimated that the
annual incidence of HA was 3–4 women per 100,000 users of
oral contraceptives.6 However, the potency of oral contraceptives has since been reduced, and accounts for a reduction in the
incidence of HA. Female gender, oral contraceptives, and anabolic steroids are risk factors for development of HA. Interestingly, the development of hepatic adenomatosis (multiple, >10
adenomas), which was previously thought to be a separate
clinical entity, has little correlation with steroid use and has
equal incidence in male and female gender.1 Glycogen storage
diseases, especially Type I (von Gierke) and Type III, are wellknown risk factors for hepatic adenomatosis development.7
Association with Estrogen Therapy
Numerous previous reports have associated young women
on oral contraceptives with a tendency to develop HAs.
More importantly, withdrawal of estrogen therapy has been
associated with regression of the HA, even if when they are
of considerable size.8–11 The roles of estrogen in the development of hepatic adenomas were speculated on the basis of
several clinical observations. Firstly, history of hormone
therapy was confirmed between 55 and 77 % of patients with
hepatic adenomas. Secondly, there is a relatively rare incidence of hepatic adenoma in male patients. Together, this
implicated the potential roles of estrogen and its cognate
receptors in stimulating hepatocyte proliferation and HA
formation. Further, estrogen and progesterone receptors have
been found in HA lesions.12 However, there is variable
expression of estrogen receptors (26–73 %) in hepatic adenomas. As such, it is not surprising some hepatic adenomas
do not regress even with withdrawal of hormone therapy.
Association with Glycogen Storage Disease
Glycogen storage diseases (GSD) are inherited autosomal
recessive disorders characterized by intracellular accumulation of glycogen. Type I GSD (von Gierke’s disease) is the
most common form, and results from defects in glucose-6-
phosphatase system. Type III GSD on the other hand is due
to deficiency of glycogen-debranching enzyme. Both diseases result in impaired glycogenolysis and excessive glycogen accumulation in organs, especially in the liver and kidney. Approximately 22–75 % of patients with Type I GSD
develop hepatic adenomas, usually diagnosed by the second
decade of life.7 In Type III GSD, only 4.4–25 % of the
patients develop HAs.13, 14 Further, the estimated risk of
malignant transformation of Type I GSD-related HAs is as
high as 10 %.7 The risk of HCC development is very low in
Type III GSD as to date, there are only six cases of HCC
reported in the literature.13 The biological consequence of
excessive glycogen storage seems to induce carcinogenesis
in liver. This is supported by animal studies using a rat model
by Bannasch and colleagues who showed the concept that
glycogenosis is an early event in liver cells during hepatic
carcinogenesis induced by N-nitrosomorpholine.15, 16 This is
accompanied by distinct changes in expression of carbohydrate metabolizing enzymes in rat liver. As such, hepatic
glycogenosis may be causally related with hepatic
adenoma-carcinoma progression in Type I GSD patients,
but the exact mechanism is uncertain.
Pathology of Hepatic Adenomas
Classically, hepatic adenoma is characterized by histological
appearance of monotonous sheets of hepatocytes, in the
absence of biliary components, fibrosis, or dysplasia. It has
been described that hepatic adenomas are consisted of monoclonal cells, whilst focal nodular hyperplasia consists of
polyclonal cells.17 In general, HAs which develop in patients
following exogenous hormonal therapy (e.g., oral contraceptives) are large, single, and encapsulated, whilst those associated with GSD are small, multiple, and unencapsulated.18
It is important to note that well-differentiated hepatocellular
carcinoma can mimic the appearance of hepatic adenoma.
Adenoma-Carcinoma Sequence of Hepatic Adenomas
There have been multiple reports of malignant change in
HAs. Detailed pathological analysis of sections of the adenomas with malignant transformation has revealed that the
cancerous lesions occur within regions of otherwise typical
adenoma.19 As such, these cancerous changes are not coincidental occurrence of synchronous lesions within the liver.
To support this, recent molecular analysis of the hepatic
adenomas revealed the same nucleotide mutation of βcatenin in the adenoma and HCC part the adenoma, indicating that the malignant transformation evolved from the original benign adenoma and suggesting the same clonal origin
for the lesions.20 This conclusion has recently been replicated by Michelli and colleagues who found that hepatocellular
carcinomas were found directly within hepatic adenomas,
implicating a process of degeneration into malignancy.21
At least in cases of oral contraceptive-associated hepatic
adenoma, the prolonged use of contraceptive may lead to
1872 J Gastrointest Surg (2013) 17:1869–1882

dysplastic changes within hepatic adenomas that may eventually progress into hepatocellular carcinoma.19, 22 The key
finding that supports the adenoma-carcinoma sequence in
hepatic adenoma is the discovery of foci of dysplasia within
adenomas.19 Although this remains controversial, it is
thought that the development of dysplasia within a hepatic
adenoma commits the adenoma towards an irreversible process of malignant degeneration. As such, the development of
dysplastic changes within a hepatic adenoma can be likened
to the phenomenon of carcinoma-in-situ in the natural history of other epithelial cancers.23, 24 Although the development
of liver cell dysplasia is commonly associated with cirrhotic
livers, it can develop in other liver conditions, such as HAs.
This hypothesis explains the cases whereby the hepatic adenomas regress initially following withdrawal of hormonal
therapy; however, HCC develops subsequently. A plausible
explanation is that hepatic adenoma is a disease entity that is
reversible, which accounts for the shrinkage of adenomas
following withdrawal of growth stimulus such as hormonal
therapy. If however there is development of dysplasia within
the adenoma, this entity will persist and eventually develops
into a cancer, accounting for the malignant recurrence at the
site of hepatic adenomas.
In hepatic adenomatosis, there has been description of
malignant degeneration as well. In 2000, Chiche and colleagues reported on their eight cases of hepatic adenomatosis
and reviewed all previous cases of adenomatosis.25 Given
the small series, there was a single case of malignant transformation within this group. In cases of Type I GSD, HCC
develops in the context of hepatic adenomatosis, and the
mechanism of this is believed to be adenoma-carcinoma
progression.26, 27 On the other hand, Type III GSD is associated with liver cirrhosis and HCC develops against this
background of cirrhosis (cirrhosis-carcinoma sequence),
rather than from adenomas13 (Fig. 1).
Cells of Origin of Hepatic Adenomas
Recently, there has been a paradigm shift in that cancer is
increasingly thought to arise from a subgroup of cells known
as the “cancer stem cells.” The cancer stem cell theory states
that the transformed stem cells retain their renewal capacity
and continuously proliferate and differentiate to recapitulate
the tumor.28 It is plausible that hepatic adenomas can arise
from hepatic stem cells or committed progenitor cells.
Whether hepatic adenomas and hepatocellular carcinomas
develop from the same stem cells remain to be elucidated.
Hepatic progenitor cells may have a role in development of
hepatic tumors. Interestingly, it was found that hepatic progenitor cells and intermediate hepatocyte-like cells were
discovered in 50 % of dysplastic hepatic foci and hepatic
adenomas.29 This suggests that at least in some instances,
HAs can arise from hepatic progenitor cells, which when
transformed can give rise to dysplastic foci and ultimately,
hepatocellular carcinomas.30 This further implies that HA
and HCC can have a common cell of origin and that some of
the HAs may be precursor lesions for HCC (Figs. 2 and 3).
Risk of Malignant Transformation of Hepatic Adenomas
The risk of malignant transformation of hepatic adenomas is
largely unknown. In a multicentre analysis of five academic
hepato-pancreato-biliary units in North America, 5 out of a
series of 124 patients (over a 10-year study epoch) with
hepatic adenoma had underlying malignancy proven pathologically following liver resection.31 Of note, in cases of
hepatic adenomas whereby the primary lesion has regressed
following withdrawal of hormone therapy, there is still a risk
of malignant progression, given that there has been cases of
late development of hepatocellular carcinomas several years
after adenoma regression. The overall frequency of malignant
transformation of HA has recently been estimated to be 4.2 %
in a systematic review including 1,600 cases of HA.32 The
high-risk categories include patients with GSD Type I, ongoing use of steroid, and male gender.33 The characteristics of
described cases of HA with malignant progression are provided in Table 1 and Supplemental Online Table.
Genotype–Phenotype Classification of Hepatic
Adenomas
The French collaborative network has devised a system of
classifying hepatic adenomas based on a combination of genetic aberrations and histological appearance.20 They showed
a strong genotype–phenotype correlation in a series of 96
analyzed cases. Hepatic adenomas can be classified into four
main categories: (1) HNF1α inactivation, with phenotypic
features of marked steatosis, lack of cytological atypia, and
absence of inflammatory infiltrates (40–45 %), (2) β-catenin
activation, with atypical features such as pseudoglandular
formation (15–19 %), (3) inflammatory group with presence
of acute inflammatory infiltrate (30–35 %), and (4) nonmutated HNF1α and β-catenin (unclassified) group without
inflammatory infiltrate. Of note, Zucman-Rossi and colleagues have observed that no case of HAs appear to have
both mutations in HNF1α and activation of β-catenin,
suggesting that the two pathways may be mutually exclusive.
More importantly, it was found that lesions with β-catenin
activation have a higher risk of malignant transformation,
compared to other subtypes.20 Inflammatory subtype of HA
is predominantly found in female patients and frequently
associated with alcohol use and obesity.20, 34 Importantly, a
subgroup of inflammatory HAs can harbor β-catenin mutation and consequently have an increased malignant risk.35
J Gastrointest Surg (2013) 17:1869–1882 1873

From a biological standpoint, impaired fatty acid shuttling
and metabolism lead to the histological phenomenon of
steatosis associated with HAs.36 Mechanistically, the
HNF1α gene controls fatty acid trafficking through its effect
on the L-FABP (liver fatty acid binding protein). Hence,
inactivation of HNF1α will result in impaired fatty acid
transport, fat accumulation, and increased lipogenesis, contributing to the steatotic phenotype seen in HNF1αinactivated HAs.36 Given that HAs with HNF1α inactivation
are at a low risk of malignant transformation, Van der Borght

Apart from the cirrhosisassociated hepatocellular
carcinoma development, it is now
thought that there is the existence
of the adenoma-carcinoma
sequence, likened to the
phenomenon of carcinoma-in-situ
in the natural history of other
epithelial cancers. It is plausible
that hepatic adenoma is a disease
entity that is reversible, which
accounts for the shrinkage of
adenomas following withdrawal
of growth stimulus such as
hormonal therapy. However, the

and colleagues have suggested the use of histological
steatosis as a surrogate marker for HNF1α inactivation and
hence, identifying a subgroup of HAs with a lower risk of
malignant transformation.37
Recently, Bioulac-Sage and colleagues showed the feasibility of using a number of immunohistochemical markers to
help classify HAs according to the described classification
system, with potentials for routine clinical practice.34 For
routine clinical use, the detection of genetic mutations will
need to be easily performed and the most common method
widely available in pathology laboratory will be standard
immunohistochemistry. Bioulac et al. developed several surrogate immunohistochemical markers to help classify the
HAs. Absent L-FABP (a downstream molecular target of
HNF1α) staining on tumor slides was used to identify HAs
with HNF1α inactivation and β-catenin activation is indicated by nuclear accumulation of β-catenin staining in HAs.
More recently, Laumonier and colleagues attempted to use
magnetic resonance imaging as a non-invasive means of identifying subtypes of HAs. They found that it was possible to
identify HNF1α-mutated and inflammatory HAs as these
lesions demonstrated characteristic features on MRI imaging.
This was clearly useful as these two subtypes form 80 % of all
HAs. As such, this adds a further dimension to our ability to
classify or subtype HAs, which now consists of clinical,
genotype, histological/immunohistochemical, and radiological features (Table 2). The characterization of subtypes of HAs
based on the immunohistochemical profile of these genetic
aberrations has been reproduced by several groups
worldwide.35
This genotype–phenotype classification may help in identifying high-risk patients who may benefit from aggressive
therapy, whilst HAs with low risk of malignant transformation may be conservatively managed. However, given that
much of the current data are based on retrospective analysis,
a prospective validation study should be conducted to assess
the utility and safety of the genotype–phenotype classification system to allow development of clinical guidelines. The
above work has set the stage for further elucidation of genetic aberrations in HAs, which we will discuss in subsequent sections.
Genetic Aberrations in Hepatic Adenomas
From the clinical perspective, the solitary HAs were once
thought to be a different disease entity from hepatic
adenomatosis (multiple HAs). However, it is now increasingly

clear that the genetic basis of both conditions does not differ
and their genetic mutation spectrum is largely similar.20
There is convincing evidence to suggest that HA is a genetic
disease, and in particular, there is a genetic basis to its risk of
malignant degeneration.
Chromosomal Aberrations in Hepatic Adenomas
Cytogenetic analysis of HAs using fluorescence in situ
hybridization and comparative genomic hybridization has
found occasional gains on 7p, 17q, 20p, and 20q and rarely,
deletion of 8p.38
, 39 In comparison to hepatocellular carcinoma, HAs have lesser degree of chromosomal aberrations,
which supports the hypothesis that the spectrum from HA to
malignancy involves a cumulative genetic aberrations. 39
, 40
More specifically, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II receptor
(M6P/IGFRII) has been found in both HA and HCC.41
Competent M6P/IGFRII signaling is required for the activation of transforming growth factor β (a tumor suppressor
gene). Similarly, LOH in DNA mismatch repair gene, human MutL homologue-1 (hMLH1) was also identified in
both HA and HCC.42 These findings suggest that allelic loss
in HA may be an early event in the progression to HCC.
TCF1/HNF1α
The genetic basis of hepatic adenomas comes from the
seminal work by Bluteau et al. that the most common
genetic aberration seen in hepatic adenoma is a mutation
that inactivates the TCF1 gene.43 The TCF1 gene encodes
for the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α (HNF1α). Biallelic
inactivation of TCF1 gene is found in 35–50 % of hepatic
adenomas.20
, 34, 43 In these cases, the majority of them
(84 %) has somatic mutations in both alleles, and the
remaining cases have one of the TCF1 mutations being a
germline mutation.44 The families with heterozygous germline inactivation of TCF1 gene will display the
adenomatosis phenotype, in which individuals develop more that ten adenomas when they lose the heterozygosity for
TCF1 gene.45 This observation is of crucial importance in
that it describes the underlying genetic basis of hepatic
adenomatosis, which may conform to the classic Knudson’s
two-hit hypothesis. In short, it is probable that patients with
germline mutation of TCF1 are predisposed to development
of hepatic adenomatosis, given that the hepatocytes would
only require one further mutation (i.e.,“second hit”) to form
an adenoma in the liver. This permissive condition probably
led to the formation of multiple adenomas (hepatic
adenomatosis). More importantly, this observation suggests
that individuals with hepatic adenomatosis probably have a
germline mutation in a gene that predispose to hepatic

will develop adenomatosis, indicating that germ line TCF1 mutation has an incomplete penetrance.45, 46 In short, the TCF1 gene
is an early tumor suppressor gene that becomes inactivated
during the development of hepatic adenoma. Of note, HAs with
HNF1A mutations tend to be indolent and do not progress.
Cosegregation of diabetes and hepatic adenomas in a
large family was previously described.47 More recently, heterozygous germline mutations in the TCF1 gene have been
found to be present in patients with the maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 3 (MODY3).48 In the study by
Bluteau et al., one of the patients in the study series have a
germline mutation in TCF1 gene.43 This individual had
clinical features suggestive of MODY3, and more interestingly, the patient had a family history of both diabetes and
hepatic adenomatosis. The previously described association
between hepatic adenomas and diabetes, specifically
MODY3, can now be attributed to germline mutations in
TCF1 gene, providing a genetic explanation for this
association.
β-catenin/Wnt Signaling Pathway
The CTNNB1 gene encodes for β-catenin which is a key
molecule in the Wnt signaling pathway. When β-catenin
translocates into the nucleus, it can activate the transcription
of a range of genes involved in hepatocyte physiology including cell proliferation, stem cell renewal, lineage specification,
epithelial–mesenchymal transition, and cell adhesion.49, 50 In
normal hepatocytes, the levels of β-catenin are controlled by
its degradation following phosphorylation by GSK-3β of its
“degradation domain” (serine/threonine phosphorylation site).
However, mutations in the CTNNB1gene at the “degradation
domains” lead to protein stabilization, and the mutant βcatenin resists degradation leading to its nuclear accumulation.
Nuclear accumulation will lead to persistent activation of the
β-catenin pathway which results in autonomous growth of
hepatocytes. Mutations in β-catenin gene are present in 15–
30 % of HAs.20, 51 Torbenson et al. found evidence of nuclear
accumulation of β-catenin in some HAs, indicating activation
of the Wnt signaling pathway.12 Importantly, HAs with βcatenin mutations seem to have a tendency to progress to
HCC. This corroborates with the findings that β-catenin activation is a frequent (20–34 % of cases) event in HCCs.52–55
As such, the CTNNB1 gene may represent an oncogene in the
natural history of progression from HA to HCC. HAs with βcatenin mutation are more likely to progress to HCC (up to
50 %), making β-catenin activation as a surrogate high-risk
marker for HCC progression.20
Interleukin-6–Gp130 Signaling Pathway
Inflammatory features have been previously observed in a
subgroup of HAs.20 This prompted Rebouissou et al. to
screen HAs by genome-wide transcriptome analysis to identify inflammatory genes that may have role in the pathogenesis of this subtype of HAs.56 In a group of inflammatory
HAs, activating mutations were found in interleukin-6 signal
transducer (IL6ST) gene which encodes for the cell surface
co-receptor, gp130 protein. Under normal physiological conditions, interleukin-6 (IL-6) binds to its cognate IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) which forms a hexameric complex consisting of
wo molecules each of IL-6, IL-6R, and gp130. This hexameric
complex will activate STAT3 transcriptional factor and its
downstream targets. These IL6ST mutations found in inflammatory HAs resulted in constitutive activation of gp130 proteins which activate STAT3 and inflammatory response genes
downstream, even in the absence of IL6. Interestingly, it was
found that in a small group of HCCs with inflammatory
features, there was evidence that gp130 mutations are accompanied by β-catenin-activating mutations, implying a possible
cooperative effect of these signaling pathways in the malignant transformation of hepatocytes.56
APC/Familial Polyposis Coli
The APC protein functions as a component of the degradation
complex together with Axin and GSK-3β to control the levels
of β-catenin in the cell. If there is biallelic loss/mutation of
APC gene, this will prevent degradation of β-catenin and
hence, allow nuclear accumulation of β-catenin and its downstream activation. Three cases of HA have been previously
described in FAP patients.5, 57, 58 In two of the cases, biallelic
inactivation of APC gene leading to the activation of βcatenin was thought to be the driving mechanism for HA
formation.57, 58 In the remaining case, the β-catenin pathway
was not activated as there was only monoallelic inactivation of
APC in that patient. However, it was found that the HA from
this patient displayed biallelic inactivation of the HNF1α
gene. Hence, both the APC/β-catenin/Wnt and HNF1α signaling pathways can promote HA formation in FAP patients.
p16INK4a and p14ARF Alterations
The INK4a-ARF (CDKN2A) locus on chromosome 9p21
encodes for two tumor suppressor proteins, p16INK4a and
p14ARF, through distinct first exons and alternative reading
frames of shared downstream exons. They are often
inactivated in human cancers, including HCC. p16INK4a inhibits CDK4/6-mediated phosphorylation of retinoblastoma
protein, thereby blocking entry into the S-phase of cell cycle.
Given that p14ARF stabilizes p53 by inhibiting its MDM2-
mediated proteasomal degradation, loss of p14ARF will lead
to degradation of tumor suppressor p53 and hence, promotes
tumorigenesis. Tannapfel and colleagues found that HAs
showed evidence of epigenetic silencing through hypermethylation of p16INK4a and p14ARF gene promoters, in 12 and
J Gastrointest Surg (2013) 17:1869–1882 1877

24 % of the cases, respectively.59 Inactivation of these genes
will lead to induction of cell cycle progression and proliferation in HAs, contributing a potential malignant degeneration.
Sex Steroid Receptors and Sex Steroid Metabolism Pathway
The development of HAs has been closely linked to past or
current exposure to hormonal therapy. Jeannot et al. studied
the genes involved in estrogen metabolism in hepatic adenomas and found that CYP1B1 germline heterozygous mutations
are found in women with HNF1α-mutated adenomas.44 It is
likely that the inactivating mutations in CYP1B1 can act
synergistically with TCF1 mutations to increase the incidence
of HAs. The CYP1B1 protein is responsible for hormone
metabolism, and the inactivation of this protein through mutation can result in accumulation of estrogen metabolite that
may have genotoxic effects, though the exact mechanism that
predisposes to HA formation remains unknown.
MicroRNAs
MicroRNAs (miRNA) are short, endogenous, non-coding
RNAs which can post-transcriptionally regulate expression
of specific genes. The primary modes of action are by promoting degradation of specific mRNAs and hence, suppressing gene expression, as well as binding to 3′-untranslated
region of the targeted mRNA to prevent translation. Ladiero
et al. recently profiled the miRNA expression of hepatic
adenomas.60 They found that HAs upregulate miR-224 in a
similar fashion as HCCs. Furthermore, miR-122a was found
to be downregulated in both HAs and HCCs. More importantly, they demonstrated using a cell line model that functionally
HNF1α is capable of directly regulating the miR-107 expression. Further, based on their profiling data, they speculated
that β-catenin activation can downregulate the miR-375 levels
in HAs. Further work will need to be performed to clarify the
roles of microRNAs in the pathogenesis of hepatic adenomas.
Experimental Models of Hepatic Adenomas
The MET gene encodes the receptor tyrosine kinase, Met. In
an elegant study by Tward and colleagues, they showed that
transgenic mice overexpressing the MET proto-oncogene developed both HA and HCC.61 However, it was observed that
HCC did not develop within HAs. Using hydrodynamic
transfection of transgenes, Tward and colleagues found that
MET overexpression when combined with HNF1α inactivation leads to HAs in 50 % of the mice. On the other hand,
overexpression of MET supplemented with β-catenin activation led to these mice developing HCC in 74 % of surviving
mice. More interestingly, if the MET+/β-catenin + mice subsequently have MET downregulated, β-catenin activation
alone is able to result in recurrent HCC. These experiments
suggest that with the background of MET overexpression,
HNF1α inactivation or β-catenin activation can induce HA or
HCC, respectively. It is important to note that in the context of the
MET transgenic mice, the genetic background is one that is
artificial and constricted compared to the genetic diversity found
in human HAs and indeed, HCC. Corroborating evidence from
other groups showed that HNF1α knockout mice develops liver
enlargement and hepatic dysfunction,62, 63 whilst in rat models of
carcinogenesis, there is a decrease in HNF1α expression in
preneoplastic liver nodules, implying the tumor suppressor roles
of HNF1α in cellular growth of liver nodules.64
Management of Hepatic Adenomas
We have summarized the evidence, from both clinical and
biological studies, that HAs are due to genetic aberrations
and a subset of HAs are precursor lesions for HCC. However, it appears that HAs can take varying durations of time to
progress to malignancy, and in some cases, progression can
be very slow or rapid. The onus is now on the research that
aims to risk-stratify these lesions into groups with low and
high risk of malignant degeneration. This will facilitate development of strategies to follow-up and treat patients with
HA. Zucman-Rossi and colleagues have recently suggested a
clinical algorithm for the diagnosis and treatment of HAs,
based on the genotype–phenotype classification system.35
Of note, this algorithm has not been validated prospectively,
in particular with regard to sensitivity and specificity for
detecting malignant change within HAs. In the absence of
this evidence, the optimal management of HAs remains
controversial. Any decision regarding the selection of conservative versus surgical approach will depend on the clinical context. However, the molecular analyses of HAs have
contributed significantly by providing several molecular
characteristics that predict high risk of malignant change.
Corroborating the previously known clinical features and the
new molecular data, surgical resection of HA is indicated if:
1. Large size of HA (>5 cm) with the impending risk of
rupture or hemorrhage
2. Evidence of β-catenin activation in any HA
3. Any HA in male patients
(The above three features are high risk factors for malignant change in HAs)
4. Evidence of dysplasia or atypia within an adenoma.
5. Clinical features of malignant transformation in HA (i.e.,
increasing size, malignant features on imaging)
Of note, the α-fetoprotein levels are often in the normal
range (see Table 1). As such, this is a poor indicator of
malignant transformation.
1878 J Gastrointest Surg (2013) 17:1869–1882

In cases of solitary HA with the above high-risk factors
whereby resection can be safely performed, surgery should
be offered as it provides a chance of long-term cure. The
rationale for this is that resection prevents future occurrence
of malignancy, as there has not been any report of HCC
recurrence following resection of adenoma. Also, HAs, if
unresected, will have a risk of malignant degeneration with
time, even in cases where the adenoma has regressed. Lastly,
resection also eliminates the risk of observing a lesion that
has been incorrectly diagnosed as benign and will prevent
future complications such as rupture and hemorrhage.
The management of hepatic adenomatosis (multiple HAs)
will require a tailored approach given the lack of robust
clinical data. From the genetic perspective, it is likely that
hepatic adenomatosis have the same genetic mutation underpinning their development as solitary HAs. As such, it has
been suggested that liver resection should be considered
along the same principles as solitary of HAs, i.e., if the
lesions are >5 cm in size or harbors β-catenin activation.35
Of note, there is a higher frequency of malignant transformation (and β-catenin activation) in hepatic adenomatosis
arising in the context of GSD. Liver transplantation is an
option for patients with GSD when the presence of progression to HCC in HA is confirmed, but with no evidence of
metastatic disease.65
Given that biopsy specimen can be inconclusive and
misleading as some lesions of HCC can be surrounded by
HA tissue, and the differentiation of HA from welldifferentiated HCC remains difficult on histopathological
analysis, close follow-up of patients who are treated conservatively should be mandatory. Regular liver imaging with
monitor of alpha-fetoprotein is essential, although alphafetoprotein level is only helpful if it is raised or rising.
Although there are limited data on its use in HA cases, it is
likely that there is a role for radiofrequency ablation in
treatment of hepatic adenomas not amenable to resection.
Further, hepatic arterial chemoembolization has been reported as effective sole therapy in treating multiple hepatic
adenomatosis.66 or in cases of HAs which are not resectable
(i.e., central lesions).67
Future Work
The future of the management of HAs will be a tailored
patient management strategy based on the genotype–phenotype classification of the lesion. Although the genotype–
phenotype classification of HAs represent a significant advance, the clinical applicability of this will need further
validation and clarification, perhaps with a large multicentre
prospective study. Given that most of the reported case series
are surgical series whereby patients have undergone surgical
therapy, there is an inherent bias towards patients who have
larger adenomas, complicated or symptomatic disease,
which prompted surgical attention. As such, our understanding of the natural history of this disease will be skewed
towards the extreme spectrum of the disease. To solve this,
perhaps a registry for hepatic adenoma patients should be set
up, which includes any patient with the diagnosis whether
treated or just being monitored. Long-term cohort study of
such patients taking into account the genetic subtype of the
HA will allow elucidation of the natural history of these
lesions. This will clearly require a multicentre collaboration
given the rarity of HAs. It is possible that further work will
reveal increasing diversity and complexity to the genetic and
biological aspects of the malignant transformation of hepatic
adenomas. From the therapeutic standpoint, given that βcatenin is implicated in HAs with higher risk of malignant
degeneration, perhaps development of β-catenin inhibitors
will be a useful adjunct to our treatment strategy. For instance, β-catenin activated HAs can be treated with such
inhibitor, as a prophylactic measure to prevent malignant
transformation.68
Conclusions
Hepatic adenoma is probably a heterogenous group of disease at the molecular level. More importantly, it is now a
disease with a genetic basis. The specific genetic signature
that predisposes to its malignant progression is just being
unraveled. From the clinical standpoint, it will be crucial for
clinicians to define this signature in order to cater our treatment strategy to the risk of malignancy.
