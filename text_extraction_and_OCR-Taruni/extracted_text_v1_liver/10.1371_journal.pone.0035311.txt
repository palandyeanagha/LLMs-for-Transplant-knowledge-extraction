Abstract
Background: Candida albicans is a human commensal that is also responsible for chronic gastritis and peptic ulcerous
disease. Little is known about the genetic profiles of the C. albicans strains in the digestive tract of dyspeptic patients. The
aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence, diversity, and genetic profiles among C. albicans isolates recovered from
natural colonization of the digestive tract in the dyspeptic patients.
Methods and Findings: Oral swab samples (n = 111) and gastric mucosa samples (n = 102) were obtained from a group of
patients who presented dyspeptic symptoms or ulcer complaints. Oral swab samples (n = 162) were also obtained from
healthy volunteers. C. albicans isolates were characterized and analyzed by multilocus sequence typing. The prevalence of
Candida spp. in the oral samples was not significantly different between the dyspeptic group and the healthy group (36.0%,
40/111 vs. 29.6%, 48/162; P . 0.05). However, there were significant differences between the groups in the distribution of
species isolated and the genotypes of the C. albicans isolates. C. albicans was isolated from 97.8% of the Candida-positive
subjects in the dyspeptic group, but from only 56.3% in the healthy group (P , 0.001). DST1593 was the dominant C.
albicans genotype from the digestive tract of the dyspeptic group (60%, 27/45), but not the healthy group (14.8%, 4/27) (P
, 0.001).
Conclusions: Our data suggest a possible link between particular C. albicans strain genotypes and the host
microenvironment. Positivity for particular C. albicans genotypes could signify susceptibility to dyspepsia.

Introduction
Candida is considered part of the normal human flora, but
recently, much attention has been given to the role of Candida in
chronic gastritis and ulcerous disease. Candida albicans (C. albicans)
colonization of the gastric mucosa was shown to be present in 30–
50% of patients with active ulcerous disease [1–5]. The presence
of C. albicans prolongs the persistency of clinical symptoms and
affects the processes of ulcer healing [6–8].
C. albicans can invade epithelial cells by induced endocytosis
and/or active penetration. The routes of adhesion, invasion, and
damage by C. albicans depend not only on fungal morphology and
activity, but also on the epithelial cell type and the differentiation
stage of the epithelial cells, indicating that epithelial cells differ in
their susceptibility to the fungus. The ability of Candida to invade
different environments in the host organism is a result of the great
flexibility and adaptability of fungi [9–15]. The isolation and
identification of C. albicans strains involved in lesions of the gastric
mucosa would contribute to an understanding of the relationship
between C. albicans and inflammatory gastrointestinal barrier
disorders.
Molecular epidemiology studies have shown that C. albicans
isolates exhibit a high level of genetic diversity. Multilocus
sequence typing (MLST) has been used to discriminate C. albicans
strains and to detect small genetic changes or microvariations that
may be indicative of adaptability processes [16–41]. MLST of C.
albicans is a highly discriminatory method based on the analysis of
nucleotide polymorphisms within the sequences of seven PCRgenerated 400- to 500-bp internal fragments of housekeeping
genes (the loci). For each locus, the different sequences are
assigned to distinct genotypes (represented by integers), and for
each isolate, the combination of the genotypes at each of the
sequenced loci defines a profile referred to as the diploid sequence
type (DST). Because MLST relies only on nucleotide sequencing,
it generates highly standardized data that can be exchanged
through a web-based database (http://calbicans.mlst.net).
Genetic profiles of the C. albicans strains in the digestive tract of
dyspeptic patients have not been investigated before. In the
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 April 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 4 | e35311

present work, we assessed isolates of C. albicans from the gastric and
oral mucosa by MLST, to ascertain whether particular strains are
related to pathological lesions of the human gastric mucosa. Our
results showed that the DST1593 was the dominant genotype in
the digestive tract of dyspeptic patients; this could be used as a sign
of susceptibility to dyspepsia.
Results
Prevalence of Candida in Oral Swab Samples from
Healthy People
The healthy group comprised 162 subjects from 32 families
from Shenyang, China. Forty-eight subjects were colonized by
Candida species. The majority of people (95.8%) were colonized by
only one species. C. albicans was identified in 56.3% of the carriers,
C. parapsilosis was identified in 20.8% of the carriers, C. tropicalis in
10.4%, Meyerozyma guilliermondii in 6.3%, Lodderomyces elongisporus in
4.2%, and other Candida species (including C. metapsilosis,
Issatchenkia orientalis, and C. ethanolica) were identified in 6.3% of
the carriers. C. albicans carriers were identified in 18 families.
Overall, the rate of oral carriage for C. albicans was 16.7%.
Prevalence of Candida in Oral Swabs and Gastric Mucosa
Samples from People with Dyspepsia
The dyspeptic group comprised 111 dyspeptic patients, and the
family control group consisted of one or two family members for
each of 18 patients. Forty-six dyspeptic patients were colonized by
Candida species. The majority of the dyspeptic patients (95.7%)
were colonized by only one species. Twenty-four patients were
colonized at only one of the two sites studied (oral [18 patients]
and gastric mucosa [six patients]), whereas 22 patients were
colonized at both sites. C. albicans was identified in all but one of
the 46 Candida carriers; the other was positive for C. glabrata. C.
parapsilosis was identified in 4.3% of the Candida carriers and C.
glabrata was identified in 2.2% of the Candida carriers. Overall, the
rate of oral and/or gastric carriage for C. albicans was 40.5% in the
dyspeptic group. C. albicans, and no other species, was present in
oral swabs from four of the family control group: three were
patients’ wives and one was a patient’s daughter.
There was a statistically significantly increased prevalence of C.
albicans in oral swabs from the dyspeptic group versus the healthy
group (34.2% vs. 16.7%, respectively; P = 0.001). The prevalence
of Candida spp. in oral swabs was not significantly different between
the two groups (36.0% vs. 29.6%; P . 0.05) (Table 1).
MLST Analysis of the C. albicans Isolates
Taken together, 96 C. albicans samples were isolated: 27 from
gastric mucosa samples of the dyspeptic patients and 69 from oral
swab samples (from 38 patients, 4 patient family members, and 27
healthy volunteers). The samples were grown in dishes and two
clones from each dish were chosen for MLST analysis. All but 11
of the replicates shared the same DST; those that were different
were from two gastric mucosa samples (nos. 8027 and 8066), four
oral swabs from the dyspeptic patients (nos. 8027, 8113, 8203, and
8221), and five oral swabs from the healthy volunteers (nos. 2n,
42a, 157c, 287, and 287g). Details of the Candida prevalence in the
healthy volunteers and the dyspeptic group are presented in
Tables S1 and S2, respectively. As shown in Tables S1 and S2, 46
different DSTs were identified: 37 were identified in a single
sample and nine were shared by multiple samples (DST142,
DST367, DST601, DST656, DST1593, DST1594, DST1779,
DST1957, and DST1971). Twenty-nine novel DSTs (DST1593,
DST1594, and DST1956–1978) were submitted to the MLST
database (http://calbicans.mlst.net). Their details are presented in
Table S3.
To investigate the evolutionary relationships between the DSTs
isolated in our study, we performed an eBURST analysis and
constructed a dendrogram based on the unweighted-pair group
method using average linkages (UPGMA) on all the C. albicans
DST data in the database (Table S4 and Figure 1). The DSTs
were divided into 18 clades in the UPGMA dendrogram [30], or
103 groups in eBURST analysis, plus singletons. Two DSTs
(DST1957 and DST1978) isolated in our study were singletons,
and the others were distributed among 11 clades.
Overall, DST1593 (in clade 18) was the most common
genotype: it was shared by 32 of the 76 C. albicans carriers (27
dyspeptic patients, one wife of a dyspeptic patient, and four
healthy subjects). However, within the groups, DST1593 was most
common only in the dyspeptic group, in which it comprised 60%
(27/45) of C. albicans carriers (in oral swabs from six subjects,
gastric mucosa from nine subjects, and both sites from 12 subjects)
compared with only 14.8% (4/27) of C. albicans carriers in the
healthy group (P , 0.001). The other DSTs in clade 18
(DST1594, DST1958, DST1970, and DST1971) were all isolated
from the dyspeptic group.
We next compared the DSTs between the three dyspeptic
patients whose wives were also positive for C. albicans. In only one
family, no. 8063, the wife shared the DST1593 C. albicans
genotype with her husband who suffered from superficial gastritis;
their daughter was negative for Candida. Meanwhile, in the other
two families, different DSTs in different clades were isolated
between the dyspeptic patients and their wives (DST1593 versus
DST1957 in family no. 703 and DST1779 versus DST1969 in
family no. 709). The rate of intrafamilial transmission of the same
DST was only 5.6% (1/18).
DST142 (in clade 4) was the second most common genotype
among all the C. albicans isolates, and the most common genotype
in the healthy group. It was isolated from seven subjects (six from
oral swabs from the healthy group and one from an oral swab
from the dyspeptic group). Four of the seven DST142 carriers
were cousins in family no. 2. In another family positive for
DST142, no. 287, the dominant genotype was DST656 (in clade
4), which was identified in three bloodline relatives (the
grandmother [positive for DST142 and DST656], the mother,
and a female baby), whereas the father was positive for DST367
and DST766 (in clade 1). The other DST142-carriers were from
family no. 13 and patient no. 516. Although they lived in the same
province, albeit a different region within it, these four DST142-
positive families would have little chance of encountering each
other. DST1605 and DST1609 (in clade 4) were isolated from
family no. 42; DST1966 and DST1967 (in clade 5) were isolated
from family no. 278. Both sets of genotypes have a very close

evolutionary relationship, suggesting that intrafamilial transmission might have occurred. Therefore, intrafamilial transmission
may have occurred in four of the eighteen families (nos. 2, 42, 278,
and 287; a rate of 22.2%). The distribution of DSTs is presented in
Figure 2.
DST1779 (in clade 15) was isolated from two patient gastric
mucosa samples and one healthy control oral sample. Similar to
DST1593, DST1779 has an intimate link to the dyspeptic group.
In family no. 143, the wife carried DST1593, the wife’s mother,
who suffered from hyperthyreosis and dry mouth, was positive for
DST1779, the wife’s late father died ten years ago from gastric
cancer, and the husband’s mother carried DST1965 (in clade 3).
The husband and the son were not positive for any Candida spp. In
contrast to families nos. 2 and 287, different DSTs in different
clades were isolated from family no. 143.
Both carriers of DST367 (in clade 1) (nos. 287 and 289g) were
from the healthy group, and, being from different families and
different regions, had little chance of encountering each other.
DST1957 (a singleton) was isolated from an oral sample from a
dyspeptic patient (no. 422a) and the wife (no. 703b) of another
patient. Both DST1957 carriers attended the clinic on different
dates, and were from different families and different regions. Thus,
it is unlikely that this DST became shared by different subjects by
nosocomial infection.
In this study, the most common strain group was clade 18,
which was shared by 35 subjects among all the 76 C. albicans

carriers (46.1%), followed by clade 4 (25%), clade 14 (6.6%), clade
15 (6.6%), clade 5 (5.3%), clade 1 (3.9%), singletons (3.9%), clade
3 (2.6%), clade 7 (2.6%), clade 8 (2.6%), clade 9 (1.3%), and clade
12 (1.3%). Most C. albicans isolates in the oral and gastric mucosa
samples from a single subject were in the same clade, except the
fourteen isolates from six patients that were in different clades:
no. 8066 (clades 4 and 18), no. 8113 (clades 7 and 18), no. 8115
(clades 4 and 18), no. 8151 (clades 15 and 18), no. 8184 (clades 8
and 18), and no. 8203 (clades 14 and 18). Most strains in the
healthy group were in clade 4 (48.1%); most strains in the
dyspeptic group were in clade 18 (66.7%). The strains in clades 1
and 3 were not isolated from the dyspeptic group; the strains in
clades 7, 8, 9, 12, and 14 were not isolated from the healthy group.
Discussion
The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence, diversity,
and genetic profiles among C. albicans isolates recovered from
natural colonization of the digestive tract in dyspeptic patients.
We screened oral and/or gastric mucosa samples from 111
subjects with dyspeptic symptoms, and oral samples from 162
healthy volunteers for the presence of Candida spp. Few Candida
species were identified in the dyspeptic group, among which C.
albicans was present in the overwhelming majority of positive
cases in the dyspeptic group (97.8%), but only just over half of
positive cases in the healthy group (56.3%). Furthermore, there
was a significant difference in the species distribution and the C.
albicans genotypes between the dyspeptic patients and the healthy
volunteers. The low pH in the stomach may be the primary
factor for C. albicans being the dominant Candida species in the
gastric mucosa. C. albicans can grow well in an environment of
pH = 2, while most other Candida species cannot [3,42,43]. It
puzzled us why C. albicans was also the dominant Candida species
in the oral environment of the dyspeptic patients, where the pH
is neutral. This needs further study.
We used MLST to evaluate the diversity and genetic
relationships among the 192 C. albicans isolates recovered from
96 samples. A significant number of isolates with identical DSTs
were observed in our study: for instance, DST1593 was found in
60% of C. albicans-positive dyspeptic patients but in only 14.8%
of healthy C. albicans carriers. DST1593 was not isolated from
any of the operators of this study; therefore, nosocomial infection
cannot explain the higher frequency of DST1593 among the
dyspeptic patients.
Strains in clade 18 were isolated from 66.7% of C. albicanscarriers in the dyspeptic group. Meanwhile, the strains in clade 4,

the second most common clade worldwide, were found mainly in
the healthy group (48.1%). This observation is consistent with
differences in the host microenvironment being a primary factor in
determining the different clade strain distributions between
healthy individuals and dyspeptic patients.
According to Sampaio et al. [17], C. albicans genetic variants of
the same strain undergo adaptations to environmental changes in
the host. Adherence to the adhesion molecules of the epithelial
cells by the C. albicans adhesins, and adaptation to the
microenvironment of the host, were shown to be the most
important determinants of whether the C. albicans strains were able
to colonize the host. Thus, the DST1593 C. albicans strains might
be the best suited to the mucosa of the dyspeptic patients, and the
presence of DST1593 could be a sign of susceptibility to dyspepsia.
Another important factor in colonization of the host is whether
the C. albicans strains are tolerated by the host’s immune system.
In this study, DST1779 was likely to be a sign of a complicated
mix of both tolerance and recognition/attack by the immune
system. DST1779 was firstly reported from a patient with
APECED (autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy) in Ireland by McManus et al. [44]. In this study,
one of the three DST1779-carriers suffered from hyperthyreosis
and dry mouth (an autoimmune disease), while the other two
carriers had atrophic gastritis and a gastric ulcer, respectively.
Peptic ulcers have often been reported to have an intricate
relationship with autoimmune disease [45–47]. DST1779 is an
uncommon C. albicans genotype worldwide, and there is little
chance of transmission between the carriers in Shenyang and
Ireland. This suggests, therefore, that DST1779 might be a sign
of autoimmune disease in hosts sharing a similar microenvironment. This is worthy of further study.
Wrobel et al. demonstrated that C. albicans is associated
mainly with humans, and environmental C. albicans isolates are
rare [24]. Their data suggest a great likelihood of C. albicans
person-to-person transmission, and the effect of global human
travel is likely to reduce geographically separated evolutionary
trends [23]. According to the literature, the geographic
specificity that has been proposed for the different clades
should be reconsidered [20,23,30,32,35,48–51]. In the webbased database, the strains in clades 2, 6, and 10 have not been
reported in the Greater China area. In this study, 77.8% of
strains from the healthy group were in clades 1, 3, 4, or 5, and
the strains in these four clades lack geographic or ethnic
differences. Meanwhile, 71.1% of strains from the dyspeptic
group were in clades 14 or 18; all strains in these two clades
have been previously reported from the west coast of the Pacific
Ocean (China, Japan, Korea, and Australia), except for one
case in the UK. It seems that geographic or ethnic differences
might play a minor role for the strains in the healthy group, but
a major role for the strains in the dyspeptic group. It is
unknown whether DST1593 will be isolated from dyspeptic
patients of all areas and races, or only from Asians. This should
be tested in different populations.
In summary, the data presented in this study indicate that the
prevalence of commensal Candida and the distribution of the
Candida species isolated are different between dyspeptic and
healthy individuals. We indicated a link between DST1593 and
dyspepsia; this genotype could be a sign of susceptibility to
dyspepsia.
Future studies should aim to reveal the nature and molecular
basis of these microevolutions in strain, and to evaluate their
impact on the fitness of C. albicans isolates in the context of the host
mucosa. It would also be interesting to investigate to what degree
the DST1593 C. albicans genotype influences susceptibility to
dyspepsia among different ethnic or geographical populations.
Materials and Methods
Ethics Statement
All samples were taken with written informed consent from all
study participants or the parents of the minors. This study was
approved by the Peking University Institutional Review Board.
Specimen Collection
Oral swab samples (n = 111) and human gastric mucosa lesion
samples (n = 102) were obtained from a group of 111 dyspeptic
patients, comprising 39 females and 72 males with a mean age of
47.6 years (median: 46.0 years; range: 18–80). They presented
dyspeptic symptoms or ulcer complaints, involving 77 with chronic
gastritis, 29 with a peptic ulcer, and five with gastric cancer. The
gastric mucosa samples were collected by gastroscopy with a
biopsy for mycological, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), and histological
evaluation. Patients receiving chemotherapy, and also those who
had been treated with steroids or antibiotics before the study, were
excluded. Clinical examination included taking a medical history
and gastroscopy with biopsy.
Oral swab samples (n = 21) were obtained from volunteers
from 18 of the patients’ family members as a family control group.
The samples were provided anonymously, and comprised thirteen
samples from the spouses of thirteen patients, six from the children
of six patients, one from the grandson of one patient, and one from
the mother of one patient. All cases were ascertained in the
Division of Gastroenterology at the First Hospital of Liaoning
University of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Shenyang City,
China, between July 10th and September 12th, 2008.
Oral swab samples (n = 162) were also obtained from healthy
volunteers who had no dyspeptic complaint, comprising 92
females and 70 males with a mean age of 39.47 years (median:
39.50 years; range: 4–81). The volunteers were from 32 families
(i.e., the parents and the first and second generations of their
children) of the students or employees of Liaoning University of
Traditional Chinese Medicine in Shenyang City, China. The
samples were taken between May 1st and October 29th, 2008.
Culture, Identification, MLST, and Analysis of Candida
The oral swab or gastric mucosa samples from each subject
were plated on Sabouraud agar (Tianhe Microorganism Reagent
Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, China) and incubated at 37uC for 48 h.
Yeast colonies were streaked onto CHROM agar Candida medium
(CHROM agar Microbiology, Paris, France) and incubated at
37uC for 48 h. Green colonies were presumed to be C. albicans and
were re-streaked for purification. Two clones from each dish were
picked for further analysis and storage. Verification that the isolate
was C. albicans was accomplished using PCR with primers that
amplified the ITS1–5.8S–ITS2 region of the ribosome-encoding
DNA [52–54]. All C. albicans colonies were further typed by MLST
as described previously [40,41]. The MLST data were assigned to
genotypes for the seven loci sequenced and to DSTs by reference
to the C. albicans MLST database (http://calbicans.mlst.net). The
genetic relatedness between the investigated strains was evaluated
by constructing a UPGMA with arithmetic averages dendrogram
using MEGA software (http://www.megasoftware.net/), which
compares genotypic profiles [30]. The DST data were also
analyzed by eBURST (http://calbicans.mlst.net/eburst/) to
investigate the evolutionary relationships among all the C. albicans
strains in the database.
