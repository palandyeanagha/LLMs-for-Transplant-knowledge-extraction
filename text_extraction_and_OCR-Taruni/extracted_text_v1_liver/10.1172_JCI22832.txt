TLRs are conserved pattern recognition receptors that detect motifs of pathogens and host material released
during injury. For unknown reasons, renal TLR2 mRNA is mainly expressed by tubular cells and is enhanced
upon renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. We evaluated the role of TLR2 in I/R injury using TLR2–/– and
TLR2+/+ mice, TLR2 antisense oligonucleotides, and chimeric mice deficientin leukocyte or renal TLR2. Tubular cells needed TLR2 to produce significant cytokine and chemokine amounts upon ischemia in vitro. TLR2
played a proinflammatory and detrimental role in vivo after I/R injury, as reflected by a reduction in the
amount oflocal cytokines and chemokines, leukocytes, and the level of renal injury and dysfunction in TLR2–/–
mice compared with controls. Analysis of chimeric mice suggested that TLR2 expressed on renal parenchyma
plays a crucial role in the induction ofinflammation and injury.TLR2-antisense treatment protected mice from
renal dysfunction, neutrophil influx, and tubular apoptosis after I/R injury compared with nonsense treatment. In summary, we identified renal-associated TLR2 as an important initiator of inflammatory responses
leading to renal injury and dysfunction in I/R injury. These data imply that TLR2 blockade could provide a
basis for therapeutic strategies to treat or prevent renal ischemic injury.
Introduction
TLRs are highly conserved receptors that have been implicated 
in the immune response to a variety of pathogens. TLRs detect 
exogenous microbial components, which can lead to the induction of innate immune responses (1) and the development of 
antigen-specific adaptive immunity (2). Interestingly, over the 
past few years, it has become clear that TLRs also recognize 
endogenous host material that is released during cellular injury, 
such as degradation products of macromolecules, products of 
proteolytic cascades, intracellular components of ruptured cells, 
and products of genes that are activated by inflammation (3). In 
this way, TLRs can be viewed as crucial surveillance receptors for 
innate and adaptive immunity to detect tissue damage, infection, 
and remodeling (4). Whereas TLRs are preferentially expressed on 
antigen-presenting cells, recent observations suggest that these 
receptors are also expressed on cells that are traditionally not 
regarded as being involved in host defense. Indeed, the majority of TLR2 mRNA in the kidney is constitutively expressed on 
renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs) and epithelial cells from the 
Bowman capsule in the murine kidney and is markedly enhanced 
on these cells upon renal ischemic injury (5). The functional 
significance of this upregulation, however, remains unknown. 
Interestingly, the endogenous cellular injury signals that can 
activate TLR2, such as heat shock proteins (6), and the contents 
of necrotic cells (7) are known to accumulate upon renal ischemic tissue injury (8, 9).
Following injury of TECs in renal ischemia, a cascade of proinflammatory mediators that can lead to amplification of injury 
either directly or indirectly is activated. The primary mechanism 
through which the kidney initiates this inflammatory cascade 
has, however, not yet been elucidated. As TECs belong to the nonimmune cells that express and upregulate TLR2 after ischemic 
injury, it might be hypothesized that this TEC-associated receptor plays a key role in the initiation of inflammation after renal 
ischemia. In support of this, the role of TLR2 in chemokine 
production by mouse renal TECs after stimulation with bacterial products in vitro has already been reported (10). Since renal 
ischemia is a major cause of acute (11) and end-stage renal failure 
(12), producing serious morbidity and mortality, and in addition 
is an important inducer of acute renal transplant rejection and 
delayed allograft function (13, 14), improved knowledge of the 
primary mechanisms involved in monitoring and mediating renal 
ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is essential for the development 
of therapeutic strategies. The activation of TLR by ligands released 
during I/R injury may be an important link between an inflammatory immune response in the kidney and damage in this organ 
and in addition might trigger renal allograft rejection by activating 
innate and adaptive immune responses.
Together, these data prompted us to investigate the role of 
TLR2 in ischemic injury and repair in the kidney. For this, we 
induced renal I/R injury in TLR2–/– or TLR2+/+ mice, chimeric 
mice deficient in leukocyte or renal TLR2, and analyzed the subsequent pathophysiology. In addition, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of TLR2 antisense therapy for the treatment of 
renal ischemia as these nucleotides are known to be taken up 
mainly by the kidney, i.e., TECs (15).

Results
Reduced chemokine and cytokine production by cultured TLR2–/– TECs 
after simulated ischemia. As cytokines and chemokines produced 
by renal TECs are critical factors in the inflammatory response 
during renal I/R injury (16), we measured some of the main 
proteins among this family that are known to be produced by 
TECs (17–22). As shown in Figure 1, the amount of granulocyte 
chemotactic keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC) and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) (23, 24) and monocyte 
chemotactic monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) (25) 
was significantly lower in supernatants of TLR2–/– TECs when 
subjected to simulated ischemia as compared with TLR2+/+ TECs. 
Furthermore, TLR2–/– TECs produced significantly less proinflammatory IL-6 after simulated ischemia than TLR2+/+ TECs, 
while the production of IL-1β and TNF-α could not be detected. 
In addition, when TLR2–/– TECs were stimulated with kidney 
homogenates of mice subjected for 1 day to renal I/R injury, significantly less KC (5791.5 ± 176.0 [TLR2+/+] vs. 3404.0 ± 208.0 
[TLR2–/–] pg/ml; P < 0.05), MIP-2 (293.0 ± 11.9 [TLR2+/+] vs. 
239.0 ± 8.3 [TLR2–/–]; P < 0.05), and MCP-1 (472.0 ± 13.5 [TLR2+/+] 
vs. 265.7 ± 265.7 [TLR2–/–]; P < 0.05) was produced than with 
TLR2+/+ TECs. IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α could not be detected.
Reduced chemokine and cytokine levels in TLR2–/– mice subjected to 
renal I/R injury. We next investigated whether TLR2 deficiency 
also influenced early chemokine and cytokine production in vivo 
after renal I/R injury. For this we measured KC, MIP-2, MCP-1, 
TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 protein in kidney homogenates of TLR2–/–
mice and TLR2+/+ mice 1 day after renal I/R injury. This revealed 
that early KC and MCP-1 levels were significantly lower in kidney 
homogenates from TLR2–/– mice compared with those in TLR2+/+
mice, while renal MIP-2 levels were similar in both groups of animals (Figure 2). In addition, kidneys from TLR2–/– mice contained 
significantly less IL-1β and IL-6 compared with kidneys from 
TLR2+/+ mice (Figure 2). Although renal TNF-α levels followed a 
similar trend, this difference did not reach statistical significance 
(P = 0.08, Figure 2). As a previous study implied that TNF-α levels 
were maximal 1 to 2 hours after the induction of I/R injury (26), 
we additionally measured this cytokine 2 hours after reperfusion. 
Although higher TNF-α levels were found at this early stage after 
the induction of I/R injury as compared with the 1-day time point, 
no significant differences could be found between TLR2–/– mice 
(19.7 ± 2.9) and TLR2+/+ mice (25.9 ± 2.4; P = 0.1).
Reduced influx of interstitial granulocytes and macrophages in TLR2–/–
mice. To evaluate the effect of chemokine and cytokine production on in vivo leukocyte influx, we analyzed the amount of granulocytes and macrophages in the injured kidneys of TLR2+/+ and 
TLR2–/– mice. Interestingly, significantly fewer interstitial infiltrated granulocytes were found in TLR2–/– mice 1 day after renal 
I/R as compared with TLR2+/+ mice (Figure 3, A and B). Five and 10 
days after I/R injury, levels of granulocyte infiltration went back to 
control levels and did not differ between TLR2+/+ and TLR2–/– mice 
(Figure 3A). Macrophages mainly infiltrated the outer medullas of 
kidneys from TLR2+/+ mice 1 day after I/R injury with a maximum 
on day 5. Importantly, a significant decrease was observed in the 
number of interstitial infiltrated macrophages in the TLR2–/– mice 
1 and 5 days after I/R when compared with TLR2+/+ mice (Figure 
3, C and D). No significant differences in the number of interstitial infiltrated macrophages were found 10 days after I/R injury 
between TLR2–/– mice and TLR2+/+ mice (Figure 3C) when injury 
was already repaired (Figures 4 and 5). Together, these data suggest 
an important role for TLR2 in the induction of a proinflammatory 
immune response during renal I/R injury.
TLR2 deficiency reduced renal dysfunction and the extent of acute tubular damage. To study the effect of TLR2 deficiency on renal function 
after I/R injury, we measured levels of serum creatinine and ureum

at different time points in TLR2–/– and TLR2+/+ mice. TLR2+/+ mice 
showed a transient renal dysfunction (peak serum creatinine and 
ureum on day 1) with almost complete recovery by day 10 as compared with sham-operated animals (Figure 4). TLR2–/– mice, however, were partially protected against acute renal failure as reflected 
by significantly lower serum creatinine and ureum levels as compared with TLR2+/+ mice. To confirm that renal injury was present and to investigate the impact of TLR2 deficiency on tubular 
injury, we next evaluated renal histology. After 1 day of reperfusion, ischemic kidneys of TLR2+/+ mice showed widespread tubular 
necrosis, tubular dilation, brush border loss, and cast formation 
in the outer medullas of the kidneys (Figure 5B). Kidneys from 
TLR2–/– mice displayed, however, significantly less tubular damage 
when compared with those of TLR2+/+ mice 1 and 5 days after renal 
I/R injury (Figure 5A). We found an almost complete recovery of 
tubular cells by day 10 as compared with sham-operated control 
mice. Thus, TLR2 deficiency had a profound protective effect on 
renal function and damage after renal I/R induction.
TLR2–/– mice show less tubular epithelial apoptosis and regeneration in 
I/R renal injury. Next to cell infiltration, I/R injury in the kidney is 
characterized by TEC apoptosis. As TLR2 is identified as a novel 
“death receptor” that is connected to the apoptotic machinery 
(27), we assessed the amount of tubular apoptosis during renal 
I/R injury by immunohistochemical staining for active-caspase 
3 (Figure 6B). Compared with sham-operated animals, mice 
subjected to I/R injury demonstrated significant TEC apoptosis within 1 day (Figure 6A). Notably, the number of apoptotic 
TECs in kidneys from TLR2–/– mice was markedly lower than that 
in kidneys from TLR2+/+ mice 1 and 5 days after renal I/R injury 
(Figure 6A). Next, we investigated regeneration of injured tubular 
cells after ischemic renal injury by measuring DNA synthesis via 
immunohistochemical staining for BrdU (Figure 6D). One day 
after ischemic renal injury, proliferation of tubular cells began, 
reaching a maximum on day 5. The number of BrdU-positive TECs 
in kidneys from TLR2–/– mice was significantly lower than that in 
kidneys from TLR2+/+ mice 1 and 5 days after injury (Figure 6C).
Generation of chimeric mice. Since TLR2 is expressed on both leukocytes and renal parenchyma, we next examined the contribution 
of these cell types to the outcome of renal I/R injury. We utilized 
bone marrow transplantation in irradiated TLR2–/– and TLR2+/+
mice in order to generate chimeric mice expressing TLR2 on leukocytes but not on renal parenchyma cells (kidney-TLR2–/– mice, 
n = 10) as well as mice expressing TLR2 on renal parenchyma 
cells but not on leukocytes (leukocyte-TLR2–/– mice, n = 10). We 
determined the expression of TLR2 on blood neutrophils and 
monocytes by flow cytometric analysis, as these cells express TLR2 
(28) and are central mediators of renal tissue injury (29–31). This

with TLR2+/+ animals after renal I/R as counted in 10 randomly selected high-power fields (HPFs) on outer medulla. Leukocytes from 8 mice

analysis revealed that the neutrophil and monocyte compartments 
of all mice consisted of at least 95.6% (TLR2+ granulocytes) and 
88.2% (TLR2– monocytes) donor-derived cells, indicating extensive 
engraftment 6 weeks after transplantation (Figure 7). No differences were found in the total number of white blood cells between 
both groups of animals prior to the induction of renal I/R injury 
(leukocyte-TLR2–/– mice: 7.4 ± 0.6 × 106/ml vs. kidney-TLR2–/– mice: 
6.2 ± 0.8 × 106/ml; P = 0.19).
Increased renal dysfunction, granulocyte influx, and TEC apoptosis in 
TLR2+/+ mice is mediated by renal-associated TLR2. To study whether 
TLR2 expressed on the kidney and/or on infiltrated leukocytes 
contributes to renal I/R injury, we compared serum creatinine and 
ureum levels of kidney-TLR2–/– mice and leukocyte-TLR2–/– mice. 
Interestingly, we found that kidney-TLR2–/– mice were partly protected against renal failure as reflected by significantly lower serum 
creatinine and ureum levels as compared with leukocyte-TLR2–/–
mice 1 day after reperfusion (Figure 8A). Further analysis revealed 
that the number of granulocytes and apoptotic tubular cells in 
kidneys from kidney-TLR2–/– mice was significantly lower 1 day 
after I/R injury than that in kidneys from leukocyte-TLR2–/– mice 
(Figure 8B). Together, these data suggest that TLR2 expressed on 
the renal parenchyma plays a primary role in the early induction 
of inflammation and I/R injury.
Distribution and effect of antisense oligonucleotides in vivo. To confirm 
our in vivo data and to determine whether TLR2 antisense oligonucleotide (ASON) treatment could affect clinical outcome of renal 
disease, we evaluated TLR2 ASON treatment in mice after renal I/R 
injury. First, we analyzed the distribution of ASON uptake using 
FITC-labeled ASONs. This revealed that oligonucleotide accumulation was greatest in kidney and liver, intermediate in spleen, and 
very low in lung (data not shown). ASONs were predominantly targeted to renal tubular cells (Figure 9A, left panel) and epithelial cells 
from the Bowman capsule (Figure 9A, right panel), even when renal 
arteries were clamped for 45 minutes (data not shown). FITC was 
not detected within the glomerular tuft (Figure 9A, right panel). To 
assess whether systemic administration of TLR2 ASONs inhibited 
the amount of TLR2 protein, we also analyzed TLR2 in kidney from 
mice subjected for 1 day to renal I/R injury by immunoblotting 
and immunohistochemistry. As shown in Figure 9, B and C, TLR2 
ASONs were able to reduce the amount of TLR2 protein in the kidney as compared with nonsense oligonucleotides (NSONs).
Reduction in renal dysfunction, granulocyte influx, and TEC apoptosis 
after TLR2 ASON treatment. To evaluate whether TLR2 ASON treatment could influence clinical outcome of renal ischemic injury, 
TLR2 ASONs and NSONs were delivered i.p. to mice before and

during the induction of I/R injury. Most interestingly, we found 
that mice treated with TLR2 ASONs had a markedly improved 
renal function 1 day after I/R injury compared with mice treated 
with control NSONs, as reflected by significantly lower serum creatinine and ureum levels (Figure 10A). We found an almost complete recovery of renal function by days 5 and 10 as compared with 
sham-operated mice. Accordingly, the number of apoptotic TECs 
and granulocytes in kidneys from TLR2 ASON-treated mice was 
significantly lower 1 day after I/R injury than that in kidneys from 
NSON-treated animals (Figure 10B). No significant differences 
were found in the number of neutrophils and apoptotic TECs 5 
and 10 days after I/R injury between TLR2–/– mice and TLR2+/+
mice (Figure 10B) when injury was already repaired (Figure 10A).
Discussion
The pathogenesis of I/R renal injury involves a complex interaction among renal hemodynamics, tubular injury, and subsequent 
inflammatory responses. In the latter processes, TECs are central 
players, i.e., injury of these cells can result in a cascade of responses 
that lead to the local production of proinflammatory mediators, 
which in turn can increase renal injury and dysfunction by, for 
instance, causing increased migration of proinflammatory cells 
into the renal parenchyma (32). The precise mechanisms through 
which TECs initiate these proinflammatory responses in vivo have 
not been elucidated completely. In the present study, we identified 
TLR2 expressed on renal parenchyma as an important player in 
the initiation of an exaggerated inflammatory response leading 
to renal injury and dysfunction in I/R injury of the kidney in vivo. 
Moreover, we found that TLR2 ASON treatment decreased dysfunction of the kidney after renal I/R injury in vivo.
Renal TECs from mice constitutively express mRNA for TLR2 
both in vitro (10) and in vivo (5), which is upregulated after 
ischemic stress in vivo (5). The functional implication of this 
upregulation has remained, however, unidentified. The current 
study demonstrates that endogenous TLR2 plays a proinflammatory role in vivo after renal I/R injury, as reflected by reduced 
cytokine and chemokine production as well as reduced leukocyte 
infiltration in TLR2–/– mice as compared with TLR2+/+ animals. 
These observations are compatible with our in vitro data, in which 
we found that primary murine TECs need TLR2 in order to produce significant amounts of chemokines and cytokines after simulated ischemia and stimulation with ischemic kidney homogenate. 
Together, these observations suggest that renal cells are able to 
produce cellular injury signals in response to ischemia that can 
induce an inflammatory response via TLR2. TLR2 has previously 
been shown to be required for chemokine production of murine 
TECs that are exposed to bacterial components in vitro (10). Moreover, oxidative stress in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes has activated 
the potent inducer of proinflammatory cytokine gene expression 
NF-κB via TLR2 (33, 34). Apparently, TLR2 is capable of monitoring cellular injury caused by ischemic stress and is subsequently 
crucial for the initiation of a proinflammatory immune response 
during ischemia. Possible endogenous ligands for TLR2 that are 
known to accumulate during ischemic stress (8, 9) are heat shock 
protein-70 (6) and the contents of necrotic cells (7). It can be posFigure 7

tulated that the activation of TLR by ligands released during renal 
I/R injury may be a key link between a proinflammatory immune 
response in the kidney and renal damage and dysfunction. Indeed, 
mice deficient for TLR2 had less severe renal damage and dysfunction than wild-type mice as well as an early impaired leukocyte 
influx. These data emphasize the concept of Anders et al. suggesting that family members of TLRs might play an important role 
in the pathogenesis of a number of renal diseases (35). Although 
the role of neutrophils in I/R injury is controversial (36, 37), many 
studies suggest that these cells mediate tissue injury and contribute to the development of renal failure (29, 30, 38, 39). For that reason, the impaired neutrophil influx in kidneys from TLR2–/– mice, 
presumably as a consequence of reduced renal proinflammatory 
cytokine and chemokine levels, would explain the lower degree 
of renal damage and dysfunction in these animals compared 
with controls. In addition, diminished macrophage numbers in 
TLR2–/– mice could also contribute to the reduced renal damage in 
these animals. Indeed, activated macrophages are able 
to release soluble molecules that are known to cause 
renal damage (40), and depletion of these cells appears 
protective against ischemic acute renal failure (31). The 
impaired macrophage influx in TLR2–/– mice compared 
with TLR2+/+ animals is probably due to reduced MCP-1 
levels in the kidney and may reflect the reduced need 
for these cells to phagocytose and remove the lower amount of 
necrotic and apoptotic TECs. An alternative and attractive explanation for the preserved renal function in TLR2–/– mice could also 
be the reduction in TEC apoptosis we found after ischemic injury. 
Indeed, it is suggested that apoptosis in the kidney, either directly 
or indirectly, significantly contributes to I/R-induced inflammation as well as to the consequent tissue damage (41). The reduction in TEC apoptosis in TLR2–/– mice can be explained by previous work implying a proapoptotic function of TLR2. That is, 
stimulation of TLR2 by bacterial lipoproteins induces apoptosis 
in monocytic cells by caspase activation (27, 42). Besides the reduction in death of TECs, we also found significantly less regeneration 
of these cells in TLR2–/– mice as compared with TLR2+/+ animals. 
The latter could reflect the reduced tubular damage in these animals. Conversely, the decrease in TEC proliferation could indicate 
that TLR2 is necessary for tissue repair. This is in agreement with 
findings of Lee et al. demonstrating that necrotic cells can directly 
enhance the expression of genes that play a role in inflammatory 
and tissue-repair responses through activation of the NF-κB and 
TLR2 pathways (7).
To investigate whether the impaired renal function and 
increased inflammatory response in TLR2+/+ mice was due to 
renal-associated and/or leukocyte-associated TLR2, we next generated chimeric mice by means of bone marrow transplantation 
in irradiated mice. This study showed that during I/R injury, 
TLR2 on renal parenchyma plays a crucial role in the early development of acute renal failure, as reflected by a lower amount of 
serum ureum/creatinine in kidney-TLR2–/– mice as compared 
with in leukocyte-TLR2–/– mice. Renal TLR2 could be involved

in the induction of renal failure by participating in an exaggerated proinflammatory response. Indeed, we found an impaired 
granulocyte influx in kidneys from kidney-TLR2–/– mice as compared with leukocyte-TLR2–/– mice. This is consistent with our 
in vitro data indicating that tubular cells need TLR2 to produce 
significant amounts of neutrophil chemokines during ischemic 
conditions. In addition, we show a reduction in apoptotic tubular cells in kidneys from kidney-TLR2–/– mice as compared with 
leukocyte-TLR2–/– mice, again stressing a possible proapoptotic 
role for TLR2 on tubular cells. Evidently, TLR2 expressed on renal 
cells plays a crucial role in renal I/R pathogenesis, presumably by 
inducing a proinflammatory response.
To determine whether the proinflammatory and detrimental 
effects of TLR2 we found were due to a compensatory mechanism 
in the knockout animals and to determine whether TLR2 ASON 
treatment could affect the clinical outcome of renal disease, we 
next studied the effect of TLR2 ASON treatment on mice after 
renal I/R injury. In line with previous studies (15, 43), we found 
that the kidney is the major site of ASON uptake, with the highest accumulation in TECs as well as epithelial cells from the Bowman capsule and with much lower uptake by cells in other segments of the nephron. Therefore, the kidney may be an ideal target 
organ for application of TLR2 ASONs in vivo. Indeed, we found 
that TLR2 ASON treatment reduced renal dysfunction after I/R 
injury as reflected by lower serum ureum and creatinine levels as 
compared with NSON treatment. Similar to our previous results, 
we found that the increased renal function seems to be correlated 
to an inhibition of the exaggerated proinflammatory response as 
shown by an impaired granulocyte influx in kidneys from mice 
treated with TLR2 ASONs as compared with NSONs. In addition, 
we found a reduction in apoptotic TECs in kidneys from mice 
treated with TLR2 ASONs as compared with NSON-treated animals. The use of antisense technology has already been successfully applied to treat renal ischemic injury in animals, i.e., ICAM-1 
antisense ASONs, which block adhesion of inflammatory cells, 
prevented renal I/R injury and enhanced immediate graft function in renal transplantation in rats in a more downstream manner (44, 45). That blockade of TLR2 signaling might be promising 
in the prevention of ischemia-induced renal allograft rejection 
and delayed allograft function is supported by a study demonstrating that mice deficient in TLR2 had a delay in skin allograft 
rejection (46). Taken together, these data suggest that blockade of 
an inappropriate immune response with specific TLR2 signaling 
antagonists such as antisense could provide a theoretical basis for 
the development of therapeutic strategies meant to slow down or 
prevent renal ischemic injury. A possible effect of ASONs outside 
the kidney should, however, be taken into account.
Although TLR2 is ultimately disadvantageous for the development of I/R injury in the kidney, it should be noted that this receptor plays a beneficial role in the immune response against invading 
pathogens (47), which might explain the presence of this highly 
conserved receptor in the kidney. Indeed, TLR2 is critical for resistance to many invading pathogens in different organ systems by 
induction of a proinflammatory response, as reviewed by Takeda 
and Akira (47). To date, 3 studies of the urinary system describe an 
important and beneficial role for TLR4 and TLR11 in the defense 
against Escherichia coli (48–50).
This study is, to our knowledge, the first to show that endogenous TLR2 plays a proinflammatory and detrimental role in the 
kidney after renal ischemic injury in vivo, as reflected by reduced 
cytokine and chemokine production, reduced leukocyte infiltration, and a lower degree of renal dysfunction and tubular damage in mice deficient for TLR2. Most importantly, the induction 
of I/R-induced inflammation and injury seems to be mediated 
by TLR2 that is expressed on renal cells. This study strongly supports the idea that the function of TLR2 extends beyond host 
defence against invading pathogens. TLR2 appears to be capable 
of monitoring ischemic damaged kidney and as a result is crucial 
for activating primary immune responses in this organ. These 
results provide new insights into the primary mechanism by which 
the kidney regulates inflammatory responses and the way renal 
ischemic injury is monitored. They will also assist us in evaluating the therapeutic potential of TLR2 antisense therapy for the 
treatment of renal ischemia. As no effective treatment is available 
for renal injury following ischemia (51), blockade of an inappropriate/detrimental immune response with specific TLR signaling 
antagonists such as antisense could represent a new approach for 
treating or preventing renal failure and renal transplant rejection 
and dysfunction caused by renal ischemia.
Methods
Mice. Pathogen-free 9- to 12-week-old male C57BL/6 wild-type mice were 
purchased from Charles River Laboratories. TLR2–/– mice were generated 
as described previously (52), backcrossed to C57BL/6 background 6 times, 
and bred in the animal facility of the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Age- and sex-matched mice were used in all experiments. The Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Amsterdam approved all experiments.
Primary culture of mouse renal TECs. Primary mouse renal TECs were generated following the method described by Wuthrich et al. (53). Briefly, the 
renal capsule was removed, and tissue from the outer cortex was cut into 
pieces of approximately 1 mm3. Then single cortical tubular cell suspensions of freshly dissected kidney cortices from TLR2+/+ and TLR2–/– mice 
(4 mice per group) were prepared by collagenase type 1A (Sigma-Aldrich) 
dispersion at 37°C for 1 hour and washed in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco 
BRL; Invitrogen Corp.). TECs were subsequently grown in duplicate to confluence on 6-well plates for 10 days in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented 
with 10% FCS (Integro), 2 mM l-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 
µg/ml streptomycin (all from Invitrogen Corp.). TECs were identified by 
characteristic polygonal or cobblestone-shaped morphology.
Simulated ischemia in renal TECs in vitro. Ischemia in renal TECs was simulated by immersing the cellular monolayer in mineral oil according to the 
protocol of Meldrum et al. (54). This method has also been applied for 
the induction of ischemia in cultured myocytes (55, 56). This immersion 
simulated ischemia by depriving cells of oxygen and nutrients as well as by 
limiting metabolite washout (56, 57). In brief, cells were serum starved for 
24 hours, washed twice with PBS, and immersed in mineral oil for 60 minutes at 37°C. After extensive washing, cells were incubated for 24 hours in 
medium. Intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) measurements were 
performed with the ATP Bioluminescence Assay Kit HS II (Roche Diagnostics Corp.) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cell lysates were 
analyzed for ATP levels using a Lumat luminometer (Berthold Technologies). To correct for possible loss of cells due to hypoxic stress, the protein 
content of the lysates was measured with the Bradford Protein Assay (BioRad Laboratories). Measurements showed marked ATP depletion consistent with ischemic conditions. Moreover, no differences in ATP depletion 
were found between TLR2+/+ (71.0% ± 5.8% of control) and TLR2–/– TECs 
(60.1% ± 3.5 % of control), which could indicate a differential effect of mineral oil on KO versus wild-type TECs (P = 0.34). In a separate experiment, 
TECs were serum starved overnight and stimulated for 24 hours with

kidney homogenate (obtained as described hereafter) of mice that had 
been subjected to renal I/R and sacrificed after 1 day. Supernatants were 
subsequently collected and stored at –70°C until ELISAs were performed. 
The number of cells present in the wells after injury/stimulation was determined by treating cells with trypsine-EDTA after which suspended cells 
were counted using a hemacytometer. This revealed no statistically significant differences in the number of TLR2+/+ and TLR2–/– TECs. Cytokine 
levels present in the kidney homogenate used to stimulate TECs were subsequently substracted from the level of cytokines detected in supernatants 
24 hours after stimulation.
Renal I/R injury model. Renal I/R injury was induced as described previously (58). Briefly, renal arteries were clamped for 45 minutes using 
microaneurysm clamps through a midline abdominal incision under general anesthesia (0.07 ml/10 g mouse of fentanyl citrate fluanisone midazolam mixture containing: 1.25 mg/ml midazolam [Roche Diagnostics 
Corp.], 0.08 mg/ml fentanyl citrate, and 2.5 mg/ml fluanisone [Janssen 
Pharmaceutica]). After clamp removal, kidneys were inspected for restoration of blood flow. The abdomen was closed in 2 layers, and all mice 
received a subcutaneous injection of 50 µg/kg buprenorphin (Temgesic; 
Schering-Plough) for analgetic purposes and were allowed to recover from 
surgery for 12 hours at 32°C in a ventilated stove. Sham-operated mice 
(n = 8 per group) underwent the same procedure without clamping and 
were sacrificed 1 day after surgery. To maintain fluid balance and volume 
status, mice were supplemented with 1 ml sterile 0.9% NaCl i.p. To mark 
proliferating cells, 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU; Sigma-Aldrich) was 
injected i.p. (50 mg/kg body wt) 1 hour before sacrifice. Mice (n = 8 per 
group) were sacrificed 1, 5, and 10 days after surgery. To measure early 
TNF-α levels, 6 mice per group were sacrificed 2 hours after reperfusion. 
At the time of sacrifice, mice were weighed, blood was collected by heart 
puncture in heparin-containing tubes and stored at –70°C, and kidneys 
were harvested for further analysis. No significant differences were found 
between weights of TLR2+/+ and TLR2–/– mice at all time points (24.1 ± 0.27 
and 24.7 ± 1.0 g, respectively; P = 0.74 for t = 1, the time point with the 
highest level of renal dysfunction).
Bone marrow transplantation. Total bone marrow was collected from 
female TLR2+/+ or TLR2–/– mice by flushing femurs and tibiae with sterile 
PBS containing 10% FCS, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen Corp.). To ensure short-term survival of the recipients 
(59), single cell suspension of a syngeneic spleen from a female TLR2+/+
or TLR2–/– mice was obtained by crushing spleens in PBS containing 10% 
FCS, penicillin, and streptomycin through a 40-µm cell strainer (BD). Male 
TLR2+/+ (n = 12) and TLR2–/– (n = 12) mice were lethally irradiated with 2 
doses of 5 Gy, separated by 3 hours, using a 137Cs irradiator (CIS bio international; SCHERING S.A.). After the last irradiation dose, 5 × 106 TLR2+/+
or TLR2–/– bone marrow cells and 2 × 105 TLR2+/+ or TLR2–/– spleen cells 
in sterile PBS were injected into the tail vein of recipient irradiated mice. 
The mice were kept in microisolator cages for 6 weeks to complete engraftment with donor bone marrow, after which renal I/R injury was induced 
as described above. One week prior and 4 weeks following transplantation, 
mice received sterile acidified tap water (12 × 10–3 M HCl) containing 0.16% 
neomycin sulphate (Sigma-Aldrich) to prevent the immunocompromised 
recipients from infections.
FACS analysis. To assay bone marrow reconstitution, whole blood collected from tails was harvested from mice prior to I/R surgery and analyzed 
by flow cytometry to determine donor/recipient chimerism of the hematopoietic compartment. Total white blood cell counts were performed 
on a Coulter ACT diff2 (Beckman Coulter). Subsequently, erythrocytes 
were lysed for 10 minutes at 4°C in 160 mM NH4Cl, 10 mM KHCO3, and 
0.1 mM EDTA (pH 7.4). Remaining leukocytes were brought to a concentration of 4 × 106 cells/ml FACS buffer (PBS supplemented with 0.5% BSA, 
0.01% NaN3, and 100 mM EDTA) and stained for TLR2 (IgG1k anti-TLR2 
mAb named T2.5; ref. 60) and a secondary goat anti-mouse IgG1-FITC 
(SouthernBiotech) for 30 minutes at 4°C. TLR2 was analyzed on forwardand side-angle scatter–gated neutrophils and monocytes known to mediate tissue injury and to express TLR2. The number of positive cells was 
determined by setting a quadrant marker for nonspecific staining. To correct for background staining, unlabeled cells were used. All analyses were 
performed on a FACSCalibur (BD).
Distribution of FITC-ASONs in vivo. To examine the in vivo distribution 
of ASONs, TLR2+/+ mice were treated twice i.p. with 4 nmol FITC-labeled 
ASONs (ACTACTACACTAGACTAC) 29 hours and 5 hours before sacrifice. To evaluate whether FITC-ASONs could also reach the kidney when 
renal arteries are clamped, we gave this compound 24 hours before and 
directly after the induction of renal I/R injury. These oligonucleotides were 
designed and manufactured by Biognostik. Kidney, liver, lung, and spleen 
were removed, fixed for 24 hours in 10% formalin, and embedded in paraffin. Sections of 4 µm were deparaffinized and boiled for 10 minutes in 10 
mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0). Subsequently, endogenous peroxidase 
activity and nonspecific binding were blocked with 0.3% H2O2 in 100% 
methanol and 10% normal goat serum (DakoCytomation). Sections were 
then exposed to rabbit anti-FITC (DakoCytomation), and this was followed 
by a further incubation with HRP-conjugated goat-anti rabbit IgG (PowerVision; ImmunoVision Technologies Co.). Slides were developed using 
1% H2O2 and 3,3′-diaminobenzidin-tetra-hydrochloride (DAB) (SigmaAldrich) in 0.05 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.9). The slides were counterstained with 
Methyl Green (Sigma-Aldrich).
TLR2 ASON treatment of mice. Mice were injected twice i.p. with 4 nmol 
TLR2 ASONs (GAGCTCGTAGCATCCTCT) or 4 nmol NSONs (GCTCTATGACTCCCAG) (both designed and manufactured by Biognostik) 24 
hours before, during, and 2 days after the induction of renal I/R injury 
and sacrificed after 1, 5, and 10 days as described above. Sham-operated 
mice underwent the same procedure without clamping and were sacrificed 
1 day after surgery. No significant differences were found between the 
weights of NSON- and ASON-treated mice at all time points (26.1 ± 0.3 
and 25.2 ± 0.5 g, respectively; P = 0.19 for t = 1, the time point with the 
highest level of renal dysfunction).
Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Kidney homogenates from ASONand NSON-treated animals subjected for 1 day to renal I/R injury were 
diluted in lysis buffer containing 300 mM NaCl, 30 mM Tris, 2 mM MgCl2, 
2 mM CaCl2, 1% Triton X-100, and 1% protease inhibitor cocktail II (SigmaAldrich), homogenized, sonicated, and incubated at 4°C for 30 minutes. 
Renal homogenates (40 µg protein) were centrifuged, after which supernatants (cell lysates) were cleared by addition of Protein G-Sepharose beads 
for 1 hour at 4°C and incubated with 2 µg anti-TLR2 (IgG1k anti-TLR2 
mAb T2.5) for 1 hour at 4°C. Immune complexes were collected on Protein 
G-Sepharose beads during 1 hour incubation at 4°C and eluted by incubation in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 300 mM NaCl, 2% NP-40, 20% glycerol, 
10 mM EDTA, 4 mM Na3VO4, 10 mM NaF, and 1% protease inhibitor cocktail II). Fractions before and after immunoprecipitation (to detect β-actin 
and TLR2, respectively) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto 
activated PVDF membranes (Millipore). Subsequently, membranes were 
blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 
0.1% Tween (TBS-T) and incubated with primary antibody (affinity purified rabbit polyclonal anti-murine TLR2, monoclonal anti–β-actin; SigmaAldrich), followed by incubation with goat anti-rabbit HRP (DakoCytomation) or goat anti-mouse HRP (BioSource International), respectively, and 
visualized with ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).
Preparation of renal tissue for cytokine measurements. For cytokine measurements, snap-frozen kidneys were diluted in lysis buffer and homogenized 
and incubated at 4°C for 30 minutes. Homogenates were subsequently

centrifuged at 1500 g at 4°C for 15 minutes, and supernatants were stored 
at –70°C until assays were performed.
ELISA. Cytokines and chemokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, KC, MIP-2, and 
MCP-1) were measured using specific ELISAs (R&D Systems) according to 
manufacturer instructions. The detection limits were 31 pg/ml for TNF-α, 
8 pg/ml for IL-1, 16 pg/ml for IL-6, 12 pg/ml for KC, 94 pg/ml for MIP-2, 
and 7 pg/ml for MCP-1. Cytokine levels were corrected for the amount 
of protein present using the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories) 
with IgG as standard.
Detection of granulocytes and macrophages. Renal tissues were fixed for 24 
hours in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin. Sections of 4 µm were 
deparaffinized and digested with a solution of 0.25% pepsine (SigmaAldrich) in 0.01M HCl for granulocyte detection or boiled for 10 minutes 
in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for macrophage detection. Subsequently, endogenous peroxidase activity and nonspecific binding were 
blocked as described, and sections were exposed to FITC-labeled antimouse Ly-6G mAb (BD Biosciences — Pharmingen) or rat anti-mouse F4/80 
IgG2b mAb (Serotec), respectively. For staining of granulocytes, slides were 
incubated with rabbit anti-FITC antibody (DakoCytomation), which was 
followed by a further incubation with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit 
IgG (ImmunoVision Technologies Co.) For macrophage staining, slides 
were incubated with rabbit anti-rat biotin (DakoCytomation), which was 
followed by streptavidin-ABC solution (DakoCytomation). The slides were 
developed using 1% H2O2 and DAB (Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.05M Tris-HCl 
(pH 7.9) and counterstained with Methyl Green (Sigma-Aldrich); the number of positive cells was counted in 10 nonoverlapping fields (×400).
Detection of apoptosis and proliferation. Tissue sections of kidneys were 
deparaffinized and boiled for 10 minutes in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer 
(pH 6.0). Nonspecific binding and endogenous peroxidase activity were blocked 
as described, followed by incubation with rabbit anti-human active caspase 
3 polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology), followed by a further 
incubation with HRP-conjugated goat-anti rabbit IgG (ImmunoVision Technologies Co.), and further processed as described above. To detect BrdU, DNA 
was denatured in 2 M HCl, and antigen retrieval was performed by 0.4% pepsin 
(Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.01M HCl. Sections were then incubated in 5% normal 
goat serum (DakoCytomation), 0.1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich), 
and 0.1% Tween-20 (Sigma-Aldrich) and exposed to mouse IgG1 anti-BrdU 
antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich). This was followed by a further incubation with 
goat anti-mouse IgG1-HRP (SouthernBiotech). Slides were finally developed 
using 1% H2O2 and DAB (Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.05M Tris-HCl (pH 7.9). The 
slides were counterstained with Methyl Green (Sigma-Aldrich), and the number of positive TECs were counted in 10 nonoverlapping fields (×400).
Detection of TLR2. Kidneys were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and 
stored at –70°C prior to use. For histological examination of TLR2, kidneys were cut into 6-µm sections, fixed for 10 minutes with ice-cold acetone, and air dried. The sections were incubated in 5% normal goat serum 
(DakoCytomation) for 10 minutes and then exposed overnight to antiTLR2 mAb T2.5 in PBS. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched 
by a solution of 10% NaN3/0.03% H2O2 (Merck) in PBS. Slides were incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG-1-HRP (Southern Biotechnology Associates) with 5% normal human serum, rinsed again, and developed using 
NovaRed (Vector Laboratories).
Histopathological scoring. All histopathological scorings were made in the 
cortex using PAS-D–stained renal tissue sections and performed on coded 
slides. The percentage of damaged tubules in the corticomedullary junction was estimated using a 5-point scale according to the following criteria: 
tubular dilatation, cast deposition, brush border loss, and necrosis in 10 
randomly chosen, nonoverlapping fields (×400 magnification). Lesions 
were graded on a scale from 0 to 5: 0 = normal; 1 = mild, involvement of 
less than 10% of the cortex; 2 = moderate, involvement of 10 to 25% of the 
cortex; 3 = severe, involvement of 25 to 50% of the cortex; 4 = very severe, 
involvement of 50–75% of cortex; 5 = extensive damage, involvement of 
more than 75% of the cortex.
Plasma biochemical analysis. The recovery of renal function was determined by measuring creatinine and ureum in plasma samples obtained 
after intervention by enzyme reactions involving urease and creatinase and 
using standard autoanalyzer methods by our hospital research services.
Statistics. Differences between groups were analyzed using Mann-Whitney 
U test. Values are expressed as mean ± SEM. A value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
