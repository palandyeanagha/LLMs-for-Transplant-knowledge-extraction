Abstract. Chronic inflammatory bone diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, periodontal disease and
aseptic periprosthetic osteolysis, are characterized by bone loss around affected joints and teeth caused
by increased osteoclastic bone resorption. This resorption is mediated largely by the increased local
production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFa). These cytokines may induce resorption indirectly by affecting the production of the essential osteoclast differentiation factor, receptor activator of NF-kB ligand, and/or its soluble decoy receptor, osteoprotegerin, by
osteoblast/stromal cells or directly by enhancing proliferation and/or activity of cells in the osteoclast
lineage. The importance of TNFa in the pathogenesis of various forms of bone loss is supported by
both experimental and clinical evidence. However, TNFa is not absolutely required for osteoclastogenesis, erosive arthritis, or osteolysis, as all these events could occur in the absence of TNFa and
whether TNFa promotes osteoclast formation independently of RANK signaling is still a topic of
debate. Here we review our current understanding of the mechanisms whereby TNFa increases osteoclastogenesis in vitro and in vivo. (Keio J Med 54 (3): 127–131, September 2005)

Regulation of Osteoclast Formation
Osteoclasts are multinucleated cells formed by fusion of mononuclear progenitors in the monocyte/
macrophage lineage derived from the colony-forming
units granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM). Considerable progress has been made in our understanding of
osteoclastogenesis through cell culture techniques,1 and
the generation of transgenic and knockout mice.2 These
studies have identified two distinct signaling pathways
whose activation is required for osteoclastogenesis.
The first is activated by macrophage-colony stimulating
factor (M-CSF), which signals through its receptor cFms, and the second by the ligand of receptor activator
of NF-kB (RANKL) through its receptor, RANK.3,4
Mice genetically deficient in M-CSF5,6 or RANKL7,8
signaling do not form osteoclasts and thus develop
osteopetrosis. Osteoclastogenesis is also dependent
on intracellular signaling molecules downstream from
c-Fms and RANK.9–
11 These include the adapter
protein, TRAF6,12,13 and the transcription factors,
AP-1,14,15 NF-kB16,17 and NFAT.18,19
The progression of osteoclast precursors through the
various stages of differentiation from the pluripotent
hematopoietic stem cell has been characterized by using
a combination of cell surface markers, cell sorting and
osteoclastogenesis assays.20 To date, the earliest identified osteoclast progenitor in bone marrow has been
phenotyped as a c-Kitþ/c-Fms/CD11b/RANK cell,
which then differentiates into a c-Kitþ/c-Fmsþ/CD11bþ/
RANK early stage progenitor. Stimulation of this
cell by M-CSF expressed by osteoblast/stromal cells in
the marrow advances differentiation to the c-Kit/cFmsþ/ CD11bþ/RANKþ late stage progenitor, which
responds to RANKL to complete osteoclast development. RANKL not only delivers a final differentiation
signal, but also activates osteoclasts and promotes their
survival.20–

TNF in Inflammatory Arthritis
TNFa, like many other osteoclast-stimulating molecules, promotes RANKL production by stromal cells,24
and also induces its secretion by T lymphocytes,25 B
lymphocytes,26 and endothelial cells27 to induce osteoclast formation indirectly. TNFa also stimulates MCSF production by murine or human stromal cells.28
Whether TNFa promotes osteoclast formation independently of RANK signaling has been a topic of
considerable debate. Two independent groups demonstrated that TNFa promotes osteoclast formation in
vitro despite RANK signaling blockade,29,30 while
others reported that ‘‘permissive’’ levels of RANKL are
required for TNFa-induced osteoclastogenesis.31 These
discrepant findings may reflect different cell populations
and culture conditions, but the observation that TNFa
can stimulate osteoclast formation from bone marrow
cells from RANK and RANKL knockout mice clearly
demonstrates RANKL/RANK independent osteoclastogenesis in vitro32 (and our unpublished observations).
Although small numbers of osteoclasts were reported
to form in vivo in response to high local concentrations
of TNF delivered locally over the calvarial bones of
RANK-/- mice, RANK independent osteoclastogenesis
under physiological conditions in vivo has not been
demonstrated. Thus, the relevance of this action of
TNFa in vitro to normal or diseased states remains
unclear.
To study the effects of chronic TNFa exposure on
osteoclast precursor differentiation and the requirement of RANKL/RANK signaling in this process, we
used TNFa transgenic (TNF-Tg) mice, which develop
erosive arthritis, and RANK knockout mice.33,34 In
TNF-Tg mice there is a chronic low-level expression of
the human TNFa transgene and as a result the mice
develop an erosive arthritis with features similar to
those seen in human rheumatoid arthritis (RA). These
features include inflammatory bone loss,35 most notably focal erosions affecting the immediate subchondral
bone and bone at the joint margins where osteoclast
numbers are increased (Fig. 1). Thus, the mechanisms
whereby TNFa induces osteoclast formation can be
studied using this model.
Osteoclast and CFU-GM colony formation is increased in cultures of spleen cells from TNF-Tg compared to wild-type mice. However, a more striking
finding is that mature osteoclasts are derived from
TNF-Tg splenocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMC) one day earlier than from wild-type cells.
This accelerated osteoclastogenesis could not be inhibited by TNF blockade in vitro, but was observed in cultures of splenocytes from wild-type mice injected previously with TNFa.34 From these data, we conclude
that TNFa has a priming effect on osteoclast progenitor
cells in vivo thereby increasing the number of preosteoclasts in peripheral tissues.
If our interpretation is correct, and systemic TNFa
increases the number of pre-osteoclasts in peripheral
tissues like the spleen and blood, then these cells should
be identifiable by phenotypic surface markers. FACS
analysis showed that spleens from TNF-Tg mice had
4 to 7-fold more CD11bþ cells than wild-type mice,
but TNFa had no effect on CD11b expression in preosteoclasts. Spleen cells isolated from TNFa-treated
mice proliferated faster in response to M-CSF compared to PBS-treated mice in vitro, but direct administration of TNFa to spleen cells did not affect their proliferation. Since osteoclast precursors differentiate from
myeloid progenitors in the bone marrow, we examined
their frequency in the bone marrow of TNF-Tg mice to
determine if chronic exposure to TNF alters the generation of pre-osteoclasts. Compared to their wild-type
littermate controls, TNF-Tg mice have significantly
increased CD11bþ pre-osteoclasts. Furthermore, TNF
treatment of bone marrow cells from wild-type mice
leads to an increase in the frequency of c-Fmsþ/
CD11bþ cells and increases c-Fms mRNA expression,
suggesting that TNF promotes the differentiation of
marrow osteoclast precursors thereby increasing the
pool size of these cells36 (Fig. 2). TNF treatment of
CD11bþc/Gr-1=low osteoclast precursors purified from
bone marrow by FACS analysis increased their c-fms
mRNA expression 4-fold, suggesting that these cells

express TNF receptors at this stage in their development (our unpublished observations). Whether these
pre-osteoclasts actively leave the bone marrow to go to
peripheral tissues and whether TNF affects this process
have yet to be determined.
Having demonstrated that transgenically-expressed
and exogenous TNFa increase peripheral pre-osteoclast
frequency, we examined if this increase was reversible
via in vivo TNFa blockade with the TNFa inhibitor, etanercept. This treatment reduced the number of CD11bþ
splenocytes, and their osteoclastogenic and CFU-GM
colony formation potential to wild-type levels. These
findings37 are consistent with our observation that
patients with RA and psoriatic arthritis have a marked
increase in the number of pre-osteoclasts in their PBMC
population compared to normal and osteoarthritis controls.38 Importantly, this increase also appears to be
reversible with anti-TNFa therapy, and may be a dominant mechanism by which this treatment inhibits erosions in these patients.
We previously investigated RANK-independent
osteoclastogenesis in animal models of wear debrisinduced osteolysis39 and fracture healing,40 but found
no osteoclast formation in the absence of RANK signaling. To investigate if the effects of chronic exposure
to TNFa are dependent on RANK signaling, we treated
TNF-Tg mice with a RANK antagonist, RANK: Fc (a
soluble fusion protein consisting of the extracellular
domain of RANK fused to the Fc domain of IgG19),
and crossed TNF-Tg mice with RANK-/- mice. We
found that CD11bþ cells increased in both models.
However, the elevated levels of TNFa did not compensate for the absence of RANK signaling because the
precursors were unable to differentiate into mature
osteoclasts. Furthermore, we found no erosions in mice
with established arthritis that had been treated with
RANK : Fc, which suggests that RANK blockade can
arrest erosive disease (our unpublished observations).
Thus, chronic exposure to TNFa in vivo increases
osteoclastogenesis through two distinct mechanisms
(Fig. 2) in which TNFa first affects osteoclastogenesis at
the osteoclast precursor stage in the bone marrow by
priming these cells to differentiate into c-Fmsþ/CD11bþ/
RANKþ= osteoclast progenitors via a RANKL/RANK
independent mechanism. These osteoclast precursors
then enter the blood and peripheral tissues where they
can respond to TNFa by both direct and indirect
mechanisms to become mature osteoclasts at sites of
bone resorption. For example, TNFa can induce a
variety of cells, including synovial cells, T cells and
osteoblast/stromal cells, to increase their expression of
RANKL, which binds to RANK on the surface of these
precursors and induces their differentiation. TNFa can
also bind to its receptor on the surface of these precursors and directly induce their differentiation to mature osteoclasts, thus enhancing the RANKL-induced
indirect action. The dominance of RANK blockade in
the model in Figure 2 is consistent with results from
other animal models of arthritis,41,42 osteoporosis,22
hypercalcemia of malignancy43,44 and tumor metastasis
to bone.45 These findings suggest a clinical correlate
whereby patients with active erosive arthritis might
have increased numbers of CD11bþ cells with enhanced
osteoclastogenic potential in their blood. It is possible
that patients with active disease or ‘‘flares,’’ could be
identified by an increase in circulating pre-osteoclasts.
Furthermore, it is possible that patients that are nonresponsive or refractory to anti-TNF therapy could
be identified by changes in this population following
therapy.
Fig. 2 RANK dependent and independent mechanisms of TNF-mediated osteoclastogenesis. During the early stages of osteoclastogenesis,
TNF increases the pool size of marrow osteoclast precursors by promoting their proliferation and differentiation in response to M-CSF and by
stimulating c-Fms expression, which is independent of the RANK pathway. These osteoclast precursors then differentiate into mature osteoclasts in the presence of RANKL, and this process is accelerated by TNF. The role of TNF at this later stage of osteoclast differentiation is
RANKL/RANK dependent.
