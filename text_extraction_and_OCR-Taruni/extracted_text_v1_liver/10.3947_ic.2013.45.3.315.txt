Background: Bloodstream infection (BSI) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in liver transplant (LT) recipients. This study 
aimed to investigate the epidemiology and clinical features of post-transplant BSI in LT recipients.
Materials and Methods: The microbiology, frequency, and outcome of post-transplant BSI in the first year after LT were retrospectively analyzed in 222 consecutive patients who had received liver transplants at a single center between 2005 and 2011. The risk factors 
for post-transplant BSI and death were evaluated. 
Results: During a 1-year period after LT, 112 episodes of BSI occurred in 64 of the 222 patients (28.8%). A total of 135 microorganisms were isolated from 112 BSI episodes including 18 polymicrobial episodes. The median time to BSI onset ranged from 
8 days for Klebsiella pneumoniae to 101 days for enterococci, and the overall median for all microorganisms was 28 days. The 
most frequent pathogens were Enterobacteriaceae members (32.5%), enterococci (17.8%), yeasts (14.0%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.3%), and Acinetobacter baumannii (10.3%); most of them showed resistance to major antibiotics. The major sources of 
BSI were biliary tract (36.2%), abdominal and/or wound (28.1%), and intravascular catheter (18.5%) infections. The independent risk factors for post-transplant BSI were biliary complications (odds ratio [OR]: 2.91, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.29 
to 6.59, P=0.010) and longer hospitalization in the intensive care unit (OR: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.00 to 1.08, P < 0.001) after LT. 
BSI was an independent risk factor for death (hazard ratio [HR]: 3.92, 95% CI: 2.22 to 6.91, P < 0.001), with a poorer survival 
rate observed in patients with BSI than in those without BSI (1-year survival rate: 60.0% versus 89.5%, respectively, P < 0.001) 
after LT. The strongest predictors for death in patients with BSI were hepatocellular carcinoma (HR: 3.82, 95% CI: 1.57 to 9.32, 
P=0.003), candidemia (HR: 3.71, 95% CI: 1.58 to 8.71, P=0.003), polymicrobial bacteremia (HR: 3.18, 95% CI: 1.39 to 7.28, 
P=0.006), and post-transplant hemodialysis (HR: 2.44, 95% CI: 1.02 to 5.84, P=0.044).
Conclusions: BSI was a frequent post-transplant complication, and most of the causative pathogens were multi-drug resistant. 
Biliary complications and BSIs resulting from biliary infection are major problems for LT recipients. The prevention of BSI and 
biliary complications is critical in improving prognosis in liver transplant recipients.

Introduction
Liver transplantation (LT) is a life-saving treatment for end 
stage liver disease. Despite improved graft survival owing to 
recent advances in perioperative management and surgical 
techniques, mortality and morbidity rates associated with 
perioperative infection in LT recipients remain relatively high 
[1-3]. Bloodstream infection (BSI) is the most frequent infectious complication, with an incidence range of 24-49%; BSI is 
a significant predictor of post-transplant death [2, 4-6]. Some 
studies have suggested that gram-positive (GP) cocci are the 
major pathogens of post-transplant BSI. However, others have 
implicated gram-negative (GN) bacilli as the predominant 
pathogens. Furthermore, multi-drug resistance (MDR) rates 
among GN bacilli have been increasing, further affecting the 
prognosis of LT recipients [4, 7-11].
Understanding the epidemiology of and the risk factors associated with post-transplant BSI may facilitate identification 
of high-risk patients, guide appropriate initiation of antibiotic 
therapy, and improve infection control practices. In this retrospective analysis, 222 consecutive patients who underwent LT 
were studied to assess the epidemiology and clinical significance of BSI in the year following LT.
Materials and Methods
1. Patient enrollment
Over a 6-year period from February 2005 to May 2011, 231 
LT were performed in 222 patients at Ajou University Hospital, 
a university-affiliated, 1,087-bed tertiary-care institute in Korea. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of these 
222 liver transplant recipients. Deceased donor LT has been 
performed at this institute since 1995 and adult living donor 
LT since 2005. ABO-incompatible LT began in March 2007, 
and 11 ABO-incompatible LTs were performed during the 
study period [11].
2. Cultures
Microbiological surveillance cultures were routinely done 
after LT. Blood cultures were obtained by standard procedures 
and processed by an automated system. The automats used 
were the BacT/ALERT 3D system (bioMérieux, Durham, NC, 
USA) and the BACTEC FX system (BD Diagnostic Systems, 
USA) for rapid microbial detection. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the minimal inhibitory concentration 
agar dilution method according to the recommendations of 
the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. 
3. Antimicrobial prophylaxis
Initial antimicrobial prophylaxis was cefoperazone/sulbactam until January 2007 and piperacillin/tazobactam subsequently. Vancomycin was routinely administered to prevent 
methicillin-resistant staphylococcal infections. For fungal prophylaxis, amphotericin B deoxycholate was used until December 2009, but it was replaced by liposomal amphotericin B in 
January 2010. The above antimicrobial regimen continued for 
approximately 5-7 days after LT. Intravenous ganciclovir followed by oral acyclovir or oral valacyclovir was used for cytomegalovirus prophylaxis. Pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis consisted of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and was 
continued for 1 year after LT. Selective bowel decontamination with oral neomycin was performed for recipients of elective living donor LT. Patients who received liver transplants for 
hepatitis B associated liver cirrhosis were managed with antiviral prophylaxis and hepatitis B immunoglobulin.
4. Immunosuppression 
Primary standard immunosuppressive therapy included tacrolimus (FK506) or cyclosporine, basiliximab, and low-dose 
prednisone. Rejection episodes were mainly treated with 
high-dose methylprednisolone and by increasing tacrolimus 
blood concentrations. 
5. Definitions
Infections were defined using the criteria proposed by the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [12]. BSI was defined as the isolation of a pathogenic microorganism from at 
least 1 blood culture specimen. Skin flora organisms commonly associated with contamination were required to be isolated 
from 2 separate blood culture specimens. Polymicrobial BSI 
was defined as the isolation of > 2 organisms from a single 
blood culture specimen, and each organism was considered a 
separate isolate in the analysis. Multiple cultures that were 
positive for the same pathogen constituted a single BSI episode if they were not separated by > 2 weeks and the patient 
did not recover with negative blood culture in the interim. PreLT antibiotic therapy was defined as the application of broadspectrum antibiotics for > 5 days in the month before LT. The 
definition of MDR bacteria was based on previous studies [13].
6. Statistical analysis
Statistical calculations were performed using the SPSS Advanced Statistics Modules, version 20.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, 

www.icjournal.org http://dx.doi.org/10.3947/ic.2013.45.3.315 • Infect Chemother 2013;45(3):315-324 317
USA). Continuous data normally distributed, are expressed as 
mean (SD) and analyzed using the Student's t-test. All other 
continuous data not normally distributed are presented as 
median (interquartile range) and analyzed using the MannWhitney U-test.
The risk factors for BSI were examined by multiple logistic 
regression analysis. A cox regression model was used to identify independent risk factors for mortality in patients with BSI 
and all patients. Kaplan-Meier statistics were used to generate 
survival curves for patients with and without BSI. All P-values 
were 2-tailed, and a P-value < 0.05 was considered significant. 
Results
1. Characteristics of the study population
The basic demographic and clinical characteristics of the 
222 LT recipients are illustrated in Table 1. The mean age was 
49 years and three-quarters of patients were men. The most 
frequent liver diseases leading to LT were B-viral liver cirrhosis 
(76.6%, 170 patients), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; 47.7%, 
106 patients), and alcoholic liver cirrhosis (26.1%, 58 patients); 
≥ 2 of these diseases overlapped in some patients. Because of 
the small number of other diagnoses leading to LT, only hepatitis B associated liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, 
and alcoholic liver cirrhosis were analyzed as diagnostic pretransplant variables. The study population included 33 recipients who underwent salvage LT for tumor recurrence or liver 
function deterioration after partial hepatectomy. Eight patients underwent a second LT for primary (n=2) or secondary 
graft failure (n=6). The median Child-Pugh score was 10 and the 
mean model for end stage liver disease (MELD) score was 16.

cipients in the year after LT. A total of 135 bacterial and fungal 
organisms were isolated from the 112 BSI episodes including 
18 polymicrobial BSIs. Thirteen patients had ≥ 1 polymicrobial 
BSI. One BSI occurred in 38 of 64 patients, whereas multiple 
episodes of BSI occurred in the remaining 26 patients, ranging 
from 1 to 9 episodes per patient. The median follow-up period 
was 1,306 (range 2-2,803) days.
Figure 1 shows the isolated time and frequency of pathogenic microorganisms in BSIs during the year after transplantation. Most of the BSIs (50.8%; 57 of 112) occurred in the first 
month after LT. The median time to BSI onset after LT was 28 
days (dashed line) with an interquartile range (IQR) of 6-89 
days; the mean time to onset was 57 ± 69 days (solid line). GP 
cocci, GN bacilli, and fungi were responsible for 32.8%, 52.9%, 
and 14.0% of isolated organisms in BSIs, respectively. The mediantime to onset of BSI episode from the date of transplantation (day 0) for each group of pathogens was day 40 (IQR: 19-
113) for GP cocci (n = 44), day 23 (IQR: 6-66) for GN bacilli 
(n=71), and day 12 (IQR: 5-95) for fungi (n=19).
3. Causative pathogens and source of BSI
The distribution of species is illustrated in Table 2. Enterobacteriaceae members represented the majority of GN isolates, 
with the most frequent species being Klebsiella pneumoniae 
and Escherichia coli. Among GP organisms, Enterococcus faecium was the most common, followed by Both GP and GN 
pathogens showed a high rate of resistance to major antibiotics: 92.8% of S. aureus were methicillin-resistant; 38.0% of E. 
faecium were vancomycin-resistant; 68.4% of K. pneumoniae 
and 82.3% of E. coli produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL); and 92.8% of Acinetobacter baumannii and 
91.6% of were carbapenem-resistant. However, neither linezolid-resistant enterococc or carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were identified. Candida species accounted for 
14.0% (19 of 135) of all isolates, and approximately 50% of 
these (10 of 19) were non-albicans species. All Candida species were susceptible to fluconazole.
The primary sources and time to onset of BSIs according to 
each isolated pathogen are listed in Table 3. BSIs caused by K. 
pneumoniae tended to occur early (median: 8 days, IQR: 4-83 
days), whereas enterococcal BSIs developed later (median: 
101 days, IQR: 24-153 days). The most common source was 
biliary tract infection (36.2%), followed by abdominal and/or 
wound (28.1%) and intravascular catheter (18.5%) infections. 
Enterococcemia or Enterobacteriaceae bacteremia from biliary tract or abdominal and/or wound infections was the most 
frequent type of BSI. The primary pathogens of catheter-related BSIs were Candida and A. baumannii. Polymicrobial BSIs 
predominantly consisted of enterococci, staphylococci, and 
Candida species, and most of them originated from the biliary 
tract.
4. Risk factors for post-transplant BSI
The clinical and operative variables associated with posttransplant BSI are illustrated in Table 4. Patients with BSIs 
were significantly more likely to have post-transplant hemodialysis, reoperative or retransplantation episodes, higher ChildPugh score and MELD score, more transfusion during surgery, 
longer postoperative intensive care unit (ICU) stay and admission days, and more biliary complications. In logistic regression analysis, biliary complications (odds ratio [OR]: 2.91, 95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 1.29 to 6.59, P = 0.010) and longer

ICU stay (OR: 1.040, 95% CI: 1.002 to 1.080, P = 0.038) were 
significant independent risk factors of post-transplant BSI 
(Table 5).
5. Survival curve and predictors for death in LT 
recipients
The mortality rate in LT recipients with BSI was higher than 
that in those without BSI in both the early (30-day mortality: 
22.9% vs. 5.9%) and late (1-year mortality: 40.0% vs. 10.5%) 
postoperative periods. Survival time (mean ± SD) was significantly lower in patients with BSI (1,310 ± 147 days; 1-year survival rate 60.0%) than in those without BSI (2,362 ± 77 days; 
1-year survival rate 89.5%) throughout the 1-year post-transplant period and beyond 1 year after LT (< 0.001) (Fig. 2).
In those with BSI, a fungal BSI was associated with the poorest 1-year survival rate (fungal BSI 35.7% vs. non-fungal BSI 
66.1%). LT recipients with polymicrobial BSI also had a significantly lower 1-year survival rate than those with BSI caused 
by a single pathogen (polymicrobial BSI 26.7% vs. monomicrobial BSI 69.1%).
Significant predictors of mortality in the entire study population were BSI (hazard ratio [HR]: 3.92, 95% CI: 2.22 to 6.91, P 
< 0.001), post-transplant hemodialysis (HR: 3.38, 95% CI: 1.70 
to 6.70, P < 0.001), comorbid HCC (HR: 2.14, 95% CI: 1.20 to 
3.82, P=0.009), and longer ICU stay after LT (HR: 1.024, 95% 
CI: 1.002 to 1.047, P=0.030). In those patients with BSI, Candida BSI (HR: 3.71, 95% CI: 1.58 to 8.71, P=0.003) and polymiTable 3. Source of bloodstream infection and time to onset in the year following liver transplantation

crobial BSI (HR: 3.18, 95% CI: 1.39-7.28, P=0.006), in particular, were independent risk factors for post-transplant death 
(Table 6). 
Discussion
We found that BSI is a common complication for LT recipients: 28.8% of our patients developed at least 1 BSI episode inthe year following transplantation. In our study population, 
the rate of BSI episodes and the overall 1-year mortality rate 
after LT were higher than those reported by other investigators [2, 5, 14, 15]. The greater number of BSIs and the higher 
mortality rate in this study can be partly explained by the poor 
general condition of our LT recipients, whose median MELD 
scores (16) and Child-Pugh scores (10) were relatively high. A 
learning curve effect, by including in the sample those patients from the early period of our living donor LT program (a 
highly complex technique), might also have contributed to the 
increased rates of mortality and postoperative infectious complications in the early transplant period [16, 17]. 
Previous studies show that factors associated with postTable 4. Characteristics associated with bloodstream infection by univariate analysis

transplant BSI include diabetes mellitus, low serum albumin 
level, lengthy ICU stay, reoperations, acute rejection, higher 
MELD score, intraoperative transfusion, biliary complication, 
older age, post-transplant hemodialysis, and a greater number 
of intravascular catheter days [2, 5, 9, 15]. In this study, biliary 
complication was a particularly important risk factor for BSI: 
42% of LT recipients with biliary complication developed BSI. 
Biliary leak age or biliary stricture was a major postoperative 
complication, with an incidence of 10-15% in deceased donor 
LT and 15-30% in living donor LT [14, 18]. Biliary infections 
need to be studied further given the clinical significance of 
biliary-origin BSI in LT recipients.
BSI episodes were predominantly caused by GN bacilli, 
which accounted for 52.9% of all isolates. Consistent with other studies, we found that GN infections with increased MDR 
were common [8, 9, 15, 19, 20]. The microbial etiology of BSI 
varied according to the time to onset [21]. During the early period, GN bacilli including K. pneumoniae, E. coli, and A. baumannii were more frequent causes of BSIs. In the late posttransplant period, biliary-origin enterococcemia was the most 
frequent type of BSI. Other common BSI sources were abdominal and/or wound K. pneumoniae infection and intravascular catheter infection with Candida species or A. baumannii. It is concerning that catheter-related BSI, which is 
exclusively nosocomial, accounted for one-fifth of post-transplant BSIs. Further identification of BSI characteristics would 
aid physicians in determining the potential etiology of posttransplant BSI.
MDR pathogens accounted for the vast majority of all GN 
and GP bacteremia cases in this study. It was reported that resistant Acinetobacter infection has a particularly poor prognosis in LT recipients [22] and that early definite therapy seemed 
to influence outcomes [23]. However, therapeutic options for 
these organisms are often limited, expensive, and of low efficacy. Approximately one-third of enterococci showed vancomycin resistance. It is possible that our perioperative prophylaxis with vancomycin may have prevented more cases of GP 
BSI; however, it was not optimal in preventing infections 
caused by vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), and may 
have contributed to the development of resistant organisms. 
Although VRE is known to be a less-virulent pathogen, VRE 
colonization in LT recipients has been associated with higher 
mortality rates regardless of the cause of death [11]. Extensive 
exposure to broad spectrum antibiotics in the pretransplant 
phase could also have influenced the increased incidence of 
MDR organisms. We believe that prospective studies are 
needed to help design strategies for the prevention of infection with these MDR pathogens and to find the optimal antibiotic prophylaxis and empirical treatment in LT.

post-transplant mortality, and recipients with BSI had poorer 
survival throughout the postoperative period than those without BSI. HCC, post-transplant hemodialysis, and prolonged 
ICU stay were independent risk factors for mortality in patients with BSI as well as for mortality in all patients. Many of 
our LT recipients had HCC (47.7%; 106 of 222 patients), and 
45% of HCC cases were in an advanced stage beyond Milan 
criteria with a history of antitumor therapy when LT was performed. A deteriorated condition resulting from advanced 
cancer and the complexity of the surgery because of previous 
invasive therapy may have resulted in more postoperative 
complications and poor oncologic outcomes in these patients.
Approximately one-third of our LT recipients underwent hemodialysis after LT. It has been reported that post-transplant 
renal dysfunction occurs in 9-33% of LT recipients and is associated with increased mortality, especially when renal replacement therapy is required [24]. Our preoperative prophylaxis regimen included routine use of glycopeptide, 
amphotericin B, and ganciclovir, all of which are known to be 
nephrotoxic; this might have played a role in increasing the 
rate of post-transplant renal dysfunction. Since many LT candidates with end stage liver diseases also have marginal renal 
function, efforts to limit nephrotoxic medication are necessary. 
BSI caused by Candida and polymicrobial BSI were significant predictors of death. One-third of candidemia cases were 
polymicrobial with synchronous bacteremia or other species 
of Candida. Candidemia and polymicrobial bacteremia may 
be indicators of a generally debilitated state associated with 
increased morbidity and mortality [25, 26]. In this study, both 
candidemia and polymicrobial bacteremia most frequently 
originated in the biliary tract or intravascular catheter. Patients 
with candidemia or polymicrobial bacteremia may need 
prompt initiation of antifungal therapy, more empirical antibacterial coverage, and active intervention such as the removal of intravascular catheters. Because of concerns over drug 
interactions, azole-associated hepatotoxicity, and antifungal 
drug resistance, amphotericin B was used for antifungal prophylaxis at our institute. However, the use of amphotericin B 
needs to be evaluated, given the high frequency of renal dysfunction, candidemia, and associated mortality observed in 
our study.
LT recipients with underlying chronic hepatitis B had better 
prognosis after LT in our study. United Network for Organ 
Sharing (UNOS) data show that, thanks to advances in antiviral therapies, recipients with hepatitis B have better posttransplant outcomes than those with hepatitis C, hepatitis B 
and C coinfection, and those with other liver diseases [27]. 
Our study has limitations because of its retrospective design, 
single-center study, and small sample size; therefore, our findings may not be generalizable to other institutes. BSI episodes 
caused by GP cocci may have been under-reported because 
we used strict criteria when interpreting blood culture results 
to rule out contaminants. The impact of BSI on post-LT mortality may also have been over-represented, since patients 
with BSI often had severe pre-LT status when compared with 
those without BSI. Because the main source of infection and 
the depth of infection were difficult to determine, surgical 
wound infections and abdominal organ/space infections were 
combined into a single infectious source in our study. A more 
sophisticated classification system should be used in future 
studies. Possible correlations between the antibiotics received 
by LT recipients and their subsequent infections including 
BSIs were not evaluated. 
As a conclusion, Post-transplant BSI occurred at a high rate 
during the year after LT, particularly within the month following surgery. Patients with BSI had a significantly lower survival 
rate than those without BSI. GN bacilli were more frequent 
than GP cocci as BSI pathogens, and most of them were highly 
drug resistant. Biliary complication was the strongest predictor for BSI, and BSIs resulting from biliary infection were major problems for LT recipients. Prevention of BSI and biliary 
complication is important for improving prognosis in liver 
transplant recipients. BSIs caused by fungi and polymicrobial 
BSIs in particular were strongly associated with increased 
mortality. Our study provides detailed information on posttransplant BSI occurrence, and the data can be used to guide 
empirical antimicrobial therapy and improve infection control 
practices.
