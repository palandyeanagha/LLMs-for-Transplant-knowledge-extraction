Summary. Purified islets of Langerhans and a kidney were 
transplanted into a 36-year-old patient who suffered from 
renal failure secondary to a 25 year history of Type 1 (insulindependent) diabetes mellitus. The islet graft contained 
243 000 fresh islets (mean islet diameter 150 gm) that were 
syngeneic with the kidney graft and 368 000 cryopreserved islets that had been collected from four other donors. The total 
of 10 000 islets/kg body weight was infused into the liver via 
the umbilical vein. Immunosuppression was induced with 
antilymphocyte globulin and maintained with prednisone, 
cyclosporine and azathioprine. Serum C-peptide levels 
(ng/ml) during fasting and after standard mixed meal feeding 
(Sustacal) were < 0.12 preoperatively. Postoperatively, insulin secretion was restored: fasting C-peptide rose during 
the first 4 weeks to levels of 4 to 5 and Sustacal elicited a further rise to 6 to 7. Transplant renal function was stable. Daily 
fasting glucose (mmol/1, mean + SD) was 5.6 + i and 5.3 _+ 0.6 
during the first and second months respectively and postSustacal glucose was 5.7 + 0.8. Exogenous insulin therapy 
was progressively withdrawn and stopped during the ninth 
week. Thereafter, fasting glucose was 4.7 + 0.5, 24 h mean 
glucose was 6.6 + 0.5, and normoglycaemia was maintained 
after Sustacal. These data show that this mass of freshly isolated and cryopreserved islets from multiple donors provided sustained function (3 months) that reversed insulindependence in an immunosuppressed Type 1 diabetic 
patient treated with simultaneous islet-kidney transplantation. 
Key words: Pancreatic islet transplantation, cryopreservation, Type i (insulin-dependent) diabetes, tissue bank. 
Several advances have made it feasible to initiate a clinical 
trial of pancreatic islet transplantation for Type 1 (insulindependent) diabetes mellitus in our research centre. Mass 
isolation of purified human islets has improved significantly [1, 2] and dose response studies have defined the 
critical mass of autogenous or allogeneic islet tissue 
needed to reverse Type i diabetes in dogs treated with 
cyclosporine (CsA) [3]. Initial clinical transplants using a 
similar islet mass resulted in sustained insulin production, 
however, exogenous insulin therapy could not be withdrawn [4], suggesting that an increased Beta-cell mass is 
needed in human subjects with long-term diabetes. An approach to this problem is to collect and store islets in a 
tissue bank until sufficient donor tissue is available to treat 
an individual recipient, such as storage of islets by 
cryopreservation [5]. The present report details the results 
of transplantation of a combination of freshly-isolated 
and cryopreserved islets from multiple human donors into 
a Type I diabetic patient. 
Subjects and methods 
Patient 
A 36-year-old woman had Type 1 diabetes resulting in proliferative 
retinopathy, neuropathy and end-stage nephropathy. Insulin therapy of 0.6 U/kg was required daily before onset of clinical nephropathy. Serum C-peptide was 0.12 ng/ml during fasting and did not rise 
after Sustacal or glucagon. Haemoglobin AlC was 0.061 one month 
preoperatively. Procedures were performed with informed consent 
from the patient and in accordance with principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. 
Islet isolation 
Human pancreases were recovered from adult cadaver organ donors 
at teaching hospitals affiliated with the University of Alberta. The 
pancreases were removed before in situ flush and processed within 
2 h by collagenase ductal perfusion, gentle dissociation and Ficoll

gradient purification [1]. To assess islet quantity, aliquots of the purified suspension were stained with dithizone [6] and examined at 
microscopy immediately before transplantation. The number of 
islets was counted within each size range of 60-99 gin, 100-199 gin, 
200-299 gin, 300-399 gm and > 400 gm and converted to a number 
of islets equivalent to a diameter of 150 gin. Purity for insulin-containing islets was estimated by comparing the relative proportions of 
dithizone-stained and unstained tissue. Functional viability was assessed by perifusion in Krebs' ringer bicarbonate buffer supplemented with 3.3 mmol/1 glucose for i h, then with 27.7 mmol/1 
glucose for 1 h, followed by an additional hour at 3.3 mmol/1. Perifusate was collected and assayed for insulin content by radioimmunoassay using kits (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). 
Islet cryopreservation 
Islets were cryopreserved according to the protocol of Rajotte [5]. 
Briefly, aliquots of 10000 islets were incubated in dimethylsulfoxide 
at increasing concentrations of 0.66, 1 and 2 mol/1, then supercooled 
to - 7.6 ~ Following ice nucleation and release of latent heat of fusion, controlled cooling of 0.25 ~ was used from -10~ to 
- 40 ~ then the islets were plunged into liquid nitrogen ( - 196 ~ 
for storage from 6 months to 1 year. Immediately before transplantation, they were thawed rapidly (150 ~ and the cryoprotectant removed using a sucrose dilution (0.75 mol/1). 
Transplant procedure 
A silastic catheter was inserted via the umbilical vein when the kidney transplant was completed. The tip of the catheter was advanced 
to the left portal vein and secured. Twenty-four hours later, the freshly isolated and frozen-thawed islets were each suspended in medium 199. Each was infused via the catheter while portal venous 
pressure was monitored. Immunosuppression was induced with a 
10 day course of Minnesota antilymphoblast globulin (MALG) and 
maintained with azathioprine, prednisone and CsA. 
Patient monitoring and follow-up 
During the first 14 postoperative days, insulin was infused intravenously to maintain capillary blood glucose as measured by test strips 
G. L. Warnock et al.: Clinical islet transplantation 
(Glucometer, Miles Canada Inc., Etobicoke, Ontario, Canada) between 4 and 7 mmol/1. During subsequent weeks, subcutaneous insulin was administered in decreasing doses to maintain similar glycaemic levels. Fasting serum glucose and C-peptide concentrations 
were measured dally postoperatively for 14 days, then 3 to 4 times 
weekly. At weekly intervals insulin therapy was withheld after 
18.00 hours and C-peptide was measured after an 8 to 12 h overnight 
fast and 90 rain after 360 ml of oral Sustacal (Mead-Johnson, Evansville, Ind., USA). At 69 days after islet transplantation, insulin therapy was stopped and glucose tolerance and C-peptide responses 
were measured for 4 h after Sustacal. C-peptide was measured by 
radioimmunoassay using kits (Incstar, Stillwater, Minn., USA). 
Results 
Fresh islets syngeneic with the donor kidney provided a 
dose of 4000islets (volume 7.1 gl)/kg recipient body 
weight. Cryopreserved islets from four other donors provided 6072 islets (10.8 gl)/kg. Microscopic examination of 
the graft revealed a composition of 75% dithizone-positive tissue and the packed tissue volume was 2.5 ml. Portal 
venous pressure remained constant during islet infusion. 
HLA matching for the fresh islets showed that four 
antigens were matched with the recipient. For the 
cryopreserved islets, two donors had a one antigen match, 
one donor had a two antigen match, and one had no 
shared antigens. In no instance was an HLA-DR antigen 
shared. Donors and recipient were seropositive for cytomegalovirus. 
The responses of donor islets to perifusate glucose are 
shown in Fig. 1. Fresh and cryopreserved islets showed a 
three-fold rise in first phase insulin release, from 0.15 to 
0.51 gU. islet- 1. min- ~ and from 0.19 to 0.71 respectively. 
Second phase secretion was higher and more sustained in 
the fresh islets. Insulin levels returned to basal when the 
glucose concentration was reduced. 
Postoperative immunosuppression and graft function 
during the first month are detailed in Figure 2 a. MALG 
was initially given for 10 days, followed by CsA (whole 
blood trough levels 300-400 ng/ml). Azathioprine was 
maintained at 2 mg- kg- 1. day- ~ and prednisone at 0.5 to 
0.6 mg. kg- 1. day- 1. Islet function (serum C-peptide level) 
was detected immediately after islet implantation. Fasting 
C-peptide levels (ng/ml) rose progressively to 4 to 5 and stabilized at this level. Simultaneous mean ( + SD) fasting glucose was 5.6 + 1 mmol/1. At weekly intervals, Sustacal 
elicited further increases in C-peptide, with peak values of 
7.1 at 3 and 4 weeks (corresponding glucose 6.4). Insulin 
dosage (IU. kg- 1day- 1) were progressively reduced from 
2.2 before the transplant to 0.71. Mean daily glucose values 
obtained by blood glucose monitoring ranged from 5.5 to 
8.1. Renal transplant function was stable with serum creatinine < 100 gmol/lafter day 5,exceptforaslightincrease 
when CsA level exceeded 400 ng/ml. 
During the second month (Fig. 2b), the dosages of immunosuppressive drugs were tapered. Fasting C-peptide 
levels were 3 to 5 (simultaneous glucose 5.3 + 0.6) and 
stimulated C-peptide levels were 4 to 6 (simultaneous glucose 5.7 + 0,7). Insulin therapy was further reduced to 
0.25 IU. kg-1day-~. During this time, glucose monitoring 
showed mean 24 h levels ranging from 5.3-8.2. Renal 
transplant function remained stable.

During the third month (Fig. 2 c), fasting serum glucose ranged from 4.2 to 5.6 and 24 h mean glucose was 
from 5.8 to 7.5. Serum HbA~c was normal at 0.04. At 
69 days after islet transplantation, insulin therapy was discontinued. Thereafter, mean fasting glucose was 4.7 + 0.5 
and 24 h glucose remained at 5.4 to 7.5 for 3 weeks (the 
time of this manuscript). Serum glucose values for 4 h 
after oral Sustacal at 65 days after transplantation ranged 
from 4.9 to 6.7 (C-peptide 3.2 to 4.9). Repeat assays at 
77 days revealed glucose levels of 5.2 to 6.3 (corresponding C-peptide 3.6 to 5.3). 
Discussion 
Eleven cases of synchronous kidney-islet transplantation 
from human cadaver donors into immunosuppressed 
diabetic patients have been reported. A single adult recipient was reported by Largiader and associates to have 
stopped insulin therapy after implantation of 200,000 unpurified islets into the spleen [7]. That report did not document the preoperative insulin dependent status and postoperative islet function according to C-peptide levels. In 
further studies from our laboratory, a total of 250,000 purified islets provided prolonged Beta-cell secretion but this 
was insufficient to eliminate insulin therapy [4]. Compared with these earlier studies, a similar quantity of 
freshly isolated islets were also implanted in the present 
patient who was able to discontinue insulin therapy. These 
findings suggest that the additional Beta-cell function was 
at least partly attributable to the increased islet mass provided by the 368,000 cryopreserved islets, but further 
studies will be needed to verify this observation. 
The present data compares favourably with that of 
Scharp et al. [8] who transplanted islets into a patient who 
did not receive a synchronous kidney transplant or prolonged steroid immunosuppression. Despite the larger 
islet mass used by Scharp et al., C-peptide levels were 
lower, and the glucose levels were higher than those observed in the present patient. The duration of insulin independence in their patient was 12 days. 
Serum C-peptide levels in the present patient exceeded those observed in normal subjects and are similar 
to levels observed in non-diabetic recipients of renal allografts or diabetic recipients of vascularized pancreas allografts who are rendered insulin-independent [9]. These 
higher C-peptide levels, in the face of normal renal transplant function, are consistent with a degree of insulin resistance attributable to glucocorticoid therapy. 
We administered exogenous insulin immediately after 
islet transplantation in order to minimize the potential for 
hyperglycaemia associated with the insulin resistant state 
created by immunosuppressive therapy, including high 
doses of glucocorticoids. However, insulin requirements 
were found to decrease progressively as immunosuppressive drugs were tapered, until at 69 days, insulin therapy could be completely withdrawn and normoglycaemia 
was maintained. Whereas we cannot state whether administration of insulin to avoid hyperglycaemia and uncontrolled diabetes selwed to protect the islet graft, others have 
reported that the diabetic state caused impaired blood 
perfusion of islet grafts [10]. Recent studies in our laboraG. L. Warnock et al.: Clinical islet transplantation 
tory with purified islet allografts in dogs (unpublished observations) suggest that the function of frozen-thawed 
grafts is improved when hyperglycaemia is avoided. 
In summary, this report documents sustained 
(3 month) function of a combined graft of freshly-isolated 
and cryopreserved human islets that induced normoglycaemia and insulin-independence after transplantation 
into a Type 1 diabetic patient. This represents an essential 
preliminary step to evaluate the efficacy of this therapy for 
treatment of serious complications of diabetes.
