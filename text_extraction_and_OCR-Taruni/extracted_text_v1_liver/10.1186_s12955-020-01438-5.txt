Abstract
Background: Rare diseases may be life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions. Patient care needs are
often complex and challenging to coordinate and deliver effectively. Rare diseases and their clinical management
may therefore substantially impact on patients’ health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The use of patient-reported
outcome measures (PROMs) may complement clinical assessments by elucidating patients’ perspectives on their
health status and care priorities. This study explored the opinions of patients and clinicians on the use of PROMs in
the management of patients with rare diseases in routine clinical practice.
Methods: A total of 15 semi-structured one-to-one interviews were conducted with four patients with primary
sclerosing cholangitis (PSC); five renal transplant recipients; and six PSC doctors from University Hospitals
Birmingham (UHB) NHS Foundation Trust. A focus group session was also conducted with 10 clinical staff members
(doctors, nurses and other allied health professionals from UHB). The suitability and acceptability of the Chronic
Liver Disease Questionnaire (CLDQ) and the Short Form 12 (SF12) were assessed by patients with PSC and their
doctors while the Paediatric quality of life inventory Transplant Module (PedsQL-TM) and the EuroQoL-5 dimensions
(EQ. 5D) were evaluated by the renal transplant recipients and their doctors. The discussions were audio recorded
and transcribed verbatim. Coding of the transcripts was done using the Nvivo 11 Plus software. Thematic analysis
was conducted to identify the main themes and subthemes.

Results: Four themes were identified, namely: (i) potential benefits of PROMs in the management of rare diseases;
(ii) views on selected questionnaires; (iii) practical considerations for implementation; and (iv) potential facilitators
and barriers of implementation. Patients and clinicians suggested that the use of ePROMs may facilitate patientcentred care by promoting patient-clinician communication, highlighting aspects of HRQOL that are important to
patients and encouraging patient involvement in their care. They also felt that the disease-specific CLDQ and
PedsQL-TM were more relevant than the generic SF12 and EQ-5D.
Conclusions: Patients with rare diseases often experience impaired HRQOL. The use of an ePROM system may
enhance the routine management of patients with rare diseases.

Background
According to the European Union criterion, a ‘rare’ disease is one that has a prevalence of 5 or less cases per
10,000 of the general population; while in the United
States, a disease is considered ‘rare’ if it affects less than
200,000 people [1, 2]. In the UK, it is estimated that over
three million people will be affected by a rare disease at
some point in their lives [2]. Due to the small numbers
of patients living with each type of rare disease, there is
often limited awareness, knowledge and experience of
managing those with the condition [2, 3].
Given these challenges, capturing the perspectives of patients with rare diseases is particularly important as it may
provide a better picture of patients’ health status and the
outcomes of care they value. This information could assist
with the prioritization of care outcomes [4]. Patient perspectives may be captured using patient-reported outcomes (PROs): defined as “any report of the status of a
patient’s health condition that comes directly from the patient, without interpretation of the patient’s response by a
clinician or anyone else.” [5] PRO data is captured using
questionnaires known as patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) [5]. By providing patients’ perspectives of
their health status, the use of PROMs may facilitate a better understanding of the physical and psychosocial impact
of disease and treatment on patients’ health-related quality
of life (HRQOL) and symptoms [4, 6]. Ideally, PROMs
should be developed with patients and clinicians using a
combination of qualitative and quantitative methods. An
initial long form which addresses all relevant domains is
usually generated through literature reviews and discussions with the patients and clinicians [7]. This initial version is then revised and validated. During the validation
process, poorly performing questions are identified and removed resulting in a shorter and more valid PROM [8].
PROMs need to be validated to ensure that they actually measure what they are supposed to measure, produce consistent results and capture information that
matter to the target population [9].
PROMs may be collected electronically as ePROMs,
which allow real-time communication of data. The routine collection of ePROMs can assist clinicians with: the
monitoring of patient symptoms; the identification of
unmet needs and concerns; the prioritization and/or the
tailoring of treatment to the needs of individual patients;
and ultimately lead to improvements in the quality of
patient care [6].
The aim of this qualitative study was to explore patient
and clinician views on the potential role for PROMs/
ePROMs in the routine management of rare disease
based on renal transplant recipients transitioning from
paediatric to adult services and patients with primary
sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Summaries of the pathology
and epidemiology of these disease groups are provided
in Tables 1 and 2 respectively.
Methods
This study was reported following the consolidated
criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ)
guideline [23].
Table 1 Renal transplantation
A number of rare conditions such as renal dysplasia, cystinosis, focal
segmental glomerulosclerosis, reflux nephropathy, post urethral valves
and nephronophthisis may lead to babies being born with poorly
developed kidneys or developing significant kidney damage in
childhood [10]. These patients may require a renal transplant at some
point to improve their chances of survival and quality of life [11].
In the UK, the five-year graft survival rates following the first adult deceased and live donor kidney transplant are 86 and 92% respectively
[12].
However, coping with the demands of preserving a renal transplant can
be challenging for adolescents especially during the transition from
paediatric to adult care [13]. There is a high rate of graft failure and
acute or chronic rejection due to poor adherence to prescribed medical
regimen [14]. Studies have found that the transitioning process may
increase the risk of allograft loss [15]. Rejection episodes may be life
threatening to patients and a significant burden to the health system
[16].

Setting
The setting for this study was the Centre for Rare Disease Studies (CRDS), Birmingham [24]. The centre was
set up to: (i) serve as a supra-regional hub bringing together multi-speciality and multi-disciplinary teams to
deliver highly-organised care to patients with rare diseases [24]. (ii) support basic and applied research that
would improve the diagnosis and clinical management
of these disorders [24].
Participants
Renal transplant recipients aged 16–25 years old (the age
range for the transition from paediatric to adult care)
and patients with PSC aged 18–80 years old were recruited using a purposive sampling approach. Eligible
patients from both patient groups were approached in
clinic by medical personnel and provided participant information sheets for the study (see Supplementary material S3). Whilst the CRDS manages a variety of
patients with rare diseases, the decision was made to
focus on these two patient groups as they provided a larger pool of patients to recruit from. All participants were
required to have the capacity to read and write, in order
to be eligible for this study. Doctors and nurses at the
CRDS involved in the care of renal transplant recipients
and or PSC patients were eligible for the study. Written
informed consent was collected from all participants.
Data collection
The only focus group discussion held as part of this
study was conducted with the renal multi-disciplinary
team (MDT). This was moderated by non-clinical research fellows, Drs Fatima Isa (FI) and Tom Keeley
(TK). The aim was to promote group discussion and
allow an assessment of the degree of consensus on the
topics of discussion [25]. FI conducted one-to-one
interviews with PSC clinicians as a mutually convenient
date and time was not found for a focus group discussion for them. FI only conducted one-to-one interviews
with the patients to encourage open discussions of potentially sensitive illness experiences [26].
Participants were asked for their opinions on four validated PROMs commonly used in research involving these
patient groups. The Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire
[27] (CLDQ) and the Short Form 12 [28] (SF12) were given
to patients with PSC and their doctors while the Paediatric
quality of life inventory Transplant Module (PedsQL-TM)
[29] and the EuroQoL-5 dimensions (EQ. 5D) [30] were
evaluated by transplant recipients and their doctors. Table 3
presents a brief description of these PROMs.
Interview guides were used for the focus group and interviews (see Supplementary material S1 and S2). These
were informed by existing literature and discussions with
the research team [36]. The focus group discussion and
interviews were audio recorded and lasted for 30–60
min. The digital files were transcribed verbatim and personal details were anonymised to preserve the identity of
participants.
Data analysis
Inductive thematic analysis was conducted as proposed
by Braun and Clarke [37]. Early transcripts were read repeatedly by FI and OLA to aid familiarisation and assist
with development of codes [38]. The transcripts were
imported to QSR Nvivo 11 for data management and
preliminary codes were developed. These were grouped
into potentially relevant themes based on logic and
reviewed with members of the research team (MC/DK).
Further analysis clarified the specific nature, categorisation and description of each theme. Extracts were selected from the transcripts to illustrate the themes and
sub-themes. Data saturation was not a goal for this
study, as we did not anticipate recruiting sufficient patient participants due to the rare nature of the conditions [39]. Rather, we sought to explore patient and
clinician views on the potential role for PROMs/
ePROMs in the routine management of rare diseases.
Results
A total of 15 one-to-one interviews were conducted.
There were four with patients with PSC; five with renal
transplant recipients; and six with PSC clinicians (three
consultant hepatologists, a registrar, a clinical lecturer
and a specialist nurse). The focus group discussion with
the renal multidisciplinary team (MDT) included 10 participants comprising a: youth worker, renal registrar,
support worker, staff member from Birmingham Children’s Transplant and Transition, renal transplant coordinator, psychologist, renal rare disease specialist
Table 2 Primary sclerosing cholangitis
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a progressive disease of the liver
and gallbladder characterized by inflammation and scarring of the bile
ducts [17]. This may lead to the accumulation of bile which in turn may
lead to liver damage and in the long term, cirrhosis, portal hypertension,
liver tumours and liver failure [17].
While PSC may occur at any age, it is more frequent in adults 30–60
years old. PSC is approximately twice as common in men [18]. It is
estimated that 70–80% of patients with PSC have inflammatory bowel
diseases such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease [19].
PSC is associated with a high level of morbidity which may have a
significant impact on HRQOL [20]. Tiredness or fatigue may be an early
symptom while pruritus, jaundice, abdominal pain, weight loss, fevers,
hyperpigmentation, vitamin deficiencies and metabolic bone disease
may occur as disease progresses [21].
The aim of medical treatment is to control symptoms and manage any
complications. Currently, the only clinically proven treatment for severely
damaged liver is transplantation [17]. However, after transplantation,
there is a likelihood of recurrence and acute rejection [22].

nurse, advanced nurse practitioner in renal transplantation and two kidney specialists.
Four themes were identified, namely: (i) potential benefits of PROMs in the management of rare diseases; (ii)
views on selected questionnaires; (iii) practical considerations for implementation; and (iv) potential facilitators
and barriers of implementation. Fig. 1 illustrates the relationships between the themes and patient and clinician
views. These are discussed in detail below with illustrative participant quotes. Further details are provided in
supplementary Tables S1, S2, S3 and S4.
Potential benefits of PROMs in the management of rare
diseases
Within this theme, participants outlined their views regarding the potential benefits of using PROMs in the
routine clinical management of patients with rare disease. Patients and clinicians first discussed three potential settings in which PROMs may be used, namely: faceto-face clinical consultations, patient reviews between
hospital appointments and virtual clinic consultations.
While all the patients were in favour of using PROMs in
the first two settings, there were mixed views about the
idea of virtual clinics with or without PROMs. These patients strongly preferred face-to-face consultations believing that they promoted a sense of connection with
their doctor.
“Yeah, that’s what I’m kind of suggesting as well so
like I said if you fill it in before then you can do it,
discuss it in the consultation … .” (PSC patient 4)
“….you don’t even have to assess that information in
clinic because that will take some time but between
clinics or post clinic at some point. I am sure clinicians do that.” (PSC patient 1)
“No I feel like that would be stretching it too much, I
feel like the Doctors do need to see you regularly. I
feel like you need to have that connection with your
Consultant because he’s there for you” (Renal transplant patient 1)
Potential benefits of PROMs
One patient suggested that PROMs could provide clinicians an insight into their lived experiences of disease.
“So I feel like it’s really good and like I feel like, if you get
more people to fill it in, you’d know how it is for a renal
patient live their life … ” (Renal transplant patient 1)
Clinicians suggested that PROMs could help improve
patient-clinician relationships by acting as a conversation
starter during clinical consultations, enhancing communication and demonstrating clinician interest and concern to patients.
“ … It’s always about having a conversation … So I
notice here you’ve put ‘I have no problems walking
about’. ‘Can you just tell me a little bit more about
that?’ … .if we don’t start the conversation from it,
we miss the richness that’s going to come from the
patient.” (MDT focus group participant)
Table 3 Description of measures evaluated by study participants
Measure Description
Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 12 (SF-12) A 12-item generic HRQOL measure derived from the SF-36 [31, 32]. There are 8 dimensions
namely: (i) physical functioning (ii) physical role (iii) bodily pain (iv) general health (v) vitality
(vi) social functioning (vii) emotional role (viii) mental health. These can be computed into 2
distinct clusters, PCS-12 and MCS-12 with higher values indicating better HRQOL [31].
EuroQOL 5-dimension (EQ-5D) A utility measure with a self-classifier and a visual analogue scale (VAS) which can be used to
value health states [33]. The self-classifier includes 5 dimensions: (i) mobility (ii) self-care (iii)
usual activities (iv) pain/discomfort (v) anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels of severity (no problems, some problems, and severe problems) and it is possible to describe 243
health states between 0 (dead) and 1 (perfect health) [33].
Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire (CLDQ) A 29-item liver disease–specific HRQOL questionnaire with 6 dimensions [27] namely: (i) abdominal symptoms (ii) activity (iii) emotional function (iv) fatigue (v) systemic symptoms (vi)
worry.
Summary scores for each domain range from 1 (most impairment) to 7 (least impairment).
Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory - Transplant
Module version 3.0 (PedsQL-TM 3.0)
A 46-item transplant specific module of the PedsQL questionnaire [34] with 8 dimensions
namely: 1) about my medicines I (barriers to medical regimen adherence), 2) about my medicines II (medication side effects), 3) my transplant and others (social relationships and transplant), 4) pain and hurt (physical discomfort), 5) worry (worries related to health status), 6)
treatment anxiety (fears regarding medical procedures), 7) how I look (impact of transplant on
appearance), and 8) communication (communication with medical personnel and others regarding transplant issues) [34].
A 5-point response scale is utilized Items are reverse-scored and linearly transformed to a 0 to
100 scale (0 = 100, 1 = 75, 2 = 50, 3 = 25, 4 = 0) with higher scores indicating better HRQOL [35].

“PROMs are important because it impacts the
patient’s journey and a patient should feel that
us as clinicians are listening to them and we
are listening to what concerns them, not just
what we see on a screen and concerns us.” (PSC
doctor 1)
The potential influence of PROMs on patientclinician interaction was particularly important to clinicians who managed patients transitioning from
paediatric to adult care services. Getting this group of
patients engaged in their care was reported as challenging and PROMs was considered a tool that may
assist with engagement.
“ … ..so you get in a habit of always discussing
their care with the parent because they know
exactly how to pinpoint the problem … .where we
have to discuss it with a young person, they will
give you monotone answers, not even care about
discussing their problem … ..” (MDT focus group
participant)
“(referring to patients) … ..they’ll put things down on
a sheet that they won’t actually say to you in person.” (MDT focus group participant)
A clinician believed the use of PROMs could influence
the approach to patient care by enabling clinicians explore other domains of HRQOL such as psychological
wellbeing as well as the physical symptoms.
“Er, it’s asking about mood which I think is something that maybe as clinicians we’re not very good at
asking our patients about directly, er, we generally
tend to say something you know, how are you feeling
and it doesn’t really, we maybe don’t go necessarily
down into mood and anxiety so this is a good way of
picking.” (PSC doctor 6)
Clinicians also suggested that PROMs could facilitate
multidisciplinary care.
“It might be a way of getting other allied health professionals on board” (PSC doctor 4)
Fig. 1 Thematic schema
Aiyegbusi et al. Health and Quality of Life Outcomes (2020) 18:177 Page 5 of 12

A patient suggested that completing a PROM could
help patients recall issues they might want to discuss
during their clinical consultation.
“This questionnaire is good. It kind of jogs your
memory.” (PSC patient 1)
Patients and clinicians believed that PROMs could improve symptom reporting and assist with monitoring the
evolution of symptoms over time. They also felt PROMs
could be used to assess patient response to treatment
and the side effects of medication.
“I think also it would be useful as a tool sort of over
time to see how things change for individual patients
and to get a better idea of how symptoms progress
with time” (PSC doctor 2)
“ … ..a lot of the young adults and older adults do
have significant side effects from the drugs, even
though our objective markers are good. So I think exploring that further, you know could be really very
helpful.” (MDT focus group participant)
A clinician suggested that PROMs may facilitate the
stratification of patients so that the most symptomatic
patients are seen by consultants while more stable patients are either seen at nurse-led clinics and/or seen less
frequently in clinic.
“You can use it to improve the care of the patients in
clinic … you can stratify if patients have a lot of
symptom burden or anxiety or something, you can
make sure that they’re seen by the consultant. If
someone’s very minimally symptomatic and is actually very well, maybe they could have nurse-led care
or you know come less frequently” (PSC doctor 3)
Views on selected PROMs
Views on CLDQ and SF12 (patients with PSC and their
clinicians)
Patients and clinicians compared the CLDQ and the
SF12. Both were of the opinion that the CLDQ was acceptable and relevant, covering most PSC symptoms.
However some patients pointed out that a patient may
experience symptoms included in the questionnaire due
to other illnesses and not necessarily PSC. Patients and
clinicians considered the SF12 too generic and of limited
relevance for PSC patients. A doctor suggested that it
could be useful for comparing patients with different
medical conditions.
“(referring to CLDQ) Yeah, I think that one’s quite
good because all those questions are quite relevant
to the stuff that I kind of sometimes feel.” (PSC patient 4)
“…the questionnaire (CLDQ) is fine; it’s just, er,
whether, there’s no way that says that we know that
it relates to PSC.” (PSC patient 2)
“I mean a lot of these things in SF12, apart from
question 2 and perhaps 1, a lot of them are related
to patient ……..motivation. They don’t really talk
about things like cholangitis flares, itching.” (PSC
doctor 1)
“But it’s very generic (referring to SF12), but it’s then,
so it’s very easy for someone to fill this in and for
you to then compare this with diabetes, obesity,
whatever or healthy people, but it’s not liver and it’s
not PSC IBD” (PSC doctor 3)
Patients and clinicians suggested including a free text
box where patients can mention other issues not covered
in the questionnaire. PSC doctors suggested that patients
would prefer questionnaires tailored to their needs and
commented on the absence of direct questions about patient fears.
“….it is a good start because it gives you a baseline,
but if you really wanted to go the whole way, I think
patients would like to have something that is specific
to them.” (PSC doctor 3)
“I think what’s missing is the direct, what is the fear
that you have of dying, what’s the fear of you of getting colon cancer, what’s the fear of you getting bile
duct cancer, and how does that fear manifest itself?”
(PSC doctor 3)
Views on PedsQL and EQ-5D (renal transplant recipients
and MDT participants)
Patients and MDT participants thought that the PedsQL
would be helpful and relevant as it covered issues frequently discussed in clinic. However, some patients felt
the PedsQL was more relevant to recent renal transplant
recipients.
“I feel like this one’s really good because I can relate
to so many things in here…” (Renal transplant patient 1)
“I think it would be more relevant people who
have just recently had their transplants so people
who are being discharged from hospital should
be given these questionnaires.” (Renal transplant
patient 3)
Aiyegbusi et al. Health and Quality of Life Outcomes (2020) 18:177 Page 6 of 12

Patients suggested adding questions that inquire about
patient experience of the receiving a transplant. They
also suggested including questions that explore family
views or a separate questionnaire for family members.
“See there could be another survey for parents
….basic questions to see how parents feel as well as
the patient, I know you’re trying to see how the patient feels but then again the services could also be
developed for parents.” (Renal transplant patient 3)
An MDT participant suggested adding questions that
went beyond physical concerns and delved into patient
fears about their future. This suggestion echoed the
point made by a PSC doctor about the need for questions addressing patient fears of developing other conditions in future.
“I suppose sort of identity, which is difficult to grasp,
and also fears for the future, Will I need a transplant in the future? Will my children get this in the
future? Will anybody find me attractive in the future? I know you’ve got visible difference here…I suppose are we meeting their unmet needs?” (MDT
focus group participant)
Concerning the EQ-5D, an MDT participant felt anxiety
and depression, which were combined in question number five, were very different concepts. Therefore,
responding to the question would be challenging.
“Certainly with the anxiety and the depression one
on the EQ5D, anxiety and depression are two really
different things, so if you’re ticking one, is it because
you’re anxious, because you’re depressed or actually
you don’t really know what you’re feeling?” (MDT
focus group participant)
Practical considerations for implementation
Patients and clinicians discussed numerous practical issues they believed required consideration/addressing for
PROMs to be implemented successfully in clinical
practice.
(i) Administrative issues
One of the issues considered was the mode of administration. Patients and clinicians compared electronic
and paper formats of PROMs, weighed the pros and
cons of each and then expressed their preferences. Some
participants believed completing electronic questionnaires using mobile devices and tablets was quick, easier
to manage and environmentally friendly while others felt
that paper questionnaires would give them the chance to
provide more information. All the clinicians preferred an
electronic format while three out of eight patients preferred paper questionnaires. One patient was indifferent
while another expressed a preference for face-to-face
conversation despite choosing electronic questionnaires.
“I don’t mind paper, but I would prefer electronically. First of all, it’s environmentally-friendly and –
it’s also much better to keep the record electronically,
isn’t it? less hassle, it’s much quicker, it’s more efficient, more accurate…” (PSC patient 3)
“I think paper based, yeah…” (Transplant patient 1)
“I think they’re a lot more engaging on an iPad,
yeah. I just think they’re a bit more … I honestly
think they hate pen and paper” (MDT focus group
participant)
A majority of the study participants felt that the local
myHealth@QEHB patient portal was suitable and acceptable platform for delivery of ePROMs. myHealth@-
QEHB is a secure electronic patient records portal
developed by the in-house Technical Development and
Informatics team at University Hospitals Birmingham
NHS Foundation Trust (UHB) [40]. It allows patients in
long-term care to remotely access much of their clinical
information held at the hospital, including their letters
and laboratory results [40].
However one clinician complained that the 2-part patient registration process was cumbersome.
“So we could do it through MyHealth [patient portal], it’s just a bit of a faff for us to do this in the
clinic because the patient has to have set up their
MyHealth account and then remember their log-in.”
(MDT focus group participant)
Concerning the frequency of administration, participants
suggested time intervals ranging from every three
months to yearly. The general opinion was that the timing should coincide with the existing frequency of
follow-ups appointments.
“… Yeah, I come in every year anyway so I’d be good
to do it every year and then you can see what happened last year to the next year can’t you? If it’s getting worse or better…” (PSC patient 4)
Participants compared the option of patients completing their PROMs in the waiting room just before their
clinic appointments to completion at home prior to their
Aiyegbusi et al. Health and Quality of Life Outcomes (2020) 18:177 Page 7 of 12

appointment dates. Participants acknowledged that completion in the waiting room had the benefit of providing
patients with something to do whilst waiting to be seen.
Participants thought that completion of questionnaires
at home, well ahead of clinic appointments, meant that
patients could do so in the comfort of their own homes,
without the stress associated with being in clinic. It also
had the advantage of allowing patients more time to
think about their health and responses.
“Normally I’d just do it beforehand or like, do you
know, while I’m waiting for the Doctor to call me in
after my bloods, I’d just complete it then. (Transplant patient 1)
“I think like I said maybe if you do it a couple of
weeks before or something and then go through it
when we’re there at the consultation and that’d
probably be quite good…” (PSC patient 4)
“To get the most honesty out of people, do the questionnaires at the patients’ own comfort and their
own space.” (Transplant patient 3)
(ii) Access to patient data
All the patients wanted their consultant to have access
to their PROM data and three patients went further to
say they had no reservations about who had access to
their ePROM data as long as it was for patient care, clinician training or research purposes.
“….any problems I’d like the consultant at Queen
Elizabeth Hospital [to know] they’re marvellous and
they sound as though they care.” (PSC patient 2)
“I don’t really mind. I mean, if it helps in research or
anything, then, you know, I’m all for it.” (PSC patient 3)
(iii)Responding to ePROM data
Clinicians suggested that the severity of issues
highlighted by ePROM data would determine the scale
and speed of clinical response. Matters judged life threatening would be given priority and dealt with swiftly by the
consultant while other issues might require nurses telephoning to patients to obtain more information and/or rescheduling clinic appointments to an earlier date.
“But it depends what we’re identifying doesn’t it? If
it’s, you know my tummy aches when I stand, that’s
something that we can say we’ll look into it. If somebody declares they’re literally suicidal, I … we have
no … realistic option but to deal with that there and
then.” (MDT focus group participant)
(iv) Patient-related issues
Participants mentioned the issue of patients with special needs or learning disabilities suggesting that a decision needs to be made about who provides proxy data
for this groups of patients. It was recommended that
questionnaires should be provided in other languages for
patients who cannot read and write in English.
“And then with someone with special needs, again
you have to decide who is going to advocate for them
because, I mean you want to get a true … opinion”
(MDT focus group participant)
“And I guess it may be useful for those patients, for
whom English is not their first language, to have
some of these questions and there, available in their
own language.” (PSC doctor 2)
Patients becoming bored completing the same questionnaires over time and privacy issues were mentioned as
issues that warranted careful consideration. A transplant
patient, who is on immunosuppression therapy, raised
the issue of hygiene if ipads were provided for use in
clinic.
“I wouldn’t mind but I don’t know, it might get a bit
boring [laughs], you know what I mean?” (Transplant patient 5)
“I suppose, and obviously…..if … there’d be certain
questions that I wouldn’t want somebody to fill in if
they felt there was an observer.” (MDT focus
participant)
“I have to be very aware of hygiene and stuff so if
someone has just used that iPad with a cough or
cold I would be very reluctant to use that one.”
(Transplant patient 3)
Facilitators and barriers of implementation
Clinician enthusiasm was considered a facilitator for the
implementation and use of ePROMs. The use of computer adaptive testing was suggested as a way to reduce
patient burden and facilitate the use of ePROMs. It was
also suggested that sending patients reminders would
improve completion rates.
Aiyegbusi et al. Health and Quality of Life Outcomes (2020) 18:177 Page 8 of 12

“So I guess us being enthusiastic about it [laughs].”
(PSC doctor 2)
“If you could reduce the size of the questionnaire, depending on their answers, so you know computer adaptive testing, that would be helpful.” (PSC doctor 5)
“I suppose the main barrier is that people have very
good intentions to fill them out and then just forget…” (PSC doctor 6)
A lack of awareness among patients and clinicians of the
importance and potential benefits of collecting ePROMs
was cited as a potential barrier. The time constraints
during clinics could prevent clinicians from acting on
ePROM results and this could become a barrier to the
use of ePROMs. Patients’ computer literacy levels, language and access to internet or computer or phones
were other potential barriers identified.
“They won’t understand how it helps them. You
might discover that clinicians don’t think it’s important, because they’ll say, well this is just academic,
it’s just a way of measuring something that I know,
it’s designed to find out more symptoms than are
relevant, so they’ll just say, well I don’t think it’s important.” (PSC doctor 3)
“And when you need to stop the consultation for…
you need half an hour consultation if somebody reveals that they’re feeling suicidal and you know in
the middle of a big transplant clinic … I just think it
needs to be thought out, you can’t just introduce it
and then just sort of, it’s like an unexploded bomb
then.” (MDT focus group participant)
“There will be a group who is not, who aren’t as
comfortable, so it’s important to have the other option, as well as the electronic option.” (PSC doctor 5)
Discussion
Our study found that patients and clinicians supported the
use of PROMs as part of patient management and identified a number of potential benefits. They evaluated selected
questionnaires, identified various practical issues that need
to be considered and outlined facilitators and barriers to
the use of PROMs/ePROMs in routine practice.
Participants generally believed that the use of PROMs
in routine clinical practice could be of significant benefit
to patients and clinicians and may facilitate a more holistic, patient-centred, approach to care. Participants specifically proposed that the use of PROMs could improve
patient-clinician communication as suggested by numerous studies [41, 42]. It is possible that by facilitating
better communication between patients and clinicians,
and improving patient engagement with their care, the
use of PROMs may have a positive impact on treatment
adherence [43, 44]. The use of PROMs could potentially
assist with the management of patients transitioning
from paediatric to adult care services by promoting their
engagement with services and providing healthcare providers an avenue to assess and monitor patients’ adjustment to the changes occurring during this process.
Other potential benefits identified by the participants
and supported by literature were: improving the monitoring and reporting of symptoms; highlighting issues to
address during clinical consultations; aid patient recall of
issues to discuss in clinic and management of appointments [45, 46]. It should be noted that although patients
in our study supported the use of PROMs in their future
management, a number of them felt that PROMs and/or
virtual clinics should not replace regular face-to-face
clinical consultations. At the moment, high quality evidence to support the use of virtual clinics is limited and
equivocal [47–49].
Participants felt the disease-specific questionnaires
(CLDQ and PedsQL-TM) were more relevant and more
useful than the generic SF-12 and EQ5D. Studies have
suggested that generic measures like the SF-12 and the
EQ5D may be inadequate for assessing the impact of rare
diseases on patients and recommend using diseasespecific measures when available [50, 51]. Although the
CLDQ has been reported to have good test-retest reliability and cross-sectional validity, [52] this should be interpreted with caution as the evidence was obtained from
studies that combined the results of patients with PSC
with that of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC)
and hepatitis B & C [53, 54]. Preliminary validation of the
PSC PRO, a new measure developed in accordance with
FDA guidelines suggests good psychometric properties
[55, 56]. The PedsQL-TM has been reported to have good
reliability and validity in young patients with transplant
[34, 35].
While patients and clinicians in our study expressed the
desire for questionnaires with greater disease specificity,
the excessive variations that exist within many rare conditions make the development of such measures impractical.
Rüther et al. reported a similar situation in their study of
patients with lysosomal storage diseases [50]. The comments from the patients and clinicians have also
highlighted the important aspects of PRO development
and administration that may require clarification during
the design and implementation of an ePROM system.
Clinicians raised the issue of delegating the completion
of PROMs to carers of patients with learning disabilities.
Whilst this might seem a logical solution in this group of
patients, research has shown that the use of proxy respondents may lead to response bias with proxies reporting
Aiyegbusi et al. Health and Quality of Life Outcomes (2020) 18:177 Page 9 of 12

more impairment in affect, physical and cognitive function
[57]. Furthermore, the European Medicines Agency
(EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
discourage the use of proxy data [5, 58].
Our study participants suggested adding comment
boxes to the questionnaires. While comment boxes
might help individualise questionnaires and allow patients the opportunity to provide additional information,
they may be difficult to process into usable information
in routine clinical practice as manual mapping may be
time consuming [59]. Chung et al. found that 62% of patients’ free text electronic entries could be structured
into drop down menus options using computer programming [59]. The use of Computer Adaptive Testing
(CAT), although in its infancy, may simultaneously reduce questionnaire burden and tailor questionnaires to
the specific needs of the individual [4].
Participants believed clinician interest would be a key
factor for successful implementation of ePROMs while a
lack of awareness among patients and clinicians, time
constraints, patients’ literacy levels and access to internet/electronic devices were identified as potential barriers to the use of PROMs. These findings are in keeping
with the findings presented in a number of previous
studies [46, 60].
One of limitations of this study was the difficulty of
recruiting a sufficient number of participants to ensure
that data saturation was achieved. However, this is not
unique to our study as other studies involving patients
with rare diseases have encountered similar difficulties
[39, 61, 62]. The small sample sizes makes it difficult to
preserve the anonymity of participants hence the decision not to provide a detailed socio-demographic description of the participants [63]. In addition, the
transferability of some of our findings may be limited to
settings that manage patients that closely match our
study participants in terms of disease and age.
Conclusion
The use of PROMs/ePROMs in the management of patients with rare diseases may facilitate patient-centred
care by promoting patient-clinician communication,
highlighting aspects of HRQOL that are important to
patients and encouraging patient involvement in their
care. The insights from this study could inform the design, development and implementation of an ePROM
system for patients with rare diseases.
