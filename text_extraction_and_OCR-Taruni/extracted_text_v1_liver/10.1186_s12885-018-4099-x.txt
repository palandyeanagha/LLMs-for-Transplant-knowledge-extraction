Abstract
Background: To evaluate survival data and local tumor control after transarterial chemoembolization in two groups
with different embolization protocols for the treatment of HCC patients.
Methods: Ninty-nine patients (mean age: 63.6 years), 78 male (78.8%) with HCC were repeatedly treated with
chemoembolization in 4-week-intervals. Eighty-eight patients had BCLC-Stage-B and in 11 patients,
chemoembolization was performed for bridging (BCLC-Stage-A). In total, 667 chemoembolization treatments were
performed (mean 6.7 treatments/patient). The administered chemotherapeutic agent included mitomycin. For
embolization, lipiodol only (n = 51;51.5%; mean age 63.8 years; 38 male), or lipiodol plus degradable starch
microspheres (DSM) (n = 48; 48.5%; mean age 63.4 years; 40 male) were used. The local tumor response was
assessed by MRI using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1). Patient survival times were
evaluated using Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests.
Results: The local tumor control in the lipiodol-group was: PR (partial response) in 11 (21.6%), SD (stable disease) in
32 (62.7%) and PD (progressive disease) in 8 cases (15.7%). In the lipiodol-DSM-group, PR was seen in 14 (29.2%), SD
in 22 (45.8%), and PD in 12 (25.0%) individuals (p = 0.211). The median survival of patients after chemoembolization
with lipiodol was 25 months and in the lipiodol-DSM-group 28 months (p = 0.845).
Conclusion: Our data suggest a slight benefit of the use of lipiodol and DSM in comparison of using lipiodol only
for chemoembolization of HCC in terms of local tumor control and survival data, this trend did not reach the level
of significance.

Background
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common
primary malignancy of the liver [1]. Surgical resection,
liver transplantation, and tumor ablation, e.g. using radio
frequency or thermic techniques, are the only curative
options for patients with HCC [2]. However, all options
have limited applicability: only few patients (25%) are appropriate candidates for transplantation and there is a
lack of liver donors. While surgical resection is the first
line therapy for primary liver cancer, only 10-30% of the
patients are eligible for surgery with curative intent. This
can be explained by frequent presence of extensive disease and poor liver function due to cirrhosis [2–4]. Furthermore, local tumor ablation using microwave or
thermal treatment with radio frequency and kryotherapy
respectively, is predominantly effective for tumors with a
diameter less than 5 cm [5].
Patients suffering from HCC greater 5 cm diameter,
embolization and chemotherapy are established treatment
options [6, 7]. Treatment with embolization and

chemotherapy can be conducted individually by using
transarterial embolization (TAE), transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), or TACE in combination with drugeluting-beats (DEB-TACE). TACE is a treatment option
for non-resectable HCC [6, 7], resulting in a high cytotoxic effect after usage of chemotherapeutic drugs and
causing ischaemia due to the use of embolization particles
[2, 4, 8]. Consequently, TACE might be a useful treatment
option to improve outcomes of potentially curative therapies or as a bridging therapy to liver transplantation [8].
Although TACE in HCC patients has already been intensively investigated, literature is still inconclusive about the
relative effectiveness of different embolization agents [9].
The aim of this retrospective study was to compare
tumor response and survival time after transarterial
chemoembolization in HCC patients by using two
different chemoembolization agent protocols (lipiodolonly versus lipiodol plus degradable starch microspheres (DSM)).
Methods
Patient population
The local ethics committee approved this retrospective
study. All patients signed consent prior to the clinical
treatment. From January 2007 to April 2015, 99 patients
(21 women and 78 men) with HCC underwent repetitive
TACE, as predefined by the hospital’s multidisciplinary
tumor board. Survival rates were evaluated by reviewing
clinical reports until December 2015. By the time of the
first chemoembolization session, the mean age was
63.6 years (age range, 34-83 years). Eighty-eight patients
had BCLC-Stage-B and in 11 patients, chemoembolization was performed as bridging prior to liver transplantation (BCLC-Stage-A). Hepatitis B was found in 29
(29.3%), hepatitis C in 36 (36.4%), and both in 9 (9.1%)
patients. Twenty-six patients had a history of alcohol
abuse (26.3%). Three patients (3.0%) had
hemochromatosis. 91 patients had liver cirrhosis
(Table 1).
Fourteen patients (14.1%) were treated because of a
recurrence or as advanced therapy of HCC after liver
resection, and 4 patients (4.0%) after prior radiofrequency ablation. This population was taken out as a subgroup for analyzing survival time and radiologic
response in comparison to the population which
received TACE as a first line treatment.
In total, 667 chemoembolization treatments were performed in 4-week intervals with a mean of 6.7 treatments per patient (range: 2-19 treatments per patient).
Patients with less than two treatments were not included
for evaluation. All patients received 10 mL of the chemotherapeutic agent mitomycin per treatment with
slight varieties depending on laboratory techniques. Subjects included between 2007 and 2011 were treated with
TACE and lipiodol-only, while patients included
between 2012 and 2015 had a combination of lipiodol
and DSM. This is caused in a strategy-change in our
hospital, regarding a better experience and outcome for
the patients.
Patients who met the exclusion criteria prior to the
treatment were not included for evaluation. During this
retrospective study, no patient was excluded.
Inclusion criteria
The treatment decision was made by our multidisciplinary
tumor board, involving abdominal surgeons, interventional

radiologists, and oncologists. In all patients, the presence of
HCC was histologically proven by liver biopsy.
In cases that were eligible for liver transplantation (BCLC
Stage A), TACE was performed as bridging treatment.
In all patients, we calculated the total volume of all
hepatic lesions per patient in addition to the depending
liver volume in order to estimate the hepatic tumor load.
Only those patients with < 70% hepatic tumorinvolvement were treated. To be eligible for TACE, patients had to fulfil certain laboratory and clinical criteria
including adequate hematic, hepatic and renal functions
in addition to an ECOG performance score of 0 or 1.
Study patients should have had at least 2 treatments of
chemoembolization, performed with a 4-week-interval
in-between.
Exclusion criteria
We excluded patients with a hepatic tumor load greater
than 70% in order to avoid impairment of the remaining
liver function and liver failure. Further, we excluded
patients with total thrombosis of the portal vein, patients
with extrahepatic metastases and those with renal (creatinine level > 2 mg/dl in serum), hepatic, respiratory, or
cardiovascular impairment.
Inadequate performance status as indicated by an
ECOG > 1, nutritional impairment, high serum total bilirubin level (> 3 mg/dL), and poor hepatic synthesis
(albumin level < 2.0 mg/dL in serum) were further exclusion criteria.
TACE- therapy
After introduction of a catheter using the Seldinger technique through the femoral artery, an angiography of the
abdominal vessels was performed. For angiography a 5F
Pig-Tail catheter (Boston Scientific) was used, affiliated
by an exchanged over the guide wire with a 5F SideWinder catheter (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan), used for
selective catheterization and angiographic visualization
of the superior mesenteric artery and the celiac trunk.
After selective catheterization an exploratory overview
of the aorta and angiography of the celiac trunk as well
as indirect portography were performed. Therefore, contrast media was injected after catheterization to simulate
the physiological blood flow. Depending on the size, location, and arterial supply of the tumor, the tip of the
catheter was advanced further into tumor-supplying
arteries. After positioning the catheter chemotherapeutic
agent was administered intra-arterially. The tumor
vessels were occluded with embolization agents. After
embolization, devascularization was confirmed with
additional angiography of the hepatic artery.
In case of involvement of both hepatic lobes, the lobe
with the higher tumor burden was treated first. The
other lobe was treated in another session of
chemoembolization, to keep the risk of liver failure as
low as possible.
The chemotherapeutic agent used was mitomycin
(Medac®, Hamburg, Germany) alone [10] with a
maximum of 8 mg/m2 body surface. Mitomycin was
applicated with either lipiodol (Guerbet®, Sulzbach,
Germany) only, or lipiodol in combination with DSM
(EmboCept®S, PharmaCept GmbH, Berlin, Germany)
(200-450 mg pro session) in sandwich technique. After
finalizing the treatment, a compression bandage or a
percutaneous closure device (Angio-Seal™, St. Jude
Medical, Saint Paul, USA) was attached on the side of
puncture.
For embolization, agents were injected under fluoroscopic guidance until a stasis of bloodflow was achieved.
Patients were transferred to an internal medicine ward
for clinical observation subsequent to the treatment and
were discharged on the procedure day when no complications were encountered.
Treatment sessions were repeated until the end point
of treatment was reached, defined as a state of stable
disease situation in two successive sessions. A session
covers 3 consecutive TACE treatments, performed with
4 week intervals in-between the treatments. The other
endpoint was the case of progressive disease.
In case of PD, patients were reevaluated by our multidisciplinary tumor board for alternative treatment options.
In case of de novo lesions or disease progression
during follow-up despite initial tumor stabilization,
patients were retreated by using the treatment plan.
MRI follow-up
MRI follow-up was performed to evaluate the tumor
response. For the purpose of planning the intervention,
unenhanced and contrast-enhanced MR imaging with
the administration of 0.1 mmol/kg body weight of gadoter acid (Dotarem®, Guerbet GmbH, Sulzbach, Germany)
or gadobutrol (Gadovist®, Bayer Vital GmbH, leverkusen,
Germany) was performed in all patients.
A 1.5-T MRI-system (Magnetom Espree; Magnetom
Avanto-fit; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) was used.
Enhanced MR imaging was performed before and
4 weeks after each session. Unenhanced MR imaging
was performed prior to each TACE treatment. A
monthly follow-up after the endpoint of angiographic
treatment was done for a period of 3 months by MRI.
After that, this regimen was changed to an interval of
3 months for the entire life of the patients. None of the
included patients was lost to follow-up.
Four to six hours after embolization, retention of
iodized oil in the HCC lesions was confirmed by
unenhanced computed tomography (CT). All CT scans
were performed using spiral technique (Somatom
Definition AS 128, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany).

Quantitative and statistical evaluation
Datasets of all patients were evaluated retrospectively.
Each clinical data was obtained either by contacting the
patients themselves or by contacting their treating physicians. In addition, we reviewed patients’ medical records.
Event occurrences were reported.
All MRI and CT readings were performed in consensus by two radiologists, each with more than 5 and
12 years of experience in abdominal imaging. The local
tumor response was assessed by MRI, using Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1.).
Statistical analysis was performed using BiAs 10.12
software.
Survival times, starting at point of first chemoembolization, were calculated to obtain median and mean
survival times by using the Kaplan-Meier method and
compared with the log-rank test. Survival rates were
calculated in terms of 1-, 2- and 3-year survival. Subgroup analysis and differences in survival between
groups were assessed by log-rank test. P ≤ 0.05 was considered significant.
Results
Local results
Location of the tumor was in 45.45% (45/99) in the right
liver lobe, and in 5.1% (5/99) in the left lobe. In 49.45%
(49/99), both liver lobes were affected. The number of
liver lesions were as follows: 48.5% of patients (48/99)
had multiple lesions (≥ 5), 4.0% (4/99) had four lesions,
and 8.1% (8/99) had three lesions. In 28.3% of patients
(28/99), two lesions were detected and 11.1%11 (11/99)
of patients had a singular lesion.
The post-interventional evaluation was based on the
RECIST 1.1 und all patients were revealed using this criteria: partial response (PR) (Fig. 1) in 25.3% (25/99),
stable disease (SD) in 54.5% (54/99), and progressive disease (PD) in 20.2% (20/99) of all patients.
In the lipiodol only group (51.5%; 51/99), we observed
partial response in 21.6% (11/51), stable disease in 62.7%
(32/51), and progressive disease in 15.7% (8/51). In the
lipiodol-DSM group (48.5%; 48/99), partial response was
encountered in 29.2% (14/48), 45.8% (22/48) had stable
disease, and progressive disease was observed in 25.0%
(12/48) of patients. There was no statistically significant
difference between the two treatment protocols (p =
0.211) (Table 2).
Survival analysis
Median and mean survival times were 28 and
36.4 months, respectively. Survival rate after the endpoint of TACE was 85% at 1 year, 60% at 2 years, and
40% at 3 years per Kaplan Meier evaluation (Fig. 2).

For patients with chemoembolization with lipiodol
only, the median and mean survival times were 25 and
28.4 months, respectively (Fig. 3a). Using the combination of lipiodol and DSM for chemoembolization, the
median and mean survival times were 28 and
35.7 months (Fig. 3b), respectively. Statistical analysis
showed no differences among the groups using the logrank test (p = 0.845).
Median and mean survival for patients with stable disease (SD) were 28 months vs. 27.6 months (lipiodol only
vs. lipiodol and DSM), for patients with progressive disease (PD) were 25 months vs. 34.4 months. In case of
partial response (PR), 43 months vs. 46.4 months were
reported. Analysis showed no statistical differences
between the three RECIST-groups using the log-rank
test (p = 0.146).
Eightteen (18.1%) patients had a recurrence or
intensified further therapy of HCC after liver resection
or radiofrequency ablation. Analysis of the results from
this pretreated subgroup compared with the results of
the non-pretreated group showed no statistical
significance regarding survival time (p = 0.67) and radiological response (p = 0.59) and furthermore, no impact
on the results.
After the endpoint of TACE, 8.1% of patients (8/99)
underwent a liver transplantation, 3.0% (3/99) received
liver resection, and 21.2% (21/99) were further treated
with ablation (RF or MWA).
Overall, the majority of patients tolerated chemoembolization well and all patients were discharged from
the hospital on the day of treatment. However, a
small group of patients (n = 15) had symptoms of
abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting for 2 to 7 days
(“postembolization syndrome”). No major complications or allergic reactions were reported in our
patient group.
Discussion
TACE is one of the most common angiographic option
for the treatment of HCC. The applied drugs and
embolization agents differ among sites and physicians
due to lack of knowledge. A commonly used
embolization agent in TACE for the treatment of HCC
is lipiodol. Lipiodol is a poppy-seed oil, which is used in
interventional radiology as a radio-opacifying contrast
agent [10–12]. Due to its chemical characteristics, lipiodol is used in lymphangiography, transarterial
embolization (TAE), and chemoembolization (TACE).
Furthermore, it is useful in monitoring tumor changes
after treatment with TAE or TACE, based on its iodine
component allowing the visualization of the tumor and

the treated area by CT [12–16]. When injected in the
hepatic artery after selective or superselective
catheterization, lipiodol remains in tumor nodules for
several weeks to over a year, due to a siphoning effect
from hypervascularization and neovascularization of
tumor vessels and the absence of Kupfer-cells inside the
tumor. Lipiodol distributes in the tumor artery branches
and the peritumor portal venules, thus allowing transient
dual embolization [16, 17].
Degradable starch microspheres (DSM) can also be
used as a chemoembolization agent. After injection, in a
similar technique as lipiodol, DSM provide transient
occlusion of small arteries. Further, DSM may improve
therapeutic effect of applied anticancer drugs [18]. The
duration of DSM in the tumor vessels is limited to
80 min [19]. DSM is administered until stasis of arterial
flow or reflux [20].
Several treatment studies of liver tumors indicated that
TACE with a combination of lipiodol and DSM as occlusion agents improve the therapeutic effect of chemotherapeutic agents compared to lipiodol only or treatment
using chemotherapeutic agents alone without
embolization agents [21]. However, a few studies have
evaluated TACE using DSM as a mono-agent in HCC
patients [22, 23].
This current single-center study was performed to determine the response and survival rates for patients who
underwent TACE of HCC and to compare the effect of two
regimens of embolization, namely lipiodol only or in combination with degradable starch microspheres.
Our study shows that TACE with lipiodol and degradable starch microspheres does not result in a significant
better local tumor control. However, in patients with
multiple liver lesions, a trend towards using the combination for TACE instead of using lipiodol only could be
demonstrated.
Considering survival rates, a positive trend, but not a
significant better outcome could be shown for using
lipiodol and degradable starch microspheres compared
to lipiodol-only.
Yamasaki et al. [19] treated 45 patients with HCC
using transarterial infusion therapy (TAI) either with
lipiodol (n = 15), DSM (n = 15), or the combination of
lipiodol and DSM (n = 15). The TAI utilized the combination of lipiodol and DSM was superior to TAI using
lipiodol or DSM only because of demonstrating
improvements in therapeutic effects and progressionfree survival. In our study, the documented response
rates were 40% in the lipiodol group, 53.4% in the DSM
group, and 80% in the lipiodol and DSM group. No significant differences between the three groups were seen
regarding the survival rates.
We found a response rate of 21.6% in the lipiodol only
group, and 29.2% in the lipiodol plus DSM group. Treatment response in the lipiodol plus DSM group was
superior compared to the lipiodol only group, but this
result showed no statistical significance, as it was shown
in the study of Yamasaki et al..
Some of the discrepancy may be attributed to the
performed technique of TACE, such as treatment
with cisplatin in the study of Yamasaki et al.
compared to the use of mitomycin in our study.
Furthermore, all patients of Yamasaki et al. had up to
6 treatment sessions. In our study, 667 chemoembolization procedures were performed (mean, 6.7 treatments per patient; range, 2-19 sessions).

Gruber-Rouh et al. BMC Cancer (2018) 18:188 Page 6 of 8

It has been stated that the assessment of tumor
response after one TACE session is very critical and
questionable, and that at least two TACE sessions should
be performed in the same targeted lesions before further
treatment is abandoned [24, 25].
In the study of Kirchhoff et al. [24], 47 patients
received TACE with DSM and lipiodol. Doxorubicin
and cisplatin were used as chemotherapeutic agents.
Median survival rate was 26 months and 1-year survival
rate was 75%, which is comparable to our results.
Achenbach et al. [25] performed TACE in 22 patients
using mitomycin and lipiodol. Median survival of
patients in this study was 14 months with 1- and 2- year
survival rates of 69% and 29%, respectively. The investigators reported shorter survival times and lower survival
rates compared to our study, when using mitomycin as
chemotherapeutic agent, similar to our study, but
lipiodol only for embolization.
Dumortier et al. [26] evaluated 89 patients with
unresectable HCC, treated with chemoembolization.
Treatment included up to six cycles of hepatic intraarterial application of lipiodol with doxorubicine and
gelatine sponge. The median survival was 13 months
with a 4-year survival rate of 13.6%. The discrepancies may be attributed to the used chemotherapeutic
agent (doxorubicin versus mitomycin), different
occlusion agents (lipiodol plus gelatin sponge versus
lipiodol or lipiodol plus DSM), or the amount of
TACE sessions.
Notably in our and priorly published studies, radiological response to the therapy was not associated with
improved survival. Superior response suggests, that
TACE using DSM and lipiodol could be a suitable palliative treatment in patients with HCC [18, 24, 27].
The current study has several limitations. First, the
study design was retrospective. Second, there was an
overlap between the palliative indication and the neoadjuvant indication of chemoembolization. Last, more
patients should have been recruited and a prospective
randomized study would be more accurate to assess
treatment safety and efficacy of TACE with lipiodol
versus DSM.
Conclusion
Our data suggest a slight benefit of the use of lipiodol
and DSM in comparison of using lipiodol only for
chemoembolization of HCC in terms of local tumor
control and survival data, this trend did not reach the
level of significance.
