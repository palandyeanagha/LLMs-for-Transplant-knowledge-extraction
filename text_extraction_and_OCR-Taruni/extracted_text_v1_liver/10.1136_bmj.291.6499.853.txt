Large hepatocellular cancers: hepatic resection or
liver transplantation?
0 S0REIDE, A CZERNIAK, L H BLUMGART
Abstract
Thirteen patients with primary hepatocellular cancer
were studied to outline criteria for resectability in
patients with large liver tumours. The mean age was 34
and the mean tumour diameter 13 cm (range 7-18 cm).
Five of the tumours had a diameter of 15 cm or more.
Extensive radiological investigations showed that seven
of the patients had tumours of both right and left lobes
of the liver, 10 had evidence of vascular invasion, and
three had evidence of extrahepatic spread. Only two of the
patients underwent a classically described formal
hepatic resection, the rest having extensive resections
crossing major anatomical planes. In no instance did the
vascular invasion preclude resection, and extrahepatic
spread could be verified in only one patient.
The traditional criteria of resectability-that is,
tumours located to one main lobe of the liver without
vascular invasion and extrahepatic spread-can and
should be extended. Resection may be preferable to
transplantation even in patients with large primary
liver tumours.
Introduction
Primary hepatocellular carcinoma is generally considered to be
a highly malignant tumour with an extremely poor prognosis.
Mean survival time for untreated patients rarely exceeds three
or four months,'-4 although survival times of up to two years
have been reported.5 On the other hand, survival after hepatic

resection for primary liver cell cancer varies considerably.
Critical analyses indicate that the main reason for the variation
in results is probably variation in the characteristics of the patient
populations-that is, differences between Asian and African
patients on the one hand and, on the other, Western populations,
in whom underlying liver cirrhosis is less common.6 Whereas
survival after resection is low in most Asian reports' 7 ' it is
improving in Western studies.9 -12
The identification of the fibrolamellar variant of hepatocellular carcinoma in recent years is also important. This type of
tumour usually occurs in young patients and in non-cirrhotic
livers, and the tumour is often large. This carcinoma has several
unusual characteristics, the most important of which is that the
prognosis is probably better than that for other variants of primary hepatocellular cancer."3-'6
Thus in Western patients several factors indicate that an
aggressive surgical approach should be advocated, particularly
for fibrolamellar hepatocellular cancer. The problem is that few
authors have given guidelines on the resectability of liver
tumours. Specification of the criteria for resectability is even
more important now that liver transplantation is a possible option. Patients, particularly young ones, with irresectable primary
liver cell cancers are often said to be ideal candidates for liver
transplantation.'7 Although definitions of irresectability can be
found in reports on transplantation, such definitions are often
related to multicentric cancer and there is little precise information about extensive, apparently solitary lesions. Results after
transplantation for primary liver cancer are not uniformly
good, with survival times rarely exceeding two years."-20
Despite this many physicians and surgeons see liver transplantation as the only alternative in young patients with large liver
tumours. This view seems to be supported by the National
Institutes of Health consensus development conference statement on liver transplantation."
In view of these factors, and the fact that most patients with
primary liver tumours are usually seen by physicians, medical
gastroenterologists, or surgeons with relatively limited experience in hepatic surgery, we believe that it is important to show
that potentially curative surgery can be carried out for patients
with very large primary hepatocellular cancer, and that tumours
that seem irresectable on clinical and radiological grounds can
in fact be safely resected.

Patients and methods
Thirty six patients with primary liver cancer have been evaluated in
the hepatobiliary unit at this hospital since May 1979. All were
referred from other hospitals in the United Kingdom or abroad.
Twenty three patients were found to have irresectable tumours,
mostly because of multicentric disease shown at laparotomy or laparoscopy or by extensive radiological evaluation. Histopathological
diagnosis was obtained in all patients. Thirteen of these patients (five
men, eight women; mean age 34, range 16-64) underwent hepatic
resection and form the basis of this report. Four of the patients were
admitted to hospital because of an abdominal mass and three because
of abdominal pain. A further three patients were admitted complaining
of anorexia, breathlessness, and tiredness. One patient was thought to
have hepatitis, and another presented with a paraneoplastic syndrome
(a tumour producing adrenocorticotrophic hormone). Pregnancy was
suspected in one girl owing to amenorrhoea, vomiting, and tiredness.

Scrupulous preoperative investigations were performed in all the
patients using ultrasonography, computed tomography, selective
coeliac and superior mesenteric angiography, indirect or direct
splenoportography, and inferior venacavography. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography was performed in patients with a history of
jaundice.
The anatomical description of the liver followed the classification of
Couinaud.22 The division between the left and right lobes of the liver
(the principal scissura or Cantlie's line) was assessed by drawing a line
through the gall bladder and inferior vena cava on a computed
tomogram that permitted visualisation of both markers.23 The angiographic and phlebographic findings were as reported by the radiologist.
Results
LABORATORY FINDINGS
Table I shows the mean values and the proportion of patients with
abnormal test results. Although the results of liver function tests were
abnormal in most patients, the mean values indicated that the abnormalities were modest. No patient was positive for hepatitis B
antigen, and only two had a raised a fetoprotein concentration. Plasma
neurotensin concentrations were raised in five of seven patients in
whom they were measured preoperatively.
RADIOLOGY
Table II summarises the combined radiological findings for each
patient related to the location of the tumour, its maximal diameter,
and whether it was single or multiple. Seven of the tumours affected
both the right and left lobes of the liver. Invasion of the main portal
vein was suspected in two patients while two patients had invasion or
severe compression of the right branch of the portal vein and seven
patients of the left branch of the portal vein. Seven patients had
severe compression or displacement, or both, of the inferior vena cava.
Six patients had invasion or compression, or both, of one main branch
of the portal vein and of the inferior vena cava. Extrahepatic spread
was suspected in three patients. As an example of the radiological
features in this group the figure shows the findings in one of the
patients (case 5).
The mean diameter of the tumours was 13 cm (range 7-18 cm).
Many of the tumours had a clear cut margin separating them from the
normal liver tissue, suggesting that they were growing by pushing and
by compressing and displacing adjacent structures rather than by
invading them.

Typical radiological findings (case 5). (a) Computed tomogram showing mainly left sided tumour but extending into right liver. (b) Hepatic arteriogram
showing highly vascular tumour with arterial supply from both left and right hepatic arteries. (c) Indirect portal venography showing displacement of
main and right portal veins and obstruction (middle arrow) of left portal vein. (d) Extrinsic displacement and obstruction (arrows) of inferior vena cava
at level of liver with established collateral circulation.
SURGICAL TREATMENT
Table III shows the type and extent of the resections performed.
Interestingly, only two of the 13 patients underwent a classically described formal hepatic resection, the rest having extensive resections
crossing Cantlie's line and necessitating some form of extended resection. In particular, seven of the patients had primarily left sided
lesions, and six of these underwent extended left hepatic lobectomy as
suggested by Couinaud.2 (There are few records of this operation,
which has been rarely carried out.24 25) Two of the patients had their
tumours embolised before surgery to reduce vascularity and size.
All but three of the operations were performed through a bilateral
subcostal abdominal incision. Of the remaining three patients, one
had a right chest extension and two a midline sternotomy. One patient
was operated on during liver vascular exclusion using cardiopulmonary
bypass. In no instance did the vascular invasion apparent during
the preoperative investigations preclude hepatic resection. No patient
in whom invasion ofthe inferior vena cava was suggested preoperatively
actually had direct invasion, although severe compression was apparent in all cases. Spread to the branches of the portal vein as suggested in preoperative studies was confirmed in all cases, and in two cases
the tumour extended into the main lumen of the portal vein at its
bifurcation. No direct spread to the main portal vein was found, the
changes observed preoperatively being due to compression rather
than invasion. Extrahepatic spread was verified in two cases, and
in a third the preoperative findings could not be confirmed.
Twelve of the 13 patients had curative resection-that is, macroscopic clearance of all tumour. In one patient (case 6) with a fibrolamellar
hepatoma extended resection was performed despite regional lymph
node metastases.
MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY
Seven of the patients had complications related to the operation,
two of whom required a second laparotomy (one for bleeding and one
for drainage of an infected collection). Four patients had a biliary
fistula, but in all it closed spontaneously within six weeks. There were
no intraoperative deaths or deaths in hospital within 30 days.

PATHOLOGY
All the patients had primary hepatocellular cancer except one, in
whom difficulty was experienced in histological classification: the
tumour presented with a paraneoplastic syndrome, which was
probably a primary hepatocellular cancer secreting adrenocorticotrophic hormone. Seven of the patients had fibrolamellar hepatocellular
carcinoma and the rest well to moderately well differentiated tumours.
No patient had cirrhosis of the liver.
FOLLOW UP
Follow up varied from six months to almost six years (table III).
All seven patients with fibrolamellar hepatoma survived with a mean
follow up of 18 months (range 8-41 months). One of these was operated
on for removal of a recurrent tumour two years after the initial operation and was followed up for 17 months after the second operation.
Of the remaining six patients, two died at two and 35 months and the
four others survived with a mean follow up of 23 months (range 6-70
months).
Recurrence of tumour developed in the patient in whom a palliative
resection was performed and in one other patient. The nine other
surviving patients remained free of disease and returned to school or
work. Liver function tests yielded entirely normal results except in one
patient (case 12), in whom persistently raised alkaline phosphatase
activity was related to narrowing of the bile duct after an extended left
lobectomy.
Discussion
We do not suggest that this highly selected group of patients
who underwent resection for primary hepatocellular cancer are
representative of Western patients generally. Nevertheless,
the rate of resectability indicates that we have adopted an aggressive policy over the surgical treatment of primary hepatocellular
cancer. The patients were selected in that most were young,
none had cirrhotic livers, and metabolically they were good
candidates for surgery as shown by biochemical variables. On
the other hand, most had huge liver tumours, most of which were
regarded as inoperable by the referring institutions. Some were
referred after unsuccessful chemotherapy or for primary
devascularisation (embolisation) as palliative treatment.
Several factors should be remembered in cases of huge primary liver tumours. Firstly, the clinical course of hepatocellular
cancer shows that it remains confined to the liver for a long
period and that metastases occur late.2 8 Secondly, detailed
and elegant anatomical studies have defined the anatomy of the
liver and thus provided surgeons with a framework for safe
operations. Thirdly, the liver has enormous potential to regenerate after resection.'6 We agree with Foster27 and Starzl
et al" that in the non-cirrhotic liver concern about the size of
the remnant should rarely compromise a decision to proceed
with resection. The neoplastic tissue is non-functioning parenchyma, indicating that a large tumour in a patient who is
metabolically fit and does not have underlying cirrhosis can
almost certainly be safely resected. Hepatic failure after resection
in the non-cirrhotic liver is always related to compromised
circulation of the remaining liver tissue.9 Fourthly, the size of
the liver tumour per se seems not to be a prognostic indicator.'8
In particular, a clear cut tumour margin indicates a lesion growing and compressing adjacent structures with displacement
should encourage the surgeon.
Thus, obviously, precise criteria of resectability are of paramount importance. Two basic aspects require discussionnamely, the size and location of the tumour, and vascular and
extrahepatic invasion. It is clear that distant metastases preclude
surgical treatment, and it is also generally accepted that major
resection in a cirrhotic liver is not justified. On the other hand,
large size on its own is not a criterion for irresectability.9 25
Several authors state that invasion of both main liver lobes is a
contraindication to resection.'" 28 We cannot agree with such
categorical statements. Indeed, if we had adopted such criteria
BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL VOLUME 291 28 SEPTEMBER 1985
most of our patients would have been deemed to have irresectable tumours as computed tomography showed that the tumours
crossed Cantlie's line. Thus, instead of confining resectability
to the main hepatic lobes, we should like to introduce the term
"resectable area." This term is clearly correlated to detailed
knowledge ol the segmental and vascular anatomy of the liver.
We would agree with Lee et all that resection should not be
precluded by the finding of multiple tumour nodules so long as
these are located within a resectable area or if it can be combined
with segmental wedge resection of apparently isolated lesions,
as was done in one of our patients.
Several authors have stated that invasion of inflow and outflow
vessels constitutes the most important criterion for irresectability.2 29 The definition of invasion, however, is difficult and
not without hazards. It is evident from this study that if one
main portal branch is affected, whether by severe compression,
obstruction, or direct invasion, this can be safely dealt with if
it is within the area to be resected. The second point is that
presumed invasion of the main trunk of the portal vein or of the
inferior vena cava as shown by preoperative radiology proved to
be fallacious in several cases. Thus a tumour should not be
deemed irresectable on angiographic or phlebographic criteria
alone. Indeed, operative techniques are now available to deal
with invasion of the portal vein and inferior vena cava." 21
Tsuzuki et al recently reported removal of tumour thrombi in five
of 41 patients who underwent resection,8 and we described excision of a portal venous segment with reconstruction." Even
segments of the retrohepatic inferior vena cava can be excised
without replacement,33 and direct invasion of adjacent organs
should not preclude resection.8 Such statements do not negate
the great value of preoperative angiographic studies but simply
indicate that improvement in technique and the interpretation
of such studies is needed.
Is extensive surgical intervention justified? Morbidity and
mortality figures would seem to furnish adequate grounds for
such an approach. Although the morbidity was high, most of the
complications were minor and easily managed. When only
the serious complications of infection and bleeding were considered the incidence of complications was 23%, which is
comparable with that found by other authors,' 8 29 although
comparison is often difficult owing to differing patient populations. Biliary fistula is a risk of extended left hepatic lobectomy,25
and indeed four of our patients undergoing this operation had
biliary fistulisation.
No patient died in the postoperative period (30 days), indicating that major resection may be undertaken without undue risk.
Secondly, the follow up data seemed to justify aggressive surgical efforts. This is in keeping with other published data with
median survival exceeding two years and a five year survival of
roughly 25%.8 9 12 28 The third point is the recognition of the
fibrolamellar variety of hepatocellular carcinoma."3 14 This
tumour has a favourable prognosis34 and should be suspected
in young patients with large liver tumours, a normal ax fetoprotein concentration, and non-cirrhotic livers. Seven of our patients
mean age 22, range 16-32) had tumours of this variety. In this
group of patients even removal of recurrences can be successful,
as shown in one of our cases.
The results after resection are better than those after liver
transplantation. One of the great difficulties in selecting patients
for transplantation is that resectability for such large lesions is
usually determined only at the time of laparotomy, although all
our patients in whom resection was planned preoperatively
did undergo resection. Nevertheless, patients submitted for
laparotomy and extensive dissection and then found to have
irresectable tumours and subsequently referred for transplantation would present the transplant surgeon with a more difficult
problem. On the other hand, should transplantation be decided
on preoperatively, a donor liver procured, and the abdomen
opened, transplantation rather than resection will probably be
proceeded with. Taking into account the fact that in our
experience carefully selected candidates submitted for
laparotomy all underwent resection, we believe that patientsProtected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies.

with large, apparently solitary primary liver cell tumours in
non-cirrhotic livers should be considered firstly for resection
and only secondarily for liver transplantation.

Abstract
A study was made of the changes in the treatment of
hypertension, in the effectiveness of that treatment, and
in mortality from cerebrovascular stroke in men and
women in two counties in Finland. One of these counties
was North Karelia, where a comprehensive cardiovascular programme based in the community had been
launched in 1972. Cross sectional surveys in large
representative samples of the middle aged populations
were carried out in 1972, 1977, and 1982. Average annual
mortality from stroke adjusted for age was calculated
for the two year periods 1971-2, 1977-8, and 1980-1.

The proportion of hypertensive men being effectively
treated for their hypertension increased in both areas
from 1972 to 1977 and further from 1977 to 1982. Mortality
from stroke in middle aged men decreased in both areas
during both observation periods. The proportion of
hypertensive women being effectively treated greatly
increased in both areas from 1972 to 1977. This was
associated with a large decline in mortality from stroke.
In North Karelia the proportion of women being effectively treated was remarkably high but decreased somewhat between 1977 and 1982; this decrease was associated
with an increase in mortality from stroke in the women
aged 35-64.
These results support the idea that effective antihypertensive treatment in the community is a major
determinant of mortality from stroke in both men and
women.
Introduction
The fact that high blood pressure is the most important risk
factor in cerebrovascular stroke has been well documented both
in Finland1 2 and elsewhere.'7 Several clinical trials have
shown that the risk of stroke can be reduced by lowering blood
pressure in hypertensive patients by treatment with antihypertensive drugs.8 -14 Reducing the risk of stroke has been a major
argument for recommending and implementing large scale,
