Abstract
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects over 170 million people worldwide and is the leading cause of chronic liver diseases, including
cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer. Available antiviral therapies cause severe side effects and are effective only for a
subset of patients, though treatment outcomes have recently been improved by the combination therapy now including
boceprevir and telaprevir, which inhibit the viral NS3/4A protease. Despite extensive efforts to develop more potent nextgeneration protease inhibitors, however, the long-term efficacy of this drug class is challenged by the rapid emergence of
resistance. Single-site mutations at protease residues R155, A156 and D168 confer resistance to nearly all inhibitors in
clinical development. Thus, developing the next-generation of drugs that retain activity against a broader spectrum of
resistant viral variants requires a comprehensive understanding of the molecular basis of drug resistance. In this study, 16
high-resolution crystal structures of four representative protease inhibitors – telaprevir, danoprevir, vaniprevir and MK-5172
– in complex with the wild-type protease and three major drug-resistant variants R155K, A156T and D168A, reveal unique
molecular underpinnings of resistance to each drug. The drugs exhibit differential susceptibilities to these protease variants
in both enzymatic and antiviral assays. Telaprevir, danoprevir and vaniprevir interact directly with sites that confer resistance
upon mutation, while MK-5172 interacts in a unique conformation with the catalytic triad. This novel mode of MK-5172
binding explains its retained potency against two multi-drug-resistant variants, R155K and D168A. These findings define the
molecular basis of HCV N3/4A protease inhibitor resistance and provide potential strategies for designing robust therapies
against this rapidly evolving virus.

Introduction
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a genetically diverse positive-stranded
RNA virus of the Flaviviridae family infecting an estimated 170
million people worldwide [1,2]. Based on genetic diversity, HCV is
divided into six major genotypes (genotypes 1–6) and numerous
subtypes with different geographic distributions; genotypes 1 and 3
are the most prevalent worldwide [3]. HCV infection is the leading
cause of chronic liver disease that persists for decades and eventually
progresses to cirrhosis, liver failure, or liver cancer [4]. The current
anti-HCV standard of care is a combination of pegylated interferon
(Peg-IFN), ribavirin (RBV), and boceprevir or telaprevir, two
recently approved antiviral agents targeting the viral NS3/4A
protease [5]. Sustained virologic response (SVR) –which is
tantamount to cure–is achieved only in a subset of treated patients,
depending on a combination of viral and host-cell genetic factors
[6–10]. For example, a human polymorphism at the IL28B gene is
associated with poor interferon response [11]. Most patients
undergoing interferon-based therapies also experience significant
adverse effects, including flu-like symptoms, anemia, and depression
[12]. Thus, current anti-HCV therapies are often not tolerated and
ineffective for many patients, and novel direct-acting antiviral drugs
are required for safer, more efficacious treatment.
Direct-acting antiviral agents have the potential to improve
SVR rates and minimize treatment duration. The HCV NS3/4A
protease – a chymotrypsin-like serine protease – is a prime
therapeutic target that cleaves four known sites along the virally
encoded polyprotein [13]. The NS3/4A protease also hydrolyzes
two human proteins, TRIF and MAVS, which are part of the
innate immune system, thereby confounding the innate immune
response to viral infection [14,15]. Pharmaceutical companies
have invested significant effort in developing NS3/4A protease
inhibitors. Proof-of-concept of antiviral efficacy was first demonstrated in 2002 with the macrocyclic inhibitor BILN-2061
(ciluprevir) [16,17], which was later discontinued due to concerns
about its cardiotoxicity [18]. As noted above, boceprevir [19] and
telaprevir [20,21] are two NS3/4A protease inhibitors recently
approved by the Food and Drug Administration, marking an
important milestone in anti-HCV research and drug development

over the past two decades. Both boceprevir and telaprevir are
linear ketoamide compounds that form a reversible, covalent bond
with the catalytic serine of NS3/4A protease. Several non-covalent
xprotease inhibitors have also advanced into human clinical trials;
these inhibitors include both linear (BMS-650032 [22], BI 201335
[23]) and macrocyclic compounds, containing either a P1–P3
(danoprevir [24], TMC435 [25]) or a P2–P4 (vaniprevir [26], MK5172 [27]) macrocycle (Figure 1).
The NS3/4A protease inhibitors rapidly reduce HCV RNA
titers when administered as monotherapy [17,28–31] and
substantially improve SVR rates when given in combination with
Peg-IFN and RBV [6–10,32–34]. However, the high rate of HCV
replication and poor fidelity of HCV’s RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase lead to heterogeneous virus populations in infected
patients [35,36]. These viral quasispecies exist at low levels in
untreated patients, and resistant populations emerge under the
selective pressure of direct-acting antiviral agents [36–38]. In the
majority of patients undergoing protease inhibitor therapy,
resistance develops rapidly due to overlapping but distinct sets of
NS3/4A mutations [37]. In patients with genotype 1a, the R155K
mutation causes resistance against nearly all inhibitors, but rarely
occurs in genotype 1b patients [29,30,32,37–42]. Instead, distinct
resistance mutations arise in genotype 1b patients depending on
the class of protease inhibitor used; A156 mutates in response to
treatment with linear ketoamide protease inhibitors [39–41], while
macrocyclic inhibitors more commonly select for D168A and
R155K variants [29,30,32,42]. Mutations at V36, T54, and
V36+A155 are also associated with resistance to ketoamide
inhibitors [39–41]. Variations in the patterns of resistant mutations
arise from the complex interplay between genotype, replication
rates, mutation rates, and the resulting effect of mutations on viral
fitness and drug potency. Clearly, despite the benefits of
combination therapy in improving SVR rates, the emergence of
resistance challenges the long-term efficacy of NS3/4A protease
inhibitors.
Most primary drug-resistance mutations in NS3/4A protease
occur around the active site in regions where drugs protrude from
the substrate binding space, defined as the substrate envelope,
because these changes can preferentially disrupt drug binding
with minimal effect on substrate binding and viral fitness [43].
The protease inhibitors danoprevir, TMC435, and boceprevir
protrude from the substrate envelope in regions that correlate
with known sites of resistance mutations. Notably, the large P2
moieties of danoprevir and TMC435 bind in the S2 subsite and
extensively interact with residues R155, D168, and A156 [43],
which mutate to confer multi-drug resistance [37,38,44]. These
and other inhibitors with large P2 moieties derive much of their
potency from binding in the S2 subsite [45], but how molecular
changes at these residues selectively weaken inhibitor binding
without compromising the binding of viral substrates is not clear.
Elucidating the underlying molecular mechanisms of NS3/4A
protease inhibitor resistance is therefore essential for developing
new drugs that are less susceptible to resistance.
How single-site mutations at residues R155, A156 and D168
confer resistance against most protease inhibitors has not been
elucidated in atomic detail. In this study, we report that four
chemically representative protease inhibitors – telaprevir, danoprevir, vaniprevir and MK-5172 – exhibit distinct susceptibilities
to the protease variants R155K, A156T and D168A (Table 1).
Sixteen high-resolution crystal structures of inhibitors in complexwith the wild-type protease and three drug resistant variants
reveal the molecular basis underlying the unique resistance
profiles of these inhibitors (Table 2). The P2 quinoxaline moiety
of MK-5172 stacks against the protease catalytic triad in a novel
conformation, explaining its retained potency against R155K and
D168A. The flexible P2 isoindoline moiety of danoprevir
containing a P1–P3 macrocycle packs against the mutated
surfaces of A156T and D168A variants, explaining its relatively
higher activity against both protease variants. However, the
isoindoline moiety in vaniprevir is constrained due to the P2–P4
macrocycle, resulting in significantly lower activity against all
three variants. Thus, incorporating either quinoxaline or flexible
substituents at the P2 proline confers clear advantages. Taken
together, these data highlight potential strategies for designing
novel drugs that retain potency against a broader spectrum of
resistant viral variants.
Results
Drug susceptibility assays
Drug activities were determined for telaprevir, danoprevir,
vaniprevir and MK-5172 against wild-type genotype 1a HCV
and resistant variants R155K, D168A, and A156T using viral
replicon-based inhibition assays. The antiviral activities against
the resistant variants trended with changes in binding affinities
measured in enzyme inhibition assays (Table 1). Against wild-type
protease, macrocyclic inhibitors danoprevir, vaniprevir and MK5172 exhibited antiviral potencies in the sub nM range
(IC50 = 0.24, 0.34 and 0.11 nM, respectively), while telaprevir
potency was significantly lower (IC50= 1030 nM), consistent with
previous reports [46,47]. Relative to the wild type, R155K caused
large reductions in potency for danoprevir and vaniprevir, but
MK-5172 remained highly active (R155K IC50= 0.55 nM).
Telaprevir potency was slightly better against D168A relative to
the wild type, while danoprevir, vaniprevir and MK-5172 lost
100- to 1000-fold potency against D168A. However, both
danoprevir and MK-5172 still were significantly more potent
than telaprevir against D168A. Among the macrocyclic drugs,
danoprevir and MK-5172 retained higher activities against
D168A (D168A IC50 = 48 nM and 13 nM, respectively) relative
to vaniprevir (D168A IC50.400 nM). Danoprevir also retained
significantly higher potency against A156T (A156T
IC50= 5.7 nM), while the other three drugs incurred large-fold
Author Summary
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects over 170 million people
worldwide and is the leading cause of chronic liver diseases,
including cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer. New classes
of directly-acting antiviral agents that target various HCV
enzymes are being developed. Two such drugs that target
the essential HCV NS3/4A protease are approved by the
FDA and several others are at various stages of clinical
development. These drugs, when used in combination with
pegylated interferon and ribavirin, significantly improve
treatment outcomes. However HCV evolves very quickly
and drug resistance develops against directly-acting antiviral agents. Thus, despite the therapeutic success of NS3/4A
protease inhibitors, their long-term effectiveness is challenged by drug resistance. Our study explains in atomic
detail how and why drug resistance occurs for four
chemically representative protease inhibitors –telaprevir,
danoprevir, vaniprevir and MK-5172. Potentially with this
knowledge, new drugs could be developed that are less
susceptible to drug resistance. More generally, understanding the underlying mechanisms by which drug resistance
occurs can be incorporated in drug development to many
quickly evolving diseases.

Figure 1. The chemical structures of NS3/4A protease inhibitors. The canonical nomenclature for drug moiety positioning is indicated using
telaprevir. Telaprevir (black), danoprevir (red), vaniprevir and MK-5172 (blue) are representative of many other protease inhibitors in development.
Telaprevir, recently approved for clinical use, is an acyclic ketoamide inhibitor that forms a reversible, covalent bond with the protease. Danoprevir,
currently in phase II clinical trials, is a non-covalent acylsulfonamide inhibitor with a P1–P3 macrocycle. Vaniprevir and MK-5172 are also non-covalent
acylsulfonamide inhibitors, but contain P2–P4 macrocycles. Vaniprevir and MK-5172 differ in the construction of their P2 moieties: vaniprevir contains
a carbamate linkage between the P2 proline and the isoindoline moiety, whereas MK-5172 contains a shorter ether linkage between its P2 proline
and the quinoxaline moiety.

losses in potency. Notably, MK-5172, though active against the
other two variants, lost significant potency against A156T
(A156T IC50 = 108 nM). Thus, the four drugs exhibited varied
susceptibilities to protease inhibitor-resistant viral variants
R155K, D168A and A156T.
Structure determination and analyses
To elucidate the underlying mechanism by which chemically
diverse inhibitors bind to the wild-type protease and drug-resistant
variants, crystal structures were determined for 16 inhibitorprotease complexes. These complexes include wild-type protease
and resistant variants R155K, D168A and A156T each bound to
telaprevir, danoprevir, vaniprevir and MK-5172, with resolutions
ranging from 1.10–2.50 A˚ (Table 2); S139A protease variants were
used except for telaprevir, which requires covalent bond formation
with the serine 139 for efficient binding. These high-resolution
data sets afforded very detailed structural interpretations of drugprotease binding.
The binding conformations of telaprevir, danoprevir, vaniprevir
and MK-5172 to the wild-type protease are shown in Figure 2 and
Figure S1. In all complexes, inhibitors formed three common
hydrogen bonds with the protease backbone (Table S1): (1) the P1
amide nitrogen with the carbonyl oxygen of R155, (2) the P3
carbonyl oxygen with the amide nitrogen of A157, and (3) the P3
amide nitrogen with the carbonyl oxygen of A157 (Figures 3A–
6A). The P5 amide nitrogen of telaprevir formed an additional
hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of S159. In the telaprevir
complex, the catalytic serine (S139) was covalently bound to the Ca carbon of the ketoamide warhead. The ketoamide oxygen sat in
the oxyanion hole and interacted with the backbone amide
nitrogens of protease residues 137–139, while the Ne nitrogen of
H57 hydrogen bonded with the keto oxygen. The acylsulfonamide
groups of danoprevir, vaniprevir and MK-5172 were also
positioned in the oxyanion hole, hydrogen bonding with the same
set of backbone amide nitrogens, as observed previously for the
TMC435 and danoprevir structures [43,45]. Meanwhile the Ne
nitrogen of H57 interacted with the sulfonamide nitrogen in these
complexes, suggesting that the Ne atoms were deprotonated.
Thus, many of these classes of inhibitors overlap in several key
interactions with the protease.
In wild-type complexes involving macrocyclic inhibitors, R155
adopted a conformation distinct from those observed in telaprevir
and substrate complexes to allow binding of the extended P2
moieties in the S2 subsite. This R155 conformation is stabilized by
hydrogen bond interactions involving D168 and D80. The
conformation has also been observed for protease in complex
with TMC435 and danoprevir, where large P2 moieties of
inhibitors are positioned over the guanidine side chain, making
extensive cation-p stacking interactions [43,45]. Vaniprevir, with
the P2 isoindoline moiety, bound in a conformation similar to
danoprevir, making favorable cation-p stacking interactions with
R155, despite the P2–P4 macrocycle. In contrast, MK5172
adopted a novel conformation with the ether-linked P2 quinoxaline moiety not interacting extensively with R155 and D168, but
stacking instead against H57 and D81 of the catalytic triad
(Figure 2). Thus, the P2 moieties of these three macrocycles pack
in a variety of conformations around the active site.
To characterize binding patterns of the drugs relative to natural
substrates, the wild-type drug complexes were analyzed with
respect to the substrate envelope, the consensus binding volume of
the substrates [43] (Figures 3A–6A). Inhibitors are generally more
vulnerable to resistance where they protrude beyond the substrate
envelope and contact residues less essential for substrate recognition and turnover. All four drugs protruded from the substrate
envelope in the protease S2 subsite near residues R155, A156 and
D168, which individually mutate to confer multi-drug resistance
[37,38,44]. Telaprevir, with the small P2 cyclopentylproline
moiety, made fewer van der Waals contacts with R155, A156
and D168 relative to danoprevir and vaniprevir, which contain the
carbamate-linked P2 isoindoline moieties that protruded from the
substrate envelope and made extensive van der Waals contacts
with these residues (Figures 3A–5A). Danoprevir’s isoindoline
moiety bound in two conformations in the wild-type complex, but
adopted a single conformation in mutant complexes. Notably MK5172, with an ether-linked P2 quinoxaline moiety, while protruding from the substrate envelope, stacked against the catalytic triad,
avoiding direct van der Waals contact with R155 and D168
(Figure 6A). Thus, although each of these drugs protruded from
the substrate envelope at the S2 subsite, each formed unique
interactions with R155, A156 and D168. Mutations at these
residues therefore differentially affected drug binding and potency,
resulting in a distinct resistance profile for each inhibitor.
Telaprevir resistance
Telaprevir lost potency against R155K compared to the wildtype protease, although the crystal structures of both complexes
were very similar maintaining the covalent bond between the
ketoamide moiety and the catalytic serine (Figure 3B). R155K,
however, lost interactions with D168, thereby disrupting the
electrostatic network spanning R123, D168, R155 and D81,
which is important for telaprevir binding. These rearrangements
modulated the charge landscape along the protease surface,
disrupting interactions with the adjacent P2 cyclopentylproline
and P4 cyclohexylalanine moieties of telaprevir, consistent with
previous modeling studies [48]. Interestingly, telaprevir showed
better potency against the D168A variant than the wild-type; the
crystal structure revealed that the P2 moiety bent considerably and
packed closer against the D168A variant. The inhibitor shifted by
approximately 0.5 A˚ relative the position in the wild-type
complex, resulting in increased interactions with both R155 and
A156 (Figures 3C, 7A). However, the A156T mutation resulted in
a steric clash with telaprevir’s P2 moiety, causing the inhibitor to
shift significantly; the inhibitor P2 moiety moved away from R155,
losing van der Waals interactions with the protease (Figures 3D,
7A). Notably, in the A156T-telaprevir complex the covalent bond
between the ketoamide warhead and the catalytic serine was
extended to greater than 2 A˚ , suggesting a reduced capacity for
covalent modification, consistent with the large loss in potency
against A156T (Table 1). Thus, while telaprevir’s flexibility allows
adaptation to D168A, it cannot accommodate the disruption by
R155K or A156T. The relatively weak binding affinity of
telaprevir to wild-type protease results in a potentially narrow
range by which resistant mutations can be tolerated.
Danoprevir and vaniprevir resistance
For both danoprevir and vaniprevir, the R155K mutation
disrupted the favorable cation-p stacking interactions with the P2
isoindoline moieties (Figure 4B), causing significant reductions in
drug potencies (Table 1). The D168A mutation also disrupted
stacking of the P2 moieties with R155, by disrupting the
electrostatic network and therefore the position of R155 for
optimal cation-p stacking. In danoprevir, the P2 isoindoline
moiety shifted in response to R155K and D168A mutations,
making extensive interactions with the catalytic D81 (Figure 7B).
For vaniprevir, the rigidity of the P2–P4 macrocycle prevented
similar compensatory changes (Figure 5C). Thus, D168A caused
losses in danoprevir and vaniprevir potency by disrupting cation-p
stacking. However, the flexibility of the P2 moiety of danoprevir

compensates somewhat for this loss, explaining danoprevir’s
greater potency against the D168A variant relative to vaniprevir
(Table 1).
The A156T mutation sterically impinges on the binding of
danoprevir and vaniprevir. In both complexes with A156T, the P2
moieties shifted toward the catalytic triad and lost cation-p
stacking interactions with R155. However, the flexibility of the P2
moiety of danoprevir permitted a larger shift, which allowed for
more compensatory packing against the A156T variant protease
surface (Figure 4D). In contrast, the P2–P4 macrocycle of
vaniprevir restrained the P2 moiety and inhibitor’s ability to
accommodate this steric burden, more strongly compromising the
activity of vaniprevir. Thus, the flexible P2 moiety of danoprevir
allowed it to retain significant potency against A156T variants
compared to vaniprevir.
MK-5172 resistance
Unlike in the danoprevir and vaniprevir complexes with wild
type, in the MK-5172-wild-type complex the P2 quinoxaline
moiety did not stack on R155 and interacted less with D168 and
the electrostatic network involving these residues. Thus, the singlesite mutations R155K and D168A only caused very subtle changes
in the MK-5172 binding conformations (Figures 6B and 6C). This
subtle effect is reflected in the small loss of potency against the
R155K variant (Table 1); however, MK-5172 exhibited 100-fold
lower potency against the D168A variant, likely due to less
extensive interactions with D81 and K136 relative to wild-type
and R155K (Figure 7). A156T, the worst of the resistance
mutations for MK-5172A, sterically clashed with the P2–P4
macrocycle and caused a large shift in the binding position away
from the catalytic triad relative to its wild-type structure
(Figure 6D). This altered binding of MK-5172 resulted in fewer
van der Waals contacts with D81 and R155, and is likely
responsible for 1000-fold lower potency against the A156T
variant. Overall, analysis of the four crystal structures explains
MK-5172’s significantly retained potency against R155K and
D168A as well as its loss of potency against the A156T variant due
to the rigidity of the macrocycle (Table 1).
Discussion
Despite the exciting therapeutic success of NS3/4A protease
inhibitors, their long-term effectiveness is challenged by drug
resistance. In this study we explain the molecular basis of this drug
resistance against four NS3/4A protease inhibitors, telaprevir,
danoprevir, vaniprevir and MK-5172, representing the major

chemical classes of these inhibitors. Our detailed analysis of 16
high-resolution crystal structures explains the loss of inhibitor
potency in the face of resistance mutations. This research supports
our substrate envelope model, which stipulates that inhibitors are
vulnerable to resistance where they contact protease residues
beyond the substrate-binding region and therefore are not essential
for substrate binding [43]. These sites can mutate with minimal
effect on protease function and viral fitness. Indeed, most
resistance mutations occur in regions where drugs protrude from
the substrate envelope, as these changes selectively disrupt drug
binding with minimal effect on substrate proteolysis.
The most potent of the NS3/4A protease inhibitors is MK5172. We report here, for the first time, a novel binding
conformation for MK-5172 in which the P2 quinoxaline moiety
binds far from the S2 subsite and instead stacks against the
catalytic residues H57 and D81. Unlike other inhibitors, MK5172
does not directly interact with R155 and D168, which mutate to
confer multi-drug resistance. This unique binding mode of MK5172 explains its significantly greater potency against R155K and
D168A variants compared to other inhibitors. MK-5172 has a
unique barrier to resistance, as neither catalytic residue (H57 or
D81) can tolerate mutation. This binding conformation of MKFigure 3. Stereo view of the telaprevir complexes. (A) Telaprevir bound to the wild-type protease with the substrate envelope in blue.

5172, combined with its picomolar binding affinity [27] (Table 2),
will likely allow it to retain potency against a broad array of
resistant viral variants and genotypes.
We define the structural basis for differential drug activities
against the resistant variants R155K, D168A, and A156T for four
major chemical classes of NS3/4A protease inhibitors. Telaprevir
has reduced potency against R155K due to loss of van der Waals
contacts but exhibits better potency against D168A as it allows
tighter packing in the S2 subsite. R155K and D168A mutations
confer danoprevir and vaniprevir resistance by disrupting favorable cation-p stacking interactions with R155. Interestingly, while
both drugs lose considerable potency against R155K, danoprevir
retains higher activity against D168A. This difference is likely due
to the flexible P2 isoindoline moiety of danoprevir, which lacks
P2–P4 cyclization and repacks against the D168A variant.
Similarly, vaniprevir and MK-5172 exhibit significantly lower
potency against the A156T variant due to direct steric clashes,
while danoprevir partially accommodates this steric burden by
repacking against the mutated surface. Thus, the flexibility of
danoprevir’s P2 isoindoline moiety allows it to retain activity

against two of the three major drug-resistant variants. Structural
analysis of the 16 protease-inhibitor complexes defines the role of
all three major drug-resistance mutations.
Our results also provide predictions of drug activities against
other HCV genotypes and resistant strains. Interestingly, NS3/4A
residues around the protease active site, including R155, A156,
and D168 are highly conserved except genotype 3 viruses which
contain the residues Q168 and T123, instead of D168 and R123
found in other genotypes (Figure S2). We predict that the terminal
amide group of Q168 will be unable to stabilize R155 for stacking
against the P2 moieties of danoprevir and vaniprevir, but may
interact with T123 instead. Thus, we expect that danoprevir and
vaniprevir will exhibit reduced potencies against genotype 3
viruses, while MK-5172 will remain fully active. Indeed,
danoprevir and vaniprevir were recently shown to have reduced
efficacy against genotype 3 viruses [49]. For genotype 1 strains,
our results indicate that MK-5172 is highly active against R155K
and D168A variants, while danoprevir is highly active against the
A156T variant and to a lesser extent against the D168A variant.
Thus, as new inhibitors are developed and HCV resistance testing
becomes more available, our findings can help guide anti-HCV
treatment regimens for individual patients.

Overall our findings correlate with resistance profiles observed
in clinical isolates. Most protease inhibitors select for R155K
variants in genotype 1a patients as only one nucleotide change is
required [29,30,32,37–42]. Genotype 1b patients presumably have
higher barriers to R155K resistance, requiring two nucleotide
substitutions; thus, mutations at A156 and D168 are more readily

observed in response to protease inhibitor treatment. The
resistance at R155K occurs due to reduced interactions in the
S2 subsite. Telaprevir and other linear ketoamide drugs select for
A156T variants [39–41] by direct steric clashes, while linear (BI
201335) and macrocyclic drugs (danoprevir, vaniprevir, TMC435)
with large P2 moieties select for D168A variants [29,30,32,42] by
disrupting favorable stacking interactions with R155. These data
also support the converse observation that D168A variants are
uncommon in patients treated with telaprevir as the drug can pack
tighter in the S2 subsite. Likewise, A156T variants are uncommon
in patients treated with macrocyclic drugs containing flexible P2
moieties due to drug repacking against the mutated protease
surface [29,30,32,42]. However, drugs such as vaniprevir and
MK-5172 containing P2–P4 cyclization likely select for the A156T
variant due to the rigidity of their P2 moieties. Whether A156T
variants will be found in clinical isolates, however, depends on
additional viral factors, such as relative differences in viral fitness
between A156T variants and other competing viral variants. Our
data thus provide a unique resource for preemptively predicting
resistance and choosing the most appropriate protease inhibitor to
treat HCV depending on the resistance profile of a particular
patient viral population. Whether or not specific mutations arise in
clinical isolates is ultimately determined by the complex interplay
between drug potency, viral fitness, and genetic barriers to
resistance. Thus, depending on the initial viral species altered
pathways to resistance will exist.
The crystal structures of these NS3/4A inhibitors also provide a
key resource to guide future strategies in drug design. The high
potency of MK-5172, for example, derives from interactions with
the essential catalytic triad residues, which cannot mutate without
severely disrupting viral fitness. In addition, flexible P2 drug
moieties – lacking P2–P4 macrocycles – mitigate losses in potency
to the A156T and D168A mutations. Similar chemical features
can be incorporated in future drugs to potentially evade resistance.
Specifically, novel protease inhibitors that incorporate flexible P2
moieties, such as quinoxaline or similar groups, could exploit
interactions with the essential catalytic residues and concurrently
minimize contact with the P2 subsite, thereby reducing their sensitivities to mutations at R155, D168 and A156T. Thus, our
findings suggest strategies for developing protease inhibitors that
retain activity against a wider spectrum of drug-resistant HCV
variants.
Materials and Methods
Inhibitor synthesis
Danoprevir, vaniprevir and MK-5172 were synthesized in
house following reported methods; danoprevir was prepared using
our convergent reaction sequence as described [43]; vaniprevir
and MK-5172 were prepared following the synthetic methods
reported by McCauley et al. [50] and Harper et al. [27],
respectively, with minor modifications. Telaprevir was purchased
from A ChemTek, Inc. (Worcester, MA).
Mutagenesis and gene information
The HCV genotype 1a NS3/4A protease gene described in a
Bristol-Meyers Squibb patent [51] was synthesized by GenScript
and cloned into the pET28a expression vector (Novagen). This
highly soluble single-chain construct of the genotype 1a NS3/4A
protease domain contains a fragment of the cofactor NS4A
covalently linked at the N-terminus [51]. A similar protease
construct exhibited catalytic activity comparable to that of the
authentic full-length protein [52]. All protease variants were
generated using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit
from Stratagene. The codon-optimized genotype 1a helicase
sequence (H77c) was cloned downstream to the protease gene to
generate the full-length protease construct. Geneious [53] was
used to generate the sequence alignment of the NS3/4A protease
domain from HCV genotypes 1–6.
Drug susceptibility assays
Single mutations (R155K, D168A, or A156T) were introduced
into the NS3 region of genotype 1a HCV Con1 luciferase reporter
replicon using the mega-primer method of mutagenesis [54].
Replicon RNA of each protease variant was introduced into Huh7
cells by electroporation. Replication was then assessed in the
presence of increasing concentrations of protease inhibitors
(telaprevir, danoprevir, vaniprevir or MK-5172) by measuring
luciferase activity (relative light units) 96 hours after electroporation. The drug concentrations required to inhibit replicon
replication by 50% (IC50) were calculated directly from the drug
inhibition curves.
Enzyme inhibition assays
For enzyme inhibition experiments, 5 nM of the genotype 1a
HCV NS3/4A protease domain was incubated with increasing
drug concentrations for 15 min (90 min for telaprevir) in 50 mM
Tris assay buffer (5% glycerol, 5 mM TCEP, 6 mM LDAO and
4% DMSO, pH 7.5). Proteolysis reactions were initiated by
adding 100 nM HCV NS3/4A substrate [Ac-DE-Dap(QXL520)-
EE-Abu-y-[COO]AS-C(5-FAMsp)-NH2] (AnaSpec) and monitored using the EnVision plate reader (Perkin Elmer) at excitation
and emission wavelengths of 485 nm and 530 nm, respectively.
The initial cleavage velocities were determined from sections of the
progress curves corresponding to less than 15% substrate cleavage.
Apparent inhibition constants (Ki
) were obtained by nonlinear
regression fitting to the Morrison equation of initial velocity versus
inhibitor concentration using Prism 5 (GraphPad Software). Data
for each drug were generated in triplicate and processed
independently to calculate the average inhibition constant and
standard deviation.
Expression and purification of NS3/4A protease
constructs
Protein expression and purification were carried out as
described [51,55]. Briefly, transformed BL21 (DE3) E. coli cells
were grown at 37uC and induced at an optical density of 0.6 by
adding 1 mM IPTG. Cells were harvested after 5 hours of
expression, pelleted, and frozen at 280uC for storage. Cell pellets
were thawed, resuspended in 5 mL/g of resuspension buffer
(50 mM phosphate buffer, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mM bME, pH 7.5) and lysed with a cell disruptor. The soluble fraction
was retained, applied to a nickel column (Qiagen), washed with
resuspension buffer, and eluted with resuspension buffer supplemented with 200 mM imidazole. The eluent was dialyzed
overnight (MWCO 10 kD) to remove the imidazole, and the
His-tag was simultaneously removed with thrombin treatment.

The nickel-purified protein was then flash-frozen and stored at
280uC.
Crystallization of inhibitor complexes
The above-mentioned protein solution was thawed, concentrated to ,3 mg/mL and loaded on a HiLoad Superdex75 16/
60 column equilibrated with gel filtration buffer (25 mM MES,
500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 30 mM zinc chloride, and 2 mM
DTT, pH 6.5). The protease fractions were pooled and
concentrated to 20–25 mg/mL with an Amicon Ultra-15
10 kD device (Millipore). The concentrated samples were
incubated for 1 hour with 1–3 molar excess of inhibitor.
Diffraction-quality crystals were obtained overnight by mixing
equal volume of concentrated protein solution with precipitant
solution (20–26% PEG-3350, 0.1 M sodium MES buffer, 4%
ammonium sulfate, pH 6.5) in 24-well VDX hanging drop trays.
Crystallization, data collection and structure solution
X-ray diffraction data were collected at Advanced Photon
Source LS-CAT 21-ID-F, GM/CA-CAT 23-ID-D or with the
in-house RAXIS IV X-ray system. Diffraction intensities were
indexed, integrated and scaled using the program HKL2000
[56]. All structure solutions were generated using simple
isomorphous molecular replacement with PHASER [57]. The
B chain model of viral substrate product 4A4B (3M5M) [43] was
used as the starting model for all structure solutions. Initial
refinement was carried out in the absence of modeled ligand,
which was subsequently built in during later stages of refinement.
Subsequent crystallographic refinement was carried out within
the CCP4 program suite, with iterative rounds of TLS and
restrained refinement until convergence was achieved [58]. The
protein crystals of the wild-type protease and drug-resistant
variants R155K and D168A in complex with MK-5172 grew as
pseudo-merohedral twins. Amplitude-based twinned refinement
was carried out during restrained refinement for all pseudomerohedral twins. The final structures were evaluated with
MolProbity [59] prior to deposition in the Protein Data Bank.
To limit the possibility of model bias throughout the refinement
process, 5% of the data were reserved for the free R-value
calculation [60]. Interactive model building and electron density
viewing was carried out using the program COOT [61].
Fobs2Fcalc ligand omit maps were generated with the ligand
excluded from the phase calculation using the program PHENIX
[62].
Inhibitor complex analysis
Superpositions were performed in PyMOL [63] using the Ca
atoms of the active site protease residues 137–139 and 154–160.
The wild-type-danoprevir complex was used as the reference
structure for each alignment. The NS3/4A viral substrate
envelope was computed as described using the full-length NS3/
4A structure (1CU1) [64] and product complexes 4A4B (3M5M),
4B5A (3M5N) and 5A5B (3M5O) [43].
Van der Waals contact energy
Van der Waals contact energies between protease residues and
peptide products were computed using a simplified Lennard-Jones
potential as described [65]. Briefly, the Lennard-Jones potential (Vr)
was calculated for each protease-drug atom pair where r, e and s
represent the interatomic distance, vdW well depth, and atomic
diameter, respectively:
Vr~4 e s
r
 12
{ s
r
 6  
Vr was computed for all possible protease-drug atom pairs within
5 A˚ , and potentials for non-bonded pairs separated by less than the
distance at the minimum potential were equated to 2e.
