This review focuses on the pathological features of
dysplasia in Barrett’s oesophagus. Two categorisation
schemes are used for grading dysplasia in the
gastrointestinal tract, including Barrett’s oesophagus. The
inflammatory bowel disease dysplasia morphology study
group system is the one most commonly used in the USA.
However, some European and most far Eastern countries
use the Vienna classification system, which uses the term
‘‘non-invasive neoplasia’’ instead of low-grade dysplasia
(LGD) or high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and also uses the
term ‘‘suspicious for invasive carcinoma’’ for lesions that
show equivocal cytological or architectural features of
tissue invasion. The degree of dysplasia is based on a
combination of cytological and architectural atypia.
However, the precise number of HGD crypts that is
necessary to upgrade a biopsy from LGD to HGD has
never been investigated and varies widely among expert
gastrointestinal pathologists. The extent of dysplasia,
particularly LGD, has also been recognised recently as an
important prognostic parameter in Barrett’s oesophagus.
Other problematic areas of dysplasia interpretation include
differentiation of regenerating epithelium versus LGD and
separating HGD from carcinoma. Dysplasia associated
with macroscopically visible lesions, such as ulcers, nodules
or polyps, carry a high risk of synchronous or
metachronous adenocarcinoma. Recently, immunostaining
for a-methylacyl-CoA-racemase has been shown to have a
high degree of specificity for detection of dysplasia in
Barrett’s oesophagus and may be used to help distinguish
negative from positive biopsies in this condition. In this
review, the problematic areas in dysplasia interpretation
are outlined and a specific approach to these issues is
discussed.

Worldwide, there are two classification
systems used for dysplasia in the
gastrointestinal tract (table 1) including
Barrett’s oesophagus.1 2 In 1983, the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) dysplasia morphology
study group classified dysplasia as negative,
indefinite or positive (low or high grade), which
is the system used most commonly in the USA.2
Recently, the World Health Organization proposed that the term ‘‘dysplasia’’ be replaced by
‘‘intraepithelial neoplasia’’, but this new term
has yet to gain popularity when used in reference
to preneoplastic conditions of the gastrointestinal tract.3 Some European and most far Eastern
countries use the Vienna classification, but it has
not gained widespread acceptance in the USA.1
The Vienna system (table 1) is similar to the one
proposed by the IBD dysplasia morphology study
group except that it uses the term ‘‘non-invasive
neoplasia’’ instead of low-grade or high-grade
dysplasia and also uses the term ‘‘suspicious for
invasive carcinoma’’ for lesions that show
equivocal cytological or architectural features of
tissue invasion. The Vienna system was developed to reduce the widely recognised discrepancies in interpretation of dysplasia between
Western and Japanese pathologists and in an
effort to reach a consensus on the nomenclature
of gastrointestinal neoplasia. Briefly, the basis of
the differences in interpretation relates to the
fact that Western pathologists define carcinoma
as lesions that show histological evidence of
penetration beyond the basement membrane
into the lamina propria or submucosa, whereas
many Japanese pathologists diagnose carcinoma
on the basis of cytological changes, in conjunction with architectural changes, without the
need to accurately show invasion beyond the
basement membrane. Unfortunately, as outlined
later, there is a high level of intraobserver and
interobserver variability with regard to the
pathological categorisation of dysplasia using
both these systems, and particularly for epithelial
lesions that show borderline features between
regeneration and low-grade dysplasia (LGD).146
Fortunately, in both systems, the detection of
clinically relevant high-grade lesions and carcinoma shows a much higher level of consistency
in interpretation among pathologists.
This review focuses on my personal approach
to the diagnosis and grading of dysplasia in
Barrett’s oesophagus, which is based on published data and on my experience as a highly
referral-based and dedicated gastrointestinal
pathologist with a longstanding research interest
in Barrett’s oesophagus. However, as a prelude to
this review, it is worth noting that although
morphological detection of dysplasia in mucosal
biopsy specimens currently serves as the best
method (biomarker) of detecting patients at
increased risk of cancer in Barrett’s oesophagus,
it has limitations.7 11 One limitation relates to the
inadequacy of the currently accepted definition
of dysplasia as ‘‘unequivocal neoplastic epithelium confined to the basement membrane’’. In

fact, it is often difficult, morphologically, to recognise
‘‘atypical’’ epithelium as unequivocally neoplastic because
of overlapping histological features with epithelial regenerative changes. Furthermore, it is also often difficult to
determine, with complete certainty, whether a focus of
neoplastic epithelium has, in fact, breached the basement
membrane and invaded the lamina propria. Finally, there is
abundant evidence to suggest that non-dysplastic (metaplastic) epithelium in Barrett’s oesophagus possesses many of the
biological characteristics of ‘‘neoplastic’’ epithelium, the nondysplastic epithelium being defined as a clonal proliferation
of cells with loss of the normal capacity for regulation of cell
proliferation and differentiation.7 12 Thus, dysplasia is a
disease in need of redefinition, particularly as it relates to
the development of cancer in Barrett’s oesophagus.
Pathological features of dysplasia in Barrett’s
oesophagus
Negative for dysplasia
A diagnosis of ‘‘negative for dysplasia’’ is applied to cases that
show metaplastic columnar epithelium with regenerative
changes. Unfortunately, on occasion, epithelial regenerative
changes may be extreme, particularly in mucosa adjacent to
the neo-squamocolumnar junction or in which active
inflammation or ulceration is present. In my experience,
the tendency among surgical pathologists to overinterpret
regenerative changes as indicative of dysplasia is often due to
a lack of awareness of the wide spectrum of ‘‘atypia’’ that
may occur in patients with Barrett’s oesophagus, particularly
those with persistent reflux. From a biological perspective,
the progression of Barrett’s oesophagus to adenocarcinoma is
driven by the evolution and proliferation of clones of cells
with accumulated genetic errors, a process referred to as
genomic instability.13 14 In fact, the process of clonal evolution
begins early in Barrett’s oesophagus, before the phenotypic
expression of dysplasia, when metaplastic epithelial cells
acquire mutations that give them a selective proliferative
advantage relative to genetically normal cells. Mutant cells
containing a proliferative advantage then undergo cell
division, which ultimately results in a clone of cells that
contain genetic lesions identical to the original progenitor
cell. In this manner, morphologically non-dysplastic Barrett’s
oesophagus contains progeny clones with accumulated
genetic abnormalities. For instance, a recent study15 16
reported that 85–90% of patients with Barrett’s oesophagus
contain one or more p16 mutations in non-dysplastic
mucosa. In fact, mutations in the p16 gene also correlate
directly with length of columnar mucosa in Barrett’s
oesophagus.15 p53 mutations may also occur in patients with
Barrett’s oesophagus without dysplasia.17 18 These findings
support the hypothesis that Barrett’s oesophagus represents a
neoplastic clonal proliferation rather than a polyclonal
response to injury, as previously believed.12 19 Thus, it is not
surprising that Barrett’s oesophagus cases that are considered
to be negative for dysplasia may show a level of atypia
beyond the limits that pathologists would normally accept as
part of a tissue repair reaction. In general, non-dysplastic
epithelium in Barrett’s oesophagus exhibits cytological
features characteristic of regeneration coupled with preservation of crypt architecture (fig 1). However, a considerable
degree of atypia may be present in markedly reactive
epithelium. For instance, some degree of crypt budding,
branching, atrophy, crowding, distortion or even cystic
change may be present, especially adjacent to or underneath
areas of ulceration. In addition, nuclear stratification is often
present, particularly at the bases of crypts, but occasionally at
the level of the surface epithelium as well, although usually
to a lesser degree. Cytologically, regenerating cells contain
nuclei with smooth membranes, normal nuclear/cytoplasmic
(N/C) ratio, and a variable number of normal mitoses, but
may also show prominent nucleoli, although without notable
enlargement. In general, nuclear pleomorphism, loss of cell
polarity and markedly raised N/C ratio are features of
dysplasia and not of regenerating epithelium. However,
newly formed epithelium covering a freshly ulcerated surface
may show cells with increased N/C ratio, hyperchromaticity
and slight loss of polarity and pleomorphism. In this
instance, tufting of surface cells is often present, which helps
declare the benign nature of the epithelium. Nevertheless, in
contrast with dysplasia, goblet cells, both normal and
dystrophic, are quite common. Cytoplasmic mucin may be
depleted, particularly in areas of inflammation, but even in
these circumstances the crypt cells usually show a progressive
increase in content of mucin in epithelium close to, or at, the
luminal surface. This feature, the preservation of the N/C
ratio and a decrease in the degree of nuclear stratification in
the upper levels of the crypts and in the surface epithelium
represent the hallmark features of surface ‘‘maturation’’,
which is the most characteristic feature of non-dysplastic
epithelium in Barrett’s oesophagus.
In general, nuclear and cytoplasmic changes, and stratification, are more prominent in ulcerated or actively inflamed
mucosa. However, in these instances, and in contrast with
dysplasia, the degree of atypia related to regenerative changes
usually dissipates gradually in areas of mucosa more distant
from the inflammatory infiltrate and represents a helpful
feature in distinguishing it from dysplasia.
Positive for dysplasia, low and high grade
Overall, there are two general histological types of dysplasia
in Barrett’s oesophagus, termed ‘‘adenoma’’ and ‘‘nonadenoma-like’’ because of the resemblance, or lack thereof,
of the cytological features of the dysplastic cells to sporadic
colonic adenomas. However, non-conventional or unusual
forms of dysplasia have been recently recognised in both
Barrett’s oesophagus and inflammatory bowel disease.20 22
Some of these are discussed later. ‘‘Adenomatous’’ LGD,
which is the most common type of dysplasia in Barrett’s
oesophagus, shows crypts with relatively preserved architecture or perhaps only minimal distortion, and stratified
atypical pencil-shaped nuclei limited, for the most part, to
the basal portion of the cell cytoplasm (fig 2). The nuclei in
LGD are typically elongated, crowded and hyperchromatic;
they show an irregular contour and a dense chromatin
pattern either with or without multiple, small inconspicuous
nucleoli. Dysplastic cells are mucin depleted and show a
decrease in the number of goblet cells. Other features include
increased mitoses, both typical and atypical, preservation (or
only slight loss) of cell polarity, increased N/C ratio,

particularly in the bases of the crypts, and lack of surface
maturation, which is a characteristic feature of dysplasia in
general. Most notably, dysplastic epithelium often shows an
abrupt transition to non-dysplastic epithelium, which is a
helpful feature in distinguishing dysplasia from regenerating
epithelium.
With progression to high-grade dysplasia (HGD), the
degree of cytological and architectural complexity becomes
more advanced (table 2, fig 3). In fact, a diagnosis of HGD
may be established if either of these types of abnormalities is
sufficiently prominent, in the absence of the other.4 18 Typical
architectural abnormalities include crypt budding, branching,
marked crowding (evident by a noticeable decrease in the
amount of lamina propria between dysplastic crypts) or a
villiform configuration of the surface epithelium. Crypts
often have an irregular configuration and may show
intraluminal papillae or bridges. However, prominent intraluminal bridges, imparting a cribriform pattern to the glands,
should raise the possibility of intramucosal adenocarcinoma.
Cytologically, in contrast with LGD, HGD shows cells with
marked nuclear pleomorphism and irregularity of contour,
increased N/C ratio, loss of cell polarity and a higher number
of atypical mitoses, particularly in the upper levels of the
crypts and even in the surface epithelium. Full-thickness
nuclear stratification, both in the crypt and surface epithelium, is a characteristic feature of HGD. Nucleoli, when
present, may be large in size and irregular in contour. Similar
to LGD, mucin depletion is prominent and goblet cells, both
typical and dystrophic, are markedly decreased in number or
completely absent. In summary, the important features
helpful in distinguishing LGD from HGD include fullthickness nuclear stratification, loss of cell polarity, particularly at higher levels of the crypts and surface epithelium,

atypical mitoses or considerable architectural distortion in
the HGD, as outlined earlier.
With further neoplastic progression, cells may breach the
basement membrane and invade the lamina propria or
muscularis mucosa, features indicative of intramucosal
adenocarcinoma (fig 4). In some institutes, patients with
intramucosal adenocarcinoma are treated more aggressively
(oesophageal resection) than those with HGD (aggressive
surveillance and endoscopic mucosal ablation),7 23 25 and
thus, distinction between these types of neoplastic lesions
may be clinically important. However, in other institutes,
patients with HGD or intramucosal adenocarcinoma are
managed similarly.26 27 Therefore, it is important to have a
clear understanding of the particular treatment regimens
used at your institute before engaging in a laborious mental
exercise sometimes associated with this differential diagnosis.
Non-adenomatous dysplasia is rare and is a rather poorly
characterised entity with regard to its biological and
pathological characteristics and natural history. However,
most authors consider non-adenomatous dysplasia to be a
form of HGD for the purpose of patient management. Nonadenomatous dysplasia is characterised by crypts that show a
prominent back-to-back gland pattern and contain cells that
are more epithelioid or cuboidal-shaped, with a high N/C
ratio, round or oval highly irregular-shaped nuclei, an open
chromatin pattern and prominent nucleoli (fig 5). In fact, the
crypts may show little or no intervening lamina propria,
which often raises the possibility of intramucosal adenocarcinoma.
Problematic areas of Barrett’s oesophagus-associated
dysplasia interpretation
Regeneration versus low-grade dysplasia
(‘‘indefinite for dysplasia’’)
Although early studies suggested that patients with LGD did
not show a substantially higher rate of progression to
adenocarcinoma than patients with biopsies considered to
be negative or indefinite for dysplasia, recent data suggest
otherwise.7 Unfortunately, given the subtle gradation of
changes that occur in the progression of dysplasia in
Barrett’s oesophagus and the wide range of morphological
patterns of atypia related to regeneration and repair, there is
a significant degree of intraobserver and interobserver
variability in the diagnosis of dysplasia, particularly regarding
cases at the lower end of the spectrum (ie, separating
regeneration from dysplasia), even among experienced
gastrointestinal pathologists.4 6 The highest level of variability
occurs in the differential of marked regenerative changes
versus LGD, often necessitating an interim diagnosis of
indefinite for dysplasia. For instance, in the original study by
Reid et al,

Figure 3 (A) In contrast with low-grade dysplasia (LGD), high-grade
dysplasia (HGD) shows crowded crypts with more severe nuclear
stratification. The nuclei reach the luminal surface in the deeper portions
of the crypts. In addition, there is mild architectural distortion. On highpower view (B), the nuclei have a slightly more open chromatin pattern
with prominent, sometimes multiple, nucleoli and a more marked loss of
cell polarity. The nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of HGD is markedly
increased compared with LGD.

of dysplasia in Barrett’s oesophagus among eight expert
gastrointestinal pathologists, there was only 60% agreement
in distinguishing negative from indefinite and LGD cases. In
fact, in a reproducibility study by Montgomery et al,
5 only
slightly better agreement was noted among expert gastrointestinal pathologists in separating these categories of
dysplasia. These authors also noted a high level of diagnostic
difficulty in diagnosing lesions at the lower end of the
dysplasia spectrum. For instance, k values of 0.32 and 0.15,
indicating only ‘‘fair’’ and ‘‘slight’’ agreement, were obtained
for detection of LGD and indefinite for dysplasia, respectively.
In my experience, the indefinite for dysplasia category is
used most often in one or more of the following three
situations:
N technical issues;
N atypia related to inflammation and ulceration; and
N dysplasia-like changes present only in the bases of the
crypts, with evidence of surface maturation.
Mucosal biopsy specimens that are sectioned in a
tangential manner, possess marked cautery artefact or lack
surface epithelium are often difficult to evaluate definitively
for dysplasia (fig 6). In a study by Baak et al28 that evaluated
Barrett’s oesophagus-associated biopsy specimens by morphometric analysis, 64 of 71 cases of LGD and 11 of 23 cases
of HGD initially diagnosed by general pathologists were
downgraded by experts on re-evaluation of the biopsy
specimens. In fact, 46% of the experts’ ‘‘downgrades’’ were
thought to be due to technically inadequate tissue sections.
Tangentially sectioned biopsy specimens that lack welloriented crypts and surface epithelium may be difficult to
evaluate for the presence or absence of surface maturation,
which is an important feature to consider in the regeneration
versus dysplasia differential diagnosis.
Regenerating epithelium, particularly in the setting of
active inflammation or ulceration, may, on occasion, show a
considerable degree of cytological atypia similar to that in
LGD or even HGD. In architecturally normal biopsy specimens with inflammation, the lack of an abrupt transition
from atypical to non-atypical epithelium and the presence of
surface maturation, combined with a lack of nuclear
pleomorphism, atypical mitoses and loss of cell polarity, are
helpful features in distinguishing regenerative changes from
dysplasia. This constellation of features was also considered
helpful in the interobserver study by Montgomery et al.
5 In
that study, the investigators thought that lesions considered
to be ‘‘indefinite’’ showed inflammation, retention of their
crypt architecture, a normal ratio of glands to lamina propria,
obvious signs of surface maturation, and had nuclear
changes that ‘‘approached but did not quite reach’’ those of
LGD. In that scenario, it is reasonable to establish a diagnosis
of indefinite for dysplasia, and to recommend that further
biopsy specimens be obtained after aggressive reflux treatment has been instituted and the inflammation has subsided.
As noted above, inflammation-induced ‘‘atypical’’ regenerative changes are most pronounced at the neosquamocolumnar junction, a region that shows a high level of cell turnover,
injury and repair. Therefore, the diagnostic ‘‘threshold’’ for
dysplasia should be raised when evaluating mucosal biopsy
specimens from this anatomical region.
It is commonly believed among many gastrointestinal
pathologists that dysplasia, regardless of the grade, is characterised by total crypt and surface epithelium involvement
without surface maturation.245 This supposition is based on the
commonly held belief that preneoplastic lesions, by definition,
show a loss of differentiation capability. However, the author of
this review has recently reported that mucosal biopsy specimens
from patients with longstanding Barrett’s oesophagus may,
rarely, show dysplastic features that are limited to the crypt
bases, without involvement of the upper portions of the crypt or
surface epithelium20 (fig 7). In our study, 15 patients with
Barrett’s oesophagus who had ‘‘basal crypt dysplasia-like atypia
(BCDA) with surface maturation’’ were evaluated for a variety
of pathological, immunohistochemical and molecular features.
On the basis of the finding of a considerably increased
association with conventional dysplasia or adenocarcinoma,

an increased prevalence rate of p53 positivity and a markedly
increased rate of 9pLOH, 17pLOH and aneuploidy in patients
with BCDA compared with controls, we concluded that this
subtype of ‘‘atypical’’ changes probably represents true
dysplasia despite the presence of surface maturation in these
lesions. In fact, in the interobserver study by Montgomery
et al5 quoted earlier, atypical lesions of this kind posed the
greatest degree of diagnostic difficulty, and the widest range
of diagnoses, among the participating pathologists. Of course,
the presence of active inflammation in association with
BCDA should prompt the pathologist to use restraint, and in
this situation, it is probably wise to establish a diagnosis of
indefinite for dysplasia until further biopsy specimens can be
obtained after the inflammation has subsided. Figure 8 outlines
a diagnostic algorithm that may be helpful when evaluating
diagnostically difficult lesions in Barrett’s oesophagus.
Low-grade dysplasia versus high-grade dysplasia
As discussed earlier, HGD is distinguished from LGD based
primarily on the basis of the degree of architectural and
cytological aberrations. Unfortunately, as dysplasia progresses to cancer on a continuous scale, there are no welldefined ‘‘cut off points’’ that help separate these two types of
lesions. In general, the overall grade of dysplasia is
determined by the features of the most atypical portion of
epithelium. However, the precise number of ‘‘high-grade’’
dysplastic crypts that are necessary to upgrade a biopsy
specimen from LGD to HGD has never been investigated and
varies among expert gastrointestinal pathologists. In the
original classification of dysplasia in the gastrointestinal tract
proposed by the IBD dysplasia morphology study group in
1983, the authors recommended, anecdotally, that ‘‘designation of a biopsy as high grade based solely on the presence of
HGD in one or two crypts is probably not justified’’.2 In the
interobserver variability study by Reid et al,
4 which included
many of the same authors, there was considerable disagreement regarding the minimum area required to establish a
diagnosis of HGD. This issue was not discussed in the recent
study on Barrett’s oesophagus by Montgomery et al.
5
Nevertheless, we have recent evidence to suggest that
measurement of the extent of dysplasia is a highly important
method of evaluating cancer risk in patients with Barrett’s
oesophagus.29 30 For instance, in a recent study by Srivastava
et al29 published in abstract form in 2005, the extent of
dysplasia, regardless of the grade, was a strong risk factor for
the development of invasive cancer in a 52-month follow-up
study of 69 high-risk patients with Barrett’s oesophagus, 28
of whom eventually developed adenocarcinoma. In that
study, the mean number of crypts with LGD in patients
who ultimately developed adenocarcinoma was 5.8 compared
with only 2.6 in patients without cancer. These results are
supported by a study by Buttar et al30 in which the extent of
HGD in Barrett’s oesophagus was shown to be correlated
with the risk of developing adenocarcinoma. In their study,
cancer-free survival rates were considerably higher in
patients with ‘‘focal HGD’’ than in those with ‘‘diffuse
HGD’’. However, a study by Dar et al,
31 in which the extent of
HGD was evaluated on the basis of the number of levels of
the oesophagus that contained mucosa with HGD, did not
corroborate the results of Buttar et al.
30 In my practice, I
always try to provide an objective measurement of the extent
of LGD and HGD in all biopsy specimens with dysplasia.
Although anecdotal, clinicians find this information useful
when planning treatment strategies for patients with
Barrett’s oesophagus. For instance, a biopsy sign out
indicating that there is ‘‘LGD and focal HGD’’ (implying that
HGD includes only a small proportion of the number of
dysplastic crypts) provides additional objective information
and may prompt more aggressive surveillance or alternative
protocol treatments rather than oesophagectomy, which is
still the most commonly applied method of treatment for
patients having Barrett’s oesophagus with HGD.
High-grade dysplasia versus intramucosal
adenocarcinoma
As mentioned earlier, the distinction between HGD and
intramucosal adenocarcinoma may be difficult and is often
clinically relevant (fig 9). Lymphatic vessels are present in the

polarity and a focal gland in gland pattern. Mitoses are readily identified. The superficial portion of the crypts, however, shows evidence of surface
maturation characterised by a decrease in the size of nuclei, less stratification and progressive acquisition of mucin in the cytoplasm of cells on the
surface BO.

lamina propria of the oesophageal mucosa. As a result, there
is a 5–8% risk of lymph node metastases in patients with
tumours limited to the mucosal compartment, which is a
major reason why oesophagectomy is widely regarded as the
best method of treatment for patients having Barrett’s
oesophagus with intramucosal adenocarcinoma.23 26 32 In
contrast, some studies suggest that a vigorous surveillance
biopsy protocol is a practical and safe alternative to
oesophagectomy for patients with HGD.24 25 In a study by
Ormsby et al,
23 75 oesophagectomy specimens were reviewed
by two gastrointestinal pathologists and one general surgical
pathologist and classified as either, intramucosal or submucosal adenocarcinoma.23 The level of interobserver agreement for HGD versus intramucosal adenocarcinoma was only
fair (k = 0.42) and, most importantly, did not improve greatly
after establishment of uniform histological criteria (k = 0.5).
In my experience, there is a tendency for general pathologists
to overdiagnose intramucosal adenocarcinoma. Often, this is
because prominent architectural aberrations, such as crypt
budding and branching, are interpreted as evidence of
invasion, rather than simply complex in situ disease. My
personal practice is to diagnose intramucosal carcinoma only
when one or more of the following architectural features are
present:
N single cells or small clusters of tightly compact back-toback glands are present in the lamina propria
N there is a complex gland-in-gland or ‘‘cribriforming’’
pattern present, with evidence of an expansion of the
lamina propria and distortion of the surrounding crypts
N neoplastic cells or glands are present that show a back-toback or highly irregular architectural glandular arrangement,
which cannot be explained by the presence of pre-existing
Barrett’s glands, as previously defined by Ormsby et al.
23
The presence of necrosis or desmoplasia is evidence in
favour of adenocarcinoma as well, although these features
are rarely present in carcinomas limited to the mucosa, and,
may not be present in submucosal invasive carcinomas
either.23 When in doubt, I advocate using the term ‘‘HGD
with foci suspicious, but not diagnostic, of intramucosal
adenocarcinoma’’ (which corresponds to category 4.3 in the
Vienna Classification System) and recommend that repeat
biopsies should be performed if this distinction is clinically
relevant.
Intramucosal versus submucosal adenocarcinoma
On occasion, dysplastic glands may be located in the
muscularis mucosa (fig 10). In this situation, the differentiation of ‘‘misplaced’’ non-invasive glands from truly invasive
glands may be difficult. We must be cautious not to
overinterpret these findings, particularly if the glands contain
cytologically bland or only LGD changes, and the crypts are

Figure 9 High-grade dysplasia in Barrett’s oesophagus with a focal
area highly suggestive of intramucosal adenocarcinoma. In the centre of
the field is a proliferation of small glands in a back-to-back
configuration, with little intervening lamina propria, which is difficult to
explain on the basis of involvement of pre-existing crypts. There is a
suggestion of isolated single cells in the lamina propria as well.

not particularly distorted in shape. One reason for exercising
caution is that patients with Barrett’s oesophagus often
develop a new (superficial), more luminally situated, layer of
muscularis mucosa that directly underlies the region of
metaplastic columnar epithelium.33 Unfortunately, the nature
of the stroma that lies between the original (deep) and the
new muscularis mucosa has never been investigated. As a
result, it also remains unclear whether glands that penetrate
through the new muscularis mucosa should be considered to
be intramucosal or submucosal carcinomas. However, in a
recent study of 120 patients with early adenocarcinoma (13
with HGD and 107 with stage T1 adenocarcinoma) of the
oesophagus or gastroesophageal junction treated by oesophagectomy in which outcome was stratified according to the
depth of tumour invasion, patients with tumours invading
the ‘‘new’’ muscularis mucosa had a similar outcome as those
with invasion into the original (deep) muscularis.34 Only 1%
of these patients had lymph node metastasis compared with
44% of the patients with tumours that penetrated into the
mid or deep portion of the original (‘‘true’’) submucosa.
These data suggest that the stromal space located between
the original and new muscularis mucosa represents ‘‘lamina
propria’’ and tumours that infiltrate this region should
probably be considered intramucosal, from a biological point
of view. Nevertheless, further studies are needed in this
regard.
Dysplasia and macroscopically visible lesions
Several studies have shown that the natural history and risk
of malignancy in Barrett’s oesophagus are highly dependent
on the macroscopic features of the dysplastic lesions.35 39 As a
result, the diagnosis and grading of dysplasia in Barrett’s
oesophagus should be carried out in conjunction with
knowledge of the endoscopic features of the patient.
Common macroscopic lesions include ulcers, nodules
(defined as an area of subtle mucosal elevation measuring
,l cm in diameter) and strictures. In a study by Hillman
et al,
36 patients with one or more macroscopic lesions were
more likely to develop HGD and cancer than those without
endoscopically identifiable lesions. In a recent study by
Buttar et al,
30 15 of 25 (60%) patients with dysplastic nodules
had cancer compared with only 17 of 25 (23%) patients
without nodules. In fact, the risk of cancer was increased by a
factor of 4 in patients who had visible nodules at endoscopy.
In a study by Montgomery et al,
35 a higher proportion of
patients with Barrett’s oesophagus with ulcers had HGD or
adenocarcinoma than patients without ulcers, and the
presence of an ulcer with HGD increased the likelihood of
detecting carcinoma in a subsequent resection specimen.
Mucosal nodularity offers the opportunity for endoscopic
mucosal resection and the capability of assessing more tissue
than endoscopic biopsy samples.
Rarely, dysplasia in Barrett’s oesophagus may grow as a
well-defined polyp with an adenoma-like appearance.37 38
However, owing to the previously reported strong association
of these lesions with HGD and adenocarcinoma, and with
dysplasia in the surrounding flat dysplasia, these lesions
should be considered ‘‘polypoid dysplasia’’ rather than
‘‘adenoma’’.37 The term adenoma imparts a ‘‘benign’’
connotation to the lesion and may lead to undertreatment
by polypectomy rather than oesophagectomy.
Adjunctive markers in the diagnosis of dysplasia
Many studies have evaluated the potential utility of
immunohistochemical or molecular markers as adjunctive
methods in detecting dysplasia and in distinguishing reactive
from dysplastic epithelium in Barrett’s oesophagus.7 11 16 28 40–49
Most of the markers investigated have been linked, in some
capacity, to the pathogenesis of cancer and include those
associated with control of cell proliferation, intercellular
adhesion and tumour suppression, among others. Of the vast
array of markers evaluated, detection of DNA content
abnormalities by flow cytometry (aneuploidy or elevated 4N
fraction) and evaluation of mutations or loss of homozygosity
of the pl6 and p53 genes are the most promising potential
methods to help identify high-risk patients.7 50 Unfortunately,
none of these methods has been shown to be particularly
useful in differentiating non-dysplastic from dysplastic
epithelium in routine pathology practice. Other methods,
such as computerised quantitative pathology or measurement
of proliferation indices, have also been shown to decrease
diagnostic variability in this regard, but these methods have
not been standardised.28 41 Evaluation of p53 by immunostaining remains the most controversial.7 43 51
Proponents of p53 immunostaining as an adjunctive
diagnostic method state that the p53 gene is only rarely
mutated in non-dysplastic epithelium and that the frequency
of mutations has been shown to increase dramatically in
HGD and adenocarcinoma. Unfortunately, p53 overexpression by immunohistochemistry can be detected in up
to 10% of cases considered to be morphologically negative for
dysplasia.43 51 53 In addition, several studies have shown a
high rate of false positive staining (up to 56%) in the absence
of p53 mutations, and a high frequency of false negative
staining as well (up to 30%).43 51 Non-specific binding of p53
to non-p53 mutation-related antigens may also lead to false
positive results. Furthermore, p53 results may vary substantially depending on the specific type of antibody used. In fact,
certain types of mutations result in the production of a p53
protein that does not bind to some antibodies directed
against the wild-type protein.43 Finally, no known antibody,
or combination of antibodies, can detect all p53 mutations.
For these reasons, I do not advocate the use of p53
immunostaining in routine practice to help differentiate
regenerating from dysplastic epithelium in diagnostically
difficult cases.
However, recently, immunostaining for a-methylacyl-CoAracemase (AMACR), an antibody often used in the assessment of diagnostically difficult atypical and potentially
neoplastic lesions of the prostate, has been shown to have a
high degree of specificity for detection of dysplasia
in Barrett’s oesophagus and inflammatory bowel disease.45
In a recent study by Dorer et al,
45 AMACR was not detected in
any of 36 cases with Barrett’s oesophagus without dysplasia
(0%) but was positive in 38%, 81% and 72% of cases of LGD,
HGD and adenocarcinoma, respectively. In that study, three

of the mucosa show an attenuated epithelium. However, this is not
uncommon in BO and should not be interpreted as evidence of
adenocarcinoma.

‘‘indefinite’’ cases were also positive, but in the one case in
which follow-up information was available, adenocarcinoma
was detected on follow-up. Thus, AMACR immunostaining
may represent a potentially useful adjunctive method in
differentiating reactive from dysplastic epithelium in
Barrett’s oesophagus, but, in my opinion, requires validation
by other investigators before use in routine clinical practice.
SUMMARY
Despite the problems associated with detection and reproducibility, morphological evaluation of dysplasia in mucosal
biopsy specimens still remains the mainstay of surveillance
and treatment of Barrett’s oesophagus worldwide. Careful
attention to the cytological and architectural features of
dysplasia, as outlined earlier, and recognition of the extreme
degrees of regeneration that may occur in this condition, can
help minimise observer error. Use of consultants with
particular expertise in gastrointestinal pathology is highly
recommended before institution of definitive management in
patients with Barrett’s oesophagus with ‘‘atypical’’ biopsy
specimens. Fortunately, pathologists have a reasonably good
track record at detecting clinically relevant dysplasia, such as
HGD and intramucosal adenocarcinoma, lesions that usually
necessitate aggressive methods of intervention such as
endoscopic mucosal resection, mucosal ablation or surgical
resection. Adjunctive diagnostic methods, such as AMACR
immunostaining, are promising, but further studies are
needed to find either non-morphology-based or morphology-based reproducible methods that can reliably help
stratify cancer risk in patients with Barrett’s oesophagus.

Clinical Evidence—Call for contributors
Clinical Evidence is a regularly updated evidence-based journal available worldwide both as
a paper version and on the internet. Clinical Evidence needs to recruit a number of new
contributors. Contributors are healthcare professionals or epidemiologists with experience in
evidence-based medicine and the ability to write in a concise and structured way.
Areas for which we are currently seeking contributors:
N Pregnancy and childbirth
N Endocrine disorders
N Palliative care
N Tropical diseases
We are also looking for contributors for existing topics. For full details on what these topics
are please visit www.clinicalevidence.com/ceweb/contribute/index.jsp
However, we are always looking for others, so do not let this list discourage you.
Being a contributor involves:
N Selecting from a validated, screened search (performed by in-house Information
Specialists) epidemiologically sound studies for inclusion.
N Documenting your decisions about which studies to include on an inclusion and exclusion
form, which we keep on file.
N Writing the text to a highly structured template (about 1500-3000 words), using evidence
from the final studies chosen, within 8-10 weeks of receiving the literature search.
N Working with Clinical Evidence editors to ensure that the final text meets epidemiological
and style standards.
N Updating the text every 12 months using any new, sound evidence that becomes available.
The Clinical Evidence in-house team will conduct the searches for contributors; your task is
simply to filter out high quality studies and incorporate them in the existing text.
If you would like to become a contributor for Clinical Evidence or require more information
about what this involves please send your contact details and a copy of your CV, clearly
stating the clinical area you are interested in, to CECommissioning@bmjgroup.com.
Call for peer reviewers
Clinical Evidence also needs to recruit a number of new peer reviewers specifically with an
interest in the clinical areas stated above, and also others related to general practice. Peer
reviewers are healthcare professionals or epidemiologists with experience in evidence-based
medicine. As a peer reviewer you would be asked for your views on the clinical relevance,
validity, and accessibility of specific topics within the journal, and their usefulness to the
intended audience (international generalists and healthcare professionals, possibly with
limited statistical knowledge). Topics are usually 1500-3000 words in length and we would
