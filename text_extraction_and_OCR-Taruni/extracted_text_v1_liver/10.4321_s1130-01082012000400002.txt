ABSTRACT
Chronic liver diseases (CLD) alter the kinetics of drugs. Despite
dosage adjustment is based on Child-Pugh scores, there are no available recommendations and/or algorithms of reference to facilitate
dosage regimens. 
A literature review about dose adjustment of the drugs from
the hospital guide –which are included in the list of the WHO
recommended drugs to be avoided or used with caution in patients
with liver disease– was carried out. The therapeutic novelties from
the last few years were also included. In order to do so, the summary of product characteristics (SPC), the database DrugDexMicromedex, the WHO recommendations and the review articles
from the last 10 years in Medline were reviewed. Moreover, the
kinetic parameters of each drug were calculated with the aim of
establishing a theoretical recommendation based on the proposal
of Delcò and Huet.
Recommendations for 186 drugs are presented according to the
SPC (49.5%), DrugDex-Micromedex (26.3%) and WHO (18.8%)
indications; six recommendations were based on specific publications;
the theoretical recommendation based on pharmacokinetic parameters was proposed in four drugs.
The final recommendations for clinical management were: dosage
modification (26.9%), hepatic/analytical monitoring of the patient
(8.6%), contraindication (18.8%), use with caution (19.3%) and no
adjustment required (26.3%).
In this review, specific recommendations for the practical management of patients with chronic liver disease are presented. It has
been elaborated through a synthesis of the published bibliography
and completed by following a theoretical methodology.

INTRODUCTION
The liver plays a fundamental role in the metabolism of
most drugs because hepatic and biliary excretion processes
determine the rate of their elimination from the body, while
bioavailability is affected by first-pass mechanisms. 
Alterations affecting the kinetics of drugs in chronic liver
disease (CLD) are mainly due to three mechanisms: reduction of portal blood flow which affects the pre-systemic
elimination of high extraction drugs; decreased synthesis
of transport proteins, mainly albumin and alpha-glycoprotein, which affect the bioavailability of drugs highly bound
to plasma proteins; reduced drug-metabolizing hepatic
enzymes, which affects the amount of plasma active
metabolite, thus, the effectiveness and toxicity (1). 
Chronic liver disease is assessed through Child-Pugh
score system which is based on five variables: the presence
of ascites and encephalopathy, plasma concentrations of
bilirubin and albumin and prothrombin time. The ChildPugh score indicates the level of chronic hepatic damage:
score 5-6 is class A (mild); 7-9 corresponds to class B (moderate); and 10-15 is class C (severe) (2,3).
Another classification scheme such as MELD (Model
for End stage Liver Disease) is based on serum bilirubin
concentration, serum creatinine, the international normalized ratio (INR) of prothrombin time, and the underlying
cause of liver disease (4). The MELD score was designed
to predict 3-month mortality among patients on a livertransplant waiting list and has been adopted to use for
allocating priorities in patients awaiting liver transplantation (5). However, unlike in renal patients, where estimates of glomerular filtration rate (creatinine clearance,

inulin clearance) correlate with kinetic parameters of drug
elimination such as renal clearance, these classification
schemes lack the sensitivity to quantitate the specific ability of the liver to metabolize individual drugs. That is why
it is not a frequently used classification scheme for pharmacological adjustment. 
The recommendations for drug dosage adjustment in
patients with CLD are based on Child-Pugh scores. Since
2003 and 2005 respectively, the regulating agencies Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) require the performance of kinetic
studies previous to the authorization of new drugs in
patients with CLD in order to provide future dose adjustment recommendations (6,7). This information reflected
in the summary of product characteristics (SPC) is highly
useful. However, a great amount of drugs lack of this specific information because patients recruited in clinical trials show a good hepatic function (Child-Pug class A) and
do not have an advanced liver dysfunction (Child-Pugh
class C).
The complexity of hepatic metabolism has limited the
development of tools allowing predictions of drug behavior in patients with chronic liver disease. Unlike in renal
insufficiency, there are no guidelines and algorithms of
reference to facilitate drug dosage in these patients. In
this context, there is a growing need to check and expand
the available information in the SPC. The review of recommendations from other sources and the application of
calculation procedures based on the kinetic parameters of
the drug are needed to establish practical dose recommendations in CLD for the frequently used drugs in the care
environment. 
The aim of this article is to provide dose adjustment
recommendations for the most commonly used drugs in
the hospital in patients with chronic liver disease. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Drugs were selected from the list of medicines WHO
recommends to avoid or to use with caution in patients with
liver disease (8), selecting those included in the hospital
Pharmacotherapeutic Guide (PG). The therapeutic novelties
from over the last few years were also included.
A literature review about dosage recommendations in
chronic liver disease was carried out for the selected drugs
from the following sources: a) SPC; b) DrugDex Micromedex
(9); c) WHO recommendations (8); and d) review articles
published in the last 10 years in the Medline database with
the following search strategy: “Hepatic”[Ti] OR “liver”[Ti])
AND (“Dose-Response Relationship, Drug”[Mesh]) AND
(Review[ptyp] AND (English[lang] OR Spanish[lang]) AND
“2001/02/27”[PDat]: “2011/02/24”[PDat]). The following
search engines were used: “Scholar-google” and “Alquimia”
(10) with the aim of finding bulletins published by centers of
reference which include drug dosage recommendations in
chronic liver disease. 
The final dosage recommendations have been based
on the SPC information and on the rest of the bibliography defined in the search strategy. In case they were 
not coincident, the most restrictive proposal was
taken. 
When no information was found, the adjustment recommendations were given according to the process
defined by Delcò et al. (1), based on the method established by Huet et al. (11) and Krähenbühl et al. (12). This
method classifies each drug according to three parameters:
hepatic extraction ratio (EH) –classified in 3 categories
(high ≥ 60%, intermediate 30-60% and low ≤ 30%),
bioavailability (F) and plasma protein binding (PB) (Table
I). For the drugs with no EH available information, EH was
calculated using the formula defined by Westphal et al.
(11): [EH = (Q0 x CLsyst)/QH]. Q0 values (extra renal drug
moiety) and CLsyst (systemic or total clearance) were
obtained from the literature, assuming a hepatic blood
flow (QH) of 1.5 L/min.
In order to have supplementary information to the bibliography, the following parameters were registered for
all drugs: EH, bioavailability, plasma protein binding and
the corresponding category according to the Huet classification (11).
RESULTS
The information of 191 drugs was reviewed: 56 of
oncology therapy, 84 anti-infective agents [antibiotics

(35), anti-tuberculosis drugs (5), antifungal (15) and antiretroviral agents (29)], 13 of cardiovascular therapy and
38 of other pharmacological groups.
The final recommendation was established for 186
reviewed drugs and was defined according to the SPC in
92 (49.5%), 49 in DrugDex Micromedex (26.3%) and 35
in WHO (18.8%); the recommendations of 6 drugs (3.2%)
were based on the publications of Azanza et al. (14), for
the group of antimicrobials. In four drugs (2.2%) (dacarbazine, leuprorelin, maraviroc and zidovudine) no information in the previously mentioned databases was found
nor in further bibliography searches. That is why a theoretical adjustment recommendation based on the proposal defined by Delcò et al. (1) and Huet et al. (11) was
given. In five drugs (buserelin, dactinomycin, enfuvirtide,
megestrol and trastuzumab) no information was found
about dosage adjustment due to lack of data. 
Depending on the type of recommendation the following was obtained: 48 drugs (25.8%) needed quantitative
adjustment; 88 drugs (47.3%) had to follow qualitative
recommendations divided into: 37 caution of use, 16
monitoring the patient and 35 contraindication; and 50
drugs (26.9%) did not require dosage adjustment, being
72% of them of low EH (< 0.3).
Regarding the reviewed drugs, the established classification by Huet et al. (11) was the following respectively:
19 (10.2%) class 1; 28 (15.1%) class 2; 77 (41.4%) class
3 and 62 (33.3%) class 4.
From the 191 reviewed drugs, EH was calculated with
the Westphal et al. formula (13) in 103 drugs (53.9%); in
66 drugs (34.6%) it was not obtained due to lack of data;
in 22 drugs (11.5%) EH wasobtained through the bibliography. 
Some other registered parameters to justify dosage
adjustment were: PB ≥ 90% in 66 drugs (34.6%), < 90%
in 102 drugs (53.4%) and no data was obtained in 23
drugs (12.0%). The hepatic/biliary metabolism predominance with a score of Q0 > 0.4 was found in 65 drugs
(34.0%), it was less than 0.4 in 35 drugs (18.3%) and it
could not be obtained in 91 (47.6%), which indicates that
most of the drugs in which Q0 was obtained are highly
metabolized and/or are excreted through bile. 
The dosage adjustment recommendation is shown in
table II, it indicates the final recommendation in drugs
requiring adjustment in chronic liver disease, drugs in
which hepatic or analytic monitorization is recommended,
contraindicated drugs in chronic liver disease, drugs used
with caution and drugs not requiring adjustment in chronic liver disease. The category Huet and Krähenbühl and
the EH of every drug is also found in table II. 
DISCUSSION
In this review, a dosage adjustment for 186 frequently
used drugs in hospitals in patients with chronic liver disease is proposed. 
There is not an established method available to assess
hepatic failure which correlates with the hepatic clearance
of drugs. Besides, the semiquantitive scale of Child-Pugh
is not precise and it does not always quantify the specific
capacity of the liver to metabolize different drugs. Drug
adjustment to the hepatic function of the patient by using
the Child-Pugh score has limitations because it was initially designed to stratify the risk of anastomosis or portocaval shunt in cirrhotic patients. However, it has been
demonstrated that the Child-Pugh score shows also some
relation with survival and with the development of complications in cirrhosis. The Child-Pugh score requires
quantification of subjective variables such as ascites and
encephalopathy, which vary among different observers
and can be modified by medical interventions such as the
lactulose and/or diuretics prescription in encephalopathy
and ascites.
The Child-Pugh score is mostly used in the review articles which include drug dosage recommendations in
patients with chronic liver disease through the application
of an explicit methodological procedure (8,15-19). The
bulletin written by Shapiro (20) compared the Child-Pugh
scores with the Cockcroft-Gault equation used in the
adjustment for renal insufficiency. In some studies, the
adjustment based on the EH with supplementary information such as plasma protein binding, hepatic cytochrome
metabolism or transaminases among others (1,17,19) is
proposed. However, general recommendations are proposed for most of the drugs.
To define the drugs that have to be adjusted in patients
with chronic liver disease, the main parameter proposed
by different authors is EH. Kim et al. (21) proposes to
establish three categories to adjust drugs depending on
EH in the hepatic first-pass effect, being those of high
extraction the adjusted ones.
The recommendations of the Drug Information Service
(22) propose that in the case of a severe liver dysfunction
(albumin < 30 g/dL, INR > 1.2), drugs with a high EH are
still the ones which should have a higher adjustment
despite it includes the possibility of dose reduction in the
low extraction ones. Accordingly, Shlatter et al. (16) agree
in the dosage recommendations based on EH and/or pharmacological bioavailability, justifying adjustments of initial doses and maintenance.
The established recommendations about the possible
dose adjustment in patients with hepatic insufficiency by
Verbeeck et al. (19) are very similar to the ones by Delcò
et al. (1) and Klotz (23). Both characterize the drugs
depending on the hepatic extraction rate, plasma protein
binding and their hydrophilicity. The difference with the
previous authors is that the latest propose an initial and
maintenance dose adjustment (1,19) of the drugs with a
low level of extraction and a narrow therapeutic range.
Pirmohamed (17) proposes to select those with a wide
therapeutic range to ensure a lower hepatotoxicity. Some
other authors such as Sloss et al. (18) establish the avoidance of use or the increase of administration intervals in

drugs with a low therapeutic margin and high-medium EH
as measures to reduce the dose. Besides monitoring carefully the adverse effects and analyzing the possible pharmacological interactions. Finally, the article published by
Azanza et al. (14) summarizes in tables the adjustments
in the presence of renal insufficiency and/or of hepatic
function failure from the antimicrobials according to the
Child-Pugh score published in the literature. Drugs classified as “use with caution” are also another aspect to evaluate. The use of them should assess the balance of benefit/risk for each case because in all of them the adverse
reactions in the hepatic level have been described, which
could make the pathology worse in these subpopulation
of patients. In the review, the lack of information and clinical studies with many drugs becomes clear. This is
because until recent years, patients with Child-Pugh C
were excluded in the development of new drugs for ethical
reasons. Despite regulating agencies EMA and FDA recommend to study the research drugs in order to predict
their behavior in patients with hepatic insufficiency and
to being able to recommend dose adjustment, according
to a recent survey, the number of drugs with specific

adjustment recommendations based on the hepatic function with Child-Pugh scores is still very limited (24), probably due to hepatic insufficiency as exclusion criteria in
most of the clinical trials. This would explain the lack of
data in many cases in the SPC about dosage adjustment
in moderate-severe hepatic insufficiency.
Moreover, there is a confirmed lack of consistency in
the different consulted sources. This situation is also found
in the general dosage recommendations as well as in the
available kinetic data of drugs, mainly in the EH, as it happens in the adjustment for renal insufficiency (25).
In view of the discrepancies highlighted above, the
more conservative model is followed; despite it has the
risk of an under-dosage, in some cases. Moreover, no
guidelines in case of concomitant renal insufficiency or
hepato-renal syndrome have been developed which could
show one of its own limitations. Despite the existence of
theoretical general recommendations in the medical literature about drug dosage in patients with hepatic insufficiency taking into account the pharmacokinetic parameters of EH, plasma protein binding and bioavailability
(1,15-19,21,22), it has been considered more useful to
individualize the recommendations for each drug and
adjust them to adult patients with liver diseases. We wonder if the recommendations can be applied to all patients
with hepatic disease or if, on the contrary, a limit between
acute, chronic or multiorganic failure hepatic diseases
should be established.
In clinical practice, patients should be carefully analyzed to determine the risks and benefits, taking many
factors into account such as the severity of the disease,
the consequences of not using the drug and the existence
of equivalences or alternatives of different available treatments. When having the chance to choose among many
drugs to treat the same disease, the less hepatotoxic should
be selected through published reviews which would help
to take the right one (26) and with a wide therapeutic
range. In case of hepatic insufficiency, caution to manage
the treatment is imposed as well as an effective followup to determine the intensity and duration of the desirable
and undesirable effects, mainly if repeated or continuous
administrations exist.
In conclusion, nowadays there are significant gaps in
the necessary data for the safety in drug administration
in patients with hepatic function failure. That is why in
this review a contribution to the practical management
of drugs to facilitate dosage recommendations to doctors/caregivers in patients with chronic liver disease is
presented. It has been obtained through a synthesis of the
published bibliography and completed by applying a theoretical methodology.
