Abstract
Definition of the disease: AL amyloidosis results from extra-cellular deposition of fibril-forming monoclonal
immunoglobulin (Ig) light chains (LC) (most commonly of lambda isotype) usually secreted by a small plasma cell
clone. Most patients have evidence of isolated monoclonal gammopathy or smoldering myeloma, and the
occurrence of AL amyloidosis in patients with symptomatic multiple myeloma or other B-cell lymphoproliferative
disorders is unusual. The key event in the development of AL amyloidosis is the change in the secondary or tertiary
structure of an abnormal monoclonal LC, which results in instable conformation. This conformational change is
responsible for abnormal folding of the LC, rich in β leaves, which assemble into monomers that stack together to
form amyloid fibrils.
Epidemiology: AL amyloidosis is the most common type of systemic amyloidois in developed countries with an
estimated incidence of 9 cases/million inhabitant/year. The average age of diagnosed patients is 65 years and less
than 10% of patients are under 50.
Clinical description: The clinical presentation is protean, because of the wide number of tissues or organs that
may be affected. The most common presenting symptoms are asthenia and dyspnoea, which are poorly specific
and may account for delayed diagnosis. Renal manifestations are the most frequent, affecting two thirds of patients
at presentation. They are characterized by heavy proteinuria, with nephrotic syndrome and impaired renal function
in half of the patients. Heart involvement, which is present at diagnosis in more than 50% of patients, leading to
restrictive cardiopathy, is the most serious complication and engages prognosis.
Diagnostic methods: The diagnosis relies on pathological examination of an involved site showing Congo
red-positive amyloid deposits, with typical apple-green birefringence under polarized light, that stain positive with
an anti-LC antibody by immunohistochemistry and/or immunofluorescence. Due to the systemic nature of the
disease, non-invasive biopsies such as abdominal fat aspiration should be considered before taking biopsies from
involved organs, in order to reduce the risk of bleeding complications.
Differential diagnosis: Systemic AL amyloidosis should be distinguished from other diseases related to deposition
of monoclonal LC, and from other forms of systemic amyloidosis. When pathological studies have failed to identify
the nature of amyloid deposits, genetic studies should be performed to diagnose hereditary amyloidosis.

Management: Treatment of AL amyloidosis is based on chemotherapy, aimed at controlling the underlying plasma
clone that produces amyloidogenic LC. The hematological response should be carefully checked by serial
measurements of serum free LC. The association of an alkylating agent with high-dose dexamethasone has proven
to be effective in two thirds of patients and is considered as the current reference treatment. New agents used in
the treatment of multiple myeloma are under investigation and appear to increase hematological response rates.
Symptomatic measures and supportive care is necessary in patients with organ failure. Noticeably, usual treatments
for cardiac failure (i.e. calcium inhibitors, β-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors) are inefficient or
even dangerous in patients with amyloid heart disease, that should be managed using diuretics. Amiodarone and
pace maker implantation should be considered in patients with rhythm or conduction abnormalities. In selected
cases, heart and kidney transplantation may be associated with prolonged patient and graft survival.
Prognosis: Survival in AL amyloidosis depends on the spectrum of organ involvement (amyloid heart disease being
the main prognosis factor), the severity of individual organs involved and haematological response to treatment.

Definition
Amyloidosis belongs to the group of protein conformational diseases and results from the ability of certain
proteins to adopt an unstable tertiary structure leading
to their polymerisation into insoluble amyloid fibrils in
the extra-cellular space of various tissues. Twenty-seven
proteins have been described as amyloidogenic precursors. Immunoglobulinic amyloidosis, also referred to as
AL or “primary” amyloidosis, in which fibrils are made
up of a monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) light chain
(LC), is the most common and the most severe form of
amyloidosis. AL amyloidosis is usually a systemic disease
characterized by multiple organ and tissue involvement.
Less frequently, it manifests as a local disorder, restricted
to a single tissue or organ, related to focal infiltration of
a plasma cell clone secreting amyloid-forming LC, that
do not progress to multi-system involvement. Therefore,
the disease spectrum of AL amyloidosis is broad, ranging
from mild symptoms in some patients with localized AL
amyloidosis that can be managed with local therapy, to
life threatening disorders in those with multiple organ
deposition, which require prompt diagnosis and aggressive therapy to preserve survival [1].
Epidemiology of AL amyloidosis
AL amyloidosis is considered to be 5 to 10 times less
frequent than multiple myeloma, but it represents the
most common type of systemic amyloidosis in western
countries, with an incidence estimated to be around 9
cases per million inhabitants per year, whereas the frequency of AA amyloidosis has considerably decreased
thanks to better treatment of chronic infectious and inflammatory diseases [2]. AL amyloidosis affects men
slightly more often than women. The average age of
diagnosed patients is 65 years and around 10% of
patients are less than 50 years old.
Clinical characteristics
Systemic AL amyloidosis
All organs can be affected in systemic AL amyloidosis,
except for central nervous system. The most frequent
presenting symptoms are asthenia and dyspnoea, which
are poorly specific and may account for delayed diagnosis. Organ involvement in systemic AL amyloidosis is
now defined by consensus criteria, which have been
updated at the 2010 meeting of the International Society
of Amyloidosis in Rome [Table 1] [3-5].
Kidney involvement is the most frequent, found in two
thirds of patients at the time of diagnosis. If renal manifestations are absent initially, they seldom appear during
follow-up. Characteristic presentation is with heavy proteinuria (composed mainly of albumin, with detectable
urine monoclonal Ig LC in most cases), with nephrotic
syndrome and decreased glomerular filtration rate in 20
to 45% of cases [6-8]. Contrasting with Randall-type
monoclonal LC deposition disease (LCDD), haematuria
and hypertension are uncommon. It is usually considered that increased kidney size is characteristic of AL
amyloid nephropathy, but this is not a constant feature,
as shown by echographic studies [8]. The diagnosis of
renal amyloidosis relies on the pathological demonstration of renal amyloid and/or, when a kidney biopsy is
not available, on histological evidence from another tissue with proteinuria ≥0.5 g/day predominantly composed of albumin [3,4].
Pathological heart involvement is present in up to 90%
of patients, and approximately 50% present with diastolic heart failure at the time of diagnosis [9]. Amyloid
heart disease is a major prognosis factor as it account
for approximately 75% of deaths, due to heart failure or
arrhythmia [10,11]. Amyloid deposition within the myocardium results in thickening of ventricular and atrial
walls leading to restrictive cardiopathy responsible for
progressively increasing asthenia, dyspnoea and lower

limb oedema. Infiltration of the cardiac muscle may also
induce conduction disorders and ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmias. Amyloid deposits sometimes
affect coronary arteries, and may manifest with symptoms of coronary heart disease or myocardial infarction
[10-12].
Peripheral nerve involvement, present in 20% of patients
with AL amyloidosis, is characterized by painful, slowly
progressing sensorimotor peripheral polyneuropathy, similar to diabetic neuropathy. Carpal tunnel syndrome is also
common. Autonomic neuropathy, isolated or associated
with symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, is a particularly
severe complication that manifests with gastroparesia,
diarrhoea or constipation, impotence and is often responsible for severe postural hypotension. The latter can be
extremely disabling, leading to prolonged decubitus and
greatly impacts on survival.
Often asymptomatic, gastro-intestinal tract involvement is common, as shown in over 80% of biopsies samples taken from the rectum or stomach. Usual symptoms
include impaired intestinal transit (possibly enhanced by
autonomic neuropathy) or occult bleeding. More severe
complications may occur, such as malabsorption, perforations, haemorrhages or acute intestinal obstruction.
Macroglossia, highly suggestive of AL amyloidosis, is
only found in 15% of cases. When severe, it may be
responsible for feeding problems and/or obstruction of
the upper airways (Figure 1A).
Hepatic manifestations, observed in 30% of patients,
usually consist of liver enlargement, accompanied by isolated increased serum alkaline phosphatase levels, without
evidence of hepatic failure. Liver disease is easily demonstrated by scintigraphy with 123I -labelled serum amyloid P
component (123I-SAP), which is currently not available in
all countries. Transient elastography (Fibroscan), a noninvasive method to evaluate hepatic stiffness should help
diagnose liver amyloidosis [13]. In rare cases, a severe
form of cholestatic hepatitis may occur, usually rapidly
fatal in the absence of efficient treatment.
Spleen involvement is nearly constant and usually
asymptomatic. In patients with massive deposits, signs of
hyposplenism (Howell-Joly bodies) may be detected on
blood smears often with thrombocytemia. Spontaneous
spleen rupture has been described in some patients.
Lung disease is mainly characterized by interstitial
amyloid infiltration (Figure 1E) whose clinical expression
depends on the diffusion and localization of deposits. Rapidly progressive respiratory deficiency may result from
bronchiolar and alveolar involvement. It appears to be
more frequent in patients with serum IgM paraprotein
[14]. Isolated lung nodules are usually related to localized
AL amyloidosis.
A wide range of skin lesions have been described, from
the characteristic periorbital haematoma, to various
papules, nodules, patches or, exceptionally, blisters,
mainly localized on the face and trunk (Figure 1B).
Joint symptoms manifest as progressive bilateral and
symmetrical polyarthropathy involving fingers, wrists,
shoulders and knees. Amyloid deposits may infiltrate
tendon sheaths resulting in the classical “shoulder pad”
sign. When they invade muscle belts they may cause
muscular enlargement, resulting in a “pseudo-athletic”
appearance (often associated with amyloid cardiopathy)
(Figure 1C).
The infiltration of the exocrine glands may be responsible for sicca syndrome and thyroid or adrenal deficiencies. Finally, AL amyloidosis is associated with a risk of
potentially serious haemorrhagic complications, resulting from vascular infiltration, sometimes combined with
deficit in coagulation factors (mainly in factor X, less
commonly in factors V or IX) or with increased fibrinolysis [2,6,7,15-17].
Localized AL amyloidosis
In some patients, AL amyloidosis is a localized
phenomenon, related to deposition of monoclonal LC
close to their synthesis by a focal plasma cell clone. Most
patients do not have evidence of monoclonal gammopathy. The bladder, urinary tract, tracheobronchial system,
lungs, larynx, ocular globe and skin are the main organs

or tissues involved in localized AL amyloidosis [15,18,19]
(Figure 1 G-H).
Etiology
AL amyloidosis results from extra-cellular deposition of
fibril-forming monoclonal Ig LC, usually produced by a
small plasma cell clone. Indeed, the average bone marrow plasma cell infiltration is around 7% [20,21]. While
a dystrophic appearance of plasma cells is observed in
around 70% of patients, progression towards symptomatic myeloma is exceptional. In the rare cases where AL
amyloidosis is associated with Waldenström’s disease or
non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma, an IgM paraprotein is
often detected [14]. In spite of the small tumour burden
of plasma cell proliferation, cytogenetic abnormalities
are observed with virtually the same frequency as in
multiple myeloma. Compared to multiple myeloma, t
(11;14) translocation appears to be more frequent, probably because it is generally associated with the secretion
of excess free LC [22]. A serum and/or urine monoclonal component is detectable by immunofixation and/or
immunoelectrophoresis in 80 to 90% of patients. With
the use of sensitive techniques, such as nephelemetric
measurement of serum free light chains (FLCs) an

abnormal concentration of serum free LCs is found in
more than 90% of patients, with an overrepresentation
of the λ-isotype [23].
The key event in the occurrence of amyloidosis is the
change in the secondary or tertiary structure of the abnormal monoclonal LC, which enables it to obtain, as for
all amyloidogenic proteins, at least two more or less
stable different conformations. This conformational
change is responsible for abnormal folding of the LC,
rich in β-sheets. The β-sheets are repetitive secondary
structures, consisting of folded alignments of peptides
bound by hydrogenous links between NH and CO
groups. These links occur between two different regions
of the peptide strands, or between two different peptide
strands, and facilitate formation of oligomers and their
precipitation. The amyloid substance is made up of
stacked protein monomers rich in β-sheets, which form
proto-filaments 2 to 5 nm in diameter that make up
fibrils. Amyloid fibrils display the appearance of a steel
cable made of clusters of 2 to 6 proto-filaments plaited
together. In all cases, the stacking is perpendicular to the
axis of the proto-filament β-sheets and generates a material
that specifically stains with Congo red or thioflavin
[1,24,25].
Not all LC are amyloidogenic. Several characteristics
indicate that LC primary structure are involved in the
propensity to form amyloid, including the overrepresentation of lambda LC (2 to 4 times more frequent than
kappa LC), and the association of homology family of
LC V region with organ tropism. For example the VλVI
variability subgroup is expressed exclusively in amyloidassociated monoclonal Ig and represents 41% of amyloidogenic λ-chains [26]. VλVI LC are frequently associated
with renal involvement. On the contrary expression of
the IGVL1-44 gene increased 5 times the odds of major
heart disease, [27], and kappa LC are more frequent in
patients with predominant hepatic disease [28,29].
As amyloid deposits assemble in various locations,
they generate a wide range of clinical symptoms. It is
usually considered that organ dysfunction is dependent
on the mechanical effect of deposits, as demonstrated by
the characteristic thickened rigidified cardiac muscle in
advanced amyloid heart disease. More recently, some
observations have suggested a direct toxic effect of monoclonal light chains in some tissues. In patients with severe amyloid heart disease, in whom rapid and complete
hematological response is obtained with chemotherapy,
spectacular improvement of cardiac symptoms may be
observed. It is accompanied by rapid decrease in serum
Nt-proBNP level, a sensitive marker of cardiac involvement [30], whereas cardiac deposits remain unchanged on
echocardiography. Amyloid LCs isolated from patients with
amyloid cardiomyopathy have been shown to specifically
provoke oxidative stress, cellular dysfunction and apoptosis
in isolated adult cardiomyocytes through activation of p38
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) [31,32].
Diagnosis
Diagnosis of AL amyloidosis
The diagnosis of amyloid is based on the finding, by light
microscopic examination, of amorphous extracellular
Congo red positive deposits, which display characteristic
dichroism and apple green birefringence under polarised
light. Congo red staining may be falsely negative if tissue
sections are less than 5 μm in thickness. Whenever possible, non-invasive biopsies of abdominal fat [33,34] and
minor salivary glands [35] should be performed initially.
If necessary, i.e. when tissue biopsies fail to demonstrate
amyloid deposition, or are insufficient for amyloid typing,
biopsy of a clinically affected organ (kidney, liver, gastrointestinal tract, endomyocardial tissue) should be considered. When a kidney biopsy is performed in patients with
renal involvement, it allows identification of Ig LC amyloid deposits in more than 80% of cases [36]. Deposits
predominate in the mesangium and along the glomerular
basement membranes. Interstitial and vascular deposits
are frequently observed, but they are rarely isolated
(Figure 2 A-E). Electron microscopy may be useful to confirm the presence of amyloid deposits, that typically display the ultrastructural appearance of randomly arranged
fibrils, 7 to 10 nm in external diameter [37-39] (Figure 2F).
The persistence of Congo-red positivity after treatment
of biopsy samples with potassium permanganate is suggestive, but not specific of AL amyloidosis. Furthermore,
the presence of a serum or urine paraprotein is not sufficient to establish the diagnosis of AL amyloidosis, because
of the frequency of monoclonal gammopathies in patients
aged over 50 years [40]. Whenever possible, efforts should
be made to correctly identify the immunoglobulinic composition of amyloid deposits. Amyloid typing relies primarily on immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded
tissue sections, and immunofluorescence microscopy on
frozen sections showing staining of deposits with a conjugate specific for kappa or lambda LC (Figure 2 C-E).
Immunofluorescence appears to be more reliable for the
diagnosis of AL amyloidosis, with a higher rate of successful typing than immunohistochemistry (65 to 85%,
versus 38 to 87%, respectively) [37]. However, due to
local proteolysis, LC in amyloid deposits often display
partial or complete deletion of the constant domain, which
is recognized by most commercial antibodies. Therefore,
adequate immunohistochemical diagnosis of AL requires
evaluation by experienced laboratories in which a large
panel of antibodies specific for lambda and kappa LC is
available, to maintain high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity [37,38]. In specialized centres, identification of
deposits may be achieved using immunoelectron microscopy [41] (Figure 2 G,H), or mass spectroscopic-based
Desport et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2012, 7:54 Page 5 of 13
http://www.ojrd.com/content/7/1/54

proteomic analysis of deposits after laser dissection of paraffin embedded samples. This new specific and sensitive
method, readily applicable in a clinical setting, allows rapid
typing of amyloid in most cases. Although it is currently
used only in specialized centres, it might decrease the percentage of non-typable amyloidosis in the near future [42].
Diagnosis of amyloid heart involvement
The diagnosis of amyloid heart disease relies on the association of electrocardiographic and echographic signs.
ECG signs, including microvoltage (QRS size < 0.5 cm)
in peripheral derivations and Q waves in precordial derivations, are particularly suggestive if they are accompanied
by cardiac hypertrophy. Ultrasound abnormalities are
characterized by a shiny and grainy aspect of the interventricular septum, with concentric cardiac hypertrophypredominating in the left ventricle. A septum
thickness > 15 mm in diastole indicates advanced amyloid
heart disease, associated with a median survival of
only 6 months if not treated. Measurement of the left

ventricular ejection fraction, and dilatation of the left
atrium are also prognostic markers [6,7,10-12]. New
techniques, such as diastolic color Doppler myocardial
velocity imaging and strain rate imaging, should improve
early detection of left ventricular dysfunction in patients
with AL amyloid heart disease [43]. Late gadolinium
enhancement-cardiac magnetic resonance may also detect
early cardiac abnormalities in patients with amyloidosis
with normal left ventricular thickness [44]. Troponins T
and I, B natriuretic peptide (BNP) or its N-terminal fraction (NT-proBNP) [30,45], and more recently, highsensitivity cardiac troponin T [46,47], are all sensitive
markers of diastolic dysfunction and represent reliable
prognostic markers in AL amyloidosis. Recently, it has
been proposed a prognostic score based on the serum
levels of troponin T and NT-proBNP , with 3 stages
defined by normal serum levels of troponin T and NTproBNP (stage 1), increase in one marker level (stage 2),
or in both (stage 3) with tresholds at 332 ng/l for NTproBNP and 0,035 μg/l for troponine T [45].
Differential diagnosis
Systemic AL amyloidoisis should be distinguished from
other forms of amyloidosis, related to different protein
precursors bearing an unstable tertiary structure enabling
the formation of fibrils. Various mechanisms of amyloid
deposition are involved in systemic amyloidosis: increased
serum levels of serum amyloid A protein (SAA) in AA
amyloidosis during chronic inflammatory or infectious
diseases, or increased β2microglobulin levels in chronic
dialysis patients. In hereditary amyloidosis, a mutation in
the gene encoding for the precursor results in increased
amyloidogenicity of the mutant protein. Although the
transmission of all types of hereditary amyloidosis is
autosomal dominant, a suggestive family history is often
lacking due to incomplete penetrance of the mutation
[48]. Therefore, in the absence of unequivocal staining
with an anti-LC antibody, additional immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry studies should be performed to verify the absence of staining with antibodies
specific for amyloid precursors found in hereditary amyloidosis (i.e. lysozyme, apolipoprotein A1, apoliprotein
A2, fibrinogen, gelsolin and transthyretin). Moreover,
genetic studies seeking for an amyloidogenic mutation
of the genes encoding for the precursors cited above
should be rapidly undertaken, with, if available, mass
spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of biopsy samples
after laser microdissection.
AL amyloidosis should be also differentiated from
Randall-type LCDD, a systemic disease characterized by
LC deposition, along basement membranes in most
tissues. Kidney involvement is nearly constant. Most
patients present with symptoms of glomerular disease,
including proteinuria with nephrotic syndrome in around
half of the cases, and nearly constant impaired renal
function. By contrast with AL amyloidosis, hypertension
and microscopic hematuria are more commonly observed,
whereas extra-renal manifestations, including heart and
liver disease are rarely symptomatic at presentation.
Furthermore, LCDD is associated with multiple myeloma
is 30 to 60% of the cases, and a monoclonal Ig is detectable in the serum and/or urine in up to 90% of patients
[49,50]. Diagnosis of LCCD is usually made after pathological examination of a kidney biopsy. Tubular lesions
are constant, characterized by Congo red–negative periodic acid–Schiff-positive deposits along basement membranes, usually associated with marked interstitial fibrosis,
and in two thirds of cases, with nodular glomerulosclerosis. Immunofluorescence study is mandatory to
confirm the diagnosis, showing linear continuous deposits
along tubular basement membranes, and, in most cases,
along glomerular basement membranes and around
arteriolar myocytes. At variance with AL amyloidosis,
the κ LC isotype is 2 to 3 times more frequent than
the λ isotype, with a predominance of the Vκ4 subgroub [51]. Electron microscopy typically shows granular,
non organized electron dense deposits with a linear distribution along tubular, glomerular and arteriolar basement membranes [39,49,50].
Management including treatment
Specific treatment
Treatment of systemic AL amyloidosis relies mainly on
chemotherapy aimed at suppressing the underlying
plasma cell clone secreting amyloid-forming Ig LC. AL
amyloidosis results from a balance between amyloid deposition and clearance of deposits. The decrease or halting in the production of amyloidogenic proteins thanks
to the treatment moves the balance towards the tissue
catabolism of deposits [1]. The degree of reduction of
monoclonal protein secretion required for regression of
amyloid deposits depends on individual factors and on
the affected organ: a decrease in hepatic deposits will
often be apparent within 3 or 4 months, even if the reduction in serum free LC levels is not complete, whereas
regression of amyloid infiltration of the cardiac muscle
will take several years.
Therefore, treatment of AL amyloidosis is equal to
treatment of the underlying plasma cell, lymphoplasmocytic or lymphoproliferative disorder that is responsible
for the secretion of the amyloid precursor. All treatment
strategies which have shown efficiency in multiple myeloma or in lymphoproliferative disorders can be used,
adapted to the type of the causal haematological disease,
to the nature and number of affected organs, and bearing
in mind their potential toxicity. The goal of treatment
should be the achievement of hematologic response, partial response which is now defined by a ≥ 50% reduction
Desport et al. Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2012, 7:54 Page 7 of 13

in the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC
(dFLC), very good partial response (VGPR) by a dFLC
less than 40 mg/l, and complete response (CR) being
assessed by the absence of detectable monoclonal Ig with
normal sFLCs and kappa/lambda ratio (Table 2) [3-5].
Only 15 years ago, overall survival in AL amyloidosis
was poor, as demonstrated in two randomized studies
which showed that a combination of melphalan plus prednisone (MP) had limited beneficial effect, with a median
overall survival of 18 months, compared to 12 months in
patients who received no treatment or colchicine therapy
alone [52,53]. Since then, the prognosis of the disease has
been transformed with the development of new strategies
that efficiently suppress the secretion of the amyloid
forming LCs. Table 3 and 4 report the results of high
dose mephalan followed by autologous blood stem cell
transplantation (HDM/SCT) and conventional treatment
studies in AL amyloidosis [54-67].
HDM/SCT
The feasibility and efficacy of HDM/SCT in systemic AL
amyloidosis was first demonstrated by Ray Comenzo
and colleagues [68,69]. The protocol includes a step of
stem cell collection after mobilization through injections
of G-CSF-type growth factor, followed by high-dose
melphalan of 100 to 200 mg/m2
, depending on the
patient’s age and extent of disease. In experienced centers, this strategy results in a haematological response
rate of more than 60%, including 40% complete
responses (CR), and a median survival around 4.5 years
[54]. However, due to the high toxicity of HDM/SCT,
only certain patients benefit; indeed, treatment-related
mortality (TRM) approaches 10% even in the largest centers after careful patient selection. In a recent review of
421 consecutive patients treated with HDM/SCT, TRM
was 11.4% for all patients over 15 years, and 5.3% in the
last 5 years, with improved patient selection and experienced management [57]. Whether HDM/SCT should be
followed by consolidation and maintenance therapy to
improve quality and duration of hematologic responses
remains to be established; in a recent phase II study,
consolidation with bortezomib and dexamethasone following risk-adapted HDM/SCT resulted in high overall
and stringent complete response rates (59 and 28%, respectively), with good tolerance [70].
However, although more than 50 studies have confirmed
its efficacy over the last ten years, HDM/SCT in AL amyloidosis remains restricted to selected patients, generally
those aged less than 65 years, with a maximum of two
organs involved and without advanced cardiac amyloidosis. As eligibility for hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation has been shown to be a favourable prognostic
factor for survival [71], the place of HDM/SCT as firstline therapy in systemic AL amyloidosis is questionable.
Conventional chemotherapy
In parallel, several studies have shown the efficacy of highdose dexamethasone-based regimens at inducing haematological responses and prolonging survival. Unexpected
efficacy, close to that of HDM/SCT, was reported with
the vincristin–adriamycin–dexamethasone (VAD) and
melphalan dexamethasone (M-Dex) regimens [21,61].

M-Dex consists of melphalan 10 mg/m2/day and dexamethasone 40 mg/day, 4 days/month, of which doses
should be adapted according to glomerular filtration
rate and age. The M-Dex association is more rapidly
effective than the classical Melphalan plus Prednisone
regimen, as it allows a 58 to 67% haematological response rate, including 13 to 33% of complete responses
and clinical responses in 50% of patients [21,61,72]. Due
to a low toxicity profile, with a TRM between 2 and 7%,
dexamethasone-based regimens may be used even in
patients with advanced disease. In 2007, a French multicentre randomized prospective trial showed that, compared to HDM/SCT, M-Dex had similar efficacy with less
toxicity, resulting in increased survival. One hundred
patients with newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis were randomly assigned to receive intravenous high-dose melphalan (200 mg/m2
, tapered down to 140 mg/m2 in patients
aged over 65 years and in those with advanced heart,
kidney or liver disease), followed by SCT, or oral M-Dex,
4 days per month. Although hematologic and organ
responses did not differ significantly between the two
treatment groups, the mortality rate in the first 100 days
was higher in the group assigned to receive HDM/SCT.
After a median follow-up of 3 years, in the intentionto-treat analysis, the estimated overall survival was
22.2 months in the HDM/SCT group, and 56.9 months
in the group assigned to received oral M-Dex (P = 0.04).
Overall survival was non-significantly different in the two
groups, among patients with high-risk disease and among
those with low-risk disease. Furthermore, a landmark
analysis showed that survival was also similar in patients
who survived at least 6 months after randomization and
who received their assigned treatment [21].
Therefore, the place of HDM/SCT as first-line treatment for systemic AL amyloidosis is currently debated.
Whereas it is still commonly employed in the USA in
young patients without severe disease, it is no longer
used in most European countries except Germany, and
M-Dex represents the most common chemotherapy
regimen in European patients with systemic AL amyloidosis associated with an IgG, IgA or isolated LC monoclonal gammopathy. There is currently no consensus on the
duration of treatment with M-Dex, which should be carefully evaluated in each individual case. In patients who
achieve a haematological response (usually after a median
of 2 to 4 cycles), treatment is usually maintained for 3
additional cycles, in order to increase the duration of
remission. M-Dex should be given for no longer than 9
to 12 months, in order to reduce the risk of secondary
myelodysplasia and acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia [73].
In patients with underlying lymphoplasmocytic proliferation, (usually associated with an IgM monoclonal gammopathy), treatment regimens are identical to those used in
Waldenström’s disease, i.e. Fludarabine-CyclophosphamideRituximab, Cyclophosphamide-Dexamethasone-Rituximab
or Bortezomib-Dexamethasone-Rituximab. HDM/SCT also
appears to be effective [14,74].
As the regression of amyloid deposits is slow, surveillance and evaluation of treatment rely on serial measurements of serum monoclonal immunoglobulin level, at
best by the dosage of serum FLCs. In spite of the slow
elimination of deposits, the global response to treatment
has to be regularly assessed in terms of clinical response,
which determines both short-term (symptomatic amyloid
heart disease) and long-term prognosis (progression of
chronic kidney disease). Criteria for organ response are
given in Table 5. Routine measurements of serum NTproBNP levels in patients with cardiac involvement is important, as a 30% decrease in serum level after 3 cycles of
chemotherapy is predictive of a favourable outcome
[30,45,46].
Novel agents
In the absence of haematological response, prognosis is
rapidly engaged and the more serious the disease (e.g.:
symptomatic heart disease), the quicker the treatment has
to be modified. Several preliminary studies have shown
encouraging results with novel anti-myeloma drugs such

as thalidomide, lenalidomide and the proteasome inhibitor
bortezomib [62-67,75-80]. Combined with dexamethasone, these agents induce rapid haematological responses
in most patients, even in those with refractory or relapsing
disease. The cyclophosphamide, thalidomide and dexamethasone regimen appears to produce similar results as
M-Dex alone [62], whereas the combination of M-Dex
with lenalidomide slightly increases haematological response rates [63]. A striking difference has been observed
with the introduction of bortezomib, which results in
clonal response rates of 70-90%, including around 40%
of CR. Furthermore, the bortezomib plus dexamethasone regimen has shown remarkable efficacy in previously treated patients with refractory disease. These high
hematological response rates are achieved with manageable toxicity and within a relatively short time span
[64-67,77-80]. In a recent phase II study, M-Dex plus
bortezomib induced a 94% haematological response rate,
with 60% CR [80]. This combination will be soon compared to M-Dex in an international randomized trial.
Bortezomib may also be combined with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone with a good tolerance and impressive response rates (74,75). Bortezomib has to be
used with caution in patients with advanced amyloid
heart disease, who may occasionally develop abrupt reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction. Nevertheless,
due to their superior tolerability and efficacy compared
to ASCT and M-Dex, bortezomib-based regimens will
probably become first-line therapy in systemic AL amyloidosis in the near future.
Localized AL amyloidosis
In patients with localized AL amyloidosis, local therapy,
mainly based on surgical or laser excision, is usually efficient, and, in most cases, systemic chemotherapy is not
required. In some patients with life-threatening symptoms
due to local obstruction (namely of the upper airways),
local radiotherapy should be considered to eradicate the
underlying LC producing clone [18,19,81].
Symptomatic treatment
Apart from specific treatment of the underlying haematological disease, symptomatic measures and supportive
care is necessary in patients with organ failure. Most
drugs commonly used for the treatment of cardiac failure (i.e. calcium inhibitors, β-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors) are inefficient or even
dangerous in patients with amyloid heart disease. Digitalics, which should be used cautiously, are only indicated
for the treatment of rapid arrhythmia. Loop diuretics are
useful, when given at high dosage in patients with severe
fluid retention. Amiodarone should be considered as first
line therapy for arrhythmia. Pacemaker implantation may
be indicated in patients who develop symptomatic bradycardia or conduction disorders. Finally, cardiac transplantation should be considered in selected patients with
advanced amyloid cardiopathy [10-12,82,83].
Clinical follow-up of amyloid nephropathy is based on
routine surveillance of serum creatinine, urea, total proteins, albumin, and 24-hour proteinuria. In patients with
nephrotic syndrome, control of fluid retention relies on
loop diuretics, often given at a high dose, or combined
with other diuretics. Nephrotic syndrome may persist in
patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and require
therapeutic intervention to stop diuresis. In a recent
series, 13% out of 752 patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate >15 ml/min at baseline progressed
to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), after a median time of
26.8 months [8]. Chronic dialysis is indicated in patients
with AL amyloidosis and ESRD, hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis being associated with similar survival.
Kidney transplantation may also be offered to selected
patients who have achieved persistent haematological
remission, at least for one year [82]. When solid organ
transplantion is considered (heart, liver, kidney), it should
be necessarily preceded or followed by chemotherapy in
order to avoid systemic progression and amyloid recurrence on the implanted organ [82-85].
Very few effective treatments are currently available
for autonomic neuropathy, often responsible for severe
postural hypotension, which accounts for significant
morbidity and mortality. Wearing of support stockings is
recommended, together with midodrine 2.5 mg x 3/day,
to be increased up to 10 mg x 3/day. Fludrocortisone is
also worth trying, but it is often poorly tolerated as it
may increase fluid retention [86].
Prognosis
In AL amyloidosis, survival depends on haematological
response to therapy, on the extension and severity of

organ involvement, and on the presence or not of amyloid heart disease. Prognosis is not influenced by the
underlying plasma cell proliferation. However, identification of a neoplastic plasma cell population adversely
affects survival [87], and a bone marrow plasma cell infiltration above 10% has been associated with poorer
outcome [88]. AL amyloidosis is a serious disease and
causes death when treatment is delayed, whereas new
therapeutic strategies induce haematological remission
in most patients, with a median survival of more than
5 years. Early diagnosis is therefore a critical step in the
care of these patients.
Unresolved questions
In spite of the definite improvement in survival over the
last few years with the development of new chemotherapy regimens, there is currently no treatment able to accelerate the catabolism of AL amyloid deposits. All
available therapeutic strategies work by reducing the production of the amyloidogenic precursor, thus enabling
the body to slowly eliminate existing deposits. Research
is currently underway to develop treatments that would
increase tissue catabolism of amyloid deposits. Serum
amyloid P protein (SAP) is an important component of
all amyloid fibrils, which stabilize fibrils and make them
resistant to proteolysis. Recently, CPHPC, a molecule
able to rapidly decrease circulating SAP levels has been
developed [89]. The combination of this molecule with
an antibody specific for SAP, which targets amyloid
deposits and enables their elimination by recruiting
phagocyte cells, has shown impressive results in an experimental model of systemic amyloidosis in mice [90]. A
trial that will evaluate the effect of this approach for the
treatment of AL amyloidosis in humans is planned in the
next future.
