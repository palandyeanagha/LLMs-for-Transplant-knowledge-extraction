Introduction 
Guidelines on the management of hepatitis C were first developed in 2004 and revised in 2013 and 2015 by the Korean Association for the Study of the Liver (KASL). Recently, paradigms for 
the treatment of chronic hepatitis C have changed from interferon 
(IFN) alpha–based treatment to direct-acting antiviral agents 
(DAA). Compared with IFN, the higher sustained virologic response rate (SVR) of around 95%, lower adverse events, and convenience of DAAs for hepatitis C approaches the ideal goals of 
antiviral treatment. However, treatment for individual patients remains complex because treatment regimens and durations can 
differ depending on previous treatment experience, virus genotype and subtype, and the presence or absence of underlying liver 
cirrhosis. Furthermore, re-treatment options for patients who 
failed on previous DAA are limited. Since the first release of DAA, 
there have been many developments, including the introduction 
of pan-genotypic DAAs, new antivirals against resistance-associated substitutions (RASs), and the publication of many novel research results from Korea and other countries. 
Therefore, this clinical practice guideline, Management of hepatitis C: Treatment of chronic hepatitis C, has been revised in the 
areas of treatment, research, and education. These recommendations are not absolute standards of care, and adoption of the 
guidelines in clinical practice might need to differ among individual patients.

Target populations
The target groups for these guidelines are newly or previously 
diagnosed patients with hepatitis C virus infection (HCV), including patients with chronic hepatitis C with cirrhosis, hepatitis C patients with chronic kidney disease, and those co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV).
Intended users
These guidelines are intended to provide useful information and 
guidance to physicians and healthcare providers involved in the 
diagnosis and treatment of hepatitis C, along with resident physicians, practitioners, and trainers. 
Development, funding, and revision process
The Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee for the Management 
of Hepatitis C, comprising 10 hepatologists, was organized according to a proposal by and the approval of the KASL Board of 
Executives. Funding for the revision was provided by KASL. Each 
committee member collected and analyzed the source data in his 
or her own field, and the members then wrote the manuscript together. 
Literature review for evidence collection 
The committee systematically collected and reviewed the international and domestic literature published before September 2017 
in PubMed, MEDLINE, KoreaMed, and other databases. The keywords used were ‘hepatitis C virus’, ‘hepatitis C’, ‘liver cirrhosis’, 
‘liver cancer’, and other specific related keywords. 
Level of evidence and grades of recommendations
The quality of evidence is classified using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation 
(GRADE) system (Table 1).1
 Based on the types of study, randomized controlled studies were approached as providing a high level 
of evidence, whereas observational studies were approached as 
providing a low level of evidence. Then, the levels of evidence 
were adjusted by accounting for the factors that influence study 
quality. The levels of evidence are defined as follows: A, the highest level of evidence with the smallest possibility of changes in the 
conclusion; B, a moderate risk of potential changes; and C, the 
lowest level of evidence with the greatest possibility of changes. 
The strength of each recommendation is also classified according to the GRADE system. Each study was classified as a strong 
recommendation (1) or weak recommendation (2) based on the 
quality of evidence, the balance between the desirable and undesirable effects of an intervention, and socioeconomic aspects, including cost and availability. A strong recommendation indicates 
that the intervention could be applied for most patients with a 
strong certainty that desirable effects are highly possible with 
high-quality evidence, presumed patient-important outcomes, 
cost-effectiveness, preference, and compliance. A weak recommendation indicates a suggestion made with less certainty but 
that still could be considered favorable for many patients based 
Table 1. Grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE)
Criteria
Quality of evidence
High (A) Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect.
Moderate (B) Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may 
change the estimate.
Low (C) Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is 
likely to change the estimate. Any change of estimate is uncertain. 
Strength of recommendation 
Strong (1) Factors influencing the strength of the recommendation include the quality of the evidence, presumed 
patient-important outcomes, and cost.
Weak (2) Variability in preference and values, or more uncertainty. Recommnedation is made with less certainty, 
higher cost or resource consumption.
Of the quality of evidence, this guideline excluded "very low quality (D)" in our guideline for convenience, which was originally included in the GRADE system.

List of key questions
The revision committee considered the following clinical questions as the key components to be covered in these guidelines. 
1. What are the characteristics and indications of new kinds of 
DAAs?
2. What are the recent updates in drug–drug interactions?
3. What is the definition, detection method, and clinical application of resistance associated substitutions (RASs)?
4. How should patients with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis and 
compensated cirrhosis be treated?
5. How should patients with genotype 2 chronic hepatitis and 
compensated cirrhosis be treated?
6. How should patients with genotype 3 chronic hepatitis and 
compensated cirrhosis be treated?
7. How should patients with genotype 4 chronic hepatitis and 
compensated cirrhosis be treated?
8. How should patients with genotype 5 or 6 chronic hepatitis 
and compensated cirrhosis be treated?
9. How should patients with decompensated cirrhosis be treated?
10. How should patients who underwent liver or extrahepatic 
organ transplantation be treated?
11. How should patients with special conditions (people who 
inject drug, chronic kidney disease, coinfection with HIV or HBV, 
hemophilia or thalassemia, immunosuppressive therapy or cytotoxic chemotherapy, and pediatric patients) be treated?
12. How should patients who failed on previous direct antiviral 
agents be treated? 
Review of the manuscript and approval process
Each manuscript written by committee members was reviewed, 
agreed, and approved through meetings of the committee. The 
quality of the manuscript was evaluated based on the standards 
suggested by Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation 
II (AGREE II), along with the academic integrity of the contents. 
The guidelines were reviewed and revised based on counsel from 
an infection specialist, a meeting of an external review board of 7 
KASL members, opinions at a public hearing, and a symposium 
open to all KASL members. The final manuscript was approved by 
the KASL Board of Executives. 
Release of the guidelines and plan for updates
The Korean version of the KASL Clinical Practice Guidelines for 
the Management of Hepatitis C: Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis C
was released in November 2017 at a KASL meeting and published 
in November 2017 on the KASL website (http://www.kasl.org). 
Future plans for revision will be made when the accumulation of 
research on the management of hepatitis C makes revision necessary for the promotion of health in South Korea. In addition, the 
use of new DAAs will be allowed in South Korea in the near future, which might warrant updates or revisions to the guidelines. 
Direct acting antivirals (DAAS)
Recently, the paradigm for treating hepatitis C changed rapidly 
as newly developed oral antiviral agents, DAAs, became available. DAAs show antiviral effects by directly acting on the life cycle of the hepatitis C virus (HCV). DAAs are classified into HCV 
nonstructural protein (NS) 3/4A protease inhibitors, NS5A inhibitors, and NS5B polymerase inhibitors, depending on their site of 
action. NS3/4A protease inhibitors are first-generation DAAs that 
block the polyprotein processing essential for HCV replication. 
Following the first-generation protease inhibitors (boceprevir and 
telaprevir), simeprevir, asunaprevir, paritaprevir, grazoprevir, voxilaprevir, and glecaprevir were developed.2
 NS5A inhibitors affect 
HCV replication and assembly, showing a synergistic effect in 
combination with other DAAs. They include daclatasvir, ledipasvir, 
ombitasvir, elbasvir, velpatasvir, and pibrentasvir. NS5B polymerase inhibitors include sofosbuvir and dasabuvir.
As of 2017, the DAAs sofosbuvir, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, daclatasvir, asunaprevir, ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, dasabuvir, elbasvir/grazoprevir were approved in Korea (Table 2). In the United 
States and Europe, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir was approved in 2016, 
and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir and glecaprevir/pibrentasvir were approved in 2017.
Given an understanding of the basic characteristics, doses, and 
posology of each DAA, the selection and use of appropriate drugs 
should consider hepatic and renal function. DAA regimens can interact with other medications used by patients. Prior to starting 
treatment, patients should be evaluated for potential drug–drug 
interactions with selected DAAs (Table 3, 4). A comprehensive list 
of drug–drug interactions is available at several websites, such as 
www.hep-druginteractions.org, and in the prescribing information for each drug.2-8

[Recommendations]
1. Clinicians should understand the characteristics of each DAA 
and choose the most appropriate drug for each patient, with 
consideration of hepatic and renal function (A1).
2. The potential for drug–drug interactions must be considered 
before and during treatment with DAAs. Full prescribing 
information must be consulted prior to the use of DAAs because 
of the potential for drug–drug interactions (A1).
Sofosbuvir
Sofosbuvir is an HCV NS5B polymerase inhibitor.
Dosage and administration
Sofosbuvir should be administered orally at the dose of 400 mg 
(one tablet) once daily, with or without food.
Pharmacokinetics
Sofosbuvir is metabolized in the liver by the cathepsin A, carboxylesterase 1, histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1, and pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis pathway. GS-331007 is a major 
metabolite of sofosbuvir, of which approximately 80% is excreted 
in urine, and 15% is excreted in feces. No dosage adjustment of 
sofosbuvir is required for patients with hepatic impairment. Compared to subjects with normal renal function (eGFR >80 mL/min), 
the area under the curve (AUC) of sofosbuvir and GS-331007 
were 1.7-fold and 4.5-fold higher, respectively, in patients with 
severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min) and that of GS331007 was increased up to 20-fold in patients with end-stage 
renal disease (ESRD). Thus, no dosage adjustment of sofosbuvir is 
required for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment 
(eGFR 30-80 mL/min). Sofosbuvir is not recommended for use in 
patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min) or 
ESRD requiring dialysis.
Drug–drug interactions
Sofosbuvir is a substrate of the drug transporter P-glycoprotein 
(P-gp) and the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Strong 
P-gp inducers, including anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin), antituberculosis drugs (rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine), and the herbal product St. John’s 
wort, could decrease the plasma concentration of sofosbuvir, 
causing reduced therapeutic efficacy. Thus, concomitant use of 
those substances with sofosbuvir is not recommended. In addition, because serious symptomatic bradycardia can occur, co-administration of amiodarone with sofosbuvir is contraindicated.

Adverse reactions and safety
The most common adverse reactions observed with sofosbuvir 
in combination with ribavirin were fatigue and headache, insomnia, pruritus, and anemia.
Ledipasvir/sofosbuvir
Ledipasvir is an HCV NS5A inhibitor, and sofosbuvir is an HCV 
NS5B polymerase inhibitor.
Dosage and administration
Ledipasvir/sofosbuvir is a fixed-dose combination of ledipasvir 
(90 mg) and sofosbuvir (400 mg) in a single tablet and should be 
administered at the dose of one tablet orally once a day, with or 
without food.
Pharmacokinetics
Ledipasvir is subject to slow oxidative metabolism via a still unknown mechanism. Ledipasvir is mainly excreted in feces, whereas, sofosbuvir is extensively excreted via the kidneys. No dosage 
adjustment of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir is required for patients with 
hepatic impairment due to minimal effects in the plasma concentration of the drug. No dose adjustment is required for patients 
with mild or moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30-80 mL/min), 
but it is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal 
impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min) or ESRD because its safety is not 
established in that population.
Drug–drug interactions
Ledipasvir and sofosbuvir are substrates of the drug transporters P-gp and BCRP. Strong P-gp inducers, such as antituberculosis 
drugs (rifampin, rifapentine, rifabutin), anticonvulsants (carbamCo-medications SOF LDV/SOF DCV ASV OPr-D EBR/GZR G/P SOF/VEL SOF/VEL/VOX

azepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin), and the herbal 
product St. John’s wort, could decrease the plasma concentration 
of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir and cause reduced therapeutic efficacy. 
Thus, concomitant use of those substances with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir is not recommended. Ledipasvir is an inhibitor of drug transporters such as P-gp, BCRP, and organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP). Co-administration of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir with 
P-gp substrates (digoxin, dabigatran) could increase the concentration of each drug, requiring careful monitoring for therapeutic 
concentration or side effects. Co-administration with rosuvastatin 
is contraindicated because ledipasvir inhibits OATP, leading to a 
significant increase in the concentration of rosuvastatin. In addition, caution about adverse reactions is warranted if other HMGCoA reductase inhibitors (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, 
pitavastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin) are used. Co-administration 
of amiodarone (and possibly dronedarone) with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir is contraindicated due to serious risk of symptomatic bradycardia. Because the solubility of ledipasvir decreases with increasing pH, drugs that increase gastric pH are expected to decrease 
the concentration of ledipasvir. It is therefore recommended to 
separate antacids and ledipasvir/sofosbuvir by 4 hours. H2-receptor antagonists may be administered simultaneously with or 12 
hours apart from ledipasvir/sofosbuvir at a dose that does not exceed doses comparable to famotidine 40 mg twice daily. Protonpump inhibitors can be administered at doses comparable to 
omeprazole 20 mg or lower, but at higher doses, they might decrease the efficacy of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir. Because ledipasvir/sofosbuvir increases the tenofovir concentration when a pharmacokinetic enhancer (ritonavir or cobicistat) is included in an 
antiretroviral regimen, combinations such as atazanavir/ritonavir, 
darunavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, elvitegravir/cobicistat, atazanavir/cobicistat, or darunavir/cobicistat in combination with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine should be used with 
caution and frequent renal monitoring.
Adverse reactions and safety
The most common adverse reactions observed with ledipasvir/
sofosbuvir were fatigue, headache, diarrhea, and insomnia.
Daclatasvir
Daclatasvir is an HCV NS5A inhibitor.
Dosage and administration
Daclatasvir is orally administered at the dose of 60 mg (one 
tablet) once daily with or without food. Dose modification of daclatasvir is needed if a CYP3A inhibitor or inducer is co-administered. If a strong CYP3A inhibitor is co-administered, the dose of 
daclatasvir should be reduced to one 30 mg tablet once daily. If a 
moderate CYP3A inducer is co-administered, the dose of daclatasvir should be increased to one 90 mg tablet once daily. Co-administration with a strong CYP3A inducer is contraindicated.
Pharmacokinetics
Daclatasvir is metabolized by CYP3A. Approximately 90% of 
daclatasvir is eliminated in feces, with less than 10% excreted in 
urine. Hepatic impairment does not have a clinically significant effect on the free drug concentration of daclatasvir. Thus, no dosage adjustment of daclatasvir is required for patients with any degree of hepatic or renal impairment. 
Drug–drug interactions
Co-administration of daclatasvir with substances that are moderate or strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 is not recommended because it can significantly alter the exposure to daclatasvir. Strong CYP3A inducers, including anticonvulsants 
(carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin), the 
herbal product St. John’s wort, and the antituberculosis drug rifampin, are contraindicated. Strong CYP3A inhibitors, including 
antiretrovirals (atazanavir, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, saquinavir, atazanavir/cobicistat, elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), antifungals (itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole), macrolides (clarithromycin, 
telithromycin), the antidepressant nefazodone, and calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil), can increase the plasma concentration of daclatasvir. Thus, the dose of daclatasvir should be 
decreased, or co-administration is not recommended. Moderate 
CYP3A inducers, including antibiotics (nafcillin, rifapentine), the 
endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan, the systemic steroid 
dexamethasone, antiretrovirals (efavirenz, etravirine, nevirapine), 
and the stimulant drug modafinil, can decrease the plasma concentration of daclatasvir. Thus, the dose of daclatasvir should be 
increased, or co-administration is not recommended. Daclatasvir 
is an inhibitor of P-gp, OATP1B1 and 1B3, and BCRP. Therefore, 
co-administration with the antiarrhythmic digoxin or HMG-CoA 
reductase inhibitors (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pitavastatin, 
pravastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin) increases the plasma concentration of each drug, requiring caution for adverse reactions. 
Co-administration of daclatasvir and sofosbuvir with amiodarone 
is contraindicated due to a serious risk of severe bradycardia.

Adverse reactions and safety
The most common adverse reactions observed with daclatasvir 
in combination with asunaprevir were headache, fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation.
Asunaprevir
Asunaprevir is an HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitor.
Dosage and administration
Asunaprevir should be orally administered at the dose of 100 
mg (one capsule) twice a day with or without food.
Pharmacokinetics
Asunaprevir is metabolized by CYP3A in the liver and mostly 
eliminated via bile. Compared to subjects with normal hepatic 
function, the plasma concentration of asunaprevir is not significantly altered in patients with Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) class A 
cirrhosis, whereas, it can be increased 5-fold and 23-fold in CTP 
class B and C patients, respectively. Thus, asunaprevir is contraindicated for patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment 
(CTP class B or C). No dosage adjustment is required for patients 
with mild or moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30–80 mL/min). A 
dosage adjustment of asunaprevir to 100 mg once daily is recommended for patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/
min) not receiving hemodialysis because the AUC of asunaprevir 
in those patients increases 2-fold compared with subjects with 
normal renal function.
Drug–drug interactions
The drug–drug interactions of asunaprevir with co-medications 
can be found in the prescribing information of asunaprevir. Coadministration of asunaprevir, an inhibitor of CYP2D6, with antiarrhythmics (flecainide, propafenone) or the antipsychotic thioridazine can cause severe arrhythmia and is thus contraindicated. 
Strong or moderate CYP3A inducers, including anticonvulsants 
(carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin), antituberculosis drugs (rifampin, rifabutin), the endothelin receptor 
antagonist bosentan, the systemic steroid dexamethasone, the 
herbal product St. John’s wort, antiretrovirals (efavirenz, etravirine, nevirapine), and the stimulant drug modafinil, can decrease 
the plasma concentration of asunaprevir, with possible loss of efficacy. Thus, co-administration is contraindicated. In addition, 
strong inhibitors of OATP1B1 or 2B1, such as the antituberculosis 
drug rifampin, the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine, and the 
lipid lowering drug gemfibrozil, can decrease the therapeutic effect of asunaprevir by reducing its intrahepatic levels. Thus, coadministration is not recommended. Strong or moderate CYP3A 
inhibitors, including antifungals (fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole), macrolides (clarithromycin, 
erythromycin), calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil), 
antiretrovirals (atazanavir, darunavir, fosamprenavir, indinavir, 
lopinavir, saquinavir), and pharmacokinetic enhancers (cobicistat, 
ritonavir), can increase plasma levels of asunaprevir and cause severe adverse events. Thus, co-administration is contraindicated. 
Asunaprevir is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6 and an inhibitor of 
OATP 1B1/1B3 and P-gp. Therefore, co-administration of asunaprevir with substrates of those transporters, including the anticoagulant dabigatran, antiarrhythmics (digoxin, flecainide), HMGCoA reductase inhibitors (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pitavastatin, 
pravastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin), the antidepressant amitriptyline, and the antitussive dextromethorphan, can increase the 
plasma levels of each drug. Thus, close clinical monitoring and 
caution are warranted.
Adverse reactions and safety
The most common adverse events observed with asunaprevir in 
combination with daclatasvir were headache, fatigue, diarrhea, 
nausea, and ALT elevation. The frequency of ALT elevation more 
than 5 times the upper limit of normal was 3 to 4%, and the frequency of bilirubin elevation more than 2.6 times the upper limit 
of normal was 1%. Therefore, frequent monitoring of liver function is required to consider possible hepatotoxicity in patients receiving asunaprevir-containing regimens.
Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, dasabuvir
Ombitasvir is an inhibitor of HCV NS5A; paritaprevir is an HCV 
NS3/4A protease inhibitor; and ritonavir, a pharmacokinetic enhancer, is an inhibitor of CYP3A4. Dasabuvir is an HCV NS5B 
polymerase inhibitor.
Dosage and administration
Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir is a fixed-dose combination 
containing ombitasvir (12.5 mg), paritaprevir (75 mg), and ritonavir (50 mg) in a single tablet that should be orally administered at 
the dose of two tablets once a day with food. Dasabuvir is orally 
administered at the dose of 250 mg (one tablet) twice a day with 
food.

178 http://www.e-cmh.org
Clin Mol Hepatol
Volume_24 Number_3 September 2018
https://doi.org/10.3350/cmh.2018.1004
Pharmacokinetics
Ombitasvir is predominantly metabolized by amide hydrolysis 
followed by oxidative metabolism. Paritaprevir is predominantly 
metabolized by CYP3A4, and dasabuvir is metabolized by CYP2C8. Ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and dasabuvir are excreted extensively into the feces. The AUC of paritaprevir increases 1.6-fold in 
patients with moderate hepatic impairment (CTP class B). The 
AUC of paritaprevir and dasabuvir increase 9-fold and 3-fold, respectively, in patients with severe hepatic impairment (CTP class 
C). Therefore, no dosage adjustment is required in patients with 
mild hepatic impairment (CTP class A). However, this regimen is 
not recommended for patients with moderate or severe hepatic 
impairment (CTP class B or C). No dosage adjustment is required 
in patients with any degree of renal impairment not on dialysis. 
This regimen has not been studied in patients on dialysis.
Drug–drug interactions
Moderate or strong CYP3A4 inducers and CYP2C8 inducers decrease the plasma concentration of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir, leading to reduced therapeutic efficacy. Thus, 
co-administration with anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin), the antituberculosis drug rifampin, the herbal product St. John’s wort, the antiretroviral efavirenz, and the endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan is 
contraindicated. Strong CYP2C8 inhibitors increase the plasma 
concentration of dasabuvir, which is associated with the risk of QT 
prolongation; thus, antifungals (itraconazole, ketoconazole, 
posaconazole, voriconazole), macrolides (clarithromycin, telithromycin), and the lipid lowering drug gemfibrozil are contraindicated. Ritonavir strongly inhibits CYP3A4; paritaprevir inhibits OATP1B1, OATP1B3, BRCP, and P-gp; and dasabuvir and ritonavir 
inhibit P-gp and BRCP. Co-administration with substrate drugs of 
those enzymes can increase the plasma concentration of each 
drug, causing severe adverse events, and is thus not recommended. Those substrate drugs include the angiotensin inhibitor aliskiren, the alpha-adrenoreceptor antagonist alfuzosin, the anti-angina drug ranolazine, antiarrhythmics (amiodarone, dronedarone), 
the antiplatelet ticagrelor, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (atorvastatin, lovastatin, simvastatin), antipsychotics (luracidone, pimozide, quetiapine), the gastrointestinal motility stimulant cisapride, 
sedatives (triazolam, midazolam), and the ergot agonist ergotamine. Furthermore, serum ALT elevation frequently developed 
when ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir were administered to women using the oral contraceptive ethinylestradiol; 
thus, co-administration is not recommended. Some other drugs 
also require caution for dose modification, rescheduling of administration times, or monitoring for adverse reactions caused by 
drug–drug interactions.
Adverse reactions and safety
The most common adverse reactions observed with ombitasvir/
paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir were nausea, pruritus, and insomnia. When it is administered with ribavirin, the most commonly 
reported adverse reactions were fatigue, nausea, pruritus, other 
skin reactions, and insomnia. Hepatic decompensation and hepatic failure, including liver transplantation or fatal outcomes, 
have been reported, mostly in patients with advanced cirrhosis, 
warranting close monitoring for clinical signs and symptoms. In 
addition, ALT elevation more than 5 times the upper normal limit 
at treatment week 4 was reported in about 1% of patients; thus 
monitoring of liver enzymes is required.
Elbasvir/grazoprevir
Elbasvir is an inhibitor of HCV NS5A, and grazoprevir is an HCV 
NS3/4A protease inhibitor.
Dosage and administration
Elbasvir/grazoprevir is a fixed dose combination of elbasvir (50 
mg) and grazoprevir (100 mg) in a single tablet and should be 
orally administered at the dose of one tablet once a day with or 
without food.
Pharmacokinetics
Elbasvir and grazoprevir are partially metabolized by CYP3A4 
and are mainly eliminated through bile and feces. No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with mild hepatic impairment (CTP class A). However, the AUC of grazoprevir increases 
5-fold and 12-fold in patients with moderate and severe hepatic 
impairment (CTP class B and C), respectively. Thus, elbasvir/grazoprevir is contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (CTP class B or C). No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with any degree of renal impairment, 
including patients receiving hemodialysis.
Drug–drug interactions
Moderate or strong CYP3A inducers, including anticonvulsants 
(carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin), the 
antituberculosis drug rifampin, the herbal product St. John’s wort, 
antiretrovirals (efavirenz, etravirine), the antibiotic nafcillin, the

endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan, and the stimulant drug 
modafinil, decrease the plasma concentration of elbasvir and 
grazoprevir; thus, co-administration is contraindicated. Inhibitors 
of CYP3A or OATP1B1/3, including antiretrovirals (cobicistat-containing regimens, atazanavir, darunavir, lopinavir, saquinavir, tipranavir) and the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine, can increase the plasma concentration of elbasvir and grazoprevir and 
are thus contraindicated. Grazoprevir is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A, and elbasvir is a weak inhibitor of P-gp; therefore, the possibility that elbasvir/grazoprevir will affect the plasma levels of other 
drugs is relatively low. However, co-administration with substrate 
drugs of CYP3A or P-gp (tacrolimus, statins, dabigatran, ticagrelor) warrants caution for drug–drug interactions.
Adverse reactions and safety
The most common adverse reactions observed with elbasvir/
grazoprevir were fatigue, headache, and nausea. Serum ALT elevation more than 5 times the upper normal limit at treatment 
week 8 was reported in about 1% of patients; thus monitoring for 
liver function is required.
Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir
Glecaprevir is an HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitor, and pibrentasvir is an HCV NS5A inhibitor.
Dosage and administration
Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir is a fixed dose combination of glecaprevir (100 mg) and pibrentasvir (40 mg) in a single tablet and 
should be orally administered at the dose of three tablets once a 
day with food.
Pharmacokinetics
Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir is metabolized by CYP3A and mainly 
eliminated in bile, with less than 1% excreted in urine. The AUC 
of glecaprevir is 2-fold higher in patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment (CTP class B) compared to normal subjects, and the 
AUC of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir is 11-fold and 2-fold higher, 
respectively, in patients with severe hepatic impairment (CTP class 
C). Therefore, glecaprevir/pibrentasvir is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (CTP class C) and is also 
not recommended in patients with moderate hepatic impairment 
(CTP class B). No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients 
with any degree of renal impairment, including patients receiving 
hemodialysis.
Drug–drug interactions
Strong or moderate inducers of P-gp and CYP significantly reduce the AUC of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir with loss of therapeutic 
efficacy. Thus, anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, 
phenobarbital, phenytoin), antituberculosis drugs (rifampin, rifapentine, rifabutin), the herbal product St. John’s wort, the antiretroviral efavirenz, and the endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan 
are contraindicated. Glecaprevir and pibrentasvir are substrates of 
P-gp and BCRP, and glecaprevir is a substrate of OATP 1B1/3. Because P-gp, BCRP, and OATP 1B1/3 inhibitors increase the AUC of 
glecaprevir and pibrentasvir, antiretrovirals (atazanavir, darunavir, 
lopinavir, ritonavir) are contraindicated, and co-administration 
with cyclosporine at a dose above 100 mg per day is not recommended.
Glecaprevir and pibrentasvir are inhibitors of P-gp, BCRP, and 
OATP 1B1/3 and can increase the plasma concentrations of drugs 
that are substrates of those transporters. The angiotensin inhibitor aliskiren, the anticoagulant dabigatran, and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (atorvastatin, lovastatin, simvastatin) are contraindicated. Co-administration with other HMG-CoA reductase 
inhibitors (fluvastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin), the 
antiarrhythmic digoxin, or immunosuppressive drugs (everolimus, 
sirolimus, tacrolimus) can increase the plasma concentration of 
each drug, warranting dose adjustment or monitoring for adverse 
reactions. Furthermore, serum ALT elevations frequently developed when glecaprevir/pibrentasvir was administered to women 
using the oral contraceptive ethinylestradiol; thus, glecaprevir/pibrentasvir is not recommended in that condition. 
Adverse reactions and safety
The most common adverse reactions observed with glecaprevir/
pibrentasvir were headache and fatigue.
Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir
Velpatasvir is an HCV NS5A inhibitor, and sofosbuvir is an HCV 
NS5B polymerase inhibitor.
Dosage and administration
Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir is a fixed dose combination of sofosbuvir 
(400 mg) and velpatasvir (100 mg) in a single tablet and should 
be orally administered at the dose of one tablet once a day with 
or without food.

180 http://www.e-cmh.org
Clin Mol Hepatol
Volume_24 Number_3 September 2018
https://doi.org/10.3350/cmh.2018.1004
Pharmacokinetics
Velpatasvir is metabolized by CYP2B6, CYP2C8, and CYP3A4 
and mainly excreted via bile. The AUC of velpatasvir in patients 
with moderate or severe hepatic impairment is similar to that in 
subjects with normal hepatic function. Thus, no dosage adjustment is required for patients with cirrhosis, including decompensated disease. No dosage adjustment is required for patients with 
mild or moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30–80 mL/min), but it 
is not recommended for use in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min) or ESRD requiring dialysis because the 
AUC of GS-331007, a metabolite of sofosbuvir, is significantly increased.
Drug–drug interactions
Strong or moderate inducers of P-gp, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, or CYP3A4 decrease the plasma concentration of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir with loss of therapeutic efficacy. Thus, anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin), 
antituberculosis drugs (rifampin, rifapentine, rifabutin), the herbal 
product St. John’s wort, the antiretroviral efavirenz, the stimulant 
modafinil, and the endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan are 
contraindicated. Because drugs increasing gastric pH reduce the 
solubility of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, caution is needed when antacids, an H2 receptor antagonist, or a proton pump inhibitor is coadministered.
Velpatasvir is an inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1/B3, and 
OATP2B1. Co-administration of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir with substrates of those transporters can increase the plasma concentration of each drug. Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir increases the plasma 
concentration of topotecan, an anticancer drug; thus, co-administration is not recommended. Co-administration with tenofovircontaining regimens of antiretrovirals or HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin) can increase the plasma levels 
of each drug, requiring dose adjustment or monitoring for adverse 
reactions. Co-administration of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir with amiodarone is contraindicated due to a risk of serious bradycardia. Frequent monitoring for digoxin levels is recommended if it is used.
Adverse reactions and safety
The most common adverse reactions observed with sofosbuvir/
velpatasvir were headache and fatigue. When it is administered 
with ribavirin, the most commonly reported adverse reactions 
were fatigue, anemia, nausea, headache, insomnia, and diarrhea.
Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir
Voxilaprevir is an HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitor, velpatasvir is 
an HCV NS5A inhibitor, and sofosbuvir is an HCV NS5B polymerase inhibitor.
Dosage and administration
Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir is a fixed dose combination 
of sofosbuvir (400 mg), velpatasvir (100 mg), and voxilaprevir (100 
mg) in a single tablet and should be orally administered at the 
dose of one tablet once a day with food.
Pharmacokinetics
Voxilaprevir is metabolized by CYP3A4 and mainly eliminated 
via bile. Compared to subjects with normal hepatic function, the 
AUC of voxilaprevir is 1.7-fold higher in patients with mild hepatic 
impairment (CTP class A) and 3-fold and 5-fold higher, respectively, in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment 
(CTP class B and C). Therefore, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir 
is contraindicated in decompensated cirrhotic patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (CTP class B or C). No dose 
adjustment is required for patients with mild or moderate renal 
impairment (eGFR 30–80 mL/min), but it is not recommended for 
use in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min) 
or ESRD requiring dialysis because the AUC of GS-331007 is significantly increased.
Drug–drug interactions
Sofosbuvir, velpatasvir, and voxilaprevir are substrates of P-gp 
and BCRP, and voxilaprevir is a substrate of OATP1B1/1B3. Strong 
or moderate P-gp, CYP inducers significantly decrease the AUC of 
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir with loss of therapeutic efficacy. Thus, anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin), antituberculosis drugs (rifampin, rifapentine, 
rifabutin), the herbal product St. John’s wort, the antiretroviral 
efavirenz, and the endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan are 
contraindicated. OATP inhibitors can markedly increase the plasma concentration of voxilaprevir; thus, antiretrovirals (atazanavir, 
lopinavir) and the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine are contraindicated. Because drugs increasing gastric pH reduce the solubility of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir, caution is warranted 
when antacids, an H2 receptor antagonist, or a proton pump inhibitor are co-administered.
Velpatasvir and voxilaprevir are inhibitors of P-gp, BCRP, and 
OATP 1B1/1B3, and velpatasvir is an inhibitor of OATP 2B1. There-

fore, co-administration with drugs that are substrates of those 
transporters can change the plasma levels of each drug. HMGCoA reductase inhibitors (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, 
pitavastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin), anticancer drugs (methotrexate, mitoxantrone, imatinib, irinotecan, lapatinib, topotecan), 
and the anticoagulant dabigatran are contraindicated. Co-administration of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir with amiodarone 
can cause serious bradycardia and is thus contraindicated. Frequent monitoring for digoxin levels is required when it is used. 
Co-administration with a tenofovir-containing regimen of antiretrovirals or lipid lowering drugs (ezetimibe, pravastatin) can increase the plasma levels of each drug, requiring dose adjustment 
or monitoring for adverse reactions. Furthermore, serum ALT elevations frequently developed when sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir was administered to women using the oral contraceptive 
ethinylestradiol; thus, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir is contraindicated in that condition.
Adverse reactions and safety
The most common adverse reactions observed with sofosbuvir/
velpatasvir/voxilaprevir were headache, fatigue, diarrhea, and 
nausea.
HCV resistance-associated substitution (RAS) testing
While a variety of DAAs were being tested, amino acid sequence substitutions associated with resistance to DAAs were 
found (Table 5).9
 Thus, some DAAs require RAS testing before 
treatment. 
HCV RASs can appear spontaneously during the HCV life cycle 
without previous DAA therapy. The frequency of naturally occurring RASs varies among genotypes: for an NS3 RAS, it is 75.0% 
and 2.0% in genotypes 1a and 1b, respectively; for an NS5A RAS, 
it is 3.5% and 14.1% in genotypes 1a and 1b, respectively.10 In 
contrast, the frequency of naturally occurring NS5B RASs is very 
low: in phase 2 and 3 clinical trials of sofosbuvir (n=8,598), 
S282T was not detected when measured by the deep sequencing 
method (with 1% cutoff).11 Viruses resistant to NS3 protease inhibitors or NS5B inhibitors disappear from peripheral blood within 
a few weeks to months, whereas NS5A inhibitor-resistant viruses 
persist for years.9
There are several RAS testing methods: population sequencing, 
clonal sequencing, and deep sequencing. The sensitivity of each 
method is 10–25%, 5%, and 0.5-1%, respectively. Resistant viruses present in low proportions (less than 15%) at baseline do 
not appear to significantly influence the treatment response. Also, 
a 15% cutoff better predicts treatment failure through the selection of resistant viruses. Thus, a 15% cutoff is widely recommendTable 5. Lists of reported RASs in genotype 1 HCV

ed to report the presence of RASs.9 However, RAS testing methods are not yet well standardized, and HCV RAS testing prior to 
DAA therapy is not generally required in clinical practice.
Exceptionally, several conditions do necessitate RAS testing prior to DAA therapy. For example, in HCV genotype 1b-infected patients with a baseline NS5A RAS at position L31 or Y93, daclatasvir and asunaprevir combination therapy showed a significantly 
lower SVR than in those without NS5A RASs.12 Therefore, NS5A 
RAS testing should be performed prior to daclatasvir and asunaprevir combination therapy. If NS5A RASs are detected, an alternative regimen should be considered. In HCV genotype 1a-infected patients with a baseline NS5A RAS at position M28, Q30, L31, 
or Y93, elbasvir/grazoprevir treatment had a significantly lower 
SVR than in those without RASs.13 Therefore, HCV genotype 1ainfected patients should be tested for NS5A RASs prior to elbasvir/
grazoprevir treatment. If NS5A RASs are detected, the prolongation of treatment duration and the addition of ribavirin should be 
considered. In addition, RAS testing could help clinicians choose 
the best drugs for patients who failed with initial DAA therapy. 
When the HCV titer is very low in serum or a mutation is at the 
position where the primer binds, a RAS test can be “undetermined.” In that case, it is reasonable to regard it as RAS-positive 
and treat accordingly.
[Recommendations]
1. Patients with HC V genot ype 1b chronic hepatitis C or 
compensated cirrhosis should be tested for NS5A RASs prior to 
daclatasvir and asunaprevir combination treatment. If NS5A RASs 
are detected, an alternative regimen should be considered (A1).
2. Patients with HCV genotype 1a chronic hepatitis C or compensated 
cirrhosis should be tested for NS5A RASs prior to elbasvir/
grazoprevir treatment. If NS5A RASs are detected, prolonging the 
treatment duration and adding ribavirin should be considered 
(A1).
TREATMENT OF CHRONIC HEPATITIS C OR
COMPENSATED CIRRHOSIS PATIENTS
Treatment of chronic hepatitis C or compensated 
cirrhosis patients with HCV genotype 1 infection
Several potent DAA oral combination regimens are recommended for patients with genotype 1 infection. However, the regimens 
differ based on the HCV subtype, the existence of baseline RASs, 
and liver cirrhosis status. Some regimens have demonstrated 
higher treatment failure rates in genotype 1a patients. Therefore, 
genotype 1 patients whose subtype cannot be identified should 
be treated as if they had a genotype 1a infection. 
Few Korean HCV patients have been treated with 1st generation protease inhibitors (PIs) such as boceprevir or telaprevir, except those enrolled in clinical trials. In these guidelines, “treatment-experienced patients” refer to people treated with 
interferon-based treatments (pegylated or conventional) with or 
without ribavirin. Those patients might have failed to achieve an 
SVR for various reasons, including non-response to the treatment 
or intolerance to or ineligibility for the interferon-based treatment. 
Initial treatment of genotype 1b patients
Ledipasvir/sofosbuvir: In a phase 3, open-label study involving previously untreated patients with chronic HCV genotype 1 
infection (n=865, genotype 1b 33%, cirrhosis 16%), the SVR following 12 weeks of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir treatment was 99% 
(211/214).14 The addition of ribavirin or treatment extension to 24 
weeks did not affect the outcome. In addition, an integrated safety and efficacy analysis of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in previously untreated patients with genotype 1 HCV infection and compensated 
cirrhosis (n=161) concluded that the addition of ribavirin or extension of treatment duration did not affect the SVR in those patients 
either.13
In a phase 3, open-label study involving 647 previously untreated patients with HCV genotype 1 infection without cirrhosis, the 
SVR were similar among those who received 8 weeks of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir treatment (94%, 202/215), 8 weeks of ledipasvir/
sofosbuvir plus ribavirin (93%, 201/216), and 12 weeks of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir treatment (95%, 206/216).15 In that study, the 
degree of fibrosis was assessed by liver biopsy, and cirrhotic patients were excluded. Virologic relapse rates were higher in the 
8-week arms with or without ribavirin than in the 12-week treatment group (5% [20/431] vs. 1% [3/216]). Post hoc analyses assessed baseline predictors of relapse and identified lower relapse 
rates in patients receiving 8 weeks of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir who 
had baseline HCV RNA levels of less than 6,000,000 IU/mL 
(2/123; 2%). In another cohort study, SVRs in patients receiving 8 
weeks of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir were not inferior to those in the 
12-week treatment group if the patients were non-cirrhotic and 
had baseline HCV RNA of less than 6,000,000 IU/mL, providing 
the possibility of shortening therapy for some patients.16 In a recent observational study involving HCV genotype 1b infected patients without cirrhosis, the SVR rate in the 8-week ledipasvir/so-

fosbuvir treatment group (97%, 62/64) was similar to that in the 
12 week-treatment group (97%, 61/63) (cirrhotic patients were 
excluded based on clinical evidence and results from at least two 
imaging tools, i.e., abdominal ultrasonography, FibroScan®
, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging).17 On the other hand, another observational cohort study found that treatmentnaïve patients with HCV genotype 1 without cirrhosis (FIB-4≤3.25 
or APRI ≤2) and baseline HCV RNA of less than 6,000,000 IU/mL 
who completed 8 weeks of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir treatment had an 
SVR of 93% (1,020/1,094), whereas those who completed 12 
weeks of therapy showed an SVR of 97% (875/906).18 However, 
that study assessed cirrhosis using laboratory markers, FIB-4 or 
APRI, so the possibility that patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis were recruited cannot be excluded. In another study, in 
which fibrosis stage was assessed by transient elastography, serum biomarkers (fibro-SURE, Hepascore), or liver biopsy, the SVR 
of treatment-naïve, HCV genotype 1b infected patients without 
cirrhosis treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir was 99% (200/202).19
In addition, a meta-analysis of six additional cohorts comprising 
5,637 patients demonstrated comparable relapse rates after 
8-week and 12-week treatments of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (relative 
risk [RR] 0.99, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.98–1.00).19
In treatment-naïve HCV genotype 1b infected patients, the 
presence of baseline NS5A RASs did not affect the treatment outcome after ledipasvir/sofosbuvir treatment, which provided an 
SVR of 99% in every group, including those with liver cirrhosis.20
However, in a recent cohort study (n=772, treatment naïve 61%), 
NS5A RASs undermined the virological response in HCV genotype 
1b infected patients with cirrhosis.21 In that study, the SVR12 in 
cirrhotic patients with NS5A RASs (88%, 49/56) was statistically 
lower than the SVR12 in the other three groups: non-cirrhosis 
without NS5A RASs (100%, 405/405), non-cirrhosis with NS5A 
RASs (99%, 125/126), and cirrhosis without NS5A RASs (99%, 
154/155). Although, the researchers did not analyze the SVR according to treatment experience, those findings suggest that 
baseline RASs could affect treatment outcomes in genotype 1b 
cirrhotic patients. 
Elbasvir/grazoprevir: In a phase 3 study, treatment-naïve 
HCV genotype 1b infected patients were treated with elbasvir/
grazoprevir for 12 weeks and showed an SVR of 99% (129/131).13
The presence of compensated cirrhosis did not affect the SVR 
rates.13 The SVR in patients with and without baseline RASs was 
94% (17/18), and 100% (112/112), respectively. In another phase 
3 study, patients infected with HCV genotype 1 or 4 were treated 
with elbasvir/grazoprevir for 12 weeks (genotype 1b 85%, PR experience 22%) and showed an SVR rate of 99% (128/129).22 In 
that study, HCV genotype 1b infected patients with baseline RASs 
had an SVR of 100% (11/11).22 In a study conducted in Japan, the 
SVR after patients with genotype 1b infection with and without 
cirrhosis received a 12-week treatment of elbasvir/grazoprevir was 
97% (34/35) and 97% (219/227), respectively.23 In a pooled analysis, HCV genotype 1b patients with baseline NS5A RASs who received 12 weeks of elbasvir/grazoprevir had an SVR of 94% 
(48/51), and those without baseline RASs had an SVR of 99% 
(247/248) (P=0.017).24
Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir plus dasabuvir: Treatment-naïve HCV genotype 1b infected patients without liver cirrhosis who received ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir plus dasabuvir combined with ribavirin for 12 weeks showed an SVR of 99% 
(209/210), and those who did not receive the ribavirin combination had an SVR of 99% (207/209).25 In another study of patients 
with genotype 1b infection without cirrhosis, the SVR after 12 
weeks of therapy with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir with and without ribavirin was 99% (83/84) and 98% 
(81/83), respectively.26 In another study, treatment-naïve genotype 1b infected patients without liver cirrhosis treated with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir plus dasabuvir and ribavirin showed 
an SVR of 100% (22/22),27 as did treatment-naïve genotype 1b 
patients without cirrhosis in a different study who were treated 
ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir plus dasabuvir without ribavirin 
SVR of 100% (60/60).28
Daclatasvir and sofosbuvir: In a study of 101 patients with 
HIV/HCV co-infection treated with daclatasvir and sofosbuvir, a 
post hoc analysis showed that treatment-naïve patients with genotype 1b infection without cirrhosis who were treated for 12 
weeks showed an SVR of 100% (12/12).29,30 In a study of treatment-naïve patients with genotype 1 infection, the SVR after 24 
weeks of treatment with daclatasvir and sofosbuvir was 100% 
(29/29), regardless of ribavirin combination, and the SVR after 12 
weeks of therapy with daclatasvir and sofosbuvir with and without ribavirin was 95% (39/41) and 100% (41/41), respectively.31
That study included only 11 patients with cirrhosis, making it inappropriate for evaluating the influence of cirrhosis on SVR.31 A 
cohort study that recruited 768 genotype 1 infected patients (liver 
cirrhosis 73%, genotype 1b 46%, treatment naïve 16%) assessed 
SVR according to the treatment duration (12 weeks vs. 24 weeks 
of daclatasvir plus sofosbuvir) with and without ribavirin. In cirrhotic patients, the SVR rates after 12-week, 12-week+ribavirin, 
24-week, and 24-week+ribavirin treatments were 87% (82/94), 
92% (23/25), 94% (323/343), and 98% (100/102), respectively

(P=0.0152). That study suggests that cirrhosis status and treatment experience influence SVR.32 In a phase 3 study that treated 
patients with genotype 1b infection and decompensated cirrhosis 
with daclatasvir and sofosbuvir for 12 weeks in combination with 
ribavirin, the SVR was 100% (11/11).33
Daclatasvir and asunaprevir: Daclatasvir and asunaprevir 
treatment for 24 weeks in 203 treatment-naïve genotype 1b patients produced an SVR of 90%.12 The SVRs did not differ by the 
baseline factors of gender, age, race, IL28B genotype, or cirrhosis 
status. However, the presence of baseline NS5A RASs (L31 or 
Y93) significantly reduced the SVR. A pooled data analysis from 5 
phase 2 and 3 studies (n=979, treatment naïve 30%, liver cirrhosis 22%) demonstrated an SVR of 39% in patients with NS5A 
RASs compared to an SVR rate of 94% in patients without RASs 
after 24 weeks of daclatasvir and asunaprevir treatment.34 Baseline NS5A RASs were identified in 13–14% of the patients included in this analysis. A post hoc analysis of a phase 3 clinical study 
investigated the efficacy of 24 weeks of asunaprevir and daclatasvir treatment in Asian genotype 1b patients (n=747, including 78 
Koreans). The SVR was 92% among treatment-naïve patients. 
SVR12 varied little according to the baseline factors of age, viral 
load, IL28 genotype, and cirrhosis status.35 A multivariate regression analysis showed that NS5A RAS had a significant influence 
on SVR (odds ratio [OR] 19.64, 95% CI 4.72–81.75).
Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir: In a phase 2 study, DAA-naïve 
noncirrhotic patients with HCV genotype 1 infection treated with 
glecaprevir (200 mg) plus pibrentasvir (120 mg) for 12 weeks, glecaprevir (200 mg) plus pibrentasvir (40 mg) for 12 weeks, or glecaprevir (300 mg) plus pibrentasvir (120 mg) for 8 weeks showed 
SVRs of 100%, 97%, and 97%, respectively (n=133, treatment 
experience 30%).36 A phase 3 study that assessed the efficacy 
and safety of 8 and 12 weeks of glecaprevir (300 mg)/pibrentasvir 
(120 mg) in HCV genotype 1 monoinfected and HIV/HCV co-infected patients without cirrhosis (n=703, interferon-based treatment experience 28%, sofosbuvir-based treatment experience 
0.4%, genotype 1a 43%) showed SVR of 99% and 99.7%, respectively.37 In a pooled analysis of phase 2 and 3 studies of patients with genotype 1–6 chronic HCV infection without cirrhosis 
(interferon-based treatment experience 23%, sofosbuvir-based 
treatment experience 1%), the SVR rates among patients with 
genotype 1 infection (n=788, genotype 1b 56%) after 8 or 12 
weeks of treatment with glecaprevir (300 mg) and pibrentasvir 
(120 mg) were 99% and 100%, respectively.38
A phase 2 study among DAA-naïve HCV genotype 1 infected 
patients with compensated cirrhosis (n=27, genotype 1b 26%, interferon-based treatment experience 22%) treated with glecaprevir (200 mg) plus pibrentasvir (120 mg) for 12 weeks showed an 
SVR of 96%.39
A phase 3 study of HCV genotype 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 infected patients with compensated cirrhosis (n=146, interferon-based treatment experience 17%, sofosbuvir-based treatment experience 
8%) treated with glecaprevir (300 mg)/pibrentasvir (120 mg) for 
12 weeks showed an SVR of 100% in patients with genotype 1b 
infection (n=39).40
A phase 3 study conducted in Japan among DAA-naive HCV 
genotype 1 infected patients without cirrhosis (n=129, genotype 
1b 97%, treatment experience 27%) treated with glecaprevir (300 
mg)/pibrentasvir (120 mg) for 8 weeks found an SVR of 99%.41
On the other hand, treatment-naive HCV genotype 1 infected patients with cirrhosis (n=38, genotype 1b 100%, treatment experience 32%) were treated with glecaprevir (300 mg)/pibrentasvir 
(120 mg) for 12 weeks and showed an SVR of 100%.41
Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir: In a phase 3, double-blind, placebocontrolled study among untreated and previously treated HCV 
genotype 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 infected patients (including 20% cirrhotic patients), the SVR of HCV genotype 1b infected patients 
following 12 weeks of treatment with sofosbuvir (400 mg)/velpatasvir (100 mg) was 99% (117/118).42 The SVR was 100% (94/94) 
in patients without cirrhosis and 96% (23/24) in compensated cirrhotic patients. In that study, the SVR of treatment-naïve HCV 
genotype 1b infected patients was 100% (86/86).
Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir: In a phase 3, openlabel trial, HCV infected patients who had not been previously 
treated with DAAs were randomly assigned to groups given sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir for 8 weeks or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 weeks (n=941, conventional or pegylated interferon 
experienced patients 23%).43 The overall SVR rate following treatment with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir for 8 weeks or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 weeks was 95% (476/501) and 98% 
(432/440), respectively. Although the 8-week treatment of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir seems to be inferior to the 12-week 
treatment of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, the HCV genotype 1b infected 
patients treated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir for 8 
weeks had an SVR of 97% (61/63), and those treated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 weeks also had an SVR of 97% (57/59). 
On the other hand, the HCV genotype 1a infected patients treated 
for 8 weeks had an SVR of only 92% (155/169), whereas those 
treated for 12 weeks had an SVR of 99% (170/172). The SVRs following an 8-week treatment of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir 
or 12-week treatment of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir were 96%

(395/411) and 98% (349/356), respectively, in non-cirrhotic patients and 91% (82/90) and 99% (83/84) in cirrhotic patients. In 
HCV genotype 1b infected patients, virologic relapse rates were 
3% (2/63) after an 8-week treatment of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/
voxilaprevir and 2% (1/59) after a 12-week treatment of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir. Baseline NS3 or NS5A RASs were found in 50% 
(250/501) of patients in the 8-week sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir treatment group, and those patients had an SVR of 94% 
(234/250). On the other hand, baseline NS3 or NS5A RASs were 
found in 50% (220/440) of the patients in the sofosbuvir/velpatasvir 12-week treatment group, and their SVR was 99% 
(217/220).
Re-treatment of treatment-experienced patients with 
genotype 1b 
Ledipasvir/sofosbuvir: In a phase 3, randomized, open-label 
study among previously treated chronic HCV genotype 1 infected 
patients (n=440, genotype 1b 21%, cirrhosis 20%, protease inhibitor-experienced patients 53%), 12 weeks of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, 12 weeks of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir plus ribavirin, 24 weeks 
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, and 24 weeks of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir plus 
ribavirin provided SVR rates of 87% (20/23), 100% (23/23), 
100% (24/24), and 100% (23/23), respectively.44 Baseline viral 
load, age, IL28B genotype, and sub-genotype had no significant 
effects on treatment response. In this study, among HCV genotype 1 infected patients with compensated cirrhosis, 12 weeks of 
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir treatment, 12 weeks of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir 
plus ribavirin treatment, 24 weeks of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir treatment, and 24 weeks of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir plus ribavirin treatment provided SVR rates of 86% (19/22), 82% (18/22), 95% 
(21/22), and 100% (22/22), respectively (P=0.007). In another 
study where treatment-experienced HCV genotype 1 infected patients with compensated cirrhosis that were enrolled in phase 2 or 
3 clinical trials were analyzed (n=352, genotype 1b 37%), 12 
weeks of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir treatment, 12 weeks ledipasvir/sofosbuvir plus ribavirin treatment, 24 weeks of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir treatment, and 24 weeks of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir plus ribavirin 
treatment provided SVR rates of 90% (64/71), 96% (152/159), 
98% (98/100), and 100% (22/22), respectively, showing that the 
addition of ribavirin and extended treatment duration improved 
the virologic response.13 On the other hand, in a study involving 
PI-experienced cirrhotic patients (n=155, genotype 1b 55%), the 
SVR of the 12-week ledipasvir/sofosbuvir plus ribavirin treatment 
group (96%, 74/77) was similar to that of the 24-week ledipasvir/
sofosbuvir plus ribavirin treatment group (97%, 75/77).45 However, a phase 3 Japanese study (n=341, genotype 1b 97%, cirrhosis 
22%, treatment experience 51%) found that patients treated for 
12 weeks with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir without ribavirin and those 
treated for 12 weeks with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir plus ribavirin 
showed SVR rates of 100% (171/171) and 98% (167/170), respectively.46 Therefore, HCV genotype 1b infected patients treated 
with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir without ribavirin for 12 weeks showed 
a high SVR irrespective of their treatment experience or cirrhosis 
status. In a phase 3 Korean study, treatment-experienced, HCV 
genotype 1 infected patients (n=47, genotype 1b 98%, cirrhosis 
28%) treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 12 weeks showed an 
SVR of 98% (46/47).47
It has been recognized that the presence of NS5A RASs might 
not affect the SVRs in genotype 1b patients.46,48 However, a recent study reported that the presence of NS5A RASs did affect 
the SVR in genotype 1b patients21 and a study reported that 
among treatment-experienced patients. the SVR was 89% (41/46) 
in NS5A RAS-positive patients and 98% (267/272) in NS5A RASnegative patients.20
Elbasvir/grazoprevir: In a phase 3 study, treatment-experienced genotype 1 infected patients (genotype 1b 35%, liver cirrhosis 35%) treated with elbasvir/grazoprevir without ribavirin for 
12 weeks had an SVR of 100% (34/34), and those treated with 
elbasvir/grazoprevir plus ribavirin for 12 weeks had an SVR of 
97% (28/29), whereas those treated with elbasvir/grazoprevir 
without ribavirin for 16 weeks had an SVR of 100% (36/36), and 
those treated for 16 weeks with elbasvir/grazoprevir plus ribavirin 
had an SVR of 98% (46/47).49 The presence of baseline NS5A 
RASs did not affect the SVRs in patients with genotype 1b infection treated with 12 weeks of elbasvir/grazoprevir.49 In a pooled 
analysis, HCV genotype 1b patients with baseline NS5A RASs 
treated with 12 weeks of elbasvir/grazoprevir had an SVR of 94% 
(48/51), and those without baseline RASs had an SVR of 99% 
(247/248) (P=0.017).24
Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir plus dasabuvir: In 
treatment-experienced patients with genotype 1b infection without cirrhosis, the SVR after a 12-week treatment with ombitasvir/
paritaprevir/ritonavir plus dasabuvir with ribavirin was 97% 
(119/123).50 In another study of treatment-experienced patients 
with genotype 1b infection, the SVR after a 12-week treatment of 
ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir plus dasabuvir with and without 
ribavirin was 97% (85/88) and 97% (85/88), respectively. The addition of ribavirin was thus not beneficial in treatment-experienced genotype 1b infected patients.51 In a phase 3 study of 380 
patients with genotype 1 infection and cirrhosis (treatment expe-

rience 58%, genotype 1b 31%), the SVR of genotype 1b infected 
patients treated with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir plus dasabuvir with ribavirin for 12 or 24 weeks was 99% (67/68) and 
100% (51/51), respectively.27 In another study of 60 genotype 1b 
infected patients with cirrhosis (treatment experience 55%), the 
SVR of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir plus dasabuvir treatment 
for 12 weeks was 100% (60/60).28
Daclatasvir and sofosbuvir: In a study of treatment-experienced patients with HIV/HCV co-infection, genotype 1b infected 
patients treated with daclatasvir and sofosbuvir for 12 weeks 
showed an SVR of 98% (43/44).30 That study included 15 patients 
with cirrhosis whose subtypes were not analyzed.30 In a phase 2 
study of 41 treatment-experienced patients with genotype 1 infection (genotype 1b 24%, cirrhosis 14%), the SVR from a 24-
week treatment of daclatasvir and sofosbuvir with and without 
ribavirin were 100% (21/21) and 95% (19/20), respectively.31 A 
cohort study of 768 genotype 1 infected patients (liver cirrhosis 
73%, genotype 1b 46%, treatment experience 84%) assessed 
SVR by treatment duration (12 weeks vs. 24 weeks of daclatasvir 
and sofosbuvir) with and without ribavirin. In cirrhotic patients, 
the SVR following 12 weeks, 12 weeks+ribavirin, 24 weeks, and 
24 weeks+ribavirin was 87% (82/94), 92% (23/25), 94% 
(323/343), and 98% (100/102), respectively.32 That study revealed 
that cirrhosis and treatment experience influenced SVR.32 A phase 
3 study treated patients with genotype 1b infection and decompensated cirrhosis with daclatasvir and sofosbuvir for 12 weeks in 
combination with ribavirin and found an SVR of 100% (11/11).33
Daclatasvir and asunaprevir: A phase 3 study that evaluated the efficacy of 24 weeks of treatment with daclatasvir and 
asunaprevir in previous non-responders to peginterferon alpha 
plus ribavirin and those ineligible for or intolerant to peginterferon 
alpha plus ribavirin demonstrated an SVR of 82% (168/205) and 
82% (192/235), respectively, whereas the SVR in treatment-naïve 
patients following the same protocol was 90% (182/203).12 A post 
hoc analysis of that study to determine the efficacy of that treatment in Korean patients (n=44) showed an SVR of 70% (16/23) 
in non-responders and 86% (15/21) in patients ineligible for or intolerant to peginterferon-based treatment.35 The presence of 
NS5A RASs appeared to be the single most important predictor of 
treatment failure in that study. Another phase 3 study conducted 
in Japan among 87 non-responders and 135 patients ineligible for 
or intolerant to peginterferon-based treatment received daclatasvir and asunaprevir treatment for 24 weeks and provided an overall SVR of 85% (188/222).52 In that study, non-responders showed 
an SVR of 81% (70/87), and patients ineligible for or intolerant to 
peginterferon-based treatment had an SVR of 87% (118/135). 
Baseline cirrhosis status had no effect on SVR, and baseline NS5A 
RASs were not tested in that study. A meta-analysis of 9 trials 
(n=1690) that provide 24 week treatment of asunaprevir and daclatasvir showed an SVR of 90% (336/374) in treatment-naïve patients and 82% (316/386) and 85% (514/607) in non-responders 
and patients ineligible for or intolerant to peginterferon-based 
treatments, respectively.53 However, that study did not analyze 
the presence of baseline NS5A RASs, so enrolled patients might 
have had baseline NS5A RASs. Recently, Korean genotype 1b patients without baseline NS5A RASs (treatment experience 25%, 
cirrhosis 29%) were treated with daclatasvir and asunaprevir for 
24 weeks. The patients without liver cirrhosis had an SVR of 98% 
(102/104), and those with compensated liver cirrhosis had an SVR 
of 92% (44/48) (P=0.080).54 Asunaprevir and daclatasvir were 
given for 24 weeks in Korean genotype 1b patients without baseline NS5A RASs (n=251, treatment experience 36%, cirrhosis 
22%) and provided an overall SVR of 98% (246/251), whereas 
patients with liver cirrhosis showed an SVR of 96% (49/51).55
Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir: In a phase 2 study recruiting 
DAA-naïve genotype 1–6 infected patients without cirrhosis, 
genotype 1 infected patients (n=133, treatment experience 30%) 
treated with glecaprevir (200 mg) plus pibrentasvir (120 mg) for 
12 weeks, glecaprevir (200 mg) plus pibrentasvir (40 mg) for 12 
weeks, or glecaprevir (300 mg) plus pibrentasvir (120 mg) for 8 
weeks showed SVR rates of 100%, 97%, and 97%, respectively.36
In a phase 3 study that assessed the efficacy and safety of 8 or 12 
weeks of glecaprevir (300 mg)/pibrentasvir (120 mg) in genotype 
1 mono-infected or HIV/HCV co-infected patients without cirrhosis (n=703, interferon-based treatment experience 28%, sofosbuvir-based treatment experience 0.4%, genotype 1a 43%), the 
SVRs were 99% and 99.7%, respectively.37 In a pooled analysis of 
phase 2 and 3 studies of genotype 1–6 HCV infected patients 
without cirrhosis (interferon-based treatment experience 23%, 
sofosbuvir-based treatment experience 1%), HCV genotype 1 infected patients (n=788, genotype 1b 56%) treated with glecaprevir (300 mg) and pibrentasvir (120 mg) for 8 or 12 weeks had 
SVRs of 99% and 100%, respectively.38
In a phase 2 study recruiting DAA-naïve genotype 1 infected 
patients with compensated cirrhosis (n=27, genotype 1b 26%, interferon-based treatment experience 22%), the SVR rate after 12 
weeks of glecaprevir (200 mg) plus pibrentasvir (120 mg) was 
96%.39 In a phase 3 study that assessed the efficacy and safety of 
12 weeks of glecaprevir (300 mg)/pibrentasvir (120 mg) in genotype 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 HCV patients with compensated cirrhosis

(n=146, interferon-based treatment experience 17%, sofosbuvirbased treatment experience 8%), genotype 1b infected patients 
(n=39) had an SVR of 100%.40
In a phase 3 study conducted in Japan among DAA-naive genotype 1 infected patients, patients without cirrhosis (n=129, genotype 1b 97%, treatment experience 27%) were treated with glecaprevir (300 mg)/pibrentasvir (120 mg) for 8 weeks and showed 
an SVR of 99%, whereas those with cirrhosis (n=38, genotype 1b 
100%, treatment experience 32%) were treated with glecaprevir 
(300 mg)/pibrentasvir (120 mg) for 12 weeks and showed an SVR 
of 100%.41
Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir: Treatment-experienced HCV genotype 1 infected patients were treated with sofosbuvir plus velpatasvir (25 mg or 100 mg) with or without ribavirin for 12 weeks.In 
this study, HCV genotype 1 patients treated with sofosvuvir plus 
velpatasvir (100 mg) with or without ribavirn showed SVRs of 
100% (27/27) and 96% (27/28), respectively.56
In a phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving 
untreated and previously treated HCV genotype 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6 infected patients with or without compensated cirrhosis, previously 
treated HCV genotype 1b patients treated with sofosbuvir (400 
mg)/velpatasvir (100 mg) for 12 weeks showed an SVR of 97% 
(31/32).42
Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir: In a phase 3, openlabel trial, HCV infected patients who had not previously been 
treated with a DAA were randomly assigned to groups given 8 
weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir treatment or 12 
weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir treatment (n=941, conventional 
or pegylated interferon experience 23%).43 The overall SVR in the 
8-week sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir group and 12-week sofosbuvir/velpatasvir group was 95% (476/501) and 98% 
(432/440), respectively. Although the 8-week treatment of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir seems to be inferior to the 12-week 
treatment of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, the HCV genotype 1b infected 
patients treated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir for 8 
weeks had an SVR of 97% (61/63), and those treated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 weeks also showed an SVR of 97% 
(57/59). On the other hand, HCV genotype 1a infected patients 
treated for 8 weeks had an SVR of only 92% (155/169), and those 
treated for 12 weeks had an SVR of 99% (170/172). The SVR rates 
following the 8-week treatment of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir and 12-week treatment of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir were 96% 
(395/411) and 98% (349/356), respectively, in non-cirrhotic patients, and 91% (82/90) and 99% (83/84) in cirrhotic patients. In 
HCV genotype 1b infected patients, virologic relapse rates were 
3% (2/63) after the 8-week treatment of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/
voxilaprevir and 2% (1/59) after the 12-week treatment of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir.

Initial treatment of HCV genotype 1a patients
Ledipasvir/sofosbuvir
In a phase 3, open-label study recruiting previously untreated 
HCV genotype 1 infected patients (n=865, genotype 1a 67%, cirrhosis 16%), the SVR after a 12-week treatment with ledipasvir/
sofosbuvir, 12-week treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir plus ribavirin, 24-week treatment of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, and 24-week 
treatment of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir plus ribavirin were 99% 
(211/214), 97% (211/217), 98% (212/217), and 99% (215/217), 
respectively.14 No significant differences in SVR were found according to age, baseline HCV RNA level, cirrhosis status, IL28B 
genotype, or HCV sub-genotype (1a vs. 1b).
A post hoc analysis of data from seven clinical trials to evaluate 
the efficacy and safety of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir with and without 
ribavirin included 161 treatment-naïve patients with genotype 1 
and compensated cirrhosis (genotype 1a 53%).57 The SVR following a 12-week treatment of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, 12-week treatment of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir plus ribavirin, 24-week treatment of 
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, and 24-week treatment of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir plus ribavirin were 96% (45/47), 98% (44/45), 97% (32/33), 
and 100% (36/36), respectively. SVR did not vary significantly with 
treatment duration (12 weeks 97% [89/92] vs. 24 weeks 99% 
[68/69]), presence/absence of ribavirin (99% [80/81] vs. 96% 
[77/80]), HCV sub-genotype (1a 98% [84/86] vs. 1b 97% [72/74]), 
or IL28B genotype (CC 98% (56/57) vs. non-CC 97% [101/104]).
Twelve- or 24-week treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir with or 
without ribavirin provided an overall SVR of 91% (42/46) in patients with baseline ledipasvir-specific RASs (NS5A positions 24, 
28, 30, 31, 32, 38, 58, 92, 93) and an SVR of 99% (539/546) in 
those without ledipasvir-specific RASs.20 In cirrhotic patients, the 
SVR was 86% (6/7) in patients with baseline ledipasvir-specific 
RASs and 99% (71/73) in those without ledipasvir-specific RASs.
In a phase 3, open-label study of 647 previously untreated HCV 
genotype 1 infected patients without cirrhosis (genotype 1a 
80%), the SVR following an 8-week treatment of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, 8-week treatment of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir plus ribavirin, or 
12-week treatment of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir were 94% (202/215), 
93% (201/216), and 95% (206/216), respectively.15 Virologic relapse rates were higher in the 8-week treatment arms than in the 
12-week treatment arm (5% [20/431] vs. 1% [3/216]). Post hoc
analyses assessed baseline predictors of relapse and identified a 
low relapse rate in patients receiving 8 weeks of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir who had baseline HCV RNA levels < 6,000,000 IU/mL 
(2/123; 2%). The same held true for patients with similar baseline 
HCV RNA levels who received 12 weeks of treatment (2/131; 2%).
Treatment-naïve HCV genotype 1 infected patients without cirrhosis (defined as FIB-4 ≤ 3.25) and with baseline HCV RNA< 
6,000,000 IU/mL (genotype 1a > 70%) showed a lower SVR 
[93.2% (1,020/1,094)] when treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 
8 weeks compared to those treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 
12 weeks (97% [875/906]).18
However, another study found that the SVR of treatment-naïve 
HCV genotype 1a infected patients without cirrhosis whose baseline HCV RNA< 6,000,000 IU/mL was 98% (372/381).19
Elbasvir/grazoprevir 
In a phase 3 study that evaluated the efficacy of a 12-week 
treatment with elbasvir/grazoprevir in treatment-naïve genotype 
1a infected patients, the SVR was 92%.13 The SVR in patients with 
compensated cirrhosis was 97%, which did not differ from that in 
patients without cirrhosis.13,58 SVR did not differ by age, gender,

race, or IL28B genetic polymorphism, but it was higher in patients 
with HCV RNA ≤ 800,000 IU/mL than in those with HCV RNA > 
800,000 IU/mL (100% vs. 92%). NS5A RASs were detected in 
12% of the genotype 1a infected patients, and the SVR was significantly lower in patients with RASs than in those without them 
(58% vs. 99%). However, the SVR was 100% (17/17) even in patients 
with RASs when pretreatment HCV RNA was ≤ 800,000 IU/mL.13 A 
pooled analysis of phase 2 and 3 clinical trials revealed that the 
SVR was 100% in genotype 1a infected patients with baseline 
NS5A RASs treated with elbasvir/grazoprevir and ribavirin for 16 
or 18 weeks.59,60 Another pooled analysis reported that NS5A 
RASs (M29, Q30, L31, or Y93 mutation) were detected in 11% 
(92/825) of treatment-naïve genotype 1a infected patients. The 
SVR was significantly lower in patients with RASs (73% [33/45]) 
than in those without them (98% [364/371]) following treatment 
with elbasvir/grazoprevir for 12 weeks. Treatment with elbasvir/
grazoprevir plus ribavirin for 16 or 18 weeks provided an SVR of 
100% in treatment-naïve HCV genotype 1a infected patients with 
baseline RASs.24
Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir plus dasabuvir 
In treatment-naïve patients with genotype 1a infection but not 
cirrhosis, the SVR after treatment for 12 weeks with a combination of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir plus dasabuvir with ribavirin was 95% (306/322).61 In another study of treatment-naïve 
HCV genotype 1 infected patients without cirrhosis, the SVR after 
ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir treatment without 
ribavirin for 12 weeks was 99% in genotype 1b patients, whereas 
it was 90% in genotype 1a patients.25 The SVR after receiving a 
combination of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, dasabuvir, and 
ribavirin for 12 or 24 weeks was 89% (124/140) and 94% 
(114/121), respectively, in treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced HCV genotype 1a patients with compensated cirrhosis.27
Daclatasvir and sofosbuvir 
In a phase 3 study that assessed the efficacy of a 12-week 
treatment of daclatasvir and sofosbuvir in treatment-naïve HCV 
genotype 1 infected patients (genotype 1a 71, 1b 12, compensated cirrhosis 9), the SVR was 96%.30 In a phase 2 study of treatment-naïve genotype 1 infected patients (n=126, genotype 1a 99, 
1b 27), the SVR after 12 or 24 weeks of daclatasvir and sofosbuvir 
treatment was 100% (41/41) and 100% (29/29) respectively, and 
the SVR after 12 or 24 weeks of treatment with daclatasvir and 
sofosbuvir with ribavirin was 95% (39/41) and 100% (15/15), with 
no statistical differences by treatment duration or the addition of 
ribavirin.31 However, only 14 genotype 1 infected patients with 
compensated cirrhosis were included in that study. In a cohort 
study of 768 genotype 1 infected patients (liver cirrhosis 73%, 
CTP classification B or C decompensated cirrhosis 3%, genotype 
1a 50%, treatment naïve 16%), the SVR after 12 or 24 weeks of 
treatment with daclatasvir and sofosbuvir was 92% (147/160) and 
95% (417/439), respectively, and the SVR after 12 or 24 weeks of 
treatment with daclatasvir and sofosbuvir with ribavirin was 94% 
(32/34) and 99% (133/135), respectively, with no statistical differences among treatment groups. However, the SVR was lower in 
patients with cirrhosis than in those without cirrhosis (88% 
[105/119] vs. 95% [423/444], P=0.0054).32 Although studies on 
the combination of daclatasvir and sofosbuvir are insufficient in 
treatment-naïve genotype 1a infected patients with compensated 
cirrhosis, given the lower SVR in cirrhotic patients and risk of 
emerging NS5A RASs in cases of treatment failure, 12-week treatment with daclatasvir and sofosbuvir with ribavirin or 24-week 
treatment with daclatasvir and sofosbuvir can be considered. 
Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir
In a phase 2 study for DAA-naïve, HCV genotype 1–6 infected 
patients without cirrhosis, the SVR after treatment with glecaprevir (200 mg) plus pibrentasvir (120 mg) for 12 weeks, glecaprevir 
(200 mg) plus pibrentasvir (40 mg) for 12 weeks, or glecaprevir 
(300 mg) plus pibrentasvir (120 mg) for 8 weeks was 100%, 
97%, and 97%, respectively, in genotype 1 infected patients 
(n=133, treatment experience 30%).36 In a phase 3 study that assessed the efficacy and safety of 8- and 12-week treatment with 
glecaprevir (300 mg)/pibrentasvir (120 mg) in genotype 1 monoinfected or HIV/HCV co-infected patients without cirrhosis (n=703, 
interferon-based treatment experience 28%, sofosbuvir-based 
treatment experience 0.4%), the SVR was 99% and 99.7%, respectively.37 In a pooled analysis of phase 2 and 3 studies of genotype 1–6 chronic HCV infected patients without cirrhosis (interferon-based treatment experience 23%, sofosbuvir-based 
treatment experience 1%), the SVR after treatment with glecaprevir (300 mg) plus pibrentasvir (120 mg) for 8 or 12 weeks was 
99% and 100%, respectively, in HCV genotype 1 infected patients without cirrhosis (n=788, genotype 1a 44%).38
In a phase 2 study of DAA-naïve HCV genotype 1 infected patients with compensated cirrhosis (n=27, interferon-based treatment experience 22%), the SVR after a 12-week treatment with 
glecaprevir (200 mg) plus pibrentasvir (120 mg) was 96%.39

in patients infected with HCV genotype 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6 and compensated cirrhosis (n=146, interferon-based treatment experience 
17%, sofosbuvir-based treatment experience 8%), the SVR was 
99% in HCV genotype 1a infected patients (n=48).40
Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir
In a phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled study recruiting 
untreated and previously treated patients with HCV genotype 1, 2, 
4, 5, or 6, including those with compensated cirrhosis, the SVR 
after a 12-week treatment with sofosbuvir (400 mg)/velpatasvir 
(100 mg) was 98% (157/161) in HCV genotype 1a infected patients without cirrhosis and 100% (49/49) in those with compensated cirrhosis. The SVR of treatment-naïve HCV genotype 1a infected patients was 97% (128/132).42
Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir
In a phase 3, open-label trial, HCV infected patients who had 
not previously been treated with DAAs were assigned randomly 
to an 8-week sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir treatment arm or 
a 12-week sofosbuvir/velpatasvir treatment arm (n=941, conventional or pegylated interferon experience 23%).43 In genotype 1a 
patients, the SVR after the 8-week sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir or 12-week sofosbuvir/velpatasvir treatment were 92% 
(155/169) and 99% (170/172), respectively. Among HCV genotype 
1a infected patients without cirrhosis, the virologic relapse rates 
were 8% and 0% in the 8-week sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir and 12-week sofosbuvir/velpatasvir treatment groups, respectively. Among HCV genotype 1a infected patients with cirrhosis, 
the virologic relapse rates were 10% and 2% in the 8-week sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir and 12-week sofosbuvir/velpatasvir treatment groups, respectively. Therefore, among HCV genotype 1a infected patients, treatment responses after 8 weeks of 
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir were inferior to those after 12 
weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir. In addition, the SVR following 
treatment with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir for 8 weeks was 
89% and 95% in HCV genotype 1a infected patients with and 
without baseline NS5A RASs, respectively.
Retreatment of treatment-experienced genotype 1a 
patients
Ledipasvir/sofosbuvir 
In a phase 3, randomized, open-label study of previously treated HCV genotype 1 infected patients (n=440, genotype 1a 79%, 
cirrhosis 20%, protease inhibitor experience 53%), the SVR following 12 weeks of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, 12 weeks of ledipasvir/
sofosbuvir plus ribavirin, 24 weeks of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, or 24 
weeks of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir plus ribavirin were 94% (102/109), 
96% (107/111), 99% (108/109), and 99% (110/111), respectively.44
Virologic relapse rates were 6% (7/109), 4% (4/111), 0% (0/109), 
and 0% (0/111), respectively. Baseline viral load, age, IL28B genotype, and sub-genotype had no significant effect on treatment responses. In cirrhotic patients, the SVR following a 12-week ledipasvir/sofosbuvir treatment, 12-week ledipasvir/sofosbuvir plus 
ribavirin treatment, 24-week ledipasvir/sofosbuvir treatment, or 
24-week ledipasvir/sofosbuvir plus ribavirin treatment were 86% 
(19/22), 82% (18/22), 95% (21/22), and 100% (22/22), respectively.
A post hoc analysis of data from seven clinical trials to evaluate 
the efficacy and safety of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir with and without 
ribavirin included 352 treatment-experienced HCV genotype 1 infected patients with compensated cirrhosis (genotype 1a 63%, 
protease inhibitor experience 68%).57 The SVR following a 12-
week ledipasvir/sofosbuvir treatment, 12-week ledipasvir/sofosbuvir plus ribavirin treatment, 24-week ledipasvir/sofosbuvir treatment, and 24-week ledipasvir/sofosbuvir plus ribavirin treatment 
were 90% (64/71), 96% (152/159), 98% (98/100), and 100% 
(22/22), respectively. The relatively lower SVR in treatment-experienced patients treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 12 weeks 
raised the question of whether those patients would benefit from 
adding ribavirin or extending treatment duration to 24 weeks.
Among treatment-experienced HCV genotype 1a patients, the 
overall SVR following ledipasvir/sofosbuvir with or without ribavirin treatment for 12 or 24 weeks was 76% (22/29) in patients 
with baseline ledipasvir-specific RASs (K24G/N/R, M28T/A/G, 
Q30L/T/E/G/H/K, L31F/I/M/V, P32L, S38F, H58D, A92T/K, Y93F/C/
H/N/S) and 97% (409/420) in those without ledipasvir-specific 
RASs.20 In cirrhotic patients, the SVR was 77% (10/13) in patients 
with baseline ledipasvir-specific RASs and 98% (193/196) in those 
without ledipasvir-specific RASs. That is, treatment-experienced 
HCV genotype 1a patients with baseline ledipasvir-specific RASs 
had a lower response irrespective of their cirrhosis status.
Elbasvir/grazoprevir 
In a phase 3 study that assessed the efficacy and safety of a 12-
week treatment of elbasvir/grazoprevir in treatment-experienced 
HCV genotype 1a patients, the SVR was 92% (55/60).49 The SVR 
was 93% (56/60) in patients treated with elbasvir/grazoprevir 
plus ribavirin for 12 weeks, 94% (45/48) in those treated with elbasvir/grazoprevir for 16 weeks without ribavirin, and 100%

(55/55) in those treated with elbasvir/grazoprevir plus ribavirin for 
16 weeks. SVR did not differ significantly depending on the addition of ribavirin or the extension of the treatment duration.49 The 
SVR after 12 or 16 weeks of treatment with elbasvir/grazoprevir 
with and without ribavirin was 94% (135/144) in patients with 
compensated cirrhosis (genotype 1a [n=77], genotype 1b [n=50], 
genotype 4 [n=17], genotype 6 [n=3]), which did not differ from 
that in patients without cirrhosis (97% [255/264]).49 The presence 
of baseline NS5A RASs was a predictive factor for treatment failure, and amino acid substitutions at positions M28, Q30, L31, and 
Y93 were associated with lower SVR. The SVR after a 12-week 
treatment with elbasvir/grazoprevir was 99% in HCV genotype 1a 
patients without NS5A RASs but only 68% (21/31) in those with 
baseline NS5A RASs. The SVR after a 16- or 18-week treatment 
with elbasvir/grazoprevir plus ribavirin was 100% (6/6) in genotype 1a patients with baseline NS5A RASs.49 In another study, 
baseline NS5A RASs were detected in 21% of HCV genotype 1a 
patients, and the SVR after a 12-week treatment with elbasvir/
grazoprevir was significantly lower in patients with baseline NS5A 
RASs (64% [9/14]) than in those without them (96% [52/54]).59
However, the SVR was 100% (8/8) in patients with NS5A RASs 
after a 16- or 18-week treatment with elbasvir/grazoprevir plus 
ribavirin.59 In a pooled analysis of phase 2 and 3 studies of DAAnaïve patients, the SVR after a 12-week treatment with elbasvir/
grazoprevir was 97% (77/79) among PR-experienced HCV genotype 1a patients without NS5A RASs and 55% (6/11) in those 
with NS5A RASs. The SVR after 16 or 18 weeks of treatment with 
elbasvir/grazoprevir plus ribavirin was 100% (6/6), even in those 
with NS5A RASs.24 Because the treatment response in patients 
with NS5A RASs is inferior, NS5A resistance testing is recommended for genotype 1a infected patients before elbasvir/grazoprevir treatment, and treatment duration should be extended to 
16 weeks and ribavirin should be added if baseline NS5A RASs 
are identified.
Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir 
Among treatment-experienced HCV genotype 1a patients without cirrhosis, the SVR after a 12-week treatment of ombitasvir/
paritaprevir/ritonavir plus dasabuvir with ribavirin was 96% 
(166/173).50,54 Among treatment-experienced HCV genotype 1 patients with compensated cirrhosis (genotype 1a 262, 1b 119), the 
SVR after 12 and 24 weeks of treatment with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir plus dasabuvir with ribavirin was 90% (110/122) 
and 97% (95/98), respectively, with no statistical differences between the groups (P=0.09). However, the SVR was significantly 
lower in HCV genotype 1a infected patients (OR 0.12, P=0.04) 
and genotype 1 patients who showed null response to prior PR 
therapy (OR 0.39, P=0.04).27 
Daclatasvir and sofosbuvir 
In a phase 2 study of treatment-experienced HCV genotype 1 
patients (genotype 1a 33, 1b 8, cirrhosis 9), the SVR after a 24-
week treatment of daclatasvir and sofosbuvir with and without 
ribavirin was 100% (21/21) and 95% (19/20), respectively.31 In a 
cohort study of 768 genotype 1 infected patients (genotype 1a 
50%, liver cirrhosis 73%, CTP classification B or C decompensated cirrhosis 3%, PR experience 41%, 1st generation PI+PR experience 41%), the SVR after a 12- or 24-week treatment of daclatasvir and sofosbuvir was 92% (147/160) and 95% (417/439), 
respectively, and the SVR after a 12- or 24-week treatment of daclatasvir and sofosbuvir with ribavirin was 94% (32/34) and 99% 
(133/135), respectively, without statistical difference among treatment groups. However, the SVR was lower in cirrhotic patients 
than in those without cirrhosis (88% [105/119] vs. 95% 
[423/444], P=0.0054).32
Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir
In a phase 3 study that assessed the efficacy and safety of 8 or 
12 weeks of treatment with glecaprevir (300 mg)/pibrentasvir 
(120 mg) in genotype 1 monoinfected or HIV/HCV co-infected patients without cirrhosis (n=703, interferon-based treatment experience 28%, sofosbuvir-based treatment experience 0.4%), the 
SVR rates were 99% and 99.7%, respectively.37
In a pooled analysis of phase 2 and 3 studies of patients with 
HCV genotypes 1–6 without cirrhosis (interferon-based treatment 
experience 23%, sofosbuvir-based treatment experience 1%), the 
SVR after an 8- or 12-week treatment with glecaprevir (300 mg) 
plus pibrentasvir (120 mg) was 99% and 100%, respectively, in 
HCV genotype 1 patients (n=788, genotype 1a 44%).38
In a phase 3 study that assessed the efficacy and safety of a 12-
week treatment with glecaprevir (300 mg)/pibrentasvir (120 mg) 
in patients infected with HCV genotype 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6 and compensated cirrhosis (n=146, interferon-based treatment experience 
17%, sofosbuvir-based treatment experience 8%), the SVR was 
99% in HCV genotype 1a infected patients (n=48).40
Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir
In a phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of untreated and previously treated patients infected with HCV genotype 1, 
2, 4, 5, or 6, including those with compensated cirrhosis, the SVR

following a 12-week treatment with sofosbuvir (400 mg)/velpatasvir (100 mg) was 100% (78/78) in previously treated HCV genotype 1a patients.42
Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir
In a phase 3 open-label trial, HCV infected patients who had 
not been previously treated with DAAs were randomly assigned 
to an 8-week treatment with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir or 
a 12-week treatment with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (n=941, conventional or pegylated interferon experience 23%).43 Among genotype 1a patients, the SVR of the 8-week sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/
voxilaprevir and 12-week sofosbuvir/velpatasvir treatment groups 
were 92% (155/169) and 99% (170/172), respectively. In HCV 
genotype 1a patients without cirrhosis, the virologic relapse rates 
were 8% and 0% in the 8-week sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir and 12-week sofosbuvir/velpatasvir treatment groups, respectively. Among HCV genotype 1a patients with cirrhosis, virologic 
relapse rates were 10% and 2% in the 8-week sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir and 12-week sofosbuvir/velpatasvir treatment 
groups, respectively. Therefore, among HCV genotype 1a patients, 
treatment responses after 8 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir treatment were inferior to those after 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir treatment. In addition, the SVR after the 8-week 
treatment with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir was 89% and 
95%, respectively, in HCV genotype 1a patients with and without 
baseline NS5A RASs.

Treatment of chronic hepatitis C or 
compensated cirrhosis patients with
HCV genotype 2 infection
Initial treatment of genotype 2 patients
Sofosbuvir and ribavirin 
According to a study comparing 12 weeks of sofosbuvir and ribavirin with 24 weeks of peginterferon alpha and ribavirin in treatment-naïve patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 2, the SVR 
were 97% (68/70) and 78% (52/67), respectively. The SVR following 12 weeks of sofosbuvir and ribavirin in patients with and 
without liver cirrhosis was 91% (10/11) and 98% (58/59), respectively.62
In a phase 3 study of patients ineligible for peginterferon therapy (including 8% of enrolled patients who discontinued therapy 
due to an adverse event), the SVR following 12 weeks of sofosbuvir and ribavirin therapy was 93% (101/109). The SVR in patients

with and without liver cirrhosis was 94% (16/17) and 92% 
(85/92), respectively.62
In a phase 3 study of Korean and Taiwanese patients, the SVR 
following 12 weeks of sofosbuvir and ribavirin treatment was 
96% (101/105), and all 6 patients with liver cirrhosis showed an 
SVR.63 In a Japanese study, the SVR rate following 12 weeks of 
sofosbuvir and ribavirin was 98% (88/90), and all 8 patients with 
liver cirrhosis showed an SVR.64
In a phase 3 study of 12 weeks of sofosbuvir and ribavirin therapy, the SVR in treatment-naive patients was 97% (31/32), and 
the SVR in patients with and without liver cirrhosis were 100% 
(2/2) and 97% (29/30), respectively.65
Studies on the optimal treatment duration of sofosbuvir and ribavirin therapy are very limited in treatment-naïve patients with 
chronic HCV infection and liver cirrhosis.
In a Korean real life study, the SVR following 12 weeks of sofosbuvir and ribavirin was 98% (177/181) in treatment-naïve patients 
without liver cirrhosis. The SVR after 16 weeks of sofosbuvir and 
ribavirin therapy was 96% (50/52) in patients with liver cirrhosis, 
although it is not possible to distinguish between treatment-naive 
and experienced patients in that analysis.66
In a real life study of sofosbuvir and ribavirin therapy among 
treatment-naïve and experienced patients, the SVR of treatmentnaïve patients with or without liver cirrhosis was 72% (23/32) and 
92% (159/173), respectively, after 12 weeks of therapy and 100% 
(7/7) and 91% (10/11), respectively, after 16 weeks of therapy.67
Another real life study (treatment naïve 56%, liver cirrhosis 
58%) included patients with advanced fibrosis, who received 12 
weeks of sofosbuvir and ribavirin (n=123), and patients with liver 
cirrhosis, who received 16 or 20 weeks of sofosbuvir and ribavirin, 
(n=168, CTP class A 89%). The overall SVR in treatment-naïve 
patients was 98%. Although it is not possible to distinguish between treatment-naive and experienced patients, the SVR following 16 and 20 weeks of treatment in patients with cirrhosis were 
95% (86/91) and 91% (75/82), respectively.68
Daclatasvir and sofosbuvir
Only a few studies have considered daclatasvir and sofosbuvir 
combination therapy in patients with HCV genotype 2.
In a phase 2 study of daclatasvir and sofosbuvir therapy for 
treatment-naïve patients, the SVR was 92% (24/26). That study 
conducted daclatasvir and sofosbuvir therapy with and without 
ribavirin for 23 weeks (sofosbuvir monotherapy for 1 week followed by 23 consecutive weeks of daclatasvir and sofosbuvir with 
or without ribavirin) or 24 weeks, and 40% of the included patients had liver cirrhosis.31
In a study of daclatasvir and sofosbuvir for 8 or 12 weeks in patients with HIV/HCV coinfection, the SVR in treatment-naïve patients without liver cirrhosis was 83% (5/6) and 100% (11/11), respectively.30
Based on a sub-group analysis of genotype 2 patients from a 
real life study of genotypes 1–4 (total n=2,612, treatment naïve 
47%), 12 weeks of daclatasvir and sofosbuvir combination therapy yielded 100% SVR in all patients with (n=29) and without 
(n=17) cirrhosis, although it is not possible to distinguish between 
treatment-naive and experienced patients in that subpopulation.69
Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir
According to integrated analyses of seven phase 2 and 3 studies of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir treatment for 8 and 12 weeks in 
patients with genotypes 1–6 without cirrhosis (treatment-naive 
79% and 74%, respectively), the SVR of patients with genotype 2 
was 99% (193/195) and 100% (232/232), respectively.38
In a phase 3 study (treatment naïve 75%) of a 12-week regimen

of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir given to cirrhotic patients with genotypes 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6, the SVR in patients with genotype 2 HCV 
infection was 100% (31/31).40
Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir
In a phase 3 study comparing 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir with placebo in patients with genotype 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6 infection (treatment naive 68%, liver cirrhosis 19%), the SVR of patients with genotype 2 who received sofosbuvir/velpatasvir 
therapy was 100% (104/104).42
According to a phase 3 study comparing treatment with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 weeks and sofosbuvir and ribavirin for 12 
weeks (treatment naive 85%, liver cirrhosis 14%), the SVR were 
99% (133/134) and 94% (124/132), respectively (P=0.02).70
An integrated study of 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir 
showed an SVR of 99% (193/194) among treatment-naïve patients with genotype 2. The SVR of patients with liver cirrhosis 
was 100% (29/29), although it is not possible to distinguish between treatment-naive and experienced patients in that subpopulation.71
Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir
In a phase 3 study comparing 8 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/
voxilaprevir with 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir in patients 
with genotypes 1– 6 (treatment naïve 77%, liver cirrhosis 18%), 
the SVR of patients with genotype 2 was 97% (61/63) and 100% 
(53/53), respectively.43
Peginterferon alpha and ribavirin
The SVR of peginterferon alpha and ribavirin therapy among 
Korean patients with genotype 2 is reported to be 80% or 
more.72,73 Peginterferon-α 2a should be injected at a subcutaneous dose of 180 μg once a week, regardless of patient body 
weight, and peginterferon-α 2b is to be injected at a dose of 1.5 
μg/kg/week. Ribavirin should be administered as an 800 mg fixed 
dose, regardless of body weight or type of peginterferon.74-79
Retreatment of treatment-experienced patients
Sofosbuvir and ribavirin
In one phase 3 study of sofosbuvir and ribavirin for 12 weeks, 
the SVR of treatment-experienced patients was 90% (37/41): 
78% (7/9) and 94% (30/32) with and without liver cirrhosis, respectively.65
In a Korean real life study, the SVR following 12 weeks of sofosbuvir and ribavirin was 97% (32/33) among treatment-experienced patients without liver cirrhosis. The SVR following 16 
weeks of sofosbuvir and ribavirin was 96% (50/52) among patients with liver cirrhosis, although it is not possible to distinguish 
between treatment-naive and experienced patients in that subpopulation.66
In a phase 3 study of sofosbuvir and ribavirin therapy for treatment-experienced patients, the SVR with and without liver cirrhosis was 87% (26/30) and 88% (42/48), respectively, following 12 
weeks of therapy and 77% (13/17) and 100% (3/3), respectively, 
following 16 weeks of therapy.62
In a real life study of sofosbuvir and ribavirin for treatment-naïve 
and experienced patients, the SVR of treatment-experienced patients with and without liver cirrhosis was 72% (23/32) and 92% 
(159/173), respectively, following 12 weeks of therapy and 100% 
(7/7) and 91% (10/11), respectively, following 16 weeks of therapy.67
In a study comparing 12 weeks and 16 weeks of sofosbuvir and 
ribavirin therapy, the SVR of treatment experienced patients with 
liver cirrhosis was 87% (13/15) and 100% (17/17), respectively.80
In phase 3 study of Korean and Taiwanese patients, the SVR in 
treatment-experienced patients after 12 weeks of sofosbuvir and 
ribavirin therapy was 100% (24/24, including 7 liver cirrhosis patients).63 In a Japanese study, the SVR following 12 weeks of sofosbuvir and ribavirin therapy was 95% (60/63, including SVR of 
8/9 with liver cirrhosis).64
In a real life study of 16 or 20 weeks of sofosbuvir and ribavirin 
therapy for patients with liver cirrhosis (treatment-experienced 
51%), the SVR in patients with previous non-response and relapse 
was 91% and 100%, respectively. Although it is not possible to 
distinguish between treatment-naive and experienced patients in 
this analysis, the SVR following 16 and 20 weeks of treatment in 
patients with cirrhosis was 95% (86/91) and 91% (75/82), respectively.68
Daclatasvir and sofosbuvir
In a study of 12 weeks of daclatasvir and sofosbuvir for patients 
with HIV/HCV co-infection, 2 treatment-experienced patients had 
an SVR, including one patient with liver cirrhosis.30
Based on a sub-group analysis of patients with HCV genotype 2 
in a real life study (genotypes 1–4, n=2,612, treatment experience 53%), daclatasvir and sofosbuvir combination therapy for 12 
weeks yielded 100% SVR in all 17 patients without cirrhosis and 
all 29 patients with cirrhosis, although it is not possible to distinguish between treatment-naive and experienced patients in that

Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir
According to an integrated analysis of seven phase 2 and 3 
studies of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for 8 or 12 weeks in patients 
with genotypes 1–6 without cirrhosis (treatment-experienced 
21% and 26%, respectively), the SVR in patients with genotype 2 
was 99% (193/195) and 100% (232/232), respectively.38
In a phase 3 study of 12 weeks of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for 
cirrhotic patients with genotypes 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6 (treatment-experienced 25%), the SVR of patients with genotype 2 was 100% 
(31/31).40
Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir
In a phase 3 study comparing a 12-week course of sofosbuvir/
velpatasvir with placebo in patients with genotypes 1, 2, 4, 5, or 
6 (treatment experienced 32%, liver cirrhosis 19%), the SVR of 
patients with genotype 2 was 100% (104/104).42
According to a phase 3 study comparing 12 weeks of treatment 
with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir with 12 weeks of sofosbuvir and ribavirin therapy (treatment experienced 15%, liver cirrhosis 14%), the 
SVR were 99% (133/134) and 94% (124/132), respectively.70
In an integrated study of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 weeks, 
the SVR was 100% (44/44) among treatment-experienced patients with genotype 2. The SVR of patients with liver cirrhosis 
was also 100% (29/29).71
Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir
In a phase 3 study comparing 8 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/
voxilaprevir with 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir in patients 
with genotypes 1–6 (treatment experienced 23%, liver cirrhosis 
18%), the SVR of patients with genotype 2 was 97% (61/63) and 
100% (53/53), respectively.43

suppression in a pharmacodynamic study of HCV genotype 3.81,82
studies on daclatasvir and sofosbuvir combination therapy are 
very limited.
In a phase 3 study of 12 weeks of daclatasvir and sofosbuvir, 
the overall SVR for treatment-naïve patients was 90% (91/101), 
with an SVR of 58% (11/19) and 97% (73/75) in patients with 
and without liver cirrhosis, respectively.83
Based on a sub-group analysis of patients with genotype 3 in a 
real life study of patients with genotype 1–4 infection (n=2,612, 
treatment naïve 47%), 12 weeks of daclatasvir and sofosbuvir 
showed an SVR of 95% (18/19) in patients without cirrhosis, and 
12 weeks of daclatasvir, sofosbuvir, and ribavirin showed an SVR 
of 92% (121/131) in patients with liver cirrhosis, although it is not 
possible to distinguish between treatment-naive and -experienced 
patients.69
In a study evaluating the efficacy of 12 and 16 weeks of a daclatasvir and sofosbuvir combination regimen in patients with 
genotype 3 (treatment naïve 26%, liver cirrhosis 72%), the overall 
SVR was 80% (21/24) and 92% (24/26), respectively; the corresponding SVR in treatment-naïve patients were 83% (5/6) and 
100% (7/7), respectively.84
In a phase 2 study of 24 weeks of daclatasvir or sofosbuvir with 
or without ribavirin, the SVR was 89% (16/18).31
In a study of 12 and 24 weeks of daclatasvir and sofosbuvir 
therapy in patients with liver cirrhosis (combined use of ribavirin 
in 86% and 78% of patients, respectively), the SVR was 92% 
(34/37) and 95% (89/94), respectively, with an overall SVR of 
93% (68/73) in treatment-naïve patients.85
In a real life study of 24 weeks of daclatasvir and sofosbuvir 
with or without ribavirin (27% with liver cirrhosis), the SVR in 
treatment naïve patients was 100% (12/12) and 92% (23/25), respectively, though it is not possible to distinguish the presence or 
absence of liver cirrhosis in that analysis.86
The effects of RASs on daclatasvir and sofosbuvir combination 
therapy were tested in a phase 3 study of 12 weeks of daclatasvir 
and sofosbuvir. Although the researchers did not complete a subanalysis between treatment-naïve and -experienced patients, the 
SVR in RASs-positive patients with and without liver cirrhosis was 
30% (3/10) and 83% (15/18), respectively.83
Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir
In a phase 3 study comparing 8 and 12 weeks of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir and 12 weeks of daclatasvir and sofosbuvir in treatment-naïve patients without liver cirrhosis, the SVR was 95% 
(149/157), 95% (222/233), and 97% (111/115), respectively.87
According to an integrated analysis of seven phase 2 and 3 
studies of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for 8 or 12 weeks in patients 
with genotypes 1–6 without cirrhosis (all patients with genotype 
3 were treatment-naive), the SVR of patients with genotype 3 was 
97% (177/183) and 98% (258/262), respectively.38
In a phase 2 study comparing 12 weeks of combination therapy 
with glecaprevir (300 mg) and pibrentasvir (120 mg) with glecaprevir (300 mg), pibrentasvir (120 mg), and ribavirin (800 mg), the 
SVR in treatment-naïve patients were 100% (24/24) and 100% 
(24/24), respectively.39
Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir
In a phase 3 study comparing 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir with 12 weeks of sofosbuvir and ribavirin, the SVR in treatment-naïve patients were 97% (200/206) and 87% (174/201), respectively.70 Although the SVR with sofosbuvir and ribavirin 
combination therapy for 12 weeks differed significantly between 
patients with and without liver cirrhosis (73% [33/45] and 90% 
[141/156], respectively), the SVR of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 
weeks was similar between patients with and without liver cirrhosis (93% [40/43] and 98% [160/163], respectively). Although the 
researchers provide no detailed data according to treatment experience, the SVR in patients with and without an NS5A RAS (16%) 
was 88% (38/43) and 97% (225/231), respectively. Moreover, the 
SVR in patients with Y93H was 84% (21/25).
Given the current situation in Korea, where genotype 3-specific 
RAS testing is unavailable, the combined use of ribavirin is highly 
recommended in patients with liver cirrhosis. 
Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir
A phase 3 study compared 8 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/
voxilaprevir with 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir in patients 
with genotypes 1–6 (among patients with genotype 3, treatment 
naïve 77%, none of liver cirrhosis). The SVR of patients with genotype 3 was 99% (91/92) and 97% (86/89), respectively.43
In a phase 3 study comparing 8 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/
voxilaprevir and 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for cirrhotic 
patients with genotype 3 (69% treatment naïve), the SVR was 
96% (106/110) and 96% (105/109), respectively.
Sofosbuvir, peginterferon alpha, and ribavirin
In a phase 2 study of 12 weeks of sofosbuvir, pegylated interferon, and ribavirin in treatment-naïve patients without liver cirrhosis, the SVR was 92–100%.88,89
In a phase 3 study of 12 weeks of sofosbuvir, pegylated inter-

feron, and ribavirin, the SVR in treatment-naïve patients was 95% 
(89/94), and that in patients with and without liver cirrhosis was 
91% (21/23) and 96% (68/71), respectively.80
Peginterferon alpha and ribavirin
Genotype 3 chronic HCV infection is very rare in Korea, and information about the efficacy of peginterferon therapy is lacking. 
Studies from Western countries show that the SVR following a 24-
week combination therapy of peginterferon alpha and ribavirin for 
genotype 3 HCV infection was 60–70%, 10–20% lower than that 
for genotype 2 chronic hepatitis C.90-92
Peginterferon-α 2a should be injected at a subcutaneous dose 
of 180 μg once a week, regardless of patient body weight, and 
peginterferon-α 2b should be injected at a dose of 1.5 μg/kg/
week. Ribavirin should be administered at a fixed dose of 800 
mg, regardless of body weight or type of peginterferon.74,76
Retreatment of treatment-experienced patients
Daclatasvir and sofosbuvir
In a phase 3 study of 12 weeks of daclatasvir and sofosbuvir, 
the overall SVR was 86% (44/51) for treatment-experienced patients, with an SVR of 69% (9/13) and 94% (32/34) in patients 
with and without liver cirrhosis, respectively.83
Based on a sub-group analysis of patients with genotype 3 in a 
real life study of patients with genotypes 1–4 (total n=2,612, 
treatment experience 53%), 12 weeks of daclatasvir and sofosbuvir produced an SVR of 95% (18/19) in patients without cirrhosis, 
and 12 weeks of daclatasvir, sofosbuvir, and ribavirin produced an 
SVR of 92% (121/131) in patients with liver cirrhosis, although it is 
not possible to distinguish between treatment-naive and -experienced patients in that analysis.69
In a study of 12 and 16 weeks of daclatasvir and sofosbuvir 
combination therapy in patients with genotype 3 (treatment experienced 74%, liver cirrhosis 72%), the SVR rate in treatment-experienced patients was 88% (14/16) and 86% (12/14), respectively. 
The SVR in patients with and without liver cirrhosis, including 
treatment-naïve patients, was 83% (15/18) and 89% (16/18), respectively.84
In a real life study of 12 and 24 weeks of daclatasvir and sofosbuvir therapy (ribavirin combination in 86% and 78%, respectively) among patients with liver cirrhosis, the overall SVR was 92% 
(34/37) and 95% (89/94), respectively, with an SVR of 94% 
(55/58) among treatment-experienced patients.85
In another real life study of 24 weeks of daclatasvir and sofosbuvir combination therapy with and without ribavirin (liver cirrhosis 27%), the SVR in treatment-experienced patients was 84% 
(21/25) and 84% (26/31), respectively.86 The SVR rate with a 
combination regimen of daclatasvir, sofosbuvir, and ribavirin in 
patients with liver cirrhosis, including treatment-naïve patients, 
was 88% (29/33).
An additional real life study conducted compassionate daclatasvir and sofosbuvir therapy for 12 or 24 weeks with and without 
ribavirin (treatment experienced 72%, liver cirrhosis 77%) in patients with liver cirrhosis or pre/post-liver transplantation. The SVR 
was 73% (48/66), 60% (6/10), 89% (174/196), and 82% (50/61) 
following daclatasvir and sofosbuvir for 12 weeks, daclatasvir, sofosbuvir, and ribavirin for 12 weeks, daclatasvir and sofosbuvir for 
24 weeks, and daclatasvir, sofosbuvir, and ribavirin for 24 weeks, 
respectively.93
Elbasvir/grazoprevir and sofosbuvir
In a phase 2 study comparing 12 weeks of elbasvir/grazoprevir 
and sofosbuvir, 12 weeks of elbasvir/grazoprevir, sofosbuvir, and 
ribavirin, and 16 weeks of elbasvir/grazoprevir and sofosbuvir in 
cirrhotic patients with genotype 3 HCV, the SVR were 100% 
(17/17), 94% (17/18), and 94% (17/18), respectively.94
Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir
In a phase 2 study of 12 and 16 weeks of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir in patients without liver cirrhosis and 16 weeks of glecaprevir/
pibrentasvir in treatment-experienced patients with liver cirrhosis 
(peginterferon and ribavirin experienced 54%, sofosbuvir and ribavirin experienced with or without peginterferon 46%), the SVR 
were 91% (20/22), 96% (21/22), and 96% (45/47), respectively.95
In a phase 2 study comparing 12 weeks of combination therapy 
of glecaprevir (300 mg) and pibrentasvir (120 mg) with 12 weeks 
of glecaprevir (300 mg), pibrentasvir (120 mg), and ribavirin (800 
mg), the SVR in treatment-experienced patients was 75% (3/4) 
and 100% (3/3), respectively.39
Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir
In a phase 3 study comparing 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir and 12 weeks of sofosbuvir and ribavirin, the SVR of treatment-experienced patients was 90% (64/71) and 64% (44/69), 
respectively (P<0.001).70 The SVR following 12 weeks of sofosbuvir and ribavirin in patients with and without liver cirrhosis was 
58% (22/38) and 71% (22/31), respectively. The SVR rates from 
12 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir in patients with and without 
liver cirrhosis were 89% (33/37) and 91% (31/34), respectively.

Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir
In a phase 3 study comparing 8 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/
voxilaprevir with 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir in patients 
with genotypes 1–6 (among patients with genotype 3, treatment 
experienced 23%, none of liver cirrhosis), the SVR of patients with 
genotype 3 was 99% (91/92) and 97% (86/89), respectively.43
In a phase 3 study comparing 8 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/
voxilaprevir and 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir in cirrhotic patients with genotype 3 (treatment experience 31%), the SVR was 
96% (106/110) and 96% (105/109), respectively.
Sofosbuvir, peginterferon alpha, and ribavirin
In a phase 3 study of 12 weeks of sofosbuvir, pegylated interferon, and ribavirin, the SVR in treatment-experienced patients 
was 93% (166/181). The SVR in patients with and without liver 
cirrhosis was 86% (30/35) and 94% (49/52), respectively.80
[Recommendations] (Table 9)
Initial treatment of chronic hepatitis C or compensated cirrhosis 
patients with HCV genotype 3 infection
1. Daclatasvir and sofosbuvir could be administered for 12 weeks to 
patients without liver cirrhosis (B1). 
 Daclatasvir, sofosbuvir, and ribavirin could be administered for 24 
weeks to patients with liver cirrhosis (B1).
2. Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir should be administered for 8 weeks to 
patients without liver cirrhosis (A1). 
 Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir should be administered for 12 weeks to 
patients with liver cirrhosis (B1).
3. Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir should be administered for 12 weeks to 
patients without liver cirrhosis (A1). 
 Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir and ribavirin should be administered for 12 
weeks to patients with liver cirrhosis (A1).
4. Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir should be administered for 8 
weeks to patients with liver cirrhosis (A1). 
5. Peginterferon alpha and ribavirin could be administered for 24 
weeks (A2).
Retreatment of treatment-experienced chronic hepatitis C or 
compensated cirrhosis patients with HCV genotype 3 infection
1. Daclatasvir, sofosbuvir, and ribavirin could be administered for 12 
weeks to patients without liver cirrhosis (B1). 
 Daclatasvir, sofosbuvir, and ribavirin could be administered for 24 
weeks to patients with liver cirrhosis (B1).
2. Elbasvir/grazoprevir and sofosbuvir could be administered for 12 
weeks to patients with liver cirrhosis (B1).
3. Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir could be administered for 16 weeks (B1). 
4. Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir and ribavirin should be administered for 12 
weeks (A1).
5. Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir should be administered for 8 
weeks to patients with liver cirrhosis (A1).
Treatment of chronic hepatitis C or 
compensated cirrhosis patients with
HCV genotype 4 infection
The prevalence of genotype 4 chronic hepatitis C is estimated to 
be up to 20% of all hepatitis C patients, mainly in sub-Saharan 
Africa and Middle Eastern countries. The prevalence of genotype 
4 chronic hepatitis C in Korea is extremely low, so no reports have 
been made about the treatment efficacy of this genotype in Korea.
Ledipasvir/sofosbuvir
One phase 2 clinical trial using ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 12 
weeks in 21 CHC patients (cirrhosis n=7, treatment experience 
n=8) showed an SVR of 95% (20 patients),96 and another phase 2 
trial with the same treatment in 44 CHC patients (cirrhosis n=10, 
treatment experience n=22) showed an SVR of 93% (41 patients).97 Because the number of treatment-experienced genotype 
4 CHC patients available for clinical studies was small, the ledipasvir/sofosbuvir regimen could be recommended with a prolonged treatment duration, such as 24 weeks, or the 12 week 
treatment could be offered in combination with ribavirin in those 
patients to improve SVR, although the evidence is not yet robust.
Elbasvir/grazoprevir
Twelve weeks of treatment with elbasvir/grazoprevir achieved 
an SVR of 100% (18/18) in treatment-naïve genotype 4 CHC patients,13 but the same treatment showed an SVR of 78% (7/9) in 
treatment-experienced genotype 4 CHC patients, though combination treatment with ribavirin for 12 weeks showed an SVR of 
100% (15/15) in the latter population.49 A pooled analysis of 
phase 2 and 3 clinical trials using elbasvir/grazoprevir analyzed 66 
treatment-naïve and 37 treatment-experienced genotype 4 CHC 
patients. Among them, the treatment-naïve patients and patients 
who relapsed after a previous treatment showed an SVR of 96% 
(54/56) and 100% (2/2), respectively, following 12 weeks of elbasvir/grazoprevir treatment. But patients with on-treatment failure (including failure to suppress and breakthrough) in a previous 
treatment showed a higher SVR when they were treated with elbasvir/grazoprevir combined with ribavirin for 16 weeks than they 
did on elbasvir/grazoprevir for 12 weeks (12 weeks: 71% [5/7], 16 
weeks: 60% [3/5], 12 weeks+ribavirin: 91% [10/11], 16 
weeks+ribavirin: 100% [5/5]).98 In a phase 3 trial, patients co-in-

fected with HIV and HCV (genotypes 1, 4, and 6) showed an SVR 
of 96% (210/218) following 12 weeks of elbasvir/grazoprevir.99
Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir combined with 
ribavirin
In a phase 2 trial, ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir combined 
with ribavirin for 12 weeks produced an SVR of 100% (42/42) and 
100% (49/49), respectively, in treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced genotype 4 CHC patients without cirrhosis.100 In a 
phase 3 trial of 120 genotype 4 CHC compensated cirrhosis patients, ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir combined with ribavirin for 
12 or 16 weeks of treatment showed an SVR of 97% (57/59) and 
98% (60/61), respectively.101
Daclatasvir and sofosbuvir 
Daclatasvir and sofosbuvir combination treatment for 12 weeks 
achieved an SVR in all 6 patients co-infected with HIV and genotype 4 HCV.29 In one retrospective study of 47 genotype 4 CHC 
patients, daclatasvir and sofosbuvir combination therapy for 12 
weeks showed an SVR of 100% (32/32), without additional benefit from adding ribavirin or prolonging the treatment to 24 
weeks.102 In another retrospective study of 215 genotype 4 CHC 
patients, including 179 treatment-experienced patients, daclatasvir and sofosbuvir combination treatment with or without ribavirin 
for 12 or 24 weeks showed an overall SVR of 91% (195/215). 
However, in cirrhotic patients, the SVR following daclatasvir and 
sofosbuvir combination therapy for 12 weeks without ribavirin 
was reduced to 84% (53/63), and prolonging the treatment duration to 24 weeks or adding ribavirin improved the SVR to 93% 
(102/110) and 88% (7/8), respectively.103
Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir
Twelve weeks of treatment with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir showed 
a 100% (genotype 4 22/22) SVR rate in a phase 2 clinical trial of 
genotype 4–6, DAA-naïve CHC patients without cirrhosis (treatment experience 15%).36 One phase 3 trial also showed an SVR of 
99% (genotype 4 75/76, genotype 5 26/26, genotype 6 19/19). 104
In that phase 3 trial, the one genotype 4 CHC patient who did not 
achieve SVR prematurely left the study at day 12. In another 
phase 3 trial of genotype 1–6 CHC patients, including some cirrhotic patients (treatment experience 25%: interferon based 17%, 
sofosbuvir based 8%) a 12-week glecaprevir/pibrentasvir treatment showed an SVR of 100% in 16 genotype 4 CHC patients.40
In an integrated analysis of phase 2 and 3 clinical trials using glecaprevir/pibrentasvir in genotype 1–6 CHC patients without cirrhosis, 8 week and 12 week treatments of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir 
showed an SVR of 93% (43/46) and 99% (111/112), respectively, 
in genotype 4 patients.38
Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir
Twelve weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir treatment showed an 
SVR of 100% in a phase 3 clinical trial of 116 genotype 4 CHC 
patients (cirrhosis 20%, treatment experience 45%).42 In another 
phase 3 trial of HIV/HCV co-infected patients, 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir treatment achieved an SVR of 100% SVR in 4 
genotype 4 patients.105
Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir 
In a phase 3 clinical trial of DAA-naïve genotype 1–6 CHC patients 
(cirrhosis 18%, treatment experience 23%), 8 and 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir treatment showed an SVR of 94% 
(59/63) and 98% (56/57), respectively, in genotype 4 patients.43

Treatment of chronic hepatitis C or 
compensated cirrhosis patients with
HCV genotype 5 or 6 infection
Genotype 5 chronic hepatitis C patients are mainly distributed 
in Southern Africa, and there has been no report of such a patient 
in Korea yet.106 Genotype 6 CHC patients are found mainly in 
Southeastern Asia; southern part of China, Hong Kong, and Macao. The prevalence in Korea is only around 1%.106 Because of the 
paucity of genotype 5 and 6 CHC patients in Korea, clinical studies of these patients are few.
Ledipasvir/sofosbuvir
A phase 2 clinical trial using 12 weeks of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir 
in 41 genotype 5 CHC patients (cirrhosis n=9, treatment experience n=20) showed an SVR of 95% (39/41),104 and another study 
with the same regimen in 25 genotype 6 CHC patients (cirrhosis 
n=2, treatment experience n=2) showed an SVR of 96% 
(24/25).81 In a community-based retrospective study, 12 weeks of

Daclatasvir and sofosbuvir 
There has been no report using daclatasvir and sofosbuvir combination treatment in genotype 5 or 6 CHC patients. In a retrospective study, daclatasvir and sofosbuvir combination therapy for 
12 or 24 weeks both showed an SVR of 100% (25/25, 5/5, respectively).103
Because the number of treatment-experienced genotype 5 and 
6 CHC patients is small in available clinical studies, a ledipasvir/
sofosbuvir regimen or daclatasvir and sofosbuvir combination 
treatment could be recommended, with a treatment duration of 
24 weeks or 12 weeks in combination with ribavirin in these patients, although the evidence is not yet robust.
Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir
Twelve weeks of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir treatment showed an 
SVR of 100% (genotype 4 1/1, genotype 6 11/11) in a phase 2 
clinical trial of genotype 4–6, DAA naïve CHC patients without 
cirrhosis (treatment experience 15%).36 That same regimen also 
showed an SVR of 99% (genotype 4 75/76, genotype 5 26/26, 
genotype 6 19/19) in a phase 3 trial.104 In another phase 3 trial of 
genotype 1–6 CHC patients, including some cirrhotic patients 
(treatment experience 25%: interferon based 17%, sofosbuvir 
based 8%), 12 weeks of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir treatment 
showed an SVR of 100% in 2 genotype 5 patients and 7 genotype 6 patients.40 In an integrated analysis of phase 2 and 3 clinical trials using glecaprevir/pibrentasvir in genotype 1–6 CHC patients without cirrhosis, 8 weeks and 12 weeks of glecaprevir/
pibrentasvir treatment showed an SVR of 100% (2/2) and 100% 
(28/28), respectively, in genotype 5 patients and 90% (9/10) and 
100% (31/31), respectively, in genotype 6 patients.38
Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir
Twelve weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir treatment showed an 
SVR of 97% (34/35) in 35 genotype 5 CHC patients (cirrhosis 
14%, treatment experience 31%) and 100% (41/41) in 41 genotype 6 CHC patients (cirrhosis 15%, treatment experienced 7%) in 
a phase 3 clinical trial.42
Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir
In a phase 3 clinical trial of DAA naïve genotype 1–6 CHC patients (cirrhosis 18%, treatment experience 23%), 8 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir treatment showed an SVR of 94% 
(17/18) in genotype 5 patients. Eight weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir and 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir treatment showed an SVR of 100% and 100% (30/30, 9/9, respectively) in genotype 6 patients.43
Peginterferon alpha and ribavirin 
The SVR in chronic HCV genotype 5 or 6 patients treated with a 
combination of peginterferon alpha and ribavirin was 70–86%, 
which is comparable with that of HCV genotype 3 and higher 
than that of HCV genotype 1.108-110 If DAAs are unavailable, a previous standard therapy, such as a combination of peginterferon 
alpha and ribavirin for 24 weeks, remains acceptable.

TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH DECOMPENSATED CIRRHOSIS
Liver transplantation is the only treatment option for patients

with end-stage liver disease, but HCV infection frequently recurs 
due to graft infection after transplantation, which is a major 
cause of morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing liver 
transplantation. Controversy remains about whether to treat HCV 
infection before or after transplantation in patients with decompensated liver disease. It is anticipated that patients successfully 
achieving an SVR to anti-HCV therapy prior to transplantation 
would have improvements in liver function, allowing liver transplantation to be avoided. However, response to antiviral therapy 
before transplantation is reportedly worse than that from treating 
early HCV recurrence after transplantation, and thus, unsuccessful 
pre-transplant antiviral therapy can lead to missed opportunities 
to cure end-stage liver disease with transplantation.111 Therefore, 
the decision to treat HCV in patients with impaired hepatic function should be individualized, with consideration of the indications 
for transplantation, the availability of liver grafts, and the feasibility of liver transplantation. In general, a combination therapy of 
sofosbuvir and NS5A inhibitors such as ledipasvir, daclatasvir, or 
velpatasvir is recommended for the treatment of patients with decompensated cirrhosis (Table 12).
In a multicenter controlled study of 108 patients with HCV genotypes 1 and 4 with decompensated cirrhosis (CTP class B or C, 
CTP scores ≤ 12), participants were randomly assigned to receive 
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir and ribavirin (initial dose of 600 mg, increased as tolerated) for 12 or 24 weeks. SVR was achieved in 
87% and 89% of patients given the 12- and 24-week treatment 
courses, respectively. Baseline CTP and Model for End-Stage Liver 
Disease (MELD) scores improved in more than 50% of the patients, but some patients experienced worsening of hepatic function. During the treatment, five (5%) patients died of variceal 
bleeding. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 15% and 34% 
of patients in the 12- and 24-week arms, respectively.112
In a phase III study, 60 patients with decompensated cirrhosis 
(mostly CTP class B and C, HCV genotype 1/3/2, 4, 6=45/6/9) received daclatasvir daily in combination with sofosbuvir and a low 
initial dose of ribavirin (600 mg) for 12 weeks.33 The overall SVR 
was 83%. SVR was observed in 76% and 100% of patients with 
HCV genotypes 1a and 1b, respectively. In patients with HCV 
genotype 1 infection, the SVR rates were 92% and 50% among 
patients with CTP class B and C, respectively. Among subjects 
with HCV genotype 3 and 2/4/6, the SVR rates were 83% and 
89%, respectively.
A recent multicenter, open-label trial involving 267 previously 
treated and untreated patients with CTP class B (genotype 1a, 
159; genotype 1b, 48; genotype 2, 12; genotype 3, 39; genotype 
4, 8; and genotype 6, 1) evaluated the efficacy and safety of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir with or without ribavirin. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive sofosbuvir/velpatasvir once daily for 12 
weeks, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir plus ribavirin for 12 weeks, or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 24 weeks. The SVR was 88%, 94%, and 
93%, respectively, in patients with genotype 1a, and 89%, 100%, 
and 88%, respectively, in patients with genotype 1b. The correTable 11. Treatment of chronic hepatitis C or compensated cirrhosis patients with hepatitis C virus genotype 5 or 6 infection

sponding rates were 100%, 100%, and 75%, for patients with 
genotype 2 and the rates were 50%, 85%, and 50%, for patients 
with genotype 3, respectively. Among patients with HCV genotype 4, all (100%) achieved an SVR to the sofosbuvir/velpatasvirbased regimens.113
In a retrospective study involving 409 patients with decompensated cirrhosis who were treated with sofosbuvir, ledipasvir, or 
daclatasvir, with or without ribavirin, the SVR was 85% (11/13) in 
patients with genotype 1 with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 12 weeks, 
91% (136/149) in those with ribavirin added to ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 12 weeks, 50% (2/4) in those with daclatasvir and sofosbuvir for 12 weeks, and 88% (30/34) in those with ribavirin added to daclatasvir and sofosbuvir for 12 weeks. Among patients 
with HCV genotype 3, an SVR was achieved in 60% (3/5) of patients who received daclatasvir and sofosbuvir for 12 weeks and 
in 71% (75/105) of patients with ribavirin added to daclatasvir 
and sofosbuvir for 12 weeks.114 Improvement in the MELD score 
was more frequently observed in patients with DAA treatment 
than in those without. The benefits of DAA treatment were less 
likely to be found among patients who had hypoalbuminemia 
(<3.5 g/dL) or hyponatremia (<135 mmol/L) at baseline, as well 
as among elderly patients (>65 years). 
Data on the efficacy of 24 weeks of daclatasvir and sofosbuvir 
with or without ribavirin for decompensated liver disease was reported from 165 European patients (CTP class B 143, CTP class C 
22; genotype 1, 73%; genotype 3, 21%; genotype 4, 4%). The 
SVR rate was 86% (115/134) in patients with CTP class B and 
76% (16/21) in patients with CTP class C. Among patients with 
genotype 3, response to a 24-week combination therapy of daclatasvir, sofosbuvir, and ribavirin was 87% (13/15) in the CTP class 
B group and 100% (2/2) in the CTP class C group. The overall response rates varied according to baseline liver function, with significantly low SVR rates in patients with CTP class C or MELD 
scores of ≥16.86
Taken together, those results reveal that DAA therapy can improve liver function in 50–80% of patients with advanced liver 
disease, even with decompensated cirrhosis. However, a subset of 
patients with severe decompensation might not improve or might 
even progress after DAA therapy, suggesting that there could be 
a point of no return at which anti-HCV therapy cannot reverse liver dysfunction. In a study involving 92 Australian cirrhotic patients 
with MELD scores of ≥15 who received a combination of daclatasvir and sofosbuvir without ribavirin for 24 weeks, improvement in 
liver function (a decrease in MELD scores by ≥2) after DAA therapy was observed in 50% of the whole patient group and was limited to patients with baseline MELD scores ≤20. Therefore, an improvement in liver function following DAA therapy is unlikely in 
patients with a baseline MELD score of ≥20.115
Among DAAs, PIs (asunaprevir, paritaprevir, grazoprevir) and 
dasabuvir are contraindicated in patients with decompensated 
cirrhosis (CTP class B and C) and in those with a past history of 
decompensated complications due to drug toxicity from increased 
drug concentrations. The recently developed DAA drugs, glecaprevir and voxilaprevir, are also contraindicated in patients with 
CTP class B or C because of significant changes in plasma drug 
concentrations. Among patients with compensated cirrhosis, hepatic failure and mortality were reported during the first 1–4 
weeks of paritaprevir, ombitasvir, and dasabuvir therapy.116
There is very little information on DAA therapy for decompensated patients with CTP class C. Efficacy and safety data in patients with more advanced liver disease (CTP scores≥13) are limited and require verification, due to a lack of clinical study. Patients 
with advanced liver disease should be regularly monitored for 
consideration of liver transplantation because the risk of liver cancer or progressive liver disease is not eliminated, even in patients 
achieving an SVR to anti-HCV therapy.117
With the advent of interferon-free, all-oral DAA regimens, successful treatment of HCV infection can be considered in patients 
with decompensated cirrhosis. However, anti-HCV treatment for 
this particular group is complicated and should be carefully balanced against its potential disadvantages. In fact, overall response rates to pre-transplant DAA therapy are still lower than 
those from treating early HCV recurrence after transplantation.111
Therefore, the decision to treat HCV infection in patients with decompensated cirrhosis should be individualized under consideration of the accessibility of transplantation and the waiting time 
for liver transplantation.
[Recommendations] (Table 12)
General recommendations
1. Patients with decompensated cirrhosis (CTP class B or C) and 
HCV viremia should be referred to a medical specialist or liver 
transplant center (C1). 
2. Patients can be treated for HCV infection if the waiting time 
for liver transplantation is more than 6 months or if liver 
transplantation is infeasible (B1).
3. Particular care should be taken to monitor drug-related adverse 
events or toxicity when treating patients on the waiting list for 
transplantation or those with severe decompensation (B1).
4. Protease inhibitors should not be used in patients with 
decompensated cirrhosis due to drug-related adverse effects (A1).

 Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir could be administered for 24 weeks to

LIVER TRANSPLANTATION AND OTHER ORGAN TRANSPLANTS
Treatment before liver transplantation
HCV reinfection occurs within several hours after transplantation in most patients with detectable HCV RNA at the time of 
transplantation.118 Thus, patients with HCV infection at the time 
of LT have a higher graft failure rate (hazard ratio [HR], 1.30; 95% 
confidence interval [CI], 1.21–1.39) and mortality rate (HR, 1.23; 
95% CI, 1.12–1.35) than patients without HCV infection.119 HCVrelated liver diseases rapidly deteriorate following liver transplantation, and around one-third of patients progress to cirrhosis 
within 5 years after transplantation.120 Therefore, successful elimination of HCV before or after transplantation is critical to improving the prognosis of the graft and patient. 
Treatment of HCV infection in patients awaiting transplantation 
has two goals: i) preventing liver graft infection after transplantation and ii) improving liver function before transplantation in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. The improvement of liver 
function could lead to delisting of some of patients awaiting 
transplantation.111 However, the duration of DAA therapy might 
be insufficient in a patient on the waiting list because the time to 
liver transplantation is unpredictable. 
In a phase 2, open-label study, 61 patients infected with HCV 
genotype 1, 2, 3, or 4 were treated with sofosbuvir and ribavirin 
for up to 48 weeks prior to transplantation; 46 of those patients 
received transplants. Among the 43 patients with an HCV RNA 
level < 25 IU/mL at the time of transplantation, 30 (70%) had an 
SVR post-transplantation. The duration of undetectable HCV RNA 
before transplantation was the best predictor of a post-treatment 
response. HCV recurrence occurred in 64% (9/14) versus 4% 
(1/26) in patients with undetectable HCV RNA for less than 30 
continuous days versus more than 30 days before transplantation, 
respectively.121 
According to consensus statements from the European Liver 
and Intestine Transplant Association on the use of DAAs in the 
setting of liver transplantation, patients with a baseline MELD≤20 
have a 12–35% chance of being delisted after DAA therapy because of clinical improvement, and they should thus be treated 
while listed. In contrast, patients with high baseline MELD scores 
(>25) are not recommended for pre-transplant DAA treatment because of an unknown probability of improvement post-treatment 
and potential DAA toxicity.122 In fact, an analysis of pooled data 
from studies of various DAA therapies for recurrent hepatitis C in 
transplant recipients showed an overall SVR greater than 85%.111
The SVR is reported to be even greater post-transplantation, 
reaching 91–100%, when DAA therapy is initiated early in the relapse after transplantation. Therefore, it is advantageous to treat 
such patients post-transplantation rather than pre-transplantation, when their liver dysfunction is severe.33,112 For patients with 
MELD scores between 21 and 25, a case-by-case multidisciplinary 
decision on which patients to treat is advised.122
Treatment following liver transplantation
All patients with post-transplant recurrence of HCV infection 
should be prioritized for antiviral therapy. In particular, antiviral 
treatment should be started as soon as possible when fibrosing 
cholestatic hepatitis, advanced fibrosis, or portal hypertension is 
noted because those conditions predict a rapid progression of liver disease and graft failure.

infected with HCV genotype 1 or 4, study participants were randomly assigned to receive ledipasvir/sofosbuvir and weight-based 
ribavirin (1,000 mg [<75 kg] to 1,200 mg [>75 kg]) for either 12 
or 24 weeks. In patients with Metavir fibrosis stages F0 to F3, an 
SVR was achieved in 96% and 98% of patients in the 12- and 24-
week arms, respectively. In patients with compensated cirrhosis, 
an SVR was achieved in 96% of patients in both the 12- and 24-
week arms. Efficacy was lower in patients with CTP class B cirrhosis (SVR 85% vs. 88% in the 12- and 24-week arms) or CTP class 
C cirrhosis (60% vs. 75% in the 12- and 24-week arms).112 Similar 
results were recorded in another study, which also assessed a 
combination therapy of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir and ribavirin for 12 
or 24 weeks in transplant recipients with recurrent hepatitis C. 
Genotype 1 patients without cirrhosis had an SVR of 93% (42/45) 
with 12 weeks of therapy and 100% (44/44) with 24 weeks of 
therapy. When analyzed according to baseline CTP class, the SVR 
following 12 and 24 weeks of therapy was 100% (30/30) and 
96% (27/28) in patients with CTP class A, 95% (19/20) and 100% 
(20/20) in CTP class B, and 50% (1/2) and 80% (4/5) in CTP class 
C, respectively.123
In an open-label study, daclatasvir was administered in combination with daily sofosbuvir and ribavirin (initial dose, 600 mg) for 
12 weeks to patients with recurrent HCV infection post-transplant 
(n=53, HCV genotype 1/3/2, 4, 6=41/11/1). Overall, 94% of the 
patients achieved an SVR. The SVR was 95% (39/41), 91% 
(10/11), and 100% (1/1) in patients infected with genotypes 1, 3, 
and 2/4/6, respectively.33 The median dose of ribavirin given to 
the patients was 480 mg/d, with no drug-related adverse events. 
Recently, the safety and efficacy of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir was 
investigated in 100 transplant recipients (genotype 1, 57%, genotype 2, 13%, genotype 3, 24%, genotype 4–6, 6%) who developed recurrent HCV infection (F0–F1 [80%], F2 [6%], and F3 
[14%]) after liver transplantation (n=80) or renal transplantation 
(n=20). The overall SVR was 98% after 12 weeks of therapy with 
glecaprevir/pibrentasvir.124 The efficacy of another DAA, such as 
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, is currently being studied in patients with 
recurrent hepatitis C post-transplant.
The use of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir plus dasabuvir and 
weight-based ribavirin for 24 weeks was assessed in patients with 
HCV infection who had no or mild fibrosis post-transplantation. 
The study involving 34 transplant recipients with Metavir fibrosis 
stage F0–F2 and an HCV genotype 1 infection (genotype 1a 29) 
reported an SVR of 97% (33/34). The most common adverse 
events were fatigue, headache, and cough. Two patients (6%) 
had serious adverse events; no patient died from treatment-related adverse events. Most patients received 600–800 mg of ribavirin at study initiation and at the completion of treatment. Overall, 
19 patients (56%) had a modification in the ribavirin dose during 
treatment, and five patients (15%) required erythropoietin. Dosages of calcineurin inhibitors were modified because of drug–
drug interactions with ritonavir and paritaprevir.125 Drug interactions can also occur with elbasvir/grazoprevir, which is 
contraindicated in post-transplant recipients receiving cyclosporine. In general, PI-containing regimens are not recommended for 
the treatment of relapsed hepatitis C after liver transplantation.126

in the treatment of recurrent hepatitis C post-transplantation.
Treatment following other organ transplants
Renal transplant patients with HCV infection display rapidly 
progressing hepatic fibrosis and high mortality related to hepatic 
failure; therefore, antiviral treatment prior to renal transplantation 
has been recommended in the past.127 However, with the introduction of DAAs, successful elimination of HCV after renal transplantation can be achieved. It remains to be determined whether 
patients with chronic hepatitis C should optimally proceed to renal 
transplantation with the expectation that their hepatitis C can be 
cured post-transplant to improve the outcome. Combination therapy with pegylated interferon α plus ribavirin causes a low SVR of 
around 18% and graft rejection in more than 30% of patients, 
leading to graft failure and death. Thus, DAA therapy is preferred 
over interferon-containing therapy in renal transplant patients.128,129
In a pooled analysis of 10 studies of 333 patients with renal 
transplantation (genotype 1, 88%; treatment naïve, 63%; liver 
cirrhosis, 25%) receiving 12–24 weeks of DAA therapy, sofosbuvir-based regimens were the most commonly used. The overall 
SVR in post-renal transplant patients treated with DAAs was 
94.2%, with an SVR of 67% (10/15) for the combination of sofosbuvir and ribavirin, 75% (3/4) for the combination of sofosbuvir 
and daclatasvir, and 98% (158/161) for the combination of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir with or without ribavirin. DAA therapy for 
renal transplant patients resulted in relatively good safety profiles, 
with drug discontinuation reported in only 2% of cases and stable 
kidney and liver function during therapy.129 Sofosbuvir-based combination therapies are highly recommended for recurrent hepatitis 
C after renal transplantation because of their excellent tolerability 
and safety. In a recent study of 100 patients undergoing liver and 
renal transplantation, glecaprevir/pibrentasvir was given for 12 
weeks and achieved an SVR of 98%, with no treatment-related 
adverse events.124
Of the currently approved DAAs, sofosbuvir, daclatasvir, and ledipasvir are generally recommended in transplant patients because they do not have drug interactions with the immunosuppressive agents used after transplantation and do not require 
dosage reduction (Table 14).129 No data on anti-HCV therapy before or after a transplant of the heart, lung, pancreas, small intestine, or cornea are available. When anti-HCV therapy is needed, 
DAA therapy is preferred over interferon-containing therapy.
[Recommendations] (Table 14)
General recommendations
1. Antiviral therapy can prevent graft infection in patients awaiting 
liver transplantation and should follow the recommendations 
according to liver function and HCV genotype (A1). 
2. Patients with decompensated cirrhosis and a MELD score ≤20–25 
can be treated as soon as possible prior to liver transplantation. 
Patients with decompensated cirrhosis awaiting liver transplantation 
with a MELD score > 20–25 could receive the transplant first 
without antiviral therapy and could be treated for HCV infection 
after liver transplantation (B1).
3. All patients who develop recurrent HCV infection after liver 
transplantation should be prioritized for antiviral therapy (A1). 
4. Antiviral treatment should be started as early as possible after 
liver transplantation (A1) because the development of fibrosing 
cholestatic fibrosis, advanced fibrosis, or portal hypertension after 
transplantation predicts a rapid progression of liver disease and 
graft failure (A1).

patients who are ribavirin intolerant or ineligible (C2).
7. When DAAs are administered to patients after transplantation, 
drug–drug interactions with immunosuppressants should be 
considered (A1). 
8. When antiviral therapy is considered in non-hepatic solid organ 
transplant recipients, DAA therapy is preferred over interferoncontaining therapy (A1).
TREATMENT OF SPECIAL POPULATIONS
Because clinical trials on patients with specific medical conditions have many limitations, antiviral treatment should be individualized in these populations.
Persons who inject drugs
Injection drug abuse is the main route of HCV transmission, and 
abusers show a significantly higher HCV infection rate than those 
without a history of drug abuse.130 Among Korean intravenous 
drug users, 48.4–79.2% test positive for anti-HCV antibodies.131,132
Narcotics are classified as psychotropic agents (ecstasy and 
methamphetamine), cannabis, and narcotics in the narrow-sense 
(heroin and cocaine). Among them, the proportion of psychotropic medicines has increased steadily since 2011, accounting for 
81.3% of abuse according to the Annual Narcotics Crime White 
Paper published by the Supreme Prosecutor’s Office (SPO) in 
2015. The treatment of persons who inject drugs (PWID) who 
have chronic HCV infection significantly reduces liver-related complications and transmission to healthy persons. However, active 
PWID tend to have an increased likelihood of treatment failure 
and reinfection if they do not receive adequate support for their 
drug abuse. Multidisciplinary cooperative treatment among medical and psychiatric counseling services and social support results 
in a significant increase in adherence to treatment.
A meta-analysis of more than 2,800 injection drug users 
showed an SVR of 44.9% in HCV genotype 1 patients and 70.0% 
in HCV genotype 2 and 3 patients treated with peginterferon-α
and ribavirin.133 Treatment outcomes from DAAs have not been 
fully evaluated in injection drug users, who have been widely excluded from clinical trials of DAAs. A few studies included injection drug users who received opioid agonist therapy. Treatment 
with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir for 12 weeks

resulted in an SVR12 of 97% (37/38) in genotype 1 HCV-infected, 
non-cirrhotic, treatment-naive injection drug users who also received opioid agonist therapy (methadone or buprenorphine).134
Also, elbasvir/grazoprevir treatment for 12 weeks resulted in an 
SVR12 of 93% (144/154) in genotype 1a HCV-infected, treatmentnaïve patients and 93% (28/30) in genotype 1b patients.135
Drug–drug interaction studies have reported no clinically important interactions between some DAAs (sofosbuvir, daclatasvir, 
and elbasvir/grazoprevir) and methadone or buprenorphine.111,134,136-138 However, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir can increase the 
serum concentration of buprenorphine through the inhibition of 
P-glycoprotein by ledipasvir. Co-administration of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir with buprenorphine or naloxone 
can also increase the concentration of the opioid agonist. In addition to opioid substitution therapy, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and sedatives are frequently used in patients with addiction 
problems. It was reported that no drug–drug interaction occurred 
between escitalopram or citalopram and DAAs. However, no pharmacokinetic data on other psychotropic agents are available111,139
Because ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir treatment, 
which inhibits CYP3A4, could interact with psychotropic agents, 
attention should be paid to potential drug interactions when they 
are used together.
[Recommendations]
1. PWID should be treated following the guidelines for persons 
without drug abuse after managing drug–drug interactions (B1). 
2. Multidisciplinary cooperative treatment from medical and 
psychiatric counseling services, social support by specialists in 
drug abuse, and improvement in the social environment can 
increase compliance with treatment among intravenous drug 
users (A1).
Chronic kidney disease
HCV infection rates in dialysis patients differ from 3% to 80% 
among regions140; anti-HCV positivity rates from the late 1990s to 
the early 2000s in Korea were 5.9–14.7%.141-143 In contrast, the 
Dialysis Registry, ESRD Registry Committee of the Korean Society 
of Nephrology reported an anti-HCV antibody positivity rate of 4% 
in 2016.144
The HCV infection rate is high in patients with chronic kidney 
disease (CKD). However, anti-HCV screening might not be needed 
for these patients. Screening should be selectively conducted 
when HCV-related glomerulonephritis clinically presenting as hematuria, albuminuria, or cryoglobulinemia is suspected. However, 
anti-HCV antibody testing should be done in patients undergoing 
maintenance dialysis for the first time or who were transferred 
from other dialysis units. In addition, when unexplained abnormal 
liver-related biochemical tests are found or HCV exposure is suspected, anti-HCV antibodies should be tested, and HCV RNA assays should be performed in patients who are continously negative for anti-HCV antibodies.145 The optimal interval for 
surveillance of HCV infection in anti-HCV negative patients in dialysis units is 6–12 months, taking into consideration the HCV infection rate of the dialysis unit in question.
Patients with CKD show a higher rate of progression to ERSD if 
they have HCV infection, and it was reported that dialysis patients 
with HCV infection had a higher mortality rate than those without.146,147 Patients scheduled for kidney transplantation should receive an anti-HCV assay and consider HCV treatment because the 
survival rate after kidney transplantation tends to be low in patients with HCV infection, with a higher possibility of graft rejection and increased occurrence of diabetes and membranous nephritis compared with patients without HCV infection.142 
Interferon-based antiviral therapy is not recommended after kidney transplantation due to possible graft rejection148-151; however, 
DAA-based antiviral therapy can be safely applied after kidney 
transplantation.
Indications for HCV treatment in CKD patients should be determined considering liver disease conditions and therapeutic complications. Sofosbuvir, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, elbasvir/grazoprevir, 
ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with dasabuvir, daclatasvir, asunaprevir, glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir are all administered at the same 
doses in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30–80 mL/min) as in those without kidney disease.
The safety and efficacy of those regimens have not been fully 
evaluated in patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) <30 mL/
min, and sofosbuvir is not recommended for patients with CrCl 
<30mL/min or those receiving dialysis.
In a study of genotype 1 HCV patients with CrCl<30 mL/min 
(n=20, genotype 1a 65%), regardless of dialysis, ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir with ribavirin (200 mg/day, genotype 1a) or without ribavirin (genotype 1b) for 12 weeks resulted 
in an SVR12 of 90% (18/20) without dose modification.152 Among 
genotype 1 HCV patients with CrCl<30 mL/min (n=235, 1b 48%, 
treatment naïve 80%, cirrhosis 6%), regardless of dialysis, elbasvir/grazoprevir for 12 weeks resulted in an SVR12 of 99% without 
dose modification.153

2017 KASL clinical practice guidelines: Management of chronic hepatitis C
http://www.e-cmh.org https://doi.org/10.3350/cmh.2018.1004
In patients with genotype 1–6 HCV infection and renal impairment of variable degrees, glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for 8–12 weeks 
without dose modification resulted in an SVR12 of 98%.154
Asunaprevir should be modified to 100mg daily in non-dialysis 
patients with CrCl <30 mL/min. No prospective study has examined the efficacy and safety of daclatasvir and asunaprevir for 24 
weeks in genotype 1b HCV-infected patients with renal impairment. In a retrospective Japanese study of dialysis patients, daclatasvir and asunaprevir for 24 weeks resulted in an SVR12 of 100% 
without dose modification, and no significant adverse events 
were reported.155
Dose adjustment is needed depending on the severity of kidney 
disease because PegIFN-α and ribavirin clearance are reduced by 
impaired kidney function. Moreover, ribavirin should be carefully 
used in patients with CrCl under 50 mL/min because it can cause 
severe hemolytic anemia.156 Patients with mild kidney disease 
(glomerular filtration rate (GFR)≥60 mL/min) can receive the same 
doses of therapeutic drugs as those without kidney disease. If a 
patient has severe kidney disease (GFR of 15–59 mL/min), 135 μg 
of PegIFN-α -2a or 1μg/kg of PegIFN-α -2b along with 200–
800mg/day of ribavirin twice a day with a gradual increase in 
dose is recommended.141 Patients on dialysis can take either interferon alpha or PegIFN-α, but the combination with ribavirin is not 
recommended. The SVR varied from 7–97% in studies of combination therapy with PegIFN-α (135μg/week) and low-dose ribavirin (200 mg/day) in patients on dialysis, and most studies reported a high rate of treatment discontinuation.
Antiviral therapy for HCV can be conducted in patients with 
HCV-related cryoglobulinemia or membranous glomerulonephritis. Immunosuppressive therapy or plasma exchange can be performed prior to antiviral treatment in such patients with nephrotic 
syndrome or a rapid decrease in kidney function.157,158
In 41 HCV-infected patients with cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, 
sofosbuvir and daclatasvir were administered for 12–24 weeks, 
and immunologic laboratory results were compared between preand post-treatment. All the patients achieved SVR12, and 37 
(90.2%) patients showed complete resolution of purpura, arthralgia, and skin ulcers. The mean serum levels of cryoglobulin decreased from 0.56±0.18 g/dL pre-treatment to 0.21±0.14 g/dL at 
week 36 (SVR12–24), and in half of the patients, cryoglobulin became undetectable.159 In another study, 12 HCV-infected patients 
with cryoglobulinemia and systemic vasculitis underwent sofosbuvir-based antiviral therapy (concurrent rituximab therapy in 4 patients). The SVR12 was 83%, and patients who achieved SVR12 
showed improvement in their serum creatinine and a decrease of 
proteinuria. In 89% of patients, serum levels of cryoglobulin decreased after completion of the DAA therapy.160
[Recommendations]
1. Testing for anti-HCV antibodies should be performed in patients 
with chronic kidney disease who are under or planning for kidney 
replacement therapy, such as dialysis or kidney transplantation (B1).
2. HCV RNA should be tested to confirm HCV infection in patients with chronic kidney disease who have a positive anti-HCV 
antibody test or a negative anti-HCV antibody test but unknown 
liver disease (B1).
3. Sofosbuvir, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, elbasvir/grazoprevir, ombitasvir/
paritaprevir/ritonavir with dasabuvir, daclatasvir, asunaprevir, 
glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, and sofosbuvir/
velpatasvir/voxilaprevir can all be used without dose adjustment 
in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30–80 
mL/min) (B1).
4. Treatment of genotype 1-HCV infected patients with chronic 
hepatitis or compensated cirrhosis and severe renal impairment 
(eGFR < 30 mL/min)
(1) Elbasvir/grazoprevir could be administered for 12 weeks without 
dose reduction (B1).
(2) Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir could be 
administered for 12 weeks without dose reduction. In genotype 
1a infection, ribavirin (200 mg/day) is added (B1).
(3) Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir could be administered, and treatment 
duration is the same as in patients with normal eGFR (B1).
(4) Daclatasvir and asunaprevir could be administered for 24 weeks 
in genotype 1b infection. In patients not on dialysis, the dose of 
asunaprevir needs to be reduced to 100 mg/day (C1).
5. In genotype 2–6 HCV patients with chronic hepatitis or 
compensated cirrhosis and severe renal impairment (eGFR<30 
mL/min), glecaprevir/pibrentasvir could be administered without 
modification of dose or treatment duration (B1).
6. In genotype 4 HCV patients with chronic hepatitis or compensated 
cirrhosis and severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min), 
elbasvir/grazoprevir could be considered for 12 weeks or 
ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir with ribavirin (200 
mg/day) could be considered for 12 weeks (C1).
7. In genotype 2, 3, 5, and 6 patients with eGFR less than 30 mL/
min, PegIFN-α (135 μg of alpha-2a or 1 μg/kg of alpha-2b/wk) and 
ribavirin (200–800 mg/day) could be considered (B1). 
 In patients on hemodialysis, pegIFN- α (135 μg of alpha-2a/wk) 
without ribavirin could be considered (C2).
Treatment of patients with HIV or HBV coinfection 
Chronic hepatitis C patients with HIV coinfection 
The HIV and HCV coinfection rate is reported to be 25% in 
Western countries161 and 5.0–6.6% in South Korea.162,163 Because 
the frequency of coinfection is relatively high, all HIV-infected pa-

tients should receive HCV testing, which consists primarily of an 
anti-HCV antibody assay. However, antibodies might not be present in 6% of HIV-infected patients, so an HCV RNA assay should 
be conducted in patients with idiopathic liver disease who are 
negative for anti-HCV antibodies.164 Chronic hepatitis C patients 
with risk factors for HIV infection should also be tested for HIV.
HIV-coinfected patients show rapid progress of liver disease, 
higher incidence of cirrhosis and mortality, and generally higher 
serum HCV RNA levels than those with HCV monoinfection.165-168
In particular, the progression of liver disease tends to accelerate 
with decreasing CD4+ lymphocyte counts and the deterioration 
of the immune system.169
In contrast, the recovery of immune function through antiretroviral therapy can delay the progression of liver disease by reducing 
HIV-related immune activation and inflammation.170-172 Therefore, 
antiretroviral therapy is generally recommended in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients regardless of their CD4+ lymphocyte count. However, antiretroviral therapy should be conducted carefully due to 
the high risk of liver toxicity caused by interactions between antiHCV and anti-HIV drugs, especially in HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with progressed liver disease.173,174 Antiretroviral therapy 
can be delayed in HIV treatment-naïve patients with a CD4+ lymphocyte count >500/mm3
 to prevent drug–drug interactions until 
HCV treatment is completed. In patients with a CD4 lymphocyte 
count <200/mm3
, antiretroviral therapy should be initiated 
promptly, but HCV therapy can be delayed until the patient is stable on HIV treatment because no data are available on the efficacy of DAA treatment in severely immunosuppressed patients.175,176
HIV/HCV-coinfected patients should be treated identically to 
HCV-monoinfected patients, and DAA treatment is recommended 
with priority because of the lower treatment efficacy of interferon-based regimens. When deciding on a regimen, considerations 
include drug–drug interactions with antiretroviral agents (Table 15), 
prior treatment history, and drug tolerance; moreover, expert consultation regarding HIV treatment is recommended.177
Therapeutic agents:
-Ribavirin: Anemia related to ribavirin is an increasingly important problem in treatment of HIV coinfection. It is more frequent 
and severe in patients taking zidovudine (AZT) and should therefore be avoided for those patients.178 Ribavirin can exacerbate didanosine (ddI) toxicity by inhibiting inosine-5-monophosphate dehydrogenase, and severe lactic acidosis, steatosis, and pancreatitis 
have been reported in patients taking ddI and ribavirin together; 
therefore, concomitant use of these two agents is contraindicated.178-180 Patients receiving AZT and (especially) ddI should be 
switched to an equivalent antiretroviral agent before a combination therapy including ribavirin.
-Sofosbuvir: No clinically significant drug–drug interactions 
have been identified with most antiretroviral drugs (efavirenz, tenofovir dipivoxil fumarate [TDF], emtricitabine, rilpivirine, ritonavirboosted darunavir, and raltegravir), but co-administration with 
tipranavir is not recommended.
-Ledipasvir/sofosbuvir: When rilpivirine or efavirenz is used 
with TDF as an antiretroviral agent for treatment of HCV-HIV 
coinfection, TDF levels are increased by ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, 
which could increase the risk of renal toxicity. Concomitant use 
with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in patients at high risk for renal toxicity 
(those with a CrCl of 30–60 mL/min or pre-existing evidence of 
Fanconi syndrome) or those taking TDF and a ritonavir-boosted 
PI, should be monitored for potential renal injury by assessing renal function every 2–4 weeks.159,181
-Daclatasvir: Dose adjustment of daclatasvir is not required 
when used with ritonavir-boosted darunavir or ritonavir-boosted 
lopinavir. The dose of daclatasvir should be reduced to 30 mg 
once daily with ritonavir-boosted atazanavir and cobicistat-containing antiretroviral regimens, and an increased dose (90 mg daily) of daclatasvir is recommended when it is used with efavirenz 
or etravirine.
-Asunaprevir: Among antiretroviral agents, PIs are not recommended because the blood concentration of asunaprevir can be 
increased. Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors 
(NNRTIs) other than rilpivirine are not recommended because they 
can decrease the therapeutic effect of asunaprevir.
-Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir: Paritaprevir is an inhibitor of OATP1B1 and can increase indirect bilirubin. Ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir plus dasabuvir should only 
be used with antiretroviral drugs with which they do not interact: 
raltegravir, enfuvirtide, TDF, emtricitabine, lamivudine, atazanavir, 
and dolutegravir. Because ritonavir has anti-HIV activity, and lowdose ritonavir has the potential to select HIV resistance to PI in 
patients not undergoing antiretroviral therapy, HIV/HCV-coinfected patients should achieve HIV RNA suppression prior to initiation 
of this regimen. In particular, because this combination contains 
100 mg of ritonavir, the dose of ritonavir used to boost HIV PIs

might need to be adjusted (or held) when administered with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir plus dasabuvir and then restored 
upon completion of HCV treatment. Concomitant use of efavirenz, 
rilpivirine, and darunavir with ritonavir-boosted lopinavir is not 
recommended. When that combination is used with ribavirin, unboosted HIV PIs, rilpivirine, and efavirenz should not be used. 
When this combination is used with efavirenz, emtricitabine, or 
TDF, gastrointestinal and neurologic adverse events and elevations of ALT can occur.159,182
-Elbasvir/grazoprevir: It is not recommended to use elbasvir/
grazoprevir concomitantly with any ritonavir-boosted HIV PI and 
efavirenz. Although no study has considered the interaction between etravirine or cobicistat-boosted elvitegravir and elbasvir/
grazoprevir, concomitant use of these drugs should be avoided. 
Elbasvir/grazoprevir can be used concomitantly with raltegravir, 
dolutegravir, rilpivirine, and HIV nucleoside analogues.
-Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir: It is not recommended to use 
glecaprevir/pibrentasvir concomitantly with any PI and efavirenz. 
Although no study has considered the interaction between etravirine or nevirapine and glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, concomitant use 
of these drugs should be avoided. Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir can be 
used concomitantly with all NRTIs, integrase inhibitor, elvitegravir/
cobicistat/emtricitabine/TDF, elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/
tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), and rilpivirine.
-Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir: Like ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir increases serum tenofovir levels. Thus, co-administration of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir and TDF can cause problems in 
patients with CrCl less than 60 mL/min and in those receiving an 
anti-HIV regimen that contains ritonavir or cobicistat. Use of TAF 
instead of TDF is recommended, and renal function should be 
monitored if TDF is used. Efavirenz decreases serum velpatasvir 
levels, so it is not recommended to use those drugs concomitantly. Etravirine and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir are also not recommended 
for concomitant use, although no study has considered their 
drug–drug interaction. It was reported that concomitant use of 
atazanavir/ritonavir with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir elevated serum indirect bilirubin levels. However, the clinical relevance of that finding is unclear.
-Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir: Co-administration of 
atazanavir and voxilaprevir should be avoided because atazanavir 
increases the serum levels of voxilaprevir. Tipranavir decreases the 
serum levels of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir, and efavirenz decreases the levels of velpatasvir and voxilaprevir. Thus, concomitant use 
of those drugs is not recommended. Monitoring of renal function 
is required when a TDF-containing HIV regimen is co-administered 
with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir.
Treatment efficacy: 
In 50 treatment-naïve patients with HCV genotype 1 and HIV 
co-infection without cirrhosis, the SVR was 98% after 12 weeks 
of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir treatment.181 After 12 weeks of ledipasvir/
sofosbuvir treatment, 335 patients coinfected with HIV and genotype 1 or 4 HCV who had been previously treated or untreated for 
HCV (cirrhosis 20%), showed an SVR of 96%.183
In 63 patients with HCV genotype 1 and HIV co-infection who 
were HCV treatment-naïve or had a history of prior treatment failure (including cirrhotic patients), the SVR was 91–94% after 12 or 
24 weeks of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir plus dasabuvir and 
ribavirin.182 After 12 weeks of daclatasvir plus sofosbuvir treatment in 153 previously untreated or treated patients with HIV/
HCV coinfection (genotypes 1–4), the SVR was 97–98%.30 In 59 
non-cirrhotic patients with HCV genotype 1 and HIV co-infection, 
the SVR was 87% and 97% after 12 weeks of elbasvir/grazoprevir 
without ribavirin and with ribavirin, respectively.70 In an open-label, phase III study of 106 patients (cirrhosis 18%) with HCV genotype 1–4 and HIV co-infection, the overall SVR was 95% 
(101/106) after sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 weeks: 95% (74/78) 
in genotype 1b, 100% (11/11) in genotype 2, 92% (11/12) in genotype 3, and 100% (5/5) in genotype 5.105 In 137 non-cirrhotic 
patients with HCV genotype 1–6 and HIV co-infection, 8 weeks 
of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir resulted in an SVR of 100%. In 16 cirrhotic patients with genotype 1–6 and HIV co-infection, the SVR 
rate was 93% after 12 weeks of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir.
In patients with genotype 2 or 3 infection, including those with 
compensated cirrhosis, sofosbuvir plus weight-based ribavirin 
treatment for 12 weeks in 68 treatment-naïve patients and 24 
weeks in 41 retreatment patients resulted in SVR rates of 88% for 
genotype 2 and 67% in genotype 3 patients.68 Using the same 
regimen, 163 HIV-coinfected patients (including cirrhotic patients) 
were treated for 12 weeks (treatment-naïve patients with genotype 2 infection) or 24 weeks (genotype 3 or 4 and retreated genotype 2 patients); the resulting SVR rates were 88% for genotype 
2, 89% for genotype 3, and 84% for genotype 4 patients.184
Data regarding retreatment of HIV-coinfected patients and retreatment of sofosbuvir-experienced patients in that population 
are insufficient.

[Recommendations]
1. All HIV infected patients should be tested for anti-HCV antibodies (B1).
2. HCV RNA assays should be conducted in HIV infected patients 
positive for anti-HCV antibodies or negative for anti-HCV 
antibodies but with unknown liver disease (B1).
3. Antiretroviral treatment interruption to allow HCV therapy is not 
recommended (B1).
4. Interferon-free DAA treatment is a priority recommendation for 
HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, who should be treated the same as 
HCV-monoinfected patients using DAA for which information on 
drug interactions with antiretroviral agents is available (B1).
5. When HIV/HCV-coinfected patients are treated with DAAs, 
drug–drug interactions should be carefully considered, and 
consultation with an HIV treatment expert is recommended if the 
antiretroviral therapy regimen is to be modified (A1).
Chronic hepatitis C patients with HBV coinfection
The number of HBV/HCV coinfected patients is estimated to be 
15,000,000 worldwide,185 and 2.37% of anti-HCV positive patients are reported to be coinfected with HBV in South Korea.186
A 10-year follow-up study of HCV-monoinfected patients reported an HCC occurrence rate of 28%, whereas HCV/HBV-coinfected patients showed an occurrence rate of 45%, which is significantly higher.187 In addition, risks of severe and fulminant 
hepatitis increase, along with the incidence of cirrhosis and HCC, 
in HBV/HCV-coinfected patients compared to those with HBV 
monoinfection.188,189
In patients with HBV/HCV coinfection, blood HCV RNA and HBV 
DNA levels, which are indicators of the replicative status of each 
virus, should be evaluated. If HCV infection is the dominant cause 
of liver disease, the same antiviral therapy as for HCV monoinfection is recommended. Indeed, the SVR following PegIFN-α and 
ribavirin is similar to that in HCV monoinfection.190,191
Treatment of patients with HBV/HCV coinfection is identical to 
that of HCV-monoinfected patients. The risk of drug–drug interactions between DAAs and anti-HBV agents is low, with the exception of asunaprevir, for which information is lacking. Renal 
function monitoring is warranted if ledipasvir is used with tenofovir because renal toxicity can be increased (Table 16). Reactivation 
of HBV is possible during or after HCV treatment,187,192 and administration of oral antiviral agents could be indicated if significant 
proliferation of HBV is confirmed.193
In a retrospective study conducted in the United States (US), the 
reactivation of HBV during or after DAA therapy was defined as a 
1,000 IU/mL increase in HBV DNA or hepatitis B surface antigen 
(HBsAg) detection in a person who was previously negative for 
HBsAg. Nine of 62,290 patients treated with DAAs had evidence 
of HBV reactivation during DAA treatment. HBV reactivation occurred in 8 HBsAg-positive patients and one isolated anti-HBcpositive patient. Seventeen other patients had small increases in 
HBV DNA levels that did not qualify as HBV reactivation. Only 3 
of the 9 patients with HBV reactivation in this cohort exhibited 
peak alanine aminotransferase elevations ≥2 times the upper limit 
of normal.194 In contrast, cases reported to the US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System include patients with serious HBV reactivation after DAA treatment.195 That 
is, the FDA identified 29 unique reports of HBV reactivation in patients receiving DAAs from 22 November 2013 to 15 October 
2016. Two cases resulted in death and 1 case in liver transplantation. Patients in whom HBV reactivation developed were heterogeneous regarding HCV genotype, DAAs received, and baseline

HBV characteristics. At baseline, 9 patients had a detectable HBV 
viral load, 7 had positive results on HBsAg testing and an undetectable HBV viral load, and 3 had negative results on HBsAg 
testing and an undetectable HBV viral load. For the remaining 10 
patients, data points were not reported or the data were uninterpretable. Caution needs to be paid because no risk factors related 
to HBV reactivation during or after DAA therapy have been identified. Therefore, serologic tests such as HBsAg, anti-HBs, and antiHBc are recommended before DAA therapy to determine whether 
a patient has HCV and HBV co-infection.196
[Recommendations]
1. After confirming the dominant cause of liver disease in HBV/HCV 
coinfection, treatment following the same rules as monoinfection is 
recommended, and periodic HBV DNA quantitation is recommended 
during and after antiviral therapy for HCV infection (B1).
2. In patients with HBV/HCV coinfection, oral administration of antiHBV agents could be indicated if significant proliferation of HBV is 
confirmed during or after antiviral therapy for HCV infection (B1).
Hemophilia or thalassemia
An HCV infection in patients with hemophilia or thalassemia 
causes significant increases in morbidity and mortality rates compared with patients without HCV infection.197-200 Therefore, aggressive treatment of HCV infection should be considered.
Hemophilia A and B, caused by a deficiency of factor VIII and 
IX, respectively, can increase a patient’s chance of being exposed 
to HCV due to multiple transfusions necessitated by spontaneous 
and traumatic bleeds. Coinfection with HIV/HCV is not a contraindication to liver transplantation in hemophilia, and indications for 
liver transplantation in patients with hemophilia are the same as 
those in non-hemophilic individuals.111 A randomized, placebocontrolled, phase 3 study of 159 adults with HCV infection and 
sickle cell anemia, thalassemia, or hemophilia A/B or von Willebrand disease evaluated the safety and efficacy of elbasvir/grazoprevir for 12 weeks. One hundred of the 107 patients (93.5%) 
achieved SVR12; 6 relapsed, and 1 was lost to follow-up. SVR12 
was achieved in 94.7% (18 of 19), 97.6% (40 of 41), and 89.4% 
(42 of 47) of patients with sickle cell disease, β-thalassemia, and 
hemophilia A/B or von Willebrand disease, respectively. Hemoglobin levels and international normalized ratio values were similar in 
patients receiving elbasvir/grazoprevir and placebo. Among patients with hemoglobinopathies, change in mean hemoglobin levels were similar in those receiving elbasvir/grazoprevir and those 
receiving placebo.201 Another study evaluated the safety and efficacy of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir and sofosbuvir plus ribavirin in 120 
patients with HCV genotype 1–4 infection and an inherited 
bleeding disorder. Ledipasvir/sofosbuvir was administered for 12 
weeks to patients with genotype 1 or 4 infection and for 12 or 24 
weeks to treatment-experienced cirrhotic patients with genotype 
1 infection. Patients with genotype 2 and 3 infection received sofosbuvir plus ribavirin for 12 and 24 weeks, respectively. Overall, 
65% of patients had hemophilia A and 26% of patients had hemophilia B; 22% were HIV coinfected. SVR12 was achieved in 
99% (98/99) of patients with genotype 1 or 4 infection, 100% 
(5/5) in treatment-experienced cirrhotic patients with genotype 1 
infection; 100% (10/10) in patients with genotype 2 infection; 
and 83% (5/6) in patients with genotype 3 infection. No treatment discontinuations occurred due to adverse events. Bleeding 
occurred in 22 patients, but only one was considered to be related 
to the treatment.202
Severe anemia can occur due to ribavirin in thalassemia, and 
30–40% of cases can require blood transfusion at 3–4 week intervals to maintain hemoglobin at 9–10 g/dL. Therefore careful 
monitoring for hematological complications is required. However, 
the frequency of treatment discontinuation and the incidence of 
other main complications did not increase in those patients.197
[Recommendations]
1. Patients with hemophilia should be treated following the same 
rules as persons without bleeding disorders (A1).
2. Patients with thalassemia should be treated following the same 
rules as persons without hemoglobinopathy (B1).
Patients receiving immunosuppressants or cytotoxic 
chemotherapy
Although one study defined HCV reactivation as the re-emergence of or increase in HCV RNA plus elevation of ALT up to 
threefold the upper limit of normal,202 there is no universal consensus on the definition of HCV reactivation; increases in blood 
ALT and HCV RNA levels are commonly used as the criteria. 
The incidence of HCV reactivation in patients taking immunosuppressants or under cytotoxic chemotherapy is lower than that 
of HBV.202-205 For example, the reactivation rate of HCV was 0% 
(0/11) compared to 38% (3/8) for HBV in a study including 98 
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma patients receiving chemotherapy.206 
However, another study of B cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma re-

2017 KASL clinical practice guidelines: Management of chronic hepatitis C
http://www.e-cmh.org https://doi.org/10.3350/cmh.2018.1004
ported a higher incidence (26.3% vs. 2.1%) of significant ALT elevation in HCV-infected patients compared to patients without 
HCV infection, indicating that HCV reactivation does occur and 
can cause clinically significant morbidity.207
Risk factors for HCV reactivation have not been clearly identified. However, reactivation has been reported to occur more frequently in patients with hematological malignancies.203,208 HCV reactivation has also been reported in patients with solid cancers 
and in those who underwent stem cell transplantation.209,210 Although death due to HCV reactivation is rare,211 the mortality is 
similar to that of HBV once severe hepatitis occurs due to HCV reactivation.212,213
Strategies to prevent HCV reactivation in these patients have 
not been established. Conservative therapy and discontinuation 
of the offending drugs are currently recommended. However, both 
morbidity from HCV reactivation and the disadvantages of immunosuppressive drug discontinuation should be taken into account, 
and decisions should be individualized. Further studies are needed 
to explore whether DAAs might have a benefit in preventing and 
treating HCV reactivation during immunosuppressive treatment or 
cytotoxic chemotherapy.
Children
In a Korean study involving 2,080 6 to 11 year-old children in 
1996, the anti-HCV-antibody positive rate was 0.82%.214 The 
transfusion of infected blood components or vertical transmission 
is the most common cause of HCV infection in children,215 although transfusion-related HCV transmission has been rarely reported since the introduction of screening for HCV infection in 
1991 in South Korea. The global HCV infection rate among pregnant women has been reported to be 0.49–1.7%.216,217 A Korean 
study involving 5,000 pregnant women and another study with 
20,000 pregnant women reported anti-HCV-antibody positivity 
rates of 0.42–0.44%, with 57–60% of anti-HCV positive pregnant women also positive for HCV RNA.218,219
The frequency of HCV transmission was reported to be 1–6.2% 
during the perinatal period,157,220 and the evidence that Cesarean 
section reduces the risk of vertical HCV transmission is weak.221 
Although HCV RNA has been detected in human milk, the acquisition of HCV infection from human milk has not been documented. Horizontal infections among children are rare, so there is no 
need to limit routine activities, such as school life or exercise.221
An anti-HCV assay in children is recommended after 18 months 
of age because maternal antibodies can be delivered to newborns.221,222 An HCV RNA assay can be performed at 1 or 2 
months of age if earlier diagnosis is desired, although the sensitivity is as low as 22% at that time; therefore, HCV RNA assays 
should be conducted at an age older than 6 months, when the 
sensitivity reaches 85%.222,223
Spontaneous recovery is more frequent in children than in 
adults and tends to show a normal ALT level.224 In addition, HCV 
infection in children often shows slow progression of hepatic fibrosis and only rarely results in severe hepatic damage. However, 
aggressive treatment during childhood has been suggested because children usually have a regular lifestyle and show higher 
therapeutic compliance than adults. Aggressive treatment is considered in cases of continuously elevated serum AST/ALT levels or 
when advanced hepatic fibrosis is confirmed by liver biopsy. In 
addition, treatment can be also considered even in cases of normal serum AST/ALT levels or mild fibrosis on liver biopsy because 
the tools to predict disease progression are insufficient in children.225
Few data on DAA treatment are available in children. A phase 2, 
multicenter, open-label study of 100 adolescents aged 12–17 
years (mean 15 years) with genotype 1 HCV infection assessed 
the safety and efficacy of 12 weeks of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir.226 
Most participants (80%) were treatment-naïve, and 84% were infected through perinatal transmission. Overall, 98% (98/100) of 
patients achieved SVR12, and the 2 patients who did not achieve 
SVR2 were lost to follow-up either during or after treatment. The 
three most common adverse events were headache (27%), diarrhea (14%), and fatigue (13%). No serious adverse events were 
reported. The area under the concentration-time curve (tau) and 
maximum concentration values for sofosbuvir, ledipasvir, and GS331007 were within the predefined pharmacokinetic equivalence 
boundaries of 50%–200% when compared with adults from 
phase 2 and 3 studies of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir.
Although HCV-infected children were treated with interferon-α 
monotherapy due to the potential teratogenic effects of ribavirin 
in previous studies, higher SVR rates have recently been reported 
with the addition of ribavirin.227-229 Therefore, most studies have 
adopted combination therapy for children because that approach 
is standard in adults. The use of PegIFN-α in children older than 3 
years of age has been approved in North America and Europe.225
The dose of PegIFN-α 2a is 180 μg/1.73 m2/week, and the dose 
of ribavirin is 15 mg/kg twice a day. Genotype 1 and 4 patients 
should be treated for 48 weeks, and genotype 2 and 3 patients 
should be treated for 24 weeks, similar to adults.225 The SVR after 
combination therapy of PegIFN-α and ribavirin (47–53% in geno-

type 1 and 80–100% in genotypes 2 and 3) is superior to that of 
combination therapy with interferon alpha and ribavirin.227-229 Factors that predict an SVR include infection by genotypes 2 and 3 
and an HCV RNA titer <600,000 IU/mL.228,229
[Recommendations]
1. Diagnosis and evaluation of HCV in children should proceed 
following the same rules as in adults (B1). 
2. An anti-HCV assay for children is recommended at age >18 
months because maternal antibodies can be delivered to 
newborns. If an earlier assay is required, an HCV RNA assay can be 
considered after 6 months of age (B2).
3. HCV infected children aged 3–17 years should be considered 
appropriate candidates for treatment according to the same 
criteria used in adults (B1).
4. The dose of PegIFN-α 2a is 180 μg/1.73 m2
/week, and the dose of 
ribavirin is 15 mg/kg/day. Genotype 1 and 4 patients should be 
treated for 48 weeks, and genotype 2 and 3 patients should be 
treated for 24 weeks (B1).
Retreatment of patients with DAA 
TREATMENT failure 
Several clinical trials have reported the results of retreatment in 
patients who failed in prior DAA treatment. As more effective 
DAAs and new data from further clinical studies are released, the 
following recommendations could be changed. 
The SVR of 70% (38/54) was achieved after a 12-week retreatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in 54 genotype 1b CHC patients 
who failed with a 24-week daclatasvir and asunaprevir treatment.230 According to the types of previous treatment failure, the 
SVR were 18% (2/11), 69% (11/16), 94% (15/16), and 100% (7/7) 
in patients with non-response, viral breakthrough, relapse, and 
discontinuation due to adverse events, respectively. The SVR (0%, 
0/8) was significantly lower in patients with a FIB4 index of ≥3.25 
who had not responded to prior treatment, compared with the 
others (83%, 35/42). 
Forty-one genotype 1 CHC patients (34 genotype 1a, 7 genotype 1b; 19 liver cirrhosis) who relapsed following 8 or 12 weeks 
of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir treatment were retreated with ledipasvir/
sofosbuvir for 24 weeks.231 The overall SVR was 71% (29/41). The 
SVR of the patients who failed following 8 weeks of treatment 
was 80% (24/30), which was higher than the 45% (5/11) of patients who failed following 12 weeks of treatment. The SVR in 30 
patients with baseline RASs was 60% (18/30), and that of 11 patients without RASs was 100% (11/11). The SVR was 69% with 
one RAS and 50% with two or more RASs. The SVR of patients 
with NS5A RASs (ex. Y93H/N) was 33% (2/6), and that of patients with NS5B RASs (ex. S282T) was 25% (3/12).
Twenty-five genotype 1 CHC patients (22 genotype 1a, 3 genotype 1b; 5 cirrhosis) who failed with a short-term combination 
therapy of sofosbuvir and elbasvir/grazoprevir for 4, 6, or 8 weeks 
were retreated with sofosbuvir, elbasvir/grazoprevir and ribavirin 
for 12 weeks.232 The overall SVR was 100% (25/25), including all 
patients with baseline NS3 RASs (17 patients) and NS5A RASs (14 
patients).
Twenty-two genotype 1 CHC patients (20 genotype 1a, 2 genotype 1b; 6 cirrhosis) who failed with previous DAA treatments 
(ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir 14, ombitasvir/
paritaprevir/ritonavir 2) were retreated with sofosbuvir, ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, and dasabuvir with or without ribavirin.233 The overall SVR was 95% (21/22). In genotype 1a patients 
without cirrhosis, the SVR following treatment with sofosbuvir, 
ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, dasabuvir, and ribavirin for 12 
weeks was 92% (13/14), and in genotype 1a patients with cirrhosis, the SVR from the same regimen for 24 weeks was 100% (7/7). 
The SVR following sofosbuvir, ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, 
and dasabuvir for 12 weeks in genotype 1b patients was 100% 
(2/2). All 18 patients with baseline RASs achieved SVR.
A total of 263 CHC patients (101 genotype 1a, 45 genotype 1b, 
4 other genotype 1, 5 genotype 2, 78 genotype 3, 22 genotype 4, 
1 genotype 5, 6 genotype 6, 1 unknown; 121 cirrhosis) who failed 
in previous DAA treatments containing a NS5A inhibitor (NS5A 
and NS5B inhibitor 161, NS5A and NS3 inhibitor 83, NS5A inhibitor 18) were retreated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir for 
12 weeks. The overall SVR was 96% (253/263).234 The SVR of patients with genotype 1a and 1b were 96% (97/101) and 100% 
(45/45), respectively. The SVR of patients with genotype 2, 3, 4, 5, 
and 6 were 100% (5/5), 96% (74/78), 91% (20/22), 100% (1/1), 
and 100% (6/6), respectively. The SVR of patients without baseline RASs was 98% (42/43), and the SVR of patients with RASs 
was 97% (199/205). The SVR of the 121 patients with cirrhosis 
was 93% (113/121).
In total, 333 CHC patients (98 genotype 1a, 46 genotype 1b, 
64 genotype 2, 106 genotype 3, 19 genotype 4; 153 cirrhosis) 
who failed with previous DAA treatment without a NS5A inhibitor 
(NS5B inhibitors 243, NS5 inhibitors 84, NS3 inhibitors 5) were 
retreated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir or sofosbuvir/
velpatasvir for 12 weeks.234 The overall SVR was 98% (178/182) 
with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir and 90% (136/151) with

sofosbuvir/velpatasvir. By genotype, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir showed SVR of 98% (53/54) and 
89% (39/44) for genotype 1a, 96% (23/34) and 85% (21/22) for 
genotype 1b, 100% (31/31) and 97% (32/33) for genotype 2, and 
96% (52/54) and 85% (44/52) for genotype 3, respectively. All 19 
patients with genotype 4 were treated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir for 12 weeks, and their SVR was 100% (19/19). 
The SVR was 89% (67/75) without NS3 or NS5A baseline RASs, 
90% (63/70) with NS3 or NS5A baseline RASs, and 50% (2/4) 
with both NS3 and NS5A baseline RASs following 12 weeks of 
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir treatment. All 83 patients with NS3 or 
NS5A baseline RASs who received sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir for 12 weeks achieved SVR.
Sixty-nine CHC patients (32 genotype 1a, 5 genotype 1b, 14 
genotype 2, 18 genotype 3; 18 cirrhosis) who failed with previous 
DAA treatments containing sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 weeks or 
a shorter duration (sofosbuvir/velpatasvir 27, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir and ribavirin 14, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir 28) were 
retreated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir and ribavirin for 24 weeks.235
The overall SVR was 91% (63/69). The SVR by genotype was 97% 
(31/32) in genotype 1a, 100% (5/5) in genotype 1b, 93% (13/14) 
in genotype 2, and 78% (14/18) in genotype 3. The SVR of the 
patients with cirrhosis was 78% (14/18). The SVR in patients with 
NS5A RASs at baseline was 100% (5/5) in genotype 1, 89% (8/9) 
in genotype 2, and 77% (10/13) in genotype 3.
A total of 50 genotype 1 CHC patients without cirrhosis (42 
genotype 1a, 8 genotype 1b) who failed with previous DAA treatments (NS3 inhibitors 25, NS5A inhibitors 8, NS3 inhibitors and 
NS5A inhibitors 17) were retreated with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir 
with or without ribavirin for 12 weeks. The overall SVR was 92% 
(46/50).236 According to the dosage of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, 
the SVR were 100% (6/6), 95% (21/22), and 86% (19/22) with 
200/80 mg, 300/120 mg with ribavirin, and 300/120 mg, respectively. Recurrence occurred in 1 patient in each of the glecaprevir 
(300 mg)/pibrentasvir (120 mg) with ribavirin and glecaprevir (300 
mg)/pibrentasvir (120 mg) groups. Two patients in the glecaprevir 
(300 mg)/pibrentasvir (120 mg) group did not achieve SVR due to 
follow-up loss.
Ninety-one CHC patients (67 genotype 1a, 18 genotype 1b, 2 
other genotype 1, 4 genotype 4, 27 cirrhosis) who failed with a 
previous DAA treatment (NS5A inhibitors 34, NS3 inhibitors 27, 
NS3, and NS5A inhibitors 30) were retreated with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for 12 or 16 weeks.237 Overall, the SVR for the 12- and 
16-week treatments were 89% (39/44) and 91% (43/47), respectively. According to the type of previous treatment failure, the SVR 
for the 12- and 16-week treatments were 100% (14/14) and 
100% (13/13) for previous NS3 inhibitor failures, 88% (14/16) and 
94% (17/18) for previous NS5A inhibitor failures, and 79% (11/14) 
and 81% (13/16) for previous NS3 and NS5A inhibitor failures, respectively. The SVR following 12 weeks and 16 weeks of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir was 100% (13/13) and 100% (13/13) in patients 
without baseline RASs, 100% (2/2) and 100% (4/4) in patients 
with NS3 RASs, 83% (20/24) and 96% (22/23) in patients with 
NS5A RASs, and 80% (4/5) and 25% (1/4) in patients with both 
NS3 and NS5A RASs, respectively.238 Therefore, based on the clinical study results to date, glecaprevir/pibrentasvir could have a 
limited efficacy in patients with both NS3 and NS5A RASs.
The SVR following 12 weeks of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir treatment 
was 100% in 14 patients with genotype 1 CHC (8 genotype 1a, 6 
genotype 1b) who failed with 24 weeks of sofosbuvir and ribavirin 
treatment.239 Fifty-one patients (30 genotype 1a, 20 genotype 1b, 
1 genotype 3a, 14 cirrhosis) who failed with previous HCV therapy (sofosbuvir, peginterferon alpha, and ribavirin 25, sofosbuvir 
and ribavirin 20, peginterferon alpha and ribavirin without sofosbuvir 6) were retreated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir with ribavirin for 
12 weeks. The SVR was 98% (50/51).240
Fifty-two CHC patients (44 genotype 1, 2 genotype 2, 4 genotype 3, 3 genotype 4) who had previous treatment experience 
were retreated with daclatasvir and sofosbuvir for 12 weeks. The 
SVR was 98% (51/52), but the number of patients with genotypes 
2 and 3 was very small.30 In a study of genotype 3 patients given 
daclatasvir and sofosbuvir for 12 weeks, patients with prior treatment experience (sofosbuvir and ribavirin or sofosbuvir and peginterferon alpha with ribavirin) did not show a satisfactory SVR 
(71%, 5/7).83 Although the data are very limited, the combination 
of daclatasvir and sofosbuvir with ribavirin for 24 weeks could be 
considered in these patients.
In a study of genotype 3 CHC patients with cirrhosis, 53 patients who failed with previous treatment (including 2 on sofosbuvir and ribavirin combination therapy) were retreated with elbasvir/grazoprevir and sofosbuvir for 12 weeks, elbasvir/grazoprevir, 
sofosbuvir, and ribavirin for 12 weeks, or elbasvir/grazoprevir and 
sofosbuvir for 16 weeks.94 The SVR were 100% (17/17), 94% 
(17/18), and 94% (17/18), respectively.
In two studies of genotype 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 CHC patients without cirrhosis, a few of whom (1–6 patients in each genotype) had 
prior sofosbuvir-based treatment, glecaprevir/pibrentasvir for 8 
and 12 weeks showed the SVR of 97–99% and 99–100%, respectively.241,242 A total of 146 patients with genotype 1, 2, 4, 5, 
and 6 and cirrhosis (treatment experience 36, including 11 with

prior sofosbuvir-based treatment) were retreated with glecaprevir/
pibrentasvir for 12 weeks, and the SVR was 99%.40 In 131 patients with genotype 3 (treatment-experience 91, including 42 
with prior sofosbuvir-based treatment), 12 weeks of glecaprevir/
pibrentasvir treatment showed the SVR of 91% (20/22) in patients 
without cirrhosis, and 16 weeks of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir treatment showed the SVR of 96% (21/22) in patients without cirrhosis and 96% (45/47) in patients with cirrhosis.101
No studies have considered the efficacy of peginterferon in patients with DAA treatment failure. But peginterferon is expected 
to maintain its antiviral efficacy against several types of RASs, 
and therefore it could be a potential therapeutic option in patients 
who experience DAA treatment failure.
